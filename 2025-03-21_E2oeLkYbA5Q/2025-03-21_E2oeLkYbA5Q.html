    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=27.969s">President</a>  Dello Russo? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=29.03s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=30.271s">Six</a>  present, one absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=31.472s">Please</a>  rise to salute the flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=33.907s">I,</a>  too, am introduced to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=47.918s">Motions,</a>  orders, and resolutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=50.94s">15-448,</a>  offered by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=53.462s">We're</a>  going to wait on that because his father's absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=57.745s">We</a>  want his father to come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=60.608s">Offered</a>  by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the MBTA <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=64.152s">in</a>  follow-up to Council Paper 14-083, conduct a spring cleanup and beautification initiative at the West Medford Commuter Rail Station. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=74.481s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=75.942s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=78.024s">Council</a>  Paper 14-083 was filed some months ago by Councilor Caraviello, and Councilor Caraviello was working very hard with the MBTA to get some beautification initiatives completed down at the West Medford Commuter Rail Station, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=90.673s">However,</a>  the winter came and the winter left. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=92.914s">And</a>  here we are with the same exact West Medford commuter rail station that we had beforehand. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=98.016s">So,</a>  I filed this resolution to start the conversation up again, to prompt the MBTA to come down there and do a spring cleanup. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=104.059s">I'd</a>  also like to amend the resolution, Mr. President, because upon filing the resolution, I did get a couple of phone calls from area residents and business owners who have a concern about the, for lack of a better term, port-a-party that is up against the fence behind the Seafood Depot, or the Depot Station now, I guess it would be called. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=120.773s">And</a>  I'd like to see if maybe we can get that encapsulated or encased. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=124.815s">It's</a>  my understanding after discussions with Karen Rose that the governmental entity is exempt from the local board of health's oversight. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=134.238s">So</a>  hopefully this council will support my resolution and we can reach out to the MBTA and ask them to do a little bit of spring cleaning down there, Mr. President, and also do a beautification initiative to take care of that port-a-potty. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=149.957s">According</a>  to Karen Rose, there was an attorney general's opinion that was issued some years ago that would exempt the state from local Board of Health oversight on their property. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=159.983s">And</a>  that was based on a conversation I had with her today. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=164.826s">And</a>  that's what she told me. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=165.726s">And</a>  that came right out of the host's mouth. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=167.887s">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=169.748s">So</a>  we're going to amend that also to ask for a copy of the ruling that makes the MBTA a sui iuris <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=176.795s">entity.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=177.375s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=177.875s">So</a>  yeah, it's an attorney general's opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=180.076s">Uh,</a>  sometime ago in the world order.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=182.336s">So</a>  on that motion, uh, amended by council and night council care of yellow.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=186.377s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=186.697s">Mr.</a>  President, Mr. President, you know, um, I thank council night for bringing this back up again. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=191.517s">Um,</a>  I, you know, I, I worked diligently with, you know, uh, Senator Jen's office and some people from the T and, um, part of the thing was, you know, we, we did have some, we did, we did get some cleanups and painting and stuff done, but, um, I think part of the problem was, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=208.46s">The</a>  T has got a problem with how much money they can spend there. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=213.642s">Like</a>  I said, you're only allowed to spend so much of what the property is valued at, and anything over that now means going into another level, because obviously the station is not handicap accessible. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=229.191s">But</a>  last time we tried to get some smaller projects done, and some of the people weren't happy with some of the small projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=237.033s">Again,</a>  I would urge when we meet again, you know, let's take what we can get from the T and the small, let's see, no matter how small it is, and then we can go back again and ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=245.757s">But</a>  to try to get it done in a big package, because they say it takes them over their thresholds for the value of the property, and it now turns into a $14, $15 million project.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=258.803s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=259.663s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Knight as amended, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=262.705s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=263.445s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=264.746s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=266.622s">15-449</a>  offered by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=269.804s">Be</a>  resolved that the Board of Health, in follow-up to paper 14-708, propose a draft ordinance to regulate the sale and use of electronic cigarettes in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=280.932s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=282.413s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=284.494s">In</a>  recent discussions with the Board of Health, I have learned that they have filed some regulations that have strengthened the controls surrounding electronic cigarettes. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=293.66s">However,</a>  they're not necessarily where they need to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=296.503s">So</a>  I'm filing this resolution and I'm asking that the Board of Health take a look at the current ordinance and the current regulations that are in place and do their best to strengthen them. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=305.227s">In</a>  our packets this evening, Mr. President, we have correspondence from the Coalition for Responsible Retailing. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=311.17s">And</a>  the Coalition for Responsible Retailing does come out with a certain number of recommendations relative to the retailing of electronic cigarettes and tobacco products, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=319.974s">I'd</a>  ask that this document be included as part of the research when the Board of Health does sit down to take a look at this.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=327.482s">So</a>  on the motion of approval by Councilor Penter, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=332.006s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=332.726s">Motion</a>  carries. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=339.932s">15-450,</a>  offered by Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=341.253s">Be</a>  it resolved that the other- Mr. President, I withdraw the resolution at this time.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=344.455s">On</a>  the motion to withdraw by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=348.759s">15-451,</a>  offered by Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=351.381s">Be</a>  it resolved that the Eversource Electrical Project, which extends 3.2 miles underground <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=357.379s">through</a>  Medford be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=359.299s">Councilor</a>  Marks, just before you begin your presentation on this matter, I was contacted by the lead figure or representative for Eversource on this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=371.181s">And</a>  he's asked to be present at next week's council meeting to present to the council and to ask any questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=380.323s">So</a>  I don't know if that will influence your desire to speak on this matter tonight to any extent. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=386.892s">and</a>  perhaps allow them to petition us through the clerk to address the council and to have the opportunity to address all the questions that we have with themselves here. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=398.84s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=400.321s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=401.442s">And</a>  part of my resolution tonight was to request that Eversource appear before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=406.865s">So</a>  that's good news. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=408.486s">Uh,</a>  there was an open house last night at the high school, um, regarding this particular project. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=416.01s">And</a>  I guess residents who had concerns or questions could have attended the meeting last night, although it wasn't well publicized, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=426.573s">But</a>  if I could, Mr. President, because this is a project that many people are not aware of in the community, and it's going to have a devastating impact on the roadway throughout much of our area. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=444.778s">and</a>  expected to last upwards of 8 to 10 months of construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=451.342s">So,</a>  I think it's important that at least it be brought up tonight and the council can ask questions regarding this next week when they present to us formally. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=462.848s">But</a>  if I could, Mr. President, Eversource, formerly NSTAR, is proposing to install a new 115-kilovolt underground electricity transmission line <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=474.663s">and</a>  an eight-mile route connecting the Woburn substation to the Mystic substation in Everett. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=480.627s">The</a>  Medford portion of the proposed route is about 3.2 miles long and extends north to south from the Winchester line on Winthrop Street to the Somerville line on Mystic Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=495.238s">Starting</a>  at the Winchester line, the proposed route follows Winthrop Street south through the rotary <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=503.495s">at</a>  High Street and then under Mystic Valley Parkway. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=507.376s">It</a>  then turns east to follow South Street to Main Street slash Mystic Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=513.498s">Then</a>  we'll continue down Mystic Ave into Somerville and then to Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=517.84s">We'll</a>  again cross the Mystic River to finally reach the Mystic substation in Everett. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=526.583s">In</a>  most places, the plan is to bury a line eight inches in a trench <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=530.925s">about</a>  two feet wide, parallel to the existing electrical lines under the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=536.669s">The</a>  proposed project is constructed to begin sometime in 2017 and 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=543.814s">I</a>  had also general project information, and I wanted to just personally thank Mr. Krause for providing this, but it goes on to say that <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=557.672s">The</a>  8-inch steel pipe is going to be buried under our street, which will also be accompanied by 2-inch diameter polyvinyl chloride, which is PVC conduits, for relay and communication cables. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=575.542s">And</a>  they will be installed in a normal 24-inch wide by 60 inches deep. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=581.726s">So</a>  it's going to be 2 feet wide, 5 feet deep. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=585.562s">Also,</a>  Mr. President, which I found quite interesting, is they're going to have to also put roughly 17 manholes, create 17 new manholes throughout this particular stretch of the cable. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=606.036s">And</a>  the manholes will be used to splicing cables, line testing, and maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=614.563s">And</a>  they're going to be put approximately every 2,000 to 2,400 linear feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=620.085s">So</a>  I'm not sure what 3.2 miles is in the city of Medford, but out of these 17 manholes, they're going to start from Woburn all the way to Charlestown, which I think this is going to end up roughly. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=634.249s">I'd</a>  be concerned about, if we can make this part of the report, how many manholes will have to be done in the city of Medford <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=643.275s">for</a>  this 3.2 miles. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=645.856s">Also,</a>  Mr. President, Eversource will be doing roughly, in Winchester, 2.3 miles from what I heard, not compared to our 3.2 miles. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=660.804s">So</a>  our project is about a third larger than the Winchester project. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=666.646s">And</a>  they're scheduled to last roughly six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=670.288s">So</a>  when I said eight to 10 months, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=672.162s">That's</a>  just a ballpark I'm coming up with based on how long it's going to take Winchester for a smaller magnitude. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=680.885s">As</a>  part of this particular program, from what I've been told from representatives of Eversource, the city of Medford has not asked for any type of mitigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=691.649s">And</a>  I think that's important that we as a council initiate this next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=698.371s">And</a>  I would also offer that, Mr. Clerk, as an amendment to this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=702.155s">So</a>  my first amendment is, how many manhole covers will exist? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=706.137s">My</a>  second amendment is, what mitigation will be available for this community? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=713.041s">And</a>  a third issue that I wanted to bring up is, what is the length that this project will take? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=723.106s">Will</a>  there be, the fourth one, will there be public meetings in the community to discuss this project, even though it's <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=732.519s">A</a>  few years out, this project is going to encompass a lot of our roads, digging up a lot of our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=740.244s">And</a>  as we witnessed in the past, our streets never go back to the condition they were originally in when work like this takes place. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=747.929s">So</a>  I want to make sure that we are protected as residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=752.793s">Another</a>  issue is the hours of operation that work will take place on these particular lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=764.287s">And,</a>  uh, that the, uh, ever source as well as the city of method appoint a 24 hour hotline and also clerk of the works to protect the interest of the residents and, uh, our city streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=782.777s">And</a>  I'm happy to hear that, uh, cause I was going to propose that they appear before us, uh, at an upcoming meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=788.44s">And</a>  I'm happy to hear that the council president was contacted by ever source. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=792.94s">regarding</a>  this project, and that the council be furnished with any documentation that was presented at the open house last night, because I have not received any paperwork other than the paperwork that I looked up and also the paperwork I received from Mr. Krause. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=816.738s">And</a>  I know there were alternative routes that were discussed <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=824.303s">And</a>  one that I posed that was asked last night was why couldn't we go along I-93, where I-93 goes through Woburn, it goes through Winchester, it goes through Method up to where you'd want to connect into Everett. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=841.248s">To</a>  me it would make sense, less disruption for the residents of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=848.91s">And</a>  I was told that the Woban substation is on the west side of the fells. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=856.716s">And</a>  they cannot access the wiring from that side of the fells. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=864.561s">So</a>  that's why they couldn't use an alternative route. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=868.564s">And</a>  they did mention another route that talked about going through the heart of the Lawrence of States and going, I <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=877.2s">believe</a>  down Governor's Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=880.541s">And</a>  the route was actually much longer than the existing route, which didn't make much sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=885.963s">You</a>  know, I was looking for a route outside of our city and a route, a smaller route. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=891.165s">So</a>  that didn't make much sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=892.365s">But</a>  I look forward to the questioning next week and also the notification. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=897.807s">I</a>  would ask, Mr. President, and maybe through your leadership as the president, this is an extremely important issue, even though it's two years out. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=905.783s">that</a>  a reverse 9-1-1 call go out to residents that will give them ample opportunity to appear if they can or watch if they'd like the council meeting next Tuesday to get information on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=918.965s">And</a>  I would ask that we put out a reverse 9-1-1 call. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=924.226s">Reverse</a>  9-1-1, Mr. Clark.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=931.628s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=932.628s">Councilor</a>  Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=934.282s">Thank</a>  you, and I want to commend Councilor Marks for bringing this up this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=938.566s">This</a>  is certainly going to have a major impact on our community, as is the Credit Bridge, which will be going on roughly around the same time, I assume. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=948.654s">But</a>  that project is so convoluted as far as timelines and timeframes, I'm just assuming at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=956.401s">With</a>  that being said, I like Councilor Marks, all his recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=961.725s">Unfortunately,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=963.069s">According</a>  to the Councilor, there's no mitigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=966.051s">In</a>  the past, Algonquin Gas paid mitigation, but I'm not sure of the specifics of that project. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=972.214s">But</a>  if that's something we can look into. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=975.696s">But</a>  I want to thank the Councilor for bringing it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=977.917s">On</a>  a side note, if the Councilor doesn't mind, or I can make it a separate paper, can we ask for the MBTA to come in at this point with another <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=991.146s">idea</a>  slash proposal for moving the bus stop across from Medford Auto School down here in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=998.188s">We</a>  need to get that done prior to the construction commencing. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1002.569s">It's</a>  not going to be.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1003.109s">Point</a>  of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1005.089s">Point</a>  of clarification, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1006.37s">Pursuant</a>  to what Councilor Camuso, I had called him up and asked him about that, that resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1010.691s">I</a>  believe you brought it up maybe almost two months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1012.811s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1013.531s">They</a>  said they never got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1014.411s">They</a>  never got the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1016.412s">So</a>  I think we need to ask again. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1018.752s">Did</a>  you send that out? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1022.21s">No,</a>  I believe the resolution was to have it be sent to the MBTA, to their director of public relations for the purposes of can the bus stop be moved.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1031.138s">Pardon</a>  me? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1031.438s">What's</a>  it at? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1033.239s">Transportation</a>  committee?</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1044.463s">I</a>  think it's Committee of the Whole for the Craddock Bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1046.785s">Our</a>  Committee of the Whole for the Craddock Bridge, OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1049.167s">Either</a>  way, it's not going to be fair to the consumers and the people that utilize public transportation to find out two days before a shovel's on the ground that now they have to go to place X or Y or Z to catch transportation to get to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1066.34s">So</a>  if we could call that Committee of the Whole in a fairly reasonable time. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1070.564s">Last</a>  but not least, if we could also send to the Committee of the Whole <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1074.347s">We</a>  got a paper this evening, and if we want to bring this up at a different agenda item, I would put something on, but if we can, if the Councilor sees it as fit to just refer the paper from Cassandra Koudelidis, telling us that at roughly $4 million to resurface and to mill and pave Boston Ave, Forest Street, High Street, Main Street, Mystic Ave, the part that the city owns, as well as Riverside Avenue, Salem Street, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1104.507s">I,</a>  as one member of this council, we have a lot of money in reserves right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1108.711s">We</a>  also have a great bond rating due to the good fiscal management that's been going on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1114.715s">I</a>  think these roads need to be resurfaced once and for all, and I think that's a project. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1119.138s">I</a>  know as one member of the council, I would support a bond initiative or using some of the reserves for the $4 million to do a complete infrastructure improval <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1132.505s">improvement</a>  rather on these streets and these are main thoroughfares and it actually equates to what did she say as far as mileage? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1141.652s">58,000</a>  linear feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1144.194s">So</a>  it's 265,000 square feet of paving and milling that would take place and it's something that I think we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1153.041s">Now</a>  the good question would be to ask the engineer is this something that we should wait to do until after the project that Councilor Marks is referring to? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1160.762s">two</a>  years down the road, or is it, because I'm not an engineer, I don't know, they talked about five feet underground and stuff, but is it five feet, I don't know, so would it make sense to do a major initiative like this after this project, or wait until? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1175.891s">Why</a>  don't we talk to the city engineer, and then call the appropriate meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1180.174s">Do</a>  you mind if that's a B paper, Councilor, or do you want me to put it on? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1182.976s">It's</a>  all part of the main paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1186.738s">And</a>  thank you again to Councilor Marks for bringing this important item up.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1190.194s">Thank</a>  you very much to the both of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1191.674s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1193.155s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much, and thank you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1196.196s">I,</a>  too, would like to add a couple of recommendations, and I will be short. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1199.897s">The</a>  first recommendation, Mr. President, that I think is important would be that Eversource provide access to a website for the goings-on of the construction here in Medford, so that a resident can go right on their computer and type up what's going on and be updated real-time, whether it's a Twitter feed or a daily update, something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1219.022s">to</a>  allow residents the prompt and quick sharing of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1222.805s">The</a>  other item, Mr. President, that I'd like to see happen and that I'd like to recommend would be when, in fact, the road is closed up, that the repairs are done curb to curb, Mr. President, which would lead me into Councilor Camuso's amendment and the resolution that he refers to in the paper in response that we got back that Councilor Camuso refers to was a request that I made to determine what the cost would be to resurface all our emergency arteries here in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1246.545s">And</a>  in looking at this Eversource project, I don't think that it's going to go across every single major artery in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1254.751s">So</a>  with that being said, I don't see any reason why we would need to wait to begin repairing our infrastructure and resurfacing our roadways here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1263.257s">I</a>  think right now, with all the things that are going on in the city, the number one most important priority in the city should be repairing our roadways. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1270.482s">It's</a>  really a quality of life issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1272.203s">It's</a>  a safety issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1273.374s">Mr.</a>  President, and quite frankly, it's very difficult for people to be happy with the services that are being provided when they come over from Malden on a clean street and a smooth street, and they don't even have to see the sign that says, welcome to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1285.64s">They</a>  hit the road and they know. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1287.06s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, right now I think the number one priority in this city should be taking a look at resurfacing the roadways because it's causing inordinate damage to people's cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1296.225s">It's</a>  making traversing the roadways a public safety issue, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1299.246s">So</a>  thank you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1300.287s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1301.863s">for</a>  bringing these issues forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1303.064s">I</a>  support this measure in 110%, Mr. President, and I move for approval.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1308.368s">So</a>  on the motion of, on Councilor Mark's motion as amended, Councilor Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1313.672s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1315.333s">I</a>  agree with Councilor Camuso, and I think maybe we should wait for the engineer to see which streets are going to be affected, and I'd hate to see them dug up twice, because usually when they dig them up and put them back, they don't do a good job. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1328.403s">Also,</a>  on the letter here, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1331.32s">Could</a>  I recall that Representative Donato received funding for Riverside Avenue through the transportation bond bill that was filed last year?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1339.984s">It</a>  didn't go through. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1341.144s">I'm</a>  sorry, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1341.665s">It</a>  didn't go through.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1342.845s">It</a>  didn't go through?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1344.326s">The</a>  bond bill didn't go through.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1345.446s">Well,</a>  according to the representative, the money is sitting at the state house waiting for us to go and get it as part of the garage package. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1352.449s">No,</a>  garage didn't go through either. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1354.37s">That's</a>  not what the representative says, but Mr. President, if you could check if <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1361.207s">if</a>  that funding ever went through, through the bond bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1364.688s">We'll</a>  check on that for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1365.688s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1366.388s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1366.748s">So</a>  on the motion for approval by Councilor Knight, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1371.629s">Mr.</a>  President.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1372.749s">Councilor</a>  Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1375.31s">Just</a>  regarding the underground electricity proposal, I think we have to be mindful, and I know Councilor Knight has brought this up on several occasions, that Winthrop Circle has already been disrupted <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1390.324s">for</a>  many, many months regarding the drainage and gas projects that have been going on and still going on, right, in that particular area, and coupled with this potential project that's going to run right through that area again. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1404.675s">You</a>  know, I think it's important we as a community, and I'm not sure what we can do to stand up and say, you know what, enough's enough with this particular digging and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1417.604s">I</a>  also found, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1419.414s">When</a>  I looked at the general project information, I'm not opposed to, because it says the project's purpose is to improve reliability electricity transmission within the greater Boston area and to address thermal overloads within the existing electric transmission line in combination with other planned greater Boston area transmission upgrades. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1440.545s">The</a>  project provides a system with substantial flexibility to accommodate load growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1445.789s">So</a>  I'm not opposed to expanding the electricity and the ability to gain electricity north of Boston, but I'm not sure why it has to be done on the backs of every resident in this community and the inconvenience of digging our roads and digging trenches constantly in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1466.059s">And</a>  in my opinion, to get very little, if anything in return, is troublesome to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1474.003s">And</a>  I would hope that <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1476.315s">whatever</a>  the decision is that we play a vital role at the table in deciding what the impact is going to be in this community and how much we think we can take as a community on the vitality and also the integrity of our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1493.243s">And</a>  that should be the utmost importance of all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1496.004s">So</a>  I just wanted to make that point that the residents on Winthrop and High Street and that whole general area have been going through all this construction <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1506.153s">And</a>  to say in another two years you're going to be facing something similar is a problem, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1512.216s">And</a>  hopefully we'll get more answers next Tuesday.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1515.898s">We</a>  all look forward to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1516.839s">So,</a>  on the motion for approval, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1519.38s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1520.16s">Motion</a>  carries. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1522.202s">15-453</a>  offered by Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1524.603s">Be</a>  it resolved that the ongoing school sex survey be questioned as it is being challenged by mass resistance. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1533.688s">Councilor</a>  Penta.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1535.238s">Mr.</a>  President, before I speak, we have in attendance this evening the president of the state organization from Mass Resistance, Mr. Brian Kamenker. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1545.203s">And</a>  I'd like to have him come forward and give his reasoning first before I make my comments.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1552.887s">Sir,</a>  please come forward and state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1560.15s">And</a>  are you an official of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1564.86s">No,</a>  I'm not. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1566.14s">He's</a>  part of a state organization.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1567.941s">My</a>  name is Brian Kamaker. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1570.101s">I</a>  live at 84 Stanaford Street in Newton. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1575.643s">Our</a>  organization, Mass Resistance, is a pro-family group in Massachusetts, and we've been active for over 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1585.206s">We</a>  advocate for parental rights in the public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1590.747s">I'm</a>  considered an expert myself in parental notification, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1595.7s">I</a>  wrote the Parental Notification Law in Massachusetts, Mass General Law, Chapter 71, Section 32A, which I have here, which deals with parental notification in the public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1613.631s">This</a>  past week, I testified before in the State House for a bill that we have, H-283, regarding <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1625.233s">surveys</a>  that are being given across the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1628.755s">These</a>  are these youth risk behavior surveys and other surveys which are created by the state of Massachusetts and they're given by the various cities and towns throughout Massachusetts in middle schools and high schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1645.763s">These</a>  surveys have very graphic sexual and other kinds of <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1651.495s">disturbing</a>  questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1655.996s">In</a>  fact, the testimony that I and several other parents gave was so disturbing that it was covered by the local Fox News, WRK Radio, and WGBH. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1669.2s">The</a>  questions on these surveys given statewide in middle school and high school have to do with <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1679.109s">Suicide,</a>  whether you've contemplated suicide, how many times you've had sexual intercourse. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1691.717s">For</a>  instance, how many times in the past three months, in the past three months, how many people have you had sexual intercourse with? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1698.501s">And</a>  the answers go from zero to six or more. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1702.564s">How</a>  old were you when you first had sexual intercourse? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1705.065s">11</a>  to 17. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1708.175s">When</a>  you have sexual intercourse, do you drink alcohol? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1713.818s">Many</a>  of these questions have to do with drugs, have to do with family life, have to do with illegal activities, such as do you carry a gun? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1726.664s">And</a>  they're very, very disturbing. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1728.584s">The</a>  problem with these questions is, and I had to deal with them when my own kids were in school, is that parents are very, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1737.412s">almost</a>  never notified about this, and it's very difficult for them to see the test beforehand. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1745.274s">There</a>  are also local tests. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1747.575s">I</a>  have a survey here that was given here in Medford, which I received from a parent here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1754.157s">This</a>  was given in 2013, grade six through 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1758.978s">Some</a>  of the questions on this Medford test, and I'll leave all these tests for you, have to do with <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1768.211s">How</a>  many times have you used cocaine in the past 30 days? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1771.492s">And</a>  the answer goes from zero to 40 or more times. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1776.334s">Marijuana,</a>  heroin, LSD, ecstasy, things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1781.716s">Some</a>  of the other questions have to do with depression. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1786.358s">Sometimes</a>  I think life is not worth it, yes or no. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1789.56s">At</a>  times I think I'm no good at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1793.362s">Questions</a>  about your family life. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1800.13s">Here's</a>  some questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1801.591s">Do</a>  you feel close to your mother? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1803.212s">Do</a>  you share your thoughts and feelings with your mother? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1806.194s">Do</a>  you enjoy spending time with your mother? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1808.736s">Do</a>  you enjoy spending time with your father? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1811.578s">Things</a>  like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1812.959s">These</a>  questions are very intrusive. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1815.381s">And</a>  how it affects a child, especially some of these younger children, is very disturbing to parents and others. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1825.784s">The</a>  parent, in this case, only found out about this test because she made an effort to get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1833.908s">Otherwise,</a>  she wouldn't have known. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1836.089s">So</a>  what we are hoping here is that various city councils, such as yourselves, will send a message to the state legislature and saying that, you know, we want this bill passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1855.089s">you're</a>  passing this resolution, a city council rather than a school committee will lend great credibility to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1865.718s">So</a>  I want to thank you for giving me permission to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1869.181s">And</a>  I could certainly take any questions that you have.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1873.825s">Mr.</a>  President, I want to thank the president for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1878.188s">I</a>  think the bill, the intent of the bill needs to be said. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1880.11s">It's</a>  to protect school children. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1881.728s">from</a>  obscene, sexually graphic, psychologically intrusive surveys conducted by the public schools without parental knowledge. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1888.873s">The</a>  surveys also ask you to reveal their criminal activity, personal family matters, and other intimate issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1896.039s">That's</a>  the legislation that House Bill number 382 describes itself to. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1902.043s">I</a>  have no problem as a city councilor, and hopefully my council colleagues would be supportive of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1907.387s">And</a>  I think it's fair to say <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1909.258s">There</a>  was an equal representation from both Democrats and Republicans on Beacon Hill who have signed on to support this bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1915.882s">The</a>  piece of legislation that you're talking about dating back to, was it 1975, 1978 that you wrote it?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1924.888s">Oh,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1925.408s">The</a>  legislation, the current law, was passed in 1996 and signed by Bill Weld.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1932.772s">And</a>  that piece of legislation is very explicit as it relates to surveys being disseminated by the public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1938.837s">for</a>  which parental notification needs to be given before the child either takes the survey or has the opt-out provision that they could take the survey.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1948.181s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1948.961s">The</a>  current law, unfortunately, does not include surveys, which is why we have this new bill before the state house. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1955.083s">And</a>  the new bill would require parental opt-in, that is written permission, for these kinds of surveys.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1963.166s">It's</a>  disturbing, and not to be repetitive, but when they ask questions, how old were you when you first had <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1968.94s">sex,</a>  annual, oral, vagina, for the first time. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1972.001s">And</a>  then it says, you know, in the past three months, how many people have you had sex with? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1976.082s">And</a>  it goes on to talk about whether you've taken cocaine, heroin. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1979.503s">And</a>  it also talks about, do your parents text while they drive? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1982.984s">And</a>  there's a whole host of issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1984.724s">And</a>  I believe, if I understand it correctly in reading the bill and speaking to folks up in the Statehouse on the legislative committee, their concern is when a child goes to school, it's got to be more than making the child be physically safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=1997.542s">The</a>  child now has to be psychologically, emotionally not disturbed because of going to school and taking these type of surveys. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2005.527s">And</a>  so to do that, they feel that this type of legislation would at least put the parent on an equal playing field. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2012.631s">At</a>  least they would be advised of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2014.392s">Now</a>  here in the city of Medford, I know you said, I think the survey was given in 2013. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2018.474s">And</a>  some parents, again, once they find out after the fact, it's too late after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2025.118s">I</a>  think another problem with these surveys, and some of these kids who are much younger, when they go to answer it, they may not know how to answer it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2031.923s">And</a>  they may just be writing all kinds of numbers that can escalate, yeah, 1, 5, 4, without really knowing. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2037.967s">Maybe</a>  they don't even understand what the questions mean. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2040.409s">How</a>  do you get somebody in the fourth, fifth, and the sixth grade to understand all of this? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2045.032s">Yes,</a>  today, they may be more advanced because of what's on television and what's in the movies and stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2049.615s">But</a>  some of this stuff is really personal. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2051.877s">And</a>  it's something that is a parental responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2054.18s">It's</a>  their responsibility to make sure that their child understands what's on here if they are going to take it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2059.581s">So</a>  with that being said, it's not appropriate for the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2064.222s">I</a>  don't think it's appropriate for any school, public, private, or whatever, to make any decision on behalf of something that a parent has a responsibility and should have control over. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2073.785s">A</a>  kid should not have to go to school, have that survey, and have the teacher say, we have to take this survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2079.386s">And</a>  the parents have absolutely no idea on that particular day that that survey was given. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2084.304s">And</a>  I think that's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2086.225s">And</a>  I applaud you, and I applaud your organization and your efforts. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2089.307s">And,</a>  you know, there's a state rep up from Lowell. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2092.229s">His</a>  name is Randy Mom. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2094.491s">And</a>  I believe he's a foreigner who immigrated here to this country, and unfortunate enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2098.674s">And</a>  he said, this type of a survey is almost communistic, because he comes from a country, I believe it was Cambodia, and these are the type of questions that they would have to deal with.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2108.585s">Yeah,</a>  you were referring to the state rep from Lowell recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2111.787s">Yeah,</a>  he was a committee member, and he heard the testimony, and that was his reaction.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2116.451s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2117.972s">And</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I believe both chairpresidents from the House and Senate are not only in favor of it, but they appreciate the testimony that was given because it's being talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2128.038s">And</a>  maybe this can be sent back to the State Department of Education that you cannot. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2132.722s">I</a>  mean, if you want to have these type of surveys to go out, communities and parents <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2138.062s">need</a>  to be informed ahead of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2139.503s">The</a>  parent needs to see the survey, not be informed. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2142.205s">They</a>  need to see the survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2143.046s">Do</a>  you want your child to take the survey? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2145.047s">And</a>  either they opt out or they opt in, one way or the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2147.569s">But</a>  for what purpose it serves, I don't know, other than the fact that you're going to have some of these results turn around. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2153.274s">And</a>  if I understand it correctly, in some cities and towns, these surveys were supposed to be anonymous, if I understood it correctly, but some people were identified by a number.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2162.22s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2162.6s">I</a>  was told that in Medford, this was what I was told by this mother who gave me this survey, was that the surveys had the student number on it, and they were passed out that way.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2173.222s">And</a>  that doesn't speak well for a school system that allows that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2176.583s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I would move, and again, I would hope that the city council would support House Bill 382. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2184.204s">I'll</a>  read it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2185.265s">It's</a>  to protect schoolchildren from obscene, sexually graphic, psychologically intrusive surveys conducted by the public schools without <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2192.279s">parental</a>  knowledge. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2193.44s">These</a>  surveys also seek to ask you to reveal their criminal activity, personal family matters, and other intimate issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2200.943s">And</a>  it's House Bill 382. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2203.325s">That's</a>  the bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2204.185s">It's</a>  up in — there was heard on, I believe, on May 6th. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2207.907s">It</a>  was a full House. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2208.747s">You</a>  had — you had mothers there, you had single parents there, over and beyond mass resistance, and you had legislatures who spoke white, quite frankly, in favor of this because <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2220.123s">You</a>  know, this is something that just needs to be stopped before it gets out of hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2223.424s">So</a>  that's the motion.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2226.504s">That's</a>  the motion on the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2227.964s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2229.225s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2230.465s">Um,</a>  I thank council for bringing this up because, uh, some years ago I had a daughter that was involved, wasn't a written survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2239.346s">It</a>  was an individual survey where they personally ask questions and they asked questions that were totally inappropriate of a third for a third grader. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2247.368s">And</a>  they were, they were asking personal questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2249.452s">about</a>  their home life, their parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2251.753s">And</a>  again, I would hope this stops, especially with the younger kids who don't really know the difference of the questions they're answering. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2260.537s">So</a>  again, I applaud your efforts.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2263.739s">Do</a>  we have a text before us, Mr. Councilor Penta?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2269.722s">Well,</a>  this is what the bill is, in essence. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2271.123s">It's</a>  right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2271.663s">I</a>  mean, I just read it to you what the gut of the bill is.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2276.505s">A</a>  motion of Councilor Penta? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2278.573s">All</a>  those in favor?</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2280.354s">Councilor</a>  Camuto. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2282.275s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2284.395s">Just</a>  a quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2285.536s">Now,</a>  are you a volunteer at Mass Resistance, or are you a paid consultant or an employee?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2292.359s">I'm</a>  a paid employee. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2294.72s">I'm</a>  the president. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2296.08s">I'm</a>  sorry? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2296.72s">I'm</a>  the president. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2297.941s">I'm</a>  a paid employee. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2299.381s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2300.262s">And</a>  Mass Resistance, I've known about it a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2306.292s">exactly</a>  what type of things do you guys lobby behind, and it's mostly family issues, is that correct?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2311.856s">Right,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2313.117s">Our</a>  original name was Parents' Rights Coalition. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2317.759s">Mass</a>  resistance is sort of a catchy name. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2320.841s">We</a>  changed that maybe, oh, I don't know, eight or nine years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2324.364s">But</a>  our actual legal name is Parents' Rights Coalition. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2329.867s">So</a>  that's the official name.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2331.568s">Now,</a>  the Parents' Rights Coalition, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2335.568s">Was</a>  it under them, I think it was under that name, that you were strong opposition to the same-sex marriage and put up on Beacon Hill and it was brought forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2345.796s">Is</a>  that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2346.397s">Was</a>  that that organization or the new one?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2349.299s">Yeah,</a>  we were also involved with that also. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2351.982s">Yes,</a>  we were opposed to same-sex marriage. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2354.464s">It's</a>  not the same organization.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2356.326s">No,</a>  mass resistance is very much <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2360.259s">behind</a>  in opposition to same-sex marriage. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2364.423s">I</a>  believe as recent as within the last few weeks with the court case up in Washington, D.C. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2368.686s">Is</a>  that correct?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2369.507s">Yes,</a>  that's correct.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2371.008s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2371.408s">So,</a>  all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2374.031s">I</a>  just wanted to get a better understanding on what we're looking at supporting this evening, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2379.955s">And</a>  quite honestly, I don't know much about the bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2385.86s">And</a>  as Councilor Knight alluded to a few weeks ago, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2388.91s">The</a>  democratic process, as you know, it can be a bill that's submitted one way, and by the end, by the time it hits the governor's desk, it's totally different. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2396.933s">And</a>  that's the democratic and legislative process. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2399.614s">So,</a>  at this point, I will not be supporting this this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2403.275s">Just</a>  as a point of... And thank you very much for... Oh, yeah.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2405.816s">This</a>  bill, as you said, does have equal Democratic and Republican support.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2412.018s">I</a>  understand that, but I also am very cognizant of the fact that the legislative process, you can start out with the text and the verbiage of one bill being <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2419.26s">A,</a>  B, C, D, and then by the end of it, it's totally extrapolated, things added, things taken out. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2424.344s">And</a>  I understand, and I have my own personal feelings about the surveys in the public schools, but I'm certainly not going to take a vote based upon my own personal feelings, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2436.793s">And</a>  number two, I just, I don't know where it's going. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2441.137s">I</a>  would feel better seeing how it comes out of committee, if it comes out of committee, and then saying whether we support it or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2448.917s">I</a>  know in the past, some of the initiatives that mass resistance has been adamantly against the same sex marriage. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2455.241s">I'm</a>  on the other side of the issue on that particular matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2458.544s">And</a>  at this point, I just don't have enough information to be quite frank with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2462.666s">So</a>  I don't feel comfortable supporting something early on as this in the legislative process, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2469.971s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2471.292s">Just</a>  as a point of clarification to Councilor Camuso's comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2473.894s">Point</a>  of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2476.276s">We</a>  have filed bills here from the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2478.671s">that</a>  have made radical changes by the time it came out. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2482.333s">All</a>  I'm talking about is the intent of what the bill wants to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2486.055s">If</a>  the bill has to be amended, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2488.536s">It</a>  may not even come out of committee, but it looks like it will come out of committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2491.598s">The</a>  intent of this is to protect schoolchildren, but the law is very specific, as it's written right now, that parents, when surveys such as this are going to be disseminated, the parents need to be <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2504.057s">told</a>  ahead of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2505.777s">Schools</a>  cannot just go out there and do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2508.338s">And</a>  that's what the intent of this bill is. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2510.898s">So</a>  all I'm asking you for is to support the intent of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2514.619s">Then</a>  they can add it up, but to add it down after that, it's letting people know that, you know, if you want your child protected from this type of pornography in plain English, you know, now's the time to speak up. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2526.702s">Councilor</a>  Camuso.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2528.062s">And,</a>  uh, I appreciate the council is, um, um, opinions, but as I stated, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2535.239s">Just</a>  in our own homeroom petitions, by the time things get to the governor's desk, it's changed tremendously. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2541.624s">We've</a>  dealt with that, as Councilor Penta said, right here, with stuff that was initiated in this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2546.847s">And</a>  it was a lot of changes by the time it left the city clerk's office with the mayor and the council signatures on it, all the way to the time it got back to Governor Deval Patrick's desk. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2555.714s">And</a>  for that reason, I'm not supporting this this evening.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2558.696s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caruso. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2559.757s">On</a>  the motion approved by Councilor Penta, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2565.56s">Councilor</a>  Knight wishes to be recorded in opposition.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2568.762s">I'd</a>  like to reflect that mass resistance has been designated as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center in March of 2008, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2578.09s">It's</a>  formerly the Article 8 Alliance, which led the charge on Beacon Hill to oppose same-sex marriage here in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2584.495s">Those</a>  are politics that I can't agree with, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2586.816s">So</a>  for that reason and that reason only, I'll be asking to be recorded in opposition.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2590.699s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2591.94s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2594.284s">I'd</a>  like to answer that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2595.364s">Point</a>  of clarification, Councilor Nanta.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2597.486s">Councilor</a>  Knight just made a remark that it's a hate organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2602.109s">If</a>  it was such a hate organization, they wouldn't even be entertaining this on Beacon Hill, and they wouldn't be getting the support from both sides of the aisle. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2608.394s">But</a>  to say that they're a hate organization, I don't see anything in front of me that says they're a hate organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2612.237s">That's</a>  your opinion, for what you maybe read someplace.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2615.519s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2616.94s">I</a>  believe the Southern Poverty Law Center in March of 2008, which I did state, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2621.757s">made</a>  this designation, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2623.477s">I'm</a>  not here to debate the merits of the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2625.898s">That's</a>  why I'm not voting for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2627.258s">That's</a>  why I recused myself when the debate was going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2629.658s">I'm</a>  in opposition to the bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2630.739s">I'd</a>  like to address that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2632.759s">Sir,</a>  you'll be recognized at the appropriate time. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2636.02s">Mr.</a>  President, I think that the debate has ceased at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2638.4s">We're</a>  taking a vote on the matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2639.48s">What</a>  are we talking about? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2640.32s">We</a>  can talk about it, Adam. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2641.38s">Just</a>  let people talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2643.021s">That's</a>  why I left. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2643.821s">I</a>  didn't want to interrupt the debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2645.241s">I</a>  wanted to give you guys an opportunity to go through the reasons why I think this is good legislation. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2648.862s">I</a>  just want the record to reflect. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2650.442s">why</a>  I'm in opposition, that's all. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2651.643s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2651.843s">There</a>  are Catholic organizations, there are all kinds of Tea Party organizations that have the same designation.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2657.948s">You'll</a>  be recognized when it's time for you to spoke. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2661.83s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2662.471s">I</a>  was just wondering maybe if I can ask the gentleman, is this a bill that was introduced this year only or has this been before the state legislature previous years?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2674.4s">It</a>  was before the state legislature last session. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2678.182s">We</a>  didn't <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2679.583s">really</a>  have a chance to push it last session hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2683.787s">This</a>  session, we had more information. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2686.529s">We</a>  had more parents who were very upset. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2690.072s">So</a>  it really got its legs this session. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2693.675s">It</a>  also got many more signers on this session of both parties once they saw what happened.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2702.162s">Are</a>  you aware of any other states that have similar state laws?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2706.952s">No,</a>  I haven't really looked into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2710.473s">It</a>  seems to me that there is a federal law similar, but that it doesn't, it's not as, you know, we're looking into that too, whether there's a federal law that, you know, may or may not cover certain school programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2726.778s">But,</a>  you know, we haven't looked into other states on this, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2733.68s">All</a>  we can say is that there's a tremendous amount <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2737.957s">emotion</a>  on parents when they see this. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2741.919s">So</a>  just present also.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2745.36s">Has</a>  there been any discussion with the teachers associations or administrative associations throughout the Commonwealth?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2756.344s">I've</a>  only spoken with teachers and administrators informally. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2762.703s">Many</a>  of them are uncomfortable about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2764.924s">I've</a>  spoken with two or three teachers who really don't like having to do this, but feel almost forced to. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2773.907s">But</a>  I haven't had formal discussions with teachers' organizations. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2779.009s">It'd</a>  be interesting to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2780.349s">It's</a>  a good idea.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2781.349s">Mr.</a>  President, just if I could, you know, I think at the very least, and I know I think my council colleagues are looking for at least <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2792.02s">an</a>  intent vote tonight, but I would feel more comfortable, I'll be quite frank, I didn't read the piece of legislation, although my council colleague just referred to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2802.522s">I</a>  would like to see this maybe come before a subcommittee so we can have some dialogue and discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2808.764s">This</a>  is an important issue and I'm not prepared tonight to take any type of vote on whether it's intent or whether it's the actual language here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2820.353s">There's</a>  a motion for approval on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2823.434s">I</a>  would ask that it be sent to a subcommittee, Mr. President, for discussion.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2829.437s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2831.858s">Mr.</a>  President, we also run into the situation right now where we have an elected body, the Medford School Committee, that sets school policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2838.801s">And</a>  I wonder if this very issue of being able to opt in and opt out of a survey could be handled by way of policy at the local level as opposed to state legislation and the state legislature taking action. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2850.143s">I</a>  think if, in fact, our elected school committee feels as though there's a need to stop this, our elected school committee would implement a policy thereof.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2856.207s">Point</a>  of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2859.268s">Point</a>  of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2860.069s">Councilor</a>  Pentland here.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2861.089s">The</a>  gentleman at the podium, you indicated, sir, that the city of Medford in 2013 gave up that survey, correct?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2869.154s">It</a>  gave a similar survey, which I read from, which I have here.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2875.318s">And</a>  that survey that was given out, parents weren't advised ahead of time.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2879.128s">The</a>  parent that I spoke to said that they were advised in a very general way, but not specifically that these kinds of questions would be asked.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2896.601s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2897.922s">You've</a>  made your point. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2899.103s">Councilor</a>  Knight, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2900.605s">Ma'am,</a>  you wish to address us? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2902.106s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2904.107s">Hi,</a>  I'm Jean Martin, 10 Cumming Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2905.828s">And</a>  I just want to say that the schools don't want to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2910.712s">This</a>  is not something, this is thrown upon them because kids are behaving in these ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2916.175s">So</a>  what I want to say is it's up to the parents to get more proactive. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2919.898s">And</a>  this gentleman, this is reactive. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2922.22s">The</a>  schools react when the kids are behaving in certain ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2925.262s">And</a>  we know it goes on in buses, it goes on in parks, it goes on, you know, whether it's a drug activity, whether it's sexual activity, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2933.07s">So</a>  the thing is, the onus is on the parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2935.511s">And</a>  I would like the gentleman there to get all parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2938.552s">He</a>  might be a good parent, but there's a lot of parents out there that aren't talking to their kids about these topics. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2944.534s">And</a>  when the parents don't do their job, what happens is it ends up being thrown on the school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2949.575s">And</a>  it's a burden on the school system, and it shouldn't be on the school system, to raise the kids with these kind of issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2955.697s">And</a>  I just wanted to put that out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2956.998s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2957.678s">Thank</a>  you, ma'am. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2958.576s">There's</a>  a motion for approval on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2961.497s">The</a>  chair is in doubt.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2966.179s">On</a>  the motion, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2968.24s">The</a>  lady that just spoke, I wholeheartedly disagree with her because number one, to say that the responsibility is on the parent. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2974.042s">The</a>  responsibility can be not be on the parent if the parent doesn't know what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2977.784s">The</a>  responsibility is within the public school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2980.425s">If</a>  that's where these surveys are being disseminated through by the State Department of Education and they disseminate it to a public school, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2986.69s">And</a>  then that has to go down to the student. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2988.491s">The</a>  parents should be informed ahead of time that this type of a survey, and they should be able to read it ahead of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2993.915s">So</a>  that way, their decision is informed. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=2996.377s">You</a>  can't take a fourth, a fifth, or a sixth grader and have them sign a survey or take a survey without a parent knowing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3003.181s">That's</a>  wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3004.302s">That's</a>  the whole intent behind this piece of legislation, to inform the parent ahead of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3009.685s">And</a>  that's what the law is, Chapter 71, Section 32A. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3013.448s">That's</a>  what it says, and unfortunately, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3015.41s">Cities</a>  and towns are not following the rules as they should. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3018.011s">There's</a>  a motion before us.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3021.612s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3023.792s">Um,</a>  just for the gentlemen, um, I believe, I don't know if it was you or one of my council colleagues said that Medford did notify the parents, but it was vague.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3034.595s">That's</a>  what I was told by the parent. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3036.275s">That</a>  was very vague.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3037.116s">So</a>  Medford is following the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3038.656s">If,</a>  if that's the case, we don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3040.556s">You're</a>  getting told secondhand. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3041.617s">I'm</a>  getting told third hand.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3043.143s">But</a>  I think the problem is that the law is vague. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3046.306s">The</a>  law just says you have to notify in some way. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3049.328s">And</a>  so these parents are told, well, it's a health survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3052.671s">They're</a>  not told about these questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3055.073s">And</a>  that's what really infuriates them is because once they find out, they're very, very upset. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3061.398s">So</a>  that's the problem, unfortunately.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3063.92s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3065.161s">Thank</a>  you, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3065.842s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3067.023s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3067.663s">Mr.</a>  President, you know, while I am opposed to the survey, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3072.935s">I'd</a>  like to see if Councilor Penta wouldn't mind changing this to just removing the mass resistance group here because I'm not familiar with the group either. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3082.383s">Though</a>  like I say, I am in opposition to the sex survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3086.786s">But</a>  I say, and I say, I'm not familiar with this group and I don't want to give a voice of support to a group I'm not familiar with. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3095.413s">But</a>  I am in favor of not doing the survey.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3101.241s">going</a>  to remove what word from your motion?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3104.225s">I</a>  can revert to it, and support the intent of House Bill 382, which is to protect children from obscene, sexually graphic, and psychologically intrusive service. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3116.638s">I</a>  have it here for you, Eddie.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3120.062s">On</a>  that motion, the chair is in doubt.</p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3123.956s">I</a>  just wanted to respond. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3126.037s">I'm</a>  not for the survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3127.258s">I</a>  think it's inappropriate and over the top, but I'm just, the reason why these surveys come about is because the schools know what's going on more times than some of the parents and they need to be more involved with their kids because kids talk to other kids and then word gets around in the school systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3144.899s">of</a>  who's doing what. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3146.32s">That's</a>  what I wanted to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3147.621s">So</a>  I think that a lot of those questions are over the top. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3150.942s">I</a>  agree with you there. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3152.183s">And</a>  it shouldn't be in the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3154.084s">But</a>  the reason why it ends up in the schools is because parents aren't following up and talking to their kids about these inappropriate topics. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3160.928s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3162.169s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3163.31s">We</a>  now, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll on the motion by Councilor Penta.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3253.017s">It</a>  was filed by Representative Colleen Gary. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3256.299s">I</a>  believe she's from Dracut, a Democrat. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3259.02s">Not</a>  by request. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3261.962s">Not</a>  by request, you said? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3263.002s">No,</a>  not by request.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3270.558s">Mr.</a>  President, I would just respectfully ask my colleague to send this to a subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3275.42s">I'd</a>  like to personally have some dialogue and discussion with members of the school committee, the administration, to see what their thoughts are behind this. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3284.883s">I</a>  could see the face value on it, but I'm not quite sure I'm prepared tonight to vote on this because once we take a stance on the intent, Mr. President, as Councilor Camuso mentioned, this legislation could go in a number of <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3299.606s">different</a>  directions, and I don't know if, as a body, I want to be on record, depending on how this legislation comes out and how it may be revised. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3312.695s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3313.555s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3366.232s">His</a>  ambassadorship wasn't blocked.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3368.553s">Well,</a>  no, no, but it was until he agreed to no longer do anything that would protect the rights of homosexual activity in the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3377.698s">I</a>  remember a landmark, something to do with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3381.5s">There</a>  was a human foreign relations subcommittee at the time, and I believe it was <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3387.319s">The</a>  group might be the national group.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3390.821s">I</a>  don't recall.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3394.643s">Senator</a>  Jesse Helms at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3395.963s">That's</a>  who it was.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3396.524s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3397.764s">I'd</a>  like to address this issue of the Southern Poverty Law Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3403.507s">That</a>  group has been debunked on all sides of the political spectrum because of their activities of designating anybody on the conservative side <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3417.592s">on</a>  certain issues as a hate group. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3419.593s">I</a>  mean, Catholic groups, tea parties, immigration groups, people like Glenn Beck, Michelle Bachman, members of Congress, over 1,000 groups and hundreds of people have been designated by this ridiculous organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3437.483s">So</a>  it's very insulting to use that as anything that makes, you know, with any credibility.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3559.282s">My</a>  name is Tamar Siegel. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3560.563s">I</a>  live at 155 Forest Street here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3563.715s">And</a>  if I could just talk for one minute about the library line item in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3569.744s">I</a>  understand the budget is on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3572.809s">Is</a>  my understanding that in order for libraries to be accredited by their governing board <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3578.717s">They</a>  need to get a percentage, a specific percentage of the city budget allotted to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3585.125s">Medford</a>  is not getting that kind of money to be accredited. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3589.009s">They</a>  have the opportunity to get a waiver and there are other cities that do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3593.074s">There</a>  was some years ago when there were budget cuts across the board, many cities in the area in the Minutemen system <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3599.903s">went</a>  under budget, they got this waiver, and they were accredited for a certain period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3605.385s">Most</a>  of those cities and towns are now back up to full funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3610.027s">Medford</a>  is not one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3611.288s">Medford</a>  is still well below the, I tried to do the math, I don't know the exact number, but well below the percentage to get their accreditation. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3621.052s">The</a>  percentage that is missing of money is for staffing. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3624.977s">The</a>  library is understaffed. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3626.399s">I</a>  believe they're missing at least two staffing positions that used to be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3631.667s">So</a>  as a library person, I love the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3634.811s">I</a>  use it a great deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3636.705s">My</a>  kids use it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3638.387s">If</a>  the Medford Library is not accredited, what that does for them, my understanding, is they lose their connection to the Minuteman system. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3647.274s">They</a>  lose all their online resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3651.787s">The</a>  referencing that you can do online, they lose the ability to do interlibrary loan. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3657.913s">It</a>  basically makes the library sort of an island with no connection to any other libraries in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3664.74s">And</a>  I think that would be a shame. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3665.901s">And</a>  so I wanted to just make sure it was brought to your attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3669.874s">that</a>  that's an issue as you discuss numbers for the budget and just hope that that would be something that you all could take into account. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3676.555s">I</a>  think the library is something that's incredibly important in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3680.436s">You</a>  know, my fifth grader reminded me today that even in the public schools, they log into the Medford Public Library from school and use the resources there. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3689.998s">And</a>  so I think that if we lost that, it would be a real shame for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3695.239s">So</a>  that's, I just wanted to bring that to your attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3698.58s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3699.877s">Thank</a>  you for coming down tonight, ma'am. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3703.738s">Councilor</a>  Marks, does your button not work?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3708.098s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3710.479s">Tamar</a>  brings up some very interesting points. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3713.239s">We</a>  all received an email with a letter that was written to the mayor dated January 20, 2015, and I think your concerns about our library falling through the cracks and not being part of <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3729.021s">the</a>  Minuteman network because we are not meeting the required funding levels of valid concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3737.008s">And</a>  I would ask that we take a vote here tonight, Mr. President, over the next several weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3742.116s">We're</a>  going to have pre-budget hearings with all the different department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3747.259s">And</a>  Brian Boutelier, who is the department head for the library, we'll be meeting with shortly. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3753.302s">And</a>  I think it's only appropriate that we ask him the question whether or not Method is in risk of losing its certification with the Mass Board of Library Commissioners. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3763.388s">And</a>  if so, a similar amount is needed for appropriation to make sure that we provide the same funds <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3772.102s">that</a>  is needed to keep us within the Minuteman network and allowing Medford cardholders. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3779.106s">This</a>  is something that you mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3780.807s">If</a>  you're a Medford cardholder now, you can go anywhere in the Minuteman network to that library and pull out a book or pull out a video and utilize the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3789.813s">Without</a>  this particular certification, Medford residents can no longer have that access. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3796.477s">And</a>  to me that's a very important issue <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3798.768s">that</a>  needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3799.848s">So</a>  if we could put that in the form of a resolution asking the director, Mr. Buddha, Leah, uh, if we are in jeopardy, what the dollar amount would need to be to bring us up to, uh, the, uh, levels that the city needs to be at to be part of, uh, the network for minute men. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3816.594s">And</a>  also if we can approach the issue of, uh, the lack of, as which was mentioned, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3822.863s">personnel</a>  of the library, one the children's position and the other one the reference librarian, which we're down right now at the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3832.552s">It</a>  was mentioned the other night that potential use of the public library, not just at its current capacity, but also potentially building a second floor in the library <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3844.78s">to</a>  have community gathering space, to have an art area. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3849.503s">It</a>  could be used for a host of issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3851.905s">So</a>  I see a rosy vision in the future for our library, and we have to maintain the funding and make sure that it doesn't get to a point where people no longer want to go to the library because of the periodics and the equipment is outdated. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3869.016s">And</a>  we may be getting close to that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3871.978s">So</a>  I would ask that that be put in the form of a motion and voted tonight, uh, that the director present that information when we meet with them in pre-budget meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3880.946s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3882.127s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3882.527s">Councilor</a>  Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3883.388s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3884.709s">Um,</a>  Mr. President can't say much more than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3887.591s">Took</a>  the words right out of my mouth by arrest.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3890.594s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3890.934s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3891.955s">Councilor</a>  Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3893.236s">If</a>  I understand this correctly, I'm speaking with Mr. Baudelaire. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3896.32s">We're</a>  short about $70,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3898.081s">I</a>  think that's the dollar amount we need to get to.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3900.623s">So</a>  if that's the case, and you know, we have a library reimbursements and also at the same time, um, if, if, if, with the argument that has been saying about refurbishing and put information, just if I could, according to the research you did in your letter here, it says that it's about 270,000 below the appropriation requirement for certification. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3924.958s">Now</a>  that's just based on, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3926.772s">what</a>  you provided.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3928.113s">That's</a>  not a hard number. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3930.894s">I</a>  did a little research. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3931.895s">That</a>  was me digging around online. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3933.516s">I</a>  don't know the exact number. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3934.776s">But</a>  there is a percentage of the city budget that is what's supposed to be appropriated for the library.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3940.539s">And</a>  that's what we're going to take a vote on tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3942.08s">So</a>  I just wanted to ask.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3943.481s">The</a>  inclusion of the 70, whatever the amount might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3947.383s">Well,</a>  there's nothing to be voted on tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3948.824s">We</a>  don't have a number to be taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3949.944s">So</a>  we're going to get a report. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3950.725s">We're</a>  going to ask the director. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3953.226s">But</a>  if I remember correctly, I think it's the city's portion of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3956.918s">And</a>  if, in fact, any major development does take place to put that second floor on, as Councilor Marks has alluded to, the $70,000 would be more than enough to be included, or whatever the dollar amount might be, because the purpose of using it for the city and the city's usefulness will far exceed, you know, the dollar amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3973.052s">The</a>  dollar amount will be included because that's the work that'll have to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3976.554s">So</a>  I support it, but I just, see, that's the unfortunate part. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3980.358s">Whatever</a>  the number might be, you need to have the exact number. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3983.62s">And</a>  that just goes to show you, once again, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3986.233s">The</a>  city council asked, we've asked each and every year that when a budget is presented to us, we get the information ahead of time or we sit down with department heads and ask them for what their wish list is as to why. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=3999.318s">And</a>  then the other day, most recently the mayor's publicist who works up at the high school as a teacher sends out a press release that said the city council school committee have been hearing from department heads over the past several weeks in a series of pre-budget meetings <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4013.753s">The</a>  entire budget will be before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4015.854s">We've</a>  never met with the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4017.455s">We</a>  haven't even met with a department head. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4020.016s">And</a>  this is what you get when you have an administration that is so out of control as his own personal publicist was a teacher up at the high school with her own private newspaper writing stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4031.24s">And</a>  when people read that, that's what's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4033.441s">This</a>  is wrong information. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4035.042s">We</a>  haven't met with anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4036.242s">We</a>  haven't even met amongst ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4038.303s">We</a>  just got the numbers tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4040.524s">So</a>  how can you put in a newspaper article, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4042.994s">that</a>  we've been meeting for weeks with the school committee and with department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4046.556s">I</a>  wish that were the case, but it's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4049.138s">And</a>  that's why this city gets itself in trouble, a huge lack of communication and miscommunication. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4055.081s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4055.761s">Thank</a>  you, councillor.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4056.682s">Councilor</a>  Karafiello. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4058.283s">Thank</a>  you Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4059.684s">If</a>  I could amend councillor Mark's paper to ask the question to librarian Brian Boulier, which I've asked him the last two budgets, I'd like to see his five year plan for the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4071.47s">Just</a>  can't, we're just, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4073.308s">Again,</a>  I want to know where the library is going. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4075.589s">We're</a>  not going in. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4076.77s">We're</a>  just standing still. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4078.411s">Where</a>  is the, where is his plan to show us where the library is going or where, where his vision of where the library is going? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4084.934s">They</a>  say, yes, that last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4086.375s">They</a>  say, I'd like to make it part of council. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4088.596s">Mark's</a>  paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4089.157s">If</a>  he doesn't mind.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4090.998s">Sorry,</a>  president council. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4092.558s">Um,</a>  it may be appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4095.16s">It</a>  may not be appropriate to bring it up at this point, but we received the budget this evening with a $5 million increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4101.608s">$5</a>  million increase from the previous year's budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4105.17s">Obviously,</a>  Tamar said that the additional money needed for the accreditation is not included in that line item. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4112.814s">But</a>  more importantly, the city council has been asking for months now for the transfers of all the transfers of municipal funds in to and from accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4124.801s">And</a>  we have not received that yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4127.085s">How</a>  do we look at the budget realistically if we don't know how much money was transferred to and from line items that they're being presented to us in the next month and a half? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4137.267s">It</a>  doesn't make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4139.348s">And</a>  then at the end of the year, we're going to get another slew of transfers to balance this year's budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4144.969s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4147.029s">I'm</a>  surprised we haven't had them already. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4148.75s">We</a>  got a paper tonight from Ann Baker answering us the projected revenues <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4155.661s">And</a>  that was the B paper to my original transfer paper request. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4160.824s">So</a>  they answered the B paper because they wanted to, but the transfer paper that was the original paper that was brought up that that amendment was put on. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4170.368s">We</a>  have a beautiful report tonight on the amendment, but the amendment doesn't tell us a picture on how much money is being transferred to and from accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4180.513s">This</a>  is simple for the regular person viewing at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4184.362s">If</a>  you have a checking account, a savings account, and another checking account, and you transfer the money in between accounts by doing online banking, unless you actually look where the money came from, where it's going, and for what intent it's spended for, you're not going to know the actual balances. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4205.535s">And</a>  it's the budget we got tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4208.097s">Without</a>  the transfers, take the fiscal year budget we're in and throw it out the window. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4212.239s">Throw</a>  it out the window. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4214.312s">We</a>  know what's been encumbered, what's projected to be spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4217.556s">But</a>  other than that, and we know there are accounts that are in the arrears right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4223.282s">I</a>  don't know exactly which ones, but I'm assuming it's overtime accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4227.006s">I'm</a>  assuming it's other accounts out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4229.629s">And</a>  unless we have a full accounting of all the transfers, it's unrealistic budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4237.218s">And</a>  as I talked about a few weeks ago, we have $6 million, $6 million plus in certified free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4243.163s">It's</a>  certified because we didn't expend that money that was raised in previous fiscal years. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4252.87s">And</a>  the DOR certified us to go ahead and put it in certified free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4259.294s">So</a>  that $6 million that was appropriated on the backs of the taxpayers for several years, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4266.611s">to</a>  get a savings, to put the city in a financially good spot for debt consolidation and other wonderful things that have happened over the past few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4278.117s">But</a>  the transfer paper is a very, very important piece of my moving forward in either supporting or not supporting a budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4288.09s">You</a>  know, and this budget's going to be very, very interesting in particular, too, because with a new administration, we don't know, this is where we can craft where we think the city should be going. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4299.6s">OCD,</a>  I think, should be boosted up. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4303.063s">We</a>  have to give the new administration the tools to do their vision. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4310.429s">They</a>  may say that certain officers don't need X amount of people, and other areas need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4316.783s">We</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4317.604s">We</a>  don't know who's going to be in that corner office. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4319.825s">But</a>  the fact of the matter is, Mr. President, I think we need to have those transfers. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4325.068s">I</a>  think the transfers tell us exactly how much money of — and I want to say this the correct way — how much money that was put aside for a specific purpose at the end of June last year was actually spent on that specific purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4344.799s">And</a>  just for the viewing public, too, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4346.969s">The</a>  city council has to make transfers, and according to Massachusetts finance law, the only time the city council has to make the transfers, if it's from one account that's totally different from another account, if it's from the police to the fire, or from information technology to the city clerk, interdepartmental transfers. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4369.515s">We</a>  don't have any control or any say, and nor does the administration need any vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4376.583s">regarding</a>  transfers internally. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4378.304s">So</a>  they could put money in an account that's called water cooler for $5,000 say, and they can take that out and use it for something else without the city council needing to approve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4388.311s">So</a>  I hopefully that gives a good picture to people out there on how the budget actually works, where the certified free cash that we all talk about comes from, and more importantly, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4400.41s">the</a>  budget that we pass, if it indeed is being spent in the areas where we put our stamp of approval on by a majority vote of the duly elected members of the Medford City Council year after year after year. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4412.821s">So</a>  I would say, Mr. President, that I think you have to send the message to the city administration that without that paper, don't even bother showing up to a budget hearing, honestly, because we've been asking for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4424.711s">And</a>  to get the B paper answered, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4427.082s">and</a>  not the original paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4428.702s">It's,</a>  it's kind of humorous.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4430.783s">It's</a>  insulting and insulting. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4433.303s">You</a>  said it, not me. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4434.904s">Councilor</a>  on the motion of Councilor Marks for approval.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4486.361s">And</a>  now, Mr. President, one last question. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4489.962s">I</a>  know it comes up during budget hearing, but Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4491.783s">Siegel</a>  this evening as well referenced it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4494.945s">If</a>  we also could see where the status is, if any, of the waiver going forward as well, because we don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4503.189s">I</a>  know in the past years we've had one after the waiver, but is that the intention this year to go after the waiver again? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=4509.912s">But</a>  I think that's part of the question that should be answered.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5125.646s">I</a>  find the papers in order, Mr. President, and move approval.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5171.823s">Mr.</a>  President, Mr. Councilor, why we're under suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5174.745s">Can</a>  we take 15-four, five, six. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5176.987s">I</a>  know there's some, um, viewers at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5179.535s">in</a>  the Grove Street area on the mausoleum?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5183.318s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Camuso to take paper out of order, 15456, offered by Councilor Penta, be it resolved that since some time ago the Council had discussions regarding a public mausoleum, the subject needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5199.07s">Councilor</a>  Penta.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5200.331s">Mr.</a>  President, I think on April 8th we received a document from the Cemetery Board of Trustees regarding the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5206.662s">And</a>  inclusive of that meeting, there was a notation from Louise Miller that indicated that a bid for construction for a public mausoleum at Oak Grove Cemetery had three responders. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5218.489s">Medford</a>  City Council for years has been talking about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5221.931s">And</a>  I just really feel to some degree, once again, it's the administration just ignoring the council, keeping us not only out of the loop, but completely unaware of what's going on in the loop. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5231.537s">And</a>  the fact of the matter is, now that you're down to three bidders and evaluating these firms, I think the council wanted to have a discussion on mausoleums, where they would be in the cemetery, having an open public forum for people to come and then also meet with the Board of Cemetery Trustees about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5249.902s">This</a>  seems like it's almost like it's a done deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5252.643s">I</a>  mean, nobody has any idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5254.063s">I</a>  mean, people, when I go to the cemetery, ask me where the mausoleum is. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5257.544s">And</a>  I say, what mausoleum? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5258.384s">I</a>  don't know anything about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5260.565s">And</a>  that's what started this whole thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5261.886s">And</a>  then when I went back through my papers and I saw this thing, which is dated April 8, I just think, you know, there was something wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5271.27s">I</a>  mean, why is this council not being told on issues which generated from them? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5277.734s">This</a>  isn't even something that we have never even talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5280.475s">This</a>  has been on here for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5282.676s">We've</a>  asked, and it was going to be considered. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5285.238s">And</a>  then we were going to get total that would be brought back to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5288.311s">We</a>  have our discussions every time during our budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5291.793s">And</a>  now we have the trustees will now read the proposals, evaluate them, and rank them, and then a follow-up meeting will be discussed, which is in May. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5299.656s">I</a>  would like to have, Mr. President, I'd like to move that the Board of Trustees meet with the Medford City Council for the purposes of discussing the mausoleums that are being suggested for Oak Grove Cemetery.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5312.324s">That's</a>  a fine motion, Councilor, but the Board of Trustees is the governing authority of the cemetery.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5318.168s">I</a>  don't really care who's the governing. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5319.73s">I</a>  just think the City Council, where this was all initiated from, deserves at least some kind of respect in return to saying, as a follow-up, it's quite similar to what Councilor Camuso just talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5331.859s">The</a>  answer is B paper before the A paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5334.34s">Well,</a>  we talk about the mausoleums and the city goes ahead and do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5338.043s">They</a>  have bids that go out and they have proposals to come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5341.002s">That's</a>  not to say there's anything wrong with it, but where is it going to be? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5343.783s">What</a>  part of the cemetery? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5345.224s">You</a>  know, we are an integral part of this community, and we do fund the cemetery through our budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5351.967s">So</a>  I think there is a duty of respect that's owed to the council.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5356.329s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5357.149s">I</a>  discussed the matter with John Morgan some 27 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5362.052s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5363.772s">Mr.</a>  President, I do believe that the Board of Cemetery Trustees will be meeting on June 2nd at 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5368.414s">to</a>  discuss this very issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5370.017s">Now,</a>  I certainly have no problem meeting with the trustees of the cemetery. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5373.16s">However,</a>  I think that if we are, in fact, going to have a productive session, that this meeting should wait until after the June 2nd meeting that the cemetery trustees have with the Director of Purchasing slash Budget Director to go over the RFPs and the RFQs. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5385.189s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I have no problem having a meeting with the Board of Trustees, but I want this meeting to take place after they have their regular deliberations on the June 2nd meeting.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5393.997s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5394.937s">Councilor</a>  Camuso.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5396.608s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5398.328s">And</a>  I believe, first of all, this was initiated by Councilor Marks about four or five years ago? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5406.61s">Four</a>  years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5408.25s">And</a>  it was on the end of the agenda ever since. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5411.07s">And</a>  just till recently, I believe we received the request for the $30,000 for the feasibility study from the city administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5419.012s">With</a>  that being said, I think we really got to get a good understanding, too, on how the mausoleums actually work. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5427.105s">Councilor</a>  Penta brought up a very valid point. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5429.105s">Where</a>  exactly is it going to be? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5431.266s">The</a>  second piece of the puzzle is, I'm not quite sure if public cemeteries are in the business normally of managing a mausoleum. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5442.228s">I</a>  know a lot of the private cemeteries, it seems, has them more than, is that fair to say, Councilor, based upon your professional? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5448.93s">Okay,</a>  so that is true, that it's the private <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5453.838s">cemeteries</a>  that seem to have Management of these a lot more than the other thing is to I want to get an idea how much it's gonna cost for a Medford family Some of the numbers that you hear are pretty significant For this so I just think we should have a meeting and I agree with councillor Penta just to find out Where we're going with this as a whole as councillor night did say though the and I agree with him. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5480.449s">This</a>  is strictly a <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5482.312s">under</a>  the jurisdiction of the Cemetery Board of Trustees. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5486.254s">Unless</a>  they're looking for bonding through the City Council, that is where our official action would be needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5493.677s">But</a>  I'm glad we're talking about it.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5498.059s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5499.04s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Penta, Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5504.182s">I</a>  want to thank Councilor Penta for bringing this up tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5507.003s">And</a>  it was a resolution offered by myself a few years back. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5511.957s">And</a>  at the time, it was in direct relationship to the board, the cemetery board, stating that within a matter of 15 to 20 years that there were going to be no more burials because of a lack of burial space at the cemetery. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5529.341s">And</a>  one way of rejuvenating and allowing for residents for the next 35 to 40 years to be buried right within their hometown was to <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5541.886s">look</a>  at limited space and the use of a mausoleum. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5546.509s">And</a>  potentially maybe several mausoleums, depending on the size and the nature and the proximity and the cemetery that they'll be located. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5555.495s">But</a>  this is a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5557.296s">I'm</a>  on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5558.297s">I</a>  agree with my council colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5560.579s">I</a>  think they should do their own deliberation, their own due diligence. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5564.861s">But</a>  I also believe, as Councilor Penta mentioned, that we should have some input and some say <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5570.752s">on</a>  behalf of the residents of this community on what takes place within that community. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5575.997s">I</a>  realize they're an autonomous board, and they make their own decisions, but we're here as a legislative body, and I think it would be prudent to have the entire community, as well as this body, involved in the process.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5593.351s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5594.152s">So</a>  on that motion, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5597.254s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5598.315s">Motion</a>  carries. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5601.558s">Report</a>  back to the regular order of business, 15-452 offered by Council Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5607.26s">Be</a>  it resolved that a public ascertainment hearing for Comcast held last week be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5617.303s">Council</a>  Penta.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5619.044s">Mr.</a>  President, last Thursday at 2 o'clock in the afternoon in this council chamber, an ascertainment hearing took place and it's related to the Comcast contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5629.773s">that</a>  I believed everybody in the room that day, except the gentleman, Mr. Epstein, who was sitting up conducting the hearing, knew that the hearing or the date of April 18th, which was the ending date of the city's contract with Comcast, had been extended to July. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5645.917s">Now,</a>  unbeknownst to all of us until we were speaking at the podium on that day, oh, let me preface this by saying there wasn't one person. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5652.259s">There</a>  wasn't one person here from the city administration to speak on the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5657.007s">to</a>  defend it, to defend the taxpayers, the ratepayers within this community, to the concerns that they might have as it relates to all of these particular issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5664.874s">And</a>  as a result of that, there was seven or eight citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5667.936s">Some</a>  spoke. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5668.557s">Some</a>  didn't speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5669.317s">I</a>  think six of them did speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5671.059s">And</a>  a lot of the major concerns were as follows. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5673.961s">But</a>  I just want to, you know, there was a certified mail sent by the mayor of this community on April 16th, two days before, two days before, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5683.99s">the</a>  deadline, which was April 18. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5685.93s">And</a>  according to the federal law, which supersedes state law, this continuance takes place until July 3 of this year coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5694.472s">So</a>  residents who have any concerns as it relates to Comcast, the renewal of the cable contract, have up until May 21 to submit their formal complaints to the mayor of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5705.475s">And</a>  they will be officially forwarded to the State Cable Commission in Boston and to Mr. Peter Epstein <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5712.458s">who</a>  is the paid legal consultant for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5716.861s">But</a>  some of the comments that were made, number one, the 10-year contract, way, way, way too long. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5722.405s">Another</a>  part of the comments were the issuing authority taking it out of the mayor's hands and putting it into the legislative body, like it is in some other cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5730.651s">There's</a>  no senior citizen discount. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5732.773s">The</a>  increase in cost just keeps going up each and every year as it relates to Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5737.296s">And</a>  with the new addition, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5739.008s">of</a>  the technology that's out there between Amazon and Apple and a whole host of other individuals in this business, a 10-year contract would serve no purpose for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5750.698s">A</a>  three to a five-year contract seems to be something that would be palatable and it would be something that could possibly be written that could find itself with renewable terminology. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5759.825s">Also,</a>  there was no explanation because it never took place of any survey that ever took place here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5768.935s">with</a>  Comcast customers over the past 10 years, whether they were satisfied, dissatisfied, or what they would like to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5775.617s">Also,</a>  there was no mention of the fact that the mass cable division indicates that ascertainment hearings need to take place within 12 months prior to the expiration date, but no later than six months prior to. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5791.202s">We</a>  never had that within 12 months, and we never had that within six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5795.583s">That's</a>  not from me. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5796.364s">That's</a>  from the cable division form <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5798.302s">100</a>  and that's part of their proceeding operating procedures Also, we have the discussion on the particular perks are in kind benefits that this mayor has received as a result of having this contract with Comcast what was indicated at that meeting there were 52 cities and towns throughout the country or 52 mares for which we were one of them that wrote a letter in support of having a merger between Time Warner and Comcast <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5825.88s">The</a>  mayor was quoted in picture form in the magazines that proffer the cable industry as being a shill for Comcast, because number one, he received on an annual basis $2,500 for his annual golf tournament, and he got $10,000 a year for his celebrations committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5848.618s">That</a>  in and of itself <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5849.992s">was</a>  a concern because no one else, no rate payer has that opportunity to get that for whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5856.634s">Also,</a>  there needed to be a complete review of the records of the public access corporation, minutes of the meeting, financial records, bank accounts, and all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5867.258s">That</a>  has never taken place. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5868.899s">Comcast</a>  themselves have never taken the opportunity to review it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5872.62s">They've</a>  never taken an inventory of the PEG facilities, and they haven't looked at the lifespan of the equipment that they have at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5879.135s">And</a>  there was no strategic plan to be presented for the PEG programming as a result of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5884.8s">And</a>  the access corporation, in and of itself, needs to be in good standing by having its annual reports and its financial filings and its proper forms in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, for which they don't have. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5896.309s">These</a>  are all things that Comcast has not done as it relates to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5900.192s">Comcast</a>  has not had any public hearings themselves to encourage commentary from people, from the citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5906.858s">It</a>  was brought up at that meeting that the city council voted on two separate occasions. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5911.18s">One,</a>  to have the public hearing and two, to have the public hearing at a reasonable time, which would have been two o'clock in the afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5918.984s">What</a>  the mayor decided to do was to have, he canceled out the first meeting on a Thursday and forwarded to the next Thursday meeting, which was last week, and still had it at two o'clock in the afternoon because there was hardly anybody here. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5931.731s">People</a>  were working. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5932.793s">And</a>  some people who were here, including myself, felt that that was a slight. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5936.415s">And</a>  it was a slight. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5937.135s">It</a>  was slight to the rate payers within this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5939.576s">There</a>  was nothing by way of a document that would indicate that a survey was taken by Comcast for the purposes of ascertaining community needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5949.0s">And</a>  the results of the survey were not included or submitted to the issuing authority in this particular case was the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5956.931s">Usually</a>  the way it will go, the town usually sends out an RFP, or in this particular case, if we're talking about a renewal to the contract, then that renewal to the contract generally takes about 30 to 90 days for the issuing authority to review it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5971.155s">And</a>  then four months after the issuing authority reviews it, the proposal from the cable contractor or the operator at that point in time can once again be received. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5982.098s">The</a>  city does not have to accept it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5983.678s">The</a>  city can send it back. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5984.779s">The</a>  city can reject it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5986.223s">or</a>  they can consider the contract in a shorter term of period and time. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=5991.104s">The</a>  new legislative landscape on this particular negotiation on long-term contracts has now been considered to be anywhere from three to five to seven years. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6000.986s">I</a>  think that would be something that could be palatable if the terminology was written in there that, inclusive of that language, there would be a review done by Comcast for the things that we talked about that they haven't been doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6015.28s">The</a>  commercial districts were brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6016.92s">Councilor</a>  Marks' indication relative the lack of connectivity to certain parts of the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6022.382s">That</a>  was brought up, that was a point brought up I believe by two other individuals as well as myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6027.064s">That</a>  in and of itself really showed that Comcast has not gone out of its way for the purposes of connectivity. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6032.885s">Again,</a>  it's another failing on their part to make sure that the city was completely and totally hooked up for Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6040.508s">They</a>  indicated also too, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6042.583s">that</a>  the reducing of INET expenses or negotiating for cable modem installations, which is more and the least costly, could be challenged by the 6 megahertz channels, which are high-definition channels to the cable operator. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6058.668s">There</a>  was also the request that we could avoid agreeing with the cable operator's right to reclaim unused channel time. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6065.91s">That's</a>  one thing I believe that Comcast has done through the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6069.471s">If</a>  a cable channel is not being used, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6072.385s">They've</a>  reclaimed it, and they've put it into a higher tier. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6075.427s">Those</a>  are some of the issues in an overview that took place in that particular meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6080.51s">Once</a>  again, if anybody — oh, yeah, strike that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6084.572s">And</a>  also, lastly, performance review hearings, a request to hold hearings on an annual or as-needed basis, contractually obligate the cable operator's attendance. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6094.503s">That</a>  has never been done by Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6097.565s">So</a>  these were the things, these were the nuts and bolts, these were the ingredients that were talked about and presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6102.628s">There</a>  was a stenography here, and I don't know if I'm gonna wait to make sure that you recorded everything, because I will be submitting a copy of what I just got through talking about, but anyone who might be watching who has a displeasure or a pleasure, whether you like them or don't like them, you can write to the mayor of the city as the issuing authority, and tell them what you think on or before May 24th, because that will then be submitted, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6124.803s">to</a>  the Mass Cable Regulatory Agency. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6127.284s">And</a>  then at that point in time, I believe the city will then go into the process of negotiating. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6133.726s">Another</a>  part of the comment that was made to Mr. Epstein was the fact that since the mayor will no longer be the mayor, that we ask that no contract become operative and effective until next year after a new mayor has been selected to give that person the opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6147.612s">Gave</a>  the example of the same situation taking place right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6151.357s">where</a>  the Director of Public Works, when they went through the whole process, they're now not hiring a Director of Public Works. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6156.438s">They're</a>  waiting for the new mayor to come on board so that mayor can do the hiring of the Public Works. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6161.039s">With</a>  that being said, Mr. President, I believe that's somewhat of a general overview of what took place at the hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6168.38s">And</a>  once again, I just think it was an out and out shame that the mayor refused to have that hearing at nighttime to give many citizens an opportunity to come and speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6176.918s">and</a>  to relate their concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6178.759s">You</a>  know, if you're going out of office and you really want to leave the ship, why would you want to do that to the taxpayers of this community? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6185.161s">I</a>  don't know why, but unfortunately he did. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6187.682s">But</a>  at least some of us had an opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6189.903s">And</a>  I will leave by saying the following, not one person who represents this city, administration or otherwise, came to that meeting to express their concerns, complaints, compliments, or what have you, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6202.801s">in</a>  behalf of the cable TV subscribers, and that was a damn shame. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6206.482s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6209.103s">I</a>  was there, yes.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6211.223s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Pentich to receive in place on file?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6214.224s">No,</a>  no. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6215.004s">The</a>  motion is going to be to have anybody who has a concern as it relates to Comcast, whether they're for it or against it, for or against the 10-year contract, to write their concerns to the issuing authority as it presently stands, which is the mayor, for the purposes of having them duly recorded before any contract is signed.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6232.663s">The</a>  clerk has that before any contract is signed.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6237.625s">Or</a>  negotiated for.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6239.305s">Or</a>  negotiated for. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6241.666s">On</a>  that motion, Councilor Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6243.846s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6244.147s">I</a>  want to thank Councilor Penta for being the only council to be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6247.608s">I</a>  had intended to be there last week, but I'm on another committee that I had to be in Boston for another meeting with something else. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6252.989s">And</a>  it's a shame that when Councilor Penta told me, nobody from the city showed up to represent us there other than Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6262.026s">Nobody</a>  from the office. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6264.727s">I</a>  thought it was just unheard of that no one, not even a token person, showed up. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6270.631s">It's</a>  a shame, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6272.271s">It's</a>  a shame.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6273.212s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6277.454s">Welcome,</a>  sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6278.135s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Joe Viglione]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6280.376s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6282.137s">Joe</a>  Villione, 59 Garfield Ave, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6286.359s">I</a>  want to thank Councilor Penta and Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6289.08s">His</a>  heart was in the right place. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6290.781s">Councilor</a>  Penta did show up. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6292.917s">As</a>  Councilor Camuso just noted, and it's true, we had one representative from the city and I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6300.802s">We</a>  need a second hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6302.023s">We</a>  really do because I went door to door prior to the hearing in Haines Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6306.026s">Businesses</a>  did not know, people did not know. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6309.768s">Woman</a>  at one of the banks was like, I want to be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6312.45s">They</a>  didn't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6313.611s">And</a>  Comcast is a big issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6314.932s">It's</a>  not about public access per se. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6317.373s">It's</a>  about the whole thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6319.541s">As</a>  you may know, Verizon paid $4.4 billion for AOL. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6324.404s">This</a>  went down yesterday, today. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6325.745s">AOL</a>  was part of Time Warner. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6328.707s">Comcast</a>  was part of Time Warner. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6329.948s">Now,</a>  you know, they're all trading secrets. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6331.769s">They</a>  all know what each other is doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6334.451s">It's</a>  a whole new world, and 10 years is just not appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6337.252s">So</a>  we need a second hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6339.014s">Now,</a>  people out there, after the hearing, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6342.141s">Our</a>  sports host, Johnny Byers, and myself went over to Mary Morell's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6345.503s">She's</a>  such a good person. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6347.945s">And</a>  we submitted the letters, which Mr. Epstein took, and City Hall time stamped them. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6354.269s">So</a>  it's just making sure that they got the letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6357.991s">You</a>  can bring letters to City Hall, either to Linda Colletti's office or Mary Morell's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6363.695s">Please,</a>  people, write your letters about Comcast, good or bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6369.858s">Note</a>  to the mayor that we want a public access station. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6372.02s">It's</a>  very important the citizens of this community get a little proactive. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6375.662s">Everyone</a>  in this room, just write a letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6377.503s">You</a>  don't have to be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6378.784s">But</a>  we need a second hearing, and I thank the city council for your vote, 7-0, to have it at 6-30. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6385.308s">What's</a>  the problem with giving the people some time to talk to Comcast? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6392.192s">Tim</a>  Kelly was sitting here. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6393.813s">I</a>  spoke to him after the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6398.018s">the</a>  fellow from Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6399.258s">It's</a>  just very important for the citizens to know the landscape. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6402.559s">They</a>  want a 10-year deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6403.679s">They've</a>  got to get to know us. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6405.58s">So</a>  Comcast, shame on them for not demanding the mayor have it at 6.30 because other towns in this Commonwealth had the meeting at an appropriate hour, 7 o'clock, 6.30. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6417.403s">I</a>  don't know why that didn't happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6422.444s">The</a>  equipment, equipment for TV 3, where is it?

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6565.282s">On</a>  or before May 21st and before any contract negotiations.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6570.964s">Negotiations.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6572.005s">A</a>  contract be signed. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6573.145s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6574.486s">And</a>  attached to that were the three motions. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6576.947s">Right,</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6577.247s">That</a>  were submitted before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6578.948s">They</a>  were all related to the matter of Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6584.427s">Last</a>  week's motion was that we all voted on the past 7-0, I believe, was that the mayor not enter into a new contract until, not enter a contract, a tenure contract with Comcast, until a new mayor is selected and sworn in. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6599.93s">And</a>  now this resolution is?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6601.83s">Well,</a>  the reason why the resolution is coming up now, because the extension that, um, the extension that Mr., um, that the mayor sent out on April 16th, he sent this by certified mail and facsimile. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6614.11s">and</a>  this is an addendum to that for which it took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6618.132s">And</a>  as Mr. Kelly said, any and all information, they welcome it because this is what they have to negotiate on.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6625.116s">On</a>  the motion for approval by Councilor Penta, roll call has been requested.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6629.638s">Can</a>  you just explain to me how the A portion is to provide the information to the mayor's office, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6635.281s">The</a>  B portion of the paper, can you read that back just one more time, please?</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6639.683s">The</a>  B portion is the pre-resolution</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6643.221s">15.306,</a>  15. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6643.421s">No,</a>  no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6644.863s">You</a>  said the first part was that all the citizens send their emails and everything else to the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6650.307s">Pro</a>  concern, yeah, to the mayor and at the mayor.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6655.432s">He</a>  has to forward them. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6655.992s">Not</a>  negotiate or enter in the contract before these papers are received for May 21st hearing, is that it?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6663.258s">No,</a>  he can't do that anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6664.759s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6665.14s">The</a>  thing is, all papers for or against have to be submitted to the mayor on or before <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6670.782s">May</a>  21st, that's the deadline for filing, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6673.865s">This</a>  contract goes to July 3rd. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6676.048s">Subsequent</a>  to May 21st and after July 3rd, that's when the mayor, who are, if he so chooses, to go forward and negotiate a contract, this is all the information we want included. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6686.459s">This</a>  is what Mr. Kelly said. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6687.96s">As</a>  much as you give them and send forth between now and then, they have to consider that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6692.79s">So</a>  we're adding July date to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6696.372s">July</a>  3rd is the extension date.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6699.754s">I</a>  have no problem with providing the information, Mr. President, or giving the residents a problem to provide the information. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6706.317s">However,</a>  I haven't moved off my position that I don't think that we should enter into a new 10 year contract as we voted on last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6712.941s">So</a>  with that being said, you know, maybe we let the resolution stand from last week because they're contradictory at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6718.724s">They</a>  are.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6720.245s">That's</a>  your opinion.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6721.512s">Well,</a>  one of them says for the mayor not to enter into a contract, and the other one says to let the mayor enter into a contract, so.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6726.115s">No,</a>  we're not letting him enter into a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6727.656s">What</a>  you're doing is you have to read the law, and the law is very specific as it relates to this particular contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6733.2s">He</a>  has now signed the extension. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6734.6s">By</a>  having the extension signed and having the ascertainment hearing after the fact, not before the fact, that has presented multiple of issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6743.146s">Before,</a>  you or I or nobody had any opportunity <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6746.581s">to</a>  explain or express ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6749.122s">Now,</a>  since they had the ascertainment hearing, even though it's after the fact, this all has to be taken in consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6754.724s">So</a>  if you don't want to vote for it, vote.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6756.024s">I'll</a>  vote for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6756.384s">No,</a>  I'm saying that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6756.964s">Let</a>  it be taken into consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6758.185s">But</a>  has this council moved off its position that they don't want the mayor?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6760.645s">Well,</a>  maybe they're reaffirming its position because nobody came here. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6764.266s">So</a>  at least we want to reaffirm. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6765.867s">You</a>  don't want to vote for it? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6766.527s">You</a>  don't have to vote for it.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6767.648s">I</a>  just want to be clear as to what we're voting for. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6769.228s">Well,</a>  I'm just reaffirming my position. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6770.969s">I</a>  don't want to vote for four separate resolutions that are all contradictory to each other <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6776.005s">direct</a>  contradiction to the rules that we have where we disposed of an item that's substantially similar.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6780.366s">It's</a>  not being disposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6781.427s">What</a>  you're doing is you're amending the original one and it's an entirely different resolution.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6787.609s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6791.01s">Councilor</a>  Camuso.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6792.61s">Um,</a>  we're still waiting on an opinion from the city solicitor that we asked for probably several months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6798.852s">This</a>  whole thing could be moot if the Medford city council injects, um, a recension of the original vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6806.211s">that</a>  was taken way back when. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6809.152s">We</a>  asked for a ruling, whether it was a new contract or an extension of the contract, or if it was by home rule petition, or if it was by a separate law. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6822.394s">And</a>  I believe we're still waiting for that opinion from the solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6825.655s">He's</a>  been very busy providing us other opinions. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6828.315s">But</a>  that one, I think, should be put to the front of the list, where this is something that's ongoing right now.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6837.487s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Penta for approval, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6846.369s">Motion</a>  to sever by council and night. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6849.01s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6849.33s">So</a>  we're severing the comment section.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6851.571s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6856.492s">So</a>  we're calling the role on the, well, did the chair rule that this is contradictory to the vote last week? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6864.354s">You</a>  did say that you agreed. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6868.618s">I'm</a>  just asking a question of the chair, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6875.139s">It's</a>  not reaffirming. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6876.139s">It's</a>  changing.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6876.679s">But</a>  then we've disposed of it already.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6889.122s">Very</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6890.902s">The</a>  extension was signed on April 15, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6895.723s">Yeah,</a>  the ascertainment hearing was May</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6900.346s">So</a>  the vote on the comment section first.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6913.652s">Please</a>  call the roll, Mr. Clerk.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6915.613s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6917.433s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6918.814s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6925.657s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6926.497s">The</a>  vote of six in the affirmative, one absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6929.526s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6931.908s">The</a>  second vote is on. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6939.552s">Reaffirming</a>  the three prior resolutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6943.835s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6950.279s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6951.94s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6958.437s">based</a>  on the issue of redundancy. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6960.899s">Thank</a>  you, so noted.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6972.749s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6973.75s">With</a>  a vote of 4 in the affirmative, 2 in the negative, 1 absent, the motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=6994.976s">15</a>  for 54 offered by Councilor Penta be it resolved that the mayor and city engineers failure to respond to council resolution regarding the EPA proposed Ms for permitting be reviewed for passage. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7009.64s">Councilor</a>  Penta.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7012.0s">Um,</a>  15 Oh 83 was, it was, was presented before the city council some two months ago and the unfortunate part about it, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7024.282s">as</a>  we're starting to go through all these resolutions that are not being responded to. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7027.603s">I</a>  don't know why either the mayor or the city engineer has refused to do this, refused to respond to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7035.065s">85</a>  cities and towns have now signed on to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7038.546s">Today</a>  I attended a mass municipal board meeting and one of their highlights is this MS for permitting part of this permitting process that the EPA is forthcoming. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7052.246s">As</a>  a matter of fact, today it was recognized for the first time that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is complementing cities and towns who are taking a stand on this particular position and challenging the EPA, the federal EPA, on this particular mandate, which is not only going to be costly, it's going to be almost prohibitive for the city and town to do this within the next five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7073.133s">It's</a>  an excess of 13, I believe, over $20 billion <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7078.968s">entity</a>  as it's going to relate upon the entire Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7083.569s">This</a>  is nothing more than having our city engineer write a letter in support of our community, sister communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7091.61s">She</a>  doesn't believe what I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7093.471s">We're</a>  a member of MMA. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7094.651s">She</a>  can call them up and ask them, you know, what it's all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7097.792s">She</a>  can check in with their environmental committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7100.352s">You</a>  know, all we're doing is requesting the APA that since the proposed MS4 stormwater <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7106.213s">sewer</a>  system permit would require communities to institute more advanced stormwater testing, monitoring, and management programs, but is completely silent on funding or mitigation of the additional costs to communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7119.143s">And</a>  since there is no flexibility in the compliance portion of the requirements, and since communities are grappling with these huge financial challenges, with preliminary projections to be in excess of $800,000 per year per community, we ask the EPA to defer action on their submission <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7136.437s">of</a>  a notice of intent until municipalities have had the opportunity to engage the regulatory agencies in an open dialogue regarding these onerous and unaffordable permit requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7147.743s">And</a>  then it goes on and explains and it gives a whole list of these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7151.205s">And</a>  I just don't understand why we have not received. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7153.927s">I</a>  think it was Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7155.228s">I</a>  think in the beginning you sort of like okayed with that and you said, can we just send it upstairs and let's see if we can get an answer back. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7161.291s">Well,</a>  we haven't gotten an answer back from her. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7163.86s">And</a>  this is too important of an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7165.661s">They</a>  did a survey of Massachusetts cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7168.303s">This</a>  was their second highest priority through Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7172.566s">Municipal</a>  Association, for which we are a paid dues member within that community. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7178.75s">This</a>  is huge. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7180.391s">This</a>  is huge as it relates to an infrastructure problem here in the city of Medford, as it relates to our water and sewer, especially our stormwater and sewer provisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7190.157s">This</a>  is a very aggressive attitude. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7192.682s">being</a>  taken by the EPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7195.023s">What</a>  the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is doing, and the Baker administration, and the Commonwealth's EPA program, they're asking for a long-term, at least a minimum, of a 20-year program that forecasts out cities and towns to go at this at a reasonable pace and at a reasonable cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7211.714s">The</a>  city of Medford cannot afford $800,000 a year to correct all its stormwater provisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7216.917s">That's</a>  minimum. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7217.958s">Could</a>  even be more on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7219.859s">We</a>  have things going on upstairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7222.463s">in</a>  our water and sewer department that's going to be costing us probably into the millions with a new program that they're going to be coming up on a leak detection program. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7230.049s">And</a>  then when we look at that, how's the priority run against that against this? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7234.393s">Mr.</a>  President, I'm asking that we as a city or our Medford City Council go forward with a letter of support, forward this to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts EBA and letting them know that we support their proposal <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7249.233s">for</a>  forecasting this over a longer period of time, having an educational program for which there is none being offered by the federal EPA, and at the same time, give cities and towns an opportunity to forecast their financial program to engage in this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7266.503s">Also,</a>  there are five coalitions of eastern Massachusetts towns, which make up over 85 communities that surround us that are looking into combining their services, their expertise, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7277.972s">and</a>  whatever it takes to reduce the individual city and town burden to get through this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7284.036s">So</a>  again, going through all our resolutions that haven't been answered, there's a whole host of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7289.899s">If</a>  this is the mayor's intent to just leave and just ignore this council or have a department head ignore this council on this most important issue, shame on all of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7298.344s">This</a>  is too important an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7300.005s">It</a>  affects every single taxpayer, water and soil projection, water and soil rate payer, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7305.087s">in</a>  this particular community. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7306.349s">So</a>  I ask approval, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7309.111s">And</a>  if you want, I'll read the entire resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7311.614s">No</a>  thanks.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7312.235s">Approval</a>  by Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7314.557s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7316.539s">Is</a>  the text of the resolution the text that the gentleman proposes be included in the letter?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7322.005s">In</a>  the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7323.627s">Yes,</a>  that's the exact text.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7338.067s">on</a>  that motion?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7340.108s">Mr.</a>  President, I certainly can understand the councilor's concern, and I can understand where he's coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7345.252s">And</a>  I think that this is also going to be a very costly, costly endeavor. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7351.055s">However,</a>  I'm reading the language of the letter, and I think that we might be better served coming across as a unanimous body that sits down and drafts a letter to the EPA as a group for something that we can all wholeheartedly support. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7362.742s">Based</a>  on the language that's in the underlying resolution, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7366.109s">I</a>  can't support it, however, I'm more than willing to sit down maybe in committee or in committee of the whole and we can come down and put a draft together, Mr. President, or maybe even go in a step further where there are five stormwater coalitions that have gotten together and that have actually done some work on this together. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7381.833s">Maybe</a>  we have one of them come in and share their expertise with us and help us draft a letter that's going to really hit the points, the high points that we need to hit. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7388.148s">Number</a>  one, and number two, also provide us with a little bit more information as to how a regional stormwater coalition would work and whether or not that's in the best interest of the city of Medford.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7395.652s">And</a>  maybe it would be helpful to have our city engineer as part of that conversation, because there might be something going on about it that we haven't been apprised of for whatever reason.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7406.358s">Mr.</a>  President, with all due respect to the city engineer who's had this for over two months and not being responsive to it, as well as other issues that are sitting up there, I just think, and I don't understand <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7415.339s">If</a>  Councilor Knight has a problem with the words, what's the problem with the words?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7419.0s">I</a>  find them to be somewhat inflammatory. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7420.54s">And</a>  if I got a letter like that sitting on my desk when I was at work, I'd look at the thing and I'd scratch my head and I'd say, who are these nuts that are sending it to me? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7426.941s">You</a>  know, you look at the language in there, and it's very divisive. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7431.442s">It</a>  seems very argumentative. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7432.723s">It</a>  seems very, um.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7434.783s">How</a>  can it be? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7435.463s">Well,</a>  read the language. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7436.383s">You're</a>  just using terminology. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7437.824s">What</a>  words don't you like? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7439.224s">What</a>  sentence don't you like in here?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7441.925s">The</a>  aggressive schedule the EPA poses <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7445.115s">It</a>  is aggressive. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7445.936s">In</a>  absence of EPA leadership.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7450.959s">Right</a>  now, in the federal government, there is an absence of leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7454.681s">There</a>  is nobody there at the helm for the purposes of making this a direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7458.064s">So</a>  this is coming from Washington down. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7460.325s">And</a>  if you talk to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7461.886s">It's</a>  translated into another harmful and unfunded mandate on cities, towns, and taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7465.628s">It</a>  is. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7465.869s">I</a>  just feel as though the tone's argumentative.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7467.47s">I</a>  feel like it starts to soften more. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7468.53s">I've</a>  got to move, Mr. President, move on the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7470.732s">Move</a>  the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7471.953s">I</a>  don't think it's argumentative. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7473.053s">I</a>  think it needs to be done.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7474.781s">On</a>  the motion of Council of Penta for approval, all those in favor.</p>

<a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7731.356s">Safety</a>  first. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7732.416s">That's</a>  the first thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7734.984s">With</a>  that in mind, we waited. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7736.505s">We</a>  wrote more letters. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7737.546s">We</a>  went down. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7738.506s">We</a>  were told at one of the safety meetings that we had to run it by, the letter had to go before the tree people. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7747.471s">So</a>  I said, you know, is a dead tree equated with the life of a little kid on a bike? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7754.375s">Is</a>  that what you're waiting for, someone to really get hurt? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7757.157s">So</a>  time went by. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7758.558s">Winters</a>  came, went. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7760.099s">Finally,</a>  last year, I went to City Hall to Mike Nestero's department. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7764.765s">He</a>  happened to be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7766.426s">And</a>  I know that anger creates more anger. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7768.486s">So</a>  I was trying to be my best behave that day. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7772.327s">The</a>  secretary was taking notes. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7773.948s">And</a>  Mr. Nestor said, I'm overhearing what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7777.149s">And</a>  I had no idea this problem existed up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7780.53s">So</a>  thank you, Mr. Nestor and your assistant. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7783.371s">I</a>  think his name is Dennis. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7785.071s">Is</a>  it Dennehy? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7786.592s">They</a>  met me two weeks later with the group. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7788.913s">I</a>  think they were prisoners. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7790.393s">And</a>  those guys are real happy to be out that day. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7793.374s">They</a>  asked me, how's this look? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7795.495s">How's</a>  that look? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7796.136s">They</a>  cleared everything out to the point where the poor lady over there got all her kitchen windows exposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7803.46s">But,</a>  um, she said she's loving it because she doesn't have to look out on smell horrible stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7808.963s">This</a>  is Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7810.264s">Why</a>  does it take five years? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7812.245s">We</a>  said, well, maybe the city trucks are busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7814.707s">We</a>  were giving every kind of naive, you know, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7818.874s">you</a>  know, benefited the drought. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7820.935s">We're</a>  like, we don't see city trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7822.817s">They're</a>  not look busy to us, but he sent them out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7825.638s">And</a>  thank you, Mr. Nestor. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7826.879s">Again,</a>  we now can see through the corner with what he removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7831.822s">And</a>  I go there myself once a week now, and I take out any type of extra debris that's gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7837.365s">The</a>  neighbors are loving it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7839.487s">On</a>  that note of safety last year, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7843.476s">I</a>  came down here only on the suggestion of a friend who saw me weeks later. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7848.258s">I</a>  fell so hard on Forest Street on the sidewalk that I broke my two front teeth and I sprained my shoulder and had to wear a leg brace for two months. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7857.741s">I</a>  fell so hard that a constable coming by <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7860.942s">was</a>  kind enough to get me off the sidewalk because I couldn't get up. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7864.844s">So</a>  I want to thank you for reviewing that case for me and for going in consideration with what I had to pay to reconstruct my front teeth. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7876.791s">On</a>  that note, when I came to visit, I think it was Councilwoman Biona Luongo, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7881.736s">there</a>  was supposed to be an audit to the sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7884.797s">So</a>  I'm coming here tonight to find out if that audit indeed was ever begun. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7890.599s">Because</a>  since I fell, I've heard on talk radio, and also two other cases before this council, of older people who have fallen, have had to have shoulder surgery. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7902.002s">It's</a>  Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7903.343s">Can't</a>  we fix the sidewalks? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7905.683s">It's</a>  bad enough the poor policemen have to live in a bad hygiene situation <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7912.582s">station.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7913.402s">You</a>  can't even walk at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7914.823s">My</a>  neighbor won't walk the dogs at night anymore because he's too afraid of tripping over the broken sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7921.526s">So</a>  I happened to read in the newspaper that the state legislature recognized the adverse effect the past winter had on our city's infrastructure as well in the DPW budget, said Donato. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7935.272s">These</a>  funds will go a long way in helping Medford residents see necessary street and road repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7941.199s">costly</a>  damage caused by this winter's weather. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7945.66s">So</a>  does this mean that the, the budget money that you were questioning before Mr. President, um, if it does come, I've never read another piece of news since this was announced. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7957.463s">Is</a>  that only for, um, weather beaten streets in sidewalks or is this going to be a combination of hazardous walking? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7966.805s">And</a>  thank you for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7967.966s">Sorry</a>  to bother you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7969.532s">No</a>  bother at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7970.433s">Thank</a>  you for coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7972.714s">And</a>  we're going to send the question to the DBW regarding the audit of the sidewalks and the supplemental funds and their disbursement for the purpose of. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7984.063s">So</a>  the resolution is the resolution by Councilor Camuso to get an update on the sidewalk assessment and audit for repairs and <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=7996.782s">And</a>  the supplemental funds are delivered by Representative Donato, how they're being dispersed and in what areas for repairs of streets and sidewalks due to the excessive damage from the past record-breaking winter.</p>

    <p>[Sharon Deyeso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8014.714s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8015.334s">Would</a>  that mean that also, President Jaloruso, that they also would address just weather-beaten sidewalks? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8022.556s">Or</a>  what happens to all the sidewalks that are causing all the falls in the city, sir? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8026.937s">What</a>  would happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8027.818s">That</a>  would be covered under the audit?</p>

    <p>[Joe Viglione]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8029.698s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Sharon Deyeso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8030.658s">Oh,</a>  okay, thanks. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8031.859s">I</a>  thought it was important. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8033.479s">Also,</a>  in the light of this, with the spending, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8037.437s">We</a>  have a very fine engineering department, I'm sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8040.358s">Would</a>  they participate in this repair? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8043.999s">Do</a>  these jobs go out on bids? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8046.68s">I</a>  mean, it seems to me that we have very apt people as personnel who can work on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8052.643s">I'm</a>  just hoping it doesn't go out for a huge bid and that every penny of this is spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8058.145s">When</a>  we have people on the payrolls who are very capable of doing this, I compliment them again. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8064.167s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8064.917s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8066.258s">So</a>  on the motion for approval by Councilor Camuso, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8069.301s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8069.982s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8070.802s">Motion</a>  carries. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8071.883s">Congratulations.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8072.624s">Thank</a>  you, Sharon, for coming up tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8074.566s">While</a>  we're on to suspension, motions, orders, and resolutions 15-459, petition by Jean Martin, 10 Cumming Street, to speak on community policing. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8085.056s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8085.276s">Martin,</a>  please state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8087.858s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8088.419s">Jean</a>  Martin, 10 Cumming Street, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8090.081s">And</a>  it's hard to follow somebody that's very grateful because that very seldom happens here. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8094.105s">So</a>  I want to thank that lady for coming forward and I hope more people come forward when things are done right in the city and they give us compliments or give you guys compliments when things go right. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8106.339s">Community</a>  policing is what I'd like to talk about. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8110.837s">I'm</a>  a believer in the broken windows theory of policing, which is to say that if I see one word of graffiti on a wall, I can bet that shortly thereafter it'll be covered with graffiti. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8123.585s">And</a>  people are much less likely to litter on a well-kept lawn than on a yard that has one foot of high grass. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8129.589s">So</a>  when people maintain their property, it is less likely that somebody's just gonna throw a can of soda on that lawn if it's well-kept. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8138.803s">The</a>  question is, though, is what to do with these offenders. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8142.705s">Booking</a>  someone and creating a record for them is detrimental to their future employment and housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8148.549s">Well,</a>  once just a punk who spray-painted a wall soon snowballs into a real criminal, especially if he or she spent any time in more seasoned criminals in a prison system. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8160.885s">I</a>  would recommend that we look at new reforms in the city to keep small criminals from becoming a full-blown criminal by making the punishment fit the crime, i.e., if someone spray paints on a wall, we make him or her paint a bathroom in one of our many city buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8179.33s">So</a>  they get the punishment. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8180.69s">They</a>  have to clean up the wall that they spray painted, if we catch them, and they also have to do something else on top of that to pay for the crime that they committed so that they're held accountable and yet <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8190.788s">they</a>  don't get a record because once the person gets a record, then it just snowballs into more inappropriate behavior and the negativity just rolls on. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8201.115s">So</a>  that's different than violent crimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8203.677s">Please</a>  don't mistake this for violent criminal activity. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8207.119s">I'm</a>  talking about small stuff like broken windows. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8209.881s">If</a>  a kid breaks a window and then you see another kid break a window, if you catch them, I think that we should make them wash all these windows in the city hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8218.543s">So</a>  not only do they have to pay for the window that they broke, but make them wash the city windows in the city hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8224.368s">And</a>  that way they pay society back, they don't get a record, and we hopefully keep them from doing other stupid stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8231.775s">There</a>  are many components to community policing. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8234.317s">Neighborhood</a>  watches, having police walk the beat in the squares and parks. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8239.361s">The</a>  police officers, not just the chief of police, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8242.833s">need</a>  to be invited to churches, community centers, clubs, rotary, and every other formal and informal setting so that we see the police as part of the community and part of the solution, not the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8257.817s">Police</a>  officers are human. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8259.878s">I</a>  know that's a shock. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8261.379s">And</a>  if we don't personally know a police officer, we tend to forget that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8268.032s">Police</a>  officers also have husbands, wives, and children that are affected by the unique work that a police officer has and does. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8275.577s">So</a>  when we advocate for the police, we are also advocating for their families. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8280.32s">The</a>  stress officers suffers from a bad day is often felt by his or her family. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8285.343s">Another</a>  component to community policing is the need for more women officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8289.506s">Women</a>  officers can be extremely helpful in cases of domestic violence, prostitution, rape of men, women, and children. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8295.69s">Women</a>  officers are needed <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8297.512s">for</a>  women detainees to ensure women detainees' safety remains intact. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8303.495s">Women</a>  are also much more better at verbal skills to de-escalate a situation between two parties. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8312.119s">And</a>  that skill is going to be needed more in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8317.061s">That</a>  said, women officers must stay above reproach in order to hold that public trust in these most sensitive of areas like family disputes and physical assault. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8327.327s">Our</a>  police in general must also stand tall and be held to a higher standard than the general population, for they are the only ones given the charge and power to hold someone against their will. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8338.19s">They</a>  not only carry a weapon of deadly force, but are trained in deadly force. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8343.551s">Their</a>  body, hence, is a weapon of deadly force. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8346.952s">I</a>  know that this topic is not an easy one, but as for the black community, I am not sure that just hiring black officers will change the status of the black community in law enforcement and criminal justice. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8357.563s">Therefore,</a>  I am proposing the following, that the city agrees to appoint three volunteers from the black community and at least two volunteers from the white community to hold the official office of advocate whenever a black person is punished off the books or arrested for any charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8374.169s">These</a>  volunteers must, however, and I do stress must, be viewed by the entire city as valid representatives on behalf of the city and black people of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8382.491s">Their</a>  role is to ensure the fair treatment of the system within the law enforcement community. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8387.432s">These</a>  advocates' intentions will not be questioned because they will have no monetary gain from their positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8395.959s">The</a>  names of the five advocates must be listed on the MEDFED website and seen by every officer from top to bottom as legitimate. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8404.866s">A</a>  minister or other leaders in the NAACP and possibly one from the Haitian community could be a beginning start for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8412.412s">And</a>  there's a minister in the West MEDFED church that's a <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8416.545s">white</a>  guy, and he's very, very good, and I would recommend his name for one of the two positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8423.41s">He's</a>  in that West Medford Baptist Church over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8427.973s">Another</a>  type of community policing which needs to be explored is communication during power outage, like organizing ham radio civilian operators, thinking outside the box. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8440.261s">If</a>  our cell towers go down for a weather event or electricity goes down, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8446.035s">HIM</a>  operators could become one of the only forms of communication that we have, so they could be included. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8455.037s">Everything</a>  must be on the table to overcome an assault by weather events, mass events, or local crimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8461.239s">The</a>  arts and a bike trail, like you said, Mr. Marks, using the library as a shared space for the arts, because I believe that we need to create new ways of looking at old problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8473.633s">And</a>  the people that can do that is the arts community. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8475.855s">So</a>  I really am on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8478.517s">I</a>  don't believe in the Springstep thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8480.258s">But</a>  I do believe that the library could be elevated or reused completely for that purpose or shared with the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8489.125s">Community</a>  policing is a much larger concept than the old way of just catch-a-thief policing. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8494.089s">We</a>  have an increased population who, when they commit a small crime, end up living a life of crime. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8500.074s">And</a>  there are methods to stop this from happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8502.705s">But</a>  we have to work together as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8505.728s">And</a>  as far as the bike path, I would like to actually see a bike path from Tufts University down to Mecklen Square to help because the young people from there could actually add energy to this problem as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8518.718s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8519.639s">Thank</a>  you very much, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8520.62s">Martin.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8522.361s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8524.223s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8526.084s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8526.265s">Martin,</a>  I did want to touch on something that you opened up with, and that was <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8529.705s">you</a>  know, the theory or the situation where if someone gets caught spray painting on the street that they'd be responsible to come back into the community and do some painting or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8539.769s">And</a>  I wanted to make you aware of a bill that's pending before the Massachusetts State Legislature that was filed by our representative, Sean Garvely. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8546.472s">And</a>  this bill would authorize what's called restorative justice. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8550.734s">And</a>  the principles behind restorative justice are rather interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8555.396s">And</a>  the way that it works is, you know, the people that are <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8558.85s">most</a>  affected by the crime, the graffiti, would actually benefit collectively from the correction of action that's taken by the perpetrator after they're caught. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8569.017s">So</a>  I don't want to get into too much detail about restorative justice and the pros and cons and the theories behind it, but I did want to make you aware of the fact that there is some legislation pending at the House of Representatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8577.823s">Representative</a>  Gobley is the lead sponsor on the bill in the House, and I believe Senator Eldridge is the lead sponsor in the Senate. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8585.138s">And</a>  I suggest if you're really interested in doing a little bit more research, you give Representative Gobley a call, and I'm sure he'd be happy to talk with you about it.</p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8591.739s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8593.56s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8593.96s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Knight that the paper be received and placed on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8598.321s">All</a>  those in favor?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8599.041s">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8599.941s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8600.701s">The</a>  motion carries. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8603.202s">We</a>  have a couple of papers in the hand of the president, and we're getting to yours, offered by President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8611.264s">Be</a>  it resolved that the mayor <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8613.229s">further</a>  update the police patrol fleet with new vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8617.191s">If</a>  I might, from the chair, it's pretty clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8620.672s">We</a>  need more police cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8621.973s">We</a>  need new police cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8624.354s">343</a>  has had a dent on it for several months incurred from an altercation the automobile had during the blizzard. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8636.319s">We</a>  need more new police cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8638.6s">Please,</a>  Mr. Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8639.801s">So</a>  on that motion, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8641.401s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8643.578s">Motion</a>  carries. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8644.919s">By</a>  Councilor Marks, be it resolved that the Medford High School, Medford Vocational Technical High School, headmaster, teachers, staff, and Medford community be recognized for recently receiving a full accreditation for a 10-year period from the New England Association of Schools and Colleges. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8665.708s">They</a>  used to call it NEASC. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8667.609s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8670.368s">That's</a>  correct, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8671.529s">They</a>  still call it Neask. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8672.93s">In</a>  September of 2014, Neask, which is the New England Association of Schools and Colleges, visited Medford High School and Medford Vocational Technical High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8684.719s">And</a>  Medford received the best possible rating by the association for a full 10-year accreditation. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8692.705s">And</a>  I think it's only appropriate, Mr. President, that we thank Dr. Perrella, the headmaster, who has done yeoman's work <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8700.49s">up</a>  at that high school and gaining the confidence and improving the curriculum at the high school, and also the new director of the vocational school, who has also done Yeoman's work. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8712.313s">The</a>  teachers, what all good teachers and teachers that care, this accreditation wouldn't be what it was, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8720.075s">And</a>  the parents and the Medford community as a whole really had the whereabouts to make sure that <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8728.938s">Issues</a>  were addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8730.778s">You</a>  know, we addressed the science labs, which were prior to new science labs, we were in fear of accreditation or being reaccredited, and that came to fruition. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8744.121s">New</a>  computers back, I think it was two and a half, three years ago, throughout the school system, and a host of initiatives that have been put forward by Dr. Peralo, the teachers, and the Medford community at large. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8757.202s">And</a>  I just want to congratulate everyone in the system, including the superintendent of schools, Mr. President, who has been at the forefront for many years in public education. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8768.93s">And</a>  it's a new day and a new dawn in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8771.531s">And</a>  I look forward to a future bright and one that attracts students back from outside placements and outside settings, back to where they belong within our own Medford Public Schools, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8785.48s">Thank</a>  you for that resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8786.581s">So</a>  on the motion of approval by Councilor Marks, on that motion, Councilor Penta.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8793.186s">I</a>  want to thank Councilor Marks for bringing that up, but I would also like to, we haven't got a response back to the scuttlebutt that seems to be now emanating more and more of some kind of a merger between the high school and the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8805.175s">And</a>  I think we need to report back from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8806.796s">There</a>  was a school committee person here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8808.857s">I</a>  thought she was going to talk on it, but I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8810.759s">She</a>  left, but that's neither here or there. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8813.22s">I</a>  think it's very important to note if in fact, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8815.817s">And</a>  from what I understand, this is emanating from the high school side, not from the vocational school side. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8821.138s">So</a>  a lot of the teachers in the vocational school are pretty upset over the fact that, you know, they haven't been put into the loop. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8825.939s">They</a>  haven't been part of the discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8827.859s">So</a>  if vocational education is going to survive in the city of Medford, it just needs to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8832.46s">I</a>  think the community needs to know what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8835.221s">For</a>  whatever the proposal might be and the discussions that might be going on, you have to put all the parties together. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8840.462s">We</a>  asked for a joint meeting with the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8842.162s">They've</a>  yet to respond. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8843.763s">They</a>  probably won't respond because they don't want to answer the questions when we ask them. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8847.324s">These</a>  are hard questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8849.064s">And</a>  if it's a proposal and it sounds good, well, let's all hear about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8852.485s">But</a>  I don't think in a maze of an executive decision or executive administrators, they make this decision, and the whole vocational school now becomes an entirely different territory, so to speak, as compared to what the high school has to offer. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8866.328s">So</a>  again, Mr. Clark, I know you have it on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8868.728s">I'll</a>  probably repeat my request again, that we get a report back, what, if anything, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8874.353s">is</a>  the issue regarding a merger use between the high school and the vocational school as it relates to an incorporation of these classes, because that's what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8886.982s">The</a>  word seems to be they're only going to keep three of the vocational school courses that are certified by the Commonwealth, and the rest just become electives to some degree that a kid from the high school can take and have it merge. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8899.712s">And</a>  that, to me, would just destroy the whole <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8901.943s">idea</a>  of vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8903.084s">And</a>  then what are you going to do about all these kids that go to Minuteman? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8906.345s">I</a>  mean, where's the increased cost that they're going to take place if we start shipping kids to another vocational school because we're not going to be offering them the full-time services of a vocational school? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8916.35s">So</a>  I think it's paramount we get an answer back. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8919.812s">They</a>  can have the certification. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8921.053s">They</a>  deserve the certification. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8922.714s">They</a>  work for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8923.834s">But</a>  now if it's a new day dawn coming up to be, I think we need to know.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8928.08s">So</a>  on the motion of approval by Councilor Marks, amended by Councilor Penta.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8933.322s">And</a>  also, Mr. President, during this past week, there was a fire up at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8938.743s">And</a>  to the best of my knowledge, unfortunately, the fire department does not have a knock spark system that they used to have, which would have enabled them to get into the building without breaking windows and going through. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8950.126s">And</a>  also, if we're on this whole issue of the high school, why is there a full time <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8957.117s">fireperson</a>  there because the fire alarm system still is inoperative, I believe, on the third floor of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8964.48s">These</a>  are important questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8966.02s">Do</a>  you realize what the cost is to put a fireman there every single day to be a watchdog because the alarm systems aren't working or isn't working like it's supposed to concurrently, you know, within the whole building? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8978.465s">Can</a>  we get a report back on this, Mr. President, if we make these side papers, if you want B and C papers?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8984.402s">Well,</a>  we'll do them as amendments. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8986.502s">Councilor</a>  Marks?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8988.123s">Mr.</a>  President, just if I could, and I appreciate what Councilor Penta just mentioned about the separation of the vocational school and the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=8997.664s">And</a>  I can tell you there's not a stronger advocate in the city as a former graduate of Medford Vocational Technical High School for a vocational education in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9008.686s">But</a>  I can tell you what I experienced back so many years ago, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9012.872s">As</a>  a member of the vocational or student at the vocational school, there was always a clear separation. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9018.074s">Vocational</a>  kids never went past a certain set of doors, never mingled with high school kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9024.796s">Our</a>  lunches were separate. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9026.436s">The</a>  outside activities, the recesses were separate. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9030.058s">Everything</a>  was always separate. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9031.978s">And</a>  I think there's a movement now, and I'm not privy to any more information than anyone else is, but there's a movement underway starting from the new science labs, which <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9041.445s">the</a>  initiative took place about two years ago, to incorporate vocational education somewhat outside of the confines of the vocational school, which we all know is pretty much two hallways on two floors in the entire building. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9057.596s">And</a>  I see it as a very positive initiative to include vocational kids with the new science labs, to possibly open the curriculum to <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9070.974s">vocational</a>  kids that never had an option, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9075.015s">And</a>  I, as one, worked in the trade for a period of time and decided a trade wasn't for me, and went back to school and got a degree. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9083.598s">And</a>  I think that's what they're trying to instill within our vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9090.7s">And</a>  I'd rather see three or four shops in the vocational school that are solid shops attracting students than to have <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9100.492s">a</a>  host of shops that really don't attract many students. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9105.275s">And</a>  you don't want to go into them because there's no future in what the offerings are. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9112.078s">And</a>  I think there's a need to expand up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9114.58s">There's</a>  a need to offer state-of-the-art equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9119.042s">There's</a>  a need to look at the current offerings up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9122.724s">And</a>  I think that's what they're doing now. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9125.046s">And</a>  I, as one person, welcome that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9128.352s">I</a>  know when I was at the vocational school, we used to have a week of shop and a week of related. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9134.115s">And</a>  I think over the years, you know, the people much more educated than I said, you know what, we can no longer really have kids in the shop for one week because they're not getting the education that they need. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9146.382s">You</a>  know, people think you go into a vocational education, you don't need the education. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9150.824s">Let</a>  me tell you, a lot of kids I went to school with, they opened their own business. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9154.386s">And</a>  guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9154.827s">When</a>  you open your own business, it's not just a matter of, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9157.875s">turning</a>  a screw or hammering a nail. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9160.537s">It's</a>  a matter of doing the finances. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9162.939s">It's</a>  a matter of doing the bookkeeping. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9165.32s">It's</a>  a matter of doing the workers' compensation, health care, and everything else involved with opening a business, especially a small business. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9174.207s">And</a>  we have to make sure we educate these students, not just on the trade aspect, but also in the educational aspect and the aspect of opening a business or working in a company and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9186.777s">And</a>  I think that's what the vocational school's poised to do, and I hope there's gonna be a lot of dialogue, but I see it as a very positive thing, and I'm sure my council colleague does too, but we haven't heard the nuts and bolts of this, but there is something coming forward, and I think we're gonna see some changes, and change is healthy, in my opinion, and from what I see, it's necessary within our vocational school to keep it up to the 21st century, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9216.16s">provide</a>  the state-of-the-art offerings, and take back the 100 or so kids that go to Lexington Minute Man because the offerings that we have are inadequate, to be quite honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9226.969s">And</a>  I see it as positive, and I look forward to the discussion and dialogue, and I'm sure the school committee is something they're working on. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9234.555s">But</a>  this is a positive thing, and the interaction of vocational students with high school students and the use of <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9244.295s">The</a>  equipment and the technology, vice versa, works both ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9248.678s">And</a>  I see this as a win-win, Mr. President, and I look forward to it.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9257.363s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9259.084s">And</a>  Councilor Marks, thank you for your words, because I, too, remember that imaginary line down the middle of Medford High School that, you know, if you opened the doors and stepped into the vocational school for Medford High, you'd think that alarms were going to go off and someone was going to come and put you in detention. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9274.13s">I'm</a>  a firm believer in integration and inclusion, Mr. President, and I think that it adds a lot to education. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9279.954s">I</a>  think that it adds a lot to the experience, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9283.456s">Number</a>  two, I think that it's important when we look at what direction our vocational school is going in, which really, you know, should be established by the policy makers at the school department, we need to really put a focus on the fact of what our state's driver is, what our state's economy is, and that's really the life sciences and stem-based occupations, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9303.258s">providing</a>  a vocational education to our students and this vocational education isn't changing with the times, isn't changing with the actual economy that's out there for them to be employed in in the future, then we're not doing our job. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9314.885s">So,</a>  you know, again, I certainly am not scared to see the walls, those imaginary walls at Medford High School come down so that the children in the vocational school and the children in the high school can integrate and be included with each other, develop good friendships, develop a sense of community, a sense of rapport, Mr. President, and then become strong contributing members to our society here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9333.627s">With</a>  that being said, Mr. President, I certainly would like to see these papers separated. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9338.511s">On</a>  April 29th, we took a vote, and that vote stands. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9342.174s">It</a>  hasn't been 90 days since that vote's gone through. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9344.276s">Based</a>  on our rules, it's a paper that should be ruled out of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9347.318s">However,</a>  I'll leave it up to you to make a judgment on the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9350.181s">However,</a>  I'd support Councilor Marksley's resolution wholeheartedly to congratulate the administrators, faculty, staff, members of the school committee, and so on.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9358.727s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9359.128s">So</a>  on the motion to sever the resolutions, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9363.379s">On</a>  the main motion of Councilor Marks of congratulations, all those in favour? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9368.582s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9370.343s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9373.404s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9374.245s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9375.385s">Motion</a>  carries. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9376.886s">On</a>  the second part, the B paper of Councilor Penta reiterating previous requests to get an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9385.551s">All</a>  those in favour? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9386.392s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9387.352s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9388.573s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9390.674s">Motion</a>  carries. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9393.436s">Finally,</a>  reverting back to the regular order of business under the motion of Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9399.882s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9400.582s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9402.284s">Regular</a>  order of business, 15-455 offered by Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9406.427s">Be</a>  it resolved, since the mayor has yet to update the citizens, businesses, community of West Medford and this council on the contaminated West Medford parking lot underground soil <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9420.32s">a</a>  public hearing before the council be called with all parties invited. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9424.683s">Councilor</a>  Penta.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9427.685s">On</a>  March 11th of this past year, just two months, we had a resolution that was passed unanimously by this council for the purposes of getting an update as to what's going on as it relates to the remediation of the parking lot in West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9442.156s">We</a>  still haven't heard anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9443.577s">As</a>  Councilor Caraviello will attest to, we've heard numbers range anywhere <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9447.101s">from</a>  $2 million to almost $7, $8, $9 million to have this thing remediated. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9452.142s">Come</a>  to find out that supposedly on March 14, two days later, excuse me, on March 13, a meeting did take place with the Director of Energy and Environment as it relates to the brownfields, the dirt contamination, the cleanup efforts, and the buildings that have been affected in West Medford in that particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9477.53s">Now,</a>  we know we have a mayor that's going out of office. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9479.931s">He's</a>  made that announcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9482.553s">You</a>  have a budget director that's going to be leaving at the end of the week, because that person is deciding to try to go to other places. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9490.277s">And</a>  we have a multimillion-dollar issue facing us right here, again, with no resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9497.32s">This</a>  is not making any sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9499.842s">There's</a>  a time schedule that was proposed way back when as to what would take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9504.424s">We</a>  were told that we would be kept into the loop. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9506.545s">We</a>  were told the public hearings that would take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9509.847s">And</a>  part of the report that was submitted on March 13th indicates there was additional work that must be done to meet EPA requirements before a preferred work plan can be presented to the occupants of the buildings and to the general public in that particular parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9525.196s">Now,</a>  we haven't seen or heard anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9528.038s">And</a>  it's just not making any sense at all, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9531.58s">The</a>  last time we got an update was August 11, 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9536.217s">Now</a>  we're talking about March of 2015, and we still have no response as to what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9546.162s">So</a>  I don't know where we're going with all of this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9549.143s">I</a>  really think we need to be apprised as to what is going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9553.985s">Excuse</a>  me, I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9555.386s">It's</a>  March of 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9557.106s">The</a>  last time we had any communication was August of 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9562.569s">So</a>  we're well over six, seven, eight months <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9566.033s">and</a>  not getting any response. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9567.614s">We're</a>  not getting anything as with the state DEP or the EPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9572.996s">We're</a>  getting no cost proposals or anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9575.077s">So</a>  again, why are the department heads just refusing to answer us? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9579.94s">Why</a>  is the mayor doing this? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9582.381s">He's</a>  leaving. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9582.941s">He</a>  doesn't care. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9584.022s">It's</a>  quite obvious he hasn't cared for a long period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9587.443s">But</a>  the taxpayers need to know because this is going to cost them. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9590.885s">It's</a>  going to be out of their pocket one way or the other if we don't get any bonds <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9595.263s">or</a>  we don't get any federal, we don't get any state money. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9599.445s">I</a>  don't know, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9601.946s">You</a>  know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9602.946s">I'd</a>  like to move that we have Alicia Hunt. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9605.387s">She's</a>  the environmental person. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9607.128s">Come</a>  down and meet with us and give us an update as to what's going on, because it's obvious that our city engineer is not doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9614.591s">We've</a>  asked for her to come down. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9615.952s">She</a>  responds and, you know, I don't even know who to talk to around here anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9621.494s">Does</a>  anybody know who's in charge? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9624.775s">Well,</a>  Fidel Russo, in a few weeks, will be in charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9628.717s">Yeah?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9629.698s">Well,</a>  you said it, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9631.559s">Remember,</a>  loud and clear, and I agree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9634.04s">That's</a>  the rumor. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9634.72s">Let</a>  me tell you, if that rumor comes to fruition, if that rumor comes to fruition, shame on this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9641.764s">Shame</a>  on this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9643.005s">Shame</a>  on this city? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9644.485s">Shame</a>  on this city, because you know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9646.447s">I</a>  don't even know if you want the job. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9647.627s">I</a>  don't know if you're up for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9650.128s">I</a>  think you have a hard time with this job. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9651.649s">I</a>  don't know what you would do as being mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9654.659s">So,</a>  well, let's say, listen, why would he mix 500,000 in another job? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9661.301s">Why</a>  would you want to pay for 141? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9665.482s">Well,</a>  if you don't like me here, then what do you want me to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9668.143s">Don't</a>  tell me what to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9669.083s">You</a>  run. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9669.804s">If</a>  you think it's such a great job, it's personal. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9672.504s">I'm</a>  very comfortable too. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9673.645s">So</a>  don't tell me what to do.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9676.058s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9677.139s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Penta that the Director of Environmental Affairs meet with the City and meet with us and give us an update.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9688.586s">Meet</a>  with, an update, present themselves before the Council for an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9691.347s">You</a>  know something, you better enclose the Office of Community Development because they had something to do with this with Brown and Carlwell as it relates to that.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9696.991s">We</a>  will also invite not only the City Engineer, the Head of Environmental Affairs and the OCD Director. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9707.768s">And</a>  so, on the motion of Councilor Penta, Councilor Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9712.029s">Mr.</a>  President, I was notified by one of the businesses down there in the west side today that the mayor is going ahead with his injection plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9725.312s">I'm</a>  just, I was, that they were informed that he was going to go away, he was going ahead with, they were going to dig up some dirt and inject the chemicals under the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9734.175s">That</a>  was one of the plans that was talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9736.653s">So</a>  I don't know, but let's say I found that out today through one of the businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9741.636s">So</a>  maybe that's true. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9743.257s">Maybe</a>  it's not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9743.897s">I</a>  don't know.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9748.2s">As</a>  it relates to council, um, cover yellows terminology, March of last year, they were supposed to establish a quality assurance plan made in June of last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9758.646s">They</a>  were supposed to collect all the data that was needed to refine, to refine phase three. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9763.743s">July</a>  and August last year, they're supposed to write the phase three plan, which would be four to six weeks out. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9768.887s">In</a>  September, there was supposed to be a public comment period. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9771.108s">We</a>  never had it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9772.049s">October,</a>  the city was supposed to respond to the comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9774.41s">We</a>  never heard anything about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9775.711s">In</a>  late fall and winter final, they will have the final remediation design. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9780.234s">That's</a>  what the city signed off on. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9784.878s">We</a>  haven't seen any of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9786.719s">And</a>  now you're telling me he's going to be digging holes and sticking liquid in there?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9799.13s">And</a>  then they inject chemicals under the buildings and the chemical is supposed to dissipate.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9807.637s">That</a>  was something that was discussed but it wasn't decided upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9811.06s">You</a>  can't decide on anything when you haven't had the public hearing.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9814.683s">I</a>  was informed by one of the building owners today.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9819.347s">On</a>  that motion, Councilor Camuso.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9821.328s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9822.529s">You</a>  know who I really feel bad for in this whole debacle? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9825.394s">is</a>  the business owners on those three properties that are affected by a contaminated lot that is owned by the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9833.759s">I</a>  know that the administration was doing their due diligence to see if there was insurance policies in place to go back and go after whoever contaminated this land 80 years ago, but the fact of the matter is these businesses are suffering. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9849.508s">You</a>  go into any of those businesses and <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9853.411s">They</a>  have the breathing, sorry, they have the equipment in them to make sure that they're breathing quality air. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9860.614s">They're</a>  having the levels tested. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9863.455s">It's</a>  just, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9865.476s">We</a>  have to have some sort of a plan for this as a community, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9870.378s">If</a>  indeed it's gonna be costing the amount of money they're saying to do this, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9875.86s">Take</a>  all three properties by eminent domain, do a whole development, and at the same time you clean it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9882.493s">You</a>  clean it up, and you give these people back somehow, some way. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9885.634s">You</a>  know you work it out that the current owners would be paid for the value of their land, but they'd also be given an opportunity in the new development, whatever it may be, to do the same type of establishment. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9902.038s">You</a>  know? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9903.639s">First</a>  right of refusal and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9906.14s">I</a>  mean, enough is enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9909.52s">That's</a>  where the vision comes into play. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9911.779s">You</a>  don't have to, it's like Locust Street, when people say, we gotta do some rezoning down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9916.163s">Well,</a>  guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9917.064s">Locust</a>  Street in that area can be reconfigured. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9919.506s">It</a>  doesn't have to remain Locust Street, a straight shot from Mystic Valley Parkway to Riverside Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9924.09s">It</a>  can be called the Saks. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9925.17s">It</a>  can be a shopping area on the Mystic River. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9929.975s">There's</a>  a lot of options down there, but this is where vision comes into place, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9935.139s">But</a>  the business owners, I'm sorry, the property owners, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9939.374s">It's</a>  coming to a point now where they're lucky that this hasn't put some of them out of business. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9945.98s">The</a>  amount of money and funding and time and energy that they've put into this project.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9954.805s">through</a>  councillor yeah but thank you last but not least has the city ever looked into working out some arrangement where they could take over the whole thing buy it by the property from the owners and do a development which will pay for the cleanup essentially hopefully we'll get those questions answered when we have those department heads before us this is a good issue for an update it's an important issue so on the motion of councillor Penta</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9983.618s">Councilor</a>  Pentland. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9984.539s">On</a>  that motion, Councilor Camuso is alluding to, I know one in particular is just having a hard time, can't even refinance because the bank is aware of the fact of the chemical problem over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=9994.524s">But</a>  you must have been reading my notes because we had this discussion a couple of years ago as it relates to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10000.067s">Here's</a>  where a perfect public-private partnership could take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10003.609s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10004.149s">Okay,</a>  you could take that whole area over there, ask all the business people to put in whatever the X amount is, the city puts in X amount of money, the state, I mean, he has his <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10013.23s">He</a>  has the ability to do all the parks over three times. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10015.611s">Let</a>  him find out some money for business. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10017.492s">You're</a>  killing them with the land over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10019.594s">You</a>  killed them with a 10-year contract for the trash, a 10-year contract for the kiosk, a 10-year contract with Comcast, and then you're going to leave town with this mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10029.499s">Well,</a>  Councilor Penta, let me just talk a little bit more about vision. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10033.121s">There's</a>  no vision there when you're talking about 10 years.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10035.002s">No,</a>  I'm talking about Paul Camuso's vision, not the mayor or anyone else. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10038.204s">This</a>  is Paul Camuso's vision. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10041.475s">Think</a>  about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10043.195s">We</a>  have money that's set aside right now in a transportation bond bill for the garage in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10048.397s">We</a>  could put some sort of parking down there that could abut the train station, where it currently exists on the other side of the tracks, so the train doesn't even have to stop anymore and basically cause the confusion that it does, and it stops for 20 minutes when it's an inbound train. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10063.68s">There's</a>  stuff to be done down there, potentially, by using some of these monies and capital that's put aside. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10070.278s">You</a>  know, but unless you get engaged in the conversation and talk about bringing a real solution to the table, we're just going to keep having conversations about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10080.284s">But</a>  this is a real good opportunity for a public-private partnership to get together for the city to purchase the land in question. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10088.989s">I'm</a>  sorry, the buildings that's directly around the land. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10097.294s">You</a>  clean up the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10099.134s">And</a>  then you turn around and you put it up for bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10102.916s">And</a>  here's the other thing, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10106.438s">If</a>  we're doing that, a developer can come in and put a garage underground. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10110.681s">A</a>  garage underground in West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10112.322s">Add</a>  another 200 spots to West Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10116.405s">This</a>  is all stuff that should be talked about.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10119.006s">Or</a>  bury the train.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10120.847s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10121.508s">I</a>  mean, you look at that specific land, it's perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10124.409s">It's</a>  like a triangle. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10125.769s">It's</a>  got the building where Snappy Patty's is, you have the liquor store and the hair salon, and then you have the building out behind it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10132.213s">You've</a>  got a good acre, acre and a half of land there if you put it all together with very, very, very good potential. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10138.777s">Right</a>  now, what is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10140.698s">It's</a>  a sick area that is going to cost us millions of dollars to clean. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10144.18s">Let's</a>  try to come up with something to clean it up <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10147.756s">And</a>  I'm sure the business owners too, and we certainly can't speak to them, file them, because this is just quick thoughts. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10155.912s">But</a>  the liquor store, for instance. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10161.484s">They</a>  get a brand new site to operate his current business. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10163.925s">You're</a>  going to have more environmentally friendly coolers. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10166.306s">You're</a>  going to have more environmentally friendly business. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10169.787s">You're</a>  going to have more environmentally friendly cooling systems, heating and HVAC air conditioners, and just the regular heating. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10178.01s">I</a>  mean, monthly expenses will go down with a new development there for the current landowners. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10184.773s">But</a>  this is where you have to have a vision. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10189.142s">Like</a>  I said, Locust Street, I think we're missing the boat on Locust Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10193.404s">And</a>  that's why I didn't support another auto body shop down there a year and a half ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10199.067s">Because</a>  Locust Street is a premier spot to get a good development like a Stations Landing. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10204.73s">No</a>  one ever thought Stations Landing would be as beautiful as it is today. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10209.232s">Nobody.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10209.892s">What</a>  was Stations Landing previously known for? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10212.314s">Going</a>  down to get your Christmas trees, going to Bickford's, and then going to Strawberries to get a new record of tape when it came out. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10217.356s">That</a>  was about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10219.318s">What</a>  was it? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10219.878s">Richard's</a>  car. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10221.199s">Richard's</a>  car hop. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10221.96s">You're</a>  a little bit older. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10223.441s">Um,</a>  but with that being said, uh, that, that, that had some vision and there's no reason why some other of these other areas in our community that are blighted somewhat or environmentally sick can't be done in the same way. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10235.51s">Look</a>  at the DPW yard. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10236.851s">The</a>  DPW yard looks beautiful now.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10240.274s">Very</a>  nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10241.034s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10241.355s">Councilor</a>  Musil. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10244.137s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10245.438s">I</a>  think what Councilor Pinter and Councilor Camuso are looking for, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10248.86s">It's</a>  called the Office of Redevelopment, which we do not have in this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10253.303s">Redevelopment</a>  Authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10254.204s">It's</a>  called Redevelopment, not OCD or anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10256.946s">It's</a>  Redevelopment.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10258.948s">Very</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10259.608s">I</a>  would hope that the new mayor has that vision to put that into the new administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10265.673s">Oh,</a>  he will.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10267.154s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Penta, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10270.297s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10270.997s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10272.138s">Motion</a>  carries. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10273.779s">The</a>  records, the tabled records of the April 20th meeting were passed by Councilor <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10278.915s">So</a>  on the motion of council Camuso for approval all those in favor all those opposed motion Passes the records of the May 5th 2015 meeting were passed to council Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10290.07s">That's</a>  a caveo How did you find those records mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/E2oeLkYbA5Q&t=10292.893s">I</a>  find them in order motion for approval on the motion of approval the records of May 5th by council Carve yellow all those in favor all those opposed Records are approved on the motion of constant night to adjourn all those in favor all those opposed</p>
