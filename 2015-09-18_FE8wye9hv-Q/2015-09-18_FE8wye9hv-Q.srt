[SPEAKER_08]: I'm Victoria Rasche, one of the men reporters.

3
00:00:08,452 --> 00:00:12,235
[SPEAKER_08]: We will be coming to you with different school events and community events throughout the year.

10
00:00:33,743 --> 00:00:40,948
[SPEAKER_23]: by junior student from Medford High School, Sam, sophomore, Hannah, and what else did I come for?

11
00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:56,640
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh say can you see, by the dawn's early light, what so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming?

12
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:12,429
[SPEAKER_19]: Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight, O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming?

13
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:18,893
[SPEAKER_19]: And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air,

14
00:01:20,434 --> 00:01:27,597
[SPEAKER_19]: Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.

15
00:01:27,617 --> 00:01:46,465
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave o'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

16
00:01:53,553 --> 00:01:54,953
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm here with the Mustang News.

21
00:02:09,278 --> 00:02:14,160
[SPEAKER_07]: We're really excited, especially because it's the first home game and we think the boys will do really well.

22
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,581
[SPEAKER_07]: So how is your season looking being in competition this year?

23
00:02:18,181 --> 00:02:21,121
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this year will be our first time competing in three years.

24
00:02:21,561 --> 00:02:22,582

25
00:02:22,622 --> 00:02:28,123
[SPEAKER_07]: We finally raised enough money and our team is strong enough to compete and I'm really excited to see what we do on the mat.

[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, I'm Joss McCarthy and I'm here with Elsa and Anna and I want to know how your experience at Community Day is.

29
00:02:45,143 --> 00:02:48,105
[SPEAKER_08]: So, so far we've seen a lot of little kids and it's been a blast.

30
00:02:48,145 --> 00:02:56,510
[SPEAKER_08]: They've all sang with us and they've all talked to us and they all just get really excited when they see us and I'm really excited to see them and so is Anna, of course, but we're having a blast.

31
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,971
[SPEAKER_08]: Taking a lot of pictures.

32
00:03:00,172 --> 00:03:02,414
[SPEAKER_13]: The little kids love us.

33
00:03:02,454 --> 00:03:03,515
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Alsanana.

34
00:03:04,156 --> 00:03:05,297
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, I'm Cariann Luchares.

35
00:03:05,357 --> 00:03:07,218
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm here with Aiden and Tripp with Troop 416.

36
00:03:07,378 --> 00:03:09,880
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you guys tell us a little bit about your program?

37
00:03:11,742 --> 00:03:15,065
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're based off Medford, in Medford, Massachusetts.

38
00:03:15,085 --> 00:03:18,988
[SPEAKER_04]: And recently, well, we just came back from summer camp up in TL Store.

39
00:03:19,188 --> 00:03:19,709
[SPEAKER_04]: How was that?

40
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:20,829
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really fun.

41
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,251
[SPEAKER_04]: One of my favorite years so far.

42
00:03:22,271 --> 00:03:25,233
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you guys have any upcoming events that we should know about?

43
00:03:27,995 --> 00:03:32,418
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, recently we're going to help a fellow scout complete his Eagle Scout project.

44
00:03:33,499 --> 00:03:42,185
[SPEAKER_20]: We do a lot of community service projects, such as marking the trains out all over the city of Medford.

45
00:03:42,205 --> 00:03:44,867
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm here with Captain Trisha McLean from Medford Girls Hockey.

46
00:03:44,907 --> 00:03:46,889
[SPEAKER_13]: Trisha, how are you feeling about community day today?

47
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:47,810
[SPEAKER_11]: It's great!

48
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:50,471
[SPEAKER_11]: Not so good weather, but everyone's still out having fun.

49
00:03:51,357 --> 00:03:52,658
[SPEAKER_11]: How are you feeling about this season?

50
00:03:52,678 --> 00:03:53,759
[SPEAKER_11]: It's gonna be good.

51
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:54,720
[SPEAKER_11]: A new one.

52
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,781
[SPEAKER_11]: It's gonna be good though.

53
00:03:55,921 --> 00:03:57,002
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you excited to be captain?

54
00:03:57,262 --> 00:03:57,762
[SPEAKER_11]: Definitely.

55
00:03:57,782 --> 00:04:06,210
[SPEAKER_26]: It's gonna be good.

56
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,130
[SPEAKER_26]: 10 out of 10 pizza.

57
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:07,771
[SPEAKER_26]: S.A.

58
00:04:08,031 --> 00:04:09,592
[SPEAKER_26]: Scott Andrew rates it 10 out of 10.

59
00:04:10,033 --> 00:04:10,333
[SPEAKER_26]: Very good.

60
00:04:10,653 --> 00:04:13,456
[SPEAKER_26]: We are selling cheese pizza and we are selling pepperoni pizza.

61
00:04:13,996 --> 00:04:15,017
[SPEAKER_26]: Which would you recommend?

62
00:04:15,778 --> 00:04:17,039
[SPEAKER_26]: It all depends on the person, you know?

63
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,680
[SPEAKER_26]: They're both extremely good.

64
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,062
[SPEAKER_26]: If you like pepperoni pizza, then get pepperoni pizza.

65
00:04:21,102 --> 00:04:22,964
[SPEAKER_26]: If you like cheese pizza, get some cheese pizza.

66
00:04:23,584 --> 00:04:25,246
[SPEAKER_12]: We have... Captain McCourt.

67
00:04:25,506 --> 00:04:26,307
[SPEAKER_03]: What's it like in there?

68
00:04:27,096 --> 00:04:47,510
[SPEAKER_12]: Well we fill it with smoke and try to teach people how to get through a house if there's ever a fire at their house and also there's things such as we duplicate what would be a bedroom door and we want people to know what they have to do if they're at home and they're sleeping and their door's closed hopefully to their bedroom.

69
00:04:48,391 --> 00:04:53,536
[SPEAKER_12]: how to touch it to feel if it's hot and to see if there's fire on the other side of the door and whether or not to open it.

70
00:04:54,056 --> 00:04:58,260
[SPEAKER_12]: And sometimes if we have enough time, we'll talk to them a little bit about safety in the kitchen.

71
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:03,544
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a mock kitchen here and there's a phone on the wall, what number to dial if there's an emergency.

72
00:05:03,584 --> 00:05:04,966
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course, everybody knows what that is. 911.

73
00:05:11,434 --> 00:05:13,355
[SPEAKER_05]: MHTV 15 and the Mustang Report.

74
00:05:13,595 --> 00:05:16,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Today we're here with Ciara and Sebastian at Medford's Community Day.

75
00:05:16,436 --> 00:05:17,077
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you today?

76
00:05:17,357 --> 00:05:17,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.

77
00:05:17,937 --> 00:05:18,217
Good.

78
00:05:18,517 --> 00:05:19,018
[SPEAKER_25]: Very good.

79
00:05:19,758 --> 00:05:23,079
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Ciara, what has been your favorite part of this entire day?

80
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,440
[SPEAKER_05]: The motorcycles.

81
00:05:25,841 --> 00:05:28,482
[SPEAKER_05]: And now, Dad, how do you feel about the motorcycles?

82
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:30,280
[SPEAKER_25]: They're great.

83
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,322
[SPEAKER_25]: They do a lot for the community and a lot of the kids like it out here.

84
00:05:33,362 --> 00:05:35,804
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, it's fun to get out here and have some fun.

85
00:05:35,824 --> 00:05:42,569
[SPEAKER_25]: The motorcycles are, you know, a very unique part of our force and they do a lot to keep the community safe and the roads safe.

86
00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:48,253
[SPEAKER_05]: And how have you, how do you think that the day has gone today so far as well as all the events and everything happening?

87
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:50,441
[SPEAKER_25]: As you can see, it's very successful.

88
00:05:50,461 --> 00:05:54,465
[SPEAKER_25]: There's a lot of kids out here, a lot of smiles, so as long as I see smiles, I know it's going good.

89
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:56,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you going to come back next year?

90
00:05:56,808 --> 00:05:57,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

91
00:05:57,589 --> 00:05:58,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, now back to you.

92
00:05:59,531 --> 00:06:00,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, I'm Allison Goldsberry.

93
00:06:00,853 --> 00:06:02,775
[SPEAKER_24]: Hi, I'm Dan Costello.

94
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,845
[SPEAKER_03]: We are part of the MHS Alumni Association.

95
00:06:06,926 --> 00:06:15,913
[SPEAKER_03]: We are a new organization, so we're here just to get our name out and to let people know that we primarily raise money for scholarships for graduating seniors at Medford High.

96
00:06:16,013 --> 00:06:20,537
[SPEAKER_03]: That I want to mention is that we're having our fourth annual Medford Night on Friday.

97
00:06:20,617 --> 00:06:21,237
[SPEAKER_03]: It's November 27th.

98
00:06:22,618 --> 00:06:28,302
[SPEAKER_03]: The day after Thanksgiving, it's become an annual tradition that everybody comes to John Brewer's Tavern.

99
00:06:28,342 --> 00:06:31,724
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a multi-year reunion, doesn't matter what year you graduated.

100
00:06:32,104 --> 00:06:35,587
[SPEAKER_03]: We always raise a lot of money for our scholarships on that day.

101
00:06:35,627 --> 00:06:40,990
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a fun night, people are in town, it's a holiday, and it's just a great night to be out.

102
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:48,495
[SPEAKER_03]: So John Brewer's Tavern, there'll be trivia, there'll be raffles, you'll see people from all different class years, so you guys should definitely join us.

103
00:06:48,555 --> 00:06:52,198
[SPEAKER_03]: Friday night, day after Thanksgiving at John Brewer's Tavern in Malden.

104
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:54,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thank you so much.

105
00:06:54,421 --> 00:06:54,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye

106
00:07:05,435 --> 00:07:06,515
[SPEAKER_15]: She didn't cry.

107
00:07:37,026 --> 00:07:44,390
[SPEAKER_06]: So how are you guys enjoying community day so far?

108
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:45,631
[SPEAKER_22]: It's awesome.

109
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:49,493
[SPEAKER_22]: I think my favorite part of community day is this petting zoo right here.

110
00:07:49,973 --> 00:07:51,294
[SPEAKER_06]: What's your favorite animal?

111
00:07:52,234 --> 00:07:52,835
[SPEAKER_22]: I like the goats.

112
00:07:53,475 --> 00:07:56,757
[SPEAKER_22]: We met a couple animals but my favorite is by far Kevin the goat.

113
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:58,998
[SPEAKER_06]: Which one is he?

114
00:08:00,663 --> 00:08:03,947
[SPEAKER_22]: He's the one right there with mostly white, and he's pretty cool.

115
00:08:04,047 --> 00:08:04,908
[SPEAKER_22]: I named him myself.

116
00:08:05,929 --> 00:08:06,450
[SPEAKER_22]: Look, Kevin!

117
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:07,551
[SPEAKER_22]: What up, Kevin?

118
00:08:08,252 --> 00:08:09,653
[SPEAKER_22]: I told you, Kevin loves us.

119
00:08:11,295 --> 00:08:16,401
[SPEAKER_22]: What I figure is, the llama, he runs this place, and the turkey is like his right-hand man.

120
00:08:16,862 --> 00:08:20,266
[SPEAKER_22]: The llama's like the nice guy, but the turkey's very mean.

121
00:08:21,448 --> 00:08:23,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, I'm Amber Harbison with the Mustang Report.

122
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:25,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Today we're here with Max Charles.

123
00:08:25,469 --> 00:08:29,831
[SPEAKER_09]: He's one of the top runners and soccer athletes for the Medford High teams.

124
00:08:30,451 --> 00:08:31,391
[SPEAKER_09]: Max, how are you doing today?

125
00:08:31,631 --> 00:08:32,231
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm doing fine.

126
00:08:32,832 --> 00:08:36,153
[SPEAKER_09]: What kind of training have you been doing for soccer and track this summer?

127
00:08:36,613 --> 00:08:42,014
[SPEAKER_21]: So I had a soccer camp over the summer, and we did a lot of running and practicing with the ball.

128
00:08:42,175 --> 00:08:45,616
[SPEAKER_21]: And all that running and stuff gets my legs strong.

129
00:08:45,656 --> 00:08:49,737
[SPEAKER_21]: So when it comes track time, I just get faster.

130
00:08:50,592 --> 00:08:51,132
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Max.

131
00:08:51,192 --> 00:08:53,013
[SPEAKER_09]: We hope to see you running soon.

132
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:56,514
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, I'm Amber Harbison, and I'm a reporter with the Mustang Report.

133
00:08:56,934 --> 00:08:59,335
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's talk some volleyball with the girls captains this year.

134
00:09:05,718 --> 00:09:11,480
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, this is Amber Harbison with the Mustang Report, and I'm here with the 2015 girls volleyball captains.

135
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,762
[SPEAKER_09]: They started their season about a week ago, and let's hear from Victoria about how their season went.

136
00:09:18,055 --> 00:09:24,097
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so, so far we've had one game against AC, Arlington Catholic, and then another game against Lowell.

137
00:09:24,437 --> 00:09:30,880
[SPEAKER_08]: Both of those games weren't GBL games, luckily, because we lost in three matches on both games.

138
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:40,704
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think we've learned a lot from both games, and what we've learned is going to help us on our GBL games and the future games to improve and become a better team.

139
00:09:42,524 --> 00:09:46,506
[SPEAKER_09]: Katrina, how do you think you can improve for your next game, and when is your next game?

140
00:09:47,935 --> 00:09:49,356
[SPEAKER_14]: So our next game is today.

141
00:09:49,596 --> 00:09:50,256
[SPEAKER_14]: You all should come.

142
00:09:50,296 --> 00:09:51,057
[SPEAKER_14]: It'll be a lot of fun.

143
00:09:51,077 --> 00:09:51,917
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to beat Malden.

144
00:09:52,877 --> 00:09:57,079
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we need to improve just communication-wise.

145
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:03,022
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't talk a lot on the court, but I think after our practice yesterday, we really connected more.

146
00:10:03,262 --> 00:10:04,903
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're definitely going to be talking more.

147
00:10:07,182 --> 00:10:08,003
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think cheering.

148
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,364
[SPEAKER_14]: We need more fans there.

149
00:10:09,384 --> 00:10:10,606
[SPEAKER_14]: We need more people to come.

150
00:10:11,186 --> 00:10:15,551
[SPEAKER_14]: So if more people come, you guys at home, you all should come.

151
00:10:15,571 --> 00:10:16,732
[SPEAKER_14]: It'll be a lot of fun.

152
00:10:16,852 --> 00:10:22,478
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think we could potentially win GBL again and be the only winners.

153
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:27,123
[SPEAKER_10]: And Jocelyn, how do you think the rest of the season is going to go?

154
00:10:29,372 --> 00:10:32,474
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the best of the season is going to be pretty good.

155
00:10:32,514 --> 00:10:37,458
[SPEAKER_10]: We lost two games, even though that was our first two games, but we haven't glued as a team yet.

156
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,281
[SPEAKER_10]: So today is going to be our first game to win, and it's against Malden.

157
00:10:41,862 --> 00:10:46,245
[SPEAKER_10]: And we still have a long season ahead of us, 13 more games, I say.

158
00:10:46,865 --> 00:10:48,186
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're going to do really good at them.

159
00:10:48,627 --> 00:10:52,730
[SPEAKER_10]: And we'll all glue together eventually, and I think today will be the day.

160
00:10:55,202 --> 00:10:58,285
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you girls, I'm excited to see how the rest of your season goes.

161
00:10:58,605 --> 00:11:00,466
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Amber with the Mustang Report.

162
00:11:00,687 --> 00:11:03,009
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, I'm Jocelyn McCarthy here with the Mustang Report.

163
00:11:03,409 --> 00:11:06,191
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's Mr. Nascimento talking about the MHS football team.

164
00:11:06,211 --> 00:11:08,153
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, I'm Karianne Luchares and I'm from the Mustang News.

165
00:11:08,233 --> 00:11:11,516
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm here with head coaching guidance Councilor Mr. Nascimento.

166
00:11:11,876 --> 00:11:12,937
[SPEAKER_13]: How does your season look so far?

167
00:11:14,325 --> 00:11:16,346
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, we were only one game in so far.

168
00:11:17,086 --> 00:11:21,027
[SPEAKER_24]: We did not get off to a good start Friday night, but that's in the past.

169
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:21,948
[SPEAKER_24]: We're on to the next one.

170
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:27,049
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think, you know, as a coaching staff, we're still very optimistic about this season.

171
00:11:27,129 --> 00:11:30,931
[SPEAKER_24]: And I still think we can continue to progress and go in the right direction.

172
00:11:32,111 --> 00:11:35,372
[SPEAKER_13]: So what is your football philosophy and what kind of things do you believe in?

173
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:44,831
[SPEAKER_24]: I have a lot of philosophies and a lot of things I believe in, but we preach discipline, commitment, toughness, effort, and pride every day.

174
00:11:45,091 --> 00:11:54,132
[SPEAKER_24]: So if all of our guys can bring those five things to practice and game night every week, we'll be successful.

175
00:11:54,252 --> 00:11:57,553
[SPEAKER_24]: And it's not just about the football aspect.

176
00:11:57,613 --> 00:12:01,694
[SPEAKER_24]: It's about how these things carry over into the real world and after they graduate.

177
00:12:01,734 --> 00:12:02,914
[SPEAKER_24]: And it's about preparing them for

178
00:12:03,567 --> 00:12:05,309
[SPEAKER_24]: the next step of their lives afterwards.

179
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:08,092
[SPEAKER_24]: So discipline, commitment, toughness, effort, pride.

180
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:13,938
[SPEAKER_13]: So how do you handle the criticism from other people and how do you help your players overcome that criticism?

181
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:22,248
[SPEAKER_24]: We just completely just we get the blinders on and you know any criticism from the outside I mean

182
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,981
[SPEAKER_24]: We don't really pay any attention to that.

183
00:12:26,582 --> 00:12:27,542
[SPEAKER_24]: It's on to the next one.

184
00:12:27,562 --> 00:12:32,526
[SPEAKER_24]: Win or lose, when we lose it's on to the next one and when we win it's on to the next one.

185
00:12:34,007 --> 00:12:35,448
[SPEAKER_24]: Either way it's the same message.

186
00:12:36,468 --> 00:12:40,591
[SPEAKER_24]: We don't really pay attention to what people are saying outside of the people in the locker room.

187
00:12:40,611 --> 00:12:44,814
[SPEAKER_14]: Katrina Rashia, I'm here with MHS TV and we're interviewing Miss Horn about DreamFar.

188
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,197
[SPEAKER_14]: So Miss Horn, why did you decide to start DreamFar?

189
00:12:48,897 --> 00:12:50,738
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just started DreamFar.

190
00:12:51,358 --> 00:12:56,601
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to have a running program at the high school that could train kids for a marathon.

191
00:12:57,561 --> 00:13:00,883
[SPEAKER_00]: And I met someone who was already up and running with this program.

192
00:13:00,923 --> 00:13:02,784
[SPEAKER_00]: It started in Newton, Massachusetts.

193
00:13:03,424 --> 00:13:05,205
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I heard all about it.

194
00:13:05,305 --> 00:13:06,886
[SPEAKER_00]: I met this woman who began the program.

195
00:13:06,926 --> 00:13:08,827
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought, we've got to bring this to Medford High.

196
00:13:09,307 --> 00:13:11,608
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started it, I think, four years ago.

197
00:13:11,668 --> 00:13:12,869
[SPEAKER_00]: Medford's been involved.

198
00:13:12,969 --> 00:13:13,830
[SPEAKER_00]: So kids have run.

199
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:17,052
[SPEAKER_00]: three to four Providence-Red Island marathons.

200
00:13:17,092 --> 00:13:18,112
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they train for.

201
00:13:18,553 --> 00:13:28,720
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really believed in the physical fitness, the camaraderie within the group, the health things they learn along the way with hydrating and nutrition.

202
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,742
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just running, there's so many aspects to it.

203
00:13:32,577 --> 00:13:34,098
[SPEAKER_14]: So how do you train for a marathon?

204
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:37,319
[SPEAKER_00]: So you start small.

205
00:13:37,439 --> 00:13:38,860
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the main thing with the kids.

206
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:42,841
[SPEAKER_00]: So the kids start training, and adults, because there are teachers who've been involved.

207
00:13:44,262 --> 00:13:48,164
[SPEAKER_00]: So we start with, at the beginning of October, with a mile.

208
00:13:48,504 --> 00:13:50,805
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do a mile for three days a week.

209
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:56,627
[SPEAKER_00]: And then their first group run, they meet with 10 other high schools on Saturday morning in Brookline.

210
00:13:57,067 --> 00:14:00,749
[SPEAKER_00]: Their first long run with the group is, I think, four to five miles.

211
00:14:01,149 --> 00:14:03,571
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's around the end of October.

212
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:11,836
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, right before the marathon, which is May 1st, in mid-April, they do their long run, which is 21 miles.

213
00:14:12,176 --> 00:14:21,603
[SPEAKER_00]: So they work up from late October, a four miles is their long run, to mid-April, where 21 miles is their long run.

214
00:14:21,923 --> 00:14:23,724
[SPEAKER_00]: But it takes them seven months to get there.

215
00:14:24,925 --> 00:14:25,645
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you so much.

216
00:14:26,186 --> 00:14:26,606
[SPEAKER_14]: Back to you.

217
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:29,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Morell's essay is killing me.

218
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, guys, I hit another teacher!

219
00:14:32,701 --> 00:14:34,481
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm definitely voting him for worst driver.

220
00:14:34,681 --> 00:14:35,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Me too.

221
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:36,542
[SPEAKER_04]: When do we take superlatives?

222
00:14:36,722 --> 00:14:41,203
[SPEAKER_04]: We should start thinking about who we're going to vote for because we're doing them Tuesday, September 22nd in advisory.

223
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:43,504
[SPEAKER_13]: When are we going to take pictures with the senior cars?

224
00:14:43,664 --> 00:14:48,606
[SPEAKER_04]: We should listen to announcements because next week after school we're going to take pictures with the seniors with their own cars.

225
00:14:50,846 --> 00:14:54,027
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, I'm Katrina Rasche.

226
00:14:54,147 --> 00:14:55,468
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm here with the Mustang Report.

227
00:14:55,868 --> 00:14:59,689
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's go over to Amber Harbison at the cross-country race against Arlington Catholic.

228
00:15:57,948 --> 00:15:58,369
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's go!

229
00:15:58,389 --> 00:15:59,569
[SPEAKER_15]: Good work guys!

230
00:16:18,809 --> 00:16:19,129
[SPEAKER_15]: How'd it go?

231
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,171
[SPEAKER_15]: How'd it go, James?

232
00:16:20,511 --> 00:16:23,194
[SPEAKER_15]: Ryan, nice to meet you, Ryan!

233
00:16:23,835 --> 00:16:24,776
[SPEAKER_15]: How's your daddy?

234
00:16:24,796 --> 00:16:27,519
[SPEAKER_15]: Come on, daddy!

235
00:16:27,579 --> 00:16:31,383
[SPEAKER_15]: Nice to meet you, Ryan.

236
00:16:31,604 --> 00:16:32,585
[SPEAKER_15]: Nice work, guys.

237
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:33,186
[SPEAKER_15]: Nice job!

238
00:16:33,206 --> 00:16:35,028
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's go, James!

239
00:16:35,188 --> 00:16:35,949
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

240
00:16:36,009 --> 00:16:37,651
[SPEAKER_15]: Nice job, Kyle!

241
00:16:37,691 --> 00:16:38,832
[SPEAKER_15]: How'd it go, Ivan?

242
00:16:38,912 --> 00:16:39,553
[SPEAKER_15]: How'd it go, John?

243
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:47,196
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's go get it!

244
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:19,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, I'm Lydia Ryan with Channel 15 News and we're here to see some clips from the Kimball Farm outing for the seniors.

245
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:39,272
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, how do I throw it to you?

246
00:17:39,372 --> 00:17:44,853
[SPEAKER_16]: You're gonna fold it up a little bit and get it nice and sitting in your palm.

247
00:17:44,873 --> 00:17:45,893
[SPEAKER_22]: It's all that flick of the wrist.

248
00:17:46,253 --> 00:17:47,733
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, one more, one more.
