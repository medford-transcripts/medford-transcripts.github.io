 Nou pral ale pi bonè pase 8.
 Premye bagay, mwen pral chanje ajanda a yon ti kras paske Janelle ki soti nan KP Law la pou fè kèk fòmasyon sou lalwa reyinyon ouvè.
 Se konsa, nou pral sote entwodiksyon pou moman sa a.
 pou Janelle ka fè rankont ouvè pandan yap antrene paske li gen yon angajman pou dezyèm mwatye rankont sa.
 Se konsa, mwen te vle asire w ke gen ase tan pou li antre sa.
 Men, anvan nou fè sa, mwen jis pral fè yon apèl rapid pou nou, pou dosye a, konnen ki moun ki isit la.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=405.964s">[Austin]</a>:  Sure.
 Thank you so much.
 Can everyone hear me okay?
 Yes.
 Thank you so much for having me this evening.
 Happy to present on this very important topic of the open meeting law.
 I will dive into the public records law a little bit to the extent there's a little bit of overlap.
 I always think it's a good idea to cover these topics.
 Certainly I agree in terms of open meeting law compliance.
 I represent the city of Medford, other communities across the state, and we are seeing a significant uptick in open meeting law compliance.
 So certainly a good opportunity to provide best practices, talk a little bit in terms of
 you know, what your role is in terms of open meeting law compliance, and I understand that some members may be more familiar than others, so I'll try to start with best practices, and I think that's always a good idea.
 If there are certainly any questions after the training,
 or along the way, I think we can feel free to interject.
 I'm an informal person, as many of you know, happy to have this be a conversation.
 If someone feels more comfortable speaking to me after the training, I'm certainly happy to make myself available as well.
 And the mayor has my contact information, happy to provide that.
 I would also start by saying certification is really important.
 So for any member that hasn't already completed their open meeting law certification, I recommend that be done as soon as possible.
 The new Attorney General has put forth a new updated open meeting law guide.
 last year.
 That's available on the Division of Open Government's website.
 I'm happy to circulate the link after this, but in my opinion, if any members are due for their open meeting law certification or for any new members, it's a good idea and certainly required under the open meeting law that that be conducted.
 We are going to cover best practices tonight where this is a public meeting.
 I don't want to go into any specifics or anything that may invoke the open meeting law in a non-confidential way.
 Certainly if there are any questions, happy to follow up afterwards.
 I think I have the ability to share my screen.
 So I wanted to go through the slides that I have.
 And again, if anyone has any particular questions, happy to either interject.
 I won't take offense or go from there.
 Can everyone see the slides okay?
 Great.
 So we're here tonight to talk about the open meeting law.
 I'm gonna talk about best practices.
 I'm gonna go through the sort of fundamentals of the open meeting law.
 We certainly start with the premise that the open meeting law, public records and conflict of interest law throughout the country are really, you know, aimed at government transparency and to eliminate secrecy in terms of the work.
 that you all are doing.
 So we know that under the open meeting law, public bodies such as yourself that are subject to the open meeting law can generally only conduct public business through their public meetings, unless there's a specific exemption applies called an executive session, which would allow you to have a confidential meeting.
 And we'll cover that a little bit further in the training.
 But in essence, the open meeting law regulates the process by which public meetings can be held and conducted.
 And there are really several components to what the open meeting law requires.
 So one, what types of meetings are subject to the law?
 What rules need to be followed to hold a meeting sufficient to give members of the public notice?
 And what are the common violations and why?
 And I think this is always a good idea to cover, again, not to scare anyone or detract from any of the important work that you all are doing, but really just so we're all aware of what the Attorney General's Division of Open Government requires in terms of enforcement, and really to make sure everyone's on the same page with respect to the work and business of the committee.
 The open meeting law addresses four major issues, so I want to cover those in detail.
 And apologies if this is, you know, some information that many of the members may have, but I think it's always a good idea to do a refresher.
 We know that the open meeting law requires notice.
 Essentially, it requires that postings be conducted no more than 48 weekday hours prior to the meeting.
 We know that the
 notice has to be posted in a location accessible 24 hours a day, including the website, and the meeting has to be held in an accessible location under the ADA.
 If you are meeting virtually or in a hybrid format, we can talk about that.
 Certainly, information should be available so members of the public know how to log in at home, and any location that you're meeting in person should be accessible as well.
 We also know that the meeting notice or the agenda should have detailed subject matter items, so we'll talk a little bit about what that means.
 But it's a detailed list of topics that you will all review so that a member of the public can look at that meeting notice at home and say, yes, I'd like to attend the meeting because I know these topics are going to be covered, or no, I'm going to pass on this one and go to the next one.
 someone should be able to say, I understand what this meeting is about and I want to attend this meeting based on what's on the meeting notice.
 We're going to talk a little bit about the nature of the meeting.
 As I mentioned at the beginning, there's a presumption under the open meeting law because of government transparency issues for an open session.
 So the meetings conducted as we're meeting tonight in an open session so members of the public can see in real time
 what the public body is doing, the votes that are being conducted and the deliberation, and we'll talk about what that means, of the body's business and the public business being conducted.
 There are certain pretty narrowly tailored reasons for a closed or an executive session, and we'll talk about the procedures if you do end up meeting in executive session.
 Conduct of the meeting, this is a hot,
 hot topic in recent years, essentially, you know, what rules govern public comment?
 What are the free speech principles that may apply?
 Who gets to speak and when in remote and hybrid meetings?
 So we'll cover that.
 And then the fourth major component of the open meeting law is the meeting minutes themselves.
 Essentially the content of the meeting, detailed enough, similar to a meeting notice to allow someone that wasn't present
 to know what transpired or what took place at the meeting.
 The timing for drafting and approving those meeting minutes, essentially for an open meeting within three meetings or 30 days, whichever is later, is a standard that the Attorney General's Division of Open Government established.
 And we'll talk about the process to do that.
 Most of the public bodies that I work with
 usually have them approved at a, you know, an open meeting of the public body for any meeting minutes, but some decide to designate that task to the chair or to another individual.
 That's a policy decision, but we can talk about that if anyone has any questions on that as well.
 So we'll go through the overview essentially.
 48 hours, I can't tell you how important that is prior to the date of the meeting.
 So certainly to be cognizant of
 legal holidays, vacation schedules, certainly as the summer months come up and there's various holidays in play, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, as well as July 4th, something to be aware of as you schedule meetings that it's 48 weekday hours, not including holidays or weekends.
 The meeting notice should list all the topics with specificity.
 And regardless of whether the meeting was posted correctly,
 We know that the open meeting law says that a meeting occurs whenever a quorum of your public body discusses matters within its jurisdiction.
 So we're gonna spend a lot of time on email practices and text message practices, because I certainly agree with the statement at the beginning of the meeting, that in essence, it's just as important what occurs outside of a public body's meeting under the open meeting law as to what occurs during a meeting.
 So we're gonna talk about pitfalls and some things to be careful of relative to your work.
 And essentially something that I see all the time and to be careful about is that we know that a quorum can be reached regardless of whether an email goes to the entire public body or whether it goes to several members and then it's forwarded to other members.
 So we're gonna talk about that.
 We call that serial communications and it's something with the,
 you know, explosion and all of us use technology all the time.
 It's something to be aware of, certainly, as you serve relative to the open meeting law to not get into a situation where there's deliberation over email or text message or other social media mechanisms.
 Subcommittees, I don't know if you intend to create any subcommittees, but certainly wanting to review that as well as we provide an overview.
 A subcommittee is also subject to the open meeting law.
 The intent to create a subcommittee essentially is not required, and the attorney general will look to determine whether or not the subcommittee is within government, empowered to act collectively in serving a public purpose.
 So generally speaking, unless there's an exception, and we'll talk about that, a subcommittee of your committee is essentially subject to the open meeting law.
 just as the entire compliment would be.
 You know, there are exceptions to that.
 If the mayor created a subcommittee to advise just herself or the superintendent did, where they are not individually subject to the open meeting law, a subcommittee created by them wouldn't be.
 It's a very fact specific analysis.
 So we just wanna be really careful with respect to the creation of subcommittees or working groups or task forces.
 to determine whether or not they are subject to the open meeting law.
 Some practical ways, I try to be practical as many of you know, to avoid violations of the open meeting law.
 One person reporting back to the public body doesn't create a subcommittee.
 And if multiple members are using, doing work on behalf of the public body, you would wanna post a meeting and comply with the open meeting law.
 Any questions so far?
 Okay, I'll continue on.
 Some tips to stay out of trouble.
 And this is all things that I've seen in advising municipalities since 2006 on open meeting law and public records issues.
 So it certainly comes from experience.
 If you are attending a meeting of another public body, school committees, city council,
 the city of Medford.
 Um another.
 I'm sure you're all very involved in the city of Medford and the work that the city does.
 You want to avoid creating the appearance, whether that be at another public bodies meeting or social event or community event.
 Um that you are discussing matters within this public bodies jurisdiction.
 Um I've handled open meeting law complaints or issues over the years where there's an
 or there was a community event and I think that they were talking about X, Y and Z. So certainly you wanna avoid the appearance that you are discussing municipal business.
 To the extent you need to meet jointly with the city council or the school committee or another public body, you can post a joint meeting to be held at the same time and place and then minutes would be prepared just as they would for any other meeting that you may have.
 If you're doing a site visit, certainly,
 best practice may be to send a representative to report back, and then that content is included in the next session's meeting minutes.
 You don't want to be in a position where there's a site visit at a particular location, for instance, that is not accessible.
 And then we're going to spend a lot of time tonight on email, but I can't reiterate this enough to try to avoid the use of email or text messages or social media.
 amongst a quorum of your public body.
 Locations, you're gonna wanna file your meeting notice with the city clerk and they're online as well.
 Some best practices with respect to using your or posting your meeting notice.
 I would recommend not using acronyms or abbreviations.
 Really someone that just moved to the city of Medford should be able to pick it up and say,
 I understand what's going on at this meeting.
 We all that do work with public bodies and public entities understand terms like MSBCA or MSBA, DEP, you know, DEF DESI, but certainly, you know, for the first time, you may want to spell it out just so everyone knows what is being discussed.
 The meeting notice should indicate the date and time of the posting.
 And if you do revise it, I don't know what the practice is going to be.
 You're going to want to include both the date that it was originally drafted and then the revised date as well.
 And that should be done 48 hours, 48 business hours in advance.
 Regularly occurring items do need some more detail than just these examples that I've used.
 What we know from recent determinations from the Division of Open Government is that more detail is better than less detail, so we don't really want to use categories such as new business, old business, or departmental report.
 We really want to specify, for instance, correspondence and list if there's any notable correspondence or
 you know, budget analysis and list any particular reports, for instance, that are going to be done.
 So I would recommend erring on the side of more, not less specificity, which should be helpful to alert members of the public about the exact topics that are going to be discussed.
 Any questions on any of this?
 Great.
 Some practical considerations, and this does come up obviously from time to time, scheduling matters or space limitations.
 Generally, a meeting may not be continued from one night to the next as a matter of course, unless that continuation is posted under the open meeting law.
 So if you couldn't meet tonight, would have to reschedule this meeting and repost it for the new date and time.
 And the notice requirement under the open meeting law doesn't substitute or supersede any other notice requirements if you have them under any other legal requirements.
 So always worth double checking to make sure you're covering any publication notice or anything else that may be required.
 Emergencies.
 I can't tell you how many questions I get regarding emergencies, particularly in the winter months with inclement weather.
 There are very limited instances when a public body can meet without that 48 hours notice that's required.
 Poor planning doesn't equal an emergency.
 We know from determinations of the Attorney General's office.
 So if there was just a mishap with respect to scheduling, and I certainly understand everyone's doing the best they can, and you certainly have a lot of schedules to figure out,
 with respect to the public body's business, but generally an emergency is limited to natural disasters, public health matters, and public safety issues.
 So something to be aware of.
 We can talk a little bit about if something's unanticipated, that's a little bit different, but hosting is really limited in the emergency context.
 If you do have an emergency you really need to meet,
 There's a specific reason why the 48 hours couldn't have been, it couldn't have been posted with the 48 hours.
 You do want to comply with the open meeting law to the extent you can, and really limit deliberations to just that emergency matter.
 You're gonna take meeting minutes of that emergency meeting, and then you'd wanna post a follow-up meeting where you basically ratify the action that was taken at the emergency.
 So let's hope for no emergencies.
 but just wanted to make sure everyone had that information as well.
 Conducting meetings.
 So we're gonna move a little bit from the notice piece of this and the agenda piece of the open meeting law to now how those meetings are conducted.
 These are topics that I often receive a lot of questions about.
 So I just wanted to make sure everyone had the best practices related to these particular topics of the open meeting law.
 We know that
 If the meeting is being recorded, similar to whether it be on Zoom or in person, that there should be a public statement or notification to the public through the technological means that the meeting minute is going to be recorded.
 And the basis of that is the Massachusetts wiretap statute.
 We can't secretly record anyone in Massachusetts.
 If an individual wants to record the meeting on their own, it's not otherwise recorded.
 So if someone shows up to an in-person meeting, it used to be when I started doing this, it would be the big, you know, the big recording device with a tripod that we had the old VCR tapes for.
 Now, of course, it's iPhones.
 The individual must inform the chair of their intent to do the recording.
 And then the chair would make the required announcement to the public body
 members as well as members of the public indicating that the meeting was going to be recorded.
 In my opinion, the chair can decide to reasonably regulate the recording placement.
 Obviously, as technology is smaller and smaller, this is less of an issue, but we don't want to block anyone's view, so to speak.
 And people can be in a position where they're not interrupting or there's no disorderly conduct in the meeting themselves.
 Any questions on recordings?
 Nope.
 Okay, thank you.
 Email.
 I would say, I'm going to try to do the math here.
 70 to 80% of the open meeting law complaints that I deal with relate to the use of email, text messages, or other social media mechanisms.
 So I say that again, we all use technology, it's efficient, it's quick,
 It garners a quick response and certainly, I'm sure you all use it, you know, in your other lives, professional lives, personal lives.
 But really, the open meeting law does not encourage the use of email or other text messages by members of the public body to conduct their business.
 Email is explicitly addressed in the open meeting law, and it is often the reason I see for a violation to be determined by the Attorney General's office.
 And what the law requires is that a quorum, either collectively, so reply all situation, or, you know, a group of individuals or one individual forwards it to another who forwards another, can constitute an open meeting law violation.
 Members should really be cautious and a best practice would be not to use email to share ideas, beliefs, opinions, concerns, whether serially or in a single email regarding business.
 And you can't use another member to, you can't send an email to a non-public body member to then circulate out to the group as well.
 Some practical approaches, certainly beware to reply all on emails and really limit
 the use of email to scheduling purposes only and try to avoid using it to undertake business.
 We should always assume that emails could be forwarded to, you know, a local blogger, put on Facebook, sent to the newspaper.
 I've seen it before.
 So we really want to be very considerate of the use of email.
 And this is where there is the overlap with the public records law
 because even if you're volunteers, emails or text messages or social media posts that are made in your official capacity or in relation to your service on this committee really are subject to the public records law as well.
 And so if you use a Gmail account or a personal cell phone to send an email or a text message, and there is a public records request for that,
 that certainly would be subject to the public records law, most likely.
 So just something to be very cognizant of as you begin your service.
 Is there a question?
 No, I think we're good.
 Okay, great.
 Thank you.
 Texting and social media, texting and social media, similar, also subject to the open meeting law.
 Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, Reddit, all of those are subject to the public records law and the open meeting law to the extent there is deliberation.
 If you are a user of social media, certainly in your individual capacity, you have free speech and first amendment considerations.
 So I'm not gonna speak directly to your individual rights, but certainly some practical approaches if you are posting on your service, you don't wanna direct comments to your other members,
 And if a matter directly involves issues pending, you might wanna consider not engaging.
 Certainly again, be thoughtful about the comments that are made and consider using separate accounts if you do run for something.
 Remember that applicants or any individual before you has due process rights.
 So certainly something to be cognizant of as well.
 The open meeting law,
 does not mandate, we're gonna talk a little bit about the authority of the chair in public comment, does not mandate that any particular person be allowed to speak at a meeting.
 So that's something we've seen a particular uptick in, both with respect to First Amendment auditors across the state, and also I'll talk a little bit about a case that came out last year that is really important.
 The open meeting law doesn't require that you even allow public participation or public comment, though I certainly understand that most public bodies do.
 The open meeting law indicates that the chair essentially has the sole discretion as to who may speak and for how long.
 So comments are directed through the chair, as you know.
 And while public comment isn't required under the open meeting law,
 allowing the public to speak during your meeting or restricting any speech, other than based on time, place, and manner restrictions, and we'll talk about what that means, does have serious constitutional implications.
 So certainly if you do allow public comment,
 all of the decisions as to who's going to speak or for how long should be content neutral.
 So not based on the particular message for a speaker or what that individual says, but just based on the time that's allotted.
 Some public bodies I work with say 15 minutes of public comment, everyone gets two or three minutes, people are allowed to speak once or twice depending on how busy the agenda is.
 And some have adopted public comment policies as well.
 So certainly something to put out there to all of you to consider.
 And we'll talk a little bit more about public comment, but the chair does have the authority to regulate it subject to those constitutional restrictions.
 Public participation, whether or not to allow public participation is a significant policy decision.
 here are a couple of factors for all of you to consider.
 When will the public participation period occur?
 Is it going to be at the beginning of the meeting?
 Is it going to be in the middle of the meeting or at the end of the meeting?
 How long will it be?
 You know, like I said, 10, 15 minutes is usually what I see, but there are some meetings where warrants particular input from members of the public.
 And so you all may decide a half an hour or an hour
 We just want to make sure it's equal across the board for anyone that wants to speak.
 How long will each person be allowed to speak and whether or not each person can speak more than once.
 So conducting the meeting, policy issues for public comment periods, any rules about public participation must relate to the process.
 such participation and cannot relate to any speech protected by constitutional principles.
 Any restrictions on an individual's speech must be narrowly tailored.
 So again, try to give some practical advice here, items to consider.
 During a public comment period, you certainly want to avoid a debate to the extent you can.
 You want to avoid responding before you've had the time or opportunity to discuss it or if the matter is controversial.
 And it is perfectly fine, both under the open meeting law, as well as under constitutional considerations, to just leave matters raised during public comment unresolved.
 They're not on the meeting agenda itself.
 And so it may be something that you decide to put on a
 a future meeting agenda so that members, the public that may be interested in the topic can come to the next meeting and say, okay, this is going to be reviewed.
 We're going to have an open discussion.
 We're going to be able to deliberate on it.
 So some practical items to consider there.
 Matters not reasonably anticipated by the chair that are going to be discussed by all of you must be added to the agenda.
 after the posting deadline to the extent feasible.
 And I'll give an example of that.
 If you are going to designate a staff member or someone else to work on your agenda, you wanna make sure that that person understands that it has to be added as soon as possible.
 And like we had talked about at the beginning with respect to the meeting notice, the updated agenda should show the original date as well as the date that it was changed.
 Matters not reasonably anticipated by the chair may be discussed and acted upon, but the Attorney General's Office does recommend, unless it requires immediate attention, it really should be put off to a later meeting and included in that meeting posting.
 So it really is, was this matter so time-sensitive, but yet unanticipated that it had to be discussed at this meeting?
 We updated the meeting agenda,
 and we're going to essentially discuss it, or can we put it off to the next meeting because it isn't time sensitive and it really could have been anticipated based on the totality of the circumstances.
 Any questions on any of that?
 I know it's a lot of content.
 Anything from any of the members?
 Looks like we're good so far.
 Okay, thank you so much.
 Meeting minutes, I don't know if you've all determined how the meeting minutes will be prepared or created and approved, but wanted to make sure, and I'll make these slides available to anyone that wants them after the meeting.
 I'll certainly circulate them so you have them as well as some other materials that may be helpful as a little open meeting log guide.
 The date, time, and place of the meeting and members present and absent does need to be included.
 You know, I get this question all the time.
 Are the meeting minutes a transcript?
 And the answer is no.
 What we know is it doesn't need to be a verbatim transcript of what transpired, particularly as I would imagine you're going to have longer meetings from time to time.
 What the attorney general's office has said and what the open meeting law requires is that it has to have a detailed summary of the discussion of each topic so that a member of the public sitting at home that goes to the website and looks at meeting minutes once they're drafted and approved says, okay, I understand what happened at this meeting, right?
 I understand this was the topic discussed.
 This is the general nature of the discussion.
 These were the votes that were taken.
 Here are the next steps.
 It can't be very cursory, but at the same time, it doesn't need to be a verbatim transcript.
 We do know that it should have the decisions made, any actions taken, and any votes recorded.
 You all did proper roll call vote at the beginning.
 If you are meeting in a remote capacity, you do want to do a roll call vote, and we'll talk about that in a little bit as well.
 The meeting minutes should also reference any documents or other exhibits that you use or consider during a meeting.
 They don't need to be attached to the meeting minutes, but we just want to reference them so that if there is a public records request or a request for those meeting minutes and all materials that you use during the meeting, someone can go back and figure out what was discussed and put the package together to then send to a member of the public.
 Meeting minutes do need to be approved and drafted in a timely manner.
 We know that that requires under the current regulations that that approval has to transpire within the next three meetings or within 30 days, whichever is later.
 There are several determinations that talk about, you know, staffing constraints or operational constraints alone aren't really a good reason for a delay in those approval of the meeting minutes.
 Certainly things happen.
 Everyone's busy and people are doing the best they can.
 My general advice and best practice is to try to stay on top of the drafting and approval of the meeting minutes as best as you can, given your other responsibilities.
 A question has come up very frequently in the last couple of years, can a public body use Google Docs or another document sharing mechanism to edit
 edit the meeting minutes in advance of a meeting to make that a more efficient process.
 And generally that is not allowed under the Open Meeting Law because if several members are going into Google Docs and sharing their comments outside of a public meeting, that could constitute a deliberation.
 It can be delegated, this task, to one individual.
 It's a matter of policy in terms of how you want to handle it in terms of efficiency, but there are different methods, so if you have any questions on that, feel free to let me know, and I'm happy to walk through it.
 Meeting minutes are
 Minutes of open meetings are public records as of the moment of their creation, regardless of whether they've been approved.
 So draft meeting minutes are subject to the public records law, just as approved meeting minutes are.
 Certainly personal notes, so if you take personal notes that are not shared as part of the public body's official files or the school department's files or the city's files, those are personal to you.
 And I would argue those are exempt under the public records law.
 But the meeting minutes, even in draft form, would be subject to disclosure.
 And there is a slightly shorter timeframe for a request for meeting minutes under the open meeting law.
 It's 10 calendar days.
 For a public records request response, it's 10 business days.
 So I just wanted to make sure you had that information as well.
 Executive session minutes.
 I don't know how much you all will meet an executive session, but certainly wanted to make sure everyone was aware of what an executive session is and how those meeting minutes differ from open session meeting minutes.
 The open meeting law allows public bodies to meet an executive or confidential session
 for specific reasons, those are all spelled out in Chapter 30A, Section 21.
 And I have many handouts on this.
 If anyone wants it, feel free to let me know.
 Happy to share it with all of you.
 Basically, if you all meet in executive session, either for litigation or real estate reasons, or there's a particular complaint, those are the most common reasons to go into executive session.
 There are specific requirements that apply.
 There must be notice.
 There need to be roll call votes.
 And those meeting minutes as opposed to the open session meeting minutes are confidential so long as that executive session purpose applies or there may be another reason to keep them confidential even after they're released under the public records law.
 Essentially, executive session meeting minutes can be withheld until that purpose has been met
 unless they're protected under the public records law.
 And the most common example of that is if you were meeting regarding, you know, threatened litigation or litigation that you were involved in, I hope that never happens, under Purpose 3 of the open meeting law, and you had counsel advising you at that meeting, the litigation settles, the, you know, there's no threat of litigation, all of that goes away.
 but the meeting minutes themselves may be able to be redacted under the attorney client privilege.
 So there is a little bit of overlap there with respect to the open meeting law process and the public records process.
 So just want to make sure everyone knew that.
 If you do meet an executive session, the open meeting law requires the chair or the chair's designee to review executive session meeting minutes routinely.
 I usually recommend quarterly just to see, can the meeting minutes be released?
 Has the purpose expired or not?
 And so that, to get in the habit of doing that, if you do end up meeting in executive session, I think is very helpful as things progress.
 Same timeframe in terms of a response, the 10 calendar days as well.
 Not that you need to release them, but just that a response be provided.
 Any questions on that so far?
 Nope, we're good.
 Thank you.
 I just want to check in every once in a while just to make sure.
 Executive sessions, if you do meet an executive session, you're going to first convene an open session.
 This question comes up all the time.
 Well, we're just having an executive session, Janelle.
 Like, what do you mean?
 Well, you have an open session, you start, and then the public sees you vote to go into executive session.
 That's what the open meeting law requires.
 You're going to announce the purpose of the executive session without compromising the reason.
 You know, this comes up more often, I would say, for land use boards, for instance, but if you had, if there was a threat of litigation and you didn't want to impact that at all, certainly may decide as a matter of policy, we can't discuss this.
 So something to be aware of.
 You're going to take and record a roll call to vote to go into executive session.
 and announce publicly whether or not you're going to return an open session or reconvene at all.
 Exhibits and documents are going to, again, be stored in reasonable proximity to the minutes so that we understand what the record of the meeting, what happened at the meeting, what transpired, and really only, I can't stress this enough, discuss the matters that are cited.
 So if you do feel as if you have a reason to go into executive session to discuss things secretly,
 And again, they're very narrow for the reasons you can do this.
 You really only wanna discuss those matters.
 You don't want the conversation of we are in a different direction that should be discussed in open session because I have dealt with open meeting law complaints alleging that when the minutes are released, everyone can see there was an open discussion of something else.
 So really be cognizant that you're only talking about what you can talk about in executive session.
 And again, it's 38 section 21, and the open meeting raw guide that I can circulate after this meeting goes through all of that in detail and there's a very helpful checklist that I have as well that I'm happy to provide to the committee as they conduct as you all conduct your work.
 I do get this question quite often, so I wanted to make sure you all knew.
 If an executive session is anticipated, it does need to be listed in appropriate detail on the meeting notice, again, without compromising your position, and the vote to enter into executive session must also be listed as well.
 You know, it's often that
 You have an open meeting and someone will say, well, can we go into executive session now?
 And the answer is most likely not.
 The same posting requirements apply unless there's an emergency or unanticipated item.
 So I wanted to cover, before we go into questions, and I'm happy to answer any questions that anyone has, a little bit of the enforcement process, just so you're all aware of it in case this ever comes up, and I hope it doesn't.
 You know, step one is if there was an open meeting law complaint that a written complaint be filed, there's a specific form within 30 days that someone found out about the alleged violation.
 And then from there, the public body would review the complaint, discuss a response and issue a response to the complainant along with any action that was taken.
 The complainant can essentially be satisfied and not do anything else and say, I'm completely content.
 with how the committee responded, or alternatively, they can say, I want further review with the Attorney General's Office.
 And the Attorney General's Office has a specific division, the Division of Open Government, that is charged specifically with enforcement of the open meeting law.
 There's a director of that division and several attorneys, and they essentially review open meeting law complaints to determine whether or not a violation has occurred.
 There are a variety of options.
 If there is a violation that the AG's office has, they can nullify the action that's taken.
 There are fines that can be imposed for intentional violations.
 There is also the option to go to court to seek further relief if an individual wants to.
 And then three registered voters can also bring an action in superior court.
 You know, I think the bottom line here is to really take those best practices and try to employ them to the extent you can.
 And if there's any questions along the way, better to ask at the beginning than to let it go further than that.
 Any questions so far?
 Nope.
 Nope, I think we're good.
 Okay, thank you.
 So I wanted to cover some recent notable court decisions.
 I've given a long summary here just so everyone has them.
 I think really the takeaway is the Barron case is a huge case that was recently decided by the SJC, the Supreme Judicial Court, which is the highest state court in the Commonwealth.
 And that really dealt with public comment periods.
 And essentially, in summary, the court held that while
 Municipalities are not required to provide public comments during board and committee meetings.
 If you are required to do so, they have to comply with the provisions of the constitution.
 So after this decision in South Borough, and I encourage you to all read it if you're interested, and I have a copy if anyone wants it, in my opinion, care should really be taken that any public comment period, like we talked about a couple of slides back,
 is limited to these reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions, rather than mandating quote-unquote civility or other content-based restrictions.
 You know, certainly this was a trend since the court reviewed this Corey Spaulding case versus Town of Natick School Committee back in 2018.
 closely tracked that case and the ACLU was involved in that litigation.
 That also dealt with public comments during public meetings where there were allegations the committee improperly limited comments made by members of the public, which were critical of the committee, but allowed other individuals to speak.
 If we look at these cases together, essentially, I think it makes sense to have a public comment policy or consistency across the board with respect to time,
 but regulation of content is really problematic in light of these decisions.
 So if there are specific questions of that, as you begin to conduct your business, certainly let me know.
 I'm happy to analyze that.
 I've worked on a lot of public comment policies since the Barron decision was decided.
 So happy to answer any questions that anyone has on that.
 I think practically speaking, most people do the time restrictions
 for public comment period and decide where in the meeting they're going to have public comment based on their other businesses, business for that meeting.
 I've included reference to two other cases.
 The Town of Swansea case was about sufficiency of meeting minutes.
 So I wanted to make sure you all had that as well.
 And then the Bolter versus Whelan case was really, and I don't know how much this would impact your work, but really dealt with employee evaluation processes.
 The current state of the open meeting law.
 So we know that the COVID-19 pandemic era changes are in place until March 31st, 2025.
 They were extended by Governor Healey in a supplemental budget bill that further extended those temporary measures.
 They were put in place in 2020 and extended several times.
 I just wanted to alert all of you that there is also significant pending legislation that would either seek to extend this further or make modifications to the open meeting law.
 I haven't heard it moving quickly at the state level, but certainly will keep
 All of you updated along the way, if there are changes, we would update, certainly update you, but for now, you can meet entirely in person, you can meet entirely remotely, or you can meet in a hybrid format.
 You know, I think instead of holding meetings in a public place, you can provide adequate alternative means, and we'll talk about what that means.
 Public body members can also participate in meetings remotely as well.
 The changes are still optional,
 There are technological considerations, we'll talk about that, but essentially the 2020 changes that were in place remain in effect through at least March 31st, 2025.
 And I would imagine there'll be further action on those in the next six months.
 Adequate alternative access, what does that mean?
 It means that if you are providing, if you are meeting remotely,
 you have to provide real-time access.
 A lag of about 20 seconds or so is deemed acceptable, but if there is a technical problem that prevents the meeting from being accessible, the stream crashes, the meeting should be paused or rescheduled depending on the severity of the technical issue.
 So there have been multiple determinations that
 The attorney general's office has held that continuing a meeting and posting a recording afterwards does not cure a violation if the meeting is fully remote.
 The public must be able to access the meeting as it happens.
 And again, this is if there's a remote meeting.
 If you're meeting entirely in person and you're providing a courtesy link or it's being live streamed as this is on,
 know Medford community then that requirement would not apply in my opinion.
 Zoom as we're here tonight is the typical means but it's not required.
 Any method that allows the public to follow in real time is acceptable in light of the remote meeting requirements.
 Additional considerations if you are meeting remotely
 you have to make a public statement that the meeting is being recorded, again, under the wiretap requirements.
 Votes should be taken with a roll call, just as we do in an executive session, and remote meeting, remote members, so if there are some people in person and there are some people at home, you must introduce yourselves or be introduced at the meeting, and the camera should be on to the extent that
 someone can have their camera on and they're not participating by phone or for medical reasons, they can't participate with their camera on or they've requested an accommodation.
 When holding an executive session remotely, members of the public body should state that no other person is present, that no one else can hear them.
 Again, that goes to the confidential nature of an executive session.
 And so if we were here tonight, I would say, you know, just so you know, I'm here in a room with the door shut in my office and no one else can hear me.
 That would be sufficient.
 Hybrid meetings.
 Many, I would say the majority of public bodies I work with are meeting in a remote or hybrid manner.
 You can allow
 your members to meet in person, but members of the public can watch a live stream.
 And you can also allow direct participants.
 So if you had a contractor or an engineer or a project manager to attend in person, but the general public could meet remotely.
 And a member may attend remotely if even if other members attend in person.
 The bottom line is essentially if live access stops,
 then the meeting must stop as well.
 If there is troubleshooting or technical difficulties, you do want to be careful, again, not to deliberate over text or email if there is an issue with a technical feed.
 And you can resume the meeting once it's resolved and members of the public are allowed to see the live stream again.
 Public body must be able to hear and follow the meeting from their remote location.
 Okay, so that was a little bit of a, I know a lot of information to take in.
 I'm happy to answer any specific questions that anyone has.
 As I had mentioned, I'm happy to share both these slides as well as additional resources as a open meeting law training kit with all of you and happy to answer any questions along the way.
 and update you with respect to the legislation on the open meeting law changes that may or may not go into effect by the end of next March.

 Mwen t ap travay nan ansyen Brooks-Hobbs yo lè nou te fè tranzisyon soti la nan nouvo bibliyotèk McGlynn.
 Apre dezan apre, mwen te fè tranzisyon nan nouvo Brooks School Library.
 Ak nan 2010, mwen te fè tranzisyon nan ansyen lekòl segondè a, ki te byen yon chòk.
 Men, ou konnen, lè nou t ap pase nan pwosesis konstriksyon pou lòt lekòl yo, mwen pa t nan komite a, men mwen te patisipe nan kèk nan walkthroughs nan lòt bilding yo.
 Apre sa, mwen te gade evènman sa yo chak semèn Jack Buckley ak alè ak nan bidjè.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=3948.703s">[Graham]</a>: Mwen se Jenny Graham.
 Mwen se prezidan gwoup 25 sa a.
 Se konsa, mèsi paske ou isit la.
 Mwen gen de timoun nan lekòl yo.
 Mwen panse ke yo tou de ka rate pwojè sa a anvan li sou entènèt.
 Men, mwen te fè anpil pwomès nan kay la, kidonk isit la nou ye.
 Men, mwen vrèman ap tann sa a.
 Nan travay mwen an, mwen posede yon konpayi konsiltasyon jesyon.
 Mwen fè anpil travay ak amelyorasyon pwosesis, konsepsyon aprantisaj granmoun ak livrezon, ansanm ak jesyon pwojè.
 Se konsa, mwen se yon manadjè pwojè sètifye, pa nan konstriksyon, men mwen konnen ki jan yo deplase yon gwo gwoup moun nan yon objektif.
 E se sa mwen la poum fè.
 Se konsa, anpil nan bagay sa yo ke Janelle te pale sou yo se sòt de wòl pou mwen pran sou tèm minit yo.
 Epi nou pral pale sou tout bagay sa yo nan bon tan.
 Men, mwen jis tèlman kontan ou tout isit la.
 Nou gen anpil travay pou nou fè.
 Epi nou te aktyèlman fè yon kantite lajan fòmidab nan travay.
 E mon vreman kontan pour dir ou sa.
 Se konsa, nou pral rive nan sa jis osito ke nou fini entwodiksyon.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=4011.26s">[Preisner]</a>: Luke Preissner, paran twa timoun nan sistèm lekòl la.
 Pi gran an se setyèm ane Andrews la, epi answit sè l la toujou nan Roberts la, epi ti frè l la toujou nan Roberts la.
 Mwen panse mwen ta karakterize tèt mwen kòm yon paran ki enterese ak anpil motive pou amelyore anviwònman lekòl segondè a pou nou ka evite nenpòt chwa difisil pita.
 Mwen panse, ou konnen, petèt mwen jwenn hyper konsantre sou bagay sa yo.
 Se konsa, mwen fè anpil rechèch, kèk bèl
 Mwen pa ta di abitye, men mwen konnen ki jan efò konplèks sa yo ka tonbe nan ray yo epi pran pi lontan pase sa yo ta dwe.
 Se konsa, ou konnen, pwofesyonèl, mwen se yon enjenyè sistèm.
 Mwen travay nan endistri ayewospasyal, abitye ak konpleksite ak atansyon sou pwosesis.
 Sètènman, ou konnen, mwen panse ke wòl mwen pral jis petèt mande kèk
 soti nan bwat kesyon yo.
 Mwen konnen nou gen anpil moun isit la ki swa travay dirèkteman pou lekòl yo oswa ki gen kèk koneksyon solid ak distri lekòl la.
 E alor petet mon ava vwar en problenm an partikilye dan en lot perspektiv e mon ava donn son lavwa.
 Petèt li pral pwodiktif.
 Petèt li pral jis yon bagay ki se yon moso nan espageti ki glise sou miray la.
 Men, mwen panse ke se wòl mwen isit la, yon kalite wòl deyò, men sètènman motive yo pote yon nouvo lekòl segondè nan Medford.
 Mèsi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=4126.107s">[Maxwell]</a>: Alo, mwen se Fiona Maxwell, Ofisye anchèf akizisyon pou vil Medford.
 Li bon pou w wè anpil non yo.
 Mwen jis reyalize mwen pa janm wè figi ou.
 Men, mwen te nan Biwo Akizisyon pou Vil Medford pou sèt ane kounye a, e sa a se yon gwo opòtinite.
 Gen anpil bon bagay k ap pase nan vil Medford, e mwen pa soti nan Medford, kidonk mwen kontan ak eksite ak tout pwojè k ap fèt yo.
 Se yon gwo bagay.
 Mwen menm mwen soti nan yon kominote kote nou te bati yon nouvo lekòl segondè, lekòl mwayen, tounen nan 2015, e mwen te sòt nan lòt bout la.
 Mwen te plis kontak la, epi mwen te travay pou vil North Reading, men nan yon kapasite diferan.
 Apre sa, mwen ka di se te yon pwojè ekselan, yon gwo sistèm lekòl, ak pitit fi mwen an se te premye klas la gradye, ak pitit gason m nan te gradye nan la tou.
 Mwen ap tann pou pote, Medford merite li.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=4193.234s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Breanna Lungo-Koehn, Majistra Medford.
 Mwen vle remèsye tout moun paske yo te isit la epi remèsye Jenny paske li te pran latèt nan tout travay li te fè.
 Mwen gen twa timoun, de nan lekòl piblik yo, youn ki ka jwenn yon ane oswa de oswa twa, men nenpòt fason, mwen jis tèlman eksite pou kòmanse pwosesis sa a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=4209.719s">[Desmond]</a>: Alo, mwen se Marissa Desmond.
 Mwen se yon achitèk.
 Mwen travay sitou nan anviwònman kanpis la, yon anpil nan edikasyon siperyè, men menm jan an tou yon ti kras nan K jiska 12.
 Mwen te konsantre majorite sou pwogramasyon yo ak pòsyon konsepsyon konseptyèl byen bonè nan pwojè yo, men mwen te swiv anpil nan menm konsèp nan tout wout la nan konstriksyon tou.
 Mwen gen de timoun piti, twa ak senk ane, kidonk mwen vrèman eksite
 gen yon nouvo lekòl pou yo alavni.
 Fè yon pati nan pwosesis la.
 Epitou, anvan mwen te kòmanse edikasyon ak karyè achitekti mwen, mwen te anseye matematik setyèm ane pou yon ti kras.
 Se konsa, pou yon ti kras tan sa a, tou.
 Mwen jis vrèman eksite.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=4261.865s">[Cabral]</a>: Marta Cabral, direktè lekòl segondè isit la nan Metro Chi.
 Mwen se yon ansyen pwofesè.
 Mwen te yon AP tou.
 E sa se premye wòl prensipal mwen.
 Se konsa, mwen santi mwen trè beni pou m kapab ede konstwi yon nouvo lekòl nan premye ane mwen isit la pou elèv nou yo, paske yo vrèman merite li.
 Mwen gen zewo bilding background, zewo travay achitekti, zewo anyen ke nou tout gen kòm ekspètiz.
 Men, sa mwen ka fè se mwen ka imajine ki kalite espas elèv yo, pwofesè yo ak anplwaye nou yo bezwen isit la nan Medford High School.
 Apre sa, mwen vrèman eksite fè sa, paske mwen panse ke nou ka reyèlman
 fè zegwi a avanse nan enstriksyon lè w kreye espas ki kolaborasyon ak inovatè.
 Se konsa, mwen kontan yo dwe isit la ak di ou mèsi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=4312.083s">[Hodgdon]</a>: Mwen se Lori Hodgdon.
 Mwen se direktè lekòl la koupe direktè otobis Curtis, pwobableman bilding ki pi ansyen an.
 Sètènman.
 Mwen vrèman renmen ansyen achitekti lekòl, renmen Curtis Bus, men konnen ke li pa fèt pou elèv yo.
 Se konsa, mwen vrèman eksite pou m te yon pwofesè lekòl segondè, yon direktè nan Vermont, yon direktè nan Western Mass, North Shore, epi answit yon lekòl endepandan.
 Mwen te toujou sou swa fen nan ke nan yon pwojè bilding oswa goumen pou li.
 Mwen te yon etidyan nan Middlebury, Vermont epi mwen te wè sa k ap pase.
 Nou tout te mete bòt ak frè m nan te rive rekòlte benefis nouvo bilding lan.
 Mwen santi mwen te toujou nan kòmansman an
 oswa nan fen yon bagay.
 E mwen panse ke li vrèman enteresan.
 Mwen panse ke kapasite a, se pa tout vil oswa vil yo rive bati yon nouvo bilding lekòl ak panse sou lavni an, espesyalman ak elèv yo ke mwen ap travay ak kounye a, ki gen aksè an tèm de ekite ak kalite kapital kiltirèl ak resous pou nou an. elèv yo, mwen panse ke li pral vrèman enpòtan.
 Mwen te renmen sa Jenny te di, jan de ko-lokalizasyon, oswa nenpòt moun ki te vini, mwen renmen sa, nan panse sou elèv Curtis Tech nou yo reyèlman fè pati nan twal la nan bilding sa a ap vanse.
 Yo merite li.</p>

 Apre sa, mwen te ale nan gam la nan pwofesè, lidè ekip evalyasyon, koòdonatè, e kounye a nan pozisyon sa a.
 Mwen te gen tou de pitit gason ki te gradye nan Medford Public Schools.
 Youn te ale nan wout kolèj, youn te ale pwofesyonèl.
 Kidonk, mwen vrèman kontan pou m wè vizyon nouvo lekòl segondè sa a ak sa li ka pote pou Medford ak elèv nou yo, men tou pou m wè sa Laurie te di, ekite ak aksè pou tout elèv nou yo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=4444.261s">[Galusi]</a>: Alo, mwen se Susanne Kalusi.
 Sa a se 27yèm ane mwen.
 Se konsa, mwen menm tou, mwen te fèt ak leve soti vivan nan Medford, youn nan lekòl mwen pi renmen.
 Mwen pa rete isit la ankò, men tout karyè mwen te isit la.
 Mwen te kòmanse kòm yon pwofesè ak asistan direktè, lidè lekòl nan Brooks, ak asistan sipèentandan pou lekòl elemantè, e kounye a, asistan sipèentandan pou akademik ak konstriksyon.
 Menm jan ak kalite pyès Marta a, mwen vrèman kontan pou m travay avèk nou tout pou vizyon ansèyman lekòl yo.
 Mwen panse ke kòm yon moun ki te Maria te pale yon ti kras sou li.

 Se konsa, mwen santi mwen te yon kalite viv tou de bò sa a yon ti kras, men mwen te beni ase

 Se konsa, mwen panse ke wòl enpòtan ke nou tout jwe, desizyon sa yo ki pral gen enpak sou edikatè nou yo, elèv nou yo, fanmi nou yo, kominote nou an, trè enpòtan pou mwen, kidonk mwen pran

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=4542.64s">[Parkinson]</a>: Mèsi.
 Bonswa Marisa Parkinson.
 Mwen menm tou, mwen te fèt nan lari a nan Lawrence.
 Fanmi mwen, manman mwen toujou isit la nan lari a nan West Medford.
 Apre sa, mwen te kòmanse lekòl nan Medford.
 Mwen te kòmanse nan yon lekòl bonè.
 Mwen te ale nan yon lòt chemen.
 Mwen te fini nan St.
 Ray ak Casey.
 Mwen twò Katolik, men ou konnen, mwen te travay nan Johnny's Foodmaster nan Westlake.
 Devil Park te pak lokal mwen an.
 Epi ou konnen, mwen renmen lekòl.
 Mwen renmen timoun yo.
 Mwen renmen edikasyon.
 Mwen te nan edikasyon kounye a pou 30 ane.
 Se konsa, sa se trè pè, paske mwen te tankou 29.
 Se tankou repons mwen ale nan.
 Se konsa, mwen panse mwen pral oblije fè yon ajisteman.
 Men, mwen vrèman eksite sou sa sa vle di.
 Jwenn yon nouvo lekòl segondè pou Medford.
 Mwen konnen nan epòk kote bilding sa a te bati, li te tankou, ou konnen, pwobableman tankou Taj Mahal.
 Se te yon bèl lekòl segondè.
 Men, ou konnen, 50 plis ane pita, nou bezwen yon bagay nouvo.
 E mwen santi elèv nou yo merite sa.
 Epi nou gen bèl pwogram pwofesyonèl.
 Nou gen bèl pwogram akademik, men nan yon bilding trè ansyen.
 Epi nou gen yon bèl pwogram Curtis House, ki sitiye nan yon lòt etablisman.
 Nou gen bèl opsyon pou timoun piti ak pwogram preskolè nou an pou anplwaye ki loje isit la.
 Epi nou gen chans genyen bagay sa yo nan Medford.
 Apre sa, mwen jis santi tankou Medford se ti bijou sa a.
 Epi gen yon nouvo lekòl segondè prensipal pral fè anpil pou elèv nou yo, pou kominote a, ak pou avni kominote nou an an jeneral, pi gwo kominote a.
 Apre sa, mwen jis gade pou pi devan pou fè pati pwosesis sa a ak travay ak tout moun ki isit la epi pran diferan eksperyans mwen yo
 ou konnen, ajoute vwa mwen ak tout vwa ki deja isit la.
 Ak majistra a ak manm Graham, ou konnen, rive nan gwoup 25 sa a, te gen anpil kandida bèl kalifye ke li te tankou yon lòt enjenyè, yon lòt achitèk.
 Men, pou li ale nan gwoup sa a nan renmen
 moun bèl bagay.
 Mwen trè, trè rekonesan.
 Mwen vle rele Luke ki te kòmanse pwosesis la avèk nou de ane de sa, mwen panse.
 Epi, ou konnen, te pandye nan la epi li te toujou tcheke nan.
 Donk, mwen jis ap tann pwosesis sa a epi jis reyèlman vle nou rete pozitif ak optimis sou sa ki pral vini.
 Ak manm Ramjani, mwen pa konnen si ou vle pataje ak yo sou pwomnad la.
 ke ou te pran ak ki jan eksitan kèk nan nou te pran ak ki jan enteresan sa ki te.
 Epi li pral menm plis enteresan pou rès ekip la ale epi fè eksperyans sa yo menm jan an.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=4748.33s">[Graham]</a>:  Sure.
 Thank you all for the...
 words of excitement.
 I want to do a couple of things between now and 8pm and we're going to be out the door at 8, I promise.
 But just as a quick time check, two big things.
 One is I want to give you a bit of a sense of what's been happening.
 to lead up to today and where we are in the process.
 So I'm going to talk a little bit about that.
 We're going to bring up a quick presentation to do that.
 And then before we leave tonight, we will form some subcommittees so that we can move quickly on some of the near-term work that we need to do.
 So we'll talk about that in just a minute.
 But Peter, if you can bring up that presentation for me, that would be great.
 OK.
 You can go ahead a couple of pages.
 Keep going, one more.
 Here we go.
 Back in February, we started, so in December, the MSBA invited us to the eligibility period.
 And we'll talk about what the eligibility period means in just a couple of minutes.
 But that invitation said, you're invited to this process, which starts on May 1st.
 So tomorrow we start.
 However, the committee named me the chair of this building committee back in February, and there's a lot of work that has been done so far.
 One of the things that we had to do was find all of you, right?
 So in the context of trying to say, what is it that we want as a school committee for this building committee to do, we established a list of goals.
 There's going to be many, many more goals, but I did want to set the stage of,
 the work that we're going to do for the next five to seven years.
 The first is to plan comprehensively for all programming currently residing on the Medford High School campus, including vocational and non-vocational 9-to-12 education, 9-to-12 athletics, the Medford Family Network, Medford Community Schools programming, early childhood education, including, but not limited to, the Medford Early Education Program, which we call MEAP, and Kids' Corner.
 So there's so much more that goes on in this building than what we think about when we think about a high school.
 So that's one thing for you all to start to think about.
 Number two, what's that?
 Can I take it?
 Oh yeah, and I can share the slides.
 No, no, I can share the slides.
 Yeah, I can share all the slides with you afterwards.
 Number two is to consider whether the placement of Curtis Tufts High School on the Medford campus will provide increased educational opportunities to enrolled students at Curtis Tufts.
 Number three, ensure robust public input and stakeholder feedback and appropriate milestones throughout the project that complies with MSBA guidelines and guidance from the Medford School Committee.
 Listen to educator and administrator input regarding the future of educational best practices and plans for the students of Medford.
 That means we care a lot about functionality.
 So we wanna know that the spaces will work for the students and the teachers in the building.
 It's really, really important.
 Number five, create plans for the building that advances Medford's climate goals and achieves any CHIPS and LEED 5, LEED version 5 certification to meet the Paris Climate Accords 2030 and 2050 targets, and moves efficiently and effectively through the building process in a manner that ensures students are able to learn in the new building as quickly as is feasible.
 So that's a huge task.
 as quickly as is feasible is still measured in years and not in months.
 But in the context of building this committee, once I was designated the chair, we got out the call for applications, we started to collect applications, and all of you are here.
 Meanwhile, there's a lot of work to do in the eligibility phase that we've already begun.
 So we'll talk about that in just a minute.
 But if you can go to the next slide.
 So this is a
 really junky graphic that did not blow up very well from the SBA website.
 But as we're talking about the entire process, right, we are just outside the box for another like six hours.
 On May 1st, we'll hop inside the box into that eligibility period.
 At each of these steps in the process,
 The MSBA will have to sign off that we have completed all of the requirements of that phase.
 There will have to be a board meeting where they vote to invite us to the next phase.
 So at any point in this process, the MSBA could say, you're not ready to move on.
 They could also say, we don't like what you're doing.
 And they could also say, forget about it.
 So our job here is that none of those things happen.
 Our job is that we are going to play this clean, we are going to be comprehensive, and we are going to move as fast as we humanly can.
 Okay, so we're going to give the MSBA a run for their money because we're going to be ready for them.
 Well, we'll see.
 But that eligibility period lasts for 270 days.
 So by January, we have to be done with the eligibility phase.
 I'm going to talk a little bit about what happens in that phase.
 Beyond the eligibility phase, just briefly, when we talk about forming the project team, that means bringing on board our owner's project manager.
 then we go into the feasibility study.
 When people think about what we're doing on this committee, they think we're doing a feasibility study right now.
 They think we're deciding, are we building?
 Are we renovating?
 Where are we building?
 Is it on the field?
 Is it in the parking lot?
 How's it going to work?
 We are not there yet.
 So please tell all your friends
 We will get there and we will work with professionals to help make those assessments on behalf of what we need to do in this building.
 And then we'll move on to schematic design, funding the projects.
 That is where we vote as a community to fund this project.
 I cannot stress how important that will be, but also we've got a lot of work to do before we get there.
 Once that happens, we go into detailed design, then we put a shovel in the ground, and then at some point in future, we complete the project.
 So that's sort of the soup to nuts.
 My goal is that we're just going to take this one step at a time.
 We're going to do what we need to do to be compliant with the eligibility period, and then we're going to move on.
 As we near that next phase, we're going to start talking about how can we accelerate the work.
 But for right now, our focus is eligibility.
 So if you can flip to the next page.
 The eligibility process is its own graphic, which you cannot see.
 So go ahead and flip to the next slide.
 Okay.
 So there are five things that have to happen in this phase.
 One is the initial compliance certification.
 It's a legal agreement that binds the city to comply with the MSBA's process.
 It has been signed and it has been delivered to the MSBA.
 We are one day ahead of schedule and I'm going to own that.
 Thank you, Mayor and Superintendent.
 We're on our way.
 Number two, the building committee has to be formed.
 You're all here.
 The school committee said meet before May 1st and here we are on April 30th.
 We've done it.
 The form will be submitted to the MSBA shortly.
 So we are working on that and that'll be submitted shortly.
 That's obviously the easy part.
 It's paperwork.
 I think
 The whole eligibility phase is a lot of paperwork, but this is the easy stuff.
 And we're just going to get it done and get it out of the way.
 The MSBA will need to sign off on our committee.
 We have met all the requirements.
 So the MSBA has all kinds of things that it requires of us in terms of who is on this committee.
 We've met all of those requirements with all of you here.
 Now we're going to dive into the actual work.
 There's three additional things that have to happen.
 One is what they call an educational profile.
 It's a template document, and it requires us to say, what happens in this building today?
 How many classrooms?
 How many math classrooms?
 How many swing spaces?
 How big is your theater?
 All of it, right?
 So it asks you to describe currently what happens in this building.
 It also asks you to describe what you envision for the future of this building.
 So this is where those conversations about Curtis Tufts, those conversations about early childhood become very, very important.
 Because between our statement of interest and this eligibility phase, educational profile, that will set the tone for how all the construction professionals actually can do their work.
 So this is going to set the scope, as it were, for the work that has to be done to actually get this building put up.
 So there's a lot of work that's been done right now in this process.
 I have been meeting with the administrative team since February.
 We meet multiple times a week.
 They're very sick of me.
 I would be sick of me.
 But one of the things that we have started to do is say, what can we chip away at?
 And so the document is pretty well drafted when it comes to
 What do we do in this building?
 All the classrooms have been counted.
 All the programs have been outlined.
 There's a little bit more work for the administration to do in terms of what happens today to accurately describe that.
 The other thing that is obviously much more complicated is having some conversation around what will we do in this building in the future?
 So in that conversation, again, we've been having a lot of sort of broad conversation.
 We've been sort of tapping into like the strategic planning parts of our brain to ask big questions, and I'm going to use Curtis Tufts just for a quick minute.
 We have had some discussion about do our educators think that is something that we should be thinking about and the answer to that is yes, they said, yes, we should be thinking about that.
 And so we started to say okay what does that look like what might.
 the requirements be.
 So we've started that conversation, but that conversation is bigger than what this committee can sort of chew on because it sort of dabbles in responsibilities of the school committee.
 So last night I served up a resolution asking our special education and behavioral health subcommittee, which is actually chaired by member Rousseau, to have a meeting on a very tight timeline to collect input and feedback
 about that very narrow topic.
 Would co-location of the Curtis-Tufts onto this campus in some capacity be beneficial to the educational outcomes of the students that go to Curtis-Tufts?
 There is another Medford resident who actually spoke last night.
 He is in charge of a very comparable program at Somerville.
 He talked about this transition just happening in Somerville and how it exploded his population.
 It has changed the game for the students who need that alternative setting in terms of access to things like sports teams, in our case, the vocational programs.
 So there's huge, huge opportunity, but
 We want to make sure that the community and the committee have some opportunity to sort of think about all that that might bring to the table and provide a recommendation back to this committee.
 So that has been turfed.
 Last night, officially, to the Special Education Subcommittee, they will meet.
 They will invite current staff, current students, former students,
 community members, etc, etc.
 And Jack Hevery from Somerville to come and talk and work through that and provide a recommendation.
 So they're on their way, that will come back by mid-June.
 So they have their work cut out for them, but that will help us inform
 the drafting of that piece of what we envisioned for this school.
 Because what we likely will need is not just a couple of classrooms somewhere in the building.
 Part of why the Curtis Tufts is successful is because the environment is considerably different than this very, very big campus with 1,200 students.
 So we will have to think carefully about how we craft that.
 But hopefully, the work that the subcommittee does will come back to us and can be sort of funneled in.
 Marta and Chad will come to a future school committee meeting in the coming weeks and Marta will be talking about some of her ideas for alternative programming and what all that might look like even in the short term.
 And so that is something that will have to be sort of folded in.
 Joan and Suzanne and I and Paul had a conversation yesterday about early education.
 Our elementary schools are busting at the seams.
 We'll have to grapple with that problem sometime.
 MEEP used to be housed here.
 And we are going to explore a case that says MEAP should come back here.
 And that may or may not be ultimately where we land, but that is something that we're exploring because now is the time.
 We also talked a lot about
 students who don't have any sort of pre-k education, and as they enter our public schools, just how challenging the entry for those students are.
 And so we are also talking about things like how big is the wait list, and how many students come to us who have never been in some sort of pre-k setting, and what kind of capacity would we need to service a bigger, more comprehensive early education program out of this building, because all of that would need to go into this document.
 So we are working on that.
 So as these things are happening, there's been a lot of work to date on this educational profile.
 The one big piece of educational profile we haven't touched yet is the communication strategy.
 I'll talk about that in just a minute.
 But on the education side, there's so much that our educators have to do for us to be able to get that document pulled together.
 I just want you all to know it's all in process and as we go through our next several meetings we'll bring those documents forward so we can start to do like broader reading of those documents, ask for suggestions, make sure that we are really thinking about all the angles of what we need to describe and so that is where I think all of you play a really important role to say
 I think you need to describe what we're doing here a little bit differently based on what I know or based on sort of what the vision is for the arts programs or for the vocational programs, et cetera, et cetera.
 So that's where we are on the educational profile.
 Curtis Tuft's co-location is in subcommittee.
 The other big sort of newer, newish, changing topic is MEEP.
 What MSBA describes as the reason for delay often in communities is that they're having to make very big decisions that feed their building process.
 Like, do we combine two schools?
 And so that obviously has its own energy and its own set of requirements, which makes it very challenging to be able to move quickly.
 So we are trying to both think very big because this is
 a one-shot opportunity to think about what the district really does need in a very comprehensive way, but also move as fast as possible.
 So all that work has been in progress and moving as quickly as is humanly possible.
 Peter, can you go to the next slide?
 Very similarly on the vocational side, because we have a very active vocational school, we have another document that needs to be filled out, which is a Chapter 74 viability.
 Chapter 74 is the chapter of the regulation that establishes vocational programs, right?
 OK.
 That drafting is in progress.
 We have to tell them, here are the programs we have.
 Here is the capacity of those programs.
 Here is our current enrollment.
 And things like, what is our wait list?
 We also have an opportunity to describe intended expansion of these programs.
 Chad and Peter will be at the school committee talking about potential for expansion.
 That is a school committee matter because expanded program takes much more than just a building.
 It takes equipment, it takes staffing.
 So the school committee has to weigh in on that.
 So that's gonna come before the school committee on May 20th, and that will feed sort of the finalization of
 the chapter 70 form and and this group will read through and sort of get ready for that as well.
 Um, and then there is a piece, um, of the puzzle, which, um, the mayor and the superintendent and I are talking to MSBA about later this week, which is really information around city planning.
 So we can start to, um, feed information into what they call their enrollment study that helps size the building.
 So you've probably heard a lot about this building was built for 4,000 students, and now there's only 1200 that.
 Whether 4,000 was the number or not, I don't know, but it is true that the number is different.
 And so one of the things that the MSBA will do in the eligibility phase is they will say, we're going to build a building for this many students.
 That usually tracks with something like what happens in the building today.
 However, if there's huge planned expansion in the city in terms of housing units going up for development, they're going to want to know all of that.
 So that they can size the building because they don't want us to build a building that is immediately out of capacity.
 They also don't want us to build a building that will never be at capacity, right so so that's some of the work that's happening there.
 Fourth thing, maintenance documents.
 There's a questionnaire that we have to answer that outlines all of our maintenance practices across the district.
 So it's things like, do you do recommissioning?
 And how is your staff trained?
 There's like 20 variables.
 That document is also in draft and moving along as quickly as is humanly possible.
 We'll get to that probably a little bit later in June.
 Final thing that we need to do to be considered done with eligibility is we have to identify funding for the feasibility study, which is probably somewhere in the neighborhood of two and a quarter to two and a half million dollars.
 We're not ready for that yet, but we're making plans.
 The mayor and I are working on what will that plan be from a financial task force perspective, so that that money can be accounted for and cared for as quickly as it is required to be.
 questions about the process.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5920.302s">[Preisner]</a>: Asire w.
 Kidonk, lè li di otorizasyon lokal, èske sa vle di elektora a pa vote?
 Non.
 Oswa èske li vle di
 Gen lajan.
 Gouvènman vil la te idantifye finansman.
 Kòrèk.
 An plen, yon pati nan yo pral ranbouse.
 Men, mwen panse ke otorizasyon an dwe pou tout kantite lajan an.
 Kòrèk.
 FDA a pral di w ki sa ranbousman an baze sou kote nou tonbe sou ranbousman an.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5944.979s">[Graham]</a>: Kòrèk.
 Se konsa, faisabilité, finansman sa a ap gen pou kouvri tout depans etid faisabilité a.
 Se pa tout pwojè a, jis etid la posibilite, ki se tankou $2 a $2.5 milyon dola.
 Vil la pral peye pou tout etid posibilite sa a davans.
 Lè sa a, yon fwa ke MSBA sètifye pousantaj ranbousman nou an pou pwojè a epi nou gen siksè tout wout la, yo pral ranbouse etid la posibilite ki koresponn ak pousantaj alokasyon ke yo bay nou.
 Se konsa, wi, wi.
 Yo pral sèvi ak menm fòmil sa a epi aplike nan etid la posibilite ak rabè tounen vil la.
 Men, vil la gen devan lajan sa a.
 Se konsa, sa ki dwe rive isit la se
 ke nou ta dwe fè sa.
 Si nou te bezwen ale nan yon elektora eli pou pwokire lajan sa a, nou ta dwe fè sa.
 Nou pa prevwar ki nou bezwen fer sa.
 Nou gen yon plan finansman pou sa, e nou ta dwe bon.
 Se konsa, nou te oke la, e sa pral mande pou yon vòt nan konsèy vil la otorize fon yo epi mete l 'nan yon plas kote nou ka jwenn aksè nan li.
 Men, nou nan bon fòm la.
 Kòm mwen mansyone, tout bagay sa yo dwe vlope nan mwa janvye.
 Chak gen yon dat limit patikilye ki asosye ak li.
 Mwen pral vrèman agresif epi di ou ke mwen vle tout bagay sa yo fini anvan kòmansman lekòl ane pwochèn.
 E nenpòt kote li posib, mwen vle bagay sa yo fèt anvan 30 jen.
 Um, se poutèt sa nou te rankontre ak travay ak pouse.
 Um, e mwen panse ke, um, li la, li enpòtan pou nou detire.
 Se konsa, ann, ann detire epi ann prepare.
 Um, MSBA a pral gen travay yo fè an tèm de, um, an tèm de jwenn, um, etid enskripsyon an sètifye ak tout sa, men mwen vle nou kapab ba yo tout sa yo bezwen pou nou ka deplase. pi vit posib nan pwochen faz sa a.
 Kesyon sou delè.
 Oke.
 Se konsa, nou gen jis 20 minit kite.
 Pou sa, nou mete sou do ajanda a yon kantite reyinyon soukomite k ap vini yo.
 Mwen ta renmen nou panse ak priyorite de bagay jan nou
 antre nan premye faz sa a.
 Youn nan se yon komite kominikasyon ak angajman kominotè.
 Mwen vle sòt de yon soukomite, ki ta dwe pa plis pase sèt manm vòt, men yon gwoup ki enterese rankontre nan soukomite reyèlman kapab dekri ak deskripsyon pwosesis angajman kominote nou an.
 Mwen panse ke nou tout te wè moun nan kominote a eksprime enkyetid yo pou, èske Medford pral vise sa a?
 Èske li pral travay?
 Èske li pral rive?
 Se konsa, gen yon gwo kontak kominote a ki gen pou rive.
 Ak pi bonè ke nou kòmanse sa, plis siksè nou pral nan fen a.
 Mwen panse ke sa a se yon konvèsasyon pi gwo, menm si, paske tou nan tèt mwen, nou genyen
 yon seri gwo tablo ak komisyon.
 Anpil nan yo enterese nan pwojè sa a.
 Se konsa, pral bezwen gen kèk sansibilizasyon yo konprann ki lè ak ki jan yo angaje yo pou nou ka gen sa sou plan prensipal nou an vanse.
 dezyèm gwoup mwen ta renmen fòme aswè a se Rules and Onboarding Committee.
 Se konsa, jan ou tande Janelle, nou dwe etabli kèk règ sou fason nou pral opere, patikilyèman nan patisipasyon piblik, men jis an jeneral.
 Mon ekspekte sa komite i annan letan limite.
 Mwen espere ou ka rankontre yon fwa, pote yon bouyon tounen nan gwoup sa a, epi Lè sa a, nou ka adopte règ sa yo ak sòt de jere apati de la.
 Apre sa, twazyèm komite a ki pa pral rankontre byen vit, men ki pral rankontre,
 anvan fen mwa Jen an se soukomite finans lan.
 Kidonk, sa pral yon komite permanent ki pral rankontre epi kontinye pandan tout lavi pwojè a.
 Li enpòtan sonje ke lè lè a rive kote kominote a gen pou vote,
 Komite sa a pa kote travay sa a rive.
 Se konsa, si nou ap pale de finalman bezwen yon esklizyon dèt yo nan lòd yo finanse pwojè sa a, komite sa a se pa kote, tankou, ann pase eksklizyon dèt la rive.
 Sa aktyèlman pa ka rive isit la.
 Li dwe rive andeyò gwoup sa a.
 Um, kidonk komite finans sa a, mwen wè sa kòm plis, um, bay opinyon, um, ak insight sou bagay tankou acha, akizisyon, um, nan manadjè pwojè pwopriyetè nou an, um, nan achitèk nou yo, kalite bagay sa yo, um, men tou pou ede enfòme, tankou, ajisteman an nan sa nou bezwen pou posibilite?
 Èske gen lòt depans nou bezwen kontablite pou?
 Se konsa, gen, gen kèk travay finans yo dwe fè, kwake, um,
 ou konnen, mwen pa prevwa ke gwoup sa a pral rankontre jiskaske yon ti kras pita nan mwa me.
 Se konsa, nou pral pale yon ti kras plis sou tankou règ Robert's of Order ak tout bagay sa yo nan pwochen reyinyon nou an.
 Mwen konnen se, tout moun tankou gade m tankou, sispann pale, tanpri.
 Li nan 8.
 Se konsa, mwen panse ke sa mwen enterese nan se tankou, si gen moun ki tande nenpòt nan sijè sa yo epi ki di, mwen reyèlman vle fè pati
 youn nan soukomite sa yo, èske ou ka jis idantifye tèt ou?
 Apre sa, mwen ta tou politès sijere ke administratè lekòl yo petèt kenbe men ou desann paske ou gen pwòp travay ou fè pou pare pou tout rès sa nou sot dekri a.
 Se konsa, ou se 100% akeyi.
 pou patisipe, men nou bezwen w ap prezante nan komite lekòl la.
 Nou bezwen John ak Peter pou ede ak plan antretyen sa yo, elatriye.
 Donk, si gen moun ki enterese nan nenpòt nan lòt sijè sa yo, komite a pa ka twò gwo, men li kapab nenpòt gwosè ke nou konsidere nesesè pou fè travay la.
 Se konsa, sou-komite sa yo, mwen mete yo sou kalandriye a.
 Nou pral rankontre pa Zoom nèt sou aswè sa yo jis pou fè bagay yo yon ti kras pi fasil.
 Men, ou konnen, chak pral gen yon liv trè espesifik nan pwochen reyinyon nou an sou 13 me, ki se pote tounen yon bouyon nan sòt de sa ki pwopozisyon yo se.
 Èske gen volontè?
 Wi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6321.323s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Pou de lòt yo.
 presize konbyen?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6325.707s">[Graham]</a>: Mwen panse ke li kapab nenpòt kantite moun.
 Li pa kapab plis pase sèt manm vòt yo.
 Men, mwen panse si nou literalman jis retire tout anplwaye lekòl la sou tab la, mwen pa twò konsène ke nou pral trip sou sa.
 Men, mwen plis enterese nan moun ki fè bagay sa yo ke yo santi yo se yon bon anfòm pou travay yo ap fè a, pou travay yo ke yo pasyone.
 Mèsi.
 Maria.
 Kominikasyon.
 Mèsi.
 Tracy.
 Règ.
 OK.
 Kominikasyon.
 Marissa.
 Awesome.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6367.334s">[Libby Brown]</a>: Mwen vle di, mwen te kapab mete sou de ak wè si ta gen ase swa nan kominikasyon yo oswa finans.
 OK.
 OK.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6374.859s">[Graham]</a>: Mwen pral mete ou nan finans.
 Kòman son sa ye?
 Son bon.
 OK.
 Èske mwen tande yon bagay?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6381.976s">[Galusi]</a>: Oke.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6385.438s">[Graham]</a>: Ak Fiona, finans.
 Epi nou ka enskri Bob pou finans tou?
 Gwo.
 Wi, wi, absoliman.
 Nenpòt lòt moun k ap pran pou komite sa yo?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6402.244s">[Preisner]</a>: Si ou pa jwenn ase finans.
 Oke, mwen pral mete ou sou lis la.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6412.739s">[Graham]</a>: Gen de moun pou règ ak onboarding.
 Sa kòrèk.
 Mwen te planifye pou m chita sou tout komite yo, men petèt nou ka mande Emily Lazzaro pou l patisipe nan soukomite règ ak onboarding la.
 Um, e konsa mwen pral tcheke avèk li, men, um, e mwen te mete Nicole Morell sou sou-komite kominikasyon an tou.
 Se konsa, um, nou pral tcheke avèk yo, men èske gen nenpòt lòt moun ki santi yo fòtman, oswa ou ta renmen ale?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6447.185s">[Olapade]</a>: Oke, gwo.
 Oke, mwen te pral di finans, men mwen definitivman pa gen anpil eksperyans nan sa.
 OK.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6455.601s">[Graham]</a>: Mwen panse ke nou bon.
 Jan?
 Non, ou gen travay pou fè.
 Oh, absoliman.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6461.327s">[Parkinson]</a>: E mwen panse ke pou tout teknisyen aktyèl yo nan gwoup la,</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6470.157s">[Graham]</a>: Pral gen yon gwoup k ap travay anvan nou rive twò lwen nan sa a ki gen pou mete ansanm yon RFP pou manadjè pwojè yon pwopriyetè a.
 Sa se pa ekspètiz ke mwen kenbe.
 Se pa pou sa mwen la.
 Se konsa, nou pral konte sou tout moun pou diferan sou-komite sou tan.
 Sa a se jis nan wè tou pre mwen ki sa mwen te panse nou ta dwe kòmanse ak.
 Èske sa fè sans?
 Èske nenpòt moun gen nenpòt lòt sijesyon sou bagay ki dwe rive iminanman?
 Mwen gen yon kesyon.
 Asire w.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6499.089s">[Larry Brown]</a>: Ou mansyone tankou Curtis potansyèlman vini isit la ak tout itilizasyon sa yo divès kalite pou etablisman an.
 Ki moun ki ap eksplore opsyon sa yo, i.e.
 tankou ed kominotè, tankou travay petèt ak yon kolèj kominotè, kou aswè tankou mwen te laba a espere sou ak Asosyasyon Kontraktè Jeneral AGC ak yo ap fè edikasyon granmoun.
 Èske yon moun tankou,
 mete yon pakèt opsyon sou tab la ke ou mesye renmen konsidere oswa ki jan sa ye?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6534.345s">[Graham]</a>: Wi, kalite pa, men pa byen.
 Nou poko la.
 Se konsa, mwen panse ke yon fwa nou jwenn nan ront inisyal sa a nan moso nan chapit 74, tankou li ta ka fè sans pou nou sòt de ajoute ke nan.
 Se konsa, lè nou kòmanse li nan dokiman sa yo, mwen panse ke sa a se yon bon moman pou di tankou, ki lòt moun nou bezwen kontakte?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6554.235s">[Larry Brown]</a>: Paske tout kalite bagay sa yo pral enpak
 aksesiblite, pwoksimite, gwosè enstalasyon kont lòt, depo, pakin, ou konnen.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6563.741s">[Graham]</a>: Oke, wi, mwen panse ke se yon gwo lide.
 Mwen pral mete l sou lis la.
 Wi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6568.884s">[Ruseau]</a>: Nou an reyalite limite pa vil nou an.
 Nou ye.
 Si tout moun nan sal la te tankou, Federal Rec ta dwe la.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6577.15s">[Parkinson]</a>: Li pa nan vil la.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6585.563s">[Graham]</a>: Men, lekòl kominotè yo se.
 Se konsa, wi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6595.083s">[Preisner]</a>: Oke.
 Wi, se konsa mwen te vle mande, ou konnen, ki moun ki pral resous komite sa a ak nenpòt fòm enfrastrikti dijital?
 Se konsa, mwen pral referans SOI la.
 Gen SOI la.
 Te gen sondaj ki te bay SOI sa a.
 Gen pwobableman yon lis antye nan lòt dokiman piblik ki pa aktyèlman piblikman aksesib, men sa ta dwe.
 Ou konnen, sou-komite angajman kominote kominikasyon sa a pral gen chay la
 kominike menm bagay la pwobableman pou anpil moun.
 Yeah, sa a pi efikasman fè atravè yon sit entènèt, atravè petèt yon depo pataje, epi sètènman ta ka gen yon fas deyò.
 Ou konnen, pòtal dwat tankou yon sit entènèt tankou chak lekòl ki te gen youn nan pwojè sa yo pou ak Lè sa a, kalite yon depo final kote Sheldon a ka gade nan poukisa, pou egzanp, li ta ka disponib nenpòt lè pou manm oswa, ou konnen. , sòt de sou lis aksè a.
 Asire w.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6657.678s">[Graham]</a>: Mwen ka ba ou yon aktyalizasyon.
 Nou te resevwa sa a.
 Se konsa, nou aktyèlman pwokire yon URL ki inik nan komite sa a, epi li nan buildingMHS.org.
 Eske se vre?
 Oke.
 Se konsa, URL la egziste.
 Paj la egziste.
 Thomas aktyèlman ap travay sou kalite zo resous kominote sa a.
 Rezon ki fè nou te mande nou tout bios ak foto se tout sa yo pral ale sou sit entènèt la, kidonk li ap travay nan tout sa nan wòl li kòm Direktè Kominikasyon an.
 Tom te dakò, menmsi li se Direktè Kominikasyon sòtan an, pou l rete espesyalman pou pwojè sa a jiskaske nou anboche ranplasman li.
 Kidonk, Thomas ak kèk nan etidyan pwofesyonèl nou yo ap konstwi sit entènèt sa a, mwen sipoze anba Lisa Miller.
 Apre sa, pral gen yon eleman dokiman nan sa a kote tout dokiman sa yo aksesib piblikman yo pral pou ke lè yon moun di, ki kote sa a?
 Nou ka montre yo nan yon sèl kote.
 Tout minit reyinyon nou yo ap ale la.
 Tout ajanda reyinyon nou yo pral ale la.
 Se konsa, nou te gen yon estrikti antye an plas deja pou eseye fè sa.
 Nou pa byen pare, men mwen espere nan pwochen reyinyon an, nou pral kapab bay fowòm nou an yon vizit.
 sit entènèt sa a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6731.704s">[Preisner]</a>: Oke.
 Um, e konsa jis swiv se sa pral pòtal la deyò fè fas a.
 Kouman sou backend la pou nou?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6738.866s">[Graham]</a>: Se konsa, sa a se yon kesyon difisil paske dapre lalwa a reyinyon ouvè, reyèlman pa gen yon back end pou nou.
 Le pli vit ke yon ajanda afiche, tout dokiman li yo fè pati dosye piblik la.
 Men, si nou se, sa ki difisil se si nou ap travay sou bagay sa yo dèyè sèn nan, nou gen anpil chans vyole lwa a reyinyon ouvè.
 Donk, administratè yo gen kopi travay dokiman y ap travay sou yo epi yo pa reprezante yon kowòm epi yo ka kontinye fè sa.
 Yon fwa dokiman sa yo vini isit la, yo pral mete yo nan yon kondwi ki disponib piblikman.
 Ak lè nou pale sou koreksyon yon dokiman, pa gen okenn koreksyon offline nan komite sa a.
 Li pa pèmèt dapre lwa reyinyon ouvè a.
 Se konsa, malerezman, nou pral fè mal chita isit la epi ansanm edite yon dokiman.
 Li se vrèman youn nan pati ki pi douloure nan jere pwosesis sa a ke ou tout te siyen pou.
 Mwen regrèt.
 Men, wi, li se ekstrèmman douloure, men offline, ki kalite koreksyon offline ki travay super efektivman nan literalman tout lòt kote nan mond lan se pa yon opsyon isit la.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6811.109s">[Preisner]</a>: Oke, kidonk pa gen Google Drive, pa gen okenn dokiman pataje, bagay yo pral lage.
 Lè yo lage, yo parèt sou sit entènèt la.
 Lè yo parèt sou sitwèb la, yo se esansyèlman kontwòl konfigirasyon epi yo pa ka chanje sof si chanjman sa yo fèt isit la nan vèsè.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6826.757s">[Graham]</a>: Kòrèk.
 Wi.
 Li se absoliman terib.
 Nou te jwenn fason yo fè li mwens terib, men li nan degre nan mwens terib, Malerezman.
 Epi sa se yon fason asire w jwenn tèt ou nan dlo cho ak kominote a an tèm de fason dokiman jwenn edited.
 Se konsa, pral, epi lè nou fè sa yo, mwen jwenn ke reyinyon sa yo pi efikas sou Zoom.
 Ou ka chita kote ou bezwen chita epi tout moun ka gade yon dokiman dwe modifye epi pa ka gen okenn sòt de lide ke dokiman an ap modifye san yo pa rive nan ouvè.
 Se konsa, nou dwe pile trè alalejè sou sa.
 Men wi, se yon pwosesis.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6903.643s">[Parkinson]</a>: totalman move politik, 40 manm.
 Epi yon manm te tankou, Simon, jis asire w ke ou nan do a epi renmen, ekri kòmantè nou yo la epi mete yo ansanm.
 Epi repons lan se non.
 Se konsa, ou tape kòmantè ou yo, reponn yo gen ou, yo te tankou, oke, rekonèt.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6926.232s">[Galusi]</a>: Wi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6926.472s">[Parkinson]</a>: Se jis, nou regrèt.
 Sa a se tankou, nou dakò sa a se pwobableman pi gwo a</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6933.462s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Wi.
 Mèsi ankò paske ou isit la.
 Mwen trè enterese nan pyès kominikasyon an tou, byenke li te bèl nan travay, men mwen kontan toujou pran kèk apèl.
 Epi yo pral tounen isit la.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6948.428s">[Graham]</a>: Tout mizajou sa yo ap tounen isit la.
 Nenpòt lòt kesyon mwen ka reponn sou sou-komite oswa nenpòt lòt bagay ki te sou ajanda a?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6958.671s">[King]</a>: Mwen gen yon kesyon.
 Mwen gen yon kesyon sou vote.
 Wi, lè nou rive vote.
 Wi, nou pa.
 Ki sa ki nan yon sèl bagay ke mwen pa janm gen tèt mwen alantou se proxy pèmèt.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6972.628s">[Graham]</a>: Non.
 Non, se pa sa.
 Èske prokurasyon pèmèt nan yon reyinyon?
 Non, ou pa kapab bay vòt ou a yon lòt moun.
 Letan nou adjourn sa meeting, nou pou pratik voting akoz nou pou vot pou adjourn meeting.
 Anjeneral, sa ta rive atravè sa yo rele yon vòt vwa kote tout moun jis di wi epi nou ale.
 Nou jis pral pratike yon apèl paske se
 Yon fwa ankò, etranj ak gòch.
 So nou ava fer sa pour adjourn meeting.
 Men, nenpòt lòt kesyon anvan nou adjourn reyinyon an?
 Li te fè atansyon.
 Men, mwen panse ke lòt bagay ki merite dekri se ke gen yon bon kantite manm ki pa gen dwa vote nan komite sa a.
 Rezon ki fè yo se pa paske nou pa vle tande pale de ou.
 Ou la paske nou vle tande pale de ou.
 Lè vòt la fèt, nou p ap rele non w epi ou p ap vote.
 Men, lòt kote, ou se yon manm konplè nan komite sa a.
 Mwen te avèti sa
 lè ou gen twòp manm vòt, li vin trè difisil pou fè biznis paske ou dwe gen yon kowòm nan komite a pou menm rankontre ak fè biznis.
 Sa tout vin trè, trè konplike.
 Se konsa, sa a te sòt de tantativ nou yo di, nou vle gen yon gwo komite wonn, men nou bezwen tou kapab renmen deplase efikasman ak efektivman ak tout bagay sa yo.
 Se konsa, sa a se sòt de rezon ki fè yo dèyè.
 sa nou te fè la.
 Epi, ou konnen, mwen panse ke, ou konnen, gwosè a nan komite a pral chanje pandan lavi li, pou asire w.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7068.989s">[King]</a>: Se konsa, nan 25 yo?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7070.309s">[Graham]</a>: Wi, genyen 15 manm pou vote nan komite a, ki tou se toujou yon bon kantite manm vote.
 Epi nou pral pratike vote nan jis yon segonn.
 Men, èske gen nenpòt lòt kesyon pwochen reyinyon an?
 Règ yo, règ yo ak abònman 7 me, angajman kominote a 8 me, epi yo pral pote rezilta yo tounen nan gwoup sa a 13 me.
 Se konsa, genus la, vas majorite nan reyinyon 13 me nou an ap travay atravè rekòmandasyon sa yo, dakò sou plan sa yo.
 Ankò, se konsa nou ap sòt de nan mòd kòmanse.
 Apre sa, apre sa, nou pral antre nan vyann nan kèk nan dokiman sa yo ke administrasyon an te travay sou epi kòmanse.
 fè yon lekti nan dokiman sa yo pale sou sa ki la ak kalite bagay sa yo.
 Men, nou pral avanse vit.
 Nou te mete deyò orè reyinyon an jis kòm yon ti kras nan rezon ki fè la.
 Nou pral rankontre pi byen nou kapab an pèsòn isit la nan Bishop 489 pou
 ant kounye a ak fen mwa Jen an.
 Mwen pwomèt ou ke nou pral retounen nan lendi swa nan kòmansman ane lekòl pwochèn.
 Men, sa a ant kounye a ak fen mwa Jen an, ant reyinyon komite lekòl la ak jou ferye, li te tankou konplètman enposib aktyèlman kenbe kalite orè sa a.
 Nou pral rankontre sèlman atravè Zoom an ete a, epi nou aktyèlman deplase reyinyon yo nan Mèkredi an konsiderasyon ke lendi ak vandredi yo vrèman difisil nan ete a pou jwenn yon fowòm nan nenpòt moun ki fè anyen.
 Se konsa, èspere ke nou ka fè travay sa a, men mwen te eseye kenbe orè reyinyon an limyè.
 Mwen panse ke pral gen plis sou-komite ant kounye a ak fen mwa Out, men sa a te jis yon sòt de yon kòmansman pou moun ka eseye òganize lavi okipe yo.
 Wi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7178.606s">[Parkinson]</a>: Men, sa se yon kesyon prokurasyon.
 Si ou pa ka fè li.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7183.63s">[Bowen]</a>: Se oke.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7184.27s">[Parkinson]</a>: Voye ou voye tou yon imèl ak tout panse ou ak kòmantè.
 Prezidan, vwa ou disparèt.
 Se konsa, um,</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7205.75s">[Preisner]</a>: An reyalite, sa a se yon kesyon teknik.
 Se konsa, yon mesye pa ka fè reyinyon an voye ba ou yon imèl ki endike panse li ak rekòmandasyon, petèt menm yon desizyon.
 Byen bonè nou tande imèl yo se yon move lide pou prèske tout bagay eksepte anviwònman ajanda.
 Se konsa, sa a son tankou yon zòn gri.
 Mwen t ap mande tèt mwen, kidonk ou te konnen lwa reyinyon ouvè a ak de bagay sa yo an konfli.
 Ki jan li travay?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7232.16s">[Graham]</a>: Se konsa, mwen ka sòt de di ou ke mwen panse ke nenpòt avoka ta di ou pa mete anyen nan ekri tout tan, dwa?
 Se konsa, se la nou kòmanse.
 Pa janm mete anyen alekri.
 Fin di sa, si ou pral mete yon bagay alekri, nan jan de scénario, wi, se yon zòn gri.
 Sa ou ta dwe fè se pran kontak ak yon moun epi di, hey, èske mwen ka voye ou panse mwen?
 Epi èske ou te diskite bagay sa yo ak nenpòt lòt moun oswa ou gen entansyon fè sa?
 Se konsa, si ou ka santi rezonab si ke ou te gen yon sikwi fèmen, dwa?
 Sa w ap di m, èske m ka voye panse m pou ou?
 Apre sa, mwen di, wi.
 Apre sa, mwen di, mwen pa pral pale ak okenn lòt moun sou zafè sa yo, Lè sa a, nou bon.
 Selman i vin en problenm ler ou ganny konekte avek en kantite dimoun ki reprezant en mazorite vot lo komite.
 Si, pa egzanp, ou te di, mwen vle di de moun paske mwen pa sèten ki moun ki pral aktyèlman fè reyinyon an, sa a toujou OK paske ou nan sid uit.
 Lè ou te pale ak tèt ou enkli, ak uit moun, kounye a ou nan pwoblèm.
 Se lè sa a ou te vyole lwa reyinyon ouvè a.
 Pati a difisil se tout moun ki enplike yo dwe gen menm konpreyansyon sou ki moun ki te patisipe nan konvèsasyon sa a.
 Kisa mwen te manke?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7312.233s">[Parkinson]</a>: Ou ka trè entansyonèl.
 Mwen sèlman di ou, epi ou se tankou, uh-huh.
 Apre sa, ou ale epi fè menm bagay la.
 Nou tout ap vyole lalwa, kèlkeswa sa nou te fè pou nou eseye defann li.
 Se konsa, mwen panse ke sa a trè enteresan yo trase yon liy.
 Se ke deliberasyon seri pa okipe anyen.
 Li pa kontni, plan, oswa asirans.
 Se jis nou de, pa vre?
 Wi.
 Ou ale epi vyole sa.
 Mwen vyole lalwa.
 Menm si mwen pa konnen.
 Dwa, dwat.
 Oke, wi, sa trè bon.
 Eske nou te deside?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7350.203s">[Graham]</a>: Nou pral jwenn tout moun yon adrès imel anba Medford Public Schools.
 Epi mwen ta ankouraje w pa sèvi ak imel pèsonèl ou nan okenn sikonstans pou nenpòt biznis ki gen rapò ak MSBA.
 Se konsa, le pli vit ke imèl sa yo mete kanpe, nou pral konvèti tout bagay sou.
 Men, mwen ta konseye anpil ke ou pa sèvi ak imel pèsonèl ou pou anyen.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7369.017s">[Parkinson]</a>: Li fè dosye piblik konfòmite fason pi pè.
 Mwen te ofisye aksè nan dosye pou distri lekòl la.
 Nenpòt dokiman ki fèt nan lekòl biznis ofisyèl la ki pa nòt pèsonèl ou yo se dosye piblik otomatikman bezwen yo dwe bay oswa omwen revize si yon moun mande pou yo.
 Se konsa, fè li tout nan adrès imel Medford Public Schools ou, nan suite Google Medford Public Schools ou a, kote ou pran nòt ak bagay konsa, vrèman itil pou jis genyen tout bagay nan espas sa a.
 Nenpòt dènye kesyon?
 Li nan 8.03.
 Nou jis pral renmen règ Robert yo ranvwaye reyinyon sa a.
 Èske gen yon mosyon pou adjourn?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7429.79s">[Graham]</a>: Mosyon pou adjourn par Manm Olapade, seconded par Manm Rousseau.
