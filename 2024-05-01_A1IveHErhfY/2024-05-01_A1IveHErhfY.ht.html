 Se konsa, nou sote entwodiksyon an pou kounye a.
 Se konsa, Janelle ka kenbe yon reyinyon louvri pandan fòmasyon paske li gen yon rezèvasyon pou dezyèm mwatye nan reyinyon sa a.
 Se konsa, mwen te vle asire w ke li te gen ase tan fè li.
 Men, anvan sa, mwen pral fè yon apèl rapid jis pou dosye a, nou konnen ki moun ki la isit la.

 Men, mwen pral vire ki sou Janelle pita.
 Men, mwen devine premye bagay la mwen pral di se ke tout nan reyinyon nou yo sijè a Lwa sou Reyinyon Open.

 Se konsa, mwen jis pral di sa a se eksperyans pèsonèl mwen.
 Li egziste pou yon rezon.
 Sa a se absoliman nesesè, men li mande pou nou tout panse ak anpil atansyon sou pa sèlman sa ou di ak fè nan reyinyon yo, men pi enpòtan, ki jan ou konpòte yo deyò nan reyinyon yo, paske
 Ou ka vyole lwa reyinyon louvri san yo pa reyalize li.
 MSB mande pou nou kenbe tout reyinyon an konfòmite ak Lwa sou Reyinyon Open, kidonk nou santi li enpòtan ke tout moun gen kèk eksperyans nan zòn sa a.
 Ofisyèl yo eli nan sal la te klèman abitye avèk lwa reyinyon louvri epi yo ka bay konsèy nenpòt ki moun ki te gen kesyon.
 Mwen jis siyen yo pou sa.
 Oke, mwen ta di edikatè yo nan sal la, ki moun ki tipikman kominike avèk komite lekòl la tout tan tout tan an, tipikman yo pa sijè a louvri lwa reyinyon yo, men nan sal sa a, sou pwoblèm sa a, yo ye.
 Se konsa, li nan yon melodi
 Ou pran sou yon seri de responsablite fason sa a.
 Se konsa, mwen pral lage l 'sou Janelle.
 Janelle, si ou ta renmen poze kesyon pandan pwosesis sa a oswa ou ta renmen nou kenbe yo jiskaske ou fini, tanpri fè nou konnen.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=405.964s">[Austin]</a>:  Sure.
 Thank you so much.
 Can everyone hear me okay?
 Yes.
 Thank you so much for having me this evening.
 Happy to present on this very important topic of the open meeting law.
 I will dive into the public records law a little bit to the extent there's a little bit of overlap.
 I always think it's a good idea to cover these topics.
 Certainly I agree in terms of open meeting law compliance.
 I represent the city of Medford, other communities across the state, and we are seeing a significant uptick in open meeting law compliance.
 So certainly a good opportunity to provide best practices, talk a little bit in terms of
 you know, what your role is in terms of open meeting law compliance, and I understand that some members may be more familiar than others, so I'll try to start with best practices, and I think that's always a good idea.
 If there are certainly any questions after the training,
 or along the way, I think we can feel free to interject.
 I'm an informal person, as many of you know, happy to have this be a conversation.
 If someone feels more comfortable speaking to me after the training, I'm certainly happy to make myself available as well.
 And the mayor has my contact information, happy to provide that.
 I would also start by saying certification is really important.
 So for any member that hasn't already completed their open meeting law certification, I recommend that be done as soon as possible.
 The new Attorney General has put forth a new updated open meeting law guide.
 last year.
 That's available on the Division of Open Government's website.
 I'm happy to circulate the link after this, but in my opinion, if any members are due for their open meeting law certification or for any new members, it's a good idea and certainly required under the open meeting law that that be conducted.
 We are going to cover best practices tonight where this is a public meeting.
 I don't want to go into any specifics or anything that may invoke the open meeting law in a non-confidential way.
 Certainly if there are any questions, happy to follow up afterwards.
 I think I have the ability to share my screen.
 So I wanted to go through the slides that I have.
 And again, if anyone has any particular questions, happy to either interject.
 I won't take offense or go from there.
 Can everyone see the slides okay?
 Great.
 So we're here tonight to talk about the open meeting law.
 I'm gonna talk about best practices.
 I'm gonna go through the sort of fundamentals of the open meeting law.
 We certainly start with the premise that the open meeting law, public records and conflict of interest law throughout the country are really, you know, aimed at government transparency and to eliminate secrecy in terms of the work.
 that you all are doing.
 So we know that under the open meeting law, public bodies such as yourself that are subject to the open meeting law can generally only conduct public business through their public meetings, unless there's a specific exemption applies called an executive session, which would allow you to have a confidential meeting.
 And we'll cover that a little bit further in the training.
 But in essence, the open meeting law regulates the process by which public meetings can be held and conducted.
 And there are really several components to what the open meeting law requires.
 So one, what types of meetings are subject to the law?
 What rules need to be followed to hold a meeting sufficient to give members of the public notice?
 And what are the common violations and why?
 And I think this is always a good idea to cover, again, not to scare anyone or detract from any of the important work that you all are doing, but really just so we're all aware of what the Attorney General's Division of Open Government requires in terms of enforcement, and really to make sure everyone's on the same page with respect to the work and business of the committee.
 The open meeting law addresses four major issues, so I want to cover those in detail.
 And apologies if this is, you know, some information that many of the members may have, but I think it's always a good idea to do a refresher.
 We know that the open meeting law requires notice.
 Essentially, it requires that postings be conducted no more than 48 weekday hours prior to the meeting.
 We know that the
 notice has to be posted in a location accessible 24 hours a day, including the website, and the meeting has to be held in an accessible location under the ADA.
 If you are meeting virtually or in a hybrid format, we can talk about that.
 Certainly, information should be available so members of the public know how to log in at home, and any location that you're meeting in person should be accessible as well.
 We also know that the meeting notice or the agenda should have detailed subject matter items, so we'll talk a little bit about what that means.
 But it's a detailed list of topics that you will all review so that a member of the public can look at that meeting notice at home and say, yes, I'd like to attend the meeting because I know these topics are going to be covered, or no, I'm going to pass on this one and go to the next one.
 someone should be able to say, I understand what this meeting is about and I want to attend this meeting based on what's on the meeting notice.
 We're going to talk a little bit about the nature of the meeting.
 As I mentioned at the beginning, there's a presumption under the open meeting law because of government transparency issues for an open session.
 So the meetings conducted as we're meeting tonight in an open session so members of the public can see in real time
 what the public body is doing, the votes that are being conducted and the deliberation, and we'll talk about what that means, of the body's business and the public business being conducted.
 There are certain pretty narrowly tailored reasons for a closed or an executive session, and we'll talk about the procedures if you do end up meeting in executive session.
 Conduct of the meeting, this is a hot,
 hot topic in recent years, essentially, you know, what rules govern public comment?
 What are the free speech principles that may apply?
 Who gets to speak and when in remote and hybrid meetings?
 So we'll cover that.
 And then the fourth major component of the open meeting law is the meeting minutes themselves.
 Essentially the content of the meeting, detailed enough, similar to a meeting notice to allow someone that wasn't present
 to know what transpired or what took place at the meeting.
 The timing for drafting and approving those meeting minutes, essentially for an open meeting within three meetings or 30 days, whichever is later, is a standard that the Attorney General's Division of Open Government established.
 And we'll talk about the process to do that.
 Most of the public bodies that I work with
 usually have them approved at a, you know, an open meeting of the public body for any meeting minutes, but some decide to designate that task to the chair or to another individual.
 That's a policy decision, but we can talk about that if anyone has any questions on that as well.
 So we'll go through the overview essentially.
 48 hours, I can't tell you how important that is prior to the date of the meeting.
 So certainly to be cognizant of
 legal holidays, vacation schedules, certainly as the summer months come up and there's various holidays in play, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, as well as July 4th, something to be aware of as you schedule meetings that it's 48 weekday hours, not including holidays or weekends.
 The meeting notice should list all the topics with specificity.
 And regardless of whether the meeting was posted correctly,
 We know that the open meeting law says that a meeting occurs whenever a quorum of your public body discusses matters within its jurisdiction.
 So we're gonna spend a lot of time on email practices and text message practices, because I certainly agree with the statement at the beginning of the meeting, that in essence, it's just as important what occurs outside of a public body's meeting under the open meeting law as to what occurs during a meeting.
 So we're gonna talk about pitfalls and some things to be careful of relative to your work.
 And essentially something that I see all the time and to be careful about is that we know that a quorum can be reached regardless of whether an email goes to the entire public body or whether it goes to several members and then it's forwarded to other members.
 So we're gonna talk about that.
 We call that serial communications and it's something with the,
 you know, explosion and all of us use technology all the time.
 It's something to be aware of, certainly, as you serve relative to the open meeting law to not get into a situation where there's deliberation over email or text message or other social media mechanisms.
 Subcommittees, I don't know if you intend to create any subcommittees, but certainly wanting to review that as well as we provide an overview.
 A subcommittee is also subject to the open meeting law.
 The intent to create a subcommittee essentially is not required, and the attorney general will look to determine whether or not the subcommittee is within government, empowered to act collectively in serving a public purpose.
 So generally speaking, unless there's an exception, and we'll talk about that, a subcommittee of your committee is essentially subject to the open meeting law.
 just as the entire compliment would be.
 You know, there are exceptions to that.
 If the mayor created a subcommittee to advise just herself or the superintendent did, where they are not individually subject to the open meeting law, a subcommittee created by them wouldn't be.
 It's a very fact specific analysis.
 So we just wanna be really careful with respect to the creation of subcommittees or working groups or task forces.
 to determine whether or not they are subject to the open meeting law.
 Some practical ways, I try to be practical as many of you know, to avoid violations of the open meeting law.
 One person reporting back to the public body doesn't create a subcommittee.
 And if multiple members are using, doing work on behalf of the public body, you would wanna post a meeting and comply with the open meeting law.
 Any questions so far?
 Okay, I'll continue on.
 Some tips to stay out of trouble.
 And this is all things that I've seen in advising municipalities since 2006 on open meeting law and public records issues.
 So it certainly comes from experience.
 If you are attending a meeting of another public body, school committees, city council,
 the city of Medford.
 Um another.
 I'm sure you're all very involved in the city of Medford and the work that the city does.
 You want to avoid creating the appearance, whether that be at another public bodies meeting or social event or community event.
 Um that you are discussing matters within this public bodies jurisdiction.
 Um I've handled open meeting law complaints or issues over the years where there's an
 or there was a community event and I think that they were talking about X, Y and Z. So certainly you wanna avoid the appearance that you are discussing municipal business.
 To the extent you need to meet jointly with the city council or the school committee or another public body, you can post a joint meeting to be held at the same time and place and then minutes would be prepared just as they would for any other meeting that you may have.
 If you're doing a site visit, certainly,
 best practice may be to send a representative to report back, and then that content is included in the next session's meeting minutes.
 You don't want to be in a position where there's a site visit at a particular location, for instance, that is not accessible.
 And then we're going to spend a lot of time tonight on email, but I can't reiterate this enough to try to avoid the use of email or text messages or social media.
 amongst a quorum of your public body.
 Locations, you're gonna wanna file your meeting notice with the city clerk and they're online as well.
 Some best practices with respect to using your or posting your meeting notice.
 I would recommend not using acronyms or abbreviations.
 Really someone that just moved to the city of Medford should be able to pick it up and say,
 I understand what's going on at this meeting.
 We all that do work with public bodies and public entities understand terms like MSBCA or MSBA, DEP, you know, DEF DESI, but certainly, you know, for the first time, you may want to spell it out just so everyone knows what is being discussed.
 The meeting notice should indicate the date and time of the posting.
 And if you do revise it, I don't know what the practice is going to be.
 You're going to want to include both the date that it was originally drafted and then the revised date as well.
 And that should be done 48 hours, 48 business hours in advance.
 Regularly occurring items do need some more detail than just these examples that I've used.
 What we know from recent determinations from the Division of Open Government is that more detail is better than less detail, so we don't really want to use categories such as new business, old business, or departmental report.
 We really want to specify, for instance, correspondence and list if there's any notable correspondence or
 you know, budget analysis and list any particular reports, for instance, that are going to be done.
 So I would recommend erring on the side of more, not less specificity, which should be helpful to alert members of the public about the exact topics that are going to be discussed.
 Any questions on any of this?
 Great.
 Some practical considerations, and this does come up obviously from time to time, scheduling matters or space limitations.
 Generally, a meeting may not be continued from one night to the next as a matter of course, unless that continuation is posted under the open meeting law.
 So if you couldn't meet tonight, would have to reschedule this meeting and repost it for the new date and time.
 And the notice requirement under the open meeting law doesn't substitute or supersede any other notice requirements if you have them under any other legal requirements.
 So always worth double checking to make sure you're covering any publication notice or anything else that may be required.
 Emergencies.
 I can't tell you how many questions I get regarding emergencies, particularly in the winter months with inclement weather.
 There are very limited instances when a public body can meet without that 48 hours notice that's required.
 Poor planning doesn't equal an emergency.
 We know from determinations of the Attorney General's office.
 So if there was just a mishap with respect to scheduling, and I certainly understand everyone's doing the best they can, and you certainly have a lot of schedules to figure out,
 with respect to the public body's business, but generally an emergency is limited to natural disasters, public health matters, and public safety issues.
 So something to be aware of.
 We can talk a little bit about if something's unanticipated, that's a little bit different, but hosting is really limited in the emergency context.
 If you do have an emergency you really need to meet,
 There's a specific reason why the 48 hours couldn't have been, it couldn't have been posted with the 48 hours.
 You do want to comply with the open meeting law to the extent you can, and really limit deliberations to just that emergency matter.
 You're gonna take meeting minutes of that emergency meeting, and then you'd wanna post a follow-up meeting where you basically ratify the action that was taken at the emergency.
 So let's hope for no emergencies.
 but just wanted to make sure everyone had that information as well.
 Conducting meetings.
 So we're gonna move a little bit from the notice piece of this and the agenda piece of the open meeting law to now how those meetings are conducted.
 These are topics that I often receive a lot of questions about.
 So I just wanted to make sure everyone had the best practices related to these particular topics of the open meeting law.
 We know that
 If the meeting is being recorded, similar to whether it be on Zoom or in person, that there should be a public statement or notification to the public through the technological means that the meeting minute is going to be recorded.
 And the basis of that is the Massachusetts wiretap statute.
 We can't secretly record anyone in Massachusetts.
 If an individual wants to record the meeting on their own, it's not otherwise recorded.
 So if someone shows up to an in-person meeting, it used to be when I started doing this, it would be the big, you know, the big recording device with a tripod that we had the old VCR tapes for.
 Now, of course, it's iPhones.
 The individual must inform the chair of their intent to do the recording.
 And then the chair would make the required announcement to the public body
 members as well as members of the public indicating that the meeting was going to be recorded.
 In my opinion, the chair can decide to reasonably regulate the recording placement.
 Obviously, as technology is smaller and smaller, this is less of an issue, but we don't want to block anyone's view, so to speak.
 And people can be in a position where they're not interrupting or there's no disorderly conduct in the meeting themselves.
 Any questions on recordings?
 Nope.
 Okay, thank you.
 Email.
 I would say, I'm going to try to do the math here.
 70 to 80% of the open meeting law complaints that I deal with relate to the use of email, text messages, or other social media mechanisms.
 So I say that again, we all use technology, it's efficient, it's quick,
 It garners a quick response and certainly, I'm sure you all use it, you know, in your other lives, professional lives, personal lives.
 But really, the open meeting law does not encourage the use of email or other text messages by members of the public body to conduct their business.
 Email is explicitly addressed in the open meeting law, and it is often the reason I see for a violation to be determined by the Attorney General's office.
 And what the law requires is that a quorum, either collectively, so reply all situation, or, you know, a group of individuals or one individual forwards it to another who forwards another, can constitute an open meeting law violation.
 Members should really be cautious and a best practice would be not to use email to share ideas, beliefs, opinions, concerns, whether serially or in a single email regarding business.
 And you can't use another member to, you can't send an email to a non-public body member to then circulate out to the group as well.
 Some practical approaches, certainly beware to reply all on emails and really limit
 the use of email to scheduling purposes only and try to avoid using it to undertake business.
 We should always assume that emails could be forwarded to, you know, a local blogger, put on Facebook, sent to the newspaper.
 I've seen it before.
 So we really want to be very considerate of the use of email.
 And this is where there is the overlap with the public records law
 because even if you're volunteers, emails or text messages or social media posts that are made in your official capacity or in relation to your service on this committee really are subject to the public records law as well.
 And so if you use a Gmail account or a personal cell phone to send an email or a text message, and there is a public records request for that,
 that certainly would be subject to the public records law, most likely.
 So just something to be very cognizant of as you begin your service.
 Is there a question?
 No, I think we're good.
 Okay, great.
 Thank you.
 Texting and social media, texting and social media, similar, also subject to the open meeting law.
 Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, Reddit, all of those are subject to the public records law and the open meeting law to the extent there is deliberation.
 If you are a user of social media, certainly in your individual capacity, you have free speech and first amendment considerations.
 So I'm not gonna speak directly to your individual rights, but certainly some practical approaches if you are posting on your service, you don't wanna direct comments to your other members,
 And if a matter directly involves issues pending, you might wanna consider not engaging.
 Certainly again, be thoughtful about the comments that are made and consider using separate accounts if you do run for something.
 Remember that applicants or any individual before you has due process rights.
 So certainly something to be cognizant of as well.
 The open meeting law,
 does not mandate, we're gonna talk a little bit about the authority of the chair in public comment, does not mandate that any particular person be allowed to speak at a meeting.
 So that's something we've seen a particular uptick in, both with respect to First Amendment auditors across the state, and also I'll talk a little bit about a case that came out last year that is really important.
 The open meeting law doesn't require that you even allow public participation or public comment, though I certainly understand that most public bodies do.
 The open meeting law indicates that the chair essentially has the sole discretion as to who may speak and for how long.
 So comments are directed through the chair, as you know.
 And while public comment isn't required under the open meeting law,
 allowing the public to speak during your meeting or restricting any speech, other than based on time, place, and manner restrictions, and we'll talk about what that means, does have serious constitutional implications.
 So certainly if you do allow public comment,
 all of the decisions as to who's going to speak or for how long should be content neutral.
 So not based on the particular message for a speaker or what that individual says, but just based on the time that's allotted.
 Some public bodies I work with say 15 minutes of public comment, everyone gets two or three minutes, people are allowed to speak once or twice depending on how busy the agenda is.
 And some have adopted public comment policies as well.
 So certainly something to put out there to all of you to consider.
 And we'll talk a little bit more about public comment, but the chair does have the authority to regulate it subject to those constitutional restrictions.
 Public participation, whether or not to allow public participation is a significant policy decision.
 here are a couple of factors for all of you to consider.
 When will the public participation period occur?
 Is it going to be at the beginning of the meeting?
 Is it going to be in the middle of the meeting or at the end of the meeting?
 How long will it be?
 You know, like I said, 10, 15 minutes is usually what I see, but there are some meetings where warrants particular input from members of the public.
 And so you all may decide a half an hour or an hour
 We just want to make sure it's equal across the board for anyone that wants to speak.
 How long will each person be allowed to speak and whether or not each person can speak more than once.
 So conducting the meeting, policy issues for public comment periods, any rules about public participation must relate to the process.
 such participation and cannot relate to any speech protected by constitutional principles.
 Any restrictions on an individual's speech must be narrowly tailored.
 So again, try to give some practical advice here, items to consider.
 During a public comment period, you certainly want to avoid a debate to the extent you can.
 You want to avoid responding before you've had the time or opportunity to discuss it or if the matter is controversial.
 And it is perfectly fine, both under the open meeting law, as well as under constitutional considerations, to just leave matters raised during public comment unresolved.
 They're not on the meeting agenda itself.
 And so it may be something that you decide to put on a
 a future meeting agenda so that members, the public that may be interested in the topic can come to the next meeting and say, okay, this is going to be reviewed.
 We're going to have an open discussion.
 We're going to be able to deliberate on it.
 So some practical items to consider there.
 Matters not reasonably anticipated by the chair that are going to be discussed by all of you must be added to the agenda.
 after the posting deadline to the extent feasible.
 And I'll give an example of that.
 If you are going to designate a staff member or someone else to work on your agenda, you wanna make sure that that person understands that it has to be added as soon as possible.
 And like we had talked about at the beginning with respect to the meeting notice, the updated agenda should show the original date as well as the date that it was changed.
 Matters not reasonably anticipated by the chair may be discussed and acted upon, but the Attorney General's Office does recommend, unless it requires immediate attention, it really should be put off to a later meeting and included in that meeting posting.
 So it really is, was this matter so time-sensitive, but yet unanticipated that it had to be discussed at this meeting?
 We updated the meeting agenda,
 and we're going to essentially discuss it, or can we put it off to the next meeting because it isn't time sensitive and it really could have been anticipated based on the totality of the circumstances.
 Any questions on any of that?
 I know it's a lot of content.
 Anything from any of the members?
 Looks like we're good so far.
 Okay, thank you so much.
 Meeting minutes, I don't know if you've all determined how the meeting minutes will be prepared or created and approved, but wanted to make sure, and I'll make these slides available to anyone that wants them after the meeting.
 I'll certainly circulate them so you have them as well as some other materials that may be helpful as a little open meeting log guide.
 The date, time, and place of the meeting and members present and absent does need to be included.
 You know, I get this question all the time.
 Are the meeting minutes a transcript?
 And the answer is no.
 What we know is it doesn't need to be a verbatim transcript of what transpired, particularly as I would imagine you're going to have longer meetings from time to time.
 What the attorney general's office has said and what the open meeting law requires is that it has to have a detailed summary of the discussion of each topic so that a member of the public sitting at home that goes to the website and looks at meeting minutes once they're drafted and approved says, okay, I understand what happened at this meeting, right?
 I understand this was the topic discussed.
 This is the general nature of the discussion.
 These were the votes that were taken.
 Here are the next steps.
 It can't be very cursory, but at the same time, it doesn't need to be a verbatim transcript.
 We do know that it should have the decisions made, any actions taken, and any votes recorded.
 You all did proper roll call vote at the beginning.
 If you are meeting in a remote capacity, you do want to do a roll call vote, and we'll talk about that in a little bit as well.
 The meeting minutes should also reference any documents or other exhibits that you use or consider during a meeting.
 They don't need to be attached to the meeting minutes, but we just want to reference them so that if there is a public records request or a request for those meeting minutes and all materials that you use during the meeting, someone can go back and figure out what was discussed and put the package together to then send to a member of the public.
 Meeting minutes do need to be approved and drafted in a timely manner.
 We know that that requires under the current regulations that that approval has to transpire within the next three meetings or within 30 days, whichever is later.
 There are several determinations that talk about, you know, staffing constraints or operational constraints alone aren't really a good reason for a delay in those approval of the meeting minutes.
 Certainly things happen.
 Everyone's busy and people are doing the best they can.
 My general advice and best practice is to try to stay on top of the drafting and approval of the meeting minutes as best as you can, given your other responsibilities.
 A question has come up very frequently in the last couple of years, can a public body use Google Docs or another document sharing mechanism to edit
 edit the meeting minutes in advance of a meeting to make that a more efficient process.
 And generally that is not allowed under the Open Meeting Law because if several members are going into Google Docs and sharing their comments outside of a public meeting, that could constitute a deliberation.
 It can be delegated, this task, to one individual.
 It's a matter of policy in terms of how you want to handle it in terms of efficiency, but there are different methods, so if you have any questions on that, feel free to let me know, and I'm happy to walk through it.
 Meeting minutes are
 Minutes of open meetings are public records as of the moment of their creation, regardless of whether they've been approved.
 So draft meeting minutes are subject to the public records law, just as approved meeting minutes are.
 Certainly personal notes, so if you take personal notes that are not shared as part of the public body's official files or the school department's files or the city's files, those are personal to you.
 And I would argue those are exempt under the public records law.
 But the meeting minutes, even in draft form, would be subject to disclosure.
 And there is a slightly shorter timeframe for a request for meeting minutes under the open meeting law.
 It's 10 calendar days.
 For a public records request response, it's 10 business days.
 So I just wanted to make sure you had that information as well.
 Executive session minutes.
 I don't know how much you all will meet an executive session, but certainly wanted to make sure everyone was aware of what an executive session is and how those meeting minutes differ from open session meeting minutes.
 The open meeting law allows public bodies to meet an executive or confidential session
 for specific reasons, those are all spelled out in Chapter 30A, Section 21.
 And I have many handouts on this.
 If anyone wants it, feel free to let me know.
 Happy to share it with all of you.
 Basically, if you all meet in executive session, either for litigation or real estate reasons, or there's a particular complaint, those are the most common reasons to go into executive session.
 There are specific requirements that apply.
 There must be notice.
 There need to be roll call votes.
 And those meeting minutes as opposed to the open session meeting minutes are confidential so long as that executive session purpose applies or there may be another reason to keep them confidential even after they're released under the public records law.
 Essentially, executive session meeting minutes can be withheld until that purpose has been met
 unless they're protected under the public records law.
 And the most common example of that is if you were meeting regarding, you know, threatened litigation or litigation that you were involved in, I hope that never happens, under Purpose 3 of the open meeting law, and you had counsel advising you at that meeting, the litigation settles, the, you know, there's no threat of litigation, all of that goes away.
 but the meeting minutes themselves may be able to be redacted under the attorney client privilege.
 So there is a little bit of overlap there with respect to the open meeting law process and the public records process.
 So just want to make sure everyone knew that.
 If you do meet an executive session, the open meeting law requires the chair or the chair's designee to review executive session meeting minutes routinely.
 I usually recommend quarterly just to see, can the meeting minutes be released?
 Has the purpose expired or not?
 And so that, to get in the habit of doing that, if you do end up meeting in executive session, I think is very helpful as things progress.
 Same timeframe in terms of a response, the 10 calendar days as well.
 Not that you need to release them, but just that a response be provided.
 Any questions on that so far?
 Nope, we're good.
 Thank you.
 I just want to check in every once in a while just to make sure.
 Executive sessions, if you do meet an executive session, you're going to first convene an open session.
 This question comes up all the time.
 Well, we're just having an executive session, Janelle.
 Like, what do you mean?
 Well, you have an open session, you start, and then the public sees you vote to go into executive session.
 That's what the open meeting law requires.
 You're going to announce the purpose of the executive session without compromising the reason.
 You know, this comes up more often, I would say, for land use boards, for instance, but if you had, if there was a threat of litigation and you didn't want to impact that at all, certainly may decide as a matter of policy, we can't discuss this.
 So something to be aware of.
 You're going to take and record a roll call to vote to go into executive session.
 and announce publicly whether or not you're going to return an open session or reconvene at all.
 Exhibits and documents are going to, again, be stored in reasonable proximity to the minutes so that we understand what the record of the meeting, what happened at the meeting, what transpired, and really only, I can't stress this enough, discuss the matters that are cited.
 So if you do feel as if you have a reason to go into executive session to discuss things secretly,
 And again, they're very narrow for the reasons you can do this.
 You really only wanna discuss those matters.
 You don't want the conversation of we are in a different direction that should be discussed in open session because I have dealt with open meeting law complaints alleging that when the minutes are released, everyone can see there was an open discussion of something else.
 So really be cognizant that you're only talking about what you can talk about in executive session.
 And again, it's 38 section 21, and the open meeting raw guide that I can circulate after this meeting goes through all of that in detail and there's a very helpful checklist that I have as well that I'm happy to provide to the committee as they conduct as you all conduct your work.
 I do get this question quite often, so I wanted to make sure you all knew.
 If an executive session is anticipated, it does need to be listed in appropriate detail on the meeting notice, again, without compromising your position, and the vote to enter into executive session must also be listed as well.
 You know, it's often that
 You have an open meeting and someone will say, well, can we go into executive session now?
 And the answer is most likely not.
 The same posting requirements apply unless there's an emergency or unanticipated item.
 So I wanted to cover, before we go into questions, and I'm happy to answer any questions that anyone has, a little bit of the enforcement process, just so you're all aware of it in case this ever comes up, and I hope it doesn't.
 You know, step one is if there was an open meeting law complaint that a written complaint be filed, there's a specific form within 30 days that someone found out about the alleged violation.
 And then from there, the public body would review the complaint, discuss a response and issue a response to the complainant along with any action that was taken.
 The complainant can essentially be satisfied and not do anything else and say, I'm completely content.
 with how the committee responded, or alternatively, they can say, I want further review with the Attorney General's Office.
 And the Attorney General's Office has a specific division, the Division of Open Government, that is charged specifically with enforcement of the open meeting law.
 There's a director of that division and several attorneys, and they essentially review open meeting law complaints to determine whether or not a violation has occurred.
 There are a variety of options.
 If there is a violation that the AG's office has, they can nullify the action that's taken.
 There are fines that can be imposed for intentional violations.
 There is also the option to go to court to seek further relief if an individual wants to.
 And then three registered voters can also bring an action in superior court.
 You know, I think the bottom line here is to really take those best practices and try to employ them to the extent you can.
 And if there's any questions along the way, better to ask at the beginning than to let it go further than that.
 Any questions so far?
 Nope.
 Nope, I think we're good.
 Okay, thank you.
 So I wanted to cover some recent notable court decisions.
 I've given a long summary here just so everyone has them.
 I think really the takeaway is the Barron case is a huge case that was recently decided by the SJC, the Supreme Judicial Court, which is the highest state court in the Commonwealth.
 And that really dealt with public comment periods.
 And essentially, in summary, the court held that while
 Municipalities are not required to provide public comments during board and committee meetings.
 If you are required to do so, they have to comply with the provisions of the constitution.
 So after this decision in South Borough, and I encourage you to all read it if you're interested, and I have a copy if anyone wants it, in my opinion, care should really be taken that any public comment period, like we talked about a couple of slides back,
 is limited to these reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions, rather than mandating quote-unquote civility or other content-based restrictions.
 You know, certainly this was a trend since the court reviewed this Corey Spaulding case versus Town of Natick School Committee back in 2018.
 closely tracked that case and the ACLU was involved in that litigation.
 That also dealt with public comments during public meetings where there were allegations the committee improperly limited comments made by members of the public, which were critical of the committee, but allowed other individuals to speak.
 If we look at these cases together, essentially, I think it makes sense to have a public comment policy or consistency across the board with respect to time,
 but regulation of content is really problematic in light of these decisions.
 So if there are specific questions of that, as you begin to conduct your business, certainly let me know.
 I'm happy to analyze that.
 I've worked on a lot of public comment policies since the Barron decision was decided.
 So happy to answer any questions that anyone has on that.
 I think practically speaking, most people do the time restrictions
 for public comment period and decide where in the meeting they're going to have public comment based on their other businesses, business for that meeting.
 I've included reference to two other cases.
 The Town of Swansea case was about sufficiency of meeting minutes.
 So I wanted to make sure you all had that as well.
 And then the Bolter versus Whelan case was really, and I don't know how much this would impact your work, but really dealt with employee evaluation processes.
 The current state of the open meeting law.
 So we know that the COVID-19 pandemic era changes are in place until March 31st, 2025.
 They were extended by Governor Healey in a supplemental budget bill that further extended those temporary measures.
 They were put in place in 2020 and extended several times.
 I just wanted to alert all of you that there is also significant pending legislation that would either seek to extend this further or make modifications to the open meeting law.
 I haven't heard it moving quickly at the state level, but certainly will keep
 All of you updated along the way, if there are changes, we would update, certainly update you, but for now, you can meet entirely in person, you can meet entirely remotely, or you can meet in a hybrid format.
 You know, I think instead of holding meetings in a public place, you can provide adequate alternative means, and we'll talk about what that means.
 Public body members can also participate in meetings remotely as well.
 The changes are still optional,
 There are technological considerations, we'll talk about that, but essentially the 2020 changes that were in place remain in effect through at least March 31st, 2025.
 And I would imagine there'll be further action on those in the next six months.
 Adequate alternative access, what does that mean?
 It means that if you are providing, if you are meeting remotely,
 you have to provide real-time access.
 A lag of about 20 seconds or so is deemed acceptable, but if there is a technical problem that prevents the meeting from being accessible, the stream crashes, the meeting should be paused or rescheduled depending on the severity of the technical issue.
 So there have been multiple determinations that
 The attorney general's office has held that continuing a meeting and posting a recording afterwards does not cure a violation if the meeting is fully remote.
 The public must be able to access the meeting as it happens.
 And again, this is if there's a remote meeting.
 If you're meeting entirely in person and you're providing a courtesy link or it's being live streamed as this is on,
 know Medford community then that requirement would not apply in my opinion.
 Zoom as we're here tonight is the typical means but it's not required.
 Any method that allows the public to follow in real time is acceptable in light of the remote meeting requirements.
 Additional considerations if you are meeting remotely
 you have to make a public statement that the meeting is being recorded, again, under the wiretap requirements.
 Votes should be taken with a roll call, just as we do in an executive session, and remote meeting, remote members, so if there are some people in person and there are some people at home, you must introduce yourselves or be introduced at the meeting, and the camera should be on to the extent that
 someone can have their camera on and they're not participating by phone or for medical reasons, they can't participate with their camera on or they've requested an accommodation.
 When holding an executive session remotely, members of the public body should state that no other person is present, that no one else can hear them.
 Again, that goes to the confidential nature of an executive session.
 And so if we were here tonight, I would say, you know, just so you know, I'm here in a room with the door shut in my office and no one else can hear me.
 That would be sufficient.
 Hybrid meetings.
 Many, I would say the majority of public bodies I work with are meeting in a remote or hybrid manner.
 You can allow
 your members to meet in person, but members of the public can watch a live stream.
 And you can also allow direct participants.
 So if you had a contractor or an engineer or a project manager to attend in person, but the general public could meet remotely.
 And a member may attend remotely if even if other members attend in person.
 The bottom line is essentially if live access stops,
 then the meeting must stop as well.
 If there is troubleshooting or technical difficulties, you do want to be careful, again, not to deliberate over text or email if there is an issue with a technical feed.
 And you can resume the meeting once it's resolved and members of the public are allowed to see the live stream again.
 Public body must be able to hear and follow the meeting from their remote location.
 Okay, so that was a little bit of a, I know a lot of information to take in.
 I'm happy to answer any specific questions that anyone has.
 As I had mentioned, I'm happy to share both these slides as well as additional resources as a open meeting law training kit with all of you and happy to answer any questions along the way.
 and update you with respect to the legislation on the open meeting law changes that may or may not go into effect by the end of next March.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=3948.703s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Mwen se Jenny Graham.
 Mwen se prezidan gwoup 25-moun sa a.
 Se konsa, di ou mèsi pou yo te isit la.
 Mwen gen de timoun nan lekòl la.
 Mwen te panse ou de ta ka manke pwojè sa a anvan li ale viv.
 Men, mwen gen yon anpil nan angajman nan kay la, se konsa isit la nou yo.
 Men, mwen reyèlman kap pou pi devan pou li.
 Nan travay jou mwen an, mwen posede yon konpayi konsiltasyon jesyon.
 Mwen te travay anpil nan amelyorasyon pwosesis, konsepsyon ak fournir edikasyon granmoun, ak jesyon pwojè.
 Mwen se yon manadjè pwojè sètifye, pa nan jaden an konstriksyon, men mwen konnen ki jan yo mennen yon gwo gwoup moun nan direksyon yon objektif.
 Se pou sa mwen la pou.
 Se konsa, yon anpil nan bagay sa yo Janelle te pale sou yo te wòl ke mwen te pran sou nan yon kèk minit.
 Nou pral diskite sou tout bagay sa yo nan kou kòmsadwa.
 Men, mwen eksite ke ou se tout isit la.
 Nou toujou gen anpil travay pou fè.
 Nou aktyèlman te fè yon anpil nan travay.
 Mwen kontan di ou sa.
 Se konsa, nou pral pale sou sa dwa apre prezantasyon an.</p>

 Timoun nan pi ansyen se nan setyèm ane nan Andrews, sè l 'se toujou nan Roberts, ak frè l' se toujou nan Roberts.
 Mwen devine mwen ta dekri tèt mwen kòm yon paran ki moun ki enterese ak motive nan amelyore anviwònman lekòl segondè a pou nou ka evite gen pou pran desizyon difisil pita.
 Mwen panse ke petèt mwen te konsantre twòp sou bagay sa yo.
 Se poutèt sa mwen te fè yon anpil nan rechèch, kèk nan li byen
 Mwen pa ta di mwen abitye avèk li, men mwen konnen travay sa yo konplèks ka jwenn nan tras ak pran plis tan pase yo ta dwe.
 Epi, ou konnen, pwofesyonèl, mwen se yon enjenyè sistèm.
 Mwen travay nan endistri avyon an epi mwen abitye avèk konpleksite ak pwosesis konsantre.
 Natirèlman, ou konnen, mwen panse ke wòl mwen se jis poze kesyon
 Pwoblèm etranj.
 Mwen konnen nou gen anpil moun isit la ki travay dirèkteman pou lekòl yo oswa ki gen lyen pre ak distri lekòl la.
 Se konsa, petèt ou pral gade nan yon pwoblèm patikilye soti nan yon pèspektiv diferan ak bay li yon vwa.
 Petèt li pral pwodiktif.
 Petèt li te jis yon moso nan espageti ki glise sou miray la.
 Men, mwen panse ke se wòl mwen isit la, yon wòl deyò men sètènman motive yo pote yon nouvo lekòl segondè nan Medford.
 Mèsi.</p>

 Bon pou wè anpil non.
 Mwen jis reyalize mwen pa janm wè figi ou.
 Men, mwen te ap travay nan vil la nan biwo acha Medford a pou sèt ane, ak sa a te yon gwo opòtinite.
 Genyen yon anpil nan bon bagay k ap pase nan vil la nan Medford, ak mwen pa soti nan Medford, se konsa mwen kontan ak eksite sou tout pwojè yo ki ap pase.
 Sa a se yon gwo bagay.
 Mwen menm mwen te soti nan yon kominote kote nou bati yon nouvo lekòl presegondè ak lekòl segondè nan 2015, ak mwen sou lòt bò a nan li.
 Mwen se plis nan yon moun ekstansyon, k ap travay pou Vil la nan North Lekti, men nan yon kapasite diferan.
 Mwen ka di li se yon gwo pwogram, yon sistèm lekòl gwo, pitit fi mwen te premye moun ki gradye ak pitit gason m 'gradye la.
 Mwen vrèman te vle pote l 'isit la, Medford se vo li.</p>

 Mwen sitou konsantre sou pwogramasyon an ak premye konsepsyon konsepsyon yon pati nan pwojè a, men mwen tou swiv yon anpil nan konsèp yo bati.
 Mwen gen de jèn timoun, twa ak senk, se konsa mwen eksite

 Fè pati nan pwosesis la.
 Anplis de sa, mwen te anseye matematik setyèm ane pou yon peryòd de tan anvan mwen te kòmanse edikasyon mwen ak karyè nan achitekti.

 Mwen trè eksite.</p>

 Sa a se premye wòl dirijan mwen an.
 Se poutèt sa mwen santi mwen konsa chans pou kapab ede bati yon nouvo lekòl pou elèv nou yo pandan premye ane mwen isit la, paske yo vrèman merite li.
 Mwen pa gen okenn eksperyans nan konstriksyon oswa bilding travay tankou nenpòt nan ou gen.
 Men, sa mwen ka fè se imajine ki kalite espas elèv nou yo, pwofesè yo, ak anplwaye ta bezwen nan Medford High School.
 Mwen vrèman eksite fè sa paske mwen panse ke nou ka reyèlman
 Ansèyman davans ak aprantisaj pa kreye espas pou kolaborasyon ak inovasyon.

 Mwen aktyèlman renmen bilding yo fin vye granmoun, e mwen renmen otobis la Curtis, men mwen konnen li pa fèt pou elèv yo.
 Se poutèt sa mwen te tèlman eksite pou vin yon pwofesè lekòl segondè, yon direktè nan Vermont, yon direktè nan Western Massachusetts, North Shore a, ak Lè sa a, yon lekòl charter.
 Mwen toujou nan fen yon travay oswa k ap travay nan direksyon pou li.
 Mwen se yon elèv nan Middlebury, Vermont, e mwen te wè sa rive.
 Nou tout te mete bòt ak frè m 'te kapab jwi benefis ki genyen nan bilding lan nouvo.
 Mwen santi mwen tankou mwen toujou nan eta orijinal la.
 oswa nan fen yon bagay.
 Mwen panse ke se reyèlman enteresan.
 Mwen panse ke se pa tout vil la gen kapasite nan bati bilding lekòl nouvo ak reflechi sou lavni an, espesyalman elèv yo ke mwen ap travay ak kounye a, yo bay elèv nou yo ak aksè nan ekite, kapital, ak resous kiltirèl, ki mwen panse ki pral yo dwe reyèlman enpòtan.
 Mwen renmen sa Jenny rele "coworking," oswa moun ki te vini ak li, mwen renmen li paske Enstiti Curtis nou an nan teknoloji elèv yo reyèlman pral fè pati nan bilding sa a nan lavni.

 Bonswa, Marissa Parkinson.
 Mwen te fèt tou nan menm lari a nan Lawrence.
 Fanmi mwen ak manman m 'yo toujou isit la, dwa nan lari yo nan West Medford.

 Mwen te kòmanse nan yon lekòl bonè.
 Mwen te pran yon chemen diferan.
 Mwen te fini nan S.

 Mwen se yon Katolik devwe, men ou konnen, mwen te travay nan Mèt Manje Johnny a nan Westlake.

 Sa a se repons pi renmen m 'yo.
 Se konsa, mwen devine mwen gen fè ajisteman.
 Men, mwen vrèman eksite sou sa li vle di.
 Bati yon nouvo lekòl segondè pou Medford.
 Mwen konnen lè bilding sa a te bati, li te tankou, ou konnen, pwobableman tankou Taj Mahal la.
 Se te yon bèl lekòl.
 Men, ou konnen, 50-plis ane pita, nou bezwen yon bagay nouvo.
 Mwen panse ke elèv nou yo merite li.
 Nou gen yon pwogram karyè gwo.
 Nou gen bèl pwogram akademik, men nan yon bilding trè fin vye granmoun.
 Nou gen yon bèl pwojè Curtis House ki sitiye nan yon etablisman diferan.
 Nou ofri bèl edikasyon timoun piti ak pwogram lekòl matènèl bay anplwaye nou yo isit la.
 Nou gen chans gen bagay sa yo nan Medford.
 Mwen panse ke Medford se yon ti kras GEM.
 Èske w gen yon nouvo bato lekòl segondè pral fè anpil pou elèv nou yo, kominote nou yo ak lavni nan kominote nou an kòm yon antye.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=4748.33s">[Jenny Graham]</a>:  Sure.
 Thank you all for the...
 words of excitement.
 I want to do a couple of things between now and 8pm and we're going to be out the door at 8, I promise.
 But just as a quick time check, two big things.
 One is I want to give you a bit of a sense of what's been happening.
 to lead up to today and where we are in the process.
 So I'm going to talk a little bit about that.
 We're going to bring up a quick presentation to do that.
 And then before we leave tonight, we will form some subcommittees so that we can move quickly on some of the near-term work that we need to do.
 So we'll talk about that in just a minute.
 But Peter, if you can bring up that presentation for me, that would be great.
 OK.
 You can go ahead a couple of pages.
 Keep going, one more.
 Here we go.
 Back in February, we started, so in December, the MSBA invited us to the eligibility period.
 And we'll talk about what the eligibility period means in just a couple of minutes.
 But that invitation said, you're invited to this process, which starts on May 1st.
 So tomorrow we start.
 However, the committee named me the chair of this building committee back in February, and there's a lot of work that has been done so far.
 One of the things that we had to do was find all of you, right?
 So in the context of trying to say, what is it that we want as a school committee for this building committee to do, we established a list of goals.
 There's going to be many, many more goals, but I did want to set the stage of,
 the work that we're going to do for the next five to seven years.
 The first is to plan comprehensively for all programming currently residing on the Medford High School campus, including vocational and non-vocational 9-to-12 education, 9-to-12 athletics, the Medford Family Network, Medford Community Schools programming, early childhood education, including, but not limited to, the Medford Early Education Program, which we call MEAP, and Kids' Corner.
 So there's so much more that goes on in this building than what we think about when we think about a high school.
 So that's one thing for you all to start to think about.
 Number two, what's that?
 Can I take it?
 Oh yeah, and I can share the slides.
 No, no, I can share the slides.
 Yeah, I can share all the slides with you afterwards.
 Number two is to consider whether the placement of Curtis Tufts High School on the Medford campus will provide increased educational opportunities to enrolled students at Curtis Tufts.
 Number three, ensure robust public input and stakeholder feedback and appropriate milestones throughout the project that complies with MSBA guidelines and guidance from the Medford School Committee.
 Listen to educator and administrator input regarding the future of educational best practices and plans for the students of Medford.
 That means we care a lot about functionality.
 So we wanna know that the spaces will work for the students and the teachers in the building.
 It's really, really important.
 Number five, create plans for the building that advances Medford's climate goals and achieves any CHIPS and LEED 5, LEED version 5 certification to meet the Paris Climate Accords 2030 and 2050 targets, and moves efficiently and effectively through the building process in a manner that ensures students are able to learn in the new building as quickly as is feasible.
 So that's a huge task.
 as quickly as is feasible is still measured in years and not in months.
 But in the context of building this committee, once I was designated the chair, we got out the call for applications, we started to collect applications, and all of you are here.
 Meanwhile, there's a lot of work to do in the eligibility phase that we've already begun.
 So we'll talk about that in just a minute.
 But if you can go to the next slide.
 So this is a
 really junky graphic that did not blow up very well from the SBA website.
 But as we're talking about the entire process, right, we are just outside the box for another like six hours.
 On May 1st, we'll hop inside the box into that eligibility period.
 At each of these steps in the process,
 The MSBA will have to sign off that we have completed all of the requirements of that phase.
 There will have to be a board meeting where they vote to invite us to the next phase.
 So at any point in this process, the MSBA could say, you're not ready to move on.
 They could also say, we don't like what you're doing.
 And they could also say, forget about it.
 So our job here is that none of those things happen.
 Our job is that we are going to play this clean, we are going to be comprehensive, and we are going to move as fast as we humanly can.
 Okay, so we're going to give the MSBA a run for their money because we're going to be ready for them.
 Well, we'll see.
 But that eligibility period lasts for 270 days.
 So by January, we have to be done with the eligibility phase.
 I'm going to talk a little bit about what happens in that phase.
 Beyond the eligibility phase, just briefly, when we talk about forming the project team, that means bringing on board our owner's project manager.
 then we go into the feasibility study.
 When people think about what we're doing on this committee, they think we're doing a feasibility study right now.
 They think we're deciding, are we building?
 Are we renovating?
 Where are we building?
 Is it on the field?
 Is it in the parking lot?
 How's it going to work?
 We are not there yet.
 So please tell all your friends
 We will get there and we will work with professionals to help make those assessments on behalf of what we need to do in this building.
 And then we'll move on to schematic design, funding the projects.
 That is where we vote as a community to fund this project.
 I cannot stress how important that will be, but also we've got a lot of work to do before we get there.
 Once that happens, we go into detailed design, then we put a shovel in the ground, and then at some point in future, we complete the project.
 So that's sort of the soup to nuts.
 My goal is that we're just going to take this one step at a time.
 We're going to do what we need to do to be compliant with the eligibility period, and then we're going to move on.
 As we near that next phase, we're going to start talking about how can we accelerate the work.
 But for right now, our focus is eligibility.
 So if you can flip to the next page.
 The eligibility process is its own graphic, which you cannot see.
 So go ahead and flip to the next slide.
 Okay.
 So there are five things that have to happen in this phase.
 One is the initial compliance certification.
 It's a legal agreement that binds the city to comply with the MSBA's process.
 It has been signed and it has been delivered to the MSBA.
 We are one day ahead of schedule and I'm going to own that.
 Thank you, Mayor and Superintendent.
 We're on our way.
 Number two, the building committee has to be formed.
 You're all here.
 The school committee said meet before May 1st and here we are on April 30th.
 We've done it.
 The form will be submitted to the MSBA shortly.
 So we are working on that and that'll be submitted shortly.
 That's obviously the easy part.
 It's paperwork.
 I think
 The whole eligibility phase is a lot of paperwork, but this is the easy stuff.
 And we're just going to get it done and get it out of the way.
 The MSBA will need to sign off on our committee.
 We have met all the requirements.
 So the MSBA has all kinds of things that it requires of us in terms of who is on this committee.
 We've met all of those requirements with all of you here.
 Now we're going to dive into the actual work.
 There's three additional things that have to happen.
 One is what they call an educational profile.
 It's a template document, and it requires us to say, what happens in this building today?
 How many classrooms?
 How many math classrooms?
 How many swing spaces?
 How big is your theater?
 All of it, right?
 So it asks you to describe currently what happens in this building.
 It also asks you to describe what you envision for the future of this building.
 So this is where those conversations about Curtis Tufts, those conversations about early childhood become very, very important.
 Because between our statement of interest and this eligibility phase, educational profile, that will set the tone for how all the construction professionals actually can do their work.
 So this is going to set the scope, as it were, for the work that has to be done to actually get this building put up.
 So there's a lot of work that's been done right now in this process.
 I have been meeting with the administrative team since February.
 We meet multiple times a week.
 They're very sick of me.
 I would be sick of me.
 But one of the things that we have started to do is say, what can we chip away at?
 And so the document is pretty well drafted when it comes to
 What do we do in this building?
 All the classrooms have been counted.
 All the programs have been outlined.
 There's a little bit more work for the administration to do in terms of what happens today to accurately describe that.
 The other thing that is obviously much more complicated is having some conversation around what will we do in this building in the future?
 So in that conversation, again, we've been having a lot of sort of broad conversation.
 We've been sort of tapping into like the strategic planning parts of our brain to ask big questions, and I'm going to use Curtis Tufts just for a quick minute.
 We have had some discussion about do our educators think that is something that we should be thinking about and the answer to that is yes, they said, yes, we should be thinking about that.
 And so we started to say okay what does that look like what might.
 the requirements be.
 So we've started that conversation, but that conversation is bigger than what this committee can sort of chew on because it sort of dabbles in responsibilities of the school committee.
 So last night I served up a resolution asking our special education and behavioral health subcommittee, which is actually chaired by member Rousseau, to have a meeting on a very tight timeline to collect input and feedback
 about that very narrow topic.
 Would co-location of the Curtis-Tufts onto this campus in some capacity be beneficial to the educational outcomes of the students that go to Curtis-Tufts?
 There is another Medford resident who actually spoke last night.
 He is in charge of a very comparable program at Somerville.
 He talked about this transition just happening in Somerville and how it exploded his population.
 It has changed the game for the students who need that alternative setting in terms of access to things like sports teams, in our case, the vocational programs.
 So there's huge, huge opportunity, but
 We want to make sure that the community and the committee have some opportunity to sort of think about all that that might bring to the table and provide a recommendation back to this committee.
 So that has been turfed.
 Last night, officially, to the Special Education Subcommittee, they will meet.
 They will invite current staff, current students, former students,
 community members, etc, etc.
 And Jack Hevery from Somerville to come and talk and work through that and provide a recommendation.
 So they're on their way, that will come back by mid-June.
 So they have their work cut out for them, but that will help us inform
 the drafting of that piece of what we envisioned for this school.
 Because what we likely will need is not just a couple of classrooms somewhere in the building.
 Part of why the Curtis Tufts is successful is because the environment is considerably different than this very, very big campus with 1,200 students.
 So we will have to think carefully about how we craft that.
 But hopefully, the work that the subcommittee does will come back to us and can be sort of funneled in.
 Marta and Chad will come to a future school committee meeting in the coming weeks and Marta will be talking about some of her ideas for alternative programming and what all that might look like even in the short term.
 And so that is something that will have to be sort of folded in.
 Joan and Suzanne and I and Paul had a conversation yesterday about early education.
 Our elementary schools are busting at the seams.
 We'll have to grapple with that problem sometime.
 MEEP used to be housed here.
 And we are going to explore a case that says MEAP should come back here.
 And that may or may not be ultimately where we land, but that is something that we're exploring because now is the time.
 We also talked a lot about
 students who don't have any sort of pre-k education, and as they enter our public schools, just how challenging the entry for those students are.
 And so we are also talking about things like how big is the wait list, and how many students come to us who have never been in some sort of pre-k setting, and what kind of capacity would we need to service a bigger, more comprehensive early education program out of this building, because all of that would need to go into this document.
 So we are working on that.
 So as these things are happening, there's been a lot of work to date on this educational profile.
 The one big piece of educational profile we haven't touched yet is the communication strategy.
 I'll talk about that in just a minute.
 But on the education side, there's so much that our educators have to do for us to be able to get that document pulled together.
 I just want you all to know it's all in process and as we go through our next several meetings we'll bring those documents forward so we can start to do like broader reading of those documents, ask for suggestions, make sure that we are really thinking about all the angles of what we need to describe and so that is where I think all of you play a really important role to say
 I think you need to describe what we're doing here a little bit differently based on what I know or based on sort of what the vision is for the arts programs or for the vocational programs, et cetera, et cetera.
 So that's where we are on the educational profile.
 Curtis Tuft's co-location is in subcommittee.
 The other big sort of newer, newish, changing topic is MEEP.
 What MSBA describes as the reason for delay often in communities is that they're having to make very big decisions that feed their building process.
 Like, do we combine two schools?
 And so that obviously has its own energy and its own set of requirements, which makes it very challenging to be able to move quickly.
 So we are trying to both think very big because this is
 a one-shot opportunity to think about what the district really does need in a very comprehensive way, but also move as fast as possible.
 So all that work has been in progress and moving as quickly as is humanly possible.
 Peter, can you go to the next slide?
 Very similarly on the vocational side, because we have a very active vocational school, we have another document that needs to be filled out, which is a Chapter 74 viability.
 Chapter 74 is the chapter of the regulation that establishes vocational programs, right?
 OK.
 That drafting is in progress.
 We have to tell them, here are the programs we have.
 Here is the capacity of those programs.
 Here is our current enrollment.
 And things like, what is our wait list?
 We also have an opportunity to describe intended expansion of these programs.
 Chad and Peter will be at the school committee talking about potential for expansion.
 That is a school committee matter because expanded program takes much more than just a building.
 It takes equipment, it takes staffing.
 So the school committee has to weigh in on that.
 So that's gonna come before the school committee on May 20th, and that will feed sort of the finalization of
 the chapter 70 form and and this group will read through and sort of get ready for that as well.
 Um, and then there is a piece, um, of the puzzle, which, um, the mayor and the superintendent and I are talking to MSBA about later this week, which is really information around city planning.
 So we can start to, um, feed information into what they call their enrollment study that helps size the building.
 So you've probably heard a lot about this building was built for 4,000 students, and now there's only 1200 that.
 Whether 4,000 was the number or not, I don't know, but it is true that the number is different.
 And so one of the things that the MSBA will do in the eligibility phase is they will say, we're going to build a building for this many students.
 That usually tracks with something like what happens in the building today.
 However, if there's huge planned expansion in the city in terms of housing units going up for development, they're going to want to know all of that.
 So that they can size the building because they don't want us to build a building that is immediately out of capacity.
 They also don't want us to build a building that will never be at capacity, right so so that's some of the work that's happening there.
 Fourth thing, maintenance documents.
 There's a questionnaire that we have to answer that outlines all of our maintenance practices across the district.
 So it's things like, do you do recommissioning?
 And how is your staff trained?
 There's like 20 variables.
 That document is also in draft and moving along as quickly as is humanly possible.
 We'll get to that probably a little bit later in June.
 Final thing that we need to do to be considered done with eligibility is we have to identify funding for the feasibility study, which is probably somewhere in the neighborhood of two and a quarter to two and a half million dollars.
 We're not ready for that yet, but we're making plans.
 The mayor and I are working on what will that plan be from a financial task force perspective, so that that money can be accounted for and cared for as quickly as it is required to be.
 questions about the process.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5920.302s">[Preisner]</a>: sètènman.
 Se konsa, lè ou di manda lokal yo, sa vle di votè yo pa vote?
 Non.
 Oswa èske sa vle di
 rich.
 Vil la idantifye finansman.
 Kòrèk.
 Ranbousman konplè, yon pati nan ki pral ranbouse.
 Men, mwen panse otorizasyon an dwe pou tout kantite lajan an.
 Kòrèk.
 FDA a pral di w ki sa ranbousman ou yo pral baze sou ki kote ranbousman an.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5944.979s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Kòrèk.
 Se konsa, an tèm de posibilite, finansman an gen yo kouvri tout depans sa yo nan etid la posibilite.
 Pa pwojè a tout antye, jis etid la posibilite, ki koute ant $ 2 ak $ 2.5 milyon dola.
 Vil la pral peye pou etid la tout posibilite inicio.
 Lè sa a, yon fwa MSBA a sètifye pousantaj ranbousman pwojè nou yo ak nou gen siksè nan tout pwosesis la, yo pral ranbouse rapò a etid posibilite nan pwopòsyon ak pousantaj la alokasyon yo bay nou.
 Se konsa, wi, wi.
 Yo pral sèvi ak fòmil la menm ak aplike li nan etid la posibilite ak ranbouse lavil la.
 Men, lavil la gen fè fas ak lajan an.
 Se konsa, sa ki dwe rive isit la se
 Nou dwe fè sa.
 Si nou dwe ale deyò epi yo eli votè yo jwenn lajan sa a, nou dwe fè sa.
 Nou pa prevwa bezwen fè sa.
 Nou gen yon plan finansman pou sa a epi li ta dwe pa gen okenn pwoblèm.
 Se konsa, nou ap fè yon bon travay ak sa, epi li mande pou yon konsèy vil vote otorize lajan sa yo, li mete yo nan yon plas kote nou ka itilize yo.
 Men, nou te nan bon fòm la.
 Kòm mwen mansyone, sa a ta dwe tout dwe ranpli pa janvye.
 Chak gen yon dat limit espesifik ki asosye ak li.
 Mwen ta di yo trè agresif ke mwen vle jwenn tout bagay sa yo fè anvan lekòl kòmanse ane pwochèn.
 Chak fwa sa posib, mwen ta renmen bagay sa yo yo dwe ranpli a 30 jen.
 Oke, Se poutèt sa nou vini ansanm ak travay di ak pouse.
 Um, mwen panse, um, etann enpòtan pou nou.
 Se konsa, kite a lonje epi pou yo jwenn tou pare.
 Oke, MSBA a toujou gen kèk travay fè an tèm de ap resevwa sètifye nan etid matematik ak sou sa, men mwen espere ke nou ka bay yo ak tout bagay yo bezwen pou nou ka jwenn nan pwochen nivo pi vit ke posib.
 Kesyon sou orè.
 Ok
 Se konsa, nou sèlman gen 20 minit kite.
 Pou sa ka fèt, nou te ki nan lis yon seri de reyinyon kap vini soukomite nan fen ajanda la.
 Gen de bagay mwen espere ke nou konsidere ak priyorite jan nou fè fas ak pwoblèm nan
 Antre nan premye etap sa a.
 Youn nan sa yo se Komite Kominikasyon ak Kominote Kominote.
 Mwen ta renmen gen kèk kalite soukomite komite, pa plis pase sèt manm vòt yo, men yon gwoup ki enterese ki vini ansanm kòm yon soukomite nan reyèlman kapab dekri ak dekri pwosesis angajman kominote nou an.
 Mwen panse ke ou tout wè enkyetid eksprime pa moun ki nan kominote a: Èske Medford pral vis moute?
 Èske sa ap travay?
 Sa pral rive?
 Se konsa, ou bezwen fè yon anpil nan kontak nan kominote a.
 Pi bonè nou kòmanse, plis siksè nou pral nan fen an.
 Sepandan, mwen panse ke sa a se yon konvèsasyon pi laj paske, nan opinyon mwen, nou genyen
 Divès komite ak komite.
 Anpil nan yo enterese nan pwojè sa a.
 Se konsa, li nesesè fè kèk kontak yo konprann ki lè ak ki jan yo angaje yo pou nou ka enkòpore li nan plan mèt nan lavni.
 Dezyèm gwoup la mwen vle fòme aswè a se Komite Règ ak Kòporasyon yo.
 Kòm Janelle te di, nou bezwen gen kèk règleman sou ki jan sa a ap travay, espesyalman alantou patisipasyon piblik, men jis jeneralman.
 Mwen espere ke komite sa a pral limite nan tan.
 Mwen espere ou ka jwenn ansanm yon fwa epi pote yon bouyon nan gwoup sa a ak Lè sa a, nou ka adopte règleman yo, epi jere soti nan la.
 Lè sa a, twazyèm komite a pa pral rankontre konsa byento, men li pral rankontre,
 Gen yon soukomite finans anvan fen mwa jen.
 Li pral Lè sa a, vin yon komite kanpe ki pral rankontre ak kontinye pandan tout lavi a nan pwojè a.
 Li se vo anyen ke lè kominote a vote,
 Komite sa a se pa kote pou fè travay sa a.
 Se konsa, si nou ap pale sou bezwen nan ultim pou esklizyon dèt finanse pwojè sa a, komite sa a se pa plas la pou nou apwouve esklizyon dèt.
 An reyalite, ki pa ka rive isit la.
 Li te rive deyò nan gwoup sa a.
 Um, se konsa komite sa a finans, mwen panse ke li nan plis sou, um, bay enfòmasyon, um, ak Sur nan bagay sa yo tankou akizisyon, done, um, ki soti nan administratè pwojè pwopriyetè nou an, um, ki soti nan achitèk nou yo, sa yo kalite bagay sa yo, um, ak tou ede enfòme, tankou, sa ki nesesè yo amann-melodi viabilité nou an.
 Èske gen lòt depans nou ta dwe konsidere?
 Se konsa, gen nan toujou kèk travay finansye fè ...
 Ou konnen, mwen pa atann gwoup sa a jwenn ansanm jouk pita nan mwa me.
 Se konsa, nou pral pale plis sou règleman Robert a nan lòd ak tout lòt bagay nan pwochen reyinyon an.
 Mwen konnen, tout moun ap gade m ', tanpri sispann pale.
 Gen 8.
 Se konsa, mwen devine kisa mwen enterese nan se si nenpòt moun ki koute bagay sa a epi li di, "Mwen reyèlman vle fè yon pati nan sa a
 Ou se yon manm nan sou -komite sa yo, ou ka idantifye tèt ou?
 Mwen ta tou politès konseye administratè lekòl yo peye fèmen atansyon, menm jan ou gen travay ou koupe soti pou ou pou w prepare tèt ou pou rès la nan sa nou jis dekri.
 Lè sa a, ou se 100% akeyi.
 Patisipe, men nou pral bezwen ou ale nan komite lekòl la.
 Nou bezwen èd nan men Jan ak Pyè ak plan antretyen elatriye.
 Se konsa, si nenpòt moun ki enterese nan nenpòt ki lòt sijè, komite a pa ka tankou gwo jan li bezwen yo dwe, men li ka tankou gwo jan nou panse ke li bezwen yo dwe pou kapab fè travay la.
 Se konsa, mwen mete sa yo sou -komite sou kalandriye mwen an.
 Aswè sa yo nou pral rankontre antyèman atravè Zoom, jis fè bagay sa yo yon ti kras pi fasil.
 Men, ou konnen, chak nan nou pral gen yon rezilta trè espesifik pou pwochen reyinyon an sou Me 13, ki se prezante pwopozisyon bouyon ou.
 Èske gen nenpòt volontè?
 Wi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6321.323s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: pou de lòt yo.
 Konbyen yo espesifye?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6325.707s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Mwen panse ke li ta ka nenpòt ki kantite moun.
 Nimewo a nan manm vòt yo pa dwe depase sèt.
 Men, mwen panse ke si nou te elimine tout anplwaye lekòl la, mwen pa twò enkyete ke nou ta dwe nan yon sitiyasyon tankou sa a.
 Men, mwen plis enterese nan moun ki fè bagay yo ke yo santi yo apwopriye pou travay la yo fè, pou travay la yo renmen.
 Mèsi.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6367.334s">[Libby Brown]</a>: Mwen vle di, mwen te kapab mete de nan la ak wè si gen nan ase kominikasyon oswa finans.
 Ok
 Ok</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6374.859s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Mwen pral mete ou nan finans.
 Ki jan li son?

 Èske mwen tande yon bagay?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6381.976s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: Ok</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6385.438s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: ak Fiona, finans.
 Èske nou ka aplike tou pou finansman nan men Bob?
 Eksepsyonèl.
 Wi, wi, absoliman wi.
 Èske nenpòt lòt moun ki enterese nan komite sa yo?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6402.244s">[Preisner]</a>: Si ou pa ka jwenn ase finansman.
 Oke, mwen pral mete ou sou lis la.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6412.739s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Règ ak entegrasyon gen de moun.
 Sa a dwat.
 Mwen te planifye yo chita sou tout komite, men petèt nou te ka mande Emily Lazzaro yo chita sou règleman yo ak soukomite komite.
 Oke, mwen pral tcheke avè l ', men mwen gen tou Nicole Morell sou soukomite a kominikasyon.
 Se konsa, nou pral pale ak yo, men nenpòt lòt moun gen yon opinyon fò oswa vle ale?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6447.185s">[Aaron Olapade]</a>: Oke, gwo.
 Oke, mwen te pral di finans, men mwen reyèlman pa gen yon anpil eksperyans nan nan zòn sa a.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6455.601s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Mwen panse ke nou bon.

 Non, ou toujou gen travay fè.
 Oh, absoliman.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6461.327s">[Parkinson]</a>: Mwen panse ke pou tout antrenè yo reyèl sou ekip la</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6470.157s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Anvan nou fouye nan pwoblèm sa a, pral gen yon gwoup k ap travay ki te mete ansanm yon demann pou pwopozisyon pou manadjè pwojè mèt kay la.
 Sa a se pa eksperyans mwen.
 Se pa poukisa mwen isit la.
 Se konsa, sou tan, nou pral konte sou tout moun ki fòme diferan sou -komite.
 Soti nan yon pèspektiv pèsonèl, sa a se kote mwen panse ke nou ta dwe kòmanse.
 Èske sa fè sans?
 Nenpòt moun ki gen nenpòt lòt sijesyon pou yon bagay ki bezwen rive ASAP?
 Mwen gen yon kesyon.
 sètènman.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6499.089s">[Larry Brown]</a>: Ou mansyone Curtis ke yo te kapab vini isit la ak tout itilizasyon sa yo diferan pou etablisman an.
 Ki moun ki ap eksplore opsyon sa yo?
 Menm jan ak edikasyon kominotè, petèt ap travay nan yon kolèj kominotè, klas aswè, tankou mwen espere fè nan AGC Jeneral kontraktè Asosyasyon ki bay edikasyon pou granmoun.
 Nenpòt moun ki renmen li?
 Vini ak yon anpil nan opsyon ke ou ta renmen konsidere oswa ki sa yo lide ou a?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6534.345s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Wi, plis oswa mwens pa, men se pa byen.
 Nou poko la.
 Se konsa, mwen te panse li ta ka fè sans pou nou ajoute sa a yon fwa nou jwenn sou ront inisyal la nan jwèt la chapit 74.
 Se konsa, jan nou kòmanse li dokiman sa yo, mwen panse ke li lè yo di: Ki lòt moun nou ta dwe peye atansyon a?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6554.235s">[Larry Brown]</a>: Paske tout kalite bagay sa yo gen yon enpak
 Aksè, pwoksimite, relasyon ant enstalasyon, espas depo, gwosè espas pou pakin, ou konnen.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6563.741s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Oke, wi, mwen panse ke se yon bon lide.
 Mwen pral mete l 'sou lis la.
 Wi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6568.884s">[Ruseau]</a>: An reyalite, nou limite pa vil la.
 Yo ye.
 Si tout moun nan sal la te di: Federal Rec ta dwe isit la.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6577.15s">[Parkinson]</a>: Li pa nan vil la.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6585.563s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Men lekòl kominotè yo ye.
 Se konsa, wi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6595.083s">[Preisner]</a>: Ok
 Yeah, mwen vle mande, ki moun ki pral bay kèk kalite enfrastrikti dijital pou komite sa a?
 Se konsa, mwen pral refere a SOI.
 Gen soi.
 Gen rechèch entegre nan sa a SOI.
 Gen pouvwa pou yon seri antye nan lòt dokiman piblik ki pa aktyèlman disponib nan piblik la, men yo ta dwe.
 Ou konnen, sa a kominote angajman Kominikasyon soukomite a pral responsab pou:
 Pwobableman kominike menm bagay la nan yon anpil nan moun.
 Wi, sa a se pi efikasman fè nan yon sit entènèt (petèt nan yon repozitwa pataje), e se sètènman aksesib deyò.
 Ou konnen, yon pòtal tankou yon sit entènèt, tankou tout lekòl ki gen youn nan pwogram sa yo, ak Lè sa a, yon kalite repozitwa entèfas kote Sheldon ka aprann poukisa, pou egzanp, li ta ka ouvè a manm nan nenpòt ki lè oswa, ou konnen, sou yon lis cho.
 sètènman.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6657.678s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Mwen ka ba ou yon ajou.
 Nou gen sa.
 Se konsa, nou te resevwa yon URL inik nan komite a, ki se buildingmhs.org.
 Èske se konsa?
 Ok
 Se poutèt sa, URL la egziste.
 Paj sa a egziste.
 An reyalite, Thomas ap etidye estrikti de baz resous kominote sa a.
 Rezon ki fè la nou ap mande tout moun yo bay yon bio ak yon foto se paske yo ap tout pral pibliye sou sit entènèt la, se konsa li te ap travay sou tout nan sa ki nan kapasite li kòm direktè kominikasyon.
 Tom te dakò ke, byenke li se direktè kominikasyon sortan, li pral kontinye konsantre sou pwojè sa a jiskaske nou anboche siksesè li.
 Se konsa, Thomas ak kèk nan elèv edikasyon pwofesyonèl nou yo ap bati sit entènèt sa a, mwen panse ke anba pedagojik la nan Lisa Miller.
 Apre sa, pral gen yon eleman dokiman kote tout dokiman sa yo yo ap disponib nan piblik la pou ke lè yon moun mande, ki kote sa a?
 Nou ka rekòmande yon kote pou ou.
 Tout minit nan reyinyon nou yo pral ale la.
 Tout ajanda reyinyon nou yo pral la.
 Se konsa, nou te gen yon estrikti antye nan plas eseye ak fè sa.
 Nou pa pare ankò, men mwen espere nan pwochen reyinyon an nou ka pran yon toune nan fowòm nou an.
 sit entènèt sa a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6731.704s">[Preisner]</a>: Ok
 Oke, ale pi devan, sa a pral pòtay la deyò an.
 Kouman sou entèfas nou an?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6738.866s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Se konsa, li nan yon kesyon difisil paske gen nan reyèlman pa gen fen nan je pou nou anba lwa yo reyinyon louvri.
 Yon fwa yo lage yon orè, tout dokiman li yo ap vin yon pati nan dosye piblik la.
 Si nou fè sa, bagay la difisil se, si nou ap travay dèyè sèn yo, gen nan yon bon chans nou ap vyole lwa reyinyon louvri.
 Se poutèt sa, administratè yo gen yon kopi k ap travay nan dokiman an yo ap travay sou epi yo pa reprezante yon kowòm epi yo ka kontinye fè sa.
 Yon fwa dokiman yo rive isit la, yo pral mete yo sou yon kondwi piblikman ki disponib.
 Lè nou pale sou koreksyon dokiman, pa gen okenn koreksyon offline sou tablo sa a.
 Reyinyon piblik yo pa pèmèt lalwa.
 Malerezman, nou ap chita isit la koreksyon yon dokiman yo ansanm.
 Sa a se vrèman youn nan pati ki pi douloure nan jere pwosesis sa a ke ou tout siyen pou.
 Padon.
 Men, wi, li trè douloure, men offline, ki kalite koreksyon offline ki travay byen nenpòt lòt kote nan mond lan, se pa yon opsyon isit la.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6811.109s">[Preisner]</a>: Oke, pa pwal gen okenn Google Drive oswa dokiman pataje, tout bagay yo pral pibliye.
 Yo pral parèt sou sit entènèt la lè yo pibliye.
 Lè yo parèt sou sit entènèt la, yo se esansyèlman konfigirasyon kontwòl epi yo pa ka chanje san yo pa ranvèse chanjman sa yo isit la.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6826.757s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Kòrèk.
 Wi.
 Sa a se absoliman terib.
 Nou jwenn fason pou fè yo mwens pè, men malerezman, yo te mwens pè.
 Sa a se asire w ke ou jwenn kominote a nan pwoblèm an tèm de ki jan dokiman an modifye.
 Lè sa a, pral gen, lè nou fè sa, mwen pral jwenn ke reyinyon sa yo yo pi efikas sou rale.
 Ou ka chita kote ou vle, tout moun ka wè dokiman an ke yo te modifye, ak gen nan okenn fason yo konnen li te ke yo te modifye si li pa fè piblikman.
 Se konsa, nou dwe trè pridan nan sa a konsiderasyon.
 Men, repons lan se wi, li nan yon pwosesis.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6903.643s">[Parkinson]</a>: Totalman mal politik, 40 manm.
 Yon manm te di, Simon, tanpri asire w ke ou nan do a epi ekri kòmantè nou yo epi mete yo ansanm.
 Repons lan se non.
 Se konsa, ou ekri kòmantè ou ak reponn pou yo di, oke, admèt li.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6926.232s">[Suzanne Galusi]</a>: eseye.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6926.472s">[Parkinson]</a>: Se jis sa nou santi nou.
 Nou tout te dakò sa a te pwobableman youn nan pi gwo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6933.462s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Wi.
 Mèsi ankò pou yo te isit la.
 Mwen tou ki enterese nan pati nan kominikasyon ak pandan y ap travay la se gwo, mwen toujou kontan pran yon apèl kèk.
 Yo pral tounen isit la.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6948.428s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Tout dènye sa yo ap tounen isit la.
 Èske gen nenpòt lòt kesyon ou ka reponn sou soukomite a oswa sou ajanda a?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6958.671s">[King]</a>: Mwen gen yon kesyon.
 Mwen gen yon kesyon sou vote.
 Wi, lè nou vote.
 Wi, nou pa.
 Ki sa mwen pa janm konprann te pèmèt proxies.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6972.628s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Non.
 Non, li pa.
 Èske otorite pèmèt nan reyinyon yo?
 Non, ou pa ka bay vòt ou a yon lòt moun.
 Lè nou fèmen, nou pral vote paske nou dwe vote pou fèmen.
 Tipikman, sa rive nan sa yo rele yon vòt vwa, kote tout moun di "wi" epi nou mache ale.
 Ann pratike woule paske li
 Ankò, gòch ak alèz.
 Se konsa, nou pral vlope li pa fè sa.
 Men, nenpòt ki lòt kesyon anvan nou vlope moute?
 Mwen peye atansyon.
 Men, mwen panse ke yon lòt bagay ki vo dekri se ke gen afè yon kèk manm ki pa vote sou komite sa a.
 Rezon ki fè la pou sa a se pa paske nou pa vle tande pale de ou.
 Ou isit la paske nou vle tande pale de ou.
 Lè nou vote, yo pa pral rele non ou epi ou pa pral vote.
 Men, pi lwen pase sa, ou se yon manm konplè nan komite sa a.
 Yo te avèti mwen
 Lè gen anpil manm pou vote, fè biznis vin trè difisil kòm yon kowòm nan komite a oblije satisfè ak fè biznis.
 Li tout vin trè, trè konplike.
 Se konsa, sa nou ap eseye di se: nou vle gen yon gwo komite, men nou bezwen tou pou kapab avanse pou pi devan avèk efikasite ak efektivman ak sou sa.
 Sa a se rezon ki dèyè li.
 Kisa nou te fè la.
 Mwen panse ke gwosè a nan Komisyon an pral sètènman chanje sou tout lavi li yo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7068.989s">[King]</a>: Se konsa, 25?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7070.309s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Wi, gen 15 manm vòt nan komite a, ki se toujou yon nimewo trè bon nan manm vòt yo.
 Nou pral pratike vote byento.
 Men, nenpòt ki lòt kesyon pou pwochen reyinyon an?
 Règ, règleman ak entegrasyon yo ap fèt nan 7 me, yo pral angajman kominote a ap fèt sou Me 8 ak gwoup la pral pote tounen ak rezilta yo sou 13 me.
 Se konsa, an jeneral, a vas majorite nan reyinyon nou an sou 13 Me pral sou diskite sou rekòmandasyon sa yo ak dakò sou plan sa yo.
 Nou se nan mòd demaraj ankò.
 Apre sa, nou pral pran yon gade pi pre nan kèk nan dokiman yo gouvènman an ki te ap travay sou, ak Lè sa a, nou pral kòmanse
 Li dokiman sa yo an plen, pale sou sa ki nan yo ak bagay sa yo tankou sa.
 Men, kite a fè l 'byen vit.
 Li se jis yon ti rezon ki fè nou gen yon ajanda reyinyon yo.
 Nou pral rankontre nan Bishop 489 nenpòt lè li posib
 Depi koulye a jouk nan fen mwa jen.
 Mwen pwomèt nou pral tounen nan Lendi nwit nan kòmansman ane pwochen lekòl la.
 Men, kenbe orè sa a ant kounye a ak nan fen mwa jen, ant reyinyon komite lekòl la ak jou ferye yo, se tou senpleman enposib.
 Nou pral sèlman rankontre atravè Zoom pandan ete a, epi nou te aktyèlman te deplase reyinyon nou yo mèkredi, konsidere lendi ak vandredi yo se reyèlman difisil jwenn yon fowòm pou nenpòt moun ki fè anyen nan sezon lete an.
 Èspere ke nou ka jwenn sa a fè, men mwen eseye kenbe limyè a reyinyon limyè.
 Mwen panse ke pral gen plis sou -komite nan fen mwa Out la, men sa a se jis nan konmansman an nan moun ki ap eseye òganize lavi okipe yo.
 Wi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7178.606s">[Parkinson]</a>: Sepandan, sa a se yon kesyon endirèk.
 Si ou pa kapab.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7183.63s">[Joan Bowen]</a>: Tout se byen.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7184.27s">[Parkinson]</a>: Tanpri tou fè nou konnen tout panse ou ak kòmantè via imel.
 Mesye Prezidan, vwa ou ale.
 Lè sa a,</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7205.75s">[Preisner]</a>: Aktyèlman sa a se yon pwoblèm teknik.
 Pou anpeche yon mesye ale nan yon reyinyon, ou voye l 'yon imèl ki montre lide ou ak sijesyon, petèt menm yon desizyon.
 Nou te tande anvan ke imèl se yon move lide pou prèske tout bagay eksepte mete yon ajanda.
 Sa a son tankou yon zòn gri.
 Mwen panse, kidonk ou konnen lwa reyinyon ouvè a, ak de bagay sa yo nan konfli.
 Ki jan li travay?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7232.16s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Se konsa, mwen ka di ou, mwen panse ke nenpòt ki avoka ta di ou pa janm mete anyen alekri, dwa?
 Sa a se kote nou kòmanse.
 Pa janm mete anyen alekri.
 Sa vle di, si ou pral ekri yon bagay desann, nan ka sa a, repons lan se wi, li nan yon zòn gri.
 Kisa ou ta dwe fè se kontakte yon moun epi di, hey, mwen ka voye ba ou kòmantè mwen an?
 Eske ou te pale de bagay sa yo ak nenpòt lòt moun oswa ou fè plan?
 Ou ka rezonab asire w ke ou gen yon bouk fèmen, dwa?
 Sa a se sa ou te di m ', mwen ka voye ba ou opinyon mwen an?
 Mwen te di wi.
 Mwen te di, mwen pa pale sou pwoblèm sa yo ak nenpòt lòt moun, se konsa nou ap amann.
 Sa a sèlman vin yon pwoblèm si ou konekte ak kèk nan moun ki reprezante majorite nan komite a.
 Pou egzanp, si ou di: Mwen vle di de moun paske mwen pa fin sèten ki moun ki pral nan reyinyon an, ki nan oke paske ou pa uit ankò.
 Apre pale ak tèt ou, ki gen ladan uit moun, w ap nan pwoblèm.
 Nan pwen sa a ou ap vyole Lwa sou Reyinyon Open.
 Pati a difisil se ke tout moun ki enplike gen gen menm konpreyansyon a kòm moun ki patisipe nan konvèsasyon sa a.
 Kisa mwen manke?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7312.233s">[Parkinson]</a>: Ou ka trè entansyonèl.
 Mwen jis di ou, jis ale, haha.
 Lè sa a, ou fè menm bagay la.
 Kèlkeswa sa nou fè pou obeyi lwa a, nou kraze lwa a.
 Se konsa, mwen te panse li ta enteresan yo trase yon liy.
 Li sanble ke bavardaj seri pa pran swen sou anyen.
 Sa a pa gen anyen fè ak kontni, plan oswa asirans.
 Se jis de nan nou, dwa?
 Wi.
 Ou ale epi vyole li.
 Mwen te kraze lwa a.
 Menm si mwen pa konnen.
 Oke.
 Oke, wi, sa bon.
 Eske nou dwe deside?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7350.203s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Nou pral bay chak moun ki gen yon Medford Adrès Imèl Lekòl Piblik.
 Mwen rekòmande ke ou pa sèvi ak imèl pèsonèl ou pou nenpòt ki biznis MSBA ki gen rapò nan okenn sikonstans.
 Yon fwa sa yo Imèl yo mete kanpe, nou pral konvèti tout bagay.
 Men, mwen fòtman konseye w pa sèvi ak imèl pèsonèl ou pou nenpòt ki rezon.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7369.017s">[Parkinson]</a>: Sa fè konfòmite dosye piblik menm plis redoutable.
 Mwen se Ofisye Aksè Dosye pou Distri Lekòl la.
 Ak eksepsyon nan nòt pèsonèl ou, tout dokiman ki te pwodwi pa lekòl biznis ofisyèl yo se dosye piblik epi yo ta dwe disponib otomatikman oswa omwen revize sou demann.
 Se konsa, gen tout nan sa ki nan Medford Lekòl Piblik adrès imèl la, Medford Lekòl Piblik Google pake a kote ou ka pran nòt ak bagay sa yo tankou sa, li vrèman itil yo gen tout bagay ki nan espas sa a.
 Nenpòt kesyon final?
 Li nan 8.03 kounye a.
 Nou jis espere règleman Robert a mete konferans sa a sou kenbe.
 Èske gen yon mosyon pou ajoune?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7429.79s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Manm Orapade te fè yon mosyon pou fèmen, epi manm Russo te apiye li.
 Mèsi.

 Èske li peye?</p>
