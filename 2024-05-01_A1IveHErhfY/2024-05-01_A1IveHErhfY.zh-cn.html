 谢谢。
 欢迎，大家。
 我们在这里。
 我们做到了。
 这真的很令人兴奋。
 谢谢大家的到来。
 就通过今晚的一些计划，我们将在8点离开。
 我们要早日离开。
 第一件事，我将把议程转移到一点点，因为来自KP Law的Janelle在这里进行了一些公开的会议法律培训。
 因此，我们目前将跳过介绍。
 因此，珍妮尔（Janelle）可以在训练时进行公开会议，因为她对本次会议的下半场有承诺。
 因此，我想确保有足够的时间让她进入。
 但是在我们这样做之前，我只是要进行一个快速通话，以便我们在记录中知道谁在这里。
 珍妮·格雷厄姆（Jenny Graham）在这里。
 Lungo-Koehn市长。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=263.276s">[Galusi]</a>: 这里。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=264.056s">[Graham]</a>: 爱德华·本森博士。
 这里。
 博士进入条目。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=267.077s">[Galusi]</a>: 这里。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=268.037s">[Graham]</a>: 库欣博士。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=268.997s">[Galusi]</a>: 这里。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=269.257s">[Graham]</a>: 主持人Cabral。
 这里。
 布朗夫人。
 这里。
 玛丽莎·戴斯蒙德（Marissa Desmond），玛丽亚·多尔西（Maria Dorsey），布莱恩·希利亚德（Brian Hilliard），他缺席。
 特雷西·基恩（Tracy Keene），艾米丽·拉扎罗（Emily Lazzaro）缺席。
 她今晚举行了理事会会议。
 妮可·莫雷尔（Nicole Morell）缺席。
 她以前有冲突。
 亚伦·洛帕特（Aaron Lopate），卢克·普雷斯纳（Luke Preissner），拉里·布朗（Larry Brown），鲍勃·迪金森（Bob Dickinson），他今天晚上不在这里。
 菲奥娜·麦克斯韦（Fiona Maxwell），琼·鲍恩（Joan Bowen），
 我相信，乍得·法伦（Chad Fallon）的托马斯·道尔顿（Thomas Dalton）即将来临。
 Lori Hodgkin，John McLaughlin，Paul Rousseau和Philip Santos今晚不在。
 他也举行了会议。
 所以我们有一个法定人数。
 您将了解为什么在短短几分钟内就很重要。
 但是我要在短短一秒钟内将其交给Janelle。
 但是我想首先要说我们所有的会议都遵守公开会议法。
 在公开会议上有四年的经验，这是完成工作的一种非常笨拙的方式。
 所以我只是要说这是我的个人经历。
 它是有原因的。
 这是绝对必要的，但是这将要求大家不仅要仔细考虑您在会议上说什么和做的事情，而且更重要的是，您在会议之外的表现，因为
 您可以无意间发现自己与公开会议法冲突。
 MSB要求我们按照公开会议法举行所有会议，因此我们认为对于每个人来说，在所有这些方面都有某种基础很重要。
 嗯，房间中的民选官员显然熟悉公开会议法，并可以为有疑问的任何人提供指导。
 我只是为此签了他们。
 嗯，我会像您一样对房间的教育工作者说，通常一直与学校委员会互动，您通常不受公开会议法律的约束，而是在这个房间和这个话题上。
 所以这只是一个调整
 您以这种方式承担一套责任。
 所以我要把它移交给珍妮尔。
 珍妮尔（Janelle），如果您可以让我们知道您是否想要一路上的问题，还是希望我们在完成之前持有问题。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=405.964s">[Austin]</a>:  Sure.
 Thank you so much.
 Can everyone hear me okay?
 Yes.
 Thank you so much for having me this evening.
 Happy to present on this very important topic of the open meeting law.
 I will dive into the public records law a little bit to the extent there's a little bit of overlap.
 I always think it's a good idea to cover these topics.
 Certainly I agree in terms of open meeting law compliance.
 I represent the city of Medford, other communities across the state, and we are seeing a significant uptick in open meeting law compliance.
 So certainly a good opportunity to provide best practices, talk a little bit in terms of
 you know, what your role is in terms of open meeting law compliance, and I understand that some members may be more familiar than others, so I'll try to start with best practices, and I think that's always a good idea.
 If there are certainly any questions after the training,
 or along the way, I think we can feel free to interject.
 I'm an informal person, as many of you know, happy to have this be a conversation.
 If someone feels more comfortable speaking to me after the training, I'm certainly happy to make myself available as well.
 And the mayor has my contact information, happy to provide that.
 I would also start by saying certification is really important.
 So for any member that hasn't already completed their open meeting law certification, I recommend that be done as soon as possible.
 The new Attorney General has put forth a new updated open meeting law guide.
 last year.
 That's available on the Division of Open Government's website.
 I'm happy to circulate the link after this, but in my opinion, if any members are due for their open meeting law certification or for any new members, it's a good idea and certainly required under the open meeting law that that be conducted.
 We are going to cover best practices tonight where this is a public meeting.
 I don't want to go into any specifics or anything that may invoke the open meeting law in a non-confidential way.
 Certainly if there are any questions, happy to follow up afterwards.
 I think I have the ability to share my screen.
 So I wanted to go through the slides that I have.
 And again, if anyone has any particular questions, happy to either interject.
 I won't take offense or go from there.
 Can everyone see the slides okay?
 Great.
 So we're here tonight to talk about the open meeting law.
 I'm gonna talk about best practices.
 I'm gonna go through the sort of fundamentals of the open meeting law.
 We certainly start with the premise that the open meeting law, public records and conflict of interest law throughout the country are really, you know, aimed at government transparency and to eliminate secrecy in terms of the work.
 that you all are doing.
 So we know that under the open meeting law, public bodies such as yourself that are subject to the open meeting law can generally only conduct public business through their public meetings, unless there's a specific exemption applies called an executive session, which would allow you to have a confidential meeting.
 And we'll cover that a little bit further in the training.
 But in essence, the open meeting law regulates the process by which public meetings can be held and conducted.
 And there are really several components to what the open meeting law requires.
 So one, what types of meetings are subject to the law?
 What rules need to be followed to hold a meeting sufficient to give members of the public notice?
 And what are the common violations and why?
 And I think this is always a good idea to cover, again, not to scare anyone or detract from any of the important work that you all are doing, but really just so we're all aware of what the Attorney General's Division of Open Government requires in terms of enforcement, and really to make sure everyone's on the same page with respect to the work and business of the committee.
 The open meeting law addresses four major issues, so I want to cover those in detail.
 And apologies if this is, you know, some information that many of the members may have, but I think it's always a good idea to do a refresher.
 We know that the open meeting law requires notice.
 Essentially, it requires that postings be conducted no more than 48 weekday hours prior to the meeting.
 We know that the
 notice has to be posted in a location accessible 24 hours a day, including the website, and the meeting has to be held in an accessible location under the ADA.
 If you are meeting virtually or in a hybrid format, we can talk about that.
 Certainly, information should be available so members of the public know how to log in at home, and any location that you're meeting in person should be accessible as well.
 We also know that the meeting notice or the agenda should have detailed subject matter items, so we'll talk a little bit about what that means.
 But it's a detailed list of topics that you will all review so that a member of the public can look at that meeting notice at home and say, yes, I'd like to attend the meeting because I know these topics are going to be covered, or no, I'm going to pass on this one and go to the next one.
 someone should be able to say, I understand what this meeting is about and I want to attend this meeting based on what's on the meeting notice.
 We're going to talk a little bit about the nature of the meeting.
 As I mentioned at the beginning, there's a presumption under the open meeting law because of government transparency issues for an open session.
 So the meetings conducted as we're meeting tonight in an open session so members of the public can see in real time
 what the public body is doing, the votes that are being conducted and the deliberation, and we'll talk about what that means, of the body's business and the public business being conducted.
 There are certain pretty narrowly tailored reasons for a closed or an executive session, and we'll talk about the procedures if you do end up meeting in executive session.
 Conduct of the meeting, this is a hot,
 hot topic in recent years, essentially, you know, what rules govern public comment?
 What are the free speech principles that may apply?
 Who gets to speak and when in remote and hybrid meetings?
 So we'll cover that.
 And then the fourth major component of the open meeting law is the meeting minutes themselves.
 Essentially the content of the meeting, detailed enough, similar to a meeting notice to allow someone that wasn't present
 to know what transpired or what took place at the meeting.
 The timing for drafting and approving those meeting minutes, essentially for an open meeting within three meetings or 30 days, whichever is later, is a standard that the Attorney General's Division of Open Government established.
 And we'll talk about the process to do that.
 Most of the public bodies that I work with
 usually have them approved at a, you know, an open meeting of the public body for any meeting minutes, but some decide to designate that task to the chair or to another individual.
 That's a policy decision, but we can talk about that if anyone has any questions on that as well.
 So we'll go through the overview essentially.
 48 hours, I can't tell you how important that is prior to the date of the meeting.
 So certainly to be cognizant of
 legal holidays, vacation schedules, certainly as the summer months come up and there's various holidays in play, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, as well as July 4th, something to be aware of as you schedule meetings that it's 48 weekday hours, not including holidays or weekends.
 The meeting notice should list all the topics with specificity.
 And regardless of whether the meeting was posted correctly,
 We know that the open meeting law says that a meeting occurs whenever a quorum of your public body discusses matters within its jurisdiction.
 So we're gonna spend a lot of time on email practices and text message practices, because I certainly agree with the statement at the beginning of the meeting, that in essence, it's just as important what occurs outside of a public body's meeting under the open meeting law as to what occurs during a meeting.
 So we're gonna talk about pitfalls and some things to be careful of relative to your work.
 And essentially something that I see all the time and to be careful about is that we know that a quorum can be reached regardless of whether an email goes to the entire public body or whether it goes to several members and then it's forwarded to other members.
 So we're gonna talk about that.
 We call that serial communications and it's something with the,
 you know, explosion and all of us use technology all the time.
 It's something to be aware of, certainly, as you serve relative to the open meeting law to not get into a situation where there's deliberation over email or text message or other social media mechanisms.
 Subcommittees, I don't know if you intend to create any subcommittees, but certainly wanting to review that as well as we provide an overview.
 A subcommittee is also subject to the open meeting law.
 The intent to create a subcommittee essentially is not required, and the attorney general will look to determine whether or not the subcommittee is within government, empowered to act collectively in serving a public purpose.
 So generally speaking, unless there's an exception, and we'll talk about that, a subcommittee of your committee is essentially subject to the open meeting law.
 just as the entire compliment would be.
 You know, there are exceptions to that.
 If the mayor created a subcommittee to advise just herself or the superintendent did, where they are not individually subject to the open meeting law, a subcommittee created by them wouldn't be.
 It's a very fact specific analysis.
 So we just wanna be really careful with respect to the creation of subcommittees or working groups or task forces.
 to determine whether or not they are subject to the open meeting law.
 Some practical ways, I try to be practical as many of you know, to avoid violations of the open meeting law.
 One person reporting back to the public body doesn't create a subcommittee.
 And if multiple members are using, doing work on behalf of the public body, you would wanna post a meeting and comply with the open meeting law.
 Any questions so far?
 Okay, I'll continue on.
 Some tips to stay out of trouble.
 And this is all things that I've seen in advising municipalities since 2006 on open meeting law and public records issues.
 So it certainly comes from experience.
 If you are attending a meeting of another public body, school committees, city council,
 the city of Medford.
 Um another.
 I'm sure you're all very involved in the city of Medford and the work that the city does.
 You want to avoid creating the appearance, whether that be at another public bodies meeting or social event or community event.
 Um that you are discussing matters within this public bodies jurisdiction.
 Um I've handled open meeting law complaints or issues over the years where there's an
 or there was a community event and I think that they were talking about X, Y and Z. So certainly you wanna avoid the appearance that you are discussing municipal business.
 To the extent you need to meet jointly with the city council or the school committee or another public body, you can post a joint meeting to be held at the same time and place and then minutes would be prepared just as they would for any other meeting that you may have.
 If you're doing a site visit, certainly,
 best practice may be to send a representative to report back, and then that content is included in the next session's meeting minutes.
 You don't want to be in a position where there's a site visit at a particular location, for instance, that is not accessible.
 And then we're going to spend a lot of time tonight on email, but I can't reiterate this enough to try to avoid the use of email or text messages or social media.
 amongst a quorum of your public body.
 Locations, you're gonna wanna file your meeting notice with the city clerk and they're online as well.
 Some best practices with respect to using your or posting your meeting notice.
 I would recommend not using acronyms or abbreviations.
 Really someone that just moved to the city of Medford should be able to pick it up and say,
 I understand what's going on at this meeting.
 We all that do work with public bodies and public entities understand terms like MSBCA or MSBA, DEP, you know, DEF DESI, but certainly, you know, for the first time, you may want to spell it out just so everyone knows what is being discussed.
 The meeting notice should indicate the date and time of the posting.
 And if you do revise it, I don't know what the practice is going to be.
 You're going to want to include both the date that it was originally drafted and then the revised date as well.
 And that should be done 48 hours, 48 business hours in advance.
 Regularly occurring items do need some more detail than just these examples that I've used.
 What we know from recent determinations from the Division of Open Government is that more detail is better than less detail, so we don't really want to use categories such as new business, old business, or departmental report.
 We really want to specify, for instance, correspondence and list if there's any notable correspondence or
 you know, budget analysis and list any particular reports, for instance, that are going to be done.
 So I would recommend erring on the side of more, not less specificity, which should be helpful to alert members of the public about the exact topics that are going to be discussed.
 Any questions on any of this?
 Great.
 Some practical considerations, and this does come up obviously from time to time, scheduling matters or space limitations.
 Generally, a meeting may not be continued from one night to the next as a matter of course, unless that continuation is posted under the open meeting law.
 So if you couldn't meet tonight, would have to reschedule this meeting and repost it for the new date and time.
 And the notice requirement under the open meeting law doesn't substitute or supersede any other notice requirements if you have them under any other legal requirements.
 So always worth double checking to make sure you're covering any publication notice or anything else that may be required.
 Emergencies.
 I can't tell you how many questions I get regarding emergencies, particularly in the winter months with inclement weather.
 There are very limited instances when a public body can meet without that 48 hours notice that's required.
 Poor planning doesn't equal an emergency.
 We know from determinations of the Attorney General's office.
 So if there was just a mishap with respect to scheduling, and I certainly understand everyone's doing the best they can, and you certainly have a lot of schedules to figure out,
 with respect to the public body's business, but generally an emergency is limited to natural disasters, public health matters, and public safety issues.
 So something to be aware of.
 We can talk a little bit about if something's unanticipated, that's a little bit different, but hosting is really limited in the emergency context.
 If you do have an emergency you really need to meet,
 There's a specific reason why the 48 hours couldn't have been, it couldn't have been posted with the 48 hours.
 You do want to comply with the open meeting law to the extent you can, and really limit deliberations to just that emergency matter.
 You're gonna take meeting minutes of that emergency meeting, and then you'd wanna post a follow-up meeting where you basically ratify the action that was taken at the emergency.
 So let's hope for no emergencies.
 but just wanted to make sure everyone had that information as well.
 Conducting meetings.
 So we're gonna move a little bit from the notice piece of this and the agenda piece of the open meeting law to now how those meetings are conducted.
 These are topics that I often receive a lot of questions about.
 So I just wanted to make sure everyone had the best practices related to these particular topics of the open meeting law.
 We know that
 If the meeting is being recorded, similar to whether it be on Zoom or in person, that there should be a public statement or notification to the public through the technological means that the meeting minute is going to be recorded.
 And the basis of that is the Massachusetts wiretap statute.
 We can't secretly record anyone in Massachusetts.
 If an individual wants to record the meeting on their own, it's not otherwise recorded.
 So if someone shows up to an in-person meeting, it used to be when I started doing this, it would be the big, you know, the big recording device with a tripod that we had the old VCR tapes for.
 Now, of course, it's iPhones.
 The individual must inform the chair of their intent to do the recording.
 And then the chair would make the required announcement to the public body
 members as well as members of the public indicating that the meeting was going to be recorded.
 In my opinion, the chair can decide to reasonably regulate the recording placement.
 Obviously, as technology is smaller and smaller, this is less of an issue, but we don't want to block anyone's view, so to speak.
 And people can be in a position where they're not interrupting or there's no disorderly conduct in the meeting themselves.
 Any questions on recordings?
 Nope.
 Okay, thank you.
 Email.
 I would say, I'm going to try to do the math here.
 70 to 80% of the open meeting law complaints that I deal with relate to the use of email, text messages, or other social media mechanisms.
 So I say that again, we all use technology, it's efficient, it's quick,
 It garners a quick response and certainly, I'm sure you all use it, you know, in your other lives, professional lives, personal lives.
 But really, the open meeting law does not encourage the use of email or other text messages by members of the public body to conduct their business.
 Email is explicitly addressed in the open meeting law, and it is often the reason I see for a violation to be determined by the Attorney General's office.
 And what the law requires is that a quorum, either collectively, so reply all situation, or, you know, a group of individuals or one individual forwards it to another who forwards another, can constitute an open meeting law violation.
 Members should really be cautious and a best practice would be not to use email to share ideas, beliefs, opinions, concerns, whether serially or in a single email regarding business.
 And you can't use another member to, you can't send an email to a non-public body member to then circulate out to the group as well.
 Some practical approaches, certainly beware to reply all on emails and really limit
 the use of email to scheduling purposes only and try to avoid using it to undertake business.
 We should always assume that emails could be forwarded to, you know, a local blogger, put on Facebook, sent to the newspaper.
 I've seen it before.
 So we really want to be very considerate of the use of email.
 And this is where there is the overlap with the public records law
 because even if you're volunteers, emails or text messages or social media posts that are made in your official capacity or in relation to your service on this committee really are subject to the public records law as well.
 And so if you use a Gmail account or a personal cell phone to send an email or a text message, and there is a public records request for that,
 that certainly would be subject to the public records law, most likely.
 So just something to be very cognizant of as you begin your service.
 Is there a question?
 No, I think we're good.
 Okay, great.
 Thank you.
 Texting and social media, texting and social media, similar, also subject to the open meeting law.
 Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, Reddit, all of those are subject to the public records law and the open meeting law to the extent there is deliberation.
 If you are a user of social media, certainly in your individual capacity, you have free speech and first amendment considerations.
 So I'm not gonna speak directly to your individual rights, but certainly some practical approaches if you are posting on your service, you don't wanna direct comments to your other members,
 And if a matter directly involves issues pending, you might wanna consider not engaging.
 Certainly again, be thoughtful about the comments that are made and consider using separate accounts if you do run for something.
 Remember that applicants or any individual before you has due process rights.
 So certainly something to be cognizant of as well.
 The open meeting law,
 does not mandate, we're gonna talk a little bit about the authority of the chair in public comment, does not mandate that any particular person be allowed to speak at a meeting.
 So that's something we've seen a particular uptick in, both with respect to First Amendment auditors across the state, and also I'll talk a little bit about a case that came out last year that is really important.
 The open meeting law doesn't require that you even allow public participation or public comment, though I certainly understand that most public bodies do.
 The open meeting law indicates that the chair essentially has the sole discretion as to who may speak and for how long.
 So comments are directed through the chair, as you know.
 And while public comment isn't required under the open meeting law,
 allowing the public to speak during your meeting or restricting any speech, other than based on time, place, and manner restrictions, and we'll talk about what that means, does have serious constitutional implications.
 So certainly if you do allow public comment,
 all of the decisions as to who's going to speak or for how long should be content neutral.
 So not based on the particular message for a speaker or what that individual says, but just based on the time that's allotted.
 Some public bodies I work with say 15 minutes of public comment, everyone gets two or three minutes, people are allowed to speak once or twice depending on how busy the agenda is.
 And some have adopted public comment policies as well.
 So certainly something to put out there to all of you to consider.
 And we'll talk a little bit more about public comment, but the chair does have the authority to regulate it subject to those constitutional restrictions.
 Public participation, whether or not to allow public participation is a significant policy decision.
 here are a couple of factors for all of you to consider.
 When will the public participation period occur?
 Is it going to be at the beginning of the meeting?
 Is it going to be in the middle of the meeting or at the end of the meeting?
 How long will it be?
 You know, like I said, 10, 15 minutes is usually what I see, but there are some meetings where warrants particular input from members of the public.
 And so you all may decide a half an hour or an hour
 We just want to make sure it's equal across the board for anyone that wants to speak.
 How long will each person be allowed to speak and whether or not each person can speak more than once.
 So conducting the meeting, policy issues for public comment periods, any rules about public participation must relate to the process.
 such participation and cannot relate to any speech protected by constitutional principles.
 Any restrictions on an individual's speech must be narrowly tailored.
 So again, try to give some practical advice here, items to consider.
 During a public comment period, you certainly want to avoid a debate to the extent you can.
 You want to avoid responding before you've had the time or opportunity to discuss it or if the matter is controversial.
 And it is perfectly fine, both under the open meeting law, as well as under constitutional considerations, to just leave matters raised during public comment unresolved.
 They're not on the meeting agenda itself.
 And so it may be something that you decide to put on a
 a future meeting agenda so that members, the public that may be interested in the topic can come to the next meeting and say, okay, this is going to be reviewed.
 We're going to have an open discussion.
 We're going to be able to deliberate on it.
 So some practical items to consider there.
 Matters not reasonably anticipated by the chair that are going to be discussed by all of you must be added to the agenda.
 after the posting deadline to the extent feasible.
 And I'll give an example of that.
 If you are going to designate a staff member or someone else to work on your agenda, you wanna make sure that that person understands that it has to be added as soon as possible.
 And like we had talked about at the beginning with respect to the meeting notice, the updated agenda should show the original date as well as the date that it was changed.
 Matters not reasonably anticipated by the chair may be discussed and acted upon, but the Attorney General's Office does recommend, unless it requires immediate attention, it really should be put off to a later meeting and included in that meeting posting.
 So it really is, was this matter so time-sensitive, but yet unanticipated that it had to be discussed at this meeting?
 We updated the meeting agenda,
 and we're going to essentially discuss it, or can we put it off to the next meeting because it isn't time sensitive and it really could have been anticipated based on the totality of the circumstances.
 Any questions on any of that?
 I know it's a lot of content.
 Anything from any of the members?
 Looks like we're good so far.
 Okay, thank you so much.
 Meeting minutes, I don't know if you've all determined how the meeting minutes will be prepared or created and approved, but wanted to make sure, and I'll make these slides available to anyone that wants them after the meeting.
 I'll certainly circulate them so you have them as well as some other materials that may be helpful as a little open meeting log guide.
 The date, time, and place of the meeting and members present and absent does need to be included.
 You know, I get this question all the time.
 Are the meeting minutes a transcript?
 And the answer is no.
 What we know is it doesn't need to be a verbatim transcript of what transpired, particularly as I would imagine you're going to have longer meetings from time to time.
 What the attorney general's office has said and what the open meeting law requires is that it has to have a detailed summary of the discussion of each topic so that a member of the public sitting at home that goes to the website and looks at meeting minutes once they're drafted and approved says, okay, I understand what happened at this meeting, right?
 I understand this was the topic discussed.
 This is the general nature of the discussion.
 These were the votes that were taken.
 Here are the next steps.
 It can't be very cursory, but at the same time, it doesn't need to be a verbatim transcript.
 We do know that it should have the decisions made, any actions taken, and any votes recorded.
 You all did proper roll call vote at the beginning.
 If you are meeting in a remote capacity, you do want to do a roll call vote, and we'll talk about that in a little bit as well.
 The meeting minutes should also reference any documents or other exhibits that you use or consider during a meeting.
 They don't need to be attached to the meeting minutes, but we just want to reference them so that if there is a public records request or a request for those meeting minutes and all materials that you use during the meeting, someone can go back and figure out what was discussed and put the package together to then send to a member of the public.
 Meeting minutes do need to be approved and drafted in a timely manner.
 We know that that requires under the current regulations that that approval has to transpire within the next three meetings or within 30 days, whichever is later.
 There are several determinations that talk about, you know, staffing constraints or operational constraints alone aren't really a good reason for a delay in those approval of the meeting minutes.
 Certainly things happen.
 Everyone's busy and people are doing the best they can.
 My general advice and best practice is to try to stay on top of the drafting and approval of the meeting minutes as best as you can, given your other responsibilities.
 A question has come up very frequently in the last couple of years, can a public body use Google Docs or another document sharing mechanism to edit
 edit the meeting minutes in advance of a meeting to make that a more efficient process.
 And generally that is not allowed under the Open Meeting Law because if several members are going into Google Docs and sharing their comments outside of a public meeting, that could constitute a deliberation.
 It can be delegated, this task, to one individual.
 It's a matter of policy in terms of how you want to handle it in terms of efficiency, but there are different methods, so if you have any questions on that, feel free to let me know, and I'm happy to walk through it.
 Meeting minutes are
 Minutes of open meetings are public records as of the moment of their creation, regardless of whether they've been approved.
 So draft meeting minutes are subject to the public records law, just as approved meeting minutes are.
 Certainly personal notes, so if you take personal notes that are not shared as part of the public body's official files or the school department's files or the city's files, those are personal to you.
 And I would argue those are exempt under the public records law.
 But the meeting minutes, even in draft form, would be subject to disclosure.
 And there is a slightly shorter timeframe for a request for meeting minutes under the open meeting law.
 It's 10 calendar days.
 For a public records request response, it's 10 business days.
 So I just wanted to make sure you had that information as well.
 Executive session minutes.
 I don't know how much you all will meet an executive session, but certainly wanted to make sure everyone was aware of what an executive session is and how those meeting minutes differ from open session meeting minutes.
 The open meeting law allows public bodies to meet an executive or confidential session
 for specific reasons, those are all spelled out in Chapter 30A, Section 21.
 And I have many handouts on this.
 If anyone wants it, feel free to let me know.
 Happy to share it with all of you.
 Basically, if you all meet in executive session, either for litigation or real estate reasons, or there's a particular complaint, those are the most common reasons to go into executive session.
 There are specific requirements that apply.
 There must be notice.
 There need to be roll call votes.
 And those meeting minutes as opposed to the open session meeting minutes are confidential so long as that executive session purpose applies or there may be another reason to keep them confidential even after they're released under the public records law.
 Essentially, executive session meeting minutes can be withheld until that purpose has been met
 unless they're protected under the public records law.
 And the most common example of that is if you were meeting regarding, you know, threatened litigation or litigation that you were involved in, I hope that never happens, under Purpose 3 of the open meeting law, and you had counsel advising you at that meeting, the litigation settles, the, you know, there's no threat of litigation, all of that goes away.
 but the meeting minutes themselves may be able to be redacted under the attorney client privilege.
 So there is a little bit of overlap there with respect to the open meeting law process and the public records process.
 So just want to make sure everyone knew that.
 If you do meet an executive session, the open meeting law requires the chair or the chair's designee to review executive session meeting minutes routinely.
 I usually recommend quarterly just to see, can the meeting minutes be released?
 Has the purpose expired or not?
 And so that, to get in the habit of doing that, if you do end up meeting in executive session, I think is very helpful as things progress.
 Same timeframe in terms of a response, the 10 calendar days as well.
 Not that you need to release them, but just that a response be provided.
 Any questions on that so far?
 Nope, we're good.
 Thank you.
 I just want to check in every once in a while just to make sure.
 Executive sessions, if you do meet an executive session, you're going to first convene an open session.
 This question comes up all the time.
 Well, we're just having an executive session, Janelle.
 Like, what do you mean?
 Well, you have an open session, you start, and then the public sees you vote to go into executive session.
 That's what the open meeting law requires.
 You're going to announce the purpose of the executive session without compromising the reason.
 You know, this comes up more often, I would say, for land use boards, for instance, but if you had, if there was a threat of litigation and you didn't want to impact that at all, certainly may decide as a matter of policy, we can't discuss this.
 So something to be aware of.
 You're going to take and record a roll call to vote to go into executive session.
 and announce publicly whether or not you're going to return an open session or reconvene at all.
 Exhibits and documents are going to, again, be stored in reasonable proximity to the minutes so that we understand what the record of the meeting, what happened at the meeting, what transpired, and really only, I can't stress this enough, discuss the matters that are cited.
 So if you do feel as if you have a reason to go into executive session to discuss things secretly,
 And again, they're very narrow for the reasons you can do this.
 You really only wanna discuss those matters.
 You don't want the conversation of we are in a different direction that should be discussed in open session because I have dealt with open meeting law complaints alleging that when the minutes are released, everyone can see there was an open discussion of something else.
 So really be cognizant that you're only talking about what you can talk about in executive session.
 And again, it's 38 section 21, and the open meeting raw guide that I can circulate after this meeting goes through all of that in detail and there's a very helpful checklist that I have as well that I'm happy to provide to the committee as they conduct as you all conduct your work.
 I do get this question quite often, so I wanted to make sure you all knew.
 If an executive session is anticipated, it does need to be listed in appropriate detail on the meeting notice, again, without compromising your position, and the vote to enter into executive session must also be listed as well.
 You know, it's often that
 You have an open meeting and someone will say, well, can we go into executive session now?
 And the answer is most likely not.
 The same posting requirements apply unless there's an emergency or unanticipated item.
 So I wanted to cover, before we go into questions, and I'm happy to answer any questions that anyone has, a little bit of the enforcement process, just so you're all aware of it in case this ever comes up, and I hope it doesn't.
 You know, step one is if there was an open meeting law complaint that a written complaint be filed, there's a specific form within 30 days that someone found out about the alleged violation.
 And then from there, the public body would review the complaint, discuss a response and issue a response to the complainant along with any action that was taken.
 The complainant can essentially be satisfied and not do anything else and say, I'm completely content.
 with how the committee responded, or alternatively, they can say, I want further review with the Attorney General's Office.
 And the Attorney General's Office has a specific division, the Division of Open Government, that is charged specifically with enforcement of the open meeting law.
 There's a director of that division and several attorneys, and they essentially review open meeting law complaints to determine whether or not a violation has occurred.
 There are a variety of options.
 If there is a violation that the AG's office has, they can nullify the action that's taken.
 There are fines that can be imposed for intentional violations.
 There is also the option to go to court to seek further relief if an individual wants to.
 And then three registered voters can also bring an action in superior court.
 You know, I think the bottom line here is to really take those best practices and try to employ them to the extent you can.
 And if there's any questions along the way, better to ask at the beginning than to let it go further than that.
 Any questions so far?
 Nope.
 Nope, I think we're good.
 Okay, thank you.
 So I wanted to cover some recent notable court decisions.
 I've given a long summary here just so everyone has them.
 I think really the takeaway is the Barron case is a huge case that was recently decided by the SJC, the Supreme Judicial Court, which is the highest state court in the Commonwealth.
 And that really dealt with public comment periods.
 And essentially, in summary, the court held that while
 Municipalities are not required to provide public comments during board and committee meetings.
 If you are required to do so, they have to comply with the provisions of the constitution.
 So after this decision in South Borough, and I encourage you to all read it if you're interested, and I have a copy if anyone wants it, in my opinion, care should really be taken that any public comment period, like we talked about a couple of slides back,
 is limited to these reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions, rather than mandating quote-unquote civility or other content-based restrictions.
 You know, certainly this was a trend since the court reviewed this Corey Spaulding case versus Town of Natick School Committee back in 2018.
 closely tracked that case and the ACLU was involved in that litigation.
 That also dealt with public comments during public meetings where there were allegations the committee improperly limited comments made by members of the public, which were critical of the committee, but allowed other individuals to speak.
 If we look at these cases together, essentially, I think it makes sense to have a public comment policy or consistency across the board with respect to time,
 but regulation of content is really problematic in light of these decisions.
 So if there are specific questions of that, as you begin to conduct your business, certainly let me know.
 I'm happy to analyze that.
 I've worked on a lot of public comment policies since the Barron decision was decided.
 So happy to answer any questions that anyone has on that.
 I think practically speaking, most people do the time restrictions
 for public comment period and decide where in the meeting they're going to have public comment based on their other businesses, business for that meeting.
 I've included reference to two other cases.
 The Town of Swansea case was about sufficiency of meeting minutes.
 So I wanted to make sure you all had that as well.
 And then the Bolter versus Whelan case was really, and I don't know how much this would impact your work, but really dealt with employee evaluation processes.
 The current state of the open meeting law.
 So we know that the COVID-19 pandemic era changes are in place until March 31st, 2025.
 They were extended by Governor Healey in a supplemental budget bill that further extended those temporary measures.
 They were put in place in 2020 and extended several times.
 I just wanted to alert all of you that there is also significant pending legislation that would either seek to extend this further or make modifications to the open meeting law.
 I haven't heard it moving quickly at the state level, but certainly will keep
 All of you updated along the way, if there are changes, we would update, certainly update you, but for now, you can meet entirely in person, you can meet entirely remotely, or you can meet in a hybrid format.
 You know, I think instead of holding meetings in a public place, you can provide adequate alternative means, and we'll talk about what that means.
 Public body members can also participate in meetings remotely as well.
 The changes are still optional,
 There are technological considerations, we'll talk about that, but essentially the 2020 changes that were in place remain in effect through at least March 31st, 2025.
 And I would imagine there'll be further action on those in the next six months.
 Adequate alternative access, what does that mean?
 It means that if you are providing, if you are meeting remotely,
 you have to provide real-time access.
 A lag of about 20 seconds or so is deemed acceptable, but if there is a technical problem that prevents the meeting from being accessible, the stream crashes, the meeting should be paused or rescheduled depending on the severity of the technical issue.
 So there have been multiple determinations that
 The attorney general's office has held that continuing a meeting and posting a recording afterwards does not cure a violation if the meeting is fully remote.
 The public must be able to access the meeting as it happens.
 And again, this is if there's a remote meeting.
 If you're meeting entirely in person and you're providing a courtesy link or it's being live streamed as this is on,
 know Medford community then that requirement would not apply in my opinion.
 Zoom as we're here tonight is the typical means but it's not required.
 Any method that allows the public to follow in real time is acceptable in light of the remote meeting requirements.
 Additional considerations if you are meeting remotely
 you have to make a public statement that the meeting is being recorded, again, under the wiretap requirements.
 Votes should be taken with a roll call, just as we do in an executive session, and remote meeting, remote members, so if there are some people in person and there are some people at home, you must introduce yourselves or be introduced at the meeting, and the camera should be on to the extent that
 someone can have their camera on and they're not participating by phone or for medical reasons, they can't participate with their camera on or they've requested an accommodation.
 When holding an executive session remotely, members of the public body should state that no other person is present, that no one else can hear them.
 Again, that goes to the confidential nature of an executive session.
 And so if we were here tonight, I would say, you know, just so you know, I'm here in a room with the door shut in my office and no one else can hear me.
 That would be sufficient.
 Hybrid meetings.
 Many, I would say the majority of public bodies I work with are meeting in a remote or hybrid manner.
 You can allow
 your members to meet in person, but members of the public can watch a live stream.
 And you can also allow direct participants.
 So if you had a contractor or an engineer or a project manager to attend in person, but the general public could meet remotely.
 And a member may attend remotely if even if other members attend in person.
 The bottom line is essentially if live access stops,
 then the meeting must stop as well.
 If there is troubleshooting or technical difficulties, you do want to be careful, again, not to deliberate over text or email if there is an issue with a technical feed.
 And you can resume the meeting once it's resolved and members of the public are allowed to see the live stream again.
 Public body must be able to hear and follow the meeting from their remote location.
 Okay, so that was a little bit of a, I know a lot of information to take in.
 I'm happy to answer any specific questions that anyone has.
 As I had mentioned, I'm happy to share both these slides as well as additional resources as a open meeting law training kit with all of you and happy to answer any questions along the way.
 and update you with respect to the legislation on the open meeting law changes that may or may not go into effect by the end of next March.

 我认为能力，并非每个城镇或城市都可以建造新的教学建筑并思考未来，尤其是与我目前正在与之合作的学生一起，可以为我们的学生提供平等和文化资本和资源，我认为这将非常重要。
 我喜欢珍妮所说的话，有点共同定位，或者，我喜欢的人都喜欢思考我们的柯蒂斯理工大学的学生确实是这座建筑前进的结构的一部分。

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=4748.33s">[Graham]</a>:  Sure.
 Thank you all for the...
 words of excitement.
 I want to do a couple of things between now and 8pm and we're going to be out the door at 8, I promise.
 But just as a quick time check, two big things.
 One is I want to give you a bit of a sense of what's been happening.
 to lead up to today and where we are in the process.
 So I'm going to talk a little bit about that.
 We're going to bring up a quick presentation to do that.
 And then before we leave tonight, we will form some subcommittees so that we can move quickly on some of the near-term work that we need to do.
 So we'll talk about that in just a minute.
 But Peter, if you can bring up that presentation for me, that would be great.
 OK.
 You can go ahead a couple of pages.
 Keep going, one more.
 Here we go.
 Back in February, we started, so in December, the MSBA invited us to the eligibility period.
 And we'll talk about what the eligibility period means in just a couple of minutes.
 But that invitation said, you're invited to this process, which starts on May 1st.
 So tomorrow we start.
 However, the committee named me the chair of this building committee back in February, and there's a lot of work that has been done so far.
 One of the things that we had to do was find all of you, right?
 So in the context of trying to say, what is it that we want as a school committee for this building committee to do, we established a list of goals.
 There's going to be many, many more goals, but I did want to set the stage of,
 the work that we're going to do for the next five to seven years.
 The first is to plan comprehensively for all programming currently residing on the Medford High School campus, including vocational and non-vocational 9-to-12 education, 9-to-12 athletics, the Medford Family Network, Medford Community Schools programming, early childhood education, including, but not limited to, the Medford Early Education Program, which we call MEAP, and Kids' Corner.
 So there's so much more that goes on in this building than what we think about when we think about a high school.
 So that's one thing for you all to start to think about.
 Number two, what's that?
 Can I take it?
 Oh yeah, and I can share the slides.
 No, no, I can share the slides.
 Yeah, I can share all the slides with you afterwards.
 Number two is to consider whether the placement of Curtis Tufts High School on the Medford campus will provide increased educational opportunities to enrolled students at Curtis Tufts.
 Number three, ensure robust public input and stakeholder feedback and appropriate milestones throughout the project that complies with MSBA guidelines and guidance from the Medford School Committee.
 Listen to educator and administrator input regarding the future of educational best practices and plans for the students of Medford.
 That means we care a lot about functionality.
 So we wanna know that the spaces will work for the students and the teachers in the building.
 It's really, really important.
 Number five, create plans for the building that advances Medford's climate goals and achieves any CHIPS and LEED 5, LEED version 5 certification to meet the Paris Climate Accords 2030 and 2050 targets, and moves efficiently and effectively through the building process in a manner that ensures students are able to learn in the new building as quickly as is feasible.
 So that's a huge task.
 as quickly as is feasible is still measured in years and not in months.
 But in the context of building this committee, once I was designated the chair, we got out the call for applications, we started to collect applications, and all of you are here.
 Meanwhile, there's a lot of work to do in the eligibility phase that we've already begun.
 So we'll talk about that in just a minute.
 But if you can go to the next slide.
 So this is a
 really junky graphic that did not blow up very well from the SBA website.
 But as we're talking about the entire process, right, we are just outside the box for another like six hours.
 On May 1st, we'll hop inside the box into that eligibility period.
 At each of these steps in the process,
 The MSBA will have to sign off that we have completed all of the requirements of that phase.
 There will have to be a board meeting where they vote to invite us to the next phase.
 So at any point in this process, the MSBA could say, you're not ready to move on.
 They could also say, we don't like what you're doing.
 And they could also say, forget about it.
 So our job here is that none of those things happen.
 Our job is that we are going to play this clean, we are going to be comprehensive, and we are going to move as fast as we humanly can.
 Okay, so we're going to give the MSBA a run for their money because we're going to be ready for them.
 Well, we'll see.
 But that eligibility period lasts for 270 days.
 So by January, we have to be done with the eligibility phase.
 I'm going to talk a little bit about what happens in that phase.
 Beyond the eligibility phase, just briefly, when we talk about forming the project team, that means bringing on board our owner's project manager.
 then we go into the feasibility study.
 When people think about what we're doing on this committee, they think we're doing a feasibility study right now.
 They think we're deciding, are we building?
 Are we renovating?
 Where are we building?
 Is it on the field?
 Is it in the parking lot?
 How's it going to work?
 We are not there yet.
 So please tell all your friends
 We will get there and we will work with professionals to help make those assessments on behalf of what we need to do in this building.
 And then we'll move on to schematic design, funding the projects.
 That is where we vote as a community to fund this project.
 I cannot stress how important that will be, but also we've got a lot of work to do before we get there.
 Once that happens, we go into detailed design, then we put a shovel in the ground, and then at some point in future, we complete the project.
 So that's sort of the soup to nuts.
 My goal is that we're just going to take this one step at a time.
 We're going to do what we need to do to be compliant with the eligibility period, and then we're going to move on.
 As we near that next phase, we're going to start talking about how can we accelerate the work.
 But for right now, our focus is eligibility.
 So if you can flip to the next page.
 The eligibility process is its own graphic, which you cannot see.
 So go ahead and flip to the next slide.
 Okay.
 So there are five things that have to happen in this phase.
 One is the initial compliance certification.
 It's a legal agreement that binds the city to comply with the MSBA's process.
 It has been signed and it has been delivered to the MSBA.
 We are one day ahead of schedule and I'm going to own that.
 Thank you, Mayor and Superintendent.
 We're on our way.
 Number two, the building committee has to be formed.
 You're all here.
 The school committee said meet before May 1st and here we are on April 30th.
 We've done it.
 The form will be submitted to the MSBA shortly.
 So we are working on that and that'll be submitted shortly.
 That's obviously the easy part.
 It's paperwork.
 I think
 The whole eligibility phase is a lot of paperwork, but this is the easy stuff.
 And we're just going to get it done and get it out of the way.
 The MSBA will need to sign off on our committee.
 We have met all the requirements.
 So the MSBA has all kinds of things that it requires of us in terms of who is on this committee.
 We've met all of those requirements with all of you here.
 Now we're going to dive into the actual work.
 There's three additional things that have to happen.
 One is what they call an educational profile.
 It's a template document, and it requires us to say, what happens in this building today?
 How many classrooms?
 How many math classrooms?
 How many swing spaces?
 How big is your theater?
 All of it, right?
 So it asks you to describe currently what happens in this building.
 It also asks you to describe what you envision for the future of this building.
 So this is where those conversations about Curtis Tufts, those conversations about early childhood become very, very important.
 Because between our statement of interest and this eligibility phase, educational profile, that will set the tone for how all the construction professionals actually can do their work.
 So this is going to set the scope, as it were, for the work that has to be done to actually get this building put up.
 So there's a lot of work that's been done right now in this process.
 I have been meeting with the administrative team since February.
 We meet multiple times a week.
 They're very sick of me.
 I would be sick of me.
 But one of the things that we have started to do is say, what can we chip away at?
 And so the document is pretty well drafted when it comes to
 What do we do in this building?
 All the classrooms have been counted.
 All the programs have been outlined.
 There's a little bit more work for the administration to do in terms of what happens today to accurately describe that.
 The other thing that is obviously much more complicated is having some conversation around what will we do in this building in the future?
 So in that conversation, again, we've been having a lot of sort of broad conversation.
 We've been sort of tapping into like the strategic planning parts of our brain to ask big questions, and I'm going to use Curtis Tufts just for a quick minute.
 We have had some discussion about do our educators think that is something that we should be thinking about and the answer to that is yes, they said, yes, we should be thinking about that.
 And so we started to say okay what does that look like what might.
 the requirements be.
 So we've started that conversation, but that conversation is bigger than what this committee can sort of chew on because it sort of dabbles in responsibilities of the school committee.
 So last night I served up a resolution asking our special education and behavioral health subcommittee, which is actually chaired by member Rousseau, to have a meeting on a very tight timeline to collect input and feedback
 about that very narrow topic.
 Would co-location of the Curtis-Tufts onto this campus in some capacity be beneficial to the educational outcomes of the students that go to Curtis-Tufts?
 There is another Medford resident who actually spoke last night.
 He is in charge of a very comparable program at Somerville.
 He talked about this transition just happening in Somerville and how it exploded his population.
 It has changed the game for the students who need that alternative setting in terms of access to things like sports teams, in our case, the vocational programs.
 So there's huge, huge opportunity, but
 We want to make sure that the community and the committee have some opportunity to sort of think about all that that might bring to the table and provide a recommendation back to this committee.
 So that has been turfed.
 Last night, officially, to the Special Education Subcommittee, they will meet.
 They will invite current staff, current students, former students,
 community members, etc, etc.
 And Jack Hevery from Somerville to come and talk and work through that and provide a recommendation.
 So they're on their way, that will come back by mid-June.
 So they have their work cut out for them, but that will help us inform
 the drafting of that piece of what we envisioned for this school.
 Because what we likely will need is not just a couple of classrooms somewhere in the building.
 Part of why the Curtis Tufts is successful is because the environment is considerably different than this very, very big campus with 1,200 students.
 So we will have to think carefully about how we craft that.
 But hopefully, the work that the subcommittee does will come back to us and can be sort of funneled in.
 Marta and Chad will come to a future school committee meeting in the coming weeks and Marta will be talking about some of her ideas for alternative programming and what all that might look like even in the short term.
 And so that is something that will have to be sort of folded in.
 Joan and Suzanne and I and Paul had a conversation yesterday about early education.
 Our elementary schools are busting at the seams.
 We'll have to grapple with that problem sometime.
 MEEP used to be housed here.
 And we are going to explore a case that says MEAP should come back here.
 And that may or may not be ultimately where we land, but that is something that we're exploring because now is the time.
 We also talked a lot about
 students who don't have any sort of pre-k education, and as they enter our public schools, just how challenging the entry for those students are.
 And so we are also talking about things like how big is the wait list, and how many students come to us who have never been in some sort of pre-k setting, and what kind of capacity would we need to service a bigger, more comprehensive early education program out of this building, because all of that would need to go into this document.
 So we are working on that.
 So as these things are happening, there's been a lot of work to date on this educational profile.
 The one big piece of educational profile we haven't touched yet is the communication strategy.
 I'll talk about that in just a minute.
 But on the education side, there's so much that our educators have to do for us to be able to get that document pulled together.
 I just want you all to know it's all in process and as we go through our next several meetings we'll bring those documents forward so we can start to do like broader reading of those documents, ask for suggestions, make sure that we are really thinking about all the angles of what we need to describe and so that is where I think all of you play a really important role to say
 I think you need to describe what we're doing here a little bit differently based on what I know or based on sort of what the vision is for the arts programs or for the vocational programs, et cetera, et cetera.
 So that's where we are on the educational profile.
 Curtis Tuft's co-location is in subcommittee.
 The other big sort of newer, newish, changing topic is MEEP.
 What MSBA describes as the reason for delay often in communities is that they're having to make very big decisions that feed their building process.
 Like, do we combine two schools?
 And so that obviously has its own energy and its own set of requirements, which makes it very challenging to be able to move quickly.
 So we are trying to both think very big because this is
 a one-shot opportunity to think about what the district really does need in a very comprehensive way, but also move as fast as possible.
 So all that work has been in progress and moving as quickly as is humanly possible.
 Peter, can you go to the next slide?
 Very similarly on the vocational side, because we have a very active vocational school, we have another document that needs to be filled out, which is a Chapter 74 viability.
 Chapter 74 is the chapter of the regulation that establishes vocational programs, right?
 OK.
 That drafting is in progress.
 We have to tell them, here are the programs we have.
 Here is the capacity of those programs.
 Here is our current enrollment.
 And things like, what is our wait list?
 We also have an opportunity to describe intended expansion of these programs.
 Chad and Peter will be at the school committee talking about potential for expansion.
 That is a school committee matter because expanded program takes much more than just a building.
 It takes equipment, it takes staffing.
 So the school committee has to weigh in on that.
 So that's gonna come before the school committee on May 20th, and that will feed sort of the finalization of
 the chapter 70 form and and this group will read through and sort of get ready for that as well.
 Um, and then there is a piece, um, of the puzzle, which, um, the mayor and the superintendent and I are talking to MSBA about later this week, which is really information around city planning.
 So we can start to, um, feed information into what they call their enrollment study that helps size the building.
 So you've probably heard a lot about this building was built for 4,000 students, and now there's only 1200 that.
 Whether 4,000 was the number or not, I don't know, but it is true that the number is different.
 And so one of the things that the MSBA will do in the eligibility phase is they will say, we're going to build a building for this many students.
 That usually tracks with something like what happens in the building today.
 However, if there's huge planned expansion in the city in terms of housing units going up for development, they're going to want to know all of that.
 So that they can size the building because they don't want us to build a building that is immediately out of capacity.
 They also don't want us to build a building that will never be at capacity, right so so that's some of the work that's happening there.
 Fourth thing, maintenance documents.
 There's a questionnaire that we have to answer that outlines all of our maintenance practices across the district.
 So it's things like, do you do recommissioning?
 And how is your staff trained?
 There's like 20 variables.
 That document is also in draft and moving along as quickly as is humanly possible.
 We'll get to that probably a little bit later in June.
 Final thing that we need to do to be considered done with eligibility is we have to identify funding for the feasibility study, which is probably somewhere in the neighborhood of two and a quarter to two and a half million dollars.
 We're not ready for that yet, but we're making plans.
 The mayor and I are working on what will that plan be from a financial task force perspective, so that that money can be accounted for and cared for as quickly as it is required to be.
 questions about the process.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5920.302s">[Preisner]</a>: 当然。
 因此，当它说地方授权时，这是否暗示选民不会投票？
 不。
 还是暗示
 有钱。
 市政府已经确定了资金。
 正确的。
 全部，其中一部分将得到报销。
 但是我认为授权必须全额。
 正确的。
 FDA将根据我们在报销上的位置告诉您报销是什么。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5944.979s">[Graham]</a>: 正确的。
 因此，可行性，这笔资金将必须涵盖可行性研究的全部费用。
 不是整个项目，只是可行性研究，大约是2至250万美元。
 该市将预先为整个可行性研究付费。
 然后，一旦MSBA证明了我们为该项目的报销率，并且我们将一路成功，他们将重新确定与他们为我们提供的分配百分比相称的可行性研究。
 是的，是的。
 他们将使用相同的公式，并适用于可行性研究并折回城市。
 但是这座城市必须兑现这笔钱。
 所以这里必须发生的是
 我们必须这样做。
 如果我们需要出去选举选民来获取这笔钱，我们必须这样做。
 我们预计我们不需要这样做。
 我们已经制定了一个资金计划，我们应该很好。
 因此，我们还可以，这将需要市议会的投票才能授权资金并将其放在我们可以访问它的地方。
 但是我们在那里状况良好。
 正如我提到的那样，所有这些都必须在一月之前结束。
 每个都有与之相关的特定截止日期。
 我将非常积极进取，并告诉您，我希望所有这些事情在明年开始之前完成。
 无论如何，我希望这些事情能在6月30日之前完成。
 嗯，这就是为什么我们一直在开会，工作和推动。
 嗯，我认为，嗯，这对我们来说很重要。
 因此，让我们来伸展，让我们准备好。
 嗯，MSBA将在获得认证和所有这些方面的招生研究方面，嗯，嗯，但是我希望我们能够为他们提供所需的一切，以便我们可以尽快进入下一个阶段。
 有关时间表的问题。
 好的。
 所以我们只剩20分钟。
 为此，我们在议程的背面列出了许多即将举行的小组委员会会议。
 我希望我们考虑并确定两件事
 进入第一阶段。
 一个是一个沟通和社区参与委员会。
 我想要一个小组委员会，这将不超过七个投票成员，但是一个有兴趣的小组在小组委员会中见面，以真正能够描述和概述我们的社区参与过程。
 我想你们都看到社区中的人们表示关注，梅德福会搞砸吗？
 它可以工作吗？
 会发生吗？
 因此，必须发生巨大的社区宣传。
 我们越早开始，我们最终就会越成功。
 我认为这是一个更大的对话，因为在我看来，我们有
 大量的董事会和佣金。
 他们中的许多人对这个项目感兴趣。
 因此，将需要进行一些宣传才能了解何时以及如何吸引它们，以便我们可以将其推向前进的总体计划。
 我今晚要组成的第二组是规则和入职委员会。
 因此，就像您从珍妮尔（Janelle）那里听到的那样，我们确实必须建立一些关于我们将如何运作的规则，尤其是在公众参与周围，但总的来说。
 我希望这个委员会会有时间有限。
 我希望您可以见面一次，将草稿带回该小组，然后我们可以采用这些规则并从那里进行管理。
 然后，第三委员会不会很快成立，但会见面，
 6月底之前是财务小组委员会。
 因此，这将是一个常设委员会，将在整个项目的一生中开会并继续。
 重要的是要注意，当社区必须投票时，
 该委员会不是该工作发生的地方。
 因此，如果我们谈论最终需要排除债务以资助该项目，那么这个委员会就不是像我们通过债务排除的地方。
 这实际上不能在这里发生。
 它必须发生在这个小组之外。
 嗯，所以这个财政委员会，我认为这是更多，嗯，提供了投入，um和洞察力，以了解我们所有者的项目经理，um um um um，um，um，um um，但也可以帮助我们对可行性的细微调整？
 我们还需要考虑其他费用吗？
 因此，有一些财务工作要做，尽管，嗯，
 您知道，我不希望该小组直到五月晚些时候见面。
 因此，我们将在下次会议上谈论更多关于罗伯特的秩序规则和所有这些。
 我知道是，每个人都喜欢看着我，请停止说话。
 是8。
 所以我认为我感兴趣的是，如果有人听到任何主题，我真的想成为
 这些小组委员会之一，您可以识别自己吗？
 而且我还要礼貌地建议学校管理员可能会放下手，因为您有自己的工作要为我们刚刚描述的所有内容做好准备。
 因此，您100％欢迎您。
 要参加，但我们需要您在学校委员会介绍。
 我们需要约翰和彼得来帮助制定这些维护计划等。
 因此，如果有些人对任何其他主题都感兴趣，那么委员会就不会太大，但是我们认为必须有任何规模来完成工作。
 因此，那些小组委员会将它们放在日历上。
 我们将在这些晚上完全缩放，只是为了使事情变得容易一些。
 但是，您知道，在5月13日的下一次会议上，每个人都会有一个非常具体的交付，这是为了恢复其提议的草稿。
 有志愿者吗？
 是的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6321.323s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 对于另外两个。
 指定多少？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6325.707s">[Graham]</a>: 我认为可以是任何人。
 它不能超过七个投票成员。
 但是我认为，如果我们从字面上把所有的学校工作人员都带到了桌子上，那么我就不会太担心我们会绊倒。
 但是，我对做自己喜欢做的​​事情的人更感兴趣，非常适合他们所热衷的工作。
 谢谢。
 玛丽亚。
 通讯。
 谢谢。
 特雷西。
 规则。
 好的。
 通讯。

 惊人的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6367.334s">[Libby Brown]</a>: 我的意思是，我可以穿两个，看看是否有足够的通信或财务。
 好的。

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6374.859s">[Graham]</a>: 我要把你纳入金融。

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6385.438s">[Graham]</a>: 和菲奥娜，金融。
 我们也可以签下鲍勃（Bob）以筹集资金吗？
 伟大的。
 是的，绝对。
 这些委员会还有其他接受者吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6402.244s">[Preisner]</a>: 如果您没有足够的财务。
 好的，我将把您列入列表。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6412.739s">[Graham]</a>: 有两个人有规则和入职。
 那是正确的。
 我打算坐在所有委员会上，但也许我们可以要求艾米丽·拉扎罗（Emily Lazzaro）遵守规则和入职小组委员会。
 嗯，所以我会和她联系，但是，嗯，我也把妮可·莫雷尔（Nicole Morell）放在了交流小组委员会上。
 所以，嗯，我们会和他们一起检查，但是还有其他人感到强烈的感觉，还是您想去？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6447.185s">[Olapade]</a>: 好吧，太好了。
 好吧，我本来要说的是财务，但是我绝对没有太多的经验。

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6461.327s">[Parkinson]</a>: 我认为对于小组中的所有实际技术人员，</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6470.157s">[Graham]</a>: 在我们走得太远之前，将有一个工作组，必须为所有者的项目经理整理RFP。
 那不是我拥有的专业知识。
 这不是我在这里的原因。
 因此，随着时间的流逝，我们将依靠每个人的不同小组委员会。
 这只是我近乎我认为我们应该开始的。
 这有意义吗？
 是否有人对必须要发生的事情有其他建议？
 我有一个问题。
 当然。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6499.089s">[Larry Brown]</a>: 您提到的是柯蒂斯（Curtis）可能来到这里以及该设施的所有这些用途。
 谁在探索这些选项，即
 就像社区ED一样，就像在社区大学一起工作一样，像我在那儿的晚间课程一样，希望与AGC总承包商协会一起进行成人教育。
 有人吗
 在桌子上放一堆选项，你们喜欢考虑还是怎么回事？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6534.345s">[Graham]</a>: 是的，有点不是，但不是完全。
 我们还不到那儿。
 因此，我认为一旦我们经历了第74章的最初腮红，就像我们对此添加它可能是有意义的。
 因此，当我们开始阅读这些文件时，我认为这是一个好时机，例如，我们还需要与谁联系？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6554.235s">[Larry Brown]</a>: 因为所有这些东西都会影响
 您知道，可访问性，邻近性，设施的大小与其他设施，存储，停车位。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6563.741s">[Graham]</a>: 好的，是的，我认为这是一个好主意。
 我要把它放在列表中。
 是的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6568.884s">[Ruseau]</a>: 实际上，我们受到我们城市的限制。
 我们是。
 如果房间里的每个人都喜欢，联邦政府应该在这里。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6577.15s">[Parkinson]</a>: 它不在城市。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6585.563s">[Graham]</a>: 但是社区学校是。
 是的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6595.083s">[Preisner]</a>: 好的。
 是的，所以我想问，您知道，谁将用任何形式的数字基础架构来资源？
 因此，我将引用SOI。
 有soi。
 有调查给了SOI。
 可能还有其他公共文档列表实际上不可公开访问，但应该是。
 您知道，这个沟通社区参与小组委员会将承担
 传达同样的事情可能会给许多人。
 是的，这是通过网站，也许是通过共享存储库来完成的，当然可能有一个外在的面对面
 您知道，门户就像一个网站一样，就像每个拥有这些项目之一的学校，然后是一个后端存储库，Sheldon可以在其中查看这样的原因，例如，为什么它可以随时随地可用于会员，或者您知道在访问列表中有点像。
 当然。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6657.678s">[Graham]</a>: 我可以给你更新。
 我们明白了。
 因此，我们实际上采购了该委员会独有的URL，并且是buildingmhs.org。
 那对吗？
 好的。
 因此，URL存在。
 页面存在。
 托马斯实际上正在研究该社区资源的骨骼。
 我们要求大家提供BIOS和图片的原因是所有这些都会在网站上进入，因此他正在努力担任通信总监。
 汤姆已经同意，即使他是即将离任的通讯总监，也要专门为这个项目继续前进，直到我们雇用他的替代者。
 因此，该网站是由托马斯（Thomas）和我们的一些职业学生建立的，我假设在丽莎·米勒（Lisa Miller）的领导下。
 并且将有一个文档组成部分，其中所有这些公开访问的文件都将是，当有人说，这在哪里？
 我们可以将它们指向一个地方。
 我们所有的会议记录都将去那里。
 我们所有的会议议程都将去那里。
 因此，我们已经有一个完整的结构来尝试这样做。
 我们还没有准备好，但是我希望下次会议能够为我们的论坛进行巡回演出。
 那个网站。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6731.704s">[Preisner]</a>: 好的。
 嗯，因此跟进就是那是外在的门户。
 对我们的后端怎么样？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6738.866s">[Graham]</a>: 因此，这是一个棘手的问题，因为根据公开会议法，我们确实没有后端。
 一旦发布议程，其所有文件都是公开记录的一部分。
 而且，如果是的话，如果我们正在幕后工作，那么棘手的是，我们很可能违反了公开会议法。
 因此，管理员拥有正在处理的文档的工作副本，他们不代表法定人数，他们可以继续这样做。
 一旦这些文件来到这里，它们将被放置在公开的驱动器中。
 当我们谈论编辑文件时，该委员会没有脱机编辑。
 根据公开会议法律不允许。
 因此，不幸的是，我们将痛苦地坐在这里并共同编辑文档。
 它确实是管理大家注册的此过程中最痛苦的部分之一。
 对不起。
 但是，是的，这是令人难以置信的痛苦，但是离线的，这种离线编辑在世界上其他每个地方都不是有效地有效地奏效的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6811.109s">[Preisner]</a>: 好的，所以没有Google Drive，没有共享的文件，就会发布任何内容。
 当它们发布时，它们会出现在网站上。
 当它们出现在网站上时，它们本质上是配置控制，除非在此处进行这些更改，否则无法更改。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6826.757s">[Graham]</a>: 正确的。
 是的。
 绝对可怕。
 我们已经找到了使它变得不那么糟糕的方法，但可悲的是，它的程度不那么糟糕。
 这是在文档的编辑方式上与社区中的热水融入热水中的一种肯定方式。
 因此，将会，当我们这样做时，我发现这些会议在Zoom方面更加有效。
 您可以坐在需要坐的地方，每个人都可以观看文档的编辑，并且没有任何想法是，该文档的编辑而没有公开发生。
 因此，我们必须在此上轻轻踩踏。
 但是，是的，这是一个过程。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6903.643s">[Parkinson]</a>: 完全错误的政策，40名成员。
 一位成员就像西蒙一样，只需确保您在后面，然后像在那儿写我们的评论并将其放在一起。
 答案是否。
 因此，您确实输入了您的评论，回应您，他们就像，好的，认可。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6926.232s">[Galusi]</a>: 是的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6926.472s">[Parkinson]</a>: 只是，我们很抱歉。
 这就像，我们同意这可能是最大的</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6933.462s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 是的。
 再次感谢您在这里。
 我也对Comms的作品非常感兴趣，尽管工作很不错，但是我很高兴总是接听电话。
 他们会回到这里。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6948.428s">[Graham]</a>: 所有这些更新都将回到这里。
 我可以回答有关小组委员会或议程上其他任何其他问题的问题？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6958.671s">[King]</a>: 我有一个问题。
 我有一个关于投票的问题。
 是的，当我们投票时。
 是的，我们不是。
 我从未遇到过的一件事是允许代理。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6972.628s">[Graham]</a>: 不。
 不，不是。
 会议允许代理吗？
 不，您无法将投票分配给其他人。
 在我们休会期间，我们将进行投票，因为我们必须投票以押后会议。
 通常，这将通过他们所谓的声音投票发生，每个人都刚才说是的，我们走了。
 我们只是要练习打个电话，因为它是
 再次，怪异而尴尬。
 因此，我们将这样做以休会会议。
 但是在我们休会会议之前，还有其他问题吗？
 他在关注。
 但是我认为另一件事值得描述的是，该委员会中有许多无投票成员。
 原因不是因为我们不想收到您的来信。
 您在这里，因为我们想收到您的来信。
 当投票发生时，我们将不会叫您的姓名，您将不会投票。
 但是除此之外，您是本委员会的正式成员。
 我警告说
 当您有太多投票成员时，开展业务变得非常困难，因为您必须有一个委员会的法定人数才能见面并开展业务。
 一切变得非常非常复杂。
 因此，这是我们尝试说的，我们想拥有一个大型的圆委员会，但是我们还需要能够喜欢有效，有效和所有这些东西的行动。
 这就是背后的基本原理。
 我们在那里做了什么。
 而且，您知道，您知道，这个委员会的规模肯定会在整个生活中发生变化。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7068.989s">[King]</a>: 那25个？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7070.309s">[Graham]</a>: 是的，委员会有15个投票成员，这仍然是很多投票成员。
 我们将在短短一秒钟内练习投票。
 但是下一会议还有其他问题吗？
 规则，规则和5月7日社区参与的登机，他们将于5月13日将他们的发现带回该小组。
 因此，我们5月13日的会议中的绝大多数属将通过这些建议来努力，同意这些计划。
 同样，我们有点处于开始模式。
 然后在那之后，我们将进入政府一直在努力并开始的其中一些文件的肉
 仔细阅读那些文档，谈论有什么和这种事情。
 但是我们要快速移动。
 我们确实通过一些理由来列出会议时间表。
 我们将在489 Bishop 489的亲自见面。
 从现在到6月底。
 我向您保证，我们将回到下一学年开始的星期一晚上。
 但是，从现在到6月底，在学校委员会会议和假期之间，实际上不可能按照这种时间表完全不可能。
 我们将仅在夏季通过Zoom开会，实际上，我们实际上将会议转移到了星期三，考虑到星期一和星期五在夏天真的很难让任何人做任何事情。
 因此，希望我们能做到这一点，但是我确实试图保持会议时间表的亮度。
 我认为从现在到八月底，将会有更多的小组委员会，但这只是一个开始，因此人们可以尝试组织忙碌的生活。
 是的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7178.606s">[Parkinson]</a>: 那是一个代理问题。
 如果你不能做到。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7183.63s">[Joan Bowen]</a>: 没关系。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7184.27s">[Parkinson]</a>: 发送您的所有想法和评论也发送电子邮件。
 椅子，你的声音消失了。
 所以，嗯，</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7205.75s">[Preisner]</a>: 实际上，这是一个技术问题。
 因此，绅士无法让会议向您发送一封电子邮件，指示他的想法和建议，甚至可能是决定。
 早些时候，我们听说电子邮件是一个坏主意，除了议程设置之外。
 因此，这听起来像一个灰色区域。
 我想知道，所以您知道公开会议法，这两件事正在冲突。
 它如何工作？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7232.16s">[Graham]</a>: 因此，我可以告诉您，我认为任何律师都会告诉您不要以书面形式放任何东西，对吗？
 这就是我们开始的地方。
 不要以书面形式放任何东西。
 话虽如此，如果您要以书面形式将某些内容放在这种情况下，是的，这是一个灰色的区域。
 您应该做的是与某人联系，然后说，嘿，我可以向您发送我的想法吗？
 您是否与其他任何人讨论过这些事情？
 因此，如果您可以合理地确定自己有闭路电路，对吗？
 你对我说，我可以给你发我的想法吗？
 我说，是的。
 我说，我不会和其他任何人谈论这些问题，那我们就很好。
 只有当您与许多代表委员会投票多数的人建立联系时，这才成为一个问题。
 例如，如果您说，我想告诉两个人，因为我不确定谁会真正参加会议，那还可以，因为您是八岁的南部。
 当您与自己交谈时，包括八个人，现在您有麻烦了。
 那是您违反公开会议法的时候。
 棘手的部分是，每个参与的人都必须对谁参与该对话有同样的了解。
 我想念什么？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7312.233s">[Parkinson]</a>: 您可能是非常有意的。
 我只是告诉你，你就像，嗯。
 然后您去做同样的事情。
 无论我们为捍卫法律做什么，我们都在违反法律。
 因此，我认为绘制一行非常有趣。
 这是连续审议并不关心任何事情。
 这不是满足，计划或保险。
 只是我们两个人，对吗？
 是的。
 你去违反。
 我违反了法律。
 即使我不知道。
 对，对。
 好吧，是的，这很好。
 我们决定了吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7350.203s">[Graham]</a>: 我们将在梅德福公立学校下为每个人提供一个电子邮件地址。
 而且，我强烈建议您在任何情况下不要在与MSBA有关的任何业务中使用您的个人电子邮件。
 因此，一旦设置了这些电子邮件，我们将转换所有内容。
 但是我强烈建议您不要将您的个人电子邮件用于任何事情。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7369.017s">[Parkinson]</a>: 它使公共记录合规性更可怕。
 我是学区的记录访问官。
 除了您的个人票据以外，在公共票据以外的任何其他文件都可以自动提供或至少可以审查，如果有人要求它们。
 因此，在Medford公立学校的电子邮件地址，在您的Medford公立学校Google Suite中，您可以做笔记和类似的事情，这确实有助于将其全部包含在该空间中。
 有最后一个问题吗？
 是8.03。
 我们只是喜欢罗伯特的规则休会。
 是否有休会的动议？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7429.79s">[Graham]</a>: 由成员Olapade押后的动议，由Ruseau成员借调。
 谢谢。
 哦，你不能。
 由Edouard-Vincent博士借调。
