 根据今晚的一些计划，我们将于八点出发。
 我们八点多就出发。
 首先，我要稍微改变一下议程，因为 KP Law 的 Janelle 在这里进行一些公开会议法律培训。
 所以我们暂时跳过介绍。
 这样 Janelle 就可以在培训时进行公开会议，因为她有一个会议下半年的承诺。
 所以我想确保她有足够的时间把它放进去。
 但在我们这样做之前，我要快速点名一下，以便我们知道谁在这里。
 珍妮格雷厄姆在这里。

 布朗夫人。
 这里。
 玛丽莎·德斯蒙德、玛丽亚·多尔西、布莱恩·希利亚德，他缺席了。
 特雷西·基恩、艾米丽·拉扎罗缺席。
 她今晚有一个理事会会议。
 妮可·莫雷尔缺席。
 她之前有过冲突。
 亚伦·洛帕特、卢克·普雷斯纳、拉里·布朗、鲍勃·迪金森，他今晚不在这里。

 我相信托马斯·道尔顿、查德·法伦即将到来。
 洛里·霍奇金、约翰·麦克劳克林、保罗·卢梭和菲利普·桑托斯今晚缺席。
 他也开了一个会议。
 所以我们有法定人数。
 只需几分钟您就会明白为什么这很重要。
 但我马上就把它交给珍妮尔。
 但我想我首先要说的是，我们所有的会议都遵守公开会议法。
 凭借四年的公开会议经验，这是一种非常笨拙的完成工作的方式。
 所以我只想说这是我的个人经历。
 它的存在是有原因的。
 这是绝对必要的，但它要求你们所有人不仅仔细考虑您在会议中所说和所做的事情，而且更重要的是，您在会议之外的行为方式，因为
 您可能会无意中发现自己与公开会议法发生冲突。
 MSB 要求我们按照公开会议法举行所有会议，因此我们认为每个人都必须有一定的基础，这一点很重要。
 嗯，房间里的民选官员显然熟悉公开会议法，可以为任何有疑问的人提供指导。
 我刚刚和他们签约了。
 嗯，我想对房间里的教育工作者说，就像您通常一直与学校委员会互动一样，您通常不受公开会议法的约束，但在这个房间里，在这个主题上，您是受制于的。
 所以这只是一种调整
 您以这种方式承担一系列责任。
 所以我要把它交给珍妮尔。
 Janelle，请告诉我们您是否想在整个过程中提出问题，或者希望我们保留我们的问题，直到您完成为止。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=405.964s">[Austin]</a>:  Sure.
 Thank you so much.
 Can everyone hear me okay?
 Yes.
 Thank you so much for having me this evening.
 Happy to present on this very important topic of the open meeting law.
 I will dive into the public records law a little bit to the extent there's a little bit of overlap.
 I always think it's a good idea to cover these topics.
 Certainly I agree in terms of open meeting law compliance.
 I represent the city of Method, other communities across the state, and we are seeing a significant uptick in open meeting law compliance.
 So certainly a good opportunity to provide best practices, talk a little bit in terms of
 you know, what your role is in terms of open meeting law compliance, and I understand that some members may be more familiar than others, so I'll try to start with best practices, and I think that's always a good idea.
 If there are certainly any questions after the training,
 or along the way, I think we can feel free to interject.
 I'm an informal person, as many of you know, happy to have this be a conversation.
 If someone feels more comfortable speaking to me after the training, I'm certainly happy to make myself available as well.
 And the mayor has my contact information, happy to provide that.
 I would also start by saying certification is really important.
 So for any member that hasn't already completed their open meeting law certification, I recommend that be done as soon as possible.
 The new Attorney General has put forth a new updated open meeting law guide.
 last year.
 That's available on the Division of Open Government's website.
 I'm happy to circulate the link after this, but in my opinion, if any members are due for their open meeting law certification or for any new members, it's a good idea and certainly required under the open meeting law that that be conducted.
 We are going to cover best practices tonight where this is a public meeting.
 I don't want to go into any specifics or anything that may invoke the open meeting law in a non-confidential way.
 Certainly if there are any questions, happy to follow up afterwards.
 I think I have the ability to share my screen.
 So I wanted to go through the slides that I have.
 And again, if anyone has any particular questions, happy to either interject.
 I won't take offense or go from there.
 Can everyone see the slides okay?
 Great.
 So we're here tonight to talk about the open meeting law.
 I'm gonna talk about best practices.
 I'm gonna go through the sort of fundamentals of the open meeting law.
 We certainly start with the premise that the open meeting law, public records and conflict of interest law throughout the country are really, you know, aimed at government transparency and to eliminate secrecy in terms of the work.
 that you all are doing.
 So we know that under the open meeting law, public bodies such as yourself that are subject to the open meeting law can generally only conduct public business through their public meetings, unless there's a specific exemption applies called an executive session, which would allow you to have a confidential meeting.
 And we'll cover that a little bit further in the training.
 But in essence, the open meeting law regulates the process by which public meetings can be held and conducted.
 And there are really several components to what the open meeting law requires.
 So one, what types of meetings are subject to the law?
 What rules need to be followed to hold a meeting sufficient to give members of the public notice?
 And what are the common violations and why?
 And I think this is always a good idea to cover, again, not to scare anyone or detract from any of the important work that you all are doing, but really just so we're all aware of what the Attorney General's Division of Open Government requires in terms of enforcement, and really to make sure everyone's on the same page with respect to the work and business of the committee.
 The open meeting law addresses four major issues, so I want to cover those in detail.
 And apologies if this is, you know, some information that many of the members may have, but I think it's always a good idea to do a refresher.
 We know that the open meeting law requires notice.
 Essentially, it requires that postings be conducted no more than 48 weekday hours prior to the meeting.
 We know that the
 notice has to be posted in a location accessible 24 hours a day, including the website, and the meeting has to be held in an accessible location under the ADA.
 If you are meeting virtually or in a hybrid format, we can talk about that.
 Certainly, information should be available so members of the public know how to log in at home, and any location that you're meeting in person should be accessible as well.
 We also know that the meeting notice or the agenda should have detailed subject matter items, so we'll talk a little bit about what that means.
 But it's a detailed list of topics that you will all review so that a member of the public can look at that meeting notice at home and say, yes, I'd like to attend the meeting because I know these topics are going to be covered, or no, I'm going to pass on this one and go to the next one.
 someone should be able to say, I understand what this meeting is about and I want to attend this meeting based on what's on the meeting notice.
 We're going to talk a little bit about the nature of the meeting.
 As I mentioned at the beginning, there's a presumption under the open meeting law because of government transparency issues for an open session.
 So the meetings conducted as we're meeting tonight in an open session so members of the public can see in real time
 what the public body is doing, the votes that are being conducted and the deliberation, and we'll talk about what that means, of the body's business and the public business being conducted.
 There are certain pretty narrowly tailored reasons for a closed or an executive session, and we'll talk about the procedures if you do end up meeting in executive session.
 Conduct of the meeting, this is a hot,
 hot topic in recent years, essentially, you know, what rules govern public comment?
 What are the free speech principles that may apply?
 Who gets to speak and when in remote and hybrid meetings?
 So we'll cover that.
 And then the fourth major component of the open meeting law is the meeting minutes themselves.
 Essentially the content of the meeting, detailed enough, similar to a meeting notice to allow someone that wasn't present
 to know what transpired or what took place at the meeting.
 The timing for drafting and approving those meeting minutes, essentially for an open meeting within three meetings or 30 days, whichever is later, is a standard that the Attorney General's Division of Open Government established.
 And we'll talk about the process to do that.
 Most of the public bodies that I work with
 usually have them approved at a, you know, an open meeting of the public body for any meeting minutes, but some decide to designate that task to the chair or to another individual.
 That's a policy decision, but we can talk about that if anyone has any questions on that as well.
 So we'll go through the overview essentially.
 48 hours, I can't tell you how important that is prior to the date of the meeting.
 So certainly to be cognizant of
 legal holidays, vacation schedules, certainly as the summer months come up and there's various holidays in play, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, as well as July 4th, something to be aware of as you schedule meetings that it's 48 weekday hours, not including holidays or weekends.
 The meeting notice should list all the topics with specificity.
 And regardless of whether the meeting was posted correctly,
 We know that the open meeting law says that a meeting occurs whenever a quorum of your public body discusses matters within its jurisdiction.
 So we're gonna spend a lot of time on email practices and text message practices, because I certainly agree with the statement at the beginning of the meeting, that in essence, it's just as important what occurs outside of a public body's meeting under the open meeting law as to what occurs during a meeting.
 So we're gonna talk about pitfalls and some things to be careful of relative to your work.
 And essentially something that I see all the time and to be careful about is that we know that a quorum can be reached regardless of whether an email goes to the entire public body or whether it goes to several members and then it's forwarded to other members.
 So we're gonna talk about that.
 We call that serial communications and it's something with the,
 you know, explosion and all of us use technology all the time.
 It's something to be aware of, certainly, as you serve relative to the open meeting law to not get into a situation where there's deliberation over email or text message or other social media mechanisms.
 Subcommittees, I don't know if you intend to create any subcommittees, but certainly wanting to review that as well as we provide an overview.
 A subcommittee is also subject to the open meeting law.
 The intent to create a subcommittee essentially is not required, and the attorney general will look to determine whether or not the subcommittee is within government, empowered to act collectively in serving a public purpose.
 So generally speaking, unless there's an exception, and we'll talk about that, a subcommittee of your committee is essentially subject to the open meeting law.
 just as the entire compliment would be.
 You know, there are exceptions to that.
 If the mayor created a subcommittee to advise just herself or the superintendent did, where they are not individually subject to the open meeting law, a subcommittee created by them wouldn't be.
 It's a very fact specific analysis.
 So we just wanna be really careful with respect to the creation of subcommittees or working groups or task forces.
 to determine whether or not they are subject to the open meeting law.
 Some practical ways, I try to be practical as many of you know, to avoid violations of the open meeting law.
 One person reporting back to the public body doesn't create a subcommittee.
 And if multiple members are using, doing work on behalf of the public body, you would wanna post a meeting and comply with the open meeting law.
 Any questions so far?
 Okay, I'll continue on.
 Some tips to stay out of trouble.
 And this is all things that I've seen in advising municipalities since 2006 on open meeting law and public records issues.
 So it certainly comes from experience.
 If you are attending a meeting of another public body, school committees, city council,
 the city of Method.
 Um another.
 I'm sure you're all very involved in the city of Method and the work that the city does.
 You want to avoid creating the appearance, whether that be at another public bodies meeting or social event or community event.
 Um that you are discussing matters within this public bodies jurisdiction.
 Um I've handled open meeting law complaints or issues over the years where there's an
 or there was a community event and I think that they were talking about X, Y and Z. So certainly you wanna avoid the appearance that you are discussing municipal business.
 To the extent you need to meet jointly with the city council or the school committee or another public body, you can post a joint meeting to be held at the same time and place and then minutes would be prepared just as they would for any other meeting that you may have.
 If you're doing a site visit, certainly,
 best practice may be to send a representative to report back, and then that content is included in the next session's meeting minutes.
 You don't want to be in a position where there's a site visit at a particular location, for instance, that is not accessible.
 And then we're going to spend a lot of time tonight on email, but I can't reiterate this enough to try to avoid the use of email or text messages or social media.
 amongst a quorum of your public body.
 Locations, you're gonna wanna file your meeting notice with the city clerk and they're online as well.
 Some best practices with respect to using your or posting your meeting notice.
 I would recommend not using acronyms or abbreviations.
 Really someone that just moved to the city of Method should be able to pick it up and say,
 I understand what's going on at this meeting.
 We all that do work with public bodies and public entities understand terms like MSBCA or MSBA, DEP, you know, DEF DESI, but certainly, you know, for the first time, you may want to spell it out just so everyone knows what is being discussed.
 The meeting notice should indicate the date and time of the posting.
 And if you do revise it, I don't know what the practice is going to be.
 You're going to want to include both the date that it was originally drafted and then the revised date as well.
 And that should be done 48 hours, 48 business hours in advance.
 Regularly occurring items do need some more detail than just these examples that I've used.
 What we know from recent determinations from the Division of Open Government is that more detail is better than less detail, so we don't really want to use categories such as new business, old business, or departmental report.
 We really want to specify, for instance, correspondence and list if there's any notable correspondence or
 you know, budget analysis and list any particular reports, for instance, that are going to be done.
 So I would recommend erring on the side of more, not less specificity, which should be helpful to alert members of the public about the exact topics that are going to be discussed.
 Any questions on any of this?
 Great.
 Some practical considerations, and this does come up obviously from time to time, scheduling matters or space limitations.
 Generally, a meeting may not be continued from one night to the next as a matter of course, unless that continuation is posted under the open meeting law.
 So if you couldn't meet tonight, would have to reschedule this meeting and repost it for the new date and time.
 And the notice requirement under the open meeting law doesn't substitute or supersede any other notice requirements if you have them under any other legal requirements.
 So always worth double checking to make sure you're covering any publication notice or anything else that may be required.
 Emergencies.
 I can't tell you how many questions I get regarding emergencies, particularly in the winter months with inclement weather.
 There are very limited instances when a public body can meet without that 48 hours notice that's required.
 Poor planning doesn't equal an emergency.
 We know from determinations of the Attorney General's office.
 So if there was just a mishap with respect to scheduling, and I certainly understand everyone's doing the best they can, and you certainly have a lot of schedules to figure out,
 with respect to the public body's business, but generally an emergency is limited to natural disasters, public health matters, and public safety issues.
 So something to be aware of.
 We can talk a little bit about if something's unanticipated, that's a little bit different, but hosting is really limited in the emergency context.
 If you do have an emergency you really need to meet,
 There's a specific reason why the 48 hours couldn't have been, it couldn't have been posted with the 48 hours.
 You do want to comply with the open meeting law to the extent you can, and really limit deliberations to just that emergency matter.
 You're gonna take meeting minutes of that emergency meeting, and then you'd wanna post a follow-up meeting where you basically ratify the action that was taken at the emergency.
 So let's hope for no emergencies.
 but just wanted to make sure everyone had that information as well.
 Conducting meetings.
 So we're gonna move a little bit from the notice piece of this and the agenda piece of the open meeting law to now how those meetings are conducted.
 These are topics that I often receive a lot of questions about.
 So I just wanted to make sure everyone had the best practices related to these particular topics of the open meeting law.
 We know that
 If the meeting is being recorded, similar to whether it be on Zoom or in person, that there should be a public statement or notification to the public through the technological means that the meeting minute is going to be recorded.
 And the basis of that is the Massachusetts wiretap statute.
 We can't secretly record anyone in Massachusetts.
 If an individual wants to record the meeting on their own, it's not otherwise recorded.
 So if someone shows up to an in-person meeting, it used to be when I started doing this, it would be the big, you know, the big recording device with a tripod that we had the old VCR tapes for.
 Now, of course, it's iPhones.
 The individual must inform the chair of their intent to do the recording.
 And then the chair would make the required announcement to the public body
 members as well as members of the public indicating that the meeting was going to be recorded.
 In my opinion, the chair can decide to reasonably regulate the recording placement.
 Obviously, as technology is smaller and smaller, this is less of an issue, but we don't want to block anyone's view, so to speak.
 And people can be in a position where they're not interrupting or there's no disorderly conduct in the meeting themselves.
 Any questions on recordings?
 Nope.
 Okay, thank you.
 Email.
 I would say, I'm going to try to do the math here.
 70 to 80% of the open meeting law complaints that I deal with relate to the use of email, text messages, or other social media mechanisms.
 So I say that again, we all use technology, it's efficient, it's quick,
 It garners a quick response and certainly, I'm sure you all use it, you know, in your other lives, professional lives, personal lives.
 But really, the open meeting law does not encourage the use of email or other text messages by members of the public body to conduct their business.
 Email is explicitly addressed in the open meeting law, and it is often the reason I see for a violation to be determined by the Attorney General's office.
 And what the law requires is that a quorum, either collectively, so reply all situation, or, you know, a group of individuals or one individual forwards it to another who forwards another, can constitute an open meeting law violation.
 Members should really be cautious and a best practice would be not to use email to share ideas, beliefs, opinions, concerns, whether serially or in a single email regarding business.
 And you can't use another member to, you can't send an email to a non-public body member to then circulate out to the group as well.
 Some practical approaches, certainly beware to reply all on emails and really limit
 the use of email to scheduling purposes only and try to avoid using it to undertake business.
 We should always assume that emails could be forwarded to, you know, a local blogger, put on Facebook, sent to the newspaper.
 I've seen it before.
 So we really want to be very considerate of the use of email.
 And this is where there is the overlap with the public records law
 because even if you're volunteers, emails or text messages or social media posts that are made in your official capacity or in relation to your service on this committee really are subject to the public records law as well.
 And so if you use a Gmail account or a personal cell phone to send an email or a text message, and there is a public records request for that,
 that certainly would be subject to the public records law, most likely.
 So just something to be very cognizant of as you begin your service.
 Is there a question?
 No, I think we're good.
 Okay, great.
 Thank you.
 Texting and social media, texting and social media, similar, also subject to the open meeting law.
 Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, Reddit, all of those are subject to the public records law and the open meeting law to the extent there is deliberation.
 If you are a user of social media, certainly in your individual capacity, you have free speech and first amendment considerations.
 So I'm not gonna speak directly to your individual rights, but certainly some practical approaches if you are posting on your service, you don't wanna direct comments to your other members,
 And if a matter directly involves issues pending, you might wanna consider not engaging.
 Certainly again, be thoughtful about the comments that are made and consider using separate accounts if you do run for something.
 Remember that applicants or any individual before you has due process rights.
 So certainly something to be cognizant of as well.
 The open meeting law,
 does not mandate, we're gonna talk a little bit about the authority of the chair in public comment, does not mandate that any particular person be allowed to speak at a meeting.
 So that's something we've seen a particular uptick in, both with respect to First Amendment auditors across the state, and also I'll talk a little bit about a case that came out last year that is really important.
 The open meeting law doesn't require that you even allow public participation or public comment, though I certainly understand that most public bodies do.
 The open meeting law indicates that the chair essentially has the sole discretion as to who may speak and for how long.
 So comments are directed through the chair, as you know.
 And while public comment isn't required under the open meeting law,
 allowing the public to speak during your meeting or restricting any speech, other than based on time, place, and manner restrictions, and we'll talk about what that means, does have serious constitutional implications.
 So certainly if you do allow public comment,
 all of the decisions as to who's going to speak or for how long should be content neutral.
 So not based on the particular message for a speaker or what that individual says, but just based on the time that's allotted.
 Some public bodies I work with say 15 minutes of public comment, everyone gets two or three minutes, people are allowed to speak once or twice depending on how busy the agenda is.
 And some have adopted public comment policies as well.
 So certainly something to put out there to all of you to consider.
 And we'll talk a little bit more about public comment, but the chair does have the authority to regulate it subject to those constitutional restrictions.
 Public participation, whether or not to allow public participation is a significant policy decision.
 here are a couple of factors for all of you to consider.
 When will the public participation period occur?
 Is it going to be at the beginning of the meeting?
 Is it going to be in the middle of the meeting or at the end of the meeting?
 How long will it be?
 You know, like I said, 10, 15 minutes is usually what I see, but there are some meetings where warrants particular input from members of the public.
 And so you all may decide a half an hour or an hour
 We just want to make sure it's equal across the board for anyone that wants to speak.
 How long will each person be allowed to speak and whether or not each person can speak more than once.
 So conducting the meeting, policy issues for public comment periods, any rules about public participation must relate to the process.
 such participation and cannot relate to any speech protected by constitutional principles.
 Any restrictions on an individual's speech must be narrowly tailored.
 So again, try to give some practical advice here, items to consider.
 During a public comment period, you certainly want to avoid a debate to the extent you can.
 You want to avoid responding before you've had the time or opportunity to discuss it or if the matter is controversial.
 And it is perfectly fine, both under the open meeting law, as well as under constitutional considerations, to just leave matters raised during public comment unresolved.
 They're not on the meeting agenda itself.
 And so it may be something that you decide to put on a
 a future meeting agenda so that members, the public that may be interested in the topic can come to the next meeting and say, okay, this is going to be reviewed.
 We're going to have an open discussion.
 We're going to be able to deliberate on it.
 So some practical items to consider there.
 Matters not reasonably anticipated by the chair that are going to be discussed by all of you must be added to the agenda.
 after the posting deadline to the extent feasible.
 And I'll give an example of that.
 If you are going to designate a staff member or someone else to work on your agenda, you wanna make sure that that person understands that it has to be added as soon as possible.
 And like we had talked about at the beginning with respect to the meeting notice, the updated agenda should show the original date as well as the date that it was changed.
 Matters not reasonably anticipated by the chair may be discussed and acted upon, but the Attorney General's Office does recommend, unless it requires immediate attention, it really should be put off to a later meeting and included in that meeting posting.
 So it really is, was this matter so time-sensitive, but yet unanticipated that it had to be discussed at this meeting?
 We updated the meeting agenda,
 and we're going to essentially discuss it, or can we put it off to the next meeting because it isn't time sensitive and it really could have been anticipated based on the totality of the circumstances.
 Any questions on any of that?
 I know it's a lot of content.
 Anything from any of the members?
 Looks like we're good so far.
 Okay, thank you so much.
 Meeting minutes, I don't know if you've all determined how the meeting minutes will be prepared or created and approved, but wanted to make sure, and I'll make these slides available to anyone that wants them after the meeting.
 I'll certainly circulate them so you have them as well as some other materials that may be helpful as a little open meeting log guide.
 The date, time, and place of the meeting and members present and absent does need to be included.
 You know, I get this question all the time.
 Are the meeting minutes a transcript?
 And the answer is no.
 What we know is it doesn't need to be a verbatim transcript of what transpired, particularly as I would imagine you're going to have longer meetings from time to time.
 What the attorney general's office has said and what the open meeting law requires is that it has to have a detailed summary of the discussion of each topic so that a member of the public sitting at home that goes to the website and looks at meeting minutes once they're drafted and approved says, okay, I understand what happened at this meeting, right?
 I understand this was the topic discussed.
 This is the general nature of the discussion.
 These were the votes that were taken.
 Here are the next steps.
 It can't be very cursory, but at the same time, it doesn't need to be a verbatim transcript.
 We do know that it should have the decisions made, any actions taken, and any votes recorded.
 You all did proper roll call vote at the beginning.
 If you are meeting in a remote capacity, you do want to do a roll call vote, and we'll talk about that in a little bit as well.
 The meeting minutes should also reference any documents or other exhibits that you use or consider during a meeting.
 They don't need to be attached to the meeting minutes, but we just want to reference them so that if there is a public records request or a request for those meeting minutes and all materials that you use during the meeting, someone can go back and figure out what was discussed and put the package together to then send to a member of the public.
 Meeting minutes do need to be approved and drafted in a timely manner.
 We know that that requires under the current regulations that that approval has to transpire within the next three meetings or within 30 days, whichever is later.
 There are several determinations that talk about, you know, staffing constraints or operational constraints alone aren't really a good reason for a delay in those approval of the meeting minutes.
 Certainly things happen.
 Everyone's busy and people are doing the best they can.
 My general advice and best practice is to try to stay on top of the drafting and approval of the meeting minutes as best as you can, given your other responsibilities.
 A question has come up very frequently in the last couple of years, can a public body use Google Docs or another document sharing mechanism to edit
 edit the meeting minutes in advance of a meeting to make that a more efficient process.
 And generally that is not allowed under the Open Meeting Law because if several members are going into Google Docs and sharing their comments outside of a public meeting, that could constitute a deliberation.
 It can be delegated, this task, to one individual.
 It's a matter of policy in terms of how you want to handle it in terms of efficiency, but there are different methods, so if you have any questions on that, feel free to let me know, and I'm happy to walk through it.
 Meeting minutes are
 Minutes of open meetings are public records as of the moment of their creation, regardless of whether they've been approved.
 So draft meeting minutes are subject to the public records law, just as approved meeting minutes are.
 Certainly personal notes, so if you take personal notes that are not shared as part of the public body's official files or the school department's files or the city's files, those are personal to you.
 And I would argue those are exempt under the public records law.
 But the meeting minutes, even in draft form, would be subject to disclosure.
 And there is a slightly shorter timeframe for a request for meeting minutes under the open meeting law.
 It's 10 calendar days.
 For a public records request response, it's 10 business days.
 So I just wanted to make sure you had that information as well.
 Executive session minutes.
 I don't know how much you all will meet an executive session, but certainly wanted to make sure everyone was aware of what an executive session is and how those meeting minutes differ from open session meeting minutes.
 The open meeting law allows public bodies to meet an executive or confidential session
 for specific reasons, those are all spelled out in Chapter 30A, Section 21.
 And I have many handouts on this.
 If anyone wants it, feel free to let me know.
 Happy to share it with all of you.
 Basically, if you all meet in executive session, either for litigation or real estate reasons, or there's a particular complaint, those are the most common reasons to go into executive session.
 There are specific requirements that apply.
 There must be notice.
 There need to be roll call votes.
 And those meeting minutes as opposed to the open session meeting minutes are confidential so long as that executive session purpose applies or there may be another reason to keep them confidential even after they're released under the public records law.
 Essentially, executive session meeting minutes can be withheld until that purpose has been met
 unless they're protected under the public records law.
 And the most common example of that is if you were meeting regarding, you know, threatened litigation or litigation that you were involved in, I hope that never happens, under Purpose 3 of the open meeting law, and you had counsel advising you at that meeting, the litigation settles, the, you know, there's no threat of litigation, all of that goes away.
 but the meeting minutes themselves may be able to be redacted under the attorney client privilege.
 So there is a little bit of overlap there with respect to the open meeting law process and the public records process.
 So just want to make sure everyone knew that.
 If you do meet an executive session, the open meeting law requires the chair or the chair's designee to review executive session meeting minutes routinely.
 I usually recommend quarterly just to see, can the meeting minutes be released?
 Has the purpose expired or not?
 And so that, to get in the habit of doing that, if you do end up meeting in executive session, I think is very helpful as things progress.
 Same timeframe in terms of a response, the 10 calendar days as well.
 Not that you need to release them, but just that a response be provided.
 Any questions on that so far?
 Nope, we're good.
 Thank you.
 I just want to check in every once in a while just to make sure.
 Executive sessions, if you do meet an executive session, you're going to first convene an open session.
 This question comes up all the time.
 Well, we're just having an executive session, Janelle.
 Like, what do you mean?
 Well, you have an open session, you start, and then the public sees you vote to go into executive session.
 That's what the open meeting law requires.
 You're going to announce the purpose of the executive session without compromising the reason.
 You know, this comes up more often, I would say, for land use boards, for instance, but if you had, if there was a threat of litigation and you didn't want to impact that at all, certainly may decide as a matter of policy, we can't discuss this.
 So something to be aware of.
 You're going to take and record a roll call to vote to go into executive session.
 and announce publicly whether or not you're going to return an open session or reconvene at all.
 Exhibits and documents are going to, again, be stored in reasonable proximity to the minutes so that we understand what the record of the meeting, what happened at the meeting, what transpired, and really only, I can't stress this enough, discuss the matters that are cited.
 So if you do feel as if you have a reason to go into executive session to discuss things secretly,
 And again, they're very narrow for the reasons you can do this.
 You really only wanna discuss those matters.
 You don't want the conversation of we are in a different direction that should be discussed in open session because I have dealt with open meeting law complaints alleging that when the minutes are released, everyone can see there was an open discussion of something else.
 So really be cognizant that you're only talking about what you can talk about in executive session.
 And again, it's 38 section 21, and the open meeting raw guide that I can circulate after this meeting goes through all of that in detail and there's a very helpful checklist that I have as well that I'm happy to provide to the committee as they conduct as you all conduct your work.
 I do get this question quite often, so I wanted to make sure you all knew.
 If an executive session is anticipated, it does need to be listed in appropriate detail on the meeting notice, again, without compromising your position, and the vote to enter into executive session must also be listed as well.
 You know, it's often that
 You have an open meeting and someone will say, well, can we go into executive session now?
 And the answer is most likely not.
 The same posting requirements apply unless there's an emergency or unanticipated item.
 So I wanted to cover, before we go into questions, and I'm happy to answer any questions that anyone has, a little bit of the enforcement process, just so you're all aware of it in case this ever comes up, and I hope it doesn't.
 You know, step one is if there was an open meeting law complaint that a written complaint be filed, there's a specific form within 30 days that someone found out about the alleged violation.
 And then from there, the public body would review the complaint, discuss a response and issue a response to the complainant along with any action that was taken.
 The complainant can essentially be satisfied and not do anything else and say, I'm completely content.
 with how the committee responded, or alternatively, they can say, I want further review with the Attorney General's Office.
 And the Attorney General's Office has a specific division, the Division of Open Government, that is charged specifically with enforcement of the open meeting law.
 There's a director of that division and several attorneys, and they essentially review open meeting law complaints to determine whether or not a violation has occurred.
 There are a variety of options.
 If there is a violation that the AG's office has, they can nullify the action that's taken.
 There are fines that can be imposed for intentional violations.
 There is also the option to go to court to seek further relief if an individual wants to.
 And then three registered voters can also bring an action in superior court.
 You know, I think the bottom line here is to really take those best practices and try to employ them to the extent you can.
 And if there's any questions along the way, better to ask at the beginning than to let it go further than that.
 Any questions so far?
 Nope.
 Nope, I think we're good.
 Okay, thank you.
 So I wanted to cover some recent notable court decisions.
 I've given a long summary here just so everyone has them.
 I think really the takeaway is the Barron case is a huge case that was recently decided by the SJC, the Supreme Judicial Court, which is the highest state court in the Commonwealth.
 And that really dealt with public comment periods.
 And essentially, in summary, the court held that while
 Municipalities are not required to provide public comments during board and committee meetings.
 If you are required to do so, they have to comply with the provisions of the constitution.
 So after this decision in South Borough, and I encourage you to all read it if you're interested, and I have a copy if anyone wants it, in my opinion, care should really be taken that any public comment period, like we talked about a couple of slides back,
 is limited to these reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions, rather than mandating quote-unquote civility or other content-based restrictions.
 You know, certainly this was a trend since the court reviewed this Corey Spaulding case versus Town of Natick School Committee back in 2018.
 closely tracked that case and the ACLU was involved in that litigation.
 That also dealt with public comments during public meetings where there were allegations the committee improperly limited comments made by members of the public, which were critical of the committee, but allowed other individuals to speak.
 If we look at these cases together, essentially, I think it makes sense to have a public comment policy or consistency across the board with respect to time,
 but regulation of content is really problematic in light of these decisions.
 So if there are specific questions of that, as you begin to conduct your business, certainly let me know.
 I'm happy to analyze that.
 I've worked on a lot of public comment policies since the Barron decision was decided.
 So happy to answer any questions that anyone has on that.
 I think practically speaking, most people do the time restrictions
 for public comment period and decide where in the meeting they're going to have public comment based on their other businesses, business for that meeting.
 I've included reference to two other cases.
 The Town of Swansea case was about sufficiency of meeting minutes.
 So I wanted to make sure you all had that as well.
 And then the Bolter versus Whelan case was really, and I don't know how much this would impact your work, but really dealt with employee evaluation processes.
 The current state of the open meeting law.
 So we know that the COVID-19 pandemic era changes are in place until March 31st, 2025.
 They were extended by Governor Healey in a supplemental budget bill that further extended those temporary measures.
 They were put in place in 2020 and extended several times.
 I just wanted to alert all of you that there is also significant pending legislation that would either seek to extend this further or make modifications to the open meeting law.
 I haven't heard it moving quickly at the state level, but certainly will keep
 All of you updated along the way, if there are changes, we would update, certainly update you, but for now, you can meet entirely in person, you can meet entirely remotely, or you can meet in a hybrid format.
 You know, I think instead of holding meetings in a public place, you can provide adequate alternative means, and we'll talk about what that means.
 Public body members can also participate in meetings remotely as well.
 The changes are still optional,
 There are technological considerations, we'll talk about that, but essentially the 2020 changes that were in place remain in effect through at least March 31st, 2025.
 And I would imagine there'll be further action on those in the next six months.
 Adequate alternative access, what does that mean?
 It means that if you are providing, if you are meeting remotely,
 you have to provide real-time access.
 A lag of about 20 seconds or so is deemed acceptable, but if there is a technical problem that prevents the meeting from being accessible, the stream crashes, the meeting should be paused or rescheduled depending on the severity of the technical issue.
 So there have been multiple determinations that
 The attorney general's office has held that continuing a meeting and posting a recording afterwards does not cure a violation if the meeting is fully remote.
 The public must be able to access the meeting as it happens.
 And again, this is if there's a remote meeting.
 If you're meeting entirely in person and you're providing a courtesy link or it's being live streamed as this is on,
 know Medford community then that requirement would not apply in my opinion.
 Zoom as we're here tonight is the typical means but it's not required.
 Any method that allows the public to follow in real time is acceptable in light of the remote meeting requirements.
 Additional considerations if you are meeting remotely
 you have to make a public statement that the meeting is being recorded, again, under the wiretap requirements.
 Votes should be taken with a roll call, just as we do in an executive session, and remote meeting, remote members, so if there are some people in person and there are some people at home, you must introduce yourselves or be introduced at the meeting, and the camera should be on to the extent that
 someone can have their camera on and they're not participating by phone or for medical reasons, they can't participate with their camera on or they've requested an accommodation.
 When holding an executive session remotely, members of the public body should state that no other person is present, that no one else can hear them.
 Again, that goes to the confidential nature of an executive session.
 And so if we were here tonight, I would say, you know, just so you know, I'm here in a room with the door shut in my office and no one else can hear me.
 That would be sufficient.
 Hybrid meetings.
 Many, I would say the majority of public bodies I work with are meeting in a remote or hybrid manner.
 You can allow
 your members to meet in person, but members of the public can watch a live stream.
 And you can also allow direct participants.
 So if you had a contractor or an engineer or a project manager to attend in person, but the general public could meet remotely.
 And a member may attend remotely if even if other members attend in person.
 The bottom line is essentially if live access stops,
 then the meeting must stop as well.
 If there is troubleshooting or technical difficulties, you do want to be careful, again, not to deliberate over text or email if there is an issue with a technical feed.
 And you can resume the meeting once it's resolved and members of the public are allowed to see the live stream again.
 Public body must be able to hear and follow the meeting from their remote location.
 Okay, so that was a little bit of a, I know a lot of information to take in.
 I'm happy to answer any specific questions that anyone has.
 As I had mentioned, I'm happy to share both these slides as well as additional resources as a open meeting law training kit with all of you and happy to answer any questions along the way.
 and update you with respect to the legislation on the open meeting law changes that may or may not go into effect by the end of next March.

 我是柯蒂斯巴士学校的校长，这可能是最古老的建筑。
 当然。
 我实际上很喜欢老式建筑，喜欢柯蒂斯巴士，但知道它不是为学生设计的。
 因此，我很高兴成为一名高中教师，佛蒙特州的校长，西马萨诸塞州北岸的校长，然后是一所特许学校。
 我总是处于建筑项目的尾声或为之奋斗。
 我是佛蒙特州米德尔伯里的一名学生，目睹了这一切的发生。
 我们都穿着靴子，我的兄弟得到了新大楼的好处。
 我感觉我一直都在最初
 或在某事结束时。
 我认为这真的很令人兴奋。
 我认为，并不是每个城镇都有能力建造新的校舍并思考未来，尤其是与我目前一起工作的学生，在公平、文化资本和资源方面为我们提供机会学生们，我认为这非常重要。
 我喜欢珍妮所说的，有点共同本地化，或者无论是谁提出的，我喜欢这样的想法，认为我们柯蒂斯理工学院的学生确实是这座建筑向前发展的一部分。
 他们应得的。</p>

 所以我想我必须做出调整。
 但我对这意味着什么感到非常兴奋。
 为梅德福建立一所新高中。
 我知道这座建筑建造时，它就像，你知道，可能像泰姬陵。
 那是一所美丽的高中。
 但是，你知道，50 多年后，我们需要一些新的东西。
 我觉得我们的学生应得的。
 我们有精彩的职业规划。
 我们有精彩的学术课程，但在一栋非常古老的建筑中。
 我们确实有一个精彩的柯蒂斯之家项目，该项目位于不同的设施中。
 我们为员工提供精彩的幼儿教育选择和学前班项目。
 我们很幸运在梅德福拥有这些东西。
 我只是觉得梅德福就是一颗小宝石。
 拥有一所新的旗舰高中将为我们的学生、社区以及整个社区、更大社区的未来做出巨大贡献。
 我只是期待成为这个过程的一部分，并与在场的每个人一起工作，并吸取我的不同经历

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=4748.33s">[Graham]</a>:  Sure.
 Thank you all for the...
 words of excitement.
 I want to do a couple of things between now and 8pm and we're going to be out the door at 8, I promise.
 But just as a quick time check, two big things.
 One is I want to give you a bit of a sense of what's been happening.
 to lead up to today and where we are in the process.
 So I'm going to talk a little bit about that.
 We're going to bring up a quick presentation to do that.
 And then before we leave tonight, we will form some subcommittees so that we can move quickly on some of the near-term work that we need to do.
 So we'll talk about that in just a minute.
 But Peter, if you can bring up that presentation for me, that would be great.
 OK.
 You can go ahead a couple of pages.
 Keep going, one more.
 Here we go.
 Back in February, we started, so in December, the MSBA invited us to the eligibility period.
 And we'll talk about what the eligibility period means in just a couple of minutes.
 But that invitation said, you're invited to this process, which starts on May 1st.
 So tomorrow we start.
 However, the committee named me the chair of this building committee back in February, and there's a lot of work that has been done so far.
 One of the things that we had to do was find all of you, right?
 So in the context of trying to say, what is it that we want as a school committee for this building committee to do, we established a list of goals.
 There's going to be many, many more goals, but I did want to set the stage of,
 the work that we're going to do for the next five to seven years.
 The first is to plan comprehensively for all programming currently residing on the Medford High School campus, including vocational and non-vocational 9-to-12 education, 9-to-12 athletics, the Medford Family Network, Medford Community Schools programming, early childhood education, including, but not limited to, the Medford Early Education Program, which we call MEAP, and Kids' Corner.
 So there's so much more that goes on in this building than what we think about when we think about a high school.
 So that's one thing for you all to start to think about.
 Number two, what's that?
 Can I take it?
 Oh yeah, and I can share the slides.
 No, no, I can share the slides.
 Yeah, I can share all the slides with you afterwards.
 Number two is to consider whether the placement of Curtis Tufts High School on the Medford campus will provide increased educational opportunities to enrolled students at Curtis Tufts.
 Number three, ensure robust public input and stakeholder feedback and appropriate milestones throughout the project that complies with MSBA guidelines and guidance from the Medford School Committee.
 Listen to educator and administrator input regarding the future of educational best practices and plans for the students of Medford.
 That means we care a lot about functionality.
 So we wanna know that the spaces will work for the students and the teachers in the building.
 It's really, really important.
 Number five, create plans for the building that advances Medford's climate goals and achieves any CHIPS and LEED 5, LEED version 5 certification to meet the Paris Climate Accords 2030 and 2050 targets, and moves efficiently and effectively through the building process in a manner that ensures students are able to learn in the new building as quickly as is feasible.
 So that's a huge task.
 as quickly as is feasible is still measured in years and not in months.
 But in the context of building this committee, once I was designated the chair, we got out the call for applications, we started to collect applications, and all of you are here.
 Meanwhile, there's a lot of work to do in the eligibility phase that we've already begun.
 So we'll talk about that in just a minute.
 But if you can go to the next slide.
 So this is a
 really junky graphic that did not blow up very well from the SBA website.
 But as we're talking about the entire process, right, we are just outside the box for another like six hours.
 On May 1st, we'll hop inside the box into that eligibility period.
 At each of these steps in the process,
 The MSBA will have to sign off that we have completed all of the requirements of that phase.
 There will have to be a board meeting where they vote to invite us to the next phase.
 So at any point in this process, the MSBA could say, you're not ready to move on.
 They could also say, we don't like what you're doing.
 And they could also say, forget about it.
 So our job here is that none of those things happen.
 Our job is that we are going to play this clean, we are going to be comprehensive, and we are going to move as fast as we humanly can.
 Okay, so we're going to give the MSBA a run for their money because we're going to be ready for them.
 Well, we'll see.
 But that eligibility period lasts for 270 days.
 So by January, we have to be done with the eligibility phase.
 I'm going to talk a little bit about what happens in that phase.
 Beyond the eligibility phase, just briefly, when we talk about forming the project team, that means bringing on board our owner's project manager.
 then we go into the feasibility study.
 When people think about what we're doing on this committee, they think we're doing a feasibility study right now.
 They think we're deciding, are we building?
 Are we renovating?
 Where are we building?
 Is it on the field?
 Is it in the parking lot?
 How's it going to work?
 We are not there yet.
 So please tell all your friends
 We will get there and we will work with professionals to help make those assessments on behalf of what we need to do in this building.
 And then we'll move on to schematic design, funding the projects.
 That is where we vote as a community to fund this project.
 I cannot stress how important that will be, but also we've got a lot of work to do before we get there.
 Once that happens, we go into detailed design, then we put a shovel in the ground, and then at some point in future, we complete the project.
 So that's sort of the soup to nuts.
 My goal is that we're just going to take this one step at a time.
 We're going to do what we need to do to be compliant with the eligibility period, and then we're going to move on.
 As we near that next phase, we're going to start talking about how can we accelerate the work.
 But for right now, our focus is eligibility.
 So if you can flip to the next page.
 The eligibility process is its own graphic, which you cannot see.
 So go ahead and flip to the next slide.
 Okay.
 So there are five things that have to happen in this phase.
 One is the initial compliance certification.
 It's a legal agreement that binds the city to comply with the MSBA's process.
 It has been signed and it has been delivered to the MSBA.
 We are one day ahead of schedule and I'm going to own that.
 Thank you, Mayor and Superintendent.
 We're on our way.
 Number two, the building committee has to be formed.
 You're all here.
 The school committee said meet before May 1st and here we are on April 30th.
 We've done it.
 The form will be submitted to the MSBA shortly.
 So we are working on that and that'll be submitted shortly.
 That's obviously the easy part.
 It's paperwork.
 I think
 The whole eligibility phase is a lot of paperwork, but this is the easy stuff.
 And we're just going to get it done and get it out of the way.
 The MSBA will need to sign off on our committee.
 We have met all the requirements.
 So the MSBA has all kinds of things that it requires of us in terms of who is on this committee.
 We've met all of those requirements with all of you here.
 Now we're going to dive into the actual work.
 There's three additional things that have to happen.
 One is what they call an educational profile.
 It's a template document, and it requires us to say, what happens in this building today?
 How many classrooms?
 How many math classrooms?
 How many swing spaces?
 How big is your theater?
 All of it, right?
 So it asks you to describe currently what happens in this building.
 It also asks you to describe what you envision for the future of this building.
 So this is where those conversations about Curtis Tufts, those conversations about early childhood become very, very important.
 Because between our statement of interest and this eligibility phase, educational profile, that will set the tone for how all the construction professionals actually can do their work.
 So this is going to set the scope, as it were, for the work that has to be done to actually get this building put up.
 So there's a lot of work that's been done right now in this process.
 I have been meeting with the administrative team since February.
 We meet multiple times a week.
 They're very sick of me.
 I would be sick of me.
 But one of the things that we have started to do is say, what can we chip away at?
 And so the document is pretty well drafted when it comes to
 What do we do in this building?
 All the classrooms have been counted.
 All the programs have been outlined.
 There's a little bit more work for the administration to do in terms of what happens today to accurately describe that.
 The other thing that is obviously much more complicated is having some conversation around what will we do in this building in the future?
 So in that conversation, again, we've been having a lot of sort of broad conversation.
 We've been sort of tapping into like the strategic planning parts of our brain to ask big questions, and I'm going to use Curtis Tufts just for a quick minute.
 We have had some discussion about do our educators think that is something that we should be thinking about and the answer to that is yes, they said, yes, we should be thinking about that.
 And so we started to say okay what does that look like what might.
 the requirements be.
 So we've started that conversation, but that conversation is bigger than what this committee can sort of chew on because it sort of dabbles in responsibilities of the school committee.
 So last night I served up a resolution asking our special education and behavioral health subcommittee, which is actually chaired by member Rousseau, to have a meeting on a very tight timeline to collect input and feedback
 about that very narrow topic.
 Would co-location of the Curtis-Tufts onto this campus in some capacity be beneficial to the educational outcomes of the students that go to Curtis-Tufts?
 There is another Medford resident who actually spoke last night.
 He is in charge of a very comparable program at Somerville.
 He talked about this transition just happening in Somerville and how it exploded his population.
 It has changed the game for the students who need that alternative setting in terms of access to things like sports teams, in our case, the vocational programs.
 So there's huge, huge opportunity, but
 We want to make sure that the community and the committee have some opportunity to sort of think about all that that might bring to the table and provide a recommendation back to this committee.
 So that has been turfed.
 Last night, officially, to the Special Education Subcommittee, they will meet.
 They will invite current staff, current students, former students,
 community members, etc, etc.
 And Jack Hevery from Somerville to come and talk and work through that and provide a recommendation.
 So they're on their way, that will come back by mid-June.
 So they have their work cut out for them, but that will help us inform
 the drafting of that piece of what we envisioned for this school.
 Because what we likely will need is not just a couple of classrooms somewhere in the building.
 Part of why the Curtis Tufts is successful is because the environment is considerably different than this very, very big campus with 1,200 students.
 So we will have to think carefully about how we craft that.
 But hopefully, the work that the subcommittee does will come back to us and can be sort of funneled in.
 Marta and Chad will come to a future school committee meeting in the coming weeks and Marta will be talking about some of her ideas for alternative programming and what all that might look like even in the short term.
 And so that is something that will have to be sort of folded in.
 Joan and Suzanne and I and Paul had a conversation yesterday about early education.
 Our elementary schools are busting at the seams.
 We'll have to grapple with that problem sometime.
 MEEP used to be housed here.
 And we are going to explore a case that says MEAP should come back here.
 And that may or may not be ultimately where we land, but that is something that we're exploring because now is the time.
 We also talked a lot about
 students who don't have any sort of pre-k education, and as they enter our public schools, just how challenging the entry for those students are.
 And so we are also talking about things like how big is the wait list, and how many students come to us who have never been in some sort of pre-k setting, and what kind of capacity would we need to service a bigger, more comprehensive early education program out of this building, because all of that would need to go into this document.
 So we are working on that.
 So as these things are happening, there's been a lot of work to date on this educational profile.
 The one big piece of educational profile we haven't touched yet is the communication strategy.
 I'll talk about that in just a minute.
 But on the education side, there's so much that our educators have to do for us to be able to get that document pulled together.
 I just want you all to know it's all in process and as we go through our next several meetings we'll bring those documents forward so we can start to do like broader reading of those documents, ask for suggestions, make sure that we are really thinking about all the angles of what we need to describe and so that is where I think all of you play a really important role to say
 I think you need to describe what we're doing here a little bit differently based on what I know or based on sort of what the vision is for the arts programs or for the vocational programs, et cetera, et cetera.
 So that's where we are on the educational profile.
 Curtis Tuft's co-location is in subcommittee.
 The other big sort of newer, newish, changing topic is MEEP.
 What MSBA describes as the reason for delay often in communities is that they're having to make very big decisions that feed their building process.
 Like, do we combine two schools?
 And so that obviously has its own energy and its own set of requirements, which makes it very challenging to be able to move quickly.
 So we are trying to both think very big because this is
 a one-shot opportunity to think about what the district really does need in a very comprehensive way, but also move as fast as possible.
 So all that work has been in progress and moving as quickly as is humanly possible.
 Peter, can you go to the next slide?
 Very similarly on the vocational side, because we have a very active vocational school, we have another document that needs to be filled out, which is a Chapter 74 viability.
 Chapter 74 is the chapter of the regulation that establishes vocational programs, right?
 OK.
 That drafting is in progress.
 We have to tell them, here are the programs we have.
 Here is the capacity of those programs.
 Here is our current enrollment.
 And things like, what is our wait list?
 We also have an opportunity to describe intended expansion of these programs.
 Chad and Peter will be at the school committee talking about potential for expansion.
 That is a school committee matter because expanded program takes much more than just a building.
 It takes equipment, it takes staffing.
 So the school committee has to weigh in on that.
 So that's gonna come before the school committee on May 20th, and that will feed sort of the finalization of
 the chapter 70 form and and this group will read through and sort of get ready for that as well.
 Um, and then there is a piece, um, of the puzzle, which, um, the mayor and the superintendent and I are talking to MSBA about later this week, which is really information around city planning.
 So we can start to, um, feed information into what they call their enrollment study that helps size the building.
 So you've probably heard a lot about this building was built for 4,000 students, and now there's only 1200 that.
 Whether 4,000 was the number or not, I don't know, but it is true that the number is different.
 And so one of the things that the MSBA will do in the eligibility phase is they will say, we're going to build a building for this many students.
 That usually tracks with something like what happens in the building today.
 However, if there's huge planned expansion in the city in terms of housing units going up for development, they're going to want to know all of that.
 So that they can size the building because they don't want us to build a building that is immediately out of capacity.
 They also don't want us to build a building that will never be at capacity, right so so that's some of the work that's happening there.
 Fourth thing, maintenance documents.
 There's a questionnaire that we have to answer that outlines all of our maintenance practices across the district.
 So it's things like, do you do recommissioning?
 And how is your staff trained?
 There's like 20 variables.
 That document is also in draft and moving along as quickly as is humanly possible.
 We'll get to that probably a little bit later in June.
 Final thing that we need to do to be considered done with eligibility is we have to identify funding for the feasibility study, which is probably somewhere in the neighborhood of two and a quarter to two and a half million dollars.
 We're not ready for that yet, but we're making plans.
 The mayor and I are working on what will that plan be from a financial task force perspective, so that that money can be accounted for and cared for as quickly as it is required to be.
 questions about the process.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5920.302s">[Preisner]</a>: 当然。
 那么当它说地方授权时，是否意味着选民不投票呢？
 不。
 或者说它是否意味着
 有钱了。
 市政府已确定资金。
 正确的。
 全额报销，部分报销。
 但我认为授权必须是全额。
 正确的。
 FDA 将根据我们的报销范围告诉您报销内容。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=5944.979s">[Graham]</a>: 正确的。
 因此，就可行性而言，这笔资金必须涵盖可行性研究的全部费用。
 不是整个项目，只是可行性研究，大约 2 到 250 万美元。
 该市将预先支付整个可行性研究的费用。
 然后，一旦 MSBA 认证了我们的项目报销率，并且我们一直成功，他们将报销与他们向我们提供的分配百分比相称的可行性研究费用。
 所以是的，是的。
 他们将使用相同的公式并应用于可行性研究并向城市回扣。
 但市政府必须先支付这笔钱。
 所以这里必须发生的是
 我们必须这样做。
 如果我们需要出去选举选民来获得这笔钱，我们就必须这样做。
 我们预计不需要这样做。
 我们已经为此制定了融资计划，我们应该做得很好。
 所以我们在那里没问题，这需要市议会投票来授权这些资金并将其放在我们可以使用的地方。
 但我们在那里状况良好。
 正如我提到的，所有这些都必须在一月份之前完成。
 每个都有与其相关的特定截止日期。
 我会非常积极地告诉你们，我希望所有这些事情都能在明年开学之前完成。
 只要有可能，我希望这些事情能够在 6 月 30 日之前完成。
 嗯，这就是我们一直在会面、工作和推动的原因。
 嗯，我认为，嗯，伸展运动对我们来说很重要。
 所以，让我们舒展筋骨，做好准备。
 嗯，MSBA 将有他们的工作要做，嗯，获得入学研究认证等等，但我希望我们能够为他们提供他们需要的一切，以便我们能够行动尽快进入下一阶段。
 关于时间线的问题。
 好的。
 所以我们只剩下20分钟了。
 为此，我们在议程后面列出了一些即将召开的小组委员会会议。
 我希望我们在处理问题时考虑并优先考虑两件事
 进入第一阶段。
 其中一个是沟通和社区参与委员会。
 我想要一个小组委员会，其投票成员不超过七名，但有一个感兴趣的小组在小组委员会中会面，以便真正能够描述和概述我们的社区参与流程。
 我想你们都看到社区里的人们表达了他们的担忧，梅德福会搞砸这件事吗？
 它会起作用吗？
 它会发生吗？
 因此，必须进行大规模的社区推广。
 我们越早开始，最终就会越成功。
 不过，我认为这是一次更大的对话，因为在我看来，我们有
 大量的董事会和委员会。
 他们中的许多人对这个项目感兴趣。
 因此，需要进行一些外展活动，以了解何时以及如何让他们参与进来，以便我们能够将其纳入我们前进的总体规划中。
 今晚我想组建的第二个小组是规则和入职委员会。
 因此，就像您从珍妮尔那里听到的那样，我们确实必须制定一些运作方式的规则，特别是围绕公众参与，但只是一般性的。
 我预计该委员会的时间是有限的。
 我希望你们能见面一次，将草案带回这个小组，然后我们可以采用这些规则并从那里进行管理。
 然后第三个委员会不会那么快开会，但会开会，
 6月底之前是财务分委会。
 因此，这将是一个常设委员会，将在项目的整个生命周期中召开会议并持续下去。
 值得注意的是，当社区必须投票时，
 该委员会不是开展这项工作的地方。
 因此，如果我们谈论的是最终需要债务排除以便为该项目提供资金，那么这个委员会并不是让我们通过债务排除发生的地方。
 这实际上不可能发生在这里。
 它必须发生在这个群体之外。
 嗯，所以这个财务委员会，我认为这更多，嗯，提供输入，嗯，以及对采购、采购、嗯、我们业主的项目经理、嗯、我们建筑师的事情的洞察力，这类事情，嗯，还可以帮助告知我们需要对可行性进行哪些微调？
 我们还需要考虑其他成本吗？
 所以，还有一些财务工作要做，尽管，嗯，
 你知道，我预计该小组要到五月晚些时候才会开会。
 因此，我们将在下次会议上更多地讨论罗伯特议事规则等所有内容。
 我知道，每个人都像看着我一样，请停止说话。
 8 点了。
 所以我认为我感兴趣的是，如果有人听到这些话题并说，我真的想成为其中的一部分
 作为这些小组委员会的一员，您能透露一下自己的身份吗？
 我还礼貌地建议学校管理人员不要干涉，因为您有自己的工作要做，为我们刚才描述的所有其余内容做好准备。
 所以我们百分百欢迎您加入。
 参加，但我们需要您在学校委员会上发言。
 我们需要约翰和彼得帮助制定这些维护计划等等。
 因此，如果有人对任何其他主题感兴趣，委员会的规模不能太大，但可以是我们认为完成工作所需的任何规模。
 因此，我将这些小组委员会列入了日历。
 我们将在那些晚上完全通过 Zoom 见面，只是为了让事情变得更容易一些。
 但是，您知道，在 5 月 13 日的下一次会议上，每个人都会有一个非常具体的交付成果，即带回一份他们的提案草案。
 有志愿者吗？
 是的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6321.323s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 对于另外两个。
 指定多少？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6325.707s">[Graham]</a>: 我认为可以是任意数量的人。
 有投票权的成员不得超过七名。
 但我认为，如果我们真的把所有学校工作人员都排除在外，我并不太担心我们会因此而绊倒。
 但我更感兴趣的是人们做他们认为适合他们正在做的工作、适合他们热爱的工作的事情。
 谢谢。
 玛丽亚.
 通讯。
 谢谢。
 特雷西。
 规则。
 好的。
 通讯。
 玛丽莎。
 惊人的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6367.334s">[Libby Brown]</a>: 我的意思是，我可以放两个，看看是否有足够的通信或财务。
 好的。
 好的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6374.859s">[Graham]</a>: 我会让你从事金融工作。
 听起来怎么样？
 听起来不错。
 好的。
 我听到什么了吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6381.976s">[Galusi]</a>: 好的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6385.438s">[Graham]</a>: 还有菲奥娜，金融。
 我们也可以和鲍勃签约从事金融工作吗？
 伟大的。
 是的，是的，绝对是的。
 这些委员会还有其他接受者吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6402.244s">[Preisner]</a>: 如果你没有获得足够的资金。
 好吧，我要把你列入名单。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6412.739s">[Graham]</a>: 有两个人负责规则和入职。
 这是正确的。
 我原本计划担任所有委员会的成员，但也许我们可以要求艾米丽·拉扎罗 (Emily Lazzaro) 加入规则和入职小组委员会。
 嗯，所以我会与她核实，但是，嗯，我也让妮可·莫雷尔加入了沟通小组委员会。
 所以，嗯，我们会和他们核实一下，但是还有其他人有强烈的感觉吗？或者你想去吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6447.185s">[Olapade]</a>: 好的，太好了。
 嗯，我本来想说金融，但我在这方面绝对没有那么多经验。
 好的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6455.601s">[Graham]</a>: 我想我们很好。
 约翰？
 不，你还有工作要做。
 哦，绝对是。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6461.327s">[Parkinson]</a>: 我认为对于团队中所有实际的技术人员来说，</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6470.157s">[Graham]</a>: 在我们深入讨论之前，将会有一个工作组为业主的项目经理整理一份 RFP。
 这不是我所拥有的专业知识。
 这不是我来这里的原因。
 因此，随着时间的推移，我们将依靠每个人组成不同的小组委员会。
 这只是我认为我们应该从近处开始的观点。
 这有道理吗？
 对于即将发生的事情，有人有任何其他建议吗？
 我有一个问题。
 当然。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6499.089s">[Larry Brown]</a>: 你提到柯蒂斯可能会来这里以及该设施的所有这些不同用途。
 谁正在探索这些选项，即
 比如社区教育，比如在社区大学工作，晚上的课程，就像我在那里希望与 AGC 总承包商协会合作，他们正在做成人教育。
 有没有人像，
 把一堆你们喜欢考虑的选项摆在桌面上，怎么样？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6534.345s">[Graham]</a>: 是的，有点不，但也不完全是。
 我们还没有完全做到这一点。
 所以我认为，一旦我们完成了第 74 章的最初的脸红，我们就可以将其添加进去。
 因此，当我们开始阅读这些文件时，我认为这是一个好时机，我们还需要联系谁？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6554.235s">[Larry Brown]</a>: 因为所有这些东西都会影响
 交通便利性、邻近性、设施相对其他设施的规模、存储、停车位，你知道的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6563.741s">[Graham]</a>: 好吧，是的，我认为这是个好主意。
 我要把它列在清单上。
 是的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6568.884s">[Ruseau]</a>: 事实上，我们受到城市的限制。
 我们是。
 如果房间里的每个人都喜欢，联邦 Rec 应该在这里。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6577.15s">[Parkinson]</a>: 它不在城市里。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6585.563s">[Graham]</a>: 但社区学校是。
 所以是的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6595.083s">[Preisner]</a>: 好的。
 是的，所以我想问，谁将为该委员会提供任何形式的数字基础设施资源？
 所以我会参考 SOI。
 有SOI。
 有一些调查支持了 SOI。
 可能还有一整套其他公开文件实际上无法公开访问，但应该可以公开。
 你知道，这个通信社区参与小组委员会将承担以下责任：
 可能向很多人传达同样的事情。
 是的，这是通过网站最有效地完成的，也许是通过共享存储库，当然可能有一个面向外的
 你知道，门户就像一个网站，就像每所学校都有这些项目之一，然后是一个后端存储库，谢尔顿可以在其中查看为什么，例如，它可以随时向会员开放，或者，你知道，有点在访问列表上。
 当然。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6657.678s">[Graham]</a>: 我可以给你更新情况。
 我们得到了这个。
 因此，我们实际上获得了该委员会独有的 URL，它是buildingMHS.org。
 是这样吗？
 好的。
 所以这个网址是存在的。
 该页面存在。
 托马斯实际上正在研究该社区资源的骨架。
 我们要求大家提供简历和图片的原因是这些都会出现在网站上，所以他正在以传播总监的身份完成所有这些工作。
 汤姆已同意，尽管他是即将卸任的传播总监，但他仍同意继续专门从事该项目，直到我们聘请他的继任者。
 所以这个网站是由托马斯和我们的一些职业学生共同建立的，我假设是在丽莎·米勒的领导下。
 并且将有一个文件组件，所有这些可公开访问的文件都将放在其中，以便当有人说，这是在哪里？
 我们可以将他们指向一个地方。
 我们所有的会议纪要都会放在那里。
 我们所有的会议议程都会在那里。
 因此，我们已经建立了一个完整的结构来尝试做到这一点。
 我们还没有完全准备好，但我希望到下次会议时，我们能够参观我们的论坛。
 那个网站。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6731.704s">[Preisner]</a>: 好的。
 嗯，接下来就是向外的门户。
 我们的后端怎么样？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6738.866s">[Graham]</a>: 所以这是一个棘手的问题，因为根据公开会议法，我们确实没有后端。
 一旦议程发布，其所有文件都将成为公共记录的一部分。
 如果是的话，棘手的是如果我们在幕后处理事情，我们很可能违反公开会议法。
 因此，管理员拥有他们正在处理的文档的工作副本，并且他们不代表法定人数，他们可以继续这样做。
 一旦这些文档到达这里，它们将被放置在公开可用的驱动器中。
 当我们谈论编辑文档时，这个委员会不存在离线编辑。
 公开会议法不允许这样做。
 所以不幸的是，我们将痛苦地坐在这里，共同编辑一个文档。
 这确实是管理这个过程中最痛苦的部分之一，你们都已经签署了。
 对不起。
 但是，是的，这是非常痛苦的，但是离线，那种在世界上几乎所有其他地方都非常有效的离线编辑在这里不是一种选择。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6811.109s">[Preisner]</a>: 好吧，所以没有 Google Drive，没有共享文档，东西都会被发布。
 当它们被发布时，它们会出现在网站上。
 当它们出现在网站上时，它们本质上是配置控制，并且不能更改，除非这些更改在这里反向进行。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6826.757s">[Graham]</a>: 正确的。
 是的。
 这绝对是可怕的。
 我们已经找到了让它不那么可怕的方法，但遗憾的是，它的可怕程度已经减轻了。
 就文档的编辑方式而言，这肯定会让您与社区陷入困境。
 所以，当我们这样做时，我发现这些会议在 Zoom 上要有效得多。
 您可以坐在您需要坐的地方，每个人都可以观看文档的编辑过程，并且如果不公开进行编辑，就不可能知道文档正在被编辑。
 所以我们必须非常谨慎地对待这一点。
 但是，是的，这是一个过程。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6903.643s">[Parkinson]</a>: 完全错误的政策，40名成员。
 一位成员说，西蒙，只要确保你在后面，然后在那里写下我们的评论并将它们放在一起即可。
 答案是否定的。
 所以你确实输入了你的评论，回复了你的，他们就像，好吧，承认了。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6926.232s">[Galusi]</a>: 是的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6926.472s">[Parkinson]</a>: 只是，我们很抱歉。
 这就像，我们同意这可能是最大的</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6933.462s">[Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 是的。
 再次感谢您来到这里。
 我对通讯部分也很感兴趣，虽然工作很愉快，但我很高兴总是接听一些电话。
 他们会回到这里。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6948.428s">[Graham]</a>: 所有这些更新都会回到这里。
 我可以回答有关小组委员会或议程上的其他任何问题吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6958.671s">[King]</a>: 我有一个问题。
 我有一个关于投票的问题。
 是的，当我们开始投票时。
 是的，我们不是。
 我从来没有理解过的一件事是允许代理。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6972.628s">[Graham]</a>: 不。
 不，事实并非如此。
 会议中是否允许代理人参加？
 不，您不能将您的选票分配给其他人。
 当我们休会时，我们将练习投票，因为我们必须投票来休会。
 一般来说，这会通过他们所谓的语音投票来实现，每个人都说“是”，然后我们就走。
 我们只是要练习点名，因为
 再次，奇怪和尴尬。
 因此，我们将这样做以推迟会议。
 但在我们休会之前还有其他问题吗？
 他正在注意。
 但我认为另一件事值得描述的是，该委员会中有大量无投票权的成员。
 这样做的原因并不是因为我们不想收到您的来信。
 您来到这里是因为我们想收到您的来信。
 投票时，我们不会叫出您的名字，您也不会投票。
 但除此之外，你还是这个委员会的正式成员。
 我被警告说
 当你有太多投票成员时，开展业务就会变得非常困难，因为你必须达到委员会的法定人数才能开会和开展业务。
 这一切都变得非常非常复杂。
 所以这就是我们试图说的，我们想要一个大型的圆形委员会，但我们也需要能够高效、有效地行动以及所有这些东西。
 这就是背后的基本原理。
 我们在那里做了什么。
 而且，你知道，我认为，你知道，这个委员会的规模肯定会在其生命周期中发生变化。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7068.989s">[King]</a>: 那么25个呢？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7070.309s">[Graham]</a>: 是的，委员会有15名投票成员，这也是一个相当不错的投票成员数量。
 我们很快就会练习投票。
 但下次会议还有其他问题吗？
 规则、规则和入职时间为 5 月 7 日，社区参与时间为 5 月 8 日，他们将于 5 月 13 日将调查结果带回该小组。
 因此，我们 5 月 13 日会议的绝大多数内容将讨论这些建议，就这些计划达成一致。
 同样，我们又处于启动模式。
 之后，我们将深入了解政府一直在处理的一些文件的实质内容并开始
 通读这些文件，谈论其中的内容和类似的事情。
 但我们会快速行动。
 我们确实通过一些基本原理的方式列出了会议日程。
 我们将尽可能亲自在 Bishop 489 会面，以便
 从现在到六月底。
 我向你保证，下学年开始时我们会回到周一晚上。
 但从现在到六月底，在学校委员会会议和假期之间，实际上完全不可能保持这样的时间表。
 我们只会在夏天通过 Zoom 开会，实际上，我们将会议移至星期三，因为夏天的星期一和星期五很难找到一个让任何人做任何事情的论坛。
 所以希望我们能够做到这一点，但我确实努力保持会议日程轻松。
 我认为从现在到八月底将会有更多的小组委员会，但这只是一个开始，以便人们可以尝试组织他们忙碌的生活。
 是的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7178.606s">[Parkinson]</a>: 但这是一个代理问题。
 如果你做不到的话。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7183.63s">[Bowen]</a>: 没关系。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7184.27s">[Parkinson]</a>: 发送您的同时也发送一封包含您所有想法和评论的电子邮件。
 主席，你的声音消失了。
 所以，嗯，</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7205.75s">[Preisner]</a>: 其实，这是一个技术问题。
 因此，一位绅士无法让会议向您发送一封电子邮件，表明他的想法和建议，甚至可能是一个决定。
 早些时候我们听说，除了议程设置之外，电子邮件对于几乎所有事情都是一个坏主意。
 所以这听起来像是一个灰色地带。
 我想知道，所以你知道公开会议法，而这两件事是冲突的。
 它是如何运作的？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7232.16s">[Graham]</a>: 所以我可以告诉你，我认为任何律师都会告诉你永远不要以书面形式写下任何内容，对吧？
 这就是我们开始的地方。
 永远不要把任何东西写下来。
 话虽如此，如果你打算把一些东西写下来，在这种情况下，是的，这是一个灰色地带。
 你应该做的是与某人联系并说，嘿，我可以向你发送我的想法吗？
 您是否与其他人讨论过这些事情或者您打算这样做吗？
 因此，如果您可以相当确定自己已经建立了闭合电路，对吗？
 你对我说，我可以向你发送我的想法吗？
 我说，是的。
 我说，我不会和其他任何人谈论这些事情，然后我们就可以了。
 只有当你与代表委员会多数投票权的一些人建立联系时，这才会成为问题。
 例如，如果您说，我想告诉两个人，因为我不确定谁会真正参加会议，那仍然可以，因为您的人数不足八人。
 当你与自己（包括你自己）和八个人交谈后，你就有麻烦了。
 那就是你违反了公开会议法。
 棘手的部分是每个参与者都必须对谁参与了该对话有相同的理解。
 我错过了什么？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7312.233s">[Parkinson]</a>: 你可以非常有意。
 我只是告诉你，你就说，嗯。
 然后你去做同样的事情。
 无论我们采取什么措施来捍卫法律，我们都在违反法律。
 所以我认为划清界限非常有趣。
 就是连环议论什么都不关心。
 它不是内容、计划或保险。
 只有我们两个人，对吧？
 是的。
 你去违反这一点。
 我触犯了法律。
 即使我不知道。
 对，对。
 嗯，是的，那很好。
 我们决定了吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7350.203s">[Graham]</a>: 我们将为每个人提供一个梅德福公立学校下的电子邮件地址。
 我强烈建议您在任何情况下都不要将您的个人电子邮件用于与 MSBA 相关的任何业务。
 因此，一旦这些电子邮件设置完毕，我们就会转换所有内容。
 但我强烈建议您不要将您的个人电子邮件用于任何用途。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7369.017s">[Parkinson]</a>: 它使公共记录合规性变得更加可怕。
 我是学区的记录查阅官员。
 除了您的个人笔记之外，在官方商学院完成的任何文件都自动成为公共记录，需要可提供或至少可在有人要求时进行审查。
 因此，在您的梅德福公立学校电子邮件地址、您的梅德福公立学校 Google 套件中完成这一切，您可以在其中做笔记和类似的事情，将所有内容都包含在该空间中确实很有帮助。
 最后还有什么问题吗？
 现在是 8.03。
 我们只是想按照罗伯特的规则推迟这次会议。
 有休会动议吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=7429.79s">[Graham]</a>: 奥拉帕德议员提议休会，鲁索议员附议。
 谢谢。
 哦，你不能。
