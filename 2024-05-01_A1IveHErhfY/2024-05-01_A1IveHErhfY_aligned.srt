1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:01,550
The drinks are over there.

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:02,210
One minute.

3
00:00:32,481 --> 00:00:41,647
There's a little bit of overlap, but I can I can hear usually one person at a time.

4
00:01:00,765 --> 00:01:01,065
Perfect.

5
00:01:01,085 --> 00:01:02,666
The gang's all here.

6
00:01:02,786 --> 00:01:05,148
And I think Chad is the only other person.

7
00:01:29,738 --> 00:01:30,198
We'll be back.

8
00:01:59,645 --> 00:02:01,286
We're each other like an hour.

9
00:02:18,795 --> 00:02:20,556
Suzanne, do you know Luke?

10
00:02:20,636 --> 00:02:21,397
I don't think I do.

11
00:02:49,352 --> 00:02:53,553
I'd like to see wheels.

12
00:02:53,613 --> 00:02:57,695
My, I don't think I've seen one.

13
00:02:57,875 --> 00:02:58,835
Okay.

14
00:02:59,075 --> 00:03:00,716
Good evening.

15
00:03:00,956 --> 00:03:02,896
We're setting up today.

16
00:03:03,077 --> 00:03:06,158
Our Zoom will have a much more functional Zoom room in the future.

17
00:03:06,518 --> 00:03:07,998
We're just waiting for our vendor to come.

18
00:03:08,358 --> 00:03:10,659
The microphone is in the center there.

19
00:03:10,679 --> 00:03:12,580
It's completely wireless.

20
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,481
So we need to move it as necessary, but it also serves as a speaker.

21
00:03:17,419 --> 00:03:20,340
So if I have to unplug some stuff, I will do that.

22
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:25,301
If there's too much noise, just let me know.

23
00:03:25,441 --> 00:03:27,622
Do we have people in the waiting room on Zoom?

24
00:03:27,842 --> 00:03:31,663
The waiting room is open, so people are free to come in at any time.

25
00:03:32,103 --> 00:03:36,864
And if we see anybody, we'll just send you a code.

26
00:03:37,265 --> 00:03:37,905
OK, great.

27
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:38,585
Thank you.

28
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,420
Welcome, everybody.

29
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,221
We're here.

30
00:03:41,701 --> 00:03:42,381
We made it.

31
00:03:44,222 --> 00:03:45,443
That's actually really exciting.

32
00:03:47,683 --> 00:03:48,724
Thank you all for coming.

33
00:03:49,644 --> 00:03:53,426
Just by way of some plans for tonight, we're going to leave at 8.

34
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:54,846
We're going to leave sooner than 8.

35
00:03:56,647 --> 00:04:03,110
The first thing, I'm going to shift the agenda around a little bit because Janelle from KP Law is here to do some open meeting law training.

36
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,331
So we're going to skip introductions for the moment.

37
00:04:06,831 --> 00:04:12,173
so that Janelle can do open meeting while training because she has a commitment for the second half of this meeting.

38
00:04:12,193 --> 00:04:14,793
So I wanted to make sure there's enough time for her to get that in.

39
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:18,794
But before we do that, I'm just gonna do a quick roll call so that we, for the record, know who's here.

40
00:04:20,795 --> 00:04:21,815
Jenny Graham here.

41
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:23,196
Mayor Lugo-Kern.

42
00:04:23,276 --> 00:04:23,476
Here.

43
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:24,956
Dr. Edwarda Benson.

44
00:04:25,216 --> 00:04:25,436
Here.

45
00:04:25,876 --> 00:04:26,717
Dr. Galluzzi.

46
00:04:27,077 --> 00:04:27,297
Here.

47
00:04:28,037 --> 00:04:28,757
Dr. Cushing.

48
00:04:28,997 --> 00:04:29,237
Here.

49
00:04:29,257 --> 00:04:30,758
Moderator Cabral.

50
00:04:30,898 --> 00:04:31,098
Here.

51
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:32,058
Lady Brown.

52
00:04:32,258 --> 00:04:32,378
Here.

53
00:04:32,836 --> 00:04:37,659
Marissa Desmond, Maria Dorsey, Brian Hilliard, he is absent.

54
00:04:38,119 --> 00:04:41,161
Tracy Keene, Emily Lazaro is absent.

55
00:04:41,221 --> 00:04:42,482
She has a council meeting tonight.

56
00:04:42,862 --> 00:04:44,323
Nicole Morrell is absent.

57
00:04:44,423 --> 00:04:45,783
She had a prior conflict.

58
00:04:46,624 --> 00:04:53,788
Aaron Lopate, Luke Preissner, Larry Brown, Bob Dickinson, he is not here this evening.

59
00:04:54,268 --> 00:04:56,550
Fiona Maxwell, Joan Bowen,

60
00:04:57,489 --> 00:05:01,150
Thomas Dalton, Chad Fallon is incoming, I believe.

61
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:08,553
Lori Hodgkin, John McLaughlin, Paul Rousseau, and Philip Santos is not present tonight.

62
00:05:08,633 --> 00:05:09,653
He had a conference as well.

63
00:05:10,753 --> 00:05:12,054
So we have a quorum.

64
00:05:12,254 --> 00:05:15,615
You're gonna learn why that's important in just a few minutes.

65
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:18,916
But I'm gonna turn it over to Janelle in just a second.

66
00:05:19,936 --> 00:05:25,158
But I think I'll start by saying all of our meetings are subject to the open meeting law.

67
00:05:25,898 --> 00:05:31,680
And with four years of experience in the open meeting lot, it's a very clunky way to get work done.

68
00:05:32,281 --> 00:05:35,962
So I'm just going to say that that's my personal experience.

69
00:05:36,242 --> 00:05:37,343
It's there for a reason.

70
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:50,388
It's absolutely necessary, but it will require all of you to think carefully about not only what you're saying and doing in the meetings, but more importantly, how you're behaving outside of our meetings because

71
00:05:51,028 --> 00:05:56,714
you can sort of inadvertently find yourself in conflict with the open meeting law.

72
00:05:56,735 --> 00:06:08,427
MSB requires that we hold all of our meetings in accordance with the open meeting law, so we thought it was important for everybody to have some sort of grounding in all of that.

73
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:15,650
Um the elected officials in the room obviously are familiar with the open meeting law and can provide guidance to anybody who has questions.

74
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:16,850
I've just signed them up for that.

75
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:29,593
Um I would say to the educators in the room like you generally interact with the school committee all the time and you are generally not subject to the open meeting law but in this room and on this topic you are.

76
00:06:29,613 --> 00:06:32,874
So it's um just sort of a tuning of

77
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:37,017
your set of responsibilities in this way.

78
00:06:37,037 --> 00:06:38,558
So I'm going to turn it over to Janelle.

79
00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:45,423
Janelle, if you could kindly let us know whether you want questions along the way or you want us to hold our questions until you're done.

80
00:06:45,964 --> 00:06:46,404
Sure.

81
00:06:46,564 --> 00:06:47,325
Thank you so much.

82
00:06:47,425 --> 00:06:48,666
Can everyone hear me okay?

83
00:06:48,886 --> 00:06:49,166
Yes.

84
00:06:49,926 --> 00:06:52,628
Thank you so much for having me this evening.

85
00:06:52,729 --> 00:06:57,152
Happy to present on this very important topic of the open meeting law.

86
00:06:57,714 --> 00:07:02,858
I will dive into the public records law a little bit to the extent there's a little bit of overlap.

87
00:07:02,918 --> 00:07:06,040
I always think it's a good idea to cover these topics.

88
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,343
Certainly I agree in terms of open meeting law compliance.

89
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:18,628
I represent the city of Medford, other communities across the state, and we are seeing a significant uptick in open meeting law compliance.

90
00:07:19,529 --> 00:07:24,092
So certainly a good opportunity to provide best practices, talk a little bit in terms of

91
00:07:24,548 --> 00:07:35,732
you know, what your role is in terms of open meeting law compliance, and I understand that some members may be more familiar than others, so I'll try to start with best practices, and I think that's always a good idea.

92
00:07:35,752 --> 00:07:38,773
If there are certainly any questions after the training,

93
00:07:39,786 --> 00:07:43,610
or along the way, I think we can feel free to interject.

94
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:48,233
I'm an informal person, as many of you know, happy to have this be a conversation.

95
00:07:49,214 --> 00:07:55,079
If someone feels more comfortable speaking to me after the training, I'm certainly happy to make myself available as well.

96
00:07:55,619 --> 00:07:58,922
And the mayor has my contact information, happy to provide that.

97
00:07:59,451 --> 00:08:02,915
I would also start by saying certification is really important.

98
00:08:02,995 --> 00:08:10,064
So for any member that hasn't already completed their open meeting law certification, I recommend that be done as soon as possible.

99
00:08:11,025 --> 00:08:16,111
The new Attorney General has put forth a new updated open meeting law guide.

100
00:08:16,661 --> 00:08:17,281
last year.

101
00:08:17,341 --> 00:08:21,044
That's available on the Division of Open Government's website.

102
00:08:21,104 --> 00:08:34,533
I'm happy to circulate the link after this, but in my opinion, if any members are due for their open meeting law certification or for any new members, it's a good idea and certainly required under the open meeting law that that be conducted.

103
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:39,376
We are going to cover best practices tonight where this is a public meeting.

104
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:46,000
I don't want to go into any specifics or anything that may invoke the open meeting law in a non-confidential way.

105
00:08:46,471 --> 00:08:49,712
Certainly if there are any questions, happy to follow up afterwards.

106
00:08:50,592 --> 00:08:52,413
I think I have the ability to share my screen.

107
00:08:52,453 --> 00:08:55,854
So I wanted to go through the slides that I have.

108
00:08:55,974 --> 00:09:00,975
And again, if anyone has any particular questions, happy to either interject.

109
00:09:01,155 --> 00:09:03,456
I won't take offense or go from there.

110
00:09:03,496 --> 00:09:04,997
Can everyone see the slides okay?

111
00:09:06,497 --> 00:09:06,757
Great.

112
00:09:08,058 --> 00:09:10,458
So we're here tonight to talk about the open meeting law.

113
00:09:10,578 --> 00:09:12,199
I'm gonna talk about best practices.

114
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:16,160
I'm gonna go through the sort of fundamentals of the open meeting law.

115
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:30,952
We certainly start with the premise that the open meeting law, public records and conflict of interest law throughout the country are really, you know, aimed at government transparency and to eliminate secrecy in terms of the work.

116
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,821
that you all are doing.

117
00:09:33,241 --> 00:09:50,189
So we know that under the open meeting law, public bodies such as yourself that are subject to the open meeting law can generally only conduct public business through their public meetings, unless there's a specific exemption applies called an executive session, which would allow you to have a confidential meeting.

118
00:09:50,209 --> 00:09:52,450
And we'll cover that a little bit further in the training.

119
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:59,453
But in essence, the open meeting law regulates the process by which public meetings can be held and conducted.

120
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:04,165
And there are really several components to what the open meeting law requires.

121
00:10:05,928 --> 00:10:08,911
So one, what types of meetings are subject to the law?

122
00:10:09,392 --> 00:10:15,299
What rules need to be followed to hold a meeting sufficient to give members of the public notice?

123
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,983
And what are the common violations and why?

124
00:10:18,821 --> 00:10:43,407
And I think this is always a good idea to cover, again, not to scare anyone or detract from any of the important work that you all are doing, but really just so we're all aware of what the Attorney General's Division of Open Government requires in terms of enforcement, and really to make sure everyone's on the same page with respect to the work and business of the committee.

125
00:10:45,424 --> 00:10:50,826
The open meeting law addresses four major issues, so I want to cover those in detail.

126
00:10:51,806 --> 00:10:59,248
And apologies if this is, you know, some information that many of the members may have, but I think it's always a good idea to do a refresher.

127
00:11:00,268 --> 00:11:02,949
We know that the open meeting law requires notice.

128
00:11:03,469 --> 00:11:10,091
Essentially, it requires that postings be conducted no more than 48 weekday hours prior to the meeting.

129
00:11:11,192 --> 00:11:11,952
We know that the

130
00:11:12,934 --> 00:11:23,044
notice has to be posted in a location accessible 24 hours a day, including the website, and the meeting has to be held in an accessible location under the ADA.

131
00:11:23,765 --> 00:11:28,369
If you are meeting virtually or in a hybrid format, we can talk about that.

132
00:11:28,469 --> 00:11:37,898
Certainly, information should be available so members of the public know how to log in at home, and any location that you're meeting in person should be accessible as well.

133
00:11:39,244 --> 00:11:46,571
We also know that the meeting notice or the agenda should have detailed subject matter items, so we'll talk a little bit about what that means.

134
00:11:47,031 --> 00:12:02,486
But it's a detailed list of topics that you will all review so that a member of the public can look at that meeting notice at home and say, yes, I'd like to attend the meeting because I know these topics are going to be covered, or no, I'm going to pass on this one and go to the next one.

135
00:12:03,655 --> 00:12:10,018
someone should be able to say, I understand what this meeting is about and I want to attend this meeting based on what's on the meeting notice.

136
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:13,939
We're going to talk a little bit about the nature of the meeting.

137
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:22,463
As I mentioned at the beginning, there's a presumption under the open meeting law because of government transparency issues for an open session.

138
00:12:22,563 --> 00:12:29,046
So the meetings conducted as we're meeting tonight in an open session so members of the public can see in real time

139
00:12:29,659 --> 00:12:41,443
what the public body is doing, the votes that are being conducted and the deliberation, and we'll talk about what that means, of the body's business and the public business being conducted.

140
00:12:42,403 --> 00:12:52,687
There are certain pretty narrowly tailored reasons for a closed or an executive session, and we'll talk about the procedures if you do end up meeting in executive session.

141
00:12:54,947 --> 00:12:56,488
Conduct of the meeting, this is a hot,

142
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:02,981
hot topic in recent years, essentially, you know, what rules govern public comment?

143
00:13:03,481 --> 00:13:06,102
What are the free speech principles that may apply?

144
00:13:06,923 --> 00:13:10,344
Who gets to speak and when in remote and hybrid meetings?

145
00:13:10,364 --> 00:13:11,225
So we'll cover that.

146
00:13:11,245 --> 00:13:17,067
And then the fourth major component of the open meeting law is the meeting minutes themselves.

147
00:13:17,607 --> 00:13:24,530
Essentially the content of the meeting, detailed enough, similar to a meeting notice to allow someone that wasn't present

148
00:13:25,014 --> 00:13:27,775
to know what transpired or what took place at the meeting.

149
00:13:27,795 --> 00:13:41,781
The timing for drafting and approving those meeting minutes, essentially for an open meeting within three meetings or 30 days, whichever is later, is a standard that the Attorney General's Division of Open Government established.

150
00:13:43,161 --> 00:13:45,302
And we'll talk about the process to do that.

151
00:13:46,022 --> 00:13:48,083
Most of the public bodies that I work with

152
00:13:48,678 --> 00:13:59,722
usually have them approved at a, you know, an open meeting of the public body for any meeting minutes, but some decide to designate that task to the chair or to another individual.

153
00:13:59,962 --> 00:14:04,384
That's a policy decision, but we can talk about that if anyone has any questions on that as well.

154
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:09,145
So we'll go through the overview essentially.

155
00:14:09,165 --> 00:14:15,287
48 hours, I can't tell you how important that is prior to the date of the meeting.

156
00:14:15,327 --> 00:14:16,948
So certainly to be cognizant of

157
00:14:17,512 --> 00:14:38,361
legal holidays, vacation schedules, certainly as the summer months come up and there's various holidays in play, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, as well as July 4th, something to be aware of as you schedule meetings that it's 48 weekday hours, not including holidays or weekends.

158
00:14:39,142 --> 00:14:43,063
The meeting notice should list all the topics with specificity.

159
00:14:43,804 --> 00:14:46,765
And regardless of whether the meeting was posted correctly,

160
00:14:47,628 --> 00:14:55,895
We know that the open meeting law says that a meeting occurs whenever a quorum of your public body discusses matters within its jurisdiction.

161
00:14:56,055 --> 00:15:14,029
So we're gonna spend a lot of time on email practices and text message practices, because I certainly agree with the statement at the beginning of the meeting, that in essence, it's just as important what occurs outside of a public body's meeting under the open meeting law as to what occurs during a meeting.

162
00:15:14,471 --> 00:15:19,532
So we're gonna talk about pitfalls and some things to be careful of relative to your work.

163
00:15:21,673 --> 00:15:37,356
And essentially something that I see all the time and to be careful about is that we know that a quorum can be reached regardless of whether an email goes to the entire public body or whether it goes to several members and then it's forwarded to other members.

164
00:15:37,396 --> 00:15:38,596
So we're gonna talk about that.

165
00:15:39,036 --> 00:15:42,817
We call that serial communications and it's something with the,

166
00:15:43,427 --> 00:15:46,489
you know, explosion and all of us use technology all the time.

167
00:15:46,970 --> 00:16:01,601
It's something to be aware of, certainly, as you serve relative to the open meeting law to not get into a situation where there's deliberation over email or text message or other social media mechanisms.

168
00:16:04,383 --> 00:16:12,610
Subcommittees, I don't know if you intend to create any subcommittees, but certainly wanting to review that as well as we provide an overview.

169
00:16:13,637 --> 00:16:17,059
A subcommittee is also subject to the open meeting law.

170
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:32,148
The intent to create a subcommittee essentially is not required, and the attorney general will look to determine whether or not the subcommittee is within government, empowered to act collectively in serving a public purpose.

171
00:16:33,108 --> 00:16:41,393
So generally speaking, unless there's an exception, and we'll talk about that, a subcommittee of your committee is essentially subject to the open meeting law.

172
00:16:41,789 --> 00:16:43,950
just as the entire compliment would be.

173
00:16:45,531 --> 00:16:47,512
You know, there are exceptions to that.

174
00:16:47,572 --> 00:16:59,479
If the mayor created a subcommittee to advise just herself or the superintendent did, where they are not individually subject to the open meeting law, a subcommittee created by them wouldn't be.

175
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,301
It's a very fact specific analysis.

176
00:17:02,361 --> 00:17:09,445
So we just wanna be really careful with respect to the creation of subcommittees or working groups or task forces.

177
00:17:10,297 --> 00:17:13,320
to determine whether or not they are subject to the open meeting law.

178
00:17:14,281 --> 00:17:20,226
Some practical ways, I try to be practical as many of you know, to avoid violations of the open meeting law.

179
00:17:20,747 --> 00:17:24,550
One person reporting back to the public body doesn't create a subcommittee.

180
00:17:25,731 --> 00:17:36,561
And if multiple members are using, doing work on behalf of the public body, you would wanna post a meeting and comply with the open meeting law.

181
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:40,073
Any questions so far?

182
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:43,514
Okay, I'll continue on.

183
00:17:45,235 --> 00:17:47,175
Some tips to stay out of trouble.

184
00:17:47,195 --> 00:17:56,799
And this is all things that I've seen in advising municipalities since 2006 on open meeting law and public records issues.

185
00:17:56,939 --> 00:17:59,780
So it certainly comes from experience.

186
00:18:00,941 --> 00:18:05,923
If you are attending a meeting of another public body, school committees, city council,

187
00:18:06,613 --> 00:18:06,993
the city of Medford.

188
00:18:07,013 --> 00:18:07,514
Um another.

189
00:18:07,574 --> 00:18:13,097
I'm sure you're all very involved in the city of Medford and the work that the city does.

190
00:18:13,277 --> 00:18:20,681
You want to avoid creating the appearance, whether that be at another public bodies meeting or social event or community event.

191
00:18:21,341 --> 00:18:26,004
Um that you are discussing matters within this public bodies jurisdiction.

192
00:18:26,024 --> 00:18:30,887
Um I've handled open meeting law complaints or issues over the years where there's an

193
00:18:37,293 --> 00:18:47,517
or there was a community event and I think that they were talking about X, Y and Z. So certainly you wanna avoid the appearance that you are discussing municipal business.

194
00:18:48,037 --> 00:19:03,183
To the extent you need to meet jointly with the city council or the school committee or another public body, you can post a joint meeting to be held at the same time and place and then minutes would be prepared just as they would for any other meeting that you may have.

195
00:19:03,964 --> 00:19:06,765
If you're doing a site visit, certainly,

196
00:19:07,694 --> 00:19:15,697
best practice may be to send a representative to report back, and then that content is included in the next session's meeting minutes.

197
00:19:16,937 --> 00:19:24,660
You don't want to be in a position where there's a site visit at a particular location, for instance, that is not accessible.

198
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:36,384
And then we're going to spend a lot of time tonight on email, but I can't reiterate this enough to try to avoid the use of email or text messages or social media.

199
00:19:36,986 --> 00:19:39,707
amongst a quorum of your public body.

200
00:19:42,928 --> 00:19:49,050
Locations, you're gonna wanna file your meeting notice with the city clerk and they're online as well.

201
00:19:49,851 --> 00:19:55,073
Some best practices with respect to using your or posting your meeting notice.

202
00:19:56,193 --> 00:20:00,334
I would recommend not using acronyms or abbreviations.

203
00:20:00,555 --> 00:20:04,436
Really someone that just moved to the city of Medford should be able to pick it up and say,

204
00:20:04,983 --> 00:20:06,845
I understand what's going on at this meeting.

205
00:20:07,405 --> 00:20:25,743
We all that do work with public bodies and public entities understand terms like MSBCA or MSBA, DEP, you know, DEF DESI, but certainly, you know, for the first time, you may want to spell it out just so everyone knows what is being discussed.

206
00:20:26,364 --> 00:20:29,647
The meeting notice should indicate the date and time of the posting.

207
00:20:30,205 --> 00:20:33,448
And if you do revise it, I don't know what the practice is going to be.

208
00:20:33,489 --> 00:20:39,535
You're going to want to include both the date that it was originally drafted and then the revised date as well.

209
00:20:39,775 --> 00:20:42,018
And that should be done 48 hours, 48 business hours in advance.

210
00:20:48,326 --> 00:20:55,387
Regularly occurring items do need some more detail than just these examples that I've used.

211
00:20:56,327 --> 00:21:10,570
What we know from recent determinations from the Division of Open Government is that more detail is better than less detail, so we don't really want to use categories such as new business, old business, or departmental report.

212
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:17,491
We really want to specify, for instance, correspondence and list if there's any notable correspondence or

213
00:21:18,847 --> 00:21:24,431
you know, budget analysis and list any particular reports, for instance, that are going to be done.

214
00:21:24,891 --> 00:21:36,000
So I would recommend erring on the side of more, not less specificity, which should be helpful to alert members of the public about the exact topics that are going to be discussed.

215
00:21:37,882 --> 00:21:39,603
Any questions on any of this?

216
00:21:43,106 --> 00:21:43,326
Great.

217
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:54,465
Some practical considerations, and this does come up obviously from time to time, scheduling matters or space limitations.

218
00:21:55,145 --> 00:22:04,710
Generally, a meeting may not be continued from one night to the next as a matter of course, unless that continuation is posted under the open meeting law.

219
00:22:04,771 --> 00:22:11,234
So if you couldn't meet tonight, would have to reschedule this meeting and repost it for the new date and time.

220
00:22:12,594 --> 00:22:22,179
And the notice requirement under the open meeting law doesn't substitute or supersede any other notice requirements if you have them under any other legal requirements.

221
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:28,883
So always worth double checking to make sure you're covering any publication notice or anything else that may be required.

222
00:22:31,285 --> 00:22:32,145
Emergencies.

223
00:22:32,165 --> 00:22:39,189
I can't tell you how many questions I get regarding emergencies, particularly in the winter months with inclement weather.

224
00:22:40,732 --> 00:22:48,614
There are very limited instances when a public body can meet without that 48 hours notice that's required.

225
00:22:49,714 --> 00:22:52,595
Poor planning doesn't equal an emergency.

226
00:22:52,675 --> 00:22:55,975
We know from determinations of the Attorney General's office.

227
00:22:56,555 --> 00:23:08,798
So if there was just a mishap with respect to scheduling, and I certainly understand everyone's doing the best they can, and you certainly have a lot of schedules to figure out,

228
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:20,910
with respect to the public body's business, but generally an emergency is limited to natural disasters, public health matters, and public safety issues.

229
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,530
So something to be aware of.

230
00:23:23,651 --> 00:23:32,516
We can talk a little bit about if something's unanticipated, that's a little bit different, but hosting is really limited in the emergency context.

231
00:23:33,577 --> 00:23:35,878
If you do have an emergency you really need to meet,

232
00:23:36,374 --> 00:23:43,439
There's a specific reason why the 48 hours couldn't have been, it couldn't have been posted with the 48 hours.

233
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:52,245
You do want to comply with the open meeting law to the extent you can, and really limit deliberations to just that emergency matter.

234
00:23:53,126 --> 00:24:02,833
You're gonna take meeting minutes of that emergency meeting, and then you'd wanna post a follow-up meeting where you basically ratify the action that was taken at the emergency.

235
00:24:03,213 --> 00:24:04,854
So let's hope for no emergencies.

236
00:24:05,738 --> 00:24:08,739
but just wanted to make sure everyone had that information as well.

237
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,520
Conducting meetings.

238
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:19,882
So we're gonna move a little bit from the notice piece of this and the agenda piece of the open meeting law to now how those meetings are conducted.

239
00:24:21,163 --> 00:24:24,764
These are topics that I often receive a lot of questions about.

240
00:24:24,784 --> 00:24:30,725
So I just wanted to make sure everyone had the best practices related to these particular topics of the open meeting law.

241
00:24:31,686 --> 00:24:32,346
We know that

242
00:24:33,542 --> 00:24:48,095
If the meeting is being recorded, similar to whether it be on Zoom or in person, that there should be a public statement or notification to the public through the technological means that the meeting minute is going to be recorded.

243
00:24:48,115 --> 00:24:52,239
And the basis of that is the Massachusetts wiretap statute.

244
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:55,582
We can't secretly record anyone in Massachusetts.

245
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:02,264
If an individual wants to record the meeting on their own, it's not otherwise recorded.

246
00:25:02,324 --> 00:25:13,953
So if someone shows up to an in-person meeting, it used to be when I started doing this, it would be the big, you know, the big recording device with a tripod that we had the old VCR tapes for.

247
00:25:14,033 --> 00:25:15,614
Now, of course, it's iPhones.

248
00:25:16,855 --> 00:25:21,418
The individual must inform the chair of their intent to do the recording.

249
00:25:21,438 --> 00:25:25,821
And then the chair would make the required announcement to the public body

250
00:25:26,917 --> 00:25:32,720
members as well as members of the public indicating that the meeting was going to be recorded.

251
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:39,023
In my opinion, the chair can decide to reasonably regulate the recording placement.

252
00:25:39,503 --> 00:25:46,727
Obviously, as technology is smaller and smaller, this is less of an issue, but we don't want to block anyone's view, so to speak.

253
00:25:47,347 --> 00:25:54,911
And people can be in a position where they're not interrupting or there's no disorderly conduct in the meeting themselves.

254
00:25:57,608 --> 00:25:59,109
Any questions on recordings?

255
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:01,470
Nope.

256
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:02,931
Okay, thank you.

257
00:26:04,251 --> 00:26:04,732
Email.

258
00:26:06,172 --> 00:26:11,795
I would say, I'm going to try to do the math here.

259
00:26:11,815 --> 00:26:22,460
70 to 80% of the open meeting law complaints that I deal with relate to the use of email, text messages, or other social media mechanisms.

260
00:26:23,161 --> 00:26:27,463
So I say that again, we all use technology, it's efficient, it's quick,

261
00:26:28,931 --> 00:26:37,477
It garners a quick response and certainly, I'm sure you all use it, you know, in your other lives, professional lives, personal lives.

262
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:48,625
But really, the open meeting law does not encourage the use of email or other text messages by members of the public body to conduct their business.

263
00:26:49,992 --> 00:26:58,718
Email is explicitly addressed in the open meeting law, and it is often the reason I see for a violation to be determined by the Attorney General's office.

264
00:26:59,899 --> 00:27:18,271
And what the law requires is that a quorum, either collectively, so reply all situation, or, you know, a group of individuals or one individual forwards it to another who forwards another, can constitute an open meeting law violation.

265
00:27:19,611 --> 00:27:32,381
Members should really be cautious and a best practice would be not to use email to share ideas, beliefs, opinions, concerns, whether serially or in a single email regarding business.

266
00:27:33,743 --> 00:27:41,709
And you can't use another member to, you can't send an email to a non-public body member to then circulate out to the group as well.

267
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:49,035
Some practical approaches, certainly beware to reply all on emails and really limit

268
00:27:49,915 --> 00:27:55,756
the use of email to scheduling purposes only and try to avoid using it to undertake business.

269
00:27:57,057 --> 00:28:07,199
We should always assume that emails could be forwarded to, you know, a local blogger, put on Facebook, sent to the newspaper.

270
00:28:08,059 --> 00:28:09,059
I've seen it before.

271
00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:14,680
So we really want to be very considerate of the use of email.

272
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,421
And this is where there is the overlap with the public records law

273
00:28:19,005 --> 00:28:36,160
because even if you're volunteers, emails or text messages or social media posts that are made in your official capacity or in relation to your service on this committee really are subject to the public records law as well.

274
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:44,968
And so if you use a Gmail account or a personal cell phone to send an email or a text message, and there is a public records request for that,

275
00:28:46,112 --> 00:28:49,994
that certainly would be subject to the public records law, most likely.

276
00:28:50,114 --> 00:28:54,215
So just something to be very cognizant of as you begin your service.

277
00:28:56,976 --> 00:28:57,636
Is there a question?

278
00:28:57,656 --> 00:29:00,017
No, I think we're good.

279
00:29:00,477 --> 00:29:01,117
Okay, great.

280
00:29:01,458 --> 00:29:01,938
Thank you.

281
00:29:03,018 --> 00:29:08,520
Texting and social media, texting and social media, similar, also subject to the open meeting law.

282
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:17,615
Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, Reddit, all of those are subject to the public records law and the open meeting law to the extent there is deliberation.

283
00:29:17,635 --> 00:29:26,579
If you are a user of social media, certainly in your individual capacity, you have free speech and first amendment considerations.

284
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:38,446
So I'm not gonna speak directly to your individual rights, but certainly some practical approaches if you are posting on your service, you don't wanna direct comments to your other members,

285
00:29:39,662 --> 00:29:44,784
And if a matter directly involves issues pending, you might wanna consider not engaging.

286
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:53,887
Certainly again, be thoughtful about the comments that are made and consider using separate accounts if you do run for something.

287
00:29:54,527 --> 00:29:59,228
Remember that applicants or any individual before you has due process rights.

288
00:29:59,508 --> 00:30:03,170
So certainly something to be cognizant of as well.

289
00:30:06,331 --> 00:30:07,391
The open meeting law,

290
00:30:08,188 --> 00:30:18,334
does not mandate, we're gonna talk a little bit about the authority of the chair in public comment, does not mandate that any particular person be allowed to speak at a meeting.

291
00:30:19,274 --> 00:30:33,642
So that's something we've seen a particular uptick in, both with respect to First Amendment auditors across the state, and also I'll talk a little bit about a case that came out last year that is really important.

292
00:30:35,711 --> 00:30:44,678
The open meeting law doesn't require that you even allow public participation or public comment, though I certainly understand that most public bodies do.

293
00:30:45,939 --> 00:30:55,786
The open meeting law indicates that the chair essentially has the sole discretion as to who may speak and for how long.

294
00:30:55,866 --> 00:30:58,388
So comments are directed through the chair, as you know.

295
00:30:58,408 --> 00:31:03,492
And while public comment isn't required under the open meeting law,

296
00:31:04,065 --> 00:31:15,873
allowing the public to speak during your meeting or restricting any speech, other than based on time, place, and manner restrictions, and we'll talk about what that means, does have serious constitutional implications.

297
00:31:16,653 --> 00:31:19,035
So certainly if you do allow public comment,

298
00:31:19,838 --> 00:31:24,699
all of the decisions as to who's going to speak or for how long should be content neutral.

299
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:32,761
So not based on the particular message for a speaker or what that individual says, but just based on the time that's allotted.

300
00:31:33,981 --> 00:31:44,644
Some public bodies I work with say 15 minutes of public comment, everyone gets two or three minutes, people are allowed to speak once or twice depending on how busy the agenda is.

301
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:48,771
And some have adopted public comment policies as well.

302
00:31:48,831 --> 00:31:52,513
So certainly something to put out there to all of you to consider.

303
00:31:53,473 --> 00:32:01,836
And we'll talk a little bit more about public comment, but the chair does have the authority to regulate it subject to those constitutional restrictions.

304
00:32:05,497 --> 00:32:13,160
Public participation, whether or not to allow public participation is a significant policy decision.

305
00:32:15,147 --> 00:32:17,829
here are a couple of factors for all of you to consider.

306
00:32:18,509 --> 00:32:21,211
When will the public participation period occur?

307
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:23,232
Is it going to be at the beginning of the meeting?

308
00:32:23,252 --> 00:32:26,414
Is it going to be in the middle of the meeting or at the end of the meeting?

309
00:32:27,255 --> 00:32:28,135
How long will it be?

310
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:39,842
You know, like I said, 10, 15 minutes is usually what I see, but there are some meetings where warrants particular input from members of the public.

311
00:32:40,062 --> 00:32:42,624
And so you all may decide a half an hour or an hour

312
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:48,743
We just want to make sure it's equal across the board for anyone that wants to speak.

313
00:32:49,743 --> 00:32:55,847
How long will each person be allowed to speak and whether or not each person can speak more than once.

314
00:32:59,989 --> 00:33:09,154
So conducting the meeting, policy issues for public comment periods, any rules about public participation must relate to the process.

315
00:33:09,967 --> 00:33:15,309
such participation and cannot relate to any speech protected by constitutional principles.

316
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:21,392
Any restrictions on an individual's speech must be narrowly tailored.

317
00:33:21,772 --> 00:33:26,334
So again, try to give some practical advice here, items to consider.

318
00:33:27,174 --> 00:33:32,877
During a public comment period, you certainly want to avoid a debate to the extent you can.

319
00:33:34,118 --> 00:33:41,363
You want to avoid responding before you've had the time or opportunity to discuss it or if the matter is controversial.

320
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:52,730
And it is perfectly fine, both under the open meeting law, as well as under constitutional considerations, to just leave matters raised during public comment unresolved.

321
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,991
They're not on the meeting agenda itself.

322
00:33:55,631 --> 00:33:58,173
And so it may be something that you decide to put on a

323
00:33:58,812 --> 00:34:07,397
a future meeting agenda so that members, the public that may be interested in the topic can come to the next meeting and say, okay, this is going to be reviewed.

324
00:34:07,437 --> 00:34:08,938
We're going to have an open discussion.

325
00:34:08,958 --> 00:34:10,939
We're going to be able to deliberate on it.

326
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:14,761
So some practical items to consider there.

327
00:34:18,404 --> 00:34:25,668
Matters not reasonably anticipated by the chair that are going to be discussed by all of you must be added to the agenda.

328
00:34:26,312 --> 00:34:29,054
after the posting deadline to the extent feasible.

329
00:34:29,094 --> 00:34:30,574
And I'll give an example of that.

330
00:34:31,955 --> 00:34:43,281
If you are going to designate a staff member or someone else to work on your agenda, you wanna make sure that that person understands that it has to be added as soon as possible.

331
00:34:43,701 --> 00:34:53,827
And like we had talked about at the beginning with respect to the meeting notice, the updated agenda should show the original date as well as the date that it was changed.

332
00:34:55,259 --> 00:35:11,272
Matters not reasonably anticipated by the chair may be discussed and acted upon, but the Attorney General's Office does recommend, unless it requires immediate attention, it really should be put off to a later meeting and included in that meeting posting.

333
00:35:12,213 --> 00:35:20,259
So it really is, was this matter so time-sensitive, but yet unanticipated that it had to be discussed at this meeting?

334
00:35:20,359 --> 00:35:21,941
We updated the meeting agenda,

335
00:35:23,068 --> 00:35:34,837
and we're going to essentially discuss it, or can we put it off to the next meeting because it isn't time sensitive and it really could have been anticipated based on the totality of the circumstances.

336
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:39,861
Any questions on any of that?

337
00:35:39,881 --> 00:35:41,262
I know it's a lot of content.

338
00:35:41,802 --> 00:35:43,944
Anything from any of the members?

339
00:35:45,025 --> 00:35:46,026
Looks like we're good so far.

340
00:35:46,046 --> 00:35:47,667
Okay, thank you so much.

341
00:35:49,252 --> 00:36:01,604
Meeting minutes, I don't know if you've all determined how the meeting minutes will be prepared or created and approved, but wanted to make sure, and I'll make these slides available to anyone that wants them after the meeting.

342
00:36:01,644 --> 00:36:09,752
I'll certainly circulate them so you have them as well as some other materials that may be helpful as a little open meeting log guide.

343
00:36:10,987 --> 00:36:15,869
The date, time, and place of the meeting and members present and absent does need to be included.

344
00:36:16,609 --> 00:36:18,169
You know, I get this question all the time.

345
00:36:18,929 --> 00:36:20,610
Are the meeting minutes a transcript?

346
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:21,770
And the answer is no.

347
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:32,013
What we know is it doesn't need to be a verbatim transcript of what transpired, particularly as I would imagine you're going to have longer meetings from time to time.

348
00:36:33,248 --> 00:36:52,303
What the attorney general's office has said and what the open meeting law requires is that it has to have a detailed summary of the discussion of each topic so that a member of the public sitting at home that goes to the website and looks at meeting minutes once they're drafted and approved says, okay, I understand what happened at this meeting, right?

349
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:54,345
I understand this was the topic discussed.

350
00:36:54,485 --> 00:36:56,586
This is the general nature of the discussion.

351
00:36:57,087 --> 00:36:58,508
These were the votes that were taken.

352
00:36:58,628 --> 00:36:59,689
Here are the next steps.

353
00:37:00,887 --> 00:37:08,471
It can't be very cursory, but at the same time, it doesn't need to be a verbatim transcript.

354
00:37:09,832 --> 00:37:15,215
We do know that it should have the decisions made, any actions taken, and any votes recorded.

355
00:37:16,116 --> 00:37:18,937
You all did proper roll call vote at the beginning.

356
00:37:19,798 --> 00:37:25,761
If you are meeting in a remote capacity, you do want to do a roll call vote, and we'll talk about that in a little bit as well.

357
00:37:27,148 --> 00:37:33,010
The meeting minutes should also reference any documents or other exhibits that you use or consider during a meeting.

358
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:50,457
They don't need to be attached to the meeting minutes, but we just want to reference them so that if there is a public records request or a request for those meeting minutes and all materials that you use during the meeting, someone can go back and figure out what was discussed and put the package together to then send to a member of the public.

359
00:37:56,300 --> 00:38:00,541
Meeting minutes do need to be approved and drafted in a timely manner.

360
00:38:01,761 --> 00:38:12,404
We know that that requires under the current regulations that that approval has to transpire within the next three meetings or within 30 days, whichever is later.

361
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:25,087
There are several determinations that talk about, you know, staffing constraints or operational constraints alone aren't really a good reason for a delay in those approval of the meeting minutes.

362
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,821
Certainly things happen.

363
00:38:27,541 --> 00:38:29,923
Everyone's busy and people are doing the best they can.

364
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:41,050
My general advice and best practice is to try to stay on top of the drafting and approval of the meeting minutes as best as you can, given your other responsibilities.

365
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:54,098
A question has come up very frequently in the last couple of years, can a public body use Google Docs or another document sharing mechanism to edit

366
00:38:55,683 --> 00:38:59,964
edit the meeting minutes in advance of a meeting to make that a more efficient process.

367
00:39:01,264 --> 00:39:13,308
And generally that is not allowed under the Open Meeting Law because if several members are going into Google Docs and sharing their comments outside of a public meeting, that could constitute a deliberation.

368
00:39:15,659 --> 00:39:18,440
It can be delegated, this task, to one individual.

369
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:31,943
It's a matter of policy in terms of how you want to handle it in terms of efficiency, but there are different methods, so if you have any questions on that, feel free to let me know, and I'm happy to walk through it.

370
00:39:34,064 --> 00:39:35,164
Meeting minutes are

371
00:39:35,822 --> 00:39:42,027
Minutes of open meetings are public records as of the moment of their creation, regardless of whether they've been approved.

372
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:48,152
So draft meeting minutes are subject to the public records law, just as approved meeting minutes are.

373
00:39:49,433 --> 00:40:04,026
Certainly personal notes, so if you take personal notes that are not shared as part of the public body's official files or the school department's files or the city's files, those are personal to you.

374
00:40:04,948 --> 00:40:08,552
And I would argue those are exempt under the public records law.

375
00:40:09,333 --> 00:40:13,076
But the meeting minutes, even in draft form, would be subject to disclosure.

376
00:40:13,096 --> 00:40:19,042
And there is a slightly shorter timeframe for a request for meeting minutes under the open meeting law.

377
00:40:19,543 --> 00:40:21,024
It's 10 calendar days.

378
00:40:21,785 --> 00:40:25,288
For a public records request response, it's 10 business days.

379
00:40:25,368 --> 00:40:28,031
So I just wanted to make sure you had that information as well.

380
00:40:32,702 --> 00:40:34,102
Executive session minutes.

381
00:40:34,763 --> 00:40:45,886
I don't know how much you all will meet an executive session, but certainly wanted to make sure everyone was aware of what an executive session is and how those meeting minutes differ from open session meeting minutes.

382
00:40:47,046 --> 00:40:52,368
The open meeting law allows public bodies to meet an executive or confidential session

383
00:40:53,364 --> 00:40:59,066
for specific reasons, those are all spelled out in Chapter 30A, Section 21.

384
00:40:59,367 --> 00:41:00,887
And I have many handouts on this.

385
00:41:00,967 --> 00:41:02,828
If anyone wants it, feel free to let me know.

386
00:41:03,408 --> 00:41:04,829
Happy to share it with all of you.

387
00:41:05,909 --> 00:41:16,894
Basically, if you all meet in executive session, either for litigation or real estate reasons, or there's a particular complaint, those are the most common reasons to go into executive session.

388
00:41:18,666 --> 00:41:21,348
There are specific requirements that apply.

389
00:41:21,728 --> 00:41:22,989
There must be notice.

390
00:41:23,569 --> 00:41:25,230
There need to be roll call votes.

391
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:41,580
And those meeting minutes as opposed to the open session meeting minutes are confidential so long as that executive session purpose applies or there may be another reason to keep them confidential even after they're released under the public records law.

392
00:41:43,121 --> 00:41:48,424
Essentially, executive session meeting minutes can be withheld until that purpose has been met

393
00:41:49,005 --> 00:41:51,566
unless they're protected under the public records law.

394
00:41:51,586 --> 00:42:12,994
And the most common example of that is if you were meeting regarding, you know, threatened litigation or litigation that you were involved in, I hope that never happens, under Purpose 3 of the open meeting law, and you had counsel advising you at that meeting, the litigation settles, the, you know, there's no threat of litigation, all of that goes away.

395
00:42:13,663 --> 00:42:18,747
but the meeting minutes themselves may be able to be redacted under the attorney client privilege.

396
00:42:19,148 --> 00:42:25,293
So there is a little bit of overlap there with respect to the open meeting law process and the public records process.

397
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:27,515
So just want to make sure everyone knew that.

398
00:42:28,816 --> 00:42:38,865
If you do meet an executive session, the open meeting law requires the chair or the chair's designee to review executive session meeting minutes routinely.

399
00:42:39,854 --> 00:42:44,057
I usually recommend quarterly just to see, can the meeting minutes be released?

400
00:42:44,177 --> 00:42:45,979
Has the purpose expired or not?

401
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:56,006
And so that, to get in the habit of doing that, if you do end up meeting in executive session, I think is very helpful as things progress.

402
00:42:57,367 --> 00:43:02,350
Same timeframe in terms of a response, the 10 calendar days as well.

403
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:05,552
Not that you need to release them, but just that a response be provided.

404
00:43:07,454 --> 00:43:08,935
Any questions on that so far?

405
00:43:11,186 --> 00:43:12,227
Nope, we're good.

406
00:43:12,687 --> 00:43:13,027
Thank you.

407
00:43:13,067 --> 00:43:17,309
I just want to check in every once in a while just to make sure.

408
00:43:17,809 --> 00:43:23,372
Executive sessions, if you do meet an executive session, you're going to first convene an open session.

409
00:43:24,093 --> 00:43:25,613
This question comes up all the time.

410
00:43:25,653 --> 00:43:28,215
Well, we're just having an executive session, Janelle.

411
00:43:28,275 --> 00:43:29,535
Like, what do you mean?

412
00:43:29,976 --> 00:43:36,599
Well, you have an open session, you start, and then the public sees you vote to go into executive session.

413
00:43:36,759 --> 00:43:38,460
That's what the open meeting law requires.

414
00:43:39,561 --> 00:43:44,103
You're going to announce the purpose of the executive session without compromising the reason.

415
00:43:45,223 --> 00:43:59,028
You know, this comes up more often, I would say, for land use boards, for instance, but if you had, if there was a threat of litigation and you didn't want to impact that at all, certainly may decide as a matter of policy, we can't discuss this.

416
00:44:00,229 --> 00:44:01,629
So something to be aware of.

417
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:06,191
You're going to take and record a roll call to vote to go into executive session.

418
00:44:06,863 --> 00:44:12,066
and announce publicly whether or not you're going to return an open session or reconvene at all.

419
00:44:13,387 --> 00:44:28,936
Exhibits and documents are going to, again, be stored in reasonable proximity to the minutes so that we understand what the record of the meeting, what happened at the meeting, what transpired, and really only, I can't stress this enough, discuss the matters that are cited.

420
00:44:29,837 --> 00:44:34,880
So if you do feel as if you have a reason to go into executive session to discuss things secretly,

421
00:44:36,066 --> 00:44:39,809
And again, they're very narrow for the reasons you can do this.

422
00:44:40,949 --> 00:44:43,070
You really only wanna discuss those matters.

423
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:56,999
You don't want the conversation of we are in a different direction that should be discussed in open session because I have dealt with open meeting law complaints alleging that when the minutes are released, everyone can see there was an open discussion of something else.

424
00:44:57,519 --> 00:45:02,422
So really be cognizant that you're only talking about what you can talk about in executive session.

425
00:45:03,462 --> 00:45:20,107
And again, it's 38 section 21, and the open meeting raw guide that I can circulate after this meeting goes through all of that in detail and there's a very helpful checklist that I have as well that I'm happy to provide to the committee as they conduct as you all conduct your work.

426
00:45:24,301 --> 00:45:27,782
I do get this question quite often, so I wanted to make sure you all knew.

427
00:45:28,742 --> 00:45:46,307
If an executive session is anticipated, it does need to be listed in appropriate detail on the meeting notice, again, without compromising your position, and the vote to enter into executive session must also be listed as well.

428
00:45:47,068 --> 00:45:48,108
You know, it's often that

429
00:45:49,166 --> 00:45:52,869
You have an open meeting and someone will say, well, can we go into executive session now?

430
00:45:53,089 --> 00:45:54,990
And the answer is most likely not.

431
00:45:55,850 --> 00:46:01,174
The same posting requirements apply unless there's an emergency or unanticipated item.

432
00:46:04,756 --> 00:46:16,143
So I wanted to cover, before we go into questions, and I'm happy to answer any questions that anyone has, a little bit of the enforcement process, just so you're all aware of it in case this ever comes up, and I hope it doesn't.

433
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:28,748
You know, step one is if there was an open meeting law complaint that a written complaint be filed, there's a specific form within 30 days that someone found out about the alleged violation.

434
00:46:29,368 --> 00:46:38,554
And then from there, the public body would review the complaint, discuss a response and issue a response to the complainant along with any action that was taken.

435
00:46:39,875 --> 00:46:46,319
The complainant can essentially be satisfied and not do anything else and say, I'm completely content.

436
00:46:46,806 --> 00:46:54,410
with how the committee responded, or alternatively, they can say, I want further review with the Attorney General's Office.

437
00:46:54,671 --> 00:47:04,096
And the Attorney General's Office has a specific division, the Division of Open Government, that is charged specifically with enforcement of the open meeting law.

438
00:47:05,097 --> 00:47:13,902
There's a director of that division and several attorneys, and they essentially review open meeting law complaints to determine whether or not a violation has occurred.

439
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:17,192
There are a variety of options.

440
00:47:18,033 --> 00:47:24,258
If there is a violation that the AG's office has, they can nullify the action that's taken.

441
00:47:24,458 --> 00:47:28,221
There are fines that can be imposed for intentional violations.

442
00:47:29,142 --> 00:47:36,368
There is also the option to go to court to seek further relief if an individual wants to.

443
00:47:36,388 --> 00:47:41,913
And then three registered voters can also bring an action in superior court.

444
00:47:43,459 --> 00:47:50,584
You know, I think the bottom line here is to really take those best practices and try to employ them to the extent you can.

445
00:47:51,284 --> 00:47:57,208
And if there's any questions along the way, better to ask at the beginning than to let it go further than that.

446
00:48:02,691 --> 00:48:04,412
Any questions so far?

447
00:48:04,432 --> 00:48:04,512
Nope.

448
00:48:05,693 --> 00:48:07,074
Nope, I think we're good.

449
00:48:07,534 --> 00:48:08,175
Okay, thank you.

450
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:12,538
So I wanted to cover some recent notable court decisions.

451
00:48:13,258 --> 00:48:16,321
I've given a long summary here just so everyone has them.

452
00:48:16,801 --> 00:48:27,871
I think really the takeaway is the Barron case is a huge case that was recently decided by the SJC, the Supreme Judicial Court, which is the highest state court in the Commonwealth.

453
00:48:29,052 --> 00:48:32,134
And that really dealt with public comment periods.

454
00:48:32,995 --> 00:48:36,518
And essentially, in summary, the court held that while

455
00:48:37,025 --> 00:48:42,127
Municipalities are not required to provide public comments during board and committee meetings.

456
00:48:43,348 --> 00:48:48,630
If you are required to do so, they have to comply with the provisions of the constitution.

457
00:48:49,971 --> 00:49:05,458
So after this decision in South Borough, and I encourage you to all read it if you're interested, and I have a copy if anyone wants it, in my opinion, care should really be taken that any public comment period, like we talked about a couple of slides back,

458
00:49:06,718 --> 00:49:16,662
is limited to these reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions, rather than mandating quote-unquote civility or other content-based restrictions.

459
00:49:17,682 --> 00:49:25,905
You know, certainly this was a trend since the court reviewed this Corey Spaulding case versus Town of Natick School Committee back in 2018.

460
00:49:27,691 --> 00:49:32,272
closely tracked that case and the ACLU was involved in that litigation.

461
00:49:33,152 --> 00:49:45,954
That also dealt with public comments during public meetings where there were allegations the committee improperly limited comments made by members of the public, which were critical of the committee, but allowed other individuals to speak.

462
00:49:47,474 --> 00:49:56,996
If we look at these cases together, essentially, I think it makes sense to have a public comment policy or consistency across the board with respect to time,

463
00:49:58,074 --> 00:50:03,116
but regulation of content is really problematic in light of these decisions.

464
00:50:04,456 --> 00:50:09,878
So if there are specific questions of that, as you begin to conduct your business, certainly let me know.

465
00:50:09,958 --> 00:50:12,179
I'm happy to analyze that.

466
00:50:12,479 --> 00:50:17,420
I've worked on a lot of public comment policies since the Barron decision was decided.

467
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:21,702
So happy to answer any questions that anyone has on that.

468
00:50:22,942 --> 00:50:26,143
I think practically speaking, most people do the time restrictions

469
00:50:27,590 --> 00:50:35,516
for public comment period and decide where in the meeting they're going to have public comment based on their other businesses, business for that meeting.

470
00:50:35,536 --> 00:50:38,398
I've included reference to two other cases.

471
00:50:38,418 --> 00:50:42,262
The Town of Swansea case was about sufficiency of meeting minutes.

472
00:50:43,122 --> 00:50:45,284
So I wanted to make sure you all had that as well.

473
00:50:45,444 --> 00:50:53,691
And then the Bolter versus Whelan case was really, and I don't know how much this would impact your work, but really dealt with employee evaluation processes.

474
00:50:57,028 --> 00:50:59,190
The current state of the open meeting law.

475
00:51:00,572 --> 00:51:07,679
So we know that the COVID-19 pandemic era changes are in place until March 31st, 2025.

476
00:51:07,759 --> 00:51:15,326
They were extended by Governor Healey in a supplemental budget bill that further extended those temporary measures.

477
00:51:15,366 --> 00:51:18,890
They were put in place in 2020 and extended several times.

478
00:51:20,003 --> 00:51:29,893
I just wanted to alert all of you that there is also significant pending legislation that would either seek to extend this further or make modifications to the open meeting law.

479
00:51:30,854 --> 00:51:34,158
I haven't heard it moving quickly at the state level, but certainly will keep

480
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:48,060
All of you updated along the way, if there are changes, we would update, certainly update you, but for now, you can meet entirely in person, you can meet entirely remotely, or you can meet in a hybrid format.

481
00:51:49,241 --> 00:51:56,566
You know, I think instead of holding meetings in a public place, you can provide adequate alternative means, and we'll talk about what that means.

482
00:51:57,587 --> 00:52:02,010
Public body members can also participate in meetings remotely as well.

483
00:52:02,531 --> 00:52:04,112
The changes are still optional,

484
00:52:05,036 --> 00:52:16,938
There are technological considerations, we'll talk about that, but essentially the 2020 changes that were in place remain in effect through at least March 31st, 2025.

485
00:52:17,078 --> 00:52:21,359
And I would imagine there'll be further action on those in the next six months.

486
00:52:24,139 --> 00:52:26,620
Adequate alternative access, what does that mean?

487
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:32,761
It means that if you are providing, if you are meeting remotely,

488
00:52:33,397 --> 00:52:35,618
you have to provide real-time access.

489
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:51,642
A lag of about 20 seconds or so is deemed acceptable, but if there is a technical problem that prevents the meeting from being accessible, the stream crashes, the meeting should be paused or rescheduled depending on the severity of the technical issue.

490
00:52:53,102 --> 00:52:55,383
So there have been multiple determinations that

491
00:52:56,297 --> 00:53:04,862
The attorney general's office has held that continuing a meeting and posting a recording afterwards does not cure a violation if the meeting is fully remote.

492
00:53:05,903 --> 00:53:09,085
The public must be able to access the meeting as it happens.

493
00:53:10,146 --> 00:53:13,227
And again, this is if there's a remote meeting.

494
00:53:13,247 --> 00:53:21,192
If you're meeting entirely in person and you're providing a courtesy link or it's being live streamed as this is on,

495
00:53:22,521 --> 00:53:26,825
know Medford community then that requirement would not apply in my opinion.

496
00:53:28,186 --> 00:53:32,349
Zoom as we're here tonight is the typical means but it's not required.

497
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:40,496
Any method that allows the public to follow in real time is acceptable in light of the remote meeting requirements.

498
00:53:42,498 --> 00:53:45,320
Additional considerations if you are meeting remotely

499
00:53:46,477 --> 00:53:52,301
you have to make a public statement that the meeting is being recorded, again, under the wiretap requirements.

500
00:53:53,502 --> 00:54:11,137
Votes should be taken with a roll call, just as we do in an executive session, and remote meeting, remote members, so if there are some people in person and there are some people at home, you must introduce yourselves or be introduced at the meeting, and the camera should be on to the extent that

501
00:54:11,638 --> 00:54:22,629
someone can have their camera on and they're not participating by phone or for medical reasons, they can't participate with their camera on or they've requested an accommodation.

502
00:54:24,050 --> 00:54:33,640
When holding an executive session remotely, members of the public body should state that no other person is present, that no one else can hear them.

503
00:54:34,309 --> 00:54:37,751
Again, that goes to the confidential nature of an executive session.

504
00:54:37,771 --> 00:54:45,376
And so if we were here tonight, I would say, you know, just so you know, I'm here in a room with the door shut in my office and no one else can hear me.

505
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:47,317
That would be sufficient.

506
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:52,180
Hybrid meetings.

507
00:54:53,541 --> 00:55:00,225
Many, I would say the majority of public bodies I work with are meeting in a remote or hybrid manner.

508
00:55:01,526 --> 00:55:02,527
You can allow

509
00:55:03,243 --> 00:55:09,947
your members to meet in person, but members of the public can watch a live stream.

510
00:55:09,967 --> 00:55:13,530
And you can also allow direct participants.

511
00:55:13,590 --> 00:55:22,196
So if you had a contractor or an engineer or a project manager to attend in person, but the general public could meet remotely.

512
00:55:22,216 --> 00:55:27,739
And a member may attend remotely if even if other members attend in person.

513
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,862
The bottom line is essentially if live access stops,

514
00:55:32,455 --> 00:55:34,335
then the meeting must stop as well.

515
00:55:35,836 --> 00:55:46,138
If there is troubleshooting or technical difficulties, you do want to be careful, again, not to deliberate over text or email if there is an issue with a technical feed.

516
00:55:47,538 --> 00:55:54,320
And you can resume the meeting once it's resolved and members of the public are allowed to see the live stream again.

517
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:59,541
Public body must be able to hear and follow the meeting from their remote location.

518
00:56:02,312 --> 00:56:06,815
Okay, so that was a little bit of a, I know a lot of information to take in.

519
00:56:06,835 --> 00:56:12,219
I'm happy to answer any specific questions that anyone has.

520
00:56:12,239 --> 00:56:26,950
As I had mentioned, I'm happy to share both these slides as well as additional resources as a open meeting law training kit with all of you and happy to answer any questions along the way.

521
00:56:28,749 --> 00:56:37,671
and update you with respect to the legislation on the open meeting law changes that may or may not go into effect by the end of next March.

522
00:56:40,012 --> 00:56:41,472
Are there any questions for Janelle?

523
00:56:45,273 --> 00:56:50,254
Okay, Janelle, if you could send those slides along, that would be great.

524
00:56:50,334 --> 00:56:52,294
I'll make sure the committee has access to them.

525
00:56:52,955 --> 00:56:54,555
And thank you so much for your time.

526
00:56:55,259 --> 00:56:55,819
Thank you all.

527
00:56:55,859 --> 00:56:58,221
I'll send I'll send the open meeting log guide.

528
00:56:58,281 --> 00:57:03,504
I'll send my slides and I'll send some other helpful materials as well as a summary of that.

529
00:57:03,544 --> 00:57:05,305
They are in decision so everyone has it.

530
00:57:06,125 --> 00:57:07,086
Great, thank you.

531
00:57:07,106 --> 00:57:07,986
Thank you so much.

532
00:57:08,027 --> 00:57:09,928
It was nice seeing you all have a good evening.

533
00:57:09,948 --> 00:57:11,368
Good luck with the rest of your meeting.

534
00:57:11,709 --> 00:57:12,189
Thank you.

535
00:57:12,209 --> 00:57:13,109
Thank you all.

536
00:57:18,183 --> 00:57:20,044
Okay, so we're right on time.

537
00:57:20,904 --> 00:57:23,766
We're going to circle back to some introductions.

538
00:57:24,266 --> 00:57:25,126
This is a big group.

539
00:57:25,586 --> 00:57:27,167
There are 25 of us in total.

540
00:57:27,187 --> 00:57:31,829
We have a few members who are not able to be here tonight that let me know that in advance, so we will catch them up.

541
00:57:32,350 --> 00:57:43,094
But I was hoping that we could just go around the room and you could introduce yourself and just talk like very briefly about sort of what you see your role on the committee as and making sure that

542
00:57:44,395 --> 00:57:51,078
everybody in the room sort of gets to know you, if you have an official sort of capacity role in the schools that where they may not have met you before.

543
00:57:51,638 --> 00:57:52,979
So Peter, do you want to start?

544
00:57:53,439 --> 00:57:53,659
Sure.

545
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:55,520
Good evening, everyone.

546
00:57:55,580 --> 00:58:01,283
My name is Peter Cushing, assistant superintendent of the American Public Schools for Enrichment.

547
00:58:18,744 --> 00:58:31,075
green roof repair, boiler installation, and helping author an SOI for a project that's currently just broke ground about two weeks ago.

548
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:35,578
So I'm really just happy to be a part of this team that's going to help build the future of Metro.

549
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:39,281
I'm Joan McLaughlin.

550
00:58:39,321 --> 00:58:40,843
I'm Director of Buildings and Grounds.

551
00:58:40,863 --> 00:58:44,486
I'm coming to my 38th year at Brigham and Methodist Public Schools.

552
00:58:45,347 --> 00:58:46,347
I look forward to it.

553
00:58:47,481 --> 00:58:52,203
I was on the science lab when we did the high school science lab at MSBA.

554
00:58:52,223 --> 00:58:55,384
I was on the oil project at Medford High School.

555
00:58:55,464 --> 00:58:58,905
When we did that, that was another MSBA project.

556
00:58:58,925 --> 00:59:07,969
Hopefully I can bring my long-term vast experience to the forefront to help us in any way that we can push things forward.

557
00:59:09,633 --> 00:59:10,333
Good evening, everyone.

558
00:59:10,433 --> 00:59:11,614
I'm Thomas Dalton.

559
00:59:11,654 --> 00:59:15,535
I'm the outgoing communications director for Metropolitan Public Services.

560
00:59:16,035 --> 00:59:17,956
Thumbs down.

561
00:59:18,336 --> 00:59:22,477
But at your disposal now.

562
00:59:22,898 --> 00:59:28,079
I'm a communications professional with a career in state and local government.

563
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:35,822
But when I still lived in my hometown of Stoneham, I also served as a school committee member in Stoneham.

564
00:59:36,752 --> 00:59:43,396
During that time, we started the process with the MSBA for the new Stonewall High School that's gonna open this September.

565
00:59:44,137 --> 00:59:48,579
So particularly this period of the MSBA process, it's very familiar to me.

566
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:52,202
I was serving as a school committee member during that timeframe.

567
00:59:53,022 --> 01:00:00,667
Certainly very excited about all the opportunities that we're gonna have to collaborate with the state to gather lots of really good local input.

568
01:00:00,747 --> 01:00:01,848
It's really exciting.

569
01:00:05,178 --> 01:00:06,379
Hello, everybody.

570
01:00:06,579 --> 01:00:07,300
I'm Paul Rousseau.

571
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:08,480
I'm on the Denver School Committee.

572
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:09,981
It's my seventh year.

573
01:00:11,742 --> 01:00:15,405
I'm about to say, I'm sure you're all very impressed.

574
01:00:19,387 --> 01:00:19,927
Good evening.

575
01:00:20,268 --> 01:00:21,068
I'm Tracy King.

576
01:00:21,528 --> 01:00:24,270
I've been living in Medford for 12 years.

577
01:00:24,290 --> 01:00:33,256
I work professionally as a senior theater and facility manager overseeing the day-to-day operations of a performing arts center on a public campus.

578
01:00:34,019 --> 01:00:40,421
I'm currently part of a team building a new theater across the river in Austin.

579
01:00:40,561 --> 01:00:43,683
Groundbreaking was just a couple of months, a couple of weeks ago.

580
01:00:44,503 --> 01:00:51,506
So I bring in some day-to-day operations, facility management, and resources.

581
01:00:51,766 --> 01:00:58,668
I'm Maria Dorsey.

582
01:00:59,789 --> 01:01:02,790
I work here at Metis High School as the school librarian.

583
01:01:04,193 --> 01:01:06,274
I've been in the schools for 28 years.

584
01:01:06,394 --> 01:01:08,375
I've lived in Medford for 43 years.

585
01:01:08,475 --> 01:01:09,956
My husband's a lifelong resident.

586
01:01:10,436 --> 01:01:17,319
And I was involved, so I feel like it's, I've been in Medford all the same time.

587
01:01:17,339 --> 01:01:25,702
I was working in the old Brooks-Hobbs when we transitioned from there into the brand new McGlynn Library.

588
01:01:25,722 --> 01:01:29,604
And then two years later, I transitioned into the new Brooks School Library.

589
01:01:30,251 --> 01:01:36,913
And in 2010, I transitioned into the old high school, which was quite a shock.

590
01:01:37,013 --> 01:01:47,156
But, you know, when we were going through the building process for the other schools, I wasn't on the committee, but I did participate in some of the walkthroughs in other buildings.

591
01:01:47,396 --> 01:01:54,138
And I watched those weekly Jack Buckley events with on time and on budget.

592
01:01:54,278 --> 01:01:59,220
And it was really, I was so fascinated by the whole process.

593
01:02:00,367 --> 01:02:12,712
And I see my role as the functional part of the building, how it's going to operate for the students, the teachers, and of course my personal space delighter.

594
01:02:15,882 --> 01:02:16,322
Hi, everybody.

595
01:02:16,382 --> 01:02:17,162
I'm Libby Brown.

596
01:02:17,302 --> 01:02:18,242
I'm an architect.

597
01:02:18,582 --> 01:02:20,883
I've lived in Medford for almost 10 years.

598
01:02:21,583 --> 01:02:28,984
And I'm just really excited now that my kids are in school, that this is a project that's coming to life, and I'm really excited to be a part of it.

599
01:02:29,064 --> 01:02:34,165
I work primarily in education, mostly higher ed, but some private K-12 as well.

600
01:02:35,045 --> 01:02:40,286
No MSBA experience exactly, but we've done MSCBA work, so a little bit on the higher ed side.

601
01:02:40,526 --> 01:02:43,367
But I just think this is a wonderful opportunity for Medford.

602
01:02:43,860 --> 01:03:02,236
I work a lot with educators and librarians and people from programming through concept design and construction, especially with a lot of phase renovations and evaluating existing facilities and whether you're going to keep them and renovate, tear them down, do both, do it all at once, and anything in between.

603
01:03:02,336 --> 01:03:03,998
So this is an exciting project.

604
01:03:04,018 --> 01:03:05,159
I'm just glad to be here.

605
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:09,583
I'm Larry Brown, just an average Joe a couple blocks away.

606
01:03:11,793 --> 01:03:27,028
So I don't exactly know where I'm going to fit in all this, but I do have a lot of background in construction, planning, site development for primarily residential, but also like commercial.

607
01:03:29,410 --> 01:03:33,554
I don't want to tell that, but if anybody wants to know my background, I can talk to you more about it.

608
01:03:34,055 --> 01:03:36,177
But I guess my interest is sort of like

609
01:03:36,961 --> 01:03:45,247
helping you in the process, because I've sort of done this kind of thing on a variety of levels, not specifically for a school, but other kinds of projects.

610
01:03:45,827 --> 01:03:52,792
As you just pointed out, there's a lot of factors here, and it's got to all sort of be done sequentially.

611
01:03:52,832 --> 01:03:54,133
We can't just jump to the end.

612
01:03:54,933 --> 01:04:00,357
And if I can help with that process, I'm happy to do it.

613
01:04:00,377 --> 01:04:05,280
Larry, you're also a retired Medford vocational high school teacher.

614
01:04:06,331 --> 01:04:10,114
who also moonlights here now and again.

615
01:04:10,134 --> 01:04:14,017
I've had about 38 years in construction.

616
01:04:14,297 --> 01:04:14,537
Yeah.

617
01:04:14,557 --> 01:04:15,618
A lot of different things.

618
01:04:15,778 --> 01:04:16,939
So don't sell yourself short.

619
01:04:16,959 --> 01:04:17,680
It's better to.

620
01:04:17,740 --> 01:04:18,020
Aaron.

621
01:04:24,618 --> 01:04:26,139
Hi everybody, my name is Aaron Olopade.

622
01:04:26,619 --> 01:04:28,501
I'm also on the school committee here in Medford.

623
01:04:29,161 --> 01:04:35,645
I'm a 2018 class graduate of Medford High, so you know a couple years ago and I just graduated college from BC this past May.

624
01:04:35,665 --> 01:04:41,329
A lot of the work that I've done the past couple years has been mostly community engagement, youth engagement primarily.

625
01:04:41,349 --> 01:04:48,053
I took a gap year and worked for City Year Boston, so I was working in class teaching in the Charlestown school system.

626
01:04:48,693 --> 01:04:52,796
and then doing a lot of community work through that as well while I was at university.

627
01:04:53,496 --> 01:04:58,320
Since then, I've just been named the new program director for City of Malden's Youth Employment Program.

628
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:02,282
So I'm working in the mayor's office trying to get kids access to job opportunities.

629
01:05:02,302 --> 01:05:04,484
So if you have kids that are interested, let me know.

630
01:05:05,004 --> 01:05:07,386
I'll try to get them a job for the summer and for the school year.

631
01:05:07,486 --> 01:05:08,747
So I'm just really excited to be here.

632
01:05:09,127 --> 01:05:14,991
I think a lot of the things that I'm focusing on are, I think, just youth engagement, making sure our students actually have access to what they deserve.

633
01:05:15,351 --> 01:05:16,452
And I think that's what we're all here to do.

634
01:05:16,492 --> 01:05:17,793
So I'm just excited for all of us.

635
01:05:19,133 --> 01:05:19,394
Sarah.

636
01:05:20,474 --> 01:05:20,935
Hi, everybody.

637
01:05:20,975 --> 01:05:24,817
Chad Fallon, Principal Director of Career and Technical Education here at the high school.

638
01:05:24,837 --> 01:05:27,759
I'm starting my eighth year in September.

639
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:35,864
This feels like right up my alley because I work with a bunch of people who like to break things down and build them back up and design things.

640
01:05:35,944 --> 01:05:37,805
And we have 15 programs here, if you don't know.

641
01:05:38,746 --> 01:05:46,410
So I see this as an opportunity to expand our programming, hopefully adding three to four additional programs to our menu of options.

642
01:05:46,871 --> 01:05:47,411
Happy to be here.

643
01:05:48,703 --> 01:05:49,484
I'm Jenny Graham.

644
01:05:49,524 --> 01:05:52,188
I'm the chair of this group of 25.

645
01:05:53,290 --> 01:05:54,331
So thanks for being here.

646
01:05:54,351 --> 01:05:58,477
I have two kids in the schools.

647
01:05:59,158 --> 01:06:03,164
I think they may both miss this project before it's online.

648
01:06:05,026 --> 01:06:08,107
But I've made lots of promises at home, so here we are.

649
01:06:10,908 --> 01:06:12,648
But I am really looking forward to this.

650
01:06:13,228 --> 01:06:16,629
In my day job, I own a management consulting firm.

651
01:06:17,030 --> 01:06:22,771
I do a lot of work with process improvement, adult learning design and delivery, as well as project management.

652
01:06:22,791 --> 01:06:28,533
So I'm a certified project manager, not in construction, but I do know how to move a large group of people to a goal.

653
01:06:29,253 --> 01:06:30,474
And that's what I'm here to do.

654
01:06:30,594 --> 01:06:36,620
So a lot of the things that Janelle was talking about are sort of roles for me to take on in terms of the minutes.

655
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:38,422
And we'll talk about all of that in good time.

656
01:06:38,482 --> 01:06:40,344
But I'm just so thrilled you're all here.

657
01:06:41,285 --> 01:06:42,346
We have a lot of work to do.

658
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:45,109
And we've actually done a tremendous amount of work.

659
01:06:45,129 --> 01:06:46,570
And I'm really excited to tell you about that.

660
01:06:46,590 --> 01:06:49,133
So we'll get to that just as soon as we finish introductions.

661
01:06:51,260 --> 01:06:57,724
Luke Preissner, parent of three children in the school system.

662
01:06:58,284 --> 01:07:07,590
The oldest is seventh grade of the Andrews, and then her sister is still at the Roberts, and her younger brother is still at the Roberts.

663
01:07:09,425 --> 01:07:22,657
I think I would characterize myself as a interested and very motivated parent to improve the high school environment so that we can avoid any tough choices later.

664
01:07:24,399 --> 01:07:28,343
I think, you know, maybe I get hyper focused on things.

665
01:07:28,423 --> 01:07:33,147
And so I conduct a lot of research, some pretty

666
01:07:34,127 --> 01:07:42,831
I wouldn't say familiar, but I'm aware of how these complex endeavors can kind of fall off the rails and take far longer than they ought to.

667
01:07:44,152 --> 01:07:46,893
And so, you know, professionally, I'm a system engineer.

668
01:07:46,913 --> 01:07:54,637
I work in the aerospace industry, familiar with complexity and attention to process.

669
01:07:56,358 --> 01:08:03,622
Certainly, you know, I think my role will just be to maybe ask some

670
01:08:05,010 --> 01:08:05,950
out of the box questions.

671
01:08:07,871 --> 01:08:16,492
I know we have a lot of individuals here who either work directly for the schools or have some strong connection to the school district.

672
01:08:16,572 --> 01:08:25,614
And so perhaps I'll be looking at a particular problem from a different perspective and I'll give voice to that.

673
01:08:26,614 --> 01:08:27,614
Maybe it'll be productive.

674
01:08:28,334 --> 01:08:32,495
Maybe it'll just be a thing that's a piece of spaghetti that slides off the wall.

675
01:08:34,195 --> 01:08:44,005
But I think that's my role here, kind of an outsider role, but certainly motivated to bring a new high school to Medford.

676
01:08:44,665 --> 01:08:44,966
Thank you.

677
01:08:46,107 --> 01:08:49,851
Hi, I'm Fiona Maxwell, the Chief Procurement Officer for the City of Medford.

678
01:08:54,153 --> 01:08:56,335
It's nice to see a lot of the names.

679
01:08:56,355 --> 01:08:58,317
I just realized I never saw your face.

680
01:08:59,499 --> 01:09:07,707
But I've been with the Procurement Office for City of Medford for seven years now, and this is a great opportunity.

681
01:09:07,727 --> 01:09:16,216
There's so many good things happening in the City of Medford, and I'm not from Medford, so I'm just happy and excited with all the projects that are going on.

682
01:09:16,296 --> 01:09:17,417
It's a great thing.

683
01:09:19,038 --> 01:09:28,663
I also come from a community where we did build a new high school, middle school, back in 2015, and I was sort of on the other end.

684
01:09:28,804 --> 01:09:34,707
I was more the outreach, and I did work for the town of North Reading, but in a different capacity.

685
01:09:36,588 --> 01:09:46,955
And I can say it was an excellent project, a great school system, and my daughter was the first graduating class, and my son graduated from there as well.

686
01:09:48,112 --> 01:09:51,273
I'm looking forward to bringing, Medford deserves it.

687
01:09:53,234 --> 01:09:55,114
Brianna Lungo-Kern, Mayor of Medford.

688
01:09:55,134 --> 01:10:00,696
I want to thank everybody for being here and thank Jenny for taking the lead in all the work that she's done.

689
01:10:00,716 --> 01:10:09,699
I have three children, two in the public schools, one who may get a year or two or three, but either way, I'm just so very excited to start this process.

690
01:10:09,719 --> 01:10:14,141
Hi, I'm Marissa Desmond.

691
01:10:15,430 --> 01:10:16,410
I am an architect.

692
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:21,772
I mostly work in campus environments, a lot of higher ed, but similarly a little bit of K through 12.

693
01:10:23,512 --> 01:10:35,836
I have been focusing predominantly on the programming and early conceptual design portions of projects, but have followed a lot through from like concept all the way through construction as well.

694
01:10:36,936 --> 01:10:41,038
I have two small children, three and five years old, so I'm really excited to

695
01:10:43,362 --> 01:10:45,122
have a new school for them in the future.

696
01:10:45,162 --> 01:10:47,783
Be a part of the process.

697
01:10:48,023 --> 01:10:54,224
Also, before I started my architectural education and career, I taught seventh grade math for a little bit.

698
01:10:55,144 --> 01:10:58,525
So for a little bit that long, as well.

699
01:10:59,065 --> 01:11:00,065
I'm just really excited.

700
01:11:01,865 --> 01:11:05,026
Marta Cabral, high school principal here at Metro Chi.

701
01:11:05,326 --> 01:11:06,646
I'm a former teacher.

702
01:11:07,866 --> 01:11:09,127
I was an AP as well.

703
01:11:09,447 --> 01:11:10,907
And this is my first principal role.

704
01:11:11,451 --> 01:11:20,475
So I feel extremely blessed to be able to help build a new school in my first year here for our students, because they truly deserve it.

705
01:11:20,835 --> 01:11:29,420
I have zero building background, zero architectural work, zero anything that all of you have as expertise.

706
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:37,383
But what I can do is I can envision what kind of spaces that our students and teachers and staff need here at Medford High School.

707
01:11:37,443 --> 01:11:40,685
And I'm really excited to do that, because I think we can really

708
01:11:41,118 --> 01:11:48,101
move the needle forward in instruction by creating spaces that are collaborative and innovative.

709
01:11:48,961 --> 01:11:51,022
So I'm excited to be here and thank you.

710
01:11:52,083 --> 01:11:53,103
I'm Lori Hodgdon.

711
01:11:53,403 --> 01:11:58,525
I am the school director slash principal of Curtis Bus, probably the oldest building.

712
01:12:00,206 --> 01:12:01,427
Certainly.

713
01:12:01,447 --> 01:12:09,430
I actually love old school architecture, love Curtis Bus, but know that it's not designed for students.

714
01:12:11,228 --> 01:12:21,474
And so I'm really excited having been a high school teacher, a principal in Vermont, a principal in Western Mass, North Shore, and then a charter school.

715
01:12:21,854 --> 01:12:27,338
I've always been on either the tail end of a building project or fighting for it.

716
01:12:27,358 --> 01:12:31,400
I was a student in Middlebury, Vermont and saw it happening.

717
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:36,543
We were all wearing boots and my brother got to reap the benefits of the new building.

718
01:12:37,084 --> 01:12:39,285
I feel like I've always been in the beginning

719
01:12:39,781 --> 01:12:41,122
or at the end of something.

720
01:12:41,382 --> 01:12:42,843
And I think it's really exciting.

721
01:12:43,143 --> 01:13:08,700
I think the ability, not every town or city gets to build a new school building and to think about the future, especially with the students that I am working with currently, that access in terms of equity and kind of cultural capital and resources for our students, I think it's going to be really important.

722
01:13:10,317 --> 01:13:23,327
I've liked what Jenny has said, kind of co-localizing, or whoever came up, I love that, of thinking about our Curtis Tech students really being part of the fabric of this building moving forward.

723
01:13:23,707 --> 01:13:24,267
They deserve it.

724
01:13:25,908 --> 01:13:26,349
Hi, everyone.

725
01:13:26,369 --> 01:13:27,089
I'm Jo Bowen.

726
01:13:27,149 --> 01:13:30,952
I'm Director of Student Services here at Medford Public Schools.

727
01:13:31,092 --> 01:13:34,314
I'm a lifelong resident and a lifelong employee.

728
01:13:34,334 --> 01:13:36,396
This is my 31st year here at Medford.

729
01:13:36,992 --> 01:13:42,293
And I've gone the gamut of teacher, evaluation team leader, coordinator, and now in this position.

730
01:13:42,713 --> 01:13:46,174
I've also had two sons who have graduated from Medford Public Schools.

731
01:13:46,774 --> 01:13:49,354
One went the college route, one went vocational.

732
01:13:49,634 --> 01:14:02,617
So I'm really excited to see the vision of this new high school and what it can bring to Medford and to our students, but also to piggyback on what Laurie said, the equity and accessibility for all of our students.

733
01:14:04,261 --> 01:14:05,482
Hi, I'm Susanne Kalusi.

734
01:14:06,102 --> 01:14:07,923
This is my 27th year.

735
01:14:08,464 --> 01:14:13,687
So I, too, was born and raised in Medford, one of my favorite schools.

736
01:14:13,947 --> 01:14:17,930
I no longer live here, but my whole career has been here.

737
01:14:18,670 --> 01:14:30,498
I started as a teacher and assistant principal, school leader at Brooks, and assistant superintendent for elementary schools, and now assistant superintendent for academics and construction.

738
01:14:33,647 --> 01:14:42,030
Similar to kind of Marta's piece, I'm really excited to get to work with all of you for the instructional vision of the schools.

739
01:14:42,871 --> 01:14:47,032
I think as someone that was Maria kind of spoke a little bit about it.

740
01:14:47,112 --> 01:14:54,235
So, you know, my father was the project manager for the K to eight buildings.

741
01:14:54,575 --> 01:15:02,158
So I feel like I have kind of lived both sides of this a little bit, but being blessed enough

742
01:15:02,563 --> 01:15:17,208
to be one of the teachers in the new, at the time, 2001, the new school, it was great to also see that whole process unfold as an educator and be one of the people in the new schools.

743
01:15:17,349 --> 01:15:31,634
So I think the critical role that we all play, these decisions that are going to impact our educators, our students, our families, our community, is very important to me, so I do take

744
01:15:33,154 --> 01:15:34,415
take this very seriously.

745
01:15:35,075 --> 01:15:42,020
And I feel very honored to be part of the team and get to work with all of you.

746
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:43,020
Thank you.

747
01:15:44,802 --> 01:15:46,503
Good evening, Marisa Parkinson.

748
01:15:46,863 --> 01:15:51,206
I, too, was born down the street at Lawrence.

749
01:15:51,226 --> 01:15:54,228
My family, my mom's still here down the street in West Medford.

750
01:15:54,408 --> 01:15:57,210
And I started school in Medford.

751
01:15:57,410 --> 01:15:58,570
I started at an early school.

752
01:16:00,097 --> 01:16:01,217
I went a different path.

753
01:16:01,337 --> 01:16:02,158
I ended up at St.

754
01:16:02,218 --> 01:16:03,678
Ray's and Casey.

755
01:16:04,278 --> 01:16:09,480
I'm too Catholic, but you know, I worked at Johnny's Foodmaster at Westlake.

756
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:13,041
Devil Park was my local park.

757
01:16:13,381 --> 01:16:15,462
And you know, I love schools.

758
01:16:15,522 --> 01:16:16,142
I love kids.

759
01:16:16,242 --> 01:16:17,143
I love education.

760
01:16:17,963 --> 01:16:21,104
I've been in education now for 30 years.

761
01:16:21,884 --> 01:16:24,605
So that's pretty scary, because I was like 29.

762
01:16:24,825 --> 01:16:27,006
That's like my go-to answer.

763
01:16:27,605 --> 01:16:29,426
So I think I'm going to have to make an adjustment.

764
01:16:31,627 --> 01:16:34,429
But I'm really excited about what this means.

765
01:16:36,110 --> 01:16:39,392
Getting a new high school for Medford.

766
01:16:39,792 --> 01:16:46,816
I know at the time when this building was built, it was like, you know, probably like Taj Mahal.

767
01:16:47,036 --> 01:16:48,857
It was a beautiful high school.

768
01:16:49,057 --> 01:16:54,581
But, you know, 50 plus years later, we need something new.

769
01:16:55,161 --> 01:16:57,062
And I feel our students deserve it.

770
01:16:57,979 --> 01:17:01,442
And we have wonderful vocational programming.

771
01:17:03,303 --> 01:17:08,447
We have wonderful academic programming, but in a very old building.

772
01:17:09,508 --> 01:17:16,954
And we do have a wonderful Curtis House program, which is located in a different facility.

773
01:17:17,194 --> 01:17:25,661
We have wonderful early childhood options and our preschool program for staff that is housed here.

774
01:17:27,398 --> 01:17:30,020
And we're fortunate to have those things in Medford.

775
01:17:30,661 --> 01:17:33,943
And I just feel like Medford is this little gem.

776
01:17:35,144 --> 01:17:47,234
And having a new flagship high school will do so much for our students, for the community, and for the future of our community in general, the greater community.

777
01:17:48,154 --> 01:17:56,121
And I just look forward to being part of this process and working with everyone who's here and taking my different experiences

778
01:17:57,148 --> 01:18:01,711
you know, adding my voice with all the voices that are already here.

779
01:18:02,392 --> 01:18:23,748
And to the mayor and member Graham, you know, getting to this group of 25, there were so many wonderfully qualified candidates that it was like another engineer, another architect.

780
01:18:24,068 --> 01:18:26,470
But to get to this group of like

781
01:18:27,315 --> 01:18:28,475
wonderful individuals.

782
01:18:28,535 --> 01:18:29,716
I'm very, very grateful.

783
01:18:30,136 --> 01:18:36,099
I want to give a shout out to Luke who started the process with us two years ago, I think.

784
01:18:36,759 --> 01:18:40,400
And, you know, hung in there and was always checking in.

785
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:50,564
So I'm just looking forward to this process and just really want us to stay positive and optimistic about what is to come.

786
01:18:51,025 --> 01:18:56,347
And member Ramjani, I don't know if you want to share with them about the field trip.

787
01:18:57,639 --> 01:19:01,743
that you took and how exciting some of us took and how exciting that was.

788
01:19:01,863 --> 01:19:07,989
And it'll be even more exciting for the rest of the team to go and have those similar experiences.

789
01:19:08,330 --> 01:19:08,610
Sure.

790
01:19:09,691 --> 01:19:10,712
Thank you all for the...

791
01:19:12,979 --> 01:19:13,980
words of excitement.

792
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:21,404
I want to do a couple of things between now and 8pm and we're going to be out the door at 8, I promise.

793
01:19:22,144 --> 01:19:25,066
But just as a quick time check, two big things.

794
01:19:25,786 --> 01:19:29,008
One is I want to give you a bit of a sense of what's been happening.

795
01:19:30,609 --> 01:19:33,911
to lead up to today and where we are in the process.

796
01:19:33,931 --> 01:19:36,072
So I'm going to talk a little bit about that.

797
01:19:36,092 --> 01:19:37,933
We're going to bring up a quick presentation to do that.

798
01:19:38,053 --> 01:19:45,718
And then before we leave tonight, we will form some subcommittees so that we can move quickly on some of the near-term work that we need to do.

799
01:19:46,718 --> 01:19:47,959
So we'll talk about that in just a minute.

800
01:19:47,979 --> 01:19:50,960
But Peter, if you can bring up that presentation for me, that would be great.

801
01:19:54,122 --> 01:19:54,422
OK.

802
01:19:55,403 --> 01:19:56,964
You can go ahead a couple of pages.

803
01:20:00,748 --> 01:20:01,869
Keep going, one more.

804
01:20:01,889 --> 01:20:04,832
Here we go.

805
01:20:05,332 --> 01:20:12,699
Back in February, we started, so in December, the MSBA invited us to the eligibility period.

806
01:20:12,719 --> 01:20:15,642
And we'll talk about what the eligibility period means in just a couple of minutes.

807
01:20:16,683 --> 01:20:22,288
But that invitation said, you're invited to this process, which starts on May 1st.

808
01:20:22,849 --> 01:20:24,991
So tomorrow we start.

809
01:20:26,932 --> 01:20:35,894
However, the committee named me the chair of this building committee back in February, and there's a lot of work that has been done so far.

810
01:20:36,374 --> 01:20:39,535
One of the things that we had to do was find all of you, right?

811
01:20:39,615 --> 01:20:49,458
So in the context of trying to say, what is it that we want as a school committee for this building committee to do, we established a list of goals.

812
01:20:49,698 --> 01:20:54,539
There's going to be many, many more goals, but I did want to set the stage of,

813
01:20:55,659 --> 01:20:59,262
the work that we're going to do for the next five to seven years.

814
01:21:00,203 --> 01:21:24,800
The first is to plan comprehensively for all programming currently residing on the Medford High School campus, including vocational and non-vocational 9-to-12 education, 9-to-12 athletics, the Medford Family Network, Medford Community Schools programming, early childhood education, including, but not limited to, the Medford Early Education Program, which we call MEAP, and Kids' Corner.

815
01:21:25,692 --> 01:21:31,195
So there's so much more that goes on in this building than what we think about when we think about a high school.

816
01:21:31,235 --> 01:21:33,777
So that's one thing for you all to start to think about.

817
01:21:34,837 --> 01:21:36,398
Number two, what's that?

818
01:21:36,698 --> 01:21:37,419
Can I take it?

819
01:21:38,210 --> 01:21:39,490
Oh yeah, and I can share the slides.

820
01:21:39,690 --> 01:21:40,951
No, no, I can share the slides.

821
01:21:41,171 --> 01:21:43,871
Yeah, I can share all the slides with you afterwards.

822
01:21:49,613 --> 01:21:59,915
Number two is to consider whether the placement of Curtis Tufts High School on the Medford campus will provide increased educational opportunities to enrolled students at Curtis Tufts.

823
01:22:01,275 --> 01:22:09,958
Number three, ensure robust public input and stakeholder feedback and appropriate milestones throughout the project that complies with MSBA guidelines and guidance from the Medford School Committee.

824
01:22:10,918 --> 01:22:17,160
Listen to educator and administrator input regarding the future of educational best practices and plans for the students of Medford.

825
01:22:17,540 --> 01:22:20,421
That means we care a lot about functionality.

826
01:22:20,541 --> 01:22:26,282
So we wanna know that the spaces will work for the students and the teachers in the building.

827
01:22:26,503 --> 01:22:27,463
It's really, really important.

828
01:22:28,823 --> 01:22:51,995
Number five, create plans for the building that advances Medford's climate goals and achieves any CHIPS and LEED 5, LEED version 5 certification to meet the Paris Climate Accords 2030 and 2050 targets, and moves efficiently and effectively through the building process in a manner that ensures students are able to learn in the new building as quickly as is feasible.

829
01:22:52,536 --> 01:22:54,857
So that's a huge task.

830
01:22:55,780 --> 01:23:00,641
as quickly as is feasible is still measured in years and not in months.

831
01:23:00,861 --> 01:23:12,604
But in the context of building this committee, once I was designated the chair, we got out the call for applications, we started to collect applications, and all of you are here.

832
01:23:13,284 --> 01:23:18,105
Meanwhile, there's a lot of work to do in the eligibility phase that we've already begun.

833
01:23:18,165 --> 01:23:19,865
So we'll talk about that in just a minute.

834
01:23:19,905 --> 01:23:21,086
But if you can go to the next slide.

835
01:23:21,106 --> 01:23:22,786
So this is a

836
01:23:23,666 --> 01:23:27,929
really junky graphic that did not blow up very well from the SBA website.

837
01:23:28,269 --> 01:23:35,354
But as we're talking about the entire process, right, we are just outside the box for another like six hours.

838
01:23:36,215 --> 01:23:40,078
On May 1st, we'll hop inside the box into that eligibility period.

839
01:23:40,778 --> 01:23:42,700
At each of these steps in the process,

840
01:23:43,806 --> 01:23:48,971
The MSBA will have to sign off that we have completed all of the requirements of that phase.

841
01:23:49,671 --> 01:23:54,015
There will have to be a board meeting where they vote to invite us to the next phase.

842
01:23:54,435 --> 01:23:59,660
So at any point in this process, the MSBA could say, you're not ready to move on.

843
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:02,843
They could also say, we don't like what you're doing.

844
01:24:04,096 --> 01:24:06,118
And they could also say, forget about it.

845
01:24:06,518 --> 01:24:09,780
So our job here is that none of those things happen.

846
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:18,085
Our job is that we are going to play this clean, we are going to be comprehensive, and we are going to move as fast as we humanly can.

847
01:24:18,105 --> 01:24:22,989
Okay, so we're going to give the MSBA a run for their money because we're going to be ready for them.

848
01:24:27,333 --> 01:24:28,274
Well, we'll see.

849
01:24:29,756 --> 01:24:33,219
But that eligibility period lasts for 270 days.

850
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:37,484
So by January, we have to be done with the eligibility phase.

851
01:24:37,985 --> 01:24:40,427
I'm going to talk a little bit about what happens in that phase.

852
01:24:41,288 --> 01:24:49,077
Beyond the eligibility phase, just briefly, when we talk about forming the project team, that means bringing on board our owner's project manager.

853
01:24:50,111 --> 01:24:51,892
then we go into the feasibility study.

854
01:24:52,352 --> 01:24:57,054
When people think about what we're doing on this committee, they think we're doing a feasibility study right now.

855
01:24:57,354 --> 01:25:00,175
They think we're deciding, are we building?

856
01:25:00,475 --> 01:25:01,436
Are we renovating?

857
01:25:01,696 --> 01:25:02,676
Where are we building?

858
01:25:02,796 --> 01:25:03,636
Is it on the field?

859
01:25:03,696 --> 01:25:04,897
Is it in the parking lot?

860
01:25:05,177 --> 01:25:05,917
How's it going to work?

861
01:25:06,237 --> 01:25:07,458
We are not there yet.

862
01:25:07,618 --> 01:25:09,839
So please tell all your friends

863
01:25:10,579 --> 01:25:19,389
We will get there and we will work with professionals to help make those assessments on behalf of what we need to do in this building.

864
01:25:20,090 --> 01:25:23,854
And then we'll move on to schematic design, funding the projects.

865
01:25:24,434 --> 01:25:28,999
That is where we vote as a community to fund this project.

866
01:25:29,844 --> 01:25:33,907
I cannot stress how important that will be, but also we've got a lot of work to do before we get there.

867
01:25:35,628 --> 01:25:44,334
Once that happens, we go into detailed design, then we put a shovel in the ground, and then at some point in future, we complete the project.

868
01:25:44,374 --> 01:25:46,455
So that's sort of the soup to nuts.

869
01:25:46,695 --> 01:25:49,157
My goal is that we're just going to take this one step at a time.

870
01:25:49,617 --> 01:25:54,400
We're going to do what we need to do to be compliant with the eligibility period, and then we're going to move on.

871
01:25:55,401 --> 01:25:59,484
As we near that next phase, we're going to start talking about how can we accelerate the work.

872
01:26:00,445 --> 01:26:02,449
But for right now, our focus is eligibility.

873
01:26:02,469 --> 01:26:03,872
So if you can flip to the next page.

874
01:26:06,201 --> 01:26:10,203
The eligibility process is its own graphic, which you cannot see.

875
01:26:10,264 --> 01:26:14,206
So go ahead and flip to the next slide.

876
01:26:14,526 --> 01:26:14,766
Okay.

877
01:26:15,247 --> 01:26:17,528
So there are five things that have to happen in this phase.

878
01:26:18,148 --> 01:26:20,470
One is the initial compliance certification.

879
01:26:20,850 --> 01:26:25,353
It's a legal agreement that binds the city to comply with the MSBA's process.

880
01:26:25,953 --> 01:26:29,135
It has been signed and it has been delivered to the MSBA.

881
01:26:29,855 --> 01:26:32,277
We are one day ahead of schedule and I'm going to own that.

882
01:26:33,226 --> 01:26:34,747
Thank you, Mayor and Superintendent.

883
01:26:35,067 --> 01:26:35,627
We're on our way.

884
01:26:36,968 --> 01:26:39,149
Number two, the building committee has to be formed.

885
01:26:39,289 --> 01:26:40,210
You're all here.

886
01:26:40,770 --> 01:26:44,292
The school committee said meet before May 1st and here we are on April 30th.

887
01:26:44,332 --> 01:26:44,832
We've done it.

888
01:26:46,693 --> 01:26:50,094
The form will be submitted to the MSBA shortly.

889
01:26:50,395 --> 01:26:52,716
So we are working on that and that'll be submitted shortly.

890
01:26:53,796 --> 01:26:55,117
That's obviously the easy part.

891
01:26:55,217 --> 01:26:55,937
It's paperwork.

892
01:26:56,478 --> 01:26:56,738
I think

893
01:26:57,614 --> 01:27:01,315
The whole eligibility phase is a lot of paperwork, but this is the easy stuff.

894
01:27:01,375 --> 01:27:03,075
And we're just going to get it done and get it out of the way.

895
01:27:03,555 --> 01:27:05,896
The MSBA will need to sign off on our committee.

896
01:27:07,556 --> 01:27:09,057
We have met all the requirements.

897
01:27:09,697 --> 01:27:15,879
So the MSBA has all kinds of things that it requires of us in terms of who is on this committee.

898
01:27:15,939 --> 01:27:18,019
We've met all of those requirements with all of you here.

899
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:21,540
Now we're going to dive into the actual work.

900
01:27:22,190 --> 01:27:25,112
There's three additional things that have to happen.

901
01:27:25,692 --> 01:27:28,093
One is what they call an educational profile.

902
01:27:28,733 --> 01:27:37,738
It's a template document, and it requires us to say, what happens in this building today?

903
01:27:38,558 --> 01:27:39,959
How many classrooms?

904
01:27:40,079 --> 01:27:41,840
How many math classrooms?

905
01:27:41,940 --> 01:27:43,961
How many swing spaces?

906
01:27:44,421 --> 01:27:45,802
How big is your theater?

907
01:27:46,242 --> 01:27:46,962
All of it, right?

908
01:27:46,982 --> 01:27:51,625
So it asks you to describe currently what happens in this building.

909
01:27:52,757 --> 01:27:58,642
It also asks you to describe what you envision for the future of this building.

910
01:28:00,154 --> 01:28:08,178
So this is where those conversations about Curtis Tufts, those conversations about early childhood become very, very important.

911
01:28:08,318 --> 01:28:19,202
Because between our statement of interest and this eligibility phase, educational profile, that will set the tone for how all the construction professionals actually can do their work.

912
01:28:19,402 --> 01:28:25,685
So this is going to set the scope, as it were, for the work that has to be done to actually get this building put up.

913
01:28:26,755 --> 01:28:31,116
So there's a lot of work that's been done right now in this process.

914
01:28:32,717 --> 01:28:35,577
I have been meeting with the administrative team since February.

915
01:28:35,677 --> 01:28:37,258
We meet multiple times a week.

916
01:28:37,298 --> 01:28:38,538
They're very sick of me.

917
01:28:42,379 --> 01:28:44,159
I would be sick of me.

918
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:50,101
But one of the things that we have started to do is say, what can we chip away at?

919
01:28:50,321 --> 01:28:53,422
And so the document is pretty well drafted when it comes to

920
01:28:54,022 --> 01:28:55,162
What do we do in this building?

921
01:28:55,402 --> 01:28:56,963
All the classrooms have been counted.

922
01:28:58,483 --> 01:29:00,664
All the programs have been outlined.

923
01:29:01,024 --> 01:29:06,606
There's a little bit more work for the administration to do in terms of what happens today to accurately describe that.

924
01:29:07,386 --> 01:29:14,288
The other thing that is obviously much more complicated is having some conversation around what will we do in this building in the future?

925
01:29:15,203 --> 01:29:20,325
So in that conversation, again, we've been having a lot of sort of broad conversation.

926
01:29:21,225 --> 01:29:30,869
We've been sort of tapping into like the strategic planning parts of our brain to ask big questions, and I'm going to use Curtis Tufts just for a quick minute.

927
01:29:31,429 --> 01:29:41,193
We have had some discussion about do our educators think that is something that we should be thinking about and the answer to that is yes, they said, yes, we should be thinking about that.

928
01:29:41,953 --> 01:29:45,615
And so we started to say okay what does that look like what might.

929
01:29:46,792 --> 01:29:47,793
the requirements be.

930
01:29:47,873 --> 01:30:01,299
So we've started that conversation, but that conversation is bigger than what this committee can sort of chew on because it sort of dabbles in responsibilities of the school committee.

931
01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:16,267
So last night I served up a resolution asking our special education and behavioral health subcommittee, which is actually chaired by member Rousseau, to have a meeting on a very tight timeline to collect input and feedback

932
01:30:16,827 --> 01:30:18,709
about that very narrow topic.

933
01:30:19,270 --> 01:30:29,800
Would co-location of the Curtis-Tufts onto this campus in some capacity be beneficial to the educational outcomes of the students that go to Curtis-Tufts?

934
01:30:30,521 --> 01:30:33,363
There is another Medford resident who actually spoke last night.

935
01:30:34,204 --> 01:30:38,989
He is in charge of a very comparable program at Somerville.

936
01:30:39,702 --> 01:30:46,348
He talked about this transition just happening in Somerville and how it exploded his population.

937
01:30:47,569 --> 01:30:58,478
It has changed the game for the students who need that alternative setting in terms of access to things like sports teams, in our case, the vocational programs.

938
01:30:59,159 --> 01:31:01,261
So there's huge, huge opportunity, but

939
01:31:02,426 --> 01:31:14,458
We want to make sure that the community and the committee have some opportunity to sort of think about all that that might bring to the table and provide a recommendation back to this committee.

940
01:31:14,518 --> 01:31:16,500
So that has been turfed.

941
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:20,664
Last night, officially, to the Special Education Subcommittee, they will meet.

942
01:31:21,064 --> 01:31:24,888
They will invite current staff, current students, former students,

943
01:31:26,129 --> 01:31:27,952
community members, etc, etc.

944
01:31:27,992 --> 01:31:33,059
And Jack Hevery from Somerville to come and talk and work through that and provide a recommendation.

945
01:31:33,139 --> 01:31:37,905
So they're on their way, that will come back by mid-June.

946
01:31:38,706 --> 01:31:42,351
So they have their work cut out for them, but that will help us inform

947
01:31:43,092 --> 01:31:47,295
the drafting of that piece of what we envisioned for this school.

948
01:31:47,355 --> 01:31:54,281
Because what we likely will need is not just a couple of classrooms somewhere in the building.

949
01:31:55,221 --> 01:32:02,987
Part of why the Curtis Tufts is successful is because the environment is considerably different than this very, very big campus with 1,200 students.

950
01:32:03,067 --> 01:32:05,829
So we will have to think carefully about how we craft that.

951
01:32:05,929 --> 01:32:10,813
But hopefully, the work that the subcommittee does will come back to us and can be sort of funneled in.

952
01:32:12,742 --> 01:32:25,373
Marta and Chad will come to a future school committee meeting in the coming weeks and Marta will be talking about some of her ideas for alternative programming and what all that might look like even in the short term.

953
01:32:25,493 --> 01:32:28,076
And so that is something that will have to be sort of folded in.

954
01:32:28,883 --> 01:32:36,789
Joan and Suzanne and I and Paul had a conversation yesterday about early education.

955
01:32:37,550 --> 01:32:39,972
Our elementary schools are busting at the seams.

956
01:32:40,192 --> 01:32:42,934
We'll have to grapple with that problem sometime.

957
01:32:43,555 --> 01:32:44,916
MEEP used to be housed here.

958
01:32:47,299 --> 01:32:53,488
And we are going to explore a case that says MEAP should come back here.

959
01:32:54,509 --> 01:32:59,616
And that may or may not be ultimately where we land, but that is something that we're exploring because now is the time.

960
01:33:00,517 --> 01:33:02,099
We also talked a lot about

961
01:33:02,740 --> 01:33:12,086
students who don't have any sort of pre-k education, and as they enter our public schools, just how challenging the entry for those students are.

962
01:33:12,627 --> 01:33:32,480
And so we are also talking about things like how big is the wait list, and how many students come to us who have never been in some sort of pre-k setting, and what kind of capacity would we need to service a bigger, more comprehensive early education program out of this building, because all of that would need to go into this document.

963
01:33:32,820 --> 01:33:33,841
So we are working on that.

964
01:33:35,802 --> 01:33:41,967
So as these things are happening, there's been a lot of work to date on this educational profile.

965
01:33:42,367 --> 01:33:46,911
The one big piece of educational profile we haven't touched yet is the communication strategy.

966
01:33:46,931 --> 01:33:48,212
I'll talk about that in just a minute.

967
01:33:48,992 --> 01:33:56,258
But on the education side, there's so much that our educators have to do for us to be able to get that document pulled together.

968
01:33:56,818 --> 01:34:19,501
I just want you all to know it's all in process and as we go through our next several meetings we'll bring those documents forward so we can start to do like broader reading of those documents, ask for suggestions, make sure that we are really thinking about all the angles of what we need to describe and so that is where I think all of you play a really important role to say

969
01:34:20,402 --> 01:34:31,024
I think you need to describe what we're doing here a little bit differently based on what I know or based on sort of what the vision is for the arts programs or for the vocational programs, et cetera, et cetera.

970
01:34:31,064 --> 01:34:33,885
So that's where we are on the educational profile.

971
01:34:35,085 --> 01:34:37,225
Curtis Tuft's co-location is in subcommittee.

972
01:34:38,366 --> 01:34:45,087
The other big sort of newer, newish, changing topic is MEEP.

973
01:34:46,169 --> 01:34:57,697
What MSBA describes as the reason for delay often in communities is that they're having to make very big decisions that feed their building process.

974
01:34:57,778 --> 01:34:59,939
Like, do we combine two schools?

975
01:35:00,439 --> 01:35:09,166
And so that obviously has its own energy and its own set of requirements, which makes it very challenging to be able to move quickly.

976
01:35:09,246 --> 01:35:13,209
So we are trying to both think very big because this is

977
01:35:13,949 --> 01:35:25,143
a one-shot opportunity to think about what the district really does need in a very comprehensive way, but also move as fast as possible.

978
01:35:25,183 --> 01:35:31,750
So all that work has been in progress and moving as quickly as is humanly possible.

979
01:35:32,872 --> 01:35:33,873
Peter, can you go to the next slide?

980
01:35:35,177 --> 01:35:43,905
Very similarly on the vocational side, because we have a very active vocational school, we have another document that needs to be filled out, which is a Chapter 74 viability.

981
01:35:44,365 --> 01:35:49,329
Chapter 74 is the chapter of the regulation that establishes vocational programs, right?

982
01:35:49,770 --> 01:35:50,610
OK.

983
01:35:51,511 --> 01:35:52,872
That drafting is in progress.

984
01:35:53,012 --> 01:35:55,495
We have to tell them, here are the programs we have.

985
01:35:56,015 --> 01:35:57,897
Here is the capacity of those programs.

986
01:35:57,937 --> 01:35:59,318
Here is our current enrollment.

987
01:35:59,818 --> 01:36:01,300
And things like, what is our wait list?

988
01:36:02,116 --> 01:36:07,997
We also have an opportunity to describe intended expansion of these programs.

989
01:36:08,677 --> 01:36:13,779
Chad and Peter will be at the school committee talking about potential for expansion.

990
01:36:13,839 --> 01:36:18,720
That is a school committee matter because expanded program takes much more than just a building.

991
01:36:19,120 --> 01:36:20,620
It takes equipment, it takes staffing.

992
01:36:20,660 --> 01:36:22,621
So the school committee has to weigh in on that.

993
01:36:23,001 --> 01:36:28,562
So that's gonna come before the school committee on May 20th, and that will feed sort of the finalization of

994
01:36:28,982 --> 01:36:33,616
the chapter 70 form and and this group will read through and sort of get ready for that as well.

995
01:36:34,677 --> 01:36:45,041
Um, and then there is a piece, um, of the puzzle, which, um, the mayor and the superintendent and I are talking to MSBA about later this week, which is really information around city planning.

996
01:36:45,461 --> 01:36:52,864
So we can start to, um, feed information into what they call their enrollment study that helps size the building.

997
01:36:52,884 --> 01:36:57,126
So you've probably heard a lot about this building was built for 4,000 students, and now there's only 1200 that.

998
01:36:59,412 --> 01:37:03,494
Whether 4,000 was the number or not, I don't know, but it is true that the number is different.

999
01:37:04,735 --> 01:37:12,199
And so one of the things that the MSBA will do in the eligibility phase is they will say, we're going to build a building for this many students.

1000
01:37:12,799 --> 01:37:17,761
That usually tracks with something like what happens in the building today.

1001
01:37:17,781 --> 01:37:28,187
However, if there's huge planned expansion in the city in terms of housing units going up for development, they're going to want to know all of that.

1002
01:37:29,428 --> 01:37:34,392
So that they can size the building because they don't want us to build a building that is immediately out of capacity.

1003
01:37:34,773 --> 01:37:41,859
They also don't want us to build a building that will never be at capacity, right so so that's some of the work that's happening there.

1004
01:37:44,315 --> 01:37:47,838
Fourth thing, maintenance documents.

1005
01:37:47,898 --> 01:37:53,602
There's a questionnaire that we have to answer that outlines all of our maintenance practices across the district.

1006
01:37:54,082 --> 01:37:57,165
So it's things like, do you do recommissioning?

1007
01:37:57,425 --> 01:37:58,766
And how is your staff trained?

1008
01:37:58,806 --> 01:38:00,387
There's like 20 variables.

1009
01:38:00,908 --> 01:38:06,672
That document is also in draft and moving along as quickly as is humanly possible.

1010
01:38:07,332 --> 01:38:09,254
We'll get to that probably a little bit later in June.

1011
01:38:10,219 --> 01:38:22,829
Final thing that we need to do to be considered done with eligibility is we have to identify funding for the feasibility study, which is probably somewhere in the neighborhood of two and a quarter to two and a half million dollars.

1012
01:38:23,470 --> 01:38:26,272
We're not ready for that yet, but we're making plans.

1013
01:38:26,392 --> 01:38:36,841
The mayor and I are working on what will that plan be from a financial task force perspective, so that that money can be accounted for and cared for as quickly as it is required to be.

1014
01:38:38,078 --> 01:38:39,681
questions about the process.

1015
01:38:40,302 --> 01:38:40,763
Sure.

1016
01:38:43,607 --> 01:38:48,796
So when it says local authorization, does that imply the electorate doesn't cast a vote?

1017
01:38:48,956 --> 01:38:49,216
No.

1018
01:38:49,276 --> 01:38:49,777
Or does it imply

1019
01:38:51,155 --> 01:38:51,575
There's money.

1020
01:38:51,595 --> 01:38:54,416
The city government has identified funding.

1021
01:38:54,456 --> 01:38:54,756
Correct.

1022
01:38:54,896 --> 01:38:57,837
In full, a part of which will be reimbursed.

1023
01:38:57,877 --> 01:39:00,378
But I think the authorization has to be for the full amount.

1024
01:39:00,738 --> 01:39:01,018
Correct.

1025
01:39:01,038 --> 01:39:04,799
The FDA will tell you what the reimbursement is based on where we fall on the reimbursement.

1026
01:39:04,979 --> 01:39:05,639
Correct.

1027
01:39:05,659 --> 01:39:11,881
So the feasibility, this funding will have to cover the whole expense of the feasibility study.

1028
01:39:12,001 --> 01:39:15,722
Not the whole project, just the feasibility study, which is like $2 to $2.5 million.

1029
01:39:17,443 --> 01:39:22,466
The city will pay for that entire feasibility study up front.

1030
01:39:23,007 --> 01:39:37,757
And then once the MSBA certifies our reimbursement rate for the project and we are successful all the way through, they will reimburse the feasibility study that is commensurate with the allocation percentage that they provide us.

1031
01:39:37,797 --> 01:39:38,897
So yeah, yeah.

1032
01:39:39,017 --> 01:39:43,220
They will use that same formula and apply to the feasibility study and rebate back the city.

1033
01:39:43,300 --> 01:39:44,961
But the city has to front this money.

1034
01:39:45,041 --> 01:39:47,003
So what has to happen here is

1035
01:39:47,363 --> 01:39:47,984
that we would have to do that.

1036
01:39:48,004 --> 01:39:52,908
If we needed to go out to an elect the electorate to procure this money, we'd have to do that.

1037
01:39:53,408 --> 01:39:55,450
We do not anticipate that we need to do that.

1038
01:39:55,950 --> 01:39:59,233
We've got a funding plan for that, and we should be good.

1039
01:39:59,293 --> 01:40:06,199
So we were okay there, and that will require a vote of the city council to authorize the funds and put it in a place where we can access it.

1040
01:40:06,239 --> 01:40:07,900
But we're in good shape there.

1041
01:40:10,772 --> 01:40:15,036
As I mentioned, all of this has to be wrapped up by January.

1042
01:40:15,897 --> 01:40:19,680
Each has a particular deadline associated with it.

1043
01:40:20,701 --> 01:40:29,069
I am going to be really aggressive and tell you that I want all of these things to be completed before the start of school next year.

1044
01:40:29,089 --> 01:40:32,992
And wherever it is possible, I want these things to be done by June 30.

1045
01:40:34,193 --> 01:40:37,794
Um, so that is why we've been meeting and working and pushing.

1046
01:40:38,475 --> 01:40:42,216
Um, and I think that, um, it's, it's important for us to stretch.

1047
01:40:42,436 --> 01:40:45,057
So let's, let's stretch and let's get ready.

1048
01:40:45,717 --> 01:40:59,021
Um, the MSBA will have their work to do in terms of, um, in terms of getting, um, the enrollment study certified and all of that, but I want us to be able to give them everything they need so that we can move as quickly as possible into that next phase.

1049
01:40:59,842 --> 01:41:01,542
Questions about timeline.

1050
01:41:03,223 --> 01:41:03,383
Okay.

1051
01:41:05,076 --> 01:41:07,818
So we have just 20 minutes left.

1052
01:41:09,279 --> 01:41:16,384
To that end, we have listed on the back of the agenda a number of upcoming subcommittee meetings.

1053
01:41:17,044 --> 01:41:21,767
I would like us to think about and prioritize two things as we

1054
01:41:22,888 --> 01:41:24,010
go into this first phase.

1055
01:41:24,310 --> 01:41:28,835
One is a communications and community engagement committee.

1056
01:41:29,496 --> 01:41:43,452
I want sort of a subcommittee, which would be no more than seven voting members, but an interested group to meet in subcommittee to really be able to describe and outline our community engagement process.

1057
01:41:43,992 --> 01:41:53,294
I think you all have seen people in the community express their concern for, is Medford going to screw this up?

1058
01:41:54,634 --> 01:41:55,334
Is it going to work?

1059
01:41:55,394 --> 01:41:56,454
Is it going to happen?

1060
01:41:56,494 --> 01:41:59,335
So there's huge community outreach that has to happen.

1061
01:41:59,535 --> 01:42:03,256
And the sooner that we start that, the more successful we will be in the end.

1062
01:42:04,356 --> 01:42:09,097
I think this is a bigger conversation, though, because also in my mind, we have

1063
01:42:09,677 --> 01:42:11,220
a huge array of boards and commissions.

1064
01:42:11,460 --> 01:42:13,544
Many of them are interested in this project.

1065
01:42:14,024 --> 01:42:21,557
And so there's going to need to be some outreach to understand when and how to engage them so we can have that on our master plan moving forward.

1066
01:42:22,845 --> 01:42:26,147
second group I would like to form tonight is the Rules and Onboarding Committee.

1067
01:42:26,647 --> 01:42:35,031
So just like you heard from Janelle, we do have to establish some rules of how we will operate, particularly around public participation, but just in general.

1068
01:42:35,991 --> 01:42:37,812
I expect this committee to be time limited.

1069
01:42:37,892 --> 01:42:45,536
I'm hoping you can meet once, bring a draft back to this group, and then we can adopt those rules and sort of manage from there.

1070
01:42:46,557 --> 01:42:50,539
And then the third committee that won't meet quite as quickly, but will meet,

1071
01:42:52,474 --> 01:42:55,277
before the end of June is the finance subcommittee.

1072
01:42:55,357 --> 01:43:01,485
So that will be a standing committee that will meet and continue throughout the life of the project.

1073
01:43:02,586 --> 01:43:07,372
It's important to note that when the time comes where the community has to vote,

1074
01:43:08,113 --> 01:43:10,937
This committee is not where that work happens.

1075
01:43:12,919 --> 01:43:21,870
So if we are talking about ultimately needing a debt exclusion in order to fund this project, this committee is not where, like, let's pass the debt exclusion happens.

1076
01:43:22,271 --> 01:43:24,133
That actually cannot happen here.

1077
01:43:24,353 --> 01:43:26,236
It has to happen outside of this group.

1078
01:43:26,976 --> 01:43:47,022
Um, so this finance committee, I see this as more, um, providing input, um, and insight into things like purchasing, procurement, um, of our owner's project manager, um, of our architects, that kind of thing, um, but also to help inform, like, the fine-tuning of what do we need for feasibility?

1079
01:43:47,182 --> 01:43:49,143
Are there other costs we need to be accounting for?

1080
01:43:49,583 --> 01:43:52,664
So there is, there is some finance work to be done, albeit, um,

1081
01:43:53,604 --> 01:43:57,285
you know, I'm not anticipating that that group will meet until a little bit later in May.

1082
01:43:58,906 --> 01:44:04,388
So we'll talk a little bit more about like Robert's Rules of Order and all of that in our next meeting.

1083
01:44:05,529 --> 01:44:08,690
I know it's, everyone's like looking at me like, stop talking, please.

1084
01:44:09,190 --> 01:44:10,691
It's 8.

1085
01:44:11,151 --> 01:44:19,154
So I think what I'm interested in is like, if there are people who heard any of those topics and said, I really want to be part of

1086
01:44:19,874 --> 01:44:23,378
one of those subcommittees, can you just identify yourself?

1087
01:44:23,499 --> 01:44:33,170
And I would also politely suggest that the school administrators maybe keep your hands down because you have your own work to do to get ready for all the rest of what we just described.

1088
01:44:33,210 --> 01:44:34,311
So you're 100% welcome to.

1089
01:44:37,174 --> 01:44:40,856
to participate, but we need you to be presenting at the school committee.

1090
01:44:40,896 --> 01:44:44,358
We need John and Peter to be helping with those maintenance plans, et cetera.

1091
01:44:44,378 --> 01:44:56,404
So if there are folks who are interested in any of those other topics, the committee cannot be too big, but it can be any size that we deem necessary in order to get the work done.

1092
01:44:56,504 --> 01:44:59,366
So those subcommittees, I put them on the calendar.

1093
01:44:59,726 --> 01:45:04,689
We will meet by Zoom completely on those evenings just to make things a little bit easier.

1094
01:45:05,850 --> 01:45:15,478
But, you know, each will have a pretty specific deliverable by our next meeting on May 13, which is to bring back a draft of sort of what their proposal is.

1095
01:45:17,379 --> 01:45:18,360
Are there any volunteers?

1096
01:45:20,262 --> 01:45:20,462
Yes.

1097
01:45:21,323 --> 01:45:22,123
For the other two.

1098
01:45:23,246 --> 01:45:24,127
specify how many?

1099
01:45:25,707 --> 01:45:28,309
I think it can be any number of people.

1100
01:45:28,389 --> 01:45:30,550
It cannot be more than seven voting members.

1101
01:45:31,271 --> 01:45:40,976
But I think if we literally have just taken all the school staff off the table, I'm not overly concerned that we'll trip on that.

1102
01:45:41,096 --> 01:45:49,841
But I'm more interested in people doing the things that they feel like are a good fit for the work they're doing, for the work that they're passionate about.

1103
01:45:53,305 --> 01:45:53,925
Thank you.

1104
01:45:56,727 --> 01:45:57,127
Maria.

1105
01:45:57,308 --> 01:45:58,108
Communications.

1106
01:45:58,268 --> 01:45:58,949
Thank you.

1107
01:45:59,949 --> 01:46:00,409
Tracy.

1108
01:46:00,890 --> 01:46:01,310
Rules.

1109
01:46:01,410 --> 01:46:01,850
OK.

1110
01:46:04,452 --> 01:46:05,092
Communications.

1111
01:46:05,172 --> 01:46:05,593
Marissa.

1112
01:46:05,933 --> 01:46:06,333
Awesome.

1113
01:46:07,334 --> 01:46:10,856
I mean, I could put on two and see if there would be enough either of the communications or finance.

1114
01:46:11,176 --> 01:46:12,237
OK.

1115
01:46:12,517 --> 01:46:14,618
OK.

1116
01:46:14,859 --> 01:46:16,199
I'm going to put you in finance.

1117
01:46:16,440 --> 01:46:17,080
How's that sound?

1118
01:46:17,100 --> 01:46:17,500
Sounds good.

1119
01:46:17,740 --> 01:46:18,061
OK.

1120
01:46:18,821 --> 01:46:19,762
Did I hear something?

1121
01:46:21,976 --> 01:46:23,937
Okay.

1122
01:46:25,438 --> 01:46:27,318
And Fiona, finance.

1123
01:46:27,959 --> 01:46:30,299
And can we sign Bob up for finance as well?

1124
01:46:30,379 --> 01:46:32,680
Great.

1125
01:46:32,900 --> 01:46:37,842
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

1126
01:46:38,863 --> 01:46:40,783
Any other takers for these committees?

1127
01:46:42,244 --> 01:46:44,124
If you don't get enough finance.

1128
01:46:46,875 --> 01:46:52,458
All right, I'm going to put you on the list.

1129
01:46:52,739 --> 01:46:54,820
There are two people for rules and onboarding.

1130
01:46:58,442 --> 01:46:59,162
That is correct.

1131
01:46:59,542 --> 01:47:11,289
I was planning to sit on all of the committees, but maybe we can ask Emily Lazaro to be on the rules and onboarding subcommittee.

1132
01:47:12,370 --> 01:47:19,037
Um, and so I will check with her, but, um, and I have put Nicole Morrell on the communication subcommittee as well.

1133
01:47:19,117 --> 01:47:27,165
So, um, we'll check in with them, but is there anybody else who feels strongly, or would you like to go?

1134
01:47:27,185 --> 01:47:29,368
Okay, great.

1135
01:47:32,077 --> 01:47:35,141
Well, I was going to say finance, but I definitely don't have as much experience in that.

1136
01:47:35,341 --> 01:47:35,561
OK.

1137
01:47:35,601 --> 01:47:37,143
I think we're good.

1138
01:47:38,244 --> 01:47:39,505
John?

1139
01:47:39,545 --> 01:47:40,827
No, you have work to do.

1140
01:47:40,847 --> 01:47:41,247
Oh, absolutely.

1141
01:47:41,267 --> 01:47:41,247
100%.

1142
01:47:41,327 --> 01:47:43,189
And I think for all of the actual technicians in the group,

1143
01:47:50,157 --> 01:47:56,963
There will be a working group before we get too far into this that has to put together an RFP for an owner's project manager.

1144
01:47:57,463 --> 01:47:59,625
That is not expertise that I hold.

1145
01:48:00,266 --> 01:48:01,327
That's not why I'm here.

1146
01:48:01,407 --> 01:48:05,831
So we will be relying on everybody for different subcommittees over time.

1147
01:48:06,191 --> 01:48:10,374
This is just in my near view what I thought we should start with.

1148
01:48:10,535 --> 01:48:11,235
Does that make sense?

1149
01:48:11,796 --> 01:48:16,840
Does anybody have any other suggestions on things that must happen imminently?

1150
01:48:16,900 --> 01:48:17,521
I have a question.

1151
01:48:17,661 --> 01:48:17,861
Sure.

1152
01:48:19,089 --> 01:48:26,715
You mentioned like the Curtis potentially coming here and all these various uses for the facility.

1153
01:48:28,036 --> 01:48:30,978
Who is exploring those options, i.e.

1154
01:48:31,018 --> 01:48:45,808
like community ed, like working maybe with a community college, evening courses like I was over there hoping about with the AGC Association of General Contractors and they're doing adult education.

1155
01:48:46,709 --> 01:48:47,790
Is somebody like,

1156
01:48:48,442 --> 01:48:54,025
putting a bunch of options on the table that you guys like consider or how's that?

1157
01:48:54,345 --> 01:48:57,827
Yep, kind of sort of not, but not quite.

1158
01:48:57,867 --> 01:48:59,047
We're not quite there yet.

1159
01:48:59,207 --> 01:49:08,572
So I think once we get through this initial blush of the chapter 74 piece, like it might make sense for us to sort of add that in.

1160
01:49:08,612 --> 01:49:14,035
So when we start reading through those documents, I think that's a good time to say like, who else do we need to reach out to?

1161
01:49:14,235 --> 01:49:16,136
Because all that kind of stuff will impact

1162
01:49:16,836 --> 01:49:23,581
accessibility, proximity, the size of facilities versus the other, storage, parking, you know.

1163
01:49:23,741 --> 01:49:25,342
Okay, yeah, I think that's a great idea.

1164
01:49:25,362 --> 01:49:26,483
I'm going to put it on the list.

1165
01:49:28,304 --> 01:49:28,564
Yes.

1166
01:49:28,884 --> 01:49:32,827
We are in fact limited by our city.

1167
01:49:32,867 --> 01:49:32,987
We are.

1168
01:49:33,047 --> 01:49:37,049
If everybody in the room was like, Federal Rec should be here.

1169
01:49:37,150 --> 01:49:38,410
It's not in the city.

1170
01:49:45,563 --> 01:49:46,766
But community schools is.

1171
01:49:47,407 --> 01:49:47,788
So yeah.

1172
01:49:55,083 --> 01:49:55,303
Okay.

1173
01:49:55,964 --> 01:50:02,407
Yeah, so I wanted to ask, you know, who's going to resource this committee with any form of digital infrastructure?

1174
01:50:02,848 --> 01:50:04,429
So I'll reference the SOI.

1175
01:50:04,489 --> 01:50:05,329
There's the SOI.

1176
01:50:05,649 --> 01:50:10,032
There were surveys that fed that SOI.

1177
01:50:10,112 --> 01:50:16,276
There's probably a whole list of other public documents that are not actually publicly accessible, but that should be.

1178
01:50:16,696 --> 01:50:23,040
You know, this communication community engagement subcommittee is going to have the burden of

1179
01:50:23,780 --> 01:50:26,322
communicating the same thing probably to many people.

1180
01:50:27,002 --> 01:50:36,168
Yeah, that's most efficiently done through a website, through maybe a shared repository, and certainly there could be an outward facing

1181
01:50:37,068 --> 01:50:55,097
You know, portal right like a website like every school that's had one of these projects for and then kind of a back end repository where the Sheldon can look at the so why, for example, it could be available anytime to members or, you know, sort of on the access list.

1182
01:50:55,477 --> 01:50:55,657
Sure.

1183
01:50:57,678 --> 01:51:00,121
I can give you an update.

1184
01:51:00,281 --> 01:51:00,802
We got this.

1185
01:51:01,102 --> 01:51:10,112
So we actually procured a URL that's unique to this committee, and it's buildingMHS.org.

1186
01:51:10,192 --> 01:51:10,673
Is that right?

1187
01:51:10,693 --> 01:51:12,275
Okay.

1188
01:51:12,555 --> 01:51:14,477
So the URL exists.

1189
01:51:14,698 --> 01:51:16,500
The page exists.

1190
01:51:17,780 --> 01:51:23,102
Thomas is actually working on the sort of bones of that community resource.

1191
01:51:24,183 --> 01:51:32,306
The reason that we asked you all for bios and pictures is those will all go on the website, so he's working through all of that in his role as the Director of Communications.

1192
01:51:32,746 --> 01:51:40,549
Tom has agreed, even though he is the outgoing Director of Communications, to stay on specifically for this project until we hire his replacement.

1193
01:51:41,609 --> 01:51:48,772
So that website is being built both by Thomas and some of our vocational students, I'm assuming under Lisa Miller.

1194
01:51:49,793 --> 01:51:56,316
And there will be a documents component of that where all of those publicly accessible documents will be so that when somebody says, where is this?

1195
01:51:56,396 --> 01:51:57,816
We can point them to one place.

1196
01:51:58,277 --> 01:51:59,697
All our meeting minutes will go there.

1197
01:51:59,857 --> 01:52:01,518
All of our meeting agendas will go there.

1198
01:52:02,258 --> 01:52:07,000
So we've got a whole structure in place already to try to do that.

1199
01:52:07,441 --> 01:52:10,722
We're not quite ready, but I am hoping by the next meeting, we'll be able to give our forum a tour.

1200
01:52:10,902 --> 01:52:11,404
that website.

1201
01:52:11,704 --> 01:52:11,945
Okay.

1202
01:52:12,066 --> 01:52:15,395
Um, and so just to follow up is that'll be the outward facing portal.

1203
01:52:15,716 --> 01:52:17,441
How about the backend for us?

1204
01:52:18,866 --> 01:52:24,247
So that's a tricky question because under the open meeting law, there really isn't a back end for us.

1205
01:52:24,587 --> 01:52:30,128
As soon as an agenda is posted, all of its documents are part of the public record.

1206
01:52:30,868 --> 01:52:38,910
And if we are, what's tricky is if we are working on things behind the scenes, we are very likely violating the open meeting law.

1207
01:52:39,290 --> 01:52:48,332
So the administrators have working copies of the documents that they are working on and they do not represent a quorum and they can continue to do that.

1208
01:52:49,012 --> 01:52:55,897
Once those documents come here, they will be placed in a publicly available drive.

1209
01:52:56,477 --> 01:53:00,980
And when we talk about editing a document, there is no offline editing of this committee.

1210
01:53:01,060 --> 01:53:02,782
It is not allowed under the open meeting law.

1211
01:53:02,842 --> 01:53:07,705
So unfortunately, we will painfully sit here and jointly edit a document.

1212
01:53:07,725 --> 01:53:17,051
It is truly one of the most painful parts of managing this process that you all have signed up for.

1213
01:53:17,131 --> 01:53:17,472
I'm sorry.

1214
01:53:19,014 --> 01:53:29,851
But yeah, it is incredibly painful, but offline, the kind of offline editing that works super effectively in literally every other place in the world is not an option here.

1215
01:53:31,109 --> 01:53:35,551
Okay, so no Google Drive, no shared documents, things will be released.

1216
01:53:36,052 --> 01:53:38,273
When they're released, they appear on the website.

1217
01:53:38,713 --> 01:53:46,317
When they appear on the website, they're essentially configuration control and cannot be changed unless those changes are conducted here in-verse.

1218
01:53:46,757 --> 01:53:47,118
Correct.

1219
01:53:48,618 --> 01:53:48,839
Yes.

1220
01:53:50,020 --> 01:53:51,201
It is absolutely terrible.

1221
01:53:51,282 --> 01:53:55,927
We have found ways to make it less terrible, but it's degrees of less terrible, sadly.

1222
01:54:07,319 --> 01:54:14,801
And that is a surefire way to get yourself in hot water with the community in terms of how documents get edited.

1223
01:54:16,122 --> 01:54:21,664
So there will, and when we do those, I find that those meetings are far more effective on Zoom.

1224
01:54:22,124 --> 01:54:31,268
You can sit where you need to sit and everybody can watch a document be edited and there can be no sort of idea that the document's being edited without happening in the open.

1225
01:54:31,348 --> 01:54:33,729
So we have to tread very lightly on that.

1226
01:54:34,749 --> 01:54:38,011
But yeah, it is a process.

1227
01:55:03,643 --> 01:55:07,385
entirely wrong policies, 40 members.

1228
01:55:08,225 --> 01:55:15,988
And one member was like, Simon, just make sure you're in the back and like, write our comments there and put them together.

1229
01:55:16,268 --> 01:55:17,148
And the answer's no.

1230
01:55:17,208 --> 01:55:24,071
So you do type your comments, responding to have your, they were like, okay, acknowledged.

1231
01:55:26,232 --> 01:55:26,452
Yeah.

1232
01:55:26,472 --> 01:55:27,873
It's just, we're sorry.

1233
01:55:27,893 --> 01:55:30,474
This is like, we agree this is probably the biggest

1234
01:55:33,462 --> 01:55:37,824
Yeah.

1235
01:55:38,744 --> 01:55:39,744
Thank you again for being here.

1236
01:55:39,764 --> 01:55:45,646
I'm very interested in the comms piece too, although it was nice to work, but I'm happy to always take some calls.

1237
01:55:45,727 --> 01:55:47,927
And they will come back here.

1238
01:55:48,428 --> 01:55:50,148
All of those updates will come back here.

1239
01:55:51,829 --> 01:55:58,651
Any other questions I can answer about subcommittees or anything else that was on the agenda?

1240
01:55:58,671 --> 01:56:00,272
I have a question.

1241
01:56:00,352 --> 01:56:02,593
I have a question about voting.

1242
01:56:03,663 --> 01:56:05,644
Yes, when we get to voting.

1243
01:56:05,924 --> 01:56:06,725
Yes, we're not.

1244
01:56:06,845 --> 01:56:11,888
What's one thing that I've never got my head around is proxy allowed.

1245
01:56:12,628 --> 01:56:12,728
No.

1246
01:56:14,519 --> 01:56:15,080
No, it is not.

1247
01:56:15,800 --> 01:56:18,122
Is proxy allowed in a meeting?

1248
01:56:18,322 --> 01:56:21,164
No, you cannot assign your vote to somebody else.

1249
01:56:21,904 --> 01:56:26,808
As we adjourn this meeting, we're going to practice voting because we have to vote to adjourn the meeting.

1250
01:56:27,829 --> 01:56:31,951
Generally, that would happen via what they call a voice vote where everyone just says aye and we go.

1251
01:56:31,971 --> 01:56:35,734
We're just going to practice a roll call because it's

1252
01:56:36,710 --> 01:56:37,632
Again, weird and awkward.

1253
01:56:37,692 --> 01:56:40,656
So we'll do that to adjourn the meeting.

1254
01:56:40,716 --> 01:56:44,202
But any other questions before we adjourn the meeting?

1255
01:56:49,096 --> 01:56:51,637
He was paying attention.

1256
01:56:51,857 --> 01:56:57,981
But I think the other thing that's worth describing is that there are a healthy number of non-voting members on this committee.

1257
01:56:59,281 --> 01:57:02,363
The reasons for that are not because we don't want to hear from you.

1258
01:57:02,483 --> 01:57:04,784
You're here because we want to hear from you.

1259
01:57:05,365 --> 01:57:08,386
When the vote happens, we will not call your name and you will not vote.

1260
01:57:08,426 --> 01:57:11,828
But other than that, you are a full member of this committee.

1261
01:57:11,848 --> 01:57:15,430
I was cautioned that

1262
01:57:16,330 --> 01:57:24,712
when you have too many voting members, it becomes very hard to conduct business because you must have a quorum of the committee to even meet and conduct business.

1263
01:57:25,052 --> 01:57:26,633
That all becomes very, very complicated.

1264
01:57:26,673 --> 01:57:37,316
So this was sort of our attempt to say, we wanna have a big round committee, but we also need to be able to like move efficiently and effectively and all of that stuff.

1265
01:57:37,336 --> 01:57:38,776
So that's sort of the rationale behind.

1266
01:57:39,865 --> 01:57:40,585
what we did there.

1267
01:57:42,026 --> 01:57:48,188
And, you know, I think that, you know, the size of this committee is going to change over the course of its life, for sure.

1268
01:57:48,989 --> 01:57:49,789
So of the 25?

1269
01:57:50,309 --> 01:57:57,992
Yes, there are 15 voting members of the committee, which is also still quite a good number of voting members.

1270
01:57:58,072 --> 01:57:59,853
And we'll practice voting in just a second.

1271
01:58:00,993 --> 01:58:03,574
But are there any other questions next meeting?

1272
01:58:05,549 --> 01:58:14,394
The rules, the rules and onboarding May 7, community engagement May 8, and they will bring their findings back to this group on May 13.

1273
01:58:15,334 --> 01:58:23,878
So the genus, the vast majority of our May 13th meeting will be working through those recommendations, agreeing on those plans.

1274
01:58:24,138 --> 01:58:25,919
Again, so we're sort of in start mode.

1275
01:58:26,420 --> 01:58:32,463
And then after that, we're going to get into the meat of some of these documents that the administration has been working on and start

1276
01:58:33,283 --> 01:58:37,745
doing a read through of those documents talking about what's there and that kind of thing.

1277
01:58:37,825 --> 01:58:38,905
But we're going to move fast.

1278
01:58:39,626 --> 01:58:45,068
We did lay out the meeting schedule just by way of like a little bit of rationale there.

1279
01:58:45,848 --> 01:58:49,529
We're going to meet as best we can in person here at Bishop 489 for

1280
01:58:51,536 --> 01:58:52,778
between now and the end of June.

1281
01:58:52,798 --> 01:58:58,506
I promise you we're going to get back to Monday nights come the beginning of next school year.

1282
01:58:59,167 --> 01:59:07,539
But this between now and the end of June, between school committee meetings and holidays, it was like completely impossible to actually hold that kind of schedule.

1283
01:59:08,921 --> 01:59:20,648
We'll meet only via Zoom in the summer, and we actually moved the meetings to Wednesdays in consideration that Mondays and Fridays are really very hard in the summer to get a forum of anybody to do anything.

1284
01:59:21,148 --> 01:59:26,692
So hopefully we can make that work, but I did try to keep the meeting schedule light.

1285
01:59:27,452 --> 01:59:34,597
I think there will be more subcommittees between now and the end of August, but this was just sort of a start so people can try to organize their busy lives.

1286
01:59:36,098 --> 01:59:36,238
Yes.

1287
01:59:38,606 --> 01:59:41,208
That's one proxy question though.

1288
01:59:41,288 --> 01:59:42,909
If you can't make it.

1289
01:59:43,630 --> 01:59:44,150
It's okay.

1290
01:59:44,270 --> 01:59:48,353
Send your also send an email with all your thoughts and comments.

1291
01:59:50,814 --> 01:59:52,615
Chair, your voice is gone.

1292
01:59:52,755 --> 01:59:52,915
So, um,

1293
02:00:05,750 --> 02:00:07,691
Actually, this is a technical question.

1294
02:00:07,871 --> 02:00:17,275
So a gentleman can't make the meeting sends you an email indicating his thoughts and recommendations, possibly even a decision.

1295
02:00:17,535 --> 02:00:23,957
Earlier we heard emails are a bad idea for just about everything except agenda setting.

1296
02:00:24,117 --> 02:00:26,398
And so this sounds like a gray area.

1297
02:00:26,538 --> 02:00:30,860
I was wondering, so you knew the open meeting law and those two things are in conflict.

1298
02:00:30,880 --> 02:00:31,720
How does it work?

1299
02:00:32,160 --> 02:00:38,803
So I can sort of tell you that I think any lawyer would tell you don't put anything in writing ever, right?

1300
02:00:38,883 --> 02:00:39,863
So that's where we start.

1301
02:00:40,164 --> 02:00:41,504
Don't put anything in writing ever.

1302
02:00:43,085 --> 02:00:50,648
Having said that, if you are going to put something in writing, in that kind of scenario, yes, it's a gray area.

1303
02:00:51,108 --> 02:00:57,111
What you should do is make contact with somebody and say, hey, can I send you my thoughts?

1304
02:00:57,851 --> 02:01:01,033
And have you discussed these things with anybody else or do you intend to?

1305
02:01:01,493 --> 02:01:06,776
And so if you can feel reasonably sure that you've got a closed circuit, right?

1306
02:01:07,517 --> 02:01:09,938
That you say to me, can I send you my thoughts?

1307
02:01:10,258 --> 02:01:11,099
And I say, yes.

1308
02:01:11,319 --> 02:01:14,941
And I say, I'm not going to talk to anybody else about these matters, then we're good.

1309
02:01:15,802 --> 02:01:21,765
It only becomes a problem when you have then connected to a number of people that represents a voting majority on the committee.

1310
02:01:23,587 --> 02:01:31,073
If, for example, you said, I want to tell two people because I'm not sure who's going to actually make the meeting, that's still OK because you're south of eight.

1311
02:01:31,333 --> 02:01:36,397
When you have talked with yourself included, with eight people, now you're in trouble.

1312
02:01:36,677 --> 02:01:38,699
That is when you have violated the open meeting law.

1313
02:01:39,239 --> 02:01:46,585
The tricky part is everybody involved has to have the same understanding of who has been involved in that conversation.

1314
02:01:47,505 --> 02:01:48,026
What did I miss?

1315
02:01:52,233 --> 02:01:53,454
You can be very intentional.

1316
02:01:53,754 --> 02:01:55,575
I'm only telling you, and you're like, uh-huh.

1317
02:01:56,096 --> 02:01:57,697
And then you go and do the same thing.

1318
02:01:58,157 --> 02:02:01,820
We are all violating the law, no matter what we did to try to defend it.

1319
02:02:02,640 --> 02:02:06,383
So I think that's very interesting to draw a line.

1320
02:02:06,403 --> 02:02:10,465
It's that serial deliberation does not care about anything.

1321
02:02:10,726 --> 02:02:13,948
It's not content, plans, or insurance.

1322
02:02:14,008 --> 02:02:15,249
It's just the two of us, right?

1323
02:02:15,349 --> 02:02:15,709
Yeah.

1324
02:02:16,610 --> 02:02:18,671
You go and violate that.

1325
02:02:18,931 --> 02:02:20,532
I have broken the law.

1326
02:02:20,652 --> 02:02:21,413
Even if I don't know.

1327
02:02:22,236 --> 02:02:23,397
Right, right.

1328
02:02:23,797 --> 02:02:25,959
Well, yeah, that's pretty good.

1329
02:02:28,322 --> 02:02:29,923
Did we decide?

1330
02:02:30,203 --> 02:02:33,546
We are going to get everybody an email address under Medford Public Schools.

1331
02:02:33,606 --> 02:02:40,651
And I would strongly encourage you not to use your personal email under any circumstances for any business related to MSBA.

1332
02:02:40,751 --> 02:02:43,973
So as soon as those emails are set up, we'll convert everything over.

1333
02:02:45,474 --> 02:02:48,937
But I would strongly advise that you not use your personal email for anything.

1334
02:02:49,017 --> 02:02:52,560
It makes public records compliance way scarier.

1335
02:02:52,700 --> 02:02:55,322
I was the records access officer for the school district.

1336
02:02:57,003 --> 02:03:09,774
Any documents that get done in the official business school other than your personal notes are public records automatically need to be furnishable or at least reviewable if somebody asks for them.

1337
02:03:09,874 --> 02:03:22,245
So doing it all within your Medford Public Schools email address, within your Medford Public Schools Google suite, where you take notes and things like that, really helpful to just contain it all in that space.

1338
02:03:24,249 --> 02:03:24,889
Any last questions?

1339
02:03:24,909 --> 02:03:24,989
It's 8.03.

1340
02:03:25,029 --> 02:03:29,170
We're just gonna like Robert's rules adjourn this meeting.

1341
02:03:29,250 --> 02:03:32,011
Is there a motion to adjourn?

1342
02:03:49,790 --> 02:03:53,533
Motion to adjourn by Member Olopade, seconded by Member Rousseau.

1343
02:03:53,633 --> 02:03:54,073
Thank you.

1344
02:03:54,954 --> 02:03:55,714
Oh, you cannot.

1345
02:03:56,675 --> 02:03:58,516
Seconded by Dr. Edward Vincent.

1346
02:03:58,596 --> 02:03:59,817
Okay, I'm in a roll call.

1347
02:04:01,718 --> 02:04:03,840
Mayor Lungo Kern, absent.

1348
02:04:05,140 --> 02:04:07,602
Maurice Edward Vincent, yes.

1349
02:04:08,002 --> 02:04:08,223
Yes.

1350
02:04:08,763 --> 02:04:10,144
Suzanne Galluzzi, yes.

1351
02:04:10,672 --> 02:04:11,412
Peter Cushing.

1352
02:04:11,592 --> 02:04:11,813
Yes.

1353
02:04:12,273 --> 02:04:12,993
Marta Cabral.
