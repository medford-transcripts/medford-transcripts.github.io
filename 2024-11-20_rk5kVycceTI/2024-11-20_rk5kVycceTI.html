A. R. C. Grant loan order and C. P. C.

    <p>[Amanda Centrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=776.01s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=776.551s">So</a>  I'm Amanda Centrella. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=778.352s">I</a>  work with the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=781.533s">Thank</a>  you so much for having me. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=783.574s">And</a>  I want to talk briefly about Riverside Plaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=787.449s">So</a>  just a summary about this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=790.693s">We</a>  think that this plaza is a beautiful space. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=793.556s">It</a>  was renovated in, I believe, 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=797.36s">And</a>  something that we've observed over the past year and a half is that while it is used very heavily during the shoulder seasons of the year, <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=806.689s">In</a>  the summer, it gets too hot to use comfortably for large chunks of the day because there isn't much shade over the actual patio of the plaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=818.958s">There</a>  are some adjacent mature trees on lawn that's next to the plaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=824.442s">Kind</a>  of over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=827.387s">And</a>  oftentimes, folks will understandably drag tables and chairs underneath there to make use of that shade during the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=834.919s">And</a>  it is really lovely. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=836.02s">I've</a>  done the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=838.344s">But</a>  as you can see, let's look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=844.485s">this</a>  picture, there isn't an accessible route to this shaded area. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=850.389s">And</a>  the lawn that's there isn't really lawn anymore because it's heavily trafficked. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=855.993s">So</a>  there isn't an accessible way to use this shaded space. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=860.656s">So</a>  this project proposes to put a floating deck over that portion of the lawn, which will accomplish a couple of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=871.103s">It</a>  creates an accessible route to that shaded space, <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=874.486s">And</a>  it protects the tree roots and the root systems there in soil from erosion. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=879.591s">So</a>  the deck would allow for water to infiltrate, creates an accessible route, and just keeps things kind of looking nice over there as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=888.921s">In</a>  addition, sorry, I keep skipping around. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=894.795s">In</a>  addition, we are proposing to put a couple of shade sails in the patio area of the plaza to make that gorgeous space more usable during the hottest part of the year and sunny days. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=909.517s">See,</a>  so just a little bit of a close up on where those are located in that patio existing patio area and here's a rendering to kind of get a better picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=920.324s">We</a>  wouldn't you know encapsulate the entire patio space, because it is nice to have sunny spaces as well, but just creating some areas for shade. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=931.844s">And</a>  in this picture, you can see roughly where we're talking about for the decking area. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=937.528s">There</a>  is the sidewalk here and an existing pathway that runs up to this area where there's like a little stage. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=944.512s">And</a>  then from there, an accessible ramp that goes up at a gradual slope to this decked area. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=950.576s">And</a>  you can see there's some space around each of the existing trees there. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=957.165s">And</a>  here's a rendering of, you know, in concept what that deck could look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=965.308s">A</a>  couple of other things that this project includes would be a water bottle, a water filling station. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=972.59s">As</a>  part of our climate action and adaptation plan, one of the priorities there is to have, create more hubs where there's cool spaces in public spaces, and water is an important feature of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=986.454s">have</a>  a little bit of additional lighting in the style of the, um, existing, uh, lights that are there. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1000.519s">And</a>  just a quick breakdown of the funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1002.42s">So</a>  we applied for this park grant, which is a through a state program through the executive Office of Environmental Affairs, and we were awarded and roughly $199,000 <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1014.785s">Um,</a>  we have been before the Community Preservation Committee, and Teresa will talk a little bit more about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1022.788s">But</a>  for that required match funding for a total of around $343,000 for this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1034.393s">So</a>  that's just a rough overview, and I would welcome questions.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1038.555s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1039.055s">Do</a>  we have questions for Amanda, or do we want to hear from Teresa first? <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1043.37s">Teresa,</a>  is there anything you'd like to add?</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1044.911s">I</a>  was just going to add that this was a project that has been bantered about in our outreach with residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1052.158s">A</a>  lot of residents have commented wanting to see this type of improvement at the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1056.622s">So</a>  the CPC unanimously and heartily supported this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1060.786s">Just</a>  wanted to add that for some color.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1062.708s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1063.269s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1064.169s">We'll</a>  go to Councilor Callahan and then Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1068.663s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1069.883s">So</a>  I noticed that there are some younger trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1073.185s">So</a>  the two areas where there will be sunshades, the left one and then the lower one. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1077.306s">Near</a>  the lower one, it seems like there are some younger trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1080.327s">And</a>  I'm just curious if you anticipate that at the point where those trees become larger, that this is sort of something for the next 10 years that these sunshades will be really helpful and that hopefully those trees will then provide more shade there.</p>

    <p>[Amanda Centrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1095.394s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1095.994s">So</a>  those trees are about 20 years out from being able to provide basically maturing to their full size and being able to provide shade to that area and augmenting shade over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1108.526s">So</a>  you're absolutely right. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1110.26s">these</a>  shade cells are acting as sort of an interim tool for creating some shade. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1116.287s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1116.507s">Is</a>  that the same on the left? <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1118.049s">I</a>  don't really see a younger tree there, but... I think the younger trees are kind of on this area where there's some picnic tables over there, and not so much on this right hand side. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1129.161s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1130.82s">Any</a>  thoughts of like planting a tree in the south side so that eventually it will shade that area as well if that's something that we think is necessary long-term? <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1142.986s">I</a>  know it's not in this project, but I just thought I would mention it.</p>

    <p>[Amanda Centrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1145.148s">No,</a>  it's a great suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1147.749s">There</a>  are some plantings over here and landscaping over here that are existing, but it's absolutely something we could explore. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1155.893s">And</a>  I think, let's see, I think we have some shade studies here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1162.342s">I</a>  didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1162.863s">I</a>  don't think so. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1163.964s">So</a>  these are conceptual drawings. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1166.166s">At</a>  this point, we haven't done final design. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1168.609s">Final</a>  design will be incorporated once we have access to this funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1174.135s">And</a>  so we could look at, you know, what are some options to extend the beauty and also tree canopy of the space.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1186.598s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1186.938s">Go</a>  to Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1188.679s">Thank</a>  you, Council President. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1190.2s">Thank</a>  you for the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1191.26s">I</a>  think this is such a welcoming addition. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1196.503s">I</a>  think that especially when you hear some of the bantering of the negativity of the pop-up park and the parking lot where there's no shade, there's nothing that really attracts <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1208.513s">families</a>  to that area in the concept that we're seeing here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1212.836s">So</a>  I think this really fills a gap in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1216.138s">I</a>  think this is something I'll support 1,000%. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1220.0s">The</a>  question I had is I know that we've had residents that made that the chess hub of the world, it seemed, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1228.886s">So</a>  I know one resident worked very hard <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1233.069s">I</a>  know that the tables there, the chest tables and those coverings going to be able to shade those areas.</p>

    <p>[Amanda Centrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1242.062s">Let's</a>  see. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1242.863s">Yeah,</a>  so there are a lot of mobile tables that are in and around this plaza area. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1248.748s">And</a>  these are just, as I mentioned, these are just conceptual design. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1252.851s">So</a>  we could ensure that any of the permanent tables there with the chess board on top of them could be covered.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1265.382s">If</a>  I can, if you can, just if you can reach out to the resident, I'll share his information. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1269.544s">I'm</a>  sure you know it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1270.425s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1270.645s">But</a>  if you can just, you know, even maybe get him involved in saying, okay, as you kind of built this area and really made it when people didn't know what it was going to be used for, he kind of made it a home for families and kids that really needed an area to meet. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1287.733s">So</a>  I think that it was, it was a great vision and great opportunity for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1291.135s">So</a>  I appreciate all your hard work and I <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1293.874s">I</a>  think this is going to be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1294.882s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Amanda Centrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1295.971s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1304.039s">Just</a>  one other comment that I really appreciate how much, I'm always impressed with how much our city administration looks for grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1312.723s">And</a>  just so that people know, grants often come with this kind of requirement where there's the grant, but then they also require the city to put in funds that are sort of roughly equivalent. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1323.527s">So</a>  I really appreciate the work on that front.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1328.109s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1329.21s">All</a>  right, anything else you'd like to add? <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1331.991s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1333.163s">So</a>  we're going to take two votes here. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1335.205s">First,</a>  we need to take a vote on the loan order and the resolution to accept the grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1338.868s">That</a>  means three readings, and then we can vote on the community preservation committee appropriation request. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1344.372s">So</a>  is there a motion on the loan order to approve for first reading? <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1348.475s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Tseng to approve for first reading, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1353.819s">Mr.</a>  Clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=1355.621s">Please</a>  call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2508.774s">I</a>  really appreciate that council. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2510.255s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2510.955s">Cause</a>  it would really look wicked nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2515.31s">And</a>  year round, it won't be the Longfellow Bridge or the Salt and Pepper Bridge as they call it, but man, looking from the Karatek Bridge towards that lit up, shimmering river, it would be wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2529.814s">I</a>  wanted to push the envelope and confuse matters worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2533.435s">The</a>  Karatek Bridge was built in 1634, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2541.049s">It</a>  was recently rebuilt before Carol's went out of business. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2546.794s">And</a>  I was told, you can see the year as you're going out of the square over the bridge and through the woods, that was the bridge, I'm sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2557.983s">Not</a>  the footbridge, but it's all granite. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2562.786s">I'm</a>  sure it's been redone that bridge at least five times. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2566.169s">I</a>  believe it was a footbridge at first and it was a drawbridge <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2570.188s">and</a>  it was a toll bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2571.728s">So</a>  we made the Beacon Hill people pay the toll in order to go to the fells. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2577.549s">Very</a>  interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2578.99s">So</a>  someone told me it's the first bridge in the USA. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2581.19s">I</a>  started thinking, wait a minute, USA was 1776. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2585.411s">This</a>  is 1634. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2588.511s">So</a>  it must be the first bridge in 13 colonies. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2592.152s">So</a>  I'm presuming it might be the first bridge in all of North America.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2596.633s">It</a>  was definitely the first bridge over the Mystic.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2600.123s">And,</a>  you know, this, I mean, I don't wanna push the envelope. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2603.486s">I'm</a>  trying to get these heavy duty, well-built Christmas lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2608.53s">They</a>  shouldn't cost more than $100. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2609.571s">And</a>  what can they afford more than paying for six packages of cigarettes? <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2615.116s">That's</a>  16.50 a wack. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2617.338s">So</a>  the point is, this is not rocket science. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2620.0s">It's</a>  very doable. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2621.622s">And</a>  there'll be thousands of people that would appreciate this.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2627.242s">So,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2628.943s">I</a>  think it's appropriate that I leave the check with my letter that I hope you forward to the mayor as a council president you meet with him frequently, and it's appropriate that I leave it on the same messages desk.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2640.228s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2641.168s">Yes,</a>  I appreciate the gesture to Larry. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2644.33s">We</a>  miss him every day, and we will figure out how to do it I just appreciate you bringing it in the form of a check and not cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2652.893s">So</a>  that that helps.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2655.376s">I</a>  have to save my cash for the real estate tax bills now. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2660.282s">Thank</a>  you for listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2662.685s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2672.287s">just</a>  when I thought I was out. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2674.088s">I'm</a>  gonna go to Councilor Callahan who has requested the microphone. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2677.59s">Councilor</a>  Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2678.951s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2679.691s">I</a>  so appreciate this, the thought, the gesture. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2684.294s">I</a>  actually went on Amazon and found some solar floodlights that are like either white or multicolored that cost around a hundred bucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2691.457s">So</a>  I think this is something that we could easily make happen pretty quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2695.58s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2696.44s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2697.22s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2698.921s">Any</a>  further participation in the public participation section of the meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2702.83s">I'm</a>  going to go to Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2704.111s">We</a>  have Eunice Browne on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2705.411s">Eunice,</a>  name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2708.533s">Hi,</a>  Eunice Browne, Greenleaf Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2711.115s">Just</a>  a quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2712.555s">I</a>  noticed on the calendar tomorrow when I emailed a couple of times about this and didn't get a reply, but there's a regular city council meeting at seven tomorrow night with the agenda item from the mayor, the appropriations from the override. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2729.276s">Is</a>  that still being held and how is that different from what you guys just did a few minutes ago? <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2736.804s">And</a>  second quick question, have you guys received yet from the mayor the work from the charter commission, the charter that we wrote and the report?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2753.873s">Hi</a>  Eunice. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2755.175s">On</a>  the second question we have not yet received the report from the Charter Commission I think it's expected towards the end of the month or the beginning of next month. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2763.526s">for</a>  tomorrow night. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2765.127s">I</a>  honestly was unsure as to what was going to happen with the paper tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2769.508s">So</a>  I didn't know if there'd be a lot of discussion about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2771.229s">I</a>  didn't know if we'd want to move to another meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2773.57s">I</a>  didn't know if there may be a motion to table. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2776.05s">So</a>  that's why we have the two meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2779.051s">We</a>  approved it and it's been disposed with tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2780.992s">So</a>  I don't expect that we will have the regular meeting tomorrow night, but we will have the committee of the whole on the tree ordinance at six o'clock.</p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2788.895s">Okay,</a>  terrific. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2789.795s">Thanks</a>  very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2790.375s">Have</a>  a good night.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2792.236s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2796.656s">If</a>  anyone else would like to participate, please approach the podium or raise your hand on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2805.819s">Seeing</a>  none, on the motion to adjourn by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2810.06s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2818.843s">Councilor</a>  Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2820.823s">Vice</a>  President Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2822.144s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2823.604s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2824.285s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk5kVycceTI&t=2828.004s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>
