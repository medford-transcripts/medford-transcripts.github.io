6
00:06:08,217 --> 00:06:32,944
Reports of committees 2 4 0 3 3 offered by Vice President Collins planning and permitting committee November 13 2024 report to follow Vice President Collins. Thank you, President bears and I'd also like to thank Vice Chair of the committee Matt lemming for chairing this meeting on my behalf at this meeting. The draft proposal for the green score ordinance was reviewed by the committee and reported out to a regular session. Thank you. I move to approve.

7
00:06:35,384 --> 00:07:05,009
Thank you on the motion to approve the committee report by Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Lemming. Mr. Clerk, please call the roll. Councilor Callahan? Vice President Collins? Yes.

8
00:07:05,282 --> 00:07:33,166
This is the aforementioned amendment to the zoning ordinance for the Green Score for referral to the Community Development Board. The purpose of the Green Score is to provide flexibility in meeting environmental performance standards, promote attractive environmentally functional landscapes, strengthen climate adaptive goals established in the Climate Action and Adaptation Plan released in 2022 by improving flood resilience, heat mitigation, storm infiltration, and water, air, and soil quality,

9
00:07:33,558 --> 00:07:42,841
And to offer a many free ecosystem services, including mitigation of pollution shade and energy savings recreational opportunities and enhance property values and quality of life.

10
00:07:43,131 --> 00:08:07,739
As this was discussed in planning and permitting committee right now, this will only apply if approved to the Mystic Avenue Corridor District, which is currently under consideration by the Community Development Board. And as further zoning amendments move through, the green score would be added. But also right now applies to, I'm sorry,

11
00:08:08,012 --> 00:08:32,227
construction of new principal buildings or major renovations in FEMA flood hazard layer zones or projects that require site plan review. Any further discussion? Councilor Sang. I'll be brief. This is something that I campaigned on in the last election, something that I think a lot of other

12
00:08:32,688 --> 00:08:47,944
folks here behind the rail supported. I am particularly excited about this proposal because I think this is the perfect intersection between strengthening our climate goals and making it easier to develop and build here in the city within a scope

13
00:08:47,944 --> 00:09:17,329
of livability. I think this really prioritizes the experience of living here and making sure that our growth as it continues really reflects the city that we want to be, the sustainable Medford that we seek to be. It's very much in line with our open space plans, with our climate action and adaptation plans, and just something I'm very excited for. So I want to thank the committee. I want to thank Innis Associates.

14
00:09:17,329 --> 00:09:43,097
and I would motion for approval or to send this to the CD board. On the motion of councilor saying to refer to community development board seconded by councilor Callahan. Any further discussion? Seeing none, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll. Councilor Callahan? Vice President Collins? Yes. Councilor Lozano?

15
00:09:46,288 --> 00:10:13,473
second. President bears. Yes, 70 affirmative. None of the negative. The motion passes and the zoning amendment is referred to the Community Development Board. Communications from the mayor 24494 submitted by Mayor Brianna Lugo Kern Riverside Plaza P. A. R. C. Grant loan order and C. P. C. Appropriation approval request. Dear President bears and members of the City Council. I'm excited to share that the city has been awarded $198,853

16
00:10:13,985 --> 00:10:40,196
for the Parkland Acquisitions and Renovations for Communities Park Grant for the Riverside Plaza Improvements Project. The City's Community Preservation Committee is also recommending an appropriation of CPA funds in the amount of $144,250 for a total project cost of $343,103. The park grant requires that the City Council pass a resolution accepting the grant and acknowledging the restrictions to this space slash project for providing recreation purposes.

17
00:10:41,220 --> 00:11:11,186
The grant also requires that full funding for the projects be appropriated upon acceptance of the grant. The enclosed resolution addresses these requirements. The grant will then reimburse a $198,853 portion of the appropriation. In summary, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body adopt the enclosed resolution to accept the grant and authorize a loan order request of $198,853 for the project, which will be reimbursed by the park grant. Park grant requires a copy of certified vote sent to them by December 31st.

18
00:11:11,561 --> 00:11:36,800
and I hope these requests have been submitted with sufficient time for review. Sincerely, Brianna Lungokern, Mayor. So we have the resolution language here. We do have a letter from KP Law indicating that the loan order is prepared and loan order is authorized and in the correct form, properly granting the treasurer with the approval of the mayor.

19
00:11:37,176 --> 00:12:01,254
the authority to issue the bonds for the city. And that has been reviewed by Bond Council. And we also have here a letter from the Community Preservation Committee requesting that we requesting and recommending that we approve the CPC appropriation. And I believe we have Amanda Centrella here as well as Teresa DuPont. So I will let Amanda present anything else that you'd like to present.

20
00:12:04,121 --> 00:12:28,695
you. Thank you, President bears. Um, I have a brief presentation available if counselors are interested in seeing it just to illustrate what this project is about. But I also respect want to respect your time. So if you're interested, sure, we'll take a quick presentation. Great. Um, I think we need to make you a co host. Yes, please. Thank you. One second.

21
00:12:48,046 --> 00:13:06,476
Great. So I'm Amanda Centrella. I work with the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability. Thank you so much for having me. And I want to talk briefly about Riverside Plaza.

22
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:26,169
So just a summary about this project. We think that this plaza is a beautiful space. It was renovated in, I believe, 2018. And something that we've observed over the past year and a half is that while it is used very heavily during the shoulder seasons of the year,

23
00:13:26,169 --> 00:13:46,544
In the summer, it gets too hot to use comfortably for large chunks of the day because there isn't much shade over the actual patio of the plaza. There are some adjacent mature trees on lawn that's next to the plaza. Kind of over here.

24
00:13:47,227 --> 00:14:03,131
And oftentimes, folks will understandably drag tables and chairs underneath there to make use of that shade during the day. And it is really lovely. I've done the same. But as you can see, let's look at.

25
00:14:04,445 --> 00:14:33,985
this picture, there isn't an accessible route to this shaded area. And the lawn that's there isn't really lawn anymore because it's heavily trafficked. So there isn't an accessible way to use this shaded space. So this project proposes to put a floating deck over that portion of the lawn, which will accomplish a couple of things. It creates an accessible route to that shaded space,

26
00:14:33,985 --> 00:14:53,166
And it protects the tree roots and the root systems there in soil from erosion. So the deck would allow for water to infiltrate, creates an accessible route, and just keeps things kind of looking nice over there as well. In addition, sorry, I keep skipping around.

27
00:14:54,735 --> 00:15:08,097
In addition, we are proposing to put a couple of shade sails in the patio area of the plaza to make that gorgeous space more usable during the hottest part of the year and sunny days.

28
00:15:09,497 --> 00:15:28,490
See, so just a little bit of a close up on where those are located in that patio existing patio area and here's a rendering to kind of get a better picture. We wouldn't you know encapsulate the entire patio space, because it is nice to have sunny spaces as well, but just creating some areas for shade.

29
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:53,558
And in this picture, you can see roughly where we're talking about for the decking area. There is the sidewalk here and an existing pathway that runs up to this area where there's like a little stage. And then from there, an accessible ramp that goes up at a gradual slope to this decked area. And you can see there's some space around each of the existing trees there.

30
00:15:57,125 --> 00:16:25,674
And here's a rendering of, you know, in concept what that deck could look like. A couple of other things that this project includes would be a water bottle, a water filling station. As part of our climate action and adaptation plan, one of the priorities there is to have, create more hubs where there's cool spaces in public spaces, and water is an important feature of that.

31
00:16:25,674 --> 00:16:54,104
have a little bit of additional lighting in the style of the, um, existing, uh, lights that are there. And just a quick breakdown of the funding. So we applied for this park grant, which is a through a state program through the executive Office of Environmental Affairs, and we were awarded and roughly $199,000

32
00:16:54,565 --> 00:17:22,176
Um, we have been before the Community Preservation Committee, and Teresa will talk a little bit more about that. But for that required match funding for a total of around $343,000 for this project. So that's just a rough overview, and I would welcome questions. Thank you. Do we have questions for Amanda, or do we want to hear from Teresa first?

33
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:46,852
Teresa, is there anything you'd like to add? I was just going to add that this was a project that has been bantered about in our outreach with residents. A lot of residents have commented wanting to see this type of improvement at the site. So the CPC unanimously and heartily supported this project. Just wanted to add that for some color. Thank you. All right. We'll go to Councilor Callahan and then Councilor Scarpelli.

34
00:17:48,643 --> 00:18:14,633
Thank you. So I noticed that there are some younger trees. So the two areas where there will be sunshades, the left one and then the lower one. Near the lower one, it seems like there are some younger trees. And I'm just curious if you anticipate that at the point where those trees become larger, that this is sort of something for the next 10 years that these sunshades will be really helpful and that hopefully those trees will then provide more shade there.

35
00:18:14,633 --> 00:18:29,667
Absolutely. So those trees are about 20 years out from being able to provide basically maturing to their full size and being able to provide shade to that area and augmenting shade over there. So you're absolutely right.

36
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:50,162
these shade cells are acting as sort of an interim tool for creating some shade. Awesome. Is that the same on the left? I don't really see a younger tree there, but... I think the younger trees are kind of on this area where there's some picnic tables over there, and not so much on this right hand side. Yeah.

37
00:18:50,520 --> 00:19:19,735
Any thoughts of like planting a tree in the south side so that eventually it will shade that area as well if that's something that we think is necessary long-term? I know it's not in this project, but I just thought I would mention it. No, it's a great suggestion. There are some plantings over here and landscaping over here that are existing, but it's absolutely something we could explore. And I think, let's see, I think we have some shade studies here.

38
00:19:22,142 --> 00:19:41,903
I didn't. I don't think so. So these are conceptual drawings. At this point, we haven't done final design. Final design will be incorporated once we have access to this funding. And so we could look at, you know, what are some options to extend the beauty and also tree canopy of the space.

39
00:19:46,578 --> 00:20:07,688
Thank you. Go to Councilor Scarpelli. Thank you, Council President. Thank you for the presentation. I think this is such a welcoming addition. I think that especially when you hear some of the bantering of the negativity of the pop-up park and the parking lot where there's no shade, there's nothing that really attracts

40
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:32,688
families to that area in the concept that we're seeing here. So I think this really fills a gap in Medford Square. I think this is something I'll support 1,000%. The question I had is I know that we've had residents that made that the chess hub of the world, it seemed, right? So I know one resident worked very hard

41
00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:40,930
I know that the tables there, the chest tables and those coverings going to be able to shade those areas.

42
00:20:42,022 --> 00:21:05,162
Let's see. Yeah, so there are a lot of mobile tables that are in and around this plaza area. And these are just, as I mentioned, these are just conceptual design. So we could ensure that any of the permanent tables there with the chess board on top of them could be covered.

43
00:21:05,162 --> 00:21:33,456
If I can, if you can, just if you can reach out to the resident, I'll share his information. I'm sure you know it. Yeah. But if you can just, you know, even maybe get him involved in saying, okay, as you kind of built this area and really made it when people didn't know what it was going to be used for, he kind of made it a home for families and kids that really needed an area to meet. So I think that it was, it was a great vision and great opportunity for us. So I appreciate all your hard work and I

44
00:21:33,814 --> 00:21:36,374
I think this is going to be great. So thank you. Thank you.

45
00:21:44,019 --> 00:22:12,551
Just one other comment that I really appreciate how much, I'm always impressed with how much our city administration looks for grants. And just so that people know, grants often come with this kind of requirement where there's the grant, but then they also require the city to put in funds that are sort of roughly equivalent. So I really appreciate the work on that front. Thank you. Thank you. All right, anything else you'd like to add? Great.

46
00:22:13,063 --> 00:22:42,466
So we're going to take two votes here. First, we need to take a vote on the loan order and the resolution to accept the grant. That means three readings, and then we can vote on the community preservation committee appropriation request. So is there a motion on the loan order to approve for first reading? On the motion of councilor saying to approve for first reading, seconded by Councilor Lozaro. Mr. Clerk. Please call the roll. I also accept the grant, correct?

Communications from city officers and employees 24495 submitted by director of traffic and transportation Todd Blake authorization of future blue bikes contract exceeding three years to Medford City Council from Todd Blake director of traffic and transportation. Sorry, authorization of future blue bikes contract exceeding three years

66
00:30:42,995 --> 00:30:53,507
This memorandum summarizes the request to authorize a future contract as required by section 12 of chapter 30 be the general laws, the city's contract with lift the operator blue blue bikes will expire in fall 2025.

67
00:30:54,138 --> 00:31:20,538
The Metropolitan Area Planning Council intends to issue a request for proposals on behalf of all the municipalities that are part of the Blue Bike system to select a new operator in 2025. MAPC will select one operator to manage the entire system to ensure that it continues to operate regionally. Each municipality will then have the opportunity to contract with the selected operator separately or enter into a joint contract. It is the intention of Blue Bikes municipalities to enter into a five-year contract with two two-year options to renew with the future operator.

68
00:31:20,981 --> 00:31:46,203
entering into a longer-term contract will encourage the future operator to provide a higher level of service to users and help secure more funding through the system's title sponsorship, which will then allow the service to continue growing throughout the region. And I'm not gonna read the rest if folks don't mind me reading the legalese on chapter 30B. All right. I think we're good. I'm gonna go to director Todd Blake.

69
00:31:48,865 --> 00:32:05,759
As some others have mentioned, I'm just here for questions. I think the memo is self-explanatory. Thank you, Todd. I will go to Vice President Collins.

70
00:32:07,363 --> 00:32:30,401
Thank you, President Behrs. I just wanted to quickly thank Director Blake and his team for their work with Blue Bikes here to for in the city. And I understand that this requested contract extension is part of a kind of coordinated regional effort so that not just an effort, but that in more of our adjacent communities, people can have an easier time.

71
00:32:30,401 --> 00:32:58,763
the bike share network and using that not only to get in and around Medford, but to surrounding communities and back for play and for commuting and for other purposes. So I'm happy to be a part of the effort of streamlining that process in Medford and beyond, and I would motion to approve. Thank you. Thank you. And just FYI, we're having some audio issues with your audio, Vice President Collins. Todd sounded fine, right?

72
00:33:00,299 --> 00:33:25,640
Yeah, might be on your end, Vice President Collins. Vice President Collins has motion to approve. Is there any, is there a second? Second by Councilor Sang. Is there any further discussion? Seeing none, Councilor Zaro. I would like to echo what Vice President Collins was saying about

73
00:33:26,271 --> 00:33:54,872
Thanking director Blake for his work on this. I, the more blue bikes we are getting into the city, the better. I just would encourage this council to continue to look at how we can increase the safety of biking infrastructure in the city as we, as we go into these kinds of processes. Thank you. Thank you. Director Blake, is there anything you want to share relative to bike safety infrastructure as related to blue bikes or otherwise?

74
00:33:56,613 --> 00:34:17,210
Yeah, thank you. I appreciate the kind words. Yeah, we've successfully expanded the system from three stations just two years ago to now 15. And as a region, we just broke a record with the most rides ever with over 4 million rides this past year, this current year, I mean, 2024.

75
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:46,049
So we're trying to keep up with adding bicycle infrastructure as you could probably see from some recent efforts just this past week or two on College Ave, Salem Street and Main Street. So we're trying to continue our efforts to make safe connections from major points of interest like the Green Line and Medford Square and other points of interest like that. So hopefully we could keep pace with the expansion of the blue bikes and continue to provide additional bicycle infrastructure.

76
00:34:47,602 --> 00:35:17,056
Thanks. Thank you, Director Blake. Any further discussion? Seeing none, on the motion of Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Sang, is that right? Mr. Clerk, please call the roll. Councilor Callahan? Yes. Vice President Collins? Yes. Councilor Lozaro? Yes. Councilor Lemming? Yes.

77
00:35:18,166 --> 00:35:44,616
Councilor Seng? Yes. President Behrs? Yes. Having the affirmative and the negative, the motion passes. The last things that we had, we have a public participation item from Andrew Castagnetti. And thank you, Director Blake. And we did have the tabled item regarding the crew team. I'm thinking maybe we should just table both of them to the next regular meeting.

78
00:35:45,179 --> 00:36:14,855
Yeah. Crew team's already tabled. All right, crew team's tabled, so we'll put that back on the next regular meeting agenda. And then is there a motion to table Mr. Castaneda's public participation item for the next regular meeting? On the motion to table the public participation item from the gentleman from East Med Ford by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Lemming.

79
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:41,613
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll. Councilor Kellyanne. Vice President Collins. Yes. Councilor Lazaro. Yes. Councilor Lemming. Yes. Councilor Scarpelli. Yes. Councilor Sang. Yes. President Behrs. Yes. Seven in favor of the negative, the motion is tabled. Any further discussion? All in

80
00:36:43,370 --> 00:37:05,418
If you would like to participate in public, please raise your hand on Zoom or in person. Is he walking up? I thought he just walked past. Andy, we just tabled your item. We're almost done. Do you want to speak tonight? You're a little late. We'll take you.

81
00:37:06,305 --> 00:37:29,735
Motion to take the paper off the table from Mr. Cassidy by Councilor lemming seconded by Councilor Callahan. One second Mr. Clerk please call the roll. We just need to, we have to vote to bring it back.

82
00:37:39,036 --> 00:38:06,817
Councilor Callahan, we're in a roll call. Yes. Vice President Collins. Yes. Councilor Lozaro. Yes. Councilor Lemmon. Yes. Councilor Scarpelli. Yes. Councilor Seng. Yes. President Beers. Yes. I mean, if everyone's done the negative, the motion passes. Mr. Cassidy, name and address for the record. Take your time, but the quicker you do it, the better it is. That's what's important. Anyways, he must've knew me.

83
00:38:07,568 --> 00:38:35,060
Thank you, Council President. Andrew Castanetti, Cushing Street, Medford, Massachusetts. My request to the city council, I brought this up a few months ago with $100 cash, but you become a scared, you told me to put the cash away. So I brought a check this time. I got the guy got rid of this licorice.

84
00:38:37,568 --> 00:39:07,073
You don't want to smell my cigarettes. Please see my check, my donation for $100, check number 742. I want this to go forward to light up the Karatek Bridge, the Mystic River footbridge over the Mystic River in memory of Lawrence Larry Lepore.

85
00:39:08,353 --> 00:39:35,486
He is well loved by many with this 37 year city employment history. This historic footbridge is the best existential landmark in Medford, Massachusetts. And it would be really cool to see the lights shimmering on a river year round. I'm hoping this beautification

86
00:39:35,930 --> 00:40:04,445
will be done before the holidays. Thank you for listening, Andrew P. Castanete. P.S. I've enclosed a photo of the Mystic River footbridge taken by your mom, Mr. President, Mrs. Beers. I met her at the West Bedford Open Studio. She had a booth. And it's a beautiful photograph.

87
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:32,534
I'm keeping the original, but it's part of the copy I'm gonna give you along with the check. Also, please submit my request and check to the Mayor, City Mayor, Mayor Brianna. And if you have any questions or comments, I do appreciate it, because I walked the bridge a few times, I checked out the two,

88
00:40:32,978 --> 00:40:57,654
electric poles on both ends of the bridge. They're within spitting distance. They're like four or five feet away from both sides of the bridge. So I think it would look really cool. And if I wanted to use some Boston vernacular, it would look pisser. Wicked pisser. Thank you for correcting me.

89
00:40:58,029 --> 00:41:25,742
So if you have any questions or comments, I appreciate it. I seem to know a lot about this. So do you have any questions or comments? Thank you. Do we have any questions? Councilor Scarpelli. But I know, you know, this is such a great gesture. It's exactly your heart. And we appreciate that because you know what it does.

90
00:41:26,647 --> 00:41:54,616
I don't think we'll ever forget Larry, but just a little symbol to keep Larry's light alive. I think this is a great fitting tribute. So thank you for that idea. And I think that if there is something that if we need to make sure that happens and look for some other alternative funding, I think that we as a council should try to find some other avenues to make sure that that happens. I think that'd be a great gesture. I really appreciate that council. Thank you. Cause it would really look wicked nice.

91
00:41:55,230 --> 00:42:19,377
And year round, it won't be the Longfellow Bridge or the Salt and Pepper Bridge as they call it, but man, looking from the Karatek Bridge towards that lit up, shimmering river, it would be wonderful. I wanted to push the envelope and confuse matters worse. The Karatek Bridge was built in 1634, I believe.

92
00:42:21,049 --> 00:42:49,872
It was recently rebuilt before Carol's went out of business. And I was told, you can see the year as you're going out of the square over the bridge and through the woods, that was the bridge, I'm sure. Not the footbridge, but it's all granite. I'm sure it's been redone that bridge at least five times. I believe it was a footbridge at first and it was a drawbridge

93
00:42:50,128 --> 00:43:18,473
and it was a toll bridge. So we made the Beacon Hill people pay the toll in order to go to the fells. Very interesting. So someone told me it's the first bridge in the USA. I started thinking, wait a minute, USA was 1776. This is 1634. So it must be the first bridge in 13 colonies. So I'm presuming it might be the first bridge in all of North America. It was definitely the first bridge over the Mystic.

94
00:43:19,923 --> 00:43:45,725
And, you know, this, I mean, I don't wanna push the envelope. I'm trying to get these heavy duty, well-built Christmas lights. They shouldn't cost more than $100. And what can they afford more than paying for six packages of cigarettes? That's 16.50 a wack. So the point is, this is not rocket science. It's very doable. And there'll be thousands of people that would appreciate this.

95
00:43:47,142 --> 00:44:12,073
So, thank you. I think it's appropriate that I leave the check with my letter that I hope you forward to the mayor as a council president you meet with him frequently, and it's appropriate that I leave it on the same messages desk. Thank you. Yes, I appreciate the gesture to Larry. We miss him every day, and we will figure out how to do it I just appreciate you bringing it in the form of a check and not cash.

96
00:44:12,773 --> 00:44:27,090
So that that helps. I have to save my cash for the real estate tax bills now. Thank you for listening. Thank you.

97
00:44:32,227 --> 00:45:01,903
just when I thought I was out. I'm gonna go to Councilor Callahan who has requested the microphone. Councilor Callahan. Thank you. I so appreciate this, the thought, the gesture. I actually went on Amazon and found some solar floodlights that are like either white or multicolored that cost around a hundred bucks. So I think this is something that we could easily make happen pretty quickly. Thank you. All right. Any further discussion? Any further participation in the public participation section of the meeting?

98
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:28,404
I'm going to go to Zoom. We have Eunice Brown on Zoom. Eunice, name and address for the record, please. Hi, Eunice Brown, Greenleaf Ave. Just a quick question. I noticed on the calendar tomorrow when I emailed a couple of times about this and didn't get a reply, but there's a regular city council meeting at seven tomorrow night with the agenda item from the mayor, the appropriations from the override.

99
00:45:28,916 --> 00:45:52,159
Is that still being held and how is that different from what you guys just did a few minutes ago? And second quick question, have you guys received yet from the mayor the work from the charter commission, the charter that we wrote and the report?

100
00:45:53,473 --> 00:46:02,381
Hi units. On the second question we have not yet received the report from the Charter Commission I think it's expected towards the end of the month or the beginning of next month.

101
00:46:03,046 --> 00:46:32,756
for tomorrow night. I honestly was unsure as to what was going to happen with the paper tonight. So I didn't know if there'd be a lot of discussion about it. I didn't know if we'd want to move to another meeting. I didn't know if there may be a motion to table. So that's why we have the two meetings. We approved it and it's been disposed with tonight. So I don't expect that we will have the regular meeting tomorrow night, but we will have the committee of the whole on the tree ordinance at six o'clock. Okay, terrific. Thanks very much. Have a good night. Thank you.

102
00:46:36,596 --> 00:47:05,845
If anyone else would like to participate, please approach the podium or raise your hand on Zoom. Seeing none, on the motion to adjourn by Councillor Scarpelli, seconded by Councillor Lazzaro. Mr. Clerk, please call the roll. Councillor Kallian. Vice President Collins. Yes. Councillor Lazzaro. Yes.

103
00:47:07,824 --> 00:47:21,493
