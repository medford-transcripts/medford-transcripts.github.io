00:07:57,116 --> 00:08:01,137
[SPEAKER_10]: And as further zoning amendments move through, the green score would be added.

[SPEAKER_09]: I'll be brief.

64
00:08:25,623 --> 00:08:31,206
[SPEAKER_09]: This is something that I campaigned on in the last election, something that I think a lot of other

65
00:08:32,728 --> 00:08:34,390
[SPEAKER_09]: folks here behind the rail supported.

66
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:47,664
[SPEAKER_09]: I am particularly excited about this proposal because I think this is the perfect intersection between strengthening our climate goals and making it easier to develop and build here in the city within a scope

67
00:08:48,164 --> 00:08:48,864
[SPEAKER_09]: of livability.

68
00:08:48,884 --> 00:09:03,207
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this really prioritizes the experience of living here and making sure that our growth as it continues really reflects the city that we want to be, the sustainable Medford that we seek to be.

69
00:09:04,147 --> 00:09:13,248
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very much in line with our open space plans, with our climate action and adaptation plans, and just something I'm very excited for.

70
00:09:13,488 --> 00:09:14,709
[SPEAKER_09]: So I want to thank the committee.

71
00:09:14,749 --> 00:09:16,009

90
00:10:30,392 --> 00:10:39,916
[SPEAKER_10]: The park grant requires that the City Council pass a resolution accepting the grant and acknowledging the restrictions to this space slash project for providing recreation purposes.

92

93
00:10:48,401 --> 00:10:53,382

[SPEAKER_10]: Sincerely, Brianna Lungokern, Mayor.

98
00:11:17,706 --> 00:11:19,707
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have the resolution language here.

99
00:11:22,109 --> 00:11:36,580
[SPEAKER_10]: We do have a letter from KP Law indicating that the loan order is prepared and loan order is authorized and in the correct form, properly granting the treasurer with the approval of the mayor.

100
00:11:37,256 --> 00:11:39,037

[SPEAKER_10]: And that has been reviewed by Bond Council.

107
00:12:07,303 --> 00:12:15,588
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, I have a brief presentation available if counselors are interested in seeing it just to illustrate what this project is about.

[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

00:12:28,075 --> 00:12:28,535
[SPEAKER_10]: One second.

115
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:56,310
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

116
00:12:56,551 --> 00:12:58,312
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm Amanda Centrella.

117
00:12:58,352 --> 00:13:01,413
[SPEAKER_12]: I work with the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability.

118
00:13:01,533 --> 00:13:02,774
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much for having me.

119
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:06,036
[SPEAKER_12]: And I want to talk briefly about Riverside Plaza.

120
00:13:07,449 --> 00:13:09,511
[SPEAKER_12]: So just a summary about this project.

121
00:13:10,693 --> 00:13:13,395
[SPEAKER_12]: We think that this plaza is a beautiful space.

122
00:13:13,556 --> 00:13:15,998
[SPEAKER_12]: It was renovated in, I believe, 2018.

123
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:25,929
[SPEAKER_12]: And something that we've observed over the past year and a half is that while it is used very heavily during the shoulder seasons of the year,

124
00:13:26,689 --> 00:13:38,178
[SPEAKER_12]: In the summer, it gets too hot to use comfortably for large chunks of the day because there isn't much shade over the actual patio of the plaza.

125
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:44,422
[SPEAKER_12]: There are some adjacent mature trees on lawn that's next to the plaza.

126
00:13:44,442 --> 00:13:46,424
[SPEAKER_12]: Kind of over here.

127
00:13:47,387 --> 00:13:54,838
[SPEAKER_12]: And oftentimes, folks will understandably drag tables and chairs underneath there to make use of that shade during the day.

128
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:55,920
[SPEAKER_12]: And it is really lovely.

129
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:56,902
[SPEAKER_12]: I've done the same.

130
00:13:58,344 --> 00:14:02,911
[SPEAKER_12]: But as you can see, let's look at.

131
00:14:04,485 --> 00:14:09,588
[SPEAKER_12]: this picture, there isn't an accessible route to this shaded area.

132
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:14,972
[SPEAKER_12]: And the lawn that's there isn't really lawn anymore because it's heavily trafficked.

133
00:14:15,993 --> 00:14:20,036
[SPEAKER_12]: So there isn't an accessible way to use this shaded space.

134
00:14:20,656 --> 00:14:30,042
[SPEAKER_12]: So this project proposes to put a floating deck over that portion of the lawn, which will accomplish a couple of things.

135
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:33,625
[SPEAKER_12]: It creates an accessible route to that shaded space,

136
00:14:34,486 --> 00:14:39,291
[SPEAKER_12]: And it protects the tree roots and the root systems there in soil from erosion.

137
00:14:39,591 --> 00:14:48,301
[SPEAKER_12]: So the deck would allow for water to infiltrate, creates an accessible route, and just keeps things kind of looking nice over there as well.

138
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:53,026
[SPEAKER_12]: In addition, sorry, I keep skipping around.

139
00:14:54,795 --> 00:15:06,975
[SPEAKER_12]: In addition, we are proposing to put a couple of shade sails in the patio area of the plaza to make that gorgeous space more usable during the hottest part of the year and sunny days.

140
00:15:09,517 --> 00:15:18,723
[SPEAKER_12]: See, so just a little bit of a close up on where those are located in that patio existing patio area and here's a rendering to kind of get a better picture.

141
00:15:20,324 --> 00:15:28,430
[SPEAKER_12]: We wouldn't you know encapsulate the entire patio space, because it is nice to have sunny spaces as well, but just creating some areas for shade.

142
00:15:31,844 --> 00:15:36,407
[SPEAKER_12]: And in this picture, you can see roughly where we're talking about for the decking area.

143
00:15:37,528 --> 00:15:43,892
[SPEAKER_12]: There is the sidewalk here and an existing pathway that runs up to this area where there's like a little stage.

144
00:15:44,512 --> 00:15:50,336
[SPEAKER_12]: And then from there, an accessible ramp that goes up at a gradual slope to this decked area.

145
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:53,418
[SPEAKER_12]: And you can see there's some space around each of the existing trees there.

146
00:15:57,165 --> 00:16:01,586
[SPEAKER_12]: And here's a rendering of, you know, in concept what that deck could look like.

147
00:16:05,308 --> 00:16:11,209
[SPEAKER_12]: A couple of other things that this project includes would be a water bottle, a water filling station.

148
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:25,454
[SPEAKER_12]: As part of our climate action and adaptation plan, one of the priorities there is to have, create more hubs where there's cool spaces in public spaces, and water is an important feature of that.

149
00:16:26,454 --> 00:16:37,858
[SPEAKER_12]: have a little bit of additional lighting in the style of the, um, existing, uh, lights that are there.

150
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:42,240
[SPEAKER_12]: And just a quick breakdown of the funding.

151
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:52,023
[SPEAKER_12]: So we applied for this park grant, which is a through a state program through the executive Office of Environmental Affairs, and we were awarded and roughly $199,000

152
00:16:54,785 --> 00:17:01,648
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, we have been before the Community Preservation Committee, and Teresa will talk a little bit more about that.

153
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:10,912
[SPEAKER_12]: But for that required match funding for a total of around $343,000 for this project.

154
00:17:14,393 --> 00:17:17,334
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's just a rough overview, and I would welcome questions.

155
00:17:18,555 --> 00:17:19,035
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

156
00:17:19,055 --> 00:17:21,876
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we have questions for Amanda, or do we want to hear from Teresa first?

157
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:24,531
[SPEAKER_10]: Teresa, is there anything you'd like to add?

158
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:32,118
[SPEAKER_14]: I was just going to add that this was a project that has been bantered about in our outreach with residents.

159
00:17:32,158 --> 00:17:36,102
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of residents have commented wanting to see this type of improvement at the site.

160
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:40,746
[SPEAKER_14]: So the CPC unanimously and heartily supported this project.

161
00:17:40,786 --> 00:17:42,208
[SPEAKER_14]: Just wanted to add that for some color.

162
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:43,249
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

163
00:17:43,269 --> 00:17:44,149
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

164
00:17:44,169 --> 00:17:46,712
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll go to Councilor Callahan and then Councilor Scarpelli.

165
00:17:48,663 --> 00:17:49,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

166
00:17:49,883 --> 00:17:52,745
[SPEAKER_02]: So I noticed that there are some younger trees.

167
00:17:53,185 --> 00:17:56,926
[SPEAKER_02]: So the two areas where there will be sunshades, the left one and then the lower one.

168
00:17:57,306 --> 00:17:59,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Near the lower one, it seems like there are some younger trees.

169
00:18:00,327 --> 00:18:14,153
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just curious if you anticipate that at the point where those trees become larger, that this is sort of something for the next 10 years that these sunshades will be really helpful and that hopefully those trees will then provide more shade there.

170
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:15,894
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely.

171
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:28,446
[SPEAKER_12]: So those trees are about 20 years out from being able to provide basically maturing to their full size and being able to provide shade to that area and augmenting shade over there.

172
00:18:28,526 --> 00:18:29,607
[SPEAKER_12]: So you're absolutely right.

173
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:35,626
[SPEAKER_12]: these shade cells are acting as sort of an interim tool for creating some shade.

174
00:18:36,287 --> 00:18:36,487
[SPEAKER_12]: Awesome.

175
00:18:36,507 --> 00:18:37,428
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that the same on the left?

176
00:18:38,049 --> 00:18:49,141
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't really see a younger tree there, but... I think the younger trees are kind of on this area where there's some picnic tables over there, and not so much on this right hand side.

177
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:50,122
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

178
00:18:50,820 --> 00:19:01,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Any thoughts of like planting a tree in the south side so that eventually it will shade that area as well if that's something that we think is necessary long-term?

179
00:19:02,986 --> 00:19:04,967
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's not in this project, but I just thought I would mention it.

180
00:19:05,148 --> 00:19:06,968
[SPEAKER_12]: No, it's a great suggestion.

181
00:19:07,749 --> 00:19:14,692
[SPEAKER_12]: There are some plantings over here and landscaping over here that are existing, but it's absolutely something we could explore.

182
00:19:15,893 --> 00:19:19,515
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think, let's see, I think we have some shade studies here.

183
00:19:22,342 --> 00:19:22,623
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't.

184
00:19:22,863 --> 00:19:23,564
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think so.

185
00:19:23,964 --> 00:19:26,106
[SPEAKER_12]: So these are conceptual drawings.

186
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,068
[SPEAKER_12]: At this point, we haven't done final design.

187
00:19:28,609 --> 00:19:32,813
[SPEAKER_12]: Final design will be incorporated once we have access to this funding.

188
00:19:34,135 --> 00:19:41,723
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we could look at, you know, what are some options to extend the beauty and also tree canopy of the space.

189
00:19:46,598 --> 00:19:46,898
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

190
00:19:46,938 --> 00:19:48,179
[SPEAKER_10]: Go to Councilor Scarpelli.

191
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:49,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Council President.

192
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for the presentation.

193
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:56,483
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is such a welcoming addition.

194
00:19:56,503 --> 00:20:07,208
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that especially when you hear some of the bantering of the negativity of the pop-up park and the parking lot where there's no shade, there's nothing that really attracts

195
00:20:08,513 --> 00:20:12,315
[SPEAKER_03]: families to that area in the concept that we're seeing here.

196
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:16,098
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think this really fills a gap in Medford Square.

197
00:20:16,138 --> 00:20:19,920
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is something I'll support 1,000%.

198
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:28,846
[SPEAKER_03]: The question I had is I know that we've had residents that made that the chess hub of the world, it seemed, right?

199
00:20:28,886 --> 00:20:31,707
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know one resident worked very hard

200
00:20:33,069 --> 00:20:40,750
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that the tables there, the chest tables and those coverings going to be able to shade those areas.

201
00:20:42,062 --> 00:20:42,643
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see.

202
00:20:42,863 --> 00:20:48,508
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, so there are a lot of mobile tables that are in and around this plaza area.

203
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:52,011
[SPEAKER_12]: And these are just, as I mentioned, these are just conceptual design.

204
00:20:52,851 --> 00:21:04,942
[SPEAKER_12]: So we could ensure that any of the permanent tables there with the chess board on top of them could be covered.

205
00:21:05,382 --> 00:21:09,524
[SPEAKER_03]: If I can, if you can, just if you can reach out to the resident, I'll share his information.

206
00:21:09,544 --> 00:21:10,164
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure you know it.

207
00:21:10,425 --> 00:21:10,625
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

208
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:27,653
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you can just, you know, even maybe get him involved in saying, okay, as you kind of built this area and really made it when people didn't know what it was going to be used for, he kind of made it a home for families and kids that really needed an area to meet.

209
00:21:27,733 --> 00:21:31,095
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that it was, it was a great vision and great opportunity for us.

210
00:21:31,135 --> 00:21:33,256
[SPEAKER_03]: So I appreciate all your hard work and I

211
00:21:33,874 --> 00:21:34,862
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is going to be great.

212
00:21:34,882 --> 00:21:35,386
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.

213
00:21:35,971 --> 00:21:36,233
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

214
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:51,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Just one other comment that I really appreciate how much, I'm always impressed with how much our city administration looks for grants.

215
00:21:52,723 --> 00:22:02,627
[SPEAKER_02]: And just so that people know, grants often come with this kind of requirement where there's the grant, but then they also require the city to put in funds that are sort of roughly equivalent.

216
00:22:03,527 --> 00:22:05,648
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really appreciate the work on that front.

217
00:22:06,268 --> 00:22:07,089
Thank you.

218
00:22:08,109 --> 00:22:08,469
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

219
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:10,630
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, anything else you'd like to add?

220
00:22:11,991 --> 00:22:12,231
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

221
00:22:13,163 --> 00:22:14,404
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're going to take two votes here.

222
00:22:15,205 --> 00:22:18,828
[SPEAKER_10]: First, we need to take a vote on the loan order and the resolution to accept the grant.

223
00:22:18,868 --> 00:22:23,711
[SPEAKER_10]: That means three readings, and then we can vote on the community preservation committee appropriation request.

224
00:22:24,372 --> 00:22:27,514
[SPEAKER_10]: So is there a motion on the loan order to approve for first reading?

225
00:22:28,475 --> 00:22:33,139
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion of councilor saying to approve for first reading, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.

[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

311
00:30:16,444 --> 00:30:17,585
[SPEAKER_10]: I have an affirmative and a negative.

312
00:30:17,605 --> 00:30:18,326
[SPEAKER_10]: The motion passes.

313
00:30:19,462 --> 00:30:34,095
[SPEAKER_10]: Communications from city officers and employees 24495 submitted by director of traffic and transportation Todd Blake authorization of future blue bikes contract exceeding three years to Medford City Council from Todd Blake director of traffic and transportation.

314
00:30:38,479 --> 00:30:41,742
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, authorization of future blue bikes contract exceeding three years

315
00:30:42,995 --> 00:30:52,566
[SPEAKER_10]: This memorandum summarizes the request to authorize a future contract as required by section 12 of chapter 30 be the general laws, the city's contract with lift the operator blue blue bikes will expire in fall 2025.

316
00:30:54,138 --> 00:31:02,524
[SPEAKER_10]: The Metropolitan Area Planning Council intends to issue a request for proposals on behalf of all the municipalities that are part of the Blue Bike system to select a new operator in 2025.

317
00:31:03,225 --> 00:31:07,808
[SPEAKER_10]: MAPC will select one operator to manage the entire system to ensure that it continues to operate regionally.

318
00:31:07,828 --> 00:31:13,653
[SPEAKER_10]: Each municipality will then have the opportunity to contract with the selected operator separately or enter into a joint contract.

319
00:31:14,573 --> 00:31:20,358
[SPEAKER_10]: It is the intention of Blue Bikes municipalities to enter into a five-year contract with two two-year options to renew with the future operator.

320
00:31:21,041 --> 00:31:32,171
[SPEAKER_10]: entering into a longer-term contract will encourage the future operator to provide a higher level of service to users and help secure more funding through the system's title sponsorship, which will then allow the service to continue growing throughout the region.

321
00:31:33,732 --> 00:31:38,416
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm not gonna read the rest if folks don't mind me reading the legalese on chapter 30B.

322
00:31:39,377 --> 00:31:39,637
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

323
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:42,620
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we're good.

324
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:46,063
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm gonna go to director Todd Blake.

325
00:31:49,486 --> 00:31:52,288
[SPEAKER_13]: As some others have mentioned, I'm just here for questions.

326
00:31:52,708 --> 00:31:55,210
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the memo is self-explanatory.

327
00:31:57,712 --> 00:31:58,233
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Todd.

328
00:32:03,958 --> 00:32:05,519
[SPEAKER_10]: I will go to Vice President Collins.

329
00:32:07,403 --> 00:32:08,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, President Behrs.

330
00:32:08,444 --> 00:32:17,571
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to quickly thank Director Blake and his team for their work with Blue Bikes here to for in the city.

331
00:32:17,731 --> 00:32:30,081
[SPEAKER_07]: And I understand that this requested contract extension is part of a kind of coordinated regional effort so that not just an effort, but that in more of our adjacent communities, people can have an easier time.

332
00:32:31,162 --> 00:32:39,988
[SPEAKER_07]: the bike share network and using that not only to get in and around Medford, but to surrounding communities and back for play and for commuting and for other purposes.

333
00:32:41,249 --> 00:32:47,895
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm happy to be a part of the effort of streamlining that process in Medford and beyond, and I would motion to approve.

334
00:32:48,215 --> 00:32:48,495
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

335
00:32:50,957 --> 00:32:51,357
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

336
00:32:51,377 --> 00:32:56,561
[SPEAKER_10]: And just FYI, we're having some audio issues with your audio, Vice President Collins.

337
00:32:57,722 --> 00:32:58,703
[SPEAKER_10]: Todd sounded fine, right?

338
00:33:00,379 --> 00:33:02,541
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, might be on your end, Vice President Collins.

339
00:33:04,102 --> 00:33:05,723
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Collins has motion to approve.

340
00:33:05,744 --> 00:33:07,105
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there any, is there a second?

341
00:33:08,065 --> 00:33:09,126
[SPEAKER_10]: Second by Councilor Sang.

342
00:33:09,146 --> 00:33:10,207
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there any further discussion?

343
00:33:15,432 --> 00:33:17,233
[SPEAKER_10]: Seeing none, Councilor Lazzaro.

344
00:33:20,876 --> 00:33:24,899
[SPEAKER_15]: I would like to echo what Vice President Collins was saying about

345
00:33:26,331 --> 00:33:29,053
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanking director Blake for his work on this.

346
00:33:30,374 --> 00:33:33,897
[SPEAKER_15]: I, the more blue bikes we are getting into the city, the better.

347
00:33:33,917 --> 00:33:46,826
[SPEAKER_15]: I just would encourage this council to continue to look at how we can increase the safety of biking infrastructure in the city as we, as we go into these kinds of processes.

348
00:33:47,487 --> 00:33:47,767
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

349
00:33:48,367 --> 00:33:48,848
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

350
00:33:49,308 --> 00:33:54,772
[SPEAKER_10]: Director Blake, is there anything you want to share relative to bike safety infrastructure as related to blue bikes or otherwise?

351
00:33:56,633 --> 00:33:57,173
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, thank you.

352
00:33:57,193 --> 00:33:58,715
[SPEAKER_13]: I appreciate the kind words.

353
00:33:59,295 --> 00:34:05,260
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, we've successfully expanded the system from three stations just two years ago to now 15.

354
00:34:06,061 --> 00:34:16,049
[SPEAKER_13]: And as a region, we just broke a record with the most rides ever with over 4 million rides this past year, this current year, I mean, 2024.

355
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:28,517
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're trying to keep up with adding bicycle infrastructure as you could probably see from some recent efforts just this past week or two on College Ave, Salem Street and Main Street.

356
00:34:29,038 --> 00:34:39,044
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're trying to continue our efforts to make safe connections from major points of interest like the Green Line and Medford Square and other points of interest like that.

357
00:34:39,565 --> 00:34:45,929
[SPEAKER_13]: So hopefully we could keep pace with the expansion of the blue bikes and continue to provide additional bicycle infrastructure.

358
00:34:47,622 --> 00:34:47,922
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks.

359
00:34:49,303 --> 00:34:50,183
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Director Blake.

360
00:34:51,484 --> 00:34:52,304
[SPEAKER_10]: Any further discussion?

361
00:34:55,506 --> 00:35:00,608
[SPEAKER_10]: Seeing none, on the motion of Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Sang, is that right?

362
00:35:02,529 --> 00:35:03,490
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

375
00:35:21,687 --> 00:35:23,948
[SPEAKER_10]: Having the affirmative and the negative, the motion passes.

376
00:35:26,129 --> 00:35:29,990

[SPEAKER_10]: And thank you, Director Blake.

378
00:35:33,152 --> 00:35:39,014
[SPEAKER_10]: And we did have the tabled item regarding the crew team.

379
00:35:40,534 --> 00:35:44,076
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm thinking maybe we should just table both of them to the next regular meeting.

380
00:35:45,339 --> 00:35:45,659
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

381
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,660
[SPEAKER_10]: Crew team's already tabled.

382
00:35:48,001 --> 00:35:51,622
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, crew team's tabled, so we'll put that back on the next regular meeting agenda.

383
00:35:52,223 --> 00:36:01,988
[SPEAKER_10]: And then is there a motion to table Mr. Castaneda's public participation item for the next regular meeting?

00:36:03,309 --> 00:36:14,595

[SPEAKER_01]: Take your time, but the quicker you do it, the better it is.

430
00:38:02,934 --> 00:38:03,775
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's important.

431
00:38:05,096 --> 00:38:06,617
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, he must've knew me.

432
00:38:08,408 --> 00:38:09,609
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Council President.

433
00:38:10,229 --> 00:38:14,111
[SPEAKER_01]: Andrew Castanetti, Cushing Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

434
00:38:19,133 --> 00:38:28,957
[SPEAKER_01]: My request to the city council, I brought this up a few months ago with $100 cash, but you become a scared, you told me to put the cash away.

435
00:38:29,478 --> 00:38:30,758
[SPEAKER_01]: So I brought a check this time.

436
00:38:33,539 --> 00:38:34,880
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the guy got rid of this licorice.

437
00:38:37,868 --> 00:38:39,208
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to smell my cigarettes.

438
00:38:42,049 --> 00:38:50,450
[SPEAKER_01]: Please see my check, my donation for $100, check number 742.

439
00:38:55,711 --> 00:39:06,893
[SPEAKER_01]: I want this to go forward to light up the Karatek Bridge, the Mystic River footbridge over the Mystic River in memory of Lawrence Larry Lepore.

440
00:39:08,373 --> 00:39:13,856
[SPEAKER_01]: He is well loved by many with this 37 year city employment history.

441
00:39:15,056 --> 00:39:23,120
[SPEAKER_01]: This historic footbridge is the best existential landmark in Medford, Massachusetts.

442
00:39:24,561 --> 00:39:32,425
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would be really cool to see the lights shimmering on a river year round.

443
00:39:33,805 --> 00:39:35,326
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping this beautification

444
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:37,891
[SPEAKER_01]: will be done before the holidays.

445
00:39:38,331 --> 00:39:41,073
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for listening, Andrew P. Castanete.

446
00:39:42,874 --> 00:39:43,354
[SPEAKER_01]: P.S.

447
00:39:44,354 --> 00:39:54,700
[SPEAKER_01]: I've enclosed a photo of the Mystic River footbridge taken by your mom, Mr. President, Mrs. Beers.

448
00:39:56,061 --> 00:39:58,102
[SPEAKER_01]: I met her at the West Bedford Open Studio.

449
00:39:58,122 --> 00:39:58,782
[SPEAKER_01]: She had a booth.

450
00:40:00,883 --> 00:40:04,245
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a beautiful photograph.

451
00:40:04,795 --> 00:40:10,399
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm keeping the original, but it's part of the copy I'm gonna give you along with the check.

452
00:40:13,561 --> 00:40:20,546
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, please submit my request and check to the Mayor, City Mayor, Mayor Brianna.

453
00:40:22,867 --> 00:40:32,354
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have any questions or comments, I do appreciate it, because I walked the bridge a few times, I checked out the two,

454
00:40:32,978 --> 00:40:34,699
[SPEAKER_01]: electric poles on both ends of the bridge.

455
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:37,741
[SPEAKER_01]: They're within spitting distance.

456
00:40:37,761 --> 00:40:41,664
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like four or five feet away from both sides of the bridge.

457
00:40:43,165 --> 00:40:46,667
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it would look really cool.

458
00:40:47,347 --> 00:40:51,790
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I wanted to use some Boston vernacular, it would look pisser.

459
00:40:52,611 --> 00:40:53,051
Wicked pisser.

460
00:40:53,071 --> 00:40:53,952
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for correcting me.

461
00:40:58,089 --> 00:41:01,130
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have any questions or comments, I appreciate it.

462
00:41:01,231 --> 00:41:04,952
[SPEAKER_01]: I seem to know a lot about this.

463
00:41:06,053 --> 00:41:08,194
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you have any questions or comments?

464
00:41:09,514 --> 00:41:09,835
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

465
00:41:09,855 --> 00:41:11,015
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we have any questions?

466
00:41:13,676 --> 00:41:14,597
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Scarpelli.

467
00:41:18,038 --> 00:41:21,340
[SPEAKER_03]: But I know, you know, this is such a great gesture.

468
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:22,420
[SPEAKER_03]: It's exactly your heart.

469
00:41:22,601 --> 00:41:25,342
[SPEAKER_03]: And we appreciate that because you know what it does.

470
00:41:26,667 --> 00:41:31,889
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think we'll ever forget Larry, but just a little symbol to keep Larry's light alive.

471
00:41:32,009 --> 00:41:33,569
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is a great fitting tribute.

472
00:41:33,609 --> 00:41:35,070
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you for that idea.

473
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:47,094
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that if there is something that if we need to make sure that happens and look for some other alternative funding, I think that we as a council should try to find some other avenues to make sure that that happens.

474
00:41:47,134 --> 00:41:48,754
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that'd be a great gesture.

475
00:41:48,774 --> 00:41:50,215
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate that council.

476
00:41:50,255 --> 00:41:50,615
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

477
00:41:50,955 --> 00:41:52,295
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it would really look wicked nice.

478
00:41:55,310 --> 00:42:08,734
[SPEAKER_01]: And year round, it won't be the Longfellow Bridge or the Salt and Pepper Bridge as they call it, but man, looking from the Karatek Bridge towards that lit up, shimmering river, it would be wonderful.

479
00:42:09,814 --> 00:42:12,435
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to push the envelope and confuse matters worse.

480
00:42:13,435 --> 00:42:17,797
[SPEAKER_01]: The Karatek Bridge was built in 1634, I believe.

481
00:42:21,049 --> 00:42:25,873
[SPEAKER_01]: It was recently rebuilt before Carol's went out of business.

482
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:36,882
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was told, you can see the year as you're going out of the square over the bridge and through the woods, that was the bridge, I'm sure.

483
00:42:37,983 --> 00:42:42,366
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the footbridge, but it's all granite.

484
00:42:42,786 --> 00:42:45,709
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure it's been redone that bridge at least five times.

485
00:42:46,169 --> 00:42:49,772
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it was a footbridge at first and it was a drawbridge

486
00:42:50,188 --> 00:42:51,088
[SPEAKER_01]: and it was a toll bridge.

487
00:42:51,728 --> 00:42:56,129
[SPEAKER_01]: So we made the Beacon Hill people pay the toll in order to go to the fells.

488
00:42:57,549 --> 00:42:58,349
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interesting.

489
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:01,170
[SPEAKER_01]: So someone told me it's the first bridge in the USA.

490
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:05,051
[SPEAKER_01]: I started thinking, wait a minute, USA was 1776.

491
00:43:05,411 --> 00:43:06,231
[SPEAKER_01]: This is 1634.

492
00:43:08,511 --> 00:43:11,632
[SPEAKER_01]: So it must be the first bridge in 13 colonies.

493
00:43:12,152 --> 00:43:15,452
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm presuming it might be the first bridge in all of North America.

494
00:43:16,633 --> 00:43:18,373
[SPEAKER_10]: It was definitely the first bridge over the Mystic.

495
00:43:20,123 --> 00:43:23,446
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, this, I mean, I don't wanna push the envelope.

496
00:43:23,486 --> 00:43:28,210
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to get these heavy duty, well-built Christmas lights.

497
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:29,531
[SPEAKER_01]: They shouldn't cost more than $100.

498
00:43:29,571 --> 00:43:34,616
[SPEAKER_01]: And what can they afford more than paying for six packages of cigarettes?

499
00:43:35,116 --> 00:43:36,597
[SPEAKER_01]: That's 16.50 a wack.

500
00:43:37,338 --> 00:43:39,940
[SPEAKER_01]: So the point is, this is not rocket science.

501
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:40,861
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very doable.

502
00:43:41,622 --> 00:43:45,465
[SPEAKER_01]: And there'll be thousands of people that would appreciate this.

503
00:43:47,242 --> 00:43:48,843
[SPEAKER_10]: So, thank you.

504
00:43:48,943 --> 00:43:59,608
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's appropriate that I leave the check with my letter that I hope you forward to the mayor as a council president you meet with him frequently, and it's appropriate that I leave it on the same messages desk.

505
00:44:00,228 --> 00:44:00,628
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

506
00:44:01,168 --> 00:44:02,829
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I appreciate the gesture to Larry.

507
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:11,573
[SPEAKER_10]: We miss him every day, and we will figure out how to do it I just appreciate you bringing it in the form of a check and not cash.

508
00:44:12,893 --> 00:44:14,295
[SPEAKER_10]: So that that helps.

509
00:44:15,376 --> 00:44:19,401
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to save my cash for the real estate tax bills now.

510
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:21,123
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for listening.

511
00:44:22,685 --> 00:44:23,185
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

512
00:44:32,287 --> 00:44:33,568
[SPEAKER_10]: just when I thought I was out.

513
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:37,290
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm gonna go to Councilor Callahan who has requested the microphone.

514
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:38,350
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Callahan.

515
00:44:38,951 --> 00:44:39,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

516
00:44:39,691 --> 00:44:43,713
[SPEAKER_02]: I so appreciate this, the thought, the gesture.

517
00:44:44,294 --> 00:44:51,437
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually went on Amazon and found some solar floodlights that are like either white or multicolored that cost around a hundred bucks.

518
00:44:51,457 --> 00:44:54,899
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think this is something that we could easily make happen pretty quickly.

519
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:55,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

520
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:56,820
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

521
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:58,121
[SPEAKER_10]: Any further discussion?

522
00:44:58,921 --> 00:45:01,703
[SPEAKER_10]: Any further participation in the public participation section of the meeting?

523
00:45:02,830 --> 00:45:04,091
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to go to Zoom.

524
00:45:04,111 --> 00:45:05,291
[SPEAKER_10]: We have Eunice Brown on Zoom.

525
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:07,352
[SPEAKER_10]: Eunice, name and address for the record, please.

526
00:45:08,533 --> 00:45:11,075
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, Eunice Brown, Greenleaf Ave.

527
00:45:11,115 --> 00:45:12,135
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a quick question.

528
00:45:12,555 --> 00:45:28,284
[SPEAKER_08]: I noticed on the calendar tomorrow when I emailed a couple of times about this and didn't get a reply, but there's a regular city council meeting at seven tomorrow night with the agenda item from the mayor, the appropriations from the override.

529
00:45:29,276 --> 00:45:36,283
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that still being held and how is that different from what you guys just did a few minutes ago?

530
00:45:36,804 --> 00:45:51,839
[SPEAKER_08]: And second quick question, have you guys received yet from the mayor the work from the charter commission, the charter that we wrote and the report?

531
00:45:53,873 --> 00:45:54,254
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi Eunice.

532
00:45:55,175 --> 00:46:02,081
[SPEAKER_10]: On the second question we have not yet received the report from the Charter Commission I think it's expected towards the end of the month or the beginning of next month.

533
00:46:03,526 --> 00:46:04,226
[SPEAKER_10]: for tomorrow night.

534
00:46:05,127 --> 00:46:09,428
[SPEAKER_10]: I honestly was unsure as to what was going to happen with the paper tonight.

535
00:46:09,508 --> 00:46:11,209
[SPEAKER_10]: So I didn't know if there'd be a lot of discussion about it.

536
00:46:11,229 --> 00:46:13,530
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't know if we'd want to move to another meeting.

537
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:15,930
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't know if there may be a motion to table.

538
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:17,511
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's why we have the two meetings.

539
00:46:19,051 --> 00:46:20,932
[SPEAKER_10]: We approved it and it's been disposed with tonight.

540
00:46:20,992 --> 00:46:27,934
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't expect that we will have the regular meeting tomorrow night, but we will have the committee of the whole on the tree ordinance at six o'clock.

541
00:46:28,895 --> 00:46:29,735
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, terrific.

542
00:46:29,795 --> 00:46:30,355
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks very much.

543
00:46:30,375 --> 00:46:30,915
[SPEAKER_08]: Have a good night.

544
00:46:32,236 --> 00:46:32,616
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

545
00:46:36,656 --> 00:46:40,397
[SPEAKER_10]: If anyone else would like to participate, please approach the podium or raise your hand on Zoom.

546
00:46:45,819 --> 00:46:50,000
[SPEAKER_10]: Seeing none, on the motion to adjourn by Councillor Scarpelli, seconded by Councillor Lazzaro.

547
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:51,120
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

548
00:46:58,843 --> 00:46:59,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Councillor Kallian.

549
00:47:00,823 --> 00:47:01,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Collins.

550
00:47:02,144 --> 00:47:02,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

551
00:47:03,604 --> 00:47:04,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Councillor Lazzaro.

552
00:47:04,285 --> 00:47:04,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

553
00:47:08,004 --> 00:47:10,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Councillor Scarpelli.

554
00:47:10,926 --> 00:47:11,146
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

555
00:47:12,067 --> 00:47:12,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Councillor Singh.

556
00:47:12,747 --> 00:47:12,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

557
00:47:13,528 --> 00:47:14,148
[SPEAKER_04]: President Behrs.

558
00:47:14,568 --> 00:47:14,749
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
