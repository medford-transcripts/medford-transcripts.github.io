    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=28.789s">Hello,</a>  everyone, and welcome to your show, Method Happenings, a show for and about the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=37.174s">I</a>  am John Petralla. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=39.416s">The</a>  purpose of this program is to give Method citizens facts and information to help you make informed choices. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=49.162s">And</a>  today, I'd like to give a really big welcome to Melanie Tringali, who is a candidate for our Method City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=58.35s">So</a>  thank you, Melanie, for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=60.612s">Thanks</a>  for having me. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=61.754s">OK,</a>  we're going to get right into this, Melanie. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=63.735s">We</a>  don't fool around on this show. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=67.445s">Okay,</a>  so let's start, you know, just give us some background, Melanie, about yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=71.567s">Just</a>  who is Melanie Tringali? <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=73.107s">Gee,</a>  that's a loaded question. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=74.408s">It's</a>  a loaded question.</p>

    <p>[Melanie Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=76.208s">Well,</a>  on a personal level, I'm married to James Murdock, my husband. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=80.99s">We</a>  have four children and one dog. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=83.771s">We've</a>  been residing in Medford close to 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=88.273s">Yeah,</a>  and I have deep roots in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=92.357s">Both</a>  my grandparents lived here, one in South Medford, one on the hillside. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=97.121s">Both</a>  my parents graduated Medford High. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=100.023s">And</a>  ironically, I live now in the house of my pediatrician, Dr. Murphy. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=106.248s">So</a>  many people that live here know that old yellow house on Forest Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=112.514s">And</a>  on a professional level, I work in business. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=116.118s">I've</a>  been in marketing for 20-plus years. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=118.941s">I've</a>  worked for professional services company, nonprofits, education, and community service-wise, I've been on the Methodist Family Network Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=129.774s">I've</a>  worked – I was on the <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=132.82s">I</a>  was the co-chair of the PTO for the Columbus School, which is now the Mississippi, but when I was at the Columbus School. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=140.424s">And</a>  I am now a member of Method Rotary.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=143.166s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=145.067s">Well-rounded,</a>  and that's a lot of stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=150.73s">Good</a>  stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=151.45s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=152.151s">So</a>  you're grounded in Method, really. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=154.392s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=154.652s">I</a>  mean, that's nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=155.933s">That's</a>  good to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=158.537s">So</a>  we know you ran a great campaign the last election. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=163.739s">You</a>  ran for a city council seat. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=165.739s">It</a>  was your first attempt. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=169.061s">You</a>  came really close to winning. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=173.702s">I</a>  guess people want to know, what did you learn from your last experience running? <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=180.164s">What</a>  was it like?</p>

    <p>[Melanie Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=181.085s">Well,</a>  one, the thing I learned is I really enjoyed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=186.526s">It</a>  was a lot of hard work, I'm not going to lie. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=189.222s">But</a>  I really enjoyed meeting people, being out in the community, hearing from different people. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=195.026s">But</a>  then the other lesson I learned is that it's really hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=197.988s">It's</a>  a lot of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=199.389s">It</a>  takes a lot of time and effort from meeting people to fundraising, trying to get up to speed and everything that's happening with the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=208.515s">But</a>  overall, it was a good experience.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=211.007s">Okay,</a>  good answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=213.027s">And</a>  you did run a great campaign, and we all know how hard you worked. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=216.308s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=217.629s">You</a>  really did. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=218.289s">It</a>  was a great campaign, actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=221.589s">So,</a>  you know, you're running again. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=224.31s">What</a>  issues do you see in this election? <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=229.131s">You</a>  know, different from the last election. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=231.332s">What</a>  issues are different from the last time you ran?</p>

    <p>[Melanie Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=235.312s">The</a>  biggest issue right now is the rezoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=238.248s">And</a>  I am really rezoning in a way that disrupts our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=245.292s">And</a>  so we really need to take a step back and protect our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=249.034s">That's</a>  my first thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=250.935s">I</a>  am not against rezoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=253.276s">I</a>  think we need to rezone at a level that brings in a commercial base. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=258.487s">And</a>  not so much this type of this rezoning that's happening is really trying to bring in a lot of density. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=264.18s">And</a>  I don't know if housing density is the right thing for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=267.607s">I</a>  think that <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=269.325s">for</a>  this city to be successful and to grow is we need to think of rezoning in a way that brings in commercial and more businesses so that we're not relying on residential tax bases. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=283.095s">Because</a>  if we continue to rely on residential tax bases, we'll continue to have more overrides. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=289.76s">So</a>  that's one. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=290.761s">I</a>  think other than that, the majority of the issues are still there.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=293.843s">So</a>  basically the same.</p>

    <p>[Melanie Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=295.945s">Most</a>  of them, not all of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=298.307s">You</a>  know, my campaign when I ran two years ago, my campaign was running on the local issues and not on the national issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=305.812s">I</a>  think we need to take a step back and really look at how <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=310.556s">we</a>  function as a city and making sure that we still have problems with our infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=315.928s">We</a>  still have problems with our streets and our roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=319.015s">There's</a>  still <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=322.797s">I</a>  would say budgetary issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=323.998s">We</a>  still come up with $25 million of free cash every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=327.24s">So</a>  why is that continuing to happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=332.042s">That's</a>  not to say we shouldn't have a rainy day fund, but $25 million is a lot of money to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=335.844s">Sure</a>  is. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=339.386s">Revitalizing</a>  our squares, bringing in more of a commercial base. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=342.348s">So</a>  a lot of that stuff is still kind of the same.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=345.089s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Melanie Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=346.17s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=347.29s">But</a>  the main thing right now, I think, is really protecting our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=352.837s">This</a>  rezoning fundamentally changes the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=357.7s">And</a>  it fundamentally changes every single neighborhood we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=362.083s">I've</a>  been living here for 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=364.605s">And</a>  one thing I've always appreciated about the city is the difference between Lawrence Estates, West Medford, East Medford, Glenwood, the hillside. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=374.532s">Every</a>  place is different. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=376.513s">Yes,</a>  it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=377.774s">And</a>  what we're seeing is people coming in and making them kind of look <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=382.817s">Vanilla</a>  and taking away Taking that away.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=386.52s">Yeah,</a>  I I agree with you I mean I talked to a lot of people as you know, and I I always say I don't know anyone that says they don't appreciate zoning but just what you said the squares the you know, what's with all the density and what are we doing and</p>

    <p>[Melanie Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=402.371s">Yeah,</a>  I also don't think just by building more houses, we're going to reduce the cost of housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=408.054s">It's</a>  very expensive to build homes today. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=411.036s">And</a>  given the green initiatives that they want, that actually increases the cost of building houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=419.701s">And</a>  no one's not going to build houses without a profit.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=421.742s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=422.662s">Why</a>  would you? <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=423.263s">It's</a>  not going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=424.544s">That's</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Melanie Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=425.984s">Will</a>  it bring down some costs? <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=428.286s">Maybe,</a>  but not drastically.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=431.632s">I'm</a>  going to change direction now. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=433.073s">I</a>  don't know if you're going to like this question. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=435.314s">This</a>  is going to be a tough one. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=440.277s">But</a>  the last election, 2023, most people are aware that we had some problems with the election. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=450.142s">Some?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=450.462s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=451.243s">I</a>  mean, there was a lot of problems.</p>

    <p>[Melanie Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=453.364s">There</a>  was a lot of problems.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=456.568s">You</a>  know, would you mind discussing some of them?</p>

    <p>[Melanie Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=459.351s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=460.772s">Well,</a>  in 2023, during the local election, there were a lot of problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=467.699s">And</a>  I think a lot of those problems came to fruition or were recognized when the tallies and the results of the election was completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=479.51s">It</a>  almost looked like there was <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=481.555s">counts</a>  or ballots missing because the tallies weren't right. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=486.716s">But</a>  some of the main issues, and I'm going to have to refer to my notes on this one because there's a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=492.537s">So</a>  one, there was misprinting of ballots. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=494.378s">They</a>  sent out incorrect ballots, the mail-in ballots, and they were wrong.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=501.539s">And</a>  that was because of someone's name. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=504.54s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=504.721s">Someone's</a>  name was spelled wrong.</p>

    <p>[Melanie Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=507.423s">I</a>  believe there was incorrect information on the website at one point with incorrect dates. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=512.108s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=513.129s">There</a>  was inaccurate instructions provided to the voter polls and mail-in ballots, if memory serves me right.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=520.055s">Yes,</a>  I remember that.</p>

    <p>[Melanie Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=521.337s">Trainings</a>  that were provided had incorrect information. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=525.14s">People</a>  were told, the poll wardens were telling people they couldn't bring in notes or instructions about who they wanted to vote for, and they were turning people away. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=533.746s">I</a>  know there was many people that went to vote, and they weren't on the voter rolls. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=539.089s">They</a>  somehow, even though they filled out a census, they weren't there. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=542.771s">There</a>  was an issue with the poll location. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=544.713s">I</a>  believe there was an issue with the Roberts School, and one of the poll locations had changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=552.905s">There</a>  was definitely an issue with the ballot counts. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=556.086s">And</a>  when the results were provided, you could tell there was, it looked like there was 700 votes missing. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=565.37s">So</a>  giving all, and actually, for on the record, the city council recognized all these issues and actually agreed, they all voted, <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=582.099s">Every</a>  single one of them agreed that the issues were bad and that they were to write a letter to the Secretary of State asking them to come in and review the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=590.684s">That's</a>  how bad it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=591.524s">So</a>  it was a mess, the election. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=593.045s">Yeah,</a>  it was a mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=594.426s">So</a>  I knew I didn't win. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=596.867s">I</a>  was definitely behind by a couple of hundred votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=600.629s">But</a>  I felt it was important to develop or I felt it important to do a recount. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=606.977s">And</a>  the reason I wanted to do the recount, because I wanted to see if there was any other inconsistencies, given all the stuff leading up to the election and the ballot count. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=616.266s">And</a>  there was.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=616.766s">There</a>  was a lot of concern.</p>

    <p>[Melanie Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=618.028s">There</a>  was a lot of inconsistencies. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=620.67s">The</a>  things that we found were that there was 130 mail-in ballots that were never counted. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=627.585s">Now,</a>  people say, oh, 130, that's nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=629.065s">But</a>  it is something. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=629.705s">That's</a>  someone's vote that was not counted. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=633.026s">And</a>  that goes to show that there's still process. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=635.867s">There's</a>  problems with the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=639.928s">Then</a>  for precinct counting, 80% of the precincts had incorrect tallies. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=649.089s">So</a>  what we did is we counted the ballots. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=652.762s">And</a>  then we compare the ballots to the tallies. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=654.664s">And</a>  what we found were, in some cases, there was more tallies than there were ballots. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=662.252s">And</a>  actually in two of them, two precincts, there was 40 more <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=668.301s">I</a>  mean, all of them had some inconsistencies, but two of them, one was 40 more and one was 50 more. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=672.847s">So</a>  we had 50 more tallies than actual ballots. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=675.911s">So,</a>  yeah, there were a lot of issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=678.834s">And,</a>  you know, I don't know if those got resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=681.277s">You</a>  know, the city council had requested that the elections committee come forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=687.169s">With</a>  the report, I went to that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=689.109s">I</a>  don't know if anything was actually resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=691.51s">In</a>  matter of fact, in 2024, during the federal election, and during the override, I was out one night with a friend, and I said, let's just go over to the, it's eight o'clock, let's go over to City Hall, and let's go watch them tally up the votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=709.394s">And</a>  usually the votes are tallied in chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=711.694s">Chambers,</a>  they have to be, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=712.855s">So</a>  we go up to chambers, there's no one there.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=715.51s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Melanie Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=716.011s">So</a>  I go downstairs to the election office, the Italian in the election office.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=721.035s">Not</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[Melanie Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=721.856s">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=722.217s">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[Melanie Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=723.598s">I</a>  actually went and asked to go and view the Italian. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=729.784s">And</a>  I was told that I could not stand in the election office, that I had to leave and stand outside in the hallway and watch through the window. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=739.357s">Legally,</a>  I have the right to watch them. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=742.841s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=743.202s">And</a>  I'm not, I wasn't going to harass, but as a citizen and knowing all the inconsistencies that happened in 2023, I did have the right to watch. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=752.373s">So</a>  I, you know, with the upcoming election, I think one of my main things is to make sure <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=758.54s">There's</a>  a new manager of the elections office and make sure that the processes, I'm actually going to bring something forward to the city council to make sure that that happens.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=768.205s">That's</a>  important. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=769.045s">I</a>  mean, it has to be followed, plain and simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=772.727s">And</a>  that's, I mean, simple things to do that should be getting done that, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=778.889s">We</a>  need to have fair, clean elections.</p>

    <p>[Melanie Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=780.81s">That's</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=781.811s">People</a>  want to know that their vote was counted. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=783.531s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=783.972s">Yeah,</a>  that matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=784.992s">It</a>  matters a great deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=788.503s">Thank</a>  you for answering that because I thought that was going to be one of those questions that like maybe you were going to sort of tiptoe, but I appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=798.738s">It's</a>  very, very important.</p>

    <p>[Melanie Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=801.141s">And</a>  you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=804.26s">Again,</a>  I didn't do it because I thought that it was gonna change the outcome of the election. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=808.361s">I</a>  did it to make sure that moving forward, people would have confidence that their votes were being counted.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=814.442s">And</a>  that's imperative, it really is. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=818.403s">All</a>  right, so now we're gonna, let's go in another direction here, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=824.704s">Are</a>  you gonna, will you have a different approach to running this campaign? <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=833.685s">you</a>  know, compared to the last one. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=835.046s">In</a>  other words, kind of a basic question, but are you going to do anything different this time around? <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=840.993s">Is</a>  this something that you think you need to do different?</p>

    <p>[Melanie Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=844.402s">The</a>  only thing I think I need to do different really is really look at where I was strong in the voting process and hitting the areas where I may have not been as strong. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=856.371s">Reaching</a>  out to more people. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=858.353s">I</a>  think being less shy about asking help because it's a lot of work and you need the volunteers. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=866.058s">Even</a>  if it's just holding a sign for a day or having a meet and greet at your house so you can meet other people. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=874.572s">Living</a>  here, you think you know a lot of people, and then you realize it's a pretty big, it's a small city, but it's a big city. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=881.681s">So</a>  though I do know a lot of people, and sometimes I think, oh, I didn't realize I knew that many people. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=886.527s">At</a>  the same time, I meet new people every time that I never met before.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=891.108s">Well,</a>  I mean, you did a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=892.449s">I</a>  mean, you really did. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=894.49s">Your</a>  numbers were great last election. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=897.011s">We'll</a>  see what happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=897.931s">I</a>  hope you do get in.</p>

    <p>[Melanie Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=898.671s">So</a>  yeah, I'm hoping to get another, I think I came in at 4,800 votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=903.253s">My</a>  goal is to get another 1,200. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=904.734s">So</a>  my goal is 6,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=905.314s">I</a>  think if I can get 6,000, I can get in.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=908.896s">I</a>  hope so. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=909.676s">I</a>  hope so. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=911.017s">Great</a>  background. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=911.937s">I</a>  mean, everything the city needs, you possess. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=916.69s">All</a>  right, this question I ask everybody, all the candidates that come on. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=923.051s">And</a>  to me, this is like an important question. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=926.872s">What</a>  are your thoughts on city halls, the transparency and the communication?</p>

    <p>[Melanie Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=936.034s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=939.655s">I</a>  think the biggest issue was communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=945.0s">You</a>  know, I'm a marketing professional, that's what I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=947.221s">Communication,</a>  right? <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=949.543s">And</a>  one thing I realized in my role as a marketing professional is everyone digests information in different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=957.268s">Some</a>  people are on social media, some people go and look for the information, some people rely on, well they used to rely on the newspaper, we don't have a newspaper anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=966.013s">Not</a>  everyone's on social media. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=968.435s">And</a>  even on social media people, <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=971.016s">consume</a>  information in different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=972.537s">Some</a>  people go to Instagram, some people go to Facebook, some people go to TikTok, some people go to Reddit, some people look at online newspapers, some, you know, there's just different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=985.844s">And</a>  I don't think we do a good job. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=989.606s">Let's</a>  take the zoning, for example.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=991.787s">Okay,</a>  that was going to be my next question.</p>

    <p>[Melanie Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=993.229s">Okay,</a>  let's take the zoning as an example. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=995.071s">So</a>  one, we don't communicate enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=997.674s">Two,</a>  it's hard to find information and the information when you find it is not easily digestible. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1003.458s">And</a>  what I mean by that is the zoning is a really good example of bad communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1009.501s">I've</a>  been involved in the zoning since they started on Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1012.423s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1013.383s">There</a>  was little information about the Salem Street zoning in what was happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1019.306s">There</a>  was no notices that I know of that was put in tax bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1022.288s">And</a>  matter of fact, I know it's not because I do own a property that was part of the rezoning piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1027.31s">And</a>  I'm going to be up front. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1028.211s">I</a>  do want to to <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1030.572s">two-family</a>  on Park Street that is right on the corner of Salem and Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1038.715s">And</a>  I never got notification. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1040.095s">The</a>  only reason I found out about it is due to Sheryl Rodriguez and Gene Nuzzo. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1044.317s">And</a>  I got involved in that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1046.697s">And</a>  in the sense that I was going to the meetings, I was presenting my thoughts and my feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1055.832s">What</a>  happened over there is really too bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1060.033s">That</a>  zoning was pushed through without any planning, with resident feedback, but that resident feedback really wasn't taken into account. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1071.176s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1073.016s">And</a>  then what I mean by easily digestible is that unless you're an architect, <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1080.147s">or</a>  some zoning person, trying to read all this information is very challenging. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1085.73s">If</a>  you have a full-time job, trying to do this is really challenging. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1092.474s">And</a>  I mean, I'm still trying to get caught up on everything and what the zoning means. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1099.198s">So</a>  it's not in layman terms. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1101.279s">I</a>  know I've been to community development board meetings where even the board members have asked for easy <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1110.253s">easy</a>  keys and easy ways to understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1113.095s">Simplify</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1113.735s">There's</a>  got to be a way to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1115.496s">The</a>  information was not always available timely before meetings to review. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1119.058s">And</a>  there was a couple of meetings that I went to that the presentations were not up on time. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1123.92s">And</a>  then I think the other thing is that the information is hard to find, regardless of the zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1127.882s">You</a>  go to the Medford website. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1129.863s">I</a>  mean, I was trying to look at minutes from two years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1134.465s">They're</a>  all on Google Docs. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1140.172s">senior,</a>  I don't even want to just say senior, but if you're just not, like my husband, my husband is technically inept. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1147.316s">I'll</a>  be honest. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1147.896s">He</a>  can fix your car, he can build anything, but when it comes to technology, simple things on his phone, he's inept. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1156.74s">So</a>  it will be a challenge for people to find the information they need and then get it in layman terms. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1164.064s">That</a>  being said, I do think improvements have been made over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1167.485s">The</a>  website has been updated. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1169.065s">They</a>  have been making improvements to try to get information out. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1173.646s">For</a>  the zoning, it was too late. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1176.067s">I</a>  mean, I know the mayor, there was finally stuff put in the tax things for the West Medford and Lawrence Estates, but it was too late. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1183.348s">They</a>  should have started that from the very beginning, and they didn't.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1188.091s">Yep,</a>  yep. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1189.312s">I</a>  hear you. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1191.635s">I</a>  get confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1193.217s">Not</a>  that I'm a brain or anything, but I get very confused trying to follow the zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1199.063s">I</a>  got to throw a plug in. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1203.267s">Forgotten</a>  old method that is an online newspaper. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1206.148s">They're</a>  new. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1206.928s">Yeah,</a>  but they're doing a pretty good job and hopefully They'll be used to get more information out because I agree with you 100% It's just not coming out. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1217.23s">And</a>  when it does come out, I Know a lot of people really it is it's confusing. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1222.071s">Yeah,</a>  that's all great points Melanie.</p>

    <p>[Melanie Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1224.011s">Yeah,</a>  I do think the Community Development Board I I do have a lot of respect for Emily. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1230.093s">I</a>  think she's been very I <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1233.228s">fair</a>  and trying to get everyone's information and hear everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1237.311s">And</a>  I have, you know, again, it's just a little, I think a lot of this stuff happened a little bit too late. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1246.822s">And</a>  we all know at the end, it's the city council that makes the decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1249.404s">They</a>  can take the recommendation from the community development board, or they can not take it. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1253.947s">And</a>  that's what happened on Salem Street.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1256.409s">Yeah,</a>  I hate to say it. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1257.449s">I</a>  think we know where that goes once it gets to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1259.831s">So</a>  my next question was going to be on zoning, but I think we covered. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1264.635s">I</a>  was going to ask you, what was your position on it?</p>

    <p>[Melanie Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1267.396s">Well,</a>  I want to be clear, because I think <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1271.639s">I</a>  do think we need to rezone. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1273.163s">I'm</a>  not saying that we shouldn't rezone. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1274.926s">I</a>  think we need to focus on specific areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1278.463s">The</a>  squares, I think rezoning will help to revitalize the squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1282.846s">Mr.</a>  Gav, the Fellsway, but it needs to be done in a thoughtful and planful manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1288.29s">And</a>  it's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1289.571s">So,</a>  for example, we put out three RFPs for three parcels in Medford Square before the rezoning was even done. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1296.355s">Why</a>  wasn't that done, why wasn't planning done together? <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1300.118s">Like,</a>  okay, this is our vision for Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1303.728s">And</a>  to include that vision, this is what we want. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1305.909s">And</a>  to do that, this is the type of rezoning we're thinking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1310.149s">There</a>  just needs to be a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1311.29s">And</a>  I'll give another good example. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1313.99s">In</a>  my eyes, anyways, if you look at the Felsbury where Stop and Shop is, that's a huge property. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1320.992s">And</a>  if we had thought and planned out that appropriately, have you ever tried that parking lot?</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1328.575s">It's</a>  not even... It's kind of, yeah, the angles.</p>

    <p>[Melanie Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1331.578s">It's</a>  the angles and where Keynes is too. <a href="https://youtu.be/76AnRcU6pIg&t=1334.081s">That</a>  came in, yeah.</p>
