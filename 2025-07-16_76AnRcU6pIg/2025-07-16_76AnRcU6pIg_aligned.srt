00:00:28,789 --> 00:00:36,194
Hello, everyone, and welcome to your show, Method Happenings, a show for and about the city of Method.

2
00:00:37,174 --> 00:00:38,575
I am John Petralla.

3
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:48,221
The purpose of this program is to give Method citizens facts and information to help you make informed choices.

4
00:00:49,162 --> 00:00:57,830
And today, I'd like to give a really big welcome to Melanie Tringali, who is a candidate for our Method City Council.

5
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,152
So thank you, Melanie, for being here.

6
00:01:00,612 --> 00:01:01,373
Thanks for having me.

7
00:01:01,754 --> 00:01:03,715
OK, we're going to get right into this, Melanie.

8
00:01:03,735 --> 00:01:05,317
We don't fool around on this show.

9
00:01:07,445 --> 00:01:11,487
Okay, so let's start, you know, just give us some background, Melanie, about yourself.

10
00:01:11,567 --> 00:01:13,087
Just who is Melanie Tringali?

11
00:01:13,107 --> 00:01:14,388
Gee, that's a loaded question.

12
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:15,328
It's a loaded question.

13
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:20,850
Well, on a personal level, I'm married to James Murdock, my husband.

14
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:23,111
We have four children and one dog.

15
00:01:23,771 --> 00:01:26,633
We've been residing in Medford close to 30 years.

16
00:01:28,273 --> 00:01:31,856
Yeah, and I have deep roots in the city of Medford.

17
00:01:32,357 --> 00:01:36,500
Both my grandparents lived here, one in South Medford, one on the hillside.

18
00:01:37,121 --> 00:01:38,822
Both my parents graduated Medford High.

19
00:01:40,023 --> 00:01:46,208
And ironically, I live now in the house of my pediatrician, Dr. Murphy.

20
00:01:46,248 --> 00:01:50,111
So many people that live here know that old yellow house on Forest Street.

21
00:01:52,514 --> 00:01:56,038
And on a professional level, I work in business.

22
00:01:56,118 --> 00:01:58,361
I've been in marketing for 20-plus years.

23
00:01:58,941 --> 00:02:08,913
I've worked for professional services company, nonprofits, education, and community service-wise, I've been on the Methodist Family Network Board.

24
00:02:09,774 --> 00:02:11,516
I've worked â€“ I was on the

25
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:20,144
I was the co-chair of the PTO for the Columbus School, which is now the Mississippi, but when I was at the Columbus School.

26
00:02:20,424 --> 00:02:22,826
And I am now a member of Method Rotary.

27
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:23,526
OK.

28
00:02:25,067 --> 00:02:30,070
Well-rounded, and that's a lot of stuff.

29
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:31,410
Good stuff.

30
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:31,650
Yeah.

31
00:02:32,151 --> 00:02:34,332
So you're grounded in Method, really.

32
00:02:34,392 --> 00:02:34,552
Yeah.

33
00:02:34,652 --> 00:02:35,873
I mean, that's nice.

34
00:02:35,933 --> 00:02:36,693
That's good to hear.

35
00:02:38,537 --> 00:02:43,379
So we know you ran a great campaign the last election.

36
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:45,479
You ran for a city council seat.

37
00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:46,900
It was your first attempt.

38
00:02:49,061 --> 00:02:51,461
You came really close to winning.

39
00:02:53,702 --> 00:02:59,564
I guess people want to know, what did you learn from your last experience running?

40
00:03:00,164 --> 00:03:01,045
What was it like?

41
00:03:01,085 --> 00:03:04,706
Well, one, the thing I learned is I really enjoyed it.

42
00:03:06,526 --> 00:03:08,187
It was a lot of hard work, I'm not going to lie.

43
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:14,245
But I really enjoyed meeting people, being out in the community, hearing from different people.

44
00:03:15,026 --> 00:03:16,847
But then the other lesson I learned is that it's really hard.

45
00:03:17,988 --> 00:03:18,848
It's a lot of work.

46
00:03:19,389 --> 00:03:28,355
It takes a lot of time and effort from meeting people to fundraising, trying to get up to speed and everything that's happening with the city.

47
00:03:28,515 --> 00:03:30,316
But overall, it was a good experience.

48
00:03:31,007 --> 00:03:32,487
Okay, good answer.

49
00:03:33,027 --> 00:03:36,268
And you did run a great campaign, and we all know how hard you worked.

50
00:03:36,308 --> 00:03:37,588
Thank you.

51
00:03:37,629 --> 00:03:38,269
You really did.

52
00:03:38,289 --> 00:03:39,869
It was a great campaign, actually.

53
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:43,970
So, you know, you're running again.

54
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:47,351
What issues do you see in this election?

55
00:03:49,131 --> 00:03:50,991
You know, different from the last election.

56
00:03:51,332 --> 00:03:54,172
What issues are different from the last time you ran?

57
00:03:55,312 --> 00:03:57,053
The biggest issue right now is the rezoning.

58
00:03:58,248 --> 00:04:04,832
And I am really rezoning in a way that disrupts our neighborhoods.

59
00:04:05,292 --> 00:04:08,974
And so we really need to take a step back and protect our neighborhoods.

60
00:04:09,034 --> 00:04:10,314
That's my first thought.

61
00:04:10,935 --> 00:04:12,215
I am not against rezoning.

62
00:04:13,276 --> 00:04:17,018
I think we need to rezone at a level that brings in a commercial base.

63
00:04:18,487 --> 00:04:23,879
And not so much this type of this rezoning that's happening is really trying to bring in a lot of density.

64
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,926
And I don't know if housing density is the right thing for the city of Medford.

65
00:04:27,607 --> 00:04:28,128
I think that

66
00:04:29,325 --> 00:04:42,235
for this city to be successful and to grow is we need to think of rezoning in a way that brings in commercial and more businesses so that we're not relying on residential tax bases.

67
00:04:43,095 --> 00:04:48,679
Because if we continue to rely on residential tax bases, we'll continue to have more overrides.

68
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,441
So that's one.

69
00:04:50,761 --> 00:04:53,143
I think other than that, the majority of the issues are still there.

70
00:04:53,843 --> 00:04:55,264
So basically the same.

71
00:04:55,945 --> 00:04:57,106
Most of them, not all of them.

72
00:04:58,307 --> 00:05:05,452
You know, my campaign when I ran two years ago, my campaign was running on the local issues and not on the national issues.

73
00:05:05,812 --> 00:05:08,455
I think we need to take a step back and really look at how

74
00:05:10,556 --> 00:05:15,106
we function as a city and making sure that we still have problems with our infrastructure.

75
00:05:15,928 --> 00:05:18,053
We still have problems with our streets and our roads.

76
00:05:19,015 --> 00:05:19,496
There's still

77
00:05:22,797 --> 00:05:23,978
I would say budgetary issues.

78
00:05:23,998 --> 00:05:27,120
We still come up with $25 million of free cash every year.

79
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,381
So why is that continuing to happen?

80
00:05:32,042 --> 00:05:35,584
That's not to say we shouldn't have a rainy day fund, but $25 million is a lot of money to have.

81
00:05:35,844 --> 00:05:39,226
Sure is.

82
00:05:39,386 --> 00:05:42,328
Revitalizing our squares, bringing in more of a commercial base.

83
00:05:42,348 --> 00:05:44,629
So a lot of that stuff is still kind of the same.

84
00:05:45,089 --> 00:05:45,429
OK.

85
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:46,450
All right.

86
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:51,533
But the main thing right now, I think, is really protecting our neighborhoods.

87
00:05:52,837 --> 00:05:56,940
This rezoning fundamentally changes the city of Medford.

88
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:01,163
And it fundamentally changes every single neighborhood we have.

89
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,584
I've been living here for 30 years.

90
00:06:04,605 --> 00:06:14,151
And one thing I've always appreciated about the city is the difference between Lawrence Estates, West Medford, East Medford, Glenwood, the hillside.

91
00:06:14,532 --> 00:06:16,493
Every place is different.

92
00:06:16,513 --> 00:06:17,754
Yes, it is.

93
00:06:17,774 --> 00:06:21,977
And what we're seeing is people coming in and making them kind of look

94
00:06:22,817 --> 00:06:26,380
Vanilla and taking away Taking that away.

95
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:42,211
Yeah, I I agree with you I mean I talked to a lot of people as you know, and I I always say I don't know anyone that says they don't appreciate zoning but just what you said the squares the you know, what's with all the density and what are we doing and

96
00:06:42,371 --> 00:06:47,354
Yeah, I also don't think just by building more houses, we're going to reduce the cost of housing.

97
00:06:48,054 --> 00:06:50,456
It's very expensive to build homes today.

98
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:59,241
And given the green initiatives that they want, that actually increases the cost of building houses.

99
00:06:59,701 --> 00:07:01,542
And no one's not going to build houses without a profit.

100
00:07:01,742 --> 00:07:01,962
Right.

101
00:07:02,662 --> 00:07:03,143
Why would you?

102
00:07:03,263 --> 00:07:04,504
It's not going to happen.

103
00:07:04,544 --> 00:07:05,344
That's right.

104
00:07:05,984 --> 00:07:08,026
Will it bring down some costs?

105
00:07:08,286 --> 00:07:09,967
Maybe, but not drastically.

106
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:12,933
I'm going to change direction now.

107
00:07:13,073 --> 00:07:15,294
I don't know if you're going to like this question.

108
00:07:15,314 --> 00:07:18,556
This is going to be a tough one.

109
00:07:20,277 --> 00:07:29,922
But the last election, 2023, most people are aware that we had some problems with the election.

110
00:07:30,142 --> 00:07:30,402
Some?

111
00:07:30,462 --> 00:07:30,642
Yeah.

112
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:33,344
I mean, there was a lot of problems.

113
00:07:33,364 --> 00:07:34,144
There was a lot of problems.

114
00:07:36,568 --> 00:07:38,830
You know, would you mind discussing some of them?

115
00:07:39,351 --> 00:07:39,611
Sure.

116
00:07:40,772 --> 00:07:46,057
Well, in 2023, during the local election, there were a lot of problems.

117
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:59,470
And I think a lot of those problems came to fruition or were recognized when the tallies and the results of the election was completed.

118
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,411
It almost looked like there was

119
00:08:01,555 --> 00:08:04,996
counts or ballots missing because the tallies weren't right.

120
00:08:06,716 --> 00:08:11,957
But some of the main issues, and I'm going to have to refer to my notes on this one because there's a lot.

121
00:08:12,537 --> 00:08:14,318
So one, there was misprinting of ballots.

122
00:08:14,378 --> 00:08:21,039
They sent out incorrect ballots, the mail-in ballots, and they were wrong.

123
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:23,560
And that was because of someone's name.

124
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:24,701
Right.

125
00:08:24,721 --> 00:08:26,182
Someone's name was spelled wrong.

126
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:31,607
I believe there was incorrect information on the website at one point with incorrect dates.

127
00:08:32,108 --> 00:08:32,528
Okay.

128
00:08:33,129 --> 00:08:39,795
There was inaccurate instructions provided to the voter polls and mail-in ballots, if memory serves me right.

129
00:08:40,055 --> 00:08:41,277
Yes, I remember that.

130
00:08:41,337 --> 00:08:44,199
Trainings that were provided had incorrect information.

131
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:52,885
People were told, the poll wardens were telling people they couldn't bring in notes or instructions about who they wanted to vote for, and they were turning people away.

132
00:08:53,746 --> 00:08:57,168
I know there was many people that went to vote, and they weren't on the voter rolls.

133
00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:02,051
They somehow, even though they filled out a census, they weren't there.

134
00:09:02,771 --> 00:09:04,573
There was an issue with the poll location.

135
00:09:04,713 --> 00:09:10,016
I believe there was an issue with the Roberts School, and one of the poll locations had changed.

136
00:09:12,905 --> 00:09:15,526
There was definitely an issue with the ballot counts.

137
00:09:16,086 --> 00:09:23,830
And when the results were provided, you could tell there was, it looked like there was 700 votes missing.

138
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:41,077
So giving all, and actually, for on the record, the city council recognized all these issues and actually agreed, they all voted,

139
00:09:42,099 --> 00:09:50,664
Every single one of them agreed that the issues were bad and that they were to write a letter to the Secretary of State asking them to come in and review the process.

140
00:09:50,684 --> 00:09:51,464
That's how bad it was.

141
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,025
So it was a mess, the election.

142
00:09:53,045 --> 00:09:53,845
Yeah, it was a mess.

143
00:09:54,426 --> 00:09:56,487
So I knew I didn't win.

144
00:09:56,867 --> 00:09:59,568
I was definitely behind by a couple of hundred votes.

145
00:10:00,629 --> 00:10:05,872
But I felt it was important to develop or I felt it important to do a recount.

146
00:10:06,977 --> 00:10:15,765
And the reason I wanted to do the recount, because I wanted to see if there was any other inconsistencies, given all the stuff leading up to the election and the ballot count.

147
00:10:16,266 --> 00:10:16,746
And there was.

148
00:10:16,766 --> 00:10:17,927
There was a lot of concern.

149
00:10:18,028 --> 00:10:19,889
There was a lot of inconsistencies.

150
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:26,516
The things that we found were that there was 130 mail-in ballots that were never counted.

151
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,025
Now, people say, oh, 130, that's nothing.

152
00:10:29,065 --> 00:10:29,685
But it is something.

153
00:10:29,705 --> 00:10:32,126
That's someone's vote that was not counted.

154
00:10:33,026 --> 00:10:35,747
And that goes to show that there's still process.

155
00:10:35,867 --> 00:10:38,587
There's problems with the process.

156
00:10:39,928 --> 00:10:48,449
Then for precinct counting, 80% of the precincts had incorrect tallies.

157
00:10:49,089 --> 00:10:51,710
So what we did is we counted the ballots.

158
00:10:52,762 --> 00:10:54,604
And then we compare the ballots to the tallies.

159
00:10:54,664 --> 00:11:01,131
And what we found were, in some cases, there was more tallies than there were ballots.

160
00:11:02,252 --> 00:11:06,016
And actually in two of them, two precincts, there was 40 more

161
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:12,807
I mean, all of them had some inconsistencies, but two of them, one was 40 more and one was 50 more.

162
00:11:12,847 --> 00:11:15,250
So we had 50 more tallies than actual ballots.

163
00:11:15,911 --> 00:11:17,573
So, yeah, there were a lot of issues.

164
00:11:18,834 --> 00:11:21,137
And, you know, I don't know if those got resolved.

165
00:11:21,277 --> 00:11:24,842
You know, the city council had requested that the elections committee come forward.

166
00:11:27,169 --> 00:11:29,089
With the report, I went to that meeting.

167
00:11:29,109 --> 00:11:30,830
I don't know if anything was actually resolved.

168
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:48,114
In matter of fact, in 2024, during the federal election, and during the override, I was out one night with a friend, and I said, let's just go over to the, it's eight o'clock, let's go over to City Hall, and let's go watch them tally up the votes.

169
00:11:49,394 --> 00:11:51,554
And usually the votes are tallied in chambers.

170
00:11:51,694 --> 00:11:52,835
Chambers, they have to be, right?

171
00:11:52,855 --> 00:11:54,255
So we go up to chambers, there's no one there.

172
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:55,930
OK.

173
00:11:56,011 --> 00:12:00,355
So I go downstairs to the election office, the Italian in the election office.

174
00:12:01,035 --> 00:12:01,476
Not good.

175
00:12:01,856 --> 00:12:01,996
No.

176
00:12:02,217 --> 00:12:03,097
No.

177
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:08,863
I actually went and asked to go and view the Italian.

178
00:12:09,784 --> 00:12:15,610
And I was told that I could not stand in the election office, that I had to leave and stand outside in the hallway and watch through the window.

179
00:12:19,357 --> 00:12:22,421
Legally, I have the right to watch them.

180
00:12:22,841 --> 00:12:23,162
Absolutely.

181
00:12:23,202 --> 00:12:31,712
And I'm not, I wasn't going to harass, but as a citizen and knowing all the inconsistencies that happened in 2023, I did have the right to watch.

182
00:12:32,373 --> 00:12:37,019
So I, you know, with the upcoming election, I think one of my main things is to make sure

183
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:47,784
There's a new manager of the elections office and make sure that the processes, I'm actually going to bring something forward to the city council to make sure that that happens.

184
00:12:48,205 --> 00:12:48,925
That's important.

185
00:12:49,045 --> 00:12:52,707
I mean, it has to be followed, plain and simple.

186
00:12:52,727 --> 00:12:58,809
And that's, I mean, simple things to do that should be getting done that, yeah.

187
00:12:58,889 --> 00:13:00,790
We need to have fair, clean elections.

188
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:01,290
That's right.

189
00:13:01,811 --> 00:13:03,491
People want to know that their vote was counted.

190
00:13:03,531 --> 00:13:03,711
Right.

191
00:13:03,972 --> 00:13:04,952
Yeah, that matters.

192
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:05,932
It matters a great deal.

193
00:13:08,503 --> 00:13:18,658
Thank you for answering that because I thought that was going to be one of those questions that like maybe you were going to sort of tiptoe, but I appreciate it.

194
00:13:18,738 --> 00:13:20,941
It's very, very important.

195
00:13:21,141 --> 00:13:22,083
And you know,

196
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:28,161
Again, I didn't do it because I thought that it was gonna change the outcome of the election.

197
00:13:28,361 --> 00:13:34,422
I did it to make sure that moving forward, people would have confidence that their votes were being counted.

198
00:13:34,442 --> 00:13:36,982
And that's imperative, it really is.

199
00:13:38,403 --> 00:13:42,643
All right, so now we're gonna, let's go in another direction here, okay?

200
00:13:44,704 --> 00:13:51,505
Are you gonna, will you have a different approach to running this campaign?

201
00:13:53,685 --> 00:13:55,006
you know, compared to the last one.

202
00:13:55,046 --> 00:14:00,933
In other words, kind of a basic question, but are you going to do anything different this time around?

203
00:14:00,993 --> 00:14:03,777
Is this something that you think you need to do different?

204
00:14:04,402 --> 00:14:15,450
The only thing I think I need to do different really is really look at where I was strong in the voting process and hitting the areas where I may have not been as strong.

205
00:14:16,371 --> 00:14:17,572
Reaching out to more people.

206
00:14:18,353 --> 00:14:25,338
I think being less shy about asking help because it's a lot of work and you need the volunteers.

207
00:14:26,058 --> 00:14:31,602
Even if it's just holding a sign for a day or having a meet and greet at your house so you can meet other people.

208
00:14:34,572 --> 00:14:41,421
Living here, you think you know a lot of people, and then you realize it's a pretty big, it's a small city, but it's a big city.

209
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:46,507
So though I do know a lot of people, and sometimes I think, oh, I didn't realize I knew that many people.

210
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:49,791
At the same time, I meet new people every time that I never met before.

211
00:14:51,108 --> 00:14:52,429
Well, I mean, you did a great job.

212
00:14:52,449 --> 00:14:53,509
I mean, you really did.

213
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:56,410
Your numbers were great last election.

214
00:14:57,011 --> 00:14:57,871
We'll see what happens.

215
00:14:57,931 --> 00:14:58,651
I hope you do get in.

216
00:14:58,671 --> 00:15:02,433
So yeah, I'm hoping to get another, I think I came in at 4,800 votes.

217
00:15:03,253 --> 00:15:04,214
My goal is to get another 1,200.

218
00:15:04,734 --> 00:15:05,214
So my goal is 6,000.

219
00:15:05,314 --> 00:15:08,336
I think if I can get 6,000, I can get in.

220
00:15:08,896 --> 00:15:09,436
I hope so.

221
00:15:09,676 --> 00:15:10,937
I hope so.

222
00:15:11,017 --> 00:15:11,917
Great background.

223
00:15:11,937 --> 00:15:14,839
I mean, everything the city needs, you possess.

224
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:22,491
All right, this question I ask everybody, all the candidates that come on.

225
00:15:23,051 --> 00:15:25,612
And to me, this is like an important question.

226
00:15:26,872 --> 00:15:34,294
What are your thoughts on city halls, the transparency and the communication?

227
00:15:36,034 --> 00:15:37,595
OK.

228
00:15:39,655 --> 00:15:41,515
I think the biggest issue was communication.

229
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,961
You know, I'm a marketing professional, that's what I do.

230
00:15:47,221 --> 00:15:48,762
Communication, right?

231
00:15:49,543 --> 00:15:56,427
And one thing I realized in my role as a marketing professional is everyone digests information in different ways.

232
00:15:57,268 --> 00:16:05,253
Some people are on social media, some people go and look for the information, some people rely on, well they used to rely on the newspaper, we don't have a newspaper anymore.

233
00:16:06,013 --> 00:16:07,794
Not everyone's on social media.

234
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:09,835
And even on social media people,

235
00:16:11,016 --> 00:16:12,477
consume information in different ways.

236
00:16:12,537 --> 00:16:25,704
Some people go to Instagram, some people go to Facebook, some people go to TikTok, some people go to Reddit, some people look at online newspapers, some, you know, there's just different ways.

237
00:16:25,844 --> 00:16:27,645
And I don't think we do a good job.

238
00:16:29,606 --> 00:16:30,947
Let's take the zoning, for example.

239
00:16:31,787 --> 00:16:33,209
Okay, that was going to be my next question.

240
00:16:33,229 --> 00:16:34,931
Okay, let's take the zoning as an example.

241
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,893
So one, we don't communicate enough.

242
00:16:37,674 --> 00:16:42,440
Two, it's hard to find information and the information when you find it is not easily digestible.

243
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:49,321
And what I mean by that is the zoning is a really good example of bad communication.

244
00:16:49,501 --> 00:16:52,243
I've been involved in the zoning since they started on Salem Street.

245
00:16:52,423 --> 00:16:52,683
Right.

246
00:16:53,383 --> 00:16:59,166
There was little information about the Salem Street zoning in what was happening.

247
00:16:59,306 --> 00:17:02,188
There was no notices that I know of that was put in tax bills.

248
00:17:02,288 --> 00:17:07,110
And matter of fact, I know it's not because I do own a property that was part of the rezoning piece.

249
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,131
And I'm going to be up front.

250
00:17:08,211 --> 00:17:09,612
I do want to to

251
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:16,434
two-family on Park Street that is right on the corner of Salem and Park.

252
00:17:18,715 --> 00:17:20,035
And I never got notification.

253
00:17:20,095 --> 00:17:24,096
The only reason I found out about it is due to Sheryl Rodriguez and Gene Nuzzo.

254
00:17:24,317 --> 00:17:26,457
And I got involved in that process.

255
00:17:26,697 --> 00:17:34,000
And in the sense that I was going to the meetings, I was presenting my thoughts and my feedback.

256
00:17:35,832 --> 00:17:38,813
What happened over there is really too bad.

257
00:17:40,033 --> 00:17:50,916
That zoning was pushed through without any planning, with resident feedback, but that resident feedback really wasn't taken into account.

258
00:17:51,176 --> 00:17:52,676
No.

259
00:17:53,016 --> 00:17:59,058
And then what I mean by easily digestible is that unless you're an architect,

260
00:18:00,147 --> 00:18:05,310
or some zoning person, trying to read all this information is very challenging.

261
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:12,234
If you have a full-time job, trying to do this is really challenging.

262
00:18:12,474 --> 00:18:16,596
And I mean, I'm still trying to get caught up on everything and what the zoning means.

263
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:20,759
So it's not in layman terms.

264
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:26,482
I know I've been to community development board meetings where even the board members have asked for easy

265
00:18:30,253 --> 00:18:33,054
easy keys and easy ways to understand.

266
00:18:33,095 --> 00:18:33,715
Simplify it.

267
00:18:33,735 --> 00:18:35,316
There's got to be a way to do that.

268
00:18:35,496 --> 00:18:39,038
The information was not always available timely before meetings to review.

269
00:18:39,058 --> 00:18:42,519
And there was a couple of meetings that I went to that the presentations were not up on time.

270
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,842
And then I think the other thing is that the information is hard to find, regardless of the zoning.

271
00:18:47,882 --> 00:18:49,443
You go to the Medford website.

272
00:18:49,863 --> 00:18:54,065
I mean, I was trying to look at minutes from two years ago.

273
00:18:54,465 --> 00:18:55,786
They're all on Google Docs.

274
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:06,535
senior, I don't even want to just say senior, but if you're just not, like my husband, my husband is technically inept.

275
00:19:07,316 --> 00:19:07,836
I'll be honest.

276
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:15,920
He can fix your car, he can build anything, but when it comes to technology, simple things on his phone, he's inept.

277
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:23,164
So it will be a challenge for people to find the information they need and then get it in layman terms.

278
00:19:24,064 --> 00:19:27,365
That being said, I do think improvements have been made over time.

279
00:19:27,485 --> 00:19:29,045
The website has been updated.

280
00:19:29,065 --> 00:19:32,486
They have been making improvements to try to get information out.

281
00:19:33,646 --> 00:19:36,047
For the zoning, it was too late.

282
00:19:36,067 --> 00:19:43,268
I mean, I know the mayor, there was finally stuff put in the tax things for the West Medford and Lawrence Estates, but it was too late.

283
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:46,249
They should have started that from the very beginning, and they didn't.

284
00:19:48,091 --> 00:19:48,712
Yep, yep.

285
00:19:49,312 --> 00:19:49,853
I hear you.

286
00:19:51,635 --> 00:19:52,616
I get confused.

287
00:19:53,217 --> 00:19:58,202
Not that I'm a brain or anything, but I get very confused trying to follow the zoning.

288
00:19:59,063 --> 00:20:00,644
I got to throw a plug in.

289
00:20:03,267 --> 00:20:06,108
Forgotten old method that is an online newspaper.

290
00:20:06,148 --> 00:20:06,668
They're new.

291
00:20:06,928 --> 00:20:16,770
Yeah, but they're doing a pretty good job and hopefully They'll be used to get more information out because I agree with you 100% It's just not coming out.

292
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:22,051
And when it does come out, I Know a lot of people really it is it's confusing.

293
00:20:22,071 --> 00:20:23,891
Yeah, that's all great points Melanie.

294
00:20:24,011 --> 00:20:30,053
Yeah, I do think the Community Development Board I I do have a lot of respect for Emily.

295
00:20:30,093 --> 00:20:31,033
I think she's been very I

296
00:20:33,228 --> 00:20:37,111
fair and trying to get everyone's information and hear everyone.

297
00:20:37,311 --> 00:20:43,956
And I have, you know, again, it's just a little, I think a lot of this stuff happened a little bit too late.

298
00:20:46,822 --> 00:20:49,384
And we all know at the end, it's the city council that makes the decision.

299
00:20:49,404 --> 00:20:53,747
They can take the recommendation from the community development board, or they can not take it.

300
00:20:53,947 --> 00:20:56,389
And that's what happened on Salem Street.

301
00:20:56,409 --> 00:20:57,409
Yeah, I hate to say it.

302
00:20:57,449 --> 00:20:59,771
I think we know where that goes once it gets to them.

303
00:20:59,831 --> 00:21:04,574
So my next question was going to be on zoning, but I think we covered.

304
00:21:04,635 --> 00:21:07,356
I was going to ask you, what was your position on it?

305
00:21:07,396 --> 00:21:10,659
Well, I want to be clear, because I think

306
00:21:11,639 --> 00:21:12,962
I do think we need to rezone.

307
00:21:13,163 --> 00:21:14,886
I'm not saying that we shouldn't rezone.

308
00:21:14,926 --> 00:21:17,011
I think we need to focus on specific areas.

309
00:21:18,463 --> 00:21:21,565
The squares, I think rezoning will help to revitalize the squares.

310
00:21:22,846 --> 00:21:27,589
Mr. Gav, the Felsway, but it needs to be done in a thoughtful and planful manner.

311
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:28,950
And it's not.

312
00:21:29,571 --> 00:21:35,775
So, for example, we put out three RFPs for three parcels in Medford Square before the rezoning was even done.

313
00:21:36,355 --> 00:21:39,958
Why wasn't that done, why wasn't planning done together?

314
00:21:40,118 --> 00:21:42,580
Like, okay, this is our vision for Medford Square.

315
00:21:43,728 --> 00:21:45,828
And to include that vision, this is what we want.

316
00:21:45,909 --> 00:21:48,349
And to do that, this is the type of rezoning we're thinking about.

317
00:21:50,149 --> 00:21:51,270
There just needs to be a plan.

318
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:53,130
And I'll give another good example.

319
00:21:53,990 --> 00:22:00,312
In my eyes, anyways, if you look at the Felsbury where Stop and Shop is, that's a huge property.

320
00:22:00,992 --> 00:22:06,213
And if we had thought and planned out that appropriately, have you ever tried that parking lot?

321
00:22:08,575 --> 00:22:11,518
It's not even... It's kind of, yeah, the angles.

322
00:22:11,578 --> 00:22:14,021
It's the angles and where Keynes is too.

323
00:22:14,081 --> 00:22:16,204
That came in, yeah.

324
00:22:16,504 --> 00:22:18,747
It's all uneven over there now, yeah.

325
00:22:20,545 --> 00:22:24,466
It's just it needs to be planned appropriately.

326
00:22:24,546 --> 00:22:25,866
And there needs to be a master plan.

327
00:22:25,906 --> 00:22:27,066
And there needs to be studies done.

328
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:29,107
We haven't had the studies done.

329
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:29,987
I agree with the studies.

330
00:22:30,007 --> 00:22:36,428
So again, and I think that we should focus on those areas, not so much on building just housing density.

331
00:22:37,088 --> 00:22:37,649
Good answer.

332
00:22:37,729 --> 00:22:39,809
I mean, I can appreciate that.

333
00:22:41,869 --> 00:22:49,591
Next, I'm thinking about, you know, it's no secret, economic growth stagnant.

334
00:22:50,775 --> 00:22:52,760
stagnant at best in method.

335
00:22:53,141 --> 00:22:53,743
It just is.

336
00:22:55,086 --> 00:22:56,389
So what would be our approach?

337
00:22:59,062 --> 00:23:07,403
you know, getting growth going and let's say, how do you fix the tax base or how do you grow it?

338
00:23:07,804 --> 00:23:08,504
That's a good question.

339
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:20,526
I really do think that, again, that goes back to planning and working with different departments, the Chamber of Commerce, the planning department at City Hall.

340
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:23,446
We need to look at ways to bring in new business.

341
00:23:24,427 --> 00:23:26,387
I don't know if there's a lot of

342
00:23:28,292 --> 00:23:31,934
regulation or barriers for people starting small businesses here.

343
00:23:32,674 --> 00:23:40,057
I do know that we have 64 liquor licenses for restaurants and only 28 are being used.

344
00:23:40,257 --> 00:23:40,617
Wow.

345
00:23:41,157 --> 00:23:41,578
So.

346
00:23:41,898 --> 00:23:42,318
Wow.

347
00:23:42,678 --> 00:23:42,938
Yeah.

348
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:44,139
I think that's pretty accurate.

349
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:44,299
Yeah.

350
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:47,720
It's about 60 and we're only about 28 are being used.

351
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,641
So a lot of restaurants can come in.

352
00:23:49,801 --> 00:23:50,041
Yeah.

353
00:23:50,221 --> 00:23:50,461
Yeah.

354
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:51,562
That's interesting.

355
00:23:51,822 --> 00:23:53,102
So I didn't know that.

356
00:23:56,035 --> 00:23:57,736
I think there's a lot of opportunity there.

357
00:23:58,496 --> 00:24:07,879
I also think we need to make our squares more welcoming.

358
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:18,423
If you look at Melrose Square, even Arlington, Winchester, a lot of the surroundings, there's conformity.

359
00:24:19,782 --> 00:24:20,062
Right?

360
00:24:20,082 --> 00:24:21,963
Very much.

361
00:24:22,284 --> 00:24:25,286
They make it very welcoming, and you want to be there.

362
00:24:25,306 --> 00:24:26,666
Yep.

363
00:24:26,726 --> 00:24:30,069
If you look at Medford Square, there's no conformity.

364
00:24:30,349 --> 00:24:30,909
Right.

365
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:32,390
I know we have a sign ordinance.

366
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,091
The sign ordinance is not followed.

367
00:24:35,992 --> 00:24:37,114
You need to make it welcoming.

368
00:24:37,194 --> 00:24:38,075
You need to clean them up.

369
00:24:38,255 --> 00:24:39,637
And there's small things that can be done.

370
00:24:39,677 --> 00:24:40,198
Clean them up.

371
00:24:40,739 --> 00:24:48,929
Plants, flowers, more lights, working on the signs, cleaning up the windows, just making it more inviting.

372
00:24:49,109 --> 00:24:50,151
I think we go a long way.

373
00:24:51,312 --> 00:24:53,095
And there's no reason why we shouldn't be attracting

374
00:24:55,198 --> 00:24:59,964
restaurants and small business with the Chevalier Theater.

375
00:25:00,024 --> 00:25:04,890
It's funny you said Melrose, because I don't know what it is, but I go there sometimes.

376
00:25:05,231 --> 00:25:07,153
Actually, I go there quite a bit.

377
00:25:07,874 --> 00:25:12,520
And it's like, the word, it's pleasing to the eyes.

378
00:25:13,521 --> 00:25:21,868
Plenty of parking and behind everything and it's just like, you know, you walk around you go to a restaurant They got all the little it's just a nice environment.

379
00:25:22,048 --> 00:25:33,277
Yeah, and it's very very it's clean and it's just pleasing Mrs. Murphy's just look at the outside of the buildings, right?

380
00:25:33,417 --> 00:25:34,758
Yeah, they look good.

381
00:25:34,958 --> 00:25:36,319
No, I know and we need to

382
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,841
Conformity, I love that word.

383
00:25:40,862 --> 00:25:45,263
For the buildings, for... And they get people in.

384
00:25:45,503 --> 00:25:49,125
You know, I talked to the owner of the Altacuba, he's doing well.

385
00:25:49,345 --> 00:25:50,265
And that's the other thing.

386
00:25:50,305 --> 00:25:52,386
So you are good at

387
00:25:56,064 --> 00:25:57,546
And I don't know if this gets done or not.

388
00:25:57,566 --> 00:25:59,229
You talk to the business owners.

389
00:26:00,531 --> 00:26:01,432
You talk to them.

390
00:26:01,553 --> 00:26:08,123
So I would think that they have valuable opinions that

391
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:10,483
you know, can be used.

392
00:26:10,543 --> 00:26:12,624
And I don't know if that's coming across.

393
00:26:13,224 --> 00:26:14,345
I mean, I don't know.

394
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:20,507
I mean, I know a few of the guys that own businesses in Meffitt, but I mean, to me, that's important too, right?

395
00:26:21,327 --> 00:26:21,647
You know?

396
00:26:21,867 --> 00:26:24,528
I mean, in restaurants, I mean, there's other types of businesses that we can bring into.

397
00:26:24,688 --> 00:26:24,908
Right.

398
00:26:24,928 --> 00:26:26,189
It's just not restaurants.

399
00:26:26,229 --> 00:26:28,249
But I think we all agree that we want more restaurants.

400
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:29,890
Oh, no doubt about it.

401
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:30,210
Yeah.

402
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:32,811
I like what we have, but yeah, we can use some more.

403
00:26:32,871 --> 00:26:33,071
Yeah.

404
00:26:33,431 --> 00:26:34,331
Livens up things.

405
00:26:36,272 --> 00:26:48,344
All right, so if elected or when you get elected, what would your priorities, just for the city council, what priorities would you bring to the city council?

406
00:26:48,765 --> 00:26:52,088
I know you mentioned a lot of great things, but is there anything?

407
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:56,012
Well, depending on where the zoning goes, I bring in the zoning.

408
00:26:57,603 --> 00:26:57,823
Right.

409
00:26:58,003 --> 00:27:03,767
I would really look into our infrastructure and where we stand with our roads and our squares.

410
00:27:03,787 --> 00:27:07,970
Uh, you know, there's been a street, you know, a comprehensive street plan.

411
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:17,697
We hired two new people to in the DPW or there was an override to hire two new people to fix our streets and our sidewalks.

412
00:27:18,738 --> 00:27:20,779
Um, really figure out where that's going.

413
00:27:21,259 --> 00:27:25,122
Um, take a good look at the budget and see, well,

414
00:27:25,788 --> 00:27:28,271
Yeah, I could see you taking a good look at the budget.

415
00:27:29,032 --> 00:27:29,873
No, I could.

416
00:27:29,893 --> 00:27:30,614
You're good with that.

417
00:27:30,634 --> 00:27:31,835
I could see you.

418
00:27:32,556 --> 00:27:35,560
I would look at our pilot programs, too.

419
00:27:36,561 --> 00:27:41,046
Our pilot programs, I don't know if we're getting the most out of them and if we're

420
00:27:42,409 --> 00:27:42,729
Right.

421
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:44,131
Using them as much as possible.

422
00:27:44,151 --> 00:27:47,774
Yeah, we just had one with a couple of businesses, small business, yeah.

423
00:27:47,794 --> 00:27:52,078
I mean, Tufts, you know, Tufts, I don't know if their pilot program has increased over the years.

424
00:27:52,278 --> 00:27:52,558
Right.

425
00:27:52,578 --> 00:27:56,101
There's other non-profits that we could be tapping into.

426
00:27:56,121 --> 00:27:57,683
Right, yeah, yeah, yeah.

427
00:27:57,903 --> 00:28:00,145
Well, I appreciate that, good answers.

428
00:28:00,365 --> 00:28:05,229
A lot of valuable information coming out tonight, Melanie, you know?

429
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:07,952
Good stuff, good stuff.

430
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:26,532
All right, so now a personal question, I call it a personal question, it isn't really, but I'm gonna ask you, I ask this to everybody, your least favorite, and then give me your most favorite things to do in Method.

431
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:30,695
All right, I would say my least favorite is food shopping.

432
00:28:33,081 --> 00:28:35,843
I'm not a fan of the majority of the food stores.

433
00:28:36,123 --> 00:28:37,163
Okay in Medford.

434
00:28:37,263 --> 00:28:41,466
Yeah, I will frequent Wegmans I think they're very expensive stop-and-shop.

435
00:28:41,506 --> 00:28:54,152
I don't really go to it all and I will go to Whole Foods I'm usually at Trader Joe's or Market Basket I'd say that's my least favorite So I don't really yeah, I don't food shop in Medford at all And my

436
00:28:59,502 --> 00:29:02,124
It's kind of a combo, most favorite, least favorite.

437
00:29:02,144 --> 00:29:03,365
I walk all the time.

438
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:10,972
I love that we are so close to the Mystic River, which, by the way, I think we should be taking more advantage of that, which we're not.

439
00:29:11,492 --> 00:29:24,303
And actually, the RFP for the three buildings that came in really didn't take into account how to take advantage of our waterfront, which was disappointing to me.

440
00:29:25,974 --> 00:29:26,894
But I love walking.

441
00:29:26,914 --> 00:29:29,236
I walk along the river and the Mystic all the time.

442
00:29:30,316 --> 00:29:30,696
I love it.

443
00:29:30,716 --> 00:29:31,917
I love watching the birds.

444
00:29:32,317 --> 00:29:40,923
But it's also the worst part because our sidewalks... I mean, I end up walking in the street all the time because the sidewalks are awful.

445
00:29:41,543 --> 00:29:42,644
I've tripped a couple of times.

446
00:29:42,704 --> 00:29:44,645
I've actually fell a couple of times on the sidewalks.

447
00:29:47,618 --> 00:29:51,379
my dog pulled me once and I fell because there was a lip in it and ended up getting black eye.

448
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:58,181
So, yeah, but so, but yeah, I'm familiar with that experience falling with the dog.

449
00:29:58,201 --> 00:29:58,442
Yeah.

450
00:29:58,702 --> 00:29:58,922
Yeah.

451
00:29:59,022 --> 00:30:01,543
And not only, you know, it was a very embarrassing.

452
00:30:01,603 --> 00:30:02,683
It is embarrassing.

453
00:30:02,883 --> 00:30:05,504
I had a young couple pull over in a car.

454
00:30:05,564 --> 00:30:14,007
I mean, as you know, I live on, on, on, um, local street and I always, you know, I tend to walk towards the rink, the hockey rinks there.

455
00:30:14,727 --> 00:30:15,107
And, um,

456
00:30:16,418 --> 00:30:21,884
I don't know what's going on with the rink, the area, but that needs some work to clean up around there.

457
00:30:22,024 --> 00:30:26,309
I mean the sidewalks over there are just, it's unbelievable.

458
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:31,435
And Medford Square, I don't even like walking in the square during

459
00:30:33,376 --> 00:30:46,703
uh... on mondays yeah because the trash so our businesses put the trash out in the front of the uh... which i don't like because i'm always afraid that i'll come across some critters that i don't want to see you know you would think there would be a better way to do that because there's gotta be a better way

460
00:30:47,827 --> 00:30:48,768
Yeah, it's a good point.

461
00:30:49,128 --> 00:30:50,028
I noticed that, too.

462
00:30:50,068 --> 00:30:53,330
They do, when they put the trash out, boxes and all that.

463
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:54,271
Tons of trash barrels.

464
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:55,231
It just doesn't look too good.

465
00:30:55,251 --> 00:30:56,132
It doesn't look good at all.

466
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:58,173
So I try to avoid the square on Monday nights.

467
00:30:58,193 --> 00:30:59,433
Yeah, that's a good point.

468
00:30:59,914 --> 00:31:02,535
How could you avoid that?

469
00:31:03,196 --> 00:31:04,837
But yeah, this is all good stuff.

470
00:31:04,917 --> 00:31:07,798
I mean, I can go on for another hour with you.

471
00:31:07,878 --> 00:31:10,540
But unfortunately, we can't.

472
00:31:12,261 --> 00:31:14,622
But yeah, that's all good stuff.

473
00:31:14,702 --> 00:31:16,043
And a lot of the small stuff.

474
00:31:17,235 --> 00:31:18,415
is easy stuff to do.

475
00:31:18,475 --> 00:31:19,416
It doesn't take much.

476
00:31:19,456 --> 00:31:21,736
No, there's a lot of small stuff that can be done.

477
00:31:21,756 --> 00:31:26,898
I think following through on our ordinances would be a huge help.

478
00:31:27,698 --> 00:31:35,921
There's a lot of ordinances that are not enforced, which could bring in additional revenue.

479
00:31:36,141 --> 00:31:39,282
It's not going to be huge, but it could bring in additional revenue.

480
00:31:39,802 --> 00:31:42,603
And it could also straighten out some of the situations.

481
00:31:42,703 --> 00:31:43,123
I hear you.

482
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:44,535
All right.

483
00:31:44,595 --> 00:31:52,580
Well, you know, I could go on, like I said, for hours, but we got to get to the last question, you know, and it's probably the most important question of the night.

484
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,060
OK.

485
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:53,420
All right.

486
00:31:53,841 --> 00:32:00,765
Someone wants to reach out to Melanie Tringali, whatever, help with the campaign, you know, anything.

487
00:32:01,525 --> 00:32:02,406
How would they reach you?

488
00:32:03,346 --> 00:32:09,870
So I do have a Facebook page that they can reach out to Melanie Tringali from City Council, I believe it is.

489

So, let's thank Melanie, you know, for joining us on Method Happenings.

511
00:33:15,363 --> 00:33:21,606
And I want to thank her for being a candidate for our Memphis City Council, as she explained earlier.

512
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:22,006
It does.

513
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:24,647
It takes a lot to run.

514
00:33:26,167 --> 00:33:32,790
So I also want to take a minute before we close out to thank everyone who has been watching the show.

515
00:33:33,951 --> 00:33:34,611
We're growing.

516
00:33:34,911 --> 00:33:37,352

517
00:33:37,912 --> 00:33:39,933
And I want to thank you for your feedback.

00:33:40,553 --> 00:33:42,534
