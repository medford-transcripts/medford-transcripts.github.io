[SPEAKER_14]: Zooming in from Chicago, glad we still have him.

28
00:01:50,297 --> 00:01:56,360
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we also have Gabe Weising, who is our newest graduate student intern in our office.

[SPEAKER_14]: I believe that is everybody tonight.

30
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

31
00:02:05,741 --> 00:02:08,302
[SPEAKER_03]: So for our first item, let's see.

32
00:02:16,864 --> 00:02:20,185
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe our first item this evening is approval not required.

33
00:02:21,005 --> 00:02:23,466
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an ANR, which I plan for review.

34
00:02:24,266 --> 00:02:26,347
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's seven and nine Jeremiah circle.

35
00:02:27,502 --> 00:02:32,406
[SPEAKER_03]: At this time, I'm going to provide the proponents of the plans, the 79 Jeremiah Circle.

36
00:02:33,847 --> 00:02:38,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Danielle, can you give access to screen share?

37
00:02:40,972 --> 00:02:42,193
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see.

38
00:02:42,874 --> 00:02:46,136
[SPEAKER_14]: First, I want to check if the applicant is here.

39
00:02:46,156 --> 00:02:50,840
[SPEAKER_14]: I got an email not too long ago.

40
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,242
[SPEAKER_14]: It's having trouble.

41
00:03:00,087 --> 00:03:08,806
[SPEAKER_03]: That's okay to keep that what I can do is we'll see if we'll just move it to another portion of the meeting later.

42
00:03:12,061 --> 00:03:18,085
[SPEAKER_03]: And at this time, I'll see if 400 mystic adversary for special permit site plan review.

43
00:03:19,005 --> 00:03:30,392
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe because we don't have a full voting body this evening, we will be listening to a presentation by the proponent because there will be a site plan review revision that's needed.

44
00:03:30,492 --> 00:03:40,078
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will at this time, read the public hearing notice before the proponent can make, before the city makes introductory comments.

45
00:03:41,687 --> 00:03:45,515
[SPEAKER_03]: The Medford Community Development Board shall conduct a public hearing on June 5th, 2024 at 630.

46
00:03:47,661 --> 00:04:12,145
[SPEAKER_03]: PM via Zoom, relative to an application by Herb Chambers, 400 Mystic LLC, 400 Mystic Avenue LLC for site plan review to permit the construction of a new three-story structure to replace the existing three-story structure, renovation of the existing five-story structure, along with the modifications of existing parking, vehicle circulation, landscape, and utilities associated with proposed Herb Chambers-Toyota-Boston

47
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:18,516
[SPEAKER_03]: In addition, the proposal requires special permits for the following motor vehicle-related uses as applicable.

48
00:04:19,396 --> 00:04:26,122
[SPEAKER_03]: H3, motor vehicle sales or rental of new vehicles only, accessory storage entirely within enclosed structure.

49
00:04:26,702 --> 00:04:30,786
[SPEAKER_03]: H4, outdoor motor vehicle sales and storage accessory to H3.

50
00:04:31,126 --> 00:04:34,148
[SPEAKER_03]: And H6, class two used motor vehicle sales.

51
00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:41,174
[SPEAKER_03]: The property is located in the commercial two, which is C2 zone district of 400 Basic Avenue, Redmond, Mass.

52
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:51,122
[SPEAKER_03]: And at this time, I'm gonna ask the staff to make introductory comments before inviting the board to present the proposal.

53
00:04:51,142 --> 00:04:52,022
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

54
00:04:52,742 --> 00:05:02,624
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, this is a proposal that requires a special permit for the motor vehicle sales of new vehicles.

55
00:05:02,724 --> 00:05:10,746
[SPEAKER_14]: There was question of whether they needed the special permit for the used vehicles, but I think we clarified that that's not actually needed

56
00:05:12,897 --> 00:05:36,225
[SPEAKER_14]: But I'll let the applicant opine on whether they still want to pursue that, because there's a, our use table, the primary use just speaks about new vehicles only, but that's not a typical arrangement in vehicle sales, that there's always used cars or pre-owned.

57
00:05:36,245 --> 00:05:40,086
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm not sure if we want to cover our bases by,

58
00:05:43,818 --> 00:05:47,763
[SPEAKER_14]: also approving use number H6.

59
00:05:50,246 --> 00:06:01,660
[SPEAKER_14]: But besides that, they also need a special permit for the outdoor motor vehicle sales and storage that's accessory to H3, which is the new car sales.

60
00:06:04,017 --> 00:06:27,552
[SPEAKER_14]: they already received a variance from the Zoning Board of Appeals for height, which clears the way for this board to approve a site plan since they were able to obtain those variances so that it's compliant with the zoning now that it's been buried.

61
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:32,612
[SPEAKER_14]: This has been circulated to the various department heads.

62
00:06:33,313 --> 00:06:37,515
[SPEAKER_14]: We received comments back, met with the applicant team.

63
00:06:37,535 --> 00:06:42,358
[SPEAKER_14]: The applicant team has met with some of the department heads and we'll start to incorporate some of the changes.

64
00:06:42,498 --> 00:06:53,184
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think tonight will be a presentation asking about the revisions that will be being made and input from the board of any of the further revisions.

65
00:07:00,202 --> 00:07:02,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

66
00:07:03,285 --> 00:07:12,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I actually now invite you to introduce yourselves and make sure that we have sharing facilities for them?

67
00:07:17,257 --> 00:07:19,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening, Chairperson McPherson, can you hear me?

68
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, can hear you.

69
00:07:21,721 --> 00:07:22,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you want me to proceed?

70
00:07:22,682 --> 00:07:23,143
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

71
00:07:23,163 --> 00:07:24,504
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, you can go right ahead.

72
00:07:25,071 --> 00:07:28,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you and thank Danielle for that summary as well.

73
00:07:28,957 --> 00:07:35,266
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Frank Marinelli, just for the record, and I'm a land use attorney with offices at 439 Washington Street in Braintree.

74
00:07:36,506 --> 00:07:41,890
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've had the privilege of representing Mr. Chambers in his various developments for over 25 years.

75
00:07:42,531 --> 00:07:56,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Tonight, just by way of background, we're proposing significant investment and improvement at the 400 Mystic property, specifically transformation of the commercial two property to Herb Chambers Toyota.

76
00:07:56,902 --> 00:08:09,808
[SPEAKER_05]: With me, Chairperson McPherson is the Director of Construction for the Herb Chambers Companies, John Welch, and also here is our civil engineering team, Gabe Crocker and Dave Newhall of Crocker Design Group.

77
00:08:11,048 --> 00:08:14,189
[SPEAKER_05]: They prepared the engineered site plans that you have before you.

78
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:17,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Also here, our architect, Lee Hemingway,

79
00:08:18,402 --> 00:08:24,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Regent Associates who prepared the floor plans and the elevations that you have in the record as well.

80
00:08:24,787 --> 00:08:36,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Also here is Julie Lucier of Ryan Associates and Julie prepared the very nice landscape plan that we've submitted with all the new plantings and preservation of existing trees.

81
00:08:36,837 --> 00:08:43,103
[SPEAKER_05]: So at the conclusion of our presentation we're happy to answer any questions the board or the public may have.

82
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:45,625
[SPEAKER_05]: Just by way of company background for

83
00:08:46,345 --> 00:08:55,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Over the past 40 years, Mr. Chambers has built a major regional business, which entails approximately 60 motor vehicle dealerships employing over 1,500 people.

84
00:08:56,556 --> 00:09:00,380
[SPEAKER_05]: The company has been named by the Boston Globe as one of the best places to work.

85
00:09:00,961 --> 00:09:07,748
[SPEAKER_05]: All of Chambers facilities are neatly maintained under the direction of corporate manager, John Welch, who's here with us tonight.

86
00:09:08,437 --> 00:09:16,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Concerning the property itself, as the board knows, it's a 4.86 acre site located in the commercial two zone.

87
00:09:16,303 --> 00:09:20,707
[SPEAKER_05]: It has a large building, formerly Century Bank headquarters.

88
00:09:20,847 --> 00:09:29,354
[SPEAKER_05]: That building is comprised of a five-story tower office section that was used for banking offices approved for a height variance from the zoning board in 2001.

89
00:09:29,394 --> 00:09:34,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Then there is another older three-story section to the north,

90
00:09:35,132 --> 00:09:45,277
[SPEAKER_05]: That old three-story section would be demolished as part of the Herb Chambers project, and we've already processed and received the demolition permit for the three-story section.

91
00:09:45,797 --> 00:09:55,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Three years ago, just as a matter of background, Herb Chambers, 400 Mystic LLC, the entity acquired the commercial property for $20.5 million.

92
00:09:57,603 --> 00:10:12,007
[SPEAKER_05]: The property, as you know, is uniquely surrounded on every side by roadway, road network, including the I-93 ramp, I-93 itself to the east, and then Fulbright to the north, Mystic to the west.

93
00:10:12,967 --> 00:10:21,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Our proposal that you see in the plans is to first renovate the four floors of the five-story tower section.

94
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:35,720
[SPEAKER_05]: In those first four floors, we will have display and showroom of motor vehicles along with sales and finance offices and customer amenities that are shown on the file floor plans and the elevations.

95
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:40,683
[SPEAKER_05]: The footprint of the existing five-story tower stays as existing.

96
00:10:41,503 --> 00:11:08,326
[SPEAKER_05]: In addition to renovating the five-story tower section, the project involves, as I said, demolishing the old three-story section to the north, and we're building a new three-story section which is comprised of approximately 40 customer service bays on the first floor, and then interior parking on the second and third floors for over 200 cars, approximately 106 cars on each of the second and third floors, also as shown on the five-floor plans.

97
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,582
[SPEAKER_05]: The total addition is about 125,775 square feet.

98
00:11:15,563 --> 00:11:28,290
[SPEAKER_05]: There is also constructed a car elevator, and the car elevator is between the new three-story section to the north and the existing five-story building.

99
00:11:29,031 --> 00:11:36,575
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the car elevator which will transport cars to all levels and showrooms in the existing five-story building.

100
00:11:37,662 --> 00:11:46,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Conversion and improvement to the building is an approximate $30 million investment in MedFed in addition to the over $20 million acquisition.

101
00:11:46,768 --> 00:11:50,810
[SPEAKER_05]: The project will also create about 50 to 75 new jobs.

102
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:52,731
[SPEAKER_05]: As Danielle mentioned on

103
00:11:54,835 --> 00:12:00,399
[SPEAKER_05]: May 30th, last week, the Zoning Board of Appeals voted unanimous approval for the project to proceed.

104
00:12:01,239 --> 00:12:08,164
[SPEAKER_05]: The height limitation, as you probably know, in the Z2 zone is an infeasible two stories and 30 feet.

105
00:12:08,624 --> 00:12:12,127
[SPEAKER_05]: There already exists on the property three stories and five-story height.

106
00:12:12,227 --> 00:12:21,353
[SPEAKER_05]: So the Zoning Board granted the reasonable relief to allow the new three-story section and the car elevator to connect to the existing five-story building.

107
00:12:22,574 --> 00:12:37,325
[SPEAKER_05]: For the CDB's jurisdiction, as Danielle pointed out, we're requesting the grant of special permits under the principal use table, which is categories H3 and H4, as Danielle mentioned.

108
00:12:37,885 --> 00:12:41,628
[SPEAKER_05]: H6 is really when you have a principal use of a used car lot.

109
00:12:41,688 --> 00:12:42,969
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not the case here.

110
00:12:43,369 --> 00:12:45,351
[SPEAKER_05]: We're a Class 1 licensee.

111
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:50,372
[SPEAKER_05]: under Chapter 140, Section 58 of Mass General Laws.

112
00:12:50,552 --> 00:12:58,935
[SPEAKER_05]: And basically, when you apply for and receive a Class 1 license, you are automatically entitled to sell pre-owned vehicles as well.

113
00:12:59,555 --> 00:13:04,596
[SPEAKER_05]: So, excuse me, that would be pretty much included in the H3 and H4.

114
00:13:05,256 --> 00:13:10,458
[SPEAKER_05]: And we appreciate the all-inclusiveness of the ad that was published.

115
00:13:11,923 --> 00:13:25,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Just, again, on the use and the importance and the benefits of the proposed use, even though it's a change of use, the five-story building is a significant existing condition on the property.

116
00:13:26,249 --> 00:13:41,076
[SPEAKER_05]: And we believe the best way to repurpose the existing building is our core use of the Herb Chambers Company's an additional $30 million redevelopment investment method to create an owner-occupied state-of-the-art dealership.

117
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:49,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Herb Chambers sales and display in the five story building and a new service center and interior parking in the new three story building.

118
00:13:50,683 --> 00:14:04,667
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't believe that the best use is trying to rent the building as is as office space to disparate users, particularly where office buildings, as you know, are facing increased vacancy nationwide and in the greater Boston market.

119
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:11,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Other benefits to the proposed use, Herb Chambers and Toyota are two strong brands.

120
00:14:12,454 --> 00:14:14,055
[SPEAKER_05]: One comprehensive dealership use.

121
00:14:14,835 --> 00:14:17,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Toyota has been a leader with electric vehicles.

122
00:14:18,178 --> 00:14:21,640
[SPEAKER_05]: And as I said, the investment represents and augments

123
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:32,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Medford's commercial tax base in the TC2 zone creates new jobs and results in less traffic and vehicle trips as compared to the former office building and bank use of the property.

124
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:50,408
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have a traffic report in the record that was prepared by Chapel Associates and on page 25, in the conclusions, it talks about quote, on a typical weekday, the dealership is projected to generate 686 fewer trips than as of right bank and office use.

125
00:14:51,228 --> 00:14:54,029
[SPEAKER_05]: end quote, of the property, the prior uses.

126
00:14:55,089 --> 00:15:00,611
[SPEAKER_05]: We also consume less water and sewer than the former office building type use.

127
00:15:01,352 --> 00:15:06,353
[SPEAKER_05]: There are also stormwater management and treatment improvements that our engineers will talk about.

128
00:15:07,034 --> 00:15:11,135
[SPEAKER_05]: As I stated, three stories exist at the site, five stories exist at the site.

129
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:16,977
[SPEAKER_05]: So the height of the car elevator connected to the five stories is consistent with what already exists on the site.

130
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:21,536
[SPEAKER_05]: and the project is consistent with the C2 zoning purpose.

131
00:15:22,917 --> 00:15:30,482
[SPEAKER_05]: The project is also consistent with nearby commercial uses in the C2, which I'm sure the board is familiar with.

132
00:15:30,942 --> 00:15:40,029
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an area of mixed industrial, warehouse, automotive, and retail, includes uses like Jason's Trucks, Tractor Trailer Storage, C's Gas Station,

133
00:15:40,529 --> 00:15:48,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Millennium Maintenance, Power Sweeping, Foreign Domestic Auto, Colonial Volkswagen, AutoZone, Public Storage, Dunkin Donuts, and many others.

134
00:15:48,996 --> 00:15:53,340
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's improvement and no substantial detriment to the neighborhood.

135
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:57,924
[SPEAKER_05]: We would respectfully submit with the investment in Medford that's represented by

136
00:15:58,684 --> 00:16:00,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Herb Chambers and Herb Chambers Toyota.

137
00:16:02,007 --> 00:16:09,252
[SPEAKER_05]: Yesterday, as Danielle mentioned, we had a productive review session with Danielle Evans, the senior planner.

138
00:16:09,292 --> 00:16:21,060
[SPEAKER_05]: We also had a productive review session with Todd Blake, the city transportation engineer, and we'll be incorporating suggestions into a revised plan set for the special permit and site plan review.

139
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:34,423
[SPEAKER_05]: At this point, I'd like to thank you and the board for your attention, Chairperson McPherson, and if it's okay, I can turn it over to our engineering term for just a discussion of the site layout.

140
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:38,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Attorney March.

141
00:16:38,884 --> 00:16:40,864
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, Attorney Marnell, yes.

142
00:16:44,025 --> 00:16:44,865
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, thanks Frank.

143
00:16:45,885 --> 00:16:50,866
[SPEAKER_08]: So David Newhall of Crocker Design Group for the record, site civil engineers for the project.

144
00:16:51,892 --> 00:17:09,639
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, as Frank had mentioned, uh, the existing site, um, which we're showing here with our existing conditions plan, um, which we prepared, um, our land surveying department went out, did an on the ground field survey, and that is stamped by, um, Shane Brenner, our registered professional land surveyor.

145
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,361
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, the existing site is about 4.87 acres, um, has the existing,

146
00:17:16,506 --> 00:17:25,073
[SPEAKER_08]: big building that has the three-story building and then the addition that was put on in the 2000s for the five-story building.

147
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:29,997
[SPEAKER_08]: The site currently has three access points.

148
00:17:30,537 --> 00:17:37,382
[SPEAKER_08]: There's two curb cuts, one on Fulbright Street, I mean two on Fulbright Street and one on Mystic Ave.

149
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:45,989
[SPEAKER_08]: The two Fulbright Street curb cuts are full access so they have in and out permitted with both

150
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:51,470
[SPEAKER_08]: curb cuts, and then our Mystic Ave curb cut is exit only.

151
00:17:51,831 --> 00:18:00,720
[SPEAKER_08]: So the site when it was utilized as a bank building, everybody would enter the site off of Fulbright.

152
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:07,327
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a drive-through for banking needs here that then exits through an exit only onto Mystic Ave.

153
00:18:09,649 --> 00:18:11,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Newhall, I apologize.

154
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:13,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have something else that's to scale just for the public?

155
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:20,399
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can follow along, but I'm not sure that everyone's going to have an easy enough time following along.

156
00:18:20,439 --> 00:18:22,021
[SPEAKER_03]: This is hugely engineering.

157
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:29,468
[SPEAKER_03]: And I understand that as yourself as an engineer, but I'm not sure that anyone's able to follow along from the public.

158
00:18:30,649 --> 00:18:30,889
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

159
00:18:33,244 --> 00:18:36,805
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you, I guess that was what we had for our existing conditions plan.

160
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:38,625
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't we just go with the site layout plan?

161
00:18:39,025 --> 00:18:40,826
[SPEAKER_08]: Might be a little bit easier for us to follow.

162
00:18:42,726 --> 00:18:43,386
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry about that.

163
00:18:48,747 --> 00:18:49,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, this helps.

164
00:18:49,687 --> 00:18:49,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

165
00:18:49,987 --> 00:18:50,688
[SPEAKER_08]: It is easier.

166
00:18:50,888 --> 00:18:51,248
[SPEAKER_08]: Perfect.

167
00:18:52,368 --> 00:18:57,769
[SPEAKER_08]: So the existing site, we're going to keep that five story.

168
00:18:58,445 --> 00:19:02,926
[SPEAKER_08]: tower building, the existing three story building will be removed.

169
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:13,469
[SPEAKER_08]: We're showing the footprint of a proposed three story building that as Frank mentioned will contain the service and storage of automobiles.

170
00:19:14,249 --> 00:19:17,630
[SPEAKER_08]: There was the existing mystic F curb cut.

171
00:19:19,186 --> 00:19:21,709
[SPEAKER_08]: is roughly in this area here.

172
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:34,203
[SPEAKER_08]: We're proposing to move that curb cut further to the west, just to align this curb cut with the service reception area.

173
00:19:34,664 --> 00:19:38,208
[SPEAKER_08]: So when a customer comes to the site,

174
00:19:38,593 --> 00:20:00,948
[SPEAKER_08]: and they're bringing their vehicle for service, they will enter the site off of Mystic Gap and be able to drive directly into the building, into service reception, where they'll drop their vehicle off, head into the building, and then a valet will take the vehicle and bring it to where it needs to go within the building, whether it be to service or to storage.

175
00:20:01,108 --> 00:20:06,932
[SPEAKER_08]: Additionally, if somebody is accessing the site and is coming there for a new vehicle purchase,

176
00:20:07,322 --> 00:20:21,791
[SPEAKER_08]: They can enter the site and immediately take a right and park in front of the five story building or in any of the other open spaces on site but out front is where these spaces will be reserved for customers.

177
00:20:23,212 --> 00:20:28,375
[SPEAKER_08]: We are also proposing to retain the two curb cuts along Fulbright Street.

178
00:20:29,182 --> 00:20:38,847
[SPEAKER_08]: We have received some feedback from Todd Blake that we are in the process of incorporating in regards to these curb cuts and some potential modifications.

179
00:20:39,347 --> 00:20:47,691
[SPEAKER_08]: But the goal is to keep these two curb cuts to provide full access in and out of the site along Fulbright.

180
00:20:48,111 --> 00:20:55,515
[SPEAKER_08]: This back access here will mainly be used for employees and for delivery vehicles.

181
00:20:56,095 --> 00:20:58,157
[SPEAKER_08]: to access the site back here.

182
00:20:58,237 --> 00:21:05,042
[SPEAKER_08]: So customers will be using the Mystic Ave curb cut, and then the back curb cut will be used by employees.

183
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:15,190
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the first curb cut along Fulbright Street may be used by customers, but mostly will be used by employees and other delivery vehicles to access the site.

184
00:21:17,792 --> 00:21:19,734
[SPEAKER_08]: Additionally, as Frank

185
00:21:20,252 --> 00:21:27,057
[SPEAKER_08]: had mentioned there is on-site stormwater that is subsurface that is located out in the front parking area.

186
00:21:27,437 --> 00:21:32,961
[SPEAKER_08]: We are going to retain those two subsurface detention systems.

187
00:21:33,702 --> 00:21:44,970
[SPEAKER_08]: The site generally drains within a series of catch basins today and goes to either these two detention basins or to the grass swale that is along

188
00:21:45,895 --> 00:21:48,919
[SPEAKER_08]: the southern portion of the property into the east.

189
00:21:49,539 --> 00:22:04,156
[SPEAKER_08]: There's some stormwater that does flow overland to the grass well to the north, all of which then drains to a reinforced concrete pipe that adds under the I-93 off ramp at exit 21.

190
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:14,652
[SPEAKER_08]: And our proposal is to retain those two systems and then also propose a third system to the rear parking area here.

191
00:22:15,153 --> 00:22:26,103
[SPEAKER_08]: All of our stormwater will still drain towards the same location, but we are reducing the rate in which stormwater is headed that way and also increasing the treatment.

192
00:22:28,405 --> 00:22:30,047
[SPEAKER_08]: Additionally, we proposed

193
00:22:33,067 --> 00:22:36,928
[SPEAKER_08]: 292 parking spaces based off the comments we've received from Danielle.

194
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:43,709
[SPEAKER_08]: We're in the process of altering our parking to the east of the building.

195
00:22:44,549 --> 00:22:49,630
[SPEAKER_08]: In particular, we're adding some more landscape islands to break up some of this parking.

196
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:54,951
[SPEAKER_08]: So some of those changes we're working on now based off that feedback, the proposal is for 292 spaces.

197
00:22:54,971 --> 00:22:56,271
[SPEAKER_08]: The existing site has 314 parking spaces.

198
00:23:05,388 --> 00:23:09,670
[SPEAKER_08]: For building and circulation within the building, Lee, we'll get to that later.

199
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:15,732
[SPEAKER_08]: But for the most part, we'll have employee parking and access to the rear.

200
00:23:16,252 --> 00:23:21,054
[SPEAKER_08]: Customers will be out front and then inventory spacing here where you see the stacked parking.

201
00:23:21,968 --> 00:23:29,332
[SPEAKER_08]: We have also met with the fire department about the circulation around our site and our fire protection measures.

202
00:23:29,552 --> 00:23:33,974
[SPEAKER_08]: They gave us some preliminary feedback a few months ago.

203
00:23:34,995 --> 00:23:42,978
[SPEAKER_08]: We have since incorporated all of their feedback in the record plans that are on file, and we've addressed all of their concerns.

204
00:23:43,399 --> 00:23:50,262
[SPEAKER_08]: So we've satisfied them for access and for fire protection, both on the site and within the building.

205
00:23:53,213 --> 00:24:05,345
[SPEAKER_08]: Additionally, we did submit our stormwater management package to the engineering department for a preliminary review and we received preliminary feedback in which we have addressed that.

206
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:15,094
[SPEAKER_08]: We will now be filing formally with their stormwater permit and they will provide an additional review of our stormwater management systems.

207
00:24:16,932 --> 00:24:28,779
[SPEAKER_08]: Additionally, for what we have shown here, we show the reconstruction of the concrete sidewalk that is along Mystic and then goes to the curb cut along Fulbright.

208
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:34,963
[SPEAKER_08]: We've reviewed this with Todd Blake and we're working on a proposal that extends this

209
00:24:35,698 --> 00:24:48,638
[SPEAKER_08]: exit the proposal for concrete sidewalk down to our second entrance to align with the concrete sidewalk that is around the building so to provide better access for employees if they're using public transportation.

210
00:24:49,727 --> 00:24:53,130
[SPEAKER_08]: Additionally, there was a comment about bicycle storage.

211
00:24:54,331 --> 00:24:58,895
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll also be providing bicycle storage to the rear of the building here.

212
00:25:00,296 --> 00:25:07,903
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the proposed area of the building in which there'll be the lunchroom and employee areas.

213
00:25:08,263 --> 00:25:09,264
[SPEAKER_08]: So employees

214
00:25:10,373 --> 00:25:12,874
[SPEAKER_08]: will be coming and leaving through this area mainly.

215
00:25:12,934 --> 00:25:20,297
[SPEAKER_08]: So we've tried to put the bicycle rack as close to where they will be entering and exiting for the day.

216
00:25:20,317 --> 00:25:32,221
[SPEAKER_08]: I think with that, probably best to turn it over to Julie of Ryan Associates to go through what we currently have for a proposed planting plan.

217
00:25:37,123 --> 00:25:37,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. Noel.

218
00:25:39,387 --> 00:25:41,329
[SPEAKER_12]: My name is Julie Lucher of Ryan Associates.

219
00:25:41,449 --> 00:25:43,611
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm the landscape architect for the project.

220
00:25:45,733 --> 00:25:49,817
[SPEAKER_12]: We've preserved as much of the existing established landscape as possible.

221
00:25:51,118 --> 00:26:02,449
[SPEAKER_12]: This includes the shrubs in Evergreen Hedge that run adjacent to 93 at the east of the property, as well as the shrubs at the southern end near the 93 exit ramp.

222
00:26:06,473 --> 00:26:07,434
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you see my cursor?

223
00:26:08,114 --> 00:26:09,175
[SPEAKER_12]: Dave can walk us along.

224
00:26:12,657 --> 00:26:14,599
[SPEAKER_12]: So those plantings are below the wall.

225
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,942
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a number of evergreen shrubs interspersed with deciduous shrubs here.

226
00:26:20,022 --> 00:26:30,730
[SPEAKER_12]: Then going up mystic, we're preserving five mature honey locust trees and infilling with two new trees to match, resulting in a more continuous canopy at the street here.

227
00:26:31,701 --> 00:26:35,702
[SPEAKER_12]: Below these trees, we're proposing a robust new understory planting.

228
00:26:36,562 --> 00:26:41,764
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a mix of ornamental grass, evergreen shrubs, and flowering deciduous shrubs.

229
00:26:42,744 --> 00:26:50,647
[SPEAKER_12]: It's about an eight foot wide bed, which widens to encompass the trees and a larger bed around the proposed pylon sign.

230
00:26:52,660 --> 00:27:04,129
[SPEAKER_12]: The planting is made up of nine or more plants, massings of nine or more plants, and it includes Ilex glabra, or inkberry, a low horizontal juniper, which will maintain a presence throughout the year.

231
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:16,640
[SPEAKER_12]: There's also pennisetum, or fountain grass, spirea, physocarpis, or ninebark, and knockout roses to bring color and interest to the planting viewed from mystic.

232
00:27:19,055 --> 00:27:35,740
[SPEAKER_12]: Moving on, at the, well, at the main, the Mystic Ave entrance, we have a formal planting with larger massings of sedum, pennisetum, a low-rugged juniper, evergreen liriope, and roost aromatica or fragrant sumac.

233
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:42,422
[SPEAKER_12]: There's bands of decorative stone around the sign as well as at the base of the three flagpoles.

234
00:27:43,742 --> 00:27:45,523
[SPEAKER_12]: And then moving up along Fulbright,

235
00:27:46,308 --> 00:27:54,590
[SPEAKER_12]: Between the two curb cuts, we have added nine slender silhouette sweetgums, which are a tall, narrow tree.

236
00:27:56,791 --> 00:28:02,432
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's an under-planting of ornamental grasses here, pennisetum and panicum, or switchgrass.

237
00:28:03,893 --> 00:28:11,575
[SPEAKER_12]: There are stone blocks that are on the site, and we are proposing to rearrange them and place them between the trees here within the grasses.

238
00:28:12,495 --> 00:28:15,776
[SPEAKER_12]: Further up on Fulbright, after the second,

239
00:28:17,122 --> 00:28:22,705
[SPEAKER_12]: Curb cut, we're maintaining the existing trees and under-planting with more ornamental grasses.

240
00:28:23,646 --> 00:28:40,757
[SPEAKER_12]: And then at the eastern edge of the back lot, at the top of the drawing here, parallel to 93, we're planting four quants and cherry trees, under-planted with evergreen shrubs, Alexaglabra, and more ornamental grasses.

241
00:28:40,777 --> 00:28:45,380
[SPEAKER_12]: And then tucked in behind the new architecture,

242
00:28:46,443 --> 00:28:47,363
[SPEAKER_12]: where the break room is.

243
00:28:47,443 --> 00:28:55,367
[SPEAKER_12]: We do have four bicycle racks there, as well as 11 emerald green or emerald sentinel junipers.

244
00:28:55,687 --> 00:29:01,510
[SPEAKER_12]: They're going to be about, we'll go in at eight to 10 feet high to give some relief to the facade from 93.

245
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:05,252
[SPEAKER_12]: There'll be turf in the rest of the area back here.

246
00:29:07,633 --> 00:29:12,635
[SPEAKER_12]: Moving to the front of the building, the entrance frame is framed by two

247
00:29:13,397 --> 00:29:24,539
[SPEAKER_12]: plant beds, each with a boxwood spine in those longer plant beds, and sedum, liriope, and penicetum, as well as spirea in these plant beds.

248
00:29:25,099 --> 00:29:30,460
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a short wall and steps making the connection along the pedestrian path here.

249
00:29:32,361 --> 00:29:39,622
[SPEAKER_12]: In the front parking lot, we have one additional Kwanson cherry tree and five honey locusts planted in the islands.

250
00:29:43,363 --> 00:29:51,705
[SPEAKER_12]: So in conclusion, our landscape plan includes eight existing trees to remain and 33 proposed trees.

251
00:29:51,725 --> 00:29:56,266
[SPEAKER_12]: 22 of them are deciduous and 11 of them are evergreen.

252
00:29:57,147 --> 00:30:04,648
[SPEAKER_12]: We have 201 shrubs that will be added in addition to the ones that we're maintaining and 396 perennials or ornamental grasses.

253
00:30:11,058 --> 00:30:13,584
[SPEAKER_12]: I can hand it off to Lee from Regent from here.

254
00:30:13,724 --> 00:30:14,065
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

255
00:30:14,085 --> 00:30:21,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Ms.

256
00:30:21,481 --> 00:30:21,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Lister.

257
00:30:25,982 --> 00:30:26,422
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, everybody.

258
00:30:26,822 --> 00:30:34,084
[SPEAKER_01]: Lee Hemingway, senior project manager with Regent Associates, and we've been working on the plans and elevations that you see.

259
00:30:36,044 --> 00:30:40,786
[SPEAKER_01]: Dave mentioned a little earlier, a little bit about kind of the flow through the building.

260
00:30:41,166 --> 00:30:43,406
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'll just quickly go through that again.

261
00:30:43,426 --> 00:30:50,248
[SPEAKER_01]: As Dave mentioned, you can drive your vehicle straight in from the main entrance directly into

262
00:30:51,528 --> 00:30:58,056
[SPEAKER_01]: the service advisors where they'll take your vehicles to get worked on.

263
00:30:58,797 --> 00:31:06,487
[SPEAKER_01]: From there, you can enter directly into your service advisors and discuss your plan of attack for your vehicle.

264
00:31:08,037 --> 00:31:13,360
[SPEAKER_01]: From there, we have a direct access into the bank building through a stairwell and a ramp.

265
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:20,663
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll find our business development center there, so people can do some work from their laptops.

266
00:31:21,123 --> 00:31:23,464
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have some big comfortable chairs there.

267
00:31:24,745 --> 00:31:29,067
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in the same area, we have a little cafe area, so you can grab your coffee or some waters or a snack.

268
00:31:31,587 --> 00:31:42,475
[SPEAKER_01]: While you're inside the bank building, we're going to have a large seating area for customers to relax, and then you can peruse all the new vehicles that they'll have in the showroom.

269
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:55,245
[SPEAKER_01]: To the right of the showroom is where they'll have the new vehicles that will be purchased, and then the staff will go over all the new perks and all of the

270
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:59,771
[SPEAKER_01]: all the features of the vehicles from that side.

271
00:32:00,011 --> 00:32:04,793
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's some sales further inside once you're in that first floor showroom.

272
00:32:07,514 --> 00:32:15,698
[SPEAKER_01]: Switching back over to the new addition, you can see that we've got our car elevator to the right side.

273
00:32:15,718 --> 00:32:20,380
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't connect on this floor, but it does connect on the upper floors.

274
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:25,342
[SPEAKER_01]: So the access through the new addition is through this location here.

275
00:32:27,961 --> 00:32:35,843
[SPEAKER_01]: Through the center of the building, we've got a two-way ramp to guide you up for parking storage on the second and third floors.

276
00:32:38,044 --> 00:32:45,666
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the far left corner of the new addition, we've got some detail bays for car washing in-house.

277
00:32:46,766 --> 00:32:52,788
[SPEAKER_01]: And directly next to that is where we have our parts department, parts storage, wholesale parts.

278
00:32:54,852 --> 00:33:05,461
[SPEAKER_01]: And then to the right of that, as Dave mentioned, we've got our break room, our staff break room and lunch room, as well as some toilets and locker rooms for them.

279
00:33:10,445 --> 00:33:12,427
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's pretty much the first floor.

280
00:33:12,447 --> 00:33:14,049
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to scroll down to the second floor.

281
00:33:17,306 --> 00:33:20,007
[SPEAKER_01]: Second floor, again, is mostly just vehicle storage.

282
00:33:20,567 --> 00:33:32,351
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a spot for a photo booth, which is on the lower left corner for taking web pictures for inventory.

283
00:33:34,136 --> 00:33:42,598
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, as I mentioned, there's the attachment to the bank building at this location where the car corridor and our car elevator.

284
00:33:43,238 --> 00:33:47,499
[SPEAKER_01]: So that will be how we'll be getting vehicles onto the second, third, and fourth floors.

285
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,360
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we've got a couple offices and some more sales.

286
00:33:57,522 --> 00:33:58,382
[SPEAKER_01]: We can go to the third floor.

287
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:02,671
[SPEAKER_01]: And the third floor, again, is very similar.

288
00:34:03,472 --> 00:34:06,614
[SPEAKER_01]: Vehicle storage on the new addition.

289
00:34:08,315 --> 00:34:10,816
[SPEAKER_01]: Car corridor and elevator to the right.

290
00:34:11,797 --> 00:34:15,720
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this floor is basically just going to be vehicle storage and displays.

291
00:34:22,524 --> 00:34:23,805
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, you can go to the fourth floor.

292
00:34:26,491 --> 00:34:40,398
[SPEAKER_01]: Similar as well, this car corridor and connector for this floor, and then some additional spaces for staff, some back of house for the Herb Chambers companies to work with, and some more vehicle displays.

293
00:34:43,339 --> 00:34:50,643
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for the fifth floor, basically, we are just proposing the car corridor connector at this time with no additional work on the fifth floor.

294
00:34:59,711 --> 00:35:02,352
[SPEAKER_01]: And the top view is what you'll see from Mystic Avenue.

295
00:35:04,313 --> 00:35:08,674
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you drive in, you'll see the service reception.

296
00:35:09,654 --> 00:35:15,016
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be out of ACM panels, the silver with the red highlight per Toyota.

297
00:35:17,177 --> 00:35:25,239
[SPEAKER_01]: So that portion and then the portion to the right, which is going to be where their service advisors and entrances is all of the same material.

298
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:26,860
[SPEAKER_01]: So that'll be all ACM.

299
00:35:29,117 --> 00:35:33,700
[SPEAKER_01]: The car elevator connector was also going to be made out of ACM, so the same material.

300
00:35:35,602 --> 00:35:39,885
[SPEAKER_01]: The bulk of the new addition will be made with insulated metal panels.

301
00:35:40,945 --> 00:35:46,209
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, the same color or very similar to what's going to be proposed for the Toyota.

302
00:35:48,891 --> 00:35:53,334
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's going to be a new portal that you'll be entering through at the bank building.

303
00:35:53,355 --> 00:35:56,277
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see like in the outlined blue there.

304
00:35:57,230 --> 00:36:00,372
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's your typical Toyota illuminated portal entrance.

305
00:36:03,454 --> 00:36:04,495
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the main entrance.

306
00:36:06,056 --> 00:36:11,400
[SPEAKER_01]: If we scroll down, this is what you'll see when you're on the exit ramp or if you're heading 93 North.

307
00:36:13,481 --> 00:36:15,803
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll see a side of the existing bank building.

308
00:36:16,363 --> 00:36:21,627
[SPEAKER_01]: And then beyond that, you'll see the new addition for service and vehicle storage.

309
00:36:28,234 --> 00:36:28,835
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

310
00:36:30,756 --> 00:36:34,560
[SPEAKER_01]: So as plenty of us have been on 93 and sitting in traffic, this is what you'll see.

311
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:37,022
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the rear of the building.

312
00:36:38,243 --> 00:36:46,631
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see we have the existing bank building, then the car corridor, five floors, and the car elevator.

313
00:36:47,331 --> 00:36:49,914
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, made out of the same ACM as the bank building.

314
00:36:50,734 --> 00:36:52,796
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the new addition to the right,

315
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:58,793
[SPEAKER_01]: This will be all out of insulated metal panels, which is, again, the same kind of color.

316
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:06,718
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can scroll down a little bit.

317
00:37:06,738 --> 00:37:06,898
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

318
00:37:07,018 --> 00:37:11,120
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is what you'll see on Fulbright Street.

319
00:37:11,941 --> 00:37:15,463
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, insulated metal panel systems for the new edition.

320
00:37:16,424 --> 00:37:21,367
[SPEAKER_01]: The front of the new edition will be, like I mentioned before, the silver ACM with the red highlight

321
00:37:23,035 --> 00:37:24,156
[SPEAKER_01]: as demanded by Toyota.

322
00:37:25,377 --> 00:37:27,938
[SPEAKER_01]: And beyond that, you'll see the existing bank building.

323
00:37:37,284 --> 00:37:41,046
[SPEAKER_01]: And so minus the trees, this is what you'll see from Mystic Avenue.

324
00:37:41,066 --> 00:37:43,408
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the main entrance to the building.

325
00:37:56,234 --> 00:37:58,296
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's it for me.

326
00:37:59,457 --> 00:38:02,799
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody else has any feedback or questions.

327
00:38:07,863 --> 00:38:14,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, madam chair that concludes our presentation and we're happy to answer any questions that the board or the public may have.

328
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:17,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you all for your presentation.

329
00:38:18,191 --> 00:38:20,212
[SPEAKER_03]: We truly appreciate it.

330
00:38:20,292 --> 00:38:28,978
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to, I know that there were some significant comments from Director Blake regarding traffic and he's not present with us this evening.

331
00:38:28,998 --> 00:38:34,341
[SPEAKER_03]: And you said that you had sat down with him as well as planner Daniel Evans.

332
00:38:35,101 --> 00:38:39,124
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just trying to figure out, I have not heard mention of an access permit.

333
00:38:39,424 --> 00:38:43,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it true that you need a mascot access permit and that can actually dictate or impact

334
00:38:44,547 --> 00:38:47,830
[SPEAKER_03]: the recommendations by the city for what you need to do on the site.

335
00:38:49,291 --> 00:38:52,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you explain a little bit about that process?

336
00:38:53,935 --> 00:38:57,197
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's correct, Madam Chair.

337
00:38:57,378 --> 00:38:59,139
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, Dave Newhall with Crocker Design Group.

338
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:09,788
[SPEAKER_08]: Mystic Ave is a mass DOT right-of-way, so we will need a access permit that we need to apply for from mass DOT.

339
00:39:11,086 --> 00:39:32,125
[SPEAKER_08]: That process, if we have obtained a positive approval from this board, in addition to the ZBA approval we have already, we take our approvals and our plans and we submit those along with our traffic study and our curb cut per their standards.

340
00:39:33,043 --> 00:39:54,268
[SPEAKER_08]: that gets submitted to MassDOT for an access permit, and they'll further review the access that we propose along Mystic Ave, so the radiuses of that curb cut, the width of the curb cut, the movements, as well as the sidewalk, the pedestrian sidewalk along the frontage.

341
00:39:54,647 --> 00:39:56,669
[SPEAKER_08]: that we're posing within their right of way.

342
00:39:57,509 --> 00:40:03,575
[SPEAKER_08]: So they will ultimately have the final say in what we can and can't do within their jurisdiction.

343
00:40:04,455 --> 00:40:15,425
[SPEAKER_08]: Additionally, Todd Blake had made some comments on pedestrian access across the Fulbright Street and then across Mystic Ave.

344
00:40:18,501 --> 00:40:39,177
[SPEAKER_08]: We won't be allowed to do any of those without their approval, those will be included so an added crosswalk across Fulbright Street, making sure our accessible route is there for ADA, as well as any indicators like the pedestrian flashers for crossing Mystic Ave, all of that will have to get permitted through.

345
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:40,771
[SPEAKER_08]: MassDOT.

346
00:40:40,791 --> 00:40:46,356
[SPEAKER_08]: So we received those comments from Todd Blake, we're working on incorporating them into our site plan set.

347
00:40:46,496 --> 00:40:55,064
[SPEAKER_08]: But ultimately, we receive approval from the board, we would then have to go to DOT and then go through their process in which they'll review their plans.

348
00:40:55,505 --> 00:41:05,514
[SPEAKER_08]: And if there's anything significant that changes during the DOT process, that materially affects the plans that are approved by this board, we would then come back

349
00:41:06,075 --> 00:41:13,281
[SPEAKER_08]: at that time to present the updated plans based off the feedback we received from DOT and their requirements.

350
00:41:17,964 --> 00:41:20,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. Navarre.

351
00:41:20,486 --> 00:41:24,269
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to open it up to the board for any further questions.

352
00:41:30,574 --> 00:41:31,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice Chair Feldman?

353
00:41:33,156 --> 00:41:34,177
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I always have a few.

354
00:41:36,367 --> 00:41:38,788
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you so much for this really thoughtful presentation.

355
00:41:40,269 --> 00:41:50,874
[SPEAKER_13]: I've said this about a few different applicants, but I feel like this is the type of presentation that, you know, Danielle and Alicia, when future applicants come to the board and say, what do we want?

356
00:41:51,955 --> 00:41:55,697
[SPEAKER_13]: This could be a really great model for HRO, very detailed.

357
00:41:55,717 --> 00:41:57,057
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you so much for that.

358
00:41:58,718 --> 00:41:59,999
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm a Herb Chambers customer.

359
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:08,722
[SPEAKER_13]: I bought my Honda up in Burlington, so I'm very familiar with the excellent service, you know, the quality of the business.

360
00:42:08,742 --> 00:42:13,765
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, just adding that little anecdote.

361
00:42:14,485 --> 00:42:15,625
[SPEAKER_13]: A couple questions.

362
00:42:16,986 --> 00:42:19,247
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you still planning to maintain your Alston location?

363
00:42:19,267 --> 00:42:23,689
[SPEAKER_13]: Because that's kind of like the Herb Chambers in Boston for Toyota.

364
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:27,991
[SPEAKER_07]: That location would be moving to this location.

365
00:42:28,652 --> 00:42:30,413
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, okay, that's helpful.

366
00:42:30,613 --> 00:42:34,415
[SPEAKER_13]: This feels like a much more accessible location, so that's nice.

367
00:42:35,355 --> 00:42:43,399
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know you already mentioned the landscaping islands and the parking lots, and it sounds like that's still a work in progress, so I don't want to spend too much time on it.

368
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:57,265
[SPEAKER_13]: I saw that some landscaping islands were removed or relocated, and I think what would be helpful when you come back to us would be to understand a comparison of the permeable

369
00:42:58,128 --> 00:43:17,993
[SPEAKER_13]: space as it was to what it is proposed to be, just to help us kind of understand that, you know, yes, maybe some islands are removed, but, you know, in summation, it's, you know, it's maintained, or ideally, you know, there's a decrease in impermeable space.

370
00:43:19,073 --> 00:43:24,775
[SPEAKER_13]: I would also love to hear about any sustainability initiatives, whether it's tonight or future sessions.

371
00:43:26,984 --> 00:43:30,406
[SPEAKER_13]: So permeable pavers, EV chargers.

372
00:43:30,466 --> 00:43:34,569
[SPEAKER_13]: I know Toyota has some electric options in their fleet.

373
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:44,556
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I would also be interested in you all looking into solar as part of the feasibility of your project.

374
00:43:46,217 --> 00:43:47,859
[SPEAKER_13]: Solar is very affordable.

375
00:43:48,259 --> 00:43:51,421
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a lot of tax credit programs out there right now.

376
00:43:53,732 --> 00:44:04,636
[SPEAKER_13]: There's actually a dealership, I just looked it up, I think in Texas, which does have a slightly different solar profile than we do, that has a ton of solar panels.

377
00:44:05,496 --> 00:44:18,860
[SPEAKER_13]: You can also look into solar canopies, which serve a dual purpose of renewable energy, plus they protect the cars from sun, snow, hail, bird excrement, whatever you want.

378
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,461
[SPEAKER_13]: So those are just my initial comments.

379
00:44:23,995 --> 00:44:24,315
[SPEAKER_13]: thoughts.

380
00:44:25,256 --> 00:44:25,617
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

381
00:44:25,637 --> 00:44:25,837
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

382
00:44:26,477 --> 00:44:29,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, vice chair, vice chair.

383
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:35,946
[SPEAKER_03]: When you, can I just, when you said EV charging stations, so the proponent does have EV charging stations on the site.

384
00:44:35,966 --> 00:44:37,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want more in addition to?

385
00:44:38,548 --> 00:44:40,049
[SPEAKER_03]: That was something that was proposed.

386
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:41,431
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry, I must have missed that.

387
00:44:41,871 --> 00:44:43,092
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for pointing that out to me.

388
00:44:43,573 --> 00:44:48,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so there are EV chargers, but I just wanted to, I didn't know if you wanted more in addition because they, they're,

389
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:55,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Director Blake has also mentioned that he would like to see more as the need arises.

390
00:44:56,144 --> 00:45:02,570
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I would trust Director Blake's expertise there in terms of the quantity and location of those.

391
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:05,352
[SPEAKER_13]: But yeah, thank you for pointing that out to me, Chair McPherson.

392
00:45:05,372 --> 00:45:05,913
[SPEAKER_13]: I appreciate it.

393
00:45:06,602 --> 00:45:07,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.

394
00:45:07,342 --> 00:45:10,444
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the things that, so speaking of that, I wanted to go back.

395
00:45:10,804 --> 00:45:15,046
[SPEAKER_03]: I had not, thank you, Vice Chair Edelman, for bringing up the also location.

396
00:45:15,066 --> 00:45:16,406
[SPEAKER_03]: So that brings more traffic here.

397
00:45:17,027 --> 00:45:26,291
[SPEAKER_03]: And Attorney Marinelli had originally said that the traffic report said there was going to be 656 fewer uses than the former bank.

398
00:45:27,051 --> 00:45:32,673
[SPEAKER_03]: So at this point, I'm just trying to figure out how that ties into the traffic.

399
00:45:34,381 --> 00:45:39,806
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess this is when we need our board member, Peter Cowles, and understanding the impact in that area.

400
00:45:41,087 --> 00:45:46,272
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to trust that you did your traffic report.

401
00:45:46,332 --> 00:45:55,241
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get into that, but I just, I want to have a little bit more confidence that it will not trigger any kind of more traffic congestion there.

402
00:45:57,830 --> 00:46:05,676
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, you know, you might find useful to take a look when you have a chance at page 25, which are the conclusions of the chapel engineering.

403
00:46:06,016 --> 00:46:11,780
[SPEAKER_05]: And they did a pretty thorough job on probably like eight or 10 bullet points.

404
00:46:13,041 --> 00:46:19,105
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the one that I thought was important was the trips per day and the amount that's fewer trips.

405
00:46:19,185 --> 00:46:25,009
[SPEAKER_05]: But it does in the bullet point above that, it does talk about, you know, the amount of cars

406
00:46:26,572 --> 00:46:35,361
[SPEAKER_05]: basically it says the increase is expected to amount to less than one trip per minute during the weekday a.m.

407
00:46:35,441 --> 00:46:39,726
[SPEAKER_05]: peak hours and slightly more than one trip per minute during the Saturday midday peak.

408
00:46:39,766 --> 00:46:45,832
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the bullet point below the one that I had referred to on page 25.

409
00:46:47,227 --> 00:46:59,212
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think, you know, before the next meeting, if there's any questions on that, maybe through Danielle, you could let us know and we'll get any clarification on anything that you want.

410
00:47:03,054 --> 00:47:05,395
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate that.

411
00:47:05,435 --> 00:47:10,717
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that there are sort of generic codes and it's kind of hard with the actual versus

412
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:16,921
[SPEAKER_03]: versus existing conditions and trying to forecast for that traffic.

413
00:47:16,961 --> 00:47:28,285
[SPEAKER_03]: So me being a planner myself, I don't usually, traffic studies, they're very helpful, but just knowing the area itself, I usually look for other indicators of confidence, but I appreciate that.

414
00:47:29,105 --> 00:47:31,646
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go with board member, Ari Fishman.

415
00:47:35,284 --> 00:47:41,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Chair McPherson, and thank you to the applicants for a very clear and detailed presentation.

416
00:47:41,527 --> 00:47:42,528
[SPEAKER_09]: Much appreciated.

417
00:47:42,548 --> 00:47:46,350
[SPEAKER_09]: I have two kind of separate questions.

418
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:48,691
[SPEAKER_09]: The first one is about the landscaping.

419
00:47:49,051 --> 00:47:55,035
[SPEAKER_09]: I recognized many of the species, but I just wanted to check in about what percentage of them are native.

420
00:47:55,075 --> 00:47:59,097
[SPEAKER_09]: I know a decent percent are, but we have really been trying to push.

421
00:47:59,798 --> 00:48:08,073
[SPEAKER_09]: As high a percentage of native as possible in new developments, especially such large ones and.

422
00:48:09,567 --> 00:48:12,328
[SPEAKER_09]: I can either ask my second question now or wait for a response.

423
00:48:13,828 --> 00:48:16,989
[SPEAKER_12]: I will respond to the first, so I don't distract you.

424
00:48:17,149 --> 00:48:22,891
[SPEAKER_12]: The majority of them are Native, and I would say close to 90% of them are Native.

425
00:48:22,971 --> 00:48:30,193
[SPEAKER_12]: There are a few that certain towns will say are Native, some aren't.

426
00:48:32,233 --> 00:48:34,134
[SPEAKER_12]: But we did aim for Native plants.

427
00:48:35,254 --> 00:48:35,894
[SPEAKER_09]: That's wonderful.

428
00:48:35,934 --> 00:48:37,055
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks so much for confirming.

429
00:48:37,075 --> 00:48:37,795
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought that's what it was.

430
00:48:39,977 --> 00:48:47,300
[SPEAKER_09]: And my second question is on mass transit or public transport access.

431
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:56,444
[SPEAKER_09]: I know there are a few bus lines that go down Mystic and as we're talking about pedestrian crosswalks, is it near any stops of that bus?

432
00:48:56,864 --> 00:49:03,947
[SPEAKER_09]: And is there any planning that's been developed around making sure that that is a pedestrian safe entrance?

433
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:09,515
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, sorry I must have skipped over that.

434
00:49:09,935 --> 00:49:18,179
[SPEAKER_08]: There is an existing bus stop enclosure that is located right at the corner of Fulbright and Mystic Ave here.

435
00:49:18,899 --> 00:49:25,682
[SPEAKER_08]: So we are proposing this concrete walkway across our frontage and then this will also extend down.

436
00:49:26,242 --> 00:49:31,325
[SPEAKER_08]: So on-site access, it'll be ADA compliant to this bus enclosure here.

437
00:49:33,586 --> 00:49:34,626
[SPEAKER_09]: Lovely, thank you so much.

438
00:49:34,646 --> 00:49:35,867
[SPEAKER_08]: You're welcome.

439
00:49:39,156 --> 00:49:39,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

440
00:49:40,557 --> 00:49:41,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, thank you so much.

441
00:49:43,118 --> 00:49:45,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, Director Blake has captured that.

442
00:49:45,699 --> 00:49:49,740
[SPEAKER_03]: That was one of my concerns, but it was something that was captured within.

443
00:49:49,760 --> 00:50:00,564
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I guess at this point, I'm going to ask the city for clarification if there's anything that you wanted to add before I open it up to public comment.

444
00:50:01,305 --> 00:50:01,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Danielle,

445
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:06,451
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

446
00:50:07,872 --> 00:50:28,285
[SPEAKER_14]: So when Director Blake and I also discussed this project, and in order to encourage employees and folks to come on public transit, so they can arrive at that bus stop that's on the north side of north, where's the north arrow?

447
00:50:29,266 --> 00:50:30,887
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, on the curb chamber side of the,

448
00:50:32,667 --> 00:50:39,789
[SPEAKER_14]: of Mystic app, but when they're crossing the street to take the return trip, there's actually no bus shelter there.

449
00:50:39,809 --> 00:50:46,972
[SPEAKER_14]: So one of the recommendations from director Blake was to perhaps provide one.

450
00:50:46,992 --> 00:50:59,936
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that might need to go through DOT approval, but that was a suggestion, I believe in the memo,

451
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:09,704
[SPEAKER_14]: So, yes, it was in charge, but also leaving was there.

452
00:51:11,065 --> 00:51:14,467
[SPEAKER_14]: Was there anything that was agreed upon and meeting with director Blake.

453
00:51:15,208 --> 00:51:20,651
[SPEAKER_14]: But other pedestrian safety.

454
00:51:21,352 --> 00:51:23,974
[SPEAKER_14]: Encouraging these, these mode shifts away from trips.

455
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,322
[SPEAKER_08]: So in our meeting with Ms.

456
00:51:29,542 --> 00:51:32,304
[SPEAKER_08]: Spike, nothing was formally agreed to.

457
00:51:32,384 --> 00:51:33,786
[SPEAKER_08]: We took his feedback.

458
00:51:33,806 --> 00:51:40,992
[SPEAKER_08]: Now we're just, we would need to get DOT to allow us to do that for us to actually agree to do it.

459
00:51:41,032 --> 00:51:51,841
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to be able to be allowed to through DOT to add the bus shelter and the pedestrian access across the street to improve those.

460
00:51:52,362 --> 00:51:52,522
[SPEAKER_08]: So,

461
00:51:54,685 --> 00:52:00,949
[SPEAKER_08]: With DOT approval, we would be able to do it, but we just wouldn't have that at this time to be able to agree to that.

462
00:52:04,331 --> 00:52:09,173
[SPEAKER_14]: And if I could add another aspect of MassDOT and their approval.

463
00:52:09,213 --> 00:52:16,137
[SPEAKER_14]: So we recently had another project further up the Stigav where they applied for their access permit and it wasn't

464
00:52:18,129 --> 00:52:19,950
[SPEAKER_14]: The full access was not granted.

465
00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:25,011
[SPEAKER_14]: There were turning movement limitations, so there was no left in, no left out.

466
00:52:25,151 --> 00:52:27,932
[SPEAKER_14]: So it was all right in, right out.

467
00:52:28,992 --> 00:52:40,035
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you have a backup plan if that is what they decide for this site as well, and how that might impact queuing of cars?

468
00:52:40,275 --> 00:52:46,797
[SPEAKER_14]: And that throws the whole study off of where cars will be going, where trips will

469
00:52:49,837 --> 00:52:55,641
[SPEAKER_14]: records will be going instead of, you know, uneven disbursement, they're all going to be shunted a different way.

470
00:52:58,663 --> 00:53:05,888
[SPEAKER_08]: We haven't formally studied the restricted access, but we would shift access for

471
00:53:08,179 --> 00:53:28,534
[SPEAKER_08]: employees or for customers really who would be impacted by this curb cut would be using the Mystic Ave curb cut to then take this left here onto Fulbright and use the first access point here to then come in and take a right and access the site to get the service into sales.

472
00:53:31,630 --> 00:53:46,509
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's something we will certainly look into and make sure that our traffic study has addresses that if that becomes the case during our DLT permitting process, you can have an idea of how that might may impact.

473
00:53:47,911 --> 00:53:49,533
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, through the chair, because if.

474
00:53:51,884 --> 00:54:02,106
[SPEAKER_14]: If the access permit isn't granted, you know, doesn't go the way that you, as a requesting, then it could cause changes to the site plan requiring you to come back.

475
00:54:02,606 --> 00:54:08,667
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm wondering if there needs to be a plan B for if you're not able to get the turning movements.

476
00:54:10,327 --> 00:54:19,489
[SPEAKER_03]: And if there's a plan B, it would help with the process going forward because the board can vote on an administrative process for the city to actually, for planning staff

477
00:54:20,223 --> 00:54:23,306
[SPEAKER_03]: to approve as opposed to you coming back before us.

478
00:54:23,386 --> 00:54:27,909
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's something to keep in mind if you do have a plan B. We've learned our lessons previously.

479
00:54:29,831 --> 00:54:30,472
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.

480
00:54:37,417 --> 00:54:37,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Director Hunt?

481
00:54:39,403 --> 00:54:40,263
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

482
00:54:40,363 --> 00:54:49,425
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually wanted to follow up on the bus, sorry, the bus access and the pedestrian access.

483
00:54:49,585 --> 00:54:51,086
[SPEAKER_10]: I wasn't quite following.

484
00:54:51,566 --> 00:54:59,628
[SPEAKER_10]: So it is very reasonable to me to expect that both employees and customers would take advantage of the bus route there, right?

485
00:54:59,668 --> 00:55:03,709
[SPEAKER_10]: Drop off your car, hop the bus to Boston, pick it up on your way home, et cetera.

486
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:17,441
[SPEAKER_10]: And I wasn't quite following how people what the safe pedestrian route was from the bus shelter to the front of the business, or to the back of the business if it was for employees or, or both.

487
00:55:17,481 --> 00:55:18,722
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to follow up on that.

488
00:55:18,822 --> 00:55:21,665
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I had a second completely unrelated question.

489
00:55:26,089 --> 00:55:27,550
[SPEAKER_08]: To answer that question.

490
00:55:28,822 --> 00:55:56,170
[SPEAKER_08]: for the employee access and what we had discussed yesterday with Director Blake was to continue this concrete sidewalk along our frontage and then align it with this concrete apron here so if we have employees that finishing up their shift here and they're leaving for the day they can walk have a safe passage it will require us and we're working on those updates for this

491
00:55:56,745 --> 00:56:12,610
[SPEAKER_08]: relocated curb cut on Fulbright so that they'll have access going straight down to Fulbright Street and then along Fulbright Street and then along this concrete walkway to the bus enclosure here.

492
00:56:13,390 --> 00:56:16,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Additionally, they could walk along the building as well.

493
00:56:19,211 --> 00:56:19,932
[SPEAKER_08]: Access for

494
00:56:22,198 --> 00:56:29,376
[SPEAKER_08]: for customers would likely come from this area here and across my

495
00:56:30,353 --> 00:56:32,855
[SPEAKER_08]: bring up a very good point of how they get there.

496
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:56,136
[SPEAKER_08]: Extending this walkway up our entrance will be something we will add to address that, whether it be across the curb cut here and up this way, and then provide some cross hatching and some painted marks to alert drivers that there will be pedestrian crossing here to then access the bus stop would be the best way to do that.

497
00:56:57,677 --> 00:56:58,138
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

498
00:56:58,298 --> 00:57:04,662
[SPEAKER_10]: And then actually, I realized just sort of the entrance that you're proposing there off of Route 20.

499
00:57:05,743 --> 00:57:06,143
[SPEAKER_10]: What are we 38?

500
00:57:06,243 --> 00:57:10,466
[SPEAKER_10]: That is actually the same location as the existing one.

501
00:57:10,546 --> 00:57:11,727
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that can you just confirm?

502
00:57:11,767 --> 00:57:12,488
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that correct?

503
00:57:13,108 --> 00:57:14,649
[SPEAKER_08]: It is not the same location.

504
00:57:14,789 --> 00:57:18,292
[SPEAKER_08]: The existing location is actually

505
00:57:20,847 --> 00:57:31,595
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is just approximate, but somewhere over here ish and just shifted a little further this way a little farther away from the off ramp.

506
00:57:32,336 --> 00:57:36,899
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so that does actually play in that the mass dot access permit is actually a.

507
00:57:38,318 --> 00:57:46,045
[SPEAKER_10]: In my mind, if it was the exact same location, it might not be so subject to their, you know, thoughts.

508
00:57:46,986 --> 00:57:50,230
[SPEAKER_10]: So, so that's helpful on the other.

509
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:50,910
[SPEAKER_10]: So, the.

510
00:57:52,171 --> 00:57:56,556
[SPEAKER_10]: As just a piece of advice, I think this has come up before, but I would recommend that you have.

511
00:57:57,933 --> 00:58:00,594
[SPEAKER_10]: significant bike parking for employees.

512
00:58:01,214 --> 00:58:05,296
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't, the area is not wonderfully bike accessible at this time.

513
00:58:05,476 --> 00:58:09,498
[SPEAKER_10]: We do have bicyclists who do bike down here to go into Boston.

514
00:58:10,118 --> 00:58:18,041
[SPEAKER_10]: Usually anybody going a long distance is actually going on the bike path that is behind you along the highway.

515
00:58:19,562 --> 00:58:21,843
[SPEAKER_10]: But I do, we are seeing more and more and

516
00:58:22,925 --> 00:58:24,886
[SPEAKER_10]: local people biking to work.

517
00:58:25,427 --> 00:58:31,770
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would encourage you to make sure you have some facilities so they feel that their bicycles are secure while they're working.

518
00:58:33,932 --> 00:58:35,773
[SPEAKER_10]: And then having a few for customers.

519
00:58:36,153 --> 00:58:43,197
[SPEAKER_10]: I know Director Blake spoke to that, but the employee ones I think are very realistic, will be well used.

520
00:58:43,978 --> 00:58:51,763
[SPEAKER_10]: If I had a smaller bike, maybe I would take it with me, drop the car off and then take my bike back to work.

521
00:58:52,863 --> 00:59:09,510
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, so I just want to mention that and then the solar, we have a solar ordinance that requires that new and major renovations, uh, study solar, uh, and then typically, uh, put solar on the roofs of their buildings.

522
00:59:09,930 --> 00:59:13,871
[SPEAKER_10]: As long as the solar studies say that they are, uh, make sense.

523
00:59:14,532 --> 00:59:18,113
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't imagine why it wouldn't make sense at this location.

524
00:59:18,473 --> 00:59:20,074
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just want to make sure you're aware of that.

525
00:59:21,459 --> 00:59:30,223
[SPEAKER_10]: And we encourage that as early as possible before building permits, but it's good if you want any waivers that they should come through with the site plan review.

526
00:59:31,164 --> 00:59:36,126
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, to get a waiver, you'd have to provide a study showing that it's not possible.

527
00:59:36,867 --> 00:59:38,568
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, so I encourage that.

528
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:44,721
[SPEAKER_08]: to respond to both of those points.

529
00:59:44,861 --> 00:59:52,384
[SPEAKER_08]: So part of our discussion with Director Blake was in this back area here for employees.

530
00:59:52,404 --> 00:59:59,146
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe he said in the range of enough for 12 bicycle spaces in his comments here.

531
00:59:59,166 --> 01:00:06,288
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, putting it along the backside of the building here since our employees will be in this area here.

532
01:00:08,415 --> 01:00:18,521
[SPEAKER_08]: Assuming that 12 is kind of a good number for that, we're acceptable to that and adding that to the next round of revisions to address that comment.

533
01:00:21,123 --> 01:00:31,829
[SPEAKER_10]: As far as- I would just add, if you have the ability to put it roofed and or caged, I would highly recommend that as somebody, we have a number of staff who bike to City Hall in the rain.

534
01:00:32,970 --> 01:00:36,792
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's nice when your bike is not soaking wet when you leave the building, so.

535
01:00:39,870 --> 01:00:51,500
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we can certainly look into if there may be a location inside the building as well in there if there's any, any room but and then to proof outside as well.

536
01:00:51,821 --> 01:00:53,542
[SPEAKER_08]: It will certainly look into that.

537
01:00:54,783 --> 01:01:02,030
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, I'm sorry what was your second point was solar sorry.

538
01:01:02,130 --> 01:01:02,350
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

539
01:01:03,111 --> 01:01:03,871
[SPEAKER_08]: So, we have.

540
01:01:06,218 --> 01:01:12,440
[SPEAKER_08]: contracted with a solar company to initiate that process, get a preliminary layout of solar.

541
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:21,983
[SPEAKER_08]: And now we're just in the back and forth process where they see a roof, and now we just have equipment for the building that goes on the roof.

542
01:01:22,023 --> 01:01:30,946
[SPEAKER_08]: So now just trying to do the jigsaw puzzle of getting solar on the roof to meet the requirements of that ordinance that you had mentioned.

543
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:33,082
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're in that process.

544
01:01:33,122 --> 01:01:38,067
[SPEAKER_08]: We do have a solar consultant that we are working with, um, to do our best to meet that.

545
01:01:50,925 --> 01:02:08,867
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, well, we spoke yesterday, or I think it was yesterday or the day before, and I brought up the same point that Vice Chair Hedeman did about exploring solar canopy carports, especially over the storage area in the middle.

546
01:02:10,962 --> 01:02:22,389
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you look into that or can you have your solar consultant look into that because I do think it would be a win win of protecting the cars and I didn't even think about for a good point.

547
01:02:22,889 --> 01:02:25,711
[SPEAKER_14]: And also that would.

548
01:02:28,107 --> 01:02:31,228
[SPEAKER_14]: you wouldn't have to put the landscape islands under there.

549
01:02:31,268 --> 01:02:38,671
[SPEAKER_14]: So it could be a wash of what, how many spaces you would lose for these, the supports.

550
01:02:40,711 --> 01:02:45,133
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not an expert, so hopefully you would have a sort of result looking at the feasibility of that.

551
01:02:45,733 --> 01:02:56,597
[SPEAKER_14]: So trying to get away from a large parking fields and how to better use them when they are present.

552
01:02:59,888 --> 01:03:16,211
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so like we had said, and to your point for our conversation that we had with you yesterday morning, we do have the solar consultant on board for the roof, and now we're engaging them to take a look at the solar canopies.

553
01:03:16,231 --> 01:03:25,673
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of the first step was running it through our client, through Herb Chambers, because that's something that they don't have at any of their other dealerships.

554
01:03:27,583 --> 01:03:33,306
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, it affects the visibility of cars and the businesses to sell vehicles.

555
01:03:33,846 --> 01:03:36,368
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's not something that they're accustomed to.

556
01:03:36,388 --> 01:03:39,529
[SPEAKER_08]: And they haven't done it before.

557
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:41,490
[SPEAKER_08]: So obviously, it's something new.

558
01:03:41,550 --> 01:03:43,932
[SPEAKER_08]: So we are in the process of gathering that information.

559
01:03:44,672 --> 01:03:55,738
[SPEAKER_08]: We've provided them with locations where we've seen this done, where they can go see it in person, as well as engaging the solar consultants to see if that's something that may be a fit here.

560
01:03:57,136 --> 01:04:05,601
[SPEAKER_08]: We do have a few different elements out in this inventory parking area that can become a challenge as you had mentioned with the supports.

561
01:04:06,141 --> 01:04:14,647
[SPEAKER_08]: We have the plastic chamber system here that is subsurface that is existing, and then also another one here.

562
01:04:15,407 --> 01:04:18,089
[SPEAKER_08]: So those do limit where maybe those supports

563
01:04:19,344 --> 01:04:27,691
[SPEAKER_08]: could go in this area, as well as some other drainage structures and subsurface pipes going through this area that aren't shown here.

564
01:04:29,253 --> 01:04:39,903
[SPEAKER_08]: So those are some of the limitations, but we do have a solar consultant on board, and we are exploring the possibility to see if that's something that might be a fit for this location.

565
01:04:54,922 --> 01:04:55,683
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.

566
01:04:55,703 --> 01:04:57,666
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no other questions.

567
01:04:57,786 --> 01:05:02,072
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to open it up for public comments since the public hearing this evening.

568
01:05:04,457 --> 01:05:08,940
[SPEAKER_03]: So those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message to Young McConnish.

569
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:13,063
[SPEAKER_03]: You can also send an email to OCD at welfare-ma.gov.

570
01:05:13,543 --> 01:05:16,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.

571
01:05:17,226 --> 01:05:23,490
[SPEAKER_03]: A reminder to all meeting participants to please refrain from using the chat function to provide comments as it is not part of the public record.

572
01:05:24,011 --> 01:05:30,275
[SPEAKER_03]: However, if the participants have an audio or other technical difficulties, this may be entered into the chat to let myself and staff

573
01:05:31,926 --> 01:05:37,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Danielle, can you manage the comment queue and read any previously sent emails or letters?

574
01:05:41,192 --> 01:05:44,595
[SPEAKER_14]: I see one raised hand, Ken Kraus.

575
01:05:46,196 --> 01:05:46,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Kraus?

576
01:05:48,517 --> 01:05:49,198
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, thank you.

577
01:05:49,218 --> 01:05:52,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you state your name and address?

578
01:05:53,433 --> 01:05:59,424
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly, it's a can Krause and I live at 50 mystic street in Medford.

579
01:06:01,046 --> 01:06:03,791
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in favor of this project as was stated by someone else.

580
01:06:03,871 --> 01:06:05,935
[SPEAKER_00]: I also purchased a car at.

581
01:06:07,529 --> 01:06:20,193
[SPEAKER_00]: Herb Chambers a couple years ago, a wonderful hybrid RAV4, have actually been taking my service needs to Woburn Toyota, honestly, for a number of reasons.

582
01:06:20,233 --> 01:06:28,176
[SPEAKER_00]: But this project looks very comparable to the Woburn setup, which is very high tech and very state of the art.

583
01:06:28,216 --> 01:06:29,477
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a feeling my

584
01:06:30,457 --> 01:06:36,222
[SPEAKER_00]: Service work might be coming back to Medford at some point, but two comments I want to make.

585
01:06:36,342 --> 01:06:46,570
[SPEAKER_00]: One, specifically, I wanted to use this opportunity to register a comment about the historical context of the site of the three-story building that's going to be removed.

586
01:06:47,510 --> 01:06:49,892
[SPEAKER_00]: The proponent may or may not know, but this

587
01:06:51,073 --> 01:06:58,158
[SPEAKER_00]: site was for about 50 years the home of the Ballaroo roller skating rank.

588
01:06:58,238 --> 01:07:11,187
[SPEAKER_00]: It was truly a Medford institution that attracted skaters from not just Medford but throughout the region for for social skating and for competitions and it really was a landmark from about the 1930s to the

589
01:07:14,008 --> 01:07:16,829
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the building has been approved for demolition.

590
01:07:16,869 --> 01:07:25,590
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not suggesting that it not be replaced, but I think there is some bones of the, if not the original building, certainly an older version of it.

591
01:07:26,091 --> 01:07:37,493
[SPEAKER_00]: Attorney Marinelli mentioned at the Board of Appeals meeting that there were some wood piles still existing, and part of the reason why they needed to tear it down was those were just not conducive to remain for what they want to build.

592
01:07:38,653 --> 01:08:03,455
[SPEAKER_00]: What I would like to ask of the proponent, though, is that as they prepare the plans for furnishing the interior, that they give consideration to acknowledging the previous use of this site for five decades and perhaps in the seating area, display some photos or maybe on the video board of what this site previously was.

593
01:08:03,495 --> 01:08:05,516
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there are a lot of uses dating back

594
01:08:06,337 --> 01:08:18,980
[SPEAKER_00]: centuries that we could think about acknowledging appropriately as well, but I think it would be appropriate to acknowledge this 20th century use if possible.

595
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:32,843
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Mr. Chambers has an affinity for local history, particularly his own Dorchester neighborhood, so I'm hoping that the proponent would be open to acknowledging the local history of this site as they furnish the

596
01:08:34,143 --> 01:08:35,764
[SPEAKER_00]: the inside of the facility.

597
01:08:36,845 --> 01:08:47,672
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondly, looking at the proposal, I'm confident that Todd Blake has done a good job in assessing the accessibility needs.

598
01:08:48,052 --> 01:08:55,196
[SPEAKER_00]: It jumped out at me like in the image that's shown there that the bus stop was gone and there's no sidewalk in front of the building.

599
01:08:55,517 --> 01:08:59,179
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad to hear that a lot of that has been already addressed and will be

600
01:08:59,999 --> 01:09:01,941
[SPEAKER_00]: added to the plan.

601
01:09:02,001 --> 01:09:08,188
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in a perfect world, we'd want to continue a sidewalk up and down Mystic Avenue.

602
01:09:08,568 --> 01:09:13,473
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of mixed-use development envisioned for this corridor.

603
01:09:13,513 --> 01:09:17,357
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to look a lot different than it does currently in the next few years.

604
01:09:19,199 --> 01:09:20,740
[SPEAKER_00]: Continuing the sidewalk

605
01:09:21,661 --> 01:09:36,873
[SPEAKER_00]: past the site towards Somerville, maybe unrealistic, especially with the I-93 ramp there, but I'm happy to see that the crossing is going to be improved because a lot of people will be walking to this point and then probably crossing the street to continue their journey.

606
01:09:37,774 --> 01:09:42,998
[SPEAKER_00]: One little tweak that I'd like you to consider with the sidewalk, if you look at the property

607
01:09:43,738 --> 01:09:44,458
[SPEAKER_00]: next door.

608
01:09:44,478 --> 01:09:46,259
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a Volkswagen dealership.

609
01:09:46,359 --> 01:09:50,321
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a sidewalk there that is very beautifully designed.

610
01:09:50,341 --> 01:10:00,265
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a concrete sidewalk with about a eight foot or so, maybe even wider grass median between the sidewalk and the street.

611
01:10:01,365 --> 01:10:12,570
[SPEAKER_00]: The landscape plan that I saw here, I'm glad to see the sidewalk has been added to the bus stop, but it looks like it's right up against the curb and

612
01:10:13,550 --> 01:10:16,891
[SPEAKER_00]: That is less safe for one thing.

613
01:10:17,351 --> 01:10:28,274
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also hazardous when snow plows come by and push the snow up onto the sidewalk and people splash as they drive by in their cars.

614
01:10:28,354 --> 01:10:30,655
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if possible, it would be

615
01:10:32,498 --> 01:10:46,566
[SPEAKER_00]: a more attractive and a more safe design if there was some way to move it back from directly against the curb so there was a bit of a buffer there as there is at the sidewalk in front of the adjacent property.

616
01:10:46,606 --> 01:10:52,090
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that the driveway is right up against the back of the bus stop in that landscape area but

617
01:10:52,611 --> 01:11:05,710
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could possibly look at that and see if there's a way to move that sidewalk from directly up against the curb, so there'd be a little bit of a buffer that would be appreciated and the last comment would be also.

618
01:11:07,692 --> 01:11:13,256
[SPEAKER_00]: if Herb Chambers would commit to keeping that sidewalk clear in the winter.

619
01:11:13,376 --> 01:11:20,421
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes these little stretches of sidewalk sort of become orphaned and they aren't always maintained.

620
01:11:20,481 --> 01:11:32,069
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the plans for keeping the whole complex free of snow, I'd hope that sidewalk that's gonna be along Mystic Avenue would be included in the snow maintenance plan.

621
01:11:32,129 --> 01:11:33,790
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are my comments, I thank you.

622
01:11:34,317 --> 01:11:35,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. Cross.

623
01:11:35,838 --> 01:11:40,861
[SPEAKER_03]: And we didn't have any other, so I appreciate your comments.

624
01:11:40,941 --> 01:11:47,184
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't want to cut you off at the two minute mark because we don't have any other comments coming in.

625
01:11:48,185 --> 01:11:58,051
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to allow the proponent to decide if they want to respond now or just keep in mind what Mr. Cross has mentioned.

626
01:12:02,079 --> 01:12:05,762
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we can respond on the sidewalk.

627
01:12:06,062 --> 01:12:16,912
[SPEAKER_08]: Our consideration was obviously the bus stop that's there today and there's a sidewalk there as well to reconstruct that and in a similar location and extend it further.

628
01:12:18,513 --> 01:12:25,559
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll certainly take a look to see if there's a way to possibly provide a landscape buffer, as you mentioned, similar to next door.

629
01:12:26,782 --> 01:12:50,175
[SPEAKER_08]: um the reasoning for not continuing down down mystic is because the off-ramp there there's really nowhere to go from there so um as as as todd blake had mentioned and improving this access for pedestrians going across the street and visibility is kind of more of our focus that we think would be more worthwhile than better used um as far as the

630
01:12:52,143 --> 01:13:08,292
[SPEAKER_08]: Committing to any snow removal or to the plaque I'd have to defer to to john on this call if he wants to comment on that now or or or just Think it through on their end and we can respond to that at a later time So with that if john wants to comment, I'll turn it over to him.

631
01:13:08,552 --> 01:13:10,553
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely something for you to take with you.

632
01:13:10,753 --> 01:13:20,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, don't um at this point, it's it's it's you're not um If you can just take uh, mr. Cross's comments into consideration and and just

633
01:13:21,952 --> 01:13:23,693
[SPEAKER_03]: respond accordingly going forward.

634
01:13:24,034 --> 01:13:24,834
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.

635
01:13:25,335 --> 01:13:26,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thank you so much.

636
01:13:26,535 --> 01:13:27,396
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate it.

637
01:13:27,536 --> 01:13:30,278
[SPEAKER_03]: And Mr. Cross, we appreciate your input.

638
01:13:31,519 --> 01:13:41,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Danielle, do you have any other comments to read into from the queue or from emails?

639
01:13:41,026 --> 01:13:43,568
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't see any other raised hands.

640
01:13:43,768 --> 01:13:50,133
[SPEAKER_14]: I will check our general mailbox, see if anything has come in since I last checked.

641
01:14:03,986 --> 01:14:06,467
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't see any comments that have come in.

642
01:14:09,837 --> 01:14:13,678
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to close the public comment period for this meeting.

643
01:14:14,539 --> 01:14:23,022
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to ask for clarification if the board has any clarifying comments or questions going forward.

644
01:14:23,202 --> 01:14:26,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to remind the board that we will not be voting this evening.

645
01:14:26,563 --> 01:14:36,387
[SPEAKER_03]: The proponent will be coming back before us with revised site plans as per recommendations of Todd Blake and other department heads, including the PDS staff.

646
01:14:37,027 --> 01:14:38,508
[SPEAKER_03]: But if there's any last

647
01:14:38,885 --> 01:14:46,931
[SPEAKER_03]: other additional recommendations you want to give before we continue their hearing to a date certain which would be June 26.

648
01:15:04,008 --> 01:15:17,672
[SPEAKER_03]: hearing none, and actually before I ask for a motion, I just wanted to just circle back really quick to Mr. Cross and let you know that I definitely, I didn't want to put the performant on the spot right now.

649
01:15:17,712 --> 01:15:22,414
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted him to take your recommendations into full consideration to be able to offer

650
01:15:25,147 --> 01:15:26,508
[SPEAKER_03]: an appropriate response for you.

651
01:15:26,568 --> 01:15:28,348
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why I didn't.

652
01:15:29,469 --> 01:15:33,050
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to move it for them to think about it going forward with us.

653
01:15:33,970 --> 01:15:44,514
[SPEAKER_03]: So coming back to June 26, if I can have a motion to continue the hearing for 400 Mystic Avenue to June 26.

654
01:15:45,975 --> 01:15:46,795
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll make the motion.

655
01:15:47,996 --> 01:15:49,116
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Vice Chair Henneman.

656
01:15:49,316 --> 01:15:50,737
[SPEAKER_03]: And do I have a second motion?

657
01:15:54,078 --> 01:15:54,518
[SPEAKER_09]: I second.

658
01:15:56,500 --> 01:16:00,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so that's, so roll call, Vice Chair Edelman?

[SPEAKER_03]: And myself, Jackie McPherson, I'm an aye.

[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much, Attorney Ron Valley, Mr. Walsh, and all that have presented this evening.

666
01:16:17,015 --> 01:16:18,857
[SPEAKER_03]: We will see you on June 26th.

667
01:16:19,577 --> 01:16:25,401
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much, Madam Chair and members of the board, and for your time and attention, and for all of the comments, appreciate it.

668
01:16:25,782 --> 01:16:26,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

669
01:16:26,722 --> 01:16:27,122
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

670
01:16:27,142 --> 01:16:28,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

671
01:16:28,083 --> 01:16:29,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good evening.

672
01:16:29,445 --> 01:16:30,966
[SPEAKER_04]: You as well.

673
01:16:38,132 --> 01:16:49,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Danielle has our I just want to make sure before I know we're going to do the next item, but just for the A&R is has the performance showed up for 79 Jeremiah circle?

674
01:16:49,343 --> 01:16:50,344
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I see him now.

675
01:16:50,384 --> 01:16:51,525
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm Sam Ibrahim.

676
01:16:52,912 --> 01:17:01,197
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so I am going to invite the board to present for 79 Jeremiah, just to remind the board that this is an approval not required.

677
01:17:01,297 --> 01:17:09,301
[SPEAKER_03]: We are specifically looking to make sure that it meets the frontage right requirements and adequate access.

678
01:17:09,921 --> 01:17:12,503
[SPEAKER_03]: So at that point, if I can, Ms.

679
01:17:12,563 --> 01:17:14,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Ibrahim, if you can go ahead.

680
01:17:18,706 --> 01:17:20,147
[SPEAKER_03]: You're on mute.

681
01:17:20,167 --> 01:17:20,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

682
01:17:22,053 --> 01:17:22,914
[SPEAKER_14]: Asked to unmute him.

683
01:17:25,156 --> 01:17:25,596
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

684
01:17:26,437 --> 01:17:27,978
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to share my screen.

685
01:17:27,998 --> 01:17:29,539
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

686
01:17:31,420 --> 01:17:32,081
[SPEAKER_14]: Show the planes.

687
01:17:39,126 --> 01:17:40,127
[SPEAKER_14]: Can everybody see those?

688
01:17:40,147 --> 01:17:43,329
[SPEAKER_06]: I can, yes.

689
01:17:44,050 --> 01:17:44,270
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

690
01:17:46,306 --> 01:17:58,557
[SPEAKER_06]: So this right here is my house at 9 Jeremiah Circle and this is my next-door neighbor of 40 plus years.

691
01:18:00,539 --> 01:18:05,223
[SPEAKER_06]: So a few years ago we built a pool back here.

692
01:18:06,385 --> 01:18:26,063
[SPEAKER_06]: and the distance from here to the to my fence uh is a bit narrow so I had asked him if uh if I could get a small narrow piece of land from him and and he actually without hesitation he says you can have anything you want so

693
01:18:26,895 --> 01:18:31,939
[SPEAKER_06]: So I hired Medford Engineering.

694
01:18:31,959 --> 01:18:38,464
[SPEAKER_06]: I know they've done work with the city of Medford with all this stuff.

695
01:18:38,985 --> 01:18:43,688
[SPEAKER_06]: So they came in and planned all of this.

696
01:18:44,069 --> 01:18:53,196
[SPEAKER_06]: And they maintained this as my next door neighbor's lot remains.

697
01:18:55,698 --> 01:18:57,039
[SPEAKER_06]: meeting all the approvals.

698
01:18:57,539 --> 01:19:01,142
[SPEAKER_06]: The frontage is unaffected because this is the front of the street right here.

699
01:19:01,863 --> 01:19:19,075
[SPEAKER_06]: And as you see, the four foot wide parcel of land by 62 feet long starts in the middle of the lot, passing by the corner of his house.

700
01:19:21,397 --> 01:19:32,424
[SPEAKER_06]: After the rear right corner of his house expires, then that small forefoot section starts.

701
01:19:33,124 --> 01:19:38,027
[SPEAKER_06]: So none of his house and the setbacks or anything is affected by it.

702
01:19:39,648 --> 01:19:45,932
[SPEAKER_06]: And the size of his lot remains above 7,000 square feet, which is the minimum required.

703
01:19:47,777 --> 01:19:52,439
[SPEAKER_06]: which is why I learned the word ANR.

704
01:19:53,179 --> 01:20:01,661
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess that's really the only thing I'm asking for and that's pretty much it.

705
01:20:01,681 --> 01:20:08,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. Ibrahim.

706
01:20:10,357 --> 01:20:14,740
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to make sure that so this doesn't change the frontage at all does.

707
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:15,861
[SPEAKER_06]: No, the frontage.

708
01:20:16,081 --> 01:20:18,162
[SPEAKER_06]: This is Jeremiah circle right here.

709
01:20:18,603 --> 01:20:18,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

710
01:20:19,503 --> 01:20:25,527
[SPEAKER_06]: So and right over here is South Water Road, and he is number seven and then follow that as number nine.

711
01:20:25,547 --> 01:20:32,092
[SPEAKER_06]: So the frontage of his was as a 65 feet remained.

712
01:20:32,672 --> 01:20:36,375
[SPEAKER_06]: And mine was 65 feet and it also remained no changes there.

713
01:20:36,955 --> 01:20:39,477
[SPEAKER_06]: The only change, the only change happened

714
01:20:40,257 --> 01:21:07,785
[SPEAKER_06]: is when you come in from Jeremiah's circle in between his house and mine if you walk on the grass once you pass by his house several feet later is when it starts so the rear the rear lot line will change by four feet the front does not change

715
01:21:09,355 --> 01:21:13,858
[SPEAKER_03]: The real lot line, so that does not affect access.

716
01:21:14,238 --> 01:21:15,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Can the city help me with this one?

717
01:21:16,079 --> 01:21:18,500
[SPEAKER_03]: It does not sound like it's affecting access at all.

718
01:21:18,681 --> 01:21:20,822
[SPEAKER_06]: No, DCR is behind us.

719
01:21:21,442 --> 01:21:21,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

720
01:21:22,002 --> 01:21:25,444
[SPEAKER_06]: There's about one square mile of woods behind our houses.

721
01:21:25,845 --> 01:21:36,891
[SPEAKER_06]: As you see in the bottom left, you see number 61 there, because his lot is rectangular, 65 in the front, 65 in the back.

722
01:21:37,852 --> 01:21:38,532
[SPEAKER_06]: If you deduct

723
01:21:39,025 --> 01:21:44,611
[SPEAKER_06]: four feet out of that 65 year down to 61, which is what he now would have after this.

724
01:21:50,177 --> 01:21:51,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thank you so much.

725
01:21:51,098 --> 01:21:51,158
[SPEAKER_03]: So,

726
01:21:57,311 --> 01:22:03,874
[SPEAKER_03]: To clarify for the board, basically, again, we're looking at the front on the right-of-way.

727
01:22:04,354 --> 01:22:08,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it satisfy the minimum frontage requirements, which is 35 feet at least?

728
01:22:09,056 --> 01:22:11,877
[SPEAKER_03]: And is there vital access to the lights provided?

729
01:22:12,137 --> 01:22:19,540
[SPEAKER_03]: And based on Mr. Ibrahim's presentation, I would ask for a motion to endorse the plan as an A&R.

730
01:22:20,921 --> 01:22:23,462
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see any other reason not to.

731
01:22:23,482 --> 01:22:26,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

732
01:22:32,181 --> 01:22:37,146
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't need approval, but it needs an endorsement for not needing approval.

733
01:22:40,249 --> 01:22:43,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Vice Chair Herman.

734
01:22:44,273 --> 01:22:44,593
[SPEAKER_13]: Two things.

735
01:22:44,653 --> 01:22:48,938
[SPEAKER_13]: I was going to ask if we could put the visuals back up, but this is great too, Danielle.

736
01:22:49,438 --> 01:22:53,202
[SPEAKER_13]: And then my other question was just, besides like a procedural thing,

737
01:22:55,005 --> 01:22:56,866
[SPEAKER_13]: Why are we doing this?

738
01:22:57,627 --> 01:22:59,468
[SPEAKER_13]: The city of Medford, oh, sorry.

739
01:22:59,488 --> 01:23:00,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead, I'm sorry.

740
01:23:00,309 --> 01:23:03,151
[SPEAKER_13]: It was more like, yeah, sorry.

741
01:23:03,291 --> 01:23:05,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Originally, when we put the swimming pool in.

742
01:23:05,893 --> 01:23:08,374
[SPEAKER_13]: So you're the pool owner.

743
01:23:08,835 --> 01:23:09,175
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.

744
01:23:09,926 --> 01:23:10,926
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, yes.

745
01:23:11,507 --> 01:23:20,370
[SPEAKER_06]: So when we put the swimming pool in, we put the fence in and there's about a six to seven foot area there.

746
01:23:20,951 --> 01:23:23,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, this is more of a convenience thing.

747
01:23:23,552 --> 01:23:25,452
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like a life and death thing.

748
01:23:25,973 --> 01:23:33,456
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's, it's, there's just not quite enough room to get around the other side of the pool if you put a lounge chair in there.

749
01:23:34,056 --> 01:23:37,898
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, I didn't really do a full study on where the sun and all of that happened.

750
01:23:37,938 --> 01:23:38,878
[SPEAKER_06]: So with my mistake,

751
01:23:39,505 --> 01:23:46,675
[SPEAKER_06]: So we find ourselves sitting on that side, you know, abutting his fence, or on my fence really, abutting his lot.

752
01:23:49,929 --> 01:24:02,717
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, we thought if we had a little bit more breathing room in there, uh, to, uh, to have, uh, a little bit more like, you know, just so we can get around the pool.

753
01:24:03,758 --> 01:24:09,521
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, you know, uh, now I've got a couple of grandchildren that are freshly born.

754
01:24:09,601 --> 01:24:15,145
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just, you know, for safety for that part of it, just so when they get around or they're running around and stuff like that.

755
01:24:16,125 --> 01:24:19,047
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, there's enough room there for them to walk around.

756
01:24:19,147 --> 01:24:25,352
[SPEAKER_06]: So I asked him if I could purchase so that he said, you don't need to purchase it, you can you can have whatever you want.

757
01:24:25,733 --> 01:24:29,816
[SPEAKER_06]: So, so, so that's kind of where we came up to.

758
01:24:30,877 --> 01:24:43,807
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I, you know, called Chuck Viniciano from Medford Engineering, who is the person I've dealt with in the past when we did the addition or the pool and any of that stuff.

759
01:24:44,637 --> 01:25:03,521
[SPEAKER_06]: uh you know he did the work on it then he said you know he he gave me those three letters this is a and r but uh so whatever that meant but so he said you know you gotta go down go through the process and get their stamp yeah that's all fine so yeah the the applicant that signed the form aa is that your neighbor

760
01:25:05,252 --> 01:25:06,694
[SPEAKER_06]: No, he hasn't signed anything.

761
01:25:06,734 --> 01:25:20,825
[SPEAKER_06]: The only thing that Okay, from what I understand is going to be signed by him is once once we get your approval, then I give it to the attorney, my attorney, he's gonna redo the deed.

762
01:25:21,085 --> 01:25:27,371
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's when my next door neighbor will sign whatever paperwork needs to be signed.

763
01:25:27,431 --> 01:25:31,294
[SPEAKER_06]: So my attorney can go and re register the deed with the new

764
01:25:32,183 --> 01:25:41,408
[SPEAKER_13]: With this, I'm just confused, though, because it says applicants certify that they are the owners of the subject property, and the subject properties are seven and nine.

765
01:25:42,049 --> 01:25:49,013
[SPEAKER_13]: We have you in front of us, we have potentially your signature, I just want to make sure we're not doing this, like, I totally believe you.

766
01:25:49,093 --> 01:25:56,898
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm honestly, very happy that you and your, your neighbor have such a wonderful relationship that, you know, you've been able to work this out.

767
01:25:57,018 --> 01:25:57,478
[SPEAKER_13]: But I just

768
01:25:58,392 --> 01:26:00,453
[SPEAKER_13]: um, you know, verify.

769
01:26:00,473 --> 01:26:15,699
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm happy to get I believe when we did that, when I went to do the paperwork, I maybe by we, we thought we were only needed one application to fill it.

770
01:26:15,779 --> 01:26:21,102
[SPEAKER_13]: So I don't know how it's for two different properties, seven and nine Jeremiah circle.

771
01:26:21,602 --> 01:26:26,704
[SPEAKER_13]: And it looks like both applicant fields have been highlighted at some point yet only one is signed.

772
01:26:27,658 --> 01:26:30,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so do you need me to I don't know.

773
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:31,140
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

774
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:49,532
[SPEAKER_13]: I just like I don't want to give our approval with one party Well, I mean you're you're like present and I guess that uh, mr. Abraham This is the last question for you and maybe more question for the city because if we don't need both and great Yeah, but if we do then I'll leave that up to daniela.

775
01:26:49,572 --> 01:26:51,053
[SPEAKER_13]: We just want to be intentional about it.

776
01:26:51,393 --> 01:26:51,713
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you

777
01:26:53,606 --> 01:26:58,450
[SPEAKER_14]: Madam Chair, I do have the plan that's signed by your neighbor.

778
01:26:58,470 --> 01:27:00,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this is what I'm looking at.

779
01:27:01,373 --> 01:27:09,139
[SPEAKER_14]: I am seeing more, this one I have, and that's the one that I put into the... Yeah, this is, it's part of the materials, the meeting materials.

780
01:27:09,199 --> 01:27:12,462
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want, that's what I'm trying to double check as Lily was asking.

781
01:27:12,902 --> 01:27:14,103
[SPEAKER_13]: Is more the neighbor?

782
01:27:14,123 --> 01:27:14,183
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

783
01:27:14,604 --> 01:27:15,224
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

784
01:27:15,605 --> 01:27:15,965
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

785
01:27:16,125 --> 01:27:17,366
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, good.

786
01:27:17,386 --> 01:27:19,088
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that's the one I was asking about.

787
01:27:20,028 --> 01:27:22,609
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I think there was, I think there was just some confusion.

788
01:27:22,749 --> 01:27:23,529
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

789
01:27:24,410 --> 01:27:25,410
Yeah.

790
01:27:25,870 --> 01:27:26,690
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

791
01:27:26,730 --> 01:27:27,751
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no issues.

792
01:27:27,791 --> 01:27:28,391
[SPEAKER_13]: No questions.

793
01:27:28,711 --> 01:27:31,412
[SPEAKER_13]: Congratulations on having a great neighbor neighbor relationship.

794
01:27:31,512 --> 01:27:36,714
[SPEAKER_06]: It can be very rare these days.

795
01:27:36,754 --> 01:27:39,575
[SPEAKER_06]: You can have this is good neighbors and I got one on each side.

796
01:27:40,095 --> 01:27:40,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Very nice.

797
01:27:41,275 --> 01:27:43,436
[SPEAKER_13]: I might say something nice about you to Mr. Abraham.

798
01:27:43,596 --> 01:27:48,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you know, you have to be good to people around you if you want them to be good to you.

799
01:27:48,418 --> 01:27:48,658
[SPEAKER_06]: You know,

800
01:27:50,096 --> 01:27:51,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much for your time.

801
01:27:51,599 --> 01:27:55,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Danielle, I'll email you tomorrow to see what the next process is.

802
01:27:57,238 --> 01:27:58,438
[SPEAKER_03]: One second, Mr. Abraham.

803
01:27:58,698 --> 01:28:05,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Abraham, before you leave, we just wanted to make sure we got Vice Chair Hederman's, we still haven't voted as a board.

804
01:28:05,660 --> 01:28:06,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I apologize.

805
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:07,260
[SPEAKER_03]: This is all.

806
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:07,960
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's okay.

807
01:28:08,420 --> 01:28:09,521
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's totally okay.

808
01:28:09,721 --> 01:28:21,143
[SPEAKER_03]: She had a great, Vice Chair Hederman brought up a great question, and I knew that I had seen something on the site plan, but it's, I think it was just the way that the information was presented, and so now we're all back.

809
01:28:21,903 --> 01:28:27,905
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can ask for a motion to endorse the ANR 47 and 9 Jeremiah circle.

810
01:28:28,465 --> 01:28:29,185
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll make the motion.

811
01:28:30,326 --> 01:28:31,326
[SPEAKER_03]: And can I have a second?

812
01:28:32,646 --> 01:28:33,547
[SPEAKER_09]: I can second.

813
01:28:34,067 --> 01:28:36,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Sally can have it.

814
01:28:37,768 --> 01:28:40,068
[SPEAKER_03]: And so roll call vice chair Hederman.

815
01:28:40,729 --> 01:28:42,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

816
01:28:43,529 --> 01:28:44,470
[SPEAKER_03]: In Arby Fishman.

817
01:28:45,310 --> 01:28:45,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

818
01:28:46,210 --> 01:28:46,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Sally Akiki.

819
01:28:46,950 --> 01:28:48,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

820
01:28:49,425 --> 01:28:50,852
[SPEAKER_03]: and myself, Jackie McPherson.

821
01:28:51,616 --> 01:28:52,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.

822
01:28:54,278 --> 01:28:54,658
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

823
01:28:54,698 --> 01:28:55,899
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much for your time.

824
01:28:55,939 --> 01:28:56,660
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate it.

825
01:28:56,720 --> 01:28:57,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

826
01:28:57,140 --> 01:28:58,361
[SPEAKER_13]: Have fun by the pool this summer.

827
01:28:58,381 --> 01:28:59,222
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

828
01:28:59,282 --> 01:28:59,862
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks a lot.

829
01:28:59,942 --> 01:29:02,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Danielle, I'll reach out by email to you later.

830
01:29:02,504 --> 01:29:02,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

831
01:29:03,144 --> 01:29:03,625
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

832
01:29:03,645 --> 01:29:04,726
[SPEAKER_10]: Have a good night.

833
01:29:04,886 --> 01:29:14,333
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam Chair, just before you move on, I will just remind the board that you have the document on file that I can sign an A&R on behalf of all the members.

834
01:29:15,453 --> 01:29:17,695
[SPEAKER_10]: So nobody has to come in and sign this.

835
01:29:17,815 --> 01:29:21,558
[SPEAKER_10]: I can just sign the document for him probably tomorrow.

836
01:29:22,710 --> 01:29:23,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds good.

837
01:29:23,251 --> 01:29:25,874
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll reach out to Danielle whenever it's ready.

838
01:29:25,934 --> 01:29:29,118
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll come and get it and take it to the attorney to move forward with it.

839
01:29:29,899 --> 01:29:30,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

840
01:29:30,260 --> 01:29:30,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks again.

841
01:29:30,820 --> 01:29:31,521
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate it.

842
01:29:31,982 --> 01:29:32,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

843
01:29:32,382 --> 01:29:33,404
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a great evening.

844
01:29:33,744 --> 01:29:34,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

845
01:29:34,845 --> 01:29:35,066
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.

846
01:29:37,874 --> 01:29:41,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so the next item on our agenda for this evening is zoning amendments.

847
01:29:41,736 --> 01:29:49,239
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe there was a city council paper number 24-033 where they refer it to us for this evening.

848
01:29:49,779 --> 01:29:51,480
[SPEAKER_03]: And I will read the public hearing notice.

849
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:56,462
[SPEAKER_03]: The Medford Community Development Board shall conduct a public hearing on June 5th, 2024 at 6.30 PM via Zoom.

850
01:29:59,267 --> 01:30:04,352
[SPEAKER_03]: remote video conferencing relative to the following proposed amendments to the City of Medford zoning ordinance.

851
01:30:05,092 --> 01:30:15,342
[SPEAKER_03]: One, amending the format of the table of use and parking regulations to replace the parking and loading code columns with specific parking and loading requirements.

852
01:30:15,782 --> 01:30:22,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Amending section 94-12, which is definitions, to add new defined terms and revise existing definitions.

853
01:30:23,649 --> 01:30:27,231
[SPEAKER_03]: Number three, adopt a new GIS-based digital zoning map.

854
01:30:27,491 --> 01:30:42,238
[SPEAKER_03]: Adoption of the new map format is not intended to result in any material changes to the zoning of any parcels within the city, but is intended to confirm the best information available to the city regarding the existing zoning destination for all properties in the city.

855
01:30:43,038 --> 01:30:44,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Number four, amending sections 94.1-4, 94.6.3-3,

856
01:30:52,170 --> 01:31:04,638
[SPEAKER_03]: section 2, 9411.7.2, section 4, and 94-12, to exempt municipal uses from certain use parking and dimensional requirements.

857
01:31:05,919 --> 01:31:11,382
[SPEAKER_03]: A link to the public hearing is posted on the city's website at medford.ma.org.

858
01:31:13,924 --> 01:31:19,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so I'm going to request at this point for Alicia or Danielle to please give us a

859
01:31:21,458 --> 01:31:25,800
[SPEAKER_03]: to introduce the consultant and to give us a brief update or introductory comments.

860
01:31:29,502 --> 01:31:30,682
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you want me to do that, Danielle?

861
01:31:32,763 --> 01:31:32,883
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

862
01:31:33,825 --> 01:31:40,612
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening, Madam Chair, as you all know the zoning process when there's a zoning change occurring.

863
01:31:41,092 --> 01:31:50,461
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think Emily may touch on some of this, but, uh, the zoning changes proposed to the city council, they must refer it to this board for your opinions and

864
01:31:51,502 --> 01:31:52,643
[SPEAKER_10]: and review.

865
01:31:53,304 --> 01:31:57,208
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you send that back to the city council and then they can vote it for approval.

866
01:31:57,768 --> 01:32:06,878
[SPEAKER_10]: For background, this is actually coming from as a joint project between our office and the city council that we hired

867
01:32:07,839 --> 01:32:13,263
[SPEAKER_10]: Emily Ennis several months ago to work with us on a rezoning update.

868
01:32:13,644 --> 01:32:22,972
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is the very first stage in that with some smaller things to set the stage for a larger zoning revamp.

869
01:32:23,372 --> 01:32:32,137
[SPEAKER_10]: It is the intention of the city to be looking more broadly about dimensions and uses and map lines, et cetera.

870
01:32:32,638 --> 01:32:40,782
[SPEAKER_10]: In order to do that, we are doing a couple of more minor changes to help set the way for that.

871
01:32:40,923 --> 01:32:45,225
[SPEAKER_10]: And so Emily's here this evening to present what we currently have in the works.

872
01:32:51,169 --> 01:32:51,289
[SPEAKER_03]: And.

873
01:32:52,618 --> 01:32:53,961
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening, Madam Chair.

874
01:32:53,981 --> 01:32:56,205
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening, members of the CBB.

875
01:32:56,265 --> 01:32:57,668
[SPEAKER_11]: Very nice to see you all.

876
01:32:59,131 --> 01:33:01,716
[SPEAKER_11]: I need to be able to share my screen if that's possible.

877
01:33:03,372 --> 01:33:04,033
[SPEAKER_11]: Aha, beautiful.

878
01:33:04,193 --> 01:33:06,395
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much for whoever turned that on.

879
01:33:07,636 --> 01:33:10,338
[SPEAKER_11]: So my name is Emily Ennis from Innes Associates.

880
01:33:11,138 --> 01:33:16,503
[SPEAKER_11]: As Alicia said, we have been starting to work with you all on this project.

881
01:33:17,083 --> 01:33:22,728
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to just run through a couple of initial things just to set the stage for where we are now.

882
01:33:23,348 --> 01:33:28,191
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we can go through the individual pieces at your pleasure.

883
01:33:28,211 --> 01:33:31,793
[SPEAKER_11]: We can stop and chat, or I can go through the whole piece.

884
01:33:31,933 --> 01:33:37,417
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think you've already mentioned the agenda, so that's just what we have here.

885
01:33:38,097 --> 01:33:40,919
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the project team that is working on this project.

886
01:33:40,939 --> 01:33:45,542
[SPEAKER_11]: So myself, Paula Ramos-Martinez, who's a senior urban designer and planner,

887
01:33:46,302 --> 01:33:51,525
[SPEAKER_11]: Jimmy Rocha, who's not only our spatial analyst and data scientist, but is actually a resident of Medford.

888
01:33:51,645 --> 01:33:55,547
[SPEAKER_11]: So he's been great for on-the-ground information.

889
01:33:56,047 --> 01:34:07,653
[SPEAKER_11]: And then Jonathan Silverstein from Blattman, Bobrowsky, Haverty, and Silverstein is providing a legal review of the code changes, the ordinance changes, as we move through the process.

890
01:34:08,093 --> 01:34:10,535
[SPEAKER_11]: So you will see all of these faces at some point.

891
01:34:13,540 --> 01:34:25,850
[SPEAKER_11]: Working on a actually it's a year and a bit project we started in March, and to update several sections of the zoning ordinance and they fall into two

892
01:34:26,389 --> 01:34:28,090
[SPEAKER_11]: four major buckets.

893
01:34:28,710 --> 01:34:31,652
[SPEAKER_11]: One is missing elements from the recodification.

894
01:34:31,752 --> 01:34:44,880
[SPEAKER_11]: So when the city did the recodification earlier, it was really to, it was more of a formatting change and a filling in some of the missing pieces change, but it was happening about the same time as a comprehensive plan.

895
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:52,805
[SPEAKER_11]: So there was some things in the recodification that were known, the city knew that they wanted to make some changes, but

896
01:34:53,205 --> 01:34:56,366
[SPEAKER_11]: because of the scope of a recodification, they didn't happen then.

897
01:34:56,606 --> 01:35:02,448
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's some administrative pieces, there's some definitions, there's some other technical pieces like that.

898
01:35:03,048 --> 01:35:05,029
[SPEAKER_11]: Then I mentioned the comprehensive plan.

899
01:35:05,529 --> 01:35:09,470
[SPEAKER_11]: We're also looking at the second bucket, which is past planning efforts.

900
01:35:09,530 --> 01:35:10,691
[SPEAKER_11]: So the comprehensive plan

901
01:35:11,171 --> 01:35:16,714
[SPEAKER_11]: the climate action plan, the area planning studies, all of those have had zoning recommendations.

902
01:35:17,155 --> 01:35:19,076
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're looking at those piece by piece.

903
01:35:19,796 --> 01:35:22,938
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the mayor and city councilors have made suggestions.

904
01:35:22,998 --> 01:35:29,842
[SPEAKER_11]: You also are welcome to make suggestions from your experience working with the zoning on a regular basis.

905
01:35:30,282 --> 01:35:37,606
[SPEAKER_11]: And we have a memo where we're tracking suggestions that come in and figuring out which bucket those need to go into.

906
01:35:37,707 --> 01:35:40,148
[SPEAKER_11]: And so some of those have been accessory dwelling units,

907
01:35:40,575 --> 01:35:43,858
[SPEAKER_11]: transportation demand management, inclusionary zoning.

908
01:35:43,898 --> 01:35:45,539
[SPEAKER_11]: There have been some other pieces in there.

909
01:35:45,999 --> 01:35:54,766
[SPEAKER_11]: We've also talked with your building commissioner and he's made some suggestions, some of which are coming forward in the definitions and some of which we're adding at a later date.

910
01:35:55,147 --> 01:35:58,429
[SPEAKER_11]: And then just general best practices as we walk through the zoning.

911
01:35:58,549 --> 01:36:04,514
[SPEAKER_11]: Are there pieces that we have seen other communities address that should be addressed in this process?

912
01:36:06,849 --> 01:36:09,690
[SPEAKER_11]: So Alicia mentioned that this is the first round that's coming through.

913
01:36:09,710 --> 01:36:12,011
[SPEAKER_11]: We're calling this the small plates round.

914
01:36:12,191 --> 01:36:15,712
[SPEAKER_11]: It's whetting the appetite for the bigger changes that are coming up.

915
01:36:16,432 --> 01:36:32,237
[SPEAKER_11]: We're also looking as we evaluate the small plates and sort of start this process in these bite-sized pieces, we're also looking at whether or not there are citywide policies where a zoning change is affecting the

916
01:36:32,857 --> 01:36:33,838
[SPEAKER_11]: entire city.

917
01:36:34,378 --> 01:36:39,282
[SPEAKER_11]: What does that mean, for example, some of the climate action plan may affect the entire city.

918
01:36:39,802 --> 01:36:53,573
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we're looking at area studies so are there zoning changes that might affect very specific areas and there have been a couple that have come up in the past part of this process we're going to revisit Mystic Avenue is one of those.

919
01:36:54,113 --> 01:37:06,797
[SPEAKER_11]: Medford Square is one that's been mentioned, the city's doing other work in other parts of the city and so we want to incorporate those as other planning processes happen.

920
01:37:07,398 --> 01:37:14,020
[SPEAKER_11]: So the idea is that we do the small plates by the end of this month, maybe take a little bit into July on those.

921
01:37:14,500 --> 01:37:21,623
[SPEAKER_11]: Then we're going to be starting to look at the citywide elements and then start to focus on the area studies.

922
01:37:22,544 --> 01:37:28,226
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're close to the end of the phase one small bites meeting with you tonight.

923
01:37:28,733 --> 01:37:33,676
[SPEAKER_11]: and then the next two meetings of the Planning and Permitting Committee.

924
01:37:34,877 --> 01:37:38,720
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to continue discussing the next steps.

925
01:37:39,380 --> 01:37:46,745
[SPEAKER_11]: Those steps are prioritizing the zoning recommendations from the Climate Adaptation Action Plan and from the Comprehensive Plan.

926
01:37:47,806 --> 01:37:56,111
[SPEAKER_11]: We are doing a lot of mapping analyses, so citywide analyses, and that includes thinking about

927
01:37:57,872 --> 01:37:59,473
[SPEAKER_11]: Non conformities among others.

928
01:38:00,674 --> 01:38:07,318
[SPEAKER_11]: So, watch when we look at the current zoning, which areas, which parcels are non conforming at several different levels.

929
01:38:07,718 --> 01:38:16,483
[SPEAKER_11]: We are also prepping our prioritization of the neighborhoods, quarters and squares by mapping transit recreation.

930
01:38:17,724 --> 01:38:22,867
[SPEAKER_11]: open space, all the things that you'd like to know before you start the neighborhood studies.

931
01:38:23,568 --> 01:38:32,755
[SPEAKER_11]: And then that will lead into our next step of working with city staff and then the planning permitting committee to get to those neighborhoods, quarters, and squares.

932
01:38:32,835 --> 01:38:38,039
[SPEAKER_11]: An early one may be Mystic Avenue, just because we've had so much work that has been done on that.

933
01:38:38,399 --> 01:38:40,700
[SPEAKER_11]: We want to revisit that and see if that's an option.

934
01:38:40,720 --> 01:38:43,722
[SPEAKER_11]: But there are certainly others that we see as priorities.

935
01:38:44,303 --> 01:38:53,388
[SPEAKER_11]: And the terminology for neighborhoods, corridors, and squares comes directly out of the work of the comprehensive plan that was identified then.

936
01:38:53,849 --> 01:39:01,233
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's the broad view of what we're doing over the next year and a half to finish by June 2026.

937
01:39:03,094 --> 01:39:03,735
[SPEAKER_11]: For tonight.

938
01:39:04,855 --> 01:39:08,978
[SPEAKER_11]: You had already Madam Chair mentioned the buckets that we're looking at tonight.

939
01:39:09,459 --> 01:39:20,166
[SPEAKER_11]: The first is the table of uses so your current table of land uses includes your parking regulations, and they're all a letter code.

940
01:39:20,926 --> 01:39:26,010
[SPEAKER_11]: So somebody has to who's who's interested in doing something has to go to the table of uses.

941
01:39:26,470 --> 01:39:33,555
[SPEAKER_11]: look at the letter code A, B, or C, and then go to the table of parking regulations and figure out what that code meant.

942
01:39:34,316 --> 01:39:41,281
[SPEAKER_11]: And the thought was that it would be a lot easier if the parking regulations could be just right next to the use, so you can see it there.

943
01:39:41,961 --> 01:39:52,003
[SPEAKER_11]: keeping people from having to go to multiple places, maybe making a mistake and thinking that they were a B and actually they're a D and they just go forward on that.

944
01:39:52,063 --> 01:39:53,544
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's just easier to do that.

945
01:39:54,084 --> 01:39:59,085
[SPEAKER_11]: So I believe you have in your packet the entire table and I can certainly pull it up as well.

946
01:39:59,145 --> 01:40:02,886
[SPEAKER_11]: But what you see here is just the first page of that.

947
01:40:02,986 --> 01:40:03,686
[SPEAKER_11]: And that is all.

948
01:40:03,706 --> 01:40:04,666
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not changing.

949
01:40:04,726 --> 01:40:08,887
[SPEAKER_11]: It's important to know that we are not changing the parking regulations at all.

950
01:40:09,207 --> 01:40:17,010
[SPEAKER_11]: We're just replacing the existing code with the number of spaces required for that particular use.

951
01:40:18,482 --> 01:40:22,085
[SPEAKER_11]: The next thing that we're talking about tonight is definitions.

952
01:40:22,105 --> 01:40:24,206
[SPEAKER_11]: And we have two sections of those.

953
01:40:24,726 --> 01:40:27,588
[SPEAKER_11]: One of which you see here is the terms to be modified.

954
01:40:28,048 --> 01:40:30,890
[SPEAKER_11]: The other is new definitions that we'd like to add.

955
01:40:31,330 --> 01:40:33,892
[SPEAKER_11]: I do have a slide for each of the definitions.

956
01:40:33,992 --> 01:40:37,814
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm going to hold off showing those until we get into that discussion.

957
01:40:38,835 --> 01:40:41,076
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I'm gonna make you briefly very dizzy.

958
01:40:41,977 --> 01:40:46,640
[SPEAKER_11]: The final thing to talk about tonight, at least from our perspective,

959
01:40:47,240 --> 01:40:49,742
[SPEAKER_11]: is a municipal site plan review language.

960
01:40:49,842 --> 01:41:11,017
[SPEAKER_11]: We are recommending that the city modify this language to allow for city projects to come through the municipal site plan review, not to be subject to the dimensional standards, but to create a point at which the public can have a voice in the overall process.

961
01:41:11,597 --> 01:41:13,999
[SPEAKER_11]: That is primarily what that language is about.

962
01:41:14,807 --> 01:41:21,111
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, as you mentioned, Madam Chair, you're also looking at adopting the new digital zoning map.

963
01:41:21,311 --> 01:41:32,279
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm going to stop there and just check in with you to see if you would prefer to take these one at a time, especially in terms of the definitions.

964
01:41:32,319 --> 01:41:44,207
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to read out each definition, but unless you would prefer that, but I can certainly put them up on the screen as we go through each definition.

965
01:41:44,607 --> 01:41:52,514
[SPEAKER_11]: I also have the memoranda that you have in your pocket that I can put up if you need to see the whole thing as part of the screen.

966
01:41:53,435 --> 01:41:58,199
[SPEAKER_11]: Alicia or Danielle, I don't know if you want to add anything at this point before we start discussion.

967
01:41:58,219 --> 01:42:01,482
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, great.

968
01:42:01,522 --> 01:42:08,729
[SPEAKER_11]: In that case, Madam Chair, I would recommend maybe we start with the table of uses and go from there.

969
01:42:09,369 --> 01:42:10,651
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, please proceed.

970
01:42:10,691 --> 01:42:11,051
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

971
01:42:13,363 --> 01:42:17,665
[SPEAKER_11]: If I switch over, do you see a memorandum format at this point?

972
01:42:17,685 --> 01:42:17,785
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

973
01:42:18,125 --> 01:42:18,466
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, good.

974
01:42:18,486 --> 01:42:21,227
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to make sure I'd share the screen instead of the document.

975
01:42:22,507 --> 01:42:25,068
[SPEAKER_11]: You should have this memorandum from us.

976
01:42:25,308 --> 01:42:33,352
[SPEAKER_11]: It gives the entire table of use and parking regulations just to orient anybody who may be at home who's seeing this for the first time.

977
01:42:34,172 --> 01:42:38,454
[SPEAKER_11]: What we are changing is in this bright yellow-orange on my screen.

978
01:42:39,034 --> 01:42:51,978
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, these were all just letter codes and now we are just simply changing them to the number of spaces either per dwelling unit or per guest room or whatever the requirement is for use.

979
01:42:52,459 --> 01:42:56,280
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, we're not changing the actual parking requirements themselves.

980
01:43:08,427 --> 01:43:13,930
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think for the table of uses, that's really the only part of the presentation.

981
01:43:14,611 --> 01:43:19,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

982
01:43:19,394 --> 01:43:25,798
[SPEAKER_03]: I think at this point, it's preferable if you just go through everything, and I guess we can ask questions at the end.

983
01:43:26,598 --> 01:43:26,878
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

984
01:43:27,018 --> 01:43:29,380
[SPEAKER_11]: Then I will go on to the definitions.

985
01:43:29,980 --> 01:43:34,383
[SPEAKER_11]: So in terms of the ones to be modified, we have accessories.

986
01:43:34,423 --> 01:43:36,144
[SPEAKER_11]: So there has been a question about

987
01:43:36,557 --> 01:43:38,940
[SPEAKER_11]: Accessory use versus accessory structure.

988
01:43:39,041 --> 01:43:41,444
[SPEAKER_11]: So we've changed that and I'll show you the one by one.

989
01:43:42,005 --> 01:43:45,610
[SPEAKER_11]: We're changing some of the definitions about different types of dwellings.

990
01:43:46,471 --> 01:43:53,341
[SPEAKER_11]: The definition for mobile home and you'll see when we get to it that we are adding additional definitions for manufactured home.

991
01:43:53,781 --> 01:43:57,062
[SPEAKER_11]: and tiny home, and the definition of the yard.

992
01:43:57,702 --> 01:44:02,543
[SPEAKER_11]: So you have a definition of accessory structure.

993
01:44:02,963 --> 01:44:06,324
[SPEAKER_11]: We're adding a definition of accessory use.

994
01:44:06,364 --> 01:44:07,664
[SPEAKER_11]: It was just accessories.

995
01:44:07,744 --> 01:44:16,766
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're going to, the changes here throughout this, if it's bolded and underlined, it means we're adding text.

996
01:44:17,266 --> 01:44:22,707
[SPEAKER_11]: If it's strikethrough, it means we're deleting text and the terms to be modified.

997
01:44:23,267 --> 01:44:35,055
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're recommending that you change your definition of accessory to accessory use, a use customarily, incidental to, and on the same lot or group of lots as a conforming principle use.

998
01:44:36,589 --> 01:44:49,842
[SPEAKER_11]: For dwelling multiple, we're going to, we're recommending that you change the dwelling, this definition to be consistent with section 3A of the Zoning Act.

999
01:44:50,222 --> 01:44:58,229
[SPEAKER_11]: And so the bold text and underlined below is that definition with the addition

1000
01:44:59,210 --> 01:45:02,331
[SPEAKER_11]: of defining some building types as well.

1001
01:45:02,591 --> 01:45:07,632
[SPEAKER_11]: So just because we're anticipating seeing those in other parts of the zoning.

1002
01:45:08,332 --> 01:45:17,573
[SPEAKER_11]: You do have a division between class A and class B multifamily, although we're going to recommend at some point that that division be removed.

1003
01:45:17,673 --> 01:45:23,534
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not ready to do that yet because there's some other types of work that we need to do before we can do that.

1004
01:45:23,574 --> 01:45:27,375
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to look at the districts themselves and the standards in the districts.

1005
01:45:27,975 --> 01:45:34,157
[SPEAKER_11]: So for now, we're recommending that you keep the class A, class B division, but we anticipate coming back to you for that.

1006
01:45:35,477 --> 01:45:46,039
[SPEAKER_11]: The other thing that we're recommending is removing the word family, single family and two family out and refer to units instead.

1007
01:45:47,900 --> 01:45:56,242
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a change that we're seeing in a number of communities rather than defining a family as somebody who's occupying a space.

1008
01:45:56,902 --> 01:45:58,444
[SPEAKER_11]: a household or a unit.

1009
01:45:58,504 --> 01:46:00,265
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're talking about single units.

1010
01:46:01,085 --> 01:46:04,648
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, you're seeing some references to some building types.

1011
01:46:04,808 --> 01:46:15,556
[SPEAKER_11]: So you can have a single-family attached dwelling, which is also known as a row house, a two-family detached, also known as a duplex.

1012
01:46:15,596 --> 01:46:21,941
[SPEAKER_11]: We're trying to clarify some terms that we've seen elsewhere to make it easier for people to understand what we mean.

1013
01:46:24,373 --> 01:46:26,254
[SPEAKER_11]: The next one, dwelling unit itself.

1014
01:46:26,394 --> 01:46:33,138
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're removing the word family from the definition of a dwelling unit and referring to the word household instead.

1015
01:46:34,159 --> 01:46:43,664
[SPEAKER_11]: You can also see that we are removing mobile home as a definition and replacing it with manufactured home, which is much more of the current standard.

1016
01:46:44,965 --> 01:46:47,087
[SPEAKER_11]: And as I said, you'll see when we

1017
01:46:48,107 --> 01:46:52,534
[SPEAKER_11]: add the add the definitions later on that we have some other definitions around this.

1018
01:46:52,974 --> 01:47:01,447
[SPEAKER_11]: And this was getting I believe this is one of the ones that the building commissioner requested us to do because there was some confusion between mobile homes manufactured homes.

1019
01:47:03,509 --> 01:47:06,691
[SPEAKER_11]: Tiny homes, so this helps to clarify those.

1020
01:47:07,571 --> 01:47:15,415
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the other thing that we've seen is a misunderstanding between yards and setbacks.

1021
01:47:15,516 --> 01:47:19,378
[SPEAKER_11]: So setback is a dimension and yard is an area.

1022
01:47:19,878 --> 01:47:29,203
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're recommending that the current definitions of yard be removed and that they be replaced with these definitions which make it clear.

1023
01:47:30,103 --> 01:47:33,047
[SPEAKER_11]: that a yard is an area.

1024
01:47:33,888 --> 01:47:42,077
[SPEAKER_11]: And we've added, in addition to just the definition of a yard, also the definition of front side and rear yards, the different types of yards.

1025
01:47:43,435 --> 01:47:48,858
[SPEAKER_11]: So those are all the terms to be modified the terms to be defined as new terms.

1026
01:47:48,878 --> 01:47:53,480
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of these are coming from the building commissioner.

1027
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:55,682
[SPEAKER_11]: Some are coming from other areas.

1028
01:47:55,822 --> 01:48:02,005
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're adding doggie daycare as a use so that it is distinct from a kennel.

1029
01:48:02,985 --> 01:48:06,087
[SPEAKER_11]: That was a request from the building commissioner.

1030
01:48:06,728 --> 01:48:11,170
[SPEAKER_11]: We're adding factory built home, which is not the same as a manufactured home.

1031
01:48:11,230 --> 01:48:18,835
[SPEAKER_11]: So a manufactured home, the definition is that we showed you earlier is really about a building that is built completely.

1032
01:48:19,716 --> 01:48:24,400
[SPEAKER_11]: Transferred to the site and then basically installed on the site a factory built home.

1033
01:48:24,460 --> 01:48:34,431
[SPEAKER_11]: You may have seen some of these where the panels are built within the factory, but when they're assembled on site, and you can't tell the difference between that.

1034
01:48:35,191 --> 01:48:38,492
[SPEAKER_11]: or a building that's been, say, stick built on the site.

1035
01:48:38,892 --> 01:48:55,074
[SPEAKER_11]: It is a new way of manufacturing housing to reduce the waste, but it's different from an entire unit that was built on site and then is transferred in one or more pieces, but essentially built to the site.

1036
01:48:55,094 --> 01:48:56,355
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're trying to define that.

1037
01:48:56,935 --> 01:49:03,876
[SPEAKER_11]: Defining institutional use, we're anticipating that we will have some additional administrative changes at some point.

1038
01:49:04,236 --> 01:49:05,597
[SPEAKER_11]: that will need that definition.

1039
01:49:05,617 --> 01:49:06,638
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're putting it in now.

1040
01:49:07,779 --> 01:49:15,585
[SPEAKER_11]: We're defining junkyards to go beyond just automotive junkyards and adding in some additional

1041
01:49:17,878 --> 01:49:19,679
[SPEAKER_11]: criteria around a junkyard.

1042
01:49:20,900 --> 01:49:27,945
[SPEAKER_11]: Redefining mixed use again, and this mixed use is the section 3A of the Zoning Act definition.

1043
01:49:28,805 --> 01:49:30,927
[SPEAKER_11]: Defining the class three motor vehicle use.

1044
01:49:30,967 --> 01:49:37,991
[SPEAKER_11]: This was another request from building commissioner and defining neighborhood cafe as distinct from a restaurant.

1045
01:49:38,412 --> 01:49:43,936
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, we're anticipating some changes to the districts at some point that we're going to need this definition.

1046
01:49:44,756 --> 01:49:51,980
[SPEAKER_11]: Tiny home movable and stationary really goes to the manufactured versus factory build homes that we talked about earlier.

1047
01:49:52,761 --> 01:50:02,367
[SPEAKER_11]: And here's where we talk about the yard setback to increase the differentiation between setback, the dimension, and yard, the area.

1048
01:50:03,656 --> 01:50:25,654
[SPEAKER_11]: And then finally, the municipal site plan review, I mentioned earlier, these are the sections that need to be changed in order to allow for city projects to come before the city board for review for the public comment, but still exempts it from the dimensional standards, which is consistent with many communities.

1049
01:50:27,316 --> 01:50:31,219
[SPEAKER_11]: And that is it, Madam Chair.

1050
01:50:40,443 --> 01:50:41,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone unmute me.

1051
01:50:41,303 --> 01:50:43,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.

1052
01:50:43,324 --> 01:50:44,885
[SPEAKER_03]: We appreciate your presentation.

1053
01:50:45,845 --> 01:50:53,948
[SPEAKER_03]: At this time, I'm going to defer to the city and see if you want to add anything before I open it up to the board for clarifying the questions.

1054
01:51:00,519 --> 01:51:03,620
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam Chair, this is wonderful.

1055
01:51:04,020 --> 01:51:06,201
[SPEAKER_10]: We've been working with Emily for quite a while on it.

1056
01:51:06,841 --> 01:51:13,684
[SPEAKER_10]: I had one question, which maybe even is a legal question, but the lawyer's not here tonight, so I'd rather just be comprehensive.

1057
01:51:14,864 --> 01:51:23,267
[SPEAKER_10]: I noticed in the table of uses, one of the things, and I did want to call your attention to, was that when we added in these

1058
01:51:24,707 --> 01:51:27,689
[SPEAKER_10]: the parking codes directly so you're not going back and forth.

1059
01:51:28,549 --> 01:51:34,391
[SPEAKER_10]: We do have some reductions, and so they're in there with a footnote.

1060
01:51:35,091 --> 01:51:44,775
[SPEAKER_10]: In my mind, the footnote should be in the parking column so that somebody who's looking for a parking information will see that there's a footnote on that.

1061
01:51:45,235 --> 01:52:02,543
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's where we reduce the amount of parking for affordable units and for transit oriented units, and whether the location of the footnote is something that the board needs to recommend versus just that's an administrative could be changed.

1062
01:52:04,064 --> 01:52:08,045
[SPEAKER_10]: And whether there's any reason why it shouldn't be where I think it should be.

1063
01:52:09,946 --> 01:52:10,687
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not always right.

1064
01:52:15,387 --> 01:52:16,696
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just looking at your footnotes.

1065
01:52:17,949 --> 01:52:21,932
[SPEAKER_11]: Madam Chair, I think I can respond if that's possible.

1066
01:52:22,292 --> 01:52:32,580
[SPEAKER_11]: I think if the CD board members voted tonight and then requested as part of the vote to put the footnote numbers, I think it was a typographical error.

1067
01:52:32,640 --> 01:52:35,462
[SPEAKER_11]: I see we've got one of the footnote numbers, but not the others.

1068
01:52:36,142 --> 01:52:45,429
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you made as part of your vote a recommendation to add those, I think just from a typographical issue, that would make sense.

1069
01:52:46,406 --> 01:53:14,197
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, I see them, so it's clear they're on under A residential lines, two, the second, three, four, and five have a little footnote number of four under the residential use name column, but on the PC loading code, at the very top PC footnote five is on the PC, but those fours should be in the yellow column.

1070
01:53:14,917 --> 01:53:16,118
[SPEAKER_10]: Agreed, yeah.

1071
01:53:39,917 --> 01:53:42,518
[SPEAKER_10]: And Madam Chair, that's it, that's all I have.

1072
01:53:44,019 --> 01:53:47,841
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have, I just wanted to know in the definitions, Ms.

1073
01:53:48,901 --> 01:54:00,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Stenz, you had said that the factory built versus manufactured, the only difference was that one was built in a factory and put on site, and then one was actually built on site.

1074
01:54:01,066 --> 01:54:04,448
[SPEAKER_03]: I could have that backwards, or did I get that wrong?

1075
01:54:06,309 --> 01:54:08,149
[SPEAKER_11]: It's slightly more complex than that.

1076
01:54:08,190 --> 01:54:08,890
[SPEAKER_11]: They're both,

1077
01:54:11,844 --> 01:54:16,467
[SPEAKER_11]: The pieces of the structure are both built in a factory.

1078
01:54:17,948 --> 01:54:24,072
[SPEAKER_11]: The difference is the manufactured home, I'm just going back to the definition so I don't mess it up.

1079
01:54:25,393 --> 01:54:29,136
[SPEAKER_11]: So the manufactured home, the entire structure is assembled.

1080
01:54:29,256 --> 01:54:35,340
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not just the components are built, the entire structure is actually assembled off site and it may be

1081
01:54:35,880 --> 01:54:41,005
[SPEAKER_11]: split into two, but it is still transported as that full structure.

1082
01:54:41,445 --> 01:54:45,749
[SPEAKER_11]: Whereas the factory built, all the panels, all the components are assembled on site.

1083
01:54:45,769 --> 01:54:58,081
[SPEAKER_11]: So the walls, the pieces of the walls are all created on site, built on site, but then they're transferred and those pieces completely assembled on site.

1084
01:54:58,201 --> 01:54:59,883
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you were to look at, say,

1085
01:55:00,523 --> 01:55:11,852
[SPEAKER_11]: A single-family house that a contractor stick-built versus a single-family house that the panels and other components were built off-site and they were assembled on-site, you wouldn't be able to tell the difference.

1086
01:55:13,093 --> 01:55:17,597
[SPEAKER_11]: They both look the same from the exterior, whereas a manufactured home does not.

1087
01:55:18,706 --> 01:55:19,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1088
01:55:19,926 --> 01:55:27,168
[SPEAKER_03]: In the manufactured homes, as far as like utilities and things like that, that usually doesn't have a basement because it's manufactured offsite, correct?

1089
01:55:27,328 --> 01:55:29,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Utilities go replaced with a basement.

1090
01:55:29,848 --> 01:55:31,809
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just trying to follow with the definitions.

1091
01:55:31,829 --> 01:55:32,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1092
01:55:32,989 --> 01:55:33,309
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1093
01:55:34,529 --> 01:55:36,610
[SPEAKER_11]: Just to clarify that, you're absolutely right.

1094
01:55:36,650 --> 01:55:41,471
[SPEAKER_11]: You put it on a pad and you hook the utilities up to it when you get it to the site.

1095
01:55:41,491 --> 01:55:41,571
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1096
01:55:48,912 --> 01:55:50,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Does the board have any other questions?

1097
01:55:54,075 --> 01:56:02,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a comment, a compliment, basically, coming from the construction field, I do really appreciate these updates and modernization.

1098
01:56:02,681 --> 01:56:05,403
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes it much easier when we're using the code.

1099
01:56:06,484 --> 01:56:06,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1100
01:56:10,146 --> 01:56:15,630
[SPEAKER_03]: And for myself, too, having followed this with Danielle and Director Hunt, I just

1101
01:56:17,006 --> 01:56:22,895
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to appreciate all the work that's gone into it and I wanted to encourage the board to take Ms.

1102
01:56:22,995 --> 01:56:27,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Enns up on the recommendations as Director Hunt has been asking us.

1103
01:56:27,461 --> 01:56:31,167
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that I wanted to dive into the site plan changes.

1104
01:56:32,629 --> 01:56:37,434
[SPEAKER_03]: try to get some feedback on things where, why do we do things a certain way?

1105
01:56:37,474 --> 01:56:41,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Can some things be done administratively through the PDS and so forth?

1106
01:56:41,178 --> 01:56:52,131
[SPEAKER_03]: I just have not found enough time in a day to get that, but I encourage us all to sort of think about how we can be more helpful in that process going forward.

1107
01:56:53,054 --> 01:56:55,516
[SPEAKER_03]: And with that, I don't have any other questions myself.

1108
01:56:55,596 --> 01:56:58,739
[SPEAKER_03]: I do know that I have to open this up to public comment.

1109
01:56:58,980 --> 01:57:12,713
[SPEAKER_03]: And before I do that, I wanted to see if the city has any other questions or comments at this point.

1110
01:57:15,670 --> 01:57:18,152
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, I am going to open up for public comment.

1111
01:57:18,592 --> 01:57:22,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature and message Danielle with a comment.

1112
01:57:22,956 --> 01:57:26,839
[SPEAKER_03]: You can also send an email to ocd.networkopenma.gov.

1113
01:57:27,359 --> 01:57:30,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.

1114
01:57:31,122 --> 01:57:37,387
[SPEAKER_03]: A reminder to all meeting participants to please refrain from using the chat function to provide comments as it is not part of the public record.

1115
01:57:37,827 --> 01:57:44,352
[SPEAKER_03]: However, if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, this may be entered into the chat to alert myself and the staff.

1116
01:57:45,867 --> 01:57:51,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Danielle, do you have any previously sent emails or comments?

1117
01:57:54,012 --> 01:58:05,199
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't seen any public comments in email and I don't see anyone in attendance tonight.

1118
01:58:06,560 --> 01:58:10,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, then I will close the public comment period for this meeting.

1119
01:58:11,390 --> 01:58:25,922
[SPEAKER_03]: And at this point, if the board has no final comments, I'm going to ask for a motion to recommend to the city council, recommend approval of proposed amendments to the city council as presented.

1120
01:58:27,263 --> 01:58:35,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, if the city can help with this, we would recommend also to add the footnotes as brought up by Director Hunt.

1121
01:58:35,769 --> 01:58:38,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Director Hunt, if you could actually help us to wordsmith that.

1122
01:58:40,186 --> 01:58:40,826
[SPEAKER_03]: Revision.

1123
01:58:44,889 --> 01:59:07,182
[SPEAKER_10]: I would recommend, perhaps may I suggest the language to recommend approval with the one edit of moving the footnotes, the number four superscript for footnotes from the left most column to the PC parking column.

1124
01:59:13,721 --> 01:59:23,405
[SPEAKER_03]: And with that, can I actually ask for a motion to recommend with direct the recommendation, uh, the approval of the proposed amendments to the city council.

1125
01:59:26,306 --> 01:59:29,028
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll make the motion and a second motion.

1126
01:59:31,789 --> 01:59:32,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1127
01:59:33,910 --> 01:59:36,331
[SPEAKER_03]: A roll call, uh, vice chair.

1128
01:59:37,471 --> 01:59:39,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Sally.

1129
01:59:39,092 --> 01:59:39,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1130
01:59:41,995 --> 01:59:43,575
[SPEAKER_03]: I. Ari Fishman.

1131
01:59:44,476 --> 01:59:46,716
[SPEAKER_03]: I. And myself, Jackie McPherson.

1132
01:59:46,836 --> 01:59:49,037
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm an I. Thank you so much, Ms.

1133
01:59:49,057 --> 01:59:50,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Sims, for your presentation.

1134
01:59:50,317 --> 01:59:54,978
[SPEAKER_03]: I truly, at least, really appreciate all of your work.

1135
01:59:55,718 --> 01:59:58,799
[SPEAKER_03]: I look forward to the rest.

1136
01:59:58,839 --> 01:59:59,379
[SPEAKER_11]: So are we.

1137
01:59:59,439 --> 02:00:01,199
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much, Madam Chair, members.

1138
02:00:01,219 --> 02:00:01,899
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a pleasure.

1139
02:00:01,919 --> 02:00:03,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a great evening.

1140
02:00:08,737 --> 02:00:12,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Number four is approval of minutes for 417.24.

1141
02:00:12,539 --> 02:00:25,466
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not, do, Danielle, do we have, so I know that we have a quorum and basically we're allowed, even if we weren't in attendance, we're allowed to vote the minutes into file, into record.

1142
02:00:25,727 --> 02:00:27,548
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, you're accepting the minutes.

1143
02:00:28,088 --> 02:00:29,489
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just accepting the minutes, okay.

1144
02:00:30,129 --> 02:00:33,411
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I can have a motion to approve the meeting minutes from 417.24.

1145
02:00:37,877 --> 02:00:39,098
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll make the motion to approve.

1146
02:00:40,398 --> 02:00:40,979
[SPEAKER_03]: And a second.

1147

[SPEAKER_13]: I'll second.

1148
02:00:43,280 --> 02:00:48,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, probably you can have it.

1149
02:00:48,583 --> 02:00:50,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice Chair Hedeman.

1150
02:00:51,464 --> 02:00:51,564
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

[SPEAKER_03]: I'm an aye.

1157
02:01:04,413 --> 02:01:13,056
[SPEAKER_03]: And now unless there's any other comments from the city or from the staff before we go to adjournment, is there any?

1158
02:01:13,076 --> 02:01:17,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so now I need a motion to adjourn.

1159
02:01:17,397 --> 02:01:20,559
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll just keep making motions.

1160
02:01:21,719 --> 02:01:23,179
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll make a motion to adjourn.

1161
02:01:24,040 --> 02:01:24,640
[SPEAKER_03]: And a second.

1162
02:01:26,148 --> 02:01:26,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, second.

1163
02:01:28,229 --> 02:01:29,069
