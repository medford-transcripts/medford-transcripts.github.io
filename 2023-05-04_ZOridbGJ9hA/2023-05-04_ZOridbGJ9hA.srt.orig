[SPEAKER_04]: Member Russo present.

31
00:02:29,344 --> 00:02:30,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, thank you.

32
00:02:32,726 --> 00:02:44,413
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, this is the purpose is to discuss an inclusion slash equity statement slash accommodation statement for Medford Public Schools.

33
00:02:44,473 --> 00:02:46,834
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm actually going to share my screen.

34
00:02:47,394 --> 00:02:49,736
[SPEAKER_04]: I will send this to this document to

35
00:02:51,737 --> 00:02:58,800
[SPEAKER_04]: the superintendent's office, Markey, after the meeting to share if needed, but I'll share my screen with folks as well.

36
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:08,565
[SPEAKER_04]: I did share it with committee members, with member Bowen, I mean, with Director of Pupil Services, Joan Bowen and Dr. Edward Vincent.

37
00:03:09,645 --> 00:03:14,788
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is a document that sort of helps outline some of the discussion that I'd like to use.

38
00:03:15,488 --> 00:03:16,549
[SPEAKER_07]: Bear with me one second.

39
00:03:20,438 --> 00:03:21,339
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you guys see my screen?

40
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:23,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

41
00:03:26,722 --> 00:03:27,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

42
00:03:28,924 --> 00:03:39,991
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is just some research done on some differences in non-discrimination statement versus inclusion statement.

43
00:03:40,031 --> 00:03:43,753
[SPEAKER_04]: So first of all, I wanna ground us in the work that we're doing right now.

44
00:03:44,914 --> 00:03:49,237
[SPEAKER_04]: So based on the Medford Public Schools strategic plan,

45
00:03:49,892 --> 00:03:50,872
[SPEAKER_04]: which has been approved.

46
00:03:51,052 --> 00:03:59,495
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the E in the ACES acronym that Dr. Edward Vincent uses in terms of the strategic plan.

47
00:04:00,155 --> 00:04:01,995
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a link to that.

48
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,236
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also available on our website.

49
00:04:05,716 --> 00:04:12,038
[SPEAKER_04]: And in there, within that, there's just a couple of statements that I think are relevant to the meeting today, which are

50
00:04:12,898 --> 00:04:20,920
[SPEAKER_04]: You know prioritize systems that support a shared vision for disability awareness anti racism anti bias and cultural proficiency across the district.

51
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:31,983
[SPEAKER_04]: and provide equal access to academic support and enrichment, so I really want to ground us in that part of the strategic plan, which is where we're really feeling like.

52
00:04:33,325 --> 00:04:42,980
[SPEAKER_04]: This statement applies and so folks may know that anybody receiving federal funds, of which most public schools do.

53
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:51,992
[SPEAKER_04]: they're required to have what's called a non-discrimination clause in their documentation on their website.

54
00:04:52,012 --> 00:04:57,133
[SPEAKER_04]: It's supposed to be pretty easy to find, very straightforward.

55
00:04:57,793 --> 00:05:01,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Ours is not particularly easy to find, and we can talk more about that shortly.

56
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:05,695
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, I just spent a bit of time just putting in

57
00:05:06,747 --> 00:05:14,910
[SPEAKER_04]: words like non-discrimination, disability, gender, sort of those things, and it didn't readily come up.

58
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:23,052
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a statement from the superintendent on the homepage that talks a little bit about it, but it's not an actual non-discrimination clause.

59
00:05:23,112 --> 00:05:30,675
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some, both in our policy, school committee policy statement and on some of the

60
00:05:35,538 --> 00:05:37,599
[SPEAKER_04]: the ADA requirements on the website.

61
00:05:37,619 --> 00:05:40,259
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, I definitely think it could be more prominent.

62
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:58,083
[SPEAKER_04]: But in any case, the non-discrimination clause is required, and it's, you know, what you typically see, people are probably really familiar with it, meant for public schools or your employment or any other place does not discriminate on the basis of, you know, so on and so forth.

63
00:05:58,803 --> 00:05:58,983
[SPEAKER_04]: And

64
00:06:01,422 --> 00:06:09,769
[SPEAKER_04]: The definition of non-discrimination is the practice of treating people, companies, countries, et cetera, and the same as others in order to be fair.

65
00:06:09,789 --> 00:06:21,919
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I just wanted to share the definition of inclusion because I don't necessarily think that a non-discrimination statement or clause is also an inclusion clause.

66
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:25,562
[SPEAKER_04]: A well-written one should be, but that's not always the case.

67
00:06:26,433 --> 00:06:36,178
[SPEAKER_04]: And so inclusion by definition is, and again this definition is from, you know, the CDC among others but they, I believe, took it from some of the laws and IDA what have you.

68
00:06:36,818 --> 00:06:39,780
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's that all children regardless of ability or disability.

69
00:06:40,906 --> 00:06:51,090
[SPEAKER_04]: have the right to be respected and appreciated as valuable members of the school community, fully participate in all school activities, and interact with peers of all ability levels with opportunities to develop friendships.

70
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,411
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a little bit different than non-discrimination.

71
00:06:53,931 --> 00:06:56,272
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd like to say it's more strength-based, frankly.

72
00:06:56,292 --> 00:06:56,952
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's nice.

73
00:06:57,012 --> 00:07:04,015
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't sort of have that, you know, some of the negative language that sometimes people see in the non-discrimination around

74
00:07:05,715 --> 00:07:11,880
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some articles that I've referenced in here that folks can link to and check out if they want to just around the differences between the two.

75
00:07:13,854 --> 00:07:21,356
[SPEAKER_04]: I do want to share an example from the community of one example of an inclusion form, if you will.

76
00:07:21,376 --> 00:07:34,698
[SPEAKER_04]: And this was something that the Medford Special Education Parent Advisory Council and others, community members, worked with the Medford Recreation Department to include on all of their documentation.

77
00:07:34,798 --> 00:07:37,819
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a good example of something within the community.

78
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:41,240
[SPEAKER_04]: And so on all Medford Recreation

79
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:53,232
[SPEAKER_04]: notices, notification, what have you, they have the statement you see here for participants who wish to request special accommodations for program, please fill out our inclusion services request form.

80
00:07:54,119 --> 00:07:59,180
[SPEAKER_04]: and please submit the form to, and you have the email here to submit the form to.

81
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:08,221
[SPEAKER_04]: In a minute, if folks want, I can click on that hyperlink and we can look at an example of the inclusion services request form.

82
00:08:09,162 --> 00:08:21,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Here are some references to the conversation that I'm having now and sort of the origin of some of the conversation and the requirements for non-discrimination, but also some of them that expand to

83
00:08:24,468 --> 00:08:24,948
[SPEAKER_04]: inclusion.

84
00:08:26,689 --> 00:08:47,998
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, I'm not a lawyer, I'm not gonna get into the legal aspects, but under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and ADA, particularly in IDA as well, there are requirements to be inclusive of all persons, including students with disabilities, of course.

85
00:08:49,632 --> 00:08:51,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's some resources I shared with you guys.

86
00:08:52,413 --> 00:09:00,614
[SPEAKER_04]: The first is just an article written by a professor that I thought was pretty interesting on how she makes her syllabus more inclusive and the way that it's evolved over time.

87
00:09:00,654 --> 00:09:12,437
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thought that was sort of interesting, particularly having studied inclusive education at the Harvard Graduate School of Education and working with Professor Hare there and him often talking about ways that we're actually

88
00:09:13,317 --> 00:09:19,924
[SPEAKER_04]: considering being inclusive and the ways that, you know, he would often let people know they can stand up and stretch if they need to.

89
00:09:19,984 --> 00:09:23,848
[SPEAKER_04]: They can sort of, he always made us use a microphone to make sure everyone could hear.

90
00:09:23,888 --> 00:09:30,094
[SPEAKER_04]: There were just little different things that, ways to be inclusive beyond, you know, some of the standard

91
00:09:30,995 --> 00:09:32,156
[SPEAKER_04]: quote unquote accommodations.

92
00:09:33,397 --> 00:09:38,021
[SPEAKER_04]: The Every Student Initiative, I think, is something that you guys, you know, might want to take a look at.

93
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:41,964
[SPEAKER_04]: The link says ensure every student has access to high quality learning, but it's not just that.

94
00:09:42,004 --> 00:09:52,212
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also about life of the school, enrichment activities, athletics, and so, you know, essentially the 504 Rehabilitation Act, ADA, and

95
00:09:53,513 --> 00:09:55,735
[SPEAKER_04]: IDEA all apply to the life of the school.

96
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:59,118
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not just the academic day, it is the life of the school.

97
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:12,269
[SPEAKER_04]: So any activities that students participate in as a school-based activity, these can include volunteer activities, these can include enrichment activities from outside organizations, what have you.

98
00:10:12,289 --> 00:10:13,630
[SPEAKER_04]: But if they're the life of the school,

99
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:26,633
[SPEAKER_04]: meaning they're attached to the school, everyone in the school has been invited, they're in the school building, not necessarily have to be in the school building, but those sorts of things apply under ADA 504 and IDEA.

100
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:38,015
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm happy to go back to some of these documents if folks want to look at them for a second, but I just wanted to share that the purpose really is for us to look at

101
00:10:39,522 --> 00:10:42,264
[SPEAKER_04]: a sample inclusion statement or accommodation statement.

102
00:10:42,284 --> 00:10:44,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people call it accommodation statements.

103
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:54,212
[SPEAKER_04]: It's interesting because when you look at inclusion statements these days, what's coming up a lot is DEI, DEI statements, which are also really interesting and some people refer to

104
00:10:55,373 --> 00:10:57,855
[SPEAKER_04]: disability in their DEI statements and some people don't.

105
00:10:57,995 --> 00:11:14,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people it's strictly anti-racism, which is another conversation that folks have because we all know disability is part of diversity as is culture and language and race and lots of things.

106
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:18,850
[SPEAKER_04]: But that was interesting in the search, but we did find some good examples.

107
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:21,792
[SPEAKER_04]: So I sort of wanted to give you guys that as like a starting point.

108
00:11:23,001 --> 00:11:24,741
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's an example.

109
00:11:24,801 --> 00:11:27,842
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this might have been either from Harvard or from.

110
00:11:31,203 --> 00:11:33,343
[SPEAKER_04]: University of Virginia, but I can reference it if we need to.

111
00:11:34,243 --> 00:11:40,945
[SPEAKER_04]: So we value inclusion and access for all participants and are pleased to provide reasonable accommodations for this activity slash event.

112
00:11:41,745 --> 00:11:42,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Please contact.

113
00:11:43,645 --> 00:11:46,186
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, sensibly, this school committee or.

114
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:53,464
[SPEAKER_04]: the superintendent will have to clarify, would have to decide who a contact would be.

115
00:11:53,484 --> 00:11:59,709
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be potentially an assistant principal, it could be the 504 coordinator, it could be director of pupil services.

116
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:08,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Please contact so-and-so to make a reasonable accommodation request, and then a date for a request to be submitted, and then noting that the event is accessible.

117
00:12:09,737 --> 00:12:26,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Another organization said they recommend using an accommodation statement and publicity materials on all documents to let individuals know how to request accommodations for your event or program if needed, but also that it's accessible, like this event is wheelchair accessible or any of the other accessibility standards that we need to know.

118
00:12:27,672 --> 00:12:29,274
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to stop there for a second.

119
00:12:29,414 --> 00:12:35,879
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to just show you guys a little bit more further down about

120
00:12:39,202 --> 00:12:40,603
[SPEAKER_04]: sort of some of the things that we can look at.

121
00:12:40,663 --> 00:12:57,695
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to look at some examples from Medford Public Schools about what's currently on our website and otherwise, and then some examples from other school districts about what's on their website, and then hopefully have a more robust conversation as well.

122
00:12:58,216 --> 00:13:08,363
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just want to stop right there for a minute and let my colleagues and others take a breath and see if there are any questions or comments so far.

123
00:13:12,547 --> 00:13:13,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Alex has a question, I think.

124
00:13:14,408 --> 00:13:15,188
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, thanks.

125
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:21,132
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so first of all, I was wondering if the school events also include events organized by PTO.

126
00:13:21,872 --> 00:13:26,455
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, for instance, I only know examples from Roberts and from McGlynn.

127
00:13:26,495 --> 00:13:33,078
[SPEAKER_08]: But at Roberts, for instance, the enrichment after class, after school clubs were organized by PTO.

128
00:13:33,659 --> 00:13:40,262
[SPEAKER_08]: And at McGlynn, the school dance, the fun night, the game night, everything is organized by PTO.

129
00:13:42,453 --> 00:13:48,476
[SPEAKER_08]: staff is not required to attend and they usually don't other than the principal and the assistant principal.

130
00:13:48,516 --> 00:13:51,277
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was wondering if what you talked about includes that.

131
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:57,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I would defer to Joan on that, but I would say yes, anything that is the life of the school.

132
00:13:57,781 --> 00:14:08,426
[SPEAKER_04]: So if they're using school facilities, if it's including all school, all non-disabled students, if there are opportunities for that, then yes, but I want to ask the director of pupil services for perspective.

133
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:11,379
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I agree with that statement as well.

134
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,041
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the life of the school.

135
00:14:13,161 --> 00:14:26,410
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it's any activity that is within a school building, reasonable accommodations should be offered if we are made aware of what those may be.

136
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:34,836
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think CPAC and I have a monthly admin meeting and we talked about this the other day saying a lot of parents don't

137
00:14:35,737 --> 00:14:39,899
[SPEAKER_01]: realize that there can be, they can request reasonable accommodations.

138
00:14:40,419 --> 00:14:50,202
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's getting that information out to parents that if your child's going to attend a school dance, and they may need some support, that we can put a plan into place.

139
00:14:50,242 --> 00:14:55,684
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it's a student on an IEP, I would say that they work with their evaluation team leader.

140
00:14:55,704 --> 00:15:03,467
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's a student on the 504, you might want to talk to if they have a guidance counselor or the 504 coordinator in that building.

141
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:06,934
[SPEAKER_04]: And each building has a 504 coordinator?

142
00:15:07,454 --> 00:15:07,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

143
00:15:08,414 --> 00:15:09,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you.

144
00:15:10,995 --> 00:15:13,115
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, just a follow up question.

145
00:15:13,135 --> 00:15:24,499
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was wondering if the statement that we are trying to put together now is something that is going to be on the website or is something that potentially would be sent, for instance, with emails announcing these events?

146
00:15:25,263 --> 00:15:26,404
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a good question.

147
00:15:26,444 --> 00:15:28,324
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's something that I really want the group to discuss.

148
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:37,008
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think, so not only obviously the enrichment activities, the life of the schools, but obviously this applies to field trips, this applies to all things.

149
00:15:37,108 --> 00:15:47,693
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is a big reason that we wanted to have this meeting today is because it is the fact that a lot of parents don't know that students are entitled to accommodations for life of the school.

150
00:15:48,413 --> 00:15:52,695
[SPEAKER_04]: And frankly, there are a lot of staff members that might not understand that as well.

151
00:15:53,856 --> 00:16:09,937
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think it's important that this information goes out to you know any information that is that is a life of the school event so if it's an email going out from the principals about a school based activity if it's a potentially.

152
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:14,301
[SPEAKER_04]: a field trip form, anything, you know, similar to a nondiscrimination.

153
00:16:14,381 --> 00:16:30,692
[SPEAKER_04]: So, one of the suggestions I had is to include the nondiscrimination statement on documentation and with an additional, you know, sentence or two around, you know, if your student requires accommodations, right, what you can do.

154
00:16:30,812 --> 00:16:32,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Because really, we're supposed to be doing this.

155
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:34,414
[SPEAKER_04]: This is not like, you know,

156
00:16:35,621 --> 00:16:36,562
[SPEAKER_04]: a favor we're asking.

157
00:16:36,602 --> 00:16:38,804
[SPEAKER_04]: This is something that the district's really supposed to be doing.

158
00:16:40,045 --> 00:16:47,010
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that how is the information actually reaching families and getting to families and getting to staff and it's not quite clear how that is.

159
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:49,192
[SPEAKER_04]: I see Shanine has her hand up.

160
00:16:51,232 --> 00:16:54,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, I was a couple minutes late because I was actually on the phone with the New England.

161
00:16:54,193 --> 00:16:56,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, can you let us know who you are and your name?

162
00:16:56,754 --> 00:16:58,034
[SPEAKER_04]: I meant to do that with you, Alex.

163
00:16:58,094 --> 00:16:58,815
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize.

164
00:16:59,055 --> 00:17:00,375
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, Shanine, please.

165
00:17:00,575 --> 00:17:02,096
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Shanine Peliquin.

166
00:17:02,276 --> 00:17:07,977
[SPEAKER_02]: I am a recreation therapist and a parent of a third grader at the Roberts and an incoming kindergartner.

167
00:17:10,298 --> 00:17:19,141
[SPEAKER_02]: So it seems to me that the procedure needs to be different for a field trip versus after school activities because field trips are being

168
00:17:19,607 --> 00:17:48,562
[SPEAKER_02]: offered as part of the school day and the children have their like the default should be how are we going to help this kid participate not we have to wait for the parent to say yes I want them to go because it's their right to go on the field trip and you'd have to like look ahead and and see what it looked like if they were going to the constitution you know like maybe the transportation would need to be accessible if you have a kid with a mobility related disability and then like what can they actually do when they get there

169
00:17:50,609 --> 00:17:55,131
[SPEAKER_02]: But the default should be the child is expected to go with their class.

170
00:17:56,331 --> 00:18:14,859
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after school activities, I think we definitely need to address even down to kids with EpiPens, because right now at the Roberts, a kid with an EpiPen is not allowed to attend the after school program because the parents say that they're not related to the school, even though it's a school advertised

171
00:18:15,389 --> 00:18:21,914
[SPEAKER_02]: school space immediately after school run by the PTO that is sponsored by the school.

172
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:28,079
[SPEAKER_02]: So regardless of it being a parent who's volunteering, it is the school's responsibility to make sure that that child gets to participate.

173
00:18:28,099 --> 00:18:30,261
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a major concern of mine.

174
00:18:30,981 --> 00:18:39,668
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that's why you get into kids who have IEPs that need more social support to participate and their lack of access to these programs.

175
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:42,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, she and I couldn't agree more.

176
00:18:43,012 --> 00:18:56,023
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that there's some policy pieces here too that we need to talk about so you know definitely we might want to be, you know, to the other committee members, I would think that there are some things that we might recommend or refer to the rules policy and equity.

177
00:18:56,683 --> 00:19:16,027
[SPEAKER_04]: subcommittee potentially with recommendations from the special behavioral health subcommittee and or a joint meeting around, you know, obviously you're absolutely right field trips are, you know, accommodations are required for field trips for students to meaningfully attend a field trip during the school day.

178
00:19:16,047 --> 00:19:17,788
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the difference and again,

179
00:19:19,008 --> 00:19:30,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Joan, I would defer to you, but I think that a little bit of the difference is the difference potentially in reasonable quote unquote accommodations, right?

180
00:19:30,133 --> 00:19:36,696
[SPEAKER_04]: So reasonable accommodations, but if it's in the life of the school, there is a, you know, aspect of that.

181
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:42,259
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, there's been some historically some experience and I totally and fully understand that the PTOs are,

182
00:19:42,877 --> 00:19:44,678
[SPEAKER_04]: volunteer organizations, right?

183
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:50,922
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of these events are fundraisers or afterschool enrichment opportunities or what have you.

184
00:19:51,762 --> 00:20:05,271
[SPEAKER_04]: And if they're going to be held in the school and they're going to be offered to all students in the school, students with disabilities cannot be excluded under federal law, among other things.

185
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,692
[SPEAKER_04]: So the issue is not whether that's

186
00:20:09,495 --> 00:20:20,584
[SPEAKER_04]: appropriate or not, in my opinion, the issue is how do we make sure that everybody's informed that students with disabilities and all students need to have access.

187
00:20:20,624 --> 00:20:28,731
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if there are students that require additional accommodations, then we need to create a plan for them to be able to reach out to, again, Ms.

188
00:20:28,751 --> 00:20:33,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Bowen has said, the ETL or building principal, which I think we should be really clear about.

189
00:20:33,695 --> 00:20:35,237
[SPEAKER_04]: to discuss a reasonable accommodation.

190
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:39,520
[SPEAKER_04]: And we do, a lot of the reasonable accommodation requests have a date on them.

191
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:43,764
[SPEAKER_04]: So for example, with Medford Recreation, they have a reasonable accommodation request.

192
00:20:43,924 --> 00:20:58,757
[SPEAKER_04]: If your student, if your child needs, you know, additional support to participate in this activity, please let us know by X date, you know, if say, so that we're not finding out, so that the school's not finding out the day before, you know, that there's a request for accommodations or something like that.

193
00:20:58,877 --> 00:20:59,798
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Tanya?

194
00:21:00,784 --> 00:21:01,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

195
00:21:01,424 --> 00:21:02,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi Mel.

196
00:21:02,645 --> 00:21:02,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

197
00:21:02,945 --> 00:21:04,446
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to just jump in.

198
00:21:04,486 --> 00:21:05,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you introduce yourself?

199
00:21:05,726 --> 00:21:06,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

200
00:21:06,126 --> 00:21:06,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

201
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:07,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Tanya Sullivan.

202
00:21:07,487 --> 00:21:13,610
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a child in the post-grad program and project transition.

203
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:22,173
[SPEAKER_03]: I am co-chair of Medford CPAC and also on this subcommittee.

204
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:25,595
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wanted to kind of

205
00:21:26,425 --> 00:21:26,985
[SPEAKER_03]: bring to light.

206
00:21:27,045 --> 00:21:32,306
[SPEAKER_03]: It kind of ties with what everybody's saying, with what Shanine was saying, with what Alex was saying, with what Joan was saying.

207
00:21:33,326 --> 00:21:41,008
[SPEAKER_03]: When we had our meeting with administration, we were talking about full disclosure, really.

208
00:21:41,408 --> 00:21:44,548
[SPEAKER_03]: So having the information available ahead of time.

209
00:21:44,648 --> 00:21:46,388
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll give you an example.

210
00:21:46,769 --> 00:21:53,810
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's a school dance and there's no language that says that there can be supports,

211
00:21:56,067 --> 00:22:00,891
[SPEAKER_03]: then a lot of parents of kids with disabilities are just not gonna go.

212
00:22:01,492 --> 00:22:14,143
[SPEAKER_03]: They're gonna just say, it's not worth the aggravation trying to figure out what to do, as opposed to having the language there already, if you need supports, let this person know.

213
00:22:14,463 --> 00:22:20,769
[SPEAKER_03]: We just think that things have been reactive instead of proactive.

214
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:36,255
[SPEAKER_03]: So like Shanine was saying, instead of waiting to see if parents say they want their kids to go on a field trip, making sure that all the supports are in place for when and if those parents say their child is going on a field trip.

215
00:22:36,595 --> 00:22:42,461
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just, it really boils down to getting ahead of it, getting ahead of it instead of being behind it.

216
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:45,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

217
00:22:45,323 --> 00:22:45,784
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think

218
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,361
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate that.

219
00:22:47,761 --> 00:22:50,684
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd love to hear from some of the members of the subcommittee as well.

220
00:22:50,764 --> 00:22:55,949
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that part of the issue too, is that the onus should not be on parents, right?

221
00:22:56,349 --> 00:23:08,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Parents of children with disabilities, I can speak for myself personally, especially a child with complex healthcare needs and other disabilities, multiple disabilities.

222
00:23:10,202 --> 00:23:11,123
[SPEAKER_04]: The last thing that,

223
00:23:12,173 --> 00:23:22,881
[SPEAKER_04]: we need to be, you know, burdened with, if you will, is to convince other people that our child, our children, our child are entitled to attend events at their school.

224
00:23:22,961 --> 00:23:30,908
[SPEAKER_04]: And for that matter, you know, out-of-district students are also connected to school buildings, so they're a part of the school as well.

225
00:23:31,628 --> 00:23:37,753
[SPEAKER_04]: So if there are out-of-district students whose families, who should also be getting this information, whose families

226
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:42,927
[SPEAKER_04]: and whose children want to actively participate in the life of the school, because the life of the school is community.

227
00:23:43,007 --> 00:23:44,168
[SPEAKER_04]: It's part of building community.

228
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:47,972
[SPEAKER_04]: It's part of building skills and friendships and all the things that we're talking about.

229
00:23:48,432 --> 00:23:55,598
[SPEAKER_04]: They are also obviously need, you know, reasonable accommodations, then we need to know that.

230
00:23:55,678 --> 00:24:03,986
[SPEAKER_04]: I do want to share, if I could, well, actually I want to stop for a second and see if any of the subcommittee members have any questions or comments.

231
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:14,902
[SPEAKER_06]: Melanie, just, sorry, I'm on my phone, which I'm not used to.

232
00:24:14,942 --> 00:24:17,904
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm taking a little minute to get used to doing it.

233
00:24:18,964 --> 00:24:28,351
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree with everyone that everyone's saying, and it's, I can't believe we don't already do all this for our parents and making sure all the kids are included in all the school activities.

234
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:30,912
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just, I'm trying to be clear.

235
00:24:30,973 --> 00:24:38,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we writing a policy to just like, is it looking for funding to make sure that staff's available for like,

236
00:24:39,903 --> 00:24:43,445
[SPEAKER_06]: What do we need to do to make this happen that everything is available for all the kids?

237
00:24:44,046 --> 00:24:44,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

238
00:24:44,426 --> 00:24:45,066
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate that.

239
00:24:45,106 --> 00:24:49,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, first of all, again, it's the law, so it's really compliance, right?

240
00:24:49,269 --> 00:24:51,911
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really about being in compliance with the law, first and foremost.

241
00:24:51,951 --> 00:25:00,096
[SPEAKER_04]: So we need to make sure that we're complying so that we're not subject to, you know, potential hearings or what have you.

242
00:25:00,456 --> 00:25:01,997
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's number one is so compliance.

243
00:25:02,097 --> 00:25:06,380
[SPEAKER_04]: And then number two, yeah, it could definitely affect the budget, I would say, in some circumstances.

244
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,341
[SPEAKER_04]: In others, it might not.

245
00:25:08,181 --> 00:25:26,729
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it depends on what the reasonable accommodations are and I think that has to be sort of a case by case basis but I would defer again to the director of people services and we, you know, in terms of what what the implications of that are but it's also the point of this right now is really to craft.

246
00:25:27,838 --> 00:25:47,377
[SPEAKER_04]: a statement that we can bring forward either to, you know, well, to the to the committee to the school committee as a whole, who then may refer to the rules, policy and equity subcommittee, possibly they may not, you know, if they do, I would definitely recommend a very specific date for that, because this we've been out of compliance for a bit around getting

247
00:25:47,697 --> 00:25:57,771
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, technically, some of this stuff is on the website, so you could say, technically, we're not out of compliance, but if students are being told that there's that there I mean, if families are being told that there.

248
00:25:58,793 --> 00:26:05,077
[SPEAKER_04]: students or child cannot participate in a life of the school activity, that is a potential out of compliance.

249
00:26:06,077 --> 00:26:12,961
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, if families don't know that, you know, that's one thing, but districts should know it and should know what that means.

250
00:26:13,061 --> 00:26:23,147
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I think there could be costs involved, but really the purpose of this right now is to craft a statement that we feel comfortable with as a special education behavioral health subcommittee moving forward with

251
00:26:24,268 --> 00:26:28,494
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, putting it forward to the rest of the school committee to see, you know, what their perspective is on that.

252
00:26:29,095 --> 00:26:34,684
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wanted to share with you maybe for a minute if there's nothing from other members of the committee.

253
00:26:34,704 --> 00:26:36,907
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on for a second.

254
00:26:40,671 --> 00:26:47,998
[SPEAKER_04]: sounds like there's not, then we can, you know, I can show you this is sort of an old nondiscrimination statement.

255
00:26:48,018 --> 00:26:55,025
[SPEAKER_04]: So actually, if you Google nondiscrimination in Medford public schools, this is the first thing that comes up, which is a very old

256
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:16,072
[SPEAKER_04]: The old statement from you know cat that Kathy McDowell, you can see she's the grievance coordinator for 504 put up so it's 504 title nine title to there's a lot of other things that apply to non discrimination, but the specific to students with disabilities are the 504 IDA and potentially title nine but.

257
00:27:17,462 --> 00:27:18,202
[SPEAKER_04]: I forget the other one.

258
00:27:18,222 --> 00:27:20,583
[SPEAKER_04]: I just the other one we noted here so.

259
00:27:21,623 --> 00:27:25,104
[SPEAKER_04]: It's up father, so that's an old, but that's the first thing that comes up.

260
00:27:25,664 --> 00:27:33,406
[SPEAKER_04]: If you if you Google it from Medford, if you look at the this is our URL on the civil rights statement that we have.

261
00:27:33,466 --> 00:27:36,507
[SPEAKER_04]: So annually was supposed to provide a civil rights statement for the district.

262
00:27:37,587 --> 00:27:39,688
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is what's on currently on the website.

263
00:27:40,348 --> 00:27:42,429
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, we can see that this is out of date, right?

264
00:27:42,449 --> 00:27:46,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Like so we know that there's disability and there's some information on, you know, civil rights.

265
00:27:47,763 --> 00:27:59,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Rehabilitation Act 504 Title one and some other civil rights laws, but you can see that still has you know Diane and old school committee members on and so these are things that just need to be updated, I would think.

266
00:28:01,248 --> 00:28:01,348
[SPEAKER_04]: um.

267
00:28:02,579 --> 00:28:18,829
[SPEAKER_04]: In terms of the website update, which we are doing, or we're going to be advising as part of the Family and Community Engagement Subcommittee, and we made a motion last week for that to happen with accessibility and other information on the website to make sure it's updated.

268
00:28:18,849 --> 00:28:24,913
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think this could potentially fall under that, but I'm just sort of sharing that there are some things on the website.

269
00:28:25,013 --> 00:28:26,654
[SPEAKER_04]: They can be hard to find.

270
00:28:26,715 --> 00:28:28,496
[SPEAKER_04]: They can be few and far between.

271
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:35,074
[SPEAKER_04]: And then a lot of them are outdated and again a lot of them are specific more to non discrimination than they are to.

272
00:28:36,592 --> 00:28:38,394
[SPEAKER_04]: accommodation or inclusion.

273
00:28:38,414 --> 00:28:43,317
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we also have a school committee policy on non-discrimination.

274
00:28:43,377 --> 00:28:50,123
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's the AC non-discrimination policy, which is part of the MASC boilerplate, if you will.

275
00:28:50,763 --> 00:28:53,385
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we did have a little bit of changes to this.

276
00:28:53,425 --> 00:29:02,453
[SPEAKER_04]: I think member Rousseau might remember better, but as a member of the rules policy and equity subcommittee, I believe that we did have some review of this language change, but not

277
00:29:03,113 --> 00:29:03,373
[SPEAKER_04]: fully.

278
00:29:03,413 --> 00:29:06,495
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, it's a little bit different from an accommodation statement.

279
00:29:06,515 --> 00:29:08,876
[SPEAKER_04]: So a non-discrimination statement is different.

280
00:29:09,496 --> 00:29:16,120
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see, you know, it talks about an integrated society, it talks about positive experiences, it talks about

281
00:29:16,627 --> 00:29:32,590
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, other things, and it's the policy, not to discriminate and sort of what happens if you do discriminate or could happen if you do discriminate, but it doesn't talk about well what if you need accommodations, what if you need, you know, other things it doesn't sort of take that next step on our policy.

282
00:29:33,791 --> 00:29:35,373
[SPEAKER_04]: But the other is the school lunch.

283
00:29:35,413 --> 00:29:49,865
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also something on non-discrimination under the school lunch because they're required by the USDA federal organization to anyone that gets for federal funding is required to publicly state and have a public facing non-discrimination statement.

284
00:29:50,585 --> 00:29:58,386
[SPEAKER_04]: So I noticed that our school lunch department has one on their page under the USDA requirement.

285
00:30:00,547 --> 00:30:03,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Just quickly, a sample from Newton Public Schools.

286
00:30:03,227 --> 00:30:05,788
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a non-discrimination statement from Newton Public Schools.

287
00:30:05,868 --> 00:30:07,928
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not necessarily an accommodation statement.

288
00:30:08,008 --> 00:30:10,549
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't done a deep dive into other districts to see about that.

289
00:30:11,149 --> 00:30:17,990
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the things I liked about the Newton Public Schools non-discrimination statement is that as you can see here where I highlight,

290
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:28,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Newton Public Schools does not exclude from participation, deny the benefits of Newton Public Schools from or otherwise discriminate against any of these individuals.

291
00:30:29,179 --> 00:30:34,924
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, that exclude from participation is part of it, deny the benefits of, you know, is another part of it.

292
00:30:34,964 --> 00:30:37,466
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're sort of covering themselves there under

293
00:30:38,653 --> 00:30:49,653
[SPEAKER_04]: the being more, you know, broad in terms of making sure that people aren't being excluded, although, again, there's no direct instruction on how to get accommodations or to request accommodations if your student needs to.

294
00:30:57,145 --> 00:31:02,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they talked about, Marblehead I liked, it talked about being proactive allies, fostering belonging and acceptance.

295
00:31:02,307 --> 00:31:11,590
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, these are more DEI statements, I mean, more non-discrimination statements than they are active accommodation statements, but there's some sort of examples.

296
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:16,672
[SPEAKER_04]: But going back to the top now, and again, this document would be available.

297
00:31:17,492 --> 00:31:23,055
[SPEAKER_04]: to all, and I would very much recommend that people look at some of these if they're so inclined.

298
00:31:23,956 --> 00:31:30,420
[SPEAKER_04]: I also just wanted to share there was a recent Supreme Court ruling for a deaf student, which I'm sure Joan is very well aware of this.

299
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:36,564
[SPEAKER_04]: This was a landmark decision that just happened recently, where a student

300
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:49,083
[SPEAKER_04]: who was, you know, not receiving accommodations in his school district, not just related to academics, but to all activities, was able to exhaust all of his efforts, both under IDEA and ADA.

301
00:31:49,623 --> 00:31:56,705
[SPEAKER_04]: So in some instances, IDEA, you know, it is through the Problem Resolution Service where system or

302
00:31:57,783 --> 00:32:01,769
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah, problem resolution system, no, program quality assurance, PQA, sorry.

303
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,573
[SPEAKER_04]: But in any case, it's through that system.

304
00:32:04,593 --> 00:32:10,902
[SPEAKER_04]: And ADA, which is the civil rights piece, is through the Office of Civil Rights in terms of people who want to, you know,

305
00:32:12,286 --> 00:32:14,827
[SPEAKER_04]: who have a complaint and want the complaint to be explored.

306
00:32:15,327 --> 00:32:25,009
[SPEAKER_04]: This ruling was landmark and it just happened like a month or two ago because it said that a student is not limited to one or the other, that they can actually file claims under both.

307
00:32:25,589 --> 00:32:38,452
[SPEAKER_04]: So they can file claims under both IDEA for some of the academics, the accommodations around that and ADA, which can open districts up potentially to twice as much liability.

308
00:32:38,472 --> 00:32:41,113
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's an important ruling

309
00:32:42,473 --> 00:32:44,575
[SPEAKER_04]: frankly, I think all districts should know about.

310
00:32:44,695 --> 00:32:53,223
[SPEAKER_04]: I know certainly if I was still in my policy class at the School of Ed, we would be studying this inside and out, because it's a really important decision.

311
00:32:53,884 --> 00:33:06,336
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are a few, there are probably like a handful, maybe between five and 10 landmark decisions over the years, past 40 years, that have to do with individuals with disabilities in schools, and so they're really important, and that's one.

312
00:33:07,908 --> 00:33:11,470
[SPEAKER_04]: So getting back to a proposal of a statement.

313
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:14,392
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of the things that I had and I can highlight it.

314
00:33:14,572 --> 00:33:22,458
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is just, you know, an example and maybe we could just tweak this a little bit if folks are amenable.

315
00:33:22,498 --> 00:33:35,286
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we have 26 more minutes left so that we can think about what this might look like again to present to the larger committee.

316
00:33:36,511 --> 00:33:39,597
[SPEAKER_04]: If this subcommittee agrees, that's what they want to do.

317
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:48,235
[SPEAKER_04]: So if folks want to take a look at that statement for a second, you can feel free to raise your hand if you have things you want to add or

318
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:12,148
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember McLaughlin?

319
00:34:12,708 --> 00:34:13,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, member Russo.

320
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:17,312
[SPEAKER_05]: Which policy will this be amended to and where?

321
00:34:18,212 --> 00:34:22,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's um, well, it doesn't actually partially exist in the policy.

322
00:34:22,556 --> 00:34:24,877
[SPEAKER_04]: So we just were talking about this a moment ago.

323
00:34:25,018 --> 00:34:30,021
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a non discrimination policy AC right there that we currently have.

324
00:34:30,042 --> 00:34:36,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so it's the it's the proposal to make this language be number was it five or six?

325
00:34:38,137 --> 00:34:40,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Potentially, if that's what the subcommittee decides.

326
00:34:41,278 --> 00:34:51,042
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, first we have to craft the language, and then potentially there's a motion to, you know, add it to the policy under non-discrimination.

327
00:34:52,963 --> 00:35:01,166
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that could be a recommendation that we're making to the larger committee, sort of waiting to see what you guys are thinking in terms of as we craft the language.

328
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:19,064
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't think it would be clearly, I wanna say, I don't think it's just something that's embedded in policy on the school committee page that you have to dig deep on school committee policy to be able to find this.

329
00:35:19,164 --> 00:35:34,672
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that part of the other discussion is that this needs to be on documents that go to family members about life of the school activities and also on our website, clearly on,

330
00:35:36,277 --> 00:35:50,923
[SPEAKER_04]: the CPAC, it could be pinned on the CPAC page, but also, you know, potentially at, you know, you know, on, I don't know, I don't know if it's N1 Jones or somewhere else that it could be provided to at 504 or IEP meetings.

331
00:35:51,003 --> 00:35:54,705
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, just being able to make sure that we get this information out to the district

332
00:35:55,228 --> 00:36:08,980
[SPEAKER_04]: to families, to school community members, to teachers, to staff, because there are also teachers and staff that don't necessarily understand that, you know, this federal law.

333
00:36:10,381 --> 00:36:10,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

334
00:36:10,781 --> 00:36:19,448
[SPEAKER_05]: I just, I don't have any problem with the language with the exception of the fact that the policy, I mean, it's just like the blue stuff,

335
00:36:21,917 --> 00:36:24,519
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the like the insert date.

336
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:26,480
[SPEAKER_05]: That's actually would be part of the policy, right?

337
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:27,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

338
00:36:28,241 --> 00:36:31,443
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, looks like contact name and date member or so.

339
00:36:31,503 --> 00:36:32,363
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, you're right.

340
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:35,946
[SPEAKER_04]: That would need to be like policy so that they understand what the process is.

341
00:36:36,006 --> 00:36:38,067
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we're talking about process and policy, yes.

342
00:36:40,048 --> 00:36:41,509
[SPEAKER_01]: Melanie, Alex has her hand up.

343
00:36:41,869 --> 00:36:42,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, thank you, Alex.

344
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:44,031
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, member.

345
00:36:44,091 --> 00:36:44,671
[SPEAKER_04]: So are you done?

346
00:36:45,792 --> 00:36:45,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

347
00:36:46,392 --> 00:36:48,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, thank you, Alex.

348
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:51,395
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm Alex, I'm the co-chair of my seat back.

349
00:36:52,042 --> 00:36:53,724
[SPEAKER_08]: and parent of a child at McGlynn.

350
00:36:54,485 --> 00:37:08,100
[SPEAKER_08]: So just to clarify, the policy would be something like the following language will be added to all communication from school to parents regarding events or something like that, and then we insert the language.

351
00:37:09,113 --> 00:37:30,545
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, to be clear, this special education subcommittee can recommend to the committee of the whole, so the entire seven member body, that this language be included as part of a policy that Medford Public Schools includes on this policy statement or what have you, and that

352
00:37:31,525 --> 00:37:47,094
[SPEAKER_04]: The committee as a seven member body can vote whether that's acceptable and or they can vote whether that needs more discussion and they'd like it to be part of the rules, policy and equity subcommittee, in which case I might ask that we have a joint subcommittee meeting of special ed.

353
00:37:47,914 --> 00:37:54,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Behavioral health and rules, policy and equity, but hopefully that would not be the case because I think it's pretty straightforward and it's obviously.

354
00:37:56,542 --> 00:38:12,211
[SPEAKER_04]: The law so really what I wanted you know this the intention of this meeting today was for us to come to an agreement on a. Accommodation inclusion statement that we would all feel comfortable putting forward.

355
00:38:20,002 --> 00:38:23,465
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it says what we're trying to say.

356
00:38:23,485 --> 00:38:30,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it possible that if something comes up later that we can revisit the language?

357
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:41,777
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that it's going to be an undertaking to get this on all documents, so I know that we want to try to get it right the first time, but I think the language in this is fine.

358
00:38:43,058 --> 00:38:43,819
[SPEAKER_04]: That's nice to hear.

359
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:44,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

360
00:38:45,632 --> 00:38:50,877
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, I think we're pretty much in an e-world, right, where everything is pretty much transmitted electronically.

361
00:38:50,977 --> 00:38:54,060
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't necessarily know that it's going to be a lot to put onto documents.

362
00:38:54,120 --> 00:39:06,351
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it can be simple, you know, cut and paste and, you know, maybe, you know, it can be included in, you know, potentially the superintendent's, you know, comments and, you know, that we start to see it in documentation, what have you.

363
00:39:08,014 --> 00:39:12,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think that it is something that can always be revisited.

364
00:39:12,576 --> 00:39:17,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything can be revisited if the committee votes to have it revisited.

365
00:39:21,381 --> 00:39:21,781
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

366
00:39:22,582 --> 00:39:22,762
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

367
00:39:25,997 --> 00:39:30,738
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just wanted to say, to be clear, there are elements of this already and on our website.

368
00:39:30,758 --> 00:39:34,299
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think, you know, we've had a fabulous revamp of our website.

369
00:39:34,319 --> 00:39:35,480
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's incredible.

370
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:39,041
[SPEAKER_04]: I do think that this should be more forward-facing.

371
00:39:39,081 --> 00:39:50,404
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that, frankly, it should be on the cover page of, you know, each of the websites or in at least small print on the bottom that, you know, Medford Public Schools does not discriminate on the basis of, you know, so on and so forth.

372
00:39:50,884 --> 00:39:54,285
[SPEAKER_04]: And then again, what I was suggesting is that, you know,

373
00:39:55,085 --> 00:40:08,692
[SPEAKER_04]: potentially the statement reads Medford Public Schools does not discriminate, right, the nondiscrimination clause that we have, which is on the basis of all of the things that we've included, you know, I don't want to go through them all now, because I don't want to miss any.

374
00:40:08,752 --> 00:40:13,094
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, I know that we have them in our policy, I know that there are other places in the website.

375
00:40:13,134 --> 00:40:16,875
[SPEAKER_04]: So that nondiscrimination clause does currently exist.

376
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:21,598
[SPEAKER_04]: So including that, and then in addition, you know, the accommodation statement.

377
00:40:21,638 --> 00:40:24,159
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's not just that we don't discriminate, it's

378
00:40:24,917 --> 00:40:30,281
[SPEAKER_04]: know, if you need reasonable accommodations, please, you know, here's the process on how to do that.

379
00:40:31,441 --> 00:40:33,703
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, I do think it's a really good practice.

380
00:40:33,863 --> 00:40:47,792
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's something that I'm going to mention also, at the city level, is that when there are, you know, public events that, you know, folks include in their materials, whether the event is accessible, which is really just sort of good practice.

381
00:40:48,413 --> 00:40:49,854
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, people do that all the time.

382
00:40:50,965 --> 00:40:54,766
[SPEAKER_04]: and they don't want to get in a situation where somebody shows up in the event is not accessible, right?

383
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:57,247
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's just good practice to do that.

384
00:41:02,189 --> 00:41:03,030
[SPEAKER_07]: Any other comments?

385
00:41:06,271 --> 00:41:06,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Seeing none.

386
00:41:07,791 --> 00:41:08,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

387
00:41:08,612 --> 00:41:10,352
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, sorry.

388
00:41:10,793 --> 00:41:11,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sorry, Superintendent.

389
00:41:11,973 --> 00:41:12,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

390
00:41:12,813 --> 00:41:14,014
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Sinead, I'll get to you next.

391
00:41:14,034 --> 00:41:14,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

392
00:41:14,857 --> 00:41:21,432
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I just, I just wanted to say we definitely value and believe in inclusion.

393
00:41:21,452 --> 00:41:23,577
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just thinking with

394
00:41:25,947 --> 00:41:45,957
[SPEAKER_00]: the timing of it being the end of the school year with transitions happening, is this something that you'd be recommending for the start of the next school year or something that you're saying you want to see happen like tomorrow?

395
00:41:46,577 --> 00:41:53,681
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I just feel like what the statement is saying is it's a

396
00:41:54,817 --> 00:41:56,338
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's a value statement.

397
00:41:56,838 --> 00:42:08,605
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing wrong with what's being said to be added to what's already there, but I guess I'm going to just need, I've been processing, but I'm going to need a little more clarification on where

398
00:42:11,265 --> 00:42:23,454
[SPEAKER_00]: This additional statement needs to be like on like you said on the Friday communications, you just were saying on the websites on every single piece of communication going out.

399
00:42:24,515 --> 00:42:29,959
[SPEAKER_00]: I just feel like where we don't even have we don't consistently.

400
00:42:31,492 --> 00:42:54,451
[SPEAKER_00]: use the non-discrimination statement as well, district-wide, that I almost feel like there needs to be training, you know, to let our secretaries, administrative assistants know, like to properly rule it out and say that this is something now we need to make a concerted effort to make sure that we're doing it.

401
00:42:57,312 --> 00:43:06,720
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, the essence of what the statement is saying, I'm not opposed to incorporating it.

402
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:19,209
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just thinking about the rollout and if one person gets missed and then the next thing, the inboxes are gonna be inundated because someone didn't add the statement or.

403
00:43:19,229 --> 00:43:21,531
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can appreciate that.

404
00:43:22,052 --> 00:43:22,332
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

405
00:43:22,912 --> 00:43:24,854
[SPEAKER_04]: I can appreciate that superintendent to have a rollout.

406
00:43:25,422 --> 00:43:41,250
[SPEAKER_04]: In September and I appreciate you being thoughtful about the process because we don't want to just sort of throw the process together I agree right we want to make sure that people are prepared and whether it's the assistant principals that are where the 504 coordinator in the building that has taken the request or, you know, direct.

407
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:44,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Joan Bowen's office, I think that's true.

408
00:43:44,292 --> 00:43:45,493
[SPEAKER_04]: There are things that need to be done.

409
00:43:45,993 --> 00:43:49,956
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, to be clear, we know that this is already supposed to be happening, right?

410
00:43:50,036 --> 00:43:53,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Like this is already, if a parent makes it, and I know that Ms.

411
00:43:53,099 --> 00:43:58,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Bowen knows this, and I just want to make sure that others who are watching know this, especially parents, right?

412
00:43:58,863 --> 00:44:08,431
[SPEAKER_04]: This is already supposed to be happening, but for us to be thoughtful about it and to be recognizing it as a value statement, I appreciate you saying that, Superintendent, because

413
00:44:08,971 --> 00:44:14,915
[SPEAKER_04]: it's not only a requirement in the law, it is also a value statement to put it forward facing and to actually do it.

414
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:19,198
[SPEAKER_04]: So I very much appreciate you saying that and doing it thoughtfully, I think is really important.

415
00:44:19,738 --> 00:44:23,061
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, I would be perfectly fine with that.

416
00:44:23,121 --> 00:44:32,767
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sure that CPAC, which is their role, is available to advise the district at any time about sort of what that can look like moving forward.

417
00:44:32,807 --> 00:44:34,629
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not necessarily saying that it needs to go on

418
00:44:35,795 --> 00:44:42,120
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm only one member of this subcommittee and also one member of the school committee and a member of the community.

419
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:47,304
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not saying that it needs to go on every single bit of communication.

420
00:44:47,565 --> 00:44:49,366
[SPEAKER_04]: That's up to other folks to decide.

421
00:44:49,406 --> 00:44:54,390
[SPEAKER_04]: But I would say that anything that is related to the life of the school, it should be on.

422
00:44:54,850 --> 00:45:02,617
[SPEAKER_04]: So any after school enrichment, sort of field trip, those sorts of things, I think it should be on.

423
00:45:02,657 --> 00:45:04,318
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was something that I would definitely

424
00:45:05,988 --> 00:45:15,253
[SPEAKER_04]: But we do have, I definitely think it should be more, it is in some ways, not in some ways, it is on our website.

425
00:45:15,433 --> 00:45:19,216
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a version of a non-discrimination agreement on our website.

426
00:45:19,236 --> 00:45:21,217
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll tell you right now, it's really hard to find.

427
00:45:22,218 --> 00:45:24,039
[SPEAKER_04]: It's embedded in a number of different places.

428
00:45:24,099 --> 00:45:26,020
[SPEAKER_04]: I do think that it should be a little bit clearer.

429
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:29,002
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, we have a family and community engagement subcommittee meeting.

430
00:45:29,522 --> 00:45:47,123
[SPEAKER_04]: coming up to and working with the new with the people who have been so great and excuse me and preparing the website that we can sort of talk more about where that can can go but we right currently right now we have it embedded in the school committee policy that you know is people might not necessarily go to it's a little dry.

431
00:45:47,964 --> 00:45:53,408
[SPEAKER_04]: We have it on the school lunch page that I can see.

432
00:45:53,928 --> 00:46:01,533
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I think we have it as a link under the 504 coordinator.

433
00:46:01,593 --> 00:46:07,817
[SPEAKER_04]: But actually, some of that information is dated, as I just showed you, with the out-of-date contacts and what have you.

434
00:46:08,437 --> 00:46:16,323
[SPEAKER_04]: But yes, I think that it is mindful to do that on a September rollout for the particular text, but obviously not the practice.

435
00:46:18,184 --> 00:46:21,568
[SPEAKER_04]: if you end up, if you follow Dr. Vincent, what I'm saying.

436
00:46:22,609 --> 00:46:22,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

437
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:24,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

438
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:24,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Shanine.

439
00:46:24,911 --> 00:46:27,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

440
00:46:29,136 --> 00:46:40,267
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess I'm all behind a non-discrimination policy, but if the process to get accommodations isn't clear or hasn't been documented then, and there's no

441
00:46:41,085 --> 00:46:55,595
[SPEAKER_02]: policies and procedures that are ADA and IDEA compliant, then it doesn't matter how much we say that we believe in it if there's no way for people to get there and to show that the school district is not compliant in whatever process.

442
00:46:55,975 --> 00:47:02,920
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess I just want to make sure that you're saying you're going to back this up with policy immediately and not just put this statement out and make us feel good.

443
00:47:04,781 --> 00:47:06,062
[SPEAKER_02]: And what does it mean additionally

444
00:47:06,759 --> 00:47:09,163
[SPEAKER_02]: What does it mean to have an event be accessible when you say that?

445
00:47:09,263 --> 00:47:10,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Where is that going to be documented?

446
00:47:11,287 --> 00:47:16,677
[SPEAKER_02]: The kinds of things that are mandated to be in place to have an event be accessible.

447
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:28,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think we're sort of one step at a time in it right now to make sure that we're, you know, really sort of letting families and others know that, you know, this is obviously like we said, something that should be being done regardless.

448
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,842
[SPEAKER_04]: But right, I think it's a learning process.

449
00:47:31,323 --> 00:47:33,705
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's been 30 years since the ADA was passed.

450
00:47:33,745 --> 00:47:35,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Why isn't this in place already?

451
00:47:35,366 --> 00:47:36,367
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, right?

452
00:47:37,388 --> 00:47:37,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Cut it.

453
00:47:38,169 --> 00:47:41,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Shanine, you're preaching to the choir here, my friend.

454
00:47:41,171 --> 00:47:47,496
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just saying, you know, we're hoping to like, we're hoping to screen, you know, Crip Camp, you know, next October too.

455
00:47:47,536 --> 00:47:52,641
[SPEAKER_04]: We're hoping to have some other events so people understand this and, you know, the pioneer Judy Heumann who

456
00:47:53,401 --> 00:48:12,545
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, was really a part of the movement to get the ADA passed used to say this all the time I mean we see this it's not exclusive to Medford, by the way, this is, you know, something that happens in a lot of places that people are not necessarily accommodating and unfortunately a lot of times it takes, you know, parents and others to have to, you know, create

457
00:48:14,085 --> 00:48:18,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Situations that make relationships sort of deteriorate in some cases.

458
00:48:18,548 --> 00:48:29,934
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I'm trying to do, and what I hope the subcommittee and others are trying to do really is to figure out how to build relationships and work together to make sure that people are understanding that this is a requirement.

459
00:48:30,955 --> 00:48:32,516
[SPEAKER_04]: It should be part of policy for sure.

460
00:48:32,536 --> 00:48:35,278
[SPEAKER_04]: And also how do we get the information out?

461
00:48:35,298 --> 00:48:41,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the truth is people can also do the bare minimum and not really want to be meaningful about it.

462
00:48:42,083 --> 00:48:46,747
[SPEAKER_04]: So I appreciate that there's some meaningful, and I don't know the answer to that question necessarily, Shanine.

463
00:48:46,767 --> 00:48:55,133
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we all don't, we're sort of working and figuring that out, but I think I'm encouraged by us all being here and wanting to work that out together.

464
00:48:55,273 --> 00:48:57,455
[SPEAKER_04]: So I appreciate your comment, Alex.

465
00:49:00,323 --> 00:49:19,346
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so I wanted to say that, I mean, the needs are very different and the experiences are very different, but in our experience, the school has been very accommodating once we contacted them and tell them, you know, my kid wants to participate and they really made it work.

466
00:49:20,006 --> 00:49:29,568
[SPEAKER_08]: So our concern was that a lot of parents and families are self-excluding because the language was not such that

467
00:49:30,263 --> 00:49:43,120
[SPEAKER_08]: It's welcoming, you know, and I'm like I don't want this burden I, I don't want this to be another fight so I'm just kind of protecting myself as a parent, who's already fighting for other things and I'm not even going there.

468
00:49:46,628 --> 00:49:52,553
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, this is what I want to say, that our experience has been positive once we contacted people.

469
00:49:53,014 --> 00:50:00,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and I would agree for the most part, although except for when there are people who don't understand, right, who don't have the information.

470
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:09,308
[SPEAKER_04]: So it has been, I would agree that it has been really, the district has been really responsive about accommodations and a number of

471
00:50:09,908 --> 00:50:30,926
[SPEAKER_04]: instances, but I would also say I've talked to families who have had experience with people who don't realize that that's the requirement and or families who don't want to ask your right because it feels like their child's a burden or it feels like they don't want to have to go through the process because it can be hard for them.

472
00:50:31,466 --> 00:50:36,452
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that that's a point and that's where I think the superintendent was talking about the value statement.

473
00:50:36,872 --> 00:50:47,844
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's also a value statement right it's also talking about, you know, what equity means right we're talking about equity being at the forefront for our district and so you know this is an example of.

474
00:50:48,465 --> 00:50:52,310
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, also being equitable and being proactive and building relationships, I think.

475
00:50:52,350 --> 00:50:53,512
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that's a really good point.

476
00:50:54,393 --> 00:51:04,586
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess I would like to make a motion that we include this item here in blue.

477
00:51:05,362 --> 00:51:07,723
[SPEAKER_04]: as, oops, sorry, I didn't mean to do that.

478
00:51:08,463 --> 00:51:31,534
[SPEAKER_04]: This item here in blue as a suggestion for accommodation, you know, statement, inclusion statement to accompany policy and practice in Medford Public Schools as a recommendation to the whole committee at our next meeting.

479
00:51:33,455 --> 00:51:34,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Are folks comfortable?

480
00:51:35,837 --> 00:51:37,760
[SPEAKER_04]: With that statement, if so, I would need a second.

481
00:51:38,681 --> 00:51:39,442
[SPEAKER_06]: Second, Melanie.

482
00:51:41,125 --> 00:51:42,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Member Mastone.

483
00:51:44,289 --> 00:51:44,990
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll do the roll.

484
00:51:45,511 --> 00:51:47,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Member McLaughlin, yes.

485
00:51:47,714 --> 00:51:48,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Mastone?

486
00:51:49,036 --> 00:51:49,256
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

487
00:51:50,097 --> 00:51:50,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Rousseau?

488
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:51,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

489
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:53,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

490
00:51:53,656 --> 00:51:57,620
[SPEAKER_04]: We have three yes and no, no.

491
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:05,389
[SPEAKER_04]: So we will move this forward at the next school committee meeting, which is, I know we have cows next week, the eighth.

492
00:52:05,430 --> 00:52:06,831
[SPEAKER_04]: So the next one is the 15th, is it?

493
00:52:09,121 --> 00:52:09,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

494
00:52:09,541 --> 00:52:10,302
[SPEAKER_04]: The 15th, right?

495
00:52:10,762 --> 00:52:14,243
[SPEAKER_04]: So this will be on the agenda.

496
00:52:14,303 --> 00:52:14,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sorry.

497
00:52:14,923 --> 00:52:16,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Russo has his hand raised.

498
00:52:16,784 --> 00:52:17,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Russo?

499
00:52:17,444 --> 00:52:17,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

500
00:52:18,845 --> 00:52:35,292
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, when we make this recommendation, we need to be pretty precise and say, like, the motion is, the recommendation is to amend, you know, policy AC non-discrimination and add this as item number

501
00:52:36,428 --> 00:52:37,109
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it is.

502
00:52:37,169 --> 00:52:38,269
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't see it on the screen.

503
00:52:39,430 --> 00:52:44,473
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to be that precise so that the committee can vote, make it number six.

504
00:52:46,094 --> 00:52:52,758
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have to re-vote or anything, but we just can't have that text sitting there.

505
00:52:52,778 --> 00:52:53,438
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand.

506
00:52:53,538 --> 00:52:54,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Member Russo.

507
00:52:55,399 --> 00:52:56,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

508
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,141
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand and I appreciate that.

509
00:52:58,401 --> 00:53:00,102
[SPEAKER_04]: It will be a well-written motion.

510
00:53:02,224 --> 00:53:02,984
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate it.

511
00:53:05,253 --> 00:53:05,894
[SPEAKER_04]: anyone else?

512
00:53:06,014 --> 00:53:07,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other questions or comments?

513
00:53:10,958 --> 00:53:11,798
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm seeing none.

514
00:53:11,898 --> 00:53:17,123
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just want to note for the record that we are six minutes events of schedule.

515
00:53:17,303 --> 00:53:21,086
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, you know, motion to adjourn.

516
00:53:21,406 --> 00:53:22,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, there you go.

517
00:53:22,187 --> 00:53:23,208
