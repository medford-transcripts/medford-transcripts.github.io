    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=36.17s">In</a>  the minutes we talked about our having I believe a committee of the whole I don't know if it's in the minutes on health and I was wondering if the committee wanted to go to Zumba before we have that committee meeting and just get a little workout and get our blood flowing I was at Zumba up the high school and I spoke the instructor and she'd be she'd love to have us all so <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=61.028s">When</a>  we schedule that, if we want to do that, I thought it would be, since it's about health and movement, it would be a fun way for us to all have a good time together and then sit and talk about the health of our students.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=74.857s">Is</a>  there a second on the floor? <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=77.219s">Seconded</a>  by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=77.919s">Kreatz.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=78.52s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=79.24s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=80.081s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=81.421s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=82.882s">Approval</a>  of bills, transfer of funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=87.085s">Motion</a>  on the floor by Mr. Russo, seconded by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=89.306s">Kreatz.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=92.343s">Roll</a>  call vote, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=93.724s">Mayor</a>  Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=94.645s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=95.626s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=96.046s">I</a>  had some questions regarding the bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=99.169s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=99.409s">Patterson.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=120.598s">Yes,</a>  so that's food for the inmates while they are doing work within the buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=125.781s">That</a>  makes sense.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=126.562s">When</a>  I was reading it over the weekend, I'm like, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=131.445s">Yeah,</a>  that's great if that's how we're paying for building repairs and upgrades. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=144.295s">It</a>  lines down, it says professional technical services education and it lists a Mr. Lino. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=152.821s">I</a>  keep seeing his name throughout the... Yes, it's the evening school.</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=158.765s">He</a>  provides training for the evening school program.</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=190.074s">I</a>  don't know if it's college. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=190.874s">Yes,</a>  that's tuition for special education services under Circuit Breaker. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=196.859s">Oh,</a>  OK.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=198.421s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=199.802s">And</a>  then. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=204.639s">I</a>  believe that's all of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=206.2s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=255.566s">I</a>  left out the names. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=256.626s">So</a>  I just want to go through the names again. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=260.229s">I</a>  want to thank the City Hall, the Finance and Auditing Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=263.972s">I</a>  also want to thank the Griffin High School, Accounts and Payroll and Valuation Department, and the JoJo Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=270.897s">And</a>  I want to give a special thanks to Kelly Cavanaugh, Cynthia Byrne, Juwanda McGraw, Michelle Kagan,</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=286.077s">Motion</a>  to place this report on file by Mr. Kreatz, seconded by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=293.899s">DiBenedetto.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=295.0s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=295.6s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=296.42s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=297.08s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=299.481s">Report</a>  of committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=300.441s">Support</a>  Services Subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=302.141s">It's</a>  the Medication Administration Policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=304.582s">Mr.</a>  Russo, chair of that committee.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=312.285s">So</a>  the Support Services Subcommittee met in August of last year, which I recommend in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=317.989s">It</a>  was very, very hot. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=321.032s">Very</a>  hot. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=321.532s">Sorry</a>  about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=322.773s">And</a>  we met to update the medication administration policy for the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=327.877s">It</a>  had needed a lot of updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=331.58s">And</a>  the Support Services Subcommittee met just before this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=339.791s">Most</a>  approved the policy to come before the full committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=344.335s">There</a>  were some clarifications around busing, situations when nursing was not available, and self-administration changes were made to the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=355.303s">And</a>  that is about it.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=357.585s">Very</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=359.146s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=359.986s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=361.408s">I</a>  read through the policies, and I really like a lot of the updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=365.21s">There</a>  is something that I came across with a parent <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=369.414s">recently</a>  that I'd like to see added, and that is a school nurse may not consult with the student's physician and get medication orders without parental permission.</p>

    <p>[Toni Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=384.619s">So</a>  let me clarify that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=386.839s">Following</a>  the Department of Public Health regulations, when nurses are administering medications, it is within the Board of Registration and Nursing guidelines that we have access to physicians to clarify <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=398.77s">I'm</a>  not aware of any medication orders.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=400.531s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=400.771s">Clarification</a>  is one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=402.712s">Getting</a>  a different order from a doctor without a parent being notified is a major issue that I feel that this needs to be added, that parental permission for any, you know, changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=419.599s">Like</a>  a nurse is calling a pediatrician. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=422.841s">Getting</a>  a change in a child's medication order or <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=428.55s">And</a>  not notifying a parent is not appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=432.313s">And</a>  so therefore, I want to make sure parental notification is either given prior to that phone call or after that phone call that an order has been changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=443.681s">Because</a>  in this situation, the parent was never notified of the change from her child's physician to the school.</p>

    <p>[Toni Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=453.028s">I</a>  think probably you and I should talk about that situation in private.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=455.13s">No,</a>  I think it should be a policy on this document. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=458.396s">And</a>  I don't think it's a conversation privately. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=460.697s">It</a>  should never have happened to any parent to find out in a meeting in that it should be part of this policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=467.038s">And</a>  there is a motion on the floor.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=468.358s">What</a>  section are you amending?</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=471.319s">Under</a>  Medication Orders, Parental Consent. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=479.341s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Toni Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=482.932s">What</a>  page is that in?</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=484.574s">It's</a>  the first page of the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=486.415s">It</a>  starts on the first page.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=488.137s">Page</a>  one.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=489.818s">And</a>  then which one are you? <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=493.642s">Item</a>  two says a school nurse shall ensure that there is written authorization by the parent or guardian.</p>

    <p>[Toni Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=499.627s">So</a>  that's a consent form.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=501.088s">A</a>  consent to administer medication, but not to call. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=505.592s">Yeah,</a>  to administer it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=507.054s">But</a>  this particular situation was <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=510.138s">the</a>  nurse called the doctor, the order was changed after that conversation and the parent was never notified that they called the doctor or that an order was changed and the parent got no notification. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=524.627s">So</a>  I want that addressed in this policy since we're reviewing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=529.049s">I</a>  don't think that any parent would want the school nurse to change their child's orders with their doctor and not be notified.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=536.654s">Is</a>  that customary?</p>

    <p>[Toni Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=540.044s">It's</a>  customary to call the physicians for clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=544.846s">But</a>  there was a change, and the parent wasn't notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=549.748s">I</a>  don't think this is the place for us to discuss this.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=553.609s">Oh,</a>  it absolutely is, because we're talking about policy changes in this department at this meeting, and that's something that I had firsthand knowledge of happening, and it should be addressed in these policies.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=570.473s">thing</a>  would be for us to bring it back to the subcommittee and address it in subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=574.9s">So</a>  motioned.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=577.243s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=577.484s">Van</a>  der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=578.705s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=579.316s">Would</a>  it make sense, since we have the rest of the policy here, to go ahead with the approval so everything else is updated and... I'd rather this... This is such an important issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=591.466s">I</a>  do have respect for... We have a meeting next week.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=595.149s">Maybe</a>  we can bring it back next week so that it's not... Are you making a motion to send this back to the subcommittee for further deliberation?</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=607.04s">Actually,</a>  I'm asking to amend the policy and add that a school nurse may not consult with the student's physician and get medication orders or changes without parental permission.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=619.587s">Where</a>  do you want that?</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=620.667s">I</a>  want that in section E. Section what? <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=623.869s">E.</a> </p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=625.23s">E.</a>  I feel it should go back to subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=628.904s">There's</a>  a motion on the floor to add it.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=630.244s">There's</a>  a motion on the floor to amend it under section E. We're in section E. We need to be specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=636.286s">This</a>  is a policy, so it has to be specific.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=643.008s">Mayor</a>  Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=643.508s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=643.588s">Van</a>  der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=644.429s">Erin,</a>  I understand your concern and the importance of what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=648.69s">I</a>  have some questions about how it should be worded correctly, because there's also an obligation by the physician as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=656.4s">So</a>  to just put all the onus on how we write it has to include both parties. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=663.327s">And</a>  so I'm reluctant to all of a sudden just put a sentence in here and say we're going to approve it tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=669.413s">I'm</a>  hearing your concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=671.295s">I</a>  understand there was an issue that I know nothing about. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=674.698s">but</a>  I'm asking that we would give us an opportunity, you know, we could perhaps do it at the beginning of our next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=683.863s">We</a>  could also have a subcommittee meeting, so we could bring it back next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=686.785s">Wouldn't</a>  it be a long time frame? <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=689.146s">Would</a>  that be acceptable?</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=690.487s">I</a>  remove my amendment and again ask it to go to subcommittee, so that way the wording is correct.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=697.39s">So</a>  you're asking to send this back to subcommittee?</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=700.252s">Right,</a>  but I don't want the document <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=702.638s">approved</a>  until this issue is. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=704.338s">Fine.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=704.899s">So.</a> </p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=705.099s">It's</a>  a motion on the floor to send this to subcommittee.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=708.099s">Second</a>  it with the added.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=709.2s">Second</a>  it.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=710.68s">We</a>  do not have anything before our meeting next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=713.961s">Is</a>  that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=714.561s">We</a>  have.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=714.961s">The</a>  chair of the subcommittee would call the meeting.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=717.222s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=717.522s">Next</a>  week's meeting, we do have committee of the whole at 615. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=722.303s">And</a>  then we will also have executive session on Monday the 11th.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=726.384s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=726.704s">So</a>  we have to figure out when we can do that.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=728.264s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=728.684s">Anyway,</a>  we'll do it as quickly as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=730.485s">Mr.</a>  Russo.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=731.427s">I</a>  just have a question about this policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=733.649s">And</a>  unlike other policies, we don't just approve the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=737.292s">The</a>  school physician actually has to approve it as well.</p>

    <p>[Toni Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=739.555s">The</a>  school physician signs off on it, along with myself and the superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=744.659s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=745.02s">So</a>  I mean, that's why I think that moving it to subcommittee also makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=748.643s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Toni Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=749.244s">So</a>  if we have a date for that, then when we do, yes, then I'll invite Dr. Sabia to join us.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=756.102s">Okay,</a>  there's a motion on the floor to move this paper to subcommittee, seconded by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=759.723s">Van</a>  der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=760.743s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=761.523s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=762.463s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=763.544s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=766.124s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=768.365s">A</a>  motion for suspension of the rules, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=770.065s">Van</a>  der Kloot?</p>

    <p>[Diane Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=794.23s">Good</a>  evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=796.625s">So</a>  Project 351 is an independent nonprofit organization that builds a movement of youth-led service by engaging unsung heroes from each of the Massachusetts 351 cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=811.429s">United</a>  for a year of leadership and service, ambassadors transform communities, elevate kindness, advance social justice, and gain courage, compassion, and capabilities to lead change. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=825.473s">This</a>  was founded by Governor Deval Patrick in 2011 and now convened by Governor Charlie Baker. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=831.575s">Project</a>  351 fosters unity and strengthens the ethic of service to the engagement and enrichment of 8th grade ambassadors from each of the cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=844.775s">As</a>  a member of 351, ambassadors represent their family, school, and community with honor, humility, and pride. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=853.243s">Over</a>  a year's term, they engage with a community of peers, team-based service projects, and leadership development opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=862.761s">respect,</a>  a cooperative spirit, and fun are hallmarks of successful ambassador teams. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=870.224s">Ambassadors</a>  are expected to do their best as a member of 351. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=874.426s">They</a>  are encouraged to use the service and leadership skills they develop to address important issues facing their local communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=884.685s">A</a>  representative from the Andrews and McGlynn's Middle School participated in this event the weekend of January 19th. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=891.887s">I've</a>  asked these students to tell you a little bit of what they've learned and what they will do moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=898.388s">At</a>  this time, I'd like to invite Principal Nick Tucci up with his guest, Margaret Hines, to talk a little bit about Project 351, and then Michael Downs, the principal of the Andrews School, to come up as well.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=912.572s">Mr.</a>  Tucci? <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=913.892s">Welcome.</a> </p>

    <p>[Nick Tucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=915.132s">Good</a>  evening, everyone.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=916.393s">Good</a>  evening.</p>

    <p>[Nick Tucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=919.494s">Good</a>  evening, Medford School Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=921.195s">It's</a>  my pleasure to be here tonight to speak with you about the involvement of two of our middle school students in Medford who participated in last month's Project 351 launch day on Saturday, January 19th in Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=935.994s">8th</a>  grade McGlynn Middle School student, Margaret Hines, and 8th grade Andrews Middle School student, Vishal Romero, were nominated by their teachers and selected by their school principal to represent our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=947.916s">These</a>  8th grade students who represented Medford were chosen on the basis of Project 351's core values of their ambassadors, which are kindness, compassion, humility, and gratitude. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=960.779s">According</a>  to Project 351's mission, <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=963.212s">They</a>  seek to develop the next generation of community-first service leaders through customized service learning, hands-on community building, and values-based leadership training. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=974.361s">Both</a>  Margaret and Vishal had wonderful experiences on launch day at Faneuil Hall in Boston, where they got a chance to hear Governor Baker address the young leaders, perform acts of kindness in their community, and engage in leadership activities that will be a lifetime experience for them all. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=991.634s">They</a>  had the opportunity to develop their leadership skills to one day uplift, unite, and transform the communities in which they live. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=999.841s">We</a>  look forward to supporting their leadership project this year through their clubs within the schools, such as the Student Council and the CCSR, Census for Citizenship and Social Responsibility, where they can carry through with their projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1012.191s">At</a>  this point in time, I'd love to turn it over to the McGlynn Middle School representative, Margaret Hines.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1024.38s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1024.9s">And</a>  my name is Margaret Hines, as you just heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1027.221s">And</a>  I'm the eighth grade representative for the McGlynn Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1030.302s">And</a>  I wrote a reflection that I would like to share with you here today on my experience at launch day of Project 351. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1037.345s">So</a>  Project 351 had actually never been on my radar until I was asked to participate in December of 2018 by my principal, Mr. Tucci. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1046.588s">As</a>  an eighth grade student going into a day-long community service project on the weekend that I'd never heard before, I didn't know what to expect at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1054.532s">At</a>  the time, I had no inclination that I would have such a wonderful and amazing experience at Project 351, nor did I have any idea that I would find a whole community of people who all are devoted to creating a better world. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1067.078s">My</a>  day at Project 351 was full of incredible opportunities and phenomenal people, and I'm glad to say that this first meeting is only the start of a remarkable year of service to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1077.762s">The</a>  day I spent at Project 351 <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1079.956s">was</a>  a great blend of hearing from community leaders, meeting other eighth graders from across the state of Massachusetts, and taking action through community service. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1089.2s">The</a>  morning was kicked off at 8 when we all boarded our regional buses to Faneuil Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1093.982s">On</a>  the bus, the alumni of Project 351 answered some of our initial questions and played some ice breakers with all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1101.266s">This</a>  first bus ride of the day was when I realized that everyone here was willing and open to starting a conversation to find out more about who everyone else was. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1109.51s">and</a>  is. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1110.711s">Therefore,</a>  there is something to be said about the beauty of a place where everyone else you meet is new, and everyone else they meet is new. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1118.035s">And</a>  there's no way to be clicky or awkward about it, because you're all just saying hi to each other, and you're all in the exact same position. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1125.5s">After</a>  our regional buses dropped us off at Faneuil Hall, we all found our service hero groups, each named after someone who had contributed to making the world a better place all their life. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1135.059s">After</a>  learning about our service heroes and meeting with our teams, the leaders of Project 351 explained how the day was going to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1142.205s">And</a>  our Massachusetts community leaders came to speak about their experiences with service and leading in the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1147.929s">Leaders</a>  such as Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, news anchor Lisa Hughes, and Governor Charlie Baker all shared their experiences with us and talked about how community service has the power to impact the lives of all people, whether you're the one doing the service or on the receiving end of the benefits. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1165.367s">Once</a>  these leaders were done sharing their stories and advice, we all headed out to do some community service of our own. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1170.911s">My</a>  team went to a school in the Boston area and collaborated with a group called Service Village and the Martin Richard Foundation to create packages of books for underprivileged children and Valentine's Day cards for veterans. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1181.64s">Since</a>  there were over 351 of us, not all groups went to the same places. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1185.983s">Some</a>  of us went to work with an organization called Cradles to Crowns. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1191.628s">And</a>  some of us went to paint the inside of an old preschool. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1195.243s">While</a>  at the service sites, we had more time to talk to each other and learn more about where everyone else was from and learn more about how we as a state can come together to create positive change. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1205.686s">Being</a>  an eighth grader who lives in Medford and has never lived anywhere else, it can be easy to forget that Massachusetts is a really big place. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1213.588s">And</a>  there are lots of places in Massachusetts with lots and lots of people, who, surprise, are also from Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1221.13s">In</a>  the afternoon, <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1224.191s">Around</a>  3, we all piled back onto our buses and headed back to Faneuil Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1228.735s">For</a>  the last few hours of the day, we shared our experiences at our different service sites, talked about what we learned, continued to meet even more new people, there were a lot of us, and even filmed a good luck message for the Patriots. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1241.487s">By</a>  the end of the day, we were all exhausted in the best way and happy to go home. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1249.077s">One</a>  of the messages of Project 351 taught me was to not hesitate to start making change in my community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1256.46s">Project</a>  351's motto of Unite, Act, Lead is a perfect summary of how this may be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1262.023s">The</a>  first step in any movement for change is to unite, to bring together your community around one shared goal and to make sure everyone is heard in uniting towards this goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1272.827s">The</a>  second step is to act. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1274.598s">Acting</a>  can mean many things. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1275.919s">It</a>  can mean to have one large change come over a community at once, or it can mean to bring change through small steps, eventually leading up to a larger picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1285.727s">Either</a>  way, the ability to act also means there must be an ability to lead. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1289.39s">In</a>  leading, you are bringing the circle to a full close and allowing positive change to happen and continue happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1295.995s">The</a>  main question brought about in my time at Project 351 was, how can I bring these changes to my community? <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1303.04s">And</a>  well, the answer isn't simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1305.241s">Everyone</a>  has a different town, school, family, city, you name it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1309.044s">It</a>  would be impossible to come up with a one-size-fits-all formula to apply to any community situation, which is why it is important to put basic principles in place, principles such as the ones given by Project 351's message of Unite, Act, Lead. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1323.209s">In</a>  bringing these founding principles to our Medford community, we would be able to accomplish so much more and be able to inspire so many more young people to come forward and lead positive change. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1332.713s">In</a>  many situations, communities are improved by just allowing for a safe place for discussions about change to grow. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1338.796s">We</a>  don't even have to know what those discussions might be as long as we're open to hearing about them. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1343.797s">Change</a>  that comes in leaps and bounds doesn't often knock on the door until later in the conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1348.279s">So</a>  if we're aiming to create a community in which we work our hardest to take action, we must first realize that the only way to continue in unity is to listen to the ideas and opinions of our peers. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1357.962s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1358.603s">Very</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[Nick Tucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1367.286s">Thank</a>  you, Margaret. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1367.926s">It's</a>  now my pleasure to turn it over to Mr. Downs, principal of the Andrews Middle School and Vishal Romero.</p>

    <p>[ih84fneWXk0_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1379.558s">Good</a>  evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1380.979s">With</a>  not much of a do, I would like to introduce Vishal Romero. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1384.281s">But</a>  I would like to publicly thank one teacher in particular, and that would be Mr. Ian Levine, a social studies teacher on my AB side, along with several teachers who recommended Vishal. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1395.529s">He</a>  stood out by writing a very nice and long recommendation for Vishal. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1400.752s">So</a>  with him, I would like to give him some public credit for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1403.654s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1404.054s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1411.105s">When</a>  Principal Downs asked me about Project 351, I had not heard of it before. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1415.888s">Soon,</a>  however, I was fully registered for launch day. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1419.35s">The</a>  coordinators kept in contact with myself and all of my fellow ambassadors, and after several informative emails and one conference call, I was ready for the big day. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1428.535s">I</a>  woke up early on the 19th and went to the centralized bus stop that had been assigned to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1433.438s">There,</a>  we were picked up by a regional bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1436.417s">When</a>  we reached Boston, the almost 400 ambassadors from all 351 towns and cities in Massachusetts gathered in Faneuil Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1444.701s">There,</a>  for the launch of our day, we listened to several speeches from people like Governor Charlie Baker, First Lady Lauren Baker, and Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, among others. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1454.965s">After</a>  the ceremony, the ambassadors split up into large groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1458.647s">Each</a>  set of service hero groups are smaller organizational groups, <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1462.593s">left</a>  to go to one of the service sites. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1464.934s">I</a>  went to the McKay School, where some service hero groups painted murals and others packaged thank you care packages for the staff of the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1472.977s">Other</a>  groups in different service sites helped with other projects, such as packaging food for the Greater Boston Food Bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1480.18s">We</a>  spent two hours of our day working on these community service projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1484.341s">We</a>  reconvened later at Faneuil Hall, as we could not go to the Kennedy Library due to the government shutdown. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1490.353s">We</a>  talked about our day of service, and ambassadors from every service site spoke about what was accomplished. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1496.155s">The</a>  regional buses then arrived, picked up their assigned students, and departed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1501.356s">Launch</a>  Day was a chance for myself and all of the other ambassadors to meet people from all over the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1507.678s">This</a>  means that we build connections from as far away as the Berkshires. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1511.539s">We</a>  can use these connections for advice from our peers. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1514.82s">Launch</a>  Day also gives those in our communities opportunities for service. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1519.263s">In</a>  the Spring Service Project 351, we will donate to Cradles to Crayons, an organization that provides everyday necessities to children. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1529.489s">Students</a>  in the Andrews Middle School and the McGlynn Middle School that are members of the National Junior Honor Society or else participate in clubs like the CCSR can participate in this spring project. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1540.415s">Anyone</a>  can serve. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1541.716s">We</a>  are just ambassadors.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1553.607s">So</a>  impressed, are we not? <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1555.548s">Very,</a>  very impressed with both of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1557.388s">Amazing</a>  delivery. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1559.829s">And</a>  I'm sure you learned a lot that day. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1562.17s">Take</a>  it home and continue to be an ambassador in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1565.591s">We</a>  look forward to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1568.572s">Is</a>  there a motion on the floor to accept this report and place it on file? <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1571.853s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1572.093s">Mustone,</a>  seconded by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1573.814s">Vandeclude.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1574.454s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1575.814s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1577.155s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1578.935s">The</a>  next item up is the report on Judge Klein's visit to our schools by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1582.817s">Caldwell.</a> </p>

    <p>[Diane Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1586.642s">Judge</a>  Sandra R. Kline, a federal bankruptcy court judge from Los Angeles, California, visited our grade 5 elementary and grade 8 students' girls on January 22nd and January 24th. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1602.108s">Judge</a>  Kline serves as a United States bankruptcy judge for the Central District of California. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1608.91s">She</a>  has been committed to public service with a focus on educating, mentoring, and giving back to her community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1616.469s">Originally</a>  from Medford, Judge Klein attended the Gleason, Hobbs, and Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1621.713s">Her</a>  mom and dad still live here in Medford by Playstead Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1626.057s">A</a>  quick hello to them, they're watching tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1629.579s">The</a>  purpose of Judge Klein's visit was to empower and instill confidence in our girls. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1634.884s">She</a>  wanted them to know that they can do anything they want to if they work and study hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1640.827s">Judge</a>  Klein gave a brief summary of her background and explained different challenges that she had and how she overcame these challenges. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1649.931s">She</a>  wanted the students to think if she can do it, they can do it as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1655.313s">Judge</a>  Klein discussed going to school at UMass Lowell for music education <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1660.453s">and</a>  then deciding to change her career and apply it to law school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1665.137s">Her</a>  mom said to her, you know, I'm not sure you want to be a music education teacher, but you argue with me on a regular basis, so maybe you should go into law. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1675.728s">She</a>  wanted the students to know that life does not always go as planned. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1679.69s">Sometimes</a>  there are roadblocks or setbacks, but if you persevere, you can accomplish your goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1686.853s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1687.093s">Klein</a>  told the students to volunteer and not hold back. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1690.635s">She</a>  also stated, it is better to try and fail than to never have tried at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1696.778s">Always</a>  put your best foot forward and try to be prepared for what comes your way. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1701.769s">She</a>  encouraged the girls to be kind, to hold a door for someone, greet people with a smile. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1707.332s">It</a>  could make a difference in someone's life. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1710.753s">One</a>  of the most important statements made by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1712.955s">Klein</a>  was to never give up. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1715.196s">Sometimes</a>  there are obstacles in your life, but keep focused and move forward towards your dreams. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1720.958s">The</a>  girls asked pertinent questions about what it's like to be a judge, what led her to California, <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1726.42s">and</a>  about her judicial responsibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1729.402s">The</a>  presentation also instilled confidence and a sense of self-control in our girls. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1735.485s">I</a>  would like to just read to you a few of the things that the students wrote to Judge Klein. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1741.549s">I</a>  left you with the biography as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1745.486s">Baraket</a>  Rumacab of the Andrews Middle School wanted you to know that it shouldn't matter, that Judge Klein said, it shouldn't matter what you have been through. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1754.953s">What</a>  matters is how hard you work to achieve your dream and change your life for the better. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1761.578s">She</a>  just thought that Judge Klein was an amazing woman, an amazing role model for her. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1768.223s">This</a>  was the grade 8 Andrews School. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1771.46s">We</a>  also had a fifth grade student at the Columbus School that wrote a letter to Judge Klein that said, thank you for taking time out of your day to visit the Columbus Elementary School. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1783.505s">We</a>  appreciate the talk that you had with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1786.387s">One</a>  thing I know that will stay with me is when you said that girls can do whatever boys can. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1792.011s">That</a>  inspired me to do any job I want to do, and I learned that there is no specific job for one gender. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1799.377s">You</a>  were an inspiration to me and others. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1802.239s">Keep</a>  doing what you're doing because it is amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1807.345s">One</a>  of the students from the Roberts Elementary School had a question for Judge Klein, which was, if you could change a law, what would it be? <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1816.553s">And</a>  Judge Klein thought about it, and she said, you know, I have to think about that for a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1821.037s">And</a>  just the other day, she sent me an email, and she said, please forward this to the student. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1826.882s">what</a>  I would do is make it a law that you can never do a government shutdown again. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1834.805s">Because</a>  it really impacted. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1836.146s">And</a>  when I listened to Vishal just talk to us about how we couldn't go to the JFK Library, that made me think of Judge Klein. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1844.91s">And</a>  at this time, I am very, very proud to introduce to you a student from the Roberts Elementary School. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1853.073s">Her</a>  name is Angela Aurelian. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1855.99s">She</a>  came to Medford from Haiti in September of 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1858.931s">That's</a>  just a little bit ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1862.392s">She</a>  is in the fifth grade newcomers class at the Roberts Elementary School. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1867.813s">She</a>  speaks French, Creole, English, and a little bit of Spanish. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1873.354s">I</a>  am very proud to have her teacher with us, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1876.335s">Christine</a>  Hingston, thank you so much, and our director of EL, I noticed that Paul Texera, <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1882.18s">was</a>  here as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1883.061s">Thank</a>  you so much for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1885.163s">So</a>  at this time I'm going to let Angela tell you what she thought as well.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1893.47s">My</a>  name is Angela Aurelian. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1896.213s">I</a>  am a fifth grade student from the Robert School. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1900.257s">I</a>  was lucky to hear Judge DeCline speaking with all the fifth grade girls. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1906.713s">That</a>  was the first time I saw a judge in real life. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1911.014s">I</a>  was excited and nervous, but it was fun to listen to a judge. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1916.896s">I</a>  learned that sometimes when you get a job, there are people who don't like you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1924.118s">That's</a>  what happened to the judge. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1926.959s">People</a>  were mean to her. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1929.6s">She</a>  did not listen about what they said. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1934.542s">She</a>  did not care about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1938.525s">If</a>  you have a job to do, you do it and don't listen to people mean to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1946.09s">At</a>  reset at home or school, don't let anybody make you sad because you have a heart. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1953.635s">Like</a>  the judge said, don't let mean people tell you what to do because you're special.</p>

    <p>[Diane Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1976.147s">I'd</a>  also like to thank Angela's family that's here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1979.168s">Thank</a>  you so much for coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1980.509s">I'm</a>  sure you're very proud of her. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1986.851s">And</a>  Mr. Johnson, the principal of the Roberts School, is here as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1989.652s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1989.912s">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1990.912s">Thank</a>  you all for sharing in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1992.793s">I</a>  know Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1993.073s">Vandekloot</a>  has something to say.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1994.714s">No,</a>  I just thank you to all of the students who came out tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1997.875s">It's</a>  so nice to hear you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=1999.755s">And</a>  I would like if we could send to Judge Klein a thank you <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2005.205s">note</a>  from the school committee thanking her for taking the time out of her schedule and coming back home.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2013.171s">Great</a>  things from some of the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2014.672s">Fabulous.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2369.196s">So</a>  the reading partners, we ask volunteers that are 55 years and older to volunteer in schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2377.881s">And</a>  our focus is on reading, and I train them to help support kids that struggle with reading in the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2386.423s">And</a>  then they go out to the schools and volunteer several hours a week, and they do it for the entire school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2393.046s">Wonderful.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2393.707s">Thank</a>  you so much.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2570.0s">Good</a>  evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2570.941s">A</a>  number of you have expressed interest in the wonderful work that was being done by Priscilla's Pantry, the free food pantry at Medford High School and the Medford Vocational Technical High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2584.206s">The</a>  next lunch will be hosted this Wednesday, February 6th from 12 to 12.30 in Caf 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2591.43s">There</a>  is a flyer in your folders with this information. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2595.031s">You</a>  are all welcome to attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2597.848s">In</a>  addition, Greta Smith, the nutrition specialist for the Medford Public Schools, provided me with the most updated data regarding students accessing the pantry. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2609.315s">So</a>  on December 6th, three visitors went to the pantry and three bags were taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2617.64s">On</a>  December 31st, it was also three and three. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2621.262s">On</a>  December 20th, there were 15 visitors and 15 bags. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2627.285s">On</a>  January 3rd, there were 11 visitors and 14 bags that were taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2632.547s">On</a>  January 10th, there were 18 visitors, 26 bags that were taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2639.83s">On</a>  January 17th, there were 9 visitors and 11 bags that were taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2646.333s">And</a>  just last week, on January 24th, <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2649.628s">there</a>  were 34 visitors and 40 bags were taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2654.911s">So</a>  the word is getting out and families are knowing that the food pantry is there as a support resource. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2663.336s">So</a>  the numbers have significantly increased from December 3rd of three visitors and three bags being taken to last week, 34 visitors and 40 bags being taken.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2675.107s">And</a>  we want to thank the YMCA for being the major moving party in this, as well as Mr. Hoff. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2681.829s">Priscilla's</a>  Pantry is named after his late wife. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2683.91s">So</a>  thank you for that.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2689.651s">So</a>  additionally, since we last met, I had the distinct pleasure to be asked to be a keynote speaker at the annual Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2697.934s">Luncheon,</a>  hosted by the Mystic Valley NAACP, Mayor Burke, <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2703.061s">Neil</a>  Osborne of the City's Diversity Office, the Medford Human Rights Commission, and the Medford Interfaith Clergy Association, and of course, St. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2712.404s">Raphael's</a>  Parish. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2714.265s">I</a>  spoke a little bit about the history of African Americans in the city of Medford, which goes back to approximately 1638, as well as my personal history, having grown up in West Medford, one of the oldest African American neighborhoods in the United States. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2731.265s">I</a>  felt like I had come full circle as I began my educational journey first at Hervey School for Kindergarten and then as a student at St. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2739.909s">Ray's</a>  for grades one through eight. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2743.591s">So</a>  many people came before me, paving the way for me as a first generation Haitian American to realize my dream to become superintendent of schools in my hometown of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2758.509s">Dr.</a>  King had strong faith and urged all people to love your neighbor as yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2764.854s">That</a>  definitely is a mantra of mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2767.957s">The</a>  night before the King luncheon on January 20th, the Patriots had won the AFC Championship. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2776.463s">And</a>  it resonated with me that day that if you fight the good fight and never give up until the clock reaches zero, you, we can all achieve victory. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2788.837s">At</a>  that time, the Patriots were underdogs for the AFC championship. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2793.918s">And</a>  yet, they came out on top. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2797.199s">And</a>  I shared, similarly, abolitionists and George Stearns, who was an abolitionist from Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2803.941s">They</a>  were underdogs in their time. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2806.462s">And</a>  yet, in the end, they came out on top. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2809.543s">And</a>  because of their sacrifice and the work that they fought for, I am able to stand here before you as your superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2817.696s">I'm</a>  honored to have participated in that wonderful event, and I'd also like to recognize that school committee members, Paulette Van der Kloot, Kathy Krutz, and Paul Russo were all participants in that event as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2831.182s">And</a>  the Mayor, Mayor Burke, again, hosted it and was also a keynote speaker. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2835.424s">So</a>  thank you for that.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2837.184s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2839.302s">On</a>  a different note, I just want to recognize the work that our Mustangs are doing, and that our Mustangs are doing pretty, I would say, outstanding work for this winter season. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2848.626s">They</a>  are really in good shape. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2850.287s">So</a>  some of our highlights include that yesterday, our Mustang, Tristan Howard, of the indoor track team, he won the Northeast Conference's 55-meter dash by completing the race in 6.6 seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2867.474s">Currently,</a>  he is the fastest in Massachusetts and New England in this event. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2880.181s">He</a>  also finished first in the long jump, jumping an impressive 21 feet, and he had the fastest 200 meter time in the relay race. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2891.927s">Tristan</a>  also qualified for the state championships in four different events. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2897.608s">the</a>  300-meter dash, the 55-meter dash, the shot put, and the long jump. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2903.712s">So</a>  great work, Tristan.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2905.013s">Nice</a>  job.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2910.416s">So</a>  our Lady Mustang basketball team won the annual Tufts University Cup versus Somerville, which was held last Sunday at Cousins Gym at Tufts University. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2922.99s">The</a>  boys basketball team have climbed and have made the MIAA State Tournament bid, and a highlight of their season to date was upsetting Everett, 57-56. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2935.234s">So</a>  one point victory, but we'll take it, a W for W. So we are very proud of all of our hardworking Mustang athletes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2947.257s">In</a>  addition, Mr. Maloney, he asked that I extend an invitation to all of the school committee members for Saturday, February 16th at 3 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2957.978s">at</a>  Le Conte Rink. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2959.966s">Mayor</a>  Burke will be honoring the late John Welch for his many years of service and dedication to both the La Conte Rink and the citizens of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2970.292s">Mr.</a>  Welch was an educator in the Somerville Public Schools who lost his battle with ALS in December. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2977.236s">So</a>  save the date, Saturday, February 16th at 3 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2980.057s">La</a>  Conte Rink. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2985.008s">I</a>  would also like to take this opportunity to welcome Chef Ryan Echols from Project Bread to the Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=2994.134s">Chef</a>  Echols, who works for Project Bread, started working at Medford High School to introduce some healthier and tastier meals to our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3004.476s">He</a>  will be at Medford High School until the end of March, when he'll move to the McGlynn K-8 school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3010.46s">He</a>  plans to work on skill development with our dedicated school food service staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3016.727s">The</a>  goal is to make sure that our staff feels comfortable preparing these meals when he moves on. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3024.655s">What</a>  Chef Eccles does is provide a sample of a menu item to students in one week and then offers that sample as a choice for lunch the following week. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3034.605s">This</a>  allows our students to try a wealth of different and healthy meal options. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3040.067s">Chef</a>  Eccles hails from California and previously served as a senior teaching assistant and lead chef at Mount Diablo High School in Concord, California, and a FoodWise Kids Instructor at the Center for Urban Education, Sustainable Agriculture <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3059.731s">in</a>  San Francisco. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3061.692s">Chef</a>  Eccles attended the San Francisco Baking Institute in the College of Worcester in Ohio. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3070.058s">He</a>  is currently a part-time chef at Haley House in Boston, and we are pleased he will be serving the staff and students of Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3079.805s">I</a>  would also like to take this time to congratulate our senior Arden Ingersoll. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3087.262s">who</a>  plays the string bass and who, for the second year in a row, has been accepted to the Massachusetts All-State Orchestra, which will perform at Symphony Hall in Boston on March 2, 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3100.971s">He</a>  was among 1,800 students who auditioned for the event, sponsored by the Massachusetts Music Educators Association at Shrewsbury High School on January 26. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3113.596s">Additionally,</a>  I'd also like to congratulate Medford High School freshman cellist Catherine Schmidt, who has been accepted to the prestigious Massachusetts Music Educators Association Northeast District Junior Festival. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3128.243s">Fewer</a>  than half of the more than 1,000 students who auditioned were selected to participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3135.486s">The</a>  festival concert will be held at the Galvin Middle School in Wakefield on March 31, 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3143.853s">So</a>  congratulations to Catherine as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3146.814s">So</a>  this past weekend, our Mustangs once again participated in the Ethics Bowl. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3153.376s">And</a>  so the Ethics Bowl team won the New England Ethics Bowl at Tufts University. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3159.738s">So</a>  congratulations for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3165.28s">So</a>  this debate style competition centered around 15 topical cases, which Medford has prepared for since September. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3174.163s">While</a>  they spend months preparing, they cannot bring anything with them to the competition, and their arguments must be given extemporaneously. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3183.748s">Once</a>  an argument is presented, the opposing team offers a rebuttal to which the team must respond, and this is followed up by a Q&A by the judges. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3194.434s">Teams</a>  are scored on the quality of their remarks in all three sections. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3199.04s">Medford</a>  competed against Phillips Exeter Academy, our sort of arch rival, Phillips Andover Academy, Lexington High School, Noble and Greenoff, Boston University Academy, and the River School. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3215.331s">Medford</a>  defeated Phillips Exeter Academy in the semifinal round and then beat Noble and Greenoff in the final round. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3223.857s">Some</a>  of the teams in attendance are ranked among the most elite schools in the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3229.767s">I</a>  really loved what their advisor, Eric Ensor, Medford High School English teacher said. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3237.032s">This</a>  win speaks to the caliber of the students here in Medford and the quality of the education they have received from the Medford public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3247.24s">I</a>  see it as an affirmation of public education as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3253.062s">The</a>  other regional was held in Purchase, New York. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3256.345s">So</a>  now Medford will compete virtually against the winner in a playoff. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3261.188s">Whoever</a>  wins will qualify to compete at the national competition in North Carolina at UMC Chapel Hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3269.935s">Medford</a>  attended the national competition there two years ago, where they finished 10th. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3277.741s">For</a>  the third year in a row, <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3280.082s">The</a>  trustees of the James and Thelma Connors Foundation are pleased to announce that the James and Thelma Connors Scholarship Fund application process is now open for the entire city of Medford students. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3297.885s">The</a>  scholarship fund will award up to 50 scholarships in the amount of $3,000 each to successful applicants. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3305.81s">Over</a>  the course of the past two years, over $219,000 has been distributed amongst Medford students. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3314.347s">Mr.</a>  Connors was a lifelong resident of Medford, who after his graduation from Medford High School, served in the United States Air Force during the Korean War. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3325.121s">When</a>  he returned, he worked in the trucking industry. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3328.249s">and</a>  also owned JC's lock and key service. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3332.231s">When</a>  he retired, Jim became a long time volunteer at the Lawrence Memorial Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3338.354s">Jim</a>  was known for always having a kind word and a smile for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3343.337s">When</a>  his sister Thelma passed away, Jim decided he'd like to establish a scholarship to assist Medford students. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3351.871s">Therefore,</a>  the James and Thelma Connors Foundation was developed and is now a 501c3 nonprofit private foundation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3361.239s">Applications</a>  can be made online. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3363.561s">The</a>  website link is posted on our Medford Public Schools website and on the blog. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3369.787s">Application</a>  deadline is February 28th, so do not let that deadline pass you by. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3377.285s">So</a>  over the course of the past two weeks, my team and I, along with members of Lesley University, completed our second round of math learning walks, visiting the Brooks, the Columbus, the Roberts, and the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3393.034s">We</a>  visited classrooms to witness a 15-minute snapshot of instruction, where we looked for evidence of the five core actions, which are evidence-based responses, <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3405.27s">academic</a>  discourse, productive struggle, access for all, and feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3411.295s">We</a>  met as a group afterwards to debrief and record our findings. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3415.718s">The</a>  principals at each of the schools asked that we please leave our findings posted so that their teachers could review them at their convenience. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3425.325s">And</a>  so that data is being shared with all the schools, the elementary schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3430.08s">Patricia</a>  Cren de Glarce, who is the Associate Dean of the Graduate School of Ed, as well as a director for the Center for Inclusive and Special Education at Lesley University, mentioned how she has already noticed and seen a difference in the quality of instruction since our first visit in September at the start of the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3451.754s">and</a>  she has been accompanying me on all of the learning walks. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3455.676s">Additionally,</a>  for this second round, we had Dr. Hilary Kreisberg, who is the director and assistant professor of the Center for Mathematics Achievement from Lesley University, also weighing in and participating this last time in two of the learning walks. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3471.763s">I</a>  also want to note that we had participation from many of our other school leaders, not just the four elementary schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3479.866s">We</a>  had Headmaster DeLeva, <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3481.839s">Principal</a>  Downs, Principal Tucci, Principal Toomey, our Director of Science, Rocco Sieri, Director of EL, Paul Textera, Director of Humanities, Dr. Nicole Chiesa, and Dr. Bernadette Riccadeli, our Director of Curriculum and Instruction for the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3500.69s">All</a>  of them were participating. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3502.091s">Our</a>  Associate Superintendent, Diane Caldwell, <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3504.806s">have</a>  participated in learning walks throughout the year, but we have scaled up our work so that it can continue to grow within the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3513.949s">Lastly,</a>  on Friday, I had the opportunity to go to a wonderful winter fest at the McGlynn Elementary School, and it was an evening of fun games, music, fun and merriment hosted by their PTO. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3528.687s">And</a>  the parents braved the cold weather, if you remember how cold it was last Friday, and they braved the cold temperatures and went out to participate in the winter festival at the McGlynn School. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3541.373s">So</a>  the last closing notes, I want to give you three more calendar notes to keep in mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3547.097s">For</a>  our rising ninth graders, this Wednesday is going to be course selection at the high school from 7 to 8.30 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3556.985s">And</a>  all of our directors will be available in the library to provide support and answer questions for our rising ninth graders who are going to register for high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3569.374s">Vaping.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3571.137s">Our</a>  vaping professional session is coming up this week, What Parents Should Know and Hidden in Plain Sight. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3578.059s">It's</a>  gonna be presented this Thursday, February 7th at the McGlynn School at 5.30 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3583.84s">This</a>  is a parent-guardian only event presented by the Medford Public Schools Health Department and the City of Medford's Prevention Office. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3593.122s">While</a>  this is being held, the McGlynn Middle School will be hosting a Valentine's Day dance that will begin at five o'clock for students. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3602.175s">And</a>  this coming Saturday, the annual Valentine Festival, which is hosted by the Friends of the Medford Family Network, it's going to be held this Saturday from 11 to 1 at the McGlynn School Cafeteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3617.68s">However,</a>  there's a special treat this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3620.381s">Please</a>  remember that prior to the festival in the McGlynn Auditorium, from 10 to 11 o'clock, there will be an opportunity to meet and greet all of the school committee members, <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3632.103s">and</a>  all are welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3633.884s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3637.727s">I</a>  spoke with Marie Cassidy, and in fact, in the auditorium, the magician is going to need to set up. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3644.452s">So</a>  we need a different location for that at the McGlynn, perhaps in the library, someplace where we can put a poster up and let people know we're there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3654.539s">And</a>  also, I think it would be advantageous if we had name tags for the committee members.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3661.845s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3662.365s">Thank</a>  you for that, and that is my report for this week.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3665.427s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3665.887s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3668.829s">Is</a>  there a motion to accept this report and place it on file by Mr. Russo, seconded by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3672.992s">Kreatz?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3673.272s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3674.492s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3674.733s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3675.473s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3677.414s">Item</a>  5, recommendation to approve field trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3679.775s">McGlynn</a>  and Andrews Middle School's trip to New York. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3682.877s">Mr.</a>  Tucci, Mr. Downs, and Michael DiClemente are here. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3686.419s">Is</a>  there a motion to approve your field trips? <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3692.332s">Come</a>  on, you've waited all evening.</p>

    <p>[Nick Tucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3693.973s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3694.634s">Good</a>  evening once again. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3695.395s">On</a>  behalf of the McGlynn Middle School, I'd like to present our proposal and answer any questions that you might have about our eighth grade student field trip to New York City. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3703.843s">The</a>  8th grade trip to New York City has been an annual tradition since our school opened in 2001. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3708.448s">The</a>  Andrews M. McGlynn Middle School held a parent meeting in the fall where the New York City trip was introduced and questions were answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3714.795s">This</a>  year, 60 students have signed up for the trip from the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3718.82s">The</a>  cost of the trip is $595 per student with scholarships offered for financially challenged families. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3726.237s">The</a>  trip is scheduled for the weekend of June 7th through 9th with buses departing Friday, June 7th at 6 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3732.939s">The</a>  itinerary for the trip includes a visit to the Intrepid Sea Air Space Museum, Times Square, Top of the Rock, Museum of Natural History, the 9-11 Memorial, a production of Stomp, and a trip to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3749.966s">Students</a>  remaining in school that Friday will participate in enrichment activities <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3754.317s">that</a>  support curriculum and social development. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3757.639s">I'd</a>  like to acknowledge the work of McGlynn Middle School teacher and New York City Trip Advisor, Sherry Flint, who was unable to make it this evening for her hard work and attention to detail during the course of her efforts for this field trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3768.985s">Her</a>  work over the many years in this role has enabled hundreds of middle school students to have this once-in-a-lifetime experience with their teachers and their peers. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3778.49s">At</a>  this time, I'd like to turn it over to the Andrews Middle School principal, Mr. Downs, and Andrews Middle School teacher and advisor to the New York City Trip, Michael DiClemente, for their presentation for the Andrews Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3788.616s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[ih84fneWXk0_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3791.257s">Good</a>  evening again. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3792.217s">So</a>  I'll be very brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3793.398s">I</a>  just again want to publicly thank someone else tonight before I give it over to Mike DiClemente. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3798.741s">Of</a>  course, I want to thank Michael for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3801.134s">I</a>  also want to thank our PTO. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3802.815s">Our</a>  PTO is behind our scholarships that we were able to give some students this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3806.877s">I</a>  also want to thank, I can't name them by name because they are anonymous, but there are members of this community who reached out to me to offer scholarships to students as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3816.561s">So</a>  those members, those people that are watching, I hope you know that I thank you dearly. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3821.263s">And</a>  those children are so very grateful to receive those scholarships. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3824.725s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3825.385s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3826.005s">And</a>  with no much more, I'm going to give it to Mr. D. Clemente.</p>

    <p>[Michael DiClemente]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3830.834s">In</a>  an effort not to be overly redundant, I'm really here just to answer questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3835.896s">I</a>  know last year and from the previous years, the idea was that no student would be left out who wanted to go on the trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3842.558s">There</a>  was no cap to how many kids could go. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3845.499s">I</a>  reached out to, as Mr. Downs said, to the PTO. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3848.7s">They</a>  were happy to give some money. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3850.08s">Mr.</a>  Downs also reached out. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3852.141s">So</a>  all the kids who applied for money from the Andrews received money. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3857.042s">The</a>  PTO gave two full scholarships and four half scholarships. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3861.625s">And</a>  then through the other families that donated money, everyone who needed it got it so far and we're working with anyone else who might need it who comes to us privately. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3870.892s">I</a>  know Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3871.232s">Satucci</a>  and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3872.233s">Flint</a>  have also worked out some plans to get people some money. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3877.316s">Also,</a>  just in an effort to make the trip as equitable as possible, we've met as a team through the middle <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3884.141s">We're</a>  not doing the exact same trip where all 200 students are going to the same place at the same time, but we will be going to all the same places throughout the trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3892.309s">The</a>  differences would be where we go for dinner, just because Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3894.991s">Flint</a>  had some ideas where she wanted to take her kids, and we've had some success at other places, so we've done that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3900.476s">But</a>  the museums, the show, are the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3904.02s">So</a>  I'm happy to answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3905.741s">Any</a>  questions that you all may have?</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3907.302s">How</a>  many students from the Andrews are taking up the spot?</p>

    <p>[Michael DiClemente]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3909.344s">124</a>  right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3910.024s">This</a>  is the biggest group I've been involved with.</p>

    <p>[ih84fneWXk0_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3912.686s">Three</a>  buses.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3913.487s">Wow.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3916.169s">That's</a>  fabulous. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3917.73s">Three</a>  buses or?</p>

    <p>[Michael DiClemente]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3918.991s">Yeah,</a>  we had to extend to a third bus this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3921.673s">Like</a>  I said, we don't cap it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3923.734s">So</a>  we extended to a third bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3925.376s">And</a>  some of the prices went up. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3926.957s">That's</a>  why the trip is more expensive, obviously, than it's been in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3930.399s">But</a>  we try to work our best to keep it as low as possible.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3934.362s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3934.742s">Mr.</a>  Russo.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3935.959s">Thank</a>  you very much, and thanks for hitting a lot of the questions I had before I got to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3940.283s">So</a>  how many students potentially could go with the McGlynn?</p>

    <p>[Nick Tucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3946.348s">We</a>  have two buses going at this point in time, and I believe each bus holds 55. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3949.37s">I</a>  mean, how many students are eligible to go? <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3952.893s">The</a>  entire eighth grade class is eligible to go.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3954.935s">Right</a>  now, we have- Can you not make me look that up, or do you know it?</p>

    <p>[Nick Tucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3957.257s">I</a>  know it's about 164 students- Thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3959.338s">At</a>  this point in time, and we have 60 students that have signed up at this point in time to go.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3965.422s">And</a>  the Andrews?</p>

    <p>[ih84fneWXk0_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3972.226s">Right</a>  now we have about 165 eighth graders, and we have 124 going.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3978.77s">I</a>  mean, I guess I'm just, the Andrews numbers are pretty amazing, and I'm glad that we have been able to find money for kids that need it so they can go, but I'm sure everybody can recognize those ratios are not anywhere</p>

    <p>[Michael DiClemente]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=3995.78s">Similar</a>  I mean just to speak to that just a bit just from my history with it We generally hit about 50% of the eighth graders for the Andrews.</p>

    <p>[Nick Tucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4004.125s">This</a>  is an outlier I mean just just to kind of speak to that And the number at the McGlynn is Consistent with the amount of students that have gone in past years from what I've gathered to as well So this number is very consistent with past years a participation rate to as well at the school I</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4025.653s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4027.174s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4028.354s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4029.655s">I</a>  see your concerns, my colleagues' concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4033.737s">We</a>  just want to make sure that there is no reason that any student's not participating. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4041.44s">I</a>  also worry about the small group that's going to be left at the Andrews and what they'll be doing with their time. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4048.623s">Well,</a>  it's a weekend trip, but on that Friday, as long as they don't <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4053.058s">you</a>  know, is that community everybody's been reached out to to make sure that they're welcome to go on the trip?</p>

    <p>[ih84fneWXk0_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4060.26s">At</a>  this time we were still finalizing exactly who the chaperones are going to be and then of course we have to find coverage for all those people that are chaperoning and if we are able to find a chaperone or two we are going to try to do a day trip in conjunction again with the PTO for those students that are not going.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4079.262s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4081.002s">My</a>  other question is insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4082.903s">I</a>  didn't see it listed here. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4084.383s">Insurance.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4086.304s">As</a>  part of the fee involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4089.545s">We</a>  did have to cancel one of these trips at one point because of things going on in the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4095.066s">And</a>  as a committee, we voted to make sure that parents didn't lose money and the district helped out. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4100.707s">But</a>  we made it so that way every trip from that point on had to cover insurance in case that were to happen.</p>

    <p>[Nick Tucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4107.745s">And</a>  my understanding is, too, as well, the company that we're working through right now has property damage insurance as a part of the trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4113.849s">So,</a>  in fact, we do have a report that we can share with you, too, as well, that's pretty detailed in terms of the level of insurance that's provided by this company.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4121.814s">So</a>  for cancellation, if the school committee decides that it's for any reason not safe to send our children to another state as that trip comes closer, that is covered, and the parents will receive all of their money back?</p>

    <p>[Nick Tucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4141.311s">Yeah,</a>  that's a question we can get back to you if you don't mind.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4143.592s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Nick Tucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4143.912s">With</a>  regards to whether or not we'll be able to recoup any costs.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4147.473s">I</a>  know it might add to the ultimate cost of every child.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4150.354s">It's</a>  a separate policy.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4152.015s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4152.315s">But</a>  it is a policy to make sure that that is added to every trip, because we had to cancel at one point. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4160.078s">And</a>  it was a financial hardship for some parents to lose their deposits. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4165.42s">And</a>  the school system did step up in that occasion. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4170.571s">Do</a>  you need this approval tonight, or could you get us those answers before we approve this? <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4177.612s">Or</a>  we can approve it and just make sure that that policy is adhered to.</p>
