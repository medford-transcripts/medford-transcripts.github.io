[SPEAKER_09]: In the minutes we talked about our having I believe a committee of the whole I don't know if it's in the minutes on health and I was wondering if the committee wanted to go to Zumba before we have that committee meeting and just get a little workout and get our blood flowing I was at Zumba up the high school and I spoke the instructor and she'd be she'd love to have us all so

9
00:01:01,028 --> 00:01:14,017
[SPEAKER_09]: When we schedule that, if we want to do that, I thought it would be, since it's about health and movement, it would be a fun way for us to all have a good time together and then sit and talk about the health of our students.

10
00:01:14,857 --> 00:01:16,218
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a second on the floor?

[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

28
00:01:47,176 --> 00:01:49,418
[SPEAKER_09]: So on page 2 of 21, the top three items,

29
00:01:54,855 --> 00:02:00,538
[SPEAKER_09]: The item, the vendor name is Amici's Pizza, and the account description is building repairs.

30
00:02:00,598 --> 00:02:05,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, so that's food for the inmates while they are doing work within the buildings.

31
00:02:05,781 --> 00:02:06,482
[SPEAKER_06]: That makes sense.

32
00:02:06,562 --> 00:02:10,144
[SPEAKER_09]: When I was reading it over the weekend, I'm like, okay.

33
00:02:11,445 --> 00:02:16,848
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's great if that's how we're paying for building repairs and upgrades.

34
00:02:24,295 --> 00:02:32,441
[SPEAKER_09]: It lines down, it says professional technical services education and it lists a Mr. Lino.

35
00:02:32,821 --> 00:02:38,425
[SPEAKER_09]: I keep seeing his name throughout the... Yes, it's the evening school.

36
00:02:38,765 --> 00:02:41,407
[SPEAKER_06]: He provides training for the evening school program.

37
00:02:41,767 --> 00:02:42,568
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thank you.

38
00:02:42,588 --> 00:02:51,094
[SPEAKER_09]: On page 14 of 21.

39
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,101
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry for jumping around.

40
00:02:55,121 --> 00:02:57,623
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just trying to get acclimated.

41
00:02:59,124 --> 00:03:08,552
[SPEAKER_09]: Three quarters of the way down, in the amount of $6,877 and $4,776, it says Trustees of Boston.

42
00:03:10,074 --> 00:03:10,854
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if it's college.

43
00:03:10,874 --> 00:03:16,199
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that's tuition for special education services under Circuit Breaker.

44
00:03:16,859 --> 00:03:17,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, OK.

45
00:03:18,421 --> 00:03:18,821
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

46
00:03:19,802 --> 00:03:20,543
[SPEAKER_09]: And then.

47
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:26,120
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe that's all of them.

48
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:26,760
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

49
00:03:27,821 --> 00:03:28,301
[SPEAKER_14]: Very good.

50
00:03:28,361 --> 00:03:29,522
[SPEAKER_09]: Roll call vote, please.

51
00:03:31,283 --> 00:03:31,563
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

52
00:03:32,584 --> 00:03:35,986
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

53
00:03:36,947 --> 00:03:37,527
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

54
00:03:37,627 --> 00:03:38,368
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

55
00:03:38,668 --> 00:03:38,948
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

56
00:03:39,048 --> 00:03:40,889
[SPEAKER_10]: Six in the affirmative, one absent.

57
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:42,130
[SPEAKER_10]: That's in favor.

58
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:43,971
[SPEAKER_10]: Approval of payrolls.

59
00:03:47,413 --> 00:03:48,434

[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, 6 in the affirmative, 1 absent.

64

[SPEAKER_10]: Motion is approved.

00:04:05,312 --> 00:04:06,372
[SPEAKER_10]: Report of Secretary.

66
00:04:06,392 --> 00:04:07,192
[SPEAKER_10]: Revised.

67
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,733
[SPEAKER_10]: Former Secretary report.

68
00:04:08,853 --> 00:04:09,593
[SPEAKER_10]: Kathy Kretz.

69
00:04:09,773 --> 00:04:11,074
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a revised report?

70
00:04:15,566 --> 00:04:16,606
[SPEAKER_13]: I left out the names.

71
00:04:16,626 --> 00:04:20,149
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just want to go through the names again.

72
00:04:20,229 --> 00:04:23,952
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to thank the City Hall, the Finance and Auditing Department.

73
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:30,777
[SPEAKER_13]: I also want to thank the Griffin High School, Accounts and Payroll and Valuation Department, and the JoJo Department.

74
00:04:30,897 --> 00:04:37,262
[SPEAKER_13]: And I want to give a special thanks to Kelly Cavanaugh, Cynthia Byrne, Juwanda McGraw, Michelle Kagan,

75
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:53,879
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to place this report on file by Mr. Kretz, seconded by Ms.

76
00:04:53,899 --> 00:04:54,579
[SPEAKER_10]: DiBenedetto.

77
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,580
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

78
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:55,680
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

79
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,040
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

80
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:57,840
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

81
00:04:59,481 --> 00:05:00,341
[SPEAKER_10]: Report of committee.

82
00:05:00,441 --> 00:05:02,121
[SPEAKER_10]: Support Services Subcommittee.

83
00:05:02,141 --> 00:05:04,502
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the Medication Administration Policy.

84
00:05:04,582 --> 00:05:06,222
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Russo, chair of that committee.

85
00:05:12,285 --> 00:05:17,969
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Support Services Subcommittee met in August of last year, which I recommend in the future.

86
00:05:17,989 --> 00:05:20,732
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very, very hot.

87
00:05:21,032 --> 00:05:21,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Very hot.

88
00:05:21,532 --> 00:05:22,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry about this.

89
00:05:22,773 --> 00:05:27,837
[SPEAKER_02]: And we met to update the medication administration policy for the district.

90
00:05:27,877 --> 00:05:30,999
[SPEAKER_02]: It had needed a lot of updates.

91
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:37,244
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Support Services Subcommittee met just before this meeting.

92
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:42,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Most approved the policy to come before the full committee.

93
00:05:44,335 --> 00:05:52,821
[SPEAKER_02]: There were some clarifications around busing, situations when nursing was not available, and self-administration changes were made to the policy.

94
00:05:55,303 --> 00:05:57,044
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is about it.

95
00:05:57,585 --> 00:05:58,165
[SPEAKER_10]: Very good.

96
00:05:59,146 --> 00:05:59,946
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Benedetto.

97
00:05:59,986 --> 00:06:00,487
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

98
00:06:01,408 --> 00:06:04,530
[SPEAKER_09]: I read through the policies, and I really like a lot of the updates.

99
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:08,393
[SPEAKER_09]: There is something that I came across with a parent

100
00:06:09,414 --> 00:06:21,538
[SPEAKER_09]: recently that I'd like to see added, and that is a school nurse may not consult with the student's physician and get medication orders without parental permission.

101
00:06:24,619 --> 00:06:26,019
[SPEAKER_07]: So let me clarify that.

102
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:38,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Following the Department of Public Health regulations, when nurses are administering medications, it is within the Board of Registration and Nursing guidelines that we have access to physicians to clarify

103
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:40,051
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not aware of any medication orders.

104
00:06:40,531 --> 00:06:40,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

105
00:06:40,771 --> 00:06:42,332
[SPEAKER_09]: Clarification is one thing.

106
00:06:42,712 --> 00:06:59,379
[SPEAKER_09]: Getting a different order from a doctor without a parent being notified is a major issue that I feel that this needs to be added, that parental permission for any, you know, changes.

107
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,180
[SPEAKER_09]: Like a nurse is calling a pediatrician.

108
00:07:02,841 --> 00:07:07,123
[SPEAKER_09]: Getting a change in a child's medication order or

109
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:11,512
[SPEAKER_09]: And not notifying a parent is not appropriate.

110
00:07:12,313 --> 00:07:23,201
[SPEAKER_09]: And so therefore, I want to make sure parental notification is either given prior to that phone call or after that phone call that an order has been changed.

111
00:07:23,681 --> 00:07:31,607
[SPEAKER_09]: Because in this situation, the parent was never notified of the change from her child's physician to the school.

112
00:07:33,028 --> 00:07:35,110
[SPEAKER_07]: I think probably you and I should talk about that situation in private.

113
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:37,672
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I think it should be a policy on this document.

114
00:07:38,396 --> 00:07:40,617
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't think it's a conversation privately.

115
00:07:40,697 --> 00:07:46,698
[SPEAKER_09]: It should never have happened to any parent to find out in a meeting in that it should be part of this policy.

116
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:48,318
[SPEAKER_09]: And there is a motion on the floor.

117
00:07:48,358 --> 00:07:49,399
[SPEAKER_10]: What section are you amending?

118
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:56,300
[SPEAKER_09]: Under Medication Orders, Parental Consent.

119
00:07:57,701 --> 00:07:57,821
E?

120
00:07:59,341 --> 00:07:59,641
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

121
00:08:02,932 --> 00:08:04,133
[SPEAKER_07]: What page is that in?

122
00:08:04,574 --> 00:08:06,155
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the first page of the school.

123
00:08:06,415 --> 00:08:07,836
[SPEAKER_10]: It starts on the first page.

124
00:08:08,137 --> 00:08:08,697
[SPEAKER_09]: Page one.

125
00:08:09,818 --> 00:08:13,522
[SPEAKER_10]: And then which one are you?

126
00:08:13,642 --> 00:08:18,266
[SPEAKER_10]: Item two says a school nurse shall ensure that there is written authorization by the parent or guardian.

127
00:08:19,627 --> 00:08:20,868
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's a consent form.

128
00:08:21,088 --> 00:08:24,952
[SPEAKER_09]: A consent to administer medication, but not to call.

129
00:08:25,592 --> 00:08:27,014
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, to administer it.

130
00:08:27,054 --> 00:08:29,576
[SPEAKER_09]: But this particular situation was

131
00:08:30,138 --> 00:08:43,266
[SPEAKER_09]: the nurse called the doctor, the order was changed after that conversation and the parent was never notified that they called the doctor or that an order was changed and the parent got no notification.

132
00:08:44,627 --> 00:08:48,829
[SPEAKER_09]: So I want that addressed in this policy since we're reviewing it.

133
00:08:49,049 --> 00:08:56,634
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think that any parent would want the school nurse to change their child's orders with their doctor and not be notified.

134
00:08:56,654 --> 00:08:58,775
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that customary?

135
00:09:00,044 --> 00:09:04,246
[SPEAKER_07]: It's customary to call the physicians for clarification.

136
00:09:04,846 --> 00:09:07,167
[SPEAKER_07]: But there was a change, and the parent wasn't notified.

137
00:09:09,748 --> 00:09:13,529
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think this is the place for us to discuss this.

138
00:09:13,609 --> 00:09:28,895
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it absolutely is, because we're talking about policy changes in this department at this meeting, and that's something that I had firsthand knowledge of happening, and it should be addressed in these policies.

139
00:09:30,473 --> 00:09:34,419
[SPEAKER_01]: thing would be for us to bring it back to the subcommittee and address it in subcommittee.

140
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:35,541
[SPEAKER_01]: So motioned.

141
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:37,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

142
00:09:37,484 --> 00:09:38,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Van de Kloot.

143
00:09:38,705 --> 00:09:38,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

144
00:09:39,316 --> 00:09:51,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Would it make sense, since we have the rest of the policy here, to go ahead with the approval so everything else is updated and... I'd rather this... This is such an important issue.

145
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:55,069
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have respect for... We have a meeting next week.

146
00:09:55,149 --> 00:10:06,579
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe we can bring it back next week so that it's not... Are you making a motion to send this back to the subcommittee for further deliberation?

147
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:19,306
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, I'm asking to amend the policy and add that a school nurse may not consult with the student's physician and get medication orders or changes without parental permission.

148
00:10:19,587 --> 00:10:20,287
[SPEAKER_10]: Where do you want that?

149
00:10:20,667 --> 00:10:23,449
[SPEAKER_09]: I want that in section E. Section what?

150
00:10:23,869 --> 00:10:23,989
[SPEAKER_09]: E.

151
00:10:24,009 --> 00:10:23,989
8.

152
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:28,031
[SPEAKER_01]: E. I feel it should go back to subcommittee.

153
00:10:28,904 --> 00:10:30,224
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a motion on the floor to add it.

154
00:10:30,244 --> 00:10:36,226
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a motion on the floor to amend it under section E. We're in section E. We need to be specific.

155
00:10:36,286 --> 00:10:38,147
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a policy, so it has to be specific.

156
00:10:43,008 --> 00:10:43,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor Burke.

157
00:10:43,508 --> 00:10:43,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

158
00:10:43,588 --> 00:10:43,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Vander Kloot.

159
00:10:44,429 --> 00:10:48,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Erin, I understand your concern and the importance of what you're saying.

160
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:55,792
[SPEAKER_04]: I have some questions about how it should be worded correctly, because there's also an obligation by the physician as well.

161
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:02,206
[SPEAKER_04]: So to just put all the onus on how we write it has to include both parties.

162
00:11:03,327 --> 00:11:09,053
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'm reluctant to all of a sudden just put a sentence in here and say we're going to approve it tonight.

163
00:11:09,413 --> 00:11:10,795
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hearing your concern.

164
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:13,718
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand there was an issue that I know nothing about.

165
00:11:14,698 --> 00:11:23,803
[SPEAKER_04]: but I'm asking that we would give us an opportunity, you know, we could perhaps do it at the beginning of our next meeting.

166
00:11:23,863 --> 00:11:26,765
[SPEAKER_04]: We could also have a subcommittee meeting, so we could bring it back next week.

167
00:11:26,785 --> 00:11:29,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Wouldn't it be a long time frame?

168
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:30,187
[SPEAKER_04]: Would that be acceptable?

169
00:11:30,487 --> 00:11:37,370
[SPEAKER_09]: I remove my amendment and again ask it to go to subcommittee, so that way the wording is correct.

170
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:40,212
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're asking to send this back to subcommittee?

171
00:11:40,252 --> 00:11:42,233
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, but I don't want the document

172
00:11:42,638 --> 00:11:44,258
[SPEAKER_09]: approved until this issue is.

173
00:11:44,338 --> 00:11:44,558
[SPEAKER_09]: Fine.

174
00:11:44,899 --> 00:11:45,079
[SPEAKER_09]: So.

175
00:11:45,099 --> 00:11:48,059
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a motion on the floor to send this to subcommittee.

176
00:11:48,099 --> 00:11:49,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Second it with the added.

177
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:49,520
[SPEAKER_10]: Second it.

178
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,901
[SPEAKER_04]: We do not have anything before our meeting next week.

179
00:11:53,961 --> 00:11:54,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that correct?

180
00:11:54,561 --> 00:11:54,921
[SPEAKER_04]: We have.

181
00:11:54,961 --> 00:11:57,122
[SPEAKER_10]: The chair of the subcommittee would call the meeting.

182
00:11:57,222 --> 00:11:57,442
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

183
00:11:57,522 --> 00:12:00,862
[SPEAKER_01]: Next week's meeting, we do have committee of the whole at 615.

184
00:12:02,303 --> 00:12:05,684
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we will also have executive session on Monday the 11th.

185
00:12:06,384 --> 00:12:06,664
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

186
00:12:06,704 --> 00:12:08,164
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have to figure out when we can do that.

187
00:12:08,264 --> 00:12:08,624
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

188
00:12:08,684 --> 00:12:10,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, we'll do it as quickly as possible.

189
00:12:10,485 --> 00:12:11,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Russo.

190
00:12:11,427 --> 00:12:12,968
[SPEAKER_02]: I just have a question about this policy.

191
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:17,252
[SPEAKER_02]: And unlike other policies, we don't just approve the policy.

192
00:12:17,292 --> 00:12:19,454
[SPEAKER_02]: The school physician actually has to approve it as well.

193
00:12:19,555 --> 00:12:24,459
[SPEAKER_07]: The school physician signs off on it, along with myself and the superintendent.

194
00:12:24,659 --> 00:12:24,739
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

195
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:28,483
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, that's why I think that moving it to subcommittee also makes sense.

196
00:12:28,643 --> 00:12:29,003
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

197
00:12:29,244 --> 00:12:34,909
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we have a date for that, then when we do, yes, then I'll invite Dr. Sabia to join us.

198
00:12:36,102 --> 00:12:39,703
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, there's a motion on the floor to move this paper to subcommittee, seconded by Ms.

199
00:12:39,723 --> 00:12:40,423
[SPEAKER_10]: Van de Kloot.

200
00:12:40,743 --> 00:12:41,503
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

201
00:12:41,523 --> 00:12:42,063
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

202
00:12:42,463 --> 00:12:43,184
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

203
00:12:43,544 --> 00:12:44,264
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

204
00:12:46,124 --> 00:12:46,284
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

205
00:12:48,365 --> 00:12:50,045
[SPEAKER_10]: A motion for suspension of the rules, Ms.

206
00:12:50,065 --> 00:12:50,425
[SPEAKER_10]: Van de Kloot?

207
00:12:50,445 --> 00:12:54,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor Burke, yes, I'd like to suspend the rules and I would like to change the order of the rules.

208
00:12:54,866 --> 00:12:58,687
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to have the superintendent's updates and comments follow item four.

209
00:12:59,547 --> 00:12:59,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Please.

210
00:13:00,327 --> 00:13:02,168
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a motion for suspension of the rules.

211
00:13:02,228 --> 00:13:02,848
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

212
00:13:02,868 --> 00:13:02,928
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

213
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:04,571
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

214
00:13:04,612 --> 00:13:05,393
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

215
00:13:06,094 --> 00:13:09,661
[SPEAKER_10]: Before us right now is item 2, report on project 351.

216
00:13:09,721 --> 00:13:09,942
[SPEAKER_10]: Ms.

217
00:13:09,982 --> 00:13:12,466
[SPEAKER_10]: Caldwell, Margaret Hines, and Vishal Romero.

218
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening, everyone.

219
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:30,689
[SPEAKER_05]: So Project 351 is an independent nonprofit organization that builds a movement of youth-led service by engaging unsung heroes from each of the Massachusetts 351 cities and towns.

220
00:13:31,429 --> 00:13:44,573
[SPEAKER_05]: United for a year of leadership and service, ambassadors transform communities, elevate kindness, advance social justice, and gain courage, compassion, and capabilities to lead change.

221
00:13:45,473 --> 00:13:51,495
[SPEAKER_05]: This was founded by Governor Deval Patrick in 2011 and now convened by Governor Charlie Baker.

222
00:13:51,575 --> 00:14:03,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Project 351 fosters unity and strengthens the ethic of service to the engagement and enrichment of 8th grade ambassadors from each of the cities and towns.

223
00:14:04,775 --> 00:14:12,542
[SPEAKER_05]: As a member of 351, ambassadors represent their family, school, and community with honor, humility, and pride.

224
00:14:13,243 --> 00:14:21,971
[SPEAKER_05]: Over a year's term, they engage with a community of peers, team-based service projects, and leadership development opportunities.

225
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:29,244
[SPEAKER_05]: respect, a cooperative spirit, and fun are hallmarks of successful ambassador teams.

226
00:14:30,224 --> 00:14:34,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Ambassadors are expected to do their best as a member of 351.

227
00:14:34,426 --> 00:14:43,690
[SPEAKER_05]: They are encouraged to use the service and leadership skills they develop to address important issues facing their local communities.

228
00:14:44,685 --> 00:14:51,227
[SPEAKER_05]: A representative from the Andrews and McGlynn's Middle School participated in this event the weekend of January 19th.

229
00:14:51,887 --> 00:14:57,888
[SPEAKER_05]: I've asked these students to tell you a little bit of what they've learned and what they will do moving forward.

230
00:14:58,388 --> 00:15:11,751
[SPEAKER_05]: At this time, I'd like to invite Principal Nick Tucci up with his guest, Margaret Hines, to talk a little bit about Project 351, and then Michael Downs, the principal of the Andrews School, to come up as well.

231
00:15:12,572 --> 00:15:13,152
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Tucci?

232
00:15:13,892 --> 00:15:14,232
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome.

233
00:15:15,132 --> 00:15:15,792
[SPEAKER_23]: Good evening, everyone.

234
00:15:16,393 --> 00:15:16,973
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening.

235
00:15:19,494 --> 00:15:20,994
[SPEAKER_23]: Good evening, Medford School Committee.

236
00:15:21,195 --> 00:15:33,960
[SPEAKER_23]: It's my pleasure to be here tonight to speak with you about the involvement of two of our middle school students in Medford who participated in last month's Project 351 launch day on Saturday, January 19th in Boston.

237
00:15:35,994 --> 00:15:47,156
[SPEAKER_23]: 8th grade McGlynn Middle School student, Margaret Hines, and 8th grade Andrews Middle School student, Vishal Romero, were nominated by their teachers and selected by their school principal to represent our community.

238
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:59,578
[SPEAKER_23]: These 8th grade students who represented Medford were chosen on the basis of Project 351's core values of their ambassadors, which are kindness, compassion, humility, and gratitude.

239
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:01,739
[SPEAKER_23]: According to Project 351's mission,

240
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:13,480
[SPEAKER_23]: They seek to develop the next generation of community-first service leaders through customized service learning, hands-on community building, and values-based leadership training.

241
00:16:14,361 --> 00:16:30,773
[SPEAKER_23]: Both Margaret and Vishal had wonderful experiences on launch day at Faneuil Hall in Boston, where they got a chance to hear Governor Baker address the young leaders, perform acts of kindness in their community, and engage in leadership activities that will be a lifetime experience for them all.

242
00:16:31,634 --> 00:16:38,780
[SPEAKER_23]: They had the opportunity to develop their leadership skills to one day uplift, unite, and transform the communities in which they live.

243
00:16:39,841 --> 00:16:51,651
[SPEAKER_23]: We look forward to supporting their leadership project this year through their clubs within the schools, such as the Student Council and the CCSR, Census for Citizenship and Social Responsibility, where they can carry through with their projects.

244
00:16:52,191 --> 00:16:57,015
[SPEAKER_23]: At this point in time, I'd love to turn it over to the McGlynn Middle School representative, Margaret Hines.

245
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:04,820
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

246
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,041
[SPEAKER_17]: And my name is Margaret Hines, as you just heard.

247
00:17:07,221 --> 00:17:09,782
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm the eighth grade representative for the McGlynn Middle School.

248
00:17:10,302 --> 00:17:15,724
[SPEAKER_17]: And I wrote a reflection that I would like to share with you here today on my experience at launch day of Project 351.

249
00:17:17,345 --> 00:17:25,728
[SPEAKER_17]: So Project 351 had actually never been on my radar until I was asked to participate in December of 2018 by my principal, Mr. Tucci.

250
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:33,431
[SPEAKER_17]: As an eighth grade student going into a day-long community service project on the weekend that I'd never heard before, I didn't know what to expect at all.

251
00:17:34,532 --> 00:17:46,237
[SPEAKER_17]: At the time, I had no inclination that I would have such a wonderful and amazing experience at Project 351, nor did I have any idea that I would find a whole community of people who all are devoted to creating a better world.

252
00:17:47,078 --> 00:17:56,462
[SPEAKER_17]: My day at Project 351 was full of incredible opportunities and phenomenal people, and I'm glad to say that this first meeting is only the start of a remarkable year of service to come.

253
00:17:57,762 --> 00:17:58,823
[SPEAKER_17]: The day I spent at Project 351

254
00:17:59,956 --> 00:18:07,860
[SPEAKER_17]: was a great blend of hearing from community leaders, meeting other eighth graders from across the state of Massachusetts, and taking action through community service.

255
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,162
[SPEAKER_17]: The morning was kicked off at 8 when we all boarded our regional buses to Faneuil Hall.

256
00:18:13,982 --> 00:18:19,905
[SPEAKER_17]: On the bus, the alumni of Project 351 answered some of our initial questions and played some ice breakers with all of us.

257
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:28,529
[SPEAKER_17]: This first bus ride of the day was when I realized that everyone here was willing and open to starting a conversation to find out more about who everyone else was.

258
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:29,850
[SPEAKER_17]: and is.

259
00:18:30,711 --> 00:18:37,375
[SPEAKER_17]: Therefore, there is something to be said about the beauty of a place where everyone else you meet is new, and everyone else they meet is new.

260
00:18:38,035 --> 00:18:43,899
[SPEAKER_17]: And there's no way to be clicky or awkward about it, because you're all just saying hi to each other, and you're all in the exact same position.

261
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:53,565
[SPEAKER_17]: After our regional buses dropped us off at Faneuil Hall, we all found our service hero groups, each named after someone who had contributed to making the world a better place all their life.

262
00:18:55,059 --> 00:19:01,724
[SPEAKER_17]: After learning about our service heroes and meeting with our teams, the leaders of Project 351 explained how the day was going to go.

263
00:19:02,205 --> 00:19:07,309
[SPEAKER_17]: And our Massachusetts community leaders came to speak about their experiences with service and leading in the Commonwealth.

264
00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:23,282
[SPEAKER_17]: Leaders such as Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, news anchor Lisa Hughes, and Governor Charlie Baker all shared their experiences with us and talked about how community service has the power to impact the lives of all people, whether you're the one doing the service or on the receiving end of the benefits.

265
00:19:25,367 --> 00:19:30,151
[SPEAKER_17]: Once these leaders were done sharing their stories and advice, we all headed out to do some community service of our own.

266
00:19:30,911 --> 00:19:40,419
[SPEAKER_17]: My team went to a school in the Boston area and collaborated with a group called Service Village and the Martin Richard Foundation to create packages of books for underprivileged children and Valentine's Day cards for veterans.

267
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:45,043
[SPEAKER_17]: Since there were over 351 of us, not all groups went to the same places.

268
00:19:45,983 --> 00:19:50,947
[SPEAKER_17]: Some of us went to work with an organization called Cradles to Crowns.

269
00:19:51,628 --> 00:19:54,050
[SPEAKER_17]: And some of us went to paint the inside of an old preschool.

270
00:19:55,243 --> 00:20:04,325
[SPEAKER_17]: While at the service sites, we had more time to talk to each other and learn more about where everyone else was from and learn more about how we as a state can come together to create positive change.

271
00:20:05,686 --> 00:20:13,228
[SPEAKER_17]: Being an eighth grader who lives in Medford and has never lived anywhere else, it can be easy to forget that Massachusetts is a really big place.

272
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:19,969
[SPEAKER_17]: And there are lots of places in Massachusetts with lots and lots of people, who, surprise, are also from Massachusetts.

273
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:21,870
[SPEAKER_17]: In the afternoon,

274
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:27,654
[SPEAKER_17]: Around 3, we all piled back onto our buses and headed back to Faneuil Hall.

275
00:20:28,735 --> 00:20:40,567
[SPEAKER_17]: For the last few hours of the day, we shared our experiences at our different service sites, talked about what we learned, continued to meet even more new people, there were a lot of us, and even filmed a good luck message for the Patriots.

276
00:20:41,487 --> 00:20:44,670
[SPEAKER_17]: By the end of the day, we were all exhausted in the best way and happy to go home.

277
00:20:49,077 --> 00:20:55,560
[SPEAKER_17]: One of the messages of Project 351 taught me was to not hesitate to start making change in my community.

278
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:01,222
[SPEAKER_17]: Project 351's motto of Unite, Act, Lead is a perfect summary of how this may be done.

279
00:21:02,023 --> 00:21:11,967
[SPEAKER_17]: The first step in any movement for change is to unite, to bring together your community around one shared goal and to make sure everyone is heard in uniting towards this goal.

280
00:21:12,827 --> 00:21:14,028
[SPEAKER_17]: The second step is to act.

281
00:21:14,598 --> 00:21:15,739
[SPEAKER_17]: Acting can mean many things.

282
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:24,766
[SPEAKER_17]: It can mean to have one large change come over a community at once, or it can mean to bring change through small steps, eventually leading up to a larger picture.

283
00:21:25,727 --> 00:21:28,910
[SPEAKER_17]: Either way, the ability to act also means there must be an ability to lead.

284
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:35,034
[SPEAKER_17]: In leading, you are bringing the circle to a full close and allowing positive change to happen and continue happening.

285
00:21:35,995 --> 00:21:41,860
[SPEAKER_17]: The main question brought about in my time at Project 351 was, how can I bring these changes to my community?

286
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,481
[SPEAKER_17]: And well, the answer isn't simple.

287
00:21:45,241 --> 00:21:48,583
[SPEAKER_17]: Everyone has a different town, school, family, city, you name it.

288
00:21:49,044 --> 00:22:01,311
[SPEAKER_17]: It would be impossible to come up with a one-size-fits-all formula to apply to any community situation, which is why it is important to put basic principles in place, principles such as the ones given by Project 351's message of Unite, Act, Lead.

289
00:22:03,209 --> 00:22:12,153
[SPEAKER_17]: In bringing these founding principles to our Medford community, we would be able to accomplish so much more and be able to inspire so many more young people to come forward and lead positive change.

290
00:22:12,713 --> 00:22:17,876
[SPEAKER_17]: In many situations, communities are improved by just allowing for a safe place for discussions about change to grow.

291
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:22,678
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't even have to know what those discussions might be as long as we're open to hearing about them.

292
00:22:23,797 --> 00:22:27,879
[SPEAKER_17]: Change that comes in leaps and bounds doesn't often knock on the door until later in the conversation.

293
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:37,482
[SPEAKER_17]: So if we're aiming to create a community in which we work our hardest to take action, we must first realize that the only way to continue in unity is to listen to the ideas and opinions of our peers.

294
00:22:37,962 --> 00:22:38,362
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

295
00:22:38,603 --> 00:22:39,463
[SPEAKER_17]: Very good.

296
00:22:47,286 --> 00:22:47,866
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Margaret.

297
00:22:47,926 --> 00:22:52,828
[SPEAKER_23]: It's now my pleasure to turn it over to Mr. Downs, principal of the Andrews Middle School and Vishal Romero.

298
00:22:59,558 --> 00:23:00,439
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening, everyone.

299
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:04,221
[SPEAKER_12]: With not much of a do, I would like to introduce Vishal Romero.

300
00:23:04,281 --> 00:23:15,449
[SPEAKER_12]: But I would like to publicly thank one teacher in particular, and that would be Mr. Ian Levine, a social studies teacher on my AB side, along with several teachers who recommended Vishal.

301
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:20,692
[SPEAKER_12]: He stood out by writing a very nice and long recommendation for Vishal.

302
00:23:20,752 --> 00:23:23,214
[SPEAKER_12]: So with him, I would like to give him some public credit for that.

303
00:23:23,654 --> 00:23:24,014
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

304
00:23:24,054 --> 00:23:24,235
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

305
00:23:31,105 --> 00:23:35,207
[SPEAKER_00]: When Principal Downs asked me about Project 351, I had not heard of it before.

306
00:23:35,888 --> 00:23:39,030
[SPEAKER_00]: Soon, however, I was fully registered for launch day.

307
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:47,955
[SPEAKER_00]: The coordinators kept in contact with myself and all of my fellow ambassadors, and after several informative emails and one conference call, I was ready for the big day.

308
00:23:48,535 --> 00:23:52,677
[SPEAKER_00]: I woke up early on the 19th and went to the centralized bus stop that had been assigned to me.

309
00:23:53,438 --> 00:23:55,239
[SPEAKER_00]: There, we were picked up by a regional bus.

310
00:23:56,417 --> 00:24:04,040
[SPEAKER_00]: When we reached Boston, the almost 400 ambassadors from all 351 towns and cities in Massachusetts gathered in Faneuil Hall.

311
00:24:04,701 --> 00:24:14,105
[SPEAKER_00]: There, for the launch of our day, we listened to several speeches from people like Governor Charlie Baker, First Lady Lauren Baker, and Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, among others.

312
00:24:14,965 --> 00:24:18,066
[SPEAKER_00]: After the ceremony, the ambassadors split up into large groups.

313
00:24:18,647 --> 00:24:22,048
[SPEAKER_00]: Each set of service hero groups are smaller organizational groups,

314
00:24:22,593 --> 00:24:24,434
[SPEAKER_00]: left to go to one of the service sites.

315
00:24:24,934 --> 00:24:32,197
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to the McKay School, where some service hero groups painted murals and others packaged thank you care packages for the staff of the school.

316
00:24:32,977 --> 00:24:39,039
[SPEAKER_00]: Other groups in different service sites helped with other projects, such as packaging food for the Greater Boston Food Bank.

317
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:43,761
[SPEAKER_00]: We spent two hours of our day working on these community service projects.

318
00:24:44,341 --> 00:24:49,463
[SPEAKER_00]: We reconvened later at Faneuil Hall, as we could not go to the Kennedy Library due to the government shutdown.

319
00:24:50,353 --> 00:24:55,474
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about our day of service, and ambassadors from every service site spoke about what was accomplished.

320
00:24:56,155 --> 00:24:59,716
[SPEAKER_00]: The regional buses then arrived, picked up their assigned students, and departed.

321
00:25:01,356 --> 00:25:06,778
[SPEAKER_00]: Launch Day was a chance for myself and all of the other ambassadors to meet people from all over the Commonwealth.

322
00:25:07,678 --> 00:25:10,679
[SPEAKER_00]: This means that we build connections from as far away as the Berkshires.

323
00:25:11,539 --> 00:25:14,180
[SPEAKER_00]: We can use these connections for advice from our peers.

324
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:18,661
[SPEAKER_00]: Launch Day also gives those in our communities opportunities for service.

325
00:25:19,263 --> 00:25:28,689
[SPEAKER_00]: In the Spring Service Project 351, we will donate to Cradles to Crayons, an organization that provides everyday necessities to children.

326
00:25:29,489 --> 00:25:39,815
[SPEAKER_00]: Students in the Andrews Middle School and the McGlynn Middle School that are members of the National Junior Honor Society or else participate in clubs like the CCSR can participate in this spring project.

327
00:25:40,415 --> 00:25:41,256
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone can serve.

328
00:25:41,716 --> 00:25:42,717
[SPEAKER_00]: We are just ambassadors.

329
00:25:53,607 --> 00:25:54,827
[SPEAKER_10]: So impressed, are we not?

330
00:25:55,548 --> 00:25:57,368
[SPEAKER_10]: Very, very impressed with both of you.

331
00:25:57,388 --> 00:25:59,129
[SPEAKER_10]: Amazing delivery.

332
00:25:59,829 --> 00:26:01,870
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm sure you learned a lot that day.

333
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:05,571
[SPEAKER_10]: Take it home and continue to be an ambassador in our community.

334
00:26:05,591 --> 00:26:06,811
[SPEAKER_10]: We look forward to it.

335
00:26:08,572 --> 00:26:11,813
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a motion on the floor to accept this report and place it on file?

336
00:26:11,853 --> 00:26:12,053
[SPEAKER_10]: Ms.

337
00:26:12,093 --> 00:26:13,794
[SPEAKER_10]: Mustone, seconded by Ms.

338
00:26:13,814 --> 00:26:14,394
[SPEAKER_10]: Vandeclude.

339
00:26:14,454 --> 00:26:15,174
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

340
00:26:15,814 --> 00:26:16,535
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

341
00:26:17,155 --> 00:26:17,955
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

342
00:26:18,935 --> 00:26:22,797
[SPEAKER_10]: The next item up is the report on Judge Klein's visit to our schools by Ms.

343
00:26:22,817 --> 00:26:23,197
[SPEAKER_10]: Caldwell.

344
00:26:26,642 --> 00:26:41,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Judge Sandra R. Kline, a federal bankruptcy court judge from Los Angeles, California, visited our grade 5 elementary and grade 8 students' girls on January 22nd and January 24th.

345
00:26:42,108 --> 00:26:48,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Judge Kline serves as a United States bankruptcy judge for the Central District of California.

346
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:55,673
[SPEAKER_05]: She has been committed to public service with a focus on educating, mentoring, and giving back to her community.

347
00:26:56,469 --> 00:27:01,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Originally from Medford, Judge Klein attended the Gleason, Hobbs, and Medford High School.

348
00:27:01,713 --> 00:27:05,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Her mom and dad still live here in Medford by Playstead Park.

349
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:08,178
[SPEAKER_05]: A quick hello to them, they're watching tonight.

350
00:27:09,579 --> 00:27:14,163
[SPEAKER_05]: The purpose of Judge Klein's visit was to empower and instill confidence in our girls.

351
00:27:14,884 --> 00:27:20,168
[SPEAKER_05]: She wanted them to know that they can do anything they want to if they work and study hard.

352
00:27:20,827 --> 00:27:29,251
[SPEAKER_05]: Judge Klein gave a brief summary of her background and explained different challenges that she had and how she overcame these challenges.

353
00:27:29,931 --> 00:27:34,393
[SPEAKER_05]: She wanted the students to think if she can do it, they can do it as well.

354
00:27:35,313 --> 00:27:39,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Judge Klein discussed going to school at UMass Lowell for music education

355
00:27:40,453 --> 00:27:44,456
[SPEAKER_05]: and then deciding to change her career and apply it to law school.

356
00:27:45,137 --> 00:27:54,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Her mom said to her, you know, I'm not sure you want to be a music education teacher, but you argue with me on a regular basis, so maybe you should go into law.

357
00:27:55,728 --> 00:27:59,170
[SPEAKER_05]: She wanted the students to know that life does not always go as planned.

358
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:05,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes there are roadblocks or setbacks, but if you persevere, you can accomplish your goals.

359
00:28:06,853 --> 00:28:07,053
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

360
00:28:07,093 --> 00:28:10,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Klein told the students to volunteer and not hold back.

361
00:28:10,635 --> 00:28:15,978
[SPEAKER_05]: She also stated, it is better to try and fail than to never have tried at all.

362
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:21,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Always put your best foot forward and try to be prepared for what comes your way.

363
00:28:21,769 --> 00:28:27,192
[SPEAKER_05]: She encouraged the girls to be kind, to hold a door for someone, greet people with a smile.

364
00:28:27,332 --> 00:28:29,813
[SPEAKER_05]: It could make a difference in someone's life.

365
00:28:30,753 --> 00:28:32,915
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the most important statements made by Ms.

366
00:28:32,955 --> 00:28:34,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Klein was to never give up.

367
00:28:35,196 --> 00:28:40,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes there are obstacles in your life, but keep focused and move forward towards your dreams.

368
00:28:40,958 --> 00:28:45,961
[SPEAKER_05]: The girls asked pertinent questions about what it's like to be a judge, what led her to California,

369
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,681
[SPEAKER_05]: and about her judicial responsibilities.

370
00:28:49,402 --> 00:28:54,745
[SPEAKER_05]: The presentation also instilled confidence and a sense of self-control in our girls.

371
00:28:55,485 --> 00:29:00,168
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to just read to you a few of the things that the students wrote to Judge Klein.

372
00:29:01,549 --> 00:29:03,550
[SPEAKER_05]: I left you with the biography as well.

373
00:29:05,486 --> 00:29:14,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Baraket Rumacab of the Andrews Middle School wanted you to know that it shouldn't matter, that Judge Klein said, it shouldn't matter what you have been through.

374
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:20,597
[SPEAKER_05]: What matters is how hard you work to achieve your dream and change your life for the better.

375
00:29:21,578 --> 00:29:27,683
[SPEAKER_05]: She just thought that Judge Klein was an amazing woman, an amazing role model for her.

376
00:29:28,223 --> 00:29:30,425
[SPEAKER_05]: This was the grade 8 Andrews School.

377
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:42,847
[SPEAKER_05]: We also had a fifth grade student at the Columbus School that wrote a letter to Judge Klein that said, thank you for taking time out of your day to visit the Columbus Elementary School.

378
00:29:43,505 --> 00:29:45,807
[SPEAKER_05]: We appreciate the talk that you had with us.

379
00:29:46,387 --> 00:29:51,531
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing I know that will stay with me is when you said that girls can do whatever boys can.

380
00:29:52,011 --> 00:29:58,556
[SPEAKER_05]: That inspired me to do any job I want to do, and I learned that there is no specific job for one gender.

381
00:29:59,377 --> 00:30:01,819
[SPEAKER_05]: You were an inspiration to me and others.

382
00:30:02,239 --> 00:30:05,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep doing what you're doing because it is amazing.

383
00:30:07,345 --> 00:30:15,712
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the students from the Roberts Elementary School had a question for Judge Klein, which was, if you could change a law, what would it be?

384
00:30:16,553 --> 00:30:20,537
[SPEAKER_05]: And Judge Klein thought about it, and she said, you know, I have to think about that for a little bit.

385
00:30:21,037 --> 00:30:25,921
[SPEAKER_05]: And just the other day, she sent me an email, and she said, please forward this to the student.

386
00:30:26,882 --> 00:30:33,565
[SPEAKER_05]: what I would do is make it a law that you can never do a government shutdown again.

387
00:30:34,805 --> 00:30:36,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it really impacted.

388
00:30:36,146 --> 00:30:43,389
[SPEAKER_05]: And when I listened to Vishal just talk to us about how we couldn't go to the JFK Library, that made me think of Judge Klein.

389
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:52,333
[SPEAKER_05]: And at this time, I am very, very proud to introduce to you a student from the Roberts Elementary School.

390
00:30:53,073 --> 00:30:55,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Her name is Angela Aurelian.

391
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:58,871
[SPEAKER_05]: She came to Medford from Haiti in September of 2018.

392
00:30:58,931 --> 00:31:01,431
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just a little bit ago.

393
00:31:02,392 --> 00:31:07,073
[SPEAKER_05]: She is in the fifth grade newcomers class at the Roberts Elementary School.

394
00:31:07,813 --> 00:31:12,654
[SPEAKER_05]: She speaks French, Creole, English, and a little bit of Spanish.

395
00:31:13,354 --> 00:31:16,295
[SPEAKER_05]: I am very proud to have her teacher with us, Ms.

396
00:31:16,335 --> 00:31:21,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Christine Hingston, thank you so much, and our director of EL, I noticed that Paul Texera,

397
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:22,981
[SPEAKER_05]: was here as well.

398
00:31:23,061 --> 00:31:24,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much for being here.

399
00:31:25,163 --> 00:31:29,727
[SPEAKER_05]: So at this time I'm going to let Angela tell you what she thought as well.

400
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:35,592
[SPEAKER_18]: My name is Angela Aurelian.

401
00:31:36,213 --> 00:31:39,116
[SPEAKER_18]: I am a fifth grade student from the Robert School.

402
00:31:40,257 --> 00:31:45,702
[SPEAKER_18]: I was lucky to hear Judge DeCline speaking with all the fifth grade girls.

403
00:31:46,713 --> 00:31:49,954
[SPEAKER_18]: That was the first time I saw a judge in real life.

404
00:31:51,014 --> 00:31:55,856
[SPEAKER_18]: I was excited and nervous, but it was fun to listen to a judge.

405
00:31:56,896 --> 00:32:01,758
[SPEAKER_18]: I learned that sometimes when you get a job, there are people who don't like you.

406
00:32:04,118 --> 00:32:05,619
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what happened to the judge.

407
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:08,240
[SPEAKER_18]: People were mean to her.

408
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,921
[SPEAKER_18]: She did not listen about what they said.

409
00:32:14,542 --> 00:32:15,802
[SPEAKER_18]: She did not care about that.

410
00:32:18,525 --> 00:32:24,449
[SPEAKER_18]: If you have a job to do, you do it and don't listen to people mean to you.

411
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:31,814
[SPEAKER_18]: At reset at home or school, don't let anybody make you sad because you have a heart.

412
00:32:33,635 --> 00:32:39,519
[SPEAKER_18]: Like the judge said, don't let mean people tell you what to do because you're special.

413
00:32:56,147 --> 00:32:59,128
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd also like to thank Angela's family that's here tonight.

414
00:32:59,168 --> 00:33:00,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much for coming.

415
00:33:00,509 --> 00:33:06,731
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure you're very proud of her.

416
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:09,632
[SPEAKER_05]: And Mr. Johnson, the principal of the Roberts School, is here as well.

417
00:33:09,652 --> 00:33:09,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

418
00:33:09,912 --> 00:33:10,372
[SPEAKER_10]: Excellent.

419
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:12,393
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you all for sharing in that.

420
00:33:12,793 --> 00:33:13,053
[SPEAKER_10]: I know Ms.

421
00:33:13,073 --> 00:33:14,393
[SPEAKER_10]: Vandekloot has something to say.

422
00:33:14,714 --> 00:33:17,835
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I just thank you to all of the students who came out tonight.

423
00:33:17,875 --> 00:33:19,415
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so nice to hear you.

424
00:33:19,755 --> 00:33:24,357
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would like if we could send to Judge Klein a thank you

425
00:33:25,205 --> 00:33:30,449
[SPEAKER_04]: note from the school committee thanking her for taking the time out of her schedule and coming back home.

426

[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

427
00:33:31,469 --> 00:33:32,090
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be great.

428
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:33,151
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure she would appreciate it.

429
00:33:33,171 --> 00:33:34,612
[SPEAKER_10]: Great things from some of the students.

430
00:33:34,672 --> 00:33:35,152
[SPEAKER_10]: Fabulous.

431
00:33:35,632 --> 00:33:36,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice job.

432
00:33:36,813 --> 00:33:37,594
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you everyone.

433
00:33:37,814 --> 00:33:38,214
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

434
00:33:38,234 --> 00:33:42,217
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a motion on the floor to receive and place this on file by Ms.

435
00:33:42,237 --> 00:33:43,878
[SPEAKER_10]: Kretz, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

436
00:33:43,918 --> 00:33:44,618
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

437
00:33:45,259 --> 00:33:45,879
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

438
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:46,700
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

439
00:33:48,188 --> 00:33:56,943
[SPEAKER_10]: And item four, recognition of Big Brothers Big Sisters of Greater Boston, volunteers from Tufts University and volunteers from Mystic Valley Elder Services.

440
00:33:57,464 --> 00:33:59,467
[SPEAKER_10]: Superintendent, Dr. Edward Vincent.

441
00:34:00,504 --> 00:34:12,494
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm really pleased to recognize the volunteers that have been working at all of our elementary schools, the work that they are giving of their time to give back to Medford and to our students.

442
00:34:13,194 --> 00:34:16,137
[SPEAKER_01]: And we wanted to take this opportunity to really recognize them.

443
00:34:16,597 --> 00:34:24,143
[SPEAKER_01]: I also want to thank Member McStone as well for really helping to coordinate today's effort.

444
00:34:25,424 --> 00:34:27,086
[SPEAKER_01]: First, I would like to recognize

445
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:34,207
[SPEAKER_01]: the members from the Big Brothers and Big Sisters organization, which is currently at the Roberts.

446
00:34:34,925 --> 00:34:36,365
[SPEAKER_01]: and the Columbus School.

447
00:34:36,806 --> 00:34:44,888
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is our hope, once the program has an opportunity to expand, that we would be able to expand it to all of our elementary schools.

448
00:34:45,688 --> 00:34:53,310
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, we have some certificates that we would like to recognize those of you who are here today.

449
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:58,671
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, our first recipient is Samuel Krexler.

[SPEAKER_10]: The Medford Public Schools is proud to recognize Samuel Kratzer with appreciation for your dedication and commitment to the students of Medford, from all of us.

452
00:35:23,854 --> 00:35:24,214
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

00:35:25,214 --> 00:35:28,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor Burke, if you could have the, maybe we could do a picture afterwards.

[SPEAKER_01]: Aiden Lewis.

459
00:36:46,311 --> 00:36:46,611
[SPEAKER_10]: Aiden?

460
00:36:47,912 --> 00:36:48,512
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, there's Aiden.

461
00:37:01,237 --> 00:37:02,798
Thank you so much, Andy.

462
00:37:02,858 --> 00:37:09,940
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a pleasure to meet you.

463
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:15,022
[SPEAKER_10]: So these big brothers and big sisters have committed to a year and a half with their littles, correct?

464
00:37:15,202 --> 00:37:15,922
[SPEAKER_10]: A year and a half.

465
00:37:16,462 --> 00:37:17,102
[SPEAKER_10]: Wonderful.

466
00:37:17,122 --> 00:37:17,943
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

467
00:37:23,064 --> 00:37:28,726
[SPEAKER_10]: We're also delighted to acknowledge the following people for volunteering at our schools through Mystic Valley Elder Services.

468
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:28,786
[SPEAKER_10]: Ms.

469
00:37:29,807 --> 00:37:30,727
[SPEAKER_10]: Charlene Powell.

470
00:37:35,347 --> 00:37:36,208
[SPEAKER_10]: Charlene Carl?

471
00:37:37,229 --> 00:37:37,830
[SPEAKER_10]: No, okay.

472
00:37:39,792 --> 00:37:46,740
[SPEAKER_10]: Rosalynn Weiss?

473
00:37:52,306 --> 00:37:54,028
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, we can come, yep.

474
00:38:18,935 --> 00:38:19,776
[SPEAKER_10]: Elizabeth Minnesian.

475
00:38:19,796 --> 00:38:34,992
[SPEAKER_10]: Elizabeth Minnesian.

476
00:38:35,052 --> 00:38:35,693
[SPEAKER_10]: Len Levin.

477
00:38:54,018 --> 00:38:55,138
[SPEAKER_10]: Teresa Invernone.

478
00:38:55,778 --> 00:38:56,579
[SPEAKER_10]: Invernone, meet.

479
00:38:58,879 --> 00:38:59,439
[SPEAKER_10]: Joyce Holt.

480
00:39:16,043 --> 00:39:23,044
[SPEAKER_22]: Linda, I don't mean to put you on the spot, but do you want to just say a few words so the community knows what your reading partners do with our students, please?

481
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:28,075
[SPEAKER_22]: Lender is the reading coordinator for Mystic Valley Elder Services.

482
00:39:29,196 --> 00:39:37,200
[SPEAKER_08]: So the reading partners, we ask volunteers that are 55 years and older to volunteer in schools.

483
00:39:37,881 --> 00:39:45,365
[SPEAKER_08]: And our focus is on reading, and I train them to help support kids that struggle with reading in the schools.

484
00:39:46,423 --> 00:39:52,846
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they go out to the schools and volunteer several hours a week, and they do it for the entire school year.

485
00:39:53,046 --> 00:39:53,587
[SPEAKER_08]: Wonderful.

486
00:39:53,707 --> 00:40:02,951
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much.

487
00:40:02,991 --> 00:40:03,451
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

488
00:40:03,471 --> 00:40:04,612
[SPEAKER_10]: Project 351 in action.

489
00:40:04,852 --> 00:40:05,412
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

490
00:40:05,472 --> 00:40:06,072
[SPEAKER_10]: Right?

491
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:06,673
[SPEAKER_10]: There it is.

492
00:40:06,693 --> 00:40:06,733
[SPEAKER_10]: Ms.

493
00:40:06,933 --> 00:40:11,155
[SPEAKER_10]: DiPenedo, can we take a picture with the volunteers?

494
00:40:11,315 --> 00:40:11,855
[SPEAKER_10]: Certainly.

495
00:40:11,875 --> 00:40:13,376
[SPEAKER_16]: And with the students from the community.

496
00:40:15,629 --> 00:40:16,149
[SPEAKER_10]: And Angela.

497
00:40:18,912 --> 00:40:23,115
[SPEAKER_10]: And anyone who wants to come up.

498
00:40:45,778 --> 00:40:52,680
Thank you very much.

499
00:41:14,658 --> 00:41:25,509
I'm taking them back out.

500
00:42:07,645 --> 00:42:13,309
[SPEAKER_10]: elementary principals that are in the audience and they're here to say thank you to you as well for all your efforts.

501
00:42:13,749 --> 00:42:18,112
[SPEAKER_10]: Mrs. Kaye, Ms.

502
00:42:18,152 --> 00:42:20,073
[SPEAKER_10]: Garino, Ms.

503
00:42:20,113 --> 00:42:21,954
[SPEAKER_10]: Galussi, and Mr. Johnson.

504
00:42:21,994 --> 00:42:23,936
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for being here supporting all of them.

505
00:42:23,956 --> 00:42:23,996
[SPEAKER_10]: Ms.

506
00:42:25,737 --> 00:42:25,997
Garino.

507
00:42:28,358 --> 00:42:28,759
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

508
00:42:30,097 --> 00:42:33,161
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a motion on the floor to accept this report and place it on file by Ms.

509
00:42:33,181 --> 00:42:33,481
[SPEAKER_10]: Kratz?

510
00:42:33,861 --> 00:42:34,542
[SPEAKER_10]: Seconded by Ms.

511
00:42:34,562 --> 00:42:35,043
[SPEAKER_10]: Vander Kloot.

512
00:42:35,063 --> 00:42:35,904
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

513
00:42:36,545 --> 00:42:37,406
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

514
00:42:37,546 --> 00:42:38,967
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes, thank you.

515
00:42:38,988 --> 00:42:42,572
[SPEAKER_10]: Item one, superintendent's update and comments.

516
00:42:44,754 --> 00:42:45,155
[SPEAKER_10]: Here you go.

517
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:50,921
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening, everyone.

518
00:42:50,941 --> 00:43:03,186
[SPEAKER_01]: A number of you have expressed interest in the wonderful work that was being done by Priscilla's Pantry, the free food pantry at Medford High School and the Medford Vocational Technical High School.

519
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:10,329
[SPEAKER_01]: The next lunch will be hosted this Wednesday, February 6th from 12 to 12.30 in Caf 3.

520
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:14,971
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a flyer in your folders with this information.

521
00:43:15,031 --> 00:43:16,632
[SPEAKER_01]: You are all welcome to attend.

522
00:43:17,848 --> 00:43:27,834
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition, Greta Smith, the nutrition specialist for the Medford Public Schools, provided me with the most updated data regarding students accessing the pantry.

523
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:36,279
[SPEAKER_01]: So on December 6th, three visitors went to the pantry and three bags were taken.

524
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:40,341
[SPEAKER_01]: On December 31st, it was also three and three.

525
00:43:41,262 --> 00:43:43,823
[SPEAKER_01]: On December 20th, there were 15 visitors and 15 bags.

526
00:43:47,285 --> 00:43:51,647
[SPEAKER_01]: On January 3rd, there were 11 visitors and 14 bags that were taken.

527
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:58,290
[SPEAKER_01]: On January 10th, there were 18 visitors, 26 bags that were taken.

528
00:43:59,830 --> 00:44:05,112
[SPEAKER_01]: On January 17th, there were 9 visitors and 11 bags that were taken.

529
00:44:06,333 --> 00:44:08,434
[SPEAKER_01]: And just last week, on January 24th,

530
00:44:09,628 --> 00:44:14,010
[SPEAKER_01]: there were 34 visitors and 40 bags were taken.

531
00:44:14,911 --> 00:44:22,635
[SPEAKER_01]: So the word is getting out and families are knowing that the food pantry is there as a support resource.

532
00:44:23,336 --> 00:44:34,762
[SPEAKER_01]: So the numbers have significantly increased from December 3rd of three visitors and three bags being taken to last week, 34 visitors and 40 bags being taken.

533
00:44:35,107 --> 00:44:41,069
[SPEAKER_10]: And we want to thank the YMCA for being the major moving party in this, as well as Mr. Hoff.

534
00:44:41,829 --> 00:44:43,850
[SPEAKER_10]: Priscilla's Pantry is named after his late wife.

535
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:46,990
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you for that.

536
00:44:49,651 --> 00:44:57,894
[SPEAKER_01]: So additionally, since we last met, I had the distinct pleasure to be asked to be a keynote speaker at the annual Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

537
00:44:57,934 --> 00:45:02,395
[SPEAKER_01]: Luncheon, hosted by the Mystic Valley NAACP, Mayor Burke,

538
00:45:03,061 --> 00:45:12,364
[SPEAKER_01]: Neil Osborne of the City's Diversity Office, the Medford Human Rights Commission, and the Medford Interfaith Clergy Association, and of course, St.

539
00:45:12,404 --> 00:45:13,305
[SPEAKER_01]: Raphael's Parish.

540
00:45:14,265 --> 00:45:30,051
[SPEAKER_01]: I spoke a little bit about the history of African Americans in the city of Medford, which goes back to approximately 1638, as well as my personal history, having grown up in West Medford, one of the oldest African American neighborhoods in the United States.

541
00:45:31,265 --> 00:45:39,849
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt like I had come full circle as I began my educational journey first at Hervey School for Kindergarten and then as a student at St.

542
00:45:39,909 --> 00:45:42,371
[SPEAKER_01]: Ray's for grades one through eight.

543
00:45:43,591 --> 00:45:57,098
[SPEAKER_01]: So many people came before me, paving the way for me as a first generation Haitian American to realize my dream to become superintendent of schools in my hometown of Medford.

544
00:45:58,509 --> 00:46:03,713
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. King had strong faith and urged all people to love your neighbor as yourself.

545
00:46:04,854 --> 00:46:06,636
[SPEAKER_01]: That definitely is a mantra of mine.

546
00:46:07,957 --> 00:46:15,763
[SPEAKER_01]: The night before the King luncheon on January 20th, the Patriots had won the AFC Championship.

547
00:46:16,463 --> 00:46:27,072
[SPEAKER_01]: And it resonated with me that day that if you fight the good fight and never give up until the clock reaches zero, you, we can all achieve victory.

548
00:46:28,837 --> 00:46:32,878
[SPEAKER_01]: At that time, the Patriots were underdogs for the AFC championship.

549
00:46:33,918 --> 00:46:35,719
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet, they came out on top.

550
00:46:37,199 --> 00:46:42,621
[SPEAKER_01]: And I shared, similarly, abolitionists and George Stearns, who was an abolitionist from Medford.

551
00:46:43,941 --> 00:46:45,482
[SPEAKER_01]: They were underdogs in their time.

552
00:46:46,462 --> 00:46:48,663
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet, in the end, they came out on top.

553
00:46:49,543 --> 00:46:56,605
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of their sacrifice and the work that they fought for, I am able to stand here before you as your superintendent.

554
00:46:57,696 --> 00:47:10,722
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm honored to have participated in that wonderful event, and I'd also like to recognize that school committee members, Paulette Vander Kloot, Kathy Krutz, and Paul Russo were all participants in that event as well.

555
00:47:11,182 --> 00:47:14,763
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Mayor, Mayor Burke, again, hosted it and was also a keynote speaker.

556
00:47:15,424 --> 00:47:16,344
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for that.

557
00:47:17,184 --> 00:47:17,544
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

558
00:47:19,302 --> 00:47:28,226
[SPEAKER_01]: On a different note, I just want to recognize the work that our Mustangs are doing, and that our Mustangs are doing pretty, I would say, outstanding work for this winter season.

559
00:47:28,626 --> 00:47:29,787
[SPEAKER_01]: They are really in good shape.

560
00:47:30,287 --> 00:47:45,073
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of our highlights include that yesterday, our Mustang, Tristan Howard, of the indoor track team, he won the Northeast Conference's 55-meter dash by completing the race in 6.6 seconds.

561
00:47:47,474 --> 00:47:54,218
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently, he is the fastest in Massachusetts and New England in this event.

562
00:48:00,181 --> 00:48:10,667
[SPEAKER_01]: He also finished first in the long jump, jumping an impressive 21 feet, and he had the fastest 200 meter time in the relay race.

563
00:48:11,927 --> 00:48:16,510
[SPEAKER_01]: Tristan also qualified for the state championships in four different events.

564
00:48:17,608 --> 00:48:23,172
[SPEAKER_01]: the 300-meter dash, the 55-meter dash, the shot put, and the long jump.

565
00:48:23,712 --> 00:48:24,833
[SPEAKER_01]: So great work, Tristan.

566
00:48:25,013 --> 00:48:25,513
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice job.

567
00:48:30,416 --> 00:48:41,864
[SPEAKER_01]: So our Lady Mustang basketball team won the annual Tufts University Cup versus Somerville, which was held last Sunday at Cousins Gym at Tufts University.

568
00:48:42,990 --> 00:48:55,174
[SPEAKER_01]: The boys basketball team have climbed and have made the MIAA State Tournament bid, and a highlight of their season to date was upsetting Everett, 57-56.

569
00:48:55,234 --> 00:49:04,638
[SPEAKER_01]: So one point victory, but we'll take it, a W for W. So we are very proud of all of our hardworking Mustang athletes.

570
00:49:07,257 --> 00:49:17,918
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition, Mr. Maloney, he asked that I extend an invitation to all of the school committee members for Saturday, February 16th at 3 p.m.

571
00:49:17,978 --> 00:49:18,859
[SPEAKER_01]: at Le Conte Rink.

572
00:49:19,966 --> 00:49:29,731
[SPEAKER_01]: Mayor Burke will be honoring the late John Welch for his many years of service and dedication to both the La Conte Rink and the citizens of Medford.

573
00:49:30,292 --> 00:49:36,635
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Welch was an educator in the Somerville Public Schools who lost his battle with ALS in December.

574
00:49:37,236 --> 00:49:40,037
[SPEAKER_01]: So save the date, Saturday, February 16th at 3 p.m.

575
00:49:40,057 --> 00:49:40,417
[SPEAKER_01]: La Conte Rink.

576
00:49:45,008 --> 00:49:53,253
[SPEAKER_01]: I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome Chef Ryan Echols from Project Bread to the Medford Public Schools.

577
00:49:54,134 --> 00:50:03,180
[SPEAKER_01]: Chef Echols, who works for Project Bread, started working at Medford High School to introduce some healthier and tastier meals to our students.

578
00:50:04,476 --> 00:50:09,920
[SPEAKER_01]: He will be at Medford High School until the end of March, when he'll move to the McGlynn K-8 school.

579
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:15,224
[SPEAKER_01]: He plans to work on skill development with our dedicated school food service staff.

580
00:50:16,727 --> 00:50:23,714
[SPEAKER_01]: The goal is to make sure that our staff feels comfortable preparing these meals when he moves on.

581
00:50:24,655 --> 00:50:33,744
[SPEAKER_01]: What Chef Eccles does is provide a sample of a menu item to students in one week and then offers that sample as a choice for lunch the following week.

582
00:50:34,605 --> 00:50:39,430
[SPEAKER_01]: This allows our students to try a wealth of different and healthy meal options.

583
00:50:40,067 --> 00:50:57,512
[SPEAKER_01]: Chef Eccles hails from California and previously served as a senior teaching assistant and lead chef at Mount Diablo High School in Concord, California, and a FoodWise Kids Instructor at the Center for Urban Education, Sustainable Agriculture

584
00:50:59,731 --> 00:51:00,712
[SPEAKER_01]: in San Francisco.

585
00:51:01,692 --> 00:51:09,578
[SPEAKER_01]: Chef Eccles attended the San Francisco Baking Institute in the College of Worcester in Ohio.

586
00:51:10,058 --> 00:51:17,684
[SPEAKER_01]: He is currently a part-time chef at Haley House in Boston, and we are pleased he will be serving the staff and students of Medford Public Schools.

587
00:51:19,805 --> 00:51:26,210
[SPEAKER_01]: I would also like to take this time to congratulate our senior Arden Ingersoll.

588
00:51:27,262 --> 00:51:39,890
[SPEAKER_01]: who plays the string bass and who, for the second year in a row, has been accepted to the Massachusetts All-State Orchestra, which will perform at Symphony Hall in Boston on March 2, 2019.

589
00:51:40,971 --> 00:51:51,497
[SPEAKER_01]: He was among 1,800 students who auditioned for the event, sponsored by the Massachusetts Music Educators Association at Shrewsbury High School on January 26.

590
00:51:53,596 --> 00:52:07,703
[SPEAKER_01]: Additionally, I'd also like to congratulate Medford High School freshman cellist Catherine Schmidt, who has been accepted to the prestigious Massachusetts Music Educators Association Northeast District Junior Festival.

591
00:52:08,243 --> 00:52:15,006
[SPEAKER_01]: Fewer than half of the more than 1,000 students who auditioned were selected to participate.

592
00:52:15,486 --> 00:52:21,309
[SPEAKER_01]: The festival concert will be held at the Galvin Middle School in Wakefield on March 31, 2019.

593
00:52:23,853 --> 00:52:25,674
[SPEAKER_01]: So congratulations to Catherine as well.

594
00:52:26,814 --> 00:52:32,316
[SPEAKER_01]: So this past weekend, our Mustangs once again participated in the Ethics Bowl.

595
00:52:33,376 --> 00:52:38,918
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the Ethics Bowl team won the New England Ethics Bowl at Tufts University.

596
00:52:39,738 --> 00:52:41,239
[SPEAKER_01]: So congratulations for that.

597
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:53,203
[SPEAKER_01]: So this debate style competition centered around 15 topical cases, which Medford has prepared for since September.

598
00:52:54,163 --> 00:53:02,828
[SPEAKER_01]: While they spend months preparing, they cannot bring anything with them to the competition, and their arguments must be given extemporaneously.

599
00:53:03,748 --> 00:53:12,953
[SPEAKER_01]: Once an argument is presented, the opposing team offers a rebuttal to which the team must respond, and this is followed up by a Q&A by the judges.

600
00:53:14,434 --> 00:53:18,076
[SPEAKER_01]: Teams are scored on the quality of their remarks in all three sections.

601
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:34,130
[SPEAKER_01]: Medford competed against Phillips Exeter Academy, our sort of arch rival, Phillips Andover Academy, Lexington High School, Noble and Greenoff, Boston University Academy, and the River School.

602
00:53:35,331 --> 00:53:43,096
[SPEAKER_01]: Medford defeated Phillips Exeter Academy in the semifinal round and then beat Noble and Greenoff in the final round.

603
00:53:43,857 --> 00:53:48,380
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the teams in attendance are ranked among the most elite schools in the country.

604
00:53:49,767 --> 00:53:55,671
[SPEAKER_01]: I really loved what their advisor, Eric Ensor, Medford High School English teacher said.

605
00:53:57,032 --> 00:54:06,419
[SPEAKER_01]: This win speaks to the caliber of the students here in Medford and the quality of the education they have received from the Medford public schools.

606
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:11,383
[SPEAKER_01]: I see it as an affirmation of public education as a whole.

607
00:54:13,062 --> 00:54:15,564
[SPEAKER_01]: The other regional was held in Purchase, New York.

608
00:54:16,345 --> 00:54:20,348
[SPEAKER_01]: So now Medford will compete virtually against the winner in a playoff.

609
00:54:21,188 --> 00:54:28,874
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoever wins will qualify to compete at the national competition in North Carolina at UMC Chapel Hill.

610
00:54:29,935 --> 00:54:35,359
[SPEAKER_01]: Medford attended the national competition there two years ago, where they finished 10th.

611
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:39,122
[SPEAKER_01]: For the third year in a row,

612
00:54:40,082 --> 00:54:54,091
[SPEAKER_01]: The trustees of the James and Thelma Connors Foundation are pleased to announce that the James and Thelma Connors Scholarship Fund application process is now open for the entire city of Medford students.

613
00:54:57,885 --> 00:55:05,250
[SPEAKER_01]: The scholarship fund will award up to 50 scholarships in the amount of $3,000 each to successful applicants.

614
00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:09,973
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the course of the past two years, over $219,000 has been distributed amongst Medford students.

615
00:55:14,347 --> 00:55:24,521
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Connors was a lifelong resident of Medford, who after his graduation from Medford High School, served in the United States Air Force during the Korean War.

616
00:55:25,121 --> 00:55:27,805
[SPEAKER_01]: When he returned, he worked in the trucking industry.

617
00:55:28,249 --> 00:55:31,571
[SPEAKER_01]: and also owned JC's lock and key service.

618
00:55:32,231 --> 00:55:37,654
[SPEAKER_01]: When he retired, Jim became a long time volunteer at the Lawrence Memorial Hospital.

619
00:55:38,354 --> 00:55:42,556
[SPEAKER_01]: Jim was known for always having a kind word and a smile for all.

620
00:55:43,337 --> 00:55:51,021
[SPEAKER_01]: When his sister Thelma passed away, Jim decided he'd like to establish a scholarship to assist Medford students.

621
00:55:51,871 --> 00:56:00,619
[SPEAKER_01]: Therefore, the James and Thelma Connors Foundation was developed and is now a 501c3 nonprofit private foundation.

622
00:56:01,239 --> 00:56:03,181
[SPEAKER_01]: Applications can be made online.

623
00:56:03,561 --> 00:56:09,066
[SPEAKER_01]: The website link is posted on our Medford Public Schools website and on the blog.

624
00:56:09,787 --> 00:56:15,512
[SPEAKER_01]: Application deadline is February 28th, so do not let that deadline pass you by.

625
00:56:17,285 --> 00:56:31,553
[SPEAKER_01]: So over the course of the past two weeks, my team and I, along with members of Lesley University, completed our second round of math learning walks, visiting the Brooks, the Columbus, the Roberts, and the McGlynn.

626
00:56:33,034 --> 00:56:44,341
[SPEAKER_01]: We visited classrooms to witness a 15-minute snapshot of instruction, where we looked for evidence of the five core actions, which are evidence-based responses,

627
00:56:45,270 --> 00:56:50,234
[SPEAKER_01]: academic discourse, productive struggle, access for all, and feedback.

628
00:56:51,295 --> 00:56:54,837
[SPEAKER_01]: We met as a group afterwards to debrief and record our findings.

629
00:56:55,718 --> 00:57:04,845
[SPEAKER_01]: The principals at each of the schools asked that we please leave our findings posted so that their teachers could review them at their convenience.

630
00:57:05,325 --> 00:57:09,208
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that data is being shared with all the schools, the elementary schools.

631
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:31,375
[SPEAKER_01]: Patricia Cren de Glarce, who is the Associate Dean of the Graduate School of Ed, as well as a director for the Center for Inclusive and Special Education at Lesley University, mentioned how she has already noticed and seen a difference in the quality of instruction since our first visit in September at the start of the school year.

632
00:57:31,754 --> 00:57:35,075
[SPEAKER_01]: and she has been accompanying me on all of the learning walks.

633
00:57:35,676 --> 00:57:50,722
[SPEAKER_01]: Additionally, for this second round, we had Dr. Hilary Kreisberg, who is the director and assistant professor of the Center for Mathematics Achievement from Lesley University, also weighing in and participating this last time in two of the learning walks.

634
00:57:51,763 --> 00:57:59,486
[SPEAKER_01]: I also want to note that we had participation from many of our other school leaders, not just the four elementary schools.

635
00:57:59,866 --> 00:58:01,187
[SPEAKER_01]: We had Headmaster DeLeva,

636
00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:19,949
[SPEAKER_01]: Principal Downs, Principal Tucci, Principal Toomey, our Director of Science, Rocco Sieri, Director of EL, Paul Textera, Director of Humanities, Dr. Nicole Chiesa, and Dr. Bernadette Riccadeli, our Director of Curriculum and Instruction for the district.

637
00:58:20,690 --> 00:58:21,971
[SPEAKER_01]: All of them were participating.

638
00:58:22,091 --> 00:58:24,252
[SPEAKER_01]: Our Associate Superintendent, Diane Caldwell,

639
00:58:24,806 --> 00:58:32,688
[SPEAKER_01]: have participated in learning walks throughout the year, but we have scaled up our work so that it can continue to grow within the district.

640
00:58:33,949 --> 00:58:47,993
[SPEAKER_01]: Lastly, on Friday, I had the opportunity to go to a wonderful winter fest at the McGlynn Elementary School, and it was an evening of fun games, music, fun and merriment hosted by their PTO.

641
00:58:48,687 --> 00:59:00,175
[SPEAKER_01]: And the parents braved the cold weather, if you remember how cold it was last Friday, and they braved the cold temperatures and went out to participate in the winter festival at the McGlynn School.

642
00:59:01,373 --> 00:59:06,017
[SPEAKER_01]: So the last closing notes, I want to give you three more calendar notes to keep in mind.

643
00:59:07,097 --> 00:59:16,204
[SPEAKER_01]: For our rising ninth graders, this Wednesday is going to be course selection at the high school from 7 to 8.30 p.m.

644
00:59:16,985 --> 00:59:28,053
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of our directors will be available in the library to provide support and answer questions for our rising ninth graders who are going to register for high school.

645
00:59:29,374 --> 00:59:29,795
[SPEAKER_01]: Vaping.

646
00:59:31,137 --> 00:59:37,519
[SPEAKER_01]: Our vaping professional session is coming up this week, What Parents Should Know and Hidden in Plain Sight.

647
00:59:38,059 --> 00:59:43,440
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna be presented this Thursday, February 7th at the McGlynn School at 5.30 p.m.

648
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:52,582
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a parent-guardian only event presented by the Medford Public Schools Health Department and the City of Medford's Prevention Office.

649
00:59:53,122 --> 01:00:00,544
[SPEAKER_01]: While this is being held, the McGlynn Middle School will be hosting a Valentine's Day dance that will begin at five o'clock for students.

650
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:17,140
[SPEAKER_01]: And this coming Saturday, the annual Valentine Festival, which is hosted by the Friends of the Medford Family Network, it's going to be held this Saturday from 11 to 1 at the McGlynn School Cafeteria.

651
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,880
[SPEAKER_01]: However, there's a special treat this year.

652
01:00:20,381 --> 01:00:31,644
[SPEAKER_01]: Please remember that prior to the festival in the McGlynn Auditorium, from 10 to 11 o'clock, there will be an opportunity to meet and greet all of the school committee members,

653
01:00:32,103 --> 01:00:33,044
[SPEAKER_01]: and all are welcome.

654
01:00:33,884 --> 01:00:34,084
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

655
01:00:37,727 --> 01:00:44,051
[SPEAKER_04]: I spoke with Marie Cassidy, and in fact, in the auditorium, the magician is going to need to set up.

656
01:00:44,452 --> 01:00:54,098
[SPEAKER_04]: So we need a different location for that at the McGlynn, perhaps in the library, someplace where we can put a poster up and let people know we're there.

657
01:00:54,539 --> 01:01:00,203
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, I think it would be advantageous if we had name tags for the committee members.

658
01:01:01,845 --> 01:01:02,265
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

659
01:01:02,365 --> 01:01:05,207
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for that, and that is my report for this week.

660
01:01:05,427 --> 01:01:05,847
[SPEAKER_10]: Very good.

661
01:01:05,887 --> 01:01:06,668
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much.

662
01:01:08,829 --> 01:01:12,951
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a motion to accept this report and place it on file by Mr. Russo, seconded by Ms.

663
01:01:12,992 --> 01:01:13,252
[SPEAKER_10]: Kretz?

664
01:01:13,272 --> 01:01:14,112
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

665
01:01:14,492 --> 01:01:14,612
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

666
01:01:14,733 --> 01:01:15,413
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

667
01:01:15,473 --> 01:01:16,273
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

668
01:01:17,414 --> 01:01:19,735
[SPEAKER_10]: Item 5, recommendation to approve field trip.

669
01:01:19,775 --> 01:01:22,637
[SPEAKER_10]: McGlynn and Andrews Middle School's trip to New York.

670
01:01:22,877 --> 01:01:26,399
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Tucci, Mr. Downs, and Michael DiClemente are here.

671
01:01:26,419 --> 01:01:30,502
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a motion to approve your field trips?

672
01:01:32,332 --> 01:01:33,493
[SPEAKER_10]: Come on, you've waited all evening.

673
01:01:33,973 --> 01:01:34,594
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you very much.

674
01:01:34,634 --> 01:01:35,355
[SPEAKER_23]: Good evening once again.

675
01:01:35,395 --> 01:01:43,021
[SPEAKER_23]: On behalf of the McGlynn Middle School, I'd like to present our proposal and answer any questions that you might have about our eighth grade student field trip to New York City.

676
01:01:43,843 --> 01:01:47,948
[SPEAKER_23]: The 8th grade trip to New York City has been an annual tradition since our school opened in 2001.

677
01:01:48,448 --> 01:01:54,054
[SPEAKER_23]: The Andrews M. McGlynn Middle School held a parent meeting in the fall where the New York City trip was introduced and questions were answered.

678
01:01:54,795 --> 01:01:58,179
[SPEAKER_23]: This year, 60 students have signed up for the trip from the McGlynn.

679
01:01:58,820 --> 01:02:04,947
[SPEAKER_23]: The cost of the trip is $595 per student with scholarships offered for financially challenged families.

680
01:02:06,237 --> 01:02:12,199
[SPEAKER_23]: The trip is scheduled for the weekend of June 7th through 9th with buses departing Friday, June 7th at 6 a.m.

681
01:02:12,939 --> 01:02:28,965
[SPEAKER_23]: The itinerary for the trip includes a visit to the Intrepid Sea Air Space Museum, Times Square, Top of the Rock, Museum of Natural History, the 9-11 Memorial, a production of Stomp, and a trip to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

682
01:02:29,966 --> 01:02:33,867
[SPEAKER_23]: Students remaining in school that Friday will participate in enrichment activities

683
01:02:34,317 --> 01:02:36,738
[SPEAKER_23]: that support curriculum and social development.

684
01:02:37,639 --> 01:02:48,765
[SPEAKER_23]: I'd like to acknowledge the work of McGlynn Middle School teacher and New York City Trip Advisor, Sherry Flint, who was unable to make it this evening for her hard work and attention to detail during the course of her efforts for this field trip.

685
01:02:48,985 --> 01:02:57,470
[SPEAKER_23]: Her work over the many years in this role has enabled hundreds of middle school students to have this once-in-a-lifetime experience with their teachers and their peers.

686
01:02:58,490 --> 01:03:08,335
[SPEAKER_23]: At this time, I'd like to turn it over to the Andrews Middle School principal, Mr. Downs, and Andrews Middle School teacher and advisor to the New York City Trip, Michael DiClemente, for their presentation for the Andrews Middle School.

687
01:03:08,616 --> 01:03:09,976
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

688
01:03:11,257 --> 01:03:11,997
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening again.

689
01:03:12,217 --> 01:03:13,138
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'll be very brief.

690
01:03:13,398 --> 01:03:18,581
[SPEAKER_12]: I just again want to publicly thank someone else tonight before I give it over to Mike DiClemente.

691
01:03:18,741 --> 01:03:20,482
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course, I want to thank Michael for being here.

692
01:03:21,134 --> 01:03:22,575
[SPEAKER_12]: I also want to thank our PTO.

693
01:03:22,815 --> 01:03:26,336
[SPEAKER_12]: Our PTO is behind our scholarships that we were able to give some students this year.

694
01:03:26,877 --> 01:03:36,461
[SPEAKER_12]: I also want to thank, I can't name them by name because they are anonymous, but there are members of this community who reached out to me to offer scholarships to students as well.

695
01:03:36,561 --> 01:03:40,783
[SPEAKER_12]: So those members, those people that are watching, I hope you know that I thank you dearly.

696
01:03:41,263 --> 01:03:44,125
[SPEAKER_12]: And those children are so very grateful to receive those scholarships.

697
01:03:44,725 --> 01:03:45,045
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

698
01:03:45,385 --> 01:03:45,785
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

699
01:03:46,005 --> 01:03:48,787
[SPEAKER_12]: And with no much more, I'm going to give it to Mr. D. Clemente.

700
01:03:50,834 --> 01:03:55,255
[SPEAKER_21]: In an effort not to be overly redundant, I'm really here just to answer questions.

701
01:03:55,896 --> 01:04:01,757
[SPEAKER_21]: I know last year and from the previous years, the idea was that no student would be left out who wanted to go on the trip.

702
01:04:02,558 --> 01:04:04,658
[SPEAKER_21]: There was no cap to how many kids could go.

703
01:04:05,499 --> 01:04:08,680
[SPEAKER_21]: I reached out to, as Mr. Downs said, to the PTO.

704
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:10,020
[SPEAKER_21]: They were happy to give some money.

705
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:11,320
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. Downs also reached out.

706
01:04:12,141 --> 01:04:16,122
[SPEAKER_21]: So all the kids who applied for money from the Andrews received money.

707
01:04:17,042 --> 01:04:20,965
[SPEAKER_21]: The PTO gave two full scholarships and four half scholarships.

708
01:04:21,625 --> 01:04:30,832
[SPEAKER_21]: And then through the other families that donated money, everyone who needed it got it so far and we're working with anyone else who might need it who comes to us privately.

709
01:04:30,892 --> 01:04:31,212
[SPEAKER_21]: I know Ms.

710
01:04:31,232 --> 01:04:32,213
[SPEAKER_21]: Satucci and Ms.

711
01:04:32,233 --> 01:04:36,456
[SPEAKER_21]: Flint have also worked out some plans to get people some money.

712
01:04:37,316 --> 01:04:43,561
[SPEAKER_21]: Also, just in an effort to make the trip as equitable as possible, we've met as a team through the middle

713
01:04:44,141 --> 01:04:51,908
[SPEAKER_21]: We're not doing the exact same trip where all 200 students are going to the same place at the same time, but we will be going to all the same places throughout the trip.

714
01:04:52,309 --> 01:04:54,971
[SPEAKER_21]: The differences would be where we go for dinner, just because Ms.

715
01:04:54,991 --> 01:04:59,916
[SPEAKER_21]: Flint had some ideas where she wanted to take her kids, and we've had some success at other places, so we've done that.

716
01:05:00,476 --> 01:05:03,399
[SPEAKER_21]: But the museums, the show, are the same.

717
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:05,161
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm happy to answer.

718
01:05:05,741 --> 01:05:07,262
[SPEAKER_21]: Any questions that you all may have?

719
01:05:07,302 --> 01:05:09,324
[SPEAKER_10]: How many students from the Andrews are taking up the spot?

720
01:05:09,344 --> 01:05:09,644
[SPEAKER_21]: 124 right now.

721
01:05:10,024 --> 01:05:12,146
[SPEAKER_21]: This is the biggest group I've been involved with.

722
01:05:12,626 --> 01:05:12,146
124.

723
01:05:12,686 --> 01:05:13,227
[SPEAKER_12]: Three buses.

724
01:05:13,487 --> 01:05:14,027
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

725
01:05:16,169 --> 01:05:16,949
[SPEAKER_10]: That's fabulous.

726
01:05:17,730 --> 01:05:18,551
[SPEAKER_10]: Three buses or?

727
01:05:18,991 --> 01:05:21,433
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, we had to extend to a third bus this year.

728
01:05:21,673 --> 01:05:22,714
[SPEAKER_21]: Like I said, we don't cap it.

729
01:05:23,734 --> 01:05:25,296
[SPEAKER_21]: So we extended to a third bus.

730
01:05:25,376 --> 01:05:26,937
[SPEAKER_21]: And some of the prices went up.

731
01:05:26,957 --> 01:05:30,319
[SPEAKER_21]: That's why the trip is more expensive, obviously, than it's been in the past.

732
01:05:30,399 --> 01:05:33,762
[SPEAKER_21]: But we try to work our best to keep it as low as possible.

733
01:05:34,362 --> 01:05:34,722
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

734
01:05:34,742 --> 01:05:34,983
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Russo.

735
01:05:35,959 --> 01:05:39,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, and thanks for hitting a lot of the questions I had before I got to them.

736
01:05:40,283 --> 01:05:43,105
[SPEAKER_02]: So how many students potentially could go with the McGlynn?

737
01:05:46,348 --> 01:05:48,930
[SPEAKER_23]: We have two buses going at this point in time, and I believe each bus holds 55.

738
01:05:49,370 --> 01:05:51,832
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, how many students are eligible to go?

739
01:05:52,893 --> 01:05:54,775
[SPEAKER_23]: The entire eighth grade class is eligible to go.

740
01:05:54,935 --> 01:05:56,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, we have- Can you not make me look that up, or do you know it?

741
01:05:57,257 --> 01:05:59,318
[SPEAKER_23]: I know it's about 164 students- Thank you.

742
01:05:59,338 --> 01:06:04,303
[SPEAKER_23]: At this point in time, and we have 60 students that have signed up at this point in time to go.

743
01:06:05,422 --> 01:06:06,303
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Andrews?

744
01:06:12,226 --> 01:06:16,809
[SPEAKER_12]: Right now we have about 165 eighth graders, and we have 124 going.

745
01:06:18,770 --> 01:06:34,600
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I guess I'm just, the Andrews numbers are pretty amazing, and I'm glad that we have been able to find money for kids that need it so they can go, but I'm sure everybody can recognize those ratios are not anywhere

746
01:06:35,780 --> 01:06:44,085
[SPEAKER_21]: Similar I mean just to speak to that just a bit just from my history with it We generally hit about 50% of the eighth graders for the Andrews.

747
01:06:44,125 --> 01:07:01,555
[SPEAKER_23]: This is an outlier I mean just just to kind of speak to that And the number at the McGlynn is Consistent with the amount of students that have gone in past years from what I've gathered to as well So this number is very consistent with past years a participation rate to as well at the school I

748
01:07:05,653 --> 01:07:05,873
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

749
01:07:07,174 --> 01:07:07,914
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Benedetto.

750
01:07:08,354 --> 01:07:08,814
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

751
01:07:09,655 --> 01:07:13,677
[SPEAKER_09]: I see your concerns, my colleagues' concerns.

752
01:07:13,737 --> 01:07:20,900
[SPEAKER_09]: We just want to make sure that there is no reason that any student's not participating.

753
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:28,303
[SPEAKER_09]: I also worry about the small group that's going to be left at the Andrews and what they'll be doing with their time.

754
01:07:28,623 --> 01:07:32,445
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's a weekend trip, but on that Friday, as long as they don't

755
01:07:33,058 --> 01:07:40,240
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, is that community everybody's been reached out to to make sure that they're welcome to go on the trip?

756
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:58,405
[SPEAKER_12]: At this time we were still finalizing exactly who the chaperones are going to be and then of course we have to find coverage for all those people that are chaperoning and if we are able to find a chaperone or two we are going to try to do a day trip in conjunction again with the PTO for those students that are not going.

757
01:07:59,262 --> 01:07:59,542
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

758
01:08:01,002 --> 01:08:02,523
[SPEAKER_09]: My other question is insurance.

759
01:08:02,903 --> 01:08:04,343
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't see it listed here.

760
01:08:04,383 --> 01:08:04,923
[SPEAKER_09]: Insurance.

761
01:08:06,304 --> 01:08:08,144
[SPEAKER_09]: As part of the fee involved.

762
01:08:09,545 --> 01:08:14,486
[SPEAKER_09]: We did have to cancel one of these trips at one point because of things going on in the world.

763
01:08:15,066 --> 01:08:20,327
[SPEAKER_09]: And as a committee, we voted to make sure that parents didn't lose money and the district helped out.

764
01:08:20,707 --> 01:08:27,209
[SPEAKER_09]: But we made it so that way every trip from that point on had to cover insurance in case that were to happen.

765
01:08:27,745 --> 01:08:33,369
[SPEAKER_23]: And my understanding is, too, as well, the company that we're working through right now has property damage insurance as a part of the trip.

766
01:08:33,849 --> 01:08:41,674
[SPEAKER_23]: So, in fact, we do have a report that we can share with you, too, as well, that's pretty detailed in terms of the level of insurance that's provided by this company.

767
01:08:41,814 --> 01:08:57,063
[SPEAKER_09]: So for cancellation, if the school committee decides that it's for any reason not safe to send our children to another state as that trip comes closer, that is covered, and the parents will receive all of their money back?

768
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:03,332
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, that's a question we can get back to you if you don't mind.

769
01:09:03,592 --> 01:09:03,872
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

770
01:09:03,912 --> 01:09:07,133
[SPEAKER_23]: With regards to whether or not we'll be able to recoup any costs.

771
01:09:07,473 --> 01:09:10,334
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it might add to the ultimate cost of every child.

772
01:09:10,354 --> 01:09:11,475
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a separate policy.

773
01:09:12,015 --> 01:09:12,235
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

774
01:09:12,315 --> 01:09:19,818
[SPEAKER_09]: But it is a policy to make sure that that is added to every trip, because we had to cancel at one point.

775
01:09:20,078 --> 01:09:24,580
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was a financial hardship for some parents to lose their deposits.

776
01:09:25,420 --> 01:09:28,081
[SPEAKER_09]: And the school system did step up in that occasion.

777
01:09:30,571 --> 01:09:36,932
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you need this approval tonight, or could you get us those answers before we approve this?

778
01:09:37,612 --> 01:09:42,553
[SPEAKER_09]: Or we can approve it and just make sure that that policy is adhered to.

779
01:09:43,494 --> 01:09:45,794
[SPEAKER_23]: Certainly, we'll be sure to get you that answer, just to confirm it.

780
01:09:45,814 --> 01:09:45,994
[SPEAKER_10]: OK, great.

781
01:09:46,034 --> 01:09:46,254
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

782
01:09:46,274 --> 01:09:48,135
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a motion on the floor for approval by Ms.

783
01:09:48,155 --> 01:09:48,775
[SPEAKER_10]: DiVenitato.

784
01:09:48,835 --> 01:09:49,575
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a second?

785
01:09:49,595 --> 01:09:49,655
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

786
01:09:51,415 --> 01:09:51,775
[SPEAKER_10]: By Ms.

787
01:09:51,815 --> 01:09:52,255
[SPEAKER_10]: Kretz.

788
01:09:52,595 --> 01:09:53,136
[SPEAKER_10]: Roll call.

789
01:09:53,156 --> 01:09:54,396
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, Mr. Russo, question.

790
01:09:54,836 --> 01:09:55,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

791
01:09:57,516 --> 01:10:00,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Just for the school committee's information,

792
01:10:00,838 --> 01:10:09,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it possible to survey the students that are not going with a simple two or three or four options as to why they're not going?

793
01:10:10,621 --> 01:10:15,203
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can know, is it really that the school committee needs to find money to fix this?

794
01:10:18,203 --> 01:10:23,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it that kids just don't want to go, which I leave that out as an option, although I was a kid once.

795
01:10:23,965 --> 01:10:26,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, their parents don't want to go.

796
01:10:26,367 --> 01:10:27,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Or their parents don't.

797
01:10:27,127 --> 01:10:27,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

798
01:10:27,368 --> 01:10:31,029
[SPEAKER_02]: There can be lots of reasons, but I'd like to know that it's not money.

799
01:10:31,069 --> 01:10:34,191
[SPEAKER_02]: And I struggle when I see the difference between the two schools.

800
01:10:34,331 --> 01:10:42,355
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know the SES status of each of the schools to not conclude that the McGlynn is sending fewer kids because they can't afford it.

801
01:10:42,375 --> 01:10:48,318
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to say that without evidence, but I'm pretty comfortable saying it anyways.

802
01:10:50,078 --> 01:10:53,442
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Hsu, our school committee representative from Medford High School.

803
01:10:53,582 --> 01:10:58,968
[SPEAKER_19]: I will say that when I went, I'd say there were about 70 kids who went in my year.

804
01:10:59,569 --> 01:11:01,912
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know exactly how many 8th graders there were at the time.

805
01:11:02,693 --> 01:11:07,218
[SPEAKER_19]: And the consensus was kind of like, it's a cool trip and it would be cool to go.

806
01:11:08,197 --> 01:11:09,898
[SPEAKER_19]: But some people just didn't want to go.

807
01:11:10,258 --> 01:11:13,820
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe they had sports that interfered, family events.

808
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:17,482
[SPEAKER_19]: I know a lot of people had one big birthday party they were going to.

809
01:11:18,642 --> 01:11:22,484
[SPEAKER_19]: And it wasn't so much that kids couldn't go, but it's just they didn't want to.

810
01:11:23,184 --> 01:11:25,125
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's my take on it, from at least my year.

811
01:11:25,985 --> 01:11:26,706
[SPEAKER_19]: Geez, how long was that?

812
01:11:27,346 --> 01:11:27,866
[SPEAKER_19]: Four years ago?

813
01:11:27,886 --> 01:11:28,507
[SPEAKER_10]: Four years ago?

814
01:11:29,507 --> 01:11:30,508
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

815
01:11:30,588 --> 01:11:31,788
[SPEAKER_19]: Things have changed since then, I'm sure.

816
01:11:31,848 --> 01:11:34,590
[SPEAKER_19]: But that's just my personal take on it.

817
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:34,970
[SPEAKER_14]: Very good.

818
01:11:34,990 --> 01:11:35,230
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

819
01:11:37,850 --> 01:11:42,693
[SPEAKER_21]: I can at least answer from an advisor point of view that both I and Ms.

820
01:11:42,733 --> 01:11:49,938
[SPEAKER_21]: Flint have made perfectly clear multiple times to the students that tell us that you want to go.

821
01:11:51,197 --> 01:11:53,038
[SPEAKER_21]: and we will make sure that you can go.

822
01:11:54,338 --> 01:12:03,262
[SPEAKER_21]: I know I've gone down to the various lunches just to make sure, like, there is money available if you want to go, sign up, and kids took the opportunity to do that.

823
01:12:03,762 --> 01:12:09,224
[SPEAKER_21]: I would say just off the cuff, people who don't go, it's probably 70 percent a family decision.

824
01:12:09,825 --> 01:12:10,885
[SPEAKER_21]: They don't want the kids to leave.

825
01:12:10,905 --> 01:12:12,506
[SPEAKER_21]: They don't want the kids in New York where

826
01:12:13,705 --> 01:12:15,907
[SPEAKER_21]: Something, God forbid, could happen.

827
01:12:16,587 --> 01:12:22,391
[SPEAKER_21]: And the rest of it is probably just tied up with various other obligations, sports and the like.

828
01:12:23,352 --> 01:12:24,553
[SPEAKER_21]: But again, that's just off the cuff.

829
01:12:24,573 --> 01:12:25,794
[SPEAKER_21]: That's not scientific.

830
01:12:27,035 --> 01:12:27,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.

831
01:12:27,535 --> 01:12:33,899
[SPEAKER_02]: I did have one other quick question around... Oh, my gosh.

832
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:34,900
[SPEAKER_02]: I did have a question.

833
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:35,520
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gone.

834
01:12:36,541 --> 01:12:37,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, thank you.

835
01:12:37,622 --> 01:12:38,663
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll probably email one of you later.

836
01:12:38,683 --> 01:12:39,283
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

837
01:12:40,484 --> 01:12:41,665
[SPEAKER_10]: Roll call vote, please.

838
01:12:47,826 --> 01:12:48,087
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

839
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:50,687
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

840
01:12:50,767 --> 01:12:52,148
[SPEAKER_10]: Six in the affirmative, one absent.

841
01:12:52,668 --> 01:12:53,448
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

842
01:12:53,468 --> 01:12:54,008
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

843
01:12:54,168 --> 01:12:54,668
[SPEAKER_10]: Have fun.

844
01:12:54,688 --> 01:12:55,108
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

845
01:12:55,148 --> 01:12:57,789
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

846
01:12:57,809 --> 01:12:58,709
[SPEAKER_10]: We have another one, I think.

847
01:12:59,049 --> 01:12:59,790
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Tucci?

848
01:12:59,930 --> 01:13:00,110
[SPEAKER_10]: No?

849
01:13:01,150 --> 01:13:02,790
[SPEAKER_10]: Recommendation to approve field trips.

850
01:13:02,830 --> 01:13:06,031
[SPEAKER_10]: Seventh grade environmental trip to the University of Rhode Island.

851
01:13:06,131 --> 01:13:07,372
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Tucci, Ms.

852
01:13:07,412 --> 01:13:07,832
[SPEAKER_10]: Haas.

853
01:13:08,112 --> 01:13:08,352
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi.

854
01:13:08,892 --> 01:13:09,872
[SPEAKER_10]: And Angela, Ms.

855
01:13:09,892 --> 01:13:10,352
[SPEAKER_10]: Bellini.

856
01:13:10,672 --> 01:13:11,333
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't believe she's here.

857
01:13:11,393 --> 01:13:11,513
[SPEAKER_10]: Ms.

858
01:13:11,573 --> 01:13:12,653
[SPEAKER_23]: Bellini's not able to come tonight.

859
01:13:13,643 --> 01:13:21,468
[SPEAKER_23]: But I do have with me here Rocco Sieri, the Director of Science, and also Patty Haas, who is a seventh grade science teacher at the McGlynn Middle School.

860
01:13:22,049 --> 01:13:22,789
[SPEAKER_23]: So good evening once again.

861
01:13:22,829 --> 01:13:31,175
[SPEAKER_23]: On behalf of the McGlynn Middle School, I'd like to present our proposal and answer any questions you might have about our seventh grade student field trip to the Alton Jones Environmental Overnight Field Trip.

862
01:13:32,316 --> 01:13:42,863
[SPEAKER_23]: With 2,300 acres of lakes, forests, and farmlands, the W. Alton Jones campus offers an immense outdoor classroom that's perfect for learning, exploration, adventure, and fun.

863
01:13:44,193 --> 01:13:51,399
[SPEAKER_23]: At W. Alton Jones, students gain an understanding and appreciation of the natural world while learning about themselves and working collaboratively with others.

864
01:13:52,039 --> 01:14:03,589
[SPEAKER_23]: Their fun-filled activities-based program are designed with the students in mind, and this trip will get students excited about learning while enhancing their classroom work with hands-on first-person experiences.

865
01:14:04,504 --> 01:14:08,570
[SPEAKER_23]: The 7th grade trip to this environmental camp has been an annual tradition for many years at the school.

866
01:14:09,191 --> 01:14:17,724
[SPEAKER_23]: This year we anticipate, based upon surveying by teachers and previous years' data, that approximately 80 students may attend the trip.

867
01:14:18,750 --> 01:14:26,755
[SPEAKER_23]: The cost of the trip will be somewhere in the range of $180 to $200 per student, with scholarships offered for financially challenged situations.

868
01:14:27,496 --> 01:14:36,202
[SPEAKER_23]: The cost is dependent on how successful our fundraising efforts also are, because we're going to put a considerable amount of efforts with some winter activities nights in order to raise some money.

869
01:14:36,862 --> 01:14:41,085
[SPEAKER_23]: The trip is scheduled for Monday, May 6, and it will go into Tuesday, May 7.

870
01:14:42,306 --> 01:14:45,648
[SPEAKER_23]: And before I answer any questions, I do want to acknowledge the work of McGlynn Middle School teachers,

871
01:14:46,178 --> 01:14:59,527
[SPEAKER_23]: and Environmental Trip Organizers, Patty Haas, who's here with me this evening to answer any questions, and Angela Bellini, who's not able to come tonight, but they both have put in a tremendous amount of hard work over the years on this trip and have told me about the wonderful experiences the students have had.

872
01:14:59,887 --> 01:15:11,615
[SPEAKER_23]: In fact, last year, when I first came into the school, I had the opportunity to see the students come back from the trip with amazing experiences out in the country, and they were able to put that good use to work in the classroom, too, as well.

873
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:14,697
[SPEAKER_23]: So Patty's also here to answer any questions that you might have.

874
01:15:15,303 --> 01:15:16,824
[SPEAKER_23]: And I would be here as well with Rocco.

875
01:15:17,225 --> 01:15:17,985
[SPEAKER_23]: So thank you very much.

876
01:15:18,385 --> 01:15:19,086
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

877
01:15:19,406 --> 01:15:20,187
[SPEAKER_10]: Are there any questions?

878
01:15:20,827 --> 01:15:21,408
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Benedetto.

879
01:15:21,448 --> 01:15:22,588
[SPEAKER_10]: A motion to approve.

880
01:15:23,369 --> 01:15:27,612
[SPEAKER_09]: This field trip's been going on for years and years.

881
01:15:28,373 --> 01:15:34,477
[SPEAKER_09]: It's great for our students to get out in the environment and to do some science hands-on.

882
01:15:35,298 --> 01:15:37,680
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's a great learning opportunity.

883
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:44,885
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, I would like to make sure that all students have the opportunity to take part in it, regardless of

884
01:15:45,506 --> 01:15:51,510
[SPEAKER_09]: of their financial situations, and I make a motion at this time to approve and move forward.

885
01:15:51,530 --> 01:15:56,493
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a motion on the floor to accept, adopt, approve this field trip.

886
01:15:57,474 --> 01:15:57,714
[SPEAKER_10]: Ms.

887
01:15:57,934 --> 01:15:58,415
[SPEAKER_10]: Van de Kloet.

888
01:15:59,856 --> 01:16:00,556
[SPEAKER_04]: I seconded it.

889
01:16:00,936 --> 01:16:02,137
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, you didn't have a question.

890
01:16:02,237 --> 01:16:09,622
[SPEAKER_04]: The only other thing I would say is please keep us abreast of when there are fundraisings for this so that we can participate.

891
01:16:11,223 --> 01:16:11,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

892
01:16:11,604 --> 01:16:11,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Russo.

893
01:16:13,915 --> 01:16:16,076
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a question more for the committee than anybody.

894
01:16:16,556 --> 01:16:22,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we require that the transportation our students use on field trips, that the transportation has seat belts?

895
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:30,403
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think so.

896
01:16:30,763 --> 01:16:31,124
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

897
01:16:31,164 --> 01:16:33,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if it's not our policy right now, I guess it's not time to bring it up.

898
01:16:35,308 --> 01:16:37,412
[SPEAKER_23]: So this would be a coach bus that would be transporting the students.

899
01:16:37,992 --> 01:16:40,797
[SPEAKER_23]: And you know, Eastern Bus does not have seatbelts on.

900
01:16:40,837 --> 01:16:44,102
[SPEAKER_10]: Very good.

901
01:16:44,142 --> 01:16:45,725
[SPEAKER_23]: I do not think coach buses do as well.

902
01:16:46,747 --> 01:16:48,269
[SPEAKER_23]: Unless it's a specialized type of vehicle.

903
01:16:48,549 --> 01:16:49,932
[SPEAKER_23]: But I do not believe that's the case in this one.

904
01:16:50,348 --> 01:16:52,650
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a motion on the floor for approval by Mr. Vendetto.

905
01:16:52,690 --> 01:16:53,391
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a second?

906
01:16:53,871 --> 01:16:55,373
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a second by Ms.

907
01:16:55,533 --> 01:16:55,713
[SPEAKER_10]: Ham.

908
01:16:55,773 --> 01:16:56,093
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

909
01:16:56,974 --> 01:16:58,516
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been a long day.

910
01:16:59,477 --> 01:17:01,358
[SPEAKER_10]: Roll call vote, please.

911
01:17:01,559 --> 01:17:01,779
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

912
01:17:06,063 --> 01:17:06,303
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

913
01:17:08,765 --> 01:17:09,026
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

914
01:17:09,086 --> 01:17:10,387
[SPEAKER_10]: Six in the affirmative, one absent.

915
01:17:10,407 --> 01:17:11,248
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion's approved.

916
01:17:11,448 --> 01:17:11,768
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

917
01:17:11,888 --> 01:17:12,449
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, everyone.

918
01:17:12,469 --> 01:17:13,330
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

919
01:17:13,570 --> 01:17:13,930
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Ms.

920
01:17:13,990 --> 01:17:14,110
[SPEAKER_10]: Haas.

921
01:17:16,213 --> 01:17:21,063
[SPEAKER_10]: Item 7, recommendation to approve donation to Roberts Elementary School, Mr. Johnson.

922
01:17:21,083 --> 01:17:25,873
[SPEAKER_10]: Would you like me to read it?

923
01:17:28,303 --> 01:17:31,024
[SPEAKER_10]: The Roberts Elementary School received a donation from Ms.

924
01:17:31,064 --> 01:17:34,145
[SPEAKER_10]: Christina Damari, parent of a kindergartner and third grader.

925
01:17:34,205 --> 01:17:38,727
[SPEAKER_10]: She donated 51 pairs of headphones, purchased at a cost of $5 each.

926
01:17:39,127 --> 01:17:42,268
[SPEAKER_10]: The total donation was $255 to the school.

927
01:17:42,848 --> 01:17:47,950
[SPEAKER_10]: We truly appreciate this generous donation, and this contribution has benefited a number of students at the Roberts.

928
01:17:48,931 --> 01:17:49,731
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Johnson.

929
01:17:49,751 --> 01:17:50,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, good evening.

930
01:17:51,271 --> 01:17:52,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Kurt Johnson, Roberts School Principal.

931
01:17:52,652 --> 01:17:55,053
[SPEAKER_03]: So as Mayor Burke mentioned, that Ms.

932
01:17:55,073 --> 01:17:55,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Damari

933
01:17:55,942 --> 01:18:06,025
[SPEAKER_03]: parent of two of our students at Robert's School donated 51 pairs of headsets to our computer lab, with a total cost of $255 donated to the school this past month.

934
01:18:06,045 --> 01:18:06,745
[SPEAKER_10]: Very nice.

935
01:18:06,845 --> 01:18:07,365
[SPEAKER_10]: Very nice.

936
01:18:07,385 --> 01:18:09,906
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a motion for approval?

937
01:18:09,966 --> 01:18:10,166
[SPEAKER_10]: Ms.

938
01:18:10,206 --> 01:18:11,667
[SPEAKER_10]: Kretz, did you have a question?

939
01:18:12,087 --> 01:18:17,288
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like the school committee to send a letter of thanks to the DeMari family.

940
01:18:18,029 --> 01:18:19,509
[SPEAKER_10]: It's customary now.

941
01:18:21,150 --> 01:18:21,590
[SPEAKER_10]: Second.

942
01:18:22,230 --> 01:18:22,570
[SPEAKER_10]: Second.

943
01:18:25,051 --> 01:18:25,411
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

944
01:18:25,961 --> 01:18:26,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

945
01:18:26,664 --> 01:18:27,446
[SPEAKER_10]: Congratulations.

946
01:18:27,687 --> 01:18:28,951
[SPEAKER_10]: Gentlemen, thank you in person.

947
01:18:33,059 --> 01:18:35,980
[SPEAKER_10]: Item 8, recommendation to approve donation from Impact Church.

948
01:18:36,140 --> 01:18:36,340
[SPEAKER_10]: Ms.

949
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:37,201
[SPEAKER_10]: Patterson.

950
01:18:38,361 --> 01:18:38,922
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening.

951
01:18:40,122 --> 01:18:46,825
[SPEAKER_06]: The Impact Church would like to donate funds to replace the outdated auditorium lighting at the McGlynn School.

952
01:18:47,385 --> 01:18:53,848
[SPEAKER_06]: This donation would enrich the arts and theater programs at the McGlynn by having a permanently fixed modern lighting system.

953
01:18:54,468 --> 01:18:58,070
[SPEAKER_06]: So we are requesting quotes from different vendors.

954
01:18:58,130 --> 01:18:58,810
[SPEAKER_06]: I've received

955
01:18:59,695 --> 01:19:01,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Two so far, we're waiting for the third.

956
01:19:02,197 --> 01:19:05,580
[SPEAKER_06]: And the estimated value of the donation is between $13,000 and $15,000.

957
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:11,004
[SPEAKER_06]: So we would be very fortunate to receive this gift.

958
01:19:11,444 --> 01:19:17,268
[SPEAKER_10]: And they recently made a donation of $10,000 earlier this year.

959
01:19:17,448 --> 01:19:18,589
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, wonderful.

960
01:19:19,110 --> 01:19:24,254
[SPEAKER_10]: It is recommended to accept the identified donation for use and purposes of enrichment at the McGlynn School.

961
01:19:24,914 --> 01:19:25,314
[SPEAKER_10]: Correct.

962
01:19:25,334 --> 01:19:27,276
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a motion for approval?

963
01:19:29,297 --> 01:19:29,697
[SPEAKER_10]: by Ms.

964
01:19:29,737 --> 01:19:32,179
[SPEAKER_10]: Kretz, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

965
01:19:32,219 --> 01:19:32,840
[SPEAKER_10]: Roll call vote.

966
01:19:34,001 --> 01:19:34,681
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Russo.

967
01:19:36,162 --> 01:19:37,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Was this at the Andrews or the McGlynn?

968
01:19:37,664 --> 01:19:38,064
[SPEAKER_10]: McGlynn.

969
01:19:38,144 --> 01:19:38,464
[SPEAKER_10]: McGlynn.

970
01:19:38,544 --> 01:19:38,945
[SPEAKER_10]: Auditorium.

971
01:19:38,965 --> 01:19:39,545
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you say Andrews?

972
01:19:39,565 --> 01:19:40,746
[SPEAKER_10]: Auditorium, said McGlynn.

973
01:19:41,026 --> 01:19:41,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry.

974
01:19:41,967 --> 01:19:45,169
[SPEAKER_02]: I was hearing you say Andrews, and I'm like, OK, sorry.

975
01:19:45,229 --> 01:19:45,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

976
01:19:45,710 --> 01:19:46,470
[SPEAKER_15]: Roll call vote, please.

977
01:19:46,510 --> 01:19:48,012
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Benedetto.

978
01:19:48,292 --> 01:19:48,392
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

979
01:19:48,432 --> 01:19:48,532
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

980
01:19:48,592 --> 01:19:48,832
[SPEAKER_15]: Kretz.

981
01:19:48,852 --> 01:19:48,932
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

982
01:19:48,952 --> 01:19:49,393
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Williams.

983
01:19:49,433 --> 01:19:49,553
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

984
01:19:49,573 --> 01:19:49,653
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

[SPEAKER_15]: Jarrett.

986
01:19:49,913 --> 01:19:50,113
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

988
01:19:50,634 --> 01:19:50,934
[SPEAKER_15]: Rosas.

989
01:19:50,954 --> 01:19:51,014
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

990
01:19:55,188 --> 01:19:56,930
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, 6 in the affirmative, 1 absent.

991
01:19:57,330 --> 01:19:58,912
[SPEAKER_10]: The approval is on.

992
01:19:59,092 --> 01:19:59,513
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

993
01:20:00,154 --> 01:20:02,677
[SPEAKER_10]: Item 9, report on fundraising organizations.

994
01:20:02,937 --> 01:20:03,137

[SPEAKER_10]: Patron.

997
01:20:06,741 --> 01:20:07,042
[SPEAKER_10]: Good night.

998
01:20:16,407 --> 01:20:22,152
[SPEAKER_20]: So I included an addendum document on your desks.

999
01:20:22,472 --> 01:20:33,242
[SPEAKER_20]: So we have been reaching out to all the 501c3 organizations that we're aware of and trying to keep track of everybody that is on file with the Attorney General's office.

1000
01:20:33,802 --> 01:20:35,784
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm happy to answer any questions you have.

1001
01:20:37,201 --> 01:20:44,745
[SPEAKER_20]: starting next year in October, a form will be distributed that I have created instead of kind of carrying over what was happening last year.

1002
01:20:45,385 --> 01:20:47,026
[SPEAKER_20]: And then I'll report every February.

1003
01:20:47,626 --> 01:20:49,847
[SPEAKER_20]: But this is what we have so far.

1004
01:20:49,867 --> 01:20:51,548
[SPEAKER_20]: It was being updated as of today.

1005
01:20:51,668 --> 01:20:54,670
[SPEAKER_20]: So any questions you all have, I'm happy to address.

1006
01:20:55,630 --> 01:20:56,291
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Benedetto.

1007
01:20:56,731 --> 01:20:57,111
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1008
01:20:57,811 --> 01:21:00,833
[SPEAKER_09]: First of all, I would like to thank you very much for putting this together.

1009
01:21:01,353 --> 01:21:04,035
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it was just added to your duties recently.

1010
01:21:05,195 --> 01:21:06,796
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's a lot of non-

1011
01:21:07,744 --> 01:21:32,635
[SPEAKER_09]: PTO 5013Cs that aren't listed here, like Friends of Baseball, Friends of Soccer, Friends of those, all of those organizations raise money using Method Public Schools' name, and they're required, based on what this committee voted on, to, in order to be able to do that, is to register.

1012
01:21:34,171 --> 01:21:39,375
[SPEAKER_09]: have we reached out to those groups, and if so, have they answered us at all?

1013
01:21:40,196 --> 01:21:48,121
[SPEAKER_20]: I have reached out to every 501c3 that I was able to find, either by word of mouth or via the Attorney General's website.

1014
01:21:48,642 --> 01:21:55,607
[SPEAKER_20]: If they're a genuine 501c3, they have to do their filings with the Attorney General, so all of that information is online.

1015
01:21:55,707 --> 01:22:02,272
[SPEAKER_20]: If they're not, if they haven't applied to be a 501c3, which is a really complicated process, so it's possible that they are collecting money

1016
01:22:02,849 --> 01:22:10,856
[SPEAKER_20]: as an organization and giving to student activities for particular projects, but they may not be a true 501c3.

1017
01:22:11,156 --> 01:22:13,699
[SPEAKER_20]: So the things that I was able to find are listed here.

1018
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:24,368
[SPEAKER_20]: But again, also, this report should sort of serve as an announcement that anybody who is raising money as a 501c3 should be reporting to me, and I'm the contact person.

1019
01:22:24,448 --> 01:22:28,472
[SPEAKER_20]: And the report also has my contact info, if they can let us know.

1020
01:22:28,884 --> 01:22:34,606
[SPEAKER_10]: perhaps offline if there are names and possibly addresses of contact people that we should provide.

1021
01:22:36,207 --> 01:22:41,790
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, what type of information other than what's right in front of us are we collecting?

1022
01:22:41,810 --> 01:22:51,214
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I know the superintendent, I'm not sure if she was here when the original, it was an online form developed.

1023
01:22:51,774 --> 01:22:55,775
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if you've received that and that's what we're currently using.

1024
01:22:57,638 --> 01:23:03,583
[SPEAKER_09]: areas of who's the head of your organization, who's the president, who's the vice president?

1025
01:23:03,723 --> 01:23:05,865
[SPEAKER_09]: Are we getting all of that information from these?

1026
01:23:06,466 --> 01:23:08,387
[SPEAKER_09]: As well as, do you have a bank account?

1027
01:23:08,467 --> 01:23:09,648
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's on the bank account?

1028
01:23:09,708 --> 01:23:12,351
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, we wanted specific details.

1029
01:23:12,371 --> 01:23:14,753
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't know if that's been provided.

1030
01:23:18,037 --> 01:23:26,621
[SPEAKER_20]: It's owner is a person who's outside of the school system, so I'm recreating a form that's gonna be within just the Medford Public Schools.

1031
01:23:28,641 --> 01:23:36,084
[SPEAKER_20]: So that form was sent out, and I received some of the things back from that form that were requested, but not always everything.

1032
01:23:36,665 --> 01:23:46,789
[SPEAKER_20]: And part of the reason for that, I think, is that it asked for a lot of heavily detailed stuff, and the people that do these are volunteers, but it doesn't mean that we can't access that information if they're a 501c3.

1033
01:23:47,890 --> 01:23:52,314
[SPEAKER_20]: They do all their financial reporting to the Attorney General's office, and that's all public record.

1034
01:23:52,414 --> 01:23:55,236
[SPEAKER_20]: So we do have access to that.

1035
01:23:55,376 --> 01:24:01,641
[SPEAKER_20]: So everything isn't listed here, but I'm going to have a database, and it's kind of updated on an ongoing basis.

1036
01:24:02,162 --> 01:24:07,966
[SPEAKER_20]: Additionally, every year a lot of these organizations change leadership, so that's why the reporting is going to happen every October.

1037
01:24:07,986 --> 01:24:10,308
[SPEAKER_20]: So it will always be kind of in flux.

1038
01:24:11,690 --> 01:24:20,817
[SPEAKER_09]: So what about the organizations raising money using Method Public Schools that aren't, that haven't done the 5013Cs?

1039
01:24:21,878 --> 01:24:22,619
[SPEAKER_09]: How will we?

1040
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:27,983
[SPEAKER_10]: She would only know if someone tells her.

1041
01:24:28,223 --> 01:24:32,286
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, authorize those groups to raise money using our names.

1042
01:24:32,887 --> 01:24:39,232
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that, you know, there was this legitimate concern for the development of this project.

1043
01:24:40,127 --> 01:24:49,094
[SPEAKER_06]: So if I may interject, we have two different scenarios where we have the 501c3s that are strictly their own tax ID.

1044
01:24:49,254 --> 01:24:53,117
[SPEAKER_06]: They run for fundraising under that purpose.

1045
01:24:53,197 --> 01:24:55,059
[SPEAKER_06]: We do not have jurisdiction over them.

1046
01:24:55,479 --> 01:25:02,525
[SPEAKER_06]: We cannot formally demand or require certain documentation from them, again, because they supply it to the attorney general's office.

1047
01:25:02,865 --> 01:25:05,647
[SPEAKER_06]: We have notification of names and information.

1048
01:25:06,027 --> 01:25:09,330
[SPEAKER_06]: The other category that you are inquiring about is truly

1049
01:25:09,881 --> 01:25:12,023
[SPEAKER_06]: under the auspice of student activities.

1050
01:25:12,403 --> 01:25:16,966
[SPEAKER_06]: So within each school, there are certain activities that are run.

1051
01:25:17,407 --> 01:25:23,191
[SPEAKER_06]: The high school has the majority of the student activities that have, they are considered a sub-account.

1052
01:25:23,732 --> 01:25:29,676
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a separate checking and savings account for each student activity at every school.

1053
01:25:30,217 --> 01:25:32,178
[SPEAKER_06]: We did the authorization last year.

1054
01:25:32,238 --> 01:25:37,262
[SPEAKER_06]: We updated the requirements for the replenishment that needed to be

1055
01:25:37,853 --> 01:25:46,579
[SPEAKER_06]: identified, so the elementary schools have $5,000 within their access to the checking account, the middle schools have $10,000, and the high school has $25,000.

1056
01:25:47,179 --> 01:25:49,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything is processed through the warrant.

1057
01:25:50,021 --> 01:26:00,909
[SPEAKER_06]: The receipts are deposited through their student activity savings, and the warrant replenishes that, which is what you see on your bills and payrolls that begin with the code 890.

1058
01:26:01,549 --> 01:26:06,733
[SPEAKER_06]: So those funds are being turned over as their activities are taking place.

1059
01:26:08,028 --> 01:26:16,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Mary Jo identifies through separate sub-accounts, but again, it's under the one umbrella, the auspice of the student activities.

1060
01:26:16,832 --> 01:26:20,253
[SPEAKER_06]: These are not separate 501c3 organizations or entities.

1061
01:26:20,293 --> 01:26:31,618
[SPEAKER_06]: They're doing small projects based on the club or such as the National Honor Society, Fine Arts Club, things of that sort.

1062
01:26:32,019 --> 01:26:42,790
[SPEAKER_06]: and those are all being deposited through their student activity accounts and replenished as such and that the checks are identified through the warrant and those are audited annually by the outside auditor.

1063
01:26:46,534 --> 01:26:46,654
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

1064
01:26:46,694 --> 01:26:48,096
[SPEAKER_11]: DiBenedetto, did you want to follow up?

1065
01:26:48,436 --> 01:26:48,776
[SPEAKER_11]: No, Ms.

1066
01:26:48,877 --> 01:26:50,678
[SPEAKER_11]: DiBenedetto brought up the soccer.

1067
01:26:50,919 --> 01:26:53,762
[SPEAKER_11]: I have at least 10 right now

1068
01:26:54,595 --> 01:27:02,276
[SPEAKER_11]: sport teams from Medford High School that I received their deposits and processed their checks.

1069
01:27:02,356 --> 01:27:08,337
[SPEAKER_11]: And the secretaries who have worked will see those bills come through the checks written with all the backup.

1070
01:27:09,018 --> 01:27:11,958
[SPEAKER_11]: So soccer is one that I do have funds for.

1071
01:27:12,018 --> 01:27:14,258
[SPEAKER_11]: Girls hockey, basketball, cheering.

1072
01:27:14,699 --> 01:27:22,620
[SPEAKER_11]: Now that doesn't mean to say there could be other things as well, but those particular items that we manage for student activities,

1073
01:27:23,608 --> 01:27:47,442
[SPEAKER_11]: The money comes into me, and it is deposited, and if there's questions, I have Christine to be able to question if I think they're using the funds inappropriately, and anyone that's ever signed the bills, and there's been a number of you here who have, if Mrs. Vandekl was at the high school, so she could come to me and say, hey, I just want to understand why are we buying food for the bus, and it's for the hockey team.

1074
01:27:47,942 --> 01:27:52,286
[SPEAKER_11]: The girls ride long trips, and they buy food for the buses, and the parents raise that money.

1075
01:27:52,686 --> 01:27:55,808
[SPEAKER_11]: So that was just one interesting example, because it's an odd thing.

1076
01:27:55,828 --> 01:27:58,150
[SPEAKER_11]: You think, why are we buying food for the bus?

1077
01:27:58,190 --> 01:28:00,152
[SPEAKER_11]: But we're buying food for the bus because we travel.

1078
01:28:00,692 --> 01:28:07,978
[SPEAKER_09]: My question is, so say a coach decides to run a three-week-long camp.

1079
01:28:08,558 --> 01:28:09,639
[SPEAKER_09]: You can pay at the door.

1080
01:28:09,659 --> 01:28:11,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Does that go through community schools?

1081
01:28:11,541 --> 01:28:12,822
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that going through this?

1082
01:28:14,043 --> 01:28:15,684
[SPEAKER_09]: How are we regulating these funds?

1083
01:28:17,359 --> 01:28:22,423
[SPEAKER_09]: I see it on Facebook all the time, oh, we're running this event, come and pay at the door cash.

1084
01:28:22,643 --> 01:28:29,889
[SPEAKER_09]: And like, is that money going through the school district or is it going to that subgroup and how will we manage?

1085
01:28:30,049 --> 01:28:38,096
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just too big of an opportunity for money to be used differently than what intended.

1086
01:28:38,636 --> 01:28:41,839
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, it's dependent on what is booked.

1087
01:28:43,522 --> 01:28:51,565
[SPEAKER_06]: a camp within the school district, yes, that would be a community schools event that we would collect and that would go through the community schools revolving account.

1088
01:28:51,985 --> 01:29:04,110
[SPEAKER_06]: If it was a basketball tournament or camp that the basketball team was running for their youth within the different categories, then that could be a student activity.

1089
01:29:04,450 --> 01:29:10,952
[SPEAKER_06]: We would have to look at what the building's use was for particular areas and see to determine what

1090
01:29:11,362 --> 01:29:14,804
[SPEAKER_06]: what program they were actually collecting for and into.

1091
01:29:15,064 --> 01:29:25,089
[SPEAKER_06]: But we do have the building schedules for each location, and that would tie back to whatever event that they were running and would be able to determine which funding source it was going through.

1092
01:29:25,849 --> 01:29:39,056
[SPEAKER_09]: So when I see, oh, you can pay at the door, like, there's a lot of cash being handled at the door if there's, you know, 60 kids coming to, you know,

1093
01:29:40,763 --> 01:29:55,570
[SPEAKER_09]: a training for a day with specific coaches, and then, like, wouldn't that be the community school's desk that that fund should be going out of and not necessarily up at the door by... No, again, so there's different mechanisms.

1094
01:29:55,610 --> 01:30:02,593
[SPEAKER_06]: Depending on which organization is actually funding or hosting the event, it would be done through their coffers.

1095
01:30:02,633 --> 01:30:07,595
[SPEAKER_06]: So if it's going through student activities, they make the deposit directly, the funds are held within

1096
01:30:08,573 --> 01:30:12,416
[SPEAKER_06]: the locked business office location until they are deposited through City Hall.

1097
01:30:12,816 --> 01:30:19,801
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's a 501c3 that's doing, they would be depositing within their own bank accounts and under their tax ID.

1098
01:30:20,341 --> 01:30:26,265
[SPEAKER_06]: So there would be separate determining processes based on which program was offering the event.

1099
01:30:29,687 --> 01:30:37,853
[SPEAKER_09]: So what had happened, and most of you had known this, but I'm not sure the superintendent did, is that people were

1100
01:30:38,529 --> 01:30:42,892
[SPEAKER_09]: charging our students for private lessons.

1101
01:30:43,933 --> 01:30:50,037
[SPEAKER_09]: And instead of paying our school district to use the building, they were paying the Friends of account.

1102
01:30:51,738 --> 01:30:54,500
[SPEAKER_09]: So the facilities were being used.

1103
01:30:56,801 --> 01:31:03,666
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can't speak to what has happened prior, past, but in terms of what we're doing now, we have been making

1104
01:31:05,928 --> 01:31:08,409
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we've taken very big strides in cleaning that up.

1105
01:31:08,469 --> 01:31:11,689
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a very successful audit within our student activities.

1106
01:31:12,029 --> 01:31:20,191
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we've demonstrated the validity of the scheduling and how much is actually identified within each school.

1107
01:31:21,151 --> 01:31:22,672
[SPEAKER_06]: So, we are documenting.

1108
01:31:22,872 --> 01:31:30,714
[SPEAKER_06]: If there is something that has come through or that we don't know, then at that time I'm happy to answer on a particular item.

1109
01:31:33,122 --> 01:31:45,027
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know of a situation that's occurred recently in that context, but that we are making every precaution to safeguard the funds that should be going through the school deposits.

1110
01:31:45,447 --> 01:31:47,128
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe we need a list.

1111
01:31:47,168 --> 01:31:48,349
[SPEAKER_09]: The schedules are reviewed.

1112
01:31:48,429 --> 01:31:53,911
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, but also maybe we need a list of the activities groups so we have a clear picture of like, okay,

1113
01:31:54,284 --> 01:31:55,625
[SPEAKER_09]: So these are activities groups.

1114
01:31:55,685 --> 01:31:57,445
[SPEAKER_09]: Those funds go through this way.

1115
01:31:57,605 --> 01:31:57,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Certainly.

1116
01:31:57,946 --> 01:32:01,487
[SPEAKER_09]: These are our 501 groups, and their funds go this way.

1117
01:32:01,847 --> 01:32:09,310
[SPEAKER_09]: And maybe we should see how that works, like, annually, just like, so we know how much funds are coming in, going out.

1118
01:32:09,650 --> 01:32:11,411
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just want to tighten it up.

1119
01:32:11,551 --> 01:32:18,714
[SPEAKER_09]: I just don't want to go, I don't want what happened in the past to either continue or to happen again.

1120
01:32:18,734 --> 01:32:20,675
[SPEAKER_09]: It was, you know,

1121
01:32:21,278 --> 01:32:26,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I can assure that our audit requirements and processes have tightened it up.

1122
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:41,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, I can't speak to what happened prior, but we will gladly provide a list of the sub-accounts and the groups that we have that are currently earning for student activity categories.

1123
01:32:42,284 --> 01:32:44,304
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll put that in our reports too, please.

1124
01:32:44,384 --> 01:32:44,584
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1125
01:32:45,405 --> 01:32:45,625
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1126
01:32:48,010 --> 01:32:48,330
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1127
01:32:48,350 --> 01:32:51,691
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that this is bigger than we can just discuss here.

1128
01:32:52,031 --> 01:32:59,272
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe this is a committee of the whole to, like, come up with, like, policies and procedures for people being able to collect money.

1129
01:32:59,812 --> 01:33:01,773
[SPEAKER_09]: We do have policies in place.

1130
01:33:02,653 --> 01:33:03,013
[SPEAKER_06]: We do.

1131
01:33:03,393 --> 01:33:05,033
[SPEAKER_06]: We've already established that last year.

1132
01:33:05,233 --> 01:33:13,975
[SPEAKER_06]: We did provide that, and that's why it's clear in terms of the replenishment and the levels that each school can maintain in particular accounts.

1133
01:33:16,293 --> 01:33:18,734
[SPEAKER_06]: brand new banking accounts for all of them.

1134
01:33:18,854 --> 01:33:20,175
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a checking and a savings.

1135
01:33:20,215 --> 01:33:29,460
[SPEAKER_06]: These were identified as the audit recommendations, which we did implement, and we brought forward as the school committee's approval for that practice.

1136
01:33:29,480 --> 01:33:33,202
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have already identified and committed to that process.

1137
01:33:33,422 --> 01:33:33,802
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1138
01:33:34,503 --> 01:33:35,163
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Russo.

1139
01:33:36,644 --> 01:33:36,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1140
01:33:38,265 --> 01:33:42,867
[SPEAKER_02]: My concerns were slightly different, although those made a lot of sense to me.

1141
01:33:44,088 --> 01:34:09,079
[SPEAKER_02]: The other area, or 503C, 501C3, that I'm concerned about is Big Club International, Big Brothers Big Sisters, Kiwanis, you name it, names that do not have Medford in them and that are truly much bigger than Medford, that do things in Medford for Medford kids, spend their money on Medford public schools,

1142
01:34:11,515 --> 01:34:15,836
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know how much they spent on us, and we don't know how much they collected in our name.

1143
01:34:16,537 --> 01:34:20,898
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, their money comes from somewhere, fundraising drives.

1144
01:34:21,718 --> 01:34:29,141
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's sort of like all the cancer organizations that always have pediatrics.

1145
01:34:29,741 --> 01:34:32,942
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always raising money for kids, even though most of the money doesn't go to kids.

1146
01:34:33,922 --> 01:34:37,443
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to know that these organizations aren't collecting $100,000 a year in Medford from Medford people.

1147
01:34:40,708 --> 01:34:42,269
[SPEAKER_02]: and then spending $5,000 a year.

1148
01:34:42,950 --> 01:34:44,531
[SPEAKER_10]: But how do we know that?

1149
01:34:44,571 --> 01:34:54,417
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that was why they were supposed to also, if they are collecting in our- Yeah, but we have to find, they've searched, like Emily's searched 501C3s for Medford organizations.

1150
01:34:54,437 --> 01:34:58,300
[SPEAKER_02]: But those organizations are going to come forward and make a donation to our school.

1151
01:34:58,900 --> 01:35:04,724
[SPEAKER_02]: We shouldn't allow a donation to our school from any organization, from an individual's different, from any organization.

1152
01:35:05,725 --> 01:35:12,128
[SPEAKER_02]: that just miraculously finds money to give us, they got it from somewhere and they probably raised it using Medford's name.

1153
01:35:12,968 --> 01:35:16,350
[SPEAKER_06]: The larger entities such as the Red Cross would not be doing that.

1154
01:35:16,610 --> 01:35:28,556
[SPEAKER_06]: If they made a donation for families in Medford, I don't see why that would be a concern of ours, but we do accept all of the donations that come into the schools.

1155
01:35:29,997 --> 01:35:35,119
[SPEAKER_06]: So we do share that and we get a vote for approval and acceptance of any type of

1156
01:35:35,664 --> 01:35:40,027
[SPEAKER_06]: donation from a corporation from any independent.

1157
01:35:40,407 --> 01:35:47,911
[SPEAKER_06]: So in terms of the large corporations, no, they are not fundraising on behalf of Medford Public Schools.

1158
01:35:48,752 --> 01:35:53,475
[SPEAKER_06]: If they were to make a donation, we would vote to accept that donation.

1159
01:35:53,815 --> 01:35:56,957
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as they're not fundraising in our name.

1160
01:35:57,677 --> 01:36:03,621
[SPEAKER_02]: And then giving back a smaller portion than what they've raised.

1161
01:36:04,060 --> 01:36:05,421
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how to know that.

1162
01:36:05,822 --> 01:36:11,746
[SPEAKER_06]: The intent of the law indicates that you have to provide your source and use when you are fundraising for that purpose.

1163
01:36:12,067 --> 01:36:16,270
[SPEAKER_06]: So if the Red Cross is fundraising, they would have to state that.

1164
01:36:16,490 --> 01:36:25,698
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't believe that they would fundraise for any single independent group, that they fundraise on a national and or global scale.

1165
01:36:26,218 --> 01:36:32,764
[SPEAKER_06]: And where they decide to expend their resources, a check would be distributed and or services provided.

1166
01:36:33,615 --> 01:36:40,277
[SPEAKER_06]: As such, a check would be delivered here for acceptance in that regard.

1167
01:36:40,297 --> 01:36:42,177
[SPEAKER_10]: Ms.

1168
01:36:42,237 --> 01:36:43,777
[SPEAKER_10]: Danikluk, did you still wish to speak?

1169
01:36:44,137 --> 01:36:44,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, please.

1170
01:36:45,358 --> 01:36:50,379
[SPEAKER_04]: On the list from the Attorney General, there's Medford Field of Dreams is listed.

1171
01:36:52,959 --> 01:36:55,600
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had an interesting relationship with the Field of Dreams.

1172
01:36:56,396 --> 01:36:58,879
[SPEAKER_04]: That one is not, does not show up on our list.

1173
01:36:59,239 --> 01:37:07,107
[SPEAKER_20]: I was just basing it on what I was, what I was told by other folks that knew about these organizations or things that seemed clearly connected to the schools.

1174
01:37:07,167 --> 01:37:09,389
[SPEAKER_20]: Again, this is sort of an ongoing document.

1175
01:37:09,469 --> 01:37:18,498
[SPEAKER_20]: So if you know, so like I wouldn't have known that Medford Field of Dreams was connected to the schools and I guess that it wasn't, but I'm happy to add that and follow up with them.

1176
01:37:18,918 --> 01:37:20,460
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure whether they're

1177
01:37:21,295 --> 01:37:22,976
[SPEAKER_04]: collecting any money right now or?

1178
01:37:23,376 --> 01:37:24,156
[SPEAKER_04]: That's okay, yeah.

1179
01:37:24,297 --> 01:37:26,398
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm keeping the list whether they're collecting money or not.

1180
01:37:27,038 --> 01:37:27,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1181
01:37:27,338 --> 01:37:27,998
[SPEAKER_20]: But yeah, definitely.

1182
01:37:28,038 --> 01:37:40,205
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, I hope that this is sort of an announcement that if people do know about 501c3s or any of these listed that I didn't include that you think do a lot of work directly with the schools, please let me know and we can kind of collaborate.

1183
01:37:40,845 --> 01:37:43,947
[SPEAKER_10]: Perhaps you could print the 990 for that entity.

1184
01:37:44,387 --> 01:37:44,587
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

1185
01:37:44,747 --> 01:37:45,847
[SPEAKER_10]: And see if there's any activity.

1186
01:37:45,867 --> 01:37:48,649
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a feeling it's defunct and probably for many years.

1187
01:37:49,557 --> 01:37:53,398
[SPEAKER_10]: Similar, one of the ones I asked you about was Medford After School Program.

1188
01:37:54,098 --> 01:37:56,499
[SPEAKER_10]: That has had no activity and it's been idle.

1189
01:37:56,579 --> 01:38:00,160
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a process to close out a non-profit.

1190
01:38:00,200 --> 01:38:02,181
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a really complicated process.

1191
01:38:02,401 --> 01:38:03,961
[SPEAKER_10]: The courts actually have to bless it.

1192
01:38:04,261 --> 01:38:04,822
[SPEAKER_10]: It's bizarre.

1193
01:38:08,003 --> 01:38:13,384
[SPEAKER_04]: The other question I had I think really reflects, I had expected a much longer list.

1194
01:38:13,924 --> 01:38:16,025
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's really the friends of

1195
01:38:17,505 --> 01:38:27,688
[SPEAKER_04]: all of those ones that you were alluding to earlier that would make sense for us to have a list of two, understanding that those are not 501c3s.

1196
01:38:28,229 --> 01:38:30,469
[SPEAKER_20]: But I didn't necessarily... It's a very long list.

1197
01:38:30,509 --> 01:38:34,831
[SPEAKER_20]: So Mary Jo has its hundreds just at the high school?

1198
01:38:35,031 --> 01:38:43,914
[SPEAKER_11]: The high school has over 65 or 70 columns in my student activity Excel spreadsheet that has over $200,000 in that account.

1199
01:38:47,265 --> 01:38:50,908
[SPEAKER_11]: as Christine says, with money, checkbook, and the rest in savings.

1200
01:38:51,629 --> 01:38:55,833
[SPEAKER_11]: Some accounts are constantly being used.

1201
01:38:55,853 --> 01:39:00,377
[SPEAKER_11]: Others are, we put some money here, and then they'll come to me at the end of the year and say,

1202
01:39:01,185 --> 01:39:04,008
[SPEAKER_11]: raise this little bit of money and we're going to have a little party for the students.

1203
01:39:04,048 --> 01:39:07,171
[SPEAKER_11]: It's related to only student-based ideas.

1204
01:39:07,311 --> 01:39:10,373
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not anything to pay for anyone.

1205
01:39:10,854 --> 01:39:17,380
[SPEAKER_11]: It either reimburses someone for supplies or it provides an event for students.

1206
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:24,006
[SPEAKER_11]: The outside schools have much smaller activity because their PTOs have actually taken over.

1207
01:39:25,151 --> 01:39:33,114
[SPEAKER_11]: We've actually used to keep PTO money in student activity, and since that re-audit, we've moved all the PTO money out.

1208
01:39:33,414 --> 01:39:37,295
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was just my other question was, is there a Curtis-Tufts PTO?

1209
01:39:37,675 --> 01:39:40,376
[SPEAKER_04]: There is not that I was able to find at this time.

1210
01:39:40,536 --> 01:39:43,277
[SPEAKER_11]: And Curtis-Tufts is part of Bedford High School student activities.

1211
01:39:43,477 --> 01:39:48,619
[SPEAKER_11]: So because it's a small entity, we moved everything at the Curtis-Tufts.

1212
01:39:48,899 --> 01:39:51,300
[SPEAKER_11]: They do have money, they do receive donations.

1213
01:39:52,411 --> 01:39:53,672
[SPEAKER_11]: from former students.

1214
01:39:54,332 --> 01:39:59,836
[SPEAKER_11]: They also have a box of hooks or something and they might get $50 in, something like that.

1215
01:40:00,596 --> 01:40:04,819
[SPEAKER_11]: And that money will go in their student activities and they'll be able to use it for things that they do.

1216
01:40:05,359 --> 01:40:07,600
[SPEAKER_11]: They do a cooking program that's terrific.

1217
01:40:08,181 --> 01:40:14,344
[SPEAKER_11]: I reimburse for a lot of Stop and Shop gift cards for the teacher to go and buy food with the students at Stop and Shop.

1218
01:40:14,424 --> 01:40:16,025
[SPEAKER_11]: That's one of the things that they do.

1219
01:40:16,586 --> 01:40:17,006
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1220
01:40:17,866 --> 01:40:18,947
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very, very much.

1221
01:40:19,668 --> 01:40:20,328
[SPEAKER_09]: One last question?

1222
01:40:21,844 --> 01:40:22,444
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1223
01:40:22,505 --> 01:40:23,906
[SPEAKER_09]: The Method Foundation?

1224
01:40:24,146 --> 01:40:27,648
[SPEAKER_15]: The Educational Foundation.

1225
01:40:28,369 --> 01:40:29,230
[SPEAKER_09]: It's on there.

1226
01:40:29,250 --> 01:40:29,370
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

1227
01:40:29,530 --> 01:40:29,790
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1228
01:40:30,230 --> 01:40:31,191
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that on the list?

1229
01:40:31,211 --> 01:40:31,992
[SPEAKER_09]: It's on the list.

1230
01:40:32,212 --> 01:40:32,952
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, great.

1231
01:40:33,093 --> 01:40:33,833
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah, I didn't see it.

1232
01:40:34,293 --> 01:40:45,682
[SPEAKER_09]: And my other point is when we get the friends of the activities accounts, we also need contact information for people in charge of those accounts as well.

1233
01:40:46,082 --> 01:40:49,365
[SPEAKER_09]: We want the same information that we're getting for

1234
01:40:50,032 --> 01:40:52,473
[SPEAKER_09]: the PTOs and the non-profits.

1235
01:40:52,893 --> 01:40:57,454
[SPEAKER_09]: So they should fill out the paperwork in the same manner, whoever's the head of that.

1236
01:40:57,474 --> 01:40:59,895
[SPEAKER_11]: So you're talking about the student, you're looking at the advisor?

1237
01:41:00,315 --> 01:41:12,218
[SPEAKER_09]: No, yeah, the friends of Method Soccer, the friends of Method Baseball, the friends of those, if they come up listed under activities, we need to know who's on those bank accounts.

1238
01:41:12,498 --> 01:41:14,538
[SPEAKER_11]: Hold on a minute, this is our bank.

1239
01:41:14,558 --> 01:41:16,439
[SPEAKER_11]: No, this is our accounts, they're our bank accounts.

1240
01:41:17,535 --> 01:41:23,979
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, well, what about the groups that have those others that have their own bank accounts that aren't through the schools?

1241
01:41:24,399 --> 01:41:25,459
[SPEAKER_20]: That's all the 501C3s.

1242
01:41:25,739 --> 01:41:30,022
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but if they're not listed as a 501C3... We wouldn't accept that.

1243
01:41:30,042 --> 01:41:31,663
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't know unless someone tells them.

1244
01:41:32,663 --> 01:41:40,287
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I... Earlier, if you know of an entity that needs to be further pursued, furnish it to an assembly.

1245
01:41:41,488 --> 01:41:43,529
[SPEAKER_09]: And... Okay.

1246
01:41:44,049 --> 01:41:46,791
[SPEAKER_09]: Enforcement of groups that...

1247
01:41:47,697 --> 01:42:02,227
[SPEAKER_09]: or helping them get on to 501c3 is our next goal then, to make sure that all those groups are self-reporting, because it's mandated by the school district, by the school committee.

1248
01:42:03,688 --> 01:42:13,515
[SPEAKER_06]: So there is a difference in terms of their student activity raising, and they would not be able to get their own 501c3, because they are operating under our tax ID.

1249
01:42:13,875 --> 01:42:15,136
[SPEAKER_06]: So they would, those groups,

1250
01:42:16,591 --> 01:42:19,073
[SPEAKER_06]: 60-plus groups that we're going to provide.

1251
01:42:19,093 --> 01:42:20,894
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think she's talking... You're not talking about them?

1252
01:42:20,934 --> 01:42:21,535
[SPEAKER_10]: They wouldn't be.

1253
01:42:21,555 --> 01:42:21,595
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1254
01:42:21,615 --> 01:42:22,415
[SPEAKER_06]: This is an addition.

1255
01:42:22,435 --> 01:42:24,817
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the ones that are following... They're neither.

1256
01:42:24,837 --> 01:42:25,297
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1257
01:42:25,317 --> 01:42:29,901
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not student activities, not a 501c3, but they're out there collecting and doing things.

1258
01:42:29,941 --> 01:42:30,121
[SPEAKER_10]: That's...

1259
01:42:31,366 --> 01:42:33,588
[SPEAKER_20]: I just wouldn't be able to contact them, because I don't know who they are.

1260
01:42:33,668 --> 01:42:37,111
[SPEAKER_20]: But if you know who they are, I'm happy to reach out.

1261
01:42:37,832 --> 01:42:39,213
[SPEAKER_11]: Just one little small thing.

1262
01:42:39,814 --> 01:42:44,558
[SPEAKER_11]: When the PTOs had to move out of student activities, it was difficult for them to figure that piece out.

1263
01:42:45,138 --> 01:42:50,043
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just did a bunch of Google things, sent them the little videos you can see that helped them.

1264
01:42:50,483 --> 01:42:55,448
[SPEAKER_11]: It took them a little bit of time, because as she said, they're all volunteers, these mothers and fathers.

1265
01:42:56,488 --> 01:43:02,992
[SPEAKER_11]: But all the PTOs that had not set up 50C335, they were able to do it.

1266
01:43:03,093 --> 01:43:08,536
[SPEAKER_11]: It took them time, because the banks kept saying, well, we need a tax ID number, and then having them help them find that.

1267
01:43:09,216 --> 01:43:15,540
[SPEAKER_11]: So we did work, I did work with them, and Pat Belly was part of that too, trying to get them to set themselves up.

1268
01:43:16,341 --> 01:43:18,202
[SPEAKER_11]: So it did take time, you're right, it's not easy.

1269
01:43:18,622 --> 01:43:19,823
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, and it costs money.

1270
01:43:21,141 --> 01:43:21,541
[SPEAKER_10]: Very good.

1271
01:43:21,581 --> 01:43:24,323
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a motion on the floor to accept this report, place it on file?

1272
01:43:24,543 --> 01:43:27,385
[SPEAKER_09]: With the amendment that we get a follow-up report.

1273
01:43:27,605 --> 01:43:31,267
[SPEAKER_10]: That we get a follow-up of all of the student activity accounts.

1274
01:43:33,308 --> 01:43:34,189
[SPEAKER_10]: Second by Ms.

1275
01:43:34,749 --> 01:43:35,049
[SPEAKER_10]: Kretz.

1276
01:43:35,850 --> 01:43:36,550
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

1277
01:43:37,271 --> 01:43:37,911
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

1278
01:43:37,951 --> 01:43:38,652
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

1279
01:43:38,672 --> 01:43:41,794
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, new business.

1280
01:43:42,254 --> 01:43:43,435
[SPEAKER_10]: School committee resolutions.

1281
01:43:43,655 --> 01:43:48,918
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of William Bill Brady.

1282
01:43:49,545 --> 01:43:52,846
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Brady was a member of the Medford School Committee for 25 years.

1283
01:43:53,426 --> 01:43:57,528
[SPEAKER_10]: He was a tireless advocate for all aspects of education, and he will be missed in Medford.

1284
01:43:57,988 --> 01:44:01,609
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Brady was the uncle of Medford math coach Ellie O'Leary.

1285
01:44:02,530 --> 01:44:07,331
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Elaine Torres.

1286
01:44:07,531 --> 01:44:07,711
[SPEAKER_10]: Ms.

1287
01:44:07,771 --> 01:44:12,613
[SPEAKER_10]: Torres was the wife of the late Angel Torres, who was a teacher and coach at Medford High School.

1288
01:44:14,174 --> 01:44:18,255
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Patrick Carr.

1289
01:44:18,806 --> 01:44:26,891
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Carr was a Medford police detective for many years, and he was the husband of the late Shirley Carr, an administrative assistant at the Medford Vocational Technical High School.

1290
01:44:27,772 --> 01:44:32,475
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Guadalupe Maturana.

1291
01:44:32,615 --> 01:44:42,601
[SPEAKER_10]: Mrs. Maturana was the wife of the late Guy Maturana, who established the Spartans Youth Football League, which eventually became the Pop Warner Football, as well served as president of the North Medford Little League.

1292
01:44:43,683 --> 01:44:46,464
[SPEAKER_10]: both of which he guided voluntarily for years.

1293
01:44:46,604 --> 01:44:53,005
[SPEAKER_10]: Two of her sons, Craig and James, are in the Mustang Hall of Fame, and her son Alan is a member of the Medford Rotary Club.

1294
01:44:53,145 --> 01:44:55,526
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, Adam is a member of our licensing commission.

1295
01:44:56,426 --> 01:45:03,768
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of James Hayden Downs, father of Andrew's middle school principal, Michael Downs.

1296
01:45:04,348 --> 01:45:08,409
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Downs was a retired Vietnam veteran residing in Nashville, Tennessee.

1297
01:45:09,309 --> 01:45:11,110
[SPEAKER_10]: If we could all please rise for a moment of silence.

1298
01:45:23,755 --> 01:45:25,076
[SPEAKER_10]: School Committee Resolution.

1299
01:45:27,618 --> 01:45:36,226
[SPEAKER_10]: Whereas, free public schools available to all students without exception are foundational to our democracy and are required by the state constitution.

1300
01:45:36,967 --> 01:45:48,837
[SPEAKER_10]: And whereas, all of our students, no matter where they live, deserve high-quality public schools that teach the whole child and provide them with a rich school experience that addresses their academic, social, and emotional needs.

1301
01:45:49,590 --> 01:46:02,053
[SPEAKER_10]: Whereas, the state's foundation budget formula, which determines state aid to each district, has been woefully out of date for years, thereby underfunding our districts by more than $1 billion a year for essential educational services.

1302
01:46:02,993 --> 01:46:06,734
[SPEAKER_10]: And whereas, an updated foundation budget formula would bring Medford up to $4,134,000

1303
01:46:10,376 --> 01:46:20,059
[SPEAKER_10]: $775 in additional state aid each year, allowing us to move closer to providing all students with the education to which they are entitled as residents of the Commonwealth.

1304
01:46:20,799 --> 01:46:33,962
[SPEAKER_10]: And whereas the legislature failed to pass any foundation budget legislation in the last session, leaving districts, educators, and students without the funds necessary to support the schools our students deserve in every district in the state.

1305
01:46:34,602 --> 01:46:38,303
[SPEAKER_10]: Therefore, be it resolved that the Medford School Committee urges the legislature

1306
01:46:38,753 --> 01:46:47,762
[SPEAKER_10]: to approve and fully fund a new foundation budget formula and support the Education Promise Act as submitted by Senator Sonia Chang-Diaz on May 1, 2019.

1307
01:46:48,202 --> 01:46:51,365
[SPEAKER_10]: And if I could add, the Senate docket number is 101.

1308
01:46:52,006 --> 01:46:58,612
[SPEAKER_10]: It had not received a number, a bill number, but that is certainly a way to track it until it receives such.

1309
01:46:59,653 --> 01:47:22,070
[SPEAKER_10]: I also want to just make note a couple of weeks ago I announced here that we were going to be fighting the fight and even at the Martin Luther King breakfast for the NAACP we stressed that really it's something we all have to be advocating for because certainly the districts across the commonwealth are being underfunded in general and then when you look at Medford in particular it hurts.

1310
01:47:22,170 --> 01:47:26,253
[SPEAKER_10]: When I look at the cherry sheets I've got the governor's new cherry sheets for the upcoming year.

1311
01:47:27,090 --> 01:47:39,204
[SPEAKER_10]: And while a little bit of Chapter 70, which is our unrestricted numbers, are going up by measly dollars, we're getting hit with another million dollars net for charter school spending for 424 students.

1312
01:47:39,504 --> 01:47:46,271
[SPEAKER_10]: It's an average of about 16 grand a kid that's going out the door for the charter school students, and the average coming in the door with our 70

1313
01:47:47,094 --> 01:47:52,537
[SPEAKER_10]: for our over 4,000 students are about a little over $1,000 that we're getting from the Commonwealth.

1314
01:47:52,918 --> 01:47:54,138
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's a huge disparity.

1315
01:47:54,178 --> 01:47:55,019
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a huge issue.

1316
01:47:55,879 --> 01:47:59,261
[SPEAKER_10]: Senator Chang-Diaz's bill actually lifts everyone up.

1317
01:47:59,321 --> 01:48:06,526
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not really creating animosity between the true publics and the true charters, but it's trying to raise everyone up.

1318
01:48:06,746 --> 01:48:08,247
[SPEAKER_10]: And just as late as Friday,

1319
01:48:08,950 --> 01:48:15,313
[SPEAKER_10]: A House representative offered a bill as well, similar to Senator Chang-Diaz's, with some nuances in it.

1320
01:48:15,433 --> 01:48:18,834
[SPEAKER_10]: So there are three bills right now that are tracking in the legislature.

1321
01:48:19,474 --> 01:48:21,675
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're going to keep abreast of them all.

1322
01:48:22,075 --> 01:48:26,737
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll notify you as things change to let you know the impacts from each of them.

1323
01:48:27,297 --> 01:48:32,680
[SPEAKER_10]: Senator Diaz's did not have a time number of years for implementation.

1324
01:48:33,360 --> 01:48:38,422
[SPEAKER_10]: The governor had a five-year time that he was going to implement in small doses.

1325
01:48:39,186 --> 01:48:42,668
[SPEAKER_10]: And likewise, the House version has a five-year commitment to it.

1326
01:48:42,828 --> 01:48:50,571
[SPEAKER_10]: So there are a lot of differences between the three bills, and we're hoping that our Metro Mayors Coalition can put together some really good comparisons.

1327
01:48:50,911 --> 01:48:59,915
[SPEAKER_10]: I've tried to sit down and determine what the differences mean, but it's very technical because they're amendments to the current bill, the current law.

1328
01:49:00,496 --> 01:49:03,779
[SPEAKER_10]: So you have to read the current law alongside all the amendments to figure them all out.

1329
01:49:03,999 --> 01:49:05,060
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's very complicated.

1330
01:49:05,320 --> 01:49:09,864
[SPEAKER_10]: Foundation budget, Christine got blessed, is extremely complicated to understand.

1331
01:49:09,884 --> 01:49:13,928
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Russo, did you want to comment?

1332
01:49:24,202 --> 01:49:31,567
[SPEAKER_02]: And I say, no, that's $4 million every single year we're not getting that we should have gotten.

1333
01:49:31,647 --> 01:49:32,467
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a lot of money.

1334
01:49:32,487 --> 01:49:45,095
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we look at heating at the high school or whatever other facility issue that we have, $4 million every single year that we should have been getting adds up, just in a decade, to $1.5 million.

1335
01:49:46,153 --> 01:49:49,756
[SPEAKER_02]: our entire MSPA loan that we wanted.

1336
01:49:50,457 --> 01:49:56,141
[SPEAKER_02]: So this $4 million will quickly make a difference if we can start getting it.

1337
01:49:56,281 --> 01:50:08,411
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reality is the state owes us and every other city since 2001 when they stopped increasing and started decreasing.

1338
01:50:08,571 --> 01:50:12,755
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're owed a lot in arrears, but if we could just get

1339
01:50:13,785 --> 01:50:14,345
[SPEAKER_02]: Go forward.

1340
01:50:14,385 --> 01:50:15,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Go forward would be a nice start.

1341
01:50:15,966 --> 01:50:21,927
[SPEAKER_10]: Versus seeing a negative $1 million monetary sheet, which is like, it's shocking.

1342
01:50:22,187 --> 01:50:22,427
[SPEAKER_10]: Shocking.

1343
01:50:22,448 --> 01:50:25,949
[SPEAKER_10]: It's shocking to continue to see that downward spiral every year.

1344
01:50:25,969 --> 01:50:26,689
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1345
01:50:26,829 --> 01:50:30,750
[SPEAKER_10]: So if we could send this to the governor, our state delegation.

1346
01:50:32,025 --> 01:50:35,088
[SPEAKER_10]: and continue every couple of weeks.

1347
01:50:35,128 --> 01:50:39,892
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we have to re-look at this and then send out blasts and get parents and all of our teachers.

1348
01:50:39,912 --> 01:50:43,416
[SPEAKER_10]: This impacts teachers, parents, administrators across the board.

1349
01:50:43,476 --> 01:50:46,759
[SPEAKER_10]: So we need everybody to be in on this fight collaboratively.

1350
01:50:46,779 --> 01:50:57,088
[SPEAKER_02]: I also would like to add, it impacts all of the Medford taxpayers because you have to decide when we're doing our budget

1351
01:50:58,268 --> 01:51:01,910
[SPEAKER_02]: How much does the school get, which is our biggest spending?

1352
01:51:02,250 --> 01:51:03,751
[SPEAKER_02]: And how much does the rest of the city get?

1353
01:51:04,711 --> 01:51:13,396
[SPEAKER_02]: And it ends up being that you have to give the schools more than perhaps is fair to the rest of the citizens.

1354
01:51:14,536 --> 01:51:18,418
[SPEAKER_02]: So our streets suffer because of that $4 million every year.

1355
01:51:20,319 --> 01:51:22,420
[SPEAKER_02]: It really is everybody that's impacted.

1356
01:51:24,987 --> 01:51:25,748
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Benedetto.

1357
01:51:26,368 --> 01:51:44,742
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this is an opportunity for the school committee to work collaboratively with the city council and ask them to join us with our efforts and ask them to provide a similar letter to our governor and our legislative people.

1358
01:51:44,842 --> 01:51:54,790
[SPEAKER_09]: So could we send a letter to our city council members and if you want any of us to go and speak

1359
01:51:55,467 --> 01:51:58,530
[SPEAKER_09]: on behalf of them joining, I'm more than willing to do that.

1360
01:51:59,570 --> 01:52:00,211
[SPEAKER_10]: Very good.

1361
01:52:00,231 --> 01:52:06,356
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a motion on the floor, Mr. Russo, to accept this resolution, seconded by Ms.

1362
01:52:06,376 --> 01:52:09,179
[SPEAKER_10]: Van de Kloet, maybe collectively, seconded by all?

1363
01:52:09,899 --> 01:52:12,261
[SPEAKER_10]: Roll call vote, please.

1364
01:52:14,263 --> 01:52:15,224
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1365
01:52:16,304 --> 01:52:16,505
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1366
01:52:19,247 --> 01:52:19,627
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1367
01:52:19,747 --> 01:52:22,229
[SPEAKER_10]: On a vote of six in the affirmative, one absent, motion passes.

1368
01:52:23,210 --> 01:52:23,931
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to adjourn?

1369
01:52:25,774 --> 01:52:26,677
[SPEAKER_10]: See you Saturday?

1370
01:52:26,698 --> 01:52:28,745
[SPEAKER_10]: Come get an ice cream.

1371
01:52:28,925 --> 01:52:30,812
[SPEAKER_10]: Come meet your school committee representatives.
