I believe he's on.

80
00:03:24,677 --> 00:03:25,478
Yes, we have him out.

81
00:03:25,498 --> 00:03:27,239

Good evening.

My name is Mohammed Masood.

Thank you, Mr. President.

00:03:45,533 --> 00:03:47,934
Again, I see all the paperwork in order.

91
00:03:49,335 --> 00:03:52,638
Just the hours of operations, they're not changing.

92
00:03:53,987 --> 00:03:55,208
Nothing changed, everything is the same.

93
00:03:55,228 --> 00:04:01,831
Okay, but with the new Council Night, it's 11 to 11, so everything's in order.

94
00:04:02,472 --> 00:04:09,535
Again, I find all the paperwork present and in favor of the petitioner, so I move approval.

95
00:04:10,095 --> 00:04:12,777
Motion by Councilor Scarpelli to approve, seconded by?

96
00:04:12,797 --> 00:04:13,157
Second.

97
00:04:13,517 --> 00:04:14,898
Seconded by Councilor Caraballo.

98
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:19,760
Do any councilors have any questions for the petitioner or for the chair of licensing?

99
00:04:20,601 --> 00:04:21,281
Councilor Caraballo.

100
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:28,370
As I drive by these times, I would hope that you'll do a better job of the rubbish.

101
00:04:29,468 --> 00:04:32,989
than the previous owner did, so that's my only request of you.

102
00:04:33,009 --> 00:04:34,349
Your mic just went out, could you repeat that?

103
00:04:34,369 --> 00:04:34,990
Oh, I'm sorry.

104
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,910
Yeah, it's on now.

105
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:56,195
Mr. Mahoon, as I drive by there many times during the week, I would just hope that you do a better job with the rubbish than the other, than your previous owner did, because they say the trash is out there all the time and not very attractive for the neighbor, so that's all I ask you is,

106
00:04:57,095 --> 00:04:59,157
is to get that trash situation under control there.

107
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:01,118
Mr. Masood.

108
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:08,904
Actually, we try to do our best, what he said.

109
00:05:11,126 --> 00:05:11,827
I'll do my best.

110
00:05:14,008 --> 00:05:14,409
Thank you.

111
00:05:14,729 --> 00:05:15,029
Thank you.

112
00:05:15,489 --> 00:05:15,830
Thank you.

113
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,472
Any further questions from the Council?

114
00:05:23,102 --> 00:05:27,243
Seeing none, on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Caravaglio to approve.

115
00:05:27,303 --> 00:05:28,603
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

116
00:05:28,803 --> 00:05:29,503
Councilor Caravaglio.

117
00:05:29,923 --> 00:05:30,164
Yes.

118
00:05:30,884 --> 00:05:31,564
Councilor Collins.

119
00:05:31,844 --> 00:05:32,044
Yes.

120
00:05:32,564 --> 00:05:33,104
Councilor Knight.

121
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:33,644
Yes.

122
00:05:34,164 --> 00:05:34,925
Councilor Scarpelli.

123
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:35,325
Yes.

124
00:05:35,765 --> 00:05:36,325
Councilor Sang.

125
00:05:36,565 --> 00:05:36,705
Yes.

126
00:05:37,365 --> 00:05:37,965
President Morrell.

127
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:38,665
Yes.

Yes.

130
00:05:41,726 --> 00:05:43,386
Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

131
00:05:43,406 --> 00:05:44,307
The motion passes.

132
00:05:44,347 --> 00:05:45,667
Congratulations, Mr. Matsui.

133
00:05:46,107 --> 00:05:46,407
Good luck.

134
00:05:46,507 --> 00:05:46,847
Thank you.

135
00:05:47,407 --> 00:05:47,727
Thank you.

136
00:05:49,888 --> 00:05:50,788
Mr. President, can we,

137
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:53,379
No.

138
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:55,240
22-022 communication from the mayor.

139
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,662
Yes, thank you, Councillor Scarpelli.

140
00:05:57,682 --> 00:06:03,746
22-022 communication from the mayor to the Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council, City Hall.

141
00:06:05,857 --> 00:06:09,118
Medford, Massachusetts, 02155, regarding budget amendment.

142
00:06:09,258 --> 00:06:15,381
Dear Mr. President and councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that the city council approves the following amendment to the fiscal year 2022 budget.

143
00:06:15,401 --> 00:06:17,802
Line item 0101515032, contract legal services, FY22 budgeted amount, $26,600.

144
00:06:26,445 --> 00:06:42,446
proposed amended about $81,600 following the passage of the fiscal year 2022 budget by the council I engaged in conversations with Council President Carabino, City Solicitor Kim Scanlon, and KP Law to develop a process where the council can avail themselves of KP Law's services and counsel as needed.

145
00:06:43,207 --> 00:06:55,436
In those discussions, it was agreed that requests for council attendance or advice will be submitted by the council through the council president, who will coordinate with the city solicitor, who will schedule meetings with KP Law to get whatever legal resources are needed to address the council's requests.

146
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,418
Respectfully submitted, Brianna Lumgo-Kern, Mayor.

147
00:06:58,878 --> 00:07:00,459
This was on the agenda last week.

148
00:07:00,619 --> 00:07:03,561
It was postponed for one week on rule 20.

149
00:07:04,942 --> 00:07:06,824
I saw Councilor Kerrio and then Councilor Scarbelli.

150
00:07:06,944 --> 00:07:27,241
And Mr. President, I'll just reaffirm for people who didn't see this last week, in my discussions with the Mayor last year, for KP Law to represent the Council, it was the Council's request that we have a direct contact and not a go-between, and I think that was the holdup between on the $26,000, and it hasn't changed since then.

151
00:07:31,758 --> 00:07:32,579
Councilor Scarpelli.

152
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:35,061
So if we could, I have the same question.

153
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:54,998
I think that if we can table this and call for a Committee of the Whole meeting before our meeting next week, a regular meeting, and ask the city solicitor and maybe the chief of staff, just to clarify, I think that this is important for the fact that what we asked for is a representation.

154
00:07:55,358 --> 00:07:58,381
So we, at the time when this all occurred, didn't look like

155
00:08:00,492 --> 00:08:19,125
uneducated buffoons and dog chasing his tail when we had legal issues, not to battle against our own administration, but just to guide us on legal terms and legal movements as we had some concerns.

156
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:28,511
So, I don't wanna see this, if this could be rectified in a committee of the whole meeting where,

157
00:08:30,455 --> 00:08:34,957
we can iron this out and make sure this is defined a little bit better.

158
00:08:35,017 --> 00:08:39,379
So it does appease both parties and we could have someone that represents the council.

159
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:43,681
I think that would be amazing.

160
00:08:43,701 --> 00:08:47,663
I just don't want it to fail this evening and then sit again for a few months.

161
00:08:47,703 --> 00:08:56,547
So my motion would be to table for committee of the whole meeting next week with the chief of staff in the city solicitor.

162
00:08:59,025 --> 00:09:02,888
excuse me, we do have a committee of the whole already scheduled for next Tuesday at 5.30.

163
00:09:04,249 --> 00:09:05,369
Kim Scanlon will be there.

164
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,171
It is regarding the elections commission.

165
00:09:09,212 --> 00:09:12,354
So we will have her, we could discuss the process.

166
00:09:13,295 --> 00:09:14,976
She is scheduled to be before us on the day.

167
00:09:15,036 --> 00:09:19,740
Okay, well, I think it wouldn't be, I think it would just be a defining evening for this.

168
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,483
I don't think this would take too long, but if we can add that.

169
00:09:24,943 --> 00:09:25,243
Gotcha.

170
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:32,081
There's a motion by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Ntuk-Table.

171
00:09:32,461 --> 00:09:33,242
Councilor Collins.

172
00:09:34,342 --> 00:09:34,763
Thank you.

173
00:09:36,123 --> 00:09:50,472
Before we vote, I'd just like to voice, you know, one thing that I heard from Chief of Staff Nazari in our discussion on this proposal last week was a concern that failure to quickly pass this budget amendment would

174
00:09:51,272 --> 00:09:56,276
leave the administration short on legal counsel in the short term or maybe for the rest of the fiscal year.

175
00:09:56,897 --> 00:10:11,329
So that is a concern of mine because I could see a lot of circumstances where having, you know, any department in the city having insufficient access to legal counsel on a variety of matters could really hold us up and, you know, any numerous important issues that we're trying to work on.

176
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:14,111
over the next five, six months.

177
00:10:14,171 --> 00:10:17,152
So that is a concern of mine.

178
00:10:17,172 --> 00:10:21,733
And that's why I'm leaning towards trying to pass this expediently, because I totally agree.

179
00:10:21,753 --> 00:10:26,455
I'd like to see us lobby for independent counsel for this council going forward.

180
00:10:26,495 --> 00:10:35,058
But I do have pretty strong reservations about, you know, delaying passage of the amendment and ripple effects that that could have for the administration in the short term.

181
00:10:35,998 --> 00:10:37,399
If I can point information with that.

182
00:10:38,517 --> 00:10:42,581
Actually, the clerk has reminded me that a motion to table is not debatable.

183
00:10:42,821 --> 00:10:44,903
I'm still getting up on my council rules.

184
00:10:44,983 --> 00:10:48,166
So we will have to vote on that before we have further debate.

185
00:10:48,806 --> 00:10:51,609
So, Mr. Clerk, on the motion to table, if you could please call the roll.

186
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:53,991
Councilor Kerrio?

187
00:10:54,171 --> 00:10:54,411
Yes.

188
00:10:55,132 --> 00:10:55,732
Councilor Collins?

189
00:10:56,253 --> 00:10:56,393
No.

190
00:10:56,433 --> 00:10:58,115
Councilor Nye?

191
00:10:58,155 --> 00:10:58,435
Yes.

192
00:10:58,455 --> 00:10:59,696
Councilor Stroud?

193
00:10:59,836 --> 00:11:00,156
Yes.

194
00:11:00,877 --> 00:11:01,377
Councilor Sanders?

195
00:11:01,678 --> 00:11:02,058
No.

196
00:11:02,999 --> 00:11:03,619
President Morrell?

197
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:04,280
No.

198
00:11:07,204 --> 00:11:07,905
Vice President Ferris.

199
00:11:08,065 --> 00:11:10,426
No, three in the affirmative, four in the negative.

200
00:11:10,747 --> 00:11:11,928
The motion is not tabled.

201
00:11:12,768 --> 00:11:15,130
Councilor Snider.

202
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:32,223
No, it's disheartening for my fellow councilor, who's new to the process, who just shared some insight, those fears that we're leaving the city without legal representation for one week, when we wanna make sure, until you're sitting in this council,

203
00:11:32,743 --> 00:11:58,509
and I'm shocked with my veteran counselors that sat here and watched our dogs chase the tail and how embarrassing it was for us to sit here for two meetings because we didn't have representation and how hard we fought during the budget meeting to get a line item that represented what we asked for and then to come back and something disingenuine to say that we're asking for, we're getting money, but it can't be used for what we're asking for.

204
00:11:58,729 --> 00:12:00,790
It's just giving the city more money

205
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:08,713
the negative ramifications we've seen with the assistance from KP law and different city functions.

206
00:12:08,733 --> 00:12:10,374
So it's a little deciding to me.

207
00:12:10,914 --> 00:12:13,976
I understand everybody has a vote and we've spoken.

208
00:12:14,036 --> 00:12:25,282
So I will not vote for it because I think we needed a week to get better understanding with the chief of staff and the legal representation from the city to guide us when we have questions.

209
00:12:25,982 --> 00:12:28,263
Okay, so if that, it is what it is.

210
00:12:28,283 --> 00:12:28,823
So thank you.

211
00:12:30,184 --> 00:12:31,085
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

212
00:12:32,898 --> 00:12:33,639
Any counselors?

213
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:34,661
Mr. President?

214
00:12:34,681 --> 00:12:36,784
Yes, President Morrell.

215
00:12:37,485 --> 00:12:38,486
I do see Chief of Staff, Ms.

216
00:12:38,547 --> 00:12:40,269
Aaron, she is on the call right now.

217
00:12:40,309 --> 00:12:42,392
I don't know if counselors have questions at the moment.

218
00:12:43,173 --> 00:12:45,136
I just want to point that out.

219
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:47,139
Thank you.

220
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,021
Counselor Knight.

221
00:12:48,507 --> 00:12:49,788
Mr. President, thank you very much.

222
00:12:49,988 --> 00:12:52,229
Again, I will reiterate my statement from last week.

223
00:12:53,010 --> 00:13:11,140
This matter presented itself when the Medford City Council at a meeting where it established its priorities for the term said that a priority for this council was to retain independent legal counsel for the Medford City Council, to get a lawyer for the council, an assistant city solicitor to represent the council.

224
00:13:12,021 --> 00:13:14,102
Now, I believe by statute,

225
00:13:15,204 --> 00:13:19,765
the city solicitor is required to represent both the council and the administration impartially.

226
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:34,570
When KP Law was before us and Jonathan Silverstein was before us, he posed the question and the question was, if in fact you're retained by the city of Medford, who do you work for?

227
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:38,391
Do you work for the Medford city council, the city of Medford or the city administration?

228
00:13:38,991 --> 00:13:40,952
And his answer was, I work for the administration.

229
00:13:41,934 --> 00:13:45,136
So here we are, the council asking for independent legal counsel.

230
00:13:46,157 --> 00:13:49,899
We have a letter from the mayor, a communication from the mayor that says, it was agreed.

231
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:56,863
It was agreed that request for council attendance or advice will be submitted through the president.

232
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:57,624
It wasn't agreed.

233
00:13:57,684 --> 00:14:00,566
The council president at the time is sitting right here and he's saying it wasn't agreed.

234
00:14:01,653 --> 00:14:06,877
On face value, this paper is untruthful, because it was not agreed.

235
00:14:07,538 --> 00:14:08,218
It was not agreed.

236
00:14:08,738 --> 00:14:13,762
Now, here we are, and this issue first came up, and it first came up in July, June, June.

237
00:14:13,942 --> 00:14:15,584
It first came up in June of 2021.

238
00:14:17,105 --> 00:14:21,068
And I find it curious that this paper never found its way to the council agenda, Mr. President.

239
00:14:21,648 --> 00:14:26,272
Never found its way to the council agenda until Councilor Marks and Councilor Falco were gone.

240
00:14:29,046 --> 00:14:37,310
The administration had plenty of time to bring this paper to the table and to negotiate with the then-council president terms that would be satisfactory to the council that set those priorities.

241
00:14:37,991 --> 00:14:46,215
And instead what they did, shockingly, was sat on their hands for three months and waited for the weather to change, and then brought the paper forward.

242
00:14:46,736 --> 00:14:47,596
And I think that's shameful.

243
00:14:48,336 --> 00:14:49,057
I think it's shameful.

244
00:14:50,106 --> 00:15:01,395
So here we are in no further or better of a position than we were back in June when we cut this item out of the budget because the council was not satisfied with the services that we were receiving.

245
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:09,861
But the paper's back on the table and we've not moved one inch closer to a positive resolve.

246
00:15:10,962 --> 00:15:12,223
Councilor Collins makes a point.

247
00:15:12,303 --> 00:15:15,586
She says, there might be a disruption in services.

248
00:15:16,684 --> 00:15:18,564
You're gonna hear that a lot, Councilor Collins.

249
00:15:18,845 --> 00:15:19,785
You're gonna hear that a lot.

250
00:15:19,825 --> 00:15:22,025
You have to pass this tonight, or Rome's gonna burn.

251
00:15:22,605 --> 00:15:24,146
We want it now, we need it now.

252
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:25,846
If not, Medford's gonna fall apart.

253
00:15:27,547 --> 00:15:29,307
It's a sell, that's all it is, is a sell.

254
00:15:29,547 --> 00:15:33,388
Medford's not gonna fall apart if they don't have these contracted legal services in this budget.

255
00:15:34,448 --> 00:15:37,369
This is an increase to the budget, another increase to the budget.

256
00:15:38,009 --> 00:15:39,890
Week two of the new term,

257
00:15:40,802 --> 00:15:45,243
Week two, we've already seen this year's fiscal budget increased twice.

258
00:15:45,603 --> 00:15:49,544
In two weeks, two proposals to increase the fiscal year budget.

259
00:15:49,564 --> 00:15:53,265
$191 million, $191 million isn't enough.

260
00:15:54,045 --> 00:15:56,606
More, spend more with no plan.

261
00:15:57,666 --> 00:16:02,427
Piecemeal, week by week, let's come over here in dribs and drabs and see how much we can get out of the council.

262
00:16:03,408 --> 00:16:03,928
It's not right.

263
00:16:05,088 --> 00:16:06,369
It's not right, it's not proper.

264
00:16:06,929 --> 00:16:08,730
The council voted to set a list of priorities.

265
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:13,213
One of the list of priorities was to be able to retain legal counsel to advise it in matters.

266
00:16:14,353 --> 00:16:17,515
Because we haven't received that advice in the past.

267
00:16:18,495 --> 00:16:22,438
And we've seen what great progress we can make when we have the tools in the toolbox.

268
00:16:22,978 --> 00:16:31,843
We've seen what great progress we can make when we have Mike Wabrowski sitting there running meetings for us that take on the first comprehensive zoning reform that the city's seen in a number of years.

269
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:34,590
That's not from the court of office.

270
00:16:35,151 --> 00:16:36,311
That's from the council chambers.

271
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,311
That's where this is coming from.

272
00:16:37,331 --> 00:16:38,832
That's where this work product coming from.

273
00:16:39,172 --> 00:16:41,273
Give us the tools to succeed and we'll succeed.

274
00:16:41,933 --> 00:16:44,614
This negotiation is not negotiation.

275
00:16:45,114 --> 00:16:47,234
This paper is untruthful on its face.

276
00:16:47,494 --> 00:16:48,695
There was never an agreement made.

277
00:16:49,055 --> 00:16:52,016
There was never an agreement brought back to this council and voted on by this council.

278
00:16:52,456 --> 00:16:53,556
The council set a priority.

279
00:16:53,936 --> 00:16:55,817
They said the priority was gonna be to have legal counsel.

280
00:16:56,077 --> 00:16:58,238
We cut this item out of the budget because we didn't have it.

281
00:16:58,858 --> 00:17:02,001
There was no negotiation, there was no settlement to the issue at hand.

282
00:17:02,341 --> 00:17:05,664
The council is once again, get him pushed aside and get him bamboozled.

283
00:17:06,344 --> 00:17:11,669
For that reason, that reason alone, I will not be supporting this paper and I support Councilor Scott Cowie's motion to table it.

284
00:17:12,169 --> 00:17:15,692
If in fact we're going to have a constructive dialogue, let's put everybody in the room together.

285
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:17,153
Let's talk about it.

286
00:17:17,634 --> 00:17:21,036
All right, the mayor thinks she has the keys to the car now because she has two new councilors over here.

287
00:17:21,846 --> 00:17:29,570
that don't have the institutional knowledge or the level of frustration that some of us share from the lack of responses that we receive from our office when we're trying to move the city forward together.

288
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:34,233
And for those reasons, I will not be supporting this paper this evening.

289
00:17:35,174 --> 00:17:35,894
Thank you, Councillor Knight.

290
00:17:36,615 --> 00:17:37,175
Councillor Kerrio.

291
00:17:49,214 --> 00:17:52,096
for the funds that we allocated to them.

292
00:17:52,496 --> 00:17:54,778
Lawsuits and everything.

293
00:17:57,339 --> 00:18:01,842
I wanna know where the money we spent last year went to.

294
00:18:01,862 --> 00:18:05,384
We're fighting lawsuit after lawsuit on zoning.

295
00:18:05,605 --> 00:18:12,469
We lost, I don't know how much we spent to lose the zoning case on Boston Avenue, which we knew we were gonna lose.

296
00:18:12,809 --> 00:18:15,411
We're fighting a 40B that was supposed to start this week.

297
00:18:15,811 --> 00:18:16,512
It's not happening.

298
00:18:16,812 --> 00:18:18,273
We're gonna fight that, we're gonna lose that too.

299
00:18:18,863 --> 00:18:23,065
I mean, are we just running, is KP Law just running up the bill on us?

300
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:28,588
I mean, what kind of advice are they giving us when we're losing lawsuits?

301
00:18:31,189 --> 00:18:34,751
I, again, this isn't what I agreed to.

302
00:18:34,771 --> 00:18:39,034
What I agreed to was that we would have direct contact, not a go between.

303
00:18:39,714 --> 00:18:41,255
And they could not agree to that.

304
00:18:41,355 --> 00:18:44,036
So I can't support this either.

305
00:18:44,897 --> 00:18:45,977
Mr. Clerk, do you have the amendment?

306
00:18:48,617 --> 00:18:57,761
Councilor Kerrio would like a detailed explanation of all the legal services performed by KP law last year.

307
00:18:58,161 --> 00:19:00,062
It was last year, 2021 calendar year.

308
00:19:00,082 --> 00:19:00,062
2021.

309
00:19:00,102 --> 00:19:00,502
Thank you.

310
00:19:00,802 --> 00:19:08,485
These guys are just giving us bad advice and now we're fighting the case against the city of Everett and they're representing Everett and they're leaving us out in the lurch.

311
00:19:08,545 --> 00:19:11,026
And you wanna give them more money.

312
00:19:11,846 --> 00:19:13,547
God, what is the matter with us?

313
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:16,629
Thank you, Councilor Carviello.

314
00:19:16,909 --> 00:19:19,357
Any further discussion from members of the council?

315
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:20,460
Councilor Sang.

316
00:19:23,723 --> 00:19:25,884
I've shared my reservations about this last week.

317
00:19:27,545 --> 00:19:33,667
I've been thinking about it, and I do agree with my fellow councilors that our city needs a better plan.

318
00:19:33,907 --> 00:19:40,249
Our city needs, our city council needs its own direct legal counsel to go to.

319
00:19:40,649 --> 00:19:45,390
But again, I believe that we've been pushing this back and pushing this back.

320
00:19:46,231 --> 00:19:48,351
There's so much in action in the city.

321
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:53,393
Mr. President, Mr. Councilor Kerrio, if you could start.

322
00:19:53,473 --> 00:19:54,353
Thank you.

323
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:59,536
And in this case, I will vote to move this forward.

324
00:20:00,036 --> 00:20:12,764
But again, I would like to express that I have strong reservations about passing a budget this calendar year that doesn't have a direct legal representative for us, for the city council.

325
00:20:13,984 --> 00:20:14,845
Thank you, Councilor Sang.

326
00:20:16,106 --> 00:20:18,367
Any comments from members of the council?

327
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:21,531
Mr. President, if I could.

328
00:20:22,332 --> 00:20:37,566
Yes, President Morrell to the chair if Chief of Staff is Aaron could just explain a little how these funds support solicitor Scanlon the work she is doing for the council and past papers and opinions that have been requested, or how it would.

329
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:41,918
Point of personal privilege on that, Mr. President?

330
00:20:42,058 --> 00:20:43,419
Point of personal privilege, Councilor Nights.

331
00:20:43,559 --> 00:21:02,542
I'm just wondering if when Chief of Staff Nazarian gives her presentation, she can give me an estimate as to when the requested draft ordinance that I put forward back in 2020 with KP Law would be forthcoming relative to establishing a $15 minimum wage for all city and school department employees while she's giving her presentation to the answer.

332
00:21:03,782 --> 00:21:08,483
Councilor Nazarian, if you could answer Councilor Morales' question and Councilor Nights.

333
00:21:09,925 --> 00:21:11,669
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

334
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,633
Thank you, Madam President, for the question.

335
00:21:13,653 --> 00:21:18,965
I want to make sure I'm answering the question.

336
00:21:20,936 --> 00:21:21,897
this this work.

337
00:21:22,678 --> 00:21:31,525
The city has a tremendous amount of legal service needs this work, and I think I might have said this at the last meeting where this was this matter was discussed.

338
00:21:32,026 --> 00:21:33,067
But you know it.

339
00:21:33,327 --> 00:21:43,235
There's various different topics and disciplines in which the city solicitor is being supported by KP law to ensure that we have the discipline

340
00:21:48,996 --> 00:21:52,637
specific counsel who covers matters relating to contracts.

341
00:21:53,138 --> 00:22:02,661
There is specific counsel for matters relating to, you know, additional counsel for matters that relate to additional work.

342
00:22:02,761 --> 00:22:07,443
There was counsel that was consulted with regard to election-specific questions.

343
00:22:07,903 --> 00:22:15,986
So we speak with multiple different counsels who have various expertise, niche-specific expertise in their own disciplines,

344
00:22:16,554 --> 00:22:28,744
like you would expect to find in industry with regard to attorneys, you wouldn't necessarily be able to go to only a general counsel and get discipline specific expert advice.

345
00:22:29,204 --> 00:22:45,397
And so that's where this relationship, this agreement with KP Law to provide services to the city on both a retainer basis and on a billing per hour basis as far as

346
00:22:46,325 --> 00:22:49,907
I apologize, Vice President.

347
00:22:50,087 --> 00:22:50,968
One second, Nina.

348
00:22:52,449 --> 00:22:54,950
With KP Law.

349
00:22:56,391 --> 00:22:56,851
Where is that?

350
00:22:58,953 --> 00:23:00,093
Could you repeat that?

351
00:23:01,554 --> 00:23:05,917
We originally agreed for KP Law to have a budget of $5,000 a month.

352
00:23:06,917 --> 00:23:09,359
Where is that now?

353
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:11,720
$81,000 is well above the $5,000 we agreed upon.

354
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,301
So I'll be going back.

355
00:23:15,043 --> 00:23:16,684
All they're doing is running up the bill on us.

356
00:23:17,725 --> 00:23:18,826
Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

357
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:20,527
The floor is yours, Chief of Staff Nazarian.

358
00:23:21,488 --> 00:23:21,808
Thank you.

359
00:23:21,848 --> 00:23:25,050
So, I mean, I'm happy to answer any specific questions.

360
00:23:25,131 --> 00:23:29,914
I hope, President Morrell, that that answered at least your question.

361
00:23:29,974 --> 00:23:32,336
If there is further question on that, I'm happy to answer it.

362
00:23:32,376 --> 00:23:39,681
And if Councilor Caraviello, if that was a question that you'd like me to answer, I'm happy to do that too.

363
00:23:40,982 --> 00:23:41,383
Yes, please.

364
00:23:43,963 --> 00:23:46,404
you, Mr Vice President, Councilor Carviello.

365
00:23:46,964 --> 00:23:56,345
The present retainer is actually $6800 per month, um, based on the level of work and based on the agreement.

366
00:23:56,465 --> 00:24:03,107
That is what is presently the going rate for the amount of work that we're putting before K P law.

367
00:24:03,127 --> 00:24:08,388
I can tell you without a doubt in my mind that that retainer is being very well used.

368
00:24:08,928 --> 00:24:10,808
Of course, there are other, um,

369
00:24:11,577 --> 00:24:26,951
that are outside those billing retainer hours with regard to litigation, but I can tell you there is not a single month that we do not maximize that $6,800 from the standpoint of general counsel, from the point of labor counsel and from the standpoint of contracts.

370
00:24:27,712 --> 00:24:33,116
Those are all under the retainer and there are other categories that fall under that as well.

371
00:24:33,257 --> 00:24:38,261
And we're gonna be utilizing their services with all of the categories in which that are part of the retainer.

372
00:24:41,048 --> 00:24:42,028
Thank you, Madam Chief of Staff.

373
00:24:42,068 --> 00:24:43,989
Councilor and I did have a question as well.

374
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:50,211
We had requested that KP Law help draft an ordinance for a $15 city minimum wage in 2020.

375
00:24:50,371 --> 00:24:53,192
It was 21 months ago, maybe 20 months ago we made the request.

376
00:24:53,433 --> 00:24:54,853
In a year, yeah, in 2020.

377
00:24:56,214 --> 00:25:02,636
Do you happen to have any specific information as to if KP Law plans to present a draft ordinance to the council?

378
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,442
Thank you, Mr. Vice President for bringing that question back up.

379
00:25:06,702 --> 00:25:11,125
My apologies, Councillor Knight, for not responding to that.

380
00:25:12,625 --> 00:25:14,066
It fell off my radar for a second.

381
00:25:14,627 --> 00:25:19,069
I don't have the answer to that question, but I definitely would be happy to look into it and follow up with the whole council.

382
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,231
Thank you, Madam Chief of Staff.

383
00:25:23,452 --> 00:25:24,132
If I may, Mr. President?

384
00:25:24,453 --> 00:25:25,173
Yes, Councillor Knight.

385
00:25:25,553 --> 00:25:32,057
I find it very interesting that, you know, KP Law has been given such control of this community.

386
00:25:34,386 --> 00:25:39,368
model that we're adopting really provides the city with lack of control direction and retention.

387
00:25:40,468 --> 00:25:47,491
And it also really puts us in a position where we're becoming overreliant on the outsourcing legal services here in this community.

388
00:25:48,711 --> 00:25:50,992
You know, we'll sit here and we'll talk about all the niche laws

389
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:54,777
with a niche law that we can have expertise on.

390
00:25:54,837 --> 00:26:01,062
I mean, ultimately, we have people from the administration going to sick people's houses and checking up on them as part of a labor dispute, we have union busting going on.

391
00:26:01,502 --> 00:26:04,304
All right, we have labor charges being filed against the city left and right.

392
00:26:04,985 --> 00:26:07,987
Okay, we're in with there's over 20 labor charges filed against the city right now.

393
00:26:08,909 --> 00:26:10,169
over 20 labor charges.

394
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:14,891
So I'm not too sure what type of advice we're getting, but it doesn't sound like good advice to me.

395
00:26:14,931 --> 00:26:22,192
When I hear that the chief of staff is going to sick people's houses on a Friday delivering them lettuce, I don't know what kind of advice we're getting, but it doesn't sound like good advice to me.

396
00:26:29,574 --> 00:26:30,254
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

397
00:26:31,475 --> 00:26:32,375
Any further discussion?

398
00:26:36,927 --> 00:26:58,692
from the chair uh oh sorry councillor collins sorry i was a late breaking hand raised yeah um i just wanted to to also note that i really appreciate the discussion around this and to my fellow councillors i hope that my willingness to approve quickly i would never want for that to come across as indifference to the frustration that's been built up over the years and i've

399
00:26:59,632 --> 00:27:08,219
want to acknowledge and respect the fact that there's been back and forth on this issue for years that I wasn't behind the rail for, and I want to know that that's heard.

400
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:18,086
And I'm glad that Councilor Tsang earlier brought up the need to advocate for a fiscal year 2023 budget in which these concerns are really taken seriously.

401
00:27:18,787 --> 00:27:21,249
So I think I'd like to

402
00:27:21,869 --> 00:27:22,689
motion to approve.

403
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:33,095
But, you know, again, want to reiterate, um, you know, I have a concern that this could ripple out into a interruption in service for the residents of this city that's behind my position tonight.

404
00:27:33,175 --> 00:27:40,639
But, you know, I'm hoping that as a council we can advocate for independent legal counsel for going forward is obviously that's very important.

405
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,620
Thank you, Councilor Collins.

406
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:46,682
It's a motion from Councilor Collins to approve, seconded by

407
00:27:49,903 --> 00:27:51,744
Second, Mr. President, if I could as well.

408
00:27:52,944 --> 00:27:53,985
Sure, President Morrell.

409
00:27:55,105 --> 00:27:55,965
Thank you, Mr. President.

410
00:27:56,006 --> 00:28:00,988
Yeah, I just want to note that like my fellow counselors, this is not, this is less than ideal.

411
00:28:01,088 --> 00:28:10,151
As I said last week, my desired outcome of the, you know, my desired setup of this would be having that assistant city solicitor position that has existed for a long time.

412
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:18,635
This is not my ideal situation, but my vote for this is a vote to support solicitor Scanlon in the office where it's,

413
00:28:19,457 --> 00:28:20,437
Again, not my desire.

414
00:28:20,537 --> 00:28:22,218
It seems like it's rather bare bones.

415
00:28:22,758 --> 00:28:24,298
This is a vote for right now.

416
00:28:24,318 --> 00:28:33,221
I absolutely have the same concerns as my fellow counselors, and I do not see myself voting for something like this again in the next fiscal year.

417
00:28:33,961 --> 00:28:39,983
But this is something that I just see as a need for right now, but not something I want to see continue.

418
00:28:40,303 --> 00:28:40,723
So thank you.

419
00:28:42,445 --> 00:28:52,533
Thank you, President Morrell, if I may, from the chair, and I'm trying to avoid doing this tonight, as I, again, read up on my Robert's rules, but I think we have a disagreement on process.

420
00:28:52,893 --> 00:28:54,855
I do not think we have a disagreement on substance.

421
00:28:55,655 --> 00:29:02,761
I'm hopeful a collaborative and good faith approach can get the result that we all share, the desired result that we all share.

422
00:29:03,781 --> 00:29:04,142
Thank you.

423
00:29:05,203 --> 00:29:08,885
On the motion of Councilor Collins, to approve as amended, seconded by?

424
00:29:11,127 --> 00:29:12,248
Seconded by Councilor Sang.

425
00:29:13,586 --> 00:29:14,647
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

426
00:29:18,369 --> 00:29:19,029
Councilor Kerrio?

427
00:29:19,269 --> 00:29:19,469
No.

428
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:21,310
Councilor Collins?

429
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:21,830
Yes.

430
00:29:22,891 --> 00:29:23,411
Councilor Knight?

431
00:29:23,811 --> 00:29:24,032
No.

432
00:29:24,832 --> 00:29:25,592
Councilor Scarpelli?

433
00:29:25,612 --> 00:29:26,053
No.

434
00:29:27,213 --> 00:29:27,714
Councilor Sang?

435
00:29:27,734 --> 00:29:28,074
Yes.

436
00:29:29,595 --> 00:29:30,175
President Morrell?

437
00:29:30,595 --> 00:29:30,815
Yes.

438
00:29:32,616 --> 00:29:33,377
Vice President Ferris?

439
00:29:33,477 --> 00:29:33,737
Yes.

440
00:29:33,857 --> 00:29:36,218
Four in the affirmative, three in the negative, the motion passes.

441
00:29:40,089 --> 00:29:44,671
Motion to revert to the regular order of business by Councillor Knight, seconded by Councillor Scarpelli.

442
00:29:44,711 --> 00:29:45,831
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

443
00:29:49,252 --> 00:29:49,853
Councillor Kerrio?

444
00:29:50,593 --> 00:29:50,773
Yes.

445
00:29:51,573 --> 00:29:52,154
Councillor Collins?

446
00:29:52,614 --> 00:29:52,814
Yes.

447
00:29:53,214 --> 00:29:53,714
Councillor Knight?

448
00:29:53,934 --> 00:29:54,134
Yes.

449
00:29:54,374 --> 00:29:54,995
Councillor Scarpelli?

450
00:29:55,015 --> 00:29:55,115
Yes.

451
00:29:55,915 --> 00:29:56,435
Councillor Singh?

452
00:29:56,635 --> 00:29:56,775
Yes.

453
00:29:57,395 --> 00:29:58,016
President Morrell?

454
00:30:01,117 --> 00:30:01,277
Yes.

455
00:30:03,283 --> 00:30:04,004
Vice president bears.

456
00:30:04,064 --> 00:30:25,507
Yes, 70 affirmative zero and the negative the motion passes motions orders and resolutions 22 dash 026 offered by counselor night be it so resolved that the city chief financial officer slash auditor and necessary consultants provide the council with a quarterly presentation on the city's financial health, including but not limited to forecasted versus actual revenues and ARPA spending counselor night.

457
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:36,521
Mr. President, thank you very much, as indicated in my lengthy soliloquy on the previous matter relative to my concerns relative to the spending in this community.

458
00:30:37,401 --> 00:30:40,124
I've raised this issue in the past, and I put it on the agenda again.

459
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:49,052
Before Anishal Natalie was moved on to greener pastures, she would appear before us quarterly

460
00:30:49,507 --> 00:30:51,949
and provide us with a presentation on our fiscal health and wellness.

461
00:30:52,110 --> 00:31:07,204
And part of that would include, Mr. President, discussion about our forecast of revenues versus our actual returns, where we are in the budget right now in the process of spending, what our debt service obligations are, so on and so forth.

462
00:31:07,704 --> 00:31:12,289
We now have had this great influx of money coming in from the federal government.

463
00:31:12,349 --> 00:31:13,270
We have ARPA money.

464
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:21,294
We're looking at what about $49 million I believe was the figure to be spent over the next three years we've already spent about a quarter of that with no federal funds manager.

465
00:31:21,835 --> 00:31:30,760
So my concerns really focused on being sure that we act as fiscal stewards, and that we are aware of what direction we're going and how much spending

466
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,523
we're committing to, and what position we're going to be putting ourselves into the future.

467
00:31:34,983 --> 00:31:45,170
And I'd like to see our chief financial officer, as well as the necessary consultants that seem to be providing a great deal of services to this community, to be here as well, to answer the questions that we need to address, Mr. President.

468
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:46,812
But this is something that we did last term.

469
00:31:47,172 --> 00:31:50,134
It was something that proved to be very successful, and I'd ask my council colleagues to support it.

470
00:31:51,715 --> 00:31:52,596
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

471
00:31:53,436 --> 00:31:55,698
On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

472
00:31:55,858 --> 00:31:56,779
Is there any discussion?

473
00:32:01,465 --> 00:32:18,776
If I may, from the chair, just add an amendment that we put this resolution under reports due in addition to approving it tonight, put it under reports due so that we can invite the chief financial officer down to a future meeting to give us that presentation.

474
00:32:20,717 --> 00:32:22,218
Well, the title.

475
00:32:23,618 --> 00:32:26,080
Right now, there's an interim person in that position.

476
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:29,963
I believe the position has been posted for a permanent position.

477
00:32:30,163 --> 00:32:40,531
Ultimately, Mr. President, I don't think that the city council's ability to be updated and be filled in as to what's going on in this community should be subject to the personnel disasters that are going on across the hall.

478
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:41,892
Oh, certainly not.

479
00:32:42,173 --> 00:32:43,834
I would invite whoever's in that position right now.

480
00:32:43,854 --> 00:32:47,937
I don't care who the CFO is or auditor is, but that's the person that should be here.

481
00:32:47,957 --> 00:32:52,741
And if they don't have the answers for us, then that's going to be very indicating as to what direction this community is going in financially.

482
00:32:53,288 --> 00:32:54,649
That is the intent of my amendment.

483
00:32:59,252 --> 00:33:01,254
Let's just keep it on because it's quarterly.

484
00:33:01,494 --> 00:33:03,595
So we can keep it on it.

485
00:33:05,276 --> 00:33:05,496
Yeah.

486
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:10,980
Any further discussion?

487
00:33:15,844 --> 00:33:19,946
On the motion of Councillor Knight, seconded by Councillor Scarpelli, as amended by myself.

488
00:33:20,807 --> 00:33:21,848
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

489
00:33:23,262 --> 00:33:23,902
Councilor Kerrio.

490
00:33:25,443 --> 00:33:26,084
Councilor Collins.

491
00:33:26,324 --> 00:33:26,524
Yes.

492
00:33:27,765 --> 00:33:28,245
Also night.

493
00:33:28,325 --> 00:33:28,605
Yes.

494
00:33:29,126 --> 00:33:29,846
Also Scott Kelly.

495
00:33:29,986 --> 00:33:30,166
Yes.

496
00:33:30,386 --> 00:33:31,307
Councilor saying yes.

497
00:33:32,007 --> 00:33:32,688
President Morrell.

498
00:33:33,028 --> 00:33:33,228
Yes.

499
00:33:34,629 --> 00:33:35,330
Vice President bears.

500
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:48,598
Yes 70 affirmative zero the negative the motion passes 22 027 offered by Councilor night, be it so resolved that the city chief financial officer auditor provide the city council with a copy of the war articles on a monthly basis and

501
00:33:49,121 --> 00:33:53,104
be it further resolved that the item be added to the reports due section of the council agenda.

502
00:33:53,545 --> 00:33:54,125
Councilor Knight.

503
00:33:54,565 --> 00:33:55,827
Mr. President, thank you very much.

504
00:33:55,847 --> 00:34:01,471
As you're well aware, we pass a budget every year and that budget says we're gonna spend money on this and we're gonna spend money on that.

505
00:34:01,952 --> 00:34:04,834
But then we sit here and we say, how much money did we give KP Law?

506
00:34:07,036 --> 00:34:08,417
The Warren articles are what will tell us that.

507
00:34:08,577 --> 00:34:10,597
The Warren articles are what we spend our bills on every month.

508
00:34:10,998 --> 00:34:15,439
In other forms of government, sometimes the Warren articles have to be approved by the city council on a monthly basis.

509
00:34:15,479 --> 00:34:16,940
That's not the case here in the city of Medford.

510
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:26,524
However, the Warren articles are very telling as to what direction this community is going in, where our money is being spent, whether or not we're meeting the obligations, the goals that we've established through the budget process.

511
00:34:27,104 --> 00:34:30,365
So with that being said, Mr. President, I'd ask that this practice be reinstated.

512
00:34:30,805 --> 00:34:31,726
Again, this was an item that,

513
00:34:32,826 --> 00:34:37,650
And Alicia Nunley-Benjamin was providing us with previously before her departure from this community.

514
00:34:38,151 --> 00:34:40,593
And it showed us quite a bit of information.

515
00:34:40,893 --> 00:34:51,383
I do believe when we reviewed this information last time, we found that there were a number of lawsuits that were settled that were over the sum of $2,500, which require council approval that were never brought before the council, for example.

516
00:34:51,943 --> 00:34:55,346
So there's a lot of spending practices that are going on here that I think we need to take a closer look at.

517
00:34:55,787 --> 00:34:58,309
And the Warren articles will be very telling to us as to what direction

518
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:07,263
our communities going in and whether or not we're adopting the generally accepted accounting principles that are so recommended in municipal government.

519
00:35:07,363 --> 00:35:10,264
So with that being said, I asked my council colleagues to support this resolution.

520
00:35:13,004 --> 00:35:13,745
Any discussion?

521
00:35:15,205 --> 00:35:15,825
Is there a second?

522
00:35:16,526 --> 00:35:16,766
Second.

523
00:35:17,526 --> 00:35:20,607
On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Carabiello.

524
00:35:22,668 --> 00:35:26,329
Seeing no further discussion, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll, or Councilor Sang.

525
00:35:27,249 --> 00:35:27,689
Oh, no.

526
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:28,510
Oh, okay.

527
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:29,450
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

528
00:35:31,293 --> 00:35:31,914
Councilor Kerrio?

529
00:35:32,014 --> 00:35:32,655
Yes.

530
00:35:33,456 --> 00:35:34,037
Councilor Collins?

531
00:35:34,297 --> 00:35:34,478
Yes.

532
00:35:35,379 --> 00:35:35,880
Councilor Nikes?

533
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:36,320
Yes.

534
00:35:37,061 --> 00:35:37,762
Councilor Scarpelli?

535
00:35:37,883 --> 00:35:38,243
Yes.

536
00:35:38,704 --> 00:35:39,205
Councilor Sanchez?

537
00:35:39,385 --> 00:35:39,605
Yes.

538
00:35:40,246 --> 00:35:40,927
President Morrell?

539
00:35:41,268 --> 00:35:41,508
Yes.

540
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:43,711
Vice President Paris?

541
00:35:43,871 --> 00:35:47,376
Yes, 70 affirmative, none in the negative, the motion passes.

542
00:35:48,539 --> 00:35:51,060
22-028 offered by Councilor Knight.

543
00:35:51,520 --> 00:36:03,866
Whereas the City of Medford has adopted provisions of Mass General Law, Chapter 59, Section 5K, allowing for the reduction of property tax obligations of persons over age 60 in exchange for volunteer services, also known as the Senior Workoff Program.

544
00:36:04,406 --> 00:36:09,609
And whereas the same benefit may be extended to veterans and in certain instances their spouse with the adoption of a local option,

545
00:36:10,129 --> 00:36:25,900
being further resolved that the City Solicitor and City Assessor appear before the Council to outline the required process for our Medford City Council to adopt the provisions of Mass General Law, Chapter 59, Section 5N, allowing for the reduction of property tax obligation of veterans in exchange for volunteer services.

546
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:32,164
The text of Chapter 59, Section 5K is, for Chapter 59, is below for reference purposes.

547
00:36:32,244 --> 00:36:32,725
Councilor Nay.

548
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:34,725
Mr. President, thank you very much.

549
00:36:35,246 --> 00:36:52,311
Under the Burke administration, the city of Medford a very successful senior work off program and the senior work off program provided senior citizens in this community with the opportunity to volunteer their services here for the city in exchange for an abatement on their property taxes up to I believe it was 1000 or $1500 per person.

550
00:36:53,291 --> 00:36:55,332
This program, I believe has been discontinued.

551
00:36:56,622 --> 00:36:59,625
in light of probably COVID and a number of other factors.

552
00:37:00,306 --> 00:37:05,210
But this is a benefit that with the adoption of a local option, we can extend to veterans here in this community as well.

553
00:37:06,031 --> 00:37:07,613
And I think that that would be a good thing, Mr. President.

554
00:37:07,653 --> 00:37:10,936
We have a number of veterans in this community, over 2,000 veterans reside in the city of Metro.

555
00:37:11,798 --> 00:37:21,789
And I think if we can take the appropriate steps to adopt a provision like this and then request that the administration implement, I will be able to provide some property tax relief to a number of people that served our country.

556
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:32,581
So I'm asking if the council support this measure and I'm hoping that we can move post haste to have a meeting with the solicitor and the assessor to determine what steps we need to take to appropriately implement.

557
00:37:34,823 --> 00:37:36,304
Thank you Councilor Nye, Councilor Stroud.

558
00:37:36,484 --> 00:37:36,805
Thank you.

559
00:37:36,825 --> 00:37:39,147
Thank you Councilor Nye for bringing this forward.

560
00:37:39,768 --> 00:37:46,596
I think that with the senior abatement program, it works so well for so many residents that need that support.

561
00:37:47,236 --> 00:37:55,606
And I know that Councilor Carviela works so closely with veteran services and realizing how many talented

562
00:37:56,174 --> 00:38:10,182
veterans we have in this community and the ability for them to come out and use their expertise to maybe work with our kids at the vocational school or work with the recreation department, programming, or even here at City Hall.

563
00:38:10,222 --> 00:38:19,288
So especially what we're seeing in today's society, I think it would be important that we give back to the people that gave us so much.

564
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:22,189
And I would second the motion, Councilor Ioannoni.

565
00:38:22,229 --> 00:38:23,190
Thank you for bringing that forward.

566
00:38:24,726 --> 00:38:28,389
Just to clarify, Councilor Knight, is your motion to approve to refer to Committee of the Whole?

567
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:31,972
I think if you read the text of it, because it's wicked long, I don't blame you for missing it.

568
00:38:33,934 --> 00:38:37,196
The solicitor and the assessor appear before the Council without lining up for upper steps.

569
00:38:37,336 --> 00:38:38,177
In a regular session.

570
00:38:38,377 --> 00:38:39,318
Yeah, in a regular session.

571
00:38:39,478 --> 00:38:40,219
I mean, that's fine.

572
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:41,120
Either way, it's fine with me.

573
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,621
I'd like to do it in regular session.

574
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,863
If there's no, doesn't sound like there's going to be much opposition to it.

575
00:38:45,903 --> 00:38:47,945
If there's no opposition to it, we can do it in regular session.

576
00:38:48,145 --> 00:38:49,306
Certainly no opposition from me.

577
00:38:49,666 --> 00:38:50,267
All right.

578
00:38:50,547 --> 00:38:52,929
On the motion, Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

579
00:38:55,298 --> 00:39:02,725
I want to thank Councillor Knight for bringing this forward and thank both Councillors Knight and Scarpelli for what they've said so far tonight.

580
00:39:03,846 --> 00:39:09,852
Again, this I think would be a great program for veterans in our city.

581
00:39:10,172 --> 00:39:13,836
I also think that this is about giving back to those who served us.

582
00:39:13,856 --> 00:39:15,197
I think this is also about

583
00:39:16,398 --> 00:39:17,599
justice and equity as well.

584
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:29,266
We know for a fact that those who serve our country are disproportionately working class, disproportionately people of color, disproportionately marginalized.

585
00:39:29,506 --> 00:39:36,830
We know that when they come back from service, that we as a society don't always treat them the way that they should be treated.

586
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:41,773
Our government isn't always there to support them, to give them the support they deserve.

587
00:39:45,155 --> 00:39:49,998
And so this, I think, is a step in the right direction, and I will be voting in favor of this.

588
00:39:50,979 --> 00:39:52,840
Thank you, Councilor Seng.

589
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,161
Nice for the veterans to get the support in City Hall.

590
00:39:56,182 --> 00:39:57,283
Thank you, Mr. President.

591
00:39:57,463 --> 00:39:59,364
Again, thank you, Councilor, for bringing this forward.

592
00:40:00,145 --> 00:40:04,087
You know, the senior program has been a great program for the seniors in our city.

593
00:40:04,667 --> 00:40:10,231
Not only helps them with their tax bills, but, you know, it gives them a chance to be productive in the community.

594
00:40:10,251 --> 00:40:13,393
You know, they work here, they work at schools, they work at the senior center.

595
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:15,253
It's a good thing for them.

596
00:40:15,593 --> 00:40:19,814
And now to bring our veterans into this is also a good thing too.

597
00:40:20,354 --> 00:40:26,456
I mean, these are men and women who served that country and they have skills to give back.

598
00:40:27,256 --> 00:40:34,898
So, you know, again, give them the same opportunity as everyone else gets, you know, some of them aren't working, some of them are retired, but again, they have skills.

599
00:40:35,198 --> 00:40:36,458
They want to be involved in the community.

600
00:40:36,858 --> 00:40:39,079
And I think we should continue to involve them in the community.

601
00:40:39,539 --> 00:40:41,179
And I will support this program tonight.

602
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:42,921
Thank you, Councilor Carvillo.

603
00:40:42,981 --> 00:40:43,721
President Morrell.

604
00:40:44,562 --> 00:40:45,323
Thank you, Mr. President.

605
00:40:45,383 --> 00:40:47,324
And thanks, Councilor Knight, for bringing this forward.

606
00:40:47,344 --> 00:40:51,648
I think this is a great idea, and I appreciate your research and awareness on this.

607
00:40:51,728 --> 00:41:01,836
I just want to check procedurally if this is something we want to address in a regular session, would this be something that would be reintroduced or tabled until those representatives can join us?

608
00:41:07,733 --> 00:41:12,976
Well, the paper before us would be the disposition of the paper would be asking them to appeal before us and give us a presentation.

609
00:41:12,996 --> 00:41:15,077
So we dispose of the paper, send it to the administration.

610
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:18,279
We're ready to come back to you with the answer.

611
00:41:18,879 --> 00:41:19,239
Okay, great.

612
00:41:19,259 --> 00:41:22,321
Yeah, I just wanted to make sure this doesn't get lost in the process.

613
00:41:22,381 --> 00:41:23,742
Okay, thank you for that clarification.

614
00:41:26,603 --> 00:41:26,804
Great.

615
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:30,245
On the motion of Councillor Knight, seconded by Councillor Scarpelli.

616
00:41:30,286 --> 00:41:31,386
Is there any further discussion?

617
00:41:34,168 --> 00:41:36,409
Any discussion from members of the public?

618
00:41:41,179 --> 00:41:42,480
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

619
00:41:45,741 --> 00:41:45,921
Yes.

620
00:41:45,941 --> 00:41:46,081
Yes.

621
00:41:46,121 --> 00:41:46,362
Yes.

622
00:41:46,622 --> 00:41:47,142
Yes.

623
00:41:47,782 --> 00:41:48,082
Yes.

624
00:41:48,162 --> 00:41:48,483
Yes.

625
00:41:48,663 --> 00:41:48,803
Yes.

626
00:41:57,875 --> 00:41:59,636
Yes 70 affirmative, zero in the negative.

627
00:41:59,676 --> 00:42:00,677
The motion passes.

628
00:42:00,697 --> 00:42:03,399
22-029 offered by Councilor Carabiello.

629
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:11,925
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council have the DOT slash DCR clean route 16 from the Meadow Glen Mall to the Condon Shell of all rubbish and debris.

630
00:42:12,106 --> 00:42:12,966
Councilor Carabiello.

631
00:42:13,947 --> 00:42:14,467
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

632
00:42:14,487 --> 00:42:16,709
Mr. President, something I bring up a couple of times a year.

633
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:21,353
You drive down route 16, as soon as you cross over the bridge,

634
00:42:22,343 --> 00:42:28,866
All you look at the side of the road you see rubbish all over the place mattresses things, and it goes like that all the way down to the cotton show.

635
00:42:29,526 --> 00:42:38,530
I asked over the summer that they at least trim the trees on me that the bushes and things on on the credit bridge and then none of that ever happens.

636
00:42:39,496 --> 00:42:40,517
Again, disappointed with them.

637
00:42:41,218 --> 00:42:48,865
Again, I say, again, you just drive down this filth, filth all on both sides of the road.

638
00:42:48,906 --> 00:42:52,109
I don't know if it's the DOT, DCI, whichever one wants to take responsibility.

639
00:42:52,489 --> 00:42:52,910
They don't do it.

640
00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:56,533
They'll come down, they'll clean up a little section, and then they stop right there.

641
00:42:56,753 --> 00:42:58,055
But it continues all the way down.

642
00:42:59,396 --> 00:43:02,959
All on that whole medium ship is crap all over the place, crap on the side of the road.

643
00:43:04,761 --> 00:43:12,227
I would say also, amend this to, send this to our state delegation to get them to come out there and clean this.

644
00:43:13,288 --> 00:43:19,214
It can be cleaned now, that I say, I mean, the amount of rubbish that sits on the side of the road is an eyesore.

645
00:43:19,714 --> 00:43:24,058
It should be cleaned up, and our city deserves better than what we're getting.

646
00:43:27,518 --> 00:43:32,499
Mr. President, I do believe that that area would be referred to as a sleepy hollow.

647
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:48,483
And if it's my understanding, there is a maintenance agreement between the DCR and the city of Medford, where the city of Medford actually agrees to maintain and control the cleanliness of that area, if I'm not mistaken.

648
00:43:49,204 --> 00:43:51,924
I see the DOT down there cleaning it, but they've been down there.

649
00:43:53,205 --> 00:43:54,625
But right now, no one's cleaning it again.

650
00:43:56,037 --> 00:44:05,261
are, just for my clarity, this is a, are you referring to the park across the footbridge behind Medford Square?

651
00:44:09,243 --> 00:44:11,424
Is that when you say sleeping on the condon shell?

652
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:13,344
Right, right, right.

653
00:44:13,404 --> 00:44:15,065
I think that this is actually about the,

654
00:44:17,947 --> 00:44:19,909
expressway for lack of a better word.

655
00:44:19,949 --> 00:44:20,469
I'm sorry.

656
00:44:20,609 --> 00:44:21,090
Okay.

657
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:21,650
I got to look.

658
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:22,050
All right.

659
00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:22,431
Yeah.

660
00:44:22,711 --> 00:44:25,433
And it goes from that part of the road that goes all the way down to there.

661
00:44:25,773 --> 00:44:27,975
There's crap all over, there's crap on the islands.

662
00:44:28,395 --> 00:44:30,377
So you go by, there's mattresses on the side of the road.

663
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:31,177
I mean, it's, it's.

664
00:44:31,538 --> 00:44:31,678
Yeah.

665
00:44:31,718 --> 00:44:34,100
You're, you're talking about exit 31 and then.

666
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:34,460
Yeah.

667
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:34,880
Yeah.

668
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:39,163
As soon as you cross over the bridge there, it's a mess.

669
00:44:39,484 --> 00:44:42,726
From the middle of the mall to when you get off the exit, crap all over the road.

670
00:44:43,507 --> 00:44:43,687
Yeah.

671
00:44:45,407 --> 00:44:51,230
Yeah, and I think it's both sides, it's the side behind the police station, DPW, and the other side of 93.

672
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:52,890
Yeah, it's a total mess.

673
00:44:53,711 --> 00:44:54,071
Thank you.

674
00:44:54,491 --> 00:44:55,712
Thank you, Councilor Kerrio.

675
00:44:55,852 --> 00:44:56,732
Any further discussion?

676
00:44:57,692 --> 00:44:58,213
Councilor Sang?

677
00:44:58,833 --> 00:45:04,395
Just wanted to agree, and just note that this is also an environmental issue, the amount of pollution that's out there.

678
00:45:05,776 --> 00:45:06,376
Absolutely.

679
00:45:07,076 --> 00:45:07,937
Any further discussion?

680
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:12,184
I said I would not do this, but I'm gonna do it.

681
00:45:13,245 --> 00:45:18,790
It's a pet peeve of mine, the condition, especially with state controlled roads in our community.

682
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:25,576
I'm not gonna, in previous times that you brought this up, I've amended this to list eight other places that we need cleaned or maintained.

683
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:31,060
And as a resident of a DCR road as well, I understand it.

684
00:45:33,324 --> 00:45:40,487
And what I'm about to say is not meant to be an excuse at all, but I was just reading today a report that DCR's funding has been cut almost 20% since 2009.

685
00:45:41,087 --> 00:45:43,588
And we're really seeing the impacts of that.

686
00:45:43,768 --> 00:45:46,649
I used to work with DCR workers through their union.

687
00:45:47,489 --> 00:45:52,431
They're seeing the impact at state parks and recreation facilities, on the parkways that DCR maintains.

688
00:45:52,711 --> 00:45:57,993
It's a severe issue, a severe budgetary issue, the austerity that's been imposed on DCR.

689
00:45:58,954 --> 00:46:02,135
So I'm not gonna file any amendments or anything to that effect tonight,

690
00:46:03,075 --> 00:46:19,101
Our DCR needs support, and I hope that MassDOT and DCR can come down and do this right now, but in the long run, unless the state takes action, which I'm glad you're referring this to state delegation, those budgets need to go up if we're gonna have the level of services that we deserve.

691
00:46:21,282 --> 00:46:23,603
On the motion of Councilor Caravaglio, seconded by?

692
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:25,903
Seconded by Councilor Sang.

693
00:46:25,964 --> 00:46:28,224
Mr. Clerk, as amended by Councilor Caravaglio.

694
00:46:28,364 --> 00:46:29,505
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

695
00:46:33,326 --> 00:46:33,647
Yes.

696
00:46:33,747 --> 00:46:33,867
Yes.

697
00:46:33,907 --> 00:46:34,087
Yes.

698
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:38,791
Yes.

699
00:46:38,811 --> 00:46:39,032
Yes.

700
00:46:39,272 --> 00:46:40,933
Yes.

701
00:46:41,174 --> 00:46:50,202
Yes 70 affirmative zero and the negative emotion passes 22 to 030 offered by Councillor Collins and Councillor saying.

702
00:46:58,868 --> 00:47:08,051
Whereas our city is in the process of moving forward from the December, 2021 holiday extravaganza, where an inaccurate and offensive image meant to depict the Hanukkah menorah was displayed.

703
00:47:08,651 --> 00:47:17,133
Whereas City Hall and all public venues must be spaces where people from any and all faith, cultural and ethnic backgrounds may feel an equal sense of welcome, inclusion, safety, and belonging.

704
00:47:17,153 --> 00:47:23,375
To be a resolve that the Medford City Council affirm the administration's renewed efforts to cultivate robust community engagement

705
00:47:23,855 --> 00:47:32,682
and the planning of municipal events and strengthen relationships with our city's many faith, cultural and ethnic community groups in order to make City Hall a more inclusive and welcoming space for all.

706
00:47:33,323 --> 00:47:45,893
Be it further resolved that the administration provide the Medford City Council with an update on its plans to improve community engagement and strengthen relationships with groups that are underrepresented in City Hall, including, but not limited to, Medford's Jewish communities.

707
00:47:45,993 --> 00:47:46,834
Councilor Collins.

708
00:47:48,095 --> 00:47:50,177
Thank you, Vice President Beers.

709
00:47:50,674 --> 00:47:52,276
Thank you for reading that whole thing.

710
00:47:54,037 --> 00:48:01,745
So this resolution is not intended to point fingers or rehash an incident that we already know about.

711
00:48:02,366 --> 00:48:07,852
This resolution is intended to follow up on the work that the administration has begun in the wake of the offensive menorah display.

712
00:48:08,392 --> 00:48:10,054
at the holiday extravaganza in December.

713
00:48:10,835 --> 00:48:25,872
We're aware that the administration has taken some good first steps and to move forward from that event, including starting the conversation with representatives from Temple Shalom da Marion Ryan, the anti defamation league and city hall staff and beginning to plan some trainings.

714
00:48:27,534 --> 00:48:43,370
My intent is to affirm that the goal here should be to create a culture of inclusion and broad community engagement within City Hall, and with the planning of city events specifically, so much so that offensive incidents like the menorah display are just not possible to happen anymore.

715
00:48:44,271 --> 00:49:03,475
aspire for this administration to have such strong relationships across our many faith and cultural and ethnic communities and be so and get so good at inviting people into City Hall and to our event planning processes that this kind of unfortunate yet human error wouldn't ever make it into the final version of a city event.

716
00:49:04,155 --> 00:49:09,216
So I'm happy to see that the work to move forward has begun and we want to confirm that this work is really necessary.

717
00:49:10,076 --> 00:49:28,367
not just because of the menorah display and to heal ties with the Jewish community members who were alienated by it, but rather that, you know, to say that it's necessary in any case to make this city hall a place where people from any background can feel represented and feel belonging because that's what a city hall really needs to be to be successful.

718
00:49:28,888 --> 00:49:37,093
So finally, you know, we want to request that update from the administration on what the next steps are to continue improving inclusion and engagement with the community.

719
00:49:37,133 --> 00:49:37,393
Thank you.

720
00:49:38,877 --> 00:49:39,597
Thank you, Councilor Collins.

721
00:49:39,637 --> 00:49:40,238
Councilor Sang?

722
00:49:42,259 --> 00:49:52,704
It's difficult to follow up such an eloquent explanation of this resolution, but I just wanted to give a little bit of anecdotal experience about growing up here in Medford.

723
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:58,707
As someone who came from a different faith and cultural background, it wasn't always easy.

724
00:49:58,747 --> 00:50:01,068
And you know, you would never, you

725
00:50:01,928 --> 00:50:06,733
You wouldn't always have accurate depictions of your culture or the culture in which you grew up in.

726
00:50:07,934 --> 00:50:16,483
But I am happy that our city has been making progress on this front over the last decade, especially.

727
00:50:16,783 --> 00:50:20,787
And I just wanted to acknowledge that there's still a lot of work to be done.

728
00:50:22,369 --> 00:50:34,947
And our, you know, communities of faith or cultural communities, ethnic communities here are counting on us to be the leaders in making sure that we get this right and that we build a city that's as inclusive as possible.

729
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:42,412
There's a lot that we haven't talked about as a city that I think merits discussion.

730
00:50:42,832 --> 00:50:44,953
Antisemitism is one of those topics.

731
00:50:45,013 --> 00:50:57,197
We've had recorded incidents of antisemitism in this city, of antisemitic attacks, violence, depictions.

732
00:50:58,078 --> 00:51:04,400
Very unfortunately, we've had swastikas carved into fence posts and public spaces here.

733
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:08,002
and it's time for us to step up and address all these issues.

734
00:51:08,202 --> 00:51:24,672
And so I'm, you know, we're, Councilor Collins and I are here today to make sure that, to reaffirm the work that our city is doing so far and to make sure that we are moving forward and we're challenging ourselves to move as inclusive a direction as possible.

735
00:51:24,692 --> 00:51:27,293
Thank you, Councilor Sang.

736
00:51:28,474 --> 00:51:31,436
Seconded on the motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Knight.

737
00:51:32,356 --> 00:51:33,137
Any further discussion?

738
00:51:34,119 --> 00:51:34,801
Councilor Scarpelli.

739
00:51:34,882 --> 00:51:36,287
Real quick, thank you for bringing this forward.

740
00:51:36,869 --> 00:51:40,642
I think it's important that what Councilor Collins mentioned that

741
00:51:41,514 --> 00:51:44,837
people have to realize that this building is for everyone.

742
00:51:45,457 --> 00:51:59,668
And having the opportunity for this building to represent everybody and that it gives everybody an opportunity to come here and express how they feel or what they feel what's going on in the city, how they can, how we can make it better.

743
00:51:59,688 --> 00:52:06,393
And, you know, this past holiday event where unfortunately,

744
00:52:07,308 --> 00:52:10,829
There was some unfortunate misrepresentations.

745
00:52:10,889 --> 00:52:22,073
I think that it's good to see that the city moving forward and openly discussing it and sharing it with the community and the plans and how we can correct this so it doesn't happen again.

746
00:52:22,173 --> 00:52:23,294
So thank you.

747
00:52:24,514 --> 00:52:25,574
Thank you, councilor Scarpelli.

748
00:52:26,335 --> 00:52:32,737
Any further discussion on the motion of councilor Collins and councilor saying seconded.

749
00:52:32,777 --> 00:52:35,758
Well, technically the motion of councilor Collins seconded by councilor Knight.

750
00:52:36,253 --> 00:52:37,434
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

751
00:52:39,635 --> 00:52:39,775
Yes.

752
00:52:39,795 --> 00:52:39,875
Yes.

753
00:52:40,075 --> 00:52:40,255
Yes.

754
00:52:40,435 --> 00:52:40,755
Yes.

755
00:52:41,636 --> 00:52:41,816
Yes.

756
00:52:41,836 --> 00:52:41,916
Yes.

757
00:52:41,976 --> 00:52:42,276
Yes.

758
00:52:42,496 --> 00:52:42,636
Yes.

759
00:52:55,214 --> 00:52:58,175
22-031 offered by Councilor Sang.

760
00:52:58,235 --> 00:53:08,137
Be it resolved that the city council ask the city administration for an update on COVID-19 response plans for city senior living facilities given the recent surge in COVID-19 cases.

761
00:53:08,197 --> 00:53:08,777
Councilor Sang.

762
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:09,797
Thank you, Mr. President.

763
00:53:10,517 --> 00:53:15,098
Last week we hit in our state record highs in terms of COVID-19 cases.

764
00:53:15,218 --> 00:53:22,600
And even though we know that the circumstances are different from where we were two years ago, there are still community concerns about

765
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:29,024
on the spread of COVID-19 and the risk that this poses to our senior citizens living in senior living facilities here.

766
00:53:29,605 --> 00:53:33,768
And so, especially given previous records, both in the city and nationally.

767
00:53:34,228 --> 00:53:44,335
And so I propose this resolution to make sure that we are all informed as a community as to what our city is doing to make sure that our senior citizens are as safe as possible.

768
00:53:46,295 --> 00:53:46,935
Councilor Carviello.

769
00:53:48,176 --> 00:53:55,277
If my fellow council would like, would amend that to also include the nursing homes that we have in the city of Medford.

770
00:53:55,357 --> 00:54:01,399
My dad happens to be one of them and I just got an update from one of them this afternoon saying how many people are sick in there.

771
00:54:01,779 --> 00:54:07,341
So if you wouldn't mind amending that to bring in the nursing homes that are in the city of Medford also.

772
00:54:09,801 --> 00:54:10,782
Thank you, Councilor Carviello.

773
00:54:11,062 --> 00:54:11,482
Councilor Nye.

774
00:54:11,973 --> 00:54:20,779
Yes, Mr. President, I too would like to amend this further, just by asking that the administration respond to the Council in writing and then post it on the city website as well.

775
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:26,303
So this information can be readily available to citizens in the community have concerns about their loved ones and such facilities.

776
00:54:27,704 --> 00:54:30,386
That was to respond in writing and post on the city website.

777
00:54:32,367 --> 00:54:33,208
Any further discussion.

778
00:54:38,384 --> 00:54:42,105
just for my sake, I definitely support this.

779
00:54:43,546 --> 00:54:50,748
And I noted today that governor Baker extended a booster mandate to people working in facilities like these.

780
00:54:51,208 --> 00:54:56,169
So that is one thing I heard today, but definitely a lot of concerns from a lot of folks around this issue.

781
00:54:57,209 --> 00:55:04,632
On the motion of councilor Seng, seconded by councilor Scarpelli, as amended by councilor Carviello and councilor Knight.

782
00:55:04,792 --> 00:55:05,972
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

783
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:09,521
Yes.

784
00:55:12,524 --> 00:55:12,764
Yes.

785
00:55:17,590 --> 00:55:17,830
Yes.

786
00:55:19,632 --> 00:55:19,892
Yes.

787
00:55:21,093 --> 00:55:21,754
Yes.

788
00:55:22,094 --> 00:55:22,375
Yes.

789
00:55:22,495 --> 00:55:23,436
Yes, 70 affirmative.

790
00:55:23,456 --> 00:55:24,797
Sir, the negative emotion passes.

791
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:47,524
22034 offered by counselor saying whereas public health experts continue to recommend masking to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and whereas numerous public health experts now recommend that people wear KN95 and N95 masks given the spread of the Omicron variant, be it resolved that the Medford City Council ask the city administration to acquire KN95 masks approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health

792
00:55:47,984 --> 00:55:59,687
and to develop a plan to distribute KN-95 masks to priority groups, including municipal and school workers, individuals at a higher risk for severe COVID-19, and residents to whom purchasing masks presents a financial burden.

793
00:55:59,888 --> 00:56:00,508
Councillor Tsai.

794
00:56:00,908 --> 00:56:01,788
Thank you, Mr. President.

795
00:56:02,228 --> 00:56:05,169
We know that Omicron is a more transmissible variant.

796
00:56:05,489 --> 00:56:07,650
We're seeing the results of that in our case count today.

797
00:56:09,091 --> 00:56:22,926
We also today, the CDC officials have confirmed that they are looking at updating mask guidance to recommend N95 and KN95 masks be worn.

798
00:56:23,987 --> 00:56:27,151
And experts at top medical institutions have raised

799
00:56:27,651 --> 00:56:38,355
this issue that we should be we should be distributing more KN95 masks to everyone and making sure that we are wearing these more protective masks.

800
00:56:38,875 --> 00:56:46,077
You know it's given given all of these all the recent recommendations and given the possible change in guidance from the CDC.

801
00:56:47,978 --> 00:56:50,079
It's going to be harder and harder to secure masks.

802
00:56:50,299 --> 00:56:57,402
I mean, it's already difficult for many people to figure out what's a counterfeit mask and what's not to secure those orders online.

803
00:56:57,422 --> 00:57:03,404
And I'm proposing this because I think we need to keep our workers safe.

804
00:57:03,464 --> 00:57:05,145
I think we need to keep us all safe.

805
00:57:06,165 --> 00:57:13,087
I think we need to mitigate the financial burden that mask buying can pose to a lot of working class families in this town.

806
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:20,069
And I also believe that if we are asking people to mask as a city, we should give them the means to do so.

807
00:57:20,810 --> 00:57:30,913
And again, we need to address the problem of counterfeits, which is why I added the line about the National Institute for Occupational Safety.

808
00:57:33,472 --> 00:57:49,684
We, I left out N95 masks because currently CDC guidance does not recommend that we stockpile N95 masks because they are, they should be treated as priority for medical staff.

809
00:57:50,504 --> 00:57:57,570
I just wanted to be transparent about that point and explain why this resolution focuses on KN95 masks.

810
00:58:00,512 --> 00:58:01,372
Thank you, Councilor Seng.

811
00:58:01,412 --> 00:58:01,973
Councilor Collins.

812
00:58:02,865 --> 00:58:05,688
Thank you and thank you councillor saying for bringing this forward.

813
00:58:06,108 --> 00:58:09,111
I think that this is a great thing to see the city lead on.

814
00:58:10,072 --> 00:58:20,883
I too have heard the recent guidance about how it's true, and 95, but you know more to the point KN 95 are more protective and surgical masks they're certainly more protective and cloth masks.

815
00:58:21,463 --> 00:58:32,170
And I think at the point that you know we're trying to the administration is trying to do all it can to keep our residents, safe, correct masking is a huge part of that.

816
00:58:32,630 --> 00:58:39,175
And we have to evolve our guidance with the evolving nature of the virus with the infection levels in our community and I think

817
00:58:39,595 --> 00:58:44,658
Councilor Seng brings up a great point that it's increasingly difficult to find masks.

818
00:58:44,718 --> 00:58:58,687
And I think people are feeling kind of out in the wind when it comes to being able to source masks that will protect them, that will help them not keep the virus, not bring the virus home to their families, you know, kind of regardless of vaccination status, because that's where we're at in this pandemic.

819
00:58:59,728 --> 00:59:07,813
So I think if there is a, if there's a way for this administration to source masks so that we can better protect the people in our community,

820
00:59:08,593 --> 00:59:20,139
that are most in need of them, people who can't work from home, people who work for the municipality, work for our schools, people who are disproportionately likely to be in infection prone scenarios.

821
00:59:20,919 --> 00:59:24,941
We need to be doing all that we can to help protect those community members.

822
00:59:25,622 --> 00:59:28,863
So thank you, Councilor Sang, and I'll be strong in support of this today.

823
00:59:30,804 --> 00:59:33,646
Any further discussion, Councilor President Morrell.

824
00:59:34,346 --> 00:59:35,066
Thank you, Mr. President.

825
00:59:35,086 --> 00:59:36,867
I want to thank Councilor Sang for bringing this forward.

826
00:59:36,887 --> 00:59:37,668
I actually raised

827
00:59:38,587 --> 00:59:44,611
similar concerns about access and costs way back when, with the original mask mandates being put into place.

828
00:59:45,492 --> 00:59:49,815
And I thank him for leaning on the administration to see what they can do here.

829
00:59:50,095 --> 00:59:56,439
As with many things, unfortunately, it seems like the city and municipalities are the last line of defense with the least amount of funding.

830
00:59:56,499 --> 01:00:04,485
So I would hope that our state leaders and our leaders at the federal level are looking into this as well, as they have vastly more funding than the city of Medford.

831
01:00:05,383 --> 01:00:08,906
I appreciate the assay administration and I really hope this is something we can do.

832
01:00:08,926 --> 01:00:09,487
So thank you.

833
01:00:11,428 --> 01:00:12,569
Thank you, President Morrell.

834
01:00:12,649 --> 01:00:13,630
Any further discussion?

835
01:00:13,650 --> 01:00:18,794
I'm just gonna put one more piece of information out there.

836
01:00:18,834 --> 01:00:23,238
There's an incredibly helpful chart published in the Wall Street Journal last week.

837
01:00:24,933 --> 01:00:35,797
If you have one person who is infected and one person who's not infected, standing about six feet apart, if neither of them are wearing any sort of mask, it will take about 15 minutes to transmit a infectious dose.

838
01:00:36,697 --> 01:00:39,638
If they're both wearing cloth masks, it would take about 27 minutes.

839
01:00:40,199 --> 01:00:42,540
If they're both wearing surgical masks, it would take about one hour.

840
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:50,202
If they're both wearing a non-fit tested KN95 or N95, it would take 25 hours to transmit.

841
01:00:50,262 --> 01:00:51,723
So it's a significant increase

842
01:00:52,463 --> 01:00:55,924
in protection if, you know, with a little bit of a change to the mask that you're wearing.

843
01:00:56,724 --> 01:01:03,885
If you're using a tightly sealed fitted N95, if both people are using that, you would have 2,500 hours of protection.

844
01:01:04,045 --> 01:01:10,327
So it's a really significant difference between the different types of masking.

845
01:01:11,207 --> 01:01:16,468
So that was just really a helpful way for me to learn about that.

846
01:01:18,277 --> 01:01:24,218
Seeing no further discussion on the motion of Councillor saying seconded by Councillor Collins.

847
01:01:25,179 --> 01:01:26,319
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

848
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:31,260
Yes.

849
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:31,740
Yes.

850
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:32,300
Yes.

851
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:33,940
Yes.

852
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:34,441
Yes.

853
01:01:44,222 --> 01:01:46,107
Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

854
01:01:46,127 --> 01:01:46,849
The motion passes.

855
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:48,955
22-035 offered by Councilor Sang.

856
01:01:51,204 --> 01:02:15,486
Whereas Mayor Loco Kern and the Medford Board of Health have declared racism to be a public health crisis, and whereas the Center for Disease Control cites more COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, deaths, and mental health challenges in areas where racial and ethnic minority groups live, learn, work, play, and worship, explained through discrimination, limited healthcare access and use, occupational, educational income and wealth gaps, and crowded housing conditions,

857
01:02:16,046 --> 01:02:37,013
be it resolved that the Medford City Council ask for an update from the city administration on its plans to achieve an equitable response to the current COVID-19 surge, and be it further resolved that the Medford City Council ask the city administration to increase free COVID-19 testing, vaccination opportunities, contact tracing, and public information efforts in the neighborhoods and communities that are disproportionately lower income and or non-white.

858
01:02:37,153 --> 01:02:38,013
Councilor Sang.

859
01:02:38,566 --> 01:02:39,407
Thank you, Mr. President.

860
01:02:39,967 --> 01:03:04,148
Where our statements give much of the reason for this resolution, we know that when we look at the effect of COVID-19, when we look at the spread, the severity, when we look at numbers such as vaccination rates, we see that working class communities and non-white communities have been suffering disproportionately from the COVID-19 pandemic.

861
01:03:04,548 --> 01:03:06,209
Medford is no exception to this rule.

862
01:03:07,089 --> 01:03:14,771
There is unfortunately a vaccination gap in town for the BIPOC community.

863
01:03:15,152 --> 01:03:21,674
We also know that there's more that we can do as a city to address these issues.

864
01:03:22,794 --> 01:03:28,396
The city council and the city government labeled racism as a public health crisis.

865
01:03:28,476 --> 01:03:29,956
I think this is following up on that

866
01:03:32,618 --> 01:03:55,649
action back last year or back then, I believe that we need to be consistent in our actions and that by uplifting the working class, by uplifting BIPOC folks, by uplifting marginalized folks, we are uplifting us, all of us, and keeping all of us safer, keeping every single one of us safer.

867
01:03:59,103 --> 01:04:01,145
I that's why I'm putting this forward.

868
01:04:01,245 --> 01:04:06,429
I'm aware that the city has taken a few measures on this front.

869
01:04:06,549 --> 01:04:17,917
We, the city administration's let me know that they have, they've increased some public public health information campaigns in

870
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:26,094
neighborhoods of color, they have been working with faith leaders and community leaders to make sure that we are vaccinating as many people as possible.

871
01:04:26,635 --> 01:04:32,677
But I think many of us have the question of what what comes next, how are we responding to the surge?

872
01:04:32,717 --> 01:04:33,317
How can we?

873
01:04:33,557 --> 01:04:35,138
How can we help as a city council?

874
01:04:35,198 --> 01:04:36,438
How can we help as a community?

875
01:04:37,138 --> 01:04:38,799
And how can we do better?

876
01:04:38,839 --> 01:04:41,080
And how can we evaluate what we're doing?

877
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:43,901
So this is why I'm putting this forward today.

878
01:04:45,962 --> 01:04:46,882
Thank you, Councilor Sang.

879
01:04:48,401 --> 01:04:49,202
Any discussion?

880
01:04:49,522 --> 01:04:50,263
Councilor Collins.

881
01:04:51,164 --> 01:04:52,065
Thank you, Councilor Sang.

882
01:04:52,125 --> 01:05:03,196
And, you know, I think some of the last points that you raised really speak to the heart of this, which is, you know, what being able to track and assess what are we doing, what's left to do, how can we help more?

883
01:05:03,236 --> 01:05:07,500
And I also want to echo a comment that President Morrell made on the previous paper.

884
01:05:08,074 --> 01:05:14,397
regarding how truly tragic it is that so much of the pandemic response has been left to local governments.

885
01:05:15,678 --> 01:05:23,501
And I certainly hope that we can take these lessons forward as a nation for our next, God forbid, public health emergency.

886
01:05:23,581 --> 01:05:32,846
But as the case is that a lot of responsibility has fallen on the shoulders of our local boards of health nationwide, we still need to be saying, how can we bring up the baseline?

887
01:05:33,206 --> 01:05:35,347
How can we make sure that we're achieving an equitable response

888
01:05:35,687 --> 01:05:37,388
how much more can we be doing?

889
01:05:37,408 --> 01:05:55,196
So I'd love to see this administration look into keeping up the vaccination clinics, continuing to reevaluate our mask mandates, ability to share and distribute medical resources, looking into PCR testing for our community, the things that are very, very hard for residents to find on their own.

890
01:05:56,076 --> 01:05:57,897
So thank you again for bringing this up, Councilor Sang.

891
01:06:00,058 --> 01:06:01,078
Thank you, Councilor Collins.

892
01:06:01,238 --> 01:06:02,119
Any further discussion?

893
01:06:06,034 --> 01:06:11,677
Seeing none, motion by Councillor Knight to approve, seconded by Councillor Scarpelli.

894
01:06:12,057 --> 01:06:13,138
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

895
01:06:34,977 --> 01:06:37,939
Yes, 70 affirmative, zero in the negative, motion passes.

896
01:06:38,739 --> 01:06:40,980
Is there a motion to take papers in the hands of the clerk?

897
01:06:43,082 --> 01:06:47,044
Motion by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Knight to take papers under suspension.

898
01:06:47,224 --> 01:06:48,284
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

899
01:06:58,890 --> 01:06:59,511
Councilor Kerrio?

900
01:06:59,631 --> 01:06:59,891
Yes.

901
01:07:00,891 --> 01:07:01,412
Councilor Collins?

902
01:07:01,652 --> 01:07:01,792
Yes.

903
01:07:04,367 --> 01:07:04,607
Yes.

904
01:07:05,788 --> 01:07:05,988
Yes.

905
01:07:07,609 --> 01:07:07,849
Yes.

906
01:07:10,290 --> 01:07:22,796
Yes, 70 affirmative zero and the negative motion passes 22 036 offered by Councilor Carvio be it resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate the Elliott Pearson Children's School at Tufts University on celebrating its 100th year.

907
01:07:23,316 --> 01:07:26,178
The Elliott Pearson School has served countless children and families in Medford.

908
01:07:26,578 --> 01:07:31,720
and the Elliott Pearson Children's School is one of the first nursery schools in the country and soon became a training school for new teachers.

909
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:38,622
The school has served as a high-quality laboratory and demonstration school, serving children from diverse backgrounds in Medford.

910
01:07:39,322 --> 01:07:55,608
The school also serves as a teacher training and research site for undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral students applying for scholarships to practice, being so resolved that the Medford City Council thanks the faculty and staff at the Elliott Pearson Children's School and congratulates them on 100 years of outstanding service to the children and families of Medford

911
01:07:55,968 --> 01:07:58,970
best wishes for the next 100 years, Councilor Garavaglio.

912
01:07:59,330 --> 01:08:00,090
Thank you, Mr. President.

913
01:08:00,110 --> 01:08:07,995
You know, Mr. President, I would guarantee a lot of people don't even know the Elliott Pearson School even exists in the city of Medford.

914
01:08:08,655 --> 01:08:14,218
This is a school that's been run by Tufts University for all these years, and again,

915
01:08:15,549 --> 01:08:24,892
Touch being the institution that it is, has put out high quality teachers, and this has been a study group for teachers and things like that.

916
01:08:25,852 --> 01:08:28,253
I was lucky to have a couple of my kids get to go there.

917
01:08:29,394 --> 01:08:34,375
That was maybe 30 years ago, but maybe a little longer, 40 years ago.

918
01:08:35,375 --> 01:08:38,136
And again, I'd say it's a good program.

919
01:08:38,356 --> 01:08:39,437
It's a quiet program.

920
01:08:39,537 --> 01:08:42,718
If you ask so many people, they probably don't even know that the place even exists.

921
01:08:43,542 --> 01:08:52,369
So again, I just want to thank Tufts and the students that go there and the things they learned there and their continued success.

922
01:08:53,610 --> 01:08:54,911
Thank you, Councilor Kerrio.

923
01:08:55,151 --> 01:08:56,152
Any further discussion?

924
01:08:57,913 --> 01:09:01,636
Motion approved by Councilor Kerrio, seconded by Councilor Knight.

925
01:09:02,937 --> 01:09:03,798
Any further discussion?

926
01:09:06,203 --> 01:09:08,764
Seeing none, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

927
01:09:10,285 --> 01:09:11,566
Yes.

928
01:09:11,706 --> 01:09:11,906
Yes.

929
01:09:14,668 --> 01:09:15,548
Yes.

930
01:09:15,688 --> 01:09:15,908
Yes.

931
01:09:17,449 --> 01:09:17,709
Yes.

932
01:09:20,611 --> 01:09:20,871
Yes.

933
01:09:21,231 --> 01:09:23,332
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

934
01:09:23,372 --> 01:09:24,333
The motion passes.

935
01:09:24,873 --> 01:09:26,094
Public participation.

936
01:09:26,954 --> 01:09:31,737
Is there anyone in the room or on Zoom who would like to participate?

937
01:09:39,404 --> 01:09:42,625
Seeing none, we'll move on to the records.

938
01:09:43,205 --> 01:09:47,266
