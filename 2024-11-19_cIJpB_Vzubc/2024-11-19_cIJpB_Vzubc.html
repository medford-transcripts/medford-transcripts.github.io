    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=426.944s">And</a>  Mr. President, I'll just reaffirm for people who didn't see this last week, in my discussions with the Mayor last year, for KP Law to represent the Council, it was the Council's request that we have a direct contact and not a go-between, and I think that was the holdup between on the $26,000, and it hasn't changed since then.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=451.758s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=452.599s">So</a>  if we could, I have the same question. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=455.121s">I</a>  think that if we can table this and call for a Committee of the Whole meeting before our meeting next week, a regular meeting, and ask the city solicitor and maybe the chief of staff, just to clarify, I think that this is important for the fact that what we asked for is a representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=475.358s">So</a>  we, at the time when this all occurred, didn't look like <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=480.492s">uneducated</a>  buffoons and dog chasing his tail when we had legal issues, not to battle against our own administration, but just to guide us on legal terms and legal movements as we had some concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=499.665s">So,</a>  I don't wanna see this, if this could be rectified in a committee of the whole meeting where, <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=510.455s">we</a>  can iron this out and make sure this is defined a little bit better. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=515.017s">So</a>  it does appease both parties and we could have someone that represents the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=519.779s">I</a>  think that would be amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=523.701s">I</a>  just don't want it to fail this evening and then sit again for a few months. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=527.703s">So</a>  my motion would be to table for committee of the whole meeting next week with the chief of staff in the city solicitor.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=539.025s">excuse</a>  me, we do have a committee of the whole already scheduled for next Tuesday at 5.30. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=544.249s">Kim</a>  Scanlon will be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=546.57s">It</a>  is regarding the elections commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=549.212s">So</a>  we will have her, we could discuss the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=553.295s">She</a>  is scheduled to be before us on the day.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=555.036s">Okay,</a>  well, I think it wouldn't be, I think it would just be a defining evening for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=559.92s">I</a>  don't think this would take too long, but if we can add that.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=564.943s">Gotcha.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=568.879s">There's</a>  a motion by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Ntuk-Table. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=572.461s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=574.342s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=576.123s">Before</a>  we vote, I'd just like to voice, you know, one thing that I heard from Chief of Staff Nazari in our discussion on this proposal last week was a concern that failure to quickly pass this budget amendment would <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=591.272s">leave</a>  the administration short on legal counsel in the short term or maybe for the rest of the fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=596.897s">So</a>  that is a concern of mine because I could see a lot of circumstances where having, you know, any department in the city having insufficient access to legal counsel on a variety of matters could really hold us up and, you know, any numerous important issues that we're trying to work on. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=612.21s">over</a>  the next five, six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=614.171s">So</a>  that is a concern of mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=617.172s">And</a>  that's why I'm leaning towards trying to pass this expediently, because I totally agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=621.753s">I'd</a>  like to see us lobby for independent counsel for this council going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=626.495s">But</a>  I do have pretty strong reservations about, you know, delaying passage of the amendment and ripple effects that that could have for the administration in the short term. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=635.998s">If</a>  I can point information with that.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=638.517s">Actually,</a>  the clerk has reminded me that a motion to table is not debatable. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=642.821s">I'm</a>  still getting up on my council rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=644.983s">So</a>  we will have to vote on that before we have further debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=648.806s">So,</a>  Mr. Clerk, on the motion to table, if you could please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=653.41s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello? <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=654.171s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=655.132s">Councilor</a>  Collins?</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=667.204s">Vice</a>  President Ferris.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=668.065s">No,</a>  three in the affirmative, four in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=670.747s">The</a>  motion is not tabled. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=672.768s">Councilor</a>  Snider.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=675.17s">No,</a>  it's disheartening for my fellow councilor, who's new to the process, who just shared some insight, those fears that we're leaving the city without legal representation for one week, when we wanna make sure, until you're sitting in this council, <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=692.743s">and</a>  I'm shocked with my veteran Councilors that sat here and watched our dogs chase the tail and how embarrassing it was for us to sit here for two meetings because we didn't have representation and how hard we fought during the budget meeting to get a line item that represented what we asked for and then to come back and something disingenuine to say that we're asking for, we're getting money, but it can't be used for what we're asking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=718.729s">It's</a>  just giving the city more money <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=722.75s">the</a>  negative ramifications we've seen with the assistance from KP law and different city functions. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=728.733s">So</a>  it's a little deciding to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=730.914s">I</a>  understand everybody has a vote and we've spoken. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=734.036s">So</a>  I will not vote for it because I think we needed a week to get better understanding with the chief of staff and the legal representation from the city to guide us when we have questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=745.982s">Okay,</a>  so if that, it is what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=748.283s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=750.184s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=752.898s">Any</a>  Councilors? <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=754.1s">Mr.</a>  President? <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=754.681s">Yes,</a>  President Morell.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=757.485s">I</a>  do see Chief of Staff, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=758.547s">Aaron,</a>  she is on the call right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=760.309s">I</a>  don't know if Councilors have questions at the moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=763.173s">I</a>  just want to point that out.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=766.759s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=767.58s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=768.507s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=769.988s">Again,</a>  I will reiterate my statement from last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=773.01s">This</a>  matter presented itself when the Medford City Council at a meeting where it established its priorities for the term said that a priority for this council was to retain independent legal counsel for the Medford City Council, to get a lawyer for the council, an assistant city solicitor to represent the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=792.021s">Now,</a>  I believe by statute, <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=795.204s">the</a>  city solicitor is required to represent both the council and the administration impartially. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=800.866s">When</a>  KP Law was before us and Jonathan Silverstein was before us, he posed the question and the question was, if in fact you're retained by the city of Medford, who do you work for? <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=815.19s">Do</a>  you work for the Medford city council, the city of Medford or the city administration? <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=818.991s">And</a>  his answer was, I work for the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=821.934s">So</a>  here we are, the council asking for independent legal counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=826.157s">We</a>  have a letter from the mayor, a communication from the mayor that says, it was agreed. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=830.92s">It</a>  was agreed that request for council attendance or advice will be submitted through the president. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=837.004s">It</a>  wasn't agreed. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=837.684s">The</a>  council president at the time is sitting right here and he's saying it wasn't agreed. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=841.653s">On</a>  face value, this paper is untruthful, because it was not agreed. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=847.538s">It</a>  was not agreed. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=848.738s">Now,</a>  here we are, and this issue first came up, and it first came up in July, June, June. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=853.942s">It</a>  first came up in June of 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=857.105s">And</a>  I find it curious that this paper never found its way to the council agenda, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=861.648s">Never</a>  found its way to the council agenda until Councilor Marks and Councilor Falco were gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=869.046s">The</a>  administration had plenty of time to bring this paper to the table and to negotiate with the then-council president terms that would be satisfactory to the council that set those priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=877.991s">And</a>  instead what they did, shockingly, was sat on their hands for three months and waited for the weather to change, and then brought the paper forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=886.736s">And</a>  I think that's shameful. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=888.336s">I</a>  think it's shameful. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=890.106s">So</a>  here we are in no further or better of a position than we were back in June when we cut this item out of the budget because the council was not satisfied with the services that we were receiving. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=904.137s">But</a>  the paper's back on the table and we've not moved one inch closer to a positive resolve. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=910.962s">Councilor</a>  Collins makes a point. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=912.303s">She</a>  says, there might be a disruption in services. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=916.684s">You're</a>  gonna hear that a lot, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=918.845s">You're</a>  gonna hear that a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=919.825s">You</a>  have to pass this tonight, or Rome's gonna burn. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=922.605s">We</a>  want it now, we need it now. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=924.166s">If</a>  not, Medford's gonna fall apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=927.547s">It's</a>  a sell, that's all it is, is a sell. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=929.547s">Medford's</a>  not gonna fall apart if they don't have these contracted legal services in this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=934.448s">This</a>  is an increase to the budget, another increase to the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=938.009s">Week</a>  two of the new term, <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=940.802s">Week</a>  two, we've already seen this year's fiscal budget increased twice. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=945.603s">In</a>  two weeks, two proposals to increase the fiscal year budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=949.564s">$191</a>  million, $191 million isn't enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=954.045s">More,</a>  spend more with no plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=957.666s">Piecemeal,</a>  week by week, let's come over here in dribs and drabs and see how much we can get out of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=963.408s">It's</a>  not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=965.088s">It's</a>  not right, it's not proper. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=966.929s">The</a>  council voted to set a list of priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=968.75s">One</a>  of the list of priorities was to be able to retain legal counsel to advise it in matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=974.353s">Because</a>  we haven't received that advice in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=978.495s">And</a>  we've seen what great progress we can make when we have the tools in the toolbox. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=982.978s">We've</a>  seen what great progress we can make when we have Mike Wabrowski sitting there running meetings for us that take on the first comprehensive zoning reform that the city's seen in a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=993.31s">That's</a>  not from the court of office. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=995.151s">That's</a>  from the council chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=996.351s">That's</a>  where this is coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=997.331s">That's</a>  where this work product coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=999.172s">Give</a>  us the tools to succeed and we'll succeed. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1001.933s">This</a>  negotiation is not negotiation. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1005.114s">This</a>  paper is untruthful on its face. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1007.494s">There</a>  was never an agreement made. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1009.055s">There</a>  was never an agreement brought back to this council and voted on by this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1012.456s">The</a>  council set a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1013.936s">They</a>  said the priority was gonna be to have legal counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1016.077s">We</a>  cut this item out of the budget because we didn't have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1018.858s">There</a>  was no negotiation, there was no settlement to the issue at hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1022.341s">The</a>  council is once again, get him pushed aside and get him bamboozled. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1026.344s">For</a>  that reason, that reason alone, I will not be supporting this paper and I support Councilor Scott Cowie's motion to table it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1032.169s">If</a>  in fact we're going to have a constructive dialogue, let's put everybody in the room together. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1036.333s">Let's</a>  talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1037.634s">All</a>  right, the mayor thinks she has the keys to the car now because she has two new councilors over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1041.846s">that</a>  don't have the institutional knowledge or the level of frustration that some of us share from the lack of responses that we receive from our office when we're trying to move the city forward together. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1052.052s">And</a>  for those reasons, I will not be

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1069.214s">for</a>  the funds that we allocated to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1072.496s">Lawsuits</a>  and everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1077.339s">I</a>  wanna know where the money we spent last year went to. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1081.862s">We're</a>  fighting lawsuit after lawsuit on zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1085.605s">We</a>  lost, I don't know how much we spent to lose the zoning case on Boston Avenue, which we knew we were gonna lose. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1092.809s">We're</a>  fighting a 40B that was supposed to start this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1095.811s">It's</a>  not happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1096.812s">We're</a>  gonna fight that, we're gonna lose that too. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1098.863s">I</a>  mean, are we just running, is KP Law just running up the bill on us? <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1103.666s">I</a>  mean, what kind of advice are they giving us when we're losing lawsuits? <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1111.189s">I,</a>  again, this isn't what I agreed to. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1114.771s">What</a>  I agreed to was that we would have direct contact, not a go between. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1119.714s">And</a>  they could not agree to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1121.355s">So</a>  I can't support this either.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1124.897s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, do you have the amendment? <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1128.617s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello would like a detailed explanation of all the legal services performed by KP law last year.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1138.161s">It</a>  was last year, 2021 calendar year.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1140.102s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1140.802s">These</a>  guys are just giving us bad advice and now we're fighting the case against the city of Everett and they're representing Everett and they're leaving us out in the lurch. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1148.545s">And</a>  you wanna give them more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1151.846s">God,</a>  what is the matter with us?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1155.445s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1156.909s">Any</a>  further discussion from members of the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1159.959s">Councilor</a>  Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1163.723s">I've</a>  shared my reservations about this last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1167.545s">I've</a>  been thinking about it, and I do agree with my fellow councilors that our city needs a better plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1173.907s">Our</a>  city needs, our city council needs its own direct legal counsel to go to. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1180.649s">But</a>  again, I believe that we've been pushing this back and pushing this back. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1186.231s">There's</a>  so much in action in the city.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1190.791s">Mr.</a>  President, Mr. Councilor Caraviello, if you could start.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1193.473s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1195.194s">And</a>  in this case, I will vote to move this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1200.036s">But</a>  again, I would like to express that I have strong reservations about passing a budget this calendar year that doesn't have a direct legal representative for us, for the city council.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1213.984s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1216.106s">Any</a>  comments from members of the council?</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1220.67s">Mr.</a>  President, if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1222.332s">Yes,</a>  President Morell to the chair if Chief of Staff is Aaron could just explain a little how these funds support solicitor Scanlon the work she is doing for the council and past papers and opinions that have been requested, or how it would.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1239.438s">Point</a>  of personal privilege on that, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1242.058s">Point</a>  of personal privilege, Councilor Knights.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1243.559s">I'm</a>  just wondering if when Chief of Staff Nazarian gives her presentation, she can give me an estimate as to when the requested draft ordinance that I put forward back in 2020 with KP Law would be forthcoming relative to establishing a $15 minimum wage for all city and school department employees while she's giving her presentation to the answer.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1263.782s">Councilor</a>  Nazarian, if you could answer Councilor Morales' question and Councilor Knights.</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1269.925s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1272.11s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President, for the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1273.653s">I</a>  want to make sure I'm answering the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1280.936s">this</a>  this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1282.678s">The</a>  city has a tremendous amount of legal service needs this work, and I think I might have said this at the last meeting where this was this matter was discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1292.026s">But</a>  you know it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1293.327s">There's</a>  various different topics and disciplines in which the city solicitor is being supported by KP law to ensure that we have the discipline <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1308.996s">specific</a>  counsel who covers matters relating to contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1313.138s">There</a>  is specific counsel for matters relating to, you know, additional counsel for matters that relate to additional work. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1322.761s">There</a>  was counsel that was consulted with regard to election-specific questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1327.903s">So</a>  we speak with multiple different counsels who have various expertise, niche-specific expertise in their own disciplines, <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1336.554s">like</a>  you would expect to find in industry with regard to attorneys, you wouldn't necessarily be able to go to only a general counsel and get discipline specific expert advice. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1349.204s">And</a>  so that's where this relationship, this agreement with KP Law to provide services to the city on both a retainer basis and on a billing per hour basis as far as <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1366.325s">I</a>  apologize, Vice President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1370.087s">One</a>  second, Nina. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1372.449s">With</a>  KP Law. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1376.391s">Where</a>  is that? <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1378.953s">Could</a>  you repeat that? <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1381.554s">We</a>  originally agreed for KP Law to have a budget of $5,000 a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1386.917s">Where</a>  is that now? <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1389.759s">$81,000</a>  is well above the $5,000 we agreed upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1392.3s">So</a>  I'll be going back. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1395.043s">All</a>  they're doing is running up the bill on us.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1397.725s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1399.066s">The</a>  floor is yours, Chief of Staff Nazarian.</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1401.488s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1401.848s">So,</a>  I mean, I'm happy to answer any specific questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1405.131s">I</a>  hope, President Morell, that that answered at least your question. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1409.974s">If</a>  there is further question on that, I'm happy to answer it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1412.376s">And</a>  if Councilor Caraviello, if that was a question that you'd like me to answer, I'm happy to do that too.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1420.982s">Yes,</a>  please.</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1423.963s">you,</a>  Mr. Vice President, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1426.964s">The</a>  present retainer is actually $6800 per month, um, based on the level of work and based on the agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1436.465s">That</a>  is what is presently the going rate for the amount of work that we're putting before K P law. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1443.127s">I</a>  can tell you without a doubt in my mind that that retainer is being very well used. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1448.928s">Of</a>  course, there are other, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1451.577s">that</a>  are outside those billing retainer hours with regard to litigation, but I can tell you there is not a single month that we do not maximize that $6,800 from the standpoint of general counsel, from the point of labor counsel and from the standpoint of contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1467.712s">Those</a>  are all under the retainer and there are other categories that fall under that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1473.257s">And</a>  we're gonna be utilizing their services with all of the categories in which that are part of the retainer.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1481.048s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Chief of Staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1482.068s">Councilor</a>  and I did have a question as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1485.31s">We</a>  had requested that KP Law help draft an ordinance for a $15 city minimum wage in 2020.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1490.371s">It</a>  was 21 months ago, maybe 20 months ago we made the request.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1493.433s">In</a>  a year, yeah, in 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1496.214s">Do</a>  you happen to have any specific information as to if KP Law plans to present a draft ordinance to the council?</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1503.56s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Vice President for bringing that question back up. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1506.702s">My</a>  apologies, Councilor Knight, for not responding to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1512.625s">It</a>  fell off my radar for a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1514.627s">I</a>  don't have the answer to that question, but I definitely would be happy to look into it and follow up with the whole council.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1520.31s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Chief of Staff.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1523.452s">If</a>  I may, Mr. President?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1524.453s">Yes,</a>  Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1525.553s">I</a>  find it very interesting that, you know, KP Law has been given such control of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1534.386s">model</a>  that we're adopting really provides the city with lack of control direction and retention. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1540.468s">And</a>  it also really puts us in a position where we're becoming overreliant on the outsourcing legal services here in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1548.711s">You</a>  know, we'll sit here and we'll talk about all the niche laws <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1551.675s">with</a>  a niche law that we can have expertise on. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1554.837s">I</a>  mean, ultimately, we have people from the administration going to sick people's houses and checking up on them as part of a labor dispute, we have union busting going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1561.502s">All</a>  right, we have labor charges being filed against the city left and right. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1564.985s">Okay,</a>  we're in with there's over 20 labor charges filed against the city right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1568.909s">over</a>  20 labor charges. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1570.669s">So</a>  I'm not too sure what type of advice we're getting, but it doesn't sound like good advice to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1574.931s">When</a>  I hear that the chief of staff is going to sick people's houses on a Friday delivering them lettuce, I don't know what kind of advice we're getting, but it doesn't sound like good advice to me.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1589.574s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1591.475s">Any</a>  further discussion?</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1596.927s">from</a>  the chair uh oh sorry councillor collins sorry i was a late breaking hand raised yeah um i just wanted to to also note that i really appreciate the discussion around this and to my fellow councillors i hope that my willingness to approve quickly i would never want for that to come across as indifference to the frustration that's been built up over the years and i've <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1619.632s">want</a>  to acknowledge and respect the fact that there's been back and forth on this issue for years that I wasn't behind the rail for, and I want to know that that's heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1628.279s">And</a>  I'm glad that Councilor Tseng earlier brought up the need to advocate for a fiscal year 2023 budget in which these concerns are really taken seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1638.787s">So</a>  I think I'd like to <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1641.869s">motion</a>  to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1642.79s">But,</a>  you know, again, want to reiterate, um, you know, I have a concern that this could ripple out into a interruption in service for the residents of this city that's behind my position tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1653.175s">But,</a>  you know, I'm hoping that as a council we can advocate for independent legal counsel for going forward is obviously that's very important.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1662.58s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1663.86s">It's</a>  a motion from Councilor Collins to approve, seconded by</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1669.903s">Second,</a>  Mr. President, if I could as well.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1672.944s">Sure,</a>  President Morell.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1675.105s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1676.006s">Yeah,</a>  I just want to note that like my fellow Councilors, this is not, this is less than ideal. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1681.088s">As</a>  I said last week, my desired outcome of the, you know, my desired setup of this would be having that assistant city solicitor position that has existed for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1691.272s">This</a>  is not my ideal situation, but my vote for this is a vote to support solicitor Scanlon in the office where it's, <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1699.457s">Again,</a>  not my desire. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1700.537s">It</a>  seems like it's rather bare bones. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1702.758s">This</a>  is a vote for right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1704.318s">I</a>  absolutely have the same concerns as my fellow Councilors, and I do not see myself voting for something like this again in the next fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1713.961s">But</a>  this is something that I just see as a need for right now, but not something I want to see continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1720.303s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1722.445s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell, if I may, from the chair, and I'm trying to avoid doing this tonight, as I, again, read up on my Robert's rules, but I think we have a disagreement on process. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1732.893s">I</a>  do not think we have a disagreement on substance. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1735.655s">I'm</a>  hopeful a collaborative and good faith approach can get the result that we all share, the desired result that we all share. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1743.781s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1745.203s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Collins, to approve as amended, seconded by? <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1751.127s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1753.586s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1825.991s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much, as indicated in my lengthy soliloquy on the previous matter relative to my concerns relative to the spending in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1837.401s">I've</a>  raised this issue in the past, and I put it on the agenda again. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1841.005s">Before</a>  Anishal Natalie was moved on to greener pastures, she would appear before us quarterly <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1849.507s">and</a>  provide us with a presentation on our fiscal health and wellness. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1852.11s">And</a>  part of that would include, Mr. President, discussion about our forecast of revenues versus our actual returns, where we are in the budget right now in the process of spending, what our debt service obligations are, so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1867.704s">We</a>  now have had this great influx of money coming in from the federal government. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1872.349s">We</a>  have ARPA money. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1873.67s">We're</a>  looking at what about $49 million I believe was the figure to be spent over the next three years we've already spent about a quarter of that with no federal funds manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1881.835s">So</a>  my concerns really focused on being sure that we act as fiscal stewards, and that we are aware of what direction we're going and how much spending <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1891.36s">we're</a>  committing to, and what position we're going to be putting ourselves into the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1894.983s">And</a>  I'd like to see our chief financial officer, as well as the necessary consultants that seem to be providing a great deal of services to this community, to be here as well, to answer the questions that we need to address, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1905.19s">But</a>  this is something that we did last term. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1907.172s">It</a>  was something that proved to be very successful, and I'd ask my council colleagues to support it.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1911.715s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1913.436s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1915.858s">Is</a>  there any discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1921.465s">If</a>  I may, from the chair, just add an amendment that we put this resolution under reports due in addition to approving it tonight, put it under reports due so that we can invite the chief financial officer down to a future meeting to give us that presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1940.717s">Well,</a>  the title. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1943.618s">Right</a>  now, there's an interim person in that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1946.28s">I</a>  believe the position has been posted for a permanent position.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1950.163s">Ultimately,</a>  Mr. President, I don't think that the city council's ability to be updated and be filled in as to what's going on in this community should be subject to the personnel disasters that are going on across the hall.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1961.292s">Oh,</a>  certainly not. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1962.173s">I</a>  would invite whoever's in that position right now.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1963.854s">I</a>  don't care who the CFO is or auditor is, but that's the person that should be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1967.957s">And</a>  if they don't have the answers for us, then that's going to be very indicating as to what direction this community is going in financially.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1973.288s">That</a>  is the intent of my amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1979.252s">Let's</a>  just keep it on because it's quarterly. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1981.494s">So</a>  we can keep it on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1985.276s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1990.18s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1995.844s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, as amended by myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2000.807s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2034.565s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2035.847s">As</a>  you're well aware, we pass a budget every year and that budget says we're gonna spend money on this and we're gonna spend money on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2041.952s">But</a>  then we sit here and we say, how much money did we give KP Law? <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2047.036s">The</a>  Warren articles are what will tell us that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2048.577s">The</a>  Warren articles are what we spend our bills on every month. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2050.998s">In</a>  other forms of government, sometimes the Warren articles have to be approved by the city council on a monthly basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2055.479s">That's</a>  not the case here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2057.6s">However,</a>  the Warren articles are very telling as to what direction this community is going in, where our money is being spent, whether or not we're meeting the obligations, the goals that we've established through the budget process. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2067.104s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I'd ask that this practice be reinstated. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2070.805s">Again,</a>  this was an item that, <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2072.826s">And</a>  Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin was providing us with previously before her departure from this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2078.151s">And</a>  it showed us quite a bit of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2080.893s">I</a>  do believe when we reviewed this information last time, we found that there were a number of lawsuits that were settled that were over the sum of $2,500, which require council approval that were never brought before the council, for example. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2091.943s">So</a>  there's a lot of spending practices that are going on here that I think we need to take a closer look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2095.787s">And</a>  the Warren articles will be very telling to us as to what direction <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2099.84s">our</a>  communities going in and whether or not we're adopting the generally accepted accounting principles that are so recommended in municipal government. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2107.363s">So</a>  with that being said, I asked my council colleagues to support this resolution.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2193.525s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2195.246s">Under</a>  the Burke administration, the city of Medford a very successful senior work off program and the senior work off program provided senior citizens in this community with the opportunity to volunteer their services here for the city in exchange for an abatement on their property taxes up to I believe it was 1000 or $1500 per person. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2213.291s">This</a>  program, I believe has been discontinued. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2216.622s">in</a>  light of probably COVID and a number of other factors. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2220.306s">But</a>  this is a benefit that with the adoption of a local option, we can extend to veterans here in this community as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2226.031s">And</a>  I think that that would be a good thing, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2227.653s">We</a>  have a number of veterans in this community, over 2,000 veterans reside in the city of Metro. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2231.798s">And</a>  I think if we can take the appropriate steps to adopt a provision like this and then request that the administration implement, I will be able to provide some property tax relief to a number of people that served our country. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2242.25s">So</a>  I'm asking if the council support this measure and I'm hoping that we can move post haste to have a meeting with the solicitor and the assessor to determine what steps we need to take to appropriately implement. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2254.823s">Thank</a>  you Councilor Knight, Councilor Stroud.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2256.484s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2256.825s">Thank</a>  you Councilor Knight for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2259.768s">I</a>  think that with the senior abatement program, it works so well for so many residents that need that support. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2267.236s">And</a>  I know that Councilor Caraviello works so closely with veteran services and realizing how many talented <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2276.174s">veterans</a>  we have in this community and the ability for them to come out and use their expertise to maybe work with our kids at the vocational school or work with the recreation department, programming, or even here at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2290.222s">So</a>  especially what we're seeing in today's society, I think it would be important that we give back to the people that gave us so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2299.648s">And</a>  I would second the motion, Councilor Ioannoni. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2302.229s">Thank</a>  you for bringing that forward.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2335.298s">I</a>  want to thank Councilor Knight for bringing this forward and thank both Councilors Knight and Scarpelli for what they've said so far tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2343.846s">Again,</a>  this I think would be a great program for veterans in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2350.172s">I</a>  also think that this is about giving back to those who served us. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2353.856s">I</a>  think this is also about <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2356.398s">justice</a>  and equity as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2358.359s">We</a>  know for a fact that those who serve our country are disproportionately working class, disproportionately people of color, disproportionately marginalized. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2369.506s">We</a>  know that when they come back from service, that we as a society don't always treat them the way that they should be treated. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2376.85s">Our</a>  government isn't always there to support them, to give them the support they deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2385.155s">And</a>  so this, I think, is a step in the right direction, and I will be voting in favor of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2390.979s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2392.88s">Nice</a>  for the veterans to get the support in City Hall.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2467.733s">Well,</a>  the paper before us would be the disposition of the paper would be asking them to appeal before us and give us a presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2472.996s">So</a>  we dispose of the paper, send it to the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2475.097s">We're</a>  ready to come back to you with the answer.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2478.879s">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2479.259s">Yeah,</a>  I just wanted to make sure this doesn't get lost in the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2482.381s">Okay,</a>  thank you for that clarification.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2607.518s">Mr.</a>  President, I do believe that that area would be referred to as a sleepy hollow. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2613.36s">And</a>  if it's my understanding, there is a maintenance agreement between the DCR and the city of Medford, where the city of Medford actually agrees to maintain and control the cleanliness of that area, if I'm not mistaken.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2629.204s">I</a>  see the DOT down there cleaning it, but they've been down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2633.205s">But</a>  right now, no one's cleaning it again.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2636.037s">are,</a>  just for my clarity, this is a, are you referring to the park across the footbridge behind Medford Square?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2649.243s">Is</a>  that when you say sleeping on the condon shell?</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2868.095s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2870.674s">Thank</a>  you for reading that whole thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2874.037s">So</a>  this resolution is not intended to point fingers or rehash an incident that we already know about. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2882.366s">This</a>  resolution is intended to follow up on the work that the administration has begun in the wake of the offensive menorah display. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2888.392s">at</a>  the holiday extravaganza in December. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2890.835s">We're</a>  aware that the administration has taken some good first steps and to move forward from that event, including starting the conversation with representatives from Temple Shalom da Marion Ryan, the anti defamation league and city hall staff and beginning to plan some trainings. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2907.534s">My</a>  intent is to affirm that the goal here should be to create a culture of inclusion and broad community engagement within City Hall, and with the planning of city events specifically, so much so that offensive incidents like the menorah display are just not possible to happen anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2924.271s">aspire</a>  for this administration to have such strong relationships across our many faith and cultural and ethnic communities and be so and get so good at inviting people into City Hall and to our event planning processes that this kind of unfortunate yet human error wouldn't ever make it into the final version of a city event. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2944.155s">So</a>  I'm happy to see that the work to move forward has begun and we want to confirm that this work is really necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2950.076s">not</a>  just because of the menorah display and to heal ties with the Jewish community members who were alienated by it, but rather that, you know, to say that it's necessary in any case to make this city hall a place where people from any background can feel represented and feel belonging because that's what a city hall really needs to be to be successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2968.888s">So</a>  finally, you know, we want to request that update from the administration on what the next steps are to continue improving inclusion and engagement with the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2977.133s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2978.877s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2979.637s">Councilor</a>  Tseng? <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2982.259s">It's</a>  difficult to follow up such an eloquent explanation of this resolution, but I just wanted to give a little bit of anecdotal experience about growing up here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2992.864s">As</a>  someone who came from a different faith and cultural background, it wasn't always easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2998.747s">And</a>  you know, you would never, you <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3001.928s">You</a>  wouldn't always have accurate depictions of your culture or the culture in which you grew up in. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3007.934s">But</a>  I am happy that our city has been making progress on this front over the last decade, especially. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3016.783s">And</a>  I just wanted to acknowledge that there's still a lot of work to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3022.369s">And</a>  our, you know, communities of faith or cultural communities, ethnic communities here are counting on us to be the leaders in making sure that we get this right and that we build a city that's as inclusive as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3036.99s">There's</a>  a lot that we haven't talked about as a city that I think merits discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3042.832s">Antisemitism</a>  is one of those topics. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3045.013s">We've</a>  had recorded incidents of antisemitism in this city, of antisemitic attacks, violence, depictions. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3058.078s">Very</a>  unfortunately, we've had swastikas carved into fence posts and public spaces here. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3065.02s">and</a>  it's time for us to step up and address all these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3068.202s">And</a>  so I'm, you know, we're, Councilor Collins and I are here today to make sure that, to reaffirm the work that our city is doing so far and to make sure that we are moving forward and we're challenging ourselves to move as inclusive a direction as possible.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3084.692s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3088.474s">Seconded</a>  on the motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3092.356s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3094.119s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3175.214s">22-031</a>  offered by Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3178.235s">Be</a>  it resolved that the city council ask the city administration for an update on COVID-19 response plans for city senior living facilities given the recent surge in COVID-19 cases. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3188.197s">Councilor</a>  Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3188.977s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3190.517s">Last</a>  week we hit in our state record highs in terms of COVID-19 cases. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3195.218s">And</a>  even though we know that the circumstances are different from where we were two years ago, there are still community concerns about <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3203.08s">on</a>  the spread of COVID-19 and the risk that this poses to our senior citizens living in senior living facilities here. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3209.605s">And</a>  so, especially given previous records, both in the city and nationally. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3214.228s">And</a>  so I propose this resolution to make sure that we are all informed as a community as to what our city is doing to make sure that our senior citizens are as safe as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3226.295s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3228.176s">If</a>  my fellow council would like, would amend that to also include the nursing homes that we have in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3235.357s">My</a>  dad happens to be one of them and I just got an update from one of them this afternoon saying how many people are sick in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3241.779s">So</a>  if you wouldn't mind amending that to bring in the nursing homes that are in the city of Medford also.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3251.973s">Yes,</a>  Mr. President, I too would like to amend this further, just by asking that the administration respond to the Council in writing and then post it on the city website as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3261.5s">So</a>  this information can be readily available to citizens in the community have concerns about their loved ones and such facilities.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3267.704s">That</a>  was to respond in writing and post on the city website. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3272.367s">Any</a>  further discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3278.384s">just</a>  for my sake, I definitely support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3283.546s">And</a>  I noted today that governor Baker extended a booster mandate to people working in facilities like these. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3291.208s">So</a>  that is one thing I heard today, but definitely a lot of concerns from a lot of folks around this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3297.209s">On</a>  the motion of councilor Tseng, seconded by councilor Scarpelli, as amended by councilor Caraviello and councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3304.792s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3309.22s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3359.888s">Councilor</a>  Tsai. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3360.908s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3362.228s">We</a>  know that Omicron is a more transmissible variant. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3365.489s">We're</a>  seeing the results of that in our case count today. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3369.091s">We</a>  also today, the CDC officials have confirmed that they are looking at updating mask guidance to recommend N95 and KN95 masks be worn. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3383.987s">And</a>  experts at top medical institutions have raised <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3387.651s">this</a>  issue that we should be we should be distributing more KN95 masks to everyone and making sure that we are wearing these more protective masks. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3398.875s">You</a>  know it's given given all of these all the recent recommendations and given the possible change in guidance from the CDC. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3407.978s">It's</a>  going to be harder and harder to secure masks. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3410.299s">I</a>  mean, it's already difficult for many people to figure out what's a counterfeit mask and what's not to secure those orders online. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3417.422s">And</a>  I'm proposing this because I think we need to keep our workers safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3423.464s">I</a>  think we need to keep us all safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3426.165s">I</a>  think we need to mitigate the financial burden that mask buying can pose to a lot of working class families in this town. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3433.847s">And</a>  I also believe that if we are asking people to mask as a city, we should give them the means to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3440.81s">And</a>  again, we need to address the problem of counterfeits, which is why I added the line about the National Institute for Occupational Safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3453.472s">We,</a>  I left out N95 masks because currently CDC guidance does not recommend that we stockpile N95 masks because they are, they should be treated as priority for medical staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3470.504s">I</a>  just wanted to be transparent about that point and explain why this resolution focuses on KN95 masks.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3480.512s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3481.412s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3482.865s">Thank</a>  you and thank you councillor saying for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3486.108s">I</a>  think that this is a great thing to see the city lead on. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3490.072s">I</a>  too have heard the recent guidance about how it's true, and 95, but you know more to the point KN 95 are more protective and surgical masks they're certainly more protective and cloth masks. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3501.463s">And</a>  I think at the point that you know we're trying to the administration is trying to do all it can to keep our residents, safe, correct masking is a huge part of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3512.63s">And</a>  we have to evolve our guidance with the evolving nature of the virus with the infection levels in our community and I think <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3519.595s">Councilor</a>  Tseng brings up a great point that it's increasingly difficult to find masks. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3524.718s">And</a>  I think people are feeling kind of out in the wind when it comes to being able to source masks that will protect them, that will help them not keep the virus, not bring the virus home to their families, you know, kind of regardless of vaccination status, because that's where we're at in this pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3539.728s">So</a>  I think if there is a, if there's a way for this administration to source masks so that we can better protect the people in our community, <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3548.593s">that</a>  are most in need of them, people who can't work from home, people who work for the municipality, work for our schools, people who are disproportionately likely to be in infection prone scenarios. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3560.919s">We</a>  need to be doing all that we can to help protect those community members. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3565.622s">So</a>  thank you, Councilor Tseng, and I'll be strong in support of this today.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3574.346s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3575.086s">I</a>  want to thank Councilor Tseng for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3576.887s">I</a>  actually raised <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3578.587s">similar</a>  concerns about access and costs way back when, with the original mask mandates being put into place. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3585.492s">And</a>  I thank him for leaning on the administration to see what they can do here. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3590.095s">As</a>  with many things, unfortunately, it seems like the city and municipalities are the last line of defense with the least amount of funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3596.499s">So</a>  I would hope that our state leaders and our leaders at the federal level are looking into this as well, as they have vastly more funding than the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3605.383s">I</a>  appreciate the assay administration and I really hope this is something we can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3608.926s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3611.428s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3612.649s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3613.65s">I'm</a>  just gonna put one more piece of information out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3618.834s">There's</a>  an incredibly helpful chart published in the Wall Street Journal last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3624.933s">If</a>  you have one person who is infected and one person who's not infected, standing about six feet apart, if neither of them are wearing any sort of mask, it will take about 15 minutes to transmit a infectious dose. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3636.697s">If</a>  they're both wearing cloth masks, it would take about 27 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3640.199s">If</a>  they're both wearing surgical masks, it would take about one hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3642.96s">If</a>  they're both wearing a non-fit tested KN95 or N95, it would take 25 hours to transmit. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3650.262s">So</a>  it's a significant increase <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3652.463s">in</a>  protection if, you know, with a little bit of a change to the mask that you're wearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3656.724s">If</a>  you're using a tightly sealed fitted N95, if both people are using that, you would have 2,500 hours of protection. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3664.045s">So</a>  it's a really significant difference between the different types of masking. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3671.207s">So</a>  that was just really a helpful way for me to learn about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3678.277s">Seeing</a>  no further discussion on the motion of Councilor Tseng seconded by Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3685.179s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3704.222s">Yes,</a>  seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3706.127s">The</a>  motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3706.869s">22-035</a>  offered by Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3711.204s">Whereas</a>  Mayor Loco Kern and the Medford Board of Health have declared racism to be a public health crisis, and whereas the Center for Disease Control cites more COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, deaths, and mental health challenges in areas where racial and ethnic minority groups live, learn, work, play, and worship, explained through discrimination, limited healthcare access and use, occupational, educational income and wealth gaps, and crowded housing conditions, <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3736.046s">be</a>  it resolved that the Medford City Council ask for an update from the city administration on its plans to achieve an equitable response to the current COVID-19 surge, and be it further resolved that the Medford City Council ask the city administration to increase free COVID-19 testing, vaccination opportunities, contact tracing, and public information efforts in the neighborhoods and communities that are disproportionately lower income and or non-white. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3757.153s">Councilor</a>  Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3758.566s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3759.967s">Where</a>  our statements give much of the reason for this resolution, we know that when we look at the effect of COVID-19, when we look at the spread, the severity, when we look at numbers such as vaccination rates, we see that working class communities and non-white communities have been suffering disproportionately from the COVID-19 pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3784.548s">Medford</a>  is no exception to this rule. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3787.089s">There</a>  is unfortunately a vaccination gap in town for the BIPOC community. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3795.152s">We</a>  also know that there's more that we can do as a city to address these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3802.794s">The</a>  city council and the city government labeled racism as a public health crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3808.476s">I</a>  think this is following up on that <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3812.618s">action</a>  back last year or back then, I believe that we need to be consistent in our actions and that by uplifting the working class, by uplifting BIPOC folks, by uplifting marginalized folks, we are uplifting us, all of us, and keeping all of us safer, keeping every single one of us safer. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3839.103s">I</a>  that's why I'm putting this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3841.245s">I'm</a>  aware that the city has taken a few measures on this front. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3846.549s">We,</a>  the city administration's let me know that they have, they've increased some public public health information campaigns in <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3859.272s">neighborhoods</a>  of color, they have been working with faith leaders and community leaders to make sure that we are vaccinating as many people as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3866.635s">But</a>  I think many of us have the question of what what comes next, how are we responding to the surge? <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3872.717s">How</a>  can we? <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3873.557s">How</a>  can we help as a city council? <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3875.198s">How</a>  can we help as a community? <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3877.138s">And</a>  how can we do better? <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3878.839s">And</a>  how can we evaluate what we're doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3881.42s">So</a>  this is why I'm putting this forward today.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3885.962s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3888.401s">Any</a>  discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3889.522s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3891.164s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3892.125s">And,</a>  you know, I think some of the last points that you raised really speak to the heart of this, which is, you know, what being able to track and assess what are we doing, what's left to do, how can we help more? <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3903.236s">And</a>  I also want to echo a comment that President Morell made on the previous paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3908.074s">regarding</a>  how truly tragic it is that so much of the pandemic response has been left to local governments. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3915.678s">And</a>  I certainly hope that we can take these lessons forward as a nation for our next, God forbid, public health emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3923.581s">But</a>  as the case is that a lot of responsibility has fallen on the shoulders of our local boards of health nationwide, we still need to be saying, how can we bring up the baseline? <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3933.206s">How</a>  can we make sure that we're achieving an equitable response <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3935.687s">how</a>  much more can we be doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3937.408s">So</a>  I'd love to see this administration look into keeping up the vaccination clinics, continuing to reevaluate our mask mandates, ability to share and distribute medical resources, looking into PCR testing for our community, the things that are very, very hard for residents to find on their own. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3956.076s">So</a>  thank you again for bringing this up, Councilor Tseng.</p>
