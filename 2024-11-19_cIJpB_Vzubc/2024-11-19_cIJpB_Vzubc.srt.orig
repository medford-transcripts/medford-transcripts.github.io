[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Mahoon, as I drive by there many times during the week, I would just hope that you do a better job with the rubbish than the other, than your previous owner did, because they say the trash is out there all the time and not very attractive for the neighbor, so that's all I ask you is,

106
00:04:57,095 --> 00:04:59,157
[SPEAKER_06]: is to get that trash situation under control there.

107

00:05:57,682 --> 00:06:03,746
[SPEAKER_07]: 22-022 communication from the mayor to the Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council, City Hall.

141
00:06:05,857 --> 00:06:09,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Medford, Massachusetts, 02155, regarding budget amendment.

142
00:06:09,258 --> 00:06:15,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Dear Mr. President and councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that the city council approves the following amendment to the fiscal year 2022 budget.

143
00:06:15,401 --> 00:06:17,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Line item 0101515032, contract legal services, FY22 budgeted amount, $26,600.

144
00:06:26,445 --> 00:06:42,446
[SPEAKER_07]: proposed amended about $81,600 following the passage of the fiscal year 2022 budget by the council I engaged in conversations with Council President Carabino, City Solicitor Kim Scanlon, and KP Law to develop a process where the council can avail themselves of KP Law's services and counsel as needed.

145
00:06:43,207 --> 00:06:55,436
[SPEAKER_07]: In those discussions, it was agreed that requests for council attendance or advice will be submitted by the council through the council president, who will coordinate with the city solicitor, who will schedule meetings with KP Law to get whatever legal resources are needed to address the council's requests.

146
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,418
[SPEAKER_07]: Respectfully submitted, Brianna Lumgo-Kern, Mayor.

147
00:06:58,878 --> 00:07:00,459
[SPEAKER_07]: This was on the agenda last week.

148
00:07:00,619 --> 00:07:03,561
[SPEAKER_07]: It was postponed for one week on rule 20.

149
00:07:04,942 --> 00:07:06,824
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw Councilor Kerrio and then Councilor Scarbelli.

150
00:07:06,944 --> 00:07:27,241
[SPEAKER_06]: And Mr. President, I'll just reaffirm for people who didn't see this last week, in my discussions with the Mayor last year, for KP Law to represent the Council, it was the Council's request that we have a direct contact and not a go-between, and I think that was the holdup between on the $26,000, and it hasn't changed since then.

151
00:07:31,758 --> 00:07:32,579
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli.

152
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:35,061
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we could, I have the same question.

153
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:54,998
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that if we can table this and call for a Committee of the Whole meeting before our meeting next week, a regular meeting, and ask the city solicitor and maybe the chief of staff, just to clarify, I think that this is important for the fact that what we asked for is a representation.

154
00:07:55,358 --> 00:07:58,381
[SPEAKER_09]: So we, at the time when this all occurred, didn't look like

155
00:08:00,492 --> 00:08:19,125
[SPEAKER_09]: uneducated buffoons and dog chasing his tail when we had legal issues, not to battle against our own administration, but just to guide us on legal terms and legal movements as we had some concerns.

156
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:28,511
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I don't wanna see this, if this could be rectified in a committee of the whole meeting where,

157
00:08:30,455 --> 00:08:34,957
[SPEAKER_09]: we can iron this out and make sure this is defined a little bit better.

158
00:08:35,017 --> 00:08:39,379
[SPEAKER_09]: So it does appease both parties and we could have someone that represents the council.

159
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:43,681
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that would be amazing.

160
00:08:43,701 --> 00:08:47,663
[SPEAKER_09]: I just don't want it to fail this evening and then sit again for a few months.

161
00:08:47,703 --> 00:08:56,547
[SPEAKER_09]: So my motion would be to table for committee of the whole meeting next week with the chief of staff in the city solicitor.

162
00:08:59,025 --> 00:09:02,888
[SPEAKER_07]: excuse me, we do have a committee of the whole already scheduled for next Tuesday at 5.30.

163
00:09:04,249 --> 00:09:05,369
[SPEAKER_07]: Kim Scanlon will be there.

164
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,171
[SPEAKER_07]: It is regarding the elections commission.

165
00:09:09,212 --> 00:09:12,354
[SPEAKER_07]: So we will have her, we could discuss the process.

166
00:09:13,295 --> 00:09:14,976
[SPEAKER_07]: She is scheduled to be before us on the day.

167
00:09:15,036 --> 00:09:19,740
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, well, I think it wouldn't be, I think it would just be a defining evening for this.

168
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,483
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think this would take too long, but if we can add that.

169
00:09:24,943 --> 00:09:25,243
[SPEAKER_11]: Gotcha.

170
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:32,081
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a motion by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Ntuk-Table.

171
00:09:32,461 --> 00:09:33,242
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Collins.

172
00:09:34,342 --> 00:09:34,763
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

173
00:09:36,123 --> 00:09:50,472
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we vote, I'd just like to voice, you know, one thing that I heard from Chief of Staff Nazari in our discussion on this proposal last week was a concern that failure to quickly pass this budget amendment would

174
00:09:51,272 --> 00:09:56,276
[SPEAKER_00]: leave the administration short on legal counsel in the short term or maybe for the rest of the fiscal year.

175
00:09:56,897 --> 00:10:11,329
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a concern of mine because I could see a lot of circumstances where having, you know, any department in the city having insufficient access to legal counsel on a variety of matters could really hold us up and, you know, any numerous important issues that we're trying to work on.

176
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:14,111
[SPEAKER_00]: over the next five, six months.

177
00:10:14,171 --> 00:10:17,152
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a concern of mine.

178
00:10:17,172 --> 00:10:21,733
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I'm leaning towards trying to pass this expediently, because I totally agree.

179
00:10:21,753 --> 00:10:26,455
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to see us lobby for independent counsel for this council going forward.

180
00:10:26,495 --> 00:10:35,058
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do have pretty strong reservations about, you know, delaying passage of the amendment and ripple effects that that could have for the administration in the short term.

181
00:10:35,998 --> 00:10:37,399
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can point information with that.

182
00:10:38,517 --> 00:10:42,581
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, the clerk has reminded me that a motion to table is not debatable.

183
00:10:42,821 --> 00:10:44,903
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm still getting up on my council rules.

184
00:10:44,983 --> 00:10:48,166
[SPEAKER_07]: So we will have to vote on that before we have further debate.

185
00:10:48,806 --> 00:10:51,609
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Mr. Clerk, on the motion to table, if you could please call the roll.

186
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:53,991
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Kerrio?

187
00:10:54,171 --> 00:10:54,411
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

188
00:10:55,132 --> 00:10:55,732
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Collins?

189
00:10:56,253 --> 00:10:56,393
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

190
00:10:56,433 --> 00:10:58,115
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Nye?

191
00:10:58,155 --> 00:10:58,435
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

192
00:10:58,455 --> 00:10:59,696
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Stroud?

193
00:10:59,836 --> 00:11:00,156
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

194
00:11:00,877 --> 00:11:01,377
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Sanders?

195
00:11:01,678 --> 00:11:02,058
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

196
00:11:02,999 --> 00:11:03,619
[SPEAKER_10]: President Morrell?

197
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:04,280
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

198
00:11:07,204 --> 00:11:07,905
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Ferris.

199
00:11:08,065 --> 00:11:10,426
[SPEAKER_07]: No, three in the affirmative, four in the negative.

200
00:11:10,747 --> 00:11:11,928
[SPEAKER_07]: The motion is not tabled.

201
00:11:12,768 --> 00:11:15,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Snider.

202
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:32,223
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's disheartening for my fellow councilor, who's new to the process, who just shared some insight, those fears that we're leaving the city without legal representation for one week, when we wanna make sure, until you're sitting in this council,

203
00:11:32,743 --> 00:11:58,509
[SPEAKER_09]: and I'm shocked with my veteran counselors that sat here and watched our dogs chase the tail and how embarrassing it was for us to sit here for two meetings because we didn't have representation and how hard we fought during the budget meeting to get a line item that represented what we asked for and then to come back and something disingenuine to say that we're asking for, we're getting money, but it can't be used for what we're asking for.

204
00:11:58,729 --> 00:12:00,790
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just giving the city more money

205
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:08,713
[SPEAKER_09]: the negative ramifications we've seen with the assistance from KP law and different city functions.

206
00:12:08,733 --> 00:12:10,374
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's a little deciding to me.

207
00:12:10,914 --> 00:12:13,976
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand everybody has a vote and we've spoken.

208
00:12:14,036 --> 00:12:25,282
[SPEAKER_09]: So I will not vote for it because I think we needed a week to get better understanding with the chief of staff and the legal representation from the city to guide us when we have questions.

209
00:12:25,982 --> 00:12:28,263
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so if that, it is what it is.

210
00:12:28,283 --> 00:12:28,823
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you.

211
00:12:30,184 --> 00:12:31,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

212
00:12:32,898 --> 00:12:33,639
[SPEAKER_07]: Any counselors?

213
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:34,661
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President?

214
00:12:34,681 --> 00:12:36,784
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, President Morrell.

215
00:12:37,485 --> 00:12:38,486
[SPEAKER_03]: I do see Chief of Staff, Ms.

216
00:12:38,547 --> 00:12:40,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Aaron, she is on the call right now.

217
00:12:40,309 --> 00:12:42,392
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if counselors have questions at the moment.

218
00:12:43,173 --> 00:12:45,136
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to point that out.

219
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:47,139
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

220
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,021
[SPEAKER_08]: Counselor Knight.

221
00:12:48,507 --> 00:12:49,788
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

222
00:12:49,988 --> 00:12:52,229
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, I will reiterate my statement from last week.

223
00:12:53,010 --> 00:13:11,140
[SPEAKER_08]: This matter presented itself when the Medford City Council at a meeting where it established its priorities for the term said that a priority for this council was to retain independent legal counsel for the Medford City Council, to get a lawyer for the council, an assistant city solicitor to represent the council.

224
00:13:12,021 --> 00:13:14,102
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I believe by statute,

225
00:13:15,204 --> 00:13:19,765
[SPEAKER_08]: the city solicitor is required to represent both the council and the administration impartially.

226
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:34,570
[SPEAKER_08]: When KP Law was before us and Jonathan Silverstein was before us, he posed the question and the question was, if in fact you're retained by the city of Medford, who do you work for?

227
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:38,391
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you work for the Medford city council, the city of Medford or the city administration?

228
00:13:38,991 --> 00:13:40,952
[SPEAKER_08]: And his answer was, I work for the administration.

229
00:13:41,934 --> 00:13:45,136
[SPEAKER_08]: So here we are, the council asking for independent legal counsel.

230
00:13:46,157 --> 00:13:49,899
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a letter from the mayor, a communication from the mayor that says, it was agreed.

231
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:56,863
[SPEAKER_08]: It was agreed that request for council attendance or advice will be submitted through the president.

232
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:57,624
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't agreed.

233
00:13:57,684 --> 00:14:00,566
[SPEAKER_08]: The council president at the time is sitting right here and he's saying it wasn't agreed.

234
00:14:01,653 --> 00:14:06,877
[SPEAKER_08]: On face value, this paper is untruthful, because it was not agreed.

235
00:14:07,538 --> 00:14:08,218
[SPEAKER_08]: It was not agreed.

236
00:14:08,738 --> 00:14:13,762
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, here we are, and this issue first came up, and it first came up in July, June, June.

237
00:14:13,942 --> 00:14:15,584
[SPEAKER_08]: It first came up in June of 2021.

238
00:14:17,105 --> 00:14:21,068
[SPEAKER_08]: And I find it curious that this paper never found its way to the council agenda, Mr. President.

239
00:14:21,648 --> 00:14:26,272
[SPEAKER_08]: Never found its way to the council agenda until Councilor Marks and Councilor Falco were gone.

240
00:14:29,046 --> 00:14:37,310
[SPEAKER_08]: The administration had plenty of time to bring this paper to the table and to negotiate with the then-council president terms that would be satisfactory to the council that set those priorities.

241
00:14:37,991 --> 00:14:46,215
[SPEAKER_08]: And instead what they did, shockingly, was sat on their hands for three months and waited for the weather to change, and then brought the paper forward.

242
00:14:46,736 --> 00:14:47,596
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's shameful.

243
00:14:48,336 --> 00:14:49,057
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's shameful.

244
00:14:50,106 --> 00:15:01,395
[SPEAKER_08]: So here we are in no further or better of a position than we were back in June when we cut this item out of the budget because the council was not satisfied with the services that we were receiving.

245
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:09,861
[SPEAKER_08]: But the paper's back on the table and we've not moved one inch closer to a positive resolve.

246
00:15:10,962 --> 00:15:12,223
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Collins makes a point.

247
00:15:12,303 --> 00:15:15,586
[SPEAKER_08]: She says, there might be a disruption in services.

248
00:15:16,684 --> 00:15:18,564
[SPEAKER_08]: You're gonna hear that a lot, Councilor Collins.

249
00:15:18,845 --> 00:15:19,785
[SPEAKER_08]: You're gonna hear that a lot.

250
00:15:19,825 --> 00:15:22,025
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to pass this tonight, or Rome's gonna burn.

251
00:15:22,605 --> 00:15:24,146
[SPEAKER_08]: We want it now, we need it now.

252
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:25,846
[SPEAKER_08]: If not, Medford's gonna fall apart.

253
00:15:27,547 --> 00:15:29,307
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a sell, that's all it is, is a sell.

254
00:15:29,547 --> 00:15:33,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Medford's not gonna fall apart if they don't have these contracted legal services in this budget.

255
00:15:34,448 --> 00:15:37,369
[SPEAKER_08]: This is an increase to the budget, another increase to the budget.

256
00:15:38,009 --> 00:15:39,890
[SPEAKER_08]: Week two of the new term,

257
00:15:40,802 --> 00:15:45,243
[SPEAKER_08]: Week two, we've already seen this year's fiscal budget increased twice.

258
00:15:45,603 --> 00:15:49,544
[SPEAKER_08]: In two weeks, two proposals to increase the fiscal year budget.

259
00:15:49,564 --> 00:15:53,265
[SPEAKER_08]: $191 million, $191 million isn't enough.

260
00:15:54,045 --> 00:15:56,606
[SPEAKER_08]: More, spend more with no plan.

261
00:15:57,666 --> 00:16:02,427
[SPEAKER_08]: Piecemeal, week by week, let's come over here in dribs and drabs and see how much we can get out of the council.

262
00:16:03,408 --> 00:16:03,928
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not right.

263
00:16:05,088 --> 00:16:06,369
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not right, it's not proper.

264
00:16:06,929 --> 00:16:08,730
[SPEAKER_08]: The council voted to set a list of priorities.

265
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:13,213
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the list of priorities was to be able to retain legal counsel to advise it in matters.

266
00:16:14,353 --> 00:16:17,515
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we haven't received that advice in the past.

267
00:16:18,495 --> 00:16:22,438
[SPEAKER_08]: And we've seen what great progress we can make when we have the tools in the toolbox.

268
00:16:22,978 --> 00:16:31,843
[SPEAKER_08]: We've seen what great progress we can make when we have Mike Wabrowski sitting there running meetings for us that take on the first comprehensive zoning reform that the city's seen in a number of years.

269
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:34,590
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not from the court of office.

270
00:16:35,151 --> 00:16:36,311
[SPEAKER_08]: That's from the council chambers.

271
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,311
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where this is coming from.

272
00:16:37,331 --> 00:16:38,832
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where this work product coming from.

273
00:16:39,172 --> 00:16:41,273
[SPEAKER_08]: Give us the tools to succeed and we'll succeed.

274
00:16:41,933 --> 00:16:44,614
[SPEAKER_08]: This negotiation is not negotiation.

275
00:16:45,114 --> 00:16:47,234
[SPEAKER_08]: This paper is untruthful on its face.

276
00:16:47,494 --> 00:16:48,695
[SPEAKER_08]: There was never an agreement made.

277
00:16:49,055 --> 00:16:52,016
[SPEAKER_08]: There was never an agreement brought back to this council and voted on by this council.

278
00:16:52,456 --> 00:16:53,556
[SPEAKER_08]: The council set a priority.

279
00:16:53,936 --> 00:16:55,817
[SPEAKER_08]: They said the priority was gonna be to have legal counsel.

280
00:16:56,077 --> 00:16:58,238
[SPEAKER_08]: We cut this item out of the budget because we didn't have it.

281
00:16:58,858 --> 00:17:02,001
[SPEAKER_08]: There was no negotiation, there was no settlement to the issue at hand.

282
00:17:02,341 --> 00:17:05,664
[SPEAKER_08]: The council is once again, get him pushed aside and get him bamboozled.

283
00:17:06,344 --> 00:17:11,669
[SPEAKER_08]: For that reason, that reason alone, I will not be supporting this paper and I support Councilor Scott Cowie's motion to table it.

284
00:17:12,169 --> 00:17:15,692
[SPEAKER_08]: If in fact we're going to have a constructive dialogue, let's put everybody in the room together.

285
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:17,153
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's talk about it.

286
00:17:17,634 --> 00:17:21,036
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, the mayor thinks she has the keys to the car now because she has two new councilors over here.

287
00:17:21,846 --> 00:17:29,570
[SPEAKER_08]: that don't have the institutional knowledge or the level of frustration that some of us share from the lack of responses that we receive from our office when we're trying to move the city forward together.

288
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:34,233
[SPEAKER_08]: And for those reasons, I will not be supporting this paper this evening.

289
00:17:35,174 --> 00:17:35,894
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councillor Knight.

290
00:17:36,615 --> 00:17:37,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Councillor Kerrio.

291
00:17:49,214 --> 00:17:52,096
[SPEAKER_06]: for the funds that we allocated to them.

292
00:17:52,496 --> 00:17:54,778
[SPEAKER_06]: Lawsuits and everything.

293
00:17:57,339 --> 00:18:01,842
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanna know where the money we spent last year went to.

294
00:18:01,862 --> 00:18:05,384
[SPEAKER_06]: We're fighting lawsuit after lawsuit on zoning.

295
00:18:05,605 --> 00:18:12,469
[SPEAKER_06]: We lost, I don't know how much we spent to lose the zoning case on Boston Avenue, which we knew we were gonna lose.

296
00:18:12,809 --> 00:18:15,411
[SPEAKER_06]: We're fighting a 40B that was supposed to start this week.

297
00:18:15,811 --> 00:18:16,512
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not happening.

298
00:18:16,812 --> 00:18:18,273
[SPEAKER_06]: We're gonna fight that, we're gonna lose that too.

299
00:18:18,863 --> 00:18:23,065
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, are we just running, is KP Law just running up the bill on us?

300
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:28,588
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, what kind of advice are they giving us when we're losing lawsuits?

301
00:18:31,189 --> 00:18:34,751
[SPEAKER_06]: I, again, this isn't what I agreed to.

302
00:18:34,771 --> 00:18:39,034
[SPEAKER_06]: What I agreed to was that we would have direct contact, not a go between.

303
00:18:39,714 --> 00:18:41,255
[SPEAKER_06]: And they could not agree to that.

304
00:18:41,355 --> 00:18:44,036
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can't support this either.

305
00:18:44,897 --> 00:18:45,977
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Clerk, do you have the amendment?

306
00:18:48,617 --> 00:18:57,761
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Kerrio would like a detailed explanation of all the legal services performed by KP law last year.

307
00:18:58,161 --> 00:19:00,062
[SPEAKER_07]: It was last year, 2021 calendar year.

308
00:19:00,082 --> 00:19:00,062
2021.

309
00:19:00,102 --> 00:19:00,502
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

310
00:19:00,802 --> 00:19:08,485
[SPEAKER_06]: These guys are just giving us bad advice and now we're fighting the case against the city of Everett and they're representing Everett and they're leaving us out in the lurch.

311
00:19:08,545 --> 00:19:11,026
[SPEAKER_06]: And you wanna give them more money.

312
00:19:11,846 --> 00:19:13,547
[SPEAKER_06]: God, what is the matter with us?

313
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:16,629
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Carviello.

314
00:19:16,909 --> 00:19:19,357
[SPEAKER_07]: Any further discussion from members of the council?

315
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:20,460
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Sang.

316
00:19:23,723 --> 00:19:25,884
[SPEAKER_05]: I've shared my reservations about this last week.

317
00:19:27,545 --> 00:19:33,667
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been thinking about it, and I do agree with my fellow councilors that our city needs a better plan.

318
00:19:33,907 --> 00:19:40,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Our city needs, our city council needs its own direct legal counsel to go to.

319
00:19:40,649 --> 00:19:45,390
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, I believe that we've been pushing this back and pushing this back.

320
00:19:46,231 --> 00:19:48,351
[SPEAKER_05]: There's so much in action in the city.

321
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:53,393
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, Mr. Councilor Kerrio, if you could start.

322
00:19:53,473 --> 00:19:54,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

323
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:59,536
[SPEAKER_05]: And in this case, I will vote to move this forward.

324
00:20:00,036 --> 00:20:12,764
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, I would like to express that I have strong reservations about passing a budget this calendar year that doesn't have a direct legal representative for us, for the city council.

325
00:20:13,984 --> 00:20:14,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Sang.

326
00:20:16,106 --> 00:20:18,367
[SPEAKER_07]: Any comments from members of the council?

327
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:21,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, if I could.

328
00:20:22,332 --> 00:20:37,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, President Morrell to the chair if Chief of Staff is Aaron could just explain a little how these funds support solicitor Scanlon the work she is doing for the council and past papers and opinions that have been requested, or how it would.

329
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:41,918
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of personal privilege on that, Mr. President?

330
00:20:42,058 --> 00:20:43,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of personal privilege, Councilor Nights.

331
00:20:43,559 --> 00:21:02,542
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just wondering if when Chief of Staff Nazarian gives her presentation, she can give me an estimate as to when the requested draft ordinance that I put forward back in 2020 with KP Law would be forthcoming relative to establishing a $15 minimum wage for all city and school department employees while she's giving her presentation to the answer.

332
00:21:03,782 --> 00:21:08,483
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Nazarian, if you could answer Councilor Morales' question and Councilor Nights.

333
00:21:09,925 --> 00:21:11,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

334
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Madam President, for the question.

335
00:21:13,653 --> 00:21:18,965
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to make sure I'm answering the question.

336
00:21:20,936 --> 00:21:21,897
[SPEAKER_02]: this this work.

337
00:21:22,678 --> 00:21:31,525
[SPEAKER_02]: The city has a tremendous amount of legal service needs this work, and I think I might have said this at the last meeting where this was this matter was discussed.

338
00:21:32,026 --> 00:21:33,067
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know it.

339
00:21:33,327 --> 00:21:43,235
[SPEAKER_02]: There's various different topics and disciplines in which the city solicitor is being supported by KP law to ensure that we have the discipline

340
00:21:48,996 --> 00:21:52,637
[SPEAKER_02]: specific counsel who covers matters relating to contracts.

341
00:21:53,138 --> 00:22:02,661
[SPEAKER_02]: There is specific counsel for matters relating to, you know, additional counsel for matters that relate to additional work.

342
00:22:02,761 --> 00:22:07,443
[SPEAKER_02]: There was counsel that was consulted with regard to election-specific questions.

343
00:22:07,903 --> 00:22:15,986
[SPEAKER_02]: So we speak with multiple different counsels who have various expertise, niche-specific expertise in their own disciplines,

344
00:22:16,554 --> 00:22:28,744
[SPEAKER_02]: like you would expect to find in industry with regard to attorneys, you wouldn't necessarily be able to go to only a general counsel and get discipline specific expert advice.

345
00:22:29,204 --> 00:22:45,397
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's where this relationship, this agreement with KP Law to provide services to the city on both a retainer basis and on a billing per hour basis as far as

346
00:22:46,325 --> 00:22:49,907
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize, Vice President.

347
00:22:50,087 --> 00:22:50,968
[SPEAKER_06]: One second, Nina.

348
00:22:52,449 --> 00:22:54,950
[SPEAKER_06]: With KP Law.

349
00:22:56,391 --> 00:22:56,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Where is that?

350
00:22:58,953 --> 00:23:00,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Could you repeat that?

351
00:23:01,554 --> 00:23:05,917
[SPEAKER_06]: We originally agreed for KP Law to have a budget of $5,000 a month.

352
00:23:06,917 --> 00:23:09,359
[SPEAKER_06]: Where is that now?

353
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:11,720
[SPEAKER_06]: $81,000 is well above the $5,000 we agreed upon.

354
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,301
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll be going back.

355
00:23:15,043 --> 00:23:16,684
[SPEAKER_06]: All they're doing is running up the bill on us.

356
00:23:17,725 --> 00:23:18,826
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

357
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:20,527
[SPEAKER_07]: The floor is yours, Chief of Staff Nazarian.

358
00:23:21,488 --> 00:23:21,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

359
00:23:21,848 --> 00:23:25,050
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, I'm happy to answer any specific questions.

360
00:23:25,131 --> 00:23:29,914
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope, President Morrell, that that answered at least your question.

361
00:23:29,974 --> 00:23:32,336
[SPEAKER_02]: If there is further question on that, I'm happy to answer it.

362
00:23:32,376 --> 00:23:39,681
[SPEAKER_02]: And if Councilor Caraviello, if that was a question that you'd like me to answer, I'm happy to do that too.

363
00:23:40,982 --> 00:23:41,383
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, please.

364
00:23:43,963 --> 00:23:46,404
[SPEAKER_02]: you, Mr Vice President, Councilor Carviello.

365
00:23:46,964 --> 00:23:56,345
[SPEAKER_02]: The present retainer is actually $6800 per month, um, based on the level of work and based on the agreement.

366
00:23:56,465 --> 00:24:03,107
[SPEAKER_02]: That is what is presently the going rate for the amount of work that we're putting before K P law.

367
00:24:03,127 --> 00:24:08,388
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell you without a doubt in my mind that that retainer is being very well used.

368
00:24:08,928 --> 00:24:10,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, there are other, um,

369
00:24:11,577 --> 00:24:26,951
[SPEAKER_02]: that are outside those billing retainer hours with regard to litigation, but I can tell you there is not a single month that we do not maximize that $6,800 from the standpoint of general counsel, from the point of labor counsel and from the standpoint of contracts.

370
00:24:27,712 --> 00:24:33,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are all under the retainer and there are other categories that fall under that as well.

371
00:24:33,257 --> 00:24:38,261
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're gonna be utilizing their services with all of the categories in which that are part of the retainer.

372
00:24:41,048 --> 00:24:42,028
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Madam Chief of Staff.

373
00:24:42,068 --> 00:24:43,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor and I did have a question as well.

374
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:50,211
[SPEAKER_07]: We had requested that KP Law help draft an ordinance for a $15 city minimum wage in 2020.

375
00:24:50,371 --> 00:24:53,192
[SPEAKER_08]: It was 21 months ago, maybe 20 months ago we made the request.

376
00:24:53,433 --> 00:24:54,853
[SPEAKER_07]: In a year, yeah, in 2020.

377
00:24:56,214 --> 00:25:02,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you happen to have any specific information as to if KP Law plans to present a draft ordinance to the council?

378
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President for bringing that question back up.

379
00:25:06,702 --> 00:25:11,125
[SPEAKER_02]: My apologies, Councillor Knight, for not responding to that.

380
00:25:12,625 --> 00:25:14,066
[SPEAKER_02]: It fell off my radar for a second.

381
00:25:14,627 --> 00:25:19,069
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have the answer to that question, but I definitely would be happy to look into it and follow up with the whole council.

382
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,231
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Madam Chief of Staff.

383
00:25:23,452 --> 00:25:24,132
[SPEAKER_08]: If I may, Mr. President?

384
00:25:24,453 --> 00:25:25,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Councillor Knight.

385
00:25:25,553 --> 00:25:32,057
[SPEAKER_08]: I find it very interesting that, you know, KP Law has been given such control of this community.

386
00:25:34,386 --> 00:25:39,368
[SPEAKER_08]: model that we're adopting really provides the city with lack of control direction and retention.

387
00:25:40,468 --> 00:25:47,491
[SPEAKER_08]: And it also really puts us in a position where we're becoming overreliant on the outsourcing legal services here in this community.

388
00:25:48,711 --> 00:25:50,992
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we'll sit here and we'll talk about all the niche laws

389
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:54,777
[SPEAKER_08]: with a niche law that we can have expertise on.

390
00:25:54,837 --> 00:26:01,062
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, ultimately, we have people from the administration going to sick people's houses and checking up on them as part of a labor dispute, we have union busting going on.

391
00:26:01,502 --> 00:26:04,304
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, we have labor charges being filed against the city left and right.

392
00:26:04,985 --> 00:26:07,987
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, we're in with there's over 20 labor charges filed against the city right now.

393
00:26:08,909 --> 00:26:10,169
[SPEAKER_08]: over 20 labor charges.

394
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:14,891
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm not too sure what type of advice we're getting, but it doesn't sound like good advice to me.

395
00:26:14,931 --> 00:26:22,192
[SPEAKER_08]: When I hear that the chief of staff is going to sick people's houses on a Friday delivering them lettuce, I don't know what kind of advice we're getting, but it doesn't sound like good advice to me.

396
00:26:29,574 --> 00:26:30,254
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

397
00:26:31,475 --> 00:26:32,375
[SPEAKER_07]: Any further discussion?

398
00:26:36,927 --> 00:26:58,692
[SPEAKER_00]: from the chair uh oh sorry councillor collins sorry i was a late breaking hand raised yeah um i just wanted to to also note that i really appreciate the discussion around this and to my fellow councillors i hope that my willingness to approve quickly i would never want for that to come across as indifference to the frustration that's been built up over the years and i've

399
00:26:59,632 --> 00:27:08,219
[SPEAKER_00]: want to acknowledge and respect the fact that there's been back and forth on this issue for years that I wasn't behind the rail for, and I want to know that that's heard.

400
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:18,086
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm glad that Councilor Tsang earlier brought up the need to advocate for a fiscal year 2023 budget in which these concerns are really taken seriously.

401
00:27:18,787 --> 00:27:21,249
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I'd like to

402
00:27:21,869 --> 00:27:22,689
[SPEAKER_00]: motion to approve.

403
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:33,095
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, again, want to reiterate, um, you know, I have a concern that this could ripple out into a interruption in service for the residents of this city that's behind my position tonight.

404
00:27:33,175 --> 00:27:40,639
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I'm hoping that as a council we can advocate for independent legal counsel for going forward is obviously that's very important.

405
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,620
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

406
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:46,682
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a motion from Councilor Collins to approve, seconded by

407
00:27:49,903 --> 00:27:51,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Second, Mr. President, if I could as well.

408
00:27:52,944 --> 00:27:53,985
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, President Morrell.

409
00:27:55,105 --> 00:27:55,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

410
00:27:56,006 --> 00:28:00,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I just want to note that like my fellow counselors, this is not, this is less than ideal.

411
00:28:01,088 --> 00:28:10,151
[SPEAKER_03]: As I said last week, my desired outcome of the, you know, my desired setup of this would be having that assistant city solicitor position that has existed for a long time.

412
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:18,635
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not my ideal situation, but my vote for this is a vote to support solicitor Scanlon in the office where it's,

413
00:28:19,457 --> 00:28:20,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, not my desire.

414
00:28:20,537 --> 00:28:22,218
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like it's rather bare bones.

415
00:28:22,758 --> 00:28:24,298
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a vote for right now.

416
00:28:24,318 --> 00:28:33,221
[SPEAKER_03]: I absolutely have the same concerns as my fellow counselors, and I do not see myself voting for something like this again in the next fiscal year.

417
00:28:33,961 --> 00:28:39,983
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is something that I just see as a need for right now, but not something I want to see continue.

418
00:28:40,303 --> 00:28:40,723
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.

419
00:28:42,445 --> 00:28:52,533
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, President Morrell, if I may, from the chair, and I'm trying to avoid doing this tonight, as I, again, read up on my Robert's rules, but I think we have a disagreement on process.

420
00:28:52,893 --> 00:28:54,855
[SPEAKER_07]: I do not think we have a disagreement on substance.

421
00:28:55,655 --> 00:29:02,761
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm hopeful a collaborative and good faith approach can get the result that we all share, the desired result that we all share.

422
00:29:03,781 --> 00:29:04,142
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

423
00:29:05,203 --> 00:29:08,885
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Councilor Collins, to approve as amended, seconded by?

424
00:29:11,127 --> 00:29:12,248
[SPEAKER_07]: Seconded by Councilor Sang.

425
00:29:13,586 --> 00:29:14,647
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

426
00:29:18,369 --> 00:29:19,029
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Kerrio?

427
00:29:19,269 --> 00:29:19,469
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

428
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:21,310
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Collins?

429
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:21,830
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

430
00:29:22,891 --> 00:29:23,411
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight?

431
00:29:23,811 --> 00:29:24,032
No.

00:29:25,612 --> 00:29:26,053

434
00:29:27,213 --> 00:29:27,714
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Sang?

435
00:29:27,734 --> 00:29:28,074
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_07]: Four in the affirmative, three in the negative, the motion passes.

441
00:29:40,089 --> 00:29:44,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to revert to the regular order of business by Councillor Knight, seconded by Councillor Scarpelli.

442
00:29:44,711 --> 00:29:45,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

443
00:29:49,252 --> 00:29:49,853
[SPEAKER_10]: Councillor Kerrio?

444
00:29:50,593 --> 00:29:50,773
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

445
00:29:51,573 --> 00:29:52,154
[SPEAKER_10]: Councillor Collins?

446
00:29:52,614 --> 00:29:52,814
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

447
00:29:53,214 --> 00:29:53,714
[SPEAKER_10]: Councillor Knight?

448
00:29:53,934 --> 00:29:54,134
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

449
00:29:54,374 --> 00:29:54,995
[SPEAKER_10]: Councillor Scarpelli?

450
00:29:55,015 --> 00:29:55,115
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

451

[SPEAKER_10]: Councillor Singh?

452
00:29:56,635 --> 00:29:56,775
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

453
00:29:57,395 --> 00:29:58,016
[SPEAKER_10]: President Morrell?

454
00:30:01,117 --> 00:30:01,277
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

455
00:30:03,283 --> 00:30:04,004
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice president bears.

456
00:30:04,064 --> 00:30:25,507
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, 70 affirmative zero and the negative the motion passes motions orders and resolutions 22 dash 026 offered by counselor night be it so resolved that the city chief financial officer slash auditor and necessary consultants provide the council with a quarterly presentation on the city's financial health, including but not limited to forecasted versus actual revenues and ARPA spending counselor night.

457
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:36,521
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, thank you very much, as indicated in my lengthy soliloquy on the previous matter relative to my concerns relative to the spending in this community.

458
00:30:37,401 --> 00:30:40,124
[SPEAKER_08]: I've raised this issue in the past, and I put it on the agenda again.

459
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:49,052
[SPEAKER_08]: Before Anishal Natalie was moved on to greener pastures, she would appear before us quarterly

460
00:30:49,507 --> 00:30:51,949
[SPEAKER_08]: and provide us with a presentation on our fiscal health and wellness.

461
00:30:52,110 --> 00:31:07,204
[SPEAKER_08]: And part of that would include, Mr. President, discussion about our forecast of revenues versus our actual returns, where we are in the budget right now in the process of spending, what our debt service obligations are, so on and so forth.

462
00:31:07,704 --> 00:31:12,289
[SPEAKER_08]: We now have had this great influx of money coming in from the federal government.

463
00:31:12,349 --> 00:31:13,270
[SPEAKER_08]: We have ARPA money.

464
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:21,294
[SPEAKER_08]: We're looking at what about $49 million I believe was the figure to be spent over the next three years we've already spent about a quarter of that with no federal funds manager.

465
00:31:21,835 --> 00:31:30,760
[SPEAKER_08]: So my concerns really focused on being sure that we act as fiscal stewards, and that we are aware of what direction we're going and how much spending

466
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,523
[SPEAKER_08]: we're committing to, and what position we're going to be putting ourselves into the future.

467
00:31:34,983 --> 00:31:45,170
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'd like to see our chief financial officer, as well as the necessary consultants that seem to be providing a great deal of services to this community, to be here as well, to answer the questions that we need to address, Mr. President.

468
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:46,812
[SPEAKER_08]: But this is something that we did last term.

469
00:31:47,172 --> 00:31:50,134
[SPEAKER_08]: It was something that proved to be very successful, and I'd ask my council colleagues to support it.

470
00:31:51,715 --> 00:31:52,596
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

471
00:31:53,436 --> 00:31:55,698
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

472
00:31:55,858 --> 00:31:56,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there any discussion?

473
00:32:01,465 --> 00:32:18,776
[SPEAKER_07]: If I may, from the chair, just add an amendment that we put this resolution under reports due in addition to approving it tonight, put it under reports due so that we can invite the chief financial officer down to a future meeting to give us that presentation.

474
00:32:20,717 --> 00:32:22,218
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the title.

475
00:32:23,618 --> 00:32:26,080
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now, there's an interim person in that position.

476
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:29,963
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe the position has been posted for a permanent position.

477
00:32:30,163 --> 00:32:40,531
[SPEAKER_08]: Ultimately, Mr. President, I don't think that the city council's ability to be updated and be filled in as to what's going on in this community should be subject to the personnel disasters that are going on across the hall.

478
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:41,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, certainly not.

479
00:32:42,173 --> 00:32:43,834
[SPEAKER_07]: I would invite whoever's in that position right now.

480
00:32:43,854 --> 00:32:47,937
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't care who the CFO is or auditor is, but that's the person that should be here.

481
00:32:47,957 --> 00:32:52,741
[SPEAKER_08]: And if they don't have the answers for us, then that's going to be very indicating as to what direction this community is going in financially.

482
00:32:53,288 --> 00:32:54,649
[SPEAKER_07]: That is the intent of my amendment.

483
00:32:59,252 --> 00:33:01,254
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's just keep it on because it's quarterly.

484
00:33:01,494 --> 00:33:03,595
[SPEAKER_07]: So we can keep it on it.

485
00:33:05,276 --> 00:33:05,496
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

486
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:10,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Any further discussion?

487
00:33:15,844 --> 00:33:19,946
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Councillor Knight, seconded by Councillor Scarpelli, as amended by myself.

488
00:33:20,807 --> 00:33:21,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

489
00:33:23,262 --> 00:33:23,902
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Kerrio.

490
00:33:25,443 --> 00:33:26,084
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Collins.

491
00:33:26,324 --> 00:33:26,524
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

492
00:33:27,765 --> 00:33:28,245
[SPEAKER_10]: Also night.

493
00:33:28,325 --> 00:33:28,605
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

494
00:33:29,126 --> 00:33:29,846
[SPEAKER_10]: Also Scott Kelly.

495
00:33:29,986 --> 00:33:30,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

496
00:33:30,386 --> 00:33:31,307
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor saying yes.

497
00:33:32,007 --> 00:33:32,688
[SPEAKER_10]: President Morrell.

498
00:33:33,028 --> 00:33:33,228
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

499
00:33:34,629 --> 00:33:35,330
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President bears.

500
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:48,598
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes 70 affirmative zero the negative the motion passes 22 027 offered by Councilor night, be it so resolved that the city chief financial officer auditor provide the city council with a copy of the war articles on a monthly basis and

501
00:33:49,121 --> 00:33:53,104
[SPEAKER_07]: be it further resolved that the item be added to the reports due section of the council agenda.

502
00:33:53,545 --> 00:33:54,125
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

503
00:33:54,565 --> 00:33:55,827
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

504
00:33:55,847 --> 00:34:01,471
[SPEAKER_08]: As you're well aware, we pass a budget every year and that budget says we're gonna spend money on this and we're gonna spend money on that.

505
00:34:01,952 --> 00:34:04,834
[SPEAKER_08]: But then we sit here and we say, how much money did we give KP Law?

506
00:34:07,036 --> 00:34:08,417
[SPEAKER_08]: The Warren articles are what will tell us that.

507
00:34:08,577 --> 00:34:10,597
[SPEAKER_08]: The Warren articles are what we spend our bills on every month.

508
00:34:10,998 --> 00:34:15,439
[SPEAKER_08]: In other forms of government, sometimes the Warren articles have to be approved by the city council on a monthly basis.

509
00:34:15,479 --> 00:34:16,940
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not the case here in the city of Medford.

510
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:26,524
[SPEAKER_08]: However, the Warren articles are very telling as to what direction this community is going in, where our money is being spent, whether or not we're meeting the obligations, the goals that we've established through the budget process.

511
00:34:27,104 --> 00:34:30,365
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I'd ask that this practice be reinstated.

512
00:34:30,805 --> 00:34:31,726
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, this was an item that,

513
00:34:32,826 --> 00:34:37,650
[SPEAKER_08]: And Alicia Nunley-Benjamin was providing us with previously before her departure from this community.

514
00:34:38,151 --> 00:34:40,593
[SPEAKER_08]: And it showed us quite a bit of information.

515
00:34:40,893 --> 00:34:51,383
[SPEAKER_08]: I do believe when we reviewed this information last time, we found that there were a number of lawsuits that were settled that were over the sum of $2,500, which require council approval that were never brought before the council, for example.

516
00:34:51,943 --> 00:34:55,346
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's a lot of spending practices that are going on here that I think we need to take a closer look at.

517
00:34:55,787 --> 00:34:58,309
[SPEAKER_08]: And the Warren articles will be very telling to us as to what direction

518
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:07,263
[SPEAKER_08]: our communities going in and whether or not we're adopting the generally accepted accounting principles that are so recommended in municipal government.

519
00:35:07,363 --> 00:35:10,264
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that being said, I asked my council colleagues to support this resolution.

520
00:35:13,004 --> 00:35:13,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Any discussion?

521
00:35:15,205 --> 00:35:15,825
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a second?

522
00:35:16,526 --> 00:35:16,766
Second.

523
00:35:17,526 --> 00:35:20,607
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Carabiello.

524
00:35:22,668 --> 00:35:26,329
[SPEAKER_07]: Seeing no further discussion, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll, or Councilor Sang.

525
00:35:27,249 --> 00:35:27,689
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no.

526
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:28,510
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

527
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:29,450
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

528
00:35:31,293 --> 00:35:31,914
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Kerrio?

529
00:35:32,014 --> 00:35:32,655
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

530
00:35:33,456 --> 00:35:34,037
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Collins?

531
00:35:34,297 --> 00:35:34,478
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

532
00:35:35,379 --> 00:35:35,880
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Nikes?

533
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:36,320
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

534
00:35:37,061 --> 00:35:37,762
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Scarpelli?

535
00:35:37,883 --> 00:35:38,243
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

536
00:35:38,704 --> 00:35:39,205
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Sanchez?

537
00:35:39,385 --> 00:35:39,605
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

538
00:35:40,246 --> 00:35:40,927
[SPEAKER_10]: President Morrell?

539
00:35:41,268 --> 00:35:41,508
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

540
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:43,711
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Paris?

541
00:35:43,871 --> 00:35:47,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, 70 affirmative, none in the negative, the motion passes.

542
00:35:48,539 --> 00:35:51,060
[SPEAKER_07]: 22-028 offered by Councilor Knight.

543
00:35:51,520 --> 00:36:03,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas the City of Medford has adopted provisions of Mass General Law, Chapter 59, Section 5K, allowing for the reduction of property tax obligations of persons over age 60 in exchange for volunteer services, also known as the Senior Workoff Program.

544
00:36:04,406 --> 00:36:09,609
[SPEAKER_07]: And whereas the same benefit may be extended to veterans and in certain instances their spouse with the adoption of a local option,

545
00:36:10,129 --> 00:36:25,900
[SPEAKER_07]: being further resolved that the City Solicitor and City Assessor appear before the Council to outline the required process for our Medford City Council to adopt the provisions of Mass General Law, Chapter 59, Section 5N, allowing for the reduction of property tax obligation of veterans in exchange for volunteer services.

546
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:32,164
[SPEAKER_07]: The text of Chapter 59, Section 5K is, for Chapter 59, is below for reference purposes.

547
00:36:32,244 --> 00:36:32,725
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Nay.

548
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:34,725
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

549
00:36:35,246 --> 00:36:52,311
[SPEAKER_08]: Under the Burke administration, the city of Medford a very successful senior work off program and the senior work off program provided senior citizens in this community with the opportunity to volunteer their services here for the city in exchange for an abatement on their property taxes up to I believe it was 1000 or $1500 per person.

550
00:36:53,291 --> 00:36:55,332
[SPEAKER_08]: This program, I believe has been discontinued.

551
00:36:56,622 --> 00:36:59,625
[SPEAKER_08]: in light of probably COVID and a number of other factors.

552
00:37:00,306 --> 00:37:05,210
[SPEAKER_08]: But this is a benefit that with the adoption of a local option, we can extend to veterans here in this community as well.

553
00:37:06,031 --> 00:37:07,613
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that that would be a good thing, Mr. President.

554
00:37:07,653 --> 00:37:10,936
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a number of veterans in this community, over 2,000 veterans reside in the city of Metro.

555
00:37:11,798 --> 00:37:21,789
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think if we can take the appropriate steps to adopt a provision like this and then request that the administration implement, I will be able to provide some property tax relief to a number of people that served our country.

556
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:32,581
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm asking if the council support this measure and I'm hoping that we can move post haste to have a meeting with the solicitor and the assessor to determine what steps we need to take to appropriately implement.

557
00:37:34,823 --> 00:37:36,304
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you Councilor Nye, Councilor Stroud.

558
00:37:36,484 --> 00:37:36,805
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

559
00:37:36,825 --> 00:37:39,147
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you Councilor Nye for bringing this forward.

560
00:37:39,768 --> 00:37:46,596
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that with the senior abatement program, it works so well for so many residents that need that support.

561
00:37:47,236 --> 00:37:55,606
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know that Councilor Carviela works so closely with veteran services and realizing how many talented

562
00:37:56,174 --> 00:38:10,182
[SPEAKER_09]: veterans we have in this community and the ability for them to come out and use their expertise to maybe work with our kids at the vocational school or work with the recreation department, programming, or even here at City Hall.

563
00:38:10,222 --> 00:38:19,288
[SPEAKER_09]: So especially what we're seeing in today's society, I think it would be important that we give back to the people that gave us so much.

564
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:22,189
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would second the motion, Councilor Ioannoni.

565
00:38:22,229 --> 00:38:23,190
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for bringing that forward.

566
00:38:24,726 --> 00:38:28,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Just to clarify, Councilor Knight, is your motion to approve to refer to Committee of the Whole?

567
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:31,972
[SPEAKER_08]: I think if you read the text of it, because it's wicked long, I don't blame you for missing it.

568
00:38:33,934 --> 00:38:37,196
[SPEAKER_08]: The solicitor and the assessor appear before the Council without lining up for upper steps.

569
00:38:37,336 --> 00:38:38,177
[SPEAKER_07]: In a regular session.

570
00:38:38,377 --> 00:38:39,318
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, in a regular session.

571
00:38:39,478 --> 00:38:40,219
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's fine.

572
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:41,120
[SPEAKER_08]: Either way, it's fine with me.

573
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,621
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to do it in regular session.

574
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,863
[SPEAKER_08]: If there's no, doesn't sound like there's going to be much opposition to it.

575
00:38:45,903 --> 00:38:47,945
[SPEAKER_08]: If there's no opposition to it, we can do it in regular session.

576
00:38:48,145 --> 00:38:49,306
[SPEAKER_07]: Certainly no opposition from me.

577
00:38:49,666 --> 00:38:50,267
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

578
00:38:50,547 --> 00:38:52,929
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion, Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

579
00:38:55,298 --> 00:39:02,725
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to thank Councillor Knight for bringing this forward and thank both Councillors Knight and Scarpelli for what they've said so far tonight.

580
00:39:03,846 --> 00:39:09,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, this I think would be a great program for veterans in our city.

581
00:39:10,172 --> 00:39:13,836
[SPEAKER_05]: I also think that this is about giving back to those who served us.

582
00:39:13,856 --> 00:39:15,197
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is also about

583
00:39:16,398 --> 00:39:17,599
[SPEAKER_05]: justice and equity as well.

584
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:29,266
[SPEAKER_05]: We know for a fact that those who serve our country are disproportionately working class, disproportionately people of color, disproportionately marginalized.

585
00:39:29,506 --> 00:39:36,830
[SPEAKER_05]: We know that when they come back from service, that we as a society don't always treat them the way that they should be treated.

586
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:41,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Our government isn't always there to support them, to give them the support they deserve.

587
00:39:45,155 --> 00:39:49,998
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this, I think, is a step in the right direction, and I will be voting in favor of this.

588
00:39:50,979 --> 00:39:52,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Seng.

589
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,161
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice for the veterans to get the support in City Hall.

590
00:39:56,182 --> 00:39:57,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

591
00:39:57,463 --> 00:39:59,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, thank you, Councilor, for bringing this forward.

592
00:40:00,145 --> 00:40:04,087
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the senior program has been a great program for the seniors in our city.

593
00:40:04,667 --> 00:40:10,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Not only helps them with their tax bills, but, you know, it gives them a chance to be productive in the community.

594
00:40:10,251 --> 00:40:13,393
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, they work here, they work at schools, they work at the senior center.

595
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:15,253
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a good thing for them.

596
00:40:15,593 --> 00:40:19,814
[SPEAKER_06]: And now to bring our veterans into this is also a good thing too.

597
00:40:20,354 --> 00:40:26,456
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, these are men and women who served that country and they have skills to give back.

598
00:40:27,256 --> 00:40:34,898
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, again, give them the same opportunity as everyone else gets, you know, some of them aren't working, some of them are retired, but again, they have skills.

599
00:40:35,198 --> 00:40:36,458
[SPEAKER_06]: They want to be involved in the community.

600
00:40:36,858 --> 00:40:39,079
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think we should continue to involve them in the community.

601
00:40:39,539 --> 00:40:41,179
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will support this program tonight.

602
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:42,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Carvillo.

603
00:40:42,981 --> 00:40:43,721
[SPEAKER_07]: President Morrell.

604
00:40:44,562 --> 00:40:45,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

605
00:40:45,383 --> 00:40:47,324
[SPEAKER_03]: And thanks, Councilor Knight, for bringing this forward.

606
00:40:47,344 --> 00:40:51,648
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is a great idea, and I appreciate your research and awareness on this.

607
00:40:51,728 --> 00:41:01,836
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to check procedurally if this is something we want to address in a regular session, would this be something that would be reintroduced or tabled until those representatives can join us?

608
00:41:07,733 --> 00:41:12,976
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the paper before us would be the disposition of the paper would be asking them to appeal before us and give us a presentation.

609
00:41:12,996 --> 00:41:15,077
[SPEAKER_08]: So we dispose of the paper, send it to the administration.

610
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:18,279
[SPEAKER_08]: We're ready to come back to you with the answer.

611
00:41:18,879 --> 00:41:19,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, great.

612
00:41:19,259 --> 00:41:22,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I just wanted to make sure this doesn't get lost in the process.

613
00:41:22,381 --> 00:41:23,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thank you for that clarification.

614
00:41:26,603 --> 00:41:26,804
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

615
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:30,245
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Councillor Knight, seconded by Councillor Scarpelli.

616
00:41:30,286 --> 00:41:31,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there any further discussion?

617
00:41:34,168 --> 00:41:36,409
[SPEAKER_07]: Any discussion from members of the public?

618
00:41:41,179 --> 00:41:42,480
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

619
00:41:45,741 --> 00:41:45,921
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

620
00:41:45,941 --> 00:41:46,081
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

621
00:41:46,121 --> 00:41:46,362
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

622
00:41:46,622 --> 00:41:47,142
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

623
00:41:47,782 --> 00:41:48,082
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

624
00:41:48,162 --> 00:41:48,483
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

625
00:41:48,663 --> 00:41:48,803
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

626
00:41:57,875 --> 00:41:59,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes 70 affirmative, zero in the negative.

627
00:41:59,676 --> 00:42:00,677
[SPEAKER_07]: The motion passes.

628
00:42:00,697 --> 00:42:03,399
[SPEAKER_07]: 22-029 offered by Councilor Carabiello.

629
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:11,925
[SPEAKER_07]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council have the DOT slash DCR clean route 16 from the Meadow Glen Mall to the Condon Shell of all rubbish and debris.

630
00:42:12,106 --> 00:42:12,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Carabiello.

631
00:42:13,947 --> 00:42:14,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

632
00:42:14,487 --> 00:42:16,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, something I bring up a couple of times a year.

633
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:21,353
[SPEAKER_06]: You drive down route 16, as soon as you cross over the bridge,

634
00:42:22,343 --> 00:42:28,866
[SPEAKER_06]: All you look at the side of the road you see rubbish all over the place mattresses things, and it goes like that all the way down to the cotton show.

635
00:42:29,526 --> 00:42:38,530
[SPEAKER_06]: I asked over the summer that they at least trim the trees on me that the bushes and things on on the credit bridge and then none of that ever happens.

636
00:42:39,496 --> 00:42:40,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, disappointed with them.

637
00:42:41,218 --> 00:42:48,865
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, I say, again, you just drive down this filth, filth all on both sides of the road.

638
00:42:48,906 --> 00:42:52,109
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if it's the DOT, DCI, whichever one wants to take responsibility.

639
00:42:52,489 --> 00:42:52,910
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't do it.

640
00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:56,533
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll come down, they'll clean up a little section, and then they stop right there.

641
00:42:56,753 --> 00:42:58,055
[SPEAKER_06]: But it continues all the way down.

642
00:42:59,396 --> 00:43:02,959
[SPEAKER_06]: All on that whole medium ship is crap all over the place, crap on the side of the road.

643
00:43:04,761 --> 00:43:12,227
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say also, amend this to, send this to our state delegation to get them to come out there and clean this.

644
00:43:13,288 --> 00:43:19,214
[SPEAKER_06]: It can be cleaned now, that I say, I mean, the amount of rubbish that sits on the side of the road is an eyesore.

645
00:43:19,714 --> 00:43:24,058
[SPEAKER_06]: It should be cleaned up, and our city deserves better than what we're getting.

646
00:43:27,518 --> 00:43:32,499
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, I do believe that that area would be referred to as a sleepy hollow.

647
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:48,483
[SPEAKER_08]: And if it's my understanding, there is a maintenance agreement between the DCR and the city of Medford, where the city of Medford actually agrees to maintain and control the cleanliness of that area, if I'm not mistaken.

648
00:43:49,204 --> 00:43:51,924
[SPEAKER_06]: I see the DOT down there cleaning it, but they've been down there.

649
00:43:53,205 --> 00:43:54,625
[SPEAKER_06]: But right now, no one's cleaning it again.

650
00:43:56,037 --> 00:44:05,261
[SPEAKER_07]: are, just for my clarity, this is a, are you referring to the park across the footbridge behind Medford Square?

651
00:44:09,243 --> 00:44:11,424
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that when you say sleeping on the condon shell?

652
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:13,344
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, right, right.

653
00:44:13,404 --> 00:44:15,065
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that this is actually about the,

654
00:44:17,947 --> 00:44:19,909
[SPEAKER_07]: expressway for lack of a better word.

655
00:44:19,949 --> 00:44:20,469
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

656
00:44:20,609 --> 00:44:21,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

657
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:21,650
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to look.

658
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:22,050
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

659
00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:22,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

660
00:44:22,711 --> 00:44:25,433
[SPEAKER_06]: And it goes from that part of the road that goes all the way down to there.

661
00:44:25,773 --> 00:44:27,975
[SPEAKER_06]: There's crap all over, there's crap on the islands.

662
00:44:28,395 --> 00:44:30,377
[SPEAKER_06]: So you go by, there's mattresses on the side of the road.

663
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:31,177
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's, it's.

664
00:44:31,538 --> 00:44:31,678
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

665
00:44:31,718 --> 00:44:34,100
[SPEAKER_07]: You're, you're talking about exit 31 and then.

666
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:34,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

667
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:34,880
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

668
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:39,163
[SPEAKER_06]: As soon as you cross over the bridge there, it's a mess.

669
00:44:39,484 --> 00:44:42,726
[SPEAKER_06]: From the middle of the mall to when you get off the exit, crap all over the road.

670
00:44:43,507 --> 00:44:43,687
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

671
00:44:45,407 --> 00:44:51,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and I think it's both sides, it's the side behind the police station, DPW, and the other side of 93.

672
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:52,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's a total mess.

673
00:44:53,711 --> 00:44:54,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

674
00:44:54,491 --> 00:44:55,712
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Kerrio.

675
00:44:55,852 --> 00:44:56,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Any further discussion?

676
00:44:57,692 --> 00:44:58,213
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Sang?

677
00:44:58,833 --> 00:45:04,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Just wanted to agree, and just note that this is also an environmental issue, the amount of pollution that's out there.

678
00:45:05,776 --> 00:45:06,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

679
00:45:07,076 --> 00:45:07,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Any further discussion?

680
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:12,184
[SPEAKER_07]: I said I would not do this, but I'm gonna do it.

681
00:45:13,245 --> 00:45:18,790
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a pet peeve of mine, the condition, especially with state controlled roads in our community.

682
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:25,576
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not gonna, in previous times that you brought this up, I've amended this to list eight other places that we need cleaned or maintained.

683
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:31,060
[SPEAKER_07]: And as a resident of a DCR road as well, I understand it.

684
00:45:33,324 --> 00:45:40,487
[SPEAKER_07]: And what I'm about to say is not meant to be an excuse at all, but I was just reading today a report that DCR's funding has been cut almost 20% since 2009.

685
00:45:41,087 --> 00:45:43,588
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're really seeing the impacts of that.

686
00:45:43,768 --> 00:45:46,649
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to work with DCR workers through their union.

687
00:45:47,489 --> 00:45:52,431
[SPEAKER_07]: They're seeing the impact at state parks and recreation facilities, on the parkways that DCR maintains.

688
00:45:52,711 --> 00:45:57,993
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a severe issue, a severe budgetary issue, the austerity that's been imposed on DCR.

689
00:45:58,954 --> 00:46:02,135
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm not gonna file any amendments or anything to that effect tonight,

690
00:46:03,075 --> 00:46:19,101
[SPEAKER_07]: Our DCR needs support, and I hope that MassDOT and DCR can come down and do this right now, but in the long run, unless the state takes action, which I'm glad you're referring this to state delegation, those budgets need to go up if we're gonna have the level of services that we deserve.

691
00:46:21,282 --> 00:46:23,603
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Councilor Caravaglio, seconded by?

692
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:25,903
[SPEAKER_07]: Seconded by Councilor Sang.

693
00:46:25,964 --> 00:46:28,224
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk, as amended by Councilor Caravaglio.

694
00:46:28,364 --> 00:46:29,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

695
00:46:33,326 --> 00:46:33,647
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

696
00:46:33,747 --> 00:46:33,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

697
00:46:33,907 --> 00:46:34,087
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

698
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:38,791
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

699
00:46:38,811 --> 00:46:39,032
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

700
00:46:39,272 --> 00:46:40,933
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

701
00:46:41,174 --> 00:46:50,202
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes 70 affirmative zero and the negative emotion passes 22 to 030 offered by Councillor Collins and Councillor saying.

702
00:46:58,868 --> 00:47:08,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas our city is in the process of moving forward from the December, 2021 holiday extravaganza, where an inaccurate and offensive image meant to depict the Hanukkah menorah was displayed.

703
00:47:08,651 --> 00:47:17,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas City Hall and all public venues must be spaces where people from any and all faith, cultural and ethnic backgrounds may feel an equal sense of welcome, inclusion, safety, and belonging.

704
00:47:17,153 --> 00:47:23,375
[SPEAKER_07]: To be a resolve that the Medford City Council affirm the administration's renewed efforts to cultivate robust community engagement

705
00:47:23,855 --> 00:47:32,682
[SPEAKER_07]: and the planning of municipal events and strengthen relationships with our city's many faith, cultural and ethnic community groups in order to make City Hall a more inclusive and welcoming space for all.

706
00:47:33,323 --> 00:47:45,893
[SPEAKER_07]: Be it further resolved that the administration provide the Medford City Council with an update on its plans to improve community engagement and strengthen relationships with groups that are underrepresented in City Hall, including, but not limited to, Medford's Jewish communities.

707
00:47:45,993 --> 00:47:46,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Collins.

708
00:47:48,095 --> 00:47:50,177
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Vice President Beers.

709
00:47:50,674 --> 00:47:52,276
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for reading that whole thing.

710
00:47:54,037 --> 00:48:01,745
[SPEAKER_00]: So this resolution is not intended to point fingers or rehash an incident that we already know about.

711
00:48:02,366 --> 00:48:07,852
[SPEAKER_00]: This resolution is intended to follow up on the work that the administration has begun in the wake of the offensive menorah display.

712
00:48:08,392 --> 00:48:10,054
[SPEAKER_00]: at the holiday extravaganza in December.

713
00:48:10,835 --> 00:48:25,872
[SPEAKER_00]: We're aware that the administration has taken some good first steps and to move forward from that event, including starting the conversation with representatives from Temple Shalom da Marion Ryan, the anti defamation league and city hall staff and beginning to plan some trainings.

714
00:48:27,534 --> 00:48:43,370
[SPEAKER_00]: My intent is to affirm that the goal here should be to create a culture of inclusion and broad community engagement within City Hall, and with the planning of city events specifically, so much so that offensive incidents like the menorah display are just not possible to happen anymore.

715
00:48:44,271 --> 00:49:03,475
[SPEAKER_00]: aspire for this administration to have such strong relationships across our many faith and cultural and ethnic communities and be so and get so good at inviting people into City Hall and to our event planning processes that this kind of unfortunate yet human error wouldn't ever make it into the final version of a city event.

716
00:49:04,155 --> 00:49:09,216
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm happy to see that the work to move forward has begun and we want to confirm that this work is really necessary.

717
00:49:10,076 --> 00:49:28,367
[SPEAKER_00]: not just because of the menorah display and to heal ties with the Jewish community members who were alienated by it, but rather that, you know, to say that it's necessary in any case to make this city hall a place where people from any background can feel represented and feel belonging because that's what a city hall really needs to be to be successful.

718
00:49:28,888 --> 00:49:37,093
[SPEAKER_00]: So finally, you know, we want to request that update from the administration on what the next steps are to continue improving inclusion and engagement with the community.

719
00:49:37,133 --> 00:49:37,393
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

720
00:49:38,877 --> 00:49:39,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

721
00:49:39,637 --> 00:49:40,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Sang?

722
00:49:42,259 --> 00:49:52,704
[SPEAKER_05]: It's difficult to follow up such an eloquent explanation of this resolution, but I just wanted to give a little bit of anecdotal experience about growing up here in Medford.

723
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:58,707
[SPEAKER_05]: As someone who came from a different faith and cultural background, it wasn't always easy.

724
00:49:58,747 --> 00:50:01,068
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, you would never, you

725
00:50:01,928 --> 00:50:06,733
[SPEAKER_05]: You wouldn't always have accurate depictions of your culture or the culture in which you grew up in.

726
00:50:07,934 --> 00:50:16,483
[SPEAKER_05]: But I am happy that our city has been making progress on this front over the last decade, especially.

727
00:50:16,783 --> 00:50:20,787
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just wanted to acknowledge that there's still a lot of work to be done.

728
00:50:22,369 --> 00:50:34,947
[SPEAKER_05]: And our, you know, communities of faith or cultural communities, ethnic communities here are counting on us to be the leaders in making sure that we get this right and that we build a city that's as inclusive as possible.

729
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:42,412
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot that we haven't talked about as a city that I think merits discussion.

730
00:50:42,832 --> 00:50:44,953
[SPEAKER_05]: Antisemitism is one of those topics.

731
00:50:45,013 --> 00:50:57,197
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had recorded incidents of antisemitism in this city, of antisemitic attacks, violence, depictions.

732
00:50:58,078 --> 00:51:04,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Very unfortunately, we've had swastikas carved into fence posts and public spaces here.

733
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:08,002
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's time for us to step up and address all these issues.

734
00:51:08,202 --> 00:51:24,672
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I'm, you know, we're, Councilor Collins and I are here today to make sure that, to reaffirm the work that our city is doing so far and to make sure that we are moving forward and we're challenging ourselves to move as inclusive a direction as possible.

735
00:51:24,692 --> 00:51:27,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Sang.

736
00:51:28,474 --> 00:51:31,436
[SPEAKER_07]: Seconded on the motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Knight.

737
00:51:32,356 --> 00:51:33,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Any further discussion?

738
00:51:34,119 --> 00:51:34,801
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scarpelli.

739
00:51:34,882 --> 00:51:36,287
[SPEAKER_09]: Real quick, thank you for bringing this forward.

740
00:51:36,869 --> 00:51:40,642
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's important that what Councilor Collins mentioned that

741
00:51:41,514 --> 00:51:44,837
[SPEAKER_09]: people have to realize that this building is for everyone.

742
00:51:45,457 --> 00:51:59,668
[SPEAKER_09]: And having the opportunity for this building to represent everybody and that it gives everybody an opportunity to come here and express how they feel or what they feel what's going on in the city, how they can, how we can make it better.

743
00:51:59,688 --> 00:52:06,393
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, this past holiday event where unfortunately,

744
00:52:07,308 --> 00:52:10,829
[SPEAKER_09]: There was some unfortunate misrepresentations.

745
00:52:10,889 --> 00:52:22,073
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that it's good to see that the city moving forward and openly discussing it and sharing it with the community and the plans and how we can correct this so it doesn't happen again.

746
00:52:22,173 --> 00:52:23,294
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you.

747
00:52:24,514 --> 00:52:25,574
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, councilor Scarpelli.

748
00:52:26,335 --> 00:52:32,737
[SPEAKER_07]: Any further discussion on the motion of councilor Collins and councilor saying seconded.

749
00:52:32,777 --> 00:52:35,758
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, technically the motion of councilor Collins seconded by councilor Knight.

750
00:52:36,253 --> 00:52:37,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

751
00:52:39,635 --> 00:52:39,775
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

752
00:52:39,795 --> 00:52:39,875
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

753
00:52:40,075 --> 00:52:40,255
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

754
00:52:40,435 --> 00:52:40,755
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

755
00:52:41,636 --> 00:52:41,816
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

756
00:52:41,836 --> 00:52:41,916
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

757
00:52:41,976 --> 00:52:42,276
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

758
00:52:42,496 --> 00:52:42,636
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

759
00:52:55,214 --> 00:52:58,175
[SPEAKER_07]: 22-031 offered by Councilor Sang.

760
00:52:58,235 --> 00:53:08,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Be it resolved that the city council ask the city administration for an update on COVID-19 response plans for city senior living facilities given the recent surge in COVID-19 cases.

761
00:53:08,197 --> 00:53:08,777
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Sang.

762
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:09,797
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

763
00:53:10,517 --> 00:53:15,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Last week we hit in our state record highs in terms of COVID-19 cases.

764
00:53:15,218 --> 00:53:22,600
[SPEAKER_05]: And even though we know that the circumstances are different from where we were two years ago, there are still community concerns about

765
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:29,024
[SPEAKER_05]: on the spread of COVID-19 and the risk that this poses to our senior citizens living in senior living facilities here.

766
00:53:29,605 --> 00:53:33,768
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, especially given previous records, both in the city and nationally.

767
00:53:34,228 --> 00:53:44,335
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I propose this resolution to make sure that we are all informed as a community as to what our city is doing to make sure that our senior citizens are as safe as possible.

768
00:53:46,295 --> 00:53:46,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Carviello.

769
00:53:48,176 --> 00:53:55,277
[SPEAKER_06]: If my fellow council would like, would amend that to also include the nursing homes that we have in the city of Medford.

770
00:53:55,357 --> 00:54:01,399
[SPEAKER_06]: My dad happens to be one of them and I just got an update from one of them this afternoon saying how many people are sick in there.

771
00:54:01,779 --> 00:54:07,341
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you wouldn't mind amending that to bring in the nursing homes that are in the city of Medford also.

772
00:54:09,801 --> 00:54:10,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Carviello.

773
00:54:11,062 --> 00:54:11,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Nye.

774
00:54:11,973 --> 00:54:20,779
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Mr. President, I too would like to amend this further, just by asking that the administration respond to the Council in writing and then post it on the city website as well.

775
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:26,303
[SPEAKER_08]: So this information can be readily available to citizens in the community have concerns about their loved ones and such facilities.

776
00:54:27,704 --> 00:54:30,386
[SPEAKER_07]: That was to respond in writing and post on the city website.

777
00:54:32,367 --> 00:54:33,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Any further discussion.

778
00:54:38,384 --> 00:54:42,105
[SPEAKER_07]: just for my sake, I definitely support this.

779
00:54:43,546 --> 00:54:50,748
[SPEAKER_07]: And I noted today that governor Baker extended a booster mandate to people working in facilities like these.

780
00:54:51,208 --> 00:54:56,169
[SPEAKER_07]: So that is one thing I heard today, but definitely a lot of concerns from a lot of folks around this issue.

781
00:54:57,209 --> 00:55:04,632
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of councilor Seng, seconded by councilor Scarpelli, as amended by councilor Carviello and councilor Knight.

782
00:55:04,792 --> 00:55:05,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

783
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:09,521
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

784
00:55:12,524 --> 00:55:12,764
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

785
00:55:17,590 --> 00:55:17,830
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

786
00:55:19,632 --> 00:55:19,892
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

787
00:55:21,093 --> 00:55:21,754
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

788
00:55:22,094 --> 00:55:22,375
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

789
00:55:22,495 --> 00:55:23,436
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, 70 affirmative.

790
00:55:23,456 --> 00:55:24,797
[SPEAKER_07]: Sir, the negative emotion passes.

791
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:47,524
[SPEAKER_07]: 22034 offered by counselor saying whereas public health experts continue to recommend masking to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and whereas numerous public health experts now recommend that people wear KN95 and N95 masks given the spread of the Omicron variant, be it resolved that the Medford City Council ask the city administration to acquire KN95 masks approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health

792
00:55:47,984 --> 00:55:59,687
[SPEAKER_07]: and to develop a plan to distribute KN-95 masks to priority groups, including municipal and school workers, individuals at a higher risk for severe COVID-19, and residents to whom purchasing masks presents a financial burden.

793
00:55:59,888 --> 00:56:00,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Councillor Tsai.

794
00:56:00,908 --> 00:56:01,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

795
00:56:02,228 --> 00:56:05,169
[SPEAKER_05]: We know that Omicron is a more transmissible variant.

796
00:56:05,489 --> 00:56:07,650
[SPEAKER_05]: We're seeing the results of that in our case count today.

797
00:56:09,091 --> 00:56:22,926
[SPEAKER_05]: We also today, the CDC officials have confirmed that they are looking at updating mask guidance to recommend N95 and KN95 masks be worn.

798
00:56:23,987 --> 00:56:27,151
[SPEAKER_05]: And experts at top medical institutions have raised

799
00:56:27,651 --> 00:56:38,355
[SPEAKER_05]: this issue that we should be we should be distributing more KN95 masks to everyone and making sure that we are wearing these more protective masks.

800
00:56:38,875 --> 00:56:46,077
[SPEAKER_05]: You know it's given given all of these all the recent recommendations and given the possible change in guidance from the CDC.

801
00:56:47,978 --> 00:56:50,079
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be harder and harder to secure masks.

802
00:56:50,299 --> 00:56:57,402
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's already difficult for many people to figure out what's a counterfeit mask and what's not to secure those orders online.

803
00:56:57,422 --> 00:57:03,404
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm proposing this because I think we need to keep our workers safe.

804
00:57:03,464 --> 00:57:05,145
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we need to keep us all safe.

805
00:57:06,165 --> 00:57:13,087
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we need to mitigate the financial burden that mask buying can pose to a lot of working class families in this town.

806
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:20,069
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also believe that if we are asking people to mask as a city, we should give them the means to do so.

807
00:57:20,810 --> 00:57:30,913
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, we need to address the problem of counterfeits, which is why I added the line about the National Institute for Occupational Safety.

808
00:57:33,472 --> 00:57:49,684
[SPEAKER_05]: We, I left out N95 masks because currently CDC guidance does not recommend that we stockpile N95 masks because they are, they should be treated as priority for medical staff.

809
00:57:50,504 --> 00:57:57,570
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to be transparent about that point and explain why this resolution focuses on KN95 masks.

810
00:58:00,512 --> 00:58:01,372
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Seng.

811
00:58:01,412 --> 00:58:01,973
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Collins.

812
00:58:02,865 --> 00:58:05,688
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you and thank you councillor saying for bringing this forward.

813
00:58:06,108 --> 00:58:09,111
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that this is a great thing to see the city lead on.

814
00:58:10,072 --> 00:58:20,883
[SPEAKER_00]: I too have heard the recent guidance about how it's true, and 95, but you know more to the point KN 95 are more protective and surgical masks they're certainly more protective and cloth masks.

815
00:58:21,463 --> 00:58:32,170
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think at the point that you know we're trying to the administration is trying to do all it can to keep our residents, safe, correct masking is a huge part of that.

816
00:58:32,630 --> 00:58:39,175
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to evolve our guidance with the evolving nature of the virus with the infection levels in our community and I think

817
00:58:39,595 --> 00:58:44,658
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor Seng brings up a great point that it's increasingly difficult to find masks.

818
00:58:44,718 --> 00:58:58,687
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think people are feeling kind of out in the wind when it comes to being able to source masks that will protect them, that will help them not keep the virus, not bring the virus home to their families, you know, kind of regardless of vaccination status, because that's where we're at in this pandemic.

819
00:58:59,728 --> 00:59:07,813
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think if there is a, if there's a way for this administration to source masks so that we can better protect the people in our community,

820
00:59:08,593 --> 00:59:20,139
[SPEAKER_00]: that are most in need of them, people who can't work from home, people who work for the municipality, work for our schools, people who are disproportionately likely to be in infection prone scenarios.

821
00:59:20,919 --> 00:59:24,941
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to be doing all that we can to help protect those community members.

822
00:59:25,622 --> 00:59:28,863
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you, Councilor Sang, and I'll be strong in support of this today.

823
00:59:30,804 --> 00:59:33,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Any further discussion, Councilor President Morrell.

824
00:59:34,346 --> 00:59:35,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

825
00:59:35,086 --> 00:59:36,867
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank Councilor Sang for bringing this forward.

826
00:59:36,887 --> 00:59:37,668
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually raised

827
00:59:38,587 --> 00:59:44,611
[SPEAKER_03]: similar concerns about access and costs way back when, with the original mask mandates being put into place.

828
00:59:45,492 --> 00:59:49,815
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thank him for leaning on the administration to see what they can do here.

829
00:59:50,095 --> 00:59:56,439
[SPEAKER_03]: As with many things, unfortunately, it seems like the city and municipalities are the last line of defense with the least amount of funding.

830
00:59:56,499 --> 01:00:04,485
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would hope that our state leaders and our leaders at the federal level are looking into this as well, as they have vastly more funding than the city of Medford.

831
01:00:05,383 --> 01:00:08,906
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate the assay administration and I really hope this is something we can do.

832
01:00:08,926 --> 01:00:09,487
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.

833
01:00:11,428 --> 01:00:12,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, President Morrell.

834
01:00:12,649 --> 01:00:13,630
[SPEAKER_07]: Any further discussion?

835
01:00:13,650 --> 01:00:18,794
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just gonna put one more piece of information out there.

836
01:00:18,834 --> 01:00:23,238
[SPEAKER_07]: There's an incredibly helpful chart published in the Wall Street Journal last week.

837
01:00:24,933 --> 01:00:35,797
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have one person who is infected and one person who's not infected, standing about six feet apart, if neither of them are wearing any sort of mask, it will take about 15 minutes to transmit a infectious dose.

838
01:00:36,697 --> 01:00:39,638
[SPEAKER_07]: If they're both wearing cloth masks, it would take about 27 minutes.

839
01:00:40,199 --> 01:00:42,540
[SPEAKER_07]: If they're both wearing surgical masks, it would take about one hour.

840
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:50,202
[SPEAKER_07]: If they're both wearing a non-fit tested KN95 or N95, it would take 25 hours to transmit.

841
01:00:50,262 --> 01:00:51,723
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a significant increase

842
01:00:52,463 --> 01:00:55,924
[SPEAKER_07]: in protection if, you know, with a little bit of a change to the mask that you're wearing.

843
01:00:56,724 --> 01:01:03,885
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're using a tightly sealed fitted N95, if both people are using that, you would have 2,500 hours of protection.

844
01:01:04,045 --> 01:01:10,327
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a really significant difference between the different types of masking.

845
01:01:11,207 --> 01:01:16,468
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was just really a helpful way for me to learn about that.

846
01:01:18,277 --> 01:01:24,218
[SPEAKER_07]: Seeing no further discussion on the motion of Councillor saying seconded by Councillor Collins.

847
01:01:25,179 --> 01:01:26,319
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

848
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:31,260
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

849
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:31,740
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

850
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:32,300
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

851
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:33,940
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

852
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:34,441
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

853
01:01:44,222 --> 01:01:46,107
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

854
01:01:46,127 --> 01:01:46,849
[SPEAKER_07]: The motion passes.

855
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:48,955
[SPEAKER_07]: 22-035 offered by Councilor Sang.

856
01:01:51,204 --> 01:02:15,486
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas Mayor Loco Kern and the Medford Board of Health have declared racism to be a public health crisis, and whereas the Center for Disease Control cites more COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, deaths, and mental health challenges in areas where racial and ethnic minority groups live, learn, work, play, and worship, explained through discrimination, limited healthcare access and use, occupational, educational income and wealth gaps, and crowded housing conditions,

857
01:02:16,046 --> 01:02:37,013
[SPEAKER_07]: be it resolved that the Medford City Council ask for an update from the city administration on its plans to achieve an equitable response to the current COVID-19 surge, and be it further resolved that the Medford City Council ask the city administration to increase free COVID-19 testing, vaccination opportunities, contact tracing, and public information efforts in the neighborhoods and communities that are disproportionately lower income and or non-white.

858
01:02:37,153 --> 01:02:38,013
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Sang.

859
01:02:38,566 --> 01:02:39,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

860
01:02:39,967 --> 01:03:04,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Where our statements give much of the reason for this resolution, we know that when we look at the effect of COVID-19, when we look at the spread, the severity, when we look at numbers such as vaccination rates, we see that working class communities and non-white communities have been suffering disproportionately from the COVID-19 pandemic.

861
01:03:04,548 --> 01:03:06,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Medford is no exception to this rule.

862
01:03:07,089 --> 01:03:14,771
[SPEAKER_05]: There is unfortunately a vaccination gap in town for the BIPOC community.

863
01:03:15,152 --> 01:03:21,674
[SPEAKER_05]: We also know that there's more that we can do as a city to address these issues.

864
01:03:22,794 --> 01:03:28,396
[SPEAKER_05]: The city council and the city government labeled racism as a public health crisis.

865
01:03:28,476 --> 01:03:29,956
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is following up on that

866
01:03:32,618 --> 01:03:55,649
[SPEAKER_05]: action back last year or back then, I believe that we need to be consistent in our actions and that by uplifting the working class, by uplifting BIPOC folks, by uplifting marginalized folks, we are uplifting us, all of us, and keeping all of us safer, keeping every single one of us safer.

867
01:03:59,103 --> 01:04:01,145
[SPEAKER_05]: I that's why I'm putting this forward.

868
01:04:01,245 --> 01:04:06,429
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm aware that the city has taken a few measures on this front.

869
01:04:06,549 --> 01:04:17,917
[SPEAKER_05]: We, the city administration's let me know that they have, they've increased some public public health information campaigns in

870
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:26,094
[SPEAKER_05]: neighborhoods of color, they have been working with faith leaders and community leaders to make sure that we are vaccinating as many people as possible.

871
01:04:26,635 --> 01:04:32,677
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think many of us have the question of what what comes next, how are we responding to the surge?

872
01:04:32,717 --> 01:04:33,317
[SPEAKER_05]: How can we?

873
01:04:33,557 --> 01:04:35,138
[SPEAKER_05]: How can we help as a city council?

874
01:04:35,198 --> 01:04:36,438
[SPEAKER_05]: How can we help as a community?

875
01:04:37,138 --> 01:04:38,799
[SPEAKER_05]: And how can we do better?

876
01:04:38,839 --> 01:04:41,080
[SPEAKER_05]: And how can we evaluate what we're doing?

877
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:43,901
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is why I'm putting this forward today.

878
01:04:45,962 --> 01:04:46,882
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Sang.

879
01:04:48,401 --> 01:04:49,202
[SPEAKER_07]: Any discussion?

880
01:04:49,522 --> 01:04:50,263
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Collins.

881
01:04:51,164 --> 01:04:52,065
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Councilor Sang.

882
01:04:52,125 --> 01:05:03,196
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I think some of the last points that you raised really speak to the heart of this, which is, you know, what being able to track and assess what are we doing, what's left to do, how can we help more?

883
01:05:03,236 --> 01:05:07,500
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also want to echo a comment that President Morrell made on the previous paper.

884
01:05:08,074 --> 01:05:14,397
[SPEAKER_00]: regarding how truly tragic it is that so much of the pandemic response has been left to local governments.

885
01:05:15,678 --> 01:05:23,501
[SPEAKER_00]: And I certainly hope that we can take these lessons forward as a nation for our next, God forbid, public health emergency.

886
01:05:23,581 --> 01:05:32,846
[SPEAKER_00]: But as the case is that a lot of responsibility has fallen on the shoulders of our local boards of health nationwide, we still need to be saying, how can we bring up the baseline?

887
01:05:33,206 --> 01:05:35,347
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we make sure that we're achieving an equitable response

888
01:05:35,687 --> 01:05:37,388
[SPEAKER_00]: how much more can we be doing?

889
01:05:37,408 --> 01:05:55,196
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd love to see this administration look into keeping up the vaccination clinics, continuing to reevaluate our mask mandates, ability to share and distribute medical resources, looking into PCR testing for our community, the things that are very, very hard for residents to find on their own.

890
01:05:56,076 --> 01:05:57,897
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you again for bringing this up, Councilor Sang.

891
01:06:00,058 --> 01:06:01,078
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

892
01:06:01,238 --> 01:06:02,119
[SPEAKER_07]: Any further discussion?

893
01:06:06,034 --> 01:06:11,677
[SPEAKER_07]: Seeing none, motion by Councillor Knight to approve, seconded by Councillor Scarpelli.

894
01:06:12,057 --> 01:06:13,138
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

895
01:06:34,977 --> 01:06:37,939

896
01:06:38,739 --> 01:06:40,980

897
01:06:43,082 --> 01:06:47,044
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Knight to take papers under suspension.

898

[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

905
01:07:07,609 --> 01:07:07,849
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

906
01:07:10,290 --> 01:07:22,796
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, 70 affirmative zero and the negative motion passes 22 036 offered by Councilor Carvio be it resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate the Elliott Pearson Children's School at Tufts University on celebrating its 100th year.

907
01:07:23,316 --> 01:07:26,178
[SPEAKER_07]: The Elliott Pearson School has served countless children and families in Medford.

908
01:07:26,578 --> 01:07:31,720
[SPEAKER_07]: and the Elliott Pearson Children's School is one of the first nursery schools in the country and soon became a training school for new teachers.

909
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:38,622
[SPEAKER_07]: The school has served as a high-quality laboratory and demonstration school, serving children from diverse backgrounds in Medford.

910
01:07:39,322 --> 01:07:55,608
[SPEAKER_07]: The school also serves as a teacher training and research site for undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral students applying for scholarships to practice, being so resolved that the Medford City Council thanks the faculty and staff at the Elliott Pearson Children's School and congratulates them on 100 years of outstanding service to the children and families of Medford

911
01:07:55,968 --> 01:07:58,970
[SPEAKER_07]: best wishes for the next 100 years, Councilor Garavaglio.

912
01:07:59,330 --> 01:08:00,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

913
01:08:00,110 --> 01:08:07,995
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, Mr. President, I would guarantee a lot of people don't even know the Elliott Pearson School even exists in the city of Medford.

914
01:08:08,655 --> 01:08:14,218
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a school that's been run by Tufts University for all these years, and again,

915
01:08:15,549 --> 01:08:24,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Touch being the institution that it is, has put out high quality teachers, and this has been a study group for teachers and things like that.

916
01:08:25,852 --> 01:08:28,253
[SPEAKER_06]: I was lucky to have a couple of my kids get to go there.

917
01:08:29,394 --> 01:08:34,375
[SPEAKER_06]: That was maybe 30 years ago, but maybe a little longer, 40 years ago.

918
01:08:35,375 --> 01:08:38,136
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, I'd say it's a good program.

919
01:08:38,356 --> 01:08:39,437
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a quiet program.

920
01:08:39,537 --> 01:08:42,718
[SPEAKER_06]: If you ask so many people, they probably don't even know that the place even exists.

921
01:08:43,542 --> 01:08:52,369
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, I just want to thank Tufts and the students that go there and the things they learned there and their continued success.

922
01:08:53,610 --> 01:08:54,911
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Kerrio.

923
01:08:55,151 --> 01:08:56,152

[SPEAKER_07]: Seeing none, we'll move on to the records.

938
01:09:43,205 --> 01:09:47,266

[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Collins, how did you find those records?

940
01:09:49,247 --> 01:09:50,207
[SPEAKER_00]: I found them to be in order.
