I'm present as well so let's move recording stop recording in progress.

19
00:02:15,456 --> 00:02:29,666
Do we have the main item on the agenda tonight is site plan review recommendations to the Zoning Board of Appeals for 4054 Mystic Valley Parkway rise together development.

20
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:39,593
Amanda, would you like to say a few words or should we move right into the proponent giving their presentation?

21
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,352
I will hand it off to the proponent team.

22
00:02:45,213 --> 00:02:54,241
Quinn, and actually, so I have Quinlan, is there anyone else that, and if you could just raise your hand, that you want me to give sharing permissions to?

23
00:02:56,963 --> 00:03:09,053
Yes, so it'll be, Q3 is gonna be running the presentation here, so I know Brian O'Connor's on here, I'm not sure if it's him or someone else running the presentation though.

24
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:10,594
This is Brian, I'll be running it,

25
00:03:11,187 --> 00:03:12,528
Quinlan, unless there's a problem.

26
00:03:13,188 --> 00:03:16,570
So you should be able to share now.

27
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:31,498
Okay, great.

28
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:37,281
And Amanda, feel free to let me know if I should start now.

29
00:03:39,402 --> 00:03:39,802
Go for it.

30
00:03:39,962 --> 00:03:40,102
Yeah.

31
00:03:41,617 --> 00:03:44,159
Well, good evening, Mr. Chairman and members of the board.

32
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:46,141
Thank you so much for your time this evening.

33
00:03:46,161 --> 00:03:47,522
My name is Clement Locke.

34
00:03:47,582 --> 00:03:53,066
I'm a project manager at Rise Together at 12 Erickson Street in Dorchester, Mass, 02122.

35
00:03:53,927 --> 00:04:01,754
And we are very excited to present to you tonight this proposed life science project at 4054 Mystic Valley Parkway.

36
00:04:01,814 --> 00:04:08,139
And before we dive in, I just really quickly wanted to thank city departments who have taken the time to weigh in on this project.

37
00:04:08,653 --> 00:04:18,317
We know a lot of time and effort goes into these reviews and we really do appreciate everything that's been done to date and look forward to continuing to make this project the best that it can be.

38
00:04:19,038 --> 00:04:26,201
And here you'll see that our project team comprised of many teams that have experienced both in Medford and in the life science industry.

39
00:04:27,021 --> 00:04:33,704
We have members available from each team here tonight to make sure we can answer any questions or comments that come up at the end of the presentation.

40
00:04:33,884 --> 00:04:36,265
And you'll be hearing from some of them as well in just a moment.

41
00:04:36,888 --> 00:04:42,573
and we'll also make sure that this presentation is made available to the board for their review at the end of the presentation.

42
00:04:43,733 --> 00:04:44,514
Next slide, please.

43
00:04:46,736 --> 00:04:53,181
On the ownership and development side, the project team and RISE have partnered with the Matarazzo family in Medford to bring this project to life.

44
00:04:53,781 --> 00:05:03,709
The family is also very excited to continue working with the city and the community on creating a project that truly benefits the area and incorporates important city goals and initiatives.

45
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:04,790
Next slide.

46
00:05:09,882 --> 00:05:24,212
And for those who aren't familiar with the site, it's located right along Mystic Valley Parkway, Route 16 in the red area shown, bordered by the parkway and Tobrit McDonald State Park to the south and radio towers occupying the wetlands area to the north.

47
00:05:24,972 --> 00:05:29,755
To the bottom right, you can see Wellington Orange Line Station on the T on the map.

48
00:05:30,816 --> 00:05:33,678
And that's right across Wellington Circle.

49
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:38,862
And to the left, you'll see Meadowland Plaza, as well as the intersection at Locust Street.

50
00:05:39,202 --> 00:05:39,482
Next slide.

51
00:05:42,715 --> 00:05:48,499
So about a year ago, we started analyzing some of the history of the site, as well as what's happening on the site today.

52
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:56,525
The site was primarily marshlands through the 1930s until Ralph's Potato Factory and Laboratory opened in the 1940s.

53
00:05:56,765 --> 00:06:00,868
And then in 1993, Ratutu came in and has been there ever since.

54
00:06:01,768 --> 00:06:09,854
The surrounding area has a similar history, having mainly served commercial, industrial, and retail uses since the 1940s, as you can see below.

55
00:06:10,874 --> 00:06:11,535
Next slide, please.

56
00:06:14,325 --> 00:06:17,766
and today the area is in the early stages of multiple changes.

57
00:06:18,466 --> 00:06:24,767
The Wellington Circle study continues to progress forward, important transportation improvements in the area.

58
00:06:25,707 --> 00:06:43,250
McDonald State Park is seeing increased usage due to efforts by local nonprofits such as Mystic River Watershed Association, and a comprehensive plan is being put forth by the city that will set forth guidelines on how to address key areas such as economic development, climate resiliency, and mobility.

59
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:50,897
Most of these goals align with our own and are outlined with an important feedback we received from the city departments as well.

60
00:06:52,198 --> 00:07:01,988
We started to incorporate benefits into this project, such as improved public realm and retail at the front edge of the site and incorporating community space at the ground level to be used.

61
00:07:03,796 --> 00:07:16,683
We're also studying new benefits suggested by these departments, including a new pedestrian crossing at 4054 Mystic Valley Parkway that will improve future connections from the project site to the Tolbert McDonald State Park.

62
00:07:17,884 --> 00:07:18,544
Next slide, please.

63
00:07:21,686 --> 00:07:26,709
And with that in mind, it was clear that life science at this location could help us achieve all these goals.

64
00:07:26,849 --> 00:07:31,432
Not only could we protect the historic use of the area as industrial and commercial,

65
00:07:32,206 --> 00:07:44,729
We could use the development as a catalyst for economic growth, achieve climate resiliency and mobility goals, and utilize our project team and future tenants to create new connections and opportunities for the city of Medford.

66
00:07:45,649 --> 00:07:53,031
With this in mind, our project team began to move forward with designing a truly state of the art building that would indeed meet these goals.

67
00:07:53,911 --> 00:07:54,551
Next slide, please.

68
00:07:57,273 --> 00:07:59,113
And we started with the existing conditions.

69
00:08:00,054 --> 00:08:06,575
Today, as noted, the project sits at 4054 Mystic Valley Parkway and is Bertucci's.

70
00:08:07,075 --> 00:08:13,857
You can see the building Bertucci's in the middle of the lot there in the gray square, as well as pictures of the building on the side.

71
00:08:15,117 --> 00:08:19,578
And around the building is mostly surface parking that is used today for the restaurants.

72
00:08:21,179 --> 00:08:26,260
To the east, you'll have the communications building that services the radio towers.

73
00:08:27,435 --> 00:08:31,837
To the north, you'll have the wetland site that is where the radio towers sit.

74
00:08:32,758 --> 00:08:35,179
To the west, you have what's currently a trial court.

75
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:37,460
And to the south, you have Mystic Valley Parkway.

76
00:08:37,521 --> 00:08:40,162
And just across from Mystic Valley Parkway is the state park.

77
00:08:41,042 --> 00:08:47,766
And at this point, I'd like to hand it over to our civil engineer team at BHB to continue with the presentation.

78
00:08:47,806 --> 00:08:48,086
Thank you.

79
00:08:50,007 --> 00:08:50,588
Yeah, thanks, Quinn.

80
00:08:50,608 --> 00:08:51,368
Can you guys hear me all right?

81
00:08:52,869 --> 00:08:53,009
Yep.

82
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:54,250
All right, great.

83
00:08:55,216 --> 00:08:56,616
My name is Tim Smith, I'm with VHB.

84
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:59,777
I'm just going to be talking real quick about the proposed development here.

85
00:08:59,797 --> 00:09:03,078
I just wanted to highlight a few things.

86
00:09:03,478 --> 00:09:08,240
The existing site, the Bertucci's, it's mainly an impervious site.

87
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:15,462
What you're going to see here, we've tried to maximize green space where we can, but it's also going to be mainly impervious.

88
00:09:17,942 --> 00:09:22,664
Another item we wanted to point out, the drive aisle coming off of Mystic Valley Parkway.

89
00:09:22,704 --> 00:09:23,964
It's a one-way drive aisle.

90
00:09:24,675 --> 00:09:25,296
20 feet wide.

91
00:09:26,437 --> 00:09:36,665
It's designed to accommodate both all the fire apparatus vehicles that could be coming to the site as well as the delivery trucks.

92
00:09:38,087 --> 00:09:43,271
On the east side, we have our loading dock, the northwest side is the garage access.

93
00:09:45,173 --> 00:09:51,938
We also wanted to note on this slide that, excuse me, that

94
00:09:53,328 --> 00:09:59,352
There is a perimeter fence and retaining wall that will that will go around the perimeter of the site.

95
00:10:02,915 --> 00:10:03,255
Next slide.

96
00:10:07,058 --> 00:10:12,202
And focusing really mainly for this slide on the on the right the drainage, the grading drainage and utilities.

97
00:10:13,262 --> 00:10:20,087
The site was graded to stay as high as possible to account for future flooding conditions.

98
00:10:22,677 --> 00:10:23,965
basically the site plateaus.

99
00:10:25,557 --> 00:10:32,783
The existing conditions drain to the rear of the site, and we have tried to accommodate that as well in our design.

100
00:10:33,443 --> 00:10:36,506
I would like to point out that due to the structure below.

101
00:10:36,966 --> 00:10:43,531
There are a few places where we will be piping stormwater through the building to account for that and to mimic the existing drainage patterns.

102
00:10:44,752 --> 00:10:47,474
Utility wise water sewer and gas.

103
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:54,380
They will all tie into the existing mains that run along the mystic Valley Parkway right of way.

104
00:10:55,343 --> 00:10:58,047
and there is an existing electric on site that we'll be tying into.

105
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:05,616
And if there are any other questions, we wanted to be brief with these slides.

106
00:11:05,656 --> 00:11:07,839
If there are any other questions, we'll be available at the end.

107
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:13,025
And Mike Rittenmeyer with MDLA is going to take over from here.

108
00:11:13,246 --> 00:11:13,486
Thank you.

109
00:11:14,963 --> 00:11:15,383
Thanks, Tim.

110
00:11:15,403 --> 00:11:19,747
Hi everyone, my name is Mike Rattenmayer, I'm a landscape architect at MDLA.

111
00:11:20,608 --> 00:11:23,130
There's two slides I'm going to review with you.

112
00:11:24,011 --> 00:11:25,973
The first one here are some precedent images.

113
00:11:26,797 --> 00:11:29,219
primarily for the entry plaza that we're proposing.

114
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:35,945
This is meant to give you a character of the materials, the planting types that we'll be proposing for this project.

115
00:11:35,965 --> 00:11:44,612
So on the left side, you can see different types of grasses, large open plaza spaces, different opportunities for seating.

116
00:11:44,632 --> 00:11:56,061
And we think with this building use, creating outdoor space, different options for seating and gathering will work well, which is some of the images on the right.

117
00:11:57,069 --> 00:11:58,190
Next slide, please, Brian.

118
00:12:01,252 --> 00:12:06,937
So on the left is our overall site plan, similar, you know, the same view that Tim just walked you through.

119
00:12:07,357 --> 00:12:09,719
And on the right is an enlargement of the entry plaza.

120
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:24,130
On the left side, overall, starting at Mystic Valley Parkway, on the south side of the screen, or the lower side of the screen here, we are keeping the existing street trees that are along the parkway, as well as proposing a new

121
00:12:25,191 --> 00:12:29,713
new street tree towards the western curb cut to the left where the cursor is.

122
00:12:30,574 --> 00:12:42,619
Working right into the site, there's going to be a new sidewalk, a generous landscape buffer with new shade trees, massing of shrubs and perennials, as well as a rain garden to help with green infrastructure and stormwater management.

123
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:48,002
The dark gray tone, I guess we could refer to the enlargement on the right, I apologize.

124
00:12:49,495 --> 00:13:09,775
As a this large sweeping seat wall that kind of defines the edge of the plaza with the amount of, you know, the traffic on mystic Valley Parkway we'd like to try and create a little bit of a quieter space, but then also find ways to invite you know with this being a public plaza invite you know visitors and the public into this plaza.

125
00:13:11,873 --> 00:13:18,476
You can see the different types of cafe tables sort of towards the center of the plaza that will be spill out from that use.

126
00:13:19,057 --> 00:13:31,043
And then again, different options throughout the plaza for seating, gathering, different uses of pavers to help delineate circulation to the main entry.

127
00:13:31,923 --> 00:13:38,186
And then moving back to the left and the overall site plan, as Tim mentioned, there is a screen fence going around

128
00:13:39,834 --> 00:13:42,695
wood screen fence going on the property line towards the rear.

129
00:13:43,235 --> 00:13:54,418
And then we did try and maximize green space and planting where we could along the backside of the building, primarily using native trees, shrubs, and perennials where possible.

130
00:13:56,199 --> 00:14:00,960
Again, if anyone has any questions towards the end of this presentation, happy to discuss.

131
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:04,781
I think with that, I'll turn it back to Brian.

132
00:14:05,556 --> 00:14:06,096
Great.

133
00:14:06,217 --> 00:14:07,377
Thank you, Mike.

134
00:14:07,477 --> 00:14:08,658
Brian O'Connor from Cube 3.

135
00:14:08,798 --> 00:14:17,265
I also have with me this evening Steven Prestonjohn from my office, and he'll be participating in any questions and answers as well.

136
00:14:18,105 --> 00:14:21,148
What we'd like to do is just walk you through the building fairly quickly.

137
00:14:21,228 --> 00:14:22,589
Again, we're going to keep it high level.

138
00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:31,776
This first slide really takes the site and identifies the property line with the inner circle, the vertuces in the center of the site.

139
00:14:31,876 --> 00:14:34,998
And then there's a dotted line 100 feet away indicating

140
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:38,533
overlap and adjacency to our neighbors.

141
00:14:38,774 --> 00:14:47,198
On the north of the site, or plan north right now, on number one, we have the district court at 4040 Mystic Valley Parkway.

142
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:50,719
We are within 100 feet of the edge of that building.

143
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:55,101
And then on the bottom of the page, we have two and three.

144
00:14:55,201 --> 00:14:58,723
Two is a communication facility that Quinlan had mentioned earlier.

145
00:14:59,724 --> 00:15:02,625
And then three is Century Ford on the bottom edge.

146
00:15:02,685 --> 00:15:04,446
So these are all fairly low,

147
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:13,627
structures that are really not doing a particularly good job of defining a public edge or creating a walkable path along Mystic Valley Parkway.

148
00:15:13,647 --> 00:15:34,478
And one of the real focal points of this project from the beginning has been to create a building that not only really supports, as Quinlan had mentioned, the development program here that will enrich the community, but also really make sure that we're providing an active, usable, and meaningful public realm edge along Mystic Valley Parkway.

149
00:15:35,522 --> 00:15:40,485
As far as traffic goes, there's a transportation impact study that's currently under review.

150
00:15:40,966 --> 00:15:42,287
We just wanted to highlight that.

151
00:15:42,327 --> 00:15:44,888
The team has already responded to initial comments.

152
00:15:45,649 --> 00:15:55,296
We do anticipate that the project will have limited impact on area roadways with approximately 239 net new vehicle trips during the morning peak hour, 112 during the evening peak hour,

153
00:15:59,142 --> 00:16:06,467
The graphic on the right indicates our property in yellow and the intersections and key traffic areas that were studied.

154
00:16:07,028 --> 00:16:16,394
We are providing, and I'll get into a little more detail on this in a moment, approximately 422 parking spaces on site to support the demand from the new building.

155
00:16:17,215 --> 00:16:21,718
We do have traffic engineers as well that are available for questions after.

156
00:16:22,955 --> 00:16:29,080
As far as site circulation, this is, again, the same diagram, Mystic Valley Parkway on the left.

157
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,441
North is off to the right.

158
00:16:30,982 --> 00:16:33,224
Plan North above us is West.

159
00:16:34,044 --> 00:16:37,727
What we're trying to do here is just illustrate how the building sits on the site.

160
00:16:38,088 --> 00:16:42,071
You heard Mike talk a bit about the plaza and the landscaped edge.

161
00:16:42,571 --> 00:16:48,997
We've spent quite a bit of time thinking about how people, vehicles, bicycles, loading, service,

162
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:51,032
all utilize the site.

163
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:58,159
There's a one-way loop that enters on the bottom on the east side, runs around the building, and exits along the top of the page.

164
00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:02,403
This loop does maintain and narrow existing curb cuts on the site.

165
00:17:03,024 --> 00:17:10,151
Simplification of this pattern really reinforces a clean traffic flow, minimizes congestion and overlap.

166
00:17:10,292 --> 00:17:11,473
As you come into the site,

167
00:17:12,057 --> 00:17:13,879
along the east road on the bottom.

168
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:21,608
You have a bike storage area for the users of the building in the sort of reddish color right here.

169
00:17:21,668 --> 00:17:26,673
So you would have a clean path off the main Mystic Valley Parkway right in there.

170
00:17:27,194 --> 00:17:32,800
You have a loading area immediately following so trucks could come in and back into a covered protected

171
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:39,006
off the off the road sort of loading and service as you continue around the back of the building.

172
00:17:39,427 --> 00:17:45,712
This is your access point for vehicles going to the parking levels below the building for people using.

173
00:17:45,832 --> 00:17:49,536
And then, as I mentioned, sort of a right turnout onto Mystic Valley Parkway.

174
00:17:50,537 --> 00:17:53,880
Loading dock and trash room are fully enclosed.

175
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,802
Bike parking is internal.

176
00:17:56,202 --> 00:17:59,425
And one of the things I'd like to point out here, we'll talk a little bit more later, but

177
00:17:59,818 --> 00:18:05,040
The building is really designed around this idea of a public plaza on Mystic Valley.

178
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:25,788
And one of the things that we did that I think is very deliberate and quite important is pulled this sort of retail cafe piece out to really create direct frontage to the street and pulled the building lobby back a little bit away from the street to allow this plaza to exist and create better visibility for the retail and potential cafe at that front leading edge.

179
00:18:26,912 --> 00:18:30,175
Overall, from a development standpoint, a lot of data on here.

180
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:33,337
I'm not going to go through it in brutal detail at the high level.

181
00:18:33,918 --> 00:18:42,825
We have a gross building area above grade of a little over 300,000 square feet, a gross floor area of a little under 260,000 square feet.

182
00:18:42,885 --> 00:18:46,989
The difference between those is removing building support, shafts, and parking.

183
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:49,371
So that's the gross available floor area.

184
00:18:50,031 --> 00:18:55,956
And as I had mentioned, we have 422 parking spaces in three levels that are all subgrade.

185
00:18:56,735 --> 00:19:04,780
so that the parking is not visible from the public realm and accommodates what we believe to be an appropriate amount of spaces for the building use.

186
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,282
I'm going to take you through the floor plans fairly quickly.

187
00:19:08,302 --> 00:19:12,785
I wanted to start with this section just to make sure everyone understood how this building comes together.

188
00:19:13,805 --> 00:19:21,890
At the ground floor level right here, we have Mystic Valley Parkway on the left-hand side, the wetlands over here and back of house services to the right.

189
00:19:22,401 --> 00:19:25,022
we have three floors of parking below grade.

190
00:19:25,082 --> 00:19:30,584
So you can see these three levels going down into the ground, and then the building is eight floors moving up.

191
00:19:30,864 --> 00:19:39,668
And then above that eighth floor, we have a mechanical penthouse that's approximately 40 feet in height, which is really critical for these lab uses.

192
00:19:40,268 --> 00:19:44,589
So we're gonna start with this ground floor, then we're gonna go down, and then we're gonna go up.

193
00:19:44,669 --> 00:19:47,110
I'm trying to orient this thing so it really makes sense.

194
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:51,432
So again, ground floor plan circulation path around the edge,

195
00:19:51,888 --> 00:19:54,290
We talked a lot about what's in here already.

196
00:19:54,471 --> 00:19:58,394
I think this is really just a graphic to kind of reinforce what we've been talking about.

197
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:09,185
It was a very deliberate move to include loading service functions deep within the building, which really optimizes their ability to serve the building and screens them from public view.

198
00:20:09,785 --> 00:20:16,832
Loading dock is canted backwards at an angle so that the bike room and the bike storage helps to hide and screen that from Mystic Valley.

199
00:20:17,403 --> 00:20:29,687
and then really front load the entire site with very public, transparent, and visible functionality so that we are supporting in the most generous way possible the sort of small amount of frontage that we do have.

200
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:34,169
What we hope we're doing is really setting the tone for future development along this corridor.

201
00:20:34,649 --> 00:20:39,371
All of the back of house functions are back here in the darker gray on the right hand side of the image.

202
00:20:39,411 --> 00:20:43,812
And as I had mentioned, the ramp down in this location to parking levels below.

203
00:20:43,832 --> 00:20:45,833
So we're going to go below right now

204
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,921
Not going to spend a ton of time on these.

205
00:20:47,961 --> 00:20:49,843
These are a little bit more technical drawings.

206
00:20:49,883 --> 00:20:52,085
This is the third level below grade.

207
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:58,210
So if you go all the way down below the building, the cores from the lab building come all the way down here.

208
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,381
mechanical spaces in the corners.

209
00:21:00,401 --> 00:21:12,549
We have about 153 spaces on this level, 153 spaces on the second floor, and then the first floor under that ground level we had talked about has another 113 spaces.

210
00:21:12,569 --> 00:21:24,756
So there's sort of a little bit of a detailed calculation in the lower right about all the different types of spaces, including accessible and a few surface spaces for a total onsite of 422 parking.

211
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:34,164
As we go up in the building, we notice very quickly that the typical floor plan is quite different than the parking levels that are below grade.

212
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:45,672
We spent a lot of time not only thinking about the public realm, but about how to create a building envelope here that feels engaging from different sides, and it feels like it's not just a big block.

213
00:21:45,712 --> 00:21:49,114
And so you'll notice the sort of sawtooth configuration along the bottom.

214
00:21:49,895 --> 00:21:51,315
That's really facing east.

215
00:21:51,396 --> 00:21:54,377
So as you're driving down Mystic Valley Parkway towards Route 93,

216
00:21:55,508 --> 00:22:00,190
You get this sort of sense of layers to the building and you don't have just an uninterrupted wall.

217
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,070
They do wrap around the backside.

218
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:12,154
So you'll again see those corners from further away and the large notch on the front of the building really reinforcing this public plaza that is effectively the centerpiece of this project.

219
00:22:12,874 --> 00:22:19,557
We have two quick typical optional floor layouts we wanted to share just so everyone could understand how this building works.

220
00:22:19,737 --> 00:22:23,398
In gray are these cores that came down into the garage coming up here.

221
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:26,338
elevator, stair tower, service areas.

222
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:37,326
At the highest level, everything that's kind of greenish is really lab, whether it's support space for the lab, specialty lab areas, or the lighter green is sort of the open lab space.

223
00:22:37,466 --> 00:22:41,609
And everything that's in blue or light blue are really office functionality.

224
00:22:41,649 --> 00:22:46,192
So there's office plan, open plan office, there's some enclosed offices.

225
00:22:46,252 --> 00:22:49,675
And then up on the front left hand side of this image here, we have

226
00:22:50,477 --> 00:23:01,583
break areas at each level that really will create very glassy, transparent, and connected internal spaces that overlook onto the plaza, as well as conference rooms in purple.

227
00:23:02,424 --> 00:23:03,525
This is another layout.

228
00:23:03,565 --> 00:23:08,487
This one's sort of a little bit different where the lab is really bifurcated to the right-hand side of the building.

229
00:23:09,028 --> 00:23:11,429
Office functionality lays out towards the front.

230
00:23:11,789 --> 00:23:14,871
I think there's still a number of configurations we're contemplating here.

231
00:23:14,911 --> 00:23:16,512
I think the idea is we've developed

232
00:23:17,074 --> 00:23:23,918
a building structure and a building footprint that really is quite flexible and will allow us to really serve a wide range of lab needs.

233
00:23:24,939 --> 00:23:30,302
As we go up a little further, this is a quick plan outline of the mechanical penthouse floor that I had mentioned earlier.

234
00:23:30,862 --> 00:23:36,605
One important note here is the building outline in red is the volume of the building we've been talking about below.

235
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:44,690
You can see the mechanical penthouse has its own very unique structure and form in some areas on the bottom, sort of echoing the sawtooth.

236
00:23:45,552 --> 00:23:48,815
and then on other areas sort of creating slightly different geometries.

237
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:56,401
This is set back from the edge of the building below, again, to really make sure that we're breaking down the scale and mass of this as much as possible.

238
00:23:57,502 --> 00:23:58,282
Here's a quick image.

239
00:23:58,302 --> 00:24:04,947
We're sort of looking, Mystic Valley Parkway, we're looking sort of, I guess, in the westerly direction here.

240
00:24:04,987 --> 00:24:10,692
So down in the lower areas, you see this sort of very generous plaza that we're creating out in the front.

241
00:24:11,132 --> 00:24:16,834
This would be the retail cafe location here coming out and having a more direct engagement with the street.

242
00:24:17,294 --> 00:24:20,915
These are the break areas over here, looking down over that plaza.

243
00:24:21,435 --> 00:24:26,377
Main entry to the building for users and occupiers would be kind of in this area.

244
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:33,659
And then you have that buffer and sort of the continuation of the green tree zone along the edge of the street.

245
00:24:34,019 --> 00:24:38,701
This is the road that exits out onto Mystic Valley, and this is sort of the entry road over here.

246
00:24:39,364 --> 00:24:43,066
The building design itself is quite glassy and quite transparent.

247
00:24:43,166 --> 00:25:00,354
One of the things that you can see here is sort of, we've taken this 40 foot high penthouse volume and really broken that down into two separate layers, where the first layer, which is about 15 feet, really has direct engagement with the building so that the glassy areas kind of feel like they're engaged in that.

248
00:25:00,454 --> 00:25:05,697
And it has the resulting impact of really reducing the feel of the penthouse up above.

249
00:25:07,077 --> 00:25:08,778
From a building material standpoint,

250
00:25:09,505 --> 00:25:19,247
We have sort of a mix of glass, transparent building edges, wrapping corners, projecting with gentle overhangs that you see here on the east side.

251
00:25:19,647 --> 00:25:26,548
And we're looking at a mix of sort of a number of different lighter to darker smooth gray metal panels.

252
00:25:27,008 --> 00:25:33,889
We have a white metal panel that appears in sort of all the glassy building facades where we have composite windows in some storefront.

253
00:25:34,769 --> 00:25:38,510
And then we have in this lighter gray area here coming down,

254
00:25:39,094 --> 00:25:48,181
and intersecting with the base of the building, we're proposing a more textured metal panel to pick up a little more shadow and a little bit more of a connection at that pedestrian scale.

255
00:25:48,741 --> 00:25:50,923
And these are just a quick series of elevations.

256
00:25:50,983 --> 00:25:53,685
This is facing the Mystic Valley Parkway edge.

257
00:25:54,506 --> 00:26:05,654
And you can see the glass down here and then the rest of the glass up here and some of this metal panel coming down and really creating that strong break where we have that volume that comes out towards Mystic Valley Parkway.

258
00:26:06,095 --> 00:26:06,615
Oops, sorry.

259
00:26:07,322 --> 00:26:10,483
This is the long face on the west side.

260
00:26:10,583 --> 00:26:21,426
So right in this area right here is where we have that plaza, Mystic Valley Parkway is over here to the right, and that really large glass area kind of fronting directly down onto that plaza.

261
00:26:22,427 --> 00:26:25,368
This is the rear of the building, a little more solid here.

262
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:32,750
So you would come around the backside, and if you're a vehicle that works here, you would sort of enter the right-hand edge of the building to go down below.

263
00:26:33,617 --> 00:26:38,960
and then the other side, this is the eastern side, so facing traffic on Mystic Valley Parkway.

264
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:45,364
And you can probably see there's quite a bit more sort of direct engagement of the building edge here as it develops.

265
00:26:45,384 --> 00:26:58,712
So we're creating shadow lines, we're creating these sort of sawtooth pieces that really reach down, overhang the building, create some beautiful shadow edges and really give you a sense of depth and layering to the building itself and then the penthouse above.

266
00:26:59,992 --> 00:27:02,494
From a shadow study standpoint, we ran a fairly

267
00:27:03,435 --> 00:27:08,677
standard array of shadow studies for the equinoxes, the summer solstice, and the winter solstice.

268
00:27:08,737 --> 00:27:12,758
This is nine, noon, and three o'clock during each of those times.

269
00:27:13,538 --> 00:27:16,139
We're happy to spend a lot more time on this whenever you want.

270
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:27,503
I think the high level takeaway here is that really none of the buildings to the east, Century Ford, or the communication building are seeing any additional shadow impacts.

271
00:27:27,603 --> 00:27:28,083
We are

272
00:27:29,135 --> 00:27:35,141
In the early morning, we do have an impact on Mystic Valley Parkway in all three of these different conditions.

273
00:27:36,142 --> 00:27:41,347
That's gone in all three conditions by noon, and it's also gone in the afternoon.

274
00:27:41,467 --> 00:27:48,454
So we do feel like the shadow impacts of this building on Mystic Valley Parkway and that developing public realm are fairly de minimis.

275
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:54,410
And then just one final quick image of the building, and then I'd like to turn it back over to Quinlan.

276
00:27:55,271 --> 00:27:58,993
And then we're certainly happy to answer and address any and all questions you may have.

277
00:28:02,075 --> 00:28:02,635
Thanks, Brian.

278
00:28:02,675 --> 00:28:08,539
And with that, I won't spend too much time, but I just wanted to say again, thank you so much for the time this evening.

279
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:13,162
We have our full team on deck here for any questions that anybody has here.

280
00:28:13,944 --> 00:28:19,930
Um, Mr Chair, members of the board really appreciate your time and looking forward to working with the city of Medford on this project.

281
00:28:20,731 --> 00:28:21,392
Thank you so much.

282
00:28:23,414 --> 00:28:23,574
Right.

283
00:28:23,614 --> 00:28:24,735
Thank you for the presentation.

284
00:28:24,755 --> 00:28:32,663
Uh, we, uh, stop the sharing right now.

285
00:28:37,231 --> 00:28:51,077
I know that the Office of Community Development has been doing quite a bit of work, so I would invite, not to put you on the spot, Victor, or anybody else, but I would invite you, before we get to the board member comments, if you want to say a few words.

286
00:28:54,996 --> 00:28:57,057
Sure, thank you, Andre and the board.

287
00:28:58,358 --> 00:28:59,639
And thanks to the RISE team.

288
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:01,080
They've been good to work with.

289
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:06,644
And we're looking forward to a robust discussion tonight about this project.

290
00:29:06,704 --> 00:29:22,874
I think there's a nice opportunity over in the Wellington area to bring that district into modern times and really help it function better for the city of Medford, both from an economic standpoint, but also from a livability standpoint.

291
00:29:24,848 --> 00:29:35,392
Talking to people about Wellington, no one seems to spend a lot of time in that area, except for those few people that live over there.

292
00:29:35,452 --> 00:29:36,312
So it's growing.

293
00:29:36,953 --> 00:29:38,893
We're hoping to improve it with every project.

294
00:29:38,973 --> 00:29:41,574
And we think that this project does.

295
00:29:42,215 --> 00:29:44,695
But certainly look forward to your input.

296
00:29:44,776 --> 00:29:48,457
And I know that the RISE team will respond.

297
00:29:53,362 --> 00:29:57,765
I assume you've received the comment letters from all the city department heads.

298
00:30:00,827 --> 00:30:02,588
Has your team had a chance to review them?

299
00:30:02,608 --> 00:30:12,494
Apologies, I couldn't find the unmute button.

300
00:30:12,554 --> 00:30:15,716
Yes, we did receive the comment letters from the city departments.

301
00:30:16,497 --> 00:30:18,418
We have been thoroughly reviewing them.

302
00:30:19,158 --> 00:30:21,560
There is a lot of great information in there that

303
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,142
we're hoping to incorporate into this project.

304
00:30:24,302 --> 00:30:27,924
A lot of things that we've already started to incorporate into the project as well.

305
00:30:28,004 --> 00:30:33,689
So again, we did receive those comment letters and we appreciate everybody following up with those.

306
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:39,133
Is there anything in any of those letters that you think would be problematic?

307
00:30:40,033 --> 00:30:44,757
Do you think that you'd be able to meet those requests?

308
00:30:45,892 --> 00:30:47,594
Yeah, nothing so far.

309
00:30:48,294 --> 00:30:53,339
You know, we've had our whole project team reviewing those letters and nothing problematic has come up to date.

310
00:30:54,040 --> 00:31:00,265
I think, you know, and working with the city departments and working with the state departments will also be reviewing this project.

311
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:04,069
I think there's a lot of good benefits in those comment letters that we could start working through.

312
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:15,301
A lot of them do require a little bit of studying and feasibility, but I think with the attention that this team has put together and all the thoughts from the city, I think we can get there.

313
00:31:15,381 --> 00:31:17,583
So nothing problematic that we've seen today.

314
00:31:20,105 --> 00:31:20,486
Thank you.

315
00:31:21,927 --> 00:31:26,712
Let me open up to questions from board members.

316
00:31:27,513 --> 00:31:28,634
Yes, Klaus Andresen.

317
00:31:30,543 --> 00:31:42,491
can I start by asking for a little more information about the process that this project is going through?

318
00:31:43,712 --> 00:31:48,755
Most specifically, I noticed that there's a number of variances being requested.

319
00:31:48,795 --> 00:31:49,996
What is the status of that?

320
00:31:51,156 --> 00:31:58,761
And if you can talk a little bit about when that will go to the ZBA.

321
00:32:00,905 --> 00:32:08,707
And also, can you talk a little bit about sustainability and resiliency goals for the project before I ask any questions?

322
00:32:09,408 --> 00:32:09,748
Thank you.

323
00:32:11,968 --> 00:32:12,309
Sure.

324
00:32:12,429 --> 00:32:19,631
So I think the first question for the zoning purposes, I believe we have Dean Torbey on here, who is the zoning attorney on the project.

325
00:32:19,711 --> 00:32:21,551
So I'll turn it over to them.

326
00:32:21,611 --> 00:32:27,793
And we also have our permitting agency, VHB, on the project in case they want to touch on anything as well.

327
00:32:27,813 --> 00:32:30,394
But Michael, I think you're on if you want to touch on some of that.

328
00:32:31,307 --> 00:32:31,547
Great.

329
00:32:31,607 --> 00:32:32,168
Thank you, Quinn.

330
00:32:32,568 --> 00:32:32,908
Thank you.

331
00:32:33,289 --> 00:32:42,416
So as far as the zoning board process, we filed an application for the variances that you've seen here tonight on April 13th.

332
00:32:43,256 --> 00:32:53,805
And so it's our understanding that we will get a public hearing with the ZBA after they receive recommendations from the Community Development Board.

333
00:32:54,225 --> 00:32:56,667
So we're in the process, we're just waiting.

334
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:03,984
If I might just follow up on that, because I know members are more familiar with this.

335
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:13,631
So it is scheduled at the ZBA on May 26, but there is no pressure to close this in order to make that date.

336
00:33:14,852 --> 00:33:26,841
The proponent has been advised, this is what they're commenting on, and I discussed with the staff, Dennis, this evening, that if this board does not issue conditions tonight,

337
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:37,523
then they will just open and continue that hearing and the ZBA will not actually hear this until this board is done with the site plan review.

338
00:33:38,223 --> 00:33:46,886
But they did file in a timely manner such that if you were to choose to finish this evening, they could be heard on the 26th.

339
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:48,746
Great, thank you.

340
00:33:52,088 --> 00:33:56,909
Can I ask that you just walk through the different variances that you're requesting?

341
00:33:57,970 --> 00:33:58,230
Sure.

342
00:33:58,631 --> 00:34:04,114
So we have a side yard of variants that we're looking for for five feet.

343
00:34:05,095 --> 00:34:08,697
One rear yard, well, rear yard variants of five feet.

344
00:34:10,058 --> 00:34:13,140
Lock coverage, we're looking at lock coverage of 57% versus 50%.

345
00:34:17,003 --> 00:34:20,705
So looking for a variance of approximately 7% in the lot coverage.

346
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:23,746
Height looks like 135 feet.

347
00:34:24,387 --> 00:34:25,707
Variance that we'd be looking for.

348
00:34:25,727 --> 00:34:30,170
As far as stories, six stories we'd be looking for for relief.

349
00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:33,391
We're in a two and we're looking at eight stories here.

350
00:34:33,892 --> 00:34:35,292
And then loading bays.

351
00:34:36,193 --> 00:34:40,195
We are required to have five loading bays.

352
00:34:40,235 --> 00:34:41,696
We've determined we only need three.

353
00:34:42,576 --> 00:34:46,458
So we'd be looking for a variance of decreasing that by two loading bays.

354
00:34:50,026 --> 00:34:50,466
And that's it.

355
00:34:52,708 --> 00:34:55,390
Can you also speak to the sustainability things?

356
00:34:55,710 --> 00:35:08,779
There's stuff that's in here, but I feel that when you met with our office, you talked more about your commitment to sustainability and that type of thing that was part of Klaus's question.

357
00:35:10,037 --> 00:35:10,697
Yeah, absolutely.

358
00:35:10,717 --> 00:35:16,980
I think we do have Stephanie Krul on here from VHB who's helping us on the environmental and permitting side of things.

359
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:23,763
And we also have Jacob's engineering on here who has helped us through a few of the sustainability goals early on.

360
00:35:23,903 --> 00:35:28,485
So feel free to unmute yourselves if you want to speak on that.

361
00:35:28,886 --> 00:35:29,206
Thank you.

362
00:35:31,707 --> 00:35:33,468
Hi, this is Stephanie Krul from VHB.

363
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:40,233
I can speak a little bit more to the climate change and mitigation side than to the sustainability side.

364
00:35:40,873 --> 00:35:42,774
But this project is subject to MEPA.

365
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:46,936
We filed an ENF and got a certificate April 1st.

366
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:52,078
We've been invited to file a single environmental impact report.

367
00:35:52,999 --> 00:36:02,543
And so we have been utilizing the data at the state level, the most up-to-date information about climate change impacts

368
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:05,221
heat sea level rise precipitation.

369
00:36:06,923 --> 00:36:17,977
Really, this site is most vulnerable to flooding due to sea level rise, and that's because of its location in the vicinity of a wetland area.

370
00:36:20,456 --> 00:36:37,182
The project is looking to raise the first floor and to have some passive and active flood proofing measures in place in the event that there is flooding on the site, or also anticipating that the.

371
00:36:39,003 --> 00:36:48,833
District scale flood protection measures that are a little bit further downstream are going to be erected and they'll provide a lot of protection to the site.

372
00:36:49,234 --> 00:36:54,098
So in the end, it might not in fact be vulnerable to as much flooding as it first appears.

373
00:36:54,839 --> 00:37:00,485
So that's the that's the flooding side and I'll turn it over to the design team to talk more about sustainability.

374
00:37:04,831 --> 00:37:10,656
Yeah, I believe we have Jacobs on here who could talk a little bit through some of the sustainability goals we've started to create for the project.

375
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:13,598
Yes, I'm Stephan Churis, I'm with Jacobs.

376
00:37:14,358 --> 00:37:27,068
And we are early in the design phase and we are looking to target lead gold, essentially for the project.

377
00:37:27,969 --> 00:37:31,992
We are looking at issues including heat island reduction,

378
00:37:33,213 --> 00:37:48,384
increase energy efficiency and performance, efficient use of plumbing fixtures, lighting controls, increased energy efficiency for equipment and anything in the building, environmental air quality.

379
00:37:49,305 --> 00:37:53,669
low emitting materials, you know, most of the issues that we target for LEED.

380
00:37:54,810 --> 00:38:09,583
And so again, stressing that we are in the early phases of design, but, you know, we will work to develop our LEED scorecard and, you know, work with the city as we work through our process all together.

381
00:38:17,647 --> 00:38:18,007
Thank you.

382
00:38:18,507 --> 00:38:19,928
Class did you have a follow up question.

383
00:38:19,948 --> 00:38:21,529
I have a ton.

384
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:24,970
I'm not surprised.

385
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:28,412
Yeah.

386
00:38:31,413 --> 00:38:40,817
I don't know if I should just hammer these all off, and then you guys can try to go through them or should do them one by one I don't know what's easiest, but I'm Andre David.

387
00:38:41,747 --> 00:38:42,708
And I'm sorry to interrupt.

388
00:38:42,908 --> 00:38:48,432
Can I ask more of a bigger picture, more along the lines of what Clay's just asked?

389
00:38:48,813 --> 00:38:53,676
If he's about to ask a lot of detailed questions, can I ask one more conceptual?

390
00:38:55,818 --> 00:38:56,398
Yeah, go ahead.

391
00:38:56,519 --> 00:38:56,859
Let's see.

392
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:57,619
Clay's nodded.

393
00:38:57,639 --> 00:38:59,501
OK, thank you.

394
00:39:02,363 --> 00:39:04,405
I guess I'm.

395
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:31,378
This seems like the perfect opportunity to take advantage of some of the tools that we have in our newly minted zoning ordinance for instance a plan commercial development district to try to really put some thorough thinking into what to do with this area that probably is right for development, running from mall to mall along the parkway, has the city thought through that.

396
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:39,053
We have very few pockets where we have this potential for development.

397
00:39:39,653 --> 00:39:42,374
We're in the process of the comprehensive plan.

398
00:39:42,974 --> 00:39:45,536
We've just gone through the zoning update.

399
00:39:46,456 --> 00:39:57,001
And here we are with sort of a one off one parcel development that very much exceeds our zoning limitations.

400
00:39:58,182 --> 00:40:00,783
And I would feel a lot better about what's being

401
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:09,376
of a comprehensive view of that neighborhood to see what is the vision for this going forward?

402
00:40:12,518 --> 00:40:12,959
Thank you, David.

403
00:40:12,979 --> 00:40:14,940
That might be a question for Alicia.

404
00:40:16,161 --> 00:40:19,104
And I was going to say that was actually one of my questions also.

405
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:28,952
It does seem like this is another one of those island projects where the bigger picture here, which if thought about beforehand, could be

406
00:40:30,013 --> 00:40:36,477
much more rich than just this single project alone.

407
00:40:36,497 --> 00:40:40,839
So I'll start by saying that this is something we're absolutely talking about.

408
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,480
We're looking at this area.

409
00:40:42,821 --> 00:40:46,843
There's the Wellington Circle transportation traffic study that's going on.

410
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:48,504
That's the proponents alluded to that.

411
00:40:50,065 --> 00:40:55,008
We have actually applied for a grant to look at this area overall.

412
00:40:55,768 --> 00:40:58,329
Um, and I may ask Victor to speak a little bit more to that.

413
00:40:58,829 --> 00:41:07,070
But along those lines, this project actually fits everything we've heard so far from the comprehensive plan.

414
00:41:07,511 --> 00:41:11,491
This is what has sort of been percolating about this area.

415
00:41:11,731 --> 00:41:13,912
Is that a life science area?

416
00:41:14,352 --> 00:41:18,853
And part of our thoughts is that this building might serve as a proof of concept for that.

417
00:41:20,574 --> 00:41:33,840
specifically about planned development districts, we are talking to some developers who are definitely looking to pursue that in specific locations in the city, but it has to come from the developer, not from the city, right?

418
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:41,004
Like if the developer says, I'd rather use this process or that process, that's their discretion.

419
00:41:41,104 --> 00:41:43,365
We don't create a planned development district.

420
00:41:43,425 --> 00:41:44,266
We never would.

421
00:41:44,606 --> 00:41:46,867
It would always come from a private developer.

422
00:41:47,267 --> 00:41:48,628
We might encourage it.

423
00:41:49,728 --> 00:41:59,514
But I think Victor is actually the lead on that grant that I mentioned, and so I'd like to actually just see if Vic wants to add a little bit more to what I just said.

424
00:41:59,554 --> 00:42:00,835
I hope I didn't overstep.

425
00:42:03,885 --> 00:42:04,785
No, not at all.

426
00:42:04,805 --> 00:42:05,906
That's right on.

427
00:42:06,206 --> 00:42:08,847
And you're right.

428
00:42:09,227 --> 00:42:13,449
This project is a little bit ahead of the planning we have on the ground.

429
00:42:13,549 --> 00:42:16,310
But it's definitely in line with what we're hearing.

430
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:25,493
And we're trying to leverage the comprehensive plan as best we can as we're going through that process and make sure the projects are lining up.

431
00:42:25,554 --> 00:42:29,035
These are, as you all know, private initiatives.

432
00:42:29,155 --> 00:42:31,436
And this project has been in the works for,

433
00:42:32,358 --> 00:42:34,639
for about a year to the day now.

434
00:42:34,759 --> 00:42:42,244
So when it was being conceived, the new zoning was out there, but had a long way to go.

435
00:42:42,264 --> 00:42:46,186
It preempted the new zoning a little bit.

436
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:59,632
We're hoping to catch up with planning and see the opportunity that, David, I think you're alluding to in place.

437
00:42:59,712 --> 00:43:03,154
And I think everyone has in their mind as to what this area could be.

438
00:43:03,194 --> 00:43:13,877
There's quite a bit of property that's on the market in the Wellington area that's pretty closely, if not adjacent to this parcel.

439
00:43:14,157 --> 00:43:20,319
And so there's planning that should be done.

440
00:43:20,379 --> 00:43:21,700
And I think there's a bigger vision that

441
00:43:22,584 --> 00:43:25,106
that should be established.

442
00:43:25,206 --> 00:43:35,692
But at this point, we're based on community feedback through the comprehensive plan and the process this project has gone through in terms of getting community feedback.

443
00:43:35,752 --> 00:43:40,455
It's been overall positive and encouraging.

444
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:44,437
And folks are excited to see a new industry come to Medford.

445
00:43:46,464 --> 00:44:05,522
And, you know, now we're in the detail stages of the building, but in terms of the overall vision, we hope to get there soon and certainly think that this project will tie in once we do, but not as far as we can offer on that right now.

446
00:44:05,542 --> 00:44:07,064
I just want to make sure I'm understanding.

447
00:44:07,084 --> 00:44:11,528
So the grant that the city is applying for would be for a district

448
00:44:12,345 --> 00:44:16,566
to develop a district plan around well, or what I see?

449
00:44:16,586 --> 00:44:17,566
I'm sorry, yes.

450
00:44:17,987 --> 00:44:34,271
Yeah, it would be, it's over 90 acres that it would cover of the greater Wellington area, including Sycamore Ave, which this board has heard a project on Sycamore Ave recently.

451
00:44:35,191 --> 00:44:39,293
And then also an area over by the Wellington,

452
00:44:40,693 --> 00:44:45,799
MBTA station that the city has the air rights for so we feel like it's all connected.

453
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:58,653
And it would be that would be the study area would be an economic development study thinking about growth phasing, but layering in, you know, amenities.

454
00:45:00,254 --> 00:45:00,415
The

455
00:45:02,143 --> 00:45:16,251
potentially new roadway systems or things that needed to be developed in, along with new growth to accommodate it, both at grade and below grade and yeah.

456
00:45:16,331 --> 00:45:26,537
One thing I want to just build on that is I don't want to incorrectly use the term plan development, because it's now an official thing in our zoning.

457
00:45:28,593 --> 00:45:32,174
The studies and economic sorry my video keeps freezing.

458
00:45:33,215 --> 00:45:37,196
The studies and economic development study looking at the whole area.

459
00:45:37,896 --> 00:45:47,940
If it would then individual developers might choose to use the tool plan development district to propose stuff on one or more properties.

460
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:50,161
That's why I was just shaking my head.

461
00:45:50,181 --> 00:45:54,225
I don't want to get us tangled up in those by accident.

462
00:45:55,686 --> 00:45:57,187
And so that's a piece of it.

463
00:45:57,508 --> 00:46:03,093
And something that Victor alluded to, I just wanted to mention, I realized that nobody had actually called this out.

464
00:46:04,454 --> 00:46:13,662
Mayor Brianna has been very enthusiastic about having public meetings about various projects before they file with boards and commissions.

465
00:46:14,122 --> 00:46:24,150
she wants, before we engage too too deeply as a city with them, she wants to see what the public reaction is to various projects.

466
00:46:24,711 --> 00:46:33,378
And so what Victor was alluding to in the public feedback on this is that there was a public meeting and somebody who is more sharp than I am this evening

467
00:46:33,778 --> 00:46:37,180
We'll need to say when that occurred, but there was a public meeting.

468
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,981
I think a few of you were on there.

469
00:46:39,502 --> 00:46:40,642
It got good feedback.

470
00:46:40,983 --> 00:46:43,884
That was part of what fed into the comprehensive plan.

471
00:46:44,044 --> 00:46:48,087
And at the last comprehensive plan meeting, we then

472
00:46:48,608 --> 00:46:53,269
broke out into the public meeting, we broke out into groups to look at different areas.

473
00:46:53,709 --> 00:46:57,730
And we asked residents for feedback on this area as well as other areas.

474
00:46:58,211 --> 00:47:03,112
And what we heard from the public was life sciences make sense here.

475
00:47:03,212 --> 00:47:10,074
Some higher buildings, some little more density, these commercial buildings, good jobs in Medford make sense along here.

476
00:47:10,894 --> 00:47:35,381
Um, so that's where we do feel like we're getting out in front of the comprehensive plan but in a good way because these buildings take time to build and life sciences are hot now and we'd like them to come to Medford and not go to, you know, Charlestown or let's not Watertown or, you know, we or hopscotch us out further out of the city but to to come here to Medford.

477
00:47:35,601 --> 00:47:38,582
That's part of why we've encouraged them to

478
00:47:39,107 --> 00:47:43,589
continue with the process now and not just wait until the comprehensive plan is done.

479
00:47:45,249 --> 00:47:45,650
Thank you.

480
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:51,492
Just, I guess, to respond to what member Bloomberg had had asked.

481
00:47:52,052 --> 00:48:06,378
So the grant that is being referenced here by the city should the city get it, which is not a done deal, it would be for an economic development plan, not for a district plan that would, you know, address things like design guidelines.

482
00:48:10,734 --> 00:48:12,275
It wouldn't be that specific, Andre.

483
00:48:12,295 --> 00:48:13,995
That's not how we've written it.

484
00:48:14,275 --> 00:48:15,516
I think we could take it.

485
00:48:16,436 --> 00:48:18,436
That would be a phase two type project.

486
00:48:18,456 --> 00:48:21,157
It would be more design related.

487
00:48:21,658 --> 00:48:22,358
It's higher level.

488
00:48:25,339 --> 00:48:25,719
Thank you.

489
00:48:26,419 --> 00:48:32,321
Going back to class, would you like to dig into some of your questions?

490
00:48:33,121 --> 00:48:35,922
Yeah, I think that's a great overview, and thank you.

491
00:48:35,942 --> 00:48:38,563
I mean, I think it really helps for us to hear

492
00:48:40,486 --> 00:48:44,309
you know, what members of the community are thinking.

493
00:48:47,331 --> 00:48:54,537
I certainly agree that, you know, more development and more jobs and all that is a good thing here.

494
00:48:59,941 --> 00:49:03,944
At the beginning of the presentation, you talked a little bit about a retaining wall around the site.

495
00:49:05,044 --> 00:49:08,287
I was wondering if you could give maybe just a little more detail on that.

496
00:49:12,606 --> 00:49:21,868
And I guess maybe parallel to that, you also talked about sort of a fence around the site.

497
00:49:22,428 --> 00:49:39,991
You know, when when Dave, David mentioned, you know, this, and I said, use the word island to think about or to describe the way it sort of feels that at least at this point, I think maybe part of that is the fear that this will just be like,

498
00:49:41,757 --> 00:50:00,458
one thing that just sort of except for the, the two, you know, driveways at the front of the site is completely cordoned off and has no sort of maybe not, you know, physical porosity but maybe visual porosity through, you know, and I know there's a big wall on the

499
00:50:02,467 --> 00:50:18,917
on the court next door, but you know there is a wetland behind it, so I'm sort of wondering, you know, how, how you're sort of using the nature around you to sort of connect through the site and make it more than just, you know, a six foot tall white plastic fence.

500
00:50:22,586 --> 00:50:24,927
I appreciate the renderings.

501
00:50:25,087 --> 00:50:49,214
I think what would be great is if you could do some renderings of what the building will look like from where we'll see it, namely, along the parkway from McDonald Park, maybe most importantly, so that, you know, us and maybe more importantly, members of town can see what this is going to look like, you know, when when they're interacting with it.

502
00:50:51,583 --> 00:50:57,126
As far as design I don't I don't want to say too much, but I think the designs is

503
00:50:58,590 --> 00:50:59,951
starting off in a nice way.

504
00:50:59,971 --> 00:51:03,133
I like the way Brian talked about sawtooths.

505
00:51:04,414 --> 00:51:12,480
I might encourage that you keep going with that, because I think that's a nice move that helps to break down the scale.

506
00:51:13,061 --> 00:51:14,842
I noticed there weren't any on the west side.

507
00:51:14,862 --> 00:51:17,044
I don't know if that's something that you could bring in.

508
00:51:17,544 --> 00:51:27,672
And maybe that sort of leads into my other comment, which is about, and especially thinking about future developments and everything, thinking about where you are,

509
00:51:28,357 --> 00:51:35,479
in along this really beautiful park, thinking about context and materials.

510
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:53,064
For me, I'm totally fine with glass buildings, but I wonder if maybe slightly less glass, maybe a little less

511
00:51:55,825 --> 00:52:10,037
Um, I'm not really finding the right word, but like it seems like a very sort of glassy showy building and sort of wedge between two wetlands and along this parkway.

512
00:52:10,797 --> 00:52:20,785
Um, I wonder if maybe a little more sort of, um, opaque materials, maybe a little more masonry or things like that might be a little more appropriate.

513
00:52:21,106 --> 00:52:24,909
Um, I'm not, I'm not gonna say, you know,

514
00:52:26,158 --> 00:52:30,800
look at Medford references, because I don't think there's a whole lot, especially at that scale.

515
00:52:34,682 --> 00:52:51,351
And I think as far as the variances are concerned, that is obviously the thing that jumped out at me initially when I was looking through the materials.

516
00:52:54,495 --> 00:52:59,939
Obviously a proponent for the, for the, for the density, and for the amount of space.

517
00:53:03,861 --> 00:53:19,411
But I also wonder, you know, he's, I'm assuming these are in the 40,000 square feet footprints for these floors I'm wondering if, you know, that might be a little big for the site, I don't know.

518
00:53:23,152 --> 00:53:51,884
It does seem like these variances are, you know, they're aggressive and it may totally be warranted, but it's like something I feel like this board and maybe the others on the board that aren't an architect might benefit from a slightly better understanding of how, you know, what's driving the size

519
00:53:54,873 --> 00:53:58,875
sort of massing of this building, which is gonna be imposing, certainly in the short term.

520
00:54:02,537 --> 00:54:03,418
I could probably stop there.

521
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:10,241
I'll let the project team respond to some of those before we continue.

522
00:54:11,982 --> 00:54:14,123
Perfect, thank you, Chair, and thank you for the comments.

523
00:54:15,064 --> 00:54:18,866
I think we'll probably just start with the retaining wall and the fence surrounding the site.

524
00:54:18,906 --> 00:54:23,148
I know BHP Civil as well as MVLA are here, so if you can just touch on that.

525
00:54:25,548 --> 00:54:33,250
Well, this is Mark Anhansen, VHB, taking over for Tim because he's got a seven o'clock stop.

526
00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:37,051
We started with a plan that sort of followed the existing topography.

527
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:42,712
The site as it sits slopes away from Mystic Valley Parkway to the back.

528
00:54:43,833 --> 00:54:50,514
One of the sort of pitfalls of that is there's no actual drainage infrastructure on the site.

529
00:54:50,554 --> 00:54:53,675
Everything goes surface from the front to the back.

530
00:54:55,619 --> 00:55:16,515
And, you know, our first, you know, thought was okay we have to build it up a little bit, you know, we'll be a little high in the front and then we'll drop down to our loading dock elevation but as we began to look at the the flooding constraints and the, you know, the, the need to protect the building once again also as sort of a competing requirement.

531
00:55:17,736 --> 00:55:19,838
We pulled the building up and plateaued it.

532
00:55:20,937 --> 00:55:44,178
I think we can be a little bit more sensitive in what it looks like or how we transition it, but it's really being driven by the need to protect the building in what is now a projected flooding event, but also making sure that along Misty Valley Parkway, we preserve the pattern of stormwater that splits going to Misty Valley Parkway and to the back.

533
00:55:46,737 --> 00:55:51,600
you know we focus on our connection to the the parkway in the park across the street.

534
00:55:52,180 --> 00:56:10,569
It's just going to be very hard to connect it to the back without exposing the building so that was sort of what's driving our design now happy to talk about it and see if there are ways that we can mitigate how it connects or you know what are the town's priorities and how you'd like this to connect.

535
00:56:10,589 --> 00:56:14,371
It's a good place it's a good, it's a good comment it's, you know,

536
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:17,100
Yeah, no, I mean, bit of a challenge.

537
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:22,421
Initially, just from the presentation, I was assuming it was like a bathtub.

538
00:56:22,621 --> 00:56:32,665
So I think I feel a little bit better about the fact that it's proud of proud of the surrounding site rather than been down into it.

539
00:56:34,406 --> 00:56:44,309
But yeah, I think, you know, just being mindful, again, thinking about future development of how you're treating those, those walls and the edges there, I think that that'll be important.

540
00:56:45,257 --> 00:56:45,597
Thank you.

541
00:56:47,558 --> 00:56:51,939
And I think the next one we should probably touch on is some of the design comments.

542
00:56:51,959 --> 00:56:53,320
We appreciate those comments.

543
00:56:53,400 --> 00:57:05,344
And I think Mr. Locke, actually, before you move on to that, we do have one of the city engineers with extensive stormwater background.

544
00:57:05,424 --> 00:57:11,586
And I'm wondering if Owen might be willing to speak to his review of the project.

545
00:57:12,627 --> 00:57:12,987
Absolutely.

546
00:57:13,007 --> 00:57:13,507
Apologies, Chair.

547
00:57:15,197 --> 00:57:20,039
Hi, I'm sorry, I'm coming in late.

548
00:57:20,099 --> 00:57:24,662
I just found out that you guys wanted me on this meeting.

549
00:57:25,522 --> 00:57:30,504
My comments on the stormwater were, I understand conceptually what it is.

550
00:57:30,524 --> 00:57:44,591
I think the big takeaway here is that the board probably would be concerned about would be that the stormwater is being collected within the building and then being pumped out

551
00:57:46,399 --> 00:58:07,424
Um, and the other thing that they may be interested in is that, um, that goes to what you guys mentioned before was basically, um, the extent of the site itself kind of imposed into that 25 foot buffer area to the wetlands in the back.

552
00:58:08,844 --> 00:58:13,625
And those are the two big takeaways that have to deal with stormwater.

553
00:58:17,364 --> 00:58:25,971
Mostly because the wall is basically filling in that wetland area, that volume area.

554
00:58:28,153 --> 00:58:30,034
The adjacency, yeah.

555
00:58:31,215 --> 00:58:33,117
Not the actual wetland, I just want to be clear.

556
00:58:34,318 --> 00:58:35,639
Correct, it's not filling the wetland.

557
00:58:39,923 --> 00:59:06,089
Well, just to reinforce something I think that Cles had said about some renderings, I'd certainly love to see these elevations in a rendering so that we can really get a sense of the site, the contouring of the site and the retaining wall and the fencing and how that all works together and how it affects the abutting properties.

558
00:59:06,749 --> 00:59:09,650
That'd be something that I would definitely like to see.

559
00:59:11,063 --> 00:59:12,984
I'm can I just jump it back in for a second?

560
00:59:13,505 --> 00:59:15,906
And I think you've all heard me say this before.

561
00:59:19,489 --> 00:59:24,472
I think, you know, you've done a very nice presentation.

562
00:59:25,013 --> 00:59:26,073
We really appreciate it.

563
00:59:27,294 --> 00:59:29,996
And this is sort of my blanket comment about this process.

564
00:59:30,877 --> 00:59:38,582
It's it's sort of, it's on you to make sure that the information that we need

565
00:59:39,712 --> 00:59:41,253
is available and clear.

566
00:59:42,454 --> 01:00:00,928
So I mentioned the renderings, but I think I would ask that you think about that in a much broader way in how you present this information, because it's certainly going to go through us, but the city is going to see it as well.

567
01:00:02,189 --> 01:00:03,770
So showing us

568
01:00:04,686 --> 01:00:04,746
Um.

569
01:00:04,766 --> 01:00:11,470
Exhibits that really reinforce, um, the design and how the building is going to live on its site.

570
01:00:12,050 --> 01:00:13,251
I think are really important.

571
01:00:13,511 --> 01:00:16,753
Um I'm not suggesting that this is a necessity.

572
01:00:17,454 --> 01:00:22,457
But this is certainly the kind of area and project where a model would be.

573
01:00:23,858 --> 01:00:24,538
A very

574
01:00:34,662 --> 01:00:35,845
Tell us about this project.

575
01:00:40,035 --> 01:00:40,597
I do class.

576
01:00:41,298 --> 01:00:41,739
Mr luck.

577
01:00:44,145 --> 01:00:44,705
Thank you, class.

578
01:00:44,765 --> 01:00:45,826
Appreciate those comments.

579
01:00:45,886 --> 01:00:48,748
And yeah, we'll definitely be following up with more.

580
01:00:49,368 --> 01:00:56,393
So one of the, I know we just talked through a little bit of the renderings and there were some comments on design as well.

581
01:00:57,133 --> 01:01:03,157
I know on the breakdown of the scale and the context and materials, and especially the glass.

582
01:01:03,517 --> 01:01:04,758
I know Cube 3 is on here.

583
01:01:04,778 --> 01:01:07,259
They could probably talk a little bit through those design comments.

584
01:01:07,339 --> 01:01:10,701
And I know Jacobs is on here as well if they want to add anything.

585
01:01:10,762 --> 01:01:11,442
So feel free to

586
01:01:12,456 --> 01:01:13,136
Sure, thanks.

587
01:01:13,276 --> 01:01:15,077
This is Brian O'Connor.

588
01:01:15,157 --> 01:01:16,277
I appreciate the comments.

589
01:01:16,337 --> 01:01:18,397
I think they were really, really thoughtful.

590
01:01:20,118 --> 01:01:38,862
You know, one of the things that we've been wrestling with a little bit is the making sure that we're not treating the building the same on every side and really thinking about the flow of traffic and the flow of people on Mystic Valley in both east and west directions.

591
01:01:39,842 --> 01:01:41,042
I do think the building

592
01:01:41,955 --> 01:01:48,216
is flat on the west side, sort of facing away from traffic moving away from Medford.

593
01:01:48,256 --> 01:01:49,337
It's a little bit flatter.

594
01:01:50,337 --> 01:01:58,399
I think part of that is due to the efficiency we really need to try to achieve in the typical plates on the building to make the lab functionality work.

595
01:01:58,439 --> 01:02:08,021
But I certainly think your comments about the sawtooth and materiality and transparency are all things we're absolutely happy to look at in more detail.

596
01:02:08,041 --> 01:02:09,981
And I do think also your comment

597
01:02:10,752 --> 01:02:17,319
about the renderings and what it's gonna look like in real life from the public realm is important.

598
01:02:17,379 --> 01:02:26,068
So we should plan on Eastern and Western views at the ground level as you're driving or walking along the edge and from the park across the street.

599
01:02:26,108 --> 01:02:30,112
I think they were all great comments and I think they landed with me, so.

600
01:02:33,016 --> 01:02:33,236
Thanks.

601
01:02:37,428 --> 01:02:45,150
Mr. Locke, I don't know if there were additional answer responses you wanted to mention before we go to other board members.

602
01:02:46,190 --> 01:02:49,831
Yeah, I think the one of the comments that we heard was for the variances.

603
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:55,292
Again, I know Michael Parker had touched on that a little bit, and I don't know if he wants to jump back in and touch on it more.

604
01:02:56,692 --> 01:03:00,273
And I know you mentioned floor plates and those type of things.

605
01:03:00,313 --> 01:03:03,414
So we do have Jacobs on here who could probably help out a little bit as well.

606
01:03:03,694 --> 01:03:05,334
Michael, if you want to just address some of those.

607
01:03:06,321 --> 01:03:07,281
Sure, great, thank you.

608
01:03:07,301 --> 01:03:10,702
Yeah, and I think Jacobs would have a lot to say about this.

609
01:03:10,722 --> 01:03:16,464
And what I would say about the, Mr. Anderson, as you point out, the aggressiveness.

610
01:03:16,924 --> 01:03:22,566
I live in Charlestown, so I appreciated Alicia's comments about not letting lab jump over to Charlestown.

611
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:24,967
So I love the competition.

612
01:03:25,107 --> 01:03:29,628
But I also live in an area where MGH has some labs.

613
01:03:30,408 --> 01:03:35,210
And their outdated labs from many, many years ago are pretty small, right?

614
01:03:35,630 --> 01:03:36,798
your two or three stories.

615
01:03:36,939 --> 01:03:37,946
And I think what we're seeing.

616
01:03:38,572 --> 01:03:46,258
For contemporary lab space is you need to have certain design components to make them successful as this industry has grown.

617
01:03:47,159 --> 01:03:56,106
So I'm looking at things like the floor plate that you brought up, minimum floor to floor heights, you need at least 15 feet for duct work.

618
01:03:57,207 --> 01:04:04,012
Things like the support systems, they take up about 50% of the building itself.

619
01:04:04,372 --> 01:04:06,714
You've got the minimum spans, the least spans of 45 to 55 feet.

620
01:04:08,435 --> 01:04:17,940
So, you know, it feels maybe it does feel like it's aggressive, but for a contemporary life sciences building, these are the way that these are the way that they're being built right now.

621
01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:21,762
So I don't know if anyone from Jacobs would like to piggyback on that.

622
01:04:23,363 --> 01:04:24,563
Yeah, I can piggyback on that.

623
01:04:24,664 --> 01:04:28,945
I'm Scott Aquilina from Jacobs and my colleague Stefan spoke previously.

624
01:04:28,965 --> 01:04:43,991
Our role right now in this early design phase is to make sure that the fundamentals of the building are going to support a state-of-the-art, modern life science building that will be attractive to future tenants.

625
01:04:45,052 --> 01:04:48,353
And so what was discussed in terms of the Florida 4-Height

626
01:04:49,075 --> 01:05:01,863
and the spacing of the columns in a kind of a wide module are all things that allow for very flexible lab office layouts in a market that is very active right now, but still very competitive.

627
01:05:02,263 --> 01:05:11,729
And the expectations for space in terms of functionality, but also in terms of ambiance is very high.

628
01:05:13,550 --> 01:05:15,391
So that, and the,

629
01:05:16,590 --> 01:05:29,212
The footprint is really dictated by kind of the typical 40, 60% lab office mix and kind of what the marketplace is sort of indicating in terms of what the capacity needs to be on those floors.

630
01:05:29,953 --> 01:05:35,694
So that the building is designed internally, the building is designed kind of from those parameters.

631
01:05:36,734 --> 01:05:41,715
You're also can see on this design that there are two levels of penthouse.

632
01:05:43,937 --> 01:05:51,103
And that actually is a good thing because it means that more of the mechanical systems are going to be concealed rather than exposed in any way.

633
01:05:51,123 --> 01:05:58,128
And so, again, there's a lot of mechanical that comes into servicing those lab areas.

634
01:05:58,809 --> 01:06:01,671
So that's what I would add at this point in time on that.

635
01:06:04,411 --> 01:06:07,795
There was a question about the kind of the amount of glass in the building.

636
01:06:07,975 --> 01:06:15,745
One of the things that we look forward to is as we develop the design is that the building would be less reflective and more transparent.

637
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:23,841
um, so that, um, activities, uh, and features within the building would be able to be revealed.

638
01:06:24,401 --> 01:06:32,743
Um, the depth of the building would be revealed, um, and that would feel a little bit less, um, potentially feel more inviting, uh, and more inhabited.

639
01:06:33,163 --> 01:06:37,344
Um, and that would be something that we would try to develop as, uh, as the design progresses.

640
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:43,585
Thank you.

641
01:06:44,265 --> 01:06:44,425
Um,

642
01:06:46,412 --> 01:06:49,435
I appreciate you getting into those topics.

643
01:06:49,615 --> 01:07:04,808
It's one of the questions that I had too was just understanding the kind of the business rationale and thought process for the massing of the building, like why eight stories and why the massing that you have there.

644
01:07:06,729 --> 01:07:13,135
So more details about that could be helpful for us as well.

645
01:07:13,255 --> 01:07:14,716
I'd be interested in learning more about that.

646
01:07:17,513 --> 01:07:27,117
Yeah, I mean, I would definitely encourage just thinking very carefully, you know, totally understanding, you know, the typical lab widths and all the needs.

647
01:07:27,297 --> 01:07:39,761
But also, you know, I think it seems to me like if you tighten, you know, sharpen your pencils a little bit, you might be able to knock one or two of those variances away.

648
01:07:39,781 --> 01:07:42,602
And I think that would be a pretty compelling story.

649
01:07:45,377 --> 01:08:02,090
to say that you thought about that and I think, you know, the board should also understand that, you know, the building is eight stories, but mechanical penthouses are going to be in the 45 foot range so you're essentially adding three more stories to the building.

650
01:08:02,110 --> 01:08:11,037
In terms of massing and that's just for the benefit of my fellow board members to understand so it's essentially an 11 story building.

651
01:08:12,904 --> 01:08:17,046
the penthouses don't count towards the height of the building.

652
01:08:17,146 --> 01:08:28,051
So it's pretty big and pretty tall, and it might be merited, especially if there's talk about future developments of similar heights.

653
01:08:28,111 --> 01:08:33,694
And I certainly know the residential building a couple doors down is probably in that neighborhood as well.

654
01:08:33,794 --> 01:08:35,695
So there's also precedent.

655
01:08:37,576 --> 01:08:38,876
But yeah, thanks for all your comments.

656
01:08:41,148 --> 01:08:46,231
I'd like to ask our other board members if they have some questions or comments that they'd like to get out.

657
01:08:46,371 --> 01:08:46,711
Jackie.

658
01:08:46,731 --> 01:08:48,572
Hi, hello.

659
01:08:48,692 --> 01:08:53,795
I'm Jackie Furtado, the Community Development Board Vice Chair.

660
01:08:54,335 --> 01:08:54,895
Thank you all.

661
01:08:55,015 --> 01:09:00,138
I want to preface my comment by first saying that I think this is an amazing opportunity for the city of Medford.

662
01:09:00,778 --> 01:09:06,661
But as with all boards, we do have a duty to the city as well as the residents.

663
01:09:07,502 --> 01:09:09,743
And that's where we start to get into the details.

664
01:09:10,278 --> 01:09:17,019
One of the things I wanted to do is echo my colleagues and well, echo others before me.

665
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:22,281
And me as an economic development specialist myself, I see that as a great opportunity, right?

666
01:09:22,301 --> 01:09:29,022
But I think that's where I want all these great things, but I would need an engineer to explain to me how this is gonna happen.

667
01:09:29,542 --> 01:09:35,203
An architect, I need it to be explained to me in layman's terms, exactly how places already spelt it out.

668
01:09:35,403 --> 01:09:37,884
I would need to see this a little bit more from,

669
01:09:39,539 --> 01:09:46,404
a residential or again, layman's terms, just so that I can take it in and see how awesome this opportunity can be.

670
01:09:46,945 --> 01:10:01,395
And in saying that, I'll leave the design alone for now, but, and I know that we're really looking at the site itself, but one of the things that caught my eye and my attention was the 422 parking spaces that actually impact off the site.

671
01:10:01,736 --> 01:10:04,638
And I'm just trying to better understand that as well.

672
01:10:05,152 --> 01:10:10,794
I believe it was Stephanie from VHB that explained earlier that there was some environmental impacts that were going to trigger MEPA.

673
01:10:11,374 --> 01:10:22,058
I was wondering if one, if that was transportation and two, the 422 parking spaces, I see that there is a biking incentive.

674
01:10:22,078 --> 01:10:28,880
Are there any other incentives to match, to bring the users of that site to the MBTA Wellington Circle?

675
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:33,182
I didn't hear much about that and how that was going to be used, the pedestrian use.

676
01:10:33,542 --> 01:10:34,462
I also know that

677
01:10:35,193 --> 01:10:45,578
Todd Blake, our transportation commissioner, has mentioned something about pedestrian walkways, but I wasn't sure how the proponent is going to envision that.

678
01:10:45,758 --> 01:10:57,483
There's just so many things that I would like to better understand so that I can see how this amazing opportunity can fit better in Medford.

679
01:10:58,464 --> 01:11:01,665
And especially with that Wellington Circle, I know that MassDOT has had

680
01:11:02,122 --> 01:11:11,045
some previous problems with the city and just trying to mitigate the traffic that's already a little crazy there in what it's intersection.

681
01:11:11,085 --> 01:11:18,968
So again, I'm just as a board member and a resident that lives on Mystic Valley Parkway, mind you, I'm just trying to better understand how this all goes together.

682
01:11:18,988 --> 01:11:21,108
And thank you.

683
01:11:22,409 --> 01:11:23,689
And that's the only thing I have.

684
01:11:23,949 --> 01:11:30,131
Yeah, Andre, I just wanted to echo that and see if we could hear a little bit more about the traffic study.

685
01:11:30,351 --> 01:11:31,932
And I saw Todd Blake had

686
01:11:32,949 --> 01:11:40,151
done a nice report on it and had recommendations for mitigation and what the team thought about that.

687
01:11:44,393 --> 01:11:44,593
Thanks.

688
01:11:44,613 --> 01:11:49,014
Would you like Commissioner Blake on?

689
01:11:52,275 --> 01:11:52,515
Sure.

690
01:11:53,475 --> 01:11:58,277
If he doesn't mind giving a summary of his report.

691
01:12:04,655 --> 01:12:05,676
I'll be still there.

692
01:12:07,097 --> 01:12:07,778
Yeah.

693
01:12:08,518 --> 01:12:11,321
Thank you, Mr chair and board members.

694
01:12:11,701 --> 01:12:12,502
Can you hear me fine.

695
01:12:13,182 --> 01:12:13,423
Yes.

696
01:12:14,624 --> 01:12:24,932
So, yeah, as usual that the proponents traffic engineers there's decent job and you're trying to estimate impacts but as we know it's, you know, estimated so there could be.

697
01:12:25,805 --> 01:12:43,482
You know that it's projection based and the impacts may not be exactly what they state in their report so I just tried to highlight some things that could happen in terms, some, maybe for the better some maybe for the worst depending on trip distribution particular, because it's a right in right out only site.

698
01:12:45,023 --> 01:12:48,767
The driveways and it's a, because it's a medium mystic Valley Parkway.

699
01:12:49,315 --> 01:13:12,634
all the trips in have to come in a certain direction all trips out will go in one direction right so so how do they get to and from the, you know, the exiting to the south or east and when they're coming in, you know how do they get to the site so, so, you know, they had to make some trip distribution assumption so there's no necessarily fault but, you know, depending on how that shakes out some intersections in some areas could be more impacted than others.

700
01:13:14,850 --> 01:13:29,034
So in terms of like other board members had mentioned, we always look to opportunities to reduce single occupant vehicle trips by, you know, trying to encourage and improve bicycling and psych transit use and pedestrian use so.

701
01:13:29,674 --> 01:13:37,797
So my review had suggested some things to help address those or help encourage those other uses.

702
01:13:38,957 --> 01:13:42,379
modes, I mean, to reduce vehicle dependency.

703
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:53,846
So, you know, I quickly touched on some of the proponent had mentioned the feasibility study for a crosswalk crossing mix about Mr. Kelly Parkway in the vicinity of the site.

704
01:13:54,447 --> 01:13:56,408
So I suggest besides just studying it.

705
01:13:57,368 --> 01:13:59,769
designing and constructing implementation of it.

706
01:14:00,649 --> 01:14:10,771
So, it's likely would have some sort of enhancement to it so that it's not just an uncivilized crosswalk which could be a little daunting to cross that road.

707
01:14:11,212 --> 01:14:20,054
So something like RFP is or, or pedestrian hybrid beacon or something like that, working with mass duty because it's their roadway that it'd be subject to their review.

708
01:14:21,714 --> 01:14:29,882
So, you know, curve space is valuable and competitive so other potential uses for that shoulder that exists in Mr Valley Parkway.

709
01:14:30,503 --> 01:14:40,233
So you could either do bump outs for pedestrians to shorten the distance, or you could add bike lanes and that shoulder on either side, which then you wouldn't be able to do the bump outs, or, you know,

710
01:14:42,007 --> 01:14:51,611
Depending on what happens with the bus network redesign MBTA, you know, there's also competition of potentially bus lanes and things like that, but they all kind of occupy the same space on the shoulder.

711
01:14:52,171 --> 01:14:57,553
So, with that being said, if the state for some reason didn't approve the.

712
01:14:59,128 --> 01:15:10,839
the new pedestrian crosswalk enhanced crosswalk then we give some options of other things they could do like countdown pedestrian indications that various signals for sponsoring a blue bike station and, and bikes as well.

713
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:14,002
We also suggest.

714
01:15:16,077 --> 01:15:26,982
designing conceptually a buffered bicycle lanes painted in the roadway in the right now usable shoulders but they posted as no parking so they're basically unused.

715
01:15:28,263 --> 01:15:35,266
So if we could help utilize that space there that's already paved on both sides of the street will help connect a lot of things that meant for us going on.

716
01:15:35,926 --> 01:15:39,168
We're looking into a lot of trail systems to the west of the site.

717
01:15:39,728 --> 01:15:40,528
We're looking into.

718
01:15:42,209 --> 01:16:04,677
blue bikes to the east of the site to connect better to the MBTA station so so a lot of looking into bicycle facilities on Mr Valley Park would be very helpful to connect into other projects we have going on we have an underpass project going on at 25% design that would connect the McDonnell Park area over to the MBTA station without having to cross route 28, and that would directly benefit

719
01:16:05,558 --> 01:16:09,321
This type of development so any connections to and from those is very important.

720
01:16:09,781 --> 01:16:18,708
In addition, there's some recent zoning change or zoning changes that referred to translate to management.

721
01:16:19,169 --> 01:16:28,616
So we're, you know, I'm recommending that they join the local TMA, which helps, you know, with that sort of thing and provide valuable insights of what they could do.

722
01:16:29,875 --> 01:16:34,825
In terms of employee discounts for T pass things like that or, or just even pre tax.

723
01:16:35,747 --> 01:16:38,633
In addition to that I'm just looking at my memo at the same time.

724
01:16:41,529 --> 01:16:53,455
So yeah, in lieu of the TMA, if for some reason the proponent was going to have, say, their own shuttle to and from MBTA station, then that would, in my mind, negate the need for the TMA because they'd have a direct TDM measure.

725
01:16:53,895 --> 01:17:06,961
But those TMA type services are provided because a lot of times an individual development won't have the resources, won't be big enough to do it all by themselves so they could pool resources and that sort of thing.

726
01:17:07,021 --> 01:17:08,161
So then in addition to that,

727
01:17:12,149 --> 01:17:30,164
I wanted to stress that because the right and right only they need guide signage, directing people of how to do the potential jug handle move that look, Mr Carly Parkway to locus street, so that they're off to the right, take a left and take another left to perform, essentially a legal U turn.

728
01:17:30,704 --> 01:17:39,391
So, so things to educate, whoever ends up being an employer, employee at this facility, letting them know how to get around would be valuable.

729
01:17:41,847 --> 01:17:58,851
So I'm recommending vehicle video detection on some of the area, traffic signals as well because the study assumed it was actuated but when, when detection is broken it ends up running free time so it's not as efficient, and depending on which way that exiting trips go.

730
01:18:00,031 --> 01:18:04,712
They likely will go through commercial at the parkway and commercial at Riverside and

731
01:18:05,312 --> 01:18:09,254
right now due to disrepair that those are not functioning.

732
01:18:09,294 --> 01:18:18,858
So and by going video versus roadway it will help in the future not to be impacted by road deterioration or utility companies digging them up.

733
01:18:19,918 --> 01:18:23,460
So hopefully that summarizes it for you Deanna and everyone.

734
01:18:23,540 --> 01:18:28,702
Yeah I think that the signals are important given like as you said the right in right out.

735
01:18:30,241 --> 01:18:38,568
without a U-turn ability, getting back to say 93, there's no ramp, I don't think.

736
01:18:40,169 --> 01:18:44,472
Yeah, there's no ramp west of the site.

737
01:18:44,492 --> 01:18:52,639
So you basically, like if you do it from Google, it brings you all the way to like downtown Medford on Clippership Drive to get back to go north.

738
01:18:52,699 --> 01:18:54,200
So it's sort of a tricky

739
01:18:54,926 --> 01:19:00,170
way unless you do a U-turn going back to Wellington Circle to get around there to get back.

740
01:19:00,970 --> 01:19:13,579
Yeah, in the trip distribution they had I think 40% or so going Riverside towards Medford Square, and then the other option would be potentially they showed 9% Felsway west north to get to INA3.

741
01:19:13,859 --> 01:19:15,240
As many of us know there's three different

742
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:19,723
exits to take on 93 so you could go to either one of them.

743
01:19:20,164 --> 01:19:25,929
So that's a very good point, because otherwise to get to some of these yeah they have to circle a major block so.

744
01:19:26,970 --> 01:19:37,399
Yeah, and also I just want to reiterate that if the detection isn't working, then what's shown for level of service and stuff like that in the TIS is not accurate.

745
01:19:37,419 --> 01:19:39,761
So, it's important to fix the detection.

746
01:19:43,370 --> 01:19:45,191
And just to add to those comments.

747
01:19:46,572 --> 01:19:58,599
I agree like all the the exiting traffic is going to feed into some already kind of challenging bottlenecks, either at mystic have or route.

748
01:19:58,859 --> 01:20:05,983
You know, 16 West, or cutting through the school area to get over to, you know, Riverside have or potentially going down.

749
01:20:06,363 --> 01:20:25,553
I mean, seems to me, maybe the best preferable option would be to go down, you know, commercial street and try to get back over to the fells, you know, route 28 but you that as may, we have to think about how we're directing the traffic and.

750
01:20:26,462 --> 01:20:35,958
It seems to me that better than the best outcome of all would be to have a larger proportion of the

751
01:20:37,538 --> 01:20:56,464
employees either taking public transportation from Wellington, which is just a half a mile or less away, or biking, which is a fabulous regional bike network is just getting better and better all the time right across the street.

752
01:20:56,864 --> 01:21:06,367
So I'm wondering if you could speak a little bit more to how you're going to incentivize commuters to use those alternative modes and

753
01:21:07,087 --> 01:21:10,711
Why do you need over 400 parking spaces?

754
01:21:13,753 --> 01:21:14,935
Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chair.

755
01:21:14,995 --> 01:21:16,956
And I'll echo Michael's comments.

756
01:21:17,016 --> 01:21:18,158
I live in Charlestown as well.

757
01:21:18,218 --> 01:21:20,800
So I'm very much dealing with traffic every day.

758
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:22,882
And I know that's a hot topic on everyone's minds.

759
01:21:24,043 --> 01:21:25,805
I do want to pass it over to Ryan White.

760
01:21:25,845 --> 01:21:31,210
He's on our BHB team and he's done all the transportation work on the project.

761
01:21:31,230 --> 01:21:32,391
So Ryan, feel free to jump in.

762
01:21:33,244 --> 01:21:34,305
Yeah, sure.

763
01:21:34,365 --> 01:21:38,870
So I think all everyone's comments here are are exactly on point.

764
01:21:39,010 --> 01:21:54,826
But I mean, I think that is a benefit of this site to that there is a good possibility, potential for dispersion of these trips to multiple different exits in along 93 to help spread that out.

765
01:21:54,886 --> 01:21:55,787
And as Todd mentioned,

766
01:21:56,484 --> 01:22:08,953
That's how we approach this traffic study is assigning appropriate different percentages of these project generated trips onto the various different routes that can be imagined.

767
01:22:08,973 --> 01:22:25,544
I think from the mitigation standpoint, I don't think the team has any concerns and actually looks forward to having conversations with the city and incorporating all of the elements that Todd had mentioned in the letter.

768
01:22:26,105 --> 01:22:38,158
Um, obviously, a lot of those elements require close coordination with D. O. T. Um, and D. C. R. Just due to the, um, the park across the way, um, and, um, Mystic Valley Parkway as a whole.

769
01:22:38,738 --> 01:22:39,919
Um, I think as, um.

770
01:22:41,037 --> 01:22:42,718
tenants coming into this building.

771
01:22:44,158 --> 01:23:09,467
From the traffic study perspective, we wanted to make the most conservative assumption, which is assuming that everyone's driving here with the end goal to be far better than that by providing and kind of encouraging people to use alternative modes by providing them these facilities, as we mentioned, providing secure indoor bike parking so their bike is not outside

772
01:23:10,144 --> 01:23:32,411
Um, having, um, on-site coordinators to help people, um, sort out the, um, potential commuting patterns, whether it be bikes or transit, working with DOT to, um, determine the feasibility of this mid-block crossing to better connect to the bike paths, um, um, along the river, as well as connecting, um, to the MBTA.

773
01:23:33,051 --> 01:23:38,333
Um, so all things that, um, we're exploring, but

774
01:23:39,373 --> 01:23:48,679
This building, just with the size, I mean, it's expected to have a population of about 500 to 550 people in this building.

775
01:23:49,400 --> 01:24:01,207
So we do need to make sure that parking is provided on the site for those that are forced to take vehicles just due to where they live.

776
01:24:02,691 --> 01:24:17,287
as well as making sure that none of this parking spills over into the streets or the other roadway networks and the site is self-contained and can support the whole population that will be coming to and from the site each day.

777
01:24:23,594 --> 01:24:24,014
Thank you.

778
01:24:24,034 --> 01:24:32,919
And I'm assuming that this building is being built without specific tenants in mind.

779
01:24:32,939 --> 01:24:33,859
Is that correct?

780
01:24:38,202 --> 01:24:39,222
Yes, that's correct.

781
01:24:39,242 --> 01:24:48,927
We are targeting BSL level one or two labs, which is the lower end of the safety or the biosafety levels for labs.

782
01:24:48,967 --> 01:24:50,528
So we'd be talking about

783
01:24:51,132 --> 01:24:56,335
your general research labs, nothing in level three and four.

784
01:24:56,375 --> 01:24:59,257
That's when you get into more serious chemicals and things like that.

785
01:24:59,277 --> 01:25:00,438
So we're not expecting that.

786
01:25:01,218 --> 01:25:03,620
However, we don't have a tenant in mind yet.

787
01:25:04,980 --> 01:25:11,044
We are trying to make this program as flexible as possible to get a get a future tenant into the building.

788
01:25:12,405 --> 01:25:12,505
Right.

789
01:25:13,325 --> 01:25:20,711
And could you also just talk a little bit about the kind of trash removal systems that happening through the loading dock?

790
01:25:22,133 --> 01:25:24,755
Any, you know, medical waste, how that's being handled?

791
01:25:28,431 --> 01:25:29,092
Yeah, absolutely.

792
01:25:29,112 --> 01:25:34,577
And I'll let the architects and the engineers, I'm going to call it Jacobs and Cube 3 take that.

793
01:25:35,238 --> 01:25:41,925
They will be, of course, any trash removal will be subject to city of Medford policies and state policies.

794
01:25:41,945 --> 01:25:47,090
So we'll be following those guidelines, but Cube 3 and Jacobs, I don't know if you guys want to hop in real quick.

795
01:25:48,965 --> 01:26:07,777
Well, in terms of any lab waste, like liquids, chemicals, or other materials, they're stored on site in a safe location, in a used chemical storage room, and then taken off site on a regular basis.

796
01:26:07,838 --> 01:26:11,160
So it's handled separately, so lab waste is handled.

797
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:16,462
separately, contained separately and handled it by a separate contract for removals.

798
01:26:16,922 --> 01:26:18,982
And is that room adjacent to the loading dock?

799
01:26:19,863 --> 01:26:27,645
Yes, it would be adjacent to the service elevator and the loading dock within the core and available to all tenants.

800
01:26:27,765 --> 01:26:35,368
It would be written into the lease for tenants to be able to have that kind of capacity for all tenants.

801
01:26:36,747 --> 01:26:43,470
And conventional trash would be handled in a similar location and taken out through that enclosed loading dock area.

802
01:26:44,350 --> 01:26:44,570
Yeah.

803
01:26:44,990 --> 01:26:51,713
And just to add to that, one of the, one of the main reasons, one of the other reasons why it's over near the loading dock is to avoid the front edge of the site.

804
01:26:51,733 --> 01:26:54,254
We don't want trash or smells building up at the front edge.

805
01:26:54,274 --> 01:26:56,475
We have the retail space out there.

806
01:26:56,515 --> 01:26:58,216
We have a community flex space in

807
01:26:58,826 --> 01:27:04,291
in the ground floor that we don't want smelling like trash, obviously, if we're inviting the community and we don't want that.

808
01:27:04,351 --> 01:27:07,873
So another reason why it's back already loading docks as well.

809
01:27:10,195 --> 01:27:10,516
Thank you.

810
01:27:10,536 --> 01:27:15,540
Do other board members have comments or questions?

811
01:27:17,796 --> 01:27:19,218
Hi, Andrea, this is Christy.

812
01:27:19,278 --> 01:27:21,300
I'd like to ask just a few questions.

813
01:27:22,241 --> 01:27:29,027
I just want to thank our fellow board members for the detailed questions they asked and I concur with a lot of their statements.

814
01:27:30,248 --> 01:27:42,099
This may be a question for the city, but in terms of thinking of the longer term plan for the multiple parcels that are coming on the market in this area, is there any thought giving to

815
01:27:43,633 --> 01:27:57,841
how this first development and future developments may start to connect in the future and allow possibilities for connection between the parcels as you think of it as a possibility to become like a future campus?

816
01:28:03,485 --> 01:28:04,345
Anybody want to take that?

817
01:28:05,746 --> 01:28:06,907
It's a great question.

818
01:28:11,581 --> 01:28:20,023
Yes, we have in terms of how to improve the existing sidewalk infrastructure and street infrastructure.

819
01:28:20,083 --> 01:28:28,025
If you think of commercial street, that really functions as a back alley to some of the logistics companies there.

820
01:28:28,145 --> 01:28:34,426
We see that transitioning into more of a fully functioning pedestrian friendly streets.

821
01:28:35,886 --> 01:28:38,907
We strongly encourage rise to

822
01:28:40,130 --> 01:28:44,873
activate the ground level with the plaza, with retail.

823
01:28:49,175 --> 01:29:03,204
I think in terms of a campus, we envision future improvements to the wetland area that may be able to build some pedestrian connectivity behind these buildings.

824
01:29:04,164 --> 01:29:07,266
Through that, actually, staff just took a tour of

825
01:29:08,547 --> 01:29:13,271
the Alewife fresh pond area and some of the improvements they've made over there.

826
01:29:13,291 --> 01:29:20,297
We're really impressed by some of the boardwalk features that they've implemented and walkways and such.

827
01:29:20,357 --> 01:29:25,361
So from that aspect, yes, we are thinking about it.

828
01:29:25,421 --> 01:29:31,166
I think that goes to the broader study and vision we'd like to implement here.

829
01:29:34,300 --> 01:29:42,687
We're not quite there yet, but certainly are thinking about those on a project by project basis and encouraging rise.

830
01:29:43,588 --> 01:29:51,874
They didn't get into it much tonight, but have talked to neighboring property owners and have actually put a lot of thought into what the future of this could look like.

831
01:29:51,995 --> 01:29:58,960
And it's tough, difficult to see on just this single site, but I think it's there and can happen.

832
01:29:59,281 --> 01:30:03,064
They're certainly not limiting that potential.

833
01:30:05,144 --> 01:30:05,544
Thank you.

834
01:30:06,825 --> 01:30:12,089
In terms of the community benefits I noticed there's communities flex space.

835
01:30:13,190 --> 01:30:20,215
Would you mind explaining what your vision and intent is for that space and the community access to that.

836
01:30:23,041 --> 01:30:24,001
Sure, yeah.

837
01:30:24,341 --> 01:30:32,784
One of the things that came out of the initial design of this project was we did have additional space on the ground floor.

838
01:30:33,064 --> 01:30:36,805
We had already included the retail, we had already included the landscape area.

839
01:30:37,225 --> 01:30:43,247
And this space was sort of, you couldn't do a ton with it, but it was large.

840
01:30:43,287 --> 01:30:45,688
It was almost 9,000 square feet of space.

841
01:30:45,728 --> 01:30:49,409
And we really wanted to make sure that we were utilizing that to the best of our ability.

842
01:30:50,277 --> 01:30:58,789
What we've done is we have since the beginning allocated that as a community flex space, and we haven't really designed what that space is going to be.

843
01:30:58,869 --> 01:31:04,638
But we've already been talking with, you know, a few groups about the potential to bring a nonprofit group into that space.

844
01:31:05,485 --> 01:31:09,510
and really activate it even more to bring more folks to the site.

845
01:31:10,291 --> 01:31:20,223
We've talked with the Medford Vocational High School about potentially bringing people into that, children, youth, high schoolers into that space.

846
01:31:20,263 --> 01:31:21,184
They have an upcoming

847
01:31:21,809 --> 01:31:28,937
uh, bio, uh, life science program that, that principal Fallon has been, uh, you know, talking to us about.

848
01:31:29,037 --> 01:31:34,844
So, uh, we envisioned that that could happen down there, uh, and really a multitude of different things.

849
01:31:34,924 --> 01:31:40,950
It could be, you know, lounge space, you know, some sort of working pods, anything in between there.

850
01:31:40,970 --> 01:31:43,173
We really wanted to make sure that we left.

851
01:31:43,748 --> 01:31:46,671
the space open to opportunities in the future.

852
01:31:47,091 --> 01:31:52,015
And if anybody on this board does have any ideas, we're happy to take them into consideration.

853
01:31:52,055 --> 01:31:59,482
I know we've been involved in the community for about a year now, but obviously everyone on this board has a lot more experience in the community.

854
01:31:59,522 --> 01:32:08,130
So if you do have any suggestions, the design team here is happy to take them into consideration and start looking a little bit deeper into what this space could be.

855
01:32:08,867 --> 01:32:10,567
So I appreciate that question, Christy.

856
01:32:10,587 --> 01:32:11,107
Thank you so much.

857
01:32:11,147 --> 01:32:13,548
Yeah, no, I think that's really important.

858
01:32:13,608 --> 01:32:37,233
I think having a space that allows for intentional interactions with the community for educational purposes, for training purposes, even around workforce development, but really leveraging this as the first major life science building in the city of Medford and making people aware and having access to the science.

859
01:32:38,613 --> 01:32:42,896
and a better understanding of what goes on in this building is a benefit.

860
01:32:45,437 --> 01:32:57,864
I would just like to reinforce the request or suggestion for renderings and perspectives of how pedestrians will really experience the building.

861
01:32:57,884 --> 01:33:07,510
They will never experience it from up top, so really understanding how the pedestrian engages with the building at the street level.

862
01:33:07,957 --> 01:33:09,158
would be much appreciated.

863
01:33:10,839 --> 01:33:11,219
Thank you.

864
01:33:11,319 --> 01:33:11,940
Thank you, Christy.

865
01:33:11,980 --> 01:33:12,700
Appreciate those.

866
01:33:12,741 --> 01:33:18,545
I know we do have one rendering of the frontage of the building from the ground level.

867
01:33:18,605 --> 01:33:26,731
I'm not sure if someone from Q3 has that readily available, but we did have one made up from the ground level as if you're walking or biking on the street.

868
01:33:26,911 --> 01:33:28,632
So we're happy to share that with you.

869
01:33:29,153 --> 01:33:32,655
If not tonight, we can for sure send that over to you as well.

870
01:33:33,816 --> 01:33:34,476
Great, thanks.

871
01:33:34,536 --> 01:33:36,598
We'll follow up with that, Clement.

872
01:33:38,427 --> 01:33:59,393
One final comment I have just reading through Medford Historic Commission comments is, are there any concerns from your end on some of their comments and how that may affect how you move forward with maintaining the design of the building or addressing the impacts that they identified?

873
01:34:02,157 --> 01:34:03,138
Thank you, Christy.

874
01:34:03,238 --> 01:34:07,043
I'll let Brian from Cube 3 and Jacobs handle that question.

875
01:34:07,063 --> 01:34:07,823
Thank you.

876
01:34:08,044 --> 01:34:09,505
On the historical commission?

877
01:34:10,587 --> 01:34:12,429
Yeah, I think we read that.

878
01:34:12,689 --> 01:34:16,193
I think we'll go through that in detail.

879
01:34:17,421 --> 01:34:26,828
I think one of the challenges here is this is, as has been mentioned on the call, there's not a lot of precedent for this building typology in Medford.

880
01:34:27,748 --> 01:34:31,251
I think we need to read that carefully.

881
01:34:31,271 --> 01:34:32,972
I think we need to be responsive.

882
01:34:33,893 --> 01:34:39,076
I also think we need to be careful not to try to make this building feel historical.

883
01:34:39,737 --> 01:34:42,699
I mean, I think this is sort of a forward leaning building

884
01:34:43,715 --> 01:34:46,957
for this city, one that I think is important to future development.

885
01:34:47,017 --> 01:34:49,798
We don't want it to feel like it doesn't belong here.

886
01:34:51,178 --> 01:34:55,560
And there's been sort of a lot of thoughts so far on the mass and scale and the management of that.

887
01:34:55,720 --> 01:35:05,785
I think the earlier comments about, you know, thinking about, you know, how these sawtooth forms really can work to break down the volume, thinking about a little bit more

888
01:35:06,572 --> 01:35:07,632
I don't know if it's a little bit more.

889
01:35:07,652 --> 01:35:12,633
Opacity potentially or a little bit more transparency versus reflectivity.

890
01:35:12,653 --> 01:35:14,474
I think we could really get there.

891
01:35:14,594 --> 01:35:22,116
So I don't have the answers right now, but we did read the comments and I think we're prepared to really make some positive engagement on them.

892
01:35:24,596 --> 01:35:24,896
Thank you.

893
01:35:37,077 --> 01:35:49,835
I guess I've lived here for 20 plus years and Wellington traffic has been an issue throughout, and it doesn't get better as there's obviously more and more development in that area.

894
01:35:51,411 --> 01:36:12,486
It's one thing I kind of wish we were going more for the plans district because it would go to city council and we'd have more public, public input on that issue in particular because those are the folks who are going to get the phone calls if that traffic spills out into the various neighborhoods of the city and hasn't created a negative impact on our residents but

895
01:36:13,846 --> 01:36:16,647
There's only so much I guess we can do at this point as a board.

896
01:36:17,968 --> 01:36:22,249
I think a shuttle to Wellington is got to be, it just, it just has to happen.

897
01:36:22,570 --> 01:36:39,737
And obviously that's not going to happen on day one before you lease the building or much of the building but you've got to be able to connect folks to the orange line, I think, above and beyond those who are comfortable with biking and more aggressive non driving options.

898
01:36:41,678 --> 01:36:49,723
Are there showers in the building, plans for showers, not for the public's consumption, but for those employees working in the building?

899
01:36:52,485 --> 01:36:57,489
I don't know that we have an actual direct shower plan right now.

900
01:36:57,569 --> 01:37:09,317
I think as the building footprints develop, as the end users are identified, I mean, it's certainly something that could evolve, but I don't think we have a direct plan for that right now in the building footprint.

901
01:37:10,687 --> 01:37:10,847
Yeah.

902
01:37:11,007 --> 01:37:11,588
Okay.

903
01:37:11,628 --> 01:37:11,908
Yeah.

904
01:37:12,088 --> 01:37:17,030
And just to answer your shuttle question, David, it's not something that we're foreign to.

905
01:37:17,070 --> 01:37:20,873
We're actually working on a shuttle plan for another project in Dorchester right now.

906
01:37:21,733 --> 01:37:26,496
So it's not something that's unfamiliar to us and something we can certainly look into for you as well.

907
01:37:28,537 --> 01:37:34,420
Electric charging stations in your garages, did your plans include a number of those as well?

908
01:37:36,317 --> 01:37:40,740
Yeah, I think we're certainly able to incorporate those within the within the planning.

909
01:37:42,081 --> 01:37:49,285
Okay, I had some concerns I guess around just the, you know, it is such a tall building on a relatively small footprint.

910
01:37:51,546 --> 01:38:01,973
I was very surprised we didn't hear more from police and fire on the rotation accessibility entrance exit at the site.

911
01:38:03,447 --> 01:38:10,051
Given that it's only a right turn out, I'd be concerned that you're going to have folks queuing in the drive lane.

912
01:38:10,131 --> 01:38:13,012
And if something happens at the wrong time, that could be a real problem.

913
01:38:15,374 --> 01:38:27,760
Does anyone from the city know, I mean, does the city even have equipment to deal with the height of this building at the, from the access point, which will be so close to the building itself?

914
01:38:29,581 --> 01:38:31,402
Can they get to a top floor and put out a fire?

915
01:38:36,043 --> 01:38:42,866
Andre, David, actually Chief Friedman is on the on the I saw him.

916
01:38:45,728 --> 01:38:47,129
He's still on.

917
01:38:47,469 --> 01:38:47,989
I'm right here.

918
01:38:48,009 --> 01:38:49,130
Okay.

919
01:38:51,811 --> 01:38:56,153
So, to answer your question about the getting to the top floor.

920
01:38:58,054 --> 01:39:03,197
Obviously a building this tall, you know, you know our aerials.

921
01:39:04,121 --> 01:39:06,683
The way we would fight a fire in this would be from the interior.

922
01:39:07,704 --> 01:39:14,770
So we look at elevators and stairwells and pipes inside.

923
01:39:14,790 --> 01:39:17,813
So we would basically take a high rise back and go in and fight it from inside.

924
01:39:18,533 --> 01:39:22,437
As far as getting to the roof, it's definitely taller than our longest ladder.

925
01:39:22,497 --> 01:39:26,440
So clearly it fits the definition of a high rise.

926
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:32,085
And that's why the codes are all there that we would go in and fight the fire from the inside.

927
01:39:36,618 --> 01:39:45,527
As far as like the proximity to the building, I guess the closer to the building you get, the higher you can go, obviously.

928
01:39:45,947 --> 01:39:55,636
So, but you know, with this building, like I said, we're not gonna, the heights of the floors and stuff, raise it up over the highest ladder.

929
01:39:55,656 --> 01:40:00,601
So once that happens, it's considered high rise and then like I said, we'll fight everything from inside.

930
01:40:04,681 --> 01:40:06,042
Okay, I appreciate your input.

931
01:40:06,142 --> 01:40:06,582
Thank you.

932
01:40:07,123 --> 01:40:10,545
Pete, could you just state that that's a standard thing?

933
01:40:10,605 --> 01:40:13,227
It's not because we don't have anything this tall, right?

934
01:40:13,607 --> 01:40:18,370
Because I'll note we have buildings behind City Hall that are pretty tall.

935
01:40:18,510 --> 01:40:20,992
I, off the top of my head, don't know how tall they are.

936
01:40:21,692 --> 01:40:25,335
But is this, you're not, are you making do versus this is how you do it?

937
01:40:26,437 --> 01:40:28,017
No, this is how you would do it.

938
01:40:28,097 --> 01:40:29,578
This is the way the code works.

939
01:40:29,658 --> 01:40:32,479
And when they go over that height of the ladder, that's fluid.

940
01:40:33,059 --> 01:40:54,745
It also changes, it brings into light all the other codes that would make it, it changes the construction of it without getting into the specifics of it, but it would make it, you know, constructed in a way that we would be able to, you know, limit the fire growth and cause it to be completely sprinkled.

941
01:40:55,654 --> 01:41:06,157
And like I said, we have our systems in there with elevators and standpipes and, you know, it's just a different way of fighting fire.

942
01:41:06,197 --> 01:41:13,960
You just, you know, you're less, you don't really need to have an aerial reach a roof on a high rise because you can get there through other means.

943
01:41:18,055 --> 01:41:25,677
Right, I assume, can you explain whether a building like this, obviously a building of this size is, you know, is sprinkled.

944
01:41:26,637 --> 01:41:32,859
Are there special systems that are installed for, you know, high rise lab?

945
01:41:32,879 --> 01:41:37,701
Okay, I would leave that to the engineers.

946
01:41:38,201 --> 01:41:38,741
Definitely.

947
01:41:40,301 --> 01:41:45,823
So the height of the building, I think will govern the different systems that go in there with the building code.

948
01:41:46,509 --> 01:41:52,912
and the life safety code, and when it, with the level of labs that are in there, they'd be required to do certain things on the code.

949
01:41:52,932 --> 01:42:01,656
So level one and two is the lesser of the, I guess it's one and two, and then three and four are the, it gets worse the higher the number goes.

950
01:42:02,297 --> 01:42:08,019
So, and I don't believe three and four was ever mentioned, it's just ones and twos, that's what they're talking about.

951
01:42:08,420 --> 01:42:12,902
So it's a lower risk than the higher number.

952
01:42:16,068 --> 01:42:20,233
Thank you, David and we do have the engineer from Jacobs on to I don't know if you want to touch on any of that.

953
01:42:21,354 --> 01:42:28,243
Well, I would just say that I don't think there's anything about the lab occupancy that changes the fire hazard in the building because of the.

954
01:42:29,772 --> 01:42:32,814
These are kind of, these are not high hazard labs.

955
01:42:34,235 --> 01:42:45,941
So, you know, basically the fire hazard and the kind of the stair widths and egress capacities are going to be based on occupancy, which is essentially a business occupancy.

956
01:42:46,162 --> 01:42:51,785
So I don't think there's anything about the lab function that makes the building more hazardous.

957
01:42:53,543 --> 01:42:59,954
So, there, you know, if we got to get into the weeds, there are, there is containment of,

958
01:43:01,845 --> 01:43:07,749
liquids and gases within the building that have to be carefully monitored and limited quantities.

959
01:43:08,569 --> 01:43:09,950
And that is prescribed by code.

960
01:43:09,990 --> 01:43:19,356
And as you get higher up in the building, you're allowed to have less open container of these potentially, you know, sensitive liquids and materials.

961
01:43:20,296 --> 01:43:28,021
But that's kind of a separate kind of issue about containment and storage of those materials.

962
01:43:28,602 --> 01:43:30,806
materials versus life safety for people.

963
01:43:31,387 --> 01:43:34,953
So that would be just, I hope that's helpful, my comment there.

964
01:43:36,396 --> 01:43:36,937
Yes, thank you.

965
01:43:38,910 --> 01:43:39,570
Thank you.

966
01:43:39,991 --> 01:43:43,693
I also wanted to ask what, where would you even put on the site?

967
01:43:44,994 --> 01:43:53,800
What I think would be the inevitable request from tenants to locate gas tanks of one sort or another, nitrogen, oxygen tanks.

968
01:43:54,981 --> 01:43:58,343
I think it's very common to see for a building of this size, I would imagine.

969
01:43:58,883 --> 01:44:01,765
Inevitably, you're gonna have three to six tanks, one to three tanks.

970
01:44:01,805 --> 01:44:06,048
There's gonna be some number of clients who will want to see that and use that.

971
01:44:08,347 --> 01:44:14,972
So oftentimes, that is sort of more point of use within a laboratory suite.

972
01:44:15,133 --> 01:44:18,736
And so that would be built into a lab of the fed out per floor.

973
01:44:18,756 --> 01:44:23,479
They will use smaller quantities, like in canisters, things like that.

974
01:44:23,579 --> 01:44:28,544
If the building is developed where there's more centralized supply of

975
01:44:29,493 --> 01:44:35,919
of gases like nitrogen or compressed air, that would be in a room within the core on the ground floor.

976
01:44:35,939 --> 01:44:45,347
It could be a place that you carve out either near the loading dock or even carved out of the parking garage in terms of the basement location.

977
01:44:46,088 --> 01:44:49,911
So that would mean that that would be part of the kind of core building amenity.

978
01:44:50,672 --> 01:45:01,835
for tenants, which is an option, or it's developed kind of more point of use and built into the fit out by tenant.

979
01:45:02,516 --> 01:45:08,518
So there wouldn't be any centralized kind of infrastructure for those gases.

980
01:45:11,498 --> 01:45:11,678
Okay.

981
01:45:12,379 --> 01:45:19,901
If someone could address too, the difficulty of this site, we have so many places in Medford where it's almost

982
01:45:21,443 --> 01:45:24,549
You get the one way this way, you get the one way that way.

983
01:45:24,629 --> 01:45:29,617
Try to get directions to someone from out of town to get to a location like this in Medford.

984
01:45:29,637 --> 01:45:30,599
It can be very difficult.

985
01:45:31,591 --> 01:45:38,654
And I guess I'm just trying, I'm a little skeptical about the accessibility currently for folks to get to the cafe.

986
01:45:39,394 --> 01:45:45,436
Is it really something that the community can take advantage of like how do I really even get there there's three parking spaces on site.

987
01:45:45,996 --> 01:45:53,059
Are they using the garage, the community space maybe you can just walk me through like what's the plan for the, for the public to be invited to the location.

988
01:45:53,739 --> 01:46:03,061
in its current configuration, putting aside the fact that maybe the parkway will be developed in a different way that will be more accessible up and down the line in the years ahead.

989
01:46:06,302 --> 01:46:08,702
So Quinlan, I don't know if you want to touch on that one.

990
01:46:08,722 --> 01:46:09,723
I'm happy to as well.

991
01:46:09,763 --> 01:46:16,004
I think the idea is that the cafe space is very public.

992
01:46:16,953 --> 01:46:25,737
I think what we're doing is we're really planning for reinforcing the pedestrian circulation along the edge of Mystic Valley Parkway.

993
01:46:25,777 --> 01:46:37,162
So I think there's a hope and a goal that we're planning for how this sort of area of the city is gonna develop and become more vibrant and more engaged.

994
01:46:37,242 --> 01:46:43,145
And I think providing more surface parking or more parking of any kind

995
01:46:44,462 --> 01:46:50,584
that's visible and accessible really kind of works against that, especially since we have such a tight piece of frontage there.

996
01:46:51,064 --> 01:46:53,404
So I think we do recognize there is some need.

997
01:46:54,645 --> 01:47:03,647
I think we're trying to be very deliberate that hopefully the use here is supported by the occupants of the building, the future occupants of development on either side.

998
01:47:04,245 --> 01:47:18,030
the strong pedestrian circulation along the leading edge of the street, and hopefully the development of that public plaza areas as a reinforcement to the park on the other side of Mystic Valley Parkway that could encourage people to come over.

999
01:47:18,711 --> 01:47:27,434
I'm not sure if that really answers your question, but I think we're really focused on making sure the cafe and the functionality of that space

1000
01:47:28,107 --> 01:47:30,970
has a strong connection with the way it's being designed.

1001
01:47:31,170 --> 01:47:39,818
And we don't sort of take the easy way out and just put a bunch of surface parking so it's easy so that Quinlan and his team can just get somebody in there.

1002
01:47:39,878 --> 01:47:43,882
We want it to be the right use in a way that makes sense for sort of long term planning.

1003
01:47:45,843 --> 01:47:51,969
I don't know if that answers your question, but that was sort of the genesis of how we were thinking about it as a team trying to be more holistic.

1004
01:47:54,251 --> 01:47:57,414
I appreciate the comment and I guess it's, it's worth.

1005
01:47:58,254 --> 01:48:08,523
I look, I liked hearing from you that the hey the cafe is going to be an amenity for the employees to build, which, you know, that's, that's probably, you know, the biggest driver of it.

1006
01:48:08,963 --> 01:48:18,271
And if it is a community amenity at the same time it's better for everyone to, but probably going to help you leave space and keep folks happy.

1007
01:48:19,572 --> 01:48:21,854
Come to work in the building that that makes a lot of sense.

1008
01:48:23,243 --> 01:48:24,563
I'm going to pass it back to you.

1009
01:48:24,583 --> 01:48:24,703
Andrea.

1010
01:48:24,783 --> 01:48:26,024
I'll pass it back to you.

1011
01:48:26,044 --> 01:48:27,764
Okay Can I just jump in for a second on that?

1012
01:48:29,105 --> 01:48:29,445
I think.

1013
01:48:30,205 --> 01:48:30,645
Brian.

1014
01:48:32,506 --> 01:48:36,187
Um what I'm sort of feeling, and I'm guessing this is sort of what David's feelings that.

1015
01:48:38,088 --> 01:48:39,308
There's something about.

1016
01:48:40,608 --> 01:48:42,349
The cafe and.

1017
01:48:43,329 --> 01:48:43,729
The public

1018
01:48:52,836 --> 01:49:03,318
You know, putting these sort of amenities or retail spaces in a building is is like super important but it just feels like the retail spaces like.

1019
01:49:05,017 --> 01:49:07,199
I don't know that I have an answer to that.

1020
01:49:07,219 --> 01:49:09,260
I initially I was sort of wondering if it was bigger space.

1021
01:49:09,300 --> 01:49:12,343
I'm a little unconvinced by the community space as well.

1022
01:49:12,363 --> 01:49:13,464
I was wondering if there was

1023
01:49:36,734 --> 01:49:38,775
maybe it's a combination of the two.

1024
01:49:39,216 --> 01:49:47,000
Um, I don't know, but it just seems like a tiny little cafe is going to do little to activate the ground floor.

1025
01:49:48,300 --> 01:49:55,924
Other than for people in the building, you know, and we all know that that probably won't sustain a business in that location.

1026
01:49:56,865 --> 01:49:58,505
Um.

1027
01:49:58,525 --> 01:50:00,927
I. Maybe this is more of a question.

1028
01:50:06,833 --> 01:50:20,983
this may be a question for Victor or others from the town, but I do feel like along the same thread of, you know, like, what's, is there sort of like a master plan for the site?

1029
01:50:21,023 --> 01:50:22,604
You've sort of gotten the answer on that.

1030
01:50:23,004 --> 01:50:31,270
But I do wonder if there could possibly be sort of a master plan for the open space along the parkway on that side of the road.

1031
01:50:31,450 --> 01:50:34,352
Like, is it, um,

1032
01:50:35,737 --> 01:50:47,474
You know, we talked about those those strange parking spaces where you know the cop cars park in front of the courthouse, but it's kind of a turn lane but it's, it's just, it's, it's.

1033
01:50:48,135 --> 01:50:49,717
And I wonder if that should.

1034
01:50:50,568 --> 01:51:03,822
all be sort of rethought holistically, you know, I would love I think I think it would work great is to see a protected bike lane in that location away from the parkway because people drive much too fast there for for biking adjacent to the road.

1035
01:51:04,683 --> 01:51:12,571
I think, you know, just thinking of that street section and how we could, again, maybe this project is a, is a, you know,

1036
01:51:13,971 --> 01:51:32,531
an example of how of how we'd like the rest of that, of that strip of road to be to be handled but I'd love to see like a street section where we talk about, you know, there's, there's a bike lane zone and pedestrian zone planting zone and it's just, it's really thought through and then that could be sort of implemented on, you know,

1037
01:51:34,572 --> 01:51:37,433
all the way down to Wegmans and towards Wellington.

1038
01:51:37,653 --> 01:51:43,994
I think that would be maybe a really nice way to sort of start the development in this area.

1039
01:51:44,074 --> 01:51:53,776
Because I do think that parkways, it's a really nice area, the sidewalks now are pitiful, and it could be way better.

1040
01:51:53,816 --> 01:52:03,198
And I think the development of an active strip like that would actually really go a long way in activating, drawing people out along that edge.

1041
01:52:06,980 --> 01:52:22,148
I'm just going to say you don't, you know, we know that you're under the weather, not expecting you to, to hang on here we're going to be continuing this till another meeting so don't feel obligated please to, to keep participating at this time.

1042
01:52:25,290 --> 01:52:27,311
Thank you for the out chair.

1043
01:52:27,351 --> 01:52:28,071
I appreciate it.

1044
01:52:29,352 --> 01:52:32,934
Yeah, I just wanted to say that I agree with class and there's.

1045
01:52:35,751 --> 01:52:37,072
There is thought going into that.

1046
01:52:37,172 --> 01:52:43,896
Maybe Todd can speak a little bit to some of the planning that's happened in this area from a transportation perspective.

1047
01:52:44,476 --> 01:53:00,906
But yes, I love to see this project be a model and bring some new thought to how that street can function, because it clearly doesn't function well for residents that live there or people that are visiting that area for whatever reason.

1048
01:53:04,028 --> 01:53:04,308
Thank you.

1049
01:53:06,929 --> 01:53:23,359
So I think we've heard from a number of the board members some things that we'd like to see some more details on, particularly perspectives and renderings to give a better sense of the edges of the site and how it's experienced by folks on the ground.

1050
01:53:24,060 --> 01:53:31,345
One thing that I will say in terms of my own comments, this is an interesting location.

1051
01:53:31,425 --> 01:53:33,966
I think it's a challenging location in that

1052
01:53:35,707 --> 01:53:55,406
It's certainly a place that's appropriate for density, being so close to mass transit and an already heavily developed and circulated area around Wellington, but at the same time it's part of a parkway across from a river and parks and bikeways.

1053
01:53:56,227 --> 01:53:57,068
And I think that

1054
01:53:58,695 --> 01:54:14,429
getting this project right, as a lot of the other board members have said is going to be important to this board, in that it's going to set a precedent for development along that edge of the street so I think when we come back next time if you could think about some of these things a little bit more.

1055
01:54:16,707 --> 01:54:26,311
As Chris said, you know how, what kinds of improvements of street treatments, you know, would be appropriate for that side of route 16.

1056
01:54:26,351 --> 01:54:30,813
If I agree a protected bike lane would be terrific.

1057
01:54:32,694 --> 01:54:40,377
you know, but then we're balancing, you know, is there a dedicated lane for, you know, shuttles or buses to, you know, or places for them to pull over?

1058
01:54:40,717 --> 01:54:43,918
So if you could think a little bit about that, that would be great.

1059
01:54:44,499 --> 01:55:00,485
One of the concerns that I have, I think just about the, you know, the massing that's come up a couple of times has been, you're looking for, you know, only 10 feet of width to the property line on either side.

1060
01:55:02,988 --> 01:55:07,691
That's about what I have in my two family house next door.

1061
01:55:08,271 --> 01:55:15,235
So that's very tight and I'm not certain that it's really appropriate for a parkway.

1062
01:55:15,275 --> 01:55:26,782
I'd be concerned if every other property that came in to be redeveloped along that route would be expecting the same thing, in which case you'd have

1063
01:55:27,222 --> 01:55:34,997
a number of high rises very close together, which I don't think is appropriate for the parkway, you know, and

1064
01:55:35,736 --> 01:55:39,659
So if you could think about that a little bit more it's not necessarily I think this board.

1065
01:55:40,439 --> 01:55:50,287
You know, we have been so definitely supportive of of density of reducing parking of walkability of mixing uses.

1066
01:55:50,927 --> 01:55:58,953
So I think we're excited about this project I think we like the start that you've made here, I personally

1067
01:56:00,243 --> 01:56:20,537
I'd like to see a rendering of it, but I think I like the plaza and the front, you know, and I do like having some kind of activity along there so that people walking from Wellington, especially in the evening or during the winter when there's, it's dark, there is more kind of a little bit more lighting and activity.

1068
01:56:21,058 --> 01:56:27,922
But, you know, on this issue of balancing that dense development with

1069
01:56:28,843 --> 01:56:31,125
the natural resources that are surrounding it.

1070
01:56:31,705 --> 01:56:41,672
You know, it's on the rear of the building is this, what really is probably the last remaining urban wild of any significant size in Medford.

1071
01:56:42,292 --> 01:56:45,475
And while I think the future of that parcel is up in the air.

1072
01:56:45,895 --> 01:56:53,860
I certainly know as someone who lives in that area and is by, you know, the parks on either side or walking to Wellington, you know,

1073
01:56:55,633 --> 01:56:57,174
So I'm very familiar with how that is.

1074
01:56:57,234 --> 01:56:59,036
I know there's actually a lot of wildlife.

1075
01:56:59,096 --> 01:57:07,322
I mean, I see coyotes crossing, you know, numerous times back and forth between the river and that area.

1076
01:57:07,442 --> 01:57:10,404
And they always cut through the Bertucci's parking lot.

1077
01:57:11,285 --> 01:57:14,207
So the way that I feel like this building,

1078
01:57:16,372 --> 01:57:20,055
feel like this building is pretty much a wall between those two natural areas.

1079
01:57:20,155 --> 01:57:40,174
And I, I certainly wish that there would be more of a kind of a green zone, at least some strips of connection that would permit, you know, animals to move forward so that they're, you know, back and forth, so that they're, you know, functional ecosystems.

1080
01:57:41,255 --> 01:57:41,395
And

1081
01:57:43,305 --> 01:57:49,390
And I think in general, again, being a parkway, I like the fact that you're keeping trees, you're adding a tree to the front.

1082
01:57:49,810 --> 01:57:53,793
I wish there would be some more room for trees along the sides.

1083
01:57:56,755 --> 01:58:10,166
So I guess thinking a little bit more about the massing and if you have any additional thoughts about that or ways of mitigating it would be certainly welcome to me and probably other board members.

1084
01:58:12,265 --> 01:58:28,901
I think Andre, that's a really good point, and I, and I, I want to just second that I, I feel like part of the issue may be the width and I think you said it right that like this building is coming very close to the sides.

1085
01:58:32,641 --> 01:58:37,125
you're also going for a variance on, you know, a lot of the other metrics.

1086
01:58:37,866 --> 01:58:56,282
So I, I got to think that there's a way to make the building a little less wide, and either, you know, taller or deeper or something like that, where, where you could you could make up that kind of square footage, but still get the sort of massing relief that I think the site merits.

1087
01:58:57,063 --> 01:58:58,264
I know there's, you know, sort of

1088
01:58:59,543 --> 01:59:05,388
bay widths and all that that you hold to in planning but I would think about that as well.

1089
01:59:06,669 --> 01:59:22,101
Given that you know you're going for, you know, all these variances anyway I think, you know, if you could solve for some of the things that are most important as it as it relates to the, the way the building sits on the site I think that that could be important.

1090
01:59:22,181 --> 01:59:25,704
I appreciate that.

1091
01:59:31,518 --> 01:59:31,798
Thank you.

1092
01:59:31,818 --> 01:59:43,164
So unless actually I should invite, I don't think there are, but if there are any members of the public who would like to comment, I do want to give them the opportunity to speak.

1093
01:59:44,284 --> 01:59:45,705
Amanda, I don't know if you have anybody.

1094
01:59:47,781 --> 01:59:56,784
I don't yet, and maybe we'll just give a moment to folks, if anybody wants to raise their hands, there's the reaction button, or you could message.

1095
01:59:56,804 --> 02:00:04,387
I'm just gonna check now for any emails, which we haven't received.

1096
02:00:06,584 --> 02:00:10,906
Well, why don't we give a couple of minutes in case members of the public do want to weigh in.

1097
02:00:11,106 --> 02:00:16,229
And in the meantime, I know Commissioner Blake, you look like you were gonna say something a little while ago.

1098
02:00:16,289 --> 02:00:17,490
Would you like to comment?

1099
02:00:18,498 --> 02:00:35,108
So just quickly I want to mention to places comment and yours as well, regarding a plea to the board and the proponent please don't feel limited to my mitigation recommendation number two that suggested the concept of the bike lane in the shoulders with paint only.

1100
02:00:35,729 --> 02:00:37,630
That was mostly a short midterm.

1101
02:00:38,210 --> 02:00:43,314
you know solution to connect a lot of points that we're connecting in Medford for bicyclists.

1102
02:00:44,235 --> 02:00:54,964
The long term vision could definitely be what places suggested so when, when, if and when it gets approved a condition to include that don't feel limited look at all the cross sections.

1103
02:00:56,145 --> 02:00:59,267
I will say that on DCL parkways and mass dot roadways.

1104
02:01:00,288 --> 02:01:08,133
elsewhere in the region for instance in Arlington is looking at a connection between mystic area and minimum.

1105
02:01:08,694 --> 02:01:16,719
And, you know, it, there is, it's a longer process that would extend probably beyond the life of the approval process for this one project.

1106
02:01:17,360 --> 02:01:24,405
So, so it usually starts with this feasibility study, then it goes into design after, you know, and then and then construction so.

1107
02:01:25,045 --> 02:01:35,074
But that that could very well be the long term vision of both sides of Mr. Kelly Parkway as well just like what's going on in Arlington near the Mystic River to Minuteman area so.

1108
02:01:35,775 --> 02:01:40,500
So just, yeah, that was all just don't feel limited by that suggestion.

1109
02:01:41,981 --> 02:01:44,623
Open to any and all bicycle improvements in the area.

1110
02:01:48,040 --> 02:01:48,781
Thank you, Commissioner.

1111
02:01:49,201 --> 02:01:49,721
Thanks.

1112
02:01:49,822 --> 02:01:50,082
One thing.

1113
02:01:51,123 --> 02:01:54,806
One thing we haven't touched on that I will ask when we have a minute waiting.

1114
02:01:56,567 --> 02:02:04,895
We haven't talked about noise and I'm wondering whether you could speak a little bit about that what might the noise levels be around this building.

1115
02:02:08,150 --> 02:02:10,112
also getting back to that light issue.

1116
02:02:10,172 --> 02:02:28,826
I think in terms of my comment about balancing that kind of density, that bringing people into the space with respecting the parkway and the natural areas around it, I don't know what's the best design solution, but if you could think about that a little bit more, I'm a little concerned about noise pollution and light pollution from the site.

1117
02:02:31,763 --> 02:02:32,223
Yeah, thank you.

1118
02:02:32,243 --> 02:02:34,985
I think I cube three and Jacobs could probably take most of that.

1119
02:02:35,005 --> 02:02:38,547
I know there is a lighting plan that was in place by MDLA.

1120
02:02:38,587 --> 02:02:40,728
I'm not sure if no, I think they're still on here as well.

1121
02:02:40,789 --> 02:02:42,169
So they could speak to that.

1122
02:02:42,209 --> 02:02:46,332
And I think Jacobs could probably add a little bit more detail to the noise as well.

1123
02:02:50,750 --> 02:02:53,530
So I'm happy to jump, I'm happy to jump in on noise.

1124
02:02:53,671 --> 02:03:17,235
I mean, the beautiful thing about the, in the penthouses, the way that they're being accommodated is that they are, they are enclosed mechanical units rights and spaces so that those there's an, there's an ability to acoustically contain the mechanical equipment so that the noise transmission to the neighborhood should be minimized, very minimal.

1125
02:03:18,255 --> 02:03:19,035
So as again,

1126
02:03:19,700 --> 02:03:24,324
rather than having a lot of exposed mechanical equipment on the roof, it's behind an acoustical barrier.

1127
02:03:26,465 --> 02:03:38,154
So, and, you know, in terms of the units themselves, they would all be rated to minimize any, you know, vibration or noise that would be, you know, audible within the neighborhood.

1128
02:03:38,174 --> 02:03:47,321
So I think that's probably a, would be a limited, a very limited concern about noise and, you know, in terms of other activities on the ground floor,

1129
02:03:47,990 --> 02:03:50,391
I can't think of anything, the loading dock is contained.

1130
02:03:52,312 --> 02:03:54,433
So I think noise should not be an issue.

1131
02:03:54,553 --> 02:04:11,260
And again, I'll defer to keep three on this, but in terms of site lighting design, obviously we'd be aware of the city of Medford standards and also kind of dark sky kind of criteria.

1132
02:04:12,101 --> 02:04:15,682
Yeah, I think we'll be managing that closely as the design moves forward.

1133
02:04:15,702 --> 02:04:16,643
I think again,

1134
02:04:17,868 --> 02:04:22,531
objectives is not to illuminate the building but really reinforce the public realm.

1135
02:04:22,671 --> 02:04:26,694
That's going to be the primary objective.

1136
02:04:27,295 --> 02:04:29,076
This is Mike Rettenmayer from MDLA.

1137
02:04:29,636 --> 02:04:33,399
We did provide a photometrics plan for the site lighting.

1138
02:04:34,280 --> 02:04:45,848
So along the perimeter drive, we are including wall-mounted lights that are cut off so there's no spill over the property line along the perimeter, but that does safely eliminate any walkways

1139
02:04:46,622 --> 02:04:48,223
the drive surface around the perimeter.

1140
02:04:48,663 --> 02:04:56,447
And then for the entry plaza, we're including low-level bollard lights to illuminate some of that pedestrian circulation.

1141
02:04:56,527 --> 02:05:06,192
And there's some decorative light poles that highlight the main circulation to the entry lobby and the cafe space, again, all safely illuminating that entire plaza.

1142
02:05:06,733 --> 02:05:11,175
And then along the parkway, there's some existing Cobra head lighting that

1143
02:05:12,058 --> 02:05:15,959
are not, we don't have that fact in our photometrics, but those are existing.

1144
02:05:15,999 --> 02:05:26,881
And so, we're not messing with any of the light levels at the parkway, but providing appropriate lighting at our curb cuts and things like that.

1145
02:05:34,022 --> 02:05:36,362
Amanda, I don't see any comments or raised hands.

1146
02:05:37,142 --> 02:05:37,922
Have you gotten anything?

1147
02:05:37,942 --> 02:05:39,223
I have not.

1148
02:05:40,323 --> 02:05:41,223
Okay, great.

1149
02:05:42,670 --> 02:05:54,557
Well, hopefully this has provided a little bit of direction in terms of our interests and where you might be able to help us provide some more details about the project.

1150
02:05:55,498 --> 02:06:01,021
We really appreciate you and your whole project team's time tonight.

1151
02:06:01,041 --> 02:06:04,143
So thank you for that.

1152
02:06:04,163 --> 02:06:07,805
I think I would entertain a motion to continue

1153
02:06:10,925 --> 02:06:14,668
And I think we have to, Amanda, do we have a possible date?

1154
02:06:16,430 --> 02:06:17,871
Yeah, so I apologize.

1155
02:06:17,911 --> 02:06:27,019
I should have asked you guys ahead of time to vet a couple of dates, but I think maybe the first question I have will be for the proponent team.

1156
02:06:27,920 --> 02:06:36,587
In general, what would allow for like enough time to kind of thoroughly respond to some of the feedback you heard tonight?

1157
02:06:41,040 --> 02:06:47,224
Yeah, we can have responses drawn up as soon as you guys are ready to have another hearing.

1158
02:06:47,244 --> 02:06:54,648
I don't think there's any concern with getting anything prepared for you guys, another presentation to answer some of these questions.

1159
02:06:54,728 --> 02:07:01,993
So whatever time the board needs to kind of take this in and schedule another meeting, we'll be ready by then.

1160
02:07:02,953 --> 02:07:03,214
Okay.

1161
02:07:04,675 --> 02:07:09,177
So then I guess back to board members, would we,

1162
02:07:10,760 --> 02:07:14,621
Is, would we do two weeks or look further out?

1163
02:07:14,661 --> 02:07:16,121
I mean, June 1st or 2nd?

1164
02:07:18,282 --> 02:07:21,823
Andre, I am very not available June 1st.

1165
02:07:21,903 --> 02:07:25,064
It's Medford High graduation and I have twins graduating.

1166
02:07:26,524 --> 02:07:28,605
And Thursday's the rain date for it.

1167
02:07:29,365 --> 02:07:30,906
So I hesitate.

1168
02:07:30,926 --> 02:07:36,047
I know the board doesn't revolve around me, but theoretically I should be here.

1169
02:07:39,725 --> 02:07:42,786
I feel like we should, this should be more like three to four weeks out.

1170
02:07:46,248 --> 02:07:52,550
So how about the following week starts June 6th is the Monday.

1171
02:07:55,451 --> 02:08:04,934
How do folks feel about either, you know, we usually do Tuesdays or Wednesdays, or sorry, not Tuesdays, Wednesdays or Thursdays.

1172
02:08:05,375 --> 02:08:06,075
So that would be the,

1173
02:08:07,058 --> 02:08:09,980
the 8th or the 9th?

1174
02:08:11,540 --> 02:08:20,165
And it doesn't revolve around me either, Amanda, but Wednesdays are the days that are harder for me to get here.

1175
02:08:21,165 --> 02:08:25,407
Yeah, I have a conflict that Wednesday as well, but Thursday the 9th would work.

1176
02:08:30,010 --> 02:08:31,130
Does that work for others?

1177
02:08:32,571 --> 02:08:33,471
Do the 9th as well.

1178
02:08:35,872 --> 02:08:36,932
Christy's nodding yes.

1179
02:08:37,653 --> 02:08:38,213
Great.

1180
02:08:38,793 --> 02:08:45,235
I'm just going to check the city calendar on the fly here just to make sure that there's nothing glaring.

1181
02:08:45,976 --> 02:08:58,360
Yep, I did the historic district commission is meeting that night so that's not a big deal for us, and there's a another group is having an interview party so great DNA said you could do it as well.

1182
02:08:59,500 --> 02:09:01,021
Yeah, it looks like everybody can then.

1183
02:09:01,181 --> 02:09:01,401
Okay.

1184
02:09:08,680 --> 02:09:14,544
All right, so I will entertain a motion to continue the hearing till Thursday, June 9th.

1185
02:09:14,604 --> 02:09:17,125
Is there a motion on the floor?

1186
02:09:17,145 --> 02:09:25,051
I'd like to make a motion to continue our hearing until June 9th at 6 p.m.

1187
02:09:26,472 --> 02:09:27,372
Thank you, is there a second?

1188
02:09:28,053 --> 02:09:28,653
I will second.

1189
02:09:29,714 --> 02:09:30,354
Thank you, Klaas.

1190
02:09:31,475 --> 02:09:32,115
Roll call vote.

1191
02:09:32,415 --> 02:09:32,996
Christy Dowd?

1192
02:09:34,197 --> 02:09:34,417
Yes.

1193
02:09:35,778 --> 02:09:36,518
Klaas Andresen?

1194
02:09:37,519 --> 02:09:37,579
Aye.

1195
02:09:38,636 --> 02:09:39,416
Jackie Furtado?

1196
02:09:40,097 --> 02:09:40,357
Yes.

1197
02:09:41,557 --> 02:09:42,257
David Blumberg?

1198
02:09:42,978 --> 02:09:43,178
Yes.

1199
02:09:44,058 --> 02:09:44,718
Deanna Peabody?

1200
02:09:45,599 --> 02:09:45,759
Aye.

1201
02:09:46,859 --> 02:09:48,800
And I'm an aye as well.

1202
02:09:49,060 --> 02:09:55,003
So the hearing is continued to Thursday, June 9th at 6 p.m.

1203
02:09:57,024 --> 02:09:58,024
Thank you very much, everybody.

1204
02:09:58,504 --> 02:10:00,405
Mr. Chair, members of the board, thank you so much.

1205
02:10:00,985 --> 02:10:01,385
Thank you.

1206
02:10:01,966 --> 02:10:02,946
Really appreciate your time.

1207
02:10:09,342 --> 02:10:17,211
All right, next item on the agenda is just I think miscellaneous so I don't know if Amanda or Alicia you have anything you want to bring to our attention.

1208
02:10:22,433 --> 02:10:33,341
this may sound like I'm repeating myself from last meeting, but the Great American Beer Hall community meeting was actually rescheduled to this Thursday at 5 p.m.

1209
02:10:33,481 --> 02:10:34,262
It'll be virtual.

1210
02:10:34,562 --> 02:10:38,345
This is for the site proposed for 142 Mystic Ave.

1211
02:10:38,946 --> 02:10:48,213
Again, no obligation for board members to be there, but just wanted to put it on your radar, and we feel that this is a project that may be coming to us soon.

1212
02:10:49,614 --> 02:10:49,774
Um.

1213
02:10:50,615 --> 02:10:52,696
Wanted to mention that and.

1214
02:10:54,017 --> 02:10:55,098
Just one other thing.

1215
02:10:55,118 --> 02:11:08,008
I will send out an email this week, um, about, uh, collecting some signatures from folks for we have a couple of past minutes that can be signed off on and then.

1216
02:11:08,908 --> 02:11:10,229
The Mylar's for the

1217
02:11:19,397 --> 02:11:21,220
yeah, have that on your awareness.

1218
02:11:22,121 --> 02:11:25,587
So you'll send us like times we can come in by email, right?

1219
02:11:25,907 --> 02:11:26,428
Yes.

1220
02:11:26,568 --> 02:11:26,769
Yes.

1221
02:11:26,969 --> 02:11:27,209
Great.

1222
02:11:28,652 --> 02:11:31,957
Anything else, Alicia, that you wanted to throw in?

1223
02:11:34,061 --> 02:11:37,545
I was just saying the things that are on my radar are around the comprehensive plan.

1224
02:11:37,585 --> 02:11:39,768
And we just discussed that with this board.

1225
02:11:40,148 --> 02:11:52,323
And so that I'll just say in case we haven't lost every single member of the public, that the comp plan consultants will be at Circle the Square on Saturday, June 18, to talk to people.

1226
02:11:54,142 --> 02:12:05,084
The other fun thing, we're moving along for a Morrison Park redesign, and we were in the final stages and decided to go out for more public comment on swings.

1227
02:12:05,644 --> 02:12:08,144
Anybody's passionate about swing layouts?

1228
02:12:08,745 --> 02:12:11,945
Amanda is probably about, what time is it?

1229
02:12:12,345 --> 02:12:22,267
Probably about 14 hours from sharing with the public a survey about the swing layout at Morrison Park before we move to

1230
02:12:23,631 --> 02:12:27,533
But you're going to say there was 14 hours of public comment on swing layout.

1231
02:12:28,054 --> 02:12:37,860
No, we got the draft survey today and we were too busy prepping for this meeting to actually release that survey to the public, but it's a survey just about swings.

1232
02:12:40,021 --> 02:12:40,221
Right.

1233
02:12:40,281 --> 02:12:47,565
And we don't have, Amanda or Alicia, we don't have a date, right, for the comp plan to be presented to this board.

1234
02:12:47,886 --> 02:12:48,266
Is that right?

1235
02:12:49,175 --> 02:12:54,565
Not yet, but I should get an email out to you guys and we can start scheduling for that.

1236
02:12:55,546 --> 02:12:56,408
Okay.

1237
02:12:56,468 --> 02:12:58,792
Are we thinking June or?

1238
02:13:00,573 --> 02:13:09,760
Um, I guess it kind of depends a bit on how like at what phase and I have to refer back to my notes because I feel like we talked about this last meeting, so I apologize.

1239
02:13:10,120 --> 02:13:21,748
Um, like if you guys want to be hearing about kind of nearly finished draft version of the plan versus like Finished draft, which would be later in the summer.

1240
02:13:23,850 --> 02:13:26,652
I think we said they wanted to hear earlier.

1241
02:13:26,672 --> 02:13:26,752
Okay.

1242
02:13:28,213 --> 02:13:28,293
Um,

1243
02:13:30,049 --> 02:13:31,509
rather than at the very end.

1244
02:13:31,630 --> 02:13:34,871
And that was the idea, was to weigh in sooner.

1245
02:13:34,891 --> 02:13:37,451
I will apologize.

1246
02:13:37,551 --> 02:13:43,793
I have been keeping Amanda super busy with projects that she hasn't reached out about that yet.

1247
02:13:43,813 --> 02:13:50,375
I just was curious so that the members know we're in the timeline where we're talking.

1248
02:13:51,216 --> 02:13:53,216
Okay, we'll expect an email about that.

1249
02:13:53,977 --> 02:13:56,077
And I know, well, David, is this about that?

1250
02:13:56,097 --> 02:13:58,278
Because I know Jackie had her hand up too, was gonna speak.

1251
02:13:59,375 --> 02:14:00,336
Jackie first please.

1252
02:14:02,558 --> 02:14:09,965
So I just wanted to clarify the Bear Hall project meeting, the community meeting is that at the same time as the steering committee meeting this Thursday.

1253
02:14:11,026 --> 02:14:14,209
It's at 5pm so it's a little earlier.

1254
02:14:14,229 --> 02:14:15,330
Okay, so that's it.

1255
02:14:15,450 --> 02:14:16,491
Okay, thank you.

1256
02:14:20,019 --> 02:14:24,084
A couple items, one rules and regs I think we do need to approve rules and regs.

1257
02:14:24,685 --> 02:14:31,492
And I think we've gotten very close to it, looking at the ordinance briefly today in preparation for this meeting.

1258
02:14:31,512 --> 02:14:37,680
I think it even says we shall adopt them so probably incumbent on us to do that.

1259
02:14:39,936 --> 02:14:43,779
I know it's not a headliner of an item but didn't want to lose sight of it.

1260
02:14:44,820 --> 02:15:00,354
Second thing, along the similar lines, the vacancy on the board, and the associate member of the board, and maybe third in a three part question, the extension of some of the terms of current board members.

1261
02:15:02,895 --> 02:15:22,531
So I can take the, we had a conversation about a couple of candidates for, sorry, for the current vacancy, and those folks have gone to the mayor for kind of, we're gonna do an initial vetting and then bring her in.

1262
02:15:23,571 --> 02:15:26,854
So hoping to have news for you guys soon on that front.

1263
02:15:29,377 --> 02:15:48,352
And in terms of extensions for existing members, maybe, I don't know if that's, if we should maybe talk offline to folks whose terms are coming up just about kind of, yeah, like where their interest in availability is there and what expectations are.

1264
02:15:49,073 --> 02:15:52,536
So definitely can get that going.

1265
02:15:54,097 --> 02:16:00,541
And will the city move forward filling the associate member role the newly created one by way of the ordinance?

1266
02:16:01,041 --> 02:16:03,082
Is that also on the on your hit list?

1267
02:16:03,962 --> 02:16:05,023
If you said it, I didn't hear it.

1268
02:16:05,083 --> 02:16:05,423
I'm sorry.

1269
02:16:05,663 --> 02:16:06,364
No, that's okay.

1270
02:16:06,624 --> 02:16:07,985
It's I think that will

1271
02:16:08,985 --> 02:16:11,567
could be a conversation moving forward.

1272
02:16:11,587 --> 02:16:30,459
I wanna say that our priority right now is to fill the current vacancy and to have an understanding of, I think there are two member terms, so Andre and Deanna that are coming up that will, yeah, need to take precedent.

1273
02:16:31,258 --> 02:16:40,784
Um, but if the board has ideas or preferences on kind of prioritizing, feel free to let me know.

1274
02:16:40,804 --> 02:16:45,047
We will be doing a push out for these various seats.

1275
02:16:46,728 --> 02:16:49,250
or they've already been pushed out, but we'll continue to do so.

1276
02:16:50,011 --> 02:17:01,079
And we're hoping that we'll get, as a result, continue to get candidates and applications, and so can have an eye as we're going through those to a potential associate member.

1277
02:17:01,099 --> 02:17:13,768
And I think there are some good potential candidates, but if there are other folks that any of you know who you think would be good,

1278
02:17:14,835 --> 02:17:16,855
you can still encourage them to apply.

1279
02:17:17,836 --> 02:17:20,636
Be good to have as big a pool as possible.

1280
02:17:22,497 --> 02:17:35,619
Yeah, in fact, if it's of interest, I could send, there's like a small blurb that the city's put out for promotion of the vacant seat now that would be used for any vacant seats that come up.

1281
02:17:36,160 --> 02:17:41,501
So I could share that with the board and you should feel free to circulate within your networks as well.

1282
02:17:42,221 --> 02:17:42,701
That'd be great.

1283
02:17:45,098 --> 02:18:06,478
Andre I quickly, I realized I, I've spoken to Alicia and the mayor about this but um, so I was reappointed by the governor, as of March 3, actually as of February so I have a new three year extension until 2025 and I was sworn in on March 3, and I just realized I neglected to share that with the board.

1284
02:18:06,498 --> 02:18:08,600
Right, thank you.

1285
02:18:08,660 --> 02:18:09,461
Congratulations.

1286
02:18:09,801 --> 02:18:10,182
Thank you.

1287
02:18:11,771 --> 02:18:16,180
I just wanted to clarify in the calendar because there was something I think there was some confusion.

1288
02:18:16,641 --> 02:18:19,988
The comprehensive plan steering committee Jackie's meeting Wednesday.

1289
02:18:20,802 --> 02:18:21,402
A Wednesday.

1290
02:18:21,562 --> 02:18:21,942
Okay.

1291
02:18:21,982 --> 02:18:22,463
Thank you.

1292
02:18:22,903 --> 02:18:26,524
The great American beer hall is Thursday at five.

1293
02:18:27,004 --> 02:18:32,787
There's also, um, I think I'd mentioned to you all that the MBTA bus routes that that network.

1294
02:18:33,467 --> 02:18:36,268
Um, so they actually released the draft network.

1295
02:18:36,448 --> 02:18:39,929
There's a meeting Thursday night for the public, the greater boss.

1296
02:18:40,009 --> 02:18:41,770
It's not a Medford specific meeting.

1297
02:18:42,650 --> 02:18:47,072
Um, and those bus routes, the drafts are now out there.

1298
02:18:47,132 --> 02:18:49,073
They really need people to comment on them.

1299
02:18:49,611 --> 02:18:51,652
I highly encourage people to look at it.

1300
02:18:52,213 --> 02:19:01,439
The interactive map is pretty, it's pretty helpful, I think, because you can like hover over a route and it'll highlight the route for you so you can see them.

1301
02:19:03,420 --> 02:19:08,323
I am actually gonna forward this specific, Amanda, it's much easier for me.

1302
02:19:08,343 --> 02:19:10,144
Can I send it to you and you send it to the board?

1303
02:19:10,544 --> 02:19:13,766
Because Amanda has you all as a shortcut and I would have to go find.

1304
02:19:13,786 --> 02:19:16,688
Go ahead.

1305
02:19:18,762 --> 02:19:21,424
So an email went out today about this.

1306
02:19:22,145 --> 02:19:30,251
That is the map, the remix map, a network planning tool, a static map.

1307
02:19:30,772 --> 02:19:36,816
And then there are ways that you can provide feedback, including they have an online feedback form in many languages.

1308
02:19:37,357 --> 02:19:42,081
They have a phone number and you can email written, you can mail written comments.

1309
02:19:42,581 --> 02:19:44,322
And then there's going to be some meetings.

1310
02:19:44,362 --> 02:19:47,265
The one this Thursday is a system-wide meeting.

1311
02:19:48,926 --> 02:19:59,012
there's gonna be one that includes Medford that is considered the, that's actually the inner core meeting on June 16th.

1312
02:19:59,692 --> 02:20:03,555
However, Medford's in a weird place relative to the MBTA.

1313
02:20:04,015 --> 02:20:11,479
This is in the message, but when you look at the names of the meetings, the one that's Mystic River and North Shore doesn't mention Medford.

1314
02:20:11,539 --> 02:20:13,501
It's kind of more our neighbors to the north.

1315
02:20:14,902 --> 02:20:16,523
But there's a lot of overlap.

1316
02:20:17,024 --> 02:20:25,251
And then there's one Minuteman in Metro North that's sort of our neighbors to the west, like Arlington Winchester, but it includes overlap with Medford.

1317
02:20:25,672 --> 02:20:28,695
So there are a bunch of meetings, you just want to look at this stuff yourself.

1318
02:20:29,695 --> 02:20:32,338
But I encourage you- I dropped in the link into the chat.

1319
02:20:33,179 --> 02:20:33,519
Great.

1320
02:20:34,200 --> 02:20:35,301
It's a really

1321
02:20:36,754 --> 02:20:42,055
I can't stress enough the need to really hear from people about this.

1322
02:20:42,576 --> 02:20:47,717
Todd and I can't just speak for the whole community on this, although we've given them some feedback.

1323
02:20:49,397 --> 02:20:52,398
But we really need to hear how this will really impact people.

1324
02:20:53,578 --> 02:20:56,459
We lost bus routes with the pandemic and they haven't come back.

1325
02:20:57,433 --> 02:20:57,653
Right.

1326
02:20:57,853 --> 02:21:00,954
I will tell you that the one that we've talked to them.

1327
02:21:01,395 --> 02:21:02,835
Well we've talked to them about a number of routes.

1328
02:21:03,175 --> 02:21:14,560
There was one that we've talked a lot about it is 710 the one that used to go through North Medford, and they had been running a shuttle basically what they've based, they've said is the MBT.

1329
02:21:15,630 --> 02:21:17,632
buses are too big for Fulton Heights.

1330
02:21:18,733 --> 02:21:29,004
So this new proposal has bus routes on either side on Elm and Highland and Felsway and not one up through the middle.

1331
02:21:29,465 --> 02:21:36,673
And what we need to keep pushing for is a smaller physical bus and that's not in their model right now.

1332
02:21:37,533 --> 02:21:38,854
to go in the middle of that.

1333
02:21:39,814 --> 02:21:54,319
The others are the express buses and that's something that they're kind of presenting is that they're creating a lot of what they consider rapid transit buses, where they're going to run more often than every 15 minutes and Medford's going to get a couple of those.

1334
02:21:55,379 --> 02:22:00,501
So they're not planning to bring down back the routes that just shoot down the highway to Haymarket.

1335
02:22:01,661 --> 02:22:11,105
But there's actually one that goes every 15 minutes from Medford Square through Sullivan Square to Kendall Square, which is an interesting change.

1336
02:22:12,245 --> 02:22:22,809
And they're sort of saying, if you're going to downtown Boston, you should take one of the many routes that'll go to Wellington and then hop on the Orange Line into downtown Boston.

1337
02:22:23,229 --> 02:22:25,210
That's kind of been their answer to us on that.

1338
02:22:26,808 --> 02:22:36,275
So we shouldn't, let's, I know it's been already kind of late and I think we encourage everybody to go to the website and check it out.

1339
02:22:37,976 --> 02:22:44,080
And I think we will accept a motion to adjourn.

1340
02:22:46,741 --> 02:22:48,062
We, I think we already lost class.

1341
02:22:48,903 --> 02:22:49,903
I think he thought we were done.

1342
02:22:49,923 --> 02:22:53,846
Andre and Steven, I'll make a motion to adjourn.

1343
02:22:54,586 --> 02:22:54,987
Thank you.

1344
02:22:55,007 --> 02:22:55,607
Is there a second?

1345
02:22:56,678 --> 02:22:57,959
I'll second, Deanna.

1346
02:22:57,999 --> 02:22:58,619
Thanks, Deanna.

1347
02:22:59,019 --> 02:23:00,180
Roll call vote.

1348
02:23:00,220 --> 02:23:00,880
David Blumberg.

1349
02:23:02,461 --> 02:23:02,621
Aye.

1350
02:23:03,802 --> 02:23:04,542
Jackie Furtado.

1351
02:23:05,122 --> 02:23:05,282
Aye.

1352
02:23:06,223 --> 02:23:06,903
Deanna Peabody.

1353
02:23:06,923 --> 02:23:07,904
Aye.

1354
02:23:08,584 --> 02:23:09,224
Christy Dowd.

1355
02:23:09,244 --> 02:23:10,165
Aye.

1356
02:23:11,205 --> 02:23:11,826
Aye as well.

1357
02:23:11,906 --> 02:23:12,866
Meeting is adjourned.

1358
02:23:13,046 --> 02:23:14,867
Thank you, everybody, for all your time.

1359
02:23:15,447 --> 02:23:15,888
Thank you.

1360
02:23:16,248 --> 02:23:16,788
Thanks, everyone.

1361
02:23:16,808 --> 02:23:17,488
Have a good night.

1362
02:23:19,649 --> 02:23:20,710
Victor, hope you feel better.
