We welcome and wish you all a healthy new year.

Sometimes we look over and have time for the agendas.

138
00:21:02,676 --> 00:21:03,437
We were hoping in 2018-2019

139
00:21:06,318 --> 00:21:12,223
that non-maintained buildings and big spending needlessly would stop.

140
00:21:13,004 --> 00:21:24,013
But looking at a quarter of a million dollars for an additional history room at the library just, you know, doesn't really, pardon the expression, cut it with a few of us.

141
00:21:24,853 --> 00:21:44,124
We have very many talented people in the city who will be able to contribute time artistic quality decorations to Some of the space that's going to be at this new library I think this is an item that you really have to think about Before you write out a check for a quarter of a million dollars.

142
00:21:44,164 --> 00:21:47,506
We think it's just a little bit unnecessary Thanks.

The city of Medford is an EEOAA 504 employer.

384
00:34:53,785 --> 00:34:59,508
Mr. President, we're going to wait for the remainder of the meeting to have a brief presentation about the petition.

385
00:35:12,908 --> 00:35:18,435
On the motion of Council tonight to waive the remainder of the reading, seconded by Councilor Behrs.

386
00:35:18,956 --> 00:35:19,837
All those in favor?

387
00:35:20,378 --> 00:35:21,139
All those opposed?

388
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:26,886
If we could please have the petitioner come forward tonight, give us a brief synopsis of

389
00:35:28,782 --> 00:35:31,383
the issue in your business, and tell us a little bit about what you're trying to do.

390
00:35:32,064 --> 00:35:32,204
Sure.

391
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:32,864
What you'd like to do.

392
00:35:33,605 --> 00:35:34,545
Hi, I'm Mike Denton.

393
00:35:35,426 --> 00:35:45,812
Redefine Strength and Fitness is going to be a small personal training and group fitness studio, and people like to do that early, so that's why we asked for the extension to 5 a.m.

394
00:35:48,073 --> 00:35:51,595
If there's anything further I can tell you, let me know, otherwise that's pretty much it.

395
00:35:52,005 --> 00:35:52,645
OK, thank you.

396
00:35:52,705 --> 00:35:55,246
So we have a set to go some procedural things first.

397
00:35:55,746 --> 00:36:03,069
So at this point, I declare the public hearing open and open in favor of those in favor of the petition.

398
00:36:03,089 --> 00:36:07,551
So if you could please have your name and address for the record.

399
00:36:09,412 --> 00:36:13,453
Mike Denton and 1 Bellevue Terrace, Unit 1A Medford.

400
00:36:14,313 --> 00:36:15,514
And you are in favor of the petition.

401
00:36:15,794 --> 00:36:16,574
I am in favor.

402
00:36:16,734 --> 00:36:16,914
Yes.

403
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:18,375
Name and address for the record.

404
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:26,383
Teresa Racicot, 1 Bellevue Terrace, Unit 1A Medford, and I'm in favor as well as a business partner.

405
00:36:27,583 --> 00:36:28,244
Thank you very much.

406
00:36:28,444 --> 00:36:31,705
Anyone else in favor of the petition at this time, I would ask to please step forward.

407
00:36:33,966 --> 00:36:34,806
Anyone else in favor?

408
00:36:35,507 --> 00:36:38,428
Hearing and seeing none, I declare this portion of the hearing closed.

409
00:36:40,249 --> 00:36:43,370
Anyone in opposition of the petition, please come forward.

410
00:36:45,451 --> 00:36:46,211
Anyone in opposition?

411
00:36:48,226 --> 00:36:51,388
Hearing and seeing none, I declare this portion of the hearing closed.

412
00:36:55,931 --> 00:36:57,392
I would ask you to please come forward at this point.

413
00:37:00,654 --> 00:37:01,494
Sorry, first time.

414
00:37:01,694 --> 00:37:02,815
No worries, no worries.

415
00:37:03,035 --> 00:37:03,956
Counselor Scott Pelley.

416
00:37:04,696 --> 00:37:06,017
If you could just give us the location.

417
00:37:07,518 --> 00:37:10,040
Where is the location?

418
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,581
215 B Salem Street.

419
00:37:11,681 --> 00:37:14,763
So it's, I'm,

420
00:37:15,587 --> 00:37:20,793
On the other side of 93, there's Brookline Bank, then used to be Stove King and the Vape Depot.

421
00:37:21,493 --> 00:37:23,476
The Vape Depot closed and we're moving in.

422
00:37:25,578 --> 00:37:32,105
And what type of exercises and fitness programs do you look like you'll be?

423
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:36,389
I would describe it broadly as strength training, fitness training.

424
00:37:37,217 --> 00:37:46,683
group exercise classes where you'll do some like cardio movements, like jumping jacks and then battle ropes and riding the bike.

425
00:37:47,544 --> 00:37:49,846
And that would be inside the facility, nothing outside?

426
00:37:50,206 --> 00:37:50,466
No.

427
00:37:50,706 --> 00:37:52,427
Yeah, all inside.

428
00:37:52,487 --> 00:37:53,688
There's no space outside.

429
00:37:53,848 --> 00:37:56,510
That's too bad, because I like space when I work out.

430
00:37:59,072 --> 00:37:59,512
Thank you.

431
00:37:59,892 --> 00:38:01,313
We'll have lots of natural light.

432
00:38:01,413 --> 00:38:01,954
I'll be there.

433
00:38:02,094 --> 00:38:03,035
Feel like outside.

434
00:38:05,136 --> 00:38:06,337
Thank you, Counselor Scott Pelley.

435
00:38:07,643 --> 00:38:08,363
Councilor Morrell.

436
00:38:09,344 --> 00:38:09,964
Thank you, Mr. President.

437
00:38:10,004 --> 00:38:14,265
I'm just curious if there might be loud music or any sound to be expected during this time.

438
00:38:14,905 --> 00:38:17,486
There will be music, but not loud music.

439
00:38:17,726 --> 00:38:19,967
Currently, the space is under construction.

440
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:23,688
The roof and the walls, all the exterior walls are being insulated.

441
00:38:24,448 --> 00:38:26,248
And I kind of don't like loud music.

442
00:38:27,049 --> 00:38:30,450
Yeah, we're not going to be wearing microphones to talk over the music.

443
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:31,570
So it'll be sort of like

444
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,061
We'll give instructions.

445
00:38:33,241 --> 00:38:34,281
The music will be down.

446
00:38:34,301 --> 00:38:38,783
We'll probably turn it up a little just to give a little bit of energy for people working out.

447
00:38:38,843 --> 00:38:40,124
But it won't be all the time.

448
00:38:40,364 --> 00:38:43,765
And as Mike said, it's all being re-insulated and redone.

449
00:38:43,866 --> 00:38:46,267
But it's also like thick concrete walls as well.

450
00:38:46,767 --> 00:38:46,847
OK.

451
00:38:47,327 --> 00:38:47,647
Thank you.

452
00:38:49,048 --> 00:38:49,968
Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

453
00:38:50,629 --> 00:38:51,149
Councilor Knight.

454
00:38:51,788 --> 00:38:53,028
Mr. President, thank you very much.

455
00:38:53,088 --> 00:38:56,949
It's always good to see the vape depot being replaced by a gym, right?

456
00:38:57,029 --> 00:39:00,750
I mean, I think it shows we're coming full circle down there on Salem Street when it comes to this issue.

457
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:03,510
I certainly don't have a problem with the petition.

458
00:39:04,171 --> 00:39:10,752
However, where it's a 5 o'clock in the morning application, it does raise some concerns to the quality of life of the residents in the neighborhood.

459
00:39:11,632 --> 00:39:16,373
So Mr. President, I certainly have no problem voting in favor of this this evening provided that

460
00:39:17,067 --> 00:39:21,050
We amend the application that the permit would go with the business and not the address.

461
00:39:21,671 --> 00:39:30,157
And that we put a 90 and a 180 day review on the special permit, Mr. President, to be sure that any issues in the neighborhood can be addressed in a timely fashion.

462
00:39:30,678 --> 00:39:38,504
As operations progress and business gets busier and you got half of the city of Medford in there beating down your door wanting to become members at your gym.

463
00:39:39,024 --> 00:39:42,126
We just want to make sure that the quality of life issues in the neighborhood are protected.

464
00:39:43,087 --> 00:39:50,691
This is common practice, we do this quite a bit where we put a 90 day review or a 180 day review on a special permit application for extended hours.

465
00:39:50,811 --> 00:40:00,477
And we also make sure that it goes with your business name as opposed to the address so that if you vacate and another entity comes in, that those extended hours aren't grandfathered in.

466
00:40:00,537 --> 00:40:03,138
So just a little explanation as to what the motions were that were made.

467
00:40:03,499 --> 00:40:05,800
I certainly wish you all the best of luck and don't have any opposition.

468
00:40:06,593 --> 00:40:09,214
To them putting in their personal fitness studio down there.

469
00:40:09,254 --> 00:40:10,094
Mr. President.

470
00:40:10,134 --> 00:40:14,375
However, we have to protect the interest of the neighborhood as well And I think that this is a good compromise.

471
00:40:14,935 --> 00:40:15,775
Thank you console night.

472
00:40:15,815 --> 00:40:29,697
I offer them in Thank You console night console skypelly I Yield I my fellow Counselor mentioned what I wanted to propose.

473
00:40:29,797 --> 00:40:30,057
Okay.

474
00:40:30,077 --> 00:40:30,297
Thank you.

475
00:40:30,557 --> 00:40:33,098
Thank you Any other questions from the council?

476
00:40:34,182 --> 00:40:49,510
Okay, on the motion of Councilor Scott Pelley, seconded by Councilor Knight, as amended by Councilor Knight, the amendment would be that the permit goes with the business and that there will be a review after 90 and 180 days.

477
00:40:51,171 --> 00:40:54,553
On that motion, Clerk Urtubis, please call the roll.

478
00:41:00,015 --> 00:41:00,516
Councilor Bears?

479
00:41:00,876 --> 00:41:01,076
Yes.

480
00:41:01,596 --> 00:41:02,337
Vice President Carriano?

481
00:41:02,617 --> 00:41:02,777
Yes.

482
00:41:09,269 --> 00:41:10,290
Yes.

483
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:11,631
70 affirmative, zero negative.

484
00:41:12,111 --> 00:41:12,912
The motion passes.

485
00:41:13,252 --> 00:41:14,593
Good luck and congratulations.

486
00:41:15,273 --> 00:41:15,673
Thank you.

487
00:41:16,374 --> 00:41:18,395
So should we come back in 90 days?

488
00:41:20,297 --> 00:41:26,561
Oh, okay.

489
00:41:27,702 --> 00:41:28,222
Thank you.

490
00:41:28,482 --> 00:41:28,743
Thank you.

491
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:47,754
Motions, orders, and resolutions 20-068 offered by Councilor Morrell be it resolved that the city administration provide an update on a storefront improvement program to support businesses in improving the curb appeal of our squares.

492
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:53,120
Councilor Morrell.

493
00:41:53,565 --> 00:41:54,466
Thank you, Mr President.

494
00:41:54,906 --> 00:42:05,553
So recently had a local business owner reach out and say that they had reached out to the city about a storefront improvement program, and they were told that we no longer run the program or we no longer issue funds.

495
00:42:05,973 --> 00:42:11,297
So these are local programs that provide financial support to businesses looking to improve or update their public facing.

496
00:42:11,777 --> 00:42:29,810
Facades I did reach out to Ashley Williams the CDBG administrator for the city to see if we could find out more She said in her time with the city three and a half years The program hasn't been run and it was kind of hard-pressed to find the last time this program has been run I actually did find reference to it in a job posting from 2019.

497
00:42:30,371 --> 00:42:38,396
So it seems there was previous interest in this but several our neighboring communities run these type of programs where they either offer a 0% deferred payment loan or a

498
00:42:39,517 --> 00:42:40,678
or matching grant funds.

499
00:42:40,938 --> 00:42:42,459
And a lot of times these funds are small.

500
00:42:43,299 --> 00:42:45,260
In many communities, they're capped around $2,000.

501
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:53,925
And I think with many of our local businesses operating on razor-thin margins, this program with small amounts of funds would actually make all the difference.

502
00:42:54,825 --> 00:42:57,066
So these programs are funded a number of different ways.

503
00:42:57,287 --> 00:43:05,431
So depending if it is a spot basis for a business where decay or blight can be identified, CDBG would possibly fund that.

504
00:43:05,901 --> 00:43:09,762
Same thing with businesses being in a certain census track, which we might not qualify for.

505
00:43:10,623 --> 00:43:19,166
But I think there's also the option where, with the business district parking funds that, as we were updated, I believe, have been found, for lack of a better word.

506
00:43:19,646 --> 00:43:30,350
Perhaps this is a way where we can directly fund businesses or support businesses to increase that curb appeal and beautification that we talk about so often in this city.

507
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:31,671
In this chamber.

508
00:43:32,352 --> 00:43:51,914
So really all I'm asking for is the city to provide an update on the sass of the program because that's Some hard to find and just to understand the level of interest so that as businesses do look for this program because this program does exist in Cambridge and blue burn and Worcester and still win in a number of surrounding communities as businesses come into Medford or they've been here for a long time and they're looking for this kind of support.

509
00:43:52,348 --> 00:43:54,830
We're able to give them an answer, point them in the right direction.

510
00:43:55,631 --> 00:44:04,337
And also to that end, there is the public meeting on March 11th for the CDBG five-year consolidated plan and one-year annual action plan where they are seeking public input.

511
00:44:04,397 --> 00:44:13,725
So I think having this update from the city from the status or interest in a program like this would be timely, understanding that public meeting is coming up on the 11th.

512
00:44:14,125 --> 00:44:15,446
So, thank you.

513
00:44:15,746 --> 00:44:16,667
Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

514
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:21,211
On the motion of Councilor Morrell, seconded by Councilor Knight.

515
00:44:21,552 --> 00:44:22,192
All those in favor?

516
00:44:22,212 --> 00:44:22,272
Aye.

517
00:44:22,912 --> 00:44:23,452
All those opposed?

518
00:44:23,472 --> 00:44:24,173
The motion passes.

519
00:44:26,854 --> 00:44:38,100
Petitions, presentations, and similar papers, 20-069, petition by Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street, Memphis, Massachusetts, 02155, to discuss zoning loopholes being exploited by flippers.

520
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,161
The clerk has notified me that

521
00:44:43,890 --> 00:45:10,057

523
00:45:21,476 --> 00:45:22,177

524
00:45:22,757 --> 00:45:23,378

525
00:45:23,398 --> 00:45:24,199
The motion passes.

526
00:45:24,259 --> 00:45:30,628
Offered by Councilor Marks, be it resolved that the safe routes project scheduled for High Street be discussed.

527
00:45:34,597 --> 00:45:35,258
Councilor Marks.

528
00:45:35,978 --> 00:45:36,979
Thank you, Mr. President.

529
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:41,203
The Memphis City Council had Committee of the Whole last week.

530
00:45:41,684 --> 00:45:42,925
We met with the Mass.

531
00:45:42,945 --> 00:45:58,239
Department of Transportation, as well as City Engineer, and they gave us an update on the Safe Routes to School project, which the Brooks School sought funding from the state back some

532
00:45:59,252 --> 00:46:14,143
two or three years I think now, and they just received $1 million for upgrades for safe routes along High Street, which includes Hastings Lane, Mystic Street, and Walcott Street.

533
00:46:14,943 --> 00:46:23,169
And some of the updates they're looking about curb extensions, bump outs, pedestrian lights in that particular area.

534
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:26,492
As part of this project, we were told by

535
00:46:27,238 --> 00:46:33,643
Mass Department of Transportation, that there will also be some land takings in that particular area.

536
00:46:34,463 --> 00:46:40,307
And the City of Meffitt is now reaching out to many of the homeowners along High Street.

537
00:46:41,008 --> 00:46:51,175
In addition, Mr. President, there is also going to be a bike lane that will be put on the southbound side of High Street.

538
00:46:52,424 --> 00:46:58,227
And the bike lane goes from Auburn Street all the way up to Woburn Street.

539
00:46:59,248 --> 00:47:03,850
And it starts and ends in that particular area.

540
00:47:05,711 --> 00:47:12,315
On the other side of the street, they will have a lane that could be used, I guess, for both bikes and cars mutually.

541
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:24,982
Just recently, Mr. President, the Traffic Commission also held a meeting because approval would be required by the Traffic Commission to eliminate some of the spots.

542
00:47:25,662 --> 00:47:40,226
We were told at last week's meeting, last Wednesday, that they numbered out the spots to be 60 on-street parking spots from Auburn Street all the way up to Hastings Lane.

543
00:47:41,067 --> 00:47:41,747
And of the 60,

544
00:47:43,467 --> 00:47:50,509
19, according to their numbers, were going to be eliminated on the southbound side.

545
00:47:51,170 --> 00:48:01,773
Now, over the last week, Mr. President, I, like many members behind this reel, have received a number of phone calls, residents that did attend the 2 p.m.

546
00:48:02,153 --> 00:48:05,054
Traffic Commission meeting and

547
00:48:06,624 --> 00:48:08,265
They weren't quite sure.

548
00:48:08,345 --> 00:48:14,310
They thought they were going there to listen to a presentation about this new Safe Routes project.

549
00:48:15,090 --> 00:48:29,121
And unbeknownst to them, there was an actual vote taken by the Traffic Commission to eliminate spots in front of people's homes that have been there for four, five, six decades, Mr. President.

550
00:48:29,501 --> 00:48:31,043
I don't think anyone behind this reel

551
00:48:31,763 --> 00:48:35,244
is against safe routes, and I think I could speak for my colleagues.

552
00:48:35,684 --> 00:48:36,864
I think we all welcome that.

553
00:48:37,204 --> 00:48:38,805
We all welcome state funding.

554
00:48:39,205 --> 00:48:42,246
Anytime you can get additional funding, that's great, Mr. President.

555
00:48:42,706 --> 00:48:50,488
But I do have concerns, Mr. President, that this project may not move forward if we're not able to reach a compromise.

556
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:55,662
And I think the best way to do it is at this point, where it's still in the early stages.

557
00:48:56,322 --> 00:49:11,429
And I'm formally requesting tonight that we ask our city engineer to go back to the Department of Transportation regarding the southbound bike lane that only is about two city, three city blocks.

558
00:49:12,129 --> 00:49:17,712
That they revisit the elimination, Mr. President, of those spots.

559
00:49:18,172 --> 00:49:22,913
to accommodate a five foot bike lane that leads to nowhere.

560
00:49:23,894 --> 00:49:26,254
It ends, it starts, it ends.

561
00:49:26,734 --> 00:49:28,455
And like I said, three city blocks.

562
00:49:29,275 --> 00:49:39,158
And we were told that the Department of Transportation will only entertain projects and only fund projects if it includes bike lanes.

563
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:46,659
But in my opinion, Mr. President, it makes no sense to have a bike lane that doesn't continue on.

564
00:49:47,479 --> 00:49:56,182
I asked a question that night, well, if it stops all the way up at Hastings Lane, where does the bike go after that?

565
00:49:56,642 --> 00:49:59,143
And they said the bike will continue to ride on the street.

566
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:10,451
Because under the laws of Massachusetts, bikes and cars are allowed to have equal access to the street.

567
00:50:12,192 --> 00:50:14,613
So I think we can head this off, Mr. President.

568
00:50:15,013 --> 00:50:26,875
I don't want to be at the last minute attending to neighborhood concerns when they're going to be asking for a vote of this council to improve land takings, which will make the project even go further down.

569
00:50:27,235 --> 00:50:34,897
So I would ask at this point that we intervene, we send a letter to our city engineer, let him know that we feel more comfortable.

570
00:50:36,118 --> 00:50:51,171
that the project, while it's in the early stages, be revisited to add those 19 spots that we're going to lose and come out with another solution that doesn't impact parking, Mr. President.

571
00:50:51,592 --> 00:50:57,097
Many of the residents were told, well, if you live on a high street and they're removing that spot, just park across the street.

572
00:50:57,988 --> 00:51:07,329
And one of the residents that called me said, well, my 80-year-old mother really shouldn't be crossing a very busy street that you're already saying this concerns.

573
00:51:08,248 --> 00:51:18,230
and having her walk another 300 yards to maybe get up to the pedestrian light to cross over to get to her house, where we've had this spot in front of my house for five decades.

574
00:51:19,371 --> 00:51:21,311
So I can see where they're coming from, Mr. President.

575
00:51:21,691 --> 00:51:36,635
Other residents on Mystic Street that contacted me were concerned that by eliminating these particular spots, especially next to the Brooks School, that you're just going to take people that are regularly parking on High Street and push them into the secondary roads.

576
00:51:37,375 --> 00:51:43,399
which I think is a concern for residents already in a busy area, Mr. President.

577
00:51:43,439 --> 00:52:00,370
So I would ask that in the form of a motion that we send it to the city engineer and have him contact DOT regarding the bike lane and other options available so we can continue to have the 60 spots that residents count on right now, Mr. President.

578
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:14,036
in a very cramped area, not just because of the school, because of the public transportation in the West Method area, because it's right out of the business district in West Method, and that area is very congested as is.

579
00:52:14,557 --> 00:52:15,437
Thank you, Mr. President.

580
00:52:15,497 --> 00:52:16,438
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

581
00:52:16,458 --> 00:52:19,999
There are a number of Councilors that want to speak on this.

582
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:24,962
So on the motion of Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

583
00:52:26,983 --> 00:52:27,443
Councilor Knight.

584
00:52:28,015 --> 00:52:31,916
Mr. President, thank you very much, and I couldn't put it any better than Councilor Marks.

585
00:52:32,436 --> 00:52:35,957
Ultimately, we have residents that live in homes that are upwards of $600,000 to $700,000.

586
00:52:35,997 --> 00:52:39,438
They pay property taxes in upwards of $7,000 to $8,000 a year, have vehicles, pay excise tax.

587
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:47,824
God forbid they want to have company over the house and you can't park in front of your own house.

588
00:52:48,084 --> 00:52:50,067
God forbid you have a landscaper or work being done.

589
00:52:50,127 --> 00:52:50,787
Where are they going to park?

590
00:52:50,888 --> 00:52:52,109
Where are they going to go, Mr. President?

591
00:52:53,150 --> 00:53:03,503
You know, I don't see the need for a path to nowhere, especially when we just spent how many millions of dollars extending a community path one block

592
00:53:05,051 --> 00:53:18,280
away at Memorial Park with crosswalk right at Auburn Street, crosswalk right at Winthrop Street that runs actually all the way from Medford Square all the way to the Brooks School, Mr. President.

593
00:53:18,301 --> 00:53:22,023
So we actually have a bike path, a community path that's in place now that's been constructed.

594
00:53:22,323 --> 00:53:24,885
We all took pictures next to the sign when they did the ribbon cutting.

595
00:53:25,205 --> 00:53:25,666
And it's there.

596
00:53:26,126 --> 00:53:26,446
It's there.

597
00:53:26,466 --> 00:53:27,827
And it's underutilized, Mr. President.

598
00:53:28,208 --> 00:53:29,709
But I think that that's a good compromise.

599
00:53:29,749 --> 00:53:32,851
I mean, ultimately, we have a community path that's one block away.

600
00:53:33,351 --> 00:53:39,734
We have residents in this community that have invested their life savings to purchase these homes, and their quality of life is going to be impacted by it.

601
00:53:40,515 --> 00:53:47,338
You know, we talk about zoning and ordinances and taking away inner court parking, Mr. President, inner court parking.

602
00:53:47,378 --> 00:53:55,922
You know, you're not allowed to park inside the front, the inner court of your house, but they'll come down and they'll put a bike lane right in front of your house, and then you won't have any place to put your car.

603
00:53:56,302 --> 00:53:57,022
So where's it going to go?

604
00:53:57,062 --> 00:53:58,023
It's going to go to Mystic Avenue.

605
00:53:58,143 --> 00:53:59,023
It's going to go to Mystic Street.

606
00:53:59,363 --> 00:54:00,344
It's going to go to Auburn Street.

607
00:54:00,724 --> 00:54:01,865
It's going to go to Piedmont Street.

608
00:54:01,945 --> 00:54:02,445
It's going to go to...

609
00:54:03,246 --> 00:54:08,473
All the ancillary secondary roads that people can't find a place to park their car, they're going to put them in the neighborhoods.

610
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:15,102
Now, just last Wednesday, I had the opportunity to go to the Brooks School for a wonderful winter concert, Mr. President.

611
00:54:15,343 --> 00:54:18,087
And I think I'm confident in saying that my kids are never going to win a Grammy.

612
00:54:19,108 --> 00:54:27,778
But when I got there, I had to park my car, and it was, there's 100 kids in the Brooks School's kindergarten class this year, and it was the kindergarten concert.

613
00:54:28,058 --> 00:54:30,140
So there were a number of families that were there, 100 families.

614
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:33,584
So you can imagine what the parking was like at the Brooks School during a regular school day, Mr. President.

615
00:54:34,005 --> 00:54:37,769
I had to park almost in front of Councilor Caviello's house on Prescott Street.

616
00:54:39,268 --> 00:54:40,309
to go to the concert.

617
00:54:40,469 --> 00:54:42,250
And that's with the parking on High Street.

618
00:54:42,911 --> 00:54:48,955
So as events happen in our schools, as our school population grows, those spots are going to become more and more valuable.

619
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:51,337
So I can't agree more with Councilor Marks.

620
00:54:51,357 --> 00:54:59,563
You know, I think we need to take a look at this and figure out a solution that's a compromise that allows the residents to maintain their quality of life while also implementing the Safe Routes to School project.

621
00:55:00,544 --> 00:55:04,067
You know, a path that starts here and ends there and doesn't go anywhere.

622
00:55:04,107 --> 00:55:05,768
I don't see the benefit, Mr. President.

623
00:55:05,808 --> 00:55:06,248
I really don't.

624
00:55:07,409 --> 00:55:08,170
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

625
00:55:10,572 --> 00:55:11,393
Councilor Scarpelli.

626
00:55:12,253 --> 00:55:12,974
Thank you, Mr. President.

627
00:55:12,994 --> 00:55:18,737
I thank Councilor Marks for bringing this forward and Councilor Knight for adding his input.

628
00:55:18,757 --> 00:55:25,321
I think that, not to be redundant, but there are some great safety initiatives in place with the safe routes.

629
00:55:25,882 --> 00:55:27,903
You know, I love the Woburn Street Island.

630
00:55:27,943 --> 00:55:31,986
I think that's something that's really needed, a crosswalk in that area.

631
00:55:32,406 --> 00:55:34,427
And you'd hate to throw away

632
00:55:36,008 --> 00:55:39,789
you know, a great plan for a few sticking points.

633
00:55:39,849 --> 00:55:55,974
But I will tell you, the phone calls I did receive as well and emails are the same issues and concerns where you're talking about safety being the number one concern and you are, I had a phone call from an 80-year-old resident that had that same concern.

634
00:55:56,934 --> 00:55:59,055
response saying that it's safe routes.

635
00:55:59,716 --> 00:56:07,100
Now I have to park across the street if I want to park, and I have to cross one of the major throughways.

636
00:56:07,221 --> 00:56:10,383
Like I said, I won't be redundant, but I support this 100%.

637
00:56:11,383 --> 00:56:21,269
I think to revisit this is very important, and I think we need to really take a hard stop and to revisit this, so thank you.

638
00:56:21,529 --> 00:56:22,730
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

639
00:56:24,651 --> 00:56:25,252
Councilor Beers.

640
00:56:25,885 --> 00:56:26,726
Thank you, Mr. President.

641
00:56:28,347 --> 00:56:33,031
First, I want to acknowledge definitely that we need to make sure that we have the best community process possible.

642
00:56:33,091 --> 00:56:46,342
And I want to acknowledge the city engineer and the traffic engineer's outreach to many houses and families in the area, both the folks who are having takings, the folks who have issues with walls, as we heard extensively last meeting.

643
00:56:47,548 --> 00:56:57,574
And I think, absolutely, we need to make every possible action we can to accommodate people with disabilities, people with handicap parking, 80-year-olds who really need access to their home.

644
00:56:58,215 --> 00:56:59,275
But there's a few things here.

645
00:56:59,315 --> 00:57:03,198
I think the first thing to say is that this is 100% state and federal money.

646
00:57:03,558 --> 00:57:06,219
This project doesn't use any city dollars.

647
00:57:06,239 --> 00:57:07,400
So I just want to put that out there.

648
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:08,521
And it's not matching.

649
00:57:08,581 --> 00:57:09,301
It's not additional.

650
00:57:09,341 --> 00:57:11,222
This is a million dollars we won't otherwise have.

651
00:57:11,963 --> 00:57:14,705
And no city money will be going towards it.

652
00:57:16,603 --> 00:57:30,115
So a few things, one, the studies done by the traffic engineer and the city engineer showed that much of the parking on the south side of High Street does go underused most of the time.

653
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:32,277
That's not to say there aren't cases and specifics.

654
00:57:33,472 --> 00:57:43,896
kindergarten concerts and certain people who park in front of their houses of a certain age, but that the statistics showed that most of that parking was going underutilized or unutilized completely.

655
00:57:44,516 --> 00:57:48,258
And then just this bike path to nowhere thing.

656
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:53,860
You might not think I ride a bike, and I've never ridden a bike on High Street, but I have a lot of friends who do bike, and

657
00:57:54,923 --> 00:57:56,745
That's actually the one place on High Street.

658
00:57:56,765 --> 00:58:04,532
If I had to pick anywhere on High Street between the Arlington Rotary and the Winthrop Street Rotary to put a bike lane, it would be exactly where this bike lane is.

659
00:58:04,692 --> 00:58:10,538
It's the highest slope uphill in a place where traffic coming across the hill is obstructed view.

660
00:58:10,598 --> 00:58:12,219
You can't see people coming up the hill.

661
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:18,085
And you need to separate out bike traffic and street traffic or else you're going to get in a situation where you have bike traffic.

662
00:58:18,565 --> 00:58:21,626
slowing up to 10, five miles an hour.

663
00:58:21,686 --> 00:58:28,829
You try huffing a bike all the way up the hill from West Medford Square to the top of the hill past Auburn Street, you're gonna be biking pretty slow.

664
00:58:28,969 --> 00:58:35,891
And the point of this bike lane is to separate out the traffic at exactly the point at which the speed of the bikes and the speeds of the car traffic are gonna be at the most disparate.

665
00:58:36,411 --> 00:58:38,233
So it's not really a path to nowhere.

666
00:58:38,273 --> 00:58:45,741
It's saying that if you're on share road shared lanes everywhere else, this is the one spot of the road where you actually want to separate out the traffic.

667
00:58:45,761 --> 00:58:47,002
So that's just the bike.

668
00:58:47,743 --> 00:58:48,944
That's the engineering behind it.

669
00:58:50,545 --> 00:58:52,768
And so I just want to put out there, it's not really a path to nowhere.

670
00:58:52,788 --> 00:58:55,490
It's actually putting a bike lane in one of the spots where it's safest.

671
00:58:55,510 --> 00:58:56,812
Point of information, Councillor Marks.

672
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:02,291
Thank you, Mr. President.

673
00:59:02,691 --> 00:59:12,815
You know, the report that was done spoke about the number of spots and how their utilization rate is pretty low in that area.

674
00:59:13,335 --> 00:59:26,041
Anyone that would drive, I don't know when they did this report, I don't know who did the study, but anyone that's familiar with that area would know the southbound, maybe not all the way up to Auburn Street, but further down, is always packed with cars.

675
00:59:26,581 --> 00:59:27,762
So that's number one.

676
00:59:28,142 --> 00:59:36,486
Secondly, Mr. President, has there been any report or indication how many bikes are actually using this particular area?

677
00:59:37,027 --> 00:59:38,447
I haven't heard anything about that.

678
00:59:38,888 --> 00:59:48,013
And to me, to have a bike lane that ends at the top of Auburn and then going down a windy rest of a high street is

679
00:59:48,873 --> 00:59:56,399
far more of a public safety concern when that lane ends, Mr. President, than having a fake lane for three city blocks.

680
00:59:56,779 --> 01:00:01,303
And I think the area that would be a concern is not in that particular area.

681
01:00:01,483 --> 01:00:10,890
It would be what happens after that, Mr. President, because the bike lane ends, as Councilor Scott Pelly mentioned, right where the new intersection will be with Woburn.

682
01:00:11,861 --> 01:00:14,962
So they're creating a new island there that's going to be like a fork in the road.

683
01:00:15,343 --> 01:00:20,825
That's where my problem is with this particular bike lane, Mr. President.

684
01:00:20,845 --> 01:00:27,068
I think you're setting up bike riders for failure in this particular area with a false sense of security.

685
01:00:27,268 --> 01:00:28,629
That's all I wanted to add, Mr. President.

686
01:00:28,649 --> 01:00:31,150
Point of information, Mr. President.

687
01:00:31,190 --> 01:00:33,271
I think if you ask bike riders, they might disagree with you.

688
01:00:34,931 --> 01:00:35,732
I completely agree.

689
01:00:35,792 --> 01:00:41,975
I think we should, the windy section between Winthrop Street and Woburn Street, that'd be great, but that's not in the scope of this project.

690
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:44,456
So I don't think we should throw the baby out with the bathwater here.

691
01:00:45,297 --> 01:00:46,637
This is going to make the street safer.

692
01:00:47,238 --> 01:00:48,198
It's a dangerous street.

693
01:00:48,939 --> 01:00:54,401
And if we're saying that this is the end all be all and we kill it over this and something happens, God forbid, I think that's on us.

694
01:00:54,481 --> 01:00:55,522
So I'm just saying here,

695
01:00:56,647 --> 01:00:58,808
We shouldn't, I agree, we should talk to folks.

696
01:00:58,888 --> 01:01:10,753
I'm fine moving the process forward, but if it comes down to the federal and state government saying we will not provide you with this money if you want this change, I think we really need to think hard about that because we're talking about the safety of a major thoroughfare.

697
01:01:12,294 --> 01:01:14,034
Point of information, Councilor Knight.

698
01:01:15,295 --> 01:01:24,539
I think the funding sources are relevant at some point when, you know, well the feds are going to give us a million bucks, so let's impact the quality of life of these residents because it's not tax dollars.

699
01:01:26,283 --> 01:01:28,584
You know, I mean, the million bucks is the million bucks.

700
01:01:28,605 --> 01:01:29,205
They're going to leave it.

701
01:01:29,245 --> 01:01:31,426
Tomorrow, we're going to be just as good as we were yesterday without it.

702
01:01:31,706 --> 01:01:33,107
You know, things aren't going to change.

703
01:01:33,127 --> 01:01:35,709
The only way things are going to change is if we take it, Mr. President.

704
01:01:35,769 --> 01:01:37,490
The only way things are going to change is if we take the money.

705
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:38,551
So let's sit down.

706
01:01:38,871 --> 01:01:40,572
Excuse me, I have the microphone.

707
01:01:40,852 --> 01:01:44,034
So, Mr. President, ultimately, you know what I mean, I agree with Councilor Max.

708
01:01:44,054 --> 01:01:47,557
We need to have a discussion about this, and we need to figure out what we can do to protect people's quality of life.

709
01:01:47,617 --> 01:01:52,680
Maybe that's allowing in-accord parking in areas where bike lanes take away parking in front of their home.

710
01:01:54,015 --> 01:01:57,818
That's an option, that's a solution, but it's something we need to talk about before we start going.

711
01:01:57,898 --> 01:02:06,184
We've already put a bike lane down Winthrop Street, and we have a resident on Winthrop Street that every 90 days is putting an application in before the traffic commission asking them to take it out so we can park in front of his house.

712
01:02:07,285 --> 01:02:09,466
So that's the reality of the situation.

713
01:02:09,507 --> 01:02:10,147
It sounds great.

714
01:02:10,167 --> 01:02:11,388
Yeah, we're making everybody safer.

715
01:02:11,408 --> 01:02:12,909
These bike lanes are making everybody safer.

716
01:02:12,949 --> 01:02:14,410
No one's ever going to get in a bike accident again.

717
01:02:14,670 --> 01:02:15,151
Not the case.

718
01:02:15,731 --> 01:02:16,592
Not the case.

719
01:02:18,117 --> 01:02:20,478
Thank you, Consular Knight, with your point of information.

720
01:02:20,539 --> 01:02:22,099
Consular Beers, you can continue.

721
01:02:22,220 --> 01:02:31,385
Yeah, I mean, again, I just think we will be worse off if something happens, and right now we are worse off because people drive 45 miles an hour down High Street, and it's incredibly dangerous.

722
01:02:31,465 --> 01:02:33,346
So I just want to make that clear.

723
01:02:34,507 --> 01:02:35,167
That's the question.

724
01:02:35,188 --> 01:02:36,188
It's a very wide street.

725
01:02:36,949 --> 01:02:39,870
This project would make it much safer, safer to cross at all hours.

726
01:02:41,251 --> 01:02:47,315
Sure, let's reassess the parking, but I think the idea of a bike lane to nowhere and the rhetoric we're hearing here is a little overblown, and we really

727
01:02:47,738 --> 01:02:59,742
If the point of this study is to make sure that we have all our ducks in a row and we know everything, let's go with what the studies have said and what the traffic engineer and the city engineer have been saying, you know, if we really want to get there.

728
01:02:59,962 --> 01:03:05,684
And I don't find that the bike lane-to-nowhere thing is grounded in any sort of evidence.

729
01:03:05,984 --> 01:03:09,966
Yes, we have another unsafe situation half a mile down the street.

730
01:03:10,006 --> 01:03:11,206
We should address this as well.

731
01:03:11,346 --> 01:03:16,548
But if you're a biker biking up High Street towards the eastbound east,

732
01:03:17,546 --> 01:03:23,591
I'm pretty sure most bikers would say they'd rather have a separated lane so they're not worried someone's going to come up at 35 miles an hour and hit them from behind.

733
01:03:25,033 --> 01:03:25,713
Thank you, Mr. President.

734
01:03:25,733 --> 01:03:26,774
Thank you, Councilor Pierce.

735
01:03:29,416 --> 01:03:31,738
Point of information, Councilor Marks.

736
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:37,303
I just want to clarify, it's not a separated lane.

737
01:03:37,563 --> 01:03:39,165
That's a big clarification.

738
01:03:40,626 --> 01:03:42,828
It's its own lane, but it's not a separated lane.

739
01:03:43,188 --> 01:03:44,830
It's not separated by anything.

740
01:03:45,907 --> 01:03:47,468
It's its own lane, but there's a distinction.

741
01:03:48,689 --> 01:03:49,709
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

742
01:03:52,411 --> 01:03:54,012
Point of information, Councilor Beers.

743
01:03:54,592 --> 01:03:55,733
A separately marked lane.

744
01:03:56,693 --> 01:03:57,594
Separately marked lane, okay.

745
01:03:57,614 --> 01:03:57,834
Yes.

746
01:03:58,454 --> 01:03:59,455
Thank you, Councilor Beers.

747
01:04:02,616 --> 01:04:03,437
Councilor Caviello.

748
01:04:03,717 --> 01:04:04,498
Thank you, Mr. President.

749
01:04:04,518 --> 01:04:12,642
Well, that happens to be the neighborhood where I live, and while everybody else was getting the phone calls, I was getting the people in my house.

750
01:04:14,419 --> 01:04:20,644
One of the biggest complaints I heard was a lot of people were never even notified of this, even people on High Street.

751
01:04:20,664 --> 01:04:27,569
So I know they said that they notified people, but I think maybe they just notified the people that they were taking land from.

752
01:04:28,370 --> 01:04:35,015
But I heard people from Mystic Street and Austin Street, and they said there was no notification of this.

753
01:04:35,735 --> 01:04:39,178
And the few that did get the notification couldn't go to the meeting at 2 o'clock.

754
01:04:40,302 --> 01:04:47,207
So that's also part of the issue here, too, aside from taking the parking space away.

755
01:04:47,247 --> 01:05:04,699
So this next meeting, I think there should be a little bit more notification of the neighbors, not just on High Street, but maybe some of the houses on Mystic and Hastings, where all these cars are going to end up going at some point.

756
01:05:05,079 --> 01:05:06,140
So like I say,

757
01:05:07,774 --> 01:05:13,818
Please make sure that there is proper notification for this next meeting, and not at 2 o'clock in the afternoon either.

758
01:05:14,519 --> 01:05:20,684
Yes, if I may, that meeting was scheduled by the Traffic Commission.

759
01:05:21,284 --> 01:05:31,272
We've all had issues with when they schedule meetings because they're always at 2 p.m., which to me is just, it just gives such a disservice because most of the population can't make it at 2 p.m.

760
01:05:31,872 --> 01:05:34,034
So I'm in complete agreement with you on that.

761
01:05:34,475 --> 01:05:34,755
Thank you.

762
01:05:35,517 --> 01:05:35,837
Thank you.

763
01:05:35,857 --> 01:05:39,059
Got some caviar.

764
01:05:40,039 --> 01:05:40,820
Thank you, Mr President.

765
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:44,241
I support exploring this a little bit further.

766
01:05:44,261 --> 01:05:49,404
I was remiss during that meeting and understanding the handicapped spaces.

767
01:05:49,424 --> 01:05:56,467
I'm sure there are no handicapped spaces that would be removed as part of this that are proposed to be removed, but just understanding that those spaces.

768
01:05:56,898 --> 01:05:59,421
and the accessible spaces do remain for the people that need them.

769
01:06:00,282 --> 01:06:05,289
To the point of this debate over the bike lane to nowhere, I think people are missing the point that this is a safe route to school.

770
01:06:05,869 --> 01:06:07,531
So that lane is right around the school.

771
01:06:07,571 --> 01:06:12,538
The idea is that children will be in that safe, protected bike lane and get to the school safely.

772
01:06:13,038 --> 01:06:31,163
Adults can then merge into traffic bike riders can then merge into traffic as they are used to in many points through many cities I understand the residents who are concerned about having to cross the street if they have to park across the street The point of this project is to make that street safer so that people can cross so that people as they drive through that corridor

773
01:06:31,697 --> 01:06:36,381
they see bikes, they see pedestrians, they see cars, they understand this isn't an area that I just fly through.

774
01:06:36,861 --> 01:06:46,268
This is an area that has the flashing crossing right now, that has a crossing guard, and you can go to that area in the mornings and watch the crossing guard almost get hit by cars.

775
01:06:47,209 --> 01:06:56,016
So I think we are running the risk of losing this money by not being able to see the forest through the trees.

776
01:06:57,061 --> 01:07:13,668
And people talk about not having money to do things in Medford and we have a million dollars to make these streets safer, to make the streets safer in front of our school, to support children getting to school, to support alternative transportation to school, to remove some of the cars from the area because people are walking, because people are biking.

777
01:07:14,088 --> 01:07:16,329
And we're looking for ways to lose this money.

778
01:07:17,010 --> 01:07:22,072
So I do support exploring it further, seeing if there are options where we can come to a compromise.

779
01:07:22,572 --> 01:07:24,873
But I think we are not seeing the bigger picture here.

780
01:07:26,555 --> 01:07:26,855
Thank you.

781
01:07:27,155 --> 01:07:28,095
Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

782
01:07:29,176 --> 01:07:29,796
Councilor Beers.

783
01:07:30,336 --> 01:07:31,837
Yeah, and just another point of information.

784
01:07:31,877 --> 01:07:45,381
I believe that the folks from MassDOT and the city engineer said that they permit for Safe Routes to School over a five-year period, 15 to 20 projects are approved during that time, and there were at least double the applications of that.

785
01:07:45,401 --> 01:07:47,702
It was an incredibly selective process.

786
01:07:47,722 --> 01:07:54,164
We were one of, I believe, three projects in the whole state to be permitted, at least that's my recollection from the meeting in that year.

787
01:07:56,082 --> 01:07:59,905
A lot of people did a lot of work to get to this point, including a lot of parents who send their kids to the Brooks School.

788
01:08:01,206 --> 01:08:02,067
Thank you, Councilor Beers.

789
01:08:02,087 --> 01:08:03,648
Mr. President.

790
01:08:04,249 --> 01:08:06,150
Councilor Caviello is up next.

791
01:08:06,370 --> 01:08:07,091
Councilor Caviello.

792
01:08:10,433 --> 01:08:10,873
It's lit here.

793
01:08:10,913 --> 01:08:15,775
I don't think anybody is looking to stop the project or just back away from it.

794
01:08:15,795 --> 01:08:19,276
I think we're looking to revisit it and see if we can make some modifications.

795
01:08:19,776 --> 01:08:29,180
I think that's all that we're, I think that's all my councilors are asking for is let's see what we can do to make a happy medium to keep the residents happy and the kids going to school happy.

796
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:31,841
So, I don't, I say, I don't think we're looking to stop it.

797
01:08:31,861 --> 01:08:33,301
Point of information, Councilor Morrell.

798
01:08:36,390 --> 01:08:42,016
I did clarify with the city engineer that this funding is based on the multimodal.

799
01:08:42,076 --> 01:08:43,558
So it's walking and biking.

800
01:08:43,658 --> 01:08:46,741
So the compromise has to include biking in some way.

801
01:08:47,622 --> 01:08:48,523
Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

802
01:08:49,404 --> 01:08:51,406
Councilor Caviello.

803
01:08:51,526 --> 01:08:51,887
Thank you.

804
01:08:52,307 --> 01:08:52,928
Councilor Marks.

805
01:08:54,750 --> 01:08:55,631
Thank you, Mr. President.

806
01:08:55,671 --> 01:08:59,713
And that was when I made my opening statement to see if we can come up with an alternative.

807
01:09:00,333 --> 01:09:04,455
And it's our job as elected officials to also represent the neighborhood.

808
01:09:04,995 --> 01:09:06,256
And I think that's what we're doing.

809
01:09:06,276 --> 01:09:16,922
And the reason why I brought it up now, Mr. President, so we wouldn't be bringing the issue up at the last hour when everything is all set in stone, all the land takings are signed off, and then they need a vote of the council.

810
01:09:17,622 --> 01:09:26,744
This gives them ample time to revisit the process, Mr. President, and find out what we can do to accommodate the residents that have a hardship, Mr. President.

811
01:09:27,224 --> 01:09:28,464
That's all we're asking here tonight.

812
01:09:28,684 --> 01:09:30,924
We're not asking to stop the project.

813
01:09:31,184 --> 01:09:32,945
We're not asking to give money back.

814
01:09:33,445 --> 01:09:34,565
You know, that's a red herring.

815
01:09:34,585 --> 01:09:36,525
No one's asking for that, Mr. President.

816
01:09:36,745 --> 01:09:46,147
We're asking to safeguard residents that contact us and have every right to do so because it's a quality of life issue that's impacting them, Mr. President.

817
01:09:46,674 --> 01:09:50,917
You know, so any project worth its weight, Mr. President, needs to be properly vetted.

818
01:09:51,238 --> 01:09:57,422
The fact that the state may come in and say, well, the federal government, this is how it's going to work, that's fine for them, Mr. President.

819
01:09:57,683 --> 01:10:02,846
Then it's up to us as a community to stand up and say, this works for us, and then comes for a compromise.

820
01:10:03,307 --> 01:10:04,248
That's all I'm saying.

821
01:10:04,888 --> 01:10:05,849
Thank you, Councillor Marks.

822
01:10:05,909 --> 01:10:06,750
Councillor Scarpelli.

823
01:10:07,931 --> 01:10:17,020
Again, I think that was my initial input with this is that it's not something that we want to eliminate.

824
01:10:17,856 --> 01:10:19,077
but it's looking for alternatives.

825
01:10:19,157 --> 01:10:31,327
And I think that there could be something as simple as notifying those residents that might be elderly that do qualify for handicap placards that never had an issue with that in the past that can now apply for that.

826
01:10:31,607 --> 01:10:38,593
Or maybe it could be something that you look at different times where parking overnight might be an issue.

827
01:10:39,013 --> 01:10:40,555
That might be the biggest issue with them.

828
01:10:40,855 --> 01:10:45,138
And maybe making it so when it's the most dangerous times that

829
01:10:46,037 --> 01:10:49,238
they can look at different parking restrictions.

830
01:10:49,278 --> 01:10:52,199
So there's so many different variations to look at this.

831
01:10:52,239 --> 01:11:04,842
And again, I don't want anybody to be confused with my input with eliminating something, or saying we don't want this money, or we don't want to keep our bicyclists safe, or we don't want our students at the Brooks.

832
01:11:04,862 --> 01:11:11,024
Because to be honest with you, I got a lot of phone calls from parents from the Brooks that had some concerns.

833
01:11:11,484 --> 01:11:14,665
And one of the concerns with what Councilor Knight said is that when

834
01:11:15,405 --> 01:11:21,925
they do have a concern with, or an issue with the school, or they have something, there is overflow parking.

835
01:11:23,507 --> 01:11:44,658
Putting them further away from the school further away from that parking area That's what they're concerned about their safety is having their child and parents or grandparents walk now that extra area so I understand you know we have some You know allegiance to our bike riders, but that's not that it's not this isn't a

836
01:11:45,738 --> 01:11:46,539
for or against them.

837
01:11:46,599 --> 01:12:00,817
This is something that just to look forward to a dialogue that making sure that like Councilor Carvello said is getting those neighbors because we're now a community of transparency and making sure that everybody knows what's going on.

838
01:12:00,837 --> 01:12:02,119
I think that's one of the things that

839
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:13,451
The feedback I did get back was that the communication was really about taking of the land, but really not defined of taking of parking spots or having the input of those residents.

840
01:12:13,951 --> 01:12:19,337
And I think that is a huge piece that has to be sent in that motion.

841
01:12:19,377 --> 01:12:20,678
So thank you, Mr. President.

842
01:12:20,859 --> 01:12:22,000
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

843
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:22,941
Councilor Beers.

844
01:12:23,101 --> 01:12:23,982
Thank you, Mr. President.

845
01:12:25,657 --> 01:12:34,045
I think I started my remarks saying I agree that we need to make sure that community input is what it needs to be and that everyone has a chance to get notified and have their voice on it.

846
01:12:34,125 --> 01:12:46,057
I just also want to make sure that we don't, in the process of doing that, use rhetoric that may not be entirely accurate about bike lanes, that may injure or bias

847
01:12:46,950 --> 01:12:50,874
The people viewing to think that one part of this project is less important than the other.

848
01:12:50,914 --> 01:12:52,496
I think we're balancing needs, right?

849
01:12:52,516 --> 01:12:55,639
We're talking about balancing the need for on-street parking and the need for bike safety.

850
01:12:55,679 --> 01:12:58,943
And then this third need, which is what are the requirements of the project?

851
01:12:59,464 --> 01:13:01,165
Or what are the requirements of the funding?

852
01:13:01,546 --> 01:13:06,992
And I just think we need to be careful with the words that we use.

853
01:13:07,032 --> 01:13:08,914
I mean, to say that this bike lane goes to nowhere.

854
01:13:10,390 --> 01:13:12,513
It's not exactly accurate to its purpose.

855
01:13:12,533 --> 01:13:14,495
So that's that's the reason that I brought it forward again.

856
01:13:14,535 --> 01:13:15,516
I'm not biking up the street.

857
01:13:15,556 --> 01:13:16,116
I'm driving.

858
01:13:16,237 --> 01:13:20,281
So, you know, I have it's not coming from my personal experience.

859
01:13:20,942 --> 01:13:24,045
But, you know, that's where I'm coming from on this.

860
01:13:24,285 --> 01:13:28,530
And I also think we just need to make sure that we don't let people think.

861
01:13:29,931 --> 01:13:34,672
You know if we want this project to go forward we need to make sure that we're being completely open that I think as admitted here.

862
01:13:34,952 --> 01:13:40,033
We need to look at the options and maybe keeping on street parking in some cases won't be an option if we want to move forward.

863
01:13:40,073 --> 01:13:45,515
And I don't think we want through the idea of saying we want to compromise and come together on this which I don't think is a bad thing.

864
01:13:45,855 --> 01:13:51,956
I just don't want to think that we can also say that everyone's going to get everything they want at the end of the day because that's not really what we're in the business here.

865
01:13:52,704 --> 01:13:56,966
It's it's we can't keep all the parking and do the bike lane and so maybe there's a solution here.

866
01:13:57,106 --> 01:13:57,707
Maybe there's not.

867
01:13:57,727 --> 01:13:59,127
And I think we need to be open about that.

868
01:13:59,147 --> 01:14:04,110
And I also think we need to be open about the timeline that we're on which is you know we have some time here.

869
01:14:04,150 --> 01:14:06,311
I think this is a better time to bring it up in three months from now.

870
01:14:06,351 --> 01:14:07,852
And I completely agree with that.

871
01:14:07,992 --> 01:14:13,815
But you know we do have a timeline to keep for land takings and all of this to go forward.

872
01:14:13,895 --> 01:14:18,757
So I just want to make sure that while we're respecting that and respecting what our reality of our options are here that we don't

873
01:14:19,152 --> 01:14:22,275
let people think that they're going to get something that they're not going to get out of it as well.

874
01:14:22,495 --> 01:14:28,321
I think we need to be realistic about what this final, what the end game here, what the solution might be.

875
01:14:28,682 --> 01:14:31,244
And that's where I'm coming from on it.

876
01:14:31,464 --> 01:14:34,007
And I think that's our job.

877
01:14:35,368 --> 01:14:36,329
Thank you, Councilor Piers.

878
01:14:36,369 --> 01:14:36,870
Councilor Knight.

879
01:14:37,358 --> 01:14:39,859
I think we've beaten the horse to death, Mr. President, on this one.

880
01:14:40,859 --> 01:14:41,439
I would agree.

881
01:14:43,979 --> 01:14:45,760
Everyone has brought in some very valid points.

882
01:14:46,580 --> 01:14:51,381
And we do have a resident that would like to speak on this, or maybe a few residents.

883
01:14:51,401 --> 01:14:53,381
So if we could please have your name and address for the record.

884
01:14:53,721 --> 01:14:54,041
Sure.

885
01:14:54,161 --> 01:14:55,942
Jean Nuzzo, 35 Parrish Street.

886
01:14:58,322 --> 01:15:07,004
Definitely, if you've ever spent any time in West Medford on High Street in that area, while there's not a significant high number

887
01:15:07,626 --> 01:15:08,887
of bicyclists.

888
01:15:09,067 --> 01:15:16,495
There are many, and they travel that road faithfully, and it is a dangerous area for them to be.

889
01:15:17,376 --> 01:15:23,742
One of the things that we do in the industry that you may want to consider is a mock-up... The cycling industry?

890
01:15:24,562 --> 01:15:26,584
No, in the construction industry.

891
01:15:26,684 --> 01:15:29,526
I do not cycle.

892
01:15:29,666 --> 01:15:31,128
Although, you know, in my younger days.

893
01:15:32,168 --> 01:15:38,413
One of the things we do do is we mock up and we mark out space, especially in these incremental changes.

894
01:15:38,874 --> 01:15:53,525
There are organizations like Team Better Block, I think they're called, that will come in and chalk mark the area in advance so that the residents and the community can see what the impact is that you're going to affect.

895
01:15:53,986 --> 01:15:54,707
for a change.

896
01:15:55,267 --> 01:16:07,537
It's not a lot of money, it's not a lasting change, but it allows people to see that change and then start to provide meaningful feedback because most people cannot look at a drawing

897
01:16:08,038 --> 01:16:10,740
and truly conceptualize what the impact of that is.

898
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:21,288
And I think we saw that down in South Medford across from the Tufts Pool, where we invested significant money to make a change to the flow of traffic.

899
01:16:21,969 --> 01:16:26,132
And it's been disastrous for the neighborhood because it put all the traffic down the side street.

900
01:16:26,912 --> 01:16:34,218
And while the Brooks School has a hawk signal that flashes, the Columbus School does not.

901
01:16:34,738 --> 01:16:51,281
and they get a significant amount of traffic and cars flow very fastly there as do the Roberts and the McGlynn so I think holistically we have a problem with people traveling excessively fast through our city and to give attention to one school

902
01:16:51,967 --> 01:16:55,092
and not mention all the others is really not equitable.

903
01:16:55,512 --> 01:16:56,494
That's my first thought.

904
01:16:57,395 --> 01:17:05,927
And I would encourage you to look at that opportunity, to mark up those streets and avoid the consequence that we are seeing over on Tufts.

905
01:17:07,249 --> 01:17:08,751
The other point that

906
01:17:09,311 --> 01:17:26,425
gives me grave concern is that we are talking about eminent domain taking of private land for public safety and usage for bike paths and sidewalks and safe schools, which are all safe walking to school, which are all important.

907
01:17:26,865 --> 01:17:30,846
But at the end of the day, it's an eminent domain taking of public land.

908
01:17:31,366 --> 01:17:33,246
And that is a very slippery slope.

909
01:17:33,847 --> 01:17:38,588
So I would ask you, today it's this area, three months from now it may be another.

910
01:17:39,228 --> 01:17:44,929
Our highest level for public safety is the site formerly known as the Lawrence Memorial Hospital.

911
01:17:45,309 --> 01:17:47,269
Are you ready to take that by eminent domain?

912
01:17:48,210 --> 01:17:49,610
It is a very slippery slope.

913
01:17:50,070 --> 01:17:57,353
So what I would urge you to do is look at maybe marking up the space and seeing what the implications are before you open that Pandora's box.

914
01:17:57,873 --> 01:17:58,933
And I thank you for your time.

915
01:17:59,413 --> 01:17:59,753
Thank you.

916
01:18:02,214 --> 01:18:03,615
Please have your name and address for the record.

917
01:18:03,635 --> 01:18:10,977
Hi, my name is Melissa Miguel and I live on Bowen Ave and in full disclosure I just came here tonight to listen, wanted to see the new council, see how things are going.

918
01:18:11,437 --> 01:18:19,040
What I'm hearing tonight with this bike lane is alarming to me and it's what I've been a resident of Medford for 17 years and what Medford lacks is planning.

919
01:18:20,203 --> 01:18:23,405
We do not have a street and sidewalk reconstruction plan.

920
01:18:23,445 --> 01:18:25,847
We just do something because the state is giving us money.

921
01:18:25,907 --> 01:18:26,468
Let's do it.

922
01:18:27,108 --> 01:18:27,348
Right.

923
01:18:27,668 --> 01:18:31,871
How do you get to this three lane, this three block bike lane in front of the Brooks?

924
01:18:31,911 --> 01:18:36,855
Do we have a bicycle network plan that has identified slow, low volume?

925
01:18:37,255 --> 01:18:42,897
low-speed streets for these cyclists to get there, or we're just going to say, oh, on these three blocks in front of the Brooks School, you can get safely.

926
01:18:42,917 --> 01:18:45,497
But how the hell you get there, you're on your own.

927
01:18:46,158 --> 01:18:54,340
I ask this council to step back and look at the city as a whole and start making five-year plans for things like bike lanes.

928
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:59,882
I'm not saying I'm against the bike lane, but to throw, use that money from the state to do a bike network plan.

929
01:18:59,922 --> 01:19:01,002
The city of Cambridge has one.

930
01:19:03,845 --> 01:19:05,505
Point of information, Councilor Morrell.

931
01:19:06,126 --> 01:19:08,346
As I understand, we do have a bike network plan.

932
01:19:09,767 --> 01:19:11,587
I don't know how old it is, but I have seen it.

933
01:19:11,967 --> 01:19:13,868
There is a bike network plan that exists.

934
01:19:13,888 --> 01:19:16,848
So we're going to connect those three blocks to the bike network plan?

935
01:19:17,048 --> 01:19:19,349
And I'm not here to criticize, and I'm not here to compliment.

936
01:19:19,369 --> 01:19:22,510
I'm just here to say we need to take a step back.

937
01:19:22,610 --> 01:19:23,490
I live on Bowen Ave.

938
01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:27,651
If you drive down my street, we have the Grand Canyon in front of everybody's driveway on our street.

939
01:19:27,971 --> 01:19:32,112
And they come, and they fill it with cold patch, and that lasts about two days, and it goes away.

940
01:19:32,888 --> 01:19:38,131
Okay, I asked the city, I called the city engineer, can you tell me where the Chapter 90 funding is being spent?

941
01:19:38,412 --> 01:19:40,333
Can you tell me the last time Bowen Air was paved?

942
01:19:40,673 --> 01:19:43,115
Nobody has any idea, not a clue.

943
01:19:44,115 --> 01:19:58,125
So I just ask that when you're spending this money, you think about doing long-term planning and not plopping a three, and now what if the state doesn't give us any more money, we have no more money, and like you said, you have somebody now speeding down High Street because for three blocks they felt safe.

944
01:19:59,355 --> 01:20:13,346
Why don't you tell the bikes to get off of High Street and maybe take themselves down a street that's low volume and low speed, then come up the side street and make a safe crossing across High Street to get to the Brooks School, right?

945
01:20:13,526 --> 01:20:18,149
I don't know what those low volume, but from what everybody's saying right here, High Street is dangerous.

946
01:20:18,349 --> 01:20:21,051
So why are we encouraging cyclists to go down High Street?

947
01:20:22,833 --> 01:20:23,153
Good point.

948
01:20:23,782 --> 01:20:30,506
Okay, so I ask that we take a step back, tell the state this year, thank you for your money, but we'd like to use that for planning purposes.

949
01:20:31,286 --> 01:20:43,854
And I've lived here for 17 years, I have never spoken at a city council meeting, but for 17 years, I had high hopes for the new people on this council, and the new woman in the big office, and I have not seen any change in six weeks.

950
01:20:44,214 --> 01:20:49,137
Full disclosure, I was on the transition committee, I want to see Medford change for the positive.

951
01:20:49,257 --> 01:20:50,878
If that means bike lanes, sure.

952
01:20:51,778 --> 01:20:53,539
But we can't even pave a street in Medford.

953
01:20:54,199 --> 01:20:59,481
Then the cyclists are going to be complaining that they're cycling down potholes and rutted streets.

954
01:20:59,821 --> 01:21:03,842
We need to take a step back and start planning the future of this city.

955
01:21:05,023 --> 01:21:09,704
And I ask that we do a five-year infrastructure plan for our drainage, our sewer, our water.

956
01:21:10,084 --> 01:21:12,325
A five-year plan for our streets and sidewalks.

957
01:21:13,786 --> 01:21:18,887
And instead of just taking money from the state to put down three blocks of bike lane, I think it's a waste.

958
01:21:19,408 --> 01:21:20,448
And that's just my opinion.

959
01:21:21,313 --> 01:21:22,214
Thank you for listening to me.

960
01:21:22,234 --> 01:21:22,554
Thank you.

961
01:21:22,914 --> 01:21:23,835
Thank you for coming out tonight.

962
01:21:23,875 --> 01:21:24,075
Thank you.

963
01:21:24,095 --> 01:21:27,197
Appreciate it.

964
01:21:27,217 --> 01:21:28,938
Councilor Morrell, did you have one?

965
01:21:28,958 --> 01:21:30,579
Yeah, I could go.

966
01:21:31,179 --> 01:21:34,681
I don't want to make this a debate about bikes, which it seems it has turned into, but just a

967
01:21:35,750 --> 01:21:40,634
Many people who cycle and ride their bike to work are also own cars, drive cars.

968
01:21:41,374 --> 01:21:42,875
When they're biking, they're not in their car.

969
01:21:43,196 --> 01:21:45,337
They're not damaging the roads the same way a car does.

970
01:21:45,637 --> 01:21:48,059
They're not adding to congestion the same way a car does.

971
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:49,380
Bikes aren't perfect.

972
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:50,361
None of this is perfect.

973
01:21:50,561 --> 01:21:52,603
We're retrofitting old infrastructure.

974
01:21:52,883 --> 01:21:56,646
But it's a bigger issue.

975
01:21:57,767 --> 01:21:58,067
Thank you.

976
01:21:58,267 --> 01:21:59,248
Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

977
01:22:00,092 --> 01:22:00,792
Councilor Beers.

978
01:22:01,413 --> 01:22:02,753
Yeah, just a couple of things.

979
01:22:03,133 --> 01:22:07,895
I would love to spend this money on long-term planning, but we're not allowed to by the purposes of the project.

980
01:22:07,955 --> 01:22:08,976
It's been in for a few years.

981
01:22:09,376 --> 01:22:14,118
The Roberts also applied, but they were not accepted, I think, mainly because of the danger.

982
01:22:14,438 --> 01:22:16,739
I mean, it's a dangerous area by the Roberts as well.

983
01:22:16,959 --> 01:22:22,982
I think there were specifics to the Roberts case, not to the proposal, but to the area around there as to why it wasn't accepted.

984
01:22:23,022 --> 01:22:24,663
You'd have to ask the people who didn't accept it.

985
01:22:25,743 --> 01:22:28,145
But I completely agree with you we need long term planning.

986
01:22:29,546 --> 01:22:43,857
My understanding is that several of the plans that you mentioned that the mayor's office and the chief of staff are working on trying to get to a street and sidewalk plan and that that's at least my understanding is that they're working to get to that point.

987
01:22:45,339 --> 01:22:48,501
But they would need to update you on that and that is their job.

988
01:22:49,642 --> 01:22:50,383
But yes.

989
01:22:51,618 --> 01:23:02,422
In terms of this specific money and in terms of the applications for the other schools, other schools applied, it actually came from the schools with parents working with the administration of the schools.

990
01:23:03,503 --> 01:23:06,704
And yeah, this money can't be spent on anything else.

991
01:23:07,585 --> 01:23:15,688
So while I'd love to spend it on thinking bigger, this is the opportunity we have before us and I think we need to take it to make a street safer.

992
01:23:16,728 --> 01:23:18,809
And I just want to say that I agree with Councilor Knight.

993
01:23:18,849 --> 01:23:21,289
We need to tell the state thank you, but no thank you at this time.

994
01:23:21,849 --> 01:23:29,372
Because you're going to be encouraging cyclists to cycle on three streets that everybody has said is dangerous, and they only feel safe on three blocks.

995
01:23:29,412 --> 01:23:32,292
So I think at this time, we need to tell MassDOT thank you, but no thank you.

996
01:23:32,312 --> 01:23:34,433
The project does a lot for pedestrian safety as well.

997
01:23:35,073 --> 01:23:35,313
OK.

998
01:23:35,893 --> 01:23:36,734
You're entitled to your opinion.

999
01:23:36,754 --> 01:23:37,314
I'm entitled to mine.

1000
01:23:37,354 --> 01:23:37,714
Thank you.

1001
01:23:37,834 --> 01:23:38,154
Thank you.

1002
01:23:38,174 --> 01:23:41,035
On the motion, Mr. President.

1003
01:23:42,048 --> 01:23:47,570
on the motion of consular marks as amended by consular mark seconded by consular caviar.

1004
01:23:49,151 --> 01:23:53,012
All those in favor roll call vote has been requested.

1005
01:23:53,913 --> 01:23:55,493
Clerk her to be please call the roll.

1006
01:23:57,034 --> 01:23:57,274
Yes.

1007
01:23:58,334 --> 01:24:01,295
So the original paper was that this item be discussed.

1008
01:24:02,136 --> 01:24:05,777
Uh, clerk her to be as if you could please read the amendment.

1009
01:24:06,837 --> 01:24:10,859
Uh, Clark, you can please read the amendment.

1010
01:24:14,217 --> 01:24:30,985
Council Marx's amendment is to ask the city engineer to go back to MassDOT and revisit the elimination of 19 parking spaces to accommodate the bike lane and to ask MassDOT to add back to 19 spots and find a solution that doesn't impact parking.

1011
01:24:38,188 --> 01:24:41,830
On the motion of Council Marx, as amended by Council Marx, seconded by Councilor Carviello.

1012
01:24:42,868 --> 01:24:43,868
Clerk Carter-Bees, please call the roll.

1013
01:24:44,249 --> 01:24:44,749
Councilor Behrs?

1014
01:24:44,769 --> 01:24:44,829
Yes.

1015
01:24:46,910 --> 01:24:47,730
Vice President Carabiello?

1016
01:24:47,930 --> 01:24:48,070
Yes.

1017
01:24:48,951 --> 01:24:49,431
Councilor Knight?

1018
01:24:49,571 --> 01:24:49,771
Yes.

1019
01:24:50,432 --> 01:24:50,972
Councilor Marks?

1020
01:24:51,352 --> 01:24:51,572
Yes.

1021
01:24:52,092 --> 01:24:52,693
Councilor Morrell?

1022
01:24:52,933 --> 01:24:53,033
Yes.

1023
01:24:53,853 --> 01:24:54,614
Councilor Scarpelli?

1024
01:24:54,834 --> 01:24:55,014
Yes.

1025
01:24:55,274 --> 01:24:55,954
President Falco?

1026
01:24:56,174 --> 01:24:56,394
Yes.

1027
01:24:56,715 --> 01:24:58,876
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

1028
01:24:58,896 --> 01:25:05,859
Is that the only thing we have?

1029
01:25:05,879 --> 01:25:07,540
Two under suspension and the committee reports.

1030
01:25:13,213 --> 01:25:16,615
On the motion of Councilor Scott Kelly, seconded by Councilor Beers that.

1031
01:25:26,940 --> 01:25:32,943
While we're on to suspension.

1032
01:25:32,963 --> 01:25:42,208
20-073 offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council request an update including but not limited to a construction schedule on the status of the Tufts Square construction project.

1033
01:25:43,483 --> 01:25:44,004
Councilor Knight.

1034
01:25:44,725 --> 01:25:46,026
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1035
01:25:46,367 --> 01:25:51,633
As many of us are aware, there was a complete streets project that was started down at Tufts Square.

1036
01:25:52,334 --> 01:25:59,242
And it doesn't look to me as though this project is finished, but it doesn't look to me as though there's much work going on down there either, Mr. President.

1037
01:26:01,756 --> 01:26:03,459
The parking area has not been striped.

1038
01:26:03,799 --> 01:26:10,168
There's no shrubbery or any type of ballast or anything like that that I believe were part of the plan that were going to be put in there.

1039
01:26:10,208 --> 01:26:15,076
It looks like there's a problem with the gradient and pitch as well, Mr. President.

1040
01:26:15,096 --> 01:26:16,878
It looks like in a rainstorm the.

1041
01:26:18,053 --> 01:26:24,158
rain would puddle up quite a bit going down towards the Citizens Bank area of the parking lot over there.

1042
01:26:24,218 --> 01:26:36,128
So I'm hoping that we can get an update from the city administration, including but not limited to the construction schedule, where we are in the process, what percentage of the project is complete at this point in time.

1043
01:26:37,248 --> 01:26:47,853
Ultimately, Mr. President, if you think about that little Tufts Square area, and you think about all the businesses that were there, it's a very historic area, very important to the heritage and history of Medford.

1044
01:26:48,374 --> 01:26:58,919
I was just talking to a friend of mine just the other day on Golden Ave, Michael Price, who showed me a newspaper article of Dolly's Beauty Salon down right there in Tufts Square.

1045
01:26:59,199 --> 01:27:05,322
And Dolly, his mother, was the youngest hair salon owner ever licensed

1046
01:27:06,596 --> 01:27:08,517
in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts at age 15.

1047
01:27:09,157 --> 01:27:12,098
Mr. President, she was a business owner at age 15 right there in Tufts Square.

1048
01:27:12,898 --> 01:27:26,642
So it's my hope that we can remember the good things of that square and the good businesses and the good legacies that were left behind by honoring them a little bit more with the completion of this construction project, Mr. President, and also when the time is right

1049
01:27:27,235 --> 01:27:48,012
Hopefully maybe a history board or a story board down there, but at this point in time I would just like to ask for an update from the administration as to what's going on with the tough square project where we are and When it's going to be complete and what the construction schedule looks like Thank You console night console beers I'd just like to amend this paper to ask the administration also if they have any data or information on the impact of the change in

1050
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:57,943
intersection orientation on traffic, and also if they have any data or anecdotes on the impact of the Broadway bus lane on there.

1051
01:27:59,643 --> 01:28:00,024
Repeat it.

1052
01:28:00,184 --> 01:28:02,584
If you could please repeat that to the clerk.

1053
01:28:02,804 --> 01:28:03,685
Sure.

1054
01:28:03,925 --> 01:28:17,389
Amendment to ask if the change in the intersection has, if they have data on the impact on traffic, and then also if there has been a traffic impact from the Broadway bus lanes installed by the city of Somerville.

1055
01:28:25,531 --> 01:28:30,195
Okay, on the motion of Council Knight, seconded by Councilor Scott Kelly, as amended by Councilor Beers.

1056
01:28:31,577 --> 01:28:32,237
All those in favor?

1057
01:28:32,678 --> 01:28:32,858
Aye.

1058
01:28:32,938 --> 01:28:33,559
All those opposed?

1059
01:28:33,599 --> 01:28:34,339
The motion passes.

1060
01:28:39,024 --> 01:28:39,684
Councilor Caviello.

1061
01:28:44,329 --> 01:28:45,390
Law warrant the suspension.

1062
01:28:55,509 --> 01:28:58,011
Should you turn on his mic first?

1063
01:28:58,452 --> 01:28:59,953
My mic's still on, just FYI.

1064
01:29:01,534 --> 01:29:01,995
Here we go.

1065
01:29:04,216 --> 01:29:04,777
I can shut it off.

1066
01:29:04,797 --> 01:29:06,639
Thank you.

1067
01:29:06,659 --> 01:29:17,328
2-0-0-7-2, offered by President Falco, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council sends its deep and sincere condolences to the family of Jonathan Davis on his recent passing.

1068
01:29:18,408 --> 01:29:21,831
Mr. Davis was the Chief Financial Officer of the MBTA for more than 20 years.

1069
01:29:23,348 --> 01:29:29,870
He also served as the T's acting general manager and the chief financial officer for the city of Marlton.

1070
01:29:31,010 --> 01:29:31,791
President Falco.

1071
01:29:32,811 --> 01:29:33,951
Thank you, Vice President Camarillo.

1072
01:29:34,572 --> 01:29:34,852
Hold on.

1073
01:29:34,932 --> 01:29:35,092
Okay.

1074
01:29:45,927 --> 01:29:47,208
Thank you, Councilor Caviello.

1075
01:29:47,368 --> 01:29:52,411
I just wanted to, thoughts and prayers go to the Davis family.

1076
01:29:52,631 --> 01:29:55,072
Jonathan, I used to see him on the bus.

1077
01:29:55,272 --> 01:30:00,835
I used to take the, well, still take the 326 home at night with the 325, and I'd see him on the bus.

1078
01:30:01,395 --> 01:30:06,138
Very kind gentleman, worked for the MBTA for a long time, and was the,

1079
01:30:08,039 --> 01:30:14,947
You know, he was the acting general manager for a while, and when he got on the bus, you'd never know that he was the acting general manager.

1080
01:30:15,368 --> 01:30:17,029
He would just jump on like everybody else.

1081
01:30:17,930 --> 01:30:28,583
Very, very nice person, easy to talk to, great guy, and just wanted to, you know, just offer thoughts and prayers to his family, so thank you.

1082
01:31:05,305 --> 01:31:05,425
I know.

1083
01:31:19,115 --> 01:31:21,477
Reports of committees, Tuesday, February 11th, 2026 p.m.

1084
01:31:21,497 --> 01:31:22,798
in room 207, Council Office, Memphis City Hall.

1085
01:31:30,842 --> 01:31:38,327
The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the Safe Routes to School project on High Street and the minor adjustments to the right-of-way.

1086
01:31:38,347 --> 01:31:44,251
We had a, basically had a discussion with the,

1087
01:31:46,360 --> 01:31:57,890
Let's see, the traffic engineer, the engineering department, as well as MassDOT, and we just talked about that in our previous discussion just a couple minutes ago.

1088
01:31:58,571 --> 01:32:08,179
But they detailed a plan as to what was going to be happening in that area and what they were trying to do with regard to bike lanes and bump outs for the sidewalks and crosswalks.

1089
01:32:16,027 --> 01:32:20,588
That was basically the purpose of that meeting and what happened during that meeting.

1090
01:32:21,989 --> 01:32:27,191
On the motion of Councilor Caviello, seconded by Councilor Mox to approve the committee report.

1091
01:32:27,771 --> 01:32:28,631
All those in favor?

1092
01:32:28,911 --> 01:32:29,671
All those opposed?

1093
01:32:29,711 --> 01:32:30,672
The motion passes.

1094
01:32:30,692 --> 01:32:35,273
20-017, committee of the whole meeting report.

1095
01:32:36,153 --> 01:32:37,434
Wednesday, February 12, 2020 at 5.45 p.m.

1096
01:32:37,454 --> 01:32:38,954
Room 207, Council Office, Memphis City Hall.

1097
01:32:44,832 --> 01:32:56,900
The purpose of that meeting was for the council to meet with Mayor Mungo-Curran to continue its discussion of our legislative priorities for 2020.

1098
01:32:57,740 --> 01:33:10,109
We had a discussion about everything from adding headcount to various departments within our city, meeting with department heads pre-budget, talking about

1099
01:33:12,592 --> 01:33:18,593
Talking about the budget in general, talking about the census.

1100
01:33:18,613 --> 01:33:20,194
We talked about the census for a few minutes.

1101
01:33:20,894 --> 01:33:26,335
And the hope is that the budget will be drafted earlier than normal and hopefully will be to us in May.

1102
01:33:27,115 --> 01:33:31,976
And let's see, we talked about technology as well.

1103
01:33:32,796 --> 01:33:34,697
And we talked about the city solicitor's office.

1104
01:33:39,394 --> 01:33:43,497
And the mayor is interviewing candidates for a number of positions in the city.

1105
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:51,282
And that's a brief synopsis of the meeting.
