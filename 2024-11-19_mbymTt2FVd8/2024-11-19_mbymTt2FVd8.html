    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2307.049s">Yeah,</a>  we're not going to be wearing microphones to talk over the music. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2310.55s">So</a>  it'll be sort of like <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2311.98s">We'll</a>  give instructions. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2313.241s">The</a>  music will be down. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2314.301s">We'll</a>  probably turn it up a little just to give a little bit of energy for people working out. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2318.843s">But</a>  it won't be all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2320.364s">And</a>  as Mike said, it's all being re-insulated and redone. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2323.866s">But</a>  it's also like thick concrete walls as well.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2326.767s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2327.327s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2329.048s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2330.629s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2331.788s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2333.088s">It's</a>  always good to see the vape depot being replaced by a gym, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2337.029s">I</a>  mean, I think it shows we're coming full circle down there on Salem Street when it comes to this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2341.69s">I</a>  certainly don't have a problem with the petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2344.171s">However,</a>  where it's a 5 o'clock in the morning application, it does raise some concerns to the quality of life of the residents in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2351.632s">So</a>  Mr. President, I certainly have no problem voting in favor of this this evening provided that <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2357.067s">We</a>  amend the application that the permit would go with the business and not the address. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2361.671s">And</a>  that we put a 90 and a 180 day review on the special permit, Mr. President, to be sure that any issues in the neighborhood can be addressed in a timely fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2370.678s">As</a>  operations progress and business gets busier and you got half of the city of Medford in there beating down your door wanting to become members at your gym. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2379.024s">We</a>  just want to make sure that the quality of life issues in the neighborhood are protected. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2383.087s">This</a>  is common practice, we do this quite a bit where we put a 90 day review or a 180 day review on a special permit application for extended hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2390.811s">And</a>  we also make sure that it goes with your business name as opposed to the address so that if you vacate and another entity comes in, that those extended hours aren't grandfathered in. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2400.537s">So</a>  just a little explanation as to what the motions were that were made. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2403.499s">I</a>  certainly wish you all the best of luck and don't have any opposition. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2406.593s">To</a>  them putting in their personal fitness studio down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2409.254s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2410.134s">However,</a>  we have to protect the interest of the neighborhood as well And I think that this is a good compromise.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2414.935s">Thank</a>  you console night.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2415.815s">I</a>  offer them in Thank You console night console skypelly I Yield I my fellow Councilor mentioned what I wanted to propose. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2429.797s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2430.077s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2430.557s">Thank</a>  you Any other questions from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2434.182s">Okay,</a>  on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Knight, as amended by Councilor Knight, the amendment would be that the permit goes with the business and that there will be a review after 90 and 180 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2451.171s">On</a>  that motion, Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2460.015s">Councilor</a>  Bears? <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2460.876s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2461.596s">Vice</a>  President Carriano? <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2462.617s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Mike Denton]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2475.273s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2476.374s">So</a>  should we come back in 90 days?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2480.297s">Oh,</a>  okay.</p>

    <p>[Mike Denton]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2488.482s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2493.858s">Motions,</a>  orders, and resolutions 20-068 offered by Councilor Morell be it resolved that the city administration provide an update on a storefront improvement program to support businesses in improving the curb appeal of our squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2512.619s">Councilor</a>  Morell.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2513.565s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2514.906s">So</a>  recently had a local business owner reach out and say that they had reached out to the city about a storefront improvement program, and they were told that we no longer run the program or we no longer issue funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2525.973s">So</a>  these are local programs that provide financial support to businesses looking to improve or update their public facing. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2531.777s">Facades</a>  I did reach out to Ashley Williams the CDBG administrator for the city to see if we could find out more She said in her time with the city three and a half years The program hasn't been run and it was kind of hard-pressed to find the last time this program has been run I actually did find reference to it in a job posting from 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2550.371s">So</a>  it seems there was previous interest in this but several our neighboring communities run these type of programs where they either offer a 0% deferred payment loan or a <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2559.517s">or</a>  matching grant funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2560.938s">And</a>  a lot of times these funds are small. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2563.299s">In</a>  many communities, they're capped around $2,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2565.68s">And</a>  I think with many of our local businesses operating on razor-thin margins, this program with small amounts of funds would actually make all the difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2574.825s">So</a>  these programs are funded a number of different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2577.287s">So</a>  depending if it is a spot basis for a business where decay or blight can be identified, CDBG would possibly fund that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2585.901s">Same</a>  thing with businesses being in a certain census track, which we might not qualify for. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2590.623s">But</a>  I think there's also the option where, with the business district parking funds that, as we were updated, I believe, have been found, for lack of a better word. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2599.646s">Perhaps</a>  this is a way where we can directly fund businesses or support businesses to increase that curb appeal and beautification that we talk about so often in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2610.99s">In</a>  this chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2612.352s">So</a>  really all I'm asking for is the city to provide an update on the sass of the program because that's Some hard to find and just to understand the level of interest so that as businesses do look for this program because this program does exist in Cambridge and blue burn and Worcester and still win in a number of surrounding communities as businesses come into Medford or they've been here for a long time and they're looking for this kind of support. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2632.348s">We're</a>  able to give them an answer, point them in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2635.631s">And</a>  also to that end, there is the public meeting on March 11th for the CDBG five-year consolidated plan and one-year annual action plan where they are seeking public input. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2644.397s">So</a>  I think having this update from the city from the status or interest in a program like this would be timely, understanding that public meeting is coming up on the 11th.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2734.597s">Councilor</a>  Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2735.978s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2737.5s">The</a>  Medford City Council had Committee of the Whole last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2741.684s">We</a>  met with the Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2742.945s">Department</a>  of Transportation, as well as City Engineer, and they gave us an update on the Safe Routes to School project, which the Brooks School sought funding from the state back some <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2759.252s">two</a>  or three years I think now, and they just received $1 million for upgrades for safe routes along High Street, which includes Hastings Lane, Mystic Street, and Walcott Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2774.943s">And</a>  some of the updates they're looking about curb extensions, bump outs, pedestrian lights in that particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2783.71s">As</a>  part of this project, we were told by <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2787.238s">Mass</a>  Department of Transportation, that there will also be some land takings in that particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2794.463s">And</a>  the City of Medford is now reaching out to many of the homeowners along High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2801.008s">In</a>  addition, Mr. President, there is also going to be a bike lane that will be put on the southbound side of High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2812.424s">And</a>  the bike lane goes from Auburn Street all the way up to Woburn Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2819.248s">And</a>  it starts and ends in that particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2825.711s">On</a>  the other side of the street, they will have a lane that could be used, I guess, for both bikes and cars mutually. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2833.998s">Just</a>  recently, Mr. President, the Traffic Commission also held a meeting because approval would be required by the Traffic Commission to eliminate some of the spots. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2845.662s">We</a>  were told at last week's meeting, last Wednesday, that they numbered out the spots to be 60 on-street parking spots from Auburn Street all the way up to Hastings Lane. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2861.067s">And</a>  of the 60, <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2863.467s">19,</a>  according to their numbers, were going to be eliminated on the southbound side. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2871.17s">Now,</a>  over the last week, Mr. President, I, like many members behind this reel, have received a number of phone calls, residents that did attend the 2 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2882.153s">Traffic</a>  Commission meeting and <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2886.624s">They</a>  weren't quite sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2888.345s">They</a>  thought they were going there to listen to a presentation about this new Safe Routes project. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2895.09s">And</a>  unbeknownst to them, there was an actual vote taken by the Traffic Commission to eliminate spots in front of people's homes that have been there for four, five, six decades, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2909.501s">I</a>  don't think anyone behind this reel <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2911.763s">is</a>  against safe routes, and I think I could speak for my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2915.684s">I</a>  think we all welcome that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2917.204s">We</a>  all welcome state funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2919.205s">Anytime</a>  you can get additional funding, that's great, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2922.706s">But</a>  I do have concerns, Mr. President, that this project may not move forward if we're not able to reach a compromise. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2931.36s">And</a>  I think the best way to do it is at this point, where it's still in the early stages. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2936.322s">And</a>  I'm formally requesting tonight that we ask our city engineer to go back to the Department of Transportation regarding the southbound bike lane that only is about two city, three city blocks. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2952.129s">That</a>  they revisit the elimination, Mr. President, of those spots. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2958.172s">to</a>  accommodate a five foot bike lane that leads to nowhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2963.894s">It</a>  ends, it starts, it ends. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2966.734s">And</a>  like I said, three city blocks. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2969.275s">And</a>  we were told that the Department of Transportation will only entertain projects and only fund projects if it includes bike lanes. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2980.477s">But</a>  in my opinion, Mr. President, it makes no sense to have a bike lane that doesn't continue on. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2987.479s">I</a>  asked a question that night, well, if it stops all the way up at Hastings Lane, where does the bike go after that? <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2996.642s">And</a>  they said the bike will continue to ride on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3000.19s">Because</a>  under the laws of Massachusetts, bikes and cars are allowed to have equal access to the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3012.192s">So</a>  I think we can head this off, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3015.013s">I</a>  don't want to be at the last minute attending to neighborhood concerns when they're going to be asking for a vote of this council to improve land takings, which will make the project even go further down. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3027.235s">So</a>  I would ask at this point that we intervene, we send a letter to our city engineer, let him know that we feel more comfortable. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3036.118s">that</a>  the project, while it's in the early stages, be revisited to add those 19 spots that we're going to lose and come out with another solution that doesn't impact parking, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3051.592s">Many</a>  of the residents were told, well, if you live on a high street and they're removing that spot, just park across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3057.988s">And</a>  one of the residents that called me said, well, my 80-year-old mother really shouldn't be crossing a very busy street that you're already saying this concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3068.248s">and</a>  having her walk another 300 yards to maybe get up to the pedestrian light to cross over to get to her house, where we've had this spot in front of my house for five decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3079.371s">So</a>  I can see where they're coming from, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3081.691s">Other</a>  residents on Mystic Street that contacted me were concerned that by eliminating these particular spots, especially next to the Brooks School, that you're just going to take people that are regularly parking on High Street and push them into the secondary roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3097.375s">which</a>  I think is a concern for residents already in a busy area, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3103.439s">So</a>  I would ask that in the form of a motion that we send it to the city engineer and have him contact DOT regarding the bike lane and other options available so we can continue to have the 60 spots that residents count on right now, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3120.69s">in</a>  a very cramped area, not just because of the school, because of the public transportation in the West Method area, because it's right out of the business district in West Method, and that area is very congested as is. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3134.557s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

<a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3170.888s">Where</a>  are they going to go, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3173.15s">You</a>  know, I don't see the need for a path to nowhere, especially when we just spent how many millions of dollars extending a community path one block <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3185.051s">away</a>  at Memorial Park with crosswalk right at Auburn Street, crosswalk right at Winthrop Street that runs actually all the way from Medford Square all the way to the Brooks School, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3198.301s">So</a>  we actually have a bike path, a community path that's in place now that's been constructed. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3202.323s">We</a>  all took pictures next to the sign when they did the ribbon cutting. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3205.205s">And</a>  it's there. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3206.126s">It's</a>  there. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3206.466s">And</a>  it's underutilized, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3208.208s">But</a>  I think that that's a good compromise. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3209.749s">I</a>  mean, ultimately, we have a community path that's one block away. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3213.351s">We</a>  have residents in this community that have invested their life savings to purchase these homes, and their quality of life is going to be impacted by it. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3220.515s">You</a>  know, we talk about zoning and ordinances and taking away inner court parking, Mr. President, inner court parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3227.378s">You</a>  know, you're not allowed to park inside the front, the inner court of your house, but they'll come down and they'll put a bike lane right in front of your house, and then you won't have any place to put your car. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3236.302s">So</a>  where's it going to go? <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3237.062s">It's</a>  going to go to Mystic Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3238.143s">It's</a>  going to go to Mystic Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3239.363s">It's</a>  going to go to Auburn Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3240.724s">It's</a>  going to go to Piedmont Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3241.945s">It's</a>  going to go to... <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3243.246s">All</a>  the ancillary secondary roads that people can't find a place to park their car, they're going to put them in the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3248.954s">Now,</a>  just last Wednesday, I had the opportunity to go to the Brooks School for a wonderful winter concert, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3255.343s">And</a>  I think I'm confident in saying that my kids are never going to win a Grammy. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3259.108s">But</a>  when I got there, I had to park my car, and it was, there's 100 kids in the Brooks School's kindergarten class this year, and it was the kindergarten concert. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3268.058s">So</a>  there were a number of families that were there, 100 families. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3270.16s">So</a>  you can imagine what the parking was like at the Brooks School during a regular school day, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3274.005s">I</a>  had to park almost in front of Councilor Caraviello's house on Prescott Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3279.268s">to</a>  go to the concert. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3280.469s">And</a>  that's with the parking on High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3282.911s">So</a>  as events happen in our schools, as our school population grows, those spots are going to become more and more valuable. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3289.035s">So</a>  I can't agree more with Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3291.357s">You</a>  know, I think we need to take a look at this and figure out a solution that's a compromise that allows the residents to maintain their quality of life while also implementing the Safe Routes to School project. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3300.544s">You</a>  know, a path that starts here and ends there and doesn't go anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3304.107s">I</a>  don't see the benefit, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3305.808s">I</a>  really don't.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3307.409s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3310.572s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3312.253s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3312.994s">I</a>  thank Councilor Marks for bringing this forward and Councilor Knight for adding his input. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3318.757s">I</a>  think that, not to be redundant, but there are some great safety initiatives in place with the safe routes. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3325.882s">You</a>  know, I love the Woburn Street Island. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3327.943s">I</a>  think that's something that's really needed, a crosswalk in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3332.406s">And</a>  you'd hate to throw away <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3336.008s">you</a>  know, a great plan for a few sticking points. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3339.849s">But</a>  I will tell you, the phone calls I did receive as well and emails are the same issues and concerns where you're talking about safety being the number one concern and you are, I had a phone call from an 80-year-old resident that had that same concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3356.934s">response</a>  saying that it's safe routes. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3359.716s">Now</a>  I have to park across the street if I want to park, and I have to cross one of the major throughways. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3367.221s">Like</a>  I said, I won't be redundant, but I support this 100%. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3371.383s">I</a>  think to revisit this is very important, and I think we need to really take a hard stop and to revisit this, so thank you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3381.529s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3384.651s">Councilor</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3385.885s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3388.347s">First,</a>  I want to acknowledge definitely that we need to make sure that we have the best community process possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3393.091s">And</a>  I want to acknowledge the city engineer and the traffic engineer's outreach to many houses and families in the area, both the folks who are having takings, the folks who have issues with walls, as we heard extensively last meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3407.548s">And</a>  I think, absolutely, we need to make every possible action we can to accommodate people with disabilities, people with handicap parking, 80-year-olds who really need access to their home. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3418.215s">But</a>  there's a few things here. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3419.315s">I</a>  think the first thing to say is that this is 100% state and federal money. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3423.558s">This</a>  project doesn't use any city dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3426.239s">So</a>  I just want to put that out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3427.44s">And</a>  it's not matching. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3428.581s">It's</a>  not additional. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3429.341s">This</a>  is a million dollars we won't otherwise have. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3431.963s">And</a>  no city money will be going towards it. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3436.603s">So</a>  a few things, one, the studies done by the traffic engineer and the city engineer showed that much of the parking on the south side of High Street does go underused most of the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3450.155s">That's</a>  not to say there aren't cases and specifics. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3453.472s">kindergarten</a>  concerts and certain people who park in front of their houses of a certain age, but that the statistics showed that most of that parking was going underutilized or unutilized completely. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3464.516s">And</a>  then just this bike path to nowhere thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3468.298s">You</a>  might not think I ride a bike, and I've never ridden a bike on High Street, but I have a lot of friends who do bike, and <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3474.923s">That's</a>  actually the one place on High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3476.765s">If</a>  I had to pick anywhere on High Street between the Arlington Rotary and the Winthrop Street Rotary to put a bike lane, it would be exactly where this bike lane is. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3484.692s">It's</a>  the highest slope uphill in a place where traffic coming across the hill is obstructed view. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3490.598s">You</a>  can't see people coming up the hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3492.6s">And</a>  you need to separate out bike traffic and street traffic or else you're going to get in a situation where you have bike traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3498.565s">slowing</a>  up to 10, five miles an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3501.686s">You</a>  try huffing a bike all the way up the hill from West Medford Square to the top of the hill past Auburn Street, you're gonna be biking pretty slow. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3508.969s">And</a>  the point of this bike lane is to separate out the traffic at exactly the point at which the speed of the bikes and the speeds of the car traffic are gonna be at the most disparate. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3516.411s">So</a>  it's not really a path to nowhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3518.273s">It's</a>  saying that if you're on share road shared lanes everywhere else, this is the one spot of the road where you actually want to separate out the traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3525.761s">So</a>  that's just the bike. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3527.743s">That's</a>  the engineering behind it. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3530.545s">And</a>  so I just want to put out there, it's not really a path to nowhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3532.788s">It's</a>  actually putting a bike lane in one of the spots where it's safest.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3535.51s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3541.33s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3542.691s">You</a>  know, the report that was done spoke about the number of spots and how their utilization rate is pretty low in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3553.335s">Anyone</a>  that would drive, I don't know when they did this report, I don't know who did the study, but anyone that's familiar with that area would know the southbound, maybe not all the way up to Auburn Street, but further down, is always packed with cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3566.581s">So</a>  that's number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3568.142s">Secondly,</a>  Mr. President, has there been any report or indication how many bikes are actually using this particular area? <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3577.027s">I</a>  haven't heard anything about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3578.888s">And</a>  to me, to have a bike lane that ends at the top of Auburn and then going down a windy rest of a high street is <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3588.873s">far</a>  more of a public safety concern when that lane ends, Mr. President, than having a fake lane for three city blocks. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3596.779s">And</a>  I think the area that would be a concern is not in that particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3601.483s">It</a>  would be what happens after that, Mr. President, because the bike lane ends, as Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, right where the new intersection will be with Woburn. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3611.861s">So</a>  they're creating a new island there that's going to be like a fork in the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3615.343s">That's</a>  where my problem is with this particular bike lane, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3620.845s">I</a>  think you're setting up bike riders for failure in this particular area with a false sense of security. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3627.268s">That's</a>  all I wanted to add, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3628.649s">Point</a>  of information, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3631.19s">I</a>  think if you ask bike riders, they might disagree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3634.931s">I</a>  completely agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3635.792s">I</a>  think we should, the windy section between Winthrop Street and Woburn Street, that'd be great, but that's not in the scope of this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3642.055s">So</a>  I don't think we should throw the baby out with the bathwater here. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3645.297s">This</a>  is going to make the street safer. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3647.238s">It's</a>  a dangerous street. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3648.939s">And</a>  if we're saying that this is the end all be all and we kill it over this and something happens, God forbid, I think that's on us. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3654.481s">So</a>  I'm just saying here, <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3656.647s">We</a>  shouldn't, I agree, we should talk to folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3658.888s">I'm</a>  fine moving the process forward, but if it comes down to the federal and state government saying we will not provide you with this money if you want this change, I think we really need to think hard about that because we're talking about the safety of a major thoroughfare.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3672.294s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3675.295s">I</a>  think the funding sources are relevant at some point when, you know, well the feds are going to give us a million bucks, so let's impact the quality of life of these residents because it's not tax dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3686.283s">You</a>  know, I mean, the million bucks is the million bucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3688.605s">They're</a>  going to leave it. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3689.245s">Tomorrow,</a>  we're going to be just as good as we were yesterday without it. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3691.706s">You</a>  know, things aren't going to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3693.127s">The</a>  only way things are going to change is if we take it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3695.769s">The</a>  only way things are going to change is if we take the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3697.61s">So</a>  let's sit down. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3698.871s">Excuse</a>  me, I have the microphone. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3700.852s">So,</a>  Mr. President, ultimately, you know what I mean, I agree with Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3704.054s">We</a>  need to have a discussion about this, and we need to figure out what we can do to protect people's quality of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3707.617s">Maybe</a>  that's allowing in-accord parking in areas where bike lanes take away parking in front of their home. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3714.015s">That's</a>  an option, that's a solution, but it's something we need to talk about before we start going. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3717.898s">We've</a>  already put a bike lane down Winthrop Street, and we have a resident on Winthrop Street that every 90 days is putting an application in before the traffic commission asking them to take it out so we can park in front of his house. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3727.285s">So</a>  that's the reality of the situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3729.507s">It</a>  sounds great. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3730.167s">Yeah,</a>  we're making everybody safer. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3731.408s">These</a>  bike lanes are making everybody safer. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3732.949s">No</a>  one's ever going to get in a bike accident again. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3734.67s">Not</a>  the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3735.731s">Not</a>  the case.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3742.22s">Yeah,</a>  I mean, again, I just think we will be worse off if something happens, and right now we are worse off because people drive 45 miles an hour down High Street, and it's incredibly dangerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3751.465s">So</a>  I just want to make that clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3754.507s">That's</a>  the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3755.188s">It's</a>  a very wide street. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3756.949s">This</a>  project would make it much safer, safer to cross at all hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3761.251s">Sure,</a>  let's reassess the parking, but I think the idea of a bike lane to nowhere and the rhetoric we're hearing here is a little overblown, and we really <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3767.738s">If</a>  the point of this study is to make sure that we have all our ducks in a row and we know everything, let's go with what the studies have said and what the traffic engineer and the city engineer have been saying, you know, if we really want to get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3779.962s">And</a>  I don't find that the bike lane-to-nowhere thing is grounded in any sort of evidence. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3785.984s">Yes,</a>  we have another unsafe situation half a mile down the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3790.006s">We</a>  should address this as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3791.346s">But</a>  if you're a biker biking up High Street towards the eastbound east, <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3797.546s">I'm</a>  pretty sure most bikers would say they'd rather have a separated lane so they're not worried someone's going to come up at 35 miles an hour and hit them from behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3805.033s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3805.733s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3809.416s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3813.28s">I</a>  just want to clarify, it's not a separated lane. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3817.563s">That's</a>  a big clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3820.626s">It's</a>  its own lane, but it's not a separated lane. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3823.188s">It's</a>  not separated by anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3825.907s">It's</a>  its own lane, but there's a distinction.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3828.689s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3832.411s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3834.592s">A</a>  separately marked lane.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3836.693s">Separately</a>  marked lane, okay.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3837.614s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3838.454s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3842.616s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3843.717s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3844.518s">Well,</a>  that happens to be the neighborhood where I live, and while everybody else was getting the phone calls, I was getting the people in my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3854.419s">One</a>  of the biggest complaints I heard was a lot of people were never even notified of this, even people on High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3860.664s">So</a>  I know they said that they notified people, but I think maybe they just notified the people that they were taking land from. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3868.37s">But</a>  I heard people from Mystic Street and Austin Street, and they said there was no notification of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3875.735s">And</a>  the few that did get the notification couldn't go to the meeting at 2 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3880.302s">So</a>  that's also part of the issue here, too, aside from taking the parking space away. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3887.247s">So</a>  this next meeting, I think there should be a little bit more notification of the neighbors, not just on High Street, but maybe some of the houses on Mystic and Hastings, where all these cars are going to end up going at some point. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3905.079s">So</a>  like I say, <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3907.774s">Please</a>  make sure that there is proper notification for this next meeting, and not at 2 o'clock in the afternoon either.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3914.519s">Yes,</a>  if I may, that meeting was scheduled by the Traffic Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3921.284s">We've</a>  all had issues with when they schedule meetings because they're always at 2 p.m., which to me is just, it just gives such a disservice because most of the population can't make it at 2 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3931.872s">So</a>  I'm in complete agreement with you on that.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3934.475s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3935.517s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3935.857s">Got</a>  some caviar.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3940.039s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3942.7s">I</a>  support exploring this a little bit further. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3944.261s">I</a>  was remiss during that meeting and understanding the handicapped spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3949.424s">I'm</a>  sure there are no handicapped spaces that would be removed as part of this that are proposed to be removed, but just understanding that those spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3956.898s">and</a>  the accessible spaces do remain for the people that need them. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3960.282s">To</a>  the point of this debate over the bike lane to nowhere, I think people are missing the point that this is a safe route to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3965.869s">So</a>  that lane is right around the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3967.571s">The</a>  idea is that children will be in that safe, protected bike lane and get to the school safely. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3973.038s">Adults</a>  can then merge into traffic bike riders can then merge into traffic as they are used to in many points through many cities I understand the residents who are concerned about having to cross the street if they have to park across the street The point of this project is to make that street safer so that people can cross so that people as they drive through that corridor <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3991.697s">they</a>  see bikes, they see pedestrians, they see cars, they understand this isn't an area that I just fly through. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3996.861s">This</a>  is an area that has the flashing crossing right now, that has a crossing guard, and you can go to that area in the mornings and watch the crossing guard almost get hit by cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4007.209s">So</a>  I think we are running the risk of losing this money by not being able to see the forest through the trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4017.061s">And</a>  people talk about not having money to do things in Medford and we have a million dollars to make these streets safer, to make the streets safer in front of our school, to support children getting to school, to support alternative transportation to school, to remove some of the cars from the area because people are walking, because people are biking. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4034.088s">And</a>  we're looking for ways to lose this money. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4037.01s">So</a>  I do support exploring it further, seeing if there are options where we can come to a compromise. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4042.572s">But</a>  I think we are not seeing the bigger picture here. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4046.555s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4047.155s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Morell.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4049.176s">Councilor</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4050.336s">Yeah,</a>  and just another point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4051.877s">I</a>  believe that the folks from MassDOT and the city engineer said that they permit for Safe Routes to School over a five-year period, 15 to 20 projects are approved during that time, and there were at least double the applications of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4065.401s">It</a>  was an incredibly selective process. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4067.722s">We</a>  were one of, I believe, three projects in the whole state to be permitted, at least that's my recollection from the meeting in that year. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4076.082s">A</a>  lot of people did a lot of work to get to this point, including a lot of parents who send their kids to the Brooks School.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4081.206s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4082.087s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4084.249s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello is up next. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4086.37s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4090.433s">It's</a>  lit here. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4090.913s">I</a>  don't think anybody is looking to stop the project or just back away from it. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4095.795s">I</a>  think we're looking to revisit it and see if we can make some modifications. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4099.776s">I</a>  think that's all that we're, I think that's all my councilors are asking for is let's see what we can do to make a happy medium to keep the residents happy and the kids going to school happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4109.36s">So,</a>  I don't, I say, I don't think we're looking to stop it.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4111.861s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Morell.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4116.39s">I</a>  did clarify with the city engineer that this funding is based on the multimodal. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4122.076s">So</a>  it's walking and biking. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4123.658s">So</a>  the compromise has to include biking in some way.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4127.622s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4129.404s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4131.526s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4132.307s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4134.75s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4135.671s">And</a>  that was when I made my opening statement to see if we can come up with an alternative. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4140.333s">And</a>  it's our job as elected officials to also represent the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4144.995s">And</a>  I think that's what we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4146.276s">And</a>  the reason why I brought it up now, Mr. President, so we wouldn't be bringing the issue up at the last hour when everything is all set in stone, all the land takings are signed off, and then they need a vote of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4157.622s">This</a>  gives them ample time to revisit the process, Mr. President, and find out what we can do to accommodate the residents that have a hardship, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4167.224s">That's</a>  all we're asking here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4168.684s">We're</a>  not asking to stop the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4171.184s">We're</a>  not asking to give money back. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4173.445s">You</a>  know, that's a red herring. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4174.585s">No</a>  one's asking for that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4176.745s">We're</a>  asking to safeguard residents that contact us and have every right to do so because it's a quality of life issue that's impacting them, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4186.674s">You</a>  know, so any project worth its weight, Mr. President, needs to be properly vetted. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4191.238s">The</a>  fact that the state may come in and say, well, the federal government, this is how it's going to work, that's fine for them, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4197.683s">Then</a>  it's up to us as a community to stand up and say, this works for us, and then comes for a compromise. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4203.307s">That's</a>  all I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4204.888s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4205.909s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4207.931s">Again,</a>  I think that was my initial input with this is that it's not something that we want to eliminate. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4217.856s">but</a>  it's looking for alternatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4219.157s">And</a>  I think that there could be something as simple as notifying those residents that might be elderly that do qualify for handicap placards that never had an issue with that in the past that can now apply for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4231.607s">Or</a>  maybe it could be something that you look at different times where parking overnight might be an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4239.013s">That</a>  might be the biggest issue with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4240.855s">And</a>  maybe making it so when it's the most dangerous times that <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4246.037s">they</a>  can look at different parking restrictions. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4249.278s">So</a>  there's so many different variations to look at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4252.239s">And</a>  again, I don't want anybody to be confused with my input with eliminating something, or saying we don't want this money, or we don't want to keep our bicyclists safe, or we don't want our students at the Brooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4264.862s">Because</a>  to be honest with you, I got a lot of phone calls from parents from the Brooks that had some concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4271.484s">And</a>  one of the concerns with what Councilor Knight said is that when <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4275.405s">they</a>  do have a concern with, or an issue with the school, or they have something, there is overflow parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4283.507s">Putting</a>  them further away from the school further away from that parking area That's what they're concerned about their safety is having their child and parents or grandparents walk now that extra area so I understand you know we have some You know allegiance to our bike riders, but that's not that it's not this isn't a <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4305.738s">for</a>  or against them. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4306.599s">This</a>  is something that just to look forward to a dialogue that making sure that like Councilor Caraviello said is getting those neighbors because we're now a community of transparency and making sure that everybody knows what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4320.837s">I</a>  think that's one of the things that <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4323.0s">The</a>  feedback I did get back was that the communication was really about taking of the land, but really not defined of taking of parking spots or having the input of those residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4333.951s">And</a>  I think that is a huge piece that has to be sent in that motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4339.377s">So</a>  thank you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4340.859s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4342.02s">Councilor</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4343.101s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4345.657s">I</a>  think I started my remarks saying I agree that we need to make sure that community input is what it needs to be and that everyone has a chance to get notified and have their voice on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4354.125s">I</a>  just also want to make sure that we don't, in the process of doing that, use rhetoric that may not be entirely accurate about bike lanes, that may injure or bias <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4366.95s">The</a>  people viewing to think that one part of this project is less important than the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4370.914s">I</a>  think we're balancing needs, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4372.516s">We're</a>  talking about balancing the need for on-street parking and the need for bike safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4375.679s">And</a>  then this third need, which is what are the requirements of the project? <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4379.464s">Or</a>  what are the requirements of the funding? <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4381.546s">And</a>  I just think we need to be careful with the words that we use. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4387.032s">I</a>  mean, to say that this bike lane goes to nowhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4390.39s">It's</a>  not exactly accurate to its purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4392.533s">So</a>  that's that's the reason that I brought it forward again. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4394.535s">I'm</a>  not biking up the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4395.556s">I'm</a>  driving. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4396.237s">So,</a>  you know, I have it's not coming from my personal experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4400.942s">But,</a>  you know, that's where I'm coming from on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4404.285s">And</a>  I also think we just need to make sure that we don't let people think. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4409.931s">You</a>  know if we want this project to go forward we need to make sure that we're being completely open that I think as admitted here. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4414.952s">We</a>  need to look at the options and maybe keeping on street parking in some cases won't be an option if we want to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4420.073s">And</a>  I don't think we want through the idea of saying we want to compromise and come together on this which I don't think is a bad thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4425.855s">I</a>  just don't want to think that we can also say that everyone's going to get everything they want at the end of the day because that's not really what we're in the business here. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4432.704s">It's</a>  it's we can't keep all the parking and do the bike lane and so maybe there's a solution here. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4437.106s">Maybe</a>  there's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4437.727s">And</a>  I think we need to be open about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4439.147s">And</a>  I also think we need to be open about the timeline that we're on which is you know we have some time here. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4444.15s">I</a>  think this is a better time to bring it up in three months from now. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4446.351s">And</a>  I completely agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4447.992s">But</a>  you know we do have a timeline to keep for land takings and all of this to go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4453.895s">So</a>  I just want to make sure that while we're respecting that and respecting what our reality of our options are here that we don't <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4459.152s">let</a>  people think that they're going to get something that they're not going to get out of it as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4462.495s">I</a>  think we need to be realistic about what this final, what the end game here, what the solution might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4468.682s">And</a>  that's where I'm coming from on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4471.464s">And</a>  I think that's our job.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4475.368s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4476.369s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4477.358s">I</a>  think we've beaten the horse to death, Mr. President, on this one.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4480.859s">I</a>  would agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4483.979s">Everyone</a>  has brought in some very valid points. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4486.58s">And</a>  we do have a resident that would like to speak on this, or maybe a few residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4491.401s">So</a>  if we could please have your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Jean Nuzzo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4493.721s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4494.161s">Jean</a>  Nuzzo, 35 Parrish Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4498.322s">Definitely,</a>  if you've ever spent any time in West Medford on High Street in that area, while there's not a significant high number <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4507.626s">of</a>  bicyclists. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4509.067s">There</a>  are many, and they travel that road faithfully, and it is a dangerous area for them to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4517.376s">One</a>  of the things that we do in the industry that you may want to consider is a mock-up... The cycling industry? <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4524.562s">No,</a>  in the construction industry.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4526.684s">I</a>  do not cycle.</p>

    <p>[Jean Nuzzo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4529.666s">Although,</a>  you know, in my younger days. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4532.168s">One</a>  of the things we do do is we mock up and we mark out space, especially in these incremental changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4538.874s">There</a>  are organizations like Team Better Block, I think they're called, that will come in and chalk mark the area in advance so that the residents and the community can see what the impact is that you're going to affect. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4553.986s">for</a>  a change. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4555.267s">It's</a>  not a lot of money, it's not a lasting change, but it allows people to see that change and then start to provide meaningful feedback because most people cannot look at a drawing <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4568.038s">and</a>  truly conceptualize what the impact of that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4571.28s">And</a>  I think we saw that down in South Medford across from the Tufts Pool, where we invested significant money to make a change to the flow of traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4581.969s">And</a>  it's been disastrous for the neighborhood because it put all the traffic down the side street. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4586.912s">And</a>  while the Brooks School has a hawk signal that flashes, the Columbus School does not. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4594.738s">and</a>  they get a significant amount of traffic and cars flow very fastly there as do the Roberts and the McGlynn so I think holistically we have a problem with people traveling excessively fast through our city and to give attention to one school <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4611.967s">and</a>  not mention all the others is really not equitable. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4615.512s">That's</a>  my first thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4617.395s">And</a>  I would encourage you to look at that opportunity, to mark up those streets and avoid the consequence that we are seeing over on Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4627.249s">The</a>  other point that <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4629.311s">gives</a>  me grave concern is that we are talking about eminent domain taking of private land for public safety and usage for bike paths and sidewalks and safe schools, which are all safe walking to school, which are all important. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4646.865s">But</a>  at the end of the day, it's an eminent domain taking of public land. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4651.366s">And</a>  that is a very slippery slope. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4653.847s">So</a>  I would ask you, today it's this area, three months from now it may be another. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4659.228s">Our</a>  highest level for public safety is the site formerly known as the Lawrence Memorial Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4665.309s">Are</a>  you ready to take that by eminent domain? <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4668.21s">It</a>  is a very slippery slope. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4670.07s">So</a>  what I would urge you to do is look at maybe marking up the space and seeing what the implications are before you open that Pandora's box. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4677.873s">And</a>  I thank you for your time.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4679.413s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4682.214s">Please</a>  have your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Miguel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4683.635s">Hi,</a>  my name is Melissa Miguel and I live on Bowen Ave and in full disclosure I just came here tonight to listen, wanted to see the new council, see how things are going. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4691.437s">What</a>  I'm hearing tonight with this bike lane is alarming to me and it's what I've been a resident of Medford for 17 years and what Medford lacks is planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4700.203s">We</a>  do not have a street and sidewalk reconstruction plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4703.445s">We</a>  just do something because the state is giving us money. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4705.907s">Let's</a>  do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4707.108s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4707.668s">How</a>  do you get to this three lane, this three block bike lane in front of the Brooks? <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4711.911s">Do</a>  we have a bicycle network plan that has identified slow, low volume? <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4717.255s">low-speed</a>  streets for these cyclists to get there, or we're just going to say, oh, on these three blocks in front of the Brooks School, you can get safely. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4722.917s">But</a>  how the hell you get there, you're on your own. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4726.158s">I</a>  ask this council to step back and look at the city as a whole and start making five-year plans for things like bike lanes. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4734.36s">I'm</a>  not saying I'm against the bike lane, but to throw, use that money from the state to do a bike network plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4739.922s">The</a>  city of Cambridge has one.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4743.845s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Morell.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4746.126s">As</a>  I understand, we do have a bike network plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4749.767s">I</a>  don't know how old it is, but I have seen it. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4751.967s">There</a>  is a bike network plan that exists.</p>

    <p>[Miguel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4753.888s">So</a>  we're going to connect those three blocks to the bike network plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4757.048s">And</a>  I'm not here to criticize, and I'm not here to compliment. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4759.369s">I'm</a>  just here to say we need to take a step back. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4762.61s">I</a>  live on Bowen Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4763.51s">If</a>  you drive down my street, we have the Grand Canyon in front of everybody's driveway on our street. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4767.971s">And</a>  they come, and they fill it with cold patch, and that lasts about two days, and it goes away. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4772.888s">Okay,</a>  I asked the city, I called the city engineer, can you tell me where the Chapter 90 funding is being spent? <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4778.412s">Can</a>  you tell me the last time Bowen Air was paved? <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4780.673s">Nobody</a>  has any idea, not a clue. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4784.115s">So</a>  I just ask that when you're spending this money, you think about doing long-term planning and not plopping a three, and now what if the state doesn't give us any more money, we have no more money, and like you said, you have somebody now speeding down High Street because for three blocks they felt safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4799.355s">Why</a>  don't you tell the bikes to get off of High Street and maybe take themselves down a street that's low volume and low speed, then come up the side street and make a safe crossing across High Street to get to the Brooks School, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4813.526s">I</a>  don't know what those low volume, but from what everybody's saying right here, High Street is dangerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4818.349s">So</a>  why are we encouraging cyclists to go down High Street? <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4822.833s">Good</a>  point. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4823.782s">Okay,</a>  so I ask that we take a step back, tell the state this year, thank you for your money, but we'd like to use that for planning purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4831.286s">And</a>  I've lived here for 17 years, I have never spoken at a city council meeting, but for 17 years, I had high hopes for the new people on this council, and the new woman in the big office, and I have not seen any change in six weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4844.214s">Full</a>  disclosure, I was on the transition committee, I want to see Medford change for the positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4849.257s">If</a>  that means bike lanes, sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4851.778s">But</a>  we can't even pave a street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4854.199s">Then</a>  the cyclists are going to be complaining that they're cycling down potholes and rutted streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4859.821s">We</a>  need to take a step back and start planning the future of this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4865.023s">And</a>  I ask that we do a five-year infrastructure plan for our drainage, our sewer, our water. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4870.084s">A</a>  five-year plan for our streets and sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4873.786s">And</a>  instead of just taking money from the state to put down three blocks of bike lane, I think it's a waste. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4879.408s">And</a>  that's just my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4881.313s">Thank</a>  you for listening to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4882.234s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4882.914s">Thank</a>  you for coming out tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4883.875s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4884.095s">Appreciate</a>  it.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4888.958s">Yeah,</a>  I could go. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4891.179s">I</a>  don't want to make this a debate about bikes, which it seems it has turned into, but just a <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4895.75s">Many</a>  people who cycle and ride their bike to work are also own cars, drive cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4901.374s">When</a>  they're biking, they're not in their car. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4903.196s">They're</a>  not damaging the roads the same way a car does. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4905.637s">They're</a>  not adding to congestion the same way a car does. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4908.72s">Bikes</a>  aren't perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4909.6s">None</a>  of this is perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4910.561s">We're</a>  retrofitting old infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4912.883s">But</a>  it's a bigger issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4917.767s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4918.267s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4920.092s">Councilor</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4921.413s">Yeah,</a>  just a couple of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4923.133s">I</a>  would love to spend this money on long-term planning, but we're not allowed to by the purposes of the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4927.955s">It's</a>  been in for a few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4929.376s">The</a>  Roberts also applied, but they were not accepted, I think, mainly because of the danger. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4934.438s">I</a>  mean, it's a dangerous area by the Roberts as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4936.959s">I</a>  think there were specifics to the Roberts case, not to the proposal, but to the area around there as to why it wasn't accepted. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4943.022s">You'd</a>  have to ask the people who didn't accept it. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4945.743s">But</a>  I completely agree with you we need long term planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4949.546s">My</a>  understanding is that several of the plans that you mentioned that the mayor's office and the chief of staff are working on trying to get to a street and sidewalk plan and that that's at least my understanding is that they're working to get to that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4965.339s">But</a>  they would need to update you on that and that is their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4969.642s">But</a>  yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4971.618s">In</a>  terms of this specific money and in terms of the applications for the other schools, other schools applied, it actually came from the schools with parents working with the administration of the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4983.503s">And</a>  yeah, this money can't be spent on anything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4987.585s">So</a>  while I'd love to spend it on thinking bigger, this is the opportunity we have before us and I think we need to take it to make a street safer.</p>

    <p>[Miguel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4996.728s">And</a>  I just want to say that I agree with Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4998.849s">We</a>  need to tell the state thank you, but no thank you at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=5001.849s">Because</a>  you're going to be encouraging cyclists to cycle on three streets that everybody has said is dangerous, and they only feel safe on three blocks. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=5009.412s">So</a>  I think at this time, we need to tell MassDOT thank you, but no thank you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=5012.312s">The</a>  project does a lot for pedestrian safety as well.</p>

    <p>[Miguel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=5015.073s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=5015.893s">You're</a>  entitled to your opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=5016.754s">I'm</a>  entitled to mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=5017.354s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=5017.834s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=5144.725s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=5146.367s">As</a>  many of us are aware, there was a complete streets project that was started down at Tufts Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=5152.334s">And</a>  it doesn't look to me as though this project is finished, but it doesn't look to me as though there's much work going on down there either, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=5161.756s">The</a>  parking area has not been striped. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=5163.799s">There's</a>  no shrubbery or any type of ballast or anything like that that I believe were part of the plan that were going to be put in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=5170.208s">It</a>  looks like there's a problem with the gradient and pitch as well, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=5175.096s">It</a>  looks like in a rainstorm the. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=5178.053s">rain</a>  would puddle up quite a bit going down towards the Citizens Bank area of the parking lot over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=5184.218s">So</a>  I'm hoping that we can get an update from the city administration, including but not limited to the construction schedule, where we are in the process, what percentage of the project is complete at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=5197.248s">Ultimately,</a>  Mr. President, if you think about that little Tufts Square area, and you think about all the businesses that were there, it's a very historic area, very important to the heritage and history of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=5208.374s">I</a>  was just talking to a friend of mine just the other day on Golden Ave, Michael Price, who showed me a newspaper article of Dolly's Beauty Salon down right there in Tufts Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=5219.199s">And</a>  Dolly, his mother, was the youngest hair salon owner ever licensed <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=5226.596s">in</a>  the Commonwealth of Massachusetts at age 15. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=5229.157s">Mr.</a>  President, she was a business owner at age 15 right there in Tufts Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=5232.898s">So</a>  it's my hope that we can remember the good things of that square and the good businesses and the good legacies that were left behind by honoring them a little bit more with the completion of this construction project, Mr. President, and also when the time is right <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=5247.235s">Hopefully</a>  maybe a history board or a story board down there, but at this point in time I would just like to ask for an update from the administration as to what's going on with the tough square project where we are and When it's going to be complete and what the construction schedule looks like Thank You console night console beers I'd just like to amend this paper to ask the administration also if they have any data or information on the impact of the change in</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=5269.2s">intersection</a>  orientation on traffic, and also if they have any data or anecdotes on the impact of the Broadway bus lane on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=5279.643s">Repeat</a>  it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=5280.184s">If</a>  you could please repeat that to the clerk.</p>
