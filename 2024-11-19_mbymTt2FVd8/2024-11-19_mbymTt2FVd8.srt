[SPEAKER_00]: We have very many talented people in the city who will be able to contribute time artistic quality decorations to Some of the space that's going to be at this new library I think this is an item that you really have to think about Before you write out a check for a quarter of a million dollars.

00:35:35,426 --> 00:35:45,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Redefine Strength and Fitness is going to be a small personal training and group fitness studio, and people like to do that early, so that's why we asked for the extension to 5 a.m.

407
00:36:33,966 --> 00:36:34,806

408

[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone in opposition of the petition, please come forward.

410
00:36:45,451 --> 00:36:46,211

00:36:48,226 --> 00:36:51,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Hearing and seeing none, I declare this portion of the hearing closed.

412
00:36:55,931 --> 00:36:57,392
[SPEAKER_04]: I would ask you to please come forward at this point.

413
00:37:00,654 --> 00:37:01,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, first time.

414
00:37:01,694 --> 00:37:02,815
[SPEAKER_04]: No worries, no worries.

415
00:37:03,035 --> 00:37:03,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli.

416
00:37:04,696 --> 00:37:06,017
[SPEAKER_14]: If you could just give us the location.

417
00:37:07,518 --> 00:37:10,040
[SPEAKER_14]: Where is the location?

418
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,581
[SPEAKER_05]: 215 B Salem Street.

419
00:37:11,681 --> 00:37:14,763
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's, I'm,

420
00:37:15,587 --> 00:37:20,793
[SPEAKER_05]: On the other side of 93, there's Brookline Bank, then used to be Stove King and the Vape Depot.

421
00:37:21,493 --> 00:37:23,476
[SPEAKER_05]: The Vape Depot closed and we're moving in.

422
00:37:25,578 --> 00:37:32,105
[SPEAKER_14]: And what type of exercises and fitness programs do you look like you'll be?

423
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:36,389
[SPEAKER_05]: I would describe it broadly as strength training, fitness training.

424
00:37:37,217 --> 00:37:46,683
[SPEAKER_08]: group exercise classes where you'll do some like cardio movements, like jumping jacks and then battle ropes and riding the bike.

425
00:37:47,544 --> 00:37:49,846
[SPEAKER_14]: And that would be inside the facility, nothing outside?

426
00:37:50,206 --> 00:37:50,466
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

427
00:37:50,706 --> 00:37:52,427
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, all inside.

428
00:37:52,487 --> 00:37:53,688
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no space outside.

429
00:37:53,848 --> 00:37:56,510
[SPEAKER_14]: That's too bad, because I like space when I work out.

430
00:37:59,072 --> 00:37:59,512
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

431
00:37:59,892 --> 00:38:01,313
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll have lots of natural light.

432
00:38:01,413 --> 00:38:01,954
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be there.

433
00:38:02,094 --> 00:38:03,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Feel like outside.

434
00:38:05,136 --> 00:38:06,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

435
00:38:07,643 --> 00:38:08,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Morell.

436
00:38:09,344 --> 00:38:09,964
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

437
00:38:10,004 --> 00:38:14,265
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just curious if there might be loud music or any sound to be expected during this time.

438
00:38:14,905 --> 00:38:17,486
[SPEAKER_05]: There will be music, but not loud music.

439
00:38:17,726 --> 00:38:19,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Currently, the space is under construction.

440
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:23,688
[SPEAKER_05]: The roof and the walls, all the exterior walls are being insulated.

441
00:38:24,448 --> 00:38:26,248
[SPEAKER_05]: And I kind of don't like loud music.

442
00:38:27,049 --> 00:38:30,450
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we're not going to be wearing microphones to talk over the music.

443
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:31,570
[SPEAKER_08]: So it'll be sort of like

444
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,061
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll give instructions.

445
00:38:33,241 --> 00:38:34,281
[SPEAKER_08]: The music will be down.

446
00:38:34,301 --> 00:38:38,783
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll probably turn it up a little just to give a little bit of energy for people working out.

447
00:38:38,843 --> 00:38:40,124
[SPEAKER_08]: But it won't be all the time.

448
00:38:40,364 --> 00:38:43,765
[SPEAKER_08]: And as Mike said, it's all being re-insulated and redone.

449
00:38:43,866 --> 00:38:46,267
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's also like thick concrete walls as well.

450
00:38:46,767 --> 00:38:46,847
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

451
00:38:47,327 --> 00:38:47,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

452
00:38:49,048 --> 00:38:49,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Morell.

453
00:38:50,629 --> 00:38:51,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

454
00:38:51,788 --> 00:38:53,028
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

455
00:38:53,088 --> 00:38:56,949
[SPEAKER_12]: It's always good to see the vape depot being replaced by a gym, right?

456
00:38:57,029 --> 00:39:00,750
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I think it shows we're coming full circle down there on Salem Street when it comes to this issue.

457
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:03,510
[SPEAKER_12]: I certainly don't have a problem with the petition.

458
00:39:04,171 --> 00:39:10,752
[SPEAKER_12]: However, where it's a 5 o'clock in the morning application, it does raise some concerns to the quality of life of the residents in the neighborhood.

459
00:39:11,632 --> 00:39:16,373
[SPEAKER_12]: So Mr. President, I certainly have no problem voting in favor of this this evening provided that

460
00:39:17,067 --> 00:39:21,050
[SPEAKER_12]: We amend the application that the permit would go with the business and not the address.

461
00:39:21,671 --> 00:39:30,157
[SPEAKER_12]: And that we put a 90 and a 180 day review on the special permit, Mr. President, to be sure that any issues in the neighborhood can be addressed in a timely fashion.

462
00:39:30,678 --> 00:39:38,504
[SPEAKER_12]: As operations progress and business gets busier and you got half of the city of Medford in there beating down your door wanting to become members at your gym.

463
00:39:39,024 --> 00:39:42,126
[SPEAKER_12]: We just want to make sure that the quality of life issues in the neighborhood are protected.

464
00:39:43,087 --> 00:39:50,691
[SPEAKER_12]: This is common practice, we do this quite a bit where we put a 90 day review or a 180 day review on a special permit application for extended hours.

465
00:39:50,811 --> 00:40:00,477
[SPEAKER_12]: And we also make sure that it goes with your business name as opposed to the address so that if you vacate and another entity comes in, that those extended hours aren't grandfathered in.

466
00:40:00,537 --> 00:40:03,138
[SPEAKER_12]: So just a little explanation as to what the motions were that were made.

467
00:40:03,499 --> 00:40:05,800
[SPEAKER_12]: I certainly wish you all the best of luck and don't have any opposition.

468
00:40:06,593 --> 00:40:09,214
[SPEAKER_12]: To them putting in their personal fitness studio down there.

469
00:40:09,254 --> 00:40:10,094
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President.

470
00:40:10,134 --> 00:40:14,375
[SPEAKER_12]: However, we have to protect the interest of the neighborhood as well And I think that this is a good compromise.

471
00:40:14,935 --> 00:40:15,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you console night.

472
00:40:15,815 --> 00:40:29,697
[SPEAKER_14]: I offer them in Thank You console night console skypelly I Yield I my fellow Councilor mentioned what I wanted to propose.

473
00:40:29,797 --> 00:40:30,057
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

474
00:40:30,077 --> 00:40:30,297
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

475
00:40:30,557 --> 00:40:33,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you Any other questions from the council?

476
00:40:34,182 --> 00:40:49,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Knight, as amended by Councilor Knight, the amendment would be that the permit goes with the business and that there will be a review after 90 and 180 days.

477
00:40:51,171 --> 00:40:54,553
[SPEAKER_04]: On that motion, Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.

478
00:41:00,015 --> 00:41:00,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Bears?

479
00:41:00,876 --> 00:41:01,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

480
00:41:01,596 --> 00:41:02,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Carriano?

481
00:41:02,617 --> 00:41:02,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

482
00:41:09,269 --> 00:41:10,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

483
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:11,631
[SPEAKER_04]: 70 affirmative, zero negative.

484
00:41:12,111 --> 00:41:12,912
[SPEAKER_04]: The motion passes.

485
00:41:13,252 --> 00:41:14,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Good luck and congratulations.

486
00:41:15,273 --> 00:41:15,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

487
00:41:16,374 --> 00:41:18,395
[SPEAKER_05]: So should we come back in 90 days?

488
00:41:20,297 --> 00:41:26,561
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, okay.

489
00:41:27,702 --> 00:41:28,222
Thank you.

490
00:41:28,482 --> 00:41:28,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

491
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:47,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Motions, orders, and resolutions 20-068 offered by Councilor Morell be it resolved that the city administration provide an update on a storefront improvement program to support businesses in improving the curb appeal of our squares.

492
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:53,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Morell.

493
00:41:53,565 --> 00:41:54,466
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

494
00:41:54,906 --> 00:42:05,553
[SPEAKER_11]: So recently had a local business owner reach out and say that they had reached out to the city about a storefront improvement program, and they were told that we no longer run the program or we no longer issue funds.

495
00:42:05,973 --> 00:42:11,297
[SPEAKER_11]: So these are local programs that provide financial support to businesses looking to improve or update their public facing.

496
00:42:11,777 --> 00:42:29,810
[SPEAKER_11]: Facades I did reach out to Ashley Williams the CDBG administrator for the city to see if we could find out more She said in her time with the city three and a half years The program hasn't been run and it was kind of hard-pressed to find the last time this program has been run I actually did find reference to it in a job posting from 2019.

497
00:42:30,371 --> 00:42:38,396
[SPEAKER_11]: So it seems there was previous interest in this but several our neighboring communities run these type of programs where they either offer a 0% deferred payment loan or a

498
00:42:39,517 --> 00:42:40,678
[SPEAKER_11]: or matching grant funds.

499
00:42:40,938 --> 00:42:42,459
[SPEAKER_11]: And a lot of times these funds are small.

500
00:42:43,299 --> 00:42:45,260
[SPEAKER_11]: In many communities, they're capped around $2,000.

501
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:53,925
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think with many of our local businesses operating on razor-thin margins, this program with small amounts of funds would actually make all the difference.

502
00:42:54,825 --> 00:42:57,066
[SPEAKER_11]: So these programs are funded a number of different ways.

503
00:42:57,287 --> 00:43:05,431
[SPEAKER_11]: So depending if it is a spot basis for a business where decay or blight can be identified, CDBG would possibly fund that.

504
00:43:05,901 --> 00:43:09,762
[SPEAKER_11]: Same thing with businesses being in a certain census track, which we might not qualify for.

505
00:43:10,623 --> 00:43:19,166
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think there's also the option where, with the business district parking funds that, as we were updated, I believe, have been found, for lack of a better word.

506
00:43:19,646 --> 00:43:30,350
[SPEAKER_11]: Perhaps this is a way where we can directly fund businesses or support businesses to increase that curb appeal and beautification that we talk about so often in this city.

507
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:31,671
[SPEAKER_11]: In this chamber.

508
00:43:32,352 --> 00:43:51,914
[SPEAKER_11]: So really all I'm asking for is the city to provide an update on the sass of the program because that's Some hard to find and just to understand the level of interest so that as businesses do look for this program because this program does exist in Cambridge and blue burn and Worcester and still win in a number of surrounding communities as businesses come into Medford or they've been here for a long time and they're looking for this kind of support.

509
00:43:52,348 --> 00:43:54,830
[SPEAKER_11]: We're able to give them an answer, point them in the right direction.

510
00:43:55,631 --> 00:44:04,337
[SPEAKER_11]: And also to that end, there is the public meeting on March 11th for the CDBG five-year consolidated plan and one-year annual action plan where they are seeking public input.

511
00:44:04,397 --> 00:44:13,725
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think having this update from the city from the status or interest in a program like this would be timely, understanding that public meeting is coming up on the 11th.

512
00:44:14,125 --> 00:44:15,446
[SPEAKER_04]: So, thank you.

513
00:44:15,746 --> 00:44:16,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Morell.

514
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:21,211
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of Councilor Morell, seconded by Councilor Knight.

515
00:44:21,552 --> 00:44:22,192
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

516
00:44:22,212 --> 00:44:22,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

517
00:44:22,912 --> 00:44:23,452
[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed?

518
00:44:23,472 --> 00:44:24,173
[SPEAKER_04]: The motion passes.

519
00:44:26,854 --> 00:44:38,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Petitions, presentations, and similar papers, 20-069, petition by Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street, Medford, Massachusetts, 02155, to discuss zoning loopholes being exploited by flippers.

520
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,161
[SPEAKER_04]: The clerk has notified me that

521
00:44:43,890 --> 00:45:10,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Miss Rodriguez is sick, and she could not make it tonight, so on the motion of console night to table this seconded by On the motion of console console marks to table the matter seconded by By constant car viola all those in favor all those opposed the please mark console night is opposed The paper has been tabled

522
00:45:15,728 --> 00:45:20,895
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of Council Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli to take papers in the hands of the clerk.

523
00:45:21,476 --> 00:45:22,177
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

524
00:45:22,757 --> 00:45:23,378
[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed?

525
00:45:23,398 --> 00:45:24,199
[SPEAKER_04]: The motion passes.

526
00:45:24,259 --> 00:45:30,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Offered by Councilor Marks, be it resolved that the safe routes project scheduled for High Street be discussed.

527
00:45:34,597 --> 00:45:35,258
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Marks.

528
00:45:35,978 --> 00:45:36,979
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

529
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:41,203
[SPEAKER_13]: The Medford City Council had Committee of the Whole last week.

530
00:45:41,684 --> 00:45:42,925
[SPEAKER_13]: We met with the Mass.

531
00:45:42,945 --> 00:45:58,239
[SPEAKER_13]: Department of Transportation, as well as City Engineer, and they gave us an update on the Safe Routes to School project, which the Brooks School sought funding from the state back some

532
00:45:59,252 --> 00:46:14,143
[SPEAKER_13]: two or three years I think now, and they just received $1 million for upgrades for safe routes along High Street, which includes Hastings Lane, Mystic Street, and Walcott Street.

533
00:46:14,943 --> 00:46:23,169
[SPEAKER_13]: And some of the updates they're looking about curb extensions, bump outs, pedestrian lights in that particular area.

534
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:26,492
[SPEAKER_13]: As part of this project, we were told by

535
00:46:27,238 --> 00:46:33,643
[SPEAKER_13]: Mass Department of Transportation, that there will also be some land takings in that particular area.

536
00:46:34,463 --> 00:46:40,307
[SPEAKER_13]: And the City of Medford is now reaching out to many of the homeowners along High Street.

537
00:46:41,008 --> 00:46:51,175
[SPEAKER_13]: In addition, Mr. President, there is also going to be a bike lane that will be put on the southbound side of High Street.

538
00:46:52,424 --> 00:46:58,227
[SPEAKER_13]: And the bike lane goes from Auburn Street all the way up to Woburn Street.

539
00:46:59,248 --> 00:47:03,850
[SPEAKER_13]: And it starts and ends in that particular area.

540
00:47:05,711 --> 00:47:12,315
[SPEAKER_13]: On the other side of the street, they will have a lane that could be used, I guess, for both bikes and cars mutually.

541
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:24,982
[SPEAKER_13]: Just recently, Mr. President, the Traffic Commission also held a meeting because approval would be required by the Traffic Commission to eliminate some of the spots.

542
00:47:25,662 --> 00:47:40,226
[SPEAKER_13]: We were told at last week's meeting, last Wednesday, that they numbered out the spots to be 60 on-street parking spots from Auburn Street all the way up to Hastings Lane.

543
00:47:41,067 --> 00:47:41,747
[SPEAKER_13]: And of the 60,

544
00:47:43,467 --> 00:47:50,509
[SPEAKER_13]: 19, according to their numbers, were going to be eliminated on the southbound side.

545
00:47:51,170 --> 00:48:01,773
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, over the last week, Mr. President, I, like many members behind this reel, have received a number of phone calls, residents that did attend the 2 p.m.

546
00:48:02,153 --> 00:48:05,054
[SPEAKER_13]: Traffic Commission meeting and

547
00:48:06,624 --> 00:48:08,265
[SPEAKER_13]: They weren't quite sure.

548
00:48:08,345 --> 00:48:14,310
[SPEAKER_13]: They thought they were going there to listen to a presentation about this new Safe Routes project.

549
00:48:15,090 --> 00:48:29,121
[SPEAKER_13]: And unbeknownst to them, there was an actual vote taken by the Traffic Commission to eliminate spots in front of people's homes that have been there for four, five, six decades, Mr. President.

550
00:48:29,501 --> 00:48:31,043
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think anyone behind this reel

551
00:48:31,763 --> 00:48:35,244
[SPEAKER_13]: is against safe routes, and I think I could speak for my colleagues.

552
00:48:35,684 --> 00:48:36,864
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we all welcome that.

553
00:48:37,204 --> 00:48:38,805
[SPEAKER_13]: We all welcome state funding.

554
00:48:39,205 --> 00:48:42,246
[SPEAKER_13]: Anytime you can get additional funding, that's great, Mr. President.

555
00:48:42,706 --> 00:48:50,488
[SPEAKER_13]: But I do have concerns, Mr. President, that this project may not move forward if we're not able to reach a compromise.

556
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:55,662
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think the best way to do it is at this point, where it's still in the early stages.

557
00:48:56,322 --> 00:49:11,429
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm formally requesting tonight that we ask our city engineer to go back to the Department of Transportation regarding the southbound bike lane that only is about two city, three city blocks.

558
00:49:12,129 --> 00:49:17,712
[SPEAKER_13]: That they revisit the elimination, Mr. President, of those spots.

559
00:49:18,172 --> 00:49:22,913
[SPEAKER_13]: to accommodate a five foot bike lane that leads to nowhere.

560
00:49:23,894 --> 00:49:26,254
[SPEAKER_13]: It ends, it starts, it ends.

561
00:49:26,734 --> 00:49:28,455
[SPEAKER_13]: And like I said, three city blocks.

562
00:49:29,275 --> 00:49:39,158
[SPEAKER_13]: And we were told that the Department of Transportation will only entertain projects and only fund projects if it includes bike lanes.

563
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:46,659
[SPEAKER_13]: But in my opinion, Mr. President, it makes no sense to have a bike lane that doesn't continue on.

564
00:49:47,479 --> 00:49:56,182
[SPEAKER_13]: I asked a question that night, well, if it stops all the way up at Hastings Lane, where does the bike go after that?

565
00:49:56,642 --> 00:49:59,143
[SPEAKER_13]: And they said the bike will continue to ride on the street.

566
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:10,451
[SPEAKER_13]: Because under the laws of Massachusetts, bikes and cars are allowed to have equal access to the street.

567
00:50:12,192 --> 00:50:14,613
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think we can head this off, Mr. President.

568
00:50:15,013 --> 00:50:26,875
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't want to be at the last minute attending to neighborhood concerns when they're going to be asking for a vote of this council to improve land takings, which will make the project even go further down.

569
00:50:27,235 --> 00:50:34,897
[SPEAKER_13]: So I would ask at this point that we intervene, we send a letter to our city engineer, let him know that we feel more comfortable.

570
00:50:36,118 --> 00:50:51,171
[SPEAKER_13]: that the project, while it's in the early stages, be revisited to add those 19 spots that we're going to lose and come out with another solution that doesn't impact parking, Mr. President.

571
00:50:51,592 --> 00:50:57,097
[SPEAKER_13]: Many of the residents were told, well, if you live on a high street and they're removing that spot, just park across the street.

572
00:50:57,988 --> 00:51:07,329
[SPEAKER_13]: And one of the residents that called me said, well, my 80-year-old mother really shouldn't be crossing a very busy street that you're already saying this concerns.

573
00:51:08,248 --> 00:51:18,230
[SPEAKER_13]: and having her walk another 300 yards to maybe get up to the pedestrian light to cross over to get to her house, where we've had this spot in front of my house for five decades.

574
00:51:19,371 --> 00:51:21,311
[SPEAKER_13]: So I can see where they're coming from, Mr. President.

575
00:51:21,691 --> 00:51:36,635
[SPEAKER_13]: Other residents on Mystic Street that contacted me were concerned that by eliminating these particular spots, especially next to the Brooks School, that you're just going to take people that are regularly parking on High Street and push them into the secondary roads.

576
00:51:37,375 --> 00:51:43,399
[SPEAKER_13]: which I think is a concern for residents already in a busy area, Mr. President.

577
00:51:43,439 --> 00:52:00,370
[SPEAKER_13]: So I would ask that in the form of a motion that we send it to the city engineer and have him contact DOT regarding the bike lane and other options available so we can continue to have the 60 spots that residents count on right now, Mr. President.

578
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:14,036
[SPEAKER_13]: in a very cramped area, not just because of the school, because of the public transportation in the West Method area, because it's right out of the business district in West Method, and that area is very congested as is.

579
00:52:14,557 --> 00:52:15,437
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

580
00:52:15,497 --> 00:52:16,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

581
00:52:16,458 --> 00:52:19,999
[SPEAKER_04]: There are a number of Councilors that want to speak on this.

582
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:24,962
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the motion of Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

583
00:52:26,983 --> 00:52:27,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

584
00:52:28,015 --> 00:52:31,916
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President, thank you very much, and I couldn't put it any better than Councilor Marks.

585
00:52:32,436 --> 00:52:35,957
[SPEAKER_12]: Ultimately, we have residents that live in homes that are upwards of $600,000 to $700,000.

586
00:52:35,997 --> 00:52:39,438
[SPEAKER_12]: They pay property taxes in upwards of $7,000 to $8,000 a year, have vehicles, pay excise tax.

587
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:47,824
[SPEAKER_12]: God forbid they want to have company over the house and you can't park in front of your own house.

588
00:52:48,084 --> 00:52:50,067
[SPEAKER_12]: God forbid you have a landscaper or work being done.

589
00:52:50,127 --> 00:52:50,787
[SPEAKER_12]: Where are they going to park?

590
00:52:50,888 --> 00:52:52,109
[SPEAKER_12]: Where are they going to go, Mr. President?

591
00:52:53,150 --> 00:53:03,503
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I don't see the need for a path to nowhere, especially when we just spent how many millions of dollars extending a community path one block

592
00:53:05,051 --> 00:53:18,280
[SPEAKER_12]: away at Memorial Park with crosswalk right at Auburn Street, crosswalk right at Winthrop Street that runs actually all the way from Medford Square all the way to the Brooks School, Mr. President.

593
00:53:18,301 --> 00:53:22,023
[SPEAKER_12]: So we actually have a bike path, a community path that's in place now that's been constructed.

594
00:53:22,323 --> 00:53:24,885
[SPEAKER_12]: We all took pictures next to the sign when they did the ribbon cutting.

595
00:53:25,205 --> 00:53:25,666
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's there.

596
00:53:26,126 --> 00:53:26,446
[SPEAKER_12]: It's there.

597
00:53:26,466 --> 00:53:27,827
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's underutilized, Mr. President.

598
00:53:28,208 --> 00:53:29,709
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think that that's a good compromise.

599
00:53:29,749 --> 00:53:32,851
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, ultimately, we have a community path that's one block away.

600
00:53:33,351 --> 00:53:39,734
[SPEAKER_12]: We have residents in this community that have invested their life savings to purchase these homes, and their quality of life is going to be impacted by it.

601
00:53:40,515 --> 00:53:47,338
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, we talk about zoning and ordinances and taking away inner court parking, Mr. President, inner court parking.

602
00:53:47,378 --> 00:53:55,922
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, you're not allowed to park inside the front, the inner court of your house, but they'll come down and they'll put a bike lane right in front of your house, and then you won't have any place to put your car.

603
00:53:56,302 --> 00:53:57,022
[SPEAKER_12]: So where's it going to go?

604
00:53:57,062 --> 00:53:58,023
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to go to Mystic Avenue.

605
00:53:58,143 --> 00:53:59,023
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to go to Mystic Street.

606
00:53:59,363 --> 00:54:00,344
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to go to Auburn Street.

607
00:54:00,724 --> 00:54:01,865
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to go to Piedmont Street.

608
00:54:01,945 --> 00:54:02,445
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to go to...

609
00:54:03,246 --> 00:54:08,473
[SPEAKER_12]: All the ancillary secondary roads that people can't find a place to park their car, they're going to put them in the neighborhoods.

610
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:15,102
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, just last Wednesday, I had the opportunity to go to the Brooks School for a wonderful winter concert, Mr. President.

611
00:54:15,343 --> 00:54:18,087
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think I'm confident in saying that my kids are never going to win a Grammy.

612
00:54:19,108 --> 00:54:27,778
[SPEAKER_12]: But when I got there, I had to park my car, and it was, there's 100 kids in the Brooks School's kindergarten class this year, and it was the kindergarten concert.

613
00:54:28,058 --> 00:54:30,140
[SPEAKER_12]: So there were a number of families that were there, 100 families.

614
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:33,584
[SPEAKER_12]: So you can imagine what the parking was like at the Brooks School during a regular school day, Mr. President.

615
00:54:34,005 --> 00:54:37,769
[SPEAKER_12]: I had to park almost in front of Councilor Caraviello's house on Prescott Street.

616
00:54:39,268 --> 00:54:40,309
[SPEAKER_12]: to go to the concert.

617
00:54:40,469 --> 00:54:42,250
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's with the parking on High Street.

618
00:54:42,911 --> 00:54:48,955
[SPEAKER_12]: So as events happen in our schools, as our school population grows, those spots are going to become more and more valuable.

619
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:51,337
[SPEAKER_12]: So I can't agree more with Councilor Marks.

620
00:54:51,357 --> 00:54:59,563
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I think we need to take a look at this and figure out a solution that's a compromise that allows the residents to maintain their quality of life while also implementing the Safe Routes to School project.

621
00:55:00,544 --> 00:55:04,067
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, a path that starts here and ends there and doesn't go anywhere.

622
00:55:04,107 --> 00:55:05,768
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't see the benefit, Mr. President.

623
00:55:05,808 --> 00:55:06,248
[SPEAKER_12]: I really don't.

624
00:55:07,409 --> 00:55:08,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

625
00:55:10,572 --> 00:55:11,393
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli.

626
00:55:12,253 --> 00:55:12,974
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

627
00:55:12,994 --> 00:55:18,737
[SPEAKER_14]: I thank Councilor Marks for bringing this forward and Councilor Knight for adding his input.

628
00:55:18,757 --> 00:55:25,321
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that, not to be redundant, but there are some great safety initiatives in place with the safe routes.

629
00:55:25,882 --> 00:55:27,903
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I love the Woburn Street Island.

630
00:55:27,943 --> 00:55:31,986
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's something that's really needed, a crosswalk in that area.

631
00:55:32,406 --> 00:55:34,427
[SPEAKER_14]: And you'd hate to throw away

632
00:55:36,008 --> 00:55:39,789
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, a great plan for a few sticking points.

633
00:55:39,849 --> 00:55:55,974
[SPEAKER_14]: But I will tell you, the phone calls I did receive as well and emails are the same issues and concerns where you're talking about safety being the number one concern and you are, I had a phone call from an 80-year-old resident that had that same concern.

634
00:55:56,934 --> 00:55:59,055
[SPEAKER_14]: response saying that it's safe routes.

635
00:55:59,716 --> 00:56:07,100
[SPEAKER_14]: Now I have to park across the street if I want to park, and I have to cross one of the major throughways.

636
00:56:07,221 --> 00:56:10,383
[SPEAKER_14]: Like I said, I won't be redundant, but I support this 100%.

637
00:56:11,383 --> 00:56:21,269
[SPEAKER_14]: I think to revisit this is very important, and I think we need to really take a hard stop and to revisit this, so thank you.

638
00:56:21,529 --> 00:56:22,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

639
00:56:24,651 --> 00:56:25,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Bears.

640
00:56:25,885 --> 00:56:26,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

641
00:56:28,347 --> 00:56:33,031
[SPEAKER_07]: First, I want to acknowledge definitely that we need to make sure that we have the best community process possible.

642
00:56:33,091 --> 00:56:46,342
[SPEAKER_07]: And I want to acknowledge the city engineer and the traffic engineer's outreach to many houses and families in the area, both the folks who are having takings, the folks who have issues with walls, as we heard extensively last meeting.

643
00:56:47,548 --> 00:56:57,574
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think, absolutely, we need to make every possible action we can to accommodate people with disabilities, people with handicap parking, 80-year-olds who really need access to their home.

644
00:56:58,215 --> 00:56:59,275
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's a few things here.

645
00:56:59,315 --> 00:57:03,198
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the first thing to say is that this is 100% state and federal money.

646
00:57:03,558 --> 00:57:06,219
[SPEAKER_07]: This project doesn't use any city dollars.

647
00:57:06,239 --> 00:57:07,400
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just want to put that out there.

648
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:08,521
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not matching.

649
00:57:08,581 --> 00:57:09,301
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not additional.

650
00:57:09,341 --> 00:57:11,222
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a million dollars we won't otherwise have.

651
00:57:11,963 --> 00:57:14,705
[SPEAKER_07]: And no city money will be going towards it.

652
00:57:16,603 --> 00:57:30,115
[SPEAKER_07]: So a few things, one, the studies done by the traffic engineer and the city engineer showed that much of the parking on the south side of High Street does go underused most of the time.

653
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:32,277
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not to say there aren't cases and specifics.

654
00:57:33,472 --> 00:57:43,896
[SPEAKER_07]: kindergarten concerts and certain people who park in front of their houses of a certain age, but that the statistics showed that most of that parking was going underutilized or unutilized completely.

655
00:57:44,516 --> 00:57:48,258
[SPEAKER_07]: And then just this bike path to nowhere thing.

656
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:53,860
[SPEAKER_07]: You might not think I ride a bike, and I've never ridden a bike on High Street, but I have a lot of friends who do bike, and

657
00:57:54,923 --> 00:57:56,745
[SPEAKER_07]: That's actually the one place on High Street.

658
00:57:56,765 --> 00:58:04,532
[SPEAKER_07]: If I had to pick anywhere on High Street between the Arlington Rotary and the Winthrop Street Rotary to put a bike lane, it would be exactly where this bike lane is.

659
00:58:04,692 --> 00:58:10,538
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the highest slope uphill in a place where traffic coming across the hill is obstructed view.

660
00:58:10,598 --> 00:58:12,219
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't see people coming up the hill.

661
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:18,085
[SPEAKER_07]: And you need to separate out bike traffic and street traffic or else you're going to get in a situation where you have bike traffic.

662
00:58:18,565 --> 00:58:21,626
[SPEAKER_07]: slowing up to 10, five miles an hour.

663
00:58:21,686 --> 00:58:28,829
[SPEAKER_07]: You try huffing a bike all the way up the hill from West Medford Square to the top of the hill past Auburn Street, you're gonna be biking pretty slow.

664
00:58:28,969 --> 00:58:35,891
[SPEAKER_07]: And the point of this bike lane is to separate out the traffic at exactly the point at which the speed of the bikes and the speeds of the car traffic are gonna be at the most disparate.

665
00:58:36,411 --> 00:58:38,233
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not really a path to nowhere.

666
00:58:38,273 --> 00:58:45,741
[SPEAKER_07]: It's saying that if you're on share road shared lanes everywhere else, this is the one spot of the road where you actually want to separate out the traffic.

667
00:58:45,761 --> 00:58:47,002
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's just the bike.

668
00:58:47,743 --> 00:58:48,944
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the engineering behind it.

669
00:58:50,545 --> 00:58:52,768
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I just want to put out there, it's not really a path to nowhere.

670
00:58:52,788 --> 00:58:55,490
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually putting a bike lane in one of the spots where it's safest.

671
00:58:55,510 --> 00:58:56,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of information, Councilor Marks.

672
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:02,291
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

673
00:59:02,691 --> 00:59:12,815
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, the report that was done spoke about the number of spots and how their utilization rate is pretty low in that area.

674
00:59:13,335 --> 00:59:26,041
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyone that would drive, I don't know when they did this report, I don't know who did the study, but anyone that's familiar with that area would know the southbound, maybe not all the way up to Auburn Street, but further down, is always packed with cars.

675
00:59:26,581 --> 00:59:27,762
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's number one.

676
00:59:28,142 --> 00:59:36,486
[SPEAKER_13]: Secondly, Mr. President, has there been any report or indication how many bikes are actually using this particular area?

677
00:59:37,027 --> 00:59:38,447
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't heard anything about that.

678
00:59:38,888 --> 00:59:48,013
[SPEAKER_13]: And to me, to have a bike lane that ends at the top of Auburn and then going down a windy rest of a high street is

679
00:59:48,873 --> 00:59:56,399
[SPEAKER_13]: far more of a public safety concern when that lane ends, Mr. President, than having a fake lane for three city blocks.

680
00:59:56,779 --> 01:00:01,303
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think the area that would be a concern is not in that particular area.

681
01:00:01,483 --> 01:00:10,890
[SPEAKER_13]: It would be what happens after that, Mr. President, because the bike lane ends, as Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, right where the new intersection will be with Woburn.

682
01:00:11,861 --> 01:00:14,962
[SPEAKER_13]: So they're creating a new island there that's going to be like a fork in the road.

683
01:00:15,343 --> 01:00:20,825
[SPEAKER_13]: That's where my problem is with this particular bike lane, Mr. President.

684
01:00:20,845 --> 01:00:27,068
[SPEAKER_13]: I think you're setting up bike riders for failure in this particular area with a false sense of security.

685
01:00:27,268 --> 01:00:28,629
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all I wanted to add, Mr. President.

686
01:00:28,649 --> 01:00:31,150
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of information, Mr. President.

687
01:00:31,190 --> 01:00:33,271
[SPEAKER_07]: I think if you ask bike riders, they might disagree with you.

688
01:00:34,931 --> 01:00:35,732
[SPEAKER_07]: I completely agree.

689
01:00:35,792 --> 01:00:41,975
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we should, the windy section between Winthrop Street and Woburn Street, that'd be great, but that's not in the scope of this project.

690
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:44,456
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't think we should throw the baby out with the bathwater here.

691
01:00:45,297 --> 01:00:46,637
[SPEAKER_07]: This is going to make the street safer.

692
01:00:47,238 --> 01:00:48,198
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a dangerous street.

693
01:00:48,939 --> 01:00:54,401
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we're saying that this is the end all be all and we kill it over this and something happens, God forbid, I think that's on us.

694
01:00:54,481 --> 01:00:55,522
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm just saying here,

695
01:00:56,647 --> 01:00:58,808
[SPEAKER_07]: We shouldn't, I agree, we should talk to folks.

696
01:00:58,888 --> 01:01:10,753
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm fine moving the process forward, but if it comes down to the federal and state government saying we will not provide you with this money if you want this change, I think we really need to think hard about that because we're talking about the safety of a major thoroughfare.

697
01:01:12,294 --> 01:01:14,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

698
01:01:15,295 --> 01:01:24,539
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the funding sources are relevant at some point when, you know, well the feds are going to give us a million bucks, so let's impact the quality of life of these residents because it's not tax dollars.

699
01:01:26,283 --> 01:01:28,584
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I mean, the million bucks is the million bucks.

700
01:01:28,605 --> 01:01:29,205
[SPEAKER_12]: They're going to leave it.

701
01:01:29,245 --> 01:01:31,426
[SPEAKER_12]: Tomorrow, we're going to be just as good as we were yesterday without it.

702
01:01:31,706 --> 01:01:33,107
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, things aren't going to change.

703
01:01:33,127 --> 01:01:35,709
[SPEAKER_12]: The only way things are going to change is if we take it, Mr. President.

704
01:01:35,769 --> 01:01:37,490
[SPEAKER_12]: The only way things are going to change is if we take the money.

705
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:38,551
[SPEAKER_12]: So let's sit down.

706
01:01:38,871 --> 01:01:40,572
[SPEAKER_12]: Excuse me, I have the microphone.

707
01:01:40,852 --> 01:01:44,034
[SPEAKER_12]: So, Mr. President, ultimately, you know what I mean, I agree with Councilor Marks.

708
01:01:44,054 --> 01:01:47,557
[SPEAKER_12]: We need to have a discussion about this, and we need to figure out what we can do to protect people's quality of life.

709
01:01:47,617 --> 01:01:52,680
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe that's allowing in-accord parking in areas where bike lanes take away parking in front of their home.

710
01:01:54,015 --> 01:01:57,818
[SPEAKER_12]: That's an option, that's a solution, but it's something we need to talk about before we start going.

711
01:01:57,898 --> 01:02:06,184
[SPEAKER_12]: We've already put a bike lane down Winthrop Street, and we have a resident on Winthrop Street that every 90 days is putting an application in before the traffic commission asking them to take it out so we can park in front of his house.

712
01:02:07,285 --> 01:02:09,466
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's the reality of the situation.

713
01:02:09,507 --> 01:02:10,147
[SPEAKER_12]: It sounds great.

714
01:02:10,167 --> 01:02:11,388
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, we're making everybody safer.

715
01:02:11,408 --> 01:02:12,909
[SPEAKER_12]: These bike lanes are making everybody safer.

716
01:02:12,949 --> 01:02:14,410
[SPEAKER_12]: No one's ever going to get in a bike accident again.

717
01:02:14,670 --> 01:02:15,151
[SPEAKER_12]: Not the case.

718
01:02:15,731 --> 01:02:16,592
[SPEAKER_12]: Not the case.

719
01:02:18,117 --> 01:02:20,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Consular Knight, with your point of information.

720
01:02:20,539 --> 01:02:22,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Consular Beers, you can continue.

721
01:02:22,220 --> 01:02:31,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, again, I just think we will be worse off if something happens, and right now we are worse off because people drive 45 miles an hour down High Street, and it's incredibly dangerous.

722
01:02:31,465 --> 01:02:33,346
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just want to make that clear.

723
01:02:34,507 --> 01:02:35,167
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the question.

724
01:02:35,188 --> 01:02:36,188
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a very wide street.

725
01:02:36,949 --> 01:02:39,870
[SPEAKER_07]: This project would make it much safer, safer to cross at all hours.

726
01:02:41,251 --> 01:02:47,315
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, let's reassess the parking, but I think the idea of a bike lane to nowhere and the rhetoric we're hearing here is a little overblown, and we really

727
01:02:47,738 --> 01:02:59,742
[SPEAKER_07]: If the point of this study is to make sure that we have all our ducks in a row and we know everything, let's go with what the studies have said and what the traffic engineer and the city engineer have been saying, you know, if we really want to get there.

728
01:02:59,962 --> 01:03:05,684
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't find that the bike lane-to-nowhere thing is grounded in any sort of evidence.

729
01:03:05,984 --> 01:03:09,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, we have another unsafe situation half a mile down the street.

730
01:03:10,006 --> 01:03:11,206
[SPEAKER_07]: We should address this as well.

731
01:03:11,346 --> 01:03:16,548
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you're a biker biking up High Street towards the eastbound east,

732
01:03:17,546 --> 01:03:23,591
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm pretty sure most bikers would say they'd rather have a separated lane so they're not worried someone's going to come up at 35 miles an hour and hit them from behind.

733
01:03:25,033 --> 01:03:25,713
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

734
01:03:25,733 --> 01:03:26,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

735
01:03:29,416 --> 01:03:31,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of information, Councilor Marks.

736
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:37,303
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to clarify, it's not a separated lane.

737
01:03:37,563 --> 01:03:39,165
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a big clarification.

738
01:03:40,626 --> 01:03:42,828
[SPEAKER_13]: It's its own lane, but it's not a separated lane.

739
01:03:43,188 --> 01:03:44,830
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not separated by anything.

740
01:03:45,907 --> 01:03:47,468
[SPEAKER_13]: It's its own lane, but there's a distinction.

741
01:03:48,689 --> 01:03:49,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

742
01:03:52,411 --> 01:03:54,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of information, Councilor Bears.

743
01:03:54,592 --> 01:03:55,733
[SPEAKER_07]: A separately marked lane.

744
01:03:56,693 --> 01:03:57,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Separately marked lane, okay.

745
01:03:57,614 --> 01:03:57,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

746
01:03:58,454 --> 01:03:59,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

747
01:04:02,616 --> 01:04:03,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Caraviello.

748
01:04:03,717 --> 01:04:04,498
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

749
01:04:04,518 --> 01:04:12,642
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that happens to be the neighborhood where I live, and while everybody else was getting the phone calls, I was getting the people in my house.

750
01:04:14,419 --> 01:04:20,644
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the biggest complaints I heard was a lot of people were never even notified of this, even people on High Street.

751
01:04:20,664 --> 01:04:27,569
[SPEAKER_09]: So I know they said that they notified people, but I think maybe they just notified the people that they were taking land from.

752
01:04:28,370 --> 01:04:35,015
[SPEAKER_09]: But I heard people from Mystic Street and Austin Street, and they said there was no notification of this.

753
01:04:35,735 --> 01:04:39,178
[SPEAKER_09]: And the few that did get the notification couldn't go to the meeting at 2 o'clock.

754
01:04:40,302 --> 01:04:47,207
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's also part of the issue here, too, aside from taking the parking space away.

755
01:04:47,247 --> 01:05:04,699
[SPEAKER_09]: So this next meeting, I think there should be a little bit more notification of the neighbors, not just on High Street, but maybe some of the houses on Mystic and Hastings, where all these cars are going to end up going at some point.

756
01:05:05,079 --> 01:05:06,140
[SPEAKER_09]: So like I say,

757
01:05:07,774 --> 01:05:13,818
[SPEAKER_09]: Please make sure that there is proper notification for this next meeting, and not at 2 o'clock in the afternoon either.

758
01:05:14,519 --> 01:05:20,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, if I may, that meeting was scheduled by the Traffic Commission.

759
01:05:21,284 --> 01:05:31,272
[SPEAKER_04]: We've all had issues with when they schedule meetings because they're always at 2 p.m., which to me is just, it just gives such a disservice because most of the population can't make it at 2 p.m.

760
01:05:31,872 --> 01:05:34,034
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm in complete agreement with you on that.

761
01:05:34,475 --> 01:05:34,755
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

762
01:05:35,517 --> 01:05:35,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

763
01:05:35,857 --> 01:05:39,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Got some caviar.

764
01:05:40,039 --> 01:05:40,820
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

765
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:44,241
[SPEAKER_11]: I support exploring this a little bit further.

766
01:05:44,261 --> 01:05:49,404
[SPEAKER_11]: I was remiss during that meeting and understanding the handicapped spaces.

767
01:05:49,424 --> 01:05:56,467
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure there are no handicapped spaces that would be removed as part of this that are proposed to be removed, but just understanding that those spaces.

768
01:05:56,898 --> 01:05:59,421
[SPEAKER_11]: and the accessible spaces do remain for the people that need them.

769
01:06:00,282 --> 01:06:05,289
[SPEAKER_11]: To the point of this debate over the bike lane to nowhere, I think people are missing the point that this is a safe route to school.

770
01:06:05,869 --> 01:06:07,531
[SPEAKER_11]: So that lane is right around the school.

771
01:06:07,571 --> 01:06:12,538
[SPEAKER_11]: The idea is that children will be in that safe, protected bike lane and get to the school safely.

772
01:06:13,038 --> 01:06:31,163
[SPEAKER_11]: Adults can then merge into traffic bike riders can then merge into traffic as they are used to in many points through many cities I understand the residents who are concerned about having to cross the street if they have to park across the street The point of this project is to make that street safer so that people can cross so that people as they drive through that corridor

773
01:06:31,697 --> 01:06:36,381
[SPEAKER_11]: they see bikes, they see pedestrians, they see cars, they understand this isn't an area that I just fly through.

774
01:06:36,861 --> 01:06:46,268
[SPEAKER_11]: This is an area that has the flashing crossing right now, that has a crossing guard, and you can go to that area in the mornings and watch the crossing guard almost get hit by cars.

775
01:06:47,209 --> 01:06:56,016
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think we are running the risk of losing this money by not being able to see the forest through the trees.

776
01:06:57,061 --> 01:07:13,668
[SPEAKER_11]: And people talk about not having money to do things in Medford and we have a million dollars to make these streets safer, to make the streets safer in front of our school, to support children getting to school, to support alternative transportation to school, to remove some of the cars from the area because people are walking, because people are biking.

777
01:07:14,088 --> 01:07:16,329
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're looking for ways to lose this money.

778
01:07:17,010 --> 01:07:22,072
[SPEAKER_11]: So I do support exploring it further, seeing if there are options where we can come to a compromise.

779
01:07:22,572 --> 01:07:24,873
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think we are not seeing the bigger picture here.

780
01:07:26,555 --> 01:07:26,855
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

781
01:07:27,155 --> 01:07:28,095
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Morell.

782
01:07:29,176 --> 01:07:29,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Bears.

783
01:07:30,336 --> 01:07:31,837
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and just another point of information.

784
01:07:31,877 --> 01:07:45,381
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe that the folks from MassDOT and the city engineer said that they permit for Safe Routes to School over a five-year period, 15 to 20 projects are approved during that time, and there were at least double the applications of that.

785
01:07:45,401 --> 01:07:47,702
[SPEAKER_07]: It was an incredibly selective process.

786
01:07:47,722 --> 01:07:54,164
[SPEAKER_07]: We were one of, I believe, three projects in the whole state to be permitted, at least that's my recollection from the meeting in that year.

787
01:07:56,082 --> 01:07:59,905
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people did a lot of work to get to this point, including a lot of parents who send their kids to the Brooks School.

788
01:08:01,206 --> 01:08:02,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

789
01:08:02,087 --> 01:08:03,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President.

790
01:08:04,249 --> 01:08:06,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Caraviello is up next.

791
01:08:06,370 --> 01:08:07,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Caraviello.

792
01:08:10,433 --> 01:08:10,873
[SPEAKER_09]: It's lit here.

793
01:08:10,913 --> 01:08:15,775
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think anybody is looking to stop the project or just back away from it.

794
01:08:15,795 --> 01:08:19,276
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we're looking to revisit it and see if we can make some modifications.

795
01:08:19,776 --> 01:08:29,180
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's all that we're, I think that's all my councilors are asking for is let's see what we can do to make a happy medium to keep the residents happy and the kids going to school happy.

796
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:31,841
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I don't, I say, I don't think we're looking to stop it.

797
01:08:31,861 --> 01:08:33,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of information, Councilor Morell.

798
01:08:36,390 --> 01:08:42,016
[SPEAKER_11]: I did clarify with the city engineer that this funding is based on the multimodal.

799
01:08:42,076 --> 01:08:43,558
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's walking and biking.

800
01:08:43,658 --> 01:08:46,741
[SPEAKER_11]: So the compromise has to include biking in some way.

801
01:08:47,622 --> 01:08:48,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Morell.

802
01:08:49,404 --> 01:08:51,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Caraviello.

803
01:08:51,526 --> 01:08:51,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

804
01:08:52,307 --> 01:08:52,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks.

805
01:08:54,750 --> 01:08:55,631
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

806
01:08:55,671 --> 01:08:59,713
[SPEAKER_13]: And that was when I made my opening statement to see if we can come up with an alternative.

807
01:09:00,333 --> 01:09:04,455
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's our job as elected officials to also represent the neighborhood.

808
01:09:04,995 --> 01:09:06,256
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that's what we're doing.

809
01:09:06,276 --> 01:09:16,922
[SPEAKER_13]: And the reason why I brought it up now, Mr. President, so we wouldn't be bringing the issue up at the last hour when everything is all set in stone, all the land takings are signed off, and then they need a vote of the council.

810
01:09:17,622 --> 01:09:26,744
[SPEAKER_13]: This gives them ample time to revisit the process, Mr. President, and find out what we can do to accommodate the residents that have a hardship, Mr. President.

811
01:09:27,224 --> 01:09:28,464
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all we're asking here tonight.

812
01:09:28,684 --> 01:09:30,924
[SPEAKER_13]: We're not asking to stop the project.

813
01:09:31,184 --> 01:09:32,945
[SPEAKER_13]: We're not asking to give money back.

814
01:09:33,445 --> 01:09:34,565
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, that's a red herring.

815
01:09:34,585 --> 01:09:36,525
[SPEAKER_13]: No one's asking for that, Mr. President.

816
01:09:36,745 --> 01:09:46,147
[SPEAKER_13]: We're asking to safeguard residents that contact us and have every right to do so because it's a quality of life issue that's impacting them, Mr. President.

817
01:09:46,674 --> 01:09:50,917
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, so any project worth its weight, Mr. President, needs to be properly vetted.

818
01:09:51,238 --> 01:09:57,422
[SPEAKER_13]: The fact that the state may come in and say, well, the federal government, this is how it's going to work, that's fine for them, Mr. President.

819
01:09:57,683 --> 01:10:02,846
[SPEAKER_13]: Then it's up to us as a community to stand up and say, this works for us, and then comes for a compromise.

820
01:10:03,307 --> 01:10:04,248
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all I'm saying.

821
01:10:04,888 --> 01:10:05,849
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

822
01:10:05,909 --> 01:10:06,750
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Scarpelli.

823
01:10:07,931 --> 01:10:17,020
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, I think that was my initial input with this is that it's not something that we want to eliminate.

824
01:10:17,856 --> 01:10:19,077
[SPEAKER_14]: but it's looking for alternatives.

825
01:10:19,157 --> 01:10:31,327
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that there could be something as simple as notifying those residents that might be elderly that do qualify for handicap placards that never had an issue with that in the past that can now apply for that.

826
01:10:31,607 --> 01:10:38,593
[SPEAKER_14]: Or maybe it could be something that you look at different times where parking overnight might be an issue.

827
01:10:39,013 --> 01:10:40,555
[SPEAKER_14]: That might be the biggest issue with them.

828
01:10:40,855 --> 01:10:45,138
[SPEAKER_14]: And maybe making it so when it's the most dangerous times that

829
01:10:46,037 --> 01:10:49,238
[SPEAKER_14]: they can look at different parking restrictions.

830
01:10:49,278 --> 01:10:52,199
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's so many different variations to look at this.

831
01:10:52,239 --> 01:11:04,842
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, I don't want anybody to be confused with my input with eliminating something, or saying we don't want this money, or we don't want to keep our bicyclists safe, or we don't want our students at the Brooks.

832
01:11:04,862 --> 01:11:11,024
[SPEAKER_14]: Because to be honest with you, I got a lot of phone calls from parents from the Brooks that had some concerns.

833
01:11:11,484 --> 01:11:14,665
[SPEAKER_14]: And one of the concerns with what Councilor Knight said is that when

834
01:11:15,405 --> 01:11:21,925
[SPEAKER_14]: they do have a concern with, or an issue with the school, or they have something, there is overflow parking.

835
01:11:23,507 --> 01:11:44,658
[SPEAKER_14]: Putting them further away from the school further away from that parking area That's what they're concerned about their safety is having their child and parents or grandparents walk now that extra area so I understand you know we have some You know allegiance to our bike riders, but that's not that it's not this isn't a

836
01:11:45,738 --> 01:11:46,539
[SPEAKER_14]: for or against them.

837
01:11:46,599 --> 01:12:00,817
[SPEAKER_14]: This is something that just to look forward to a dialogue that making sure that like Councilor Caraviello said is getting those neighbors because we're now a community of transparency and making sure that everybody knows what's going on.

838
01:12:00,837 --> 01:12:02,119
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's one of the things that

839
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:13,451
[SPEAKER_14]: The feedback I did get back was that the communication was really about taking of the land, but really not defined of taking of parking spots or having the input of those residents.

840
01:12:13,951 --> 01:12:19,337
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that is a huge piece that has to be sent in that motion.

841
01:12:19,377 --> 01:12:20,678
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you, Mr. President.

842
01:12:20,859 --> 01:12:22,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

843
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:22,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Bears.

844
01:12:23,101 --> 01:12:23,982
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

845
01:12:25,657 --> 01:12:34,045
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I started my remarks saying I agree that we need to make sure that community input is what it needs to be and that everyone has a chance to get notified and have their voice on it.

846
01:12:34,125 --> 01:12:46,057
[SPEAKER_07]: I just also want to make sure that we don't, in the process of doing that, use rhetoric that may not be entirely accurate about bike lanes, that may injure or bias

847
01:12:46,950 --> 01:12:50,874
[SPEAKER_07]: The people viewing to think that one part of this project is less important than the other.

848
01:12:50,914 --> 01:12:52,496
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we're balancing needs, right?

849
01:12:52,516 --> 01:12:55,639
[SPEAKER_07]: We're talking about balancing the need for on-street parking and the need for bike safety.

850
01:12:55,679 --> 01:12:58,943
[SPEAKER_07]: And then this third need, which is what are the requirements of the project?

851
01:12:59,464 --> 01:13:01,165
[SPEAKER_07]: Or what are the requirements of the funding?

852
01:13:01,546 --> 01:13:06,992
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just think we need to be careful with the words that we use.

853
01:13:07,032 --> 01:13:08,914
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, to say that this bike lane goes to nowhere.

854
01:13:10,390 --> 01:13:12,513
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not exactly accurate to its purpose.

855
01:13:12,533 --> 01:13:14,495
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's that's the reason that I brought it forward again.

856
01:13:14,535 --> 01:13:15,516
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not biking up the street.

857
01:13:15,556 --> 01:13:16,116
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm driving.

858
01:13:16,237 --> 01:13:20,281
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, I have it's not coming from my personal experience.

859
01:13:20,942 --> 01:13:24,045
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, that's where I'm coming from on this.

860
01:13:24,285 --> 01:13:28,530
[SPEAKER_07]: And I also think we just need to make sure that we don't let people think.

861
01:13:29,931 --> 01:13:34,672
[SPEAKER_07]: You know if we want this project to go forward we need to make sure that we're being completely open that I think as admitted here.

862
01:13:34,952 --> 01:13:40,033
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to look at the options and maybe keeping on street parking in some cases won't be an option if we want to move forward.

863
01:13:40,073 --> 01:13:45,515
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't think we want through the idea of saying we want to compromise and come together on this which I don't think is a bad thing.

864
01:13:45,855 --> 01:13:51,956
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't want to think that we can also say that everyone's going to get everything they want at the end of the day because that's not really what we're in the business here.

865
01:13:52,704 --> 01:13:56,966
[SPEAKER_07]: It's it's we can't keep all the parking and do the bike lane and so maybe there's a solution here.

866
01:13:57,106 --> 01:13:57,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe there's not.

867
01:13:57,727 --> 01:13:59,127
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think we need to be open about that.

868
01:13:59,147 --> 01:14:04,110
[SPEAKER_07]: And I also think we need to be open about the timeline that we're on which is you know we have some time here.

869
01:14:04,150 --> 01:14:06,311
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this is a better time to bring it up in three months from now.

870
01:14:06,351 --> 01:14:07,852
[SPEAKER_07]: And I completely agree with that.

871
01:14:07,992 --> 01:14:13,815
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know we do have a timeline to keep for land takings and all of this to go forward.

872
01:14:13,895 --> 01:14:18,757
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just want to make sure that while we're respecting that and respecting what our reality of our options are here that we don't

873
01:14:19,152 --> 01:14:22,275
[SPEAKER_07]: let people think that they're going to get something that they're not going to get out of it as well.

874
01:14:22,495 --> 01:14:28,321
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we need to be realistic about what this final, what the end game here, what the solution might be.

875
01:14:28,682 --> 01:14:31,244
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's where I'm coming from on it.

876
01:14:31,464 --> 01:14:34,007
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's our job.

877
01:14:35,368 --> 01:14:36,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

878
01:14:36,369 --> 01:14:36,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

879
01:14:37,358 --> 01:14:39,859
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we've beaten the horse to death, Mr. President, on this one.

880
01:14:40,859 --> 01:14:41,439
[SPEAKER_04]: I would agree.

881
01:14:43,979 --> 01:14:45,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone has brought in some very valid points.

882
01:14:46,580 --> 01:14:51,381
[SPEAKER_04]: And we do have a resident that would like to speak on this, or maybe a few residents.

883
01:14:51,401 --> 01:14:53,381
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we could please have your name and address for the record.

884
01:14:53,721 --> 01:14:54,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

885
01:14:54,161 --> 01:14:55,942
[SPEAKER_06]: Jean Nuzzo, 35 Parrish Street.

886
01:14:58,322 --> 01:15:07,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely, if you've ever spent any time in West Medford on High Street in that area, while there's not a significant high number

887
01:15:07,626 --> 01:15:08,887
[SPEAKER_06]: of bicyclists.

888
01:15:09,067 --> 01:15:16,495
[SPEAKER_06]: There are many, and they travel that road faithfully, and it is a dangerous area for them to be.

889
01:15:17,376 --> 01:15:23,742
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the things that we do in the industry that you may want to consider is a mock-up... The cycling industry?

890
01:15:24,562 --> 01:15:26,584
[SPEAKER_06]: No, in the construction industry.

891
01:15:26,684 --> 01:15:29,526
[SPEAKER_12]: I do not cycle.

892
01:15:29,666 --> 01:15:31,128
[SPEAKER_06]: Although, you know, in my younger days.

893
01:15:32,168 --> 01:15:38,413
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the things we do do is we mock up and we mark out space, especially in these incremental changes.

894
01:15:38,874 --> 01:15:53,525
[SPEAKER_06]: There are organizations like Team Better Block, I think they're called, that will come in and chalk mark the area in advance so that the residents and the community can see what the impact is that you're going to affect.

895
01:15:53,986 --> 01:15:54,707
[SPEAKER_06]: for a change.

896
01:15:55,267 --> 01:16:07,537
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a lot of money, it's not a lasting change, but it allows people to see that change and then start to provide meaningful feedback because most people cannot look at a drawing

897
01:16:08,038 --> 01:16:10,740
[SPEAKER_06]: and truly conceptualize what the impact of that is.

898
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:21,288
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think we saw that down in South Medford across from the Tufts Pool, where we invested significant money to make a change to the flow of traffic.

899
01:16:21,969 --> 01:16:26,132
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's been disastrous for the neighborhood because it put all the traffic down the side street.

900
01:16:26,912 --> 01:16:34,218
[SPEAKER_06]: And while the Brooks School has a hawk signal that flashes, the Columbus School does not.

901
01:16:34,738 --> 01:16:51,281
[SPEAKER_06]: and they get a significant amount of traffic and cars flow very fastly there as do the Roberts and the McGlynn so I think holistically we have a problem with people traveling excessively fast through our city and to give attention to one school

902
01:16:51,967 --> 01:16:55,092
[SPEAKER_06]: and not mention all the others is really not equitable.

903
01:16:55,512 --> 01:16:56,494
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my first thought.

904
01:16:57,395 --> 01:17:05,927
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would encourage you to look at that opportunity, to mark up those streets and avoid the consequence that we are seeing over on Tufts.

905
01:17:07,249 --> 01:17:08,751
[SPEAKER_06]: The other point that

906
01:17:09,311 --> 01:17:26,425
[SPEAKER_06]: gives me grave concern is that we are talking about eminent domain taking of private land for public safety and usage for bike paths and sidewalks and safe schools, which are all safe walking to school, which are all important.

907
01:17:26,865 --> 01:17:30,846
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the end of the day, it's an eminent domain taking of public land.

908
01:17:31,366 --> 01:17:33,246
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is a very slippery slope.

909
01:17:33,847 --> 01:17:38,588
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would ask you, today it's this area, three months from now it may be another.

910
01:17:39,228 --> 01:17:44,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Our highest level for public safety is the site formerly known as the Lawrence Memorial Hospital.

911
01:17:45,309 --> 01:17:47,269
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you ready to take that by eminent domain?

912
01:17:48,210 --> 01:17:49,610
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a very slippery slope.

913
01:17:50,070 --> 01:17:57,353
[SPEAKER_06]: So what I would urge you to do is look at maybe marking up the space and seeing what the implications are before you open that Pandora's box.

914
01:17:57,873 --> 01:17:58,933
[SPEAKER_06]: And I thank you for your time.

915
01:17:59,413 --> 01:17:59,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

916
01:18:02,214 --> 01:18:03,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Please have your name and address for the record.

917
01:18:03,635 --> 01:18:10,977
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, my name is Melissa Miguel and I live on Bowen Ave and in full disclosure I just came here tonight to listen, wanted to see the new council, see how things are going.

918
01:18:11,437 --> 01:18:19,040
[SPEAKER_10]: What I'm hearing tonight with this bike lane is alarming to me and it's what I've been a resident of Medford for 17 years and what Medford lacks is planning.

919
01:18:20,203 --> 01:18:23,405
[SPEAKER_10]: We do not have a street and sidewalk reconstruction plan.

920
01:18:23,445 --> 01:18:25,847
[SPEAKER_10]: We just do something because the state is giving us money.

921
01:18:25,907 --> 01:18:26,468
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's do it.

922
01:18:27,108 --> 01:18:27,348
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

923
01:18:27,668 --> 01:18:31,871
[SPEAKER_10]: How do you get to this three lane, this three block bike lane in front of the Brooks?

924
01:18:31,911 --> 01:18:36,855
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we have a bicycle network plan that has identified slow, low volume?

925
01:18:37,255 --> 01:18:42,897
[SPEAKER_10]: low-speed streets for these cyclists to get there, or we're just going to say, oh, on these three blocks in front of the Brooks School, you can get safely.

926
01:18:42,917 --> 01:18:45,497
[SPEAKER_10]: But how the hell you get there, you're on your own.

927
01:18:46,158 --> 01:18:54,340
[SPEAKER_10]: I ask this council to step back and look at the city as a whole and start making five-year plans for things like bike lanes.

928
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:59,882
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not saying I'm against the bike lane, but to throw, use that money from the state to do a bike network plan.

929
01:18:59,922 --> 01:19:01,002
[SPEAKER_10]: The city of Cambridge has one.

930
01:19:03,845 --> 01:19:05,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of information, Councilor Morell.

931
01:19:06,126 --> 01:19:08,346
[SPEAKER_11]: As I understand, we do have a bike network plan.

932
01:19:09,767 --> 01:19:11,587
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know how old it is, but I have seen it.

933
01:19:11,967 --> 01:19:13,868
[SPEAKER_11]: There is a bike network plan that exists.

934
01:19:13,888 --> 01:19:16,848
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're going to connect those three blocks to the bike network plan?

935
01:19:17,048 --> 01:19:19,349
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm not here to criticize, and I'm not here to compliment.

936
01:19:19,369 --> 01:19:22,510
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just here to say we need to take a step back.

937
01:19:22,610 --> 01:19:23,490
[SPEAKER_10]: I live on Bowen Ave.

938
01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:27,651
[SPEAKER_10]: If you drive down my street, we have the Grand Canyon in front of everybody's driveway on our street.

939
01:19:27,971 --> 01:19:32,112
[SPEAKER_10]: And they come, and they fill it with cold patch, and that lasts about two days, and it goes away.

940
01:19:32,888 --> 01:19:38,131
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I asked the city, I called the city engineer, can you tell me where the Chapter 90 funding is being spent?

941
01:19:38,412 --> 01:19:40,333
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you tell me the last time Bowen Air was paved?

942
01:19:40,673 --> 01:19:43,115
[SPEAKER_10]: Nobody has any idea, not a clue.

943
01:19:44,115 --> 01:19:58,125
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just ask that when you're spending this money, you think about doing long-term planning and not plopping a three, and now what if the state doesn't give us any more money, we have no more money, and like you said, you have somebody now speeding down High Street because for three blocks they felt safe.

944
01:19:59,355 --> 01:20:13,346
[SPEAKER_10]: Why don't you tell the bikes to get off of High Street and maybe take themselves down a street that's low volume and low speed, then come up the side street and make a safe crossing across High Street to get to the Brooks School, right?

945
01:20:13,526 --> 01:20:18,149
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what those low volume, but from what everybody's saying right here, High Street is dangerous.

946
01:20:18,349 --> 01:20:21,051
[SPEAKER_10]: So why are we encouraging cyclists to go down High Street?

947
01:20:22,833 --> 01:20:23,153
[SPEAKER_10]: Good point.

948
01:20:23,782 --> 01:20:30,506
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so I ask that we take a step back, tell the state this year, thank you for your money, but we'd like to use that for planning purposes.

949
01:20:31,286 --> 01:20:43,854
[SPEAKER_10]: And I've lived here for 17 years, I have never spoken at a city council meeting, but for 17 years, I had high hopes for the new people on this council, and the new woman in the big office, and I have not seen any change in six weeks.

950
01:20:44,214 --> 01:20:49,137
[SPEAKER_10]: Full disclosure, I was on the transition committee, I want to see Medford change for the positive.

951
01:20:49,257 --> 01:20:50,878
[SPEAKER_10]: If that means bike lanes, sure.

952
01:20:51,778 --> 01:20:53,539
[SPEAKER_10]: But we can't even pave a street in Medford.

953
01:20:54,199 --> 01:20:59,481
[SPEAKER_10]: Then the cyclists are going to be complaining that they're cycling down potholes and rutted streets.

954
01:20:59,821 --> 01:21:03,842
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to take a step back and start planning the future of this city.

955
01:21:05,023 --> 01:21:09,704
[SPEAKER_10]: And I ask that we do a five-year infrastructure plan for our drainage, our sewer, our water.

956
01:21:10,084 --> 01:21:12,325
[SPEAKER_10]: A five-year plan for our streets and sidewalks.

957
01:21:13,786 --> 01:21:18,887
[SPEAKER_10]: And instead of just taking money from the state to put down three blocks of bike lane, I think it's a waste.

958
01:21:19,408 --> 01:21:20,448
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's just my opinion.

959
01:21:21,313 --> 01:21:22,214
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for listening to me.

960
01:21:22,234 --> 01:21:22,554
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

961
01:21:22,914 --> 01:21:23,835
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for coming out tonight.

962
01:21:23,875 --> 01:21:24,075
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

963
01:21:24,095 --> 01:21:27,197
[SPEAKER_10]: Appreciate it.

964
01:21:27,217 --> 01:21:28,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Morell, did you have one?

965
01:21:28,958 --> 01:21:30,579
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I could go.

966
01:21:31,179 --> 01:21:34,681
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to make this a debate about bikes, which it seems it has turned into, but just a

967
01:21:35,750 --> 01:21:40,634
[SPEAKER_11]: Many people who cycle and ride their bike to work are also own cars, drive cars.

968
01:21:41,374 --> 01:21:42,875
[SPEAKER_11]: When they're biking, they're not in their car.

969
01:21:43,196 --> 01:21:45,337
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not damaging the roads the same way a car does.

970
01:21:45,637 --> 01:21:48,059
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not adding to congestion the same way a car does.

971
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:49,380
[SPEAKER_11]: Bikes aren't perfect.

972
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:50,361
[SPEAKER_11]: None of this is perfect.

973
01:21:50,561 --> 01:21:52,603
[SPEAKER_11]: We're retrofitting old infrastructure.

974
01:21:52,883 --> 01:21:56,646
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's a bigger issue.

975
01:21:57,767 --> 01:21:58,067
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

976
01:21:58,267 --> 01:21:59,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Morell.

977
01:22:00,092 --> 01:22:00,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Bears.

978
01:22:01,413 --> 01:22:02,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, just a couple of things.

979
01:22:03,133 --> 01:22:07,895
[SPEAKER_07]: I would love to spend this money on long-term planning, but we're not allowed to by the purposes of the project.

980
01:22:07,955 --> 01:22:08,976
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been in for a few years.

981
01:22:09,376 --> 01:22:14,118
[SPEAKER_07]: The Roberts also applied, but they were not accepted, I think, mainly because of the danger.

982
01:22:14,438 --> 01:22:16,739
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's a dangerous area by the Roberts as well.

983
01:22:16,959 --> 01:22:22,982
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there were specifics to the Roberts case, not to the proposal, but to the area around there as to why it wasn't accepted.

984
01:22:23,022 --> 01:22:24,663
[SPEAKER_07]: You'd have to ask the people who didn't accept it.

985
01:22:25,743 --> 01:22:28,145
[SPEAKER_07]: But I completely agree with you we need long term planning.

986
01:22:29,546 --> 01:22:43,857
[SPEAKER_07]: My understanding is that several of the plans that you mentioned that the mayor's office and the chief of staff are working on trying to get to a street and sidewalk plan and that that's at least my understanding is that they're working to get to that point.

987
01:22:45,339 --> 01:22:48,501
[SPEAKER_07]: But they would need to update you on that and that is their job.

988
01:22:49,642 --> 01:22:50,383
[SPEAKER_07]: But yes.

989
01:22:51,618 --> 01:23:02,422
[SPEAKER_07]: In terms of this specific money and in terms of the applications for the other schools, other schools applied, it actually came from the schools with parents working with the administration of the schools.

990
01:23:03,503 --> 01:23:06,704
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, this money can't be spent on anything else.

991
01:23:07,585 --> 01:23:15,688
[SPEAKER_07]: So while I'd love to spend it on thinking bigger, this is the opportunity we have before us and I think we need to take it to make a street safer.

992
01:23:16,728 --> 01:23:18,809
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just want to say that I agree with Councilor Knight.

993
01:23:18,849 --> 01:23:21,289
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to tell the state thank you, but no thank you at this time.

994
01:23:21,849 --> 01:23:29,372
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you're going to be encouraging cyclists to cycle on three streets that everybody has said is dangerous, and they only feel safe on three blocks.

995
01:23:29,412 --> 01:23:32,292

1032
01:25:32,963 --> 01:25:42,208
[SPEAKER_04]: 20-073 offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Medford City Council request an update including but not limited to a construction schedule on the status of the Tufts Square construction project.

1033
01:25:43,483 --> 01:25:44,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

1034
01:25:44,725 --> 01:25:46,026
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1035
01:25:46,367 --> 01:25:51,633
[SPEAKER_12]: As many of us are aware, there was a complete streets project that was started down at Tufts Square.

1036
01:25:52,334 --> 01:25:59,242
[SPEAKER_12]: And it doesn't look to me as though this project is finished, but it doesn't look to me as though there's much work going on down there either, Mr. President.

1037
01:26:01,756 --> 01:26:03,459
[SPEAKER_12]: The parking area has not been striped.

1038
01:26:03,799 --> 01:26:10,168
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no shrubbery or any type of ballast or anything like that that I believe were part of the plan that were going to be put in there.

1039
01:26:10,208 --> 01:26:15,076
[SPEAKER_12]: It looks like there's a problem with the gradient and pitch as well, Mr. President.

1040
01:26:15,096 --> 01:26:16,878
[SPEAKER_12]: It looks like in a rainstorm the.

1041
01:26:18,053 --> 01:26:24,158
[SPEAKER_12]: rain would puddle up quite a bit going down towards the Citizens Bank area of the parking lot over there.

1042
01:26:24,218 --> 01:26:36,128
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm hoping that we can get an update from the city administration, including but not limited to the construction schedule, where we are in the process, what percentage of the project is complete at this point in time.

1043
01:26:37,248 --> 01:26:47,853
[SPEAKER_12]: Ultimately, Mr. President, if you think about that little Tufts Square area, and you think about all the businesses that were there, it's a very historic area, very important to the heritage and history of Medford.

1044
01:26:48,374 --> 01:26:58,919
[SPEAKER_12]: I was just talking to a friend of mine just the other day on Golden Ave, Michael Price, who showed me a newspaper article of Dolly's Beauty Salon down right there in Tufts Square.

1045
01:26:59,199 --> 01:27:05,322
[SPEAKER_12]: And Dolly, his mother, was the youngest hair salon owner ever licensed

1046
01:27:06,596 --> 01:27:08,517
[SPEAKER_12]: in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts at age 15.

1047
01:27:09,157 --> 01:27:12,098
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President, she was a business owner at age 15 right there in Tufts Square.

1048
01:27:12,898 --> 01:27:26,642
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's my hope that we can remember the good things of that square and the good businesses and the good legacies that were left behind by honoring them a little bit more with the completion of this construction project, Mr. President, and also when the time is right

1049
01:27:27,235 --> 01:27:48,012
[SPEAKER_12]: Hopefully maybe a history board or a story board down there, but at this point in time I would just like to ask for an update from the administration as to what's going on with the tough square project where we are and When it's going to be complete and what the construction schedule looks like Thank You console night console beers I'd just like to amend this paper to ask the administration also if they have any data or information on the impact of the change in

1050
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:57,943
[SPEAKER_07]: intersection orientation on traffic, and also if they have any data or anecdotes on the impact of the Broadway bus lane on there.

1051
01:27:59,643 --> 01:28:00,024
[SPEAKER_07]: Repeat it.

1052
01:28:00,184 --> 01:28:02,584
[SPEAKER_03]: If you could please repeat that to the clerk.

1053
01:28:02,804 --> 01:28:03,685
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

1054
01:28:03,925 --> 01:28:17,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Amendment to ask if the change in the intersection has, if they have data on the impact on traffic, and then also if there has been a traffic impact from the Broadway bus lanes installed by the city of Somerville.

1055
01:28:25,531 --> 01:28:30,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, on the motion of Council Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, as amended by Councilor Bears.
