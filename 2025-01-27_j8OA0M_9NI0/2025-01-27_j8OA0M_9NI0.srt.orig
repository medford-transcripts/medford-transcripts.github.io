[SPEAKER_04]: Forgive me.

00:55:30,073 --> 00:55:30,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you're right.

12
00:55:31,113 --> 00:55:31,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

13
00:55:31,393 --> 00:55:32,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember Graham's online.

00:55:32,634 --> 00:55:33,534
[SPEAKER_04]: So do a roll call.

[SPEAKER_00]: Um, member Brantley.

00:55:35,374 --> 00:55:36,715
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember Graham?

17
00:55:37,275 --> 00:55:37,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

18
00:55:37,555 --> 00:55:39,156
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember in Tapa?

19
00:55:39,416 --> 00:55:39,536
Yes.

20
00:55:39,556 --> 00:55:40,716
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember all a party?

21
00:55:40,796 --> 00:55:41,036
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

22
00:55:41,056 --> 00:55:41,517
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember?

23
00:55:41,557 --> 00:55:42,037
[SPEAKER_00]: Reinfeldt?

24
00:55:42,457 --> 00:55:42,837
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember?

00:55:42,877 --> 00:55:43,937
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, Mayor Lunker.

26
00:55:44,958 --> 00:55:45,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

27
00:55:45,558 --> 00:55:46,698
[SPEAKER_04]: 70 affirmative zero negative.

28
00:55:46,778 --> 00:55:48,259
[SPEAKER_04]: The consent agenda is approved.

29
00:55:49,222 --> 00:55:51,065
[SPEAKER_04]: We do not have any reports of subcommittees.

30
00:55:51,405 --> 00:55:54,429
[SPEAKER_04]: We have two reports under the reports of the superintendent.

31
00:55:55,250 --> 00:55:57,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Interim superintendent's transition plan.

32
00:55:57,353 --> 00:56:01,279
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to turn it over to Dr. Suzanne B. Galussi, our interim superintendent.

33
00:56:01,299 --> 00:56:03,322
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, thank you.

34
00:56:05,095 --> 00:56:06,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening, everybody.

35
00:56:06,535 --> 00:56:14,958
[SPEAKER_03]: It's with great enthusiasm and a deep sense of responsibility that I sit in this seat as the new interim superintendent for Medford Public Schools.

36
00:56:15,758 --> 00:56:28,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Having grown up in Medford and worked in the district for about 28 years, I'm really truly honored to have this responsibility to give back to a community that has shaped me so much.

37
00:56:29,102 --> 00:56:34,444
[SPEAKER_03]: I will dive deeper into my transition plans as it relates to this interim role in just a few minutes.

38
00:56:35,091 --> 00:56:50,703
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would like to start with the district's response shared with the Medford Public Schools community last Friday to the recent federal executive order surrounding federal immigration and Title IX.

39
00:56:52,125 --> 00:57:03,894
[SPEAKER_03]: So we understand that our students, which are the true heartbeat of Medford Public Schools, could be feeling a wide range of emotions and some trepidation over these executive orders.

40
00:57:04,984 --> 00:57:14,046
[SPEAKER_03]: The language and the rhetoric that the students and families hear from the news may heighten the stress in our school communities and in our greater community.

41
00:57:15,026 --> 00:57:31,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Our staff members and our district leaders have always and will continue to foster a sense of belonging in our schools that celebrates each student's individuality, their diverse backgrounds, and their many talents.

42
00:57:32,730 --> 00:57:47,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Their diverse and unique perspectives enhance the climate of our schools and fostering that connection and inclusion are core principles for our schools and relate directly to our instructional vision.

43
00:57:48,539 --> 00:57:56,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Medford Public Schools is committed to educating all students in inclusive learning environments because we want our students to feel heard.

44
00:57:56,503 --> 00:57:57,604
[SPEAKER_03]: We want them to feel safe.

45
00:57:58,244 --> 00:58:01,286
[SPEAKER_03]: We want them to feel valued and welcomed and appreciated.

46
00:58:03,172 --> 00:58:17,974
[SPEAKER_03]: So while there's been no enforcement activities on school grounds or any requests for information, it's important that the district's current policies are still in place surrounding federal immigration, Title IX.

47
00:58:18,558 --> 00:58:22,119
[SPEAKER_03]: and LGBTQIA plus students.

48
00:58:22,359 --> 00:58:36,622
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of those just, they were reflected in my memo, but I'm going to also make sure that they're clarified here, that the district is committing, is committed to serving all students whose principal Doss Mile is Medford public, is Medford, excuse me.

49
00:58:37,542 --> 00:58:42,884
[SPEAKER_03]: We do not request any immigration information as part of the registration process, nor will we.

50
00:58:44,004 --> 00:58:47,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Students are dismissed only to the approved

51
00:58:48,565 --> 00:58:54,226
[SPEAKER_03]: consent from their caregiver as to the people that can pick them up from school.

52
00:58:55,887 --> 00:59:12,030
[SPEAKER_03]: We follow all regulations for FERPA and district policy in relation to the student information that we have is strictly we strictly follow FERPA regulations which means we're not giving out information especially without parent consent

53
00:59:12,770 --> 00:59:13,891
[SPEAKER_03]: written within that statute.

54
00:59:14,472 --> 00:59:22,659
[SPEAKER_03]: And our Title IX policies, as we most recently updated, reflective to the 2024, they have not changed.

55
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:25,282
[SPEAKER_03]: And so those will remain and stay in place.

56
00:59:26,997 --> 00:59:49,100
[SPEAKER_03]: All of our NPS staff members received communication about this last week and our building principals are receiving communication and guidance on an ongoing basis so that they can make sure that their staff is well informed and has a sense of they understand what the communication protocol is moving forward.

57
00:59:50,557 --> 00:59:59,002
[SPEAKER_03]: We recognize that this subject is constantly evolving, and so there'll be additional items on tonight's agenda surrounding this important topic.

58
00:59:59,582 --> 01:00:09,868
[SPEAKER_03]: However, the well-being of our students is paramount to the functioning of Medford Public Schools, and we are committed to protecting the rights and the safety of all of our students.

59
01:00:13,290 --> 01:00:19,053
[SPEAKER_03]: So for tonight, I'm going to talk a little bit about the transition plan.

60
01:00:22,928 --> 01:00:23,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

61
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:30,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Cushing, you can go to the third page.

62
01:00:30,052 --> 01:00:34,154
[SPEAKER_03]: This second page is the letter that I has sent out to the MPS community.

63
01:00:35,014 --> 01:00:38,936
[SPEAKER_03]: I will make sure that this plan, after being discussed this evening, goes on our website.

64
01:00:39,016 --> 01:00:45,719
[SPEAKER_03]: So if people would like to be able to access it or view it, it will be on our Medford Public Schools website.

65
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:50,622
[SPEAKER_03]: That will be the letter again, if people maybe just didn't get it in email form last week.

66
01:00:51,906 --> 01:01:08,219
[SPEAKER_03]: So the purpose of this entry plan and transitional plan is just to inform the community about my thinking and some of the activities that will be in place to help guide the transition to try to make it as stable and continuous as possible.

67
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:14,925
[SPEAKER_03]: So the purpose is to ensure a thoughtful transition from the current superintendent to the interim superintendent.

68
01:01:15,564 --> 01:01:29,554
[SPEAKER_03]: to provide an outline for and convey information related to mid-year transition, ensuring consistency and stability, and to inform the school community about transitional activities to continue building relationships.

69
01:01:31,936 --> 01:01:34,598
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is a theory of action.

70
01:01:35,601 --> 01:01:55,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is to just have a, the goal for me in this is to just have a structured and thoughtful process, so that if we, if I'm emphasizing the importance of nurturing those ongoing relationships that I've already kind of started to build but will continue and still grow with stakeholders within the

71
01:01:56,704 --> 01:02:13,035
[SPEAKER_03]: school department as well as within the community and capitalizing on the strengths and opportunities within that community, then the possible disruptions to any sort of education will be effectively minimized.

72
01:02:13,355 --> 01:02:19,079
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the goal is to make this as seamless as possible for our community, for our students and for our staff.

73
01:02:20,567 --> 01:02:37,861
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to draw upon my professional institutional knowledge along with the established community connections that I have to build a strong foundation and create to support a smooth and successful leadership transition.

74
01:02:39,210 --> 01:02:45,431
[SPEAKER_03]: with that being said, there are some key areas that I am going to focus on within this transition.

75
01:02:46,351 --> 01:02:56,654
[SPEAKER_03]: So first, as mentioned, is to continue building those relationships within the community and continue stakeholder communication.

76
01:02:58,914 --> 01:03:01,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Also for operational overview,

77
01:03:04,512 --> 01:03:09,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Dr. Cushing, just leave it right there for one second, because I'm just going to go through them and then.

78
01:03:10,454 --> 01:03:29,159
[SPEAKER_03]: The fiscal year 26 budget, ongoing contract negotiations within the district, the ongoing MSBA process for a new Medford High School, and then our plans to begin and launch for the 25-26 school year.

79
01:03:29,719 --> 01:03:31,400
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to briefly talk

80
01:03:32,778 --> 01:03:34,660
[SPEAKER_03]: an overview of all of those areas.

81
01:03:36,422 --> 01:03:50,654
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first one is the Continued Relationship Development and Stakeholder Communication, which will foster collaborative, trusting, and transparent relationships with all stakeholders, ensuring responsiveness to the needs of the Medford Public Schools community.

82
01:03:51,535 --> 01:04:01,683
[SPEAKER_03]: And so with that being said, some of those action items within that would be the welcome letters, which were sent to caregivers as well as staff last week.

83
01:04:02,864 --> 01:04:09,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Some meet and greet opportunities for caregivers as well as for staff.

84
01:04:10,070 --> 01:04:20,518
[SPEAKER_03]: So for the staff opportunities, I'm going to each of the schools and offering an opportunity to come and meet

85
01:04:20,925 --> 01:04:31,162
[SPEAKER_03]: and for me to listen and hear some feedback, hear any questions or concerns, or just for an opportunity to touch base, that will be a dismissal time.

86
01:04:32,063 --> 01:04:35,449
[SPEAKER_03]: I started last week and I'm continuing until I've gone to every school.

87
01:04:36,897 --> 01:04:42,919
[SPEAKER_03]: For the caregivers, I'm finalizing the schedule right now in collaboration with some of the principals.

88
01:04:43,540 --> 01:04:47,261
[SPEAKER_03]: So I am going to offer two opportunities for school communities.

89
01:04:48,462 --> 01:04:58,146
[SPEAKER_03]: One at arrival in person in the morning to capture for some families, mornings are more accessible to them and for some it's evenings.

90
01:04:58,586 --> 01:05:03,868
[SPEAKER_03]: I will also offer an evening opportunity via Zoom for each school community.

91
01:05:04,342 --> 01:05:18,895
[SPEAKER_03]: that will allow for hopefully that continued rapport and relationship building and where I can really have a conversation with each school community and hear input from them.

92
01:05:20,837 --> 01:05:26,742
[SPEAKER_03]: As you may have saw last week, we've gotten lots of feedback about how people really feel

93
01:05:28,095 --> 01:05:36,218
[SPEAKER_03]: that weekly communication is a critical instrument for them to stay connected to the schools, learn what's going on in the district.

94
01:05:36,298 --> 01:05:40,639
[SPEAKER_03]: So continuing that Friday memo was of importance for the community.

95
01:05:41,199 --> 01:05:51,382
[SPEAKER_03]: So it might just be a little rebranded, but that will stay in place and still go out every Friday afternoon so that you can keep up to date with what's happening around the district.

96
01:05:53,363 --> 01:06:04,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then also is an opportunity for me to branch off to other, um, positions and organizations within the district that I want to have, um, personal.

97
01:06:05,807 --> 01:06:11,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Meetings with, um, those may be on the city side in terms of our, um, city department leaders.

98
01:06:12,088 --> 01:06:15,449
[SPEAKER_03]: They're on the school side in terms of our administration and school leaders.

99
01:06:16,130 --> 01:06:19,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and they're also very critical school organizations.

100
01:06:20,311 --> 01:06:20,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Um,

101
01:06:21,111 --> 01:06:29,720
[SPEAKER_03]: such as CPAC and LPAC, that I want to make sure that I have a meeting with those important organizations.

102
01:06:31,282 --> 01:06:42,453
[SPEAKER_03]: The operational overview is to enhance understanding of district operations, collaboratively identify key priorities, and foster a culture of trust, transparency, and efficiency.

103
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:51,607
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm going to be holding lots of regular meetings to identify short and long-term priorities.

104
01:06:52,127 --> 01:07:00,914
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first bullet is that continued and ongoing focus and overview of academics, which is the position that I was in.

105
01:07:01,455 --> 01:07:07,159
[SPEAKER_03]: And so for the duration of this year, there will be a lot of oversight still on my part.

106
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:14,664
[SPEAKER_03]: to make sure that the academic gains and the systems and structures we have in place are going to continue.

107
01:07:15,185 --> 01:07:16,806
[SPEAKER_03]: So that won't change.

108
01:07:18,587 --> 01:07:33,937
[SPEAKER_03]: And then because I have spent my world, my time in the academic world, I do have to make sure that I am having those standing meetings with areas such as finance, facilities, IT, athletics and community schools.

109
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:46,217
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's gonna broaden my understanding of those areas and make sure that ongoing compliance is happening and that I can identify opportunities for improvement.

110
01:07:47,945 --> 01:08:05,194
[SPEAKER_03]: So the fiscal year 26 budget, I will help to lead the budget process with a focus on timeliness and strategic investment, ensuring it aligns with the needs of Memphis Public Schools community while supporting the core values as referenced in our instructional vision.

111
01:08:06,995 --> 01:08:27,396
[SPEAKER_03]: So that also will be regular meetings that I have already set up with the finance team so that I can discuss everything related to all budgetary matters and then ensure adherence to transparent and collaborative budget development process.

112
01:08:29,701 --> 01:08:31,602
[SPEAKER_03]: The other piece would be contract negotiations.

113
01:08:31,703 --> 01:08:44,132
[SPEAKER_03]: So engage in negotiations with bargaining units to build collaborative relationships, address the interests and concerns of varied employees within the district, and improve district operations and outcomes.

114
01:08:44,973 --> 01:08:56,381
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have lots of bargaining units in this district, and several of which we will be engaging with or are continuing to engage with throughout this year.

115
01:08:58,404 --> 01:09:04,695
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be the teachers, the administrators, maintenance, paraprofessionals, food service, and nurses.

116
01:09:06,778 --> 01:09:11,887
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is a significant amount of work that will be happening and continuing to happen this year.

117
01:09:14,951 --> 01:09:25,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Along that thread is also the ongoing MSBA, so the Massachusetts School Building Authority process that we engaged in for Medford High School.

118
01:09:25,675 --> 01:09:28,236
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was on that board previously.

119
01:09:28,336 --> 01:09:36,720
[SPEAKER_03]: My role clearly will shift, but participating in that process to explore funding opportunities and develop a strategic plan.

120
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:42,182
[SPEAKER_03]: for building a new Medford High School that meets the needs of our students and the community.

121
01:09:43,242 --> 01:09:48,244
[SPEAKER_03]: So that will continue and I know that our meetings will kick up in the next month or two.

122
01:09:49,224 --> 01:09:53,166
[SPEAKER_03]: And then finally is to plan for the school year 25-26.

123
01:09:53,186 --> 01:09:53,226
[SPEAKER_03]: So

124
01:09:57,117 --> 01:10:08,804
[SPEAKER_03]: The goal is to take all of this data that I will be gathering in all of these meetings that I will be having to help inform the plans for 25, 26 school year.

125
01:10:09,484 --> 01:10:21,672
[SPEAKER_03]: And so some of those just, this is not limited to, but some of those things that are on the forefront for me would be extended learning opportunities for the summer.

126
01:10:23,013 --> 01:10:42,151
[SPEAKER_03]: as well as the academic programming for the summer, filling personnel vacancies and looking hard at staffing needs across the district, ensuring that our academic goals are continued and our instructional vision is fully aligned with all that we do in Medford Public Schools.

127
01:10:44,673 --> 01:10:46,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Our strategic plan is

128
01:10:47,393 --> 01:10:57,297
[SPEAKER_03]: outdated, so looking at what that will look like, transitioning that to align with our instructional vision that we created is also going to be part of the work.

129
01:10:58,278 --> 01:11:07,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Identifying operational goals as a result of the meetings, so what will be important for us in terms of making shifts or adding some additional processes.

130
01:11:08,582 --> 01:11:12,244
[SPEAKER_03]: A review of internal systems and structures for how we're operating and functioning.

131
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:16,822
[SPEAKER_03]: and see if there are ways that we can be operating better and more efficiently.

132
01:11:17,862 --> 01:11:24,586
[SPEAKER_03]: And then a review of district enrollment and school assignment procedures that reflect our most immediate challenges.

133
01:11:25,406 --> 01:11:41,595
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that will be an ongoing review process that I know will most definitely look at the Roberts Elementary School, which is overcrowded and we need to be looking at what that looks like in operation and how we can

134
01:11:42,536 --> 01:11:49,405
[SPEAKER_03]: work to alleviate some of that moving forward, as well as our middle school lottery process.

135
01:11:50,426 --> 01:11:57,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are two that are at the forefront, but others may emerge from some of this work that I'm going to be doing across the district.

136
01:11:59,376 --> 01:12:21,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Additionally, just last few would be our professional development planning, our administrative retreat that we have to start the school year, the convocation or the opening that we have with teachers to really set the vision and the goal for next year so that we start on a successful note, and also what our new teacher induction planning looks like.

137
01:12:22,564 --> 01:12:23,705
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are just a few things.

138
01:12:23,745 --> 01:12:34,812
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to take any questions if anyone has any questions for me, but thank you for the time for me to review my thinking in this transition.

139
01:12:34,952 --> 01:12:40,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much, Dr. Galussi, for the well thought out transition plan.

140
01:12:40,616 --> 01:12:45,460
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we did receive this a few days ago, so I'm sure everybody got a chance to review it.

141
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:48,682
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's any questions from the floor, if not, I'm going to move on to

142
01:12:49,532 --> 01:12:53,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Number two, which is summer fun program.

143
01:12:54,479 --> 01:12:56,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Invite Dr. Peter Cushing, assistant superintendent up.

144
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:10,741
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, the red still confused me.

145
01:13:10,841 --> 01:13:12,822
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening, Madam Mayor, members of the school committee.

146
01:13:12,842 --> 01:13:20,326
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for hearing me out today on our rate card presentation, specifically tailored to summer fun.

147
01:13:21,227 --> 01:13:25,449
[SPEAKER_08]: Also on the call this evening is the director of the program, Anthony Petrellis.

148
01:13:26,309 --> 01:13:33,614
[SPEAKER_08]: For those in the community who aren't aware, Summer Fun is a six-week camp run by the Medford Public Schools that runs daily from 7.30 a.m.

149
01:13:33,654 --> 01:13:34,675
[SPEAKER_08]: to 4.30 p.m.

150
01:13:34,775 --> 01:13:38,717
[SPEAKER_08]: and it starts basically the week of July 4th and runs six weeks from that point forward.

151
01:13:40,038 --> 01:13:48,464
[SPEAKER_08]: The program, starting last year, now provides free meals to students under the Medford Public Schools School Nutrition Program.

152
01:13:49,524 --> 01:14:00,089
[SPEAKER_08]: The program has been held at the Mississippi, I believe, for the past three or four years since we moved from Medford High School, and they also utilize the Tufts pool for part of their daily swimming activities.

153
01:14:00,109 --> 01:14:07,592
[SPEAKER_08]: The program operates with a director and two assistant directors and operates for five days a week, with the exception of the July 4th week.

154
01:14:08,112 --> 01:14:11,433
[SPEAKER_08]: Currently, the camp is charging $200 per week.

155
01:14:14,215 --> 01:14:23,628
[SPEAKER_08]: In comparison to other programs, those are north of $500 for similarly situated programs.

156
01:14:25,181 --> 01:14:33,185
[SPEAKER_08]: The director has recently started a three-day program for counselor and training for middle school students at a rate of $75 per week.

157
01:14:33,625 --> 01:14:37,506
[SPEAKER_08]: And the district, we're proposing a rate increase for this summer.

158
01:14:37,526 --> 01:14:41,248
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm interested to hear feedback from the committee on that.

159
01:14:42,108 --> 01:14:46,470
[SPEAKER_08]: Increasing to $275 per week for residents and Medford employees.

160
01:14:47,310 --> 01:14:51,392
[SPEAKER_08]: The rate has not been increased for at least six years based on our research

161
01:14:51,872 --> 01:14:53,533
[SPEAKER_08]: And prior to that, the rate was $175.

162
01:14:53,593 --> 01:14:58,295
[SPEAKER_08]: We're also proposing a rate for non-Medford residents of $300.

163
01:14:58,375 --> 01:15:03,717
[SPEAKER_08]: The CIT rate is not proposed to increase as a part of this.

164
01:15:04,477 --> 01:15:06,838
[SPEAKER_08]: And the district is interested, as I said, in your feedback.

165
01:15:09,020 --> 01:15:24,510
[SPEAKER_08]: This is part of the rate card because we're trying to make sure that everything that district charges a fee for comes before the committee as it should and is codified and easily available and easy to understand rate card for the city.

166
01:15:24,570 --> 01:15:25,210
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you.

167
01:15:26,151 --> 01:15:26,351
[SPEAKER_08]: And.

168
01:15:28,092 --> 01:15:28,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

169
01:15:29,273 --> 01:15:29,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Russo.

170
01:15:31,105 --> 01:15:34,889
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the focus on having us approve all the things you're supposed to approve.

171
01:15:36,590 --> 01:15:42,116
[SPEAKER_00]: How many people who are not residents and not employees actually use this program?

172
01:15:42,876 --> 01:15:48,322
[SPEAKER_08]: When I spoke to Mr. Petrales, who's on the call, if I remember correctly, and feel free to correct me, it was about 10.

173
01:15:50,003 --> 01:15:50,324
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

174
01:15:52,085 --> 01:15:52,706
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of how many?

175
01:15:53,300 --> 01:15:54,581
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, but it's in the report.

176
01:15:54,881 --> 01:16:02,088
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Petrales, can you give me, I think it was 120 was the max per week last year, but Anthony, would you be able to add that?

177
01:16:07,653 --> 01:16:10,015
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm pretty sure I made him a co-host, but let me just close up.

178
01:16:16,261 --> 01:16:16,481
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello?

179
01:16:17,775 --> 01:16:18,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there he is.

180
01:16:18,697 --> 01:16:19,318
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, there we are.

181
01:16:19,799 --> 01:16:20,581
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't do video.

182
01:16:20,601 --> 01:16:21,723
[SPEAKER_07]: It won't let me do video.

183
01:16:21,763 --> 01:16:23,907
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you guys can hear me, that's totally fine.

184
01:16:26,312 --> 01:16:27,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, what was the question again?

185
01:16:29,208 --> 01:16:37,812
[SPEAKER_00]: How many participants are there and how many of them are people who are not residents or employees who pay the higher rate?

186
01:16:38,732 --> 01:16:41,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, so it really depends.

187
01:16:41,233 --> 01:16:43,594
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I feel like from some of the summer that's different.

188
01:16:43,674 --> 01:16:49,556
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I said at the Dr. Cushman when we met before, I mean, last summer there was no more than 10 kids that were out of district.

189
01:16:49,636 --> 01:16:55,559
[SPEAKER_07]: And most of the kids that were out of district might've been parents who worked within the city of Medford that reached out to us.

190
01:16:55,919 --> 01:17:04,084
[SPEAKER_07]: We did require physical just to kind of make sure that, you know, from our end, we did our homework to make sure if there was any accommodations that we might need to make for our camp, we did.

191
01:17:04,104 --> 01:17:12,748
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but those numbers are really low and just, they fluctuate from year to year, but I would say no more than 10 kids per summer that we have that are out of district.

192
01:17:14,269 --> 01:17:14,589
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

193
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:15,330
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

194
01:17:20,213 --> 01:17:20,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Brantley.

195
01:17:23,106 --> 01:17:29,443
[SPEAKER_06]: With this increase, I'm just curious, does the increase in tuition increase the director or the assistant director of pay?

196
01:17:30,396 --> 01:17:32,297
[SPEAKER_08]: That's one of the things that we have to discuss.

197
01:17:32,357 --> 01:17:37,660
[SPEAKER_08]: That pay has remained static since 2014 for the director.

198
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:41,342
[SPEAKER_08]: And prior to that, it was static for six years.

199
01:17:41,702 --> 01:17:47,045
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe there was an increase in 2008, another increase, or I shouldn't say there was an increase.

200
01:17:47,506 --> 01:17:49,787
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Petrella started in 2008.

201
01:17:50,007 --> 01:17:51,588
[SPEAKER_08]: There was an increase in 2014.

202
01:17:51,868 --> 01:17:54,109
[SPEAKER_08]: He sent me the data today.

203
01:17:54,129 --> 01:17:58,512
[SPEAKER_08]: I looked at it quickly and there has been no increase in the past 10 or 11 summers.

204
01:17:59,792 --> 01:17:59,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

205
01:18:00,734 --> 01:18:06,549
[SPEAKER_06]: So my question, does the increase in tuition, would the money come out of that?

206
01:18:07,187 --> 01:18:09,208
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, this is a self-funding program.

207
01:18:09,749 --> 01:18:17,875
[SPEAKER_08]: We'd also like to make sure that right now, Mr. Petrellis let me know that the program basically starts with a zero balance.

208
01:18:18,495 --> 01:18:26,781
[SPEAKER_08]: So what we'd like to do is we'd like to start making sure that he has the ability to pre-purchase items and make sure the camp has everything it needs to.

209
01:18:27,201 --> 01:18:30,964
[SPEAKER_08]: And it should be able to self-sustain itself as it has done in the past.

210
01:18:31,504 --> 01:18:32,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we usually make a profit?

211
01:18:33,598 --> 01:18:35,099
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, if I could chime in.

212
01:18:35,139 --> 01:18:38,821
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so last year we made about a $25,000 profit.

213
01:18:38,841 --> 01:18:42,444
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, give or take a little bit here or there, but that's about the rough number.

214
01:18:43,845 --> 01:18:45,806
[SPEAKER_07]: I know we mentioned earlier about the price increase.

215
01:18:45,826 --> 01:19:00,355
[SPEAKER_07]: The one thing I'd say is I think it's really important just to kind of put in the perspective that we do offer as a school district a really good camp at a really reasonable, cheaper price than most places, but it's sustained almost 20 years.

216
01:19:00,375 --> 01:19:01,336
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been the director of it at 18.

217
01:19:02,957 --> 01:19:09,699
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one of those things that I think it's we're really lucky to be able to provide a place that people can afford.

218
01:19:10,159 --> 01:19:14,580
[SPEAKER_07]: And to me, you know, I know we mentioned 75 and I mean, majority of these people on here are my bosses.

219
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:16,560
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm not telling anybody what to do on this call.

220
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:32,544
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, to me, I just felt like maybe 50 will be a little bit more reasonable, I think, especially maybe for parents that, you know, just had their taxes raised as well to kind of hit them with, you know, a decent size increase on a camp that's been really affordable for a long time, I think.

221
01:19:33,124 --> 01:19:48,150
[SPEAKER_07]: Is a tough ask a little bit just knowing the camp and being a part of it for so long, but it did make a profit last year, and some years, you know, some years and made a bigger profits and others it also depends on enrollment and over the years method recreations come into town and.

222
01:19:48,550 --> 01:19:52,313
[SPEAKER_07]: coaches have clinics and camps and you have power kids and six acres.

223
01:19:52,393 --> 01:19:59,618
[SPEAKER_07]: And so there's a lot of competition maybe than there was five or six years ago, uh, when we were just maybe the only pony in town a little bit.

224
01:19:59,638 --> 01:20:03,620
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just want you guys to kind of keep that in mind also in like the bigger picture of things.

225
01:20:05,001 --> 01:20:05,442
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

226
01:20:05,462 --> 01:20:10,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, do we ensure that Memphis public school students are accepted first?

227
01:20:10,985 --> 01:20:11,846
[SPEAKER_06]: I know there's only 10 per se.

228
01:20:11,866 --> 01:20:14,568
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to make sure that, that we're,

229
01:20:15,935 --> 01:20:19,016
[SPEAKER_07]: I never turn anybody away, honestly, I've never turned anyone away.

230
01:20:19,036 --> 01:20:20,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, no, that's fine.

231
01:20:22,297 --> 01:20:25,037
[SPEAKER_06]: And then how much of the profit goes back into the program?

232
01:20:25,057 --> 01:20:31,399
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I know you said he starts with zero, but like, does some of that profit go back to him to say, okay, you have a like a budget?

233
01:20:31,639 --> 01:20:32,399
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have a budget?

234
01:20:32,479 --> 01:20:36,600
[SPEAKER_08]: That's one of the things that we're looking to make sure that's that has not been really done in the past.

235
01:20:37,060 --> 01:20:38,600
[SPEAKER_08]: It's part of the community schools program.

236
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:44,862
[SPEAKER_08]: So anything he needs, but as far as compartmentalizing, that's something that we want to make sure that we're looking at.

237
01:20:46,397 --> 01:20:51,525
[SPEAKER_06]: And then just for Mr. Petrales, do you feel like you are staffed properly with 120 kids?

238
01:20:56,237 --> 01:20:58,199
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if I could have like a million councils, that'd be great.

239
01:20:58,219 --> 01:21:08,128
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, right now, I think where we're at in the current staffing that we have yet, you know, I'm always careful with numbers, and I'm always careful with the finances and stuff and not overstaffing too much.

240
01:21:08,588 --> 01:21:16,055
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the one thing for us that makes us like unique is that we also accept a lot of walk-ins day of families that have last minute emergencies or

241
01:21:16,515 --> 01:21:32,667
[SPEAKER_07]: weren't able to get in somewhere else and we do provide that so keeping um you know maybe hiring a little bit extra sometimes anticipating you know the average of 10 to 15 walk-ins per week that you're not expecting um you know we try to be smart and and aware of what we're doing.

242
01:21:32,687 --> 01:21:40,453
[SPEAKER_06]: Does do the people that we're hiring does that um does that expense come out of the profit?

243
01:21:41,254 --> 01:21:41,374
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

244
01:21:41,890 --> 01:21:44,035
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, so last year we brought in about $120,000.

245
01:21:44,075 --> 01:21:45,799
[SPEAKER_08]: Our expenses in the neighborhood of $100,000 were largely personnel related.

246
01:21:45,819 --> 01:21:46,541
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, perfect.

247
01:21:51,357 --> 01:21:51,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay great.

248
01:21:51,897 --> 01:21:52,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are my questions.

249
01:21:52,637 --> 01:21:52,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

250
01:21:53,157 --> 01:21:53,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for doing this.

251
01:21:53,918 --> 01:21:54,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Member Granley.

252
01:21:55,138 --> 01:21:58,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to, if I may, from the Chair, and then I'm going to turn it to Member Graham.

253
01:21:58,499 --> 01:22:13,602
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't want, I want to point out something Mr. Petrellis mentioned, that this is an affordable camp that people of all different economic backgrounds use, including many that can't afford six acres and

254
01:22:14,169 --> 01:22:28,590
[SPEAKER_04]: being one that started the program myself and former school committee member in recoup know that was the whole premise and that's the whole reason why we wanted to bring camp into Medford to blow six acres out of, you know, away as far as how much it costs.

255
01:22:29,391 --> 01:22:31,953
[SPEAKER_04]: kids who can't afford six acres have that opportunity.

256
01:22:32,453 --> 01:22:48,463
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would just make a suggestion if, I know we can't make amendments on the floor, but just to people to think about maybe spreading that $75 increase out over two years, just to make it a little bit more digestible for families, like Mr. Petrella said, that are struggling to get by.

257
01:22:48,483 --> 01:22:53,366
[SPEAKER_04]: I know my son loves this program, and if it was a sliding scale, then I should be paying

258
01:22:54,927 --> 01:22:59,036
[SPEAKER_04]: more than a lot of people that I know attend this program that really can't afford it.

259
01:22:59,116 --> 01:23:01,280
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just want to point that out.

260
01:23:01,461 --> 01:23:04,627
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to turn it to Member Graham, then I'll turn it to Member Reinfeldt.

261
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:22,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, I just had a couple of questions 1st, the flyer that's on the back of the packet that we received shows like a 6 week run and it looks like the 1st week.

262
01:23:23,630 --> 01:23:27,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Sort of this is from 2023, so it looks like the 1st week is roughly like.

263
01:23:28,973 --> 01:23:31,614
[SPEAKER_05]: the week of 4th of July for a partial week.

264
01:23:31,734 --> 01:23:34,155
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it does end pretty abruptly in mid-August.

265
01:23:34,175 --> 01:23:37,496
[SPEAKER_05]: So can you tell us what the plans are for this year's dates?

266
01:23:40,297 --> 01:23:46,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so right now we're scheduled from June 30th, which is the Monday with having the 4th off.

267
01:23:46,060 --> 01:23:49,861
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I believe the Friday is either August 8th or August 9th.

268
01:23:49,941 --> 01:23:51,542
[SPEAKER_07]: I can just pull up on my calendar here.

269
01:23:51,562 --> 01:23:52,442
[SPEAKER_05]: The 8th is a Friday.

270
01:23:52,462 --> 01:23:52,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so the 8th.

271
01:23:55,051 --> 01:24:01,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so if I am thinking about, I know it's hard to figure out where school really ends, but.

272
01:24:01,874 --> 01:24:04,795
[SPEAKER_05]: That means there is the 1 week gap between.

273
01:24:06,896 --> 01:24:13,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe roughly a 1 week gap before the camp gets going and then there's actually.

274
01:24:14,797 --> 01:24:39,793
[SPEAKER_05]: um a two plus week gap in august um have we ever explored particularly covering those late weeks in august like that is a time when people really struggle for camps because camps wrap early so have we ever considered that those weeks just want me to take that dr cushing or

275
01:24:40,253 --> 01:24:52,019
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, and I mean, I actually broached this subject with Mr. Petrelis the other day, but there is another operational challenge is the Missittuck is a very utilized school over the summer.

276
01:24:52,099 --> 01:24:53,480
[SPEAKER_08]: We also have an EL camp.

277
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:56,381
[SPEAKER_08]: We have some of our summer special education programs there.

278
01:24:56,881 --> 01:25:07,987
[SPEAKER_08]: And so those two weeks are really critical, particularly at the Missittuck to try to get that building back into an operational readiness for academics come the start of school.

279
01:25:08,948 --> 01:25:15,476
[SPEAKER_08]: I also spoke with Mr. Petrellis about seeing if there was a way to extend on the front or on the backside.

280
01:25:16,137 --> 01:25:20,803
[SPEAKER_08]: And it does come an issue around staffing with students going back to college.

281
01:25:22,205 --> 01:25:26,110
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Petrellis himself, his assistant directors may also want a week here or there.

282
01:25:27,110 --> 01:25:28,111
[SPEAKER_08]: as he's an educator.

283
01:25:28,531 --> 01:25:31,593
[SPEAKER_08]: So it is something that Memogram that we'd really like to consider.

284
01:25:32,033 --> 01:25:34,175
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just trying to thread that needle and nuance.

285
01:25:35,395 --> 01:25:47,283
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say that given that two of our buildings will be offline this summer, the McGlynn and the Andrews for the HVAC work, that it should be something we explore not for this summer, but possibly the summer of 2026.

286
01:25:47,723 --> 01:25:51,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for that.

287
01:25:51,585 --> 01:25:55,588
[SPEAKER_05]: I was not thinking about the Andrews and the McGlynn being

288
01:25:56,767 --> 01:26:04,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Consumed, but I would like us to explore that for next year because I think particularly those late weeks are a problem.

289
01:26:07,059 --> 01:26:10,964
[SPEAKER_05]: I also would like to see a budget proposal for this year.

290
01:26:11,124 --> 01:26:14,808
[SPEAKER_05]: So that we can understand, like, I am all for.

291
01:26:16,838 --> 01:26:40,269
[SPEAKER_05]: the affordability of this camp but I would like to see a budget that says here's you know here's how many students we expect to have based on some set of assumptions which usually could lean on past performance here's what we anticipate the costs of the staffing that we need for that number of students to be and

292
01:26:41,850 --> 01:26:46,832
[SPEAKER_05]: yes, all of this works out and we're not operating in the red or in the black.

293
01:26:48,032 --> 01:27:06,680
[SPEAKER_05]: I would also love to explore a sliding scale tuition program, much like we do with the after school program, because our students have parents with wide varieties of an ability to

294
01:27:08,212 --> 01:27:08,832
[SPEAKER_05]: pay for camp.

295
01:27:08,992 --> 01:27:12,594
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are lots of kids who really love this camp, which is amazing.

296
01:27:12,614 --> 01:27:22,378
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we should be leaning more towards what we're doing with after school than setting sort of a blanket price.

297
01:27:23,238 --> 01:27:27,940
[SPEAKER_05]: And with after school, we look at some thresholds of financial assistance.

298
01:27:28,060 --> 01:27:34,143
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would love to see an analysis that says if the rate is this, we can

299
01:27:34,862 --> 01:27:41,269
[SPEAKER_05]: We can do we can do some sort of sliding scale that reduces the rate and makes it even more affordable for those families who need it.

300
01:27:42,530 --> 01:27:50,218
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that's a big ask, but I, I would like to see us do that and think about what is reasonable for us to do this year.

301
01:27:51,855 --> 01:27:59,759
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Anthony, your point about people having experienced a tax increase is well taken and that's important money.

302
01:27:59,779 --> 01:28:01,840
[SPEAKER_05]: There's important work that will come from that.

303
01:28:02,981 --> 01:28:11,546
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would like us not to impose the same kind of increase across the board if we can avoid that.

304
01:28:11,626 --> 01:28:16,948
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm hoping that we could do that for maybe the next meeting.

305
01:28:19,230 --> 01:28:20,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that possible?

306
01:28:20,110 --> 01:28:21,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you need me to make a motion?

307
01:28:26,249 --> 01:28:26,829
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that for me?

308
01:28:26,909 --> 01:28:27,350
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

309
01:28:27,370 --> 01:28:30,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that for Dr. Cushing and for you?

310
01:28:31,852 --> 01:28:34,754
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm assuming the finance office is going to need to be involved in that as well.

311
01:28:36,935 --> 01:28:37,055
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

312
01:28:37,095 --> 01:28:45,800
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, for me, I like, honestly, a lot of the finances when things get added up and so on, I'm not usually a part of it, you know, but I definitely can be in the process.

313
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:47,541
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I definitely want to be involved with it.

314
01:28:47,561 --> 01:28:49,762
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's not me trying to run away from it.

315
01:28:49,862 --> 01:28:53,184
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wouldn't even know where to begin, honestly, to like help out with that.

316
01:28:53,464 --> 01:28:59,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, and I think, I would think, Anthony, that the finance office would need your input on the assumptions, right?

317
01:28:59,326 --> 01:29:04,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Like what is the enrollment, like the date, that kind of data, like the supplies that you need, that kind of thing.

318
01:29:05,608 --> 01:29:19,893
[SPEAKER_05]: But the finance office should be able to put that analysis together and be able to show us what's possible and whether doing some sort of sliding scale model off based on what we do with afterschool would be

319
01:29:20,988 --> 01:29:22,290
[SPEAKER_05]: possible this year or not.

320
01:29:23,751 --> 01:29:26,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Cushing, is that feasible for our next meeting?

321
01:29:28,505 --> 01:29:29,646
[SPEAKER_08]: It could be.

322
01:29:29,826 --> 01:29:31,267
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not saying that it wouldn't be.

323
01:29:32,008 --> 01:29:40,955
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the things we were hoping was to at least increase the rate a certain amount so that we could open registration.

324
01:29:43,096 --> 01:29:49,221
[SPEAKER_08]: So one of the things, Summer Fund typically opens several weeks after other camps do.

325
01:29:49,861 --> 01:29:57,327
[SPEAKER_08]: So looking for the future, I'm not saying that what a two week delay might do, but looking for the future, I wanna really make sure that

326
01:29:58,107 --> 01:30:06,336
[SPEAKER_08]: We are providing this opportunity, having three kids now, I can say the summer camp race is literally a race.

327
01:30:09,159 --> 01:30:14,505
[SPEAKER_08]: And getting shut out is something I recently experienced for a week so I'm still trying to figure that one out.

328
01:30:15,526 --> 01:30:17,348
[SPEAKER_08]: But the reason why I mentioned that is.

329
01:30:19,295 --> 01:30:25,577
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanna make sure that our option is available essentially on January 1st when these other camps open moving forward.

330
01:30:25,657 --> 01:30:26,797
[SPEAKER_08]: We're obviously behind that.

331
01:30:27,237 --> 01:30:30,298
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't have a problem working with our finance team.

332
01:30:32,498 --> 01:30:33,118
[SPEAKER_08]: I apologize.

333
01:30:34,599 --> 01:30:42,161
[SPEAKER_08]: And working with Mr. Petrellis on this and so that we have a clearer sense of our finances, the personnel costs.

334
01:30:42,201 --> 01:30:43,681
[SPEAKER_08]: This is largely personnel costs.

335
01:30:44,161 --> 01:30:47,502
[SPEAKER_08]: We really don't take into consideration things like

336
01:30:48,340 --> 01:30:52,763
[SPEAKER_08]: the electrical use on the building, which is the primary for the summertime.

337
01:30:52,783 --> 01:30:57,327
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, we don't take into consideration various things along those lines.

338
01:30:57,767 --> 01:31:02,050
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, we do take into consideration, you know, additional custodial cleaning fees.

339
01:31:02,551 --> 01:31:06,614
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, there's a daily two hour, um, overtime that's connected with this.

340
01:31:06,674 --> 01:31:10,317
[SPEAKER_08]: So it can be cleaned after the fact based on how the summer shifts go.

341
01:31:10,337 --> 01:31:17,442
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so, uh, I can definitely do that, but we were looking to try to open registration this week.

342
01:31:18,348 --> 01:31:25,771
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and if a reduced rate and a sliding scale is something that people would like to see for the following summer, I fully respect and support that.

343
01:31:26,251 --> 01:31:30,033
[SPEAKER_08]: I also don't want the committee to feel rushed by any stretch of the imagination.

344
01:31:30,813 --> 01:31:38,136
[SPEAKER_05]: But, yeah, I mean, to your point, we should be reviewing this probably in the fall every year so that.

345
01:31:38,936 --> 01:31:41,357
[SPEAKER_05]: We can be 1 of the 1st options out of the gate.

346
01:31:41,777 --> 01:31:45,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and, um, I think it's.

347
01:31:45,980 --> 01:31:50,702
[SPEAKER_05]: may be reasonable for us right now to advertise what the dates will be.

348
01:31:53,423 --> 01:31:57,926
[SPEAKER_05]: And that registration is forthcoming once the rates are agreed to.

349
01:31:58,186 --> 01:32:07,130
[SPEAKER_05]: So I feel like if people know it's an option and that that's forthcoming, that's not going to change the game for people too much at this point.

350
01:32:07,190 --> 01:32:09,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Because all of those camps we're talking about, they're already out.

351
01:32:10,151 --> 01:32:10,671
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't think.

352
01:32:12,138 --> 01:32:20,060
[SPEAKER_05]: I think two weeks for a better pricing, for a better picture of pricing so that we're not charging too much or too little might make sense.

353
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:33,824
[SPEAKER_05]: And then my final question is this form, which was from 2023, says that you need to send checks and money orders to Medford Community Schools with this paper form.

354
01:32:34,144 --> 01:32:38,025
[SPEAKER_05]: Have we migrated this registration process to an online platform?

355
01:32:38,943 --> 01:32:40,764
[SPEAKER_08]: We're in the process of doing that myself.

356
01:32:41,105 --> 01:32:56,096
[SPEAKER_08]: And Mr. Pivicelli, our communications director, have been meeting with Final Sight on that for this and many other options so that parents don't have to stand in line.

357
01:32:57,557 --> 01:33:04,462
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the drivers for online payments through Final Sight is a program called BlueSnap.

358
01:33:05,263 --> 01:33:06,524
[SPEAKER_08]: And BlueSnap is then

359
01:33:08,465 --> 01:33:09,827
[SPEAKER_08]: where the money gets deposited.

360
01:33:10,768 --> 01:33:14,171
[SPEAKER_08]: And from my understanding, I need to connect with

361
01:33:16,051 --> 01:33:23,157
[SPEAKER_08]: the city hall finance team just to really make sure that where where funds go and how they're accessed.

362
01:33:24,518 --> 01:33:43,753
[SPEAKER_08]: So, that's just one of the things that's next on my plate to work on but making sure that we have credit card registration, online payments, or bank transfers, however it is, is really a critical thing for the district as we do these camps and other other things that come up for families because

363
01:33:44,473 --> 01:33:48,137
[SPEAKER_08]: check and money order is not how things operate in 2025.

364
01:33:49,338 --> 01:33:57,585
[SPEAKER_05]: So is it the plan that that will be available for this registration period or are you saying this will it will not be available for this registration period?

365
01:33:57,605 --> 01:33:59,767
[SPEAKER_08]: We're working on that for this registration period.

366
01:34:00,308 --> 01:34:00,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it.

367
01:34:02,170 --> 01:34:05,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay I appreciate that and I know it's a lot of work but I think

368
01:34:06,840 --> 01:34:10,821
[SPEAKER_05]: everyone will appreciate it once we need to sort it out.

369
01:34:10,841 --> 01:34:14,963
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be honest with you, that's like music to my ears because it is really stressful.

370
01:34:15,043 --> 01:34:19,165
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm dealing with a lot of checking cash and I feel like I'm running to the high school nonstop.

371
01:34:19,185 --> 01:34:20,885
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to hold on to anything.

372
01:34:22,346 --> 01:34:24,146
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be unbelievable, honestly.

373
01:34:25,207 --> 01:34:25,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

374
01:34:26,487 --> 01:34:28,368
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think we want our staff

375
01:34:29,554 --> 01:34:38,856
[SPEAKER_05]: responsible for like sort of large swaths of cash because there's all kinds of like cash control questions that come into play when those processes are in place.

376
01:34:38,916 --> 01:34:41,076
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we can make that happen, that would be great.

377
01:34:42,196 --> 01:34:55,659
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to make a motion to get an updated rate card and a program budget at the next meeting to specifically explore sliding scale of rates.

378
01:34:56,906 --> 01:35:03,492
[SPEAKER_05]: And hopefully my colleagues will weigh in and let me know what they think about that.

379
01:35:05,574 --> 01:35:05,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

380
01:35:05,855 --> 01:35:08,637
[SPEAKER_04]: And point of information, I think we do have a little time.

381
01:35:08,697 --> 01:35:18,667
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, as one who registers, Mr. Petrella, correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think application process usually opens till beginning of June, if I have that correct.

382
01:35:19,995 --> 01:35:26,478
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, the last couple of years I've been wanting to put it out because the issue is have is that we get a lot of at the end of the summer.

383
01:35:26,538 --> 01:35:28,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Man, we wish we knew about this place earlier.

384
01:35:28,599 --> 01:35:30,300
[SPEAKER_07]: We would have registered all summer long.

385
01:35:30,340 --> 01:35:39,184
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's something over the last couple of years I've been really trying to make an effort to change and get it out much earlier than we have been.

386
01:35:39,304 --> 01:35:44,347
[SPEAKER_07]: But in the past, yeah, it's been usually around like March, April, much later than most places.

387
01:35:46,207 --> 01:35:48,809
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so motions on the floor before we call a motion.

388
01:35:48,849 --> 01:35:49,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Reinfeldt.

389
01:35:52,275 --> 01:35:55,198
[SPEAKER_01]: I was also going to ask about financial aid or sliding scale.

390
01:35:55,258 --> 01:35:58,000
[SPEAKER_01]: So I support that as seeing that model.

391
01:35:59,041 --> 01:36:07,768
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would actually like to see more of a differential between the resident and Medford school staff rate.

392
01:36:10,470 --> 01:36:22,953
[SPEAKER_01]: And non-residents, the rec center program is 250, Power Kids is 315, and then I believe Six Acres is 850 for two weeks, which turns into 425 for one week.

393
01:36:23,033 --> 01:36:33,115
[SPEAKER_01]: And so looking at our numbers here, I think particularly for non-residents, we can definitely push that up.

394
01:36:34,311 --> 01:36:38,394
[SPEAKER_01]: when we want to be prioritizing the people in Medford and Medford schools.

395
01:36:38,674 --> 01:36:41,676
[SPEAKER_08]: If I may, we really were not trying to shock the system here.

396
01:36:41,956 --> 01:36:44,878
[SPEAKER_08]: We were trying to realize this has been static for a long time.

397
01:36:45,338 --> 01:36:57,947
[SPEAKER_08]: While there is a $20,000 delta of profit, if you consider increasing the directors' pay, maybe the assistant directors, throwing some of the things in, that $20,000 can evaporate very quickly.

398
01:36:58,587 --> 01:37:15,318
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's, that was really like the impetus to try to like look at this, not to not to take away affordability from the families in Medford, but just understanding that the margins are, I would say thin, if we want to invest in the program and invest in the personnel.

399
01:37:16,380 --> 01:37:22,441
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also just wanted to add, I think the CIT program is a fantastic addition, and I love that for our older students.

400
01:37:23,361 --> 01:37:28,242
[SPEAKER_01]: And I support having things be a little higher so that we can pay our students.

401
01:37:28,542 --> 01:37:29,903
[SPEAKER_01]: So finding that balance.

402
01:37:29,923 --> 01:37:37,064
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do think we can have a bigger delta between in Medford and out of Medford residents, although it sounds like.

403
01:37:37,524 --> 01:37:41,825
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that 10 students per week, or was that over the course of the whole summer?

404
01:37:42,325 --> 01:37:43,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Typically, just the summer.

405
01:37:43,525 --> 01:37:44,526
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, just over the summer.

406
01:37:44,546 --> 01:37:44,586
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

407
01:37:49,206 --> 01:37:51,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Ntopper has the floor.

408
01:37:51,068 --> 01:37:53,891
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I think these two had it.

409
01:37:54,031 --> 01:37:55,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I didn't see that side.

410
01:37:55,492 --> 01:37:56,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Who has it first?

411
01:37:57,154 --> 01:37:59,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Rousseau, then Member Olopade, then Member Ntopper?

412
01:37:59,576 --> 01:38:00,537
[SPEAKER_04]: No, then Member Bramley.

413
01:38:00,557 --> 01:38:01,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Then Member Bramley.

414
01:38:01,397 --> 01:38:01,778
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm last.

415
01:38:02,747 --> 01:38:03,508
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

416
01:38:03,808 --> 01:38:20,039
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that the finance department has been working on chargebacks for programs that operate in the school system, such as the food services program to cover administrative costs, HR, electricity, phone, gas.

417
01:38:21,420 --> 01:38:27,845
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would just hope that, I don't know if this program, it doesn't sound like this is already set up for this program, but it should be.

418
01:38:28,105 --> 01:38:29,206
[SPEAKER_00]: And unless there's something,

419
01:38:31,087 --> 01:38:48,721
[SPEAKER_00]: like philosophically different about it being part of community schools, but making sure that these activities that are operations that are happening that are outside of the school budget means that they shouldn't be negatively impacting the school budget, which is what happens when the utilities go up.

420
01:38:50,503 --> 01:38:53,485
[SPEAKER_00]: A minor issue, and I know that there's a bunch of these things that have been

421
01:38:54,317 --> 01:39:11,135
[SPEAKER_00]: worked on already and that it's an ongoing process, but I just hope we can get this one done too, but especially when we're talking about creating a budget, understanding the costs, that the costs should be the costs, not the costs minus everything we order and all this other stuff.

422
01:39:11,195 --> 01:39:11,935
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.

423
01:39:13,257 --> 01:39:14,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Member Lopate.

424
01:39:17,618 --> 01:39:18,038
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

425
01:39:18,619 --> 01:39:25,325
[SPEAKER_09]: So to go back to the conversation about registration and the process for that, is that a first come first serve and then there's a wait list?

426
01:39:25,385 --> 01:39:26,205
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it lottery system?

427
01:39:26,285 --> 01:39:29,008
[SPEAKER_09]: How does that kind of get dealt year to year?

428
01:39:29,028 --> 01:39:31,470
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it going to be changing potentially or is it going to remain the same?

429
01:39:33,232 --> 01:39:37,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Yeah, I was just gonna say I'm looking, I'm looking to keep that the same.

430
01:39:37,534 --> 01:39:42,295
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's the one thing that I really kind of pride in is I don't ever really want to turn families away.

431
01:39:42,315 --> 01:39:46,057
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's tough for families to find affordable, you know, childcare.

432
01:39:46,117 --> 01:39:50,398
[SPEAKER_07]: So we do really make every effort to accommodate as much as we can.

433
01:39:50,438 --> 01:39:51,659
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've never had a waitlist.

434
01:39:51,699 --> 01:39:53,159
[SPEAKER_07]: We've never really turned anybody away.

435
01:39:53,239 --> 01:39:55,340
[SPEAKER_07]: We, we just kind of adjust and adapt.

436
01:39:57,415 --> 01:40:06,426
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, and so I know you mentioned earlier, and to the point you just made when you have walk ins on the day of potentially your do you kind of plan for that or is it kind of a reaction.

437
01:40:06,866 --> 01:40:15,477
[SPEAKER_09]: Based off of just the need or do you kind of assume that there may or there may be let's say one to five additional youth that day just any given day, for example.

438
01:40:16,627 --> 01:40:23,751
[SPEAKER_07]: So as far as, you know, people come in, I mean, I, you were just talking about how like people walk in that day and kind of how we adapt to that.

439
01:40:23,791 --> 01:40:24,571
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that what you're saying?

440
01:40:24,591 --> 01:40:26,933
[SPEAKER_07]: Just want to make sure I understand you, right?

441
01:40:27,093 --> 01:40:27,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

442
01:40:27,933 --> 01:40:28,173
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

443
01:40:28,233 --> 01:40:28,353
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

444
01:40:28,373 --> 01:40:30,755
[SPEAKER_09]: 120, let's say that you already are anticipating day to day.

445
01:40:31,575 --> 01:40:36,698
[SPEAKER_07]: So a lot of times in the summer, I decide to hire a few extra councils anticipating that.

446
01:40:36,738 --> 01:40:40,180
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the difficulty with not having an online payment system sometimes is,

447
01:40:40,580 --> 01:40:55,218
[SPEAKER_07]: you might have a scale of people that are coming in based off of enrollment of you know mailing a check-in or coming in but some families also might come for two weeks decide that they really like it and want to sign up for additional weeks so sometimes that's how we also anticipate you know

448
01:40:56,484 --> 01:40:59,326
[SPEAKER_07]: anywhere between, like I said, 10 to 12 extra kids a week.

449
01:40:59,366 --> 01:41:01,708
[SPEAKER_07]: So I usually try to hire one to six ratio.

450
01:41:01,748 --> 01:41:05,491
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, one to two council is I usually assume to have on extra for a week.

451
01:41:05,971 --> 01:41:16,899
[SPEAKER_07]: And sometimes if our numbers are lower, I mean, a lot of times our councils go on vacations and that's a big thing that I take into account of people that are going away, um, and making sure that I do have enough staff to fulfill week to week.

452
01:41:16,939 --> 01:41:22,023
[SPEAKER_07]: So sometimes I will hire the extra for a lot of different reasons, but particularly anticipating walk-ins.

453
01:41:23,624 --> 01:41:23,904
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

454
01:41:24,004 --> 01:41:24,524
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much.

455
01:41:24,905 --> 01:41:25,245
[SPEAKER_07]: You're welcome.

456
01:41:29,250 --> 01:41:30,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Brantley, then Member Antapa.

457
01:41:31,731 --> 01:41:36,993
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just wondering, I was lucky enough not to have to do summer camps for my kids when they were little.

458
01:41:37,073 --> 01:41:40,895
[SPEAKER_06]: It was more fun versus necessity because I was home.

459
01:41:41,395 --> 01:41:47,578
[SPEAKER_06]: But do most summer programs have a sliding scale or is it just a set tuition?

460
01:41:49,999 --> 01:41:50,799
[SPEAKER_06]: Anybody know that?

461
01:41:50,899 --> 01:41:52,760
[SPEAKER_06]: I really don't know the answer, so I'm really asking.

462
01:41:53,780 --> 01:41:57,562
[SPEAKER_08]: In my experience, the summer camps my kids go to, they're nothing special.

463
01:41:58,314 --> 01:42:00,435
[SPEAKER_08]: are a set tuition now north of $500.

464
01:42:00,615 --> 01:42:02,575
[SPEAKER_08]: One includes food, one does not.

465
01:42:03,735 --> 01:42:04,556
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, okay.

466
01:42:04,836 --> 01:42:09,477
[SPEAKER_06]: And then just for Mr. Petrales, how old do you need to be a counselor?

467
01:42:10,797 --> 01:42:15,399
[SPEAKER_07]: So most of the time I hire counselors a year after they complete their freshman year.

468
01:42:15,519 --> 01:42:19,440
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's when I really will start looking into the youngest of counselors we hire.

469
01:42:19,460 --> 01:42:21,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you.

470
01:42:23,661 --> 01:42:24,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Ntapa.

471
01:42:27,394 --> 01:42:27,995
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, mayor.

472
01:42:28,075 --> 01:42:28,555
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

473
01:42:28,575 --> 01:42:45,111
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, yeah, I guess I just want to really support, um, voice my support of the thought of the sliding scale, the sliding scale option, as well as, um, director Petrelas mentioned the aspect of even bringing it from 275 to 250.

474
01:42:46,352 --> 01:42:50,876
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, because I would, you know, I'm echoing really with the mayor's comments earlier.

475
01:42:51,336 --> 01:42:55,800
[SPEAKER_10]: about affordability and making sure that we could sort of serve our community the best we can.

476
01:42:56,741 --> 01:43:09,452
[SPEAKER_10]: And also the words of Member Reinfeldt in terms of seeing more of a differential between the residential and method employee rate as well as the non-resident rate.

477
01:43:09,892 --> 01:43:19,000
[SPEAKER_10]: So I believe you said that we can't make an amendment on the floor in regards to this to vote on it, to make it down or to even talk about bringing it down to 250, but I would like to see

478
01:43:19,808 --> 01:43:24,151
[SPEAKER_10]: I would urge that decision to be made to at least bring it down to 250.

479
01:43:24,231 --> 01:43:24,872
[SPEAKER_10]: Excuse me.

480
01:43:24,912 --> 01:43:25,953
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what that is.

481
01:43:26,773 --> 01:43:37,001
[SPEAKER_10]: Um as opposed to the proposed 275 because if that, you know, we need to look at cost of living for our treasured employees as well as, you know, the director of Petralas as a educator within our system.

482
01:43:37,822 --> 01:43:45,948
[SPEAKER_10]: Um you know, making sure that we're able to continue to have staffing, comfortable staffing, as well as, you know,

483
01:43:50,038 --> 01:43:50,959
[SPEAKER_10]: I would hate to see it go up.

484
01:43:50,999 --> 01:43:57,363
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I would prefer to see it go up to, you know, 225 or 250 in that area as opposed to the proposed 275.

485
01:43:57,503 --> 01:43:59,224
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you.

486
01:44:00,365 --> 01:44:08,169
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe we can combine the two motions that we take another look at the pricing if it's a one rate for all and then explore a potential.

487
01:44:08,209 --> 01:44:13,373
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that it will be probably very tough administratively for sliding scale, but we can explore that while we're trying to

488
01:44:14,435 --> 01:44:24,139
[SPEAKER_04]: create a budget because we obviously need to bring in more money than we did last year if we want to give the appropriate raises to staff as should be if it's been since 2014-15.

489
01:44:27,690 --> 01:44:39,459
[SPEAKER_04]: So if that motion is clear the way I said it, and you can come back with a new proposal with a couple options or reasons why maybe one option or the other doesn't work for the next meeting.

490
01:44:39,479 --> 01:44:46,203
[SPEAKER_04]: So per member Graham amended by member Ntapa, is there a second?

491
01:44:47,785 --> 01:44:49,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Couldn't hear what member Ntapa was saying.

492
01:44:49,906 --> 01:44:52,328
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm unclear what amendment he was proposing.

493
01:44:53,565 --> 01:45:06,013
[SPEAKER_04]: He's requesting the administration go back and take a look at reducing the 275 to maybe 225 or 250, seeing how that works with the budget.

494
01:45:06,173 --> 01:45:09,535
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you're suggesting reviewing a sliding scale option.

495
01:45:10,136 --> 01:45:15,880
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe the administration takes both those things back, talks amongst themselves and what's feasible.

496
01:45:16,987 --> 01:45:31,592
[SPEAKER_04]: and also looks at a budget as it relates to what is needed with Mr. Petralz's help, because we want whatever option we do pick, we know we need to make more than we did the last year in order to give the appropriate raises that our staff deserve.

497
01:45:34,072 --> 01:45:44,956
[SPEAKER_05]: Is the amendment to, in addition to creating a budget and proposing rates that might include a sliding scale,

498
01:45:46,515 --> 01:46:00,018
[SPEAKER_05]: that the administration would look to keep the camp as affordable as possible, is that the amendment?

499
01:46:00,778 --> 01:46:03,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is the amendment to prescribe a rate?

500
01:46:04,519 --> 01:46:06,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I think that's a completely different thing.

501
01:46:09,260 --> 01:46:09,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Antapa.

502
01:46:12,496 --> 01:46:17,619
[SPEAKER_10]: If I can clarify, and sorry if I'm mumbling, I'm trying not to talk too loud so we don't get feedback issues like I normally do.

503
01:46:19,300 --> 01:46:19,780
[SPEAKER_10]: Like that.

504
01:46:20,280 --> 01:46:37,450
[SPEAKER_10]: No, the amendment is more to look at, if we cannot implement a sliding scale, it was more to look at trying to keep the rate as affordable as possible for the residents and employees of the Memphis public schools and to widen the margin between the non-resident

505
01:46:39,097 --> 01:46:42,498
[SPEAKER_10]: option that is implemented from trying to differentiate the two.

506
01:46:42,798 --> 01:46:44,338
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the specific phrasing?

507
01:46:45,138 --> 01:46:46,318
[SPEAKER_10]: Not resident, non-resident.

508
01:46:47,939 --> 01:47:01,381
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's to entertain both the option of a sliding scale to see if that will work or if the 225, 250 rate is more feasible.

509
01:47:01,421 --> 01:47:04,241
[SPEAKER_10]: It's to compare the two and to see what that'll do.

510
01:47:06,402 --> 01:47:06,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Russo?

511
01:47:10,278 --> 01:47:16,562
[SPEAKER_00]: When we talk about sliding scales, we always have to mean raising the top rate significantly.

512
01:47:16,803 --> 01:47:19,044
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you get the money for the sliding scale.

513
01:47:19,584 --> 01:47:24,047
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we want a sliding scale, the 275 has to go up, not down.

514
01:47:25,708 --> 01:47:32,152
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you can't have some people paying, if you want some people to pay $100, where does the money come from that?

515
01:47:32,232 --> 01:47:33,693
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes from the people paying more.

516
01:47:37,090 --> 01:47:41,232
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, a sliding scale will work fine if you increase the top rate for people that can afford it.

517
01:47:42,572 --> 01:47:49,815
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to keep it at $2.25 or $2.50, your sliding scale will be, OK, you can't afford it, so we're going to give you $5 off.

518
01:47:50,075 --> 01:47:51,636
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that doesn't really mean anything.

519
01:47:53,216 --> 01:47:54,797
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we do after school.

520
01:47:55,037 --> 01:47:57,218
[SPEAKER_00]: The sliding scale, there is a substantial

521
01:47:58,721 --> 01:48:00,082
[SPEAKER_00]: decrease in your rate.

522
01:48:01,282 --> 01:48:06,424
[SPEAKER_00]: But that means that people who can afford it are paying a lot more than if we didn't do sliding scales.

523
01:48:06,884 --> 01:48:07,465
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it works.

524
01:48:07,545 --> 01:48:11,026
[SPEAKER_00]: A sliding scale is a redistribution of the expense.

525
01:48:11,586 --> 01:48:15,128
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can't redistribute it unless we actually make somebody else pay more.

526
01:48:15,288 --> 01:48:21,930
[SPEAKER_00]: So this conversation about keeping the rates low and having a sliding scale, those are mutually exclusive.

527
01:48:23,271 --> 01:48:25,672
[SPEAKER_00]: So I personally don't think we should

528
01:48:25,988 --> 01:48:30,889
[SPEAKER_00]: put them together in one motion because I don't see the math working out.

529
01:48:30,989 --> 01:48:33,670
[SPEAKER_00]: We need X number of dollars to operate the program today.

530
01:48:34,190 --> 01:48:37,190
[SPEAKER_00]: We need more dollars to be able to give some folks a raise.

531
01:48:37,210 --> 01:48:40,011
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't had one in 11 years.

532
01:48:41,671 --> 01:48:43,652
[SPEAKER_00]: So the pot has to get bigger.

533
01:48:43,672 --> 01:48:49,193
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would happen if we just did a straightforward increase.

534
01:48:50,187 --> 01:48:53,689
[SPEAKER_00]: but we cannot also do sliding scales at the same time.

535
01:48:53,869 --> 01:48:56,671
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think going high is fine.

536
01:48:56,711 --> 01:48:59,392
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people for which they're gonna pick the program.

537
01:48:59,832 --> 01:49:07,697
[SPEAKER_00]: And just like we've had the conversation on afterschool, no matter what the rate is, they're gonna pay for it because frankly, options are rather slim.

538
01:49:07,977 --> 01:49:13,580
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you are in the income bracket where we're saying, no, you gotta pay the max.

539
01:49:14,701 --> 01:49:16,962
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you also happen to have all the options.

540
01:49:17,002 --> 01:49:18,743
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the most options and choices

541
01:49:19,943 --> 01:49:21,405
[SPEAKER_00]: of the people that live in our community.

542
01:49:21,485 --> 01:49:29,331
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think it's a big burden to expect that people who have plenty of income to pay more so that other folks can get in.

543
01:49:30,952 --> 01:49:36,697
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just think it's important we don't mix those two concepts together because they don't, the math doesn't work.

544
01:49:41,540 --> 01:49:42,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Braley.

545
01:49:46,462 --> 01:49:53,350
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I understand for afterschool, that's a way bigger system, so someone is working on that, but who's deciding the sliding scale here?

546
01:49:53,430 --> 01:49:54,672
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's putting the work in to do that?

547
01:49:54,692 --> 01:49:54,752
[SPEAKER_06]: You?

548
01:49:58,868 --> 01:50:02,369
[SPEAKER_06]: Mayor, you raised your hand, that's why I said you, in case someone didn't see that.

549
01:50:03,950 --> 01:50:11,452
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Petrellis, I'd work, I'd connect with Megan Fidley-Carrie to review her sliding scale so that we're not widely all over the place.

550
01:50:11,512 --> 01:50:17,894
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so wouldn't it just be easier to have this one price increase instead of trying to go low, trying to go high?

551
01:50:18,294 --> 01:50:18,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

552
01:50:18,634 --> 01:50:19,495
[SPEAKER_06]: We need a profit.

553
01:50:20,675 --> 01:50:21,455
[SPEAKER_06]: We've made it clear.

554
01:50:21,715 --> 01:50:26,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Petrellis is clearly working his heart and soul out here, definitely needs an increase

555
01:50:27,230 --> 01:50:27,690
[SPEAKER_06]: in pay.

556
01:50:28,231 --> 01:50:31,473
[SPEAKER_06]: So set it at one amount, we're already economical.

557
01:50:33,774 --> 01:50:48,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of information, if I may, that's why I shaped the resolution to be let the administration review the sliding scale, review a little bit lower of a rate than 275 per pupil, and come back to us and tell us what they feel should be

558
01:50:48,823 --> 01:50:53,866
[SPEAKER_04]: what they have time for, especially this year, to get this out in the next month or two for people to apply.

559
01:50:54,226 --> 01:51:04,253
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I shaped the resolution the way I did, so that you could vote on both, giving the administration the ability to come back to us with feedback and guidance and a recommendation.

560
01:51:04,973 --> 01:51:06,574
[SPEAKER_04]: So that depends on what this committee wants.

561
01:51:06,634 --> 01:51:07,595
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I would like to see.

562
01:51:07,615 --> 01:51:09,876
[SPEAKER_10]: That was the point I made.

563
01:51:10,957 --> 01:51:16,180
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not just me voting together, but to see which option is more feasible.

564
01:51:17,198 --> 01:51:18,799
[SPEAKER_06]: didn't they already do that when they put this together?

565
01:51:21,241 --> 01:51:21,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Galussi.

566
01:51:23,143 --> 01:51:23,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

567
01:51:23,763 --> 01:51:31,229
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that was going to be my clarifying point is just to make sure the sliding scale has already been created for afterschool.

568
01:51:31,829 --> 01:51:33,511
[SPEAKER_03]: This is so we would start there.

569
01:51:34,011 --> 01:51:38,514
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a little different because we're also talking nine hours of childcare.

570
01:51:38,935 --> 01:51:43,758
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have to go back to Dr. Cushing's point and we have to have conversations with our

571
01:51:44,719 --> 01:51:48,960
[SPEAKER_03]: staff, including Mr. Petrelis, and see what that looks like.

572
01:51:49,820 --> 01:52:05,283
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate the flexibility a little bit to gather that information as part of this resolution and then be able to come back with what we kind of found out to see what would be the best way to move forward.

573
01:52:10,304 --> 01:52:11,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham?

574
01:52:13,510 --> 01:52:13,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

575
01:52:14,711 --> 01:52:32,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I'm happy to, um, amend the resolution to ask the administrations, ask the administration to recommend a budget, which by the way, would include the rates that we're proposing to pay staff.

576
01:52:33,765 --> 01:52:41,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and the number of staff that, um, explores a sliding scale and

577
01:52:43,769 --> 01:52:48,771
[SPEAKER_05]: overall is looking to be an affordable program versus a profit generating program.

578
01:52:48,791 --> 01:53:00,295
[SPEAKER_05]: I think all of that can be accomplished, but you can't do that unless you go back and look at all the numbers, because the numbers on this page aren't enough to say,

579
01:53:01,235 --> 01:53:03,877
[SPEAKER_05]: that we're even making solvent decisions, right?

580
01:53:03,957 --> 01:53:06,800
[SPEAKER_05]: So we need a bigger picture view of that budget.

581
01:53:07,160 --> 01:53:20,210
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why I'm asking for this to be done next week so that the folks in the administration, which would not necessarily include Anthony, have the time to put this together and be thoughtful about it.

582
01:53:20,371 --> 01:53:21,391
[SPEAKER_05]: They have all the tools.

583
01:53:21,571 --> 01:53:25,835
[SPEAKER_05]: All of these tools exist within Medford Public Schools operations already.

584
01:53:30,483 --> 01:53:32,004
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're on the same page with that.

585
01:53:32,344 --> 01:53:41,471
[SPEAKER_04]: So motion for approval by member, as amended by member Graham, which took into account everybody's thoughts, seconded by member Ntapa.

[SPEAKER_00]: So I have been the shore representative of the Met for public schools represented for the shore board since my first term and.

611
01:54:37,020 --> 01:54:41,803
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the auditors just noted that we're actually every year supposed to be electing me.

612
01:54:43,224 --> 01:54:46,647
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently none of the other school committees do it either, but so I just figured we'd

613
01:54:47,521 --> 01:54:50,342
[SPEAKER_00]: cross the T's and dot the I's on that, so thank you.

[SPEAKER_04]: Handling of students whose parents, guardians have been detained or taken into custody.

666
01:59:14,350 --> 01:59:17,893
[SPEAKER_04]: If the district receives notification that parents, guardians of a student

667
01:59:18,294 --> 01:59:25,142
[SPEAKER_04]: have been detained or taken into custody by immigration law enforcement officials or agents, the district shall take the following steps.

668
01:59:26,002 --> 01:59:30,888
[SPEAKER_04]: One, contact the persons listed on the student's emergency card to inform the persons of the situation.

669
01:59:31,048 --> 01:59:32,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Ask if they can retrieve the student.

670
01:59:33,371 --> 01:59:36,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Two, make arrangements for school counselors to be available to support the student.

671
01:59:37,515 --> 01:59:39,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Three, contact the Department of Children and Families.

672
01:59:40,640 --> 01:59:45,603
[SPEAKER_04]: if parents, guardians have not authorized a responsible adult to receive the student.

673
01:59:46,143 --> 01:59:52,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Four, consult with the district's McKinney-Vento liaison if the student becomes unhoused due to their parent, guardian's detention.

674
01:59:52,386 --> 01:59:59,050
[SPEAKER_04]: I will turn it over to member Rousseau, member LaPadia, member Reinfeldt, if you'd like to speak on this.

675
01:59:59,410 --> 01:59:59,630
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

676
02:00:00,010 --> 02:00:00,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Rousseau?

677
02:00:01,011 --> 02:00:01,791
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.

678
02:00:04,278 --> 02:00:15,787
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, this is very timely and unlike most policies, which I spent weeks or months wordsmithing, this one was not, time wasn't on our side.

679
02:00:15,887 --> 02:00:20,511
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a couple of, I think the policy speaks for itself.

680
02:00:21,171 --> 02:00:25,475
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say that pretty much everything in here is how the district operated

681
02:00:26,175 --> 02:00:26,555
[SPEAKER_00]: already.

682
02:00:26,575 --> 02:00:28,856
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's an important point.

683
02:00:28,876 --> 02:00:38,381
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so districts that don't pass a policy like this, which, by the way, my understanding is there is, uh, Worcester Public Schools has this policy.

684
02:00:38,481 --> 02:00:45,044
[SPEAKER_00]: And as far as I can find, no other schools do, um, partially because it is just a statement of what is already the law.

685
02:00:45,424 --> 02:00:51,947
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, but I think sometimes saying things very explicitly in one place can be very helpful.

686
02:00:53,102 --> 02:00:58,324
[SPEAKER_00]: not to mention how it makes the community feel, which is, I think, an important point.

687
02:00:59,244 --> 02:01:03,966
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to, Dr. Cushing, do I have share privileges?

688
02:01:04,927 --> 02:01:07,307
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few amendments.

689
02:01:08,808 --> 02:01:11,909
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's just easier if I share it rather than.

690
02:01:11,929 --> 02:01:16,731
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, okay, thank you.

691
02:01:19,022 --> 02:01:19,842
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.

692
02:01:19,862 --> 02:01:20,263
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, great.

693
02:01:20,803 --> 02:01:42,145
[SPEAKER_00]: So the amendments, so number four under discrimination, harassment, and bullying, our attorney, the school district's attorney, did suggest that we remove this one, and I'm guessing, I didn't have a lot of time to talk to him, but the word unreasonable inquiries is a remarkably vague word.

694
02:01:42,345 --> 02:01:44,228
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that's a good.

695
02:01:44,288 --> 02:01:52,301
[SPEAKER_00]: Statement to even having a policy, so, um, I'll just list my amendments and then pick that we can hopefully vote for them all at once.

696
02:01:57,321 --> 02:02:01,104
[SPEAKER_00]: The other amendment is in number five in that section.

697
02:02:01,164 --> 02:02:06,008
[SPEAKER_00]: We did not have disability status, which just is an oversight.

698
02:02:07,889 --> 02:02:09,991
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not going to put that one in.

699
02:02:10,331 --> 02:02:11,872
[SPEAKER_00]: So those were my two amendments.

700
02:02:11,912 --> 02:02:17,817
[SPEAKER_00]: There is, I believe, another amendment coming from another member, but I will pause for now.

701
02:02:18,257 --> 02:02:19,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, member Russo.

702
02:02:19,058 --> 02:02:20,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Just repeat which one you're eliminating.

703
02:02:20,803 --> 02:02:36,886
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, so in the discrimination, harassment, and bullying number four, it's the district personnel will not make unreasonable inquiries of a student or his or her parents' guardians to expose the child's or his or her family's immigration status, which I can't imagine is something that actually happens.

704
02:02:38,046 --> 02:02:49,348
[SPEAKER_00]: But our attorney didn't like that one because of the words unreasonable inquiries, which in hindsight, I can understand that one.

705
02:02:50,224 --> 02:02:50,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

706
02:02:52,825 --> 02:02:54,585
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Reinfeld and then Member Intapa.

707
02:02:55,725 --> 02:02:57,746
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, I have another amendment to add.

708
02:02:57,846 --> 02:03:07,669
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to add in between the access to school premises and dismissal of students language about bus encounters.

709
02:03:07,729 --> 02:03:13,550
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the encounter involves school sponsored transportation, bus drivers and monitors shall take the following steps.

710
02:03:14,130 --> 02:03:16,591
[SPEAKER_01]: One, do not discharge students until instructed to do so.

711
02:03:17,171 --> 02:03:21,633
[SPEAKER_01]: Two, do not allow the agents onto the bus until instructed to do so.

712
02:03:22,173 --> 02:03:25,894
[SPEAKER_01]: Three, request identification from the agents and a copy of any judicial warrant.

713
02:03:26,435 --> 02:03:29,796
[SPEAKER_01]: Four, immediately contact the superintendent's office for further instructions.

714
02:03:30,396 --> 02:03:33,837
[SPEAKER_01]: And five, contact the transportation office to document the incident.

715
02:03:34,197 --> 02:03:36,798
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, this is the practice that is happening.

716
02:03:37,038 --> 02:03:46,642
[SPEAKER_01]: It mirrors the language of entry into school premises, but our student-provided transportation is an area that we also need to include in this, I think.

717
02:03:58,126 --> 02:03:59,987
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want this language to go?

718
02:04:02,369 --> 02:04:02,589
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

719
02:04:04,271 --> 02:04:04,611
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.

720
02:04:10,715 --> 02:04:11,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Ntapa.

721
02:04:13,377 --> 02:04:13,918
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mayor.

722
02:04:13,938 --> 02:04:24,425
[SPEAKER_10]: I think my only amendment is also just to make, under discrimination, harassment, and bullying, bullet points one and bullet point five

723
02:04:25,858 --> 02:04:45,216
[SPEAKER_10]: match up correctly because their bullet point one has some of the race, ethnicity, color, national origin, immigration status, but it doesn't include gender identity, religion, sexual orientation, disability status, just just to make the amendment is to make bullet point one and bullet point five more reflective of each other, and just to make sure that they

724
02:04:45,913 --> 02:04:51,800
[SPEAKER_10]: And then my other amendment was with number four, but since that is gone, there's no need for that amendment.

725
02:04:53,962 --> 02:05:00,769
[SPEAKER_10]: But other than that, at this moment in time, I don't see any other amendments on my plate.

726
02:05:01,430 --> 02:05:01,750
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

727
02:05:02,031 --> 02:05:04,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so is there a motion on the floor?

728
02:05:04,754 --> 02:05:05,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Olopade.

729
02:05:07,913 --> 02:05:10,317
[SPEAKER_04]: You can raise your hand up, I'll be listening.

730
02:05:10,818 --> 02:05:11,819
[SPEAKER_09]: Fair enough, yeah.

731
02:05:13,442 --> 02:05:15,205
[SPEAKER_04]: But thanks for your honesty in telling me who's first.

732
02:05:15,265 --> 02:05:16,827
[SPEAKER_04]: I really appreciate that at all.

733
02:05:17,829 --> 02:05:18,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Honest board.

734
02:05:19,924 --> 02:05:23,847
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think I just want to comment on what my other committee members mentioned.

735
02:05:23,907 --> 02:05:31,512
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's important to affirm, I think, the district's commitment, both vocally and visibly, how we approach these questions.

736
02:05:31,873 --> 02:05:35,835
[SPEAKER_09]: I think many of us are feeling the experiences of what's happening at the federal level.

737
02:05:36,235 --> 02:05:40,198
[SPEAKER_09]: We want to make sure that we are being proactive with the communication we are sending out to the district.

738
02:05:40,618 --> 02:05:48,704
[SPEAKER_09]: As mentioned before, many of these things are already happening, by and large, but I think having them in one place at one time is really important so that all

739
02:05:49,324 --> 02:05:57,508
[SPEAKER_09]: Members of the community, students, educators, families, and all participants feel like they're being affirmed in their discomfort and their comfort.

740
02:05:57,648 --> 02:06:00,229
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's really, I think it's both, unfortunately.

741
02:06:00,309 --> 02:06:04,611
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I just want to communicate that we are really trying to do the best we can, I think.

742
02:06:05,531 --> 02:06:09,252
[SPEAKER_09]: I want us to be cognizant of the fact that this is going to impact people differently.

743
02:06:09,672 --> 02:06:12,973
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this is an issue as empathetically as possible.

744
02:06:13,194 --> 02:06:17,075
[SPEAKER_09]: Some people are going to be experiencing differently and feeling more personally.

745
02:06:17,095 --> 02:06:30,499
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I think I want us to enter into this new year being as empathetic as possible to students and families, personal experience with the conversations that are happening at the federal level and how those will be trickling down to the state and the municipal level.

746
02:06:30,519 --> 02:06:34,020
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just want us all to be very cognizant of that as we move forward.

747
02:06:34,060 --> 02:06:34,660
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you.

748
02:06:36,535 --> 02:06:38,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, member Olopade, member Brantley.

749
02:06:42,058 --> 02:06:45,480
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is the first reading, so does the policy go into effect as soon as we vote?

750
02:06:46,760 --> 02:06:47,741
[SPEAKER_06]: How quick, how quick?

751
02:06:53,023 --> 02:06:54,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, she's laughing, uh oh.

752
02:06:54,674 --> 02:06:56,575
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, no.

753
02:06:56,756 --> 02:07:06,082
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think to the point that member Rousseau and member Olopade said, a lot of this we're already, we've already started doing and we're already continuing to do.

754
02:07:06,282 --> 02:07:14,568
[SPEAKER_03]: So in terms of at least what it looks like for the functioning of us behind, we are having ongoing conversations with principals.

755
02:07:14,588 --> 02:07:19,171
[SPEAKER_03]: We have another meeting tomorrow where Dr. Cushing and I are going to just make sure that like

756
02:07:20,582 --> 02:07:23,523
[SPEAKER_03]: part of the information in here, but like our communication plan is tight.

757
02:07:24,044 --> 02:07:32,428
[SPEAKER_03]: We're having a conversation with the bus company, um, per the amendment to, um, member, um, Reinfeld.

758
02:07:32,648 --> 02:07:36,030
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think those conversations are already happening.

759
02:07:36,610 --> 02:07:41,652
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think this is just making sure that we are solidifying, putting it all together.

760
02:07:41,713 --> 02:07:41,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

761
02:07:41,893 --> 02:07:42,253
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect.

762
02:07:42,293 --> 02:07:42,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Just want to make sure.

763
02:07:42,853 --> 02:07:43,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

764
02:07:43,613 --> 02:07:43,914
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

765
02:07:48,571 --> 02:07:48,871
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

766
02:07:49,071 --> 02:07:57,118
[SPEAKER_00]: And to specifically answer the question, once we have finished amending it, assuming we approve it, we can certainly waive the second reading.

767
02:07:57,218 --> 02:07:59,340
[SPEAKER_00]: That's in our rules that we're allowed to do that.

768
02:08:01,201 --> 02:08:07,206
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't really have it in our rules that it has to be an emergency, but frankly, if it did, this feels like this would be one.

769
02:08:07,346 --> 02:08:12,431
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will propose to waive the second reading until we've at least finished the first one.

770
02:08:12,451 --> 02:08:15,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

771
02:08:15,773 --> 02:08:16,474
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Reinfeld?

772
02:08:18,550 --> 02:08:28,838
[SPEAKER_01]: I will also say there is some significance to today being Holocaust Remembrance Day, and I would actually love to have this passed on this day.

773
02:08:28,858 --> 02:08:33,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so motion for approval, I take it.

774
02:08:34,162 --> 02:08:34,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Runfeld.

775
02:08:36,784 --> 02:08:40,286
[SPEAKER_04]: As amended, seconded by Member Olopade.

776
02:08:40,627 --> 02:08:41,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Roll call, please.

777
02:08:43,708 --> 02:08:44,888
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to speak on this.

778
02:08:46,389 --> 02:08:49,290
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do that before after we well, it should be before.

779
02:08:49,370 --> 02:08:59,393
[SPEAKER_04]: So if anybody would like to say a few words, or if you're happy, and you know where the votes go in either way, so please podium is yours.

780
02:08:59,753 --> 02:09:10,477
[SPEAKER_08]: Under number seven, we currently as a matter of practice, notify hate crimes to the city's civil rights officer, who happens to be Francis Nwaje.

781
02:09:12,024 --> 02:09:21,147
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be my friendly suggestion, that be it the civil rights officer as well as local law enforcement.

782
02:09:29,289 --> 02:09:32,510
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, I think nobody's online with their hand up.

783
02:09:32,550 --> 02:09:40,653
[SPEAKER_04]: So if there's no further comment, because everybody just want to be here for the discussion, I'll move the question.

784
02:09:42,511 --> 02:09:45,313
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to make a motion to waive the first reading of the policy.

785
02:09:45,333 --> 02:09:45,393
[SPEAKER_00]: Um.

786
02:09:45,413 --> 02:09:45,873
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Bramley.

787
02:09:46,633 --> 02:09:46,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

788
02:09:47,774 --> 02:09:48,274
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Graham.

789
02:09:48,294 --> 02:09:48,454
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

790
02:09:49,195 --> 02:09:49,635
[SPEAKER_00]: Member and Tapa.

791
02:09:49,655 --> 02:09:49,735
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_00]: Member Ola Pate.

793
02:09:50,356 --> 02:09:50,616
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

794
02:09:50,876 --> 02:09:51,496
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Reinfeldt.

795
02:09:51,516 --> 02:09:51,596
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

796
02:09:52,157 --> 02:09:52,477
[SPEAKER_00]: Never.

797
02:09:52,497 --> 02:09:53,317
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, Maryland.

798
02:09:53,377 --> 02:09:54,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay Yes, seven.

799
02:09:54,478 --> 02:09:55,859
[SPEAKER_04]: The affirmative zero in the negative.

800
02:09:56,039 --> 02:09:58,921
[SPEAKER_04]: The immigration enforcement policy has been approved.

801
02:09:59,481 --> 02:10:02,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor member first reading member herself.

802
02:10:14,566 --> 02:10:18,088
[SPEAKER_04]: get motion to waive the second reading by Member Russo, seconded by Member Branley.

803
02:10:18,248 --> 02:10:19,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, Member Graham.

804
02:10:20,629 --> 02:10:21,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Roll call, please.

805
02:10:24,670 --> 02:10:25,431
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Branley?

806
02:10:25,571 --> 02:10:25,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
