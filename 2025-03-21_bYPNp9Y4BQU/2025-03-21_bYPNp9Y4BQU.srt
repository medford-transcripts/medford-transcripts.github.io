1

19
00:00:46,537 --> 00:00:50,779
[SPEAKER_10]: 16-040 offered by Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

20
00:00:51,439 --> 00:01:08,085
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it resolved that the Chief of Police update the Medford City Council on how many citations slash tickets have been given in 2015 and 2016 with regards to vehicles illegally parking on sidewalks in the City of Medford.

21
00:01:08,746 --> 00:01:09,726
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam Vice President.

22
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,922
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

23
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:26,952
[SPEAKER_18]: I bring this up with regards to vehicles illegally parking on sidewalks in Medford because of a few complaints in a few different areas.

24
00:01:27,512 --> 00:01:39,483
[SPEAKER_18]: I know we as a council have spoken about this and we had pictures and we had maybe four or five people in the audience two months ago with regards to the problem that's happening on Main and Harvard.

25
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:49,306
[SPEAKER_18]: But I also have received complaints with regards to Winthrop Street and in one other street since that meeting aired.

26
00:01:50,386 --> 00:01:53,248
[SPEAKER_18]: We have a problem in the South Medford area.

27
00:01:53,268 --> 00:02:02,354
[SPEAKER_18]: The chief of police at the last traffic commission meeting, which was held back the first week in January.

28
00:02:02,774 --> 00:02:09,458
[SPEAKER_18]: No, maybe January 5th, I believe, stated to the audience and stated to us that we're in the audience

29
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:18,685
[SPEAKER_18]: enforcement was going to be picked up and that they were going to start, I believe, I'm not going to put words in anybody's mouth, but I came to think that more tickets were going to be issued.

30
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:37,196
[SPEAKER_18]: So not only are people parking there, large Mack trucks are pulling onto the sidewalk, completely blocking sidewalks, not allowing, I mean, you cannot go to a wheelchair or a stroller or even, you know, an adult and a child who need to walk side by side.

31
00:02:37,536 --> 00:02:39,117
[SPEAKER_18]: You can't traverse the sidewalk.

32
00:02:39,928 --> 00:02:47,550
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm getting complaints from five, six, seven, eight different people down in that area, and I know we all are, day after day.

33
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:57,773
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, I think I've gotten four emails from two different people today alone with pitches attached to the violators, and I just don't think it's right.

34
00:02:57,913 --> 00:03:03,095
[SPEAKER_18]: And so I'd like to see how many tickets were issued with regards to

35
00:03:04,619 --> 00:03:18,151
[SPEAKER_18]: vehicles parking on any sidewalk, not just that area, because I want to see, you know, I know I've seen it all over the city, and I want to see what enforcement has been done within 2015, and now come 2016, how many tickets have been issued.

36
00:03:19,492 --> 00:03:32,643
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe we could break it down to North Medford, South Medford, West Medford, so we can get an idea and a better picture on where the problems lie, and if we're enforcing at all.

37
00:03:33,622 --> 00:03:43,570
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd also like to amend this to just request from the mayor's office, you know, what stance the mayor's office has with regards to enforcement on sidewalks.

38
00:03:44,071 --> 00:03:58,782
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it had, you know, the chief of police is very nice and he was willing to listen, you know, him and the traffic commission were definitely willing to listen the beginning of January to the problems and the issues and the concerns, but I don't think enough is being done and I don't think

39
00:04:00,327 --> 00:04:16,392
[SPEAKER_18]: I really would hope that the administration from the top down would let people know that that's not acceptable, it's not right, and we need to figure out as a city how we can get these deliveries to our businesses that isn't going to impede on people's ability to traverse our sidewalks.

40
00:04:17,172 --> 00:04:29,716
[SPEAKER_18]: So I know that area sticks out at me specifically because I see pictures every day with regards to trucks and vehicles parking on those roads, blocking driveways, blocking the sidewalks.

41
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:52,929
[SPEAKER_18]: not only should they not be blocking sidewalks, but if a Mack truck is pulling up on a sidewalk where people, that's a busy area, that's a bus stop right near there, and people are walking and traversing those sidewalks all the time, I'd hate for a pedestrian to get hit while on a sidewalk by a Mack truck that accidentally didn't see somebody.

42
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:59,534
[SPEAKER_18]: You'd hate to see somebody heading to school, a young child heading to school,

43
00:05:00,537 --> 00:05:04,179
[SPEAKER_18]: have to come into the street because they can't use a sidewalk and get struck.

44
00:05:04,619 --> 00:05:05,840
[SPEAKER_18]: You see it in other cities.

45
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:06,901
[SPEAKER_18]: You see it on the news.

46
00:05:07,341 --> 00:05:08,721
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't want it to happen to Medford.

47
00:05:08,762 --> 00:05:15,765
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't want it to happen considering those emails are sent to every department head, almost every department head in the city.

48
00:05:16,146 --> 00:05:17,466
[SPEAKER_18]: They're sent to the chief of police.

49
00:05:17,726 --> 00:05:19,367
[SPEAKER_18]: They're now being sent to our new mayor.

50
00:05:19,727 --> 00:05:20,628
[SPEAKER_18]: It needs to stop.

51
00:05:20,768 --> 00:05:23,249
[SPEAKER_18]: We need to figure this out and we need to enforce it.

52
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:29,713
[SPEAKER_18]: I was adamant about enforcing it a month, two months ago when it came before the city council.

53
00:05:30,528 --> 00:05:35,773
[SPEAKER_18]: I, as one of probably three city councilors, I know Councilor Caraviello was at the traffic commission meeting.

54
00:05:36,234 --> 00:05:40,878
[SPEAKER_18]: We made the effort to go on a two o'clock, I think it was on a Tuesday.

55
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:49,346
[SPEAKER_18]: Us and residents took the time off of work to be there because it's an important issue and I don't feel like it was given the weight it should be.

56
00:05:49,366 --> 00:05:53,670
[SPEAKER_18]: I feel like almost we were appeased, we'll enforce, we'll enforce more.

57
00:05:53,971 --> 00:05:55,152
[SPEAKER_18]: I just feel like that's not enough.

58
00:05:56,227 --> 00:06:00,248
[SPEAKER_18]: So I really ask, number one, how many tickets have been issued?

59
00:06:00,268 --> 00:06:07,791
[SPEAKER_18]: Because if not many tickets have been issued in 2016, especially since when we told there were going to be, then we have a problem.

60
00:06:08,171 --> 00:06:17,694
[SPEAKER_18]: And I also want to amend it to see if the mayor of our city will step up, ask the chief of police to step up enforcement with regards to this particular issue.

61
00:06:17,714 --> 00:06:22,435
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion of Vice President Lungo-Koehn, as amended, Councilor Caraviello.

62
00:06:22,595 --> 00:06:23,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

63
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:24,796
[SPEAKER_05]: At that same meeting,

64
00:06:25,432 --> 00:06:30,136
[SPEAKER_05]: It was suggested that the republic parking do that also.

65
00:06:30,617 --> 00:06:33,980
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing that they're going around doing the other ticketing, why can't they ticket those cars too?

66
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:42,768
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was suggested that maybe I have another motion in regards to Park Method later this evening, but maybe it's time for Park Methodists to

67
00:06:43,296 --> 00:06:46,818
[SPEAKER_05]: to come in with us and step up there and see where they're going in the future.

68
00:06:46,838 --> 00:06:48,659
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll talk about that later in the evening.

69
00:06:49,339 --> 00:06:51,880
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, that was a suggestion for that D.N.

70
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:56,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Nash, go out and hire a couple more people, because you can't do a whole city with four people.

71
00:06:59,024 --> 00:06:59,804
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor.

72
00:07:00,945 --> 00:07:01,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening.

73
00:07:01,525 --> 00:07:03,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Please state your name and address for the record.

74
00:07:03,486 --> 00:07:05,327
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Nick Tomazook, 29 Garfield Ave.

75
00:07:05,507 --> 00:07:05,827
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome.

76
00:07:06,067 --> 00:07:06,768
[SPEAKER_06]: How you doing, guys?

77
00:07:07,968 --> 00:07:10,530
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just parking business.

78
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,161
[SPEAKER_06]: I walk my dogs every day.

79
00:07:13,181 --> 00:07:14,541
[SPEAKER_06]: I have two dogs.

80
00:07:15,322 --> 00:07:22,585
[SPEAKER_06]: And how many times I have to go out in the street because people park their cars in their driveway and block the sidewalk.

81
00:07:26,147 --> 00:07:26,847
[SPEAKER_06]: And no ticket.

82
00:07:28,768 --> 00:07:35,011
[SPEAKER_06]: You see unattached trailers just sitting on the roadways, no tickets.

83
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:39,553
[SPEAKER_06]: And those are commercial trailers.

84
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:44,017
[SPEAKER_06]: commercial cars parked in the streets, no tickets.

85
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:49,841
[SPEAKER_06]: I called the station and they told me that they're too busy to ticket.

86
00:07:51,662 --> 00:08:05,411
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know if you guys remember when I first spoke about parking, we were talking about getting retired people in the city to issue parking tickets instead of this monstrosity that we have.

87
00:08:06,811 --> 00:08:08,933
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is all revenue that the city's losing.

88
00:08:10,587 --> 00:08:11,767
[SPEAKER_06]: But we need to get after this.

89
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:23,252
[SPEAKER_06]: And to, not to get off the subject of the parking, but I'm talking, when you try to cross in a crosswalk and these cars, when they pull up to the red light, it seems like they forgot what a stop line is.

90
00:08:25,513 --> 00:08:28,394
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems like they have to get their car right into the crosswalk.

91
00:08:28,414 --> 00:08:29,715
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have to walk around them.

92
00:08:31,175 --> 00:08:32,856
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, nobody's getting ticketed in the city.

93
00:08:34,637 --> 00:08:37,178
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to get somebody, you know, to get after,

94
00:08:37,995 --> 00:08:57,227
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, whoever we have to, if we have to get another parking enforcement crew from the city and forget those other idiots and do our own thing and raise revenue for the city so we don't have to raise taxes or anything else, I'll volunteer to tax.

95
00:08:58,748 --> 00:09:00,829
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll bet you I'll write you a thousand tickets a week.

96
00:09:03,491 --> 00:09:07,253
[SPEAKER_06]: And a thousand tickets, even if it was five bucks each, do the math.

97
00:09:08,984 --> 00:09:10,045
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to do something.

98
00:09:10,085 --> 00:09:11,186
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's just getting rampant.

99
00:09:11,206 --> 00:09:16,629
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, they park on the sidewalk, they block the crosswalks, they block the sidewalks.

100
00:09:16,749 --> 00:09:19,551
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't care, because they know they're not going to get ticketed.

101
00:09:21,913 --> 00:09:26,636
[SPEAKER_06]: And this 48-hour business, I mean, we had a snowstorm last Saturday, right?

102
00:09:26,977 --> 00:09:33,161
[SPEAKER_06]: Drive down any given street in Medford, and I'll bet you find two or three cars that haven't moved yet.

103
00:09:34,982 --> 00:09:37,324
[SPEAKER_06]: They were waiting for the sun to melt the snow off their cars.

104
00:09:40,177 --> 00:09:41,618
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, that's all I have to say, folks.

105
00:09:42,038 --> 00:09:42,439
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

106
00:09:42,659 --> 00:09:43,199
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, sir.

107
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,462
[SPEAKER_10]: Chair recognizes Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

108
00:09:46,982 --> 00:10:07,577
[SPEAKER_18]: On that point, and thank you, President Dello Russo, I think if we left the people alone who are maybe paid for parking and are there for an extra five, ten minutes and instead worry about the actual serious violations within the city of Medford, we would have far less tickets to just the average person who maybe

109
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:21,704
[SPEAKER_18]: in the hairdresser an extra five or 10 minutes, and we'd have resolved to problems such as this with regards to people parking on the sidewalks, in handicapped spots that they don't have a handicap placard.

110
00:10:21,784 --> 00:10:30,227
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, there are so many other violations and things that could keep Republic Parking very busy, and enforcement, enforcement.

111
00:10:30,267 --> 00:10:33,568
[SPEAKER_18]: But the problem with that is it needs to come

112
00:10:34,887 --> 00:10:40,152
[SPEAKER_18]: Our department, our police department needs to get direction from the chief of police to be able to do that.

113
00:10:40,613 --> 00:10:44,376
[SPEAKER_18]: Or needs to, public parking needs to get direction from the chief of police.

114
00:10:44,797 --> 00:10:53,345
[SPEAKER_18]: And I strongly believe that our new mayor needs to put pressure on the chief of police to do this enforcement that's so desperately needed.

115
00:10:53,765 --> 00:10:54,606
[SPEAKER_18]: It needs to happen.

116
00:10:54,706 --> 00:10:57,068
[SPEAKER_18]: It's something that the old administration back in 2015 and prior to

117
00:10:59,478 --> 00:11:02,582
[SPEAKER_18]: did not put enough effort into at all.

118
00:11:02,942 --> 00:11:05,766
[SPEAKER_18]: We're known as the no enforcement city.

119
00:11:06,387 --> 00:11:09,351
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know of any other city that doesn't enforce the way we do.

120
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:14,217
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know of a ticket that has happened

121
00:11:14,821 --> 00:11:18,504
[SPEAKER_18]: I obviously never get complaints about tickets because we don't ticket.

122
00:11:19,044 --> 00:11:19,825
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't enforce.

123
00:11:20,185 --> 00:11:29,272
[SPEAKER_18]: If you go to Somerville, if you go to Malden, even if you go to Winchester and park for over an hour in a spot that's an hour parking, you're getting a ticket.

124
00:11:31,113 --> 00:11:42,662
[SPEAKER_18]: Republic is the only sense of enforcement that we have, and they're just getting the people that could be doing other things and ticketing for other good reasons and clearing up some of these problems that are persistent.

125
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:44,483
[SPEAKER_18]: And I know I sound frustrated, but I

126
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,993
[SPEAKER_18]: I went over the history on this, and it goes far back.

127
00:11:48,394 --> 00:11:59,224
[SPEAKER_18]: It goes back years at this point, and it's very frustrating, and it's very frustrating for all the people that can't traverse sidewalks and that live in these neighborhoods where it is a serious problem.

128
00:12:00,044 --> 00:12:01,526
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

129
00:12:02,266 --> 00:12:04,328
[SPEAKER_10]: The Chair now recognizes Councilor Knight.

130
00:12:04,869 --> 00:12:06,210
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

131
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,271
[SPEAKER_07]: I can certainly

132
00:12:07,744 --> 00:12:13,650
[SPEAKER_07]: understand the frustration of the residents down on the Main Street area, I can certainly understand the frustrations of Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

133
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:18,634
[SPEAKER_07]: However, I think it's very important to point out that if we want enforcement, we want enforcement across the board.

134
00:12:18,995 --> 00:12:24,240
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think we want our parking enforcement officers to pick and choose what they want to enforce and what they don't want to enforce.

135
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:30,666
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, although I understand where she's coming from, why are they ticketing someone who's 10 minutes over the meter and not ticketing the car that's on the sidewalk?

136
00:12:30,686 --> 00:12:32,768
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they both need to get a ticket because the ordinance is clear.

137
00:12:33,165 --> 00:12:35,607
[SPEAKER_07]: We've entered into a contract with Republic Parking.

138
00:12:35,647 --> 00:12:38,869
[SPEAKER_07]: Republic Parking has the responsibility to enforce the ordinances that are in place.

139
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:39,810
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not doing that.

140
00:12:40,451 --> 00:12:41,031
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not doing that.

141
00:12:41,071 --> 00:12:42,272
[SPEAKER_07]: We have some ordinances that are in place.

142
00:12:42,532 --> 00:12:44,594
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not being enforced, and they need to be enforced, Mr. President.

143
00:12:44,634 --> 00:12:45,655
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really an enforcement issue.

144
00:12:45,675 --> 00:12:46,816
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a legislative issue.

145
00:12:47,796 --> 00:12:54,001
[SPEAKER_07]: And I scratch my head every night thinking about ways of how we can prompt action, but it's really a function of the administration.

146
00:12:54,521 --> 00:12:58,985
[SPEAKER_07]: So I certainly do agree with Councilor Lungo that we need some directed enforcement down in the area.

147
00:12:59,511 --> 00:13:00,292
[SPEAKER_07]: We've all seen the pictures.

148
00:13:00,332 --> 00:13:01,152
[SPEAKER_07]: We've all heard the stories.

149
00:13:01,192 --> 00:13:03,854
[SPEAKER_07]: We've all voted in favor of directed enforcements down there, Mr. President.

150
00:13:03,894 --> 00:13:07,616
[SPEAKER_07]: So I can understand why the level of frustration is growing high.

151
00:13:08,436 --> 00:13:14,960
[SPEAKER_07]: However, I guess the question that I pose is whether or not they did 100 tickets or seven tickets, what's the end game?

152
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,361
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the solution at the end of the day?

153
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,522
[SPEAKER_07]: What are we going to do to ensure that this enforcement gets done?

154
00:13:18,883 --> 00:13:20,364
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's the question that I pose to the body.

155
00:13:21,744 --> 00:13:23,946
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we need to provide a solution, some sort of solution.

156
00:13:24,246 --> 00:13:25,066
[SPEAKER_07]: What is that solution?

157
00:13:25,306 --> 00:13:26,147
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, Mr. President.

158
00:13:26,287 --> 00:13:26,667
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

159
00:13:26,707 --> 00:13:27,548
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have all the answers.

160
00:13:28,161 --> 00:13:34,063
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that this body, based upon the seven people that are behind this reel, could certainly come up with several solutions and several recommendations, Mr. President.

161
00:13:34,383 --> 00:13:37,464
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'd request that our subcommittee on transportation meet to do that.

162
00:13:38,424 --> 00:13:39,285
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Consular.

163
00:13:39,745 --> 00:13:42,526
[SPEAKER_10]: The chair now recognizes the citizen at the podium.

164
00:13:42,926 --> 00:13:45,807
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening, welcome, and please state your name and address for the record.

165
00:13:46,203 --> 00:13:48,485
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening, Jace Balding, Mystic Valley Parkway.

166
00:13:49,325 --> 00:13:54,209
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to thank Councilor Lingo-Cohen for bringing this issue up.

167
00:13:54,869 --> 00:14:04,416
[SPEAKER_00]: It is something that is near and dear to the folks who have mobility impairments like myself and is throughout the city of Medford.

168
00:14:05,016 --> 00:14:13,863
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the issues with cars parking on the sidewalk is that if you have feet or the ability to use them,

169
00:14:14,823 --> 00:14:17,465
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hop off a sidewalk and go around the car.

170
00:14:18,205 --> 00:14:35,197
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are in a wheeled mobility device, whether that is a power chair like mine or a scooter of some sort, you then have to go backwards, sometimes several city blocks before you can find an accessible way to continue forward in your trip.

171
00:14:36,177 --> 00:14:42,522
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other issue is with people who use canes, like the one I'm holding in my hand, the long white cane.

172
00:14:43,803 --> 00:15:01,003
[SPEAKER_00]: I have caused, I have had personal injury because I've run into a vehicle in the past when I was ambulatory and when I am ambulatory these days, walking at the general human speed, when your cane

173
00:15:02,704 --> 00:15:20,030
[SPEAKER_00]: goes back and forth in front of a car, and it gets stuck right under the body of a car, and the handle jabs you right into the gut and leaves a series of bruises in your gut, that is just something that eventually can cause not only

174
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:24,673
[SPEAKER_00]: internal damage, but some serious frustration at drivers.

175
00:15:25,414 --> 00:15:36,704
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that this is both an issue for the citizens of Medford who drive and have vehicles to consider, is that as good citizens we're causing each other pain, and that's unnecessary.

176
00:15:37,405 --> 00:15:40,407
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, aside from what tickets are being issued,

177
00:15:41,248 --> 00:15:55,317
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, what can this body do to support the overall health and safety of all citizens, including those ones who travel the sidewalks and need as much accessibility as possible?

178
00:15:56,357 --> 00:15:56,718
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

179
00:15:56,938 --> 00:15:57,798
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

180
00:16:02,441 --> 00:16:02,961
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening.

181
00:16:03,001 --> 00:16:03,382
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome.

182
00:16:03,402 --> 00:16:05,043
[SPEAKER_10]: Please state your name and address for the record.

183
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:07,407
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez.

184
00:16:07,487 --> 00:16:08,928
[SPEAKER_01]: I live at 281 Park Street.

185
00:16:10,109 --> 00:16:19,878
[SPEAKER_01]: On my street is Hickey Park on one end and the Roberts School on the other end, which has approximately 600 children, most of which come from the Fellsway area to go to the school.

186
00:16:21,459 --> 00:16:27,905
[SPEAKER_01]: Next to Hickey Park, there is a parking platform that was built by the DPW approximately 10 years ago.

187
00:16:28,426 --> 00:16:33,470
[SPEAKER_01]: The curbstone was built at a slant in order to make it easier for the cars to drive onto the sidewalk.

188
00:16:34,723 --> 00:16:40,046
[SPEAKER_01]: Every day, a DPW worker who lives across the street comes home, parks his car on the sidewalk, and has lunch at home.

189
00:16:41,927 --> 00:16:49,810
[SPEAKER_01]: Every year, there are space savers on that parking lot, and if you walk too close with your dog or anything, they tell you to get away from their car and get off their parking lot.

190
00:16:51,071 --> 00:16:59,415
[SPEAKER_01]: I was yelled at this week for going too close as they were shoveling the snow into the path that I had asked Mayor McGlynn to build.

191
00:17:00,033 --> 00:17:02,095
[SPEAKER_01]: because there was no sidewalk on that side of the street.

192
00:17:02,495 --> 00:17:13,925
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the opposite side of the street, we have a handicapped person who parks blocking the other sidewalk, which was the only reason I was able to get the path built because I was initially told to walk on the other side of the street.

193
00:17:14,546 --> 00:17:16,307
[SPEAKER_01]: It took five years to have that path built.

194
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:18,609
[SPEAKER_01]: There are still cars parked on there.

195
00:17:18,649 --> 00:17:23,534
[SPEAKER_01]: They had to put a fence between the path and the parking platform because they were parking on the new path.

196
00:17:24,646 --> 00:17:28,849
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a serious issue and the city workers are doing it too.

197
00:17:28,909 --> 00:17:32,171
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go buy Eddie's pizza, the police cars are on the sidewalk.

198
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:37,654
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go buy nappies, there's a police car parked on the sidewalk.

199
00:17:38,295 --> 00:17:42,437
[SPEAKER_01]: And Republic doesn't go to my neighborhood because we don't have meters.

200
00:17:43,057 --> 00:17:44,899
[SPEAKER_01]: So Republic will not enforce this.

201
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:46,860
[SPEAKER_01]: The police will not enforce this.

202
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,262
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody told me they got a ticket for parking on the sidewalk.

203
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:54,637
[SPEAKER_01]: but they were able to get it turned around because it's a recognized parking platform.

204
00:17:54,697 --> 00:17:57,138
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something that you need to look at.

205
00:17:57,218 --> 00:18:01,320
[SPEAKER_01]: A beautiful sidewalk was built and is now a parking lot for city residents.

206
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:03,380
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

207
00:18:03,921 --> 00:18:04,861
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

208
00:18:05,241 --> 00:18:05,801
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening.

209
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:07,682
[SPEAKER_10]: Please state your name and address for the record.

210
00:18:10,243 --> 00:18:12,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, Rachel Tannenhaus, 26 Pearl Street.

211
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:19,620
[SPEAKER_02]: I also have a block full of people who park on my street.

212
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,261
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a very long street, so you only get a block of people.

213
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:23,782
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure if it were longer, there'd be more.

214
00:18:25,342 --> 00:18:27,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Many of them live there.

215
00:18:27,122 --> 00:18:29,703
[SPEAKER_02]: They often park right in front of my gate.

216
00:18:30,463 --> 00:18:40,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me tell you how pretty it isn't when a blind person walks out their gate, and there's a car right there, and there's no room to, you know, I mean, this dog can only do so much.

217
00:18:40,046 --> 00:18:42,967
[SPEAKER_02]: He can't transcend space and time.

218
00:18:44,161 --> 00:18:53,965
[SPEAKER_02]: If there is a car right there in front of my gate, it means I can't get out without injuring myself and injuring the car, which I have to tell you I feel slightly less bad about.

219
00:18:56,346 --> 00:19:02,368
[SPEAKER_02]: During the 13 months between guide dogs, that I had between guide dogs when I was using a cane,

220
00:19:02,907 --> 00:19:04,328
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a very long 13 months.

221
00:19:06,029 --> 00:19:14,735
[SPEAKER_02]: I also had that issue where I would walk out and as Jay said, the cane would get caught under the car and of course I'd be right there.

222
00:19:14,935 --> 00:19:22,120
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have, I got to tell you when there was a car parked on the sidewalk, if I am using the cane for one reason or another, like when I take him to the groomers, he goes a lot.

223
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,461
[SPEAKER_02]: So that actually happens more often than you'd think.

224
00:19:25,702 --> 00:19:28,724
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no problem smacking the car with my cane because

225
00:19:29,295 --> 00:19:31,877
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an obstacle, and that's what the cane is for.

226
00:19:32,637 --> 00:19:38,161
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have to tell you that all up and down my street, and on trash day, forget it.

227
00:19:38,601 --> 00:19:43,724
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no way to get up and down the street because the trash barrels are out there, and people have parked on the sidewalk.

228
00:19:44,205 --> 00:19:51,529
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, sometimes there are people parking on the sidewalk such you can't find a place to put your trash barrel, which is less of an issue, but still annoying.

229
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:57,573
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have to say, it impacts my ability to travel safely.

230
00:19:57,593 --> 00:19:59,935
[SPEAKER_02]: I also often have to go out in the street.

231
00:20:01,276 --> 00:20:06,239
[SPEAKER_02]: This is particularly the case in the winter when you have limited amounts of sidewalk you can use anyway.

232
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:08,821
[SPEAKER_02]: People do shovel, but I mean, ice happens.

233
00:20:10,662 --> 00:20:12,904
[SPEAKER_02]: And OK, people sometimes shovel.

234
00:20:14,205 --> 00:20:21,090
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do want to say that it's not, like Cheryl said, it's not just where the meters are.

235
00:20:21,783 --> 00:20:25,366
[SPEAKER_02]: It's absolutely in the residential areas that don't necessarily have meters.

236
00:20:25,426 --> 00:20:28,809
[SPEAKER_02]: People are just parking there because that's where they figure their parking space is.

237
00:20:30,331 --> 00:20:31,772
[SPEAKER_02]: And it happens all the time.

238
00:20:32,413 --> 00:20:43,303
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have to say, like, if they don't feel like really enforcing it, but it is against the law, I certainly think it'd be interesting to see how many tickets have been issued on that.

239
00:20:43,323 --> 00:20:46,966
[SPEAKER_02]: But the report I would really like to see from the police, if you could request that,

240
00:20:47,468 --> 00:20:57,091
[SPEAKER_02]: would be the list of things that are illegal that they don't really feel like enforcing right now, because that would be a really interesting list, and I bet a lot of people would benefit greatly from it.

241
00:20:58,812 --> 00:20:59,852
[SPEAKER_02]: So, thanks very much.

242
00:21:02,133 --> 00:21:02,573
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

243
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:03,314
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening.

244
00:21:03,414 --> 00:21:05,294
[SPEAKER_10]: Please state your name and address for the record.

245
00:21:06,395 --> 00:21:08,856
[SPEAKER_12]: Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Avenue, Medford, Mass.

246
00:21:09,296 --> 00:21:10,616
[SPEAKER_12]: I second what Rachel said.

247
00:21:10,816 --> 00:21:11,937
[SPEAKER_12]: She's right on the money there.

248
00:21:12,597 --> 00:21:15,298
[SPEAKER_12]: What's the list of the items

249
00:21:16,932 --> 00:21:19,313
[SPEAKER_12]: that people violate that we don't even know about.

250
00:21:19,733 --> 00:21:34,877
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, June 13, 2015, if you go to my blog, MedfordInformationCentral.com, you will see a Republic parking guy right on the sidewalk, impeding public safety, while there's a woman's car in the bus stop.

251
00:21:35,077 --> 00:21:39,198
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the transit police were there from the MBTA.

252
00:21:39,218 --> 00:21:45,000
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know why, but they were there, and the woman was illegally parked, and there's Republic parking on the sidewalk.

253
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:45,600
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm sitting there.

254
00:21:46,182 --> 00:21:48,643
[SPEAKER_12]: in my window doing my work, and I look out and it's like, wow.

255
00:21:50,124 --> 00:21:56,768
[SPEAKER_12]: The crosswalk on Salem Street, right off from Garfield, always a car on the crosswalk.

256
00:21:56,888 --> 00:21:57,128
[SPEAKER_12]: Why?

257
00:21:57,609 --> 00:22:08,095
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, when I go over to the grocery store there and there's a car there, it's very dangerous because, as Council President even agreed with me, it's a speedway.

258
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:18,488
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a speedway to Malden and Revere because they get off the highway and it's easier than going down 16, which is like a dozen to two dozen lights.

259
00:22:18,688 --> 00:22:22,833
[SPEAKER_12]: So they all love to go down Salem Street and shoot to Revere.

260
00:22:24,027 --> 00:22:25,507
[SPEAKER_12]: by going through Malden, and they speed.

261
00:22:25,748 --> 00:22:26,328
[SPEAKER_12]: They speed.

262
00:22:26,368 --> 00:22:28,929
[SPEAKER_12]: It's 20 miles an hour, and it's unbelievable.

263
00:22:28,969 --> 00:22:36,231
[SPEAKER_12]: The cars that zip by me while I'm in the crosswalk, while I'm in, and they have attitude.

264
00:22:36,591 --> 00:22:38,592
[SPEAKER_12]: They think, we don't have to follow the rules.

265
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:40,312
[SPEAKER_12]: We want to get where we're going.

266
00:22:40,432 --> 00:22:42,593
[SPEAKER_12]: And they, it's not only me.

267
00:22:43,253 --> 00:22:44,493
[SPEAKER_12]: I've said this before at the council.

268
00:22:44,513 --> 00:22:46,154
[SPEAKER_12]: There was a guy laying flat out on the street.

269
00:22:46,254 --> 00:22:47,254
[SPEAKER_12]: God knows what happened to him.

270
00:22:48,615 --> 00:22:50,175
[SPEAKER_12]: There've been car accidents out there.

271
00:22:50,895 --> 00:22:52,996
[SPEAKER_12]: All the time I've lived here, and I watch from that window,

272
00:22:53,457 --> 00:22:55,238
[SPEAKER_12]: You cannot believe the craziness.

273
00:22:55,258 --> 00:22:57,339
[SPEAKER_12]: So why aren't we enforcing this stuff?

274
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,782
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, yesterday was the first time in my life I paid for parking in Medford.

275
00:23:02,242 --> 00:23:08,286
[SPEAKER_12]: I paid 25 cents at Citizens Bank in Haines Square because we had to go to the hardware store, and the Malden hardware store.

276
00:23:08,366 --> 00:23:10,747
[SPEAKER_12]: I avoid the city, and I love the stores here.

277
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:14,690
[SPEAKER_12]: I walked to Mystic Coffee Roasters this morning because my car was in the shop.

278
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:17,912
[SPEAKER_12]: So I will walk, but I will not pay the bounty hunters.

279
00:23:19,535 --> 00:23:21,716
[SPEAKER_12]: This is just a little information for this city council.

280
00:23:21,876 --> 00:23:22,637
[SPEAKER_12]: Now you have the problem.

281
00:23:22,697 --> 00:23:23,377
[SPEAKER_12]: It's in your lap.

282
00:23:23,697 --> 00:23:24,057
[SPEAKER_12]: Good luck.

283
00:23:24,077 --> 00:23:28,800
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening.

284
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,401
[SPEAKER_10]: Please state your name and address for the record.

285
00:23:30,441 --> 00:23:31,021
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome, Jean.

286
00:23:31,321 --> 00:23:31,641
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

287
00:23:31,782 --> 00:23:33,002
[SPEAKER_15]: Jean Martin, 10 Cummings Street.

288
00:23:33,182 --> 00:23:41,006
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'd just like to say that the issue of sidewalks is going to get worse because we have had so much development and we have more cars on the street than ever before.

289
00:23:41,347 --> 00:23:43,188
[SPEAKER_15]: And we have more people on the street.

290
00:23:43,648 --> 00:23:45,409
[SPEAKER_15]: But as far as enforcement goes,

291
00:23:48,064 --> 00:23:57,035
[SPEAKER_15]: The person that's in charge of the ticketing and oversight is Diane McLeod, whose job is the multicultural person, and her job is to be nice.

292
00:23:57,736 --> 00:24:03,463
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know why she has the job of being the judge of the tickets, because basically her job is to mediate between

293
00:24:04,172 --> 00:24:05,132
[SPEAKER_15]: constituency groups.

294
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:06,693
[SPEAKER_15]: So I don't understand.

295
00:24:06,713 --> 00:24:09,414
[SPEAKER_15]: It should be under the law enforcement agency of the city.

296
00:24:09,894 --> 00:24:12,274
[SPEAKER_15]: It should be under the chief of police.

297
00:24:12,795 --> 00:24:17,636
[SPEAKER_15]: It should be under his direction and he should be cracking down on enforcement issues.

298
00:24:18,036 --> 00:24:26,559
[SPEAKER_15]: But the reason why he doesn't is because it causes a lot of inner fighting and a lot of grief and people will come up because they're not used to being told what to do.

299
00:24:27,219 --> 00:24:31,540
[SPEAKER_15]: They're not used to being told that they can't park in a certain spot and it causes a lot of grief.

300
00:24:32,128 --> 00:24:33,129
[SPEAKER_15]: and a lot of aggravation.

301
00:24:33,289 --> 00:24:34,489
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's why it's not being enforced.

302
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:37,551
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just want to say that it's going to have to change.

303
00:24:38,412 --> 00:24:40,933
[SPEAKER_15]: Otherwise, you're going to have people in the streets getting hurt.

304
00:24:41,774 --> 00:24:42,294
[SPEAKER_15]: You really are.

305
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,935
[SPEAKER_15]: You're going to have people in the streets.

306
00:24:44,275 --> 00:24:45,616
[SPEAKER_15]: And wait until the competition.

307
00:24:45,676 --> 00:24:50,939
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm glad that those ladies spoke from the disability community, because it's called a sidewalk.

308
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:52,640
[SPEAKER_15]: Walk.

309
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:53,781
[SPEAKER_15]: A sidewalk.

310
00:24:54,341 --> 00:24:56,922
[SPEAKER_15]: So unfortunately, they can't walk, so they need to wheel.

311
00:24:57,423 --> 00:25:01,145
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's designed for strollers and people and

312
00:25:01,578 --> 00:25:02,999
[SPEAKER_15]: First of all, wheelchairs.

313
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:07,520
[SPEAKER_15]: And if a wheelchair can't get through a spot, then you need to take the tree out or whatever it is.

314
00:25:08,081 --> 00:25:12,022
[SPEAKER_15]: Trees come second to people walking on the sidewalks, because it's called a sidewalk.

315
00:25:12,763 --> 00:25:13,363
[SPEAKER_15]: I like trees.

316
00:25:13,763 --> 00:25:14,503
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm all for trees.

317
00:25:14,563 --> 00:25:18,445
[SPEAKER_15]: If you can put a tree and fit a tree, and you can fit a wheelchair, all the more power to you.

318
00:25:19,085 --> 00:25:21,566
[SPEAKER_15]: But if you can't, then the tree comes second to the people.

319
00:25:21,946 --> 00:25:22,266
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

320
00:25:22,747 --> 00:25:23,347
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Chief.

321
00:25:25,888 --> 00:25:28,149
[SPEAKER_10]: The Chair now recognizes Councilor Falco.

322
00:25:28,649 --> 00:25:29,569
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

323
00:25:31,686 --> 00:25:35,107
[SPEAKER_16]: a really bad public safety issue that needs to be addressed sooner than later.

324
00:25:36,308 --> 00:25:42,411
[SPEAKER_16]: As I walk through the city, I walk to the bus every day, and I do see this, and it's alarming.

325
00:25:42,451 --> 00:25:48,693
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, you know, I think when you go for your permit and you learn to drive and whatnot, you always learn you shouldn't have your car on the sidewalk.

326
00:25:49,413 --> 00:25:54,295
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, in some neighborhoods, and we've all received pictures, you're seeing four, all four wheels on the sidewalk.

327
00:25:54,335 --> 00:25:55,156
[SPEAKER_16]: It makes no sense.

328
00:25:55,736 --> 00:26:00,238
[SPEAKER_16]: These, you know, the police department needs to, you know, enforce these laws.

329
00:26:01,044 --> 00:26:02,544
[SPEAKER_16]: and give out tickets for this.

330
00:26:02,725 --> 00:26:09,827
[SPEAKER_16]: And if I may comment on one of the points that one of the residents brought up earlier is down on Park Street.

331
00:26:10,627 --> 00:26:12,648
[SPEAKER_16]: When I walked down to the fellows way, I see it.

332
00:26:13,468 --> 00:26:18,069
[SPEAKER_16]: There is a section of the sidewalk next to Yankee Park that has a slanted curb.

333
00:26:18,789 --> 00:26:22,991
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's definitely something I think that needs to be addressed or looked into.

334
00:26:23,051 --> 00:26:27,632
[SPEAKER_16]: If we could, if I could amend the resolution to have the police chief report back to us

335
00:26:28,242 --> 00:26:38,328
[SPEAKER_16]: of whether or not this is a legal parking platform, because everyone has full, all four wheels of the car, of each car, they're all on the sidewalk.

336
00:26:38,928 --> 00:26:44,231
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'd like to know, I mean, is this a legal parking platform or is it not, and why isn't it being enforced?

337
00:26:44,911 --> 00:26:57,598
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, people are being forced out into the street, it's near a school, there are kids walking to school, a lot of kids take the bus, but there are kids in that neighborhood that do walk to school, and this is a public safety issue that needs to be addressed,

338
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,471
[SPEAKER_16]: needs to be addressed sooner than later.

339
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:01,793
[SPEAKER_16]: We're in the middle of the winter, it's starting to snow.

340
00:27:02,313 --> 00:27:10,779
[SPEAKER_16]: And so if I could amend the resolution to reflect that inquiry regarding the parking platform, greatly appreciate it.

341
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:11,079
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

342
00:27:11,219 --> 00:27:11,599
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

343
00:27:11,699 --> 00:27:21,646
[SPEAKER_10]: So on the motion by Vice President Lungo-Koehn as amended by the same and by Councilor Falco, the chair now recognizes Councilor Marks.

344
00:27:22,567 --> 00:27:23,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

345
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:25,509
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank Councilor Lungo-Koehn for bringing this up.

346
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:31,621
[SPEAKER_04]: This issue raises its ugly head every year, and it's been like this for years.

347
00:27:32,441 --> 00:27:35,183
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of the residents, I think, brought up a valid point.

348
00:27:35,883 --> 00:27:46,528
[SPEAKER_04]: When we brought on Republic Parking, their responsibility was for the meated areas in the business districts and also for any area that has resident permit parking.

349
00:27:47,028 --> 00:27:52,331
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are hundreds of other streets in the city throughout all the different neighborhoods that

350
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:56,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Republic parking is not going into those areas to do enforcement.

351
00:27:56,607 --> 00:27:58,328
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're not under contract to do so.

352
00:27:59,248 --> 00:28:01,230
[SPEAKER_04]: It's up to the police department to get out there.

353
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:10,035
[SPEAKER_04]: And for years, I've spoken about traffic calming approaches and ways to take back our city streets from people speeding and so forth.

354
00:28:10,456 --> 00:28:15,779
[SPEAKER_04]: And now it seems like we have to discuss taking back our sidewalks because you're right.

355
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:19,882
[SPEAKER_04]: It's becoming an epidemic in this city with people parking on sidewalks.

356
00:28:20,244 --> 00:28:34,851
[SPEAKER_04]: people not respecting handicap ramps, crosswalks, parking in front of crosswalks, parking too close to an intersection so a fire truck or an ambulance can't make it down your street, parking too close to an apron of a driveway.

357
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:41,874
[SPEAKER_04]: The city ordinance is that I believe it's two feet from a driveway that on either side that you can't park.

358
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:44,876
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's never enforced in this community.

359
00:28:45,316 --> 00:28:49,818
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it's long overdue, Mr. President, that the Traffic Division

360
00:28:50,285 --> 00:28:58,630
[SPEAKER_04]: coupled with the chief of police, sit down and have, I've asked for a public safety summit year after year after year under the old administration.

361
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:07,655
[SPEAKER_04]: And apparently when pedestrians are struck and killed on our roads, which has happened when this is not something that we're saying, God forbid something happens in the city.

362
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:10,617
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a woman struck and killed in front of St.

363
00:29:10,657 --> 00:29:11,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Joseph's not too long ago.

364
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:17,341
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are the things that are happening in our community right now.

365
00:29:17,794 --> 00:29:20,896
[SPEAKER_04]: So, it's not like, well, if we don't do something, something's going to happen.

366
00:29:21,196 --> 00:29:22,317
[SPEAKER_04]: It's currently happening.

367
00:29:22,557 --> 00:29:26,860
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had a number of pedestrian fatalities over the years in our community.

368
00:29:27,421 --> 00:29:32,484
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, some of it is for the fact that we do very little enforcement.

369
00:29:32,785 --> 00:29:36,948
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking about parking enforcement now, moving violations, Mr. President.

370
00:29:37,828 --> 00:29:44,833
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a spotlight, I think it was Channel 4 or Channel 5, did a spotlight about a year ago, and they listed 15 different communities.

371
00:29:45,213 --> 00:29:47,435
[SPEAKER_04]: And Method was the very last community

372
00:29:47,775 --> 00:29:52,518
[SPEAKER_04]: on the number of moving violations issued out of all the surrounding communities.

373
00:29:53,699 --> 00:29:56,000
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and some people might say, great, I won't get it.

374
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,982
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have to worry about getting a speeding ticket in Method.

375
00:29:58,302 --> 00:29:59,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Or when I go to a stop sign, I don't have to worry.

376
00:30:00,383 --> 00:30:01,524
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's not the case.

377
00:30:01,584 --> 00:30:04,486
[SPEAKER_04]: The case is pedestrian safety has to come first.

378
00:30:04,866 --> 00:30:07,408
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to take back our streets, Mr. President.

379
00:30:08,028 --> 00:30:11,750
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just one aspect of enforcement that needs to be done.

380
00:30:12,331 --> 00:30:15,793
[SPEAKER_04]: When you see a street that doesn't take the time to paint their crosswalks,

381
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:21,971
[SPEAKER_04]: That sends a loud message to people that, you know what, pedestrian safety doesn't matter in our community.

382
00:30:22,392 --> 00:30:24,732
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't matter that the crosswalks go unpainted.

383
00:30:25,072 --> 00:30:30,373
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't matter that there's no proper signage to indicate that there's a crosswalk in a particular area.

384
00:30:30,674 --> 00:30:38,676
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we had, the mayor promised us a couple years back, a pilot program to do three raised crosswalks.

385
00:30:39,336 --> 00:30:40,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that's not a lot in a city this size.

386
00:30:41,536 --> 00:30:44,417
[SPEAKER_04]: The mayor implemented one on Winthrop Street,

387
00:30:45,214 --> 00:30:56,779
[SPEAKER_04]: The other two on Central Ave and Harvard, they put speed bumps, not raised crosswalks, and then they removed the speed bumps, Mr. President.

388
00:30:57,179 --> 00:31:09,684
[SPEAKER_04]: I asked three times already for a response back from the administration and from DPW on what is the status of these raised crosswalks, which work great on traffic calming

389
00:31:10,291 --> 00:31:11,673
[SPEAKER_04]: within the community, Mr. President.

390
00:31:12,053 --> 00:31:13,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Widening sidewalks.

391
00:31:13,714 --> 00:31:15,516
[SPEAKER_04]: These are things that can be done.

392
00:31:16,057 --> 00:31:23,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Putting markers in the road that appear to be 3D in nature, so when you're driving, you think you're coming up to something, and there's nothing there.

393
00:31:23,604 --> 00:31:27,167
[SPEAKER_04]: But it allows the driver to slow down.

394
00:31:27,768 --> 00:31:28,729
[SPEAKER_04]: They do it in Cambridge.

395
00:31:28,749 --> 00:31:30,110
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have to recreate the wheel.

396
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:44,249
[SPEAKER_04]: These are things that are already being done, but this city, for whatever reason, Mr. President, you know, when we brought in Republic, it was to supplement the police department, not to take the duty of ticketing away from the police department.

397
00:31:44,489 --> 00:31:46,050
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was understood from day one.

398
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:48,212
[SPEAKER_04]: It was to supplement them.

399
00:31:48,232 --> 00:31:52,755
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, the police department now doesn't have to worry about the business districts and ticketing.

400
00:31:53,055 --> 00:31:57,698
[SPEAKER_04]: They should be in the neighborhoods going around and doing the proper enforcement, Mr. President.

401
00:31:58,098 --> 00:32:00,280
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just have to address, I think it was brought up by

402
00:32:00,967 --> 00:32:04,108
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Falco or Councilor Caraviello about commercial vehicles.

403
00:32:05,529 --> 00:32:16,392
[SPEAKER_04]: I can only speak for my neighborhood, Mr. President, but there's a rash of commercial vehicles parking all over the roads, and heavy commercial vehicles, Mr. President, all over the streets.

404
00:32:17,093 --> 00:32:27,076
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a real concern in a neighborhood where you're paying $5,000, $6,000, $7,000 in property tax, and I have to look out at a truck that has 35 ladders on the top of it.

405
00:32:27,956 --> 00:32:30,297
[SPEAKER_04]: And furthermore, it's ripping all the branches off the tree,

406
00:32:30,757 --> 00:32:31,458
[SPEAKER_04]: in front of the House.

407
00:32:31,878 --> 00:32:36,862
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, these are the things that, for whatever reason, you know, I don't know.

408
00:32:36,882 --> 00:32:41,226
[SPEAKER_04]: It just seems like no one cares in this community, Mr. President.

409
00:32:41,906 --> 00:32:43,107
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems like no one cares.

410
00:32:43,708 --> 00:32:48,612
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, really, I think we should ask, and I know you have a lot on your plate.

411
00:32:48,632 --> 00:32:50,213
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot going on, Mr. President.

412
00:32:50,493 --> 00:32:58,360
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think we should ask for a public safety summit with the new administration, with the chief of police, with DPW, and go over these issues.

413
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we're the sounding board.

414
00:32:59,981 --> 00:33:09,250
[SPEAKER_04]: We get the emails constantly, like we got today, the pitches of Salt Method and the other circumstances going on in Harvard and Yale and so forth.

415
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:13,829
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are the things we hear over and over again, and they never get resolved.

416
00:33:14,489 --> 00:33:22,272
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would ask, under your leadership, Mr. President — you can make a name for yourself now — under your leadership, let's start moving some of these issues forward.

417
00:33:22,992 --> 00:33:27,154
[SPEAKER_04]: So in a year from now, we won't have to say, well, it was the old President that never acted on these things.

418
00:33:27,494 --> 00:33:34,856
[SPEAKER_04]: We could say, no, we acted as a council to hold the administration and to hold the department heads accountable, Mr. President.

419
00:33:35,137 --> 00:33:36,117
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we're here for.

420
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:38,898
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would ask, Mr. President, that we set up

421
00:33:41,507 --> 00:34:00,919
[SPEAKER_04]: public safety summit, Mr. President, with the chief of police, Sergeant Carroll, who's the head of traffic division, with the DPW, the new acting commissioner, Mr. Kerens, the administration, and whoever else wants to sit down, Mr. President, so we can discuss these important public safety issues, Mr. President.

422
00:34:01,199 --> 00:34:01,560
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

423
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,101
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

424
00:34:03,861 --> 00:34:10,125
[SPEAKER_10]: And not only do you care, but I care, and Carvey cares, and all of us care.

425
00:34:11,298 --> 00:34:13,759
[SPEAKER_10]: Chair now recognizes Councilor Knight.

426
00:34:13,779 --> 00:34:14,839
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

427
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:28,703
[SPEAKER_07]: Several months back when the chief was before us speaking about the rolling out of resident parking and the resident parking situation, he did make a representation that they were going to be looking at rolling out a citywide resident parking plan.

428
00:34:29,144 --> 00:34:34,085
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'd like to amend the paper, Mr. President, to request an update on the rollout of the citywide resident parking.

429
00:34:34,945 --> 00:34:39,967
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'd also like to point out that the mayor's office is conducting a survey.

430
00:34:40,576 --> 00:34:48,198
[SPEAKER_07]: relative to their constituent services and ways to better communicate between departments and with the community, Mr. President.

431
00:34:48,338 --> 00:34:56,200
[SPEAKER_07]: And those surveys are available in room 204 here at City Hall, at the Senior Center, at the library, and online at the City of Medford's website.

432
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,780
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it's very important for us right now.

433
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:04,162
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a very unique opportunity to help the mayor shape her vision of what we'd like to see Medford be.

434
00:35:04,666 --> 00:35:07,469
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's going to take participation from the community, Mr. President.

435
00:35:07,489 --> 00:35:14,075
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that being said, I just wanted to be sure that everyone was aware that they do have that opportunity and option as well to voice their concern through the survey method.

436
00:35:37,694 --> 00:35:47,863
[SPEAKER_18]: Briefly, I just want to second the idea of a public safety summit, whether it's a committee, the whole meeting, I'd even take that, where the mayor is involved and the chief of police and the city council.

437
00:35:47,923 --> 00:35:52,587
[SPEAKER_18]: So we can really decide and make changes so we can hear

438
00:35:53,034 --> 00:35:58,116
[SPEAKER_18]: how our new administration is making changes with the chief of police and how we're going to move forward.

439
00:35:58,396 --> 00:36:04,718
[SPEAKER_18]: We cannot enforce the way we enforced prior to January 4, 2016.

440
00:36:04,878 --> 00:36:06,678
[SPEAKER_18]: It just cannot happen.

441
00:36:06,738 --> 00:36:07,839
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not right for the city.

442
00:36:08,139 --> 00:36:09,339
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not going to better the city.

443
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:10,959
[SPEAKER_18]: We need enforcement.

444
00:36:10,979 --> 00:36:19,102
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think bringing everybody to the table probably will be best because today I have an issue with people parking on the sidewalks.

445
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:29,257
[SPEAKER_18]: But it involves enforcement in general and how we're going to move forward with enforcement, because I do remember the story, and I knew we were known for the no enforcement.

446
00:36:29,297 --> 00:36:32,380
[SPEAKER_18]: I forgot the major news stations picked up on it.

447
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:36,963
[SPEAKER_18]: But, yes, I remember it clearly now, and it was embarrassing.

448
00:36:37,043 --> 00:36:45,490
[SPEAKER_18]: And I really hope that we can move forward, make changes, let the public know, give a warning time to the public.

449
00:36:46,531 --> 00:36:49,932
[SPEAKER_18]: and do the things we need to do for the public's public safety.

450
00:36:50,392 --> 00:36:51,272
[SPEAKER_18]: Somebody did get hurt.

451
00:36:51,312 --> 00:36:55,653
[SPEAKER_18]: Many people have gotten hurt and many more people will get hurt if we do not make some changes.

452
00:36:56,233 --> 00:36:56,593
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

453
00:36:56,633 --> 00:37:01,855
[SPEAKER_10]: So on the motion of approved by council and night is seconded by a vice-president Lugo Kern as amended.

454
00:37:02,055 --> 00:37:05,035
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor roll call vote has been requested.

455
00:37:05,076 --> 00:37:09,297
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Clerk, if you would please call the roll council.

456
00:37:09,317 --> 00:37:14,858
[SPEAKER_09]: Caraviello council Falco council night vice-president Lugo Kern.

457
00:37:14,978 --> 00:37:15,178
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

458
00:37:15,803 --> 00:37:16,484
[SPEAKER_09]: Council Marks.

459
00:37:16,724 --> 00:37:17,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

460
00:37:17,225 --> 00:37:18,126
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli.

461
00:37:18,226 --> 00:37:18,667
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

462
00:37:19,087 --> 00:37:19,968
[SPEAKER_09]: President Dello Russo.

463
00:37:20,028 --> 00:37:20,469
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

464
00:37:20,569 --> 00:37:23,553
[SPEAKER_10]: With the vote of seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, the motion passes.

465
00:37:23,633 --> 00:37:26,797
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion passes into the rules as well.

466
00:37:27,297 --> 00:37:28,379
[SPEAKER_18]: For what purpose?

467
00:37:28,419 --> 00:37:33,946
[SPEAKER_07]: We have several pocket related papers Mr. President that are in your hands and I think it would make sense for us to continue that discussion while we're on broader.

468
00:37:34,546 --> 00:37:36,207
[SPEAKER_10]: And also to allow a president to speak.

469
00:37:36,227 --> 00:37:41,231
[SPEAKER_10]: The motion for approval for suspension of the rules to take parking papers in the hands of the clerk.

470
00:37:41,251 --> 00:37:42,151
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

471
00:37:42,732 --> 00:37:43,372
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

472
00:37:43,693 --> 00:37:44,573
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion carries.

473
00:37:45,194 --> 00:37:47,855
[SPEAKER_10]: Papers in the hands of the clerk under suspension.

474
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,857
[SPEAKER_10]: We will start with 16-042.

475
00:37:53,519 --> 00:38:01,805
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of these were submitted but by some sort of expiration of time.

476
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:05,488
[SPEAKER_10]: They didn't make it onto our desks.

477
00:38:05,508 --> 00:38:06,928
[SPEAKER_10]: 15-042 offered by Councilor Caraviello.

478
00:38:07,389 --> 00:38:20,735
[SPEAKER_10]: Be resolved that the Medford City Council requests that the owner of the Bigelow building on the corner of Forest and Salem Street take the necessary action to remove the graffiti that has been on the building for some time now.

479
00:38:22,076 --> 00:38:30,660
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, we also ask that the owner find a solution for the unsightly trash problem that persists at that location.

480
00:38:31,248 --> 00:38:33,270
[SPEAKER_10]: please see attachment of photographs.

481
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:35,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Chair recognizes councilor Caraviello.

482
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:36,492
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

483
00:38:36,512 --> 00:38:40,155
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Mr. President, this has been a long, ongoing problem.

484
00:38:40,576 --> 00:38:43,718
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the chief goes out and, you know, see something, say something.

485
00:38:44,179 --> 00:38:48,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, obviously this didn't take five minutes, two, three minutes to do.

486
00:38:49,523 --> 00:38:52,886
[SPEAKER_05]: And hundreds of cars go up and down Forest Street all day long.

487
00:38:53,686 --> 00:38:58,650
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't, I don't understand how, uh, no one saw people standing out there with

488
00:39:00,408 --> 00:39:10,431
[SPEAKER_05]: 10 cans of spray paint painting over windows and on a fire escape and didn't see anything happening and didn't call the police.

489
00:39:10,991 --> 00:39:20,553
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, Mr. President, if you see down on the second photo, the dumpsters that are always out on Forest Street.

490
00:39:21,674 --> 00:39:27,375
[SPEAKER_05]: And right now they happen to be empty, but if you go by there on a Monday, they're full and it looks disgusting.

491
00:39:28,383 --> 00:39:35,246
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd ask that the owner of that building also come up with a gate or something to put over that so it doesn't look so unsightly.

492
00:39:36,767 --> 00:39:47,991
[SPEAKER_05]: I know the Board of Health has been down there multiple times and as you can see, to the right of the dumpster, you see multiple trash bags that are just sitting there.

493
00:39:49,111 --> 00:39:50,632
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a restaurant right next door.

494
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:56,031
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm sure that the Board of Health shouldn't condone that.

495
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:59,072
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, if there was a fence there, it would look a lot nicer.

496
00:39:59,152 --> 00:40:07,434
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't know if we have a notice on our books that could force the owner of that building to clean up the graffiti that's there.

497
00:40:07,534 --> 00:40:12,336
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very unsightly, Forest Street is a busy street, you get the post office there.

498
00:40:12,996 --> 00:40:20,058
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're always talking about economic development, well, economic development doesn't

499
00:40:21,462 --> 00:40:23,043
[SPEAKER_05]: call for graffiti art on buildings.

500
00:40:23,544 --> 00:40:31,070
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's, uh, I would, I would motion that it goes to either the code enforcement officer, uh, I think to, uh, maybe have this cleaned up.

501
00:40:32,952 --> 00:40:33,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.

502
00:40:33,292 --> 00:40:36,495
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the motion for approval, uh, by Councilor Caraviello, all those in favor.

503
00:40:36,515 --> 00:40:36,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President.

504
00:40:37,255 --> 00:40:37,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor.

505
00:40:40,819 --> 00:40:43,381
[SPEAKER_04]: I want, I want to thank Councilor Caraviello for bringing this up.

506
00:40:43,481 --> 00:40:48,605
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, you know, the ironic thing is if you look at the trash bin, it says, uh, there's a big sign on it says, go green.

507
00:40:49,426 --> 00:40:49,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh,

508
00:40:50,068 --> 00:40:51,650
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, with all the trash hanging out of it.

509
00:40:52,711 --> 00:41:02,981
[SPEAKER_04]: But needless to say, Mr. President, other communities, in Worcester in particular, have taken very creative ways of dealing with people that do graffiti.

510
00:41:03,001 --> 00:41:10,169
[SPEAKER_04]: You're never going to eradicate graffiti, but they've set up sections in their city and they've installed boards, maybe 10 by 20 boards.

511
00:41:12,667 --> 00:41:13,647
[SPEAKER_04]: in particular areas.

512
00:41:13,967 --> 00:41:32,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of them are in parks, some of them are in downtown business districts, and they allow these graffiti artists, and many of them consider themselves artists, to go and actually on a city-owned piece of wall, which they create, to go out and express themselves on this particular wall.

513
00:41:32,713 --> 00:41:36,894
[SPEAKER_04]: And they found out over years of looking at this and researching,

514
00:41:37,301 --> 00:41:41,104
[SPEAKER_04]: that the number of graffiti incidences dropped, Mr. President.

515
00:41:41,645 --> 00:41:46,449
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was because the city took a proactive step in not saying, oh, we're going to go after these people.

516
00:41:46,469 --> 00:41:47,730
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to put cameras everywhere.

517
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:48,891
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to arrest them.

518
00:41:49,232 --> 00:41:50,913
[SPEAKER_04]: But they got creative and said, you know what?

519
00:41:51,474 --> 00:41:52,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't we erect our own wall?

520
00:41:52,995 --> 00:41:54,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't we invite these people?

521
00:41:54,877 --> 00:41:55,597
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not illegal.

522
00:41:55,657 --> 00:41:56,738
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do it on this wall.

523
00:41:56,978 --> 00:41:58,099
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to build you a wall.

524
00:41:59,231 --> 00:42:04,533
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to allow graffiti artists to go down anytime you want and put your own marking on it.

525
00:42:04,573 --> 00:42:06,453
[SPEAKER_04]: You can put your own fair, whatever you want to do.

526
00:42:06,853 --> 00:42:07,433
[SPEAKER_04]: And guess what?

527
00:42:07,674 --> 00:42:09,794
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be covered over and covered over and covered over.

528
00:42:10,254 --> 00:42:15,516
[SPEAKER_04]: And it allows a freedom of expression, Mr. President, similar to what we allow the artist.

529
00:42:15,896 --> 00:42:20,937
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not comparing people that do tagging to our art population in the city.

530
00:42:21,378 --> 00:42:22,778
[SPEAKER_04]: But last year,

531
00:42:23,481 --> 00:42:29,826
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, the Mackey group got together and they did yard, uh, yarn bombing in many of the poles in the square.

532
00:42:29,846 --> 00:42:31,086
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if people saw it.

533
00:42:31,126 --> 00:42:33,748
[SPEAKER_04]: They had yarn, all different color yarn wrapped up the pole.

534
00:42:34,148 --> 00:42:40,733
[SPEAKER_04]: And it just, it was, when you looked at it, it gave a sense of, uh, just pride, a sense of a homey type feeling.

535
00:42:41,093 --> 00:42:42,694
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just, it was great what they did.

536
00:42:42,734 --> 00:42:45,516
[SPEAKER_04]: They painted the electrical boxes around the community.

537
00:42:45,976 --> 00:42:49,639
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are the things, Mr. President, maybe if we reached out to, uh,

538
00:42:49,978 --> 00:42:53,579
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we're able to unite with some of these taggers and reach out.

539
00:42:53,619 --> 00:42:55,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they could do some good in the community.

540
00:42:55,600 --> 00:43:05,744
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe we could put them to work on doing some nice painting on our hydrants or other boxes that are owned by the city and not create this adversarial type thing.

541
00:43:06,324 --> 00:43:10,386
[SPEAKER_04]: And like I said, it's never going to go away, but it's a suggestion, Mr. President.

542
00:43:10,446 --> 00:43:16,428
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all it is, is a suggestion, something I think we can look at maybe as a council and offer the recommendation.

543
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:18,009
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, Mr. President?

544
00:43:18,914 --> 00:43:30,681
[SPEAKER_04]: I offered two resolutions recently to take a look at the tea shelter on Riverside Avenue Square across from the old McDonald's.

545
00:43:31,781 --> 00:43:40,826
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm proud to say, Mr. President, I asked in several resolutions to repurpose that area that really is being used for nothing in the square.

546
00:43:41,126 --> 00:43:42,107
[SPEAKER_04]: It's dilapidated.

547
00:43:42,387 --> 00:43:45,488
[SPEAKER_04]: The tiles on the roof are coming down.

548
00:43:46,989 --> 00:43:48,330
[SPEAKER_04]: The facade is falling apart.

549
00:43:48,918 --> 00:44:02,464
[SPEAKER_04]: And to turn this into a repurpose, multi-purpose area for outdoor performances, to maybe even have a board where taggers can go down and have an area for that such activity, Mr. President.

550
00:44:02,824 --> 00:44:06,045
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm proud to say that this is sitting administration.

551
00:44:06,686 --> 00:44:13,169
[SPEAKER_04]: The new mayor has picked up on the suggestion and is having a public meeting on the Riverside Ave Plaza.

552
00:44:13,889 --> 00:44:16,410
[SPEAKER_04]: And it says anyone in Method submitting an application

553
00:44:16,998 --> 00:44:34,743
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, it says the City of Medford is submitting an application to the Mass Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs, Department of Conservation Services for funding under the Land and Water Conservation Grant Program to be used for the rehabilitation of Riverside Ave Plaza area in Medford Square.

554
00:44:35,143 --> 00:44:39,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor Stephanie Buccini-Burke invites you to give your input prior to the submission of the application.

555
00:44:40,445 --> 00:44:41,685
[SPEAKER_04]: So Thursday, February 4th,

556
00:44:43,337 --> 00:44:44,117
[SPEAKER_04]: At 6 p.m.

557
00:44:44,637 --> 00:44:54,204
[SPEAKER_04]: here in the chambers, they will have a meeting to discuss any possible uses of that particular area, Mr. President.

558
00:44:54,745 --> 00:45:03,952
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm glad to see that this current administration is actually looking at things that are offered by the council and acting upon them, Mr. President.

559
00:45:04,212 --> 00:45:10,476
[SPEAKER_04]: So if anyone's interested in the repurposing of this particular area, I would recommend Thursday, February 4th at 6 p.m.

560
00:45:11,593 --> 00:45:13,154
[SPEAKER_04]: here in the chamber at City Hall.

561
00:45:13,594 --> 00:45:16,256
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to thank the administration, Mr. President.

562
00:45:16,636 --> 00:45:17,036
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

563
00:45:17,336 --> 00:45:17,716
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

564
00:45:18,017 --> 00:45:25,721
[SPEAKER_10]: And your committee for the distribution of linkage funds has funded this effort on behalf of the citizens.

565
00:45:30,464 --> 00:45:37,348
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a motion for approval as amended by Councilor Marks to send this note of recommendation to

566
00:45:38,478 --> 00:45:42,462
[SPEAKER_10]: The Transition Committee for Culture and Recreation.

567
00:45:43,603 --> 00:45:43,823
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

568
00:45:44,544 --> 00:45:48,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Caraviello will sum up this item before we take a vote.

569
00:45:48,087 --> 00:45:48,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

570
00:45:49,028 --> 00:46:00,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, Mr. President, I don't know, but when you drive down Mystic Avenue, in Somerville, on the highway wall, they have put up boards like Councilor Marksley suggested, and you see art on there.

571
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:04,002
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you get down by the new assembly on the underpass there,

572
00:46:04,821 --> 00:46:10,182
[SPEAKER_05]: The trend there, there's boards there that people have done art and makes it look a lot nicer.

573
00:46:10,543 --> 00:46:18,305
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've seen it in other cities, where they're done on the highways, they're done on the underpasses, where they're unsightly, and this brings it out.

574
00:46:18,745 --> 00:46:20,385
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also want to thank the mayor.

575
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:29,608
[SPEAKER_05]: I know Councilor Marx has brought this forward on a couple of different years for finally bringing this up, and for her

576
00:46:31,828 --> 00:46:32,829
[SPEAKER_05]: having a meeting on the 4th.

577
00:46:32,889 --> 00:46:34,090
[SPEAKER_05]: So I hope everyone will attend.

578
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:38,894
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion for approval, Mr. Citizen, please state your name and address for the record.

579
00:46:38,934 --> 00:46:39,235
[SPEAKER_14]: Welcome.

580
00:46:39,695 --> 00:46:40,576
[SPEAKER_14]: My name is Michael Ruggiero.

581
00:46:40,616 --> 00:46:42,017
[SPEAKER_14]: I live on 18 Pembroke Street.

582
00:46:42,357 --> 00:46:44,299
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, I love the idea of Councilor Marks.

583
00:46:44,339 --> 00:46:47,502
[SPEAKER_14]: I've seen it done successfully in a number of cities, Los Angeles included.

584
00:46:48,583 --> 00:46:53,147
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, but my concern involves more than just the idea of getting a wall to make sure that

585
00:46:53,643 --> 00:46:54,843
[SPEAKER_14]: people can express themselves.

586
00:46:55,384 --> 00:47:08,129
[SPEAKER_14]: My concern is that if we have a parks department that has trouble emptying trash cans, responding to people that leave when the park lights are left on all night, needles that are sometimes found in parks.

587
00:47:08,489 --> 00:47:09,749
[SPEAKER_14]: My concern is broader.

588
00:47:10,069 --> 00:47:18,853
[SPEAKER_14]: If we can't have a park system that addresses these major problems, perhaps a wall with some interesting art on it might not suffice.

589
00:47:19,173 --> 00:47:19,393
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

590
00:47:20,221 --> 00:47:21,882
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion for approval, all those in favor?

591
00:47:22,582 --> 00:47:23,282
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

592
00:47:24,002 --> 00:47:24,863
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion carries.

593
00:47:25,323 --> 00:47:45,269
[SPEAKER_10]: While we're in suspension, continuing, 16-043 offered by Councilor Caraviello, be it resolved that the Medford City Council request the Massachusetts State Police increase enforcement on Mystic Valley Parkway and Auburn Street for vehicles making the illegal left-hand turn onto Auburn Street both during the morning and evening rush hour times.

594
00:47:45,369 --> 00:47:47,830
[SPEAKER_10]: We also ask that the Medford Police increase enforcement

595
00:47:48,257 --> 00:47:58,463
[SPEAKER_10]: on Auburn and Prescott Street area during the same period, as drivers use these streets as the shortcut to avoid parkway traffic.

596
00:47:58,523 --> 00:47:59,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Caraviello.

597
00:47:59,564 --> 00:48:00,385
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

598
00:48:00,605 --> 00:48:06,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, you know, the problem of taking that left after the Whole Foods, it's not a new problem.

599
00:48:06,889 --> 00:48:09,690
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been going on for probably 30 years.

600
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:13,693
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the past, there has been enforcement there.

601
00:48:14,093 --> 00:48:18,114
[SPEAKER_05]: But I've not seen a state trooper there, and I lived in that area in many, many years.

602
00:48:18,434 --> 00:48:30,416
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd say, especially during that morning and the evening rush hour, when the parkway is backed up down the Dillwood Field there, people are just cutting off, thinking they're getting a shortcut when they really not.

603
00:48:31,276 --> 00:48:36,617
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's stop signs at Auburn Street and Prescott right at the school.

604
00:48:37,297 --> 00:48:40,677
[SPEAKER_05]: And people don't even adhere to the stop signs anymore.

605
00:48:41,578 --> 00:48:42,878
[SPEAKER_05]: They're cutting down Prescott Street.

606
00:48:44,292 --> 00:48:45,452
[SPEAKER_05]: during these rush hour times.

607
00:48:45,512 --> 00:48:50,073
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, there's stop signs on all these streets, and people just go right through it.

608
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:53,874
[SPEAKER_05]: If you stand out there and you yell at them, they ignore you.

609
00:48:53,934 --> 00:48:55,654
[SPEAKER_05]: They make obscene gestures to you.

610
00:48:56,014 --> 00:48:57,135
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's children in that neighborhood.

611
00:48:57,375 --> 00:48:58,175
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a school area.

612
00:48:58,935 --> 00:49:07,277
[SPEAKER_05]: And like I said, I ask that we call the state police and step up some enforcement over there on that illegal turn.

613
00:49:07,317 --> 00:49:13,618
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, if the Medford police could do a little enforcement over by the school during those rush hour times, Mr. President.

614
00:49:27,276 --> 00:49:29,017
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

615
00:49:29,697 --> 00:49:37,922
[SPEAKER_18]: We always have complaints with regards to speeding, and my neighbor, who lives on Highland Ave, has complained to me recently.

616
00:49:38,762 --> 00:49:41,404
[SPEAKER_18]: The speeding on Highland Ave is out of control.

617
00:49:44,245 --> 00:49:48,808
[SPEAKER_18]: If we could get an increased enforcement, whether that's some ticketing,

618
00:49:49,768 --> 00:49:50,889
[SPEAKER_18]: That would be very helpful.

619
00:49:51,449 --> 00:49:55,572
[SPEAKER_18]: I know there was a near miss recently that was witnessed by my neighbor.

620
00:49:55,592 --> 00:50:03,938
[SPEAKER_18]: And this is just one other thing that does need some enforcing, if I could amend that.

621
00:50:03,958 --> 00:50:09,662
[SPEAKER_18]: And also, I know we have the electronic sign that's kind of as a traffic calming approach, if we could get that.

622
00:50:10,083 --> 00:50:13,865
[SPEAKER_18]: Number one, get that out, whether that's for a week or two on Highland Ave.

623
00:50:14,206 --> 00:50:16,267
[SPEAKER_18]: But also see if our department can

624
00:50:18,263 --> 00:50:23,805
[SPEAKER_18]: do a couple traps in the area that, I believe it's 25, and you have people go in almost 50.

625
00:50:23,945 --> 00:50:30,687
[SPEAKER_18]: It's almost a speedway on Highland Ave as you head into Maldon, Woodland Road.

626
00:50:32,107 --> 00:50:34,128
[SPEAKER_18]: So if we could do that, it would be greatly appreciated.

627
00:50:47,972 --> 00:50:48,492
[SPEAKER_03]: If I can.

628
00:50:49,593 --> 00:50:51,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

629
00:50:52,474 --> 00:50:58,176
[SPEAKER_03]: We also amend that the chief also look at the speeding issues on Salem Street.

630
00:50:58,816 --> 00:51:12,002
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're realizing that neighbors have called that they're cut through from Salem Street to the Fellsway and using the streets on the left of going toward Malden.

631
00:51:12,902 --> 00:51:15,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Cutting through Cherry Street is probably one of the biggest

632
00:51:16,367 --> 00:51:19,549
[SPEAKER_03]: streets that they're using as a cut-through, Power Street, Cherry Street.

633
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:23,772
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other one is on Spring Street.

634
00:51:25,293 --> 00:51:30,096
[SPEAKER_03]: They're using, after the satellites, where the Super Red is.

635
00:51:30,937 --> 00:51:32,118
[SPEAKER_03]: That's an area of concern.

636
00:51:32,598 --> 00:51:44,946
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that, and I know that I appreciate Councilor Brianna, my current focusing on the speed machine, this tracking, so really deter the speeding.

637
00:51:44,986 --> 00:51:45,947
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we can amend that,

638
00:51:46,502 --> 00:51:47,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Those two areas, too, I'd appreciate it.

639
00:51:48,003 --> 00:51:48,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

640
00:51:48,543 --> 00:51:48,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

641
00:51:49,044 --> 00:52:07,214
[SPEAKER_10]: So as amended by Councilor Scott Palac to include Salem Street, Cherry, and Spring, one of the efforts that made quite a difference on Harvard Street was the installation of solar-powered speed tracking devices, which worked quite well.

642
00:52:07,555 --> 00:52:09,556
[SPEAKER_10]: Chair recognizes Councilor Haynes.

643
00:52:09,596 --> 00:52:10,596
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

644
00:52:12,958 --> 00:52:20,061
[SPEAKER_07]: Over in the city of Malden, right at the Highland Ave line, along the Fellsway, there is a crazy rotary right down there.

645
00:52:20,101 --> 00:52:21,582
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a backwards rotary, actually.

646
00:52:22,323 --> 00:52:23,563
[SPEAKER_07]: It operates in reverse.

647
00:52:23,583 --> 00:52:25,804
[SPEAKER_07]: So you normally would drive through a rotary.

648
00:52:25,824 --> 00:52:28,786
[SPEAKER_07]: It's supposed to yield at this location, right at the foot of Highland Ave.

649
00:52:29,206 --> 00:52:42,032
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's been brought to my understanding that Councilman Matheson and Secretary Pollack at the Department of Transportation have been discussing a traffic study relative to the redesign of that intersection, Mr. President.

650
00:52:42,913 --> 00:52:58,951
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it might be beneficial to us to request an update or have our DPW director or our office of engineering request an update as to the discussions that are going on between the state and the city of Malden relative to the changes at the Rotary because they will certainly have a large impact on the traffic patterns that are going to back up into Medford.

651
00:52:59,699 --> 00:53:03,963
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe the positive impacts, maybe the negative, until we know what's going on, Mr. President.

652
00:53:04,063 --> 00:53:06,646
[SPEAKER_07]: I really am not comfortable commenting, and that's why I'm asking for an update.

653
00:53:07,347 --> 00:53:07,647
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.

654
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:14,093
[SPEAKER_10]: So as amended by Councilor Knight on the May motion, as amended by Councilor Langley-Curran and also Councilor Schapiro.

655
00:53:15,447 --> 00:53:17,508
[SPEAKER_10]: The chair recognizes the citizen at the podium.

656
00:53:17,748 --> 00:53:18,088
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome.

657
00:53:18,428 --> 00:53:20,308
[SPEAKER_10]: Please state your name and address for the record, Ms.

658
00:53:20,348 --> 00:53:20,588
[SPEAKER_10]: Martin.

659
00:53:20,788 --> 00:53:22,069
[SPEAKER_15]: Jean Martin, 10 Cumming Street.

660
00:53:22,209 --> 00:53:24,829
[SPEAKER_15]: And I wanted to say that Mr. Marks is right on the money.

661
00:53:24,869 --> 00:53:28,090
[SPEAKER_15]: He's been on for years talking about traffic calming measures.

662
00:53:29,071 --> 00:53:30,611
[SPEAKER_15]: And it needs to be done systematically.

663
00:53:30,631 --> 00:53:34,652
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think this guy back here, Michael.

664
00:53:35,172 --> 00:53:38,573
[SPEAKER_15]: Michael had talked about an engineer coming in, a traffic engineer or something.

665
00:53:38,994 --> 00:53:49,459
[SPEAKER_15]: to come in to look at it as a systematic thing, because what I keep on hearing is this street, and this street, and this street, and it's not being tackled as a systemic issue.

666
00:53:50,139 --> 00:54:02,185
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'd like to add, it needs to be thought of as a systematic approach, that the whole city needs to have this looked at, all of it, all of it, just the whole

667
00:54:03,108 --> 00:54:05,529
[SPEAKER_15]: But I can't say it anymore.

668
00:54:05,649 --> 00:54:14,795
[SPEAKER_15]: And also in the interim, the speed light, the traffic lights, have we ever put on cameras on the top of the traffic lights?

669
00:54:14,835 --> 00:54:19,337
[SPEAKER_15]: And maybe we ought to, because speeding through a red light is getting more easy to do.

670
00:54:19,898 --> 00:54:23,079
[SPEAKER_15]: As you know, yellow is not yellow in Medford.

671
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:27,762
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just wanted to let you know that we need to, because people are getting more aggressive.

672
00:54:27,942 --> 00:54:28,422
[SPEAKER_15]: They really are.

673
00:54:28,823 --> 00:54:29,083
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

674
00:54:33,996 --> 00:54:39,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Just also, if we could add enforcement, Mr. President, at the intersection of Park and Doonan.

675
00:54:44,807 --> 00:54:45,507
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, council.

676
00:54:45,527 --> 00:54:48,408
[SPEAKER_10]: And the chair now recognizes, thank you.

677
00:54:48,768 --> 00:54:56,031
[SPEAKER_10]: So on the motion of approval by councilor Lungo-Koehn as amended, seconded by councilor Caraviello.

678
00:54:56,051 --> 00:54:56,831
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

679
00:54:57,391 --> 00:54:58,012
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

680
00:54:58,612 --> 00:54:59,532
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion carries.

681
00:55:00,052 --> 00:55:08,715
[SPEAKER_10]: Offered by councilor Caraviello, be it resolved that Medford City Council request for the second time, a report from Republic Parking after the first year at Medford.

682
00:55:09,215 --> 00:55:13,557
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, we request a meeting to discuss its past and present practices

683
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:17,682
[SPEAKER_10]: to see what is working in the best interest of our residents.

684
00:55:18,042 --> 00:55:18,922
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Caraviello.

685
00:55:19,302 --> 00:55:20,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

686
00:55:20,723 --> 00:55:33,048
[SPEAKER_05]: I think two weeks ago, maybe longer, we asked for a report from Republic on the parking after one full year, and I don't think it takes three weeks to get a report from them.

687
00:55:33,789 --> 00:55:34,589
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know where it is.

688
00:55:34,909 --> 00:55:43,873
[SPEAKER_05]: But also, Mr. President, I think this council needs to sit down with Republic and discuss the practices that they're using in our city.

689
00:55:44,285 --> 00:55:48,487
[SPEAKER_05]: Some are good, some are bad, and let's amend some of them.

690
00:55:49,007 --> 00:55:52,169
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I know we have some people in the audience that are going to want to speak about this thing.

691
00:55:52,629 --> 00:55:59,793
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, they're not a very customer service friendly company, and I think that needs to change.

692
00:56:00,253 --> 00:56:10,959
[SPEAKER_05]: If they're going to be here for the next seven or eight years, ten years, nine more years, I think that's something that needs to be discussed, and how they're going to do this.

693
00:56:10,999 --> 00:56:13,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, it's not going to work out for the people.

694
00:56:14,413 --> 00:56:15,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor.

695
00:56:15,494 --> 00:56:15,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening.

696
00:56:15,974 --> 00:56:17,555
[SPEAKER_10]: Please state your name and address for the record.

697
00:56:17,756 --> 00:56:18,276
[SPEAKER_19]: Good evening.

698
00:56:18,376 --> 00:56:20,217
[SPEAKER_19]: My name is Linda Kelly-Poinsky.

699
00:56:20,277 --> 00:56:21,759
[SPEAKER_19]: This is my husband, Michael.

700
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:23,760
[SPEAKER_19]: We live at 23 Marion Street.

701
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:24,200
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome.

702
00:56:24,661 --> 00:56:25,061
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

703
00:56:25,081 --> 00:56:29,444
[SPEAKER_19]: I would like to say, President de la Ruzo, thank you for calling me back today.

704
00:56:29,464 --> 00:56:36,690
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd like to thank Councilman Cavallaro, Marks, and Scappelli, who all emailed me back today, so I really appreciate that.

705
00:56:38,511 --> 00:56:46,797
[SPEAKER_19]: I live at 23 Marion Street and in October we received a letter stating that they were turning our street to permit parking.

706
00:56:47,518 --> 00:56:53,322
[SPEAKER_19]: My understanding, the reason for doing this is because we've had a lot of issues with the church, which I live next to.

707
00:56:53,962 --> 00:56:57,043
[SPEAKER_19]: And we've had, well, people were concerned about the T coming in.

708
00:56:57,883 --> 00:57:01,283
[SPEAKER_19]: So that was my understanding from the hearings that I went to, to hear about this.

709
00:57:01,803 --> 00:57:03,044
[SPEAKER_19]: So I had no problem with it.

710
00:57:03,104 --> 00:57:04,404
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm perfectly fine with that.

711
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:05,264
[SPEAKER_19]: I own my home.

712
00:57:05,324 --> 00:57:06,224
[SPEAKER_19]: I pay my bills.

713
00:57:06,424 --> 00:57:07,904
[SPEAKER_19]: I follow the law.

714
00:57:07,964 --> 00:57:08,725
[SPEAKER_19]: And I said, you know what?

715
00:57:08,845 --> 00:57:09,745
[SPEAKER_19]: I agree it's an issue.

716
00:57:10,245 --> 00:57:15,786
[SPEAKER_19]: So I went in the middle of October down to Park Medford, and I purchased a parking pass for my vehicle.

717
00:57:15,866 --> 00:57:19,466
[SPEAKER_19]: They were out of passes, but they were going to scan our plate.

718
00:57:19,526 --> 00:57:21,087
[SPEAKER_19]: So we had to give our plate information.

719
00:57:21,127 --> 00:57:22,167
[SPEAKER_19]: We didn't get a sticker.

720
00:57:23,211 --> 00:57:25,532
[SPEAKER_19]: So I thought, you know what, I'm okay with this.

721
00:57:25,592 --> 00:57:32,136
[SPEAKER_19]: I dealt with a woman named Pam down there, very nice lady, was willing to talk and was very good.

722
00:57:33,196 --> 00:57:37,258
[SPEAKER_19]: January 2nd, I come out of my house and I have a parking ticket on my car.

723
00:57:38,239 --> 00:57:42,301
[SPEAKER_19]: I drove down to Park Medford, I go in, I'm like, Pam, what is this ticket?

724
00:57:43,438 --> 00:57:52,684
[SPEAKER_19]: So basically, I was told at that time that the parking pass that I purchased in the middle of November was only good until the last day of December.

725
00:57:53,164 --> 00:57:57,927
[SPEAKER_19]: I was expected to go back January 1st to buy another parking pass.

726
00:57:58,708 --> 00:58:04,231
[SPEAKER_19]: At that time, I said, that just really doesn't feel very good to me.

727
00:58:04,251 --> 00:58:05,652
[SPEAKER_19]: I am really bothered by this.

728
00:58:06,092 --> 00:58:07,834
[SPEAKER_19]: So I went down and I talked to Pam.

729
00:58:07,954 --> 00:58:13,177
[SPEAKER_19]: Pam told me that I needed to go through Chief Sacco, who I know because I've also done a lot of work in this community.

730
00:58:13,756 --> 00:58:17,719
[SPEAKER_19]: I call down, Chief Sacco's on vacation, I talk to Alba.

731
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:22,723
[SPEAKER_19]: She tells me that the chief really has nothing to do with it, I need to deal with Park Medford.

732
00:58:23,184 --> 00:58:27,027
[SPEAKER_19]: I go back down to Park Medford, I talk to Pam again.

733
00:58:28,584 --> 00:58:33,889
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, very nice, and said, well, yeah, I thought it was him, so maybe you should go to the mayor.

734
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:51,745
[SPEAKER_19]: So I call up to the mayor's office, I speak with, I believe her name was Lauren, but Stephanie also at another time, explained the situation, and my impression was with our new mayor, that was part of her platform in this election campaign was helping to fix the issues of Medford with the parking.

735
00:58:52,676 --> 00:58:56,784
[SPEAKER_19]: So they were both very nice, let's check into it, we will get back to you.

736
00:58:57,646 --> 00:59:04,479
[SPEAKER_19]: Didn't hear back, so I called back and basically was told that the mayor's office has nothing to do with it, that I needed to deal with Park Medford.

737
00:59:05,332 --> 00:59:07,413
[SPEAKER_19]: At that time, I went back to Park Medford.

738
00:59:07,453 --> 00:59:10,074
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd become very good friends with Pam and the other staff down there.

739
00:59:11,574 --> 00:59:13,215
[SPEAKER_19]: And again, she couldn't have been any nicer.

740
00:59:13,255 --> 00:59:16,156
[SPEAKER_19]: And she said, I have to present this to Jim.

741
00:59:16,356 --> 00:59:17,376
[SPEAKER_19]: I need to talk to Jim.

742
00:59:17,476 --> 00:59:19,437
[SPEAKER_19]: I didn't know who Dan was at that time.

743
00:59:20,177 --> 00:59:22,378
[SPEAKER_19]: So she said, I'll get back to you.

744
00:59:22,398 --> 00:59:24,058
[SPEAKER_19]: A couple days later, I hadn't heard back.

745
00:59:24,098 --> 00:59:25,319
[SPEAKER_19]: I went back down, talked to her.

746
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:26,759
[SPEAKER_19]: She said, I haven't gotten to him yet.

747
00:59:27,159 --> 00:59:28,340
[SPEAKER_19]: I went down the next week.

748
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:30,080
[SPEAKER_19]: She said, I'm getting to him tomorrow.

749
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:30,781
[SPEAKER_19]: She got to him.

750
00:59:31,661 --> 00:59:33,782
[SPEAKER_19]: Then she tells me, sorry, that's their policy.

751
00:59:33,802 --> 00:59:34,962
[SPEAKER_19]: We're not doing anything about it.

752
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:37,561
[SPEAKER_19]: So I went back down and I talked to Pam.

753
00:59:39,142 --> 00:59:49,510
[SPEAKER_19]: And I don't want to get anybody in trouble, but it's been interesting because in the stream of offices that I've talked to, everybody's comment has been, that is ridiculous.

754
00:59:50,250 --> 00:59:51,811
[SPEAKER_19]: And it is ridiculous.

755
00:59:51,831 --> 00:59:53,973
[SPEAKER_19]: We're talking about a $10 parking pass.

756
00:59:54,013 --> 00:59:56,454
[SPEAKER_19]: And to be honest with you, this has nothing to do with the money.

757
00:59:56,915 --> 01:00:00,097
[SPEAKER_19]: This has to do with the fact that I purchased a pass the middle of November.

758
01:00:01,176 --> 01:00:03,380
[SPEAKER_19]: that it should have been prorated, something.

759
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:10,753
[SPEAKER_19]: But the fact that I have to buy another one for January now, all the vehicles in my house are in our driveway and that's where they will stay.

760
01:00:12,297 --> 01:00:14,158
[SPEAKER_19]: I feel like I don't know where to go with this.

761
01:00:14,298 --> 01:00:15,960
[SPEAKER_19]: I feel like I'm getting nowhere.

762
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:19,502
[SPEAKER_19]: My husband and I have talked about this endlessly.

763
01:00:20,263 --> 01:00:28,549
[SPEAKER_19]: I had a conversation, I have three adult children and their friends were over for dinner a couple of weeks ago and this topic came up around the dining room table.

764
01:00:29,110 --> 01:00:33,793
[SPEAKER_19]: And I had six young adults in their 20s saying to me, why even bother?

765
01:00:33,833 --> 01:00:34,514
[SPEAKER_19]: Just pay it.

766
01:00:34,734 --> 01:00:35,955
[SPEAKER_19]: It's going to get you nowhere.

767
01:00:36,315 --> 01:00:39,538
[SPEAKER_19]: It was amazing to me that not one of them knew who any of you were

768
01:00:40,198 --> 01:00:47,260
[SPEAKER_19]: Didn't have any interest in politics and basically we're sitting there saying to me you can't fight City Hall It doesn't matter if it's not right.

769
01:00:47,361 --> 01:00:48,601
[SPEAKER_19]: Nobody's gonna listen to you.

770
01:00:48,961 --> 01:01:02,706
[SPEAKER_19]: You're gonna go in front of the council They're gonna say okay, and you're gonna hear nothing and I want to prove them wrong because I do have faith in you all I have faith that you will do something about this and I'm sitting listening to the other issues in this audience feeling

771
01:01:03,666 --> 01:01:12,180
[SPEAKER_19]: that my issue is so trivial that I should just go pay my $10 and not bother your time because President, I do not envy your position.

772
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:14,704
[SPEAKER_19]: Sitting here for one evening, I do not envy your position.

773
01:01:15,165 --> 01:01:15,746
[SPEAKER_19]: But gentlemen,

774
01:01:16,985 --> 01:01:18,246
[SPEAKER_19]: Their issue is large.

775
01:01:18,346 --> 01:01:21,387
[SPEAKER_19]: My issue has become one that I've talked to many neighbors.

776
01:01:22,207 --> 01:01:27,730
[SPEAKER_19]: Many people don't want to step forward because they're fearing some type of retaliation from the city or the police are going to earmark them.

777
01:01:28,350 --> 01:01:34,773
[SPEAKER_19]: And I wouldn't have gone this far if I didn't get such a negative reaction from people about what our community could do.

778
01:01:34,793 --> 01:01:37,134
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't have any issue with enforcement.

779
01:01:37,214 --> 01:01:38,754
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't have any issue with the sticker.

780
01:01:38,774 --> 01:01:40,615
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't have any issue with all of it.

781
01:01:40,715 --> 01:01:44,457
[SPEAKER_19]: My only issue is that they charged me a month and a half

782
01:01:45,385 --> 01:01:50,796
[SPEAKER_19]: They charged me a month and a half when I should have had it for a year, and now I'm expected to buy a new one.

783
01:01:52,137 --> 01:02:02,823
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, and then, just so you are aware because you've been discussing this issue, I believe that ticket information is public knowledge, public information, that's what I thought.

784
01:02:03,303 --> 01:02:07,405
[SPEAKER_19]: I said to Jim, I have never seen anybody ticketing on the street.

785
01:02:07,945 --> 01:02:14,869
[SPEAKER_19]: Through November, through December, apparently there is a white box truck that Park Medford drives around in.

786
01:02:15,409 --> 01:02:21,152
[SPEAKER_19]: I talked to Pam on January 2nd and said, you know what, I can't pull in my driveway half the time because of the church.

787
01:02:21,548 --> 01:02:24,471
[SPEAKER_19]: I can't make the angle to get in because they're parked so close.

788
01:02:24,871 --> 01:02:26,172
[SPEAKER_19]: I deal with the church on that.

789
01:02:26,473 --> 01:02:27,374
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't want to bother you.

790
01:02:27,394 --> 01:02:29,235
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, there's certain things to not bother you with.

791
01:02:29,676 --> 01:02:31,437
[SPEAKER_19]: But he wouldn't produce any tickets.

792
01:02:31,938 --> 01:02:33,940
[SPEAKER_19]: And then he said, oh, there's been some written.

793
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:36,462
[SPEAKER_19]: And I said, listen, I've talked to many neighbours.

794
01:02:36,502 --> 01:02:39,985
[SPEAKER_19]: There have not been tickets issued November and December.

795
01:02:40,326 --> 01:02:41,367
[SPEAKER_19]: Jim says there have been.

796
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:44,590
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe there have been a few, but not for the issue of the permit.

797
01:02:45,010 --> 01:02:46,251
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm very discouraged.

798
01:02:46,431 --> 01:02:47,692
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm very sad by this.

799
01:02:47,712 --> 01:02:50,835
[SPEAKER_19]: I would really love somebody to do something.

800
01:02:51,155 --> 01:02:56,079
[SPEAKER_19]: For all of you, I'm grateful you're here and you're fighting your cause because your issue is a little bigger than mine.

801
01:02:56,439 --> 01:03:01,983
[SPEAKER_19]: But mine is on principle that I don't want to buy another parking sticker for a year when I just bought it in November.

802
01:03:02,904 --> 01:03:03,805
[SPEAKER_19]: So thank you, gentlemen.

803
01:03:04,125 --> 01:03:05,746
[SPEAKER_19]: And thank you.

804
01:03:11,371 --> 01:03:12,992
[SPEAKER_09]: The chair recognizes Councilor Scarpelli.

805
01:03:13,763 --> 01:03:14,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Linda, for coming out.

806
01:03:16,144 --> 01:03:21,505
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to, maybe publicly, I'll come over for dinner, invite those same six kids.

807
01:03:21,865 --> 01:03:25,126
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to come over and talk with them and get involved, okay?

808
01:03:25,766 --> 01:03:27,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, I can imagine.

809
01:03:27,326 --> 01:03:38,349
[SPEAKER_03]: But as we talk about these issues, I think one of the biggest things that we see, and I know that through your email and many emails, I think it's important that we talk about its transparency.

810
01:03:40,130 --> 01:03:41,710
[SPEAKER_03]: The lack of

811
01:03:42,395 --> 01:03:45,157
[SPEAKER_03]: of knowledge of what to do, where to go, who to talk to.

812
01:03:46,198 --> 01:03:47,078
[SPEAKER_03]: It's confusing.

813
01:03:47,559 --> 01:03:59,247
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a city councilman and I question myself as I read into this more and we talk about the parking process and the whole permit parking and where the equity comes into play.

814
01:03:59,808 --> 01:04:11,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Where in some neighborhoods where there's what was said earlier, parking permits that people are paying for but reliable, they don't have to go to that area because it's not

815
01:04:12,164 --> 01:04:12,464
[SPEAKER_03]: meet it.

816
01:04:12,744 --> 01:04:14,945
[SPEAKER_03]: So they don't need to enforce that area.

817
01:04:15,526 --> 01:04:21,289
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have friends that live right at the corner, actually right across the street from the, um, from the church.

818
01:04:21,329 --> 01:04:22,429
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that's a huge issue.

819
01:04:23,010 --> 01:04:40,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but again, I think this has to go back to, um, meeting, having follow up with Councilor Marks as, as stated earlier, and bringing this up at, at a, at a forum where these should all be talked about and put out and answered by both reliable, the police chief,

820
01:04:41,138 --> 01:04:47,167
[SPEAKER_03]: and a traffic commission so that we can get an understanding of the frustrations we hear.

821
01:04:47,307 --> 01:04:50,772
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this is, you know, I wrote a bunch of different questions.

822
01:04:51,272 --> 01:04:53,095
[SPEAKER_03]: After six, do we know that

823
01:04:54,270 --> 01:04:56,232
[SPEAKER_03]: What are the rules that after six and on the weekends?

824
01:04:56,853 --> 01:04:57,754
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that was brought up.

825
01:04:58,154 --> 01:04:58,915
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm so sorry.

826
01:04:59,275 --> 01:05:02,138
[SPEAKER_19]: I apologize for coming back up, but that was the other issue.

827
01:05:02,158 --> 01:05:02,518
[SPEAKER_19]: You're right.

828
01:05:02,598 --> 01:05:07,983
[SPEAKER_19]: I discovered that the Park Medford tickets Monday through Friday between eight and six.

829
01:05:08,003 --> 01:05:09,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, and the church is all weekend.

830
01:05:09,204 --> 01:05:11,446
[SPEAKER_19]: The church doesn't start till 630 at night.

831
01:05:11,566 --> 01:05:14,689
[SPEAKER_19]: Tuesday, Thursday, and even Friday, you can't even move.

832
01:05:14,729 --> 01:05:16,291
[SPEAKER_19]: So I had said that to Pam.

833
01:05:16,511 --> 01:05:19,554
[SPEAKER_19]: That was the first night I saw the Medford Parks

834
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:22,196
[SPEAKER_19]: And it was at five of six.

835
01:05:22,576 --> 01:05:23,557
[SPEAKER_19]: Nobody was at the church.

836
01:05:23,597 --> 01:05:25,338
[SPEAKER_19]: At 630, hundreds of people flew in.

837
01:05:25,659 --> 01:05:34,566
[SPEAKER_19]: And then when I talked to the police department, because I know people at the police department, the police will ticket only in the middle of the night, and they just want residents on the street.

838
01:05:34,606 --> 01:05:36,127
[SPEAKER_19]: So they're not ticketing for the church.

839
01:05:36,167 --> 01:05:37,668
[SPEAKER_19]: They're not ticketing on the weekend.

840
01:05:38,129 --> 01:05:40,271
[SPEAKER_19]: So that is another issue, with all due respect.

841
01:05:40,811 --> 01:05:47,236
[SPEAKER_03]: So as I move forward, again, I looked at your neighboring communities and how they do it.

842
01:05:48,588 --> 01:05:54,232
[SPEAKER_03]: having that centralized traffic and parking office, and having the hearing officer that you can actually talk to.

843
01:05:54,992 --> 01:06:05,158
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe it's not, you don't get the answer that you want, but at least you're talking to someone, the answer's final, and you're not running back and forth.

844
01:06:05,178 --> 01:06:07,320
[SPEAKER_03]: I can only imagine how frustrating that was.

845
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:15,945
[SPEAKER_03]: The other issue is we talk about permits and the revenue that the city creates through parking permits.

846
01:06:17,194 --> 01:06:20,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, does that mean Reliable now gets all of the permits?

847
01:06:20,738 --> 01:06:33,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that, maybe someone can enlighten me, Mr. President, but now that permits, when I lived in West Medford, the permits, we came to City Hall, purchased our parking permit, and that revenue came back to the city somehow.

848
01:06:34,391 --> 01:06:40,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, if this goes to Reliable, not only are they writing tickets, they're also making, are they making the revenue for the permits?

849
01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:57,845
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know the answer to that, uh, Councilor, but if you would like to amend this motion to get that question as part of the report that we've requested now for the second time, I'm sure that that information will be forthcoming within the coming century.

850
01:06:57,865 --> 01:06:58,466
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate that.

851
01:06:58,486 --> 01:07:06,188
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we can also add to that amendment, um, the, uh, better outline and who to address concerns.

852
01:07:06,628 --> 01:07:11,330
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I went online today, uh, and I went through the whole process you tried to go through and I found it

853
01:07:11,798 --> 01:07:13,059
[SPEAKER_03]: very disheartening.

854
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:26,324
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and again, this falls back and sitting in front of people that can answer these questions and having the stakeholders involved, which again, I'm going to revert back to Councilor Marks and his, his opinion with having that summit.

855
01:07:26,364 --> 01:07:34,527
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's going to be very important both for public knowledge and a little finalization here with some of these issues.

856
01:07:34,567 --> 01:07:41,110
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, I apologize that you had to go through such a ordeal and, and, but I can, I can see why so.

857
01:07:41,644 --> 01:07:42,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

858
01:07:42,845 --> 01:07:43,985
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor.

859
01:07:44,345 --> 01:07:54,070
[SPEAKER_10]: So on the motion of Councilor Caraviello, as amended by Councilor Scarpelli, the chair recognizes Madam Vice President Brianna Longo-Kerr.

860
01:07:54,190 --> 01:07:55,631
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

861
01:07:55,711 --> 01:07:57,232
[SPEAKER_18]: If I could ask Ms.

862
01:07:57,272 --> 01:08:04,075
[SPEAKER_18]: Kelly a question about when Marion Street got changed to permit parking.

863
01:08:04,795 --> 01:08:06,076
[SPEAKER_18]: Was that actually in November 2015?

864
01:08:06,136 --> 01:08:09,678
[SPEAKER_10]: Through the chair, you may ask any question you'd like.

865
01:08:12,474 --> 01:08:20,917
[SPEAKER_19]: We received the notice mid-October that the street was going permit parking by the middle of, by November 1st.

866
01:08:22,738 --> 01:08:25,779
[SPEAKER_19]: And I didn't even make it down until approximately the second week.

867
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:30,041
[SPEAKER_19]: And many neighbors didn't even go then because nobody was ticketing.

868
01:08:30,481 --> 01:08:35,443
[SPEAKER_18]: So obviously within that, so where did that notice come from that came from the traffic commission or?

869
01:08:35,704 --> 01:08:36,364
[SPEAKER_18]: Came from, was it?

870
01:08:38,543 --> 01:08:40,545
[SPEAKER_19]: No, it was the city.

871
01:08:41,345 --> 01:08:41,926
[SPEAKER_19]: City of Medford.

872
01:08:41,986 --> 01:08:49,291
[SPEAKER_19]: It was the city of Medford because they had mentioned, that's why I was going, that they were only responsible for sending out the letter.

873
01:08:49,612 --> 01:08:54,335
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what I was told, that they're not involved with what PAC, PARC, Medford policies are.

874
01:08:54,695 --> 01:09:00,540
[SPEAKER_18]: And within the letter it didn't mention anything with regards to time frames of when to get the permit and when you'll need to renew your permit?

875
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:00,800
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

876
01:09:01,582 --> 01:09:04,983
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, just as one councillor, I think that's where the problem lies.

877
01:09:05,003 --> 01:09:09,384
[SPEAKER_18]: Number one, we don't know where in the city of Medford you got that letter from.

878
01:09:09,824 --> 01:09:16,086
[SPEAKER_18]: Number two, the department that they got the letter from obviously did not educate you on the topic.

879
01:09:16,546 --> 01:09:20,227
[SPEAKER_18]: So we need to set policies that are gonna make sense.

880
01:09:20,307 --> 01:09:29,370
[SPEAKER_18]: So whether it be, like you said, prorated or just more education to the person who lives on Marion Street,

881
01:09:30,220 --> 01:09:32,582
[SPEAKER_18]: Even if you knew that, it might have made more sense.

882
01:09:32,642 --> 01:09:38,886
[SPEAKER_18]: You might have said to yourself, oh, I'll park in our driveway till January 1st, then I'll get my permit.

883
01:09:38,906 --> 01:09:40,087
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not going to go up there.

884
01:09:40,167 --> 01:09:41,888
[SPEAKER_18]: It's more, and I understand, it's not the money.

885
01:09:42,188 --> 01:09:48,853
[SPEAKER_18]: You have to go up, you have to, you know, fill out the documentation, write out a check, pay the $10, and then they want you to do it a month and a half later.

886
01:09:49,293 --> 01:09:51,054
[SPEAKER_18]: I think not knowing is the problem.

887
01:09:51,174 --> 01:09:55,057
[SPEAKER_18]: So we need to set policies and procedures that make sense.

888
01:09:59,158 --> 01:10:05,207
[SPEAKER_19]: And I will never say who that was because they were all very nice to me and were very excited I was fighting this.

889
01:10:05,628 --> 01:10:09,674
[SPEAKER_19]: But that was the phrase one of the employees used, that this is a money grab.

890
01:10:12,453 --> 01:10:12,793
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

891
01:10:12,953 --> 01:10:15,954
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'd also like to... Please state your name and address.

892
01:10:16,014 --> 01:10:19,414
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry, my name is Michael Pawinski, 23 Marion Street.

893
01:10:19,574 --> 01:10:20,895
[SPEAKER_17]: Welcome.

894
01:10:20,995 --> 01:10:25,115
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Scarpelli, I think you hit the nail on the head, is the transparency.

895
01:10:25,515 --> 01:10:29,876
[SPEAKER_17]: And Councilor Luongo-King, we don't know who's sending these.

896
01:10:29,936 --> 01:10:31,236
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't know who to go to.

897
01:10:31,276 --> 01:10:33,377
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't know who to fight this with.

898
01:10:33,497 --> 01:10:38,338
[SPEAKER_17]: And just a few answers is all we're asking for, that's all.

899
01:10:38,358 --> 01:10:39,458
[SPEAKER_17]: And I thank you for your time.

900
01:10:39,558 --> 01:10:40,458
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

901
01:10:42,013 --> 01:11:02,589
[SPEAKER_18]: I would request that anybody whose street changed to permit parking after mid-half of the year, so July 1st and on, that their new parking permit come 2016 be prorated, that they get, whether it's a half-price permit or that they get their money back for 2015.

902
01:11:03,089 --> 01:11:09,174
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we need to do something to set precedent to say we made a mistake and we need to make things right.

903
01:11:09,699 --> 01:11:27,443
[SPEAKER_18]: I also think that those letters that go out, once a street turns into permit parking, which I believe comes from the Traffic Commission, we need to set the precedent to let the public know, let our residents know, this is the procedure, this is when you have to get your parking permit, and this is when you're going to have to renew your parking permit.

904
01:11:28,143 --> 01:11:28,923
[SPEAKER_18]: It just makes sense.

905
01:11:29,783 --> 01:11:34,544
[SPEAKER_18]: Like Councilor Scarpelli said, transparency, educating the public.

906
01:11:34,924 --> 01:11:38,905
[SPEAKER_18]: If people know what to expect, it isn't a shocker, it isn't a pain.

907
01:11:39,318 --> 01:11:40,359
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, people understand.

908
01:11:40,399 --> 01:11:41,499
[SPEAKER_18]: They can make arrangements.

909
01:11:41,839 --> 01:11:45,742
[SPEAKER_18]: But to — this — it's just so frustrating.

910
01:11:46,622 --> 01:11:47,723
[SPEAKER_18]: It really is frustrating.

911
01:11:48,343 --> 01:11:54,106
[SPEAKER_18]: And I — and I hope — you know, we — I think the administration is going to make these changes and many, many more.

912
01:11:54,466 --> 01:12:04,932
[SPEAKER_18]: I know it's only been three and a half, four weeks, but I hope these changes come sooner than later so that these minuscule things that frustrate people to no end can be resolved.

913
01:12:05,332 --> 01:12:06,193
[SPEAKER_10]: The President Thank you very much.

914
01:12:09,028 --> 01:12:11,049
[SPEAKER_10]: The chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

915
01:12:12,310 --> 01:12:13,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

916
01:12:13,351 --> 01:12:14,412
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to thank Ms.

917
01:12:14,432 --> 01:12:16,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Kelly for coming up here tonight.

918
01:12:16,813 --> 01:12:25,479
[SPEAKER_04]: I can feel your frustration on this and I'm a little surprised by the response you got from the police department.

919
01:12:25,559 --> 01:12:37,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Chief Sacco has been the face of this program and anyone that would be involved in implementing policy change or having some involvement in this would be Chief Sacco and the police department.

920
01:12:38,161 --> 01:12:40,502
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it's not him, it would be the mayor's office.

921
01:12:41,602 --> 01:12:46,684
[SPEAKER_04]: So for them to say they have no involvement in it, I really find that troubling.

922
01:12:47,884 --> 01:12:56,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Because as Councilor Lungo-Koehn just mentioned, this is an easy fix to either prorate a ticket or come up with a better solution.

923
01:12:57,488 --> 01:13:06,351
[SPEAKER_04]: I realize the permit parking stickers change colors, and that's why they have to issue new stickers every year.

924
01:13:06,845 --> 01:13:11,706
[SPEAKER_04]: And for a period of time, they weren't even issuing stickers because of an issue.

925
01:13:12,306 --> 01:13:19,388
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, there was an issue with people going out to a nightclub and being followed home because the sticker had your address on it at one point.

926
01:13:19,968 --> 01:13:22,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and so they changed the whole process.

927
01:13:22,609 --> 01:13:31,071
[SPEAKER_04]: And now they went back to stickers because it was hard for a resident who would look outside their home and say, this car's been out here for three days.

928
01:13:31,511 --> 01:13:35,912
[SPEAKER_04]: If it didn't have a sticker, you assumed that they weren't permit parking.

929
01:13:36,441 --> 01:13:38,982
[SPEAKER_04]: But when they did away with the stickers, there was no way of assuming that.

930
01:13:39,342 --> 01:13:40,903
[SPEAKER_04]: So, that's why they went back to the stickers.

931
01:13:40,983 --> 01:13:45,525
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think 99.9 percent of this is just common sense.

932
01:13:46,186 --> 01:13:52,609
[SPEAKER_04]: If I was the head of Park Method and someone came in, like yourself, and came in and said, we just had our street changed over in October.

933
01:13:52,969 --> 01:13:54,890
[SPEAKER_04]: I just got the sticker in November.

934
01:13:55,270 --> 01:13:57,991
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't realize I had to up it and I got a ticket in January.

935
01:13:58,632 --> 01:14:04,495
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just basic common sense as a manager, as an administrator that would say, you know what?

936
01:14:04,775 --> 01:14:05,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me the ticket.

937
01:14:05,773 --> 01:14:06,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't worry about it.

938
01:14:06,893 --> 01:14:08,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell your neighbors, don't worry about it.

939
01:14:09,274 --> 01:14:16,416
[SPEAKER_04]: There's this, you know.

940
01:14:16,436 --> 01:14:21,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's good to hear that he wiped out the tickets, but I think it's just common sense.

941
01:14:22,597 --> 01:14:29,599
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we lose touch in this day and age with all everything electronic and, you know, the face-to-face is gone now.

942
01:14:30,199 --> 01:14:34,560
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's unfortunate that an issue like this that could be resolved in a second

943
01:14:35,278 --> 01:14:41,482
[SPEAKER_04]: You had to take so many hours to go talk to the mayor's office and the chief and come up here that could have been resolved immediately.

944
01:14:42,183 --> 01:14:58,014
[SPEAKER_04]: And as Councilor Knight mentioned, the chief said he was working on creating a citywide resident permit parking system, in effect, that may be by wards, by precinct, that stickers issued.

945
01:14:59,154 --> 01:15:04,318
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know they've been working on that for some time, and I'm hoping that comes about because

946
01:15:05,032 --> 01:15:09,013
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no reason why certain streets have resident permit parking and other streets don't.

947
01:15:09,913 --> 01:15:11,274
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can only park on your street.

948
01:15:11,294 --> 01:15:13,234
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't park on the next street over.

949
01:15:14,075 --> 01:15:18,456
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so there's a lot of issues that need to be addressed, but I appreciate you coming up here tonight.

950
01:15:18,496 --> 01:15:22,897
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not sure what we can, it is a policy decision.

951
01:15:23,517 --> 01:15:33,140
[SPEAKER_04]: And to me, there should be a policy out there that states, you know, as Councilor Longo said, maybe if you get a ticket, a sticker six months into the,

952
01:15:33,533 --> 01:15:45,443
[SPEAKER_04]: to the year, they prorate it, or they give you a sheet with your sticker saying, don't forget, this runs out, begins January 1st, runs out December 31st.

953
01:15:45,884 --> 01:15:47,685
[SPEAKER_04]: And that way you're on the hook if something happens.

954
01:15:47,725 --> 01:15:49,046
[SPEAKER_04]: At least they notified you.

955
01:15:49,907 --> 01:15:52,289
[SPEAKER_04]: So I appreciate you coming up tonight.

956
01:15:53,070 --> 01:15:54,030
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Knox.

957
01:15:54,291 --> 01:15:55,752
[SPEAKER_10]: Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

958
01:15:56,203 --> 01:15:57,464
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

959
01:15:57,544 --> 01:16:12,814
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to amend the paper before us by way of a B paper that would read, Mr. President, whereas Marion Street became permit parking in November in the 2015 permit parking stickers were valid only for six weeks, that these permits maintain their validity through the end of 2016.

960
01:16:12,854 --> 01:16:22,420
[SPEAKER_06]: Name is Nick Tomaszuk, 29 Garfield Ave.

961
01:16:25,404 --> 01:16:31,647
[SPEAKER_06]: Not to get off of what I'm trying to say, but they could have issued the next year's pocket sticker.

962
01:16:32,047 --> 01:16:34,208
[SPEAKER_06]: That would have avoided the whole problem that she had.

963
01:16:37,150 --> 01:16:42,692
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, yeah, but I'm saying when she went up in November, give her the 2016 sticker.

964
01:16:43,853 --> 01:16:44,714
[SPEAKER_06]: It's only two months.

965
01:16:45,854 --> 01:16:47,595
[SPEAKER_06]: It would have eliminated so many problems.

966
01:16:48,796 --> 01:16:51,517
[SPEAKER_06]: But my point is, is the biggest

967
01:16:51,873 --> 01:16:59,299
[SPEAKER_06]: The big parking problem is these people that park on these side streets and get on the bus to go to Haymarket.

968
01:17:00,780 --> 01:17:02,161
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of that going around.

969
01:17:04,763 --> 01:17:13,710
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, so if you give, you know, like a resident, like Medford resident sticker, that would avoid some of those problems.

970
01:17:14,631 --> 01:17:18,614
[SPEAKER_06]: Because there's like multi-families on my street, so everybody owns a couple of cars.

971
01:17:19,707 --> 01:17:21,608
[SPEAKER_06]: So a triple deck is going to have six cars.

972
01:17:21,628 --> 01:17:23,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Where are you going to put them all?

973
01:17:23,988 --> 01:17:25,448
[SPEAKER_06]: The street's only a block long.

974
01:17:25,929 --> 01:17:32,290
[SPEAKER_06]: And they still find a space to put their cars there and get on a 326 bus to go into the Haymarket.

975
01:17:33,471 --> 01:17:36,011
[SPEAKER_06]: So there has to be some kind of a system to stop it.

976
01:17:37,011 --> 01:17:39,452
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they could pay and park right here and get on the bus.

977
01:17:40,692 --> 01:17:42,473
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's better to park on the side street.

978
01:17:43,726 --> 01:17:44,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Feel free.

979
01:17:46,088 --> 01:17:46,669
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

980
01:17:47,209 --> 01:17:47,610
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

981
01:17:47,990 --> 01:17:48,991
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you all very much.

982
01:17:49,091 --> 01:17:57,619
[SPEAKER_10]: So on the motion for approval on the B paper offered by Councilor Knight, all those in favor.

983
01:17:57,939 --> 01:18:00,501
[SPEAKER_10]: Roll call vote has been requested on the B paper.

984
01:18:03,684 --> 01:18:06,127
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Clerk, if you could read the amendments.

985
01:18:15,273 --> 01:18:15,413
[SPEAKER_10]: Huh?

986
01:18:15,433 --> 01:18:16,894
[SPEAKER_10]: I understood that.

987
01:18:17,134 --> 01:18:24,156
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, then let's take the- Well, Councilor Knights is all- Let's take the- All the Marion Street parking for 2015 be carried over to 2016.

988
01:18:24,276 --> 01:18:29,498
[SPEAKER_09]: We're gonna do the B paper first, and then we'll have the amendments on the A paper.

989
01:18:29,778 --> 01:18:37,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli is requiring who receives the revenue on the parking permits.

990
01:18:41,283 --> 01:18:44,024
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have the Traffic Commission,

991
01:18:46,177 --> 01:18:47,858
[SPEAKER_09]: set up a policy that makes sense.

992
01:18:48,118 --> 01:19:07,424
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's kind of a little vague.

993
01:19:07,584 --> 01:19:14,907
[SPEAKER_18]: If the Traffic Commission can look into policy changes when notifying residents of their need to get permit parking stickers.

994
01:19:18,770 --> 01:19:34,334
[SPEAKER_18]: clarifying when they need to be purchased by, when the renewal date is, and also looking into a system to prorate the charge, especially if you're over six months into the year.

995
01:19:40,556 --> 01:19:41,516
[SPEAKER_10]: Anything else, Mr. Clerk?

996
01:19:42,576 --> 01:19:42,836
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

997
01:19:43,257 --> 01:19:43,677
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

998
01:19:44,297 --> 01:19:46,357
[SPEAKER_10]: On the B paper offered by Councilor Knight.

999
01:19:46,858 --> 01:19:48,118

01:20:16,831 --> 01:20:17,992
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1017
01:20:20,454 --> 01:20:22,015
[SPEAKER_10]: You do want a roll call on that, yes?

1018
01:20:24,536 --> 01:20:25,077
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll take one.

1019

[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1037
01:20:54,132 --> 01:20:56,232
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to wish Mr. Drennan a happy birthday.

1038
01:20:56,739 --> 01:21:02,761
[SPEAKER_05]: I think he's the second oldest councillor in Medford next to Councilor McGlynn.

1039
01:21:03,162 --> 01:21:03,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.

1040
01:21:03,902 --> 01:21:06,083
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to wish him happy birthday wishes, fam.

1041
01:21:06,623 --> 01:21:08,824
[SPEAKER_05]: So, birthday wishes to the councillor.

1042
01:21:09,164 --> 01:21:10,024
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favour?

1043
01:21:10,624 --> 01:21:11,325
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

1044
01:21:12,105 --> 01:21:13,145
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion carries.

1045
01:21:15,626 --> 01:21:19,808
[SPEAKER_10]: While we're under suspension, there's a citizen that wants to speak to us on an unknown topic.

1046
01:21:24,987 --> 01:21:27,009
[SPEAKER_10]: Please state your name and address for the record, ma'am.

1047
01:21:27,049 --> 01:21:29,310
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm Valerie Washburn, Medford, Massachusetts.

1048
01:21:31,812 --> 01:21:38,996
[SPEAKER_13]: First, I'd like to thank the city council people who have been of great help to me, Rick Caraviello, in the past.

1049
01:21:39,917 --> 01:21:44,340
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm here tonight with the encouragement of Michael Marks and Brianna.

1050
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:49,583
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is my first time doing this presentation, so I hope you'll be patient with me.

1051
01:21:51,364 --> 01:21:52,705
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's see, I forgot my glasses.

1052
01:21:53,815 --> 01:21:54,075
[SPEAKER_13]: I got it.

1053
01:21:54,155 --> 01:21:54,475
[SPEAKER_13]: I got it.

1054
01:21:54,556 --> 01:21:56,316
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1055
01:21:57,297 --> 01:21:58,797
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, OK.

1056
01:21:59,037 --> 01:21:59,838
[SPEAKER_13]: You want me to repeat?

1057
01:22:03,359 --> 01:22:03,599
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.

1058
01:22:03,819 --> 01:22:05,020
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you want me to repeat something?

1059
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:07,080
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.

1060
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:12,703
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1061
01:22:12,743 --> 01:22:20,346
[SPEAKER_13]: First, I'd like to say that I had met a number of citizens who tell me that I want to read what I have here.

1062
01:22:23,097 --> 01:22:30,261
[SPEAKER_13]: some citizens that told me that they put on their PJs, get some hot chocolate, and settle down to watch the council meeting on TV.

1063
01:22:31,021 --> 01:22:32,962
[SPEAKER_13]: And I want to say, come on down.

1064
01:22:33,482 --> 01:22:39,565
[SPEAKER_13]: We need more Medford citizens to participate in our government meetings.

1065
01:22:40,646 --> 01:22:41,766
[SPEAKER_13]: So, come on down.

1066
01:22:42,927 --> 01:22:49,410
[SPEAKER_13]: And meet our very, very kind and lovely city councilors.

1067
01:22:50,311 --> 01:22:56,235
[SPEAKER_13]: And our reporter, who's not here tonight, reports for the transcript, Alex.

1068
01:22:57,575 --> 01:23:07,521
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, so one of the people interested in what I'm going to talk about decided to write me an abbreviated copy.

1069
01:23:08,122 --> 01:23:11,544
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'll read that first of what my focus is going to be tonight.

1070
01:23:13,045 --> 01:23:15,286
[SPEAKER_13]: Duties of Oak Grove Cemetery Trustees.

1071
01:23:16,187 --> 01:23:18,228
[SPEAKER_13]: How do we create an advisory board

1072
01:23:18,905 --> 01:23:20,746
[SPEAKER_13]: made up of Medford citizens.

1073
01:23:22,087 --> 01:23:23,268
[SPEAKER_13]: Questions from Mark Rumbly.

1074
01:23:23,468 --> 01:23:25,530
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there an open meeting law requirement?

1075
01:23:26,270 --> 01:23:31,674
[SPEAKER_13]: Can any decisions be made privately behind closed doors that the public cannot attend by the cemetery trustees?

1076
01:23:32,535 --> 01:23:35,196
[SPEAKER_13]: There should be no lack of transparency in the deliberations.

1077
01:23:36,157 --> 01:23:38,699
[SPEAKER_13]: What are city laws, state laws regarding cemetery?

1078
01:23:39,059 --> 01:23:41,601
[SPEAKER_13]: What are the bylaws regarding the cemetery usage?

1079
01:23:44,730 --> 01:23:53,259
[SPEAKER_13]: If there is an open position for a cemetery trustee, which I believe there's one that's coming up in March, how does one apply?

1080
01:23:53,459 --> 01:23:54,701
[SPEAKER_13]: Who makes the final decision?

1081
01:23:55,782 --> 01:24:00,266
[SPEAKER_13]: What is the appeal process if a decision made by the trustees is not acceptable?

1082
01:24:03,323 --> 01:24:10,305
[SPEAKER_13]: Massachusetts general laws do not prohibit green and natural burials, which is something I'm going to be talking a little bit about.

1083
01:24:10,806 --> 01:24:15,227
[SPEAKER_13]: Green burials do not cause disease to anyone or problems for the cemetery.

1084
01:24:17,248 --> 01:24:20,069
[SPEAKER_13]: Oak Grove Cemetery is contiguous with Brooks Estate land.

1085
01:24:20,369 --> 01:24:24,310
[SPEAKER_13]: Groundwater from the cemetery must at times drain into Brooks Estate land.

1086
01:24:24,771 --> 01:24:27,011
[SPEAKER_13]: Brooks Estate is a protected conservation area.

1087
01:24:27,451 --> 01:24:31,733
[SPEAKER_13]: Therefore, we should allow burials that are 100% conservation conscious.

1088
01:24:33,735 --> 01:24:41,378
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so that was an abbreviated script, and I would like you now to please listen to mine.

1089
01:24:41,578 --> 01:24:52,763
[SPEAKER_13]: And I only have a rough draft because this wasn't decided until last night, and I just really have not time to make it more concise.

1090
01:24:53,023 --> 01:24:55,604
[SPEAKER_13]: So I apologize, but I hope you won't find it boring.

1091
01:24:58,690 --> 01:25:07,232
[SPEAKER_13]: The concerns I bring to the council meeting tonight is a focus on preservation and fairness to all, especially related to the burial at Oak Grove Cemetery.

1092
01:25:08,893 --> 01:25:14,654
[SPEAKER_13]: First, I tell you I have spent much of my life here in Medford, as many of my relatives have.

1093
01:25:15,614 --> 01:25:17,775
[SPEAKER_13]: I attended grade school through high school in Medford.

1094
01:25:18,315 --> 01:25:21,076
[SPEAKER_13]: I've attended services at almost every church and synagogue.

1095
01:25:21,836 --> 01:25:25,537
[SPEAKER_13]: And I've attended classes and functions and used the libraries at Tufts College.

1096
01:25:26,274 --> 01:25:33,136
[SPEAKER_13]: My husband and I have worked as substitute teachers in the Medford school system, and we've done other assignments as well.

1097
01:25:35,017 --> 01:25:49,942
[SPEAKER_13]: Tonight, I bring attention to our concern for our historic and beautiful cemetery, Oak Grove Cemetery, and the Brooks Estate, which lies side by side in West Medford, and both border the large pond in the Brooks Estate.

1098
01:25:51,211 --> 01:25:58,418
[SPEAKER_13]: I bring before you several urgent questions a growing number of Medford citizens and taxpayers have been asking.

1099
01:26:00,159 --> 01:26:07,706
[SPEAKER_13]: One is the question of use at Oak Grove Cemetery for burial by the citizens of Medford.

1100
01:26:09,688 --> 01:26:17,035
[SPEAKER_13]: My understanding is the cemetery's decisions are made by a group of three trustees selected by the mayor

1101
01:26:17,479 --> 01:26:19,360
[SPEAKER_13]: and perhaps other elected officials.

1102
01:26:20,041 --> 01:26:26,725
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a cemetery manager who manages and directs the affairs of Oak Grove, but does not have a vote with the trustees.

1103
01:26:27,486 --> 01:26:35,751
[SPEAKER_13]: The cemetery is regulated by Mass General Laws, MGL, Massachusetts, which are Massachusetts state laws, and local laws.

1104
01:26:36,532 --> 01:26:45,678
[SPEAKER_13]: There are bylaws the cemetery follows, which can and should be examined and perhaps changed to suit the various needs of Medford residents.

1105
01:26:47,845 --> 01:26:48,826
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you hear me okay, Rick?

1106
01:26:49,926 --> 01:26:50,527
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you hear me now?

1107
01:26:51,267 --> 01:27:00,813
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1108
01:27:00,913 --> 01:27:05,276
[SPEAKER_13]: These are some of the questions we asked tonight, and there will be more to come.

1109
01:27:06,437 --> 01:27:14,662
[SPEAKER_13]: It has been suggested that an advisory board be established from among concerned residents to reflect the various needs and choices in burial preferences.

1110
01:27:15,523 --> 01:27:21,809
[SPEAKER_13]: We asked that an advisory board be established and we wondered if that can be done tonight.

1111
01:27:23,450 --> 01:27:34,260
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a requirement of open meeting laws to be held, open meeting laws to be held in public or can the trustees deliberate on their own and make private decisions?

1112
01:27:34,676 --> 01:27:36,297
[SPEAKER_13]: without input from the taxpayers?

1113
01:27:37,197 --> 01:27:46,360
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there an appeal process if the trustees vote against a request made by an owner of a gravesite and or by a Medford citizen who wishes to purchase a grave?

1114
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:53,302
[SPEAKER_13]: We understand many of the questions may be answered by our city solicitor, Mark Rumley.

1115
01:27:54,882 --> 01:28:14,552
[SPEAKER_13]: Residents with green burial concerns had a meeting with Attorney Rumley, who was asked about the laws regarding the personal choice of citizens who desire to have what is known as a green or natural burial, which does not use toxins involved in embalming and cremation and cement vaults.

1116
01:28:15,460 --> 01:28:23,085
[SPEAKER_13]: This is especially relevant to a growing awareness of preservation of health for people of all faiths and all living things.

1117
01:28:23,965 --> 01:28:30,249
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, the process of embalming and cremation is a choice many wish to avoid for personal and faith reasons.

1118
01:28:32,675 --> 01:28:41,617
[SPEAKER_13]: Mark Rumley stated under MGL laws, Mass General Laws, that Oak Grove Cemetery would be allowed to offer natural or green burials.

1119
01:28:42,077 --> 01:28:45,617
[SPEAKER_13]: There is nothing to stop them except their vote in favor of it.

1120
01:28:46,337 --> 01:28:53,879
[SPEAKER_13]: There is nothing in MGL's Mass General Laws to prevent Oak Grove from offering this as a choice to those who wish for this type of burial.

1121
01:28:54,419 --> 01:29:01,180
[SPEAKER_13]: We ask that an area suitable for this type of burial would be offered to those in Medford

1122
01:29:01,540 --> 01:29:03,821
[SPEAKER_13]: who desire it for personal or faith reasons.

1123
01:29:04,421 --> 01:29:12,623
[SPEAKER_13]: We ask the City Council to make this an urgent concern for a large aging population here, of which I am one, and for unexpected deaths.

1124
01:29:13,483 --> 01:29:15,704
[SPEAKER_13]: This is known as death care.

1125
01:29:17,865 --> 01:29:24,867
[SPEAKER_13]: Local community cemeteries in Arlington and Melrose and elsewhere are working to make green or natural burials a reality.

1126
01:29:25,947 --> 01:29:29,088
[SPEAKER_13]: It would be wonderful if the City of Medford showed this concern

1127
01:29:29,490 --> 01:29:37,655
[SPEAKER_13]: for the fast-growing movement of natural burials from Medford residents who are asking for it and want to be buried in their hometown.

1128
01:29:43,258 --> 01:29:48,842
[SPEAKER_13]: Jean just asked me, when she heard me, what I was going to talk about, what about the health concerns?

1129
01:29:49,282 --> 01:29:51,403
[SPEAKER_13]: And she thought that was a question many would have.

1130
01:29:52,764 --> 01:29:58,868
[SPEAKER_13]: We had a meeting with the cemetery board, let's see, a few weeks ago, and we had a speaker

1131
01:29:59,358 --> 01:30:08,404
[SPEAKER_13]: who is an expert in this field, who works at Mount Auburn Cemetery, a private cemetery in Cambridge, and she's a horticulturist.

1132
01:30:09,325 --> 01:30:14,848
[SPEAKER_13]: She explained how there is no disease concern from natural burials.

1133
01:30:15,108 --> 01:30:21,693
[SPEAKER_13]: In fact, there's more concern from unnatural burials, which would be the other types of burials that I mentioned.

1134
01:30:23,654 --> 01:30:28,237
[SPEAKER_13]: And so that's a concern many people have, and it's not really a reality.

1135
01:30:28,674 --> 01:30:29,594
[SPEAKER_13]: to be concerned about.

1136
01:30:30,354 --> 01:30:32,175
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that's all I have.

1137
01:30:33,015 --> 01:30:34,615
[SPEAKER_10]: You have a minute left, ma'am.

1138
01:30:34,895 --> 01:30:35,315
[SPEAKER_13]: Excuse me?

1139
01:30:35,475 --> 01:30:36,316
[SPEAKER_10]: You have a minute left.

1140
01:30:36,336 --> 01:30:36,816
[SPEAKER_13]: A minute left.

1141
01:30:36,916 --> 01:30:39,356
[SPEAKER_13]: I have some green burial literature here.

1142
01:30:39,736 --> 01:30:44,097
[SPEAKER_13]: It's very easy to find on Google and YouTube.

1143
01:30:44,858 --> 01:30:49,258
[SPEAKER_13]: There's tons of interest and tons of information.

1144
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:56,040
[SPEAKER_13]: I think I put my mic off.

1145
01:30:59,043 --> 01:30:59,383
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1146
01:31:01,845 --> 01:31:02,305
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that.

1147
01:31:02,926 --> 01:31:03,466
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Ralph.

1148
01:31:05,507 --> 01:31:06,348
[SPEAKER_18]: Will there be any questions?

1149
01:31:06,388 --> 01:31:08,249
[SPEAKER_10]: Chair recognizes Vice President Longo-Khan.

1150
01:31:08,509 --> 01:31:10,131
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

1151
01:31:10,211 --> 01:31:20,678
[SPEAKER_18]: I think this is probably a question for the administration as the question went before the administration with regards to setting up an advisory board for the Veterans Affairs.

1152
01:31:21,218 --> 01:31:22,319
[SPEAKER_18]: So what you're asking is,

1153
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:26,261
[SPEAKER_18]: whether or not that's something maybe the city administration would do.

1154
01:31:27,201 --> 01:31:41,944
[SPEAKER_18]: So if we could ask our new administration if this is a possibility or if they could also look into this while they're looking into other advisory committees within the city, setting up additional advisory committees I never think is a bad thing.

1155
01:31:42,284 --> 01:31:47,945
[SPEAKER_18]: And I know you spoke about a number of different issues that I think an advisory committee would probably look into, research.

1156
01:31:48,786 --> 01:31:54,270
[SPEAKER_18]: and hopefully develop ideas and bring them to the mayor and to the board of trustees, which is a three-person board.

1157
01:31:54,630 --> 01:31:56,111
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think it's a valid question.

1158
01:31:56,151 --> 01:32:04,337
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's something that may help alleviate and figure out a number of different issues that, you know, you obviously are well educated on.

1159
01:32:04,697 --> 01:32:10,241
[SPEAKER_18]: And I don't think it's going to hurt to ask the administration what her thoughts are and to see if we can possibly implement one.

1160
01:32:10,641 --> 01:32:15,945
[SPEAKER_18]: So I would ask the administration to look into that, see if it's a possibility, if it's something that would work.

1161
01:32:17,020 --> 01:32:24,426
[SPEAKER_18]: We have, like I said, the three-person board, so it always helps to have a number of different people looking into different issues that have to do with the cemetery.

1162
01:32:24,506 --> 01:32:25,507
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a large cemetery.

1163
01:32:25,547 --> 01:32:26,848
[SPEAKER_18]: We have a number of issues there.

1164
01:32:27,628 --> 01:32:40,618
[SPEAKER_18]: I know this week I came across an issue, and I spoke to Steve Dunn at the cemetery department, and your question with regards to appeals is, yes, once a decision is made, you can appeal, but you're appealing back to the board.

1165
01:32:41,301 --> 01:32:54,149
[SPEAKER_18]: So that might be something an advisory board can look into as well to maybe make some changes on that, because that almost seems like you have a three-person board that's making a decision, and your only appeals process is back to that three-member board.

1166
01:32:54,530 --> 01:32:57,271
[SPEAKER_18]: So that could run into some questions and some issues.

1167
01:32:57,291 --> 01:32:57,572
[SPEAKER_13]: Conflicts.

1168
01:32:57,832 --> 01:32:58,472
[SPEAKER_13]: Some conflicts.

1169
01:32:59,033 --> 01:33:02,655
[SPEAKER_18]: So I did get that answer, happened to get that answer this week.

1170
01:33:03,115 --> 01:33:07,318
[SPEAKER_18]: But I think it's a good resolve, and maybe our mayor can look into it.

1171
01:33:10,269 --> 01:33:12,049
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you make a resolution, Madam Vice President?

1172
01:33:12,790 --> 01:33:13,010
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1173
01:33:13,030 --> 01:33:16,311
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't get all that content that you were talking about.

1174
01:33:17,191 --> 01:33:18,371
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I'm not asking for the content.

1175
01:33:18,391 --> 01:33:19,831
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just asking it just like we asked.

1176
01:33:19,851 --> 01:33:21,072
[SPEAKER_10]: She can't make a resolution.

1177
01:33:21,132 --> 01:33:22,452
[SPEAKER_10]: Only the council can make the resolution.

1178
01:33:22,472 --> 01:33:23,572
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm making the resolution.

1179
01:33:23,612 --> 01:33:28,774
[SPEAKER_18]: Can the mayor look into a possibility of an advisory commission to the cemetery?

1180
01:33:30,094 --> 01:33:31,254
[SPEAKER_09]: For the cemetery board?

1181
01:33:31,854 --> 01:33:33,835
[SPEAKER_18]: For the board of trustees, an advisory committee.

1182
01:33:38,420 --> 01:33:39,741
[SPEAKER_10]: Chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

1183
01:33:40,322 --> 01:33:41,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1184
01:33:41,203 --> 01:33:46,067
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank Valerie for coming up tonight on these very important issues.

1185
01:33:47,248 --> 01:34:02,903
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a brief discussion with Mark Rumley in the subcommittee meeting before this regular scheduled council meeting, and he thought it was best, if Councilor Longo doesn't mind, that we send the paper directly to him regarding how an advisory committee is set up.

1186
01:34:03,696 --> 01:34:05,897
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's prepared to answer that question.

1187
01:34:06,777 --> 01:34:10,179
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we could just amend that to send it to the city solicitor.

1188
01:34:10,479 --> 01:34:11,960
[SPEAKER_04]: So that would be number one, Mr. Clerk.

1189
01:34:13,980 --> 01:34:16,101
[SPEAKER_04]: The creation of advisory board for the cemetery.

1190
01:34:16,882 --> 01:34:19,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, Valerie mentioned about the open meeting law.

1191
01:34:19,903 --> 01:34:26,366
[SPEAKER_04]: They required to adhere to all the requirements of the state open meeting law.

1192
01:34:27,126 --> 01:34:31,928
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sure Mark, city solicitor, will respond back to that.

1193
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:33,661
[SPEAKER_04]: and the appeal process.

1194
01:34:34,021 --> 01:34:45,225
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Councilor Longo might have answered it, but maybe if we could see within the Cemetery Board of Trustees' own policy and regulations where that language exists, there may be a timeframe on that.

1195
01:34:45,525 --> 01:34:47,226
[SPEAKER_04]: You might only have 10 days to appeal.

1196
01:34:47,246 --> 01:34:55,829
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure, but if we can get that appeal process language from the city solicitor, that would be helpful also, Mr. President.

1197
01:34:57,030 --> 01:35:00,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Valerie was nice enough not to get into the whole issue,

1198
01:35:01,425 --> 01:35:05,367
[SPEAKER_04]: about a request that went before the Board of Trustees, Mr. President.

1199
01:35:05,727 --> 01:35:16,110
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, it goes back to, in my opinion, you can have all the policies you want set up, but some of it has to do with what's in your heart and common sense.

1200
01:35:16,770 --> 01:35:19,011
[SPEAKER_04]: And this goes back to a family that was in this city.

1201
01:35:19,051 --> 01:35:20,171
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't get into the whole story.

1202
01:35:20,571 --> 01:35:28,714
[SPEAKER_04]: A family that lived in this city for 30 years, bought four plots for the husband, the wife, and I believe it was the grandparents.

1203
01:35:29,232 --> 01:35:37,534
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a tragic situation where their son passed away as a freshman in college, and they used one of the plots to bury their son.

1204
01:35:38,655 --> 01:35:50,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Since then, the husband passed away, the grandparents passed away, and this particular woman, who moved out of the city, although she was here for 30 years, went to the Board of Trustees and said, please, I want to be buried with my family.

1205
01:35:50,558 --> 01:35:52,118
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't the way it was supposed to work out.

1206
01:35:52,138 --> 01:35:57,240
[SPEAKER_04]: We brought four plots for us, but my son passed away, and they denied that, Mr. President.

1207
01:35:57,700 --> 01:35:58,980
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think some of this is just

1208
01:35:59,424 --> 01:36:00,864
[SPEAKER_04]: common sense, Mr. President.

1209
01:36:00,904 --> 01:36:07,085
[SPEAKER_04]: But, again, you know, rules and regulations are great, but I think you have to use some common sense.

1210
01:36:07,465 --> 01:36:20,708
[SPEAKER_04]: And regarding the green burial, all we need to do, from my understanding, is create a green burial policy within the Oak Grove Cemetery that would allow a portion of the cemetery to be used for green burial.

1211
01:36:21,248 --> 01:36:25,609
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's happening now, as was mentioned, across the state and other states.

1212
01:36:26,149 --> 01:36:27,609
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a wave of the future.

1213
01:36:28,376 --> 01:36:36,818
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see why, you know, that wouldn't be something that at least should be entertained, and the Board of Trustees do their home, their own homework on that, Mr. President.

1214
01:36:37,178 --> 01:36:41,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I'd like to thank Valerie for coming up on this very important subject.

1215
01:36:41,659 --> 01:36:47,180
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion approved by Councilor Marks, Councilor Lungo-Koehn, as amended by Councilor Marks.

1216
01:36:47,240 --> 01:36:47,960
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

1217
01:36:48,380 --> 01:36:49,581
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

1218
01:36:49,601 --> 01:36:50,401
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion carries.

1219
01:36:50,921 --> 01:36:54,302
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion of Vice President Lungo-Koehn to revert back to the regular audit business.

1220
01:36:54,362 --> 01:36:55,082
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

1221
01:36:55,502 --> 01:36:56,282
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

1222
01:36:57,811 --> 01:37:03,374
[SPEAKER_10]: uh, 16-041 to the honorable president and members of the Medford city council, et cetera.

1223
01:37:03,774 --> 01:37:11,399
[SPEAKER_10]: I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body returned to the sale of real estate at the amount of 201,001,064 and seven cents.

1224
01:37:11,419 --> 01:37:17,503
[SPEAKER_10]: This represents the amount received from a state grant plus the surplus not spent

1225
01:37:24,117 --> 01:37:38,179
[SPEAKER_10]: from the original appropriation for the Magoon Park Rehabilitation Project, a memo from the city finance directors attached, along with a copy of council paper 14-509 for your review.

1226
01:37:38,240 --> 01:37:42,880
[SPEAKER_10]: We received this all in our packets on Friday.

1227
01:37:43,780 --> 01:37:45,021
[SPEAKER_07]: Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

1228
01:37:45,701 --> 01:37:52,302
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, this paper dates back to June of 2014 when Mayor McGlynn put a paper before the council asking for an appropriation.

1229
01:37:53,010 --> 01:37:53,370
[SPEAKER_07]: of $292.

1230
01:37:53,691 --> 01:38:08,322
[SPEAKER_07]: That appropriation was made, and once the reimbursement from the state occurs relative to the Magoon Park issues that were being taken care of, the mayor indicated that he would be requesting the transfer of the net costs to the city's sale of real estate account.

1231
01:38:08,382 --> 01:38:11,945
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's replenishing the account, Mr. President, for which the funds were taken out of.

1232
01:38:12,525 --> 01:38:14,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Looks like the state agreed to reimburse us

1233
01:38:17,456 --> 01:38:24,300
[SPEAKER_07]: $200,000 on the Magoon Park improvements, and this paper represents, Mr. President, this matter coming full circle.

1234
01:38:24,780 --> 01:38:26,261
[SPEAKER_07]: As such, I would move for approval.

1235
01:38:26,442 --> 01:38:34,967
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe that all the councillors here, all the councillors present at the meeting voted by way of roll call in the affirmative to appropriate the money, Mr. President.

1236
01:38:35,227 --> 01:38:39,049
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think this is just bringing the matter full circle and some housekeeping.

1237
01:38:39,109 --> 01:38:41,451
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'd ask that the council move for approval.

1238
01:38:41,911 --> 01:38:44,613
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion for approval by Councilor Knight,

1239
01:38:45,167 --> 01:38:46,448
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1240
01:38:48,910 --> 01:38:49,731
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Caraviello?

1241
01:38:49,951 --> 01:38:50,191
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1242
01:38:50,532 --> 01:38:51,212
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Falco?

1243
01:38:51,372 --> 01:38:51,552
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1244
01:38:52,053 --> 01:38:52,593
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight?

1245
01:38:52,633 --> 01:38:53,054
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1246
01:38:53,394 --> 01:38:54,355
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Lungo-Koehn?

1247
01:38:54,415 --> 01:38:54,595
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1248
01:38:55,135 --> 01:38:55,756
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Marks?

1249
01:38:55,976 --> 01:38:56,236
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1250
01:38:56,817 --> 01:38:57,578
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1251
01:38:57,778 --> 01:38:57,938
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1252
01:38:58,679 --> 01:38:59,499
[SPEAKER_10]: President Dello Russo?

1253
01:38:59,559 --> 01:39:00,020
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1254
01:39:00,340 --> 01:39:05,284
[SPEAKER_10]: With a vote of seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, the matter passes.

1255
01:39:05,304 --> 01:39:05,885
[SPEAKER_10]: Anything else?

1256
01:39:08,370 --> 01:39:09,951
[SPEAKER_10]: CREDIT BRIDGE, COUNSELOR MARKS.

1257
01:39:09,971 --> 01:39:12,153
[SPEAKER_10]: DO YOU HAVE AN UPDATE ON THE CREDIT BRIDGE FOR US?

1258
01:39:12,633 --> 01:39:16,616
[SPEAKER_04]: I DON'T HAVE AN UPDATE, MR. PRESIDENT, BUT I KNOW THE LONG-AWAITED MEETING WITH D.O.T.

1259
01:39:17,177 --> 01:39:18,678
[SPEAKER_04]: WAS CANCELLED FOR TOMORROW NIGHT.

1260
01:39:19,018 --> 01:39:21,340
[SPEAKER_10]: IT WAS BECAUSE OF THEIR INABILITY TO JOIN US.

1261
01:39:21,460 --> 01:39:26,964
[SPEAKER_10]: THE CITY CLERK IS WORKING ON SOME DATES TO GET THAT GROUP TOGETHER SO THAT WE CAN ALL BE AT THE TABLE.

1262
01:39:27,644 --> 01:39:36,251
[SPEAKER_04]: MR. PRESIDENT, WE RECEIVED, I SHOULD SAY, I RECEIVED, I BELIEVE IT WAS 14 PHOTOS OF IN AND AROUND THAT PARTICULAR AREA DURING CONSTRUCTION.

1263
01:39:38,862 --> 01:39:45,207
[SPEAKER_04]: the utility work, and the number of trucks, and the barriers, and everything else going on in that area.

1264
01:39:45,747 --> 01:39:50,090
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not sure how business is going to function, but we need to call for that meeting immediately.

1265
01:39:50,911 --> 01:39:56,875
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know they only had a few days to get their parties together, but this has to happen immediately.

1266
01:39:58,236 --> 01:39:59,557
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure what your recommendation is.

1267
01:39:59,577 --> 01:40:00,297
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree with you 100%, Councilor.

1268
01:40:01,750 --> 01:40:04,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, should we put a date on this?

1269
01:40:04,272 --> 01:40:06,253
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we're waiting on if the clerk wants to.

1270
01:40:06,293 --> 01:40:14,738
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, of course there's a date of February 10th, same time, 5 30.

1271
01:40:15,359 --> 01:40:23,324
[SPEAKER_09]: That gives him now again, a week and a half or so to again, try to do it, but having a response back.

1272
01:40:25,025 --> 01:40:26,226
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate that Mr. Clerk.

1273
01:40:26,246 --> 01:40:28,467
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know how hard it is to get these parties together.

1274
01:40:28,915 --> 01:40:33,038
[SPEAKER_04]: but February 10th seems a long way away.

1275
01:40:36,601 --> 01:40:38,042
[SPEAKER_04]: But they were already on notice now.

1276
01:40:38,062 --> 01:40:40,524
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we're saying next week and that's not going to happen either.

1277
01:40:40,544 --> 01:40:44,026
[SPEAKER_04]: They're busy Monday through Friday next week.

1278
01:40:44,046 --> 01:40:47,549
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not, I'm not, I'm not sure.

1279
01:40:47,589 --> 01:40:49,651
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just saying you can make the call.

1280
01:40:49,671 --> 01:40:51,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't make the call.

1281
01:40:51,052 --> 01:40:56,776
[SPEAKER_04]: That would come from the administration of the city clerk, but it's not the, it's not the department.

1282
01:40:56,796 --> 01:40:58,097
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, they were on board to come in.

1283
01:40:59,589 --> 01:41:01,310
[SPEAKER_09]: They're already requested.

1284
01:41:01,591 --> 01:41:03,512
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a point of information.

1285
01:41:03,592 --> 01:41:04,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1286
01:41:04,572 --> 01:41:20,922
[SPEAKER_03]: We recommend that we ask them at the earliest, earliest convenience, not the 10th, but any day other than Tuesday that we can meet or, you know, we've been on a Wednesday anyways, but give us a long night to further clarification.

1287
01:41:22,105 --> 01:41:24,486
[SPEAKER_10]: Point of further clarification, Madam Vice President.

1288
01:41:25,026 --> 01:41:29,107
[SPEAKER_18]: And also, I think this should be a public meeting at 7 p.m.

1289
01:41:29,567 --> 01:41:30,668
[SPEAKER_18]: in front of the city council.

1290
01:41:30,688 --> 01:41:34,069
[SPEAKER_18]: I think the people need to see this on TV.

1291
01:41:34,109 --> 01:41:35,849
[SPEAKER_18]: I think the business owners deserve that.

1292
01:41:36,209 --> 01:41:38,510
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think that's what the business owners want.

1293
01:41:38,950 --> 01:41:41,211
[SPEAKER_18]: They're crippling business.

1294
01:41:41,711 --> 01:41:48,753
[SPEAKER_18]: And two weeks is, three weeks have gone by now where they're completely blocking business owners

1295
01:41:49,412 --> 01:41:52,234
[SPEAKER_18]: That's almost a month, and I'm a business owner.

1296
01:41:52,315 --> 01:41:57,099
[SPEAKER_18]: You have to pay bills monthly, not on a day-to-day basis or once a year.

1297
01:41:57,439 --> 01:41:58,580
[SPEAKER_18]: You pay bills monthly.

1298
01:41:58,920 --> 01:42:00,061
[SPEAKER_18]: We should have this meeting.

1299
01:42:00,141 --> 01:42:08,729
[SPEAKER_18]: We should ask them to be here next Tuesday night and cease and desist all work from being done, everything being cleared out tonight until they meet with us next Tuesday.

1300
01:42:08,969 --> 01:42:09,650
[SPEAKER_18]: That's my opinion.

1301
01:42:13,653 --> 01:42:15,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, if it's a very difficult

1302
01:42:16,623 --> 01:42:20,604
[SPEAKER_07]: endeavor for the individuals that are stationed out of Boston to get to MedFed.

1303
01:42:20,664 --> 01:42:25,126
[SPEAKER_07]: I would be happy to go to Boston and meet with them there if that's what has to take place, Mr. President.

1304
01:42:26,026 --> 01:42:26,846
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we could meet there.

1305
01:42:26,866 --> 01:42:35,469
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we could also – I think Mr. Carroll would be more than willing to open up his restaurant to us to sit down there and have the meeting there if, in fact, it's ever going to happen, Mr. President.

1306
01:42:35,489 --> 01:42:40,270
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I've had my discussions with the legislative liaison from Massachusetts Highway.

1307
01:42:40,290 --> 01:42:44,072
[SPEAKER_07]: I've gotten a number of correspondences from them because I've been added to their email list, Mr. President.

1308
01:42:46,104 --> 01:42:55,429
[SPEAKER_07]: It did seem that they were unable to make it because of the short notice from the last meeting to this meeting, but that there's no reason why they can't figure out when it is that we are going to be here and we are going to put our heads together and get this done.

1309
01:42:56,030 --> 01:43:00,432
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, some items indicated that certain phases of the construction have been complete.

1310
01:43:00,472 --> 01:43:05,095
[SPEAKER_07]: They're about close to 30% through, um, with the portion of construction, the phase that they're in right now.

1311
01:43:05,481 --> 01:43:08,343
[SPEAKER_07]: But there are a number of solutions, I think, that we can present to them.

1312
01:43:09,364 --> 01:43:13,427
[SPEAKER_07]: One of them being moving all the staging equipment onto the closed-down ramp on Route 16 right now.

1313
01:43:13,708 --> 01:43:14,388
[SPEAKER_07]: The ramp's closed.

1314
01:43:14,568 --> 01:43:21,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Put all your junk over there so we don't have to look at it, so cars can drive up and down the street, so people can park in front of the restaurant, so people can park in front of RE-MAX.

1315
01:43:21,914 --> 01:43:27,139
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I think that we've made a number of suggestions, and they have been

1316
01:43:28,167 --> 01:43:34,975
[SPEAKER_07]: listen to, and we've been given a lot of affirmative yes, yes, yes, but there haven't been any results, Mr. President.

1317
01:43:34,995 --> 01:43:36,516
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a lot of lip service at this point in time.

1318
01:43:37,057 --> 01:43:39,780
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that being said, I think it might be

1319
01:43:40,340 --> 01:43:48,023
[SPEAKER_07]: easier and more flexible if we as a council are more than willing to go and meet them on their turf or meet them somewhere else if they're not able to come down here to City Hall at certain hours.

1320
01:43:48,723 --> 01:43:51,284
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd be happy to go to the transportation building and meet with them, Mr. President.

1321
01:43:51,304 --> 01:43:53,605
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd be happy to go up to State House and- Bring your ID.

1322
01:43:53,645 --> 01:43:54,686
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to show an ID to them.

1323
01:43:54,706 --> 01:43:55,506
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a state ID.

1324
01:43:55,986 --> 01:43:59,327
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll lead at Donato's office if that's what it takes, Mr. President.

1325
01:43:59,347 --> 01:44:03,749
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think that there's more than one way to skin a cat.

1326
01:44:03,769 --> 01:44:05,790
[SPEAKER_07]: And if they're not willing to come here, maybe we have to go to them.

1327
01:44:06,600 --> 01:44:15,382
[SPEAKER_07]: The other thing we can do is maybe contact the Secretariat and see if the Secretariat can help us out in putting this together.

1328
01:44:16,042 --> 01:44:35,867
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I just wanted to put it out there that there are other ways that we can do this, and maybe one of them is to go to Boston and to have a small meeting with a group of appointees, maybe, to figure out when it is that we can come in there, what the issues and dispute are, what the agenda is going to be like, to create a format that we can all agree on, so when they do come here, we do have a productive session, Mr. President,

1329
01:44:36,460 --> 01:44:42,745
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one thing to drag the project manager and the people from the T down here to bombard them with questions, and that's all well and good.

1330
01:44:42,785 --> 01:44:44,046
[SPEAKER_07]: But then they get in their car and they leave.

1331
01:44:45,527 --> 01:44:46,588
[SPEAKER_07]: And then nothing changes.

1332
01:44:47,309 --> 01:44:48,650
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think we need to come to an accord.

1333
01:44:48,670 --> 01:44:50,772
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to work together, and we need to form a partnership with them.

1334
01:44:51,052 --> 01:44:55,615
[SPEAKER_07]: And that means that we need to be responsive to their concerns, and they need to be responsive to ours, Mr. President.

1335
01:44:55,635 --> 01:44:59,018
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll rest with that, but I appreciate you indulging me for that moment.

1336
01:44:59,479 --> 01:45:00,499
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. Councilor.

1337
01:45:01,400 --> 01:45:02,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Chair recognizes Councilor Caraviello.

1338
01:45:03,142 --> 01:45:03,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1339
01:45:05,746 --> 01:45:14,255
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe a quick short-term fixes, just have the construction company adhere to the business hours that they've set at 10 o'clock or 10.30.

1340
01:45:14,555 --> 01:45:17,218
[SPEAKER_05]: They're showing up at 8.30, 9 o'clock, parking there.

1341
01:45:17,678 --> 01:45:28,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Let the police get on there and demand that they start, or the building commissioner, or someone go down there and don't let them start work until the time they're disposed to.

1342
01:45:28,854 --> 01:45:38,277
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if you're doing work in your house on a Sunday or a Saturday before 7 o'clock, the court enforcement officer is down there telling you to stop working.

1343
01:45:39,097 --> 01:45:45,038
[SPEAKER_05]: But they weren't supposed to start working in certain areas there until after 10 o'clock, and they're starting at 9 now.

1344
01:45:45,899 --> 01:45:52,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, that's not a big request from the gentleman to just start working when you're supposed to start.

1345
01:45:53,101 --> 01:45:57,742
[SPEAKER_05]: And I say, I don't know why the police can't enforce that on our own without even going crazy.

1346
01:46:00,795 --> 01:46:01,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1347
01:46:03,157 --> 01:46:03,917
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Falco.

1348
01:46:03,957 --> 01:46:05,278
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1349
01:46:06,899 --> 01:46:09,101
[SPEAKER_16]: I find this to be very frustrating.

1350
01:46:09,141 --> 01:46:14,564
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I know I made the resolution last week to have the Committee of the Whole meeting, and here they are.

1351
01:46:15,225 --> 01:46:19,307
[SPEAKER_16]: They've canceled, but we're giving them a whole week, and they still can't give us a date.

1352
01:46:19,648 --> 01:46:20,748
[SPEAKER_16]: So this is very frustrating.

1353
01:46:20,768 --> 01:46:25,492
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, to me, you're impacting the livelihoods of people that own these businesses.

1354
01:46:25,892 --> 01:46:30,395
[SPEAKER_16]: You're impacting the residents and how they get to and from South Medford and beyond.

1355
01:46:31,060 --> 01:46:34,402
[SPEAKER_16]: And the meeting really needs to happen sooner than later.

1356
01:46:34,482 --> 01:46:41,666
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, is there any way that we can have our state reps, our mayor, make a call to DOT and explain the urgency of this matter?

1357
01:46:41,686 --> 01:46:43,908
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, this has to happen sooner than later.

1358
01:46:44,388 --> 01:46:46,789
[SPEAKER_16]: It should not have to wait another week, week and a half, two weeks.

1359
01:46:46,849 --> 01:46:48,630
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, this, it needs to happen.

1360
01:46:48,650 --> 01:46:49,371
[SPEAKER_16]: This is important.

1361
01:46:50,191 --> 01:46:57,696
[SPEAKER_16]: And if I may, I know myself and Mr. Scarpelli are new to this committee, would it be possible to get

1362
01:46:59,284 --> 01:47:01,125
[SPEAKER_16]: the original agreement between D.O.T.

1363
01:47:01,145 --> 01:47:09,992
[SPEAKER_16]: and the city with regard to the bridge and when work was... I'm not aware of us having received a copy of it, but... Well, then can the whole committee, I guess, receive a copy?

1364
01:47:10,012 --> 01:47:18,519
[SPEAKER_16]: Because it would be nice to actually see something in writing as to what the rules of engagement with regard to the work that's being done.

1365
01:47:18,879 --> 01:47:26,385
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, it seems like it's kind of everyone's a little bit all over the place with regard to when it's supposed to start, when it's supposed to stop, you know, exactly what's happening down there.

1366
01:47:26,425 --> 01:47:28,026
[SPEAKER_16]: So if we could get some sort of communication

1367
01:47:29,200 --> 01:47:39,424
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not sure if it's the engineering department or what, but if you could get something with the agreement between the DOT and the city with regard to how everything is supposed to work with regard to the replacement of the Craddock Bridge.

1368
01:47:39,905 --> 01:47:58,633
[SPEAKER_10]: So that is a motion by Councilor Falco offered under suspension of the rules that the city engineer or appropriate office furnish the seven members of the Medford City Council with the copy of the agreement, uh,

1369
01:47:59,392 --> 01:48:04,156
[SPEAKER_10]: signed regarding the construction of the Craddock Bridge.

1370
01:48:05,076 --> 01:48:05,397
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1371
01:48:05,717 --> 01:48:06,778
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, council.

1372
01:48:07,378 --> 01:48:08,679
[SPEAKER_10]: I share your frustration.

1373
01:48:09,199 --> 01:48:17,786
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been in conversation with a member of our state delegation as well as the mayor regarding this and they share frustration as well.

1374
01:48:19,307 --> 01:48:28,574
[SPEAKER_10]: And I spoke at length with the mayor about this and she's particularly discouraged at the canceling of the meeting for tomorrow night.

1375
01:48:30,594 --> 01:48:32,716
[SPEAKER_07]: Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

1376
01:48:32,976 --> 01:48:43,545
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the things that we discussed several weeks ago, Mr. President, was a central depository or a central receptacle for individuals who weren't able to make the meeting, but would still like to comment on it to be able to provide an email.

1377
01:48:44,726 --> 01:48:53,374
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's my understanding that through the works of Allison Goldberry and Mr. Rumley, this email was a setup and I believe Clerk Finn has been involved in this as well.

1378
01:48:53,858 --> 01:49:02,483
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it might be very helpful to those at home who are eagerly and anxiously awaiting the meeting to utilize this tool.

1379
01:49:03,023 --> 01:49:08,306
[SPEAKER_07]: And with that being said, I was hoping that the city clerk could recite the email address for us if he knows it offhand.

1380
01:49:08,366 --> 01:49:08,807
[SPEAKER_07]: I could get it.

1381
01:49:08,827 --> 01:49:11,508
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I have it on my device here if you don't know it offhand.

1382
01:49:11,528 --> 01:49:13,109
[SPEAKER_07]: It can be linked through the city website.

1383
01:49:13,129 --> 01:49:14,530
[SPEAKER_07]: And it can also be linked to the city website.

1384
01:49:14,650 --> 01:49:15,150
[SPEAKER_07]: Medford.org.

1385
01:49:15,290 --> 01:49:15,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1386
01:49:16,271 --> 01:49:19,513
[SPEAKER_07]: So the city is actually soliciting commentary right now on behalf of the council.

1387
01:49:19,553 --> 01:49:20,954
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there was one comment already.

1388
01:49:21,034 --> 01:49:21,634
[SPEAKER_10]: One or two.

1389
01:49:21,654 --> 01:49:21,854
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1390
01:49:24,467 --> 01:49:26,328
[SPEAKER_10]: Chair recognizes the citizen at the podium.

1391
01:49:26,368 --> 01:49:26,709
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome.

1392
01:49:27,169 --> 01:49:28,570
[SPEAKER_10]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1393
01:49:29,250 --> 01:49:31,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, sir, and Councilors.

1394
01:49:32,792 --> 01:49:34,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Rachel Tannenhaus, 26 Pearl Street.

1395
01:49:36,194 --> 01:49:41,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the first thing is that in my other life, I am, in fact, a government bureaucrat.

1396
01:49:41,798 --> 01:49:48,402
[SPEAKER_02]: And the one good thing I can say about bureaucracy, and you don't need me to tell you this, is that everybody has a boss.

1397
01:49:49,342 --> 01:49:59,428
[SPEAKER_02]: And eventually you get high enough up on the boss chain that the boss is like, why am I having to deal with your stuff from all the way down there?

1398
01:50:00,148 --> 01:50:06,231
[SPEAKER_02]: So the people at MassDOT who are cancelling have bosses and it

1399
01:50:07,672 --> 01:50:17,374
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, at this point, you probably already know that there's nothing wrong with, you know, going over their head and saying, hey, your employee is not actually doing their job.

1400
01:50:18,415 --> 01:50:32,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, obviously, you know, if there are neighborhood organizations that were to, you know, say something to the press about how a city is being ignored by the state agency,

1401
01:50:34,419 --> 01:50:35,719
[SPEAKER_02]: And they went with it.

1402
01:50:35,879 --> 01:50:37,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, nobody on the council would do such a thing.

1403
01:50:37,800 --> 01:50:46,542
[SPEAKER_02]: But that is something that might also speed things up a little bit on their end is bad publicity.

1404
01:50:47,142 --> 01:50:57,544
[SPEAKER_02]: But the thing that I would like to say in my other capacity as the chair of the Medford Disability Commission, which none of that was in, so this is my disability chair hat.

1405
01:50:57,884 --> 01:50:58,484
[SPEAKER_02]: It's invisible.

1406
01:50:58,544 --> 01:51:01,045
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very fetching, is that

1407
01:51:03,497 --> 01:51:19,940
[SPEAKER_02]: The only good thing I can say about the meeting for tomorrow night being cancelled is that those of us in the Disability Commission were very disappointed that it had been scheduled for exactly when the Disability Commission meeting was supposed to be and is going to be tomorrow night because we really wanted to be involved.

1408
01:51:19,980 --> 01:51:32,002
[SPEAKER_02]: We obviously have some significant concerns about what's going on with the Craddock Bridge and we wouldn't have been able to be there because it was at exactly the same time and happened quickly enough that we weren't able to modify our agenda.

1409
01:51:32,598 --> 01:51:33,799
[SPEAKER_02]: for it or anything like that.

1410
01:51:33,959 --> 01:51:52,198
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd like to, I hope, even if it were the next day after that, that's fine, but I hope that when it is rescheduled that we are, I hope that it's as soon as possible, but I hope that we're also able to be there, members of the Disability Commission, because, so if it could not be during

1411
01:51:52,612 --> 01:51:55,694
[SPEAKER_02]: the Disability Commission meeting, that would be really fantastic.

1412
01:51:55,794 --> 01:52:07,183
[SPEAKER_02]: I doubt it will be because the next one after tomorrow is in a month, and I think at that point everybody's head will have exploded if they have to wait that long, but we would really like to be involved.

1413
01:52:07,523 --> 01:52:15,489
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we obviously would love it if it could happen at a time that was not when we were otherwise meeting.

1414
01:52:15,790 --> 01:52:16,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.

1415
01:52:16,510 --> 01:52:17,451
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Rachel.

1416
01:52:17,531 --> 01:52:18,672
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion for approval by

1417
01:52:19,147 --> 01:52:21,948
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Falco on his motion.

1418
01:52:22,448 --> 01:52:23,389
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

1419
01:52:24,869 --> 01:52:25,370
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

1420
01:52:26,230 --> 01:52:27,190
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion carries.

1421
01:52:28,651 --> 01:52:33,613
[SPEAKER_10]: Records of meeting of January 19th, 2016.

1422
01:52:34,093 --> 01:52:35,574
[SPEAKER_10]: We're past it, Councilor Knight.

1423
01:52:35,614 --> 01:52:37,154
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Councilor, how'd you find those records?

1424
01:52:39,175 --> 01:52:40,236
[SPEAKER_10]: In order and move for approval.

1425
01:52:40,316 --> 01:52:42,337
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion for approval, the records of that meeting.

1426
01:52:42,397 --> 01:52:43,117
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

1427
01:52:47,059 --> 01:52:47,919
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

1428
01:52:49,076 --> 01:52:56,934
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion records have passed and accepted on the motion for adjournment by councillor Falco all those in favor all those opposed.

1429
01:52:56,954 --> 01:52:57,776
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you all
