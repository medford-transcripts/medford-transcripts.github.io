    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=27.439s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=28.28s">Senate</a>  members present and absent, please rise to salute the flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=32.982s">I</a>  pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=46.537s">16-040</a>  offered by Vice President Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=51.439s">Be</a>  it resolved that the Chief of Police update the Medford City Council on how many citations slash tickets have been given in 2015 and 2016 with regards to vehicles illegally parking on sidewalks in the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=68.746s">Madam</a>  Vice President.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=73.78s">Thank</a>  you, President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=75.942s">I</a>  bring this up with regards to vehicles illegally parking on sidewalks in Medford because of a few complaints in a few different areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=87.512s">I</a>  know we as a council have spoken about this and we had pictures and we had maybe four or five people in the audience two months ago with regards to the problem that's happening on Main and Harvard. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=100.72s">But</a>  I also have received complaints with regards to Winthrop Street and in one other street since that meeting aired. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=110.386s">We</a>  have a problem in the South Medford area. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=113.268s">The</a>  chief of police at the last traffic commission meeting, which was held back the first week in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=122.774s">No,</a>  maybe January 5th, I believe, stated to the audience and stated to us that we're in the audience <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=130.18s">enforcement</a>  was going to be picked up and that they were going to start, I believe, I'm not going to put words in anybody's mouth, but I came to think that more tickets were going to be issued. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=138.805s">So</a>  not only are people parking there, large Mack trucks are pulling onto the sidewalk, completely blocking sidewalks, not allowing, I mean, you cannot go to a wheelchair or a stroller or even, you know, an adult and a child who need to walk side by side. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=157.536s">You</a>  can't traverse the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=159.928s">I'm</a>  getting complaints from five, six, seven, eight different people down in that area, and I know we all are, day after day. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=167.59s">I</a>  mean, I think I've gotten four emails from two different people today alone with pitches attached to the violators, and I just don't think it's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=177.913s">And</a>  so I'd like to see how many tickets were issued with regards to <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=184.619s">vehicles</a>  parking on any sidewalk, not just that area, because I want to see, you know, I know I've seen it all over the city, and I want to see what enforcement has been done within 2015, and now come 2016, how many tickets have been issued. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=199.492s">Maybe</a>  we could break it down to North Medford, South Medford, West Medford, so we can get an idea and a better picture on where the problems lie, and if we're enforcing at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=213.622s">I'd</a>  also like to amend this to just request from the mayor's office, you know, what stance the mayor's office has with regards to enforcement on sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=224.071s">I</a>  think it had, you know, the chief of police is very nice and he was willing to listen, you know, him and the traffic commission were definitely willing to listen the beginning of January to the problems and the issues and the concerns, but I don't think enough is being done and I don't think <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=240.327s">I</a>  really would hope that the administration from the top down would let people know that that's not acceptable, it's not right, and we need to figure out as a city how we can get these deliveries to our businesses that isn't going to impede on people's ability to traverse our sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=257.172s">So</a>  I know that area sticks out at me specifically because I see pictures every day with regards to trucks and vehicles parking on those roads, blocking driveways, blocking the sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=271.313s">not</a>  only should they not be blocking sidewalks, but if a Mack truck is pulling up on a sidewalk where people, that's a busy area, that's a bus stop right near there, and people are walking and traversing those sidewalks all the time, I'd hate for a pedestrian to get hit while on a sidewalk by a Mack truck that accidentally didn't see somebody. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=293.71s">You'd</a>  hate to see somebody heading to school, a young child heading to school, <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=300.537s">have</a>  to come into the street because they can't use a sidewalk and get struck. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=304.619s">You</a>  see it in other cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=305.9s">You</a>  see it on the news. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=307.341s">I</a>  don't want it to happen to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=308.762s">I</a>  don't want it to happen considering those emails are sent to every department head, almost every department head in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=316.146s">They're</a>  sent to the chief of police. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=317.726s">They're</a>  now being sent to our new mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=319.727s">It</a>  needs to stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=320.768s">We</a>  need to figure this out and we need to enforce it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=324.85s">I</a>  was adamant about enforcing it a month, two months ago when it came before the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=330.528s">I,</a>  as one of probably three city councilors, I know Councilor Caraviello was at the traffic commission meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=336.234s">We</a>  made the effort to go on a two o'clock, I think it was on a Tuesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=341.799s">Us</a>  and residents took the time off of work to be there because it's an important issue and I don't feel like it was given the weight it should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=349.366s">I</a>  feel like almost we were appeased, we'll enforce, we'll enforce more. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=353.971s">I</a>  just feel like that's not enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=356.227s">So</a>  I really ask, number one, how many tickets have been issued? <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=360.268s">Because</a>  if not many tickets have been issued in 2016, especially since when we told there were going to be, then we have a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=368.171s">And</a>  I also want to amend it to see if the mayor of our city will step up, ask the chief of police to step up enforcement with regards to this particular issue.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=377.714s">On</a>  the motion of Vice President Lungo-Koehn, as amended, Councilor Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=382.595s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=384.016s">At</a>  that same meeting, <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=385.432s">It</a>  was suggested that the republic parking do that also. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=390.617s">Seeing</a>  that they're going around doing the other ticketing, why can't they ticket those cars too? <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=394.6s">And</a>  it was suggested that maybe I have another motion in regards to Park Method later this evening, but maybe it's time for Park Methodists to <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=403.296s">to</a>  come in with us and step up there and see where they're going in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=406.838s">And</a>  I'll talk about that later in the evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=409.339s">But</a>  again, that was a suggestion for that D.N. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=411.9s">Nash,</a>  go out and hire a couple more people, because you can't do a whole city with four people.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=419.024s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor.</p>

    <p>[jCO6jvvXtn0_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=420.945s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=421.525s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=423.486s">I'm</a>  Nick Tomazook, 29 Garfield Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=425.507s">Welcome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=426.067s">How</a>  you doing, guys? <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=427.968s">I'm</a>  just parking business. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=431.76s">I</a>  walk my dogs every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=433.181s">I</a>  have two dogs. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=435.322s">And</a>  how many times I have to go out in the street because people park their cars in their driveway and block the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=446.147s">And</a>  no ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=448.768s">You</a>  see unattached trailers just sitting on the roadways, no tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=456.791s">And</a>  those are commercial trailers. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=461.295s">commercial</a>  cars parked in the streets, no tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=465.798s">I</a>  called the station and they told me that they're too busy to ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=471.662s">And</a>  I don't know if you guys remember when I first spoke about parking, we were talking about getting retired people in the city to issue parking tickets instead of this monstrosity that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=486.811s">And</a>  this is all revenue that the city's losing. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=490.587s">But</a>  we need to get after this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=492.868s">And</a>  to, not to get off the subject of the parking, but I'm talking, when you try to cross in a crosswalk and these cars, when they pull up to the red light, it seems like they forgot what a stop line is. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=505.513s">It</a>  seems like they have to get their car right into the crosswalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=508.414s">So</a>  you have to walk around them. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=511.175s">You</a>  know, nobody's getting ticketed in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=514.637s">We</a>  need to get somebody, you know, to get after, <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=517.995s">You</a>  know, whoever we have to, if we have to get another parking enforcement crew from the city and forget those other idiots and do our own thing and raise revenue for the city so we don't have to raise taxes or anything else, I'll volunteer to tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=538.748s">I'll</a>  bet you I'll write you a thousand tickets a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=543.491s">And</a>  a thousand tickets, even if it was five bucks each, do the math. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=548.984s">We</a>  have to do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=550.085s">I</a>  mean, it's just getting rampant. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=551.206s">You</a>  know, they park on the sidewalk, they block the crosswalks, they block the sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=556.749s">They</a>  don't care, because they know they're not going to get ticketed. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=561.913s">And</a>  this 48-hour business, I mean, we had a snowstorm last Saturday, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=566.977s">Drive</a>  down any given street in Medford, and I'll bet you find two or three cars that haven't moved yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=574.982s">They</a>  were waiting for the sun to melt the snow off their cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=580.177s">All</a>  right, that's all I have to say, folks.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=582.038s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=582.659s">Thank</a>  you, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=584.32s">Chair</a>  recognizes Vice President Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=586.982s">On</a>  that point, and thank you, President Dello Russo, I think if we left the people alone who are maybe paid for parking and are there for an extra five, ten minutes and instead worry about the actual serious violations within the city of Medford, we would have far less tickets to just the average person who maybe <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=608.08s">in</a>  the hairdresser an extra five or 10 minutes, and we'd have resolved to problems such as this with regards to people parking on the sidewalks, in handicapped spots that they don't have a handicap placard. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=621.784s">I</a>  mean, there are so many other violations and things that could keep Republic Parking very busy, and enforcement, enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=630.267s">But</a>  the problem with that is it needs to come <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=634.887s">Our</a>  department, our police department needs to get direction from the chief of police to be able to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=640.613s">Or</a>  needs to, public parking needs to get direction from the chief of police. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=644.797s">And</a>  I strongly believe that our new mayor needs to put pressure on the chief of police to do this enforcement that's so desperately needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=653.765s">It</a>  needs to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=654.706s">It's</a>  something that the old administration back in 2015 and prior to <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=659.478s">did</a>  not put enough effort into at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=662.942s">We're</a>  known as the no enforcement city. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=666.387s">I</a>  don't know of any other city that doesn't enforce the way we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=669.791s">I</a>  don't know of a ticket that has happened <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=674.821s">I</a>  obviously never get complaints about tickets because we don't ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=679.044s">We</a>  don't enforce. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=680.185s">If</a>  you go to Somerville, if you go to Malden, even if you go to Winchester and park for over an hour in a spot that's an hour parking, you're getting a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=691.113s">Republic</a>  is the only sense of enforcement that we have, and they're just getting the people that could be doing other things and ticketing for other good reasons and clearing up some of these problems that are persistent. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=702.802s">And</a>  I know I sound frustrated, but I <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=705.371s">I</a>  went over the history on this, and it goes far back. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=708.394s">It</a>  goes back years at this point, and it's very frustrating, and it's very frustrating for all the people that can't traverse sidewalks and that live in these neighborhoods where it is a serious problem.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=720.044s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=722.266s">The</a>  Chair now recognizes Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=724.869s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=726.23s">I</a>  can certainly <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=727.744s">understand</a>  the frustration of the residents down on the Main Street area, I can certainly understand the frustrations of Councilor Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=734.11s">However,</a>  I think it's very important to point out that if we want enforcement, we want enforcement across the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=738.995s">I</a>  don't think we want our parking enforcement officers to pick and choose what they want to enforce and what they don't want to enforce. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=744.46s">And,</a>  you know, although I understand where she's coming from, why are they ticketing someone who's 10 minutes over the meter and not ticketing the car that's on the sidewalk? <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=750.686s">I</a>  think they both need to get a ticket because the ordinance is clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=753.165s">We've</a>  entered into a contract with Republic Parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=755.647s">Republic</a>  Parking has the responsibility to enforce the ordinances that are in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=759.21s">They're</a>  not doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=760.451s">They're</a>  not doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=761.071s">We</a>  have some ordinances that are in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=762.532s">They're</a>  not being enforced, and they need to be enforced, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=764.634s">It's</a>  really an enforcement issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=765.675s">It's</a>  not a legislative issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=767.796s">And</a>  I scratch my head every night thinking about ways of how we can prompt action, but it's really a function of the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=774.521s">So</a>  I certainly do agree with Councilor Lungo that we need some directed enforcement down in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=779.511s">We've</a>  all seen the pictures. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=780.332s">We've</a>  all heard the stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=781.192s">We've</a>  all voted in favor of directed enforcements down there, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=783.894s">So</a>  I can understand why the level of frustration is growing high. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=788.436s">However,</a>  I guess the question that I pose is whether or not they did 100 tickets or seven tickets, what's the end game? <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=795.02s">What's</a>  the solution at the end of the day? <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=796.421s">What</a>  are we going to do to ensure that this enforcement gets done? <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=798.883s">And</a>  that's the question that I pose to the body. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=801.744s">You</a>  know, we need to provide a solution, some sort of solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=804.246s">What</a>  is that solution? <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=805.306s">I</a>  don't know, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=806.287s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=806.707s">I</a>  don't have all the answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=808.161s">I</a>  think that this body, based upon the seven people that are behind this reel, could certainly come up with several solutions and several recommendations, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=814.383s">And</a>  I'd request that our subcommittee on transportation meet to do that.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=818.424s">Thank</a>  you, Consular. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=819.745s">The</a>  chair now recognizes the citizen at the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=822.926s">Good</a>  evening, welcome, and please state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[acqgxK4yhEM_SPEAKER_28]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=826.203s">Good</a>  evening, Jace Balding, Mystic Valley Parkway. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=829.325s">I</a>  wanted to thank Councilor Lingo-Cohen for bringing this issue up. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=834.869s">It</a>  is something that is near and dear to the folks who have mobility impairments like myself and is throughout the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=845.016s">One</a>  of the issues with cars parking on the sidewalk is that if you have feet or the ability to use them, <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=854.823s">You</a>  can hop off a sidewalk and go around the car. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=858.205s">If</a>  you are in a wheeled mobility device, whether that is a power chair like mine or a scooter of some sort, you then have to go backwards, sometimes several city blocks before you can find an accessible way to continue forward in your trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=876.177s">And</a>  the other issue is with people who use canes, like the one I'm holding in my hand, the long white cane. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=883.803s">I</a>  have caused, I have had personal injury because I've run into a vehicle in the past when I was ambulatory and when I am ambulatory these days, walking at the general human speed, when your cane <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=902.704s">goes</a>  back and forth in front of a car, and it gets stuck right under the body of a car, and the handle jabs you right into the gut and leaves a series of bruises in your gut, that is just something that eventually can cause not only <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=921.47s">internal</a>  damage, but some serious frustration at drivers. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=925.414s">So</a>  I think that this is both an issue for the citizens of Medford who drive and have vehicles to consider, is that as good citizens we're causing each other pain, and that's unnecessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=937.405s">And</a>  also, aside from what tickets are being issued, <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=941.248s">Again,</a>  what can this body do to support the overall health and safety of all citizens, including those ones who travel the sidewalks and need as much accessibility as possible?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=956.357s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=956.938s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=962.441s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=963.001s">Welcome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=963.402s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=966.266s">Hi,</a>  I'm Cheryl Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=967.487s">I</a>  live at 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=970.109s">On</a>  my street is Hickey Park on one end and the Roberts School on the other end, which has approximately 600 children, most of which come from the Fellsway area to go to the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=981.459s">Next</a>  to Hickey Park, there is a parking platform that was built by the DPW approximately 10 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=988.426s">The</a>  curbstone was built at a slant in order to make it easier for the cars to drive onto the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=994.723s">Every</a>  day, a DPW worker who lives across the street comes home, parks his car on the sidewalk, and has lunch at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1001.927s">Every</a>  year, there are space savers on that parking lot, and if you walk too close with your dog or anything, they tell you to get away from their car and get off their parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1011.071s">I</a>  was yelled at this week for going too close as they were shoveling the snow into the path that I had asked Mayor McGlynn to build. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1020.033s">because</a>  there was no sidewalk on that side of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1022.495s">And</a>  on the opposite side of the street, we have a handicapped person who parks blocking the other sidewalk, which was the only reason I was able to get the path built because I was initially told to walk on the other side of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1034.546s">It</a>  took five years to have that path built. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1036.708s">There</a>  are still cars parked on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1038.649s">They</a>  had to put a fence between the path and the parking platform because they were parking on the new path. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1044.646s">So</a>  this is a serious issue and the city workers are doing it too. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1048.909s">If</a>  you go buy Eddie's pizza, the police cars are on the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1052.651s">If</a>  you go buy nappies, there's a police car parked on the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1058.295s">And</a>  Republic doesn't go to my neighborhood because we don't have meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1063.057s">So</a>  Republic will not enforce this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1065.559s">The</a>  police will not enforce this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1067.6s">Somebody</a>  told me they got a ticket for parking on the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1070.736s">but</a>  they were able to get it turned around because it's a recognized parking platform. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1074.697s">So</a>  that's something that you need to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1077.218s">A</a>  beautiful sidewalk was built and is now a parking lot for city residents.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1083.02s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1083.921s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1085.241s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1086.041s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Sqp6S0Yyr0A_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1090.243s">Hello,</a>  Rachel Tannenhaus, 26 Pearl Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1095.719s">I</a>  also have a block full of people who park on my street. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1099.68s">It's</a>  not a very long street, so you only get a block of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1102.301s">I'm</a>  sure if it were longer, there'd be more. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1105.342s">Many</a>  of them live there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1107.122s">They</a>  often park right in front of my gate. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1110.463s">Let</a>  me tell you how pretty it isn't when a blind person walks out their gate, and there's a car right there, and there's no room to, you know, I mean, this dog can only do so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1120.046s">He</a>  can't transcend space and time. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1124.161s">If</a>  there is a car right there in front of my gate, it means I can't get out without injuring myself and injuring the car, which I have to tell you I feel slightly less bad about. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1136.346s">During</a>  the 13 months between guide dogs, that I had between guide dogs when I was using a cane, <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1142.907s">It</a>  was a very long 13 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1146.029s">I</a>  also had that issue where I would walk out and as Jay said, the cane would get caught under the car and of course I'd be right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1154.935s">And</a>  I have, I got to tell you when there was a car parked on the sidewalk, if I am using the cane for one reason or another, like when I take him to the groomers, he goes a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1162.24s">So</a>  that actually happens more often than you'd think. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1165.702s">I</a>  have no problem smacking the car with my cane because <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1169.295s">It's</a>  an obstacle, and that's what the cane is for. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1172.637s">And</a>  I have to tell you that all up and down my street, and on trash day, forget it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1178.601s">There's</a>  no way to get up and down the street because the trash barrels are out there, and people have parked on the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1184.205s">In</a>  fact, sometimes there are people parking on the sidewalk such you can't find a place to put your trash barrel, which is less of an issue, but still annoying. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1193.67s">But</a>  I have to say, it impacts my ability to travel safely. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1197.593s">I</a>  also often have to go out in the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1201.276s">This</a>  is particularly the case in the winter when you have limited amounts of sidewalk you can use anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1206.279s">People</a>  do shovel, but I mean, ice happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1210.662s">And</a>  OK, people sometimes shovel. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1214.205s">So</a>  I do want to say that it's not, like Cheryl said, it's not just where the meters are. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1221.783s">It's</a>  absolutely in the residential areas that don't necessarily have meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1225.426s">People</a>  are just parking there because that's where they figure their parking space is. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1230.331s">And</a>  it happens all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1232.413s">And</a>  I have to say, like, if they don't feel like really enforcing it, but it is against the law, I certainly think it'd be interesting to see how many tickets have been issued on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1243.323s">But</a>  the report I would really like to see from the police, if you could request that, <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1247.468s">would</a>  be the list of things that are illegal that they don't really feel like enforcing right now, because that would be a really interesting list, and I bet a lot of people would benefit greatly from it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1258.812s">So,</a>  thanks very much.</p>

    <p>[Joe Viglione]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1266.395s">Joe</a>  Villione, 59 Garfield Avenue, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1269.296s">I</a>  second what Rachel said. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1270.816s">She's</a>  right on the money there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1272.597s">What's</a>  the list of the items <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1276.932s">that</a>  people violate that we don't even know about. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1279.733s">Now,</a>  June 13, 2015, if you go to my blog, MedfordInformationCentral.com, you will see a Republic parking guy right on the sidewalk, impeding public safety, while there's a woman's car in the bus stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1295.077s">And</a>  then the transit police were there from the MBTA. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1299.218s">I</a>  don't know why, but they were there, and the woman was illegally parked, and there's Republic parking on the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1305.02s">And</a>  I'm sitting there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1306.182s">in</a>  my window doing my work, and I look out and it's like, wow. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1310.124s">The</a>  crosswalk on Salem Street, right off from Garfield, always a car on the crosswalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1316.888s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1317.609s">Now,</a>  when I go over to the grocery store there and there's a car there, it's very dangerous because, as Council President even agreed with me, it's a speedway. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1328.558s">It's</a>  a speedway to Malden and Revere because they get off the highway and it's easier than going down 16, which is like a dozen to two dozen lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1338.688s">So</a>  they all love to go down Salem Street and shoot to Revere. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1344.027s">by</a>  going through Malden, and they speed. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1345.748s">They</a>  speed. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1346.368s">It's</a>  20 miles an hour, and it's unbelievable. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1348.969s">The</a>  cars that zip by me while I'm in the crosswalk, while I'm in, and they have attitude. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1356.591s">They</a>  think, we don't have to follow the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1359.192s">We</a>  want to get where we're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1360.432s">And</a>  they, it's not only me. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1363.253s">I've</a>  said this before at the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1364.513s">There</a>  was a guy laying flat out on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1366.254s">God</a>  knows what happened to him. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1368.615s">There've</a>  been car accidents out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1370.895s">All</a>  the time I've lived here, and I watch from that window, <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1373.457s">You</a>  cannot believe the craziness. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1375.258s">So</a>  why aren't we enforcing this stuff? <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1378.28s">Now,</a>  yesterday was the first time in my life I paid for parking in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1382.242s">I</a>  paid 25 cents at Citizens Bank in Haines Square because we had to go to the hardware store, and the Malden hardware store. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1388.366s">I</a>  avoid the city, and I love the stores here. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1391.208s">I</a>  walked to Mystic Coffee Roasters this morning because my car was in the shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1395.29s">So</a>  I will walk, but I will not pay the bounty hunters. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1399.535s">This</a>  is just a little information for this city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1401.876s">Now</a>  you have the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1402.697s">It's</a>  in your lap. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1403.697s">Good</a>  luck.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1404.077s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1408.86s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1410.441s">Welcome,</a>  Jean.</p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1411.321s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1411.782s">Jean</a>  Martin, 10 Cummings Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1413.182s">And</a>  I'd just like to say that the issue of sidewalks is going to get worse because we have had so much development and we have more cars on the street than ever before. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1421.347s">And</a>  we have more people on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1423.648s">But</a>  as far as enforcement goes, <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1428.064s">The</a>  person that's in charge of the ticketing and oversight is Diane McLeod, whose job is the multicultural person, and her job is to be nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1437.736s">I</a>  don't know why she has the job of being the judge of the tickets, because basically her job is to mediate between <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1444.172s">constituency</a>  groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1445.833s">So</a>  I don't understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1446.713s">It</a>  should be under the law enforcement agency of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1449.894s">It</a>  should be under the chief of police. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1452.795s">It</a>  should be under his direction and he should be cracking down on enforcement issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1458.036s">But</a>  the reason why he doesn't is because it causes a lot of inner fighting and a lot of grief and people will come up because they're not used to being told what to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1467.219s">They're</a>  not used to being told that they can't park in a certain spot and it causes a lot of grief. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1472.128s">and</a>  a lot of aggravation. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1473.289s">And</a>  that's why it's not being enforced. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1475.19s">So</a>  I just want to say that it's going to have to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1478.412s">Otherwise,</a>  you're going to have people in the streets getting hurt. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1481.774s">You</a>  really are. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1482.314s">You're</a>  going to have people in the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1484.275s">And</a>  wait until the competition. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1485.676s">And</a>  I'm glad that those ladies spoke from the disability community, because it's called a sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1492.36s">Walk.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1493.02s">A</a>  sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1494.341s">So</a>  unfortunately, they can't walk, so they need to wheel. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1497.423s">But</a>  it's designed for strollers and people and <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1501.578s">First</a>  of all, wheelchairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1503.419s">And</a>  if a wheelchair can't get through a spot, then you need to take the tree out or whatever it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1508.081s">Trees</a>  come second to people walking on the sidewalks, because it's called a sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1512.763s">I</a>  like trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1513.763s">I'm</a>  all for trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1514.563s">If</a>  you can put a tree and fit a tree, and you can fit a wheelchair, all the more power to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1519.085s">But</a>  if you can't, then the tree comes second to the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1521.946s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1522.747s">Thank</a>  you, Chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1525.888s">The</a>  Chair now recognizes Councilor Falco.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1528.649s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1531.686s">a</a>  really bad public safety issue that needs to be addressed sooner than later. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1536.308s">As</a>  I walk through the city, I walk to the bus every day, and I do see this, and it's alarming. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1542.451s">I</a>  mean, you know, I think when you go for your permit and you learn to drive and whatnot, you always learn you shouldn't have your car on the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1549.413s">And,</a>  you know, in some neighborhoods, and we've all received pictures, you're seeing four, all four wheels on the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1554.335s">It</a>  makes no sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1555.736s">These,</a>  you know, the police department needs to, you know, enforce these laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1561.044s">and</a>  give out tickets for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1562.725s">And</a>  if I may comment on one of the points that one of the residents brought up earlier is down on Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1570.627s">When</a>  I walked down to the fellows way, I see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1573.468s">There</a>  is a section of the sidewalk next to Yankee Park that has a slanted curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1578.789s">And</a>  it's definitely something I think that needs to be addressed or looked into. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1583.051s">If</a>  we could, if I could amend the resolution to have the police chief report back to us <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1588.242s">of</a>  whether or not this is a legal parking platform, because everyone has full, all four wheels of the car, of each car, they're all on the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1598.928s">So</a>  I'd like to know, I mean, is this a legal parking platform or is it not, and why isn't it being enforced? <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1604.911s">I</a>  mean, people are being forced out into the street, it's near a school, there are kids walking to school, a lot of kids take the bus, but there are kids in that neighborhood that do walk to school, and this is a public safety issue that needs to be addressed, <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1618.11s">needs</a>  to be addressed sooner than later. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1619.851s">We're</a>  in the middle of the winter, it's starting to snow. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1622.313s">And</a>  so if I could amend the resolution to reflect that inquiry regarding the parking platform, greatly appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1630.799s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1631.219s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1631.699s">So</a>  on the motion by Vice President Lungo-Koehn as amended by the same and by Councilor Falco, the chair now recognizes Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1642.567s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1643.408s">I</a>  want to thank Councilor Lungo-Koehn for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1646.378s">This</a>  issue raises its ugly head every year, and it's been like this for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1652.441s">And</a>  some of the residents, I think, brought up a valid point. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1655.883s">When</a>  we brought on Republic Parking, their responsibility was for the meated areas in the business districts and also for any area that has resident permit parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1667.028s">So</a>  there are hundreds of other streets in the city throughout all the different neighborhoods that <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1672.704s">Republic</a>  parking is not going into those areas to do enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1676.607s">And</a>  they're not under contract to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1679.248s">It's</a>  up to the police department to get out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1681.77s">And</a>  for years, I've spoken about traffic calming approaches and ways to take back our city streets from people speeding and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1690.456s">And</a>  now it seems like we have to discuss taking back our sidewalks because you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1696.159s">It's</a>  becoming an epidemic in this city with people parking on sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1700.244s">people</a>  not respecting handicap ramps, crosswalks, parking in front of crosswalks, parking too close to an intersection so a fire truck or an ambulance can't make it down your street, parking too close to an apron of a driveway. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1715.631s">The</a>  city ordinance is that I believe it's two feet from a driveway that on either side that you can't park. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1722.454s">And</a>  that's never enforced in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1725.316s">So</a>  I think it's long overdue, Mr. President, that the Traffic Division <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1730.285s">coupled</a>  with the chief of police, sit down and have, I've asked for a public safety summit year after year after year under the old administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1739.03s">And</a>  apparently when pedestrians are struck and killed on our roads, which has happened when this is not something that we're saying, God forbid something happens in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1747.955s">We</a>  had a woman struck and killed in front of St. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1750.657s">Joseph's</a>  not too long ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1752.798s">And</a>  these are the things that are happening in our community right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1757.794s">So,</a>  it's not like, well, if we don't do something, something's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1761.196s">It's</a>  currently happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1762.557s">We've</a>  had a number of pedestrian fatalities over the years in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1767.421s">And,</a>  you know, some of it is for the fact that we do very little enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1772.785s">We're</a>  talking about parking enforcement now, moving violations, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1777.828s">There</a>  was a spotlight, I think it was Channel 4 or Channel 5, did a spotlight about a year ago, and they listed 15 different communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1785.213s">And</a>  Method was the very last community <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1787.775s">on</a>  the number of moving violations issued out of all the surrounding communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1793.699s">You</a>  know, and some people might say, great, I won't get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1796.02s">I</a>  don't have to worry about getting a speeding ticket in Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1798.302s">Or</a>  when I go to a stop sign, I don't have to worry. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1800.383s">But</a>  that's not the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1801.584s">The</a>  case is pedestrian safety has to come first. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1804.866s">We</a>  have to take back our streets, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1808.028s">This</a>  is just one aspect of enforcement that needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1812.331s">When</a>  you see a street that doesn't take the time to paint their crosswalks, <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1816.31s">That</a>  sends a loud message to people that, you know what, pedestrian safety doesn't matter in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1822.392s">It</a>  doesn't matter that the crosswalks go unpainted. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1825.072s">It</a>  doesn't matter that there's no proper signage to indicate that there's a crosswalk in a particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1830.674s">You</a>  know, we had, the mayor promised us a couple years back, a pilot program to do three raised crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1839.336s">Now</a>  that's not a lot in a city this size. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1841.536s">The</a>  mayor implemented one on Winthrop Street, <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1845.214s">The</a>  other two on Central Ave and Harvard, they put speed bumps, not raised crosswalks, and then they removed the speed bumps, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1857.179s">I</a>  asked three times already for a response back from the administration and from DPW on what is the status of these raised crosswalks, which work great on traffic calming <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1870.291s">within</a>  the community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1872.053s">Widening</a>  sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1873.714s">These</a>  are things that can be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1876.057s">Putting</a>  markers in the road that appear to be 3D in nature, so when you're driving, you think you're coming up to something, and there's nothing there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1883.604s">But</a>  it allows the driver to slow down. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1887.768s">They</a>  do it in Cambridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1888.749s">We</a>  don't have to recreate the wheel. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1890.56s">These</a>  are things that are already being done, but this city, for whatever reason, Mr. President, you know, when we brought in Republic, it was to supplement the police department, not to take the duty of ticketing away from the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1904.489s">And</a>  that was understood from day one. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1906.471s">It</a>  was to supplement them. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1908.232s">And,</a>  you know, the police department now doesn't have to worry about the business districts and ticketing. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1913.055s">They</a>  should be in the neighborhoods going around and doing the proper enforcement, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1918.098s">And</a>  I just have to address, I think it was brought up by <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1920.967s">Councilor</a>  Falco or Councilor Caraviello about commercial vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1925.529s">I</a>  can only speak for my neighborhood, Mr. President, but there's a rash of commercial vehicles parking all over the roads, and heavy commercial vehicles, Mr. President, all over the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1937.093s">And</a>  it's a real concern in a neighborhood where you're paying $5,000, $6,000, $7,000 in property tax, and I have to look out at a truck that has 35 ladders on the top of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1947.956s">And</a>  furthermore, it's ripping all the branches off the tree, <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1950.757s">in</a>  front of the House. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1951.878s">I</a>  mean, these are the things that, for whatever reason, you know, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1956.882s">It</a>  just seems like no one cares in this community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1961.906s">It</a>  seems like no one cares. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1963.708s">And,</a>  you know, really, I think we should ask, and I know you have a lot on your plate. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1968.632s">There's</a>  a lot going on, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1970.493s">But</a>  I think we should ask for a public safety summit with the new administration, with the chief of police, with DPW, and go over these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1978.8s">Because</a>  we're the sounding board. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1979.981s">We</a>  get the emails constantly, like we got today, the pitches of Salt Method and the other circumstances going on in Harvard and Yale and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1989.887s">And</a>  these are the things we hear over and over again, and they never get resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=1994.489s">So</a>  I would ask, under your leadership, Mr. President — you can make a name for yourself now — under your leadership, let's start moving some of these issues forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2002.992s">So</a>  in a year from now, we won't have to say, well, it was the old President that never acted on these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2007.494s">We</a>  could say, no, we acted as a council to hold the administration and to hold the department heads accountable, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2015.137s">That's</a>  what we're here for. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2017.057s">So</a>  I would ask, Mr. President, that we set up <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2021.507s">public</a>  safety summit, Mr. President, with the chief of police, Sergeant Carroll, who's the head of traffic division, with the DPW, the new acting commissioner, Mr. Kerens, the administration, and whoever else wants to sit down, Mr. President, so we can discuss these important public safety issues, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2041.199s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2042.04s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2043.861s">And</a>  not only do you care, but I care, and Carvey cares, and all of us care. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2051.298s">Chair</a>  now recognizes Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2053.779s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2057.4s">Several</a>  months back when the chief was before us speaking about the rolling out of resident parking and the resident parking situation, he did make a representation that they were going to be looking at rolling out a citywide resident parking plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2069.144s">And</a>  I'd like to amend the paper, Mr. President, to request an update on the rollout of the citywide resident parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2074.945s">And</a>  I'd also like to point out that the mayor's office is conducting a survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2080.576s">relative</a>  to their constituent services and ways to better communicate between departments and with the community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2088.338s">And</a>  those surveys are available in room 204 here at City Hall, at the Senior Center, at the library, and online at the City of Medford's website. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2096.24s">And</a>  I think it's very important for us right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2097.8s">We</a>  have a very unique opportunity to help the mayor shape her vision of what we'd like to see Medford be. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2104.666s">And</a>  that's going to take participation from the community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2107.489s">So</a>  with that being said, I just wanted to be sure that everyone was aware that they do have that opportunity and option as well to voice their concern through the survey method.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2137.694s">Briefly,</a>  I just want to second the idea of a public safety summit, whether it's a committee, the whole meeting, I'd even take that, where the mayor is involved and the chief of police and the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2147.923s">So</a>  we can really decide and make changes so we can hear <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2153.034s">how</a>  our new administration is making changes with the chief of police and how we're going to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2158.396s">We</a>  cannot enforce the way we enforced prior to January 4, 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2164.878s">It</a>  just cannot happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2166.738s">It's</a>  not right for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2168.139s">It's</a>  not going to better the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2169.719s">We</a>  need enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2170.979s">And</a>  I think bringing everybody to the table probably will be best because today I have an issue with people parking on the sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2180.05s">But</a>  it involves enforcement in general and how we're going to move forward with enforcement, because I do remember the story, and I knew we were known for the no enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2189.297s">I</a>  forgot the major news stations picked up on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2192.74s">But,</a>  yes, I remember it clearly now, and it was embarrassing. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2197.043s">And</a>  I really hope that we can move forward, make changes, let the public know, give a warning time to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2206.531s">and</a>  do the things we need to do for the public's public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2210.392s">Somebody</a>  did get hurt. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2211.312s">Many</a>  people have gotten hurt and many more people will get hurt if we do not make some changes.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2216.233s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2216.633s">So</a>  on the motion of approved by council and night is seconded by a vice-president Lugo Kern as amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2222.055s">All</a>  those in favor roll call vote has been requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2225.076s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, if you would please call the roll council.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2313.63s">Chair</a>  recognizes councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2315.772s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2316.512s">You</a>  know, Mr. President, this has been a long, ongoing problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2320.576s">You</a>  know, the chief goes out and, you know, see something, say something. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2324.179s">Well,</a>  obviously this didn't take five minutes, two, three minutes to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2329.523s">And</a>  hundreds of cars go up and down Forest Street all day long. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2333.686s">I</a>  don't, I don't understand how, uh, no one saw people standing out there with <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2340.408s">10</a>  cans of spray paint painting over windows and on a fire escape and didn't see anything happening and didn't call the police. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2350.991s">And</a>  also, Mr. President, if you see down on the second photo, the dumpsters that are always out on Forest Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2361.674s">And</a>  right now they happen to be empty, but if you go by there on a Monday, they're full and it looks disgusting. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2368.383s">I'd</a>  ask that the owner of that building also come up with a gate or something to put over that so it doesn't look so unsightly. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2376.767s">I</a>  know the Board of Health has been down there multiple times and as you can see, to the right of the dumpster, you see multiple trash bags that are just sitting there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2389.111s">And</a>  there's a restaurant right next door. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2391.37s">So</a>  I'm sure that the Board of Health shouldn't condone that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2396.311s">But</a>  again, if there was a fence there, it would look a lot nicer. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2399.152s">But</a>  I don't know if we have a notice on our books that could force the owner of that building to clean up the graffiti that's there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2407.534s">It's</a>  very unsightly, Forest Street is a busy street, you get the post office there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2412.996s">And</a>  we're always talking about economic development, well, economic development doesn't <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2421.462s">call</a>  for graffiti art on buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2423.544s">So</a>  that's, uh, I would, I would motion that it goes to either the code enforcement officer, uh, I think to, uh, maybe have this cleaned up. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2432.952s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2433.292s">So</a>  on the motion for approval, uh, by Councilor Caraviello, all those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2436.515s">Mr.</a>  President.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2437.255s">Councilor.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2440.819s">I</a>  want, I want to thank Councilor Caraviello for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2443.481s">And,</a>  uh, you know, the ironic thing is if you look at the trash bin, it says, uh, there's a big sign on it says, go green. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2449.426s">Uh,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2450.068s">you</a>  know, with all the trash hanging out of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2452.711s">But</a>  needless to say, Mr. President, other communities, in Worcester in particular, have taken very creative ways of dealing with people that do graffiti. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2463.001s">You're</a>  never going to eradicate graffiti, but they've set up sections in their city and they've installed boards, maybe 10 by 20 boards. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2472.667s">in</a>  particular areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2473.967s">Some</a>  of them are in parks, some of them are in downtown business districts, and they allow these graffiti artists, and many of them consider themselves artists, to go and actually on a city-owned piece of wall, which they create, to go out and express themselves on this particular wall. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2492.713s">And</a>  they found out over years of looking at this and researching, <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2497.301s">that</a>  the number of graffiti incidences dropped, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2501.645s">And</a>  it was because the city took a proactive step in not saying, oh, we're going to go after these people. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2506.469s">We're</a>  going to put cameras everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2507.75s">We're</a>  going to arrest them. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2509.232s">But</a>  they got creative and said, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2511.474s">Why</a>  don't we erect our own wall? <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2512.995s">Why</a>  don't we invite these people? <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2514.877s">It's</a>  not illegal. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2515.657s">You</a>  can do it on this wall. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2516.978s">We're</a>  going to build you a wall. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2519.231s">And</a>  we're going to allow graffiti artists to go down anytime you want and put your own marking on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2524.573s">You</a>  can put your own fair, whatever you want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2526.853s">And</a>  guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2527.674s">It'll</a>  be covered over and covered over and covered over. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2530.254s">And</a>  it allows a freedom of expression, Mr. President, similar to what we allow the artist. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2535.896s">And</a>  I'm not comparing people that do tagging to our art population in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2541.378s">But</a>  last year, <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2543.481s">uh,</a>  the Mackey group got together and they did yard, uh, yarn bombing in many of the poles in the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2549.846s">I</a>  don't know if people saw it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2551.126s">They</a>  had yarn, all different color yarn wrapped up the pole. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2554.148s">And</a>  it just, it was, when you looked at it, it gave a sense of, uh, just pride, a sense of a homey type feeling. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2561.093s">It</a>  was just, it was great what they did. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2562.734s">They</a>  painted the electrical boxes around the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2565.976s">And</a>  these are the things, Mr. President, maybe if we reached out to, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2569.978s">You</a>  know, we're able to unite with some of these taggers and reach out. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2573.619s">Maybe</a>  they could do some good in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2575.6s">And</a>  maybe we could put them to work on doing some nice painting on our hydrants or other boxes that are owned by the city and not create this adversarial type thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2586.324s">And</a>  like I said, it's never going to go away, but it's a suggestion, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2590.446s">It's</a>  all it is, is a suggestion, something I think we can look at maybe as a council and offer the recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2596.969s">You</a>  know what, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2598.914s">I</a>  offered two resolutions recently to take a look at the tea shelter on Riverside Avenue Square across from the old McDonald's. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2611.781s">And</a>  I'm proud to say, Mr. President, I asked in several resolutions to repurpose that area that really is being used for nothing in the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2621.126s">It's</a>  dilapidated. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2622.387s">The</a>  tiles on the roof are coming down. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2626.989s">The</a>  facade is falling apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2628.918s">And</a>  to turn this into a repurpose, multi-purpose area for outdoor performances, to maybe even have a board where taggers can go down and have an area for that such activity, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2642.824s">And</a>  I'm proud to say that this is sitting administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2646.686s">The</a>  new mayor has picked up on the suggestion and is having a public meeting on the Riverside Ave Plaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2653.889s">And</a>  it says anyone in Method submitting an application <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2656.998s">I'm</a>  sorry, it says the City of Medford is submitting an application to the Mass Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs, Department of Conservation Services for funding under the Land and Water Conservation Grant Program to be used for the rehabilitation of Riverside Ave Plaza area in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2675.143s">Mayor</a>  Stephanie Buccini-Burke invites you to give your input prior to the submission of the application. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2680.445s">So</a>  Thursday, February 4th, <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2683.337s">At</a>  6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2684.637s">here</a>  in the chambers, they will have a meeting to discuss any possible uses of that particular area, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2694.745s">And</a>  I'm glad to see that this current administration is actually looking at things that are offered by the council and acting upon them, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2704.212s">So</a>  if anyone's interested in the repurposing of this particular area, I would recommend Thursday, February 4th at 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2711.593s">here</a>  in the chamber at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2713.594s">And</a>  I want to thank the administration, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2716.636s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2717.336s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2718.017s">And</a>  your committee for the distribution of linkage funds has funded this effort on behalf of the citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2730.464s">We</a>  have a motion for approval as amended by Councilor Marks to send this note of recommendation to <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2738.478s">The</a>  Transition Committee for Culture and Recreation.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2743.603s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2744.544s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello will sum up this item before we take a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2748.087s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2749.028s">Again,</a>  Mr. President, I don't know, but when you drive down Mystic Avenue, in Somerville, on the highway wall, they have put up boards like Councilor Marksley suggested, and you see art on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2760.719s">And</a>  if you get down by the new assembly on the underpass there, <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2764.821s">The</a>  trend there, there's boards there that people have done art and makes it look a lot nicer. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2770.543s">And</a>  I've seen it in other cities, where they're done on the highways, they're done on the underpasses, where they're unsightly, and this brings it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2778.745s">And</a>  I also want to thank the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2781.145s">I</a>  know Councilor Marx has brought this forward on a couple of different years for finally bringing this up, and for her <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2791.828s">having</a>  a meeting on the 4th. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2792.889s">So</a>  I hope everyone will attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2794.791s">On</a>  the motion for approval, Mr. Citizen, please state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2798.934s">Welcome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2799.695s">My</a>  name is Michael Ruggiero. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2800.616s">I</a>  live on 18 Pembroke Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2802.357s">Um,</a>  I love the idea of Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2804.339s">I've</a>  seen it done successfully in a number of cities, Los Angeles included. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2808.583s">Uh,</a>  but my concern involves more than just the idea of getting a wall to make sure that <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2813.643s">people</a>  can express themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2815.384s">My</a>  concern is that if we have a parks department that has trouble emptying trash cans, responding to people that leave when the park lights are left on all night, needles that are sometimes found in parks. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2828.489s">My</a>  concern is broader. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2830.069s">If</a>  we can't have a park system that addresses these major problems, perhaps a wall with some interesting art on it might not suffice. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2839.173s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2840.221s">On</a>  the motion for approval, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2842.582s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2844.002s">Motion</a>  carries. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2845.323s">While</a>  we're in suspension, continuing, 16-043 offered by Councilor Caraviello, be it resolved that the Medford City Council request the Massachusetts State Police increase enforcement on Mystic Valley Parkway and Auburn Street for vehicles making the illegal left-hand turn onto Auburn Street both during the morning and evening rush hour times. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2865.369s">We</a>  also ask that the Medford Police increase enforcement <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2868.257s">on</a>  Auburn and Prescott Street area during the same period, as drivers use these streets as the shortcut to avoid parkway traffic.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2878.523s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2879.564s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2880.605s">Mr.</a>  President, you know, the problem of taking that left after the Whole Foods, it's not a new problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2886.889s">It's</a>  been going on for probably 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2890.971s">And</a>  in the past, there has been enforcement there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2894.093s">But</a>  I've not seen a state trooper there, and I lived in that area in many, many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2898.434s">And</a>  I'd say, especially during that morning and the evening rush hour, when the parkway is backed up down the Dillwood Field there, people are just cutting off, thinking they're getting a shortcut when they really not. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2911.276s">And</a>  there's stop signs at Auburn Street and Prescott right at the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2917.297s">And</a>  people don't even adhere to the stop signs anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2921.578s">They're</a>  cutting down Prescott Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2924.292s">during</a>  these rush hour times. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2925.512s">And</a>  again, there's stop signs on all these streets, and people just go right through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2930.093s">If</a>  you stand out there and you yell at them, they ignore you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2933.934s">They</a>  make obscene gestures to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2936.014s">And</a>  there's children in that neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2937.375s">It's</a>  a school area. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2938.935s">And</a>  like I said, I ask that we call the state police and step up some enforcement over there on that illegal turn. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2947.317s">And</a>  also, if the Medford police could do a little enforcement over by the school during those rush hour times, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2967.276s">Thank</a>  you, President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2969.697s">We</a>  always have complaints with regards to speeding, and my neighbor, who lives on Highland Ave, has complained to me recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2978.762s">The</a>  speeding on Highland Ave is out of control. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2984.245s">If</a>  we could get an increased enforcement, whether that's some ticketing, <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2989.768s">That</a>  would be very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2991.449s">I</a>  know there was a near miss recently that was witnessed by my neighbor. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=2995.592s">And</a>  this is just one other thing that does need some enforcing, if I could amend that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3003.958s">And</a>  also, I know we have the electronic sign that's kind of as a traffic calming approach, if we could get that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3010.083s">Number</a>  one, get that out, whether that's for a week or two on Highland Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3014.206s">But</a>  also see if our department can <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3018.263s">do</a>  a couple traps in the area that, I believe it's 25, and you have people go in almost 50. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3023.945s">It's</a>  almost a speedway on Highland Ave as you head into Maldon, Woodland Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3032.107s">So</a>  if we could do that, it would be greatly appreciated.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3047.972s">If</a>  I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3049.593s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3052.474s">We</a>  also amend that the chief also look at the speeding issues on Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3058.816s">And</a>  we're realizing that neighbors have called that they're cut through from Salem Street to the Fellsway and using the streets on the left of going toward Malden. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3072.902s">Cutting</a>  through Cherry Street is probably one of the biggest <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3076.367s">streets</a>  that they're using as a cut-through, Power Street, Cherry Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3081.19s">And</a>  the other one is on Spring Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3085.293s">They're</a>  using, after the satellites, where the Super Red is. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3090.937s">That's</a>  an area of concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3092.598s">So</a>  I think that, and I know that I appreciate Councilor Brianna, my current focusing on the speed machine, this tracking, so really deter the speeding. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3104.986s">So</a>  if we can amend that, <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3106.502s">Those</a>  two areas, too, I'd appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3108.003s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3108.543s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3109.044s">So</a>  as amended by Councilor Scott Palac to include Salem Street, Cherry, and Spring, one of the efforts that made quite a difference on Harvard Street was the installation of solar-powered speed tracking devices, which worked quite well. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3127.555s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Haynes.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3129.596s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3132.958s">Over</a>  in the city of Malden, right at the Highland Ave line, along the Fellsway, there is a crazy rotary right down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3140.101s">It's</a>  a backwards rotary, actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3142.323s">It</a>  operates in reverse. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3143.583s">So</a>  you normally would drive through a rotary. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3145.824s">It's</a>  supposed to yield at this location, right at the foot of Highland Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3149.206s">And</a>  it's been brought to my understanding that Councilman Matheson and Secretary Pollack at the Department of Transportation have been discussing a traffic study relative to the redesign of that intersection, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3162.913s">And</a>  I think it might be beneficial to us to request an update or have our DPW director or our office of engineering request an update as to the discussions that are going on between the state and the city of Malden relative to the changes at the Rotary because they will certainly have a large impact on the traffic patterns that are going to back up into Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3179.699s">Maybe</a>  the positive impacts, maybe the negative, until we know what's going on, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3184.063s">I</a>  really am not comfortable commenting, and that's why I'm asking for an update.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3187.347s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3187.767s">So</a>  as amended by Councilor Knight on the May motion, as amended by Councilor Langley-Curran and also Councilor Schapiro. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3195.447s">The</a>  chair recognizes the citizen at the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3197.748s">Welcome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3198.428s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3200.348s">Martin.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3273.996s">Just</a>  also, if we could add enforcement, Mr. President, at the intersection of Park and Doonan.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3319.302s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3320.723s">I</a>  think two weeks ago, maybe longer, we asked for a report from Republic on the parking after one full year, and I don't think it takes three weeks to get a report from them. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3333.789s">I</a>  don't know where it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3334.909s">But</a>  also, Mr. President, I think this council needs to sit down with Republic and discuss the practices that they're using in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3344.285s">Some</a>  are good, some are bad, and let's amend some of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3349.007s">I</a>  mean, I know we have some people in the audience that are going to want to speak about this thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3352.629s">But</a>  again, they're not a very customer service friendly company, and I think that needs to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3360.253s">If</a>  they're going to be here for the next seven or eight years, ten years, nine more years, I think that's something that needs to be discussed, and how they're going to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3370.999s">Otherwise,</a>  it's not going to work out for the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3374.413s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3375.494s">Good</a>  evening.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3383.9s">Welcome.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3384.661s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3385.081s">I</a>  would like to say, President de la Ruzo, thank you for calling me back today. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3389.464s">I'd</a>  like to thank Councilman Cavallaro, Marks, and Scappelli, who all emailed me back today, so I really appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3398.511s">I</a>  live at 23 Marion Street and in October we received a letter stating that they were turning our street to permit parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3407.518s">My</a>  understanding, the reason for doing this is because we've had a lot of issues with the church, which I live next to. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3413.962s">And</a>  we've had, well, people were concerned about the T coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3417.883s">So</a>  that was my understanding from the hearings that I went to, to hear about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3421.803s">So</a>  I had no problem with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3423.104s">I'm</a>  perfectly fine with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3424.504s">I</a>  own my home. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3425.324s">I</a>  pay my bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3426.424s">I</a>  follow the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3427.964s">And</a>  I said, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3428.845s">I</a>  agree it's an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3430.245s">So</a>  I went in the middle of October down to Park Medford, and I purchased a parking pass for my vehicle. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3435.866s">They</a>  were out of passes, but they were going to scan our plate. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3439.526s">So</a>  we had to give our plate information. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3441.127s">We</a>  didn't get a sticker. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3443.211s">So</a>  I thought, you know what, I'm okay with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3445.592s">I</a>  dealt with a woman named Pam down there, very nice lady, was willing to talk and was very good. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3453.196s">January</a>  2nd, I come out of my house and I have a parking ticket on my car. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3458.239s">I</a>  drove down to Park Medford, I go in, I'm like, Pam, what is this ticket? <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3463.438s">So</a>  basically, I was told at that time that the parking pass that I purchased in the middle of November was only good until the last day of December. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3473.164s">I</a>  was expected to go back January 1st to buy another parking pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3478.708s">At</a>  that time, I said, that just really doesn't feel very good to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3484.251s">I</a>  am really bothered by this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3486.092s">So</a>  I went down and I talked to Pam. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3487.954s">Pam</a>  told me that I needed to go through Chief Sacco, who I know because I've also done a lot of work in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3493.756s">I</a>  call down, Chief Sacco's on vacation, I talk to Alba. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3498.4s">She</a>  tells me that the chief really has nothing to do with it, I need to deal with Park Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3503.184s">I</a>  go back down to Park Medford, I talk to Pam again. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3508.584s">Again,</a>  very nice, and said, well, yeah, I thought it was him, so maybe you should go to the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3514.469s">So</a>  I call up to the mayor's office, I speak with, I believe her name was Lauren, but Stephanie also at another time, explained the situation, and my impression was with our new mayor, that was part of her platform in this election campaign was helping to fix the issues of Medford with the parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3532.676s">So</a>  they were both very nice, let's check into it, we will get back to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3537.646s">Didn't</a>  hear back, so I called back and basically was told that the mayor's office has nothing to do with it, that I needed to deal with Park Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3545.332s">At</a>  that time, I went back to Park Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3547.453s">I'd</a>  become very good friends with Pam and the other staff down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3551.574s">And</a>  again, she couldn't have been any nicer. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3553.255s">And</a>  she said, I have to present this to Jim. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3556.356s">I</a>  need to talk to Jim. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3557.476s">I</a>  didn't know who Dan was at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3560.177s">So</a>  she said, I'll get back to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3562.398s">A</a>  couple days later, I hadn't heard back. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3564.098s">I</a>  went back down, talked to her. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3565.359s">She</a>  said, I haven't gotten to him yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3567.159s">I</a>  went down the next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3568.4s">She</a>  said, I'm getting to him tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3570.16s">She</a>  got to him. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3571.661s">Then</a>  she tells me, sorry, that's their policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3573.802s">We're</a>  not doing anything about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3575.58s">So</a>  I went back down and I talked to Pam. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3579.142s">And</a>  I don't want to get anybody in trouble, but it's been interesting because in the stream of offices that I've talked to, everybody's comment has been, that is ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3590.25s">And</a>  it is ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3591.831s">We're</a>  talking about a $10 parking pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3594.013s">And</a>  to be honest with you, this has nothing to do with the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3596.915s">This</a>  has to do with the fact that I purchased a pass the middle of November. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3601.176s">that</a>  it should have been prorated, something. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3603.68s">But</a>  the fact that I have to buy another one for January now, all the vehicles in my house are in our driveway and that's where they will stay. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3612.297s">I</a>  feel like I don't know where to go with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3614.298s">I</a>  feel like I'm getting nowhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3616.94s">My</a>  husband and I have talked about this endlessly. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3620.263s">I</a>  had a conversation, I have three adult children and their friends were over for dinner a couple of weeks ago and this topic came up around the dining room table. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3629.11s">And</a>  I had six young adults in their 20s saying to me, why even bother? <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3633.833s">Just</a>  pay it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3634.734s">It's</a>  going to get you nowhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3636.315s">It</a>  was amazing to me that not one of them knew who any of you were <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3640.198s">Didn't</a>  have any interest in politics and basically we're sitting there saying to me you can't fight City Hall It doesn't matter if it's not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3647.361s">Nobody's</a>  gonna listen to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3648.961s">You're</a>  gonna go in front of the council They're gonna say okay, and you're gonna hear nothing and I want to prove them wrong because I do have faith in you all I have faith that you will do something about this and I'm sitting listening to the other issues in this audience feeling <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3663.666s">that</a>  my issue is so trivial that I should just go pay my $10 and not bother your time because President, I do not envy your position. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3672.28s">Sitting</a>  here for one evening, I do not envy your position. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3675.165s">But</a>  gentlemen, <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3676.985s">Their</a>  issue is large. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3678.346s">My</a>  issue has become one that I've talked to many neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3682.207s">Many</a>  people don't want to step forward because they're fearing some type of retaliation from the city or the police are going to earmark them. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3688.35s">And</a>  I wouldn't have gone this far if I didn't get such a negative reaction from people about what our community could do. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3694.793s">I</a>  don't have any issue with enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3697.214s">I</a>  don't have any issue with the sticker. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3698.774s">I</a>  don't have any issue with all of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3700.715s">My</a>  only issue is that they charged me a month and a half <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3705.385s">They</a>  charged me a month and a half when I should have had it for a year, and now I'm expected to buy a new one. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3712.137s">Oh,</a>  and then, just so you are aware because you've been discussing this issue, I believe that ticket information is public knowledge, public information, that's what I thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3723.303s">I</a>  said to Jim, I have never seen anybody ticketing on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3727.945s">Through</a>  November, through December, apparently there is a white box truck that Park Medford drives around in. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3735.409s">I</a>  talked to Pam on January 2nd and said, you know what, I can't pull in my driveway half the time because of the church. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3741.548s">I</a>  can't make the angle to get in because they're parked so close. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3744.871s">I</a>  deal with the church on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3746.473s">I</a>  don't want to bother you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3747.394s">I</a>  mean, there's certain things to not bother you with. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3749.676s">But</a>  he wouldn't produce any tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3751.938s">And</a>  then he said, oh, there's been some written. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3754.24s">And</a>  I said, listen, I've talked to many neighbours. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3756.502s">There</a>  have not been tickets issued November and December. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3760.326s">Jim</a>  says there have been. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3761.407s">Maybe</a>  there have been a few, but not for the issue of the permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3765.01s">I'm</a>  very discouraged. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3766.431s">I'm</a>  very sad by this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3767.712s">I</a>  would really love somebody to do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3771.155s">For</a>  all of you, I'm grateful you're here and you're fighting your cause because your issue is a little bigger than mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3776.439s">But</a>  mine is on principle that I don't want to buy another parking sticker for a year when I just bought it in November. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3782.904s">So</a>  thank you, gentlemen. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3784.125s">And</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3791.371s">The</a>  chair recognizes Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3793.763s">Thank</a>  you, Linda, for coming out. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3796.144s">I'm</a>  going to, maybe publicly, I'll come over for dinner, invite those same six kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3801.865s">I'd</a>  love to come over and talk with them and get involved, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3805.766s">Yeah,</a>  well, I can imagine. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3807.326s">But</a>  as we talk about these issues, I think one of the biggest things that we see, and I know that through your email and many emails, I think it's important that we talk about its transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3820.13s">The</a>  lack of <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3822.395s">of</a>  knowledge of what to do, where to go, who to talk to. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3826.198s">It's</a>  confusing. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3827.559s">I'm</a>  a city councilman and I question myself as I read into this more and we talk about the parking process and the whole permit parking and where the equity comes into play. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3839.808s">Where</a>  in some neighborhoods where there's what was said earlier, parking permits that people are paying for but reliable, they don't have to go to that area because it's not <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3852.164s">meet</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3852.744s">So</a>  they don't need to enforce that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3855.526s">I</a>  do have friends that live right at the corner, actually right across the street from the, um, from the church. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3861.329s">And</a>  I know that's a huge issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3863.01s">Um,</a>  but again, I think this has to go back to, um, meeting, having follow up with Councilor Marks as, as stated earlier, and bringing this up at, at a, at a forum where these should all be talked about and put out and answered by both reliable, the police chief, <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3881.138s">and</a>  a traffic commission so that we can get an understanding of the frustrations we hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3887.307s">I</a>  mean, this is, you know, I wrote a bunch of different questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3891.272s">After</a>  six, do we know that <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3894.27s">What</a>  are the rules that after six and on the weekends? <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3896.853s">I</a>  know that was brought up.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3898.154s">I'm</a>  so sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3899.275s">I</a>  apologize for coming back up, but that was the other issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3902.158s">You're</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3902.598s">I</a>  discovered that the Park Medford tickets Monday through Friday between eight and six.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3908.003s">Right,</a>  and the church is all weekend.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3909.204s">The</a>  church doesn't start till 630 at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3911.566s">Tuesday,</a>  Thursday, and even Friday, you can't even move. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3914.729s">So</a>  I had said that to Pam. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3916.511s">That</a>  was the first night I saw the Medford Parks <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3920.895s">And</a>  it was at five of six. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3922.576s">Nobody</a>  was at the church. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3923.597s">At</a>  630, hundreds of people flew in. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3925.659s">And</a>  then when I talked to the police department, because I know people at the police department, the police will ticket only in the middle of the night, and they just want residents on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3934.606s">So</a>  they're not ticketing for the church. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3936.167s">They're</a>  not ticketing on the weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3938.129s">So</a>  that is another issue, with all due respect.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3940.811s">So</a>  as I move forward, again, I looked at your neighboring communities and how they do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3948.588s">having</a>  that centralized traffic and parking office, and having the hearing officer that you can actually talk to. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3954.992s">And</a>  maybe it's not, you don't get the answer that you want, but at least you're talking to someone, the answer's final, and you're not running back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3965.178s">I</a>  can only imagine how frustrating that was. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3967.88s">The</a>  other issue is we talk about permits and the revenue that the city creates through parking permits. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3977.194s">Now,</a>  does that mean Reliable now gets all of the permits? <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3980.738s">Is</a>  that, maybe someone can enlighten me, Mr. President, but now that permits, when I lived in West Medford, the permits, we came to City Hall, purchased our parking permit, and that revenue came back to the city somehow. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=3994.391s">Now,</a>  if this goes to Reliable, not only are they writing tickets, they're also making, are they making the revenue for the permits?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4001.98s">I</a>  don't know the answer to that, uh, Councilor, but if you would like to amend this motion to get that question as part of the report that we've requested now for the second time, I'm sure that that information will be forthcoming within the coming century.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4017.865s">I</a>  appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4018.486s">And</a>  if we can also add to that amendment, um, the, uh, better outline and who to address concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4026.628s">I</a>  know I went online today, uh, and I went through the whole process you tried to go through and I found it <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4031.798s">very</a>  disheartening. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4033.119s">So,</a>  and again, this falls back and sitting in front of people that can answer these questions and having the stakeholders involved, which again, I'm going to revert back to Councilor Marks and his, his opinion with having that summit. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4046.364s">I</a>  think it's going to be very important both for public knowledge and a little finalization here with some of these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4054.567s">So</a>  again, I apologize that you had to go through such a ordeal and, and, but I can, I can see why so. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4061.644s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4062.845s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4064.345s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Caraviello, as amended by Councilor Scarpelli, the chair recognizes Madam Vice President Brianna Longo-Kerr.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4074.19s">Thank</a>  you, President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4075.711s">If</a>  I could ask Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4077.272s">Kelly</a>  a question about when Marion Street got changed to permit parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4084.795s">Was</a>  that actually in November 2015?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4086.136s">Through</a>  the chair, you may ask any question you'd like.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4092.474s">We</a>  received the notice mid-October that the street was going permit parking by the middle of, by November 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4102.738s">And</a>  I didn't even make it down until approximately the second week. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4107.38s">And</a>  many neighbors didn't even go then because nobody was ticketing.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4110.481s">So</a>  obviously within that, so where did that notice come from that came from the traffic commission or? <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4115.704s">Came</a>  from, was it?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4118.543s">No,</a>  it was the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4121.345s">City</a>  of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4121.986s">It</a>  was the city of Medford because they had mentioned, that's why I was going, that they were only responsible for sending out the letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4129.612s">That's</a>  what I was told, that they're not involved with what PAC, PARC, Medford policies are.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4134.695s">And</a>  within the letter it didn't mention anything with regards to time frames of when to get the permit and when you'll need to renew your permit?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4140.7s">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4141.582s">I</a>  mean, just as one councillor, I think that's where the problem lies. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4145.003s">Number</a>  one, we don't know where in the city of Medford you got that letter from. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4149.824s">Number</a>  two, the department that they got the letter from obviously did not educate you on the topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4156.546s">So</a>  we need to set policies that are gonna make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4160.307s">So</a>  whether it be, like you said, prorated or just more education to the person who lives on Marion Street, <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4170.22s">Even</a>  if you knew that, it might have made more sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4172.642s">You</a>  might have said to yourself, oh, I'll park in our driveway till January 1st, then I'll get my permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4178.906s">I'm</a>  not going to go up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4180.167s">It's</a>  more, and I understand, it's not the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4182.188s">You</a>  have to go up, you have to, you know, fill out the documentation, write out a check, pay the $10, and then they want you to do it a month and a half later. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4189.293s">I</a>  think not knowing is the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4191.174s">So</a>  we need to set policies and procedures that make sense.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4199.158s">And</a>  I will never say who that was because they were all very nice to me and were very excited I was fighting this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4205.628s">But</a>  that was the phrase one of the employees used, that this is a money grab.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4212.453s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4212.953s">And</a>  I'd also like to... Please state your name and address. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4216.014s">I'm</a>  sorry, my name is Michael Pawinski, 23 Marion Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4219.574s">Welcome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4220.995s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli, I think you hit the nail on the head, is the transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4225.515s">And</a>  Councilor Luongo-King, we don't know who's sending these. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4229.936s">We</a>  don't know who to go to. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4231.276s">We</a>  don't know who to fight this with. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4233.497s">And</a>  just a few answers is all we're asking for, that's all. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4238.358s">And</a>  I thank you for your time.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4239.558s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4242.013s">I</a>  would request that anybody whose street changed to permit parking after mid-half of the year, so July 1st and on, that their new parking permit come 2016 be prorated, that they get, whether it's a half-price permit or that they get their money back for 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4263.089s">I</a>  think we need to do something to set precedent to say we made a mistake and we need to make things right. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4269.699s">I</a>  also think that those letters that go out, once a street turns into permit parking, which I believe comes from the Traffic Commission, we need to set the precedent to let the public know, let our residents know, this is the procedure, this is when you have to get your parking permit, and this is when you're going to have to renew your parking permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4288.143s">It</a>  just makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4289.783s">Like</a>  Councilor Scarpelli said, transparency, educating the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4294.924s">If</a>  people know what to expect, it isn't a shocker, it isn't a pain. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4299.318s">You</a>  know, people understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4300.399s">They</a>  can make arrangements. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4301.839s">But</a>  to — this — it's just so frustrating. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4306.622s">It</a>  really is frustrating. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4308.343s">And</a>  I — and I hope — you know, we — I think the administration is going to make these changes and many, many more. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4314.466s">I</a>  know it's only been three and a half, four weeks, but I hope these changes come sooner than later so that these minuscule things that frustrate people to no end can be resolved.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4325.332s">The</a>  President Thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4329.028s">The</a>  chair recognizes Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4332.31s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4333.351s">I</a>  just want to thank Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4334.432s">Kelly</a>  for coming up here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4336.813s">I</a>  can feel your frustration on this and I'm a little surprised by the response you got from the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4345.559s">Chief</a>  Sacco has been the face of this program and anyone that would be involved in implementing policy change or having some involvement in this would be Chief Sacco and the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4358.161s">And</a>  if it's not him, it would be the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4361.602s">So</a>  for them to say they have no involvement in it, I really find that troubling. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4367.884s">Because</a>  as Councilor Lungo-Koehn just mentioned, this is an easy fix to either prorate a ticket or come up with a better solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4377.488s">I</a>  realize the permit parking stickers change colors, and that's why they have to issue new stickers every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4386.845s">And</a>  for a period of time, they weren't even issuing stickers because of an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4392.306s">All</a>  right, there was an issue with people going out to a nightclub and being followed home because the sticker had your address on it at one point. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4399.968s">Well,</a>  and so they changed the whole process. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4402.609s">And</a>  now they went back to stickers because it was hard for a resident who would look outside their home and say, this car's been out here for three days. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4411.511s">If</a>  it didn't have a sticker, you assumed that they weren't permit parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4416.441s">But</a>  when they did away with the stickers, there was no way of assuming that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4419.342s">So,</a>  that's why they went back to the stickers. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4420.983s">But</a>  I think 99.9 percent of this is just common sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4426.186s">If</a>  I was the head of Park Method and someone came in, like yourself, and came in and said, we just had our street changed over in October. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4432.969s">I</a>  just got the sticker in November. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4435.27s">I</a>  didn't realize I had to up it and I got a ticket in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4438.632s">That's</a>  just basic common sense as a manager, as an administrator that would say, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4444.775s">Give</a>  me the ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4445.773s">Don't</a>  worry about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4446.893s">Tell</a>  your neighbors, don't worry about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4449.274s">There's</a>  this, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4456.436s">Well,</a>  that's good to hear that he wiped out the tickets, but I think it's just common sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4462.597s">And</a>  I think we lose touch in this day and age with all everything electronic and, you know, the face-to-face is gone now. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4470.199s">And</a>  it's unfortunate that an issue like this that could be resolved in a second <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4475.278s">You</a>  had to take so many hours to go talk to the mayor's office and the chief and come up here that could have been resolved immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4482.183s">And</a>  as Councilor Knight mentioned, the chief said he was working on creating a citywide resident permit parking system, in effect, that may be by wards, by precinct, that stickers issued. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4499.154s">And</a>  I know they've been working on that for some time, and I'm hoping that comes about because <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4505.032s">There's</a>  no reason why certain streets have resident permit parking and other streets don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4509.913s">And</a>  you can only park on your street. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4511.294s">You</a>  can't park on the next street over. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4514.075s">You</a>  know, so there's a lot of issues that need to be addressed, but I appreciate you coming up here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4518.496s">And</a>  I'm not sure what we can, it is a policy decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4523.517s">And</a>  to me, there should be a policy out there that states, you know, as Councilor Longo said, maybe if you get a ticket, a sticker six months into the, <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4533.533s">to</a>  the year, they prorate it, or they give you a sheet with your sticker saying, don't forget, this runs out, begins January 1st, runs out December 31st. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4545.884s">And</a>  that way you're on the hook if something happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4547.725s">At</a>  least they notified you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4549.907s">So</a>  I appreciate you coming up tonight.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4553.07s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knox. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4554.291s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4556.203s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4557.544s">I'd</a>  like to amend the paper before us by way of a B paper that would read, Mr. President, whereas Marion Street became permit parking in November in the 2015 permit parking stickers were valid only for six weeks, that these permits maintain their validity through the end of 2016.</p>

    <p>[jCO6jvvXtn0_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4572.854s">Name</a>  is Nick Tomaszuk, 29 Garfield Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4585.404s">Not</a>  to get off of what I'm trying to say, but they could have issued the next year's pocket sticker. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4592.047s">That</a>  would have avoided the whole problem that she had. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4597.15s">You</a>  know, yeah, but I'm saying when she went up in November, give her the 2016 sticker. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4603.853s">It's</a>  only two months. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4605.854s">It</a>  would have eliminated so many problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4608.796s">But</a>  my point is, is the biggest <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4611.873s">The</a>  big parking problem is these people that park on these side streets and get on the bus to go to Haymarket. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4620.78s">There's</a>  a lot of that going around. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4624.763s">I</a>  mean, so if you give, you know, like a resident, like Medford resident sticker, that would avoid some of those problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4634.631s">Because</a>  there's like multi-families on my street, so everybody owns a couple of cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4639.707s">So</a>  a triple deck is going to have six cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4641.628s">Where</a>  are you going to put them all? <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4643.988s">The</a>  street's only a block long. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4645.929s">And</a>  they still find a space to put their cars there and get on a 326 bus to go into the Haymarket. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4653.471s">So</a>  there has to be some kind of a system to stop it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4657.011s">I</a>  mean, they could pay and park right here and get on the bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4660.692s">But</a>  it's better to park on the side street. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=4663.726s">Feel</a>  free.</p>

<a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5043.323s">Massachusetts</a>  general laws do not prohibit green and natural burials, which is something I'm going to be talking a little bit about. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5050.806s">Green</a>  burials do not cause disease to anyone or problems for the cemetery. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5057.248s">Oak</a>  Grove Cemetery is contiguous with Brooks Estate land. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5060.369s">Groundwater</a>  from the cemetery must at times drain into Brooks Estate land. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5064.771s">Brooks</a>  Estate is a protected conservation area. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5067.451s">Therefore,</a>  we should allow burials that are 100% conservation conscious. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5073.735s">Okay,</a>  so that was an abbreviated script, and I would like you now to please listen to mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5081.578s">And</a>  I only have a rough draft because this wasn't decided until last night, and I just really have not time to make it more concise. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5093.023s">So</a>  I apologize, but I hope you won't find it boring. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5098.69s">The</a>  concerns I bring to the council meeting tonight is a focus on preservation and fairness to all, especially related to the burial at Oak Grove Cemetery. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5108.893s">First,</a>  I tell you I have spent much of my life here in Medford, as many of my relatives have. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5115.614s">I</a>  attended grade school through high school in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5118.315s">I've</a>  attended services at almost every church and synagogue. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5121.836s">And</a>  I've attended classes and functions and used the libraries at Tufts College. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5126.274s">My</a>  husband and I have worked as substitute teachers in the Medford school system, and we've done other assignments as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5135.017s">Tonight,</a>  I bring attention to our concern for our historic and beautiful cemetery, Oak Grove Cemetery, and the Brooks Estate, which lies side by side in West Medford, and both border the large pond in the Brooks Estate. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5151.211s">I</a>  bring before you several urgent questions a growing number of Medford citizens and taxpayers have been asking. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5160.159s">One</a>  is the question of use at Oak Grove Cemetery for burial by the citizens of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5169.688s">My</a>  understanding is the cemetery's decisions are made by a group of three trustees selected by the mayor <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5177.479s">and</a>  perhaps other elected officials. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5180.041s">There's</a>  a cemetery manager who manages and directs the affairs of Oak Grove, but does not have a vote with the trustees. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5187.486s">The</a>  cemetery is regulated by Mass General Laws, MGL, Massachusetts, which are Massachusetts state laws, and local laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5196.532s">There</a>  are bylaws the cemetery follows, which can and should be examined and perhaps changed to suit the various needs of Medford residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5207.845s">Can</a>  you hear me okay, Rick? <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5209.926s">Can</a>  you hear me now? <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5211.267s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5220.913s">These</a>  are some of the questions we asked tonight, and there will be more to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5226.437s">It</a>  has been suggested that an advisory board be established from among concerned residents to reflect the various needs and choices in burial preferences. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5235.523s">We</a>  asked that an advisory board be established and we wondered if that can be done tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5243.45s">Is</a>  there a requirement of open meeting laws to be held, open meeting laws to be held in public or can the trustees deliberate on their own and make private decisions? <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5254.676s">without</a>  input from the taxpayers? <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5257.197s">Is</a>  there an appeal process if the trustees vote against a request made by an owner of a gravesite and or by a Medford citizen who wishes to purchase a grave? <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5268.0s">We</a>  understand many of the questions may be answered by our city solicitor, Mark Rumley. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5274.882s">Residents</a>  with green burial concerns had a meeting with Attorney Rumley, who was asked about the laws regarding the personal choice of citizens who desire to have what is known as a green or natural burial, which does not use toxins involved in embalming and cremation and cement vaults. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5295.46s">This</a>  is especially relevant to a growing awareness of preservation of health for people of all faiths and all living things. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5303.965s">Also,</a>  the process of embalming and cremation is a choice many wish to avoid for personal and faith reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5312.675s">Mark</a>  Rumley stated under MGL laws, Mass General Laws, that Oak Grove Cemetery would be allowed to offer natural or green burials. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5322.077s">There</a>  is nothing to stop them except their vote in favor of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5326.337s">There</a>  is nothing in MGL's Mass General Laws to prevent Oak Grove from offering this as a choice to those who wish for this type of burial. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5334.419s">We</a>  ask that an area suitable for this type of burial would be offered to those in Medford <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5341.54s">who</a>  desire it for personal or faith reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5344.421s">We</a>  ask the City Council to make this an urgent concern for a large aging population here, of which I am one, and for unexpected deaths. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5353.483s">This</a>  is known as death care. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5357.865s">Local</a>  community cemeteries in Arlington and Melrose and elsewhere are working to make green or natural burials a reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5365.947s">It</a>  would be wonderful if the City of Medford showed this concern <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5369.49s">for</a>  the fast-growing movement of natural burials from Medford residents who are asking for it and want to be buried in their hometown. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5383.258s">Jean</a>  just asked me, when she heard me, what I was going to talk about, what about the health concerns? <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5389.282s">And</a>  she thought that was a question many would have. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5392.764s">We</a>  had a meeting with the cemetery board, let's see, a few weeks ago, and we had a speaker <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5399.358s">who</a>  is an expert in this field, who works at Mount Auburn Cemetery, a private cemetery in Cambridge, and she's a horticulturist. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5409.325s">She</a>  explained how there is no disease concern from natural burials. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5415.108s">In</a>  fact, there's more concern from unnatural burials, which would be the other types of burials that I mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5423.654s">And</a>  so that's a concern many people have, and it's not really a reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5428.674s">to</a>  be concerned about. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5430.354s">And</a>  I think that's all I have.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5468.509s">Thank</a>  you, President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5470.211s">I</a>  think this is probably a question for the administration as the question went before the administration with regards to setting up an advisory board for the Veterans Affairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5481.218s">So</a>  what you're asking is, <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5482.88s">whether</a>  or not that's something maybe the city administration would do. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5487.201s">So</a>  if we could ask our new administration if this is a possibility or if they could also look into this while they're looking into other advisory committees within the city, setting up additional advisory committees I never think is a bad thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5502.284s">And</a>  I know you spoke about a number of different issues that I think an advisory committee would probably look into, research. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5508.786s">and</a>  hopefully develop ideas and bring them to the mayor and to the board of trustees, which is a three-person board. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5514.63s">So</a>  I think it's a valid question. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5516.151s">I</a>  think it's something that may help alleviate and figure out a number of different issues that, you know, you obviously are well educated on. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5524.697s">And</a>  I don't think it's going to hurt to ask the administration what her thoughts are and to see if we can possibly implement one. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5530.641s">So</a>  I would ask the administration to look into that, see if it's a possibility, if it's something that would work. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5537.02s">We</a>  have, like I said, the three-person board, so it always helps to have a number of different people looking into different issues that have to do with the cemetery. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5544.506s">It's</a>  a large cemetery. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5545.547s">We</a>  have a number of issues there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5547.628s">I</a>  know this week I came across an issue, and I spoke to Steve Dunn at the cemetery department, and your question with regards to appeals is, yes, once a decision is made, you can appeal, but you're appealing back to the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5561.301s">So</a>  that might be something an advisory board can look into as well to maybe make some changes on that, because that almost seems like you have a three-person board that's making a decision, and your only appeals process is back to that three-member board. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5574.53s">So</a>  that could run into some questions and some issues.</p>

    <p>[mex41hYCPiQ_SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5577.291s">Conflicts.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5577.832s">Some</a>  conflicts.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5579.033s">So</a>  I did get that answer, happened to get that answer this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5583.115s">But</a>  I think it's a good resolve, and maybe our mayor can look into it.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5590.269s">Did</a>  you make a resolution, Madam Vice President?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5597.191s">No,</a>  I'm not asking for the content. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5598.391s">I'm</a>  just asking it just like we asked.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5599.851s">She</a>  can't make a resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5601.132s">Only</a>  the council can make the resolution.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5602.472s">And</a>  I'm making the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5603.612s">Can</a>  the mayor look into a possibility of an advisory commission to the cemetery?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5618.42s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5620.322s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5621.203s">I</a>  want to thank Valerie for coming up tonight on these very important issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5627.248s">I</a>  had a brief discussion with Mark Rumley in the subcommittee meeting before this regular scheduled council meeting, and he thought it was best, if Councilor Longo doesn't mind, that we send the paper directly to him regarding how an advisory committee is set up. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5643.696s">And</a>  he's prepared to answer that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5646.777s">So</a>  if we could just amend that to send it to the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5650.479s">So</a>  that would be number one, Mr. Clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5653.98s">The</a>  creation of advisory board for the cemetery. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5656.882s">Also,</a>  Valerie mentioned about the open meeting law. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5659.903s">They</a>  required to adhere to all the requirements of the state open meeting law. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5667.126s">And</a>  I'm sure Mark, city solicitor, will respond back to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5672.5s">and</a>  the appeal process. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5674.021s">I</a>  think Councilor Longo might have answered it, but maybe if we could see within the Cemetery Board of Trustees' own policy and regulations where that language exists, there may be a timeframe on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5685.525s">You</a>  might only have 10 days to appeal. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5687.246s">I'm</a>  not sure, but if we can get that appeal process language from the city solicitor, that would be helpful also, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5697.03s">Valerie</a>  was nice enough not to get into the whole issue, <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5701.425s">about</a>  a request that went before the Board of Trustees, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5705.727s">But</a>  again, it goes back to, in my opinion, you can have all the policies you want set up, but some of it has to do with what's in your heart and common sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5716.77s">And</a>  this goes back to a family that was in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5719.051s">I</a>  won't get into the whole story. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5720.571s">A</a>  family that lived in this city for 30 years, bought four plots for the husband, the wife, and I believe it was the grandparents. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5729.232s">They</a>  had a tragic situation where their son passed away as a freshman in college, and they used one of the plots to bury their son. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5738.655s">Since</a>  then, the husband passed away, the grandparents passed away, and this particular woman, who moved out of the city, although she was here for 30 years, went to the Board of Trustees and said, please, I want to be buried with my family. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5750.558s">It</a>  wasn't the way it was supposed to work out. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5752.138s">We</a>  brought four plots for us, but my son passed away, and they denied that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5757.7s">And</a>  I think some of this is just <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5759.424s">common</a>  sense, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5760.904s">But,</a>  again, you know, rules and regulations are great, but I think you have to use some common sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5767.465s">And</a>  regarding the green burial, all we need to do, from my understanding, is create a green burial policy within the Oak Grove Cemetery that would allow a portion of the cemetery to be used for green burial. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5781.248s">And</a>  it's happening now, as was mentioned, across the state and other states. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5786.149s">And</a>  it's a wave of the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5788.376s">I</a>  don't see why, you know, that wouldn't be something that at least should be entertained, and the Board of Trustees do their home, their own homework on that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5797.178s">Again,</a>  I'd like to thank Valerie for coming up on this very important subject.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5801.659s">On</a>  the motion approved by Councilor Marks, Councilor Lungo-Koehn, as amended by Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5807.24s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5808.38s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5809.601s">Motion</a>  carries. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5810.921s">On</a>  the motion of Vice President Lungo-Koehn to revert back to the regular audit business. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5814.362s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5815.502s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5817.811s">uh,</a>  16-041 to the honorable president and members of the Medford city council, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5823.774s">I</a>  respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body returned to the sale of real estate at the amount of 201,001,064 and seven cents. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5831.419s">This</a>  represents the amount received from a state grant plus the surplus not spent <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5844.117s">from</a>  the original appropriation for the Magoon Park Rehabilitation Project, a memo from the city finance directors attached, along with a copy of council paper 14-509 for your review. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5858.24s">We</a>  received this all in our packets on Friday.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5863.78s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5865.701s">Mr.</a>  President, this paper dates back to June of 2014 when Mayor McGlynn put a paper before the council asking for an appropriation. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5873.01s">of</a>  $292. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5873.691s">That</a>  appropriation was made, and once the reimbursement from the state occurs relative to the Magoon Park issues that were being taken care of, the mayor indicated that he would be requesting the transfer of the net costs to the city's sale of real estate account. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5888.382s">So</a>  it's replenishing the account, Mr. President, for which the funds were taken out of. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5892.525s">Looks</a>  like the state agreed to reimburse us <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5897.456s">$200,000</a>  on the Magoon Park improvements, and this paper represents, Mr. President, this matter coming full circle. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5904.78s">As</a>  such, I would move for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5906.442s">I</a>  believe that all the councillors here, all the councillors present at the meeting voted by way of roll call in the affirmative to appropriate the money, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5915.227s">So</a>  I think this is just bringing the matter full circle and some housekeeping. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=5919.109s">So</a>  I'd ask that the council move for approval.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6085.026s">And</a>  also, I think this should be a public meeting at 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6089.567s">in</a>  front of the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6090.688s">I</a>  think the people need to see this on TV. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6094.109s">I</a>  think the business owners deserve that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6096.209s">And</a>  I think that's what the business owners want. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6098.95s">They're</a>  crippling business. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6101.711s">And</a>  two weeks is, three weeks have gone by now where they're completely blocking business owners <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6109.412s">That's</a>  almost a month, and I'm a business owner. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6112.315s">You</a>  have to pay bills monthly, not on a day-to-day basis or once a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6117.439s">You</a>  pay bills monthly. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6118.92s">We</a>  should have this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6120.141s">We</a>  should ask them to be here next Tuesday night and cease and desist all work from being done, everything being cleared out tonight until they meet with us next Tuesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6128.969s">That's</a>  my opinion.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6133.653s">Mr.</a>  President, if it's a very difficult <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6136.623s">endeavor</a>  for the individuals that are stationed out of Boston to get to MedFed. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6140.664s">I</a>  would be happy to go to Boston and meet with them there if that's what has to take place, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6146.026s">I</a>  think we could meet there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6146.866s">I</a>  think we could also – I think Mr. Carroll would be more than willing to open up his restaurant to us to sit down there and have the meeting there if, in fact, it's ever going to happen, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6155.489s">Now,</a>  I've had my discussions with the legislative liaison from Massachusetts Highway. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6160.29s">I've</a>  gotten a number of correspondences from them because I've been added to their email list, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6166.104s">It</a>  did seem that they were unable to make it because of the short notice from the last meeting to this meeting, but that there's no reason why they can't figure out when it is that we are going to be here and we are going to put our heads together and get this done. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6176.03s">Um,</a>  some items indicated that certain phases of the construction have been complete. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6180.472s">They're</a>  about close to 30% through, um, with the portion of construction, the phase that they're in right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6185.481s">But</a>  there are a number of solutions, I think, that we can present to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6189.364s">One</a>  of them being moving all the staging equipment onto the closed-down ramp on Route 16 right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6193.708s">The</a>  ramp's closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6194.568s">Put</a>  all your junk over there so we don't have to look at it, so cars can drive up and down the street, so people can park in front of the restaurant, so people can park in front of RE-MAX. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6201.914s">You</a>  know, I think that we've made a number of suggestions, and they have been <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6208.167s">listen</a>  to, and we've been given a lot of affirmative yes, yes, yes, but there haven't been any results, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6214.995s">It's</a>  a lot of lip service at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6217.057s">So</a>  with that being said, I think it might be <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6220.34s">easier</a>  and more flexible if we as a council are more than willing to go and meet them on their turf or meet them somewhere else if they're not able to come down here to City Hall at certain hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6228.723s">I'd</a>  be happy to go to the transportation building and meet with them, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6231.304s">I'd</a>  be happy to go up to State House and- Bring your ID.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6233.645s">You</a>  have to show an ID to them.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6234.706s">I</a>  have a state ID. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6235.986s">And</a>  I'll lead at Donato's office if that's what it takes, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6239.347s">But</a>  I think that there's more than one way to skin a cat. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6243.769s">And</a>  if they're not willing to come here, maybe we have to go to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6246.6s">The</a>  other thing we can do is maybe contact the Secretariat and see if the Secretariat can help us out in putting this together. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6256.042s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I just wanted to put it out there that there are other ways that we can do this, and maybe one of them is to go to Boston and to have a small meeting with a group of appointees, maybe, to figure out when it is that we can come in there, what the issues and dispute are, what the agenda is going to be like, to create a format that we can all agree on, so when they do come here, we do have a productive session, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6276.46s">It's</a>  one thing to drag the project manager and the people from the T down here to bombard them with questions, and that's all well and good. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6282.785s">But</a>  then they get in their car and they leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6285.527s">And</a>  then nothing changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6287.309s">And</a>  I think we need to come to an accord. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6288.67s">We</a>  need to work together, and we need to form a partnership with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6291.052s">And</a>  that means that we need to be responsive to their concerns, and they need to be responsive to ours, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6295.635s">So</a>  I'll rest with that, but I appreciate you indulging me for that moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6299.479s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6301.4s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6303.142s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6305.746s">maybe</a>  a quick short-term fixes, just have the construction company adhere to the business hours that they've set at 10 o'clock or 10.30. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6314.555s">They're</a>  showing up at 8.30, 9 o'clock, parking there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6317.678s">Let</a>  the police get on there and demand that they start, or the building commissioner, or someone go down there and don't let them start work until the time they're disposed to. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6328.854s">I</a>  mean, if you're doing work in your house on a Sunday or a Saturday before 7 o'clock, the court enforcement officer is down there telling you to stop working. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6339.097s">But</a>  they weren't supposed to start working in certain areas there until after 10 o'clock, and they're starting at 9 now. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6345.899s">Again,</a>  that's not a big request from the gentleman to just start working when you're supposed to start. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6353.101s">And</a>  I say, I don't know why the police can't enforce that on our own without even going crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6360.795s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6363.157s">Councilor</a>  Falco.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6363.957s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6366.899s">I</a>  find this to be very frustrating. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6369.141s">I</a>  mean, I know I made the resolution last week to have the Committee of the Whole meeting, and here they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6375.225s">They've</a>  canceled, but we're giving them a whole week, and they still can't give us a date. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6379.648s">So</a>  this is very frustrating. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6380.768s">I</a>  mean, to me, you're impacting the livelihoods of people that own these businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6385.892s">You're</a>  impacting the residents and how they get to and from South Medford and beyond. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6391.06s">And</a>  the meeting really needs to happen sooner than later. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6394.482s">I</a>  mean, is there any way that we can have our state reps, our mayor, make a call to DOT and explain the urgency of this matter? <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6401.686s">I</a>  mean, this has to happen sooner than later. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6404.388s">It</a>  should not have to wait another week, week and a half, two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6406.849s">I</a>  mean, this, it needs to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6408.65s">This</a>  is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6410.191s">And</a>  if I may, I know myself and Mr. Scarpelli are new to this committee, would it be possible to get <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6419.284s">the</a>  original agreement between D.O.T. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6421.145s">and</a>  the city with regard to the bridge and when work was... I'm not aware of us having received a copy of it, but... Well, then can the whole committee, I guess, receive a copy? <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6430.012s">Because</a>  it would be nice to actually see something in writing as to what the rules of engagement with regard to the work that's being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6438.879s">I</a>  mean, it seems like it's kind of everyone's a little bit all over the place with regard to when it's supposed to start, when it's supposed to stop, you know, exactly what's happening down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6446.425s">So</a>  if we could get some sort of communication <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6449.2s">I'm</a>  not sure if it's the engineering department or what, but if you could get something with the agreement between the DOT and the city with regard to how everything is supposed to work with regard to the replacement of the Craddock Bridge.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6459.905s">So</a>  that is a motion by Councilor Falco offered under suspension of the rules that the city engineer or appropriate office furnish the seven members of the Medford City Council with the copy of the agreement, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6479.392s">signed</a>  regarding the construction of the Craddock Bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6485.076s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6485.717s">Thank</a>  you, council. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6487.378s">I</a>  share your frustration. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6489.199s">I've</a>  been in conversation with a member of our state delegation as well as the mayor regarding this and they share frustration as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6499.307s">And</a>  I spoke at length with the mayor about this and she's particularly discouraged at the canceling of the meeting for tomorrow night.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6510.594s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6512.976s">One</a>  of the things that we discussed several weeks ago, Mr. President, was a central depository or a central receptacle for individuals who weren't able to make the meeting, but would still like to comment on it to be able to provide an email. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6524.726s">And</a>  it's my understanding that through the works of Allison Goldberry and Mr. Rumley, this email was a setup and I believe Clerk Finn has been involved in this as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6533.858s">And</a>  I think it might be very helpful to those at home who are eagerly and anxiously awaiting the meeting to utilize this tool. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6543.023s">And</a>  with that being said, I was hoping that the city clerk could recite the email address for us if he knows it offhand. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6548.366s">I</a>  could get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6548.827s">I</a>  think I have it on my device here if you don't know it offhand. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6551.528s">It</a>  can be linked through the city website. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6553.129s">And</a>  it can also be linked to the city website. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6554.65s">Medford.org.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6555.29s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6556.271s">So</a>  the city is actually soliciting commentary right now on behalf of the council.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6559.553s">I</a>  think there was one comment already. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6561.034s">One</a>  or two. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6561.654s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6564.467s">Chair</a>  recognizes the citizen at the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6566.368s">Welcome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6567.169s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Sqp6S0Yyr0A_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6569.25s">Thank</a>  you very much, sir, and Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6572.792s">Rachel</a>  Tannenhaus, 26 Pearl Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6576.194s">Well,</a>  the first thing is that in my other life, I am, in fact, a government bureaucrat. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6581.798s">And</a>  the one good thing I can say about bureaucracy, and you don't need me to tell you this, is that everybody has a boss. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6589.342s">And</a>  eventually you get high enough up on the boss chain that the boss is like, why am I having to deal with your stuff from all the way down there? <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6600.148s">So</a>  the people at MassDOT who are cancelling have bosses and it <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6607.672s">you</a>  know, at this point, you probably already know that there's nothing wrong with, you know, going over their head and saying, hey, your employee is not actually doing their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6618.415s">Also,</a>  obviously, you know, if there are neighborhood organizations that were to, you know, say something to the press about how a city is being ignored by the state agency, <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6634.419s">And</a>  they went with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6635.879s">Obviously,</a>  nobody on the council would do such a thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6637.8s">But</a>  that is something that might also speed things up a little bit on their end is bad publicity. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6647.142s">But</a>  the thing that I would like to say in my other capacity as the chair of the Medford Disability Commission, which none of that was in, so this is my disability chair hat. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6657.884s">It's</a>  invisible. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6658.544s">It's</a>  very fetching, is that <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6663.497s">The</a>  only good thing I can say about the meeting for tomorrow night being cancelled is that those of us in the Disability Commission were very disappointed that it had been scheduled for exactly when the Disability Commission meeting was supposed to be and is going to be tomorrow night because we really wanted to be involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6679.98s">We</a>  obviously have some significant concerns about what's going on with the Craddock Bridge and we wouldn't have been able to be there because it was at exactly the same time and happened quickly enough that we weren't able to modify our agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6692.598s">for</a>  it or anything like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6693.959s">So</a>  I'd like to, I hope, even if it were the next day after that, that's fine, but I hope that when it is rescheduled that we are, I hope that it's as soon as possible, but I hope that we're also able to be there, members of the Disability Commission, because, so if it could not be during <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6712.612s">the</a>  Disability Commission meeting, that would be really fantastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6715.794s">I</a>  doubt it will be because the next one after tomorrow is in a month, and I think at that point everybody's head will have exploded if they have to wait that long, but we would really like to be involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6727.523s">And</a>  so we obviously would love it if it could happen at a time that was not when we were otherwise meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6735.79s">Thank</a>  you so much.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6736.51s">Thank</a>  you, Rachel. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6737.531s">On</a>  the motion for approval by <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6739.147s">Councilor</a>  Falco on his motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6742.448s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6744.869s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6746.23s">Motion</a>  carries. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6748.651s">Records</a>  of meeting of January 19th, 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6754.093s">We're</a>  past it, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6755.614s">Mr.</a>  Councilor, how'd you find those records? <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6759.175s">In</a>  order and move for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6760.316s">On</a>  the motion for approval, the records of that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6762.397s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6767.059s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6769.076s">Motion</a>  records have passed and accepted on the motion for adjournment by councillor Falco all those in favor all those opposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/bYPNp9Y4BQU&t=6776.954s">Thank</a>  you all</p>
