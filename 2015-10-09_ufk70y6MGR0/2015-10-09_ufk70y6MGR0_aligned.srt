1
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,462
I'm Jocelyn McCarthy and I'm here with the Mustang Report.

2
00:00:08,802 --> 00:00:11,724
I'm here with Bobby Maloney, who is the Athletic Director at Meffitt High School.

3
00:00:12,184 --> 00:00:14,846
What are some of the challenges as an Athletic Director?

4
00:00:15,286 --> 00:00:17,068
Regular challenges every year are the budget.

5
00:00:17,608 --> 00:00:22,311
We're very fortunate that we have a superintendent, a mayor, and a school committee that supports athletics in our city.

6
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:27,394
Inclement weather, challenging for fall sports and spring sports.

7
00:00:27,734 --> 00:00:34,319
We're very fortunate at Meffitt, we have some nice facilities and we have some nice turf fields, so we very rarely cancel anything.

8
00:00:35,259 --> 00:00:39,204
Bottom line is we want our student-athletes to have a positive experience up here.

9
00:00:39,885 --> 00:00:46,432
Very few people go professional, even go on to college and play, so we want our kids to have a great experience up here.

10
00:00:47,449 --> 00:00:49,150
What is the process of hiring a new coach?

11
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:54,073
We accept interviews, we post it, we look for teachers first.

12
00:00:54,733 --> 00:00:59,576
It's nice to have a teacher in the building because they understand that it's an extension of the classroom.

13
00:01:00,697 --> 00:01:04,179
It's nice to have a Medford person involved, somebody who's come through the system.

14
00:01:04,759 --> 00:01:07,921
We've been very fortunate recently to hire some Medford coaches.

15
00:01:08,961 --> 00:01:10,422
John Skerry is a Medford kid.

16
00:01:10,462 --> 00:01:13,203
He just took over for boys basketball.

17
00:01:13,223 --> 00:01:14,423
He went to Tufts University.

18
00:01:15,104 --> 00:01:18,625
Rayanne Forbes is taking over for Dave McCarthy, who's decided to retire.

19
00:01:19,425 --> 00:01:24,207
She's a Medford kid who went to Northeastern University, so we're very fortunate to have some great Medford coaches here.

20
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:29,649
Hi, I'm Lydia Ryan with the Mustang Report, and we're here in the Medford High School gym with John Skerry.

21
00:01:29,669 --> 00:01:30,730
Hi, Mr. Skerry.

22
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:31,510
How are you doing today?

23
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:32,210
I'm great.

24
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:32,611
How are you?

25
00:01:32,891 --> 00:01:33,291
I'm good.

26
00:01:33,871 --> 00:01:36,052
So, Mr. Skerry, what is your role in Medford High School?

27
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:46,149
Well, I'm the new Boys Varsity basketball coach, and I'm also a member of the instructional support staff here at Medford High, and I'm also working towards my full teacher certification.

28
00:01:46,169 --> 00:01:48,631
That's awesome, I hope you get it.

29
00:01:49,352 --> 00:01:52,695
So, can you give us a background on your basketball play-in days?

30
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:55,651
Sure, well I'm born and raised in Medford.

31
00:01:55,831 --> 00:02:00,413
I grew up playing in this gym back in the MCE program back in the, I think the 80s.

32
00:02:02,193 --> 00:02:05,254
My high school playing days were at Malden Catholic and then I played at Tufts.

33
00:02:05,815 --> 00:02:10,656
I was captain of the varsity basketball team at Tufts and since then I've coached at Tufts.

34
00:02:10,716 --> 00:02:13,017
Also I coached at Suffolk University.

35
00:02:13,557 --> 00:02:18,259
Last year I was the assistant coach at Minuteman High School where we advanced to the Division III North quarterfinals.

36
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,820
That's awesome.

37
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,561
What are your goals for this year?

38
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:25,319
Well right now I'm just getting to know the kids.

39
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:30,501
I see them in the hallway every day and I'm looking to build a program and that starts from the beginning.

40
00:02:31,561 --> 00:02:38,285
We have actually started, well we're continuing what's known as the Medford Fall Ball program which is a program for grades one through eight.

41
00:02:38,785 --> 00:02:47,109
We primarily have mostly first graders through sixth graders and that meets every Saturday and it's still open to the public so come on down and sign up if you haven't already and that's instructional.

42
00:02:48,309 --> 00:02:49,410
We're starting with basics.

43
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:50,971
We don't get right into games right away.

44
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:54,053
For the younger kids, we use a smaller basket and a smaller ball.

45
00:02:54,113 --> 00:02:59,596
So I want to try to build a program that involves kids who are years away from being in high school.

46
00:02:59,997 --> 00:03:04,680
In terms of for the kids that are here, it's school first.

47
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,821
I want to make sure that they get their grades in order.

48
00:03:07,301 --> 00:03:08,562
And then basketball comes second.

49
00:03:08,642 --> 00:03:13,065
I tell all the kids that I see in the hall every day, family first, then school, then basketball.

50
00:03:13,185 --> 00:03:14,326
And that's something that we try to live by.

51
00:03:15,453 --> 00:03:16,494
That's a great way to live.

52
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:20,880
Describe your off-season program and any programs specialized for the youth of Medford.

53
00:03:21,812 --> 00:03:26,653
Well, in terms of, like I just mentioned, the fall ball program for the younger kids, grades one through eight.

54
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:32,375
For anyone who's in the high school now that's thinking about trying out, the first thing I would say is get in shape.

55
00:03:32,935 --> 00:03:34,735
If you think you're in shape, you're probably not.

56
00:03:35,255 --> 00:03:37,876
And if you know you're out of shape, you've got an uphill climb.

57
00:03:38,896 --> 00:03:44,238
In Massachusetts, tryouts don't start until the Monday after Thanksgiving, so you've got some time.

58
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:49,739
But until then, it's just a matter of working on your own game, on your own time, and really getting your class stuff in order.

59
00:03:51,768 --> 00:03:54,010
So what is your philosophy on discipline?

60
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,012
Gotta have discipline.

61
00:03:56,432 --> 00:04:00,115
I don't have a lot of rules, but my main rule is to be on time.

62
00:04:00,676 --> 00:04:04,659
If you're late, you're not ready, you're distracting your teammates, you're distracting your classmates.

63
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,041
So just building good habits.

64
00:04:07,221 --> 00:04:17,570
Like I said before, I don't have a hundred different rules, but be a good teammate, be a good student, be a good son, be a good brother, and just don't be late.

65
00:04:20,257 --> 00:04:22,740
How do you handle the tryout and cut process?

66
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,903
Well, we'll have, like I said, tryouts start the Monday after Thanksgiving.

67
00:04:27,764 --> 00:04:30,747
How many spots we're going to have per team, we'll see roughly 15, 16, 17.

68
00:04:32,869 --> 00:04:36,712
We'll have a freshman team, and then a junior varsity team, and then the varsity team.

69
00:04:36,752 --> 00:04:38,834
And that'll all start the Monday after Thanksgiving.

70
00:04:38,954 --> 00:04:43,238
So if you're a freshman that's good enough to play varsity, I'll put you on the varsity.

71
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:45,680
If you're a junior or senior, you know,

72
00:04:48,008 --> 00:04:49,029
The spots are open to anybody.

73
00:04:49,049 --> 00:04:51,811
I'm brand new this year, so everyone has a clean slate.

74
00:04:51,851 --> 00:04:54,274
If you've tried out before and you haven't had success, come on back.

75
00:04:54,334 --> 00:04:57,416
And just because you were on the team in the past doesn't guarantee anything with me.

76
00:04:59,018 --> 00:04:59,398
Awesome.

77
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:04,783
So what would you try to teach your players besides basketball, and how would you handle that?

78
00:05:05,674 --> 00:05:10,435
Well, from my own personal and professional experience, you know, basketball is a great teacher in life.

79
00:05:11,075 --> 00:05:15,917
So, you know, if I'm only teaching my players basketball, I'm not doing a very good job.

80
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:22,018
At this level, it's my job and my staff's job to ideally get my players ready for college.

81
00:05:22,338 --> 00:05:24,279
Whether or not basketball is in their future,

82
00:05:25,059 --> 00:05:26,320
I need to get them ready for college.

83
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,981
If they don't want to go to college, I have to help them get ready for the workforce.

84
00:05:29,501 --> 00:05:45,048
So basketball, you know, stuff that you do in the court, you know, being on time, following rules, those are all skills, life skills, that can transfer into the next phase of life, whether, like I said, whether it's college or the workforce or the military or taking a gap year or anything like that.

85
00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:48,370
So basketball can help prepare you for all of those things.

86
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:50,791
Awesome.

87
00:05:50,811 --> 00:05:52,412
How has coaching affected your life?

88
00:05:53,285 --> 00:05:55,106
It's been great.

89
00:05:55,566 --> 00:05:59,047
All experiences that I've had in life, I can directly attribute to basketball.

90
00:05:59,627 --> 00:06:06,770
When I was at Tufts, I had an opportunity to go back to graduate school because of basketball, so I got my master's in education.

91
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:11,332
All connections that I've made in life, although obviously I didn't go to the NBA, but

92
00:06:12,012 --> 00:06:15,115
My best friends are people that I've played with and I've coached with.

93
00:06:15,555 --> 00:06:23,821
So basketball is always the connections that you'll make now and the contacts that you make now, whether they be at the high school level or the college level, they will follow you for the rest of your life.

94
00:06:26,563 --> 00:06:29,866
What would you say to incoming freshmen who are trying out for the team?

95
00:06:30,386 --> 00:06:31,187
I'd say come on out.

96
00:06:31,848 --> 00:06:33,669
And I'd say make sure you're in shape.

97
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:38,253
I can't give you a number of how many kids that we're going to keep, but

98
00:06:39,384 --> 00:06:42,626
Practice, work on your game now, work on your ball handling now.

99
00:06:43,167 --> 00:06:45,949
You know, you can be doing 100 push-ups and 100 sit-ups every day.

100
00:06:46,129 --> 00:06:47,209
Get your body in shape.

101
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,251
And just come try out.

102
00:06:49,651 --> 00:06:53,354
I'm gonna try to keep as many freshmen as we possibly can, because I don't want to turn anybody away.

103
00:06:54,995 --> 00:06:55,895
Thank you, Mr. Skerry.

104
00:06:55,955 --> 00:06:58,117
And I'm Lydia Ryan, signing off.

105
00:06:58,237 --> 00:06:58,777
Back to you.

106
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:02,340
I'm here with Mr. Glusi, the phys ed teacher.

107
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,042
What are some of the challenges as a phys ed teacher?

108
00:07:05,955 --> 00:07:10,418
Some of the big challenges as phys ed teachers, we only see the kids two times every six days.

109
00:07:11,019 --> 00:07:16,002
So we're definitely making strides as far as, you know, a freshman, sophomore, phys ed, it's really fitness based.

110
00:07:16,022 --> 00:07:20,966
So we're trying to pass on good fitness habits and having them, like, learn how to take care of themselves.

111
00:07:21,526 --> 00:07:22,687
I would love to see them every day.

112
00:07:23,007 --> 00:07:29,371
So it's kind of tough, you know, because the way our schedule is, you throw a holiday or something in there, you may not see a kid for a full week.

113
00:07:30,592 --> 00:07:32,734
What are some of the responsibilities as a phys ed teacher?

114
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:35,362
We have a lot of responsibilities.

115
00:07:35,402 --> 00:07:39,583
We're in charge of the health habits for pretty much every kid in this school.

116
00:07:39,603 --> 00:07:41,404
You know, we see every student, which is great.

117
00:07:42,264 --> 00:07:43,144
I love the way we do it.

118
00:07:43,164 --> 00:07:45,845
Freshmen and sophomores start the year, juniors and seniors end the year.

119
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:47,706
But we have a lot of responsibilities.

120
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:54,489
As I said, you know, passing on healthy health habits and just making sure these kids know what they're doing, preparing them for life.

121
00:07:54,969 --> 00:08:00,451
We're trying to get them in the best shape possible, you know, so their future, so there's no health problems.

122
00:08:00,955 --> 00:08:03,017
Do you have different curriculums for different grades?

123
00:08:03,437 --> 00:08:03,737
We do.

124
00:08:04,138 --> 00:08:06,940
Freshman physical education is called introduction to fitness.

125
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,021
There's a lot of strength testing.

126
00:08:09,081 --> 00:08:10,102
We do time mile.

127
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:13,365
We do the pacer test, push-up test, sit-up test, pull-up test.

128
00:08:13,885 --> 00:08:16,107
Sophomore phys ed is a little more comprehensive.

129
00:08:16,187 --> 00:08:20,691
It's called components of fitness, foundations of fitness, excuse me.

130
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,132
Students are required to keep a binder.

131
00:08:22,272 --> 00:08:27,396
We used to do an actual paper binder, but this year we're trying to do digital downloads of all our documents.

132
00:08:27,938 --> 00:08:31,302
There's more anatomy, there's more body systems, it's way more in-depth.

133
00:09:13,294 --> 00:09:16,316
Hi, I'm Amber Harbison and I'm here at the science fair and I'm here with Leila.

134
00:09:29,579 --> 00:09:30,620
And what's your project?

135
00:09:31,441 --> 00:09:39,390
It's basically a way that we want to try and target a specific pathway involved in disease, and we do that with the molecules that we make.

136
00:09:40,591 --> 00:09:46,537
I think it's a very cool project because we really get to see a lot of different aspects of science.

137
00:09:46,598 --> 00:09:47,599
It's not just, you know,

138
00:09:48,565 --> 00:09:49,245
chemistry.

139
00:09:49,325 --> 00:09:52,206
It's very much an overlap of many different fields.

140
00:09:52,266 --> 00:09:58,707
We do a lot of kind of, you know, biotech engineering, a lot of synthesis, a lot of assays.

141
00:09:58,767 --> 00:10:01,948
And so it's great to see, like, you know, all fields come together.

142
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:03,548
So it's fun.

143
00:10:03,568 --> 00:10:06,789
I'm Victoria Rashti here at the Reverse Science Fair, and I'm here with Mr. Wilson.

144
00:10:06,829 --> 00:10:07,929
How are you today, Mr. Wilson?

145
00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:08,529
Excellent.

146
00:10:08,549 --> 00:10:08,849
How are you?

147
00:10:09,089 --> 00:10:09,689
I'm great, thanks.

148
00:10:09,989 --> 00:10:13,170
So why did you decide to take your class to the Reverse Science Fair today?

149
00:10:13,925 --> 00:10:16,886
I wanted them to get a chance to see what science really looks like.

150
00:10:17,307 --> 00:10:20,508
So all of these guys are actually in the middle of conducting research.

151
00:10:21,008 --> 00:10:23,970
Some of it could theoretically change the world.

152
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:25,690
And some of this stuff is really cool.

153
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:28,992
And get an opportunity to kind of look and see what that is like.

154
00:10:29,292 --> 00:10:36,975
And maybe inspire some of them to go beyond their just studying of biology or chemistry, but trying to think about how to apply it.

155
00:10:37,856 --> 00:10:39,396
And this is a wonderful example of that.

156
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:42,618
What's one of the experiments that's your favorite here today?

157
00:10:43,187 --> 00:10:46,590
I've only seen a couple of them so far, but there's a couple that are really cool.

158
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:56,398
There's over in one spot, there's a gentleman who is working to potentially mutate bacteria to produce an enzyme that people are actually missing in their body.

159
00:10:56,438 --> 00:10:58,620
So he talks about like lactose intolerance.

160
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,042
People are lactose intolerant and missing an enzyme called lactase.

161
00:11:01,642 --> 00:11:03,724
He's looking at one that's similar to that.

162
00:11:04,304 --> 00:11:11,228
And with that, they would actually never have to, if they can get it to work, never have to take a pill to be able to do that.

163
00:11:12,128 --> 00:11:18,272
And in the particular case he's talking about, it's more severe in its side effects than lactose intolerance with the stomach upset and things like that.

164
00:11:18,292 --> 00:11:21,193
It actually can cause developmental brain disorders and so forth.

165
00:11:21,233 --> 00:11:23,354
So it could change people's lives.

166
00:11:23,574 --> 00:11:25,195
And that's one that was really interesting.

167
00:11:25,215 --> 00:11:33,700
There's another gentleman that's working on looking at ways to help with the antibiotic-resistant bacteria problem that's spreading.

168
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,600
So some really interesting stuff.

169
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,001
Like I said, I've only made it about halfway around, so I'm looking forward to the rest.

170
00:11:39,441 --> 00:11:42,942
So are any of these experiments similar to what you would have done in grad school?

171
00:11:43,442 --> 00:11:49,743
No, for me, I was not involved in running experiments over at Tufts.

172
00:11:49,763 --> 00:11:57,204
I was a biochem major for a while, then a bio major, but I was never part of the lab experience that these guys are doing.

173
00:11:57,224 --> 00:12:02,305
This is a whole other level of what you get the chance to do if you take advantage at a college.

174
00:12:02,942 --> 00:12:03,702
That's great, Mr. Wilson.

175
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:04,363
Thank you so much.

176
00:12:04,443 --> 00:12:06,504
Have a great time at the River Science Fair.

177
00:12:06,524 --> 00:12:06,924
All right.

178
00:12:06,984 --> 00:12:10,106
Thank you, you too.

179
00:12:10,126 --> 00:12:10,786
Did you see that?

180
00:12:11,346 --> 00:12:11,747
See what?

181
00:12:11,767 --> 00:12:12,627
A matter baby.

182
00:12:13,568 --> 00:12:14,288
What's a matter baby?

183
00:12:14,308 --> 00:12:15,128
Yeah, not much.

184
00:12:15,148 --> 00:12:15,849
What's the matter with you?

185
00:12:17,049 --> 00:12:17,750
Nothing at all.
