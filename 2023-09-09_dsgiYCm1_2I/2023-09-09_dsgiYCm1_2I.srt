1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:05,474
[SPEAKER_08]: Vijaya Sundaram is a native of northern India who has been a resident.

2
00:00:05,655 --> 00:00:06,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Southern India.

3
00:00:06,375 --> 00:00:07,116
[SPEAKER_08]: Southern India.

4
00:00:07,536 --> 00:00:07,957
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

5
00:00:08,037 --> 00:00:10,779
[SPEAKER_08]: I just knew I couldn't go the whole night without blowing something.

6
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:11,800
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, very good.

7
00:00:12,181 --> 00:00:15,925
[SPEAKER_08]: Southern India, who has been a resident of Medford for a number of years.

8
00:00:16,645 --> 00:00:21,850
[SPEAKER_08]: She lives in Medford's other west, that is Felsway West.

9
00:00:22,391 --> 00:00:24,173
[SPEAKER_08]: She is a truly creative spirit.

10
00:00:24,713 --> 00:00:30,138
[SPEAKER_08]: Vijay is an accomplished poet and what I call a literary lioness.

11
00:00:30,878 --> 00:00:41,227
[SPEAKER_08]: She is also a songwriter, a singer, and an adjunct professor, no, an assistant professor in the English and Humanities Department at Bunker Hill Community College.

12
00:00:41,788 --> 00:00:49,034
[SPEAKER_08]: She has been a traditional classroom and homeschooling elementary grades teacher, as well as a poetry and literature professor.

13
00:00:49,634 --> 00:00:55,378
[SPEAKER_08]: Her written work has appeared in publications like the Rising Phoenix Press and the Stardust Review.

14
00:00:55,919 --> 00:01:13,171
[SPEAKER_08]: And just a few weeks ago, her first full collection of poetry called Fractured Lens, very good, was released by Somerville-Sylvania Barber Press.

15
00:01:14,284 --> 00:01:17,406
[SPEAKER_08]: I have known Vijaya for a little over two years now.

16
00:01:17,826 --> 00:01:24,089
[SPEAKER_08]: We've worked together on a few occasions, and I've been blessed by our association and allyship.

17
00:01:24,929 --> 00:01:27,790
[SPEAKER_08]: She is a poet of great power and clarity.

18
00:01:28,331 --> 00:01:31,452
[SPEAKER_08]: There is substance, style, and depth to her writing.

19
00:01:31,952 --> 00:01:42,257
[SPEAKER_08]: She is a progressive thinker and understands social injustice, prejudice, and systemic inequity from both a personal and intellectual perspective.

20
00:01:42,918 --> 00:01:45,561
[SPEAKER_08]: In many ways, we are kindred spirits.

21
00:01:46,202 --> 00:01:55,173
[SPEAKER_08]: It's my honor and my pleasure to bring my good friend and poetry peer Vijaya Sundaram to First Fridays at the West Medford Community Center.

22
00:01:55,493 --> 00:01:56,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much, Terry.

23
00:01:56,875 --> 00:01:57,296
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

24
00:01:57,456 --> 00:01:57,957
[SPEAKER_08]: You're welcome.

25
00:01:57,977 --> 00:01:58,397
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

26
00:01:58,497 --> 00:01:58,998
[SPEAKER_08]: You're welcome.

27
00:02:01,058 --> 00:02:07,323
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to let you run in just a second, because I'm only going to get this one more time.

28
00:02:07,843 --> 00:02:18,530
[SPEAKER_08]: So as I participated in your recent inauguration, I had the opportunity to present a new poem extending words of welcome and speaking to the transition.

29
00:02:19,071 --> 00:02:23,774
[SPEAKER_08]: So as is my custom in hosting these evenings, I'd like to share a piece of verse.

30
00:02:24,234 --> 00:02:28,097
[SPEAKER_08]: And this was that poem, and it's called The Refreshing.

31
00:02:31,388 --> 00:02:43,053
[SPEAKER_08]: We keep it fresh, my friends, not because the first thing wasn't a good thing, a timely thing, an honorable thing, even a historic thing, but because the next thing matters too.

32
00:02:43,713 --> 00:02:44,974
[SPEAKER_08]: It extends equity.

33
00:02:45,434 --> 00:02:47,175
[SPEAKER_08]: It doubles down on diversity.

34
00:02:47,595 --> 00:02:49,256
[SPEAKER_08]: It infests in inclusion.

35
00:02:49,356 --> 00:02:53,998
[SPEAKER_08]: It creates a rising tide that lifts our mystic ships yet again.

36
00:02:54,998 --> 00:03:00,700
[SPEAKER_08]: Our new embrace is warm and substantial, even as our goodbye is sober and heartfelt.

37
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,201
[SPEAKER_08]: We haven't lost.

38
00:03:02,701 --> 00:03:03,381
[SPEAKER_08]: We've learned.

39
00:03:03,941 --> 00:03:09,263
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is ripe fruit for renewal and restoration and revolution.

40
00:03:10,143 --> 00:03:19,527
[SPEAKER_08]: Inaugurations and installations are both splendid invitations for a good thing, a timely thing, an honorable thing, even a historic thing.

41
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:22,929
[SPEAKER_08]: So have no lamentations in this place.

42
00:03:23,589 --> 00:03:26,091
[SPEAKER_08]: Our task is both noble and necessary.

43
00:03:26,671 --> 00:03:28,492
[SPEAKER_08]: We rejoice in what we came to do.

44
00:03:28,993 --> 00:03:31,014
[SPEAKER_08]: We resound in what we came to do.

45
00:03:31,634 --> 00:03:34,016
[SPEAKER_08]: We refresh in what we came to do.

46
00:03:34,736 --> 00:03:36,578
[SPEAKER_08]: We release in what we came to do.

47
00:03:37,797 --> 00:03:43,320
[SPEAKER_08]: If one holds the torch too long, the oil of his anointing will burn close and at caution.

48
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:48,402
[SPEAKER_08]: Wisdom reproaches and advises, do not let darkness beckon.

49
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:51,303
[SPEAKER_08]: Light a new candle and pass it on.

50
00:03:52,104 --> 00:03:55,245
[SPEAKER_08]: The centurion awaits her in ordination.

51
00:03:55,785 --> 00:03:57,866
[SPEAKER_08]: The sentinel watches at the ramparts.

52
00:03:57,906 --> 00:04:00,187
[SPEAKER_08]: The vanguard prepares to approach.

53
00:04:00,267 --> 00:04:02,949
[SPEAKER_08]: The next herald must have her say.

54
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:07,591
[SPEAKER_08]: The same sun shines equally on antiquity and perpetuity.

55
00:04:08,312 --> 00:04:14,675
[SPEAKER_08]: Let the old inform the new, even as the midnight sky informs the morning dew at the break of dawn.

56
00:04:15,335 --> 00:04:19,218
[SPEAKER_08]: Let what was become what is and is to come.

57
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:30,883
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's keep it fresh, my friends, because while the first thing was a good thing, a timely thing, an honorable thing, even a historic thing, the next thing matters too.

58
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:33,464
[SPEAKER_08]: Let it extend equity.

59
00:04:33,984 --> 00:04:35,825
[SPEAKER_08]: Let it double down on diversity.

60
00:04:36,385 --> 00:04:38,326
[SPEAKER_08]: Let it invest in inclusion.

61
00:04:38,726 --> 00:04:45,769
[SPEAKER_08]: Let it create a rising tide that lifts our ancient ships yet again for Vijaya.

62
00:04:46,934 --> 00:04:47,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.

63
00:04:47,935 --> 00:04:49,075
[SPEAKER_02]: What a beautiful poem.

64
00:04:49,095 --> 00:04:50,136
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to have to clap.

65
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:52,537
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

66
00:04:54,137 --> 00:04:54,618
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

67
00:04:54,678 --> 00:04:55,438
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much.

68
00:04:55,718 --> 00:04:57,159
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's the lay of the land.

69
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:03,722
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's have a friendly chat with my old friend and your new friend Vijaya Sundaram.

70
00:05:05,403 --> 00:05:11,646
[SPEAKER_08]: So Vijaya, can you talk a bit about your early journey to the US as an immigrant from India?

71
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:14,467
[SPEAKER_08]: What brought you here and why did you stay?

72
00:05:15,689 --> 00:05:24,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, that would lead me to include my husband, Warren, who very kindly showed up and gave me my glasses when I needed them.

73
00:05:24,052 --> 00:05:25,513
[SPEAKER_02]: I completely forgot I needed them.

74
00:05:25,893 --> 00:05:26,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

75
00:05:26,934 --> 00:05:27,934
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to signal to him.

76
00:05:28,374 --> 00:05:32,596
[SPEAKER_02]: So I met Warren in 1986 in the city of Pune.

77
00:05:32,816 --> 00:05:36,377
[SPEAKER_02]: I had just arrived in Pune in 1985 from the south of India.

78
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:38,158
[SPEAKER_02]: He had just arrived in 1985 from Boston.

79
00:05:40,499 --> 00:05:42,620
[SPEAKER_02]: on a scholarship to study Indian classical music.

80
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:49,682
[SPEAKER_02]: I was at Ferguson College studying my masters in literature, and he was there hosting musicians in his house.

81
00:05:50,562 --> 00:05:55,364
[SPEAKER_02]: So through a series of interesting events, I ended up at his place, not knowing it was his place.

82
00:05:56,344 --> 00:05:57,424
[SPEAKER_02]: We met each other.

83
00:05:57,464 --> 00:05:59,785
[SPEAKER_02]: We became instant friends.

84
00:06:00,385 --> 00:06:00,906
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked.

85
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:01,666
[SPEAKER_02]: We played music.

86
00:06:01,706 --> 00:06:02,186
[SPEAKER_02]: We sang.

87
00:06:02,466 --> 00:06:04,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Two years later, we got married, and I came here.

88
00:06:05,507 --> 00:06:05,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

89
00:06:06,308 --> 00:06:06,868
[SPEAKER_02]: That was it.

90
00:06:07,728 --> 00:06:14,712
[SPEAKER_02]: We thought that we'd be here for a short while, but his father said, nope, we're going to arrange for a green card for you.

91
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:15,993
[SPEAKER_02]: So he did.

92
00:06:16,453 --> 00:06:18,614
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought, OK, brief while.

93
00:06:18,714 --> 00:06:20,675
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the time flew by.

94
00:06:20,735 --> 00:06:21,916
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I said, OK, fine.

95
00:06:21,956 --> 00:06:23,297
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like I'm going to live here.

96
00:06:24,177 --> 00:06:26,318
[SPEAKER_02]: So I became a citizen in 1999.

97
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:36,303
[SPEAKER_02]: What brought me here is really getting married to Warren Sanders, a musician and a band leader and writer and educator himself.

98
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:36,924
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

99
00:06:37,184 --> 00:06:37,964
[SPEAKER_08]: Fantastic.

100
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:39,125
[SPEAKER_08]: Fantastic.

101
00:06:39,225 --> 00:06:43,047
[SPEAKER_08]: And clearly, the same thing that brought you here is the thing that keeps you here.

102
00:06:43,067 --> 00:06:44,167
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, indeed.

103
00:06:44,207 --> 00:06:44,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Really good.

104
00:06:45,448 --> 00:06:46,028
[SPEAKER_08]: Really good.

105
00:06:49,637 --> 00:06:59,501
[SPEAKER_08]: differences, whether it's cultural, sociological, environmental, between where you were and where you are.

106
00:07:00,742 --> 00:07:11,287
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I was in the city of Madras, which is now Chennai, and Pune, which is now Pune, things obviously weren't as automated as they are now.

107
00:07:12,387 --> 00:07:16,489
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the differences there were that people would

108
00:07:18,635 --> 00:07:20,055
[SPEAKER_02]: The body language is different.

109
00:07:20,196 --> 00:07:21,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Facial expressions are different.

110
00:07:22,076 --> 00:07:23,997
[SPEAKER_02]: You speak English, but it's not the same.

111
00:07:24,837 --> 00:07:27,498
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that we spoke a different grammar.

112
00:07:27,658 --> 00:07:29,999
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that we spoke a different culture of English.

113
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:34,560
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to explain until you've lived in two places for any length of time.

114
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,082
[SPEAKER_02]: If you just go and visit, it's not the same thing.

115
00:07:38,142 --> 00:07:39,622
[SPEAKER_02]: People will make allowances for you.

116
00:07:39,982 --> 00:07:41,703
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you live there and then you live here,

117
00:07:42,563 --> 00:07:48,451
[SPEAKER_02]: you learn that your facial expression and your body language change imperceptibly.

118
00:07:49,232 --> 00:07:51,014
[SPEAKER_02]: The way you walk, the way you carry yourself.

119
00:07:51,435 --> 00:07:58,103
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the city of Pune, men didn't look at women directly unless you were equals in college or something like that.

120
00:07:58,163 --> 00:07:58,904
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd sort of look.

121
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:04,329
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of respectfully sideways, maybe not directly.

122
00:08:04,909 --> 00:08:06,150
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one of the differences.

123
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:13,235
[SPEAKER_02]: So I remembered feeling annoyed when I went back and people didn't look at me directly because I'd gotten used to it over here.

124
00:08:13,435 --> 00:08:19,060
[SPEAKER_02]: So another thing that I had gotten used to, well there's so much.

125
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,702
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember when I spoke over here and

126
00:08:24,243 --> 00:08:26,024
[SPEAKER_02]: gestured, people didn't understand me.

127
00:08:26,565 --> 00:08:28,706
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought, surely I'm making sense.

128
00:08:28,826 --> 00:08:32,748
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm speaking grammatical English, and I speak and enunciate clearly.

129
00:08:33,068 --> 00:08:34,349
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is it that they're missing?

130
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:35,790
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it that I'm missing?

131
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:43,315
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think they were primed to misunderstand me, and I was primed to not understand that they didn't understand me.

132
00:08:43,595 --> 00:08:44,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know what I mean?

133
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:45,716
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I do.

134
00:08:46,236 --> 00:08:48,498
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really hard to explain, but I remember

135
00:08:49,718 --> 00:08:53,161
[SPEAKER_02]: thinking I was very clear and someone misunderstood what I was saying.

136
00:08:53,901 --> 00:09:01,726
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is, it's almost like when they hear your name, for example, you write your name, Vijaya, they imagine that it's something else.

137
00:09:02,347 --> 00:09:03,888
[SPEAKER_02]: It's exactly as it's written.

138
00:09:05,229 --> 00:09:14,155
[SPEAKER_02]: But because mentally you're thinking it's a foreign thing, you are sort of not noticing what it really is.

139
00:09:14,915 --> 00:09:16,556
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, it's very imperceptible.

140
00:09:16,676 --> 00:09:18,538
[SPEAKER_02]: When I went back to Pune the first time,

141
00:09:19,598 --> 00:09:21,501
[SPEAKER_02]: All the shopkeepers said, where are you from?

142
00:09:21,521 --> 00:09:23,143
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, I'm from here.

143
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:25,666
[SPEAKER_02]: They said, no, you're not from here.

144
00:09:25,786 --> 00:09:26,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are you from?

145
00:09:26,908 --> 00:09:28,971
[SPEAKER_02]: So both ways, everything changes.

146
00:09:29,191 --> 00:09:31,734
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's impossible to put it into words.

147
00:09:32,315 --> 00:09:35,960
[SPEAKER_02]: All I know is you stand differently if you're in America.

148
00:09:36,941 --> 00:09:38,963
[SPEAKER_02]: You talk differently, you are more direct.

149
00:09:39,723 --> 00:09:44,208
[SPEAKER_02]: In India, they are direct, they are very direct, but it's different eye contact.

150
00:09:46,951 --> 00:09:51,875
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just one of the things, and then of course everything else is too big a thing to go into.

151
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:55,019
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a cultural thing, it's a different talk entirely.

152
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:56,540
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you miss?

153
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,102
[SPEAKER_08]: What kinds of things do you miss?

154
00:10:00,937 --> 00:10:02,719
[SPEAKER_02]: In India, people show up unannounced.

155
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:05,401
[SPEAKER_02]: So the doorbell rings and it's your friend.

156
00:10:05,901 --> 00:10:06,522
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a neighbor.

157
00:10:07,282 --> 00:10:08,684
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're not supposed to get annoyed.

158
00:10:09,404 --> 00:10:10,185
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got annoyed.

159
00:10:10,285 --> 00:10:13,768
[SPEAKER_02]: After I'd lived here for a while, I went back and said, why don't you call me?

160
00:10:13,788 --> 00:10:14,488
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not ready.

161
00:10:14,669 --> 00:10:15,409
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not dressed.

162
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:15,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Forget it.

163
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:19,212
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very sweet.

164
00:10:19,272 --> 00:10:21,193
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the nice aspects of India.

165
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:22,114
[SPEAKER_02]: People come.

166
00:10:22,134 --> 00:10:25,976
[SPEAKER_02]: There's fluid movement between homes and houses.

167
00:10:26,757 --> 00:10:30,860
[SPEAKER_02]: People show up, and they're there for you in a way.

168
00:10:32,392 --> 00:10:33,914
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that obvious here.

169
00:10:33,974 --> 00:10:37,117
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying they're not here for you, but it's too far-flung.

170
00:10:37,518 --> 00:10:39,420
[SPEAKER_02]: The communities are too disparate.

171
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,464
[SPEAKER_02]: But in India, my mother and my aunt live alone now in a flat.

172
00:10:44,045 --> 00:10:46,287
[SPEAKER_02]: My grandmother died, my father died, my grandfather died.

173
00:10:46,587 --> 00:10:48,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Two older women living alone.

174
00:10:49,671 --> 00:10:51,552
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're very brave.

175
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:55,073
[SPEAKER_02]: In India, it's always the man who protects you.

176
00:10:55,553 --> 00:10:57,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Over here, too, actually, but people deny it.

177
00:10:58,894 --> 00:11:01,275
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about the mindset.

178
00:11:02,096 --> 00:11:03,696
[SPEAKER_02]: But here, it's much more independent.

179
00:11:04,977 --> 00:11:07,578
[SPEAKER_02]: There, the women are becoming more independent.

180
00:11:08,738 --> 00:11:12,539
[SPEAKER_02]: I miss the coming and going of people over there.

181
00:11:12,619 --> 00:11:14,180
[SPEAKER_02]: I miss the crowds on the street.

182
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:18,521
[SPEAKER_02]: I could ride my bicycle late at night and never be afraid.

183
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:27,844
[SPEAKER_02]: I would ride from Deccan Gymkhana, where I would have done a recording for the Indian Institute, the Film Institute of India, with Warren.

184
00:11:28,344 --> 00:11:28,965
[SPEAKER_02]: He was staying there.

185
00:11:29,045 --> 00:11:31,866
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'd ride my bike home, and it would be midnight.

186
00:11:33,346 --> 00:11:42,716
[SPEAKER_02]: And people would be going, not just men, but men and women and children going for a midnight snack for the local restaurant or something.

187
00:11:42,736 --> 00:11:45,078
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really charming, so I miss that.

188
00:11:45,659 --> 00:11:48,081
[SPEAKER_02]: When I first came here, I thought, where are all the people?

189
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:49,262
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no one.

190
00:11:49,502 --> 00:11:51,645
[SPEAKER_02]: You go out on the street at 8 o'clock and you're saying,

191
00:11:52,609 --> 00:11:55,551
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm afraid, you know, that was the first year after that I got used to it.

192
00:11:55,591 --> 00:12:06,058
[SPEAKER_08]: There are a lot of communities where they roll up the sidewalks at 10, you know, where I live in Randolph now, yeah, they pretty much roll up the sidewalks at 10 o'clock.

193
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:07,839
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that, I like how you said it.

194
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,821
[SPEAKER_08]: You homeschooled your daughter?

195
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:11,361
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, indeed.

196
00:12:11,421 --> 00:12:12,221
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, okay.

197
00:12:12,582 --> 00:12:16,664
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you ever say, what the heck have I gotten myself into?

198
00:12:17,105 --> 00:12:20,927
[SPEAKER_08]: How is it different from teaching a group of young people in a traditional classroom?

199
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,982
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have the advantage of having taught in public school.

200
00:12:25,122 --> 00:12:29,284
[SPEAKER_02]: I taught for 17 years in Winchester as an eighth grade English teacher.

201
00:12:29,865 --> 00:12:31,766
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw what the pressure was on the kids.

202
00:12:32,186 --> 00:12:38,409
[SPEAKER_02]: I inadvertently added to that pressure, even though I did my best not to, and they appreciated it a lot.

203
00:12:38,449 --> 00:12:40,490
[SPEAKER_02]: You still have to because there are expectations.

204
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:43,832
[SPEAKER_02]: There's homework, there's tests, there's things you need to prepare them for.

205
00:12:44,352 --> 00:12:48,354
[SPEAKER_02]: The parents are, you know, I need my child to get into Harvard or whatever, you know.

206
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:49,175
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to,

207
00:12:49,855 --> 00:12:52,036
[SPEAKER_02]: deliver without killing their spirit.

208
00:12:53,076 --> 00:12:55,377
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did my utmost.

209
00:12:55,477 --> 00:12:56,918
[SPEAKER_02]: I worked like a dog.

210
00:12:57,018 --> 00:12:58,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, dogs don't work, but I worked very hard.

211
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:04,121
[SPEAKER_02]: I worked to make sure that I provided a safe and happy place for the students.

212
00:13:04,381 --> 00:13:07,983
[SPEAKER_02]: There would be music playing, but still, I saw what their pressure was.

213
00:13:08,343 --> 00:13:11,004
[SPEAKER_02]: When they came into the classroom, I'd have a free ride when they came in.

214
00:13:11,044 --> 00:13:12,444
[SPEAKER_02]: There'd be a prompt on the board.

215
00:13:12,484 --> 00:13:13,605
[SPEAKER_02]: There'd be some guitar music.

216
00:13:14,185 --> 00:13:21,711
[SPEAKER_02]: and there'd be plants hanging from the walls, from the ceiling, pictures, no motivational pictures, just pictures of art.

217
00:13:22,792 --> 00:13:26,335
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that was nice, but not everybody had that.

218
00:13:27,116 --> 00:13:28,537
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not blaming anyone.

219
00:13:29,858 --> 00:13:33,141
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to deliver, and public schools are great.

220
00:13:34,061 --> 00:13:35,703
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love being a public school teacher.

221
00:13:36,123 --> 00:13:37,364
[SPEAKER_02]: I still think that we need them.

222
00:13:38,905 --> 00:13:40,446
[SPEAKER_02]: People think it's either or.

223
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:42,568
[SPEAKER_02]: It's never either or.

224
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:54,495
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved being, and I would have continued being, a public school teacher had I not gotten burned out from giving 100%, 200%, if that's possible, every time.

225
00:13:54,936 --> 00:13:58,598
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was getting older and tired, so I left that.

226
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:00,039
[SPEAKER_02]: But I saw that.

227
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:05,422
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when people in my public school asked me, why are you homeschooling your daughter?

228
00:14:07,206 --> 00:14:12,947
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, there's room in the world for all kinds of people, and there's room in the world for all kinds of schooling.

229
00:14:13,707 --> 00:14:15,648
[SPEAKER_02]: There's public school, there are private schools.

230
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:17,288
[SPEAKER_02]: No one questions the private schools.

231
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:19,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are they even there?

232
00:14:19,729 --> 00:14:23,389
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the charter schools, they take, you know, some... Bits of both.

233
00:14:23,489 --> 00:14:23,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

234
00:14:23,869 --> 00:14:28,550
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, so I said, there's room for all of us, and there's room, and if you can do it, why not?

235
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:32,171
[SPEAKER_02]: And look, I'm reducing the pressure on public schools by homeschooling.

236
00:14:32,611 --> 00:14:35,972
[SPEAKER_02]: So my arguments were very logical, and they couldn't really say anything against it.

237
00:14:37,012 --> 00:14:39,593
[SPEAKER_02]: But I didn't plan to homeschool her.

238
00:14:40,353 --> 00:14:42,033
[SPEAKER_02]: It was my husband who came up with the idea.

239
00:14:42,073 --> 00:14:45,914
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, I've been in school my whole life.

240
00:14:45,994 --> 00:14:46,674
[SPEAKER_02]: I love school.

241
00:14:46,734 --> 00:14:48,055
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you mean homeschool?

242
00:14:48,155 --> 00:14:50,155
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, no, let's give it a try.

243
00:14:51,036 --> 00:14:51,616
[SPEAKER_02]: And it worked.

244
00:14:51,956 --> 00:14:53,636
[SPEAKER_02]: It worked because we are both teachers.

245
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:57,157
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know what needs to be done.

246
00:14:57,237 --> 00:15:00,178
[SPEAKER_02]: If we don't know a subject, we know how to approach not knowing it.

247
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:05,814
[SPEAKER_02]: But even those who are not teachers will tell you that homeschooling worked for their children.

248
00:15:06,314 --> 00:15:10,878
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends on how involved you are and how much you love learning.

249
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,423
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had students in my public school who said, you're homeschooling your daughter?

250
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:17,884
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I were homeschooled.

251
00:15:18,405 --> 00:15:19,085
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, no.

252
00:15:20,887 --> 00:15:22,948
[SPEAKER_02]: That mindset was already there in them.

253
00:15:23,329 --> 00:15:24,109
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter.

254
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:32,497
[SPEAKER_02]: I think schools can sometimes reduce the incentive to learn, and it's no shame on, I mean, it's the way the system is.

255
00:15:33,377 --> 00:15:41,124
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have nothing against, I mean, we're trying to do the best we can for everybody, and not everyone has the advantage of being homeschooled.

256
00:15:41,544 --> 00:15:44,607
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love the public schools because they give lunch, breakfast,

257
00:15:45,247 --> 00:15:49,270
[SPEAKER_02]: They had the kids who didn't have, I had some students who didn't have that at home.

258
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:52,052
[SPEAKER_02]: And they would come and have their free lunch or breakfast.

259
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:55,534
[SPEAKER_02]: They had access to guidance Councilors.

260
00:15:55,574 --> 00:15:57,376
[SPEAKER_02]: They had access to psychologists.

261
00:15:57,976 --> 00:15:59,197
[SPEAKER_02]: I was so grateful for that.

262
00:15:59,717 --> 00:16:01,559
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some things in homeschooling

263
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,681
[SPEAKER_02]: which could be improved.

264
00:16:04,462 --> 00:16:07,265
[SPEAKER_02]: No one really checks on you, you could be doing anything.

265
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,868
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are some good things and bad things about both.

266
00:16:09,888 --> 00:16:12,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Have I covered everything?

267
00:16:12,611 --> 00:16:17,236
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I have a sense that the accountability piece wasn't a big deal for you.

268
00:16:17,316 --> 00:16:18,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Not for us, but it could be.

269
00:16:18,217 --> 00:16:20,160
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think you needed folks checking on you.

270
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,942
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, very good, very good.

271
00:16:22,262 --> 00:16:25,083
[SPEAKER_08]: So talk a little bit about your work at Bunker Hill.

272
00:16:25,743 --> 00:16:32,426
[SPEAKER_02]: So after four years of intense homeschooling, so we were homeschooling while I was a public school teacher.

273
00:16:32,946 --> 00:16:41,729
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd come home after teaching for six hours, spending time with my students after school and coming home, and I'd read six chapters at a time of a book for my daughter.

274
00:16:41,809 --> 00:16:43,950
[SPEAKER_02]: I would leave assignments for her.

275
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,971
[SPEAKER_02]: She was not good at handwriting.

276
00:16:46,031 --> 00:16:48,954
[SPEAKER_02]: She's a great mind and wonderful speller and a great thinker.

277
00:16:49,374 --> 00:16:52,576
[SPEAKER_02]: But her handwriting was still, you know, awkward like mine is still.

278
00:16:53,117 --> 00:16:58,881
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would leave these little dotted things for her to write over when she was very little and then she got better.

279
00:17:00,122 --> 00:17:08,166
[SPEAKER_02]: I would teach her some math, Warren would teach her more math and music and woodworking and Indian and Western music.

280
00:17:08,206 --> 00:17:16,711
[SPEAKER_02]: So she learned guitar growing up and classical Indian music and we enrolled her in Indian dance class and swimming.

281
00:17:17,331 --> 00:17:27,033
[SPEAKER_02]: So all of that, so after four years of doing intensive that and nothing else, I began to feel the itch of wanting to teach in a public setting.

282
00:17:27,773 --> 00:17:33,134
[SPEAKER_02]: So I found, someone said, you should apply to Bunker Hill Community College.

283
00:17:33,214 --> 00:17:34,735
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, but don't you need a PhD?

284
00:17:34,775 --> 00:17:36,355
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said, no, not always.

285
00:17:36,835 --> 00:17:41,356
[SPEAKER_02]: So I applied, and I went through the interview process, and that was as an adjunct in 2019.

286
00:17:41,896 --> 00:17:42,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they had an opening.

287
00:17:43,677 --> 00:17:44,957
[SPEAKER_02]: I applied and interviewed.

288
00:17:45,897 --> 00:17:48,800
[SPEAKER_02]: And they gave me the job last semester, last fall.

289
00:17:49,241 --> 00:17:52,064
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is my second full year at Bunker Hill now.

290
00:17:52,124 --> 00:17:52,525
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.

291
00:17:52,845 --> 00:17:53,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

292
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:55,007
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love teaching those students.

293
00:17:55,067 --> 00:17:56,028
[SPEAKER_02]: They're fantastic.

294
00:17:56,449 --> 00:18:03,216
[SPEAKER_08]: So what surprises you most about the work that you do in teaching now, your students and such?

295
00:18:04,008 --> 00:18:11,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, when I first entered the college, and Bunker Hill is quite a sprawling place, I knew very little about it.

296
00:18:11,737 --> 00:18:15,761
[SPEAKER_02]: I frankly didn't know anything about community colleges, shame on me, but I didn't.

297
00:18:16,442 --> 00:18:17,603
[SPEAKER_02]: And I learned rapidly.

298
00:18:18,344 --> 00:18:21,568
[SPEAKER_02]: And the first sense was that I have entered the United Nations.

299
00:18:22,608 --> 00:18:24,209
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved being there.

300
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:37,438
[SPEAKER_02]: So many brown faces, so many Africans from Africa, so many African-Americans, so many Spanish speakers, so many people from various countries, from Eastern Europe, from India, from Pakistan, Bangladesh.

301
00:18:38,018 --> 00:18:38,879
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved it.

302
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,902
[SPEAKER_02]: China and some Japanese students and some Vietnamese students.

303
00:18:44,443 --> 00:18:45,883
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had students from everywhere.

304
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:52,790
[SPEAKER_02]: They came with different strengths, and it was lovely to teach them.

305
00:18:53,371 --> 00:18:54,452
[SPEAKER_02]: They were there to learn.

306
00:18:54,472 --> 00:19:02,260
[SPEAKER_02]: The difference between teaching children, and again, no offense, children are beautiful to teach, and grown-ups is that

307
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:05,031
[SPEAKER_02]: The grown-ups are there because they want to learn.

308
00:19:05,771 --> 00:19:07,532
[SPEAKER_02]: And the children are there because they're made to go to school.

309
00:19:07,912 --> 00:19:09,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's face it.

310
00:19:09,112 --> 00:19:11,473
[SPEAKER_02]: They'd rather be outside playing, and who can blame them?

311
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:16,075
[SPEAKER_02]: But I love teaching these students.

312
00:19:16,195 --> 00:19:24,258
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was hard because there was a multiplicity of educational systems to which they had been differently exposed.

313
00:19:24,938 --> 00:19:27,840
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I had to figure out how to make it

314
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:34,464
[SPEAKER_02]: equitable for all without dumbing down the syllabus and making it inspiring.

315
00:19:34,604 --> 00:19:45,831
[SPEAKER_02]: So they had to read William Zinsser, or Kurt Vonnegut, or Virginia Woolf, or James Baldwin, who is very hard for even English speakers to read.

316
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,532
[SPEAKER_02]: He is such an intellectual giant.

317
00:19:48,092 --> 00:19:56,217
[SPEAKER_02]: I made sure we read Maya Angelou, we read people from various places, Sandra Cisneros, some Indian writers as well.

318
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:01,313
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to represent the multiplicity of voices.

319
00:20:02,725 --> 00:20:08,228
[SPEAKER_02]: to represent in class for them to relate to at different levels.

320
00:20:08,868 --> 00:20:11,050
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, look, you may not understand the language.

321
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:14,091
[SPEAKER_02]: I will read all of the words and all of the sentences.

322
00:20:14,371 --> 00:20:16,192
[SPEAKER_02]: I recorded hours of this stuff.

323
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:22,676
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, look, I will read, I will stop, I will explain each sentence if it's difficult, every word.

324
00:20:23,196 --> 00:20:24,117
[SPEAKER_02]: And they really liked it.

325
00:20:24,197 --> 00:20:24,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

326
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:26,198
[SPEAKER_02]: They were willing to go with me.

327
00:20:26,218 --> 00:20:27,219
[SPEAKER_02]: How beautiful.

328
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:29,260
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a lot of work, but I liked it a lot.

329
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:47,698
[SPEAKER_08]: So you went through, obviously, the heart of the COVID-19 scourge, and it's changed the way that we behave in general, but how did it change the way that you approached collegiate teaching?

330
00:20:51,776 --> 00:20:53,437
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to teach a lot online.

331
00:20:54,498 --> 00:20:56,599
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was a rapid learning for me.

332
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:05,746
[SPEAKER_02]: I went from not knowing anything about learning management systems to learning it as fast as possible and using every possibility it offered.

333
00:21:06,126 --> 00:21:06,626
[SPEAKER_02]: That was great.

334
00:21:06,706 --> 00:21:07,807
[SPEAKER_02]: I like learning new things.

335
00:21:08,187 --> 00:21:09,508
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter what it is.

336
00:21:10,109 --> 00:21:11,270
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was fun for me.

337
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:15,012
[SPEAKER_02]: And I learned how to use all of the technological stuff available.

338
00:21:15,693 --> 00:21:19,636
[SPEAKER_02]: And they gave us some training, but I also poked around and figured out some stuff.

339
00:21:20,496 --> 00:21:25,861
[SPEAKER_02]: And so most of the classes were online, but then they began to have them in person.

340
00:21:26,841 --> 00:21:28,883
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that was nice, to have both.

341
00:21:29,343 --> 00:21:40,713
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to shift gears a little bit, and I wanted to ask you, what made you decide to apply for the Poet Laureate's Opportunity in Medford?

342
00:21:41,454 --> 00:21:42,955
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually knew nothing about it.

343
00:21:43,495 --> 00:21:48,637
[SPEAKER_02]: A friend of mine, which is not actually a friend, an acquaintance, whose children took my poetry club.

344
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:51,438
[SPEAKER_02]: I teach homeschoolers online.

345
00:21:51,558 --> 00:21:52,499
[SPEAKER_02]: I call it Poetry Club.

346
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:53,059
[SPEAKER_02]: And they come.

347
00:21:53,439 --> 00:21:55,360
[SPEAKER_02]: I have children from various towns.

348
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,501
[SPEAKER_02]: And so her children were in Medford.

349
00:21:57,761 --> 00:21:58,601
[SPEAKER_02]: She lives in Medford.

350
00:21:58,701 --> 00:22:01,342
[SPEAKER_02]: And she said, you know, this thing is being advertised.

351
00:22:01,682 --> 00:22:02,363
[SPEAKER_02]: You should apply.

352
00:22:03,243 --> 00:22:04,464
[SPEAKER_02]: My children rave about you.

353
00:22:05,004 --> 00:22:07,765
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, because I wasn't reading the paper.

354
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:08,926
[SPEAKER_02]: I was too busy teaching.

355
00:22:09,006 --> 00:22:09,306
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

356
00:22:09,727 --> 00:22:10,607
[SPEAKER_02]: So I didn't see it.

357
00:22:10,927 --> 00:22:11,968
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said, you should apply.

358
00:22:11,988 --> 00:22:12,668
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, OK.

359
00:22:13,348 --> 00:22:16,790
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first time I applied, but I didn't get it.

360
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:17,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Terry got it.

361
00:22:19,191 --> 00:22:19,752
[SPEAKER_02]: This is great.

362
00:22:19,932 --> 00:22:21,393
[SPEAKER_02]: I was so happy you got it.

363
00:22:21,533 --> 00:22:24,154
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not feel bad at all, not one whit.

364
00:22:24,614 --> 00:22:25,735
[SPEAKER_02]: So just letting you know that.

365
00:22:25,755 --> 00:22:26,415
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, thank you.

366
00:22:26,435 --> 00:22:27,256
[SPEAKER_02]: The second time.

367
00:22:27,896 --> 00:22:35,178
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just so pleased that it was there, that they chose a worthy person for it.

368
00:22:35,218 --> 00:22:38,119
[SPEAKER_02]: And a delightful, worthy, and wonderful poet.

369
00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:39,279
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.

370
00:22:40,199 --> 00:22:44,000
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sucking up because I have no dog in this game anymore, right?

371
00:22:46,121 --> 00:22:46,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Dog in this fight.

372
00:22:47,021 --> 00:22:51,682
[SPEAKER_02]: See, this is an American idiom which I have just used for the first time.

373
00:22:51,743 --> 00:22:54,243
[SPEAKER_08]: We do a bunch of stuff that we don't even understand.

374
00:22:54,543 --> 00:22:55,123
[SPEAKER_08]: Dog in this fight.

375
00:22:57,384 --> 00:22:59,625
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I almost didn't apply for this year's.

376
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:02,925
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually thought, nah, why?

377
00:23:03,526 --> 00:23:04,886
[SPEAKER_02]: So the same person reminded me.

378
00:23:05,026 --> 00:23:07,106
[SPEAKER_02]: And two or three other people said, you should apply.

379
00:23:07,126 --> 00:23:08,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Heather Meeker Green.

380
00:23:09,927 --> 00:23:10,927
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought she might be here today.

381
00:23:11,267 --> 00:23:13,048
[SPEAKER_02]: She runs the farmer's market.

382
00:23:13,108 --> 00:23:13,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

383
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:14,648
[SPEAKER_02]: So she said, you should apply.

384
00:23:14,668 --> 00:23:16,009
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, but really?

385
00:23:16,089 --> 00:23:16,689
[SPEAKER_02]: And she said, yes.

386
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:17,449
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did.

387
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:21,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much before midnight on the day that it was due.

388
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:35,439
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, when I found out that they weren't going to extend my term of office and that they definitely wanted to go with a new laureate every two years, you were the first one that I thought of.

389
00:23:35,459 --> 00:23:37,061
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

390
00:23:38,303 --> 00:23:40,226
[SPEAKER_08]: I said to myself, I hope she applies.

391
00:23:40,286 --> 00:23:40,766
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

392
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:48,336
[SPEAKER_08]: And full disclosure, they didn't really ask my opinion.

393
00:23:49,077 --> 00:23:53,663
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would have been on the horns of a bit of a dilemma because I'm friends with folks.

394
00:23:57,588 --> 00:24:05,095
[SPEAKER_08]: But really, I thought that it was a feather in their cap, so to speak, to have you.

395
00:24:05,756 --> 00:24:14,043
[SPEAKER_08]: And I wasn't at all sheepish about sharing the distinction with you because, like I said in the piece,

396
00:24:15,936 --> 00:24:16,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Pass the torch along.

397
00:24:16,837 --> 00:24:17,357
[SPEAKER_02]: It's moving on.

398
00:24:17,377 --> 00:24:23,980
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like that, actually, that we can have many poets coming, because Medford has some really, really good poets.

399
00:24:24,441 --> 00:24:24,781
[SPEAKER_08]: It does.

400
00:24:24,861 --> 00:24:27,202
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple of others who I hope will apply.

401
00:24:27,242 --> 00:24:29,684
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

402
00:24:30,924 --> 00:24:37,248
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know this is subject to change, because the landscape constantly shifts under our feet creatively.

403
00:24:37,668 --> 00:24:38,588
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you have a vision,

404
00:24:42,011 --> 00:24:50,180
[SPEAKER_08]: of maybe some of the things that you'd like to do, or some of the things that you'd like to see as Poet Laureate, what would it be?

405
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,783
[SPEAKER_08]: What are some of the things you maybe thought about?

406
00:24:53,224 --> 00:24:58,730
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was actually thinking, and I don't know how this would work out, but I do want to run

407
00:24:59,651 --> 00:25:02,693
[SPEAKER_02]: both an online and in-person poetry club.

408
00:25:04,375 --> 00:25:17,785
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was wondering, and you can tell me what you think of this, whether it's okay to have one separately for older people and one separately for younger people or mingle and mix and have them, I have to find out where I can hold it.

409
00:25:18,245 --> 00:25:25,471
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was thinking of asking the public library or maybe here to run a poetry workshop, to invite other poets.

410
00:25:26,451 --> 00:25:45,424
[SPEAKER_02]: to just have fun because people want to write, people want to express and poetry I think is one of the most succinct ways in which we can convey emotion and intellect and ideas and joy and sorrow and all of those things without having to go into a long novel or you know explain everything.

411
00:25:46,004 --> 00:25:48,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes the non-explanation helps.

412
00:25:49,207 --> 00:25:54,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes people just want to be allusive and obtuse.

413
00:25:55,013 --> 00:25:56,295
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes they want to be direct.

414
00:25:56,395 --> 00:25:58,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Both are great in poetry.

415
00:25:58,137 --> 00:25:59,018
[SPEAKER_08]: Fully acceptable.

416
00:25:59,579 --> 00:26:03,984
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean those 17 syllables in a haiku sometimes is all that needs to be said.

417
00:26:04,364 --> 00:26:07,027
[SPEAKER_08]: And then sometimes like me, I'm a long form poet.

418
00:26:07,067 --> 00:26:07,928
[SPEAKER_07]: I like long form.

419
00:26:08,989 --> 00:26:12,512
[SPEAKER_08]: I like to go in, as they say, and stay there for a little while.

420
00:26:12,572 --> 00:26:13,373
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah.

421
00:26:13,553 --> 00:26:14,874
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah.

422
00:26:14,934 --> 00:26:16,796
[SPEAKER_08]: First of all, I think it's a wonderful idea.

423
00:26:16,816 --> 00:26:24,422
[SPEAKER_08]: And there are a couple of things that I did that kind of scratched at the surface, but never really got there fully.

424
00:26:26,144 --> 00:26:34,171
[SPEAKER_08]: If we were talking about doing it collaboratively or whatever, I probably would

425
00:26:35,566 --> 00:26:38,928
[SPEAKER_08]: I wouldn't necessarily want to separate the age groups.

426
00:26:39,028 --> 00:26:40,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I wouldn't either, really.

427
00:26:40,709 --> 00:26:50,655
[SPEAKER_08]: But I also believe that in some instances, young people are far more willing to share with their peer group.

428
00:26:50,935 --> 00:26:51,635
[SPEAKER_02]: There is that.

429
00:26:51,976 --> 00:26:53,917
[SPEAKER_08]: And they are intergenerational.

430
00:26:53,937 --> 00:26:57,279
[SPEAKER_08]: I think what you can do, though, is- Maybe an intersection?

431
00:26:57,819 --> 00:26:58,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

432
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:02,721
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like Venn diagrams, so they can separate, separate every now and then, get them together.

433
00:27:02,741 --> 00:27:03,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

434
00:27:03,401 --> 00:27:04,122
[SPEAKER_08]: That'd be fun.

435
00:27:04,342 --> 00:27:07,283
[SPEAKER_08]: Three weeks separate, two weeks together, three weeks separate.

436
00:27:07,363 --> 00:27:08,303
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds really nice.

437
00:27:08,803 --> 00:27:11,024
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, I think that's fantastic.

438
00:27:11,484 --> 00:27:17,487
[SPEAKER_08]: So for you, I know that music is a huge part of your creative life.

439
00:27:17,947 --> 00:27:20,308
[SPEAKER_08]: What kinds of things are you doing musically right now?

440
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:29,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, my husband and I and my daughter, who's now a freshman at UMass Amherst and has been there for exactly one week.

441
00:27:30,807 --> 00:27:32,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Normally we sing every night together.

442
00:27:32,749 --> 00:27:35,933
[SPEAKER_02]: We sing madrigals, 16th century madrigals.

443
00:27:36,754 --> 00:27:41,296
[SPEAKER_02]: And we sing some old jazz standards and some folk songs sometimes.

444
00:27:41,756 --> 00:27:42,876
[SPEAKER_02]: We play guitar together.

445
00:27:43,016 --> 00:27:44,136
[SPEAKER_02]: All three of us play guitar.

446
00:27:44,777 --> 00:27:45,857
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I do that.

447
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:47,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now it's just Warren and me.

448
00:27:47,717 --> 00:27:52,239
[SPEAKER_02]: And so at home we go over those songs together and miss the third voice of our child.

449
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:58,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than that, I have returned to playing the sitar.

450
00:27:58,924 --> 00:28:04,568
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a trained sitarist, studied with a student who was a senior disciple of Pandit Ravi Shankar.

451
00:28:04,608 --> 00:28:09,191
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been 18 or 20 years since I played the sitar seriously.

452
00:28:13,614 --> 00:28:16,295
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got myself another used sitar.

453
00:28:16,355 --> 00:28:18,316
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a sitar of my own but that needs work.

454
00:28:18,996 --> 00:28:22,898
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had it since I was 16 years old and I brought it to America with me when I came in 1988.

455
00:28:23,998 --> 00:28:28,500
[SPEAKER_02]: But I got another sitar that somebody was selling on FB marketplace.

456
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,421
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was skeptical.

457
00:28:30,481 --> 00:28:30,981
[SPEAKER_02]: I checked it out.

458
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:32,502
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a really good sitar.

459
00:28:33,782 --> 00:28:34,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a bad one, anyway.

460
00:28:35,563 --> 00:28:37,204
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I started playing it.

461
00:28:37,224 --> 00:28:41,166
[SPEAKER_02]: And I played it practically every day, with the exception of four days somewhere in there.

462
00:28:41,786 --> 00:28:46,729
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm trying to get back to doing that music as well, my Indian classical music.

463
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:59,198
[SPEAKER_02]: For a long time, Warren and I also performed Hindustani vocal music together, but again, my voice is not its old self, so it's not as flexible, and I need to get back in shape.

464
00:28:59,659 --> 00:29:01,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything needs to get back in shape.

465
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,642
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so annoying to be older.

466
00:29:03,662 --> 00:29:04,843
[SPEAKER_08]: Preaching to the choir there.

467
00:29:05,423 --> 00:29:06,364
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, all right.

468
00:29:06,684 --> 00:29:18,748
[SPEAKER_08]: So, and you did mention one, obviously, and he's the artistic influence for a lot of folks, particularly in Indian music, but who are some of your artistic influences in music and art and poetry?

469
00:29:20,299 --> 00:29:26,006
[SPEAKER_02]: In music, I love the Beatles.

470
00:29:26,767 --> 00:29:30,671
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew up listening to the Beatles, so that was my earliest Western music.

471
00:29:31,752 --> 00:29:35,697
[SPEAKER_02]: I also heard Louis Armstrong, who was famous all over the world.

472
00:29:37,058 --> 00:29:38,420
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I never heard of Duke.

473
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,663
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I heard of him, but I never heard him.

474
00:29:42,264 --> 00:29:43,426
[SPEAKER_02]: I listened to Frank Sinatra.

475
00:29:44,167 --> 00:29:47,571
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of Karen Carpenter.

476
00:29:48,231 --> 00:29:49,152
[SPEAKER_00]: Queen.

477
00:29:49,633 --> 00:29:52,436
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the 70s, you know, and we listened to Karen Carpenter.

478
00:29:52,456 --> 00:29:53,117
[SPEAKER_02]: She was sweet.

479
00:29:53,337 --> 00:29:54,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, very sweet music.

480
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:57,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Lovely voice, but some songs are carol king.

481
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:04,163
[SPEAKER_02]: And I listen to, of course, Jethro Tull, and Queen, and Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young.

482
00:30:04,703 --> 00:30:07,185
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are some of the Western music influences.

483
00:30:07,265 --> 00:30:15,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Indian music, Ravi Shankar, Vimsin Joshi, some of the Indian vocalists that won't be familiar to some of you.

484
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:18,250
[SPEAKER_02]: MS Subbulakshmi, she's very famous.

485
00:30:19,231 --> 00:30:20,412
[SPEAKER_02]: So I listen to a lot of them.

486
00:30:21,292 --> 00:30:23,215
[SPEAKER_02]: growing up, it was playing in the house.

487
00:30:23,676 --> 00:30:31,508
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, Indian Bollywood songs that were on the radio all over the place, blaring from houses, from rickshaws, from everywhere.

488
00:30:32,529 --> 00:30:33,310
[SPEAKER_02]: It was in the air.

489
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:34,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Warren can attest to that.

490
00:30:34,672 --> 00:30:36,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Music is in the air.

491
00:30:37,176 --> 00:30:53,267
[SPEAKER_02]: like you cannot help but pick it up it's like that and no one thinks twice if you burst into song on the street here you have to think oh my god you know i remember being very wary about singing now i don't care i sing if i want to it doesn't matter but over there it was just you know everybody sang

492
00:30:53,627 --> 00:31:16,320
[SPEAKER_02]: okay and you know you'd get in a train or something and a blind man with a little boy might come with a one-stringed instrument and sing the most unearthly beautiful music and then get off the train and maybe get make a few bits of you know few paisa few coins yeah coins and then go off so you know music was everywhere yeah I love it so that's in music and what was your other

493
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:19,041
[SPEAKER_08]: Art, poetry, poetry in particular, yeah.

494
00:31:19,381 --> 00:31:20,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Poetry, yeah.

495
00:31:21,342 --> 00:31:27,284
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a teacher in the seventh standard, seventh grade as you'd say here.

496
00:31:28,585 --> 00:31:31,946
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to a convent school, so that's a separate story.

497
00:31:32,587 --> 00:31:35,548
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a child of Indian Tamil Brahmins who

498
00:31:36,808 --> 00:31:43,693
[SPEAKER_02]: like several other Tamilians and Brahmins, sent their children to convent schools because that's where you got the best education.

499
00:31:44,173 --> 00:31:48,216
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said, well, in an English-speaking world, we want our children to have the best chance.

500
00:31:48,716 --> 00:31:52,199
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were all forced to speak in English in class, in school.

501
00:31:52,579 --> 00:31:54,660
[SPEAKER_02]: None of us were encouraged to speak in our own language.

502
00:31:54,940 --> 00:32:02,365
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm embarrassed about that now when I think about it, because I didn't grow up... I grew up speaking my language at home, but not in school.

503
00:32:02,686 --> 00:32:04,167
[SPEAKER_02]: And with my friends, I spoke English.

504
00:32:04,267 --> 00:32:05,367
[SPEAKER_02]: We all speak English.

505
00:32:06,688 --> 00:32:13,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so in Seventh Standard, the nun who was teaching us, Sister Lina, I've acknowledged her in my poetry book.

506
00:32:14,013 --> 00:32:15,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Sister Lina was lovely.

507
00:32:15,553 --> 00:32:20,196
[SPEAKER_02]: She was a very stern but beautiful-faced woman with a habit.

508
00:32:20,236 --> 00:32:22,017
[SPEAKER_02]: In those days, they were the full habit.

509
00:32:22,077 --> 00:32:24,439
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how they survived Chennai heat.

510
00:32:24,739 --> 00:32:26,580
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they switched to saris, thank goodness.

511
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,741
[SPEAKER_02]: But they were the full habit.

512
00:32:28,861 --> 00:32:30,982
[SPEAKER_02]: And she would read us Wordsworth.

513
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:32,784
[SPEAKER_02]: And my ears perked up.

514
00:32:32,844 --> 00:32:34,565
[SPEAKER_02]: So William Wordsworth was the first.

515
00:32:35,325 --> 00:32:37,346
[SPEAKER_02]: poet who caught my fancy.

516
00:32:37,547 --> 00:32:38,567
[SPEAKER_08]: Lyrical poets, yes.

517
00:32:38,667 --> 00:32:41,729
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved the romantics and the lyrical poets at that time.

518
00:32:41,769 --> 00:32:48,534
[SPEAKER_02]: So I also loved Sarojini Naidu, who was an Indian poet from the freedom struggle era.

519
00:32:49,174 --> 00:32:55,298
[SPEAKER_02]: And she wrote in English, but she wrote beautiful sort of lyrical poems about Indian situations.

520
00:32:55,719 --> 00:32:59,361
[SPEAKER_02]: And Rabindranath Tagore, the great Indian poet who won the Nobel Prize.

521
00:32:59,381 --> 00:33:00,942
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

522
00:33:00,962 --> 00:33:03,524
[SPEAKER_02]: He wrote in Bengali, but his translations were lovely.

523
00:33:03,644 --> 00:33:05,205
[SPEAKER_02]: And I grew up reading his work.

524
00:33:06,146 --> 00:33:08,568
[SPEAKER_02]: And then of course Keats and Shelley and the rest of them.

525
00:33:09,348 --> 00:33:12,851
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Emily Dickinson and Robert Frost, I loved them.

526
00:33:14,612 --> 00:33:16,054
[SPEAKER_02]: And a whole lot of other poets.

527
00:33:16,374 --> 00:33:17,975
[SPEAKER_02]: I read everything that came my way.

528
00:33:18,616 --> 00:33:34,268
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was 10, actually, my neighbor Sunda, which was short for Sundaram, which is like my name, he was a writer and a journalist who had this beautiful, pristine bookcase, glass, several glass-covered bookcases in his house.

529
00:33:34,548 --> 00:33:37,251
[SPEAKER_02]: He'd invite me over, and he and his wife would be very kind to us.

530
00:33:37,311 --> 00:33:38,912
[SPEAKER_02]: His children were grown, and they had children.

531
00:33:39,673 --> 00:33:48,080
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd jump over the wall from my house to his house, and I'd go and stare like a kid in a candy store, because I loved books.

532
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,922
[SPEAKER_02]: I read them nonstop.

533
00:33:50,723 --> 00:33:51,483
[SPEAKER_02]: I had no life.

534
00:33:51,603 --> 00:33:54,826
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, other kids, you know, I would climb trees like Maria von Trapp.

535
00:33:55,187 --> 00:33:56,227
[SPEAKER_02]: I would scrape my knees.

536
00:33:57,388 --> 00:33:58,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, by the way, that was a big influence.

537
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:04,213
[SPEAKER_02]: And I looked at his books and I saw the complete works of Oscar Wilde.

538
00:34:04,253 --> 00:34:06,334
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw the complete works of William Shakespeare.

539
00:34:06,734 --> 00:34:10,156
[SPEAKER_02]: He also, he loaned me my Rabindranath Tagore and he said, keep it.

540
00:34:10,696 --> 00:34:13,057
[SPEAKER_02]: He gave me the Oscar Wilde which came with me to America in 1988.

541
00:34:15,438 --> 00:34:26,406
[SPEAKER_02]: I came with three big books, the complete works of William Shakespeare that my father gave me, the complete works of Oscar Wilde that Mr. Sundar gave me, and all of the Rabindranath Tagore.

542
00:34:26,667 --> 00:34:33,612
[SPEAKER_02]: So his books, they were selections of poetry, so I can't even name all of them, there were so many, but I read all of those.

543
00:34:34,812 --> 00:34:37,795
[SPEAKER_02]: When it came time for me to go to college, I'd read everything.

544
00:34:37,855 --> 00:34:39,296
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had the best college life.

545
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:40,918
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't need to study a thing.

546
00:34:41,018 --> 00:34:42,179
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, hi, hi.

547
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,680
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just did my work.

548
00:34:44,081 --> 00:34:44,461
[SPEAKER_08]: Perfect.

549
00:34:44,741 --> 00:34:45,222
[SPEAKER_08]: Perfect.

550
00:34:45,642 --> 00:34:46,283
[SPEAKER_08]: Perfect.

551
00:34:46,343 --> 00:34:49,846
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to keep track of time because there's a couple of things I want to make sure we get to.

552
00:34:52,483 --> 00:35:07,067
[SPEAKER_08]: So as you think about some collaborations and youth poetry and engaging more folks in the appreciation of the literary arts in Medford, what do you see as some of the possible challenges and some potential opportunities?

553
00:35:09,668 --> 00:35:10,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Challenges?

554
00:35:12,992 --> 00:35:16,954
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't even think about what the challenges are because I haven't encountered them yet.

555
00:35:17,154 --> 00:35:19,675
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll have to be a flight of imagination right now.

556
00:35:20,115 --> 00:35:22,176
[SPEAKER_02]: I can imagine someone saying, why poetry?

557
00:35:22,196 --> 00:35:25,117
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the big deal?

558
00:35:25,417 --> 00:35:26,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Why should I write poetry?

559
00:35:26,578 --> 00:35:28,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are you coming and bothering me with this stuff?

560
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:33,521
[SPEAKER_02]: I might try and rope them in with some beautiful poems and songs.

561
00:35:33,541 --> 00:35:34,101
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

562
00:35:34,201 --> 00:35:36,322
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll try to get them dancing to something.

563
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:36,822
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

564
00:35:37,142 --> 00:35:37,964
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea yet.

565
00:35:38,084 --> 00:35:39,326
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.

566
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:44,036
[SPEAKER_02]: But the opportunities, I think I'm going to combine music and poetry.

567
00:35:45,739 --> 00:35:46,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything has a rhythm.

568
00:35:47,501 --> 00:35:48,022
[SPEAKER_08]: I love it.

569
00:35:48,402 --> 00:35:49,142
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my gosh.

570
00:35:49,563 --> 00:35:50,063
[SPEAKER_08]: Maracas.

571
00:35:50,143 --> 00:35:50,664
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

572
00:35:51,004 --> 00:35:52,765
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll bring my guitar, my maracas.

573
00:35:52,845 --> 00:35:55,307
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a dulcimer that Warren got me as a present once.

574
00:35:55,327 --> 00:35:56,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my goodness.

575
00:35:56,248 --> 00:35:57,849
[SPEAKER_02]: And see what I can do.

576
00:35:58,029 --> 00:36:09,198
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's funny because, and maybe I thought about it once or twice, but I was never really thinking that.

577
00:36:10,139 --> 00:36:15,083
[SPEAKER_08]: I wasn't thinking the way I should have been about the intersection of poetry and music.

578
00:36:15,963 --> 00:36:17,483
[SPEAKER_08]: But you performed.

579
00:36:17,704 --> 00:36:18,204
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, yeah.

580
00:36:18,464 --> 00:36:24,625
[SPEAKER_08]: I had done a little bit, but meeting Jonathan Fagan kind of changed my trajectory considerably.

581
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:32,227
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have a CD coming out sometime in the next couple of months of the jazz that we do.

582
00:36:32,247 --> 00:36:36,668
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's become the intersection of jazz and social justice.

583
00:36:36,688 --> 00:36:37,868
[SPEAKER_08]: So it makes perfect sense.

584
00:36:38,589 --> 00:36:43,790
[SPEAKER_08]: And it particularly makes a lot of sense when you're thinking about young people.

585
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:54,337
[SPEAKER_08]: because so much of the social information that they receive, and even the social contract that they begin to build in their own minds, comes via the music that they listen to.

586
00:36:54,357 --> 00:36:55,177
[SPEAKER_08]: That's so true.

587
00:36:55,338 --> 00:37:09,047
[SPEAKER_08]: So if positive messages and poetry can be blended with the kind of music that they're interested in listening to, and even some that they might not be, but get exposed to and say, ooh, this is a thing.

588
00:37:09,147 --> 00:37:10,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.

589
00:37:10,127 --> 00:37:12,009
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think it's cool.

590
00:37:14,431 --> 00:37:21,769
[SPEAKER_08]: So, what would people who are just meeting you be surprised to learn about you?

591
00:37:25,374 --> 00:37:26,595
[SPEAKER_02]: What surprised you about me?

592
00:37:27,496 --> 00:37:28,736
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, I shouldn't ask a question.

593
00:37:28,756 --> 00:37:30,518
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's good, it's good.

594
00:37:30,878 --> 00:37:32,199
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a fair question.

595
00:37:32,219 --> 00:37:39,063
[SPEAKER_08]: I think what surprised me about you is how genial you are.

596
00:37:41,344 --> 00:37:42,965
[SPEAKER_08]: If that's the word that I can use.

597
00:37:43,025 --> 00:37:47,888
[SPEAKER_08]: How ready you are to embrace the potential for friendship.

598
00:37:49,329 --> 00:37:54,931
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you didn't know me from a can of paint, but you knew that I was a poet.

599
00:37:55,631 --> 00:37:58,972
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think you maybe gave me a little bit of credit for that.

600
00:37:59,032 --> 00:38:08,214
[SPEAKER_08]: But when we talked, I immediately got the sense from you that here is a person that is ready to embrace a friendship.

601
00:38:08,714 --> 00:38:17,977
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, you didn't know me, but it sounded to me like you had already said to yourself, well, if he's willing, I would like to be his friend.

602
00:38:19,386 --> 00:38:21,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's a lovely thing.

603
00:38:21,146 --> 00:38:21,747
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?

604
00:38:23,707 --> 00:38:24,767
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes both ways.

605
00:38:24,847 --> 00:38:30,109
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you are one of the most generous, genial people I have met.

606
00:38:30,789 --> 00:38:39,471
[SPEAKER_02]: And you were so warm and welcoming of me and Max and Julia, the other poets who we performed with.

607
00:38:40,032 --> 00:38:41,172
[SPEAKER_02]: And you just, you didn't...

608
00:38:41,872 --> 00:38:45,113
[SPEAKER_02]: begrudge us our poetry.

609
00:38:45,513 --> 00:38:47,033
[SPEAKER_02]: You just come on in.

610
00:38:47,594 --> 00:38:50,634
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you made it possible for us to feel that way.

611
00:38:50,734 --> 00:38:53,175
[SPEAKER_02]: And so thank you for that comment.

612
00:38:53,195 --> 00:38:53,475
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome.

613
00:38:53,495 --> 00:38:56,696
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think you are also a very genial person.

614
00:38:56,716 --> 00:38:56,956
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

615
00:38:57,356 --> 00:38:57,836
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

616
00:38:57,856 --> 00:38:58,876
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate that.

617
00:39:01,417 --> 00:39:04,579
[SPEAKER_08]: It's lovely to hear it and it felt good to say it.

618
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,560
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

619
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,601
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, absolutely.

620
00:39:06,661 --> 00:39:08,382
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what would surprise people.

621
00:39:08,442 --> 00:39:10,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe the fact that I have a dot.

622
00:39:10,784 --> 00:39:12,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the dot even in the middle of my voice?

623
00:39:13,566 --> 00:39:15,708
[SPEAKER_08]: It's sitting where it's supposed to sit, I think.

624
00:39:15,868 --> 00:39:16,789
[SPEAKER_02]: It moves around.

625
00:39:17,049 --> 00:39:17,789
[SPEAKER_02]: It has a mind of its own.

626
00:39:17,849 --> 00:39:18,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

627
00:39:20,311 --> 00:39:23,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it shows up on my shoulder, I have no idea.

628
00:39:24,152 --> 00:39:32,374
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I have a dot and people wonder whether that's a sign of religion and yes it is for people but for me it's an identity marker.

629
00:39:32,634 --> 00:39:33,974
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all it is for me.

630
00:39:34,535 --> 00:39:44,837
[SPEAKER_02]: It reminds me, it's my umbilicus, it reminds me of my past and holds me to that because it's very easy to get swept up in whatever culture you're in.

631
00:39:45,457 --> 00:39:48,218
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very easy to forget.

632
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:53,740
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to remember some part of who you were.

633
00:39:54,201 --> 00:40:01,144
[SPEAKER_02]: And any person who thinks enough will reinvent himself, herself, themselves as time goes on.

634
00:40:01,244 --> 00:40:04,586
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are constantly shedding the skin of our past selves.

635
00:40:05,566 --> 00:40:07,287
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't want to forget that part.

636
00:40:07,427 --> 00:40:09,028
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that part is beautiful.

637
00:40:09,328 --> 00:40:10,068
[SPEAKER_08]: It's wonderful.

638
00:40:10,348 --> 00:40:11,009
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.

639
00:40:11,269 --> 00:40:11,689
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.

640
00:40:11,969 --> 00:40:21,420
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the other thing that, you know, it didn't surprise me to learn about you because I had a sense that this was going to be the case.

641
00:40:21,881 --> 00:40:27,167
[SPEAKER_08]: But in hearing you talk, and particularly in hearing you to read, just the...

642
00:40:28,228 --> 00:40:30,890
[SPEAKER_08]: just kind of the lyrical nature of your voice.

643
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:35,092
[SPEAKER_08]: It sounds like singing, even when it's just talking.

644
00:40:35,292 --> 00:40:36,813
[SPEAKER_07]: Lovely, thank you.

645
00:40:37,253 --> 00:40:50,381
[SPEAKER_08]: And for me, because I always like to think that that's what I do, that the rhythm and the lyrical nature of what I'm trying to get across, I'm always hopeful that people hear that.

646
00:40:50,421 --> 00:40:52,142
[SPEAKER_08]: They say, you don't do that.

647
00:40:52,502 --> 00:40:53,923
[SPEAKER_08]: Man, that's musical, brother.

648
00:40:54,463 --> 00:41:12,601
[SPEAKER_08]: that jazz thing you just got that flow right and i'm even meeting you know brothers that you know they're a little bit more hardcore you know they you know they i say like we say they from the hood you know what i'm saying and so when they hear me they're they're like yo man i'm

649
00:41:13,181 --> 00:41:14,582
[SPEAKER_08]: Yo, do you rap?

650
00:41:14,622 --> 00:41:16,703
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you rap?

651
00:41:17,123 --> 00:41:26,827
[SPEAKER_08]: I said, not knowingly, not intentionally, but a lot of where I'm coming from has kind of that lyrical edge to it.

652
00:41:28,008 --> 00:41:40,474
[SPEAKER_08]: And especially when I'm going deep on some of these themes of social justice, because I know that younger people won't receive it the way that I want them to unless it kind of comes at them

653
00:41:40,894 --> 00:41:43,055
[SPEAKER_08]: with a bit more of an edge to it.

654
00:41:43,315 --> 00:41:45,056
[SPEAKER_08]: So I have those places in me, too.

655
00:41:45,076 --> 00:41:48,858
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the internal rhymes and the end rhymes that you have.

656
00:41:48,898 --> 00:41:49,819
[SPEAKER_02]: They're so wonderful.

657
00:41:49,899 --> 00:41:55,142
[SPEAKER_02]: And the consonances and assonances that you use in your writing, it's very rhythmic and flowing.

658
00:41:55,322 --> 00:41:55,762
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

659
00:41:55,882 --> 00:41:56,782
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

660
00:41:58,463 --> 00:42:05,947
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't want the people to leave without hearing how wonderful a poet you are and you have your new book with you.

661
00:42:05,987 --> 00:42:08,529
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was wondering if you would read a couple of pieces for us.

662
00:42:10,876 --> 00:42:13,378
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, can you hear me well at the back?

663
00:42:13,578 --> 00:42:14,238
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, thank you.

664
00:42:14,739 --> 00:42:19,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Because sometimes people say I'm not speaking into the mic, so I just want to make sure.

665
00:42:19,302 --> 00:42:19,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

666
00:42:21,383 --> 00:42:21,803
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

667
00:42:24,225 --> 00:42:29,168
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't actually plan to decide which one to read, so let me see.

668
00:42:29,188 --> 00:42:29,808
[SPEAKER_02]: It's OK.

669
00:42:36,846 --> 00:42:43,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, this is a more personal one, personal in the sense of not revealing my history or anything, but about my body.

670
00:42:44,651 --> 00:42:45,392
[SPEAKER_02]: My body.

671
00:42:45,412 --> 00:42:48,614
[SPEAKER_02]: A body is a curious thing to possess.

672
00:42:49,375 --> 00:42:56,520
[SPEAKER_02]: I am conscious of mine as a friend with her own blind needs, her own mute sorrows, her loud joys.

673
00:42:57,060 --> 00:43:00,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Her love of some fragrances and loathing of certain smells.

674
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:03,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Her ears that welcome all music.

675
00:43:03,462 --> 00:43:07,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Her eyes that see beyond facades, but forget to see the facade itself.

676
00:43:08,904 --> 00:43:11,765
[SPEAKER_02]: She is the entity who shares my other consciousness.

677
00:43:12,145 --> 00:43:16,606
[SPEAKER_02]: When she is out of sorts, but I'm sanguine, we confuse each other.

678
00:43:17,046 --> 00:43:18,847
[SPEAKER_02]: But sometimes it's the other way around.

679
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:21,548
[SPEAKER_02]: But mostly we keep peace between us.

680
00:43:22,368 --> 00:43:26,609
[SPEAKER_02]: She keeps track of time, so that even when I'm not near a clock, she lets me know.

681
00:43:27,209 --> 00:43:31,391
[SPEAKER_02]: When I'm hurt, she forces me to shut down my other self and attend to her.

682
00:43:31,931 --> 00:43:33,151
[SPEAKER_02]: This is as it should be.

683
00:43:33,791 --> 00:43:38,833
[SPEAKER_02]: She has given me space to live within her, and I love her, and I thank her for giving me room.

684
00:43:39,553 --> 00:43:44,394
[SPEAKER_02]: She is a map of my journeys, and the road on which the journeys took place.

685
00:43:44,954 --> 00:43:49,295
[SPEAKER_02]: And her imperfections, so many, fill me with quiet affection.

686
00:43:51,116 --> 00:43:51,236
[SPEAKER_02]: And...

687
00:43:53,143 --> 00:44:06,571
[SPEAKER_02]: She has shed her skin so many times and donned new ones, and her hands, all veined, have held this earth and other hands with love and trust, ready to give, even when she lost sometimes.

688
00:44:07,211 --> 00:44:11,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, she has failed me at times, but then I failed her even more.

689
00:44:11,854 --> 00:44:13,314
[SPEAKER_02]: But mostly, we are at peace.

690
00:44:14,055 --> 00:44:15,576
[SPEAKER_02]: I shall miss her when she dies.

691
00:44:16,196 --> 00:44:19,698
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not think she'll remember to miss me at the time of her passing.

692
00:44:20,385 --> 00:44:20,845
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, wow.

693
00:44:21,406 --> 00:44:25,088
[SPEAKER_08]: Fantastic.

694
00:44:25,889 --> 00:44:27,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.

695
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:28,791
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't lie.

696
00:44:29,231 --> 00:44:30,552
[SPEAKER_08]: She's wonderfully lyrical.

697
00:44:31,532 --> 00:44:33,354
[SPEAKER_08]: She has a vivid imagination.

698
00:44:33,494 --> 00:44:38,337
[SPEAKER_08]: And she knows her internal rhythms really, really well.

699
00:44:38,357 --> 00:44:39,478
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you read another one for us?

700
00:44:39,578 --> 00:44:39,818
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

701
00:44:39,878 --> 00:44:40,478
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

702
00:44:40,498 --> 00:44:42,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

703
00:44:48,826 --> 00:45:04,849
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was when I was reading about children in cages in detention centers and it was really hard and you feel so impotent with rage and you can't do anything to help because what are you going to do?

704
00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:08,351
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we don't have the power to go in and fix anything.

705
00:45:08,391 --> 00:45:14,252
[SPEAKER_02]: All we can do is give money to the organizations that do, that are able to get their lawyers in and do all of that work.

706
00:45:14,952 --> 00:45:17,033
[SPEAKER_02]: But I thought I'd write a poem about it.

707
00:45:17,573 --> 00:45:18,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the Thing is the title.

708
00:45:19,973 --> 00:45:27,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the thing about children in detention centers, abandoned, sick, dying, separated from all that is good.

709
00:45:28,422 --> 00:45:29,964
[SPEAKER_02]: One cannot make poetry from it.

710
00:45:30,865 --> 00:45:32,226
[SPEAKER_02]: One cannot make art from it.

711
00:45:32,867 --> 00:45:36,410
[SPEAKER_02]: One cannot make anything from it, for it is unimaginable.

712
00:45:37,411 --> 00:45:39,513
[SPEAKER_02]: It is an offense against humanity.

713
00:45:39,874 --> 00:45:41,816
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes all other emotion hollow.

714
00:45:42,376 --> 00:45:44,879
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes it hard to live a life that holds meaning.

715
00:45:46,241 --> 00:45:49,723
[SPEAKER_02]: All joys and sadnesses become muted when set against it.

716
00:45:50,324 --> 00:45:55,027
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet we struggle on, stupid, stupefied, stunned by it all.

717
00:45:55,648 --> 00:45:59,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Still laugh, still eat and drink, still find pleasure in daily things.

718
00:46:00,871 --> 00:46:04,314
[SPEAKER_02]: For if only sorrow and horror define us, what's left?

719
00:46:05,314 --> 00:46:11,716
[SPEAKER_02]: So we make music and art and we sing even when our voices crack and other cracks form within.

720
00:46:12,476 --> 00:46:28,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Dual consciousness is the new burden all of us carry as we try and carve out a different vision for all people, perhaps a different life, and work in what ways we can to tilt the balance a little in favor of humanity.

721
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:34,462
[SPEAKER_02]: And if the horror we see doesn't kill us all, the work we do might just save us all.

722
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:35,880
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

723
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:36,201
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

724
00:46:36,721 --> 00:46:37,221
[SPEAKER_07]: Hear, hear.

725
00:46:38,022 --> 00:46:38,562
[SPEAKER_07]: Hear, hear.

726
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:39,563
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

727
00:46:40,664 --> 00:46:41,165
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good.

728
00:46:41,245 --> 00:46:45,368
[SPEAKER_08]: So I want to make sure I give you the last word.

729
00:46:45,388 --> 00:46:45,808
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

730
00:46:46,429 --> 00:46:47,590
[SPEAKER_08]: When you're parting shots.

731
00:46:47,830 --> 00:46:48,791
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

732
00:46:49,091 --> 00:46:49,751
[SPEAKER_02]: From here or?

733
00:46:50,854 --> 00:46:52,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Just from your soul.

734
00:46:52,835 --> 00:46:53,816
[SPEAKER_02]: From my soul.

735
00:46:53,836 --> 00:47:02,362
[SPEAKER_02]: I say, my message to everyone is find beauty everywhere you look.

736
00:47:03,082 --> 00:47:06,464
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know people say this, and we say this, that does not make it untrue.

737
00:47:06,544 --> 00:47:08,606
[SPEAKER_02]: If you hear it a thousand times, it's still true.

738
00:47:09,266 --> 00:47:10,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Find the beauty everywhere.

739
00:47:11,688 --> 00:47:13,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Find empathy for suffering.

740
00:47:16,391 --> 00:47:19,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Try and find joy in days when joy is lacking.

741
00:47:22,529 --> 00:47:23,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Become the thing you look at.

742
00:47:23,709 --> 00:47:25,590
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at a flower, become that flower.

743
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:27,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Absorb its color.

744
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:28,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Let it become you.

745
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:30,851
[SPEAKER_02]: For a second, you are it.

746
00:47:31,751 --> 00:47:32,831
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really lovely.

747
00:47:33,751 --> 00:47:35,652
[SPEAKER_02]: And likewise, you look at an animal.

748
00:47:35,692 --> 00:47:40,552
[SPEAKER_02]: The animal is so pure, so true, like Walt Whitman said, I think I shall turn and live with animals.

749
00:47:40,592 --> 00:47:42,253
[SPEAKER_02]: They are so quiet and self-contained.

750
00:47:42,993 --> 00:47:44,193
[SPEAKER_02]: They do not complain, et cetera.

751
00:47:44,253 --> 00:47:45,533
[SPEAKER_02]: I forget the rest of what he said.

752
00:47:45,933 --> 00:47:48,494
[SPEAKER_02]: But I love the quiet and self-contained nature of things.

753
00:47:50,414 --> 00:47:57,298
[SPEAKER_02]: So sometimes, when human beings become too much for us, become a thing, or an animal, or a bird, or a flower.

754
00:47:57,418 --> 00:47:57,858
[SPEAKER_02]: It helps.

755
00:47:58,819 --> 00:48:07,163
[SPEAKER_02]: And just be as true to yourself as you can, as well as not lose sight of actual

756
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:09,914
[SPEAKER_02]: objective truth.

757
00:48:10,475 --> 00:48:11,175
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know what I mean?

758
00:48:11,756 --> 00:48:13,818
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to understand truth and truth.

759
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:15,379
[SPEAKER_02]: They're two different truths.

760
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:19,083
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I'm sounding very philosophical, so I shall stop.

761
00:48:19,644 --> 00:48:21,165
[SPEAKER_02]: But thank you so much for listening.

762
00:48:21,185 --> 00:48:21,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

763
00:48:21,846 --> 00:48:22,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

764
00:48:22,366 --> 00:48:24,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Ladies and gentlemen, Vijaya Sundaram.

765
00:48:24,288 --> 00:48:24,649
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

766
00:48:26,829 --> 00:48:27,470
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Terry.

767
00:48:27,590 --> 00:48:27,990
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

768
00:48:28,190 --> 00:48:37,598
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much for bringing new perspective and your great talents to the arts community in Greater Medford.

769
00:48:38,379 --> 00:48:45,164
[SPEAKER_08]: It's important work that you'll be engaged in, and I hope that the city will treat you at least as well as they've treated me.

770
00:48:46,005 --> 00:48:51,067
[SPEAKER_08]: And to everyone watching, thanks so much for your attentiveness and interest in our discussion.

771
00:48:51,668 --> 00:48:55,269
[SPEAKER_08]: Get ready for something very special on the musical side of the coin.

772
00:48:55,789 --> 00:49:05,534
[SPEAKER_08]: We're gonna take a little bit of a break to reset our stage, and I'll share some announcements, and then we'll get started with the music for the evening.

773
00:49:05,794 --> 00:49:06,954
[SPEAKER_08]: So, all right?

774
00:49:07,495 --> 00:49:07,815
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

775
00:49:08,155 --> 00:49:08,855
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Vijay.

776
00:49:08,935 --> 00:49:10,176
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, thank you very much.

777
00:49:10,356 --> 00:49:10,696
[SPEAKER_08]: Lovely.

778
00:49:20,061 --> 00:49:21,682
[SPEAKER_02]: just because, I hope that's okay.

779
00:49:22,842 --> 00:49:24,042
[SPEAKER_02]: You have copies of your books?

780
00:49:24,282 --> 00:49:24,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yes, I have.

781
00:49:24,863 --> 00:49:26,183
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yes, yes, yes.

782
00:49:26,523 --> 00:49:37,886
[SPEAKER_08]: So the book is called Fractured Lens, okay, retails $16, and if you'd like it, Vijaya has them available so that you can purchase it.

783
00:49:37,906 --> 00:49:38,907
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

784
00:49:39,047 --> 00:49:39,547
[SPEAKER_08]: You're welcome.

785
00:49:47,022 --> 00:49:53,146
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me just make sure I've got all of my ducks in a row paper-wise.

786
00:49:53,567 --> 00:49:53,907
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

787
00:49:54,567 --> 00:49:55,548
[SPEAKER_08]: All good?

788
00:49:56,068 --> 00:49:57,449
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

789
00:49:57,489 --> 00:49:58,010
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good.

790
00:49:58,070 --> 00:49:58,630
[SPEAKER_08]: Good, good.

791
00:49:58,790 --> 00:49:59,150
[SPEAKER_08]: All set.

792
00:50:18,749 --> 00:50:22,231
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that under the table?

793
00:50:22,291 --> 00:50:24,092
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

794
00:52:40,254 --> 00:52:40,734
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

795
00:52:40,814 --> 00:52:43,276
[SPEAKER_00]: And then which mic is this third mic?

796
00:52:43,376 --> 00:52:45,097
[SPEAKER_00]: This third mic is for the mic.

797
00:52:45,177 --> 00:52:45,697
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's cool.

798
00:52:45,717 --> 00:52:48,659
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to bring that one out.

799
00:52:48,779 --> 00:52:50,700
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it was at 12 o'clock.

800
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:50,940
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

801
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:51,120
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.

802
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:51,260
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

803
00:52:51,281 --> 00:52:52,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.

804
00:52:52,181 --> 00:52:55,383
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you need more gain, just let me know, and I'll come adjust it.

805
00:52:55,403 --> 00:52:55,783
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

806
00:52:55,803 --> 00:52:56,323
[SPEAKER_00]: I can let you know.

807
00:52:56,544 --> 00:52:56,884
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

808
00:52:57,004 --> 00:52:57,764
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah.

809
00:52:57,784 --> 00:52:58,525
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's hers.

810
00:52:58,885 --> 00:53:01,026
[SPEAKER_00]: So now is this kind of like here?

811
00:53:01,086 --> 00:53:01,386
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

812
00:53:01,706 --> 00:53:01,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

813
00:53:02,547 --> 00:53:03,728
[SPEAKER_03]: This is cool.

814
00:53:03,888 --> 00:53:05,229
[SPEAKER_03]: This is like the right way.

815
00:53:06,049 --> 00:53:09,091
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that mic picking up the guitar in addition to her?

816
00:53:09,591 --> 00:53:11,433
[SPEAKER_00]: do you want to be plugged in?

817
00:53:11,633 --> 00:53:13,335
[SPEAKER_00]: yes I'll be plugged in

818
00:53:37,441 --> 00:53:41,992
I mean, he was picking them up.

819
00:53:56,459 --> 00:53:56,739
th th

820
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:18,682
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want me to try and grab an XLR and take a feed out of the end?

821
00:54:18,842 --> 00:54:22,623
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you want to just stick with it as it is for now?

822
00:54:22,683 --> 00:54:24,124
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it'll be OK.

823
00:54:24,304 --> 00:54:25,924
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, we'll be OK the way it is?

824
00:54:25,944 --> 00:54:27,485
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds good.

825
00:54:27,505 --> 00:54:28,686
[SPEAKER_08]: She's mic'd up, so.

826
00:54:34,328 --> 00:54:37,289
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, folks, we're going to keep it moving.

827
00:54:39,670 --> 00:54:40,090
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

828
00:54:41,291 --> 00:54:42,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep her moving.

829
00:54:42,311 --> 00:54:42,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

830
00:54:45,942 --> 00:54:46,282
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

831
00:54:50,586 --> 00:54:51,907
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good, very good.

832
00:54:54,689 --> 00:54:55,129
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

833
00:54:58,452 --> 00:54:59,073
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all right.

834
00:54:59,253 --> 00:55:00,654
[SPEAKER_08]: Commerce, blind commerce.

835
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:01,134
[SPEAKER_08]: I love it.

836
00:55:01,795 --> 00:55:02,195
[SPEAKER_08]: I love it.

837
00:55:02,876 --> 00:55:05,458
[SPEAKER_08]: If it wasn't you, it would be me, so don't worry about it.

838
00:55:07,099 --> 00:55:10,201
[SPEAKER_08]: I got books in the trunk of my car, just like I told you.

839
00:55:13,044 --> 00:55:13,204
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

840
00:55:14,826 --> 00:55:28,944
[SPEAKER_08]: So, first of all, I want to, and you know, some of you might be in the audience and some of you might be watching out there on TV land and so forth, but thanks to everyone who joined us for the recent two-day Medford Jazz Festival.

841
00:55:30,005 --> 00:55:36,931
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a great, albeit hot, time on both days, and the music was really, really wonderful.

842
00:55:37,031 --> 00:55:47,339
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was a real, I think it was a real feather in the capital community center to be able to stage a two-day jazz festival again in our own backyard.

843
00:55:47,419 --> 00:55:50,161
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just want to say thank you for everybody who came out.

844
00:55:51,062 --> 00:55:59,664
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so elders, join us each week, Tuesday through Thursday, for a nutritious lunch and vibrant fellowship.

845
00:55:59,744 --> 00:56:01,364
[SPEAKER_08]: Lunch is served at 12 noon.

846
00:56:01,724 --> 00:56:08,906
[SPEAKER_08]: You can call 781-483-3042 to make a reservation with either myself or with Lisa.

847
00:56:10,326 --> 00:56:14,847
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you feel like you have history with this organization,

848
00:56:15,547 --> 00:56:26,510
[SPEAKER_08]: and want to show special love or support, please consider purchasing a commemorative brick to be placed under our front portico here at WMCC.

849
00:56:27,390 --> 00:56:39,754
[SPEAKER_08]: This is actually the second iteration of the Brick by Brick fundraising campaign, and we're excited to offer a new group of friends and neighbors the opportunity to participate.

850
00:56:40,234 --> 00:56:47,276
[SPEAKER_08]: see me or Lisa or actually any board member to get a form, fill it out, write a check.

851
00:56:47,776 --> 00:56:50,617
[SPEAKER_08]: Placements are limited, so don't delay.

852
00:56:50,697 --> 00:56:57,259
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you want to see what it looks like, right as you go out the front door to the left, there's one pad.

853
00:56:57,579 --> 00:57:02,540
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to actually excavate another pad, and we're going to have about 70 more bricks that can go in.

854
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:05,421
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you want to get a brick, climb on board.

855
00:57:06,241 --> 00:57:16,270
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, join us here at the WMCC in membership, and don't forget to attend our annual meeting at 2 p.m.

856
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:19,492
[SPEAKER_08]: on Sunday, September 17th.

857
00:57:19,973 --> 00:57:31,182
[SPEAKER_08]: New and returning board members will be voted upon by the active membership, and a progress report on the organizational health and direction of the WMCC will be shared.

858
00:57:32,103 --> 00:57:40,126
[SPEAKER_08]: The new school year is upon us, and we have open slots in our after-school youth program for middle schoolers who are Medford residents.

859
00:57:40,926 --> 00:57:45,347
[SPEAKER_08]: Please contact Lisa Crossman for details or to enroll new students.

860
00:57:46,327 --> 00:57:46,708
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay?

861
00:57:47,108 --> 00:57:48,508
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so how can you help us?

862
00:57:48,868 --> 00:57:53,870
[SPEAKER_08]: Your tax-deductible donations help to support the mission of WMCC.

863
00:57:54,330 --> 00:57:56,771
[SPEAKER_08]: Partner with us in carrying this mission forward.

864
00:57:57,171 --> 00:57:57,911
[SPEAKER_08]: Please consider

865
00:58:02,159 --> 00:58:06,443
[SPEAKER_08]: making a tax-deductible donation to this vital community organization.

866
00:58:06,824 --> 00:58:10,127
[SPEAKER_08]: You can make your donation by phone, online, or by check.

867
00:58:10,227 --> 00:58:18,115
[SPEAKER_08]: Please contact Lisa at 781-483-3042 for more information or to become a member.

868
00:58:19,176 --> 00:58:21,439
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, folks, enough for commercials.

869
00:58:21,519 --> 00:58:23,621
[SPEAKER_08]: Now it's time to turn

870
00:58:24,822 --> 00:58:31,206
[SPEAKER_08]: our attention to the lyrical miracle we've engaged for this evening's musical side of The Ledger.

871
00:58:31,967 --> 00:58:44,915
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so tonight we're gonna go with two well-established and highly professional performers that have gained considerable followings and have also taken their wonderful talents beyond Massachusetts and New England.

872
00:58:44,955 --> 00:58:50,179
[SPEAKER_08]: It gives me great pleasure to introduce Erin Hogan and Ike Sturm.

873
00:58:51,059 --> 00:58:53,421
[SPEAKER_08]: I met Erin, oh please, yes, yes.

874
00:58:53,801 --> 00:58:55,162
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely good time to clap.

875
00:58:56,383 --> 00:59:10,212
[SPEAKER_08]: I met Erin a few years ago when we both joined our good friend Jonathan Fagan, convener of the Jazz Festival, Fagan, to present a program of poetry and song to a senior residential community in Newton.

876
00:59:11,073 --> 00:59:14,435
[SPEAKER_08]: Erin began the program and I was really, really impressed.

877
00:59:14,455 --> 00:59:16,516
[SPEAKER_08]: She has a remarkable voice.

878
00:59:16,596 --> 00:59:20,379
[SPEAKER_08]: About halfway through my poetry, I got heckled.

879
00:59:21,499 --> 00:59:24,041
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the seniors shouted, bring the singer back.

880
00:59:25,662 --> 00:59:28,583
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's what we did, you know.

881
00:59:29,424 --> 00:59:37,669
[SPEAKER_08]: Erin's extensive training includes heavy influences in classical music, opera, jazz, folk, and the great American songbook.

882
00:59:38,149 --> 00:59:41,511
[SPEAKER_08]: Her amazing voice works beautifully in all these genres.

883
00:59:42,011 --> 00:59:43,332
[SPEAKER_08]: She is from the Midwest.

884
00:59:44,406 --> 00:59:45,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, from Wisconsin.

885
00:59:45,527 --> 00:59:46,629
[SPEAKER_08]: Wisconsin, yes.

886
00:59:47,109 --> 00:59:51,154
[SPEAKER_08]: And she is bringing her artistry to the WMCC for the first time.

887
00:59:51,634 --> 00:59:58,102
[SPEAKER_08]: She is a vocalist with an amazing repertoire and a broad musical vocabulary, as you will soon see and hear.

888
00:59:58,182 --> 00:59:59,784
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome to West Medford, Erin Hogan.

889
01:00:00,865 --> 01:00:01,205
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

890
01:00:01,225 --> 01:00:01,285
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

891
01:00:02,266 --> 01:00:13,839
[SPEAKER_08]: So, no less accomplished and highly sought after as a musician, a songwriter, composer, and arranger, let me also present Aaron's accompanist, bassist Ike Stern.

892
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:21,067
[SPEAKER_08]: Like Aaron, he is also from the Midwest, hailing originally from a musical home in Wisconsin.

893
01:00:22,669 --> 01:00:28,293
[SPEAKER_08]: His first teacher was his dad, a renowned composer and arranger by the name of Fred Sturm.

894
01:00:28,974 --> 01:00:34,978
[SPEAKER_08]: Ike has performed with luminaries like Bobby McFerrin, band leader Maria Schneider, and Kenny Wheeler.

895
01:00:35,018 --> 01:00:45,867
[SPEAKER_08]: He has played on four Down Beat award-winning recordings and alongside numerous creative ensembles in New York where he spends most of his time these days.

896
01:00:46,127 --> 01:00:55,890
[SPEAKER_08]: Ike also studied jazz and classical bass and composition while earning undergraduate and graduate degrees at the renowned Eastman School of Music.

897
01:00:56,350 --> 01:01:01,792
[SPEAKER_08]: Ladies and gentlemen, please give a warm West Medford welcome to Erin Hogan and Ike Stern.

898
01:01:02,732 --> 01:01:04,532
[SPEAKER_08]: The floor is yours.

899
01:01:08,393 --> 01:01:11,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Whenever I hear that I play with Bobby McFerrin, I'm like, whoa.

900
01:01:11,954 --> 01:01:12,235
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

901
01:01:14,854 --> 01:01:15,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Super lucky.

902
01:01:17,015 --> 01:01:17,935
[SPEAKER_03]: So excited to be here.

903
01:01:17,975 --> 01:01:20,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Terry, for the warm welcome.

904
01:01:20,856 --> 01:01:22,216
[SPEAKER_03]: And everyone, beautiful.

905
01:01:22,316 --> 01:01:24,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for your offering.

906
01:01:24,217 --> 01:01:27,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm super excited to play.

907
01:01:27,518 --> 01:01:31,739
[SPEAKER_03]: The first song I like to play is called Pretty Saro.

908
01:01:31,759 --> 01:01:33,900
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an American folk song.

909
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:42,583
[SPEAKER_03]: But we kind of take our own little journey with it, inspired by jazz and all my different musical influences.

910
01:01:44,844 --> 01:01:49,929
[SPEAKER_03]: I moved to Boston from Chicago where I was doing my undergrad.

911
01:01:49,969 --> 01:01:53,693
[SPEAKER_03]: I just graduated from Boston University doing opera.

912
01:01:53,833 --> 01:02:00,280
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, but I'm ready to take my own kind of journey with music and I'm really happy to share this with you all.

913
01:02:35,219 --> 01:02:54,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Down in some lone valley, in some lonesome place, where the wild birds do whistle, the notes do increase.

914
01:02:56,745 --> 01:02:58,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Farewell, pretty sorrow.

915
01:03:01,931 --> 01:03:20,662
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll bid you adieu And I'll dream of pretty Sarah Wherever I go Oh

916
01:03:40,078 --> 01:04:08,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I love pretty Sarah But I understand She wants a freeholder But I have no land I cannot maintain her On silver or gold

917
01:04:11,812 --> 01:04:18,859
[SPEAKER_04]: nor buy all the fine things that a big house can hold.

918
01:04:19,099 --> 01:04:19,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

919
01:04:43,627 --> 01:05:12,547
[SPEAKER_04]: If I were a merchant and could write a fine hand I'd write my love a letter that she'd understand But I'll wander by the river where the waters overflow

920
01:05:15,783 --> 01:05:23,487
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll dream a pretty sorrow wherever I go.

921
01:05:26,389 --> 01:05:37,354
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll dream a pretty sorrow wherever I go, wherever I go.

922
01:05:47,266 --> 01:05:47,847
Thank you.

923
01:06:14,346 --> 01:06:14,826
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

924
01:06:14,846 --> 01:06:16,027
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so fun.

925
01:06:16,047 --> 01:06:16,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

926
01:06:18,468 --> 01:06:28,113
[SPEAKER_03]: The next song I'd like to do, I'm really inspired lately by English folk music and Irish folk music.

927
01:06:28,133 --> 01:06:29,534
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been listening a lot to that.

928
01:06:29,574 --> 01:06:36,438
[SPEAKER_03]: I did some work with the Silk Road Ensemble last month in August, and it's really, that time is...

929
01:06:38,539 --> 01:06:42,320
[SPEAKER_03]: asked me to reflect on my own heritage and my own influences too.

930
01:06:42,380 --> 01:06:47,701
[SPEAKER_03]: I've studied jazz, I've studied opera, I've studied, and I haven't really studied folk music.

931
01:06:47,741 --> 01:06:53,682
[SPEAKER_03]: It's only something that I've listened to and so I'm really happy to play these pieces by one of my favorite singers.

932
01:06:54,442 --> 01:07:00,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Her name is Sandy Denny and she is just, I would say, I can't stop listening to her.

933
01:07:00,404 --> 01:07:01,204
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty obsessed.

934
01:07:02,464 --> 01:07:06,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Next to like Joni Mitchell, I think she's like one of my favorite singers and someone that I draw

935
01:07:07,325 --> 01:07:08,726
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of inspiration from.

936
01:07:10,607 --> 01:07:16,250
[SPEAKER_03]: And so these are two songs that are, I think, really special to me and I don't think are done enough.

937
01:07:17,270 --> 01:07:26,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, some of my favorite opera singers have done this first song, Who Knows Where the Time Goes, on some of their albums, so I can even hear the classical influences in this music.

938
01:07:26,695 --> 01:07:28,756
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I hope you enjoy.

939
01:08:02,628 --> 01:08:06,209
[SPEAKER_04]: across the morning sky.

940
01:08:09,630 --> 01:08:24,394
[SPEAKER_04]: All the birds are leaving, but how can they know that it's time for them to go?

941
01:08:31,889 --> 01:08:49,548
[SPEAKER_04]: the winter fire I will still be dreaming I do not count the time

942
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:55,763
[SPEAKER_04]: For who knows where the time goes?

943
01:08:57,024 --> 01:09:03,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows where the time goes?

944
01:09:07,091 --> 01:09:08,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

945
01:09:10,333 --> 01:09:11,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Sad, deserted shore.

946
01:09:13,996 --> 01:09:15,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Your fickle friend.

947
01:09:21,940 --> 01:09:32,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, but then you know that it's time for them to go.

948
01:09:33,988 --> 01:09:39,731
[SPEAKER_04]: But I will still be here.

949
01:09:39,751 --> 01:09:45,855
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no thought of leaving.

950
01:09:52,620 --> 01:10:04,269
[SPEAKER_04]: do not fear the time for who knows where the time goes who knows where

951
01:10:43,786 --> 01:10:45,187
[SPEAKER_04]: For I am not alone.

952
01:10:49,532 --> 01:11:05,749
[SPEAKER_04]: While my love is near me, I know it will be so until it's time for them to go.

953
01:11:10,931 --> 01:11:30,038
[SPEAKER_04]: come storms of winter and then the birds in spring again.

954
01:11:32,479 --> 01:11:34,920
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no fear of time.

955
01:11:40,795 --> 01:11:59,090
[SPEAKER_04]: my love grows who knows where the time goes who knows where the time goes

956
01:12:22,613 --> 01:12:24,295
Thank you.

957
01:12:25,135 --> 01:12:27,197
Do I ever wonder?

958
01:12:27,237 --> 01:12:29,618
You don't know.

959
01:12:46,224 --> 01:12:51,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you ever follow and I'll never show?

960
01:12:55,689 --> 01:13:04,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you see the water and watch it flow and float an empty shell?

961
01:13:08,314 --> 01:13:11,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that I'm hiding?

962
01:13:20,891 --> 01:13:26,175
[SPEAKER_04]: You've a fault in your senses.

963
01:13:27,456 --> 01:13:34,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you feel it now?

964
01:13:38,765 --> 01:13:45,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Time, what is that of no time?

965
01:13:51,030 --> 01:13:56,875
[SPEAKER_04]: I've lived for a long while nearly everywhere.

966
01:14:01,058 --> 01:14:09,985
[SPEAKER_04]: You will be taken, everyone, you ladies and gentlemen.

967
01:14:14,910 --> 01:14:22,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on, listen with your ear upon the paving stone.

968
01:14:26,296 --> 01:14:35,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that what you hear, the calming of the sea?

969
01:14:44,213 --> 01:15:02,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Sea flows under your doors in London town And all your defenses are all broken down

970
01:15:06,445 --> 01:15:21,962
[SPEAKER_04]: you laugh at me on funny days but mine's the sleight of hand don't you know that i'm a joker

971
01:15:31,481 --> 01:15:52,312
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting for the land

972
01:16:23,737 --> 01:16:31,911
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah super super so happy to be here with you all that's that was called the sea by sandy denny i love that song so much

973
01:16:33,365 --> 01:16:37,348
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm super happy Ike's here to offer his amazing talents.

974
01:16:38,249 --> 01:16:40,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the next song I'd like to do is actually one of Ike's.

975
01:16:41,611 --> 01:16:42,732
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so beautiful.

976
01:16:42,772 --> 01:16:43,792
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called Connection.

977
01:16:43,813 --> 01:16:45,894
[SPEAKER_03]: And he wrote this in 2020.

978
01:16:46,114 --> 01:16:54,720
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you wanted to say a little bit about your piece, Ike, you'll quickly realize why it's like one of my favorite songs.

979
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:54,960
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.

980
01:16:54,980 --> 01:16:55,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

981
01:16:55,241 --> 01:16:59,484
[SPEAKER_03]: So nice to be here with you guys tonight.

982
01:16:59,584 --> 01:17:00,244
[SPEAKER_00]: What a beautiful

983
01:17:01,886 --> 01:17:12,309
[SPEAKER_00]: space, this building, we got to walk upstairs and just get just a very early glimpse of like how unique and special and uplifting this place is.

984
01:17:12,349 --> 01:17:14,989
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just really inspired being here.

985
01:17:15,309 --> 01:17:30,173
[SPEAKER_00]: And this piece, I really, I was thinking about getting to play this piece in this space because I guess after a few years ago, when I heard the news about children being separated at the Mexican border from their

986
01:17:39,636 --> 01:17:40,079
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

987
01:17:40,099 --> 01:17:41,769
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, hello.

988
01:17:45,717 --> 01:17:46,798
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much, Kevin.

989
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:58,708
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a few years ago, when I heard this news about children being separated from their families, it hit me so hard and I didn't, it's one of those helpless feelings where you don't want something to happen and you don't quite know what to do.

990
01:17:59,429 --> 01:18:05,974
[SPEAKER_00]: And in my little sphere of influence, what I could do was sort of write my thoughts down and make some music.

991
01:18:06,234 --> 01:18:12,219
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were able to share this at a church where I worked in New York City, a place they called the Jazz Church, called St.

992
01:18:12,259 --> 01:18:12,620
[SPEAKER_00]: Peter's.

993
01:18:14,341 --> 01:18:17,183
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were getting to play this piece at that time.

994
01:18:17,243 --> 01:18:22,287
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually kind of put some other feelings into it, too, because I have two kids myself that are 14 and 18.

995
01:18:23,308 --> 01:18:27,210
[SPEAKER_00]: Just took one of them to college, unbelievably, a few days ago.

996
01:18:27,230 --> 01:18:28,672
[SPEAKER_00]: So my head's spinning a little bit.

997
01:18:28,972 --> 01:18:39,179
[SPEAKER_00]: But this tune was written for them and also for the child that we all kind of find within ourselves, too, kind of digging back into our pasts and our childhoods.

998
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:42,304
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I tried, I don't usually write words.

999
01:18:42,344 --> 01:18:45,470
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually write, you know, write chords in music.

1000
01:18:45,890 --> 01:18:50,639
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this was something that I tried to write the text for as well.

1001
01:18:50,999 --> 01:18:52,362
[SPEAKER_00]: And this tune's called Connection.

1002
01:18:52,382 --> 01:18:53,364
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope you enjoy.

1003
01:19:10,619 --> 01:19:16,782
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to be in tune to be able to connect, right?

1004
01:19:16,802 --> 01:19:19,203
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a friend that's a great jazz guitarist named Gene Perkinsini.

1005
01:19:19,943 --> 01:19:21,324
[SPEAKER_00]: He's in his 80s now.

1006
01:19:21,364 --> 01:19:21,904
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, sir.

1007
01:19:21,924 --> 01:19:22,184
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.

1008
01:19:23,965 --> 01:19:26,946
[SPEAKER_00]: This makes such a scene every time I try to say something.

1009
01:19:27,847 --> 01:19:29,027
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I should not say anything.

1010
01:19:29,047 --> 01:19:29,808
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good hint.

1011
01:19:30,808 --> 01:19:32,549
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but I have a wonderful friend, Gene.

1012
01:19:32,609 --> 01:19:36,891
[SPEAKER_00]: And he always says, every time you're tuning your instrument, he goes, man, how long have you known about this gig?

1013
01:19:39,744 --> 01:19:41,165
[SPEAKER_03]: How long have I known about this gig?

1014
01:19:44,346 --> 01:19:47,027
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to spare you all from this mic.

1015
01:19:47,047 --> 01:19:48,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Write out the case.

1016
01:20:17,970 --> 01:20:18,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1017
01:21:18,770 --> 01:21:21,073
[SPEAKER_04]: A child is born.

1018
01:21:22,735 --> 01:21:25,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Their bond is torn.

1019
01:21:26,779 --> 01:21:32,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we be free as infants weep?

1020
01:21:36,078 --> 01:21:42,761
[SPEAKER_04]: They forget her face, their first embrace.

1021
01:21:44,282 --> 01:21:51,985
[SPEAKER_04]: We won't stand by as children cry.

1022
01:21:52,565 --> 01:22:00,789
[SPEAKER_04]: You are beautiful, my child, just as you are.

1023
01:22:04,133 --> 01:22:21,522
[SPEAKER_04]: I see you standing there with a heart that yearns in you, burns in me.

1024
01:22:22,982 --> 01:22:24,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Lean on me.

1025
01:22:26,806 --> 01:22:33,870
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll always be by my side.

1026
01:22:34,931 --> 01:22:43,355
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be your guide.

1027
01:22:45,897 --> 01:22:47,638
[SPEAKER_04]: La, do, da, do, da, do.

01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:21,646
[SPEAKER_04]: You are beautiful, my child, just as you are.

1029
01:23:25,109 --> 01:23:42,261
[SPEAKER_04]: I see you standing there with a heart that yearns in you, burns in me.

1030
01:23:43,842 --> 01:23:46,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Mercy flows.

1031
01:23:47,784 --> 01:23:49,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Connections grow.

1032
01:23:52,003 --> 01:23:54,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Break the wall.

1033
01:23:55,785 --> 01:23:59,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Divisions fall.

1034
01:24:01,448 --> 01:24:07,951
[SPEAKER_04]: A love like ours is in the stars.

1035
01:24:09,512 --> 01:24:16,215
[SPEAKER_04]: It's what we need to live and breathe.

1036
01:24:17,728 --> 01:24:22,750
[SPEAKER_04]: You are beautiful, my child.

1037
01:24:24,350 --> 01:24:33,073
[SPEAKER_04]: You, you are beautiful, my child.

[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

01:25:48,110 --> 01:25:49,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Super, super excited to be here.

[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm going to bring back, I actually think I'm going to do both sides now by Joni Mitchell.

1045
01:25:59,737 --> 01:26:01,698
[SPEAKER_03]: She's also one of my favorite, favorite writers.

1046
01:26:02,859 --> 01:26:06,741
[SPEAKER_03]: And are you going to play upright or are you going to play up?

1047
01:26:06,921 --> 01:26:07,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1048
01:26:07,381 --> 01:26:07,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

[SPEAKER_03]: A. Yeah.

1052
01:26:25,744 --> 01:26:26,925
[SPEAKER_03]: We just got together today.

1053
01:26:26,945 --> 01:26:31,869
[SPEAKER_03]: We're like, today, like, yeah, we have no time to rehearse, you know, because we live far apart.

1054
01:26:35,712 --> 01:26:38,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Or G, G. Yeah.

1055
01:26:50,472 --> 01:26:53,214
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the ages old game of tuning.

1056
01:26:53,234 --> 01:27:05,542
[SPEAKER_03]: How y'all feeling?

1057
01:27:05,582 --> 01:27:05,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Good?

1058
01:27:05,922 --> 01:27:06,862
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Friday night.

1059
01:27:06,922 --> 01:27:07,643
[SPEAKER_03]: This is great.

1060
01:27:07,703 --> 01:27:08,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Great end of the week.

1061
01:27:10,905 --> 01:27:11,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1062
01:27:24,019 --> 01:27:26,320
[SPEAKER_03]: I think of these songs kind of like prayers, too.

1063
01:27:26,340 --> 01:27:45,047
[SPEAKER_03]: A big part of my music making starts in the church, and these songs, I love how this song can change through all the years that, from when you first heard it to like now, and it's like, it's a timeless song, and that's what I love about this.

1064
01:27:50,990 --> 01:28:10,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Rows and flows of angel hair And ice cream castles in the air And feather canyons everywhere I've looked at clouds that way

1065
01:28:12,540 --> 01:28:16,381
[SPEAKER_04]: But now they only block the sun.

1066
01:28:18,002 --> 01:28:23,083
[SPEAKER_04]: They rain and snow on everyone.

1067
01:28:24,003 --> 01:28:32,446
[SPEAKER_04]: So many things I would have done, but clouds got in my way.

1068
01:28:36,377 --> 01:28:52,030
[SPEAKER_04]: I've looked at clouds from both sides now, from up and down, and still somehow it's clouds, illusions.

1069
01:28:53,551 --> 01:28:55,153
[SPEAKER_04]: I recall.

1070
01:28:55,173 --> 01:28:59,837
[SPEAKER_04]: I really don't know love.

1071
01:29:10,185 --> 01:29:28,975
[SPEAKER_04]: moons and dunes and ferris wheels the dizzy dancing way you feel as every fairy tale comes real i've looked at love that way

1072
01:29:31,755 --> 01:29:35,737
[SPEAKER_04]: And now it's just another show.

1073
01:29:36,897 --> 01:29:41,019
[SPEAKER_04]: You leave them laughing when you go.

1074
01:29:41,819 --> 01:29:45,961
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you care, don't let them know.

1075
01:29:47,002 --> 01:29:49,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't give yourself away.

1076
01:29:51,824 --> 01:29:56,446
[SPEAKER_04]: I've looked at love from both sides now.

1077
01:29:57,887 --> 01:30:05,252
[SPEAKER_04]: From give and take and still somehow.

1078
01:30:06,213 --> 01:30:11,997
[SPEAKER_04]: It's love's illusions I recall.

1079
01:30:12,017 --> 01:30:22,244
[SPEAKER_04]: I really don't know love at all.

1080
01:30:24,526 --> 01:30:24,886
[SPEAKER_04]: At all.

1081
01:30:30,385 --> 01:30:41,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Tears and fears and feeling proud to say I love you right out loud.

1082
01:30:41,649 --> 01:30:47,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Dreams and schemes and circus crowds.

1083
01:30:48,412 --> 01:30:50,733
[SPEAKER_04]: I've looked at life that way.

1084
01:30:52,870 --> 01:30:57,532
[SPEAKER_04]: But now old friends, they're acting strange.

1085
01:30:58,372 --> 01:31:00,233
[SPEAKER_04]: They shake their heads.

1086
01:31:00,733 --> 01:31:04,315
[SPEAKER_04]: They say I've changed.

1087
01:31:04,855 --> 01:31:13,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, something's lost and something's gained in living every day.

1088
01:31:16,778 --> 01:31:35,648
[SPEAKER_04]: I've looked at life from both sides now, from win and lose, and still somehow it's life's illusions I recall.

1089
01:31:35,668 --> 01:31:38,469
[SPEAKER_04]: I really don't know.

1090
01:31:44,039 --> 01:31:46,386
[SPEAKER_04]: I really don't know a lot.

1091
01:32:39,761 --> 01:32:44,183
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like every time I play these songs it's like a new time.

1092
01:32:46,846 --> 01:32:48,207
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't feel my hands.

1093
01:32:48,387 --> 01:32:53,091
[SPEAKER_03]: I was playing so hard on the bass.

1094
01:32:53,532 --> 01:32:55,653
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to do the first song I ever learned.

1095
01:32:55,673 --> 01:32:57,495
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called Moon River.

1096
01:32:58,936 --> 01:33:00,618
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of my favorite songs ever.

1097
01:33:00,638 --> 01:33:06,923
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is also probably like the first time we've ever played it.

1098
01:33:06,963 --> 01:33:09,885
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like every time I sing this song, it's like the first time I've ever sung it.

1099
01:33:11,526 --> 01:33:30,793
[SPEAKER_03]: I have this woman in my life she's like my second mother and her name is Anita and we I used to go over to her house I'm a triplet I grew up in Wisconsin that's how I know I connected through his father who was an incredible music teacher of all my music teachers growing up which is like crazy

1100
01:33:32,834 --> 01:33:37,057
[SPEAKER_03]: But where I was going with this, this is my first music teacher, my neighbor, her name is Anita.

1101
01:33:37,478 --> 01:33:46,945
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have to mention her every time I sing this song because she used to sit, I used to sit next to her at the piano and she used to play this and we'd sing it together.

1102
01:33:46,985 --> 01:33:49,107
[SPEAKER_03]: And she was the one that taught me how to sing.

1103
01:33:49,928 --> 01:33:52,690
[SPEAKER_03]: And she, she calls me Erinita.

1104
01:33:52,710 --> 01:34:00,556
[SPEAKER_03]: And because she, she always wanted a girl and she has two boys who are like similar in age to my brothers.

1105
01:34:00,616 --> 01:34:01,237
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a triplet.

1106
01:34:02,037 --> 01:34:04,279
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we would trade.

1107
01:34:04,359 --> 01:34:07,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Her boys would go over to our house, and I would go over to her house.

1108
01:34:07,721 --> 01:34:10,123
[SPEAKER_03]: And she is amazing.

1109
01:34:10,944 --> 01:34:11,444
[SPEAKER_03]: I pray for her.

1110
01:34:11,524 --> 01:34:13,205
[SPEAKER_03]: She's struggling with cancer.

1111
01:34:13,246 --> 01:34:17,589
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you can really just keep her in your thoughts and prayers.

1112
01:34:17,609 --> 01:34:21,752
[SPEAKER_03]: And every time I sing this song, I think it's like a prayer to her.

1113
01:34:22,132 --> 01:34:23,353
[SPEAKER_03]: And she's amazing.

1114
01:34:23,413 --> 01:34:24,894
[SPEAKER_03]: She's from India.

1115
01:34:24,954 --> 01:34:26,856
[SPEAKER_03]: And I learned a lot of my...

1116
01:34:28,797 --> 01:34:32,738
[SPEAKER_03]: like spirituality and the way that I just live from her.

1117
01:34:32,818 --> 01:34:34,879
[SPEAKER_03]: So I dedicate this to Anita.

1118
01:34:34,939 --> 01:34:37,080
[SPEAKER_03]: She's the most beautiful person ever.

1119
01:34:37,400 --> 01:34:38,120
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.

1120
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:39,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm getting like choked up about her.

1121
01:34:40,061 --> 01:34:40,221
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1122
01:35:11,687 --> 01:35:25,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Moon river wider than a mile I'm crossing you in style someday

[SPEAKER_04]: Oh dream maker, you heart breaker, wherever you're going, I'm going your way.

01:36:03,119 --> 01:36:12,282
[SPEAKER_04]: We're after the same rainbow's end.

1127
01:36:14,183 --> 01:36:15,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Waiting round the bend.

[SPEAKER_04]: my huckleberry friend moon river and me do it one more time moon river

[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1137
01:38:36,353 --> 01:38:36,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

1138
01:38:37,133 --> 01:38:39,834
[SPEAKER_03]: That's also one of my grandpa's favorite song, too.

1139
01:38:40,555 --> 01:38:41,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he loved that.

1140
01:38:41,355 --> 01:38:43,856
[SPEAKER_03]: He loved how you sang that for him.

1141
01:38:44,537 --> 01:38:44,857
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1142
01:38:49,359 --> 01:38:50,299
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good for silence.

1143
01:38:50,900 --> 01:38:52,000
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm choking on my own water.

1144
01:38:52,721 --> 01:38:53,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, guys.

1145
01:39:00,304 --> 01:39:01,685
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to do a song I wrote.

1146
01:39:04,721 --> 01:39:05,702
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called I Don't Know.

1147
01:39:05,722 --> 01:39:10,467
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what it's called, literally, which is funny.

1148
01:39:10,487 --> 01:39:10,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1149
01:39:15,566 --> 01:39:25,251
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wrote this actually because I've been really inspired by, I'll speak into the mic, Thich Nhat Hanh, who's one of my favorite teachers.

1150
01:39:26,191 --> 01:39:32,775
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't know Thich Nhat Hanh, he is a Zen Buddhist master.

1151
01:39:32,875 --> 01:39:33,975
[SPEAKER_03]: He's so amazing.

1152
01:39:35,076 --> 01:39:37,017
[SPEAKER_03]: My favorite book of his, he has many books.

1153
01:39:38,298 --> 01:39:39,479
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say hundreds of books.

1154
01:39:40,399 --> 01:39:42,520
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's an amazing poet.

1155
01:39:43,460 --> 01:39:44,360
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's an amazing teacher.

1156
01:39:44,380 --> 01:39:46,661
[SPEAKER_03]: And he passed away last February.

1157
01:39:46,681 --> 01:39:50,383
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's February 2022, or maybe January.

1158
01:39:52,683 --> 01:39:58,806
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wrote this song because I was really inspired by his teachings about the present moment.

1159
01:40:00,807 --> 01:40:04,488
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to tune a little bit more, because I realize that it's a little humid outside.

1160
01:40:11,542 --> 01:40:13,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Our instruments have to get in the present.

1161
01:40:13,203 --> 01:40:15,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's like, ah.

1162
01:40:21,587 --> 01:40:23,889
[SPEAKER_03]: And living in the present moment is hard.

1163
01:40:23,949 --> 01:40:27,090
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of the central practices of Buddhism.

1164
01:40:27,250 --> 01:40:30,592
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's also one of the lessons you keep learning over and over again.

1165
01:40:31,092 --> 01:40:33,814
[SPEAKER_03]: There's this podcast called The Way Out Is In.

1166
01:40:33,854 --> 01:40:35,575
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the Plum Village podcast.

1167
01:40:36,155 --> 01:40:39,357
[SPEAKER_03]: And Plum Village is the monastery that Thich Nhat Hanh

1168
01:40:41,478 --> 01:40:52,223
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in France, and I think now he has a monastery in Thailand, and there's a Deer Park Monastery in upstate New York, and there's many monasteries now.

1169
01:40:57,646 --> 01:41:18,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, like one of his attendants, his name is Brother Fapu, he was here, actually I got to meet him, Brother Fapu, he's like my, he's like a Buddhist celebrity to me, he's just an amazing teacher, he was Thich Nhat Hanh's, and he would like probably hate that I said that, but he's an amazing young Buddhist practitioner, a Buddhist teacher, and attendant to Thich Nhat Hanh for quite a while.

1170
01:41:19,368 --> 01:41:31,353
[SPEAKER_03]: And I came here to Harvard to open up the Chan School of Public Health, or open up a Thich Nhat Hanh, I think, research on meditation at Harvard.

1171
01:41:31,473 --> 01:41:33,194
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said that,

1172
01:41:36,835 --> 01:41:39,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Thich Nhat Hanh always had to practice mindful walking.

1173
01:41:39,177 --> 01:41:45,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's this thing, the practice of just mindful walking is just like taking, being aware of each step.

1174
01:41:46,384 --> 01:41:54,651
[SPEAKER_03]: And we always walk, you know, because we want to get somewhere, but the practice for Thich Nhat Hanh is just walking to walk, walking with no destination.

1175
01:41:54,671 --> 01:41:55,512
[SPEAKER_03]: And so,

1176
01:41:57,854 --> 01:42:00,078
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think that that inspired the song too.

1177
01:42:00,740 --> 01:42:02,062
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like a little mantra.

1178
01:42:02,323 --> 01:42:04,967
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've heard of mantra singing, it's something that I'm really into.

1179
01:42:04,987 --> 01:42:08,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's like a, it's like a mantra.

1180
01:42:43,928 --> 01:42:46,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Let go of the future or the past.

1181
01:42:47,049 --> 01:42:49,949
[SPEAKER_04]: The present moment's all we ever have.

1182
01:42:56,070 --> 01:42:58,231
[SPEAKER_04]: The clarity in letting go.

1183
01:42:59,031 --> 01:43:05,392
[SPEAKER_04]: The certainty in I don't really know.

1184
01:43:09,453 --> 01:43:10,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Guide me.

1185
01:43:15,535 --> 01:43:28,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Help me, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

1186
01:43:43,857 --> 01:43:49,783
[SPEAKER_04]: The magic of discovering what heals our suffering.

1187
01:43:49,803 --> 01:44:02,975
[SPEAKER_04]: And each of us a light that shines that we live a life to realize.

1188
01:44:12,226 --> 01:44:13,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Teresa!

1189
01:44:45,640 --> 01:44:48,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Let go of the future, of the past.

1190
01:44:48,701 --> 01:44:53,803
[SPEAKER_04]: The present moment's all we ever have.

1191
01:44:57,504 --> 01:44:59,605
[SPEAKER_04]: The clarity in letting go.

1192
01:44:59,625 --> 01:45:06,288
[SPEAKER_04]: The certainty in I don't really know.

1193
01:45:09,089 --> 01:45:11,190
[SPEAKER_04]: The clarity in letting go.

1194
01:45:11,210 --> 01:45:14,611
[SPEAKER_04]: The certainty in I don't really know.

1195
01:45:28,470 --> 01:45:32,073
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we have about one more song, one more song.

1196
01:45:32,473 --> 01:45:40,778
[SPEAKER_03]: And this last one, I'm wondering, curious if you guys would like to join me in singing if we sung a little bit together.

1197
01:45:40,798 --> 01:45:45,681
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll teach you this phrase.

1198
01:45:50,294 --> 01:45:50,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah.

1199
01:45:52,055 --> 01:45:55,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Will you go, lassie, go.

[SPEAKER_03]: We'll sing it one more time together.

1213
01:47:27,998 --> 01:47:33,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Wonderful.

1214
01:48:00,065 --> 01:48:19,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the summer time has come, and the trees are sweetly blooming, and the wild mountain time rolls around the blooming heather.

Thank you so much.

[SPEAKER_07]: Jack Teck.

1232
01:52:13,290 --> 01:52:14,791
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, all right.

1233
01:52:17,572 --> 01:52:18,352
[SPEAKER_07]: Erin Hogan.

1234
01:52:20,173 --> 01:52:20,914
[SPEAKER_07]: Ike Sturm.

1235
01:52:25,035 --> 01:52:29,057
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much once again for coming out and joining us tonight.

1236
01:52:29,517 --> 01:52:34,400
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for Jaya Sundaram for sitting down and having a conversation with me.

1237
01:52:35,540 --> 01:52:39,262
[SPEAKER_08]: Just appreciate these nights that we have together because

1238
01:52:39,862 --> 01:52:41,344
[SPEAKER_08]: They're few and far between.

1239
01:52:41,405 --> 01:52:45,350
[SPEAKER_08]: We only do it once a month, and some months we don't get to do it at all.

1240
01:52:45,390 --> 01:52:50,177
[SPEAKER_08]: But when we do, it's really, really a glorious time that we have together.

1241
01:52:50,597 --> 01:52:53,421
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to thank my friend back there, Kevin Harrington.

1242
01:52:56,036 --> 01:53:01,222
[SPEAKER_08]: unassisted tonight, so, you know, he's a solo hockey player, right?

1243
01:53:01,282 --> 01:53:02,564
[SPEAKER_08]: He shoots, he scores.

1244
01:53:03,685 --> 01:53:13,858
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to thank Executive Director Lisa Crossman for really, really being the wind beneath the wings of this program.

1245
01:53:14,778 --> 01:53:28,305
[SPEAKER_08]: for saying, yeah, I like this, this is good, we gotta keep on doing this, and going out and finding the resources to allow us to do it, so thanks everybody who's come out tonight.

1246
01:53:28,846 --> 01:53:39,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Think about the Buy a Brick campaign, 70 spaces, it's really, really a special initiative of the community center, we'd love to have as many people represented

1247
01:53:39,631 --> 01:53:45,436
[SPEAKER_08]: as we possibly can, folks who have history with the community center, folks who have love for the West Medford community.

1248
01:53:45,476 --> 01:53:55,803
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a real way to tangibly demonstrate that, you know, you are part of the heritage of this wonderful community that we're losing bit by bit.

1249
01:53:55,884 --> 01:54:02,729
[SPEAKER_08]: So having the Brick by Brick campaign allows us to retain bits and pieces of that heritage and that history.

1250
01:54:03,929 --> 01:54:05,210
[SPEAKER_08]: Continue to support us.

1251
01:54:05,770 --> 01:54:07,051
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell your friends about us.

1252
01:54:07,511 --> 01:54:17,917
[SPEAKER_08]: Next month, let's have twice as many people in the room, twice as many people at home listening, watching on 47 and 3 and the live stream on YouTube.

1253
01:54:18,357 --> 01:54:20,078
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been a wonderful evening.

1254
01:54:20,138 --> 01:54:22,119
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to take a few pictures up here.

1255
01:54:22,740 --> 01:54:25,641
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know, you folks can hang out with us.

1256
01:54:26,902 --> 01:54:32,125
[SPEAKER_08]: But as we used to say at the end of the party, you ain't got to go home, but you got to get the heck up out of here.

1257
01:54:33,026 --> 01:54:34,329
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1258
01:54:34,389 --> 01:54:34,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Love you all.

1259
01:54:34,851 --> 01:54:35,813
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you all very much.
