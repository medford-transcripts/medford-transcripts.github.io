    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=0.81s">Vijaya</a>  Sundaram is a native of northern India who has been a resident.</p>

    <p>[Sundaram]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=5.655s">Southern</a>  India.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=6.375s">Southern</a>  India. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=7.536s">You</a>  know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=8.037s">I</a>  just knew I couldn't go the whole night without blowing something. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=10.82s">OK,</a>  very good. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=12.181s">Southern</a>  India, who has been a resident of Medford for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=16.645s">She</a>  lives in Medford's other west, that is Felsway West. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=22.391s">She</a>  is a truly creative spirit. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=24.713s">Vijay</a>  is an accomplished poet and what I call a literary lioness. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=30.878s">She</a>  is also a songwriter, a singer, and an adjunct professor, no, an assistant professor in the English and Humanities Department at Bunker Hill Community College. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=41.788s">She</a>  has been a traditional classroom and homeschooling elementary grades teacher, as well as a poetry and literature professor. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=49.634s">Her</a>  written work has appeared in publications like the Rising Phoenix Press and the Stardust Review. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=55.919s">And</a>  just a few weeks ago, her first full collection of poetry called Fractured Lens, very good, was released by Somerville-Sylvania Barber Press. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=74.284s">I</a>  have known Vijaya for a little over two years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=77.826s">We've</a>  worked together on a few occasions, and I've been blessed by our association and allyship. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=84.929s">She</a>  is a poet of great power and clarity. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=88.331s">There</a>  is substance, style, and depth to her writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=91.952s">She</a>  is a progressive thinker and understands social injustice, prejudice, and systemic inequity from both a personal and intellectual perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=102.918s">In</a>  many ways, we are kindred spirits. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=106.202s">It's</a>  my honor and my pleasure to bring my good friend and poetry peer Vijaya Sundaram to First Fridays at the West Medford Community Center.</p>

    <p>[Sundaram]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=115.493s">Thank</a>  you so much, Terry.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=116.875s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=117.456s">You're</a>  welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=117.977s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=118.497s">You're</a>  welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=121.058s">So</a>  I'm going to let you run in just a second, because I'm only going to get this one more time. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=127.843s">So</a>  as I participated in your recent inauguration, I had the opportunity to present a new poem extending words of welcome and speaking to the transition. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=139.071s">So</a>  as is my custom in hosting these evenings, I'd like to share a piece of verse. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=144.234s">And</a>  this was that poem, and it's called The Refreshing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=151.388s">We</a>  keep it fresh, my friends, not because the first thing wasn't a good thing, a timely thing, an honorable thing, even a historic thing, but because the next thing matters too. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=163.713s">It</a>  extends equity. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=165.434s">It</a>  doubles down on diversity. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=167.595s">It</a>  infests in inclusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=169.356s">It</a>  creates a rising tide that lifts our mystic ships yet again. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=174.998s">Our</a>  new embrace is warm and substantial, even as our goodbye is sober and heartfelt. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=181.3s">We</a>  haven't lost. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=182.701s">We've</a>  learned. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=183.941s">And</a>  that is ripe fruit for renewal and restoration and revolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=190.143s">Inaugurations</a>  and installations are both splendid invitations for a good thing, a timely thing, an honorable thing, even a historic thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=200.567s">So</a>  have no lamentations in this place. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=203.589s">Our</a>  task is both noble and necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=206.671s">We</a>  rejoice in what we came to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=208.993s">We</a>  resound in what we came to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=211.634s">We</a>  refresh in what we came to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=214.736s">We</a>  release in what we came to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=217.797s">If</a>  one holds the torch too long, the oil of his anointing will burn close and at caution. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=224.06s">Wisdom</a>  reproaches and advises, do not let darkness beckon. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=228.962s">Light</a>  a new candle and pass it on. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=232.104s">The</a>  centurion awaits her in ordination. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=235.785s">The</a>  sentinel watches at the ramparts. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=237.906s">The</a>  vanguard prepares to approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=240.267s">The</a>  next herald must have her say. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=243.869s">The</a>  same sun shines equally on antiquity and perpetuity. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=248.312s">Let</a>  the old inform the new, even as the midnight sky informs the morning dew at the break of dawn. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=255.335s">Let</a>  what was become what is and is to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=260.259s">So</a>  let's keep it fresh, my friends, because while the first thing was a good thing, a timely thing, an honorable thing, even a historic thing, the next thing matters too. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=271.583s">Let</a>  it extend equity. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=273.984s">Let</a>  it double down on diversity. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=276.385s">Let</a>  it invest in inclusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=278.726s">Let</a>  it create a rising tide that lifts our ancient ships yet again for Vijaya.</p>

    <p>[Sundaram]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=286.934s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=287.935s">What</a>  a beautiful poem. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=289.095s">I'm</a>  going to have to clap.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=290.156s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=294.137s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=294.678s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=295.718s">So</a>  that's the lay of the land. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=298.339s">So</a>  let's have a friendly chat with my old friend and your new friend Vijaya Sundaram. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=305.403s">So</a>  Vijaya, can you talk a bit about your early journey to the US as an immigrant from India? <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=312.546s">What</a>  brought you here and why did you stay?</p>

    <p>[Sundaram]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=315.689s">Oh,</a>  well, that would lead me to include my husband, Warren, who very kindly showed up and gave me my glasses when I needed them. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=324.052s">I</a>  completely forgot I needed them. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=325.893s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=326.934s">I</a>  had to signal to him. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=328.374s">So</a>  I met Warren in 1986 in the city of Pune. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=332.816s">I</a>  had just arrived in Pune in 1985 from the south of India. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=337.038s">He</a>  had just arrived in 1985 from Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=340.499s">on</a>  a scholarship to study Indian classical music. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=342.8s">I</a>  was at Ferguson College studying my masters in literature, and he was there hosting musicians in his house. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=350.562s">So</a>  through a series of interesting events, I ended up at his place, not knowing it was his place. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=356.344s">We</a>  met each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=357.464s">We</a>  became instant friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=360.385s">We</a>  talked. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=360.986s">We</a>  played music. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=361.706s">We</a>  sang. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=362.466s">Two</a>  years later, we got married, and I came here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=365.507s">Wow.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=366.308s">That</a>  was it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=367.728s">We</a>  thought that we'd be here for a short while, but his father said, nope, we're going to arrange for a green card for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=375.292s">So</a>  he did. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=376.453s">And</a>  I thought, OK, brief while. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=378.714s">And</a>  then the time flew by. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=380.735s">And</a>  then I said, OK, fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=381.956s">It</a>  looks like I'm going to live here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=384.177s">So</a>  I became a citizen in 1999. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=387.839s">What</a>  brought me here is really getting married to Warren Sanders, a musician and a band leader and writer and educator himself. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=396.583s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=397.184s">Fantastic.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=398.464s">Fantastic.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=399.225s">And</a>  clearly, the same thing that brought you here is the thing that keeps you here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=403.067s">Yes,</a>  indeed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=404.207s">Really</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=405.448s">Really</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=409.637s">differences,</a>  whether it's cultural, sociological, environmental, between where you were and where you are.</p>

    <p>[Sundaram]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=420.742s">So</a>  when I was in the city of Madras, which is now Chennai, and Pune, which is now Pune, things obviously weren't as automated as they are now. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=432.387s">And</a>  so the differences there were that people would <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=438.635s">The</a>  body language is different. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=440.196s">Facial</a>  expressions are different. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=442.076s">You</a>  speak English, but it's not the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=444.837s">It's</a>  not that we spoke a different grammar. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=447.658s">It's</a>  that we spoke a different culture of English. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=450.399s">It's</a>  hard to explain until you've lived in two places for any length of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=454.74s">If</a>  you just go and visit, it's not the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=458.142s">People</a>  will make allowances for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=459.982s">But</a>  if you live there and then you live here, <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=462.563s">you</a>  learn that your facial expression and your body language change imperceptibly. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=469.232s">The</a>  way you walk, the way you carry yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=471.435s">So</a>  in the city of Pune, men didn't look at women directly unless you were equals in college or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=478.163s">You'd</a>  sort of look. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=479.545s">sort</a>  of respectfully sideways, maybe not directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=484.909s">So</a>  that's one of the differences. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=486.19s">So</a>  I remembered feeling annoyed when I went back and people didn't look at me directly because I'd gotten used to it over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=493.435s">So</a>  another thing that I had gotten used to, well there's so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=499.56s">I</a>  remember when I spoke over here and <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=504.243s">gestured,</a>  people didn't understand me. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=506.565s">And</a>  I thought, surely I'm making sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=508.826s">I'm</a>  speaking grammatical English, and I speak and enunciate clearly. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=513.068s">So</a>  what is it that they're missing? <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=514.409s">What</a>  is it that I'm missing? <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=516.11s">And</a>  I think they were primed to misunderstand me, and I was primed to not understand that they didn't understand me. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=523.595s">Do</a>  you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=524.315s">I</a>  think I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=526.236s">It's</a>  really hard to explain, but I remember <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=529.718s">thinking</a>  I was very clear and someone misunderstood what I was saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=533.901s">And</a>  it is, it's almost like when they hear your name, for example, you write your name, Vijaya, they imagine that it's something else. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=542.347s">It's</a>  exactly as it's written. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=545.229s">But</a>  because mentally you're thinking it's a foreign thing, you are sort of not noticing what it really is. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=554.915s">Again,</a>  it's very imperceptible. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=556.676s">When</a>  I went back to Pune the first time, <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=559.598s">All</a>  the shopkeepers said, where are you from? <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=561.521s">I</a>  said, I'm from here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=563.163s">They</a>  said, no, you're not from here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=565.786s">Where</a>  are you from? <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=566.908s">So</a>  both ways, everything changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=569.191s">And</a>  it's impossible to put it into words. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=572.315s">All</a>  I know is you stand differently if you're in America. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=576.941s">You</a>  talk differently, you are more direct. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=579.723s">In</a>  India, they are direct, they are very direct, but it's different eye contact. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=586.951s">That's</a>  just one of the things, and then of course everything else is too big a thing to go into. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=591.916s">It's</a>  a cultural thing, it's a different talk entirely.</p>

    <p>[Sundaram]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=600.937s">In</a>  India, people show up unannounced. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=603.419s">So</a>  the doorbell rings and it's your friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=605.901s">It's</a>  a neighbor. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=607.282s">And</a>  you're not supposed to get annoyed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=609.404s">So</a>  I got annoyed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=610.285s">After</a>  I'd lived here for a while, I went back and said, why don't you call me? <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=613.788s">I'm</a>  not ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=614.669s">I'm</a>  not dressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=615.489s">Forget</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=618.452s">It's</a>  very sweet. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=619.272s">It's</a>  one of the nice aspects of India. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=621.554s">People</a>  come. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=622.134s">There's</a>  fluid movement between homes and houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=626.757s">People</a>  show up, and they're there for you in a way. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=632.392s">It's</a>  not that obvious here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=633.974s">I'm</a>  not saying they're not here for you, but it's too far-flung. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=637.518s">The</a>  communities are too disparate. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=639.72s">But</a>  in India, my mother and my aunt live alone now in a flat. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=644.045s">My</a>  grandmother died, my father died, my grandfather died. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=646.587s">Two</a>  older women living alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=649.671s">And</a>  they're very brave. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=652.052s">In</a>  India, it's always the man who protects you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=655.553s">Over</a>  here, too, actually, but people deny it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=658.894s">I'm</a>  talking about the mindset. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=662.096s">But</a>  here, it's much more independent. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=664.977s">There,</a>  the women are becoming more independent. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=668.738s">I</a>  miss the coming and going of people over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=672.619s">I</a>  miss the crowds on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=674.68s">I</a>  could ride my bicycle late at night and never be afraid. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=679.221s">I</a>  would ride from Deccan Gymkhana, where I would have done a recording for the Indian Institute, the Film Institute of India, with Warren. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=688.344s">He</a>  was staying there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=689.045s">And</a>  then I'd ride my bike home, and it would be midnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=693.346s">And</a>  people would be going, not just men, but men and women and children going for a midnight snack for the local restaurant or something. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=702.736s">It</a>  was really charming, so I miss that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=705.659s">When</a>  I first came here, I thought, where are all the people? <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=708.542s">There's</a>  no one. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=709.502s">You</a>  go out on the street at 8 o'clock and you're saying, <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=712.609s">I'm</a>  afraid, you know, that was the first year after that I got used to it.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=715.591s">There</a>  are a lot of communities where they roll up the sidewalks at 10, you know, where I live in Randolph now, yeah, they pretty much roll up the sidewalks at 10 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=726.078s">I</a>  like that, I like how you said it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=729.56s">You</a>  homeschooled your daughter? <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=730.981s">Yes,</a>  indeed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=731.421s">Okay,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=732.582s">Did</a>  you ever say, what the heck have I gotten myself into? <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=737.105s">How</a>  is it different from teaching a group of young people in a traditional classroom?</p>

    <p>[Sundaram]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=741.32s">So</a>  I have the advantage of having taught in public school. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=745.122s">I</a>  taught for 17 years in Winchester as an eighth grade English teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=749.865s">I</a>  saw what the pressure was on the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=752.186s">I</a>  inadvertently added to that pressure, even though I did my best not to, and they appreciated it a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=758.449s">You</a>  still have to because there are expectations. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=760.51s">There's</a>  homework, there's tests, there's things you need to prepare them for. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=764.352s">The</a>  parents are, you know, I need my child to get into Harvard or whatever, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=768.634s">So</a>  you have to, <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=769.855s">deliver</a>  without killing their spirit. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=773.076s">And</a>  I did my utmost. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=775.477s">I</a>  worked like a dog. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=777.018s">Okay,</a>  dogs don't work, but I worked very hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=779.879s">I</a>  worked to make sure that I provided a safe and happy place for the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=784.381s">There</a>  would be music playing, but still, I saw what their pressure was. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=788.343s">When</a>  they came into the classroom, I'd have a free ride when they came in. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=791.044s">There'd</a>  be a prompt on the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=792.484s">There'd</a>  be some guitar music. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=794.185s">and</a>  there'd be plants hanging from the walls, from the ceiling, pictures, no motivational pictures, just pictures of art. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=802.792s">And</a>  so that was nice, but not everybody had that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=807.116s">And</a>  I'm not blaming anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=809.858s">We</a>  need to deliver, and public schools are great. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=814.061s">And</a>  I love being a public school teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=816.123s">I</a>  still think that we need them. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=818.905s">People</a>  think it's either or. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=821.287s">It's</a>  never either or. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=823.889s">I</a>  loved being, and I would have continued being, a public school teacher had I not gotten burned out from giving 100%, 200%, if that's possible, every time. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=834.936s">But</a>  I was getting older and tired, so I left that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=839.278s">But</a>  I saw that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=840.239s">And</a>  so when people in my public school asked me, why are you homeschooling your daughter? <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=847.206s">I</a>  said, there's room in the world for all kinds of people, and there's room in the world for all kinds of schooling. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=853.707s">There's</a>  public school, there are private schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=855.708s">No</a>  one questions the private schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=858.208s">Why</a>  are they even there? <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=859.729s">And</a>  then the charter schools, they take, you know, some... Bits of both. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=863.489s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=863.869s">And</a>  then, so I said, there's room for all of us, and there's room, and if you can do it, why not? <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=868.65s">And</a>  look, I'm reducing the pressure on public schools by homeschooling. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=872.611s">So</a>  my arguments were very logical, and they couldn't really say anything against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=877.012s">But</a>  I didn't plan to homeschool her. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=880.353s">It</a>  was my husband who came up with the idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=882.073s">And</a>  I said, I've been in school my whole life. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=885.994s">I</a>  love school. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=886.734s">What</a>  do you mean homeschool? <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=888.155s">And</a>  he said, no, let's give it a try. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=891.036s">And</a>  it worked. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=891.956s">It</a>  worked because we are both teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=894.936s">And</a>  we know what needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=897.237s">If</a>  we don't know a subject, we know how to approach not knowing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=901.57s">But</a>  even those who are not teachers will tell you that homeschooling worked for their children. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=906.314s">It</a>  depends on how involved you are and how much you love learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=913.1s">And</a>  I had students in my public school who said, you're homeschooling your daughter? <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=916.483s">I</a>  wish I were homeschooled. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=918.405s">And</a>  I said, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=920.887s">That</a>  mindset was already there in them. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=923.329s">It</a>  doesn't matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=924.17s">I</a>  think schools can sometimes reduce the incentive to learn, and it's no shame on, I mean, it's the way the system is. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=933.377s">And</a>  I have nothing against, I mean, we're trying to do the best we can for everybody, and not everyone has the advantage of being homeschooled. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=941.544s">And</a>  I love the public schools because they give lunch, breakfast, <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=945.247s">They</a>  had the kids who didn't have, I had some students who didn't have that at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=949.79s">And</a>  they would come and have their free lunch or breakfast. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=952.652s">They</a>  had access to guidance Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=955.574s">They</a>  had access to psychologists. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=957.976s">I</a>  was so grateful for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=959.717s">There</a>  are some things in homeschooling <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=962.62s">which</a>  could be improved. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=964.462s">No</a>  one really checks on you, you could be doing anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=967.625s">So</a>  there are some good things and bad things about both. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=969.888s">Have</a>  I covered everything?</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=972.611s">Well,</a>  I have a sense that the accountability piece wasn't a big deal for you.</p>

    <p>[Sundaram]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=977.316s">Not</a>  for us, but it could be. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=978.217s">I</a>  don't think you needed folks checking on you.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=980.32s">Okay,</a>  very good, very good. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=982.262s">So</a>  talk a little bit about your work at Bunker Hill.</p>

    <p>[Sundaram]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=985.743s">So</a>  after four years of intense homeschooling, so we were homeschooling while I was a public school teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=992.946s">I'd</a>  come home after teaching for six hours, spending time with my students after school and coming home, and I'd read six chapters at a time of a book for my daughter. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1001.809s">I</a>  would leave assignments for her. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1004.75s">She</a>  was not good at handwriting. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1006.031s">She's</a>  a great mind and wonderful speller and a great thinker. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1009.374s">But</a>  her handwriting was still, you know, awkward like mine is still. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1013.117s">So</a>  I would leave these little dotted things for her to write over when she was very little and then she got better. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1020.122s">I</a>  would teach her some math, Warren would teach her more math and music and woodworking and Indian and Western music. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1028.206s">So</a>  she learned guitar growing up and classical Indian music and we enrolled her in Indian dance class and swimming. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1037.331s">So</a>  all of that, so after four years of doing intensive that and nothing else, I began to feel the itch of wanting to teach in a public setting. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1047.773s">So</a>  I found, someone said, you should apply to Bunker Hill Community College. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1053.214s">And</a>  I said, but don't you need a PhD? <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1054.775s">And</a>  they said, no, not always. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1056.835s">So</a>  I applied, and I went through the interview process, and that was as an adjunct in 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1061.896s">Then</a>  they had an opening. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1063.677s">I</a>  applied and interviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1065.897s">And</a>  they gave me the job last semester, last fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1069.241s">So</a>  this is my second full year at Bunker Hill now. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1072.124s">I</a>  love it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1072.845s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1073.506s">And</a>  I love teaching those students. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1075.067s">They're</a>  fantastic.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1076.449s">So</a>  what surprises you most about the work that you do in teaching now, your students and such?</p>

    <p>[Sundaram]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1084.008s">Well,</a>  when I first entered the college, and Bunker Hill is quite a sprawling place, I knew very little about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1091.737s">I</a>  frankly didn't know anything about community colleges, shame on me, but I didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1096.442s">And</a>  I learned rapidly. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1098.344s">And</a>  the first sense was that I have entered the United Nations. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1102.608s">I</a>  loved being there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1104.89s">So</a>  many brown faces, so many Africans from Africa, so many African-Americans, so many Spanish speakers, so many people from various countries, from Eastern Europe, from India, from Pakistan, Bangladesh. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1118.018s">I</a>  loved it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1120.3s">China</a>  and some Japanese students and some Vietnamese students. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1124.443s">So</a>  I had students from everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1128.545s">They</a>  came with different strengths, and it was lovely to teach them. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1133.371s">They</a>  were there to learn. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1134.472s">The</a>  difference between teaching children, and again, no offense, children are beautiful to teach, and grown-ups is that <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1143.41s">The</a>  grown-ups are there because they want to learn. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1145.771s">And</a>  the children are there because they're made to go to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1147.912s">Let's</a>  face it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1149.112s">They'd</a>  rather be outside playing, and who can blame them? <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1152.694s">But</a>  I love teaching these students. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1156.195s">And</a>  it was hard because there was a multiplicity of educational systems to which they had been differently exposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1164.938s">And</a>  so I had to figure out how to make it <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1168.96s">equitable</a>  for all without dumbing down the syllabus and making it inspiring. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1174.604s">So</a>  they had to read William Zinsser, or Kurt Vonnegut, or Virginia Woolf, or James Baldwin, who is very hard for even English speakers to read. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1185.851s">He</a>  is such an intellectual giant. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1188.092s">I</a>  made sure we read Maya Angelou, we read people from various places, Sandra Cisneros, some Indian writers as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1198.039s">I</a>  wanted to represent the multiplicity of voices. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1202.725s">to</a>  represent in class for them to relate to at different levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1208.868s">And</a>  I said, look, you may not understand the language. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1211.23s">I</a>  will read all of the words and all of the sentences. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1214.371s">I</a>  recorded hours of this stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1216.833s">I</a>  said, look, I will read, I will stop, I will explain each sentence if it's difficult, every word. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1223.196s">And</a>  they really liked it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1224.197s">Wow.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1224.757s">They</a>  were willing to go with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1226.218s">How</a>  beautiful. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1227.299s">That's</a>  a lot of work, but I liked it a lot.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1230.3s">So</a>  you went through, obviously, the heart of the COVID-19 scourge, and it's changed the way that we behave in general, but how did it change the way that you approached collegiate teaching?</p>

    <p>[Sundaram]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1251.776s">I</a>  had to teach a lot online. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1254.498s">And</a>  that was a rapid learning for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1257.66s">I</a>  went from not knowing anything about learning management systems to learning it as fast as possible and using every possibility it offered. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1266.126s">That</a>  was great. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1266.706s">I</a>  like learning new things. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1268.187s">It</a>  doesn't matter what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1270.109s">So</a>  that was fun for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1271.85s">And</a>  I learned how to use all of the technological stuff available. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1275.693s">And</a>  they gave us some training, but I also poked around and figured out some stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1280.496s">And</a>  so most of the classes were online, but then they began to have them in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1286.841s">And</a>  so that was nice, to have both.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1289.343s">So</a>  I'm going to shift gears a little bit, and I wanted to ask you, what made you decide to apply for the Poet Laureate's Opportunity in Medford?</p>

    <p>[Sundaram]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1301.454s">I</a>  actually knew nothing about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1303.495s">A</a>  friend of mine, which is not actually a friend, an acquaintance, whose children took my poetry club. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1309.517s">I</a>  teach homeschoolers online. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1311.558s">I</a>  call it Poetry Club. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1312.559s">And</a>  they come. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1313.439s">I</a>  have children from various towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1316.16s">And</a>  so her children were in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1317.761s">She</a>  lives in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1318.701s">And</a>  she said, you know, this thing is being advertised. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1321.682s">You</a>  should apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1323.243s">My</a>  children rave about you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1325.004s">I</a>  said, because I wasn't reading the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1327.785s">I</a>  was too busy teaching.</p>

    <p>[RhUNhYl62Oo_SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1329.006s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Sundaram]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1329.727s">So</a>  I didn't see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1330.927s">And</a>  they said, you should apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1331.988s">I</a>  said, OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1333.348s">So</a>  the first time I applied, but I didn't get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1337.27s">Terry</a>  got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1339.191s">This</a>  is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1339.932s">I</a>  was so happy you got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1341.533s">I</a>  did not feel bad at all, not one whit. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1344.614s">So</a>  just letting you know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1345.755s">OK,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1346.435s">The</a>  second time. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1347.896s">I</a>  was just so pleased that it was there, that they chose a worthy person for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1355.218s">And</a>  a delightful, worthy, and wonderful poet. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1358.299s">There</a>  we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1360.199s">I'm</a>  not sucking up because I have no dog in this game anymore, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1366.121s">Dog</a>  in this fight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1367.021s">See,</a>  this is an American idiom which I have just used for the first time.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1371.743s">We</a>  do a bunch of stuff that we don't even understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1374.543s">Dog</a>  in this fight.</p>

    <p>[Sundaram]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1377.384s">But</a>  then I almost didn't apply for this year's. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1380.125s">I</a>  actually thought, nah, why? <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1383.526s">So</a>  the same person reminded me. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1385.026s">And</a>  two or three other people said, you should apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1387.126s">Heather</a>  Meeker Green. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1389.927s">I</a>  thought she might be here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1391.267s">She</a>  runs the farmer's market. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1393.108s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1393.708s">So</a>  she said, you should apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1394.668s">I</a>  said, but really? <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1396.089s">And</a>  she said, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1397.029s">So</a>  I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1398.189s">Pretty</a>  much before midnight on the day that it was due.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1402.799s">Well,</a>  when I found out that they weren't going to extend my term of office and that they definitely wanted to go with a new laureate every two years, you were the first one that I thought of. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1415.459s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1418.303s">I</a>  said to myself, I hope she applies. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1420.286s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1422.208s">And</a>  full disclosure, they didn't really ask my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1429.077s">So</a>  I would have been on the horns of a bit of a dilemma because I'm friends with folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1437.588s">But</a>  really, I thought that it was a feather in their cap, so to speak, to have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1445.756s">And</a>  I wasn't at all sheepish about sharing the distinction with you because, like I said in the piece,</p>

    <p>[Sundaram]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1455.936s">Pass</a>  the torch along. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1456.837s">It's</a>  moving on. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1457.377s">I</a>  really like that, actually, that we can have many poets coming, because Medford has some really, really good poets.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1464.441s">It</a>  does.</p>

    <p>[Sundaram]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1464.861s">A</a>  couple of others who I hope will apply.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1467.242s">Yeah,</a>  yeah, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1470.924s">And</a>  I know this is subject to change, because the landscape constantly shifts under our feet creatively. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1477.668s">But</a>  if you have a vision, <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1482.011s">of</a>  maybe some of the things that you'd like to do, or some of the things that you'd like to see as Poet Laureate, what would it be? <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1490.28s">What</a>  are some of the things you maybe thought about?</p>

    <p>[Sundaram]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1493.224s">So</a>  I was actually thinking, and I don't know how this would work out, but I do want to run <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1499.651s">both</a>  an online and in-person poetry club. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1504.375s">And</a>  I was wondering, and you can tell me what you think of this, whether it's okay to have one separately for older people and one separately for younger people or mingle and mix and have them, I have to find out where I can hold it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1518.245s">So</a>  I was thinking of asking the public library or maybe here to run a poetry workshop, to invite other poets. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1526.451s">to</a>  just have fun because people want to write, people want to express and poetry I think is one of the most succinct ways in which we can convey emotion and intellect and ideas and joy and sorrow and all of those things without having to go into a long novel or you know explain everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1546.004s">Sometimes</a>  the non-explanation helps. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1549.207s">Sometimes</a>  people just want to be allusive and obtuse. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1555.013s">And</a>  sometimes they want to be direct. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1556.395s">Both</a>  are great in poetry.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1558.137s">Fully</a>  acceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1559.579s">I</a>  mean those 17 syllables in a haiku sometimes is all that needs to be said. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1564.364s">And</a>  then sometimes like me, I'm a long form poet.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1567.067s">I</a>  like long form.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1568.989s">I</a>  like to go in, as they say, and stay there for a little while. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1572.572s">So</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1573.553s">But</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1574.934s">First</a>  of all, I think it's a wonderful idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1576.816s">And</a>  there are a couple of things that I did that kind of scratched at the surface, but never really got there fully. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1586.144s">If</a>  we were talking about doing it collaboratively or whatever, I probably would <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1595.566s">I</a>  wouldn't necessarily want to separate the age groups.</p>

    <p>[Sundaram]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1599.028s">Yeah,</a>  I wouldn't either, really.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1600.709s">But</a>  I also believe that in some instances, young people are far more willing to share with their peer group.</p>

    <p>[Sundaram]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1610.935s">There</a>  is that.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1611.976s">And</a>  they are intergenerational. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1613.937s">I</a>  think what you can do, though, is- Maybe an intersection?</p>

    <p>[Sundaram]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1617.819s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1618.359s">You</a>  know, like Venn diagrams, so they can separate, separate every now and then, get them together. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1622.741s">Absolutely.</a> </p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1623.401s">That'd</a>  be fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1624.342s">Three</a>  weeks separate, two weeks together, three weeks separate.</p>

    <p>[Sundaram]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1627.363s">That</a>  sounds really nice.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1628.803s">So</a>  yeah, I think that's fantastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1631.484s">So</a>  for you, I know that music is a huge part of your creative life. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1637.947s">What</a>  kinds of things are you doing musically right now?</p>

    <p>[Sundaram]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1641.514s">Oh,</a>  well, my husband and I and my daughter, who's now a freshman at UMass Amherst and has been there for exactly one week. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1650.807s">Normally</a>  we sing every night together. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1652.749s">We</a>  sing madrigals, 16th century madrigals. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1656.754s">And</a>  we sing some old jazz standards and some folk songs sometimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1661.756s">We</a>  play guitar together. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1663.016s">All</a>  three of us play guitar. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1664.777s">And</a>  so I do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1666.197s">Right</a>  now it's just Warren and me. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1667.717s">And</a>  so at home we go over those songs together and miss the third voice of our child. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1673.76s">Other</a>  than that, I have returned to playing the sitar. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1678.924s">I'm</a>  a trained sitarist, studied with a student who was a senior disciple of Pandit Ravi Shankar. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1684.608s">It's</a>  been 18 or 20 years since I played the sitar seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1693.614s">So</a>  I got myself another used sitar. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1696.355s">I</a>  have a sitar of my own but that needs work. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1698.996s">I've</a>  had it since I was 16 years old and I brought it to America with me when I came in 1988. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1703.998s">But</a>  I got another sitar that somebody was selling on FB marketplace. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1709.12s">And</a>  I was skeptical. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1710.481s">I</a>  checked it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1711.001s">It</a>  was a really good sitar. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1713.782s">Not</a>  a bad one, anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1715.563s">And</a>  so I started playing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1717.224s">And</a>  I played it practically every day, with the exception of four days somewhere in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1721.786s">And</a>  I'm trying to get back to doing that music as well, my Indian classical music. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1728.23s">For</a>  a long time, Warren and I also performed Hindustani vocal music together, but again, my voice is not its old self, so it's not as flexible, and I need to get back in shape. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1739.659s">Everything</a>  needs to get back in shape. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1741.76s">It's</a>  so annoying to be older.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1743.662s">Preaching</a>  to the choir there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1745.423s">Okay,</a>  all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1746.684s">So,</a>  and you did mention one, obviously, and he's the artistic influence for a lot of folks, particularly in Indian music, but who are some of your artistic influences in music and art and poetry?</p>

    <p>[Sundaram]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1760.299s">In</a>  music, I love the Beatles. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1766.767s">I</a>  grew up listening to the Beatles, so that was my earliest Western music. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1771.752s">I</a>  also heard Louis Armstrong, who was famous all over the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1777.058s">You</a>  know, I never heard of Duke. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1778.78s">I</a>  think I heard of him, but I never heard him. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1782.264s">I</a>  listened to Frank Sinatra. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1784.167s">A</a>  lot of Karen Carpenter.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1788.231s">Queen.</a> </p>

    <p>[Sundaram]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1789.633s">It</a>  was the 70s, you know, and we listened to Karen Carpenter. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1792.456s">She</a>  was sweet. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1793.337s">Yeah,</a>  very sweet music. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1794.558s">Lovely</a>  voice, but some songs are carol king. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1799.24s">And</a>  I listen to, of course, Jethro Tull, and Queen, and Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1804.703s">So</a>  those are some of the Western music influences. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1807.265s">Indian</a>  music, Ravi Shankar, Vimsin Joshi, some of the Indian vocalists that won't be familiar to some of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1816.63s">MS</a>  Subbulakshmi, she's very famous. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1819.231s">So</a>  I listen to a lot of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1821.292s">growing</a>  up, it was playing in the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1823.676s">And</a>  of course, Indian Bollywood songs that were on the radio all over the place, blaring from houses, from rickshaws, from everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1832.529s">It</a>  was in the air. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1833.37s">Warren</a>  can attest to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1834.672s">Music</a>  is in the air. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1837.176s">like</a>  you cannot help but pick it up it's like that and no one thinks twice if you burst into song on the street here you have to think oh my god you know i remember being very wary about singing now i don't care i sing if i want to it doesn't matter but over there it was just you know everybody sang <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1853.627s">okay</a>  and you know you'd get in a train or something and a blind man with a little boy might come with a one-stringed instrument and sing the most unearthly beautiful music and then get off the train and maybe get make a few bits of you know few paisa few coins yeah coins and then go off so you know music was everywhere yeah I love it so that's in music and what was your other</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1876.94s">Art,</a>  poetry, poetry in particular, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Sundaram]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1879.381s">Poetry,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1881.342s">I</a>  had a teacher in the seventh standard, seventh grade as you'd say here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1888.585s">I</a>  went to a convent school, so that's a separate story. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1892.587s">I'm</a>  a child of Indian Tamil Brahmins who <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1896.808s">like</a>  several other Tamilians and Brahmins, sent their children to convent schools because that's where you got the best education. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1904.173s">And</a>  they said, well, in an English-speaking world, we want our children to have the best chance. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1908.716s">So</a>  we were all forced to speak in English in class, in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1912.579s">None</a>  of us were encouraged to speak in our own language. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1914.94s">I'm</a>  embarrassed about that now when I think about it, because I didn't grow up... I grew up speaking my language at home, but not in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1922.686s">And</a>  with my friends, I spoke English. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1924.267s">We</a>  all speak English. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1926.688s">Anyway,</a>  so in Seventh Standard, the nun who was teaching us, Sister Lina, I've acknowledged her in my poetry book. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1934.013s">Sister</a>  Lina was lovely. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1935.553s">She</a>  was a very stern but beautiful-faced woman with a habit. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1940.236s">In</a>  those days, they were the full habit. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1942.077s">I</a>  don't know how they survived Chennai heat. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1944.739s">And</a>  then they switched to saris, thank goodness. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1947.44s">But</a>  they were the full habit. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1948.861s">And</a>  she would read us Wordsworth. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1951.583s">And</a>  my ears perked up. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1952.844s">So</a>  William Wordsworth was the first. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1955.325s">poet</a>  who caught my fancy.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1957.547s">Lyrical</a>  poets, yes.</p>

    <p>[Sundaram]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1958.667s">I</a>  loved the romantics and the lyrical poets at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1961.769s">So</a>  I also loved Sarojini Naidu, who was an Indian poet from the freedom struggle era. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1969.174s">And</a>  she wrote in English, but she wrote beautiful sort of lyrical poems about Indian situations. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1975.719s">And</a>  Rabindranath Tagore, the great Indian poet who won the Nobel Prize. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1979.381s">That's</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1980.962s">He</a>  wrote in Bengali, but his translations were lovely. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1983.644s">And</a>  I grew up reading his work. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1986.146s">And</a>  then of course Keats and Shelley and the rest of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1989.348s">And</a>  then Emily Dickinson and Robert Frost, I loved them. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1994.612s">And</a>  a whole lot of other poets. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1996.374s">I</a>  read everything that came my way. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=1998.616s">When</a>  I was 10, actually, my neighbor Sunda, which was short for Sundaram, which is like my name, he was a writer and a journalist who had this beautiful, pristine bookcase, glass, several glass-covered bookcases in his house. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2014.548s">He'd</a>  invite me over, and he and his wife would be very kind to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2017.311s">His</a>  children were grown, and they had children. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2019.673s">And</a>  I'd jump over the wall from my house to his house, and I'd go and stare like a kid in a candy store, because I loved books. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2028.18s">I</a>  read them nonstop. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2030.723s">I</a>  had no life. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2031.603s">I</a>  mean, other kids, you know, I would climb trees like Maria von Trapp. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2035.187s">I</a>  would scrape my knees. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2037.388s">Oh,</a>  by the way, that was a big influence. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2039.89s">And</a>  I looked at his books and I saw the complete works of Oscar Wilde. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2044.253s">I</a>  saw the complete works of William Shakespeare. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2046.734s">He</a>  also, he loaned me my Rabindranath Tagore and he said, keep it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2050.696s">He</a>  gave me the Oscar Wilde which came with me to America in 1988. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2055.438s">I</a>  came with three big books, the complete works of William Shakespeare that my father gave me, the complete works of Oscar Wilde that Mr. Sundar gave me, and all of the Rabindranath Tagore. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2066.667s">So</a>  his books, they were selections of poetry, so I can't even name all of them, there were so many, but I read all of those. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2074.812s">When</a>  it came time for me to go to college, I'd read everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2077.855s">So</a>  I had the best college life. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2079.477s">I</a>  didn't need to study a thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2081.018s">I</a>  was like, hi, hi. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2082.68s">And</a>  I just did my work.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2084.081s">Perfect.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2084.741s">Perfect.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2085.642s">Perfect.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2086.343s">I</a>  want to keep track of time because there's a couple of things I want to make sure we get to. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2092.483s">So</a>  as you think about some collaborations and youth poetry and engaging more folks in the appreciation of the literary arts in Medford, what do you see as some of the possible challenges and some potential opportunities?</p>

    <p>[Sundaram]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2109.668s">Challenges?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2112.992s">I</a>  can't even think about what the challenges are because I haven't encountered them yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2117.154s">It'll</a>  have to be a flight of imagination right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2120.115s">I</a>  can imagine someone saying, why poetry? <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2122.196s">What's</a>  the big deal? <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2125.417s">Why</a>  should I write poetry? <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2126.578s">Why</a>  are you coming and bothering me with this stuff? <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2129.519s">I</a>  might try and rope them in with some beautiful poems and songs. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2133.541s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2134.201s">I'll</a>  try to get them dancing to something. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2136.342s">There</a>  you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2137.142s">I</a>  have no idea yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2138.084s">I</a>  love it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2139.346s">But</a>  the opportunities, I think I'm going to combine music and poetry. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2145.739s">Everything</a>  has a rhythm.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2147.501s">I</a>  love it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2148.402s">Oh</a>  my gosh. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2149.563s">Maracas.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2150.143s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Sundaram]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2151.004s">So</a>  I'll bring my guitar, my maracas. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2152.845s">I</a>  have a dulcimer that Warren got me as a present once. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2155.327s">Oh</a>  my goodness. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2156.248s">And</a>  see what I can do.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2158.029s">Well,</a>  it's funny because, and maybe I thought about it once or twice, but I was never really thinking that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2170.139s">I</a>  wasn't thinking the way I should have been about the intersection of poetry and music. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2175.963s">But</a>  you performed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2177.704s">Well,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2178.464s">I</a>  had done a little bit, but meeting Jonathan Fagan kind of changed my trajectory considerably. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2184.765s">And</a>  we have a CD coming out sometime in the next couple of months of the jazz that we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2192.247s">And</a>  it's become the intersection of jazz and social justice. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2196.688s">So</a>  it makes perfect sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2198.589s">And</a>  it particularly makes a lot of sense when you're thinking about young people. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2204.25s">because</a>  so much of the social information that they receive, and even the social contract that they begin to build in their own minds, comes via the music that they listen to. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2214.357s">That's</a>  so true. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2215.338s">So</a>  if positive messages and poetry can be blended with the kind of music that they're interested in listening to, and even some that they might not be, but get exposed to and say, ooh, this is a thing.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2229.147s">Yeah,</a>  exactly.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2230.127s">Yeah,</a>  I think it's cool. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2234.431s">So,</a>  what would people who are just meeting you be surprised to learn about you?</p>

    <p>[Sundaram]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2245.374s">What</a>  surprised you about me? <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2247.496s">I'm</a>  sorry, I shouldn't ask a question.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2248.756s">No,</a>  it's good, it's good. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2250.878s">It's</a>  a fair question. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2252.219s">I</a>  think what surprised me about you is how genial you are. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2261.344s">If</a>  that's the word that I can use. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2263.025s">How</a>  ready you are to embrace the potential for friendship. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2269.329s">I</a>  mean, you didn't know me from a can of paint, but you knew that I was a poet. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2275.631s">And</a>  I think you maybe gave me a little bit of credit for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2279.032s">But</a>  when we talked, I immediately got the sense from you that here is a person that is ready to embrace a friendship. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2288.714s">And</a>  again, you didn't know me, but it sounded to me like you had already said to yourself, well, if he's willing, I would like to be his friend.</p>

    <p>[Sundaram]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2299.386s">Well,</a>  that's a lovely thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2301.146s">And</a>  you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2303.707s">It</a>  goes both ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2304.847s">I</a>  mean, you are one of the most generous, genial people I have met. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2310.789s">And</a>  you were so warm and welcoming of me and Max and Julia, the other poets who we performed with. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2320.032s">And</a>  you just, you didn't... <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2321.872s">begrudge</a>  us our poetry. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2325.513s">You</a>  just come on in. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2327.594s">And</a>  so you made it possible for us to feel that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2330.734s">And</a>  so thank you for that comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2333.195s">You're</a>  welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2333.495s">But</a>  I think you are also a very genial person.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2336.716s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2337.356s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2337.856s">I</a>  appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2341.417s">It's</a>  lovely to hear it and it felt good to say it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2344.64s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2345.6s">So</a>  yeah, absolutely.</p>

    <p>[Sundaram]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2346.661s">I</a>  don't know what would surprise people. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2348.442s">Maybe</a>  the fact that I have a dot. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2350.784s">Is</a>  the dot even in the middle of my voice?</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2353.566s">It's</a>  sitting where it's supposed to sit, I think.</p>

    <p>[Sundaram]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2355.868s">It</a>  moves around. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2357.049s">It</a>  has a mind of its own. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2357.849s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2360.311s">Sometimes</a>  it shows up on my shoulder, I have no idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2364.152s">So</a>  yeah, I have a dot and people wonder whether that's a sign of religion and yes it is for people but for me it's an identity marker. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2372.634s">That's</a>  all it is for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2374.535s">It</a>  reminds me, it's my umbilicus, it reminds me of my past and holds me to that because it's very easy to get swept up in whatever culture you're in. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2385.457s">It's</a>  very easy to forget. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2391.039s">You</a>  have to remember some part of who you were. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2394.201s">And</a>  any person who thinks enough will reinvent himself, herself, themselves as time goes on. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2401.244s">And</a>  we are constantly shedding the skin of our past selves. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2405.566s">But</a>  I don't want to forget that part. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2407.427s">No,</a>  that part is beautiful.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2409.328s">It's</a>  wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2410.348s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2411.269s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2411.969s">And</a>  then the other thing that, you know, it didn't surprise me to learn about you because I had a sense that this was going to be the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2421.881s">But</a>  in hearing you talk, and particularly in hearing you to read, just the... <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2428.228s">just</a>  kind of the lyrical nature of your voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2431.71s">It</a>  sounds like singing, even when it's just talking.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2435.292s">Lovely,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2437.253s">And</a>  for me, because I always like to think that that's what I do, that the rhythm and the lyrical nature of what I'm trying to get across, I'm always hopeful that people hear that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2450.421s">They</a>  say, you don't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2452.502s">Man,</a>  that's musical, brother. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2454.463s">that</a>  jazz thing you just got that flow right and i'm even meeting you know brothers that you know they're a little bit more hardcore you know they you know they i say like we say they from the hood you know what i'm saying and so when they hear me they're they're like yo man i'm <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2473.181s">Yo,</a>  do you rap? <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2474.622s">Do</a>  you rap? <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2477.123s">I</a>  said, not knowingly, not intentionally, but a lot of where I'm coming from has kind of that lyrical edge to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2488.008s">And</a>  especially when I'm going deep on some of these themes of social justice, because I know that younger people won't receive it the way that I want them to unless it kind of comes at them <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2500.894s">with</a>  a bit more of an edge to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2503.315s">So</a>  I have those places in me, too.</p>

    <p>[Sundaram]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2505.076s">I</a>  love the internal rhymes and the end rhymes that you have. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2508.898s">They're</a>  so wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2509.899s">And</a>  the consonances and assonances that you use in your writing, it's very rhythmic and flowing.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2515.322s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2515.882s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2518.463s">So</a>  I don't want the people to leave without hearing how wonderful a poet you are and you have your new book with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2525.987s">So</a>  I was wondering if you would read a couple of pieces for us.</p>

    <p>[Sundaram]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2530.876s">By</a>  the way, can you hear me well at the back? <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2533.578s">OK,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2534.739s">Because</a>  sometimes people say I'm not speaking into the mic, so I just want to make sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2539.302s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2541.383s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2544.225s">I</a>  didn't actually plan to decide which one to read, so let me see. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2549.188s">It's</a>  OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2556.846s">Okay,</a>  this is a more personal one, personal in the sense of not revealing my history or anything, but about my body. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2564.651s">My</a>  body. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2565.412s">A</a>  body is a curious thing to possess. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2569.375s">I</a>  am conscious of mine as a friend with her own blind needs, her own mute sorrows, her loud joys. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2577.06s">Her</a>  love of some fragrances and loathing of certain smells. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2581.161s">Her</a>  ears that welcome all music. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2583.462s">Her</a>  eyes that see beyond facades, but forget to see the facade itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2588.904s">She</a>  is the entity who shares my other consciousness. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2592.145s">When</a>  she is out of sorts, but I'm sanguine, we confuse each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2597.046s">But</a>  sometimes it's the other way around. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2599.347s">But</a>  mostly we keep peace between us. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2602.368s">She</a>  keeps track of time, so that even when I'm not near a clock, she lets me know. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2607.209s">When</a>  I'm hurt, she forces me to shut down my other self and attend to her. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2611.931s">This</a>  is as it should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2613.791s">She</a>  has given me space to live within her, and I love her, and I thank her for giving me room. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2619.553s">She</a>  is a map of my journeys, and the road on which the journeys took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2624.954s">And</a>  her imperfections, so many, fill me with quiet affection. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2631.116s">And...</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2633.143s">She</a>  has shed her skin so many times and donned new ones, and her hands, all veined, have held this earth and other hands with love and trust, ready to give, even when she lost sometimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2647.211s">Yes,</a>  she has failed me at times, but then I failed her even more. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2651.854s">But</a>  mostly, we are at peace. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2654.055s">I</a>  shall miss her when she dies. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2656.196s">I</a>  do not think she'll remember to miss me at the time of her passing.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2660.385s">Oh,</a>  wow. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2661.406s">Fantastic.</a> </p>

    <p>[Sundaram]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2665.889s">Thank</a>  you so much.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2667.27s">So</a>  I don't lie. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2669.231s">She's</a>  wonderfully lyrical. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2671.532s">She</a>  has a vivid imagination. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2673.494s">And</a>  she knows her internal rhythms really, really well. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2678.357s">Would</a>  you read another one for us? <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2679.578s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2679.878s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Sundaram]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2680.498s">Let's</a>  see. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2688.826s">So</a>  this was when I was reading about children in cages in detention centers and it was really hard and you feel so impotent with rage and you can't do anything to help because what are you going to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2705.59s">You</a>  know, we don't have the power to go in and fix anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2708.391s">All</a>  we can do is give money to the organizations that do, that are able to get their lawyers in and do all of that work. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2714.952s">But</a>  I thought I'd write a poem about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2717.573s">Here's</a>  the Thing is the title. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2719.973s">Here's</a>  the thing about children in detention centers, abandoned, sick, dying, separated from all that is good. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2728.422s">One</a>  cannot make poetry from it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2730.865s">One</a>  cannot make art from it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2732.867s">One</a>  cannot make anything from it, for it is unimaginable. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2737.411s">It</a>  is an offense against humanity. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2739.874s">It</a>  makes all other emotion hollow. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2742.376s">It</a>  makes it hard to live a life that holds meaning. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2746.241s">All</a>  joys and sadnesses become muted when set against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2750.324s">And</a>  yet we struggle on, stupid, stupefied, stunned by it all. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2755.648s">Still</a>  laugh, still eat and drink, still find pleasure in daily things. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2760.871s">For</a>  if only sorrow and horror define us, what's left? <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2765.314s">So</a>  we make music and art and we sing even when our voices crack and other cracks form within. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2772.476s">Dual</a>  consciousness is the new burden all of us carry as we try and carve out a different vision for all people, perhaps a different life, and work in what ways we can to tilt the balance a little in favor of humanity. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=2788.94s">And</a>  if the horror we see doesn't kill us all, the work we do might just save us all.</p>

href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=5944.721s">It's</a>  called I Don't Know. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=5945.722s">That's</a>  what it's called, literally, which is funny. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=5950.487s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=5955.566s">And</a>  I wrote this actually because I've been really inspired by, I'll speak into the mic, Thich Nhat Hanh, who's one of my favorite teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=5966.191s">If</a>  you don't know Thich Nhat Hanh, he is a Zen Buddhist master. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=5972.875s">He's</a>  so amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=5975.076s">My</a>  favorite book of his, he has many books. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=5978.298s">I</a>  would say hundreds of books. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=5980.399s">And</a>  he's an amazing poet. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=5983.46s">And</a>  he's an amazing teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=5984.38s">And</a>  he passed away last February. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=5986.681s">I</a>  think it's February 2022, or maybe January. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=5992.683s">And</a>  I wrote this song because I was really inspired by his teachings about the present moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=6000.807s">And</a>  I'm going to tune a little bit more, because I realize that it's a little humid outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=6011.542s">Our</a>  instruments have to get in the present. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=6013.203s">Yeah,</a>  it's like, ah. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=6021.587s">And</a>  living in the present moment is hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=6023.949s">It's</a>  one of the central practices of Buddhism. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=6027.25s">And</a>  it's also one of the lessons you keep learning over and over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=6031.092s">There's</a>  this podcast called The Way Out Is In. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=6033.854s">It's</a>  the Plum Village podcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=6036.155s">And</a>  Plum Village is the monastery that Thich Nhat Hanh <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=6041.478s">It's</a>  in France, and I think now he has a monastery in Thailand, and there's a Deer Park Monastery in upstate New York, and there's many monasteries now. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=6057.646s">Yeah,</a>  like one of his attendants, his name is Brother Fapu, he was here, actually I got to meet him, Brother Fapu, he's like my, he's like a Buddhist celebrity to me, he's just an amazing teacher, he was Thich Nhat Hanh's, and he would like probably hate that I said that, but he's an amazing young Buddhist practitioner, a Buddhist teacher, and attendant to Thich Nhat Hanh for quite a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=6079.368s">And</a>  I came here to Harvard to open up the Chan School of Public Health, or open up a Thich Nhat Hanh, I think, research on meditation at Harvard. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=6091.473s">And</a>  he said that, <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=6096.835s">Thich</a>  Nhat Hanh always had to practice mindful walking. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=6099.177s">Like</a>  there's this thing, the practice of just mindful walking is just like taking, being aware of each step. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=6106.384s">And</a>  we always walk, you know, because we want to get somewhere, but the practice for Thich Nhat Hanh is just walking to walk, walking with no destination. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=6114.671s">And</a>  so, <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=6117.854s">I</a>  just think that that inspired the song too. <a href="https://youtu.be/dsgiYCm1_2I&t=6120.74s">And</a>  it's like a little mantra. <a
