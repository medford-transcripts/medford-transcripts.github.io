[SPEAKER_18]: This is for Aggie Tudin, our tree warden.

25
00:01:13,116 --> 00:01:13,836
[SPEAKER_18]: Go ahead, Councilor.

26
00:01:16,698 --> 00:01:29,425
[SPEAKER_15]: Just a few short weeks ago, our tree warden, Aggie Tudin, was recognized by being selected the Seth H. Swift Tree Warden of the Year, presented by the Massachusetts Tree Wardens and Forestry Association.

27
00:01:29,941 --> 00:01:35,291
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think it's very appropriate that we recognize Aggie for all her hard work and dedication that she does on behalf of the city of Medford.

28
00:01:35,752 --> 00:01:40,380
[SPEAKER_15]: It's quite an honor and a privilege to have the tree warden of the year working here right out of Medford City Hall.

29
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,422
[SPEAKER_15]: So congratulations, Aggie.

00:01:41,442 --> 00:01:41,963
[SPEAKER_15]: Please step up.

31
00:01:59,982 --> 00:02:13,726

[SPEAKER_15]: Signed, Medford City Council President Frederick N. Dello Russo, Adam Knight, City Council.

[SPEAKER_27]: And thank you to all the council members.

00:02:33,985 --> 00:02:40,607
[SPEAKER_27]: I've had the privilege and pleasure of working with all of you on various tree related issues around town and hope we continue to do so.

37
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:45,888
[SPEAKER_27]: Um, I will say that it's, it was quite shocking and surprising to have received the award.

38
00:02:45,908 --> 00:02:56,552
[SPEAKER_27]: Um, I've had great support from all people in the city, from the mayor who entrusted me with a position, uh, to the various departments in city hall, especially DPW,

39
00:02:58,449 --> 00:02:59,730
[SPEAKER_27]: and this council.

40
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:08,837
[SPEAKER_27]: The residents as well deserve a lot of credit because we share stewardship of our trees and this award wouldn't be possible without all of us working together.

41
00:03:08,978 --> 00:03:13,782
[SPEAKER_27]: So I humbly accept and hope we continue to have great successful things with our trees.

42
00:03:14,262 --> 00:03:21,488
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks so much.

43
00:03:21,528 --> 00:03:22,469
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

44
00:03:22,749 --> 00:03:23,730
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Carfiolo.

45
00:03:30,313 --> 00:03:31,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

46
00:03:33,675 --> 00:03:35,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Four years ago, I didn't even know we had a tree warden in the city.

47
00:03:36,677 --> 00:03:37,657
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to lie to you.

48
00:03:38,438 --> 00:03:42,560
[SPEAKER_02]: Since then, I've worked very closely with Ag in a lot of things.

49
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:51,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Her and I have developed a business program for the trees, for the buy a tree, get a tree program that we implemented last year.

50
00:03:51,705 --> 00:03:58,009
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just want to commend her for her work that she does and the call that she gets back to you within hours.

51
00:03:59,747 --> 00:04:03,610
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, I think we're waiting on Councilor Camuso next.

52
00:04:04,551 --> 00:04:04,711
[SPEAKER_18]: No?

53
00:04:04,951 --> 00:04:06,032
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes?

54
00:04:06,092 --> 00:04:07,293
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Penta, go ahead.

55
00:04:07,913 --> 00:04:09,454
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm shocked that you didn't know four years ago.

56
00:04:09,835 --> 00:04:14,118
[SPEAKER_11]: She's following in the good footsteps of Jesse Jessalonis, who won that for the city.

57
00:04:14,698 --> 00:04:18,461
[SPEAKER_11]: And so we have an excellent tree history here in the city of Medford, you know?

58
00:04:18,601 --> 00:04:22,264
[SPEAKER_11]: So, Aggie, continue on, and good luck.

59
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:25,626
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Councilor Penta.

60
00:04:26,693 --> 00:04:28,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead, Councilor Marks.

61
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:30,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

62
00:04:30,254 --> 00:04:36,796
[SPEAKER_03]: I've known Aggie Tudin for a number of years, and you couldn't meet a kinder, gentler person.

63
00:04:37,457 --> 00:04:39,697
[SPEAKER_03]: She takes her job very, very seriously.

64
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:54,102
[SPEAKER_03]: She is the biggest advocate in this city to maintain and save our shade trees throughout the community, and has done yeoman's work to improve the quality of life in this community.

65
00:04:54,847 --> 00:04:57,028
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would personally like to thank her.

66
00:04:57,048 --> 00:05:04,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I, uh, have had a number of dealings, uh, as council is both mentioned, uh, Aggie gets right back to you.

67
00:05:05,292 --> 00:05:06,372
[SPEAKER_03]: She gets you an answer.

68
00:05:06,872 --> 00:05:08,913
[SPEAKER_03]: She gets right out to the site.

69
00:05:09,633 --> 00:05:14,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and she has done exemplary work on behalf of the residents of this community.

70
00:05:14,696 --> 00:05:17,297
[SPEAKER_03]: And I personally want to thank you, Aggie and keep up the good work.

71
00:05:19,057 --> 00:05:19,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

72
00:05:19,378 --> 00:05:20,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Marksley.

73
00:05:21,672 --> 00:05:24,560
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. President, Stephanie Borick, 5, Hedlund Way, Medford.

74
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,450
[SPEAKER_22]: I'd be remiss if I didn't get up and say a few words on Aggie's behalf.

75
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:38,241
[SPEAKER_22]: I had the privilege of attending the luncheon in her name, and it was quite evident that she's well-respected in her industry, as well as in the city of Medford.

76
00:05:38,281 --> 00:05:48,969
[SPEAKER_22]: She has forged such partnerships with different organizations, not only the National Grids and Electric Company, but also some of the outreach from UMass Amherst and Harvard.

77
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:55,013
[SPEAKER_22]: She's just formed an amazing amount of contacts and business cooperations that we've seen in the city.

78
00:05:56,534 --> 00:06:03,660
[SPEAKER_22]: We are lucky, lucky people to have her in our community, and she cares so deeply for our trees and for our citizens and for all of us.

79
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,823
[SPEAKER_22]: So congratulations, Aggie, and we're very proud of her.

80
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:08,684
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Stephanie.

81
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:14,809
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

82
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:21,595
[SPEAKER_18]: Item number 15-010, notice of a public hearing.

83

[SPEAKER_18]: Hearing and seeing none.

[SPEAKER_18]: We're in the middle of a public hearing.

100
00:08:16,807 --> 00:08:19,830
[SPEAKER_18]: We're opening up to those in opposition.

101
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:21,071
[SPEAKER_18]: Any in opposition?

102
00:08:22,352 --> 00:08:27,356
[SPEAKER_18]: Hearing and seeing none, the President opens this up to debate.

103
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:33,381
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Caraviello, Chairman of the Zoning and Licensing for recommendation.

104
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:39,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, if you could just explain the type of business you're going to be operating this, so people know.

105
00:08:39,406 --> 00:08:39,686
[SPEAKER_25]: Sure.

106
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:41,567
[SPEAKER_25]: It's an adult daycare center.

107
00:08:42,308 --> 00:08:45,090
[SPEAKER_25]: It will take care of clients from 8 a.m.

108
00:08:46,719 --> 00:08:49,720
[SPEAKER_25]: There will be an activity room, a quiet room, a dining room.

109
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,580
[SPEAKER_25]: There will be three meals.

110
00:08:50,941 --> 00:09:01,144
[SPEAKER_25]: I had presented to the council, it should have been in your package, a letter which describes it, but in essence, they will be transported to and from the site by vans.

111
00:09:02,024 --> 00:09:04,785
[SPEAKER_25]: There will be activities scheduled for the clients.

112
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:07,046
[SPEAKER_25]: There will be three meals served.

113
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:10,307
[SPEAKER_25]: Any of their health needs will be taken care of.

114
00:09:11,047 --> 00:09:12,348
[SPEAKER_25]: There will be nurses on site.

115
00:09:13,146 --> 00:09:19,631
[SPEAKER_25]: They will also take them to medical appointments if they're off-site from the daycare centre, and they do provide some grocery services.

116
00:09:19,671 --> 00:09:22,713
[SPEAKER_25]: They'll take them to buy groceries and then they can bring them home.

117
00:09:23,053 --> 00:09:27,797
[SPEAKER_25]: It allows them to stay within the community in their home rather than in a residential.

118
00:09:28,037 --> 00:09:29,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a cost for the service?

119
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:32,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Does their insurance pay for it?

120
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,463
[SPEAKER_25]: It is paid by insurance primarily, yes.

121
00:09:36,664 --> 00:09:36,904
Thank you.

122
00:09:36,924 --> 00:09:38,205
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President.

123
00:09:38,265 --> 00:09:39,706
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Cavill.

124
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:40,406
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Camuso.

125
00:09:40,707 --> 00:09:41,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

126
00:09:42,742 --> 00:09:44,303
[SPEAKER_09]: You make a motion for approval?

127
00:09:44,964 --> 00:09:47,225
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to make a motion for approval on this, Mr. President.

128
00:09:47,245 --> 00:09:49,387
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a long overdue thing in our community.

129
00:09:49,827 --> 00:09:51,688
[SPEAKER_09]: We're proud to have many nursing facilities.

130
00:09:52,089 --> 00:10:02,376
[SPEAKER_09]: But one thing that I like to see as an elected official is give people the opportunity to participate in programs and still maintain ownership and residence in their own homes.

131
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:11,903
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is going to be another particular case for Medford residents to be able to do that, similar to the Buddy Coholan Center that we have for people with Alzheimer's and dementia.

132
00:10:12,629 --> 00:10:16,810
[SPEAKER_09]: as well as some other smaller establishments in our community.

133
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:20,552
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think this will be a great addition to the South Medford neighbourhood.

134
00:10:20,932 --> 00:10:23,092
[SPEAKER_09]: And this will also spur some economic development.

135
00:10:23,553 --> 00:10:35,876
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have, say, 30 clients and you have to feed 30 people, they're going to be doing grocery shopping in the area or utilising local businesses, whether it may be for prescriptions or first aid stuff or things of that nature.

136
00:10:36,377 --> 00:10:40,678
[SPEAKER_09]: So I see this as a win-win to keep a building from being vacant in our community.

137
00:10:41,192 --> 00:10:43,053
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'd like to move approval, Mr. President.

138
00:10:43,314 --> 00:10:51,099
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion of approval by Councilor, Councilor Camuso, Vice President Lungo-Koehn, and I just need to correct myself.

139
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,821
[SPEAKER_18]: It's Councilor Knight who is chairman of said committee.

140
00:10:54,162 --> 00:10:54,782
[SPEAKER_18]: My apologies.

141
00:10:56,143 --> 00:10:58,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

142
00:10:59,165 --> 00:11:04,990
[SPEAKER_04]: In your letter it mentions that Medford Adult Day Healthcare Center has opened in other locations.

143
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:05,750
[SPEAKER_25]: That's correct.

144
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:06,190
[SPEAKER_25]: They have.

145
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,261
[SPEAKER_25]: establishments in Natick, Revere, and Lynn.

146
00:11:11,281 --> 00:11:19,123
[SPEAKER_25]: They've been operating, not this particular LLC, they each have their own separate LLC, but Mr. Ritzkin and Ms.

147
00:11:19,344 --> 00:11:21,444
[SPEAKER_25]: Brodsky are the managers of those LLCs.

148
00:11:21,484 --> 00:11:29,347
[SPEAKER_25]: So they, under different entities, they have been operating adult daycare centers in Lynn, Revere, and I believe Needham.

149
00:11:29,847 --> 00:11:30,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Needham.

150
00:11:31,648 --> 00:11:33,868
[SPEAKER_04]: And those are existing businesses currently?

151
00:11:33,988 --> 00:11:34,589
[SPEAKER_25]: That's correct.

152
00:11:35,869 --> 00:11:38,110
[SPEAKER_04]: And what licenses do you,

153
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,440
[SPEAKER_04]: you hold?

154
00:11:55,323 --> 00:12:20,590
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I just want to make sure you had licensing and as far as employees, they're all back, you know background checks quarried Okay, thank you and they also belong to professional associations that's in my letter as well Thank you, thank you Councilor Penta Under the after the words you seven to operate quote of the institution.

155
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,190
[SPEAKER_11]: What are we talking about?

156
00:12:22,838 --> 00:12:34,422
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, the situation is that the bylaws are rather outdated in terms of existing businesses that now exist now as opposed to earlier.

157
00:12:34,482 --> 00:12:46,927
[SPEAKER_25]: So in my letter, I was indicating that in the C2 zone, you do have community adult recreation centers, but there is no specific adult daycare center use in the regulations.

158
00:12:47,027 --> 00:12:51,749
[SPEAKER_25]: So when I went to building for a permit, they classified it as other institution.

159
00:12:52,314 --> 00:13:00,199
[SPEAKER_25]: Um, but in the C2 district, you'll see in my letter, there are a number of uses which are similar to this particular use.

160
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:21,553
[SPEAKER_11]: My question I think would become curious to the point that since it's not included specifically, if this would need a public advertisement to change the zoning to include it rather than come under the guys quote unquote of other institution in your other institution of what you're saying is an adult daycare center, which is not found under,

161
00:13:22,025 --> 00:13:24,265
[SPEAKER_11]: an exact terminology as another institution.

162
00:13:26,046 --> 00:13:29,126
[SPEAKER_25]: Building indicated that in other institutions, that's where it would fall.

163
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:32,667
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, other institutions is other institutions at this point.

164
00:13:32,887 --> 00:13:41,028
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm sure there are other uses that fall under that other institutions provision, which.

165
00:13:43,149 --> 00:13:48,309
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's what my concern would be, to give something out that wasn't properly vetted, so to speak, through rezoning.

166
00:13:48,549 --> 00:13:51,450
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got no problem going forward with it, but I'd like to get a report back.

167
00:13:52,285 --> 00:14:06,998
[SPEAKER_11]: as to whether this terminology, what are you calling an adult daycare center, since it's not found under the terminology of other institution can be included under the term other institution for the purposes of this particular vote.

168
00:14:07,298 --> 00:14:18,948
[SPEAKER_18]: So on the motion of approval, Councilor, uh, had to request amends this to request a determination, legal determination as it relates to,

169
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:33,800
[SPEAKER_11]: whether the zoning for an adult daycare center is legal terminology for other institutions, or does, in fact, a public hearing have to take place to make this become inclusive of other institutions?

170
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,161
[SPEAKER_25]: If I can go to the definitions.

171
00:14:35,201 --> 00:14:37,782
[SPEAKER_19]: If the clerk can answer that, please.

172
00:14:38,023 --> 00:14:42,745
[SPEAKER_19]: The zoning administrator determines what the zoning is on anything.

173
00:14:43,085 --> 00:14:45,246
[SPEAKER_19]: And the zoning administrator is the building commissioner.

174
00:14:45,867 --> 00:14:48,588
[SPEAKER_19]: And he's the one to determine that,

175
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:51,868
[SPEAKER_19]: This falls under other institutions right now.

176
00:14:52,469 --> 00:15:01,814
[SPEAKER_19]: So I mean, on future, if you wanted to create a category for adult, you would have to have your own public hearing to create a category for it.

177
00:15:02,074 --> 00:15:09,558
[SPEAKER_19]: But I mean, as far as going for this particular paper, that's how we classify it right now, is other institutions.

178
00:15:09,598 --> 00:15:11,579
[SPEAKER_19]: So the public hearing is actually correct.

179
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:16,141
[SPEAKER_19]: But if you want to carve out it, that becomes a zoning

180
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,981
[SPEAKER_11]: ordinance in itself, but all fairness to the council and anyone who watching and the petition is here.

181
00:15:23,281 --> 00:15:24,521
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have a letter that says that.

182
00:15:24,921 --> 00:15:32,823
[SPEAKER_11]: So if the building commissioner is the, um, I won't use the terminology zoning authority to make this inclusive of other institution.

183
00:15:33,103 --> 00:15:45,005
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we should have had a letter that said that because it's obvious that we're operating other institution by including the terminology adult daycare center, um, LLC to be, to be included here.

184
00:15:45,667 --> 00:15:50,089
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just protecting our interests, but more importantly, I want to make sure that the zoning is appropriate for this.

185
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,991
[SPEAKER_11]: And so nothing comes back and says, wait a minute, you know, it's not included.

186
00:15:54,031 --> 00:15:55,052
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not the way it's supposed to be.

187
00:15:55,452 --> 00:16:07,157
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got no problem going forward with it, but I want that letter that says that this adult daycare center can be constituted as a legal entity under other institution on the unit than the use of it.

188
00:16:07,498 --> 00:16:07,838
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

189
00:16:07,938 --> 00:16:12,680
[SPEAKER_18]: So if we could get that explanation on the matter brought forth by councilor

190
00:16:13,384 --> 00:16:23,009
[SPEAKER_18]: Penta from the, uh, uh, housing, uh, the building inspector, uh, Mr. Moki, uh, as amended by councilor Penta.

191
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:23,590
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

192
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:24,490
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Marks.

193
00:16:25,471 --> 00:16:26,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

194
00:16:26,371 --> 00:16:27,972
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a few questions.

195
00:16:28,753 --> 00:16:31,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, how, uh, is your clientele referred?

196
00:16:38,018 --> 00:16:39,859
[SPEAKER_18]: Could you step closer to the microphone please?

197
00:16:41,496 --> 00:16:55,645
[SPEAKER_26]: Because it's a community-based service, it could be the client can be self-referred, it could be referred by the doctor, by the social worker, or by any elderly services, or by the ASAP, which is the aging service provider, Mystic Valley.

198
00:16:56,666 --> 00:17:01,009
[SPEAKER_26]: So it can be from either the case managers there or from the healthcare providers.

199
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:06,632
[SPEAKER_03]: How many clients can you accommodate on a daily average?

200
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:10,215
[SPEAKER_26]: We're looking for about 100.

201
00:17:11,659 --> 00:17:14,822
[SPEAKER_03]: 100.

202
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,822
[SPEAKER_03]: And what is your staff to client ratio?

203
00:17:14,962 --> 00:17:18,404
[SPEAKER_26]: Staff to client ratio now is 1 to 6 according to the regulations.

204
00:17:19,025 --> 00:17:20,666
[SPEAKER_03]: 1 to 6 is state regulations?

205
00:17:20,786 --> 00:17:26,591
[SPEAKER_26]: It's state regulations and it's including the medical personnel, which is the nurses, which is 1 to 12.

206
00:17:26,711 --> 00:17:28,973
[SPEAKER_20]: 1 to 12 for the program aides.

207
00:17:29,433 --> 00:17:30,214
[SPEAKER_26]: And the program aides.

208
00:17:31,535 --> 00:17:33,196
[SPEAKER_20]: Social workers and case managers.

209
00:17:34,889 --> 00:17:37,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have any nurses on site?

210
00:17:37,551 --> 00:17:39,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have any nurse practitioners?

211
00:17:39,852 --> 00:17:43,755
[SPEAKER_26]: We don't need any nurse practitioners because they remain in the community.

212
00:17:44,155 --> 00:17:53,901
[SPEAKER_26]: People can stay with their own primary care physician who is signing up on the care plan, which is developed by the Adult Day Healthcare nurses and sent to them on a quarterly basis.

213
00:17:54,301 --> 00:17:56,202
[SPEAKER_03]: So you dispense medication on site?

214
00:17:56,623 --> 00:17:57,803
[SPEAKER_26]: If that's a doctor's order.

215
00:17:59,024 --> 00:18:00,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Is medication kept on site?

216
00:18:01,131 --> 00:18:02,532
[SPEAKER_26]: Medications are kept on the site.

217
00:18:02,552 --> 00:18:07,695
[SPEAKER_26]: We usually work with the pharmacies who provide the day pack specific to that patient.

218
00:18:07,715 --> 00:18:09,396
[SPEAKER_03]: So is medication kept overnight?

219
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:13,678
[SPEAKER_26]: It could be, but usually it's delivered daily.

220
00:18:14,959 --> 00:18:17,680
[SPEAKER_03]: So if it's kept overnight, is there... It's a medical cart.

221
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,202
[SPEAKER_26]: It's a special medical cart which exists, which is locked.

222
00:18:22,042 --> 00:18:22,823
[SPEAKER_03]: This is locked and...

223
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:30,148
[SPEAKER_26]: It's a double lock because usually the nursing station needs to be locked, and then there is a medication card that needs to be locked.

224
00:18:30,229 --> 00:18:33,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there any regulations that govern the security of medications?

225
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:35,191
[SPEAKER_26]: There is a regulation that governs that.

226
00:18:35,811 --> 00:18:37,973
[SPEAKER_03]: And you'll be adhering to all those regulations?

227
00:18:38,813 --> 00:18:38,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

228
00:18:39,614 --> 00:18:44,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Locally, does the Board of Health oversee your area?

229
00:18:44,176 --> 00:18:51,760
[SPEAKER_26]: The Board of Health is giving us the clear permit, which is if people with insulin need to inject themselves and they need to help.

230
00:18:52,302 --> 00:18:55,965
[SPEAKER_26]: So they really oversee how do we dispense the insulin.

231
00:18:56,645 --> 00:18:59,848
[SPEAKER_26]: And they also, because we're serving food, they also oversee that.

232
00:18:59,868 --> 00:19:00,628
[SPEAKER_26]: Right.

233
00:19:00,969 --> 00:19:03,931
[SPEAKER_03]: And have you had a walkthrough yet at the site?

234
00:19:03,951 --> 00:19:04,752
[SPEAKER_26]: Not yet.

235
00:19:05,432 --> 00:19:06,693
[SPEAKER_03]: So that hasn't taken place yet?

236
00:19:07,174 --> 00:19:08,975
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

237
00:19:09,595 --> 00:19:10,936
[SPEAKER_26]: This is usually the last step.

238
00:19:11,537 --> 00:19:14,419
[SPEAKER_26]: Once everything is in there, that's usually the last step.

239
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:18,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'd like to see how process is the last step.

240
00:19:19,781 --> 00:19:20,962
[SPEAKER_03]: all the papers ahead of time.

241
00:19:20,982 --> 00:19:23,505
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, I'm sure they do a walkthrough without our permit.

242
00:19:37,338 --> 00:19:41,081
[SPEAKER_25]: Their walkthrough is not contingent on whether... Well, they were certainly noticed as part of the special permit process.

243
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:41,781
[SPEAKER_20]: Right, right.

244
00:19:41,821 --> 00:19:53,128
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, it's going to be a lot of build-out by the codes on certain numbers of toilets and offices that are dedicated for the clients, for the employees, etc., etc.

245
00:19:53,148 --> 00:19:57,891
[SPEAKER_20]: It usually takes about a couple of months, two, three months to do the proper build-out.

246
00:19:57,911 --> 00:19:58,011
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

247
00:20:00,252 --> 00:20:02,374
[SPEAKER_03]: You also mentioned that you provide three meals.

248
00:20:03,254 --> 00:20:03,434
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

249
00:20:03,474 --> 00:20:05,355
[SPEAKER_03]: What other activities are done with the...

250
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:08,583
[SPEAKER_03]: people that are staying there for the day.

251
00:20:09,624 --> 00:20:10,504
[SPEAKER_26]: What are the activities?

252
00:20:10,905 --> 00:20:13,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than eating, what else do they do?

253
00:20:13,787 --> 00:20:22,753
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, we have a recreational therapist on staff for 40 hours a week, so that's a full-time position that needs to be created locally.

254
00:20:23,213 --> 00:20:33,660
[SPEAKER_26]: This person needs to be usually either certified or have a bachelor degree and experience working at least two years with the elderly and with the geriatric population.

255
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,582
[SPEAKER_26]: There is an activity that provides memory training,

256
00:20:37,177 --> 00:20:42,120
[SPEAKER_26]: that provides the verbal expressions, that they build a range of motions.

257
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:53,826
[SPEAKER_26]: And a lot of this is developed in conjunction with a social worker, individually developed in conjunction with a social worker and the nurses, because we have special meetings twice a week.

258
00:20:54,607 --> 00:21:00,510
[SPEAKER_26]: It's an interdisciplinary team that develops plan of care, which is then signed off by the primary care physician.

259
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:03,632
[SPEAKER_26]: So there are group activities and individual activities for each participant.

260
00:21:04,241 --> 00:21:06,362
[SPEAKER_03]: So is the actual setup inclusive?

261
00:21:06,462 --> 00:21:10,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Is everyone together or are they in separate rooms or separate areas?

262
00:21:10,183 --> 00:21:10,723
[SPEAKER_03]: It depends.

263
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:13,304
[SPEAKER_26]: There is a room for them to be separate.

264
00:21:13,344 --> 00:21:15,344
[SPEAKER_26]: There is a room for the person to take a rest.

265
00:21:15,404 --> 00:21:17,765
[SPEAKER_26]: There is a quiet room which is required to have.

266
00:21:18,145 --> 00:21:22,666
[SPEAKER_26]: We require to have a certain number of recliners, for example, for each participant.

267
00:21:23,426 --> 00:21:24,647
[SPEAKER_26]: And there are classrooms.

268
00:21:24,847 --> 00:21:32,209
[SPEAKER_26]: We provide English classes, book club classes where people can express themselves.

269
00:21:32,578 --> 00:21:41,502
[SPEAKER_26]: We usually employ a part-time music therapist who comes two to three times a week to provide some sort of activity which involves music.

270
00:21:42,662 --> 00:21:45,523
[SPEAKER_03]: And just my last question, do you do any outreach at all?

271
00:21:46,844 --> 00:21:47,324
[SPEAKER_26]: Right now?

272
00:21:47,864 --> 00:21:50,826
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, once you get started, if someone is a client.

273
00:21:50,846 --> 00:21:59,009
[SPEAKER_26]: Of course, we will work with the local health care centers, we will work with the doctors, and definitely with the Mystic Valley.

274
00:22:00,249 --> 00:22:00,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Mystic Valley?

275
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:01,270
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

276
00:22:02,838 --> 00:22:13,824
[SPEAKER_25]: And Mr. Marks, there is a schematic in your package which shows the breakdown of where the rooms and what types of rooms you will be in addition to that.

277
00:22:13,844 --> 00:22:16,905
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. Are you all set?

278
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:19,046
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for those insightful questions.

279
00:22:19,387 --> 00:22:19,987
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Knight.

280
00:22:20,587 --> 00:22:21,788
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

281
00:22:21,808 --> 00:22:22,768
[SPEAKER_15]: Just a couple of questions.

282
00:22:23,449 --> 00:22:25,370
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, you say this is a community based service.

283
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:27,811
[SPEAKER_15]: What communities do you service Medford?

284
00:22:28,804 --> 00:22:33,629
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a region, several cities in town?

285
00:22:56,014 --> 00:22:59,816
[SPEAKER_15]: How many full-time and part-time jobs is this business going to bring to the city?

286
00:23:00,397 --> 00:23:04,499
[SPEAKER_20]: Usually, we should have a license of about 100 clients.

287
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:13,264
[SPEAKER_20]: It's altogether full-time and part-time, and it's between 25 to 30 people.

288
00:23:13,284 --> 00:23:13,564
[SPEAKER_15]: 25 to 30?

289
00:23:14,384 --> 00:23:16,486
[SPEAKER_15]: And what's the breakdown in terms of part-time and full-time?

290
00:23:16,506 --> 00:23:19,968
[SPEAKER_20]: I would say 70-30, 70-30% is full-time, 70-30% is part-time.

291
00:23:22,927 --> 00:23:23,087
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

292
00:23:23,548 --> 00:23:27,691
[SPEAKER_15]: And do you have a specific number of slots of your hundred reserved for metric residents?

293
00:23:27,751 --> 00:23:35,697
[SPEAKER_20]: Are there any type of quarter requirements that you might be?

294
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:37,939
[SPEAKER_16]: Excellent.

295
00:23:38,259 --> 00:23:38,479
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

296
00:23:38,499 --> 00:23:38,960
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much.

297
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:39,420
[SPEAKER_16]: Appreciate it.

298
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,041
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

299
00:23:40,081 --> 00:23:42,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Knight on the motion of Oh, console.

300
00:23:42,423 --> 00:23:42,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

301
00:23:42,743 --> 00:23:43,784
[SPEAKER_02]: One more question.

302
00:23:43,804 --> 00:23:45,405
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm familiar with the building.

303
00:23:45,525 --> 00:23:46,606
[SPEAKER_02]: What floor are you going to be on in there?

304
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:48,467
[SPEAKER_26]: First, we are in the first, you got to take over.

305
00:23:48,487 --> 00:23:51,049
[SPEAKER_26]: You got to take over the whole first floor of the ground level.

306
00:23:51,089 --> 00:23:51,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

307
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:51,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

308
00:23:52,618 --> 00:23:53,378
[SPEAKER_02]: And one more thing.

309
00:23:56,619 --> 00:23:57,740
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you said you take insurance.

310
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,720
[SPEAKER_02]: What about people who don't have insurance?

311
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:04,622
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a possibility of the private pay, but we usually don't— I mean, people that don't have the ability to pay.

312
00:24:05,602 --> 00:24:06,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Will people get turned away?

313
00:24:07,223 --> 00:24:14,885
[SPEAKER_26]: Historically, we, in each of our centers, have a certain number of pro bono cases, but this is just that we give back to the community.

314
00:24:16,165 --> 00:24:21,787
[SPEAKER_26]: Sometimes Mystic Valley provide the—or similar organizations find the resources.

315
00:24:22,219 --> 00:24:25,400
[SPEAKER_26]: However, we do provide, in each of the centers, we do have several people.

316
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:32,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I know not all senior health insurances can go to your place and go to places that are similar to yours.

317
00:24:33,284 --> 00:24:35,685
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, MassHealth covers this, which is a big insurance.

318
00:24:35,705 --> 00:24:37,286
[SPEAKER_02]: But not everybody's on MassHealth either.

319
00:24:37,346 --> 00:24:39,306
[SPEAKER_26]: Long-term care insurance covers this.

320
00:24:39,807 --> 00:24:43,308
[SPEAKER_26]: Blue Cross covers this, actually, even as a secondary.

321
00:24:44,068 --> 00:24:46,950
[SPEAKER_26]: And then the private insurances, some of them covers this.

322
00:24:48,991 --> 00:24:51,952
[SPEAKER_28]: I would like to see some kind of provision made for people

323
00:24:52,662 --> 00:24:53,482
[SPEAKER_28]: don't have the means to pay.

324
00:24:53,502 --> 00:24:53,582
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.

325
00:25:00,406 --> 00:25:01,006
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

326
00:25:01,026 --> 00:25:08,930
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, Councilor Caraviello, the motion of approval by a Councilor Camuso as amended by Councilor, uh, Penter and seconded by Councilor Knight, Councilor Penter.

327
00:25:09,471 --> 00:25:10,111
[SPEAKER_11]: Two quick questions.

328
00:25:10,311 --> 00:25:15,594
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, for people who might be watching, can you tell them where one-on-one Mr. Gav, what's that one-on-one Mr. Gav right now?

329
00:25:17,376 --> 00:25:20,598
[SPEAKER_20]: I live right across from, I believe, the BMW.

330
00:25:20,638 --> 00:25:23,781
[SPEAKER_20]: Literally right across.

331
00:25:24,621 --> 00:25:24,962
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

332
00:25:26,062 --> 00:25:28,144
[SPEAKER_11]: And you indicated you could serve as 100 clients.

333
00:25:28,204 --> 00:25:30,226
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that on the spot, or that during the course of the?

334
00:25:30,426 --> 00:25:33,548
[SPEAKER_11]: How many can you actually have on that location at one time?

335
00:25:33,568 --> 00:25:35,309
[SPEAKER_11]: About 100.

336
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:36,730
[SPEAKER_11]: You could have 100 people.

337
00:25:37,291 --> 00:25:41,374
[SPEAKER_11]: So your 25 to 30 people could handle 100 people at any one time?

338
00:25:41,634 --> 00:25:41,774
Yes.

339
00:25:42,775 --> 00:25:44,036
[SPEAKER_11]: No matter what their problems might be.

340
00:25:45,456 --> 00:25:50,161
[SPEAKER_11]: So if anyone has probably a somewhat of a psychiatric type of a problem, you can handle that?

341
00:25:51,122 --> 00:25:56,247
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, but we do provide service for people with behavioral problems and with mental health problems.

342
00:25:56,267 --> 00:25:58,229
[SPEAKER_26]: However, we are not a psychiatric facility.

343
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,152
[SPEAKER_11]: But how are you supposed to know that if somebody wants to apply?

344
00:26:01,699 --> 00:26:04,340
[SPEAKER_26]: And this is all regulated by state, by state regulation as to the number of, you know,

345
00:26:20,984 --> 00:26:24,967
[SPEAKER_11]: But this is for the purposes of anyone who might be watching so they have a better understanding.

346
00:26:24,987 --> 00:26:27,529
[SPEAKER_18]: So there are limitations then, if I could clarify.

347
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:32,133
[SPEAKER_18]: Limitations or admission criteria for people to come in.

348
00:26:32,153 --> 00:26:32,833
[SPEAKER_26]: For insurance purposes.

349
00:26:32,853 --> 00:26:35,155
[SPEAKER_26]: Insurance would cover it, not for us.

350
00:26:35,335 --> 00:26:40,980
[SPEAKER_26]: In order for insurance to cover it, there has to be a need with the help of the aids of daily living.

351
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:49,686
[SPEAKER_26]: But if we have a physician order and it's up to the person's physician to say this person would benefit, a lot of times

352
00:26:51,113 --> 00:26:54,034
[SPEAKER_26]: We take people who otherwise would be prone to isolation.

353
00:26:56,755 --> 00:26:57,215
[SPEAKER_19]: Very good.

354
00:26:57,475 --> 00:27:01,076
[SPEAKER_20]: But on a regular basis, we receive the physician's summary from the doctor.

355
00:27:01,496 --> 00:27:08,198
[SPEAKER_20]: Based on that, we evaluate our nursing staff, evaluate the patient, and then create a so-called care plan.

356
00:27:08,778 --> 00:27:14,160
[SPEAKER_20]: Based on the care plan, all disciplines in the office act on our behalf.

357
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:20,482
[SPEAKER_26]: There are three medical professionals who sees that patient, and it's a nurse from the Mystic Valley,

358
00:27:20,976 --> 00:27:24,937
[SPEAKER_26]: There is a primary care physician and there is a nurse from the adult day health center.

359
00:27:25,417 --> 00:27:25,837
[SPEAKER_18]: Very good.

360
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:26,798
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

361
00:27:26,958 --> 00:27:27,558
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Penter.

362
00:27:27,618 --> 00:27:28,798
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that helpful?

363
00:27:29,118 --> 00:27:37,821
[SPEAKER_18]: Then on the motion for approval by Councilor Penta amended by counts on the motion of approval by council Camuso amended by Councilor Penta seconded by Councilor Knight.

364
00:27:38,721 --> 00:27:42,122
[SPEAKER_18]: A role for roll call has been requested by council Camuso.

365
00:27:42,442 --> 00:27:43,982
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

366
00:27:44,362 --> 00:27:45,263
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Camuso.

367
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:45,563
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

368
00:27:46,043 --> 00:27:46,923
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Caraviello.

369
00:27:46,963 --> 00:27:47,103
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

370
00:27:47,563 --> 00:27:48,123
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Knight.

371
00:27:48,324 --> 00:27:48,424
Yes.

372
00:27:48,964 --> 00:27:49,884
[SPEAKER_19]: Vice-president Long and Kern.

373
00:27:50,572 --> 00:27:51,232
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Marks?

374
00:27:51,512 --> 00:27:51,752
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

375
00:27:52,112 --> 00:27:52,753
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Penta?

376
00:27:53,113 --> 00:27:53,253
Yes.

377
00:27:53,953 --> 00:27:54,773
[SPEAKER_19]: President Dello Russo?

378
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:55,633
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

379
00:27:55,873 --> 00:28:00,834
[SPEAKER_18]: On the vote, seven in favor, none in the negative.

380
00:28:00,954 --> 00:28:02,955
[SPEAKER_18]: The petition passes.

381
00:28:03,655 --> 00:28:04,515
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you very much.

382
00:28:04,535 --> 00:28:04,855
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

383
00:28:05,155 --> 00:28:06,476
[SPEAKER_20]: It was a pleasure serving this town.

384
00:28:06,756 --> 00:28:07,036
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

385
00:28:07,636 --> 00:28:07,996
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

386
00:28:10,277 --> 00:28:15,198
[SPEAKER_18]: Motions, orders, and resolutions offered by Councilor Penta.

387
00:28:15,938 --> 00:28:19,699
[SPEAKER_18]: Be it resolved that Medford Dentist, Dr. Lorenzo Lepore,

388
00:28:20,224 --> 00:28:36,520
[SPEAKER_18]: be congratulated for having his most important health and educational piece of legislation passed by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts regarding the sterilization and use of musical instruments within our educational school system by students for use.

389
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:37,961
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Penta.

390
00:28:38,501 --> 00:28:45,208
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, we all know that Dr. Lepore has an extreme interest in musical instruments because he plays one himself.

391
00:28:46,043 --> 00:28:58,666
[SPEAKER_11]: But he started on this adventure a few years ago up at the State House when he had a bill introduced by Representative Paul Donato as it relates to the sterilization of musical instruments in schools.

392
00:28:59,386 --> 00:29:06,808
[SPEAKER_11]: The bill, as reported out and signed by the governor on his last day in office, number 4384, states the following.

393
00:29:07,588 --> 00:29:14,370
[SPEAKER_11]: Upon the issuance of a musical wind instrument to a borrowing student attending grades pre-kindergarten through 12 and any public

394
00:29:15,077 --> 00:29:31,408
[SPEAKER_11]: or commonwealth charter school, the issuing school shall inform the parent or guardian of the student that while the musical wind instrument was sanitized, it may also be sterilized in order to ensure that all microbiome life has been eradicated within the instrument.

395
00:29:31,949 --> 00:29:44,197
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, we all know that there was a tremendous amount of concern as it relates to using pieces of instruments that children use in the public schools or charter schools

396
00:29:44,619 --> 00:29:45,879
[SPEAKER_11]: or public school administration.

397
00:29:47,860 --> 00:30:13,507
[SPEAKER_11]: Through Tufts University, its medical school, and a whole host of medical individuals, the Federal Food and Drug Administration became very supportive once they recognized the fact that this has a legitimate concern, where they wrote, quote, we recognize that with respect to cross-contamination risks and the associated microbiological implications, musical wind instruments

398
00:30:13,971 --> 00:30:17,092
[SPEAKER_11]: are not unlike other contaminated medical dental devices.

399
00:30:17,772 --> 00:30:28,074
[SPEAKER_11]: It states that a valid public health issue consistent with the universal precautions adhere to in the medical dental settings relative to instruments contaminated with bodily fluids.

400
00:30:28,254 --> 00:30:43,258
[SPEAKER_11]: And as such, this agency, which is the FDA, believes that the classification of sterilized musical wind instruments falls under the jurisdiction of the Environmental Protection Agency and is simply concurring with the conventional medical wisdom that sterilizing items

401
00:30:43,678 --> 00:30:47,219
[SPEAKER_11]: contaminated with body fluids between uses is inappropriate.

402
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:58,104
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, we all know that if you went to a restaurant, it would be absolutely inappropriate to use somebody else's fork, spoon, or drink from their glass because there are strict sterilization issues.

403
00:30:58,624 --> 00:31:03,806
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the same thing you tell your kids not to use somebody else's toothbrush other than their own.

404
00:31:05,607 --> 00:31:13,030
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can go and you can start making all these analogies as it relates to the misuse or the abuse that somebody might find themselves in.

405
00:31:13,567 --> 00:31:25,109
[SPEAKER_11]: because of the fact that something either wasn't sterilized or it wasn't brought to the parental attention for the purposes of letting them know that their children, to be safe, needs to have this stuff sterilized.

406
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:30,170
[SPEAKER_11]: Restaurants and hospitals follow strict public health rules and regulations and standards.

407
00:31:31,011 --> 00:31:38,852
[SPEAKER_11]: And this was a long journey because it was sort of like virgin in the territories of people who just didn't understand this.

408
00:31:39,252 --> 00:31:41,973
[SPEAKER_11]: Some 25 years ago, you would never think of going to a dentist.

409
00:31:42,886 --> 00:31:47,729
[SPEAKER_11]: so to speak, and he or she would put their fingers in your mouth without gloves.

410
00:31:47,789 --> 00:32:03,600
[SPEAKER_11]: And ever since the fact that they now wear gloves, you would come to your attention immediately if you went to a dentist, male or female, and they decided to stick their finger in your mouth without a sterilized, whatever the color might be of the glove that they have to wear.

411
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,301
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a real big issue.

412
00:32:06,501 --> 00:32:07,522
[SPEAKER_11]: This isn't a requirement.

413
00:32:07,542 --> 00:32:08,723
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a voluntarily

414
00:32:09,913 --> 00:32:18,879
[SPEAKER_11]: encounter that a parent will have now with their child who decides to want to use this instrument, or whatever the wind instrument might be.

415
00:32:18,899 --> 00:32:32,327
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it was some two to three summers ago, there was a story in the Boston Globe that identified some 30,000 pieces of wind instruments being stored in the Boston public schools.

416
00:32:32,427 --> 00:32:39,372
[SPEAKER_11]: And as a result of that, having not been used for years, and as a result of that, and having the microbiological

417
00:32:40,505 --> 00:32:52,667
[SPEAKER_11]: factor come into play, showing that the danger that these kids would have by blowing these instruments is something that basically, again, accelerated not only Dr. Lepore's interest in this, but also the state legislature.

418
00:32:53,408 --> 00:33:06,290
[SPEAKER_11]: And I have to say publicly, if it wasn't for Representative Donato leading the charge in this on Beacon Hill, fighting this and introducing it each and every year for the last, I believe, four years up at the Statehouse for the purposes of educating

419
00:33:06,697 --> 00:33:22,648
[SPEAKER_11]: his fellow lawmakers, and having the governor not only accept it when he first came on, he authorized a, strike that, he entertained a commission for the purpose of not only reviewing it, but they wrote a report in 100% support of it.

420
00:33:23,128 --> 00:33:34,516
[SPEAKER_11]: So, what I'd like to do, Mr. President, I'd like to invite Dr. Lepore to come here, and I think it would be a great acknowledgement to, again, one of our own, you know, kind of like Fortunate, we have it in the medical field,

421
00:33:34,862 --> 00:33:35,922
[SPEAKER_11]: We have it in the legal field.

422
00:33:35,963 --> 00:33:46,027
[SPEAKER_11]: Most recently, we have Victor Garrow, who received a nationwide award for his position of taking on a case for 30 years and defending somebody, proving that the gentleman was innocent and not guilty.

423
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:58,653
[SPEAKER_11]: And here we have another situation here where we have a renowned dentist here in our community who also happens to be a gentleman who plays a wind instrument, who saw the need for this to happen.

424
00:33:59,033 --> 00:34:01,714
[SPEAKER_11]: He saw the need for parents to be advised and become prepared.

425
00:34:02,222 --> 00:34:13,868
[SPEAKER_11]: And he also saw the fact that an infectious disease, which is at the core of this whole thing, this is a prevention of infectious diseases, could be taking place and be corrected.

426
00:34:14,188 --> 00:34:22,932
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's a good thing for not only the city of Met, but for the entire Commonwealth of Massachusetts and anyone who wants to believe in the fact that, you know, this is a good, it's a good bill.

427
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:31,216
[SPEAKER_11]: So with that being said, I move, Mr. President, that Dr. Lepore be invited to come at a future date and he be duly recognized for the

428
00:34:31,747 --> 00:34:32,628
[SPEAKER_11]: having the bill passed.

429
00:34:32,688 --> 00:34:38,893
[SPEAKER_11]: And you know something, I might even want to invite Representative Donato here, too, because this wasn't one of those easy bills that you can just get through.

430
00:34:38,913 --> 00:34:44,798
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of people sometimes couldn't understand it, don't understand the medical part of it, and you have a lot of new reps coming and going.

431
00:34:44,858 --> 00:34:47,500
[SPEAKER_11]: So it took some time for the purposes of having this happen.

432
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,420
[SPEAKER_11]: And you had some opposition.

433
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:48,901
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, there was.

434
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:49,822
[SPEAKER_11]: I found it.

435
00:34:50,442 --> 00:34:54,806
[SPEAKER_11]: But he worked himself through it, and the legislature finally, and the governor.

436
00:34:54,946 --> 00:35:00,230
[SPEAKER_11]: The governor was on board right from the beginning, but the legislature finally saw through it, and it finally got itself passed.

437
00:35:01,056 --> 00:35:02,737
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, that's a beautiful resolution.

438
00:35:03,177 --> 00:35:07,480
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion for approval by Councilor Penta, seconded by Councilor Musil.

439
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:08,581
[SPEAKER_18]: All those in favor?

440
00:35:08,941 --> 00:35:10,942
[SPEAKER_18]: All those opposed?

441
00:35:12,303 --> 00:35:14,424
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion passes.

442
00:35:14,444 --> 00:35:15,685
[SPEAKER_18]: 15-022, offered by Councilor Penta.

443
00:35:16,145 --> 00:35:29,674
[SPEAKER_18]: Be it resolved that the Mayor's ongoing new parking revenue enhancement program be further discussed regarding inequity and location positions on paid-to-park kiosks, as well as corollary issues

444
00:35:30,067 --> 00:35:31,827
[SPEAKER_18]: associated with this program.

445
00:35:32,328 --> 00:35:33,528
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Penta.

446
00:35:33,588 --> 00:35:42,790
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, last week we had a, once again for the second week in a row, this is now running ourselves into the third week as it relates to this parking program that the mayor has initiated.

447
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:54,613
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think it's time we get a few issues straight right from the beginning because I don't want any misrepresentation to go out there before we get into our discussion as it relates to just what the council's position is on this.

448
00:35:55,273 --> 00:35:58,334
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Camuso, you made some comments relative or earlier,

449
00:35:58,785 --> 00:36:06,213
[SPEAKER_11]: that the council, on other occasions prior to this, voted, I believe you said, for a revenue, for a program.

450
00:36:06,233 --> 00:36:08,655
[SPEAKER_11]: What the council voted for... Can I, councillor?

451
00:36:08,775 --> 00:36:11,158
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I finish my position, please?

452
00:36:11,198 --> 00:36:12,639
[SPEAKER_18]: Point of information, Mr. President.

453
00:36:12,659 --> 00:36:14,942
[SPEAKER_18]: We have the councillor asking for a point of information.

454
00:36:14,962 --> 00:36:15,202
[SPEAKER_18]: Go ahead.

455
00:36:15,222 --> 00:36:17,845
[SPEAKER_18]: And if I just might kindly recommend for the

456
00:36:18,852 --> 00:36:35,960
[SPEAKER_18]: uh, efficacy of our deliberations tonight that, uh, perhaps we allow a more neutral party to, um, clarify that matter as far as the votes and, uh, maybe then we'll be more satisfied rather than, uh, uh, two sides trying to argue contravening points.

457
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,221
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think it's a matter of point of information.

458
00:36:40,261 --> 00:36:41,102
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Camuso.

459
00:36:42,682 --> 00:36:43,503
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it, um,

460
00:36:45,201 --> 00:36:49,262
[SPEAKER_09]: The gentleman said it a little bit differently than I stated it earlier.

461
00:36:50,442 --> 00:36:59,245
[SPEAKER_09]: All the votes in motions that were put before this Medford City Council, that were put before this Medford City Council, were unanimous votes.

462
00:36:59,625 --> 00:37:08,667
[SPEAKER_09]: Now I understand what the council is talking about, the final vote that we asked for to come back to this council, but the mayor, under his authority, didn't need to do that.

463
00:37:10,587 --> 00:37:12,048
[SPEAKER_09]: But we are unanimous.

464
00:37:12,669 --> 00:37:14,770
[SPEAKER_09]: We were unanimous on the two votes that were taken.

465
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:21,175
[SPEAKER_09]: And the two that this council took were one given the mayor the authority, which was a seven to zero vote.

466
00:37:21,916 --> 00:37:26,319
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the other vote was the night of the RFP or RFQ.

467
00:37:26,359 --> 00:37:34,425
[SPEAKER_09]: I forget exactly what it was, but we went over the language of the contract for a couple hours over here back, and I believe it was March of 2014.

468
00:37:35,706 --> 00:37:38,308
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was a seven zero vote to report it out of committee.

469
00:37:39,026 --> 00:37:39,326
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

470
00:37:39,386 --> 00:37:47,151
[SPEAKER_18]: And you've made your point of information and I'd kindly request that we keep our points of information to a sentence that's rather direct.

471
00:37:47,191 --> 00:37:55,756
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, continuing on those votes at the council took all the council was for a traffic enforcement, not a revenue enhancement program.

472
00:37:55,796 --> 00:38:00,759
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think the records will verify that, but let's get right to the crux of the matter.

473
00:38:00,959 --> 00:38:06,582
[SPEAKER_11]: On May 20th on May 20th of this past year, we received a letter from the

474
00:38:07,637 --> 00:38:15,602
[SPEAKER_11]: to the president of the council from the mayor, but basically said that the parking management program, the authority intend to an agreement exceeding three years.

475
00:38:16,082 --> 00:38:25,067
[SPEAKER_11]: Dear Mr. President, members of the council, the city of Medford has received proposals from various vendors in response to our request for proposals for a parking management program.

476
00:38:25,508 --> 00:38:34,713
[SPEAKER_11]: It is the intention of the city to enter a 10 year agreement with the successful proposal pursuant to the site and section of the law approved for the contract that exceeds three years.

477
00:38:35,726 --> 00:38:52,869
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, following that step further, the mayor indicated that I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body, pursuant to the provisions of Massachusetts General Law Chapter 30, Section B12, approve and authorize the city of Medford to enter into an agreement with the successful proposal for a term signed by the mayor.

478
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:58,211
[SPEAKER_11]: And at that council meeting on the 20th, those that spoke were Mr. Rumley, Mr. Stirella, and Mr. D'Antonio.

479
00:38:58,971 --> 00:39:01,831
[SPEAKER_11]: That resolution was amended by myself at the very end.

480
00:39:01,851 --> 00:39:04,872
[SPEAKER_11]: It states, amended by Councilor Penta, that the mayor

481
00:39:05,807 --> 00:39:11,911
[SPEAKER_11]: and the preferred vendor meeting with the council to explain the program in depth prior to the final decision.

482
00:39:12,531 --> 00:39:18,254
[SPEAKER_11]: But upon further review of the tape of that particular meeting, that was not the amendment.

483
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:19,875
[SPEAKER_11]: The amendment was as follows.

484
00:39:20,115 --> 00:39:26,419
[SPEAKER_11]: It was to amend the motion that the council meet before the signing so that we have a complete understanding.

485
00:39:27,059 --> 00:39:33,743
[SPEAKER_11]: So as amended, that having the mayor, whoever the vendor might be, present themselves before the council

486
00:39:34,127 --> 00:39:38,910
[SPEAKER_11]: before the finalization of the contract, before the finalization of the contract.

487
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:44,653
[SPEAKER_11]: So why would the mayor want to, why would somebody want to come here before it was finalized?

488
00:39:44,733 --> 00:39:46,134
[SPEAKER_11]: If in fact the mayor was going to sign it.

489
00:39:46,394 --> 00:39:49,616
[SPEAKER_11]: Now we met on September 10th at a committee of the whole meeting.

490
00:39:49,856 --> 00:39:59,142
[SPEAKER_11]: And at that point in time, there was business folks that and Councilors that pushed back from the contract that was being presented to us at that time from the people who were there.

491
00:39:59,862 --> 00:40:00,903
[SPEAKER_11]: And at that point in time,

492
00:40:01,515 --> 00:40:07,618
[SPEAKER_11]: The mayor decided to listen to all the things, left the room, and said he would come back with further.

493
00:40:08,098 --> 00:40:16,482
[SPEAKER_11]: And when he came back further was with no vote by the council to discuss what took place by way of an amendment or by way of extras or what have you.

494
00:40:17,502 --> 00:40:27,447
[SPEAKER_11]: As a result of that, there's been some, I guess, misinformation being scuttled out there as it relates to just does where this Medford City Council stand.

495
00:40:28,707 --> 00:40:32,870
[SPEAKER_11]: This Medford City Council had two proposals that took place on that May 20th.

496
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:44,317
[SPEAKER_11]: On that May 20th, we had A, we'd bring in one of the three vendors, for which it happened to be Republic, and B, we would get a report back if the city was to do it on its own with the financial breakdown.

497
00:40:44,837 --> 00:40:47,119
[SPEAKER_11]: We never had an opportunity to vote on that one way or the other.

498
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:56,005
[SPEAKER_11]: The council's position, other than the fact, saying that the mayor has the authority to sign it, he does have the authority to sign it, but we never had the finalization of what was being presented to us.

499
00:40:56,757 --> 00:40:58,678
[SPEAKER_11]: So what I'm offering here right now is the following.

500
00:40:59,158 --> 00:41:08,860
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a resolution that the Medford City Council take their official position as to whether they support Mayor McGlynn's pay-to-park kiosk revenue enhancement program with the Republic Company from Tennessee.

501
00:41:09,461 --> 00:41:10,081
[SPEAKER_11]: Very simple.

502
00:41:10,361 --> 00:41:15,242
[SPEAKER_11]: Either you're for it or you're against it so people have a clear understanding of where we all are.

503
00:41:15,282 --> 00:41:19,123
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't one week turn around and say you're for it and another week you're against it.

504
00:41:19,363 --> 00:41:24,505
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't want to hear from Councilor Caraviello calling me up and telling me that the people are saying that I'm saying something about him.

505
00:41:24,897 --> 00:41:25,538
[SPEAKER_11]: vice versa.

506
00:41:25,778 --> 00:41:26,598
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't go that way.

507
00:41:26,658 --> 00:41:31,762
[SPEAKER_11]: My comments have been pretty consistent and I'll say that in front of anyone that wants to challenge me to what I say.

508
00:41:32,203 --> 00:41:33,184
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the resolution.

509
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:34,645
[SPEAKER_11]: There it is, Mr. Clerk.

510
00:41:34,885 --> 00:41:37,967
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to have the council vote on it and then we can continue on talking about it.

511
00:41:39,849 --> 00:41:41,870
[SPEAKER_09]: Point of information, Councilor Camuso.

512
00:41:42,391 --> 00:41:44,893
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just have one question for the councilor.

513
00:41:45,373 --> 00:41:45,793
[SPEAKER_09]: So the

514
00:41:46,874 --> 00:41:52,697
[SPEAKER_09]: request for proposal that originally went out that you voted on, you didn't know what was in that contract when you took that vote.

515
00:41:52,997 --> 00:41:54,918
[SPEAKER_11]: Just for the clarification... Took what vote, Mr. Paul?

516
00:41:54,938 --> 00:41:55,718
[SPEAKER_11]: We didn't have no vote.

517
00:41:55,738 --> 00:42:04,142
[SPEAKER_09]: We had a vote back in March, I think it was March, when we sat at the committee of the whole and went over the request for proposal before Louise Miller put it out.

518
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:05,903
[SPEAKER_09]: Before she put it out.

519
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:09,645
[SPEAKER_09]: The records... Mr. Dello Russo, I'm council president.

520
00:42:09,885 --> 00:42:10,145
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, sir.

521
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:12,706
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you made a very good solution before.

522
00:42:13,747 --> 00:42:15,988
[SPEAKER_09]: The city clerk is the official record keeper of the community.

523
00:42:17,514 --> 00:42:26,801
[SPEAKER_09]: Please give us the votes, Mr. Clerk, on the meeting for the request for proposal that originally went out, and then for giving the mayor the 10 years authority.

524
00:42:27,121 --> 00:42:28,242
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of clarification.

525
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:32,931
[SPEAKER_11]: what the council voted for, seven to nothing, and I will agree to that, because that's what I voted on.

526
00:42:33,031 --> 00:42:37,612
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I, to allow him to go forward and to negotiate with Republicans.

527
00:42:37,712 --> 00:42:44,073
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I wanted to do, and report back to the council before it was finalized for us to review it.

528
00:42:44,093 --> 00:42:45,754
[SPEAKER_09]: That never, ever took place.

529
00:42:45,834 --> 00:42:48,174
[SPEAKER_09]: There's two different meetings that took place.

530
00:42:48,234 --> 00:42:53,815
[SPEAKER_09]: The council is trying to make it look, because he wants to make it look like he took one vote this way, that way, whatever.

531
00:42:53,835 --> 00:42:54,936
[SPEAKER_09]: No he didn't, I'm not taking it.

532
00:42:54,956 --> 00:42:56,976
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a seven to nothing vote,

533
00:42:58,183 --> 00:43:01,786
[SPEAKER_09]: to send out the request for proposal to the vendors.

534
00:43:02,687 --> 00:43:03,748
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'm not arguing with that.

535
00:43:04,429 --> 00:43:07,792
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you now want to change the whole program, I'm not saying that.

536
00:43:07,832 --> 00:43:11,336
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm talking about the meeting that took place on May 20th.

537
00:43:11,436 --> 00:43:17,261
[SPEAKER_11]: To get those three vendors to come back, to get those three vendors to come back, you had to send the request out.

538
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:19,824
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilman, you knew it was in the contract.

539
00:43:19,844 --> 00:43:20,364
[SPEAKER_09]: You know something?

540
00:43:20,384 --> 00:43:21,425
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't know it was in the contract.

541
00:43:21,445 --> 00:43:21,986
[SPEAKER_09]: Neither did you.

542
00:43:22,206 --> 00:43:25,870
[SPEAKER_11]: You didn't even know about it until September 10th, when you got it for the first time.

543
00:43:26,231 --> 00:43:26,311
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

544
00:43:26,351 --> 00:43:26,932
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, you did.

545
00:43:27,092 --> 00:43:29,274
[SPEAKER_09]: The request for proposal went out back in March.

546
00:43:29,555 --> 00:43:31,076
[SPEAKER_09]: So like I said, you know something, Councilman?

547
00:43:31,096 --> 00:43:31,757
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a request for proposal.

548
00:43:31,977 --> 00:43:32,598
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not the contract.

549
00:43:32,618 --> 00:43:33,199
[SPEAKER_09]: With all due respect.

550
00:43:33,639 --> 00:43:37,502
[SPEAKER_09]: With all due respect, I've been watching this for longer than before I was on the council.

551
00:43:38,402 --> 00:43:39,843
[SPEAKER_09]: You fought something, then you're against it.

552
00:43:39,883 --> 00:43:41,164
[SPEAKER_09]: You just like to make steam.

553
00:43:41,384 --> 00:43:43,406
[SPEAKER_09]: You never let the truth get in the way of a good story.

554
00:43:43,426 --> 00:43:44,366
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait a minute, wait a minute.

555
00:43:44,406 --> 00:43:46,628
[SPEAKER_09]: The only one making steam right now is you.

556
00:43:46,688 --> 00:43:48,529
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, Mr. President.

557
00:43:48,549 --> 00:43:50,291
[SPEAKER_11]: I move the question, Mr. President, please.

558
00:43:50,311 --> 00:43:50,871
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President.

559
00:43:50,951 --> 00:43:54,113
[SPEAKER_18]: This resolution that's presented to you, Councilman.

560
00:43:54,293 --> 00:43:55,894
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm asking for the clerk.

561
00:43:56,515 --> 00:43:57,175
[SPEAKER_18]: We're on O22.

562
00:43:57,275 --> 00:43:58,856
[SPEAKER_18]: Right, and that's coming out of that resolution.

563
00:43:59,877 --> 00:44:01,780
[SPEAKER_18]: That's coming out of their resolution.

564
00:44:02,081 --> 00:44:08,732
[SPEAKER_18]: So if you could present that as a resolution for the next agenda through the City Messenger.

565
00:44:09,273 --> 00:44:10,335
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's do this one first.

566
00:44:11,196 --> 00:44:11,897
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we have 022 before us.

567
00:44:14,567 --> 00:44:17,328
[SPEAKER_11]: I am taking out of my resolution.

568
00:44:17,768 --> 00:44:20,428
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm filing this motion out of my resolution.

569
00:44:21,128 --> 00:44:22,968
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's an amendment to your resolution.

570
00:44:23,008 --> 00:44:23,249
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

571
00:44:23,429 --> 00:44:24,469
[SPEAKER_18]: If you want to call it amendment.

572
00:44:24,729 --> 00:44:26,009
[SPEAKER_18]: So then, so we're going to vote.

573
00:44:26,769 --> 00:44:30,430
[SPEAKER_18]: So then we're going to dispose of old 22 as amended.

574
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:43,812
[SPEAKER_18]: And it is amended that the Medford city council take an official position as to whether they support mayor McGlynn's paid to park kiosk revenue enhancement program

575
00:44:44,316 --> 00:44:46,577
[SPEAKER_18]: with the Republic company from Tennessee.

576
00:44:48,757 --> 00:44:51,358
[SPEAKER_18]: That's an amendment to item number 15022.

577
00:44:51,398 --> 00:44:56,300
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Camuso, did you want to amend?

578
00:44:56,420 --> 00:45:03,062
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to get the, I'd like for the clerk for once and for all, because I know for a fact Councilor Penta has given misinformation out there.

579
00:45:03,102 --> 00:45:06,043
[SPEAKER_23]: That's absolutely not true.

580
00:45:06,183 --> 00:45:10,484
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like to allow the clerk to give clarification on the two votes that the Medford city council took.

581
00:45:10,764 --> 00:45:15,007
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like to do that right now, and then we can put this to sleep, and you won't have to deal with counsel.

582
00:45:15,027 --> 00:45:16,308
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of clarification.

583
00:45:16,348 --> 00:45:16,949
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait a minute.

584
00:45:17,049 --> 00:45:18,350
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not arguing that we didn't.

585
00:45:18,370 --> 00:45:19,030
[SPEAKER_11]: We took the vote.

586
00:45:19,390 --> 00:45:24,314
[SPEAKER_11]: We all took the vote to go out for an RFP, and we all took the vote for the mayor to go forward.

587
00:45:24,334 --> 00:45:27,156
[SPEAKER_11]: We never took a final vote, as you voted for.

588
00:45:27,376 --> 00:45:32,780
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Penta, Councilor Camuso, the clerk will need time to resolve this by way of research.

589
00:45:33,321 --> 00:45:36,422
[SPEAKER_18]: So that will be an amendment to the motion before us.

590
00:45:36,602 --> 00:45:41,464
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to use the word duped.

591
00:45:41,804 --> 00:45:47,186
[SPEAKER_09]: The contract called that we put our vote behind.

592
00:45:48,886 --> 00:45:53,328
[SPEAKER_09]: But at this point to say that we were totally against it and this and that

593
00:45:54,428 --> 00:45:56,529
[SPEAKER_09]: up until the final plan that the mayor would... Who's saying that?

594
00:45:56,869 --> 00:45:58,090
[SPEAKER_09]: Nobody's saying that, Paul.

595
00:45:58,330 --> 00:46:00,451
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President... The resolution's very simple.

596
00:46:00,612 --> 00:46:01,472
[SPEAKER_09]: Either you're for it or against it.

597
00:46:01,492 --> 00:46:02,613
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not talking about your resolution.

598
00:46:03,253 --> 00:46:03,973
[SPEAKER_09]: For or against it.

599
00:46:04,494 --> 00:46:08,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor, it's so convoluted, what you're trying to do... And your mind is convoluted.

600
00:46:08,716 --> 00:46:10,557
[SPEAKER_09]: What you're trying to do here is... And your mind is convoluted.

601
00:46:10,597 --> 00:46:12,418
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor... I go by fact.

602
00:46:12,638 --> 00:46:14,439
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, I go by fact.

603
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:18,622
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd just like to see the records of the original votes and...

604
00:46:19,657 --> 00:46:20,917
[SPEAKER_09]: where it took us to this point.

605
00:46:21,177 --> 00:46:26,658
[SPEAKER_09]: Because there is, Councilor Caraviello, in conversations with him, has been approached by what, four or five people?

606
00:46:27,139 --> 00:46:28,299
[SPEAKER_09]: At least through this community.

607
00:46:28,599 --> 00:46:33,300
[SPEAKER_09]: I know someone that was sitting next to the councilor when he's saying that you can blame certain councilors for this.

608
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,760
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's, let's- Well, bring that person forward.

609
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:36,640
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor, they don't like you.

610
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:37,701
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't even want to talk to you.

611
00:46:38,141 --> 00:46:42,081
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the reason- So like I said, Mr. President- Well, ask Councilor Caraviello the question.

612
00:46:42,182 --> 00:46:44,502
[SPEAKER_11]: You even said you thought you were coming back to take a vote.

613
00:46:44,542 --> 00:46:45,322
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you not say that?

614
00:46:45,942 --> 00:46:47,022
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor- Thank you very much.

615
00:46:47,062 --> 00:46:47,903
[SPEAKER_11]: There he is right there.

616
00:46:47,923 --> 00:46:48,303
[SPEAKER_11]: He just-

617
00:46:50,604 --> 00:46:51,044
[SPEAKER_18]: He doesn't.

618
00:46:52,225 --> 00:46:52,565
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

619
00:46:52,625 --> 00:46:53,245
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilors.

620
00:46:53,325 --> 00:46:54,126
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Marks.

621
00:46:55,767 --> 00:46:56,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

622
00:46:57,468 --> 00:47:01,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, I, I don't think anyone behind this real disputes.

623
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:10,176
[SPEAKER_03]: The fact that this council has been pushing for years and I is one member for parking enforcement in this community.

624
00:47:10,776 --> 00:47:17,941
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think anyone disputes that how we arrived at that and where we are today is due to a plan that the mayor signed.

625
00:47:19,007 --> 00:47:20,288
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't dispute that either.

626
00:47:20,789 --> 00:47:21,869
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the mayor's plan.

627
00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:23,510
[SPEAKER_03]: He's the one that signed it.

628
00:47:24,251 --> 00:47:29,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the council did take several votes, but not on the language.

629
00:47:29,935 --> 00:47:35,919
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've heard members of the council already state, like Councilor Knight mentioned today, he's not happy with the $0.35 surcharge.

630
00:47:38,342 --> 00:47:43,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, at the time, was that an issue that was brought up, that we discussed, that we talked about, that we voted on?

631
00:47:44,184 --> 00:47:44,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely not.

632
00:47:45,324 --> 00:47:50,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Camuso said last week that he's against kiosks and prefers parking meters.

633
00:47:51,366 --> 00:47:53,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, was that an issue that we took a vote on?

634
00:47:54,107 --> 00:47:55,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely not.

635
00:47:55,387 --> 00:47:56,768
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was the length...

636
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:00,341
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in the records.

637
00:48:01,582 --> 00:48:02,522
[SPEAKER_09]: But not in the final plan.

638
00:48:02,542 --> 00:48:03,263
[SPEAKER_09]: I see what you're saying.

639
00:48:03,323 --> 00:48:04,704
[SPEAKER_03]: We did not take a vote.

640
00:48:04,804 --> 00:48:08,287
[SPEAKER_03]: And Mr. President, if you could indulge me for a moment.

641
00:48:08,307 --> 00:48:09,628
[SPEAKER_18]: Please, you have the floor, Councilor Mikes.

642
00:48:09,668 --> 00:48:09,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

643
00:48:10,008 --> 00:48:17,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's important that we get this information out and that the people at home and the people in the audience are aware, Mr. President.

644
00:48:18,035 --> 00:48:19,476
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not going to speak for anyone else.

645
00:48:20,257 --> 00:48:26,602
[SPEAKER_03]: I, as one member of the council, never voted to outsource this particular program.

646
00:48:27,382 --> 00:48:27,943
[SPEAKER_03]: If anything,

647
00:48:28,275 --> 00:48:34,184
[SPEAKER_03]: It was myself, Councilor Wong-Tam and Councilor Penta that pushed at the beginning to take this program in house.

648
00:48:34,545 --> 00:48:39,292
[SPEAKER_03]: We thought we could accomplish this in house by our own staff.

649
00:48:39,432 --> 00:48:42,036
[SPEAKER_03]: A unanimous vote by this Council, Councilor.

650
00:48:43,347 --> 00:48:44,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Kiosk versus meter.

651
00:48:45,248 --> 00:48:47,248
[SPEAKER_03]: I never took a vote on kiosk versus meter.

652
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:52,931
[SPEAKER_03]: When I sat on the committee back some five years ago, our mission was to look at other communities.

653
00:48:53,331 --> 00:48:57,572
[SPEAKER_03]: And our recommendation back to the mayor was, Mr. Mayor, we looked at other communities.

654
00:48:58,032 --> 00:49:02,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Boston uses a combination of kiosk and meters and other surrounding communities.

655
00:49:02,821 --> 00:49:06,484
[SPEAKER_03]: and their parking lots use kiosks and meters on the streets.

656
00:49:07,065 --> 00:49:10,888
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't make our declarative recommendation on which way to go.

657
00:49:11,209 --> 00:49:12,470
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the mayor's choice.

658
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:21,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we heard recently about raising business and commuter permit fees for permit parking from 100 to 400.

659
00:49:22,218 --> 00:49:27,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Did anyone behind this reeling vote to raise business or commuter fees

660
00:49:27,803 --> 00:49:29,944
[SPEAKER_03]: commuter permit parking from $100 to $400?

661
00:49:30,784 --> 00:49:32,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely not.

662
00:49:32,884 --> 00:49:33,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely not.

663
00:49:34,485 --> 00:49:34,825
[SPEAKER_03]: 7 a.m.

664
00:49:35,105 --> 00:49:36,005
[SPEAKER_03]: to 7 p.m.

665
00:49:36,125 --> 00:49:37,065
[SPEAKER_03]: on the paid-for parking.

666
00:49:37,546 --> 00:49:40,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Who voted behind the reeling to have it for 12 hours?

667
00:49:41,506 --> 00:49:41,887
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

668
00:49:42,007 --> 00:49:42,727
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't vote for it.

669
00:49:42,887 --> 00:49:45,047
[SPEAKER_03]: Did anyone else vote to have it for 12 hours?

670
00:49:45,427 --> 00:49:51,189
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we're hearing the concerns that people would like to see it less to help business out.

671
00:49:51,229 --> 00:49:53,609
[SPEAKER_03]: The $3 surcharge on resident permit parking.

672
00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:54,950
[SPEAKER_03]: Did we vote for that?

673
00:49:55,910 --> 00:50:05,772
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it was just the company just took it back now, knowing that on a $10 permit parking, resident permit parking, $3 is excessive, and they took it back on their own.

674
00:50:06,032 --> 00:50:06,832
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't vote for that.

675
00:50:07,232 --> 00:50:12,534
[SPEAKER_03]: The $0.35 surcharge to use the Park Mobile for your pay phone, we didn't vote for that.

676
00:50:13,114 --> 00:50:18,795
[SPEAKER_03]: The enforcement versus pay to park, we didn't vote for that, Mr. President.

677
00:50:19,544 --> 00:50:22,145
[SPEAKER_03]: able to support 30-minute free parking.

678
00:50:22,645 --> 00:50:23,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Did we get a vote on that?

679
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:24,505
[SPEAKER_03]: We all support that.

680
00:50:24,825 --> 00:50:27,306
[SPEAKER_03]: We've heard it mentioned, whether it's 15 or 30 minutes.

681
00:50:27,606 --> 00:50:29,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Every council said, I'd like to see that.

682
00:50:29,827 --> 00:50:34,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if every council likes to see that, and we're saying that we supported the mayor's proposal, why is it in there?

683
00:50:35,468 --> 00:50:36,629
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to know why it's in there.

684
00:50:36,789 --> 00:50:38,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we didn't vote on the language.

685
00:50:39,049 --> 00:50:41,110
[SPEAKER_03]: We did not vote on the language.

686
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:43,811
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can't say it enough, Mr. President.

687
00:50:44,071 --> 00:50:49,954
[SPEAKER_03]: The validation program, that was recently created a couple of weeks ago, and the mayor nixed it shortly after that.

688
00:50:51,495 --> 00:50:53,395
[SPEAKER_03]: The kiosk, where the kiosk are located.

689
00:50:53,816 --> 00:50:55,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Who voted on that behind this reeling?

690
00:50:55,957 --> 00:50:58,438
[SPEAKER_03]: We sat down and said, where the kiosk could be located?

691
00:50:58,918 --> 00:51:02,560
[SPEAKER_03]: That was under the mayor's plan, not under our vote, Mr. President.

692
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, keeping the appeal process.

693
00:51:06,181 --> 00:51:09,283
[SPEAKER_03]: The one thing that we didn't outsource was the appeal process.

694
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:18,668
[SPEAKER_03]: And everyone told us, and I know Gwen Blackburn's in the audience, and every city that we went to said, keep the appeal process out of City Hall, keep it away from City Hall.

695
00:51:18,948 --> 00:51:22,110
[SPEAKER_03]: The one thing that may have kept in City Hall was the appeal process.

696
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:24,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Did members of the council vote for that to keep it here?

697
00:51:25,152 --> 00:51:26,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely not, Mr. President.

698
00:51:27,853 --> 00:51:30,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, to post signs on trees.

699
00:51:31,195 --> 00:51:32,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that a vote of this council?

700
00:51:32,876 --> 00:51:36,378
[SPEAKER_03]: I personally know that it's against the city policy to do so.

701
00:51:37,299 --> 00:51:39,480
[SPEAKER_03]: That wasn't a vote of the Medford City Council.

702
00:51:41,075 --> 00:51:47,501
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Mr. President, I think what we have to be careful here is, you know, the mayor's a big boy.

703
00:51:47,861 --> 00:51:53,926
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the mayor's plan, and he should be able to come forward and say, this is what I thought was best for this community.

704
00:51:54,547 --> 00:52:02,314
[SPEAKER_03]: But to run and hide at a time when the residents of this community need direction, Mr. President, is incomprehensible.

705
00:52:03,375 --> 00:52:06,678
[SPEAKER_03]: It really is, Mr. President, whether he's on vacation or not.

706
00:52:07,754 --> 00:52:08,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor.

707
00:52:08,615 --> 00:52:10,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, just let me finish, Mr. President.

708
00:52:10,676 --> 00:52:17,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether he's on vacation or not, Mr. President, he's had ample opportunity to appear before the residents of this community.

709
00:52:17,321 --> 00:52:34,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether it's a reverse 911 call, whether it's on local access stations, whether it's not having a press conference, which he knows how to do very readily in his office, he has failed to appear before this council and the community and explain his pay-for-parking program.

710
00:52:36,047 --> 00:52:40,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, if he's in favor of it, he should get out there and push for it, Mr. President.

711
00:52:41,151 --> 00:52:46,236
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm not going to be tagged, Mr. President, because every inch of the way, I had questions on this.

712
00:52:46,596 --> 00:52:49,038
[SPEAKER_03]: And questions are still coming up, Mr. President.

713
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:59,667
[SPEAKER_03]: And for my vote from five years ago, back in 2009, along with the committee the mayor appointed, was to provide consistent parking enforcement in this community.

714
00:53:00,027 --> 00:53:03,610
[SPEAKER_03]: and not to go to a pay-for-parking program right away.

715
00:53:03,950 --> 00:53:06,432
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was my vote from day one, Mr. President.

716
00:53:06,753 --> 00:53:23,246
[SPEAKER_03]: And this has taken on, as a speaker said earlier, we went from a plan of small nature, just trying to improve enforcement and moving cars along, to a plan now where we're aggressively seeking out people and we're aggressively hurting

717
00:53:23,586 --> 00:53:25,368
[SPEAKER_03]: local business in this community, Mr. President.

718
00:53:25,388 --> 00:53:28,970
[SPEAKER_18]: As my neighbor so aptly said, we asked for a glass of water and got a tsunami.

719
00:53:30,472 --> 00:53:41,861
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want that to be, yes, the council did take several votes, Mr. President, but we had no meaningful dialogue or input to any of the language that was always under the mayor's purview.

720
00:53:42,221 --> 00:53:48,206
[SPEAKER_03]: And as we can see, the program being tweaked now is because of the lack of involvement in this community.

721
00:53:48,602 --> 00:53:57,228
[SPEAKER_03]: and we're paying the repercussions now on trying to figure out a program while we already signed a contract, and that's unfortunate.

722
00:53:57,508 --> 00:53:58,509
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

723
00:53:58,609 --> 00:53:59,949
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

724
00:54:00,610 --> 00:54:02,991
[SPEAKER_04]: I will yield to Mr. Stirella.

725
00:54:03,011 --> 00:54:06,074
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Councilor.

726
00:54:06,154 --> 00:54:09,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Stirella, if you could please kindly state your name and address for the record.

727
00:54:10,176 --> 00:54:10,737
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll do that.

728
00:54:12,198 --> 00:54:14,439
[SPEAKER_06]: John Stirella, 20 Metcalfe Street, Medford.

729
00:54:15,158 --> 00:54:22,785
[SPEAKER_06]: If I may, Mr. President, I have here a short review of the process, which has been taking place, by the way, over one year.

730
00:54:23,906 --> 00:54:29,951
[SPEAKER_06]: It started, contrary to what Councilor Camuso says, it started in January of 2014.

731
00:54:30,031 --> 00:54:32,373
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one year ago.

732
00:54:33,073 --> 00:54:34,394
[SPEAKER_06]: That's when this began.

733
00:54:34,615 --> 00:54:38,618
[SPEAKER_06]: At that time, the request for proposals, the RFP was put out.

734
00:54:39,279 --> 00:54:43,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that was available to all of these councils, and I assume you all read that.

735
00:54:44,604 --> 00:54:48,767
[SPEAKER_06]: That RFP is included in the final contract.

736
00:54:49,708 --> 00:54:55,213
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you saw the RFP, you knew one year ago what was going to be in a contract.

737
00:54:55,453 --> 00:54:56,634
[SPEAKER_06]: None of you can deny that.

738
00:54:57,634 --> 00:54:59,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Then in February, the proposals were due.

739
00:55:00,737 --> 00:55:06,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Then in March, the interviews of the three selected firms was carried out.

740
00:55:06,962 --> 00:55:11,766
[SPEAKER_06]: But on May 20th, this council gave up its right

741
00:55:12,919 --> 00:55:20,765
[SPEAKER_06]: of control over the mayor by allowing him to go ahead with a 10 year contract.

742
00:55:21,046 --> 00:55:22,227
[SPEAKER_06]: You all voted for that.

743
00:55:22,527 --> 00:55:23,387
[SPEAKER_06]: I was here for that.

744
00:55:23,948 --> 00:55:25,049
[SPEAKER_06]: I advised against it.

745
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:30,913
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, you're giving up your right to the final contract.

746
00:55:31,634 --> 00:55:36,638
[SPEAKER_06]: So actually this is not solely the mayor's plan.

747
00:55:37,038 --> 00:55:41,482
[SPEAKER_06]: This is also, I hope you all forgive me for saying this,

748
00:55:42,263 --> 00:55:45,204
[SPEAKER_06]: This is also the whole council's plan.

749
00:55:46,405 --> 00:55:50,807
[SPEAKER_06]: The mayor and the council are both responsible for this.

750
00:55:50,907 --> 00:55:52,408
[SPEAKER_06]: The people did not want this.

751
00:55:52,928 --> 00:56:02,352
[SPEAKER_06]: The people wanted, uh, the, uh, uh, they, they wanted, uh, control of the parking, but they did not want to pay for it.

752
00:56:02,612 --> 00:56:04,493
[SPEAKER_06]: The people never wanted a paid plan.

753
00:56:05,732 --> 00:56:14,337
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, normally, the police, if you inquire about this, you'll find out that in the majority of cities throughout the whole nation, the police do all the enforcement.

754
00:56:14,497 --> 00:56:16,519
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't farm it out to another company.

755
00:56:17,539 --> 00:56:29,186
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, on September 10th, when — on May 20th was when the council allowed the mayor to sign a 10-year contract.

756
00:56:30,747 --> 00:56:34,089
[SPEAKER_06]: So — and then on — that was not known to the people.

757
00:56:36,157 --> 00:56:39,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of information, Councilor Marks.

758
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Just if I could, because Dr. Strella brings up a lot of great points.

759
00:56:43,023 --> 00:56:45,365
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would just like to ask the doctor a question.

760
00:56:45,746 --> 00:56:47,908
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that's a proper use of a point of information.

761
00:56:47,928 --> 00:56:51,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Because he's a very astute person and very active with his body, but.

762
00:56:52,131 --> 00:56:52,872
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with that.

763
00:56:53,893 --> 00:56:54,613
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm glad you do.

764
00:56:56,295 --> 00:56:56,795
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm joking.

765
00:56:57,376 --> 00:57:02,580
[SPEAKER_03]: As you know, by state law, the mayor cannot enter into a contract over a term of three years.

766
00:57:02,841 --> 00:57:03,341
[SPEAKER_03]: That's correct.

767
00:57:03,697 --> 00:57:04,498
[SPEAKER_03]: As I understand it.

768
00:57:04,538 --> 00:57:04,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

769
00:57:05,098 --> 00:57:10,883
[SPEAKER_03]: So when the three requests for proposals came back, they were all for a term greater than three years.

770
00:57:12,024 --> 00:57:23,134
[SPEAKER_03]: So what you're saying to me as a member of the council at that point, we turned to the mayor and say, you know what, Mr. Mayor, if you can't negotiate a contract within three years, go back, go back to the drawing table.

771
00:57:23,414 --> 00:57:24,095
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what you're saying.

772
00:57:24,235 --> 00:57:24,655
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

773
00:57:26,016 --> 00:57:26,537
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

774
00:57:26,937 --> 00:57:30,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Knowing that there's a startup cost cause he outsourced everything.

775
00:57:31,130 --> 00:57:34,212
[SPEAKER_03]: And in this case, it was close to a million dollar startup cost.

776
00:57:34,833 --> 00:57:43,899
[SPEAKER_03]: There were no companies, John, that would come into the city, the way the mayor wanted to do it, would come into the city for three years.

777
00:57:44,159 --> 00:57:49,603
[SPEAKER_03]: So under your thought was just to go back to the mayor and say, you know what, we're not moving forward.

778
00:57:49,803 --> 00:57:51,124
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not moving forward with this.

779
00:57:51,884 --> 00:57:58,629
[SPEAKER_03]: My thought was at the time, allow the mayor to negotiate, and then we can have say in what the language will be, John.

780
00:57:59,109 --> 00:57:59,950
[SPEAKER_03]: That was my thought.

781
00:58:00,945 --> 00:58:03,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you may say no, but you don't have that right.

782
00:58:04,547 --> 00:58:06,928
[SPEAKER_06]: You gave him the right to negotiate for 10 years.

783
00:58:07,128 --> 00:58:08,069
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all you get.

784
00:58:08,149 --> 00:58:17,153
[SPEAKER_03]: But as part of that right, as part of that, that, that vote we took, we also put a stipulation that the mayor will bring the proposal back to us for a final vote.

785
00:58:17,474 --> 00:58:22,536
[SPEAKER_03]: That was council appendix resolution and it was voted on unanimously by the council.

786
00:58:22,957 --> 00:58:27,499
[SPEAKER_03]: The fact that the mayor never came back to us to allow us to make changes and to

787
00:58:27,931 --> 00:58:32,552
[SPEAKER_03]: to view the language is not, maybe it's a legal issue.

788
00:58:32,972 --> 00:58:33,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's a legal issue.

789
00:58:34,113 --> 00:58:40,054
[SPEAKER_03]: But that is an amendment that we put on the resolution that allowed him to enter into a multi-year agreement.

790
00:58:40,894 --> 00:58:42,175
[SPEAKER_03]: That is the amendment, John.

791
00:58:42,235 --> 00:58:44,395
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know any way of slicing it up.

792
00:58:44,495 --> 00:58:44,995
[SPEAKER_03]: You're right.

793
00:58:45,075 --> 00:58:46,136
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Councilor Matz.

794
00:58:46,596 --> 00:58:46,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

795
00:58:46,936 --> 00:58:48,436
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a long point if I'm fair.

796
00:58:48,896 --> 00:58:49,817
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a legal issue.

797
00:58:50,497 --> 00:58:52,257
[SPEAKER_06]: And the mayor acted legally.

798
00:58:53,438 --> 00:58:55,038
[SPEAKER_06]: You gave him the right to do that.

799
00:58:55,687 --> 00:58:56,347
[SPEAKER_06]: He accepted it.

800
00:58:56,787 --> 00:59:03,549
[SPEAKER_06]: He took the risk of going ahead with a 10-year contract, not knowing in advance how this council was going to vote.

801
00:59:04,129 --> 00:59:11,210
[SPEAKER_06]: And yet, something like six months later, the council voted to allow the mayor to go to a 10-year contract, which he did.

802
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:16,831
[SPEAKER_06]: That contract is final, and you cannot amend it legally.

803
00:59:17,511 --> 00:59:20,032
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Dr. Stirella.

804
00:59:20,912 --> 00:59:22,613
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Caraviello.

805
00:59:23,273 --> 00:59:24,253
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

806
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:27,140
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to speak first?

807
00:59:28,981 --> 00:59:31,021
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll yield the floor to you.

808
00:59:34,442 --> 00:59:34,822
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

809
00:59:34,862 --> 00:59:36,302
[SPEAKER_23]: This is going to be very brief.

810
00:59:39,363 --> 00:59:47,325
[SPEAKER_23]: Everything that Councilor Mark says, oh, my name is Gwendolyn Blackburn, 233 Arlington Street.

811
00:59:49,566 --> 00:59:55,767
[SPEAKER_23]: Everything that Councilor Mark says, I second because I was on the committee with him, so he knows what

812
00:59:56,295 --> 00:59:57,095
[SPEAKER_23]: all that we did.

813
00:59:57,676 --> 01:00:06,460
[SPEAKER_23]: I do want to tell you, though, that I'm around town a lot, and everybody says, what did the city council do to us?

814
01:00:07,441 --> 01:00:15,705
[SPEAKER_23]: They all believe that the city council is responsible for the kiosk.

815
01:00:16,085 --> 01:00:16,966
[SPEAKER_23]: They do believe it.

816
01:00:17,126 --> 01:00:19,687
[SPEAKER_23]: And I say, city council didn't do it.

817
01:00:19,927 --> 01:00:20,708
[SPEAKER_23]: The mayor did it.

818
01:00:21,388 --> 01:00:24,550
[SPEAKER_23]: So they do believe that all of you

819
01:00:26,344 --> 01:00:28,645
[SPEAKER_23]: You're being held responsible for it.

820
01:00:30,327 --> 01:00:41,275
[SPEAKER_23]: The reason I actually came, because as far as I can tell, we're kind of whistling Dixie here, we're going to lose our businesses in town over these kiosks.

821
01:00:41,943 --> 01:00:53,845
[SPEAKER_23]: And it's really sad that our small businesses cannot afford to stay in business here with people not going into their stores or their shops, whatever it is.

822
01:00:54,625 --> 01:01:03,467
[SPEAKER_23]: But this is something different and probably that other people have already brought it before you or you already know it.

823
01:01:03,847 --> 01:01:07,108
[SPEAKER_23]: But I got an email from a senior citizen

824
01:01:07,888 --> 01:01:15,074
[SPEAKER_23]: who, I'm going to read what she said, and she was in Boston at the theater.

825
01:01:15,814 --> 01:01:18,817
[SPEAKER_23]: Afterward, she came out to Carol's for dinner.

826
01:01:19,577 --> 01:01:24,321
[SPEAKER_23]: It was her first experience with using Medford's pay to park.

827
01:01:25,121 --> 01:01:32,787
[SPEAKER_23]: I parked on Salem Street near the Alamo sandwich shop across the street from Modern Bakery.

828
01:01:33,768 --> 01:01:36,010
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, was I in for a surprise.

829
01:01:36,732 --> 01:01:42,915
[SPEAKER_23]: The street lamps in Medford Square shed very little light.

830
01:01:43,755 --> 01:01:53,320
[SPEAKER_23]: I could not read the directions to see the face of the keyboard on the front of the kiosk.

831
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:55,141
[SPEAKER_23]: It was dark.

832
01:01:55,981 --> 01:01:59,323
[SPEAKER_23]: My friend happened to have a flashlight in her purse.

833
01:02:00,286 --> 01:02:03,889
[SPEAKER_23]: We had to use the flashlight to see the keyboard.

834
01:02:04,870 --> 01:02:11,596
[SPEAKER_23]: As we were walking away from the kiosk, a man was walking up to the one we were leaving.

835
01:02:14,839 --> 01:02:19,003
[SPEAKER_23]: He called us back to ask if he could use the flashlight.

836
01:02:20,083 --> 01:02:24,788
[SPEAKER_23]: Check out the street lights in West Medford Square, she's telling me.

837
01:02:25,829 --> 01:02:26,689
[SPEAKER_23]: In the square,

838
01:02:28,396 --> 01:02:30,098
[SPEAKER_23]: Is the square well lit?

839
01:02:32,201 --> 01:02:36,066
[SPEAKER_23]: I hope it is better than Medford Square.

840
01:02:36,928 --> 01:02:40,192
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't understand why someone did not pick up

841
01:02:41,059 --> 01:02:43,341
[SPEAKER_23]: the poor lighting in Medford Square.

842
01:02:44,321 --> 01:02:47,503
[SPEAKER_23]: And I just wanted to share that because senior citizens can't see it.

843
01:02:48,164 --> 01:02:50,025
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't plan to use the kiosk.

844
01:02:50,385 --> 01:02:57,390
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll probably get tickets or I'll go to Arlington or someplace where they don't have them to do my business, their post office over there.

845
01:02:57,430 --> 01:02:59,732
[SPEAKER_23]: You don't have to use kiosks.

846
01:02:59,752 --> 01:03:01,233
[SPEAKER_23]: You use them in the parking lot.

847
01:03:02,033 --> 01:03:12,558
[SPEAKER_23]: So, I'll go do business where I can, elsewhere, and I hate to do that, but I feel that Medford has really been sold a bill of goods.

848
01:03:13,118 --> 01:03:19,401
[SPEAKER_23]: We're in a situation where we're going to lose some of our small businesses, and it's not going to get better.

849
01:03:19,901 --> 01:03:22,642
[SPEAKER_23]: The mayor is going to do what he has already done.

850
01:03:23,122 --> 01:03:26,866
[SPEAKER_23]: and not pay attention because he doesn't come out to any meetings, so he can't hear you.

851
01:03:27,427 --> 01:03:29,209
[SPEAKER_23]: But I just wanted to share that.

852
01:03:29,389 --> 01:03:33,634
[SPEAKER_23]: I suppose other people have already brought it up about the poor lighting.

853
01:03:35,035 --> 01:03:36,517
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know anything about it.

854
01:03:36,957 --> 01:03:37,838
[SPEAKER_23]: Somebody, you did?

855
01:03:37,858 --> 01:03:39,039
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah.

856
01:03:39,079 --> 01:03:43,865
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn, and Councilor Penta both motion to have all the lighting replaced, if I remember.

857
01:03:44,213 --> 01:03:48,995
[SPEAKER_23]: They put those, I guess, LED or whatever they call them, lights all in the square and you can't see.

858
01:03:50,055 --> 01:03:54,036
[SPEAKER_23]: But I haven't even been by one of those kiosks, so I wouldn't know.

859
01:03:54,616 --> 01:03:54,996
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

860
01:03:55,016 --> 01:03:56,337
[SPEAKER_23]: That's all I wanted to say tonight.

861
01:03:56,697 --> 01:03:57,877
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you very much, Professor.

862
01:03:59,018 --> 01:03:59,858
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Camuso.

863
01:04:02,959 --> 01:04:10,942
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I just, um, I wanted to concur with, I think Dr. Stirella had a fair assessment of the entire process.

864
01:04:11,582 --> 01:04:12,062
[SPEAKER_09]: If for any,

865
01:04:12,758 --> 01:04:22,462
[SPEAKER_09]: At any point during this, if we felt we didn't like what was in that request for proposal, four members of the city council could have voted not to give the mayor the authority.

866
01:04:23,823 --> 01:04:34,087
[SPEAKER_09]: At that point, the process would have stopped, like Councilor Mark said, until he'd come back with something that was palatable that would then give him the authority to go out for the 10 years.

867
01:04:35,388 --> 01:04:35,608
[SPEAKER_09]: So.

868
01:04:36,328 --> 01:04:36,708
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

869
01:04:37,209 --> 01:04:39,770
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Caraviello, point of information, Councilor Panto.

870
01:04:41,726 --> 01:04:51,332
[SPEAKER_11]: What Councilor Camuso is saying is only 50% true because the RFP that went out also included the RFP on questions that came back from the three vendors.

871
01:04:51,472 --> 01:04:55,714
[SPEAKER_11]: We as a council had no way of knowing what those questions and how they were going to be answered.

872
01:04:55,754 --> 01:05:04,399
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight rightfully brought up the fact of the private vendor making the signs when that's a contract issue here with people who work for the city.

873
01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:10,243
[SPEAKER_11]: But the dual part of the story is that we asked for the city to make its presentation

874
01:05:10,687 --> 01:05:15,869
[SPEAKER_11]: if the city, in fact, was going to be the person that was going to put the kiosk or whatever it might be.

875
01:05:16,430 --> 01:05:19,831
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's the reason why this Medford City Council voted seven to nothing.

876
01:05:20,091 --> 01:05:25,014
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm quite sure the clerk in his minutes that took place in the executive session will attest to that.

877
01:05:26,254 --> 01:05:27,295
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Caraviello?

878
01:05:28,916 --> 01:05:29,936
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Councilor Camuso.

879
01:05:30,136 --> 01:05:30,476
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

880
01:05:30,496 --> 01:05:30,957
[SPEAKER_09]: My apologies.

881
01:05:31,417 --> 01:05:35,319
[SPEAKER_09]: And as I was stating, and Councilor Marks was 100% correct, this whole

882
01:05:39,897 --> 01:05:46,099
[SPEAKER_09]: All the internal language of the final document was the mayor and the mayor only.

883
01:05:46,259 --> 01:05:48,540
[SPEAKER_09]: We had several recommendations getting us up to that point.

884
01:05:48,580 --> 01:05:50,981
[SPEAKER_09]: I, for one, wanted regular meters.

885
01:05:51,041 --> 01:05:52,382
[SPEAKER_09]: You put a quarter in and that was it.

886
01:05:52,522 --> 01:05:56,763
[SPEAKER_09]: This council supported that unanimously way back when at one of the early on meetings.

887
01:05:57,564 --> 01:06:00,565
[SPEAKER_09]: So Councilor Marks is correct when he says that.

888
01:06:00,985 --> 01:06:05,967
[SPEAKER_09]: But my point is, I just want everyone to know that, and I'm trying to say this the right way so that Councilor Marks

889
01:06:06,584 --> 01:06:07,605
[SPEAKER_09]: because I understand what you're saying.

890
01:06:07,625 --> 01:06:08,685
[SPEAKER_09]: People are getting confused.

891
01:06:08,985 --> 01:06:11,107
[SPEAKER_09]: And as the young lady from West Medford stated, Ms.

892
01:06:11,147 --> 01:06:15,970
[SPEAKER_09]: Blackburn, I don't know if she left, but as she stated, everyone is saying it's the Medford City Council.

893
01:06:16,410 --> 01:06:29,978
[SPEAKER_09]: And then when certain members of the council are just trying to throw this off on other people and this and that, all the votes that were taken by this council, all the votes that were actually taken by the call of the yeas and nays regarding parking has been unanimous.

894
01:06:30,859 --> 01:06:33,781
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, once the final,

895
01:06:37,229 --> 01:06:38,851
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of information, Councilor Penta.

896
01:06:38,991 --> 01:06:43,695
[SPEAKER_11]: Those votes that were taken were for traffic enforcement, not revenue enhancement.

897
01:06:44,056 --> 01:06:45,117
[SPEAKER_11]: Read all the resolutions.

898
01:06:45,537 --> 01:06:49,040
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I said, Mr. President, Councilor Penta can say whatever he wants.

899
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:49,881
[SPEAKER_09]: He can backpedal.

900
01:06:50,402 --> 01:06:57,669
[SPEAKER_09]: But the bottom line is, we saw the request for proposal early in 2014, as Dr. Stirella stated.

901
01:06:58,289 --> 01:07:01,492
[SPEAKER_09]: We gave the mayor the authority, knowing what was in that written proposal.

902
01:07:02,385 --> 01:07:10,103
[SPEAKER_09]: So you know what, if we feel like maybe we made a mistake doing it, then let's say that we made a mistake and it's something different than we thought.

903
01:07:10,678 --> 01:07:21,782
[SPEAKER_09]: But to throw the red herring out that three members of this council, or four members, or five members, or six members of this council voted one way and other members didn't, it was unanimous, all the votes.

904
01:07:21,822 --> 01:07:26,323
[SPEAKER_09]: And the city clerk's gonna give it to us next week because I asked for that in the form of a resolution.

905
01:07:26,744 --> 01:07:36,327
[SPEAKER_09]: So once it's apples to apples, I may take out a full page ad in the Medford transcript so that the people can see that Councilor Penta is not being forthcoming and truthful 100% on this.

906
01:07:38,340 --> 01:07:39,821
[SPEAKER_11]: point of personal privilege.

907
01:07:39,861 --> 01:07:42,042
[SPEAKER_11]: Since you mentioned my name, let's get it straight.

908
01:07:42,062 --> 01:07:43,363
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think the clerk has got to go down.

909
01:07:43,603 --> 01:07:45,944
[SPEAKER_11]: You've already identified the fact that an RFP went out.

910
01:07:45,984 --> 01:07:47,185
[SPEAKER_11]: We have no argument with that.

911
01:07:47,405 --> 01:07:52,267
[SPEAKER_11]: You also identified the fact that the mayor asked to go forward with one of the three vendors.

912
01:07:52,468 --> 01:07:53,948
[SPEAKER_11]: So those are your two votes right there.

913
01:07:54,108 --> 01:07:56,530
[SPEAKER_11]: Those are the only two votes that this council took on that.

914
01:07:56,710 --> 01:08:08,136
[SPEAKER_11]: But the amendment, the amendment to the vote to go forward was predicated on bringing in A, the city's cost of what it would be, and B, a finalization before the council, before a contract was signed.

915
01:08:08,236 --> 01:08:08,776
[SPEAKER_09]: And was there?

916
01:08:09,116 --> 01:08:09,857
[SPEAKER_11]: Listen, you don't have to.

917
01:08:10,117 --> 01:08:10,717
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President.

918
01:08:10,757 --> 01:08:12,898
[SPEAKER_11]: All you have to do is watch the tape, ladies and gentlemen.

919
01:08:12,958 --> 01:08:14,019
[SPEAKER_11]: It's as clear as the bell.

920
01:08:14,179 --> 01:08:15,440
[SPEAKER_09]: He can say it any way he wants.

921
01:08:18,101 --> 01:08:27,786
[SPEAKER_09]: And as I stated, Mr. President, when the councillor wants to do coffee talk banter and blame certain members of this council, the vote.

922
01:08:27,826 --> 01:08:31,208
[SPEAKER_09]: You're running around the town telling.

923
01:08:31,228 --> 01:08:34,650
[SPEAKER_18]: Point of clarification, Councilor Longo-Curran.

924
01:08:35,732 --> 01:08:37,292
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like we're being repetitive.

925
01:08:37,553 --> 01:08:39,353
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm objecting to this conversation.

926
01:08:39,713 --> 01:08:42,954
[SPEAKER_04]: If we could try to answer some questions, solve some problems.

927
01:08:43,394 --> 01:08:44,275
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, councillor.

928
01:08:45,015 --> 01:08:45,395
[SPEAKER_09]: So moved.

929
01:08:45,415 --> 01:08:46,175
[SPEAKER_09]: Let the people speak.

930
01:08:46,255 --> 01:08:46,995
[SPEAKER_09]: If I could just finish.

931
01:08:47,035 --> 01:08:47,655
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to wrap up.

932
01:08:47,856 --> 01:08:50,136
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Camuso is going to wrap up.

933
01:08:50,196 --> 01:08:51,437
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to wrap it up.

934
01:08:51,777 --> 01:09:02,320
[SPEAKER_09]: But when I have people that are telling me, when Councilor Caraviello is having people tell him directly, four or five people, and other councillors are hearing the same stuff,

935
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:07,383
[SPEAKER_09]: All these different groups are not making it up that this is what's being said out there.

936
01:09:07,683 --> 01:09:08,704
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just want the truth.

937
01:09:09,024 --> 01:09:10,585
[SPEAKER_09]: The truth will set everybody free.

938
01:09:11,186 --> 01:09:12,267
[SPEAKER_09]: The truth will set us free.

939
01:09:12,607 --> 01:09:22,434
[SPEAKER_09]: So the clerk next week will come back with the documents, and then we'll see in the local newspaper, come election time, if Councilor Penta's words come back to bite him.

940
01:09:22,714 --> 01:09:24,015
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Councilor Camuso.

941
01:09:24,856 --> 01:09:26,277
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Caraviello.

942
01:09:27,099 --> 01:09:28,819
[SPEAKER_11]: Just mention my name again.

943
01:09:28,899 --> 01:09:32,640
[SPEAKER_11]: If he has a vendetta, if he has a vendetta out for me, why don't you just tell the public that, okay?

944
01:09:32,860 --> 01:09:36,041
[SPEAKER_11]: You're a lame duck councillor, so your words, you can say anything you want about me.

945
01:09:36,201 --> 01:09:37,762
[SPEAKER_11]: It means absolutely nothing, okay?

946
01:09:39,442 --> 01:09:41,683
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you can do it all you want in election time, okay?

947
01:09:41,883 --> 01:09:44,143
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'll do all I want during this period.

948
01:09:44,443 --> 01:09:47,304
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know what I'm saying because this does not lie.

949
01:09:47,824 --> 01:09:50,485
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you watch a councillor, that doesn't lie.

950
01:09:50,505 --> 01:09:51,325
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

951
01:09:52,385 --> 01:09:53,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Caraviello has the floor.

952
01:09:54,306 --> 01:09:55,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

953
01:09:58,071 --> 01:10:00,593
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Dr. Stroll made a good point here.

954
01:10:01,033 --> 01:10:05,097
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the blame pie is pretty big here, and we all need to take a piece of it.

955
01:10:07,118 --> 01:10:14,504
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if you ask any member of this group here, do we support this plan in the form that it is, I'd be shocked if anyone said yes.

956
01:10:15,585 --> 01:10:18,047
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why Councilor Penta needs another vote tonight.

957
01:10:18,067 --> 01:10:21,550
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're all in agreement that we're not happy with this plan that we have.

958
01:10:22,491 --> 01:10:24,412
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's been worked on.

959
01:10:24,813 --> 01:10:26,114
[SPEAKER_02]: It's changing and changing and changing.

960
01:10:27,685 --> 01:10:31,148
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't mention my name.

961
01:10:32,089 --> 01:10:32,770
[SPEAKER_11]: You certainly did.

962
01:10:32,790 --> 01:10:33,811
[SPEAKER_11]: You just said Councilor Pantus.

963
01:10:34,091 --> 01:10:36,273
[SPEAKER_11]: I said Councilor Pantus.

964
01:10:36,373 --> 01:10:37,314
[SPEAKER_11]: It's my resolution.

965
01:10:38,075 --> 01:10:42,039
[SPEAKER_11]: So could you tell him to please be quiet and let somebody speak?

966
01:10:43,633 --> 01:10:45,274
[SPEAKER_11]: Rick, not for anything.

967
01:10:45,334 --> 01:10:50,275
[SPEAKER_11]: If everybody was so opposed to it, then according to Councilor Camuso, we should have never ever voted for it.

968
01:10:50,916 --> 01:10:52,756
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you can't have it both ways.

969
01:10:52,776 --> 01:10:58,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Penta, if you just hear what I said, I said we all need to take a piece of this blame pie.

970
01:10:58,858 --> 01:10:59,078
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

971
01:10:59,438 --> 01:11:01,639
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we did vote to accept this.

972
01:11:01,999 --> 01:11:02,459
[SPEAKER_11]: No, we didn't.

973
01:11:02,479 --> 01:11:02,780
[SPEAKER_02]: We did.

974
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:03,940
[SPEAKER_02]: You maybe did, I didn't.

975
01:11:03,980 --> 01:11:04,260
[SPEAKER_02]: We did.

976
01:11:04,580 --> 01:11:07,021
[SPEAKER_02]: We may have gotten duped in what we thought we were going to get.

977
01:11:08,312 --> 01:11:11,755
[SPEAKER_11]: We kind of get duped into something that never came to for a final vote.

978
01:11:11,795 --> 01:11:12,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me that.

979
01:11:12,536 --> 01:11:13,057
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with you 100%.

980
01:11:13,958 --> 01:11:18,322
[SPEAKER_02]: We thought the plan was going to come back to us, so we would know further.

981
01:11:18,362 --> 01:11:19,283
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't get that.

982
01:11:19,643 --> 01:11:23,067
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's the answer right there.

983
01:11:23,127 --> 01:11:25,729
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's no one around this room that's going to disagree with anything you say there.

984
01:11:26,830 --> 01:11:27,090
[SPEAKER_02]: OK?

985
01:11:27,311 --> 01:11:31,255
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, that's the truth of the matter.

986
01:11:34,064 --> 01:11:36,005
[SPEAKER_02]: My friend can believe whatever he wants.

987
01:11:36,065 --> 01:11:38,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you still going or?

988
01:11:38,307 --> 01:11:39,447
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still going.

989
01:11:39,467 --> 01:11:50,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I would doubt that the mayor was going to say, let's just pull the plan and throw it away and write a check for a million dollars to the parking company.

990
01:11:51,414 --> 01:11:53,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's not happening.

991
01:11:54,256 --> 01:11:58,198
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, another vote tonight on this.

992
01:11:58,259 --> 01:12:00,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I respect where you're coming from, Councilor Pandella.

993
01:12:01,660 --> 01:12:04,281
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no one around this rail that's happy with this parking plan.

994
01:12:05,181 --> 01:12:09,443
[SPEAKER_02]: And if there is a person here, then I'm shocked about it.

995
01:12:10,403 --> 01:12:10,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay?

996
01:12:10,863 --> 01:12:16,645
[SPEAKER_02]: So another vote of disapproval, I don't think it's necessary, Councilor Penta.

997
01:12:17,406 --> 01:12:19,006
[SPEAKER_02]: It is my opinion.

998
01:12:19,066 --> 01:12:21,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I think it's a redundant vote to do.

999
01:12:21,967 --> 01:12:23,328
[SPEAKER_02]: And one last thing.

1000
01:12:26,509 --> 01:12:30,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Certain media groups have challenged my ability to vote.

1001
01:12:31,415 --> 01:12:33,978
[SPEAKER_02]: for this issue because I'm a member of the Chamber of Commerce.

1002
01:12:35,439 --> 01:12:43,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Today, I sought an opinion to the State Ethics Committee, whether I am allowed to, because I am a board director.

1003
01:12:44,726 --> 01:12:48,189
[SPEAKER_02]: State Ethics Committee has no problem with me voting on this here.

1004
01:12:50,531 --> 01:12:57,797
[SPEAKER_02]: They asked that I do not sign anything as far as the chamber, but anything with this product or any other issue that the chamber has,

1005
01:12:59,383 --> 01:13:01,684
[SPEAKER_02]: they have no problem with me voting on it.

1006
01:13:01,704 --> 01:13:07,026
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just wanted to make that clear because there's been a certain media group out there saying that I'm in conflict of interest.

1007
01:13:07,366 --> 01:13:07,967
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is.

1008
01:13:09,107 --> 01:13:10,388
[SPEAKER_11]: Question.

1009
01:13:11,648 --> 01:13:13,549
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Carafiello has the floor.

1010
01:13:13,569 --> 01:13:14,389
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I'm sorry.

1011
01:13:14,409 --> 01:13:20,232
[SPEAKER_11]: Then the question is this, as a member of the chamber, did you vote for this or not when the board of directors voted, yes or no?

1012
01:13:21,372 --> 01:13:22,593
[SPEAKER_02]: I supported a parking plan.

1013
01:13:22,653 --> 01:13:26,114
[SPEAKER_02]: You supported the plan that was presented.

1014
01:13:26,314 --> 01:13:27,495
[SPEAKER_02]: I supported the same plan that

1015
01:13:28,008 --> 01:13:29,928
[SPEAKER_04]: to allow them to negotiate.

1016
01:13:30,869 --> 01:13:32,189
[SPEAKER_02]: We supported a parking plan.

1017
01:13:32,829 --> 01:13:35,029
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't have an actual plan in front of us.

1018
01:13:35,049 --> 01:13:37,050
[SPEAKER_02]: All we did was support parking.

1019
01:13:39,010 --> 01:13:42,310
[SPEAKER_02]: A parking plan, okay?

1020
01:13:42,350 --> 01:13:44,691
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we supported.

1021
01:13:46,011 --> 01:13:51,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I'll take my share of the pie on this, and I think everyone else around this room needs to take their share of the pie.

1022
01:13:51,772 --> 01:13:56,773
[SPEAKER_02]: We got duped into a plan we didn't like, and I know there's not one person around this room that's happy with this plan.

1023
01:13:58,179 --> 01:14:05,863
[SPEAKER_02]: So, again, I understand where you want to go with this, but I think we're all pretty unanimous on how we feel about this.

1024
01:14:07,704 --> 01:14:11,606
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much, Councilor Caraviello, for that presentation.

1025
01:14:11,646 --> 01:14:12,687
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Langley-Kern?

1026
01:14:13,187 --> 01:14:13,608
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll yield.

1027
01:14:13,708 --> 01:14:15,689
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like people to stand.

1028
01:14:16,449 --> 01:14:17,330
[SPEAKER_18]: OK.

1029
01:14:18,990 --> 01:14:23,193
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor, Mr. Citizen, please state your name and address for the record.

1030
01:14:23,433 --> 01:14:24,754
[SPEAKER_10]: My name is Nick Tomazook.

1031
01:14:24,954 --> 01:14:26,515
[SPEAKER_10]: I live at 29 Garfield Ave.

1032
01:14:27,778 --> 01:14:31,221
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if you guys ever heard the expression, a happy worker's a dangerous worker.

1033
01:14:32,542 --> 01:14:34,083
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys are fighting amongst each other.

1034
01:14:34,103 --> 01:14:35,905
[SPEAKER_10]: You should be fighting the guy across the hall.

1035
01:14:38,226 --> 01:14:40,248
[SPEAKER_10]: Together, not separate.

1036
01:14:41,569 --> 01:14:45,773
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever happened in the past, you should just sweep it under the carpet, forget it, and start new.

1037
01:14:46,773 --> 01:14:48,475
[SPEAKER_10]: But you guys got to get together to fight that guy.

1038
01:14:50,734 --> 01:14:57,075
[SPEAKER_10]: And to alleviate the problem with the kiosks, I hear a lot of senior citizens asking me questions.

1039
01:14:57,175 --> 01:14:58,936
[SPEAKER_10]: And I said, well, how the hell can I answer them?

1040
01:14:59,916 --> 01:15:08,558
[SPEAKER_10]: I said, there's been such a lack of information and misinformation about these kiosks, the Times, and the East, and everything else.

1041
01:15:09,978 --> 01:15:16,720
[SPEAKER_10]: What they should do is just program those kiosks when they're not enforceable to have it on the screen.

1042
01:15:19,713 --> 01:15:28,430
[SPEAKER_10]: Parking does not, it's not in effect, or the kiosk is not, the parking enforcement is not enforced at this time.

1043
01:15:29,182 --> 01:15:32,524
[SPEAKER_10]: after 7 o'clock, because you're confusing a lot of those senior citizens out there.

1044
01:15:32,544 --> 01:15:37,186
[SPEAKER_17]: They're feeding a stupid thing after 7 o'clock on Sunday.

1045
01:15:37,526 --> 01:15:41,067
[SPEAKER_02]: I brought this with the gentleman that there's no hours of operation on those kiosks.

1046
01:15:41,087 --> 01:15:45,829
[SPEAKER_02]: So people don't know when they're in effect and not in effect, and he says that he can put them on there.

1047
01:15:46,070 --> 01:15:51,532
[SPEAKER_02]: They put it right into the program, just like that whole thing, just put it right on.

1048
01:15:51,812 --> 01:15:53,713
[SPEAKER_02]: So people don't have to walk up to it.

1049
01:15:53,993 --> 01:15:55,394
[SPEAKER_02]: They can see on the side of the kiosk

1050
01:15:56,456 --> 01:15:58,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Hours of operation, days of operation.

1051
01:15:58,877 --> 01:15:59,957
[SPEAKER_02]: And I asked the gentleman.

1052
01:16:00,017 --> 01:16:01,097
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you the whole story.

1053
01:16:01,157 --> 01:16:01,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not feed it.

1054
01:16:02,338 --> 01:16:02,518
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1055
01:16:02,598 --> 01:16:08,359
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a, at least if it's on the side of the machine and large lettering, you'll know rather than having to walk up and push a button.

1056
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:13,881
[SPEAKER_02]: The gentleman from the parking company said that's something they can do is to put it on both sides.

1057
01:16:14,221 --> 01:16:17,442
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you pull up and it's on reflective, even if it's dark, at least it'll show up.

1058
01:16:17,762 --> 01:16:17,942
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

1059
01:16:18,182 --> 01:16:21,483
[SPEAKER_10]: And another point is somebody brought up the lighting in the square.

1060
01:16:22,884 --> 01:16:24,204
[SPEAKER_10]: I brought that up last year.

1061
01:16:25,585 --> 01:16:29,186
[SPEAKER_10]: I said, clean those lenses and put high-intensity bulbs in there.

1062
01:16:29,226 --> 01:16:31,147
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't have to change the light post or anything.

1063
01:16:31,187 --> 01:16:40,229
[SPEAKER_10]: Just put a transformer in there to take care of the high-intensity lights, and you'll have that square lit up like Fenway Park.

1064
01:16:41,629 --> 01:16:46,471
[SPEAKER_10]: Instead of spending a whole bunch of money, you change the head of it.

1065
01:16:47,411 --> 01:16:48,931
[SPEAKER_10]: The power's already there and everything.

1066
01:16:52,092 --> 01:16:53,053
[SPEAKER_16]: Point of information, Councilor.

1067
01:16:53,073 --> 01:16:54,253
[SPEAKER_02]: This morning, I was in Denham Center.

1068
01:16:55,248 --> 01:17:00,173
[SPEAKER_02]: And all their lights have the light shift, the nice bright white lights that you're talking about, whole square was all lit up.

1069
01:17:00,353 --> 01:17:02,255
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have the yellow or the orange light.

1070
01:17:03,256 --> 01:17:03,476
[SPEAKER_02]: 100% right.

1071
01:17:03,496 --> 01:17:05,879
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't know what the cost of changing those lenses.

1072
01:17:06,039 --> 01:17:10,123
[SPEAKER_10]: The lenses were all changed this year.

1073
01:17:10,864 --> 01:17:14,007
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm not mistaken, I think the lenses were all changed this year.

1074
01:17:14,448 --> 01:17:16,750
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, but they're orange lights and they just don't throw.

1075
01:17:17,746 --> 01:17:22,568
[SPEAKER_10]: I was at another town today, bright white lights, they look fabulous.

1076
01:17:23,649 --> 01:17:27,950
[SPEAKER_10]: But we have to do something about those kiosks because people are feeding those things when they don't need to.

1077
01:17:29,691 --> 01:17:30,591
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're making more money.

1078
01:17:30,931 --> 01:17:31,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of clarification on that.

1079
01:17:31,992 --> 01:17:34,053
[SPEAKER_10]: Point of clarification, Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

1080
01:17:34,153 --> 01:17:43,116
[SPEAKER_04]: From the representative from Republic, are people able to feed the meter or will the machine reject any payment after 7 p.m.

1081
01:17:43,176 --> 01:17:43,736
[SPEAKER_04]: or before 7 a.m.?

1082
01:17:43,816 --> 01:17:44,477
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't reject.

1083
01:17:46,323 --> 01:17:48,344
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, then it should be rejected.

1084
01:17:48,384 --> 01:17:48,824
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

1085
01:17:48,844 --> 01:17:57,008
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why I said, put something on the screen or something that, you know, hours of operation or whatnot, and it shouldn't accept money after seven o'clock.

1086
01:17:57,108 --> 01:17:57,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1087
01:17:57,288 --> 01:17:58,608
[SPEAKER_04]: It shouldn't accept money.

1088
01:17:59,009 --> 01:18:00,569
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.

1089
01:18:00,589 --> 01:18:08,893
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's people are afraid of getting people off because for the lousy dollar that you put in there, they're going to give you a 15 or $20 ticket.

1090
01:18:08,913 --> 01:18:08,893
25.

1091
01:18:09,954 --> 01:18:11,194
[SPEAKER_10]: So we've got to help them out guys.

1092
01:18:12,215 --> 01:18:13,055
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I said before,

1093
01:18:13,643 --> 01:18:19,148
[SPEAKER_10]: The only, you are really beating a dead horse because you already signed that contract and we're stuck with it for 10 years.

1094
01:18:19,168 --> 01:18:21,850
[SPEAKER_10]: The only thing is, is you guys can make it easier.

1095
01:18:23,091 --> 01:18:23,432
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1096
01:18:23,972 --> 01:18:25,553
[SPEAKER_10]: Take the weight off the people's shoulders.

1097
01:18:27,435 --> 01:18:33,180
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't know if you remember the, uh, sober paved road to the carriage house, sir.

1098
01:18:33,781 --> 01:18:34,361
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, sir.

1099
01:18:35,722 --> 01:18:37,764
[SPEAKER_18]: Council longer current has the floor next.

1100
01:18:37,924 --> 01:18:38,985
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1101
01:18:39,005 --> 01:18:40,667
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to, I want to get to your question.

1102
01:18:40,687 --> 01:18:41,087
[SPEAKER_11]: You just said,

1103
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:42,941
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you want a point of information?

1104
01:18:42,961 --> 01:18:43,641
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of information?

1105
01:18:43,681 --> 01:18:44,382
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, point of information.

1106
01:18:44,622 --> 01:18:46,262
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of information, Councilor Penta.

1107
01:18:46,343 --> 01:18:47,723
[SPEAKER_11]: There are two opt-out positions in this.

1108
01:18:47,943 --> 01:18:54,167
[SPEAKER_11]: After 90 days, if this is not working out for either party, there's opt-out provisions, and there's an opt-out provision at the end of the first year.

1109
01:18:54,787 --> 01:18:57,348
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just thought I'd let you know we don't have to live with this for 10 years.

1110
01:18:57,628 --> 01:18:57,908
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.

1111
01:18:57,988 --> 01:19:08,474
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm quite sure there's going to be a whole host of legal questions that are going to arise that maybe Republicans are not going to want to entertain, because maybe they're just going to say this isn't worth it.

1112
01:19:09,185 --> 01:19:11,405
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, everybody's thinking that they're yearning for 10 years.

1113
01:19:11,666 --> 01:19:12,286
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the thing.

1114
01:19:13,086 --> 01:19:14,646
[SPEAKER_10]: Because there was no information on it.

1115
01:19:16,147 --> 01:19:18,647
[SPEAKER_10]: I still haven't got any information about it at all.

1116
01:19:21,008 --> 01:19:22,288
[SPEAKER_10]: I just don't come to the square anymore.

1117
01:19:24,868 --> 01:19:25,128
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

1118
01:19:25,168 --> 01:19:25,809
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you very much.

1119
01:19:26,169 --> 01:19:27,209
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1120
01:19:27,909 --> 01:19:29,950
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Lungo, Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

1121
01:19:30,010 --> 01:19:31,870
[SPEAKER_04]: A few questions, I guess, for our public then.

1122
01:19:34,771 --> 01:19:36,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a way to shut the meters off?

1123
01:19:37,204 --> 01:19:38,124
[SPEAKER_04]: at 7 p.m.

1124
01:19:38,165 --> 01:19:40,005
[SPEAKER_04]: and not turn them back on until 7 a.m.?

1125
01:19:49,270 --> 01:19:52,031
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't believe so, but I will confirm for sure.

1126
01:19:52,071 --> 01:19:57,234
[SPEAKER_13]: I know we have a program so that you can't buy more time than the meter or the time, the posted time allows.

1127
01:19:58,545 --> 01:20:03,788
[SPEAKER_13]: I do know that the signage that's posted for the meters does give the times from 7 a.m.

1128
01:20:03,808 --> 01:20:05,609
[SPEAKER_13]: to 7 p.m., and that is reflective.

1129
01:20:05,889 --> 01:20:07,750
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to add some more signage to the side.

1130
01:20:08,331 --> 01:20:13,333
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll confirm and report back if they can physically program shut off at a specific time.

1131
01:20:13,813 --> 01:20:20,197
[SPEAKER_04]: If we could have that question answered through the chair, if Republic can shut off the machines from 7 p.m.

1132
01:20:20,557 --> 01:20:22,698
[SPEAKER_18]: Point of information, Councilor Caraviello.

1133
01:20:22,718 --> 01:20:27,761
[SPEAKER_02]: In some of them, their meters shut off, they will not accept money

1134
01:20:28,392 --> 01:20:31,933
[SPEAKER_02]: after the, whatever particular hour they, they are.

1135
01:20:31,953 --> 01:20:38,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I've been there and I've tried to put money in and I didn't realize that the hour and it would not accept it after eight o'clock or whatever time they had.

1136
01:20:39,655 --> 01:20:44,437
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I just don't, I don't want to answer definitely yes without being sure.

1137
01:20:44,557 --> 01:20:49,458
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know it is, you know, other kiosks do stop with it.

1138
01:20:49,478 --> 01:20:54,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it will not take any money after, after the hour or whatever hour is up.

1139
01:20:55,107 --> 01:20:55,267
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

1140
01:20:55,347 --> 01:20:58,950
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I know these kiosks are in similar cities and they don't shut off.

1141
01:20:59,010 --> 01:21:00,611
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just, I'm not a hundred percent sure.

1142
01:21:00,691 --> 01:21:03,052
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm sure the capability exists to do that.

1143
01:21:03,072 --> 01:21:03,152
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

1144
01:21:03,253 --> 01:21:05,314
[SPEAKER_13]: We can figure it out.

1145
01:21:05,334 --> 01:21:17,722
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, um, I, a few issues were brought to my attention today through a phone call and I guess it relates to the entire program, but you know, there's certain spots where there's no signage, there's certain spots where there's no kiosks.

1146
01:21:17,922 --> 01:21:24,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there an internal audit being done of where we need more signage, where we need more kiosks?

1147
01:21:24,891 --> 01:21:31,612
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, like I stated earlier, we were put on hold putting any signage out because of a DPW issue and whether we could do it.

1148
01:21:32,492 --> 01:21:37,793
[SPEAKER_13]: I finally got clarification literally this morning that we could do it, and we're now going to go back and do it.

1149
01:21:37,853 --> 01:21:43,174
[SPEAKER_13]: The DPW said that they don't have the capacity to do it right now.

1150
01:21:43,614 --> 01:21:47,235
[SPEAKER_13]: We'd get it done quicker than they would, and as long as we do it between the hours of 7 a.m.

1151
01:21:47,275 --> 01:21:52,636
[SPEAKER_13]: and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, and we're not taking away from overtime opportunities that the union

1152
01:21:53,720 --> 01:21:54,581
[SPEAKER_13]: was on board with that.

1153
01:21:55,141 --> 01:21:59,544
[SPEAKER_13]: So I do have a list of about 62 signs that have to go up.

1154
01:22:00,524 --> 01:22:09,530
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it's like, there's no kiosk in front of, from what I understand, in front of Citizens Bank, there's four spots, there's no kiosk, so do people have to pay or do they not have to pay?

1155
01:22:09,550 --> 01:22:10,691
[SPEAKER_13]: In Medford Square?

1156
01:22:10,851 --> 01:22:17,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Medford Square, in front of Citizens Bank, there's that inlet, four spots, there's no kiosk.

1157
01:22:18,796 --> 01:22:19,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Do they have to go into the

1158
01:22:20,126 --> 01:22:23,067
[SPEAKER_04]: the other side of the parking lot, or do they have to cross the street?

1159
01:22:23,487 --> 01:22:28,448
[SPEAKER_13]: If I'm correct, the first couple are signed as 30-minute pay meter.

1160
01:22:28,788 --> 01:22:30,728
[SPEAKER_13]: You'd have to pay the kiosk that is in close proximity.

1161
01:22:30,748 --> 01:22:32,889
[SPEAKER_13]: The rest are just limited time enforcement.

1162
01:22:32,909 --> 01:22:34,989
[SPEAKER_13]: They don't say pay meter, so you wouldn't actually have to pay a meter.

1163
01:22:38,050 --> 01:22:41,231
[SPEAKER_13]: If the signs say pay meter, then you pay the meter for that spot.

1164
01:22:41,271 --> 01:22:44,011
[SPEAKER_13]: If they don't say pay meter, then you don't pay the meter.

1165
01:22:44,312 --> 01:22:45,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I was in the parking lot.

1166
01:22:47,710 --> 01:22:50,132
[SPEAKER_04]: behind CVS right near Citizens Bank.

1167
01:22:50,813 --> 01:22:53,855
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, signage was inadequate, I think.

1168
01:22:53,915 --> 01:22:54,295
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my opinion.

1169
01:22:54,315 --> 01:22:54,536
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.

1170
01:22:54,556 --> 01:22:57,018
[SPEAKER_13]: And like I said, we got told to stop doing the signage.

1171
01:22:57,078 --> 01:23:02,782
[SPEAKER_13]: So I couldn't do anything about it until I was told literally this morning at quarter of 8 that I could go and do it.

1172
01:23:02,802 --> 01:23:04,684
[SPEAKER_13]: And when will the new signs go out?

1173
01:23:04,764 --> 01:23:07,486
[SPEAKER_13]: We're getting back on the horse starting tomorrow to get the signs out there.

1174
01:23:12,070 --> 01:23:13,471
[SPEAKER_04]: I also have questions with the public.

1175
01:23:13,831 --> 01:23:15,173
[SPEAKER_04]: With regards to the resolution, I

1176
01:23:16,573 --> 01:23:19,515
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with Councilor Caraviello in a way.

1177
01:23:20,095 --> 01:23:38,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Voting for or against it, I agree that every single councilor has issues and could almost arguably be against the project for certain reasons, but I think things need to be seriously tweaked and concerns need to be hashed out and changes need to be made.

1178
01:23:38,768 --> 01:23:46,213
[SPEAKER_04]: I think what we set out to do a year and a half ago when we kept pushing for parking enforcement, it was to get our

1179
01:23:46,725 --> 01:23:51,106
[SPEAKER_04]: police department to initiate more parking enforcement for more turnover.

1180
01:23:51,507 --> 01:23:55,488
[SPEAKER_04]: What it turned into is what, you know, obviously what the mayor wanted, the kiosks.

1181
01:23:55,528 --> 01:24:01,790
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember Councilor Mucks specifically, even I think Councilor Camuso mentioned too, why not meters?

1182
01:24:01,830 --> 01:24:03,391
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we tried to ask questions.

1183
01:24:03,691 --> 01:24:05,691
[SPEAKER_04]: They just really fell on deaf ears.

1184
01:24:06,332 --> 01:24:09,453
[SPEAKER_04]: But we need to offer some sort of free parking.

1185
01:24:09,493 --> 01:24:15,935
[SPEAKER_04]: And if, you know, we need to give the mayor however long it is appropriate, whether that's weeks or months,

1186
01:24:16,598 --> 01:24:17,799
[SPEAKER_04]: to make the changes.

1187
01:24:17,819 --> 01:24:21,243
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to give some relief to the businesses.

1188
01:24:21,283 --> 01:24:27,309
[SPEAKER_04]: We need 15, 30, maybe even an hour worth of free parking, or we need to lower the rate.

1189
01:24:28,189 --> 01:24:39,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Different things need to be thrown around, and the mayor needs to listen loud and clear, realize what's happening in West Medford Square, realize the issues that are in every, I'm sure there's issues in every district.

1190
01:24:41,781 --> 01:24:42,902
[SPEAKER_04]: in every one of our squares.

1191
01:24:42,942 --> 01:24:48,385
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know some things are being hashed out, some concerns are being taken under advisement and really being worked on.

1192
01:24:48,785 --> 01:24:52,508
[SPEAKER_04]: You know the chief's been active, Republic has been working with the chief.

1193
01:24:52,688 --> 01:25:01,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Changes are being made, but a big change that needs to be made, and like I said at the Committee of the Whole meeting, is some sort of free parking.

1194
01:25:01,453 --> 01:25:09,238
[SPEAKER_04]: And if the city has to take the hit on the amount of income that we were supposed to bring in, then I think every councilor behind this rail would vote

1195
01:25:09,717 --> 01:25:13,940
[SPEAKER_04]: for the city to reduce that amount of income that we're supposed to generate.

1196
01:25:14,621 --> 01:25:25,910
[SPEAKER_04]: This wasn't to, I as one councilor did not necessarily want to make money on the backs of the consumer and the businesses.

1197
01:25:26,650 --> 01:25:35,257
[SPEAKER_04]: The city needs to make some serious changes so that we can see our businesses survive rather than what's going on right now.

1198
01:25:41,607 --> 01:25:41,947
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1199
01:25:43,168 --> 01:25:44,069
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you to the chief.

1200
01:25:44,809 --> 01:25:46,250
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, chief Sacco.

1201
01:25:47,911 --> 01:26:10,506
[SPEAKER_09]: I think, uh, I think one thing that I think we could look at, um, doing pretty quick and it's similar to what councilor Marks and councilor Lungo said, I'm not so sure the contract, if there's even room for negotiation for total 15 minutes or 30 minutes free, I would love to see it, but realistically, I'm not so sure the contract, that's something we'd be able to achieve through negotiations.

1202
01:26:11,145 --> 01:26:18,408
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we might be able to achieve something, though, where from the time of your expiration, you don't actually get a written ticket.

1203
01:26:18,808 --> 01:26:22,410
[SPEAKER_09]: You give a 10-minute leeway at the end of it before you get that violation.

1204
01:26:23,571 --> 01:26:33,615
[SPEAKER_09]: So similar to a speeding ticket, when you're out tagging and it's 25 miles an hour, I'm not going to say it out loud, but there's a traditional formula they use.

1205
01:26:33,675 --> 01:26:36,096
[SPEAKER_09]: If you go above certain thing over, you know what I'm saying.

1206
01:26:36,997 --> 01:26:37,937
[SPEAKER_09]: With that being said,

1207
01:26:39,056 --> 01:26:51,404
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's something that could give some instant relief and help out, even if we do it for six months, just a 10 minute at the end of the, when it's about to expire.

1208
01:26:51,444 --> 01:26:55,606
[SPEAKER_09]: So if your thing expires 125, Republic doesn't write a ticket until 136.

1209
01:26:56,106 --> 01:26:58,868
[SPEAKER_09]: So you get a 10 minute leeway at the end of it.

1210
01:27:00,249 --> 01:27:02,050
[SPEAKER_09]: We're still going to be turning over the parking.

1211
01:27:02,270 --> 01:27:06,833
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that would have a good intent as far as turning over parking.

1212
01:27:07,362 --> 01:27:13,687
[SPEAKER_09]: not hammering people with tickets, but holding them accountable if they're over the limit by 11, uh, 10 minutes.

1213
01:27:13,727 --> 01:27:22,053
[SPEAKER_09]: And then once they hit that, um, next one, is that something that Republic, I mean, and not talking about contractual, but I think that's something that would make more sense.

1214
01:27:22,994 --> 01:27:35,323
[SPEAKER_09]: And listen, I have to preface it by, I think all of us here would love to see the first 15 minutes of the 30 minutes free, but there's really going to be no way to police that because it's actually, when you're putting the money in the kiosk, that's, what's actually initiating

1215
01:27:35,716 --> 01:27:39,117
[SPEAKER_09]: with all the data and the information technology that you got there at 1 o'clock.

1216
01:27:40,097 --> 01:27:43,617
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're not going to know when the 15 minutes started, when it didn't start.

1217
01:27:43,657 --> 01:27:44,257
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I'm saying?

1218
01:27:44,277 --> 01:27:46,038
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand that.

1219
01:27:46,218 --> 01:27:49,958
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just the way information technology works.

1220
01:27:50,378 --> 01:27:52,559
[SPEAKER_09]: But on the other end, that's something fairly easy.

1221
01:27:52,579 --> 01:27:53,619
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just a training piece.

1222
01:27:54,739 --> 01:28:05,121
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to make a motion that we look for a 10-minute grace period at the end of each thing before a violation is given, at least for a few months.

1223
01:28:05,875 --> 01:28:15,758
[SPEAKER_09]: to get people knowledgeable and even, well actually, I was gonna say give those fake ones out like they were given out, not a fake one, but a zero dollar one.

1224
01:28:16,078 --> 01:28:25,402
[SPEAKER_09]: But I just think that achieves our goal of turning over spots, but it's also holding people accountable with a little breathing room.

1225
01:28:26,722 --> 01:28:28,823
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd like to make that a motion, Mr. President.

1226
01:28:29,223 --> 01:28:33,144
[SPEAKER_18]: So amended by Councilor Camuso that there be a 10 minute grace period.

1227
01:28:33,284 --> 01:28:33,804
[SPEAKER_18]: At the end.

1228
01:28:33,824 --> 01:28:34,685
[SPEAKER_18]: At the end?

1229
01:28:35,125 --> 01:28:35,665
[SPEAKER_18]: At the end.

1230
01:28:36,475 --> 01:28:36,835
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1231
01:28:37,496 --> 01:28:39,037
[SPEAKER_18]: And you make the proper point.

1232
01:28:39,557 --> 01:28:45,702
[SPEAKER_18]: To initiate anything, to get yourself on record, whether you're going to get charged or not, your plate's got to get in the system.

1233
01:28:45,902 --> 01:28:46,423
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

1234
01:28:47,484 --> 01:28:59,313
[SPEAKER_09]: And to Republic, to follow up on that, has any cities and towns done something like that that you're aware of, where you guys would just instruct your people not to write the violation for the 10 minutes?

1235
01:29:01,975 --> 01:29:02,636
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's not on.

1236
01:29:03,516 --> 01:29:04,037
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President.

1237
01:29:04,517 --> 01:29:04,877
[SPEAKER_13]: Go ahead.

1238
01:29:05,018 --> 01:29:05,458
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry.

1239
01:29:07,406 --> 01:29:10,208
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, yeah, typically it's a five minute grace period.

1240
01:29:10,228 --> 01:29:15,091
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of cities, that's basically what our staff has been instructed to do already.

1241
01:29:15,871 --> 01:29:25,497
[SPEAKER_13]: So, and as a matter of operation, uh, identifying someone that hasn't paid and writing the citation is going to take you a matter of time.

1242
01:29:25,577 --> 01:29:29,299
[SPEAKER_13]: So in reality, most people are going to get that grace period.

1243
01:29:29,359 --> 01:29:35,803
[SPEAKER_13]: Our staff has also been instructed if they're in the course of writing a parking citation and someone comes up and approaches them, that the owner of the vehicle,

1244
01:29:36,271 --> 01:29:38,552
[SPEAKER_13]: that we cancel out a citation and they walk away.

1245
01:29:38,652 --> 01:29:47,736
[SPEAKER_13]: So during the course of writing a citation, up until the moment they hit print on the button, which will take our staff approximately 90 seconds to a minute, two minutes to do.

1246
01:29:48,676 --> 01:29:53,778
[SPEAKER_13]: If someone walks up and says, that's my car, that's my car, then we walk away and we don't write the citation.

1247
01:29:53,859 --> 01:29:55,979
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd like to make the motion for the 10 minutes.

1248
01:29:56,039 --> 01:30:00,261
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know now we can initiate, well, we want it 15 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes.

1249
01:30:00,281 --> 01:30:01,682
[SPEAKER_09]: 10 minutes, I think is reasonable when you

1250
01:30:02,562 --> 01:30:08,224
[SPEAKER_09]: when you're running in real quick, just to get the ball rolling, the conversation started between the mayor and the company.

1251
01:30:09,985 --> 01:30:11,606
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of information, Councilor Penta.

1252
01:30:11,866 --> 01:30:13,046
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Nash, question.

1253
01:30:14,227 --> 01:30:27,873
[SPEAKER_11]: Tony, I'm sorry, this is... I'm following this conversation as it relates, I believe he's alluding to using a kiosk, but if I drive down the street and I see a sign that says two-hour parking, and there's no kiosk, there's nothing,

1254
01:30:29,009 --> 01:30:31,911
[SPEAKER_11]: How are you going to know who got there at what time and when?

1255
01:30:32,131 --> 01:30:32,651
[SPEAKER_11]: You're not going to.

1256
01:30:32,991 --> 01:30:33,632
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the whole point.

1257
01:30:36,013 --> 01:30:46,179
[SPEAKER_13]: The license plate recognition cameras, so the license plate LPR camera for short, takes a picture of the car, takes a picture of the license plates, takes the exact GPS coordinate of the vehicle.

1258
01:30:47,279 --> 01:30:48,180
[SPEAKER_13]: We've got it set up.

1259
01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:50,541
[SPEAKER_13]: We've got a program for two hours and 15 minutes.

1260
01:30:50,561 --> 01:30:55,784
[SPEAKER_13]: So even though the sign says two hours, you actually have two hours and 15 minutes in an overtime situation.

1261
01:30:55,964 --> 01:30:57,785
[SPEAKER_13]: That's where any sign, is that what you're saying?

1262
01:30:59,095 --> 01:31:00,235
[SPEAKER_13]: Not a kiosk, a sign.

1263
01:31:00,415 --> 01:31:01,316
[SPEAKER_13]: I understand.

1264
01:31:01,796 --> 01:31:06,597
[SPEAKER_13]: There's 15-minute zones, there's 30-minute zones, there's one-hour zones, and there's two-hour zones.

1265
01:31:06,697 --> 01:31:08,157
[SPEAKER_13]: There's now three-hour zones in the lots.

1266
01:31:08,277 --> 01:31:09,217
[SPEAKER_11]: So they all work the same way.

1267
01:31:09,237 --> 01:31:10,317
[SPEAKER_11]: No matter what it is.

1268
01:31:10,357 --> 01:31:16,359
[SPEAKER_11]: If I drive down the street and I see a half-hour parking area, and there's no kiosk, there's nothing, just the signs, there's a half-hour.

1269
01:31:16,839 --> 01:31:18,659
[SPEAKER_11]: How are you going to know what time I got there?

1270
01:31:19,019 --> 01:31:21,380
[SPEAKER_11]: Because you're driving around the city doing all this other enforcement.

1271
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:22,560
[SPEAKER_13]: I won't know what time you got there.

1272
01:31:22,580 --> 01:31:24,880
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll know what time we chalked your car when we did get there.

1273
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:28,221
[SPEAKER_13]: So you can get there, and we won't get there for another 10 minutes.

1274
01:31:28,940 --> 01:31:32,601
[SPEAKER_13]: And the time starts from the time that we identify that your car is there.

1275
01:31:32,621 --> 01:31:38,522
[SPEAKER_13]: So, yes, I'm not going to know the second that you pull into the spot, but when we drive by your car, that's when the clock starts ticking.

1276
01:31:39,502 --> 01:31:42,563
[SPEAKER_11]: But, Dan, I mean, I could be sitting there for an hour or two before you eventually get there.

1277
01:31:42,623 --> 01:31:43,343
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course you can.

1278
01:31:43,603 --> 01:31:44,043
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.

1279
01:31:44,143 --> 01:31:47,124
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a gamble.

1280
01:31:47,144 --> 01:31:51,625
[SPEAKER_13]: There's only one meter in the world that would be able to do what you're asking to do.

1281
01:31:53,649 --> 01:32:00,294
[SPEAKER_13]: No city in the country actually operates that meter right now because no city will put it in because that is 100% enforcement of every single car.

1282
01:32:00,955 --> 01:32:09,341
[SPEAKER_13]: So there is no parking program in this country that is going to be able to do what you just said is when I park my car, my two hour clock starts ticking right now.

1283
01:32:10,282 --> 01:32:11,423
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just, it's impossible.

1284
01:32:12,003 --> 01:32:15,967
[SPEAKER_13]: So, and that's not a very customer friendly approach to the program.

1285
01:32:15,987 --> 01:32:20,190
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, you pull in when we identify the car, that's when the clock starts.

1286
01:32:21,345 --> 01:32:21,725
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1287
01:32:21,885 --> 01:32:22,786
[SPEAKER_18]: So to counsel, come on.

1288
01:32:22,826 --> 01:32:24,607
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just, I'll wrap up on this point.

1289
01:32:24,727 --> 01:32:32,331
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I'd like to make it so that there's a 10 minute grace period at the end of each expired, um, session.

1290
01:32:33,191 --> 01:32:33,531
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1291
01:32:33,891 --> 01:32:34,212
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1292
01:32:34,572 --> 01:32:35,192
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Knight.

1293
01:32:35,552 --> 01:32:37,033
[SPEAKER_16]: I yield the floor to Mr. D'Antonio.

1294
01:32:37,653 --> 01:32:42,376
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Knight yields the floor to Mr. D'Antonio.

1295
01:32:42,756 --> 01:32:44,337
[SPEAKER_18]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1296
01:32:44,817 --> 01:32:46,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Anthony D'Antonio, 12 Yale street in Medford.

1297
01:32:48,419 --> 01:32:50,520
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, a couple of points I want to make.

1298
01:32:51,055 --> 01:32:53,057
[SPEAKER_07]: And I try not to be redundant on any of them.

1299
01:32:53,717 --> 01:33:04,226
[SPEAKER_07]: But I was on the way home this evening, passing the South Medford Square, and I noticed a decrease in the amount of vehicles out in front of the stores, from Alexander Avenue to Yale Street.

1300
01:33:05,227 --> 01:33:06,268
[SPEAKER_07]: A really big decrease.

1301
01:33:06,428 --> 01:33:09,531
[SPEAKER_07]: And usually when I drive by there, they're loaded, they're crowded.

1302
01:33:09,811 --> 01:33:11,552
[SPEAKER_07]: Even on my street, there's people there parked.

1303
01:33:12,695 --> 01:33:32,607
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if they would, Tuesday night is always a busy night down there with the Oasis and with Pacelli's, but I got home and I received a phone call, a reverse 911 call from Captain Clemente indicating that we will have three public and police, we're going to have the three meetings discussing the parking situation.

1304
01:33:33,212 --> 01:33:34,813
[SPEAKER_07]: at the Academy, if I'm not mistaken.

1305
01:33:35,653 --> 01:33:37,974
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's going to be at the Academy, I believe.

1306
01:33:39,895 --> 01:33:44,977
[SPEAKER_07]: I was in a rush to get out and I was listening to Clemente leave the message there.

1307
01:33:45,857 --> 01:34:00,662
[SPEAKER_07]: My point is that a good effort on the part of the Medford police in trying to do this, but I still say wholeheartedly that the meeting should be taken here and that the mayor should be here to answer the questions.

1308
01:34:01,203 --> 01:34:01,963
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing gets done.

1309
01:34:02,798 --> 01:34:06,520
[SPEAKER_07]: The point doesn't get across unless he is here taking the heat on this.

1310
01:34:06,620 --> 01:34:19,026
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, when, where's the surprise when, who didn't think this was going to happen after he went mute on the parking proposals put by your committee that you had, nothing was done.

1311
01:34:19,086 --> 01:34:19,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing was done.

1312
01:34:19,686 --> 01:34:24,109
[SPEAKER_07]: Then all of a sudden it comes in with a guillotine and we got this parking program.

1313
01:34:24,149 --> 01:34:25,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Now you want to raise revenue.

1314
01:34:25,589 --> 01:34:26,670
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to put parking meters there.

1315
01:34:26,690 --> 01:34:30,612
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't want, this is not a kiosk city unless you put them in the, in the parking lots and then you have,

1316
01:34:31,148 --> 01:34:32,689
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't need to put your license plate in.

1317
01:34:32,709 --> 01:34:33,770
[SPEAKER_07]: They can run a piece of paper.

1318
01:34:34,590 --> 01:34:47,159
[SPEAKER_07]: And they have a software that says, OK, you're a young person.

1319
01:34:50,861 --> 01:34:59,407
[SPEAKER_07]: The thing that I have a question of is, when this was being negotiated, didn't anybody from the finance department, budget director, or the purchasing department

1320
01:35:00,227 --> 01:35:06,469
[SPEAKER_07]: get an idea that this was going up towards a million dollars on behalf of the city to put forward this program?

1321
01:35:06,529 --> 01:35:09,871
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if it's a million dollars, it normally is going to take a three year contract.

1322
01:35:09,911 --> 01:35:15,953
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it's time for the city to say, okay, thanks for the time you put into this, but this is not for us.

1323
01:35:16,513 --> 01:35:17,914
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to find a different solution.

1324
01:35:18,374 --> 01:35:19,714
[SPEAKER_07]: There are other solutions out there.

1325
01:35:20,234 --> 01:35:23,115
[SPEAKER_07]: And unfortunately it requires a lot of personnel on the ground.

1326
01:35:23,876 --> 01:35:26,917
[SPEAKER_07]: And it also requires a mayor who can get the money from one

1327
01:35:27,776 --> 01:35:32,399
[SPEAKER_07]: and put into a budget where we need public safety officers, we need DPW people.

1328
01:35:32,419 --> 01:35:38,263
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there's a lot of things that can be done, but this just doesn't, and there's nothing against the Republic Parking System.

1329
01:35:38,283 --> 01:35:39,164
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, they're all good people.

1330
01:35:39,184 --> 01:35:43,967
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a bottom line they have to meet, but this is always the way the city runs.

1331
01:35:44,908 --> 01:35:56,476
[SPEAKER_07]: The mayor doesn't like what some people do, and he comes up with his own plan, and then he, you know, he hits Mrs. Murphy's car on the rear wrench, opens the pond door, and you guys are all chasing the car down the street as well as the citizens.

1332
01:35:56,974 --> 01:35:58,414
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's the wrong way to run a city.

1333
01:35:59,495 --> 01:36:03,576
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's because this charter has not been reviewed for 30 years in the city of Medford.

1334
01:36:04,196 --> 01:36:05,456
[SPEAKER_07]: There's absolute power in there.

1335
01:36:06,077 --> 01:36:12,658
[SPEAKER_07]: And to expect anything else, like Charlie Brown always thought that Lucy was going to hold the football when he goes to kick it, but she always moves it.

1336
01:36:13,019 --> 01:36:14,259
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what we have with this mayor.

1337
01:36:15,579 --> 01:36:17,300
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't get what we're paying for here.

1338
01:36:17,340 --> 01:36:18,360
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to change that.

1339
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:20,521
[SPEAKER_07]: And people have to be made aware of that.

1340
01:36:20,541 --> 01:36:22,221
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got to stop all this.

1341
01:36:23,762 --> 01:36:24,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, never mind.

1342
01:36:24,842 --> 01:36:25,082
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

1343
01:36:26,177 --> 01:36:32,242
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope that the people understand that there are a lot of pros and cons with these things.

1344
01:36:32,282 --> 01:36:36,205
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've seen a lot of people having difficulty, a lot of difficulty with the kiosks.

1345
01:36:36,825 --> 01:36:42,270
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a hell of a lot easier to put a quarter and a card, a credit card in those things.

1346
01:36:42,990 --> 01:36:53,238
[SPEAKER_07]: And one thing I think I heard one of the representatives from Republic say that the information is secure when you put your license plate number in there.

1347
01:36:53,438 --> 01:36:55,700
[SPEAKER_07]: And I strongly disagree with that.

1348
01:36:57,088 --> 01:37:06,033
[SPEAKER_07]: There is no information that's secure once it goes into the cloud, or it goes into the airways, or it goes into the software, because there are companies out there that do this particularly.

1349
01:37:06,993 --> 01:37:15,338
[SPEAKER_07]: I could take Mr. Nash up to a place in New Hampshire and show him his own company in a particular data aggregator, and they won't even know that they're being looked at.

1350
01:37:16,318 --> 01:37:19,560
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have a feeling that it's not their fault.

1351
01:37:19,620 --> 01:37:21,081
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just the way the society is today.

1352
01:37:21,741 --> 01:37:25,223
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, I really hope that— Point of information?

1353
01:37:29,867 --> 01:37:33,370
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no, no, no.

1354
01:37:33,650 --> 01:37:41,257
[SPEAKER_07]: To give you an example, Groupon sells coupons for golf memberships and causes special discounts.

1355
01:37:41,677 --> 01:37:45,641
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you can go up there and they can go right into their system and see who's signing the coupons.

1356
01:37:46,715 --> 01:37:54,457
[SPEAKER_07]: So what happens is you manufacture golf clubs, you come to me, I sell you a list, the people that are buying the memberships to the golf course.

1357
01:37:54,677 --> 01:37:56,338
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it's in our contract though.

1358
01:37:56,358 --> 01:38:01,459
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe Councilor Penta, I don't know if he stated it, that they cannot use this information.

1359
01:38:01,479 --> 01:38:02,280
[SPEAKER_07]: They can't sell it.

1360
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:02,580
[SPEAKER_09]: They can't.

1361
01:38:02,620 --> 01:38:02,940
[SPEAKER_07]: They won't.

1362
01:38:03,040 --> 01:38:03,500
[SPEAKER_09]: They won't use it.

1363
01:38:03,779 --> 01:38:07,301
[SPEAKER_09]: Because no, you just said Mr. Nash, his company in Republic in New Hampshire.

1364
01:38:07,321 --> 01:38:08,282
[SPEAKER_09]: You said someone has their data.

1365
01:38:08,342 --> 01:38:12,665
[SPEAKER_07]: I said I could take you to a company in New Hampshire that does this, and they could go into the site.

1366
01:38:12,685 --> 01:38:15,086
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, because I misunderstood it.

1367
01:38:15,106 --> 01:38:21,611
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought you knew something, and I was going to tell you to call the FBI if that was the case, with all the stuff going on in today's day and age.

1368
01:38:21,671 --> 01:38:25,693
[SPEAKER_07]: I just think a little more consideration on behalf of the mayor should have been taken for the people in the city of Medford.

1369
01:38:25,934 --> 01:38:26,614
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, Anthony.

1370
01:38:26,634 --> 01:38:29,436
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought you said that I misinterpreted what you said.

1371
01:38:29,834 --> 01:38:30,515
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's out there.

1372
01:38:30,555 --> 01:38:31,415
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, these are companies.

1373
01:38:31,435 --> 01:38:33,977
[SPEAKER_07]: They pay big money for people to come in and do this, to do the software.

1374
01:38:33,997 --> 01:38:37,280
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, they have computers that will fill this room, and that's all they do.

1375
01:38:37,580 --> 01:38:38,421
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how they make their money.

1376
01:38:38,441 --> 01:38:43,185
[SPEAKER_07]: You've probably seen emails that should come to your email address that you have no idea how they got there.

1377
01:38:43,265 --> 01:38:43,925
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how it happened.

1378
01:38:43,945 --> 01:38:45,086
[SPEAKER_07]: They sell the list.

1379
01:38:45,767 --> 01:38:46,748
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thank you, and good luck.

1380
01:38:47,869 --> 01:38:48,149
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1381
01:38:48,169 --> 01:38:48,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1382
01:38:49,790 --> 01:38:50,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight?

1383
01:38:50,951 --> 01:38:53,393
[SPEAKER_21]: Again, I yield the floor to any citizen who'd like to speak, Mr. President.

1384
01:38:54,634 --> 01:38:55,054
[SPEAKER_21]: Good evening.

1385
01:38:55,074 --> 01:38:55,655
[SPEAKER_21]: How you doing?

1386
01:38:56,596 --> 01:39:00,098
[SPEAKER_21]: John Kostas, Medford Electronics, 25 Salem Street in Medford.

1387
01:39:00,858 --> 01:39:06,540
[SPEAKER_21]: Of course, I'm also a past president of the Chamber of Commerce, but I'm not here for the Chamber of Commerce.

1388
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:20,225
[SPEAKER_21]: I represent some of the people in our block of stores, and yeah, there's—I can watch people use the kiosk, and yes, there is issues, especially, you know, older people do have a hard time running the cart and so forth.

1389
01:39:23,702 --> 01:39:28,124
[SPEAKER_21]: It has really been, and I wasn't thrilled about the kiosks.

1390
01:39:28,925 --> 01:39:32,746
[SPEAKER_21]: I would rather see parking enforcement in the square versus kiosks or meters.

1391
01:39:33,447 --> 01:39:34,327
[SPEAKER_21]: But we didn't get that.

1392
01:39:36,108 --> 01:39:37,429
[SPEAKER_21]: Either way, it's wonderful.

1393
01:39:38,229 --> 01:39:42,051
[SPEAKER_21]: Right now, my customers can pull in, and some of them take a chance.

1394
01:39:42,091 --> 01:39:43,671
[SPEAKER_21]: They won't put a quarter in the meter.

1395
01:39:43,792 --> 01:39:47,253
[SPEAKER_21]: They'll run in, run out, and they'll take a chance if they get a ticket or not.

1396
01:39:48,034 --> 01:39:51,015
[SPEAKER_21]: But in Medford Square, sometimes it looks like a ghost town.

1397
01:39:51,610 --> 01:39:56,093
[SPEAKER_21]: because there's so many places to park, you can fly in and fly out.

1398
01:39:57,794 --> 01:40:04,257
[SPEAKER_21]: So I know at some of the meetings I've been to where I'll be public, they're making all kinds of changes to this program.

1399
01:40:05,698 --> 01:40:09,801
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't think there's any one program that everybody in the entire city is going to want.

1400
01:40:10,781 --> 01:40:20,827
[SPEAKER_21]: I guarantee you, if they weren't kiosks or meters and it was enforced parking, you'd have a whole bunch of people saying, why aren't you doing it the right way and doing it with, you know,

1401
01:40:21,658 --> 01:40:25,480
[SPEAKER_21]: The other way, you know, either meet them eight or the kiosks.

1402
01:40:26,680 --> 01:40:32,363
[SPEAKER_21]: So I don't know how much you can go after this over and over again, because it just keeps going on and on.

1403
01:40:32,463 --> 01:40:36,164
[SPEAKER_21]: And nobody's going to be happy at all with this program whatsoever.

1404
01:40:37,545 --> 01:40:39,426
[SPEAKER_21]: But it's working for me in Medford Square.

1405
01:40:40,386 --> 01:40:44,768
[SPEAKER_21]: If they extend it, there's a few things I'd like to see changed, and they're changing them.

1406
01:40:45,788 --> 01:40:49,770
[SPEAKER_21]: But I would like to thank, though, the Chamber of Commerce, because I'm

1407
01:40:50,406 --> 01:40:51,747
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm just a chamber member.

1408
01:40:52,087 --> 01:40:54,448
[SPEAKER_21]: I pay my dues like 300 other people do.

1409
01:40:55,448 --> 01:41:02,392
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, but they've been keeping me informed by emails and stuff of what's going on, how's it going on and what's happening.

1410
01:41:03,152 --> 01:41:16,118
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'd like to thank the chamber for taking that step forward to help me implement a program that not everybody, um, not everybody likes, but I think it's here to stay and I think we're stuck with it.

1411
01:41:16,538 --> 01:41:17,219
[SPEAKER_21]: So thank you.

1412
01:41:17,779 --> 01:41:18,339
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, sir.

1413
01:41:19,200 --> 01:41:19,800
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Marks.

1414
01:41:21,466 --> 01:41:22,507
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll yield, Mr. President.

1415
01:41:25,550 --> 01:41:25,990
[SPEAKER_18]: Good evening.

1416
01:41:26,190 --> 01:41:27,932
[SPEAKER_08]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1417
01:41:30,034 --> 01:41:30,414
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening.

1418
01:41:30,494 --> 01:41:32,856
[SPEAKER_08]: Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave, Medford, Mass.

1419
01:41:33,337 --> 01:41:40,903
[SPEAKER_08]: I was over at Haines Square a couple of times, two different storefronts, and I talked to both of these store owners, and people are outraged.

1420
01:41:41,403 --> 01:41:46,548
[SPEAKER_08]: Sunday, there was a fellow trying to put money in the meter, so I parked my car over near the iSight place.

1421
01:41:47,479 --> 01:41:52,521
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, Nancy salon, I was over there and I went over and I talked to the fellow and I said, you don't have to put your money.

1422
01:41:52,541 --> 01:41:55,082
[SPEAKER_08]: And I showed him, you know, Monday through Saturday.

1423
01:41:55,102 --> 01:41:57,123
[SPEAKER_08]: And he goes, oh, and he was just outraged.

1424
01:41:57,503 --> 01:41:58,563
[SPEAKER_08]: He said, you can't read it.

1425
01:41:59,223 --> 01:42:01,104
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to put my personal information in.

1426
01:42:01,704 --> 01:42:03,425
[SPEAKER_08]: I go into the stores, they're all flustered.

1427
01:42:03,485 --> 01:42:05,426
[SPEAKER_08]: So John Costas, you're a great guy.

1428
01:42:06,186 --> 01:42:06,946
[SPEAKER_08]: You're really great guy.

1429
01:42:06,966 --> 01:42:10,648
[SPEAKER_08]: You do a great job with the Chevalier, but I strongly disagree with you, man.

1430
01:42:11,348 --> 01:42:16,750
[SPEAKER_08]: The people I'm talking to 100%, except for Mr. White and Mr. Costas, both with the chamber of commerce.

1431
01:42:17,383 --> 01:42:24,287
[SPEAKER_08]: 100% of the people out there in the community are just really, really outraged, and people want more meetings here.

1432
01:42:24,327 --> 01:42:25,568
[SPEAKER_08]: They want to come out and speak.

1433
01:42:26,068 --> 01:42:26,989
[SPEAKER_08]: I got some texts.

1434
01:42:27,529 --> 01:42:28,330
[SPEAKER_08]: I invited some people.

1435
01:42:28,370 --> 01:42:29,130
[SPEAKER_08]: They were here tonight.

1436
01:42:30,151 --> 01:42:31,532
[SPEAKER_08]: People want the discussion.

1437
01:42:31,572 --> 01:42:37,155
[SPEAKER_08]: So, John, it's going to go on and on because we have to pay that 800 grand and get them out of here.

1438
01:42:37,816 --> 01:42:38,976
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a ghost town out there.

1439
01:42:39,036 --> 01:42:40,357
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not a vibrant community.

1440
01:42:40,937 --> 01:42:42,979
[SPEAKER_08]: The streets are fractured, and there's litter everywhere.

1441
01:42:43,059 --> 01:42:45,040
[SPEAKER_08]: Why would people want to pay to come to this community?

1442
01:42:50,875 --> 01:42:53,636
[SPEAKER_16]: I yield to the woman who would like to speak.

1443
01:42:55,516 --> 01:42:56,697
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Victoria Hunt.

1444
01:42:57,237 --> 01:43:00,217
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would just like to add to the fact that it is a ghost town out there.

1445
01:43:00,938 --> 01:43:04,458
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are not going to pay to park to go to the small businesses.

1446
01:43:05,139 --> 01:43:09,180
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to keep right on trucking and go right around the little roadie to Arlington.

1447
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:11,980
[SPEAKER_00]: Hunt, H-U-N-T.

1448
01:43:13,801 --> 01:43:16,081
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where they're going to go, because there's no meters there.

1449
01:43:16,141 --> 01:43:17,422
[SPEAKER_00]: And the business there is booming.

1450
01:43:17,462 --> 01:43:18,922
[SPEAKER_00]: And business in Medford is, shh.

1451
01:43:29,125 --> 01:43:29,765
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion?

1452
01:43:29,785 --> 01:43:32,006
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to leave this open.

1453
01:43:32,066 --> 01:43:32,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President?

1454
01:43:35,148 --> 01:43:37,309
[SPEAKER_18]: We have it so with several amendments.

1455
01:43:37,549 --> 01:43:38,389
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Knight.

1456
01:43:39,449 --> 01:43:40,850
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1457
01:43:41,911 --> 01:43:46,512
[SPEAKER_15]: I think based upon what we're hearing today, we can all agree that the plan is not perfect.

1458
01:43:47,273 --> 01:43:49,654
[SPEAKER_15]: This is not a perfect plan and we all know that.

1459
01:43:50,654 --> 01:43:52,395
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think the reason that

1460
01:43:53,207 --> 01:43:58,511
[SPEAKER_15]: there's so much frustration is because the lack of transparency in the process in establishing this plan, Mr. President.

1461
01:43:58,891 --> 01:44:11,141
[SPEAKER_15]: And because the process wasn't open and transparent, now we're in the situation we're in where there are a lot of questions, and it seems like there's a lot of reaction and reactivity versus being proactive and proactivity.

1462
01:44:12,242 --> 01:44:16,665
[SPEAKER_15]: Chief Sacco's done an excellent job, Mr. President, I feel, in addressing the concerns of the general public.

1463
01:44:16,705 --> 01:44:18,507
[SPEAKER_15]: He's been out there, and he's been working very hard on this.

1464
01:44:18,967 --> 01:44:22,590
[SPEAKER_15]: As Councilman Locke said, he right now is the face of this program, and there's no question about it.

1465
01:44:23,451 --> 01:44:34,021
[SPEAKER_15]: He's been working far too many hours, in my opinion, on establishing a parking management program and a little less on making sure that the other essential functions of our police department are up and running.

1466
01:44:34,401 --> 01:44:37,864
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that this is almost becoming a distraction at this point in time, Mr. President.

1467
01:44:38,465 --> 01:44:41,467
[SPEAKER_15]: But I guess the question is, where do we go from here?

1468
01:44:42,188 --> 01:44:43,369
[SPEAKER_15]: And what are our options from here?

1469
01:44:44,009 --> 01:44:48,073
[SPEAKER_15]: And in looking at the situation, we can go forward as the plan's presented.

1470
01:44:48,768 --> 01:44:49,328
[SPEAKER_15]: It is what it is.

1471
01:44:50,569 --> 01:44:56,052
[SPEAKER_15]: We can work towards trying to get the contract bought out and eliminate the contract, but I don't think that that's going to happen.

1472
01:44:56,092 --> 01:44:57,733
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think that's a reality of the situation.

1473
01:44:57,773 --> 01:45:00,294
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think that that's something we're going to be able to be successful with.

1474
01:45:01,195 --> 01:45:08,359
[SPEAKER_15]: However, I think that over the past three weeks, we have been very successful at moving this project and this plan towards something that everybody can live with.

1475
01:45:09,179 --> 01:45:16,063
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, I think that if we're going to make a commitment to parking enforcement or the parking management plan that's in place, we've seen

1476
01:45:17,815 --> 01:45:23,840
[SPEAKER_15]: people from Republic that have been willing to work with us, we've seen the Traffic Commission that's taking our concerns very seriously, Mr. President.

1477
01:45:24,280 --> 01:45:38,551
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think that in looking at what our best option is, our best option is to continue the discussion, to continue the dialogue, to keep this issue here at the table, to keep the Committee of the Whole open so that we can continue to make changes to the existing plan so that we can have a successful downtown.

1478
01:45:38,991 --> 01:45:42,814
[SPEAKER_15]: And when I look at the plan, I think that there are some other areas that we need to look at, Mr. President.

1479
01:45:43,342 --> 01:45:54,407
[SPEAKER_15]: And if we want to make this work, we need to take a look at the comprehensive zoning that we have in our downtown business areas to ensure that we're attracting sustainable businesses based upon the zoning regulations and ordinances that we have in place right now.

1480
01:45:55,127 --> 01:46:09,513
[SPEAKER_15]: I also think it's important that, because this is a parking management plan, it might be very suitable for us to take a look at what we can do to take cars off the road and to improve pedestrian-oriented transit and multimodal transportation down in our business district, Mr. President.

1481
01:46:09,951 --> 01:46:17,232
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think the proper course of action for us to move forward at this point in time would be to continue this discussion to talk about what changes that we can continue to make.

1482
01:46:17,252 --> 01:46:21,733
[SPEAKER_15]: We've been very successful over the past three weeks in addressing the concerns that have been brought to us.

1483
01:46:22,113 --> 01:46:28,435
[SPEAKER_15]: Thankfully, the people from our public and the chief have been willing to work with us and have been very, very patient in addressing our concerns.

1484
01:46:28,475 --> 01:46:34,616
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that we've been patient because of the frustrations and the lack of open, transparent process that's been in place.

1485
01:46:35,036 --> 01:46:37,977
[SPEAKER_15]: We need to ask the residents to be patient because we're getting responses.

1486
01:46:38,077 --> 01:46:39,737
[SPEAKER_15]: We're moving in the right direction, Mr. President.

1487
01:46:40,019 --> 01:46:48,505
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think, you know, based upon the options that we have here before us, it's in our best interest to keep the paper before the council to keep it open and to continue the dialogue and continue the conversation.

1488
01:46:48,745 --> 01:46:49,806
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you on that motion.

1489
01:46:49,886 --> 01:46:57,812
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor, if I can, from the chair state that we have within this motion, which is before us, I have a number 15 22.

1490
01:46:57,972 --> 01:47:05,678
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, we have a resolution that calls for ongoing discussion.

1491
01:47:06,220 --> 01:47:26,372
[SPEAKER_18]: you've called for ongoing discussion yet within it, we have an amended to, uh, which will require action, um, a referendum on the plan that really, uh, quite frankly, as I see it, uh, as the chairman to be highly ontologically challenged.

1492
01:47:27,273 --> 01:47:35,878
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, I think that, uh, we also have a amendment by council Camuso for a, um, uh, ruling.

1493
01:47:36,580 --> 01:47:45,322
[SPEAKER_18]: on the content of the votes by the city clerk, um, which was also at my recommendation for the clerk's impartiality on the matter.

1494
01:47:45,902 --> 01:47:49,362
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, Mr. Clerk, if you could also share with us what else you have in hand.

1495
01:47:50,302 --> 01:47:53,203
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, we have an amendment, uh, from council current.

1496
01:47:53,223 --> 01:48:01,945
[SPEAKER_19]: Let me see, uh, on if the machines can be shut down, uh, or the kiosk machines be shut down at the, uh, uh, closing period.

1497
01:48:02,565 --> 01:48:02,965
[SPEAKER_19]: Very good.

1498
01:48:02,985 --> 01:48:03,285
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

1499
01:48:04,899 --> 01:48:06,581
[SPEAKER_18]: so that they don't accept anything.

1500
01:48:06,681 --> 01:48:11,885
[SPEAKER_18]: And on Sunday, so they don't accept money on those times.

1501
01:48:12,025 --> 01:48:27,759
[SPEAKER_18]: And also councilor Camuso had a before us the matter of, um, that there'd be a 10 minute grace period at the end of the paid for, uh, period in the kiosk that at the termination.

1502
01:48:27,819 --> 01:48:31,923
[SPEAKER_18]: So if somebody paid for a half hour of parking that

1503
01:48:32,514 --> 01:48:38,237
[SPEAKER_18]: an additional 10 minutes be granted to them at the termination of that half hour before free before they get it.

1504
01:48:38,317 --> 01:48:40,518
[SPEAKER_18]: No, before they get a ticket, before they get a ticket.

1505
01:48:42,099 --> 01:48:51,124
[SPEAKER_18]: So with all those, uh, amendments, there was 30 minute free parking came from hope.

1506
01:48:52,005 --> 01:48:55,847
[SPEAKER_18]: My apologies, Councilor Marks off at 30 minutes free parking.

1507
01:48:56,507 --> 01:49:01,670
[SPEAKER_18]: So, um, so we have these five amendments that require action.

1508
01:49:02,461 --> 01:49:06,124
[SPEAKER_18]: while we're asking for the main motion to stay fluid.

1509
01:49:06,624 --> 01:49:13,029
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm wondering if a councilor would like to separate, make a motion to separate all these issues so we can.

1510
01:49:13,069 --> 01:49:13,790
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion to sever.

1511
01:49:15,351 --> 01:49:15,712
[SPEAKER_18]: Sever.

1512
01:49:15,992 --> 01:49:16,632
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Penta.

1513
01:49:16,672 --> 01:49:17,373
[SPEAKER_11]: Why would you want to sever it?

1514
01:49:17,393 --> 01:49:18,274
[SPEAKER_11]: Why don't you just include it?

1515
01:49:18,294 --> 01:49:20,555
[SPEAKER_11]: Because when you have the discussion next week, you'll have your answers.

1516
01:49:22,557 --> 01:49:28,922
[SPEAKER_18]: You're one asked to keep the thing opened and the others all require action to be acted upon.

1517
01:49:29,424 --> 01:49:33,467
[SPEAKER_18]: So you can't keep something open and ongoing while at the same time asking for action.

1518
01:49:33,487 --> 01:49:36,149
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, all you're keeping open is the conversations you're going to be able to have.

1519
01:49:37,090 --> 01:49:38,331
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what the resolution would say.

1520
01:49:38,411 --> 01:49:40,312
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would be willing to.

1521
01:49:41,133 --> 01:49:42,554
[SPEAKER_11]: That doesn't make sense to me, Councilor.

1522
01:49:42,574 --> 01:49:42,994
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, why doesn't it?

1523
01:49:43,115 --> 01:49:45,256
[SPEAKER_11]: I have some amendments that I'd like to put forward.

1524
01:49:45,977 --> 01:49:48,419
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, then this will be tremendously amended then.

1525
01:49:48,939 --> 01:49:50,861
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, whether it's amended or not, what difference does it make?

1526
01:49:51,101 --> 01:49:52,762
[SPEAKER_11]: It's part of the ongoing discussion, Fred.

1527
01:49:53,162 --> 01:49:53,643
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all there is.

1528
01:49:53,663 --> 01:49:53,923
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1529
01:49:55,864 --> 01:49:59,147
[SPEAKER_18]: What I'm saying is that these amendments can't continue

1530
01:49:59,836 --> 01:50:01,317
[SPEAKER_18]: within an ongoing discussion.

1531
01:50:01,357 --> 01:50:04,379
[SPEAKER_18]: They need to be acted upon as separate motions.

1532
01:50:05,239 --> 01:50:06,880
[SPEAKER_18]: Each one of them is going to be a separate motion?

1533
01:50:07,560 --> 01:50:10,782
[SPEAKER_18]: Should they not be, Councilor Long-Term, Madam Vice-President?

1534
01:50:10,842 --> 01:50:17,286
[SPEAKER_04]: All together, but it's counterproductive to Councilor Pente's resolved vote for or against the program.

1535
01:50:18,786 --> 01:50:21,068
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that needs to be voted on at a later time.

1536
01:50:21,706 --> 01:50:23,647
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe none of these changes are getting implemented.

1537
01:50:24,207 --> 01:50:24,627
[SPEAKER_18]: Very good.

1538
01:50:24,647 --> 01:50:25,488
[SPEAKER_18]: That's a great point.

1539
01:50:25,508 --> 01:50:28,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully the mayor hears this loud and clear, and we won't have to vote on that.

1540
01:50:28,729 --> 01:50:37,914
[SPEAKER_18]: So the motion that you've brought to us for a referendum on this program, uh, councillor, uh, would you kindly withdraw that motion?

1541
01:50:38,094 --> 01:50:39,975
[SPEAKER_11]: No, just table it until you get the answer.

1542
01:50:40,695 --> 01:50:42,436
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion to table the amendment?

1543
01:50:42,856 --> 01:50:43,877
[SPEAKER_18]: Until it's, until, no.

1544
01:50:44,637 --> 01:50:45,677
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President.

1545
01:50:45,697 --> 01:50:46,158
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President.

1546
01:50:47,138 --> 01:50:48,799
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Camuso.

1547
01:50:48,899 --> 01:50:50,860
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight brought this up in the past too.

1548
01:50:52,775 --> 01:50:58,843
[SPEAKER_09]: If something's going to be under suspension, every member of this council should have the courtesy of at least seeing it and signing off on it.

1549
01:50:58,863 --> 01:51:01,086
[SPEAKER_09]: This wasn't under suspension, Paul.

1550
01:51:01,126 --> 01:51:02,949
[SPEAKER_09]: No, the other paper that you just handed to him.

1551
01:51:02,969 --> 01:51:03,850
[SPEAKER_04]: It was an amendment.

1552
01:51:03,930 --> 01:51:04,491
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an amendment.

1553
01:51:04,511 --> 01:51:05,152
[SPEAKER_04]: We do this all the time.

1554
01:51:05,212 --> 01:51:05,953
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand the amendment.

1555
01:51:10,806 --> 01:51:13,269
[SPEAKER_09]: Did he give you, I thought it was an original, he said it was 15-032.

1556
01:51:13,990 --> 01:51:19,095
[SPEAKER_18]: He presented to me as a motion separate from this.

1557
01:51:20,376 --> 01:51:21,818
[SPEAKER_18]: Him giving its own number.

1558
01:51:22,158 --> 01:51:23,099
[SPEAKER_18]: Hence my point.

1559
01:51:23,300 --> 01:51:24,721
[SPEAKER_18]: Not the clerk giving it a number.

1560
01:51:24,901 --> 01:51:26,043
[SPEAKER_18]: That's my point, Mr. President.

1561
01:51:26,063 --> 01:51:31,449
[SPEAKER_18]: My point is that I'm asking that that amendment be withdrawn.

1562
01:51:32,159 --> 01:51:32,419
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1563
01:51:32,479 --> 01:51:41,705
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was my point, Mr. President, because when anything goes under suspension for many members of these council, any member of the council, we all see it, we initial it and then give it in.

1564
01:51:41,925 --> 01:51:42,885
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't a suspension.

1565
01:51:42,905 --> 01:51:48,449
[SPEAKER_09]: When it was given a number earlier, one would assume that it was under suspension and that we didn't sign off on it.

1566
01:51:48,709 --> 01:51:52,831
[SPEAKER_18]: It couldn't be accepted as a, uh, you see my, you see what I was saying?

1567
01:51:52,871 --> 01:51:56,994
[SPEAKER_18]: We've had many, we've had many resolutions to give many resolutions.

1568
01:51:57,814 --> 01:51:58,855
[SPEAKER_09]: We've had many resolutions.

1569
01:51:58,875 --> 01:52:00,676
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I said, just moving forward.

1570
01:52:01,347 --> 01:52:03,588
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything under suspension, I think we should all see.

1571
01:52:03,748 --> 01:52:06,269
[SPEAKER_11]: We've had many resolutions that are amended on the floor.

1572
01:52:06,629 --> 01:52:09,130
[SPEAKER_09]: Amended on the floor, but not given to the city clerk with a number.

1573
01:52:09,250 --> 01:52:10,951
[SPEAKER_09]: I said, he read my resolution.

1574
01:52:11,051 --> 01:52:11,491
[SPEAKER_11]: With a number on it.

1575
01:52:11,511 --> 01:52:13,032
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I said, as amended.

1576
01:52:13,052 --> 01:52:15,293
[SPEAKER_11]: As amended, and I handed it to him.

1577
01:52:15,353 --> 01:52:16,653
[SPEAKER_18]: So we've accepted it as an amendment.

1578
01:52:16,793 --> 01:52:21,775
[SPEAKER_18]: Originally, though, my question is, yeah, right, yes, yeah, right.

1579
01:52:21,815 --> 01:52:27,397
[SPEAKER_18]: But can we leave that table, or do we have to withdraw it when we're acting on the rest of the budget?

1580
01:52:27,417 --> 01:52:28,878
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's withdraw it and see how the answer is.

1581
01:52:29,467 --> 01:52:34,188
[SPEAKER_11]: Before we go any further, before we get to that, I want to go back to the amendments that we're discussing here right now.

1582
01:52:35,048 --> 01:52:40,290
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to go to indicate that on, is Mr. Nash, you're still here?

1583
01:52:40,670 --> 01:52:40,950
[SPEAKER_11]: Dan.

1584
01:52:50,812 --> 01:52:54,113
[SPEAKER_11]: Are the cars, the two cars that you have right now, are they lettered yet properly?

1585
01:52:54,613 --> 01:52:55,053
[SPEAKER_11]: Are they done?

1586
01:52:55,393 --> 01:52:55,673
[SPEAKER_11]: Pardon me?

1587
01:52:55,953 --> 01:52:56,794
[SPEAKER_11]: Nope.

1588
01:52:57,214 --> 01:52:57,434
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1589
01:52:57,654 --> 01:52:58,514
[SPEAKER_11]: And have they been used?

1590
01:52:59,167 --> 01:53:02,008
[SPEAKER_11]: recently for the purposes of issuing tickets?

1591
01:53:02,708 --> 01:53:02,889
[SPEAKER_11]: Nope.

1592
01:53:03,389 --> 01:53:03,689
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1593
01:53:04,229 --> 01:53:10,051
[SPEAKER_11]: And when we met, I believe it was on this past Friday, you indicated that the cars would not be used for that particular purpose.

1594
01:53:10,412 --> 01:53:13,913
[SPEAKER_11]: They would just be driving your drivers around and they would be getting out and doing what they're doing.

1595
01:53:14,193 --> 01:53:14,433
[SPEAKER_13]: Correct.

1596
01:53:14,473 --> 01:53:16,874
[SPEAKER_13]: The cameras are disengaged and the computers are off.

1597
01:53:16,974 --> 01:53:17,094
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1598
01:53:18,215 --> 01:53:23,397
[SPEAKER_11]: I move that the dates of January 15th and January 16th, any tickets and issued

1599
01:53:25,387 --> 01:53:43,040
[SPEAKER_11]: You amend the amended further with another amendment, further amended by Councilor Penta that the tickets issued on the January 15th and especially January 15th where the cars were unlicensed, unregistered and unserved checked and unleaded, uh, not be, uh, be waived.

1600
01:53:44,021 --> 01:53:45,602
[SPEAKER_11]: And same thing for the 16th.

1601
01:53:46,963 --> 01:53:50,826
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and also number two, there was no clarity into what you just said.

1602
01:53:50,886 --> 01:53:51,287
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor.

1603
01:53:51,347 --> 01:53:51,567
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1604
01:53:52,027 --> 01:53:52,808
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't understand it.

1605
01:53:53,872 --> 01:53:55,955
[SPEAKER_11]: And the 16th, the same for the 15th and the 16th.

1606
01:53:56,636 --> 01:54:05,348
[SPEAKER_11]: Any tickets that they issued be invalid, because they were used in a car that wasn't properly marked, insured, registered, and inspected.

1607
01:54:06,931 --> 01:54:09,915
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the third time he said that the cars were not insured or registered.

1608
01:54:10,173 --> 01:54:10,853
[SPEAKER_13]: They weren't insured.

1609
01:54:10,913 --> 01:54:12,094
[SPEAKER_13]: When were they insured?

1610
01:54:12,374 --> 01:54:12,774
[SPEAKER_13]: They were insured.

1611
01:54:12,794 --> 01:54:14,135
[SPEAKER_13]: I can get you the documentation if you want.

1612
01:54:14,155 --> 01:54:15,175
[SPEAKER_11]: What day were they insured, Dan?

1613
01:54:15,435 --> 01:54:16,236
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have that documentation.

1614
01:54:16,256 --> 01:54:16,776
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't have it.

1615
01:54:17,016 --> 01:54:18,617
[SPEAKER_13]: But it wasn't insured on the 15th.

1616
01:54:18,697 --> 01:54:23,199
[SPEAKER_13]: Basically, what you're saying is that we drove around the city with uninsured vehicles, which is just not true.

1617
01:54:23,219 --> 01:54:29,761
[SPEAKER_11]: You had a cardboard plate that said Tennessee on the back of a white car that did not have a Massachusetts registration.

1618
01:54:29,801 --> 01:54:30,742
[SPEAKER_11]: It wasn't inspected.

1619
01:54:30,982 --> 01:54:32,563
[SPEAKER_11]: And it wasn't leaded and identified.

1620
01:54:32,763 --> 01:54:34,443
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what the contract says you were supposed to do.

1621
01:54:34,703 --> 01:54:35,764
[SPEAKER_13]: You had 90 days to do it.

1622
01:54:36,144 --> 01:54:38,065
[SPEAKER_13]: The contract said that we had to mark the vehicles.

1623
01:54:38,903 --> 01:54:46,088
[SPEAKER_11]: Therefore, with that being said, tickets given on those two days, and they're still unalerted vehicles, but I understand what he's doing.

1624
01:54:46,108 --> 01:54:47,369
[SPEAKER_11]: They're just driving the people around.

1625
01:54:47,629 --> 01:54:49,951
[SPEAKER_11]: So the tickets that were given on those two days be waived.

1626
01:54:50,531 --> 01:54:50,971
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all.

1627
01:54:52,350 --> 01:55:15,662
[SPEAKER_13]: To clarify, every single citation that is issued, every single citation, every single citation, no matter when, whether it was January 15th or next January 15th, every single ticket, whether it was this January 15th or next January 15th, is issued by an officer on foot.

1628
01:55:16,082 --> 01:55:18,804
[SPEAKER_13]: The vehicles do not issue citations.

1629
01:55:19,204 --> 01:55:21,165
[SPEAKER_13]: They identify people that are in violation.

1630
01:55:21,498 --> 01:55:23,059
[SPEAKER_13]: The officers get out of the vehicle.

1631
01:55:23,079 --> 01:55:28,361
[SPEAKER_13]: The officers then do a double check through the handheld unit, and every single ticket is issued on foot.

1632
01:55:28,381 --> 01:55:30,943
[SPEAKER_11]: But you had to use that vehicle, Dan, to get to where you were going.

1633
01:55:30,983 --> 01:55:41,608
[SPEAKER_11]: If the chief of police drove down the street and saw my car that was uninspected, unregistered, and didn't have a Massachusetts plate on it for the purposes of an unleaded, he would stop me and give me a ticket.

1634
01:55:43,309 --> 01:55:44,069
[SPEAKER_11]: He didn't have it.

1635
01:55:44,109 --> 01:55:45,370
[SPEAKER_13]: You didn't have those.

1636
01:55:45,730 --> 01:55:49,892
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just clarifying, because you're making it seem that the vehicles themselves issue citations, and they don't.

1637
01:55:50,526 --> 01:55:56,247
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you would have not been able to get the information, Dan, from the orange things on top of those vehicles from the guys driving down the street.

1638
01:55:57,087 --> 01:55:57,407
[SPEAKER_11]: Correct?

1639
01:55:57,647 --> 01:55:59,548
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't need the cameras to get the same information.

1640
01:56:00,008 --> 01:56:14,111
[SPEAKER_18]: So what you're saying is that the technology that your firm employs to affect the parking enforcement plan is not advanced enough that the machines themselves issue citations.

1641
01:56:14,571 --> 01:56:18,472
[SPEAKER_18]: So it still requires the use of a human being in doing that.

1642
01:56:18,752 --> 01:56:18,912
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

1643
01:56:19,872 --> 01:56:19,952
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

1644
01:56:21,194 --> 01:56:21,775
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes and no.

1645
01:56:22,135 --> 01:56:24,457
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1646
01:56:25,198 --> 01:56:25,378
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1647
01:56:25,498 --> 01:56:30,483
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, you can, I mean, in order to issue the citation from the vehicle, you'd have to mail the citation to the house and you can't do that.

1648
01:56:30,503 --> 01:56:34,487
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to put the citation on the windshield and a vehicle can't put a citation on windshield.

1649
01:56:34,807 --> 01:56:37,089
[SPEAKER_13]: We have two means to track every single citation.

1650
01:56:37,510 --> 01:56:45,998
[SPEAKER_13]: First, the camera identifies a potential citation and then the officer, the parking enforcement officer gets out of the vehicle and does a double check through the handheld

1651
01:56:46,315 --> 01:56:46,795
[SPEAKER_13]: to verify it.

1652
01:56:46,835 --> 01:56:50,218
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's two means to do the identification of any violation.

1653
01:56:50,238 --> 01:56:59,144
[SPEAKER_11]: But Dan, he would have never been able to do whatever those violations were on that, at least on the 15th, on the 15th, if he didn't have, if the car was properly, it was like it was supposed to be.

1654
01:56:59,164 --> 01:57:00,325
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of information, Mr. President.

1655
01:57:00,365 --> 01:57:00,845
[SPEAKER_11]: We could have.

1656
01:57:00,865 --> 01:57:02,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of information, Councilor Marks.

1657
01:57:02,967 --> 01:57:11,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Just if I could, I hear what Councilor Pente is stating, but from what we heard, the infractions dealt with parking in handicapped spot, parking in front of a hydrant.

1658
01:57:11,973 --> 01:57:15,115
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, as one member of the council, I don't care how they got the information.

1659
01:57:15,831 --> 01:57:17,532
[SPEAKER_03]: I want them to issue tickets.

1660
01:57:18,232 --> 01:57:29,396
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what they're there for, to issue tickets, and especially for infractions of parking in front of a hydrant, which is a danger, uh, in case of a fire or parking in a handicapped spot, Mr. President.

1661
01:57:29,416 --> 01:57:37,920
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hear what Councilor Prentice is stating, but I don't think we should be waiving any tickets for people that are in violation of parking in those particular spots, Councilor.

1662
01:57:38,120 --> 01:57:39,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Martz.

1663
01:57:40,841 --> 01:57:41,141
[SPEAKER_13]: I will.

1664
01:57:42,826 --> 01:57:46,268
[SPEAKER_13]: avoid any citation on the 15th for overtime parking.

1665
01:57:46,528 --> 01:57:47,249
[SPEAKER_13]: For overtime parking?

1666
01:57:47,329 --> 01:57:53,212
[SPEAKER_13]: I think there was five citations issued that day, and I'll avoid those five citations out of the system for anyone that was overtime.

1667
01:57:53,272 --> 01:57:56,334
[SPEAKER_13]: But the bus stops, and the handicaps, and the crosswalks, we'll keep them.

1668
01:57:57,394 --> 01:58:03,158
[SPEAKER_11]: On that matter, how can you override something without coming to City Hall?

1669
01:58:03,178 --> 01:58:04,118
[SPEAKER_11]: You can do that where you're at?

1670
01:58:05,219 --> 01:58:06,680
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, with your permission, I'll do that.

1671
01:58:06,700 --> 01:58:06,740
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

1672
01:58:06,780 --> 01:58:09,301
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know which way you want me to do it, and you don't want me to do it.

1673
01:58:09,321 --> 01:58:11,322
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope the council agrees to give permission to avoid the tickets, OK?

1674
01:58:15,266 --> 01:58:16,887
[SPEAKER_11]: the council is not authorized to do so.

1675
01:58:17,047 --> 01:58:17,268
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1676
01:58:17,428 --> 01:58:18,008
[SPEAKER_11]: But he can do it.

1677
01:58:18,649 --> 01:58:23,092
[SPEAKER_11]: Second thing on the tickets, is there any way instead of having a paper ticket, you can put a color ticket on that?

1678
01:58:24,374 --> 01:58:26,816
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, yes, that's already been brought up in work.

1679
01:58:26,836 --> 01:58:28,917
[SPEAKER_11]: But I just want to know, cause it's not part of the resolution.

1680
01:58:29,898 --> 01:58:30,098
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1681
01:58:30,178 --> 01:58:32,740
[SPEAKER_11]: I like to make a part of the, there are a couple of solutions to that.

1682
01:58:33,181 --> 01:58:34,562
[SPEAKER_18]: So is that part of the amendment?

1683
01:58:34,582 --> 01:58:34,742
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1684
01:58:34,762 --> 01:58:38,185
[SPEAKER_11]: I like to amend it that the, the, the violations be color coded.

1685
01:58:38,245 --> 01:58:41,528
[SPEAKER_11]: So, and not, and not in paper council and not on paper.

1686
01:58:41,628 --> 01:58:44,350
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, this was already brought up earlier as a,

1687
01:58:45,948 --> 01:58:47,449
[SPEAKER_09]: Resolution as an amendment by myself.

1688
01:58:47,969 --> 01:58:53,871
[SPEAKER_09]: It was I said the ticket talking about it stop and shop in the second question following up people that actually get a violation.

1689
01:58:53,911 --> 01:58:55,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, these are the people we're getting up in mornings.

1690
01:58:55,972 --> 01:58:57,833
[SPEAKER_09]: Will they actually get an envelope to mail it in as well?

1691
01:58:57,993 --> 01:59:01,354
[SPEAKER_09]: Other communities get an envelope priests pre it's pre addressed.

1692
01:59:02,915 --> 01:59:06,877
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, that was not the original plan, but we could look into that.

1693
01:59:07,337 --> 01:59:10,598
[SPEAKER_13]: I think, I think you should because the communities are split.

1694
01:59:10,658 --> 01:59:13,219
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, Hartford, Connecticut, Albany, New York, all these cities, they don't,

1695
01:59:13,583 --> 01:59:14,503
[SPEAKER_13]: They don't issue envelopes.

1696
01:59:14,543 --> 01:59:16,224
[SPEAKER_13]: They just issue your citation on a windshield.

1697
01:59:16,424 --> 01:59:17,425
[SPEAKER_09]: Other communities do.

1698
01:59:17,885 --> 01:59:18,945
[SPEAKER_09]: Where are people going to be mailing them?

1699
01:59:18,965 --> 01:59:20,286
[SPEAKER_09]: To a lockbox out of state somewhere?

1700
01:59:20,326 --> 01:59:21,446
[SPEAKER_09]: Or right to Medford Main Street?

1701
01:59:21,927 --> 01:59:23,007
[SPEAKER_13]: They'd be mailing it to our office.

1702
01:59:23,768 --> 01:59:24,528
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.

1703
01:59:24,548 --> 01:59:25,488
[SPEAKER_13]: Or they could pay them online.

1704
01:59:26,529 --> 01:59:28,270
[SPEAKER_09]: I just, I think it's a lot.

1705
01:59:28,350 --> 01:59:28,710
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they're.

1706
01:59:28,730 --> 01:59:36,373
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, one of the possible solutions to help with the question about the color is to use an envelope that is colored and marked up.

1707
01:59:37,394 --> 01:59:38,014
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's true, too.

1708
01:59:38,074 --> 01:59:39,554
[SPEAKER_09]: Use an orange envelope with a white ticket.

1709
01:59:39,775 --> 01:59:42,856
[SPEAKER_13]: So that could be one potential solution that solves both problems.

1710
01:59:43,719 --> 01:59:48,121
[SPEAKER_11]: Last two points, to get it corrected, because this is the question that was asked.

1711
01:59:48,581 --> 01:59:55,964
[SPEAKER_11]: Once you give a ticket and somebody appeals the ticket, do they have to pay the ticket first or do they have the appeal and after the appeal it's taking place?

1712
01:59:56,765 --> 01:59:57,945
[SPEAKER_11]: No, they do not have to pay the ticket first.

1713
01:59:57,965 --> 01:59:59,246
[SPEAKER_11]: They do not have to pay the ticket in advance.

1714
01:59:59,706 --> 02:00:02,767
[SPEAKER_11]: And the last thing, Chief, did you realize on the ticket they have the word officer?

1715
02:00:03,087 --> 02:00:04,908
[SPEAKER_11]: Why are they using the word officer?

1716
02:00:05,912 --> 02:00:06,993
[SPEAKER_11]: Can that word be changed?

1717
02:00:07,193 --> 02:00:09,154
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I haven't looked at any of the tickets.

1718
02:00:09,194 --> 02:00:09,894
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't seen the tickets.

1719
02:00:09,914 --> 02:00:10,554
[SPEAKER_11]: It says officer on it.

1720
02:00:10,574 --> 02:00:18,199
[SPEAKER_14]: But the fact of the matter is they are referred to as parking control officers, parking enforcement officers, civilian parking control officers.

1721
02:00:18,279 --> 02:00:22,301
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyone see the words officer gives a representation of a police officer, and they're not.

1722
02:00:22,321 --> 02:00:27,764
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not supposed to give anything that represents the city of Medford Fire, Police, or any type of representation.

1723
02:00:27,784 --> 02:00:29,024
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sure that'll be modified.

1724
02:00:29,324 --> 02:00:31,045
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sure that's a simple solution.

1725
02:00:32,086 --> 02:00:34,027
[SPEAKER_14]: But going back on the vehicle issue,

1726
02:00:35,312 --> 02:00:38,634
[SPEAKER_14]: Those vehicles were not unregistered, and they were not uninsured.

1727
02:00:38,994 --> 02:00:41,035
[SPEAKER_14]: Those vehicles were legally on the roadway.

1728
02:00:41,075 --> 02:00:49,059
[SPEAKER_14]: They had temporary Tennessee plates, which is recognized in the state of Massachusetts for that temporary period.

1729
02:00:49,439 --> 02:00:52,461
[SPEAKER_14]: They immediately went to the registry and registered those vehicles.

1730
02:00:53,061 --> 02:00:59,184
[SPEAKER_14]: They have orange lights on order to be installed on the roofs of the vehicles, and they are going to be leaded.

1731
02:01:00,605 --> 02:01:05,027
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that the urge here is to throw the program out,

1732
02:01:05,742 --> 02:01:08,463
[SPEAKER_14]: I think just going at the vehicle is being a bit much.

1733
02:01:08,603 --> 02:01:12,985
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I think the urge is to have, after 90 days, they should have been prepared for this.

1734
02:01:13,565 --> 02:01:14,085
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the urge.

1735
02:01:14,105 --> 02:01:15,846
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, they didn't own the vehicles for 90 days.

1736
02:01:15,886 --> 02:01:16,546
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, they had them for 30 days.

1737
02:01:16,566 --> 02:01:18,367
[SPEAKER_14]: They didn't have an office for 90 days.

1738
02:01:18,647 --> 02:01:20,848
[SPEAKER_11]: Chief, they had 90 days to get them.

1739
02:01:20,888 --> 02:01:23,089
[SPEAKER_11]: They said it in their contract, 90 days, Fred.

1740
02:01:23,109 --> 02:01:24,730
[SPEAKER_11]: 90 days.

1741
02:01:24,990 --> 02:01:27,871
[SPEAKER_11]: I amend the motion that the word officer be replaced on the tickets.

1742
02:01:29,191 --> 02:01:32,693
[SPEAKER_18]: It's amended by Councilor Penta that the word officer be

1743
02:01:34,368 --> 02:01:34,788
[SPEAKER_18]: amended.

1744
02:01:35,228 --> 02:01:36,849
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor, are you through with your amendments?

1745
02:01:36,929 --> 02:01:40,329
[SPEAKER_11]: And also that the ticket, if somebody gets a ticket, it's color coded.

1746
02:01:40,349 --> 02:01:43,110
[SPEAKER_11]: And would you say with the return address envelope?

1747
02:01:43,470 --> 02:01:45,410
[SPEAKER_18]: Colored return address envelope.

1748
02:01:47,450 --> 02:01:53,692
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, if I may, just in wrapping this up, Chief Sackle, I would be remissed.

1749
02:01:54,212 --> 02:02:01,953
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think all of us, while we're not, we're not thoroughly happy the way things are been rolled out,

1750
02:02:02,650 --> 02:02:10,954
[SPEAKER_09]: But there's been one person that is a city employee that has been doing a great job with this, and that's the gentleman at the podium.

1751
02:02:11,694 --> 02:02:14,415
[SPEAKER_09]: I've met him on several occasions over the past two weeks.

1752
02:02:15,636 --> 02:02:19,757
[SPEAKER_09]: He actually got in his vehicle, come out, met this man right here, Mr. President.

1753
02:02:20,297 --> 02:02:28,441
[SPEAKER_09]: And I can appreciate when we say that we want him doing chief of police business, but for taking on the additional responsibility, Chief,

1754
02:02:29,336 --> 02:02:31,198
[SPEAKER_09]: We couldn't have had a better person in this city doing it.

1755
02:02:31,278 --> 02:02:37,604
[SPEAKER_09]: Your personality, your knowledge of the law, and just being responsive to people.

1756
02:02:38,665 --> 02:02:48,654
[SPEAKER_09]: For our police chief, and this came up earlier in the meeting, and I wasn't going to let him go home tonight without bringing this up.

1757
02:02:49,595 --> 02:02:52,278
[SPEAKER_09]: Last week, this man personally went down

1758
02:02:53,157 --> 02:02:54,717
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you pay the meter, though, when you went to every square?

1759
02:02:55,098 --> 02:02:55,498
[SPEAKER_14]: You better.

1760
02:02:55,558 --> 02:02:56,218
[SPEAKER_09]: Every square.

1761
02:02:56,238 --> 02:02:57,598
[SPEAKER_14]: I have the receipts to show, too.

1762
02:02:57,658 --> 02:02:58,718
[SPEAKER_09]: Every square.

1763
02:02:58,919 --> 02:03:06,040
[SPEAKER_09]: The chief went to every single square that have these kiosks, walked around all the businesses, answered questions.

1764
02:03:06,961 --> 02:03:08,001
[SPEAKER_09]: And he didn't need to do that.

1765
02:03:09,101 --> 02:03:09,421
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

1766
02:03:10,402 --> 02:03:12,422
[SPEAKER_18]: And he took the lead on all the hard questions.

1767
02:03:12,582 --> 02:03:13,162
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

1768
02:03:13,302 --> 02:03:13,682
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know what?

1769
02:03:13,702 --> 02:03:15,643
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't finished the square, Medford Square, yet.

1770
02:03:15,663 --> 02:03:16,803
[SPEAKER_14]: So there was some businesses.

1771
02:03:16,863 --> 02:03:17,783
[SPEAKER_09]: There is some businesses.

1772
02:03:17,943 --> 02:03:19,764
[SPEAKER_09]: But like I said, I just.

1773
02:03:20,214 --> 02:03:24,075
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what, he's been the point person, and we couldn't have a better department head doing it.

1774
02:03:24,196 --> 02:03:25,256
[SPEAKER_09]: And thank you, Chief.

1775
02:03:25,316 --> 02:03:26,797
[SPEAKER_09]: And this will all quiet down.

1776
02:03:26,817 --> 02:03:32,939
[SPEAKER_09]: As far as the rollout, and it's way above your pay grade, it could have went a little bit more seamless.

1777
02:03:33,979 --> 02:03:37,201
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there could have been a lot of more information getting out there.

1778
02:03:37,561 --> 02:03:39,862
[SPEAKER_09]: But you're doing an outstanding job.

1779
02:03:39,882 --> 02:03:41,182
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm speaking for all the councilors.

1780
02:03:41,342 --> 02:03:43,583
[SPEAKER_09]: Even Councilor Penter and I, I bet you're in agreement with this 180%.

1781
02:03:43,623 --> 02:03:43,943
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, Councilor?

1782
02:03:43,963 --> 02:03:44,103
[SPEAKER_09]: Hooray.

1783
02:03:47,150 --> 02:03:48,411
[SPEAKER_09]: He said he don't answer.

1784
02:03:48,751 --> 02:03:49,431
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate it.

1785
02:03:49,471 --> 02:03:50,131
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

1786
02:03:50,191 --> 02:03:52,072
[SPEAKER_14]: But you know, this, this does fall.

1787
02:03:52,112 --> 02:03:57,294
[SPEAKER_14]: I know someone said that, you know, this really isn't a chiefly work, but it all falls under the same umbrella.

1788
02:03:57,334 --> 02:04:00,396
[SPEAKER_14]: So the police department's responsible as well.

1789
02:04:00,456 --> 02:04:04,338
[SPEAKER_11]: So let's wrap it up.

1790
02:04:04,378 --> 02:04:05,598
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait a minute.

1791
02:04:05,778 --> 02:04:06,298
[SPEAKER_11]: You want to rush?

1792
02:04:06,518 --> 02:04:06,959
[SPEAKER_11]: Relax.

1793
02:04:08,079 --> 02:04:09,420
[SPEAKER_11]: This is too important of an issue.

1794
02:04:09,480 --> 02:04:09,800
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1795
02:04:10,560 --> 02:04:12,141
[SPEAKER_11]: Number one, after seven o'clock at night,

1796
02:04:13,623 --> 02:04:17,444
[SPEAKER_11]: Dan, you indicated that you're going to have a special team go out after seven o'clock at night.

1797
02:04:17,784 --> 02:04:19,144
[SPEAKER_11]: What does it say that in the contract?

1798
02:04:20,864 --> 02:04:37,467
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, just so that you know, I mean, that was part of the discussion because obviously if we're not giving out stickers for resident parking, we, the police department is going to have a great deal of difficulty identifying those vehicles on those streets that are not resident parking, uh, don't have the permit.

1799
02:04:37,487 --> 02:04:41,248
[SPEAKER_14]: So until such time as we have the technology available to us,

1800
02:04:43,478 --> 02:04:47,560
[SPEAKER_14]: Republic Parking said that they would be glad to stagger hours.

1801
02:04:47,600 --> 02:04:49,940
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe someone will work the early part of the evening.

1802
02:04:49,980 --> 02:04:52,101
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe they'll work from 10 p.m.

1803
02:04:52,141 --> 02:04:52,681
[SPEAKER_14]: to 2 a.m.

1804
02:04:53,522 --> 02:04:58,264
[SPEAKER_14]: The goal is so that people don't have to call with the complaints that we try to get the compliance.

1805
02:05:00,284 --> 02:05:02,425
[SPEAKER_14]: They can do whatever they want with their personnel.

1806
02:05:02,585 --> 02:05:04,106
[SPEAKER_14]: It's outside of us.

1807
02:05:04,126 --> 02:05:08,948
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think there's anything locked in the contract about when they're gonna work or how many.

1808
02:05:09,488 --> 02:05:12,329
[SPEAKER_14]: Whatever it takes to accomplish the goal, they're willing to work with us.

1809
02:05:12,942 --> 02:05:15,303
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to be short staffed technology wise.

1810
02:05:15,343 --> 02:05:15,963
[SPEAKER_14]: We're lacking.

1811
02:05:16,723 --> 02:05:17,323
[SPEAKER_14]: They have it.

1812
02:05:17,923 --> 02:05:20,504
[SPEAKER_14]: They're registering everyone for those permanent parking streets.

1813
02:05:21,444 --> 02:05:22,325
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a natural fit.

1814
02:05:22,885 --> 02:05:24,785
[SPEAKER_14]: I wouldn't argue with the fact that I understand.

1815
02:05:24,885 --> 02:05:28,927
[SPEAKER_11]: I understand the seven to seven, but I don't understand how they can work after seven.

1816
02:05:29,027 --> 02:05:30,467
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, and as far as their,

1817
02:05:31,177 --> 02:05:33,479
[SPEAKER_11]: financial windfall that comes out of all of that, number one.

1818
02:05:33,499 --> 02:05:34,960
[SPEAKER_11]: And number two, how are you going to read in the dock?

1819
02:05:35,200 --> 02:05:36,541
[SPEAKER_11]: How are they going to read number plates in the dock?

1820
02:05:36,561 --> 02:05:39,583
[SPEAKER_14]: The license plate readers pick them up no matter what time of day it is.

1821
02:05:39,923 --> 02:05:41,765
[SPEAKER_14]: Dock, basically infrared.

1822
02:05:41,785 --> 02:05:45,247
[SPEAKER_11]: But when cars are parked close together, Chief, what are they going to get out of the car?

1823
02:05:46,968 --> 02:05:49,030
[SPEAKER_14]: The license plate reader reads those plates.

1824
02:05:49,070 --> 02:05:50,131
[SPEAKER_14]: They can read them from angles.

1825
02:05:50,471 --> 02:05:54,354
[SPEAKER_14]: I've seen how those things work, and you'd be amazed.

1826
02:05:54,374 --> 02:06:00,578
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, unless the bumpers are back to back, and you couldn't even see the plate, even if you got out and looked on your own.

1827
02:06:01,421 --> 02:06:03,723
[SPEAKER_14]: That may be the only reason why there'd be a difficulty there.

1828
02:06:03,863 --> 02:06:06,805
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it was mentioned at the Committee of the Whole meeting that it cost about $30,000.

1829
02:06:06,885 --> 02:06:10,107
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that what it is for those things to be on top of those cars?

1830
02:06:10,167 --> 02:06:10,868
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that what it is, Dan?

1831
02:06:11,108 --> 02:06:18,173
[SPEAKER_14]: Theirs may be more expensive, but what we had, the unit that we presently have was $30,000 when we bought it.

1832
02:06:19,394 --> 02:06:21,395
[SPEAKER_13]: Retail cost on a unit is $60,000.

1833
02:06:22,436 --> 02:06:22,816
[SPEAKER_13]: $60,000 retail.

1834
02:06:22,836 --> 02:06:25,318
[SPEAKER_13]: With our discount.

1835
02:06:25,338 --> 02:06:26,398
[SPEAKER_13]: And is that installed?

1836
02:06:27,379 --> 02:06:29,040
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, and that's just the unit.

1837
02:06:29,080 --> 02:06:29,861
[SPEAKER_13]: That's not the vehicle.

1838
02:06:30,305 --> 02:06:40,728
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, since we have approximately $7 million in free cash, I'm going to move that the city's police department be afforded an opportunity to investigate what the cost would be to install them in your cruises.

1839
02:06:42,268 --> 02:06:51,251
[SPEAKER_14]: Just so you know, one of the earlier meetings, that was one of the things that the mayor and Mrs. Burke had brought up to make sure that we- Well, I'm glad you know that because we have to read it in the newspaper to find out what's going on.

1840
02:06:51,271 --> 02:06:57,653
[SPEAKER_14]: But no, I mean, it was brought up at a meeting and it was discussed and actually Louise Miller was asked to research it.

1841
02:06:59,150 --> 02:07:01,732
[SPEAKER_14]: It'll be coming, but it does take time for those things to happen.

1842
02:07:01,752 --> 02:07:06,195
[SPEAKER_14]: So in the interim, Republic's going to help us out and hopefully we satisfy the needs.

1843
02:07:06,255 --> 02:07:08,717
[SPEAKER_11]: In the effort to eliminate redundancy, why don't we withdraw that amendment?

1844
02:07:08,777 --> 02:07:09,958
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm going to put it on there as an amendment.

1845
02:07:11,479 --> 02:07:17,463
[SPEAKER_14]: But, you know, I just want to say that, you know, and I appreciate the comments, but the fact of the matter is we're all in this together.

1846
02:07:17,703 --> 02:07:20,805
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, we all love the city that we live in and we work in.

1847
02:07:22,346 --> 02:07:24,528
[SPEAKER_14]: This is going to take, this'll take a while.

1848
02:07:24,588 --> 02:07:27,890
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, this is probably going to take a little while to iron out, but I think

1849
02:07:28,648 --> 02:07:35,291
[SPEAKER_14]: Based on some of the comments I heard, and I don't think they were just saying it because I was there, they realized it was coming at some point.

1850
02:07:35,951 --> 02:07:37,472
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just a shock to the system.

1851
02:07:37,652 --> 02:07:39,372
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a tough time of year, January.

1852
02:07:39,712 --> 02:07:41,253
[SPEAKER_14]: All the bills are coming in from Christmas.

1853
02:07:42,294 --> 02:07:50,877
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just, business is off anyway in January, and this isn't helping things, but it will improve, and most people have been pretty positive about it.

1854
02:07:51,917 --> 02:07:52,798
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, my chief.

1855
02:07:53,338 --> 02:07:56,839
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Panter, are you satisfied with your amendments?

1856
02:07:57,420 --> 02:07:57,600
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1857
02:07:58,000 --> 02:07:58,320
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1858
02:07:59,920 --> 02:08:02,261
[SPEAKER_18]: Ma'am, would you please state your name and address for the record?

1859
02:08:02,581 --> 02:08:04,481
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, Jean Martin, 10 Cumming Street.

1860
02:08:04,681 --> 02:08:11,583
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to say two nice things about this program, and then that'll set me off from going off.

1861
02:08:13,524 --> 02:08:29,348
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, one of the good things about this program is that it saves our police from becoming, in other words, for other better words, meter maids, which is a waste of their time, which satisfies one of my requirements

1862
02:08:29,988 --> 02:08:30,848
[SPEAKER_01]: parking enforcement.

1863
02:08:31,128 --> 02:08:32,148
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one good thing.

1864
02:08:33,409 --> 02:08:34,369
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad to see that.

1865
02:08:35,409 --> 02:08:41,270
[SPEAKER_01]: And the second thing is it got the commuters from other cities from stopping and parking in the city.

1866
02:08:42,130 --> 02:08:44,050
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are my two compliments to this program.

1867
02:08:44,731 --> 02:08:51,092
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything else is a complete, if we didn't have a 10-year contract with these folks, we would scrap this whole thing and start fresh.

1868
02:08:51,552 --> 02:08:54,772
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the amount of changes and everything else.

1869
02:08:55,292 --> 02:08:58,833
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have to say, with all due respect to the police chief,

1870
02:08:59,300 --> 02:09:12,328
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not his job to set policy, which he is manipulating and working with, not manipulating, that's a bad word, but he is working and tweaking policy that the mayor should be here on.

1871
02:09:12,548 --> 02:09:14,049
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's getting my blood pressure up.

1872
02:09:14,449 --> 02:09:18,211
[SPEAKER_01]: The mayor should be here taking his own heat for his own program.

1873
02:09:18,511 --> 02:09:24,014
[SPEAKER_01]: He's making the chief of police take the heat, waste the chief's time when he should be doing other things in this city.

1874
02:09:24,535 --> 02:09:26,616
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what got my blood up today.

1875
02:09:28,798 --> 02:09:29,939
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I have a whole bunch of things.

1876
02:09:29,959 --> 02:09:34,701
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other thing is about Mr. Marks, he was on that committee or commission or whatever it was for the parking enforcement.

1877
02:09:35,101 --> 02:09:38,342
[SPEAKER_01]: Total insult to all the time that they spent on that committee.

1878
02:09:38,742 --> 02:09:43,584
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that the police chief is paid to be on it because he's paid as a city employee.

1879
02:09:43,844 --> 02:09:48,406
[SPEAKER_01]: But there were citizens that were on that committee that spent time on that parking enforcement program.

1880
02:09:48,787 --> 02:09:54,109
[SPEAKER_01]: Had that been recognized by the police chief, I mean by the mayor, we wouldn't be in this position.

1881
02:09:54,509 --> 02:09:56,690
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't have anything against the outside vendor.

1882
02:09:57,080 --> 02:09:59,941
[SPEAKER_01]: But because we're in this contract now, we're signed into it.

1883
02:10:00,442 --> 02:10:09,927
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just, all of these issues need to be brought up next week when the mayor is in town and sitting here, taking the heat for his own program.

1884
02:10:10,527 --> 02:10:14,229
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's his and it's yours, you know, for whatever.

1885
02:10:14,968 --> 02:10:18,112
[SPEAKER_01]: You can argue about how much responsibility is the council's.

1886
02:10:18,652 --> 02:10:23,338
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is also, it is primarily the signature is by the mayor.

1887
02:10:23,498 --> 02:10:27,823
[SPEAKER_01]: He has the only authority to tweak it, change it, put a stop sign here.

1888
02:10:28,344 --> 02:10:31,708
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the ultimate authority for where there's going to be a parking meter or whatever.

1889
02:10:32,108 --> 02:10:41,403
[SPEAKER_01]: And the kiosks, don't even get me started on the kiosks, because that has caused more problems than if you had just put meters in, quarter-fed meters.

1890
02:10:42,344 --> 02:10:46,691
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, whether you agree with it or not, and put in too well parking, and then have people watch it.

1891
02:10:47,374 --> 02:10:50,976
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody understands a meter, a simple, simple, simple meter.

1892
02:10:51,096 --> 02:10:52,137
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody understands it.

1893
02:10:52,777 --> 02:10:54,638
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just have to say that.

1894
02:10:54,718 --> 02:11:00,362
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, I think we should have went by the recommendations of the parking commission.

1895
02:11:00,862 --> 02:11:02,143
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it should have been reconsidered.

1896
02:11:02,463 --> 02:11:05,965
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, the two things I'm going to, so that my blood pressure comes down.

1897
02:11:07,103 --> 02:11:15,249
[SPEAKER_01]: One, the police are not wasting their time, although the police chief is now wasting his time on this, when it should be the mayor that's taking the heat for his own program.

1898
02:11:15,950 --> 02:11:18,772
[SPEAKER_01]: He is the enforcement of policy.

1899
02:11:19,312 --> 02:11:22,314
[SPEAKER_01]: He is not the signature on the policy.

1900
02:11:22,655 --> 02:11:24,376
[SPEAKER_01]: He is not the guy that makes the policy.

1901
02:11:24,416 --> 02:11:25,757
[SPEAKER_01]: The mayor is the guy that makes the policy.

1902
02:11:26,177 --> 02:11:33,062
[SPEAKER_01]: And number two, it got the commuter traffic off of the streets, which was the second good thing about this policy.

1903
02:11:33,543 --> 02:11:35,825
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, I'll shut up.

1904
02:11:35,885 --> 02:11:36,165
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1905
02:11:38,037 --> 02:11:38,757
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Jean.

1906
02:11:39,077 --> 02:11:39,818
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion.

1907
02:11:43,780 --> 02:11:45,340
[SPEAKER_18]: Do we have any motions for separation?

1908
02:11:45,600 --> 02:11:45,941
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, ma'am.

1909
02:11:46,861 --> 02:11:47,541
[SPEAKER_18]: My apologies.

1910
02:11:48,302 --> 02:11:49,342
[SPEAKER_18]: Your name and address for the record.

1911
02:11:49,362 --> 02:11:51,763
[SPEAKER_12]: Mary Ann Ashcraft, 77 Fountain Street.

1912
02:11:52,103 --> 02:11:53,044
[SPEAKER_12]: I was here last week.

1913
02:11:54,684 --> 02:11:59,667
[SPEAKER_12]: I actually got a call from a businessman in Medford Square.

1914
02:12:00,847 --> 02:12:01,488
[SPEAKER_12]: What's happening?

1915
02:12:02,548 --> 02:12:05,009
[SPEAKER_12]: Are we in the business of putting people out of business?

1916
02:12:05,729 --> 02:12:06,450
[SPEAKER_12]: I understand

1917
02:12:07,372 --> 02:12:08,372
[SPEAKER_12]: We've got the kiosks.

1918
02:12:08,432 --> 02:12:09,673
[SPEAKER_12]: We may have to live with them.

1919
02:12:09,893 --> 02:12:11,314
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd like to see them opt out of them.

1920
02:12:12,314 --> 02:12:14,755
[SPEAKER_12]: What happens when the bridge starts construction?

1921
02:12:16,035 --> 02:12:17,816
[SPEAKER_12]: We have people going out of business now.

1922
02:12:17,836 --> 02:12:18,836
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to have more people.

1923
02:12:20,717 --> 02:12:21,237
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly.

1924
02:12:22,298 --> 02:12:27,060
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, I've been here my whole life, like I said.

1925
02:12:27,100 --> 02:12:27,820
[SPEAKER_12]: I know people.

1926
02:12:27,840 --> 02:12:30,581
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't expect to hear from people that own businesses.

1927
02:12:31,822 --> 02:12:33,562
[SPEAKER_12]: They call me and say, what's going on?

1928
02:12:33,622 --> 02:12:35,323
[SPEAKER_12]: And I said, call the mayor.

1929
02:12:36,268 --> 02:12:37,689
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't blame the city council.

1930
02:12:38,950 --> 02:12:40,491
[SPEAKER_12]: I myself haven't been in the square.

1931
02:12:41,211 --> 02:12:42,572
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't intend to be in the square.

1932
02:12:43,673 --> 02:12:45,934
[SPEAKER_12]: I've changed my prescriptions from CBS.

1933
02:12:46,215 --> 02:12:47,215
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going somewhere else.

1934
02:12:48,996 --> 02:12:50,557
[SPEAKER_12]: I see people going out of business.

1935
02:12:51,898 --> 02:12:53,039
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think it's going to work.

1936
02:12:53,479 --> 02:12:54,740
[SPEAKER_12]: Can the mayor opt out of this?

1937
02:12:55,521 --> 02:12:56,361
[SPEAKER_12]: We have three months.

1938
02:12:58,002 --> 02:12:59,583
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a year to opt out of it.

1939
02:13:00,304 --> 02:13:05,367
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, as I have said to some council members, Norton,

1940
02:13:06,370 --> 02:13:16,794
[SPEAKER_12]: this surrounding, the mayor had plans drawn up by an architectural firm in Cambridge that cost a lot of money, because I know the architect that drew up the plans.

1941
02:13:17,575 --> 02:13:18,035
[SPEAKER_12]: What happened?

1942
02:13:18,055 --> 02:13:18,995
[SPEAKER_12]: He said, we can't afford it.

1943
02:13:20,036 --> 02:13:20,996
[SPEAKER_12]: But we can afford this.

1944
02:13:23,277 --> 02:13:24,377
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't understand it.

1945
02:13:25,638 --> 02:13:26,578
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not happy with it.

1946
02:13:27,559 --> 02:13:30,880
[SPEAKER_12]: Probably what I say doesn't mean it will make any difference.

1947
02:13:31,440 --> 02:13:33,161
[SPEAKER_12]: But I do have a friend that's a dentist.

1948
02:13:33,701 --> 02:13:36,142
[SPEAKER_12]: They're taking her bridge, her parking lot,

1949
02:13:37,617 --> 02:13:46,004
[SPEAKER_12]: To reconstruct the Craddock Bridge, patients complain now, because I've worked with Dr. Zietzer, and I've worked in the office for many years.

1950
02:13:46,064 --> 02:13:50,107
[SPEAKER_12]: Dr. Zietzer opened that practice in 1971, I believe.

1951
02:13:51,968 --> 02:13:54,470
[SPEAKER_12]: They have no parking now to come to their dental appointments.

1952
02:13:55,331 --> 02:14:05,499
[SPEAKER_12]: And certainly, when there's major construction, she's not going to be seeing those patients that come from quite a distance, that have been coming from that distance for 30, 40 years.

1953
02:14:09,253 --> 02:14:10,434
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't say any more about it.

1954
02:14:11,694 --> 02:14:13,755
[SPEAKER_12]: It's terrible, I think.

1955
02:14:14,215 --> 02:14:14,616
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1956
02:14:16,597 --> 02:14:17,177
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mayor.

1957
02:14:18,658 --> 02:14:25,561
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion, do we have motions to sever, motions to withdraw amendments?

1958
02:14:30,944 --> 02:14:31,344
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1959
02:14:32,044 --> 02:14:37,247
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion to sever all of the amendments from the main motion.

1960
02:14:38,778 --> 02:14:46,827
[SPEAKER_18]: just the one motion to sever the one for or against the project.

1961
02:14:46,847 --> 02:14:49,770
[SPEAKER_13]: He's withdrawing it for a week.

1962
02:15:03,435 --> 02:15:04,216
[SPEAKER_18]: Put it on the agenda.

1963
02:15:04,236 --> 02:15:04,936
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you have that?

1964
02:15:05,836 --> 02:15:07,037
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you have another copy of that?

1965
02:15:07,317 --> 02:15:08,557
[SPEAKER_18]: You have the one that you numbered.

1966
02:15:15,060 --> 02:15:18,661
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, that's the... The clerk will assign it a number.

1967
02:15:18,861 --> 02:15:19,982
[SPEAKER_19]: That number's gone already.

1968
02:15:27,384 --> 02:15:29,405
[SPEAKER_18]: Refile it as a resolution.

1969
02:15:29,485 --> 02:15:30,506
[SPEAKER_18]: So that is withdrawn.

1970
02:15:31,026 --> 02:15:31,886
[SPEAKER_18]: All those in favor.

1971
02:15:32,146 --> 02:15:32,887
[SPEAKER_18]: All those opposed.

1972
02:15:33,747 --> 02:15:41,471
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, so we have before us withdrawn the motion to withdraw, uh, whichever it's withdrawn.

1973
02:15:42,011 --> 02:15:50,995
[SPEAKER_18]: So we have the main motion to continue this discussion as amended by Councilors, Camuso, Marks, Penta,

1974
02:15:51,428 --> 02:15:52,409
[SPEAKER_18]: and Lungo-Koehn.

1975
02:15:52,829 --> 02:15:53,709
[SPEAKER_18]: All those in favour?

1976
02:15:54,590 --> 02:15:55,410
[SPEAKER_18]: All those opposed?

1977
02:15:55,450 --> 02:15:56,571
[SPEAKER_18]: The motion carries.

1978
02:15:57,731 --> 02:16:08,537
[SPEAKER_18]: Petitions, presentations and similar matters, 1520, position by Eugene Martin, 10 Cummings Street, Medford, to discuss Haines Square redevelopment.

1979
02:16:09,018 --> 02:16:09,238
[SPEAKER_18]: Ms.

1980
02:16:09,298 --> 02:16:09,618
[SPEAKER_18]: Martin,

1981
02:16:10,302 --> 02:16:10,822
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1982
02:16:10,962 --> 02:16:12,202
[SPEAKER_01]: Jean Martin, 10 Cummings Street.

1983
02:16:12,282 --> 02:16:14,623
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for letting me speak here tonight.

1984
02:16:15,423 --> 02:16:25,785
[SPEAKER_01]: Haines Square is a great square, and it has great potential to thrive, and yet left neglected, and without proper advocacy from the city as a whole.

1985
02:16:27,186 --> 02:16:38,148
[SPEAKER_01]: If you would just take a good look at the architecture, you would see what I see, the base for a wonderful meeting place for the citizens of Medford to commune, as well as purchase goods and services.

1986
02:16:39,248 --> 02:16:49,457
[SPEAKER_01]: To revitalize the square, we need to have joint meetings between the state officials because of Route 60, Route 28, and the MBTA bus barns.

1987
02:16:50,077 --> 02:17:00,226
[SPEAKER_01]: Local politicians, especially the mayor and small business community, all need to get together to have a good, wholesome plan for the whole unit.

1988
02:17:00,486 --> 02:17:04,590
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be taken as a whole area and not just piecemeal.

1989
02:17:05,537 --> 02:17:13,842
[SPEAKER_01]: The best assets the square has are Dempsey's restaurant, without a doubt, the best combination of community with its breakfast menu.

1990
02:17:14,363 --> 02:17:18,725
[SPEAKER_01]: I watch people all have coffee, commune, talk, families, friends.

1991
02:17:19,526 --> 02:17:23,108
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a social place as well as a place to receive, you know, it's a food place.

1992
02:17:23,568 --> 02:17:28,091
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's absolutely the cornerstone in its proximity to the square, how it's central.

1993
02:17:28,131 --> 02:17:34,135
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the central eye catches of the square and it's absolutely one of the anchors of the square.

1994
02:17:35,769 --> 02:17:39,472
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, the sidewalk outside of it has potential.

1995
02:17:39,772 --> 02:17:44,436
[SPEAKER_01]: It has those seatings with the picnic tables or whatever, but they're not used.

1996
02:17:45,437 --> 02:17:48,339
[SPEAKER_01]: As it is, the man that owns it says he has to come out.

1997
02:17:48,379 --> 02:17:51,942
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a city property, the sidewalk city property.

1998
02:17:51,982 --> 02:17:56,825
[SPEAKER_01]: He's not supposed to be responsible to shovel the snow, but he often does.

1999
02:17:57,265 --> 02:18:03,010
[SPEAKER_01]: He takes care of that, and so do the other two businesses, the florist and the pizza parlor, because nobody else will.

2000
02:18:04,103 --> 02:18:06,765
[SPEAKER_01]: because the city doesn't have the services that it used to provide.

2001
02:18:07,425 --> 02:18:16,850
[SPEAKER_01]: But that space, that little triangle where Dempsey's is, is absolutely perfect to have umbrellas with people out there eating and communing from, especially Dempsey's.

2002
02:18:18,031 --> 02:18:24,715
[SPEAKER_01]: Or eating a sandwich from a local sub shop down Alfredo's Kitchen or something, get a sub, come down.

2003
02:18:25,195 --> 02:18:26,856
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on the same side of the block.

2004
02:18:27,176 --> 02:18:28,377
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to go out of your own way.

2005
02:18:29,658 --> 02:18:36,504
[SPEAKER_01]: Modern hardware is another huge staple, which has offered many people the convenience and personal touch for home improvement.

2006
02:18:37,004 --> 02:18:42,769
[SPEAKER_01]: The laundromats are a staple for the area because of the large rental apartments all throughout the neighborhood.

2007
02:18:43,769 --> 02:18:50,495
[SPEAKER_01]: What needs to be said is that Haines Square has a lot of two-family houses that are now used as rental properties.

2008
02:18:50,575 --> 02:18:52,877
[SPEAKER_01]: Both up and down are used as rental properties.

2009
02:18:52,937 --> 02:18:55,339
[SPEAKER_01]: People live outside of the city, own those houses.

2010
02:18:55,979 --> 02:19:03,310
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not no longer just owner occupied like it used to be back in the day and so you have a high population of people that use the buses and use

2011
02:19:03,793 --> 02:19:05,794
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, different mechanisms.

2012
02:19:05,954 --> 02:19:09,375
[SPEAKER_01]: And they also use the dry cleaners and the laundromat.

2013
02:19:09,695 --> 02:19:27,540
[SPEAKER_01]: The laundromat there is absolutely essential because a lot of people that live in those rental properties, a lot of owners don't let them use the basement for washer and dryers or sometimes have coin-operated machines in their basement or something, but a lot of renters use the laundromat in Haines Square.

2014
02:19:27,600 --> 02:19:29,201
[SPEAKER_01]: They can walk right down there and use it.

2015
02:19:29,541 --> 02:19:31,121
[SPEAKER_01]: So those laundromats need to stay there.

2016
02:19:33,848 --> 02:19:36,690
[SPEAKER_01]: The downside of the square is its central focus.

2017
02:19:37,210 --> 02:19:42,774
[SPEAKER_01]: As you drive up from Medford Square, which has a liquor store, which used to be the movie theater.

2018
02:19:42,814 --> 02:19:45,316
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I realize that a liquor store is a legal business.

2019
02:19:45,556 --> 02:19:46,577
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a legitimate business.

2020
02:19:46,597 --> 02:19:52,261
[SPEAKER_01]: It brings in a lot of tax revenue, because the taxes on liquor are higher than other goods and services.

2021
02:19:52,321 --> 02:19:53,021
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand that.

2022
02:19:53,702 --> 02:20:02,948
[SPEAKER_01]: However, as you're coming up that square, where Spring Street comes into Route 60, the thing that catches your eye, which used to be a movie theater, is now a liquor store.

2023
02:20:03,402 --> 02:20:06,224
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not against that personal person that owns it.

2024
02:20:06,744 --> 02:20:18,031
[SPEAKER_01]: But if anybody could arrange to have that liquor store move to a place along the side of a bunch of blocker stores and not be the central focus, that would make the whole thing different.

2025
02:20:18,072 --> 02:20:26,597
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, if you had an eatery inside that theater, if you had an eatery with Wi-Fi, that would be awesome.

2026
02:20:26,817 --> 02:20:31,100
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole feel of that liquor store area would change.

2027
02:20:31,420 --> 02:20:38,803
[SPEAKER_01]: If you had nice glass windows that were open and not filled with signs for Bud Light or whatever, then, wait a minute, I'm not done yet.

2028
02:20:39,503 --> 02:20:41,084
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, oh, okay, all right.

2029
02:20:41,604 --> 02:20:44,245
[SPEAKER_01]: So, because if you look at it, you see Bud Light and whatever.

2030
02:20:44,725 --> 02:20:59,951
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead, if you saw people sitting in chairs, you know, using their devices, and I will agree now, I've come to change my mind, I'll even let you put a bike rack in front of that area so that if people are traveling by bicycle, they can go and hang there and have lunch, okay?

2031
02:21:02,312 --> 02:21:06,215
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, if you change that, you would change the whole feel of that whole region.

2032
02:21:07,576 --> 02:21:12,199
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not against the liquor store, if you want to put it to the side in another spot, more power to you.

2033
02:21:12,479 --> 02:21:20,625
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a central focal point, and if you put an eatery in there, man, a lunch place, sandwich, soup, something like that, where people have, you know,

2034
02:21:21,245 --> 02:21:23,886
[SPEAKER_01]: a lunch thing, because you've got the breakfast thing right over there at Dempsey's.

2035
02:21:25,426 --> 02:21:26,787
[SPEAKER_01]: It would really be awesome.

2036
02:21:28,927 --> 02:21:29,288
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

2037
02:21:29,788 --> 02:21:34,569
[SPEAKER_01]: The other big problem is the MBTA bus barns and the brick building that sits in front of it.

2038
02:21:34,909 --> 02:21:37,330
[SPEAKER_01]: The brick building was built in, like, 1922.

2039
02:21:38,431 --> 02:21:45,793
[SPEAKER_01]: I realize that there is an electrical infrastructure for the bus barns, and it is a problem, but guess what?

2040
02:21:46,559 --> 02:21:47,720
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the MBTA's problem.

2041
02:21:47,760 --> 02:21:48,500
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not my problem.

2042
02:21:48,540 --> 02:21:49,661
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not Haines Square's problem.

2043
02:21:49,701 --> 02:21:50,681
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the city's problem.

2044
02:21:51,101 --> 02:21:54,263
[SPEAKER_01]: The MBTA buses sit there, and they look horrible.

2045
02:21:55,543 --> 02:21:59,205
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine if that bus barn area was a green space.

2046
02:21:59,385 --> 02:21:59,826
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.

2047
02:22:00,306 --> 02:22:01,446
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I'm transforming.

2048
02:22:01,486 --> 02:22:03,567
[SPEAKER_01]: The city's going in my head or something.

2049
02:22:03,587 --> 02:22:04,588
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking green.

2050
02:22:05,088 --> 02:22:09,170
[SPEAKER_01]: But if that place, if that area was green, I've been around you people too long.

2051
02:22:09,530 --> 02:22:14,333
[SPEAKER_01]: So if that area was green with some benches to sit,

2052
02:22:15,365 --> 02:22:23,306
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, you buy a sandwich, you go and you sit on a bench with some green space instead of the bus barns, it would be another place that would be open for the community to come and sit.

2053
02:22:23,386 --> 02:22:24,787
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want other buildings put there.

2054
02:22:24,867 --> 02:22:27,487
[SPEAKER_01]: God knows we've got enough buildings in this city.

2055
02:22:27,547 --> 02:22:29,647
[SPEAKER_01]: We keep putting up developments every which way.

2056
02:22:30,047 --> 02:22:31,908
[SPEAKER_01]: You get a postage stamp, they put up a building.

2057
02:22:32,368 --> 02:22:45,070
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you could take that and turn it into green space, but that's going to take the effort of the state representatives, the state senators, you people, the mayor, the small business community, the Chamber of Commerce, everybody's going to have to get in on that.

2058
02:22:45,390 --> 02:22:46,971
[SPEAKER_01]: But visualize it.

2059
02:22:47,151 --> 02:22:49,312
[SPEAKER_01]: Have some imagination.

2060
02:22:51,413 --> 02:22:51,833
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

2061
02:22:52,913 --> 02:22:57,095
[SPEAKER_01]: With the help of the state delegation, blah, blah, blah, I would like to see the green space, blah, blah, blah.

2062
02:22:57,315 --> 02:23:04,758
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the MBTA is another problem, because we have buses and trucks that often go through there.

2063
02:23:05,099 --> 02:23:11,141
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're going to introduce, God forbid, bike lanes, because I personally think it's an accident waiting to happen.

2064
02:23:11,161 --> 02:23:14,903
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you are, you're going to have to decide, are we going to take out parking spaces?

2065
02:23:15,437 --> 02:23:16,938
[SPEAKER_01]: in order to put a bus lane?

2066
02:23:17,699 --> 02:23:18,099
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

2067
02:23:18,879 --> 02:23:27,205
[SPEAKER_01]: But whatever you do, you're going to have to involve the MBTA, because trucks, huge trucks, go down there to deliver, especially for modern hardware.

2068
02:23:27,225 --> 02:23:30,627
[SPEAKER_01]: I see trucks all day dropping off stuff for modern hardware.

2069
02:23:31,247 --> 02:23:32,408
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not semi.

2070
02:23:32,768 --> 02:23:33,669
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just small.

2071
02:23:34,229 --> 02:23:35,010
[SPEAKER_01]: But they are trucks.

2072
02:23:35,070 --> 02:23:38,792
[SPEAKER_01]: They're commercial trucks traversing and buses that traverse all the time.

2073
02:23:39,153 --> 02:23:42,355
[SPEAKER_01]: So the MBTA is going to have to be involved if we move a bus stop.

2074
02:23:42,895 --> 02:23:43,255
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

2075
02:23:43,736 --> 02:23:44,196
[SPEAKER_01]: Design it.

2076
02:23:45,022 --> 02:23:52,348
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't get paid to do this, but there are people that get paid to design these kind of squares, and if we had some imagination, we could transform that square.

2077
02:23:54,670 --> 02:23:55,250
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

2078
02:23:56,632 --> 02:23:56,972
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.

2079
02:23:57,132 --> 02:23:57,632
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

2080
02:23:58,213 --> 02:23:58,553
[SPEAKER_01]: What else?

2081
02:24:00,235 --> 02:24:00,955
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

2082
02:24:01,015 --> 02:24:01,456
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

2083
02:24:02,256 --> 02:24:08,842
[SPEAKER_01]: As for general cleanliness, we used to have section men, or we could use women today,

2084
02:24:09,696 --> 02:24:14,479
[SPEAKER_01]: in the squares, whose sole job was to pick up the litter in the square.

2085
02:24:14,919 --> 02:24:27,947
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I understand that it costs a lot of money, but whether the DPW hires more personnel to become square people, that sounds funny, but square cleaners, I don't know how to say it, but sweepers,

2086
02:24:30,288 --> 02:24:49,160
[SPEAKER_01]: part time, part of their sessions, or maybe Monday, Wednesday, Friday, or whatever, or hire senior citizens, I don't care how it gets done, but we need to have people to clean up the litter because there's a lot of litter blown around, and I don't have to tell you people, the lines for the parking spaces are not, they're not there.

2087
02:24:50,320 --> 02:24:56,224
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a weird, the way the square is too, if somebody, you're kind of like when you come in from,

2088
02:24:58,190 --> 02:25:03,972
[SPEAKER_01]: Spring Street to Salem, it's kind of, I don't know, it's kind of, people do their own thing.

2089
02:25:04,532 --> 02:25:10,934
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it could be one lane, but there's two or three cars stacked, like lined up, you know.

2090
02:25:11,434 --> 02:25:18,016
[SPEAKER_01]: So, whatever, the traffic people that organized could straighten that out and maybe make the island in the middle bigger

2091
02:25:18,636 --> 02:25:37,188
[SPEAKER_01]: make it so that there's only room for one car to go one way so that you don't see piles up or maybe the island could also become bigger for another use like when we have our festivals in the fall the fall festival they use that as the stage prop area for the festival for where the stage is so if you expand that little bit

2092
02:25:37,710 --> 02:25:41,271
[SPEAKER_01]: You could have the thing, you know, use it for some other space.

2093
02:25:41,451 --> 02:25:43,912
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, OK.

2094
02:25:44,693 --> 02:26:01,899
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't care how you get it done, but we need to have section people to clean up and to paint and to do all of that stuff, to monitor flower pots, water them, whatever, you know, those barrels with the flowers in them, make it nice with the lights, with the hanging pots and all of that.

2095
02:26:03,340 --> 02:26:03,920
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a dream.

2096
02:26:04,320 --> 02:26:04,600
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

2097
02:26:06,518 --> 02:26:09,339
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, the signage all looks trashy.

2098
02:26:10,540 --> 02:26:18,203
[SPEAKER_01]: There's too many things in the windows in the stores, and if you had the awnings or all of the signage uniform, it doesn't have to be exactly the same.

2099
02:26:18,463 --> 02:26:26,146
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have your own personality, but if there's some kind of consistency throughout the signage, that would improve the area.

2100
02:26:26,886 --> 02:26:28,087
[SPEAKER_01]: As for parking enforcement,

2101
02:26:29,415 --> 02:26:33,177
[SPEAKER_01]: The mayor assigned a committee to review the problem back in 2009.

2102
02:26:34,057 --> 02:26:37,599
[SPEAKER_01]: He had ignored the recommendations of that committee and it has led to chaos.

2103
02:26:37,699 --> 02:26:40,220
[SPEAKER_01]: We've talked about that, but I'm going to go over it real quick because I wrote it down.

2104
02:26:40,821 --> 02:26:49,345
[SPEAKER_01]: The decision has been made by the mayor to go with an outside private contractor and has been signed for seven years with three more added options.

2105
02:26:50,236 --> 02:26:57,022
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of the businesses in Haines Square are not in the Chamber of Commerce, and therefore have not had a voice in the matter.

2106
02:26:57,723 --> 02:27:07,050
[SPEAKER_01]: Not until now, and I understand the Chief has talked to some of those business owners, that's wonderful, but I know for a fact that a lot of those business owners don't belong to the Chamber of Commerce.

2107
02:27:07,551 --> 02:27:08,752
[SPEAKER_01]: No offense, but they don't.

2108
02:27:11,194 --> 02:27:14,577
[SPEAKER_01]: There are inconsistencies in the policy where Dabbs Lock is.

2109
02:27:16,053 --> 02:27:16,733
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's right.

2110
02:27:17,134 --> 02:27:24,678
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a frequent customer of Artery Lock and will still call them for business, but they do have an advantage over the other businesses in West Medford.

2111
02:27:26,219 --> 02:27:38,267
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to do parking enforcement meters, which is my preference, over kiosks or whatever, you have to go all the way down Route 60 because it's really a commercial slash retail

2112
02:27:38,687 --> 02:27:39,807
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got the gas stations.

2113
02:27:39,827 --> 02:27:44,348
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got the Brazilian food place, which I'm a frequent customer of.

2114
02:27:45,269 --> 02:27:47,409
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got nappies.

2115
02:27:47,449 --> 02:27:49,330
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got artery lock.

2116
02:27:49,530 --> 02:27:51,650
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a whole bunch of businesses along there.

2117
02:27:51,950 --> 02:27:52,791
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got the bike shop.

2118
02:27:52,811 --> 02:27:54,111
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bike shop on Route 60.

2119
02:27:54,671 --> 02:28:02,653
[SPEAKER_01]: They should be metered as well, because that is just as much a commercial-slash-retail place as any other place.

2120
02:28:04,313 --> 02:28:12,060
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's, you know, when Dabbs Lock came up here, I was feeling his pain because Artery Lock doesn't have to pay that, doesn't have to have that.

2121
02:28:13,401 --> 02:28:21,749
[SPEAKER_01]: With all due respect, people who come from Malden have told me that they haven't stopped at the Dunkin' Donuts in Haines Square because they don't understand the kiosk system.

2122
02:28:23,884 --> 02:28:27,486
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be $5, but I want Malden's $5, you know.

2123
02:28:28,226 --> 02:28:37,810
[SPEAKER_01]: At the very least, regular coin-operated meters should be put in place for simplicity's sake, and that would be my recommendation, to get rid of the kiosks and go with meters.

2124
02:28:38,330 --> 02:28:40,031
[SPEAKER_01]: People see meters, and they understand them.

2125
02:28:40,071 --> 02:28:42,132
[SPEAKER_01]: Haines Square has a high rental population, blah, blah, blah.

2126
02:28:43,935 --> 02:28:54,897
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this is a sensitive topic, but while I see immigrant groups from South American to Asian have small family-owned businesses in Haines Square, there are not a lot of black American-owned businesses that I know of.

2127
02:28:55,497 --> 02:29:00,498
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to see a black-owned barbershop and one other black-owned business go into the square.

2128
02:29:00,858 --> 02:29:07,259
[SPEAKER_01]: The population of that area is changing, and it would go a long way to incorporate all the new people.

2129
02:29:07,799 --> 02:29:12,040
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a couple of open storefronts currently on the Alfredo's kitchen block.

2130
02:29:13,040 --> 02:29:14,360
[SPEAKER_01]: across from the stop and shop.

2131
02:29:14,920 --> 02:29:17,201
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that would be a great place to put in a barbershop.

2132
02:29:17,561 --> 02:29:19,681
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we could reach out to the Chamber of Commerce.

2133
02:29:19,701 --> 02:29:20,821
[SPEAKER_01]: You could reach out to Neil.

2134
02:29:21,181 --> 02:29:26,782
[SPEAKER_01]: You could reach out to other, you know, people in the business community.

2135
02:29:27,142 --> 02:29:35,664
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to places, the schools where they make barbers, where they train barbers, and get somebody and say, hey, can we help you open up a barbershop?

2136
02:29:36,064 --> 02:29:41,705
[SPEAKER_01]: And just open up a barbershop, because the area is changing, and we need to change with those times.

2137
02:29:43,366 --> 02:29:43,867
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm almost done.

2138
02:29:44,468 --> 02:29:48,594
[SPEAKER_01]: In closing, I believe that all the squares should be treated the same.

2139
02:29:49,054 --> 02:29:52,379
[SPEAKER_01]: It is no secret that West Bedford is on the wealthier side of the city.

2140
02:29:52,720 --> 02:29:53,281
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that.

2141
02:29:53,601 --> 02:29:54,362
[SPEAKER_01]: I just had to say it.

2142
02:29:54,823 --> 02:29:56,305
[SPEAKER_01]: And therefore receives more attention.

2143
02:29:58,849 --> 02:30:04,012
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say that if we have meters in Haines Square, we have to have meters in West Medford.

2144
02:30:04,052 --> 02:30:07,534
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to see kiosks in West Medford and meters in Haines Square.

2145
02:30:07,894 --> 02:30:14,178
[SPEAKER_01]: It might work for Boston, because in Chinatown, they have meters, and on Newbury Street, they have kiosks, but Medford isn't Boston.

2146
02:30:14,238 --> 02:30:16,619
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanted to throw that out there.

2147
02:30:17,059 --> 02:30:19,240
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's controversial, but that's what I do.

2148
02:30:19,801 --> 02:30:20,781
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, well, thank you very much.

2149
02:30:21,081 --> 02:30:21,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Jean, don't go away.

2150
02:30:21,802 --> 02:30:22,382
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Jean.

2151
02:30:23,022 --> 02:30:23,543
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't go away.

2152
02:30:24,563 --> 02:30:25,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you could do Medford Square next week.

2153
02:30:26,264 --> 02:30:27,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.

2154
02:30:27,225 --> 02:30:27,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2155
02:30:28,024 --> 02:30:28,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Caraviello.

2156
02:30:29,125 --> 02:30:29,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Madam President.

2157
02:30:30,185 --> 02:30:31,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Jean, don't go, come back.

2158
02:30:31,266 --> 02:30:32,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes.

2159
02:30:32,086 --> 02:30:32,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Come back.

2160
02:30:32,346 --> 02:30:47,094
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I agree with you a lot of stuff that's happened on there, but you know, we have signed ordinances that aren't followed in Haines Square that if some of those signs and stuff, windows got cleaned up, would make a huge difference down there.

2161
02:30:47,594 --> 02:30:51,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Jim Silver formed a task force in South Medford.

2162
02:30:52,636 --> 02:30:55,838
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be your job, form a task force for Haines Square.

2163
02:30:56,633 --> 02:30:59,736
[SPEAKER_02]: Similarly, talk to Jim Silver, ask his advice in signing a task force.

2164
02:30:59,796 --> 02:31:00,616
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a bad idea.

2165
02:31:00,856 --> 02:31:02,638
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd be the head of that task force.

2166
02:31:02,658 --> 02:31:03,819
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'd be good at that.

2167
02:31:03,919 --> 02:31:05,260
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be right up my alley.

2168
02:31:05,280 --> 02:31:06,101
[SPEAKER_02]: My suggestion to you.

2169
02:31:06,681 --> 02:31:09,924
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the meantime, I want the mayor to look at all of those ideas, too.

2170
02:31:10,064 --> 02:31:12,746
[SPEAKER_02]: If you form a task force and you've got enough people, the mayor will listen to you.

2171
02:31:12,846 --> 02:31:13,387
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

2172
02:31:13,467 --> 02:31:13,867
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

2173
02:31:13,887 --> 02:31:14,968
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how you make noise.

2174
02:31:15,148 --> 02:31:15,508
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

2175
02:31:15,568 --> 02:31:15,909
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

2176
02:31:22,094 --> 02:31:23,535
[SPEAKER_15]: Madam President, thank you very much.

2177
02:31:24,501 --> 02:31:24,661
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

2178
02:31:24,701 --> 02:31:34,486
[SPEAKER_15]: Martin, you said something that really resonated with me, and it's something that I know our representative has been working on very hard for a number of years, and that is the closure of the Salem Street Car Barn.

2179
02:31:34,546 --> 02:31:37,607
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that's very necessary, and it's something that's long overdue.

2180
02:31:38,067 --> 02:31:48,032
[SPEAKER_15]: I think the closure of the Salem Street Car Barn would actually bring an effort and an opportunity for us to beautify the area, but more importantly, it'll improve the quality of life for the residents in the neighborhood.

2181
02:31:48,892 --> 02:31:53,034
[SPEAKER_15]: I know I've worked when I was in the legislature with Senator Shannon,

2182
02:31:53,792 --> 02:31:59,375
[SPEAKER_15]: with Representative Donato on a number of occasions in making an attempt to get the carbon out of there.

2183
02:31:59,395 --> 02:32:09,620
[SPEAKER_15]: But I'm pretty sure, if my memory serves me correctly, that the representative was able to secure some funding in order to perform a study and a plan to relocate the carbons to Wellington Circle.

2184
02:32:09,680 --> 02:32:14,102
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know how far along we are in that process, but what I'll do is reach out to him and I'll let you know.

2185
02:32:14,122 --> 02:32:14,322
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

2186
02:32:14,442 --> 02:32:15,163
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.

2187
02:32:15,223 --> 02:32:15,823
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

2188
02:32:15,843 --> 02:32:17,424
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

2189
02:32:17,464 --> 02:32:18,084
[SPEAKER_01]: Councilor Penta.

2190
02:32:18,324 --> 02:32:22,266
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, Jane, the thing that I appreciate the fact is you put a lot of effort and time

2191
02:32:23,302 --> 02:32:25,443
[SPEAKER_11]: and making a presentation of what you thought you believed in.

2192
02:32:25,483 --> 02:32:25,983
[SPEAKER_11]: You know something?

2193
02:32:26,023 --> 02:32:27,624
[SPEAKER_11]: But the city has a responsibility, too.

2194
02:32:27,844 --> 02:32:29,885
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is where I'm going to digress from Councilor Caraviello.

2195
02:32:30,145 --> 02:32:32,246
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think you have to go out there and start and do anything.

2196
02:32:32,846 --> 02:32:48,252
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a community development office who's yet to even walk these streets here in the city of Medford to find out a knock on the business doors, like the mayor, failing to find out what's going on, what's the problem, what do you think would be a better situation here for the city?

2197
02:32:48,473 --> 02:32:49,553
[SPEAKER_11]: What would you like to see to be done?

2198
02:32:50,118 --> 02:32:53,520
[SPEAKER_11]: So with that being said, I think the city has a big obligation.

2199
02:32:53,820 --> 02:33:01,384
[SPEAKER_11]: It's bad enough they're taxing people to death with food tax, and sales tax, and excise tax, and water and sewer tax, and real estate tax.

2200
02:33:01,624 --> 02:33:05,546
[SPEAKER_11]: And now you have this new crazy kiosk tax.

2201
02:33:06,326 --> 02:33:11,789
[SPEAKER_11]: And now you want the business people to go ahead and create something that the city should be doing themselves.

2202
02:33:11,829 --> 02:33:19,113
[SPEAKER_11]: If they want development to take place, if they wanted to be proactive, they'd be out there, just like Summerville was proactive, just like Winchester's proactive.

2203
02:33:19,376 --> 02:33:22,910
[SPEAKER_11]: just like Arlington is proactive, just like Lexington is proactive.

2204
02:33:23,460 --> 02:33:29,203
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't have to be those communities, but we can be proactive between and amongst ourselves within our own communities.

2205
02:33:29,723 --> 02:33:33,464
[SPEAKER_11]: And a lot of people look at West Mefford, you happen to mention it, so I'll mention West Mefford.

2206
02:33:33,865 --> 02:33:41,448
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a close-knit group of people, they work together, they look out for each other, and it's a type of business where one feeds off of another.

2207
02:33:42,268 --> 02:33:47,671
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not Newbury Street, it's just a mom and pop type of community within our own city.

2208
02:33:48,271 --> 02:33:50,172
[SPEAKER_11]: But all four sections of the city are like that.

2209
02:33:50,332 --> 02:33:51,332
[SPEAKER_11]: Mefford Square is different.

2210
02:33:51,752 --> 02:33:53,253
[SPEAKER_11]: All four sections of the city are like that.

2211
02:33:53,727 --> 02:34:13,835
[SPEAKER_11]: And once the city wakes up and decides to figure out that they need to fix potholes, they need to understand that business people need to survive, and they can't keep taxing them to that, especially when you're sitting on almost $15 million of revenue surplus and a water and sewer account and free cash, and now you're trying to tax them again with this craziness of a kiosk tax.

2212
02:34:14,615 --> 02:34:15,015
[SPEAKER_11]: It's wrong.

2213
02:34:15,055 --> 02:34:16,095
[SPEAKER_11]: In my opinion, it's wrong.

2214
02:34:16,416 --> 02:34:17,616
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the city needs to wake up.

2215
02:34:18,118 --> 02:34:28,140
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's obvious that the mayor, listen, if the mayor had any respect for this council and for you, he would have sent somebody, he would have sent something to the president of this council and told them, unfortunately, I'm not going to be here.

2216
02:34:28,160 --> 02:34:29,320
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm on vacation.

2217
02:34:29,560 --> 02:34:31,380
[SPEAKER_11]: Could you please cancel the meeting for another week?

2218
02:34:31,480 --> 02:34:32,921
[SPEAKER_11]: But no, he didn't do that.

2219
02:34:33,201 --> 02:34:35,561
[SPEAKER_11]: He knew in advance, they knew in advance he wasn't going to be here.

2220
02:34:36,121 --> 02:34:44,083
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a wasted night, unfortunately, for all the people that showed up, but hopefully the chief got the message and got the idea that there were still concerns out there that need to be corrected.

2221
02:34:44,423 --> 02:34:45,743
[SPEAKER_11]: And I stand by my resolution.

2222
02:34:46,164 --> 02:34:48,565
[SPEAKER_11]: And when I introduce it next week, I do not support this.

2223
02:34:48,946 --> 02:34:50,706
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I do not think it's right for the city.

2224
02:34:51,007 --> 02:34:52,367
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not the right step to go in.

2225
02:34:52,447 --> 02:34:58,511
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it should have started with the city taking on the responsibility first before we do anything by bringing in an outside company.

2226
02:34:58,911 --> 02:34:59,251
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

2227
02:35:01,052 --> 02:35:01,913
[SPEAKER_04]: President Dello Russo.

2228
02:35:02,193 --> 02:35:03,654
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Madam President.

2229
02:35:03,754 --> 02:35:06,035
[SPEAKER_18]: Gene, that was a wonderful presentation you made today.

2230
02:35:06,775 --> 02:35:15,160
[SPEAKER_18]: And while I thought tonight's meeting was fruitful on the discussions regarding parking, I lament the absence of one.

2231
02:35:15,996 --> 02:35:24,618
[SPEAKER_18]: But nonetheless, I think the discussions were helpful, productive, and all the discussions thus far have been so.

2232
02:35:25,078 --> 02:35:40,781
[SPEAKER_18]: And we've certainly seen this whole parking plan evolve into something really that isn't anybody's, but is now, because there's been so much input and so much change, in a sense, I think it belongs to everyone.

2233
02:35:41,621 --> 02:35:43,281
[SPEAKER_18]: That being said, with regards to your

2234
02:35:43,789 --> 02:35:46,051
[SPEAKER_18]: your ideas and your vision for Haines Square.

2235
02:35:46,531 --> 02:35:52,716
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's very laudable and very a sign of hope within this community, and I appreciate you bringing that forward.

2236
02:35:53,297 --> 02:35:59,982
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, there are some people of a particular political bent that think government should do everything for us.

2237
02:36:01,603 --> 02:36:09,189
[SPEAKER_18]: I think experience has shown, it's been pointed out to the people behind these rails that they need to pay more attention to history.

2238
02:36:09,629 --> 02:36:12,892
[SPEAKER_18]: I think if history has shown us anything, that where we rely on government

2239
02:36:13,340 --> 02:36:16,823
[SPEAKER_18]: to do everything for us, we run into problems.

2240
02:36:17,723 --> 02:36:26,590
[SPEAKER_18]: Gene, a public-private partnership for the development of anything is what is the ingredients for a success story.

2241
02:36:28,051 --> 02:36:42,022
[SPEAKER_18]: Contrary to what some people think, my experience with the Office of Community Development, when you approach them to work on projects, that they end up being very successful because of the expertise and resources that the leadership of that office brings to any endeavor.

2242
02:36:42,668 --> 02:37:04,402
[SPEAKER_18]: And if you, in the cooperation with maybe merchants in the square, property owners, members of the Chamber of Commerce, and the people in the Office of Community Development, were to engage into some project, I think that would be a tremendous recipe for success.

2243
02:37:05,042 --> 02:37:08,344
[SPEAKER_18]: And I know you have the ability to lead and do that.

2244
02:37:08,885 --> 02:37:09,525
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

2245
02:37:09,818 --> 02:37:12,140
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the space for that should happen in Haines Square.

2246
02:37:12,180 --> 02:37:15,762
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the politicians, the mayor and you guys, should all meet at Dempsey's.

2247
02:37:16,723 --> 02:37:27,350
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that the local businesses should also meet at Dempsey's or the new lunch place that we're going to build where the liquor store is.

2248
02:37:27,550 --> 02:37:29,892
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you guys can meet, and I'll be there.

2249
02:37:29,912 --> 02:37:31,093
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be happy to be there.

2250
02:37:31,553 --> 02:37:36,637
[SPEAKER_01]: And because until you guys come together because of zoning laws or whatever has to be changed,

2251
02:37:37,137 --> 02:37:41,721
[SPEAKER_01]: so that they can eat on that little tri-corner or whatever, because it's not being fully utilized.

2252
02:37:42,061 --> 02:37:44,864
[SPEAKER_01]: That little tri-corner outside of Dempsey's isn't being fully used.

2253
02:37:45,264 --> 02:37:51,069
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would be so awesome to see umbrellas and people hanging out there and relaxing on a June day.

2254
02:37:51,649 --> 02:37:51,949
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

2255
02:37:56,093 --> 02:37:56,693
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Penta.

2256
02:37:57,234 --> 02:38:01,798
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, Jean, don't go away, because my opinion is going to be a little different than Councilor Dello Russo.

2257
02:38:01,838 --> 02:38:04,460
[SPEAKER_11]: I wish he mentioned me by name, because that's who I know he was referring to.

2258
02:38:04,861 --> 02:38:06,201
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think government does have a role.

2259
02:38:06,221 --> 02:38:07,682
[SPEAKER_11]: I think government has a responsibility.

2260
02:38:07,942 --> 02:38:15,943
[SPEAKER_11]: When they tax the people in this community, or in any community, to do something and to be part of the community, they have a responsibility to go out there and work within the community.

2261
02:38:16,223 --> 02:38:29,466
[SPEAKER_11]: And when you don't see them, and when you don't hear from them, and when you see businesses closing down one at a time, one at a time, and one at a time in Medford Square, and you still not see city government going out there trying to find out what the problem is, what the reason is, that's the problem.

2262
02:38:29,766 --> 02:38:31,806
[SPEAKER_11]: It's government not doing its job.

2263
02:38:32,166 --> 02:38:33,967
[SPEAKER_11]: You can do all the job you want to help out.

2264
02:38:34,047 --> 02:38:34,667
[SPEAKER_11]: It's commendable.

2265
02:38:35,188 --> 02:38:36,768
[SPEAKER_11]: But you still need government to help you out.

2266
02:38:36,848 --> 02:38:41,950
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you don't want government to help you out, then you shouldn't even be standing here tonight, because it won't work.

2267
02:38:42,370 --> 02:38:43,370
[SPEAKER_11]: It takes two to tango.

2268
02:38:43,690 --> 02:38:46,231
[SPEAKER_11]: But before it takes two to tango, we have to remember one thing.

2269
02:38:46,511 --> 02:38:55,893
[SPEAKER_11]: Jim Silver and Smartco and South Metro, it was because of those people being persistent, being persistent.

2270
02:38:55,933 --> 02:39:00,814
[SPEAKER_11]: Because if the city was doing its job, he wouldn't have had to been so persistent.

2271
02:39:01,234 --> 02:39:03,715
[SPEAKER_11]: And thankfully, the chief was there on a particular night

2272
02:39:03,991 --> 02:39:06,492
[SPEAKER_11]: And he walked the neighborhood with them to see what was going on.

2273
02:39:06,772 --> 02:39:10,714
[SPEAKER_11]: He is an exemplary person as a municipal employee.

2274
02:39:10,914 --> 02:39:13,395
[SPEAKER_11]: If all the department heads acted like him, we'd have no problem.

2275
02:39:13,755 --> 02:39:16,757
[SPEAKER_11]: You wouldn't even need a mayor because everybody would be doing their job.

2276
02:39:16,897 --> 02:39:18,878
[SPEAKER_11]: The guy goes over and beyond the call of duty.

2277
02:39:19,398 --> 02:39:20,498
[SPEAKER_11]: This is not his job, though.

2278
02:39:20,919 --> 02:39:24,040
[SPEAKER_11]: His job is to be the chief of police, to make sure our community is safe.

2279
02:39:24,680 --> 02:39:29,222
[SPEAKER_11]: He should not have to be the parking commissioner, so to speak, whatever it might be.

2280
02:39:29,382 --> 02:39:30,363
[SPEAKER_11]: But unfortunately, the mayor

2281
02:39:32,401 --> 02:39:33,082
[SPEAKER_11]: God bless you chief.

2282
02:39:33,342 --> 02:39:34,022
[SPEAKER_11]: Why are you doing it?

2283
02:39:34,443 --> 02:39:34,863
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

2284
02:39:35,604 --> 02:39:36,464
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think you deserve it.

2285
02:39:37,345 --> 02:39:42,970
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just think there's a perfect example of government not being responsible for what they're supposed to be doing.

2286
02:39:43,250 --> 02:39:44,511
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the mayor's program.

2287
02:39:45,572 --> 02:39:47,833
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the mayor's program, not the chief or the council.

2288
02:39:47,914 --> 02:39:48,934
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the mayor's program.

2289
02:39:49,315 --> 02:40:00,844
[SPEAKER_11]: And if he wants to go on vacation for which he's entitled to, then we should have been given the respect that he wasn't going to be here tonight by the people in his office who knew he wasn't going to be here because everybody that showed up early tonight expected him to be here.

2290
02:40:01,375 --> 02:40:02,477
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's the message that went out.

2291
02:40:02,677 --> 02:40:04,500
[SPEAKER_11]: And that was the vote of the city council last week.

2292
02:40:04,900 --> 02:40:06,383
[SPEAKER_11]: Seven, seven to nothing.

2293
02:40:06,403 --> 02:40:06,723
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

2294
02:40:07,665 --> 02:40:09,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks, point of information.

2295
02:40:09,788 --> 02:40:10,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Camuso.

2296
02:40:10,629 --> 02:40:14,615
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

2297
02:40:15,356 --> 02:40:17,139
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I can appreciate that.

2298
02:40:18,213 --> 02:40:35,436
[SPEAKER_09]: and I wish we did get notified, but I certainly understand from a homeowner's standpoint that the mayor probably would want to go on vacation and not have you running around the coffee shops yelling that he's out of town and so that someone can probably maybe go to his house and burglarize it because he's on vacation.

2299
02:40:35,876 --> 02:40:44,838
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's just, like I said, I just find it quite amusing, Madam President.

2300
02:40:45,138 --> 02:40:45,658
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Marks.

2301
02:40:47,420 --> 02:40:50,921
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I said, I can understand, but... Is that a point of information?

2302
02:40:51,421 --> 02:40:51,621
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2303
02:40:52,382 --> 02:40:55,503
[SPEAKER_09]: No, when you go to Florida with your friends, you don't tell people.

2304
02:40:55,583 --> 02:40:56,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, hey.

2305
02:40:57,383 --> 02:40:57,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey.

2306
02:40:57,523 --> 02:40:57,643
[SPEAKER_05]: Order.

2307
02:40:57,964 --> 02:40:58,584
[SPEAKER_09]: Nor should you.

2308
02:40:58,884 --> 02:40:59,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks.

2309
02:41:01,085 --> 02:41:03,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President, Madam President.

2310
02:41:04,386 --> 02:41:07,387
[SPEAKER_03]: And I appreciate Jean, and I appreciate your vision.

2311
02:41:08,147 --> 02:41:17,030
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think, you know, when it comes to the Office of Community Development, we as a community need to expect more from the Office of Community Development.

2312
02:41:17,560 --> 02:41:20,607
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the reason why we have an Office of Community Development.

2313
02:41:21,428 --> 02:41:27,181
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, they do yeoman's work when it comes to finding grants and rehabbing parks.

2314
02:41:27,946 --> 02:41:30,908
[SPEAKER_03]: or allocating community block grant money every year.

2315
02:41:31,268 --> 02:41:32,850
[SPEAKER_03]: They do a tremendous job.

2316
02:41:33,370 --> 02:41:43,357
[SPEAKER_03]: But all you need to do is look at the five business districts in this community and wonder why we haven't revitalized one of our business districts in the last 25 years.

2317
02:41:44,178 --> 02:41:45,278
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all you need to wonder.

2318
02:41:45,999 --> 02:41:53,584
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it's clear to me that the Office of Community Development has fallen far short of the mark when it comes to redevelopment.

2319
02:41:54,385 --> 02:41:56,366
[SPEAKER_03]: This administration has been in charge for 28 years,

2320
02:41:57,830 --> 02:42:05,956
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would submit to anyone in this community, Medford Square is no better off now than it was 28 years ago.

2321
02:42:06,476 --> 02:42:14,181
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would submit to you that the square was better off 28 years ago than what we have down there currently now.

2322
02:42:14,642 --> 02:42:27,130
[SPEAKER_03]: The council voted several months back on Riverside Ave, the transportation little shuttle that we have across from the CVS on Riverside behind the burial ground.

2323
02:42:27,698 --> 02:42:31,759
[SPEAKER_03]: We voted to have it looked at for a possible repurpose.

2324
02:42:32,219 --> 02:42:33,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, it's falling apart.

2325
02:42:34,419 --> 02:42:35,459
[SPEAKER_03]: The roof is leaking.

2326
02:42:36,180 --> 02:42:40,060
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in deplorable condition, and it's being utilized for next to nothing.

2327
02:42:40,780 --> 02:42:45,881
[SPEAKER_03]: And the response back we got from the administration was they'll take it under advisement.

2328
02:42:45,981 --> 02:42:53,723
[SPEAKER_03]: These are the type of things that, when issues are brought up, that there's no one at City Hall carrying the water.

2329
02:42:54,003 --> 02:42:55,783
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no one at City Hall looking into it.

2330
02:42:56,425 --> 02:42:58,185
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the problem that we face.

2331
02:42:59,006 --> 02:43:16,729
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, until there's a new administration in this city, we're going to see our business districts the way they are, in deplorable condition, in need of updating, in need of new traffic studies, new pedestrian crossings, traffic calming approaches, new facades.

2332
02:43:17,149 --> 02:43:25,251
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole issue — and it's — we spoke about Haines Square, I think it was last week, about the fire that took place at the Lucky Dragon Chinese restaurant.

2333
02:43:25,647 --> 02:43:26,868
[SPEAKER_03]: That was over two years ago.

2334
02:43:27,749 --> 02:43:32,092
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's still boarded up with action signs in the window.

2335
02:43:32,652 --> 02:43:33,933
[SPEAKER_03]: That was two years ago.

2336
02:43:34,453 --> 02:43:39,917
[SPEAKER_03]: How does a community allow an establishment in a business district to stay boarded up like that?

2337
02:43:40,177 --> 02:43:41,198
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't understand.

2338
02:43:41,598 --> 02:43:47,543
[SPEAKER_03]: And is there any involvement from the Community Development Office or the Building Commissioner's Office to do something about it?

2339
02:43:48,183 --> 02:43:53,587
[SPEAKER_03]: You're talking about the liquor store as a blighted look and area, what about a boarded up

2340
02:43:54,666 --> 02:43:57,668
[SPEAKER_03]: establishment that's been caught on fire two years ago.

2341
02:43:58,489 --> 02:44:10,519
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is, I think, what we're seeing across the community, not just Haynes Square, West Medford, the hillside, and our main anchor, which is Medford Square.

2342
02:44:11,320 --> 02:44:20,688
[SPEAKER_03]: And the mayor has commissioned three separate reports to revitalize Medford Square, has spent several hundred thousand dollars to come out with

2343
02:44:21,048 --> 02:44:25,050
[SPEAKER_03]: a plan to revitalize Medford Square and has done nothing.

2344
02:44:25,570 --> 02:44:28,411
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's over a 25 year process.

2345
02:44:29,211 --> 02:44:49,840
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess when we talk about parking enforcement taking five years and the mayor's vision, that's pretty quick because the revitalization of Medford Square is still ongoing after 25 years in the police department after 50 something years chief, which we won't call you up to the podium in the library, 50 something years.

2346
02:44:50,742 --> 02:44:56,463
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I guess it's par for the course how we're working and, you know, I agree.

2347
02:44:56,503 --> 02:44:59,004
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it should be done by a citizen advisory board.

2348
02:44:59,364 --> 02:45:03,985
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be done by the people that we're paying their salary, hefty salaries.

2349
02:45:05,065 --> 02:45:07,685
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, that's what should take place in this community.

2350
02:45:08,066 --> 02:45:11,666
[SPEAKER_03]: And the mayor needs to put an emphasis on the Office of Community Development.

2351
02:45:12,166 --> 02:45:16,607
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of all their staff is probably seven times larger than our staff.

2352
02:45:17,547 --> 02:45:20,308
[SPEAKER_03]: We have one full-time person who's the director.

2353
02:45:20,907 --> 02:45:24,688
[SPEAKER_03]: one part-time person, and there may be someone else answering the phones in the office.

2354
02:45:25,368 --> 02:45:26,848
[SPEAKER_03]: That's our Office of Community Development.

2355
02:45:29,089 --> 02:45:42,312
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what you're gonna get out of it, other than what we're already getting, which is just the minimal day-to-day, keep the office going, but no improvements to our infrastructure or any thought of revitalization.

2356
02:45:42,532 --> 02:45:44,573
[SPEAKER_03]: But I appreciate your thoughts, Jeanne.

2357
02:45:44,633 --> 02:45:44,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2358
02:45:45,213 --> 02:45:46,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Caraviello.

2359
02:45:48,114 --> 02:45:48,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Madam President.

2360
02:45:49,348 --> 02:45:50,589
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Councilor Pence was right.

2361
02:45:50,609 --> 02:45:51,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Assistance pays off.

2362
02:45:51,750 --> 02:46:02,438
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, again, I know you won't take it, but that's sometimes the ground effort from the citizens that will get people motivated and going in this building.

2363
02:46:02,458 --> 02:46:06,220
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you talked about the people, you know, the little square there.

2364
02:46:06,781 --> 02:46:12,745
[SPEAKER_02]: All that restaurant has to do is apply to the Board of Health for a permit, and they could put the tables and umbrellas out there.

2365
02:46:13,826 --> 02:46:16,788
[SPEAKER_02]: A year and a half ago, I brought in Harvard University into the city,

2366
02:46:17,412 --> 02:46:21,415
[SPEAKER_02]: And they come up with 20 low-cost ideas to enhance the city.

2367
02:46:21,895 --> 02:46:24,057
[SPEAKER_02]: And we didn't take them up on not one of them.

2368
02:46:24,797 --> 02:46:25,297
[SPEAKER_02]: See, that's the shame.

2369
02:46:25,337 --> 02:46:25,878
[SPEAKER_02]: They were over here.

2370
02:46:25,918 --> 02:46:27,339
[SPEAKER_02]: They were on display for a month.

2371
02:46:27,739 --> 02:46:38,626
[SPEAKER_02]: And as I said, the students spent three months here picking out places to clean with all things that were low-cost, because their project was they had to keep everyone on a budget.

2372
02:46:39,027 --> 02:46:41,108
[SPEAKER_02]: And we didn't take not one of the suggestions.

2373
02:46:41,749 --> 02:46:46,692
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had one of the number one landscape architects in the world

2374
02:46:47,233 --> 02:46:49,334
[SPEAKER_02]: in this building and we took no suggestions from them.

2375
02:46:50,534 --> 02:46:51,754
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Dello Russo.

2376
02:46:52,154 --> 02:46:56,896
[SPEAKER_18]: Madam President, a motion that this presentation be forwarded to the mayor for a response.

2377
02:46:58,956 --> 02:47:06,638
[SPEAKER_04]: What type of, that he review, that he review Haines Square redevelopment?

2378
02:47:07,039 --> 02:47:07,259
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

2379
02:47:10,039 --> 02:47:11,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Marks.

2380
02:47:11,780 --> 02:47:15,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe if we can ask the mayor more of a poignant question,

2381
02:47:16,051 --> 02:47:25,055
[SPEAKER_03]: of what are his plans to revitalize our five business districts, because you can only be told so many times about a plan that was drafted 20 years ago.

2382
02:47:26,836 --> 02:47:27,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

2383
02:47:27,456 --> 02:47:38,741
[SPEAKER_03]: You can only be told so many times about that outdated plan until people realize and unmask the masquerade that's going on that nothing is happening in this city.

2384
02:47:43,083 --> 02:47:44,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion for approval.

2385
02:47:44,453 --> 02:47:45,613
[SPEAKER_04]: by Councilor Dello Russo.

2386
02:47:45,713 --> 02:47:46,473
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

2387
02:47:46,953 --> 02:47:47,614
[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed?

2388
02:47:47,754 --> 02:47:48,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

2389
02:47:49,194 --> 02:47:50,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Offered by Councilor Caraviello.

2390
02:47:51,374 --> 02:47:55,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Please discuss the after hour and weekend truck problems on Auburn Street.

2391
02:47:56,695 --> 02:47:59,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Chief, if you can, that's what I asked yesterday, if you can talk about those for a second.

2392
02:48:00,236 --> 02:48:09,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Chief, over the last couple of months, the traffic on Auburn Street, especially on the weekends and after hours, with the 18 wheels going down there, has kind of increased an awful lot.

2393
02:48:10,598 --> 02:48:12,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have any set hours when those trucks

2394
02:48:13,211 --> 02:48:14,052
[SPEAKER_02]: should be going down there.

2395
02:48:14,072 --> 02:48:19,536
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they're going down there Saturday and Sunday nights at 10, 11, 12 o'clock at night to make deliveries on Whole Foods.

2396
02:48:20,396 --> 02:48:22,958
[SPEAKER_14]: That's somewhat an age-old problem.

2397
02:48:22,978 --> 02:48:25,360
[SPEAKER_14]: I have heard that it's increased over the past couple of months.

2398
02:48:26,361 --> 02:48:32,145
[SPEAKER_14]: One of the issues there is that that street probably should definitely be a no-heavy trucking street.

2399
02:48:32,585 --> 02:48:33,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I know they can't get on.

2400
02:48:33,586 --> 02:48:35,688
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't know how far they can get on the parkway.

2401
02:48:35,708 --> 02:48:38,810
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, they're coming down there.

2402
02:48:38,830 --> 02:48:42,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen, it's bad enough they come down there during the week when there's school going.

2403
02:48:43,233 --> 02:48:45,575
[SPEAKER_02]: They come down there on a Saturday night and Sunday night at 11 o'clock.

2404
02:48:45,715 --> 02:48:47,276
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just a question of where they're going to.

2405
02:48:47,356 --> 02:48:48,497
[SPEAKER_14]: My assumption is Whole Foods.

2406
02:48:48,517 --> 02:48:49,098
[SPEAKER_14]: They're going to Whole Foods.

2407
02:48:49,118 --> 02:48:50,599
[SPEAKER_14]: Because there's no place else they could go.

2408
02:48:52,240 --> 02:48:53,942
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll speak with the management at Whole Foods.

2409
02:48:54,002 --> 02:49:02,028
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that at one point in time, we did have it rerouted and trucks would have to go into West Medford Square or make a turn on Canal Street.

2410
02:49:02,048 --> 02:49:06,972
[SPEAKER_14]: But it was probably more likely that they'd have to go to Harvard Avenue and back onto Boston Avenue.

2411
02:49:06,992 --> 02:49:10,915
[SPEAKER_14]: But then they couldn't clear the bridge on the parkway, that bridge by U Hall.

2412
02:49:12,303 --> 02:49:15,746
[SPEAKER_14]: That was a problem, but I know that it has been a problem.

2413
02:49:15,766 --> 02:49:19,688
[SPEAKER_14]: Auburn Street's just a, I mean, it really should not be a truck.

2414
02:49:19,748 --> 02:49:23,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it possible to set some hours when they can't go down that way?

2415
02:49:23,091 --> 02:49:24,451
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's not fair to those people.

2416
02:49:24,471 --> 02:49:30,656
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, let's say bad enough they have to come down there during the week, but, you know, they shouldn't be coming down there on Saturday and Sunday nights.

2417
02:49:30,956 --> 02:49:39,862
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I think the first step would be to talk with the people at Whole Foods and find out why they may be getting deliveries or why trucks would be leaving their establishment at

2418
02:49:40,326 --> 02:49:42,187
[SPEAKER_14]: on those nights at those hours.

2419
02:49:42,747 --> 02:49:46,429
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sure that they could arrange for the deliveries to go at a different time.

2420
02:49:46,969 --> 02:49:59,315
[SPEAKER_14]: And I've always been told by MDC before the DCR that trucks could travel as long as it's basically a block or two to the location they could travel on that parkway.

2421
02:49:59,655 --> 02:50:07,178
[SPEAKER_14]: But they really, as they come out of Auburn Street, they're not supposed to be making that turn onto, if they come out of Auburn Street by Whole Foods, and they get onto the parkway.

2422
02:50:08,883 --> 02:50:10,243
[SPEAKER_02]: going down Auburn Street to go.

2423
02:50:10,443 --> 02:50:11,264
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where they're coming from.

2424
02:50:11,364 --> 02:50:29,047
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not coming across, but I mean, they might be coming that way too, but if you could speak with the manager there and report back to us some type of solution, because I say those people, it's bad enough they come down during the week, but to come down on Saturday and Sunday nights, it's kind of pushing the envelope there.

2425
02:50:29,528 --> 02:50:30,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'll check with them.

2426
02:50:30,728 --> 02:50:31,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Chief.

2427
02:50:32,089 --> 02:50:36,272
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you on the motion of Councilor, uh, caveat for approval and forwarding to the police chief.

2428
02:50:36,652 --> 02:50:43,857
[SPEAKER_18]: All those in favor, all those post motion passes, uh, papers in hand to the clerk offered by Councilor Marks.

2429
02:50:44,437 --> 02:50:50,141
[SPEAKER_18]: Be resolved that the community mitigation fund under the gaming act be discussed.

2430
02:50:50,621 --> 02:50:51,521
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Marks.

2431
02:50:52,442 --> 02:50:53,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, thank you, Mr. President.

2432
02:50:54,043 --> 02:50:58,326
[SPEAKER_03]: It was brought to my attention recently by a method resident that

2433
02:50:59,313 --> 02:51:06,577
[SPEAKER_03]: The Gaming Act, which we're all aware of, which was the creating legislation to create casinos in this community.

2434
02:51:08,398 --> 02:51:20,645
[SPEAKER_03]: As part of that, there was a community mitigation fund that was established, and this was to offset costs related to gaming for communities and surrounding communities.

2435
02:51:21,205 --> 02:51:26,869
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a one-time, and this is why I wanted to bring it up tonight, there's a one-time

2436
02:51:29,278 --> 02:51:45,910
[SPEAKER_03]: 2015 reserve that's allocated to surrounding communities, of which we are named right within the one-time policy that was put out as being one of the surrounding communities.

2437
02:51:46,451 --> 02:51:52,015
[SPEAKER_03]: And it states, if I could read it, Mr. President, because there's a time frame that's associated with this.

2438
02:51:52,630 --> 02:52:12,934
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, in recognition that communities may not be able to demonstrate many significant impacts by February 2, 2015, and in recognition of the commission's emphasis on proper local planning, the commission has established a one-time local reserve for the 2015 Community Mitigation Fund Program.

2439
02:52:13,434 --> 02:52:20,836
[SPEAKER_03]: The commission has reserved $100,000 for each designated surrounding community, each community which entered

2440
02:52:21,297 --> 02:52:31,143
[SPEAKER_03]: into the nearby community agreement with a license and any community that petitioned to be a surrounding community to a gaming license, which we are one of them, Mr. President.

2441
02:52:31,584 --> 02:52:37,307
[SPEAKER_03]: This reserve can be used to cover impacts that may arise in 2015 or thereafter.

2442
02:52:37,327 --> 02:52:47,073
[SPEAKER_03]: It may also be used for planning, either to determine how to achieve further benefits from a facility or to avoid or minimize any adverse impacts.

2443
02:52:47,594 --> 02:52:49,675
[SPEAKER_03]: We've all spoken, Mr. President, about

2444
02:52:50,353 --> 02:52:53,215
[SPEAKER_03]: the need for infrastructure improvements in Wellington Circle.

2445
02:52:54,536 --> 02:52:58,538
[SPEAKER_03]: The deadline to apply for this is February 2nd.

2446
02:52:59,119 --> 02:53:10,006
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to send a response from this council to the administration to, first of all, to see if the administration has applied for this, where the deadline is approaching.

2447
02:53:11,046 --> 02:53:16,890
[SPEAKER_03]: If not, that they apply immediately, and that also this council go on record, you know,

2448
02:53:17,828 --> 02:53:41,087
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe the number one concern is the traffic impact from what I've heard from residents and also from living in the Wellington area and what can be done to improve some of the potential congestion in the Wellington area which we all know will be one of the main major thoroughfares to the Wynn Casino when it eventually comes.

2449
02:53:41,447 --> 02:53:43,449
[SPEAKER_18]: If I may from the chair point out that

2450
02:53:44,312 --> 02:53:51,358
[SPEAKER_18]: There's been a longstanding flooding problem on Middlesex Avenue at the intersections of 1st and 2nd Street and beyond.

2451
02:53:51,418 --> 02:53:57,343
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm wondering if this money could be used to mitigate those drainage inefficiencies as well.

2452
02:53:58,765 --> 02:53:59,806
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a great suggestion.

2453
02:54:01,007 --> 02:54:08,813
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think we should go on record at least asking the administration if they've applied before the February 2nd deadline and also

2454
02:54:10,908 --> 02:54:13,410
[SPEAKER_03]: What are the thoughts of the use of the $100,000?

2455
02:54:14,090 --> 02:54:21,314
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would say transportation, flooding issues in the general area, I think, is a worthy suggestion.

2456
02:54:21,794 --> 02:54:38,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, recently, our own Councilor Rick Caraviello was named to the Community Mitigation Committee by the mayor, and he will sit on this committee as one person from this community and be fighting for

2457
02:54:39,365 --> 02:54:50,593
[SPEAKER_03]: mitigation money to improve infrastructure and other economic engines in our community to help with the potential loss that a casino may bring into the local economy.

2458
02:54:51,213 --> 02:55:01,461
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, Councilor Caraviello, with his background in the chamber and his background in the community, I think was the perfect fit for this particular position.

2459
02:55:01,961 --> 02:55:05,924
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would like to put that in the form of a resolution on the actual 2015

2460
02:55:07,793 --> 02:55:13,436
[SPEAKER_03]: reserve money, $100,000 that is earmarked to surrounding communities in which we were named.

2461
02:55:13,716 --> 02:55:13,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Each.

2462
02:55:14,576 --> 02:55:14,756
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.

2463
02:55:14,796 --> 02:55:15,116
[SPEAKER_18]: Correct.

2464
02:55:15,176 --> 02:55:15,336
[SPEAKER_18]: Each.

2465
02:55:15,697 --> 02:55:16,057
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2466
02:55:16,377 --> 02:55:22,079
[SPEAKER_18]: So, uh, on the motion of a council of marks, as he has explained to Mr. Clerk, council caraviello.

2467
02:55:22,660 --> 02:55:22,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

2468
02:55:22,960 --> 02:55:23,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2469
02:55:23,680 --> 02:55:24,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, thank you.

2470
02:55:24,380 --> 02:55:25,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Council marks for that.

2471
02:55:25,681 --> 02:55:28,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I have tried with the mere being away.

2472
02:55:28,983 --> 02:55:33,405
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if we've applied for that $100,000 rent that's out there.

2473
02:55:35,245 --> 02:55:39,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Once he gets back, I tried to get a hold of him, but once he gets back, I'll find out.

2474
02:55:40,746 --> 02:55:48,767
[SPEAKER_02]: But as it was explained to me, there's also going to be other pools of money that are going to be available for all the cities in town.

2475
02:55:49,047 --> 02:55:52,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, for people who don't understand, this is not just a wind casino.

2476
02:55:52,568 --> 02:55:58,169
[SPEAKER_02]: This is all the casinos in the whole state that are going to be coming out of this pool.

2477
02:55:58,709 --> 02:56:04,150
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll hope to address the issues that this community faces going forward.

2478
02:56:04,642 --> 02:56:06,783
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully some funds will be coming this way, Mr. President.

2479
02:56:07,163 --> 02:56:12,464
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, uh, councilor Caffiello and the community can trust in your, your abilities.

2480
02:56:12,844 --> 02:56:13,204
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2481
02:56:13,884 --> 02:56:15,885
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, on the motion, uh, councilor Penta.

2482
02:56:16,365 --> 02:56:24,827
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's interesting because this Medford city council was in the forefront of wanting to be a surrounding community contender right from the beginning.

2483
02:56:25,468 --> 02:56:29,849
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think there is maybe five to six resolutions that were offered on there.

2484
02:56:29,889 --> 02:56:34,450
[SPEAKER_11]: Myself included along with council Longo current as it related to getting ourselves on there.

2485
02:56:34,965 --> 02:56:42,930
[SPEAKER_11]: And the interesting part about all of this, I think we sent resolutions to the Mass Gaming Commission, and I believe we also sent one to the Commonwealth of Mass.

2486
02:56:42,990 --> 02:56:46,513
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it was the Attorney General's Office that needed to go there.

2487
02:56:47,073 --> 02:56:54,358
[SPEAKER_11]: Bottom line to all of that is we had asked the mayor on numerous occasions to be part of the surrounding community application.

2488
02:56:55,058 --> 02:57:01,062
[SPEAKER_11]: Not only did he ignore us, but he also went forward and did whatever he did to subsequently reach, I think it was $250,000.

2489
02:57:03,085 --> 02:57:08,929
[SPEAKER_11]: and money thus far from the Wynn Casino group of people who made the application to the Mass Gaming Commission.

2490
02:57:09,450 --> 02:57:12,152
[SPEAKER_11]: Putting all of that aside, we now have a situation.

2491
02:57:12,952 --> 02:57:25,061
[SPEAKER_11]: We have, and I don't know if this is called mitigation money, I don't know what the proper terminology is, but if we have the ability to have $100,000 come to us, whether it be for use for the Wellington area, whether it's the First Street, whether it's for flooding.

2492
02:57:25,542 --> 02:57:31,086
[SPEAKER_11]: Once again, I'd like to amend the motion that the mayor consult with the council as it relates

2493
02:57:31,413 --> 02:57:33,174
[SPEAKER_11]: for the purposes of using this money.

2494
02:57:33,635 --> 02:57:40,380
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no sense in you being on the committee, Rick, that the mayor just appointed you to, if the money is going to wind up going for whatever he wants to do.

2495
02:57:40,680 --> 02:57:43,562
[SPEAKER_11]: All you are going to be doing is a conduit to bring the money into the city.

2496
02:57:44,703 --> 02:57:50,447
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, it's another example, if the mayor doesn't want to participate with the council in our request, then it's for naught.

2497
02:57:50,487 --> 02:57:53,430
[SPEAKER_11]: We're just giving him carte blanche to do whatever he wants whenever he gets this money.

2498
02:57:55,171 --> 02:57:56,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Point of information, Councilor Caraviello.

2499
02:57:56,712 --> 02:58:00,395
[SPEAKER_02]: The money that will be asked for will be for a specific

2500
02:58:01,145 --> 02:58:04,307
[SPEAKER_02]: It won't just be, here's a check and run with it.

2501
02:58:04,467 --> 02:58:10,992
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll make the specific thing for the Wellington neighborhood, whether it's for the rotary intersection or to decrease the water.

2502
02:58:11,092 --> 02:58:12,153
[SPEAKER_02]: There's multiple issues.

2503
02:58:13,114 --> 02:58:14,855
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, the multiple issues got to come from the council.

2504
02:58:15,055 --> 02:58:15,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

2505
02:58:15,535 --> 02:58:19,278
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are multiple issues for mitigation money, not just Wellington.

2506
02:58:19,318 --> 02:58:19,978
[SPEAKER_11]: We're talking about this $100,000.

2507
02:58:20,039 --> 02:58:20,299
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

2508
02:58:20,399 --> 02:58:20,599
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

2509
02:58:20,639 --> 02:58:23,141
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you want it to do?

2510
02:58:23,201 --> 02:58:24,161
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilman, you brought it up.

2511
02:58:24,422 --> 02:58:25,382
[SPEAKER_11]: What is your suggestion?

2512
02:58:26,543 --> 02:58:27,904
[SPEAKER_11]: Mike?

2513
02:58:27,984 --> 02:58:28,845
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry, Councilor.

2514
02:58:29,567 --> 02:58:31,028
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, Councilor, you have the chair.

2515
02:58:31,448 --> 02:58:32,329
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm asking him a question.

2516
02:58:32,529 --> 02:58:35,371
[SPEAKER_18]: So through the chair to Councilor Marks.

2517
02:58:35,451 --> 02:58:40,795
[SPEAKER_03]: My suggestion, as I stated, is to look at infrastructure improvements, i.e.

2518
02:58:41,155 --> 02:58:46,679
[SPEAKER_03]: transportation improvements in the Wellington area, because I think that's going to be the biggest impact.

2519
02:58:47,559 --> 02:58:51,062
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what I've heard from residents and business owners and so forth.

2520
02:58:51,382 --> 02:58:55,525
[SPEAKER_03]: And there will be some other impact to the local economy and businesses in that area.

2521
02:58:55,909 --> 02:58:58,471
[SPEAKER_03]: but I think this should be one of the first priorities.

2522
02:58:58,711 --> 02:59:14,662
[SPEAKER_18]: So on the motion of Councilor Marks as amended by Councilor Penta, that the mayor consult the city council before making any expenditure of grant monies given as mitigation under the casino act.

2523
02:59:15,042 --> 02:59:16,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Caraviello.

2524
02:59:16,443 --> 02:59:18,804
[SPEAKER_02]: I have not had the opportunity to attend the meeting yet.

2525
02:59:18,844 --> 02:59:24,308
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, once I, I, I, I've gone to a meeting, I can inform this council on what,

2526
02:59:25,641 --> 02:59:27,182
[SPEAKER_02]: what lies ahead.

2527
02:59:27,422 --> 02:59:28,802
[SPEAKER_11]: February 2nd is right around the corner.

2528
02:59:29,783 --> 02:59:31,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if the mayor's not here, I can't.

2529
02:59:32,264 --> 02:59:35,445
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, the council resolution go forward as amended.

2530
02:59:38,766 --> 02:59:42,828
[SPEAKER_02]: I will report back to the council on what lies ahead and what type of funds are available.

2531
02:59:43,168 --> 02:59:44,588
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, councillors.

2532
02:59:44,909 --> 02:59:47,029
[SPEAKER_16]: And Councilor Knight wishes to speak on the matter.

2533
02:59:47,610 --> 02:59:49,030
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

2534
02:59:49,370 --> 02:59:53,752
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Marks brings up a good point about the impact that

2535
02:59:54,521 --> 02:59:59,245
[SPEAKER_15]: a gaming facility is going to have on our transportation infrastructure here in the city of Medford.

2536
02:59:59,885 --> 03:00:04,249
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we're sitting here talking about some grant funds that are available to us and what to do with them.

2537
03:00:04,269 --> 03:00:16,499
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think it might make sense for us to maybe look at hiring a full-time transportation planner, someone that can look at the issues that are affecting our city, can determine what's going on, what impact they're having, and what direction we need to go.

2538
03:00:16,539 --> 03:00:18,320
[SPEAKER_15]: But someone that's a professional, not someone that we're going to give $100,000

2539
03:00:19,663 --> 03:00:43,190
[SPEAKER_15]: to do a study to give us the study back and then disappear, but someone that's going to be on staff, or someone maybe that we can work with regionally with our neighbors in Malden and Everett, who are also going to be impacted at Wellington Circle by the, well, maybe not so much Everett, because they're going to have PNC or money coming in from wind management, but Malden, to help us out and maybe approach this issue regionally so that we can pool our resources and that we can get more bang for our buck.

2540
03:00:43,990 --> 03:00:45,111
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

2541
03:00:45,271 --> 03:00:46,311
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Penta.

2542
03:00:46,531 --> 03:00:47,251
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of information.

2543
03:00:47,291 --> 03:00:49,232
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Marks, I mean, Councilor Knight,

2544
03:00:49,926 --> 03:00:53,007
[SPEAKER_11]: brings up an interesting point, but the city some years ago did apply for that.

2545
03:00:53,507 --> 03:00:54,827
[SPEAKER_11]: And they put a request in the budget.

2546
03:00:54,847 --> 03:01:04,670
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it was for, I think it was almost $80,000, $90,000 at one time for the purposes of having a transportation, I won't use the word consultant, a transportation person upstairs.

2547
03:01:04,930 --> 03:01:07,371
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think we got the idea because of what Somerville was doing.

2548
03:01:07,711 --> 03:01:15,233
[SPEAKER_11]: And at that point in time, I believe Somerville had 14 people in their office of community development and how they were getting so efficient is they hired an outside professional person

2549
03:01:15,570 --> 03:01:17,231
[SPEAKER_11]: to be their transportation consultant.

2550
03:01:17,592 --> 03:01:20,834
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's one of the people that made the takeoff of the piece of property over there.

2551
03:01:21,274 --> 03:01:30,662
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got no problem supporting them there, but these are all, I think, budgetary issues, because if you take that money from the $100,000, you've got to keep that position going each and every year.

2552
03:01:32,664 --> 03:01:40,169
[SPEAKER_11]: I like the idea of bringing it up again, but I think it's just, you know, I think it's just something that this whole budget has to be looked at as to where we're going.

2553
03:01:40,249 --> 03:01:43,832
[SPEAKER_11]: Each and every year we wind up in the last four years with a million dollar surplus.

2554
03:01:44,392 --> 03:01:47,515
[SPEAKER_11]: So we know that there is money there to hire additional people.

2555
03:01:47,595 --> 03:01:55,540
[SPEAKER_11]: The school committee just got an additional two and a half million dollars this year, and they've hired many more administrators, more than we've able to do on this side of the street.

2556
03:01:56,001 --> 03:01:57,642
[SPEAKER_11]: So something's got to make the turn.

2557
03:01:58,207 --> 03:02:04,271
[SPEAKER_11]: that gets to where you're talking about, Councilor Knight, what Councilor Marks was talking about, where this city should be moving forward.

2558
03:02:04,291 --> 03:02:10,495
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody's moving forward around us, and all we're doing is just staying still and becoming stagnant, and that's wrong.

2559
03:02:10,575 --> 03:02:11,416
[SPEAKER_11]: It shouldn't be that way.

2560
03:02:11,896 --> 03:02:12,937
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not a poor city.

2561
03:02:13,477 --> 03:02:15,458
[SPEAKER_11]: We are financially endowed right now.

2562
03:02:15,758 --> 03:02:25,505
[SPEAKER_11]: We have good money, and we should be investing it in good projects, not just keep increasing, taxing the people, and just keeping the coffers, and just filling them up and filling them up.

2563
03:02:26,385 --> 03:02:27,466
[SPEAKER_11]: It just doesn't work that way.

2564
03:02:28,079 --> 03:02:29,860
[SPEAKER_11]: And our best example is our sister city.

2565
03:02:30,281 --> 03:02:31,121
[SPEAKER_11]: Just look at Somerville.

2566
03:02:31,141 --> 03:02:34,984
[SPEAKER_11]: Years ago, people... Years ago, I wouldn't want to move to Somerville.

2567
03:02:35,284 --> 03:02:37,505
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, you can't even get into Somerville.

2568
03:02:37,525 --> 03:02:39,366
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't even touch the real estate in Somerville.

2569
03:02:41,628 --> 03:02:41,928
[SPEAKER_18]: That's it.

2570
03:02:42,648 --> 03:02:43,449
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Councilor Penta.

2571
03:02:43,489 --> 03:02:48,472
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion of Councilor Matz, amended by Councilor Penta and Councilor Knight.

2572
03:02:48,812 --> 03:02:49,633
[SPEAKER_18]: All those in favor?

2573
03:02:49,653 --> 03:02:50,994
[SPEAKER_18]: Roll call, Mr. President.

2574
03:02:51,034 --> 03:02:52,375
[SPEAKER_18]: Roll call has been requested.

2575
03:02:52,395 --> 03:02:54,496
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Clerk.

2576
03:02:56,077 --> 03:02:56,937
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Camuso.

2577
03:02:57,937 --> 03:02:58,777
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Caraviello.

2578
03:02:58,857 --> 03:02:59,037
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

2579
03:02:59,858 --> 03:03:00,418
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Knight.

2580
03:03:00,678 --> 03:03:00,858
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

2581
03:03:01,759 --> 03:03:02,719
[SPEAKER_19]: Vice President Lionel Kern.

2582
03:03:02,739 --> 03:03:02,859
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

2583
03:03:03,799 --> 03:03:04,380
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Marks.

2584
03:03:04,660 --> 03:03:04,940
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

2585
03:03:05,340 --> 03:03:05,940
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Panetta.

2586
03:03:05,960 --> 03:03:06,160
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

2587
03:03:06,961 --> 03:03:07,721
[SPEAKER_19]: President Dello Russo.

2588
03:03:08,241 --> 03:03:08,621
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

2589
03:03:09,602 --> 03:03:14,124
[SPEAKER_18]: On the vote of six in the affirmative, one absent, the motion passes.

2590
03:03:15,324 --> 03:03:20,446
[SPEAKER_18]: The records of the tabled records of the December 16th, 2014

2591
03:03:22,760 --> 03:03:25,242
[SPEAKER_18]: meeting were passed to Councilor Knight for review.

2592
03:03:25,583 --> 03:03:27,224
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor, how did you find those records?

2593
03:03:27,324 --> 03:03:28,505
[SPEAKER_18]: I move for approval, Mr. President.

2594
03:03:28,765 --> 03:03:31,227
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion to approve by Councilor Knight.

2595
03:03:31,267 --> 03:03:32,148
[SPEAKER_18]: All those in favour?

2596
03:03:32,188 --> 03:03:33,029
[SPEAKER_18]: All those opposed?

2597
03:03:35,651 --> 03:03:36,492
[SPEAKER_18]: Records accepted.

2598
03:03:37,293 --> 03:03:41,156
[SPEAKER_18]: Records of January 13, 2015 passed to Councilor Fanta.

2599
03:03:41,476 --> 03:03:43,118
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor, how did you find those records?

2600
03:03:43,238 --> 03:03:43,678
[SPEAKER_18]: Accepted.

2601
03:03:44,559 --> 03:03:45,380
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion to accept?

2602
03:03:45,460 --> 03:03:45,600
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

2603
03:03:45,740 --> 03:03:46,541
[SPEAKER_18]: All those in favour?

2604
03:03:46,561 --> 03:03:47,442
[SPEAKER_18]: All those opposed?

2605
03:03:50,277 --> 03:03:53,560
[SPEAKER_18]: Before we adjourn, Councilor Marks will briefly address the council.

2606
03:03:53,620 --> 03:03:54,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Just one brief thing, Mr. President.

2607
03:03:55,001 --> 03:04:05,569
[SPEAKER_03]: I had the opportunity to attend the Martin Luther King third annual event, which was held yesterday at the West Medford Community Center.

2608
03:04:06,590 --> 03:04:10,032
[SPEAKER_03]: There had to be close to a hundred people that attended.

2609
03:04:11,373 --> 03:04:17,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Part of the program dealt with Medford High students along with their teacher, whose name escapes me right now,

2610
03:04:18,248 --> 03:04:24,389
[SPEAKER_03]: students that shared very touching stories of intolerance.

2611
03:04:25,310 --> 03:04:28,210
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was roughly 13 students.

2612
03:04:28,850 --> 03:04:41,513
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was a real eye-opener, Mr. President, which really played in part of what took part in the whole civil rights process with Martin Luther King and so forth.

2613
03:04:42,225 --> 03:04:45,246
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was a great event.

2614

[SPEAKER_03]: And I look forward to next year's event.

2616
03:04:54,989 --> 03:05:07,134
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to personally thank each and every student that came up there to share such a personal story, some of which you may want to keep secret.

2617
03:05:07,174 --> 03:05:10,355
[SPEAKER_03]: But these students were willing to get up there and show that

2618
03:05:11,897 --> 03:05:25,903
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, what their experience has been and, uh, how they, uh, improving and also how, uh, the city of method in many circumstances has united around, uh, these particular students, uh, to include them.

2619
03:05:26,603 --> 03:05:27,964
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, it was very touching.

2620
03:05:28,364 --> 03:05:33,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and, um, again, I look forward to attending the event next year.
