1
00:00:03,575 --> 00:00:03,995
[SPEAKER_10]: There we are.

2
00:00:04,035 --> 00:00:17,346
[SPEAKER_10]: So I will, again, I'll just reintroduce this, which is, this is a project for 100 Winchester Street, and this is the neighborhood meeting relative to the proposed 65-unit residential building.

3
00:00:17,986 --> 00:00:23,591
[SPEAKER_10]: With that, I'm gonna pass it over to Peter Quinn to walk through the design.

4
00:00:25,812 --> 00:00:26,993
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, thanks, Adam.

5
00:00:27,053 --> 00:00:30,636
[SPEAKER_11]: My name is Peter Quinn of Peter Quinn Architects right in Davis Square.

6
00:00:33,798 --> 00:00:37,200
[SPEAKER_11]: Adam, somebody had just mentioned in the chat.

7
00:00:39,001 --> 00:00:48,405
[SPEAKER_11]: If we could just explain a little more about the new ordinance, how it relates to this particular project I think that might be a good frame to talk about.

8
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:49,706
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, sure.

9
00:00:49,746 --> 00:00:52,467
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I can certainly talk through it.

10
00:00:53,305 --> 00:00:57,928
[SPEAKER_10]: Victor, I know, and his team have been working through that process.

11
00:00:57,968 --> 00:01:00,210
[SPEAKER_10]: I know Alicia Hunt is now on the line as well.

12
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:07,675
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm happy to talk about it too, but Victor, Alicia, do you want to tell, explain anything about kind of how the process works from the city side?

13
00:01:10,271 --> 00:01:10,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thank you.

14
00:01:10,952 --> 00:01:12,032
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd be happy to jump in.

15
00:01:12,052 --> 00:01:16,135
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Victor Schrader, I'm the City of Medford's Director of Economic Development.

16
00:01:17,116 --> 00:01:28,864
[SPEAKER_05]: This past year, City Council approved a number of changes to Medford's zoning ordinance, and included in those changes was the creation of what we call a planned development district.

17
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:33,508
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be referred to as a PDD for short in some cases.

18
00:01:35,494 --> 00:01:49,906
[SPEAKER_05]: These districts allow a project similar to this to create a zoning called an overlay to allow the project specifics that they're looking for.

19
00:01:50,106 --> 00:01:53,689
[SPEAKER_05]: So typically a project would come to the city

20
00:01:54,690 --> 00:02:03,199
[SPEAKER_05]: requesting what we call relief or variances for certain changes to height or density or parking.

21
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:16,132
[SPEAKER_05]: In this case, the proponent will submit the project through the community development board, our planning board for review and city council for review.

22
00:02:17,373 --> 00:02:22,174
[SPEAKER_05]: of the specific zoning district for this project.

23
00:02:22,975 --> 00:02:41,720
[SPEAKER_05]: If that zoning district is approved, then the project can continue through to site plan review, which means that they'll go back before the Community Development Board for review of things like landscaping and design and traffic.

24
00:02:42,921 --> 00:02:46,404
[SPEAKER_05]: those items that Adam mentioned earlier in the presentation.

25
00:02:46,464 --> 00:02:49,266
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is a little bit different process for Medford.

26
00:02:49,346 --> 00:02:59,255
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a couple of additional steps which means there's more opportunity for input by the public but essentially it's a custom zoning district for a project.

27
00:03:00,536 --> 00:03:06,562
[SPEAKER_07]: Well so assuming that by law you don't have to notify any of the neighbors when you're changing the zoning.

28
00:03:10,276 --> 00:03:16,239
[SPEAKER_05]: Neighbors were notified for this particular project, do you mean?

29
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:25,843
[SPEAKER_07]: Changing the zoning or creating these special zoning districts, one would have to be sort of tracking the zoning board or the city to know that these things are happening, right?

30
00:03:25,884 --> 00:03:28,745
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not going to alert the neighbors that you're changing the zoning in their neighborhood.

31
00:03:29,636 --> 00:03:29,976
[SPEAKER_05]: We will.

32
00:03:30,016 --> 00:03:45,583
[SPEAKER_05]: There will be public notice requirements for the Community Development Board public hearing, and for the City Council public hearing, and then again for the site plan review process with Community Development Board.

33
00:03:45,663 --> 00:03:56,187
[SPEAKER_07]: It's confusing because you made it sound like past tense, like the past year Medford has undertaken creating new zoning areas, but I don't remember getting notification of that.

34
00:03:57,927 --> 00:04:03,109
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, that was to change the zoning ordinance to allow for this process.

35
00:04:03,149 --> 00:04:13,214
[SPEAKER_05]: And then moving forward, as these planned development districts are proposed, there'll be additional notification for the public hearings for each specific project.

36
00:04:13,234 --> 00:04:14,834
[SPEAKER_05]: I apologize, that wasn't clear.

37
00:04:16,295 --> 00:04:19,497
[SPEAKER_11]: I should also add, we have not made any formal application yet.

38
00:04:19,597 --> 00:04:23,878
[SPEAKER_11]: So all those public notices are not in process yet.

39
00:04:24,719 --> 00:04:25,359
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.

40
00:04:25,619 --> 00:04:27,120
[SPEAKER_07]: And the PDDs, that's what you're calling them?

41
00:04:29,065 --> 00:04:37,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's the zoning term for the plan development districts, which is kind of the process for proposing.

42
00:04:37,698 --> 00:04:41,665
[SPEAKER_07]: So, so our neighborhood now has a PDD in it.

43
00:04:45,832 --> 00:04:46,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope, not yet.

44
00:04:47,213 --> 00:04:52,937
[SPEAKER_05]: It's allowed for in Medford generally, but we don't have any in the city at this point.

45
00:04:53,358 --> 00:05:05,667
[SPEAKER_05]: So this would be the first project that's proposed under the new order if the proponent decides to apply, which as Peter just said, they haven't.

46
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,311
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so I'll introduce the site first.

47
00:05:16,451 --> 00:05:31,495
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure a lot of people know the site very well, but I know this is a potentially citywide broadcast this evening with people from outside the neighborhood, so I think it's a good idea to talk a little bit about the site itself and all of its complexities.

48
00:05:32,136 --> 00:05:38,738
[SPEAKER_11]: As you can see in this picture here, if you can see my screen, it's a big L-shaped lot.

49
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:39,898
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the tan area.

50
00:05:40,947 --> 00:05:45,429
[SPEAKER_11]: And Winchester Street is a vertical street here on the left where my cursor is.

51
00:05:46,049 --> 00:05:51,371
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we have Albion Street, which runs along another side.

52
00:05:51,691 --> 00:05:56,513
[SPEAKER_11]: And then there's actually frontage on a third street, which is Alfred Street.

53
00:05:56,533 --> 00:05:58,354
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's quite a large lot.

54
00:05:58,394 --> 00:06:00,054
[SPEAKER_11]: It's almost 50,000 square feet.

55
00:06:00,274 --> 00:06:05,496
[SPEAKER_11]: Kind of unusual to have such a large lot in a fairly dense area.

56
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:09,240
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, it's been that way for many years.

57
00:06:10,982 --> 00:06:23,230
[SPEAKER_11]: It also has quite a bit of slope in it, if you go from the high point out here in the corner of Albion and Winchester to the low point at the low end of Alfred.

58
00:06:23,953 --> 00:06:25,635
[SPEAKER_11]: It's over 14 feet of drop.

59
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:36,751
[SPEAKER_11]: So you can imagine it's like a story and a half of building, even across the site from Winchester to Alfred is a

60
00:06:41,108 --> 00:06:42,649
[SPEAKER_11]: is also about six or seven feet.

61
00:06:42,849 --> 00:06:53,632
[SPEAKER_11]: So there are a lot of grades to deal with here and to try to get the building to fit into the site without it becoming overwhelmingly large.

62
00:06:55,253 --> 00:07:01,855
[SPEAKER_11]: So with that in mind, we have come up with a site plan that does a number of things.

63
00:07:02,135 --> 00:07:05,256
[SPEAKER_11]: First of all, this is just a diagrammatic site plan.

64
00:07:05,276 --> 00:07:08,177
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll get into the landscape in a few minutes.

65
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:17,960
[SPEAKER_11]: with our landscape architect to explain, you know, how the green systems work around the yard, around the building.

66
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:24,302
[SPEAKER_11]: But the building is essentially two buildings fused together.

67
00:07:24,382 --> 00:07:27,023
[SPEAKER_11]: We have the Winchester building, which is out toward Winchester.

68
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:34,623
[SPEAKER_11]: is because they're at different heights.

69
00:07:36,064 --> 00:07:48,026
[SPEAKER_11]: Not only the roof height, but also just the way they are stepped on the site in order to adjust to those grades that I mentioned just a few minutes ago.

70
00:07:48,946 --> 00:07:54,867
[SPEAKER_11]: To orient you on the site a little bit, I'm just going to show you some existing condition photos.

71
00:07:55,527 --> 00:07:59,828
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is the corner of the property on Winchester before you get to the

72
00:08:01,803 --> 00:08:03,184
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll be in order.

73
00:08:03,404 --> 00:08:06,766
[SPEAKER_11]: So, our first existing bills here, you take them down.

74
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:23,077
[SPEAKER_11]: We have an employer over here with a big driver runs a masonry business there and then these are these, this is a view into the site itself, where we have a distant one of the existing building.

75
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:34,017
[SPEAKER_11]: then looking directly into the site, which is mostly parking lot right now, and buildings.

76
00:08:34,717 --> 00:08:42,663
[SPEAKER_11]: And then you can see this historic corner building, which we hope to restore to a limited extent and to expand on.

77
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:48,727
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a good corner shot showing you from- Is that your stack?

78
00:08:49,728 --> 00:08:52,670
[SPEAKER_11]: Alveon coming in from the right and Winchester from the left.

79
00:08:56,921 --> 00:09:06,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Peter, I don't mean to interrupt you, but would it be helpful if you made one of the city staff co-hosts so we can manage muting?

80
00:09:06,702 --> 00:09:10,923
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think, Adam, you made Peter the host.

81
00:09:12,143 --> 00:09:15,584
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I don't think I can handle talking in.

82
00:09:16,584 --> 00:09:20,625
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, just as folks are coming and going in the room, it's helpful to have folks like that.

83
00:09:25,595 --> 00:09:25,795
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

84
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:34,219
[SPEAKER_11]: And as we go around Albion Street, you can see the house that I just mentioned, the existing house.

85
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,902
[SPEAKER_11]: And then Albion itself is two and a half story, mostly two and a half story buildings.

86
00:09:40,702 --> 00:09:45,465
[SPEAKER_11]: And then on Alfred, this is actually the site right here.

87
00:09:47,895 --> 00:09:54,222
[SPEAKER_11]: where it has a little bit of pre-growth and some shrubs, and then just beyond that is a parking lot that I mentioned before.

88
00:09:54,262 --> 00:09:59,247
[SPEAKER_11]: You can see how this site slopes here quite a bit along that.

89
00:09:59,287 --> 00:10:01,769
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the orientation I'll get into.

90
00:10:04,179 --> 00:10:19,528
[SPEAKER_11]: So in addition to our step building responding to the higher Winchester side and the lower Alfred side, we've introduced a driveway ramp on Winchester Street that's wide enough for traffic in two directions.

91
00:10:20,168 --> 00:10:23,530
[SPEAKER_11]: And this will go into an underground garage that's built into the hillside.

92
00:10:25,531 --> 00:10:33,115
[SPEAKER_11]: And then that garage provides a platform that allows us to build the building on top of it.

93
00:10:34,295 --> 00:10:35,616
[SPEAKER_11]: There are actually two garages.

94
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:42,678
[SPEAKER_11]: There's an upper garage, which is on the Winchester side, and then a lower garage, which is on the Alfred side.

95
00:10:43,338 --> 00:10:46,740
[SPEAKER_11]: They actually are about, you know, almost a story apart.

96
00:10:48,941 --> 00:11:03,286
[SPEAKER_11]: And at the corner where we have the existing blue building, we're proposing to take off the rear part of that building and build a new alley that would house the potential commercial

97
00:11:05,867 --> 00:11:20,290
[SPEAKER_11]: at the corner and save that existing tree, which is really quite beautiful, and do some other things with landscaping that Katya will explain from our landscape architect in a few minutes.

98
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:26,591
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's a complicated site, but I think we managed to get some good order to it.

99
00:11:26,911 --> 00:11:33,512
[SPEAKER_11]: There are sidewalks that allow access for emergency and the like on all sides.

100
00:11:34,187 --> 00:11:38,750
[SPEAKER_11]: We also do have a ramp coming in from Alfred, but this is exclusively for emergency use only.

101
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:43,273
[SPEAKER_11]: The fire chief will want to be able to get to one whole side of the building.

102
00:11:43,813 --> 00:11:50,958
[SPEAKER_11]: So these will actually be grass pavers, and we'll try to blend it into the landscape as best we can.

103
00:11:51,819 --> 00:11:58,303
[SPEAKER_11]: But there'll be a breakaway gable bollards here that will prevent any traffic coming out onto Alfred.

104
00:11:59,044 --> 00:12:03,548
[SPEAKER_11]: So all the traffic will exclusively into the Winchester Street.

105
00:12:04,388 --> 00:12:13,956
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's plenty of room for cars to pull in and out and have waiting space while traffic is going by.

106
00:12:13,976 --> 00:12:21,363
[SPEAKER_11]: Now I'm going to show you some 3D views that we've created.

107
00:12:21,403 --> 00:12:23,464
[SPEAKER_11]: This view I've seen on my first sheet.

108
00:12:23,825 --> 00:12:26,487
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a view of the existing

109
00:12:32,978 --> 00:12:33,798
[SPEAKER_11]: in the front.

110
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:45,322
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the L edition that I mentioned on the rear, the tree's actually much bigger than what's shown here, but you get the idea.

111
00:12:46,902 --> 00:12:52,484
[SPEAKER_11]: There's also potential for a small parklet at the corner that would be perfectly accessible.

112
00:12:52,504 --> 00:12:55,545
[SPEAKER_11]: Fatsia will show you that in a few minutes.

113
00:12:56,345 --> 00:13:01,527
[SPEAKER_11]: In addition to that, there's space between this existing building and then our new building.

114
00:13:02,193 --> 00:13:05,275
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can see that we try to break the mass of this building.

115
00:13:05,355 --> 00:13:13,821
[SPEAKER_11]: It is four stories, but it's done in such a way that the main body of it is three stories.

116
00:13:13,921 --> 00:13:18,525
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we step back to create the fourth story right here and use a different color.

117
00:13:18,545 --> 00:13:22,848
[SPEAKER_11]: And it really helps to break the mass of the building up a lot.

118
00:13:24,349 --> 00:13:26,250
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a view, aerial view looking down.

119
00:13:29,663 --> 00:13:33,366
[SPEAKER_11]: at that same, approximately the same location.

120
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:44,375
[SPEAKER_11]: You can see the existing building with the L in the back, commercial use, and then the proposed building on the Winchester end.

121
00:13:44,776 --> 00:13:50,300
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can just see here, it's starting to show how the building steps down at the Alfred Street side.

122
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,642
[SPEAKER_11]: The Alfred Street side is only three stories.

123
00:14:00,855 --> 00:14:03,377
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a view looking into that ramp that I mentioned.

124
00:14:03,437 --> 00:14:07,580
[SPEAKER_11]: You can see how there are multiple levels, two levels to the garage.

125
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:08,681
[SPEAKER_11]: It's further down.

126
00:14:09,521 --> 00:14:18,808
[SPEAKER_11]: It follows the site as the grade recedes and lowers it to alpha.

127
00:14:19,489 --> 00:14:23,291
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, three stories and then the fourth story setback.

128
00:14:23,691 --> 00:14:25,773
[SPEAKER_11]: This, what you see here is a stair tower.

129
00:14:31,755 --> 00:14:35,879
[SPEAKER_11]: And second, this is an aerial view of that same shot.

130
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:43,805
[SPEAKER_11]: And as you can see on the roof, we're embracing quite a bit of solar area.

131
00:14:44,386 --> 00:14:48,889
[SPEAKER_11]: There'll probably be more than what's shown here once we have a better handle on mechanical systems.

132
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:55,335
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can also see how things are stepping down as we go toward Alpha.

133
00:14:58,678 --> 00:15:00,399
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a view from Alfred Street.

134
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,802
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a simpler version of the facade.

135
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:04,103
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no entry here.

136
00:15:04,743 --> 00:15:07,666
[SPEAKER_11]: There is an egress coming out of the basement on the left-hand side here.

137
00:15:08,046 --> 00:15:17,174
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is this breakaway gate or fire gate that I mentioned before with the grass pavers that would allow a fire truck to get in there.

138
00:15:20,877 --> 00:15:22,058
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an aerial view.

139
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:31,494
[SPEAKER_11]: looking down onto the building, and you can see how the Winchester Street side is higher when it steps down.

140
00:15:31,934 --> 00:15:35,276
[SPEAKER_11]: We're still, we're having a little bit of force.

141
00:15:36,417 --> 00:15:37,037
[SPEAKER_11]: Poor story.

142
00:15:37,177 --> 00:15:38,038
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, now we can.

143
00:15:38,198 --> 00:15:38,538
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

144
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,180
[SPEAKER_11]: Can somebody mute their line, please?

145
00:15:55,294 --> 00:15:55,854
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Peter.

146
00:15:56,115 --> 00:15:57,736
[SPEAKER_10]: Peter, can I just interrupt you for a moment?

147
00:15:57,756 --> 00:16:01,438
[SPEAKER_10]: I think now that you are the host, do you have the ability to mute?

148
00:16:05,801 --> 00:16:09,683
[SPEAKER_10]: Peter, you do have the ability to, now that you're the host, to mute all others?

149
00:16:10,044 --> 00:16:20,390
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sharing the screen, but I don't think I'm, you know, I'm going to see if I can reclaim myself as the host.

150
00:16:20,811 --> 00:16:21,831
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you hold one minute?

151
00:16:21,951 --> 00:16:22,832
[SPEAKER_10]: One minute, please.

152
00:16:22,932 --> 00:16:23,653
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll call you right back.

153
00:16:27,008 --> 00:16:27,588
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, are you there?

154
00:16:29,109 --> 00:16:29,349
[SPEAKER_10]: Carol?

155
00:16:29,849 --> 00:16:31,630
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Edelman, can you mute your line, please?

156
00:16:33,231 --> 00:16:35,352
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, I'm gonna mute everybody here.

157
00:16:37,953 --> 00:16:39,253
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry about this, everybody.

158
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:45,176
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

159
00:16:47,697 --> 00:16:48,237
[SPEAKER_10]: One moment.

160
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:08,659
[SPEAKER_10]: So Victor, I'm trying to make you a co-host, but it looks like I can only make one person a host at a time.

161
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:13,944
[SPEAKER_10]: So now that everyone's muted, I might pass it back to Peter for now.

162
00:17:14,224 --> 00:17:16,085
[SPEAKER_10]: Peter, you can finish up your presentation.

163
00:17:17,426 --> 00:17:18,768
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll just take it one step at a time.

164
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:21,650
[SPEAKER_10]: You can hear me OK?

165
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:22,791
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't been muted?

166
00:17:22,971 --> 00:17:23,251
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

167
00:17:24,012 --> 00:17:24,212
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

168
00:17:24,232 --> 00:17:30,577
[SPEAKER_11]: So an aerial view from Alfred, you can see we have quite a bit of landscaping along

169
00:17:31,988 --> 00:17:34,371
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think you're going to need to re-share your screen.

170
00:17:34,831 --> 00:17:42,921
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's give that a second to come up.

171
00:17:45,084 --> 00:17:45,985
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, great.

172
00:17:48,481 --> 00:17:54,444
[SPEAKER_11]: So you can see we've started to develop a little bit of landscaping along Alfred, create a park-like condition there.

173
00:17:56,165 --> 00:17:59,447
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, I'll show you that in more detail in a few minutes.

174
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:06,431
[SPEAKER_11]: And from the other corner, also on Alfred, from the left-hand side, similar type of view.

175
00:18:06,731 --> 00:18:14,836
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see how the building stepped down very logically from on the grids.

176
00:18:16,036 --> 00:18:17,197
[SPEAKER_11]: That's an aerial view of the same.

177
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:22,751
[SPEAKER_11]: Most of the units have small outdoor decks or patios of one kind or another.

178
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:26,972
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's a nice living arrangement for most people.

179
00:18:28,652 --> 00:18:33,053
[SPEAKER_11]: Getting into the buildings a little bit, this is a typical one of the two garages.

180
00:18:33,133 --> 00:18:35,274
[SPEAKER_11]: Both have about 25 parking spaces each.

181
00:18:36,214 --> 00:18:46,796
[SPEAKER_11]: And between them, between the upper garage and the lower garage, here's the upper garage, there are elevators and bike storage and trash areas and that kind of thing.

182
00:18:48,207 --> 00:18:49,688
[SPEAKER_11]: All of that's contained within the building.

183
00:18:50,789 --> 00:18:54,951
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the units themselves are all one and two bedroom units throughout the building.

184
00:18:56,472 --> 00:18:58,894
[SPEAKER_11]: No studios, per se.

185
00:18:59,774 --> 00:19:02,116
[SPEAKER_11]: Some small one bedrooms, but no studios.

186
00:19:03,356 --> 00:19:06,298
[SPEAKER_11]: And these are the four plans.

187
00:19:06,318 --> 00:19:09,580
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, we'll be able to show those in more detail later on.

188
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,923
[SPEAKER_11]: There's some nice amenities, such as a living room for the whole building that looks out into Winchester Street.

189
00:19:15,475 --> 00:19:24,018
[SPEAKER_11]: and then there's the roof deck that you might have seen here as for the residents up on the roof.

190
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:35,083
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, that's very sheltered and inbound of the edges of the building quite a bit so that it's not intrusive to the neighborhood.

191
00:19:36,263 --> 00:19:37,083
[SPEAKER_11]: Just a couple more things.

192
00:19:47,999 --> 00:19:58,548
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to send it over to you, and why don't you just tell me what you want me to bring up.

193
00:19:58,568 --> 00:20:00,930
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a landscape plan.

194
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:01,710
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Katja.

195
00:20:02,531 --> 00:20:03,252
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, hi.

196
00:20:03,552 --> 00:20:04,192
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Peter.

197
00:20:05,654 --> 00:20:07,375
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Katja Pasablo.

198
00:20:07,695 --> 00:20:09,717
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm principal at Verdant Landscape Architecture.

199
00:20:09,737 --> 00:20:13,040
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to walk you through our proposed landscape design.

200
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,942
[SPEAKER_09]: I have four or five slides maybe to share.

201
00:20:16,042 --> 00:20:16,502
[SPEAKER_09]: This is our

202
00:20:17,343 --> 00:20:23,129
[SPEAKER_09]: one overall landscape plan that will kind of dwell on for a little while and then Peter I'll let you know when I want you to go to the next slide.

203
00:20:23,149 --> 00:20:26,612
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to try to be brief so we can get to your questions.

204
00:20:27,953 --> 00:20:37,943
[SPEAKER_09]: So the way I wanted to present this landscape is to talk about pretty basically first the landscape component that supports residential use around the larger

205
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:44,368
[SPEAKER_09]: portion of the larger building to the north of the site there, the larger sized piece to the north.

206
00:20:44,528 --> 00:20:56,858
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I'll focus on the area around the little historic house and the landscape around that zone and the little public pocket park that we've designed on the corner of Albion and Winchester Street.

207
00:20:57,778 --> 00:21:04,784
[SPEAKER_09]: So to begin, how is the landscape designed around and supporting residential use around this residential building?

208
00:21:06,778 --> 00:21:10,979
[SPEAKER_09]: As Peter already described, I'll try not to repeat too much here.

209
00:21:11,699 --> 00:21:17,721
[SPEAKER_09]: The building is designed with these sort of like two faces, one that's facing Winchester Street and one that's facing Alfred Street.

210
00:21:17,741 --> 00:21:21,482
[SPEAKER_09]: So you could imagine there could potentially be lots of coming and going from both ends.

211
00:21:21,562 --> 00:21:27,943
[SPEAKER_09]: But in fact, the Winchester Street side has the primary main front door for the whole entire building.

212
00:21:28,023 --> 00:21:34,405
[SPEAKER_09]: It also, as Peter described, has the main driveway entry and exit for all the cars coming and going

213
00:21:35,725 --> 00:21:47,230
[SPEAKER_09]: garages which are below you know in the basement level which is really nice because as you can see there's not any parking on site you can't see any cars sitting around on the site they're all concealed below in the basement which is great.

214
00:21:48,821 --> 00:21:53,383
[SPEAKER_09]: So like I said, on the Winchester side, we have the front door and the driveway down to the basement.

215
00:21:54,183 --> 00:21:58,805
[SPEAKER_09]: And that side is treated like the public side with slightly more formal plantings.

216
00:21:59,005 --> 00:22:05,628
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can see some symmetry on that left-hand side in front of the building in the planting design in the front yard.

217
00:22:05,648 --> 00:22:11,931
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course you have a set of front steps going to the front door, centrally located on that facade of the building.

218
00:22:11,951 --> 00:22:16,292
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they're flanked by plantings that are somewhat mirrored on both sides, more or less.

219
00:22:16,312 --> 00:22:17,093
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's more formal.

220
00:22:18,265 --> 00:22:25,537
[SPEAKER_09]: It's also open there isn't any fencing around the front that's feeling very welcoming as far as getting to the front door for mail delivery or that kind of thing visitors.

221
00:22:26,518 --> 00:22:32,668
[SPEAKER_09]: There's also an accessible route around the right hand side to the front door if you're in a wheelchair so of course there's accessibility.

222
00:22:33,817 --> 00:22:53,360
[SPEAKER_09]: And then on the other end of the building on the Alfred Street side we designed a much quieter yard area that's more natural in its composition so there are Peter showed some existing condition photos of existing trees along that property line and we're proposing to thin them out a little bit and give the nicer ones, a better chance at having some.

223
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,601
[SPEAKER_09]: enough sunlight to thrive.

224
00:22:56,241 --> 00:23:05,986
[SPEAKER_09]: And then under planting them with a lot more kind of woodland style plants and understory small trees and shrubs, no lawn spaces here.

225
00:23:06,066 --> 00:23:07,827
[SPEAKER_09]: So trying to create like a woodland setting.

226
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:13,150
[SPEAKER_09]: You can see them, you know, if you were to zoom in and there are going to be a couple enlargements, we can do more zooming in later.

227
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:18,813
[SPEAKER_09]: But you can see we're showing some stepping stones through this area and a little bench, a place to sit down.

228
00:23:19,334 --> 00:23:32,101
[SPEAKER_09]: So residents who live here can have a really nice wooded green space to enjoy as part of the entire landscape experience, in addition to those patios that Peter mentioned.

229
00:23:32,762 --> 00:23:40,867
[SPEAKER_09]: And at the same time, we're maintaining some nice overstory trees that can help create a sense of scale to the proposed new building.

230
00:23:43,952 --> 00:23:48,014
[SPEAKER_09]: The access into the driveway on this side is only allowed for fire trucks.

231
00:23:48,034 --> 00:23:49,034
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a breakaway gate.

232
00:23:49,114 --> 00:23:52,796
[SPEAKER_09]: So if there were an emergency, only the fire department can unlock that.

233
00:23:52,816 --> 00:24:01,459
[SPEAKER_09]: And it would otherwise look sort of like lawn with a special kind of paving system that is structured so that a fire truck can drive on it.

234
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:05,041
[SPEAKER_09]: But it otherwise would need to get mowed and plowed for the fire trucks.

235
00:24:05,121 --> 00:24:09,883
[SPEAKER_09]: But its overall view is more green than it is pavement.

236
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:14,913
[SPEAKER_09]: It's also permeable, so that's a good benefit of that kind of paving system.

237
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:19,431
[SPEAKER_09]: And we are proposing a little fence around that right side.

238
00:24:19,451 --> 00:24:24,913
[SPEAKER_09]: And you'll see an image of the kind of picket fence we're proposing, but a little more open in character.

239
00:24:24,973 --> 00:24:34,596
[SPEAKER_09]: So it feels a little bit more, it's not as like concealed behind like a six foot height wood fence, which we're doing at other private property lines where we want more privacy.

240
00:24:34,636 --> 00:24:40,398
[SPEAKER_09]: But on that right hand side, trying to create a little bit more air circulation and light into that woodland area.

241
00:24:40,418 --> 00:24:44,659
[SPEAKER_09]: So it feels a little bit, not as mysterious behind a dark wall or anything.

242
00:24:46,572 --> 00:24:52,856
[SPEAKER_09]: And then one last note is that the walkway areas that go into the residential zone from this side would all be FOB entry only.

243
00:24:52,956 --> 00:25:01,781
[SPEAKER_09]: So people who live here would be able to unlock them with their FOB, but in general, other people who don't live here wouldn't have those keys, so they wouldn't be able to get through.

244
00:25:02,521 --> 00:25:11,026
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's a matter of trying to maintain security on the premises and eliminate people from trying to use this as a cut through for security purposes in the neighborhood.

245
00:25:12,647 --> 00:25:27,173
[SPEAKER_09]: And then zoom out just a little bit more along the north and the south sides of the building, Peter already showed and I'll just reiterate that there are a number of terraces and patio shown, which provide the units that above them to have their own private patio or deck space.

246
00:25:28,094 --> 00:25:30,035
[SPEAKER_09]: There's some terraces along the northwest edge.

247
00:25:31,315 --> 00:25:37,918
[SPEAKER_09]: north side of the building along the western half and then also on the southeast side that are actually built above the garage.

248
00:25:38,098 --> 00:25:44,921
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't have big garden areas, but instead they'll be more like porches or decks where people can add planters and some patio furniture and that sort of thing.

249
00:25:45,635 --> 00:25:53,202
[SPEAKER_09]: Then you do see that there are some patios along the south edge of the building on the west side mainly that would be on-grade patios.

250
00:25:53,322 --> 00:26:10,418
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you can see a lot of green spaces that we've planted up with lots of trees and shrubs to help create a really pleasant green backdrop for each of those private patio areas, as well as to help buffer between our project and then the residential uses that are to the south of our site.

251
00:26:12,284 --> 00:26:24,668
[SPEAKER_09]: Something to note our property line is actually a little ways away from the fence line that you see depicted in our drawing here, there's a right of way that passes through the backyards of the residences.

252
00:26:25,728 --> 00:26:28,089
[SPEAKER_09]: But as a matter of, you know, it's not like we're going to.

253
00:26:29,189 --> 00:26:44,135
[SPEAKER_09]: program that in any way, but because a building is coming down along the edge of where a new fence line will be replacing that building wall with a six foot height wood board fence to create the privacy that will be lost when that existing building is removed.

254
00:26:44,916 --> 00:26:53,660
[SPEAKER_09]: So have no fear, people who live in these houses, maybe some of you were on tonight, there will be a privacy line maintained along that edge.

255
00:26:57,044 --> 00:27:00,187
[SPEAKER_09]: So now let's look at the landscape around the blue house on the corner.

256
00:27:00,748 --> 00:27:03,691
[SPEAKER_09]: As Peter described, we're maintaining the historic core.

257
00:27:04,323 --> 00:27:08,987
[SPEAKER_09]: of the building architecture, which is along the top part of that area.

258
00:27:09,567 --> 00:27:16,713
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we're gonna protect also there's an existing shade tree that's located just to the south of the house, the green circle.

259
00:27:17,513 --> 00:27:30,023
[SPEAKER_09]: So once the addition, it's also in blue, along the right is added, there's gonna be this nice central shaded courtyard area that's formed by that new L-shaped building with the central focal point of a tree.

260
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:41,793
[SPEAKER_09]: And in order to keep that patio area more or less level, because as Peter said, there's a lot of slope on this site, we're proposing a small retaining wall along the left edge of that patio space.

261
00:27:42,413 --> 00:27:45,114
[SPEAKER_09]: So that patio would then step down a couple of feet.

262
00:27:45,134 --> 00:27:49,275
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not a very big wall, but to keep that area nice and flat, we needed a little wall.

263
00:27:49,735 --> 00:27:58,258
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it steps down to that little, that pocket park zone that you can see on the bottom left there at the corner of Winchester and Albion

264
00:27:59,447 --> 00:28:05,531
[SPEAKER_09]: The front door to the house will be maintained off Winchester, straight up to the front of the house.

265
00:28:06,191 --> 00:28:17,558
[SPEAKER_09]: And then an accessible route from the Albion Street sidewalk has been developed from the southeast corner of this portion of the site up into the patio area, so there'll be accessibility as well.

266
00:28:18,139 --> 00:28:18,939
[SPEAKER_09]: There's also a couple of

267
00:28:20,459 --> 00:28:26,422
[SPEAKER_09]: egress doors along the right side of the building that will need to be included.

268
00:28:26,482 --> 00:28:35,366
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's a walkway that goes around that edge, but we're providing a lot of buffer plantings along that edge as well for privacy between the existing residences to our east.

269
00:28:36,706 --> 00:28:40,468
[SPEAKER_09]: So the final piece of this area is the proposed pocket park that you can see in the bottom left.

270
00:28:41,432 --> 00:28:42,894
[SPEAKER_09]: at the corner of Winchester and Albion.

271
00:28:43,374 --> 00:28:52,384
[SPEAKER_09]: So originally we thought we might be able to create like a little semi circular shortcut with some benches along the edge of this little path that cut the corner.

272
00:28:53,084 --> 00:29:01,193
[SPEAKER_09]: But based on some comments we heard from the community and also because of some grading issues, we decided to cut off the ability to take that shortcut.

273
00:29:01,553 --> 00:29:09,697
[SPEAKER_09]: Instead, we're developing this little green seating area that's more or less surrounded by nice green plant beds and some new trees and shrubs and things.

274
00:29:10,197 --> 00:29:12,698
[SPEAKER_09]: And you also have this little backdrop of that little retaining wall.

275
00:29:13,378 --> 00:29:20,881
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you're sitting on one of these benches, you might get a nice view of the intersection where there's been a lot of other nice crosswalk and curbing and plant bed improvements.

276
00:29:21,522 --> 00:29:23,522
[SPEAKER_09]: As well, you could probably see across to Broadway, of course.

277
00:29:25,604 --> 00:29:31,249
[SPEAKER_09]: So the other enlargements that preceded this page, if you wanted to, I don't know if it's worth it, we've already kind of looked at them.

278
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:35,953
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the space along Alfred Street showing some of the materials that are being proposed.

279
00:29:35,994 --> 00:29:39,196
[SPEAKER_09]: The upper right is that checker block paving that's the fire lane paving.

280
00:29:39,817 --> 00:29:41,979
[SPEAKER_09]: So it does have some pavement to it, but it's mostly green.

281
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,142
[SPEAKER_09]: The style of bench we're proposing and then some

282
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:55,327
[SPEAKER_09]: more friendly, slightly lower fences for this pocket, not pocket park, but like green space area around the edges to privatize it, but allow for views in and out, because it'll be quite pretty.

283
00:29:55,687 --> 00:30:00,409
[SPEAKER_09]: Some stepping stones to get through, a little more naturalistic in its composition, like I mentioned.

284
00:30:00,669 --> 00:30:12,795
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the previous enlargement shows the front at Winchester, which zooms in and shows a little bit more about the planting and materials at the front of the house or the building, which, you know, some unit paving at the front steps or front entry walkway.

285
00:30:13,755 --> 00:30:24,278
[SPEAKER_09]: And the style of, you know, basic basic six foot height would board fence being proposed at our butters to the north, as well as to the south where we have residential butters.

286
00:30:26,339 --> 00:30:31,720
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the last page I wanted to land on which is like the fifth in this series I think Peter, there it is.

287
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:32,420
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

288
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:48,134
[SPEAKER_09]: is what I haven't described in great detail, really, is the planting palette, which, of course, we, as landscape architects, think a lot about, but don't really explain a whole lot because it gets into some nitty-gritty detail.

289
00:30:48,194 --> 00:30:52,115
[SPEAKER_09]: But if there's anyone here who wants to discuss planting, I'm happy to talk with them about it.

290
00:30:52,855 --> 00:30:57,517
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is our specific planting plan that annotates all of the new plantings and provides a full plant list.

291
00:30:58,757 --> 00:31:04,419
[SPEAKER_09]: Throughout the design, we kept in mind the need for hardy and, of course, drought tolerant

292
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:05,859
[SPEAKER_09]: plantings.

293
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:11,162
[SPEAKER_09]: And we also thought about compositions that would have four seasons of interest.

294
00:31:11,262 --> 00:31:14,063
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's not just blank in the winter, et cetera.

295
00:31:14,083 --> 00:31:23,827
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you were to take a close look at the plant list, you'd see that we have an emphasis on species that are native or native adapted to help promote biodiversity and sustainability.

296
00:31:24,947 --> 00:31:25,968
[SPEAKER_09]: So Peter, I think that's it.

297
00:31:26,008 --> 00:31:27,488
[SPEAKER_09]: Hope I didn't go on too long.

298
00:31:28,869 --> 00:31:32,911
[SPEAKER_09]: Fill in anything I missed and if there's more architecture to share, go for it.

299
00:31:32,931 --> 00:31:33,711
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

300
00:31:37,193 --> 00:31:37,634
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

301
00:31:37,654 --> 00:31:39,655
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's about it.

302
00:31:39,735 --> 00:31:45,657
[SPEAKER_11]: Perhaps, Adam, you could come back on if you want to manage questioning.

303
00:31:52,461 --> 00:31:52,701
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

304
00:31:53,481 --> 00:31:54,562
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, thank you both.

305
00:31:55,142 --> 00:32:00,685
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, with that, I think it'd be a good opportunity to take any questions.

306
00:32:01,285 --> 00:32:05,247
[SPEAKER_10]: If anybody has any questions, maybe just for the sake of, or if you want to

307
00:32:06,233 --> 00:32:10,077
[SPEAKER_10]: raise your hand on the chat function, that might help.

308
00:32:10,097 --> 00:32:11,018
[SPEAKER_10]: Turn on another light here.

309
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:19,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

310
00:32:21,007 --> 00:32:21,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

311
00:32:25,651 --> 00:32:27,172
[SPEAKER_10]: Josh and GF.

312
00:32:27,973 --> 00:32:29,955
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so yeah, go ahead, Josh.

313
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:36,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, thank you so much for presenting the proposal.

314
00:32:36,257 --> 00:32:38,078
[SPEAKER_06]: It was very well put together.

315
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:45,302
[SPEAKER_06]: I was curious about any commercial space that's in the plans.

316
00:32:46,283 --> 00:32:51,305
[SPEAKER_06]: And if not, is there a chance to possibly put a little bit of commercial space in there?

317
00:32:52,666 --> 00:32:54,107
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, Josh, this is Peter.

318
00:32:55,307 --> 00:33:00,330
[SPEAKER_11]: So the intention of the existing building is to make that a commercial use building.

319
00:33:01,645 --> 00:33:09,047
[SPEAKER_11]: It's about, with the addition, it's a little larger than 4,000 square feet plus an unfinished basement.

320
00:33:10,408 --> 00:33:15,969
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, there's quite a bit of potential there for a nice commercial space.

321
00:33:16,009 --> 00:33:19,470
[SPEAKER_11]: It could be any number of different uses that are allowed in that zone.

322
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:24,952
[SPEAKER_11]: And we've been talking with the city a little bit about what they would like to see, but I'd certainly love to hear from neighbors as well.

323
00:33:27,953 --> 00:33:28,973
[SPEAKER_11]: What are your thoughts about it?

324
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:37,999
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, being so close to the to the train line, having, you know, more commercial space, I can't I can't imagine being a bad thing.

325
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:39,779
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, exactly, exactly.

326
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:48,323
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, whatever, whatever commercial space, I think you can cram in there would go well for the for the city.

327
00:33:49,804 --> 00:33:50,625
[SPEAKER_11]: The city allows

328
00:33:53,043 --> 00:34:04,449
[SPEAKER_11]: encourages this kind of commercial space by giving you a parking exemption for commercial uses under 5,000 square feet, potentially, in this kind of district.

329
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:14,654
[SPEAKER_11]: So that really makes it much, much easier to develop something like that.

330
00:34:14,814 --> 00:34:15,514
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Josh.

331
00:34:16,635 --> 00:34:17,395
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

332
00:34:18,336 --> 00:34:20,197
[SPEAKER_10]: GF, that's the name.

333
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:25,193
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, thanks for taking time to do this presentation for the neighborhood.

334
00:34:25,213 --> 00:34:27,234
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a couple of questions.

335
00:34:28,535 --> 00:34:33,118
[SPEAKER_08]: One is for Katya about who's going to maintain all that landscape?

336
00:34:33,138 --> 00:34:36,621
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that you guys or is that other people?

337
00:34:39,723 --> 00:34:42,325
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, my firm doesn't do maintenance.

338
00:34:42,925 --> 00:34:43,866
[SPEAKER_09]: We just do the design.

339
00:34:43,926 --> 00:34:48,870
[SPEAKER_09]: So unfortunately, I don't have that kind of capacity, but I'm sure

340
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:59,981
[SPEAKER_09]: the owner can probably elaborate more on that, but whoever takes over the operational and maintenance people who would run these buildings would hire people to maintain the landscape.

341
00:35:01,821 --> 00:35:08,702
[SPEAKER_11]: The type of plantings that are selected are actually ones that don't require a huge amount of maintenance because they are native plants.

342
00:35:08,922 --> 00:35:11,103
[SPEAKER_11]: They occasionally need some trimming and the like.

343
00:35:11,183 --> 00:35:12,743
[SPEAKER_11]: I think Katja would agree with me on that.

344
00:35:13,563 --> 00:35:19,164
[SPEAKER_11]: Most of it is just kind of a naturalistic setting, like you would have in a woodland

345
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:30,697
[SPEAKER_11]: expand as it grows, but it's not a high-maintenance kind of landscape.

346
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:36,499
[SPEAKER_08]: And then my other questions are just kind of surrounding.

347
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:48,449
[SPEAKER_08]: Alfred's a one way and there's constant one way violations of people going the wrong way and causing issues with kids around here and now a ton more cars.

348
00:35:48,529 --> 00:35:52,452
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm concerned about that being, the police department hasn't done much.

349
00:35:52,472 --> 00:35:53,553
[SPEAKER_08]: City Hall hasn't done much.

350
00:35:54,093 --> 00:35:59,178
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I don't know how to mitigate that and you might not be able to, but there's gonna be more cars with less parking.

351
00:35:59,618 --> 00:36:00,238
[SPEAKER_08]: You're having more,

352
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,861
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems like you've allowed for more cars than you have spaces for.

353
00:36:05,061 --> 00:36:11,284
[SPEAKER_08]: The speeds on Winchester are scary a lot of times, and there's a massive rat problem in this area.

354
00:36:11,304 --> 00:36:23,871
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm kind of curious how all of these big things are going to be addressed, or is it going to be left to us to deal with it, which is kind of how things are going now, which is frustrating at best.

355
00:36:25,992 --> 00:36:29,074
[SPEAKER_10]: There will actually be, I think, a good opportunity

356
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:34,741
[SPEAKER_10]: site plan review portion of this application.

357
00:36:35,961 --> 00:36:42,123
[SPEAKER_10]: As we mentioned at the outset, but for those folks who may have joined a little later, this is a preliminary meeting.

358
00:36:42,143 --> 00:36:50,985
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that we're gonna address things like parking, traffic during the site plan review process with the Community Development Board.

359
00:36:51,005 --> 00:37:00,808
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that that would be a good opportunity to vet any issues you have with this specific proposal, but also it might be a good opportunity

360
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:10,288
[SPEAKER_10]: with any of the other municipal boards or departments about issues that you're having on Winchester Street, et cetera.

361
00:37:10,308 --> 00:37:22,002
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that the idea here is why this development works well now is that the hope is that it'll attract residents who are not using vehicles

362
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:37,003
[SPEAKER_10]: primarily, you know, it's close enough to public transit that we hope to kind of promote a lifestyle away from car culture to some degree, although obviously there will be more people and more cars.

363
00:37:38,444 --> 00:37:41,886
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to add to that that, you know, this public hearing process

364
00:37:43,492 --> 00:38:02,403
[SPEAKER_11]: especially through the site plan review will probably result in some mitigation that is done by, you know, at the expense of the owner in the neighborhood, which could include traffic calming measures that are paid for by the development and, you know, crosswalks and these kinds of things.

365
00:38:02,483 --> 00:38:05,825
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I think, you know, the neighborhood has the ability to influence that.

366
00:38:06,745 --> 00:38:09,847
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, for me, I'll be right there with it.

367
00:38:09,947 --> 00:38:11,088
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, I think

368
00:38:11,845 --> 00:38:29,309
[SPEAKER_11]: I think, you know, with the site plan review process is fairly holistic in that everything is looked at, including, you know, utilities and, you know, traffic and pedestrian movement and so forth, so.

369
00:38:30,309 --> 00:38:31,209
[SPEAKER_08]: When are those reviews?

370
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:33,010
[SPEAKER_11]: So once we

371
00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:44,420
[SPEAKER_11]: go through the zoning approval, we come back, that's what the city council, and correct me if I'm wrong, Adam or Victor, we come back for a site plan review.

372
00:38:46,061 --> 00:38:53,447
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's, again, that's a noticed meeting, you know, you get a notice and people know about it.

373
00:38:54,528 --> 00:39:03,815
[SPEAKER_11]: And before we even get into the room there, there will be lots of communication with various departments in the city, responding to their

374
00:39:04,228 --> 00:39:06,702
[SPEAKER_11]: to their concerns or their suggestions.

375
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:13,613
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been through it several times in Medford, so just speaking from that.

376
00:39:14,354 --> 00:39:16,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Peter, this is Victor from the city.

377
00:39:17,036 --> 00:39:20,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Those meetings are noticed to abutters within a certain radius.

378
00:39:20,538 --> 00:39:30,906
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're interested in following the project, you can email our office, Planning, Development, Sustainability, or Adam Barnowski directly.

379
00:39:30,926 --> 00:39:38,612
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're not within the radius, that's the way to keep track of the status of this project and follow along.

380
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:49,323
[SPEAKER_11]: I noticed too that the city website, the planning department's website does now list current developments.

381
00:39:50,463 --> 00:39:55,305
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I would assume this gets regular update on the city's website.

382
00:39:56,405 --> 00:40:01,326
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, Martha.

383
00:40:01,987 --> 00:40:02,487
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Martha.

384
00:40:03,533 --> 00:40:05,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, we've been handful of questions over here.

385
00:40:05,635 --> 00:40:16,828
[SPEAKER_07]: The first one, this would be to Victor or Rick or someone from the city will people that live in this building, be able to acquire parking passes for Alfred Street.

386
00:40:22,872 --> 00:40:24,873
[SPEAKER_00]: Vick, if you want, that's something that I can handle.

387
00:40:24,893 --> 00:40:25,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Alicia, do you mind?

388
00:40:26,093 --> 00:40:26,413
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

389
00:40:26,853 --> 00:40:27,794
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Alicia Hunt.

390
00:40:27,854 --> 00:40:30,975
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the Director of Planning, Development and Sustainability for the city.

391
00:40:31,275 --> 00:40:35,056
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, I'm also on the Traffic Commission per that position.

392
00:40:35,836 --> 00:40:45,680
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is actually the kind of thing that would be negotiated both through site plan review and then afterwards to come to Traffic Commission for a special permit.

393
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:51,762
[SPEAKER_00]: Many large developments like this, one of the conditions put on it through site plan review

394
00:40:52,302 --> 00:40:56,744
[SPEAKER_00]: is that the development is not allowed to get permits for street parking.

395
00:40:57,485 --> 00:41:05,329
[SPEAKER_00]: And that street is not large enough, and you can't allow like, oh, two people from that building and not all of them.

396
00:41:05,749 --> 00:41:12,172
[SPEAKER_00]: That street is not large enough to handle parking permits from 65 additional units.

397
00:41:12,932 --> 00:41:19,976
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would seem to me that that would be one of the things that we would negotiate through site plan review is that they would not be eligible.

398
00:41:20,888 --> 00:41:22,689
[SPEAKER_00]: for street parking permits.

399
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:41,401
[SPEAKER_00]: And people may not be aware, hopefully if you are a nearby at Butter, you're aware that the city is now just passed but has not yet implemented permit parking on all the streets in that region that are city of Medford public streets.

400
00:41:41,948 --> 00:41:46,733
[SPEAKER_00]: So there aren't going to be streets that people could just decide to park on.

401
00:41:47,473 --> 00:41:57,463
[SPEAKER_00]: One would hope that real estate agents when marketing the units, people when leasing the units would be clear with renters that there is not parking associated with that.

402
00:41:58,183 --> 00:42:02,728
[SPEAKER_00]: So that people could make that educated decision as they're deciding to choose to live there.

403
00:42:03,537 --> 00:42:04,798
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, appreciate that, Alicia.

404
00:42:04,918 --> 00:42:11,721
[SPEAKER_07]: I live right across the street from the property, so I'm very aware of what parking is and is not available on Alfred Street.

405
00:42:11,861 --> 00:42:14,022
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a second question and then I'm going to turn it to a neighbor.

406
00:42:14,062 --> 00:42:15,483
[SPEAKER_07]: We're here on a group call.

407
00:42:18,004 --> 00:42:29,910
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how one goes about sort of specifically objecting to any part of the plan or when that happens, but I have an extremely serious issue with a party deck on top of this.

408
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:53,198
[SPEAKER_07]: HAB-Charlotte Pitts, she-her, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-

409
00:42:55,635 --> 00:42:57,516
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't wanna hear people partying.

410
00:42:57,536 --> 00:43:02,279
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't even want the balconies, but I'm putting the hard pass on that party deck.

411
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:05,360
[SPEAKER_11]: So noted.

412
00:43:07,842 --> 00:43:09,923
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I'm gonna turn it over to, sorry, go ahead.

413
00:43:09,943 --> 00:43:13,745
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought someone was gonna say something.

414
00:43:16,407 --> 00:43:16,747
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

415
00:43:16,947 --> 00:43:19,969
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you say there was someone else on your line that had a question?

416
00:43:20,329 --> 00:43:22,450
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think someone was unmuted and so I thought it was someone else.

417
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:24,191
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm gonna turn it over to our neighbor, Fran.

418
00:43:25,473 --> 00:43:26,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, how you doing?

419
00:43:26,114 --> 00:43:28,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for the great presentation.

420
00:43:28,375 --> 00:43:38,282
[SPEAKER_03]: One of my questions I had, the driveway, I live at 9 Alfred Street, which right on the property line of this building.

421
00:43:39,143 --> 00:43:50,231
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just, you know, I'm going to be losing a little parking anyways, even though it's going to be an inactive driveway, we have to have it open at all times, obviously for the fire apparatus.

422
00:43:51,066 --> 00:44:06,020
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm also concerned on where the property building is off the property line, like how many feet back, because I know you have the driveway and you also have a little bit of grass and then you have the building itself.

423
00:44:06,621 --> 00:44:14,288
[SPEAKER_03]: I was wondering if anybody would have any accurate measurements from my property line where the building would actually be off the property line.

424
00:44:15,068 --> 00:44:15,809
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so

425
00:44:18,345 --> 00:44:20,206
[SPEAKER_11]: I can answer that approximately.

426
00:44:20,246 --> 00:44:31,633
[SPEAKER_11]: It's about, let's see, we have 25, it's about 27 feet to the building from your property line.

427
00:44:32,934 --> 00:44:33,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

428
00:44:33,675 --> 00:44:45,702
[SPEAKER_03]: And another question I had was, you know, it was a very good point that you brought out with the elevation droppings from the front to the back.

429
00:44:46,777 --> 00:44:52,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, how is that your property line where it meets my property line?

430
00:44:53,761 --> 00:45:01,845
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, the elevate the those two going to be even I mean, what's yeah, they all have to meet at grade existing grade at the property line.

431
00:45:02,185 --> 00:45:03,445
[SPEAKER_09]: Can't my property line?

432
00:45:04,106 --> 00:45:04,286
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

433
00:45:04,965 --> 00:45:16,550
[SPEAKER_09]: So in other words, I think he means a retaining wall along the north edge, which we do have, because our garage, excuse me, our driveway does drop down to meet the basement level.

434
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:21,312
[SPEAKER_09]: And therefore the northern property line does include a retaining wall that starts at zero.

435
00:45:21,672 --> 00:45:26,594
[SPEAKER_09]: And as the driveway slopes down, appears taller and taller from our side.

436
00:45:26,915 --> 00:45:29,656
[SPEAKER_09]: But from your side, I believe if you're to the north,

437
00:45:30,236 --> 00:45:36,037
[SPEAKER_09]: Frank, Frank, Frank, then I believe you would only be seeing a six foot tall fence from your side.

438
00:45:37,058 --> 00:45:44,400
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the questions I had, I looked at some of the drawings and are they accurate as far as the entrance of the garage?

439
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:53,722
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look at the garage closest towards Alfred Street entry, if you look at my plot plan on your drawing,

440
00:45:54,243 --> 00:45:57,484
[SPEAKER_03]: that actually shows the entrance at the rear of my yard.

441
00:45:57,524 --> 00:46:08,187
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to have a verification on that because you do have another drawing where it shows the garage down almost entering to the addition of my home.

442
00:46:09,368 --> 00:46:11,008
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to know like, which one is it?

443
00:46:11,388 --> 00:46:13,329
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, just for verification.

444
00:46:13,389 --> 00:46:16,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I don't mean to ask so many questions.

445
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:23,812
[SPEAKER_03]: If you could give me a, how far back from the property line is that first garage?

446
00:46:24,834 --> 00:46:33,259
[SPEAKER_03]: door go, so I could get an accurate measurement from the front of my property to where that first garage from Alford Street would stop.

447
00:46:33,279 --> 00:46:34,739
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

448
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:37,201
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you see the screen now, Frank?

449
00:46:37,881 --> 00:46:38,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm looking at it.

450
00:46:38,902 --> 00:46:39,682
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you're not sharing.

451
00:46:39,942 --> 00:46:41,463
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not seeing any architectural.

452
00:46:42,063 --> 00:46:42,224
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

453
00:46:42,244 --> 00:46:43,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

454
00:46:43,864 --> 00:46:46,506
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think maybe the best thing to do is to

455
00:46:49,355 --> 00:46:54,239
[SPEAKER_11]: we can have a conversation separate from this meeting and go into all those small details.

456
00:46:54,259 --> 00:47:02,746
[SPEAKER_11]: And I can also show you more kind of visual, like simple 3D things so you can really see what is going on there.

457
00:47:03,207 --> 00:47:03,987
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be great.

458
00:47:04,287 --> 00:47:08,251
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to tie this all up, but I'm just looking for accurate measurements.

459
00:47:08,271 --> 00:47:09,231
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, absolutely.

460
00:47:09,312 --> 00:47:14,596
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just hesitate to give them out because I don't want to give you inaccurate information.

461
00:47:14,996 --> 00:47:15,937
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, that would be great.

462
00:47:15,977 --> 00:47:16,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

463
00:47:16,838 --> 00:47:17,018
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

464
00:47:17,602 --> 00:47:20,544
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll contact you and figure out a way to get it together.

465
00:47:21,325 --> 00:47:23,386
[SPEAKER_11]: And sir, could you, what was your name?

466
00:47:23,947 --> 00:47:25,428
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Fran Ogola.

467
00:47:27,849 --> 00:47:29,851
[SPEAKER_11]: And you're at nine Alfred, I heard.

468
00:47:29,871 --> 00:47:30,511
[SPEAKER_11]: That's correct.

469
00:47:30,872 --> 00:47:31,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

470
00:47:32,773 --> 00:47:33,093
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

471
00:47:33,613 --> 00:47:33,974
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

472
00:47:33,994 --> 00:47:35,535
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

473
00:47:35,575 --> 00:47:35,875
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks.

474
00:47:38,757 --> 00:47:39,137
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

475
00:47:41,379 --> 00:47:43,840
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have any other hands raised.

476
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:44,800
[SPEAKER_10]: Any other questions?

477
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:50,402
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a few questions in chat that I think we need to pick up.

478
00:47:51,282 --> 00:47:52,563
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me just go up here a little bit.

479
00:47:52,763 --> 00:47:53,323
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks.

480
00:47:54,243 --> 00:47:57,324
[SPEAKER_11]: A rat problem has come up in a couple of these.

481
00:48:00,105 --> 00:48:10,489
[SPEAKER_11]: So usually when you construct a building like this, you go through a whole road mitigation process before you start demolition.

482
00:48:11,566 --> 00:48:19,350
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and, uh, and that, that is actually requires some certification from, from the, from the exterminator.

483
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:26,433
[SPEAKER_11]: So that, that you should just, you know, it's not like you just go start knocking buildings and, and, and, you know, the rats go running.

484
00:48:27,333 --> 00:48:37,298
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so that, that's something that we'll, you know, we'll go into more detail, um, and actually becomes part of the, of the condition, the conditions of approval.

485
00:48:40,982 --> 00:48:59,772
[SPEAKER_10]: Then there's also a comment here requesting that the applicant consider spaces for zip car in the garage and to promote less car use to consider a co-working space and a gym that the public could access for a fee.

486
00:49:00,373 --> 00:49:03,474
[SPEAKER_10]: So we can pass those comments along as well.

487
00:49:04,135 --> 00:49:05,255
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

488
00:49:05,295 --> 00:49:07,917
[SPEAKER_11]: Generally, zip car will not go into a private garage.

489
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:14,231
[SPEAKER_11]: unless it's a public type garage with a attendant.

490
00:49:15,011 --> 00:49:24,333
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's, we've tried many times to get Zipcars in private rental garages or condos or anything like that and they just won't go.

491
00:49:25,373 --> 00:49:25,633
[SPEAKER_11]: So.

492
00:49:26,113 --> 00:49:28,474
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a hand from Lucy.

493
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:37,228
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, can you hear me.

494
00:49:37,748 --> 00:49:38,068
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

495
00:49:38,588 --> 00:49:39,709
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

496
00:49:39,849 --> 00:49:58,553
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I did notice missing from your drawing is Somerville has put in a big traffic bump out right in front of that house at the end of Winchester Street, so it narrows the entrance and exit for the traffic at Winchester and.

497
00:50:02,063 --> 00:50:06,465
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we will be a huge hindrance to traffic there as well.

498
00:50:07,765 --> 00:50:11,587
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that may be a good thing, right?

499
00:50:11,707 --> 00:50:16,349
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, only if only if you're not trying to access that into the street.

500
00:50:16,909 --> 00:50:17,129
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

501
00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:22,111
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah, some people has been doing a lot of things over there.

502
00:50:22,171 --> 00:50:30,135
[SPEAKER_11]: They're also about to implement this big bicycle, you know,

503
00:50:31,441 --> 00:50:31,801
[SPEAKER_11]: lanes.

504
00:50:31,841 --> 00:50:33,022
[SPEAKER_11]: They may have already painted them.

505
00:50:33,142 --> 00:50:35,283
[SPEAKER_11]: I know they were starting it earlier in the summer.

506
00:50:36,984 --> 00:50:44,109
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, we haven't quite caught up with all those in terms of getting them right on our drawings, but we will at some point.

507
00:50:44,689 --> 00:50:47,511
[SPEAKER_01]: It severely narrowed the end of Winchester Street.

508
00:50:47,571 --> 00:50:52,474
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the traffic, you know, if you have three cars trying to get down Winchester Street,

509
00:50:52,957 --> 00:50:58,921
[SPEAKER_01]: it brings everything to a stop because Broadway has to stop to let everybody come in and out.

510
00:50:59,402 --> 00:51:02,023
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very bad right at that intersection.

511
00:51:02,584 --> 00:51:07,647
[SPEAKER_01]: So you might want to take a look at that while you're doing all your planning.

512
00:51:08,668 --> 00:51:09,949
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for alerting us to that.

513
00:51:10,409 --> 00:51:10,709
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

514
00:51:13,852 --> 00:51:16,453
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see Martha's got her hand up again.

515
00:51:16,473 --> 00:51:16,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, sorry.

516
00:51:23,224 --> 00:51:32,610
[SPEAKER_11]: Hold on a minute we got to meet somebody.

517
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:33,231
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

518
00:51:33,711 --> 00:51:34,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, cool.

519
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:43,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so we have a building web up the street on Broadway and Somerville recently over some of the shops on

520
00:51:45,514 --> 00:51:46,615
[SPEAKER_07]: lagoon square and down.

521
00:51:47,235 --> 00:51:49,597
[SPEAKER_07]: And it doesn't obviously look anything like the neighborhood.

522
00:51:49,617 --> 00:51:51,978
[SPEAKER_07]: And this one doesn't look anything like the neighborhood.

523
00:51:52,039 --> 00:52:01,144
[SPEAKER_07]: So what kind of consideration did you take in trying to make it look like it sort of even slightly fits in around here?

524
00:52:01,184 --> 00:52:06,128
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's looks completely different than every other structure around it.

525
00:52:07,849 --> 00:52:10,330
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, sort of making it stand out even more so.

526
00:52:10,811 --> 00:52:14,573
[SPEAKER_07]: So can you explain to me, you know, any considerations taken on the existing sort of

527
00:52:16,077 --> 00:52:20,940
[SPEAKER_07]: if you can call it in this neighborhood, architectural style of everything else.

528
00:52:21,921 --> 00:52:23,341
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

529
00:52:23,482 --> 00:52:24,642
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so that's an interesting question.

530
00:52:24,682 --> 00:52:33,908
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's very difficult to provide a building that, you know, has this number of units that looks like a two and a half story residential building.

531
00:52:33,968 --> 00:52:35,209
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, I think we have to be

532
00:52:36,296 --> 00:52:39,178
[SPEAKER_11]: honest that it is a much bigger building.

533
00:52:39,719 --> 00:52:48,426
[SPEAKER_11]: But that being said, there are a lot of features that are similar, such as the use of clapboard, the use of trim around windows.

534
00:52:49,066 --> 00:52:53,730
[SPEAKER_11]: The proportioning of windows is similar to what you have on, say, this historic house.

535
00:52:54,791 --> 00:52:57,533
[SPEAKER_11]: Instead of having very, very large expansives of

536
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:08,987
[SPEAKER_11]: plate glass, we break down those into smaller subunits.

537
00:53:09,807 --> 00:53:13,729
[SPEAKER_11]: And we also project bays forward, even though they're done in a contemporary style.

538
00:53:14,689 --> 00:53:16,930
[SPEAKER_11]: That's something that a lot of buildings have in the area.

539
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:24,332
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we have this existing building, for instance, has this exaggerated front

540
00:53:26,112 --> 00:53:26,893
[SPEAKER_11]: roof overhang.

541
00:53:27,093 --> 00:53:28,674
[SPEAKER_11]: We also have a sewer roof overhang.

542
00:53:28,714 --> 00:53:34,559
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's a lot of features that actually give a nice sense of scale and also detail to the building.

543
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:43,085
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know which you're referring to, that project in Lagoon, that you won't see any of that on that building.

544
00:53:49,459 --> 00:53:52,461
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't mean that, you know, to make anybody laugh.

545
00:53:53,002 --> 00:54:05,069
[SPEAKER_11]: It really, there are a lot of features on a building like this that, you know, are carefully thought out to try to not mimic, but, you know, just relate to the other buildings in the neighborhood.

546
00:54:05,630 --> 00:54:08,712
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think you can see that, you know, in this picture as well.

547
00:54:11,093 --> 00:54:11,594
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, thanks.

548
00:54:11,734 --> 00:54:14,095
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe understand the effort.

549
00:54:19,682 --> 00:54:24,107
[SPEAKER_07]: And then also another question from this team, asking where the trash is going to be located.

550
00:54:25,569 --> 00:54:31,636
[SPEAKER_11]: So there, there's a trash room in the basement, fairly large, which will contain and close.

551
00:54:33,986 --> 00:54:35,347
[SPEAKER_11]: either dumpsters or the bins.

552
00:54:35,927 --> 00:54:46,513
[SPEAKER_11]: And those will be collected and brought out to the truck when it comes once a week or so.

553
00:54:47,953 --> 00:54:48,654
[SPEAKER_11]: That's how it works.

554
00:54:48,934 --> 00:54:51,335
[SPEAKER_11]: I can show you where that is in the garage if you'd like.

555
00:54:53,856 --> 00:54:54,216
[SPEAKER_11]: Right here.

556
00:54:54,777 --> 00:54:56,438
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's actually

557
00:54:58,357 --> 00:55:06,099
[SPEAKER_11]: Trash comes down through, you know, through trash chutes in the building to kind of keep all the trash together.

558
00:55:06,119 --> 00:55:13,221
[SPEAKER_11]: It's collected in bins that are rolled over to a dumpster enclosure that has its own garage door.

559
00:55:14,181 --> 00:55:26,705
[SPEAKER_11]: And that opens up out here so that they can be wheeled out to, you know, any kind of, you know, pickup that they might do either with dumpsters.

560
00:55:27,138 --> 00:55:28,599
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you screened?

561
00:55:28,619 --> 00:55:29,600
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you not screened?

562
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:30,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Pointing at them?

563
00:55:31,041 --> 00:55:32,863
[SPEAKER_11]: I keep forgetting that I'm not sharing the screen.

564
00:55:33,103 --> 00:55:34,064
[SPEAKER_11]: I really apologize.

565
00:55:34,124 --> 00:55:34,624
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

566
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:38,447
[SPEAKER_10]: Peter, you can go ahead and go ahead.

567
00:55:38,768 --> 00:55:42,511
[SPEAKER_10]: Why don't you go ahead and share just so we can walk through that question.

568
00:55:43,792 --> 00:55:43,952
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

569
00:55:45,293 --> 00:55:45,653
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

570
00:55:49,116 --> 00:55:51,458
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm glad you stopped me because I was just going on and on.

571
00:55:51,478 --> 00:55:55,781
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so this is a view in the basement.

572
00:55:57,445 --> 00:56:08,390
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, you have a parking garage on one side, and as I mentioned, because of the different heights, the other side, the other wing toward Alfred is residences.

573
00:56:09,930 --> 00:56:15,153
[SPEAKER_11]: But nonetheless, we have a trash collection area where we have trash chutes that come down from above.

574
00:56:16,073 --> 00:56:24,837
[SPEAKER_11]: And then those usually have these kind of wheeled bins that will then go into a dumpster enclosure over on the other part of the garage.

575
00:56:25,593 --> 00:56:33,054
[SPEAKER_11]: And that has a garage door overhead door where, you know, a dump truck, not dump truck, a trash truck can come down and collect those.

576
00:56:34,475 --> 00:56:37,615
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably take about 15 minutes once or twice a week.

577
00:56:39,415 --> 00:56:40,276
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's how it's done.

578
00:56:40,696 --> 00:56:49,617
[SPEAKER_11]: This will be a vented room, you know, so it doesn't create any smell in the area.

579
00:56:53,638 --> 00:56:54,378
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there another question?

580
00:56:57,353 --> 00:56:57,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

581
00:57:00,195 --> 00:57:07,060
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's going to be coming out of the garage garage closest to Alfred Street.

582
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:10,122
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be the next garage up where the trash is going to be.

583
00:57:10,442 --> 00:57:11,723
[SPEAKER_11]: It's service from Winchester.

584
00:57:12,264 --> 00:57:13,365
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, thank you.

585
00:57:14,766 --> 00:57:18,909
[SPEAKER_10]: There were some questions about about what the timeline of the project is.

586
00:57:19,589 --> 00:57:19,749
[SPEAKER_10]: It's

587
00:57:22,462 --> 00:57:35,329
[SPEAKER_10]: We will likely apply to the city under the PDD at some point during the early fall, and a site plan will occur either in tandem or after that period of time.

588
00:57:35,789 --> 00:57:46,254
[SPEAKER_10]: I know this is a new process for the city, so there hasn't been enough of these that have gone through to know exactly what the timeline looks like, but it will

589
00:57:48,663 --> 00:57:50,646
[SPEAKER_10]: later part of this year approval.

590
00:57:50,706 --> 00:58:05,304
[SPEAKER_10]: So, as we mentioned, this will be, we will be notifying the voters of this, as well as there will be notices posted at the city's website and on the planning and city council agendas.

591
00:58:09,625 --> 00:58:11,066
[SPEAKER_11]: see if there's any other comments here.

592
00:58:11,966 --> 00:58:14,508
[SPEAKER_11]: There was one comment about utilities.

593
00:58:15,608 --> 00:58:21,352
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll be providing a utility study as part of this site claim review process.

594
00:58:25,754 --> 00:58:32,318
[SPEAKER_11]: Initially, I think we didn't run into any initial problems, but it will be reviewed in more detail.

595
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:40,425
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, there's a question about how long will construction take?

596
00:58:40,445 --> 00:58:47,234
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know that that's been vetted yet, but we will address that at some point during the community approval process.

597
00:58:50,518 --> 00:58:52,741
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, the question about electric cars.

598
00:58:56,621 --> 00:59:04,085
[SPEAKER_11]: Since we drew this, I actually have about 10 or 12 spaces for electric cars at this point.

599
00:59:04,785 --> 00:59:14,070
[SPEAKER_11]: But since we drew this, you all probably have read that California is going to eliminate gasoline vehicles by 2035.

600
00:59:16,051 --> 00:59:18,132
[SPEAKER_11]: And Massachusetts will follow in suit.

601
00:59:20,803 --> 00:59:31,666
[SPEAKER_11]: And so, you know, I would expect that we'll probably be adding more chargers, or at least charger-ready stations throughout.

602
00:59:33,046 --> 00:59:36,367
[SPEAKER_10]: Peter, there's a question about storm drains being installed in the driveway.

603
00:59:36,387 --> 00:59:39,348
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think we'll put them in the driveway.

604
00:59:39,368 --> 00:59:42,688
[SPEAKER_11]: They'll be in the spaces around the buildings where we have landscape.

605
00:59:44,129 --> 00:59:46,269
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's quite difficult to put them on a slope.

606
00:59:49,862 --> 00:59:53,605
[SPEAKER_09]: there would need to be trench drains at the low points of those driveways, of course.

607
00:59:54,105 --> 00:59:54,285
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

608
00:59:54,305 --> 00:59:54,546
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

609
00:59:54,686 --> 00:59:55,566
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

610
01:00:02,511 --> 01:00:02,952
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

611
01:00:03,132 --> 01:00:08,836
[SPEAKER_11]: If that's the question of collecting water on the driveways, there will be trench drains for that.

612
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:15,541
[SPEAKER_10]: Any other questions or comments from the public?

613
01:00:20,673 --> 01:00:25,518
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, seeing and hearing, oh, looks like one while they're here.

614
01:00:25,598 --> 01:00:28,481
[SPEAKER_10]: Debbie, go ahead and unmute.

615
01:00:31,172 --> 01:00:41,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, so I had put the comment in the chat, but, you know, being where I also live in Somerville, Broadway, so just kind of like where Winchester meets Broadway.

616
01:00:42,455 --> 01:00:45,576
[SPEAKER_04]: So I agree with what, you know, I'm hearing a lot of people say that just like the flow.

617
01:00:45,596 --> 01:00:56,239
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know there's other processes with like the traffic flow in the area, but to really promote not needing a car right now, we, you know, with a family of four, we need to access services.

618
01:00:56,299 --> 01:00:59,060
[SPEAKER_04]: So is there any plan for the belt that are

619
01:01:01,507 --> 01:01:08,431
[SPEAKER_04]: A public gym space that, you know, locals could use or maybe a co working space.

620
01:01:09,072 --> 01:01:10,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, that's a public could use.

621
01:01:11,473 --> 01:01:19,738
[SPEAKER_04]: I know there's a, I think I heard something about commercial space I'm sorry if I missed some of that discussion, but if there's, you know, things to promote.

622
01:01:21,319 --> 01:01:25,140
[SPEAKER_04]: not need to get into your car would be helpful as this project.

623
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:26,861
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a big scale project.

624
01:01:26,881 --> 01:01:28,481
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's like a lot of opportunity here.

625
01:01:28,601 --> 01:01:32,883
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you for listening and just kind of keeping that open mind.

626
01:01:32,903 --> 01:01:38,685
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe providing some services that would be helpful to ease up the need to be in the car.

627
01:01:39,505 --> 01:01:39,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

628
01:01:40,995 --> 01:01:41,616
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Debbie.

629
01:01:41,916 --> 01:01:56,310
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and we, I'm not sure if it was your comment or somebody else's that they make some some similar suggestions earlier so I think we can definitely take that to to the applicant when they're when they're looking at, you know, potential uses for for the corner space.

630
01:02:05,912 --> 01:02:16,074
[SPEAKER_11]: and it would be easy to convert that building to either of those uses that you mentioned if a tenant could be found to run it.

631
01:02:17,934 --> 01:02:24,416
[SPEAKER_10]: And I will give a plug to Jesse and Max who do comment that they own a gym at 96 Winchester.

632
01:02:24,476 --> 01:02:29,717
[SPEAKER_10]: So if anybody's looking for an amenity in the meantime at least, please visit their establishment.

633
01:02:30,557 --> 01:02:34,398
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, there was one question about what will happen to the house at 104 Winchester

634
01:02:36,066 --> 01:02:43,032
[SPEAKER_10]: Peter, you mentioned this a little bit, but do you want to talk in a little more detail about that portion of the site?

635
01:02:44,133 --> 01:02:50,258
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so I think maybe because I talked about it early on, can you let me share the screen?

636
01:02:50,558 --> 01:02:50,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

637
01:02:57,744 --> 01:02:58,564
[SPEAKER_11]: Still, it's still you.

638
01:03:10,202 --> 01:03:29,116
[SPEAKER_11]: So in the very corner of the site where the existing building is, we're proposing to retain the main mass of that building, add a new front porch, and then remove what's existing in the rear and build a new kind of commercial wing on that building.

639
01:03:30,698 --> 01:03:38,904
[SPEAKER_11]: That would have an elevator and it would be handicapped accessible grade and have the fire safety stairs and so forth.

640
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:51,929
[SPEAKER_11]: The idea is that this is set up as a number of different uses that could fill a space depending on how they want to use it.

641
01:03:52,569 --> 01:03:59,274
[SPEAKER_11]: So in addition to that, we also create a very large courtyard with the existing tree in place there.

642
01:04:01,055 --> 01:04:08,180
[SPEAKER_11]: So that is, you can see that in here in this kind of aerial view.

643
01:04:09,970 --> 01:04:16,716
[SPEAKER_11]: So potentially, you know, those uses that were mentioned go in here if somebody wanted to run that sort of business.

644
01:04:18,117 --> 01:04:21,460
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's any number of different things that could go in here.

645
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:28,967
[SPEAKER_11]: And at the same time, you know, we maintain scale and kind of historic diversity with this nice restored front door.

646
01:04:41,065 --> 01:04:44,331
Thanks, Peter.

647
01:04:44,371 --> 01:04:46,654
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

648
01:04:57,203 --> 01:04:58,104
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, any other hand?

649
01:04:58,524 --> 01:04:59,885
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see, I'm looking at the chat here.

650
01:05:00,266 --> 01:05:05,910
[SPEAKER_10]: Any environmental studies in the project with noise study due to close to track?

651
01:05:06,211 --> 01:05:11,875
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't believe that a noise study is required here.

652
01:05:11,955 --> 01:05:18,180
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure if you mean, is a noise study required for the noise that the building would emanate or for the noise that might be coming into the building?

653
01:05:18,821 --> 01:05:25,286
[SPEAKER_10]: In either event, I don't believe that a noise study is required for a residential use, but Victor or Alicia could certainly

654
01:05:26,687 --> 01:05:28,228
[SPEAKER_10]: differ if that's not the case.

655
01:05:31,671 --> 01:05:37,595
[SPEAKER_10]: There is a shadow study that will be conducted or that has been conducted relative to the impact on neighboring buildings.

656
01:05:39,957 --> 01:05:44,600
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we'll submit that with the rest of our material.

657
01:05:46,222 --> 01:05:48,703
[SPEAKER_10]: Is the building pursuing any level of LEED certification?

658
01:05:48,743 --> 01:05:50,245
[SPEAKER_10]: Peter, do we have an answer on that at this point?

659
01:05:51,145 --> 01:05:53,407
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't, but having done quite a few

660
01:06:00,712 --> 01:06:07,518
[SPEAKER_10]: HAB-Jacques Juilland, Moderator): And there's a question about whether the drawings are online for you to study the so this presentation will be online the.

661
01:06:07,958 --> 01:06:21,090
[SPEAKER_10]: HAB-Jacques Juilland, Moderator): The project will probably be amended, at least in part, I would assume from some of the conversations that we've had today and some of the comments, I know that once once there's a formal submission.

662
01:06:21,737 --> 01:06:31,083
[SPEAKER_10]: of this project to the city, then those plans will be available online as part of the packets of the board, but won't be until that time.

663
01:06:31,103 --> 01:06:43,772
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, any other comments?

664
01:06:47,634 --> 01:06:49,756
[SPEAKER_10]: Victor, Alicia, any comments from the city side?

665
01:06:53,182 --> 01:06:58,045
[SPEAKER_05]: No, thank you everyone for coming out tonight and sharing your thoughts and asking great questions.

666
01:06:58,685 --> 01:07:15,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Please stay tuned as this continues on and we will, like I said, do our best to make sure folks are aware of upcoming meetings and you're welcome to reach out to us directly if you have any follow-up questions.

667
01:07:16,235 --> 01:07:20,057
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know Adam included his contact information, so please reach out to him as well.

668
01:07:20,958 --> 01:07:22,819
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, please feel free to contact me.

669
01:07:22,859 --> 01:07:30,985
[SPEAKER_10]: My email was on the flyer, but for those who may not have it, it's ARB at R-I-W.com.

670
01:07:31,225 --> 01:07:34,287
[SPEAKER_10]: ARB at R-I-W.com.

671
01:07:35,088 --> 01:07:35,668
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you all.

672
01:07:35,688 --> 01:07:37,750
[SPEAKER_10]: We really appreciate everyone.

673
01:07:38,190 --> 01:07:39,391
