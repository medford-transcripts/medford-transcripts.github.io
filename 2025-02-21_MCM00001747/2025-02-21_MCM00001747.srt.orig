1
00:00:00,371 --> 00:00:08,816
[SPEAKER_00]: The public meeting of the City of Medford License Commission for 2-20-2025 will come to order.

2
00:00:10,416 --> 00:00:11,617
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have an agenda.

3
00:00:16,259 --> 00:00:19,101
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have the minutes on this one from last month, correct?

4
00:00:19,121 --> 00:00:19,161
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

5
00:00:19,181 --> 00:00:20,882
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to send it to you next month, but that's okay.

6
00:00:21,627 --> 00:00:22,568
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, no, that's fine.

7
00:00:22,848 --> 00:00:23,289
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine.

8
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:26,512
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to make sure that I didn't miss it.

9
00:00:28,093 --> 00:00:34,780
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so since we don't have minutes, we'll just follow the agenda and go right down the line, I guess.

10
00:00:36,441 --> 00:00:37,623
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what we got here.

11
00:00:48,612 --> 00:00:49,133
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

12
00:00:50,814 --> 00:00:55,197
[SPEAKER_00]: Representative from Chef Jason's Catered Events, are you here?

13
00:00:57,479 --> 00:00:58,660
[SPEAKER_00]: I see Chef Jason.

14
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,361
[SPEAKER_00]: You can unmute, Chef Jason.

15
00:01:03,143 --> 00:01:03,784
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I'm here.

16
00:01:04,485 --> 00:01:04,885
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.

17
00:01:05,105 --> 00:01:05,385
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.

18
00:01:05,786 --> 00:01:06,126
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

19
00:01:07,026 --> 00:01:08,608
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us a little bit about what's going on.

20
00:01:08,628 --> 00:01:12,851
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have a private event over at the Medford Library.

21
00:01:14,388 --> 00:01:18,490
[SPEAKER_06]: doing soda water, beer, and wine for 50 people.

22
00:01:22,873 --> 00:01:24,734
[SPEAKER_00]: All righty, let's see.

23
00:01:26,835 --> 00:01:31,057
[SPEAKER_00]: One day, ACM Entertainment, one day license.

24
00:01:34,419 --> 00:01:40,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Chef Jason, what's your business or background?

25
00:01:40,162 --> 00:01:42,544
[SPEAKER_03]: You're the owner of the catering company?

26
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,422
[SPEAKER_06]: Co-owner, yeah, me and my wife own the company.

27
00:01:48,464 --> 00:01:49,765
[SPEAKER_06]: My company is five years.

28
00:01:50,405 --> 00:01:57,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Previously, I worked for, I was the executive chef and general manager for Montpelier Plaza in Stoneham for almost 15 years.

29
00:01:57,831 --> 00:02:01,994
[SPEAKER_06]: Tilt-off steakhouse before that for eight and a half.

30
00:02:04,015 --> 00:02:05,636
[SPEAKER_06]: A few other odds and ends in between.

31
00:02:05,656 --> 00:02:07,318
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

32
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:07,718
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

33
00:02:09,593 --> 00:02:10,914
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, great.

34
00:02:11,994 --> 00:02:20,358
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed that you did say that it's at the library, but address of premise, you put P.O.

35
00:02:20,398 --> 00:02:21,978
[SPEAKER_00]: Box 45, Tewksbury.

36
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:26,780
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the library's address should have went in.

37
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,181
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Gary, if you can just- Oh, okay.

38
00:02:29,201 --> 00:02:29,502
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

39
00:02:30,022 --> 00:02:32,303
[SPEAKER_00]: That it's the library's, just so we know.

40
00:02:33,357 --> 00:02:35,939
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not his fault, it's the application for some reason.

41
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:42,285
[SPEAKER_05]: When you put the address, like the applicant's address, it automatically goes in that box too.

42
00:02:42,325 --> 00:02:43,506
[SPEAKER_05]: It needs to be fixed on my end.

43
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:45,989
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's, but it's not him.

44
00:02:46,309 --> 00:02:50,273
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the one I have in front of me has high speed.

45
00:02:50,773 --> 00:02:51,474
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's fine.

46
00:02:52,595 --> 00:02:53,015
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.

47
00:02:54,797 --> 00:02:55,677
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks okay to me.

48
00:02:55,698 --> 00:02:58,380
[SPEAKER_00]: Ben, did you have a chance to look at all of them?

49
00:02:58,774 --> 00:02:58,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

50
00:02:59,234 --> 00:02:59,955
[SPEAKER_03]: I've looked it over.

51
00:03:00,035 --> 00:03:13,187
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, everything looks, all the boxes are checked and the insurance is, is there, and it's, uh, you know, uh, sorry, you know, registered licensed bartender, you know, doing it at the library.

52
00:03:13,267 --> 00:03:16,130
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not, um, I'm not concerned about it.

53
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:19,473
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would, uh, you know, I would approve this or make a motion.

54
00:03:21,106 --> 00:03:25,951
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I see the insurance and the driving and all that good stuff as well.

55
00:03:26,011 --> 00:03:27,752
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll second that motion.

56
00:03:28,313 --> 00:03:29,074
[SPEAKER_00]: All those in favor?

57
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:30,015
[SPEAKER_00]: Aye.

58
00:03:32,297 --> 00:03:34,959
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, the motion has it.

59
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,981
[SPEAKER_00]: Your license has been approved.

60
00:03:40,325 --> 00:03:41,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

61
00:03:42,447 --> 00:03:42,947
[SPEAKER_00]: All righty.

62
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:45,610
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.

63
00:03:49,348 --> 00:03:51,489
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on to the next one.

64
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,691
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I'm a little disarrayed today.

65
00:03:55,911 --> 00:03:58,091
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing threw me off this morning.

66
00:03:58,672 --> 00:04:03,754
[SPEAKER_00]: That and the fire alarm, I guess, all together at having rolled in a one.

67
00:04:03,934 --> 00:04:05,214
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

68
00:04:06,275 --> 00:04:09,156
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a representative from Ocean State Job Lot here.

69
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,361
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see one, do we, Daria?

70
00:04:21,322 --> 00:04:22,222
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see one either.

71
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:23,843
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to have to reach out to them again.

72
00:04:24,103 --> 00:04:26,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Commissioner, maybe we could see if they come in by the end of the meeting.

73
00:04:26,985 --> 00:04:31,887
[SPEAKER_03]: If not, we'll just skip them and... Yeah, yeah, we can do that.

74
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:34,068
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that won't be a problem.

75
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:37,450
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, let's see.

76
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:40,791
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?

77
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:45,674
[SPEAKER_00]: MedFed, and we've got... I think we've got three from...

78
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,720
[SPEAKER_00]: ACM you here.

79
00:04:51,601 --> 00:04:52,641
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, that's Hendrick.

80
00:04:52,681 --> 00:04:53,261
[SPEAKER_00]: You can mute.

81
00:04:53,281 --> 00:04:53,822
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

82
00:04:54,142 --> 00:04:54,422
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.

83
00:04:55,582 --> 00:04:58,343
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we see that.

84
00:04:58,383 --> 00:05:00,164
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, tell us a little bit about what's going on.

85
00:05:00,204 --> 00:05:02,764
[SPEAKER_00]: I see 3, 1 day license applications.

86
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,825
[SPEAKER_00]: I did see your insurance as well.

87
00:05:06,503 --> 00:05:10,945
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can kind of give us a rundown of what's going on, if you don't mind.

88
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:11,645
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

89
00:05:13,025 --> 00:05:15,886
[SPEAKER_01]: I will start with the coolest one.

90
00:05:17,707 --> 00:05:24,849
[SPEAKER_01]: The March 2nd is a Mardi Gras party, and we're selling tickets.

91
00:05:24,929 --> 00:05:29,211
[SPEAKER_01]: I should mention that we've already sold 65 tickets, which is above the

92
00:05:32,612 --> 00:05:51,742
[SPEAKER_01]: estimate I'm guessing based on that is probably going to be more like a hundred people just Usually people buy tickets more close to the event and we're selling more at the beginning of the sales so That that's my my guesstimate I

93
00:05:52,822 --> 00:06:02,265
[SPEAKER_01]: The artist that's coming is one of the princes of New Orleans, Andrew, I'm sorry, Glen David Andrews.

94
00:06:02,285 --> 00:06:10,008
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was in the band that reopened Bourbon Street after the terrorist attack this year.

95
00:06:11,769 --> 00:06:13,749
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's really something.

96
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:20,394
[SPEAKER_01]: And I brought him a couple of other times to the city when I was working at the porch.

97
00:06:21,035 --> 00:06:30,682
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, we did an event for Juneteenth as well, actually in the city hall.

98
00:06:32,073 --> 00:06:32,373
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

99
00:06:33,214 --> 00:06:33,614
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.

100
00:06:34,415 --> 00:06:37,057
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, that's not an issue.

101
00:06:37,478 --> 00:06:39,159
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the more the merrier, that's fine.

102
00:06:40,961 --> 00:06:45,785
[SPEAKER_01]: March 6th is a smaller blues performance with Cheryl Arena.

103
00:06:45,865 --> 00:06:50,609
[SPEAKER_01]: She's an Arlington resident and a great harmonica teacher and songwriter.

104
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:56,794
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm guessing somewhere between 35 and 50 people will be at that.

105
00:06:57,675 --> 00:06:58,235
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

106
00:06:59,276 --> 00:07:14,996
[SPEAKER_01]: And the third is an adult trivia night, really a community building kind of event that the ACM is holding, probably between 40 and 50 people in that as well.

107
00:07:17,545 --> 00:07:17,865
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

108
00:07:22,187 --> 00:07:32,330
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing I had noticed on two of the applications, the boxes weren't checked for either wine and malt or all alcohol.

109
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:41,954
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them was wine and malt, but you did mention in the description that you would be serving wine and malt, so I'm just assuming that's all you're going to be doing on all three.

110
00:07:42,574 --> 00:07:48,479
[SPEAKER_01]: On the March 2nd, there's going to be hurricanes that are pre-made and sold.

111
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,421
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a hurricane spritzer.

112
00:07:51,662 --> 00:07:55,605
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the same size pour as a glass of wine.

113
00:07:56,886 --> 00:08:02,852
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, in that case, in that application, I think we should just change that one to all alcohol.

114
00:08:03,472 --> 00:08:03,712
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

115
00:08:03,752 --> 00:08:06,114
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you make it with alcohol, correct, the spritzer?

116
00:08:06,295 --> 00:08:06,435
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

117
00:08:07,414 --> 00:08:08,094
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

118
00:08:08,114 --> 00:08:13,656
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, a professional will be doing it so that it's as close to reality as possible.

119
00:08:14,257 --> 00:08:15,057
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, that's fine.

120
00:08:15,577 --> 00:08:18,678
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that, you know, we want to keep the book straight, that's all.

121
00:08:19,158 --> 00:08:19,739
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

122
00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:24,820
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's only on the one for the sixth, you said?

123
00:08:25,341 --> 00:08:25,841
[SPEAKER_00]: The second.

124
00:08:26,561 --> 00:08:26,821
[SPEAKER_00]: The second.

125
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:27,561
[SPEAKER_00]: The Mardi Gras one.

126
00:08:28,142 --> 00:08:29,282
[SPEAKER_00]: The Mardi Gras, okay, yep.

127
00:08:30,382 --> 00:08:34,164
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Daria, if you can just check that off on the one on the second just to,

128
00:08:35,825 --> 00:08:36,585
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it straight.

129
00:08:37,026 --> 00:08:37,846
[SPEAKER_00]: Ben, how about you?

130
00:08:37,926 --> 00:08:42,368
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you had a chance to look over them and check it out?

131
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:44,069
[SPEAKER_00]: The insurance look great.

132
00:08:44,809 --> 00:08:47,511
[SPEAKER_00]: I see that you took it out for the whole year.

133
00:08:47,571 --> 00:08:52,573
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously you guys are planning on doing some different events.

134
00:08:54,574 --> 00:08:57,155
[SPEAKER_00]: You do know that there's a limit on 30 for the year.

135
00:08:57,175 --> 00:09:00,797
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing is,

136
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:10,988
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I think the other thing was, um, just keep in mind for the future.

137
00:09:11,789 --> 00:09:23,032
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can, um, give the area enough notice, um, about the events, because we have to by law post it at least 48 hours, um, a public meeting.

138
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,353
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we really can't.

139
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:31,855
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, do too much if it's a last minute thing, you know, we'll be trying to accommodate as best we can.

140
00:09:32,556 --> 00:09:33,236
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.

141
00:09:34,171 --> 00:09:37,874
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're in the last and the last minute thing.

142
00:09:38,735 --> 00:09:46,602
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure there was I was going to mention that to all of the folks that that came before us with a 1 day this week.

143
00:09:47,183 --> 00:09:49,905
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it was you or might have been the last 1.

144
00:09:51,927 --> 00:10:01,195
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that sometimes they come in the last minute and we have to really, you know, we try our best to accommodate, but legally we're not supposed to because of the.

145
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:05,124
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Daria told us she might've had a little delay on her end.

146
00:10:05,684 --> 00:10:06,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what I'm getting?

147
00:10:07,324 --> 00:10:08,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

148
00:10:08,145 --> 00:10:08,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

149
00:10:08,485 --> 00:10:09,645
[SPEAKER_05]: She gave it to me on Tuesday.

150
00:10:10,385 --> 00:10:10,625
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, okay.

151
00:10:10,645 --> 00:10:12,646
[SPEAKER_05]: I put that down on Friday, last Friday.

152
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:13,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotcha.

153
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:14,586
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, okay.

154
00:10:14,606 --> 00:10:17,927
[SPEAKER_03]: So this all looks good to me.

155
00:10:18,087 --> 00:10:22,468
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, so this is the building that's right next door to the Great American Beer Hall.

156
00:10:22,968 --> 00:10:24,249
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, to Atlas Liquors.

157
00:10:24,889 --> 00:10:25,529
[SPEAKER_01]: Atlas, yes.

158
00:10:26,997 --> 00:10:37,267
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, okay, yeah, and then so is it a, the Arts Collaborative, Medford, is it like it's a space that you're hosting it at this business space?

159
00:10:38,050 --> 00:11:01,796
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, so the relationship is that Theory Wellness, the dispensary that's on the same property, was required, this is my understanding, so if I'm wrong, was required by the city to pay for the space for an arts collaborative that was based on Medford Artists and community building for the arts.

160
00:11:02,397 --> 00:11:06,858
[SPEAKER_01]: So the relationship is that we have the front of the building,

161
00:11:07,938 --> 00:11:09,959
[SPEAKER_01]: which used to be the VW dealership.

162
00:11:11,419 --> 00:11:16,920
[SPEAKER_01]: And it hosts a number of 13 different artist studios that rent space.

163
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,641
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do gallery openings.

164
00:11:20,161 --> 00:11:24,162
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I came on, we're doing musical events.

165
00:11:24,502 --> 00:11:29,984
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're using the equipment from the porch when it closed.

166
00:11:30,544 --> 00:11:33,945
[SPEAKER_01]: The owners donated to the nonprofit.

167
00:11:34,605 --> 00:11:35,285
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we- Okay.

168
00:11:36,025 --> 00:11:39,067
[SPEAKER_01]: able to keep it all in Medford, which was really exciting for me.

169
00:11:40,088 --> 00:11:40,448
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

170
00:11:41,028 --> 00:11:41,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

171
00:11:41,429 --> 00:11:41,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Got it.

172
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:41,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Got it.

173
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:44,731
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the Spencer, he's like behind there or something?

174
00:11:44,751 --> 00:11:44,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

175
00:11:45,651 --> 00:11:55,598
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't, I mean, other than getting permission to like, you know, put a sign up or whatever, we don't really work with them at all.

176
00:11:57,082 --> 00:11:57,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

177
00:11:58,483 --> 00:11:58,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

178
00:11:58,783 --> 00:11:59,123
[SPEAKER_03]: Got it.

179
00:11:59,183 --> 00:12:00,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Just was trying to understand that.

180
00:12:00,644 --> 00:12:04,205
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, um, no, I mean, like, I think everything's good here.

181
00:12:04,245 --> 00:12:06,686
[SPEAKER_03]: There's, it's not a licensed bartender though.

182
00:12:06,706 --> 00:12:08,967
[SPEAKER_03]: That's serving or a tip certified person.

183
00:12:09,027 --> 00:12:17,831
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just volunteers that are serving the, you know, it's, it's, uh, on the second, it's two tip certified catering people.

184
00:12:18,392 --> 00:12:21,453
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're actual licensed bartenders.

185
00:12:22,433 --> 00:12:22,994
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, okay.

186
00:12:23,054 --> 00:12:25,715
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you can adjust that then you can check that box.

187
00:12:27,994 --> 00:12:28,234
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

188
00:12:28,575 --> 00:12:29,335
[SPEAKER_03]: On the second.

189
00:12:32,177 --> 00:12:34,219
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the others are TIP certified.

190
00:12:38,162 --> 00:12:44,827
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm finding is, as I'm trying to hire TIP-certified people, that a lot of people let their TIP certification expire.

191
00:12:46,148 --> 00:12:51,492
[SPEAKER_01]: They're trained, but they don't actually have it, so it makes it harder to find people.

192
00:12:51,572 --> 00:12:57,997
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's a really good way of protecting ourselves by having someone who probably knows what they're doing.

193
00:12:59,348 --> 00:13:02,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, when you have 100 people, it's better to have a licensed bartender.

194
00:13:02,911 --> 00:13:09,977
[SPEAKER_03]: So, if these are licensed bartenders, I think you should just check that off.

195
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:13,460
[SPEAKER_03]: who will be serving the alcohol, yeah.

196
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,340
[SPEAKER_03]: It says event staff volunteer.

197
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:24,703
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so the people that will be selling it, it's the Revelry Norland's Cuisine food truck.

198
00:13:24,723 --> 00:13:29,885
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing the catering there, and it's their bartenders.

199
00:13:32,665 --> 00:13:35,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so then, oh yeah, go ahead, Bob.

200
00:13:35,386 --> 00:13:36,727
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, go ahead, Ben, I'm sorry.

201
00:13:36,767 --> 00:13:40,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, so then they're actually the catering company

202
00:13:41,552 --> 00:13:48,795
[SPEAKER_03]: In theory, they could be the one getting the liquor license if they're the one providing the alcohol.

203
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:53,056
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm buying the alcohol and they're serving it.

204
00:13:53,076 --> 00:13:54,337
[SPEAKER_01]: They're serving it.

205
00:13:54,397 --> 00:13:56,918
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm paying them to serve it.

206
00:13:58,338 --> 00:13:59,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, OK.

207
00:13:59,078 --> 00:14:02,360
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just like hiring a bartender and you've stocked the bar.

208
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:08,282
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think you just would put that that is a licensed bartender serving the drinks then.

209
00:14:08,802 --> 00:14:08,902
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

210
00:14:09,571 --> 00:14:11,433
[SPEAKER_03]: if they are, in fact, a licensed bartender.

211
00:14:11,994 --> 00:14:12,234
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

212
00:14:14,917 --> 00:14:15,417
[SPEAKER_01]: Understood.

213
00:14:15,858 --> 00:14:19,582
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that something that I need to resubmit the paperwork for?

214
00:14:19,602 --> 00:14:22,144
[SPEAKER_01]: Or can you make that change, Daria?

215
00:14:22,485 --> 00:14:23,906
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm making that change now.

216
00:14:24,087 --> 00:14:25,228
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, thank you so much.

217
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:29,272
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll put a checkmark, that licensed bartender.

218
00:14:29,873 --> 00:14:30,073
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

219
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:51,650
[SPEAKER_00]: Just for future reference, Hendrick, you may want to talk to this caterer, because if they've got a state license for catering, they're allowed to bring their own alcohol in, and you don't even have to appear before us.

220
00:14:52,211 --> 00:14:58,534
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing they're required to do is notify us and the police department within 48 hours of the event.

221
00:15:02,103 --> 00:15:09,249
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's kind of like, I don't know if they give you a cut of whatever comes in or what deals are made.

222
00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:18,677
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it's there is such a thing that these caterers have a state caterers license through the ABCC.

223
00:15:19,338 --> 00:15:22,620
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's the case, it just save you a lot of aggravation and everything else.

224
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,001
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

225
00:15:23,561 --> 00:15:24,682
[SPEAKER_00]: You just may want to check with them.

226
00:15:24,702 --> 00:15:26,524
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I'm new at this.

227
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:36,777
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I mean, if you're paying for them and for their service and they have the license, it's kind of, you know.

228
00:15:38,297 --> 00:15:40,958
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's something for you to look into if you like.

229
00:15:40,998 --> 00:15:43,299
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and they're only doing one of the events, right?

230
00:15:43,579 --> 00:15:45,499
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not, yeah, so.

231
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:45,680
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

232
00:15:47,423 --> 00:16:13,546
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of that's what I was saying in theory they could have but I think if you're just getting it for all three events sort of makes sense the way you're doing it so I think you just clean that up then that's more accurate when we approve like a hundred person event and it says no real bartender there that's sort of like a you know you know a thing that but it so we'd like to see that there is a real bartender and there is in fact so that's good so I just make sure that that's all that's accurate.

233
00:16:17,272 --> 00:16:19,154
[SPEAKER_00]: Ben, thank you.

234
00:16:19,594 --> 00:16:25,619
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, Ben, if you want to make a motion, we can do all three days at once.

235
00:16:25,739 --> 00:16:28,142
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have it in front of you, I can do it.

236
00:16:28,982 --> 00:16:29,763
[SPEAKER_03]: I have them right here.

237
00:16:30,724 --> 00:16:41,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so I will make a motion to approve the one-day license for the dates of March 2nd, March 6th, March 19th,

238
00:16:43,118 --> 00:17:01,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, for the, um, Arts Collaborative Medford, located at 162 Mystic Ave, Medford, um, for the three events just described, uh, pending some minor adjustments to the application for licensed bartender and address.

239
00:17:03,854 --> 00:17:04,174
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

240
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:04,475
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.

241
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:05,936
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll second the motion.

242
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:07,157
[SPEAKER_00]: All those in favor?

243
00:17:08,158 --> 00:17:08,298
[SPEAKER_00]: Aye.

244
00:17:10,259 --> 00:17:11,040
[SPEAKER_00]: All those opposed?

245
00:17:12,514 --> 00:17:14,196
[SPEAKER_00]: Hearing and seeing none, the AIs have it.

246
00:17:14,676 --> 00:17:15,557
[SPEAKER_00]: You're all set, Hendrik.

247
00:17:16,138 --> 00:17:16,559
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

248
00:17:17,239 --> 00:17:18,140
[SPEAKER_00]: Good luck with your events.

249
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:18,841
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

250
00:17:18,861 --> 00:17:20,023
[SPEAKER_00]: Sound like a good time.

251
00:17:20,543 --> 00:17:24,087
[SPEAKER_01]: The Mardi Gras thing is definitely something to check out.

252
00:17:25,028 --> 00:17:25,749
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, cool.

253
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,371
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

254
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:30,194
[SPEAKER_01]: The guy from New Orleans starts at six.

255
00:17:31,427 --> 00:17:31,768
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

256
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:32,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, cool.

257
00:17:33,671 --> 00:17:42,445
[SPEAKER_03]: And Andrew, you have one of the best zoom setups here with the microphone and it's like a like a podcaster.

258
00:17:42,685 --> 00:17:44,488
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm, I'm an audio engineer.

259
00:17:44,508 --> 00:17:44,568
[SPEAKER_01]: And

260
00:17:46,691 --> 00:18:01,466
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done a lot of these setups, especially during the pandemic, setting up Zoom for CEOs and fancy types.

261
00:18:03,328 --> 00:18:06,431
[SPEAKER_01]: Wanted to get them to see what it could look like.

262
00:18:08,725 --> 00:18:09,005
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great.

263
00:18:09,025 --> 00:18:10,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it looks good.

264
00:18:11,027 --> 00:18:11,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice job.

265
00:18:12,227 --> 00:18:12,588
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

266
00:18:12,768 --> 00:18:13,828
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, best of luck.

267
00:18:14,309 --> 00:18:15,089
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.

268
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:16,490
[SPEAKER_01]: Good luck with your events.

269
00:18:17,071 --> 00:18:17,871
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, thanks.

270
00:18:19,793 --> 00:18:28,438
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and I think the last thing on the agenda is the Buns House, Frozen Boston, Inc.

271
00:18:28,478 --> 00:18:29,839
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have a representative?

272
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:31,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

273
00:18:31,781 --> 00:18:33,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman.

274
00:18:33,062 --> 00:18:37,905
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Attorney Russell Chin, and I'm an attorney representing the applicant

[SPEAKER_02]: She's been logging in or trying to log in.

277
00:19:03,665 --> 00:19:05,806
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if she's still with us now.

278
00:19:07,226 --> 00:19:12,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Based on that contact, I apologize for if she's not with us here.

279
00:19:14,629 --> 00:19:19,431
[SPEAKER_00]: That won't be a problem, as long as Mr. Ping is here, that's fine.

280
00:19:20,051 --> 00:19:24,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Mr. Wangping is in my office, but in my conference room on this call.

281
00:19:26,934 --> 00:19:27,854
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we see him there.

282
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:35,161
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, and let's see.

283
00:19:37,483 --> 00:19:38,424
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Chin.

284
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:42,868
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, Mr. Chin.

285
00:19:44,936 --> 00:19:54,940
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the opportunity to spend some time looking over this application, and it looks great to me.

286
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,981
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I went through it.

287
00:19:59,161 --> 00:20:03,883
[SPEAKER_00]: All the boxes were checked of what needed to be done.

288
00:20:05,903 --> 00:20:14,586
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the bank statements and everything and the leases and all that good stuff that you're required to have.

289
00:20:17,127 --> 00:20:24,149
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the very few applications we've seen that didn't need correction, in my opinion.

290
00:20:24,249 --> 00:20:27,770
[SPEAKER_00]: But Ben, I'm not sure if you came across anything.

291
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:29,651
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, it looked-.

292
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:31,051
[SPEAKER_00]: Bobby would usually find it.

293
00:20:33,656 --> 00:20:35,317
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of like the watchdog, I guess.

294
00:20:35,417 --> 00:20:35,857
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

295
00:20:35,897 --> 00:20:37,118
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, it looked great.

296
00:20:37,739 --> 00:20:38,780
[SPEAKER_00]: It's looking good.

297
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:43,864
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just looking at it again.

298
00:20:44,564 --> 00:20:48,948
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, take a quick look over here, you know, because like, you're going to miss something.

299
00:20:49,008 --> 00:20:53,091
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, um, you know, even so.

300
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:54,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

301
00:20:54,372 --> 00:20:55,113
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's one.

302
00:20:55,173 --> 00:20:55,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

303
00:20:57,528 --> 00:21:08,093
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so the sale price is 130,000 purchase price and new lease is in place or being taken over.

304
00:21:08,113 --> 00:21:16,877
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that's, are they taking over the lease or is it a new lease?

305
00:21:17,633 --> 00:21:18,633
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it's a new lease.

306
00:21:18,673 --> 00:21:23,855
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't recall whether it's an assignment here or whether it's a new lease.

307
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:27,217
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have that open on my screen.

308
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you need to know that?

309
00:21:30,358 --> 00:21:32,499
[SPEAKER_02]: I can try to find it.

310
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:37,481
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it's even, if it's totally critical.

311
00:21:38,101 --> 00:21:38,841
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lease.

312
00:21:39,281 --> 00:21:42,343
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's sort of between you guys.

313
00:21:42,983 --> 00:21:45,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there any changes being made to the restaurant itself?

314
00:21:47,374 --> 00:21:53,957
[SPEAKER_02]: I think beyond cosmetic, there is no structural change that is contemplated.

315
00:21:56,138 --> 00:22:02,401
[SPEAKER_02]: This gentleman sold and closed his restaurant that was located in Everett under the same name.

316
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:11,085
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's now going to operate in Medford under the same Buns House name.

317
00:22:12,646 --> 00:22:16,468
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's just looking for the baron wine to accompany his menu.

318
00:22:18,923 --> 00:22:19,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

319
00:22:19,143 --> 00:22:19,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

320
00:22:19,303 --> 00:22:19,684
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.

321
00:22:23,407 --> 00:22:38,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, um, no, it's, uh, I don't, I, it's, you know, it's not really reinventing the wheel because this was, uh, the chili garden or, you know, right before.

322
00:22:39,481 --> 00:22:39,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

323
00:22:39,921 --> 00:22:44,425
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, it seems like it's the same, it's the same setup and it's the same.

324
00:22:45,795 --> 00:22:47,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of everything, just new owners.

325
00:22:47,618 --> 00:22:54,068
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't have any questions and it looks like the application has everything we need.

326
00:22:56,528 --> 00:23:02,312
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you brought up a good point, Ben, asking if there were any structural changes or anything.

327
00:23:02,332 --> 00:23:15,943
[SPEAKER_00]: And where it is only wine and malt, I know that there was not a actual bar in that business.

328
00:23:16,303 --> 00:23:23,188
[SPEAKER_00]: They basically, if you ordered a beer or a glass of wine, they'd just bring it over from behind the counter type of thing.

329
00:23:24,129 --> 00:23:25,250
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, as long as

330
00:23:26,728 --> 00:23:30,809
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, like Ben asked, there's no major structural changes.

331
00:23:32,049 --> 00:23:32,930
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all good with it.

332
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:36,571
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, uh, yeah, it looks fine to me.

333
00:23:36,631 --> 00:23:37,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Adding a bar.

334
00:23:37,851 --> 00:23:38,051
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

335
00:23:38,371 --> 00:23:38,531
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

336
00:23:38,551 --> 00:23:39,732
[SPEAKER_00]: I like adding a bar.

337
00:23:39,872 --> 00:23:40,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

338
00:23:40,572 --> 00:23:46,533
[SPEAKER_00]: Changing the layout where the liquor is going to be stored or served, uh, or any of that stuff, you know?

339
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:50,134
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, no, this, this looks fine.

340
00:23:52,415 --> 00:23:52,515
[SPEAKER_00]: Um,

341
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:56,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and then there's the entertainment licenses that go with this.

342
00:23:56,886 --> 00:23:59,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what we should be looking at next, Bobby?

343
00:24:00,588 --> 00:24:00,928
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

344
00:24:02,469 --> 00:24:04,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Not to jump ahead, but I just was wondering.

345
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:05,670
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's fine.

346
00:24:07,911 --> 00:24:12,173
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I kind of reviewed that as well, and it all seemed okay.

347
00:24:12,193 --> 00:24:13,574
[SPEAKER_00]: I did notice that

348
00:24:17,492 --> 00:24:29,636
[SPEAKER_00]: The three different portions of the entertainment license were signed off by the police, the fire, and the building, and the Board of Health.

349
00:24:30,216 --> 00:24:42,020
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I'm seeing is here you're only going to be having TV entertainment by devices, which I believe was two or three devices in there somewhere.

350
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,901
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, two TVs.

351
00:24:45,141 --> 00:24:45,761
[SPEAKER_00]: Two TVs.

352
00:24:46,714 --> 00:24:51,117
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's not going to be any karaoke, live entertainment or any of that stuff?

353
00:24:51,737 --> 00:24:51,977
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

354
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:52,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

355
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:53,158
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

356
00:24:53,318 --> 00:24:53,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

357
00:24:53,758 --> 00:25:02,523
[SPEAKER_02]: The TVs will likely be used for menus as well as for just the television, normal television shows.

358
00:25:07,266 --> 00:25:07,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

359
00:25:08,326 --> 00:25:09,747
[SPEAKER_03]: That seems about right.

360
00:25:09,767 --> 00:25:10,107
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

361
00:25:12,008 --> 00:25:12,989
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks good to me as well.

362
00:25:14,453 --> 00:25:18,834
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Ben, would you, well, maybe we should approve these separately.

363
00:25:19,954 --> 00:25:20,274
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

364
00:25:20,694 --> 00:25:33,297
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll approve the restaurant first, liquor license, beer and wine, beer and malt, wine and malt license, and then we'll do the entertainment license separate.

365
00:25:34,817 --> 00:25:35,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

366
00:25:35,437 --> 00:25:35,757
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

367
00:25:35,837 --> 00:25:38,218
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess I can make the motion here.

368
00:25:38,978 --> 00:25:39,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

369
00:25:41,427 --> 00:25:58,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so I'm going to make a motion to approve the new, the application for wine and malt, the new license for the entity named Frozen Boston Inc.

370
00:25:58,456 --> 00:25:59,816
[SPEAKER_03]: at 41 Riverside Ave.

371
00:25:59,917 --> 00:26:09,682
[SPEAKER_03]: in Medford, replacing the Chili Garden, the existing restaurant Chili Garden, approving this

372
00:26:12,004 --> 00:26:13,665
[SPEAKER_03]: this application that we have in front of us.

373
00:26:15,625 --> 00:26:16,025
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

374
00:26:16,365 --> 00:26:18,146
[SPEAKER_00]: I second that motion.

375
00:26:18,366 --> 00:26:19,226
[SPEAKER_00]: All those in favor?

376
00:26:19,826 --> 00:26:20,006
[SPEAKER_00]: Aye.

377
00:26:21,827 --> 00:26:22,247
[SPEAKER_00]: Aye.

378
00:26:22,467 --> 00:26:23,367
[SPEAKER_00]: All those opposed?

379
00:26:24,608 --> 00:26:28,929
[SPEAKER_00]: Hearing and seeing none, your application has been approved.

380
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:33,570
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Ding's application has been approved.

381
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,271
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.

382
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:43,207
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so the entertainment license.

383
00:26:43,447 --> 00:26:46,909
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have an entertainment license in front of us.

384
00:26:47,109 --> 00:26:53,372
[SPEAKER_03]: I will make a motion to approve the application for the entertainment license for premises.

385
00:26:56,345 --> 00:27:15,389
[SPEAKER_03]: which is all filled out here, signed by all departments, city departments, board of health, inspectional services, fire and police, as it is presented for two TVs on premises.

386
00:27:16,949 --> 00:27:18,449
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I'll second that motion.

387
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:19,770
[SPEAKER_00]: All those in favor?

388
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:21,070
[SPEAKER_00]: Aye.

389
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:21,470
[SPEAKER_00]: Aye.

390
00:27:22,703 --> 00:27:23,463
[SPEAKER_00]: All those opposed?

391
00:27:23,883 --> 00:27:28,804
[SPEAKER_00]: Hearing and seeing none, the ayes have it, and the motion's been approved.

392
00:27:31,905 --> 00:27:32,985
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Deng, you're all set.

393
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:34,786
[SPEAKER_00]: Best of luck with your new business.

394
00:27:36,066 --> 00:27:39,627
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mr. Attorney Chen, I appreciate.

395
00:27:39,807 --> 00:27:40,907
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice job on this.

396
00:27:41,707 --> 00:27:42,547
[SPEAKER_00]: No problems at all.

397
00:27:43,268 --> 00:27:43,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Terrific.

398
00:27:43,688 --> 00:27:46,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and members of the board.

399
00:27:46,108 --> 00:27:47,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate your time.

400
00:27:47,769 --> 00:27:48,149
[SPEAKER_00]: All righty.

401
00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:48,969
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

402
00:27:53,844 --> 00:27:54,244
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

403
00:27:55,185 --> 00:27:59,066
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, started out a little rocky, but we got through it okay.

404
00:27:59,186 --> 00:27:59,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

405
00:28:00,127 --> 00:28:01,147
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew you'd be okay.

406
00:28:03,088 --> 00:28:04,648
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, oh, man.

407
00:28:05,329 --> 00:28:08,050
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, I couldn't get this thing unmuted.

408
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:12,372
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just keep telling, every time I try to unmute it, it'd say, log in.

409
00:28:12,392 --> 00:28:15,413
[SPEAKER_00]: I log in, open my pad, then it says, we're going to say,

410
00:28:16,053 --> 00:28:19,055
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to text you a code or email you a code.

411
00:28:19,475 --> 00:28:20,596
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to fill in the code.

412
00:28:20,976 --> 00:28:25,899
[SPEAKER_00]: I put the code in when Daria came back on, and it said that it was the wrong code.

413
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,461
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to log in again, put my password in again.

414
00:28:29,681 --> 00:28:30,742
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent me another code.

415
00:28:31,222 --> 00:28:34,584
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I finally wound up getting on, but it worked.

416
00:28:35,945 --> 00:28:37,586
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all good.

417
00:28:39,187 --> 00:28:42,909
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I'm kind of wondering if Ocean State might have

418
00:28:45,387 --> 00:28:55,050
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they've had three or four different applications and managers, and it seems to me they kind of go through a big turnover over there.

419
00:28:55,951 --> 00:28:57,711
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wondering if that might have been the case.

420
00:28:57,791 --> 00:29:01,813
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe this new applicant might have quit already.

421
00:29:02,753 --> 00:29:05,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I can't even, I cannot even remember.

422
00:29:05,194 --> 00:29:08,015
[SPEAKER_05]: I was trying to search my email because I swear.

423
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:10,791
[SPEAKER_05]: But then, I don't know, I don't know.

424
00:29:10,851 --> 00:29:13,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes when they don't, I don't know, I gotta look through my emails.

425
00:29:14,494 --> 00:29:23,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Because sometimes when they don't follow up with me, I receive an application and it's like, I know I talked to them, but I can't remember if I sent it to them, send them the link or not.

426
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:24,982
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's like, please follow up with me.

427
00:29:25,042 --> 00:29:26,283
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't keep it all.

428
00:29:26,323 --> 00:29:26,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

429
00:29:27,844 --> 00:29:28,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's on them.

430
00:29:28,664 --> 00:29:31,006
[SPEAKER_05]: You know that there's a meeting in February, just follow up with me.

431
00:29:31,066 --> 00:29:35,149
[SPEAKER_05]: So like, if I don't send you the link, just make sure you follow up.

432
00:29:35,449 --> 00:29:35,710
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

433
00:29:36,668 --> 00:29:41,290
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, they will that I was going to do before the meeting, but I didn't have time.

434
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:42,831
[SPEAKER_00]: I got tied up with something else.

435
00:29:43,111 --> 00:29:43,631
[SPEAKER_00]: I, um.

436
00:29:44,391 --> 00:29:48,453
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to check the last 2 or 3 months when they were supposed to come.

437
00:29:48,473 --> 00:29:52,455
[SPEAKER_00]: They were supposed to look like, see if it was the same manager.

438
00:29:53,301 --> 00:29:56,642
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking they're turning it over real quick.

439
00:29:56,662 --> 00:29:56,802
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

440
00:29:56,822 --> 00:30:02,143
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the one that they did for December, why they did it is because something happened with the manager.

441
00:30:02,183 --> 00:30:03,283
[SPEAKER_05]: So they got a new one.

442
00:30:03,743 --> 00:30:12,965
[SPEAKER_05]: But when I told them, are you attending for the January one because we were on the meeting, they didn't show up.

443
00:30:13,685 --> 00:30:15,805
[SPEAKER_05]: She just said, we're not going to be able to make it to this one.

444
00:30:15,905 --> 00:30:16,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Put us on February.

445
00:30:16,926 --> 00:30:18,226
[SPEAKER_05]: But I can't remember past that.

446
00:30:19,546 --> 00:30:26,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I know they sent me the application, because I sent it to you guys, but I cannot remember if we talked, if we did not talk.

447
00:30:26,928 --> 00:30:28,629
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all like a mush now.

448
00:30:28,649 --> 00:30:32,270
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's fine.

449
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:33,190
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a problem.

450
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:35,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Thinking about it, did I even hear from them?

451
00:30:35,391 --> 00:30:40,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I know I followed up with them a couple times, but I can't remember if I was chasing them down for this meeting or not.

452
00:30:42,012 --> 00:30:43,133
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, according to their

453
00:30:44,643 --> 00:30:51,047
[SPEAKER_00]: their application, they're paying the $200 fee to the ABCC and I think $100 to the city as well.

454
00:30:52,948 --> 00:30:55,910
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, you know, who knows?

455
00:30:56,990 --> 00:31:06,376
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes up again, we'll kind of compare notes and see if it's the same manager or, I mean, if it's different managers in different applications.

456
00:31:06,976 --> 00:31:09,218
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know the last one was- They have to pay every single

457
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:38,345
[SPEAKER_00]: time right yeah if it's different i don't know yeah yeah no this one you know it was never approved the previous it's you know it's i don't know i don't know how to handle it but that's what it is yeah next month is going to be hopefully our normal schedule so i'll just let them know here's the april's um zoom link just make sure you attend that's it yeah

458
00:31:39,842 --> 00:31:49,828
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I think they've got something next month to the penalty that was imposed by the ABCC.

459
00:31:51,048 --> 00:31:55,491
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not responsible for going to remove the license, correct?

460
00:31:55,811 --> 00:31:57,372
[SPEAKER_00]: I sent it to the police, so.

461
00:31:59,997 --> 00:32:03,140
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, because the ABCC gave that order.

462
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:06,682
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we basically stay out of it at this point.

463
00:32:07,763 --> 00:32:08,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's what I thought.

464
00:32:08,744 --> 00:32:10,565
[SPEAKER_03]: That was just an FYI to us, right?

465
00:32:11,286 --> 00:32:11,626
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

466
00:32:12,087 --> 00:32:18,051
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I think maybe just like Daria did, she sent it to the police and

467
00:32:19,052 --> 00:32:22,613
[SPEAKER_00]: whether they want to go to make sure that the alcohol was put away.

468
00:32:22,633 --> 00:32:25,814
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even think it should be displayed.

469
00:32:25,834 --> 00:32:28,655
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is displayed, it should be sectioned off.

470
00:32:30,375 --> 00:32:36,797
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, the cashiers know that they're not going to be able to sell it.

471
00:32:37,077 --> 00:32:42,018
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know what ABCC has for requirements about posting signs in the windows.

472
00:32:42,038 --> 00:32:43,319
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't know either.

473
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:48,216
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that's I think it's out of our hands at this point where it's.

474
00:32:48,576 --> 00:32:49,057
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.

475
00:32:49,437 --> 00:32:49,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

476
00:32:50,098 --> 00:32:50,779
[SPEAKER_00]: Seems like it is.

477
00:32:53,021 --> 00:32:53,121
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

478
00:32:54,958 --> 00:32:56,919
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, I think we're good, Darry.

479
00:32:56,939 --> 00:32:58,660
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a chance to look over that?

480
00:32:59,241 --> 00:33:02,783
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking with Darry earlier.

481
00:33:03,543 --> 00:33:14,389
[SPEAKER_00]: What I think we might want to consider is sending out like a quarterly newsletter to all the licensees, because we have a lot of things coming up.

482
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:19,832
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do another annual ABCC meeting.

483
00:33:21,193 --> 00:33:23,634
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason for that is things change.

484
00:33:24,855 --> 00:33:29,677
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was talking to Ralph, and he says they have some new things they like to talk about.

485
00:33:30,017 --> 00:33:40,502
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, you may want to, if you're going to do the quarterly newsletter, just put in there that keep your eyes open sometime the end of August, beginning of September.

486
00:33:41,222 --> 00:33:43,023
[SPEAKER_00]: We're planning another blah, blah, blah.

487
00:33:45,671 --> 00:33:52,955
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just received, Jerry received something from, I think it was Sophie Greenbaum about the TIP certification.

488
00:33:54,175 --> 00:34:01,919
[SPEAKER_00]: They're offering it for free again through this whole, I guess, Medford Malden area thing.

489
00:34:02,439 --> 00:34:06,341
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe we can include that in the newsletter stating that it's available.

490
00:34:07,262 --> 00:34:13,985
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them the link, the application, reply ASAP because it fills up quick and it's free.

491
00:34:14,005 --> 00:34:15,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Bob, will you write that newsletter?

492
00:34:15,942 --> 00:34:16,362
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sorry.

493
00:34:16,583 --> 00:34:17,584
[SPEAKER_00]: Will you write the newsletter?

494
00:34:18,144 --> 00:34:19,786
[SPEAKER_00]: So who would do it?

495
00:34:19,826 --> 00:34:24,230
[SPEAKER_00]: And it had a draft and sent it to Daria.

496
00:34:25,051 --> 00:34:26,472
[SPEAKER_00]: She's got to check it out and stuff.

497
00:34:26,652 --> 00:34:35,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I started to work on it, like lay it out and stuff like that on Canva just to see like what it would look like and if we can even send it out.

498
00:34:36,341 --> 00:34:38,904
[SPEAKER_05]: So it looks more like a newsletter type of thing.

499
00:34:40,585 --> 00:34:44,187
[SPEAKER_05]: I just haven't had the chance to catch up with it this week because I started last week.

500
00:34:45,808 --> 00:34:51,152
[SPEAKER_05]: So my plan is hopefully work on it today, tomorrow, and then send it to you guys out.

501
00:34:51,192 --> 00:34:51,892
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have it.

502
00:34:52,313 --> 00:34:52,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

503
00:34:52,833 --> 00:34:53,914
[SPEAKER_05]: And send it out next week.

504
00:34:54,674 --> 00:34:55,515
[SPEAKER_05]: If you guys are.

505
00:34:56,035 --> 00:34:58,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm very much in favor of the newsletter.

506
00:34:58,297 --> 00:35:02,739
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's just a good communication source to be license holders.

507
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,901
[SPEAKER_03]: It it shows that we're

508
00:35:05,521 --> 00:35:10,902
[SPEAKER_03]: giving them fair advance notice on things and setting good expectations, you know.

509
00:35:11,623 --> 00:35:12,623
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a really good thing.

510
00:35:13,783 --> 00:35:14,323
[SPEAKER_00]: I do too.

511
00:35:14,703 --> 00:35:28,467
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, what I was talking to Daria about too was we're going to be requesting, I'd like to be requesting a copy of everyone's common vigilance license because

512
00:35:29,647 --> 00:35:34,929
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people are coming like that new establishment that came in where the porch used to be.

513
00:35:34,949 --> 00:35:39,471
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a question of hours about serving with a liquor license.

514
00:35:39,511 --> 00:35:41,772
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something different than a vigilance license.

515
00:35:41,792 --> 00:35:50,915
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had Daria get the vigilance license, and I told her just grant it to whatever the hours are on the vigilance license, because that's all they can serve.

516
00:35:50,935 --> 00:35:51,716
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that keeps coming up.

517
00:35:54,632 --> 00:36:03,056
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing is the city never adopted Chapter 138, Section 33A and 33B, which in a nutshell is allowing a place to stay open until

518
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:24,309
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, on secular days, yeah, till 2 a.m., if need be, 1 a.m., 2 a.m.

519
00:36:25,991 --> 00:36:26,651
[SPEAKER_00]: on Sundays.

520
00:36:28,117 --> 00:36:34,998
[SPEAKER_00]: because of New Year's Eve, Memorial Day, and there was one other holiday, I forget which one it was.

521
00:36:35,799 --> 00:36:41,220
[SPEAKER_00]: But those are the three days they're allowed to stay open automatically, those extra hours.

522
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:50,882
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one was they're going to roll back the hours one hour earlier for Sundays.

523
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:57,063
[SPEAKER_00]: So if a place wants to do a brunch instead of, right now all the Medford licenses say,

524
00:36:58,063 --> 00:36:58,403
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 o'clock.

525
00:36:59,644 --> 00:37:16,853
[SPEAKER_00]: But the law reads in Chapter 138, Section 12, which are all liquor licenses, that no one can stop a licensee from serving 11 a.m.

526
00:37:17,333 --> 00:37:18,333
[SPEAKER_00]: to 11 p.m.

527
00:37:18,674 --> 00:37:19,514
[SPEAKER_00]: seven days a week.

528
00:37:20,815 --> 00:37:26,457
[SPEAKER_00]: So what this is going to do, 33B, is going to allow them to go to 10 a.m.

529
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:29,184
[SPEAKER_00]: to 11 p.m.

530
00:37:31,529 --> 00:37:33,733
[SPEAKER_00]: just in case they want to do brunch or whatever.

531
00:37:33,773 --> 00:37:40,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think it's fair for, you know, Great American Beer Hall kind of places as well to, you know, want to

532
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:43,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

533
00:37:43,731 --> 00:37:45,913
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, for any brunch place, really.

534
00:37:45,933 --> 00:37:47,094
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.

535
00:37:47,734 --> 00:37:53,278
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody's license will be according to what their common vic says.

536
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:58,101
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, maybe- Who sets the common vic?

537
00:37:58,962 --> 00:38:01,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Or like, who approves the common vic?

538
00:38:01,103 --> 00:38:01,484
[SPEAKER_00]: City clerk.

539
00:38:02,745 --> 00:38:03,545
[SPEAKER_00]: City clerk does.

540
00:38:03,565 --> 00:38:06,808
[SPEAKER_05]: It technically goes through the city, well, it goes through city council.

541
00:38:08,097 --> 00:38:10,419
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's the city council who approves the Common Vic.

542
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Do they not just all have the same?

543
00:38:13,122 --> 00:38:16,886
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I want to start a restaurant tomorrow, do I have to?

544
00:38:17,226 --> 00:38:18,467
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to go through the city clerks.

545
00:38:19,368 --> 00:38:25,434
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was actually talking to, do you remember attorney Sylvia Guzman from December's meeting?

546
00:38:25,734 --> 00:38:27,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Or I think it was.

547
00:38:27,295 --> 00:38:27,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

548
00:38:29,269 --> 00:38:30,470
[SPEAKER_05]: she was helping out Yoki.

549
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:33,152
[SPEAKER_05]: She was doing the transfer for Yoki.

550
00:38:33,732 --> 00:38:44,380
[SPEAKER_05]: So her and I were talking today, because she didn't realize that, or I don't know what happened, but it doesn't seem like she got a common VIC for the new owner.

551
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:47,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Seems like it's still under the old owner.

552
00:38:48,683 --> 00:38:57,249
[SPEAKER_05]: So she was saying that in Boston and Chelsea, Somerville, whatever, it's streamlined through the license commission.

553
00:38:58,358 --> 00:38:59,880
[SPEAKER_05]: which is what I keep hearing as well.

554
00:39:01,582 --> 00:39:12,377
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, usually it's the License Commission who hears like violations on the Common Vic, on the liquor license, it's not usually, City Council is usually not involved.

555
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:15,941
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I kind of,

556
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:23,182
[SPEAKER_05]: I was kind of like, it's interesting because I've heard that before that where license commission usually is the one that does everything.

557
00:39:23,262 --> 00:39:26,003
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like divided between other departments.

558
00:39:26,183 --> 00:39:26,744
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

559
00:39:26,824 --> 00:39:28,524
[SPEAKER_05]: So think about it.

560
00:39:28,564 --> 00:39:31,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Common Vig goes hand in hand with the liquor license.

561
00:39:31,526 --> 00:39:41,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Like they can't, a restaurant cannot start serving alcohol at 10 if their food is not- Available.

562
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:42,430
[SPEAKER_05]: Is not served at 10 a.m.

563
00:39:43,809 --> 00:39:48,012
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like, it really, we should be really more hands-on.

564
00:39:48,713 --> 00:39:57,659
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we're starting to get to that point, but it's still, you know, it's just, I feel like we need to have a better streamline.

565
00:39:57,679 --> 00:40:04,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I don't think I even realized how common Vic is very important to the liquor license portion.

566
00:40:04,664 --> 00:40:10,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, but also I'm kind of understanding more throughout each time we talk about this.

567
00:40:12,207 --> 00:40:12,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

568
00:40:12,507 --> 00:40:16,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Common Vic only applied to liquor, to liquor licensing.

569
00:40:16,628 --> 00:40:17,448
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not necessarily.

570
00:40:17,468 --> 00:40:18,329
[SPEAKER_03]: For anywhere.

571
00:40:18,769 --> 00:40:19,669
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's anywhere.

572
00:40:19,689 --> 00:40:21,969
[SPEAKER_05]: Dunkin Donuts, they don't serve food.

573
00:40:21,989 --> 00:40:23,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, does Dunkin Donuts have one?

574
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:25,210
[SPEAKER_05]: They do, yeah.

575
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:28,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody that serves food needs to have a Common Victor license.

576
00:40:29,791 --> 00:40:32,392
[SPEAKER_05]: So would they come to us for a Common Victor license?

577
00:40:32,432 --> 00:40:33,232
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, no.

578
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:36,553
[SPEAKER_05]: They, well, I don't think so.

579
00:40:36,613 --> 00:40:39,154
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so.

580
00:40:39,194 --> 00:40:40,414
[SPEAKER_03]: But I meant if you streamlined it.

581
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:41,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

582
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,181
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's a good question.

583
00:40:43,261 --> 00:40:43,801
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

584
00:40:44,281 --> 00:40:50,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Because every time I've talked to somebody, they always mention Common Vic and liquor, not just Common Vic or liquor separately.

585
00:40:50,603 --> 00:40:52,243
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

586
00:40:52,563 --> 00:40:58,685
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know what would be a different process for specifically like places that don't serve liquor.

587
00:40:58,705 --> 00:41:00,165
[SPEAKER_05]: That's actually a good point.

588
00:41:00,785 --> 00:41:01,606
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't think about that.

589
00:41:01,766 --> 00:41:02,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Good job.

590
00:41:02,026 --> 00:41:10,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I just want to know what our parameters are for the hours that we can allow or if we even have any say on it, because that seems like it gets confusing.

591
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:12,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's what gets confusing.

592
00:41:12,153 --> 00:41:25,182
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think what we can do is just I can, you know, I keep talking to Rich from City Clerk's office to kind of get to the bottom of like, you know, how CommonVic works with liquor license and what are the parameters?

593
00:41:25,202 --> 00:41:27,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, do we need to involve city council on this?

594
00:41:27,664 --> 00:41:30,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we not need to get, you know, council involved on this?

595
00:41:32,187 --> 00:41:39,673
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think the most important thing is that we've got to keep looking over the ordinances for the city because

596
00:41:40,572 --> 00:41:40,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

597
00:41:41,593 --> 00:41:50,840
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like there's a lot that's we think is an ordinance, but it's not an ordinance or like, it's not necessarily for that or whatever.

598
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,702
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it's just, I feel like we need to kind of.

599
00:41:54,378 --> 00:41:55,698
[SPEAKER_05]: work together and figure that all out.

600
00:41:56,298 --> 00:41:58,499
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I think at the end of the day, it comes down to the ordinance.

601
00:41:58,579 --> 00:42:00,659
[SPEAKER_05]: It depends on what our ordinances say.

602
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:08,221
[SPEAKER_05]: So if our ordinances say that we have to go to city council for this, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, then that's the way we have to do it.

603
00:42:08,281 --> 00:42:14,903
[SPEAKER_05]: If it says, if it doesn't say that anywhere, then I think it should just, I don't know, we need to figure it out, I guess.

604
00:42:15,874 --> 00:42:23,838
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of seeing it, and I kind of think it was in, like, the rules and regulations of the commission from the city.

605
00:42:23,858 --> 00:42:32,423
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if if that was the place I saw it, but I do remember seeing something about it for extended hours.

606
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:35,684
[SPEAKER_00]: It had to go before the city council.

607
00:42:37,886 --> 00:42:42,168
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, if if it's kind of like a.

608
00:42:45,218 --> 00:42:47,800
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, not a big deal type of thing.

609
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:53,082
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, maybe the hours for Carmen Vic can be changed.

610
00:42:54,283 --> 00:43:04,328
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Carmen Vic from, uh, well, the Carmen Vic is, I think on the porch was 7 a.m.

611
00:43:04,628 --> 00:43:06,649
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe till 11 p.m.

612
00:43:06,729 --> 00:43:07,669
[SPEAKER_00]: seven days a week.

613
00:43:08,229 --> 00:43:08,790
[SPEAKER_00]: On the porch?

614
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:09,170
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?

615
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:11,651
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not the porch, the establishment.

616
00:43:12,552 --> 00:43:13,152
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um,

617
00:43:14,568 --> 00:43:18,489
[SPEAKER_00]: When we look at it, you sent it to me, and I says, oh, seven days a week.

618
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:19,370
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, but wait a minute.

619
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:27,932
[SPEAKER_00]: Our liquor license is only going to go till noon on Sunday until 11 PM, because we haven't adopted 33B yet.

620
00:43:29,993 --> 00:43:35,034
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, we've got to get 33A and B adopted, and we've got to find out how to do that.

621
00:43:35,054 --> 00:43:37,175
[SPEAKER_05]: I am working on that.

622
00:43:37,295 --> 00:43:37,495
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

623
00:43:38,556 --> 00:43:39,716
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that,

624
00:43:44,135 --> 00:43:48,762
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we should have a meeting with all the department heads, uh, for the health building.

625
00:43:48,782 --> 00:43:52,687
[SPEAKER_00]: Fire police and.

626
00:43:53,889 --> 00:44:00,978
[SPEAKER_00]: And collect city clerk and say, okay, can we just use an overall balloon time?

627
00:44:03,177 --> 00:44:06,600
[SPEAKER_00]: that the Common Vic is good from 7 a.m.

628
00:44:07,541 --> 00:44:08,602
[SPEAKER_00]: well you can't say 7 a.m.

629
00:44:08,802 --> 00:44:18,812
[SPEAKER_00]: either because some people are open early for breakfast like Starbucks and things like that but have just a regular till 2 a.m.

630
00:44:20,033 --> 00:44:22,195
[SPEAKER_00]: not that everybody's gonna stay open that late

631
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:26,891
[SPEAKER_00]: But the one or two people that might want to stay open till 1 a.m.

632
00:44:26,971 --> 00:44:28,312
[SPEAKER_00]: or 2 a.m.

633
00:44:28,372 --> 00:44:38,536
[SPEAKER_00]: for some reason, get to after hours crowds or whatever, at least will be able to grant the license or deny the license at that point.

634
00:44:39,937 --> 00:44:47,780
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't do it because our hands are tied because the Common Vic is set for a certain time for some reason through the clerk's office.

635
00:44:48,872 --> 00:44:53,676
[SPEAKER_00]: When my daughter had the restaurant, I know I keep bringing it up, I used to do all of her paperwork.

636
00:44:53,736 --> 00:45:00,161
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd go into Boston City Hall, and when she was applying for it, they said, OK, what would you like for hours?

637
00:45:00,581 --> 00:45:01,202
[SPEAKER_00]: They asked me.

638
00:45:01,222 --> 00:45:03,564
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, I don't know.

639
00:45:03,764 --> 00:45:05,625
[SPEAKER_00]: She says, well, these are the max hours, aren't you?

640
00:45:05,725 --> 00:45:07,907
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you serving, did she ask if we were serving alcohol?

641
00:45:07,947 --> 00:45:08,287
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, no.

642
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:16,949
[SPEAKER_00]: And she says, okay, well, these are the hours, the max hours, you may as well take them, because whether you stay open or not doesn't make a difference.

643
00:45:17,209 --> 00:45:18,330
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, okay, that's fine.

644
00:45:19,070 --> 00:45:23,313
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did, I put them in it, whatever she suggested as the max.

645
00:45:24,393 --> 00:45:27,315
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if the city works the same way or what.

646
00:45:27,535 --> 00:45:29,736
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's like a whole different animal.

647
00:45:29,756 --> 00:45:35,780
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they were a little,

648
00:45:37,257 --> 00:45:49,826
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to say sloppy, but the Common Vic licenses weren't monitored as closely for renewal as our licenses, because we do it for the state.

649
00:45:50,106 --> 00:45:51,167
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we have rules.

650
00:45:51,568 --> 00:45:53,309
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not done by November 30th.

651
00:45:53,329 --> 00:45:55,150
[SPEAKER_00]: They got to reapply for a license.

652
00:45:55,771 --> 00:45:57,412
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody makes sure they get it done.

653
00:45:58,367 --> 00:46:21,156
[SPEAKER_00]: When I went to talk to the city clerk last year, she pulled out a stack of, a folder with a stack of applications in there, and it was the middle of the year, and they hadn't been finalized yet, their Common Vic licenses, which kind of threw up a red flag to me, like, okay, are we supposed to be letting them serve alcohol if they haven't gotten a valid Common Vic license?

654
00:46:22,336 --> 00:46:23,657
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, who knows what's going on?

655
00:46:24,957 --> 00:46:40,448
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of a real gray area right now, and I think we ought to establish a citywide, I don't know, format or rule or whatever, just so everybody's on the same page.

656
00:46:41,248 --> 00:46:43,250
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it would be nice if we all work together.

657
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:51,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, I know what health department does, I know what city clerks does.

658
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:57,685
[SPEAKER_05]: building and fire, like building and fire, you know, did a good job this time around.

659
00:46:57,725 --> 00:47:06,535
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, I didn't know who they were issuing the fire inspections to, or people would be like, Oh, well, I need help with this.

660
00:47:06,575 --> 00:47:10,599
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll be like, I don't know, you have to reach out to build, you know, it was much better.

661
00:47:12,594 --> 00:47:19,779
[SPEAKER_05]: 100%, but I feel like it would be nice to know, like, okay, let's send out an internal email for everybody who's involved.

662
00:47:19,899 --> 00:47:20,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, what are you doing?

663
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:21,640
[SPEAKER_05]: What am I doing?

664
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:23,541
[SPEAKER_05]: This is when this is due.

665
00:47:23,641 --> 00:47:24,682
[SPEAKER_05]: This is when this is due.

666
00:47:24,702 --> 00:47:32,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I didn't know, building department asked me for my master list, which is fine, but I didn't know when they were sending out notices about the fire inspections.

667
00:47:33,387 --> 00:47:34,428
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they're doing them together.

668
00:47:35,517 --> 00:47:39,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's the thing, but again, which is good.

669
00:47:40,038 --> 00:47:40,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

670
00:47:40,738 --> 00:47:49,300
[SPEAKER_05]: I, you know, I give them a lot of props and I said, I like the way they did it this year, but I think it's the communication part that's missing where we have to communicate with each other.

671
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:58,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, all right, we're going to start doing inspections because I was more finding out from the owners of the restaurants versus like our internal team.

672
00:47:59,042 --> 00:47:59,502
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

673
00:48:00,342 --> 00:48:12,222
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah so and they could say the same about me and that's fine but i just feel like we need to i always go back to this we'll have to work together to better understand how to tie this together so it's easier for the

674
00:48:13,586 --> 00:48:31,857
[SPEAKER_05]: businesses and people are not saying that they have to jump through the hoops because I felt bad for that turning because she was like This is so complicated, you know, and it's like I know if it's using to me It's confusing to the business owner and to the attorneys too because as they are like if the process is not a hundred percent clear It's difficult.

675
00:48:32,577 --> 00:48:41,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so I get it, you know and I couldn't like I couldn't disagree with her because I I get it because a lot of things we get confused with or we're like Okay, so what are we doing?

676
00:48:42,213 --> 00:48:42,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

677
00:48:42,654 --> 00:48:57,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Just part of the process, you know, and I think we've gotten a lot better and it's moved a long way, but I think we just have to stay on top of it and just kind of like check things off and find out things and just make sure we're clear on what's going on.

678
00:48:57,792 --> 00:48:58,052
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

679
00:48:59,018 --> 00:49:08,084
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's kind of why I want to start a little early this year with the newsletters, just kind of throwing a little blurb out there about this is what we're going to be starting this year.

680
00:49:08,104 --> 00:49:13,207
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to require a copy of a valid Common Vic license.

681
00:49:14,491 --> 00:49:22,753
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it's a 2024, 2025 license, and they're trying to get a 2026 liquor license for renewal, that's fine.

682
00:49:23,053 --> 00:49:27,113
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a valid 2024 Kramovic license.

683
00:49:27,434 --> 00:49:35,035
[SPEAKER_00]: We know it's a valid license, because they don't have to renew until December 31st, which is a month after we have to.

684
00:49:35,315 --> 00:49:39,396
[SPEAKER_00]: So any existing one they have for that year, we're good.

685
00:49:40,296 --> 00:49:45,627
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the same with their fire and building inspection, if it's a valid.

686
00:49:46,688 --> 00:49:47,949
[SPEAKER_00]: inspection certificate.

687
00:49:48,249 --> 00:49:49,350
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all we care about.

688
00:49:50,251 --> 00:49:58,317
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I mean, if it's two years old now, yeah, but if it's supposed to do, it's, it's, it's cool.

689
00:49:58,517 --> 00:50:00,179
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't have a problem with that.

690
00:50:00,919 --> 00:50:11,608
[SPEAKER_00]: And even with Boston, when, you know, my daughter had to renew every year, they'd send a very detailed letter that, um, this is what it's going to cost to renew your common Vic.

691
00:50:11,688 --> 00:50:12,969
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the information we need.

692
00:50:14,182 --> 00:50:22,126
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to need a new certificate of compliance, a certificate of inspection, I think it's called.

693
00:50:22,146 --> 00:50:23,667
[SPEAKER_00]: That was from the building department.

694
00:50:24,168 --> 00:50:30,291
[SPEAKER_00]: And it said in bold letters, you are responsible to have this done before applying for this license.

695
00:50:31,192 --> 00:50:36,555
[SPEAKER_00]: So that tells the person, the business owner, hey, I got to call the building department and get this done.

696
00:50:37,755 --> 00:50:41,818
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, you're also required to have a border health inspection.

697
00:50:42,858 --> 00:50:46,199
[SPEAKER_00]: white paper with big gold seal on it.

698
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:53,863
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the very bottom it says, if you do not have all of these documents, you will not receive your convictual license.

699
00:50:54,763 --> 00:51:00,966
[SPEAKER_00]: So they type it out really clear, and pretty much you go there, you know what you got to do.

700
00:51:01,926 --> 00:51:08,229
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been in line in City Hall waiting, and the girl behind the desks looks at the papers and she goes, no, you don't have this.

701
00:51:08,949 --> 00:51:10,710
[SPEAKER_00]: And she throws it back at him.

702
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:11,530
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get it, come back.

703
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:17,162
[SPEAKER_00]: And people just walk away, and next person in line, yep, they get everything.

704
00:51:17,182 --> 00:51:17,682
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you go.

705
00:51:17,882 --> 00:51:18,302
[SPEAKER_00]: Stamp it.

706
00:51:18,622 --> 00:51:19,202
[SPEAKER_00]: See you later.

707
00:51:19,222 --> 00:51:20,103
[SPEAKER_00]: You're all set.

708
00:51:21,303 --> 00:51:21,823
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know.

709
00:51:21,843 --> 00:51:25,425
[SPEAKER_03]: So what do we do?

710
00:51:25,745 --> 00:51:37,929
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if we can be that efficient, because I don't know what department I used to get that from, whether it was a city clerk, whether it was a licensed department.

711
00:51:38,329 --> 00:51:39,069
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember.

712
00:51:39,089 --> 00:51:39,950
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so long ago.

713
00:51:42,031 --> 00:51:48,354
[SPEAKER_00]: But that one department made sure that you had all of these things together, because she didn't have liquor.

714
00:51:48,394 --> 00:51:54,657
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know it wasn't the liquor license department, but maybe they have a separate licensed department in Boston.

715
00:51:54,997 --> 00:51:55,417
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

716
00:51:55,437 --> 00:51:56,958
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they do.

717
00:51:56,978 --> 00:52:00,260
[SPEAKER_00]: But you make sure you had all your documents before you got your Carmen Vick.

718
00:52:02,075 --> 00:52:02,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that was the thing.

719
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:13,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Attorney Guzman thought that she, when I sent her the licenses, she thought that she was getting the common VIC for me as well.

720
00:52:13,068 --> 00:52:16,152
[SPEAKER_05]: So when she came in, she's like, oh, I didn't see a common VIC.

721
00:52:16,192 --> 00:52:17,414
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, oh, it doesn't come from me.

722
00:52:17,454 --> 00:52:18,515
[SPEAKER_05]: It comes from city clerks.

723
00:52:18,535 --> 00:52:19,596
[SPEAKER_05]: And she's like, oh, my God.

724
00:52:20,217 --> 00:52:40,275
[SPEAKER_05]: i didn't you know like i didn't realize that that's like usually cities do it all together right you look a license together come on vic because again they go hand in hand but yeah it's we're not gonna get to this now we're not gonna get to it i don't even think in a year because i think it's one of those things that

725
00:52:41,521 --> 00:52:44,986
[SPEAKER_05]: it's almost like a new process to adopt, but I think we can get better.

726
00:52:45,006 --> 00:52:51,516
[SPEAKER_05]: I could reach out to Boston too and just see what they do, how they kind of handle it.

727
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:56,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Just again, to make it easier for the

728
00:52:57,529 --> 00:52:59,371
[SPEAKER_05]: people more so for the businesses.

729
00:52:59,391 --> 00:53:02,553
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but I don't think you can.

730
00:53:05,115 --> 00:53:09,098
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you imagine the workload that's going to be on you if you got to do work?

731
00:53:09,159 --> 00:53:13,462
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, I think we just have to streamline it better.

732
00:53:13,502 --> 00:53:17,385
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's doable if we have all the departments involved.

733
00:53:17,505 --> 00:53:19,487
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just how do we bring everybody together?

734
00:53:20,088 --> 00:53:20,768
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.

735
00:53:21,629 --> 00:53:22,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

736
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:25,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Because obviously we don't have that kind of

737
00:53:27,023 --> 00:53:35,169
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what will have to happen is each department will have to send out a newsletter or a notice like we're doing.

738
00:53:35,429 --> 00:53:39,292
[SPEAKER_00]: And they got to send it out and say, OK, this is what's going to happen this year.

739
00:53:40,113 --> 00:53:53,703
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Bill, the clerk's department, OK, on your common vigilance license, if these hours are not what you require, please contact the clerk's department immediately, and we'll change it.

740
00:53:54,103 --> 00:53:54,304
[SPEAKER_00]: Fine.

741
00:53:54,444 --> 00:53:55,064
[SPEAKER_00]: They change it.

742
00:53:55,104 --> 00:53:56,105
[SPEAKER_00]: They send them a new common vic.

743
00:53:57,053 --> 00:53:58,160
[SPEAKER_00]: So now by the end of the.

744
00:53:59,352 --> 00:54:07,074
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, come November, they'll have a Common Vic with their proper ID, proper powers that they can submit to us.

745
00:54:07,974 --> 00:54:12,416
[SPEAKER_00]: And whatever's on that Common Vic is what we'll put on their liquor license.

746
00:54:13,096 --> 00:54:18,497
[SPEAKER_00]: And once it's in there and you renew, I'm sure that data just all renews, correct?

747
00:54:18,858 --> 00:54:22,239
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for what the previous years was, pretty much.

748
00:54:23,099 --> 00:54:26,760
[SPEAKER_00]: So that'll kind of streamline us a little, but

749
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:30,823
[SPEAKER_00]: The clerk's office has got to do the work before us, you know what I mean?

750
00:54:31,984 --> 00:54:38,329
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the licensee has got to go to the clerk's office and say, hey, I want to stay open these hours.

751
00:54:38,369 --> 00:54:39,130
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I do it?

752
00:54:39,470 --> 00:54:42,233
[SPEAKER_00]: And they tell them, you know, fill out the paperwork.

753
00:54:42,293 --> 00:54:44,875
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to go before the council, which is the way it is now.

754
00:54:46,737 --> 00:54:53,042
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they'll give them the new common victim and they submit it to us during renewal.

755
00:54:53,162 --> 00:54:54,023
[SPEAKER_00]: We can only put

756
00:54:55,237 --> 00:54:58,778
[SPEAKER_00]: on the liquor license what the hours are on the common vac.

757
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:03,400
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, it's up to the licensee to do the rest.

758
00:55:05,861 --> 00:55:10,003
[SPEAKER_00]: But, I don't know, unless they want to change the rules in the city.

759
00:55:11,464 --> 00:55:14,765
[SPEAKER_00]: Which, I don't know.

760
00:55:14,825 --> 00:55:15,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

761
00:55:16,446 --> 00:55:18,206
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is kind of strange.

762
00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:27,091
[SPEAKER_00]: But, hey, we're taking baby steps and you can't move the whole mountain at once.

763
00:55:27,391 --> 00:55:31,372
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to take a little chunk at a time, you know.

764
00:55:32,813 --> 00:55:33,913
[SPEAKER_00]: So, let's see what happens.

765
00:55:37,474 --> 00:55:38,314
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody good?

766
00:55:38,734 --> 00:55:39,174
[SPEAKER_05]: That was it.

767
00:55:40,094 --> 00:55:40,294
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.

768
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:41,915
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.

769
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:42,655
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

770
00:55:43,235 --> 00:55:46,316
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see you next month and go from there.

771
00:55:47,016 --> 00:55:48,296
[SPEAKER_00]: Motion to adjourn the meeting.

772
00:55:50,254 --> 00:55:50,817
[SPEAKER_00]: I second it.

773
00:55:51,158 --> 00:55:51,841
[SPEAKER_00]: All those in favor?

774
00:55:51,942 --> 00:55:52,183
[SPEAKER_00]: Aye.

775
00:55:54,533 --> 00:55:55,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thanks, guys.

776
00:55:55,597 --> 00:55:56,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Dario and Bobby.

777
00:55:56,401 --> 00:55:56,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

778
00:55:57,043 --> 00:55:57,626
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye, guys.

779
00:55:57,726 --> 00:55:58,550
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, take care.
