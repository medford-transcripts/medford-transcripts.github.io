1
00:10:59,297 --> 00:10:59,808
[SPEAKER_10]: Test one, two.

2

5
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:43,682
[SPEAKER_05]: There'll be a meeting in the Medford city council committee of the whole at 6pm and the city council chamber second floor Medford city hall.

6
00:20:44,462 --> 00:20:48,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, turn this down a little bit.

7
00:20:48,965 --> 00:20:59,272
[SPEAKER_05]: 85 George B has to drive Medford Massachusetts and via zoom action discussion items 25039 annual budget process for fiscal year 2026 preliminary budget meeting number three.

8
00:21:00,132 --> 00:21:07,057
[SPEAKER_05]: This will be the third preliminary budget meeting of the fiscal 26 budget process the mayor has communicated that the following departments we present Board of Health.

9
00:21:07,828 --> 00:21:13,353
[SPEAKER_05]: facilities, IT, elections, executive and law, and we'll take it in that order.

10
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:21,339
[SPEAKER_05]: And just a reminder that we have also two budget meetings ahead of us on May 20th and May 21st.

11
00:21:21,379 --> 00:21:27,644
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we also have already had two budget meetings on April 29th and April 30th.

12
00:21:29,766 --> 00:21:33,069
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that, we will start with the Board of Health and Civil Defense.

13
00:21:41,305 --> 00:21:41,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome.

14
00:21:41,665 --> 00:21:44,027
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to turn this on.

15
00:21:44,407 --> 00:21:44,767
[SPEAKER_05]: It's on.

16
00:21:44,847 --> 00:21:45,187
[SPEAKER_01]: You're good.

17
00:21:45,247 --> 00:21:47,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, good.

18
00:21:47,548 --> 00:21:57,074
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm happy to just read it out really quickly and then you can add all the lovely details and I'll give you a little prompt when I'm done and then we can go to questions from members of the council.

19
00:21:58,515 --> 00:22:01,836
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have the Board of Health and Animal Control.

20
00:22:02,637 --> 00:22:04,198
[SPEAKER_05]: We had the fiscal 25 budget at 810,978.

21
00:22:09,138 --> 00:22:14,140
[SPEAKER_05]: fiscal 26 proposed $955,579 for an increase of $144,601.

22
00:22:15,421 --> 00:22:21,043
[SPEAKER_05]: And these are fixed costs.

23
00:22:21,543 --> 00:22:30,187
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a significant increase in the employees, and that is because two positions that were 50% ARPA are being added to the general fund.

24
00:22:30,947 --> 00:22:36,150
[SPEAKER_05]: And we also had COLA increases and step increases for our non-union and union employees.

25
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:41,503
[SPEAKER_05]: The mosquito control and kennel services are up 16,000.

26
00:22:41,663 --> 00:22:49,165
[SPEAKER_05]: That's an increase by 4% for the mosquito control and kennel services have increased with more dogs being held each year.

27
00:22:51,245 --> 00:23:03,088
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically just the three questions are if you wanna explain more about the change in the budget and talk more about what I just kind of did a quick overview of.

28
00:23:03,892 --> 00:23:07,654
[SPEAKER_05]: We'd love to hear your highlights of the past year any plans for the upcoming year.

29
00:23:08,934 --> 00:23:16,037
[SPEAKER_05]: And then finally, you know, what is a priority or a project that isn't funded this year that you'd like to see funded in the future.

30
00:23:17,177 --> 00:23:18,718
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I'll turn it over to you.

31
00:23:19,939 --> 00:23:27,902
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess the biggest changes in the budget like you mentioned, typically mosquito control and canine expenses were combined into one line item.

32
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,322
[SPEAKER_01]: We've separated them out this year to make it a little cleaner.

33
00:23:32,303 --> 00:23:41,211
[SPEAKER_01]: So our mosquito control services did increase by 4% so that's the 27 six that we've already received the invoice for for the upcoming year.

34
00:23:41,771 --> 00:23:46,275
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we split out canine expenses and added additional funding.

35
00:23:46,755 --> 00:23:54,077
[SPEAKER_01]: to that line item because we are already over budget this year with the number of dogs we've had to deal with and the services we've had to provide.

36
00:23:55,037 --> 00:23:56,478
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's for that increase.

37
00:23:57,218 --> 00:24:07,621
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like you said, the employees, it's just mostly stepping Kohler, and the removal of two positions off of opera.

38
00:24:08,661 --> 00:24:10,082
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you see the.

39
00:24:11,702 --> 00:24:13,603
[SPEAKER_01]: health equity coordinator position there.

40
00:24:13,623 --> 00:24:20,825
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that looks small, but that's actually just a match for the Barr Foundation funding that we have.

41
00:24:21,266 --> 00:24:23,606
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the city's match for the salary.

42
00:24:24,287 --> 00:24:26,728
[SPEAKER_01]: The rest of the salary comes from the Barr Foundation.

43
00:24:30,809 --> 00:24:31,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

44
00:24:31,249 --> 00:24:34,310
[SPEAKER_05]: What were the two positions that came onto the general fund from ARPA?

45
00:24:35,351 --> 00:24:38,012
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was the administrative support

46
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:40,840
[SPEAKER_01]: and the community social worker.

47
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:41,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, thank you.

48
00:24:44,322 --> 00:24:45,963
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just, I guess, a couple of highlights.

49
00:24:46,003 --> 00:24:50,706
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are participating in what's called the Public Health Excellence Grant.

50
00:24:50,766 --> 00:24:58,290
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a regional grant with five other communities that does give us access to additional personnel and services.

51
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:06,615
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that funding, we've been able to supplement some of our food inspection work with a consultant paid to the PHE grant.

52
00:25:07,773 --> 00:25:17,572
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's helped us accomplish over 551 restaurants inspections this year, which is a lot better than we've done in previous years and hopefully that'll continue.

53
00:25:19,657 --> 00:25:32,664
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the highlight with our environmental services is because of our participation in this public health excellence grant, there's a lot more training required of our inspectional services piece and our inspector employees.

54
00:25:33,884 --> 00:25:39,767
[SPEAKER_01]: All three of our inspectors have completed what's called tier two food safety inspection training.

55
00:25:40,368 --> 00:25:45,250
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm told that that's where the first health department in the Northeast region to have that accomplishment.

56
00:25:45,904 --> 00:25:48,725
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of our inspectors Z is actually tier three trained.

57
00:25:49,165 --> 00:25:51,966
[SPEAKER_01]: So the other two will be moving forward with that as well.

58
00:25:53,547 --> 00:25:56,208
[SPEAKER_01]: Our public health nursing has been hot at work this year.

59
00:25:56,948 --> 00:26:01,009
[SPEAKER_01]: She is actually out on maternity leave right now, which is another highlight of the year.

60
00:26:01,049 --> 00:26:02,430
[SPEAKER_01]: She had twins, so that's nice.

61
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:08,432
[SPEAKER_01]: But she conducted over 800 shots or flu and COVID shots at clinics.

62
00:26:09,092 --> 00:26:10,152
[SPEAKER_01]: She provided 149 homebound shots.

63
00:26:12,849 --> 00:26:25,920
[SPEAKER_01]: and she's been working with the schools to help administer vaccines and TB tests to students needing them to enter Medford Public Schools that are holding 302 vaccines and 86 TB tests.

64
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:34,787
[SPEAKER_01]: We're helping that program, it's called the Vaccine for Children Program, and it's free vaccines from the state that we received, which they received through the CDC.

65
00:26:36,043 --> 00:26:43,446
[SPEAKER_01]: We're hoping that program continues, but we're not sure with the federal funding on the line, if we'll be able to continue that, which would be a shame.

66
00:26:45,126 --> 00:26:51,889
[SPEAKER_01]: Our Office of Prevention and Outreach has been doing amazing work through a municipal vulnerable preparedness grant.

67
00:26:52,369 --> 00:26:54,389
[SPEAKER_01]: We've expanded our outreach and events.

68
00:26:55,290 --> 00:27:04,613
[SPEAKER_01]: Our community connectors team has organized over a dozen citywide events, the winter preparedness, the Hispanic and Brazilian heritage celebrations,

69
00:27:05,213 --> 00:27:08,996
[SPEAKER_01]: engaging more than 500 residents and families and sharing resources.

70
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:11,918
[SPEAKER_01]: We've enhanced our language and access support.

71
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:14,420
[SPEAKER_01]: We still have our multilingual access line.

72
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,963
[SPEAKER_01]: We've received about 150 calls this year to that line.

73
00:27:18,863 --> 00:27:24,447
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, navigating services for folks in Spanish, Haitian, Creole, Portuguese, and Arabic.

74
00:27:25,688 --> 00:27:26,409
[SPEAKER_01]: We've completed

75
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:45,524
[SPEAKER_01]: 540 community liaisons and 121 social service navigation cases across those five languages as well, but assisting folks with mass health insurance, getting them on SNAP benefits, assisting them with housing, legal work, job readiness workshops.

76
00:27:46,745 --> 00:27:49,747
[SPEAKER_01]: ESOL classes has been huge and we're really working.

77
00:27:50,368 --> 00:27:57,214
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things we're excited about hopefully going forward into next year is a expanded relationship with Bunker Hill University.

78
00:27:58,455 --> 00:28:06,741
[SPEAKER_01]: and having ESOL classes enhanced through Bunker Hill's assistance and other work readiness programming as well through Bunker Hill.

79
00:28:07,242 --> 00:28:08,062
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's exciting.

80
00:28:09,543 --> 00:28:13,427
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a new social service coordinator, came on last November.

81
00:28:14,347 --> 00:28:15,568
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been doing great work.

82
00:28:15,708 --> 00:28:23,915
[SPEAKER_01]: He's really has robust interagency collaboration with Elliott, ABCD and Housing Families, Medford Housing Authority.

83
00:28:24,964 --> 00:28:31,851
[SPEAKER_01]: He's helping with the hub, the Medford Baldwin Hub and the Housing Task Force meetings, really facilitating coordinated care.

84
00:28:32,191 --> 00:28:42,942
[SPEAKER_01]: He's also been doing a lot of work with DCR and reaching out to some of our unhoused individuals throughout Medford and trying to assist with services.

85
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:53,153
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a wonderful Community Connections to Care Symposium, which came out of funding we received from Mellwack Tufts Healthcare.

86
00:28:54,093 --> 00:29:04,136
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a program designed to look at and evaluate the behavioral health needs of diverse communities and how we could do outreach.

87
00:29:04,516 --> 00:29:11,218
[SPEAKER_01]: And that campaign that we created reached over 12,000 residents through targeted digital outreach and billboards.

88
00:29:12,278 --> 00:29:20,280
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have a relationship now with North Suffolk for our recovery coach services we've contracted with North Suffolk, we have Chris was wonderful.

89
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,120
[SPEAKER_01]: He's with us working.

90
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:25,261
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of that is funded through our opioid settlement money.

91
00:29:25,281 --> 00:29:30,262
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also have to rise foundation grants that helps fund that work.

92
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:36,363
[SPEAKER_01]: So we not only do sober home scholarships will assist with transportation will.

93
00:29:37,284 --> 00:29:43,270
[SPEAKER_01]: They give them gym memberships which allows them to not only be healthy but also hygienic.

94
00:29:43,971 --> 00:29:50,998
[SPEAKER_01]: And we mark National Overdose Awareness Day with our community to display to raise awareness and none of those lives last overdoses.

95
00:29:51,879 --> 00:29:53,101
[SPEAKER_01]: So Chris is doing great work.

96
00:29:54,442 --> 00:30:13,289
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're actually going to be holding a program here tomorrow for employees, both Chris and Jason, our community social worker, helping them to assist and de-escalate situations and let our employees know how to deal with customers who may have issues that need to be de-escalated and saved.

97
00:30:16,057 --> 00:30:29,227
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, and going forward, our plans for this year that we're looking forward to accomplishing is trying to streamline our permitting system, working with CitizenServe to go online and make it easier for folks to get their permits.

98
00:30:29,728 --> 00:30:40,116
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're gonna start with simpler, like dumpster and hauler permits, and then hopefully by the end of next fiscal year, we'll actually have our food permitting process online, which would be really great.

99
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:44,660
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's, I think that's everything.

100
00:30:46,047 --> 00:30:51,508
[SPEAKER_05]: My only other question was, is there anything that you'd like to do that wasn't able to be funded this year?

101
00:30:52,869 --> 00:30:58,650
[SPEAKER_01]: We've just been lucky to all of the grants and the PHE grant is really huge.

102
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:04,771
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that grant, again, is allowed to continue, that's over $500,000 for us in the region.

103
00:31:05,811 --> 00:31:10,652
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, what's concerning is where public health funding may be going in the future.

104
00:31:10,872 --> 00:31:12,913
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be a problem.

105
00:31:14,827 --> 00:31:15,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, well, thank you.

106
00:31:15,609 --> 00:31:19,036
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna go to Councilor Lazzaro, then Councilor Leming, then Councilor Tseng.

107
00:31:19,156 --> 00:31:19,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lazzaro.

108
00:31:21,083 --> 00:31:22,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much for being here.

109
00:31:22,825 --> 00:31:34,714
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to highlight the fact that your department is, I mean, nominally the health department, but it encompasses so many different areas of the city.

110
00:31:34,734 --> 00:31:41,659
[SPEAKER_03]: You cover permitting for restaurants, things like dumpsters.

111
00:31:41,719 --> 00:31:46,003
[SPEAKER_03]: We've worked with you on rodents, overgrowth ordinances.

112
00:31:47,764 --> 00:31:59,934
[SPEAKER_03]: gender affirming care and reproductive health care, things like food insecurity, things like services for people who are unhoused or

113
00:32:02,523 --> 00:32:10,270
[SPEAKER_03]: have substance use disorder, there are so many things that your department does that I think it could be like four or five departments.

114
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:15,134
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just really appreciate all of the work that your department does.

115
00:32:15,534 --> 00:32:22,760
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was I was wondering if you could tell us how many employees, how many full time and how many part time employees you have?

116
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,541
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm hmm.

117
00:32:24,861 --> 00:32:32,387
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have three full time inspectors, we have an administrative clerk and a head clerk in the environmental side of life.

118
00:32:33,067 --> 00:32:44,035
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on the Office of Prevention and Outreach, we city funded is our Office of Prevention Outreach manager, as well as a social worker.

119
00:32:45,856 --> 00:32:47,758
[SPEAKER_01]: And then our health equity coordinator is

120
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:53,784
[SPEAKER_01]: 80% bar funded, and the recovery coach is funded through the opioid foundation.

121
00:32:53,844 --> 00:33:01,889
[SPEAKER_01]: He's part-time, he's 18 hours a week, but then the liaisons and the connectors is five of each.

122
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:07,153
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all grant funded, partially through bar and partly through the MVP grant.

123
00:33:07,713 --> 00:33:08,434
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're part-time.

124
00:33:08,474 --> 00:33:09,254
[SPEAKER_01]: They're up to 15 hours a week.

125
00:33:11,202 --> 00:33:29,924
[SPEAKER_03]: It really often, I mean, the impression I get is that it's pulled together from a lot of different sources and that in other cities of similar size, it will often, I feel like I've worked in other cities where, or I've interacted with other cities where

126
00:33:31,846 --> 00:33:41,869
[SPEAKER_03]: their issues are similar to ours, but they have departments that are many times larger, many more opportunities for people to access things like maybe an office of housing security.

127
00:33:41,949 --> 00:33:57,633
[SPEAKER_03]: So if somebody is going through a struggle to stay in their housing, they would have access to somebody who would be able to, you know, like maybe seven or eight people who would be able to help with like the intricacies of that.

128
00:33:57,813 --> 00:33:57,933
[SPEAKER_03]: And

129
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:03,536
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like a lot to put on the back of somebody in one health department.

130
00:34:04,477 --> 00:34:18,390
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just really appreciate all you and your department do and how much work it must be to manage all of this and really appreciate your presentation and it's a difficult time, generally, so

131
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:30,936
[SPEAKER_03]: I just appreciate you laying it all out for us and all the work you've been doing and growing the community liaison program as well, which is very exciting.

132
00:34:31,696 --> 00:34:32,597
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you very much.

133
00:34:32,617 --> 00:34:33,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

134
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:35,218
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

135
00:34:35,238 --> 00:34:35,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Leming.

136
00:34:38,112 --> 00:34:44,676
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I would also like to echo all the praise that my colleague just gave.

137
00:34:44,696 --> 00:34:57,845
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a department that has far too many tasks and demand, and I feel like it just doesn't have the

138
00:34:59,047 --> 00:35:05,452
[SPEAKER_09]: capacity to fulfill to fulfill all of that, which is which relates to my question.

139
00:35:05,492 --> 00:35:19,702
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, as a city councilors, we often get concerns about things like rats in the city, which is not uncommon with municipalities in greater Boston.

140
00:35:20,503 --> 00:35:27,388
[SPEAKER_09]: We get concerns about like there's one resident who is messaging me about

141
00:35:28,227 --> 00:35:33,313
[SPEAKER_09]: raccoons that are in a neighboring house that she can't seem to do anything about.

142
00:35:33,413 --> 00:35:37,258
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure that you're aware of the case that I'm talking about.

143
00:35:38,359 --> 00:35:45,828
[SPEAKER_09]: And, of course, we also hear a number of concerns about dog poop not being picked up, things like that.

144
00:35:45,848 --> 00:35:47,210
[SPEAKER_09]: And I see

145
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:55,912
[SPEAKER_09]: that there is one animal control officer who I've heard is a one man department and himself so very much appreciated.

146
00:35:55,932 --> 00:36:09,596
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, my question first is how, given all of the, uh, given all the need around the city for the services that are offered by the department by the by the Board of Health.

147
00:36:10,336 --> 00:36:15,717
[SPEAKER_09]: How many employees do you think you would need in a perfect world to fulfill all of that?

148
00:36:16,118 --> 00:36:17,158
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't think that the

149
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:20,852
[SPEAKER_09]: 11 personnel that we're seeing is necessarily enough.

150
00:36:20,972 --> 00:36:27,055
[SPEAKER_09]: But just hypothetically, if the city did have more resources to handle, what would what would be your need?

151
00:36:27,075 --> 00:36:35,680
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, certainly at least at least one more inspector, if not one and a half to help keep up with the requirements.

152
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,722
[SPEAKER_01]: Animal control is tough because he's

153
00:36:40,235 --> 00:37:00,542
[SPEAKER_01]: nine to five during the day, you know, a third of what they the best of us so off hours and weekends, you know there's often situations that sometimes the police have to respond to or others and then people get upset that their needs are getting met so you know, another animal control officer to help with those off hours on call something of that nature.

154
00:37:02,305 --> 00:37:10,208
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously, yeah, I mean, we could do more if we had another social service person and another recovery person.

155
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:12,369
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we could definitely do more outreach.

156
00:37:12,429 --> 00:37:18,071
[SPEAKER_01]: But with that, you need to have the support and revenue and the programming to also offer stuff.

157
00:37:18,311 --> 00:37:24,814
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need also additional funding for, you know, to do actually to do the work, not just the bodies.

158
00:37:25,194 --> 00:37:26,495
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.

159
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:27,095
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

160
00:37:28,289 --> 00:37:40,113
[SPEAKER_09]: So I was hearing about five different you probably need about five more people to plus additional funding for the programming in order to meet at least some of that need was was what I was.

161
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:46,704
[SPEAKER_01]: We're actually hoping to bring on a because we've been doing a lot of work which is great really exciting work with the schools.

162
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:49,286
[SPEAKER_01]: So again through grant funding.

163
00:37:50,006 --> 00:38:03,334
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be bringing on a part time prevention coordinator as well to work more closely with the school so like again, a lot of what we do is grant funded we rely heavily on grants, the grants go away, we're in trouble.

164
00:38:04,698 --> 00:38:10,602
[SPEAKER_09]: And for for all of the positions that that I'm seeing here.

165
00:38:11,402 --> 00:38:23,110
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you say that the amount of the salaries listed is commensurate with what we see in other municipalities is a little bit more, a little bit less, what would, how would you put that?

166
00:38:25,296 --> 00:38:31,720
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in the ballpark with most, as far as our inspectors and our public health nursing.

167
00:38:33,301 --> 00:38:45,408
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, our outreach manager, prevention outreach manager is probably, I would say, for her caliber, a little underpaid for the work that she does.

168
00:38:46,869 --> 00:38:50,131
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part, we're pretty in line with most communities.

169
00:38:52,316 --> 00:38:58,748
[SPEAKER_09]: And a very specific question this just relates to a little bit of research I was doing in response to what one constituent was asking.

170
00:39:00,511 --> 00:39:02,553
[SPEAKER_09]: The sanitarians.

171
00:39:03,594 --> 00:39:15,983
[SPEAKER_09]: So I had a constituent who was saying that the sanitarians in Medford didn't have a state license, which I looked up sanitarians in other municipalities, and I found out that that was pretty common.

172
00:39:16,023 --> 00:39:24,689
[SPEAKER_09]: So most of them didn't have a license under the state for the, I think it was like the Board of Health Sanitarian License.

173
00:39:24,709 --> 00:39:28,132
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you just for my own benefit tell me about what

174
00:39:28,832 --> 00:39:31,513
[SPEAKER_09]: that processes or what the benefit of that of having that is.

175
00:39:32,033 --> 00:39:53,797
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're actually all in the process of going through to become registered sanitarians, but there are requirements like you actually have to be on the job for a year or two and then some of them are brand new for us so they can't even apply yet, but see is he's he's in the process of becoming a registered sanitarian, but again, the state is really looking to

176
00:39:54,798 --> 00:40:07,590
[SPEAKER_01]: coordinate regionalized services so that if you're getting a food inspection in Malden you're getting the same food inspection in Medford right so they want all the instructors to be trained at the same level, which is like that tier two that I was talking about they will be going through tier three.

177
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:13,776
[SPEAKER_01]: They want consistency throughout the state and that's why they're providing all this funding to our public health excellence grant.

178
00:40:14,396 --> 00:40:31,517
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're all going through immense trainings but you know in order to do pool inspections they all have to be have their CPO in order to the food inspections they all have to have the surf safe and again this this additional training with the tears program housing the same thing there's a tear program for housing that they're all going through.

179
00:40:31,937 --> 00:40:34,078
[SPEAKER_01]: So the inspections, again, will be consistent.

180
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:37,801
[SPEAKER_01]: But to be an RRS, that's a lot of studying.

181
00:40:38,101 --> 00:40:39,121
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a hard exam.

182
00:40:39,702 --> 00:40:42,543
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to meet certain requirements before you can even apply.

183
00:40:42,583 --> 00:40:46,946
[SPEAKER_01]: But honestly, I believe Z is taking his within the next month or two.

184
00:40:47,026 --> 00:40:49,047
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of exciting.

185
00:40:49,167 --> 00:40:51,088
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's like a national accreditation.

186
00:40:51,188 --> 00:40:51,669
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.

187
00:40:51,829 --> 00:40:54,430
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I was just curious about that for my own knowledge.

188
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:54,951
[SPEAKER_09]: And finally,

189
00:40:56,692 --> 00:41:03,377
[SPEAKER_09]: So we've been receiving some demand from constituents who really want backyard chickens.

190
00:41:04,698 --> 00:41:07,160
[SPEAKER_09]: They want to have chickens in their backyard.

191
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:12,784
[SPEAKER_09]: It is something that I have been hearing from niche groups for a little bit now.

192
00:41:13,985 --> 00:41:17,868
[SPEAKER_09]: But the Board of Health does not want to deal with backyard chickens.

193
00:41:17,908 --> 00:41:21,570
[SPEAKER_09]: And I understand that there are good reasons for not wanting to deal with that.

194
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:22,871
[SPEAKER_09]: So could you just

195
00:41:24,125 --> 00:41:34,147
[SPEAKER_09]: While I'm asking you questions, could you just talk a little bit about why, like what extra staffing hypothetically would be needed to deal with that in the future?

196
00:41:34,707 --> 00:41:36,007
[SPEAKER_09]: Should we move in that direction?

197
00:41:36,027 --> 00:41:37,508
[SPEAKER_09]: Just some of your concerns.

198
00:41:37,808 --> 00:41:38,068
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

199
00:41:39,268 --> 00:41:43,269
[SPEAKER_01]: I know people, especially with the price of eggs these days.

200
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:48,510
[SPEAKER_01]: Chickens are really, we have rodents.

201
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:52,651
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a real rodent problem and chickens would,

202
00:41:53,515 --> 00:42:03,866
[SPEAKER_01]: severely contribute to that rodent problem, not only with their feed, but also with their, you know, their feces, and they actually do carry, their feces does carry disease.

203
00:42:04,026 --> 00:42:11,814
[SPEAKER_01]: So, unless they really are taken care of well, and that's the thing, people want them and then do they really know how to take care of them and do it the right way.

204
00:42:12,555 --> 00:42:21,966
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, there's a noise factor people complain about the noise if their neighbors so there's certain like you know they if they have the space, we would actually have to look at you know how much space.

205
00:42:22,988 --> 00:42:26,652
[SPEAKER_01]: How close are they to their neighbors how close will the chicken could be to their neighbors yet.

206
00:42:27,633 --> 00:42:31,478
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of considerations, but right now with our rodent problem.

207
00:42:33,203 --> 00:42:39,165
[SPEAKER_01]: I would not want to contribute to that even more at this point because we're really trying to get that under control first.

208
00:42:39,826 --> 00:42:47,990
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, well, I used to own chickens well my mom did so I'm a little bit biased in that direction but this is a conversation for another day.

209
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:48,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

210
00:43:01,355 --> 00:43:02,757
[SPEAKER_05]: thing is chicken neutral.

211
00:43:10,347 --> 00:43:12,811
[SPEAKER_07]: For people who missed my comment, I said I do like to eat chicken.

212
00:43:19,443 --> 00:43:30,965
[SPEAKER_07]: I do wanna echo the sentiments of Councilor Lazzaro and Councilor Leming in thanking you for all the work that you've done with the City Council this year, this past year.

213
00:43:32,165 --> 00:43:37,066
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Lazzaro really rattled off a long list and that's testament to our cooperation.

214
00:43:38,847 --> 00:43:41,447
[SPEAKER_07]: I just had a few kind of shorter questions.

215
00:43:42,107 --> 00:43:45,468
[SPEAKER_07]: I think a lot of similar questions have been asked.

216
00:43:47,639 --> 00:43:50,720
[SPEAKER_07]: When we talk about, you know, worries that grant money might disappear.

217
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:59,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there any positions you have in mind that, you know, might be at risk in the next budget year.

218
00:43:59,723 --> 00:44:01,784
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, actually I forgot to mention, shame on me.

219
00:44:03,624 --> 00:44:08,748
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have what's called the BCS Bureau of Substance Abuse Services through DPH.

220
00:44:09,808 --> 00:44:18,714
[SPEAKER_01]: We are the fiscal agent for a regional grant and it really does provide a lot of support for all of our prevention work with the schools and others.

221
00:44:19,014 --> 00:44:24,678
[SPEAKER_01]: And Sophie is our full-time coordinator of that grant.

222
00:44:25,939 --> 00:44:27,240
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is a...

223
00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:32,313
[SPEAKER_01]: a grant that's funded through comes through the feds on down.

224
00:44:32,393 --> 00:44:33,374
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's concerning.

225
00:44:34,015 --> 00:44:36,637
[SPEAKER_01]: And we already know it was a $250,000 grant.

226
00:44:36,877 --> 00:44:41,320
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, it's a regional grant that covers four or five communities probably five.

227
00:44:43,362 --> 00:44:48,446
[SPEAKER_01]: We already know it's going to be cut to 150 at max, it could be 125 we're not sure yet.

228
00:44:48,907 --> 00:44:50,508
[SPEAKER_01]: So the money's already being

229
00:44:51,299 --> 00:44:51,819
[SPEAKER_01]: cut in half.

230
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:57,001
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's going to cut into the work we can do prevention wise.

231
00:44:57,041 --> 00:45:00,662
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now, like that grant is funding our Youth Action Council at the high school.

232
00:45:00,782 --> 00:45:06,043
[SPEAKER_01]: It's helping with our I Decide and a few other programs that we have at the high school.

233
00:45:06,083 --> 00:45:08,044
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah.

234
00:45:08,904 --> 00:45:10,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that funding her position as well?

235
00:45:11,225 --> 00:45:11,425
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

236
00:45:12,465 --> 00:45:13,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

237
00:45:13,825 --> 00:45:20,107
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you aware of any plans to, you know, in case that funding disappears, what we're going to do next as a city?

238
00:45:21,755 --> 00:45:24,297
[SPEAKER_01]: would have to just chase additional grants at this point.

239
00:45:26,438 --> 00:45:32,321
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, we're lucky we do have the opioid settlement money, but there are real restrictions on what that can be spent on.

240
00:45:32,461 --> 00:45:45,508
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I mean, I think it's just it's awful what's happening from, you know, from at that level, and especially in terms of what it means for our resources as a city.

241
00:45:45,568 --> 00:45:48,410
[SPEAKER_07]: So anything that we can do to kind of plan ahead,

242
00:45:49,427 --> 00:45:52,369
[SPEAKER_07]: plan for the worst, I think, would be a good idea.

243
00:45:52,389 --> 00:46:00,235
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess something just for all of us to keep in the back of our heads, especially for Councilors and administration.

244
00:46:01,116 --> 00:46:08,942
[SPEAKER_07]: My final question, I know we've talked a lot about this, and I expect this is just me rehashing what we talked about.

245
00:46:09,575 --> 00:46:14,839
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of residents recently have reached out to us about rats, about rodents.

246
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:16,861
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know it's top of mind for you.

247
00:46:17,201 --> 00:46:27,109
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was wondering if you wanted to take this opportunity to quickly summarize again what we're doing as a city on rodents, and maybe what we can do going forward.

248
00:46:28,266 --> 00:46:32,908
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do respond to every complaint that we get as timely as we can.

249
00:46:34,149 --> 00:46:39,712
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do still contract with Yankee Pest Control through APA funding.

250
00:46:39,732 --> 00:46:43,854
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are able to go to residents and treat burrows.

251
00:46:44,034 --> 00:46:47,996
[SPEAKER_01]: If there are burrows on their properties, we're not using rodenticide.

252
00:46:48,476 --> 00:46:50,437
[SPEAKER_01]: They're using the carbon monoxide treatment.

253
00:46:51,357 --> 00:46:54,779
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not doing rodenticide with our city program at all.

254
00:46:56,178 --> 00:47:07,121
[SPEAKER_01]: But we are looking into other options, and the road and control ordinance that you all passed does have those fees attached to it, and also fines.

255
00:47:07,701 --> 00:47:13,143
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now we are getting the fees collected and that's going into a restricted account.

256
00:47:15,024 --> 00:47:19,749
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not quite there getting the fines yet, the ordinance would have to be revised a little bit.

257
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:33,724
[SPEAKER_01]: But we are getting pretty good fees from construction, dumpsters, all kinds of places where we're mandating that they provide what's called an integrated pest management plan, it's an IPM.

258
00:47:34,764 --> 00:47:40,946
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have to contract with a licensed pest control agency, have to provide us with the plan, what they're going to do, how often they're going to do it.

259
00:47:42,086 --> 00:47:44,226
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're monitoring all of that all the time.

260
00:47:45,627 --> 00:47:46,447
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.

261
00:47:46,927 --> 00:47:47,467
[SPEAKER_07]: That's helpful.

262
00:47:47,687 --> 00:47:52,728
[SPEAKER_07]: I think for residents to hear, to be reassured that, you know, we are paying attention to this issue.

263
00:47:53,529 --> 00:47:58,490
[SPEAKER_07]: You mentioned, if we want to collect fines, we need to adjust the ordinance a little bit.

264
00:47:58,790 --> 00:48:01,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you aware of Councilors who are already working on that?

265
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:03,931
[SPEAKER_07]: Or is that something that we should take on?

266
00:48:05,142 --> 00:48:06,003
[SPEAKER_05]: can send us the language.

267
00:48:06,323 --> 00:48:07,204
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think anyone's working.

268
00:48:07,444 --> 00:48:09,986
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not aware of anyone working on it yet.

269
00:48:10,026 --> 00:48:12,408
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've had a little bit of a discussion earlier.

270
00:48:12,428 --> 00:48:15,270
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now, like I said, the fines are going into revolving accounts.

271
00:48:15,290 --> 00:48:23,257
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's great, because that hopefully will once the app only runs out, that'll help fund continue to fund our program with borrowers.

272
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:29,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and I know that there's problem properties that really, you know, need to be

273
00:48:30,262 --> 00:48:36,226
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and it's sometimes it's more difficult to get folks to, to do what needs to be done to comply.

274
00:48:36,286 --> 00:48:47,974
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's just too expensive for them, you know, sometimes it's just too much work because they're alone and their elders and so yeah, coming up with additional assistance would be great.

275
00:48:48,274 --> 00:48:52,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and I know you'll be judicious and I know that the fine is certainly the last resort.

276
00:48:53,838 --> 00:48:55,479
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know, if there's someone who

277
00:48:56,918 --> 00:49:01,801
[SPEAKER_05]: can fix it and just chooses not to, that's not being a good neighbor.

278
00:49:02,001 --> 00:49:02,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

279
00:49:03,082 --> 00:49:04,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else, Councilor Osanic?

280
00:49:04,123 --> 00:49:04,843
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm good, thanks.

281
00:49:05,523 --> 00:49:05,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

282
00:49:06,044 --> 00:49:06,984
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

283
00:49:07,044 --> 00:49:16,490
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so feel free, you know, whoever needs to be a part of it to communicate with me or with other councillors about getting that done.

284
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:17,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect, thank you.

285
00:49:18,096 --> 00:49:26,358
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just have a couple questions of my own on the, so we talked about federal funds.

286
00:49:26,959 --> 00:49:38,502
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that nonprofit and philanthropy in general is also in kind of a not great place to be inartful with my words.

287
00:49:40,022 --> 00:49:45,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you concerned about any of the private grants that we get not being continued?

288
00:49:46,735 --> 00:49:48,600
[SPEAKER_01]: Not at this time.

289
00:49:52,842 --> 00:49:54,463
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on the agenda.

290
00:49:54,503 --> 00:50:06,991
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess we're being told in some of the grants that we're currently even writing on some of the, we have, well, we haven't gotten to civil service yet, but we're doing a couple of grants, plans right now that are funded by the feds through FEMA.

291
00:50:07,631 --> 00:50:12,154
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've already been told we need to change some language that we're using.

292
00:50:13,295 --> 00:50:21,981
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm assuming and I'm hoping that federal private funding and foundations won't be affected by that, but.

293
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:29,943
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm guessing that might be language related to the equal rights of all human beings or something like that.

294
00:50:30,003 --> 00:50:31,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

295
00:50:31,985 --> 00:50:32,925
[SPEAKER_01]: Climate change.

296
00:50:33,466 --> 00:50:33,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

297
00:50:34,126 --> 00:50:34,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

298
00:50:35,087 --> 00:50:37,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Science and humanity.

299
00:50:42,152 --> 00:50:42,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

300
00:50:43,453 --> 00:50:50,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there, have you heard of anything regionally or kind of in the public health world space around

301
00:50:52,748 --> 00:50:58,742
[SPEAKER_05]: trying to join together and try to replace federal funds or work with other cities to apply for grants from larger foundations.

302
00:50:58,802 --> 00:51:00,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that work that you're connected with?

303
00:51:00,673 --> 00:51:01,514
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.

304
00:51:01,714 --> 00:51:03,135
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Mass Public Health Association.

305
00:51:03,155 --> 00:51:05,878
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a lot of folks are really working on this right now.

306
00:51:05,998 --> 00:51:21,031
[SPEAKER_01]: And Commissioner DPH just sent out a notification today, outlining the administration's initial budget that was put forth and what that would mean and ways that they're already keeping an eye on it.

307
00:51:21,091 --> 00:51:22,071
[SPEAKER_01]: The federal administration.

308
00:51:22,332 --> 00:51:24,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.

309
00:51:25,154 --> 00:51:28,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Did they, I'm trying to remember everything I follow,

310
00:51:29,152 --> 00:51:36,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a new law around public health in the state around funding or is that the legislature passed something around boards of health?

311
00:51:37,484 --> 00:51:37,865
[SPEAKER_05]: What, sorry?

312
00:51:39,718 --> 00:51:45,883
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yes happy to point out which is where this public health excellence grant is coming from.

313
00:51:46,063 --> 00:51:56,232
[SPEAKER_01]: And where the regulations are not regulations but where their desire to train everybody up the standards and to really get okay consistency so as far as I know that money's fine.

314
00:51:56,552 --> 00:51:57,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, and that's additional funds.

315
00:51:58,474 --> 00:51:59,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, great.

316
00:51:59,955 --> 00:52:02,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Last few things relatively small just things that you mentioned.

317
00:52:03,887 --> 00:52:08,291
[SPEAKER_05]: The ESOL classes, is that something that you are in partnership with the library on?

318
00:52:08,371 --> 00:52:08,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

319
00:52:08,691 --> 00:52:09,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

320
00:52:10,613 --> 00:52:15,837
[SPEAKER_05]: And animal control, off-hours calls, do you have any data?

321
00:52:15,937 --> 00:52:23,043
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can ask the chief when we see him, do you have any data on how often are officers responding?

322
00:52:24,205 --> 00:52:34,991
[SPEAKER_01]: I could probably get that for you and the police obviously would probably have data, but Pat does track a lot of the calls that he gets left on weekends and evenings and stuff.

323
00:52:35,011 --> 00:52:40,334
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just wondering, you know, from a- Oh, there's a lost dog or there's a, you know, yes.

324
00:52:40,474 --> 00:52:40,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

325
00:52:41,014 --> 00:52:45,897
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess like some of it, I'm just wondering how much time do we have officers out doing that?

326
00:52:46,738 --> 00:53:00,952
[SPEAKER_05]: How much is that costing us in the long run versus what it would look like to provide additional support in the health department for animal control because that might be one of those things where we're not funding it in one place and we're actually

327
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,282
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, in some ways spending more, I know it's not that simple.

328
00:53:04,302 --> 00:53:11,646
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't just transfer the money like that, but that might be an interesting thing for us to take a look at.

329
00:53:12,047 --> 00:53:15,349
[SPEAKER_05]: So more of a conversation starter than anything else.

330
00:53:15,369 --> 00:53:15,889
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

331
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:17,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lemo.

332
00:53:19,712 --> 00:53:26,956
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I personally think it's a very interesting piece of information, but it would be the police department that could answer that.

333
00:53:26,996 --> 00:53:27,837
[SPEAKER_09]: So I was just thinking about

334
00:53:28,785 --> 00:53:34,910
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm wondering if this body would be amenable to a motion to just request that information from Chief Buckley.

335
00:53:35,090 --> 00:53:38,133
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we might have it for when we have the meeting with them.

336
00:53:38,793 --> 00:53:38,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

337
00:53:39,494 --> 00:53:39,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

338
00:53:40,554 --> 00:53:53,645
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a motion to request from Chief Buckley and Medford Police data on how much time officers are spending responding to animal control issues outside of city hall hours.

339
00:53:58,153 --> 00:53:58,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

340
00:53:58,573 --> 00:54:04,635
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other questions on the health department budget and we'll jump to civil defense and then we can take any questions from members of the public.

341
00:54:07,256 --> 00:54:10,757
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing none, we'll go to civil defense.

342
00:54:11,618 --> 00:54:14,919
[SPEAKER_05]: We have maybe the first increase I've ever seen.

343
00:54:14,959 --> 00:54:17,140
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going from $9,390 to $9,840 and it looks like

344
00:54:24,455 --> 00:54:30,019
[SPEAKER_05]: We're adding a little bit for supplies, dues, conferences, and travel, and some equipment maintenance.

345
00:54:30,519 --> 00:54:34,462
[SPEAKER_05]: And with that, I'll turn it over to you.

346
00:54:34,702 --> 00:54:38,445
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, there's a little bit of a bump in the dues, conference, and travel line.

347
00:54:38,505 --> 00:54:45,370
[SPEAKER_01]: That's dues that we pay to participate in the Regional Emergency Planning Council, the REPC.

348
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:48,712
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are actual dues that we need to pay annually.

349
00:54:49,613 --> 00:54:51,774
[SPEAKER_01]: Public safety supplies and repairs and commitment.

350
00:54:54,016 --> 00:55:06,540
[SPEAKER_01]: In the midst of putting together our shelter plan we actually have a walkthrough our emergency shelter we at the Andrews middle school we actually are doing a walkthrough with some key staff tomorrow just to show what our shelter would look like how it operates what we do.

351
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:21,784
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of that's a little bump in supplies that will help you know maybe buy some blankets or pillows and stuff we have, we have cots already that have been supplied in the past to our emergency planning funding that comes through.

352
00:55:22,564 --> 00:55:32,471
[SPEAKER_01]: DPH, which comes through the feds, which comes with FEMA, which is again in jeopardy, but we do have a lot of great supplies that we've already acquired over the years.

353
00:55:33,512 --> 00:55:35,654
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is just to kind of augment some of that.

354
00:55:36,434 --> 00:55:37,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Where do we store those?

355
00:55:38,206 --> 00:55:44,432
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now all the cots are in the high school in the locker rooms that aren't being used.

356
00:55:46,514 --> 00:55:56,782
[SPEAKER_01]: But this year, through our FEP, what's called FEP funding, it's the public health emergency planning funds, we were able to acquire a trailer.

357
00:55:57,538 --> 00:56:00,401
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so we're going to be taking all the supplies and equipments that we have.

358
00:56:00,421 --> 00:56:06,005
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually have supplies here as well, which has some in the basement that are hygiene kits and stuff.

359
00:56:07,126 --> 00:56:08,608
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have kind of spread out all over.

360
00:56:08,648 --> 00:56:18,336
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have the trailer now, we'll be able to, you know, get our MRC volunteers to help us do some inventory and load up the trailer and put it all so it's ready to rock and roll when we need it.

361
00:56:19,837 --> 00:56:20,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

362
00:56:20,758 --> 00:56:22,680
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else you want to share on the civil defense front?

363
00:56:23,585 --> 00:56:25,727
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're working on our hazard mitigation plan.

364
00:56:25,767 --> 00:56:28,889
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we do have FEMA funds to complete that.

365
00:56:29,249 --> 00:56:32,651
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in the community engagement process right now, which is kind of nice.

366
00:56:32,671 --> 00:56:40,055
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the first times I think in the hazard mitigation planning history that full community engagement has been involved.

367
00:56:40,976 --> 00:56:42,597
[SPEAKER_01]: So that process is ongoing now.

368
00:56:42,637 --> 00:56:50,482
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing some surveying and it's probably a year long process, but hopefully it'll be done by the end of next fiscal year.

369
00:56:51,467 --> 00:56:51,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

370
00:56:51,607 --> 00:56:54,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have any questions on civil defense from members of the council?

371
00:56:57,391 --> 00:56:58,152
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing none.

372
00:56:58,172 --> 00:57:04,797
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have any questions from members of the public or comments from members of the public for the Board of Health or Civil Defense?

373
00:57:09,461 --> 00:57:11,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing none in person and no hands on Zoom.

374
00:57:12,063 --> 00:57:12,603
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

375
00:57:12,763 --> 00:57:13,183
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

376
00:57:13,344 --> 00:57:13,904
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

377
00:57:13,924 --> 00:57:14,925
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a good evening.

378
00:57:16,966 --> 00:57:18,888
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we'll go to facilities.

379
00:57:27,083 --> 00:57:28,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome, thanks for being here.

380
00:57:29,845 --> 00:57:39,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Just gonna quickly read off the budget change, and then you can, I'll read the kind of conversation prompts, and then we can go from there.

381
00:57:41,055 --> 00:57:42,897
[SPEAKER_05]: We have facilities, fiscal 25 budget, 1,838,745.

382
00:57:42,937 --> 00:57:43,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Fiscal 26 proposed, 1,933,393.

383
00:57:43,357 --> 00:57:44,218
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a change of 94,648.

384
00:57:56,088 --> 00:58:10,111
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a cola increase for the permanent employee, and we have some changes and increases in supplier costs for fuel, utilities, janitorial supplies, and increases in our contracts for HVAC and cleaning.

385
00:58:11,432 --> 00:58:19,794
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that, I'll turn it over to you to talk about what the changes in the budget, some of your highlights from the previous year, plans for the year ahead, and

386
00:58:21,859 --> 00:58:27,841
[SPEAKER_05]: what is a project or a priority that's not funded this year that you think needs to be funded in the future?

387
00:58:28,302 --> 00:58:35,504
[SPEAKER_08]: So the budget reflects my best guesstimate of what costs are going to be rising.

388
00:58:36,585 --> 00:58:40,526
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually had my first vendor that had to increase price due to tariffs.

389
00:58:41,287 --> 00:58:49,670
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's a big fear that prices will start rising for certain commodities that we need to

390
00:58:50,450 --> 00:58:51,231
[SPEAKER_08]: run the buildings.

391
00:58:52,472 --> 00:58:57,676
[SPEAKER_08]: The HVAC and the cleaning contract are built in that they will rise every year.

392
00:58:57,736 --> 00:59:01,499
[SPEAKER_08]: They're very limited, but those costs do go up.

393
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:04,941
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, it's something we're monitoring.

394
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:22,291
[SPEAKER_08]: Right now I am a department of one, but next fiscal year it's not reflected in my budget, but the maintenance worker at the library and the senior center will start reporting to me so there's a better line of communication on building repairs.

395
00:59:23,391 --> 00:59:38,335
[SPEAKER_08]: so we can start building a more holistic approach to building repairs and provide more support for those two individuals, along with the person that's part-time at the Chevalier.

396
00:59:38,375 --> 00:59:48,857
[SPEAKER_08]: So that will be a settling change of the way we're doing things, but I think it'll be a benefit for everybody when we do that.

397
00:59:49,775 --> 00:59:52,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Just really quickly, is the intent maybe in the future to move them over?

398
00:59:52,716 --> 00:59:59,858
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think the intent would be then to move the budget over so it'd be truly a part of the facilities department.

399
01:00:01,238 --> 01:00:06,299
[SPEAKER_08]: But it was a request I made, and that I think will help the city in the long run.

400
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:12,961
[SPEAKER_08]: Some projects that I think we completed successfully, one of the LED lights here at City Hall.

401
01:00:13,481 --> 01:00:18,123
[SPEAKER_08]: I've already seen the energy bills go down since we've installed them.

402
01:00:19,463 --> 01:00:21,064
[SPEAKER_08]: It's much brighter in City Hall.

403
01:00:21,204 --> 01:00:25,185
[SPEAKER_08]: The Council Chambers is one example how it's changed the look.

404
01:00:25,645 --> 01:00:26,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we can see everything.

405
01:00:26,846 --> 01:00:31,968
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, in some ways that might not be a good thing, but we can see better.

406
01:00:34,989 --> 01:00:46,153
[SPEAKER_08]: And the windows which are in progress, it unfortunately will look messy as we're doing this, but the vendor for the curtains and the shades is

407
01:00:46,742 --> 01:00:51,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Happily making them and so those will start once those start getting installed.

408
01:00:52,529 --> 01:01:05,125
[SPEAKER_08]: The chambers will look back to the way it should replacing windows and three fire stations was very helpful for those fire stations, we are in the process of renovating a bathroom at.

409
01:01:07,062 --> 01:01:11,527
[SPEAKER_08]: engine four, so that's a great thing to be able to do that.

410
01:01:12,248 --> 01:01:19,215
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if anybody uses the Chevalier, but we've been replacing the inside lighting with LED lighting.

411
01:01:19,775 --> 01:01:27,283
[SPEAKER_08]: We've put a new kind of lighting up top that can do multiple colors, can actually be an enhancement with the show.

412
01:01:27,783 --> 01:01:30,884
[SPEAKER_08]: Blumenreich is very happy with that.

413
01:01:31,904 --> 01:01:34,445
[SPEAKER_08]: So that will be completed soon.

414
01:01:34,505 --> 01:01:41,967
[SPEAKER_08]: We also put video signage outside the Chevalier Theatre to help advertise shows and bring people into the theatre.

415
01:01:43,227 --> 01:01:46,228
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw the sign for Kid Ninja the other day.

416
01:01:46,308 --> 01:01:47,328
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the first one I'd seen.

417
01:01:49,005 --> 01:02:10,549
[SPEAKER_08]: Projects I'm looking at for the future is one, I really want to start the renovations of the bathrooms here at City Hall, convert two of them into total ADA compliant bathrooms on the first floor, and then continue that project all the way through City Hall so our bathrooms can be up to date.

418
01:02:10,789 --> 01:02:11,530
[SPEAKER_08]: Even the one up here?

419
01:02:11,550 --> 01:02:12,550
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you know about that one?

420
01:02:12,630 --> 01:02:13,250
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that one.

421
01:02:14,191 --> 01:02:16,135
[SPEAKER_08]: They were looking at that to be my office.

422
01:02:16,495 --> 01:02:17,517
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that very well.

423
01:02:17,537 --> 01:02:18,579
[SPEAKER_08]: Talk about facilities.

424
01:02:18,679 --> 01:02:18,740
Yes.

425
01:02:24,078 --> 01:02:25,659
[SPEAKER_08]: So that would be good.

426
01:02:25,739 --> 01:02:34,801
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'd also like to replace the carpet here in the council chambers and complete the finishing of the council chambers.

427
01:02:35,401 --> 01:02:38,122
[SPEAKER_05]: You're taking a question out of my mouth.

428
01:02:38,262 --> 01:02:48,225
[SPEAKER_08]: Working with DPW, we have headquarters and a Riverside Ave fire station that needs some desperate needed road work.

429
01:02:48,285 --> 01:02:52,026
[SPEAKER_08]: So I may be coming for funding to get those projects underway.

430
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:54,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

431
01:02:57,222 --> 01:03:01,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Any questions from members of the council for Director Riggi and the Facilities Department?

432
01:03:01,525 --> 01:03:06,149
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, I just have a couple really quick ones.

433
01:03:08,270 --> 01:03:14,575
[SPEAKER_05]: We should think, I mean, I definitely agree the carpets in here are in need of replacement.

434
01:03:16,076 --> 01:03:16,816
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what's under them.

435
01:03:16,836 --> 01:03:17,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know what's under them?

436
01:03:19,330 --> 01:03:21,631
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if I really want to look.

437
01:03:24,233 --> 01:03:26,055
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm hoping it's something good, not something bad.

438
01:03:26,115 --> 01:03:32,900
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, I mean, I would love that it's a flooring that could actually be reused.

439
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:34,381
[SPEAKER_05]: He thinks it might be hardwood under there.

440
01:03:34,441 --> 01:03:34,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

441
01:03:34,981 --> 01:03:44,268
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, if it was a flooring that could be repurposed and reused, I think it would be something that would be worth exploring.

442
01:03:44,615 --> 01:03:44,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

443
01:03:45,316 --> 01:03:51,665
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just think, obviously, this is tentative on the decision of the voters, if there's a charter change.

444
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:55,102
[SPEAKER_05]: we're going to have to change this.

445
01:03:55,483 --> 01:03:58,045
[SPEAKER_08]: I've already started trying to figure that out.

446
01:03:58,265 --> 01:03:59,146
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, great.

447
01:03:59,527 --> 01:04:00,648
[SPEAKER_05]: We'd love to coordinate on that.

448
01:04:01,509 --> 01:04:02,209
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd love to coordinate that.

449
01:04:02,229 --> 01:04:03,470
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure everyone has an opinion.

450
01:04:04,411 --> 01:04:07,374
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll see if it happens or not.

451
01:04:07,494 --> 01:04:09,756
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's a significant change.

452
01:04:12,259 --> 01:04:15,322
[SPEAKER_05]: I noticed that the utilities actuals are really high.

453
01:04:17,908 --> 01:04:19,149
[SPEAKER_08]: That was due to natural gas.

454
01:04:20,029 --> 01:04:24,412
[SPEAKER_08]: Natural gas exploded with what national grid did.

455
01:04:25,032 --> 01:04:31,335
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was paying probably three times the amount that I was last year at the same time.

456
01:04:31,435 --> 01:04:43,462
[SPEAKER_08]: So that the usage was the same or a little bit less, but the cost of that was something that we were not expecting and nobody forecast that.

457
01:04:43,922 --> 01:04:46,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that, in your estimation, is that coming back down?

458
01:04:47,243 --> 01:05:04,689
[SPEAKER_08]: It's come back down, but whether they're saying that it may go up again, I know the state regulators are working with them because the costs, I think, were prohibitive for a lot of residents as opposed to cities and towns and businesses.

459
01:05:04,769 --> 01:05:10,491
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think holistically, they're looking at everything and seeing how they can keep those costs down.

460
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:13,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you expecting that we'll be in a deficit for this fiscal year?

461
01:05:13,912 --> 01:05:16,433
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a feeling, yes, we will.

462
01:05:16,533 --> 01:05:27,738
[SPEAKER_08]: And I notice it's up $30,000, but is that something that... I'd say maybe $50,000, but it's hard to project.

463
01:05:27,758 --> 01:05:28,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

464
01:05:33,853 --> 01:05:45,008
[SPEAKER_05]: Just in the kind of, I know we've been working really hard and the existence of your department is like a shared services consolidated services model, and I know IT has been working on that as well.

465
01:05:46,330 --> 01:05:50,176
[SPEAKER_05]: You mentioned the maintenance staff, that sounds like a good

466
01:05:51,193 --> 01:05:52,254
[SPEAKER_05]: a good change.

467
01:05:52,314 --> 01:05:57,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there anything else that's still kind of hanging out there from a maintenance perspective?

468
01:05:57,638 --> 01:06:06,885
[SPEAKER_08]: What I think we need to explore is if we have one or full-time basically handyman

469
01:06:07,766 --> 01:06:18,316
[SPEAKER_08]: that are employed by the city because I get a lot of requests from fire stations and city hall, you know, there's a loose toilet seat or light bulb needs to be replaced.

470
01:06:18,536 --> 01:06:31,048
[SPEAKER_08]: And if we had our in-house staff, I think we may be able to reduce costs because right now I have to go out to a plumber or a contractor to, you know, fix a simple door.

471
01:06:31,888 --> 01:06:33,629
[SPEAKER_08]: or sometimes I'm doing it myself.

472
01:06:33,729 --> 01:06:48,719
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think we need to look at if that's something we can we can employ in the city and they can go to the various to the 18 buildings that you know I'm responsible for and do that kind of work and reduce costs from our outside vendors.

473
01:06:49,179 --> 01:06:49,399
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

474
01:06:51,410 --> 01:07:00,055
[SPEAKER_05]: And last thing, outside of the HVAC and cleaning, what is funded in the building repair line?

475
01:07:00,255 --> 01:07:20,686
[SPEAKER_08]: Building repair is basically everything and anything I do, pest control, plumbing services, electricians, fire alarm, fire alarm repair, elevators, roof repairs, everything that would come into the facilities goes into that budget line.

476
01:07:21,195 --> 01:07:22,516
[SPEAKER_05]: How many of our buildings have elevators?

477
01:07:24,577 --> 01:07:32,762
[SPEAKER_08]: This building, library, Chevalier, and then the Brooks Estate.

478
01:07:34,764 --> 01:07:35,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Police has one.

479
01:07:35,564 --> 01:07:36,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Do the fire stations?

480
01:07:36,165 --> 01:07:36,785
[SPEAKER_08]: Police have one.

481
01:07:36,825 --> 01:07:39,867
[SPEAKER_08]: The fire stations has been out.

482
01:07:40,307 --> 01:07:41,448
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not used anymore.

483
01:07:41,568 --> 01:07:42,649
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not being inspected.

484
01:07:42,949 --> 01:07:43,609
[SPEAKER_08]: It's out of service.

485
01:07:44,050 --> 01:07:45,551
[SPEAKER_05]: And is that just South Menford or?

486
01:07:46,671 --> 01:07:48,552
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, the fire station?

487
01:07:48,853 --> 01:07:49,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

488
01:07:49,726 --> 01:07:52,368
[SPEAKER_08]: No, the only one is only headquarters.

489
01:07:52,428 --> 01:07:54,069
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, yeah, there's no other fire station.

490
01:07:54,369 --> 01:07:54,630
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

491
01:07:56,131 --> 01:07:56,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

492
01:07:56,811 --> 01:08:01,114
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's all I had seen Matt main counseling.

493
01:08:02,775 --> 01:08:03,396
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

494
01:08:04,016 --> 01:08:11,041
[SPEAKER_09]: Could you just if the charter does pass and we have to make seven seats into 11 I'm just looking for a guesstimate here.

495
01:08:11,622 --> 01:08:14,204
[SPEAKER_09]: What like how much do you think that that would cost total?

496
01:08:15,492 --> 01:08:23,695
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I think first I have to really look at this, the way it's set up now would not be able to be expanded or anything.

497
01:08:23,775 --> 01:08:38,041
[SPEAKER_08]: So basically it would try to reimagine the whole area of how we would do 11 Councilors with the president sitting at the head.

498
01:08:38,641 --> 01:08:40,362
[SPEAKER_08]: So it may be a two-tier,

499
01:08:41,701 --> 01:08:46,983
[SPEAKER_08]: system, kind of what it is now, but in a different configuration.

500
01:08:47,503 --> 01:09:01,407
[SPEAKER_08]: So I really have to start working with a designer on that to figure out what is the best optimization of any space, because I don't envision this being expanded back.

501
01:09:02,027 --> 01:09:08,489
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're really back towards the audience, because you need that space.

502
01:09:09,189 --> 01:09:19,394
[SPEAKER_08]: So to how to revision and having the handicap lift there, which we need, you know, limits some of the space that we have to go to do it.

503
01:09:20,015 --> 01:09:20,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

504
01:09:20,495 --> 01:09:25,938
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think too, there's some functionality elements and obviously design elements of screens.

505
01:09:26,998 --> 01:09:30,200
[SPEAKER_05]: And this layout is actually really difficult for

506
01:09:31,243 --> 01:09:32,443
[SPEAKER_05]: interactive or panel.

507
01:09:33,824 --> 01:09:37,945
[SPEAKER_05]: And it obviously divides the room in a way that you can't use this space as actually.

508
01:09:38,125 --> 01:09:41,726
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it needs to be done the correct way, since this is a historic chamber.

509
01:09:41,826 --> 01:09:44,087
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have to keep with that.

510
01:09:44,107 --> 01:09:52,430
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we can't do something modern, we would need to keep with within the confines of what exists now.

511
01:09:52,710 --> 01:09:56,871
[SPEAKER_09]: So what's the minimum that you think it could cost?

512
01:09:57,051 --> 01:09:59,132
[SPEAKER_09]: And what's the most you think it could cost?

513
01:09:59,630 --> 01:10:08,615
[SPEAKER_08]: I would hope it would be under $100,000, but don't quote me on that, because construction materials are one of the materials that are rising every day.

514
01:10:08,635 --> 01:10:14,559
[SPEAKER_08]: And if we're using wood, that's something that is rising right now.

515
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:19,642
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's what the catcher here is.

516
01:10:20,382 --> 01:10:21,683
[SPEAKER_09]: So under $100,000.

517
01:10:22,183 --> 01:10:24,545
[SPEAKER_09]: So you don't think it would be in the million dollar

518
01:10:25,364 --> 01:10:26,084
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think so.

519
01:10:26,264 --> 01:10:32,325
[SPEAKER_08]: And if it was, I would go to a different designer and say, no, sorry, we're not doing that.

520
01:10:32,385 --> 01:10:34,406
[SPEAKER_09]: So why did the windows cost around?

521
01:10:34,806 --> 01:10:38,146
[SPEAKER_08]: Because those were a total historic preservation.

522
01:10:38,286 --> 01:10:45,348
[SPEAKER_08]: So basically, they are the windows that were put into the building when the building was built.

523
01:10:45,748 --> 01:10:47,088
[SPEAKER_08]: They are the windows that came out.

524
01:10:47,808 --> 01:10:51,509
[SPEAKER_08]: But every piece of glass has been reglazed.

525
01:10:53,246 --> 01:11:00,189
[SPEAKER_08]: You cannot tell it, but I'd say anywhere from 50 to 60% of the wood on these windows is now brand new.

526
01:11:00,949 --> 01:11:06,491
[SPEAKER_08]: But the way it is done, it's to preserve the look and the means.

527
01:11:06,591 --> 01:11:14,574
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's why it was so costly because as opposed to just taking them in and replacing the glass, it had to be period glass.

528
01:11:14,654 --> 01:11:15,995
[SPEAKER_08]: It had to be the right size.

529
01:11:16,615 --> 01:11:21,517
[SPEAKER_08]: All the wood, the fans on the top had to be exactly the same.

530
01:11:22,645 --> 01:11:23,626
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, thank you.

531
01:11:25,608 --> 01:11:27,431
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

532
01:11:28,552 --> 01:11:36,061
[SPEAKER_07]: Just going off of that line, I, I know some voters would want to have the most information possible before voting on the question in the fall.

533
01:11:36,781 --> 01:11:42,308
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you're super busy, but is there a way that we could get a more solid estimate by election time.

534
01:11:42,756 --> 01:11:54,687
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm working with our house doctor and a couple of other cost estimates so I can see if they can come in and look at this and give us maybe a sketch and a ballpark figure on a cost.

535
01:11:54,948 --> 01:11:55,208
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

536
01:11:55,528 --> 01:12:00,293
[SPEAKER_05]: If you wouldn't mind including me in some way so I can convey.

537
01:12:00,373 --> 01:12:01,594
[SPEAKER_08]: I can include you on the email.

538
01:12:01,934 --> 01:12:02,155
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

539
01:12:04,637 --> 01:12:06,399
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further questions on facilities?

540
01:12:09,207 --> 01:12:13,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing none, are there any members of the public who would like to make a comment on the facilities budget?

541
01:12:16,633 --> 01:12:19,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing none in the chambers and no hands on Zoom, thank you very much.

542
01:12:22,197 --> 01:12:26,300
[SPEAKER_05]: IT, Information Technology.

543
01:12:27,782 --> 01:12:29,943
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Director Rich Lane with us.

544
01:12:29,963 --> 01:12:32,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have a presentation?

545
01:12:32,245 --> 01:12:34,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that why you joined our Zoom?

546
01:12:34,607 --> 01:12:35,668
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't I have one last year?

547
01:12:35,828 --> 01:12:36,168
[SPEAKER_05]: You did.

548
01:12:37,009 --> 01:12:38,150
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I never know.

549
01:12:39,913 --> 01:12:42,114
[SPEAKER_05]: We can make you a co host, Mr. Clark.

550
01:12:42,594 --> 01:12:43,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you already did.

551
01:12:44,295 --> 01:12:47,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

552
01:12:47,476 --> 01:12:54,478
[SPEAKER_05]: And I will just very quickly read off my thing before you start your screen share, but we are looking at a budget increase from 357,000 to 360,000 or so $2,891.

553
01:13:01,381 --> 01:13:09,823
[SPEAKER_05]: and that is there's a COLA increase and a travel reimbursement increase for some travel between the buildings.

554
01:13:11,023 --> 01:13:12,504
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, go ahead.

555
01:13:12,964 --> 01:13:13,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

556
01:13:13,444 --> 01:13:15,904
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think your presentation will cover what's the change?

557
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:17,385
[SPEAKER_06]: It's gonna cover it all my friend.

558
01:13:17,445 --> 01:13:18,185
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, lovely.

559
01:13:19,425 --> 01:13:20,206
[SPEAKER_06]: We do this together.

560
01:13:20,866 --> 01:13:23,366
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me share, see if I remember how to use Zoom, it's been a while.

561
01:13:27,747 --> 01:13:30,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Be careful, they'll start having to do a presentation for everybody.

562
01:13:31,696 --> 01:13:33,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you said I could go first last year.

563
01:13:33,497 --> 01:13:33,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Did I?

564
01:13:33,897 --> 01:13:34,518
[SPEAKER_05]: Did I?

565
01:13:34,738 --> 01:13:34,958
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

566
01:13:35,418 --> 01:13:35,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Oof.

567
01:13:37,199 --> 01:13:37,800
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

568
01:13:37,860 --> 01:13:38,540
[SPEAKER_05]: It's rough, isn't it?

569
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:39,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Third.

570
01:13:40,622 --> 01:13:42,563
[SPEAKER_05]: How long did we make you wait this year compared to last year?

571
01:13:43,143 --> 01:13:46,845
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't as bad, but it was dark out last year.

572
01:13:47,386 --> 01:13:51,048
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just me and Nita last year, actually, left at the end.

573
01:13:51,528 --> 01:13:53,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's just the two of you again, but at least it's bright.

574
01:13:53,770 --> 01:13:54,450
[SPEAKER_05]: She's a good sport.

575
01:13:54,490 --> 01:13:56,351
[SPEAKER_05]: She always takes the last one, so.

576
01:13:56,451 --> 01:13:57,432
[SPEAKER_05]: And she offered that again.

577
01:13:57,892 --> 01:13:57,992
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

578
01:13:58,032 --> 01:13:58,733
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate...

579
01:13:59,951 --> 01:14:01,212
[SPEAKER_05]: We incremental improvement.

580
01:14:01,392 --> 01:14:02,353
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.

581
01:14:02,813 --> 01:14:03,214
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

582
01:14:03,254 --> 01:14:06,336
[SPEAKER_06]: So here we are for fiscal year 26 talking about it.

583
01:14:06,356 --> 01:14:09,299
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like we did this like a year ago, but we'll do it again.

584
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:11,921
[SPEAKER_06]: Just quick agenda.

585
01:14:11,961 --> 01:14:19,567
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll go over high level, what I've done, what I'm planning to do, what the budget looks like, and then some possible concerns that we could run into things like that.

586
01:14:21,830 --> 01:14:29,496
[SPEAKER_06]: So capital project update, you know, until you write it down, you don't realize how many of them you have, that you're trying to manage at once, but there's about seven of them.

587
01:14:30,697 --> 01:14:41,905
[SPEAKER_06]: We're making progress, not as fast as I would like, but, you know, we're beholden to other vendors, market conditions, getting, you know, materials, things like that, that just

588
01:14:42,543 --> 01:14:50,833
[SPEAKER_06]: don't always align the right way, because a lot of these projects actually relate to each other and rely on certain milestones to move the next milestone forward.

589
01:14:51,353 --> 01:14:52,775
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're getting there.

590
01:14:52,855 --> 01:14:53,696
[SPEAKER_06]: We're getting there.

591
01:14:53,736 --> 01:14:55,418
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel good about where we're at right now.

592
01:14:56,517 --> 01:15:03,319
[SPEAKER_06]: We've hit a couple of snags and a few projects but we're ironing them out, and we're gonna continue to move forward when all this is done.

593
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:07,540
[SPEAKER_06]: This lays the infrastructure for the city for the next 25 years.

594
01:15:08,321 --> 01:15:09,621
[SPEAKER_06]: From a technology standpoint.

595
01:15:10,381 --> 01:15:14,242
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I wanted to take these on they needed to get done most communities have already done a lot of these.

596
01:15:17,872 --> 01:15:27,216
[SPEAKER_06]: late in a way in that technologies have advanced, you know, we have better things we can do going forward easier without upgrades and things like that.

597
01:15:27,436 --> 01:15:30,198
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it worked out well from the timing.

598
01:15:30,218 --> 01:15:32,619
[SPEAKER_06]: A couple of them to call out the

599
01:15:34,150 --> 01:15:40,236
[SPEAKER_06]: Zetron system, which is the fire department's alerting system, switching lights on, radio calls, lets them know where to go.

600
01:15:41,897 --> 01:15:44,259
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really a next generation system for them.

601
01:15:44,359 --> 01:15:48,723
[SPEAKER_06]: The system they have now is nearly 20 years old, so there's a lot of limitations to it.

602
01:15:49,604 --> 01:15:53,708
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we're always concerned about staffing and how do we augment staff with technology.

603
01:15:54,428 --> 01:15:55,728
[SPEAKER_06]: This is one of the ways we can do it.

604
01:15:55,748 --> 01:15:58,669
[SPEAKER_06]: It helps the call center, the 911 center.

605
01:15:59,669 --> 01:16:08,451
[SPEAKER_06]: It automates a lot of things for them so that the people there can focus on who's on the phone in distress instead of typing in a bunch of archaic commands to keyboards and stuff.

606
01:16:09,031 --> 01:16:13,892
[SPEAKER_06]: And it gives us more flexibility on how we work the alerting system for each fire station.

607
01:16:13,912 --> 01:16:16,552
[SPEAKER_06]: We can open doors automatically, things like that.

608
01:16:17,452 --> 01:16:21,313
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm really happy to see that that's going forward really well.

609
01:16:22,093 --> 01:16:30,500
[SPEAKER_06]: And then one of the big projects that touched a lot of people's lives that I work with was recabling the entire building here for networking.

610
01:16:31,321 --> 01:16:32,542
[SPEAKER_06]: It was quite a project.

611
01:16:32,742 --> 01:16:39,767
[SPEAKER_06]: We started the week of Thanksgiving, we finished early April, but my crew that I had every day showed up at 6am.

612
01:16:41,128 --> 01:16:43,470
[SPEAKER_06]: went to work, they're consummate professionals.

613
01:16:43,550 --> 01:16:46,613
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't be happy with the work they did and the way it came out.

614
01:16:47,314 --> 01:16:48,995
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we just need to finish the project.

615
01:16:49,556 --> 01:16:53,960
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the network piece that's under design right now.

616
01:16:54,460 --> 01:17:01,206
[SPEAKER_06]: So right now our network is very archaic, the way we run it, the way we protect it, the way it works and the service it provides.

617
01:17:01,726 --> 01:17:05,730
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be able to build a modern network architecture that'll serve us for years to come.

618
01:17:06,858 --> 01:17:09,819
[SPEAKER_06]: And then just other things like replacing phone system.

619
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:19,964
[SPEAKER_06]: That's already had a great sort of response from the outside and all the outside buildings like DPW, Council of Aging, library.

620
01:17:20,384 --> 01:17:23,905
[SPEAKER_06]: They're all super happy with the flexibility provides them, the things they can do with it.

621
01:17:24,685 --> 01:17:29,587
[SPEAKER_06]: We can manage it ourselves now for the most part, but we also have the provider two seconds away.

622
01:17:29,607 --> 01:17:30,888
[SPEAKER_06]: Every time I call, they pick up the phone.

623
01:17:31,529 --> 01:17:33,412
[SPEAKER_06]: where a car provider doesn't really do that.

624
01:17:34,474 --> 01:17:36,879
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a lot of cool things that you can do with it.

625
01:17:36,899 --> 01:17:38,402
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a mobile app so you can

626
01:17:39,194 --> 01:17:44,258
[SPEAKER_06]: put the mobile app on, have it look like your desk phone, so you're out in the field, so fiber prevention.

627
01:17:45,119 --> 01:17:49,502
[SPEAKER_06]: They love that because they're out all day doing inspections, but they're waiting on contractors to call them.

628
01:17:49,862 --> 01:17:52,965
[SPEAKER_06]: They have to drive back to the office, check for messages, drive back out to the field.

629
01:17:53,025 --> 01:17:57,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Now it's just like the guy calls them, hey, I'm five minutes away, I'll be right over, get it done, makes it more efficient.

630
01:17:58,229 --> 01:18:01,271
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's things like that we're always looking to do within technology.

631
01:18:03,793 --> 01:18:04,773
[SPEAKER_06]: It's sometimes hard.

632
01:18:04,813 --> 01:18:06,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, you have to weigh cost versus benefit.

633
01:18:07,394 --> 01:18:10,736
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think we do a lot with a very small amount of money.

634
01:18:10,816 --> 01:18:12,576
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm pretty proud of that.

635
01:18:12,596 --> 01:18:16,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, come on now.

636
01:18:18,642 --> 01:18:19,562
[SPEAKER_06]: So the budget itself.

637
01:18:20,062 --> 01:18:22,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's reasonably pretty much looks exactly like it did last year.

638
01:18:22,823 --> 01:18:39,008
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I made the commitment to not trying to add anything or ask for anything else I try to want to do, you know, more with less and less being that cost just go up as everybody comes up here and says you know support costs, just software support alone went up anywhere from eight to 13%.

639
01:18:40,828 --> 01:18:43,711
[SPEAKER_06]: But I will work around that and make it work inside my budget.

640
01:18:45,112 --> 01:18:51,597
[SPEAKER_06]: We probably will, next year or the year after, have to sit down and have some conversations about some expiring contracts that I locked in.

641
01:18:51,617 --> 01:18:53,218
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll get to this in a minute.

642
01:18:53,298 --> 01:18:57,642
[SPEAKER_06]: I locked in a lot of contracts because I could see the future coming because I've been through this before in my career.

643
01:18:58,782 --> 01:19:00,404
[SPEAKER_06]: But they will expire at some point.

644
01:19:00,424 --> 01:19:03,686
[SPEAKER_06]: So we probably will have costs increase in some places.

645
01:19:07,349 --> 01:19:07,649
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.

646
01:19:08,665 --> 01:19:27,262
[SPEAKER_06]: So savings we continue to look for savings wherever we can get them, working with other department heads, what they what they're doing you know they're have technology in the field, how can we reduce those costs can we combine contracts which gives us more leverage to go back and say hey look we consume a lot of your products, you need to give us a better discount and make the price more palatable for us.

647
01:19:28,182 --> 01:19:29,142
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've been doing that.

648
01:19:30,623 --> 01:19:32,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Staffing costs, we continue to save on that.

649
01:19:32,963 --> 01:19:34,703
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll have myself in the back a little bit.

650
01:19:35,243 --> 01:19:37,764
[SPEAKER_06]: A community this size does not have an IT department of one.

651
01:19:38,224 --> 01:19:40,564
[SPEAKER_06]: It's usually an IT department of anywhere from five to eight.

652
01:19:41,144 --> 01:19:47,186
[SPEAKER_06]: So somewhere in the $300,000 to $500,000 a year savings just because I'm generally good at my job.

653
01:19:48,366 --> 01:19:50,406
[SPEAKER_06]: None of my peers in the communities know how I do it.

654
01:19:51,266 --> 01:19:53,967
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, so I'm pretty happy with that.

655
01:19:55,287 --> 01:19:57,828
[SPEAKER_06]: At the end of last year, like I said, I locked in a bunch of contracts.

656
01:19:57,848 --> 01:19:59,229
[SPEAKER_06]: I also bought hardware.

657
01:20:00,089 --> 01:20:08,352
[SPEAKER_06]: The biggest chunk of hardware we need for the network and city network, I bought that last year because I knew there was an election going on and things were going to change.

658
01:20:08,772 --> 01:20:14,655
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, look, let me pay for it this year, purchase it, and then we won't implement the next year.

659
01:20:15,155 --> 01:20:18,216
[SPEAKER_06]: It probably saved us about $100,000 just doing that alone.

660
01:20:19,077 --> 01:20:22,118
[SPEAKER_06]: And then desktops and laptops, buying a bunch at the end of the year.

661
01:20:22,933 --> 01:20:27,978
[SPEAKER_06]: I think really helped us a lot because everything's gone up by about 25% as far as hardware across the board.

662
01:20:27,998 --> 01:20:33,082
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's going to go up a lot more before it starts to come down.

663
01:20:33,122 --> 01:20:35,104
[SPEAKER_06]: It always goes up a lot faster than it comes down.

664
01:20:35,184 --> 01:20:40,389
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would be looking at the end of the year before I'd feel like it's cost effective, which would put me six months behind on my product.

665
01:20:40,409 --> 01:20:42,651
[SPEAKER_06]: So you see why I kind of would do something like that.

666
01:20:45,218 --> 01:20:50,224
[SPEAKER_06]: And then risk factors, you always have to figure out what are the single points of failure or what have you.

667
01:20:51,025 --> 01:20:55,150
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you talked to Bob Dickinson about what happens if he gets run over by a bus.

668
01:20:55,410 --> 01:20:57,413
[SPEAKER_06]: And you were trying to find an elegant way of saying that.

669
01:20:57,453 --> 01:21:00,497
[SPEAKER_06]: But I like the run over by the bus theory because there's a lot of them run through the parking lots.

670
01:21:02,277 --> 01:21:04,998
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, it is a risk being a one-man shop.

671
01:21:05,258 --> 01:21:07,519
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a lot of the institutional knowledge now.

672
01:21:07,879 --> 01:21:09,059
[SPEAKER_06]: I document everything.

673
01:21:09,559 --> 01:21:14,260
[SPEAKER_06]: We have MSP we work for, for low level tasks, like help desk, things like that.

674
01:21:14,820 --> 01:21:17,381
[SPEAKER_06]: But they're not the decision makers.

675
01:21:17,401 --> 01:21:21,922
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not able to like really transform and guide and come up and lead big projects.

676
01:21:23,002 --> 01:21:26,063
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, so that is certainly a risk, you know, whatever.

677
01:21:27,384 --> 01:21:28,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Cyber attack is always a risk.

678
01:21:28,786 --> 01:21:32,531
[SPEAKER_06]: We've had two communities get hit in the last couple of months pretty hard.

679
01:21:33,512 --> 01:21:39,439
[SPEAKER_06]: We've had a couple of small incidents here, but fortunately we're pretty on top of that sort of stuff.

680
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:41,021
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will say this.

681
01:21:42,590 --> 01:21:49,535
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never worked in an organization, I won't offend any of my coworkers, where the technological sophistication is where it's at.

682
01:21:50,055 --> 01:21:53,177
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'll tell you what, you tell them, this is what it looks like.

683
01:21:53,658 --> 01:21:56,240
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have a question, just call and they will do it.

684
01:21:56,260 --> 01:21:57,701
[SPEAKER_06]: And they've been fantastic about it.

685
01:21:57,721 --> 01:22:08,168
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think we've avoided a lot of situations that other communities would have just by the people here being very responsive to coaching and kind of like asking the question if they're just in doubt.

686
01:22:10,288 --> 01:22:21,157
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, you know, digital transformation, if, you know, it's hard to, you know, I throw the seven products I'm managing, I know we'd like to get a lot of other things going, like, you know, a new finance system would be a great thing.

687
01:22:21,217 --> 01:22:31,866
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it involves me a lot, not from a GL decision-making standpoint, just the technology, how do we support it, back it up, make it, you know, performant and available, that kind of thing.

688
01:22:31,886 --> 01:22:32,246
[SPEAKER_06]: So,

689
01:22:34,270 --> 01:22:53,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully as more of these big ticket foundational products get off my plate, I can start to help other other departments with where they want to go where they want to be type of thing and I think we need, I need to be more proactive and like in this course working with Nina is a big proponent of this and she's been great about it is.

690
01:22:55,067 --> 01:23:01,858
[SPEAKER_06]: How do we step back and think about somebody wants to do something in the department, how do we make that work for every department, because it probably they do similar things.

691
01:23:02,339 --> 01:23:09,190
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to get out of the methodology of being siloed and everyone does a one off and so we want to try to raise that up in the future and get better at that.

692
01:23:11,302 --> 01:23:13,184
[SPEAKER_06]: So future projects, you asked about that.

693
01:23:13,204 --> 01:23:27,536
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the things I'd love to do, and this goes back to when I was a resident of Medford, is I don't feel like I should ever have to get off the couch to pay a bill or interact with the city from a paperwork, permitting, you know, pay a ticket, get a dog license.

694
01:23:27,637 --> 01:23:29,158
[SPEAKER_06]: I should be able to stay at home and do it all.

695
01:23:29,958 --> 01:23:32,579
[SPEAKER_06]: And the biggest reason for that is accessibility, right?

696
01:23:32,599 --> 01:23:35,460
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a lot of elderly people, we have people with disabilities.

697
01:23:36,441 --> 01:23:43,284
[SPEAKER_06]: They should be able to interact with the city the way any of us can that can walk into this building and go to offices and go upstairs and what have you.

698
01:23:44,104 --> 01:23:46,565
[SPEAKER_06]: But what it really brings a lot of other things is easy reporting.

699
01:23:46,605 --> 01:23:48,886
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I know Matt's a data guy.

700
01:23:48,906 --> 01:23:58,890
[SPEAKER_06]: If he wants to ask like, you know, how many permits, you know, do we fulfill last year for this certain thing and what dollar value in over what timeframe by each quarter?

701
01:23:59,787 --> 01:24:06,169
[SPEAKER_06]: We really can't answer that question easily would have to go to a lot of paper, a lot of spreadsheets and try to aggregate it.

702
01:24:06,850 --> 01:24:09,371
[SPEAKER_06]: If we were all electronic in this way, push a button.

703
01:24:09,391 --> 01:24:10,851
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

704
01:24:11,011 --> 01:24:18,374
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, revenue generation, we probably miss a lot of revenue just by things falling through the cracks not following up on things like fines or whatever.

705
01:24:19,274 --> 01:24:22,075
[SPEAKER_06]: They get on pieces of paper and get stuck behind something else.

706
01:24:22,535 --> 01:24:26,556
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have a better picture on how much money you're bringing in, and you collect more money.

707
01:24:26,576 --> 01:24:33,638
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been proven in numerous communities that once you go electronic, you raise revenue, essentially, from the fees, fines, and whatever.

708
01:24:34,318 --> 01:24:37,339
[SPEAKER_06]: And then just forecasting, just saying, where were we at this year?

709
01:24:37,819 --> 01:24:43,340
[SPEAKER_06]: If we raise a certain permit's cost, what will that give us next year?

710
01:24:43,980 --> 01:24:45,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, very difficult if you don't know where you're starting from.

711
01:24:47,032 --> 01:24:58,942
[SPEAKER_06]: And barriers or hurdles to getting there are certainly costs, you know, we're going through next this year, probably next year, a little bit of a fiscal challenge, you know, that's difficult because you got to have money to start it.

712
01:25:00,513 --> 01:25:04,175
[SPEAKER_06]: What is the overall vision across the entire city of what we want to accomplish?

713
01:25:04,195 --> 01:25:05,415
[SPEAKER_06]: Does it include schools?

714
01:25:05,435 --> 01:25:07,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Does it include public safety?

715
01:25:07,696 --> 01:25:08,996
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to think about that.

716
01:25:09,196 --> 01:25:11,417
[SPEAKER_06]: How much, how big of a bite do you want to take at once?

717
01:25:11,957 --> 01:25:14,298
[SPEAKER_06]: And then certain products, who owns them?

718
01:25:14,418 --> 01:25:22,180
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, somebody at the end of the day, like Bob needs to be able to own, you know, financial system coming in, but does he have the time for that?

719
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:24,141
[SPEAKER_06]: So do you need to bring in consultants?

720
01:25:24,181 --> 01:25:25,001
[SPEAKER_06]: How does that work?

721
01:25:25,161 --> 01:25:26,822
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you have to think about these things there.

722
01:25:28,302 --> 01:25:31,425
[SPEAKER_06]: That, I believe, concludes my presentation.

723
01:25:31,705 --> 01:25:34,327
[SPEAKER_06]: So any questions, what have you, I'm available.

724
01:25:34,767 --> 01:25:35,208
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

725
01:25:36,028 --> 01:25:41,633
[SPEAKER_05]: You've been watching, you've been learning, you've been iterating, and I didn't have to ask my questions, so I appreciate it.

726
01:25:42,173 --> 01:25:42,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Leming.

727
01:25:45,055 --> 01:25:45,475
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

728
01:25:45,495 --> 01:25:46,416
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

729
01:25:48,325 --> 01:26:01,029
[SPEAKER_09]: How much would it cost, and do you think it would be feasible to get one of those phishing simulation programs?

730
01:26:01,069 --> 01:26:07,632
[SPEAKER_09]: So in my last job, we would periodically get phishing emails that were actually sent out by IT.

731
01:26:07,652 --> 01:26:09,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's called a penetration test.

732
01:26:09,913 --> 01:26:10,973
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of places do them.

733
01:26:13,170 --> 01:26:16,271
[SPEAKER_06]: The problem with them is that they desensitize users to them.

734
01:26:17,072 --> 01:26:24,316
[SPEAKER_06]: So they think an email that is actually a legit phishing attempt is the test, and they either ignore it or they click on it to be funny or what have you.

735
01:26:25,177 --> 01:26:26,477
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't have the best results.

736
01:26:27,638 --> 01:26:32,281
[SPEAKER_06]: Back in the day, what they were, they were based on your infrastructure, what they were trying to do.

737
01:26:32,361 --> 01:26:36,203
[SPEAKER_06]: And then because everything moved to social engineering, they try to do things like that.

738
01:26:36,783 --> 01:26:38,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, they're so simplistic that

739
01:26:39,984 --> 01:26:48,969
[SPEAKER_06]: It'd be like the mayor, I get a text from the mayor saying, can you go to Best Buy and buy me five gift cards because I'm in a meeting and I want to reward the people I'm in the meeting with.

740
01:26:49,029 --> 01:26:50,930
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, well, I know that's not legit.

741
01:26:51,211 --> 01:26:52,431
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty easy to get around that.

742
01:26:53,972 --> 01:26:58,495
[SPEAKER_06]: There just isn't a lot of utility from my point of view on those tests.

743
01:26:59,459 --> 01:27:05,281
[SPEAKER_09]: I get a lot of I get a lot of emails from Zach asking me if I have time for a for a quick task.

744
01:27:06,422 --> 01:27:08,002
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but those are legit emails.

745
01:27:10,063 --> 01:27:20,067
[SPEAKER_06]: But, but no, so I mean, so the ones we do do testing, we just tested a couple years ago, we did training, I believe in training, because the training runs you through the scenarios that you will see.

746
01:27:20,627 --> 01:27:25,776
[SPEAKER_06]: okay, versus a one-off getting an email that looks like these 17 other phishing emails you got, I prefer training.

747
01:27:26,257 --> 01:27:31,687
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you train users up, they become, that becomes moot at that point because they know it's a phishing expedition.

748
01:27:32,718 --> 01:27:48,887
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, well, the ones in my previous employer, the way it worked was if people actually did click on them or they, they didn't report them, then it would sort of mark those users being like less, um, able to work out that it was a phishing email of what you're supposed to do is just report it.

749
01:27:49,127 --> 01:27:51,588
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it becomes punitive and you send them back for more training.

750
01:27:51,608 --> 01:27:53,329
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just, I don't like the feel of that.

751
01:27:53,549 --> 01:27:53,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

752
01:27:54,110 --> 01:27:54,350
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

753
01:27:55,350 --> 01:27:55,611
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

754
01:27:55,931 --> 01:27:57,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thank you.

755
01:28:00,353 --> 01:28:00,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

756
01:28:01,214 --> 01:28:01,334
[SPEAKER_05]: Um,

757
01:28:03,609 --> 01:28:04,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Two questions for you.

758
01:28:04,891 --> 01:28:10,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see that there's a shift from data processing to communication applications.

759
01:28:10,440 --> 01:28:13,165
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm guessing that's just a better nomenclature.

760
01:28:13,425 --> 01:28:13,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, great.

761
01:28:14,807 --> 01:28:17,552
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess it's three questions.

762
01:28:19,694 --> 01:28:24,579
[SPEAKER_05]: The goal completion timelines on the projects that you brought up.

763
01:28:24,939 --> 01:28:29,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there many of them in the upcoming fiscal year or many of them out a few years, some span.

764
01:28:31,845 --> 01:28:36,850
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, next fiscal year after this so yeah I guess I'm still working on them and fiscal year 27 I probably

765
01:28:38,710 --> 01:28:42,413
[SPEAKER_06]: fail as an IT director or something really bad has happened to us budgetarily.

766
01:28:43,174 --> 01:28:49,959
[SPEAKER_06]: But yes, the goal is having on this next coming fiscal year sorry yeah fiscal 26 great last thing on the permitting project.

767
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:56,584
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that you know the clerk's office the planning office sounds like now Board of Health.

768
01:28:57,711 --> 01:29:00,292
[SPEAKER_05]: are working with the building department on the CitizenServe system.

769
01:29:00,432 --> 01:29:02,473
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm guessing you're involved in that?

770
01:29:02,793 --> 01:29:08,595
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not currently, and that's why I think it's one of those things that not one size fits all.

771
01:29:08,635 --> 01:29:11,496
[SPEAKER_06]: I know there's limitations to CitizenServe as far as other departments go.

772
01:29:11,516 --> 01:29:14,497
[SPEAKER_06]: It'd be great to have everything under one umbrella for sure.

773
01:29:14,517 --> 01:29:19,459
[SPEAKER_06]: I know CitizenServe has a pretty high cost to it.

774
01:29:20,359 --> 01:29:22,000
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not unsurmountable.

775
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:25,821
[SPEAKER_06]: What other communities have done is they figure out how many licenses they'll need.

776
01:29:26,301 --> 01:29:28,564
[SPEAKER_06]: because you have to every department, every user has to have a license.

777
01:29:29,325 --> 01:29:35,094
[SPEAKER_06]: And they will then reevaluate the cost of their permits and bake that cost into the cost of the permits.

778
01:29:35,134 --> 01:29:36,376
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's self funded, essentially.

779
01:29:36,596 --> 01:29:37,297
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

780
01:29:37,537 --> 01:29:38,539
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's a great way of doing it.

781
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:39,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

782
01:29:40,134 --> 01:29:47,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think that's something you know, we we need to circle back around as well as a council, we had a request out for departments around their fee schedules.

783
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:50,702
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, permits is a good time to really look at that.

784
01:29:50,722 --> 01:29:51,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

785
01:29:51,482 --> 01:29:51,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

786
01:29:52,563 --> 01:29:52,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

787
01:29:53,504 --> 01:29:54,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's all I had.

788
01:29:54,545 --> 01:29:56,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have anything else from the council?

789
01:29:57,407 --> 01:30:01,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing none, you're always allowed to email me and remind me that I offered you to go first.

790
01:30:02,170 --> 01:30:03,391
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

791
01:30:08,303 --> 01:30:11,104
[SPEAKER_05]: We will go now to executive.

792
01:30:30,210 --> 01:30:34,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Or actually elections is technically alphabetically first, so we'll do elections if that's all right with you, Nina.

793
01:30:35,080 --> 01:30:35,300
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

794
01:30:35,380 --> 01:30:36,401
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever the council would like.

795
01:30:36,421 --> 01:30:37,021
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.

796
01:30:37,061 --> 01:30:37,561
[SPEAKER_00]: President Bears.

797
01:30:38,862 --> 01:30:39,062
[SPEAKER_00]: Um.

798
01:30:39,982 --> 01:30:43,123
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy to be here before you all and happy to present these budgets.

799
01:30:43,964 --> 01:30:49,026
[SPEAKER_00]: Um as far as elections is concerned, I don't think we've had an opportunity to update the council.

800
01:30:49,626 --> 01:30:54,408
[SPEAKER_00]: We are happy to report that there is an elections manager coming on this month.

801
01:30:55,168 --> 01:30:55,608
[SPEAKER_00]: So to be

802
01:31:04,492 --> 01:31:05,154
[SPEAKER_00]: mission critical.

803
01:31:05,194 --> 01:31:06,477
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a municipal election.

804
01:31:08,041 --> 01:31:10,246
[SPEAKER_00]: We need somebody to run that election.

805
01:31:10,326 --> 01:31:11,930
[SPEAKER_00]: So that said,

806
01:31:16,552 --> 01:31:25,474
[SPEAKER_00]: like the law department budget, we're not going to put a department head in a position where they're coming on and then immediately expected to present a budget that they might not have even formulated.

807
01:31:25,894 --> 01:31:38,838
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm here and I can tell you, I can tell the council that the former elections manager, Danielle Petrantonio, who as you know, took a position with another community that was a good opportunity for her.

808
01:31:39,418 --> 01:31:45,605
[SPEAKER_00]: and her family had put this budget together, and it was reviewed by myself and the mayor.

809
01:31:49,208 --> 01:32:01,574
[SPEAKER_00]: effectively, you know, the parts and pieces that were put in here were the parts and pieces that were presented by Miss Petrantonio with one minor element that pertained to seasonal salaries.

810
01:32:02,694 --> 01:32:07,517
[SPEAKER_00]: Frankly, I believe that we need to manage and monitor those hours.

811
01:32:07,797 --> 01:32:13,580
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there is a justification for additional hours and there's a need, you know, we can present that to the council at a later time.

812
01:32:13,660 --> 01:32:16,041
[SPEAKER_00]: But I believe that we can

813
01:32:17,653 --> 01:32:30,082
[SPEAKER_00]: we should be able to manage that work within the same amount of resources that we managed this past years, perhaps I would argue, and I'm probably not the expert to argue this, right?

814
01:32:30,182 --> 01:32:37,308
[SPEAKER_00]: But more complicated elections this past year versus the ones that we have in this year.

815
01:32:38,889 --> 01:32:44,233
[SPEAKER_00]: The major difference in this year's proposed elections budget and last year is,

816
01:32:45,974 --> 01:33:03,622
[SPEAKER_00]: Outside of the fixed cost growth, which are items that have been identified by the former elections managers, items that are just naturally increasing, there is the added cost of printing ballots, which we are responsible to do since it's a municipal election versus getting the ballots delivered to the city from the state.

817
01:33:05,105 --> 01:33:07,789
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I don't really have any other further comments.

818
01:33:07,929 --> 01:33:19,925
[SPEAKER_00]: I am, I will note, I am checking some of the wages because something looks a little off, but in terms of being a little low, but what I'm seeing in front of me is that it's correct.

819
01:33:19,986 --> 01:33:21,568
[SPEAKER_00]: I just need to dive a little bit deeper.

820
01:33:22,008 --> 01:33:25,892
[SPEAKER_00]: because I'm not seeing, for instance, a 2% on one of the positions.

821
01:33:26,392 --> 01:33:29,755
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe the elections manager increase is correct.

822
01:33:29,795 --> 01:33:41,325
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a matter of previously budgeted versus hired and experience in that realm, as well as the part-time position I believe is correct.

823
01:33:41,385 --> 01:33:46,029
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's a matter of budgeted last year versus actual this year, which is, I think those two are correct.

824
01:33:46,129 --> 01:33:48,912
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just looking at the other position at head clerk just to make sure that's accurate.

825
01:33:49,492 --> 01:33:53,055
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's an error in there, we'd make a minor adjustment before the final budget is submitted.

826
01:33:54,195 --> 01:33:54,416
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.

827
01:33:55,957 --> 01:33:56,537
[SPEAKER_05]: That's great.

828
01:33:56,657 --> 01:33:59,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we can go to law next and then we can circle back to executive.

829
01:34:02,281 --> 01:34:11,908
[SPEAKER_05]: You know my three questions and you basically answered them for elections, but for law, you know, I would say we do have a bit more or doesn't have questions on elections.

830
01:34:11,948 --> 01:34:12,568
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, guys.

831
01:34:16,150 --> 01:34:17,151
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not not in the budget.

832
01:34:17,251 --> 01:34:18,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, well, this is still

833
01:34:19,894 --> 01:34:20,534
[SPEAKER_05]: You can still ask.

834
01:34:25,156 --> 01:34:25,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, you can.

835
01:34:26,656 --> 01:34:28,617
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he's contemplating whether I'm the right person.

836
01:34:28,757 --> 01:34:29,757
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be my guess, but.

837
01:34:30,417 --> 01:34:41,941
[SPEAKER_09]: No, well, are we going to, we're going to, when the new elections person is brought, the new elections manager is brought on, they're going to come before city council and we can talk to them, right?

838
01:34:42,660 --> 01:34:43,601
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I mean, absolutely.

839
01:34:43,641 --> 01:34:52,106
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the council has made a regular request to meet new department heads.

840
01:34:52,366 --> 01:34:55,208
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would work to get that scheduled in.

841
01:34:55,468 --> 01:35:00,131
[SPEAKER_00]: And we like to give the department head some time to get their feet on the ground.

842
01:35:00,491 --> 01:35:03,553
[SPEAKER_00]: But beyond that, we'll happily work together on that.

843
01:35:03,873 --> 01:35:05,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'll save my questions for then.

844
01:35:05,515 --> 01:35:05,855
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

845
01:35:05,935 --> 01:35:06,035
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

846
01:35:07,633 --> 01:35:12,414
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, we can move on to the law department.

847
01:35:12,555 --> 01:35:17,136
[SPEAKER_05]: So we do have here some changes.

848
01:35:19,036 --> 01:35:21,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a huge change, actually a reduction of $5,000.

849
01:35:22,197 --> 01:35:31,080
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, if you do have any highlights, or you wanna talk about the great work that Janice Spencer has been doing,

850
01:35:33,035 --> 01:35:35,697
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, you know, but I do think we're going to have some questions here.

851
01:35:36,518 --> 01:35:39,861
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a solicitor who's been hired and that's the first permanent solicitor in several years.

852
01:35:39,881 --> 01:35:46,347
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's pretty significant change for the office and I would guess for the operations of how the law department and legal integrates with the city.

853
01:35:46,467 --> 01:35:49,630
[SPEAKER_05]: But other than that, I'll turn it over to you and then we can go to questions.

854
01:35:50,692 --> 01:35:51,413
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, President Bears.

855
01:35:51,914 --> 01:36:00,022
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent question and excellent opportunity to highlight how much Janice Spencer has done over the past.

856
01:36:00,802 --> 01:36:08,490
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's maybe over two years, like you said, at this point, holding together the work that goes on in that office.

857
01:36:08,610 --> 01:36:11,133
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, it may seem like there's

858
01:36:14,291 --> 01:36:22,154
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps not a lot going on but there's a tremendous amount of public records request that Janice has single handedly, you know, managed.

859
01:36:23,154 --> 01:36:30,137
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, legal has helped through KP law in terms of the legal element of those responses but Janice has.

860
01:36:31,337 --> 01:36:39,026
[SPEAKER_00]: undoubtedly taken the lion's share of that workload and done an excellent job and very, very professional job executing that work.

861
01:36:39,086 --> 01:36:41,168
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's been challenging.

862
01:36:41,388 --> 01:36:49,217
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it hasn't been without a drain, but she has handled it excellently and I think

863
01:36:49,817 --> 01:36:57,661
[SPEAKER_00]: the city is definitely in deep gratitude to her and her work and her patience and her professionalism because it's evident day in and day out.

864
01:36:57,721 --> 01:37:08,547
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, our current city solicitor has made it known to me that he sees that in Janice and her professionalism shines above and beyond and she really is.

865
01:37:10,224 --> 01:37:12,064
[SPEAKER_00]: just excellent at her work.

866
01:37:12,424 --> 01:37:19,166
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're excited that there will be a partnership between Janice and the new city solicitor, Kevin Foley.

867
01:37:20,986 --> 01:37:33,988
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also very excited that we'll be able to integrate a different operational approach to how we do business and what we'll be able to do with an inside council, which we probably haven't had the opportunity to do.

868
01:37:34,588 --> 01:37:38,409
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said before this body, and I'll say again,

869
01:37:40,404 --> 01:37:45,552
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps this is my editorial comment, but I would characterize it and I.

870
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:49,721
[SPEAKER_00]: and I. Feel incredibly strongly about this.

871
01:37:50,181 --> 01:37:58,406
[SPEAKER_00]: We hired when we had a qualified and appropriate city solicitor, so I candidate so I am excited.

872
01:37:58,426 --> 01:37:58,867
[SPEAKER_00]: I am.

873
01:37:59,167 --> 01:38:00,528
[SPEAKER_00]: I am looking forward to, um.

874
01:38:02,509 --> 01:38:08,292
[SPEAKER_00]: This council, the city these departments to see what we can, you know, collectively do.

875
01:38:08,472 --> 01:38:10,033
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take some time because we have to

876
01:38:17,898 --> 01:38:24,640
[SPEAKER_00]: basically a level funded budget for the retainer that the city pays KP Law.

877
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:40,905
[SPEAKER_00]: KP Law was proposing to increase their retainer, but with some various conversations with KP Law, including our new city solicitor even before he started work, we came to an understanding with KP Law that, you know,

878
01:38:41,425 --> 01:38:45,286
[SPEAKER_00]: it wouldn't be appropriate to increase the retainer at this stage.

879
01:38:45,326 --> 01:38:50,048
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be only appropriate to manage within the existing retainer footprint.

880
01:38:50,108 --> 01:39:03,972
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand costs go up and hourly wages do go up and rates and everything is increasing, but we were able to work with KP Law to manage that retainer as a level amount effectively.

881
01:39:03,992 --> 01:39:04,052
[SPEAKER_00]: And

882
01:39:06,450 --> 01:39:08,932
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we'll be evaluating that throughout the year.

883
01:39:09,372 --> 01:39:20,461
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, you know, the budget is level funded and, you know, the only minor differences are, you know, actual budgeted and actual actual costs for FY 26.

884
01:39:20,521 --> 01:39:27,547
[SPEAKER_00]: Chancellor Lazzaro.

885
01:39:29,177 --> 01:39:29,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.

886
01:39:31,578 --> 01:39:36,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Has the new solicitor, city solicitor started?

887
01:39:36,101 --> 01:39:38,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

888
01:39:39,203 --> 01:39:47,468
[SPEAKER_03]: So I worked for the superintendent when we had the former city solicitor and he would

889
01:39:48,785 --> 01:39:53,909
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember he would periodically come to school committee meetings, so, or frequently.

890
01:39:55,050 --> 01:40:03,997
[SPEAKER_03]: So I am curious about how, because I was, you know, I was taking the minutes, but I wasn't an active, you know, elected at the time.

891
01:40:05,338 --> 01:40:15,786
[SPEAKER_03]: What will be, first of all, when can we, just in the same vein as meeting other department heads, when can we start,

892
01:40:17,713 --> 01:40:24,660
[SPEAKER_03]: introducing ourselves, or should we shift our behaviors?

893
01:40:25,040 --> 01:40:27,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Or will it be a little bit more of a fluid?

894
01:40:27,642 --> 01:40:30,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, this is a lot of questions all at once.

895
01:40:31,006 --> 01:40:32,447
[SPEAKER_03]: An easier

896
01:40:35,082 --> 01:40:48,124
[SPEAKER_03]: the process of us reaching out and getting legal opinions on things that we're working on, or things that we're curious about, or any of that stuff.

897
01:40:48,144 --> 01:40:49,785
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very excited about the prospect.

898
01:40:49,845 --> 01:40:54,445
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really a great thing for the whole city, I think.

899
01:40:54,525 --> 01:40:58,366
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm glad to be moving forward in this direction, just excited to hear more about it.

900
01:40:59,626 --> 01:40:59,926
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

901
01:40:59,946 --> 01:41:00,786
[SPEAKER_00]: President Bears, through you.

902
01:41:01,507 --> 01:41:01,707
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

903
01:41:01,727 --> 01:41:02,167
[SPEAKER_00]: So

904
01:41:04,736 --> 01:41:10,667
[SPEAKER_00]: Kevin Foley began yesterday, yesterday was his first day and and you know I've I.

905
01:41:14,445 --> 01:41:17,226
[SPEAKER_00]: have had a number of different conversations and meetings with him.

906
01:41:17,666 --> 01:41:28,148
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take some time to, you know, his wheels were turning before he began work in terms of the type of work that he could potentially take on.

907
01:41:28,728 --> 01:41:40,351
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the days, I know that the city had outside legal counsel when the city had, you know, former city solicitors on board.

908
01:41:40,991 --> 01:41:44,012
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, but I think from what I could tell,

909
01:41:44,713 --> 01:41:45,895
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wasn't here at the time.

910
01:41:46,636 --> 01:41:57,555
[SPEAKER_00]: Members of the council who were here at the time and and members, maybe former members of the council and obviously the mayor would probably have a better understanding but my general understanding is

911
01:41:59,735 --> 01:42:01,796
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just so much more going on now.

912
01:42:02,276 --> 01:42:15,139
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think those days of having one city solicitor or two city solicitors and limited outside counsel is really a past matter.

913
01:42:16,039 --> 01:42:29,122
[SPEAKER_00]: I did send our city solicitor some information in preparation for his first week, so to speak, on how many different things we have going on.

914
01:42:29,883 --> 01:42:44,518
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, I'm not really the person to say this, this really will be something that Kevin will be able to digest and analyze and be able to speak to once he has his feet on the ground, you know, a couple months down the road, perhaps.

915
01:42:45,518 --> 01:42:51,099
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just don't believe it's really humanly possible for that workload to fall on one person's shoulders.

916
01:42:51,600 --> 01:43:07,763
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting back to your question, Councilor Lazzaro, I think it's a matter of allowing Solicitor Foley to analyze the work, get caught up to speed on what the work is, and then, you know, dive in.

917
01:43:07,823 --> 01:43:14,365
[SPEAKER_00]: We have asked department heads to continue their communications with whichever council they're working with,

918
01:43:15,025 --> 01:43:22,190
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to integrate a somewhat seamless operation of a transition.

919
01:43:22,631 --> 01:43:29,396
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's going to require Solicitor Foley having an opportunity to really get his arms around what's in front of him.

920
01:43:29,476 --> 01:43:41,184
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as an example, on just the retainer in nature of the work that is done by KP Law is things along the lines of general

921
01:43:42,525 --> 01:43:54,790
[SPEAKER_00]: labor services, general legal services, procurement matters, gun appeal, gun hearings and I think effectively appeals, but I'm not, I don't really get involved in those.

922
01:43:58,188 --> 01:44:03,532
[SPEAKER_00]: community development board questions, ZBA questions, that is just the retainer.

923
01:44:03,592 --> 01:44:26,727
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the categories in the retainer, there's real estate as well in the retainer, there's, I feel like there's one or two categories that I'm missing in the retainer, public records requests, but there's a lot of work that happens in just basically the retainer, nevermind scenarios where we have litigation before boards or whether it's the CD board or the zoning board, those are all separate matters in and of themselves.

924
01:44:27,527 --> 01:44:36,550
[SPEAKER_00]: We are a self insured largely community which I understand is reasonably standard for communities the size of Medford and larger.

925
01:44:37,290 --> 01:44:47,953
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do have claims that have to get managed and and you know processed and those are also handled so each and every one of these becomes kind of a separate matter and depending upon the

926
01:44:49,772 --> 01:44:56,874
[SPEAKER_00]: the work that's before the law department, it just really needs to be managed and prioritized and triaged.

927
01:44:57,174 --> 01:45:14,979
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it comes to a matter of what Solicitor Foley feels he can manage, where he has, I think, when the council meets with Solicitor Foley, I'm sure he will describe his history and his experience.

928
01:45:15,480 --> 01:45:18,767
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the areas that he likes to, I won't try to.

929
01:45:22,661 --> 01:45:26,883
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, steal his thunder, so to speak, but he likes to say he's a expert in unemployment.

930
01:45:26,943 --> 01:45:38,208
[SPEAKER_00]: So naturally we're going to want to, and he's going to want to dive into unemployment issues for the city, you know, claims that is, and work to assist the city with those areas.

931
01:45:39,588 --> 01:45:46,531
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a high level response to saying, you know, it's gonna take a little bit of time before we have a real answer for that.

932
01:45:47,372 --> 01:45:49,253
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, you know, I wouldn't even say he's,

933
01:45:50,373 --> 01:45:52,274
[SPEAKER_00]: had the opportunity to scratch the surface at this point.

934
01:45:52,835 --> 01:45:57,677
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as the council members introducing themselves, I don't think there's any harm in saying hello.

935
01:46:01,360 --> 01:46:01,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

936
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:02,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for the answer.

937
01:46:03,721 --> 01:46:05,142
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think, you know, it would be

938
01:46:06,792 --> 01:46:20,095
[SPEAKER_05]: behoove us to in a couple weeks, two weeks, maybe sit down, I just want to talk through if we're going to change any protocols, if there's things that are going for requests that are going through me to you to KP right now that are going to go through him, and I understand he needs time to sit down.

939
01:46:21,816 --> 01:46:24,617
[SPEAKER_05]: And then also agreed on the workload.

940
01:46:24,677 --> 01:46:28,878
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, we have so much going on legislatively.

941
01:46:29,598 --> 01:46:32,199
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know there's all the work that goes on beyond that.

942
01:46:32,859 --> 01:46:33,239
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're in a

943
01:46:34,544 --> 01:46:36,165
[SPEAKER_05]: strange legal world right now.

944
01:46:38,365 --> 01:46:59,953
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but I think it would be, you know, good to talk about what it looks like to have counsel at meetings and visit, you know, just if there's going to be changes to protocol, ideally to, you know, I would hope you would think save you some time, save the mayor some time, now that we have in-house, an in-house director for the law department.

945
01:47:01,448 --> 01:47:14,273
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we have any other questions before I ask any of my own cancer saying, I know that years ago, um, this council fought pretty hard to get a get an assistant city solicitor added to the budget.

946
01:47:16,702 --> 01:47:25,149
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's very understandable that the priority was to hire a city solicitor and then see where we go from there on.

947
01:47:25,730 --> 01:47:36,939
[SPEAKER_07]: I think last year when that was taken out of the budget, our council made it kind of clear that we would like to see that position still be a priority in some way.

948
01:47:38,780 --> 01:47:42,243
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think at the time it was suggested that maybe we would see it in this budget.

949
01:47:43,104 --> 01:47:43,925
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was wondering,

950
01:47:44,772 --> 01:47:47,054
[SPEAKER_07]: if you have any updates with regards to that.

951
01:47:48,494 --> 01:47:49,115
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, President.

952
01:47:49,675 --> 01:47:52,457
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

953
01:47:52,497 --> 01:47:54,158
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say, through you, President Fairfax.

954
01:47:54,178 --> 01:47:56,039
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, I'll just cut to the chase.

955
01:48:01,023 --> 01:48:06,806
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a number of different things that flow through my mind, Councilor Tseng, with that question.

956
01:48:06,826 --> 01:48:11,509
[SPEAKER_00]: I recall the history in the same way you recall the history.

957
01:48:13,158 --> 01:48:23,188
[SPEAKER_00]: I think some of the factors that we can't entirely foresee is cost escalations and demands and draws on the budget.

958
01:48:24,289 --> 01:48:31,076
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the council knows that we've experienced a number of challenging financial years and

959
01:48:32,248 --> 01:48:41,276
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one way to look at the challenges we've had in the past is to say, our past challenges have been greater than our current challenge.

960
01:48:41,876 --> 01:48:42,717
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is huge.

961
01:48:45,943 --> 01:49:02,096
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I'm proud of, I think that this entire city should be proud of it's part of the teamwork that the mayor and this council have has established in in managing that issue and not letting it get out of hand because there were so many unforeseen without getting into, you know, all the challenges and how the

962
01:49:03,096 --> 01:49:10,680
[SPEAKER_00]: the budget structural deficits presented themselves in the past, although if any council member would like me to cover that, I'm happy to.

963
01:49:10,700 --> 01:49:17,264
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of respect to your time and your knowledge of the history, I won't dive into that now.

964
01:49:20,362 --> 01:49:23,523
[SPEAKER_00]: But realistically, we still are in a challenging financial situation.

965
01:49:24,363 --> 01:49:33,686
[SPEAKER_00]: And candidly, at some point in this budget season, I had messaged the mayor and said, I just was hoping that there was going to be one that wasn't going to be this challenging.

966
01:49:33,706 --> 01:49:36,447
[SPEAKER_00]: We know FY27 is going to be challenging.

967
01:49:36,607 --> 01:49:42,469
[SPEAKER_00]: We know we need to take on some debt to do a major and important project.

968
01:49:42,909 --> 01:49:46,330
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was kind of falsely hoping that there was going to be one.

969
01:49:46,990 --> 01:49:52,951
[SPEAKER_00]: And candidly, I was disappointed that we were in a situation where we were still dealing with a deficit.

970
01:49:54,552 --> 01:50:07,755
[SPEAKER_00]: So while I do my best to look at things in a positive way, and I am happy to say, at one point, we were offsetting the city's budget with $13 some odd million in ARPA funds.

971
01:50:07,855 --> 01:50:09,795
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you'd recall that, Councilor Tseng.

972
01:50:10,215 --> 01:50:16,179
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not anywhere in that world because we worked hard collectively to manage that.

973
01:50:16,879 --> 01:50:23,823
[SPEAKER_00]: But we still have some management work to do, and it all does come down to we can't fund everything we want to fund.

974
01:50:25,004 --> 01:50:34,089
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working hard to try to integrate department requests, council priorities in a very tight situation that we're in presently.

975
01:50:36,728 --> 01:50:48,514
[SPEAKER_00]: We've said in past, at least last year, I think last year might have been the first year we didn't offset the operating budget with one time funds effectively.

976
01:50:49,394 --> 01:50:52,796
[SPEAKER_00]: If my memory serves me correctly, we said we're not going back there.

977
01:50:53,457 --> 01:50:57,579
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's not how we should be doing business and that's not going to get us where we need to be.

978
01:50:57,659 --> 01:50:59,860
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a long way of saying,

979
01:51:03,036 --> 01:51:09,280
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that we have the flexibility, but it's really not something that's, frankly, my call.

980
01:51:10,581 --> 01:51:23,730
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know the requests that have been made that are in front of us are the ones we're analyzing, we're looking at, we're trying to include wherever possible, and we're not gonna be able to include them all.

981
01:51:24,370 --> 01:51:28,313
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be added on top of those, and I just don't know how it's possible, unfortunately.

982
01:51:33,637 --> 01:51:35,398
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm grateful for your explanation.

983
01:51:35,858 --> 01:51:45,943
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this is a conversation that we'll continue to have over the next few weeks, months, years to come.

984
01:51:46,703 --> 01:51:54,847
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad you referenced the history too, and I think I'm glad we remember it the same way.

985
01:51:56,327 --> 01:52:00,969
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think just to put out to folks who are maybe watching this meeting who,

986
01:52:03,256 --> 01:52:05,238
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, don't know that history a little bit.

987
01:52:05,538 --> 01:52:21,829
[SPEAKER_07]: I just, I think a lot of what the council was thinking back then when we fought so hard for it was just the idea that first, if we can bring more positions in-house in general, we would spend less money going forward with contracts, outside contracts.

988
01:52:22,950 --> 01:52:30,636
[SPEAKER_07]: And then a second kind of priority of making sure that we have as few conflicts of interest, especially when the city council needs legal help.

989
01:52:31,216 --> 01:52:31,596
[SPEAKER_07]: as well.

990
01:52:32,297 --> 01:52:50,928
[SPEAKER_07]: So those are just, you know, two of the things going through my mind for why this is an important thing for the City Council, but I also understand the needs of the budget and the kind of the other things that we could slash should be spending on.

991
01:52:51,268 --> 01:52:54,890
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think this is a, you know, something for this Council to discuss.

992
01:52:56,095 --> 01:53:03,258
[SPEAKER_07]: and figure out, and also for us to have continuing discourse and dialogue with your office about this.

993
01:53:04,379 --> 01:53:04,639
Thanks.

994
01:53:06,099 --> 01:53:06,540
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

995
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:10,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and I think I do have one specific question.

996
01:53:10,501 --> 01:53:17,965
[SPEAKER_05]: But just before we go there, I think we are sharing the same principle here.

997
01:53:17,985 --> 01:53:20,826
[SPEAKER_05]: And you said it in slightly different words than I would say it.

998
01:53:20,846 --> 01:53:24,408
[SPEAKER_05]: But we aren't able to fund everything we want or need to fund.

999
01:53:26,116 --> 01:53:36,684
[SPEAKER_05]: we don't have the revenue to fulfill the expenses, just fixed cost growth expenses that we have now, nevermind the things that we aren't doing that we know we need to do.

1000
01:53:38,626 --> 01:53:44,390
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, the override has helped, especially, I think, on the school side with that.

1001
01:53:44,810 --> 01:53:54,938
[SPEAKER_05]: But even then, right, we, it's a $7 million override, and it certainly helped DPW, we have a little bit more, like that's one relatively significant new investment that we were able to make on the city side.

1002
01:53:55,839 --> 01:54:02,598
[SPEAKER_05]: 500,000 being significant in this context, but maybe not in the greater context of what we need.

1003
01:54:05,479 --> 01:54:14,421
[SPEAKER_05]: But even then, the $7 million for the schools, $1.75 million of that was just not cuts happening last year that we covered with ARPA funds, right?

1004
01:54:14,441 --> 01:54:16,641
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's $5.25 million, and it's done a lot.

1005
01:54:19,081 --> 01:54:29,943
[SPEAKER_05]: But the costs are just escalating so much faster than the revenues, and especially these major drivers with health insurance, the trash contract.

1006
01:54:30,544 --> 01:54:31,464
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was a reality.

1007
01:54:34,026 --> 01:54:41,961
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, it was a reality that was getting better before November or January depending on the date that you want to pick and now it's a reality that's getting worse.

1008
01:54:45,128 --> 01:54:59,612
[SPEAKER_05]: it's a really frustrating situation when I like to try to see the budget in an inflation adjusted terms, because I think that's really the best way to understand what are we doing now versus what are we doing before.

1009
01:55:00,652 --> 01:55:05,274
[SPEAKER_05]: And after the recession in 2008, the real value of the city budget went down.

1010
01:55:05,674 --> 01:55:08,475
[SPEAKER_05]: It was worth, we had a budget that was 10 to 12% less

1011
01:55:10,385 --> 01:55:14,188
[SPEAKER_05]: in inflation adjusted terms than it was in 2006 and 2014 or 2015.

1012
01:55:15,209 --> 01:55:18,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Slowly under Mary Burke, that started going up.

1013
01:55:19,032 --> 01:55:23,415
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, you know, there was this kind of COVID shock.

1014
01:55:24,656 --> 01:55:26,498
[SPEAKER_05]: But we actually started doing better a little bit.

1015
01:55:26,618 --> 01:55:28,899
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there was this huge supply shock from inflation.

1016
01:55:28,979 --> 01:55:33,243
[SPEAKER_05]: And by fiscal 23, we were back down, you know, we'd gotten up to like 5% above fiscal 2006 value by like fiscal 2021.

1017
01:55:36,917 --> 01:55:40,199
[SPEAKER_05]: back down to zero immediately in 23.

1018
01:55:41,320 --> 01:55:43,522
[SPEAKER_05]: And with the overrides, we only are back on trend.

1019
01:55:44,162 --> 01:55:44,423
[SPEAKER_05]: We're at 9%.

1020
01:55:44,543 --> 01:55:56,071
[SPEAKER_05]: We're like the budget can do 9% more now than it did in fiscal 2006, which averages out to like 0.45% per year.

1021
01:55:57,412 --> 01:55:59,574
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's really, and that's with new growth.

1022
01:55:59,634 --> 01:56:03,016
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's, you know, so it's a hugely,

1023
01:56:04,492 --> 01:56:10,434
[SPEAKER_05]: We're in a really difficult fiscal environment, and we all have priorities.

1024
01:56:10,594 --> 01:56:11,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Assistant City Solicitor is a priority.

1025
01:56:11,914 --> 01:56:22,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Assistant City Solicitor just dedicated to the Council to help us work through the significant legislation that we have been working on for several years now would be of huge value.

1026
01:56:22,757 --> 01:56:29,799
[SPEAKER_05]: But we also heard from Rich Lane that he could have a department of six more people, and Paul Riggi that he could have a department for four more people.

1027
01:56:29,899 --> 01:56:32,280
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's just the people we heard from tonight.

1028
01:56:32,320 --> 01:56:32,780
[SPEAKER_05]: We heard that

1029
01:56:33,459 --> 01:56:35,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Mary Ann, you know, we heard it from Mary Ann as well, right?

1030
01:56:35,921 --> 01:56:42,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Like they have four or five people, maybe even more than that, who could be at risk from state and federal and private grant issues.

1031
01:56:44,848 --> 01:56:49,732
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have, you know, again, we're in this position where we have dozens and dozens of positions.

1032
01:56:51,053 --> 01:57:00,041
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we brought Barbara Cameron in here, she'd say, well, the Somerville Planning Department is 80 people and ours is I think 12 now maybe, or maybe even less than that.

1033
01:57:02,486 --> 01:57:06,268
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have, and those are just the needs on the operating budget.

1034
01:57:06,709 --> 01:57:11,772
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't touched as much that we need to build a new high school and we need to keep our buildings in place.

1035
01:57:11,852 --> 01:57:21,537
[SPEAKER_05]: So it just is a really difficult fiscal situation and I'm never going to not say it when it arises and it is important for us to talk about.

1036
01:57:21,557 --> 01:57:28,181
[SPEAKER_05]: I do have one question, which is I did notice in our difficult fiscal situation that the solicitor salary dropped a little bit.

1037
01:57:28,361 --> 01:57:31,003
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was just wondering if that was just because it was kind of a,

1038
01:57:32,055 --> 01:57:34,760
[SPEAKER_05]: hypothetical salary versus real salary?

1039
01:57:34,880 --> 01:57:35,661
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly right, yeah.

1040
01:57:36,042 --> 01:57:36,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1041
01:57:37,164 --> 01:57:39,107
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, President Bears, if I may, I think

1042
01:57:40,332 --> 01:57:51,795
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the context is important, and I think this council makes it a point to inform the residents and those who are hopefully watching these meetings to have that context.

1043
01:57:51,855 --> 01:58:02,758
[SPEAKER_00]: I also know that this council often has to address statements that are perhaps misleading, whether intentional or unintentional.

1044
01:58:04,553 --> 01:58:08,575
[SPEAKER_00]: And I appreciate the work that goes into that, because it's important.

1045
01:58:09,015 --> 01:58:10,816
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much history here, right?

1046
01:58:10,836 --> 01:58:18,279
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so much that goes into why we're where we are.

1047
01:58:18,819 --> 01:58:25,663
[SPEAKER_00]: And you touched on a large part of that, probably beyond my knowledge, in terms of going back to the real,

1048
01:58:28,222 --> 01:58:34,178
[SPEAKER_00]: monetary value of the dollar or the budget going back to as you cited, you know, 2008.

1049
01:58:36,090 --> 01:58:49,918
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that it's also important and perhaps I was remiss in saying, we were in the deficits and I know the council knows this, but just for context for the public, we were in deficits because of the challenges that the pandemic presented.

1050
01:58:49,938 --> 01:58:54,140
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really love going back to those days because I don't think really anyone wants to hear it.

1051
01:58:54,540 --> 01:59:02,305
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is really for the public again, but there was so much uncertainty and every city and town was building in such

1052
01:59:03,805 --> 01:59:06,026
[SPEAKER_00]: reduction in estimated revenues.

1053
01:59:06,466 --> 01:59:07,746
[SPEAKER_00]: This city did no different.

1054
01:59:08,886 --> 01:59:18,128
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result, it turned out that the amount of revenue we collected was greater than what we expected to collect.

1055
01:59:18,208 --> 01:59:20,348
[SPEAKER_00]: But these things are natural.

1056
01:59:20,808 --> 01:59:24,269
[SPEAKER_00]: It is our fiduciary responsibility to conservatively budget.

1057
01:59:24,709 --> 01:59:29,450
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I know that comes up often, and I think the main point of my last comment is to say,

1058
01:59:30,351 --> 01:59:48,832
[SPEAKER_00]: I often hear that there's discussion that occurs at this council by members of the public in terms of, you know, free cash and what free cash is and, you know, the talking point that I hear often is that free cash is overtaxed dollars but the reality of the situation is the city cannot.

1059
01:59:50,053 --> 01:59:55,760
[SPEAKER_00]: estimate revenues above what it will get in revenues because it will have a structural deficit.

1060
01:59:55,820 --> 02:00:06,412
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I know this council knows this, but for anyone in the public who's following these meetings and who's listening and who hears potentially these comments about

1061
02:00:06,952 --> 02:00:09,576
[SPEAKER_00]: how you know free cash is overtaxed dollars.

1062
02:00:09,977 --> 02:00:20,371
[SPEAKER_00]: First and foremost, a lot of our free cash was a result of the ARPA that was generated and you've said that President Bears and past meetings, seems that no matter how many times it stated, sometimes falls on deaf ears.

1063
02:00:23,094 --> 02:00:35,069
[SPEAKER_00]: following the leadership of the comments made by Councilor Tseng and you, President Bears, I feel it needs to be restated by others as well.

1064
02:00:35,109 --> 02:00:40,756
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's important to be restated by me to the degree that that helps the public understand that

1065
02:00:41,777 --> 02:00:46,361
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't estimate revenues at the amount that they will come in.

1066
02:00:46,401 --> 02:00:47,562
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, we don't have a crystal ball.

1067
02:00:48,363 --> 02:00:57,710
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondly, we can't be in a situation where we don't collect enough revenue to manage the budget that we so we will always we should always have a surplus.

1068
02:00:57,970 --> 02:01:00,212
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not doing our jobs if we don't have a surplus.

1069
02:01:01,333 --> 02:01:13,483
[SPEAKER_00]: One step beyond that, and I swear this will be my last comment, is the Department of Revenue, Division of Local Services at the state level recommends that we have a share of money that comes in.

1070
02:01:13,924 --> 02:01:24,352
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, remember, again for the public, we're building off of a foundation where ARPA injected a lot of money into our free cash effectively, you know, indirectly.

1071
02:01:25,073 --> 02:01:25,193
[SPEAKER_00]: And

1072
02:01:26,182 --> 02:01:28,643
[SPEAKER_00]: that's built up over several years.

1073
02:01:29,304 --> 02:01:36,508
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on top of that, where the amount that's going into what is getting certified as free cash, those amounts are reasonable.

1074
02:01:37,568 --> 02:01:39,509
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll stop there and thank you for your indulgence.

1075
02:01:39,949 --> 02:01:41,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thank you, Madam Chief of Staff.

1076
02:01:41,610 --> 02:01:52,136
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think, you know, it's this difficult situation where we ask people, there is a lot of history, there is a lot of context, and we ask people to hold two truths simultaneously.

1077
02:01:52,336 --> 02:01:54,077
[SPEAKER_05]: And sometimes that can be hard.

1078
02:01:55,458 --> 02:01:55,638
[SPEAKER_05]: But

1079
02:01:56,588 --> 02:02:09,674
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, if ARPA never happened, then we'd basically be, we would have, we were lucky that the revenue came in higher than it did, because if ARPA never happened, then we wouldn't have accrued these balances.

1080
02:02:10,314 --> 02:02:17,757
[SPEAKER_05]: And these balances, while not insignificant, pay for one major capital project if we use it all on that, right?

1081
02:02:17,797 --> 02:02:19,698
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not that, you know, we,

1082
02:02:22,792 --> 02:02:25,973
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not that this money is meaningless, it's actually great.

1083
02:02:25,993 --> 02:02:30,033
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if ARPA didn't happen, we would be in an even worse situation.

1084
02:02:30,113 --> 02:02:33,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it happened, I did a spreadsheet where it's basically a 95%.

1085
02:02:35,094 --> 02:02:43,336
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if you look at the free cash balance and then the ARPA revenue replacement, it's basically 95% of the free cash balance came out of the ARPA revenue replacement, right?

1086
02:02:43,376 --> 02:02:43,856
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's great.

1087
02:02:43,896 --> 02:02:46,016
[SPEAKER_05]: That means that we have these funds to do these investments.

1088
02:02:46,676 --> 02:02:49,917
[SPEAKER_05]: If it hadn't happened, we'd have basically no free cash and we'd have tight budgets.

1089
02:02:51,996 --> 02:02:53,337
[SPEAKER_05]: And your point is well taken.

1090
02:02:53,397 --> 02:03:02,160
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, the more that I've spent time doing this, you know, understanding, we had no idea what was going to happen.

1091
02:03:02,180 --> 02:03:04,940
[SPEAKER_05]: So we underestimated revenue pretty significantly.

1092
02:03:06,741 --> 02:03:11,543
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, the public, the residents, the businesses,

1093
02:03:14,004 --> 02:03:24,969
[SPEAKER_05]: did better than we thought, right, like meals and rooms did better and excise tax did better and some of the things that put together local receipts did better than we expected and that's really good.

1094
02:03:25,249 --> 02:03:28,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Things were not as bad as we budgeted for.

1095
02:03:29,051 --> 02:03:36,675
[SPEAKER_05]: And between that and ARPA, we have a little bit of money to make some forward looking investments on some really urgent issues, but it's not that

1096
02:03:37,872 --> 02:03:43,935
[SPEAKER_05]: we have, you know, an ongoing persistent forever, you know, windfall, right?

1097
02:03:43,975 --> 02:03:45,496
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not that we're going to get that every year.

1098
02:03:45,576 --> 02:03:55,481
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's really interesting and especially right as we now see the tides turn the other direction with finances and with the way that the federal government is acting.

1099
02:03:56,982 --> 02:04:06,687
[SPEAKER_05]: We're kind of going to be on the other end of that where we're maybe going to get, you know, hopefully there's not a billion and a half dollar Medicaid cut that is then cutting public health or chapter 90 or whatever.

1100
02:04:07,470 --> 02:04:14,292
[SPEAKER_05]: or UGA or Chapter 70, you know, these things that are essential, local aid that comes from those environments.

1101
02:04:14,372 --> 02:04:19,613
[SPEAKER_05]: So we benefited from the fact that we were in an environment where the federal government said we need to invest in our communities.

1102
02:04:20,694 --> 02:04:22,474
[SPEAKER_05]: And without that, we would have been at a zero basis.

1103
02:04:22,534 --> 02:04:24,234
[SPEAKER_05]: And now we're in kind of an opposite position.

1104
02:04:25,095 --> 02:04:30,516
[SPEAKER_05]: And so those winds of federal policy are very strong.

1105
02:04:31,096 --> 02:04:33,017
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll go to Councilor Leming and then Councilor Scarpelli.

1106
02:04:36,236 --> 02:04:36,937
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1107
02:04:37,677 --> 02:04:59,292
[SPEAKER_09]: First, just one question and then a bit more comment, but besides the money that we received from the federal government, how much just on average free cash have we generated as a result of unspent money from the yearly operating budget year to year?

1108
02:05:02,658 --> 02:05:14,464
[SPEAKER_00]: President Bears, through you, I don't know that I have a number for that, because I think it's a little intertwined would be probably the best way I would be able to describe it.

1109
02:05:15,565 --> 02:05:18,846
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, if I've understood your question correctly.

1110
02:05:19,086 --> 02:05:23,268
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, what I mean by the question, and it's just a percentage.

1111
02:05:23,328 --> 02:05:25,089
[SPEAKER_09]: So the state recommends that it's between 3% to 5%.

1112
02:05:26,909 --> 02:05:27,850
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, every year.

1113
02:05:27,870 --> 02:05:33,172
[SPEAKER_09]: So I was just I just wanted to know if I didn't want to get into like a long discussion about it.

1114
02:05:33,192 --> 02:05:43,898
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you had it off the top of your head, like, I just want to know if there's sort of like an average number that the city has been putting into free cash as a result of unspent money from the operating budget every year.

1115
02:05:45,005 --> 02:05:56,873
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have those numbers and they're intertwined with the ARPA amounts because what we didn't spend in a budget over here because we had COVID funds, you know, has directly or indirectly affected that number.

1116
02:05:56,893 --> 02:05:58,514
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have that analysis.

1117
02:05:58,634 --> 02:05:58,874
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1118
02:05:59,074 --> 02:05:59,635
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1119
02:05:59,755 --> 02:06:00,155
[SPEAKER_09]: That's fine.

1120
02:06:00,515 --> 02:06:09,321
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just curious if you did, but you know, not everybody would necessarily have that off the top of your head, but to comment on a few points.

1121
02:06:09,401 --> 02:06:12,843
[SPEAKER_09]: So yes, taking two truths at one time is,

1122
02:06:15,054 --> 02:06:17,796
[SPEAKER_09]: is something that we ask people to do.

1123
02:06:17,816 --> 02:06:34,962
[SPEAKER_09]: I think saying that there's a million dollar deficit in a year when we successfully passed an override is understandable because we have been experiencing a very difficult economy.

1124
02:06:35,803 --> 02:06:43,586
[SPEAKER_09]: And the fact is that if the override had not passed, we would be in a far worse situation than otherwise.

1125
02:06:46,043 --> 02:06:50,364
[SPEAKER_09]: people continue to conflate the free cash with operating budgets.

1126
02:06:51,684 --> 02:06:57,366
[SPEAKER_09]: The fact of the matter is that it is bad practice to use free cash to pay for salaries.

1127
02:06:57,786 --> 02:06:59,926
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not something the state recommends doing.

1128
02:07:00,406 --> 02:07:04,787
[SPEAKER_09]: That affects our ability to get, that affects our bond ratings.

1129
02:07:04,907 --> 02:07:06,787
[SPEAKER_09]: It affects our ability to get loans in the future.

1130
02:07:06,807 --> 02:07:08,508
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just not good practice.

1131
02:07:08,528 --> 02:07:09,208
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think people,

1132
02:07:10,112 --> 02:07:15,454
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll continue to bring that up in the future.

1133
02:07:15,674 --> 02:07:30,521
[SPEAKER_09]: $26 million in free cash for 28 million is not a, it is a fairly normal amount of money to have in the reserves for a city with an operating budget of $218 million.

1134
02:07:30,741 --> 02:07:32,202
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's not unusual.

1135
02:07:32,622 --> 02:07:37,424
[SPEAKER_09]: In the history of Medford, where we used to operate with no free cash at all, it is a lot.

1136
02:07:40,462 --> 02:07:45,085
[SPEAKER_09]: but we should never have been in a position where we're operating with almost no free cash at all.

1137
02:07:45,146 --> 02:07:47,547
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that a lot of residents are seeing this.

1138
02:07:47,567 --> 02:07:54,813
[SPEAKER_09]: They're like, why don't we spend that money when they're, when what they're thinking about is a history of poor financial practice that they took for granted.

1139
02:07:55,353 --> 02:07:58,776
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think what's going to happen with that is it's going to keep, it's going to keep coming up.

1140
02:07:58,836 --> 02:08:08,643
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there's a combination of people who genuinely misunderstand, um, the differences between free cash and operating budgets and people who will keep bringing it, bringing it up in,

1141
02:08:10,323 --> 02:08:14,325
[SPEAKER_09]: when they actually do understand that, but they just kind of want to use it for political purposes.

1142
02:08:14,365 --> 02:08:16,427
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's just a reality that we're looking at.

1143
02:08:18,408 --> 02:08:27,794
[SPEAKER_09]: What I'll say my personal frustrations are with it, though, is that I do see that we're expending a very significant amount of free cash on things that we do need.

1144
02:08:28,479 --> 02:08:29,800
[SPEAKER_09]: the HVAC systems we need.

1145
02:08:29,880 --> 02:08:38,303
[SPEAKER_09]: I am absolutely fine putting up $5 million for air conditioning for our school systems in addition to the $25 million loan.

1146
02:08:38,824 --> 02:08:56,832
[SPEAKER_09]: But there's also other studies that I really want to see happen that would cost a much smaller amount of money, like the NEXUS study to update our linkage fees or a new study to update the entirety of the capital improvements program, which would cost

1147
02:08:58,194 --> 02:09:04,477
[SPEAKER_09]: Under $200,000, I would like to see a transportation demand management study, which would really help development in the city.

1148
02:09:05,278 --> 02:09:10,420
[SPEAKER_09]: And those as I see them are very significant investments.

1149
02:09:11,341 --> 02:09:17,564
[SPEAKER_09]: But we're not spending it on those, even though the returns on those studies would be humongous.

1150
02:09:18,144 --> 02:09:21,846
[SPEAKER_09]: And I did put those in as asks to the administration.

1151
02:09:24,331 --> 02:09:31,800
[SPEAKER_09]: And I do understand that the mayor attempted to pay for that with the sale of McCormick Avenue, but this this council voted it down.

1152
02:09:33,182 --> 02:09:42,333
[SPEAKER_09]: We disagreed on selling off public land for that but even so with, you know, for me personally saying the $28 million that we have and then we're not willing to spend it on.

1153
02:09:43,775 --> 02:09:56,100
[SPEAKER_09]: what is a relatively small amount for studies that would pay hugely in the future, um, is something that I'm I'm a little bit frustrated with.

1154
02:09:56,460 --> 02:09:58,040
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's all I have to say.

1155
02:09:58,080 --> 02:09:58,420
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1156
02:10:02,282 --> 02:10:04,263
[SPEAKER_05]: You have a response to a specific concern.

1157
02:10:05,503 --> 02:10:07,944
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than to say President Bears that I, um,

1158
02:10:09,868 --> 02:10:10,108
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.

1159
02:10:10,128 --> 02:10:27,373
[SPEAKER_00]: That generally speaking, I with without necessarily commenting on the Elements of the City Council's requested, um, budget FY 26 budget requests because we're still working through.

1160
02:10:27,393 --> 02:10:30,373
[SPEAKER_00]: I can say that I generally agree with the

1161
02:10:37,414 --> 02:10:54,473
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that is probably the most succinct way to articulate the difference between one-time funds and operating funds is to say that if I

1162
02:10:55,755 --> 02:11:01,058
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say I was eligible for overtime, which fortunately I'm not, so I'm not paid overtime.

1163
02:11:02,559 --> 02:11:04,541
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were, let's say any one of us were working.

1164
02:11:04,641 --> 02:11:06,782
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Councilman was referring to one-time fund requests.

1165
02:11:06,902 --> 02:11:07,683
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I understand.

1166
02:11:07,763 --> 02:11:08,903
[SPEAKER_05]: We split our fiscal 26 requests.

1167
02:11:09,163 --> 02:11:15,988
[SPEAKER_05]: It's mostly operating, but there were several requests for the use of one-time funds, and I think that's what Councilman was referring to.

1168
02:11:16,008 --> 02:11:16,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1169
02:11:16,288 --> 02:11:21,371
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was one-time funds for a couple of specific one-time only projects.

1170
02:11:21,611 --> 02:11:21,771
[SPEAKER_00]: I see.

1171
02:11:21,791 --> 02:11:22,212
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1172
02:11:22,972 --> 02:11:24,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Just so we don't go down a road.

1173
02:11:24,353 --> 02:11:25,474
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I will take those back.

1174
02:11:25,954 --> 02:11:31,278
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I bet that is a matter that's still under review as a part of the process.

1175
02:11:31,318 --> 02:11:49,771
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll say this just as one councillor that in a year when operating expenses are not something that we can, we're not looking at significant changes and increases, maybe some of these smaller things that could go, I agree with Councilor Livingston, a long way might be a way to move some things forward.

1176
02:11:50,051 --> 02:11:51,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Just two cents.

1177
02:11:51,412 --> 02:11:52,373
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to go to Councilor Scarpelli.

1178
02:11:55,138 --> 02:11:56,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor, our President.

1179
02:11:56,545 --> 02:11:57,329
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate you.

1180
02:11:59,454 --> 02:12:14,243
[SPEAKER_04]: I think first, let me start off by saying, because I've listened to my colleagues and the Chief of Staff speak this evening, and I've heard the comment being used that one person's view toward another person's view is political.

1181
02:12:14,663 --> 02:12:27,151
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's wrong to look at what we do as elected officials who are political in opening different sides of different issues.

1182
02:12:27,953 --> 02:12:33,254
[SPEAKER_04]: When we look at what I just heard, let's look at what the truths are.

1183
02:12:34,114 --> 02:12:48,778
[SPEAKER_04]: The truths are that we've had professionals as close as the State Assessors Association that came out and spoke and eloquently discussed the process of free cash and what would be needed.

1184
02:12:49,298 --> 02:12:52,459
[SPEAKER_04]: And we talked about why it's so important in Medford and bond rating.

1185
02:12:52,959 --> 02:12:56,840
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've also understood that a city of Medford size

1186
02:12:57,778 --> 02:13:04,040
[SPEAKER_04]: with our budget, a number of seven to $11 million would not hurt our bond rating.

1187
02:13:04,860 --> 02:13:15,183
[SPEAKER_04]: And the number that we're seeing year after year of 26, 24, $28 million in free cash is a problem.

1188
02:13:16,563 --> 02:13:20,664
[SPEAKER_04]: To say that we're in fiscal times and that this is crisis, we are.

1189
02:13:21,045 --> 02:13:22,445
[SPEAKER_04]: It's crisis of mismanagement.

1190
02:13:23,985 --> 02:13:27,908
[SPEAKER_04]: where other communities, neighboring communities, are thriving.

1191
02:13:28,888 --> 02:13:31,110
[SPEAKER_04]: We used it again, the pandemic.

1192
02:13:33,111 --> 02:13:37,314
[SPEAKER_04]: We have communities that are thriving off of the proper use of ARPA money.

1193
02:13:38,935 --> 02:13:44,939
[SPEAKER_04]: And you wanna talk about using money correctly, this is the reason why we're in this situation.

1194
02:13:45,179 --> 02:13:50,843
[SPEAKER_04]: You're seeing neighboring communities now, they're in the same situations because they used ARPA money in the wrong format.

1195
02:13:52,368 --> 02:14:19,262
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you look at the disingenuine discussions of the use of ARPA money, the use of free cash and understanding the issues that we've had here historically, historically, we haven't had shovel in the ground for new growth and development and the scale that brings in revenue that would support and assist our taxpayers in almost six years now.

1196
02:14:20,182 --> 02:14:30,226
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe there are two projects going on now that we would hope that would stop bringing in some real revenue, whether it's the Felsway site or the Mystic Valley Parkway site.

1197
02:14:31,126 --> 02:14:40,850
[SPEAKER_04]: But these are projects that should have been put forth years ago, no different than what we're doing right now with the zoning and looking at the Method Square Corridor and looking what we're doing there.

1198
02:14:42,250 --> 02:14:48,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's the vision that changes what we will be looking at for financial distress.

1199
02:14:49,605 --> 02:15:11,280
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you move forward, and we look at our future, there's undertones that the $7.5 million, although huge and although very, very painful to a lot of at-risk Medford residents, that that simply isn't enough.

1200
02:15:13,118 --> 02:15:21,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I've heard from different department heads about asked to be cut that we need a million dollars being cut through the city's budget, and we're in dire straits again.

1201
02:15:23,487 --> 02:15:28,031
[SPEAKER_04]: When we, when we, when we, when we year after year.

1202
02:15:29,220 --> 02:15:32,841
[SPEAKER_04]: find ourselves with millions and millions of dollars in free cash.

1203
02:15:33,441 --> 02:15:39,863
[SPEAKER_04]: The comments that you made, Madam Chief of Staff, is just total, total disingenuine.

1204
02:15:40,324 --> 02:15:43,705
[SPEAKER_04]: When $28 million isn't a bad number, of course it is.

1205
02:15:44,965 --> 02:15:45,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course it is.

1206
02:15:46,565 --> 02:15:54,248
[SPEAKER_04]: State professionals, assessors have already stated that $7 to $11 million is what we're looking at in the city of Medford size.

1207
02:15:55,415 --> 02:16:03,619
[SPEAKER_04]: When you're looking at $28 million in free cash, that means we've done something wrong when it comes to managing our finances in this community.

1208
02:16:04,840 --> 02:16:15,006
[SPEAKER_04]: So although it's a different view of my colleagues, if you wanna spin it to make it sound as if it's political, go at it, go at it.

1209
02:16:16,266 --> 02:16:24,451
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's a group of citizens in this community that are really hurting for some serious changes that have happened in this last fiscal year.

1210
02:16:26,400 --> 02:16:34,425
[SPEAKER_04]: that they're probably leaving the city or doing some drastic, drastic cuts in their own personal lives and their personal health because of the moves that we've been making.

1211
02:16:35,165 --> 02:16:48,133
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just, I'm just a little leery and a little nervous that this council is starting to plan maybe another future override for the fact that what we're hearing on 2027, things are going to get worse.

1212
02:16:50,654 --> 02:16:53,616
[SPEAKER_04]: It's easy to say, sit around a table and say, yep, we're all right.

1213
02:16:53,696 --> 02:16:54,276
[SPEAKER_04]: This is great.

1214
02:16:54,336 --> 02:16:55,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's all pat ourselves on the back.

1215
02:16:57,565 --> 02:17:03,508
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's disingenuous to say that $28 million again in free cash isn't a factor of mismanagement.

1216
02:17:04,128 --> 02:17:04,748
[SPEAKER_04]: You're wrong.

1217
02:17:05,668 --> 02:17:10,470
[SPEAKER_04]: We've already had professionals express that over and over again, but some people just don't want to listen.

1218
02:17:11,551 --> 02:17:12,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1219
02:17:15,172 --> 02:17:16,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Leming.

1220
02:17:19,058 --> 02:17:27,424
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think the argument that we have too much free cash is something I would disagree with.

1221
02:17:27,444 --> 02:17:38,051
[SPEAKER_09]: The argument that I disagree with, which was what was continuously brought up during the override, was that we should take staff salaries out of free cash and not have an override.

1222
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:43,163
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that was, I mean, that's a change in narrative.

1223
02:17:43,223 --> 02:17:57,275
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I think that everybody here would like to see the amount of free cash that we have spent on capital projects as it should be spent on, but the arguments that were being made

1224
02:17:58,480 --> 02:18:09,622
[SPEAKER_09]: During this override were again that if we did not have one, and we just put all our free cash towards teacher salaries and we would be completely tapped out in a few years.

1225
02:18:10,590 --> 02:18:27,263
[SPEAKER_09]: So that is the first time that I've heard my colleague say that, whereas before he was saying that we should be just paying for our staff shortfalls from the override.

1226
02:18:27,463 --> 02:18:30,706
[SPEAKER_09]: Now it's like, okay, no, we have too much free cash.

1227
02:18:30,766 --> 02:18:33,988
[SPEAKER_09]: We should have less because we need to spend it on things.

1228
02:18:34,349 --> 02:18:35,129
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I agree with that.

1229
02:18:37,594 --> 02:18:41,238
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a different argument entirely from what was being brought up before.

1230
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:52,530
[SPEAKER_09]: I do think that we need to spend the free cash that we have on capital projects.

1231
02:18:55,113 --> 02:18:56,294
[SPEAKER_09]: We can still have a

1232
02:18:57,659 --> 02:19:06,226
[SPEAKER_09]: $1 million deficit, because again, this is the difference between money that is used for capital expenses and money that is used for ongoing operating expenses.

1233
02:19:08,168 --> 02:19:13,412
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, I mean, I was just wanting to make that point.

1234
02:19:13,452 --> 02:19:23,821
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, and in terms of a future override, like the intent of prop two and a half was to have periodic overrides.

1235
02:19:25,112 --> 02:19:33,063
[SPEAKER_09]: Medford waited 40 years before we even had one override, which was far too long for a city of our size.

1236
02:19:33,563 --> 02:19:36,087
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, could the next override happen in another 40 years?

1237
02:19:37,472 --> 02:19:37,752
[SPEAKER_09]: maybe.

1238
02:19:38,073 --> 02:19:49,381
[SPEAKER_09]: But the point is that in a city's entire existence, I mean with the way that this is designed, you can't just have a single override and then expect that to be okay.

1239
02:19:49,421 --> 02:19:54,785
[SPEAKER_09]: If you look at the state databanks with other municipalities that have had

1240
02:19:55,605 --> 02:19:59,068
[SPEAKER_09]: It shows like the history of override of these other municipalities in the past.

1241
02:19:59,108 --> 02:20:03,792
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, they have continued, like different municipalities have continuously had overrides.

1242
02:20:04,833 --> 02:20:11,398
[SPEAKER_09]: Normally, like sometimes every 10 years, sometimes every five years, sometimes they'll do one in like the year 2000 and then they'll do one in 2021.

1243
02:20:11,658 --> 02:20:14,681
[SPEAKER_09]: It just varies depending on the state of the economy and the needs of the budget.

1244
02:20:14,761 --> 02:20:21,546
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, like trying to act like it's a boogeyman thing to say, oh, we might need another override in the future.

1245
02:20:21,566 --> 02:20:23,347
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just like, okay.

1246
02:20:24,364 --> 02:20:35,286
[SPEAKER_09]: yeah, we might, I hope it's not in the next 10 to 15 years, but you know, it could happen just depend it, it will likely need to happen at some time in the more distant future.

1247
02:20:35,306 --> 02:20:40,628
[SPEAKER_09]: So, so yeah, those are, that's, that's the points that, that I wanted to make.

1248
02:20:40,668 --> 02:20:45,509
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I don't disagree with my colleague that we need less free, that we should have less free cash than we have.

1249
02:20:45,589 --> 02:20:51,670
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a frustration of mine, but that's not what, that's not the argument that was being made previously.

1250
02:20:53,450 --> 02:20:54,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of clarification, Mr. President.

1251
02:20:55,652 --> 02:20:56,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1252
02:20:56,853 --> 02:20:57,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1253
02:20:57,713 --> 02:21:16,948
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate my fellow colleague for the words, but obviously he wasn't listening to me during the override discussions, because what my battle with the override was that over and over again, and it's a public comment, and I could share it with him again with the videos, but again, it was stated over and over again.

1254
02:21:16,968 --> 02:21:22,352
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the fact that this council didn't think we needed an override, but through the process,

1255
02:21:23,423 --> 02:21:28,385
[SPEAKER_04]: and how we got to the override, how it was pushed through, how it was rushed, and how we weren't prepared, in my view.

1256
02:21:29,105 --> 02:21:38,869
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I said at the time was, looking at the shortfall with the school department, that one-time funding, to correct those issues.

1257
02:21:39,089 --> 02:21:49,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Because by the way, some of the money that's in free cash are salaries that were not used year after year for positions that were left open.

1258
02:21:50,558 --> 02:22:00,484
[SPEAKER_04]: So to use those funds to fix the school's budget concerns and issues without dividing the community, that's what I said over and over again.

1259
02:22:01,624 --> 02:22:16,653
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we can sit together with time and look at the process to see if we truly needed an override, and if we did, to prepare our community, especially our most needy community members that needed the assistance to prepare themselves for this,

1260
02:22:18,793 --> 02:22:20,654
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the process that I was looking for.

1261
02:22:20,674 --> 02:22:24,896
[SPEAKER_04]: I never said to use free cash over and over again.

1262
02:22:25,296 --> 02:22:26,797
[SPEAKER_04]: That never came out of my mouth.

1263
02:22:28,157 --> 02:22:43,163
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, it's easy to spin the dialogue to make it sound what's good on the other side, but it's very simply put, what we needed for the city, in my view, opposite from my colleagues, and I understand that that's the political process, that's the democratic process.

1264
02:22:44,600 --> 02:22:49,504
[SPEAKER_04]: But my battle wasn't about not needing an override and not understanding if we need an override.

1265
02:22:51,025 --> 02:23:06,858
[SPEAKER_04]: The battle was, or the understanding was, to slow the process down and use one-time funds of the 24, $26 million we had at the time to support the school department and then prepare our community if that was the need.

1266
02:23:08,159 --> 02:23:10,301
[SPEAKER_04]: But here we are again, $28 million in free cash,

1267
02:23:12,982 --> 02:23:22,730
[SPEAKER_04]: and one of our leaders of City Hall has just told us that's okay, that's not a big deal to have $28 million in free cash.

1268
02:23:23,410 --> 02:23:24,191
[SPEAKER_04]: That's absurd.

1269
02:23:26,653 --> 02:23:26,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1270
02:23:29,355 --> 02:23:29,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1271
02:23:30,276 --> 02:23:32,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that still Councilor Leming?

1272
02:23:32,838 --> 02:23:39,403
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to avoid just, I mean, I'll recognize you, but Councilor Leming.

1273
02:23:39,623 --> 02:23:41,685
[SPEAKER_09]: I would get in a back and forth about this,

1274
02:23:42,469 --> 02:23:47,473
[SPEAKER_09]: I, I don't really think it's worth it at this point we, we had plenty of these conversations.

1275
02:23:49,254 --> 02:23:57,561
[SPEAKER_09]: During the override so I don't, I really don't feel like rehashing this at this point I mean everybody remembers what was said so yeah that's that.

1276
02:23:58,662 --> 02:24:04,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'll send the video, I'll send the video Mr. President, just to remind my fellow council that well that's, yeah.

1277
02:24:04,446 --> 02:24:04,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you.

1278
02:24:13,210 --> 02:24:25,480
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not the 28 million it's not nothing but again we have an HVAC project that's worth 30 million so when I said it was not insignificant I, I mean it is something but again it addresses like one capital project if we spend it all on that.

1279
02:24:26,961 --> 02:24:32,405
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just wanted to bring this up and again this is just from the ACFR and the budgets and it's not from Bob, but

1280
02:24:34,147 --> 02:24:39,430
[SPEAKER_05]: Fiscal, some of the big free cash changes, Fiscal 22 and Fiscal 23, there was a $9.8 million increase, then an $8.7 million increase.

1281
02:24:39,450 --> 02:24:41,492
[SPEAKER_05]: But in those years, we used $8.6 million in ARPA and $7.6 million in ARPA.

1282
02:24:41,512 --> 02:24:43,413
[SPEAKER_05]: So the actual free cash would have gone if ARPA didn't exist.

1283
02:24:55,309 --> 02:24:59,510
[SPEAKER_05]: would just have been 1.2 million in fiscal 22 and 1.1 million in fiscal 23.

1284
02:24:59,630 --> 02:25:16,716
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we talk about the city's, you know, underspending, you know, that revenues came in above expectations and spending were below expectations, that only, without ARPA, that only would have meant about a million dollar increase in free cash.

1285
02:25:16,736 --> 02:25:17,577
[SPEAKER_05]: So

1286
02:25:19,612 --> 02:25:24,033
[SPEAKER_05]: It is, I think we're having a debate about the source of free cash.

1287
02:25:24,073 --> 02:25:28,595
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we all agree that it should be used for the purpose of the city in a quick way.

1288
02:25:28,635 --> 02:25:33,896
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds like we have differences on how it should be used or how it maybe should have been used last year.

1289
02:25:35,997 --> 02:25:45,319
[SPEAKER_05]: But without ARPA, we'd be looking at $1 million increases, which is, you know, 0.25% of the general fund budget.

1290
02:25:45,680 --> 02:25:46,680
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really,

1291
02:25:48,171 --> 02:25:49,792
[SPEAKER_05]: not a huge surplus.

1292
02:25:51,112 --> 02:25:52,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Go to the Chief of Staff.

1293
02:25:53,373 --> 02:25:54,153
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, President Bears.

1294
02:25:54,393 --> 02:26:10,498
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be very selective with my comments because I think, President Bears, through you to Councilor Scarpelli, I think we can fundamentally say we may disagree on how the landscape has shaped itself in the past several years.

1295
02:26:11,238 --> 02:26:14,560
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think everyone on this council is here.

1296
02:26:14,580 --> 02:26:24,265
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone on this council is trying to do everything that they believe everything in their power, um, to move the city forward.

1297
02:26:25,025 --> 02:26:33,269
[SPEAKER_00]: That said, I understand that there are competing factors, and I'm just going to clarify one thing so that there's no ambiguity on the matter.

1298
02:26:34,149 --> 02:26:44,472
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want anyone to walk away from this conversation thinking that the comment that I made about fiscal 27 being a difficult year was a tee up for an override.

1299
02:26:44,932 --> 02:26:47,533
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be clear, I was not coming here to say that.

1300
02:26:48,693 --> 02:26:53,235
[SPEAKER_00]: That was stated here this evening, and I just want to restate that

1301
02:26:54,535 --> 02:26:55,896
[SPEAKER_00]: we're making that known.

1302
02:26:56,797 --> 02:27:00,580
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's a fact and we plan to work to build that in.

1303
02:27:01,081 --> 02:27:03,383
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to be very clear about that.

1304
02:27:03,543 --> 02:27:09,788
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want there to be any misconceptions that that was planting a seed for an override for the future as it pertained to the challenges of FY 27.

1305
02:27:09,828 --> 02:27:10,308
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1306
02:27:10,469 --> 02:27:10,769
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1307
02:27:12,610 --> 02:27:17,434
[SPEAKER_05]: If anything else on the law department budget, which is where we started.

1308
02:27:19,536 --> 02:27:20,237
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, President Bears.

1309
02:27:20,317 --> 02:27:22,679
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not unless the council members have further questions.

1310
02:27:23,134 --> 02:27:24,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing none, we can go to the executive.

1311
02:27:25,775 --> 02:27:27,196
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll just quickly read it off.

1312
02:27:29,637 --> 02:27:36,401
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the executive, which is the office of the mayor, and we have fiscal 25 budget, 673,270.

1313
02:27:36,601 --> 02:27:37,141
[SPEAKER_05]: Fiscal 26 proposed, 693,388.

1314
02:27:37,181 --> 02:27:37,822
[SPEAKER_05]: That's an increase of $17,118.

1315
02:27:48,750 --> 02:27:54,392
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like we do have a reduction in the personnel with the special projects coordinator position is gone away.

1316
02:27:54,572 --> 02:27:55,932
[SPEAKER_05]: It's seen nods there.

1317
02:27:55,952 --> 02:28:08,015
[SPEAKER_05]: The fixed cost growth driving that 17,000 was personnel lines, partially shifting the communication specialist position to the city as well as cost of living and step increases.

1318
02:28:08,736 --> 02:28:17,218
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have increase in the C click fix contract, increase in MMA membership dues, and a general inflation cost for

1319
02:28:18,370 --> 02:28:19,331
[SPEAKER_05]: costs pertaining to events.

1320
02:28:19,631 --> 02:28:21,812
[SPEAKER_05]: And with that, I will turn it over to the chief of staff.

1321
02:28:22,693 --> 02:28:27,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Feel free to talk about the change any of your highlights in the office or plans for the year.

1322
02:28:27,897 --> 02:28:34,721
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know it's a little tougher because the mayor's office so it's, you know, let's not talk about the whole city, let's keep it keep the scope narrow.

1323
02:28:35,462 --> 02:28:40,345
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if there's things that is specifically within the executive, there may be, you know,

1324
02:28:41,673 --> 02:28:43,435
[SPEAKER_05]: needs or desires that currently can't be funded.

1325
02:28:43,475 --> 02:28:49,123
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we're happy to hear about that, although we do think this department has a unique level of control over those types of things.

1326
02:28:51,286 --> 02:28:52,007
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, President Bears.

1327
02:28:53,949 --> 02:28:56,292
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally speaking, you know, as you've characterized the

1328
02:28:58,218 --> 02:29:01,899
[SPEAKER_00]: The service level is largely not changing within the office.

1329
02:29:01,919 --> 02:29:06,420
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no additional new employee proposed positions.

1330
02:29:06,500 --> 02:29:10,781
[SPEAKER_00]: The service level in terms of number of FTEs is largely the same.

1331
02:29:12,461 --> 02:29:19,203
[SPEAKER_00]: The difference here is we have, as you mentioned, the special projects coordinator position going away, and in turn,

1332
02:29:21,657 --> 02:29:27,959
[SPEAKER_00]: proposed internship funding, filling some of the void that's left from that effectively from that role.

1333
02:29:29,260 --> 02:29:48,087
[SPEAKER_00]: The changes in moving previously funded positions outside of the budget into more into the budget, as they, you know, effectively impact the budget, and that those are largely the changes, but we do continue to have some

1334
02:29:49,888 --> 02:30:03,041
[SPEAKER_00]: grant funding integrated into the salaries and wages of these some of the staff members here, in particular, the communication specialist is being funded and and largely working on health matters and under the bar Foundation grant.

1335
02:30:04,001 --> 02:30:07,004
[SPEAKER_00]: Um So really not too much going on there.

1336
02:30:07,044 --> 02:30:12,269
[SPEAKER_00]: There are fixed cost increases pertaining to see click fix the city's, um

1337
02:30:13,130 --> 02:30:20,005
[SPEAKER_00]: basically report reporting software so that residents can report issues with, you know, potholes and

1338
02:30:22,472 --> 02:30:25,794
[SPEAKER_00]: you know that that continues to be a challenging, um.

1339
02:30:26,714 --> 02:30:32,137
[SPEAKER_00]: Challenging work that is, you know, completing the potholes, but I'm not trying to go down any further slippery slopes here today.

1340
02:30:32,417 --> 02:30:34,498
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've met my quota there.

1341
02:30:35,118 --> 02:30:39,020
[SPEAKER_00]: Um I really don't have any other further comments.

1342
02:30:39,060 --> 02:30:40,500
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's pretty straightforward.

1343
02:30:41,341 --> 02:30:46,984
[SPEAKER_00]: Um I will reserve comments on the work of the department for the mayor and any further, um

1344
02:30:49,124 --> 02:30:55,627
[SPEAKER_00]: Submissions that she would like to make because it's really truly under her leadership that that the department is able to do the work that it does.

1345
02:30:55,807 --> 02:31:08,451
[SPEAKER_00]: And frankly, under the leadership of the many departments and, um Boards and committees that this organization has that Do all the tremendous work that's that's done year in and year out.

1346
02:31:09,232 --> 02:31:09,492
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1347
02:31:11,212 --> 02:31:11,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

1348
02:31:11,412 --> 02:31:12,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have any questions about the executive?

1349
02:31:16,560 --> 02:31:17,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing none, I do.

1350
02:31:20,382 --> 02:31:22,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Just three quick questions.

1351
02:31:22,684 --> 02:31:23,945
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a reduction in the stipends.

1352
02:31:23,965 --> 02:31:25,366
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just wondering what happened there.

1353
02:31:27,367 --> 02:31:28,087
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

1354
02:31:28,167 --> 02:31:38,634
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not entirely clear on the history as to why, but historically, the stipend for part, I believe it was part of the stipend for the

1355
02:31:41,338 --> 02:31:50,343
[SPEAKER_00]: the mayor as the chair of the school committee was in this budget, for whatever reasons, it's now no longer in this budget and it's in the school department budget.

1356
02:31:51,203 --> 02:31:54,525
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the shift, that's the reduction because it's just moved to a different place.

1357
02:31:55,026 --> 02:31:55,526
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

1358
02:31:55,546 --> 02:32:01,029
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, if there's any more history on that, that would be good to know.

1359
02:32:02,970 --> 02:32:03,471
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.

1360
02:32:03,791 --> 02:32:11,417
[SPEAKER_00]: Frankly, I'm not sure why it's in the city side budget or was in the city side budget, but it's no longer in the city side budget, so.

1361
02:32:15,380 --> 02:32:18,883
[SPEAKER_05]: On the Arts Council, I'm just seeing a zero actuals for fiscal 25.

1362
02:32:20,721 --> 02:32:24,503
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm kind of just wondering about general activity of the Arts Council.

1363
02:32:24,643 --> 02:32:30,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Has there been difficulties in finding appointees or why the spending is down?

1364
02:32:30,286 --> 02:32:35,950
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially at this time, I think it's more important than ever with federal cuts to arts and humanities funding.

1365
02:32:35,970 --> 02:32:37,931
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that's some essential funds.

1366
02:32:39,912 --> 02:32:40,172
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1367
02:32:41,963 --> 02:32:54,018
[SPEAKER_00]: What I can speak to on this one, because I don't have specific information on membership and the like, it's my understanding that this is more of an accounting matter.

1368
02:32:54,879 --> 02:33:00,747
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an accounting entry that's made, and I recall seeing an email communication from our former

1369
02:33:01,427 --> 02:33:15,295
[SPEAKER_00]: finance assistant finance director and budget manager who, as the council knows, is still working part time for the city in a budget management position through this budget cycle that flagged that we hadn't made that accounting entry.

1370
02:33:15,675 --> 02:33:20,097
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really more of an accounting entry, but the back end I don't have further information on at this point.

1371
02:33:20,477 --> 02:33:25,080
[SPEAKER_05]: If we could put in if anyone would move to just request an update on the Arts Council

1372
02:33:27,161 --> 02:33:33,343
[SPEAKER_05]: totally hear you that it's an accounting question, but I've also gotten some questions from folks in the community.

1373
02:33:33,463 --> 02:33:34,944
[SPEAKER_05]: How can I be more engaged with the Arts Council?

1374
02:33:34,984 --> 02:33:44,907
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also know some former members of the Arts Council have had to step away due to just not having the time to be able to put into the volunteer role.

1375
02:33:44,927 --> 02:33:47,708
[SPEAKER_05]: So just wondering if any of that is

1376
02:33:49,923 --> 02:33:50,804
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that all connected?

1377
02:33:50,864 --> 02:33:57,810
[SPEAKER_05]: And if there's some way that maybe the Council could be supportive or get the message out, we need some folks for the Arts Council.

1378
02:33:57,830 --> 02:34:02,174
[SPEAKER_05]: And I could be completely wrong too, right?

1379
02:34:02,274 --> 02:34:04,816
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just kind of trying to put together some stuff I've been hearing.

1380
02:34:06,798 --> 02:34:08,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there someone who would make that motion?

1381
02:34:12,663 --> 02:34:13,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Tseng?

1382
02:34:15,105 --> 02:34:15,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

1383
02:34:18,752 --> 02:34:22,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, just an update on the Arts Council, yeah.

1384
02:34:23,753 --> 02:34:29,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Last thing, and if we need to save this for HR, I totally understand, but do you have an update on the classification and compensation study?

1385
02:34:31,296 --> 02:34:34,857
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that's a good question for the human resources director when she's here.

1386
02:34:35,217 --> 02:34:37,758
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1387
02:34:37,838 --> 02:34:44,319
[SPEAKER_00]: At a high level, I know it's being worked on, and I know that the HR administrator that was hired to fill the

1388
02:34:48,683 --> 02:34:55,909
[SPEAKER_00]: special projects administrator position, which was ARPA funded, has been working diligently on that project.

1389
02:34:55,929 --> 02:34:56,650
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1390
02:34:56,690 --> 02:34:57,530
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to get that wrapped up.

1391
02:34:57,791 --> 02:34:58,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Bring it back up.

1392
02:34:58,491 --> 02:35:02,695
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have to put in the report, but if you want to give him a heads up, I'm going to ask the question.

1393
02:35:02,715 --> 02:35:02,935
Sure.

1394
02:35:02,955 --> 02:35:03,115
Great.

1395
02:35:03,135 --> 02:35:04,036
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1396
02:35:04,056 --> 02:35:09,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have any other questions on the executive budget?

1397
02:35:12,823 --> 02:35:14,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing none, do we have any comments from members of the public?

1398
02:35:19,992 --> 02:35:21,953
[SPEAKER_05]: second.

1399
02:35:22,013 --> 02:35:24,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but this is the second one on the second motion.

1400
02:35:24,416 --> 02:35:25,777
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Council on the second.

1401
02:35:25,917 --> 02:35:28,459
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned his second on the first one.

1402
02:35:28,599 --> 02:35:29,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1403
02:35:29,220 --> 02:35:29,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

1404
02:35:29,580 --> 02:35:30,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Here is a second.

1405
02:35:30,681 --> 02:35:32,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Could you could you reread the motions?

1406

[SPEAKER_02]: Council.

[SPEAKER_02]: How much time officers are spending, uh, responding to animal control issues outside of city hall hours, and that's the one that needs a second.

[SPEAKER_05]: seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.

1410

[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a motion to refer the questions to the administration, keep the papering committee and adjourn?
