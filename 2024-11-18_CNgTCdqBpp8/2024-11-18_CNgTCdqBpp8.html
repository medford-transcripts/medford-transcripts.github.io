    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=135.746s">Madam</a>  Councilor Good evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=137.127s">I'd</a>  like to <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=138.912s">My</a>  name is Derek Redgate. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=140.634s">I</a>  work, I'm a civil engineer with High Point Engineering representing Needham Bank who is here with us tonight as well for any questions that you may have. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=150.543s">I'd</a>  like your permission and maybe your recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=153.866s">I</a>  have, I have some graphical handouts that I'd like to hand out. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=158.731s">If</a>  I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=159.091s">You</a>  will pass them around. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=166.843s">And</a>  then for the audience at home, in the video, I have a tripod with some graphics as well, which I can set up anywhere you think is the best viewing spot, whether it's inside or just outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=183.369s">Right</a>  in front of me. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=184.49s">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=185.59s">Just</a>  wanna pass it over. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=218.897s">Oh,</a>  yeah.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=231.099s">Shane,</a>  can you turn the camera? <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=237.581s">Yes,</a>  Shane. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=239.401s">Shane,</a>  can you hear me? <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=241.221s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=241.481s">A</a>  little out of it? <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=242.782s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=243.162s">He's</a>  okay.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=243.522s">He's</a>  turning.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=250.593s">I</a>  think we'll build the Taj Mahal as a drafter.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=259.776s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=260.496s">Again,</a>  my name is Derek Redgate. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=262.217s">I'm</a>  with High Point Engineering in Dedham. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=265.078s">I'm</a>  a civil engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=266.818s">Also</a>  with me tonight is representatives of Needham Bank, including Jim White, who is the Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=279.197s">And</a>  then also on Zoom is the architect for the project, Ron Cocaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=283.52s">So</a>  if there's any questions related to the architecture, he's available via Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=289.765s">We're</a>  here for a special permit under section 11.6. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=295.789s">The</a>  project's located at 270 Mystic Avenue, the intersection of Mystic Ave and Mystic Valley Parkway. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=303.451s">It's</a>  currently a brick office building, two stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=308.676s">It's</a>  about 10,300 square feet, and it's currently vacant. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=314.081s">It's</a>  on a 26,000 square foot lot, which is a little bit more than a half an acre. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=321.769s">The</a>  parcel is located in Zoning District C2. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=325.8s">And</a>  under the chart for uses, drive-through uses are an allowed use with a special permit from City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=337.403s">So</a>  that is why we're here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=342.484s">Other</a>  than that, this is a by-right project. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=345.784s">We</a>  won't be seeking any more relief from other boards. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=351.025s">It's</a>  strictly the, <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=355.425s">relief</a>  for a drive-through in the C2. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=362.107s">Again,</a>  it's a 10,300 square foot brick building. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=365.568s">It</a>  currently has 30 parking spaces and our use will be operating under the same parking demand and we'll be able to maintain the required 30 spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=380.152s">There's</a>  gonna be a full renovation of the brick building. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=387.488s">renovation</a>  on the interior, facade renovations, which I have some graphics and are part of the handout that I gave you some renderings of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=400.213s">And</a>  we'd like to locate an ATM machine, but also a full service window. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=409.637s">And</a>  if you look at, I'm trying to, <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=413.154s">look</a>  at the plans and I can show you where it is, but it's towards the back right corner of the graphic, which we felt was the most appropriate location for the ATM and the driver. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=432.994s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=433.234s">Yeah,</a>  I think it's important though to have someone from Needham Bank also sort of talk about the history in the city with another branch and new employees and things like that.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=446.759s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=450.021s">Thank</a>  you for your presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=451.662s">I</a>  think most of us are familiar with that building and I think it is more than enough room there to accomplish what you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=459.528s">I</a>  think this will be maybe a start of the upgrading of mystic Avenue with this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=469.531s">Again,</a>  if you showed the picture where you're gonna be redoing the whole property and making it, upgrading the look of it, this might be a small shot in the arm for the avenue that needs maybe to get some other people interested in the surrounding property around it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=486.557s">So</a>  again, the last time I think I did a survey, someone else was looking for a drive-thru window some years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=498.813s">is</a>  really not a major backup of cars, I don't think. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=502.415s">And</a>  I've talked to the other ones, I don't think, 50, 60 a day, 70 a day, that's on the big end, and they won't all be queuing at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=511.218s">But</a>  I think you get more than that from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=514.8s">You'll</a>  be upgrading the look of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=516.641s">It'll</a>  maybe give the avenue a little bit of a shot in the eye too. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=519.922s">Yeah,</a>  we agree, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=521.543s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=522.423s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=523.784s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=524.684s">So</a>  again, thank you for the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=527.476s">What's</a>  glaring right now is that what we have there, what's existing there, and prior to the past location, it was a huge public safety issue because as Mystic Ave backed up, people would fly through the Bank of America parking lot, just cut over onto the sidewalk right in front. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=550.449s">It</a>  looks like you're putting a landscape, and is that a fence right to the corner?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=555.558s">Yeah,</a>  we're aware of the opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=562.403s">We're</a>  gonna sign it appropriately. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=564.865s">We're</a>  hoping to sign it where you can only enter through Mystic Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=570.95s">And</a>  there is some traffic calming devices that are there right now in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=579.636s">And</a>  so we would try to copy them in kind. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=583.759s">But</a>  we will also look at <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=585.896s">look</a>  at that issue when we go to a final design of the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=590.717s">The</a>  bank would not want people cutting through.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=593.158s">Right,</a>  we know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=593.758s">So</a>  that's why I would support. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=596.098s">I</a>  think that the update looks beautiful. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=599.359s">I</a>  think that, like Councilor Caraviello says, this should be a gateway to our, probably one of our most intriguing neighborhoods for growth and development. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=611.782s">And</a>  it looks like it's very thorough. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=616.191s">I</a>  appreciate your hard work on this.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=619.493s">Any</a>  other questions from the Council at this time?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=624.916s">Madam</a>  President, I for one don't have a problem with this application at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=628.539s">What</a>  it does is revitalize an underdeveloped parcel. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=630.82s">The</a>  parcel's been vacant for quite some time now. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=632.661s">It's</a>  been somewhat of an eyesore in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=635.263s">Also,</a>  past use was a bank, future use is a bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=639.806s">Putting</a>  a drive-thru teller <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=642.271s">machine</a>  in this location, I don't think it's going to be much of an issue at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=645.694s">It</a>  looks like they have the appropriate lead space to queue cars up, you're not going to back up into the street, and parking and, you know, square footage. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=656.064s">So</a>  I move approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=657.625s">I</a>  second.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=658.306s">What's</a>  up, Councilor Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=663.607s">Thank</a>  you, President Rowe. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=665.007s">Thank</a>  you for the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=665.968s">Just</a>  one question. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=667.188s">You</a>  said that the whole building inside and out will be renovated. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=670.989s">Will</a>  the remainder of the interior space be used as offices for Needham Bank? <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=674.99s">Will</a>  all of the interior space be used for the drive-through? <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=678.571s">I'm</a>  just curious how the rest of the building will be used.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=681.492s">Yeah,</a>  the interior of the building will be upgraded for new and different uses that banks are currently seeing with COVID, with people working, <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=693.178s">remotely</a>  hybrid, so there'll be some workstations. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=697.56s">If</a>  we can allow Ron Coquero on the Zoom call, he's the architect, and he could further answer that question if you think it's necessary.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=709.586s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=709.946s">Sure,</a>  sure, Derek. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=710.707s">I'll</a>  just add a little more information. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=712.448s">So</a>  essentially, the extent of the interior is finishes and cosmetic. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=721.439s">limited</a>  if any changes to the actual structure and the core portion of the building, you know, the bathrooms and infrastructure service points, etc. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=732.104s">At</a>  the end of the day, it was retail, you know, retail bank branch on the first floor, it will be a retail bank branch on the first floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=741.368s">There</a>  were executive support offices on the second floor at the end of the day after the renovations, there will be <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=747.89s">executive</a>  and support offices on the second floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=749.992s">So</a>  that's essentially the extent of the interior. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=754.695s">It's</a>  it's for this for the sake of renovations, cosmetic in nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=762.299s">It's</a>  not. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=763.62s">It's</a>  not structural.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=766.402s">You</a>  could I just have your name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=768.903s">Yes,</a>  it's rock borrow Studio Q architecture.</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1274.464s">I'm</a>  not sure because it's part of a bigger project, but this portion of it, the 495 feet would just be a couple of weeks, I would think. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1284.613s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1291.34s">Thank</a>  you, President Marillyn. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1292.401s">Thank</a>  you for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1293.841s">Just</a>  one question I saw under the conditions that our chief engineer attached to this petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1301.846s">Just</a>  the first one said the recommendation that the grant of location be revised to reflect the accurate location as shown in the plan, just to make sure that the paperwork reflects where the work will actually be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1313.572s">I</a>  just wanted to ask if that revision had been made or if not, <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1318.92s">if</a>  it could be what the process would be for making sure that the location is reflected accurately on the grant of location. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1325.063s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1326.063s">That</a>  correction was made and approved by the city engineer and submitted to.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1337.268s">Any</a>  further questions from the Council Council night, Madam President, I as one member of this body, certainly have no opposition to this project I think that I'm <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1345.512s">you</a>  know, based upon the meetings that we had earlier in the evening, even, we really need to figure out what's going on underground and get that stuff taken care of so that we can take the necessary steps to resurface our roadways into a condition that is suitable and worthy of the taxpayers driving their vehicles on. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1362.441s">Right</a>  now, our roads are in the worst shape around. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1364.562s">Like,</a>  you know, you know when you're entering Medford because it kind of starts shaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1368.104s">So,</a>  you know, with that being said, I think that this project for 195 feet will give us an opportunity to address some underground infrastructure concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1374.995s">I'm</a>  hoping that the city engineer can speak a little bit about whether or not they coordinating any other underground infrastructure projects with the city during this period of time, while the grant location is being offered and the ground is going to be open. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1385.5s">So</a>  maybe the city clerk and the city engineer can speak to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1388.342s">I</a>  know this is Councilor Tseng's backyard, so I'm sure he's got a number of questions to ask about this coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1394.968s">but</a>  ultimately I'm hoping that maybe the city engineer can talk a little bit about our underground infrastructure there, and if the ground's open, whether or not there's a need to do any other work.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1405.894s">Go</a>  ahead.</p>

    <p>[Owen Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1407.315s">Yeah,</a>  hi. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1409.376s">For</a>  this work, we are coordinating with National Grid to do work in our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1416.019s">This</a>  particular location is not one of those things where we're completely coordinating <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1421.86s">with</a>  ever sources work. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1423.721s">Most</a>  of this stuff is going to be in the street, and we will, uh, you know, most of the stuff in the area is with sidewalks and other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1435.329s">But</a>  I know that there will be a sidewalk replacement as well with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1438.091s">So</a>  yes, thank</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1442.161s">Any</a>  additional questions from the Council? <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1444.024s">Vice-Chair</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1444.805s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1446.247s">Thanks,</a>  Diana, for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1449.212s">Does</a>  National Grid plan to come back before the Council regarding the larger Riverside Ave project anytime soon, or is that now on hold?</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1460.103s">If</a>  that's in reference to the one we brought forward a couple of years ago, as far as I know, that's on hold. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1466.867s">We</a>  were requested by MWRA to move our gas main so they could accommodate a restoration project of their water line. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1476.873s">And</a>  I believe that's on hold, so our work isn't necessary at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1481.935s">At</a>  some point, though, you know, we do an evaluation of our <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1489.144s">our</a>  gas lines based on either reliability or integrity. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1492.546s">And</a>  independently of that MWRA project, we may find that it comes up for replacement, but I don't know if that's in the near future or far off at this time.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1506.255s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1508.696s">Yeah,</a>  certainly if it does come back up, coordination would be preferred. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1513.019s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1514.08s">Of</a>  course.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1515.961s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1518.674s">And</a>  if I could just, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1519.655s">Cuddy,</a>  when is work anticipated to begin on this?</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1523.458s">I</a>  think they'd like to start right away because I do believe it is part of a paving program that the city is undertaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1529.242s">So</a>  parts of the project have already been completed and they're just waiting on this last section.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1535.387s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1538.469s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor, oh, sorry, it's public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1542.612s">I</a>  need to open. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1544.546s">So</a>  if we did have the petitioner already spoke, so as this is a public hearing, if anyone would like to speak in favor of this project, please speak up.</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1554.714s">I'm</a>  in favor of this project.</p>

    <p>[Richard Orlando]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1557.336s">My</a>  name is Richard Orlando. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1558.657s">I</a>  live on Winford Way in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1561.019s">This</a>  is more just a point of information and perhaps to the city engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1565.222s">What</a>  performance criteria measurements does the city put on not only this particular contract, <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1572.507s">Contractor</a>  others in terms of just the timing, the schedule, the duration of the project, daily cleanup sweeping of the streets to basically make sure that the area where there are residents that there it minimizes the negative impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1588.273s">So</a>  to the engineer, how are you managing that? <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1591.794s">And</a>  what criteria do you have?</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1593.095s">There</a>  are a number of conditions for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1594.835s">I'm</a>  happy to share my copy with you, but I'll let him speak as well.</p>

    <p>[Owen Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1598.606s">that</a>  they need to speak with you guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1599.787s">Correct</a>  We've set a few conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1601.387s">We</a>  can, um, also include that they need to speak with you guys and make sure that they have, um, erosion and sedimentation controls underway. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1610.352s">Um</a>  we do supervise the projects accordingly when they're doing stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1615.014s">We</a>  said, um, we make sure that, uh, you know, their <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1628.033s">there</a>  are any issues, you know, I hear you, you can always contact my office and we will definitely be out there.</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1636.638s">I'd</a>  also like to add that a job of project of this scope, um, the butters do get notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1643.202s">They</a>  will receive a notice and they were including the supervisor's phone number and the supervisor's name on the notices in case there's questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1651.147s">Um,</a>  they are out there, um, you know, at your, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1656.605s">disposal</a>  to have any questions answered that are specific to the job.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1665.267s">Also,</a>  they're on the agenda itself.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1667.368s">Madam</a>  President, I do think it's also important to point out when you look at the conditions of improvement, the city engineer's office has been able to secure some mitigation for some existing defects in the sidewalks and streets there that aren't necessarily in relation to this project, but are going to get done as part of the project mitigation purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1684.836s">That's</a>  something that I'm happy to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1685.857s">It's</a>  something we've called for in the past, and I'm glad to see that it's making its way into these grants.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1690.4s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1691.581s">Is</a>  there anyone else who would like to speak in favor of the paper? <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1694.384s">I</a>  do see one hand up on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1695.745s">If</a>  you'd like to speak in favor of the paper, name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1703.131s">Hi,</a>  my name is Gay O'Hanasian. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1705.452s">I</a>  had a couple of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1707.294s">My</a>  address is 239 High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1711.117s">I</a>  was wondering, <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1713.186s">if</a>  you could clarify exactly where the beginning end of this payment will be.</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1720.29s">So</a>  for the main replacement on St. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1723.311s">James</a>  Road, it's basically the entire length of the road.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1728.294s">St.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1728.554s">James.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1729.174s">Okay,</a>  great.</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1731.235s">Riverside</a>  Ave to Fellsway, I believe is the far end. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1735.777s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1738.839s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1740.555s">Yeah,</a>  it's great that the paving will be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1743.557s">So</a>  to as Councilors and said to improve the streets of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1749.6s">A</a>  couple other questions do we know and this may not be to you, maybe to engineering or public works. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1757.864s">Are</a>  there any upcoming street openings in that area for the next three years that are known.</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1767.741s">I'll</a>  refer that to Owen, but usually they're coordinating.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1772.002s">To</a>  the engineer, it should... Yes, hi.</p>

    <p>[Owen Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1777.603s">Yes,</a>  there are other areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1779.163s">I</a>  do not know them off the top of my head for the next three years, but if you can reach out to the office, I'll be sure to get those to you, okay?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1787.745s">No,</a>  for this section. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1790.265s">We</a>  don't have any planned just for this section.</p>

    <p>[Owen Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1794.551s">For</a>  St. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1795.011s">James</a>  Road, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1796.793s">We've</a>  coordinated with National Grid for this one section, yes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1800.996s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1801.497s">And</a>  is the scope curb to curb? <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1804.779s">It</a>  was a little hard to understand that because it sounds like there's some sidewalk work that will be done, too, as extra mitigation.</p>

    <p>[Owen Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1814.467s">Diana</a>  should answer this question.</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1817.802s">I,</a>  from my understanding we are replacing this particular piece of gas mean to accommodate the city's paving so regarding the sidewalks I'm not sure, but I would assume the city's either doing centerline to curb or curb to curb but I would. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1835.929s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1839.931s">Okay,</a>  that sounds good so I would be in favor of that.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1844.266s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1845.047s">Does</a>  anyone else would like to speak in favor of the paper? <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1847.308s">Not</a>  seeing any. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1851.431s">Portion</a>  of the public hearing is closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1852.812s">Is</a>  there anyone in opposition of the paper who would like to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1858.477s">Seeing</a>  none, this portion of the public hearing is closed.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1935.529s">So</a>  we can get our questions answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1937.93s">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1943.913s">That</a>  would be more for Owen.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1946.974s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1948.425s">He's</a>  still here. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1949.085s">I'm</a>  not sure if you heard Councilor Caraviello just referring to a previous agenda item in which we asked for a meeting with yourself as well as the public and Eversource. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1959.873s">On</a>  an update on the Eversource project. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1961.374s">I</a>  don't know if you could give us an update on when we might be able to have them come out.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1967.578s">Yeah,</a>  like I said, fortunately, we didn't know about the meeting and we had a meeting already scheduled.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1973.122s">And</a>  I do see there is someone from Eversource on the line at the moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1976.724s">Sorry,</a>  I need to unmute you.</p>

    <p>[Owen Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1979.967s">Yes,</a>  I believe Todd is here from Eversource, and I believe he's ready to speak on that, or maybe it's Tim.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1988.832s">Madam</a>  President, with all due respect, this is a pretty big issue we've been talking about for quite a bit of time, but I had no idea that they were coming tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1995.276s">I</a>  don't know if anybody else had any awareness whether or not they were coming this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1998.138s">Oh,</a>  they're here tonight to talk about it? <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1999.539s">Apparently,</a>  that's what the city engineer just mentioned.</p>

    <p>[Owen Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2002.601s">Yeah,</a>  we were asked to come last week, and I believe it was continued to this week.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2011.242s">Unfortunately,</a>  we were not informed that we were going to be talking about this tonight.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2019.067s">We</a>  did. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2020.108s">Yeah,</a>  we did move it to unfinished business last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2023.51s">So</a>  they could come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2024.371s">So</a>  the paper is on the table, but I understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2026.752s">So</a>  I mean, yeah, we can get an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2030.635s">Yeah,</a>  we can get an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2031.655s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2032.636s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2033.476s">Yeah,</a>  I think we can get an update at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2037.423s">Do</a>  you have a word or the rules are suspended? <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2039.466s">Does</a>  anyone want to take that from the table?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2042.55s">Motion</a>  to take paper 22-something 361 off the table.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2053.748s">The</a>  motion of items and bears to take paper 22-361 off the table, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2059.369s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2060.33s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2061.91s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2063.29s">So</a>  Todd Lanham, if you could give us an update, a general update on where the Eversource project stands. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2070.212s">I</a>  do think there is a need for a future meeting that is more early, more lead time to notice this so people can attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2079.014s">But</a>  I think we've been waiting for this update for a very long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2082.611s">speak</a>  to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2083.211s">I</a>  will unmute you.</p>

    <p>[Bill Forte]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2085.692s">Perfect.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2086.052s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2086.312s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2087.053s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2087.313s">Todd</a>  Lanham here with Eversource. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2090.314s">Just</a>  for the record, office address is 247 Station Drive in Westwood, and I do have a very brief update, a very brief subset of a presentation that we actually gave to residents last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2103.598s">I'm</a>  happy to share that if I may. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2105.139s">Would</a>  that please the council?</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2109.03s">Are</a>  you able to share your screen? <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2110.911s">Or</a>  could you please make him a co-host, Mr. Clerk?</p>

    <p>[Bill Forte]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2115.394s">It's</a>  very short. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2116.555s">And</a>  again, more than happy to come back and do this in a more in-depth forum if you'd like. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2122.138s">But</a>  I thought at least for this forum, five short slides, a little brief narrative about where we are.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2128.442s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Lanham. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2131.845s">You</a>  should be able to share your screen now if you'd like to try.</p>

    <p>[Bill Forte]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2134.566s">Let's</a>  see if we can do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2137.945s">Are</a>  you seeing my title slide now?</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2140.226s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bill Forte]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2140.386s">All</a>  right, perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2141.887s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2142.228s">So</a>  once again, Todd Lanham with Eversource. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2144.429s">I</a>  am here tonight just to give you a very brief presentation on where we are with this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2150.292s">I'm</a>  gonna go through five slides relatively quickly, certainly be able to take some questions and answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2155.475s">If</a>  we have any, I'll do my best to answer any questions that you may have, or as we've discussed, if you would like, be happy to come out and give a more detailed conversation to members of the council if you'd like.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2171.152s">please</a>  proceed.</p>

    <p>[Bill Forte]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2172.972s">I'm</a>  trying to, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2175.093s">Forward.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2175.373s">There</a>  we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2175.973s">So</a>  just to re ground everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2178.394s">I</a>  think we all know about the segment of construction that goes through Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2183.715s">What</a>  you see on the screen here is represented of the conduit or the pipe and green and red and in the boxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2191.937s">Those</a>  represent the nine manholes that we <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2201.369s">on</a>  the pipe that's in Medford represents sections that have been installed. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2206.511s">The</a>  red sections in Medford are the ones that remain. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2211.252s">Out</a>  of the approximately 3.2 miles of pipe that we have had to install in Medford, approximately 2.7 miles of that has been completed, or roughly 87%. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2225.496s">We</a>  have about 2,200 feet left to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2233.545s">So</a>  where are we working currently? <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2235.306s">What</a>  this slide tells you kind of goes through some of the segments that we have been working on. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2242.249s">You</a>  can see some of the completed segments. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2245.27s">We're</a>  actively working in the locations where you currently see the blue. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2249.993s">So</a>  that's from Mystic Valley Parkway to High Street, and then also South Street to Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2257.096s">Those</a>  are the two sections where we currently have crews during the daytime, <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2261.993s">for</a>  mystic Valley Parkway and then we have nine crews working on the South Street and Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2268.097s">The</a>  other sections that are in black represent some projected completion dates or activity dates, given all the activities that you heard about the coordination between a lot of different competing interests, as you heard tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2284.395s">other</a>  providers have activities going on in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2286.776s">So</a>  these dates are somewhat flexible, but we try to give you an idea about when we think construction may commence and when it may complete. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2297.44s">But</a>  again, the two in blue are the ones I wanted to focus on tonight is that's where we have active construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2306.244s">So</a>  to talk about one of the work zones here between Mystic Valley Parkway and High Street, you see, if you can see on my screen, <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2313.65s">This</a>  is one section where we're currently actively working. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2317.892s">The</a>  forecast right now is to complete this section sometime later this summer, early fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2324.134s">And</a>  from there, we will go to the second segment here between High Street and Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2334.377s">These</a>  are both in the same section. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2336.938s">Roughly</a>  speaking, we just broke them down into two individual pieces to make it a little more <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2342.897s">easy</a>  to understand, but this work right here will probably last through the end of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2351.699s">There's</a>  also the section that we talked about from South Street to Main Street that we're currently working on. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2356.82s">You</a>  can see here both the graphic and the forecasted schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2362.262s">As</a>  we continue to work with engineering, DBW staff, public safety, we continue to try to optimize the schedules to do more work more efficiently. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2372.747s">more</a>  timely, but this gives you a rough idea about this section of work right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2378.169s">It's</a>  a very complicated corner, as it were, where we're trying to install the pipe currently. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2388.173s">That</a>  was very, very brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2390.654s">I</a>  will say this, this is, again, this is a very small subset of the entire presentation that we did earlier this week with the community group. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2400.973s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2401.493s">Oh,</a>  and if you have anything else to add, or I'm certainly happy to try and answer any questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2407.895s">If</a>  you have any, but I hope that gave you at least a little bit of, of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2413.537s">As</a>  far as where we're actively working, and at least some interim projections there.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2420.178s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2421.119s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2430.054s">Are</a>  you going to be doing any more digging on Mystic Avenue?</p>

    <p>[Bill Forte]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2433.796s">We're</a>  going to be doing any more digging on Mystic Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2436.438s">I</a>  believe the answer to that question, I'm waiting for some of my engineering friends that are on with me tonight to confirm. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2444.923s">We</a>  are not going to be doing any more digging on Mystic Avenue, as I understand.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2449.865s">So</a>  is there a reason, would it be possible to start grinding and paving at least Mystic Avenue? <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2458.225s">In</a>  the meantime, seeing that you're not doing any work there during the summer before the winter comes. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2466.389s">Because</a>  you're gonna be replacing the road.</p>

    <p>[Bill Forte]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2471.932s">That</a>  is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2473.033s">Let</a>  me, again, I'm trying, I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2475.114s">I'm</a>  trying to stop sharing my screen so I can get back to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2479.236s">So</a>  let me just stop this here. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2480.997s">Oh,</a>  I did the wrong thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2486.759s">I</a>  apologize here. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2491.935s">So</a>  I guess the question is, when are we going to be able to pave the Mystic Valley Parkway? <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2496.396s">Is</a>  that the correct answer? <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2498.697s">Mr.</a>  Gabb.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2500.097s">I</a>  mean, if that part has already been, is already complete, you're not going to be doing any more digging there. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2507.38s">Why</a>  can't you at least get that paved at least up to Soul Street in the interest of, you know, before the end of the summer or before the winter time comes?</p>

    <p>[Bill Forte]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2521.699s">Sorry,</a>  I'm waiting for one of my engineers that are here with me on the call. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2525.782s">I'm</a>  waiting for them to help help me out with that answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2528.603s">So</a>  if you'll bear with me one second. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2530.445s">I</a>  do believe we have some sections of restoration prepared for later this summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2537.149s">Again,</a>  I think it's a function of making sure that we optimize the schedule working collaboratively with the DPW and the staff to make sure that <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2546.17s">Everybody</a>  that has work in and around the streets can complete it before we do the paving but right now I do think later this summer, and oh and correct me if I'm wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2556.312s">I</a>  think we're looking at later this year to try and get some of that repaving done.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2561.713s">And</a>  as I do agree that you know we shouldn't be paving, especially if we know we're going to be if there's going to be other utilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2568.98s">going</a>  in there, but I'd like to see at least down to the police station done before you make the turn going on the South Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2576.828s">Because</a>  again, that's the Mr. Gaff pad has been done for a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2581.513s">So</a>  again, that would be great if you could at least get Mr. Gavin you done. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2585.517s">And</a>  then we can move forward too.</p>

    <p>[Bill Forte]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2590.853s">I'm</a>  sorry, I will tell you this we do have a weekly meeting with the engineering staff and the DPW staff, I will make sure that we bring this up with our weekly meeting to to talk about those desires, and again, provided all of the competing interest we can get in there and get all of the activity on that we need to do and the other utilities, and the city projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2614.61s">Perhaps</a>  we can try to get that page sooner as opposed to later I'm sorry, I think I'm talking over you.</p>

    <p>[Owen Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2620.777s">And</a>  yeah, I couldn't get unmuted here. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2623.279s">So</a>  basically, I believe that the for this year, they are going to focus on Winthrop Street, instead of mystic, Mystic Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2635.518s">and</a>  we're trying to time those up with some of the subdivisions and the other work that is going on in the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2642.463s">At</a>  least that's the upper portion of Winthrop Street to get it milled. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2647.266s">I</a>  believe the things that still need to happen in Mystic Ave is some of the pipe proofing and vacuum testing along with the whole corridor. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2657.814s">So</a>  there's, those are the things that are kind of <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2662.537s">holding</a>  up the milling and the paving as of this moment, as of currently, they need to go through that testing process before they can mill and overlay.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2673.602s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2674.262s">And</a>  do you have some kind of a completion date for this project?</p>

    <p>[Bill Forte]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2684.466s">Again,</a>  I think not wanting to over commit and then under deliver, we are working <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2691.383s">diligently</a>  to try and complete all the work or as much of the work as we can during this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2696.946s">A</a>  lot of factors that go into that construction has been rather challenging. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2702.269s">I</a>  know we've been out here for a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2704.771s">But</a>  again, I think the collaboration with the staff and public safety to make sure that we are working in a safe and efficient manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2714.377s">I</a>  think that's what we're trying to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2715.837s">So</a>  I don't again, <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2717.334s">I'm</a>  hesitant to give you a date, but just know that the intent is for us to wrap this up as quickly as possible and complete the restoration as quickly and safely as we possibly can. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2731.683s">Owen,</a>  I don't know if you have anything that you'd like to add on that.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2735.845s">Hopefully</a>  construction will be done by the end of this year, and hopefully maybe next year you can start paving all the streets that have been dug up. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2745.491s">Is</a>  that a good assumption?</p>

    <p>[Bill Forte]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2747.222s">I</a>  think that's a good I think that's what we're working towards again. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2750.404s">Oh,</a>  and I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2751.605s">I</a>  feel like I'm talking over you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2753.006s">But</a>  I think that's what staff and and ever source are working collaboratively on is to try to make sure that we finish up as quickly as we can, utilizing as many of the resources that the town and the staff can can provide, and just make sure that this work is completed quickly and safely.</p>

    <p>[Owen Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2775.452s">Yeah,</a>  also I'd like to add that the city's working collaboratively with Eversource to try to get more crews and details for them so that they can expedite this work during this season. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2789.22s">We</a>  know that this has gone on a long time and we are very, we're working with them diligently to make sure that this project gets wrapped up.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2806.161s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2809.002s">Councilor</a>  Cabrera, I'll ask all my questions, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2811.783s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2812.684s">Madam</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2814.445s">I</a>  had the opportunity to go through some of the files that weren't stolen from my desk by one of the members of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2820.347s">And</a>  what I found was a document dated 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2824.149s">And</a>  this document was on May 19th, 2015, which is our initial introduction to the Ebersole Statistic to Woburn Pipeline Project. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2834.93s">At</a>  that time, we had some discussions where they said that this was gonna go to the Department of Public Utilities and then construction was gonna start in 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2843.995s">In</a>  2017, I'm sorry, 2017 we met and this was pushed out to 2018 to start construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2854.2s">The</a>  construction said it was gonna be nine vaults. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2857.802s">As</a>  of our last meeting, February 4th, 2020, five of the nine vaults were completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2864.913s">As</a>  we go through our old files and paperwork that we see here, it says Eversource is going to provide us with weekly updates via email. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2873.357s">There'd</a>  be a Medford-specific website and Medford-specific community events and meetings surrounding this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2877.919s">We</a>  haven't seen any of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2878.74s">I</a>  don't know how many requests we've made to get the curb stones removed from the front of Victory Park that have been sitting there for two and a half years. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2886.044s">You</a>  know, just small quality of life things. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2887.704s">We</a>  know it's going to take a while to get the construction done, but don't leave the place looking like a dump for five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2892.936s">five,</a>  actually seven, seven years now for seven years. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2895.498s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2895.798s">So</a>  I don't know how long it took them to build that tunnel in Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2897.94s">I</a>  think it was 14. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2898.3s">We're</a>  almost halfway there. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2899.922s">I</a>  mean, this is like the credit bridge part two. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2901.983s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2902.604s">We</a>  got to get this thing done. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2904.725s">Now</a>  a quick question is the pipeline project portion in the city of Somerville complete?</p>

    <p>[Bill Forte]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2917.035s">I</a>  don't believe it is, but let, again, let me, sorry, I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2921.923s">polling</a>  my colleagues No, I don't believe that portion and some of those complete yet either.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2929.848s">Is</a>  the pipeline project portion in Winchester complete.</p>

    <p>[Bill Forte]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2936.912s">No,</a>  it is not.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2939.094s">Is</a>  the pipeline portion in Woburn.</p>

    <p>[Bill Forte]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2952.895s">On</a>  the Woburn side, I do know that there was work that has been completed inside the substation. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2960.138s">But</a>  as far as the street work, I don't believe that that has been completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2964.2s">Just</a>  the work inside the substation has been completed.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2968.661s">2015</a>  was a long time ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2974.284s">And</a>  this still isn't done. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2975.664s">I</a>  mean, there has to be some accountability. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2979.379s">What</a>  are the contributing factors to this taking so long? <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2982.361s">Is</a>  it that we don't have the crews to do the work? <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2985.303s">Is</a>  it that it had to be rebid? <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2986.684s">I</a>  think it had to be rebid at one point in time, if I'm not mistaken. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2990.647s">But</a>  is it that we can't get police details to be out there? <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2993.49s">Is</a>  the city administration saying we can't run crews? <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2996.612s">What's</a>  the holdup on the construction?</p>

    <p>[Bill Forte]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2999.774s">I</a>  think it's been a myriad of factors. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=3002.056s">A</a>  lot of uncharted utilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=3004.338s">We</a>  ran into a lot of unexpected encumbrances. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=3007.638s">We</a>  did rebid the project at one point in times. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=3012.819s">I</a>  do think you have a lot of valid questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=3015.48s">I</a>  would be more than happy rather than take up the time for the council hearing tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=3021.941s">I'd</a>  be more than happy to schedule some time to come talk to the council individually and have a more detailed conversation in person if that would please the council.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=3033.676s">I</a>  mean, we've had enough of these meetings in the past where I don't think anything's going to please us other than the job being done and everybody being out of here. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=3040.96s">The</a>  residents of Winthrop Street now, since I've been on the council with my ninth year, we've done the Winthrop Street Rotary project that closed that area down for a year and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=3051.285s">Then</a>  they did three years of the Craddock Bridge, which destroyed traffic right through the Winthrop Street Rotary. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=3056.107s">And</a>  then we started the Ebersource project. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=3058.048s">All</a>  right, so for the past decade, this area has been just decimated. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=3062.695s">with</a>  traffic detours traffic management plans and underground construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=3065.958s">So</a>  it needs to get done and I don't fault you sir I know this isn't your fault and all this is a gigantic regional multi billion dollar project that you guys are trying to get done, but we have to understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=3077.228s">I</a>  think we should take you up on your offer I think that this is something that could go into, you know, a little bit more detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=3083.29s">You</a>  know, as I pull out some more files and notes, I'm gonna have more questions and I got enough of them in here in front of me to make this go on forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=3090.731s">So</a>  I'm gonna rest my case and I'm gonna take the gentleman up on his offer and make a request that this paper be referred to a committee of the whole for future date.</p>
