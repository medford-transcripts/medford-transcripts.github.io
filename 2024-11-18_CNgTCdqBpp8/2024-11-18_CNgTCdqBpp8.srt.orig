20
00:02:17,127 --> 00:02:18,468
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to

[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Derek Redgate.

[SPEAKER_07]: I work, I'm a civil engineer with High Point Engineering representing Needham Bank who is here with us tonight as well for any questions that you may have.

23
00:02:30,543 --> 00:02:33,806
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like your permission and maybe your recommendation.

24
00:02:33,866 --> 00:02:37,850
[SPEAKER_07]: I have, I have some graphical handouts that I'd like to hand out.

00:02:39,091 --> 00:02:40,333
[SPEAKER_07]: You will pass them around.

27
00:02:46,843 --> 00:03:01,909
[SPEAKER_07]: And then for the audience at home, in the video, I have a tripod with some graphics as well, which I can set up anywhere you think is the best viewing spot, whether it's inside or just outside.

28
00:03:03,369 --> 00:03:03,910
[SPEAKER_07]: Right in front of me.

29
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:04,710
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

30
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:10,812
[SPEAKER_08]: Just wanna pass it over.

31
00:03:38,897 --> 00:03:50,939
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.

32
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:57,041
[SPEAKER_14]: Shane, can you turn the camera?

33
00:03:57,581 --> 00:03:58,201
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, Shane.

34
00:03:59,401 --> 00:04:00,381
[SPEAKER_14]: Shane, can you hear me?

35
00:04:01,221 --> 00:04:01,461
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

36
00:04:01,481 --> 00:04:02,762
[SPEAKER_14]: A little out of it?

37
00:04:02,782 --> 00:04:03,122
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

38
00:04:03,162 --> 00:04:03,502
[SPEAKER_11]: He's okay.

39
00:04:03,522 --> 00:04:03,822
[SPEAKER_14]: He's turning.

40
00:04:10,593 --> 00:04:15,575
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we'll build the Taj Mahal as a drafter.

41
00:04:19,776 --> 00:04:19,956
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

42
00:04:20,496 --> 00:04:21,817
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, my name is Derek Redgate.

43
00:04:22,217 --> 00:04:24,858
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm with High Point Engineering in Dedham.

44
00:04:25,078 --> 00:04:25,958
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a civil engineer.

45
00:04:26,818 --> 00:04:37,822
[SPEAKER_07]: Also with me tonight is representatives of Needham Bank, including Jim White, who is the Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer.

46
00:04:39,197 --> 00:04:43,480
[SPEAKER_07]: And then also on Zoom is the architect for the project, Ron Cocaro.

47
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,304
[SPEAKER_07]: So if there's any questions related to the architecture, he's available via Zoom.

48
00:04:49,765 --> 00:04:52,907
[SPEAKER_07]: We're here for a special permit under section 11.6.

49
00:04:55,789 --> 00:05:02,194
[SPEAKER_07]: The project's located at 270 Mystic Avenue, the intersection of Mystic Ave and Mystic Valley Parkway.

50
00:05:03,451 --> 00:05:07,856
[SPEAKER_07]: It's currently a brick office building, two stories.

51
00:05:08,676 --> 00:05:13,121
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about 10,300 square feet, and it's currently vacant.

52
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:20,067
[SPEAKER_07]: It's on a 26,000 square foot lot, which is a little bit more than a half an acre.

53
00:05:21,769 --> 00:05:24,211
[SPEAKER_07]: The parcel is located in Zoning District C2.

54
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:37,362
[SPEAKER_07]: And under the chart for uses, drive-through uses are an allowed use with a special permit from City Council.

55
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:40,363
[SPEAKER_07]: So that is why we're here tonight.

56
00:05:42,484 --> 00:05:44,344
[SPEAKER_07]: Other than that, this is a by-right project.

57
00:05:45,784 --> 00:05:50,885
[SPEAKER_07]: We won't be seeking any more relief from other boards.

58
00:05:51,025 --> 00:05:53,166
[SPEAKER_07]: It's strictly the,

59
00:05:55,425 --> 00:05:58,426
[SPEAKER_07]: relief for a drive-through in the C2.

60
00:06:02,107 --> 00:06:05,548
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, it's a 10,300 square foot brick building.

61
00:06:05,568 --> 00:06:17,711
[SPEAKER_07]: It currently has 30 parking spaces and our use will be operating under the same parking demand and we'll be able to maintain the required 30 spaces.

62
00:06:20,152 --> 00:06:24,473
[SPEAKER_07]: There's gonna be a full renovation of the brick building.

63
00:06:27,488 --> 00:06:38,952
[SPEAKER_07]: renovation on the interior, facade renovations, which I have some graphics and are part of the handout that I gave you some renderings of that.

64
00:06:40,213 --> 00:06:48,676
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'd like to locate an ATM machine, but also a full service window.

65
00:06:49,637 --> 00:06:52,598
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you look at, I'm trying to,

66
00:06:53,154 --> 00:07:07,673
[SPEAKER_07]: look at the plans and I can show you where it is, but it's towards the back right corner of the graphic, which we felt was the most appropriate location for the ATM and the driver.

67
00:07:12,994 --> 00:07:13,174
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

68
00:07:13,234 --> 00:07:25,327
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think it's important though to have someone from Needham Bank also sort of talk about the history in the city with another branch and new employees and things like that.

69
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:29,401
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Madam President.

70
00:07:30,021 --> 00:07:31,042
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for your presentation.

71
00:07:31,662 --> 00:07:38,728
[SPEAKER_16]: I think most of us are familiar with that building and I think it is more than enough room there to accomplish what you want.

72
00:07:39,528 --> 00:07:46,854
[SPEAKER_16]: I think this will be maybe a start of the upgrading of mystic Avenue with this building.

73
00:07:49,531 --> 00:08:06,517
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, if you showed the picture where you're gonna be redoing the whole property and making it, upgrading the look of it, this might be a small shot in the arm for the avenue that needs maybe to get some other people interested in the surrounding property around it.

74
00:08:06,557 --> 00:08:15,980
[SPEAKER_16]: So again, the last time I think I did a survey, someone else was looking for a drive-thru window some years ago.

75
00:08:18,813 --> 00:08:22,395
[SPEAKER_16]: is really not a major backup of cars, I don't think.

76
00:08:22,415 --> 00:08:31,198
[SPEAKER_16]: And I've talked to the other ones, I don't think, 50, 60 a day, 70 a day, that's on the big end, and they won't all be queuing at the same time.

77
00:08:31,218 --> 00:08:32,919
[SPEAKER_16]: But I think you get more than that from there.

78
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,220
[SPEAKER_16]: You'll be upgrading the look of the building.

79
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:39,662
[SPEAKER_16]: It'll maybe give the avenue a little bit of a shot in the eye too.

80
00:08:39,922 --> 00:08:41,043
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, we agree, thank you.

81
00:08:41,543 --> 00:08:42,403
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Carvalho.

82
00:08:42,423 --> 00:08:43,083
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli.

83
00:08:43,784 --> 00:08:44,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Madam President.

84
00:08:44,684 --> 00:08:46,585
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, thank you for the presentation.

85
00:08:47,476 --> 00:09:10,429
[SPEAKER_05]: What's glaring right now is that what we have there, what's existing there, and prior to the past location, it was a huge public safety issue because as Mystic Ave backed up, people would fly through the Bank of America parking lot, just cut over onto the sidewalk right in front.

86
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:14,511
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like you're putting a landscape, and is that a fence right to the corner?

87
00:09:15,558 --> 00:09:20,021
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we're aware of the opportunity.

88
00:09:22,403 --> 00:09:24,365
[SPEAKER_07]: We're gonna sign it appropriately.

89
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:29,789
[SPEAKER_07]: We're hoping to sign it where you can only enter through Mystic Avenue.

90
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:39,456
[SPEAKER_07]: And there is some traffic calming devices that are there right now in place.

91
00:09:39,636 --> 00:09:42,538
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we would try to copy them in kind.

92
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:44,820
[SPEAKER_07]: But we will also look at

93
00:09:45,896 --> 00:09:49,717
[SPEAKER_07]: look at that issue when we go to a final design of the site.

94
00:09:50,717 --> 00:09:53,058
[SPEAKER_07]: The bank would not want people cutting through.

95
00:09:53,158 --> 00:09:53,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, we know that.

96
00:09:53,758 --> 00:09:56,058
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why I would support.

97
00:09:56,098 --> 00:09:59,299
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that the update looks beautiful.

98
00:09:59,359 --> 00:10:11,082
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that, like Councilor Caviello says, this should be a gateway to our, probably one of our most intriguing neighborhoods for growth and development.

99
00:10:11,782 --> 00:10:14,963
[SPEAKER_05]: And it looks like it's very thorough.

100
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:19,393
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate your hard work on this.

101
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:22,435
[SPEAKER_14]: Any other questions from the Council at this time?

102
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:28,259
[SPEAKER_20]: Madam President, I for one don't have a problem with this application at all.

103
00:10:28,539 --> 00:10:30,780
[SPEAKER_20]: What it does is revitalize an underdeveloped parcel.

104
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,581
[SPEAKER_20]: The parcel's been vacant for quite some time now.

105
00:10:32,661 --> 00:10:35,183
[SPEAKER_20]: It's been somewhat of an eyesore in the neighborhood.

106
00:10:35,263 --> 00:10:39,045
[SPEAKER_20]: Also, past use was a bank, future use is a bank.

107
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:40,926
[SPEAKER_20]: Putting a drive-thru teller

108
00:10:42,271 --> 00:10:45,294
[SPEAKER_20]: machine in this location, I don't think it's going to be much of an issue at all.

109
00:10:45,694 --> 00:10:55,983
[SPEAKER_20]: It looks like they have the appropriate lead space to queue cars up, you're not going to back up into the street, and parking and, you know, square footage.

110
00:10:56,064 --> 00:10:57,064
[SPEAKER_20]: So I move approval.

111
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:57,985
[SPEAKER_20]: I second.

112
00:10:58,306 --> 00:11:01,208
[SPEAKER_14]: What's up, Councilor Collins.

113
00:11:03,607 --> 00:11:04,347
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, President Rowe.

114
00:11:05,007 --> 00:11:05,928
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for the presentation.

115
00:11:05,968 --> 00:11:07,148
[SPEAKER_15]: Just one question.

116
00:11:07,188 --> 00:11:09,749
[SPEAKER_15]: You said that the whole building inside and out will be renovated.

117
00:11:10,989 --> 00:11:14,950
[SPEAKER_15]: Will the remainder of the interior space be used as offices for Needham Bank?

118
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:18,551
[SPEAKER_15]: Will all of the interior space be used for the drive-through?

119
00:11:18,571 --> 00:11:20,172
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just curious how the rest of the building will be used.

120
00:11:21,492 --> 00:11:32,375
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the interior of the building will be upgraded for new and different uses that banks are currently seeing with COVID, with people working,

121
00:11:33,178 --> 00:11:35,639
[SPEAKER_07]: remotely hybrid, so there'll be some workstations.

122
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:48,286
[SPEAKER_07]: If we can allow Ron Coquero on the Zoom call, he's the architect, and he could further answer that question if you think it's necessary.

123
00:11:49,586 --> 00:11:49,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

124
00:11:49,946 --> 00:11:50,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, sure, Derek.

125
00:11:50,707 --> 00:11:52,388
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just add a little more information.

126
00:11:52,448 --> 00:12:00,532
[SPEAKER_02]: So essentially, the extent of the interior is finishes and cosmetic.

127
00:12:01,439 --> 00:12:10,803
[SPEAKER_02]: limited if any changes to the actual structure and the core portion of the building, you know, the bathrooms and infrastructure service points, etc.

128
00:12:12,104 --> 00:12:20,287
[SPEAKER_02]: At the end of the day, it was retail, you know, retail bank branch on the first floor, it will be a retail bank branch on the first floor.

129
00:12:21,368 --> 00:12:26,390
[SPEAKER_02]: There were executive support offices on the second floor at the end of the day after the renovations, there will be

130
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,972
[SPEAKER_02]: executive and support offices on the second floor.

131
00:12:29,992 --> 00:12:33,434
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's essentially the extent of the interior.

132
00:12:34,695 --> 00:12:41,999
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's for this for the sake of renovations, cosmetic in nature.

133
00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:42,679
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not.

134
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,340
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not structural.

135
00:12:46,402 --> 00:12:48,243
[SPEAKER_14]: You could I just have your name and address for the record, please.

136
00:12:48,903 --> 00:12:51,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it's rock borrow Studio Q architecture.

137
00:12:52,723 --> 00:12:53,063
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

138
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:54,965
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is a public hearing.

139
00:12:54,985 --> 00:12:57,607
[SPEAKER_14]: We do have to conduct it in a certain way before I open a public hearing.

140
00:12:57,867 --> 00:13:02,150
[SPEAKER_14]: If someone from Median Bank did want to speak as you referenced, just to talk about this project.

141
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:11,938
[SPEAKER_14]: Name and address for the record, please.

143
00:13:18,847 --> 00:13:38,781

146
00:13:47,936 --> 00:13:50,617
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there anyone who would like to speak in favor of the paper?

147
00:13:50,637 --> 00:13:55,418

00:13:59,119 --> 00:13:59,919
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just a public hearing.

149
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:01,059
[SPEAKER_14]: We have to go through it procedurally.

150
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:03,479

151
00:14:03,499 --> 00:14:06,160

[SPEAKER_14]: So we're gonna defer to National Grid, I believe.

311
00:18:38,078 --> 00:18:40,360
[SPEAKER_14]: We have Diana Cuddy on the line.

312
00:18:41,464 --> 00:18:44,347
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, good evening Madam Mayor City Council.

313
00:18:44,387 --> 00:18:59,820
[SPEAKER_13]: My name is Diana Cuddy I'm with national grid 40 Sylvan road wall in Massachusetts, and we're here before you would have a main replacement project in the streets that were just mentioned, but we just need a grant of location for the portion in St.

314
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:07,847
[SPEAKER_13]: James road, because it is going outside of the original grand location, more than three feet away from the existing pipe.

315
00:19:09,552 --> 00:19:14,974
[SPEAKER_13]: Our proposal is to install 495 feet of six-inch plastic gas main in St.

316
00:19:15,014 --> 00:19:15,634
[SPEAKER_13]: James Road.

317
00:19:18,835 --> 00:19:19,215
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Ms.

318
00:19:19,255 --> 00:19:19,516
[SPEAKER_14]: Cuddy.

319
00:19:22,717 --> 00:19:24,157
[SPEAKER_14]: What's the length of the project?

320
00:19:25,138 --> 00:19:26,098
[SPEAKER_13]: For this portion of St.

321
00:19:26,138 --> 00:19:27,618
[SPEAKER_13]: James, it's 495 feet.

322
00:19:29,379 --> 00:19:29,699
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry?

323
00:19:30,459 --> 00:19:31,640
[SPEAKER_13]: For the portion in St.

324
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:35,821
[SPEAKER_13]: James Road, it's for the grand location, it's 495 feet of six-inch plastic pipe.

325
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:36,282
[SPEAKER_13]: 495 feet?

326
00:19:36,822 --> 00:19:37,362
[SPEAKER_13]: Correct, yes.

327
00:19:41,078 --> 00:19:49,082
[SPEAKER_20]: Is there any questions from the council at this time Council night, Miss Connie welcome back I know last time you were here wasn't the most pleasant experience for you and apologize for that.

328
00:19:49,842 --> 00:20:07,530
[SPEAKER_13]: Is this project, have any relation with the mother Riverside Avenue project that was on you here before us on previously, it does not that was with regards to MWR a asking us this is actually a project that we moved up, I believe to accommodate city paving in the area.

329
00:20:10,957 --> 00:20:13,159
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, excellent.

330
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:18,885
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli.

331
00:20:20,527 --> 00:20:22,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, thank you for being here this evening.

332
00:20:22,869 --> 00:20:29,977
[SPEAKER_05]: My question is, are we, has there been issues about working on Saturdays here in Medford?

333
00:20:32,032 --> 00:20:34,015
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, as far I don't know the answer to that.

334
00:20:34,195 --> 00:20:42,965
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, it's certainly something that can be put into the permit if there is an issue or it's preferable or at night, those kind of things can go into the permit.

335
00:20:44,367 --> 00:20:47,010
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't heard of any issues on set with Saturday work though.

336
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:50,554
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so this job will be done mostly when then, you know,

337
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:57,787
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, typically yeah, Monday through Friday, but they, I know they do this work.

338
00:20:57,987 --> 00:21:01,331
[SPEAKER_13]: This type of job is done by a contracted contractor.

339
00:21:01,351 --> 00:21:08,078
[SPEAKER_13]: So, um, you know, it can be done during the evening on Saturdays.

340
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,603
[SPEAKER_05]: How long is estimated time?

341
00:21:12,623 --> 00:21:12,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know?

342
00:21:14,464 --> 00:21:24,052
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not sure because it's part of a bigger project, but this portion of it, the 495 feet would just be a couple of weeks, I would think.

343
00:21:24,613 --> 00:21:27,575
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

344
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,321
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, President Marillyn.

345
00:21:32,401 --> 00:21:33,201
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for being here.

346
00:21:33,841 --> 00:21:40,965
[SPEAKER_15]: Just one question I saw under the conditions that our chief engineer attached to this petition.

347
00:21:41,846 --> 00:21:53,532
[SPEAKER_15]: Just the first one said the recommendation that the grant of location be revised to reflect the accurate location as shown in the plan, just to make sure that the paperwork reflects where the work will actually be done.

348
00:21:53,572 --> 00:21:57,615
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to ask if that revision had been made or if not,

349
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:04,983
[SPEAKER_15]: if it could be what the process would be for making sure that the location is reflected accurately on the grant of location.

350
00:22:05,063 --> 00:22:05,383
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

351
00:22:06,063 --> 00:22:13,487
[SPEAKER_13]: That correction was made and approved by the city engineer and submitted to.

352
00:22:17,268 --> 00:22:24,832
[SPEAKER_20]: Any further questions from the Council Council night, Madam President, I as one member of this body, certainly have no opposition to this project I think that I'm

353
00:22:25,512 --> 00:22:41,940
[SPEAKER_20]: you know, based upon the meetings that we had earlier in the evening, even, we really need to figure out what's going on underground and get that stuff taken care of so that we can take the necessary steps to resurface our roadways into a condition that is suitable and worthy of the taxpayers driving their vehicles on.

354
00:22:42,441 --> 00:22:44,102
[SPEAKER_20]: Right now, our roads are in the worst shape around.

355
00:22:44,562 --> 00:22:47,263
[SPEAKER_20]: Like, you know, you know when you're entering Medford because it kind of starts shaking.

356
00:22:48,104 --> 00:22:54,667
[SPEAKER_20]: So, you know, with that being said, I think that this project for 195 feet will give us an opportunity to address some underground infrastructure concerns.

357
00:22:54,995 --> 00:23:05,100
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm hoping that the city engineer can speak a little bit about whether or not they coordinating any other underground infrastructure projects with the city during this period of time, while the grant location is being offered and the ground is going to be open.

358
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,982
[SPEAKER_20]: So maybe the city clerk and the city engineer can speak to that.

359
00:23:08,342 --> 00:23:14,285
[SPEAKER_20]: I know this is Councillor Singh's backyard, so I'm sure he's got a number of questions to ask about this coming up.

360
00:23:14,968 --> 00:23:25,033
[SPEAKER_20]: but ultimately I'm hoping that maybe the city engineer can talk a little bit about our underground infrastructure there, and if the ground's open, whether or not there's a need to do any other work.

361
00:23:25,894 --> 00:23:26,194
[SPEAKER_14]: Go ahead.

362
00:23:27,315 --> 00:23:28,695
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, hi.

363
00:23:29,376 --> 00:23:35,199
[SPEAKER_06]: For this work, we are coordinating with National Grid to do work in our streets.

364
00:23:36,019 --> 00:23:41,302
[SPEAKER_06]: This particular location is not one of those things where we're completely coordinating

365
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,381
[SPEAKER_06]: with ever sources work.

366
00:23:43,721 --> 00:23:53,868
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of this stuff is going to be in the street, and we will, uh, you know, most of the stuff in the area is with sidewalks and other things.

367
00:23:55,329 --> 00:23:58,011
[SPEAKER_06]: But I know that there will be a sidewalk replacement as well with us.

368
00:23:58,091 --> 00:23:59,712
[SPEAKER_06]: So yes, thank

369
00:24:02,161 --> 00:24:03,964
[SPEAKER_14]: Any additional questions from the Council?

370
00:24:04,024 --> 00:24:04,705
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice-Chair Behrs.

371
00:24:04,805 --> 00:24:05,787
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Madam President.

372
00:24:06,247 --> 00:24:08,190
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks, Diana, for being here.

373
00:24:09,212 --> 00:24:17,925
[SPEAKER_19]: Does National Grid plan to come back before the Council regarding the larger Riverside Ave project anytime soon, or is that now on hold?

374
00:24:20,103 --> 00:24:26,807
[SPEAKER_13]: If that's in reference to the one we brought forward a couple of years ago, as far as I know, that's on hold.

375
00:24:26,867 --> 00:24:35,252
[SPEAKER_13]: We were requested by MWRA to move our gas main so they could accommodate a restoration project of their water line.

376
00:24:36,873 --> 00:24:41,915
[SPEAKER_13]: And I believe that's on hold, so our work isn't necessary at this time.

377
00:24:41,935 --> 00:24:48,559
[SPEAKER_13]: At some point, though, you know, we do an evaluation of our

378
00:24:49,144 --> 00:24:52,366
[SPEAKER_13]: our gas lines based on either reliability or integrity.

379
00:24:52,546 --> 00:25:06,235
[SPEAKER_13]: And independently of that MWRA project, we may find that it comes up for replacement, but I don't know if that's in the near future or far off at this time.

380
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:08,676
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

381
00:25:08,696 --> 00:25:12,999
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, certainly if it does come back up, coordination would be preferred.

382
00:25:13,019 --> 00:25:13,699
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

383
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:14,480
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course.

384
00:25:15,961 --> 00:25:16,701
[SPEAKER_14]: Any further discussion?

385
00:25:18,674 --> 00:25:19,635
[SPEAKER_14]: And if I could just, Ms.

386
00:25:19,655 --> 00:25:21,897
[SPEAKER_14]: Cuddy, when is work anticipated to begin on this?

387
00:25:23,458 --> 00:25:29,102
[SPEAKER_13]: I think they'd like to start right away because I do believe it is part of a paving program that the city is undertaking.

388
00:25:29,242 --> 00:25:35,367
[SPEAKER_13]: So parts of the project have already been completed and they're just waiting on this last section.

389
00:25:35,387 --> 00:25:37,228
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

390
00:25:38,469 --> 00:25:42,032
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of Councilor, oh, sorry, it's public hearing.

391
00:25:42,612 --> 00:25:43,453
[SPEAKER_14]: I need to open.

392
00:25:44,546 --> 00:25:53,213
[SPEAKER_14]: So if we did have the petitioner already spoke, so as this is a public hearing, if anyone would like to speak in favor of this project, please speak up.

393
00:25:54,714 --> 00:25:56,075
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm in favor of this project.

394
00:25:57,336 --> 00:25:58,637
[SPEAKER_22]: My name is Richard Orlando.

395
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:00,458
[SPEAKER_22]: I live on Winford Way in Medford.

396
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:04,401
[SPEAKER_22]: This is more just a point of information and perhaps to the city engineer.

397
00:26:05,222 --> 00:26:11,807
[SPEAKER_22]: What performance criteria measurements does the city put on not only this particular contract,

398
00:26:12,507 --> 00:26:28,053
[SPEAKER_22]: Contractor others in terms of just the timing, the schedule, the duration of the project, daily cleanup sweeping of the streets to basically make sure that the area where there are residents that there it minimizes the negative impact.

399
00:26:28,273 --> 00:26:31,114
[SPEAKER_22]: So to the engineer, how are you managing that?

400
00:26:31,794 --> 00:26:33,074
[SPEAKER_22]: And what criteria do you have?

401
00:26:33,095 --> 00:26:34,775
[SPEAKER_14]: There are a number of conditions for approval.

402
00:26:34,835 --> 00:26:37,136
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm happy to share my copy with you, but I'll let him speak as well.

403
00:26:38,606 --> 00:26:39,767
[SPEAKER_06]: that they need to speak with you guys.

404
00:26:39,787 --> 00:26:41,187
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct We've set a few conditions.

405
00:26:41,387 --> 00:26:49,731
[SPEAKER_06]: We can, um, also include that they need to speak with you guys and make sure that they have, um, erosion and sedimentation controls underway.

406
00:26:50,352 --> 00:26:54,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Um we do supervise the projects accordingly when they're doing stuff.

407
00:26:55,014 --> 00:26:59,736
[SPEAKER_06]: We said, um, we make sure that, uh, you know, their

408
00:27:08,033 --> 00:27:14,137
[SPEAKER_06]: there are any issues, you know, I hear you, you can always contact my office and we will definitely be out there.

409
00:27:16,638 --> 00:27:23,142
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd also like to add that a job of project of this scope, um, the butters do get notified.

410
00:27:23,202 --> 00:27:30,547
[SPEAKER_13]: They will receive a notice and they were including the supervisor's phone number and the supervisor's name on the notices in case there's questions.

411
00:27:31,147 --> 00:27:35,910
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, they are out there, um, you know, at your, um,

412
00:27:36,605 --> 00:27:44,447
[SPEAKER_13]: disposal to have any questions answered that are specific to the job.

413
00:27:45,267 --> 00:27:46,728
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, they're on the agenda itself.

414
00:27:47,368 --> 00:28:04,152
[SPEAKER_20]: Madam President, I do think it's also important to point out when you look at the conditions of improvement, the city engineer's office has been able to secure some mitigation for some existing defects in the sidewalks and streets there that aren't necessarily in relation to this project, but are going to get done as part of the project mitigation purposes.

415
00:28:04,836 --> 00:28:05,837
[SPEAKER_20]: That's something that I'm happy to see.

416
00:28:05,857 --> 00:28:09,280
[SPEAKER_20]: It's something we've called for in the past, and I'm glad to see that it's making its way into these grants.

417
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,001
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

418
00:28:11,581 --> 00:28:14,063
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there anyone else who would like to speak in favor of the paper?

419
00:28:14,384 --> 00:28:15,705
[SPEAKER_14]: I do see one hand up on Zoom.

420
00:28:15,745 --> 00:28:19,408
[SPEAKER_14]: If you'd like to speak in favor of the paper, name and address for the record, please.

421
00:28:23,131 --> 00:28:25,092
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, my name is Gay O'Hanasian.

422
00:28:25,452 --> 00:28:26,493
[SPEAKER_12]: I had a couple of questions.

423
00:28:27,294 --> 00:28:29,876
[SPEAKER_12]: My address is 239 High Street.

424
00:28:31,117 --> 00:28:31,737
[SPEAKER_12]: I was wondering,

425
00:28:33,186 --> 00:28:37,928
[SPEAKER_12]: if you could clarify exactly where the beginning end of this payment will be.

426
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:43,271
[SPEAKER_13]: So for the main replacement on St.

427
00:28:43,311 --> 00:28:46,353
[SPEAKER_13]: James Road, it's basically the entire length of the road.

428
00:28:48,294 --> 00:28:48,494
[SPEAKER_12]: St.

429
00:28:48,554 --> 00:28:48,854
[SPEAKER_12]: James.

430
00:28:49,174 --> 00:28:50,735
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, great.

431
00:28:51,235 --> 00:28:55,517
[SPEAKER_13]: Riverside Ave to Felsway, I believe is the far end.

432
00:28:55,777 --> 00:28:55,977
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

433
00:28:58,839 --> 00:28:59,079
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

434
00:29:00,555 --> 00:29:02,776
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's great that the paving will be done.

435
00:29:03,557 --> 00:29:07,899
[SPEAKER_12]: So to as counselors and said to improve the streets of Medford.

436
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:16,103
[SPEAKER_12]: A couple other questions do we know and this may not be to you, maybe to engineering or public works.

437
00:29:17,864 --> 00:29:24,568
[SPEAKER_12]: Are there any upcoming street openings in that area for the next three years that are known.

438
00:29:27,741 --> 00:29:30,542
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll refer that to Owen, but usually they're coordinating.

439
00:29:32,002 --> 00:29:36,983
[SPEAKER_14]: To the engineer, it should... Yes, hi.

440
00:29:37,603 --> 00:29:39,143
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, there are other areas.

441
00:29:39,163 --> 00:29:47,105
[SPEAKER_06]: I do not know them off the top of my head for the next three years, but if you can reach out to the office, I'll be sure to get those to you, okay?

442
00:29:47,745 --> 00:29:49,545
[SPEAKER_12]: No, for this section.

443
00:29:50,265 --> 00:29:53,366
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't have any planned just for this section.

444
00:29:54,551 --> 00:29:54,971
[SPEAKER_06]: For St.

445
00:29:55,011 --> 00:29:56,132
[SPEAKER_06]: James Road, no.

446
00:29:56,793 --> 00:30:00,296
[SPEAKER_06]: We've coordinated with National Grid for this one section, yes.

447
00:30:00,996 --> 00:30:01,256
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

448
00:30:01,497 --> 00:30:04,559
[SPEAKER_12]: And is the scope curb to curb?

449
00:30:04,779 --> 00:30:11,404
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a little hard to understand that because it sounds like there's some sidewalk work that will be done, too, as extra mitigation.

450
00:30:14,467 --> 00:30:16,068
[SPEAKER_06]: Diana should answer this question.

451
00:30:17,802 --> 00:30:35,909
[SPEAKER_13]: I, from my understanding we are replacing this particular piece of gas mean to accommodate the city's paving so regarding the sidewalks I'm not sure, but I would assume the city's either doing centerline to curb or curb to curb but I would.

452
00:30:35,929 --> 00:30:36,570
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

453
00:30:39,931 --> 00:30:42,492
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, that sounds good so I would be in favor of that.

454
00:30:44,266 --> 00:30:44,606
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

455
00:30:45,047 --> 00:30:47,288
[SPEAKER_14]: Does anyone else would like to speak in favor of the paper?

456
00:30:47,308 --> 00:30:50,371
[SPEAKER_14]: Not seeing any.

457
00:30:51,431 --> 00:30:52,772
[SPEAKER_14]: Portion of the public hearing is closed.

458
00:30:52,812 --> 00:30:55,134
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there anyone in opposition of the paper who would like to speak?

459
00:30:58,477 --> 00:31:01,259
[SPEAKER_14]: Seeing none, this portion of the public hearing is closed.

460
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:04,902
[SPEAKER_19]: We give them- Motion to waive the public comment period.

461
00:31:05,622 --> 00:31:10,146
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of Vice President Behrs to waive the public comment period, seconded by Councilor Sang.

462
00:31:10,186 --> 00:31:10,906
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

463
00:31:11,086 --> 00:31:11,206
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

464
00:31:11,527 --> 00:31:12,207
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

465
00:31:12,227 --> 00:31:12,988
[SPEAKER_14]: The motion passes.

466
00:31:13,644 --> 00:31:19,148
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of Councillor Knight to approve the paper, seconded by Councillor Scarpelli.

467
00:31:19,268 --> 00:31:20,429
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

468
00:31:27,373 --> 00:31:27,754
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

469
00:31:29,395 --> 00:31:29,635
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

470
00:31:30,756 --> 00:31:31,016
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

471
00:31:31,716 --> 00:31:31,856
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

472
00:31:31,876 --> 00:31:32,197
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

473
00:31:33,317 --> 00:31:33,597
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

474
00:31:34,338 --> 00:31:34,618
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

475
00:31:35,479 --> 00:31:35,719
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

476
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:38,080
[SPEAKER_14]: So in the affirmative zero in the negative the motion passes.

477
00:31:38,301 --> 00:31:39,722
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion to revert to regular order business.

478
00:31:40,942 --> 00:31:51,036
[SPEAKER_14]: on a motion of vice-president bears to revert to the regular order of business seconded by good one more sure correct

479
00:32:11,948 --> 00:32:15,449
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure, there is a representative from Eversource on the line, I'm not sure.

480
00:32:15,529 --> 00:32:17,490
[SPEAKER_16]: So we can get our questions answered.

481
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:19,071
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure.

482
00:32:19,891 --> 00:32:22,872
[SPEAKER_14]: City engineer, could you speak to that as far as a future date or?

483
00:32:23,913 --> 00:32:25,333
[SPEAKER_16]: That would be more for Owen.

484
00:32:25,753 --> 00:32:26,594
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh sorry, I'm not sure.

485
00:32:26,974 --> 00:32:27,114
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

486
00:32:28,425 --> 00:32:28,825
[SPEAKER_14]: He's still here.

487
00:32:29,085 --> 00:32:39,312
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not sure if you heard Councillor Carviello just referring to a previous agenda item in which we asked for a meeting with yourself as well as the public and Eversource.

488
00:32:39,873 --> 00:32:41,354
[SPEAKER_14]: On an update on the Eversource project.

489
00:32:41,374 --> 00:32:46,337
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if you could give us an update on when we might be able to have them come out.

490
00:32:47,578 --> 00:32:52,341
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, like I said, fortunately, we didn't know about the meeting and we had a meeting already scheduled.

491
00:32:53,122 --> 00:32:56,624
[SPEAKER_14]: And I do see there is someone from Eversource on the line at the moment.

492
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:57,505
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, I need to unmute you.

493
00:32:59,967 --> 00:33:06,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I believe Todd is here from Eversource, and I believe he's ready to speak on that, or maybe it's Tim.

494
00:33:08,832 --> 00:33:15,256
[SPEAKER_20]: Madam President, with all due respect, this is a pretty big issue we've been talking about for quite a bit of time, but I had no idea that they were coming tonight.

495
00:33:15,276 --> 00:33:17,938
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know if anybody else had any awareness whether or not they were coming this evening.

496
00:33:18,138 --> 00:33:19,519
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, they're here tonight to talk about it?

497
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,820
[SPEAKER_20]: Apparently, that's what the city engineer just mentioned.

498
00:33:22,601 --> 00:33:26,603
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we were asked to come last week, and I believe it was continued to this week.

499
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:35,185
[SPEAKER_16]: Unfortunately, we were not informed that we were going to be talking about this tonight.

500
00:33:39,067 --> 00:33:39,347
[SPEAKER_14]: We did.

501
00:33:40,108 --> 00:33:42,309
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, we did move it to unfinished business last week.

502
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:44,291
[SPEAKER_14]: So they could come back.

503
00:33:44,371 --> 00:33:46,732
[SPEAKER_14]: So the paper is on the table, but I understand that.

504
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:50,595
[SPEAKER_14]: So I mean, yeah, we can get an update.

505
00:33:50,635 --> 00:33:51,475
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, we can get an update.

506
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:51,855
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

507
00:33:52,636 --> 00:33:52,816
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

508
00:33:53,476 --> 00:33:55,057
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I think we can get an update at this time.

509
00:33:57,423 --> 00:33:59,446
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you have a word or the rules are suspended?

510
00:33:59,466 --> 00:34:00,747
[SPEAKER_14]: Does anyone want to take that from the table?

511
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:09,198
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion to take paper 22 dash something 361 off the table.

512
00:34:13,748 --> 00:34:19,349
[SPEAKER_14]: The motion of items and bears to take paper 22-361 off the table, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

513
00:34:19,369 --> 00:34:20,010
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

514
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:21,730
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

515
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:22,770
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

516
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:30,172
[SPEAKER_14]: So Todd Lanham, if you could give us an update, a general update on where the Eversource project stands.

517
00:34:30,212 --> 00:34:38,934
[SPEAKER_14]: I do think there is a need for a future meeting that is more early, more lead time to notice this so people can attend.

518
00:34:39,014 --> 00:34:41,175
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think we've been waiting for this update for a very long time.

519
00:34:42,611 --> 00:34:43,131
[SPEAKER_14]: speak to that.

520
00:34:43,211 --> 00:34:43,952
[SPEAKER_14]: I will unmute you.

521
00:34:45,692 --> 00:34:45,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.

522
00:34:46,052 --> 00:34:46,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

523
00:34:46,312 --> 00:34:47,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

524
00:34:47,053 --> 00:34:47,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

525
00:34:47,313 --> 00:34:49,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Todd Lanham here with Eversource.

526
00:34:50,314 --> 00:35:03,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Just for the record, office address is 247 Station Drive in Westwood, and I do have a very brief update, a very brief subset of a presentation that we actually gave to residents last week.

527
00:35:03,598 --> 00:35:05,119
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to share that if I may.

528
00:35:05,139 --> 00:35:07,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Would that please the council?

529
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:10,531
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you able to share your screen?

530
00:35:10,911 --> 00:35:13,873
[SPEAKER_14]: Or could you please make him a co-host, Mr. Clerk?

531
00:35:15,394 --> 00:35:16,515
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very short.

532
00:35:16,555 --> 00:35:22,098
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, more than happy to come back and do this in a more in-depth forum if you'd like.

533
00:35:22,138 --> 00:35:28,422
[SPEAKER_03]: But I thought at least for this forum, five short slides, a little brief narrative about where we are.

534
00:35:28,442 --> 00:35:31,805
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. Lanham.

535
00:35:31,845 --> 00:35:33,746
[SPEAKER_14]: You should be able to share your screen now if you'd like to try.

536
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:35,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see if we can do this.

537
00:35:37,945 --> 00:35:39,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you seeing my title slide now?

538
00:35:40,226 --> 00:35:40,326
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

539
00:35:40,386 --> 00:35:41,847
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, perfect.

540
00:35:41,887 --> 00:35:42,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

541
00:35:42,228 --> 00:35:44,009
[SPEAKER_03]: So once again, Todd Lanham with Eversource.

542
00:35:44,429 --> 00:35:50,112
[SPEAKER_03]: I am here tonight just to give you a very brief presentation on where we are with this project.

543
00:35:50,292 --> 00:35:55,415
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna go through five slides relatively quickly, certainly be able to take some questions and answers.

544
00:35:55,475 --> 00:36:07,082
[SPEAKER_03]: If we have any, I'll do my best to answer any questions that you may have, or as we've discussed, if you would like, be happy to come out and give a more detailed conversation to members of the council if you'd like.

545
00:36:11,152 --> 00:36:11,632
[SPEAKER_14]: please proceed.

546
00:36:12,972 --> 00:36:14,273
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to, um.

547
00:36:15,093 --> 00:36:15,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Forward.

548
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:15,673
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.

549
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:17,954
[SPEAKER_03]: So just to re ground everybody.

550
00:36:18,394 --> 00:36:23,255
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we all know about the segment of construction that goes through Medford.

551
00:36:23,715 --> 00:36:31,857
[SPEAKER_03]: What you see on the screen here is represented of the conduit or the pipe and green and red and in the boxes.

552
00:36:31,937 --> 00:36:34,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Those represent the nine manholes that we

553
00:36:41,369 --> 00:36:45,790
[SPEAKER_03]: on the pipe that's in Medford represents sections that have been installed.

554
00:36:46,511 --> 00:36:50,152
[SPEAKER_03]: The red sections in Medford are the ones that remain.

555
00:36:51,252 --> 00:37:05,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Out of the approximately 3.2 miles of pipe that we have had to install in Medford, approximately 2.7 miles of that has been completed, or roughly 87%.

556
00:37:05,496 --> 00:37:06,677
[SPEAKER_03]: We have about 2,200 feet left to go.

557
00:37:13,545 --> 00:37:15,206
[SPEAKER_03]: So where are we working currently?

558
00:37:15,306 --> 00:37:21,749
[SPEAKER_03]: What this slide tells you kind of goes through some of the segments that we have been working on.

559
00:37:22,249 --> 00:37:24,610
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see some of the completed segments.

560
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:29,853
[SPEAKER_03]: We're actively working in the locations where you currently see the blue.

561
00:37:29,993 --> 00:37:37,056
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's from Mystic Valley Parkway to High Street, and then also South Street to Main Street.

562
00:37:37,096 --> 00:37:41,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the two sections where we currently have crews during the daytime,

563
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:47,296
[SPEAKER_03]: for mystic Valley Parkway and then we have nine crews working on the South Street and Main Street.

564
00:37:48,097 --> 00:38:03,746
[SPEAKER_03]: The other sections that are in black represent some projected completion dates or activity dates, given all the activities that you heard about the coordination between a lot of different competing interests, as you heard tonight.

565
00:38:04,395 --> 00:38:06,716
[SPEAKER_03]: other providers have activities going on in there.

566
00:38:06,776 --> 00:38:17,300
[SPEAKER_03]: So these dates are somewhat flexible, but we try to give you an idea about when we think construction may commence and when it may complete.

567
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:23,783
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, the two in blue are the ones I wanted to focus on tonight is that's where we have active construction.

568
00:38:26,244 --> 00:38:33,107
[SPEAKER_03]: So to talk about one of the work zones here between Mystic Valley Parkway and High Street, you see, if you can see on my screen,

569
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:37,231
[SPEAKER_03]: This is one section where we're currently actively working.

570
00:38:37,892 --> 00:38:43,353
[SPEAKER_03]: The forecast right now is to complete this section sometime later this summer, early fall.

571
00:38:44,134 --> 00:38:53,517
[SPEAKER_03]: And from there, we will go to the second segment here between High Street and Winthrop Street.

572
00:38:54,377 --> 00:38:56,578
[SPEAKER_03]: These are both in the same section.

573
00:38:56,938 --> 00:39:01,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Roughly speaking, we just broke them down into two individual pieces to make it a little more

574
00:39:02,897 --> 00:39:08,718
[SPEAKER_03]: easy to understand, but this work right here will probably last through the end of the year.

575
00:39:11,699 --> 00:39:16,780
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also the section that we talked about from South Street to Main Street that we're currently working on.

576
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:21,221
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see here both the graphic and the forecasted schedule.

577
00:39:22,262 --> 00:39:32,364
[SPEAKER_03]: As we continue to work with engineering, DBW staff, public safety, we continue to try to optimize the schedules to do more work more efficiently.

578
00:39:32,747 --> 00:39:38,009
[SPEAKER_03]: more timely, but this gives you a rough idea about this section of work right here.

579
00:39:38,169 --> 00:39:43,951
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very complicated corner, as it were, where we're trying to install the pipe currently.

580
00:39:48,173 --> 00:39:49,613
[SPEAKER_03]: That was very, very brief.

581
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:59,697
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say this, this is, again, this is a very small subset of the entire presentation that we did earlier this week with the community group.

582
00:40:00,973 --> 00:40:01,373
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

583
00:40:01,493 --> 00:40:07,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and if you have anything else to add, or I'm certainly happy to try and answer any questions.

584
00:40:07,895 --> 00:40:12,576
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have any, but I hope that gave you at least a little bit of, of information.

585
00:40:13,537 --> 00:40:17,938
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as where we're actively working, and at least some interim projections there.

586
00:40:20,178 --> 00:40:20,819
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

587
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:21,579
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

588
00:40:30,054 --> 00:40:32,115
[SPEAKER_16]: Are you going to be doing any more digging on Mystic Avenue?

589
00:40:33,796 --> 00:40:36,418
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to be doing any more digging on Mystic Avenue.

590
00:40:36,438 --> 00:40:44,482
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe the answer to that question, I'm waiting for some of my engineering friends that are on with me tonight to confirm.

591
00:40:44,923 --> 00:40:49,045
[SPEAKER_03]: We are not going to be doing any more digging on Mystic Avenue, as I understand.

592
00:40:49,865 --> 00:40:57,710
[SPEAKER_16]: So is there a reason, would it be possible to start grinding and paving at least Mystic Avenue?

593
00:40:58,225 --> 00:41:04,268
[SPEAKER_16]: In the meantime, seeing that you're not doing any work there during the summer before the winter comes.

594
00:41:06,389 --> 00:41:09,691
[SPEAKER_16]: Because you're gonna be replacing the road.

595
00:41:11,932 --> 00:41:13,013
[SPEAKER_03]: That is correct.

596
00:41:13,033 --> 00:41:15,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me, again, I'm trying, I apologize.

597
00:41:15,114 --> 00:41:19,176
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to stop sharing my screen so I can get back to this.

598
00:41:19,236 --> 00:41:20,977
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me just stop this here.

599
00:41:20,997 --> 00:41:26,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I did the wrong thing.

600
00:41:26,759 --> 00:41:27,680
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize here.

601
00:41:31,935 --> 00:41:36,356
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess the question is, when are we going to be able to pave the Mystic Valley Parkway?

602
00:41:36,396 --> 00:41:37,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that the correct answer?

603
00:41:38,697 --> 00:41:39,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Gabb.

604
00:41:40,097 --> 00:41:45,659
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, if that part has already been, is already complete, you're not going to be doing any more digging there.

605
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:58,323
[SPEAKER_16]: Why can't you at least get that paved at least up to Soul Street in the interest of, you know, before the end of the summer or before the winter time comes?

606
00:42:01,699 --> 00:42:05,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I'm waiting for one of my engineers that are here with me on the call.

607
00:42:05,782 --> 00:42:08,583
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm waiting for them to help help me out with that answer.

608
00:42:08,603 --> 00:42:10,084
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you'll bear with me one second.

609
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:16,048
[SPEAKER_03]: I do believe we have some sections of restoration prepared for later this summer.

610
00:42:17,149 --> 00:42:25,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I think it's a function of making sure that we optimize the schedule working collaboratively with the DPW and the staff to make sure that

611
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:35,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody that has work in and around the streets can complete it before we do the paving but right now I do think later this summer, and oh and correct me if I'm wrong.

612
00:42:36,312 --> 00:42:39,973
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're looking at later this year to try and get some of that repaving done.

613
00:42:41,713 --> 00:42:48,195
[SPEAKER_16]: And as I do agree that you know we shouldn't be paving, especially if we know we're going to be if there's going to be other utilities.

614
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:56,788
[SPEAKER_16]: going in there, but I'd like to see at least down to the police station done before you make the turn going on the South Street.

615
00:42:56,828 --> 00:43:01,453
[SPEAKER_16]: Because again, that's the Mr. Gaff pad has been done for a while.

616
00:43:01,513 --> 00:43:05,497
[SPEAKER_16]: So again, that would be great if you could at least get Mr. Gavin you done.

617
00:43:05,517 --> 00:43:07,980
[SPEAKER_16]: And then we can move forward too.

618
00:43:10,853 --> 00:43:33,629
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, I will tell you this we do have a weekly meeting with the engineering staff and the DPW staff, I will make sure that we bring this up with our weekly meeting to to talk about those desires, and again, provided all of the competing interest we can get in there and get all of the activity on that we need to do and the other utilities, and the city projects.

619
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:39,213
[SPEAKER_03]: Perhaps we can try to get that page sooner as opposed to later I'm sorry, I think I'm talking over you.

620
00:43:40,777 --> 00:43:43,039
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, I couldn't get unmuted here.

621
00:43:43,279 --> 00:43:54,468
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically, I believe that the for this year, they are going to focus on Winthrop Street, instead of mystic, Mystic Avenue.

622
00:43:55,518 --> 00:44:01,062
[SPEAKER_06]: and we're trying to time those up with some of the subdivisions and the other work that is going on in the street.

623
00:44:02,463 --> 00:44:06,786
[SPEAKER_06]: At least that's the upper portion of Winthrop Street to get it milled.

624
00:44:07,266 --> 00:44:17,594
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe the things that still need to happen in Mystic Ave is some of the pipe proofing and vacuum testing along with the whole corridor.

625
00:44:17,814 --> 00:44:21,116
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's, those are the things that are kind of

626
00:44:22,537 --> 00:44:31,561
[SPEAKER_06]: holding up the milling and the paving as of this moment, as of currently, they need to go through that testing process before they can mill and overlay.

627
00:44:33,602 --> 00:44:33,942
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

628
00:44:34,262 --> 00:44:40,865
[SPEAKER_16]: And do you have some kind of a completion date for this project?

629
00:44:44,466 --> 00:44:50,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I think not wanting to over commit and then under deliver, we are working

630
00:44:51,383 --> 00:44:56,926
[SPEAKER_03]: diligently to try and complete all the work or as much of the work as we can during this year.

631
00:44:56,946 --> 00:45:02,049
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of factors that go into that construction has been rather challenging.

632
00:45:02,269 --> 00:45:03,790
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we've been out here for a while.

633
00:45:04,771 --> 00:45:14,096
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, I think the collaboration with the staff and public safety to make sure that we are working in a safe and efficient manner.

634
00:45:14,377 --> 00:45:15,797
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's what we're trying to do.

635
00:45:15,837 --> 00:45:16,598
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't again,

636
00:45:17,334 --> 00:45:30,862
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hesitant to give you a date, but just know that the intent is for us to wrap this up as quickly as possible and complete the restoration as quickly and safely as we possibly can.

637
00:45:31,683 --> 00:45:35,525
[SPEAKER_03]: Owen, I don't know if you have anything that you'd like to add on that.

638
00:45:35,845 --> 00:45:44,851
[SPEAKER_16]: Hopefully construction will be done by the end of this year, and hopefully maybe next year you can start paving all the streets that have been dug up.

639
00:45:45,491 --> 00:45:46,492
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that a good assumption?

640
00:45:47,222 --> 00:45:50,304
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a good I think that's what we're working towards again.

641
00:45:50,404 --> 00:45:51,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and I apologize.

642
00:45:51,605 --> 00:45:52,966
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like I'm talking over you.

643
00:45:53,006 --> 00:46:14,762
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that's what staff and and ever source are working collaboratively on is to try to make sure that we finish up as quickly as we can, utilizing as many of the resources that the town and the staff can can provide, and just make sure that this work is completed quickly and safely.

644
00:46:15,452 --> 00:46:28,279
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, also I'd like to add that the city's working collaboratively with Eversource to try to get more crews and details for them so that they can expedite this work during this season.

645
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:42,788
[SPEAKER_06]: We know that this has gone on a long time and we are very, we're working with them diligently to make sure that this project gets wrapped up.

646
00:46:46,161 --> 00:46:47,221
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Vice President Behrs.

647
00:46:49,002 --> 00:46:50,783
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Cabrera, I'll ask all my questions, thank you.

648
00:46:51,783 --> 00:46:52,644
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Nye.

649
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:54,225
[SPEAKER_20]: Madam President, thank you very much.

650
00:46:54,445 --> 00:46:59,487
[SPEAKER_20]: I had the opportunity to go through some of the files that weren't stolen from my desk by one of the members of the school committee.

651
00:47:00,347 --> 00:47:03,388
[SPEAKER_20]: And what I found was a document dated 2015.

652
00:47:04,149 --> 00:47:13,753
[SPEAKER_20]: And this document was on May 19th, 2015, which is our initial introduction to the Ebersole Statistic to Woburn Pipeline Project.

653
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:23,955
[SPEAKER_20]: At that time, we had some discussions where they said that this was gonna go to the Department of Public Utilities and then construction was gonna start in 2016.

654
00:47:23,995 --> 00:47:32,940
[SPEAKER_20]: In 2017, I'm sorry, 2017 we met and this was pushed out to 2018 to start construction.

655
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:36,321
[SPEAKER_20]: The construction said it was gonna be nine vaults.

656
00:47:37,802 --> 00:47:42,985
[SPEAKER_20]: As of our last meeting, February 4th, 2020, five of the nine vaults were completed.

657
00:47:44,913 --> 00:47:52,977
[SPEAKER_20]: As we go through our old files and paperwork that we see here, it says Eversource is going to provide us with weekly updates via email.

658
00:47:53,357 --> 00:47:57,699
[SPEAKER_20]: There'd be a Medford-specific website and Medford-specific community events and meetings surrounding this project.

659
00:47:57,919 --> 00:47:58,720
[SPEAKER_20]: We haven't seen any of that.

660
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:04,963
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know how many requests we've made to get the curb stones removed from the front of Victory Park that have been sitting there for two and a half years.

661
00:48:06,044 --> 00:48:07,664
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, just small quality of life things.

662
00:48:07,704 --> 00:48:12,327
[SPEAKER_20]: We know it's going to take a while to get the construction done, but don't leave the place looking like a dump for five years.

663
00:48:12,936 --> 00:48:15,318
[SPEAKER_20]: five, actually seven, seven years now for seven years.

664
00:48:15,498 --> 00:48:15,778
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

665
00:48:15,798 --> 00:48:17,880
[SPEAKER_20]: So I don't know how long it took them to build that tunnel in Boston.

666
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:18,260
[SPEAKER_20]: I think it was 14.

667
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:19,501
[SPEAKER_20]: We're almost halfway there.

668
00:48:19,922 --> 00:48:21,483
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, this is like the credit bridge part two.

669
00:48:21,983 --> 00:48:22,263
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

670
00:48:22,604 --> 00:48:23,544
[SPEAKER_20]: We got to get this thing done.

671
00:48:24,725 --> 00:48:32,971
[SPEAKER_20]: Now a quick question is the pipeline project portion in the city of Somerville complete?

672
00:48:37,035 --> 00:48:41,338
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't believe it is, but let, again, let me, sorry, I apologize.

673
00:48:41,923 --> 00:48:47,667
[SPEAKER_03]: polling my colleagues No, I don't believe that portion and some of those complete yet either.

674
00:48:49,848 --> 00:48:52,990
[SPEAKER_20]: Is the pipeline project portion in Winchester complete.

675
00:48:56,912 --> 00:48:58,013
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it is not.

676
00:48:59,094 --> 00:49:00,755
[SPEAKER_20]: Is the pipeline portion in Woburn.

677
00:49:12,895 --> 00:49:19,398
[SPEAKER_03]: On the Woburn side, I do know that there was work that has been completed inside the substation.

678
00:49:20,138 --> 00:49:23,199
[SPEAKER_03]: But as far as the street work, I don't believe that that has been completed.

679
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:26,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Just the work inside the substation has been completed.

680
00:49:28,661 --> 00:49:31,402
[SPEAKER_20]: 2015 was a long time ago.

681
00:49:34,284 --> 00:49:35,184
[SPEAKER_20]: And this still isn't done.

682
00:49:35,664 --> 00:49:37,705
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, there has to be some accountability.

683
00:49:39,379 --> 00:49:42,221
[SPEAKER_20]: What are the contributing factors to this taking so long?

684
00:49:42,361 --> 00:49:45,223
[SPEAKER_20]: Is it that we don't have the crews to do the work?

685
00:49:45,303 --> 00:49:46,624
[SPEAKER_20]: Is it that it had to be rebid?

686
00:49:46,684 --> 00:49:50,187
[SPEAKER_20]: I think it had to be rebid at one point in time, if I'm not mistaken.

687
00:49:50,647 --> 00:49:53,449
[SPEAKER_20]: But is it that we can't get police details to be out there?

688
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:55,691
[SPEAKER_20]: Is the city administration saying we can't run crews?

689
00:49:56,612 --> 00:49:58,193
[SPEAKER_20]: What's the holdup on the construction?

690
00:49:59,774 --> 00:50:01,356
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's been a myriad of factors.

691
00:50:02,056 --> 00:50:03,857
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of uncharted utilities.

692
00:50:04,338 --> 00:50:06,800
[SPEAKER_03]: We ran into a lot of unexpected encumbrances.

693
00:50:07,638 --> 00:50:10,939
[SPEAKER_03]: We did rebid the project at one point in times.

694
00:50:12,819 --> 00:50:15,320
[SPEAKER_03]: I do think you have a lot of valid questions.

695
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:21,841
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be more than happy rather than take up the time for the council hearing tonight.

696
00:50:21,941 --> 00:50:29,823
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be more than happy to schedule some time to come talk to the council individually and have a more detailed conversation in person if that would please the council.

697
00:50:33,676 --> 00:50:40,579
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, we've had enough of these meetings in the past where I don't think anything's going to please us other than the job being done and everybody being out of here.

698
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:50,604
[SPEAKER_20]: The residents of Winthrop Street now, since I've been on the council with my ninth year, we've done the Winthrop Street Rotary project that closed that area down for a year and a half.

699
00:50:51,285 --> 00:50:55,627
[SPEAKER_20]: Then they did three years of the Craddock Bridge, which destroyed traffic right through the Winthrop Street Rotary.

700
00:50:56,107 --> 00:50:57,548
[SPEAKER_20]: And then we started the Ebersource project.

701
00:50:58,048 --> 00:51:02,230
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, so for the past decade, this area has been just decimated.

702
00:51:02,695 --> 00:51:05,437
[SPEAKER_20]: with traffic detours traffic management plans and underground construction.

703
00:51:05,958 --> 00:51:15,547
[SPEAKER_20]: So it needs to get done and I don't fault you sir I know this isn't your fault and all this is a gigantic regional multi billion dollar project that you guys are trying to get done, but we have to understand.

704
00:51:17,228 --> 00:51:22,653
[SPEAKER_20]: I think we should take you up on your offer I think that this is something that could go into, you know, a little bit more detail.

705
00:51:23,290 --> 00:51:30,711
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, as I pull out some more files and notes, I'm gonna have more questions and I got enough of them in here in front of me to make this go on forever.

706
00:51:30,731 --> 00:51:38,353
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'm gonna rest my case and I'm gonna take the gentleman up on his offer and make a request that this paper be referred to a committee of the whole for future date.

707
00:51:39,613 --> 00:51:40,133
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor.

708
00:51:40,153 --> 00:51:40,393
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

709
00:51:41,013 --> 00:51:43,073
[SPEAKER_14]: Further discussion from the Council at this time.

710
00:51:43,233 --> 00:51:43,834
[SPEAKER_19]: Second the motion.

711
00:51:43,874 --> 00:51:49,855
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I do see Jay Oganessian with your hand up on Zoom.

712
00:51:50,395 --> 00:51:52,455
[SPEAKER_14]: Would you like to just name and address for the record, please?

713
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,242
[SPEAKER_12]: Gayle and Asian 239 High Street.

714
00:51:58,122 --> 00:52:06,527
[SPEAKER_12]: I live very close to Winthrop circle and agree with Councilman night that it has been horrendous for.

715
00:52:10,957 --> 00:52:29,785
[SPEAKER_12]: number of years, and I do want to say that was working for and star slash ever source at time when the winter street drainage project was going through at the circle and helped out with that so very familiar with the construction in that area, when it was opened up.

716
00:52:30,225 --> 00:52:32,006
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a lot of rock and ledge there.

717
00:52:32,666 --> 00:52:36,207
[SPEAKER_12]: But I want to go back to I took some notes here.

718
00:52:37,948 --> 00:52:40,871
[SPEAKER_12]: The questions were very good from the councilman.

719
00:52:41,913 --> 00:52:56,629
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think we have to ask a little more pointed questions because in stepping back, this project has a number of phases that Owen discussed to it's there's trenching of the pipe.

720
00:52:57,808 --> 00:53:14,107
[SPEAKER_12]: And then there's proofing of the pipe, you have to make sure that all the welds of the pipe are complete and whole so that there is no leaking of fluid that will be pressurized at 200 psi when this is finalized.

721
00:53:15,188 --> 00:53:15,969
[SPEAKER_12]: The next step

722
00:53:16,802 --> 00:53:23,485
[SPEAKER_12]: is once the pipe is proofed, then it's cleaned and swabbed and a mandrel goes through.

723
00:53:23,505 --> 00:53:27,267
[SPEAKER_12]: And then after that, the cable is pulled through.

724
00:53:28,027 --> 00:53:34,170
[SPEAKER_12]: After the cable is pulled through, they have to remove all the moisture and it's vacuumed.

725
00:53:34,850 --> 00:53:43,454
[SPEAKER_12]: And that takes a while until it reaches a certain level of no, it's down to a micron level.

726
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:45,434
[SPEAKER_12]: And then after that,

727
00:53:46,915 --> 00:53:49,878
[SPEAKER_12]: it can be oil filled, and that takes a while too.

728
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:56,683
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the next step is energizing it and making sure that it's commissioned and working.

729
00:53:57,383 --> 00:53:58,464
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's a few steps.

730
00:53:58,504 --> 00:54:11,635
[SPEAKER_12]: So, to refine Councilman Knight's questions about what is complete, the question should be, is the pipe installed versus is it complete?

731
00:54:12,355 --> 00:54:15,277
[SPEAKER_12]: Because piping and trenching is really the most

732
00:54:18,787 --> 00:54:21,588
[SPEAKER_12]: seen and difficult part of this.

733
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:37,298
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the interruption that occurs mostly, but there will be other interruptions at each manhole location as the vacuuming is done, as the oil filling is done, and between those two things when the

734
00:54:38,979 --> 00:54:41,581
[SPEAKER_12]: cable is pulled too prior to that.

735
00:54:42,461 --> 00:54:50,386
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's a few steps that we will all be seeing and feeling as we drive through.

736
00:54:52,407 --> 00:54:59,911
[SPEAKER_12]: So the questions to reiterate what was asked in Somerville, is the trenching complete?

737
00:55:06,135 --> 00:55:07,376
[SPEAKER_03]: So bear with me one moment.

738
00:55:08,435 --> 00:55:10,597
[SPEAKER_03]: just pulling the engineering team on that.

739
00:55:11,437 --> 00:55:12,418
[SPEAKER_03]: And for Winchester?

740
00:55:13,839 --> 00:55:21,865
[SPEAKER_12]: Woburn is very short, so it doesn't matter because the Woburn Winchester line is right there at the substation.

741
00:55:23,666 --> 00:55:28,949
[SPEAKER_03]: So no, the trenching is not complete in Somerville, nor is it complete in Winchester.

742
00:55:28,990 --> 00:55:33,333
[SPEAKER_03]: So we still got to do trenching activity in both those municipalities.

743
00:55:34,153 --> 00:55:34,413
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

744
00:55:34,754 --> 00:55:37,235
[SPEAKER_12]: So my overall question is, if

745
00:55:40,635 --> 00:55:47,679
[SPEAKER_12]: ever source was given all the support from the city of Medford, that it absolutely can.

746
00:55:47,699 --> 00:55:51,781
[SPEAKER_12]: And you don't have to answer this now but I think you should come back with it.

747
00:55:52,221 --> 00:56:06,849
[SPEAKER_12]: What is the fastest schedule that you think you could get this completed a trench, number one, getting all the pipe in, and then to proofed because to Councilman caveat is.

748
00:56:08,590 --> 00:56:12,922
[SPEAKER_12]: point is when we can start paving is really only after

749
00:56:14,011 --> 00:56:20,252
[SPEAKER_12]: the pipe is proof because it does not make sense to me to dig up a street after it's been paved.

750
00:56:20,292 --> 00:56:24,953
[SPEAKER_12]: That's more annoyance, more trouble, more traffic.

751
00:56:25,393 --> 00:56:28,454
[SPEAKER_12]: If it's done twice, we should do it right the first time.

752
00:56:28,914 --> 00:56:30,934
[SPEAKER_12]: And that means the pipe has to be proofed.

753
00:56:31,495 --> 00:56:36,276
[SPEAKER_12]: And my understanding is that there are a number of segments that can be proofed right now.

754
00:56:36,936 --> 00:56:43,397
[SPEAKER_12]: And is Eversource planning on proofing those now so that we can make the streets ready to be paved?

755
00:56:44,642 --> 00:56:46,143
[SPEAKER_12]: and what sections would they be?

756
00:56:48,044 --> 00:56:49,205
[SPEAKER_12]: And can you do that now?

757
00:56:49,545 --> 00:56:51,206
[SPEAKER_12]: Those are the type of questions.

758
00:56:52,027 --> 00:56:54,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, let me just kind of summarize.

759
00:56:55,029 --> 00:56:56,270
[SPEAKER_03]: All those are great questions.

760
00:56:57,571 --> 00:56:59,752
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know that I can answer everything to your point.

761
00:56:59,892 --> 00:57:03,835
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate you giving me some platitude here, or latitude rather.

762
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:11,120
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some sections that we could potentially work on pipe proofing this year,

763
00:57:11,768 --> 00:57:19,190
[SPEAKER_03]: But I will absolutely bring that up again when we meet with staff later this week to go over.

764
00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:31,872
[SPEAKER_03]: During these weekly meetings, it really is about schedule optimization, finding out where we can work collaboratively with other activities that are going on in Medford, in the streets.

765
00:57:33,152 --> 00:57:40,714
[SPEAKER_03]: So we will bring that up with the staff and work through some of these details that you've asked for later this week when we meet with them.

766
00:57:41,356 --> 00:57:55,162
[SPEAKER_03]: and then we will develop some multiple schedules where we can look at optimizing the schedules and what that does to us completing the work sooner as opposed to later.

767
00:57:55,222 --> 00:58:01,864
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we're just a couple of days early on some of these very, very reasonable questions.

768
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:11,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Just let us work with staff later this week on some of those specifics, because we have been working with them to try and optimize the schedule

769
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:20,556
[SPEAKER_03]: balancing the availability of crews, the sections of the street that multiple entities are needing to work in and so forth.

770
00:58:22,278 --> 00:58:22,919
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, good.

771
00:58:22,979 --> 00:58:36,451
[SPEAKER_12]: So here, what I was thinking, but don't have enough detail, is that, as Richard Carviello had asked about Mystic Ave, if you can proof from, you know, probably the Somerville side all the way down to

772
00:58:37,677 --> 00:58:46,605
[SPEAKER_12]: South Street, practically, if you can proof that, and then that would be ready to be paved, because once it's proofed, you should not have to dig it up again.

773
00:58:47,466 --> 00:58:49,768
[SPEAKER_12]: So that would be helpful and scheduled.

774
00:58:51,409 --> 00:58:52,991
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

775
00:58:53,852 --> 00:58:59,176
[SPEAKER_14]: So we do have a motion on the floor from Councilor Knight to refer the paper to a future committee of the whole, correct?

776
00:59:00,658 --> 00:59:02,319
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight?

777
00:59:02,379 --> 00:59:02,880
[SPEAKER_14]: Seconded by

[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

783
00:59:16,214 --> 00:59:16,775
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. Lane.

784
00:59:16,815 --> 00:59:20,978
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just gonna pass off to vice president bears temporarily.

785
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:22,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you all.

786
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:29,245
[SPEAKER_03]: We appreciate you letting us come this evening and we will, we'll make sure that we're prepared for the next committee of the whole meeting when it's scheduled.

787
00:59:36,913 --> 00:59:37,754
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion on the floor.

788
00:59:40,476 --> 00:59:42,577

00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:47,681
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion is approved.

792
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:48,462
[SPEAKER_19]: Records.

793
00:59:48,502 --> 00:59:52,044
[SPEAKER_19]: The records of the meeting of May 31st, 2022 are passed to Councilor Seng.

794
00:59:52,585 --> 00:59:53,845
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Seng, how'd you find those records?

795
00:59:53,906 --> 00:59:55,447
[SPEAKER_01]: I find them in order and I move to approve.

796
00:59:56,427 --> 00:59:59,750
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion by Councilor Seng to approve the records of the meeting of May 31st, 2022.

797
00:59:59,830 --> 01:00:00,390
[SPEAKER_19]: Seconded by.

798
01:00:00,410 --> 01:00:01,231
[SPEAKER_19]: So moved.

799
01:00:01,791 --> 01:00:02,512
[SPEAKER_19]: Seconded by everybody.

800
01:00:02,832 --> 01:00:03,713
[SPEAKER_19]: Both Councilor Collins.

801
01:00:04,754 --> 01:00:05,434
[SPEAKER_19]: All those in favor.

802
01:00:05,574 --> 01:00:05,874
[SPEAKER_18]: Aye.

803
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:07,870
[SPEAKER_19]: All those opposed?

804
01:00:08,591 --> 01:00:09,391
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion passes.

805
01:00:10,412 --> 01:00:11,472
[SPEAKER_19]: Reports of committees.

[SPEAKER_19]: 22-354, June 1st, Committee of the Whole report to follow.

807
01:00:16,635 --> 01:00:22,878
[SPEAKER_19]: This was... Trees, this was trees.

808
01:00:23,299 --> 01:00:25,160
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, this was a meeting on the tree ordinance.

809
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:27,101
[SPEAKER_19]: I believe we kept the paper and committee pending.

810
01:00:28,381 --> 01:00:31,043
[SPEAKER_19]: Basically a complete overhaul of the draft ordinance by...

811
01:00:31,861 --> 01:00:37,374
[SPEAKER_19]: the legal counsel motion accounts right to approve seconded by Councillor saying all those in favor.

812
01:00:37,394 --> 01:00:39,759
[SPEAKER_19]: I motion passes.

813
01:00:40,805 --> 01:00:44,547
[SPEAKER_19]: Announcements, accolades, and remembrances.

814
01:00:44,568 --> 01:00:45,768
[SPEAKER_19]: 22-372 offered by Councillor Knight.

815
01:00:45,828 --> 01:00:50,952
[SPEAKER_19]: Be it so resolved that Bedford City Council congratulate the students of the class of 2022 on their recent graduation.

816
01:00:51,092 --> 01:00:51,652
[SPEAKER_19]: Councillor Knight.

817
01:00:51,892 --> 01:00:53,153
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

818
01:00:53,253 --> 01:01:03,240
[SPEAKER_20]: After a couple of years of uncertainty, a couple of years of confusion, we've finally seen a class go through the school year without having to learn remotely.

819
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:11,548
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's great to see the class of 2020 had to overcome, 2022 had to overcome some great adversity over their time in school.

820
01:01:12,089 --> 01:01:23,600
[SPEAKER_20]: And I feel for them, Mr. President, I think that ultimately their ability to persevere through these difficult circumstances and reach the goals that they set their minds to shows what type of students that we

821
01:01:24,626 --> 01:01:33,891
[SPEAKER_20]: bring up here in the city of medicine, and I wish them all the best of luck in their future endeavors, whether that's going to the workforce to be coming a member of society or to continuing their education.

822
01:01:34,572 --> 01:01:40,535
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that this is very exciting time for these young adults and their future leaders of medicine so I'd ask my council colleagues to support the resolution.

823
01:01:42,460 --> 01:01:45,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Council President Knight for bringing this forward.

824
01:01:46,504 --> 01:01:51,808
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been a very trying year, not only the congratulations for the students, but also our teachers.

825
01:01:51,868 --> 01:02:01,037
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that if you heard them last night, you know how they've worked and how much time and effort they've put in and getting to this point with this class.

826
01:02:01,097 --> 01:02:05,321
[SPEAKER_05]: So the Method High School students, our Method vocational students,

827
01:02:05,981 --> 01:02:07,743
[SPEAKER_05]: and our Curtis tough students.

828
01:02:08,164 --> 01:02:10,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations on the job well done.

829
01:02:10,907 --> 01:02:17,794
[SPEAKER_05]: And definitely a class that's going to have some great memories, some trying time so thank you.

830
01:02:18,415 --> 01:02:18,815
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

831
01:02:18,915 --> 01:02:23,340
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to thank Councilor Knight for putting this on agenda for me I'm just kidding.

832
01:02:26,267 --> 01:02:33,515
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to thank you for putting this on agenda for for all of our students in Medford who are graduating with the class of 2022.

833
01:02:35,177 --> 01:02:40,203
[SPEAKER_01]: As, as a member of the class of 2022 I think I can say myself that the last few years have not been easy.

834
01:02:41,584 --> 01:02:43,246
[SPEAKER_01]: No one wants to do school via zoom.

835
01:02:43,687 --> 01:02:46,330
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, if we're up to everyone you know we

836
01:02:47,190 --> 01:02:53,653
[SPEAKER_01]: We, the last two and a half years of the pandemic wouldn't have happened, but, you know, this class adapted to it.

837
01:02:53,953 --> 01:02:54,714
[SPEAKER_01]: It persevered.

838
01:02:55,114 --> 01:02:58,015
[SPEAKER_01]: It dealt with the consequences of Zoom school.

839
01:02:58,595 --> 01:03:03,098
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I have to say they did it marvelously.

840
01:03:03,118 --> 01:03:10,081
[SPEAKER_01]: I was at the high school recently for the CCSR, the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibilities project there.

841
01:03:10,581 --> 01:03:20,764
[SPEAKER_01]: where they introduced a bunch of us to the projects that they were working on and to see the leadership of our senior class at Medford High School, at Medford Voc, at Curtis Tufts.

842
01:03:21,064 --> 01:03:28,266
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it comes to community service, when it comes to giving back to our community, it is truly inspirational.

843
01:03:28,486 --> 01:03:40,290
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's, you know, the perseverance and the values of the class of 2022 are something that even us as adults in society can learn from.

844
01:03:41,005 --> 01:03:52,634
[SPEAKER_01]: And truly, I think it lends, I think lends some gravitas to the idea that we should have students that inspire us in this, aspire to be great.

845
01:03:52,814 --> 01:03:55,676
[SPEAKER_01]: And truly, I think this class has done it.

846
01:03:57,397 --> 01:03:58,198
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Councilor Sang.

847
01:03:59,098 --> 01:03:59,779
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Kerriolo.

848
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:01,700
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

849
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:03,782
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, thank you, Councilor Lai for putting this forward.

850
01:04:04,542 --> 01:04:07,224
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, I think everyone's said it eloquently.

851
01:04:07,284 --> 01:04:09,286
[SPEAKER_16]: We want to thank the graduating class

852
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:12,001
[SPEAKER_16]: Wish them good luck in all their future endeavors.

853
01:04:12,722 --> 01:04:13,963
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Councilor Caravaglio.

854
01:04:14,483 --> 01:04:20,048
[SPEAKER_19]: And I will just note for the audience that Councilor Seng is a class of 22 member from Harvard University, not Medford High School.

855
01:04:21,630 --> 01:04:22,410
[SPEAKER_19]: Congratulations.

856
01:04:24,712 --> 01:04:25,773
[SPEAKER_19]: Harvard University.

857
01:04:27,935 --> 01:04:28,656
[SPEAKER_19]: College, right?

858
01:04:28,836 --> 01:04:29,837
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, God.

859
01:04:30,837 --> 01:04:31,858
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, Harvard, right?

860
01:04:35,310 --> 01:04:38,611
[SPEAKER_19]: Congratulations to the class of 22, wherever they may be graduating from.

861
01:04:39,311 --> 01:04:41,212
[SPEAKER_19]: The motion of Councilor Seng seconded by.

862
01:04:43,392 --> 01:04:45,133
[SPEAKER_19]: Seconded by Councilor Collins.

863
01:04:45,313 --> 01:04:45,953
[SPEAKER_19]: All those in favor?

864
01:04:47,013 --> 01:04:47,654
[SPEAKER_19]: All those opposed?

865
01:04:47,954 --> 01:04:49,834
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion passes.

866
01:04:53,235 --> 01:04:55,336
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, was it Councilor Nielsen?

867
01:04:55,476 --> 01:04:56,076
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, geez.

868
01:04:56,336 --> 01:04:57,176
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, cause we're going to council.

869
01:04:57,236 --> 01:04:57,756
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry.

870
01:04:58,757 --> 01:04:59,277
[SPEAKER_19]: My bad.

871
01:05:01,477 --> 01:05:01,898
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

872
01:05:01,938 --> 01:05:02,438
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I'm not off.

873
01:05:05,027 --> 01:05:07,248
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not up here very often, I got ahead of myself.

874
01:05:08,068 --> 01:05:09,229
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry about that.

875
01:05:09,249 --> 01:05:16,692
[SPEAKER_19]: 22-373 offered by councilor saying, be it resolved that the Medford City Council recognize Pride Month and affirm its support of the LGBTQ plus community.

876
01:05:16,732 --> 01:05:17,352
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor saying.

877
01:05:17,927 --> 01:05:20,448
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Vice President Behrs.

878
01:05:20,648 --> 01:05:26,951
[SPEAKER_01]: The Pride Month is a month of celebration for our LGBTQ plus community here in Medford.

879
01:05:27,391 --> 01:05:37,695
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a month where members of our community can feel open to celebrate their identities, open to be bold about who they are and be truthful to themselves.

880
01:05:39,336 --> 01:05:49,338
[SPEAKER_01]: Our city this year is putting on a month-long celebration of Pride with tons of programming, which I suggest that our residents check out online.

881
01:05:50,618 --> 01:05:59,220
[SPEAKER_01]: The Pride Planning Committee in particular, I think, deserves some commendation for the amount of work and planning that they've put towards our Pride Month celebration.

882
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:03,241
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this resolution is our little bit here on City Council to celebrate.

883
01:06:04,001 --> 01:06:05,101
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Councilor Sang.

884
01:06:05,562 --> 01:06:07,142
[SPEAKER_19]: Any further comments from members of the Council?

885
01:06:09,651 --> 01:06:12,293
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion of Councillor Saint, seconded by Councillor Knight.

886
01:06:12,373 --> 01:06:16,497
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll just add that yes, there's a extensive list of events.

887
01:06:16,517 --> 01:06:17,698
[SPEAKER_19]: Some of them have already occurred.

888
01:06:17,758 --> 01:06:26,925
[SPEAKER_19]: I know that a lot of planning went into it and hopefully some of them will be a welcome respite from otherwise difficult budget conversations that we're gonna be having over the next few weeks.

889
01:06:27,606 --> 01:06:29,768
[SPEAKER_19]: On the motion of Councillor Saint, seconded by Councillor Knight.

890
01:06:29,808 --> 01:06:30,649
[SPEAKER_19]: All those in favor?

891
01:06:31,529 --> 01:06:32,230
[SPEAKER_19]: All those opposed?

892
01:06:33,511 --> 01:06:34,332
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion passes.

893
01:06:39,017 --> 01:06:51,684
[SPEAKER_19]: 22 dash 374 offered by counselor night being so resolved the city administration installed digital messaging boards in our public parks to display city notices field rental permits schedules and other neighborhood information counselor night.

894
01:06:53,445 --> 01:06:54,605
[SPEAKER_21]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

895
01:06:54,725 --> 01:07:01,389
[SPEAKER_21]: A couple weeks ago I was up at the little league field and the Red Sox were playing the Dodgers it was a great game.

896
01:07:02,019 --> 01:07:07,705
[SPEAKER_20]: And as I was walking the field with my wife, I was approached by a couple of staff members from our recreation department.

897
01:07:07,765 --> 01:07:11,728
[SPEAKER_20]: And they were having a difficult time because they had pulled permits for an adaptive kickball league.

898
01:07:12,489 --> 01:07:15,492
[SPEAKER_20]: And the baseball, one of the baseball teams was using the field permit.

899
01:07:16,077 --> 01:07:29,805
[SPEAKER_20]: And this turned into a little bit of a what was that word you used earlier kerfuffle kerfuffle turn into a little bit of a kerfuffle and as I thought about it and I walked around the community and I look at our business districts I see these what are they called so five boards or Sophie messaging boards.

900
01:07:30,685 --> 01:07:40,071
[SPEAKER_20]: And I thought it might make a lot of sense to see if we can install those in our public parks, so that we can put community notices up there I mean ultimately when you drive by our parks on a Saturday you'll see a place that park pack of soccer players.

901
01:07:40,691 --> 01:07:43,133
[SPEAKER_20]: They'll go by Drainfield, you'll see baseball players there all the time.

902
01:07:43,534 --> 01:07:46,216
[SPEAKER_20]: You go up to the Field of Dreams and you'll see lacrosse players up there all day long.

903
01:07:46,896 --> 01:08:05,131
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think it might make sense, Mr. President, as a way for us to expand the reach of our community notices, but also create some awareness about the permitting process, when the fields are available, who's gonna be using them, to take some of the confusion out of the game and to prevent kerfuffles like the one we've seen just a couple of weeks ago.

904
01:08:06,852 --> 01:08:07,512
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

905
01:08:07,553 --> 01:08:08,253
[SPEAKER_19]: Any further comments?

906
01:08:09,872 --> 01:08:14,178
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking of certain night for putting this on the agenda I want to set second this motion, the motion to approve.

907
01:08:16,781 --> 01:08:23,064
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Councilor Knight touched on it, but we do have a little bit of an information disconnect in our community.

908
01:08:23,104 --> 01:08:29,488
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this is one of many ways, but a great way that we can start to bridge that divide in our community.

909
01:08:30,488 --> 01:08:32,709
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone uses our parks, right?

910
01:08:32,729 --> 01:08:36,491
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go there for walks, new residents, longtime residents, everyone uses it.

911
01:08:37,291 --> 01:08:44,555
[SPEAKER_01]: To have that as a medium for us to disseminate information, I think would be very useful and very helpful.

912
01:08:45,111 --> 01:08:46,414
[SPEAKER_19]: Great, thank you, Councilor Sang.

913
01:08:46,895 --> 01:08:47,756
[SPEAKER_19]: Any further discussion?

914
01:08:47,776 --> 01:08:51,223
[SPEAKER_19]: On the motion of Councilor Nights, seconded by Councilor Sang.

915
01:08:51,343 --> 01:08:52,085
[SPEAKER_19]: All those in favor?

916
01:08:52,105 --> 01:08:53,908
[SPEAKER_19]: All those opposed?

917
01:08:55,151 --> 01:08:55,872
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion passes.

918
01:08:57,947 --> 01:09:11,510
[SPEAKER_19]: 22 dash 375 offered by counselor night being so resolved that the city solicitor provide the council with a draft ordinance requiring the city administration to present the city council with a review of the word articles on a monthly basis with a timely resolution counselor night, Mr. President, thank you very much.

919
01:09:11,570 --> 01:09:16,932
[SPEAKER_20]: If you take a look at our agenda, and we go to reports doing deadlines, you'll see paper 23039.

920
01:09:19,532 --> 01:09:24,834
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sorry, paper 22027, a monthly copy of the Warren articles from the chief financial officer.

921
01:09:24,914 --> 01:09:27,594
[SPEAKER_20]: Now that was paper 27 from this term, right?

922
01:09:27,614 --> 01:09:32,756
[SPEAKER_20]: So that must have been in the first two or three meetings, requesting that we get copies of the Warren articles each week, each month.

923
01:09:33,136 --> 01:09:36,397
[SPEAKER_20]: And the Warren articles are actually where our money's going, where our bills are being spent.

924
01:09:36,837 --> 01:09:42,779
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, so we pass a budget and the budget says this is what the bills are gonna be, but the Warren articles are actually where we are spending our money.

925
01:09:42,799 --> 01:09:48,120
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think it's very important that the council sees that information, especially based upon the financial mess that we're in right now.

926
01:09:48,868 --> 01:10:11,434
[SPEAKER_20]: So after two and a half years of begging for this information and having to get it in dribs and drabs and spatterings from the administration when they felt like giving it to us, I felt as though it was time for us, in order to really solidify our position here as being financial watchdogs in this community, that this information be solidified in the form of an ordinance so that it's not so mysterious and hard for us to get.

927
01:10:12,255 --> 01:10:13,335
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, our new CFO,

928
01:10:14,349 --> 01:10:22,102
[SPEAKER_20]: was very gracious and made it sound like this is a public document which I agree with them it is, and then it would be no problem for us to get them and I don't think it should be either.

929
01:10:22,502 --> 01:10:28,953
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's what our previous CFOs and previous chief of staffs have all said as well, but for some reason I still haven't seen one and I can't tell you how long

930
01:10:29,806 --> 01:10:43,095
[SPEAKER_20]: So with that being said, I think it's time that we we codify this to make it so that it's an official function of the position, so that they actually have to send it to us on a monthly basis as a requirement to their job, so that we have the information that we need to make informed decisions on behalf of the taxpayers.

931
01:10:43,435 --> 01:10:43,795
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

932
01:10:43,996 --> 01:10:45,737
[SPEAKER_19]: I guess this will be our one ordinance of the year.

933
01:10:46,297 --> 01:10:47,458
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, Councilor Collins.

934
01:10:49,237 --> 01:10:50,377
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Vice President Barrett.

935
01:10:50,417 --> 01:10:51,798
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Nye, for putting this forward.

936
01:10:51,818 --> 01:10:53,358
[SPEAKER_15]: I was happy to see this on the agenda.

937
01:10:54,059 --> 01:11:04,222
[SPEAKER_15]: I think this is, you know, obviously just the type of structure that we all want to be seeing and, you know, our conversation starting at 5.30 just shored up how critical it is for us to be getting much more regular

938
01:11:04,862 --> 01:11:19,095
[SPEAKER_15]: communications, you know, and as the term goes on, my belief strengthens that, you know, the way to make sure we see something is to put it in an ordinance, even if the path to getting it there is more difficult than it should be given the resources at our disposal.

939
01:11:19,915 --> 01:11:21,457
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, I think this goes for other

940
01:11:22,477 --> 01:11:35,684
[SPEAKER_15]: this is not just for this administration or this term, it's a way to declare this is just how it should be going forward, not contingent on any administration or any council CFO relationship, it's just how it should be.

941
01:11:36,485 --> 01:11:38,786
[SPEAKER_15]: So I was glad to see this on the agenda and I appreciate you putting it forward.

942
01:11:40,447 --> 01:11:41,167
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

943
01:11:41,207 --> 01:11:41,728
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyone else?

944
01:11:43,829 --> 01:11:46,370
[SPEAKER_19]: Seeing none, on the motion of Councilor Nights, seconded by Councilor Collins.

945
01:11:46,410 --> 01:11:47,171
[SPEAKER_19]: All those in favor?

946
01:11:47,191 --> 01:11:48,491
[SPEAKER_19]: All those opposed?

947
01:11:49,092 --> 01:11:49,752
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion passes.

948
01:11:49,812 --> 01:11:51,373
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to turn it back over to President Morrell.

949
01:11:53,510 --> 01:11:54,231
[SPEAKER_19]: And we're withdrawing 22-376.

950
01:12:24,787 --> 01:12:27,091
[SPEAKER_14]: Paper 22-376 was withdrawn.

951
01:12:27,131 --> 01:12:31,037
[SPEAKER_14]: So moving on to 22-377 offered by Councillor Collins.

952
01:12:31,758 --> 01:12:37,246
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it so resolved that the subcommittee on housing need to discuss the proposed housing stability notification ordinance.

953
01:12:37,366 --> 01:12:38,088
[SPEAKER_14]: Councillor Collins.

954
01:12:38,526 --> 01:12:39,407
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, President Morrell.

955
01:12:39,447 --> 01:12:47,953
[SPEAKER_15]: So this is my attempt to resurface a paper that was put forth by former Councilor Falco in February of 2021.

956
01:12:47,993 --> 01:12:52,877
[SPEAKER_15]: It was referred to the subcommittee on the elderly and housing.

957
01:12:53,738 --> 01:13:00,543
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just wanted to add this to the lengthening queue of projects that will undergo in subcommittee and the housing subcommittee in particular.

958
01:13:01,884 --> 01:13:03,785
[SPEAKER_15]: I've felt it's important for a long time.

959
01:13:03,865 --> 01:13:10,369
[SPEAKER_15]: For a long time, I've been excited for us to draft a proposed ordinance around the idea of housing stability communications.

960
01:13:11,150 --> 01:13:20,316
[SPEAKER_15]: And the events in this community of the past three months have unfortunately only solidified my sense of the urgency for this.

961
01:13:20,616 --> 01:13:29,002
[SPEAKER_15]: In the past two weeks, I've heard of two separate buildings, not including the one that we all heard from in person in March that are

962
01:13:29,862 --> 01:13:35,367
[SPEAKER_15]: encountering landlord-tenant strife, where there are potential issues of tenant exploitation.

963
01:13:36,808 --> 01:13:47,897
[SPEAKER_15]: And regardless of the circumstances and the outcomes of those particular cases, what that says to me is we need to have, we need to set up a system in our community

964
01:13:48,778 --> 01:14:00,202
[SPEAKER_15]: like those that exist in other communities where when a landlord-tenant relationship is established, the rights and the resources and the rules that govern that relationship are made clearly known to both parties.

965
01:14:01,102 --> 01:14:05,404
[SPEAKER_15]: This type of ordinance can be tailored however we see fit.

966
01:14:05,564 --> 01:14:08,385
[SPEAKER_15]: I know some communities set it up so that

967
01:14:09,325 --> 01:14:18,093
[SPEAKER_15]: When a lease comes to an end, a tenant receives a city-approved memo on things you should know when you're terminating your lease in other communities.

968
01:14:18,173 --> 01:14:31,044
[SPEAKER_15]: It's that, as well as within 30 days of moving in, your landlord has to provide a city-approved memo on your rights and resources as a tenant in your language spoken at home within a month of moving in.

969
01:14:31,124 --> 01:14:34,327
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just a great way to make sure that everybody is on the same page

970
01:14:34,827 --> 01:14:37,931
[SPEAKER_15]: and knows everything that they should know to be empowered in that relationship.

971
01:14:38,853 --> 01:14:48,526
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think that this is something, I don't think that this should be a big lift for our city, and I'm excited to discuss it further when the housing subcommittee is able to get around to it.

972
01:14:48,546 --> 01:14:50,389
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

973
01:14:50,469 --> 01:14:51,130
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Behrs.

974
01:14:51,717 --> 01:14:52,697
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Madam President.

975
01:14:52,737 --> 01:14:53,557
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Councilor Gonza.

976
01:14:53,577 --> 01:14:57,278
[SPEAKER_19]: I look forward to hopefully scheduling this meeting soon.

977
01:14:57,578 --> 01:15:04,160
[SPEAKER_19]: And I just wanna thank, I believe Councilor Falco actually was the initial sponsor of this ordinance in 2021.

978
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:11,521
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think it was incredibly relevant then as we were looking at it relative to the pandemic.

979
01:15:11,781 --> 01:15:19,063
[SPEAKER_19]: And now as we are seeing those protections go away, as well as the ongoing market issues and housing crisis.

980
01:15:20,347 --> 01:15:23,130
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's really, this could have helped people.

981
01:15:24,312 --> 01:15:28,797
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think if we can move it quickly, it would be of help to people in the future.

982
01:15:29,098 --> 01:15:29,398
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

983
01:15:33,122 --> 01:15:37,144
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with my fellow fellow counselors that this has to be a top priority for our council.

984
01:15:37,525 --> 01:15:44,348
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, as my fellow counselors alluded to, we're already seeing the effects of not having moved on this quick enough.

985
01:15:45,608 --> 01:16:00,235
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we need in a lot of that's due to the lack of resources that we find ourselves with, you know, with the attitude that we're supposed to be passing one ordinance a year, you know, that's just not reality and the funding that we have for

986
01:16:01,376 --> 01:16:11,505
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, for legal help does not does not, you know, may makes us have to pick and choose, but I agree with my colleagues that this has to be pushed to the front of the agenda.

987
01:16:12,806 --> 01:16:22,694
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something that I think many of us ran on in the last election, it's something that we had definitely, we have a very clear mandate for and I think something that our residents in our city are begging for.

988
01:16:23,835 --> 01:16:24,536
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

989
01:16:24,576 --> 01:16:29,420
[SPEAKER_14]: Any further discussion on the motion of Councilor Collins seconded by

990
01:16:31,631 --> 01:16:32,796
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Sang, all those in favor?

991
01:16:32,816 --> 01:16:34,302
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

992
01:16:34,342 --> 01:16:35,065
[SPEAKER_14]: The motion passes.

993
01:16:37,578 --> 01:16:39,960
[SPEAKER_14]: 22-378 offered by Vice President Fares and Councilor Knight.

994
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:52,690
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it so resolved by the Medford City Council that the city clerk create an internal office process and a shared spreadsheet for tracking requests by the city council to the administration and or state agencies and their responses.

995
01:16:53,270 --> 01:17:01,877
[SPEAKER_14]: The spreadsheet would include the date, paper number, resolution language, requested deadline for response, if any, and link to a copy of the response if received.

996
01:17:02,457 --> 01:17:08,339
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it further resolved that the City Council meet in Committee of the Whole to discuss this process with the City Clerk and needed staff.

997
01:17:08,859 --> 01:17:17,681
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it further resolved that beginning in September 2022, the City Council will hold monthly Committee of the Whole meetings to review responses and outstanding requests.

998
01:17:18,681 --> 01:17:19,501
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Bears.

999
01:17:20,202 --> 01:17:20,822
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight.

1000
01:17:22,420 --> 01:17:26,724
[SPEAKER_20]: I feel like an old man now like the senior member over here for a minute of console caviar.

1001
01:17:27,385 --> 01:17:36,133
[SPEAKER_20]: So, Madam President, this was an idea rather came up in conversation with console beers and I ultimately when you take a look at the resolutions that this council passes.

1002
01:17:36,774 --> 01:17:45,022
[SPEAKER_20]: We pass a resolution and we send it to the administration and the administration supposed to respond to us within a specified timeframe is outlined in the city charter I believe it's seven to 10 days.

1003
01:17:45,827 --> 01:17:58,680
[SPEAKER_20]: If you take a look at the last six council packets that we have, you'll see that there's not one response to one council resolution in any one of those six packets, and that covers a span of six weeks so I think that's a little bit longer than seven to 10 days.

1004
01:17:59,821 --> 01:18:03,384
[SPEAKER_20]: So, my thinking behind this was that, you know, we need to take a look at.

1005
01:18:04,398 --> 01:18:09,481
[SPEAKER_20]: work product that we're putting out, not necessarily just the talk that we're talking, we need to walk the walk as well.

1006
01:18:10,161 --> 01:18:28,572
[SPEAKER_20]: And when we decided that the best use of our time would be in the committee process and committees as a whole and like one of the things that I always felt was lacking was our follow up on the items that left the council floor items that were on the agenda that left the council floor that went across the hall of the administration.

1007
01:18:28,942 --> 01:18:32,285
[SPEAKER_20]: If the administration doesn't respond what's the follow up right there's no follow up.

1008
01:18:32,785 --> 01:18:47,096
[SPEAKER_20]: So I thought this was a good way for us to keep track of some of the things that we're trying to do to make a difference in this community and also hold the administration accountable to the regulatory confines that have been established for us to work harmoniously.

1009
01:18:48,590 --> 01:18:55,897
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think that this is a step in the right direction for us to be a little bit more transparent to show what it is we're looking for what it is we're asking for and how we want to do it.

1010
01:18:56,517 --> 01:19:02,442
[SPEAKER_20]: And it also gives the administration the opportunity to say look at this is what's going on this is what we're doing, and this is why we can or can't.

1011
01:19:03,403 --> 01:19:05,085
[SPEAKER_20]: So ultimately I think this is a great idea.

1012
01:19:06,986 --> 01:19:09,788
[SPEAKER_20]: Council tracking sheet that the city clerk maintains already.

1013
01:19:10,408 --> 01:19:16,351
[SPEAKER_20]: This might take a little bit more updating and maybe bringing into sign of the times but I think this is a great idea.

1014
01:19:16,711 --> 01:19:33,800
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'd like to actually see it on the reports to section of our agenda weekly so that when you look at our agenda every week we'll say, you know, Council paper to 2001 was this past outstanding papers only be included on the agenda something like that some, some of the items that we can hash out another committee of the whole.

1015
01:19:34,377 --> 01:19:38,518
[SPEAKER_20]: But I think it's certainly a step in the right direction for us to be a little bit more transparent to show the work that we're doing.

1016
01:19:39,018 --> 01:19:42,439
[SPEAKER_20]: Because a lot of the work that we do doesn't necessarily take place on the council floor.

1017
01:19:42,799 --> 01:19:45,839
[SPEAKER_20]: It takes place outside of the council floor and we need to show that progress is being made.

1018
01:19:46,420 --> 01:19:47,160
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1019
01:19:47,180 --> 01:19:50,440
[SPEAKER_14]: Would that language around the reports too, would that be an amendment?

1020
01:19:51,261 --> 01:19:53,021
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1021
01:19:55,522 --> 01:19:55,802
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1022
01:19:56,062 --> 01:19:56,762
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Behrs.

1023
01:19:57,242 --> 01:19:58,302
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Madam President.

1024
01:19:58,322 --> 01:19:59,202
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1025
01:19:59,542 --> 01:20:02,183
[SPEAKER_19]: I think this is a great idea and I'm glad to be

1026
01:20:02,871 --> 01:20:04,853
[SPEAKER_19]: of some help in moving it forward.

1027
01:20:06,374 --> 01:20:13,821
[SPEAKER_19]: Quite frankly, I think, as we saw earlier tonight, there's a basic aversion to basic accountability currently happening in this building.

1028
01:20:15,882 --> 01:20:22,148
[SPEAKER_19]: Sure, there were different tones used, but I don't think anyone on this Council went beyond the pale of

1029
01:20:23,449 --> 01:20:33,478
[SPEAKER_19]: wanting basic information and requests that we ask of the administration to share with the public to be provided to us in a prompt and timely manner.

1030
01:20:34,138 --> 01:20:37,361
[SPEAKER_19]: It really is a question of basic due diligence.

1031
01:20:38,962 --> 01:20:46,989
[SPEAKER_19]: And from my personal feeling, basic respect for the city council as an elected body in the city of Medford.

1032
01:20:48,791 --> 01:20:50,672
[SPEAKER_19]: To be honest, I'm a little sad that it's come to this.

1033
01:20:51,687 --> 01:21:00,476
[SPEAKER_19]: I do think that there are going to be a lot of procedural advantages to doing it this way, where you don't have to go and check in every time or try to keep track of your own papers at least.

1034
01:21:01,017 --> 01:21:08,204
[SPEAKER_19]: Now we'll have it all in one place you know there's plenty of stuff that Councilor Carviel has put forward that I've been interested in but I don't remember the paper number and he filed it.

1035
01:21:08,644 --> 01:21:14,811
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think there's a lot of synergy here that that is that is useful but I just think the fact that we're putting this forward.

1036
01:21:16,196 --> 01:21:27,906
[SPEAKER_19]: not just as a common sense reform that we could do at any time, but very specifically because we're not receiving communications and responses in a prompt and timely manner is truly sad.

1037
01:21:28,886 --> 01:21:31,248
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm glad we're gonna do this.

1038
01:21:31,409 --> 01:21:32,289
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's a good idea.

1039
01:21:32,309 --> 01:21:41,176
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it would be a good idea under any circumstances, but under these circumstances, I think it's not just a good idea, but us doing our basic due diligence.

1040
01:21:42,310 --> 01:21:45,012
[SPEAKER_19]: to let the public know, hey, we're asking the questions.

1041
01:21:45,072 --> 01:21:46,173
[SPEAKER_19]: We're just not getting the answers.

1042
01:21:46,833 --> 01:21:47,174
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1043
01:21:47,934 --> 01:21:48,875
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, vice and bears.

1044
01:21:48,955 --> 01:21:54,979
[SPEAKER_14]: Any further discussion on the emotion of counts for nights seconded by vice and bears.

1045
01:21:55,019 --> 01:21:55,680
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor.

1046
01:21:56,723 --> 01:21:58,284
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed, the motion passes.

1047
01:21:58,304 --> 01:22:02,465
[SPEAKER_14]: 22-379 offered by Councilor Seng and Councilor Collins.

1048
01:22:03,065 --> 01:22:23,272
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it resolved by the Medford City Council that an ordinance be discussed in subcommittee, which would secure the rights of individuals seeking gender affirming care and forbid the city of Medford and municipal entities from assisting out of state requests for civil or criminal action against those who allow a person, whether child or adult to receive gender affirming care or those who seek gender affirming care themselves.

1049
01:22:23,993 --> 01:22:24,433
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Seng.

1050
01:22:24,862 --> 01:22:26,484
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, President Morrell.

1051
01:22:27,125 --> 01:22:34,774
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a proactive measure that we can take to protect our most vulnerable populations, given developing political trends in other states.

1052
01:22:36,216 --> 01:22:41,002
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I think this response to a very likely what if, if

1053
01:22:41,843 --> 01:22:54,470
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, young, long-time Medford resident moves out of state and comes back here for this type of care, you know, this offers them that peace of mind, that safety that they would want.

1054
01:22:55,710 --> 01:23:07,897
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something that is very actionable because we already have draft language, and we would be joining a community of Boston-area cities and towns that are putting this into action, and I wouldn't want Medford to miss out on it.

1055
01:23:09,358 --> 01:23:22,830
[SPEAKER_01]: The draft language I was told recently also includes reproductive health care and protection for those seeking reproductive health care, which we know now is at stake in our country, very unfortunately.

1056
01:23:23,270 --> 01:23:34,320
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I would also motion to amend after the references to gender affirming care, just to add in, and reproductive health care in this resolution.

1057
01:23:36,157 --> 01:23:50,973
[SPEAKER_01]: The most important message I can say about this resolution is that this is a way to level, let us as a council and as a city, live our values and celebrate our values that we affirmed earlier tonight with the resolution celebrating Pride Month.

1058
01:23:52,134 --> 01:23:56,719
[SPEAKER_01]: We, as a community Medford stands for stands for everyone.

1059
01:23:57,279 --> 01:24:01,242
[SPEAKER_01]: we stand against bigotry and we stand for peace of mind and safety.

1060
01:24:01,763 --> 01:24:06,247
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, you know, this isn't these questions are matters of public health.

1061
01:24:06,347 --> 01:24:08,108
[SPEAKER_01]: They're matters of community safety.

1062
01:24:08,849 --> 01:24:14,694
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um I think this would be an important resolution for us to take on tonight.

1063
01:24:15,594 --> 01:24:16,315
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Sang.

1064
01:24:16,335 --> 01:24:17,035
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Collins.

1065
01:24:17,956 --> 01:24:18,717
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, President Morrell.

1066
01:24:18,737 --> 01:24:24,201
[SPEAKER_15]: And I thank my Councilor Sang for working with me on this idea.

1067
01:24:24,221 --> 01:24:25,763
[SPEAKER_15]: I think when it comes to, um

1068
01:24:27,921 --> 01:24:46,296
[SPEAKER_15]: the general topic of, you know, we're in a national moment where in some parts of the nation, the civil liberties of the LGBTQ plus community, including those seeking gender affirming care, those civil liberties are being questioned, they're being threatened, they're being attacked.

1069
01:24:46,777 --> 01:24:53,142
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think this is the moment in which, you know, the failure to be proactive is actually regressive.

1070
01:24:55,017 --> 01:25:07,094
[SPEAKER_15]: know, the anti-LGBTQ plus operatives in our more conservative parts of the nation, they want our neighbors seeking gender affirming care to feel isolated and atomized.

1071
01:25:07,534 --> 01:25:11,900
[SPEAKER_15]: That is their political angle, that is their power play, so we have an opportunity to

1072
01:25:14,026 --> 01:25:16,727
[SPEAKER_15]: distort that narrative by promising safety.

1073
01:25:17,328 --> 01:25:24,192
[SPEAKER_15]: That is how we can be an ally to our neighbors and other parts of the nation and stand against these threats to civil liberties.

1074
01:25:24,573 --> 01:25:29,356
[SPEAKER_15]: And I also want to note, you know, there's precedent for this sort of ordinance, this sort of resolution.

1075
01:25:29,376 --> 01:25:36,561
[SPEAKER_15]: The Medford Police Department entered into a commitment of non-compliance between the police department and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

1076
01:25:37,001 --> 01:25:40,964
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's, I feel like there within our community and others, there's broad precedent for

1077
01:25:42,304 --> 01:25:47,888
[SPEAKER_15]: standing up for protection of rights where we have jurisdiction to do so.

1078
01:25:48,649 --> 01:25:52,952
[SPEAKER_15]: And I respectfully ask for the support of our colleagues and discussing this ordinance.

1079
01:25:53,592 --> 01:25:54,493
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

1080
01:25:54,653 --> 01:25:55,373
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Behrs.

1081
01:25:55,714 --> 01:25:56,634
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Madam President.

1082
01:25:56,914 --> 01:26:00,217
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Councilor Stang and Councilor Collins for putting this forward.

1083
01:26:02,138 --> 01:26:07,402
[SPEAKER_19]: There's some incredibly dark and twisted forces at work in this country.

1084
01:26:08,660 --> 01:26:18,748
[SPEAKER_19]: seeking to impose their will on others, to deny basic medical services and care to people of all stripes.

1085
01:26:18,808 --> 01:26:25,033
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, this is fundamentally about our basic freedoms and our basic liberties as people in the United States.

1086
01:26:26,254 --> 01:26:33,080
[SPEAKER_19]: These folks and their big dark money are spending millions and millions and millions of dollars

1087
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:40,267
[SPEAKER_19]: to abuse and misread and twist the United States Constitution to the point of saying that a parent

1088
01:26:42,228 --> 01:26:52,835
[SPEAKER_19]: cannot provide basic medical care that their doctor says is necessary to their own child, that an individual person and their doctor cannot make a decision about their own medical care.

1089
01:26:52,875 --> 01:27:00,380
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm grateful to hear that reproductive health is going to be included in this ordinance, because that was what I was going to add to amend here.

1090
01:27:01,161 --> 01:27:06,825
[SPEAKER_19]: This is fundamentally about the most human right of all, the right to control your own body, the right to control

1091
01:27:07,527 --> 01:27:24,030
[SPEAKER_19]: your own medical care, and the just deeply shameful, shameful movement to destroy that freedom, to destroy our constitution, and to take away some of the most basic of rights must be opposed at every level.

1092
01:27:24,650 --> 01:27:36,732
[SPEAKER_19]: The idea that a parent trying to get care for their child, having to flee their own state and come here to get that care, and then being treated like a fugitive, asking us to report them

1093
01:27:38,102 --> 01:27:45,726
[SPEAKER_19]: report them so they can face criminal action when they return home is disgusting.

1094
01:27:47,667 --> 01:28:07,456
[SPEAKER_19]: And if we can even play a small part, if we can even help one person feel welcomed and safe and understanding that here in the city of Medford and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, that we still believe in the constitution and the basic American values of the right to choose and the right to control your own body and the right to liberty,

1095
01:28:09,168 --> 01:28:28,417
[SPEAKER_19]: and the right to just be accepted and live your life and make what is an incredibly, any medical decision is difficult, make an incredibly difficult decision without worrying about the watchful eye of some overlord who says what you can do and you can do and you can do and you can't do with your body.

1096
01:28:30,181 --> 01:28:51,205
[SPEAKER_19]: I think we should do it so I'm very thankful for you for putting this forward and I just can't even begin to speak to the completely anti democratic anti populist anti, you know, 70% of people in this country are saying what's going on here is completely wrong, but we're going to have a Supreme Court got it all.

1097
01:28:52,540 --> 01:29:00,982
[SPEAKER_19]: a Supreme Court that that isn't even justly appointed a Supreme Court that, you know, is appointed by hundreds of millions of dollars of dark money, it's just wrong.

1098
01:29:01,142 --> 01:29:07,084
[SPEAKER_19]: So if we can do anything I think we should I would move to refer this to the public health and community safety subcommittee.

1099
01:29:07,124 --> 01:29:07,504
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1100
01:29:09,285 --> 01:29:10,685
[SPEAKER_14]: Any further discussion from counselors.

1101
01:29:11,845 --> 01:29:17,147
[SPEAKER_14]: If I could briefly from the chair, I want to thank Councilor saying and Councilor Collins for bringing this forward and Councilor saying for making that amendment.

1102
01:29:18,001 --> 01:29:22,986
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Collins, I think you really hit the nail on the head where to do nothing at this point would be regressive.

1103
01:29:23,266 --> 01:29:28,010
[SPEAKER_14]: I understand that, you know, people may say, this is not a city level issue, why are you discussing this?

1104
01:29:28,070 --> 01:29:40,221
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think we're seeing across the country, we're seeing multiple states turn to policy by way of bounty hunters to enact policy by putting bounties on those seeking reproductive care, seeking gender affirming care.

1105
01:29:40,621 --> 01:29:43,464
[SPEAKER_14]: And I agree with Vice President Bears, if there is anything we can do at the city level,

1106
01:29:44,090 --> 01:29:47,032
[SPEAKER_14]: we absolutely need to do it to protect our residents.

1107
01:29:47,212 --> 01:29:50,775
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's what's right, it's what's just, and to do nothing would be regressive.

1108
01:29:50,895 --> 01:29:52,156
[SPEAKER_14]: So I thank you for bringing this forward.

1109
01:29:53,677 --> 01:29:56,980
[SPEAKER_14]: Name and address for the record, please.

1110
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,381
[SPEAKER_17]: 61 Locust Street, Method Mass.

1111
01:30:00,282 --> 01:30:06,287
[SPEAKER_17]: I take exception to that bill or whatever you guys are trying to do with it.

1112
01:30:06,307 --> 01:30:08,809
[SPEAKER_17]: And the reason I take exception is why are children?

1113
01:30:10,830 --> 01:30:11,671
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just curious.

1114
01:30:12,311 --> 01:30:13,152
[SPEAKER_17]: Can someone tell me?

1115
01:30:13,962 --> 01:30:18,266
[SPEAKER_17]: Why children are on here?

1116
01:30:18,326 --> 01:30:23,030
[SPEAKER_17]: Does this mean that a 12 year old can go do what they want without parent's permission?

1117
01:30:23,130 --> 01:30:29,155
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just, I'm asking.

1118
01:30:29,175 --> 01:30:32,477
[SPEAKER_14]: If you'd like the council to speak, they can respond.

1119
01:30:33,538 --> 01:30:41,265
[SPEAKER_19]: You're always very curious and I appreciate your curiosity, but this is not allowing 12 year olds to do whatever.

1120
01:30:41,285 --> 01:30:42,486
[SPEAKER_19]: This is medical science.

1121
01:30:44,067 --> 01:30:45,388
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, it most certainly is.

1122
01:30:46,329 --> 01:30:47,189
[SPEAKER_19]: It most certainly is.

1123
01:30:48,711 --> 01:30:49,771
[SPEAKER_19]: This is about medical science.

1124
01:30:49,791 --> 01:30:53,194
[SPEAKER_19]: This is about doctors and families making decisions.

1125
01:30:53,874 --> 01:30:56,156
[SPEAKER_19]: And I don't think that anyone should be getting in the way of that.

1126
01:30:56,596 --> 01:31:04,022
[SPEAKER_17]: This, this is a serious, serious, very serious issue that's going on right now.

1127
01:31:04,542 --> 01:31:07,365
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry, if I may, I just want to, I want to.

1128
01:31:10,849 --> 01:31:18,552
[SPEAKER_15]: to go back to the text of the resolution, this would forbid the city of Medford and municipal entities not to recommend or provide any medical care at all.

1129
01:31:18,632 --> 01:31:20,734
[SPEAKER_15]: Obviously that is not what we do at this municipality.

1130
01:31:21,174 --> 01:31:29,938
[SPEAKER_15]: What this does is forbid us from assisting out of state requests for civil or criminal action against those who are seeking that type of care.

1131
01:31:29,958 --> 01:31:39,403
[SPEAKER_15]: So that is simply saying we will not participate in bounty hunter programs to keep additional legal trouble upon people who are trying to make

1132
01:31:40,146 --> 01:31:41,907
[SPEAKER_15]: medical decisions for themselves.

1133
01:31:41,987 --> 01:31:43,567
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to clarify that point.

1134
01:31:45,408 --> 01:31:49,490
[SPEAKER_17]: We want to secure the rights of individuals seeking gender affirming care.

1135
01:31:51,211 --> 01:31:55,913
[SPEAKER_17]: So you're telling me that if someone from another state, is this what this is for?

1136
01:31:56,033 --> 01:32:05,637
[SPEAKER_17]: If they can't get gender affirming care in another state, they can come here and they're going to be able to get it here, but they can't get it in another state.

1137
01:32:06,157 --> 01:32:07,858
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just not aware of any state

1138
01:32:08,841 --> 01:32:09,941
[SPEAKER_17]: that doesn't allow this.

1139
01:32:10,321 --> 01:32:11,141
[SPEAKER_19]: Point of information.

1140
01:32:13,662 --> 01:32:38,327
[SPEAKER_19]: In Texas recently, their attorney general, and I won't get into the fact that he's been under indictment for eight years, but their attorney general issued an order that said that the Department of Social Services should investigate families, potentially take away kids for getting this kind of medical care as recommended, you know, as discussed by the doctor.

1141
01:32:39,081 --> 01:32:46,424
[SPEAKER_19]: the Attorney General of Texas was ordering social services to investigate families and potentially take away their children.

1142
01:32:47,124 --> 01:33:00,468
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, if someone came here to get that care, because it sounds like Texas isn't a very favorable place, this would say, well, we're not going to tell you what kind of care they got, A, because it's medical privacy.

1143
01:33:00,628 --> 01:33:04,070
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think we've had quite a few discussions about medical privacy over the past three years.

1144
01:33:05,530 --> 01:33:10,214
[SPEAKER_19]: But it says, we're not gonna report you to the cops in Texas so they can take away your kid.

1145
01:33:11,334 --> 01:33:11,935
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what it says.

1146
01:33:12,535 --> 01:33:14,957
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just gonna, let me just say this, okay?

1147
01:33:15,057 --> 01:33:22,203
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think that anyone understands, really, really understands the seriousness of this, that's all.

1148
01:33:23,264 --> 01:33:23,704
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, no, no.

1149
01:33:23,724 --> 01:33:25,405
[SPEAKER_17]: I think taking away children is incredibly serious.

1150
01:33:25,425 --> 01:33:27,627
[SPEAKER_17]: We're talking about children, okay?

1151
01:33:28,568 --> 01:33:28,928
[SPEAKER_17]: All right?

1152
01:33:30,389 --> 01:33:33,692
[SPEAKER_17]: You can go look at any study you want, all right?

1153
01:33:34,873 --> 01:33:41,037
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, Massachusetts in my day, okay, we were the first state to allow gay marriage.

1154
01:33:41,057 --> 01:33:42,337
[SPEAKER_17]: You're all aware of that, right?

1155
01:33:42,397 --> 01:33:46,040
[SPEAKER_17]: So when I was young, we fought for all kinds of stuff, okay?

1156
01:33:46,720 --> 01:34:00,568
[SPEAKER_17]: But when you're talking about children, all right, no one's brain or mind, the cortex, whatever you wanna call it, okay, is developed at 12 or 13 or 14 or 15, 16,

1157
01:34:04,545 --> 01:34:05,565
[SPEAKER_17]: you're not developed till 25.

1158
01:34:05,665 --> 01:34:10,646
[SPEAKER_17]: When we're young, we all make rash decisions.

1159
01:34:10,786 --> 01:34:14,687
[SPEAKER_17]: We make decisions that we regret later on in life.

1160
01:34:16,207 --> 01:34:18,547
[SPEAKER_17]: Hopefully they're small decisions that we made.

1161
01:34:18,587 --> 01:34:22,948
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe, you know, someone, a couple of my friends got tattoos when they were 18.

1162
01:34:23,188 --> 01:34:25,649
[SPEAKER_17]: They don't want those tattoos no more.

1163
01:34:25,689 --> 01:34:26,689
[SPEAKER_17]: Who wants an anchor?

1164
01:34:26,789 --> 01:34:28,469
[SPEAKER_17]: All the tattoos are all different now.

1165
01:34:28,889 --> 01:34:30,989
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's just a minor example.

1166
01:34:31,990 --> 01:34:33,350
[SPEAKER_17]: When you're talking about

1167
01:34:34,365 --> 01:34:38,328
[SPEAKER_17]: sex change and things like that, okay?

1168
01:34:39,288 --> 01:34:46,553
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, it's a very difficult, difficult process for these kids to go through.

1169
01:34:47,854 --> 01:34:50,196
[SPEAKER_17]: I have a lot of friends that went through this.

1170
01:34:51,897 --> 01:34:53,318
[SPEAKER_17]: I do, okay?

1171
01:34:54,659 --> 01:34:58,241
[SPEAKER_17]: They were given the opportunity to make the decision on their own.

1172
01:34:59,369 --> 01:35:07,591
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, politics and everything else in our school system, what's going on in our schools is wrong, okay?

1173
01:35:08,431 --> 01:35:10,851
[SPEAKER_17]: Kids need to figure it out on their own.

1174
01:35:11,831 --> 01:35:12,812
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what they need.

1175
01:35:13,612 --> 01:35:20,553
[SPEAKER_17]: They don't need us telling them, oh no, you come here and you can do the operation or you can do this or you can do that.

1176
01:35:20,853 --> 01:35:23,834
[SPEAKER_17]: The suicide rate for these kids is out of control.

1177
01:35:25,022 --> 01:35:28,506
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, I'm saying this because I really do care about this issue.

1178
01:35:28,766 --> 01:35:31,729
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, that's why I'm up here speaking, all right?

1179
01:35:32,630 --> 01:35:38,977
[SPEAKER_17]: And I can't understand how you could possibly include children in this.

1180
01:35:40,459 --> 01:35:45,284
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't care what you wanna call it, because I know how this happens and I know how it starts.

1181
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:53,666
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, it just goes from, oh, we're just doing this, but then, you know, whatever, next year we'll have something in the school.

1182
01:35:54,726 --> 01:35:57,488
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, a kid wants to do, it's happening now.

1183
01:35:58,769 --> 01:36:00,671
[SPEAKER_17]: They don't have to go see their parents.

1184
01:36:00,711 --> 01:36:02,072
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, it's not right.

1185
01:36:03,053 --> 01:36:05,915
[SPEAKER_17]: You're talking about, oh, the parent wants the kid to get it.

1186
01:36:05,955 --> 01:36:07,376
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a whole different story.

1187
01:36:10,370 --> 01:36:18,996
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm very concerned about the kid that's gonna go to whatever and be able to do whatever the hell he wants and he's 15 years old.

1188
01:36:20,297 --> 01:36:27,822
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, and then by the time the kid's 23, 24, 25, you know, it's a fact.

1189
01:36:28,343 --> 01:36:31,445
[SPEAKER_17]: I know a doctor that used to do these operations.

1190
01:36:32,966 --> 01:36:38,550
[SPEAKER_17]: He started doing them because he took an oath to help and to save people.

1191
01:36:40,038 --> 01:36:45,524
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not like you talk like it's this simple thing.

1192
01:36:45,684 --> 01:36:48,728
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, I wanna change my body.

1193
01:36:48,748 --> 01:36:49,909
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm this, I'm that.

1194
01:36:50,310 --> 01:36:51,451
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not simple.

1195
01:36:51,591 --> 01:36:53,193
[SPEAKER_17]: People suffer with this.

1196
01:36:56,077 --> 01:36:58,940
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Sang, Councilor Cohn's advice is embarrassing.

1197
01:36:59,437 --> 01:37:02,238
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they're done.

1198
01:37:02,338 --> 01:37:03,499
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you really do care.

1199
01:37:03,679 --> 01:37:09,162
[SPEAKER_01]: I really I know you really do care because Jack, who you know, I want to get into anything personal.

1200
01:37:09,362 --> 01:37:09,802
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1201
01:37:09,862 --> 01:37:12,063
[SPEAKER_17]: No, no, don't.

1202
01:37:12,503 --> 01:37:13,864
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, but but but the

1203
01:37:14,564 --> 01:37:27,587
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the issue at matter here isn't isn't what you're saying at all I mean it's, there's not making it will be it will be I'm telling you what our city is not going to pass an order telling people to be transgender.

1204
01:37:27,867 --> 01:37:28,987
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm fine.

1205
01:37:29,067 --> 01:37:39,289
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to calm down and I'm just going to walk away but I think real hard before you pass this that's all, that's all I'm going to say, you're going to do it.

1206
01:37:43,370 --> 01:37:52,818
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, listen, I, I'm more focused on hyper local issues you know I didn't run for Congress I didn't run for state senator for Memphis City Council I want to fix potholes I want to fix streets all right but I also want to protect people.

1207
01:37:53,438 --> 01:37:59,162
[SPEAKER_20]: And when I'm looking at this language and I'm listening to Councilor Singh and Councilor Collins speech.

1208
01:37:59,643 --> 01:38:03,326
[SPEAKER_20]: I think all the saying is that Memphis government should mind its business.

1209
01:38:05,571 --> 01:38:11,340
[SPEAKER_20]: to issues of sexuality, when we're being asked to enforce another state's laws and provisions.

1210
01:38:12,361 --> 01:38:19,291
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the best way to explain this 100 we should just mind our business right right this is about getting government out of people's personal lives.

1211
01:38:20,813 --> 01:38:24,717
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about letting families and doctors make their own decision.

1212
01:38:25,157 --> 01:38:30,962
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is a right-wing talking point to say that people who are 12, 13, 14 are getting sex changes.

1213
01:38:31,002 --> 01:38:36,007
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a right-wing talking point because that's not the case with what's happening in our country right now.

1214
01:38:36,507 --> 01:38:37,508
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not true.

1215
01:38:38,008 --> 01:38:39,069
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not happening.

1216
01:38:39,109 --> 01:38:40,571
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a made-up fiction.

1217
01:38:41,191 --> 01:38:43,252
[SPEAKER_01]: to get people scared about these issues.

1218
01:38:43,392 --> 01:38:45,834
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, let's look at it from just an operational standpoint, right?

1219
01:38:46,134 --> 01:38:49,816
[SPEAKER_20]: Just from, I mean, we just talked about having a $7.5 million budget deficit, right?

1220
01:38:50,096 --> 01:38:50,937
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's keep our streets safe.

1221
01:38:50,977 --> 01:38:51,817
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's worry about that, right?

1222
01:38:51,837 --> 01:38:55,920
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's not get involved in other states, nonsensical policies.

1223
01:38:55,980 --> 01:38:57,400
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have time for it.

1224
01:38:57,420 --> 01:38:58,461
[SPEAKER_20]: Why are we gonna get involved in that?

1225
01:38:58,501 --> 01:38:59,682
[SPEAKER_20]: That's the way I look at it.

1226
01:39:00,242 --> 01:39:01,423
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have time for it.

1227
01:39:01,443 --> 01:39:02,123
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have money for it.

1228
01:39:02,143 --> 01:39:04,985
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is basically just saying, you know, it's not our business.

1229
01:39:05,265 --> 01:39:07,666
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not our place in government.

1230
01:39:07,686 --> 01:39:09,868
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councillor Hussain.

1231
01:39:09,888 --> 01:39:10,468
[SPEAKER_14]: Councillor Collins?

1232
01:39:11,641 --> 01:39:12,402
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, President Murillo.

1233
01:39:12,422 --> 01:39:13,364
[SPEAKER_15]: I was going to make the same point.

1234
01:39:13,384 --> 01:39:14,606
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1235
01:39:15,748 --> 01:39:17,130
[SPEAKER_14]: Melanie Tringale on Zoom.

1236
01:39:17,190 --> 01:39:19,314
[SPEAKER_14]: Name and address for the record, please.

1237
01:39:20,950 --> 01:39:23,211
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, Melanie Tringali, 116 Forest Street.

1238
01:39:24,192 --> 01:39:26,753
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a couple of points of clarification I'm asking.

1239
01:39:27,833 --> 01:39:33,796
[SPEAKER_00]: One, if it's really not your business or our business, then why are we writing an ordinance, number one.

1240
01:39:33,816 --> 01:39:43,200
[SPEAKER_00]: And number two, when you say whether child or adult, are you usurping the parental rights for that decision?

1241
01:39:43,240 --> 01:39:46,642
[SPEAKER_00]: So if a 12 year old child came here from another state

1242
01:39:47,745 --> 01:39:50,829
[SPEAKER_00]: wanting a sexual change but the parent doesn't.

1243
01:39:51,750 --> 01:39:54,232
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your, how is that ordinance going to deal with that.

1244
01:39:55,373 --> 01:40:05,805
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my last point is, you know, some of the things you say is not, I think,

1245
01:40:06,863 --> 01:40:08,565
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of your words were a little bit harsh.

1246
01:40:09,445 --> 01:40:11,687
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a Catholic, I'm against abortion.

1247
01:40:11,707 --> 01:40:25,917
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't force people not having abortion, but I do believe strong morals and values that it's wrong and that people should be counseled on those types of things.

1248
01:40:27,058 --> 01:40:31,401
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think that children make decisions rashly.

1249
01:40:31,942 --> 01:40:34,504
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't think as a parent of four children,

1250
01:40:35,384 --> 01:40:38,865
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you they don't think about the consequences very often.

1251
01:40:41,006 --> 01:40:43,507
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I guess those are my questions.

1252
01:40:43,527 --> 01:40:46,968
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, you talked about medical rights and medical freedom.

1253
01:40:47,288 --> 01:40:58,372
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just wondering where the medical rights and medical freedom were when those that didn't want to have vaccine mandates were excluded from a lot of their activities over the past year and a half.

1254
01:40:58,392 --> 01:40:59,693
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I have to say.

1255
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:01,781
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. Ngole.

1256
01:41:03,342 --> 01:41:04,342
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyone else would like to speak?

1257
01:41:04,402 --> 01:41:05,083
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Behrs.

1258
01:41:05,603 --> 01:41:06,404
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Madam President.

1259
01:41:06,424 --> 01:41:19,413
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I think Councilor Knight reiterated a major point here, which is just saying that we're not going to try to enforce the laws of other states and jurisdictions when it comes to this issue.

1260
01:41:19,873 --> 01:41:20,814
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's all this means.

1261
01:41:21,595 --> 01:41:25,237
[SPEAKER_19]: Secondly, this is going to subcommittee for discussion, so we're not making a final decision tonight.

1262
01:41:25,898 --> 01:41:30,141
[SPEAKER_19]: And third, the facts are very clear that people who, whatever age,

1263
01:41:30,829 --> 01:41:39,918
[SPEAKER_19]: whatever age, this says individuals, any age, that people of any age who, and as Mr. Petronio said, that people need to work this out on their own.

1264
01:41:40,458 --> 01:41:43,261
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, working this out on their own, there's a support system there.

1265
01:41:43,961 --> 01:41:55,032
[SPEAKER_19]: People who receive support, who receive kind guidance and advice are much, much less likely to commit acts of self-harm.

1266
01:41:57,022 --> 01:42:04,788
[SPEAKER_19]: than people who are told, you can't access this, this is a crime, you can't do this, and we'll come after you.

1267
01:42:05,449 --> 01:42:06,510
[SPEAKER_19]: That's the difference here.

1268
01:42:06,550 --> 01:42:11,454
[SPEAKER_19]: People who are penalized and criminalized for their medical decisions, those are the people who commit self-harm.

1269
01:42:11,494 --> 01:42:12,495
[SPEAKER_19]: Those are the people who get hurt.

1270
01:42:13,095 --> 01:42:24,385
[SPEAKER_19]: People who receive support and advice and the kind of network of people behind them to make a very difficult decision, which we all acknowledge and said many times is an incredibly difficult decision.

1271
01:42:26,405 --> 01:42:37,612
[SPEAKER_19]: in some cases, you know, those are the people who go on to not face self-harming, face social isolation.

1272
01:42:39,153 --> 01:42:44,336
[SPEAKER_19]: So, you know, that those, regardless of comments made, those are the facts.

1273
01:42:44,757 --> 01:42:45,117
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1274
01:42:45,437 --> 01:42:46,358
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Vice Chair Behrs.

1275
01:42:46,618 --> 01:42:47,618
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyone else like to speak?

1276
01:42:50,900 --> 01:42:53,062
[SPEAKER_14]: Seeing none, on the motion.

1277
01:42:54,660 --> 01:42:59,621
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Sagan, Councilor Collins, seconded by... I'm sorry.

1278
01:43:00,241 --> 01:43:08,423
[SPEAKER_14]: It is on the motion of Bipartisan Affairs to send this paper to the Public Health and Community Safety Subcommittee, seconded by Councilor Sagan.

1279
01:43:08,904 --> 01:43:09,624
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

1280
01:43:10,484 --> 01:43:11,204
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

1281
01:43:12,544 --> 01:43:13,905
[SPEAKER_14]: That's sorry, and that paper has amended.

1282
01:43:14,265 --> 01:43:14,905
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

1283
01:43:16,025 --> 01:43:17,366
[SPEAKER_14]: Public participation.

1284
01:43:17,406 --> 01:43:19,406
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there anyone who would like to speak for public participation?

1285
01:43:22,567 --> 01:43:22,967
[SPEAKER_14]: Any subject?

1286
01:43:29,491 --> 01:43:30,451
[SPEAKER_14]: Name and address for the record, please.

1287
01:43:30,511 --> 01:43:32,672
[SPEAKER_22]: Richard Orlando, Winford Way, Medford.

1288
01:43:33,533 --> 01:43:40,116
[SPEAKER_22]: Last night I was at the school committee meeting and not to revisit all the budget discussion of the shortfall.

1289
01:43:40,136 --> 01:43:41,696
[SPEAKER_22]: It was much of that last night.

1290
01:43:42,037 --> 01:43:46,078
[SPEAKER_22]: I think there were about 150 people from the teachers association there.

1291
01:43:46,098 --> 01:43:53,642
[SPEAKER_22]: And there's a lot of frustration between the teachers association union and the administration of school committee.

1292
01:43:53,662 --> 01:43:57,324
[SPEAKER_22]: They'll work that out and eventually that'll ripple up to this body.

1293
01:43:58,938 --> 01:44:11,589
[SPEAKER_22]: What I would just ask that this body, the city council consider, as I listened to the meeting last night, and by their own admission, they found out about this shortfall of $8 million.

1294
01:44:12,510 --> 01:44:15,713
[SPEAKER_22]: Unexpectedly, they haven't investigated it sufficiently.

1295
01:44:15,773 --> 01:44:21,218
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't think they've thought about the different methods they might try to resolve it with.

1296
01:44:22,542 --> 01:44:24,365
[SPEAKER_22]: and close that gap.

1297
01:44:24,485 --> 01:44:26,067
[SPEAKER_22]: That's all yet to be discussed.

1298
01:44:26,808 --> 01:44:35,780
[SPEAKER_22]: What bothered me was, and this isn't an exact quote, but one of the school committee members said, Medford people don't want to pay.

1299
01:44:37,598 --> 01:44:43,280
[SPEAKER_22]: I think as a budget around $200 million a year, something in that range right now, we're a little bit shy of that.

1300
01:44:43,320 --> 01:44:45,100
[SPEAKER_22]: I think people in Medford do pay.

1301
01:44:45,741 --> 01:44:50,922
[SPEAKER_22]: So that was the audacity of that statement was very insulting, I think to Medford citizens.

1302
01:44:51,703 --> 01:44:59,425
[SPEAKER_22]: And then quickly, we started hearing discussions from different members of the school committee about prop two and a half overrides.

1303
01:45:00,505 --> 01:45:03,086
[SPEAKER_22]: You've just found out about the gap.

1304
01:45:03,626 --> 01:45:05,247
[SPEAKER_22]: You haven't investigated it yet.

1305
01:45:05,755 --> 01:45:10,538
[SPEAKER_22]: and you have a knee jerk reaction to start proposing a prop two and a half over.

1306
01:45:10,718 --> 01:45:25,867
[SPEAKER_22]: I know such a decision would go through a lengthy process, but I would hope that this committee, this body, I'm sorry, the school city council would show the citizens of Medford a bit more respect than what I heard last night.

1307
01:45:26,307 --> 01:45:27,088
[SPEAKER_22]: So thank you.

1308
01:45:27,548 --> 01:45:28,288
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. Orlando.

1309
01:45:28,308 --> 01:45:30,990
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyone else who would like to speak for public participation?

1310
01:45:35,463 --> 01:45:38,285
[SPEAKER_14]: Not seeing any, this is the end of our agenda.

1311
01:45:40,827 --> 01:45:44,230
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to adjourn, seconded by Councilor Sang.

1312
01:45:44,390 --> 01:45:45,210
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

1313
01:45:45,231 --> 01:45:46,972
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

1314
01:45:47,512 --> 01:45:48,393
[SPEAKER_14]: Meeting is adjourned.
