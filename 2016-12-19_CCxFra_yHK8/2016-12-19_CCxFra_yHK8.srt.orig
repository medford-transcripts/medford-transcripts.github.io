00:00:17,294 --> 00:00:17,978
[SPEAKER_15]: ...by George Richard Mondo which is...

2
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:50,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much, Mr. Cigney.

3
00:03:50,571 --> 00:03:55,253
[SPEAKER_05]: As usual, we are always pleased to have our orchestra come play for us.

4
00:03:55,593 --> 00:03:57,794
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an honor for us to be here to listen to you tonight.

5
00:04:02,255 --> 00:04:02,996
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

6
00:04:03,016 --> 00:04:03,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

7
00:04:04,217 --> 00:04:04,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Van de Kloot.

8
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:19,980
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Zigney, I waited all day today knowing that the students were going to be here, anticipating, knowing what joy you would bring us.

9
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,200
[SPEAKER_16]: And it was joy over the last two weeks.

10
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:34,963
[SPEAKER_16]: I managed to attend every concert this winter season, and it was just thrilling, whether it's a group of 12 or, I don't know, 14 students you have tonight, or 125 or 30, I don't know, there's so many on the stage.

11
00:04:35,304 --> 00:04:37,224
[SPEAKER_16]: It's amazing that you managed to do it.

12
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:40,165
[SPEAKER_16]: And Miss Cheng as well, wonderful concert.

13
00:04:40,225 --> 00:04:41,325
[SPEAKER_16]: The choir concert was great.

14
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:48,046
[SPEAKER_16]: They were absolutely fabulous and we're really proud of our students and thank you very much Mr. Zigny for bringing them to us tonight and always.

15
00:04:54,793 --> 00:04:55,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Benedetto.

16
00:04:55,734 --> 00:04:56,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

17
00:04:56,214 --> 00:05:05,641
[SPEAKER_04]: I also want to thank the parents for coming out to so many events throughout the community, because I've seen them playing up at the high school for open house nights and a lot of different functions.

18
00:05:06,042 --> 00:05:08,123
[SPEAKER_04]: And every time I walk in, it makes my night.

19
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:09,905
[SPEAKER_04]: It just starts it with such joy.

20
00:05:10,405 --> 00:05:15,429
[SPEAKER_04]: And these children have great talent, and I appreciate your dedication as well.

21
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:17,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Merry Christmas.

22
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:59,602
[SPEAKER_04]: So we made a request to add a protocol that Mr. Belson was going to check into and get back to us on Ms.

23
00:05:59,622 --> 00:06:05,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Stone's concern about things that happen outside of school time and teachers hear about it.

24
00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:09,713
[SPEAKER_04]: So could we just add that to the agenda list of things to be done?

25
00:06:10,314 --> 00:06:10,715
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all.

26
00:06:13,018 --> 00:06:14,839
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like a policy.

27
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:16,399
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a policy.

28
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:26,821
[SPEAKER_04]: The superintendent was to draft a policy about outside of school issues in a protocol, so that way everybody at every school follows the same protocol.

29
00:06:26,841 --> 00:06:30,582
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we could add that to the drop-down list, so that way we keep track of that.

30
00:06:30,962 --> 00:06:33,483
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion to add that to our report list, do.

31
00:06:33,883 --> 00:06:34,503
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

32
00:06:34,523 --> 00:06:34,583
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

33
00:06:35,303 --> 00:06:35,923
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

34
00:06:36,024 --> 00:06:36,744
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion carries.

35
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:37,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

36
00:06:37,724 --> 00:06:38,964
[SPEAKER_05]: And is there a second on the minutes?

37
00:06:38,984 --> 00:06:39,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

38
00:06:39,244 --> 00:06:39,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Opposed by Ms.

39
00:06:39,824 --> 00:06:40,385
[SPEAKER_05]: Van de Kloot.

40
00:06:40,985 --> 00:06:42,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call, Mr. Secretary.

41
00:06:49,478 --> 00:07:01,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí,

42
00:07:15,254 --> 00:07:17,455
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just wondering what that service was for.

43
00:07:17,495 --> 00:07:19,815
[SPEAKER_04]: It just seemed like a lot that we don't usually see.

44
00:07:21,296 --> 00:07:24,496
[SPEAKER_04]: So the name of the person is Valerie DeGeorge.

45
00:07:25,116 --> 00:07:30,038
[SPEAKER_04]: One check on page three, probably the sixth one up from the bottom.

46
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:39,560
[SPEAKER_04]: And then on page six of nine,

47
00:07:40,313 --> 00:07:41,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably 10 up from the bottom.

48
00:07:42,155 --> 00:07:44,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Two, four, six, eight, oh, 11.

49
00:07:44,717 --> 00:07:46,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, pretty close.

50
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:50,461
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just didn't know what those services were and if they were ongoing.

51
00:07:51,382 --> 00:07:54,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes I just like to ask questions so I know what's going on.

52
00:07:54,825 --> 00:07:58,248
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, the superintendent might recall as well.

53
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:03,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you like to review them or do you have an answer for tonight?

54
00:08:09,652 --> 00:08:12,273
[SPEAKER_04]: That's okay, I'm putting you on the spot, I know that.

55
00:08:12,573 --> 00:08:16,095
[SPEAKER_04]: I did have one other question on page three, halfway up the sheet.

56
00:08:16,575 --> 00:08:21,056
[SPEAKER_04]: It was other supplies for $250 for Richard Cheney.

57
00:08:21,617 --> 00:08:30,460
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure it was just supplies that he was getting reimbursed for, but when I see that, it's just not a lot of explanation, so I'd like to know what we're writing on those for.

58
00:08:31,575 --> 00:08:33,097
[SPEAKER_04]: and there's no rush getting back to me.

59
00:08:33,117 --> 00:08:36,240
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion that those three items be investigated by Christine.

60
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,361
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

61
00:08:37,381 --> 00:08:37,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

62
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:38,662
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

63
00:08:38,722 --> 00:08:39,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

64
00:08:39,743 --> 00:08:40,203
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

65
00:08:40,283 --> 00:08:44,127
[SPEAKER_05]: And is there a second on approval of bills to refunds by Ms.

66
00:08:44,147 --> 00:08:44,748
[SPEAKER_05]: DiBenedetto?

67
00:08:45,548 --> 00:08:46,249
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

68
00:08:46,569 --> 00:08:46,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

69
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:47,550
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

70
00:08:48,251 --> 00:08:48,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion carries.

71
00:08:48,992 --> 00:08:50,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Approval of payrolls?

72
00:08:51,534 --> 00:08:52,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to none.

73
00:08:53,695 --> 00:08:55,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion for approval, seconded by Ms.

74
00:08:55,396 --> 00:08:55,956
[SPEAKER_05]: Van de Kloot.

75
00:08:55,996 --> 00:08:56,736
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

76
00:08:56,756 --> 00:08:57,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

77
00:08:57,377 --> 00:08:58,137
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

78
00:08:58,217 --> 00:08:58,877
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion carries.

79
00:08:59,818 --> 00:09:00,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Report of Secretary.

80
00:09:00,798 --> 00:09:01,658
[SPEAKER_05]: There's none.

81
00:09:01,698 --> 00:09:02,259
[SPEAKER_08]: Madam Mayor, my colleague, Ms.

82
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:07,661
[SPEAKER_08]: Gretz, has a report on the school crossing guidance that we would like to have read and to the record.

83
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:25,902
[SPEAKER_18]: I got another update this morning regarding the crossing light at Fulton Street and the Felsway, and I have the update, I'm going to read it to you right now.

84
00:09:26,342 --> 00:09:38,827
[SPEAKER_18]: So the Fulton Street crossing time has been changed, it's been changed for about two weeks now, so the walk sign will go for up to 24 seconds, then it will flash walk for 13 seconds,

85
00:09:40,543 --> 00:09:42,445
[SPEAKER_18]: a bydda'n ymlaen y byddwch gyda'n 13 sec.

86
00:09:42,465 --> 00:09:43,686
[SPEAKER_18]: i gysylltu'n ymlaen gyda'r 3 sec.

87
00:09:43,706 --> 00:09:49,032
[SPEAKER_18]: a byddwch ddim yn ymlaen, fel y bydd y llyfrgellau'n sylweddoli i newid, ac yna bydd yr au'n dechrau mynd.

88
00:09:49,092 --> 00:10:03,366
[SPEAKER_18]: Bydd y departament yng Nghymru hefyd yn edrych ar adnoddu ychydig sefydliad ar y drosglwyddiad ar y drosglwyddiad ar y drosglwyddiad ar y drosglwyddiad ar y drosglwyddiad ar y drosglwyddiad ar y drosglwyddiad ar y drosglwyddiad ar y drosglwyddiad ar y drosglwyddiad ar y drosglwyddiad ar

89
00:10:04,747 --> 00:10:12,369
[SPEAKER_18]: and work more smoothly as it would require less pushing of the pedestrian walk buttons to get from one side of the fulcrum to the diagonal side across.

90
00:10:13,009 --> 00:10:20,211
[SPEAKER_18]: However, it's likely that this will need to be reexamined in the spring due to the weather conditions that are coming with the winter coming.

91
00:10:20,671 --> 00:10:23,352
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's difficult to paint lines and do any repaving

92
00:11:05,467 --> 00:11:06,628
[SPEAKER_05]: I can forward you the email.

93
00:11:06,648 --> 00:11:07,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, yeah, no problem.

94
00:11:07,669 --> 00:11:07,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

95
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:08,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.

96
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,792
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion that report be accepted, all those in favor?

97
00:11:10,812 --> 00:11:10,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

98
00:11:11,613 --> 00:11:12,353
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

00:11:13,014 --> 00:11:13,835
[SPEAKER_05]: What is accepted?

[SPEAKER_05]: Report of committees.

00:11:15,136 --> 00:11:17,378
[SPEAKER_05]: None.

102
00:11:17,398 --> 00:11:18,419
[SPEAKER_05]: Community participation.

103
00:11:18,439 --> 00:11:20,121
[SPEAKER_05]: None.

104
00:11:21,542 --> 00:11:22,643
[SPEAKER_05]: Report of superintendent.

105
00:11:23,103 --> 00:11:29,069
[SPEAKER_05]: A recommendation to accept gift from Edward Clark to honor the memory of former director of English, Leah R. Kaleri Clark.

106
00:11:29,349 --> 00:11:30,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Superintendent.

107
00:11:31,068 --> 00:11:45,931
[SPEAKER_12]: Madam Mayor and members of the committee, it's our distinct privilege and honor this evening to have with us Medford resident Professor Emeritus at Suffolk University, Edward Clark, who is the husband of the late director of our English department, Leah R. Kaleri Clark.

108
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:56,593
[SPEAKER_12]: Did an outstanding job during her time as the leader of that department and as an inspiration to our faculty and to our teachers and to our students.

109
00:11:59,233 --> 00:12:16,167
[SPEAKER_12]: Professor Clark is here this evening with his attorney, Paul Kelly, and they are going to make a presentation and ask the committee to accept a gift in honor and memory of Leah in the amount of $25,000 to serve as a scholarship.

110
00:12:16,668 --> 00:12:25,155
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'd like at this time to call upon Attorney Kelly and Professor Clark to join us at the rostrum here to make any statements they would like to make.

111
00:12:28,413 --> 00:12:36,876
[SPEAKER_12]: While they're coming up, I'd indicate that under the direction of our Director of Humanities, Dr. Nicole Chiesa, we have set up some criteria.

112
00:12:36,896 --> 00:12:37,837
[SPEAKER_12]: You have it in front of you.

113
00:12:37,897 --> 00:12:44,540
[SPEAKER_12]: I won't read it at this time, but she is also here, and we welcome any questions that you may have.

114
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,401
[SPEAKER_05]: We welcome you, Mr. Clark and Mr. Kelly.

115
00:12:48,941 --> 00:12:49,862
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you both very much.

116
00:12:50,442 --> 00:12:51,062
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm Paul Kelly.

117
00:12:51,082 --> 00:12:57,045
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a friend of Professor Clark, and I think he'd like to say a few words about his

118
00:12:58,521 --> 00:13:03,082
[SPEAKER_07]: His wife, Leah R. Cleary Clark.

119
00:13:05,602 --> 00:13:14,404
[SPEAKER_01]: Leah was born and raised in Jamaica Point, the oldest of nine children.

120
00:13:16,944 --> 00:13:25,186
[SPEAKER_01]: After high school, she joined the Order of the Sisters of Notre Dame.

121
00:13:26,351 --> 00:13:41,200
[SPEAKER_01]: a teaching order, and over the years she taught every grade from first grade through high school, specializing in English.

122
00:13:44,582 --> 00:13:55,229
[SPEAKER_01]: In the course of those years, she took a bachelor's degree from a manual college and a master's in English from

123
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:59,908
[SPEAKER_01]: the School of English at Middlebury College.

124
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,451
In 1975 she left the Order and

125
00:14:22,198 --> 00:14:26,661
[SPEAKER_01]: became head of the English department in the Medford schools.

126
00:14:32,984 --> 00:14:36,526
[SPEAKER_01]: She retired after 11 years and died of cancer at age 56.

127
00:14:54,103 --> 00:15:06,052
[SPEAKER_01]: One of her favorite enterprises in the Medford schools was what she called Awards Night.

128
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:21,624
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a sort of gala occasion in its way in the auditorium at Medford High School in which she

129
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:38,127
[SPEAKER_01]: gave an award for excellence in English to a considerable number of students at Medford High School.

130
00:15:39,388 --> 00:15:45,330
[SPEAKER_01]: It was held in the auditorium at the high school.

131
00:15:48,352 --> 00:15:50,393
[SPEAKER_01]: She would be very happy to know

132
00:15:51,278 --> 00:16:01,301
[SPEAKER_01]: Žiňo, Žiňo, Žiňo, Žiňo, Žiňo, Žiňo, Žiňo, Žiňo, Žiňo, Žiňo, Žiňo, Žiňo, Žiňo, Žiňo, Žiňo, Žiňo, Žiňo, Žiňo, Žiňo, Žiňo, Žiňo, Žiňo, Žiňo, Žiňo, Žiňo, Žiňo, Žiňo, Žiňo, Žiňo, Žiňo, Žiňo, Žiňo,

133
00:16:18,574 --> 00:16:21,556
[SPEAKER_01]: forward to the school committee.

134
00:16:23,478 --> 00:16:35,928
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for your attention and I thank you for your interest.

135
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:50,781
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Skerry.

136
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:51,862
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mayor.

137
00:16:52,322 --> 00:17:00,769
[SPEAKER_08]: Professor Clark, I would like to thank you on behalf of the citizens and the students of Medford for this great gift, and I would move that we accept it wholeheartedly.

138
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:14,922
[SPEAKER_08]: And on a personal note, I had the privilege and honor of working with Leah in my earlier teaching days at Medford High School, and she taught me a lot that I carried through life and carried on to my second livelihood as a

139
00:17:15,696 --> 00:17:23,159
[SPEAKER_08]: investigator for the Commonwealth and I'm very glad for the lessons that she taught me and I could pass those on to my students.

140
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,781
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, thank you very much for your generosity.

141
00:17:26,321 --> 00:17:36,045
[SPEAKER_16]: Merry Christmas.

142
00:17:36,505 --> 00:17:44,329
[SPEAKER_16]: I too would like to just extend the thanks of myself and the school committee and also for all of those students in the future who are going to

143
00:17:44,822 --> 00:17:51,549
[SPEAKER_16]: receive a generous scholarship because of your generosity tonight.

144
00:17:51,649 --> 00:17:52,590
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you very much.

145
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,411
[SPEAKER_16]: We really appreciate that you've come down.

146
00:17:55,252 --> 00:18:03,940
[SPEAKER_16]: And this was just before my time on the school committee, but I know that Leia's reputation was someone I heard of and was

147
00:18:04,761 --> 00:18:07,482
[SPEAKER_16]: very well known and very well respected.

148
00:18:07,522 --> 00:18:14,846
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you so much and thank you for reminding us tonight during this holiday season of the tremendous people we've had in our past.

149
00:18:15,226 --> 00:18:15,506
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

150
00:18:22,045 --> 00:18:22,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

151
00:18:23,706 --> 00:18:37,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, I want to say thank you for your generosity to Professor Clark, for hers, but more so is the passion that you and she had brought to our district, a passion that I know still exists.

152
00:18:38,189 --> 00:18:42,050
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that passion will be definitely at our award ceremony.

153
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:49,052
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I hope she will be looking down and her spirit will rekindle the generosity that you have brought tonight.

154
00:18:49,132 --> 00:18:49,992
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you very much.

155
00:18:55,073 --> 00:18:55,253
[SPEAKER_18]: Ms.

156
00:18:55,293 --> 00:18:55,573
[SPEAKER_18]: Kress.

157
00:18:56,733 --> 00:18:56,913
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi.

158
00:18:57,153 --> 00:19:00,194
[SPEAKER_18]: I just want to thank you very much for this very generous donation.

159
00:19:00,314 --> 00:19:01,194
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you so much.

160
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:03,415
[SPEAKER_18]: The students will really appreciate it.

161
00:19:03,455 --> 00:19:04,295
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you very much.

162
00:19:04,315 --> 00:19:12,917
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a motion on the floor for approval by Mr. Skerry, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

163
00:19:12,937 --> 00:19:13,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call vote, please.

164
00:19:23,649 --> 00:19:26,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

165
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:31,093
[SPEAKER_05]: We proudly accept this gift, and Awards Night is a night that we all look forward to attending as well.

166
00:19:31,453 --> 00:19:37,295
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a joyous night in our city and for our school department and school children, so we're very proud to be able to add this on.

167
00:19:37,415 --> 00:19:41,797
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you, Professor Clark, from my alumni group.

168
00:19:42,038 --> 00:19:51,062
[SPEAKER_12]: Madam Mayor, I just want to also comment that I had the pleasure of working with Leah for many years,

169
00:19:52,182 --> 00:19:57,347
[SPEAKER_12]: She was a very, very outstanding educator and a good, kind person who really cared about our young people.

170
00:19:57,427 --> 00:20:01,671
[SPEAKER_12]: But I also want to make note that Attorney Kelly this evening is with us.

171
00:20:02,212 --> 00:20:08,198
[SPEAKER_12]: He is the husband of the superintendent of the Arlington Public Schools and the former chairperson of the Winchester Public Schools.

172
00:20:08,618 --> 00:20:13,183
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's a pleasure to have you here and give our best to Kathy because she's a terrific educator too.

173
00:20:13,363 --> 00:20:13,964
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much.

174
00:20:25,092 --> 00:20:25,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

175
00:20:25,493 --> 00:20:31,724
[SPEAKER_05]: A recommendation to accept donation to Columbus Elementary School to honor the memory of Margaret Weigel.

176
00:20:32,685 --> 00:20:33,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Superintendent.

177
00:20:33,186 --> 00:20:37,954
[SPEAKER_12]: Madam Mayor, I call upon our assistant superintendent to join us and explain this gift.

178
00:20:40,988 --> 00:20:42,008
[SPEAKER_20]: Buenas noches.

179
00:20:42,128 --> 00:20:55,351
[SPEAKER_20]: En nombre de Kathy Kaye en la Escuela de Columbia, me gustaría informarles que los colaboradores de Margaret Weigel, que trabajaba en Six Red Marbles, querían hacer una donación a la Escuela de Columbia en su memoria.

180
00:20:55,371 --> 00:20:58,092
[SPEAKER_20]: Recientemente perdió su lucha contra el cáncer.

181
00:20:58,112 --> 00:21:08,955
[SPEAKER_20]: Estaba muy interesada en la educación de los niños y, junto con sus colaboradores, decidieron usar un memorial de $2,000 para una donación a la biblioteca de la Escuela de Columbia.

182
00:21:10,555 --> 00:21:18,440
[SPEAKER_20]: El dinero será donado a la PTO, que trabajará con Amanda Fowler, la paraprofesional de la Escuela de Columbus, para comprar nuevos libros.

183
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,382
[SPEAKER_20]: Se elegirán libros que enriquecerán más la colección, que ahora están creciendo.

184
00:21:22,922 --> 00:21:30,887
[SPEAKER_20]: Cada uno será marcado con un label para leer en amorosa memoria de Margaret Weigel, cuya pasión por el aprendizaje y la comprensión viven.

185
00:21:31,107 --> 00:21:36,450
[SPEAKER_20]: Así que me gustaría que aceptaran esta donación a la Escuela de Columbus por $2,000 en el nombre de Margaret Weigel.

186
00:21:39,497 --> 00:21:40,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

187
00:21:40,618 --> 00:21:40,998
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

188
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:42,880
[SPEAKER_05]: I had the privilege of knowing Margaret.

189
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:47,523
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd call her my friend, as I'm sure several of you as well would call her a friend.

190
00:21:47,543 --> 00:21:48,604
[SPEAKER_05]: She was a friend to many.

191
00:21:49,124 --> 00:21:52,707
[SPEAKER_05]: She took good care of the people in the city, and we miss her dearly.

192
00:21:52,887 --> 00:21:55,769
[SPEAKER_05]: So on behalf, I know there's a motion for approval by Ms.

193
00:21:55,809 --> 00:21:56,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Cuneo.

194
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:58,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a second on the floor by Ms.

195
00:21:58,451 --> 00:21:59,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Van de Kloot?

196
00:21:59,672 --> 00:22:00,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call vote, Ms.

197
00:22:00,473 --> 00:22:00,913
[SPEAKER_05]: Discari.

198
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:08,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

199
00:22:09,871 --> 00:22:10,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

200
00:22:10,631 --> 00:22:12,252
[SPEAKER_05]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

201
00:22:12,272 --> 00:22:13,112
[SPEAKER_05]: The motion passes.

202
00:22:13,372 --> 00:22:15,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very, very much to the family of the Weagles.

203
00:22:26,718 --> 00:22:29,819
[SPEAKER_05]: Report on Columbus School's Celebration of Cultures Night.

204
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:30,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Superintendent.

205
00:22:31,202 --> 00:22:37,864
[SPEAKER_12]: Madam Mayor, a return performance by our assistant superintendent because it's Columbus School Night and we're going to discover a lot of things.

206
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:40,565
[SPEAKER_12]: And so, she'll present this report.

207
00:22:41,165 --> 00:22:42,285
[SPEAKER_20]: So, thank you very much.

208
00:22:42,345 --> 00:22:45,566
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm very proud tonight to have our Columbus School family with us.

209
00:22:45,686 --> 00:22:52,268
[SPEAKER_20]: At this time, I'd like Kathy K., the principal of the Columbus School, to come up with Kara.

210
00:22:52,949 --> 00:22:54,729
[SPEAKER_20]: Kara, I'm trying to remember your last name, Rossi.

211
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:59,991
[SPEAKER_20]: And I want to thank the Columbus School family who are here tonight to celebrate as well.

212
00:23:01,192 --> 00:23:05,593
[SPEAKER_20]: Hay dos reportes que me gustaría contarles esta noche.

213
00:23:05,613 --> 00:23:08,814
[SPEAKER_20]: El primero es la celebración de Culturas de la Columbia.

214
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:13,335
[SPEAKER_20]: Como saben, si van a la Escuela de la Columbia, hay tantas culturas diferentes para celebrar.

215
00:23:13,355 --> 00:23:21,158
[SPEAKER_20]: Entonces, el 17 de noviembre de la tercera semana, hicieron su segundo anual de agradecimiento, una celebración de Culturas de la Columbia.

216
00:23:21,178 --> 00:23:29,000
[SPEAKER_20]: Todas las familias de la Escuela de la Columbia fueron invitadas a compartir y celebrar los diversos backgroundes que hacen la Escuela de la Columbia un lugar tan especial.

217
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:51,248
[SPEAKER_20]: Dinner was provided by local restaurants, and I was there, so I think I sampled every bit from the edible arrangements, Harrow's Chicken Pie, Razzo's Flatbread Company, Istanbulu, Oasis, May's Cafe, Bocelli's, La Casha's, Salvatore's, Boston Shy, Party, and Kelly's Roast Beef.

218
00:23:52,008 --> 00:24:05,379
[SPEAKER_20]: There were cultural performances by the children and families, including piano and gymnastics, martial arts, bilingual storytelling, and a rousing performance of the music of Mali by Balka.

219
00:24:05,399 --> 00:24:07,961
[SPEAKER_20]: You're going to have to help me with this, Kathy.

220
00:24:10,405 --> 00:24:11,345
[SPEAKER_20]: y su familia.

221
00:24:11,365 --> 00:24:20,547
[SPEAKER_20]: Los premios de la batalla incluyeron un curso de ocho semanas de danza caliente, puzzles, libros y samplos de canela de todo el mundo.

222
00:24:20,567 --> 00:24:22,908
[SPEAKER_20]: Fue realmente una noche extraordinaria.

223
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:32,390
[SPEAKER_20]: Los niños estaban todos trabajando en tablas separadas, haciendo artes y crafts, haciendo flags, jugando juegos con los maestros que estaban ahí.

224
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,011
[SPEAKER_20]: ¿Te gustaría aprender nuevas lenguas?

225
00:24:34,031 --> 00:24:35,131
[SPEAKER_20]: Por favor, vengan.

226
00:24:35,151 --> 00:24:39,872
[SPEAKER_17]: Y no hubiera sucedido sin el maravilloso PTO en la Escuela Elementaria de Columbus, muchos de los que están aquí hoy.

227
00:24:40,541 --> 00:24:40,927
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, thank you.

228
00:24:44,882 --> 00:24:57,171
[SPEAKER_17]: They worked tirelessly, you know, up until the time, getting the vendors to support their goods for the evening and getting parents to be involved, canvassing the kids to do their events.

229
00:24:57,832 --> 00:25:05,377
[SPEAKER_17]: One of our students played the piano, and some other kids got up and did their martial arts, and they read bilingual books like Mrs. Caldwell said.

230
00:25:05,417 --> 00:25:07,799
[SPEAKER_17]: And it was just a fantastic night, and everyone really had a good time.

231
00:25:07,819 --> 00:25:10,281
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're looking forward to number three, and please join us next year.

232
00:25:22,218 --> 00:25:31,719
[SPEAKER_05]: So this was really a very fun experience as well.

233
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:38,041
[SPEAKER_20]: And I have to say that Kara Rossi was behind us two years ago.

234
00:25:38,701 --> 00:25:45,582
[SPEAKER_20]: She came to me and she wanted to have this little free library and we were working on a solution to try to figure out how to do it.

235
00:25:46,182 --> 00:26:03,936
[SPEAKER_20]: Then along came Eric Handler, who is the husband of Shannon Handler, who is a special education teacher at the Columbus Elementary School, and of course, Mrs. Rossi, with her fifth grade students as they work together on a project that will actually air on PBS in the near future.

236
00:26:04,536 --> 00:26:07,138
[SPEAKER_20]: The project is called Little Free Library.

237
00:26:07,738 --> 00:26:11,661
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. Handler and his design squad kids, are they here tonight?

238
00:26:12,812 --> 00:26:13,252
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

239
00:26:14,692 --> 00:26:16,053
[SPEAKER_20]: Your kids.

240
00:26:17,533 --> 00:26:21,914
[SPEAKER_20]: So, worked with the Columbus School to install their handiwork.

241
00:26:22,354 --> 00:26:25,655
[SPEAKER_20]: The full video production will be completed in about two months.

242
00:26:26,215 --> 00:26:29,016
[SPEAKER_20]: The students had a great time and worked really well together.

243
00:26:29,456 --> 00:26:33,077
[SPEAKER_20]: And Mr. Handel was very impressed by the hard work of the children.

244
00:26:33,897 --> 00:26:37,418
[SPEAKER_20]: So if anybody wants to know what is this little school library,

245
00:26:38,338 --> 00:26:45,447
[SPEAKER_20]: You can go to the website, or I can tell you that it is take a book, return a book, free book exchange.

246
00:26:46,047 --> 00:26:51,554
[SPEAKER_20]: So they come in many shapes and sizes, but the most common version is the small wooden box books.

247
00:26:52,155 --> 00:26:53,396
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyone can take a book.

248
00:26:53,456 --> 00:26:56,400
[SPEAKER_20]: So in the community, people can stop by and look.

249
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,761
[SPEAKER_20]: And if you turn to the page right,

250
00:26:58,582 --> 00:26:59,683
[SPEAKER_20]: gave you a picture of Ms.

251
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:04,546
[SPEAKER_20]: Rossi and her group of children, you can see there is a picture of the little school library.

252
00:27:05,107 --> 00:27:06,948
[SPEAKER_20]: So at this time I'd like to call upon Ms.

253
00:27:07,028 --> 00:27:09,550
[SPEAKER_20]: Kara Rossi to tell you a little bit about it as well.

254
00:27:11,471 --> 00:27:11,631
[SPEAKER_20]: Ms.

255
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:12,032
[SPEAKER_20]: Rossi.

256
00:27:12,912 --> 00:27:13,653
[SPEAKER_20]: And the children.

257
00:27:22,622 --> 00:27:25,505
[SPEAKER_22]: School Committee, thank you so much for putting us on the agenda tonight.

258
00:27:25,545 --> 00:27:26,747
[SPEAKER_22]: We really appreciate it.

259
00:27:27,087 --> 00:27:28,809
[SPEAKER_22]: Mayor and Mr. Bellson as well.

260
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:31,552
[SPEAKER_22]: So, as Ms.

261
00:27:31,592 --> 00:27:40,282
[SPEAKER_22]: Caldwell said, this has been kind of a two-year project for me, and Eric Handler kind of came along and basically read my mind.

262
00:27:42,865 --> 00:27:45,728
[SPEAKER_22]: He provided the Little Free Library.

263
00:27:45,748 --> 00:27:48,530
[SPEAKER_22]: It looks like a large birdhouse, right?

264
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:50,012
[SPEAKER_22]: A freestanding birdhouse.

265
00:27:51,533 --> 00:27:53,194
[SPEAKER_22]: He supplied it with books to start.

266
00:27:53,675 --> 00:28:01,141
[SPEAKER_22]: I am the library steward for that, so it is registered nationally, so I will be in charge of maintaining it and kind of checking on it.

267
00:28:01,902 --> 00:28:04,905
[SPEAKER_22]: It will have both children's books as well as adult books.

268
00:28:05,765 --> 00:28:09,667
[SPEAKER_22]: There are two levels in the actual structure.

269
00:28:10,987 --> 00:28:18,070
[SPEAKER_22]: But I do have a student here who was there the day, and he was in the filming of it too, actually.

270
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:19,491
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I have two of them.

271
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:22,492
[SPEAKER_22]: It was a great experience for them.

272
00:28:22,853 --> 00:28:28,235
[SPEAKER_22]: We have not seen the final production of it, and I believe it's going to be about seven minutes long.

273
00:28:29,155 --> 00:28:38,184
[SPEAKER_22]: I can't wait because it was kind of filmed backwards, as editors and producers do, so it will be nice when we see it all put together.

274
00:28:38,744 --> 00:28:45,831
[SPEAKER_22]: But I'd like them to come to the microphone and maybe give their experience on the day, which was about four hours long.

275
00:28:46,952 --> 00:28:48,533
[SPEAKER_22]: It was windy and cold, yes.

276
00:28:49,614 --> 00:28:52,177
[SPEAKER_22]: So Lindsay and Rafael, please come on up.

277
00:29:00,715 --> 00:29:09,163
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think the best part about that day was probably spending it with everybody and filming it.

278
00:29:09,783 --> 00:29:20,713
[SPEAKER_10]: I just loved hanging out with everybody and yeah.

279
00:29:21,374 --> 00:29:25,037
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe the best part of it was I never was an

280
00:29:28,405 --> 00:29:36,087
[SPEAKER_11]: I never got film before, so it was kind of new to me, but like fun new, not like scary.

281
00:29:38,928 --> 00:29:44,710
[SPEAKER_11]: So it was kind of interesting to be in a film.

282
00:29:51,567 --> 00:30:00,115
[SPEAKER_22]: One of the funniest things about the end of that day was we picked four fifth-grade students and they said, okay, is this going to be done tomorrow?

283
00:30:00,536 --> 00:30:01,536
[SPEAKER_22]: We can watch it tomorrow?

284
00:30:01,817 --> 00:30:02,938
[SPEAKER_22]: And Mr. Handler laughed.

285
00:30:02,958 --> 00:30:05,080
[SPEAKER_22]: He's like, how about two months from now?

286
00:30:05,861 --> 00:30:06,861
[SPEAKER_22]: So it wasn't instant.

287
00:30:08,543 --> 00:30:09,164
[SPEAKER_22]: So thank you.

288
00:30:10,005 --> 00:30:13,789
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a great option for the community to have right out in front of the Columbus.

289
00:30:13,869 --> 00:30:20,938
[SPEAKER_22]: So I hope it gets great use, and in the springtime I think it will be a very busy spot.

290
00:30:20,998 --> 00:30:21,919
[SPEAKER_22]: If not, it already is.

291
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:22,760
[SPEAKER_22]: So thank you.

292
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:23,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thank you, Ms.

293
00:30:23,901 --> 00:30:24,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Rossi.

294
00:30:29,422 --> 00:30:31,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Lindsay and Raphael, great job, by the way.

295
00:30:31,604 --> 00:30:32,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Great job today.

296
00:30:32,064 --> 00:30:33,505
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, they were terrific.

297
00:30:33,525 --> 00:30:41,051
[SPEAKER_20]: So in this season of giving, this started the whole giving back process, which is something that we love to do in our buildings.

298
00:30:41,611 --> 00:30:43,253
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's not just at the Columbus Schools.

299
00:30:43,473 --> 00:30:44,394
[SPEAKER_20]: All of them are doing this.

300
00:30:44,474 --> 00:30:46,915
[SPEAKER_20]: But this held a special place for me.

301
00:30:46,975 --> 00:30:48,797
[SPEAKER_20]: So thank you so much, Columbus School.

302
00:30:49,617 --> 00:30:50,098
[SPEAKER_20]: Great job.

303
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,113
[SPEAKER_20]: We're just going to talk about another donation for the Home for the Little Wanderers.

304
00:31:04,127 --> 00:31:10,029
[SPEAKER_22]: So, earlier this year, I've been with Medford teaching for the past four years.

305
00:31:10,069 --> 00:31:12,230
[SPEAKER_22]: We've always done some sort of community service.

306
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,550
[SPEAKER_22]: We've done treats for troops the past four years.

307
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:22,633
[SPEAKER_22]: This year we took on a new project and donated no-sew blankets, no-sew fleece blankets to the Home for Little Wanderers.

308
00:31:23,993 --> 00:31:29,435
[SPEAKER_22]: My fifth grade students got together six mornings from 8 to 8.30 and they were like busy bees.

309
00:31:29,875 --> 00:31:34,678
[SPEAKER_22]: They made 25 blankets that we donated to the children there.

310
00:31:35,579 --> 00:31:47,566
[SPEAKER_22]: The home was so impressed that one of the gentlemen came in to thank them personally and played an extra recess kickball game with them as well.

311
00:31:48,967 --> 00:31:56,692
[SPEAKER_22]: But of the 75th graders at the Columbus, about half of them showed up in the morning to help make these blankets.

312
00:31:58,467 --> 00:32:01,230
[SPEAKER_22]: Children just want to give, and they were very much involved.

313
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:05,134
[SPEAKER_22]: Very quickly, I'm just going to have each one of them say what they liked best about it.

314
00:32:05,154 --> 00:32:08,258
[SPEAKER_22]: It's beautiful.

315
00:32:08,418 --> 00:32:09,319
[SPEAKER_22]: That's just an example.

316
00:32:16,618 --> 00:32:23,723
[SPEAKER_21]: What I like best about doing the project was actually making the break dance, because it was really fun.

317
00:32:23,803 --> 00:32:29,207
[SPEAKER_21]: Me and my friends got to do it together, and I really enjoyed it a lot.

318
00:32:36,397 --> 00:32:42,500
[SPEAKER_10]: As Fedor said, actually my favorite part of the no-sew blankets was actually making them too.

319
00:32:43,281 --> 00:32:51,805
[SPEAKER_10]: And I also like knowing that they were going to a community that helps children like us.

320
00:32:57,288 --> 00:33:03,752
[SPEAKER_14]: I like the part where you could like, I like making the blankets, but I like that I could be with my friends and everything like that.

321
00:33:04,392 --> 00:33:05,032
[SPEAKER_14]: Just, it was fun.

322
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:23,250
[SPEAKER_13]: I liked making the blankets and donating them to the kids and I was with my friends so I wasn't as nervous and I also liked that we were with our friends doing it.

323
00:33:28,793 --> 00:33:33,837
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite part was being with my friends in the morning and being

324
00:33:35,363 --> 00:33:38,344
[SPEAKER_00]: and making the blankets because they were soft and fluffy.

325
00:33:44,767 --> 00:33:52,310
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably the best part of making the blankets is that it helps others that need it.

326
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:57,111
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's basically helping others.

327
00:33:57,291 --> 00:33:58,352
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's what it's all about.

328
00:34:03,425 --> 00:34:04,146
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you so much.

329
00:34:04,166 --> 00:34:04,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much, Ms.

330
00:34:05,087 --> 00:34:05,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Rossi.

331
00:34:05,647 --> 00:34:06,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

332
00:34:06,108 --> 00:34:16,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a motion to receive in place Columbus School Little Free Library report on file, please?

333
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,822
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion, Mr. Skerry, seconded by Ms.

334
00:34:19,862 --> 00:34:20,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Van de Kloet.

335
00:34:20,303 --> 00:34:20,983
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

336
00:34:21,003 --> 00:34:21,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

337
00:34:21,604 --> 00:34:22,245
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

338
00:34:22,325 --> 00:34:22,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

339
00:34:23,968 --> 00:34:24,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

340
00:34:24,108 --> 00:34:25,409
[SPEAKER_16]: Vanderkloot, did you wish to speak on that?

341
00:34:25,589 --> 00:34:29,310
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I just want to thank the parents for coming down and bringing the kids tonight.

342
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:32,651
[SPEAKER_16]: My favorite part was hearing the kids tell us about their projects.

343
00:34:33,051 --> 00:34:37,593
[SPEAKER_16]: Obviously, there's a whole lot going on at the Columbus School, and it's really great.

344
00:34:37,913 --> 00:34:39,994
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm very familiar with the Little Free Libraries.

345
00:34:40,094 --> 00:34:48,057
[SPEAKER_16]: I first ran across them in a Chicago neighborhood when I was visiting, and so I'm so proud that we have one now right outside the Columbus School.

346
00:34:48,237 --> 00:34:48,937
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much.

347
00:34:54,435 --> 00:34:56,057
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to say thank you.

348
00:34:56,117 --> 00:34:59,159
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you to the teachers involved, the parents, the students.

349
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:09,327
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we sit here throughout the year and we're talking about budgets and how to get more money, but tonight really does prove not that we're not trying to get any more money.

350
00:35:09,847 --> 00:35:22,191
[SPEAKER_02]: mais cela prouve le fait que nous pouvons être tellement successeux en pensant vraiment à l'extérieur de la boîte, en faisant quelque chose de passionnant, en le faisant pour soi-même et en étant extrêmement successeux.

351
00:35:22,472 --> 00:35:33,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Et ce que les enfants ont fait et la reputation qu'ils ont déjà construite pour eux-mêmes, il n'y a pas assez d'argent pour vous remercier pour cela.

352
00:35:33,135 --> 00:35:34,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Je veux simplement vous remercier.

353
00:35:42,102 --> 00:35:44,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Report on Global Scholars Program at Museum of Science.

354
00:35:45,043 --> 00:35:45,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Superintendent.

355
00:35:45,903 --> 00:35:57,948
[SPEAKER_12]: Madam Mayor, members of the committee, this was an outstanding activity, and I'm going to call upon our Curriculum Director, Dr. Bernadette Riccadeli, to brief you on the exciting day that our young people had at the scientific...

356
00:36:02,794 --> 00:36:09,699
[SPEAKER_19]: So, good evening, Madam Mayor, Superintendent Belson, and members of the Medford School Committee.

357
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:12,241
[SPEAKER_19]: So Dr. Nicole Chiesa is here with me tonight.

358
00:36:12,381 --> 00:36:22,168
[SPEAKER_19]: I wrote the report, but Dr. Chiesa works, as I do, with the teachers on bringing this wonderful program to Medford.

359
00:36:22,649 --> 00:36:23,670
[SPEAKER_19]: So this is a great night.

360
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:27,192
[SPEAKER_19]: We've talked a lot about the community partnerships, the local partnerships.

361
00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:32,796
[SPEAKER_19]: past relationships we're building on with Ms.

362
00:36:32,836 --> 00:36:33,536
[SPEAKER_19]: Galeri Clark.

363
00:36:34,257 --> 00:36:47,786
[SPEAKER_19]: And tonight we're here to talk about a partnership that we have with a national, actually international organization, Global Scholars, which many of you are familiar with because we've presented about this on this program in the past.

364
00:36:48,246 --> 00:36:58,372
[SPEAKER_19]: So specifically I'm here to talk about a field trip that Global Scholars provided to all of our grade seven students last Wednesday to the Museum of Science.

365
00:36:58,432 --> 00:36:59,113
[SPEAKER_19]: It was a wonderful

366
00:36:59,693 --> 00:37:09,843
[SPEAKER_19]: experience for our students and you can see in the report that it was directly tied to the curriculum that the students are studying in the program.

367
00:37:11,882 --> 00:37:17,845
[SPEAKER_19]: Visita centralizó a preparación de estudiantes para la unidad 3 del Curriculum Conecta Digital de las Ciudades Entitulado Cómo Hacemos Las Cosas.

368
00:37:17,866 --> 00:37:19,086
[SPEAKER_19]: El tema fue la innovación.

369
00:37:19,106 --> 00:37:33,454
[SPEAKER_19]: Los estudiantes observaron los exhibitos de Da Vinci, el genio, para aprender sobre invenciones históricas, ingenieros innovadores y desafíos de diseño para descubrir el proceso de diseño de la ingeniería y cómo se utiliza para crear productos innovadores,

370
00:37:41,478 --> 00:37:49,427
[SPEAKER_19]: Charles River Exhibit in the Yawkey Gallery to see how engineering solutions are being used locally to manage and protect the river.

371
00:37:50,308 --> 00:37:55,233
[SPEAKER_19]: The guiding theme of this visit was on how products are created to solve real-world problems.

372
00:37:55,613 --> 00:37:59,578
[SPEAKER_19]: So there's the connection to that grade 7 program.

373
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:12,097
[SPEAKER_19]: When we first started this program, actually two years ago, we're in our third year of the program, we were the only school in Massachusetts to be participating in it.

374
00:38:13,577 --> 00:38:25,301
[SPEAKER_19]: We helped global scholars reach out, and they are now involved with some schools in Boston, the Everett Public Schools, and I believe it's one school in Chelsea.

375
00:38:25,821 --> 00:38:27,642
[SPEAKER_19]: So on this field trip, there were 1,000 students.

376
00:38:30,664 --> 00:38:32,806
[SPEAKER_19]: By the organizers of this program.

377
00:38:34,167 --> 00:38:36,389
[SPEAKER_19]: And I thought it was well organized.

378
00:38:36,849 --> 00:38:38,951
[SPEAKER_19]: Attached to the report you can see the schedule.

379
00:38:39,672 --> 00:38:41,714
[SPEAKER_19]: So they saw four different exhibits.

380
00:38:42,995 --> 00:38:48,520
[SPEAKER_19]: The Global Scholars provided lunch, and then the day ended with a picture.

381
00:38:49,181 --> 00:38:52,324
[SPEAKER_19]: They actually split the group into two, so there were 500 in one picture and 500 in another.

382
00:38:54,726 --> 00:39:01,710
[SPEAKER_19]: Organizing a photograph of 500 students is not an easy task, but they made it look relatively simple.

383
00:39:02,831 --> 00:39:05,833
[SPEAKER_19]: Prior to this field trip, the teachers did a lot of preparation.

384
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:20,002
[SPEAKER_19]: They were provided guidance on what to prepare the students to see, and then there also was a follow-up sheet, a study guide that the teachers have been working with the students on.

385
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:47,272
[SPEAKER_19]: Y en particular, cuatro de nuestros maestros de la secundaria se han tomado un rol principal en traer esto a nuestros estudiantes.

386
00:39:47,292 --> 00:39:54,854
[SPEAKER_19]: Estos estudiantes son Ryan McCarthy, Kathleen O'Donoghue, Brian Villard y Frank Zizzo.

387
00:39:54,894 --> 00:39:56,474
[SPEAKER_19]: Han hecho un maravilloso trabajo.

388
00:39:56,894 --> 00:40:00,675
[SPEAKER_19]: Han trabajado más cercano con el Dr. Chiesa que yo.

389
00:40:00,695 --> 00:40:02,996
[SPEAKER_19]: He tenido más conexión con escolarios mundiales en Nueva York City.

390
00:40:03,156 --> 00:40:03,856
[SPEAKER_19]: Entre Nicole y yo,

391
00:40:07,977 --> 00:40:09,479
[SPEAKER_19]: We think the program's going great.

392
00:40:09,499 --> 00:40:22,570
[SPEAKER_19]: We're very happy to be able to offer it to Medford students, and we're thankful of the generosity of Marjorie Bloomberg-Tiven and her wonderful, incredibly wonderful staff.

393
00:40:23,691 --> 00:40:25,913
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know if you wanted to offer anything else.

394
00:40:29,609 --> 00:40:30,829
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

395
00:40:30,969 --> 00:40:41,872
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to say thank you very much to the Bloomberg Philanthropies, and I might be saying that wrong, but it was a great day, and it was so enjoyable for the students, the administrators, the teachers, everybody there.

396
00:40:41,912 --> 00:40:46,613
[SPEAKER_18]: We were all involved in the exhibits, having fun, and it was so organized.

397
00:40:47,073 --> 00:40:49,474
[SPEAKER_18]: It was hard to believe there was over 1,000 students there.

398
00:40:49,894 --> 00:40:50,954
[SPEAKER_18]: It was so organized.

399
00:40:51,114 --> 00:40:51,934
[SPEAKER_18]: It was a great day.

400
00:40:52,014 --> 00:40:52,394
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

401
00:40:52,454 --> 00:40:53,255
[SPEAKER_18]: It was a pleasure going.

402
00:40:53,275 --> 00:40:54,115
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

403
00:40:54,775 --> 00:40:55,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

404
00:40:56,015 --> 00:40:58,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a motion on the floor for acceptance of the report by Ms.

405
00:40:58,456 --> 00:40:58,836
[SPEAKER_05]: Kretz?

406
00:40:59,577 --> 00:41:01,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Seconded by Mr. Skerry.

407
00:41:01,517 --> 00:41:02,338
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

408
00:41:03,078 --> 00:41:03,698
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

409
00:41:03,718 --> 00:41:04,738
[SPEAKER_05]: The report is accepted.

410
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:05,859
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

411
00:41:07,219 --> 00:41:08,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Negotiations and legal matters?

412
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:08,680
[SPEAKER_05]: None?

413
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:08,900
[SPEAKER_05]: None?

414
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:10,020
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

415
00:41:11,121 --> 00:41:11,721
[SPEAKER_05]: New business.

416
00:41:11,901 --> 00:41:12,401
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a few.

417
00:41:13,041 --> 00:41:13,562
[SPEAKER_05]: New business.

418
00:41:13,582 --> 00:41:14,702
[SPEAKER_05]: School committee resolution.

419
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:19,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Marvin Brown.

420
00:41:20,204 --> 00:41:23,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Brown was the husband of former science teacher Althea Brown.

[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

425
00:41:43,932 --> 00:41:46,935

[SPEAKER_05]: She was a teacher and administrator for the Medford Public Schools for over 40 years.

429
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:09,617

430
00:42:10,077 --> 00:42:12,760
[SPEAKER_05]: He was a Lincoln School of Science teacher who passed away last week.

431
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:16,603
[SPEAKER_05]: Could we all please rise for a moment of silence on the passing of these fine Medford individuals?

432
00:42:31,459 --> 00:42:31,579
[SPEAKER_16]: Ms.

433
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:32,080
[SPEAKER_16]: Van de Kloot.

434
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:36,504
[SPEAKER_16]: I would just like to take a moment to comment on remembering Jean Barry.

435
00:42:37,024 --> 00:42:48,375
[SPEAKER_16]: Jean was such an exceptional individual, a teacher who just loved what she did, an administrator and a community member, and lastly, a fighter who waged such an incredible

436
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:56,376
[SPEAKER_16]: fight, and with such a wonderful, always upbeat, always lovely personality.

437
00:42:56,736 --> 00:43:14,180
[SPEAKER_16]: So I just take a minute to remember Jean Barry, because over the years on the school committee, she was certainly one of the first teachers that I got to know well, and one who I certainly felt had a very large impact on our students, and I remember her both professionally and personally.

438
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:15,720
[SPEAKER_16]: She's a great lady.

439
00:43:16,402 --> 00:43:19,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Through all of her struggles, she's always had a smile on her face every time I saw her.

440
00:43:20,029 --> 00:43:21,051
[SPEAKER_05]: What a wonderful woman.

441
00:43:21,311 --> 00:43:25,439
[SPEAKER_05]: She will be missed by Medford and beyond, and we were blessed to know her.

442
00:43:26,401 --> 00:43:26,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Miss Disceri.

443
00:43:27,818 --> 00:43:31,500
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I'd also like to express my condolences to the Barry family.

444
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:50,813
[SPEAKER_08]: I grew up in the neighborhood that Jean grew up in, and we both attended Boston State, and she was a teacher that always gave 100%, and she was a principal that was loved by all her students all the time, and would go out of her way to make sure that whatever the students needed, they always had, and she'll be sorely missed.

445
00:43:51,552 --> 00:43:52,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Skerry.

446
00:43:52,572 --> 00:43:53,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Superintendent.

447
00:43:53,553 --> 00:44:00,136
[SPEAKER_12]: Madam Mayor, it's interesting and perhaps ironic that tonight Jean became the first principal of the new Columbus School.

448
00:44:00,836 --> 00:44:03,838
[SPEAKER_12]: And tonight we celebrated the achievements of the Columbus School.

449
00:44:07,582 --> 00:44:16,764
[SPEAKER_12]: in our world as Jean opened that school and she was the queen of her castle, as she would announce in the morning, every morning over the loudspeaker.

450
00:44:17,465 --> 00:44:19,385
[SPEAKER_12]: It was exciting.

451
00:44:19,465 --> 00:44:19,705
[SPEAKER_12]: Go ahead.

452
00:44:20,245 --> 00:44:25,786
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd ask my colleagues if we could dedicate this meeting in the memory of Jean Barry, Sutherland.

453
00:44:26,347 --> 00:44:27,907
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion to dedicate this meeting.

454
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:40,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Finalmente, tenemos un último tema en la agenda, una recomendación para aceptar un don de $50,000 para un programa de lenguaje italiano.

455
00:44:40,952 --> 00:44:41,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Madre Presidente.

456
00:44:42,593 --> 00:44:52,335
[SPEAKER_12]: Madame Mayor, miembros del Comité, el programa de CACI, el Centro Ativo Scholastico, que presenta fondos para que continuemos con nuestro programa de lenguaje elementario y también para apoyar

457
00:45:01,215 --> 00:45:08,823
[SPEAKER_12]: per la sviluppazione della cultura italiana nelle nostre scuole, così centrale al fatto che c'è una forte heretica italiana nella nostra comunità.

458
00:45:10,712 --> 00:45:19,758
[SPEAKER_12]: I had the opportunity to attend a meeting yesterday, and several of our elementary teachers were recognized, and Anne Marie was there.

459
00:45:20,879 --> 00:45:31,546
[SPEAKER_12]: And the ever energetic Jaconda Mata, who heads the organization, presented us with a check for $50,000 to help support that program.

460
00:45:31,566 --> 00:45:36,569
[SPEAKER_12]: So I recommend that we accept it and make it work for us as we go forward.

461
00:45:37,345 --> 00:45:37,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Muy bien.

462

463
00:45:38,126 --> 00:45:44,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Quiero decir que tengo el placer de ir a esta reunión del Board una vez al año y estoy emocionada de que cada vez que vuelvo hemos recibido una donación generosa para nuestro sistema.

464
00:45:44,571 --> 00:45:54,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Y lo que es realmente agradable este año es también la relación que hemos formado con el Consuelo General, el Consuelo General italiano, que está muy interesado en la educación y muy interesado en mirar hacia el futuro de, esperamos,

465
00:46:06,128 --> 00:46:19,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Have already partnered with him in different ways, but the goal is really to express and exchange the culture of the students that we have here to hopefully have like exchange programs going on with the students in Italy.

466
00:46:20,014 --> 00:46:25,377
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really nice when you're working with other partnerships that are really pushing

467
00:46:26,097 --> 00:46:28,338
[SPEAKER_02]: y la parte educativa.

468
00:46:28,518 --> 00:46:35,462
