Thank you very much, Mr. Cigney. As usual, we are always pleased to have our orchestra come play for us. It's an honor for us to be here to listen to you tonight.

8
00:04:02,255 --> 00:04:11,384
Thank you very much. Ms. Van de Kloot.

9
00:04:12,818 --> 00:04:41,405
Mr. Zigney, I waited all day today knowing that the students were going to be here, anticipating, knowing what joy you would bring us. And it was joy over the last two weeks. I managed to attend every concert this winter season, and it was just thrilling, whether it's a group of 12 or, I don't know, 14 students you have tonight, or 125 or 30, I don't know, there's so many on the stage. It's amazing that you managed to do it. And Miss Cheng as well, wonderful concert. The choir concert was great.

10
00:04:41,405 --> 00:04:48,307
They were absolutely fabulous and we're really proud of our students and thank you very much Mr. Zigny for bringing them to us tonight and always.

11
00:04:54,753 --> 00:05:18,091
Mr. Benedetto. Thank you. I also want to thank the parents for coming out to so many events throughout the community, because I've seen them playing up at the high school for open house nights and a lot of different functions. And every time I walk in, it makes my night. It just starts it with such joy. And these children have great talent, and I appreciate your dedication as well. Merry Christmas.

So we made a request to add a protocol that Mr. Belson was going to check into and get back to us on Ms. Stone's concern about things that happen outside of school time and teachers hear about it. So could we just add that to the agenda list of things to be done? That's all.

14
00:06:12,378 --> 00:06:42,365
So it's like a policy. It was a policy. The superintendent was to draft a policy about outside of school issues in a protocol, so that way everybody at every school follows the same protocol. So if we could add that to the drop-down list, so that way we keep track of that. On the motion to add that to our report list, do. All those in favor? Aye. All those opposed? Motion carries. Thank you. And is there a second on the minutes? Second. Opposed by Ms. Van de Kloot. Roll call, Mr. Secretary.

00:07:14,714 --> 00:07:39,740
I was just wondering what that service was for. It just seemed like a lot that we don't usually see. So the name of the person is Valerie DeGeorge. One check on page three, probably the sixth one up from the bottom. And then on page six of nine,

17
00:07:40,313 --> 00:08:04,293
Probably 10 up from the bottom. Two, four, six, eight, oh, 11. Yeah, pretty close. So I just didn't know what those services were and if they were ongoing. Sometimes I just like to ask questions so I know what's going on. I don't know, the superintendent might recall as well. Would you like to review them or do you have an answer for tonight?

18
00:08:08,512 --> 00:08:30,820
That's okay, I'm putting you on the spot, I know that. I did have one other question on page three, halfway up the sheet. It was other supplies for $250 for Richard Cheney. I'm sure it was just supplies that he was getting reimbursed for, but when I see that, it's just not a lot of explanation, so I'd like to know what we're writing on those for.

19
00:08:31,495 --> 00:08:52,555
and there's no rush getting back to me. On the motion that those three items be investigated by Christine. All those in favor? Aye. All those opposed? Motion passes. Thank you. And is there a second on approval of bills to refunds by Ms. DiBenedetto? All those in favor? Aye. All those opposed? Motion carries. Approval of payrolls? Motion to none.

20
00:08:53,635 --> 00:09:08,401
Motion for approval, seconded by Ms. Van de Kloot. All those in favor? Aye. All those opposed? Motion carries. Report of Secretary. There's none. Madam Mayor, my colleague, Ms. Gretz, has a report on the school crossing guidance that we would like to have read and to the record.

21
00:09:11,455 --> 00:09:40,328
I got another update this morning regarding the crossing light at Fulton Street and the Felsway, and I have the update, I'm going to read it to you right now. So the Fulton Street crossing time has been changed, it's been changed for about two weeks now, so the walk sign will go for up to 24 seconds, then it will flash walk for 13 seconds,

However, it's likely that this will need to be reexamined in the spring due to the weather conditions that are coming with the winter coming. And it's difficult to paint lines and do any repaving

I can forward you the email. Okay, yeah, no problem. Okay. Very good. On the motion that report be accepted, all those in favor? Aye. All those opposed? What is accepted? Report of committees. None. Community participation. None. Report of superintendent. A recommendation to accept gift from Edward Clark to honor the memory of former director of English, Leah R. Kaleri Clark. Mr. Superintendent.

26
00:11:31,028 --> 00:11:57,893
Madam Mayor and members of the committee, it's our distinct privilege and honor this evening to have with us Medford resident Professor Emeritus at Suffolk University, Edward Clark, who is the husband of the late director of our English department, Leah R. Kaleri Clark. Did an outstanding job during her time as the leader of that department and as an inspiration to our faculty and to our teachers and to our students.

27
00:11:59,193 --> 00:12:25,535
Professor Clark is here this evening with his attorney, Paul Kelly, and they are going to make a presentation and ask the committee to accept a gift in honor and memory of Leah in the amount of $25,000 to serve as a scholarship. So I'd like at this time to call upon Attorney Kelly and Professor Clark to join us at the rostrum here to make any statements they would like to make.

28
00:12:28,353 --> 00:12:57,985
While they're coming up, I'd indicate that under the direction of our Director of Humanities, Dr. Nicole Chiesa, we have set up some criteria. You have it in front of you. I won't read it at this time, but she is also here, and we welcome any questions that you may have. We welcome you, Mr. Clark and Mr. Kelly. Thank you both very much. I'm Paul Kelly. I'm a friend of Professor Clark, and I think he'd like to say a few words about his

29
00:12:58,441 --> 00:13:25,306
His wife, Leah R. Cleary Clark. Leah was born and raised in Jamaica Point, the oldest of nine children. After high school, she joined the Order of the Sisters of Notre Dame.

30
00:13:26,251 --> 00:13:55,529
a teaching order, and over the years she taught every grade from first grade through high school, specializing in English. In the course of those years, she took a bachelor's degree from a manual college and a master's in English from

31
00:13:56,086 --> 00:14:20,521
the School of English at Middlebury College. In 1975 she left the Order and

32
00:14:22,158 --> 00:14:48,533
became head of the English department in the Medford schools. She retired after 11 years and died of cancer at age 56.

33
00:14:53,883 --> 00:15:23,245
One of her favorite enterprises in the Medford schools was what she called Awards Night. It was a sort of gala occasion in its way in the auditorium at Medford High School in which she

34
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:50,633
gave an award for excellence in English to a considerable number of students at Medford High School. It was held in the auditorium at the high school. She would be very happy to know

36
00:16:18,494 --> 00:16:36,128
forward to the school committee. Thank you for your attention and I thank you for your interest.

37
00:16:50,000 --> 00:17:15,262
Mr. Skerry. Thank you, Mayor. Professor Clark, I would like to thank you on behalf of the citizens and the students of Medford for this great gift, and I would move that we accept it wholeheartedly. And on a personal note, I had the privilege and honor of working with Leah in my earlier teaching days at Medford High School, and she taught me a lot that I carried through life and carried on to my second livelihood as a

38
00:17:15,616 --> 00:17:44,489
investigator for the Commonwealth and I'm very glad for the lessons that she taught me and I could pass those on to my students. And again, thank you very much for your generosity. Merry Christmas. I too would like to just extend the thanks of myself and the school committee and also for all of those students in the future who are going to

39
00:17:44,742 --> 00:18:04,621
receive a generous scholarship because of your generosity tonight. So thank you very much. We really appreciate that you've come down. And this was just before my time on the school committee, but I know that Leia's reputation was someone I heard of and was

40
00:18:04,621 --> 00:18:15,826
very well known and very well respected. So thank you so much and thank you for reminding us tonight during this holiday season of the tremendous people we've had in our past. Thank you.

41
00:18:20,585 --> 00:18:50,572
Thank you. Of course, I want to say thank you for your generosity to Professor Clark, for hers, but more so is the passion that you and she had brought to our district, a passion that I know still exists. And I know that passion will be definitely at our award ceremony. And so I hope she will be looking down and her spirit will rekindle the generosity that you have brought tonight. So thank you very much.

42
00:18:50,572 --> 00:19:14,197
Ms. Kress. Hi. I just want to thank you very much for this very generous donation. Thank you so much. The students will really appreciate it. Thank you very much. There is a motion on the floor for approval by Mr. Skerry, seconded by Mr. Benedetto. Roll call vote, please.

43
00:19:23,309 --> 00:19:51,862
Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative. We proudly accept this gift, and Awards Night is a night that we all look forward to attending as well. It's a joyous night in our city and for our school department and school children, so we're very proud to be able to add this on. So thank you, Professor Clark, from my alumni group. Madam Mayor, I just want to also comment that I had the pleasure of working with Leah for many years,

44
00:19:52,182 --> 00:20:14,204
She was a very, very outstanding educator and a good, kind person who really cared about our young people. But I also want to make note that Attorney Kelly this evening is with us. He is the husband of the superintendent of the Arlington Public Schools and the former chairperson of the Winchester Public Schools. So it's a pleasure to have you here and give our best to Kathy because she's a terrific educator too. Thank you very much.

45
00:20:25,072 --> 00:20:38,335
Thank you. A recommendation to accept donation to Columbus Elementary School to honor the memory of Margaret Weigel. Mr. Superintendent. Madam Mayor, I call upon our assistant superintendent to join us and explain this gift.

46
00:20:40,968 --> 00:21:10,415
Buenas noches. En nombre de Kathy Kaye en la Escuela de Columbia, me gustaría informarles que los colaboradores de Margaret Weigel, que trabajaba en Six Red Marbles, querían hacer una donación a la Escuela de Columbia en su memoria. Recientemente perdió su lucha contra el cáncer. Estaba muy interesada en la educación de los niños y, junto con sus colaboradores, decidieron usar un memorial de $2,000 para una donación a la biblioteca de la Escuela de Columbia.

47
00:21:10,415 --> 00:21:39,372
El dinero será donado a la PTO, que trabajará con Amanda Fowler, la paraprofesional de la Escuela de Columbus, para comprar nuevos libros. Se elegirán libros que enriquecerán más la colección, que ahora están creciendo. Cada uno será marcado con un label para leer en amorosa memoria de Margaret Weigel, cuya pasión por el aprendizaje y la comprensión viven. Así que me gustaría que aceptaran esta donación a la Escuela de Columbus por $2,000 en el nombre de Margaret Weigel.

48
00:21:39,457 --> 00:22:01,073
Thank you very much. Thank you. I had the privilege of knowing Margaret. I'd call her my friend, as I'm sure several of you as well would call her a friend. She was a friend to many. She took good care of the people in the city, and we miss her dearly. So on behalf, I know there's a motion for approval by Ms. Cuneo. Is there a second on the floor by Ms. Van de Kloot? Roll call vote, Ms. Discari.

49
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:31,060
Yes. Yes. Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative. The motion passes. Thank you very, very much to the family of the Weagles. Report on Columbus School's Celebration of Cultures Night. Mr. Superintendent.

50
00:22:31,162 --> 00:23:00,811
Madam Mayor, a return performance by our assistant superintendent because it's Columbus School Night and we're going to discover a lot of things. And so, she'll present this report. So, thank you very much. I'm very proud tonight to have our Columbus School family with us. At this time, I'd like Kathy K., the principal of the Columbus School, to come up with Kara. Kara, I'm trying to remember your last name, Rossi. And I want to thank the Columbus School family who are here tonight to celebrate as well.

51
00:23:01,132 --> 00:23:30,140
Hay dos reportes que me gustaría contarles esta noche. El primero es la celebración de Culturas de la Columbia. Como saben, si van a la Escuela de la Columbia, hay tantas culturas diferentes para celebrar. Entonces, el 17 de noviembre de la tercera semana, hicieron su segundo anual de agradecimiento, una celebración de Culturas de la Columbia. Todas las familias de la Escuela de la Columbia fueron invitadas a compartir y celebrar los diversos backgroundes que hacen la Escuela de la Columbia un lugar tan especial.

52
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:51,908
Dinner was provided by local restaurants, and I was there, so I think I sampled every bit from the edible arrangements, Harrow's Chicken Pie, Razzo's Flatbread Company, Istanbulu, Oasis, May's Cafe, Bocelli's, La Casha's, Salvatore's, Boston Shy, Party, and Kelly's Roast Beef.

53
00:23:51,908 --> 00:24:09,222
There were cultural performances by the children and families, including piano and gymnastics, martial arts, bilingual storytelling, and a rousing performance of the music of Mali by Balka. You're going to have to help me with this, Kathy.

54
00:24:09,965 --> 00:24:39,952
y su familia. Los premios de la batalla incluyeron un curso de ocho semanas de danza caliente, puzzles, libros y samplos de canela de todo el mundo. Fue realmente una noche extraordinaria. Los niños estaban todos trabajando en tablas separadas, haciendo artes y crafts, haciendo flags, jugando juegos con los maestros que estaban ahí. ¿Te gustaría aprender nuevas lenguas? Por favor, vengan. Y no hubiera sucedido sin el maravilloso PTO en la Escuela Elementaria de Columbus, muchos de los que están aquí hoy.

55
00:24:39,952 --> 00:24:40,947
Um, thank you.

56
00:24:44,862 --> 00:25:10,681
They worked tirelessly, you know, up until the time, getting the vendors to support their goods for the evening and getting parents to be involved, canvassing the kids to do their events. One of our students played the piano, and some other kids got up and did their martial arts, and they read bilingual books like Mrs. Caldwell said. And it was just a fantastic night, and everyone really had a good time. So we're looking forward to number three, and please join us next year.

57
00:25:18,157 --> 00:25:46,102
So this was really a very fun experience as well. And I have to say that Kara Rossi was behind us two years ago. She came to me and she wanted to have this little free library and we were working on a solution to try to figure out how to do it.

58
00:25:46,102 --> 00:26:12,342
Then along came Eric Handler, who is the husband of Shannon Handler, who is a special education teacher at the Columbus Elementary School, and of course, Mrs. Rossi, with her fifth grade students as they work together on a project that will actually air on PBS in the near future. The project is called Little Free Library. Mr. Handler and his design squad kids, are they here tonight?

59
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:38,178
Okay. Your kids. So, worked with the Columbus School to install their handiwork. The full video production will be completed in about two months. The students had a great time and worked really well together. And Mr. Handel was very impressed by the hard work of the children. So if anybody wants to know what is this little school library,

60
00:26:38,178 --> 00:26:58,462
You can go to the website, or I can tell you that it is take a book, return a book, free book exchange. So they come in many shapes and sizes, but the most common version is the small wooden box books. Anyone can take a book. So in the community, people can stop by and look. And if you turn to the page right,

61
00:26:58,462 --> 00:27:13,953
gave you a picture of Ms. Rossi and her group of children, you can see there is a picture of the little school library. So at this time I'd like to call upon Ms. Kara Rossi to tell you a little bit about it as well. Ms. Rossi. And the children.

62
00:27:22,542 --> 00:27:42,505
School Committee, thank you so much for putting us on the agenda tonight. We really appreciate it. Mayor and Mr. Bellson as well. So, as Ms. Caldwell said, this has been kind of a two-year project for me, and Eric Handler kind of came along and basically read my mind.

63
00:27:42,505 --> 00:28:05,185
He provided the Little Free Library. It looks like a large birdhouse, right? A freestanding birdhouse. He supplied it with books to start. I am the library steward for that, so it is registered nationally, so I will be in charge of maintaining it and kind of checking on it. It will have both children's books as well as adult books.

64
00:28:05,185 --> 00:28:28,675
There are two levels in the actual structure. But I do have a student here who was there the day, and he was in the filming of it too, actually. Yeah, I have two of them. It was a great experience for them. We have not seen the final production of it, and I believe it's going to be about seven minutes long.

65
00:28:28,675 --> 00:28:52,317
I can't wait because it was kind of filmed backwards, as editors and producers do, so it will be nice when we see it all put together. But I'd like them to come to the microphone and maybe give their experience on the day, which was about four hours long. It was windy and cold, yes. So Lindsay and Rafael, please come on up.

66
00:29:00,535 --> 00:29:25,257
So I think the best part about that day was probably spending it with everybody and filming it. I just loved hanging out with everybody and yeah. Maybe the best part of it was I never was an

67
00:29:28,345 --> 00:29:44,950
I never got film before, so it was kind of new to me, but like fun new, not like scary. So it was kind of interesting to be in a film.

68
00:29:51,447 --> 00:30:07,462
One of the funniest things about the end of that day was we picked four fifth-grade students and they said, okay, is this going to be done tomorrow? We can watch it tomorrow? And Mr. Handler laughed. He's like, how about two months from now? So it wasn't instant.

69
00:30:07,462 --> 00:30:24,742
So thank you. It's a great option for the community to have right out in front of the Columbus. So I hope it gets great use, and in the springtime I think it will be a very busy spot. If not, it already is. So thank you. Well, thank you, Ms. Rossi.

70
00:30:29,062 --> 00:30:50,358
Lindsay and Raphael, great job, by the way. Great job today. Yeah, they were terrific. So in this season of giving, this started the whole giving back process, which is something that we love to do in our buildings. And it's not just at the Columbus Schools. All of them are doing this. But this held a special place for me. So thank you so much, Columbus School. Great job.

71
00:30:58,053 --> 00:31:03,655
We're just going to talk about another donation for the Home for the Little Wanderers.

72
00:31:04,027 --> 00:31:29,795
So, earlier this year, I've been with Medford teaching for the past four years. We've always done some sort of community service. We've done treats for troops the past four years. This year we took on a new project and donated no-sew blankets, no-sew fleece blankets to the Home for Little Wanderers. My fifth grade students got together six mornings from 8 to 8.30 and they were like busy bees.

73
00:31:29,795 --> 00:31:56,812
They made 25 blankets that we donated to the children there. The home was so impressed that one of the gentlemen came in to thank them personally and played an extra recess kickball game with them as well. But of the 75th graders at the Columbus, about half of them showed up in the morning to help make these blankets.

74
00:31:57,065 --> 00:32:10,160
Children just want to give, and they were very much involved. Very quickly, I'm just going to have each one of them say what they liked best about it. It's beautiful. That's just an example.

75
00:32:16,538 --> 00:32:30,528
What I like best about doing the project was actually making the break dance, because it was really fun. Me and my friends got to do it together, and I really enjoyed it a lot.

76
00:32:36,097 --> 00:33:06,033
As Fedor said, actually my favorite part of the no-sew blankets was actually making them too. And I also like knowing that they were going to a community that helps children like us. I like the part where you could like, I like making the blankets, but I like that I could be with my friends and everything like that. Just, it was fun.

77
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:34,417
I liked making the blankets and donating them to the kids and I was with my friends so I wasn't as nervous and I also liked that we were with our friends doing it. My favorite part was being with my friends in the morning and being

78
00:33:35,243 --> 00:33:58,632
and making the blankets because they were soft and fluffy. Probably the best part of making the blankets is that it helps others that need it. So it's basically helping others. And that's what it's all about.

79
00:34:03,425 --> 00:34:23,506
Thank you so much. Thank you very much, Ms. Rossi. Thank you. Is there a motion to receive in place Columbus School Little Free Library report on file, please? On the motion, Mr. Skerry, seconded by Ms. Van de Kloet. All those in favor? Aye. All those opposed? Motion passes.

80
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:49,257
Ms. Vanderkloot, did you wish to speak on that? No, I just want to thank the parents for coming down and bringing the kids tonight. My favorite part was hearing the kids tell us about their projects. Obviously, there's a whole lot going on at the Columbus School, and it's really great. I'm very familiar with the Little Free Libraries. I first ran across them in a Chicago neighborhood when I was visiting, and so I'm so proud that we have one now right outside the Columbus School. Thank you very much.

81
00:34:53,915 --> 00:35:09,507
I just want to say thank you. Thank you to the teachers involved, the parents, the students. I know we sit here throughout the year and we're talking about budgets and how to get more money, but tonight really does prove not that we're not trying to get any more money.

82
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:35,056
mais cela prouve le fait que nous pouvons être tellement successeux en pensant vraiment à l'extérieur de la boîte, en faisant quelque chose de passionnant, en le faisant pour soi-même et en étant extrêmement successeux. Et ce que les enfants ont fait et la reputation qu'ils ont déjà construite pour eux-mêmes, il n'y a pas assez d'argent pour vous remercier pour cela. Je veux simplement vous remercier.

83
00:35:42,042 --> 00:35:58,208
Report on Global Scholars Program at Museum of Science. Mr. Superintendent. Madam Mayor, members of the committee, this was an outstanding activity, and I'm going to call upon our Curriculum Director, Dr. Bernadette Riccadeli, to brief you on the exciting day that our young people had at the scientific...

84
00:36:02,714 --> 00:36:29,714
So, good evening, Madam Mayor, Superintendent Belson, and members of the Medford School Committee. So Dr. Nicole Chiesa is here with me tonight. I wrote the report, but Dr. Chiesa works, as I do, with the teachers on bringing this wonderful program to Medford. So this is a great night. We've talked a lot about the community partnerships, the local partnerships.

85
00:36:29,714 --> 00:36:59,313
past relationships we're building on with Ms. Galeri Clark. And tonight we're here to talk about a partnership that we have with a national, actually international organization, Global Scholars, which many of you are familiar with because we've presented about this on this program in the past. So specifically I'm here to talk about a field trip that Global Scholars provided to all of our grade seven students last Wednesday to the Museum of Science. It was a wonderful

86
00:36:59,313 --> 00:37:10,484
experience for our students and you can see in the report that it was directly tied to the curriculum that the students are studying in the program.

87
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:41,078
Visita centralizó a preparación de estudiantes para la unidad 3 del Curriculum Conecta Digital de las Ciudades Entitulado Cómo Hacemos Las Cosas. El tema fue la innovación. Los estudiantes observaron los exhibitos de Da Vinci, el genio, para aprender sobre invenciones históricas, ingenieros innovadores y desafíos de diseño para descubrir el proceso de diseño de la ingeniería y cómo se utiliza para crear productos innovadores,

88
00:37:41,078 --> 00:37:59,978
Charles River Exhibit in the Yawkey Gallery to see how engineering solutions are being used locally to manage and protect the river. The guiding theme of this visit was on how products are created to solve real-world problems. So there's the connection to that grade 7 program.

89
00:38:01,193 --> 00:38:28,902
When we first started this program, actually two years ago, we're in our third year of the program, we were the only school in Massachusetts to be participating in it. We helped global scholars reach out, and they are now involved with some schools in Boston, the Everett Public Schools, and I believe it's one school in Chelsea. So on this field trip, there were 1,000 students.

90
00:38:28,902 --> 00:38:53,725
By the organizers of this program. And I thought it was well organized. Attached to the report you can see the schedule. So they saw four different exhibits. The Global Scholars provided lunch, and then the day ended with a picture. They actually split the group into two, so there were 500 in one picture and 500 in another.

91
00:38:53,725 --> 00:39:20,843
Organizing a photograph of 500 students is not an easy task, but they made it look relatively simple. Prior to this field trip, the teachers did a lot of preparation. They were provided guidance on what to prepare the students to see, and then there also was a follow-up sheet, a study guide that the teachers have been working with the students on.

92
00:39:21,299 --> 00:39:38,410
န်််််််််််််််််််််််််််််််််််််််််််််််််််််််််််််််််််

93
00:39:38,410 --> 00:40:07,537
Y en particular, cuatro de nuestros maestros de la secundaria se han tomado un rol principal en traer esto a nuestros estudiantes. Estos estudiantes son Ryan McCarthy, Kathleen O'Donoghue, Brian Villard y Frank Zizzo. Han hecho un maravilloso trabajo. Han trabajado más cercano con el Dr. Chiesa que yo. He tenido más conexión con escolarios mundiales en Nueva York City. Entre Nicole y yo,

94
00:40:07,537 --> 00:40:26,133
We think the program's going great. We're very happy to be able to offer it to Medford students, and we're thankful of the generosity of Marjorie Bloomberg-Tiven and her wonderful, incredibly wonderful staff. I don't know if you wanted to offer anything else.

95
00:40:29,069 --> 00:40:54,635
Thank you. I want to say thank you very much to the Bloomberg Philanthropies, and I might be saying that wrong, but it was a great day, and it was so enjoyable for the students, the administrators, the teachers, everybody there. We were all involved in the exhibits, having fun, and it was so organized. It was hard to believe there was over 1,000 students there. It was so organized. It was a great day. Thank you. It was a pleasure going. Thank you.

96
00:40:54,635 --> 00:41:23,525
Thank you very much. Is there a motion on the floor for acceptance of the report by Ms. Kretz? Seconded by Mr. Skerry. All those in favor? All those opposed? The report is accepted. Thank you very much. Negotiations and legal matters? None? None? Okay. New business. We have a few. New business. School committee resolution. Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Marvin Brown. Mr. Brown was the husband of former science teacher Althea Brown.

97
00:41:26,832 --> 00:41:47,656
Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Cleveland Red Honeycutt. Mr. Honeycutt was the father of Bill Honeycutt, a generous supporter of the Medford Public Schools. And further, be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Mary Alice Leach. Ms. Leach was the sister of retired Medford Police Officer William Fargo.

98
00:41:48,500 --> 00:42:16,883
Also be it resolved that the Medford School Committee expresses sincere condolences to the family of Jean Barry Sutherland. Jean was a long-time Medford resident. She was a teacher and administrator for the Medford Public Schools for over 40 years. And lastly, that the Medford School Committee expresses sincere condolences to the family of Joseph C. Bettinelli. He was a Lincoln School of Science teacher who passed away last week. Could we all please rise for a moment of silence on the passing of these fine Medford individuals?

99
00:42:31,379 --> 00:42:48,575
Ms. Van de Kloot. I would just like to take a moment to comment on remembering Jean Barry. Jean was such an exceptional individual, a teacher who just loved what she did, an administrator and a community member, and lastly, a fighter who waged such an incredible

100
00:42:48,575 --> 00:43:15,980
fight, and with such a wonderful, always upbeat, always lovely personality. So I just take a minute to remember Jean Barry, because over the years on the school committee, she was certainly one of the first teachers that I got to know well, and one who I certainly felt had a very large impact on our students, and I remember her both professionally and personally. She's a great lady.

101
00:43:16,402 --> 00:43:27,202
Through all of her struggles, she's always had a smile on her face every time I saw her. What a wonderful woman. She will be missed by Medford and beyond, and we were blessed to know her. Miss Disceri.

102
00:43:27,758 --> 00:43:51,113
Yes, I'd also like to express my condolences to the Barry family. I grew up in the neighborhood that Jean grew up in, and we both attended Boston State, and she was a teacher that always gave 100%, and she was a principal that was loved by all her students all the time, and would go out of her way to make sure that whatever the students needed, they always had, and she'll be sorely missed.

103
00:43:51,552 --> 00:44:04,698
Thank you, Mr. Skerry. Mr. Superintendent. Madam Mayor, it's interesting and perhaps ironic that tonight Jean became the first principal of the new Columbus School. And tonight we celebrated the achievements of the Columbus School.

104
00:44:06,622 --> 00:44:28,087
in our world as Jean opened that school and she was the queen of her castle, as she would announce in the morning, every morning over the loudspeaker. It was exciting. Go ahead. I'd ask my colleagues if we could dedicate this meeting in the memory of Jean Barry, Sutherland. On the motion to dedicate this meeting.

105
00:44:32,170 --> 00:45:00,757
Finalmente, tenemos un último tema en la agenda, una recomendación para aceptar un don de $50,000 para un programa de lenguaje italiano. Madre Presidente. Madame Mayor, miembros del Comité, el programa de CACI, el Centro Ativo Scholastico, que presenta fondos para que continuemos con nuestro programa de lenguaje elementario y también para apoyar

106
00:45:01,195 --> 00:45:10,004
per la sviluppazione della cultura italiana nelle nostre scuole, così centrale al fatto che c'è una forte heretica italiana nella nostra comunità.

107
00:45:10,072 --> 00:45:36,869
I had the opportunity to attend a meeting yesterday, and several of our elementary teachers were recognized, and Anne Marie was there. And the ever energetic Jaconda Mata, who heads the organization, presented us with a check for $50,000 to help support that program. So I recommend that we accept it and make it work for us as we go forward.

108
00:45:37,325 --> 00:46:05,708
Muy bien. Señora Cugno. Quiero decir que tengo el placer de ir a esta reunión del Board una vez al año y estoy emocionada de que cada vez que vuelvo hemos recibido una donación generosa para nuestro sistema. Y lo que es realmente agradable este año es también la relación que hemos formado con el Consuelo General, el Consuelo General italiano, que está muy interesado en la educación y muy interesado en mirar hacia el futuro de, esperamos,

109
00:46:05,708 --> 00:46:25,857
Have already partnered with him in different ways, but the goal is really to express and exchange the culture of the students that we have here to hopefully have like exchange programs going on with the students in Italy. So it's really nice when you're working with other partnerships that are really pushing

110
00:46:25,857 --> 00:46:54,832
y la parte educativa. Quiero agradecerle al Consuelo General y, por supuesto, a CACET, dirigido por Johanda Malta. Gracias. Muy bien. En la moción de aprobación por la Sra. Cuno, seguido por la Sra. Kretz, voto en rola Mr. Skerry. Sra. Cuno? Sí. Sra. Delgado? Sí. Sra. Kretz? Sí. Sra. Stone? Sí. Sra. Skerry? Sí. Sra. Cooper? Sí. Sra. Mayweather? Sí. Seven en el afirmativo, cero en el negativo. La moción pasa.

111
00:46:55,304 --> 00:47:13,462
And is there a motion to adjourn? Motion to adjourn. We wish everyone a wonderful holiday season. Stay safe out there. We have some bad weather coming, some ice cold weather coming, so stay warm, stay bundled. Hopefully it'll be during vacation. Motion to adjourn.
