1
00:00:00,131 --> 00:00:01,211
meeting is officially open.

2
00:00:01,231 --> 00:00:03,072
First is review of the minutes from January 2024.

3
00:00:03,252 --> 00:00:07,053
Janelle, do you have those in your inbox?

4
00:00:12,054 --> 00:00:13,074
Yeah, I got the agenda.

5
00:00:16,035 --> 00:00:17,695
I don't think there's any issues.

6
00:00:18,295 --> 00:00:19,476
Motion to approve the minutes.

7
00:00:19,496 --> 00:00:20,696
Second.

8
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:22,756
Minutes approved.

9
00:00:23,317 --> 00:00:23,777
Second.

10
00:00:23,797 --> 00:00:25,797
Jenny, can you take a roll please?

11
00:00:26,037 --> 00:00:26,677
Okay, yep.

12
00:00:27,798 --> 00:00:28,638
Katherine Chabonet?

13
00:00:29,018 --> 00:00:29,218
Yes.

14
00:00:30,354 --> 00:00:32,696
I just wanted you all to to meet.

15
00:00:55,812 --> 00:00:58,834
And he's been a very busy man since the day he arrived.

16
00:00:59,554 --> 00:01:07,577
So, Jason, I don't know if you want to introduce yourself, give us a little background and tell us some of the great work you've been doing, including the coordination of the point in time.

17
00:01:07,597 --> 00:01:08,918
Sure.

18
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:11,999
Yeah, so my name is Jason Stone.

19
00:01:12,019 --> 00:01:12,960
I am not the lawyer.

20
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,741
I do get that pretty much every day.

21
00:01:15,761 --> 00:01:16,581
He is not me.

22
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:20,260
Yeah, I started here in November.

23
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:29,104
I had been working as the social services coordinator and or manager in Wakefield for 2 and a half years roughly before starting here.

24
00:01:30,045 --> 00:01:32,586
Most of my professional experience has been in.

25
00:01:34,407 --> 00:01:49,094
In around the substance use treatment world, I worked in a residential program for years, and I worked for ad care hospital of Worcester for 16 years before joining the city, the town of Wakefield 3 years ago now.

26
00:01:50,294 --> 00:01:51,254
So, it's been a lot of.

27
00:01:53,295 --> 00:02:04,019
What I had focused on in Wakefield, we did a lot of heating assistance, a lot of SNAP benefits, so I had some knowledge of that before coming here.

28
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:18,224
And then even though the role is the same, at least in job title, in Medford as it was in Wakefield, and even though the towns are only six and a half miles apart, very different role so far.

29
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:31,353
a lot of homeless outreach coordination, a lot of requests for services from folks who are in desperate need here in Medford.

30
00:02:32,393 --> 00:02:35,854
One of those things, as Marianne said, was helping to coordinate the pit count.

31
00:02:36,014 --> 00:02:40,495
So I had been only peripherally familiar with

32
00:02:41,135 --> 00:02:49,180
Pit counts over the years, I worked at a program in Lawrence for a number of years, and a couple of my staff were volunteers for their pit count.

33
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,422
Other than that, I knew very little about them until.

34
00:02:52,902 --> 00:03:04,189
About a month and a half ago at this point, for those that aren't familiar, the pit or point in time count is a, it's an annual thing as dictated by HUD.

35
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:20,038
and in Massachusetts by EOHLC, in which we try to get a real-time one-night-a-year count on the number of people who are actively unhoused in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and really in the country.

36
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:26,282
Theoretically, everybody across the Commonwealth and across the country is supposed to do it on the same night.

37
00:03:26,722 --> 00:03:28,323
That way, you're getting an accurate count.

38
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:35,208
And we were focused on Medford, obviously, but we collaborated with ABCD out of Malden.

39
00:03:35,988 --> 00:03:44,672
As our homeless outreach coordinator partners, and because they do mold and Medford Everett, we helped coordinate.

40
00:03:45,472 --> 00:03:55,017
Essentially, for mold and Medford and Everett, we were able to thanks to Marianne and connections there use a facility at tops.

41
00:03:55,737 --> 00:04:03,319
To have sort of a global hub to start the evening at, so that everybody could get trained in knowing what to do, knowing where their areas were.

42
00:04:03,839 --> 00:04:05,479
And then we dispatched teams.

43
00:04:05,539 --> 00:04:09,400
We had close to 60 volunteers signed up.

44
00:04:09,781 --> 00:04:11,701
We had less than that actually show up.

45
00:04:12,501 --> 00:04:14,962
So we had to alter the night of a little bit.

46
00:04:16,102 --> 00:04:19,187
But the pig count took place the last Wednesday in January.

47
00:04:19,928 --> 00:04:26,779
We started training at 6. we went out to count around 7, and I was in the last group to come back around 1030.

48
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:31,066
We ended up coming back to City Hall here in Medford.

49
00:04:31,466 --> 00:04:33,548
Um, and it went all right.

50
00:04:33,908 --> 00:04:35,369
Um, it was my first pit count.

51
00:04:35,429 --> 00:04:37,130
It was a lot of people's first pit counts.

52
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:42,894
It was, uh, the person who was coordinating for us from ABCD.

53
00:04:43,315 --> 00:04:48,238
He had not done one here, but he had done a couple in Los Angeles, uh, in years prior.

54
00:04:48,318 --> 00:04:51,060
So he was at least familiar with how they should operate.

55
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:56,584
Um, definitely learned a lot for next year, but all for all intents and purposes, it went pretty well.

56
00:04:56,604 --> 00:04:56,644
Um.

57
00:04:59,183 --> 00:05:07,511
Yeah, and so as Marion said, I kind of otherwise stay pretty busy here depends on who calls or who walks in the door.

58
00:05:08,091 --> 00:05:15,318
I do have office hours at the library now every Wednesday morning from 10 to noon that's been going on for about.

59
00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:17,320
A little over a month at this point.

60
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,841
It's been pretty good.

61
00:05:19,181 --> 00:05:25,625
I do get people the first couple of weeks where we're still sort of advertising it and letting people know that I was there.

62
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:33,669
But the last three or four weeks, I've had people show up and sometimes occupy me for the entire two hours that I'm there.

63
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:44,275
Once they ask questions about the things that I can maybe help them with, or at least point them in the right direction of, I try to tell people that I am not a service provider.

64
00:05:44,295 --> 00:05:45,756
I'm a service connector.

65
00:05:47,137 --> 00:05:51,539
I'm not your personal therapist or psychiatrist or social worker.

66
00:05:51,699 --> 00:06:02,885
I will help point you in the right direction of where to get those things, help you fill out applications, help you do, like, whether it's MassHealth or had a lot of requests for

67
00:06:03,605 --> 00:06:06,368
assistance with immigration resources.

68
00:06:06,388 --> 00:06:09,852
So that's been an interesting thing to sort of learn on the fly.

69
00:06:11,373 --> 00:06:12,734
But yeah, I think so far so good.

70
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:16,999
It's been a really quick, I think it's been three months now, just over three months.

71
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:18,720
I'm halfway done probation.

72
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,983
So, so far so good.

73
00:06:21,063 --> 00:06:22,284
It's been really, really quick.

74
00:06:23,705 --> 00:06:26,889
But I think so far so good anyway, but that's not really up to me to judge.

75
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,310
has been doing great.

76
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:36,352
He's also doing fuel assistance applications at the library as well for those people in need.

77
00:06:37,152 --> 00:06:41,513
And he works very closely with our recovery coach, our contracted recovery coach, Chris Zuma.

78
00:06:42,293 --> 00:06:46,934
And they run a Wednesday evening recovery support group as well.

79
00:06:47,094 --> 00:06:49,915
So that's been ever expanding.

80
00:06:49,955 --> 00:06:51,675
So that's been really nice to see as well.

81
00:06:52,155 --> 00:06:59,597
That has been nice, yeah, and we've been able to actually now get back into helping folks with sober house scholarships.

82
00:06:59,717 --> 00:07:12,841
There's a few of those out there now for Medford folks who were looking to get into sober housing or to, and that's our recovery coach calling me right now, getting into sober housing or to stay in sober housing in the Medford area, so.

83
00:07:15,162 --> 00:07:16,302
Any questions for Jason?

84
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:17,963
Yeah, so what's the pick count?

85
00:07:18,143 --> 00:07:18,723
What's the number?

86
00:07:20,623 --> 00:07:29,349
The number, I don't have the official number because Ethan was waiting on reporting to come back from a couple of places.

87
00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:35,293
So the way that my understanding is, it's probably about 14.

88
00:07:37,794 --> 00:07:40,976
I'm not 100% sure on that, but it's probably about 14.

89
00:07:41,397 --> 00:07:45,319
And how do you actually find them?

90
00:07:45,359 --> 00:07:47,741
And how accurate is that number?

91
00:07:49,055 --> 00:07:50,156
I mean, how do you know how many?

92
00:07:50,176 --> 00:07:53,198
How would you define that number?

93
00:07:53,298 --> 00:08:01,743
I think it's pretty accurate based on just my experience so far in the calls that I've had and the inquiries I've had.

94
00:08:01,763 --> 00:08:08,627
I did spend a little time going out with Officer Lawless from Medford Police the week prior to the pit count.

95
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:13,050
So he could give me sort of an overview of the normal spots that people

96
00:08:15,004 --> 00:08:16,765
are known to be unhoused in.

97
00:08:16,805 --> 00:08:21,847
There are certainly some locations in Medford that are more popular for that historically than others.

98
00:08:22,687 --> 00:08:34,413
Medford police and Everett police, not Malden, did give us heat maps of all of their calls for service for unhoused people in a certain area in a calendar year.

99
00:08:35,153 --> 00:08:37,456
We did get a heat map of all the calls for service.

100
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:52,331
That's where we find out about a lot of folks is from neighbors, either calling the mayor's office or calling DCR in some cases, because we have DCR land obviously here in Medford and then them coordinating with us.

101
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:52,712
So.

102
00:08:53,913 --> 00:08:59,077
My sense is that the number is fairly accurate, particularly for such a cold night.

103
00:08:59,457 --> 00:09:01,919
A lot of folks go to the Malden warming center.

104
00:09:02,299 --> 00:09:07,163
They are not necessarily counted on the pit count because they're at the warming center.

105
00:09:07,203 --> 00:09:11,787
So the warming center does their own version of reporting for the pit count.

106
00:09:12,987 --> 00:09:22,994
But we broke up the city itself into eight zones and then attached teams of two or three to go out to those eight zones, plus the DCR areas.

107
00:09:23,334 --> 00:09:32,580
DCR didn't do a count for us, which I would have preferred, but it didn't, because we were doing overnight, it didn't match up with their rangers hours.

108
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:39,124
That being said, they did clue us into the spots that they know about where there were unhoused people.

109
00:09:41,377 --> 00:09:59,809
I won't get into the specifics as to why, but they're trying to get a little more into looping in the actual communities that they know of unhoused people living on their property, because they don't want people unhoused on their property, but they also don't want to just go in and evict them, for lack of a better word.

110
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:09,476
So they've been trying to reach out to us, ABCD, Elliott, et cetera, when they have people in those areas to say, look,

111
00:10:09,656 --> 00:10:15,080
We're going to give these folks a three week notice because we don't want them in Middlesex Fells, for example.

112
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:23,425
But we want you to help do some outreach and try to connect them to services so we're not just going in and wiping out their campsite.

113
00:10:24,266 --> 00:10:25,827
So we've done a lot of that recently.

114
00:10:26,327 --> 00:10:33,872
So I did the DCR areas because those were all spots that I knew and I didn't want to have random volunteers walking up into the fells at night.

115
00:10:35,213 --> 00:10:36,394
So those were spots that I knew.

116
00:10:39,577 --> 00:10:43,100
So my sense is that the account was pretty accurate.

117
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:43,701
Yeah, sorry.

118
00:10:43,901 --> 00:10:50,526
I would also say, because I was there when the volunteers came back, the other big issue we have is people living in cars.

119
00:10:51,107 --> 00:10:53,549
Yeah, it's a lot harder to capture.

120
00:10:54,689 --> 00:11:00,294
So we did have some observations of folks that we suspected to be living in their cars.

121
00:11:00,354 --> 00:11:01,795
But we think that that's it.

122
00:11:02,096 --> 00:11:03,156
You're a little quiet.

123
00:11:03,176 --> 00:11:04,898
Can you turn up your volume?

124
00:11:05,558 --> 00:11:06,439
Thank you.

125
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:07,880
Sorry.

126
00:11:16,778 --> 00:11:26,127
Yeah, that was a pretty, that is something that I wanted, that I tried to tell people, at least if I knew their areas, where they were going.

127
00:11:26,787 --> 00:11:39,038
To be mindful of folks that were in cars on those particular, like the cold, cold nights, we don't have an awful lot of people who are what you sort of envision as traditionally unhoused or living in encampments because it's cold out.

128
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,820
But we do have,

129
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:49,255
Most of those folks, most of those 14 that I know are folks who are living in cars or vans, et cetera, et cetera.

130
00:11:50,896 --> 00:11:55,640
But they tend to have a spot that they usually park at that's either off the radar or whatever.

131
00:11:56,621 --> 00:12:02,365
And then folks were instructed to gather data as best they felt comfortable.

132
00:12:03,606 --> 00:12:08,869
Ideally, it involves a five-ish minute survey with whoever you encounter.

133
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,631
That being said, if you feel

134
00:12:11,271 --> 00:12:14,012
like the situation itself is not comfortable.

135
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:19,814
If you feel as though the person is sleeping, under no circumstances do you wake them up, et cetera, et cetera.

136
00:12:20,275 --> 00:12:24,776
So you just gather the data based on what you can see, where the spot was.

137
00:12:25,217 --> 00:12:34,000
If you can get an idea of roughly how old the individual is, roughly the gender of the individual, report that stuff out.

138
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:41,415
But yeah, so that's like the 25 cent version of an answer for you.

139
00:12:47,737 --> 00:12:49,097
Any other questions for Jason?

140
00:12:50,978 --> 00:13:02,602
One quick, what is in your estimate the percentage of psychiatric illness in the homeless versus economic homelessness?

141
00:13:05,331 --> 00:13:17,275
It would be hard for me to parse out the difference between the two because the like if you view it as a Venn diagram, it's almost perfectly overlapping my experience now, which comes first.

142
00:13:17,675 --> 00:13:18,675
I don't necessarily know.

143
00:13:18,735 --> 00:13:21,616
I don't necessarily know a lot of the folks in that.

144
00:13:23,476 --> 00:13:29,618
That sort of detail yet, but generally it's both economic and psychiatric.

145
00:13:29,678 --> 00:13:32,259
It's just a matter of which came worse and which is exacerbating the other.

146
00:13:34,323 --> 00:13:35,244
My experience, anyway.

147
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:41,247
Thanks, Jason.

148
00:13:41,267 --> 00:13:46,070
Thanks for letting me do it.

149
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:47,411
Proud to do it.

150
00:13:47,431 --> 00:13:47,951
1-800-STONE.

151
00:13:48,712 --> 00:13:52,594
Yeah, if I had a nickel for every time.

152
00:13:56,598 --> 00:14:05,985
So last week, we had a great meeting here in the chambers of City Hall with a lot of providers.

153
00:14:06,286 --> 00:14:15,212
We had a great speaker and a panel and that was all thanks to our OPO office, Catherine Dinger is our manager.

154
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:19,075
She did a great job, her and her team, putting this whole summit together.

155
00:14:19,095 --> 00:14:23,619
And it was about cultural connections to care, a lot of kind of what we were just talking about.

156
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,442
connections to behavioral health and substance use programming.

157
00:14:30,063 --> 00:14:40,909
I asked Catherine if she could give you the presentation, but I think it's interesting for connections to all kinds of care that we're working on right now with our community.

158
00:14:42,289 --> 00:14:45,991
Catherine, I know you were a little bit muted the last time you tried to speak.

159
00:14:46,872 --> 00:14:48,173
Can you hear me any better?

160
00:14:48,877 --> 00:14:49,777
Yeah, a little bit.

161
00:14:49,837 --> 00:14:50,498
Okay, great.

162
00:14:51,398 --> 00:14:53,418
Also home with pneumonia, just so you know.

163
00:14:53,478 --> 00:14:54,539
So, yeah.

164
00:14:54,859 --> 00:15:01,281
So the urgent care system works great at Lawrence Memorial, by the way, last night, getting my x-rays at 1030 at night.

165
00:15:01,481 --> 00:15:04,262
So thank you to the healthcare providers out there.

166
00:15:05,423 --> 00:15:07,626
But yes, home with pneumonia.

167
00:15:07,646 --> 00:15:12,232
I'm going to give you just do a brief overview.

168
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:20,061
As you know, actually, speaking of Melrose Lawrence Memorial, when they came, Melrose Wakefield did

169
00:15:20,802 --> 00:15:23,164
the site overview, they received the D.O.N.

170
00:15:23,304 --> 00:15:24,765
funds, and then the D.O.N.

171
00:15:24,825 --> 00:15:28,388
funds were put back into the communities to apply for grants.

172
00:15:28,888 --> 00:15:34,553
And the City of Medford applied for a grant to really look at these cultural connections to care.

173
00:15:35,033 --> 00:15:43,960
How are residents that maybe don't speak English, or English is their second language, and from different backgrounds accessing both

174
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,843
behavioral health care, substance abuse treatment care, and medical care.

175
00:15:48,923 --> 00:15:50,124
What are the barriers?

176
00:15:50,244 --> 00:15:57,690
So four years ago, the team under Penny's leadership started this project.

177
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:05,175
And I'm just going to give you a brief overview of their findings, and then the products of their findings.

178
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:07,176
So Mary Ann, can I share?

179
00:16:08,898 --> 00:16:11,480
Can you allow me to share my screen?

180
00:16:12,901 --> 00:16:13,281
Okay.

181
00:16:14,566 --> 00:16:29,293
And I'm going to share.

182
00:16:29,313 --> 00:16:29,353
OK.

183
00:16:31,794 --> 00:16:32,715
Hold on just a moment.

184
00:16:43,758 --> 00:17:01,287
Okay, so our community outreach team, which many of you are familiar with, is a 10-member team, and they speak Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Arabic,

185
00:17:04,288 --> 00:17:20,011
Haitian, Creole, English, and represent the BIPOC community as well, and really try to understand what are these cultural identified barriers to seek behavioral health care.

186
00:17:20,511 --> 00:17:30,273
And what they did was they hosted focus groups, they did surveys, and they had a lot of community conversations to understand really what are those barriers.

187
00:17:31,173 --> 00:17:48,295
So this project started in the spring of 2022, and they were really looking at residents that are living and working in Medford, and prioritized the experiences of BIPOC immigrants and families who speak ESOL.

188
00:17:49,942 --> 00:17:59,064
So they had toasted community conversations all over the community, and these numbers are not representative.

189
00:17:59,604 --> 00:18:06,705
Arabic-speaking community groups, Haitian Creole, and all the different language groups I talked about.

190
00:18:08,005 --> 00:18:18,007
And what they found was the barriers to behavioral health care were there's just a lot of limited awareness and the process of how to engage with behavioral health care.

191
00:18:18,727 --> 00:18:23,410
and the accessibility and cultural understanding.

192
00:18:23,771 --> 00:18:32,636
There's a lot of stigma and fear and a lot of shame, a lot of shame in accessing behavioral health care.

193
00:18:32,716 --> 00:18:42,903
And they talked a lot about the opportunities for how we could engage more and learning more to not burden family, loved ones, the community.

194
00:18:45,575 --> 00:18:57,341
They also learned that there was a lot of limited awareness around what mental and behavioral health issues are, what is worth seeking health care for.

195
00:18:57,361 --> 00:19:04,304
A lot didn't know that you can get help for things such as anxiety, depression.

196
00:19:05,725 --> 00:19:08,986
They just didn't know they were the clinical process.

197
00:19:09,086 --> 00:19:10,427
And they just have a fear of,

198
00:19:11,267 --> 00:19:19,230
of the extreme of getting held for psychiatric reasons versus the different tiered steps of behavioral health care.

199
00:19:20,691 --> 00:19:30,874
And so these were just kind of questions to consider as we need to look at this in the community, communicating what is worth seeking health care for.

200
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:40,358
Cost and affordability to care was another factor.

201
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:53,234
Long wait lists, transportation came up quite a few times, and people not having access to computers for telehealth.

202
00:19:55,931 --> 00:19:59,392
And language and cultural understanding.

203
00:20:00,653 --> 00:20:06,755
They also saw a few providers from similar cultural backgrounds.

204
00:20:07,776 --> 00:20:13,598
So we, you know, these are things that we, and we also wanna look at how things are interpreted.

205
00:20:14,578 --> 00:20:23,962
If someone just put something into Google Translate, it might not have the same intentions that it was intended to.

206
00:20:25,415 --> 00:20:40,603
They talked a lot about the barriers to behavioral health care and the stigma and fear and the fear of, you know, they're already in vulnerable situations in this country.

207
00:20:40,843 --> 00:20:51,809
And if they are connected to a system, does that put them at increased challenges for getting jobs or getting even deported?

208
00:20:51,949 --> 00:20:53,410
So that's something that,

209
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:54,836
came up.

210
00:20:56,155 --> 00:20:58,017
and then the idea of shame.

211
00:20:59,197 --> 00:21:11,406
And really, you know, we had a lot of conversations around the faith community and in these different cultural groups, how much shame comes to light.

212
00:21:12,006 --> 00:21:24,594
And what was great about the event, we, you know, what we wanted to do was after the four years of this work, we hosted a panel last week and in our panel included a lot of our community members,

213
00:21:26,296 --> 00:21:36,352
And they talked a lot about shame and how that really is one of the primary reasons and barriers to accessing behavioral health care.

214
00:21:38,684 --> 00:21:45,626
And a lot of people, you know, some of the quotes that came out were, we are Arabs, so I will say this open.

215
00:21:45,686 --> 00:21:50,447
When we have a problem, we try to solve it in secrecy.

216
00:21:51,447 --> 00:21:56,108
Another thing that came up, most Haitian families hide mental health issues and we do not seek help.

217
00:21:56,428 --> 00:21:59,609
We just deal with it until it gets to a paralyzing point.

218
00:22:00,049 --> 00:22:07,191
And so that's a theme we saw over and over again, people not getting care early enough until it got to a point where

219
00:22:07,591 --> 00:22:13,034
hospitalizations and other kind of emergencies, crisis situations.

220
00:22:13,114 --> 00:22:21,319
And we actually, our team is dealing with one of those right now where it was not dealt early enough in the schools asked us to help intervene.

221
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:36,168
And then a lot of people really looking at religious based responsibility for addressing some of the behavioral health conditions.

222
00:22:38,004 --> 00:22:46,872
So you can kind of see some of the quotes here that were really helpful in helping understand the issue.

223
00:22:46,892 --> 00:23:02,426
And we really talked about some of the opportunities, what we can do to destigmatize and increase those connections for care, supporting our personal growth and development, burdening loved ones,

224
00:23:04,688 --> 00:23:07,889
and really taking our key takeaways to the next steps.

225
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,611
So what can we do next?

226
00:23:12,571 --> 00:23:18,254
One of the things our team did was created a multilingual media campaign.

227
00:23:18,354 --> 00:23:23,116
So this was a social media campaign, and it was billboards and a print campaign.

228
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:26,997
This campaign, I'm going to go through the different languages.

229
00:23:28,078 --> 00:23:33,040
This is the English version, and you can see it in the different languages.

230
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:41,279
This campaign was social media print and a billboard on 93.

231
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:46,562
Overall, we reached well over 30,000 individuals.

232
00:23:48,262 --> 00:23:59,068
You can see the social media campaign alone reached 12,000 people, and it was in different languages, and it was pushed out through our community engagement team.

233
00:24:01,448 --> 00:24:05,250
on language-based social media channels and WhatsApp.

234
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:09,851
And that's where the conversations and sharing really happened.

235
00:24:10,211 --> 00:24:21,715
So we were delighted to see that people were not just looking at the posts, but they were engaging and commenting and even clicking on the resources.

236
00:24:21,775 --> 00:24:28,097
So our social media person was able to kind of go through and dissect and show that this

237
00:24:28,917 --> 00:24:32,229
social media campaign really had a big impact.

238
00:24:36,876 --> 00:24:39,318
So in the billboard, in the print media.

239
00:24:39,398 --> 00:24:48,765
So this was really just to kick off the conversation and last week's symposium brought together our caregivers in the area.

240
00:24:48,785 --> 00:24:59,853
And we really wanted to talk about what are our next steps in reducing the stigma and addressing these barriers that our team identified.

241
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:17,097
and we have a really good plan going forward and through our Medford Connects team, we feel like we got some great ideas last week and are gonna be able to really implement them with our community liaisons and connectors.

242
00:25:21,337 --> 00:25:23,678
So, does anyone have any questions?

243
00:25:25,272 --> 00:25:25,612
Absolutely.

244
00:25:26,072 --> 00:25:28,613
Sorry, I was going to say really, really great work.

245
00:25:28,673 --> 00:25:29,953
And I enjoyed the presentation.

246
00:25:29,973 --> 00:25:38,555
Did anyone talk about barriers to actually accessing care, behavioral health care, and what that was like?

247
00:25:38,635 --> 00:25:45,216
Or is it strictly just these resources are here and folks are not connecting to it?

248
00:25:45,376 --> 00:25:46,517
How do we get them to connect?

249
00:25:46,577 --> 00:25:51,358
Because I'll say from the state level, because I do a lot of state level work,

250
00:25:53,437 --> 00:25:57,941
one of the barriers we always hear is it's hard to find available behavioral health providers.

251
00:25:59,462 --> 00:26:03,045
Yeah, so that is definitely something that came up.

252
00:26:03,245 --> 00:26:15,335
Yeah, some people not knowing and then those that do know have reached those long wait lists, things, you know, what's great is that the state now has the

253
00:26:16,796 --> 00:26:25,480
the behavioral health centers, so the regional behavioral health centers, and then the helpline that can connect people.

254
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,462
But it still doesn't help with some of the wait lists questions.

255
00:26:31,482 --> 00:26:33,523
And insurance barriers too, we heard.

256
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:44,692
Yeah, insurance barriers, language, we have, you know, a lot of people that are coming up in the emergency shelters have been through significant trauma.

257
00:26:45,512 --> 00:26:48,195
And a lot of them don't speak any English.

258
00:26:48,255 --> 00:26:53,221
So how are they, you know, getting that behavioral health care that they need?

259
00:26:53,241 --> 00:26:54,162
So, um,

260
00:26:57,159 --> 00:27:06,766
It's great places like CHA, Elliott, Riverside, you know, a lot of our big behavioral health providers are working on this issue.

261
00:27:06,806 --> 00:27:13,551
And many of them were in attendance, and kind of really taking in what our community engagement team had to say.

262
00:27:15,113 --> 00:27:19,136
But there's, yeah, there's a lot of work that needs to be done around this.

263
00:27:21,277 --> 00:27:21,777
That's helpful.

264
00:27:21,958 --> 00:27:22,258
Thank you.

265
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:29,063
Yeah it was interesting last week too, it came up about the senior population as well, half of the Mystic Valley folks if you want to.

266
00:27:30,773 --> 00:27:34,275
Yeah, so yeah, the senior population.

267
00:27:35,136 --> 00:27:40,359
They had some really mystic Valley had some really interesting stats where I can't remember.

268
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:53,168
I have medicine brain right now, but I can't remember the exact percentage of they have a lot of great free behavioral health programs for the senior population, and I think they said that 80 to 90% are.

269
00:27:58,542 --> 00:28:03,948
utilized by Caucasian people that are white.

270
00:28:04,129 --> 00:28:11,257
So we know that non-English speaking folks are not taking advantage of those resources.

271
00:28:14,034 --> 00:28:35,092
And then the other interesting part of our panel was the faith-based community and talking about how that's something that we're working on here in Medford is working with our faith leaders to provide things like mental health first aid to deacons and church leaders and to talk about how we can encourage

272
00:28:36,273 --> 00:28:49,364
folks in the faith community to take advantage of these free trainings, but also to look at, and this is why, you know, the Board of Health is really interesting to think about this is what is that next level down of care providers like community health workers?

273
00:28:49,724 --> 00:28:59,752
How can we train them to do some of the behavioral health work at the community level to kind of build more tiers?

274
00:29:05,807 --> 00:29:08,510
I think that's it, Marion, unless there are any other questions.

275
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:09,671
Thank you, Catherine.

276
00:29:09,771 --> 00:29:10,712
Any other questions?

277
00:29:13,654 --> 00:29:15,076
Okay, so more to come on that.

278
00:29:15,376 --> 00:29:18,379
We'll keep you posted on the work being done.

279
00:29:18,419 --> 00:29:23,384
But it really was a great program last week that we all did.

280
00:29:23,684 --> 00:29:25,966
So I want you to be aware.

281
00:29:27,788 --> 00:29:28,208
Okay.

282
00:29:29,742 --> 00:29:42,825
So today we have a couple of folks joining us for the other business portion of our agenda because this just kind of actually just came up today and I wanted you to hear about it.

283
00:29:42,845 --> 00:29:53,387
I think in the past you've all heard that we're part of a regional public health excellence grant hosted by Melrose and there's five communities.

284
00:29:54,879 --> 00:29:56,841
that we're able to share resources.

285
00:29:57,421 --> 00:30:06,989
Last month we appointed Libby, who is a regional inspector as a health agent in Medford, so that she'd be able to go out and do food inspections for us here.

286
00:30:07,469 --> 00:30:11,613
So she's part of that regional grant, shared resource that we have, shared inspector.

287
00:30:11,633 --> 00:30:19,820
They also pay for education and training for inspectors so that we're all getting our competencies up and being on the same page, which is terrific.

288
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:32,984
But now we have to enter into an inter-municipal agreement, an IMA, for the Public Health Excellence Shared Services Grant Program with all the communities.

289
00:30:33,544 --> 00:30:35,625
So we have with us from the Mass.

290
00:30:35,645 --> 00:30:40,406
Association of Health Boards, Attorney Cheryl Sabara, and I think, Mike, look, Hugo, yes, hi.

291
00:30:40,566 --> 00:30:41,206
Mike, we'll see you too.

292
00:30:43,067 --> 00:30:46,028
who can explain what the IMA is all about and why we need it.

293
00:30:46,248 --> 00:30:48,749
And then we also have Deanna Wu with us.

294
00:30:49,269 --> 00:30:56,872
And Deanna is our Shared Services Coordinator who keeps us all honest and working.

295
00:30:57,232 --> 00:31:03,875
But I'd like to turn it over to Cheryl or Mike to talk a little bit about what an IMA is and why we need this now.

296
00:31:04,752 --> 00:31:12,259
Well, I can start and then Mike, you can take over because you've been working with these collaboratives more than I have.

297
00:31:12,779 --> 00:31:18,424
But this is part of an initiative from the Department of Public Health.

298
00:31:18,465 --> 00:31:25,010
I'm not sure how familiar, Marianne, your board is with the Public Health Excellence Collaborative Program.

299
00:31:25,191 --> 00:31:27,132
Are they familiar with the program?

300
00:31:28,433 --> 00:31:29,554
Okay, great.

301
00:31:29,734 --> 00:31:44,280
As you know, it's a grant program, the intent of which is to augment the public health services that the city already provides for its residents and its businesses.

302
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:55,825
The intermunicipal agreement is a contract basically that sets forth what the duties and obligations are,

303
00:31:56,445 --> 00:32:10,917
for the collaborative and it also sets up a governance board where each municipality has one vote so that the advisory board actually directs how the collaborative works.

304
00:32:11,918 --> 00:32:13,339
What are their priorities?

305
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:16,661
What are the services that they want to share?

306
00:32:18,003 --> 00:32:20,905
How the collaborative spends the grant funds?

307
00:32:21,425 --> 00:32:35,050
that come in from the Department of Public Health, and there are 51 of these collaboratives throughout the Commonwealth, and I believe it involves 320-something municipalities.

308
00:32:38,771 --> 00:32:41,772
are part of one of these collaboratives.

309
00:32:41,992 --> 00:32:54,196
And the goal is to augment services and to really balance out services so that it doesn't matter what zip code you live in, you are

310
00:32:55,317 --> 00:33:09,737
Receiving the same number of services that everyone else is so that if you live in Medford versus living in New Bedford or living in Peru, Massachusetts, everyone is entitled to.

311
00:33:11,879 --> 00:33:17,620
to very robust public health services, and this is a way to help that along.

312
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:24,862
This collaborative has been working together for quite some time, but they have not signed an inter-municipal agreement.

313
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:39,725
The reason this is necessary is because this collaborative is formed pursuant to a statute that permits shared services to happen across municipalities.

314
00:33:41,006 --> 00:33:53,993
Normally, with an agreement like this, an IMA, the chief executive officer of the city or town is the one that would be signing this.

315
00:33:54,553 --> 00:34:05,479
Because this is also public health oriented, the grant requires that the Board of Health also sign the agreement.

316
00:34:05,739 --> 00:34:08,901
The agreement really sets forth

317
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:14,487
What the obligations are, it's pretty simple.

318
00:34:15,949 --> 00:34:24,140
It talks about the admin fee that Melrose will get because Melrose is the host agent for the grant.

319
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:26,483
So Melrose collects the money.

320
00:34:27,804 --> 00:34:32,787
and signs and pays all of the invoices that the collaborative incurs.

321
00:34:33,207 --> 00:34:35,469
However, Melrose doesn't make the decisions.

322
00:34:35,549 --> 00:34:39,471
The decisions are made by the entire collaborative.

323
00:34:39,931 --> 00:34:43,573
So this is, I believe, the final agreement, Mike.

324
00:34:44,294 --> 00:34:51,658
It's been vetted, I believe, by every municipal attorney has looked at this and reviewed it.

325
00:34:52,798 --> 00:34:55,239
MHB was the primary author.

326
00:34:55,360 --> 00:35:10,807
We have a template that we've been asked by the Department of Public Health to create, and then each collaborative can add whatever needs, whatever specific sections they would like to add.

327
00:35:10,867 --> 00:35:14,609
If there's anything that's unique, then they would add that.

328
00:35:14,769 --> 00:35:21,332
I believe this is, it mentioned that the collaborative itself is the,

329
00:35:21,892 --> 00:35:34,219
governing board so they would decide who to hire, whether to hire them as employees or as independent contractors, and what kind of services that you want.

330
00:35:34,279 --> 00:35:49,127
I think either Mike or Deanna would be able to tell you what the services are that this governing board is intending to utilize.

331
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:56,244
I think Deanna, why don't you go ahead and talk about the progress that you've made and what's planned to be made at this point?

332
00:35:56,264 --> 00:35:57,185
Sure.

333
00:35:57,245 --> 00:36:10,135
So right now we're still building our team, but we do have Shelby, the inspector trainee, who's been supporting Medford, newly supporting Medford on inspections.

334
00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:13,978
And then we recently, as of

335
00:36:14,638 --> 00:36:15,479
This is her third week.

336
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:20,464
We just hired a regional epidemiologist who will help with data support.

337
00:36:21,165 --> 00:36:27,431
She could also help cover some of the communicable disease reporting that needs to get done.

338
00:36:28,592 --> 00:36:37,621
We're currently working on hiring a regional public health nurse and then have thoughts on a regional communication specialist as well.

339
00:36:40,222 --> 00:36:49,768
All together, we're hoping to offer fill-in services for people who are taking vacation or are going on medical leave and whatnot.

340
00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:55,851
And then just helping support each other through this work.

341
00:36:56,632 --> 00:36:58,833
I think about flu clinics and how

342
00:37:00,634 --> 00:37:01,494
There's a lot of it.

343
00:37:01,614 --> 00:37:03,495
It tends to be like an all hands on deck event.

344
00:37:03,515 --> 00:37:17,101
So being able to provide more people who can vaccinate or offer the counter support of covering even while the nurse, for example, is prioritizing flu clinics.

345
00:37:18,422 --> 00:37:20,343
That's that's where we are right now.

346
00:37:22,924 --> 00:37:28,606
I don't know how much how much you're aware of the participation that you're that your city has had in

347
00:37:30,116 --> 00:37:34,479
this program, but just a little bit of background.

348
00:37:34,739 --> 00:37:38,942
Your group is funded to the tune of $561,000 a year.

349
00:37:38,962 --> 00:37:47,007
The funding is completely safe from being taken back by the federal government for the next three years.

350
00:37:47,888 --> 00:37:48,428
It's all been

351
00:37:49,969 --> 00:37:51,930
All of the funds have been spoken for.

352
00:37:51,970 --> 00:38:08,437
It's funded by $200 million from ARPA, $52.6 million from a CDC grant, and another line item from the state legislature for 9.1 for this year, although in the past it's been as high as 15.

353
00:38:08,757 --> 00:38:18,522
And once we get through spending the ARPA funds and the CDC funds, we will see that number go up appreciably, hopefully, if there's

354
00:38:19,642 --> 00:38:21,783
any sense left in this world.

355
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:25,324
We'll see this program funded indefinitely.

356
00:38:26,365 --> 00:38:28,645
It's been codified.

357
00:38:29,266 --> 00:38:36,428
There is a new Chapter 111, Section 27D that's been amended as of about a month and a half ago.

358
00:38:38,009 --> 00:38:43,491
If you look it up online, you won't see it yet because they're still rolling out how it's going to be implemented.

359
00:38:45,271 --> 00:38:49,833
It requires reporting by boards of health on an annual basis.

360
00:38:50,994 --> 00:38:57,517
It requires the Department of Public Health to use those reports to ask the legislature for more money on an annual basis.

361
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:07,987
Uh, there are requirements for data collection and data usage, and those who use maven will be happy to know that.

362
00:39:09,228 --> 00:39:15,335
And if you're using maven, you already know this, but the board should know that that maven, which has always been a 1 way street.

363
00:39:16,036 --> 00:39:19,438
of your boards supplying information to the Commonwealth.

364
00:39:19,558 --> 00:39:22,819
Now that data is all being crunched and sent back to you.

365
00:39:22,899 --> 00:39:30,003
So you'll have an idea of where you stand and where the state stands on various reportable diseases.

366
00:39:31,123 --> 00:39:38,347
And so we actually have a guidance document that we've put together that's online.

367
00:39:38,367 --> 00:39:39,247
It's on our website.

368
00:39:39,287 --> 00:39:42,389
But Deanna, I'll send you a copy if you'd send it on to everybody.

369
00:39:42,729 --> 00:39:43,570
I'd appreciate that.

370
00:39:45,865 --> 00:39:49,367
that lays out what the new statute is and what your obligations are.

371
00:39:49,908 --> 00:39:53,270
You all, as board members, have an obligation to do a training.

372
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:58,373
And we, as MAHB, have an obligation to make sure that we offer that training to you.

373
00:39:58,493 --> 00:40:05,877
And our training schedule is, I think the closest one to you would be Marlborough, and that's on May 10th.

374
00:40:06,578 --> 00:40:12,581
We're doing one in Plymouth on the 4th of April, and one in Northampton on the 26th of April.

375
00:40:15,123 --> 00:40:20,830
Those are an all day Saturday thing for board members and it is going to be extremely comprehensive.

376
00:40:22,252 --> 00:40:26,657
So that's kind of the background of what the grant is and what it's bringing to you.

377
00:40:27,037 --> 00:40:31,943
And at this point, the the state has stopped.

378
00:40:32,564 --> 00:40:33,385
further funding.

379
00:40:33,625 --> 00:40:48,515
They've given each of the grant groups the first half of the funding that was given back during the summer and fall, and they're holding off on the third payment or on payment number two, which is actually the third quarter payment.

380
00:40:49,776 --> 00:40:52,358
They're holding off on that till the IMAs are all in.

381
00:40:53,578 --> 00:40:55,580
Just so you know, you're not the last one.

382
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:59,502
You're not on a bad person list of any sort.

383
00:41:00,362 --> 00:41:01,963
We're still working on about a dozen.

384
00:41:03,704 --> 00:41:06,366
I think we've got it down to 10 at this point that are left.

385
00:41:07,026 --> 00:41:14,109
Cheryl's number is right, there's 51 groups, I'm sorry, 321 cities and towns are participating.

386
00:41:14,929 --> 00:41:19,951
We're forming two more groups, one out in Western Mass, one in the northeastern part of the state.

387
00:41:21,271 --> 00:41:31,975
We may see a couple of groups get realigned and broken up, and then there are around seven or eight towns that did not take advantage of getting in, who are clamoring to get in because

388
00:41:33,075 --> 00:41:41,320
The whole new statute is not an unfunded mandate because if you are a member of a collaborative, the state's picking up the tab for everything.

389
00:41:42,581 --> 00:41:50,305
If you're not a member, the state's picking up the tab for all your trainings and your computer equipment, but there'll be other costs.

390
00:41:50,725 --> 00:41:53,707
And as a practical matter, you'll never get to the front of the line.

391
00:41:54,307 --> 00:42:04,378
on any trainings that you want your staff to go through because the PHE groups will always be able to get on and onto the waiting list ahead of anybody who's not.

392
00:42:04,879 --> 00:42:07,182
So that's basically it in a nutshell.

393
00:42:08,042 --> 00:42:12,828
And as I said, we'll send our document out to Deanna and she'll distribute it out to everybody.

394
00:42:16,023 --> 00:42:16,543
Thank you.

395
00:42:16,824 --> 00:42:18,064
Thank you, Michelle.

396
00:42:18,685 --> 00:42:22,107
And I just want to add to the trainings have been really invaluable.

397
00:42:22,127 --> 00:42:28,252
I know we have a couple of the inspectors, all three of the inspectors on, that may want to join in.

398
00:42:30,103 --> 00:42:35,324
They've also developed these training hubs so that we're able to participate.

399
00:42:35,464 --> 00:42:37,684
And our training hub is in Salem.

400
00:42:38,625 --> 00:42:56,868
And they have expert staff, technical assistance staff, that if the inspectors run into issues with food inspections or housing cases, they were able to call on the folks at the training hub to see that they come right out and they'll assist and actually go on the inspections with them.

401
00:42:57,368 --> 00:42:59,990
or they'll give them advice over the phone, whatever's needed.

402
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:01,031
So that's been really nice.

403
00:43:01,071 --> 00:43:08,657
And it's nice because as a collaborative now, we're all, and as all of these PhD grant programs, we're all gonna be on the same page.

404
00:43:08,998 --> 00:43:13,822
Like Cheryl alluded to, providing the same level of service, consistent.

405
00:43:14,382 --> 00:43:19,566
So especially if you have a restaurant chain that has a place in Medford and a place,

406
00:43:20,957 --> 00:43:25,838
and new that they're both going to get the same inspection and they're both going to have the same information.

407
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:29,438
So it's really consistency to across the board.

408
00:43:29,458 --> 00:43:30,239
That's really great.

409
00:43:30,279 --> 00:43:32,339
But I think the trainings have been invaluable.

410
00:43:33,699 --> 00:43:41,340
You know, we don't always have a large budget in the city for attending seminars and programming, and that's really useful.

411
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:45,661
And thanks to PHE inspectors have been able to go to a lot of them.

412
00:43:45,961 --> 00:43:50,602
And I think Z is going next week to, where are you going?

413
00:43:54,197 --> 00:43:54,679
Holyoke.

414
00:43:55,641 --> 00:43:57,906
She's going to Holyoke for DEP training.

415
00:43:59,425 --> 00:44:04,788
The expenses for all of that are covered by this grant program as well.

416
00:44:05,608 --> 00:44:18,374
The program was actually developed as a result of the conclusions that were found in the special commission on local and regional health that met for several years.

417
00:44:18,634 --> 00:44:23,116
We developed a blueprint for public health excellence.

418
00:44:23,416 --> 00:44:25,257
What we found is that

419
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:40,782
at the time that the commission was formed, which was back, I'm going to say about seven or eight years ago, that there was really an inability of a lot of cities and towns to meet

420
00:44:41,222 --> 00:44:50,970
The statutory and regulatory minimum standards that boards of health are supposed to be supplying to their residents.

421
00:44:52,472 --> 00:44:56,835
So the goal, the initial goal of the blueprint was to.

422
00:44:58,396 --> 00:45:16,688
Get all cities and towns up to that those minimum standards and once that's accomplished, then we would look at foundational public health services and look at the array of services that board should be providing either themselves or through other.

423
00:45:17,528 --> 00:45:23,952
community-based organizations or hospitals or whoever the clinical partners might be.

424
00:45:24,473 --> 00:45:29,396
So the new law that Mike mentioned really codifies that report.

425
00:45:29,876 --> 00:45:40,863
And if you want to see that report or the executive summary of that report, you can just Google Blueprint for public health excellence in Massachusetts and you'll find it.

426
00:45:41,283 --> 00:45:44,385
Or I'll attach it to the same email so that they get it.

427
00:45:45,106 --> 00:45:45,446
Or that.

428
00:45:46,206 --> 00:45:46,467
Or that.

429
00:45:47,382 --> 00:45:50,786
Of course, the best thing is that your dues for MHB are paid for by the grant.

430
00:45:52,133 --> 00:45:54,255
That's the best benefit, I think.

431
00:45:54,875 --> 00:46:02,701
I do this for a membership and a lot of social stuff, but also, again, that's something, you know, cities and towns can't always afford to be able to do.

432
00:46:02,961 --> 00:46:04,061
It's very helpful for us.

433
00:46:05,182 --> 00:46:18,211
So just the, we have, with us, besides Bedford, we have Malden, Melrose, Stoneham, Winchester, and Wakefield, who are part of our public health excellence grant, our shared services program.

434
00:46:20,291 --> 00:46:36,986
And we've worked together it's it's great because, you know, as a group we've worked together on emergency preparedness and so we're very familiar with working with each other, and it's a pretty great, great group to work but so, and Dan has been a huge help because now we are going into the.

435
00:46:38,748 --> 00:46:52,781
Foundations of public health services and that's a lot of work ahead of us with the data that we need to collect and see where we're at as far as being able to meet those a little bit different for us here in Massachusetts because we don't operate on the county level.

436
00:46:52,821 --> 00:46:56,044
So some of the services are a little bit like maternal child health.

437
00:46:56,865 --> 00:47:07,054
It's not something that we can do directly, but we certainly can make sure that it's here present in Medford, whether it be through, like Cheryl had said, community-based organizations or the hospital.

438
00:47:07,694 --> 00:47:14,200
So yeah, so that's what's in front of us now, and really connections to care again is huge.

439
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,742
So that's gonna be part of the foundation of public health services.

440
00:47:18,558 --> 00:47:25,922
and so that was a lot, but along the shot of it, Dr. Kladowicz, I'm going to ask each of you to sign this IMA.

441
00:47:25,962 --> 00:47:32,044
So I will be sending it over to you, the mayor, and you will have to sign on.

442
00:47:34,625 --> 00:47:49,029
And it's a 19 page document and it's pretty detailed and outlines, you know, who the membership is, who the governing bodies are, what Melrose's responsibilities are as the lead agency and the fiscal agent.

443
00:47:50,349 --> 00:47:56,071
But it's, so it's, I think it's very detailed and covers everything we need to cover.

444
00:47:58,510 --> 00:48:00,851
Don't be too frightened about those 19 pages.

445
00:48:00,931 --> 00:48:03,772
Several of those pages are just signature pages.

446
00:48:04,972 --> 00:48:07,833
The bulk of it is 8 pages.

447
00:48:09,613 --> 00:48:16,095
Is there any auditing mechanism in place to audit the funds flow through Melrose?

448
00:48:16,774 --> 00:48:17,114
Yes.

449
00:48:17,514 --> 00:48:19,855
Make sure they go where they're supposed to go.

450
00:48:20,095 --> 00:48:20,355
Yes.

451
00:48:20,615 --> 00:48:24,956
It's in the bulk of, it's in the meat of the grant.

452
00:48:24,976 --> 00:48:25,557
You'll see it.

453
00:48:25,697 --> 00:48:29,898
It's in, and everything's public and DPH is auditing this constantly.

454
00:48:29,918 --> 00:48:30,238
Oh, good.

455
00:48:30,498 --> 00:48:30,698
Good.

456
00:48:31,498 --> 00:48:31,678
Yeah.

457
00:48:31,798 --> 00:48:32,458
It's a grant.

458
00:48:32,538 --> 00:48:39,780
So the, the towns and the cities and towns have to agree to do certain things in order to receive that money.

459
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,581
And the host agent is responsible.

460
00:48:41,977 --> 00:48:43,657
for making sure those things are done.

461
00:48:44,218 --> 00:48:49,539
And there's a grant manager at DPH, and there's a DPH liaison who has this region.

462
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:50,119
So yeah.

463
00:48:50,139 --> 00:48:54,701
I just want to make sure we have someone to make sure that they are doing what they're supposed to do.

464
00:48:54,781 --> 00:48:55,901
Absolutely.

465
00:48:55,921 --> 00:48:57,041
In Melrose.

466
00:48:57,061 --> 00:48:57,141
Yeah.

467
00:48:57,161 --> 00:48:57,241
Okay.

468
00:48:57,421 --> 00:49:01,903
One of the most stringent provisions in their data is that

469
00:49:02,723 --> 00:49:07,627
the funds are being given to supplement, not supplant existing programs and funds.

470
00:49:07,927 --> 00:49:22,798
So if your mayor says, you know what, next year we're gonna cut the health budget by X number of dollars because we're getting this service from the grant, that won't fly with DPH, they can't cut your funding.

471
00:49:24,099 --> 00:49:25,420
If you're getting a duplicate,

472
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:31,441
duplicate service, they'd have to keep the funding in your health department to be used somewhere else in the health department.

473
00:49:31,502 --> 00:49:39,604
They can't go painting highway stripes and putting new stoplights up with your money as long as you're part of this grant program.

474
00:49:42,064 --> 00:49:44,045
Which is why the mayor has to sign off on it.

475
00:49:47,196 --> 00:49:51,758
It does come up and I'll just say this because you are the board.

476
00:49:52,758 --> 00:50:07,782
If you're starting to feel that that's happening, give Cheryl or me a call and we will help you to describe or to discuss what the obligations of your city are.

477
00:50:08,397 --> 00:50:11,300
Yeah, so I'm not worried about shortchange in Mefford.

478
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:15,064
I'm worried about being shortchanged by the people receiving the money.

479
00:50:15,405 --> 00:50:21,552
Historically, that's been an issue with the hospital, so that's why I'm very cautious about that.

480
00:50:21,712 --> 00:50:27,098
And I would recommend we double down on that to make sure that that happens.

481
00:50:27,547 --> 00:50:27,747
Yeah.

482
00:50:28,067 --> 00:50:34,609
And that's why the advisory board is set up the way it is, where it's equal representation.

483
00:50:35,409 --> 00:50:43,671
We're struggling with one of the IMAs where, you know, the host thinks that they are in charge of everything and they're not.

484
00:50:44,892 --> 00:50:45,152
Yeah.

485
00:50:45,312 --> 00:50:46,412
I've been subjected to that.

486
00:50:46,432 --> 00:50:47,532
That's what I'm talking about.

487
00:50:47,792 --> 00:50:47,973
Yeah.

488
00:50:48,313 --> 00:50:48,513
Yeah.

489
00:50:50,053 --> 00:50:50,213
Yeah.

490
00:50:51,093 --> 00:50:53,734
Don't hesitate to call us if you're starting to feel that way.

491
00:50:53,774 --> 00:50:54,014
Sure.

492
00:50:55,295 --> 00:50:55,595
You bet.

493
00:51:00,463 --> 00:51:03,944
Any other questions or thoughts or considerations?

494
00:51:04,785 --> 00:51:11,547
Deanna also has to report quarterly to the state on how the money's being spent and where it's going, so.

495
00:51:11,987 --> 00:51:14,328
Yeah, lots of checks and balances in place.

496
00:51:15,228 --> 00:51:26,252
Just one quick thing, I forgot to add that the grant is also, we got a one-time approval to pay for the YRBS administration, so we're gonna support the YRBS administration in Medford and the other five communities as well.

497
00:51:26,292 --> 00:51:29,853
This is great news.

498
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:39,904
So I will have this sent over to you, Dr. Miles, for your review and signature, and then send it up to the mayor's office as well.

499
00:51:42,045 --> 00:51:46,468
And thank you, Cheryl and Mike and Deanna for joining in at short notice.

500
00:51:46,568 --> 00:51:51,350
I know it was short notice to describe this, but I didn't want it to wait another month.

501
00:51:51,370 --> 00:51:52,451
So I'm glad you're there.

502
00:51:52,691 --> 00:51:53,291
My pleasure.

503
00:51:53,331 --> 00:51:56,973
And if Jason is new to you guys, you've got a good one now, let me tell you.

504
00:51:58,962 --> 00:52:07,249
And if you could just send us an email with a couple of choice documents that we should be aware of, that would help me a lot.

505
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:14,275
Instead of having to fish through like one or two things I should know about and a website or document, whatever it is.

506
00:52:14,675 --> 00:52:21,841
Okay, so what I'm gonna send you, doctor, is the- Give me the three document, the must read documents that bring me up to speed with this stuff.

507
00:52:22,462 --> 00:52:23,883
Okay, we got you covered.

508
00:52:24,063 --> 00:52:24,403
Okay.

509
00:52:24,764 --> 00:52:24,944
Cool.

510
00:52:25,648 --> 00:52:26,708
have a motion to adjourn.

511
00:52:26,728 --> 00:52:27,768
We have a motion to

512
00:52:55,659 --> 00:52:57,381
Motion to adjourn at 1.29.

513
00:52:58,241 --> 00:52:59,603
Thank you very much, second?

514
00:53:02,005 --> 00:53:02,965
Second, Cathy.

515
00:53:03,446 --> 00:53:05,167
Thank you, Cathy, take a roll.

516
00:53:05,688 --> 00:53:06,449
Dr. Plowitz?

517
00:53:06,749 --> 00:53:07,049
Yes.

518
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:08,991
Cathy Chabonier?

519
00:53:09,351 --> 00:53:09,591
Yes.

520
00:53:10,532 --> 00:53:11,213
And Jenny Beitel?

521
00:53:11,613 --> 00:53:11,893
Yes.

522
00:53:12,794 --> 00:53:14,055
Thank you very much, everyone.

523
00:53:14,075 --> 00:53:14,956
Thank you.

524
00:53:14,996 --> 00:53:15,897
Spring's coming.

525
00:53:16,377 --> 00:53:17,278
I hope so.

526
00:53:17,658 --> 00:53:18,099
Take care.
