1
00:23:17,888 --> 00:23:19,209
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you might have to turn it.

2
00:23:19,849 --> 00:23:20,930
[SPEAKER_02]: You got it?

3
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:21,710
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

4
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:25,833
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

5
00:23:26,973 --> 00:23:33,437
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Chair, please call the roll.

6
00:23:34,418 --> 00:23:35,258
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Callahan.

00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:39,841
[SPEAKER_14]: Present.

00:23:41,862 --> 00:23:42,463
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Leming.

10
00:23:42,483 --> 00:23:43,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Present.

11
00:23:44,004 --> 00:23:44,684
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Moline.

12
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,281
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scarpelli?

13
00:23:47,802 --> 00:23:48,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Present.

14
00:23:49,503 --> 00:23:50,044
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Tseng?

15
00:23:50,064 --> 00:23:50,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Present.

16
00:23:51,145 --> 00:23:51,746
[SPEAKER_08]: President Bears?

17
00:23:52,086 --> 00:23:52,487
[SPEAKER_08]: Present.

18
00:23:52,567 --> 00:23:53,868
[SPEAKER_08]: Seven present, none absent.

19
00:23:53,888 --> 00:23:54,989
[SPEAKER_08]: The meeting is called to order.

20
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:58,954
[SPEAKER_08]: Action and discussion items 26-014, presented by Mayor Breanna Lungo-Koehn.

21
00:23:59,556 --> 00:24:02,819
[SPEAKER_08]: Community Preservation Committee fiscal 26 appropriation requests.

22
00:24:02,979 --> 00:24:10,405
[SPEAKER_08]: We have before us the presentation of the CPC's fiscal year 2026 community projects.

23
00:24:10,745 --> 00:24:17,591
[SPEAKER_08]: We have an executive summary before us and I won't take too much of Teresa's thunder.

24
00:24:18,552 --> 00:24:24,697
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll just say that we are appropriating approximately

25
00:24:26,252 --> 00:24:30,074
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know what, Teresa, I'm just going to let you do it, because these charts, I'm not sure exactly.

26
00:24:30,134 --> 00:24:33,976
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you explain to us the overall amount, and then we'll go through the projects, and then we'll go from there.

27
00:24:34,637 --> 00:24:34,897
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

28
00:24:35,437 --> 00:24:36,898
[SPEAKER_08]: Here you go.

29
00:24:36,958 --> 00:24:37,738
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening, everybody.

30
00:24:37,798 --> 00:24:38,399
[SPEAKER_15]: Teresa DuPont.

31
00:24:38,419 --> 00:24:41,200
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm the Community Preservation Act Manager for the City of Medford.

32
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:46,783
[SPEAKER_15]: Tonight, we're requesting the appropriation in an amount of about $2.4 million.

33
00:24:48,144 --> 00:24:53,127
[SPEAKER_15]: This is spread over 11 awards that we'll be reviewing tonight for the council.

34
00:24:55,267 --> 00:24:55,927
[SPEAKER_08]: Fantastic.

35
00:24:56,008 --> 00:24:56,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

36
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:59,850
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw this 2.6 and then I wasn't sure if that was, and it's 2.4.

37
00:25:00,931 --> 00:25:01,151
[SPEAKER_15]: It is 2.4.

38
00:25:01,491 --> 00:25:11,418
[SPEAKER_15]: And just to explain that really quick, we do like to keep a reserve of $225,000 from our budget just for any off-cycle or small grant applications that come through.

39
00:25:11,758 --> 00:25:14,440
[SPEAKER_15]: We never like to be zero just in case.

40
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:20,444
[SPEAKER_15]: And just so everybody understands, that reserve money, even if we do not spend it, it gets rolled over to next year.

41
00:25:20,604 --> 00:25:21,504
[SPEAKER_15]: We can spend it next year.

42
00:25:22,245 --> 00:25:23,606
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's just a rainy day fund to have.

43
00:25:24,308 --> 00:25:39,741
[SPEAKER_08]: And just if anyone watching isn't sure, our Community Preservation Committee reviews applications and makes recommendations to the City Council to approve appropriations in the areas of open space and recreation, historic preservation and affordable housing.

44
00:25:40,982 --> 00:25:46,807
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think, and Roberta, you can correct me if I'm wrong, is this our 10th year of, or 11th maybe?

45
00:25:48,021 --> 00:25:48,281
[SPEAKER_08]: Nine.

46
00:25:48,521 --> 00:25:48,822
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

47
00:25:49,102 --> 00:25:50,363
[SPEAKER_15]: Next year will be the big year.

48
00:25:50,383 --> 00:25:50,623
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

49
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:54,386
[SPEAKER_08]: So these funds have gone a long way for our community.

50
00:25:54,806 --> 00:26:01,812
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a surcharge on the property tax bill and we also receive a portion of the funds as state matching funds to help support these projects.

51
00:26:01,912 --> 00:26:09,318
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that I will let Teresa present along with our many wonderful applicants these projects.

52
00:26:09,438 --> 00:26:09,678
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

53
00:26:09,998 --> 00:26:10,298
[SPEAKER_15]: Excellent.

54
00:26:10,619 --> 00:26:20,286
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm actually going to take one out of order, if I may, as for the executive summary, only because we are joined by the Medford Athletics team here, the baseball team.

55
00:26:21,187 --> 00:26:23,048
[SPEAKER_15]: So we will first review.

56
00:26:23,308 --> 00:26:24,929
[SPEAKER_08]: Jim, can you take a video?

57
00:26:24,949 --> 00:26:25,910
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you show them on video?

58
00:26:26,871 --> 00:26:26,951
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh.

59
00:26:28,392 --> 00:26:28,892
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on up.

60
00:26:29,473 --> 00:26:32,315
[SPEAKER_15]: If you want to stand behind me while I talk about the project, that's up to you.

61
00:26:32,395 --> 00:26:33,216
[SPEAKER_15]: When he gets there.

62
00:26:33,256 --> 00:26:34,036
[SPEAKER_15]: Completely up to you.

63
00:26:34,056 --> 00:26:34,537
[SPEAKER_08]: There we go.

64
00:26:34,597 --> 00:26:35,818
[SPEAKER_15]: I like the enthusiasm.

65
00:26:35,878 --> 00:26:36,838
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

66
00:26:36,918 --> 00:26:37,919
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for being here, guys.

67
00:26:37,979 --> 00:26:38,640
[SPEAKER_08]: It's appreciated.

68
00:26:39,284 --> 00:26:42,785
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, so this project, ooh, excellent, excellent job there.

69
00:26:43,225 --> 00:26:49,226
[SPEAKER_15]: This project would see a digital baseball scoreboard to be installed at Mombo Cat Field, which is located at Playstead Park.

70
00:26:49,646 --> 00:26:54,327
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to commend Coach Oz for being so diligent in bringing this project forward.

71
00:26:54,787 --> 00:26:57,388
[SPEAKER_15]: A few years, this is the year we can actually make it happen.

72
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:58,568
[SPEAKER_15]: We're very excited for that.

73
00:26:59,568 --> 00:27:03,389
[SPEAKER_15]: They have requested and the CPC has recommended the funds of $100,000, again, to install a digital

74
00:27:07,037 --> 00:27:08,179
[SPEAKER_15]: baseball scoreboard.

75
00:27:08,199 --> 00:27:14,852
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if coach wouldn't like to add anything additional if this council has any questions about the project.

76
00:27:16,075 --> 00:27:17,097
[SPEAKER_08]: We'd love to hear from you coach.

77
00:27:23,102 --> 00:27:23,422
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing?

78
00:27:23,462 --> 00:27:25,284
[SPEAKER_00]: My name's Orazio Azzarello.

79
00:27:25,304 --> 00:27:26,485
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the head baseball coach.

80
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:34,551
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been at Medford High School since 2021, and been an assistant here since 2012, and a graduate of Medford High School in 1995.

81
00:27:34,891 --> 00:27:35,832
[SPEAKER_00]: Showing my age here.

82
00:27:35,872 --> 00:27:39,114
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to thank you for the opportunity here.

83
00:27:39,735 --> 00:27:42,156
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm here to answer any questions.

84
00:27:42,196 --> 00:27:45,959
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have the company here that is willing to answer any questions as well.

85
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:50,963
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, if you could just tell us 30 seconds what this would mean for your team, we'd love to hear it.

86
00:27:50,983 --> 00:27:52,044
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm sure the residents would too.

87
00:27:52,414 --> 00:27:55,776
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think it means a lot to a lot of people in this community.

88
00:27:56,776 --> 00:28:02,039
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd have to say the Mombo-Kett Field is something that's been on for a long time there.

89
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:16,488
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought that a school board to just represent that family, represent the alumni, also just bringing Medford together, it was something that Mombo-Kett Field hasn't had.

90
00:28:16,908 --> 00:28:18,689
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this is a great opportunity

91
00:28:19,329 --> 00:28:22,071
[SPEAKER_00]: to show what Medford's all about, about coming together.

92
00:28:22,111 --> 00:28:27,814
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I say coming together, a lot of people had their hands in this pot here, and there's a lot of people to thank.

93
00:28:28,114 --> 00:28:29,295
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I was leading the charge.

94
00:28:29,897 --> 00:28:41,442
[SPEAKER_00]: but we did have a lot of parts and pieces that try to put this together and I'm proud to say that we're here today because of those members, those committees, parents and alumni.

95
00:28:42,663 --> 00:28:51,987
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a great opportunity for us to come together and hopefully this school board will stand out and maybe someday we'll have a new baseball field as well, so we'll see what happens.

96
00:28:52,742 --> 00:28:53,663
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, thank you coach.

97
00:28:53,924 --> 00:28:59,871
[SPEAKER_08]: Any questions for Teresa or our coach or maybe even the team on this project?

98
00:29:03,776 --> 00:29:05,979
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none, thank you for the presentation and thanks for coming down.

99
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:06,440
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

100
00:29:16,737 --> 00:29:17,918
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, shifting back.

101
00:29:18,598 --> 00:29:22,981
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, this will be taken largely in order on the executive summary for those following along.

102
00:29:23,921 --> 00:29:27,083
[SPEAKER_15]: Next up, we have Tufts Park field lighting improvements.

103
00:29:27,803 --> 00:29:31,045
[SPEAKER_15]: This was brought to the CPC by the recreation director, Kevin Bailey.

104
00:29:31,085 --> 00:29:32,266
[SPEAKER_15]: Unfortunately, he has a conflict.

105
00:29:32,306 --> 00:29:36,828
[SPEAKER_15]: He's down the hall at the Parks Commission meeting, but he has asked for me to speak on behalf of the project.

106
00:29:37,589 --> 00:29:38,269
[SPEAKER_15]: Excuse me.

107
00:29:38,811 --> 00:29:43,475
[SPEAKER_15]: He had first brought a full lighting project for the entire park to the CPC.

108
00:29:43,535 --> 00:29:46,398
[SPEAKER_15]: However, that just ended up being cost prohibitive.

109
00:29:46,438 --> 00:29:50,782
[SPEAKER_15]: It was close to a million dollars to do a full lighting rehab of this park.

110
00:29:51,322 --> 00:29:58,789
[SPEAKER_15]: So he went back to the drawing board and decided, through reviewing permitting and usage, field number two.

111
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:01,051
[SPEAKER_15]: At Tufts Park.

112
00:30:01,531 --> 00:30:06,654
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're going to be putting in lighting just for field to as well as along.

113
00:30:06,734 --> 00:30:07,715
[SPEAKER_15]: What is that Marston.

114
00:30:07,915 --> 00:30:09,015
[SPEAKER_15]: No it's not Marston.

115
00:30:09,676 --> 00:30:10,236
[SPEAKER_15]: I apologize.

116
00:30:10,276 --> 00:30:13,038
[SPEAKER_15]: I have it in front of me and I should have just used my presentation.

117
00:30:14,618 --> 00:30:18,681
[SPEAKER_15]: So this would be Moscow lighting that is able to be.

118
00:30:20,001 --> 00:30:23,924
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry I just saw George Scarpelli Councilor Scarpelli.

119
00:30:24,304 --> 00:30:25,925
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you want to you want to go Georgia.

120
00:30:26,365 --> 00:30:27,786
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to finish it out Teresa and then we'll go.

121
00:30:29,134 --> 00:30:29,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no, I'm sorry.

122
00:30:30,056 --> 00:30:32,039
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was more now, I believe.

123
00:30:32,099 --> 00:30:33,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so a lot more now.

124
00:30:34,003 --> 00:30:34,604
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thanks.

125
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:35,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry about that.

126
00:30:35,983 --> 00:30:36,623
[SPEAKER_15]: Of course.

127
00:30:37,223 --> 00:30:48,026
[SPEAKER_15]: So Musco lighting is able to be controlled by an app, which is leaps and bounds over most of the older lighting that we have in our parks right now, which is a manual process to turn the lights on or schedule them.

128
00:30:48,646 --> 00:30:55,147
[SPEAKER_15]: So this would allow for staff to have some flexibility with turning lights on and off without actually having to physically go down to the park.

129
00:30:55,948 --> 00:31:02,769
[SPEAKER_15]: I will say that Carr Park, as well as Gillis Field, so there are newer fields that have had improvements lately, have also had Musco lighting.

130
00:31:02,809 --> 00:31:05,530
[SPEAKER_15]: So this is a move to try and get all of our park lighting

131
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,891
[SPEAKER_15]: under a consistent use umbrella.

132
00:31:10,473 --> 00:31:15,736
[SPEAKER_15]: At Tufts Park, field number two is the one that's closest to the parking lot.

133
00:31:16,216 --> 00:31:17,617
[SPEAKER_15]: That one is the larger of the fields.

134
00:31:17,697 --> 00:31:20,399
[SPEAKER_15]: It's used by JV as well as a lot of our adult leagues.

135
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:22,580
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a heavily used field at Tufts Park.

136
00:31:24,288 --> 00:31:27,869
[SPEAKER_15]: And again this was a request for four hundred and thirty two thousand dollars.

137
00:31:28,409 --> 00:31:34,211
[SPEAKER_15]: This would also allow for lighting of the entire park which is ultimately the goal just for cost reasons.

138
00:31:34,251 --> 00:31:35,651
[SPEAKER_15]: We couldn't afford to do that this year.

139
00:31:36,631 --> 00:31:40,932
[SPEAKER_15]: This would allow for future phases to add similar lighting into that system.

140
00:31:41,012 --> 00:31:43,793
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's all you know one cohesive system.

141
00:31:46,625 --> 00:32:06,201
[SPEAKER_04]: there's any questions from the council great uh councilor star pelly thank you uh president bears and thank you very much stew point i think um this is something that's a must here in medford i think that uh neighboring communities and i will tell you in my profession in somerville all of our fields of musco lighting um

142
00:32:08,423 --> 00:32:12,966
[SPEAKER_04]: And the savings they bring to the community, you'll see in the long run.

143
00:32:14,667 --> 00:32:25,894
[SPEAKER_04]: The nights that the lights are left open and residents are upset that the lights are down, the lights are up and we can't get anybody to turn them on or to turn them off.

144
00:32:25,954 --> 00:32:31,538
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a phone call and it's a satellite just to shut them down.

145
00:32:31,618 --> 00:32:33,359
[SPEAKER_04]: And it really plays a huge impact.

146
00:32:33,879 --> 00:32:38,142
[SPEAKER_04]: And the quality of both the people that are participating and the neighbors.

147
00:32:38,222 --> 00:32:46,947
[SPEAKER_04]: So it really supports a quality of life and I'm glad we're moving to that that process because I know there is other cost factors that.

148
00:32:48,768 --> 00:32:55,034
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, someone has to turn those lights off if they're left on at 10 o'clock at night, if they have to be done manually, and that's a cost.

149
00:32:55,134 --> 00:33:04,203
[SPEAKER_04]: So once we have all of our parks with the Musco system and having that capability would be a huge benefit.

150
00:33:04,243 --> 00:33:08,187
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you for bringing this forward and I appreciate it.

151
00:33:10,449 --> 00:33:16,354
[SPEAKER_15]: If I may, I'd also like, uh, Councilor Scarpelli just jogged my memory on something, too, that I wanted to point out.

152
00:33:16,734 --> 00:33:20,817
[SPEAKER_15]: This lighting would also have a benefit to the immediate abutters of the park.

153
00:33:21,137 --> 00:33:28,843
[SPEAKER_15]: There has been a common complaint of light pollution washing out into yards, through windows, because, again, this is an older-style light fixture.

154
00:33:29,583 --> 00:33:40,952
[SPEAKER_15]: The new lighting allows you to manipulate the iris in a very cool way so we can eliminate that light spillage that's happening in some of the immediate abutters that are close to field two.

155
00:33:44,295 --> 00:33:44,475
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

156
00:33:44,495 --> 00:33:46,456
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we have any further questions on this project?

157
00:33:49,499 --> 00:33:50,620
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none, let's go to the next.

158
00:33:52,263 --> 00:33:58,651
[SPEAKER_15]: Next up I will I am going to skip Oak Grove just for a hot second and then take Barry Park's community garden.

159
00:33:58,671 --> 00:34:03,037
[SPEAKER_15]: I am joined by Liz White from the Community Garden Commission.

160
00:34:03,578 --> 00:34:09,265
[SPEAKER_15]: They are seeking fifty seven thousand five hundred to build a new community garden at Barry Park.

161
00:34:10,103 --> 00:34:15,705
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to give Liz the opportunity to share some words, but this is a project that has been long in the making.

162
00:34:15,865 --> 00:34:20,946
[SPEAKER_15]: I think this started in 2018, so it's time.

163
00:34:21,466 --> 00:34:28,548
[SPEAKER_15]: They are working through a very long wait list for community gardeners, so the demand is there to expand our community gardens.

164
00:34:29,169 --> 00:34:30,009
[SPEAKER_15]: So Liz, I don't want to...

165
00:34:30,669 --> 00:34:34,252
[SPEAKER_12]: steal your thunder, but if you have anything for anything like that.

166
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:35,312
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

167
00:34:35,553 --> 00:34:44,399
[SPEAKER_12]: As Teresa mentioned, we have a wait list of over 200 people right now, and we only have about 70 plots in the city.

168
00:34:44,479 --> 00:34:47,201
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is something we're really excited about.

169
00:34:47,561 --> 00:34:52,505
[SPEAKER_12]: And as she mentioned before, it was proposed back in 2018 and it was not approved.

170
00:34:52,625 --> 00:34:58,089
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're so thankful to the CPC and the Parks and Recreation

171
00:34:58,669 --> 00:35:00,570
[SPEAKER_12]: commission for approving this.

172
00:35:02,011 --> 00:35:02,351
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

173
00:35:03,492 --> 00:35:08,194
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think you're going to hear any opposition to community gardens here, but do we have any questions?

174
00:35:08,735 --> 00:35:10,576
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll go to Council Vice President Lazzaro.

175
00:35:14,518 --> 00:35:14,998
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

176
00:35:15,158 --> 00:35:20,882
[SPEAKER_14]: Can anybody give me who was on the council last time it was proposed?

177
00:35:20,922 --> 00:35:24,104
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you give me some background on why it was not approved last time?

178
00:35:26,305 --> 00:35:26,465
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

179
00:35:27,347 --> 00:35:28,808
[SPEAKER_12]: It never quite made it this far.

180
00:35:29,248 --> 00:35:33,830
[SPEAKER_12]: My understanding is that it was not approved by the Parks and Recreation Commission.

181
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:51,878
[SPEAKER_12]: And there was some opposition from neighbors who were concerned about the, I think, the visual aesthetics of it and also the possibility of rats, which we have measures in place at all of our community gardens and they are

182
00:35:52,438 --> 00:36:00,359
[SPEAKER_12]: not currently a problem, and there are things, you know, if they do, if they are present, there are things that we can do to eliminate them.

183
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:06,521
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I'm happy to hear that.

184
00:36:06,541 --> 00:36:18,923
[SPEAKER_14]: I would also just mention, if anybody has any thoughts or concerns about that, that we've recently passed a ribbon control ordinance and an overgrowth ordinance that may contribute to helping with any concerns around that

185
00:36:20,423 --> 00:36:25,744
[SPEAKER_14]: around rats in relation to gardens.

186
00:36:25,804 --> 00:36:34,426
[SPEAKER_12]: But I don't think that's usually the thing that would... No, we actually have pretty strict guidelines in terms of what can be grown and when things should be cut back.

187
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:40,367
[SPEAKER_12]: And we monitor it before we close the gardens down for the winter.

188
00:36:40,447 --> 00:36:42,988
[SPEAKER_12]: We always make sure everything is cleaned up to

189
00:36:43,963 --> 00:36:46,748
[SPEAKER_12]: prevent any type of infestation.

190
00:36:47,229 --> 00:36:49,935
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, and I don't think there have been any problems in the other community gardens.

191
00:36:50,195 --> 00:36:51,077
[SPEAKER_14]: Have there that you're aware of?

192
00:36:51,137 --> 00:36:51,317
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

193
00:36:51,478 --> 00:36:51,718
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

194
00:36:52,059 --> 00:36:52,299
[SPEAKER_14]: Awesome.

195
00:36:52,319 --> 00:36:52,940
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I think that's great.

196
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:54,210
[SPEAKER_12]: sorry.

197
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:56,051
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, that's that's that's fine.

198
00:36:56,071 --> 00:36:56,792
[SPEAKER_14]: Please, please.

199
00:36:56,832 --> 00:36:58,333
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I'd love to hear your thing.

200
00:36:58,353 --> 00:37:00,794
[SPEAKER_12]: We have no evidence of nesting rats.

201
00:37:00,834 --> 00:37:03,556
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, that's like I'm a member of the Winthrop Street Community Garden.

202
00:37:03,836 --> 00:37:14,902
[SPEAKER_12]: And yes, there are critters that come and eat our vegetables, but I've seen bunnies, I've seen chipmunks, but we have no evidence of nesting rats in the gardens.

203
00:37:15,542 --> 00:37:16,083
[SPEAKER_14]: Awesome.

204
00:37:16,103 --> 00:37:16,623
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, great.

205
00:37:16,663 --> 00:37:17,223
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you so much.

206
00:37:17,984 --> 00:37:18,244
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

207
00:37:18,684 --> 00:37:19,125
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

208
00:37:19,925 --> 00:37:23,107
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm loathe to bring up trash in this community right now.

209
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:23,347
[SPEAKER_08]: But

210
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:27,228
[SPEAKER_08]: I will say that the main thing we've learned in all of our years is that it's not gardens.

211
00:37:27,748 --> 00:37:31,291
[SPEAKER_08]: It is open trash and dumpsters that brings rats to our community.

212
00:37:31,431 --> 00:37:38,196
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you see an open dumpster or a trash can without a lid, that is something you might want to talk to your neighbor about.

213
00:37:39,918 --> 00:37:40,818
[SPEAKER_08]: It's probably not the garden.

214
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.

215
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,801
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything else on the garden?

216
00:37:44,821 --> 00:37:47,644
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

217
00:37:47,684 --> 00:37:48,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none, thank you so much.

218
00:37:48,745 --> 00:37:48,925
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

219
00:37:49,005 --> 00:37:49,325
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

220
00:37:51,387 --> 00:37:52,888
[SPEAKER_08]: Is Brooks Estate archaeological?

221
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:59,732
[SPEAKER_15]: We're actually gonna skip back, so I'm trying to get us back in order, to the Oak Grove Cemetery Historic Section.

222
00:37:59,752 --> 00:38:02,593
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you're looking at Berry Park, flip it over, it's right there.

223
00:38:03,593 --> 00:38:11,456
[SPEAKER_15]: So I am joined in the council chambers by chairperson of the cemetery trustees, Stacey Clayton, as well as member Dee Morris.

224
00:38:11,896 --> 00:38:16,938
[SPEAKER_15]: This project would, actually it's kind of an augmentation to a previous CPA award.

225
00:38:17,758 --> 00:38:24,861
[SPEAKER_15]: There is a section of Oak Grove Cemetery, the World War I memorial, that is right on the corner of Placedead and Winthrop.

226
00:38:24,921 --> 00:38:28,622
[SPEAKER_15]: It's very, the stairs that are there, it's a great photo op area.

227
00:38:29,402 --> 00:38:32,984
[SPEAKER_15]: However, to get to that area right now, you have to traverse those stairs.

228
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:34,824
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's not ADA compliant.

229
00:38:35,404 --> 00:38:39,126
[SPEAKER_15]: So last year, CPA funded a design study for

230
00:38:40,226 --> 00:38:49,173
[SPEAKER_15]: inputting a historic, it's in the historic section again, access road that would bring people right to the backside of the memorial.

231
00:38:49,674 --> 00:38:53,076
[SPEAKER_15]: This would add ADA parking to that design.

232
00:38:53,156 --> 00:38:58,020
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's just kind of an augmentation to a previous award that was done.

233
00:38:58,701 --> 00:39:00,762
[SPEAKER_15]: So again, right now that area is accessed

234
00:39:01,885 --> 00:39:04,527
[SPEAKER_15]: by, you know, pedestrian traffic.

235
00:39:04,607 --> 00:39:11,233
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's no way for somebody who is bound to a vehicle who has mobility challenges to get up to this area.

236
00:39:12,074 --> 00:39:18,599
[SPEAKER_15]: So this would, for $35,000, would add to the existing design to add ADA parking.

237
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,842
[SPEAKER_15]: Happy to address any questions from the council.

238
00:39:22,162 --> 00:39:22,442
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

239
00:39:23,123 --> 00:39:26,686
[SPEAKER_08]: And thank you Stacey and Dee for being here and for your service on our cemetery trustees.

240
00:39:26,706 --> 00:39:29,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we have any questions on this project?

241
00:39:32,437 --> 00:39:37,182
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none, it's a beautiful statue of victory if I'm right up there.

242
00:39:37,222 --> 00:39:39,163
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think it'd be great for more people to be able to see it.

243
00:39:39,504 --> 00:39:42,526
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

244
00:39:42,667 --> 00:39:43,127
[SPEAKER_08]: Fantastic.

245
00:39:43,327 --> 00:39:45,950
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks you guys for coming down to City Hall on this cold night.

246
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:48,352
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

247
00:39:50,033 --> 00:39:54,115
[SPEAKER_15]: Next up, we're cruising right along, the Brooks Estate Archaeological Survey.

248
00:39:54,515 --> 00:40:04,600
[SPEAKER_15]: This actually came to us as a small grant in partnership with the Medford Historical Commission and the Medford Brooks Estate Land Trust, which is known as MBELT.

249
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:10,643
[SPEAKER_15]: I am joined on Zoom by Ryan Hayward, who is the Vice Chair of the Historical Commission.

250
00:40:11,583 --> 00:40:16,245
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just want to recognize him if he wants to chime in with any additional comments here.

251
00:40:16,305 --> 00:40:28,251
[SPEAKER_15]: But this would, the Brooks Estate is, some folks may not know it, but it is a lovely parcel of land that's all under conservation restriction that's off of Grove Street.

252
00:40:28,271 --> 00:40:32,073
[SPEAKER_15]: It's right on the Winchester and Medford line, but this is the ancestral home

253
00:40:32,873 --> 00:40:35,574
[SPEAKER_15]: of the Brooks family who helped establish Medford here.

254
00:40:35,914 --> 00:40:43,216
[SPEAKER_15]: This archaeological survey is a desktop survey that would do some historical research into the area.

255
00:40:43,256 --> 00:40:45,237
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not actually somebody going out there and digging.

256
00:40:45,257 --> 00:40:52,839
[SPEAKER_15]: This is step one before the digging, which of course will be very fun to ascertain what type of historical significance

257
00:40:54,039 --> 00:40:55,160
[SPEAKER_15]: there might be in that area.

258
00:40:55,980 --> 00:41:03,305
[SPEAKER_15]: We're working on, for instance, Thomas Brooks Park right now, which we know was the original homestead for the Brooks family before they built the manor.

259
00:41:04,385 --> 00:41:08,788
[SPEAKER_15]: And we just went through an archaeological study there and found all kinds of interesting things, including

260
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:16,939
[SPEAKER_15]: pottery and glass and just ways of, you know, things that were just normal everyday lives of folks in the 18th century.

261
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:27,091
[SPEAKER_15]: So this would just be a small grant to undergo a study to help kind of identify and preserve those cultural artifacts that may be in the soil.

262
00:41:27,732 --> 00:41:30,335
[SPEAKER_15]: So this is step one before the actual archaeological.

263
00:41:31,313 --> 00:41:33,774
[SPEAKER_08]: And sorry if you mentioned it, but there's matching funds here as well.

264
00:41:34,014 --> 00:41:35,214
[SPEAKER_15]: There are matching funds.

265
00:41:35,694 --> 00:41:39,936
[SPEAKER_15]: I will publicly say Ryan Hayward is great at hustling to find grant money.

266
00:41:40,476 --> 00:41:48,059
[SPEAKER_15]: He found some grant money from Freedom's Way, which is a local heritage program that funds historical projects.

267
00:41:49,219 --> 00:41:59,482
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a very finite area, but the path I'm drawing a blank on right now, but Medford is one of the eligible communities for the Freedom's Way grant.

268
00:41:59,502 --> 00:42:00,683
[SPEAKER_15]: So there is some match money here.

269
00:42:01,483 --> 00:42:09,469
[SPEAKER_15]: as well as a little bit, I believe, from their operating budget to get to the $15,000 for that project.

270
00:42:09,549 --> 00:42:10,970
[SPEAKER_15]: We're funding 10,000 of it.

271
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:12,051
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

272
00:42:12,631 --> 00:42:16,714
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we have any questions for Teresa or Ryan about this project?

273
00:42:20,457 --> 00:42:22,198
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none, we can move to the next one.

274
00:42:24,892 --> 00:42:26,975
[SPEAKER_15]: We're sticking at the Brooks Estate.

275
00:42:27,195 --> 00:42:29,658
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, Brooks Estate is home to the Shepard's Brooks Manor.

276
00:42:30,358 --> 00:42:41,190
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a wonderful property that the Brooks Estate Land Trust has been diligently working on for years to bring it up to standard so that it can be used for actual

277
00:42:41,951 --> 00:42:44,292
[SPEAKER_15]: event space and community gathering.

278
00:42:44,392 --> 00:42:48,893
[SPEAKER_15]: So this project is the Brooks Estate ADA parking and pathways.

279
00:42:49,393 --> 00:42:56,556
[SPEAKER_15]: Currently right now, if you have visited the Brooks Estate, you can walk up an unpaved path to get up to the Brooks Estate.

280
00:42:56,576 --> 00:43:00,577
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a lovely walk, but then right immediately in front of the manor,

281
00:43:00,937 --> 00:43:01,997
[SPEAKER_15]: There is no parking there.

282
00:43:02,657 --> 00:43:05,098
[SPEAKER_15]: So this would formalize a parking lot area.

283
00:43:05,858 --> 00:43:09,499
[SPEAKER_15]: CPA dollars are eligible to fund the ADA aspects of this.

284
00:43:09,579 --> 00:43:16,840
[SPEAKER_15]: So it would pay for the implementation of parking spots as well as pathways that lead up to the manor space.

285
00:43:17,621 --> 00:43:22,622
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, with the future intention of creating an event space, a public event space up there.

286
00:43:25,242 --> 00:43:29,043
[SPEAKER_15]: So it is a hefty price tag because construction of parking lots is

287
00:43:29,513 --> 00:43:32,214
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a great business to be in if anybody's looking for a new career.

288
00:43:33,114 --> 00:43:36,656
[SPEAKER_15]: It's $602,000 to fund this portion of the project.

289
00:43:37,716 --> 00:43:39,997
[SPEAKER_15]: And the Brooks Estate is always looking for fundraising.

290
00:43:40,057 --> 00:43:46,979
[SPEAKER_15]: If there's anybody out there that would like to continue to donate to their projects, they are still seeking additional funds for all the various.

291
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:49,160
[SPEAKER_15]: There's not a shortage of projects up at the Brooks Estate.

292
00:43:49,675 --> 00:43:51,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and I can just chime in a little bit.

293
00:43:51,856 --> 00:43:53,637
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm on the M-Belt board.

294
00:43:53,657 --> 00:43:58,059
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm the city council representative to M-Belt and have been for the past six years.

295
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:06,903
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, I really think M-Belt is one of our hidden gems and also has been underinvested in for a very long time.

296
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:13,047
[SPEAKER_08]: And the CPA and the CPC's support for M-Belt has really been transformative.

297
00:44:15,349 --> 00:44:25,246
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's a 50-acre, beautiful land trust for conservation and historical preservation of some really beautiful structures.

298
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:42,526
[SPEAKER_08]: really changes the ability of people to access especially the manor and hopefully eventually in the future the carriage house whether that's for events or meetings or just going up there to explore the trails and it's a really huge investment.

299
00:44:43,147 --> 00:44:48,133
[SPEAKER_08]: There are other funds from the state and from some lovely

300
00:44:48,832 --> 00:44:54,954
[SPEAKER_08]: private donors, small-dollar donors, I will say, and our M-BELT members that are also going into this project.

301
00:44:55,694 --> 00:45:05,558
[SPEAKER_08]: That is a really important foundation for the long-term plans for the Brooks Estate to be a place where people can really go and access and celebrate

302
00:45:06,858 --> 00:45:14,102
[SPEAKER_08]: this open space and conservation land that we are very lucky was not many decades ago turned into a golf course.

303
00:45:14,403 --> 00:45:22,408
[SPEAKER_08]: So that is a beautiful thing, and it's right behind Oak Grove Cemetery, if you weren't aware.

304
00:45:22,548 --> 00:45:28,851
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think the improvements for the Brooks Estate as well as for our cemetery are hand-in-hand there as well.

305
00:45:32,234 --> 00:45:34,435
[SPEAKER_08]: Any questions for Teresa on this project?

306
00:45:40,301 --> 00:45:41,885
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, seeing none, we'll go to the next.

307
00:45:42,967 --> 00:45:44,050
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, next one.

308
00:45:44,391 --> 00:45:49,142
[SPEAKER_15]: We are at the Cross Street Cemetery Monument restoration phase two.

309
00:45:50,283 --> 00:46:05,751
[SPEAKER_15]: So phase one involved a pilot of cleaning some monuments or headstones, the industry term is monument, but headstones that are up at the new Cross Street Cemetery, which is located within Oak Grove Cemetery.

310
00:46:05,791 --> 00:46:10,854
[SPEAKER_15]: This was the relocated cemetery from Medford Square that was relocated in the late 50s.

311
00:46:11,974 --> 00:46:18,298
[SPEAKER_15]: They had placed the monuments over there, relocated folks, but it has been,

312
00:46:20,217 --> 00:46:22,399
[SPEAKER_15]: a victim of some deferred maintenance over there.

313
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:25,682
[SPEAKER_15]: We are led by the Medford Historical Commission.

314
00:46:25,722 --> 00:46:36,713
[SPEAKER_15]: We are looking to do some treatment of the remaining headstones to get them up to snuff and to just really pay attention to this fairly important piece of Medford history.

315
00:46:36,733 --> 00:46:42,259
[SPEAKER_15]: A lot of the folks who built Medford were located in Cross Street Cemetery.

316
00:46:44,013 --> 00:46:45,814
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a good project to do.

317
00:46:46,414 --> 00:46:47,215
[SPEAKER_15]: It is in the amount of $126,500.

318
00:46:47,275 --> 00:46:54,419
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, this would be a treatment for the 400 plus monuments that are up there.

319
00:46:55,579 --> 00:47:03,664
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, this is a project by the Historical Commission, so I will invite Ryan Hayward to share anything additional that he may like to share.

320
00:47:04,584 --> 00:47:07,426
[SPEAKER_15]: If there's any questions from the council, I'd be happy to address them.

321
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:11,801
[SPEAKER_08]: Ryan, if you want to raise your hand, if you want to say anything.

322
00:47:11,821 --> 00:47:13,742
[SPEAKER_08]: Are there any questions from the council?

323
00:47:19,624 --> 00:47:20,605
[SPEAKER_08]: Liz has one.

324
00:47:20,665 --> 00:47:21,225
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Mullane.

325
00:47:22,566 --> 00:47:23,866
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for putting this together.

326
00:47:23,886 --> 00:47:26,947
[SPEAKER_09]: So trees, in phase 2, I know phase 1 was 10.

327
00:47:27,288 --> 00:47:29,388
[SPEAKER_09]: So how many remaining ones do you have left to do?

328
00:47:29,408 --> 00:47:31,950
[SPEAKER_09]: How much will this cover and will there be more remaining?

329
00:47:31,970 --> 00:47:32,930
[SPEAKER_09]: How does that look?

330
00:47:33,282 --> 00:47:42,336
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep, I want to, don't quote me on the numbers, that's why if Ryan can hear me and correct me, I believe it's around 370 monuments that are remaining up there to be cleaned.

331
00:47:43,457 --> 00:47:45,020
[SPEAKER_08]: I've unmuted Ryan if you want.

332
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:45,220
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

333
00:47:46,482 --> 00:47:48,385
[SPEAKER_15]: Ryan, feel free to chime in here if you'd like.

334
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:53,221
[SPEAKER_11]: The project is for 85 additional monuments.

335
00:47:53,241 --> 00:47:56,182
[SPEAKER_11]: There's 471 monuments in total in the cemetery.

336
00:47:56,202 --> 00:48:06,485
[SPEAKER_11]: 85 remain, some level of restoration, and the remaining ones just need to be all cleaned, which can be done by volunteers.

337
00:48:08,206 --> 00:48:15,869
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, which I've been trying to plug that as often as I can, that they would be looking for volunteers to help with the remaining treatment.

338
00:48:15,889 --> 00:48:16,509
[SPEAKER_15]: So if anybody

339
00:48:17,694 --> 00:48:22,496
[SPEAKER_15]: wants to hang out in a cemetery and have a very interesting story to tell at your next dinner party.

340
00:48:23,656 --> 00:48:27,438
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sure they'll be looking for volunteers in a few months here.

341
00:48:29,019 --> 00:48:29,319
[SPEAKER_15]: Of course.

342
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:30,119
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

343
00:48:30,399 --> 00:48:31,920
[SPEAKER_08]: Any more questions on this project?

344
00:48:36,322 --> 00:48:39,523
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none, we can move on to our housing families.

345
00:48:41,735 --> 00:48:46,117
[SPEAKER_15]: And I do see Jana Stafford from Housing Families is online.

346
00:48:46,177 --> 00:48:50,038
[SPEAKER_15]: But next we are shifting gears and looking at our housing programs.

347
00:48:50,638 --> 00:49:00,181
[SPEAKER_15]: So this is the Housing Families, it's, it's I believe the acronym is Legal Aid and Well-Being Stability Laws Program, but this is our Homelessness Prevention Program.

348
00:49:00,721 --> 00:49:04,943
[SPEAKER_15]: It's an ongoing program that was introduced in 2020 and is still going very strong.

349
00:49:05,423 --> 00:49:07,204
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a good partnership with housing families.

350
00:49:07,284 --> 00:49:16,329
[SPEAKER_15]: What they do is they provide eviction mitigation services, legal services, as well as helping with back-due rent, or what's called rental arrears.

351
00:49:17,389 --> 00:49:19,590
[SPEAKER_15]: They are located locally in Malden.

352
00:49:19,610 --> 00:49:25,733
[SPEAKER_15]: They do support multiple municipalities, but we've never felt like Medford is second to anybody else.

353
00:49:25,793 --> 00:49:28,655
[SPEAKER_15]: Jana's always been great and there for any questions.

354
00:49:29,295 --> 00:49:33,197
[SPEAKER_15]: We have great communication, no complaints about the program on our end.

355
00:49:33,757 --> 00:49:42,101
[SPEAKER_15]: I do want to invite Jaina to share some words if she feels... Sorry, I'm just seeing... It never fails.

356
00:49:42,541 --> 00:49:43,161
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

357
00:49:44,542 --> 00:49:45,442
[SPEAKER_16]: He wants to be a star.

358
00:49:46,383 --> 00:49:48,524
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you all so much for having me here.

359
00:49:48,544 --> 00:49:51,765
[SPEAKER_16]: Jaina Stafford, he's been sitting quietly this whole time.

360
00:49:54,701 --> 00:49:56,682
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm the director of the last program.

361
00:49:57,042 --> 00:50:02,304
[SPEAKER_16]: We renamed it from Homelessness Prevention and Legal Services to make it a little shorter and easier to say.

362
00:50:02,824 --> 00:50:05,426
[SPEAKER_16]: So now Legal Aid for Wellbeing and Stability.

363
00:50:05,446 --> 00:50:11,848
[SPEAKER_16]: As Teresa said, we work along the whole homelessness prevention continuum.

364
00:50:11,908 --> 00:50:22,773
[SPEAKER_16]: So going very far up to when someone has a question about their landlord preparing to sell the property, all the way through the constables at my door with an execution, what do I do?

365
00:50:23,373 --> 00:50:33,137
[SPEAKER_16]: And we blend our legal services with our homelessness prevention and also supply rental assistance when it makes sense in that situation.

366
00:50:34,178 --> 00:50:45,022
[SPEAKER_16]: So this program will be, this would be our fourth round, application for a fourth round of funds for Medford residents.

367
00:50:48,704 --> 00:50:48,924
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

368
00:50:49,144 --> 00:50:50,625
[SPEAKER_08]: I will go to Vice President Lazzaro.

369
00:50:52,822 --> 00:50:54,744
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to say thank you to housing families.

370
00:50:54,784 --> 00:50:55,864
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for including this.

371
00:50:55,965 --> 00:51:03,090
[SPEAKER_14]: Is this the same dollar amount as we've applied for the past two years or that housing families has applied for?

372
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:06,913
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's slightly more.

373
00:51:06,933 --> 00:51:11,217
[SPEAKER_16]: I think our last grant was 69,000 and this is 75,000.

374
00:51:11,297 --> 00:51:14,019
[SPEAKER_16]: Teresa, please tell me if I have that mixed up.

375
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:16,080
[SPEAKER_15]: You're absolutely correct.

376
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:19,163
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe year three was 60, then 69,000 last year, now 75.

377
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:30,971
[SPEAKER_14]: Have we been seeing an increase in need, or is it inflation, or is there another reason for the increase?

378
00:51:32,253 --> 00:51:34,476
[SPEAKER_16]: There has been so much need.

379
00:51:34,996 --> 00:51:39,002
[SPEAKER_16]: As we know, housing has been a problem and a need for such a long time.

380
00:51:39,499 --> 00:51:44,082
[SPEAKER_16]: But during the pandemic, it has really increased quite a lot.

381
00:51:44,402 --> 00:51:51,866
[SPEAKER_16]: Prior to the pandemic, we were administering about $20,000 a year in rental assistance funds, so a very small amount.

382
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:56,329
[SPEAKER_16]: And since in these last five years, our team has administered $875,000.

383
00:51:56,369 --> 00:51:59,351
[SPEAKER_16]: So we've just seen the need continue to expand from year to year.

384
00:52:05,746 --> 00:52:11,908
[SPEAKER_16]: I've been doing this since 2006, and I've seen the rents just explode all over our area.

385
00:52:12,008 --> 00:52:15,849
[SPEAKER_16]: So if somebody would get behind before, we might be able to cobble some funds together.

386
00:52:15,909 --> 00:52:21,091
[SPEAKER_16]: But now they get behind, it's $2,500 a month, it's $30,000 a year.

387
00:52:21,131 --> 00:52:25,232
[SPEAKER_16]: It just adds up so quickly with the high cost of rentals.

388
00:52:25,252 --> 00:52:27,353
[SPEAKER_14]: I understand.

389
00:52:28,173 --> 00:52:34,715
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you so much for including this in the presentation and for the work that you do.

390
00:52:35,072 --> 00:52:35,772
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate it a lot.

391
00:52:36,373 --> 00:52:37,113
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you so much.

392
00:52:37,173 --> 00:52:38,054
[SPEAKER_16]: I appreciate that.

393
00:52:39,615 --> 00:52:40,975
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Leming.

394
00:52:46,238 --> 00:52:50,261
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I had literally the exact same question as Council Vice President Lazzaro.

395
00:52:51,121 --> 00:52:51,341
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

396
00:52:52,302 --> 00:52:55,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Any more questions for Jayna or Theresa on this project?

397
00:52:57,725 --> 00:52:58,525
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none.

398
00:52:59,086 --> 00:53:00,546
[SPEAKER_08]: Affordable Housing Trust.

399
00:53:01,447 --> 00:53:02,027
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Jayna.

400
00:53:02,748 --> 00:53:03,228
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you all.

401
00:53:05,038 --> 00:53:19,083
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, next up we have the Medford Affordable Housing Trust, and I am joined in the chambers by Chairperson Lisa Davidson of the Affordable Housing Trust, as well as our staff member, housing planner, Catherine Buckingham, who is staff support to the trust.

402
00:53:20,455 --> 00:53:30,680
[SPEAKER_15]: We are here tonight asking for your, recommending the amount of 550,000 of the CPA budget to fund the tranche.

403
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:35,842
[SPEAKER_15]: It's an annual tranche to fund the trust on their ongoing efforts in affordable housing.

404
00:53:37,083 --> 00:53:47,308
[SPEAKER_15]: I will allow them to speak to anything that they may want to add here, but this is, it's a best practice in a lot of other municipalities to assign a large amount of your CPA funds

405
00:53:47,748 --> 00:53:49,972
[SPEAKER_15]: to your local housing trust if you have one.

406
00:53:50,353 --> 00:53:52,216
[SPEAKER_15]: We are lucky enough to have one here in Medford.

407
00:53:53,318 --> 00:54:00,071
[SPEAKER_15]: So we are just trying to provide sustainable, consistent, reliable funding because right now they are still

408
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:03,990
[SPEAKER_15]: fact-finding on various ways to fund the trust.

409
00:54:04,510 --> 00:54:19,463
[SPEAKER_15]: There are ways through linkage, developer fees, and, you know, just other type of grants that are out there, but largely the CPA is providing that consistent funding for them so that they can bank on that year over year.

410
00:54:19,803 --> 00:54:25,167
[SPEAKER_15]: So as of right now, the CPC has elected to, off the top,

411
00:54:26,108 --> 00:54:30,301
[SPEAKER_15]: fund 25% of our annual budget to the Affordable Housing Trust.

412
00:54:30,903 --> 00:54:32,247
[SPEAKER_15]: I also note that this gives us

413
00:54:34,151 --> 00:54:43,115
[SPEAKER_15]: status as a, the word escapes me at this moment, but it does give us housing choice.

414
00:54:43,135 --> 00:54:44,336
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much, appreciate you.

415
00:54:45,296 --> 00:54:56,202
[SPEAKER_15]: It gives us a housing choice designation from the EOHLC, which just allows Medford, it gives us, puts us in a special bucket of municipalities that

416
00:54:56,882 --> 00:55:15,569
[SPEAKER_15]: commit to affordable housing through the metric of can you if you devote 25 at least 25 percent of your CPA budget to housing that makes us a housing choice designated community and opens us up for additional grant opportunities that are exclusive to those housing choice communities.

417
00:55:16,329 --> 00:55:26,433
[SPEAKER_15]: So looking at that looking at best practices looking at the needs of the trust the CPC has elected to fund 25 percent of the budget annually going forward towards the trust.

418
00:55:28,155 --> 00:55:28,475
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

419
00:55:28,555 --> 00:55:29,116
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Leming.

420
00:55:31,137 --> 00:55:33,599
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd just like to say I like this line item.

421
00:55:33,639 --> 00:55:36,681
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad that the CPA is doing this.

422
00:55:36,761 --> 00:55:45,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Back when I served on the CPA, we ran into the problem of any significant affordable housing project only coming along once every few years.

423
00:55:45,106 --> 00:55:51,250
[SPEAKER_06]: And just for the public's awareness, CPA funding has to be spent in full every year.

424
00:55:52,411 --> 00:56:00,196
[SPEAKER_06]: when we were trying to find out how to fund the, put forward our share of the funding for Walkling Court.

425
00:56:00,617 --> 00:56:08,142
[SPEAKER_06]: That would have taken about three years of CPA funding to put forth just about 2% of that.

426
00:56:08,222 --> 00:56:14,446
[SPEAKER_06]: So one of the benefits of the Affordable Housing Trust is that you don't have to spend all of it every year.

427
00:56:14,486 --> 00:56:16,647
[SPEAKER_06]: You can sort of build it up over time.

428
00:56:16,707 --> 00:56:19,809
[SPEAKER_06]: So putting a significant amount of,

429
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:27,554
[SPEAKER_06]: funding from the CPA every year into the Affordable Housing Trust is generally seen as best practice.

430
00:56:27,594 --> 00:56:32,578
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm just wanted to offer my support saying I'm glad we're doing this.

431
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:35,339
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Leming.

432
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:39,282
[SPEAKER_08]: Any further questions from the Council on this appropriation?

433
00:56:42,584 --> 00:56:45,906
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none, we'll move to our next project.

434
00:56:46,046 --> 00:56:47,747
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we're skipping Placehead Park.

435
00:56:47,807 --> 00:56:48,248
[SPEAKER_08]: We have

436
00:56:49,496 --> 00:56:52,041
[SPEAKER_08]: The Shiloh Baptist Church window restoration phase two.

437
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:53,824
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me unmute you, Teresa.

438
00:56:53,844 --> 00:56:56,970
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead.

439
00:56:58,355 --> 00:57:08,119
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, I am joined on Zoom by, I'd like to recognize Mr. Bill McIntyre as well as Mr. Cliff Singleton who have been the project managers at Shiloh Baptist Church's restoration.

440
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:15,823
[SPEAKER_15]: They have come to the CPC seeking $150,000 to continue their window restoration project.

441
00:57:16,203 --> 00:57:27,748
[SPEAKER_15]: They kind of put a pause on that one whenever they were blessed with finding a tenant and they pivoted their restoration of the building to building out ADA access and their basement space to accommodate this tenant.

442
00:57:28,368 --> 00:57:36,878
[SPEAKER_15]: Now that that is well underway and nearing the finish line, we can almost see it, we are now pivoting back to focusing on the windows.

443
00:57:37,338 --> 00:57:41,463
[SPEAKER_15]: These are historic stained glass windows that are very unique to the building.

444
00:57:41,503 --> 00:57:44,887
[SPEAKER_15]: If you look at the outside of the building, almost every single window is stained glass.

445
00:57:45,868 --> 00:57:48,889
[SPEAKER_15]: It provides a wonderful historic aesthetic to the neighborhood.

446
00:57:49,469 --> 00:57:51,270
[SPEAKER_15]: These windows are in dire need of repair.

447
00:57:51,370 --> 00:57:56,431
[SPEAKER_15]: Some of them are missing complete panels and wind is coming through and there's a lot of weather inundation.

448
00:57:57,191 --> 00:58:02,033
[SPEAKER_15]: So this $150,000 would be used towards prioritizing some of their windows.

449
00:58:03,773 --> 00:58:04,874
[SPEAKER_15]: They do need more than $150,000.

450
00:58:05,374 --> 00:58:12,796
[SPEAKER_15]: So again, another organization that is always looking for hearty donations if anybody feels so inclined, but this would

451
00:58:13,236 --> 00:58:15,397
[SPEAKER_15]: kickstart the window restoration efforts.

452
00:58:16,318 --> 00:58:23,982
[SPEAKER_15]: And I don't want to, again, steal thunder from Bill or Cliff, but I want to recognize them if they have anything else that they would like to add.

453
00:58:24,862 --> 00:58:26,623
[SPEAKER_15]: And if there's any questions from the council.

454
00:58:27,164 --> 00:58:27,644
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

455
00:58:27,984 --> 00:58:34,047
[SPEAKER_08]: I will, if you want to raise your hands, Bill or Cliff, and I can recognize you if you want to add to what Teresa said.

456
00:58:34,248 --> 00:58:34,848
[SPEAKER_08]: You got it, Bill.

457
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:41,572
[SPEAKER_08]: Bill, you may have to click a button to unmute yourself.

458
00:58:45,838 --> 00:58:46,258
[SPEAKER_01]: we go.

459
00:58:47,359 --> 00:59:07,568
[SPEAKER_01]: We certainly appreciated the effort of CPA to make sure that we have great access to for the community and our own services in this access program that's coming to a good end I believe and that we're ready to make sure that the building itself is conserved.

460
00:59:08,128 --> 00:59:15,332
[SPEAKER_01]: These windows that we have been looking at for years and years have been examined or evaluated by architect and

461
00:59:16,062 --> 00:59:17,983
[SPEAKER_01]: independent parties.

462
00:59:18,663 --> 00:59:34,532
[SPEAKER_01]: But we want to probably take a look at the Palladium window that's on one Holton and the other Palladium on Bower Street and conserve those because those are more sensitive to weather and also conserving energy.

463
00:59:34,932 --> 00:59:37,954
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are looking at that as a strong evaluation.

464
00:59:37,994 --> 00:59:45,138
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had some small donors who the last time we did this round, they

465
00:59:45,806 --> 00:59:54,894
[SPEAKER_01]: put the money on our escrow fund so we have not much dollars, but we have dollars from people who are in the community who wanted to see this happen.

466
00:59:55,474 --> 01:00:06,724
[SPEAKER_01]: So we certainly appreciate your effort there to fund this program and to make sure that it looks great for the community and it improves the property values there.

467
01:00:10,487 --> 01:00:10,887
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Bill.

468
01:00:13,363 --> 01:00:15,371
[SPEAKER_08]: Cliff, anything you want to add, Cliff?

469
01:00:15,471 --> 01:00:16,595
[SPEAKER_08]: Or I'll go back to Teresa first.

470
01:00:17,002 --> 01:00:21,103
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, I just also want to add that I was remiss and I didn't mention this.

471
01:00:22,283 --> 01:00:31,185
[SPEAKER_15]: We have also partnered, I've partnered Shiloh Baptist with our economic development and our climate planner to see if there are any mass save programs that are out there.

472
01:00:31,605 --> 01:00:40,847
[SPEAKER_15]: Mass save does provide some financial benefit to commercial entities that make energy improvements and this may qualify as such.

473
01:00:40,927 --> 01:00:46,268
[SPEAKER_15]: So just want to point out that we're trying to find all funding opportunities for this project.

474
01:00:47,368 --> 01:00:52,812
[SPEAKER_15]: And just plugging that program for anybody else who's listening right now who may benefit from the program as well.

475
01:00:55,274 --> 01:00:55,594
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

476
01:00:57,416 --> 01:00:59,177
[SPEAKER_08]: Any questions on this project?

477
01:01:03,781 --> 01:01:05,061
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none, thank you both.

478
01:01:05,262 --> 01:01:08,304
[SPEAKER_08]: And we'll move to our next item on the list.

479
01:01:08,744 --> 01:01:09,905
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

480
01:01:11,006 --> 01:01:11,546
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Bill.

481
01:01:11,847 --> 01:01:12,307
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Cliff.

482
01:01:13,677 --> 01:01:16,278
[SPEAKER_15]: This will actually be our final project to review this evening.

483
01:01:17,078 --> 01:01:20,079
[SPEAKER_15]: This is the World War II fountain at Oak Grove Cemetery.

484
01:01:20,099 --> 01:01:21,840
[SPEAKER_15]: A lot of good stuff happening up at Oak Grove.

485
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:24,521
[SPEAKER_15]: We're doing a lot of things up there, which is excellent.

486
01:01:25,741 --> 01:01:41,747
[SPEAKER_15]: As you enter Oak Grove at the main entrance off of Playstead, you may have noticed that there has been this lovely viewing and gazing fountain at the World War II memorial, but you've probably never seen the fountain actually in operation, and that's because it hasn't been in operation for well over

487
01:01:42,564 --> 01:01:44,606
[SPEAKER_15]: We actually don't know, but at least 40 years.

488
01:01:45,527 --> 01:01:57,156
[SPEAKER_15]: So this project in the amount of $167,800 would restore the fountain as well as, you know, do some underground utility work to actually get it functional.

489
01:01:57,737 --> 01:02:08,506
[SPEAKER_15]: I do want to recognize Veronica Shaw, the Director of Veterans Affairs is online and recognize her if she wants to add anything here, but yeah, I think it's a good project.

490
01:02:11,612 --> 01:02:13,343
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, thanks Teresa Veronica.

491
01:02:13,564 --> 01:02:15,114
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll unmute you if you want to add anything.

492
01:02:18,582 --> 01:02:19,702
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, good evening everybody.

493
01:02:19,722 --> 01:02:29,285
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to thank the board for approving us so far, and I'm so excited that the angel will actually be working.

494
01:02:29,305 --> 01:02:33,406
[SPEAKER_13]: It would be awesome if we could have her fully functional by Memorial Day.

495
01:02:33,426 --> 01:02:44,089
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that's sort of the really, really ambitious timeline that we have talked about, but I'm so excited to have her up and functioning for all of Medford's veterans.

496
01:02:46,430 --> 01:02:47,190
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Director Shaw.

497
01:02:48,326 --> 01:02:58,433
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd also like just to point out, just because so much research has been done into the various sculptures, that World War I, the memorial over on the stairs that CPA did fund to restore,

498
01:03:03,033 --> 01:03:05,234
[SPEAKER_15]: and look out for a rededication ceremony.

499
01:03:05,274 --> 01:03:07,414
[SPEAKER_15]: We're really excited to share that work there.

500
01:03:08,174 --> 01:03:12,635
[SPEAKER_15]: It was the same sculptor who did the World War I memorial as did the statue here.

501
01:03:12,675 --> 01:03:13,855
[SPEAKER_15]: That's Emilius Ciampa.

502
01:03:15,256 --> 01:03:20,517
[SPEAKER_15]: There's so much of his artwork that is still around today, so it really should be celebrated.

503
01:03:20,857 --> 01:03:22,177
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to plug that.

504
01:03:22,717 --> 01:03:25,118
[SPEAKER_15]: D. Morris has been doing an excellent job of

505
01:03:26,432 --> 01:03:33,955
[SPEAKER_15]: of doing the research on our various aesthetic elements around the city just to make sure that we're aware of their historical value.

506
01:03:37,536 --> 01:03:37,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

507
01:03:38,777 --> 01:03:40,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Any questions on this project?

508
01:03:41,658 --> 01:03:42,258
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Leming.

509
01:03:43,922 --> 01:03:50,888
[SPEAKER_06]: No question, just wanted to say thank you so much Veronica and Teresa for all your work on this.

510
01:03:50,988 --> 01:03:57,313
[SPEAKER_06]: And I look forward to the rededication ceremony and seeing the fountain operational.

511
01:03:58,915 --> 01:04:00,076
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilwoman.

512
01:04:01,257 --> 01:04:01,817
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.

513
01:04:01,837 --> 01:04:05,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Fantastic.

514
01:04:05,941 --> 01:04:06,201
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

515
01:04:06,421 --> 01:04:08,003
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's all of our projects.

516
01:04:09,164 --> 01:04:10,645
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Lazzaro has her hand up.

517
01:04:10,665 --> 01:04:11,746
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, sorry, Vice President Lazzaro.

518
01:04:14,385 --> 01:04:14,705
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

519
01:04:14,745 --> 01:04:20,907
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wanted to say thank you to Teresa for this beautiful presentation, really comprehensive.

520
01:04:20,987 --> 01:04:26,308
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just also thought that the presentation graphics were really nice, too.

521
01:04:26,608 --> 01:04:29,049
[SPEAKER_14]: And I wanted to say great work.

522
01:04:29,569 --> 01:04:30,709
[SPEAKER_14]: And I really appreciate it.

523
01:04:32,490 --> 01:04:32,870
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

524
01:04:32,890 --> 01:04:33,750
[SPEAKER_15]: I appreciate that.

525
01:04:34,991 --> 01:04:35,931
[SPEAKER_15]: Trying to make things prettier.

526
01:04:36,291 --> 01:04:37,251
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Vice President Zara.

527
01:04:37,271 --> 01:04:39,392
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and this was really easy to read and understand.

528
01:04:39,432 --> 01:04:42,573
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's really important in the materials we're putting out.

529
01:04:44,122 --> 01:04:49,025
[SPEAKER_08]: I even have a color copy here, which is magic in this building sometimes.

530
01:04:49,786 --> 01:04:50,986
[SPEAKER_15]: We do what we can when we can.

531
01:04:51,187 --> 01:04:52,047
[SPEAKER_08]: I can read the charts.

532
01:04:54,849 --> 01:04:59,192
[SPEAKER_08]: I do want to talk a little bit about just the general funding of the program.

533
01:04:59,232 --> 01:05:05,296
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks like we're doing a lot of open space and recreation this year, and then affordable housing, and then historic preservation.

534
01:05:05,556 --> 01:05:09,438
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about

535
01:05:11,641 --> 01:05:16,805
[SPEAKER_08]: what the conditions are for that and where we will be going, you know, in the future.

536
01:05:16,845 --> 01:05:20,508
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, these distributions change, and I just was wondering if you could talk a little bit about that.

537
01:05:20,888 --> 01:05:21,489
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, of course.

538
01:05:21,529 --> 01:05:24,791
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, every year we get a whole new wave of applications.

539
01:05:24,831 --> 01:05:29,695
[SPEAKER_15]: Sometimes we might see one that fell through and they just couldn't get it together for the first fiscal year.

540
01:05:29,735 --> 01:05:30,415
[SPEAKER_15]: They needed some more.

541
01:05:30,896 --> 01:05:31,816
[SPEAKER_15]: So we might see them over.

542
01:05:31,856 --> 01:05:35,659
[SPEAKER_15]: But largely, every year it's a whole fresh slate of projects.

543
01:05:35,739 --> 01:05:37,701
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's hard for us to always predict

544
01:05:38,361 --> 01:05:40,342
[SPEAKER_15]: are we going to see more park projects?

545
01:05:40,703 --> 01:05:48,828
[SPEAKER_15]: During the pandemic, I will say when we had ARPA funding, we saw a little bit more park projects because we did have more match funds available to make small improvements.

546
01:05:49,929 --> 01:05:51,870
[SPEAKER_15]: But really, it's a luck of the draw.

547
01:05:51,910 --> 01:06:02,196
[SPEAKER_15]: This year, there's quite a bit in open space and recreation because we had two very large, those are two projects largely right there between Tufts and Brooks Estate.

548
01:06:05,328 --> 01:06:09,170
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I can't really speak to like is this a trend that we're seeing?

549
01:06:09,350 --> 01:06:13,151
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I mean there's always going to be more housing needs than we have available funding for.

550
01:06:13,191 --> 01:06:16,172
[SPEAKER_15]: There will always be more historic preservation needs than we have funding for.

551
01:06:17,233 --> 01:06:28,958
[SPEAKER_15]: So we are held to, just so everybody is aware, a minimum of spending 10% or budgeting or reserving 10% of our annual budget to each of those three buckets, historic preservation,

552
01:06:29,718 --> 01:06:31,621
[SPEAKER_15]: affordable housing, as well as open space.

553
01:06:31,641 --> 01:06:36,527
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're held to reserving or spending 10% of our annual budget in each of those buckets.

554
01:06:37,147 --> 01:06:38,810
[SPEAKER_15]: That remaining 65% can get dispersed however we see.

555
01:06:44,683 --> 01:06:46,444
[SPEAKER_15]: We vetted the applications.

556
01:06:46,484 --> 01:06:48,365
[SPEAKER_15]: There is a very rigorous review project.

557
01:06:48,386 --> 01:06:58,672
[SPEAKER_15]: This was over the course of two meetings of presentation and two meetings of deliberation, so a total of approximately 12 hours of just talking about these projects went into it.

558
01:06:59,433 --> 01:07:02,155
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a prioritization process that we look at.

559
01:07:02,175 --> 01:07:06,017
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, there's nine members on our committee, and those are all individual voices.

560
01:07:06,077 --> 01:07:09,900
[SPEAKER_15]: So when we're talking about priorities, you know, we have all these various different viewpoints here.

561
01:07:11,261 --> 01:07:14,962
[SPEAKER_15]: But we come to a consensus, and this is kind of where we landed for fiscal 26.

562
01:07:17,143 --> 01:07:18,524
[SPEAKER_15]: Next year, who knows?

563
01:07:19,444 --> 01:07:20,905
[SPEAKER_15]: It might be a more even split.

564
01:07:22,186 --> 01:07:27,788
[SPEAKER_15]: We might see something more heavier, but I hope that addressed your question, but happy to have any follow-up.

565
01:07:30,910 --> 01:07:31,130
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.

566
01:07:31,190 --> 01:07:32,471
[SPEAKER_08]: I just really appreciate going through that.

567
01:07:32,731 --> 01:07:38,794
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we have any more questions for Manager Dupont on the CPA recommendations?

568
01:07:42,643 --> 01:07:43,104
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Tseng.

569
01:07:45,265 --> 01:07:51,530
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to thank you and thank everyone who has worked so hard to put these applications together and to review them.

570
01:07:53,632 --> 01:07:59,196
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't have many questions tonight because I think these are all very important projects for our community.

571
01:08:00,537 --> 01:08:10,765
[SPEAKER_10]: I think individual Councilors have spoken to individual projects but I wanted to speak to these as a totality and to say on behalf of our community,

572
01:08:12,228 --> 01:08:16,732
[SPEAKER_10]: These are things that our residents feel in their everyday lives.

573
01:08:17,893 --> 01:08:20,034
[SPEAKER_10]: It changes how people experience their city.

574
01:08:20,975 --> 01:08:25,339
[SPEAKER_10]: And for that, I'm grateful for the hard work that you all have put into this.

575
01:08:25,979 --> 01:08:26,319
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

576
01:08:26,379 --> 01:08:28,261
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll make sure I bring that back to the CPC.

577
01:08:28,281 --> 01:08:31,764
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, this is the culmination of a year's worth of work.

578
01:08:31,944 --> 01:08:37,809
[SPEAKER_15]: So I appreciate your appreciation and your time and all public comments that we've received on these things.

579
01:08:38,369 --> 01:08:39,310
[SPEAKER_15]: We really appreciate it.

580
01:08:42,397 --> 01:08:42,757
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

581
01:08:44,098 --> 01:08:50,620
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing no further questions, is there a motion to refer these favorably to the regular council meeting for approval?

582
01:08:52,141 --> 01:09:06,846
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion of Councilor Tseng to refer the fiscal 26 recommendations for appropriation by the Community Preservation Committee to our regular meeting on February 3rd, seconded by Councilor Leming.

Excellent.

[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you all so much.

610
01:09:57,803 --> 01:09:59,163
