1
00:00:00,302 --> 00:00:01,602
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we can get started.

2
00:00:02,923 --> 00:00:03,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Do a quick roll call.

3
00:00:04,343 --> 00:00:07,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure we got everybody.

4
00:00:07,423 --> 00:00:09,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Here, we'll just start at the top.

5
00:00:09,684 --> 00:00:10,764
[SPEAKER_03]: Just let me know if you're here.

6
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:11,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Lois.

7
00:00:12,864 --> 00:00:13,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Here.

00:00:15,525 --> 00:00:16,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Recording in progress.

10
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:20,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

11
00:00:21,306 --> 00:00:21,946
[SPEAKER_03]: You got Benji?

12
00:00:26,487 --> 00:00:27,647
[SPEAKER_01]: You're muted, Benji.

13
00:00:33,443 --> 00:00:34,003
[SPEAKER_11]: How about that?

14
00:00:34,844 --> 00:00:35,264
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.

15
00:00:35,664 --> 00:00:36,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

00:00:36,465 --> 00:00:36,985

[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not seeing.

22
00:00:47,111 --> 00:00:51,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.

23
00:00:51,313 --> 00:00:51,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Luke?

00:00:52,954 --> 00:00:53,454

00:00:59,218 --> 00:00:59,738

00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:01,839

[SPEAKER_03]: Will is here.

34
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:14,460
[SPEAKER_03]: Sarah?

35
00:01:16,101 --> 00:01:16,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Here.

36
00:01:17,422 --> 00:01:17,943
[SPEAKER_03]: And Paul?

37
00:01:19,384 --> 00:01:19,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

38
00:01:20,585 --> 00:01:22,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

39
00:01:22,986 --> 00:01:23,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

40
00:01:24,227 --> 00:01:27,249
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not seeing any guests with us right now to introduce.

41
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:33,254
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that, has everyone had a chance to review the minutes that Brenda sent out?

42
00:01:39,543 --> 00:01:39,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

43
00:01:40,524 --> 00:01:43,487
[SPEAKER_03]: I would entertain a motion to accept and we can get started.

44
00:01:44,268 --> 00:01:52,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I suggest that we accept it with the revision of changing the... Oh, no, never mind.

45
00:01:53,918 --> 00:01:54,859
[SPEAKER_07]: That was corrected before.

46
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:55,580
[SPEAKER_07]: I take it back.

47
00:01:57,001 --> 00:01:57,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, good.

48
00:02:07,111 --> 00:02:10,834
[SPEAKER_03]: I would entertain a motion to accept these and you can get started.

49
00:02:15,497 --> 00:02:16,158
[SPEAKER_10]: So moved.

50
00:02:16,938 --> 00:02:17,499
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll second.

51
00:02:18,359 --> 00:02:19,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

52
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,602
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll run down nice and quick.

53
00:02:22,922 --> 00:02:23,643
[SPEAKER_03]: First big vote.

54
00:02:24,243 --> 00:02:26,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Accept these minutes.

55
00:02:27,746 --> 00:02:28,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Just say aye as we go.

56
00:02:28,887 --> 00:02:29,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Lois?

57
00:02:30,368 --> 00:02:30,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

58
00:02:31,288 --> 00:02:31,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Benji?

59
00:02:32,509 --> 00:02:32,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

60
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:33,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Barry?

61
00:02:38,612 --> 00:02:38,792
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

62
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:39,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

63
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:40,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Luke?

64
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:42,634
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to abstain.

65
00:02:42,714 --> 00:02:44,375
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't there, but they look good.

66
00:02:44,395 --> 00:02:46,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

67
00:02:46,956 --> 00:02:47,276
[SPEAKER_03]: Martha?

68
00:02:49,117 --> 00:02:49,257
[SPEAKER_01]: Aye.

69
00:02:50,277 --> 00:02:50,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan?

70
00:02:51,978 --> 00:02:52,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

71
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:53,359
[SPEAKER_03]: Bob?

72
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:53,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

73
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:55,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Will?

74
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:56,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

75
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Sarah?

76
00:02:58,541 --> 00:02:58,641
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

77
00:02:59,622 --> 00:03:00,242
[SPEAKER_03]: And Paul?

78
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:01,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

79
00:03:02,923 --> 00:03:04,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes, minutes accepted.

80
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:06,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's jump right into it.

81
00:03:08,578 --> 00:03:12,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's grab some updates from Brenda.

82
00:03:13,461 --> 00:03:14,201
[SPEAKER_03]: What have we been up to?

83
00:03:17,763 --> 00:03:18,423
[SPEAKER_07]: So much.

84
00:03:19,464 --> 00:03:24,586
[SPEAKER_07]: As I was putting this together, I thought, oh, no, I should probably do slides or something, but I didn't have a chance to.

85
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:29,388
[SPEAKER_07]: But maybe for the next meeting, it might be helpful if I put it together in slides for folks.

86
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:41,327
[SPEAKER_07]: But for Electrify Medford, the energy coaches who can receive stipends are finishing up their paperwork with human resources right now.

87
00:03:42,387 --> 00:03:47,028
[SPEAKER_07]: And the coach trainings start tomorrow with an in-person session at City Hall.

88
00:03:47,909 --> 00:03:53,650
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the next four trainings will be online webinars from ABODE with a Q&A session with ABODE afterwards.

89
00:03:55,831 --> 00:03:58,452
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for everyone here who signed up to be coaches.

90
00:04:00,113 --> 00:04:12,141
[SPEAKER_07]: And just a reminder to Martha and Paul that I still need to do some one-on-one interviews with you just so that I can better match you up with residents who sign up.

91
00:04:16,424 --> 00:04:22,268
[SPEAKER_01]: If you send me some times, Brenda, I'm sure we can find a time.

92
00:04:22,688 --> 00:04:22,848
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

93
00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:23,629
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds good.

94
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:27,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

95
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:27,932
[SPEAKER_07]: Same there, Paul.

96
00:04:27,972 --> 00:04:28,172
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

97
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:37,139
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have a very basic web page on the city's website right now.

98
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:46,365
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me drop it into the chat here, which is medfordma.org slash electrify hyphen Medford.

99
00:04:48,947 --> 00:04:50,908
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have an introductory flyer.

100
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:53,870
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me pull this up here.

101
00:05:05,711 --> 00:05:18,262
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is just a first draft of a very basic flyer here, but we have a QR code that takes you to a sign-up form that collects some basic information that then we will follow up with.

102
00:05:18,462 --> 00:05:28,391
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the coaches that folks are matched to will then do a more in-depth questionnaire while having a conversation with them.

103
00:05:29,652 --> 00:05:32,655
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we're going to have more information

104
00:05:33,678 --> 00:05:42,223
[SPEAKER_07]: Then the website or this this flyer obviously has on the go green Medford website that is not all available yet.

105
00:05:43,924 --> 00:05:54,671
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's where that's going to be the main repository of information, including, you know, basic information about the technologies and incentives and technical assistance that's available.

106
00:05:56,502 --> 00:06:03,303
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, of course, there's the coach sign-up form, because we will continue to be accepting people as coaches as we go through the program.

107
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:16,626
[SPEAKER_07]: But I will send this flyer out to everyone after the meeting, and I would love to get your feedback on this and the website.

108
00:06:18,306 --> 00:06:20,567
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have this flyer translated yet, but we will.

109
00:06:23,322 --> 00:06:29,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and then when we get more detailed information up in the Go Green Medford site, I'll send that along to you as well to get some feedback.

110
00:06:38,968 --> 00:06:43,050
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's everything for Electrify Medford, unless folks have questions.

111
00:06:48,402 --> 00:06:49,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like a great start.

112
00:06:49,923 --> 00:06:56,507
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of those connections are to the Go Green Medford.

113
00:06:56,527 --> 00:07:01,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm just following some of those links.

114
00:07:01,669 --> 00:07:02,230
[SPEAKER_02]: That is great.

115
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

116
00:07:05,772 --> 00:07:10,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and we have been connected with a professor

117
00:07:12,797 --> 00:07:21,544
[SPEAKER_07]: like a marketing professor over at Northeastern who lives in Medford and is really interested in helping out with the program.

118
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:40,738
[SPEAKER_07]: So he and some of his students and some of his colleagues are going to be helping us out doing some sort of tweaking of the messaging for the Electrify Medford program, doing some A-B testing of different messaging out there to try to perfect it as we move along.

119
00:07:42,442 --> 00:07:44,103
[SPEAKER_07]: in the very early stages of that.

120
00:07:46,584 --> 00:07:47,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Martha?

121
00:07:47,804 --> 00:07:49,825
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that's great.

122
00:07:49,925 --> 00:08:07,771
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know there's a Tufts professor who has been doing research on what makes people decide to install solar and how much of it is dependent on their social network or social interactions.

123
00:08:07,951 --> 00:08:09,932
[SPEAKER_01]: So that might be an interesting.

124
00:08:11,034 --> 00:08:15,957
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually spoke with one of the doctoral students who was working on this.

125
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:24,781
[SPEAKER_01]: So that might be an interesting person or group to help inform what we're doing.

126
00:08:25,461 --> 00:08:26,202
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be great.

127
00:08:26,222 --> 00:08:27,943
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the name of the professor?

128
00:08:28,323 --> 00:08:28,863
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

129
00:08:29,043 --> 00:08:31,484
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll have to ask some people.

130
00:08:31,504 --> 00:08:34,926
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was urban planning program.

131
00:08:39,427 --> 00:08:40,068
[SPEAKER_07]: That makes sense.

132
00:08:40,628 --> 00:08:41,749
[SPEAKER_07]: That was my program.

133
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:43,330
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where I graduated from.

134
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:46,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Me too.

135
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:52,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see what else here.

136
00:08:53,098 --> 00:09:02,646
[SPEAKER_07]: So for the community electricity aggregation, just confirming that we did renew our electricity supply contract that expires at the end of the year.

137
00:09:03,294 --> 00:09:12,417
[SPEAKER_07]: We increased the additional renewable energy content to 10% for a lower cost than people are paying now, and that's going to be locked in for the next three years.

138
00:09:14,338 --> 00:09:16,719
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not doing a lot of messaging about this now.

139
00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:24,041
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll start sharing that with the public in September, because the changeover won't happen until the end of December.

140
00:09:24,401 --> 00:09:27,022
[SPEAKER_07]: So we don't want to confuse people by talking with them about it now.

141
00:09:28,023 --> 00:09:32,104
[SPEAKER_07]: But just to let you know that that's coming, and I'm really excited about it.

142
00:09:34,114 --> 00:09:37,395
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we have to reapply if we're part of it?

143
00:09:38,656 --> 00:09:39,917
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you don't have to reapply.

144
00:09:40,357 --> 00:09:51,562
[SPEAKER_07]: Although we are switching to a different vendor, so they're a different supplier, not a different administrative vendor.

145
00:09:52,862 --> 00:10:01,146
[SPEAKER_07]: So there might be a, you know, there's a possibility there could be some hiccups along the way that we'd have to deal with, but we'll just be really aware of that and make sure that they're

146
00:10:02,113 --> 00:10:04,055
[SPEAKER_07]: If they do crop up, we're prepared for them.

147
00:10:04,075 --> 00:10:19,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Brenda, if I may ask, do we know roughly what percentage of Medford citizens participate and how many have opted out, just generally speaking?

148
00:10:19,127 --> 00:10:25,573
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have that off the top of my head, but I can find it out and let you know.

149
00:10:25,593 --> 00:10:27,554
[SPEAKER_02]: The statistics are available?

150
00:10:28,235 --> 00:10:28,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

151
00:10:29,056 --> 00:10:29,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

152
00:10:38,753 --> 00:10:51,365
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, let's see for the curbside composting program as of well as of two weeks ago now, so I don't have current numbers, but 112 people had had signed up.

153
00:10:52,786 --> 00:10:53,627
[SPEAKER_07]: To start now.

154
00:10:55,108 --> 00:10:58,071
[SPEAKER_07]: And adding that to the people who are already paying for the program.

155
00:10:58,702 --> 00:11:03,926
[SPEAKER_07]: have a total of that was a total of 952 people who are currently composting.

156
00:11:03,946 --> 00:11:08,989
[SPEAKER_07]: And then an additional 912 have signed up to start in July.

157
00:11:09,009 --> 00:11:12,051
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Dan.

158
00:11:13,412 --> 00:11:14,593
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll add one thing.

159
00:11:14,693 --> 00:11:18,716
[SPEAKER_08]: So we had, we had people over this weekend for a kid's birthday party.

160
00:11:19,557 --> 00:11:19,697
[SPEAKER_08]: And

161
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:28,026
[SPEAKER_08]: There were three people who mentioned that they had signed up for the program and learned about it from the billboard on 93.

162
00:11:28,967 --> 00:11:41,938
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so whoever made that decision, uh, that, that seems to be a huge, um, uh, uh, success, um, and getting a lot of people to sign up.

163
00:11:43,359 --> 00:11:44,280
[SPEAKER_07]: That's great to hear.

164
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:44,640
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

165
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,802
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of bang for the buck there.

166
00:11:47,843 --> 00:11:49,885
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I also have.

167
00:11:51,113 --> 00:11:55,996
[SPEAKER_07]: these lovely door hangers in my office.

168
00:11:56,296 --> 00:12:00,939
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're looking for people to go door to door to get the word out.

169
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:18,889
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're interested in helping out even just for your street, you can pick up door hangers in my office and sign up for your street on Garbage to Garden put together this little spreadsheet that I just dropped in the chat to

170
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:30,787
[SPEAKER_07]: Organize people mothers out front are going to be doing some door to door outreach as well.

171
00:12:33,569 --> 00:12:36,592
[SPEAKER_07]: But, yeah, it would be great if if folks on the energy committee could help as well.

172
00:12:41,516 --> 00:12:48,662
[SPEAKER_07]: And also garbage to garden is having a bulk compost and bin distribution event on May 18th at City Hall.

173
00:13:01,821 --> 00:13:10,007
[SPEAKER_07]: So we applied for an earmark to help the Medford Housing Authority replace the Willis Ave Community Center.

174
00:13:12,149 --> 00:13:26,979
[SPEAKER_07]: And the idea is that it will be replaced with a center that's larger and in much better condition with heat pumps, with solar panels, so they can offer more services all year round, and it can serve as sort of a trusted location.

175
00:13:28,033 --> 00:13:31,075
[SPEAKER_07]: for people to go to during emergencies like power outages.

176
00:13:32,736 --> 00:13:49,447
[SPEAKER_07]: And right now it offers like after school and summer programs, food distribution, computer learning, but they would like to add other programs there they don't have space for, like moving to work, family self-sufficiency programs, additional reading programs, daycare, senior programs.

177
00:13:49,527 --> 00:13:55,791
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're really happy to work with them on this earmark request.

178
00:13:57,118 --> 00:14:00,319
[SPEAKER_07]: These federal requests are, it's a long process.

179
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:06,081
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll know this summer if the project is going to be supported by our congressional delegation.

180
00:14:07,462 --> 00:14:11,283
[SPEAKER_07]: But we wouldn't be officially awarded the funding until the summer of next year.

181
00:14:11,303 --> 00:14:23,607
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is part of a larger effort to have multiple resilient community centers, or also known as resilience hubs around the city.

182
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:35,787
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we've talked before about the Andrews School having some electrical rewiring done to put more things on the backup circuit, so that could also be used as a resilience hub.

183
00:14:43,569 --> 00:14:49,310
[SPEAKER_07]: So for the Andrews and McGlynn HVAC upgrades,

184
00:14:50,230 --> 00:15:00,414
[SPEAKER_07]: We presented to the school committee last week about our plans to replace the heating and cooling systems there with heat pumps and condensing boilers backup.

185
00:15:01,754 --> 00:15:08,677
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're in the process of hiring an owner's agent, an owner's project manager and a design engineer to design the system.

186
00:15:10,177 --> 00:15:18,120
[SPEAKER_07]: But I also want to add that at the same meeting, the school committee passed a resolution banning the purchase of fossil fuel equipment for schools unless the school committee authorizes it.

187
00:15:18,493 --> 00:15:20,175
[SPEAKER_07]: So they authorized it for this project.

188
00:15:20,955 --> 00:15:28,262
[SPEAKER_07]: And moving forward, we have to go to them to with justification for why we would be installing a fossil fuel system.

189
00:15:31,345 --> 00:15:33,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I think we have guests.

190
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:05,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome if we do we want to move our agenda.

191
00:16:05,877 --> 00:16:13,020
[SPEAKER_05]: Up, I can come back to the updates afterwards if that's helpful.

192
00:16:22,924 --> 00:16:25,405
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I'm not hearing anything yet, but.

193
00:16:26,658 --> 00:16:29,719
[SPEAKER_03]: I trust that they'll maybe message us if they're feeling ready.

194
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,701
[SPEAKER_03]: I told them 7 o'clock, so we'll give them a couple more minutes.

195
00:16:33,721 --> 00:16:34,221
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds good.

196
00:16:34,321 --> 00:16:35,402
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'll keep going then.

197
00:16:37,243 --> 00:16:40,384
[SPEAKER_07]: Any questions or anything about the school HVAC upgrades?

198
00:16:44,426 --> 00:16:53,610
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a question about, this may be in the resilience planning, but we have a number of institutions in the city

199
00:16:54,512 --> 00:17:03,620
[SPEAKER_01]: You have Atrius Health, we have the Lawrence, Old Lawrence Hospital, which I think is part of a larger healthcare organization now.

200
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:08,144
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have United Healthcare in Wellington.

201
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:15,070
[SPEAKER_01]: We obviously have Tufts and some Leslie presence, the Leslie Nursing School.

202
00:17:15,431 --> 00:17:22,037
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm wondering if you reached out to working with those partner, them as partners on resilience

203
00:17:23,783 --> 00:17:24,703
[SPEAKER_01]: for the community.

204
00:17:25,684 --> 00:17:43,053
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I got interested in this because I was researching what Boston Medical Center has been doing with their community to create a resilience hub that supports the community in times of weather events or crises.

205
00:17:47,935 --> 00:17:48,956
[SPEAKER_07]: That's interesting.

206
00:17:49,296 --> 00:17:49,396
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

207
00:17:50,323 --> 00:17:56,908
[SPEAKER_07]: So Boston Medical Center has the space to be able to be that location during the event of an emergency?

208
00:17:57,568 --> 00:18:00,791
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not so much that they provide a space.

209
00:18:01,311 --> 00:18:11,759
[SPEAKER_01]: They provide energy backup and energy to nonprofits and organizations around them, like the police station.

210
00:18:11,779 --> 00:18:17,483
[SPEAKER_01]: They provide the energy to the facilities that would be used.

211
00:18:19,415 --> 00:18:31,366
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have a number of programs, but one of them is that they have an energy plant, which can survive.

212
00:18:31,846 --> 00:18:37,512
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they're a hospital, they have to have the power to last three days during a blackout.

213
00:18:38,012 --> 00:18:41,115
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are extending that to the community.

214
00:18:42,134 --> 00:18:50,101
[SPEAKER_01]: But it just in general, the idea, it occurred to me the idea of tapping these institutions which have determination of need requirement.

215
00:18:50,121 --> 00:18:54,945
[SPEAKER_01]: They have requirements to give back to the community where they're located.

216
00:18:54,985 --> 00:18:58,128
[SPEAKER_01]: And it might be nice to start engaging them.

217
00:19:01,711 --> 00:19:02,612
[SPEAKER_07]: That's interesting.

218
00:19:02,732 --> 00:19:04,613
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure if we've spoken to them before.

219
00:19:04,713 --> 00:19:05,494
[SPEAKER_07]: I certainly haven't.

220
00:19:05,874 --> 00:19:08,297
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll talk to Alicia to see if she has.

221
00:19:09,197 --> 00:19:09,878
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really helpful.

222
00:19:16,297 --> 00:19:23,182
[SPEAKER_07]: We got an electric street sweeper in January, thanks to, in part to some funding from MassDEP.

223
00:19:23,803 --> 00:19:27,546
[SPEAKER_07]: And we started using it during the big sweep in April.

224
00:19:29,807 --> 00:19:32,449
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's some mixed feedback here.

225
00:19:32,489 --> 00:19:34,531
[SPEAKER_07]: The operator likes it a lot better.

226
00:19:35,011 --> 00:19:41,456
[SPEAKER_07]: He says it doesn't leave kind of a snail trail of dirt behind it that he has to go back and to get a second time.

227
00:19:41,476 --> 00:19:43,177
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's a lot quieter.

228
00:19:44,403 --> 00:19:50,028
[SPEAKER_07]: DPW folks described as creepy quiet when the brushes aren't on.

229
00:19:51,028 --> 00:19:56,633
[SPEAKER_07]: But the DPW is troubleshooting some charging issues with it and working with the manufacturer to resolve it.

230
00:19:58,234 --> 00:20:08,482
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I don't know if that's something we're going to, they're going to end up being able to fix those issues or if they're going to try to switch to a different,

231
00:20:10,217 --> 00:20:11,318
[SPEAKER_07]: model of it completely.

232
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:18,181
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll see if that if that sticks around, but they're definitely excited to have the electric street sweeper.

233
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:26,024
[SPEAKER_07]: And we've also been awarded a grant to buy an electric refuse truck for for park maintenance.

234
00:20:27,265 --> 00:20:32,707
[SPEAKER_07]: So we contract out the actual trash pickup to a third party.

235
00:20:32,727 --> 00:20:38,810
[SPEAKER_07]: So that but this would be a city owned refuse truck that we would be using for city trash pickup.

236
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:54,988
[SPEAKER_07]: We held another training on the stretch and specialized energy code for building inspectors at the library on May 1st.

237
00:20:56,109 --> 00:20:58,270
[SPEAKER_07]: And this one was focused on the commercial code.

238
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:00,192
[SPEAKER_07]: The first one was on the residential code.

239
00:21:01,013 --> 00:21:09,300
[SPEAKER_07]: And then after this, we'd like to hold one for building owners, developers, contractors, essentially anyone in the public who's interested in getting into the details of this.

240
00:21:10,771 --> 00:21:12,072
[SPEAKER_07]: before July 1st.

241
00:21:18,535 --> 00:21:20,716
[SPEAKER_07]: We have some events coming up.

242
00:21:23,617 --> 00:21:27,179
[SPEAKER_07]: We had a couple of events in the last couple of weeks.

243
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:35,943
[SPEAKER_07]: There was the Boston Glory Renewable Fest and the community cleanup all the weekend of April 26th.

244
00:21:38,484 --> 00:21:47,808
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that the Renewable Fest was maybe more of a visibility event than the actual interactive event.

245
00:21:47,928 --> 00:21:54,832
[SPEAKER_07]: We did have a few people come over and speak with us, but most people were coming and going sort of directly to their seats.

246
00:21:55,492 --> 00:21:58,393
[SPEAKER_07]: So we didn't talk to a lot of people directly.

247
00:22:00,114 --> 00:22:02,195
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was an interesting and a fun event.

248
00:22:06,252 --> 00:22:10,013
[SPEAKER_07]: And the community cleanup was on the 26th.

249
00:22:10,393 --> 00:22:12,093
[SPEAKER_07]: That was more of a sort of a distributed thing.

250
00:22:12,133 --> 00:22:15,234
[SPEAKER_07]: So we weren't using that to get information out about things.

251
00:22:15,314 --> 00:22:20,375
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think there were more than 400 people signed up across the city to do the cleanup.

252
00:22:20,735 --> 00:22:21,655
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was pretty exciting.

253
00:22:26,576 --> 00:22:32,657
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a rain barrel distribution event on May 8th.

254
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:40,055
[SPEAKER_07]: Lois, it sounds like you might know more about this than I do at this point.

255
00:22:40,075 --> 00:22:42,996
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds like you're very involved in planning that.

256
00:22:44,757 --> 00:22:54,401
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Alicia does the planning, but I've participated three or four times now.

257
00:22:57,502 --> 00:22:59,423
[SPEAKER_10]: I like it.

258
00:23:00,123 --> 00:23:03,245
[SPEAKER_10]: It's outdoors, it's physical.

259
00:23:04,353 --> 00:23:09,134
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's nice to help people do it.

260
00:23:09,374 --> 00:23:14,035
[SPEAKER_10]: So if anybody has time Wednesday afternoon, I think we're going three to seven.

261
00:23:15,496 --> 00:23:15,696
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

262
00:23:15,736 --> 00:23:18,016
[SPEAKER_07]: But you also don't have to stay the whole time.

263
00:23:18,036 --> 00:23:21,977
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we need the most help at three o'clock and at five o'clock.

264
00:23:22,017 --> 00:23:24,538
[SPEAKER_07]: So three o'clock is when the barrels come in and we're getting them off the truck.

265
00:23:24,978 --> 00:23:26,958
[SPEAKER_07]: And five o'clock is when the most people come through.

266
00:23:26,978 --> 00:23:33,300
[SPEAKER_10]: I usually get kids from the school to do the unloading.

267
00:23:35,449 --> 00:23:47,578
[SPEAKER_10]: I've done it also, and it's not that difficult, but usually there's a troop full of kids that are out there doing it all and having a fine time.

268
00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:56,085
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that this Wednesday, it's one of the half days for the school, so there probably won't be a lot of kids around.

269
00:23:56,105 --> 00:23:59,847
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I think these are volunteers.

270
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:04,491
[SPEAKER_10]: They have these programs where they have to do so many hours of volunteer work.

271
00:24:05,442 --> 00:24:09,425
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think a lot of times that's, they sign up to do it.

272
00:24:10,526 --> 00:24:10,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

273
00:24:14,129 --> 00:24:16,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Apologies, where did you say this is?

274
00:24:16,931 --> 00:24:17,491
[SPEAKER_03]: This event?

275
00:24:17,751 --> 00:24:21,294
[SPEAKER_10]: High school, in the parking lot out front.

276
00:24:22,014 --> 00:24:23,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, thank you.

277
00:24:24,076 --> 00:24:33,363
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, we need people to direct traffic because at some point it lines up all the way down the driveway onto Winthrop Street and

278
00:24:35,064 --> 00:24:38,606
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, we have to cope with stuff like that.

279
00:24:39,986 --> 00:24:48,110
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds like to speed things up, you go down the line, giving people sort of tickets, color coded tickets that they can show when they get up there to get their barrel.

280
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:54,352
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we have to double up the lines because there's so many people we pull people up.

281
00:24:54,452 --> 00:25:00,395
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a lot of volunteers, and it's a nice effort.

282
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:07,591
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

283
00:25:07,651 --> 00:25:10,552
[SPEAKER_01]: I have something to throw in on the government side.

284
00:25:10,572 --> 00:25:13,793
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm putting the link in the chat.

285
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:28,357
[SPEAKER_01]: MassDOT has a meeting Wednesday night, the 8th, about the intersection of Main Street with South Street in that area.

286
00:25:28,597 --> 00:25:33,159
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not only an area that's incredibly important to Medford.

287
00:25:34,477 --> 00:25:39,299
[SPEAKER_01]: residents for walkability and safety and connectivity.

288
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:54,086
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also an opportunity to ask MassDOT about some other Medford issues, like I know they are cooking a plan for some of our rotaries, but they haven't talked about it publicly.

289
00:25:54,206 --> 00:25:58,888
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope to go to that meeting and I thought other people might want to know about it.

290
00:26:00,654 --> 00:26:02,175
[SPEAKER_10]: And you put it in the chat, Martha?

291
00:26:02,215 --> 00:26:02,975
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I did.

292
00:26:03,696 --> 00:26:04,396
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you see it?

293
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:06,477
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to look for it.

294
00:26:07,258 --> 00:26:09,499
[SPEAKER_01]: It says NASA.gov event.

295
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,142
[SPEAKER_07]: When you click on it, it says the link is broken, but that's only because there's a period at the end.

296
00:26:14,162 --> 00:26:15,823
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you delete the period, then it should be broken.

297
00:26:15,883 --> 00:26:16,063
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, OK.

298
00:26:16,083 --> 00:26:16,864
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my bad.

299
00:26:16,984 --> 00:26:17,224
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

300
00:26:21,433 --> 00:26:26,554
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds like this was something that was planned sort of relatively short notice.

301
00:26:26,634 --> 00:26:31,915
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's been a flurry of activity the last few days trying to get the word out about it.

302
00:26:39,237 --> 00:26:42,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that is a very important intersection with a lot of challenges.

303
00:26:42,597 --> 00:26:42,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

304
00:26:52,260 --> 00:27:02,927
[SPEAKER_07]: In terms of events, I'm also dropping in the chat a link to this spreadsheet.

305
00:27:03,047 --> 00:27:05,088
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, let me share my screen for a second too.

306
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:18,276
[SPEAKER_07]: For potential tabling events for the Electrify Medford program.

307
00:27:20,743 --> 00:27:29,648
[SPEAKER_07]: And we've talked about a lot of these before, but this is just a spreadsheet we're just going to have as a central place if people are interested in signing up to help table for the events.

308
00:27:31,369 --> 00:27:42,615
[SPEAKER_07]: And if there are other things that aren't on here that you think would be a good thing to add, feel free to just drop it at the end of the list or to email me about it.

309
00:27:44,056 --> 00:27:48,018
[SPEAKER_07]: The big ones are obviously Circle the Square on June 15th.

310
00:27:49,627 --> 00:27:52,508
[SPEAKER_07]: and the Harvest Your Energy Festival on October 19th.

311
00:27:53,129 --> 00:28:07,955
[SPEAKER_07]: And for both of those, I'm going to have some cute carnival type games actually that I recently saw at a conference that we were able to rent for these events that have a climate change related theme to each one of them.

312
00:28:07,995 --> 00:28:11,757
[SPEAKER_07]: So hopefully that'll be a nice draw to pull people in to chat.

313
00:28:31,428 --> 00:28:36,090
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's after seven o'clock, Will.

314
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:37,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think we should pause here?

315
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:39,751
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.

316
00:28:39,771 --> 00:28:45,553
[SPEAKER_03]: I can, oh, I guess we're just in time.

317
00:28:45,573 --> 00:28:46,653
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

318
00:28:48,474 --> 00:28:56,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, without further ado, State Senator Mike Barrett has joined us to tell us a little bit about what's going on here in Mass.

319
00:28:58,219 --> 00:28:59,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome, welcome.

320
00:28:59,579 --> 00:29:00,160
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, Will.

321
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,020
[SPEAKER_09]: Very happy to be here.

322
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,581
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell me about Electrified Medford.

323
00:29:06,561 --> 00:29:12,643
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, so this is our decarbonization outreach campaign.

324
00:29:12,683 --> 00:29:20,585
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to be talking about energy efficiency, renewables, electric vehicles, anything else that people want to talk about.

325
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:25,907
[SPEAKER_07]: If they want to talk about biking or anything, we'd be happy to talk with them about it.

326
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:33,702
[SPEAKER_07]: and connect with them with technical assistance and with incentives and other programs that are available to them.

327
00:29:34,583 --> 00:29:39,425
[SPEAKER_09]: Has the city adopted the specialized stretch energy code as of yet?

328
00:29:40,186 --> 00:29:40,906
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, we have.

329
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:41,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations.

330
00:29:41,907 --> 00:29:47,510
[SPEAKER_07]: We've held two in-person training sessions for building inspectors.

331
00:29:48,311 --> 00:29:50,372
[SPEAKER_09]: I heard, yes, I've been spying on you.

332
00:29:51,432 --> 00:29:52,893
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

333
00:29:52,973 --> 00:29:55,955
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to hear a little bit about local discussion before we

334
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,161
[SPEAKER_09]: talked about anything statewide.

335
00:29:58,201 --> 00:30:00,783
[SPEAKER_09]: So I have been I have been listening in for a while.

336
00:30:00,803 --> 00:30:06,507
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm very impressed with the two workshops that you're either teed up or have already conducted.

337
00:30:06,768 --> 00:30:18,697
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm very happy to be here for the informally because there's no formal designation, the Joint Committee on telecommunications, utilities and energy.

338
00:30:20,049 --> 00:30:24,311
[SPEAKER_09]: long name, is effectively the Climate Policy Committee.

339
00:30:24,711 --> 00:30:26,472
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's a House chair, Jeff Roy.

340
00:30:26,592 --> 00:30:27,512
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm the Senate chair.

341
00:30:29,293 --> 00:30:31,674
[SPEAKER_09]: But all senators take a lively.

342
00:30:31,734 --> 00:30:41,418
[SPEAKER_09]: You happen to have a terrific state senator, Pat Jalen, who's a very nice person and as a result is sometimes underestimated.

343
00:30:41,558 --> 00:30:45,359
[SPEAKER_09]: She's nice, but extremely persistent and very principled.

344
00:30:45,439 --> 00:30:48,161
[SPEAKER_09]: And she has a major impact on climate policy herself.

345
00:30:53,111 --> 00:30:59,495
[SPEAKER_09]: So as you guys may know, two major climate bills have passed in the last two sessions, one bill per session.

346
00:31:00,196 --> 00:31:12,924
[SPEAKER_09]: Each of these bills has had 50 to 60 moving parts, sometimes related to one another, but sometimes operating in disparate areas from EV charging to offshore wind.

347
00:31:13,564 --> 00:31:17,607
[SPEAKER_09]: So the roadmap bill passed in

348
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:30,183
[SPEAKER_09]: 2021, actually, I guess, signed technically in 2022, because Governor Baker vetoed it at first, was a major piece with 50 to 60 segments.

349
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:32,684
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we passed the so-called DRIVE Act.

350
00:31:32,744 --> 00:31:39,325
[SPEAKER_09]: I say so-called because these are informal monikers attached to these bills that have formal names as well.

351
00:31:39,806 --> 00:31:45,087
[SPEAKER_09]: The DRIVE Act began as an offshore wind piece, but expanded just like the

352
00:31:46,773 --> 00:31:58,416
[SPEAKER_09]: earlier roadmap bill to include everything under the sun, and that's partially because legislators are engaged and come at us with all kinds of ideas and we try to accommodate them.

353
00:31:58,496 --> 00:32:09,278
[SPEAKER_09]: So in 2024, my prediction is that you're going to see a third major omnibus climate thingy,

354
00:32:10,912 --> 00:32:14,894
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been working extremely hard on it since before Thanksgiving.

355
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:24,821
[SPEAKER_09]: Someone actually has to do the legal writing and I enjoy that work and I've spent a great deal of time doing it.

356
00:32:24,881 --> 00:32:34,648
[SPEAKER_09]: But the rest of the time is spent talking to other legislators who have ideas of their own to represent their districts.

357
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:45,086
[SPEAKER_09]: And then there also have been a number of working groups we set up because of these two earlier conglomerations to do all manner of things.

358
00:32:45,166 --> 00:32:50,608
[SPEAKER_09]: And each of these working groups or commissions takes its work or their work very seriously.

359
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:53,949
[SPEAKER_09]: So there have been drafts on everything under the sun.

360
00:32:54,009 --> 00:32:57,990
[SPEAKER_09]: There has been a clean energy transmission working group.

361
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:02,591
[SPEAKER_09]: There has been an electric vehicle intergovernmental coordinating council.

362
00:33:03,051 --> 00:33:03,691
[SPEAKER_09]: There has been a

363
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:16,527
[SPEAKER_09]: working group to rethink GCEP, which is the program set up, the gas safety enhancement program set up to plug leaky underground gas pipes.

364
00:33:17,127 --> 00:33:22,571
[SPEAKER_09]: And there is a commission on siting and permitting, which just reported last week.

365
00:33:22,631 --> 00:33:29,895
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can see its report, which has a lot, which touches on the city, not explicitly Medford, but city government

366
00:33:30,835 --> 00:33:34,116
[SPEAKER_09]: and local government across the state very intimately.

367
00:33:34,216 --> 00:33:52,524
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you Google M-A-C-E-I-S-P, clean energy infrastructure siting and permitting, C-E-I-S-P, a page will come up and you can take a look at the draft, actually it's the report.

368
00:33:53,784 --> 00:33:57,306
[SPEAKER_09]: Now there are many steps still, and this just gives you a sense about how

369
00:33:58,037 --> 00:34:04,402
[SPEAKER_09]: complex the legislative processes, although you already know that because you take part in city government, which I know is complex as well.

370
00:34:05,243 --> 00:34:26,280
[SPEAKER_09]: But in this particular instance, we had this commission appointed by the governor, representing at least five major interests that have to do with the siting and permitting of everything from major transmission lines through the city, but also offshore windmills,

371
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:36,006
[SPEAKER_09]: offshore wind farms and ground-mounted solar fields where they technically, and they're usually found in Central and Western Mass where the land is available.

372
00:34:36,486 --> 00:34:55,140
[SPEAKER_09]: So everything from clean energy generation, and that would be wind and solar primarily, to transmission and distribution, routing the stuff to your house, but also taking the electrons from your rooftop solar panels and distributing them.

373
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:56,560
[SPEAKER_09]: to the grid.

374
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:05,163
[SPEAKER_09]: So we need a bi-directional grid delivering stuff to you, but also taking stuff that you generate and distributing it back to the grid.

375
00:35:05,343 --> 00:35:11,144
[SPEAKER_09]: And interestingly, the current electric grid in Massachusetts is not bi-directional.

376
00:35:12,305 --> 00:35:23,488
[SPEAKER_09]: It was built to take energy or electrons from a few central power plants, fossil fuel typically, and to deliver them unit-directionally to you or to the city.

377
00:35:25,214 --> 00:35:42,584
[SPEAKER_09]: The idea that we would have to treat you as an energy generator, which is a good thing, because of your solar panels, maybe your batteries in the future, and take those electrons and take them away from you back to the community at large is a new concept.

378
00:35:42,644 --> 00:35:45,626
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, new in the sense that it's 10 or 20 years old.

379
00:35:46,206 --> 00:35:48,508
[SPEAKER_09]: And the grid isn't built yet to do that.

380
00:35:51,000 --> 00:36:06,330
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm getting us off on a tangent, but the long and the short of it is this, that the siting and permitting process has to do with creating a true bidirectional grid, but also making sure that offshore windmills can get electrons to the city.

381
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:19,338
[SPEAKER_09]: And that for that matter, a ground mounted solar field out in Irving could transmit its clean electricity toward Eastern Mass where the load is, where the customers tend to be.

382
00:36:21,302 --> 00:36:27,826
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's why this is a so we're going to have a major bill and it starts with the siting and permitting thing.

383
00:36:28,266 --> 00:36:34,409
[SPEAKER_09]: That's going to be hot and and is going to need your engagement.

384
00:36:34,429 --> 00:36:36,170
[SPEAKER_09]: And also, we're going to need your feedback.

385
00:36:37,531 --> 00:36:39,412
[SPEAKER_09]: You might pass it through your state reps.

386
00:36:39,432 --> 00:36:46,576
[SPEAKER_09]: You might pass it to Senator Jalen or you might communicate directly to to me and to the house chair of TUE.

387
00:36:47,735 --> 00:36:51,839
[SPEAKER_09]: But we need to hear about whether we're striking the right balance.

388
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:56,823
[SPEAKER_09]: And here's the balance that we are attempting to strike, and it's why it's so delicate.

389
00:36:59,086 --> 00:37:00,207
[SPEAKER_09]: NIMBYism is real.

390
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:06,793
[SPEAKER_09]: And NIMBYism, that might be unfair, because a lot of times rejections of projects at the local level are heartfelt.

391
00:37:07,873 --> 00:37:10,234
[SPEAKER_09]: and well-supported, but sometimes they're not.

392
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:16,936
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes it's just resistance to housing or resistance to, in this case, energy facilities.

393
00:37:17,516 --> 00:37:26,159
[SPEAKER_09]: So the question is, how do we balance local control and the local voice with the need to realize a statewide set of objectives?

394
00:37:26,839 --> 00:37:28,159
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no magic answer.

395
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:34,662
[SPEAKER_09]: I can promise you that this commission has considered every conceivable nook and cranny of the issue.

396
00:37:37,759 --> 00:37:45,886
[SPEAKER_09]: And what that report posted online recommends, I was the Senate's sole member.

397
00:37:46,686 --> 00:37:48,408
[SPEAKER_09]: Chair Roy was the House's sole member.

398
00:37:48,648 --> 00:37:52,011
[SPEAKER_09]: Most folks were from the executive branch or the private sector.

399
00:37:53,532 --> 00:37:54,853
[SPEAKER_09]: And we all voted on this stuff.

400
00:37:55,133 --> 00:38:01,559
[SPEAKER_09]: What that recommendation essentially, and I'm oversimplifying just a little bit, recommends is this.

401
00:38:02,745 --> 00:38:26,953
[SPEAKER_09]: that energy facilities defined as both generation and transmission be treated in a rough fashion the way that we treat housing under Chapter 40B, which is to say that in lieu of a whole bunch of separate permits issued locally and considered locally, seriatim, one at a time, there would be a comprehensive permit

402
00:38:27,959 --> 00:38:44,374
[SPEAKER_09]: that a developer, it could be Eversource in the case of distribution and transmission, it could be a solar developer company, although they would tend, as I say, to look to central and western Massa sites, but they would apply for a single consolidated permit.

403
00:38:46,095 --> 00:38:53,562
[SPEAKER_09]: If the city granted the permit, but with restrictions or alternatively denied the permit,

404
00:38:54,858 --> 00:39:02,823
[SPEAKER_09]: that denial or grant with restrictions would be appealable to an enhanced energy facility siting board, a statewide entity that already exists.

405
00:39:04,004 --> 00:39:22,817
[SPEAKER_09]: The difference from the current state of affairs is that, remember, all the local stuff, the Conservation Commission, Board of Public Health, Zoning Board, City Council, of course, all of that stuff would be

406
00:39:23,977 --> 00:39:27,940
[SPEAKER_09]: rolled up into a one comprehensive proceeding at the local level.

407
00:39:29,061 --> 00:39:36,546
[SPEAKER_09]: It could then be appealed if a denial were issued locally or if the developer felt that the conditions were onerous.

408
00:39:37,206 --> 00:39:42,750
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you would have this enhanced state board consider the local situation.

409
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:53,257
[SPEAKER_09]: I know some of you are lawyers, de novo, meaning that they would take a look at the facts fresh and make the same determination that Medford had made locally

410
00:39:54,460 --> 00:40:04,423
[SPEAKER_09]: not the same outcome, but it would consider the same ball of wax, the same complex pros and cons, that decision would be controlling.

411
00:40:04,963 --> 00:40:18,887
[SPEAKER_09]: So essentially, and there could be a way, and I shouldn't prejudge this, there could be a sense in which this is a little less controversial for a city than it is for

412
00:40:20,107 --> 00:40:22,709
[SPEAKER_09]: a town and in particular, a small town.

413
00:40:22,789 --> 00:40:23,309
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

414
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:29,914
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll have to tell me in this conversation how consequential this all seems to you.

415
00:40:30,614 --> 00:40:44,784
[SPEAKER_09]: But the long and the short of it is one comprehensive permit considered locally, appealable in one fell swoop, not over time, but at the end of the local consideration, by the way, would be time limited, probably 15 months.

416
00:40:45,745 --> 00:40:48,086
[SPEAKER_09]: So everything has to happen in Medford in 15 months.

417
00:40:49,662 --> 00:40:51,543
[SPEAKER_09]: If it doesn't, it's considered approved.

418
00:40:52,624 --> 00:40:54,084
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's no option to delay.

419
00:40:55,625 --> 00:41:00,768
[SPEAKER_09]: And nor is there an option to appeal in order to obtain a delay.

420
00:41:01,288 --> 00:41:05,890
[SPEAKER_09]: It goes up to the statewide entity, which itself has only 15 months.

421
00:41:07,791 --> 00:41:14,995
[SPEAKER_09]: After that, you could litigate it, but only a single appeal to the SJC.

422
00:41:16,496 --> 00:41:18,417
[SPEAKER_09]: And that essentially means that

423
00:41:19,105 --> 00:41:28,452
[SPEAKER_09]: this process we all read about and that some of you know about, where there are multiple proceedings locally, and then they go up to some state entity.

424
00:41:28,492 --> 00:41:30,734
[SPEAKER_09]: It could be this Energy Facilities Society Board.

425
00:41:30,794 --> 00:41:32,595
[SPEAKER_09]: It could be the Department of Public Utilities.

426
00:41:33,316 --> 00:41:35,637
[SPEAKER_09]: That could have multiple aspects to it.

427
00:41:35,978 --> 00:41:38,059
[SPEAKER_09]: And then there could be lots of litigation.

428
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,421
[SPEAKER_09]: All of that would end.

429
00:41:41,522 --> 00:41:42,963
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be one stop locally,

430
00:41:44,539 --> 00:41:51,582
[SPEAKER_09]: one stop at the Energy Facility Society Board and then one unified appeal to the Supreme Court of the state.

431
00:41:52,223 --> 00:42:03,208
[SPEAKER_09]: The idea is that all of this would get done even in the case of highly contentious projects within a reasonably finite period of time, perhaps two and a half years.

432
00:42:04,248 --> 00:42:13,573
[SPEAKER_09]: Compared to the present where projects can extend to four years, six years and beyond once you count the litigation delays,

433
00:42:14,388 --> 00:42:17,109
[SPEAKER_09]: this would be a much shorter process.

434
00:42:17,649 --> 00:42:26,752
[SPEAKER_09]: Now the Senate, I just want to mention one other thing, although there's a lot more we could talk about.

435
00:42:28,353 --> 00:42:34,675
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's where the legislative battle is going to develop, possibly.

436
00:42:35,876 --> 00:42:40,057
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't judge the activities of my colleagues, or I should say their interests, but

437
00:42:41,528 --> 00:42:46,570
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's one overarching question that I would be interested to hear from you all about.

438
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:52,272
[SPEAKER_09]: This siting and permitting thing, I'm sure you now realize, is a big deal.

439
00:42:53,692 --> 00:43:02,795
[SPEAKER_09]: But it also accomplishes a very important thing, which is it builds out the electric grid, which does need expansion.

440
00:43:03,716 --> 00:43:04,896
[SPEAKER_09]: It is outmoded.

441
00:43:05,096 --> 00:43:07,217
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure you've read that occasionally.

442
00:43:07,237 --> 00:43:07,977
[SPEAKER_09]: It's so true.

443
00:43:08,497 --> 00:43:10,698
[SPEAKER_09]: It's outmoded across the entire United States.

444
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:16,714
[SPEAKER_09]: And in older states like Massachusetts, it's particularly in need of a major refresh.

445
00:43:18,135 --> 00:43:21,638
[SPEAKER_09]: However, it's going to raise everyone's electric bills.

446
00:43:22,479 --> 00:43:23,900
[SPEAKER_09]: This stuff doesn't come cheap.

447
00:43:25,261 --> 00:43:27,003
[SPEAKER_09]: It's necessary to save the planet.

448
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:29,905
[SPEAKER_09]: These are very climate conscious construction projects.

449
00:43:30,846 --> 00:43:37,131
[SPEAKER_09]: But new construction, especially an entire redo of the entire system for

450
00:43:38,307 --> 00:43:44,270
[SPEAKER_09]: really for the Northeast, but we're talking about Massachusetts, major short and middle term costs.

451
00:43:47,732 --> 00:43:56,736
[SPEAKER_09]: A number of legislators, and I happen to be one of them, feel that we need to match the upsizing of the electric grid with the downsizing of the natural gas system.

452
00:43:57,996 --> 00:43:58,897
[SPEAKER_09]: The grand bargain

453
00:44:00,068 --> 00:44:25,539
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like to see the legislature forge is that if we're going to charge you a lot more for this, as important as it is, and we're going to inconvenience you a little because local prerogatives are going to be infringed in the interest, we think, of necessary expedience, then we should take down the size of the gas grid safely so that people remain warm and safe.

454
00:44:25,899 --> 00:44:29,281
[SPEAKER_09]: But still, it could be downsized and save people some money

455
00:44:30,073 --> 00:44:35,616
[SPEAKER_09]: at the same time that we're upsizing electricity and well, on balance, costing you a little money.

456
00:44:36,156 --> 00:44:43,319
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to see the upsizing and the downsizing conjoined in one major piece of legislation in the next 120 days.

457
00:44:43,379 --> 00:44:46,361
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think, by the way, I think that's what's going to happen.

458
00:44:47,641 --> 00:44:55,505
[SPEAKER_09]: But the counter argument is that we should just do the upsizing of the electric grid, that that's important enough in and of itself.

459
00:44:56,470 --> 00:45:04,157
[SPEAKER_09]: a worthy objective in and of itself, and that we should save the consideration of the future of natural gas to another day.

460
00:45:04,978 --> 00:45:07,100
[SPEAKER_09]: That is going to be a major debate.

461
00:45:08,821 --> 00:45:11,604
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would be interested in what you guys have to say.

462
00:45:12,484 --> 00:45:17,809
[SPEAKER_09]: I won't talk about all kinds of other things that this bill is likely to involve, because I want to hear from you.

463
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:21,913
[SPEAKER_09]: But I just want you all to know that

464
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:39,633
[SPEAKER_09]: this major consideration of the role of local government and approving clean energy infrastructure, broadly defined, is going to be teed up over the, and has to be resolved by the end of July when we go out of session, because we're all running for re-election this year.

465
00:45:40,213 --> 00:45:48,419
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is a short year for us, and all this stuff has to happen, if it's going to happen, by the end of July.

466
00:45:50,221 --> 00:45:51,762
[SPEAKER_09]: Three months, I guess that's three months from now.

467
00:45:54,108 --> 00:45:55,749
[SPEAKER_09]: Piece of cake.

468
00:45:56,089 --> 00:45:56,270
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

469
00:45:56,350 --> 00:45:56,710
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, Luke.

470
00:45:59,011 --> 00:46:00,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, and thank you, Senator Barrett.

471
00:46:00,352 --> 00:46:05,876
[SPEAKER_02]: That is fantastic summary and very interesting.

472
00:46:06,236 --> 00:46:10,879
[SPEAKER_02]: And it sounds like powerful moves are underway.

473
00:46:10,899 --> 00:46:20,446
[SPEAKER_02]: I am an energy efficiency nerd and have been on the bleeding edge for quite some time.

474
00:46:22,167 --> 00:46:35,854
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have to say I appreciate the direction you are pushing and legislatively and socially we will benefit, I believe, overall.

475
00:46:37,415 --> 00:46:46,179
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that the point that you made near the end is a very real and frankly, to me, somewhat scary one.

476
00:46:48,680 --> 00:47:02,667
[SPEAKER_02]: I certainly pay considerably more for my electric heating in my 1920s house that I have put a lot of effort into weatherizing and air sealing and et cetera.

477
00:47:03,888 --> 00:47:09,671
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not easy to make this transition affordable.

478
00:47:10,772 --> 00:47:16,815
[SPEAKER_02]: And while I appreciate the thought that downsizing the gas

479
00:47:17,615 --> 00:47:27,025
[SPEAKER_02]: network would provide some savings, I'm not quite clear as to how that really will happen.

480
00:47:27,565 --> 00:47:35,874
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do recognize that upscaling our electric infrastructure and having everyone electrify

481
00:47:37,656 --> 00:47:40,538
[SPEAKER_02]: There are definite costs associated with that.

482
00:47:41,919 --> 00:48:05,417
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of our group are working hard on trying to understand how we could not only do that, reduce costs and electrify for ourselves, but also have a focus on those who need more help and who can't afford to make this kind of transition.

483
00:48:07,418 --> 00:48:19,683
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to make sure that as we push through big changes like this, that we are not adversely impacting those who really can't afford to go through this.

484
00:48:20,803 --> 00:48:25,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Our most vulnerable communities and our most vulnerable residents.

485
00:48:26,725 --> 00:48:28,926
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just wanted to ask about that.

486
00:48:32,182 --> 00:48:40,445
[SPEAKER_09]: So there are all kinds of concrete things to think about that kind of make my general comments, I hope, more real, realer.

487
00:48:40,485 --> 00:48:43,326
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not quite sure what the grammatical expression there is.

488
00:48:44,387 --> 00:48:57,252
[SPEAKER_09]: Consider that any gas pipe we currently put into the ground, let's say it is in the interest of replacing a leaky pipe underlying a Medford Street.

489
00:48:58,632 --> 00:49:00,053
[SPEAKER_09]: That new pipe,

490
00:49:00,798 --> 00:49:03,660
[SPEAKER_09]: is going to have a useful life of 30 to 50 years.

491
00:49:04,981 --> 00:49:09,444
[SPEAKER_09]: And it is financed, typically, for as long as 30 years.

492
00:49:10,544 --> 00:49:27,475
[SPEAKER_09]: So when I talk about saving people some money, what I'm talking about is constraining as smartly and as safely as we can, putting new pipes into the ground when they last so long and keep us on a fossil fuel for so long.

493
00:49:28,153 --> 00:49:30,934
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, let me tell you how one would do this.

494
00:49:32,514 --> 00:49:40,797
[SPEAKER_09]: There happens to be, I know this sounds strange, but there happens to be a right to gas that doesn't exist.

495
00:49:41,157 --> 00:49:45,698
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no right to be warm in Massachusetts, but there actually is a law.

496
00:49:45,938 --> 00:49:48,639
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a single paragraph.

497
00:49:49,740 --> 00:50:03,324
[SPEAKER_09]: that gives you the right as a homeowner or a business owner to insist that gas specifically be extended to your property if gas is available in the community at large and is running on a thoroughfare near your property.

498
00:50:03,884 --> 00:50:05,945
[SPEAKER_09]: We would like to rescind that statute.

499
00:50:06,565 --> 00:50:14,607
[SPEAKER_09]: We would like to give the DPU the alternative responsibility to make sure you stay warm and that you stay safe.

500
00:50:15,494 --> 00:50:25,058
[SPEAKER_09]: But we want to give the DPU the ability to consider a heat pump, or maybe network geothermal, maybe weatherizing.

501
00:50:27,379 --> 00:50:40,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Or for that matter, it could be a tankable fossil fuel, which sounds odd, except that if you replace natural gas with propane, the great thing about propane is you could walk away from that.

502
00:50:41,265 --> 00:50:54,070
[SPEAKER_09]: in five to 10 years with the state government's help and stay warm in the interim, whereas the natural gas infrastructure is in there for the long haul and you'll be paying for it forever.

503
00:50:54,670 --> 00:50:57,691
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would like to constrain expansions of the system.

504
00:50:57,751 --> 00:51:01,892
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to rescind the right to gas.

505
00:51:04,453 --> 00:51:06,714
[SPEAKER_09]: And there are a number of provisions.

506
00:51:07,194 --> 00:51:08,195
[SPEAKER_09]: I could be very discreet.

507
00:51:08,215 --> 00:51:09,275
[SPEAKER_09]: There are about a half a dozen.

508
00:51:10,126 --> 00:51:18,491
[SPEAKER_09]: that unnecessarily tilt the playing field today in favor of putting more of that long-lived infrastructure under your feet.

509
00:51:19,991 --> 00:51:29,156
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we can do better, and we have to, because you can't ask people to pay an enhanced electric bill and keep

510
00:51:30,473 --> 00:51:31,974
[SPEAKER_09]: the natural gas bill where it is.

511
00:51:32,074 --> 00:51:36,155
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you have to give them some sort of relief.

512
00:51:36,175 --> 00:51:45,938
[SPEAKER_09]: The Wall Street Journal today, but it's really only representative of articles that I see every week in the New York Times, the Boston Globe, the LA Times, the Atlanta Journal and Constitution.

513
00:51:45,978 --> 00:51:49,419
[SPEAKER_09]: I subscribe to all these newspapers and scan them for climate stuff.

514
00:51:50,199 --> 00:51:55,381
[SPEAKER_09]: The Wall Street Journal today has a report on the rebellion against clean energy.

515
00:51:56,157 --> 00:51:59,358
[SPEAKER_09]: worldwide, especially in Western Europe and the US.

516
00:51:59,858 --> 00:52:03,139
[SPEAKER_09]: California is the case in point for the United States at its sites.

517
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:05,760
[SPEAKER_09]: Why is there a rebellion against clean energy?

518
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:07,481
[SPEAKER_09]: Because of costs.

519
00:52:08,841 --> 00:52:21,766
[SPEAKER_09]: And so you're beginning to see, especially, and it's enabled by people like Trump and by authoritarian people elsewhere in positions of power around the world, you're beginning to see real pushback

520
00:52:22,566 --> 00:52:29,388
[SPEAKER_09]: not on the basis of client denialism, but people basically instead saying, I can't do this anymore.

521
00:52:30,148 --> 00:52:31,248
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't do this anymore.

522
00:52:31,348 --> 00:52:32,688
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't pay for this anymore.

523
00:52:33,248 --> 00:52:37,469
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, they may be misdiagnosing a problem.

524
00:52:38,009 --> 00:52:43,511
[SPEAKER_09]: They may be blaming clean energy infrastructure for costs that are attributable to something else.

525
00:52:43,931 --> 00:52:48,632
[SPEAKER_09]: Politically, as a working politician, it certainly matters to me if they're

526
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:52,931
[SPEAKER_09]: attributing blame, but it's not dispositive.

527
00:52:52,991 --> 00:53:02,493
[SPEAKER_09]: What's controlling for me is that there is a conservative reaction against climate policy that I need to abate.

528
00:53:03,354 --> 00:53:06,955
[SPEAKER_09]: I need to make sure it doesn't become too extreme in Massachusetts.

529
00:53:07,415 --> 00:53:15,517
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm looking for a way to tell people, look, you may have to pay a little more for this, but it's a good cause saving the planet.

530
00:53:16,217 --> 00:53:18,918
[SPEAKER_09]: And meanwhile, we're going to give you some relief over here.

531
00:53:19,662 --> 00:53:22,143
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I'm looking for as an equation.

532
00:53:22,203 --> 00:53:28,466
[SPEAKER_09]: I can tell you, I mean, just to be candid about it, that the House of Representatives doesn't buy into this trade off.

533
00:53:28,927 --> 00:53:35,230
[SPEAKER_09]: They want to just, I mean, I'm talking about some leaders in the Mass House, not your local legislators necessarily.

534
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:37,571
[SPEAKER_09]: They want to just go with building out the grid.

535
00:53:37,611 --> 00:53:47,836
[SPEAKER_09]: And I respectfully maintain that we've got to give people a little bit of a break as we ask them to sacrifice more over here.

536
00:53:54,674 --> 00:54:05,140
[SPEAKER_09]: So what do you guys think about this whole issue of a consolidated permit at the local level in place of a- Do you mind if I ask you- Oh yeah, I'm sorry, yeah.

537
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:06,201
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, Dan, yeah.

538
00:54:06,921 --> 00:54:13,885
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I have a question, and sorry, I'm not too involved in state level politics, so let me know if this-

539
00:54:16,274 --> 00:54:31,102
[SPEAKER_08]: isn't a great question, but I'm interested how, on this sort of legislation, you're working with the federal government, so FERC, and also neighboring states, given Massachusetts is part of ISO New England.

540
00:54:36,197 --> 00:54:46,240
[SPEAKER_08]: There have been multiple transmission projects trying to bring clean energy, bring hydropower from Quebec, from Canada, down through Maine to Massachusetts.

541
00:54:47,821 --> 00:54:49,922
[SPEAKER_08]: FERC recently issued FERC Order 2023 that is trying to

542
00:54:54,183 --> 00:54:55,624
[SPEAKER_08]: simplify the interconnection queue.

543
00:54:56,364 --> 00:55:04,469
[SPEAKER_08]: But still, New England is one of the worst regions for actually interconnecting new projects in the country.

544
00:55:04,489 --> 00:55:22,839
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm interested in how, when you're developing this legislation, how, if at all, you're working with other neighboring states or FERC and the federal government to kind of make these decisions and come up with a good policy that takes into account we import so much of our energy here.

545
00:55:24,061 --> 00:55:25,702
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's a great question, Dan.

546
00:55:26,242 --> 00:55:28,623
[SPEAKER_09]: But the answer, I'm pleased to say, is a great deal.

547
00:55:30,004 --> 00:55:33,686
[SPEAKER_09]: We are up on that stuff for a whole bunch of reasons.

548
00:55:33,846 --> 00:55:41,829
[SPEAKER_09]: The cooperation with other states is being led by Massachusetts, which is the largest of the six New England states.

549
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:45,411
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of conversation that goes on with New York, too.

550
00:55:45,931 --> 00:55:53,315
[SPEAKER_09]: But especially with respect to our five New England state neighbors, as you know, I'm sure you are up on this stuff,

551
00:55:54,408 --> 00:56:01,029
[SPEAKER_09]: We just, for the very first time, issued new RFPs for more offshore wind farms.

552
00:56:02,169 --> 00:56:10,651
[SPEAKER_09]: And the three states, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Massachusetts, effectively created a kind of sub-regional market.

553
00:56:11,291 --> 00:56:20,993
[SPEAKER_09]: We said, as a three-state consortium, we can give you all kinds of market here, not just the 7 million people in Massachusetts, but

554
00:56:22,185 --> 00:56:25,489
[SPEAKER_09]: the three million in Connecticut, the one and a half million or so in Rhode Island.

555
00:56:26,330 --> 00:56:37,382
[SPEAKER_09]: You, the developer of an offshore wind farm, will be able to sell into this larger region, half of New England, if you will, and three quarters of its population and its users.

556
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:43,649
[SPEAKER_09]: So give us a better price because we're cooperating together and giving you a shot at more revenue.

557
00:56:44,412 --> 00:56:46,953
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's a lot of interstate activity.

558
00:56:47,613 --> 00:56:59,696
[SPEAKER_09]: As it happens, the people working for Maura Healey, and this doesn't happen all the time in state government, did not happen necessarily in the early years of the Baker administration, but it's happening now.

559
00:57:00,837 --> 00:57:09,419
[SPEAKER_09]: All the people around Healey who are doing this stuff know all their colleagues in other states because Healey, of course, was an attorney general.

560
00:57:09,879 --> 00:57:12,800
[SPEAKER_09]: She had a very large energy and environment

561
00:57:14,014 --> 00:57:32,241
[SPEAKER_09]: division, and the people who are heading up policy for her as governor, been working on these ideas for years with their colleagues in other places, because there have been a lot of New England, to your point, we have a New England wide grid, so the conversations are structured.

562
00:57:33,782 --> 00:57:42,505
[SPEAKER_09]: And similarly, there's now a lot of exchange with FERC and with ISO New England, with the feds, for a whole bunch of reasons, including just the recognition that

563
00:57:44,687 --> 00:57:47,389
[SPEAKER_09]: state and federal stuff are intermeshed.

564
00:57:47,449 --> 00:57:52,472
[SPEAKER_09]: And just to give you one example of how they're interrelated, but there are dozens, of course, you could cite.

565
00:57:53,433 --> 00:58:00,037
[SPEAKER_09]: A transmission line of a certain capacity is actually regulated by the federal government, especially if it crosses state lines.

566
00:58:02,318 --> 00:58:10,123
[SPEAKER_09]: More local lines, the sort running through the city, are distribution lines and are managed entirely by state government.

567
00:58:11,105 --> 00:58:15,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously, there's a continuum between the interstate grid and the local one.

568
00:58:16,187 --> 00:58:18,789
[SPEAKER_09]: And so there have always been conversations.

569
00:58:18,829 --> 00:58:31,754
[SPEAKER_09]: But the people running the New England network, the New England network of wires, have really, especially with Trump's first term, ISO New England pivoted.

570
00:58:32,495 --> 00:58:39,338
[SPEAKER_09]: They realized that a lot of action was going to have to take place at the state level, because for a while, federal action was going to be bollocked up.

571
00:58:40,664 --> 00:58:49,812
[SPEAKER_09]: there was a turn toward encouraging conversations between the managers of the New England system and the individual states, including people like me.

572
00:58:50,713 --> 00:58:55,937
[SPEAKER_09]: So conversations have been pretty robust, I'm pleased to say.

573
00:58:58,739 --> 00:58:59,000
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

574
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:00,081
[SPEAKER_08]: That's good to hear.

575
00:59:01,907 --> 00:59:05,129
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this is really interesting legislation.

576
00:59:05,169 --> 00:59:06,170
[SPEAKER_08]: I know other states too.

577
00:59:06,190 --> 00:59:15,437
[SPEAKER_08]: I think California and Kaiso and Texas as well have encouraged more distribution level generation being built.

578
00:59:15,497 --> 00:59:19,320
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think it's a great idea and a great way to get around some of the backlog.

579
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:20,741
[SPEAKER_08]: So really excited to hear this.

580
00:59:21,752 --> 00:59:22,472
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, thank you, Dan.

581
00:59:22,512 --> 00:59:23,293
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate that.

582
00:59:23,913 --> 00:59:32,016
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you guys think about the local government piece and the ways it can be harmonized with this expedited decision making we're striving for?

583
00:59:32,036 --> 00:59:40,499
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I ask a question?

584
00:59:41,402 --> 00:59:41,602
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

585
00:59:42,182 --> 00:59:42,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

586
00:59:42,342 --> 00:59:43,762
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Alicia.

587
00:59:43,782 --> 00:59:43,822
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.

588
00:59:44,303 --> 00:59:47,303
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I'm the director of planning sustainability.

589
00:59:47,343 --> 00:59:48,843
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I was late this evening.

590
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:50,764
[SPEAKER_00]: I find it interesting.

591
00:59:52,084 --> 00:59:59,106
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actively advising the board that is hearing several 40 B's in Medford.

592
00:59:59,926 --> 01:00:08,487
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the spin on it was that they don't have to follow Medford ordinances and laws.

593
01:00:09,208 --> 01:00:10,028
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is,

594
01:00:13,230 --> 01:00:14,331
[SPEAKER_00]: how they get around that.

595
01:00:15,932 --> 01:00:22,517
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they actually have to explicitly ask for a waiver for everything that they don't want to have to follow.

596
01:00:23,558 --> 01:00:28,159
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that the whole thing isn't a bad idea for solar.

597
01:00:28,179 --> 01:00:29,539
[SPEAKER_00]: I assume this is ground mount.

598
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:33,320
[SPEAKER_00]: Like obviously if it's on somebody's house, it's a totally different situation, right?

599
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:34,700
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's right.

600
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:36,140
[SPEAKER_09]: It won't apply to that.

601
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:37,861
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, if it's on a building.

602
01:00:38,241 --> 01:00:51,283
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think being very careful about how it's being framed is important and that comparing it to the 40B process in a lot of communities, that's a very negative process that says,

603
01:00:52,143 --> 01:00:58,749
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not following, we don't have to follow local laws.

604
01:00:59,749 --> 01:01:10,679
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're exempting ourselves from them, which just has a negative connotation, which in fact, they're actually asking for waivers and there's a board that's going to review all the waivers, et cetera.

605
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:14,041
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think some of it is the framing.

606
01:01:14,782 --> 01:01:20,186
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've also seen us drag those out for the full amount of the legal time.

607
01:01:21,027 --> 01:01:27,869
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd hate to see projects that would have gotten permitted faster somehow get caught up in that process.

608
01:01:28,269 --> 01:01:38,891
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just say that not because I disagree with the idea, but it's just something to watch for as you're moving forward and where you're talking about it, right?

609
01:01:38,991 --> 01:01:43,372
[SPEAKER_00]: In Medford, it's got this weird bad taste and we're not the only community.

610
01:01:44,356 --> 01:01:46,677
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's a very good point.

611
01:01:46,877 --> 01:01:52,938
[SPEAKER_09]: And by the way, the comprehensive permit isn't the only route that a project could take.

612
01:01:53,378 --> 01:02:08,862
[SPEAKER_09]: If the project developers engage with you all early and things look like they can be worked out amongst you all, then the developer needn't take the comprehensive permit route.

613
01:02:09,062 --> 01:02:12,823
[SPEAKER_09]: It could instead go through a regular sequence of local boards

614
01:02:13,668 --> 01:02:19,753
[SPEAKER_09]: And that of course would be preferable, I think, because there'd be more buy-in and a better feeling about.

615
01:02:21,535 --> 01:02:40,050
[SPEAKER_09]: However, as a working politician who represents eight communities in all, one city, Waltham and seven towns, I can tell you that some of the opposition to local infrastructure improvements has been virulent.

616
01:02:41,230 --> 01:02:56,976
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm thinking of a case in my district where the immediate abutters to an old abandoned railroad line that Eversource proposed to run a transmission line down the center.

617
01:02:57,016 --> 01:03:05,640
[SPEAKER_09]: In other words, it was going to be electric wires next to this abandoned railroad, overgrown ties.

618
01:03:06,881 --> 01:03:21,092
[SPEAKER_09]: And the immediate abutters, the backyards ran up against the railroad tracks, organized a townwide protect our environment group, extended the argument for eight years.

619
01:03:22,573 --> 01:03:26,035
[SPEAKER_09]: The rest of the town wasn't involved, but the abutter was determined.

620
01:03:26,055 --> 01:03:28,617
[SPEAKER_09]: He ran for the select board and was elected.

621
01:03:28,637 --> 01:03:31,480
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the equivalent of being elected really to the city council.

622
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:31,880
[SPEAKER_09]: He won.

623
01:03:33,023 --> 01:03:41,851
[SPEAKER_09]: And he protracted this litigation for eight years, even after Eversource agreed to bury the wires so that no one would ever see them.

624
01:03:42,171 --> 01:03:43,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Didn't matter to him at that point.

625
01:03:44,753 --> 01:03:52,900
[SPEAKER_09]: They lost at every turn, but it did take eight years, millions of dollars in legal fees on behalf of the town.

626
01:03:54,512 --> 01:04:00,377
[SPEAKER_09]: And in that case, Alicia, this guy was not interested in working things out.

627
01:04:00,957 --> 01:04:02,819
[SPEAKER_09]: He was trying to kill the project.

628
01:04:03,159 --> 01:04:10,965
[SPEAKER_09]: And he was an able political organizer who invoked every environmental consideration in the book in order to buttress his case.

629
01:04:11,225 --> 01:04:18,831
[SPEAKER_09]: In the end, those environmental considerations were found to be wanting and a little trumped up, but he had quite a ride.

630
01:04:19,772 --> 01:04:19,932
[SPEAKER_09]: So

631
01:04:22,518 --> 01:04:31,646
[SPEAKER_09]: There's the gamut in terms of, I would say that would be an example of almost outright nimbyism masquerading as environmental protection.

632
01:04:32,947 --> 01:04:37,491
[SPEAKER_09]: But on the other extreme, there are real cases where an environmental value is at stake.

633
01:04:39,172 --> 01:04:40,873
[SPEAKER_09]: And then there's a lot of things in between.

634
01:04:41,674 --> 01:04:43,596
[SPEAKER_09]: With regard to your other point, I'm torn.

635
01:04:43,676 --> 01:04:44,596
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll be candid with you.

636
01:04:46,158 --> 01:04:47,679
[SPEAKER_09]: It is a comprehensive permit.

637
01:04:48,653 --> 01:04:53,999
[SPEAKER_09]: comparable to, roughly analogous to 40B, but you're right, it's politically toxic to say so.

638
01:04:54,840 --> 01:05:02,107
[SPEAKER_09]: Tonight I chose to be honest, but I reserve the right to be dishonest in the future, depending on my mood.

639
01:05:02,647 --> 01:05:08,173
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just kidding a little bit, but I can appreciate that it's very volatile.

640
01:05:15,228 --> 01:05:19,230
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't have to be dishonesty, it can be equivocation.

641
01:05:19,890 --> 01:05:26,192
[SPEAKER_02]: You can say what it is, but not necessarily the negative aspects of it.

642
01:05:27,352 --> 01:05:33,194
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, how would you, actually, let me ask, I'm serious about this, because I'm actually struggling with this, all kidding aside.

643
01:05:33,675 --> 01:05:40,077
[SPEAKER_09]: How would you, to use Alicia's terminology, which is good terminology, how would you frame it in ways that was

644
01:05:40,965 --> 01:05:47,570
[SPEAKER_09]: that was descriptive enough so that people could grasp what would be going on, but still not a turnoff.

645
01:05:48,610 --> 01:05:54,054
[SPEAKER_02]: If I may, because it was immediately a turnoff to me, I have to admit.

646
01:05:56,596 --> 01:06:06,303
[SPEAKER_02]: But I appreciate the idea of streamlined process with appropriate feedback from the community,

647
01:06:07,275 --> 01:06:18,387
[SPEAKER_02]: appropriate opportunity for the local residents to have their say and bring up appropriate concerns.

648
01:06:19,188 --> 01:06:26,736
[SPEAKER_02]: And focusing on that, because that should certainly exist in this, whatever it is.

649
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:37,187
[SPEAKER_02]: That should be focused on, because everyone should know that they have the right to say, this is an issue for me.

650
01:06:37,787 --> 01:06:48,078
[SPEAKER_02]: For whatever reason they think that may be an issue, and maybe those issues are valid, and maybe they're more just nimbyism, but at least they could be voiced, and then it could be determined

651
01:06:48,678 --> 01:06:56,264
[SPEAKER_02]: whether this is a valid concern or, you know, is this project actually not a good idea and shouldn't be in your backyard?

652
01:06:56,404 --> 01:06:58,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is this project really something that needs to happen?

653
01:07:01,067 --> 01:07:07,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Or can it be made better so that it is not impacting our community in a negative way?

654
01:07:08,313 --> 01:07:08,893
[SPEAKER_09]: Nicely put.

655
01:07:08,953 --> 01:07:09,474
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Luke.

656
01:07:09,534 --> 01:07:10,995
[SPEAKER_09]: That's actually, that's helpful.

657
01:07:11,535 --> 01:07:14,521
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I agree with what Luke just said.

658
01:07:14,581 --> 01:07:22,055
[SPEAKER_12]: And I also think, you know, borrowing a page from the right wing playbook to use the term cutting red tape.

659
01:07:25,562 --> 01:07:30,906
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, is that so you're saying that that's a bad thing?

660
01:07:31,066 --> 01:07:32,667
[SPEAKER_12]: That's it.

661
01:07:32,707 --> 01:07:34,728
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's cut some red tape for the right.

662
01:07:34,928 --> 01:07:37,810
[SPEAKER_09]: And we should be able to use it to cut the road.

663
01:07:37,910 --> 01:07:38,290
[SPEAKER_09]: I got you.

664
01:07:38,310 --> 01:07:38,671
[SPEAKER_09]: I got it.

665
01:07:38,771 --> 01:07:38,991
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

666
01:07:39,011 --> 01:07:39,571
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

667
01:07:39,951 --> 01:07:40,332
[SPEAKER_09]: I see.

668
01:07:40,372 --> 01:07:41,392
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not pro red tape.

669
01:07:41,432 --> 01:07:41,592
[SPEAKER_09]: Now.

670
01:07:41,612 --> 01:07:42,533
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand your business.

671
01:07:42,573 --> 01:07:43,113
[SPEAKER_09]: You're anti.

672
01:07:43,634 --> 01:07:43,994
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

673
01:07:45,375 --> 01:07:45,695
[SPEAKER_09]: I gotcha.

674
01:07:47,843 --> 01:07:53,524
[SPEAKER_00]: If I might add, I'll just say that the term comprehensive permit is not toxic.

675
01:07:53,624 --> 01:07:59,045
[SPEAKER_00]: It's when you say just like a 40B, that's when people's tackles rise.

676
01:07:59,105 --> 01:08:02,826
[SPEAKER_00]: A comprehensive permit sounds like a good idea, right?

677
01:08:03,126 --> 01:08:09,347
[SPEAKER_00]: Just don't compare it to 40B housing, especially not any, yeah, people don't like it.

678
01:08:09,387 --> 01:08:11,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no need to say it.

679
01:08:13,088 --> 01:08:14,709
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, good to hear.

680
01:08:14,809 --> 01:08:16,469
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, this is very helpful.

681
01:08:19,072 --> 01:08:22,493
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you guys think about, oh, I'm sorry, go on.

682
01:08:22,853 --> 01:08:26,375
[SPEAKER_01]: I would agree that 40Bs are absolutely hated.

683
01:08:29,436 --> 01:08:39,040
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are also used as a threat to, in other words, you better work pretty hard on negotiating this project.

684
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:46,362
[SPEAKER_01]: Because at the end of the day, if we don't get what we want, we can always file for a 40B and get everything we want.

685
01:08:48,589 --> 01:08:54,173
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think a lot of it is in your initial planning, if you're sensitive to.

686
01:08:54,293 --> 01:08:58,936
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like if you have to put a new highway or widen a highway.

687
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:10,605
[SPEAKER_01]: These days, not in the Eisenhower era, but today, you have to consider who you're impacting.

688
01:09:11,970 --> 01:09:13,250
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to run that.

689
01:09:13,450 --> 01:09:23,413
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like you tried to run that transmission line on a right-of-way that was not on somebody's property or impacting a park or something.

690
01:09:24,074 --> 01:09:31,776
[SPEAKER_01]: But generally speaking, it needs to be thought through to minimize the impact before you even get

691
01:09:32,671 --> 01:09:38,873
[SPEAKER_01]: to the point of telling the community, this is infrastructure's plan for your community.

692
01:09:39,314 --> 01:09:41,775
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's a terribly difficult thing.

693
01:09:41,855 --> 01:09:58,301
[SPEAKER_01]: I have family members who live in the Greenfield, Northfield area who fight like hell against any wind farms, pipeline, anything, infrastructure that goes through the area.

694
01:09:58,541 --> 01:10:00,582
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have some legitimate concerns.

695
01:10:02,773 --> 01:10:04,674
[SPEAKER_01]: and some not so legitimate concerns.

696
01:10:05,595 --> 01:10:06,796
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wish you well with this.

697
01:10:07,797 --> 01:10:08,177
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

698
01:10:09,718 --> 01:10:10,699
[SPEAKER_11]: I would say the same thing.

699
01:10:10,739 --> 01:10:14,061
[SPEAKER_11]: I think these are really difficult issues to balance.

700
01:10:14,722 --> 01:10:21,787
[SPEAKER_11]: And sounds like you've got them in mind and you're doing the best you can with really, really tough issues.

701
01:10:22,227 --> 01:10:23,008
[SPEAKER_11]: So I appreciate it.

702
01:10:24,148 --> 01:10:24,749
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks, Frank.

703
01:10:26,490 --> 01:10:29,872
[SPEAKER_11]: Benji, my wife's name is on the... Oh, I see.

704
01:10:29,973 --> 01:10:30,393
[SPEAKER_09]: What's your name?

705
01:10:30,413 --> 01:10:30,513
[SPEAKER_09]: Benji.

706
01:10:37,692 --> 01:10:43,563
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll close by saying that there are a couple of other things that I hope will enter into this omnibus climate bill that

707
01:10:44,322 --> 01:10:45,223
[SPEAKER_09]: we haven't talked about.

708
01:10:45,483 --> 01:10:54,067
[SPEAKER_09]: To mention them very briefly, I favor a ban on the sales by so-called competitive suppliers to individuals.

709
01:10:54,868 --> 01:11:02,012
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if any of you are aware of that issue, but it's one thing for these big companies to negotiate with Medford on municipal aggregation.

710
01:11:02,052 --> 01:11:10,997
[SPEAKER_09]: It's another thing for them to run young people through a training program and then send them door to door offering

711
01:11:12,152 --> 01:11:15,736
[SPEAKER_09]: teaser fees at the beginning that wind up being balloon payments at the end.

712
01:11:15,756 --> 01:11:19,640
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you agree with me, Barry, on that?

713
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:20,902
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

714
01:11:21,683 --> 01:11:29,812
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been on that issue since before deregulation happened, because we knew that that was going to be the result.

715
01:11:31,894 --> 01:11:32,014
[SPEAKER_12]: And

716
01:11:33,998 --> 01:11:35,959
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I mean, it's it's a rip off.

717
01:11:36,039 --> 01:11:37,400
[SPEAKER_12]: It's full of greenwashing.

718
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:39,481
[SPEAKER_12]: It's full of financial scams.

719
01:11:39,702 --> 01:11:42,584
[SPEAKER_12]: It's it's awful practices.

720
01:11:42,904 --> 01:11:46,706
[SPEAKER_12]: And yes, please put a stop.

721
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:59,675
[SPEAKER_07]: We just had somebody come into our office last week who had been unknowingly put on to a competitive supplier that was six cents higher than our aggregation.

722
01:12:00,676 --> 01:12:00,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Well,

723
01:12:02,946 --> 01:12:11,732
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you keep competitive, would you still keep like, you know, competitive supply, but what would the bill do?

724
01:12:12,192 --> 01:12:17,435
[SPEAKER_08]: And I say that coming from like a place where I completely agree with the premise.

725
01:12:17,475 --> 01:12:29,583
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's, the retail industry is scammy and horrible, but how would people be able to choose a supplier under what you're imagining?

726
01:12:30,004 --> 01:12:30,724
[SPEAKER_09]: Good question.

727
01:12:30,824 --> 01:12:31,965
[SPEAKER_09]: Municipal aggregation,

728
01:12:32,773 --> 01:12:38,276
[SPEAKER_09]: would be the primary alternative in a city like Medford.

729
01:12:38,876 --> 01:12:45,700
[SPEAKER_09]: And municipal aggregation doesn't exist everywhere in Massachusetts, but it exists in places representing about 70% of the population.

730
01:12:47,641 --> 01:12:59,067
[SPEAKER_09]: The so-called basic service alternative offered to you and to your neighbors by Eversource or National Grid, whoever your electricity supplier is, could be better

731
01:12:59,888 --> 01:13:10,157
[SPEAKER_09]: But interestingly, in 1999 or so, when we deregulated and Barry was thinking back to those days, we actually hobbled Eversource and National Grid.

732
01:13:10,638 --> 01:13:19,406
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone, including the utilities themselves, thought that competitive suppliers were going to take over the market because there would, well, be competition.

733
01:13:20,054 --> 01:13:30,156
[SPEAKER_09]: They imagined, even the reformers imagined, most of them, Barry was more prescient than most, that the deals offered would be better deals than whatever source or national grid would offer you.

734
01:13:31,437 --> 01:13:36,278
[SPEAKER_09]: So as a consequence, they actually constrained the utilities.

735
01:13:36,998 --> 01:13:45,500
[SPEAKER_09]: Now we're in a situation where we need the utilities to be able to offer a product competitive with the so-called competitive suppliers, but it can't.

736
01:13:46,620 --> 01:13:47,300
[SPEAKER_09]: Why can't it?

737
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:54,704
[SPEAKER_09]: because the competitive suppliers can take a look at the inflationary spike, for example, that happened this year and say, you know what?

738
01:13:55,324 --> 01:13:56,825
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was running up last year.

739
01:13:57,165 --> 01:14:00,327
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to negotiate a two-year contract for electricity.

740
01:14:00,647 --> 01:14:04,129
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to try to jump over this period where electric rates are high.

741
01:14:04,949 --> 01:14:07,931
[SPEAKER_09]: That's if they could have anticipated the supply chain disruptions.

742
01:14:08,531 --> 01:14:09,672
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're going to negotiate.

743
01:14:10,272 --> 01:14:12,313
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like negotiating a mortgage.

744
01:14:13,093 --> 01:14:14,054
[SPEAKER_09]: Rates are still low.

745
01:14:14,114 --> 01:14:15,935
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to negotiate our deal now.

746
01:14:16,757 --> 01:14:23,939
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to extend for two years, will protect our people from inflation, and then ideally inflation will have subsided by the time we have to renew.

747
01:14:24,459 --> 01:14:25,940
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what competitive suppliers can do.

748
01:14:25,980 --> 01:14:29,421
[SPEAKER_09]: They can go short or long, depending on their reading of market conditions.

749
01:14:29,481 --> 01:14:34,642
[SPEAKER_09]: But Eversource, is Eversource the electric supplier for Medford National Grid?

750
01:14:35,910 --> 01:14:53,199
[SPEAKER_09]: We passed a law that says national grid, you can only negotiate six-month deals with the same suppliers, because the generators, electricity, whether they sell to the brokers who call themselves, by the way, a supplier is not a generator, the supplier is a middleman.

751
01:14:54,279 --> 01:14:59,022
[SPEAKER_09]: So the generators sell to these middle guys who are brokers reselling to you,

752
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:06,902
[SPEAKER_09]: They're also selling to municipal aggregators, but the municipal aggregators can hire enough staff to figure out good deals.

753
01:15:07,722 --> 01:15:09,942
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're actually selling to Eversource too.

754
01:15:10,362 --> 01:15:21,185
[SPEAKER_09]: Eversource can only contract with them for six months, whereas Medford, through its deals, can buy long to protect its people and to keep prices stable.

755
01:15:21,225 --> 01:15:23,986
[SPEAKER_09]: So part of the climate bill will rescind

756
01:15:25,024 --> 01:15:29,206
[SPEAKER_09]: the requirement that National Grid can only contract for six months at a time.

757
01:15:29,266 --> 01:15:39,152
[SPEAKER_09]: We'd like National Grid to operate under the same market conditions as Constellation Energy, which sells to Medford, but also sells to individuals door to door.

758
01:15:40,753 --> 01:15:42,714
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just like the right to gas.

759
01:15:43,454 --> 01:15:47,857
[SPEAKER_09]: There are these weird anomalies in state laws which have market distorting effects.

760
01:15:48,897 --> 01:15:53,640
[SPEAKER_09]: So anyway, the long and the short of it is the House right now is going to

761
01:15:54,537 --> 01:15:59,939
[SPEAKER_09]: opt to reform the competitive suppliers, which we've been trying to do for 25 years.

762
01:16:00,499 --> 01:16:02,639
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's time to call an end to the process.

763
01:16:02,699 --> 01:16:03,740
[SPEAKER_09]: So does the governor.

764
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:06,400
[SPEAKER_09]: So does the Attorney General Campbell.

765
01:16:06,781 --> 01:16:10,742
[SPEAKER_09]: We all agree that it's time to call the 25 year experiment to an end.

766
01:16:11,402 --> 01:16:15,483
[SPEAKER_09]: What we would keep in its place is municipal aggregation to the same company.

767
01:16:15,503 --> 01:16:17,264
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're not putting any companies out of business.

768
01:16:18,164 --> 01:16:18,264
[SPEAKER_09]: And

769
01:16:19,486 --> 01:16:28,273
[SPEAKER_09]: a renewed basic service, but with Eversource and National Grid as free to maneuver in the marketplace as the rest of the market players are.

770
01:16:29,414 --> 01:16:32,236
[SPEAKER_09]: So in any event, here's another piece.

771
01:16:32,837 --> 01:16:45,186
[SPEAKER_09]: Elon Musk last week, as you may know, laid off his entire EV charger division, top to bottom, the head of the division right down to the sales force.

772
01:16:45,707 --> 01:16:48,289
[SPEAKER_09]: In one fell swoop, he had decimated

773
01:16:49,990 --> 01:16:54,732
[SPEAKER_09]: the part of Tesla that has to do with addressing charger anxiety.

774
01:16:56,793 --> 01:17:01,156
[SPEAKER_09]: That has thrown or will throw the EV charging market into turmoil.

775
01:17:01,276 --> 01:17:14,682
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would like a climate bill to address all kinds of issues that have to do with getting that charger infrastructure in place, despite Tesla's erratic or Musk's erratic behavior.

776
01:17:15,183 --> 01:17:19,505
[SPEAKER_09]: And to give you an example of how it could touch Medford, as you guys probably know,

777
01:17:20,233 --> 01:17:30,195
[SPEAKER_09]: the city of Melrose next to you, has pioneered in right-of-way charging, essentially curbside chargers that are suspended on street lights.

778
01:17:31,015 --> 01:17:41,717
[SPEAKER_09]: And once you work an app on your phone to send to ground level, enable you to charge your car parked at a regular parking space in Medford next to a meter.

779
01:17:42,597 --> 01:17:45,058
[SPEAKER_09]: And then at the end of the charging experience,

780
01:17:47,047 --> 01:17:50,749
[SPEAKER_09]: the device goes back up the pole so it's protected from vandals.

781
01:17:51,429 --> 01:17:58,073
[SPEAKER_09]: So right of way or curbside charging is something that state law can facilitate.

782
01:17:59,474 --> 01:18:14,442
[SPEAKER_09]: And there are a half dozen measures like that that I'd like to see included in the climate bill, because the idea is to stabilize and continue the deployment of charging infrastructure, even in the face, as I say, of Tesla's

783
01:18:15,684 --> 01:18:16,925
[SPEAKER_09]: unpredictable behavior.

784
01:18:19,125 --> 01:18:35,892
[SPEAKER_09]: My hope, and then finally, for those of you interested in waste reduction, I hope that a 2024 climate bill includes an enhanced model bill that covers many more containers and pops the deposit available from a nickel to a dime.

785
01:18:35,912 --> 01:18:37,973
[SPEAKER_09]: You probably have curbside collection in Medford.

786
01:18:38,554 --> 01:18:40,234
[SPEAKER_09]: They do in Lexington as well.

787
01:18:40,775 --> 01:18:44,056
[SPEAKER_09]: But we also have folks who go, who turn,

788
01:18:44,907 --> 01:18:47,329
[SPEAKER_09]: bottles back for the nickel deposit.

789
01:18:47,770 --> 01:18:48,310
[SPEAKER_09]: Good for you.

790
01:18:48,590 --> 01:19:00,240
[SPEAKER_09]: And we'd like to double the deposit and expand the universe of containers because we want to see single-use plastics reduced.

791
01:19:02,122 --> 01:19:07,727
[SPEAKER_09]: So you begin to understand that this is a complicated

792
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:11,521
[SPEAKER_09]: multifaceted piece of legislation, potentially.

793
01:19:11,982 --> 01:19:13,902
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the Senate will do everything I've just said.

794
01:19:14,223 --> 01:19:15,423
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't vouch for the House.

795
01:19:17,104 --> 01:19:25,908
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's why there's a conference committee where I will have to negotiate with my opposite member in the House, and we'll try to secure as many of these reforms as we can.

796
01:19:27,648 --> 01:19:31,530
[SPEAKER_12]: Senator, that all sounds fantastic.

797
01:19:31,750 --> 01:19:38,053
[SPEAKER_12]: I would like to back up to the previous issue for just a second and say

798
01:19:40,379 --> 01:19:47,243
[SPEAKER_12]: fine tune the idea of giving the electric utilities a free hand.

799
01:19:49,024 --> 01:19:54,827
[SPEAKER_12]: As much as I despise the competitive marketers, I don't really trust the electric utilities either.

800
01:19:55,567 --> 01:19:57,649
[SPEAKER_12]: And I wouldn't want to give them a free hand.

801
01:19:57,709 --> 01:20:03,392
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd want to give them a requirement to obtain the best deal that they can for consumers.

802
01:20:05,247 --> 01:20:10,311
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, here's a weird thing about this market.

803
01:20:10,832 --> 01:20:14,615
[SPEAKER_09]: The utilities make no money on supply.

804
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:20,840
[SPEAKER_09]: The way we wrote the law, and this is good, they make their money on construction projects.

805
01:20:21,642 --> 01:20:35,371
[SPEAKER_09]: So the reason that siting and permitting gets even trickier than we've discussed thus far, and we don't have to get into it anymore, is because they make all their money, they get a statutory rate of return, it's about 9.75% on construction only.

806
01:20:36,432 --> 01:20:39,354
[SPEAKER_09]: So they have every incentive to build more transmission.

807
01:20:40,474 --> 01:20:43,997
[SPEAKER_09]: They have no incentive to gouge you on supply,

808
01:20:45,180 --> 01:20:54,744
[SPEAKER_09]: In a deregulated market, the supply is actually generated New England wide by a bunch of no-name outfits owned by private equity companies these days.

809
01:20:55,284 --> 01:20:57,745
[SPEAKER_09]: You've never heard of these companies.

810
01:20:59,166 --> 01:21:05,688
[SPEAKER_09]: And in any event, their ownership involves layers of ownership.

811
01:21:05,708 --> 01:21:12,391
[SPEAKER_09]: And the utilities make no money because they're not legally permitted to mark up what they pay for the electricity.

812
01:21:12,431 --> 01:21:14,672
[SPEAKER_09]: They pass it on to you at cost.

813
01:21:15,777 --> 01:21:27,606
[SPEAKER_09]: If they don't give you a good deal, if they are lousy at negotiating with these no-name generators, they make no extra money, but they piss you off.

814
01:21:28,186 --> 01:21:34,591
[SPEAKER_09]: And they actually then create adverse circumstances to their making more money on construction.

815
01:21:34,951 --> 01:21:44,718
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're motivated to keep the supply costs down so that the only thing that's going up is distribution, which is where they do make their money.

816
01:21:46,294 --> 01:21:53,720
[SPEAKER_09]: Their interests are relatively aligned with the consumer's interest on the supply side, though not on the generation side.

817
01:21:53,740 --> 01:21:56,603
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why the DPU regulates generation.

818
01:21:57,364 --> 01:22:00,106
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's why I'm concerned about the siting and permitting thing.

819
01:22:00,146 --> 01:22:01,668
[SPEAKER_09]: We haven't discussed these other issues.

820
01:22:01,988 --> 01:22:03,670
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to make sure there's no overbuilding.

821
01:22:06,292 --> 01:22:10,496
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm not worried about the supply piece because that's not a profit center for them.

822
01:22:11,155 --> 01:22:16,398
[SPEAKER_09]: And if we, I don't want to give them, I don't want to advantage them relative to the so-called competitive suppliers.

823
01:22:16,798 --> 01:22:36,888
[SPEAKER_09]: I want them to play though on exactly a level playing field because their ability to procure supply is as good as the brokers who currently deal with the generators and negotiate with you on municipal aggregation.

824
01:22:38,065 --> 01:22:42,049
[SPEAKER_09]: Those brokers have expert economists to figure out where the market is.

825
01:22:42,970 --> 01:22:46,373
[SPEAKER_09]: Every source of national grid have the capacity to staff up too.

826
01:22:47,214 --> 01:22:57,225
[SPEAKER_09]: And we haven't seen any instance where they've settled for an inflated price just because they're lazy and don't care on the supply side.

827
01:22:57,625 --> 01:23:00,268
[SPEAKER_09]: The incentives seem to be relatively robust.

828
01:23:07,835 --> 01:23:11,576
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, listen, I want to thank you guys for helping me out here.

829
01:23:11,776 --> 01:23:15,797
[SPEAKER_09]: I really do appreciate the advice on semantics.

830
01:23:16,017 --> 01:23:18,958
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm a big fan of Medford.

831
01:23:19,058 --> 01:23:23,239
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got two grown daughters who are living in Medford.

832
01:23:23,419 --> 01:23:25,580
[SPEAKER_09]: One of them just bought a house in Malden.

833
01:23:26,220 --> 01:23:27,200
[SPEAKER_09]: You're too expensive.

834
01:23:28,261 --> 01:23:29,321
[SPEAKER_09]: You're too expensive.

835
01:23:29,341 --> 01:23:30,361
[SPEAKER_09]: You're too pricey.

836
01:23:30,381 --> 01:23:31,281
[SPEAKER_09]: So she went over.

837
01:23:31,321 --> 01:23:32,642
[SPEAKER_09]: She defaulted to Malden.

838
01:23:33,102 --> 01:23:35,583
[SPEAKER_09]: But we all love Medford.

839
01:23:38,687 --> 01:23:41,069
[SPEAKER_09]: I really appreciate the feedback that you've given me.

840
01:23:42,710 --> 01:23:43,090
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

841
01:23:43,170 --> 01:23:43,951
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep up your good work.

842
01:23:45,972 --> 01:23:46,332
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

843
01:23:46,432 --> 01:23:47,273
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, guys.

844
01:23:48,153 --> 01:23:48,854
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye-bye.

845
01:23:48,874 --> 01:23:52,456
[SPEAKER_00]: We really appreciate you taking the time to come and meet with the committee.

846
01:23:53,677 --> 01:23:55,078
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, this was very enjoyable.

847
01:23:55,098 --> 01:23:56,159
[SPEAKER_09]: It was good to meet you all.

848
01:23:56,659 --> 01:24:00,261
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, remember, talk to Pat Jalen, who's already on the right side.

849
01:24:00,341 --> 01:24:05,925
[SPEAKER_09]: Talk to your reps and have them talk to Jeff Roy about ending

850
01:24:07,197 --> 01:24:17,701
[SPEAKER_09]: about barring competitive suppliers just from selling face to face to consumers who can't hope to match the information firepower the competitive suppliers can muster.

851
01:24:18,702 --> 01:24:28,446
[SPEAKER_09]: The competitive suppliers will stay in business, but they'll sell to the city, which can now be a fair fight and a fair negotiation, but not to individuals in poor neighborhoods.

852
01:24:29,046 --> 01:24:33,008
[SPEAKER_09]: So I hope we can get a little support going in the House for ending

853
01:24:34,276 --> 01:24:39,077
[SPEAKER_09]: face-to-face individual sales by these competitive suppliers.

854
01:24:39,557 --> 01:24:40,317
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

855
01:24:41,317 --> 01:24:41,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

856
01:24:48,479 --> 01:24:49,039
[SPEAKER_03]: All righty.

857
01:24:49,059 --> 01:24:51,900
[SPEAKER_03]: That was great.

858
01:24:52,940 --> 01:24:54,220
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm looking over our agenda.

859
01:24:54,900 --> 01:24:58,521
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to make sure we leave room for any new business people want to bring up.

860
01:25:00,121 --> 01:25:03,482
[SPEAKER_03]: But we are nearing the end of our session tonight.

861
01:25:06,122 --> 01:25:07,783
[SPEAKER_10]: God, we are so lucky to have him.

862
01:25:10,384 --> 01:25:20,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I want to give a special thank you to Bob for setting that up at first, getting the ball rolling on all that was really essential, really incredible.

863
01:25:24,536 --> 01:25:29,697
[SPEAKER_07]: So there were a couple other things that I that I wanted to mention just for updates.

864
01:25:30,457 --> 01:25:46,661
[SPEAKER_07]: The city, the Climate Equity Council meeting on the 22nd, we had Emma Twombly from the communications team with the city come and speak to them about methods that the city uses for outreach and.

865
01:25:49,697 --> 01:25:55,622
[SPEAKER_07]: If that's something that is useful to this group, I can send along sort of the list of things that she talked about.

866
01:25:56,383 --> 01:25:59,886
[SPEAKER_07]: And she asked for at least a two-week warning to push events out.

867
01:26:03,970 --> 01:26:14,500
[SPEAKER_07]: And I also wanted to mention there was the state received a solar for all grant.

868
01:26:16,141 --> 01:26:22,545
[SPEAKER_07]: That's that's going to be a pretty huge program, actually, and the funding for that was is likely to start this fall.

869
01:26:23,146 --> 01:26:29,350
[SPEAKER_07]: But I know that there are some people on this committee who are really interested in, you know, trying to start up community solar projects.

870
01:26:29,430 --> 01:26:34,174
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I think that's going to be a great way for funding for those to come through.

871
01:26:45,114 --> 01:26:46,155
[SPEAKER_06]: That was it for my updates.

872
01:26:53,039 --> 01:26:58,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think sending along the Climate Equity Council information is always appreciated.

873
01:27:02,445 --> 01:27:07,448
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that, any other new business people would like to introduce before we wrap?

874
01:27:13,940 --> 01:27:17,582
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, seeing none, I would entertain a motion to adjourn.

875
01:27:21,784 --> 01:27:22,365
[SPEAKER_10]: So moved.

876
01:27:26,807 --> 01:27:27,227
[SPEAKER_10]: Second.

877
01:27:28,268 --> 01:27:28,648
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

878
01:27:31,570 --> 01:27:32,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

879
01:27:32,630 --> 01:27:32,850
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

880
01:27:33,031 --> 01:27:33,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

881
01:27:33,351 --> 01:27:34,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Great job, everybody.

882
01:27:34,271 --> 01:27:35,432
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a great meeting.
