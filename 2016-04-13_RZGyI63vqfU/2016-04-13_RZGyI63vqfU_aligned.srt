00:00:09,875 --> 00:00:11,376
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

00:00:11,536 --> 00:00:12,536

00:00:15,578 --> 00:00:16,318

00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:19,239

Councilor Scarpelli?

15
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:21,360
Present.

16
00:00:21,941 --> 00:00:23,061
President Del Rosso?

17
00:00:23,101 --> 00:00:23,481

With seven members present and none absent, please rise and join us in saluting the flag.

19
00:00:29,024 --> 00:00:29,264
Aye.

20
00:00:37,502 --> 00:00:44,083
Mr. Messenger, would you please secure the area inside the precincts here, please?

21
00:00:46,063 --> 00:00:53,305
Chair recognizes Councilor Nye for suspension of the rules to take the applicants for board members on the motion of Councilor Nye for suspension of the rules.

22
00:00:53,365 --> 00:00:54,085
All those in favor?

23
00:00:54,425 --> 00:00:55,245
All those opposed?

24
00:00:55,965 --> 00:00:56,785
Motion passes.

25
00:00:58,265 --> 00:00:59,546
Communications from the Mayor, 16-384.

26
00:01:01,681 --> 00:01:16,631
To the Honorable President and members of the Memphis City Council, dear President and Councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable body confirm the appointment of Mr. Dean Bruno of 41 Saunders Street Method as a member of the License Commission.

27
00:01:17,111 --> 00:01:22,354
This position became vacant with the resignation of Mr. Maurice Del Vendo.

28
00:01:22,434 --> 00:01:27,838
Mr. Bruno's resume is attached and he plans to be present tonight at your meeting, Councilor Knight.

29
00:01:28,665 --> 00:01:30,046
Mr. President, thank you very much.

30
00:01:30,086 --> 00:01:34,047
It's with great pleasure that I'm here this evening to endorse Dean Bruno and his candidacy.

31
00:01:34,107 --> 00:01:35,648
I've known the Brunos for a number of years.

32
00:01:35,688 --> 00:01:39,870
They're a long time Medford family, grew up in West Medford and Dean now resides up in the Heights.

33
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:46,872
He has over a 20 year career in law enforcement and prior to that he had worked in government for about five years, Mr. President.

34
00:01:46,892 --> 00:01:49,774
So I have absolutely no problem with this appointment and I would move for approval.

35
00:01:50,414 --> 00:01:55,396
On the motion approved by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco.

36
00:01:57,348 --> 00:01:59,129
On the motion for approval, all those in favor?

37
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:00,410
All those opposed?

38
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,531
Motion carries.

39
00:02:02,551 --> 00:02:03,692
16- Congratulations.

40
00:02:04,973 --> 00:02:07,354
We're very glad to have you serving your community.

41
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:24,205
On the 16-385, to the Honorable President and members of the Memphis City Council, to Mr. President and councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable body confirm the appointment of Mr. Nabin Sapkota of 53 Earl Street, Earl Ave, Memphis,

42
00:02:26,175 --> 00:02:32,218
As Commissioner of Trust Funds, this position became vacant with the passing of Juan Ramirez.

43
00:02:32,798 --> 00:02:34,119
Is Mr. Stepcorder here, please?

44
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:35,500
You are welcome.

45
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,421
Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

46
00:02:38,021 --> 00:02:45,485
Mr. President, although I don't know the gentleman personally, I have reviewed his resume and it's rather impressive, and I'd ask that the committee move for approval.

47
00:02:46,825 --> 00:02:48,666
On the motion for approval, Councilor Knight.

48
00:02:48,686 --> 00:02:49,567
Second?

49
00:02:49,587 --> 00:02:51,708
Second, Mr. President.

50
00:02:51,728 --> 00:02:53,429
By Councilor Caviello on that motion.

51
00:02:53,449 --> 00:02:54,269
All those in favor?

52
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:55,810
All those opposed?

53
00:02:56,394 --> 00:02:56,954
Motion carries.

54
00:02:56,994 --> 00:02:58,195
Congratulations and welcome.

55
00:02:58,515 --> 00:02:59,375
We're glad to have you.

56
00:03:00,056 --> 00:03:00,476
Thank you.

57
00:03:01,796 --> 00:03:13,881
On the motion of Councilor Knight to take from unfinished business number 15-734, loan order addition to the DPW facility project fund of $300,000.

58
00:03:14,662 --> 00:03:24,906
This motion began its journey with us on November 10th in 2015 after being tabled and referred to committee a number of times.

59
00:03:25,758 --> 00:03:36,403
It finally passed its first reading this past March, second reading on March 31st, and now is eligible for a third and final reading on today, April 12th.

60
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:38,064
So the chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

61
00:03:38,684 --> 00:03:40,165
Mr. President, yes, thank you very much.

62
00:03:40,705 --> 00:03:44,047
As noted, this matter has been before the council a couple of occasions prior.

63
00:03:44,787 --> 00:03:50,189
It's relative to some surveying problems that were had with the Winthrop Street drainage project.

64
00:03:50,389 --> 00:03:51,410
It's my understanding that

65
00:03:51,889 --> 00:03:54,710
There is litigation subrogation that's in place relatively.

66
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:55,470
Am I looking at the right one?

67
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:56,611
No, I'm not looking at the right one.

68
00:03:56,631 --> 00:03:56,611
15734.

69
00:03:58,051 --> 00:04:00,112
This is the DPW facility.

70
00:04:00,152 --> 00:04:01,532
This is the DPW facility.

71
00:04:02,392 --> 00:04:04,133
We just had to tie the up.

72
00:04:04,153 --> 00:04:05,634
There was an underestimate on some.

73
00:04:05,794 --> 00:04:06,614
It was underestimated.

74
00:04:06,694 --> 00:04:09,575
It was underestimated on the mitigation for the pollution underground, Mr. President.

75
00:04:09,635 --> 00:04:10,235
Yes, yes.

76
00:04:11,035 --> 00:04:13,236
And we've passed a couple of readings on this.

77
00:04:13,256 --> 00:04:14,677
And I would move for approval on the third reading.

78
00:04:14,717 --> 00:04:16,337
It has to get paid one way or the other, Mr. President.

79
00:04:16,357 --> 00:04:17,417
Very good.

80
00:04:17,437 --> 00:04:19,078
So a motion for approval by Councilor Knight.

81
00:04:19,514 --> 00:04:20,855
Seconded by Councilor Falco.

82
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,056
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

83
00:04:22,616 --> 00:04:23,356
Councilor Marks.

84
00:04:25,357 --> 00:04:26,338
Thank you, Mr. President.

85
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:46,830
This is the issue that I've had concern with for a number of months now regarding the original estimate that the city hired an outside consultant to come in and give us an estimate on the contaminants at the DPW yard.

86
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:53,623
The estimate was off by, I believe it was 500,000.

87
00:04:54,283 --> 00:04:59,924
The estimate was off by 500,000, Mr. President.

88
00:05:00,744 --> 00:05:04,805
And I know we had many discussions with Louise.

89
00:05:04,825 --> 00:05:06,066
We have before us Ms.

90
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:11,427
Louise Miller, the Director of Budget and Finance, who can answer any of our questions.

91
00:05:11,827 --> 00:05:13,407
She's answered many of them.

92
00:05:13,467 --> 00:05:14,327
She's answered them all.

93
00:05:15,388 --> 00:05:17,008
I am in opposition of this paper.

94
00:05:17,421 --> 00:05:24,928
And I want to explain why, for the viewing audience, Mr. President, that I feel... If it's too comcastic tonight, it will be viewable.

95
00:05:25,508 --> 00:05:26,830
That's great.

96
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:32,775
And I want to explain my position, why I'm opposed to this, for the fact that...

97
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:45,509
The city went out and hired a consultant to come in and provide the city with facts and figures on what it would cost to remove the contaminants at the DPW yard.

98
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:53,435
And to be off by $500,000 on a project that was originally estimated at, what was the amount?

99
00:05:53,955 --> 00:05:54,656
It was just about $500,000.

100
00:05:54,696 --> 00:05:54,996
It was about $500,000.

101
00:05:55,036 --> 00:05:55,757
So they were off by $500,000.

102
00:05:55,857 --> 00:05:56,858
So the project ended up costing us

103
00:06:03,258 --> 00:06:04,880
A million dollars, Mr. President.

104
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:09,504
And I'm not sure, would we pay this outside consultant?

105
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:12,967
It was around $150,000.

106
00:06:13,167 --> 00:06:15,870
I don't have the exact figure.

107
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:23,116
So we paid $150,000 to an outside consultant to ask or to let us know what it was going to cost to remove the contaminants.

108
00:06:23,477 --> 00:06:23,817
They said $500,000.

109
00:06:25,202 --> 00:06:28,083
We started the project, it was closer to $1 million.

110
00:06:28,463 --> 00:06:35,707
So we lost $500,000 on that and we paid $150,000 for a consultant that gave us bogus information.

111
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:42,510
So it's actually $650,000 in net, which I have a real problem with that.

112
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:53,995
And I realize that the remedial treatment of what was under there may have differed based on what they found and so forth.

113
00:06:54,887 --> 00:06:56,328
I have a tough time thinking.

114
00:06:58,429 --> 00:07:00,049
It's almost like being a meteorologist.

115
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:04,831
You could be right 50% of the time, and you're doing a good job.

116
00:07:05,452 --> 00:07:11,934
And I don't understand why we'd pay a consultant to come in over $100,000 and be off by 100%.

117
00:07:12,595 --> 00:07:17,497
It just doesn't sound right to me, Mr. President.

118
00:07:17,577 --> 00:07:22,639
And for those particular reasons, I cannot support this particular funding.

119
00:07:23,524 --> 00:07:24,925
for the cleanup, Mr. President.

120
00:07:25,806 --> 00:07:27,608
Thank you, Councilor Marks, for your frankness.

121
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:34,516
So we have a motion for a pull by Councilor Knight, as seconded by Councilor Caviello.

122
00:07:35,077 --> 00:07:37,260
So on that motion, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

123
00:07:38,101 --> 00:07:38,902
Councilor Caviello?

124
00:07:38,922 --> 00:07:39,182
Yes.

125
00:07:39,202 --> 00:07:40,363
Councilor Falcone?

126
00:07:40,403 --> 00:07:40,644
Yes.

127
00:07:41,264 --> 00:07:42,065
Councilor Knight?

128
00:07:42,085 --> 00:07:42,165
Yes.

129
00:07:42,486 --> 00:07:43,347
Vice President

130
00:07:49,192 --> 00:07:54,822
Yes, with a six in the affirmative, one in the negative, the motion passes.

131
00:07:55,724 --> 00:07:56,486
Congratulations.

132
00:07:57,027 --> 00:07:57,387
Thank you.

133
00:07:57,788 --> 00:07:58,349
Thank you, Mr. President.

134
00:07:58,389 --> 00:07:59,211
None order passes.

135
00:07:59,767 --> 00:08:00,588
Thank you, Councillors.

136
00:08:00,848 --> 00:08:01,288
Thank you, Ms.

137
00:08:01,328 --> 00:08:01,608
Miller.

138
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:06,471
On the motion of Councillor Knight to take up item number 16-309.

139
00:08:07,331 --> 00:08:14,416
Again, an item eligible for third reading, amended ordinance on outdoor dining.

140
00:08:15,316 --> 00:08:18,358
After much consideration, we took this up at tonight.

141
00:08:18,778 --> 00:08:23,321
It is eligible for its third and final reading tonight, April 12th.

142
00:08:23,381 --> 00:08:25,702
So on the motion for approval by Councillor Knight.

143
00:08:28,624 --> 00:08:29,084
Councillor Knight.

144
00:08:29,432 --> 00:08:37,239
Yes, Mr. President, it's my understanding that this is just a simple clarification of the existing outdoor dining license ordinance that's in place.

145
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:45,766
There was some misinterpretation of the legislative intent that's been addressed through the language in this newly crafted zoning ordinance, and I move for approval.

146
00:08:46,586 --> 00:08:49,529
On the motion for approval, Councillor Marx.

147
00:08:50,589 --> 00:08:58,819
I just wanted to thank the subcommittee that was sent to Councilor Knight and under his leadership on that subcommittee.

148
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:04,645
They vetted this even further, the paper that we received from the administration.

149
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:08,249
And I wanted to thank that subcommittee for their due diligence on this.

150
00:09:09,871 --> 00:09:10,452
Thank you, Councilor.
