[SPEAKER_03]: To the Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council, dear President and Councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable body confirm the appointment of Mr. Dean Bruno of 41 Saunders Street Method as a member of the License Commission.

27
00:01:17,111 --> 00:01:22,354
[SPEAKER_03]: This position became vacant with the resignation of Mr. Maurice Del Vendo.

28
00:01:22,434 --> 00:01:27,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Bruno's resume is attached and he plans to be present tonight at your meeting, Councilor Knight.

29
00:01:28,665 --> 00:01:30,046
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

30
00:01:30,086 --> 00:01:34,047
[SPEAKER_01]: It's with great pleasure that I'm here this evening to endorse Dean Bruno and his candidacy.

31
00:01:34,107 --> 00:01:35,648
[SPEAKER_01]: I've known the Brunos for a number of years.

32
00:01:35,688 --> 00:01:39,870
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a long time Medford family, grew up in West Medford and Dean now resides up in the Heights.

33
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:46,872
[SPEAKER_01]: He has over a 20 year career in law enforcement and prior to that he had worked in government for about five years, Mr. President.

34
00:01:46,892 --> 00:01:49,774
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have absolutely no problem with this appointment and I would move for approval.

35
00:01:50,414 --> 00:01:55,396
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion approved by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco.

[SPEAKER_03]: 16- Congratulations.

40
00:02:04,973 --> 00:02:07,354
[SPEAKER_03]: We're very glad to have you serving your community.

41
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:24,205
[SPEAKER_03]: On the 16-385, to the Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council, to Mr. President and councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable body confirm the appointment of Mr. Nabin Sapkota of 53 Earl Street, Earl Ave, Medford,

42
00:02:26,175 --> 00:02:32,218
[SPEAKER_03]: as Commissioner of Trust Funds, this position became vacant with the passing of Juan Ramirez.

43
00:02:32,798 --> 00:02:34,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Is Mr. Stepcorder here, please?

44
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:35,500
[SPEAKER_03]: You are welcome.

45
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

46
00:02:38,021 --> 00:02:45,485
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. President, although I don't know the gentleman personally, I have reviewed his resume and it's rather impressive, and I'd ask that the committee move for approval.

47
00:02:46,825 --> 00:02:48,666
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion for approval, Councilor Knight.

48
00:02:48,686 --> 00:02:49,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Second?

49
00:02:49,587 --> 00:02:51,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Second, Mr. President.

50
00:02:51,728 --> 00:02:53,429
[SPEAKER_03]: By Councilor Caraviello on that motion.

51
00:02:53,449 --> 00:02:54,269
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

52
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:55,810
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

53
00:02:56,394 --> 00:02:56,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion carries.

54
00:02:56,994 --> 00:02:58,195
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations and welcome.

55
00:02:58,515 --> 00:02:59,375
[SPEAKER_03]: We're glad to have you.

56
00:03:00,056 --> 00:03:00,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

57
00:03:01,796 --> 00:03:13,881
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to take from unfinished business number 15-734, loan order addition to the DPW facility project fund of $300,000.

58
00:03:14,662 --> 00:03:24,906
[SPEAKER_03]: This motion began its journey with us on November 10th in 2015 after being tabled and referred to committee a number of times.

59
00:03:25,758 --> 00:03:36,403
[SPEAKER_03]: It finally passed its first reading this past March, second reading on March 31st, and now is eligible for a third and final reading on today, April 12th.

60
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:38,064
[SPEAKER_03]: So the chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

61
00:03:38,684 --> 00:03:40,165
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. President, yes, thank you very much.

62
00:03:40,705 --> 00:03:44,047
[SPEAKER_01]: As noted, this matter has been before the council a couple of occasions prior.

63
00:03:44,787 --> 00:03:50,189
[SPEAKER_01]: It's relative to some surveying problems that were had with the Winthrop Street drainage project.

64
00:03:50,389 --> 00:03:51,410
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my understanding that

65
00:03:51,889 --> 00:03:54,710
[SPEAKER_01]: There is litigation subrogation that's in place relatively.

66
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:55,470
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I looking at the right one?

67
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:56,611
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm not looking at the right one.

68
00:03:56,631 --> 00:03:56,611
[SPEAKER_01]: 15-734.

69
00:03:58,051 --> 00:04:00,112
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the DPW facility.

70
00:04:00,152 --> 00:04:01,532
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the DPW facility.

71
00:04:02,392 --> 00:04:04,133
[SPEAKER_03]: We just had to tie the up.

72
00:04:04,153 --> 00:04:05,634
[SPEAKER_03]: There was an underestimate on some.

73
00:04:05,794 --> 00:04:06,614
[SPEAKER_01]: It was underestimated.

74
00:04:06,694 --> 00:04:09,575
[SPEAKER_01]: It was underestimated on the mitigation for the pollution underground, Mr. President.

75
00:04:09,635 --> 00:04:10,235
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yes.

76
00:04:11,035 --> 00:04:13,236
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've passed a couple of readings on this.

77
00:04:13,256 --> 00:04:14,677
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would move for approval on the third reading.

78
00:04:14,717 --> 00:04:16,337
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to get paid one way or the other, Mr. President.

79
00:04:16,357 --> 00:04:17,417
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good.

80
00:04:17,437 --> 00:04:19,078
[SPEAKER_03]: So a motion for approval by Councilor Knight.

81
00:04:19,514 --> 00:04:20,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Seconded by Councilor Falco.

82
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

83
00:04:22,616 --> 00:04:23,356
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor Marks.

84
00:04:25,357 --> 00:04:26,338
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mr. President.

85
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:46,830
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the issue that I've had concern with for a number of months now regarding the original estimate that the city hired an outside consultant to come in and give us an estimate on the contaminants at the DPW yard.

86
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:53,623
[SPEAKER_00]: The estimate was off by, I believe it was 500,000.

87
00:04:54,283 --> 00:04:59,924
[SPEAKER_00]: The estimate was off by 500,000, Mr. President.

88
00:05:00,744 --> 00:05:04,805
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know we had many discussions with Louise.

89
00:05:04,825 --> 00:05:06,066
[SPEAKER_03]: We have before us Ms.

90
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:11,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Louise Miller, the Director of Budget and Finance, who can answer any of our questions.

91
00:05:11,827 --> 00:05:13,407
[SPEAKER_03]: She's answered many of them.

92
00:05:13,467 --> 00:05:14,327
[SPEAKER_00]: She's answered them all.

93
00:05:15,388 --> 00:05:17,008
[SPEAKER_00]: I am in opposition of this paper.

94
00:05:17,421 --> 00:05:24,928
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to explain why, for the viewing audience, Mr. President, that I feel... If it's too comcastic tonight, it will be viewable.

95
00:05:25,508 --> 00:05:26,830
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

96
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:32,775
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to explain my position, why I'm opposed to this, for the fact that...

97
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:45,509
[SPEAKER_00]: The city went out and hired a consultant to come in and provide the city with facts and figures on what it would cost to remove the contaminants at the DPW yard.

98
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:53,435
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be off by $500,000 on a project that was originally estimated at, what was the amount?

99
00:05:53,955 --> 00:05:54,656
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just about $500,000.

100
00:05:54,696 --> 00:05:54,996
[SPEAKER_00]: It was about $500,000.

101
00:05:55,036 --> 00:05:55,757
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were off by $500,000.

102
00:05:55,857 --> 00:05:56,858
[SPEAKER_00]: So the project ended up costing us

103
00:06:03,258 --> 00:06:04,880
[SPEAKER_00]: A million dollars, Mr. President.

104
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:09,504
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not sure, would we pay this outside consultant?

105
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:12,967
[SPEAKER_02]: It was around $150,000.

106
00:06:13,167 --> 00:06:15,870
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have the exact figure.

107
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:23,116
[SPEAKER_00]: So we paid $150,000 to an outside consultant to ask or to let us know what it was going to cost to remove the contaminants.

108
00:06:23,477 --> 00:06:23,817
[SPEAKER_00]: They said $500,000.

109
00:06:25,202 --> 00:06:28,083
[SPEAKER_00]: We started the project, it was closer to $1 million.

110
00:06:28,463 --> 00:06:35,707
[SPEAKER_00]: So we lost $500,000 on that and we paid $150,000 for a consultant that gave us bogus information.

111
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:42,510
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's actually $650,000 in net, which I have a real problem with that.

112
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:53,995
[SPEAKER_00]: And I realize that the remedial treatment of what was under there may have differed based on what they found and so forth.

113
00:06:54,887 --> 00:06:56,328
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a tough time thinking.

114
00:06:58,429 --> 00:07:00,049
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like being a meteorologist.

115
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:04,831
[SPEAKER_00]: You could be right 50% of the time, and you're doing a good job.

116
00:07:05,452 --> 00:07:11,934
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't understand why we'd pay a consultant to come in over $100,000 and be off by 100%.

117
00:07:12,595 --> 00:07:17,497
[SPEAKER_00]: It just doesn't sound right to me, Mr. President.

118
00:07:17,577 --> 00:07:22,639
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those particular reasons, I cannot support this particular funding

119
00:07:23,524 --> 00:07:24,925
[SPEAKER_00]: for the cleanup, Mr. President.

120
00:07:25,806 --> 00:07:27,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Marks, for your frankness.

121
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:34,516
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have a motion for a pull by Councilor Knight, as seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

122
00:07:35,077 --> 00:07:37,260
[SPEAKER_03]: So on that motion, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

123
00:07:38,101 --> 00:07:38,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Caraviello?

124
00:07:38,922 --> 00:07:39,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

00:07:40,403 --> 00:07:40,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

127
00:07:41,264 --> 00:07:42,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight?

128
00:07:42,085 --> 00:07:42,165
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

129
00:07:42,486 --> 00:07:43,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Lungo-Koehn?

129
00:07:43,347 --> 00:07:44,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes

129
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks?

129
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,500
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

129
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli?

129
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,500
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes

129
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,000
[SPEAKER_04]: President Dello Russo?

130
00:07:49,192 --> 00:07:54,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, with a six in the affirmative, one in the negative, the motion passes.

131
00:07:55,724 --> 00:07:56,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations.

132
00:07:57,027 --> 00:07:57,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

133
00:07:57,788 --> 00:07:58,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

134
00:07:58,389 --> 00:07:59,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Loan order passes.

135
00:07:59,767 --> 00:08:00,588
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilors.

136
00:08:00,848 --> 00:08:01,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Ms.

137
00:08:01,328 --> 00:08:01,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Miller.

138
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:06,471
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to take up item number 16-309.

139
00:08:07,331 --> 00:08:14,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, an item eligible for third reading, amended ordinance on outdoor dining.

140
00:08:15,316 --> 00:08:18,358
[SPEAKER_03]: After much consideration, we took this up at tonight.

141
00:08:18,778 --> 00:08:23,321
[SPEAKER_03]: It is eligible for its third and final reading tonight, April 12th.

142
00:08:23,381 --> 00:08:25,702
[SPEAKER_03]: So on the motion for approval by Councilor Knight.

143
00:08:28,624 --> 00:08:29,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

144
00:08:29,432 --> 00:08:37,239
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, Mr. President, it's my understanding that this is just a simple clarification of the existing outdoor dining license ordinance that's in place.
