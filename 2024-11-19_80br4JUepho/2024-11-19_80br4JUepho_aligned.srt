44
00:03:13,135 --> 00:03:13,655
Good evening.

45
00:03:14,476 --> 00:03:25,146
Would anyone like to wave the reading in favor of a brief synopsis from the elections office on the motion of Councilor saying for a brief synopsis from the elections office in lieu of reading the paper.

46
00:03:26,347 --> 00:03:27,468

47
00:03:27,528 --> 00:03:28,228
All those in favor.

48
00:03:28,529 --> 00:03:30,530
I always oppose motion passes.

49
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:31,872
Name and address the record, please.

50
00:03:32,132 --> 00:03:33,253
Hi, I'm Melissa Ripley.

51
00:03:33,273 --> 00:03:35,635
I live at 27 being terrorist in Melrose.

52
00:03:36,661 --> 00:03:38,803
Thank you for having me, letting me come in here today.

53
00:03:39,383 --> 00:03:41,745
Very excited to be here as the elections manager.

54
00:03:42,526 --> 00:03:48,190
Today before you, I would like to ask you to approve the warrant for the 2020 state election, which is November 8th.

55
00:03:49,131 --> 00:03:54,876
The elect, the paperwork in your packet shows the words and precincts that are available for the voters this year.

56
00:03:55,296 --> 00:03:58,618
It also gives a synopsis of all the things that will be on the ballot.

57
00:04:03,169 --> 00:04:04,390
Thank you, Madam President.

58
00:04:06,451 --> 00:04:23,038
Just to confirm a couple of things, I think most folks by now are familiar that there's going to be four ballot questions statewide, which we'll be considering, but I also noticed that there were two ballot questions here that are non-binding that are local ballot questions, questions five and six.

59
00:04:24,259 --> 00:04:28,781
I just wanted to confirm that questions five and six will be on the ballot in

60
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:32,931
Uh, are they in every district or they're not in every district?

61
00:04:32,951 --> 00:04:33,492
Could you tell us?

62
00:04:33,532 --> 00:04:34,852
They're only in two districts.

63
00:04:35,033 --> 00:04:36,013
Could you say which ones there?

64
00:04:36,413 --> 00:04:36,653
Sure.

65
00:04:36,853 --> 00:04:39,195
Let me just pull it open here so I can show you.

66
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:39,375
Sure.

67
00:04:44,597 --> 00:04:44,897
Okay.

68
00:04:44,937 --> 00:04:45,798
Question five.

69
00:04:45,858 --> 00:04:47,238
This question is not binding.

70
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:56,283
It is in Ward one precinct one and two Ward two precinct one and two Ward three precinct one and two.

71
00:04:56,956 --> 00:04:59,278
Ward 4, Precinct 1, and Precinct 2.

72
00:04:59,318 --> 00:05:00,678
Is this just the State Reps District?

73
00:05:01,419 --> 00:05:01,799
Which one?

74
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,100
The 34th?

75
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,121
This looks like all of them.

76
00:05:05,662 --> 00:05:06,943
So number 5 is all.

77
00:05:07,183 --> 00:05:11,045
Number 6 is limited to the wards and precincts.

78
00:05:11,165 --> 00:05:14,387
So as you can see, the different wards and precincts are a little different.

79
00:05:15,768 --> 00:05:20,251
So that would be in the Barber District and the Donato District?

80
00:05:20,471 --> 00:05:20,912
Correct.

81
00:05:21,392 --> 00:05:24,494
OK, so question 6 is just not on the ballot in the Garbally District.

82
00:05:24,763 --> 00:05:25,083
correct.

83
00:05:25,263 --> 00:05:25,624
Got it.

84
00:05:26,104 --> 00:05:33,470
And then could you just let if you have it available, let folks know when early voting is going to be available and where it will be available.

85
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:34,130
Sure.

86
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:39,855
We're still working on the early voting, but the early voting is required by the state to be October 2nd through November 4th.

87
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:43,818
It is likely the early voting will be here on the weekends.

88
00:05:43,898 --> 00:05:47,701
We are required to do six hours each weekend day for early voting.

89
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:47,921
So

90
00:05:48,385 --> 00:05:51,649
probably 8 32 30 on both Saturdays and Sundays.

91
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:55,754
The last day to register to vote will be October 29th.

92
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:59,519
The office will be open until five o'clock for people to register to vote.

93
00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:01,461
However, early voting will only be 8 32 30 that day.

94
00:06:03,538 --> 00:06:07,463
During the week, early voting is available during regular business hours of City Hall.

95
00:06:08,043 --> 00:06:08,284
Great.

96
00:06:08,444 --> 00:06:10,967
And then my last question is on mail balloting.

97
00:06:10,987 --> 00:06:13,891
I know it's a little different for the general versus the primary.

98
00:06:13,911 --> 00:06:21,360
So for the general, if I'm correct, and correct me if I'm wrong, ballots will be accepted as long as they're postmarked by Election Day.

99
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:32,031
Yes, they will be as they will be accepted as long as they're postmarked by Election Day, and they need to be here within a certain time timeframe after the election, so we can allow for counting.

100
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:32,672
Great.

101
00:06:33,973 --> 00:06:34,354
Thank you.

102
00:06:34,854 --> 00:06:35,195
Thank you.

103
00:06:36,636 --> 00:06:37,177
Second, Councilor.

104
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:38,478
That's what I was just saying.

105
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:43,364
Just to clarify, by Election Day, does that include Election Day for the viewers who are watching?

106
00:06:43,957 --> 00:06:47,918
Yes, so it needs to be postmarked by the election day.

107
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:52,399
And if it's not a mail-in ballot, it needs to be here by 8 p.m.

108
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:56,779
Otherwise, we have a couple of days after, so we can count those ballots and receive them.

109
00:06:56,979 --> 00:06:57,299
Thank you.

110
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,860
Thank you for the discussion from councilors.

111
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,161
On that motion to approve from Councilor Night, I second it by vicers and bears.

112
00:07:06,521 --> 00:07:06,661
Yes.

113
00:07:07,701 --> 00:07:08,361
All those in favor?

114
00:07:08,381 --> 00:07:08,901
Aye.

115
00:07:09,201 --> 00:07:09,962
All those opposed?

116
00:07:10,182 --> 00:07:10,822
Motion passes.

117
00:07:11,422 --> 00:07:11,802
Thank you both.

118
00:07:13,384 --> 00:07:15,205
Senate President motion to revert to the regular order of business.

119
00:07:15,925 --> 00:07:19,747
On the motion of Vice President Baird to revert to the regular order of business as seconded by Councilor Knight.

120
00:07:20,427 --> 00:07:21,068
All those in favor?

121
00:07:21,448 --> 00:07:21,588
Aye.

122
00:07:21,668 --> 00:07:22,929
All those opposed?

123
00:07:24,589 --> 00:07:25,490
Motion passes.

124
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,171
22-521 offered by Vice President Baird.

125
00:07:27,271 --> 00:07:42,398
Be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we celebrate Italian Heritage Month this October and recognize the massive contributions Italian and Italian American people have made to Medford, our country and the world, as well as the rich cultural diversity, history, and vibrancy our city owes to the Italian American community.

126
00:07:44,696 --> 00:07:45,636
Thank you, Madam President.

127
00:07:45,817 --> 00:08:03,292
I think the resolution is relatively self-explanatory, but this is Italian Heritage Month, and it's obviously a time to celebrate the contributions of Italian and Italian-American people to our city here in Medford.

128
00:08:03,893 --> 00:08:06,795
As we know, Medford for a long time has had a vibrant

129
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:20,488
Italian community, a place for immigrants from Italy to come here, and then for many generations to raise families, and we can see the impact in our business community, government, culture, everywhere in our city.

130
00:08:20,548 --> 00:08:25,312
And I think it's a great time to recognize Italian Heritage Month.

131
00:08:25,332 --> 00:08:28,955
So I would motion to approve and to join with Councilor Seng's paper 22-525.

132
00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:31,498
Thank you, President Baird.

133
00:08:31,518 --> 00:08:32,539
Going to Councilor Seng.

134
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:36,091
Thank you, I would second that motion, first of all.

135
00:08:37,332 --> 00:08:48,520
In prepping for tonight, I thought of a conversation I had with one of my college mentors, who was a proud Italian American, and he knows Taiwanese culture really well, so my family background.

136
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:57,086
And we had a long talk about the values that we share in common, which are family, community, hard work, amongst other values.

137
00:08:58,286 --> 00:09:12,773
And in Medford, we're extremely fortunate for the rich involvement of Italian Americans in building our city from, as Vice President Barris has stated, from teaching to public safety, work like plumbing and healthcare, public service and beyond.

138
00:09:14,314 --> 00:09:33,390
I just wanted to say I really appreciate that here in Medford I grew up learning about Italian culture, learning the language, learning about Italian foods, and being able to do my little diorama of Galileo's project, which is something I've come to realize outside of Medford is not such a common experience.

139
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:54,834
And I think Medford's past and present proves that these values, family, community, public service, hard work, they are fundamental to who we are as a city, and that the contributions of this community, of the Italian American community, have really shaped who we are, and that they prove that this is larger than any one person.

140
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:56,734
It's really about our community as a whole.

141
00:09:57,834 --> 00:09:58,334
So thank you.

142
00:09:58,354 --> 00:10:00,234
Thank you, Councilor Singh.

143
00:10:00,294 --> 00:10:01,595
Any further discussion from the Council?

144
00:10:03,822 --> 00:10:04,622
Councilor Knight.

145
00:10:04,642 --> 00:10:11,945
I do believe, oh, it must be about a year and a half ago now, this council passed a measure and we sent it to the administration and shocker, never got a response.

146
00:10:12,965 --> 00:10:27,689
But what we asked for was the administration to analyze the feasibility of creating an Italian-American cultural district in South Medford to commemorate the contributions of many of our Italian-American residents here.

147
00:10:27,909 --> 00:10:29,210
When you think about people like

148
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:40,385
Ernesto Martini, Alfredo Russo, and the likes, people that really made a big difference in this community over time.

149
00:10:40,585 --> 00:10:42,266
We've asked the administration to look into that.

150
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:49,087
Year and a half might have gone by now, and we still haven't received anything from it, from the administration.

151
00:10:49,408 --> 00:10:54,172
So I know it's only been a year and a half, and it's usually about three years before we get something back from the administration.

152
00:10:54,793 --> 00:11:00,658
But I'm hoping that maybe we can put a reminder into the administration as maybe a B paper or as an amendment to this paper.

153
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:08,145
I'm asking for an update from the administration on the feasibility of creating an Italian American cultural district as passed by the council previously.

154
00:11:09,547 --> 00:11:10,167
Thank you, Councilor.

155
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,188
Councilor Carvello.

156
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:12,029
Thank you, Madam President.

157
00:11:12,349 --> 00:11:15,011
President, I just want to thank my two councillors for putting this on there.

158
00:11:16,932 --> 00:11:19,474
I'm very proud to be an Italian member of this community.

159
00:11:20,435 --> 00:11:24,638
Both of my parents are Italian American, my grandparents are.

160
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:28,220
And again, I'm glad we're going to recognize the

161
00:11:32,185 --> 00:11:34,947
all the things that Italian Americans have done in this community over the years.

162
00:11:34,987 --> 00:11:37,148
So I stand with Councilor Knight.

163
00:11:37,188 --> 00:11:47,735
I mean, I think I was a co-sponsor of that with him, to have something to recognize the Italian community, but as we see, nothing ever came of it.

164
00:11:47,755 --> 00:11:50,396
But I just want to thank my two councilors for putting it on there.

165
00:11:50,737 --> 00:11:54,139
Took a little bit of heat from the public, because the two Italian guys didn't put it on.

166
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,381
Thank you, Councilor Carviel.

167
00:11:57,481 --> 00:11:59,022
Any further discussion from the council?

168
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:01,653
Thank you.

169
00:12:01,673 --> 00:12:10,822
Thank you for my fellow counsel putting this forward as a first generation American who has a very deep and proud tradition of our Italian culture.

170
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:18,790
I appreciate bringing this forward, but I will tell you to say that the Italian American community isn't

171
00:12:20,063 --> 00:12:35,761
is still a little unhappy in our community, not because of a name change of a school, but because of the discussions of not following through with really celebrating an Italian American and making sure that our community wasn't forgotten.

172
00:12:39,446 --> 00:12:45,010
It's something that I appreciate my colleagues bringing this resolution forward so we can mention it again.

173
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:50,654
I appreciate Councilor Knight and Councilor Carviello for that initiative they did put through a year and a half ago.

174
00:12:50,754 --> 00:12:57,079
But again, I guess if it's not forefront in the news, it's really not a true issue in this community.

175
00:12:57,159 --> 00:13:02,743
So it's disheartening for Councilor Carviello

176
00:13:04,162 --> 00:13:15,094
person like myself that parents came to this country from Italy to make make their their roots to settle their roots and look at follow the American dream.

177
00:13:15,774 --> 00:13:19,378
And and Medford has done that for sure for my family.

178
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:24,323
We're very fortunate that my mom and dad have now passed on but left us.

179
00:13:27,513 --> 00:13:36,556
We leave them at the thanks of everything they've done for us and how they taught us to work hard and really have pride in who we are.

180
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:53,602
And I think that, I just hope this community and this administration follows through what they're saying and what we talked about just a few short years ago, because it seems like it's a culture that is easily forgotten where one time

181
00:13:56,238 --> 00:14:00,222
the Italian culture and the Irish culture in this community built it for what it is today.

182
00:14:00,302 --> 00:14:01,924
Why so many people love this great city.

183
00:14:01,984 --> 00:14:03,025
So thank you.

184
00:14:06,495 --> 00:14:11,216
Um, I just, I just wanted to thank Councilor Knight for the bee papers.

185
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,477
Um, that's that's an issue.

186
00:14:13,517 --> 00:14:16,197
That's an initiative that I, I would support.

187
00:14:16,757 --> 00:14:24,659
Um, I actually, about two years ago, I was in San Diego, which has its little, little Italy.

188
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:26,820
I'm sure President Morello is familiar.

189
00:14:29,719 --> 00:14:42,588
I was actually very touched by, they had signs on the roads, on lampposts, talking about different Italian-Americans and their contributions to both San Diego and to the country.

190
00:14:43,108 --> 00:14:50,653
And it'd be very nice if we could have something like that here in Medford, celebrating the contributions of Italian-Americans to our community.

191
00:14:51,434 --> 00:14:56,958
Perhaps something even more local, more Medford-based, since we have such a rich Italian-American history here.

192
00:14:57,538 --> 00:14:59,480
Um, but again, I support that idea.

193
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,883
Thank you, Councilor saying any further discussion from the council.

194
00:15:03,963 --> 00:15:05,844
Mr Yeah, it's a big paper.

195
00:15:05,884 --> 00:15:08,826
I just see Mr Castagnetti is rare to go.

196
00:15:08,846 --> 00:15:13,450
Name and address for record, please.

197
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,592
Andrew Castagnetti, Christian Street Method Mass.

198
00:15:17,332 --> 00:15:23,177
I want to thank the council for bringing celebrating the Italian Heritage Month.

199
00:15:24,217 --> 00:15:25,338
And I appreciate that.

200
00:15:27,156 --> 00:15:35,380
In my opinion, I might be a bit biased, but Italy, the Italian people's probably the greatest contributors to the world worldwide.

201
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,960
And they'll live in worldwide too.

202
00:15:38,081 --> 00:15:42,203
From the depression days when they had to get out of the country because they couldn't feed themselves.

203
00:15:44,584 --> 00:15:55,008
A few examples of their great leaders would be Da Vinci, Michelangelo, Ferdinand, Galileo, Marconi.

204
00:15:56,069 --> 00:15:56,749
It goes on and on.

205
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,442
Miracle versus Gucci and we're named after that as the Americas.

206
00:16:02,463 --> 00:16:03,423
Thank you, counselor.

207
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:13,109
And Italian cuisine, as a matter of fact, where my folks come from, I'm not first generation, I'm half generation.

208
00:16:13,129 --> 00:16:14,230
I was born in Cambridge.

209
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:17,232
I didn't speak English until I started kindergarten.

210
00:16:17,272 --> 00:16:24,536
I spoke another Italian dialect, one of thousands with all the mountains from the Alps down to the boot heel.

211
00:16:27,289 --> 00:16:38,356
The first gastronomical university in all of Europe was in Bologna, Italy, which is near Venice and Milano.

212
00:16:40,117 --> 00:16:53,965
And to a lot of us, Italo-Americans, the greatest of them all was the most courageous explorer of all time.

213
00:16:55,875 --> 00:17:11,679
Cristoforo Colombo, who said that the world was not flat, he would not fall off it, and he would get to the other side, but he was blocked by a couple of continents in the central, which became America.

214
00:17:14,706 --> 00:17:19,787
Imagine the courage on this guy, the stones, saying the world was wrong.

215
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:26,228
And unfortunately, the King of Italy did not back him, or else it would have been all Italians in Central America.

216
00:17:27,609 --> 00:17:32,590
So Queen Isabella gave him the Nina Pinto and Santa Maria, and so be it.

217
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:38,071
However, it's most unfortunate, and it saddens a lot of

218
00:17:39,149 --> 00:17:45,711
we residents that the Christopher Columbus School was delisted, the name was taken away.

219
00:17:46,492 --> 00:17:59,556
And mind you, that was done during the so-called Corona 19 pandemic when the world was shut down and we could not even attend the meetings live in person, mind you.

220
00:18:00,976 --> 00:18:05,238
I would have loved to have that opportunity to say a few syllables.

221
00:18:07,283 --> 00:18:12,004
I don't know why they took his name down to this day and destroyed statues.

222
00:18:14,685 --> 00:18:18,587
It makes me ill to think of that, the disrespect.

223
00:18:19,127 --> 00:18:33,431
They're saying that he's bad, he's a bad man, but no one's shown me any document that he was convicted of any crime and therefore was a felon.

224
00:18:35,152 --> 00:18:35,832
I don't see it.

225
00:18:37,044 --> 00:18:39,005
All I hear is rumors.

226
00:18:40,405 --> 00:18:46,548
I mean, can all our politicians that were elected, can they truthfully say that they're not felons?

227
00:18:47,468 --> 00:18:51,590
Here, next door, Austin, Washington, D.C.?

228
00:18:54,431 --> 00:19:03,375
Again, I thank you, counselors, for bringing up Italian Heritage Month, but I wish Columbus was back on the school.

229
00:19:03,455 --> 00:19:03,835
Thank you.

230
00:19:04,515 --> 00:19:05,456
Thank you, Mr. Gassig-Knight.

231
00:19:07,611 --> 00:19:09,393
So we will take the B paper first.

232
00:19:09,873 --> 00:19:19,101
So the B paper from Councilor Knight to get an update from the administration on the proposed or the idea of Italian heritage district in the city of Medford, correct?

233
00:19:20,362 --> 00:19:21,003
Cultural district.

234
00:19:25,847 --> 00:19:28,790
Okay, on the proposed Italian American cultural district.

235
00:19:29,745 --> 00:19:31,266
seconded by Councilor Carbiello.

236
00:19:31,306 --> 00:19:32,007
All those in favor?

237
00:19:32,027 --> 00:19:33,468
All those opposed?

238
00:19:33,508 --> 00:19:34,129
Motion passes.

239
00:19:34,709 --> 00:19:40,994
On the main paper that was joined with 22-525, just seconded by Councilor Sang.

240
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:41,715
All those in favor?

241
00:19:41,735 --> 00:19:43,376
All those opposed?

242
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:44,077
Motion passes.

243
00:19:44,097 --> 00:19:48,340
22-525 offered by Vice President Behrs.

244
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:54,465
Be it so resolved by the Medford City Council that we send our deepest condolences to the family and friends of former State Senator Salvatore Albano

245
00:19:55,043 --> 00:20:08,410
On his passing, Senator Albano was a great public servant for Medford, representing the second Middlesex district and passing major legislation to fund the public education, improve community health, and support seniors struggling with the cost of prescription drugs, among many other accomplishments.

246
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:11,632
Be it for the resolve that we dedicate this meeting in honor of Senator Albano.

247
00:20:12,652 --> 00:20:13,433
Vice President Behrs.

248
00:20:13,893 --> 00:20:14,674
Thank you, Madam President.

249
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:33,746
Sal Bono was a state senator for several years, representing the second Middlesex District, which is followed by Senator Shannon who we recognize on an annual basis thanks to Councilor Knight and Senator Jalen, who currently serves in the seat.

250
00:20:35,976 --> 00:21:01,345
While he was a senator, prior to that, he was an alderman in Somerville, involved deeply in the Somerville community activism around building highways and preventing highway construction, improving schools, and building community in Somerville, then went on to win a sticker campaign, a write-in sticker campaign to serve as senator for several years, worked on major legislation, as noted here, around funding public

251
00:21:01,505 --> 00:21:13,115
education, supporting seniors, improving community health, and generally bringing his experience as a family man, businessman, and community activist for the benefit of everyone in this district.

252
00:21:13,155 --> 00:21:16,378
He passed away a few days ago, and

253
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:21,441
his wake was yesterday, and there's going to be a memorial service next year.

254
00:21:21,461 --> 00:21:32,570
I encourage folks to take a look at Senator Jalen's Facebook page, where she issued a much longer memoriam kind of history and memorial statement.

255
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:42,497
But he served our community well, and I think it behooves us to honor him and send our condolences to his family and friends.

256
00:21:42,697 --> 00:21:43,017
Thank you.

257
00:21:43,518 --> 00:21:44,398
Thank you, Vice President Behrs.

258
00:21:44,538 --> 00:21:45,659
Any further discussion from the council?

259
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:51,114
So on the motion of vices and bears as seconded by Councilor Night, all those in favor.

260
00:21:51,795 --> 00:21:53,296
All those opposed, motion passes.

261
00:21:53,316 --> 00:21:58,262
Do you want a moment of silence or just we'll dedicate the meeting?

262
00:21:58,882 --> 00:22:00,304
Okay, please rise for a moment of silence.

263
00:22:17,267 --> 00:22:19,148
22-523 offered by Councilor Carviello.

264
00:22:19,188 --> 00:22:27,071
Be it so resolved that the Medford City Council offer congratulations to Sergeant Barbara D. Cristofaro for being promoted as the first woman sergeant of the Medford Police Department.

265
00:22:27,171 --> 00:22:27,911
Councilor Carviello.

266
00:22:27,931 --> 00:22:30,092
Thank you, Madam President.

267
00:22:30,212 --> 00:22:36,374
Congratulations, Barbara, on a great achievement today that held up many years.

268
00:22:37,434 --> 00:22:41,896
And I'm proud to say she's the first woman sergeant on our police force.

269
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:44,096
So thank you for the chief for promoting her.

270
00:22:44,677 --> 00:22:44,957
And again,

271
00:22:46,001 --> 00:22:50,142
Thank you, Barbara, your friend, and congratulations on your appointment.

272
00:22:50,983 --> 00:22:51,863
Thank you, Councilor Carvialho.

273
00:22:52,423 --> 00:22:53,463
Councilor Naik.

274
00:22:53,483 --> 00:22:56,845
Madam President, thank you very much and thank you to Councilor Carvialho for putting this on.

275
00:22:57,425 --> 00:23:02,146
I've known Barbara DeCristofaro for as long as I can remember growing up in the same neighborhood.

276
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:03,767
Friendly with her father, Jerry, for a number of years.

277
00:23:03,807 --> 00:23:04,407
He was a great guy.

278
00:23:05,616 --> 00:23:11,940
It's glad it's great to see Barbara pursue this promotional opportunity to be appointed by the administration to position sergeant.

279
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:18,003
And I think it's important that you know the brass and our police department is reflective of the population that we serve.

280
00:23:18,744 --> 00:23:26,268
So with that being said, I'm hoping that I reach out director will take steps to encourage minority and female police officers to take these promotional exams.

281
00:23:27,029 --> 00:23:37,820
for Barbara to be promoted the first female sergeant in the city of Medford in the year 2022 is kind of showing that our internal recruitment is lacking.

282
00:23:38,889 --> 00:23:49,920
And we have many talented police officers that are here in this community that would help make the brass in our police department reflective of the population that we have here.

283
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:54,184
But we have to encourage those individuals to apply for the civil service exams.

284
00:23:54,525 --> 00:24:00,090
We need to provide them with the tools necessary to study for the civil service exams so that they'll be in a position

285
00:24:09,217 --> 00:24:10,919
for being one of the first.

286
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:12,841
Thank you, Councilor.

287
00:24:12,901 --> 00:24:14,102
Any further discussion from the Council?

288
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:20,829
On the motion of Councilor Carviello is seconded by second Councilor saying all those in favor.

289
00:24:21,269 --> 00:24:23,111
I suppose motion passes.

290
00:24:23,151 --> 00:24:24,453
Congratulations, Sergeant DeCruz.

291
00:24:25,627 --> 00:24:32,192
22-524 be it so resolved the Medford City Council recognize walk, bike and roll to school day celebrated this year on October 12.

292
00:24:32,252 --> 00:24:38,797
That's Wednesday, October 12, and reaffirm our commitment to making routes to school safer and more accessible for all methods of transportation.

293
00:24:39,217 --> 00:24:39,858
Councillor Collins.

294
00:24:41,065 --> 00:24:42,026
Thank you, President Morrell.

295
00:24:42,867 --> 00:24:51,114
I'm excited for the chance for this council to recognize and for the community to celebrate Walk, Bike and Roll to School Day.

296
00:24:51,174 --> 00:24:54,777
This celebration is a project of a coalition across Massachusetts.

297
00:24:55,417 --> 00:24:57,779
Tomorrow, I have the opportunity to take part in a

298
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,603
bike to school caravan, which I'm very excited for.

299
00:25:02,364 --> 00:25:10,331
But I think that these celebrations are, you know, really take on more meaning when they're tied to action and a commitment to policy.

300
00:25:10,351 --> 00:25:21,922
So I think it's great that we're recognizing the folks that do already take advantage of multimodal ways of getting to school and doing so safely and encouraging that as part of an active lifestyle for our school-age

301
00:25:23,003 --> 00:25:23,363
community.

302
00:25:23,984 --> 00:25:33,555
And at the same time, I think that it reflects the responsibility that city administration has on this body has to making sure that we're putting forth.

303
00:25:33,735 --> 00:25:39,061
Policies in the programs as with as much urgency and speed as we can to make sure that our infrastructure.

304
00:25:41,342 --> 00:26:03,794
our ability to, our shared ability to get to school, to work, to wherever safely through all modes of transportation, increased cycling infrastructure, protected bike lanes being just one piece of that project and making sure that we're allocating the city resources to actually live and protect that vision, not just celebrate it.

305
00:26:04,154 --> 00:26:04,435
Thank you.

306
00:26:04,815 --> 00:26:05,735
Thank you, Councilor Collins.

307
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:06,476
Vice-President Behrs.

308
00:26:07,114 --> 00:26:08,034
Thank you, Madam President.

309
00:26:08,074 --> 00:26:09,875
Thank you, Councilor Collins, for putting this forward.

310
00:26:10,495 --> 00:26:21,298
I know that Safer to School and Walk, Bike and Roll to School Day has been a major initiative of a lot of parents and volunteer activists in the community who have organized the day.

311
00:26:22,259 --> 00:26:30,921
And I just want to acknowledge all their efforts as well as say that we've been focused on the, you know, we've implemented now two Safer to School programs.

312
00:26:30,961 --> 00:26:34,162
We've received grants from the state to implement it.

313
00:26:34,202 --> 00:26:35,103
It's a real priority.

314
00:26:36,843 --> 00:26:47,675
and I think it would go really well with the city taking on a Vision Zero plan to prevent injuries and fatalities on our streets, which is really essential.

315
00:26:47,795 --> 00:26:50,478
It's very important to me personally, and I think important to anyone

316
00:26:51,563 --> 00:26:55,946
really anyone who's ever been on a street and knows that the dangers that folks face.

317
00:26:56,046 --> 00:27:00,309
So we've put forward a couple of resolutions around a vision zero plan.

318
00:27:00,889 --> 00:27:03,591
Also haven't received a response to those resolutions.

319
00:27:04,691 --> 00:27:13,317
So just want to, seems like we've got some counselors down here.

320
00:27:13,337 --> 00:27:17,940
Thank you.

321
00:27:20,503 --> 00:27:24,746
But you know, I would really like to see a response from the administration around a Vision Zero approach.

322
00:27:24,826 --> 00:27:27,687
There's federal grant money available to implement Vision Zero.

323
00:27:28,047 --> 00:27:31,309
And I think that would go along with the spirit of this resolution.

324
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:32,830
So thank you, Councilor Collins.

325
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,751
And I second the motion to approve.

326
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:37,033
Any further discussion from the council?

327
00:27:38,834 --> 00:27:56,921
Madam President, as part of this paper just like an update from the city administration is Council beers mentioned, we had a $1 million grant project that was funded for the safe routes to school, and that created a bike lane from maybe halfway up the hill on high street to the work school, but part of that project also reconfigured the intersection at Wilbur Street high street.

328
00:27:57,521 --> 00:28:01,903
And since that time, property, personal residents that have bought

329
00:28:06,323 --> 00:28:08,865
including flooding, drainage issues and the like.

330
00:28:09,606 --> 00:28:16,091
We've seen McKay construction out there at least six times since this project was supposed to be completed.

331
00:28:16,911 --> 00:28:32,483
So I'd just like to get an update from the administration as to what the status of the drainage issue is on the corner of Woobin and High Street and how much money the city's expended since the completion of the $1 million grant project and remedying the design defects and on property damage claims since this project's been completed.

332
00:28:33,066 --> 00:28:33,746
Thank you, Councilor.

333
00:28:33,786 --> 00:28:34,766
Councilor Carvio.

334
00:28:34,786 --> 00:28:36,007
Thank you, Madam President.

335
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:38,067
Thank you, Council Member for bringing it up.

336
00:28:38,207 --> 00:28:40,227
I've been involved with that project since it started.

337
00:28:40,908 --> 00:28:44,428
If anyone's driven by, notice it got dug up again for the third time.

338
00:28:45,289 --> 00:28:53,450
Put back, and then if you talk to the city engineer and the company, they're telling you that they don't think this is going to work anyways.

339
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:55,991
I don't even know why they dug it up again, did it?

340
00:28:56,331 --> 00:29:00,932
But I urge the engineer not to sign off on this until the

341
00:29:02,603 --> 00:29:03,784
It's proven that it's going to work.

342
00:29:04,205 --> 00:29:08,008
And the other issue is the neighbors be made whole.

343
00:29:08,989 --> 00:29:16,115
They've got lawsuits, and they're just pretty much being ignored by either the state or the contractor, which isn't fair to them.

344
00:29:16,535 --> 00:29:19,598
They're spending money on legal claims that they shouldn't have had to do.

345
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:28,866
And when you talk to the guys there, they'll tell you that the pump-out comes out too far because it diverts the water into their house instead of away from the house.

346
00:29:30,157 --> 00:29:32,679
I'd like to, I know the project is done again.

347
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:44,051
I don't know what the final outcome, but I've, I've urged the engineer not to sign off on this until sometime find out if it actually works because they're doubting that it's going to even work.

348
00:29:49,503 --> 00:29:57,906
I do just want to add, I want to thank Councilor Collins for bringing this forward as someone who bike commutes to work whenever I can, I mean it's it's terrifying as an adult to ride on the streets.

349
00:29:58,386 --> 00:29:59,386
It doesn't have to be that way.

350
00:29:59,807 --> 00:30:11,611
So I think programs like this, I mean infrastructure is really what we need, but programs like this go a long way, especially just announcing at a council meeting letting people to know, you know, pay extra attention to Martin's going to be a lot of kids, a lot of families on the roads.

351
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:17,961
doing what they have every right to do, taking their bikes, walking, rolling, whatever they can do to get to school.

352
00:30:18,121 --> 00:30:22,123
So on the motion of Councilor Collins, as seconded by vice chairs and bears, all those in favor.

353
00:30:22,243 --> 00:30:27,724
Oh, sorry, as amended by Councilor Knight, seconded by vice chair and bears, all those in favor.

354
00:30:28,024 --> 00:30:29,805
All those opposed, motion passes.

355
00:30:32,806 --> 00:30:41,048
So 22-526 offered by Councilor Seng, be it so resolved that the city council recognize October as domestic abuse awareness month, Councilor Seng.

356
00:30:41,397 --> 00:30:42,417
Thank you, President Morrell.

357
00:30:43,298 --> 00:30:45,779
October is Domestic Abuse Awareness Month.

358
00:30:46,419 --> 00:30:55,223
Domestic abuse is a issue that unfortunately touches a lot of residents in the city, in the state, around the world.

359
00:30:56,584 --> 00:31:08,670
And I think it's important for us to be able to speak more openly about it as a society and to talk about the effects of domestic abuse, to talk about trauma, and to talk about mental health.

360
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:32,340
Um, I was fortunate enough to be, um, at a, um, event with the Metro Police Department and Portal to Hope with Councilor Carabiello, where we learned a lot about how, um, trauma, we can use trauma to inform the work that we do in the workplace and as elected officials in our policies, which, um, really starts by listening and understanding.

361
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:42,142
this is, of course, a very serious issue, and I am grateful for the opportunity to be able to bring some light to it on the council.

362
00:31:43,002 --> 00:31:43,703
Thank you, Councilor Sang.

363
00:31:43,723 --> 00:31:44,883
Councilor Carvalho.

364
00:31:45,023 --> 00:31:45,723
Thank you, Madam President.

365
00:31:45,743 --> 00:31:49,084
Thank you, Councilor Tang, for putting this on.

366
00:31:49,204 --> 00:32:00,967
Like the Councilor said, himself and myself, we attended the Puddle of Hope conference at the police station, and I want to thank the Chief

367
00:32:02,805 --> 00:32:13,767
being proactive in this, and people don't know, Puerto Rico has an office in the building to help women that need it.

368
00:32:13,827 --> 00:32:22,729
I've been involved with Debbie Fallon and this group since its inception some years ago, and she does a great job with the program.

369
00:32:23,309 --> 00:32:27,650
And it's a shame that, you know, when we were there that day, you know, they get up there and they recognize

370
00:32:28,908 --> 00:32:38,335
that have passed this year, Justin read a few names, I read a bunch of names, most of all of us read names, people who died senselessly from domestic abuse.

371
00:32:39,015 --> 00:32:52,285
In fact, talk about today, I happened to go to the police station for something else and there was a young woman in there and she was filling out for something and she was crying and during that

372
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:58,804
And before she left, I says, you know, I says, I hate to let you know that I overheard what you're talking about.

373
00:32:58,824 --> 00:33:02,207
I said, do you know that Port of Life has an office in this building?

374
00:33:02,227 --> 00:33:02,787
So I didn't know.

375
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:05,409
And I gave her the card and said, oh, thank you for the help.

376
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:15,917
And so just, you know, just a shame that, you know, see this young woman, you know, just fairly recently married, saying they're crying at the police station looking for help.

377
00:33:16,357 --> 00:33:20,560
And again, it's just a shame that this goes on in our country.

378
00:33:20,906 --> 00:33:22,206
And there's so many reasons for it.

379
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:32,770
Like I said, like Councilor Tang said, you know, they had a psychologist and they spoke about all the things that women have to go through and how they have to hide from their husband.

380
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:36,731
And it's just a shame that this even goes on in a civilized country.

381
00:33:37,451 --> 00:33:46,394
And again, I thank my council for putting this on and shout out to Debbie Fallon who started this bulldog program many years ago.

382
00:33:46,414 --> 00:33:48,955
I'm proud to be a partner with them

383
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:51,062
in that program, so good.

384
00:33:51,482 --> 00:33:51,803
Thank you.

385
00:33:52,323 --> 00:33:53,184
Thank you, Councilor Carvalho.

386
00:33:53,224 --> 00:33:54,565
Any further discussion from the Council?

387
00:33:56,266 --> 00:33:58,328
On a motion of Councilor Sang, seconded by...

388
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:00,700
Councilor Carviel, all those in favor?

389
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,381
All those opposed?

390
00:34:02,521 --> 00:34:03,221
Motion passes.

391
00:34:03,621 --> 00:34:04,401
The next one is for me.

392
00:34:04,481 --> 00:34:06,862
I will read unless anyone is opposed.

393
00:34:07,102 --> 00:34:08,822
Great.

394
00:34:08,842 --> 00:34:23,586
22-527 offered by President Morrell, whereas Godfrey de Corso Chevalier, born on March 7th, 1889, grew up on Bradshaw Street and Summit Road in the city, whereas as a 1906 graduate of Medford High School, he was a standout student athlete and leader, whereas he was a graduate from the U.S.

395
00:34:23,606 --> 00:34:27,867
Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland in 1910, whereas on October 1st,

396
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:50,136
1910 he single handedly rescued 16 sailors from drowning in New York's Hudson River after the barge they were riding overturned in high winds, whereas he was appointed naval air pilot number seven in November 1915 and would go on to train notable aviators Richard Byrd and Wilmer Stultz, whereas he committed the first naval aeronautical detachment to reach France during World War One at Dunkirk

397
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:55,114
Maintaining the station despite constant enemy bombing, he later was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal.

398
00:34:55,594 --> 00:35:02,076
Whereas in 1922, he was attached to the USS Langley, which would become the Navy's first aircraft carrier in connection with fitting her out.

399
00:35:02,616 --> 00:35:14,300
Whereas on October 26th, 1922, he flew plane number 606 and Air Marine 39B onto the Langley as it was underway off Cape Henry, Virginia, marking the first American landing on a moving aircraft carrier.

400
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,580
Whereas on November 14th, 1922,

401
00:35:17,411 --> 00:35:30,561
He died at the Norfolk Virginia Naval Hospital as a result of injuries sustained in an airplane crash during flying maneuvers two days earlier, whereas the city of Medford dedicated the new Chevalier Auditorium in his honor on March 7, 1940, on what would have been his 51st birthday.

402
00:35:31,042 --> 00:35:41,850
Be it so resolved that the Medford City Council recognize the contributions of Godfrey Chevalier, dedicate this meeting to him, and ask that the administration proclaim October 26 as Godfrey Chevalier Day in the city of Medford.

403
00:35:42,318 --> 00:35:50,945
I think this paper speaks to for itself and all the contributions, Mr. Shabali has made to the country, as well as being a Medford native son.

404
00:35:51,025 --> 00:36:00,133
And this came through from Ken Krause, who's the treasurer at the friends of the Chevalier and Gene Mack, Jim, and I would seek a motion for approval.

405
00:36:00,473 --> 00:36:03,856
Can you just explain what the significance of October 26th is?

406
00:36:04,476 --> 00:36:08,419
I believe as October 26th being the date that he flew the plane, landing onto the,

407
00:36:09,521 --> 00:36:11,982
the first American landing onto a moving aircraft carrier.

408
00:36:12,022 --> 00:36:16,164
I think there's a number of dates we could choose from, and that was the date requested by the friend of the Toralea.

409
00:36:16,184 --> 00:36:17,704
Okay, perfect, thank you.

410
00:36:17,724 --> 00:36:18,665
Vice President Behrs.

411
00:36:18,725 --> 00:36:19,565
Madam President, thank you.

412
00:36:19,605 --> 00:36:23,867
If we could just amend it to say that he was born on March 7th, 1889.

413
00:36:25,267 --> 00:36:28,449
Otherwise, he was a incredibly talented seven-year-old.

414
00:36:28,949 --> 00:36:34,311
Thank you for captioning that, Vice President Behrs.

415
00:36:35,631 --> 00:36:36,732
Any further discussion from the council?

416
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:41,081
So on the motion of councilor Knight to move approval as amended.

417
00:36:41,141 --> 00:36:43,762
Second by councilor saying all those in favor.

418
00:36:43,782 --> 00:36:44,202
All right.

419
00:36:44,522 --> 00:36:45,342
All those opposed.

420
00:36:45,702 --> 00:36:46,362
Motion passes.

421
00:36:46,522 --> 00:36:47,182
Madam president.

422
00:36:47,462 --> 00:36:48,103
Vice-president Behrs.

423
00:36:48,203 --> 00:36:53,844
Motion to suspend the rules to take paper 22-532 as well as our public participation papers.

424
00:36:54,984 --> 00:37:02,826
On the motion of vice-president Behrs to take paper to suspend the rules take paper 22-532 as well as our public participation papers as second by councilor saying all those in favor.

425
00:37:03,006 --> 00:37:03,347
All right.

426
00:37:03,507 --> 00:37:04,147
All those opposed.

427
00:37:04,207 --> 00:37:04,867
Motion passes.

428
00:37:06,258 --> 00:37:21,526
22-532 offered by vice was embarrassed be as a result by the Metro City Council, the city request that the August a bush slash Budweiser facility on 440 Riverside Avenue provide significant additional mitigation to residents on Sydney Street to address the impact of noise light and traffic on local families.

429
00:37:22,617 --> 00:37:23,517
Thank you, Madam President.

430
00:37:23,838 --> 00:37:34,543
It's come to my attention that residents on Sydney Street are facing some difficulties with the facility Budweiser facility, both temporary and permanent.

431
00:37:34,563 --> 00:37:41,547
There's some temporary changes that have moved a lot of idling trucks and things right into people's basically right across the fence from their backyard.

432
00:37:41,567 --> 00:37:46,369
You got folks looking, you know, whether intentionally or unintentionally, you know, you're looking right into people's houses.

433
00:37:46,409 --> 00:37:47,610
There's a lot of noise, a lot of,

434
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,221
you know, just negative impacts on the residents of Sydney Street.

435
00:37:51,882 --> 00:37:54,683
And then also some long-term mitigation would be welcome.

436
00:37:54,903 --> 00:38:07,110
Basically all that the facility has said that they would do is they'll put up a, you know, kind of something on the fence, a solid barrier, which really isn't enough to mitigate the noise and, you know, other impacts of that.

437
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:17,256
So I do know that we have some residents here who are interested in speaking on it, and hopefully we can communicate with the facility to get a little bit more support for those residents.

438
00:38:18,105 --> 00:38:18,946
Thank you, Vice President Behrs.

439
00:38:18,966 --> 00:38:20,386
Name and address for the record, please.

440
00:38:20,526 --> 00:38:22,187
Hello, my name's Nadia Puriforia.

441
00:38:22,228 --> 00:38:23,728
I live at 42 Sydney Street.

442
00:38:24,229 --> 00:38:27,711
Good evening, City Council, and thank you, Zach Behrs, for the invite.

443
00:38:28,111 --> 00:38:34,555
So I've lived there since 2005, and basically, it's right behind my house, and there's not been many issues.

444
00:38:34,615 --> 00:38:39,478
We've just dealt with light noises through the years, and they've been pretty good neighbors.

445
00:38:39,538 --> 00:38:45,962
But just as of this past summer, we have a pool right in the backyard, and they are apparently working in the parking lot.

446
00:38:46,382 --> 00:39:05,826
but they move their trucks like literally behind our backyard and I have five young girls I have a swimming pool and there's men out there at their lunch breaks and they're parked like along the fence and now since they're doing work in the parking lot they put their actual trucks like right along our fence and it's day and night you get the trucks unloading it's a loud bang it could be two in the morning

447
00:39:06,608 --> 00:39:10,930
Um, in the back of the trucks, you can see cases of beer that's just right there visible.

448
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:14,872
Like it's just, uh, beyond being, um, an ugly eyesore.

449
00:39:14,912 --> 00:39:17,874
It's the noise, the lights go right into my girl's bedroom.

450
00:39:18,494 --> 00:39:25,037
And last summer they, um, I did speak with the mayor and she called them because originally there was a lot of trees, but the trees were dead.

451
00:39:25,057 --> 00:39:25,938
So they cut them down.

452
00:39:26,673 --> 00:39:31,659
And they said they'll put this like cloth sheet up and it basically lasted a couple months fell down.

453
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:38,206
And I did speak with the mayor again over the summer and she said she would contact them and they put up a little cloth sheet.

454
00:39:38,266 --> 00:39:41,170
It's just literally behind my house and it doesn't do anything.

455
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:43,232
There's still people coming out for lunch breaks.

456
00:39:43,732 --> 00:39:48,974
It doesn't do anything with the noise and also the pollution, the trucks are like literally running nonstop.

457
00:39:50,015 --> 00:39:58,398
So I was hoping for the house next to mine has like pine trees behind her house and you really can't see the trucks, you can't see the light, it helps with the noise.

458
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:10,384
I did bring pictures along if anyone wants to see them, but we're hoping either for a wall or something more permanent, because this really isn't helping things.

459
00:40:10,444 --> 00:40:12,885
And it's once again, like I said, the privacy, the noise,

460
00:40:14,085 --> 00:40:16,591
Um, I'm just, I don't know who's in that parking lot.

461
00:40:16,611 --> 00:40:21,602
So, and I have seven children, so there's a lot of, um, my friend, their friends coming over and stuff.

462
00:40:21,622 --> 00:40:24,228
So I was just hoping for something to happen.

463
00:40:25,157 --> 00:40:26,138
Thank you.

464
00:40:26,398 --> 00:40:27,378
I don't know if I leave these.

465
00:40:27,398 --> 00:40:28,259
Yeah, we can.

466
00:40:28,299 --> 00:40:28,459
Yeah.

467
00:40:28,499 --> 00:40:29,119
Okay.

468
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,281
Do you want to come to Carlyle?

469
00:40:32,502 --> 00:40:33,982
Our city messenger is out tonight.

470
00:40:34,062 --> 00:40:35,543
So he would normally grab it.

471
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:35,964
Yeah.

472
00:40:36,424 --> 00:40:44,649
Madam President, the city clerk be so kind as to investigate report back to the council as to whether or not BJ says any special permits extended our permit.

473
00:40:44,669 --> 00:40:54,215
So like, I think one way that we may be able to address this is by bringing them in and saying this is an issue that's going on in the community and you have a permit.

474
00:40:55,385 --> 00:41:00,807
and we don't like what you're doing, so we're gonna take a look at your permit and see if we can put some restrictions on it to safeguard the neighborhood.

475
00:41:01,187 --> 00:41:06,749
This has been an ongoing issue since I got on the council, between Budweiser and BJ's, you know what I mean?

476
00:41:06,809 --> 00:41:13,071
Tough neighbors, you know, large employers in this community, valuable neighbors, you know, bring some good to the community, no doubt.

477
00:41:13,791 --> 00:41:15,111
But you have to live there, I don't, right?

478
00:41:15,131 --> 00:41:17,912
And you know, I know where you live, I know where your house is.

479
00:41:18,012 --> 00:41:20,173
It's not a little tiny little street, you know what I mean?

480
00:41:20,253 --> 00:41:23,334
It's not exactly- It used to be a once peaceful, now I just, you know,

481
00:41:26,073 --> 00:41:27,724
I don't even wanna go in my backyard anymore.

482
00:41:29,145 --> 00:41:31,967
Well, when it's warm, if you don't wanna go and use your pool, I will.

483
00:41:34,669 --> 00:41:37,691
And I don't care about those crummy old men over there with their beer.

484
00:41:37,831 --> 00:41:39,032
I'll watch them and they watch me.

485
00:41:43,635 --> 00:41:47,357
No, I think that the best bet would be to see if we can call the brass in for BJ.

486
00:41:47,377 --> 00:41:48,278
We've tried this before.

487
00:41:48,858 --> 00:41:55,983
I mean, ultimately, I don't think it's gonna help situations that we are right now in the middle of litigation with BJs because we didn't want them to put a gas station in.

488
00:41:57,418 --> 00:42:05,673
So there's a lot of moving parts going on with that location, but I think that the special permit might be the best way to attack it.

489
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:12,233
Thank you, and thank you, Mr. Pierre, for coming out and let us know.

490
00:42:13,074 --> 00:42:20,840
Again, my recommendation, if we can have our code enforcement officer there on a daily basis, because money talks.

491
00:42:21,701 --> 00:42:26,065
So every time we see a violation, we should be taking these violations.

492
00:42:26,365 --> 00:42:30,649
And if it happens three, four times a day, then they should be taken three, four times a day.

493
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:34,952
Like Councilor Knight said, it's getting frustrating for us

494
00:42:35,833 --> 00:42:45,276
that when you talk, try to have a conversation or work together with these bigger companies, falls on deaf ears and it's frustrating.

495
00:42:45,756 --> 00:42:58,780
So I think if we can make a recommendation that we ask a code enforcement officer to make, you know, two trips a day and, you know, really have a pipeline that

496
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:06,404
Mr. Purifori can call them directly, and when you see and hear a violation, that we call them right away and they come right over.

497
00:43:07,245 --> 00:43:19,352
I've had issues with something as simple as a construction project going on in Fulton Street that we had neighbors, trucks were parking on the sidewalk, kids were trying to walk to school, so we set it up that

498
00:43:20,435 --> 00:43:23,717
The constituents that saw something, they called me, I called the code enforcement.

499
00:43:24,157 --> 00:43:28,780
After the fourth ticket, there hasn't been a truck parked on Fulton Street on the sidewalk.

500
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:34,384
So I think that if this is how you have to do it, this is how we have to do it.

501
00:43:35,264 --> 00:43:38,546
It's frustrating, but it's the only way that I see it.

502
00:43:38,966 --> 00:43:41,288
We've asked him to come in to talk to him, his partners.

503
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:48,151
And between BJ's and Budweiser, there really hasn't been much of a partnership.

504
00:43:48,191 --> 00:43:51,232
So if we can do that, that'd be something that I would recommend.

505
00:43:51,252 --> 00:43:51,892
So thank you.

506
00:43:52,252 --> 00:43:53,173
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

507
00:43:53,233 --> 00:43:57,674
I think to that point, it's more than five minutes of idling is, you know, it's against state law.

508
00:43:57,694 --> 00:43:59,014
So it's not even Medford, it's state.

509
00:43:59,674 --> 00:44:00,574
Thank you, Madam President.

510
00:44:01,154 --> 00:44:08,536
I was going to bring that up, but under federal law, anything more than five minutes is a violation of the admissions there.

511
00:44:09,336 --> 00:44:10,757
Were you there when we had that walkthrough?

512
00:44:12,478 --> 00:44:16,363
Like, like before five years ago we did, we had agreed to hold me right on the property there.

513
00:44:16,824 --> 00:44:25,134
We walked through and I know a little bit of something got done I know it wasn't done to the satisfaction that we right but I'm Scott was right.

514
00:44:26,235 --> 00:44:27,277
I think we need to find out.

515
00:44:29,579 --> 00:44:37,461
what laws they're violating, and yeah, cite it in the park book, and that seems to be the only language they recognize.

516
00:44:37,501 --> 00:44:41,023
And if we need to have another committee of the whole meeting down there in person, so be it.

517
00:44:42,203 --> 00:44:44,384
Just to let them know that we are serious about that.

518
00:44:44,784 --> 00:44:47,625
And it's not fair that they park all those trucks there all the time.

519
00:44:49,045 --> 00:44:49,165
Yeah.

520
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:57,303
how it's the trucks, but they said it's because- Are they doing what, working the parking lot out there?

521
00:44:57,323 --> 00:45:09,214
Supposedly, and they said the trucks will go back to the original area and their cars will come back, but I'm still concerned because they're out there in their lunch breaks and they put their chairs against our fence and it just- Yeah, so that's not fair.

522
00:45:09,254 --> 00:45:09,435
Yeah.

523
00:45:10,567 --> 00:45:12,068
Yeah, I think they're right.

524
00:45:12,108 --> 00:45:14,149
I think the only way to hit them is in the park book.

525
00:45:14,189 --> 00:45:23,795
And I say we have the court of course, McDonald, go down there and let them know about what's going on down there.

526
00:45:24,115 --> 00:45:26,476
Even the violation of the federal admission standards.

527
00:45:27,197 --> 00:45:29,978
Yeah, those are definitely running through the night.

528
00:45:30,739 --> 00:45:33,360
Five minutes is five minutes is definitely longer than five minutes.

529
00:45:34,741 --> 00:45:35,581
Thank you, Councilor Carvalho.

530
00:45:35,621 --> 00:45:36,202
Vice Chair Behrs.

531
00:45:37,045 --> 00:45:39,147
Thank you to my fellow councillors.

532
00:45:39,187 --> 00:45:40,649
I think we have a lot of great options.

533
00:45:43,187 --> 00:45:45,808
I think we'll reach out to them and see if we can get something.

534
00:45:46,688 --> 00:45:50,530
If they respond to us at any sort of time, maybe we can get some mitigation done right away.

535
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:51,570
Excuse me.

536
00:45:52,031 --> 00:45:55,352
And if not, we'll look at, things are just falling from the sky today.

537
00:45:55,832 --> 00:45:57,953
We'll look at the special permit and the fines.

538
00:45:58,133 --> 00:46:03,215
And I think Councilor Morrell and Councilor Carpio's point about idling is a major point as well.

539
00:46:03,255 --> 00:46:04,115
So we'll see what we can do.

540
00:46:04,416 --> 00:46:06,957
And then do I just appear by email or?

541
00:46:07,497 --> 00:46:10,098
I'll keep you in the loop on anything that we hear back.

542
00:46:18,790 --> 00:46:23,915
I think it is important to point out, though, that this is really a function of the administration.

543
00:46:23,935 --> 00:46:27,798
I remember when Mike McGlynn was the mayor, he'd get in his car and drive down there and say, I want to meet with the general manager.

544
00:46:28,278 --> 00:46:29,619
He wouldn't pick up the phone and call him.

545
00:46:29,639 --> 00:46:31,741
He'd say, this is what I want done, and go down there to meet with them.

546
00:46:31,941 --> 00:46:35,565
If you're not getting that type of service, you're not getting that type of service, and we'll do all that we can.

547
00:46:35,585 --> 00:46:39,788
But ultimately, this is an enforcement issue, not a legislative issue.

548
00:46:39,848 --> 00:46:42,090
So the administration has to buy into this.

549
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:45,113
And if the administration wants to see it stop, then they have to send their people down there.

550
00:46:45,833 --> 00:46:49,195
They have to send code enforcement down there and they have to hold VJs accountable.

551
00:46:49,215 --> 00:46:50,215
This council can't do that.

552
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:54,698
We can call them to the meetings and we can try to work on the permits that fall under our purview.

553
00:46:55,098 --> 00:47:00,281
But when it comes to the day-to-day operations of the community and code enforcement, that's a department that falls under the building commissioner.

554
00:47:00,841 --> 00:47:06,025
for an administrative branch and executive branch department, the mayor has to get them down there.

555
00:47:06,425 --> 00:47:07,886
And we can ask until we're blue in the face.

556
00:47:07,966 --> 00:47:13,691
But if a track record of asking is any indication as to what the administration is going to do, this is going to go on a file like this big right here.

557
00:47:13,971 --> 00:47:14,151
Yes.

558
00:47:14,251 --> 00:47:17,734
And we're not going to we're not going to hear back because that's historically what's happened.

559
00:47:17,894 --> 00:47:18,254
We've talked

560
00:47:18,294 --> 00:47:20,616
about it all day today in our previous meetings as well.

561
00:47:21,597 --> 00:47:27,083
We had a subcommittee meeting today to talk about two pieces of draft ordinances that we've asked for.

562
00:47:27,123 --> 00:47:28,885
The first one was offered in 2019.

563
00:47:28,985 --> 00:47:32,329
It was a two-sentence draft ordinance that needed review.

564
00:47:32,369 --> 00:47:33,610
The administration didn't get back to us.

565
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:33,670
us.

566
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:39,331
The second item was offered in 2020 was a little bit more involved but again the administration still hasn't responded to us.

567
00:47:39,791 --> 00:47:47,713
So these are items that this council is asking for for us to create legislation in this community, and we're not getting any, any cooperation.

568
00:47:48,473 --> 00:47:56,155
So my advice to you would be also to be sure to stay on the administration and let them know your level of dissatisfaction, because they're really the only ones that can solve this

569
00:48:02,363 --> 00:48:03,184
We're ready to fight with you.

570
00:48:03,344 --> 00:48:03,744
Thank you.

571
00:48:03,764 --> 00:48:04,484
I appreciate it.

572
00:48:04,684 --> 00:48:06,585
And use as much authority and power that we have.

573
00:48:07,126 --> 00:48:10,968
However, that scope and authority is limited under the purview of our responsibilities.

574
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:12,829
Because we want to stay in our homes.

575
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:13,049
Right.

576
00:48:13,129 --> 00:48:13,629
Exactly.

577
00:48:13,709 --> 00:48:14,970
Exactly.

578
00:48:15,010 --> 00:48:16,091
It's a great quiet street.

579
00:48:16,131 --> 00:48:17,211
It's a great quiet street.

580
00:48:17,492 --> 00:48:18,372
It is.

581
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:19,873
Only one way in.

582
00:48:20,377 --> 00:48:21,678
Yep.

583
00:48:22,278 --> 00:48:23,378
Well, thank you for everything.

584
00:48:23,398 --> 00:48:24,179
I appreciate it.

585
00:48:24,379 --> 00:48:24,739
Thank you.

586
00:48:25,079 --> 00:48:25,799
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

587
00:48:25,879 --> 00:48:33,443
So on any further discussion from the council on the motion of vices and bears as amended by Councilor Knight and Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Carviello.

588
00:48:33,523 --> 00:48:34,203
All those in favor?

589
00:48:34,503 --> 00:48:34,643
Aye.

590
00:48:35,003 --> 00:48:35,804
All those opposed?

591
00:48:35,844 --> 00:48:36,664
The motion passes.

592
00:48:36,704 --> 00:48:37,344
Thank you, Mrs. Perlman.

593
00:48:37,364 --> 00:48:37,684
Thank you.

594
00:48:37,844 --> 00:48:40,345
Have a great night.

595
00:48:41,246 --> 00:48:41,486
Yes.

596
00:48:41,586 --> 00:48:41,726
Yep.

597
00:48:41,766 --> 00:48:45,107
We have, we have two papers that were submitted beforehand and then we'll open it.

598
00:48:45,148 --> 00:48:46,008
I know there's some other folks.

599
00:48:46,728 --> 00:48:47,208
as well.

600
00:48:47,288 --> 00:48:51,531
So we'll go to the papers and the agenda and then we'll go to other folks here as well.

601
00:48:51,591 --> 00:48:57,153
So just making sure so public participation just making sure I'm starting at the right place.

602
00:48:58,414 --> 00:49:07,499
So to the Honorable City Council the undersigned respectfully pray parking meters in front of my house on 135 High Street and also in front of St.

603
00:49:07,559 --> 00:49:15,283
Joe's School and Church petitioner signature Rita Bartholomew 135 High Street is Rita, Rita, please come up.

604
00:49:17,392 --> 00:49:19,913
and then we already have your name and address for the record, so go right ahead.

605
00:49:20,133 --> 00:49:30,075
Okay, well, I just want to say, first of all, thank you to Councilman Caviello for addressing the issue as promptly as he did, and the rest of the council.

606
00:49:30,096 --> 00:49:37,998
I was really quite upset to go out on a Saturday morning and see that I had parking meter pole in front of my house.

607
00:49:40,178 --> 00:49:43,279
I don't think that they belong in front of private residents.

608
00:49:43,439 --> 00:49:46,260
I don't think that they belong in front of a church or a school.

609
00:49:46,946 --> 00:49:54,528
for me personally, if the meter is there and I have to park in front of my house, I have to run out all day long and feed a meter.

610
00:49:55,148 --> 00:49:59,530
If my family members want to visit me, they're going to have to do the same thing.

611
00:49:59,690 --> 00:50:04,771
So I was really upset that the city would do something like that.

612
00:50:05,111 --> 00:50:10,233
And I'm just hoping that, you know, once you all revisit it, that

613
00:50:11,246 --> 00:50:21,073
I won't see a meter in front of my house, but I do want to thank you and for, you know, doing whatever you just did and worked your magic so that the meter was not put in.

614
00:50:21,513 --> 00:50:22,354
So thank you very much.

615
00:50:22,754 --> 00:50:23,115
Thank you, Ms.

616
00:50:23,135 --> 00:50:23,695
Bartholomew.

617
00:50:24,275 --> 00:50:25,356
Councilor Carvillo then Councilor Knight.

618
00:50:25,476 --> 00:50:26,857
I think, I think someone else wants to speak.

619
00:50:26,917 --> 00:50:27,458
Oh, okay.

620
00:50:27,878 --> 00:50:31,761
On the same, on the, do you want me to go to the next parking paper or Councilor Knight?

621
00:50:31,941 --> 00:50:39,967
So Rita, does this mean you're not going to go to the celebration on the completion of the Medford square meter project ice cream truck that the mayor wants to do?

622
00:50:45,323 --> 00:50:53,906
I agree with you, and I know Councilor Carvialo and I had spoke on this, and Ricky was telling me how involved he was in working with Faye and the administration to get those taken out.

623
00:50:56,446 --> 00:50:59,247
It seems like the left hand doesn't know what the right is doing a lot of time.

624
00:51:01,888 --> 00:51:02,548
Thank you, Madam President.

625
00:51:02,568 --> 00:51:04,029
There's someone else on that paper, Councilor Carvialo?

626
00:51:04,049 --> 00:51:05,009
Thank you, Madam President.

627
00:51:06,490 --> 00:51:11,951
Mr. Bartolomeo called me on Saturday, and in all honesty, I didn't notice the polls were up.

628
00:51:12,071 --> 00:51:14,092
She called me and told me, I went by her house and looked,

629
00:51:15,165 --> 00:51:19,526
kind of astounded that they went down as far as they did, uh, blocking school.

630
00:51:19,546 --> 00:51:23,627
And I was even more shocked when I saw it was going to be four in front of St.

631
00:51:23,647 --> 00:51:24,267
Joseph's church.

632
00:51:25,287 --> 00:51:31,428
You know, so, uh, listen, you want to put meters in that's fine, but don't put them in front of people's houses.

633
00:51:31,508 --> 00:51:34,408
And especially you don't put them in front of houses of worship.

634
00:51:35,169 --> 00:51:39,369
I never, I mean, we do have some scruples in this community.

635
00:51:39,389 --> 00:51:41,090
I hope to do that.

636
00:51:41,110 --> 00:51:42,910
And, um, and, um,

637
00:51:43,693 --> 00:51:47,837
I got a call from the church eight o'clock Sunday morning.

638
00:51:47,857 --> 00:51:56,545
I got a call from the school Monday morning, and I think I notified all the counselors on Sunday that this was happening to stop planning on getting calls.

639
00:51:56,605 --> 00:52:04,832
And when I sent the message to the mayor, the mayor told me she wasn't aware of the parking meters going in that far.

640
00:52:05,885 --> 00:52:10,129
Um, at which point, you know, I told her that the gentleman was out there putting heads on the meters then.

641
00:52:10,970 --> 00:52:17,856
And within an hour, she said that, um, they, uh, they finally had called someone to the department.

642
00:52:17,876 --> 00:52:19,458
They stopped and they took the heads out.

643
00:52:19,818 --> 00:52:22,521
But, um, and they did continue to put them on.

644
00:52:22,561 --> 00:52:26,745
But, uh, driving today, I noticed that the polls are still on Boynton Road.

645
00:52:27,305 --> 00:52:28,566
Boynton Road is a residential street.

646
00:52:29,542 --> 00:52:31,023
put meters on residential streets.

647
00:52:32,584 --> 00:52:35,625
I don't know what this department is thinking anymore.

648
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:42,549
Tonight, there's going to be an approved have a party to celebrate this great achievement that we've done here.

649
00:52:44,270 --> 00:52:45,470
I just don't understand it anymore.

650
00:52:46,631 --> 00:52:46,951
Thank you.

651
00:52:47,211 --> 00:52:50,153
Any further comments on this paper?

652
00:52:50,813 --> 00:52:54,595
Yes, Madam President, I just think it's important to point out that, you know,

653
00:52:55,656 --> 00:53:11,809
Back in FY21, when we looked at the $6 million structural deficit that we had, and then again in FY22, when we looked at the $12 million structural deficit that we have in FY23,

654
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:28,526
When we look at the old $700 million or so dollar structural deficit that we have, one of the things that I made very clear during the budget discussions was that we're not going to use the parking program to generate revenues and fill our budget shortfalls.

655
00:53:28,986 --> 00:53:30,708
And I feel like that's what's happening, right?

656
00:53:31,088 --> 00:53:32,189
We're expanding the park.

657
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:35,373
Now, three weeks, three weeks in a row, four weeks in a row, four meetings in a row.

658
00:53:35,893 --> 00:53:45,677
We've had talk about parking right talk about parking talk about failures in the parking department, ticketing people but not supposed to get tickets going down the wrong street and giving everybody on the same street a ticket.

659
00:53:46,338 --> 00:53:53,821
Now the expansion of meters into residential neighborhoods the expansion of meters in front of churches and places of worship and schools and funeral homes.

660
00:53:54,321 --> 00:53:58,443
All right, it seems to me like we're trying to use this parking program to generate revenue.

661
00:53:59,462 --> 00:54:01,043
to address the structural shortfall.

662
00:54:01,124 --> 00:54:16,337
Point of information, correct me if I'm wrong, I believe the conversation we had with the administration was a new growth was 1.8 million and 1.2 was directly from fees and fines of, so I think it's public.

663
00:54:16,397 --> 00:54:22,642
I think that from what we were told back in those meetings that this is a process to

664
00:54:24,023 --> 00:54:27,687
raise revenue for our community, which is disheartening to me, right?

665
00:54:27,907 --> 00:54:28,287
I'm sorry.

666
00:54:28,707 --> 00:54:40,118
And, you know, the packing program when first initiated and first implemented was to turn over spots in the business districts and to enforce residential packing in neighborhoods that were budding public transportation areas.

667
00:54:40,898 --> 00:55:03,714
that's expanded now into ninjas jumping out of trees and giving you tickets on if you're facing the wrong way if you don't have an inspection sticker if you have an expired sticker on your license plate uh you know it's it's getting it's getting a little out of hand yet um we get the residents on brook street that have been never-ending problem that's not going to be rectified anytime soon um parking still comes and gives them tickets um there's really no

668
00:55:08,572 --> 00:55:15,035
And there's been no dynamic amendment of any of these policy decisions that have been made to satisfy any of our constituency.

669
00:55:15,696 --> 00:55:22,659
And it just seems to me like the reoccurring theme, if you agree, it's great, we'll hug.

670
00:55:23,059 --> 00:55:25,600
If you disagree, it's gonna fall on deaf ears and no one's gonna talk to you.

671
00:55:28,682 --> 00:55:29,862
Thank you, Councilor Mayne.

672
00:55:31,023 --> 00:55:34,845
So moving on to our second petition for public participation,

673
00:55:36,492 --> 00:55:39,493
The Honorable City Council, Councillors, the undersigned respectfully pray for.

674
00:55:39,513 --> 00:55:52,995
I would like to talk about the residential parking issues caused on Marion Street with no more residential window stickers being issued, no visitor permits in the windows, out of state plates, and no tickets being issued for any violations to discourage repeated behavior.

675
00:55:53,495 --> 00:56:02,216
How are residents to know who is and is not supposed to be parking on the street without resident decals, petition signature, and T. Campbell, 75 Marion Street.

676
00:56:03,917 --> 00:56:06,177
And again, we have your name and address for the record, so please go ahead.

677
00:56:06,495 --> 00:56:09,916
That would be me, Ann Campbell, 75 Marion Street.

678
00:56:10,336 --> 00:56:14,717
And I have an addendum to the previous statement because I work at St.

679
00:56:14,777 --> 00:56:15,757
Joseph's School.

680
00:56:16,717 --> 00:56:20,238
So I have a little aside to that last issue.

681
00:56:21,418 --> 00:56:29,740
Last spring, I had called the mayor's office and requested a trash barrel be put at the bus stop right in front of St.

682
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:30,700
Joseph's School.

683
00:56:31,490 --> 00:56:39,752
because people that get on the bus right in front of our door can't bring food or drinks on the bus.

684
00:56:40,492 --> 00:56:48,254
So the mayor's office said, oh, well, you'll have to call the DPW to request a trash barrel, which I did.

685
00:56:48,794 --> 00:56:53,056
I called the DPW and I said, we need a trash barrel at the bus stop.

686
00:56:53,116 --> 00:56:54,776
And they said, oh, well, I'm sorry.

687
00:56:55,193 --> 00:56:57,213
You can't have a trash barrel at St.

688
00:56:57,233 --> 00:56:58,174
Joseph school.

689
00:56:58,534 --> 00:57:00,654
You're too far outside the square.

690
00:57:01,074 --> 00:57:03,115
We can't do a trash pickup there.

691
00:57:04,055 --> 00:57:14,237
So we're too far outside the square to get a trash barrel, but we're not too far outside the square to generate tax revenue with a meter.

692
00:57:14,757 --> 00:57:18,938
So that kind of confounded us when we had the meters installed there.

693
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:26,962
So that was just kind of an aside that was a little bit insulting to us last week, but I'll let that one go.

694
00:57:28,542 --> 00:57:30,803
So anyway, my issue was residential.

695
00:57:32,263 --> 00:57:35,844
I live on Marion Street, which I have for 57 years.

696
00:57:37,345 --> 00:57:41,386
We became a residential permit parking street three years ago.

697
00:57:42,866 --> 00:57:49,168
We recently have had a major uptick in people parking on the street without permits.

698
00:57:50,789 --> 00:58:00,255
So I watched the council meeting two weeks ago and Faye Morrison was not able to stay.

699
00:58:00,395 --> 00:58:12,162
So I couldn't ask the question then, but she made a comment that residential stickers for the windshields are no longer being used, which I was not aware of.

700
00:58:12,982 --> 00:58:20,267
And she also said that there's no intention to bring those stickers back, which I also did not know about.

701
00:58:21,577 --> 00:58:28,219
Well, how are we supposed to know who is and who is not supposed to be parking on our street?

702
00:58:29,419 --> 00:58:32,620
You don't know if you don't see the decal in the window.

703
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:40,221
Well, she said, the enforcement scans the parking license plates.

704
00:58:41,082 --> 00:58:47,003
Well, there is no enforcement because I don't see any tickets on any cars on the street.

705
00:58:48,569 --> 00:58:51,211
And I haven't in months and months.

706
00:58:51,591 --> 00:58:55,614
There was the other day for the first time and I can't tell you how long.

707
00:58:56,454 --> 00:59:02,438
Now, when we had Park Medford, I could send an email and they always responded.

708
00:59:02,758 --> 00:59:05,160
They always came down if you sent an email.

709
00:59:06,041 --> 00:59:09,123
I didn't even know who to address things to.

710
00:59:09,563 --> 00:59:15,247
So I went on the website and I found George Bernoski's name.

711
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:18,222
and I found a telephone number.

712
00:59:19,202 --> 00:59:27,128
So I called the phone number listed on the website and it said, one phone number said, we'll call you back as soon as possible.

713
00:59:28,169 --> 00:59:30,891
I got no response back from that phone number.

714
00:59:32,152 --> 00:59:36,736
So I called the other phone number which said, we'll get back to you within 24 to 48 hours.

715
00:59:39,073 --> 00:59:42,675
That was on September 22nd.

716
00:59:42,995 --> 00:59:47,278
I still have not received a phone call back from parking department.

717
00:59:48,619 --> 00:59:54,663
Then I decided to write an email to George Barnosky on September 24th.

718
00:59:55,403 --> 01:00:00,767
I still have not received a response back from George Barnosky to my email.

719
01:00:02,688 --> 01:00:05,750
So I'm getting no response back to my questions.

720
01:00:07,067 --> 01:00:12,510
I'm pretty sure George Bernoski is like the media repairman.

721
01:00:15,452 --> 01:00:18,814
I think his title is like supervisor of media repair or something like that.

722
01:00:18,834 --> 01:00:23,036
I don't think he has any type of function that has to do with the supervision or the issuance of tickets.

723
01:00:23,056 --> 01:00:23,797
I think he's more of a

724
01:00:25,418 --> 01:00:28,600
a meter fixer, oversees the meter repair program.

725
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:37,024
If it's my recollection, I remember when the mayor put out one of her many emails about her new hires that she classified.

726
01:00:37,044 --> 01:00:40,907
There were two names listed on the website for the traffic and parking.

727
01:00:42,087 --> 01:00:44,308
So he was the one I addressed it to.

728
01:00:44,408 --> 01:00:47,650
He didn't answer back.

729
01:00:48,991 --> 01:00:52,073
And there's also a permitted street listing.

730
01:00:53,042 --> 01:00:59,788
Marion Street isn't listed as a permitted street, and we've been permitted for three years.

731
01:01:00,729 --> 01:01:04,212
So possibly that's why we're not getting any enforcement.

732
01:01:04,492 --> 01:01:04,973
I don't know.

733
01:01:05,333 --> 01:01:07,975
How often do they update the website?

734
01:01:08,235 --> 01:01:12,719
I have no idea, but we're not getting enforcement.

735
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:18,845
We have lots of cars that I don't think belong there because none of the neighbors recognize them.

736
01:01:20,154 --> 01:01:24,837
We have no decals in the windows, so we couldn't report them if we wanted to.

737
01:01:25,377 --> 01:01:27,018
What are the neighbors supposed to do?

738
01:01:27,358 --> 01:01:27,878
I don't know.

739
01:01:29,379 --> 01:01:32,481
But there's no intention to bring the decals back.

740
01:01:33,782 --> 01:01:46,749
How are you supposed to know who's supposed to park on a street where the neighbors pay for the decals, pay for the permits to park there, but anybody can park there and they don't have to pay.

741
01:01:47,835 --> 01:01:50,077
So I'm just a little confused by it all.

742
01:01:53,860 --> 01:01:57,643
So I'm just looking for some assistance for myself.

743
01:01:58,063 --> 01:02:09,512
I don't even have to get the decal because I have off the street parking for myself, for my tenants and for the neighbors across the street that don't even have driveway.

744
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:12,835
I let them park in my yard on street sweeping days.

745
01:02:14,266 --> 01:02:16,548
but not everybody has that luxury.

746
01:02:16,968 --> 01:02:24,613
But because I'm the one that requested the permit parking in the first place, I go and I get the stickers.

747
01:02:27,455 --> 01:02:30,677
But it's not working anymore.

748
01:02:31,037 --> 01:02:33,239
It used to work, but it doesn't work anymore.

749
01:02:33,259 --> 01:02:34,820
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

750
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:35,640
Thank you.

751
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:36,921
Thank you for coming out.

752
01:02:37,561 --> 01:02:39,363
But I sense your frustration.

753
01:02:41,234 --> 01:02:47,937
since our last meeting, talking about traffic and parking since we had the director on for a half hour to answer questions.

754
01:02:48,558 --> 01:02:50,899
We've had about 30 phone calls and emails.

755
01:02:50,999 --> 01:02:51,779
People have called me.

756
01:02:52,420 --> 01:03:02,545
One thing we've recommended that maybe we stop, we reset, we educate both the enforcement officers and the community.

757
01:03:02,805 --> 01:03:04,666
I think that that's what

758
01:03:07,096 --> 01:03:16,564
a responsible community does when you're unveiling such a huge, impactful scenario like traffic enforcement.

759
01:03:17,305 --> 01:03:20,826
Um, to say that we don't need the sticker anymore.

760
01:03:20,866 --> 01:03:23,927
These are questions we had to ask, too, and we were cut short, too.

761
01:03:23,967 --> 01:03:26,267
We didn't realize I know that Councilor Morrell did.

762
01:03:26,687 --> 01:03:32,629
President Morrell did a great job even getting the director here just for, you know, a half hour.

763
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:36,810
And we were told what before the meeting that she was leaving at seven.

764
01:03:37,690 --> 01:03:46,056
And after her 30-minute presentation of a presentation she sent us, and then listening to just a few people, there's so many questions still need to be answered.

765
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:52,860
This is frustrating for everyone, yourself, us, because we don't know what to tell you.

766
01:03:53,180 --> 01:03:54,301
That's what the sad piece is.

767
01:03:57,163 --> 01:04:01,686
And I don't blame the traffic enforcement officers that they hired, because it's not their fault either.

768
01:04:02,401 --> 01:04:13,910
You know, when you have three people on the road in the city that met with size and they added all of these residential streets and sidewalks and streets and roadways and said, okay, now let's police those areas.

769
01:04:14,590 --> 01:04:18,433
It's impossible to get to Marion street in a daily basis, let alone a weekly basis.

770
01:04:18,933 --> 01:04:20,935
So maybe it is wrong.

771
01:04:20,975 --> 01:04:21,775
Maybe they don't have it.

772
01:04:22,256 --> 01:04:26,179
We had a resident come up and tell us that they ticketed 40 tickets on one street.

773
01:04:26,899 --> 01:04:29,121
And when they asked the question of what problem was,

774
01:04:30,447 --> 01:04:31,488
They gave them the wrong street.

775
01:04:31,528 --> 01:04:33,530
They weren't even on their street.

776
01:04:34,290 --> 01:04:37,593
They named a street that has a car wash on it and that's it.

777
01:04:38,614 --> 01:04:40,156
So that just tells you the frustration.

778
01:04:41,217 --> 01:04:53,007
And I know I get a phone call from a resident said that they were actually, they were enlightened that the enforcement officer came down the street and gave warnings.

779
01:04:54,011 --> 01:05:02,258
We asked, instead of giving the ticket, why don't you just give a warning so they can, the residents can be proactive and correct the situation.

780
01:05:02,858 --> 01:05:10,144
And the director, I believe the director said what, that the dogs would attack them if they get out of the car and gave a warning.

781
01:05:11,085 --> 01:05:14,347
I guess that dogs are very scared of tickets, just like us.

782
01:05:14,748 --> 01:05:18,050
So they won't attack with the tickets, but with the warning, they won't.

783
01:05:19,756 --> 01:05:26,983
The resident called me, said he had a conversation with the gentleman that came out and said, well, the director said that she was not going to give warnings.

784
01:05:28,064 --> 01:05:29,325
And they said, that's not true.

785
01:05:29,565 --> 01:05:34,770
And we were all in the meeting saying, I'm a little confused because the dog doesn't know how to wag the tail.

786
01:05:35,030 --> 01:05:36,592
So it's getting frustrating.

787
01:05:37,478 --> 01:05:50,242
So, and again, I will call, I would love to call another meeting, a Committee of the Whole meeting where we bring city administration, a traffic enforcement director back out in front of us to answer some of these questions that still have yet to be answered.

788
01:05:51,002 --> 01:05:53,143
And, you know, the situation at St.

789
01:05:53,183 --> 01:06:00,965
Joe's, if it wasn't for Ricky's phone call and reaching out and getting everybody involved, they'd be meters there.

790
01:06:02,611 --> 01:06:03,792
and people be getting ticket and towed.

791
01:06:04,552 --> 01:06:07,313
So there's a lot of questions still have to be answered.

792
01:06:07,333 --> 01:06:11,055
There's a lot of concerns in this community about a traffic program.

793
01:06:11,095 --> 01:06:13,036
So I apologize.

794
01:06:13,056 --> 01:06:14,276
I wish I had an answer for you.

795
01:06:15,257 --> 01:06:17,057
My recommendation again would be to,

796
01:06:19,081 --> 01:06:30,585
review, do an audit of all of these concerns that we have with our residents, with the director and her team, to see what we can do to mitigate any future concerns.

797
01:06:30,645 --> 01:06:36,747
Because I can't imagine how bad this is going to be once we have to park on one side of the street or the other.

798
01:06:37,488 --> 01:06:39,828
And how are they going to enforce this?

799
01:06:40,509 --> 01:06:42,649
It's going to be a real scary winter.

800
01:06:44,410 --> 01:06:46,411
You know, this is just a prelude to what we're seeing.

801
01:06:46,492 --> 01:06:49,133
So again, I wish we could do more.

802
01:06:49,734 --> 01:06:50,755
We feel your frustration.

803
01:06:52,276 --> 01:07:01,983
But again, all we can do is, you know, maybe ask for another meeting with the director, because it seems to be that that's the only person that can answer our questions.

804
01:07:03,964 --> 01:07:05,445
And a half an hour wasn't enough.

805
01:07:05,565 --> 01:07:06,045
No, it wasn't.

806
01:07:06,065 --> 01:07:06,445
I agree.

807
01:07:06,766 --> 01:07:07,686
And we told them that.

808
01:07:08,267 --> 01:07:12,509
And Council President worked her tail off just to make sure that she was here.

809
01:07:12,589 --> 01:07:20,413
So it floored us when we heard that we have a half hour and there were 30 people waiting to talk about some, you know, just to get an answer, just like you did.

810
01:07:20,714 --> 01:07:20,834
So.

811
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:24,001
And unfortunately, you're here today to express that question.

812
01:07:24,521 --> 01:07:32,484
And we can't really give you the answer that good or bad, because at least we can have closure if there was someone that could give us something.

813
01:07:32,504 --> 01:07:34,905
And I don't have much faith you get that phone call, by the way.

814
01:07:35,466 --> 01:07:36,126
I apologize for that.

815
01:07:36,146 --> 01:07:36,886
No, I noticed that.

816
01:07:37,006 --> 01:07:45,890
But I would really try to call the communications department, the mayor's office, chief of staff, and ask their guidance on who you should call, because you've obviously tried the numbers that were there.

817
01:07:46,670 --> 01:07:49,032
So that would be my recommendation.

818
01:07:49,052 --> 01:07:49,812
All right.

819
01:07:49,932 --> 01:07:50,212
Thank you.

820
01:07:50,232 --> 01:07:50,472
I'm sorry.

821
01:07:50,493 --> 01:07:51,473
Thank you for listening.

822
01:07:51,513 --> 01:07:52,594
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

823
01:07:52,634 --> 01:07:54,515
Going to Councilor Kalas and Vice Mayor Behrs.

824
01:07:55,816 --> 01:07:56,756
Thank you, President Merlin.

825
01:07:57,057 --> 01:07:57,497
Thank you, Ms.

826
01:07:57,517 --> 01:08:04,361
Campbell, for being here tonight and to the other residents that are speaking about their experiences with parking.

827
01:08:05,682 --> 01:08:07,023
The last time we spoke about this,

828
01:08:09,399 --> 01:08:11,480
Yeah, I know, I'm like, what instance was it?

829
01:08:12,201 --> 01:08:30,453
I made the comment, I think something along the lines of, you know, wondering because of the volume of complaints that we've been getting about residents' experience with parking and also complaints from within the parking department itself, from the rank and file and from the leadership wondering, was this department set up to succeed or was it set up to fail?

830
01:08:30,513 --> 01:08:35,856
And listening to, you know, the resident experience,

831
01:08:39,306 --> 01:08:42,289
you know, the new parking rules as they're filtering through the residence experience.

832
01:08:43,910 --> 01:08:51,838
It strikes me that, you know, something that my dad used to tell me about writing is, you know, you can't brainstorm and edit at the same time.

833
01:08:51,878 --> 01:08:53,280
You can't write and edit at the same time.

834
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:58,925
And I know from conversations with director Morrison that there's, sorry, this whole circus going on over here.

835
01:08:58,945 --> 01:08:59,866
I'm a little distracted.

836
01:08:59,886 --> 01:09:00,767
I don't know what's going on.

837
01:09:02,124 --> 01:09:03,865
And also, my advice was embarrassed.

838
01:09:03,965 --> 01:09:07,447
I'm rapidly losing my voice, so I apologize for continued distractions.

839
01:09:07,687 --> 01:09:08,047
That's okay.

840
01:09:09,248 --> 01:09:10,829
You know, you can't write and edit at the same time.

841
01:09:10,889 --> 01:09:21,314
And I know that it's a huge mantle to spin up a whole new city department from nothing, you know, from a contractor that I think, you know, a lot of sources have said was mismanaging our parking system in the city beforehand.

842
01:09:22,015 --> 01:09:26,117
But it brings me back to that same question about was this department set up to succeed?

843
01:09:26,717 --> 01:09:27,598
Was it set up to fail?

844
01:09:28,518 --> 01:09:31,020
Is it even conceivable that a project of this scale

845
01:09:31,620 --> 01:09:39,984
could be started and refined and take back resident feedback and be guided and be modifying what it's doing all at the same time.

846
01:09:40,024 --> 01:09:44,487
And it seems like that isn't really happening based on what we're hearing from residents.

847
01:09:46,468 --> 01:09:53,371
And I know that, you know, it's our parking department staff that's executing the work on a daily basis.

848
01:09:54,612 --> 01:09:59,875
But, you know, we get very strong city communications about certain topics from our city administration.

849
01:10:00,915 --> 01:10:05,756
about certain types of events and certain types of updates and certain types of developments in the community.

850
01:10:06,596 --> 01:10:16,259
And, you know, I'm really upset about the adverse effects of the new parking program on residents when they've been burdened by this and when they felt unheard.

851
01:10:17,179 --> 01:10:21,220
But I'm also upset that the city administration isn't stepping up and taking more of the

852
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:28,062
of the Brunton more the responsibility for directing this, um, in the way that I think it's their responsibility to do so.

853
01:10:29,182 --> 01:10:35,023
And so you know, we seem to have a great capacity for communicating about certain types of developments and certain types of updates in the city.

854
01:10:35,643 --> 01:10:45,486
And I think I think we're past due for seeing more of that capacity spread to the parking department, not just that it's more fair to the rank and file parking staff, the ones that are charged with just executing.

855
01:10:46,266 --> 01:10:53,548
the protocols, but also for the benefit of the residents who months later are still struggling to stay up to date with what's already been said about what we can expect.

856
01:10:53,728 --> 01:10:54,588
Why is this happening?

857
01:10:54,628 --> 01:10:55,448
When is it going to change?

858
01:10:55,548 --> 01:10:56,309
Is it going to change?

859
01:10:57,329 --> 01:10:57,629
Thank you.

860
01:10:59,309 --> 01:11:00,310
Thank you, Councilor Collins.

861
01:11:02,190 --> 01:11:02,770
Councilor Kerrio.

862
01:11:04,491 --> 01:11:06,111
Thank you, Mr. President.

863
01:11:06,131 --> 01:11:11,233
Councilor Collins made a point, but was this program set up to fail?

864
01:11:11,573 --> 01:11:12,193
It probably was.

865
01:11:12,875 --> 01:11:22,864
You know, you open a department of this size, and the administration touted, what a great job did they get it up and running in such a short period of time.

866
01:11:22,884 --> 01:11:26,247
Well, it wasn't a great job getting done in a short period of time.

867
01:11:26,287 --> 01:11:31,051
The program needed more time to be refined and figured out what had to be done.

868
01:11:31,512 --> 01:11:37,137
Again, for the members who weren't here, when Park Metro came in, Park Metro came in at a bad time.

869
01:11:37,177 --> 01:11:38,458
They realized they made mistakes.

870
01:11:38,998 --> 01:11:39,479
They stopped.

871
01:11:40,844 --> 01:11:48,290
They took three, four more months and figured out what they were doing wrong, what was wrong, and they fixed it and rolled the program out again.

872
01:11:49,090 --> 01:11:53,914
This program doesn't want to admit that it's made any mistakes.

873
01:11:55,035 --> 01:11:56,796
And it's made many mistakes.

874
01:11:56,936 --> 01:11:58,798
One of the questions I wanted to ask last week was,

875
01:12:00,082 --> 01:12:12,307
When they were ticketing all the streets, all the cars on the streets with wrong addresses, what about all the people who just didn't have the time to appeal to them and they just say, hey, I'll pay the $25 because I don't have time to go to registry.

876
01:12:12,327 --> 01:12:15,729
I don't have the time to say, hey, maybe I was wrong and just pay the $25.

877
01:12:15,769 --> 01:12:18,090
Are any of those people getting their money back?

878
01:12:19,070 --> 01:12:20,631
No idea, no idea.

879
01:12:21,031 --> 01:12:25,873
And again, you know, like I said, calls are still coming in all over the place from all different parts of the city.

880
01:12:26,971 --> 01:12:37,539
And again, it's a program that was put out with a bum's rush and instead of the thought that it took to put the, especially with the meters.

881
01:12:38,239 --> 01:12:44,884
Well, it was a bit, at the end of the day, when it was all done, the answer that came back was, it was a miscommunication.

882
01:12:47,162 --> 01:12:48,223
another miscommunication.

883
01:12:48,243 --> 01:12:49,743
There's been a lot of miscommunications.

884
01:12:50,524 --> 01:12:52,345
Again, Councilor Scott is right.

885
01:12:52,425 --> 01:12:54,986
We made a motion a couple of weeks ago.

886
01:12:55,626 --> 01:13:00,429
Stop ticketing people until you figure out that we're doing it right.

887
01:13:00,689 --> 01:13:02,010
Let's get the program fixed.

888
01:13:02,390 --> 01:13:04,191
Don't keep going in a bad direction.

889
01:13:07,432 --> 01:13:10,754
Sheila's on Marion Street, which is a pretty crowded street.

890
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:13,996
I grew up on William Street, which was the next street.

891
01:13:14,676 --> 01:13:16,377
Wait till the train station comes in over there.

892
01:13:18,589 --> 01:13:23,292
She's within walking distance of the ball street, of the ball square station.

893
01:13:23,312 --> 01:13:25,474
What do you think, people aren't gonna be parking in our neighborhood then?

894
01:13:25,874 --> 01:13:28,475
All over Winchester Street and all those surrounding streets?

895
01:13:29,636 --> 01:13:35,440
There's not even any talk about that when that station opens up, coming down the line.

896
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:38,882
And nevermind about the station at Tufts.

897
01:13:39,903 --> 01:13:46,729
all those hillside streets are gonna be, and all those streets down in College Ave are gonna be people walking, parking the cars and walking.

898
01:13:46,749 --> 01:13:48,530
There's no talk about doing anything over there.

899
01:13:48,851 --> 01:13:58,379
So again, I think it's time that we stop, that this program stop and reassess and figure out what is doing wrong and let's figure it out and do it right.

900
01:14:01,121 --> 01:14:01,962
Thank you, Councilor Kerrio.

901
01:14:02,042 --> 01:14:05,665
I mean, sorry.

902
01:14:09,502 --> 01:14:10,202
No, I still have.

903
01:14:10,222 --> 01:14:11,723
There's still another.

904
01:14:12,623 --> 01:14:16,145
If I may, from the chair, just add a couple of things.

905
01:14:16,365 --> 01:14:19,686
One is that I can't remember when we filed.

906
01:14:19,786 --> 01:14:27,729
I filed it or we passed it, but we have requested that the traffic and parking decisions and rules and regulations actually be posted on the city website.

907
01:14:27,789 --> 01:14:30,630
They're currently not, which would be helpful.

908
01:14:31,151 --> 01:14:34,732
And then as pertains to these specific issues, if possible, Mr. Clerk, if you

909
01:14:39,736 --> 01:14:42,839
I think that maybe we'll get an answer since you haven't received a response.

910
01:14:42,879 --> 01:14:44,080
Maybe we will get one faster.

911
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:50,366
But that's just something I was going to say before I came up to be the chair.

912
01:14:52,187 --> 01:14:52,708
President Morales.

913
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:55,901
I'll be brief because I don't really have a voice, but I also do just have concerns.

914
01:14:56,161 --> 01:15:00,483
I mean, things like putting in meter heads that need to be immediately removed, that costs money.

915
01:15:00,563 --> 01:15:01,963
What kind of money are we losing?

916
01:15:02,023 --> 01:15:03,344
I mean, these are costly mistakes.

917
01:15:03,984 --> 01:15:09,246
At a department that I understand needs a certain amount of funding to get up and running, but this is stuff that's easily avoided.

918
01:15:09,306 --> 01:15:11,367
So that just gives me great pause.

919
01:15:17,409 --> 01:15:18,730
Any further discussion on this petition?

920
01:15:20,434 --> 01:15:23,575
Any other folks who'd like to speak public participation is open.

921
01:15:23,615 --> 01:15:26,775
Please come to the podium.

922
01:15:30,616 --> 01:15:31,597
Yeah.

923
01:15:34,117 --> 01:15:36,058
Read about how we won 35 High Street.

924
01:15:36,758 --> 01:15:41,919
The day that I put the meters and after I spoke to Mr Cabrillo, I called mayor's office.

925
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:46,660
I called parking, um, talking director and, um,

926
01:15:47,776 --> 01:15:58,004
I went to Miss Morrison's office and someone from her office called and said that it was not the jurisdiction that I needed to call Chief Buckley, that it was traffic.

927
01:15:58,765 --> 01:16:04,669
So I called traffic and they weren't aware that there were any meters installed anywhere in the city.

928
01:16:05,590 --> 01:16:10,874
And they said that it was not the jurisdiction that it belonged back over to the parking.

929
01:16:11,735 --> 01:16:15,858
So I called parking back and told them, you know, you're probably going to get a lot of phone calls because

930
01:16:16,487 --> 01:16:20,049
You're telling people to go to traffic and traffic is telling them to come back to you.

931
01:16:20,930 --> 01:16:30,135
I called the mayor's office and I did get a response from her administrator that said that they weren't aware of the meters either.

932
01:16:31,116 --> 01:16:33,817
And my thing is somebody had to authorize it.

933
01:16:34,318 --> 01:16:36,659
Somebody had to sign an expenditure to pay for it.

934
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:39,261
And nobody knows what's going on.

935
01:16:40,061 --> 01:16:41,662
And nobody wants to take ownership for it.

936
01:16:42,609 --> 01:16:45,850
And for myself with a meter in front of my house, it's awful.

937
01:16:46,510 --> 01:16:51,931
And it's also, I'm not thinking of selling my house, but if I were, who's gonna buy a house with a meter in front of it?

938
01:16:52,372 --> 01:16:53,212
I certainly wouldn't.

939
01:16:54,392 --> 01:17:03,914
So between the church and private residents and nobody knows what's going on and wants to take ownership for it, it's just crazy.

940
01:17:04,855 --> 01:17:09,716
So somebody had to sign to pay for people to come out, to put the poles in,

941
01:17:11,849 --> 01:17:15,152
to pay for the man that was out there ready to install the meters.

942
01:17:17,134 --> 01:17:17,475
I don't know.

943
01:17:17,535 --> 01:17:18,996
It just doesn't make sense.

944
01:17:19,657 --> 01:17:19,937
Thank you.

945
01:17:20,257 --> 01:17:28,625
I can tell you for a fact that the mayor is the person who signed off on it because there was an ARPA expenditure that basically we're using federal ARPA funds to fund this meter project.

946
01:17:28,705 --> 01:17:32,849
And she's decided that the council has no involvement in how those funds are going to be expended.

947
01:17:32,909 --> 01:17:35,932
So if it was approved, it was approved by the mayor.

948
01:17:36,918 --> 01:17:40,862
And for us, parking is a big deal because High Street's a busy street.

949
01:17:40,902 --> 01:17:42,343
We have the library right next to us.

950
01:17:42,363 --> 01:17:43,705
We have the church across the street from us.

951
01:17:44,225 --> 01:17:45,887
We have to deal with snow emergency.

952
01:17:46,847 --> 01:17:49,930
So we have to get our cars off the street when there's a snow emergency.

953
01:17:50,010 --> 01:17:56,977
So technically we can park on Boynton, but even at that, we have two apartment buildings on High Street too.

954
01:17:57,317 --> 01:18:00,640
There's just way too many cars and not enough places to put them.

955
01:18:01,242 --> 01:18:06,224
So last winter, and I've lived in my house for 38 years, so I'm not new to the neighborhood.

956
01:18:06,264 --> 01:18:07,644
I've lived in Medford all my life.

957
01:18:08,404 --> 01:18:14,666
And so a couple of the snow storms, you know, we parked on Boynton, people were parked on both sides.

958
01:18:15,226 --> 01:18:24,869
No one got ticketed, nothing happened, even though there's just the parking on one side, but the parking is so very limited that people were parked there, so we parked there.

959
01:18:25,129 --> 01:18:25,769
Nothing happened.

960
01:18:25,789 --> 01:18:27,190
First snow storm, nothing happened.

961
01:18:27,210 --> 01:18:28,070
Second snow storm,

962
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:36,834
Third snow emergency, everybody was parked on both sides and all of a sudden we go out in the morning, cars are towed, they're ticketed.

963
01:18:36,854 --> 01:18:39,375
There's just no consistency.

964
01:18:39,895 --> 01:18:42,596
You can do it one time and nothing happens.

965
01:18:42,636 --> 01:18:45,878
You do it the next time and your car's towed and you're ticketed.

966
01:18:47,238 --> 01:18:52,621
So I don't think anybody knows what's going on with our traffic and parking at this point.

967
01:18:53,221 --> 01:18:57,643
At least before you knew, okay, this year you park on that side, next year you park on another side.

968
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:00,241
but you don't know what to do anymore.

969
01:19:01,601 --> 01:19:03,122
So that's my two cents.

970
01:19:04,483 --> 01:19:04,843
Thank you.

971
01:19:05,023 --> 01:19:05,723
Thank you Sarita.

972
01:19:05,743 --> 01:19:06,684
Councilor Carviello.

973
01:19:06,704 --> 01:19:07,344
Thank you, Mr. President.

974
01:19:09,025 --> 01:19:20,790
I'd like to get a cost on, what a cost to put in all those poles, those extra poles that weren't necessary, the cost of removing them, and we bought meter heads for all those extra poles.

975
01:19:21,530 --> 01:19:25,492
Where are all those meter heads now that aren't going on, that we're planning on going on?

976
01:19:27,167 --> 01:19:29,167
Are the poles going to be removed from Boynton Road?

977
01:19:29,648 --> 01:19:33,709
There's still meter poles on Boynton Road on both sides.

978
01:19:34,149 --> 01:19:35,829
Are those going to be taken out?

979
01:19:36,129 --> 01:19:37,549
How much did it cost that we put them in?

980
01:19:37,890 --> 01:19:45,651
How many extra meterheads did we buy that we were probably another 30 more meterheads that we probably didn't have to buy because we didn't need them all.

981
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:50,412
So I'd like to make that in the form of a motion.

982
01:19:54,269 --> 01:19:57,190
could we do it as a resolution next week?

983
01:19:57,210 --> 01:19:58,971
We'll do it on the ice cream truck.

984
01:19:58,991 --> 01:19:59,951
We'll do it on the ice cream truck.

985
01:19:59,971 --> 01:20:01,272
There are other items on parking.

986
01:20:01,292 --> 01:20:08,315
We'll hold it later, but that's a concern of mine, how much money we spent on all those extra meat heads, installing those poles and taking the poles out.

987
01:20:08,855 --> 01:20:09,175
Ian.

988
01:20:09,396 --> 01:20:12,377
There's a couple more items on parking that we can attach it to later in the meeting.

989
01:20:14,998 --> 01:20:17,819
All right, those were the two public participation.

990
01:20:17,839 --> 01:20:19,280
We do have community participation.

991
01:20:19,340 --> 01:20:19,940
I have a source.

992
01:20:20,660 --> 01:20:22,481
I know we have a resident that wants to come up and speak.

993
01:20:24,764 --> 01:20:30,410
Again, this is public participation on any topic if you could just have your name and address for the record please.

994
01:20:30,430 --> 01:20:32,752
Mark Chubbs, 356 Winthrop Street.

995
01:20:33,112 --> 01:20:34,814
I've owned the property there for over 40 years.

996
01:20:34,834 --> 01:20:36,315
I'm a lifetime resident of Medford.

997
01:20:36,436 --> 01:20:38,578
My family's been in Medford for over 150 years.

998
01:20:39,138 --> 01:20:40,520
Very proud to be a Medford resident.

999
01:20:40,900 --> 01:20:42,221
Thank you, City Council, for your time.

1000
01:20:43,382 --> 01:20:49,028
My house is directly in front of the Eversource Movement to Everett project, which I supported a few years ago and I still support it.

1001
01:20:50,090 --> 01:20:53,873
I came before the council a couple of years ago, and then first developer tried to push the project through.

1002
01:20:54,293 --> 01:20:56,795
I'm recently retired from the utility construction industry.

1003
01:20:57,315 --> 01:20:59,376
I firmly support infrastructure upgrades.

1004
01:20:59,677 --> 01:21:00,357
Country needs it.

1005
01:21:01,498 --> 01:21:07,062
Medford Police Department has been fantastic with traffic enforcement, directing traffic, helping us in and out of our driveways.

1006
01:21:07,602 --> 01:21:10,164
McCourt Construction Company has done a fantastic job.

1007
01:21:10,604 --> 01:21:14,347
When they leave their jobs Saturday night, there's not one stitch of trash on that road.

1008
01:21:14,887 --> 01:21:15,487
My issue is,

1009
01:21:16,420 --> 01:21:20,202
We've been annihilated with a rodent problem since that street was dug up.

1010
01:21:21,042 --> 01:21:24,424
I put three calls into Eversource, have not received any phone calls back.

1011
01:21:24,944 --> 01:21:26,065
I did not speak to McCourt.

1012
01:21:26,745 --> 01:21:29,887
I felt that the chain of command would be to go to Eversource first.

1013
01:21:30,527 --> 01:21:33,369
I spoke to some of the city councilors here and this is the direction I'm going in.

1014
01:21:33,669 --> 01:21:37,351
But again, the Medford Police Department has been phenomenal with moving traffic.

1015
01:21:37,511 --> 01:21:38,391
It's a very busy street.

1016
01:21:38,411 --> 01:21:39,492
It's a very busy intersection.

1017
01:21:40,072 --> 01:21:42,674
And the contractors have been very, very helpful, McCourt.

1018
01:21:43,625 --> 01:21:48,395
just want to bring that to the attention of the city council that there isn't houses I've had to hire on.

1019
01:21:49,278 --> 01:21:51,920
a pesticide company and we have traps everywhere.

1020
01:21:51,940 --> 01:21:55,161
I have three small grandchildren, small pets, so I'm concerned.

1021
01:21:55,562 --> 01:21:56,202
Thank you for your time.

1022
01:21:56,422 --> 01:21:57,623
Thank you for bringing that up.

1023
01:21:57,903 --> 01:22:01,585
I know that there should be rodent control mitigation, so I'll go to Councillor Scarpelli on that.

1024
01:22:01,625 --> 01:22:09,830
No, I think that that's whenever we're doing, we made sure, especially with the problems we've had with the rodents, that there should be some mitigation in the agreement.

1025
01:22:09,870 --> 01:22:13,532
So unfortunately, we can't do it because of public participation, but

1026
01:22:14,032 --> 01:22:36,301
we could do is file a resolution next week to have all the city departments, the health commissioner and our city engineer that oversees the project to look into making sure that there's some whatever's in place needs to be in place and then and shared with the council so we can get back to you and your neighbors so they they can know something's being done.

1027
01:22:36,361 --> 01:22:36,601
So I

1028
01:22:37,982 --> 01:22:56,852
again especially when you do we talked about this whenever the roads are being open we know that we're going to have uh a manifestation of rodents and that's why we made sure we put those uh those those uh plans in place to mitigate that so hopefully we can remedy that for you but thanks for coming up and sharing that Mr. Chubbs.

1029
01:22:57,372 --> 01:22:57,632
Thank you.

1030
01:22:58,793 --> 01:22:59,873
Thank you Councilor Scarpaio.

1031
01:22:59,893 --> 01:23:00,393
President Morales.

1032
01:23:00,754 --> 01:23:01,694
Thank you Vice President Fares.

1033
01:23:01,714 --> 01:23:05,136
Yeah and I was speaking with Mr. Chubbs earlier that I did reach out to the um

1034
01:23:05,958 --> 01:23:11,543
director of the Board of Health because we this council did pass an updated ordinance related to pest management.

1035
01:23:12,123 --> 01:23:27,877
And part of that does call for an integrated pest management plan from anyone doing large construction street opening projects and I would just, you know, at the next meeting I'd be curious to know from the director of the Board of Health programs like ever source that were negotiated, you know, seven years ago at this point.

1036
01:23:28,456 --> 01:23:38,841
and this is a recent update to the ordinance, are they something that they automatically opt in or do they exist in this gray space because these projects were negotiated so far back?

1037
01:23:38,921 --> 01:23:44,223
So just kind of saying it out loud, noting to myself when this comes up on the regular agenda.

1038
01:23:44,243 --> 01:23:46,144
So thank you for coming out once more.

1039
01:23:47,704 --> 01:23:52,486
We don't have Larry tonight, but someone could write something up on paper and grab signatures.

1040
01:23:52,526 --> 01:23:53,727
We can do it under suspension tonight.

1041
01:23:55,965 --> 01:23:56,165
Sure.

1042
01:23:56,445 --> 01:23:59,106
If you want, I'd ask Larry to pass it around.

1043
01:23:59,606 --> 01:23:59,927
Larry?

1044
01:23:59,947 --> 01:24:02,388
Well, wait a second.

1045
01:24:02,428 --> 01:24:03,668
Maybe something will come out of the sky.

1046
01:24:09,751 --> 01:24:10,511
Yeah, I mean.

1047
01:24:11,111 --> 01:24:12,452
So we can do it next week.

1048
01:24:12,512 --> 01:24:13,572
All right, that's fine.

1049
01:24:14,692 --> 01:24:15,093
That's fine.

1050
01:24:15,193 --> 01:24:16,133
Okay, we can do it next week.

1051
01:24:16,233 --> 01:24:17,794
And I did already reach out to the director.

1052
01:24:17,934 --> 01:24:18,854
Right, we'll follow up.

1053
01:24:19,154 --> 01:24:20,495
We'll put a resolution on it and we'll follow up.

1054
01:24:20,515 --> 01:24:20,735
Okay.

1055
01:24:21,765 --> 01:24:22,906
We're still under suspension.

1056
01:24:23,406 --> 01:24:25,106
We're still in public participation.

1057
01:24:25,226 --> 01:24:30,748
Any further public participation from members in the chamber from residents in the chamber or anyone on zoom?

1058
01:24:30,768 --> 01:24:32,789
Do we have any hands raised for public participation?

1059
01:24:36,010 --> 01:24:37,311
Seeing none, any motions on the floor?

1060
01:24:38,271 --> 01:24:40,512
I know I still have one on the on the suspension.

1061
01:24:40,792 --> 01:24:43,273
Yeah, I know that we have our director here that

1062
01:24:45,421 --> 01:24:49,962
under unfinished business 22-466 our loan order for water meters.

1063
01:24:50,382 --> 01:24:51,702
I know it's up for its third reading.

1064
01:24:51,742 --> 01:24:53,483
So if we can move that along.

1065
01:24:53,543 --> 01:24:59,004
So paper 22-466 loan order water meters.

1066
01:24:59,284 --> 01:25:01,945
We pass this for first reading on September 13th.

1067
01:25:01,985 --> 01:25:08,066
It went out for its second reading and the transcript advertised September 29th and it's eligible for third reading tonight, October 11th.

1068
01:25:09,595 --> 01:25:13,316
This is the project to update all of the water meters.

1069
01:25:13,536 --> 01:25:13,856
Second.

1070
01:25:14,456 --> 01:25:19,097
On councilor's motion to approve 22-466 for third reading, seconded by.

1071
01:25:19,377 --> 01:25:19,697
Second.

1072
01:25:20,357 --> 01:25:21,417
Seconded by councilor Scarpelli.

1073
01:25:21,437 --> 01:25:22,777
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1074
01:25:22,797 --> 01:25:31,079
Yes.

1075
01:25:31,119 --> 01:25:31,399
Yes.

1076
01:25:31,719 --> 01:25:31,999
Yes.

1077
01:25:33,839 --> 01:25:33,999
Yes.

1078
01:25:39,888 --> 01:25:40,108
Yes.

1079
01:25:41,289 --> 01:25:42,970
Yes, I'm in the affirmative, none in the negative.

1080
01:25:43,210 --> 01:25:45,932
Motion passes and loan order is approved for third reading.

1081
01:25:46,052 --> 01:25:46,513
Thank you.

1082
01:25:47,854 --> 01:25:48,674
Any motions on the floor?

1083
01:25:49,515 --> 01:25:55,719
We have anyone from National Grid?

1084
01:25:56,520 --> 01:25:56,760
Yes.

1085
01:26:01,363 --> 01:26:03,125
Motion of Councillor Knight to take paper 22-505.

1086
01:26:03,685 --> 01:26:07,488
It's on a motion, we're under suspension, so.

1087
01:26:08,388 --> 01:26:11,951
22-505 legal notice petition for grant of location, National Grid, Inc.

1088
01:26:12,011 --> 01:26:13,292
of North Andover, Massachusetts.

1089
01:26:14,553 --> 01:26:19,597
You are hereby notified that by order of the... Great.

1090
01:26:19,797 --> 01:26:23,781
We could motion that we have the petitioner give a brief synopsis.

1091
01:26:23,821 --> 01:26:28,805
Motion to waive the reading for a short synopsis by the petitioner of Councilor Scarapelli, seconded by Councilor Sang.

1092
01:26:28,825 --> 01:26:29,425
All those in favor?

1093
01:26:29,445 --> 01:26:29,986
Aye.

1094
01:26:30,266 --> 01:26:30,706
Opposed?

1095
01:26:30,806 --> 01:26:31,727
Motion passes.

1096
01:26:31,747 --> 01:26:35,230
If you could recognize our representative from National Grid, Mr. Clerk.

1097
01:26:39,984 --> 01:26:40,424
Good evening.

1098
01:26:40,604 --> 01:26:44,526
My name is Diana Cuddy from National Grid 40 Sylvan Road, Waltham, Massachusetts.

1099
01:26:45,046 --> 01:26:51,489
I'm here requesting a grant location for main replacement project due to water work by the city of Medford.

1100
01:26:52,289 --> 01:26:57,831
We needed to relocate part of Medford, Walnut Street and Medford Street.

1101
01:26:58,231 --> 01:27:02,113
So it's about 730 feet of pipe that will be

1102
01:27:02,773 --> 01:27:09,959
relocated on Walnut Street and 690 feet of height that will be relocated on Metcalfe Street.

1103
01:27:14,783 --> 01:27:15,203
Councilor Nye.

1104
01:27:16,384 --> 01:27:21,428
Council request that pavement restoration be done in a curb-to-curb fashion.

1105
01:27:25,731 --> 01:27:26,512
Oh, sorry.

1106
01:27:27,512 --> 01:27:28,493
Hold on a minute.

1107
01:27:28,513 --> 01:27:30,635
I have to open the public hearing before we open.

1108
01:27:33,268 --> 01:27:33,528
Okay.

1109
01:27:34,348 --> 01:27:35,468
Well, I mean, it's a question.

1110
01:27:36,289 --> 01:27:38,829
I have to open the public hearing before we answer questions, sorry.

1111
01:27:40,289 --> 01:27:41,950
Public hearing is now open.

1112
01:27:44,830 --> 01:27:45,950
People in favor of the petition.

1113
01:27:45,970 --> 01:27:49,051
Is there anyone here in favor of the petition?

1114
01:27:49,131 --> 01:27:50,871
Please give your name and address for the record.

1115
01:27:50,891 --> 01:27:53,772
That'll be you, Diana.

1116
01:27:54,192 --> 01:27:58,612
Yes, I am Diana Cuddy, National Grid 40 Sylvan Road, Waltham, Massachusetts.

1117
01:27:59,713 --> 01:28:01,393
Anyone else here in favor of the petition?

1118
01:28:03,248 --> 01:28:05,109
Seeing none, this portion of the hearing is closed.

1119
01:28:06,069 --> 01:28:08,390
Anyone here in opposition to the petition?

1120
01:28:12,991 --> 01:28:14,812
Seeing none, this portion of the hearing is closed.

1121
01:28:16,373 --> 01:28:16,893
Councilor Knight.

1122
01:28:17,653 --> 01:28:20,334
So it says that this is a, what, a replacement project?

1123
01:28:20,834 --> 01:28:21,775
A relocation project?

1124
01:28:21,795 --> 01:28:24,275
They're relocating the gas main on Walnut Street, why?

1125
01:28:25,336 --> 01:28:28,077
We're getting out of the way so the city can come in and do some water work.

1126
01:28:28,097 --> 01:28:31,378
They'll come in after we do our work and they will be repaving the streets.

1127
01:28:34,032 --> 01:28:35,653
She said that the city is doing water work.

1128
01:28:35,673 --> 01:28:36,494
They're getting out of the way.

1129
01:28:36,514 --> 01:28:39,557
So the city water main works.

1130
01:28:41,358 --> 01:28:42,859
You're off right now.

1131
01:28:42,879 --> 01:28:45,041
Similar to the work necessary on Riverside Ave, sounds like.

1132
01:28:48,424 --> 01:28:51,186
Well, you guys don't necessarily want to do this, but they have to do water works.

1133
01:28:51,206 --> 01:28:55,350
Are you going to get out of the way?

1134
01:28:55,450 --> 01:28:57,832
Yes, it's on Metcalfe Street and Walnut Street.

1135
01:28:58,852 --> 01:29:14,180
It's approximately 730 feet on Walnut Street, from south to summer, and 690 feet on Metcalfe Street.

1136
01:29:14,360 --> 01:29:14,841
That's a lot.

1137
01:29:16,041 --> 01:29:24,266
So is the restoration going to be done curb to curb, or is it going to be one of these six inch trenches out to the middle of a street that in six months is going to fall apart and turn this into 600 feet of potholes?

1138
01:29:25,987 --> 01:29:27,728
So the city will come in after our work.

1139
01:29:28,869 --> 01:29:54,447
we're as part of the project we're going to walk this site with the city engineer to do whatever short term patch, they're requiring when we get when we apply for the permit, and then the city will come in after us, dig the street back up again, right where we moved our pipe over so that they can do some water to see my notes as again, some water, water supply.

1140
01:29:57,044 --> 01:30:02,129
work by the city method and then the city will go back and pay the street.

1141
01:30:02,149 --> 01:30:06,254
Does this have anything to do with the loan order that we just passed?

1142
01:30:06,434 --> 01:30:07,355
No, no, right.

1143
01:30:07,815 --> 01:30:09,637
We have it as a city engineer available.

1144
01:30:09,797 --> 01:30:12,880
Mr. Clark, do you have anyone from the city engineer's office or from DPW on the phone?

1145
01:30:22,585 --> 01:30:26,287
Motion of Councilor at the table seconded by seconded by Councilor Starbelli.

1146
01:30:26,647 --> 01:30:27,988
Motion to table is non-debatable.

1147
01:30:28,008 --> 01:30:28,048
Ms.

1148
01:30:28,068 --> 01:30:30,490
Cuddy, this is no reflection on the job you're doing.

1149
01:30:30,570 --> 01:30:35,092
It's more of a reflection on the information that the administration provides us when they put these papers on the agenda.

1150
01:30:35,712 --> 01:30:45,458
So, you know, here we are this evening and we're, you know, expected to vote for seven football fields worth of ground getting torn up and we have nobody here from the city engineers

1151
01:30:49,593 --> 01:30:50,673
restoration is going to look like.

1152
01:30:50,953 --> 01:31:00,176
And I'm not comfortable going into a neighborhood and tearing up, you know, 700, 800 feet worth of street, turning the neighborhood upside down and then not knowing what the final product is going to be.

1153
01:31:00,616 --> 01:31:05,797
So I apologize for having to sit through this meeting this evening, but I'm without further information from the administration.

1154
01:31:06,297 --> 01:31:08,378
I'm not very comfortable proceeding in any other fashion.

1155
01:31:09,618 --> 01:31:13,279
On Councilor Nye's motion to table, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, the motion is undebatable.

1156
01:31:13,879 --> 01:31:14,619
All those in favor?

1157
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:16,620
Opposed?

1158
01:31:18,030 --> 01:31:19,310
Motion passes to table.

1159
01:31:19,330 --> 01:31:23,512
Is there a motion on the floor?

1160
01:31:23,532 --> 01:31:28,374
Motion to revert to the regular order of business.

1161
01:31:28,414 --> 01:31:30,234
Councillor Scarpelli, seconded by Councillor Sang.

1162
01:31:30,255 --> 01:31:31,015
All those in favor?

1163
01:31:31,615 --> 01:31:31,995
Opposed?

1164
01:31:32,055 --> 01:31:32,895
Motion passes.

1165
01:31:32,915 --> 01:31:38,858
22-528 offered by Councillor Knight.

1166
01:31:39,278 --> 01:31:41,939
Being so resolved that the city administration met its criteria in the review

1167
01:31:42,738 --> 01:31:48,071
for the issuance of permit applications requiring traffic commission approval by also including considerations related to on-street parking impact.

1168
01:31:48,091 --> 01:31:48,613
Councillor Knight.

1169
01:31:50,297 --> 01:31:51,338
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1170
01:31:52,178 --> 01:32:04,827
Quite frequently I get calls, especially surrounding some of these car repair facilities automobile repair facilities along Mr. Avenue, relative to the amount of footprint that vehicles take up.

1171
01:32:05,707 --> 01:32:12,172
And also the parking of vehicles that they're servicing on public roads in public parking spots.

1172
01:32:13,313 --> 01:32:16,215
So, one thing I've noticed is every time we get a permit.

1173
01:32:17,255 --> 01:32:24,657
application before us that the traffic commission has to sign off saying that there'll be no traffic impact, but they failed to look at parking.

1174
01:32:25,158 --> 01:32:27,598
They failed to look at the parking impact of this proposed business.

1175
01:32:27,638 --> 01:32:30,599
So this proposed service might create.

1176
01:32:30,639 --> 01:32:41,083
So what I'm asking is that the administration revamp the criteria in establishing these reviews to also take into consideration the parking impacts so that we have a better idea.

1177
01:32:41,123 --> 01:32:44,964
We vote for something, what the parking impacts are as well as the traffic impacts.

1178
01:32:45,882 --> 01:32:46,503
much to ask for.

1179
01:32:46,543 --> 01:32:54,210
I think the administration could do a parking assessment or even maybe establish a certain criteria that would say the sex amount of parking spots per square feet.

1180
01:32:54,671 --> 01:32:55,151
And that's it.

1181
01:32:55,191 --> 01:32:57,734
Very similar to what we have in our zoning ordinance.

1182
01:32:58,535 --> 01:33:04,801
But with that being said, Mr President, what we're seeing, especially if you go down ST James Avenue and some of those streets off of Mystic Avenue,

1183
01:33:05,221 --> 01:33:08,224
is that every single parking spot is taken up by vehicles all day long.

1184
01:33:08,324 --> 01:33:11,768
Then six o'clock comes, the sidewalk rolls up and all those guys disappear.

1185
01:33:12,248 --> 01:33:16,052
Then six o'clock in the morning, all those cars are back there again, but they're not people working.

1186
01:33:16,092 --> 01:33:17,253
Those are cars that are being worked on.

1187
01:33:17,273 --> 01:33:20,656
They're being moved in and out of garages and being put in the street and being put back in the garage.

1188
01:33:21,217 --> 01:33:22,318
All right, well, it's a public way.

1189
01:33:22,418 --> 01:33:25,160
Those parking spots are also necessary for other businesses to utilize.

1190
01:33:25,441 --> 01:33:26,402
They should be turned over.

1191
01:33:26,422 --> 01:33:26,442
I

1192
01:33:35,524 --> 01:33:49,615
But ultimately, I think this is something that needs to be looked at, because it does certainly have an impact on, number one, public safety, and number two, our ability to turn over pockets and generate business for business owners and business storefronts in the downtown area.

1193
01:33:50,412 --> 01:33:55,136
Thank you, Mr. President, I thank counsel for bringing this on.

1194
01:33:55,176 --> 01:33:57,037
I've had many discussions with the chief about this.

1195
01:33:58,278 --> 01:34:01,101
And the chief has assured me that he was going to take the role on this.

1196
01:34:02,442 --> 01:34:05,885
Because of the amount of complaints that we're getting from all those businesses over there.

1197
01:34:07,166 --> 01:34:11,469
Not only in that little area, but you know, you get on Columbia, Columbia Street there.

1198
01:34:12,110 --> 01:34:12,570
People can't.

1199
01:34:13,351 --> 01:34:13,731
Those are all

1200
01:34:14,158 --> 01:34:17,520
backed up with cars from the place next to Grava.

1201
01:34:18,141 --> 01:34:21,043
I think they had a permit for 12 cars and they got about 50 in there.

1202
01:34:21,943 --> 01:34:25,525
And then in back of Grava is another body shop that just opened up.

1203
01:34:26,866 --> 01:34:31,269
And they say, these places just keep coming over and over.

1204
01:34:31,309 --> 01:34:31,369
And

1205
01:34:33,659 --> 01:34:36,860
What's happening is their employees are parking there.

1206
01:34:37,140 --> 01:34:40,780
Not only are they pulling the cars out of the garages, but the employees are parking there.

1207
01:34:41,180 --> 01:34:47,362
And now there's going to be a cannabis delivery service over there coming in soon, which I think got approved last week.

1208
01:34:48,362 --> 01:34:52,923
Though they've assured me that all their parking will be indoors, there'll be no cars on the street.

1209
01:34:53,423 --> 01:34:58,124
I hope that's what they told me is true, and I'll take them for their word on that.

1210
01:35:01,094 --> 01:35:05,797
And then you get all of the oil companies that go up and down that street.

1211
01:35:05,857 --> 01:35:09,159
Have you ever driven down the street with your car?

1212
01:35:09,179 --> 01:35:15,003
I'll tell you, there's going to be a day that comes and an oil truck is going to spring a leak.

1213
01:35:16,120 --> 01:35:20,584
from hitting one of those bumps on that on on that street that that's that's in such disrepair.

1214
01:35:20,604 --> 01:35:24,687
There's gonna be thousands of gallons of crude oil spilled on our streets.

1215
01:35:24,707 --> 01:35:27,990
So I say I spoke with the chief many times on this.

1216
01:35:28,370 --> 01:35:31,452
He's told me he's gonna take the lead, but I haven't seen any action from the chief on this.

1217
01:35:31,773 --> 01:35:32,153
And thanks.

1218
01:35:32,213 --> 01:35:36,416
Thank you for bringing this forward, because this is a problem for all the businesses in that neighborhood.

1219
01:35:36,436 --> 01:35:39,819
On the motion of Councilor Nights, seconded by Carabiello.

1220
01:35:39,879 --> 01:35:40,680
Any further discussion?

1221
01:35:42,505 --> 01:35:43,745
Seeing none, all those in favour?

1222
01:35:43,925 --> 01:35:44,165
Aye.

1223
01:35:44,445 --> 01:35:45,006
All opposed?

1224
01:35:45,086 --> 01:35:45,886
Motion passes.

1225
01:35:45,906 --> 01:35:47,986
22-529 offered by Councillor Knight.

1226
01:35:48,806 --> 01:36:05,430
Whereas the sewage infrastructure on Fulton Spring Road in front of pass numbers 129 to 132 is faulty, resulting in frequent sewage backups, be it so resolved that the Medford City Council request the Mayor direct the DPW to monitor this infrastructure and provide periodic cleaning of the sewage lines on a no less than bi-monthly basis to prevent further damage

1227
01:36:06,380 --> 01:36:10,223
taxpayer residents until such time that the underground infrastructure repairs can be made.

1228
01:36:10,283 --> 01:36:10,803
Councilor Knight.

1229
01:36:11,363 --> 01:36:12,664
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1230
01:36:12,684 --> 01:36:15,446
This is an ongoing situation up on Fulton Spring Road.

1231
01:36:16,046 --> 01:36:22,590
If you know where Mr. Falco lives, look down the street about four or five houses and you'll see that there's a situation down there where

1232
01:36:24,528 --> 01:36:28,212
The pitch of the underground infrastructure for sewage is not appropriate.

1233
01:36:28,993 --> 01:36:38,944
And this goes back now, several years, one of the homeowners there reached out to the DPW had representatives from the water department come up and take a look at what was going on.

1234
01:36:40,025 --> 01:36:44,910
The solution that the water department came up with at that time was, are you going to have to jack your house up eight inches.

1235
01:36:46,174 --> 01:36:55,184
So the gentleman went, invested $200,000, jacked up his house eight inches, and the day that they pulled the bulldozers away, he had another sewage backup.

1236
01:36:56,259 --> 01:36:59,701
The city engineer, DPW commissioner have been working on this.

1237
01:37:00,662 --> 01:37:01,282
They've looked at it.

1238
01:37:01,362 --> 01:37:14,451
What they've been able to determine is that in a quote, I believe things are all screwy under there would be the very technical term that was used, but the pipes, there's a water pipe that goes over sewer pipe that goes under a gas pipe.

1239
01:37:14,971 --> 01:37:20,415
There's a big problem, but this homeowner spent a ton of dough at the direction

1240
01:37:21,993 --> 01:37:28,475
about water and sewer department saying that if you jack your house up, you won't have to deal with this backflow issue.

1241
01:37:29,775 --> 01:37:33,016
They spent the money, they jacked the house up and they're still dealing with the issue.

1242
01:37:34,376 --> 01:37:39,397
The DPW commissioner is well aware of the situation and I've been assured that he's working on it.

1243
01:37:39,517 --> 01:37:44,498
I actually met with the residential homeowner this evening before I came to this meeting this evening.

1244
01:37:45,438 --> 01:37:51,700
I'd like to withdraw this matter at this point in time and give the DPW commissioner an opportunity to continue to do

1245
01:37:56,540 --> 01:38:00,443
come up to a significant and satisfactory remedy for our bodies involved.

1246
01:38:00,463 --> 01:38:01,923
So I will be withdrawing this at this time.

1247
01:38:02,464 --> 01:38:10,029
But I did want to just give a preface as to what this was all about, because I'm sure that would raise a lot of curiosity based upon the language of the resolution.

1248
01:38:11,069 --> 01:38:12,870
Motion is withdrawn.

1249
01:38:12,890 --> 01:38:14,311
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1250
01:38:14,331 --> 01:38:21,516
22-530 offered by Councilor Caravello being so resolved as the DPW Commissioner give a report on the status of the sidewalk repair and stump

1251
01:38:24,662 --> 01:38:25,623
Thank you, Mr President.

1252
01:38:26,283 --> 01:38:30,144
This council voted $1,000,000 for sidewalks, another half a million dollars for stumps.

1253
01:38:30,224 --> 01:38:37,966
The only people I've seen working on the sidewalks have been city employees and on the stumps.

1254
01:38:38,226 --> 01:38:41,907
So I want to know where we are with this.

1255
01:38:42,247 --> 01:38:43,668
Has the contract been bid out yet?

1256
01:38:45,288 --> 01:38:52,449
we're into October, and November's next in a few weeks, the cold's gonna come in.

1257
01:38:52,489 --> 01:38:59,491
Are we gonna be doing like we've done in the past, pouring concrete in the middle of December, so within six months it's coming up?

1258
01:39:01,471 --> 01:39:07,912
Again, I just don't see the amount of people out there doing work on sidewalks and stumps for the money that we put out there.

1259
01:39:07,952 --> 01:39:12,053
I wanna know, say, have these contracts even been bid out yet?

1260
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:16,921
So if we if we can get a report for the administration, be appreciated.

1261
01:39:17,882 --> 01:39:22,543
On the motion of Councilor Caravaglio seconded by second Councilor saying all those in favor.

1262
01:39:23,343 --> 01:39:23,824
Opposed.

1263
01:39:23,984 --> 01:39:32,787
Motion passes to do this 531 offered by Councilor Caravaglio be it so resolved that the Director of Energy and Sustainability update the Council and residents of the newly agreed

1264
01:39:33,695 --> 01:39:35,156
aggregate electricity contract.

1265
01:39:35,296 --> 01:39:37,297
Thank you, Mr. President.

1266
01:39:38,337 --> 01:39:47,282
I think we have the Alicia Hunter on the line tonight to explain to let the residents know about this, about the aggregate contract that we've just

1267
01:39:48,606 --> 01:39:49,786
sign that are renewed again.

1268
01:39:50,707 --> 01:39:59,328
I don't know if you're following the news, they're talking that by December, electric bills are going to be skyrocketing, almost doubling of what they are from right now.

1269
01:39:59,768 --> 01:40:13,471
So if Alicia can give us a little update on what kind of rate we've got, and I know it's been out there, but for the people who haven't seen it in the paper or whatever, if she can just give us a little brief synopsis of what's going on there.

1270
01:40:14,691 --> 01:40:16,932
Yes, Mr. Clerk, if you could recognize Director Hunt.

1271
01:40:18,489 --> 01:40:20,050
Yes, good evening, councillors.

1272
01:40:20,150 --> 01:40:21,091
Thank you very much.

1273
01:40:21,171 --> 01:40:23,212
Thank you very much to Councillor Carviello.

1274
01:40:23,232 --> 01:40:27,715
As I'm starting, would you mind allowing me to share screen for a minute?

1275
01:40:27,755 --> 01:40:30,817
I have a few images that to help the residents with this.

1276
01:40:32,238 --> 01:40:40,383
So as people are very aware in Massachusetts right now, the utility rates, the electric rates are going up very high in Massachusetts.

1277
01:40:41,323 --> 01:40:53,835
Several years ago, Medford passed community choice aggregation, which allows the city to negotiate for basically to go out to bid for an electricity rate on behalf of the residents.

1278
01:40:54,375 --> 01:40:57,699
A lot of residents are in this program, but a lot of residents are not.

1279
01:40:58,259 --> 01:41:06,985
And part of why I wanted to be here this evening is that we are, in fact, getting a lot of questions from residents about this in my office.

1280
01:41:07,265 --> 01:41:14,770
And we're getting when we talk to people at Oktoberfest, they were very excited to hear that we had something we could do to help with this.

1281
01:41:15,831 --> 01:41:22,355
And in fact, we are getting the senior centers also getting a lot of questions about this.

1282
01:41:22,435 --> 01:41:25,617
Can you see the screen, the slide that I have up now?

1283
01:41:28,717 --> 01:41:30,359
It looks like you can see that.

1284
01:41:31,180 --> 01:41:35,143
So I wanted to share with the community.

1285
01:41:35,624 --> 01:41:37,766
So this is Medford's program.

1286
01:41:37,786 --> 01:41:39,948
There are a lot of numbers on here.

1287
01:41:39,968 --> 01:41:42,910
Our rate is going up from where it has been.

1288
01:41:43,251 --> 01:41:45,673
We've had one rate fixed in for three years.

1289
01:41:46,213 --> 01:41:51,098
A lot of people were very astute and noticed that our rates were expiring in December, which was correct.

1290
01:41:51,656 --> 01:41:53,858
We have a new contract that is for two years.

1291
01:41:54,479 --> 01:42:02,726
The electricity market is so out of control that we couldn't get a good contract for three years, which is why our new contract is for two years.

1292
01:42:03,967 --> 01:42:09,272
Everybody goes by default into this Medford local green, which will be 15.3 cents per kilowatt hour.

1293
01:42:12,431 --> 01:42:28,381
If you look over on the far column, the national grid rate, that if you are on National Grid basic service, you're going to go up to 33.8 cents a kilowatt hour, which is why we're saying this winter, you don't want to be in National Grid's basic service.

1294
01:42:29,061 --> 01:42:35,445
I will take a moment to just say there's an option through this to opt up to 100% local renewable energy.

1295
01:42:35,586 --> 01:42:36,446
It's a little bit more.

1296
01:42:36,626 --> 01:42:37,727
It's 18.9 cents a kilowatt hour.

1297
01:42:40,540 --> 01:42:44,182
But again, that's a choice that you can opt up to that.

1298
01:42:44,862 --> 01:42:49,745
A lot of people are calling and asking, how do they know if they're already in the program?

1299
01:42:51,065 --> 01:42:58,629
If you look at your electricity bill, on the third page of the bill is a section here that's called supply services.

1300
01:42:59,390 --> 01:43:03,432
And if you are in Medford's aggregation, it will look like this.

1301
01:43:03,552 --> 01:43:07,874
It'll say Dynegy Medford aggregation, and it'll look like this.

1302
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:11,221
And then you are in it, you don't need to do anything.

1303
01:43:12,822 --> 01:43:17,084
You'll see that your rate right now is 11.5 cents, it'll go up.

1304
01:43:17,204 --> 01:43:20,246
This is actually the current 100% green rate.

1305
01:43:21,107 --> 01:43:24,248
Sorry, I used 100% green bill as an example.

1306
01:43:25,389 --> 01:43:32,933
If you look at your third page of your bill and it looks like this, supply services, national grid, basic service fixed.

1307
01:43:33,635 --> 01:43:40,363
then you are in National Grid's default service, and you're going to go up to the 33 cents.

1308
01:43:41,224 --> 01:43:44,268
And frankly, we recommend that you switch to something.

1309
01:43:44,968 --> 01:43:51,316
And I'm only allowed to recommend things that we've gone out to bid for, so I can't recommend anybody else.

1310
01:43:52,409 --> 01:43:57,451
If you come to this page, and it looks like this, but it doesn't say Dynegy, it says something else.

1311
01:43:57,471 --> 01:44:01,373
It could say Constellation, or Direct Energy, or Clean Choice, or something.

1312
01:44:01,853 --> 01:44:10,557
Then you should look at what your rate is, and you should see what your rate looks like, how does that compare to what the city's rate is going to be, and make a decision.

1313
01:44:11,599 --> 01:44:14,783
If you have one of those other companies, you'll have a phone number here.

1314
01:44:15,444 --> 01:44:18,589
We are talking to people who have good rates here, something in the 11, 12, 13 cents.

1315
01:44:18,609 --> 01:44:18,850
That's great.

1316
01:44:18,870 --> 01:44:20,552
We've also seen 25, 30 cents, 35 cents here.

1317
01:44:26,147 --> 01:44:27,388
with those other companies.

1318
01:44:28,268 --> 01:44:31,990
So if you don't wanna have to think about it, we'll manage it for you.

1319
01:44:33,051 --> 01:44:36,813
It's your choice at this point to opt in or not.

1320
01:44:38,394 --> 01:44:40,395
This is some information about how to enroll.

1321
01:44:41,136 --> 01:44:44,738
There's a webpage medfordcea.com.

1322
01:44:45,418 --> 01:44:50,041
And if you go to slash enroll, there's a phone number that you can call to enroll.

1323
01:44:51,542 --> 01:44:53,464
866-220-5696.

1324
01:44:56,347 --> 01:44:58,269
Our consultants are Good Energy.

1325
01:44:58,769 --> 01:45:07,158
They will be at the Medford Council on Aging again this week on Thursday, and you can call the Council of Aging and make an appointment.

1326
01:45:07,739 --> 01:45:12,303
If they get too many people that it's too crowded, then we'll have them come back another week.

1327
01:45:13,564 --> 01:45:20,809
This consultant will also be at the Harvester Energy Festival this weekend on Saturday from 12 to 3.

1328
01:45:21,489 --> 01:45:27,733
If you bring your electric bill with you, he can help you look at it and help advise you on what program you're in.

1329
01:45:27,753 --> 01:45:38,360
I just was asked by my staff that answers the phone to hit a couple of answers to questions that they're getting a lot.

1330
01:45:39,898 --> 01:45:46,243
All residential households were automatically enrolled in the program several years ago with mailings before that announcement.

1331
01:45:47,364 --> 01:45:53,028
And people could opt out, some people chose to, some people never realized that they were in the program.

1332
01:45:54,209 --> 01:46:01,714
The main goal of this program is to provide price stability, so you're not impacted by these major fluctuations.

1333
01:46:03,533 --> 01:46:06,536
You will continue to get your electricity from National Grid.

1334
01:46:07,577 --> 01:46:08,718
You will get one bill.

1335
01:46:08,878 --> 01:46:10,460
It'll be from National Grid.

1336
01:46:10,881 --> 01:46:14,284
And like I said, it'll just have this section on it.

1337
01:46:14,344 --> 01:46:16,166
This is on your regular utility bill.

1338
01:46:16,787 --> 01:46:23,474
National Grid is still responsible for any power outages, any repairs, any issues with your electricity.

1339
01:46:24,597 --> 01:46:29,961
Um, you can opt out or opt into our program at any time with no fee.

1340
01:46:30,481 --> 01:46:33,183
The city has the contract, not the individuals.

1341
01:46:33,403 --> 01:46:35,525
So you got, you can come and go as you please.

1342
01:46:37,106 --> 01:46:40,929
Um, sorry, there are just so many things that people have been calling and asking our office about.

1343
01:46:40,949 --> 01:46:45,132
The other one is that yes, it includes some local renewable energy.

1344
01:46:45,773 --> 01:46:48,755
We buy that through Green Energy Consumer Alliance.

1345
01:46:49,476 --> 01:47:00,505
And if you opt up to the 100%, a portion of that becomes tax deductible, the difference between what you would have paid and what you pay for the extra green.

1346
01:47:01,165 --> 01:47:09,552
And Green Energy Consumer Alliance will send you a letter in January that you can use on your taxes for the tax deductible part of that.

1347
01:47:10,692 --> 01:47:15,053
there is the option to opt down to the Medford Basic amount.

1348
01:47:15,693 --> 01:47:27,375
And I'll just show you that it is 0.2, it's two tenths of a penny less to go with the Medford Basic that has no extra renewable energy in it.

1349
01:47:28,535 --> 01:47:31,616
And I think those are, thank you.

1350
01:47:32,196 --> 01:47:33,316
Are there any questions?

1351
01:47:33,456 --> 01:47:34,976
Should I answer anything for the council?

1352
01:47:34,996 --> 01:47:38,877
Any questions by members of the council?

1353
01:47:42,066 --> 01:47:42,827
I'm not a question.

1354
01:47:42,847 --> 01:47:51,995
I just wanted to thank your office for working on this and tell everyone that to definitely take some time out of your evening to walk through and check your bill.

1355
01:47:53,016 --> 01:47:57,841
I called my parents, and they were not on the aggregation.

1356
01:47:58,561 --> 01:48:17,725
and just by that simple check, my parents are gonna save so much money in the next two years, and especially in a difficult economic time with higher prices, this is something that families can do to save some money and help our city as well.

1357
01:48:18,205 --> 01:48:20,086
So thank you very much for this.

1358
01:48:20,106 --> 01:48:21,126
Thank you, Councilor Sang.

1359
01:48:24,306 --> 01:48:26,967
Any members of the public for public participation?

1360
01:48:28,553 --> 01:48:30,034
come to the podium or go on Zoom.

1361
01:48:30,074 --> 01:48:31,335
I see we have one on Zoom.

1362
01:48:31,656 --> 01:48:33,617
Please give your name and address for the record, please.

1363
01:48:36,360 --> 01:48:39,002
Yes, I just I want to speak to thank Director Hunt.

1364
01:48:39,322 --> 01:48:39,622
Oh, sorry.

1365
01:48:39,642 --> 01:48:41,904
My name is Matthew Papes Lieberman on 15 Canal Street.

1366
01:48:42,405 --> 01:48:44,847
So yeah, I wanted to thank Director Hunt because

1367
01:48:45,598 --> 01:48:53,463
I have, as far as this energy aggregation program we have, and there are many, many cities in the Commonwealth that don't have that.

1368
01:48:53,903 --> 01:49:00,347
I used to attend these hearings, the joint hearings at the state house.

1369
01:49:01,087 --> 01:49:09,772
And there are a lot of cities that have been on the waiting list and they're not getting the approval that Alicia's department or Director Hunt's department was able to get for us.

1370
01:49:10,913 --> 01:49:14,175
I know that when I've had questions and I've been in that department, I've asked,

1371
01:49:14,955 --> 01:49:15,836
I've always been helped.

1372
01:49:16,096 --> 01:49:21,578
I've been in this city for over a decade, worked with a lot of different department heads.

1373
01:49:21,778 --> 01:49:23,699
There've been quite a few different administrations.

1374
01:49:24,279 --> 01:49:29,441
I've had many good experiences at City Hall, bad experiences at City Hall with some department heads.

1375
01:49:29,942 --> 01:49:35,704
I think that there's a big narrative that we hear a lot about how everything's dysfunctional there and about how nobody's responsive.

1376
01:49:35,724 --> 01:49:43,688
But in my experience, departments like Director Hunt's are ones that we could consider ourselves, I think, very, very fortunate to have.

1377
01:49:44,308 --> 01:49:47,609
I really thank Director Hunt for that administration.

1378
01:49:51,091 --> 01:49:54,192
Thank you, Matt.

1379
01:49:54,452 --> 01:49:55,832
Any further public comments?

1380
01:49:57,133 --> 01:50:02,775
And thank you, Zach, Councillor Behrs, and thank you, Matt, for the kind words.

1381
01:50:03,816 --> 01:50:07,597
I do wanna just take one minute to just mention one other thing.

1382
01:50:08,317 --> 01:50:12,059
No one from the city will go door to door selling

1383
01:50:12,839 --> 01:50:19,105
electricity asking you to change your electric thing, your electric service or solar.

1384
01:50:19,566 --> 01:50:25,511
We have heard that there is at least one solar company representing that they're partnering with the city.

1385
01:50:26,052 --> 01:50:30,536
We do not have any partners with any solar companies at this time.

1386
01:50:31,437 --> 01:50:53,387
um and there are no nobody is authorized to go door to door on behalf of the city at this time there are also a lot of mailings that show up in the mail there have been stuff on the web that is very deceptive that implies that there are special programs um in fact at my house today i got a flyer that said grant program limited

1387
01:50:53,867 --> 01:50:59,570
The state has mandated a certain number of homes produce their own power and your neighborhood has been chosen for conversion.

1388
01:51:00,111 --> 01:51:02,452
I can tell you definitively, this is a scam.

1389
01:51:03,733 --> 01:51:04,713
Sorry, it's hard to see.

1390
01:51:04,733 --> 01:51:06,974
I was gonna put it up.

1391
01:51:07,475 --> 01:51:09,996
But there are a lot of mailings that are going around.

1392
01:51:10,016 --> 01:51:12,918
A mailing from the city will have the city seal on it.

1393
01:51:13,418 --> 01:51:21,823
And honestly, at this point, it'll probably do something like reference my name and my department in order to help residents recognize

1394
01:51:22,223 --> 01:51:29,947
that this is a legitimate nailing because of the number of things that are going out that are deceptive.

1395
01:51:30,027 --> 01:51:32,308
And I just want people to be forewarned about that.

1396
01:51:33,589 --> 01:51:34,049
Thank you.

1397
01:51:34,069 --> 01:51:36,231
Director Hud, any further comments?

1398
01:51:38,512 --> 01:51:45,856
On the motion of Councilor Kerrio, seconded by Councilor Sang, to receive in place on file.

1399
01:51:46,356 --> 01:51:47,577
To receive in place on file.

1400
01:51:47,877 --> 01:51:48,157
Second.

1401
01:51:48,397 --> 01:51:49,117
All those in favor.

1402
01:51:50,058 --> 01:51:51,379
Opposed, motion passes.

1403
01:51:52,515 --> 01:51:56,077
Next one was myself and President Morrell, and then another one by myself.

1404
01:51:56,117 --> 01:52:01,099
Do folks mind if I read it from here, or do you wanna?

1405
01:52:01,119 --> 01:52:19,908
22-533, offered by Vice President Beres and President Morrell, be it so resolved by the Benford City Council that we meet in committee of the whole to discuss the scope of a contract for legal services to support ongoing work to update the city's zoning ordinance and a live set ordinance with the city's multiple active plans, including but not limited to the housing production plan, climate action and adaptation plan, open space plan,

1406
01:52:20,803 --> 01:52:23,484
basically infrastructure master plan and draft comprehensive plan.

1407
01:52:23,504 --> 01:52:41,609
The purpose of this resolution, we received funding at the last minute in the budget to continue our work with zoning consultants and we should meet to discuss the scope of that work and then potentially figure out what we need to do to bring in someone to assist us with the continued zoning work.

1408
01:52:42,469 --> 01:52:45,330
Any comments, Councilor Sang and then Councilor Collins.

1409
01:52:46,115 --> 01:52:49,578
I wanted to thank you and President Morrell for putting this on the agenda.

1410
01:52:50,399 --> 01:52:59,107
This is some of the most exciting work that we are working on as a council and we'll have the chance, the opportunity to work on the council for the next few years.

1411
01:53:00,448 --> 01:53:04,712
That legal money, we fought very, very hard for it on this council.

1412
01:53:05,192 --> 01:53:05,512
We really

1413
01:53:06,293 --> 01:53:11,735
stayed together and really aligned our priorities so we can get started on projects like this.

1414
01:53:12,215 --> 01:53:24,280
And this is that very important step that we have to take on this council to meet our objectives as a community when it comes to all these different plans, when it comes to housing, when it comes to the environment, when it comes to zoning.

1415
01:53:24,840 --> 01:53:37,984
And we've already seen all the fruits of our labor and the labor of Council's past when it comes to zoning and that major zoning recodification that we passed earlier this year.

1416
01:53:39,425 --> 01:53:47,368
We see that new growth is slowly but surely coming to the Council because of that work that this Council and Council's past have done.

1417
01:53:47,888 --> 01:53:51,389
And I feel optimistic about the work that we can do going forward.

1418
01:53:55,874 --> 01:53:56,394
Thank you.

1419
01:53:57,735 --> 01:54:03,338
I was going to make many of the same points when we talked about this project several months ago.

1420
01:54:03,358 --> 01:54:10,081
I like to say we're a community that's very rich in plans, and this is so exciting because this is the chance to actually take

1421
01:54:11,390 --> 01:54:25,663
the vision and those plans, which a lot of our, you know, truly expert dedicated city staff have worked on, you know, preparing the menu of options with which we can guide our future and create the policies that will bind us towards actually manifesting that future in our community.

1422
01:54:25,723 --> 01:54:28,025
So I appreciate you for bringing it forward.

1423
01:54:28,045 --> 01:54:31,689
Looking forward to this meeting and a motion for approval after the comments of my fellow

1424
01:54:33,978 --> 01:54:35,959
Thank you, Mr President.

1425
01:54:36,559 --> 01:54:42,982
I think I think this is something that we should prioritize to get this a little more fast track than we already have.

1426
01:54:43,202 --> 01:54:44,603
We've been sitting around with this.

1427
01:54:45,363 --> 01:54:46,644
We've already done the phase one.

1428
01:54:48,764 --> 01:54:50,245
We're almost quite almost into a year.

1429
01:54:51,226 --> 01:54:53,747
That being done, and you've seen what we've done with it.

1430
01:54:55,027 --> 01:54:58,529
I would like I would hope that we're able to bring back attorney

1431
01:54:59,915 --> 01:55:08,240
because I'd hate to go with another attorney with a different mindset and maybe have to change directions.

1432
01:55:08,280 --> 01:55:17,506
He was very good and by all accounts, he's probably the Dean of Zoning in the state of Massachusetts.

1433
01:55:17,946 --> 01:55:28,233
So if we could prioritize it and bring him back so we can keep on with the same thought process that we've gone through right now.

1434
01:55:29,871 --> 01:55:30,891
Thank you, Councilor Kerrio.

1435
01:55:32,112 --> 01:55:33,052
Any further discussion?

1436
01:55:33,072 --> 01:55:34,172
Move approval.

1437
01:55:34,192 --> 01:55:39,954
The goal is to have this meeting on October 26th, so that would be in a couple of weeks.

1438
01:55:40,115 --> 01:55:41,935
That's Godford Chevalier Day.

1439
01:55:41,955 --> 01:55:43,996
It's Chevalier Day.

1440
01:55:46,037 --> 01:55:47,097
Can't meet on Chevalier Day.

1441
01:55:47,699 --> 01:55:49,941
I mean, that's not a paid holiday.

1442
01:55:50,201 --> 01:55:51,702
That is losing her touch.

1443
01:55:55,565 --> 01:56:02,151
On the motion of council night to approve seconded by second councillor Carvio.

1444

Motion to suspend the rules.

1486
01:59:16,158 --> 01:59:18,999
Oh no, but so I don't know if I'm opposed or in favor of it.

1487
01:59:19,019 --> 01:59:19,900
You're not sure if you are.

1488
01:59:19,980 --> 01:59:20,400
Yeah, so.

1489
01:59:21,080 --> 01:59:21,300
Okay.

1490
01:59:21,380 --> 01:59:22,281
I'll let you know after.

1491
01:59:22,581 --> 01:59:22,921
Okay.

1492
01:59:23,862 --> 01:59:24,122
All right.

01:59:24,202 --> 01:59:25,843
Seeing none, this portion of the hearing is closed.

1494
01:59:26,503 --> 01:59:30,365
We'll go to the petitioner for now to mispronounce for a presentation.

1495
01:59:35,709 --> 01:59:36,510
We have to unmute again.

1496
01:59:43,276 --> 01:59:43,696
All right.

1497
01:59:46,578 --> 01:59:47,079
We can hear you.

1498
01:59:47,099 --> 01:59:48,320
Okay, thank you.

1499
01:59:49,918 --> 02:00:07,953
So, um, so the, we are here to request a special permit and a class two business certificate to allow automobile rental operations out of 616 Felsway 616 Felsway currently serves as list hub, which provides driver services

1500
02:00:08,733 --> 02:00:20,717
for Lyft drivers, such as driver onboarding, technical support, there to provide really any, to have in-person interactions with drivers if they have any questions.

1501
02:00:21,417 --> 02:00:36,882
With the special permit, we are looking to add the FlexDrive program, which is a vehicle rental program for Lyft drivers, and which would then be operating at this space, along with some auxiliary parking at 80 Station Landing.

1502
02:00:38,518 --> 02:00:51,101
So I'm here to answer any questions that have to do with the operation, but it is an existing facility, and it's just adding the additional operation for vehicle rentals out of this space.

1503
02:00:55,142 --> 02:00:56,182
Thank you for the presentation.

1504
02:00:56,222 --> 02:00:57,182
We're gonna go to the council.

1505
02:00:57,202 --> 02:00:59,683
We'll go to Councilor Scarpelli, then Councilor Knight.

1506
02:01:00,703 --> 02:01:07,465
Sure, obviously this is why it's a special permit request, but I,

1507
02:01:09,469 --> 02:01:17,352
being that you're from San Francisco, you haven't seen or understand where 616 Felsway is, correct?

1508
02:01:18,632 --> 02:01:19,572
I have been to the space.

1509
02:01:20,833 --> 02:01:25,414
Okay, so it is an absolute nightmare of a location.

1510
02:01:25,934 --> 02:01:36,538
And to add more traffic, this is why I get a little disappointed in the traffic impact reports, there's no traffic impact anticipated.

1511
02:01:37,597 --> 02:01:40,558
Now we're looking to add 50 vehicles to this process?

1512
02:01:40,578 --> 02:01:49,120
50 vehicles would be to the auxiliary parking, but the FlexDrive program already operates in the market.

1513
02:01:49,180 --> 02:01:52,081
This would be a relocation to this space.

1514
02:01:53,762 --> 02:01:57,623
Right, so this is why I'm a little confused on why put 616.

1515
02:01:57,923 --> 02:02:04,465
If that's the case, you said that the drivers have an opportunity to go to the 616 location for

1516
02:02:05,941 --> 02:02:07,482
That is correct.

1517
02:02:08,302 --> 02:02:12,484
Yeah, so currently drivers go to 616 to get any driver support to get on boarded.

1518
02:02:13,204 --> 02:02:19,687
But what we're adding is drivers can now make an appointment to come to the location to pick up a vehicle for rentals.

1519
02:02:20,507 --> 02:02:27,871
And something to note about our rental program is that the most drivers hold on to the vehicles for a long period of time.

1520
02:02:28,971 --> 02:02:35,234
It's not like a traditional rental operations where you have somebody coming in for a weekend trip or a day trip,

1521
02:02:35,738 --> 02:02:38,943
It's something that drivers hold on to the vehicles for quite some time.

1522
02:02:39,383 --> 02:02:49,297
So it's not your traditional rental like in and out type of traffic due to the fact that drivers really do come in an appointment only and hold on to these vehicles for a long period of time.

1523
02:02:51,368 --> 02:02:57,792
So, and then the other location, it's a hub where they're going to be parked in the parking lot or in the garage?

1524
02:02:58,353 --> 02:03:01,835
Yeah, so the parking garage, it will just be auxiliary parking.

1525
02:03:01,855 --> 02:03:04,196
Drivers will not be going into that space.

1526
02:03:04,577 --> 02:03:12,542
That will only be employees that would be using that for overnight parking or vehicles that are being parked at the time.

1527
02:03:13,322 --> 02:03:18,546
So all those automobiles that'll be parked in Medford are registered through Medford in Medford?

1528
02:03:22,177 --> 02:03:23,917
I don't know if I know how to answer that question.

1529
02:03:25,558 --> 02:03:37,360
Well, I mean, if we're parking 50 automobiles in our city, Medford accepts excise tax for automobiles that are parked and based in our community.

1530
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:42,981
Are those 50 cars based in going to pay excise tax in our community?

1531
02:03:43,642 --> 02:03:49,683
I believe so because the operations are out of that space or out of the 616 Bellsway space.

1532
02:03:51,292 --> 02:03:53,423
Do you have any more assurances than I believe so?

1533
02:03:54,027 --> 02:03:55,608
No, I would have to get that confirmation.

1534
02:03:55,868 --> 02:03:56,689
I apologize.

1535
02:03:56,729 --> 02:04:17,705
So for many different reasons, one being that we don't have a city solicitor that if I had questions that I can call to ask the legal questions dealing with this and the fact that this is something first time I've heard of this, you're looking at two locations and 50 more automobiles that will be parked in.

1536
02:04:18,365 --> 02:04:21,788
Is there a negotiation between you and the lift and the

1537
02:04:23,549 --> 02:04:26,051
garage companies.

1538
02:04:26,151 --> 02:04:29,154
Is there is there an agreement between them?

1539
02:04:30,154 --> 02:04:36,760
Yes, between Flex Drive and the parking lot, we would be facing the 50 parking spaces.

1540
02:04:38,609 --> 02:04:44,951
but we have an entity that's used for public parking now being used as a business entity.

1541
02:04:45,472 --> 02:04:52,554
That's now going to be over, it's gonna be, because I'm a little confused.

1542
02:04:52,594 --> 02:04:54,015
It's gonna be, they're gonna be there.

1543
02:04:54,435 --> 02:04:55,475
So there'll be housed there.

1544
02:04:55,515 --> 02:05:01,117
So you'll have drivers coming in and out, taking those vehicles out of that location.

1545
02:05:01,137 --> 02:05:02,018
And,

1546
02:05:03,685 --> 02:05:16,754
then we don't know if they're going to be registered in Medford where there'd be tax in Medford and truly don't understand the impact or I know the traffic engineer isn't online, correct?

1547
02:05:16,774 --> 02:05:22,698
And sorry, I did just get clarification that we will be registering the vehicle taxes in city of Medford.

1548
02:05:23,258 --> 02:05:24,979
We did get- Off of vehicles?

1549
02:05:25,319 --> 02:05:25,880
That's correct.

1550
02:05:26,160 --> 02:05:27,841
Anything that would be operating in this market.

1551
02:05:28,889 --> 02:05:37,733
And then, you know, the traffic impact, I know that is one of the most densely populated areas that I know I traverse there every day.

1552
02:05:38,354 --> 02:05:43,656
And to see that adding another 50 more vehicles at a time is something that I have questions with.

1553
02:05:43,676 --> 02:05:51,960
So my personal opinion right now, until we get legal, I have, I get some legal questions that I need to ask, you know,

1554
02:05:53,456 --> 02:05:56,958
an entity in the city that I can ask, which I don't, we don't have a solicitor.

1555
02:05:56,978 --> 02:05:58,199
We don't have a city solicitor.

1556
02:05:58,239 --> 02:06:03,442
So I guess I'll have to call the mayor's office to see who can answer some of these questions legally.

1557
02:06:04,823 --> 02:06:09,967
I would recommend that we table this until we get further understanding of what this process is.

1558
02:06:10,047 --> 02:06:12,528
So that would be my recommendation, Mr. President.

1559
02:06:14,429 --> 02:06:16,070
That would be a motion to table.

1560
02:06:18,892 --> 02:06:21,354
Well, I'll delay that then if we have questions.

1561
02:06:21,394 --> 02:06:21,834
So thank you.

1562
02:06:24,242 --> 02:06:25,363
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1563
02:06:25,523 --> 02:06:30,067
I'm somewhat familiar with flex car and flex hub.

1564
02:06:30,107 --> 02:06:45,880
One of the questions I have is this rental car is this going to be a rental car that's used for when they say drivers, you know, I keep thinking picturing driver like a Lyft driver in the Lyft driver works for Lyft and then they rent the vehicle through Lyft to use to provide the Lyft service to consumers.

1565
02:06:46,501 --> 02:06:48,943
Or is this where these are just going to be rental cars that

1566
02:06:49,464 --> 02:06:54,290
The driver is me, and I want to rent the car and I can just go through flex lift to get the car.

1567
02:06:54,971 --> 02:06:57,935
Can she explain clarify that for me please.

1568
02:06:57,995 --> 02:06:58,796
Yeah, absolutely.

1569
02:06:58,977 --> 02:06:59,758
Yeah, thank you.

1570
02:06:59,778 --> 02:07:06,187
Thank you for the question so flex drive is a service for lift drivers so the lift drivers have to be on the platform.

1571
02:07:06,707 --> 02:07:09,728
in order to get this service from us.

1572
02:07:10,369 --> 02:07:14,350
So it is, and that's why I was stating it is by appointment only.

1573
02:07:14,910 --> 02:07:22,773
So it's not your regular traffic that you would get from a normal rental like Hertz, where you're going in and out and you've got a bunch of different people.

1574
02:07:22,793 --> 02:07:25,594
I mean, these are by appointment only and we have them scheduled.

1575
02:07:25,694 --> 02:07:26,795
So traffic wise,

1576
02:07:27,835 --> 02:07:35,897
we wouldn't see an increase in traffic because our appointments, whether you're coming in for a technical support on the app, let's say, right?

1577
02:07:35,977 --> 02:07:37,997
Like somebody comes in, that's an appointment.

1578
02:07:38,097 --> 02:07:42,498
And then 30 minutes later, we might have another appointment, which is for the FlexDrive program.

1579
02:07:43,058 --> 02:07:46,679
So it's not increasing the amount of traffic that's coming into the space.

1580
02:07:47,079 --> 02:07:50,160
It's just adding an additional service to that program.

1581
02:07:52,722 --> 02:08:02,361
So ultimately it's somewhat like we have a post office over here and the post office has trucks and the employees of the post office use the trucks.

1582
02:08:04,049 --> 02:08:10,515
And this is the same thing, the employees of Lyft would use the Lyft, the FlexLyft vehicles to perform the functions.

1583
02:08:10,555 --> 02:08:13,638
Now, that's assuming that they don't have cars, right?

1584
02:08:14,198 --> 02:08:19,563
Are they going to be authorized to park vehicles there all day while they take these FlexCars out?

1585
02:08:19,723 --> 02:08:22,706
Or are you saying that they're more long term than short term?

1586
02:08:23,166 --> 02:08:28,811
So I just, I think part of the concern that we're hearing from my colleague is that it's heavily congested.

1587
02:08:30,103 --> 02:08:31,123
heavily congested area.

1588
02:08:32,144 --> 02:08:39,745
And because of that, there are some public safety concerns that coupled with the fact that there's some issues with the garage.

1589
02:08:40,326 --> 02:08:42,006
The excise tax, I think, was a great question.

1590
02:08:42,026 --> 02:08:42,826
That makes a lot of sense.

1591
02:08:43,126 --> 02:08:44,067
The business is going to be here.

1592
02:08:44,087 --> 02:08:51,028
The vehicle should be garaged here so the city can offset the damages to our infrastructure with the funds that we generate.

1593
02:08:51,688 --> 02:08:56,230
But I certainly support the gentleman's motion to table the matter.

1594
02:08:56,410 --> 02:08:57,810
In fact, we need to go back to the table

1595
02:09:00,535 --> 02:09:05,057
a little bit closer to an understanding of what this program is.

1596
02:09:05,137 --> 02:09:06,118
I personally have no problem with it.

1597
02:09:07,938 --> 02:09:08,659
I think it makes sense.

1598
02:09:08,739 --> 02:09:13,741
I would make some recommendations that, you know, the special permit go with the business and not with the address.

1599
02:09:15,221 --> 02:09:16,162
Do a 90 day review.

1600
02:09:16,962 --> 02:09:18,663
But as of right now, it doesn't feel as though

1601
02:09:30,685 --> 02:09:35,547
I think Lift Hub has been a pretty good neighbor in this community.

1602
02:09:36,607 --> 02:09:39,589
They've been pretty open with us when they came to this community.

1603
02:09:40,109 --> 02:09:41,509
They let us know they were coming.

1604
02:09:41,529 --> 02:09:42,610
They invited us to come down.

1605
02:09:42,830 --> 02:09:47,512
They've always been visible and available to speak with anybody from government that has any concerns.

1606
02:09:47,992 --> 02:09:56,575
So I certainly don't have an issue with their business model or the way they run their business, but the quality of life stuff and the neighborhood stuff do

1607
02:10:01,748 --> 02:10:05,670
some of the entities that the larger businesses that are residential property.

1608
02:10:05,710 --> 02:10:09,812
So that stuff needs to be put into consideration.

1609
02:10:11,032 --> 02:10:14,994
So I would second gentleman's motion to table it.

1610
02:10:16,095 --> 02:10:22,278
Should he reintroduce it in an effort for us to come to some common ground and see if we can figure this one out.

1611
02:10:22,498 --> 02:10:24,899
Because I think Lyft is a good employer to have here.

1612
02:10:25,079 --> 02:10:26,780
Thank you, councilor.

1613
02:10:26,800 --> 02:10:27,480
Councilor Kerrio.

1614
02:10:27,500 --> 02:10:28,301
Thank you, Mr. President.

1615
02:10:29,511 --> 02:10:33,072
I don't think most people even know that that Lyft office even exists there.

1616
02:10:33,352 --> 02:10:36,973
I think they've been there for probably close to five years now, if I'm not mistaken.

1617
02:10:37,653 --> 02:10:39,794
I remember going up there when it first opened.

1618
02:10:42,995 --> 02:10:48,937
So I'll disagree with my fellow councilors about the traffic impact over there.

1619
02:10:50,317 --> 02:10:54,198
The amount of people they have there going there during the day is minimal.

1620
02:10:55,258 --> 02:10:57,339
Most of their traffic have people going in there

1621
02:10:57,692 --> 02:10:59,772
to going in there during those off hours of the day.

1622
02:11:00,813 --> 02:11:06,574
So my only concern is, I'm happy to hear that all those cars are gonna be registered.

1623
02:11:07,834 --> 02:11:10,455
So we get the excise tax.

1624
02:11:11,535 --> 02:11:18,416
My only concern is where those 80 cars are gonna be parked when you drop your car off to pick up the lift car.

1625
02:11:19,617 --> 02:11:21,297
So that's a question I have.

1626
02:11:21,337 --> 02:11:24,318
Are those people gonna be allowed to park in that garage?

1627
02:11:25,138 --> 02:11:26,038
Ma'am, would you know that?

1628
02:11:26,734 --> 02:11:35,442
So they will not be most drivers come with it don't have a vehicle so they normally get dropped off or will be getting a lift ride to the facility.

1629
02:11:35,823 --> 02:11:41,588
So there will be no parking driver parking or customer parking on site overnight parking.

1630
02:11:43,250 --> 02:11:45,352
So there will be no overnight parking.

1631
02:11:45,912 --> 02:11:46,473
Correct.

1632
02:11:46,973 --> 02:11:48,215
In that garage with these people.

1633
02:11:51,401 --> 02:11:57,585
So just to clarify, no personal vehicle will be parked overnight in the parking garage.

1634
02:11:59,146 --> 02:12:02,048
There'll be no personal parking in that garage, correct?

1635
02:12:02,508 --> 02:12:02,728
Yes.

1636
02:12:03,689 --> 02:12:08,231
And you're saying that all everyone that goes to pick up those 80 cars are being dropped off, correct?

1637
02:12:08,652 --> 02:12:09,052
That's correct.

1638
02:12:10,750 --> 02:12:13,352
Okay, and again, I don't have a problem supporting the show.

1639
02:12:13,812 --> 02:12:19,798
It does provide any more jobs for people with this new gig economy.

1640
02:12:20,618 --> 02:12:26,463
I'm familiar with Uber has a problem with Hertz.

1641
02:12:26,964 --> 02:12:27,704
It does the same thing.

1642
02:12:29,083 --> 02:12:31,665
And that's where those guys get their cars from.

1643
02:12:32,145 --> 02:12:41,691
So I don't have a problem supporting this as long as we're getting the excise taxes and those people are not parking their cars on any of our streets.

1644
02:12:42,211 --> 02:12:47,114
And if they do leave their car, I would hope that they'll pay to park them in that garage there.

1645
02:12:50,954 --> 02:12:51,915
Thank you, Councilor Caravello.

1646
02:12:51,955 --> 02:12:52,675
Councilor Sang.

1647
02:12:54,116 --> 02:12:59,078
Councilor Caravello and Councilor Unite have asked two of the questions I was gonna ask.

1648
02:12:59,939 --> 02:13:08,723
I think it would help me to get a sense of how many cars, because there are gonna be cars that are going out, right?

1649
02:13:09,624 --> 02:13:10,184
Being rented.

1650
02:13:11,585 --> 02:13:15,107
How many cars do you envision being in those spaces at a given time?

1651
02:13:15,527 --> 02:13:16,187
Just an average.

1652
02:13:18,369 --> 02:13:19,709
In the auxiliary parking?

1653
02:13:20,530 --> 02:13:20,690
Yeah.

1654
02:13:21,876 --> 02:13:31,726
Um, it's hard to say, but our goal is I mean, obviously, our goal is always to not have any vehicles in those parking spaces, because that means that we are at a high utilization rate.

1655
02:13:32,326 --> 02:13:41,175
And again, being by appointment only, it's easy for us to keep our utilization rate down, because we are keeping track of who wants, you know, the next vehicle.

1656
02:13:41,575 --> 02:13:47,019
So we don't usually have overstock a vehicle sitting there for somebody to be able to come up and take that vehicle.

1657
02:13:48,100 --> 02:13:51,463
So I know that doesn't answer your question because it does fluctuate kind of depending on time of year.

1658
02:13:52,003 --> 02:14:00,510
But I mean, if I had to throw a number out there, I would say somewhere on the range of maybe 20 to 30 vehicles in the parking garage.

1659
02:14:00,550 --> 02:14:01,851
But again, that does fluctuate.

1660
02:14:02,412 --> 02:14:03,953
And hopefully it would be at zero.

1661
02:14:06,404 --> 02:14:08,145
Okay, thank you for the answer.

1662
02:14:08,725 --> 02:14:30,220
I think one benefit that hasn't been talked about is that this would lower the need, like people's, Lyft drivers need to buy vehicles, which means that, you know, that's better for parking in general in the area, in the greater Boston area, better for the environment.

1663
02:14:30,380 --> 02:14:34,523
But of course we have these other considerations that we have to think about as well.

1664
02:14:36,743 --> 02:14:37,584
Thank you, Councillor Sang.

1665
02:14:37,644 --> 02:14:39,285
Any further comments from members of the Council?

1666
02:14:39,305 --> 02:14:44,691
I have a couple questions myself.

1667
02:14:45,351 --> 02:14:49,395
Just so I get this right, is FlexDrive Services LLC owned by Lyft?

1668
02:14:50,917 --> 02:14:51,637
It's a subsidiary.

1669
02:14:52,758 --> 02:14:53,919
Is it a wholly owned subsidiary?

1670
02:14:56,240 --> 02:15:02,203
Yes, so my question here relates to the business model.

1671
02:15:02,824 --> 02:15:04,745
You mentioned onboarding of drivers.

1672
02:15:06,205 --> 02:15:09,767
Are drivers employees of Lyft or FlexDrive Services LLC?

1673
02:15:12,969 --> 02:15:14,370
Can you repeat that question one more time?

1674
02:15:15,210 --> 02:15:23,095
Are the Lyft drivers you discussed, are they employees either of FlexDrive Services LLC or employees of Lyft as a corporation?

1675
02:15:24,455 --> 02:15:25,056
They are...

1676
02:15:28,198 --> 02:15:30,859
Well, they're not, they're on the platform.

1677
02:15:30,900 --> 02:15:32,480
They're utilizing the platform.

1678
02:15:33,721 --> 02:15:35,682
They're independent contractors.

1679
02:15:35,762 --> 02:15:38,064
Independent contractor utilizing the platform.

1680
02:15:39,024 --> 02:15:44,167
Is there any guarantee that if a contractor, I mean, I just have some serious questions here.

1681
02:15:44,187 --> 02:15:50,430
You're giving them the platform and you're renting them the car, but there's no guarantee they make the minimum wage.

1682
02:15:50,490 --> 02:15:51,111
Is that correct?

1683
02:15:52,452 --> 02:15:53,972
I can't really speak to that.

1684
02:15:55,623 --> 02:15:57,004
That's a yes or no question.

1685
02:15:57,244 --> 02:15:58,425
It depends on how many hours they work.

1686
02:15:58,465 --> 02:16:01,367
Give me a car and a job.

1687
02:16:02,227 --> 02:16:03,808
If they work the hours, they can make the money, right?

1688
02:16:03,968 --> 02:16:04,829
Okay, let me rephrase this.

1689
02:16:04,909 --> 02:16:13,334
What happens if a Lyft driver rents the car, but is unable to make the payment for the rental for whatever reason, because the income isn't enough from the app?

1690
02:16:14,535 --> 02:16:20,639
Well, the vehicle, just to clarify, so the vehicle can be used for also personal driving.

1691
02:16:20,679 --> 02:16:22,660
So if somebody wants to utilize it

1692
02:16:23,177 --> 02:16:33,281
you know, for obviously their own personal reasons, or if they want to utilize it to be on, you know, like, let's say a different food service provider, they can do that.

1693
02:16:33,661 --> 02:16:37,763
So they can rent from us and be able to use the vehicle for any other uses.

1694
02:16:40,164 --> 02:16:43,205
What, you know, in terms of rental, do they pay a flat fee?

1695
02:16:43,225 --> 02:16:44,866
Do they pay by the mile?

1696
02:16:45,786 --> 02:16:49,668
Is it more competitive or less competitive than say, renting a car from Hertz?

1697
02:16:52,083 --> 02:16:52,844
There are benefits.

1698
02:16:52,964 --> 02:17:01,129
The more that the driver drives on the platform, there are benefits to the amount of hours that they're working on the platform.

1699
02:17:02,870 --> 02:17:10,015
But I guess my question is, if they rent from you, is it cheaper than if they just rent it from any old rental company?

1700
02:17:10,595 --> 02:17:11,276
That is the goal.

1701
02:17:12,116 --> 02:17:12,637
That is correct.

1702
02:17:13,878 --> 02:17:14,158
OK.

1703
02:17:15,299 --> 02:17:17,180
Well, I'll just leave my questions there.

1704
02:17:17,480 --> 02:17:20,482
I have, again, some serious qualms about this kind

1705
02:17:22,188 --> 02:17:27,550
Um, any further comments by members of the council Councilor Collins.

1706
02:17:29,110 --> 02:17:29,570
Thank you.

1707
02:17:29,690 --> 02:17:32,111
Yeah, I appreciate the petitioner being before us tonight.

1708
02:17:32,131 --> 02:17:33,931
I appreciate the motion to table as well.

1709
02:17:33,971 --> 02:17:37,872
I think this is a matter I'd want to give some additional consideration to.

1710
02:17:37,932 --> 02:17:43,394
I think that the point is well noted that this, um, company or its subsidiary already exists in Medford and there haven't been

1711
02:17:44,555 --> 02:17:49,243
grave consequences noted that they've been a pretty good neighbor in the business community.

1712
02:17:50,304 --> 02:17:55,973
But I think for myself, you know, it's hard for me as a representative to

1713
02:17:59,891 --> 02:18:13,481
further enmesh, you know, the subcontractor based economy in our community, knowing that there's no way of regulating, you know, if these are competitive with living wages, if these are, you know, as good of jobs as our local residents really deserve.

1714
02:18:13,862 --> 02:18:15,483
So that's not at all a reflection on the petitioner.

1715
02:18:15,823 --> 02:18:16,383
here before us.

1716
02:18:16,443 --> 02:18:18,024
I really appreciate the work you've put into this.

1717
02:18:18,944 --> 02:18:21,165
It's something I want to give more thought to.

1718
02:18:21,726 --> 02:18:27,288
I think it's the issue of, you know, the day-to-day, the traffic impact, the impact on this specific neighborhood.

1719
02:18:27,768 --> 02:18:34,471
And in addition, you know, what type of businesses do we want to be making up our business ecosystem here in our community?

1720
02:18:34,711 --> 02:18:34,971
Thank you.

1721
02:18:35,932 --> 02:18:36,712
Thank you, Councilor Collins.

1722
02:18:36,752 --> 02:18:37,772
Councilor Caravaglio.

1723
02:18:37,812 --> 02:18:38,833
Thank you, Mr. President.

1724
02:18:38,973 --> 02:18:42,875
Let it be known that City of Bedford derives money

1725
02:18:43,847 --> 02:18:46,989
from every ride share service that originates here.

1726
02:18:47,449 --> 02:19:00,335
And I think if we look back, see how much money is, how many rides start here, it's a decent sum of money that we receive really doing nothing.

1727
02:19:01,736 --> 02:19:08,720
I know Boston gets more than we do, but we do derive money from every ride share service that originates in the city of Medford.

1728
02:19:11,181 --> 02:19:12,041
Thank you, Councilor Kerrio.

1729
02:19:12,081 --> 02:19:12,902
Any further comments?

1730
02:19:13,486 --> 02:19:19,409
I just have a couple of more questions to a friend of sunny California might not be sunny there anymore at 630.

1731
02:19:20,369 --> 02:19:31,474
But what are the requirements to be a Lyft driver in Massachusetts, where you need a driver's license in a vehicle right.

1732
02:19:33,395 --> 02:19:39,278
I apologize I was on mute.

1733
02:19:41,535 --> 02:19:42,376
Okay, thank you.

1734
02:19:43,097 --> 02:19:43,838
Yes, that is correct.

1735
02:19:44,999 --> 02:19:49,024
Okay, and if I have a driver's license, but I don't have a vehicle, can I be a Lyft driver?

1736
02:19:52,188 --> 02:19:57,474
Yes, if you buy in on the program, if you you can rent a vehicle from us, and then yes.

1737
02:19:58,075 --> 02:19:59,637
So it does give business to

1738
02:20:01,708 --> 02:20:04,070
to individuals who are unfortunate don't have a vehicle.

1739
02:20:04,751 --> 02:20:11,717
And this allows someone to be able to start earnings or start creating earnings based off of being able to rent a vehicle from us.

1740
02:20:13,039 --> 02:20:13,659
Excellent, excellent.

1741
02:20:13,679 --> 02:20:16,502
So ultimately, this also gives people who don't have the

1742
02:20:18,809 --> 02:20:20,731
driver's license, the opportunity to get a job and work.

1743
02:20:21,051 --> 02:20:22,593
That's correct.

1744
02:20:22,633 --> 02:20:23,034
All right.

1745
02:20:23,154 --> 02:20:23,374
Excellent.

1746
02:20:23,394 --> 02:20:23,874
Thank you very much.

1747
02:20:24,695 --> 02:20:28,679
I would again suggest so I there's no one else to speak.

1748
02:20:28,720 --> 02:20:33,004
I think the important piece right now is very is twofold.

1749
02:20:33,024 --> 02:20:40,892
The understanding of getting some questions answered and making sure this council at one point wasn't represented

1750
02:20:41,853 --> 02:20:50,115
when there was a special permit requested by a legal team, and when we denied it for a reason that we couldn't, we were then sued.

1751
02:20:50,696 --> 02:21:00,658
So the reason why I want to make sure that we don't do anything until we get the word from legal that one way or the other.

1752
02:21:00,718 --> 02:21:02,999
So I know I appreciate the representative from Lyft.

1753
02:21:03,919 --> 02:21:05,160
It's a lot of great questions.

1754
02:21:07,555 --> 02:21:09,295
Councilor Caviello brings up some great points.

1755
02:21:09,315 --> 02:21:22,839
I understand the benefit for taxable revenue through the excise tax, but I just want to make sure there are some questions that I have legally on our end before.

1756
02:21:24,879 --> 02:21:27,300
My recommendation.

1757
02:21:28,500 --> 02:21:29,601
May I take public participation?

1758
02:21:29,981 --> 02:21:30,201
Sure.

1759
02:21:31,281 --> 02:21:32,641
Take public participation.

1760
02:21:33,762 --> 02:21:35,122
Please give your name and address for the record.

1761
02:21:35,665 --> 02:21:38,427
William Navar, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

1762
02:21:38,447 --> 02:21:41,509
I just had a question for the representative.

1763
02:21:42,130 --> 02:21:54,939
If a driver participates in this program, does this lock the bid to use Lyft as a driver only and they're not allowed to use Uber, their own ride for hire business card or whatever?

1764
02:21:54,959 --> 02:21:59,823
Are they required to be sort of exclusively with Lyft?

1765
02:22:00,103 --> 02:22:00,363
Thanks.

1766
02:22:00,383 --> 02:22:05,227
So to answer that question, it is not exclusive to Lyft.

1767
02:22:07,883 --> 02:22:11,804
they can use it for personal or any other service that they would like.

1768
02:22:13,344 --> 02:22:18,845
So my recommendation would be that now that I have these questions that I can, I would table for two weeks.

1769
02:22:19,565 --> 02:22:25,647
And hopefully the city administration can have someone through the legal team just answer a question.

1770
02:22:25,667 --> 02:22:26,727
I'll reach out to them tomorrow.

1771
02:22:27,087 --> 02:22:29,988
So my recommendation right now I don't feel comfortable to go to a vote with this.

1772
02:22:30,448 --> 02:22:31,808
So it has to table for two weeks.

1773
02:22:32,108 --> 02:22:36,771
Motion to table for two weeks by Councilor Scarpelli, pending legal review.

1774
02:22:36,911 --> 02:22:40,454
Would you be comfortable amending that to request that legal counsel be present at our meeting in two weeks?

1775
02:22:40,474 --> 02:22:41,355
If they could, that'd be great.

1776
02:22:41,655 --> 02:22:41,875
Thank you.

1777
02:22:41,895 --> 02:22:47,859
So on the motion to table for two weeks and request that legal counsel be present at our next meeting, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1778
02:22:48,439 --> 02:22:49,300
All those in favor?

1779
02:22:50,141 --> 02:22:50,621
Opposed?

1780
02:22:51,281 --> 02:22:52,362
Motion passes to table.

1781
02:22:53,543 --> 02:22:56,945
Can we also make the same motion relative to paper 22-538?

1782
02:22:56,985 --> 02:22:57,126
Yes.

1783
02:23:00,067 --> 02:23:05,130
On the motion of Councilor Knight to table 22-538 for two weeks seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1784
02:23:05,670 --> 02:23:06,431
All those in favor.

1785
02:23:07,291 --> 02:23:07,752
Opposed.

1786
02:23:08,652 --> 02:23:09,713
Motion passes.

1787
02:23:09,733 --> 02:23:13,235
What was our next one?

1788
02:23:13,255 --> 02:23:13,235
540?

1789
02:23:17,838 --> 02:23:21,260
540.

1790
02:23:17,858 --> 02:23:21,260
22-540 to President Morrell and honorable members of the Medford City Council.

1791
02:23:23,007 --> 02:23:33,655
from mayor brand logo current re food truck permit for Medford Square meter project celebration date, October 5th, 2022 on behalf of the below entity, I respectfully submit the following requests for food truck permit in the city of Medford.

1792
02:23:35,717 --> 02:23:39,160
In addition to city council approval vendors are required to adhere to health department food safety requirements.

1793
02:23:39,400 --> 02:23:41,321
One Zach's ice cream truck, not mine.

1794
02:23:41,341 --> 02:23:45,244
Date and time Thursday, October 20th, 2022, 12 p.m.

1795
02:23:45,544 --> 02:23:46,945
to 3 p.m.

1796
02:23:47,005 --> 02:23:49,748
location, Medford city hall parking lot looks like

1797
02:23:50,428 --> 02:23:58,834
the West Rear parking lot event celebration of the completion of the Medford Square meter project about the event on Thursday, October 20th, 2022.

1798
02:23:58,894 --> 02:24:05,019
The parking department will host an event to celebrate the completion of the installation of new meters throughout Medford Square.

1799
02:24:05,579 --> 02:24:06,380
Thank you for your attention.

1800
02:24:06,420 --> 02:24:07,261
This matter sincerely.

1801
02:24:07,341 --> 02:24:08,822
I missed that.

1802
02:24:08,962 --> 02:24:10,483
Can you say what this was for again?

1803
02:24:10,823 --> 02:24:13,826
It's about the event on Thursday, October 20th, 2022.

1804
02:24:13,886 --> 02:24:18,909
The parking department will host an event to celebrate the completion of the installation of new meters throughout Medford Square.

1805
02:24:19,730 --> 02:24:21,999
to have an ice cream to celebrate Paca Minas.

1806
02:24:23,183 --> 02:24:24,784
Councilor Newton.

1807
02:24:24,844 --> 02:24:31,307
I'm just trying to figure this out because this sounds like the most tone deaf proposal I have ever witnessed by this administration to date.

1808
02:24:33,088 --> 02:24:38,250
After the last four weeks, the last month and a half, six weeks.

1809
02:24:38,970 --> 02:24:46,234
You tell me how many months we've been talking about parking and what's going on with parking and how terrible the program is and how many failures have been with this program.

1810
02:24:46,654 --> 02:24:50,796
And we're going to have an ice cream social to celebrate these failures?

1811
02:24:51,196 --> 02:24:52,617
As I said, not my ice cream truck.

1812
02:24:53,385 --> 02:24:54,166
I wish it were.

1813
02:24:56,227 --> 02:25:02,933
As crazy as I think this is, you want to know what makes it even crazier?

1814
02:25:03,714 --> 02:25:08,618
We're using Zach's ice cream truck, which is out of Everett, which is out of Everett.

1815
02:25:09,856 --> 02:25:14,158
I don't know why the Chamber of Commerce is down here saying, why aren't we using Colleen's?

1816
02:25:14,779 --> 02:25:16,920
Why aren't we using CB Schools?

1817
02:25:16,940 --> 02:25:25,144
These are the businesses that are in our community, that during the pandemic and everything, they stepped up, help people day in and day out.

1818
02:25:25,804 --> 02:25:29,526
Every time an organization needs something, what do they go to?

1819
02:25:30,106 --> 02:25:31,807
They go to Colleen's, they go to CB Schools.

1820
02:25:32,067 --> 02:25:33,448
Hey, can you help us out with the gift certificate?

1821
02:25:33,468 --> 02:25:34,288
Can you help us out with that?

1822
02:25:34,648 --> 02:25:36,990
And here we are, I don't know who's paying Zach,

1823
02:25:37,926 --> 02:25:38,326
Not you.

1824
02:25:39,067 --> 02:25:45,972
I don't know who's paying Zach's Ice Cream to come here, but why aren't we using an ice cream company from our own city?

1825
02:25:46,433 --> 02:25:48,154
We had Oktoberfest on Saturday.

1826
02:25:48,414 --> 02:25:49,895
Who was out there with the big stand?

1827
02:25:50,216 --> 02:25:50,936
Colleens.

1828
02:25:52,117 --> 02:25:54,339
We had the Hoops of Dreams out there.

1829
02:25:54,579 --> 02:25:55,200
Who was out there?

1830
02:25:55,480 --> 02:25:57,481
CB Scoops, okay?

1831
02:25:57,842 --> 02:25:59,383
Ice Cream Social, Leprechaun Family Network.

1832
02:25:59,443 --> 02:26:02,085
Yeah, Leprechaun Family Network, the Ice Cream Social.

1833
02:26:03,849 --> 02:26:04,670
do CB scoops.

1834
02:26:06,330 --> 02:26:07,711
I've done ice cream socials.

1835
02:26:09,152 --> 02:26:16,356
I don't understand why we're not, as crazy as I think this is, why we're not using a method company to do this.

1836
02:26:17,057 --> 02:26:20,799
Shame on the shame of commerce for not being here tonight, saying something about this.

1837
02:26:21,239 --> 02:26:23,881
Given the expected attendance, they could have gone to a stop and shop.

1838
02:26:24,421 --> 02:26:25,201
Councillor Scarpelli.

1839
02:26:26,162 --> 02:26:28,483
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

1840
02:26:28,523 --> 02:26:30,284
I appreciate my colleagues.

1841
02:26:30,685 --> 02:26:30,985
I don't

1842
02:26:32,952 --> 02:26:43,699
The intent for this format is to come through us to give a permit for a special event.

1843
02:26:44,780 --> 02:26:55,306
And so far, special events for, for instance, the Harvest Fest, which we would support, the fundraiser for a school,

1844
02:26:57,329 --> 02:27:11,054
And the biggest thing we talked about over and over again, and I think everybody, everybody, including, including the mayor who sat right here when I said a thousand times, if it affects brick and mortar businesses, we shouldn't support them.

1845
02:27:12,395 --> 02:27:12,715
Okay.

1846
02:27:13,315 --> 02:27:15,476
And there is, I don't, I still don't understand

1847
02:27:16,682 --> 02:27:20,264
Okay, let's say the META program is a huge success.

1848
02:27:20,785 --> 02:27:22,686
The city has rallied around it.

1849
02:27:22,866 --> 02:27:24,267
Everybody is super excited.

1850
02:27:24,687 --> 02:27:25,888
We're gonna celebrate this.

1851
02:27:25,928 --> 02:27:27,329
There are gonna be hundreds of people here.

1852
02:27:29,431 --> 02:27:35,895
Is there anybody here to tell us, is Zach's ice cream truck going to charge the individual?

1853
02:27:36,215 --> 02:27:37,836
Is the city picking up the fee?

1854
02:27:39,177 --> 02:27:40,018
Does anybody know that?

1855
02:27:40,758 --> 02:27:42,780
Mr. Clerk, do we have a representative of the administration?

1856
02:27:46,486 --> 02:27:46,966
Yeah, why not?

1857
02:27:48,887 --> 02:27:50,167
Present your ticket, get an ice cream.

1858
02:27:50,207 --> 02:27:51,847
Is that what it says?

1859
02:27:51,867 --> 02:27:58,329
Present your ticket, get an ice cream.

1860
02:27:59,029 --> 02:28:00,149
Oh, your parking ticket.

1861
02:28:00,169 --> 02:28:01,370
I mean, listen, honestly, come on.

1862
02:28:01,430 --> 02:28:03,330
Is Ashton Kutcher, where's Ashton Kutcher?

1863
02:28:03,350 --> 02:28:03,870
Is he coming out?

1864
02:28:03,910 --> 02:28:06,051
Are we being pumped right now, like seriously?

1865
02:28:06,491 --> 02:28:07,431
Does this really happen?

1866
02:28:07,451 --> 02:28:08,691
And this is what our government does?

1867
02:28:09,711 --> 02:28:11,052
I just wanted to be the vice president.

1868
02:28:11,072 --> 02:28:13,012
I don't know what you're doing.

1869
02:28:13,032 --> 02:28:15,673
I mean, this is like the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard in my life.

1870
02:28:16,402 --> 02:28:19,584
Yeah, I know we're making light of this, but I'm gonna be honest with you.

1871
02:28:20,745 --> 02:28:23,667
In all seriousness, this is disappointing.

1872
02:28:25,268 --> 02:28:28,230
I know we're joking and laughing about it, but are you kidding me?

1873
02:28:28,250 --> 02:28:32,292
I had teachers call me today because they're working to rule.

1874
02:28:32,312 --> 02:28:35,154
Now that's not good for both ends.

1875
02:28:36,355 --> 02:28:44,120
You have kids that are not gonna be given the services they need because teachers are that frustrated that they're not working to rule, so when 230 hits, they're home.

1876
02:28:46,008 --> 02:28:50,333
And I understand that this is funny, but this is funny disgusting.

1877
02:28:52,516 --> 02:29:00,225
Let's have an ice cream truck unveil, celebrate something we just talked about that's turning the city upside down.

1878
02:29:01,126 --> 02:29:03,708
We've had nothing but complaints and anger.

1879
02:29:06,096 --> 02:29:12,658
You know what, if the director will come here for four hours to discuss issues, I will vote on an ice cream truck to be parked right out here.

1880
02:29:13,238 --> 02:29:16,639
As long as someone's right there answering the questions that I have to answer every night.

1881
02:29:17,759 --> 02:29:18,499
I'm disgusted.

1882
02:29:20,400 --> 02:29:21,900
I apologize.

1883
02:29:23,161 --> 02:29:24,941
This is something, I love this city.

1884
02:29:25,501 --> 02:29:28,462
I love the city, but this is becoming a laughing stock.

1885
02:29:28,782 --> 02:29:32,043
This is a joke asking for ice cream.

1886
02:29:33,473 --> 02:29:36,734
So my vote to be no, I would deny this permit.

1887
02:29:38,374 --> 02:29:39,294
Thank you, Councilor Schell.

1888
02:29:39,314 --> 02:29:40,334
Councilor Collins, Councilor Smith.

1889
02:29:42,775 --> 02:29:43,415
Thank you very much.

1890
02:29:43,815 --> 02:29:55,457
I was waffling back and forth on how to vote on this motion now that it's before us.

1891
02:29:55,617 --> 02:30:02,318
And I had been thinking, just to speak candidly, I mentioned earlier, I think that,

1892
02:30:03,015 --> 02:30:14,487
We're all acutely aware of the many problems with the parking department and the ways that that's manifested into the lives of our residents and business owners into the community.

1893
02:30:15,207 --> 02:30:24,116
And I also think that some of the ways in which that flack has been levied upon the parking department to the exclusion of higher ups in the city administration is not quite fair.

1894
02:30:24,377 --> 02:30:25,178
So I have been thinking,

1895
02:30:27,113 --> 02:30:29,134
you know, why spread the grief around?

1896
02:30:29,354 --> 02:30:46,480
I know from talking to staff in the parking department that as flawed and fraught as this parking meter repair project has been, you know, it was a lot of work to repair kiosks that had been broken and in disrepair because of Reef Republic for years.

1897
02:30:47,040 --> 02:30:52,382
Why not let them, you know, why not say yes to something immaterial?

1898
02:30:52,622 --> 02:30:54,643
However, the more I think about it,

1899
02:30:57,960 --> 02:31:00,261
you know, everybody in the city works really hard.

1900
02:31:00,601 --> 02:31:04,404
I think that everybody who works in City Hall deserves an ice cream social for their efforts.

1901
02:31:05,224 --> 02:31:07,805
But I think that but please let me finish.

1902
02:31:08,326 --> 02:31:09,026
Please let me finish.

1903
02:31:09,526 --> 02:31:19,652
I think that if we're talking about giving staff what they're due for their hard work, what I'd really like to see for the parking department is a bargained contract, you know, the recognition of their union.

1904
02:31:20,427 --> 02:31:25,111
I think that what these staff members deserve, because regardless of the outcome, we know that they're working hard.

1905
02:31:25,131 --> 02:31:27,673
What they deserve is not an ice cream social.

1906
02:31:28,253 --> 02:31:30,615
What they deserve is fair bargaining with this administration.

1907
02:31:32,076 --> 02:31:34,118
You know, this is the chain of thought that's changed my mind.

1908
02:31:34,418 --> 02:31:40,963
I don't want to keep more grief upon an embattled department, as flawed as it may be, but this isn't what they deserve.

1909
02:31:40,983 --> 02:31:44,866
You know, parking is not what we deserve, but this isn't the reward that they deserve.

1910
02:31:44,886 --> 02:31:48,989
What they deserve is fair working conditions, not a,

1911
02:31:51,268 --> 02:31:52,050
a little pool party.

1912
02:31:53,112 --> 02:31:53,412
Thank you.

1913
02:31:53,813 --> 02:31:55,116
Thank you.

1914
02:31:56,178 --> 02:32:01,308
I think we might be used to things like this, you know,

1915
02:32:02,575 --> 02:32:05,276
feeling like there is going to receive a rubber stamp approval.

1916
02:32:05,736 --> 02:32:20,563
Moving on, I mean it's clear from the conversation tonight it's not but I do think it's important to go back to the reason why we have these special events and celebrations, which is that, you know, we want to unite the city and we want to bring vibrancy, but the problem is this.

1917
02:32:21,423 --> 02:32:26,747
meter project is an embellished project that doesn't necessarily unite our community.

1918
02:32:27,087 --> 02:32:44,518
And, you know, a simple celebration like this isn't necessarily going to improve vibrancy that much, unlike Oktoberfest, which this weekend brought together, I think, residents of all different backgrounds and gave families a place to go.

1919
02:32:46,079 --> 02:32:49,562
My second concern with the project, or with the special events

1920
02:32:50,222 --> 02:33:07,664
like this is that it's Panama and Kyrgyzstan, which is bread and circuses, you know, we buy by, you know, by having these celebrations, I think it's really easy to mask the problems that exist here in City Hall, the problems that exist with our policy.

1921
02:33:08,144 --> 02:33:11,385
and the problems with how we treat workers.

1922
02:33:11,545 --> 02:33:20,388
And, you know, I think it's really important that we use this platform and that we say, you know, we can't keep masking our problems with city celebrations and press releases.

1923
02:33:20,428 --> 02:33:28,371
We need to actually tackle these really hard hitting issues head on to have that maturity of the leadership to do that.

1924
02:33:32,657 --> 02:33:32,977
It's great.

1925
02:33:33,317 --> 02:33:33,657
Thank you.

1926
02:33:33,717 --> 02:33:35,378
Councillor saying that was great.

1927
02:33:35,838 --> 02:33:40,379
Hey, well, and I just want to say one thing that petition sincerely brand a local current mayor.

1928
02:33:41,239 --> 02:33:42,499
This is submitted to us by the mayor.

1929
02:33:44,040 --> 02:33:53,722
Either no thought went into it, or this is before us because they wanted us to have a fight where then the parking department's mad at us because we didn't throw them an ice cream party.

1930
02:33:54,507 --> 02:33:56,649
You don't have to have a food truck to have an ice cream party.

1931
02:33:56,669 --> 02:34:03,114
You don't, you know, if you want to have an internal celebration in your department for the work that you're doing, you don't have to come to this council to ask us for permission to do it.

1932
02:34:03,655 --> 02:34:10,381
So either no thought went into it, or this isn't intentionally before us to make us have this conversation that we don't want to have.

1933
02:34:10,921 --> 02:34:13,784
I mean, and I don't know which one's worse to be honest.

1934
02:34:13,804 --> 02:34:15,425
Or alternative, or alternatively, right?

1935
02:34:15,465 --> 02:34:18,047
It's for, it's for, it's to create a pseudo,

1936
02:34:19,108 --> 02:34:41,592
look that there is support for this field right program right so that you can put it in a press release like Justin said right so we have pictures but look at the pictures it was an ice cream social and everybody had a great time right anytime the going gets tough there's a ribbon cutting have we seen that trend anytime the going gets tough there's a ribbon cutting I'm just saying if the goal there's a lot of ways to go about it that don't require this process

1937
02:34:43,292 --> 02:34:45,613
And I don't disagree with what everyone else said.

1938
02:34:45,673 --> 02:34:48,155
At least use a local company.

1939
02:34:48,175 --> 02:34:54,478
We have local vendors here who get hit up all the time for donations and everything.

1940
02:34:54,758 --> 02:34:59,321
And here we are, you've got some money to spend and you're spending it outside of the city of Bedford.

1941
02:35:00,248 --> 02:35:00,948
We don't even know that.

1942
02:35:01,008 --> 02:35:03,690
They might be charging the parking department to pay for ice cream.

1943
02:35:03,730 --> 02:35:05,891
Maybe Zach's Ice Cream is a hell of a nice guy.

1944
02:35:06,131 --> 02:35:07,131
He's going to do it for free.

1945
02:35:07,932 --> 02:35:12,234
Well, no, I'm saying we don't know that they're not charging people to buy ice cream from the truck.

1946
02:35:12,814 --> 02:35:15,875
And we don't know if this is for the employees, if this is for the city.

1947
02:35:15,896 --> 02:35:17,396
12 to 3.

1948
02:35:17,576 --> 02:35:18,777
Who's around the 12 to 3?

1949
02:35:19,297 --> 02:35:20,518
I'm just going to take it at this point.

1950
02:35:20,538 --> 02:35:22,919
It seems like there's general consensus that we have no idea what's going on.

1951
02:35:22,959 --> 02:35:23,879
Is there a motion on the floor?

1952
02:35:23,899 --> 02:35:24,920
No one has any idea what's going on.

1953
02:35:24,940 --> 02:35:25,680
Not to approve.

1954
02:35:25,860 --> 02:35:26,220
Second.

1955
02:35:26,481 --> 02:35:28,301
Motion to deny.

1956
02:35:28,542 --> 02:35:28,862
Deny.

1957
02:35:29,622 --> 02:35:32,703
by Councillor Knight, seconded by Councillor Scarpelli.

1958
02:35:33,703 --> 02:35:34,524
All those in favour?

1959
02:35:35,404 --> 02:35:35,924
Opposed?

1960
02:35:36,024 --> 02:35:41,366
Motion passes.

1961
02:35:41,386 --> 02:35:52,230
22-541, to President Morrell and honourable members of the Medford City Council, from Mayor Brianna Longo-Kern, re-food truck permit for Harvester Energy Festival, date October 5th, 2022, on behalf of the below entity.

1962
02:35:53,713 --> 02:35:58,134
I respectfully submit the following requests for a food truck permit in the city of Medford.

1963
02:35:58,174 --> 02:36:02,215
In addition to city council approval, vendors are required to adhere to health department food and safety requirements.

1964
02:36:03,496 --> 02:36:05,036
One, work hard, eat good, food truck.

1965
02:36:05,076 --> 02:36:08,217
Date and time, Saturday, October 15th, 2022, 12 p.m.

1966
02:36:08,257 --> 02:36:08,857
to 3 p.m.

1967
02:36:08,917 --> 02:36:12,318
Location, Riverbend Park behind McGlynn Middle School, Medford MA.

1968
02:36:13,098 --> 02:36:14,619
Event, Harvester Energy Festival.

1969
02:36:14,879 --> 02:36:19,960
On Saturday, October 15th, 2022, from 12 to 3 p.m., we'll be hosting the annual Harvester Energy Festival.

1970
02:36:21,373 --> 02:36:22,733
This festival is, huh?

1971
02:36:24,614 --> 02:36:27,574
You want me to finish reading it or?

1972
02:36:30,495 --> 02:36:33,896
Councillor Scarpelli, if you could, I'm gonna waive the rest of the reading and go to Councillor Scarpelli.

1973
02:36:33,916 --> 02:36:35,096
So thank you, Mr. Vice President.

1974
02:36:35,116 --> 02:36:37,497
I think that this is what it's entitled for.

1975
02:36:38,057 --> 02:36:38,817
This is what we do.

1976
02:36:38,897 --> 02:36:46,279
It's a special event to bring the whole community together, to push an event or process that we need to really spread the word.

1977
02:36:46,919 --> 02:36:50,640
And I would support this wholeheartedly, Mr. President.

1978
02:36:51,413 --> 02:36:52,454
a method companies, correct?

1979
02:36:52,474 --> 02:36:52,994
Thank you.

1980
02:36:53,094 --> 02:36:55,075
Councillor Scarpelli, Councillor Collins.

1981
02:36:55,195 --> 02:36:58,917
Is that a second or on the motion of Councillor Scarpelli to approve seconded by Councillor Collins.

1982
02:36:58,977 --> 02:36:59,618
All those in favor.

1983
02:37:00,338 --> 02:37:03,560
Opposed motion passes motion on the floor.

1984
02:37:07,982 --> 02:37:08,223
Yes.

1985
02:37:08,343 --> 02:37:11,765
We also have some folks here, maybe on a sign.

1986
02:37:12,525 --> 02:37:14,226
So we'll do the traffic supervisor.

1987
02:37:14,246 --> 02:37:20,950
Then we'll go to signs on the motion of Councillor Knight to take paper two, two dash five zero three off the table.

1988
02:37:23,382 --> 02:37:24,863
seconded by Councilor Carviello.

1989
02:37:24,903 --> 02:37:25,643
All those in favor?

1990
02:37:26,323 --> 02:37:26,883
All those opposed?

1991
02:37:26,923 --> 02:37:27,683
Motion passes.

1992
02:37:27,703 --> 02:37:34,665
22-503 is personnel ordinance, a union contract with the traffic supervisors that has been agreed to by all parties.

1993
02:37:35,445 --> 02:37:43,626
This was in city council September 13th, 2022 for first reading, advertised in the Metro transcript September 29th, 2022 for second reading and is eligible for third reading tonight.

1994
02:37:44,527 --> 02:37:48,828
On the motion of Councilor Knight to approve for third reading, seconded by Councilor Collins.

1995
02:37:49,708 --> 02:37:50,708
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1996
02:38:23,359 --> 02:38:25,160
Thank you for bearing with me.

1997
02:38:25,200 --> 02:38:27,421
This is to approve the contract for third reading to be ordained.

1998
02:38:29,162 --> 02:38:29,783
Councilor Kerrio?

1999
02:38:29,983 --> 02:38:30,123
Yes.

2000
02:38:31,964 --> 02:38:32,525
Councilor Collins?

2001
02:38:32,845 --> 02:38:33,025
Yes.

2002
02:38:33,845 --> 02:38:34,346
Councilor Knight?

2003
02:38:34,406 --> 02:38:34,586
Yes.

2004
02:38:35,246 --> 02:38:35,907
Councilor Scarpelli?

2005
02:38:36,147 --> 02:38:36,387
Yes.

2006
02:38:36,787 --> 02:38:37,347
Councilor Sang?

2007
02:38:37,548 --> 02:38:37,728
Yes.

2008
02:38:38,388 --> 02:38:39,409
President Morrell is absent.

2009
02:38:40,409 --> 02:38:41,130
Vice President Behrs?

2010
02:38:41,230 --> 02:38:43,131
Yes, 16 affirmative, one absent.

2011
02:38:43,151 --> 02:38:46,673
The motion passes for third reading, or the ordinance is passed to third reading.

2012
02:38:49,026 --> 02:38:55,628
Paper 22-539, petition for a sign denial reversal, Needham Bank, 270 Mystic Avenue, Medford MA 02155.

2013
02:38:56,368 --> 02:39:00,589
We have a petition before us for the reversal of a sign denial.

2014
02:39:00,609 --> 02:39:05,490
It seems like we have some petitioners in front of us.

2015
02:39:05,530 --> 02:39:10,471
If you could come to the podium and give us your name and address for the record, please, and give us a presentation.

2016
02:39:15,469 --> 02:39:17,070
represent members of the City Council.

2017
02:39:17,391 --> 02:39:18,491
My name is Richard Batten.

2018
02:39:18,511 --> 02:39:23,495
I'm from Batten Brothers Sign Company and 893 Main Street in Wakefield, Massachusetts.

2019
02:39:24,696 --> 02:39:26,418
And I'm representing Needham Bank

2020
02:39:27,265 --> 02:39:45,450
Uh Needham Bank is in the process of moving from 400 Mystic Ave to a new building that well existing building, but a new office for them at 270 Mystic Ave, which is the intersection of Mystic Valley Parkway, Mystic Ave and Harvard Street.

2021
02:39:46,758 --> 02:39:59,302
What we're requesting, well, what they're doing there is essentially building a new branch and renovating the building and giving it a much more modern, nicer appearance.

2022
02:40:00,502 --> 02:40:02,543
They're gonna be doing a lot of renovations there.

2023
02:40:03,623 --> 02:40:11,185
And they really feel like this is a very high profile location for them and very important to their business and hopefully to the city.

2024
02:40:13,186 --> 02:40:13,666
Because of the...

2025
02:40:14,626 --> 02:40:22,653
the nature of that intersection, what we're requesting is to have a primary, to have signs on four sides of the building.

2026
02:40:23,472 --> 02:40:33,961
The signs that we're requesting are comprised of white individual letters with a maroon and white logo, which is their standard logo.

2027
02:40:35,322 --> 02:40:47,131
The relative scope of the sign in relationship to the building is not overbearing or intrusive.

2028
02:40:47,651 --> 02:40:51,875
The goal of the signs is to

2029
02:40:52,536 --> 02:40:56,265
service, identification for people that are traveling.

2030
02:40:56,973 --> 02:41:12,785
because the entrance to that branch, as you probably well know, is either from Mystic Ave or from the Parkway, and it's difficult for people coming from different directions to know what the branch is.

2031
02:41:13,085 --> 02:41:22,412
In effect, if we only had one sign on that branch, or one primary sign and a small secondary sign, it would be somewhat invisible.

2032
02:41:23,517 --> 02:41:31,221
The signs we're requesting are similar to their signs that have been previously approved for Rockland Trust and for Central Bank before.

2033
02:41:32,442 --> 02:41:40,246
And as a matter of fact, I think Rockland Trust actually had two signs on one side of the building.

2034
02:41:40,346 --> 02:41:43,728
Central Bank, prior to them, had signs on each side of the building.

2035
02:41:44,248 --> 02:41:51,452
So we humbly request approval of our sign package.

2036
02:41:52,747 --> 02:41:53,248
Thank you.

2037
02:41:53,729 --> 02:41:55,834
Councillor Carvillo and then Councillor Schell.

2038
02:42:03,746 --> 02:42:05,287
There are no moving signs.

2039
02:42:05,427 --> 02:42:13,251
We initially had thought of putting a pylon sign on the corner there, but we've decided against that.

2040
02:42:13,531 --> 02:42:22,615
And the pylon sign had a message there, but we opted to go this direction instead of that direction, so no moving signs.

2041
02:42:23,116 --> 02:42:26,777
Where that is in somewhat of a little bit of a neighborhood, is there, we'll start

2042
02:42:31,202 --> 02:42:33,324
say they'll probably be turned off somewhere around 11 p.m.

2043
02:42:40,842 --> 02:42:42,502
usually we run them.

2044
02:42:42,763 --> 02:42:49,664
Usually we run it on a time clock with a photo cell.

2045
02:42:50,124 --> 02:42:54,125
So it would say that any time after like, let's say 7 a.m.

2046
02:42:55,205 --> 02:42:57,485
that it gets dark out, it would turn on.

2047
02:42:58,265 --> 02:43:02,446
But in every case at 11 p.m.

2048
02:43:02,666 --> 02:43:04,127
it would be shut off.

2049
02:43:04,287 --> 02:43:04,647
Great.

2050
02:43:05,907 --> 02:43:06,607
Councilor Scarborough.

2051
02:43:07,713 --> 02:43:08,854
Thank you for being here tonight.

2052
02:43:08,874 --> 02:43:17,417
I'm sure you had a few laughs, but this is what's difficult for me as the chairperson for signs on the subcommittee.

2053
02:43:17,437 --> 02:43:21,718
I think that when I see something like this, I always made my first phone call to guess who?

2054
02:43:23,019 --> 02:43:26,180
Paul Moki, our building

2055
02:43:32,552 --> 02:43:42,234
I'm not with Paul retiring, and I know we were supposed to have a new director in place, but I haven't heard yet to ask some questions.

2056
02:43:42,294 --> 02:43:50,716
Now, I would normally listen to Paul, and he would say, George, this is X, Y, and Z, and answer those questions, and it would be finished.

2057
02:43:50,736 --> 02:43:54,057
So I'm battling right now because I don't see any...

2058
02:43:54,817 --> 02:43:57,758
I don't see any digital signs that are moving.

2059
02:43:57,778 --> 02:44:07,420
I don't see, you know, I know that so that the request is that we're adding more signs that are recommended and that the signs will be off at 11 o'clock.

2060
02:44:07,480 --> 02:44:08,560
I think that's important now.

2061
02:44:09,120 --> 02:44:16,722
Outside, do we have like, will you have around the parking lot enter signs or will there be anything that would distinguish people can understand that?

2062
02:44:17,524 --> 02:44:23,150
I'm sure that there'll be directional signs, small directional signs.

2063
02:44:23,170 --> 02:44:25,912
Okay, but it won't be anything that's illuminated or anything?

2064
02:44:25,932 --> 02:44:26,072
No.

2065
02:44:26,092 --> 02:44:26,773
Okay.

2066
02:44:27,634 --> 02:44:28,655
And this is what's difficult.

2067
02:44:28,695 --> 02:44:33,520
This is obviously a business that we want to support here in Medford.

2068
02:44:34,861 --> 02:44:41,969
a very professional sign company that has done their due diligence, read through everything.

2069
02:44:42,129 --> 02:44:42,950
It looks good to me.

2070
02:44:42,970 --> 02:44:52,120
I would tend to support it, but again, this is my inner battle, is that not having a building commissioner where I can get any

2071
02:44:53,281 --> 02:44:57,285
answer questions that I had and feel comfortable with my decision tonight.

2072
02:44:57,745 --> 02:44:59,027
I don't know if I could vote for it.

2073
02:44:59,067 --> 02:45:09,676
So this is why I yield to my council colleagues before I hear any other recommendations, but right now just I yield.

2074
02:45:10,803 --> 02:45:11,103
Thank you.

2075
02:45:11,123 --> 02:45:12,564
We don't have anyone from the administration on.

2076
02:45:12,784 --> 02:45:12,984
No.

2077
02:45:13,284 --> 02:45:14,424
Councilor Knight.

2078
02:45:15,045 --> 02:45:16,265
Mr. President, thank you very much.

2079
02:45:16,405 --> 02:45:17,746
And Mr. Batten, thank you for being here.

2080
02:45:19,486 --> 02:45:21,387
Another bank, Mr. Gav, shocker, right?

2081
02:45:22,148 --> 02:45:26,749
Ultimately, you know, this is an example of wasted opportunity.

2082
02:45:28,230 --> 02:45:39,014
This location was the site of a rather large scale proposal that would have created significant growth in this community, significant jobs in this community, and potentially significant housing in this community.

2083
02:45:39,535 --> 02:45:40,655
But the administration decided

2084
02:45:44,807 --> 02:45:47,749
to bring this corner into a different state.

2085
02:45:48,649 --> 02:45:50,390
So with that being said, we're stuck with what we're stuck with.

2086
02:45:50,890 --> 02:46:00,755
And I'm not saying that a bank is a bad thing, because a bank does bring us jobs, jobs that pay a living wage, jobs that provide health insurance, jobs that you can provide for a family with, right?

2087
02:46:01,175 --> 02:46:09,980
So the next best alternative, right, is to bring jobs here that are going to be sustainable, that are going to be well paying enough where people can raise their

2088
02:46:13,076 --> 02:46:15,278
We missed the boat with the development.

2089
02:46:15,839 --> 02:46:17,841
The existing use is a bank.

2090
02:46:19,583 --> 02:46:20,764
The proposed use is a bank.

2091
02:46:21,144 --> 02:46:22,526
The existing signage is there.

2092
02:46:23,307 --> 02:46:24,288
I don't think it hurts anybody.

2093
02:46:26,570 --> 02:46:30,254
The signage that they look for doesn't seem to be too overly intrusive.

2094
02:46:30,294 --> 02:46:31,696
It doesn't seem to be too obnoxious.

2095
02:46:33,037 --> 02:46:33,698
It's illuminated.

2096
02:46:33,718 --> 02:46:34,739
The illumination is going to shut off.

2097
02:46:34,899 --> 02:47:00,625
there are no moving pieces it's not digital um you know i think that this you know is something that you know makes sense and just in the realm of fairness alone right i mean i don't want to see mr gab lit up like the las vegas strip you know what i mean um signs with movement i think would have created a problem um illuminated signs in the fashion that you've explained it i don't think it's going to create much of a problem um i'm happy to support this this evening um ultimately we know that um this application has been

2098
02:47:07,547 --> 02:47:09,988
I would be happy to support this this evening.

2099
02:47:10,289 --> 02:47:17,693
I ask that the special permit go with the business and not the address, and that we implement a 90-day review.

2100
02:47:18,293 --> 02:47:22,496
And I would offer those in the forms of restrictions and move for approval on the paper.

2101
02:47:22,516 --> 02:47:23,776
Second that motion, Mr. President.

2102
02:47:23,816 --> 02:47:24,997
Yeah, that's a good one.

2103
02:47:25,037 --> 02:47:25,357
Thank you.

2104
02:47:25,637 --> 02:47:26,778
It is not a special permit.

2105
02:47:26,858 --> 02:47:28,679
It's a petition for sign-of-hour reversal.

2106
02:47:28,759 --> 02:47:29,279
Oh, that's right.

2107
02:47:36,862 --> 02:47:37,422
Oh, sure, good night.

2108
02:47:38,022 --> 02:47:38,182
No.

2109
02:47:38,222 --> 02:47:42,844
We can still put the restrictions on it.

2110
02:47:42,924 --> 02:47:44,964
I just want to make sure the language is right.

2111
02:47:45,764 --> 02:47:51,286
So motion that the 90 day review and that the sign, you know, sign with the business.

2112
02:47:52,006 --> 02:47:52,506
Second.

2113
02:47:53,807 --> 02:47:54,527
Councillor Collins.

2114
02:47:55,907 --> 02:47:56,167
Okay.

2115
02:47:56,327 --> 02:48:02,589
On the motion of Councillor Nights, seconded by Councillor Carviello, as amended by Councillor Nights with restrictions.

2116
02:48:04,973 --> 02:48:08,382
This is a motion to approve the petition for signs now reversal.

2117
02:48:09,866 --> 02:48:11,551
Got a lot of affirmatives and negatives.

2118
02:48:40,740 --> 02:48:45,603
Okay, on the petition to approve the reversal of the signed denial with conditions slash restrictions.

2119
02:48:46,963 --> 02:48:47,704
Councilor Kerrio?

2120
02:48:49,165 --> 02:48:49,785
Councilor Collins?

2121
02:48:50,005 --> 02:48:50,185
Yes.

2122
02:48:50,625 --> 02:48:51,086
Councilor Knight?

2123
02:48:51,146 --> 02:48:51,446
Yes.

2124
02:48:52,066 --> 02:48:52,707
Councilor Scarpelli?

2125
02:48:52,727 --> 02:48:52,947
Yes.

2126
02:48:53,447 --> 02:48:54,047
Councilor Sang?

2127
02:48:54,087 --> 02:48:54,287
Yes.

2128
02:48:55,028 --> 02:48:55,968
President Morrell is absent.

2129
02:48:57,129 --> 02:48:57,829
Vice President Fares?

2130
02:48:57,869 --> 02:48:59,751
Yes, 16 affirmative, one absent.

2131
02:49:00,091 --> 02:49:04,013
The petition for signed denial reversal is accepted.

2132
02:49:05,073 --> 02:49:05,834
Thank you very much.

2133
02:49:07,495 --> 02:49:07,875
Thank you.

2134
02:49:07,975 --> 02:49:09,176
Thanks for sticking around.

2135
02:49:16,484 --> 02:49:19,185
Motion for any motions on the floor.

2136
02:49:20,025 --> 02:49:21,486
Revert back to regular order.

2137
02:49:21,926 --> 02:49:26,107
Motion by Councilor Collins to revert back to the regular order of business, seconded by Councilor Sang.

2138
02:49:26,127 --> 02:49:26,967
All those in favor?

2139
02:49:26,987 --> 02:49:27,107
Aye.

2140
02:49:27,927 --> 02:49:28,307
Opposed?

2141
02:49:28,367 --> 02:49:29,167
Motion passes.

2142
02:49:30,108 --> 02:49:31,788
Back to me.

2143
02:49:31,808 --> 02:49:33,008
22-534, offered by Vice President Behrs.

2144
02:49:33,048 --> 02:49:39,730
Be it so resolved by the Medford City Council that the Mayor, City Solicitor, and any other legal counsel report back to the City Council in executive session if necessary.

2145
02:49:40,607 --> 02:49:46,129
regarding potential legal action against Reef Technology, Republic Parking Systems, Park Medford for breach of contract.

2146
02:49:47,110 --> 02:50:06,578
Something we did learn in the parking meeting was that the parking director believes or seems to believe that there is a possibility that Park Medford, Reef Republic was in breach of their contract, but was advised by the city administration, the mayor and her legal counsel not to pursue a lawsuit to recoup our losses for that breach of contract.

2147
02:50:07,478 --> 02:50:12,699
I would like to have that explanation given to us in more detail in executive session if necessary.

2148
02:50:14,116 --> 02:50:14,796
Any discussion?

2149
02:50:15,097 --> 02:50:15,837
Councilor Sayre.

2150
02:50:16,597 --> 02:50:19,759
Thank you, Vice President Barrett for putting this on the agenda.

2151
02:50:19,839 --> 02:50:24,601
This is something that we discussed lately in our last meeting with the parking department.

2152
02:50:26,062 --> 02:50:33,846
You know, there's, we heard potentially that there was breach of contract and, you know, I mean, I think you've already explained it.

2153
02:50:34,526 --> 02:50:41,770
I just want to make sure that the city administration really does take this item particularly seriously because

2154
02:50:43,138 --> 02:50:50,464
you know, we as a city can't let things like this go on, you know, unaddressed.

2155
02:50:51,925 --> 02:50:58,210
But you know, we also have other items that we've asked to be explained in executive session that we haven't had come back to us.

2156
02:50:58,970 --> 02:51:04,074
And so I just wanted to mark my disappointment on that and hope that this item is different.

2157
02:51:07,105 --> 02:51:07,405
Thank you.

2158
02:51:07,445 --> 02:51:08,887
I appreciate you putting this forward tonight.

2159
02:51:09,848 --> 02:51:10,809
I'm glad to support it.

2160
02:51:10,989 --> 02:51:19,738
And I think related to this, I want to note that I think on some of our previous meetings, if I seem oddly sympathetic to the parking department, when there's a lot of justifiable...

2161
02:51:20,990 --> 02:51:25,571
I think there's been a lot of, um, angst going around because of you know how how that work is going so far.

2162
02:51:25,991 --> 02:51:37,254
I think a lot of that is lodged in what I heard about the condition that the parking department was left in by reef technology at the outset of director Morrison's tenure in the city of Medford.

2163
02:51:37,834 --> 02:51:40,135
Um from various people within that department.

2164
02:51:40,795 --> 02:51:42,615
I have really very grave

2165
02:51:51,400 --> 02:51:59,110
revenue that was who knows how amount and who knows how much of that actually ended up in the city of Medford protocols that seemed

2166
02:52:00,415 --> 02:52:03,197
Um, just just deeply, deeply far from best practice.

2167
02:52:03,217 --> 02:52:10,042
And that, you know, does trace back to our city's mount on a blind, both in terms of what we were being compensated when brief was doing this work.

2168
02:52:10,162 --> 02:52:18,668
If it was fair, if we even have a yardstick for how close to fair it was, um, and how that contributed to the high mountain that we now have to climb to get to a good place with parking.

2169
02:52:19,168 --> 02:52:21,370
Um, so I'm very interested in seeing this investigated.

2170
02:52:21,470 --> 02:52:21,710
Thank you.

2171
02:52:22,317 --> 02:52:26,319
Thank you, Mr. President.

2172
02:52:26,879 --> 02:52:29,240
I do support the intent of this.

2173
02:52:31,320 --> 02:52:35,362
Where we don't have any hosts in, we don't have our own council.

2174
02:52:36,722 --> 02:52:39,784
I hate to be throwing more good money after bad.

2175
02:52:41,104 --> 02:52:43,385
And I agree with you.

2176
02:52:44,105 --> 02:52:45,306
It warrants a conversation.

2177
02:52:45,886 --> 02:52:48,927
See if there is a breach, but if, you know,

2178
02:52:50,639 --> 02:52:57,603
If KP Law is going to charge us $100,000 to collect $50,000, I don't want to do it.

2179
02:52:57,663 --> 02:52:58,583
I hear you.

2180
02:52:58,883 --> 02:53:06,487
I hate to be wasting more money on something that's in the past.

2181
02:53:06,507 --> 02:53:07,428
They did whatever they did.

2182
02:53:08,508 --> 02:53:14,871
I don't know if they did a breach of contract, but before this goes any further, I would just

2183
02:53:16,674 --> 02:53:25,415
I want to see some kind of indication that there is some kind of breach of contract or anything because I just don't want to spend another $100,000 chasing something we're not going to get.

2184
02:53:26,016 --> 02:53:26,536
And I hear you.

2185
02:53:26,676 --> 02:53:28,756
I mean, that's what I'm concerned about.

2186
02:53:28,996 --> 02:53:36,337
Director Morrison said at a minimum $150,000 was her estimate of the minimum of what damages they left us with.

2187
02:53:37,097 --> 02:53:44,559
She went to apparently and I think she said it in the meeting to the mayor and KP law or to the chief of staff and KP law and said, I think we should go after them because $150,000 is not nothing.

2188
02:53:46,371 --> 02:53:51,034
And then KP Law said, I believe the direct quote from Director Morrison was, it's not worth it.

2189
02:53:51,695 --> 02:53:52,475
Not worth it to who?

2190
02:53:53,216 --> 02:53:56,038
And that represents the fundamental conflict of KP Law.

2191
02:53:56,198 --> 02:54:01,301
It may not be worth it at KP Law rates, but it's worth it to the city if we have a city solicitor.

2192
02:54:01,742 --> 02:54:03,183
And that's part of what I'm getting at here.

2193
02:54:03,203 --> 02:54:13,410
If we're saying it's not worth it, but that determination is being made because an outside lawyer is charging the city more than we would, you know, then that's not in the interest of the city.

2194
02:54:13,450 --> 02:54:14,291
That's in the interest of,

2195
02:54:15,051 --> 02:54:19,276
the bill for KP law and that means that we're not getting the legal representation that we need.

2196
02:54:19,296 --> 02:54:21,097
KP law is famous for padding the bill.

2197
02:54:21,578 --> 02:54:23,260
That's their memo with other communities.

2198
02:54:23,700 --> 02:54:25,382
I'm just saying, that's what my concern is.

2199
02:54:25,402 --> 02:54:37,495
Uh, you know, if we had an in-house legal counsel could probably give you a pretty simple answer, but you know, to have them go out and charge us $500, $1,000 an hour to come back and say, you're not going to get anything.

2200
02:54:38,782 --> 02:54:46,445
I just I just don't want to throw away that the city is throwing away hundreds of thousands of dollars only on poor legal advice.

2201
02:54:47,226 --> 02:54:52,148
I would be happy to amend it to say that the mayor and city solicitor when hired.

2202
02:54:53,068 --> 02:54:53,748
Yeah, fine.

2203
02:54:53,808 --> 02:54:56,630
I just don't want to give people already more money.

2204
02:54:58,310 --> 02:54:58,450
Yeah.

2205
02:55:05,222 --> 02:55:11,985
Does anybody ever notice that anytime anything goes wrong in the parking department, it's always somebody else's fault and not the parking department's?

2206
02:55:15,106 --> 02:55:16,366
Or is it just me picking that up?

2207
02:55:20,268 --> 02:55:25,010
When the person who's supposed to be responsible won't take responsibility, what do you, you know?

2208
02:55:27,090 --> 02:55:34,033
And I'm just saying, the person who decided to do this this fast and then brought someone on it to give them the resources to do it,

2209
02:55:35,235 --> 02:55:39,296
is the mayor, and then she puts them out here to take the heat for the decisions that the mayor made.

2210
02:55:40,737 --> 02:55:42,878
And now I'm editorializing from the chair, which I will stop doing.

2211
02:55:46,759 --> 02:55:48,820
On the motion on, is there a motion?

2212
02:55:50,180 --> 02:55:54,121
Motion to approve as amended by Councilor Seconded by Councilor Carviello.

2213
02:55:54,822 --> 02:55:55,982
And here's the amendment if you need it.

2214
02:55:58,763 --> 02:55:59,403
All those in favor?

2215
02:55:59,763 --> 02:55:59,843
Aye.

2216
02:56:00,203 --> 02:56:00,624
Opposed?

2217
02:56:00,724 --> 02:56:01,624
Motion passes.

2218
02:56:02,964 --> 02:56:03,525
I'll give it to him.

2219
02:56:03,545 --> 02:56:04,765
All right.

2220
02:56:05,366 --> 02:56:08,228
22-535 offered by Councilor Collins and Councilor Seng.

2221
02:56:09,129 --> 02:56:09,729
Councilor Collins.

2222
02:56:10,030 --> 02:56:11,190
I'm going to withdraw this motion.

2223
02:56:11,250 --> 02:56:13,072
I think we better take it up closer to election day.

2224
02:56:13,492 --> 02:56:14,093
Withdrawn.

2225
02:56:14,113 --> 02:56:17,015
22-536 offered by Councilor Seng.

2226
02:56:17,035 --> 02:56:25,601
Be it so resolved that the City Council asks the City Administration to reach out to residents about the Affordable Connectivity Program, which provides eligible households $30 per month off their internet bills.

2227
02:56:25,661 --> 02:56:32,486
ACP eligible households can also receive a one-time discount of up to $100 to purchase a laptop, desktop, computer, or tablet from participating providers.

2228
02:56:32,566 --> 02:56:33,207
Councilor Seng.

2229
02:56:34,586 --> 02:56:35,927
Thank you, Vice President Behrs.

2230
02:56:36,568 --> 02:56:47,014
The Affordable Connectivity Program is something that was passed in the bipartisan infrastructure law, which could really help families in our community.

2231
02:56:47,875 --> 02:57:01,543
The $30 per month off internet bills and $100 discount is something that means a lot to families, especially when electricity prices going up and there's inflation when it comes to everyday bills.

2232
02:57:03,324 --> 02:57:15,452
The discount to purchase a laptop, computer, or tablet is also something that could help students who are more disadvantaged in our school system, help people find jobs, help people at work.

2233
02:57:16,513 --> 02:57:22,917
And so I think this is a particularly valuable thing that our city should be reaching out to residents about, making sure that they qualify.

2234
02:57:22,997 --> 02:57:25,438
And there's a whole list of people who qualify.

2235
02:57:26,399 --> 02:57:27,159
One of the

2236
02:57:29,000 --> 02:57:37,745
categories I can pull up out of my mind right now is if you're if you're receiving staff benefits but I think you know this

2237
02:57:39,083 --> 02:57:46,087
Resolution also goes to show that we need a better outreach and better communications policy from the city government.

2238
02:57:46,827 --> 02:57:54,251
And this is one of those situations where it'd be great to have a communications department.

2239
02:57:55,492 --> 02:58:06,338
But perhaps in the meantime, we could have our community liaisons and Office of Outreach and Prevention take the lead as well as some other relevant city departments.

2240
02:58:06,818 --> 02:58:12,641
Thank you, Councillor say any further comments point information kind of concepts, if you can explain this a little bit more detailed at that.

2241
02:58:13,102 --> 02:58:13,722
So this would be.

2242
02:58:13,742 --> 02:58:19,885
This would be $30 household per month for internet and bills.

2243
02:58:20,666 --> 02:58:25,028
Yeah, this is coming through what what program is that it's a federal program.

2244
02:58:25,469 --> 02:58:26,769
What is it, it's a federal program.

2245
02:58:26,789 --> 02:58:27,229
Okay, okay.

2246
02:58:28,676 --> 02:58:29,937
That's amazing, I didn't realize that.

2247
02:58:29,997 --> 02:58:34,378
So that's... Yeah, I didn't know about it until I came across it on Twitter one day.

2248
02:58:34,579 --> 02:58:38,760
And if you're not on Twitter, you might not find out.

2249
02:58:38,920 --> 02:58:43,943
This should be something that, again, this is where you should be standing on top of mountains.

2250
02:58:44,383 --> 02:58:54,087
Imagine parents understanding the difficulties they're having with Wi-Fi connections, because affordability, there's a process that we can do that on the federal side.

2251
02:58:55,423 --> 02:59:02,426
It's disheartening but appreciate your hard work and finding that that's a, I would second your resolution.

2252
02:59:02,746 --> 02:59:05,507
And the motion of Councilor Sang, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

2253
02:59:06,068 --> 02:59:06,888
All those in favor?

2254
02:59:07,028 --> 02:59:07,408
Aye.

2255
02:59:07,868 --> 02:59:08,349
Opposed?

2256
02:59:08,469 --> 02:59:09,269
Motion passes.

2257
02:59:09,329 --> 02:59:10,510
I will not support the next one.

2258
02:59:11,170 --> 02:59:11,330
No?

2259
02:59:11,750 --> 02:59:12,811
Well, if we challenge it.

2260
02:59:13,831 --> 02:59:17,453
This protects you from discrimination.

2261
02:59:17,553 --> 02:59:20,914
I will not support anything that has to do with it.

2262
02:59:23,720 --> 02:59:49,116
22-537 offered by councilor saying whereas chapter 117 of the acts of 2022 entitled quote an act prohibiting discrimination based upon natural and protective hairstyles also referred to as the crown act which takes effect on october 24th 2022 prohibits discrimination against individuals in workplaces school associations and places of public accommodation based on quote traits that historically associated with race be it so resolved that the city council asked the city administration

2263
02:59:50,098 --> 03:00:00,046
to review their equal employment opportunity and or anti discrimination policies as well as any other policies or codes that may limit or interfere with an employee's ability to wear natural and protective hairstyles update the council on review.

2264
03:00:00,066 --> 03:00:04,089
Thank you vice president bears for reading all that.

2265
03:00:04,749 --> 03:00:10,814
Um, this is a law that was passed by our state legislature and that's now law in our state.

2266
03:00:12,619 --> 03:00:16,202
And it's going into effect pretty soon in about two weeks.

2267
03:00:16,822 --> 03:00:25,449
Um, we need to make sure that we as a city are not in breach of this, um, you know, to save us legal trouble but also to make sure that everything is fair in our city.

2268
03:00:27,567 --> 03:00:38,175
Again, this goes to show we need a city solicitor solicitor we need an assistant city solicitor we need people who can review our policies and make sure that that state law, we're not interfering with state law.

2269
03:00:38,796 --> 03:00:45,081
And, yeah, and I would appreciate if the city administration will send us a report about and keep us updated about what's happening.

2270
03:00:45,461 --> 03:00:46,562
Mr President, I can.

2271
03:00:49,808 --> 03:01:05,371
my colleague bringing this forward, I think that this, I believe, was a huge issue in the local school department that then left that school department in financial resolve because of that situation.

2272
03:01:05,411 --> 03:01:16,633
So it's good to see if we bring that forward, making sure that our school superintendent and school department and the governing body there that makes decisions also are informed of

2273
03:01:18,903 --> 03:01:23,928
this, this very important situation because we don't want to be viable.

2274
03:01:24,108 --> 03:01:24,869
So, thank you.

2275
03:01:25,189 --> 03:01:26,390
And we said I would second that.

2276
03:01:27,031 --> 03:01:28,453
Seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

2277
03:01:28,653 --> 03:01:32,016
One of the main reasons this law passed was due to the actions of Mystic Valley Regional.

2278
03:01:32,597 --> 03:01:36,440
And we send millions of dollars over there right over to Mystic Valley Regional.

2279
03:01:36,460 --> 03:01:37,061
Yep, that's it.

2280
03:01:37,341 --> 03:01:37,842
Charter School.

2281
03:01:40,126 --> 03:01:43,047

2282
03:01:43,527 --> 03:01:44,647

2283
03:01:45,167 --> 03:01:46,128
Motion passes.

2284
03:01:48,148 --> 03:01:52,969
Sorry, any further items I missed anything.

2285
03:01:52,989 --> 03:01:54,650
Jump around so much and it's like so long.

2286
03:01:54,670 --> 03:01:55,650
Motion to adjourn please.

2287
03:01:56,710 --> 03:02:02,532
