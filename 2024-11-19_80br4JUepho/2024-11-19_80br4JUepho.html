    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=152.346s">Councilor</a>  Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=153.386s">Motion</a>  to take paper 2245, 452 out of, 542, sorry, out of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=160.348s">We</a>  have a few people in the audience here to speak on the paper.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=171.866s">That's</a>  what I'm seeking?</p>

    <p>[Elections Manager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=212.132s">Hi,</a>  I'm Melissa Ripley. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=213.273s">I</a>  live at 27 being terrorist in Melrose. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=216.661s">Thank</a>  you for having me, letting me come in here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=219.383s">Very</a>  excited to be here as the elections manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=222.526s">Today</a>  before you, I would like to ask you to approve the warrant for the 2020 state election, which is November 8th. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=229.131s">The</a>  elect, the paperwork in your packet shows the words and precincts that are available for the voters this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=235.296s">It</a>  also gives a synopsis of all the things that will be on the ballot.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=243.169s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=246.451s">Just</a>  to confirm a couple of things, I think most folks by now are familiar that there's going to be four ballot questions statewide, which we'll be considering, but I also noticed that there were two ballot questions here that are non-binding that are local ballot questions, questions five and six. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=264.259s">I</a>  just wanted to confirm that questions five and six will be on the ballot in <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=270.09s">Uh,</a>  are they in every district or they're not in every district? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=272.951s">Could</a>  you tell us?</p>

    <p>[Elections Manager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=273.532s">They're</a>  only in two districts.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=275.033s">Could</a>  you say which ones there?</p>

    <p>[Elections Manager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=276.413s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=276.853s">Let</a>  me just pull it open here so I can show you. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=279.295s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=284.597s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=284.937s">Question</a>  five. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=285.858s">This</a>  question is not binding. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=287.839s">It</a>  is in Ward one precinct one and two Ward two precinct one and two Ward three precinct one and two. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=296.956s">Ward</a>  4, Precinct 1, and Precinct 2.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=299.318s">Is</a>  this just the State Reps District? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=301.419s">Which</a>  one? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=302.7s">The</a>  34th? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=303.28s">This</a>  looks like all of them.</p>

    <p>[Elections Manager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=305.662s">So</a>  number 5 is all. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=307.183s">Number</a>  6 is limited to the wards and precincts. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=311.165s">So</a>  as you can see, the different wards and precincts are a little different.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=315.768s">So</a>  that would be in the Barber District and the Donato District?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=320.471s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=321.392s">OK,</a>  so question 6 is just not on the ballot in the Garbally District.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=324.763s">correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=325.263s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=326.104s">And</a>  then could you just let if you have it available, let folks know when early voting is going to be available and where it will be available.</p>

    <p>[Elections Manager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=333.89s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=334.15s">We're</a>  still working on the early voting, but the early voting is required by the state to be October 2nd through November 4th. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=340.735s">It</a>  is likely the early voting will be here on the weekends. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=343.898s">We</a>  are required to do six hours each weekend day for early voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=347.781s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=348.385s">probably</a>  8 32 30 on both Saturdays and Sundays. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=352.25s">The</a>  last day to register to vote will be October 29th. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=356.255s">The</a>  office will be open until five o'clock for people to register to vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=359.579s">However,</a>  early voting will only be 8 32 30 that day. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=363.538s">During</a>  the week, early voting is available during regular business hours of City Hall.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=368.043s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=368.444s">And</a>  then my last question is on mail balloting. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=370.987s">I</a>  know it's a little different for the general versus the primary. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=373.911s">So</a>  for the general, if I'm correct, and correct me if I'm wrong, ballots will be accepted as long as they're postmarked by Election Day.</p>

    <p>[Elections Manager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=381.86s">Yes,</a>  they will be as they will be accepted as long as they're postmarked by Election Day, and they need to be here within a certain time timeframe after the election, so we can allow for counting.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=392.392s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=393.973s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Elections Manager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=394.854s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=396.636s">Second,</a>  Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Elections Manager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=397.197s">That's</a>  what I was just saying.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=399.139s">Just</a>  to clarify, by Election Day, does that include Election Day for the viewers who are watching?</p>

    <p>[Elections Manager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=403.957s">Yes,</a>  so it needs to be postmarked by the election day. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=408.458s">And</a>  if it's not a mail-in ballot, it needs to be here by 8 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=412.819s">Otherwise,</a>  we have a couple of days after, so we can count those ballots and receive them.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=416.979s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=417.599s">Thank</a>  you for the discussion from councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=421.28s">On</a>  that motion to approve from Councilor Knight, I second it by vicers and bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=426.521s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=427.701s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=428.381s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=429.201s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=430.182s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=431.422s">Thank</a>  you both.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=433.384s">Senate</a>  President motion to revert to the regular order of business.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=435.925s">On</a>  the motion of Vice President Bears to revert to the regular order of business as seconded by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=440.427s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=441.448s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=441.668s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=444.589s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=445.51s">22-521</a>  offered by Vice President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=447.271s">Be</a>  it resolved by the Medford City Council that we celebrate Italian Heritage Month this October and recognize the massive contributions Italian and Italian American people have made to Medford, our country and the world, as well as the rich cultural diversity, history, and vibrancy our city owes to the Italian American community.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=464.696s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=465.817s">I</a>  think the resolution is relatively self-explanatory, but this is Italian Heritage Month, and it's obviously a time to celebrate the contributions of Italian and Italian-American people to our city here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=483.893s">As</a>  we know, Medford for a long time has had a vibrant <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=488.197s">Italian</a>  community, a place for immigrants from Italy to come here, and then for many generations to raise families, and we can see the impact in our business community, government, culture, everywhere in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=500.548s">And</a>  I think it's a great time to recognize Italian Heritage Month. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=505.332s">So</a>  I would motion to approve and to join with Councilor Tseng's paper 22-525. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=509.076s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=511.518s">Going</a>  to Councilor Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=513.169s">Thank</a>  you, I would second that motion, first of all. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=517.332s">In</a>  prepping for tonight, I thought of a conversation I had with one of my college mentors, who was a proud Italian American, and he knows Taiwanese culture really well, so my family background. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=528.9s">And</a>  we had a long talk about the values that we share in common, which are family, community, hard work, amongst other values. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=538.286s">And</a>  in Medford, we're extremely fortunate for the rich involvement of Italian Americans in building our city from, as Vice President Bears has stated, from teaching to public safety, work like plumbing and healthcare, public service and beyond. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=554.314s">I</a>  just wanted to say I really appreciate that here in Medford I grew up learning about Italian culture, learning the language, learning about Italian foods, and being able to do my little diorama of Galileo's project, which is something I've come to realize outside of Medford is not such a common experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=574.25s">And</a>  I think Medford's past and present proves that these values, family, community, public service, hard work, they are fundamental to who we are as a city, and that the contributions of this community, of the Italian American community, have really shaped who we are, and that they prove that this is larger than any one person. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=594.894s">It's</a>  really about our community as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=597.834s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=598.354s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=600.294s">Any</a>  further discussion from the Council?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=603.822s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=604.642s">I</a>  do believe, oh, it must be about a year and a half ago now, this council passed a measure and we sent it to the administration and shocker, never got a response. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=612.965s">But</a>  what we asked for was the administration to analyze the feasibility of creating an Italian-American cultural district in South Medford to commemorate the contributions of many of our Italian-American residents here. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=627.909s">When</a>  you think about people like <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=633.1s">Ernesto</a>  Martini, Alfredo Russo, and the likes, people that really made a big difference in this community over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=640.585s">We've</a>  asked the administration to look into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=644.443s">Year</a>  and a half might have gone by now, and we still haven't received anything from it, from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=649.408s">So</a>  I know it's only been a year and a half, and it's usually about three years before we get something back from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=654.793s">But</a>  I'm hoping that maybe we can put a reminder into the administration as maybe a B paper or as an amendment to this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=661.078s">I'm</a>  asking for an update from the administration on the feasibility of creating an Italian American cultural district as passed by the council previously.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=669.547s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=670.207s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=671.208s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=672.349s">President,</a>  I just want to thank my two councillors for putting this on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=676.932s">I'm</a>  very proud to be an Italian member of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=680.435s">Both</a>  of my parents are Italian American, my grandparents are. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=685.278s">And</a>  again, I'm glad we're going to recognize the <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=692.185s">all</a>  the things that Italian Americans have done in this community over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=694.987s">So</a>  I stand with Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=697.188s">I</a>  mean, I think I was a co-sponsor of that with him, to have something to recognize the Italian community, but as we see, nothing ever came of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=707.755s">But</a>  I just want to thank my two councilors for putting it on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=710.737s">Took</a>  a little bit of heat from the public, because the two Italian guys didn't put it on.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=716.52s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=717.481s">Any</a>  further discussion from the council?</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=721.333s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=721.673s">Thank</a>  you for my fellow counsel putting this forward as a first generation American who has a very deep and proud tradition of our Italian culture. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=731.063s">I</a>  appreciate bringing this forward, but I will tell you to say that the Italian American community isn't <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=740.063s">is</a>  still a little unhappy in our community, not because of a name change of a school, but because of the discussions of not following through with really celebrating an Italian American and making sure that our community wasn't forgotten. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=759.446s">It's</a>  something that I appreciate my colleagues bringing this resolution forward so we can mention it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=765.03s">I</a>  appreciate Councilor Knight and Councilor Caraviello for that initiative they did put through a year and a half ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=770.754s">But</a>  again, I guess if it's not forefront in the news, it's really not a true issue in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=777.159s">So</a>  it's disheartening for Councilor Caraviello <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=784.162s">person</a>  like myself that parents came to this country from Italy to make make their their roots to settle their roots and look at follow the American dream. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=795.774s">And</a>  and Medford has done that for sure for my family. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=800.499s">We're</a>  very fortunate that my mom and dad have now passed on but left us. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=807.513s">We</a>  leave them at the thanks of everything they've done for us and how they taught us to work hard and really have pride in who we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=816.716s">And</a>  I think that, I just hope this community and this administration follows through what they're saying and what we talked about just a few short years ago, because it seems like it's a culture that is easily forgotten where one time <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=836.238s">the</a>  Italian culture and the Irish culture in this community built it for what it is today. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=840.302s">Why</a>  so many people love this great city. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=841.984s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=846.495s">Um,</a>  I just, I just wanted to thank Councilor Knight for the bee papers. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=851.976s">Um,</a>  that's that's an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=853.517s">That's</a>  an initiative that I, I would support. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=856.757s">Um,</a>  I actually, about two years ago, I was in San Diego, which has its little, little Italy. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=864.679s">I'm</a>  sure President Morello is familiar. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=869.719s">I</a>  was actually very touched by, they had signs on the roads, on lampposts, talking about different Italian-Americans and their contributions to both San Diego and to the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=883.108s">And</a>  it'd be very nice if we could have something like that here in Medford, celebrating the contributions of Italian-Americans to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=891.434s">Perhaps</a>  something even more local, more Medford-based, since we have such a rich Italian-American history here. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=897.538s">Um,</a>  but again, I support that idea.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=900.0s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng any further discussion from the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=903.963s">Mr.</a>  Yeah, it's a big paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=905.884s">I</a>  just see Mr. Castagnetti is rare to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=908.846s">Name</a>  and address for record, please.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=914.25s">Andrew</a>  Castagnetti, Christian Street Method Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=917.332s">I</a>  want to thank the council for bringing celebrating the Italian Heritage Month. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=924.217s">And</a>  I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=927.156s">In</a>  my opinion, I might be a bit biased, but Italy, the Italian people's probably the greatest contributors to the world worldwide. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=935.52s">And</a>  they'll live in worldwide too. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=938.081s">From</a>  the depression days when they had to get out of the country because they couldn't feed themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=944.584s">A</a>  few examples of their great leaders would be Da Vinci, Michelangelo, Ferdinand, Galileo, Marconi. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=956.069s">It</a>  goes on and on. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=958.2s">Miracle</a>  versus Gucci and we're named after that as the Americas. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=962.463s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=966.065s">And</a>  Italian cuisine, as a matter of fact, where my folks come from, I'm not first generation, I'm half generation. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=973.129s">I</a>  was born in Cambridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=974.93s">I</a>  didn't speak English until I started kindergarten. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=977.272s">I</a>  spoke another Italian dialect, one of thousands with all the mountains from the Alps down to the boot heel. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=987.289s">The</a>  first gastronomical university in all of Europe was in Bologna, Italy, which is near Venice and Milano. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1000.117s">And</a>  to a lot of us, Italo-Americans, the greatest of them all was the most courageous explorer of all time. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1015.875s">Cristoforo</a>  Colombo, who said that the world was not flat, he would not fall off it, and he would get to the other side, but he was blocked by a couple of continents in the central, which became America. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1034.706s">Imagine</a>  the courage on this guy, the stones, saying the world was wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1040.247s">And</a>  unfortunately, the King of Italy did not back him, or else it would have been all Italians in Central America. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1047.609s">So</a>  Queen Isabella gave him the Nina Pinto and Santa Maria, and so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1053.65s">However,</a>  it's most unfortunate, and it saddens a lot of <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1059.149s">we</a>  residents that the Christopher Columbus School was delisted, the name was taken away. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1066.492s">And</a>  mind you, that was done during the so-called Corona 19 pandemic when the world was shut down and we could not even attend the meetings live in person, mind you. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1080.976s">I</a>  would have loved to have that opportunity to say a few syllables. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1087.283s">I</a>  don't know why they took his name down to this day and destroyed statues. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1094.685s">It</a>  makes me ill to think of that, the disrespect. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1099.127s">They're</a>  saying that he's bad, he's a bad man, but no one's shown me any document that he was convicted of any crime and therefore was a felon. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1115.152s">I</a>  don't see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1117.044s">All</a>  I hear is rumors. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1120.405s">I</a>  mean, can all our politicians that were elected, can they truthfully say that they're not felons? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1127.468s">Here,</a>  next door, Austin, Washington, D.C.? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1134.431s">Again,</a>  I thank you, Councilors, for bringing up Italian Heritage Month, but I wish Columbus was back on the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1143.455s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1373.483s">Madam</a>  President, thank you very much and thank you to Councilor Caraviello for putting this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1377.425s">I've</a>  known Barbara DeCristofaro for as long as I can remember growing up in the same neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1382.166s">Friendly</a>  with her father, Jerry, for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1383.807s">He</a>  was a great guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1385.616s">It's</a>  glad it's great to see Barbara pursue this promotional opportunity to be appointed by the administration to position sergeant. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1392.46s">And</a>  I think it's important that you know the brass and our police department is reflective of the population that we serve. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1398.744s">So</a>  with that being said, I'm hoping that I reach out director will take steps to encourage minority and female police officers to take these promotional exams. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1407.029s">for</a>  Barbara to be promoted the first female sergeant in the city of Medford in the year 2022 is kind of showing that our internal recruitment is lacking. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1418.889s">And</a>  we have many talented police officers that are here in this community that would help make the brass in our police department reflective of the population that we have here. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1429.96s">But</a>  we have to encourage those individuals to apply for the civil service exams. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1434.525s">We</a>  need to provide them with the tools necessary to study for the civil service exams so that they'll be in a position <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1449.217s">for</a>  being one of the first.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1655.112s">Any</a>  further discussion from the council?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1658.834s">Madam</a>  President, as part of this paper just like an update from the city administration is Council beers mentioned, we had a $1 million grant project that was funded for the safe routes to school, and that created a bike lane from maybe halfway up the hill on high street to the work school, but part of that project also reconfigured the intersection at Wilbur Street high street. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1677.521s">And</a>  since that time, property, personal residents that have bought <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1686.323s">including</a>  flooding, drainage issues and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1689.606s">We've</a>  seen McKay construction out there at least six times since this project was supposed to be completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1696.911s">So</a>  I'd just like to get an update from the administration as to what the status of the drainage issue is on the corner of Woobin and High Street and how much money the city's expended since the completion of the $1 million grant project and remedying the design defects and on property damage claims since this project's been completed.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1713.066s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1713.786s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1714.786s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1716.047s">Thank</a>  you, Council Member for bringing it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1718.207s">I've</a>  been involved with that project since it started. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1720.908s">If</a>  anyone's driven by, notice it got dug up again for the third time. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1725.289s">Put</a>  back, and then if you talk to the city engineer and the company, they're telling you that they don't think this is going to work anyways. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1734.33s">I</a>  don't even know why they dug it up again, did it? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1736.331s">But</a>  I urge the engineer not to sign off on this until the <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1742.603s">It's</a>  proven that it's going to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1744.205s">And</a>  the other issue is the neighbors be made whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1748.989s">They've</a>  got lawsuits, and they're just pretty much being ignored by either the state or the contractor, which isn't fair to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1756.535s">They're</a>  spending money on legal claims that they shouldn't have had to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1760.399s">And</a>  when you talk to the guys there, they'll tell you that the pump-out comes out too far because it diverts the water into their house instead of away from the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1770.157s">I'd</a>  like to, I know the project is done again. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1772.7s">I</a>  don't know what the final outcome, but I've, I've urged the engineer not to sign off on this until sometime find out if it actually works because they're doubting that it's going to even work.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1789.503s">I</a>  do just want to add, I want to thank Councilor Collins for bringing this forward as someone who bike commutes to work whenever I can, I mean it's it's terrifying as an adult to ride on the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1798.386s">It</a>  doesn't have to be that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1799.807s">So</a>  I think programs like this, I mean infrastructure is really what we need, but programs like this go a long way, especially just announcing at a council meeting letting people to know, you know, pay extra attention to Martin's going to be a lot of kids, a lot of families on the roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1813.04s">doing</a>  what they have every right to do, taking their bikes, walking, rolling, whatever they can do to get to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1818.121s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Collins, as seconded by vice chairs and bears, all those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1822.243s">Oh,</a>  sorry, as amended by Councilor Knight, seconded by vice chair and bears, all those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1828.024s">All</a>  those opposed, motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1832.806s">So</a>  22-526 offered by Councilor Tseng, be it so resolved that the city council recognize October as domestic abuse awareness month, Councilor Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1841.397s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1843.298s">October</a>  is Domestic Abuse Awareness Month. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1846.419s">Domestic</a>  abuse is a issue that unfortunately touches a lot of residents in the city, in the state, around the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1856.584s">And</a>  I think it's important for us to be able to speak more openly about it as a society and to talk about the effects of domestic abuse, to talk about trauma, and to talk about mental health. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1869.47s">Um,</a>  I was fortunate enough to be, um, at a, um, event with the Metro Police Department and Portal to Hope with Councilor Caraviello, where we learned a lot about how, um, trauma, we can use trauma to inform the work that we do in the workplace and as elected officials in our policies, which, um, really starts by listening and understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1893.8s">this</a>  is, of course, a very serious issue, and I am grateful for the opportunity to be able to bring some light to it on the council.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2160.473s">Can</a>  you just explain what the significance of October 26th is?</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2164.476s">I</a>  believe as October 26th being the date that he flew the plane, landing onto the, <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2169.521s">the</a>  first American landing onto a moving aircraft carrier. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2172.022s">I</a>  think there's a number of dates we could choose from, and that was the date requested by the friend of the Toralea.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2242.617s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2243.838s">It's</a>  come to my attention that residents on Sydney Street are facing some difficulties with the facility Budweiser facility, both temporary and permanent. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2254.563s">There's</a>  some temporary changes that have moved a lot of idling trucks and things right into people's basically right across the fence from their backyard. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2261.567s">You</a>  got folks looking, you know, whether intentionally or unintentionally, you know, you're looking right into people's houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2266.409s">There's</a>  a lot of noise, a lot of, <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2268.76s">you</a>  know, just negative impacts on the residents of Sydney Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2271.882s">And</a>  then also some long-term mitigation would be welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2274.903s">Basically</a>  all that the facility has said that they would do is they'll put up a, you know, kind of something on the fence, a solid barrier, which really isn't enough to mitigate the noise and, you know, other impacts of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2287.19s">So</a>  I do know that we have some residents here who are interested in speaking on it, and hopefully we can communicate with the facility to get a little bit more support for those residents.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2298.105s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2298.966s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2300.526s">Hello,</a>  my name's Nadia Puriforia. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2302.228s">I</a>  live at 42 Sydney Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2304.229s">Good</a>  evening, City Council, and thank you, Zach Bears, for the invite. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2308.111s">So</a>  I've lived there since 2005, and basically, it's right behind my house, and there's not been many issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2314.615s">We've</a>  just dealt with light noises through the years, and they've been pretty good neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2319.538s">But</a>  just as of this past summer, we have a pool right in the backyard, and they are apparently working in the parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2326.382s">but</a>  they move their trucks like literally behind our backyard and I have five young girls I have a swimming pool and there's men out there at their lunch breaks and they're parked like along the fence and now since they're doing work in the parking lot they put their actual trucks like right along our fence and it's day and night you get the trucks unloading it's a loud bang it could be two in the morning <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2346.608s">Um,</a>  in the back of the trucks, you can see cases of beer that's just right there visible. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2350.99s">Like</a>  it's just, uh, beyond being, um, an ugly eyesore. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2354.912s">It's</a>  the noise, the lights go right into my girl's bedroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2358.494s">And</a>  last summer they, um, I did speak with the mayor and she called them because originally there was a lot of trees, but the trees were dead. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2365.057s">So</a>  they cut them down. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2366.673s">And</a>  they said they'll put this like cloth sheet up and it basically lasted a couple months fell down. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2372.36s">And</a>  I did speak with the mayor again over the summer and she said she would contact them and they put up a little cloth sheet. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2378.266s">It's</a>  just literally behind my house and it doesn't do anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2381.33s">There's</a>  still people coming out for lunch breaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2383.732s">It</a>  doesn't do anything with the noise and also the pollution, the trucks are like literally running nonstop. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2390.015s">So</a>  I was hoping for the house next to mine has like pine trees behind her house and you really can't see the trucks, you can't see the light, it helps with the noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2399.039s">I</a>  did bring pictures along if anyone wants to see them, but we're hoping either for a wall or something more permanent, because this really isn't helping things. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2410.444s">And</a>  it's once again, like I said, the privacy, the noise, <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2414.085s">Um,</a>  I'm just, I don't know who's in that parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2416.611s">So,</a>  and I have seven children, so there's a lot of, um, my friend, their friends coming over and stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2421.622s">So</a>  I was just hoping for something to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2425.157s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2426.398s">I</a>  don't know if I leave these.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2427.398s">Yeah,</a>  we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2428.299s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2428.499s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2429.44s">Do</a>  you want to come to Carlyle?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2432.502s">Our</a>  city messenger is out tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2434.062s">So</a>  he would normally grab it.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2435.683s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2436.424s">Madam</a>  President, the city clerk be so kind as to investigate report back to the council as to whether or not BJ says any special permits extended our permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2444.669s">So</a>  like, I think one way that we may be able to address this is by bringing them in and saying this is an issue that's going on in the community and you have a permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2455.385s">and</a>  we don't like what you're doing, so we're gonna take a look at your permit and see if we can put some restrictions on it to safeguard the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2461.187s">This</a>  has been an ongoing issue since I got on the council, between Budweiser and BJ's, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2466.809s">Tough</a>  neighbors, you know, large employers in this community, valuable neighbors, you know, bring some good to the community, no doubt. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2473.791s">But</a>  you have to live there, I don't, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2475.131s">And</a>  you know, I know where you live, I know where your house is. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2478.012s">It's</a>  not a little tiny little street, you know what I mean?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2480.253s">It's</a>  not exactly- It used to be a once peaceful, now I just, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2486.073s">I</a>  don't even wanna go in my backyard anymore.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2489.145s">Well,</a>  when it's warm, if you don't wanna go and use your pool, I will. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2494.669s">And</a>  I don't care about those crummy old men over there with their beer. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2497.831s">I'll</a>  watch them and they watch me. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2503.635s">No,</a>  I think that the best bet would be to see if we can call the brass in for BJ. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2507.377s">We've</a>  tried this before. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2508.858s">I</a>  mean, ultimately, I don't think it's gonna help situations that we are right now in the middle of litigation with BJs because we didn't want them to put a gas station in. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2517.418s">So</a>  there's a lot of moving parts going on with that location, but I think that the special permit might be the best way to attack it.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2528.75s">Thank</a>  you, and thank you, Mr. Pierre, for coming out and let us know. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2533.074s">Again,</a>  my recommendation, if we can have our code enforcement officer there on a daily basis, because money talks. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2541.701s">So</a>  every time we see a violation, we should be taking these violations. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2546.365s">And</a>  if it happens three, four times a day, then they should be taken three, four times a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2551.71s">Like</a>  Councilor Knight said, it's getting frustrating for us <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2555.833s">that</a>  when you talk, try to have a conversation or work together with these bigger companies, falls on deaf ears and it's frustrating. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2565.756s">So</a>  I think if we can make a recommendation that we ask a code enforcement officer to make, you know, two trips a day and, you know, really have a pipeline that <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2579.5s">Mr.</a>  Purifori can call them directly, and when you see and hear a violation, that we call them right away and they come right over. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2587.245s">I've</a>  had issues with something as simple as a construction project going on in Fulton Street that we had neighbors, trucks were parking on the sidewalk, kids were trying to walk to school, so we set it up that <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2600.435s">The</a>  constituents that saw something, they called me, I called the code enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2604.157s">After</a>  the fourth ticket, there hasn't been a truck parked on Fulton Street on the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2609.28s">So</a>  I think that if this is how you have to do it, this is how we have to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2615.264s">It's</a>  frustrating, but it's the only way that I see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2618.966s">We've</a>  asked him to come in to talk to him, his partners. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2623.21s">And</a>  between BJ's and Budweiser, there really hasn't been much of a partnership. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2628.191s">So</a>  if we can do that, that'd be something that I would recommend. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2631.252s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2632.252s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2633.233s">I</a>  think to that point, it's more than five minutes of idling is, you know, it's against state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2637.694s">So</a>  it's not even Medford, it's state.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2639.674s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2641.154s">I</a>  was going to bring that up, but under federal law, anything more than five minutes is a violation of the admissions there. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2649.336s">Were</a>  you there when we had that walkthrough? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2652.478s">Like,</a>  like before five years ago we did, we had agreed to hold me right on the property there. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2656.824s">We</a>  walked through and I know a little bit of something got done I know it wasn't done to the satisfaction that we right but I'm Scott was right. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2666.235s">I</a>  think we need to find out. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2669.579s">what</a>  laws they're violating, and yeah, cite it in the park book, and that seems to be the only language they recognize. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2677.501s">And</a>  if we need to have another committee of the whole meeting down there in person, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2682.203s">Just</a>  to let them know that we are serious about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2684.784s">And</a>  it's not fair that they park all those trucks there all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2689.045s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2694.04s">how</a>  it's the trucks, but they said it's because- Are they doing what, working the parking lot out there? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2697.323s">Supposedly,</a>  and they said the trucks will go back to the original area and their cars will come back, but I'm still concerned because they're out there in their lunch breaks and they put their chairs against our fence and it just- Yeah, so that's not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2709.254s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2710.567s">Yeah,</a>  I think they're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2712.108s">I</a>  think the only way to hit them is in the park book. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2714.189s">And</a>  I say we have the court of course, McDonald, go down there and let them know about what's going on down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2724.115s">Even</a>  the violation of the federal admission standards.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2727.197s">Yeah,</a>  those are definitely running through the night. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2730.739s">Five</a>  minutes is five minutes is definitely longer than five minutes.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2734.741s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2735.621s">Vice</a>  Chair Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2737.045s">Thank</a>  you to my fellow councillors. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2739.187s">I</a>  think we have a lot of great options. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2743.187s">I</a>  think we'll reach out to them and see if we can get something. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2746.688s">If</a>  they respond to us at any sort of time, maybe we can get some mitigation done right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2751.05s">Excuse</a>  me. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2752.031s">And</a>  if not, we'll look at, things are just falling from the sky today. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2755.832s">We'll</a>  look at the special permit and the fines. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2758.133s">And</a>  I think Councilor Morell and Councilor Carpio's point about idling is a major point as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2763.255s">So</a>  we'll see what we can do.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2764.416s">And</a>  then do I just appear by email or?</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2767.497s">I'll</a>  keep you in the loop on anything that we hear back.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2778.79s">I</a>  think it is important to point out, though, that this is really a function of the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2783.935s">I</a>  remember when Mike McGlynn was the mayor, he'd get in his car and drive down there and say, I want to meet with the general manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2788.278s">He</a>  wouldn't pick up the phone and call him. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2789.639s">He'd</a>  say, this is what I want done, and go down there to meet with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2791.941s">If</a>  you're not getting that type of service, you're not getting that type of service, and we'll do all that we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2795.585s">But</a>  ultimately, this is an enforcement issue, not a legislative issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2799.848s">So</a>  the administration has to buy into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2802.13s">And</a>  if the administration wants to see it stop, then they have to send their people down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2805.833s">They</a>  have to send code enforcement down there and they have to hold VJs accountable. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2809.215s">This</a>  council can't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2810.516s">We</a>  can call them to the meetings and we can try to work on the permits that fall under our purview. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2815.098s">But</a>  when it comes to the day-to-day operations of the community and code enforcement, that's a department that falls under the building commissioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2820.841s">for</a>  an administrative branch and executive branch department, the mayor has to get them down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2826.425s">And</a>  we can ask until we're blue in the face. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2827.966s">But</a>  if a track record of asking is any indication as to what the administration is going to do, this is going to go on a file like this big right here.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2834.251s">And</a>  we're not going to we're not going to hear back because that's historically what's happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2837.894s">We've</a>  talked <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2838.294s">about</a>  it all day today in our previous meetings as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2841.597s">We</a>  had a subcommittee meeting today to talk about two pieces of draft ordinances that we've asked for. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2847.123s">The</a>  first one was offered in 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2848.985s">It</a>  was a two-sentence draft ordinance that needed review. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2852.369s">The</a>  administration didn't get back to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2853.61s">us.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2854.09s">The</a>  second item was offered in 2020 was a little bit more involved but again the administration still hasn't responded to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2859.791s">So</a>  these are items that this council is asking for for us to create legislation in this community, and we're not getting any, any cooperation. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2868.473s">So</a>  my advice to you would be also to be sure to stay on the administration and let them know your level of dissatisfaction, because they're really the only ones that can solve this <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2882.363s">We're</a>  ready to fight with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2883.344s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2883.764s">I</a>  appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2884.684s">And</a>  use as much authority and power that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2887.126s">However,</a>  that scope and authority is limited under the purview of our responsibilities.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2890.988s">Because</a>  we want to stay in our homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2892.889s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2893.129s">Exactly.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2893.709s">Exactly.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2895.01s">It's</a>  a great quiet street.</p>

    <p>[KttEmL8hj40_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2960.133s">Okay,</a>  well, I just want to say, first of all, thank you to Councilman Caraviello for addressing the issue as promptly as he did, and the rest of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2970.096s">I</a>  was really quite upset to go out on a Saturday morning and see that I had parking meter pole in front of my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2980.178s">I</a>  don't think that they belong in front of private residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2983.439s">I</a>  don't think that they belong in front of a church or a school. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2986.946s">for</a>  me personally, if the meter is there and I have to park in front of my house, I have to run out all day long and feed a meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2995.148s">If</a>  my family members want to visit me, they're going to have to do the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2999.69s">So</a>  I was really upset that the city would do something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3005.111s">And</a>  I'm just hoping that, you know, once you all revisit it, that <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3011.246s">I</a>  won't see a meter in front of my house, but I do want to thank you and for, you know, doing whatever you just did and worked your magic so that the meter was not put in. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3021.513s">So</a>  thank you very much.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3022.754s">Thank</a>  you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3023.135s">Bartholomew.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3024.275s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello then Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3025.476s">I</a>  think, I think someone else wants to speak.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3026.917s">Oh,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3027.878s">On</a>  the same, on the, do you want me to go to the next parking paper or Councilor Knight?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3031.941s">So</a>  Rita, does this mean you're not going to go to the celebration on the completion of the Medford square meter project ice cream truck that the mayor wants to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3045.323s">I</a>  agree with you, and I know Councilor Carvialo and I had spoke on this, and Ricky was telling me how involved he was in working with Faye and the administration to get those taken out. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3056.446s">It</a>  seems like the left hand doesn't know what the right is doing a lot of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3061.888s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3062.568s">There's</a>  someone else on that paper, Councilor Carvialo?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3064.049s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3066.49s">Mr.</a>  Bartolomeo called me on Saturday, and in all honesty, I didn't notice the polls were up. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3072.071s">She</a>  called me and told me, I went by her house and looked, <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3075.165s">kind</a>  of astounded that they went down as far as they did, uh, blocking school. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3079.546s">And</a>  I was even more shocked when I saw it was going to be four in front of St. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3083.647s">Joseph's</a>  church. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3085.287s">You</a>  know, so, uh, listen, you want to put meters in that's fine, but don't put them in front of people's houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3091.508s">And</a>  especially you don't put them in front of houses of worship. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3095.169s">I</a>  never, I mean, we do have some scruples in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3099.389s">I</a>  hope to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3101.11s">And,</a>  um, and, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3103.693s">I</a>  got a call from the church eight o'clock Sunday morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3107.857s">I</a>  got a call from the school Monday morning, and I think I notified all the Councilors on Sunday that this was happening to stop planning on getting calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3116.605s">And</a>  when I sent the message to the mayor, the mayor told me she wasn't aware of the parking meters going in that far. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3125.885s">Um,</a>  at which point, you know, I told her that the gentleman was out there putting heads on the meters then. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3130.97s">And</a>  within an hour, she said that, um, they, uh, they finally had called someone to the department. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3137.876s">They</a>  stopped and they took the heads out. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3139.818s">But,</a>  um, and they did continue to put them on. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3142.561s">But,</a>  uh, driving today, I noticed that the polls are still on Boynton Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3147.305s">Boynton</a>  Road is a residential street. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3149.542s">put</a>  meters on residential streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3152.584s">I</a>  don't know what this department is thinking anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3156.486s">Tonight,</a>  there's going to be an approved have a party to celebrate this great achievement that we've done here. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3164.27s">I</a>  just don't understand it anymore.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3166.631s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3167.211s">Any</a>  further comments on this paper?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3170.813s">Yes,</a>  Madam President, I just think it's important to point out that, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3175.656s">Back</a>  in FY21, when we looked at the $6 million structural deficit that we had, and then again in FY22, when we looked at the $12 million structural deficit that we have in FY23, <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3193.79s">When</a>  we look at the old $700 million or so dollar structural deficit that we have, one of the things that I made very clear during the budget discussions was that we're not going to use the parking program to generate revenues and fill our budget shortfalls. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3208.986s">And</a>  I feel like that's what's happening, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3211.088s">We're</a>  expanding the park. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3212.25s">Now,</a>  three weeks, three weeks in a row, four weeks in a row, four meetings in a row. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3215.893s">We've</a>  had talk about parking right talk about parking talk about failures in the parking department, ticketing people but not supposed to get tickets going down the wrong street and giving everybody on the same street a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3226.338s">Now</a>  the expansion of meters into residential neighborhoods the expansion of meters in front of churches and places of worship and schools and funeral homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3234.321s">All</a>  right, it seems to me like we're trying to use this parking program to generate revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3239.462s">to</a>  address the structural shortfall.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3241.124s">Point</a>  of information, correct me if I'm wrong, I believe the conversation we had with the administration was a new growth was 1.8 million and 1.2 was directly from fees and fines of, so I think it's public. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3256.397s">I</a>  think that from what we were told back in those meetings that this is a process to <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3264.023s">raise</a>  revenue for our community, which is disheartening to me, right?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3267.907s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3268.707s">And,</a>  you know, the packing program when first initiated and first implemented was to turn over spots in the business districts and to enforce residential packing in neighborhoods that were budding public transportation areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3280.898s">that's</a>  expanded now into ninjas jumping out of trees and giving you tickets on if you're facing the wrong way if you don't have an inspection sticker if you have an expired sticker on your license plate uh you know it's it's getting it's getting a little out of hand yet um we get the residents on brook street that have been never-ending problem that's not going to be rectified anytime soon um parking still comes and gives them tickets um there's really no <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3308.572s">And</a>  there's been no dynamic amendment of any of these policy decisions that have been made to satisfy any of our constituency. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3315.696s">And</a>  it just seems to me like the reoccurring theme, if you agree, it's great, we'll hug. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3323.059s">If</a>  you disagree, it's gonna fall on deaf ears and no one's gonna talk to you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3328.682s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Mayne. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3331.023s">So</a>  moving on to our second petition for public participation, <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3336.492s">The</a>  Honorable City Council, Councilors, the undersigned respectfully pray for. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3339.513s">I</a>  would like to talk about the residential parking issues caused on Marion Street with no more residential window stickers being issued, no visitor permits in the windows, out of state plates, and no tickets being issued for any violations to discourage repeated behavior. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3353.495s">How</a>  are residents to know who is and is not supposed to be parking on the street without resident decals, petition signature, and T. Campbell, 75 Marion Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3363.917s">And</a>  again, we have your name and address for the record, so please go ahead.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3366.495s">That</a>  would be me, Ann Campbell, 75 Marion Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3370.336s">And</a>  I have an addendum to the previous statement because I work at St. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3374.777s">Joseph's</a>  School. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3376.717s">So</a>  I have a little aside to that last issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3381.418s">Last</a>  spring, I had called the mayor's office and requested a trash barrel be put at the bus stop right in front of St. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3389.8s">Joseph's</a>  School. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3391.49s">because</a>  people that get on the bus right in front of our door can't bring food or drinks on the bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3400.492s">So</a>  the mayor's office said, oh, well, you'll have to call the DPW to request a trash barrel, which I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3408.794s">I</a>  called the DPW and I said, we need a trash barrel at the bus stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3413.116s">And</a>  they said, oh, well, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3415.193s">You</a>  can't have a trash barrel at St. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3417.233s">Joseph</a>  school. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3418.534s">You're</a>  too far outside the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3421.074s">We</a>  can't do a trash pickup there. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3424.055s">So</a>  we're too far outside the square to get a trash barrel, but we're not too far outside the square to generate tax revenue with a meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3434.757s">So</a>  that kind of confounded us when we had the meters installed there. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3440.06s">So</a>  that was just kind of an aside that was a little bit insulting to us last week, but I'll let that one go. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3448.542s">So</a>  anyway, my issue was residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3452.263s">I</a>  live on Marion Street, which I have for 57 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3457.345s">We</a>  became a residential permit parking street three years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3462.866s">We</a>  recently have had a major uptick in people parking on the street without permits. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3470.789s">So</a>  I watched the council meeting two weeks ago and Faye Morrison was not able to stay. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3480.395s">So</a>  I couldn't ask the question then, but she made a comment that residential stickers for the windshields are no longer being used, which I was not aware of. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3492.982s">And</a>  she also said that there's no intention to bring those stickers back, which I also did not know about. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3501.577s">Well,</a>  how are we supposed to know who is and who is not supposed to be parking on our street? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3509.419s">You</a>  don't know if you don't see the decal in the window. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3513.58s">Well,</a>  she said, the enforcement scans the parking license plates. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3521.082s">Well,</a>  there is no enforcement because I don't see any tickets on any cars on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3528.569s">And</a>  I haven't in months and months. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3531.591s">There</a>  was the other day for the first time and I can't tell you how long. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3536.454s">Now,</a>  when we had Park Medford, I could send an email and they always responded. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3542.758s">They</a>  always came down if you sent an email. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3546.041s">I</a>  didn't even know who to address things to. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3549.563s">So</a>  I went on the website and I found George Bernoski's name. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3556.2s">and</a>  I found a telephone number. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3559.202s">So</a>  I called the phone number listed on the website and it said, one phone number said, we'll call you back as soon as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3568.169s">I</a>  got no response back from that phone number. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3572.152s">So</a>  I called the other phone number which said, we'll get back to you within 24 to 48 hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3579.073s">That</a>  was on September 22nd. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3582.995s">I</a>  still have not received a phone call back from parking department. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3588.619s">Then</a>  I decided to write an email to George Barnosky on September 24th. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3595.403s">I</a>  still have not received a response back from George Barnosky to my email. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3602.688s">So</a>  I'm getting no response back to my questions.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3607.067s">I'm</a>  pretty sure George Bernoski is like the media repairman. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3615.452s">I</a>  think his title is like supervisor of media repair or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3618.834s">I</a>  don't think he has any type of function that has to do with the supervision or the issuance of tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3623.056s">I</a>  think he's more of a <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3625.418s">a</a>  meter fixer, oversees the meter repair program. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3629.18s">If</a>  it's my recollection, I remember when the mayor put out one of her many emails about her new hires that she classified.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3637.044s">There</a>  were two names listed on the website for the traffic and parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3642.087s">So</a>  he was the one I addressed it to. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3644.408s">He</a>  didn't answer back. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3648.991s">And</a>  there's also a permitted street listing. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3653.042s">Marion</a>  Street isn't listed as a permitted street, and we've been permitted for three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3660.729s">So</a>  possibly that's why we're not getting any enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3664.492s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3665.333s">How</a>  often do they update the website? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3668.235s">I</a>  have no idea, but we're not getting enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3673.32s">We</a>  have lots of cars that I don't think belong there because none of the neighbors recognize them. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3680.154s">We</a>  have no decals in the windows, so we couldn't report them if we wanted to. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3685.377s">What</a>  are the neighbors supposed to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3687.358s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3689.379s">But</a>  there's no intention to bring the decals back. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3693.782s">How</a>  are you supposed to know who's supposed to park on a street where the neighbors pay for the decals, pay for the permits to park there, but anybody can park there and they don't have to pay.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3707.835s">So</a>  I'm just a little confused by it all. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3713.86s">So</a>  I'm just looking for some assistance for myself.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3718.063s">I</a>  don't even have to get the decal because I have off the street parking for myself, for my tenants and for the neighbors across the street that don't even have driveway. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3729.892s">I</a>  let them park in my yard on street sweeping days. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3734.266s">but</a>  not everybody has that luxury. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3736.968s">But</a>  because I'm the one that requested the permit parking in the first place, I go and I get the stickers. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3747.455s">But</a>  it's not working anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3751.037s">It</a>  used to work, but it doesn't work anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3753.259s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3755.24s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3755.72s">Thank</a>  you for coming out. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3757.561s">But</a>  I sense your frustration. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3761.234s">since</a>  our last meeting, talking about traffic and parking since we had the director on for a half hour to answer questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3768.558s">We've</a>  had about 30 phone calls and emails. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3770.999s">People</a>  have called me. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3772.42s">One</a>  thing we've recommended that maybe we stop, we reset, we educate both the enforcement officers and the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3782.805s">I</a>  think that that's what <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3787.096s">a</a>  responsible community does when you're unveiling such a huge, impactful scenario like traffic enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3797.305s">Um,</a>  to say that we don't need the sticker anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3800.866s">These</a>  are questions we had to ask, too, and we were cut short, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3803.967s">We</a>  didn't realize I know that Councilor Morell did. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3806.687s">President</a>  Morell did a great job even getting the director here just for, you know, a half hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3812.809s">And</a>  we were told what before the meeting that she was leaving at seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3817.69s">And</a>  after her 30-minute presentation of a presentation she sent us, and then listening to just a few people, there's so many questions still need to be answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3826.656s">This</a>  is frustrating for everyone, yourself, us, because we don't know what to tell you. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3833.18s">That's</a>  what the sad piece is. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3837.163s">And</a>  I don't blame the traffic enforcement officers that they hired, because it's not their fault either. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3842.401s">You</a>  know, when you have three people on the road in the city that met with size and they added all of these residential streets and sidewalks and streets and roadways and said, okay, now let's police those areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3854.59s">It's</a>  impossible to get to Marion street in a daily basis, let alone a weekly basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3858.933s">So</a>  maybe it is wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3860.975s">Maybe</a>  they don't have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3862.256s">We</a>  had a resident come up and tell us that they ticketed 40 tickets on one street. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3866.899s">And</a>  when they asked the question of what problem was, <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3870.447s">They</a>  gave them the wrong street. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3871.528s">They</a>  weren't even on their street. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3874.29s">They</a>  named a street that has a car wash on it and that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3878.614s">So</a>  that just tells you the frustration. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3881.217s">And</a>  I know I get a phone call from a resident said that they were actually, they were enlightened that the enforcement officer came down the street and gave warnings. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3894.011s">We</a>  asked, instead of giving the ticket, why don't you just give a warning so they can, the residents can be proactive and correct the situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3902.858s">And</a>  the director, I believe the director said what, that the dogs would attack them if they get out of the car and gave a warning. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3911.085s">I</a>  guess that dogs are very scared of tickets, just like us. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3914.748s">So</a>  they won't attack with the tickets, but with the warning, they won't. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3919.756s">The</a>  resident called me, said he had a conversation with the gentleman that came out and said, well, the director said that she was not going to give warnings. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3928.064s">And</a>  they said, that's not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3929.565s">And</a>  we were all in the meeting saying, I'm a little confused because the dog doesn't know how to wag the tail. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3935.03s">So</a>  it's getting frustrating. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3937.478s">So,</a>  and again, I will call, I would love to call another meeting, a Committee of the Whole meeting where we bring city administration, a traffic enforcement director back out in front of us to answer some of these questions that still have yet to be answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3951.002s">And,</a>  you know, the situation at St. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3953.183s">Joe's,</a>  if it wasn't for Ricky's phone call and reaching out and getting everybody involved, they'd be meters there. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3962.611s">and</a>  people be getting ticket and towed. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3964.552s">So</a>  there's a lot of questions still have to be answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3967.333s">There's</a>  a lot of concerns in this community about a traffic program. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3971.095s">So</a>  I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3973.056s">I</a>  wish I had an answer for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3975.257s">My</a>  recommendation again would be to, <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3979.081s">review,</a>  do an audit of all of these concerns that we have with our residents, with the director and her team, to see what we can do to mitigate any future concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3990.645s">Because</a>  I can't imagine how bad this is going to be once we have to park on one side of the street or the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3997.488s">And</a>  how are they going to enforce this? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4000.509s">It's</a>  going to be a real scary winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4004.41s">You</a>  know, this is just a prelude to what we're seeing. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4006.492s">So</a>  again, I wish we could do more. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4009.734s">We</a>  feel your frustration. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4012.276s">But</a>  again, all we can do is, you know, maybe ask for another meeting with the director, because it seems to be that that's the only person that can answer our questions.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4023.964s">And</a>  a half an hour wasn't enough.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4025.565s">No,</a>  it wasn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4026.065s">I</a>  agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4026.766s">And</a>  we told them that. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4028.267s">And</a>  Council President worked her tail off just to make sure that she was here. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4032.589s">So</a>  it floored us when we heard that we have a half hour and there were 30 people waiting to talk about some, you know, just to get an answer, just like you did. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4040.714s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4041.6s">And</a>  unfortunately, you're here today to express that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4044.521s">And</a>  we can't really give you the answer that good or bad, because at least we can have closure if there was someone that could give us something. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4052.504s">And</a>  I don't have much faith you get that phone call, by the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4055.466s">I</a>  apologize for that.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4056.146s">No,</a>  I noticed that.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4057.006s">But</a>  I would really try to call the communications department, the mayor's office, chief of staff, and ask their guidance on who you should call, because you've obviously tried the numbers that were there. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4066.67s">So</a>  that would be my recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4069.052s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4069.932s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4070.232s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4070.493s">Thank</a>  you for listening.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4071.513s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4072.634s">Going</a>  to Councilor Kalas and Vice Mayor Bears.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4075.816s">Thank</a>  you, President Merlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4077.057s">Thank</a>  you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4077.517s">Campbell,</a>  for being here tonight and to the other residents that are speaking about their experiences with parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4085.682s">The</a>  last time we spoke about this, <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4089.399s">Yeah,</a>  I know, I'm like, what instance was it? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4092.201s">I</a>  made the comment, I think something along the lines of, you know, wondering because of the volume of complaints that we've been getting about residents' experience with parking and also complaints from within the parking department itself, from the rank and file and from the leadership wondering, was this department set up to succeed or was it set up to fail? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4110.513s">And</a>  listening to, you know, the resident experience, <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4119.306s">you</a>  know, the new parking rules as they're filtering through the residence experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4123.91s">It</a>  strikes me that, you know, something that my dad used to tell me about writing is, you know, you can't brainstorm and edit at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4131.878s">You</a>  can't write and edit at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4134.04s">And</a>  I know from conversations with director Morrison that there's, sorry, this whole circus going on over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4138.945s">I'm</a>  a little distracted. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4139.886s">I</a>  don't know what's going on.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4142.124s">And</a>  also, my advice was embarrassed. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4143.965s">I'm</a>  rapidly losing my voice, so I apologize for continued distractions.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4147.687s">That's</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4149.248s">You</a>  know, you can't write and edit at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4150.889s">And</a>  I know that it's a huge mantle to spin up a whole new city department from nothing, you know, from a contractor that I think, you know, a lot of sources have said was mismanaging our parking system in the city beforehand. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4162.015s">But</a>  it brings me back to that same question about was this department set up to succeed? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4166.717s">Was</a>  it set up to fail? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4168.518s">Is</a>  it even conceivable that a project of this scale <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4171.62s">could</a>  be started and refined and take back resident feedback and be guided and be modifying what it's doing all at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4180.024s">And</a>  it seems like that isn't really happening based on what we're hearing from residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4186.468s">And</a>  I know that, you know, it's our parking department staff that's executing the work on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4194.612s">But,</a>  you know, we get very strong city communications about certain topics from our city administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4200.915s">about</a>  certain types of events and certain types of updates and certain types of developments in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4206.596s">And,</a>  you know, I'm really upset about the adverse effects of the new parking program on residents when they've been burdened by this and when they felt unheard. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4217.179s">But</a>  I'm also upset that the city administration isn't stepping up and taking more of the <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4222.08s">of</a>  the Brunton more the responsibility for directing this, um, in the way that I think it's their responsibility to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4229.182s">And</a>  so you know, we seem to have a great capacity for communicating about certain types of developments and certain types of updates in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4235.643s">And</a>  I think I think we're past due for seeing more of that capacity spread to the parking department, not just that it's more fair to the rank and file parking staff, the ones that are charged with just executing. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4246.266s">the</a>  protocols, but also for the benefit of the residents who months later are still struggling to stay up to date with what's already been said about what we can expect. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4253.728s">Why</a>  is this happening? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4254.628s">When</a>  is it going to change? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4255.548s">Is</a>  it going to change? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4257.329s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4259.309s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4262.19s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4264.491s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4266.131s">Councilor</a>  Collins made a point, but was this program set up to fail? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4271.573s">It</a>  probably was. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4272.875s">You</a>  know, you open a department of this size, and the administration touted, what a great job did they get it up and running in such a short period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4282.884s">Well,</a>  it wasn't a great job getting done in a short period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4286.287s">The</a>  program needed more time to be refined and figured out what had to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4291.512s">Again,</a>  for the members who weren't here, when Park Metro came in, Park Metro came in at a bad time. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4297.177s">They</a>  realized they made mistakes. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4298.998s">They</a>  stopped. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4300.844s">They</a>  took three, four more months and figured out what they were doing wrong, what was wrong, and they fixed it and rolled the program out again. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4309.09s">This</a>  program doesn't want to admit that it's made any mistakes. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4315.035s">And</a>  it's made many mistakes. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4316.936s">One</a>  of the questions I wanted to ask last week was, <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4320.082s">When</a>  they were ticketing all the streets, all the cars on the streets with wrong addresses, what about all the people who just didn't have the time to appeal to them and they just say, hey, I'll pay the $25 because I don't have time to go to registry. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4332.327s">I</a>  don't have the time to say, hey, maybe I was wrong and just pay the $25. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4335.769s">Are</a>  any of those people getting their money back? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4339.07s">No</a>  idea, no idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4341.031s">And</a>  again, you know, like I said, calls are still coming in all over the place from all different parts of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4346.971s">And</a>  again, it's a program that was put out with a bum's rush and instead of the thought that it took to put the, especially with the meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4358.239s">Well,</a>  it was a bit, at the end of the day, when it was all done, the answer that came back was, it was a miscommunication. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4367.162s">another</a>  miscommunication. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4368.243s">There's</a>  been a lot of miscommunications. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4370.524s">Again,</a>  Councilor Scott is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4372.425s">We</a>  made a motion a couple of weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4375.626s">Stop</a>  ticketing people until you figure out that we're doing it right. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4380.689s">Let's</a>  get the program fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4382.39s">Don't</a>  keep going in a bad direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4387.432s">Sheila's</a>  on Marion Street, which is a pretty crowded street. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4391.935s">I</a>  grew up on William Street, which was the next street. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4394.676s">Wait</a>  till the train station comes in over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4398.589s">She's</a>  within walking distance of the ball street, of the ball square station. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4403.312s">What</a>  do you think, people aren't gonna be parking in our neighborhood then? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4405.874s">All</a>  over Winchester Street and all those surrounding streets? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4409.636s">There's</a>  not even any talk about that when that station opens up, coming down the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4415.48s">And</a>  nevermind about the station at Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4419.903s">all</a>  those hillside streets are gonna be, and all those streets down in College Ave are gonna be people walking, parking the cars and walking. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4426.749s">There's</a>  no talk about doing anything over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4428.851s">So</a>  again, I think it's time that we stop, that this program stop and reassess and figure out what is doing wrong and let's figure it out and do it right.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4441.121s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4442.042s">I</a>  mean, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4449.502s">No,</a>  I still have. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4450.222s">There's</a>  still another.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4452.623s">If</a>  I may, from the chair, just add a couple of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4456.365s">One</a>  is that I can't remember when we filed. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4459.786s">I</a>  filed it or we passed it, but we have requested that the traffic and parking decisions and rules and regulations actually be posted on the city website. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4467.789s">They're</a>  currently not, which would be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4471.151s">And</a>  then as pertains to these specific issues, if possible, Mr. Clerk, if you <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4479.736s">I</a>  think that maybe we'll get an answer since you haven't received a response. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4482.879s">Maybe</a>  we will get one faster.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4484.1s">But</a>  that's just something I was going to say before I came up to be the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4492.187s">President</a>  Morales.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4493.36s">I'll</a>  be brief because I don't really have a voice, but I also do just have concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4496.161s">I</a>  mean, things like putting in meter heads that need to be immediately removed, that costs money. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4500.563s">What</a>  kind of money are we losing? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4502.023s">I</a>  mean, these are costly mistakes. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4503.984s">At</a>  a department that I understand needs a certain amount of funding to get up and running, but this is stuff that's easily avoided. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4509.306s">So</a>  that just gives me great pause.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4517.409s">Any</a>  further discussion on this petition? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4520.434s">Any</a>  other folks who'd like to speak public participation is open. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4523.615s">Please</a>  come to the podium.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4530.616s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[KttEmL8hj40_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4534.117s">Read</a>  about how we won 35 High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4536.758s">The</a>  day that I put the meters and after I spoke to Mr. Caraviello, I called mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4542.079s">I</a>  called parking, um, talking director and, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4547.776s">I</a>  went to Miss Morrison's office and someone from her office called and said that it was not the jurisdiction that I needed to call Chief Buckley, that it was traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4558.765s">So</a>  I called traffic and they weren't aware that there were any meters installed anywhere in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4565.59s">And</a>  they said that it was not the jurisdiction that it belonged back over to the parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4571.735s">So</a>  I called parking back and told them, you know, you're probably going to get a lot of phone calls because <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4576.487s">You're</a>  telling people to go to traffic and traffic is telling them to come back to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4580.93s">I</a>  called the mayor's office and I did get a response from her administrator that said that they weren't aware of the meters either. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4591.116s">And</a>  my thing is somebody had to authorize it. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4594.318s">Somebody</a>  had to sign an expenditure to pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4597.92s">And</a>  nobody knows what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4600.061s">And</a>  nobody wants to take ownership for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4602.609s">And</a>  for myself with a meter in front of my house, it's awful. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4606.51s">And</a>  it's also, I'm not thinking of selling my house, but if I were, who's gonna buy a house with a meter in front of it? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4612.372s">I</a>  certainly wouldn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4614.392s">So</a>  between the church and private residents and nobody knows what's going on and wants to take ownership for it, it's just crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4624.855s">So</a>  somebody had to sign to pay for people to come out, to put the poles in, <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4631.849s">to</a>  pay for the man that was out there ready to install the meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4637.134s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4637.535s">It</a>  just doesn't make sense.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4639.657s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4640.257s">I</a>  can tell you for a fact that the mayor is the person who signed off on it because there was an ARPA expenditure that basically we're using federal ARPA funds to fund this meter project. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4648.705s">And</a>  she's decided that the council has no involvement in how those funds are going to be expended. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4652.909s">So</a>  if it was approved, it was approved by the mayor.</p>

    <p>[KttEmL8hj40_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4656.918s">And</a>  for us, parking is a big deal because High Street's a busy street. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4660.902s">We</a>  have the library right next to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4662.363s">We</a>  have the church across the street from us. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4664.225s">We</a>  have to deal with snow emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4666.847s">So</a>  we have to get our cars off the street when there's a snow emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4670.01s">So</a>  technically we can park on Boynton, but even at that, we have two apartment buildings on High Street too. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4677.317s">There's</a>  just way too many cars and not enough places to put them. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4681.242s">So</a>  last winter, and I've lived in my house for 38 years, so I'm not new to the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4686.264s">I've</a>  lived in Medford all my life. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4688.404s">And</a>  so a couple of the snow storms, you know, we parked on Boynton, people were parked on both sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4695.226s">No</a>  one got ticketed, nothing happened, even though there's just the parking on one side, but the parking is so very limited that people were parked there, so we parked there. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4705.129s">Nothing</a>  happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4705.789s">First</a>  snow storm, nothing happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4707.21s">Second</a>  snow storm, <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4708.75s">Third</a>  snow emergency, everybody was parked on both sides and all of a sudden we go out in the morning, cars are towed, they're ticketed. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4716.854s">There's</a>  just no consistency. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4719.895s">You</a>  can do it one time and nothing happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4722.636s">You</a>  do it the next time and your car's towed and you're ticketed. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4727.238s">So</a>  I don't think anybody knows what's going on with our traffic and parking at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4733.221s">At</a>  least before you knew, okay, this year you park on that side, next year you park on another side. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4738.48s">but</a>  you don't know what to do anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4741.601s">So</a>  that's my two cents. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4744.483s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4746.704s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4749.025s">I'd</a>  like to get a cost on, what a cost to put in all those poles, those extra poles that weren't necessary, the cost of removing them, and we bought meter heads for all those extra poles. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4761.53s">Where</a>  are all those meter heads now that aren't going on, that we're planning on going on? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4767.167s">Are</a>  the poles going to be removed from Boynton Road? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4769.648s">There's</a>  still meter poles on Boynton Road on both sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4774.149s">Are</a>  those going to be taken out? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4776.129s">How</a>  much did it cost that we put them in? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4777.89s">How</a>  many extra meterheads did we buy that we were probably another 30 more meterheads that we probably didn't have to buy because we didn't need them all. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4786.431s">So</a>  I'd like to make that in the form of a motion.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4794.269s">could</a>  we do it as a resolution next week? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4797.21s">We'll</a>  do it on the ice cream truck. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4798.991s">We'll</a>  do it on the ice cream truck. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4799.971s">There</a>  are other items on parking.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4801.292s">We'll</a>  hold it later, but that's a concern of mine, how much money we spent on all those extra meat heads, installing those poles and taking the poles out.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4808.855s">Ian.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4809.396s">There's</a>  a couple more items on parking that we can attach it to later in the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4814.998s">All</a>  right, those were the two public participation.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4817.839s">We</a>  do have community participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4819.34s">I</a>  have a source. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4820.66s">I</a>  know we have a resident that wants to come up and speak.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4824.764s">Again,</a>  this is public participation on any topic if you could just have your name and address for the record please.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4916.422s">Thank</a>  you for bringing that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4917.903s">I</a>  know that there should be rodent control mitigation, so I'll go to Councilor Scarpelli on that.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4921.625s">No,</a>  I think that that's whenever we're doing, we made sure, especially with the problems we've had with the rodents, that there should be some mitigation in the agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4929.87s">So</a>  unfortunately, we can't do it because of public participation, but <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4934.032s">we</a>  could do is file a resolution next week to have all the city departments, the health commissioner and our city engineer that oversees the project to look into making sure that there's some whatever's in place needs to be in place and then and shared with the council so we can get back to you and your neighbors so they they can know something's being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4956.361s">So</a>  I <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4957.982s">again</a>  especially when you do we talked about this whenever the roads are being open we know that we're going to have uh a manifestation of rodents and that's why we made sure we put those uh those those uh plans in place to mitigate that so hopefully we can remedy that for you but thanks for coming up and sharing that Mr. Chubbs. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4977.372s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5297.653s">So</a>  it says that this is a, what, a replacement project? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5300.834s">A</a>  relocation project? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5301.795s">They're</a>  relocating the gas main on Walnut Street, why?</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5305.336s">We're</a>  getting out of the way so the city can come in and do some water work. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5308.097s">They'll</a>  come in after we do our work and they will be repaving the streets.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5314.032s">She</a>  said that the city is doing water work. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5315.673s">They're</a>  getting out of the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5316.514s">So</a>  the city water main works.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5321.358s">You're</a>  off right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5322.879s">Similar</a>  to the work necessary on Riverside Ave, sounds like. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5328.424s">Well,</a>  you guys don't necessarily want to do this, but they have to do water works. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5331.206s">Are</a>  you going to get out of the way?</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5335.45s">Yes,</a>  it's on Metcalfe Street and Walnut Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5338.852s">It's</a>  approximately 730 feet on Walnut Street, from south to summer, and 690 feet on Metcalfe Street.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5354.36s">That's</a>  a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5356.041s">So</a>  is the restoration going to be done curb to curb, or is it going to be one of these six inch trenches out to the middle of a street that in six months is going to fall apart and turn this into 600 feet of potholes?</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5365.987s">So</a>  the city will come in after our work. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5368.869s">we're</a>  as part of the project we're going to walk this site with the city engineer to do whatever short term patch, they're requiring when we get when we apply for the permit, and then the city will come in after us, dig the street back up again, right where we moved our pipe over so that they can do some water to see my notes as again, some water, water supply. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5397.044s">work</a>  by the city method and then the city will go back and pay the street.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5402.149s">Does</a>  this have anything to do with the loan order that we just passed? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5406.434s">No,</a>  no, right. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5407.815s">We</a>  have it as a city engineer available.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5409.797s">Mr.</a>  Clark, do you have anyone from the city engineer's office or from DPW on the phone?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5510.297s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5512.178s">Quite</a>  frequently I get calls, especially surrounding some of these car repair facilities automobile repair facilities along Mr. Avenue, relative to the amount of footprint that vehicles take up. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5525.707s">And</a>  also the parking of vehicles that they're servicing on public roads in public parking spots. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5533.313s">So,</a>  one thing I've noticed is every time we get a permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5537.255s">application</a>  before us that the traffic commission has to sign off saying that there'll be no traffic impact, but they failed to look at parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5545.158s">They</a>  failed to look at the parking impact of this proposed business. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5547.638s">So</a>  this proposed service might create. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5550.639s">So</a>  what I'm asking is that the administration revamp the criteria in establishing these reviews to also take into consideration the parking impacts so that we have a better idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5561.123s">We</a>  vote for something, what the parking impacts are as well as the traffic impacts. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5565.882s">much</a>  to ask for. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5566.543s">I</a>  think the administration could do a parking assessment or even maybe establish a certain criteria that would say the sex amount of parking spots per square feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5574.671s">And</a>  that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5575.191s">Very</a>  similar to what we have in our zoning ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5578.535s">But</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, what we're seeing, especially if you go down ST James Avenue and some of those streets off of Mystic Avenue, <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5585.221s">is</a>  that every single parking spot is taken up by vehicles all day long. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5588.324s">Then</a>  six o'clock comes, the sidewalk rolls up and all those guys disappear. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5592.248s">Then</a>  six o'clock in the morning, all those cars are back there again, but they're not people working. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5596.092s">Those</a>  are cars that are being worked on. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5597.273s">They're</a>  being moved in and out of garages and being put in the street and being put back in the garage. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5601.217s">All</a>  right, well, it's a public way. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5602.418s">Those</a>  parking spots are also necessary for other businesses to utilize. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5605.441s">They</a>  should be turned over. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5606.422s">I</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5615.524s">But</a>  ultimately, I think this is something that needs to be looked at, because it does certainly have an impact on, number one, public safety, and number two, our ability to turn over pockets and generate business for business owners and business storefronts in the downtown area.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5630.412s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, I thank counsel for bringing this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5635.176s">I've</a>  had many discussions with the chief about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5638.278s">And</a>  the chief has assured me that he was going to take the role on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5642.442s">Because</a>  of the amount of complaints that we're getting from all those businesses over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5647.166s">Not</a>  only in that little area, but you know, you get on Columbia, Columbia Street there. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5652.11s">People</a>  can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5653.351s">Those</a>  are all <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5654.158s">backed</a>  up with cars from the place next to Grava. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5658.141s">I</a>  think they had a permit for 12 cars and they got about 50 in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5661.943s">And</a>  then in back of Grava is another body shop that just opened up. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5666.866s">And</a>  they say, these places just keep coming over and over. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5671.309s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5673.659s">What's</a>  happening is their employees are parking there. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5677.14s">Not</a>  only are they pulling the cars out of the garages, but the employees are parking there. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5681.18s">And</a>  now there's going to be a cannabis delivery service over there coming in soon, which I think got approved last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5688.362s">Though</a>  they've assured me that all their parking will be indoors, there'll be no cars on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5693.423s">I</a>  hope that's what they told me is true, and I'll take them for their word on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5701.094s">And</a>  then you get all of the oil companies that go up and down that street. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5705.857s">Have</a>  you ever driven down the street with your car? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5709.179s">I'll</a>  tell you, there's going to be a day that comes and an oil truck is going to spring a leak. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5716.12s">from</a>  hitting one of those bumps on that on on that street that that's that's in such disrepair. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5720.604s">There's</a>  gonna be thousands of gallons of crude oil spilled on our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5724.707s">So</a>  I say I spoke with the chief many times on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5728.37s">He's</a>  told me he's gonna take the lead, but I haven't seen any action from the chief on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5731.773s">And</a>  thanks. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5732.213s">Thank</a>  you for bringing this forward, because this is a problem for all the businesses in that neighborhood.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5904.662s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5906.283s">This</a>  council voted $1,000,000 for sidewalks, another half a million dollars for stumps. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5910.224s">The</a>  only people I've seen working on the sidewalks have been city employees and on the stumps. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5918.226s">So</a>  I want to know where we are with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5922.247s">Has</a>  the contract been bid out yet? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5925.288s">we're</a>  into October, and November's next in a few weeks, the cold's gonna come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5932.489s">Are</a>  we gonna be doing like we've done in the past, pouring concrete in the middle of December, so within six months it's coming up? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5941.471s">Again,</a>  I just don't see the amount of people out there doing work on sidewalks and stumps for the money that we put out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5947.952s">I</a>  wanna know, say, have these contracts even been bid out yet? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5953.52s">So</a>  if we if we can get a report for the administration, be appreciated.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5957.882s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Caraviello seconded by second Councilor Tseng all those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5963.343s">Opposed.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5963.984s">Motion</a>  passes to do this 531 offered by Councilor Caraviello be it so resolved that the Director of Energy and Sustainability update the Council and residents of the newly agreed <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5973.695s">aggregate</a>  electricity contract.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5975.296s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5978.337s">I</a>  think we have the Alicia Hunter on the line tonight to explain to let the residents know about this, about the aggregate contract that we've just <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5988.606s">sign</a>  that are renewed again. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5990.707s">I</a>  don't know if you're following the news, they're talking that by December, electric bills are going to be skyrocketing, almost doubling of what they are from right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5999.768s">So</a>  if Alicia can give us a little update on what kind of rate we've got, and I know it's been out there, but for the people who haven't seen it in the paper or whatever, if she can just give us a little brief synopsis of what's going on there.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6014.691s">Yes,</a>  Mr. Clerk, if you could recognize Director Hunt.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6018.489s">Yes,</a>  good evening, councillors. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6020.15s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6021.171s">Thank</a>  you very much to Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6023.232s">As</a>  I'm starting, would you mind allowing me to share screen for a minute? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6027.755s">I</a>  have a few images that to help the residents with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6032.238s">So</a>  as people are very aware in Massachusetts right now, the utility rates, the electric rates are going up very high in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6041.323s">Several</a>  years ago, Medford passed community choice aggregation, which allows the city to negotiate for basically to go out to bid for an electricity rate on behalf of the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6054.375s">A</a>  lot of residents are in this program, but a lot of residents are not. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6058.259s">And</a>  part of why I wanted to be here this evening is that we are, in fact, getting a lot of questions from residents about this in my office. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6067.265s">And</a>  we're getting when we talk to people at Oktoberfest, they were very excited to hear that we had something we could do to help with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6075.831s">And</a>  in fact, we are getting the senior centers also getting a lot of questions about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6082.435s">Can</a>  you see the screen, the slide that I have up now? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6088.717s">It</a>  looks like you can see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6091.18s">So</a>  I wanted to share with the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6095.624s">So</a>  this is Medford's program. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6097.786s">There</a>  are a lot of numbers on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6099.968s">Our</a>  rate is going up from where it has been. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6103.251s">We've</a>  had one rate fixed in for three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6106.213s">A</a>  lot of people were very astute and noticed that our rates were expiring in December, which was correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6111.656s">We</a>  have a new contract that is for two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6114.479s">The</a>  electricity market is so out of control that we couldn't get a good contract for three years, which is why our new contract is for two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6123.967s">Everybody</a>  goes by default into this Medford local green, which will be 15.3 cents per kilowatt hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6132.431s">If</a>  you look over on the far column, the national grid rate, that if you are on National Grid basic service, you're going to go up to 33.8 cents a kilowatt hour, which is why we're saying this winter, you don't want to be in National Grid's basic service. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6149.061s">I</a>  will take a moment to just say there's an option through this to opt up to 100% local renewable energy. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6155.586s">It's</a>  a little bit more. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6156.626s">It's</a>  18.9 cents a kilowatt hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6160.54s">But</a>  again, that's a choice that you can opt up to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6164.862s">A</a>  lot of people are calling and asking, how do they know if they're already in the program? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6171.065s">If</a>  you look at your electricity bill, on the third page of the bill is a section here that's called supply services. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6179.39s">And</a>  if you are in Medford's aggregation, it will look like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6183.552s">It'll</a>  say Dynegy Medford aggregation, and it'll look like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6188.92s">And</a>  then you are in it, you don't need to do anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6192.822s">You'll</a>  see that your rate right now is 11.5 cents, it'll go up. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6197.204s">This</a>  is actually the current 100% green rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6201.107s">Sorry,</a>  I used 100% green bill as an example. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6205.389s">If</a>  you look at your third page of your bill and it looks like this, supply services, national grid, basic service fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6213.635s">then</a>  you are in National Grid's default service, and you're going to go up to the 33 cents. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6221.224s">And</a>  frankly, we recommend that you switch to something. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6224.968s">And</a>  I'm only allowed to recommend things that we've gone out to bid for, so I can't recommend anybody else. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6232.409s">If</a>  you come to this page, and it looks like this, but it doesn't say Dynegy, it says something else. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6237.471s">It</a>  could say Constellation, or Direct Energy, or Clean Choice, or something. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6241.853s">Then</a>  you should look at what your rate is, and you should see what your rate looks like, how does that compare to what the city's rate is going to be, and make a decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6251.599s">If</a>  you have one of those other companies, you'll have a phone number here. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6255.444s">We</a>  are talking to people who have good rates here, something in the 11, 12, 13 cents. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6258.609s">That's</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6258.87s">We've</a>  also seen 25, 30 cents, 35 cents here. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6266.147s">with</a>  those other companies. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6268.268s">So</a>  if you don't wanna have to think about it, we'll manage it for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6273.051s">It's</a>  your choice at this point to opt in or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6278.394s">This</a>  is some information about how to enroll. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6281.136s">There's</a>  a webpage medfordcea.com. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6285.418s">And</a>  if you go to slash enroll, there's a phone number that you can call to enroll. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6291.542s">866-220-5696.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6296.347s">Our</a>  consultants are Good Energy. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6298.769s">They</a>  will be at the Medford Council on Aging again this week on Thursday, and you can call the Council of Aging and make an appointment. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6307.739s">If</a>  they get too many people that it's too crowded, then we'll have them come back another week. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6313.564s">This</a>  consultant will also be at the Harvester Energy Festival this weekend on Saturday from 12 to 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6321.489s">If</a>  you bring your electric bill with you, he can help you look at it and help advise you on what program you're in. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6327.753s">I</a>  just was asked by my staff that answers the phone to hit a couple of answers to questions that they're getting a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6339.898s">All</a>  residential households were automatically enrolled in the program several years ago with mailings before that announcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6347.364s">And</a>  people could opt out, some people chose to, some people never realized that they were in the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6354.209s">The</a>  main goal of this program is to provide price stability, so you're not impacted by these major fluctuations. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6363.533s">You</a>  will continue to get your electricity from National Grid. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6367.577s">You</a>  will get one bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6368.878s">It'll</a>  be from National Grid. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6370.881s">And</a>  like I said, it'll just have this section on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6374.344s">This</a>  is on your regular utility bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6376.787s">National</a>  Grid is still responsible for any power outages, any repairs, any issues with your electricity. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6384.597s">Um,</a>  you can opt out or opt into our program at any time with no fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6390.481s">The</a>  city has the contract, not the individuals. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6393.403s">So</a>  you got, you can come and go as you please. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6397.106s">Um,</a>  sorry, there are just so many things that people have been calling and asking our office about. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6400.949s">The</a>  other one is that yes, it includes some local renewable energy. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6405.773s">We</a>  buy that through Green Energy Consumer Alliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6409.476s">And</a>  if you opt up to the 100%, a portion of that becomes tax deductible, the difference between what you would have paid and what you pay for the extra green. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6421.165s">And</a>  Green Energy Consumer Alliance will send you a letter in January that you can use on your taxes for the tax deductible part of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6430.692s">there</a>  is the option to opt down to the Medford Basic amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6435.693s">And</a>  I'll just show you that it is 0.2, it's two tenths of a penny less to go with the Medford Basic that has no extra renewable energy in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6448.535s">And</a>  I think those are, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6452.196s">Are</a>  there any questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6453.456s">Should</a>  I answer anything for the council?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6454.996s">Any</a>  questions by members of the council?</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6462.066s">I'm</a>  not a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6462.847s">I</a>  just wanted to thank your office for working on this and tell everyone that to definitely take some time out of your evening to walk through and check your bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6473.016s">I</a>  called my parents, and they were not on the aggregation. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6478.561s">and</a>  just by that simple check, my parents are gonna save so much money in the next two years, and especially in a difficult economic time with higher prices, this is something that families can do to save some money and help our city as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6498.205s">So</a>  thank you very much for this.</p>

    <p>[Matthew Page-Lieberman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6516.36s">Yes,</a>  I just I want to speak to thank Director Hunt. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6519.322s">Oh,</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6519.642s">My</a>  name is Matthew Papes Lieberman on 15 Canal Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6522.405s">So</a>  yeah, I wanted to thank Director Hunt because <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6525.598s">I</a>  have, as far as this energy aggregation program we have, and there are many, many cities in the Commonwealth that don't have that. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6533.903s">I</a>  used to attend these hearings, the joint hearings at the state house. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6541.087s">And</a>  there are a lot of cities that have been on the waiting list and they're not getting the approval that Alicia's department or Director Hunt's department was able to get for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6550.913s">I</a>  know that when I've had questions and I've been in that department, I've asked, <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6554.955s">I've</a>  always been helped. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6556.096s">I've</a>  been in this city for over a decade, worked with a lot of different department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6561.778s">There've</a>  been quite a few different administrations. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6564.279s">I've</a>  had many good experiences at City Hall, bad experiences at City Hall with some department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6569.942s">I</a>  think that there's a big narrative that we hear a lot about how everything's dysfunctional there and about how nobody's responsive. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6575.724s">But</a>  in my experience, departments like Director Hunt's are ones that we could consider ourselves, I think, very, very fortunate to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6584.308s">I</a>  really thank Director Hunt for that administration.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6591.091s">Thank</a>  you, Matt.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6766.115s">I</a>  wanted to thank you and President Morell for putting this on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6770.399s">This</a>  is some of the most exciting work that we are working on as a council and we'll have the chance, the opportunity to work on the council for the next few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6780.448s">That</a>  legal money, we fought very, very hard for it on this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6785.192s">We</a>  really <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6786.293s">stayed</a>  together and really aligned our priorities so we can get started on projects like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6792.215s">And</a>  this is that very important step that we have to take on this council to meet our objectives as a community when it comes to all these different plans, when it comes to housing, when it comes to the environment, when it comes to zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6804.84s">And</a>  we've already seen all the fruits of our labor and the labor of Council's past when it comes to zoning and that major zoning recodification that we passed earlier this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6819.425s">We</a>  see that new growth is slowly but surely coming to the Council because of that work that this Council and Council's past have done. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6827.888s">And</a>  I feel optimistic about the work that we can do going forward.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7280.833s">Okay,</a>  so it is an absolute nightmare of a location. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7285.934s">And</a>  to add more traffic, this is why I get a little disappointed in the traffic impact reports, there's no traffic impact anticipated. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7297.597s">Now</a>  we're looking to add 50 vehicles to this process?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7300.578s">50</a>  vehicles would be to the auxiliary parking, but the FlexDrive program already operates in the market. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7309.18s">This</a>  would be a relocation to this space.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7313.762s">Right,</a>  so this is why I'm a little confused on why put 616. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7317.923s">If</a>  that's the case, you said that the drivers have an opportunity to go to the 616 location for <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7325.941s">That</a>  is correct.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7328.302s">Yeah,</a>  so currently drivers go to 616 to get any driver support to get on boarded. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7333.204s">But</a>  what we're adding is drivers can now make an appointment to come to the location to pick up a vehicle for rentals. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7340.507s">And</a>  something to note about our rental program is that the most drivers hold on to the vehicles for a long period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7348.971s">It's</a>  not like a traditional rental operations where you have somebody coming in for a weekend trip or a day trip, <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7355.738s">It's</a>  something that drivers hold on to the vehicles for quite some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7359.383s">So</a>  it's not your traditional rental like in and out type of traffic due to the fact that drivers really do come in an appointment only and hold on to these vehicles for a long period of time.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7371.368s">So,</a>  and then the other location, it's a hub where they're going to be parked in the parking lot or in the garage?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7378.353s">Yeah,</a>  so the parking garage, it will just be auxiliary parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7381.855s">Drivers</a>  will not be going into that space. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7384.577s">That</a>  will only be employees that would be using that for overnight parking or vehicles that are being parked at the time.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7393.322s">So</a>  all those automobiles that'll be parked in Medford are registered through Medford in Medford?</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7402.177s">I</a>  don't know if I know how to answer that question.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7405.558s">Well,</a>  I mean, if we're parking 50 automobiles in our city, Medford accepts excise tax for automobiles that are parked and based in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7418.0s">Are</a>  those 50 cars based in going to pay excise tax in our community?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7423.642s">I</a>  believe so because the operations are out of that space or out of the 616 Bellsway space.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7431.292s">Do</a>  you have any more assurances than I believe so?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7434.027s">No,</a>  I would have to get that confirmation. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7435.868s">I</a>  apologize.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7436.729s">So</a>  for many different reasons, one being that we don't have a city solicitor that if I had questions that I can call to ask the legal questions dealing with this and the fact that this is something first time I've heard of this, you're looking at two locations and 50 more automobiles that will be parked in. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7458.365s">Is</a>  there a negotiation between you and the lift and the <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7463.549s">garage</a>  companies. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7466.151s">Is</a>  there is there an agreement between them?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7470.154s">Yes,</a>  between Flex Drive and the parking lot, we would be facing the 50 parking spaces.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7478.609s">but</a>  we have an entity that's used for public parking now being used as a business entity. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7485.472s">That's</a>  now going to be over, it's gonna be, because I'm a little confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7492.594s">It's</a>  gonna be, they're gonna be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7494.435s">So</a>  there'll be housed there. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7495.515s">So</a>  you'll have drivers coming in and out, taking those vehicles out of that location. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7501.137s">And,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7503.685s">then</a>  we don't know if they're going to be registered in Medford where there'd be tax in Medford and truly don't understand the impact or I know the traffic engineer isn't online, correct?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7516.774s">And</a>  sorry, I did just get clarification that we will be registering the vehicle taxes in city of Medford.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7523.258s">We</a>  did get- Off of vehicles?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7525.319s">That's</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7526.16s">Anything</a>  that would be operating in this market.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7528.889s">And</a>  then, you know, the traffic impact, I know that is one of the most densely populated areas that I know I traverse there every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7538.354s">And</a>  to see that adding another 50 more vehicles at a time is something that I have questions with. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7543.676s">So</a>  my personal opinion right now, until we get legal, I have, I get some legal questions that I need to ask, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7553.456s">an</a>  entity in the city that I can ask, which I don't, we don't have a solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7556.978s">We</a>  don't have a city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7558.239s">So</a>  I guess I'll have to call the mayor's office to see who can answer some of these questions legally. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7564.823s">I</a>  would recommend that we table this until we get further understanding of what this process is. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7570.047s">So</a>  that would be my recommendation, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7574.429s">That</a>  would be a motion to table.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7578.892s">Well,</a>  I'll delay that then if we have questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7581.394s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7584.242s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7585.523s">I'm</a>  somewhat familiar with flex car and flex hub. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7590.107s">One</a>  of the questions I have is this rental car is this going to be a rental car that's used for when they say drivers, you know, I keep thinking picturing driver like a Lyft driver in the Lyft driver works for Lyft and then they rent the vehicle through Lyft to use to provide the Lyft service to consumers. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7606.501s">Or</a>  is this where these are just going to be rental cars that <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7609.464s">The</a>  driver is me, and I want to rent the car and I can just go through flex lift to get the car. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7614.971s">Can</a>  she explain clarify that for me please. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7617.995s">Yeah,</a>  absolutely.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7618.977s">Yeah,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7619.778s">Thank</a>  you for the question so flex drive is a service for lift drivers so the lift drivers have to be on the platform. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7626.707s">in</a>  order to get this service from us. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7630.369s">So</a>  it is, and that's why I was stating it is by appointment only. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7634.91s">So</a>  it's not your regular traffic that you would get from a normal rental like Hertz, where you're going in and out and you've got a bunch of different people. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7642.793s">I</a>  mean, these are by appointment only and we have them scheduled. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7645.694s">So</a>  traffic wise, <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7647.835s">we</a>  wouldn't see an increase in traffic because our appointments, whether you're coming in for a technical support on the app, let's say, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7655.977s">Like</a>  somebody comes in, that's an appointment. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7658.097s">And</a>  then 30 minutes later, we might have another appointment, which is for the FlexDrive program. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7663.058s">So</a>  it's not increasing the amount of traffic that's coming into the space. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7667.079s">It's</a>  just adding an additional service to that program.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7672.722s">So</a>  ultimately it's somewhat like we have a post office over here and the post office has trucks and the employees of the post office use the trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7684.049s">And</a>  this is the same thing, the employees of Lyft would use the Lyft, the FlexLyft vehicles to perform the functions. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7690.555s">Now,</a>  that's assuming that they don't have cars, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7694.198s">Are</a>  they going to be authorized to park vehicles there all day while they take these FlexCars out? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7699.723s">Or</a>  are you saying that they're more long term than short term? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7703.166s">So</a>  I just, I think part of the concern that we're hearing from my colleague is that it's heavily congested. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7710.103s">heavily</a>  congested area. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7712.144s">And</a>  because of that, there are some public safety concerns that coupled with the fact that there's some issues with the garage. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7720.326s">The</a>  excise tax, I think, was a great question. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7722.026s">That</a>  makes a lot of sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7723.126s">The</a>  business is going to be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7724.087s">The</a>  vehicle should be garaged here so the city can offset the damages to our infrastructure with the funds that we generate. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7731.688s">But</a>  I certainly support the gentleman's motion to table the matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7736.41s">In</a>  fact, we need to go back to the table <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7740.535s">a</a>  little bit closer to an understanding of what this program is. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7745.137s">I</a>  personally have no problem with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7747.938s">I</a>  think it makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7748.739s">I</a>  would make some recommendations that, you know, the special permit go with the business and not with the address. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7755.221s">Do</a>  a 90 day review. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7756.962s">But</a>  as of right now, it doesn't feel as though <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7770.685s">I</a>  think Lift Hub has been a pretty good neighbor in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7776.607s">They've</a>  been pretty open with us when they came to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7780.109s">They</a>  let us know they were coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7781.529s">They</a>  invited us to come down. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7782.83s">They've</a>  always been visible and available to speak with anybody from government that has any concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7787.992s">So</a>  I certainly don't have an issue with their business model or the way they run their business, but the quality of life stuff and the neighborhood stuff do <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7801.748s">some</a>  of the entities that the larger businesses that are residential property. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7805.71s">So</a>  that stuff needs to be put into consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7811.032s">So</a>  I would second gentleman's motion to table it. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7816.095s">Should</a>  he reintroduce it in an effort for us to come to some common ground and see if we can figure this one out. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7822.498s">Because</a>  I think Lyft is a good employer to have here.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7825.079s">Thank</a>  you, councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7826.8s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7827.5s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7829.511s">I</a>  don't think most people even know that that Lyft office even exists there. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7833.352s">I</a>  think they've been there for probably close to five years now, if I'm not mistaken. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7837.653s">I</a>  remember going up there when it first opened. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7842.995s">So</a>  I'll disagree with my fellow councilors about the traffic impact over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7850.317s">The</a>  amount of people they have there going there during the day is minimal. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7855.258s">Most</a>  of their traffic have people going in there <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7857.692s">to</a>  going in there during those off hours of the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7860.813s">So</a>  my only concern is, I'm happy to hear that all those cars are gonna be registered. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7867.834s">So</a>  we get the excise tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7871.535s">My</a>  only concern is where those 80 cars are gonna be parked when you drop your car off to pick up the lift car. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7879.617s">So</a>  that's a question I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7881.337s">Are</a>  those people gonna be allowed to park in that garage? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7885.138s">Ma'am,</a>  would you know that?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7886.734s">So</a>  they will not be most drivers come with it don't have a vehicle so they normally get dropped off or will be getting a lift ride to the facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7895.823s">So</a>  there will be no parking driver parking or customer parking on site overnight parking.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7903.25s">So</a>  there will be no overnight parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7905.912s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7906.973s">In</a>  that garage with these people.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7911.401s">So</a>  just to clarify, no personal vehicle will be parked overnight in the parking garage.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7919.146s">There'll</a>  be no personal parking in that garage, correct?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7922.508s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7923.689s">And</a>  you're saying that all everyone that goes to pick up those 80 cars are being dropped off, correct?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7928.652s">That's</a>  correct.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7930.75s">Okay,</a>  and again, I don't have a problem supporting the show. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7933.812s">It</a>  does provide any more jobs for people with this new gig economy. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7940.618s">I'm</a>  familiar with Uber has a problem with Hertz. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7946.964s">It</a>  does the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7949.083s">And</a>  that's where those guys get their cars from. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7952.145s">So</a>  I don't have a problem supporting this as long as we're getting the excise taxes and those people are not parking their cars on any of our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7962.211s">And</a>  if they do leave their car, I would hope that they'll pay to park them in that garage there.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7970.954s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7971.955s">Councilor</a>  Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7974.116s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello and Councilor Unite have asked two of the questions I was gonna ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7979.939s">I</a>  think it would help me to get a sense of how many cars, because there are gonna be cars that are going out, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7989.624s">Being</a>  rented. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7991.585s">How</a>  many cars do you envision being in those spaces at a given time? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7995.527s">Just</a>  an average.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7998.369s">In</a>  the auxiliary parking?</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8000.53s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8001.876s">Um,</a>  it's hard to say, but our goal is I mean, obviously, our goal is always to not have any vehicles in those parking spaces, because that means that we are at a high utilization rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8012.326s">And</a>  again, being by appointment only, it's easy for us to keep our utilization rate down, because we are keeping track of who wants, you know, the next vehicle. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8021.575s">So</a>  we don't usually have overstock a vehicle sitting there for somebody to be able to come up and take that vehicle. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8028.1s">So</a>  I know that doesn't answer your question because it does fluctuate kind of depending on time of year. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8032.003s">But</a>  I mean, if I had to throw a number out there, I would say somewhere on the range of maybe 20 to 30 vehicles in the parking garage. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8040.55s">But</a>  again, that does fluctuate. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8042.412s">And</a>  hopefully it would be at zero.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8046.404s">Okay,</a>  thank you for the answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8048.725s">I</a>  think one benefit that hasn't been talked about is that this would lower the need, like people's, Lyft drivers need to buy vehicles, which means that, you know, that's better for parking in general in the area, in the greater Boston area, better for the environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8070.38s">But</a>  of course we have these other considerations that we have to think about as well.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8076.743s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8077.644s">Any</a>  further comments from members of the Council? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8079.305s">I</a>  have a couple questions myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8085.351s">Just</a>  so I get this right, is FlexDrive Services LLC owned by Lyft?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8090.917s">It's</a>  a subsidiary.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8092.758s">Is</a>  it a wholly owned subsidiary? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8096.24s">Yes,</a>  so my question here relates to the business model. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8102.824s">You</a>  mentioned onboarding of drivers. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8106.205s">Are</a>  drivers employees of Lyft or FlexDrive Services LLC?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8112.969s">Can</a>  you repeat that question one more time?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8115.21s">Are</a>  the Lyft drivers you discussed, are they employees either of FlexDrive Services LLC or employees of Lyft as a corporation?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8124.455s">They</a>  are... <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8128.198s">Well,</a>  they're not, they're on the platform. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8130.9s">They're</a>  utilizing the platform.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8133.721s">They're</a>  independent contractors.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8135.762s">Independent</a>  contractor utilizing the platform.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8139.024s">Is</a>  there any guarantee that if a contractor, I mean, I just have some serious questions here. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8144.187s">You're</a>  giving them the platform and you're renting them the car, but there's no guarantee they make the minimum wage. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8150.49s">Is</a>  that correct?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8152.452s">I</a>  can't really speak to that.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8155.623s">That's</a>  a yes or no question. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8157.244s">It</a>  depends on how many hours they work. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8158.465s">Give</a>  me a car and a job.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8162.227s">If</a>  they work the hours, they can make the money, right?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8163.968s">Okay,</a>  let me rephrase this. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8164.909s">What</a>  happens if a Lyft driver rents the car, but is unable to make the payment for the rental for whatever reason, because the income isn't enough from the app?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8174.535s">Well,</a>  the vehicle, just to clarify, so the vehicle can be used for also personal driving. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8180.679s">So</a>  if somebody wants to utilize it <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8183.177s">you</a>  know, for obviously their own personal reasons, or if they want to utilize it to be on, you know, like, let's say a different food service provider, they can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8193.661s">So</a>  they can rent from us and be able to use the vehicle for any other uses.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8200.164s">What,</a>  you know, in terms of rental, do they pay a flat fee? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8203.225s">Do</a>  they pay by the mile? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8205.786s">Is</a>  it more competitive or less competitive than say, renting a car from Hertz?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8212.083s">There</a>  are benefits. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8212.964s">The</a>  more that the driver drives on the platform, there are benefits to the amount of hours that they're working on the platform.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8222.87s">But</a>  I guess my question is, if they rent from you, is it cheaper than if they just rent it from any old rental company?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8230.595s">That</a>  is the goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8232.116s">That</a>  is correct.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8233.878s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8235.299s">Well,</a>  I'll just leave my questions there. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8237.48s">I</a>  have, again, some serious qualms about this kind <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8242.188s">Um,</a>  any further comments by members of the council Councilor Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8249.11s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8249.69s">Yeah,</a>  I appreciate the petitioner being before us tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8252.131s">I</a>  appreciate the motion to table as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8253.971s">I</a>  think this is a matter I'd want to give some additional consideration to. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8257.932s">I</a>  think that the point is well noted that this, um, company or its subsidiary already exists in Medford and there haven't been <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8264.555s">grave</a>  consequences noted that they've been a pretty good neighbor in the business community. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8270.304s">But</a>  I think for myself, you know, it's hard for me as a representative to <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8279.891s">further</a>  enmesh, you know, the subcontractor based economy in our community, knowing that there's no way of regulating, you know, if these are competitive with living wages, if these are, you know, as good of jobs as our local residents really deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8293.862s">So</a>  that's not at all a reflection on the petitioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8295.823s">here</a>  before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8296.443s">I</a>  really appreciate the work you've put into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8298.944s">It's</a>  something I want to give more thought to. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8301.726s">I</a>  think it's the issue of, you know, the day-to-day, the traffic impact, the impact on this specific neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8307.768s">And</a>  in addition, you know, what type of businesses do we want to be making up our business ecosystem here in our community? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8314.711s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8315.932s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8316.752s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8317.812s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8318.973s">Let</a>  it be known that City of Bedford derives money <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8323.847s">from</a>  every ride share service that originates here. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8327.449s">And</a>  I think if we look back, see how much money is, how many rides start here, it's a decent sum of money that we receive really doing nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8341.736s">I</a>  know Boston gets more than we do, but we do derive money from every ride share service that originates in the city of Medford.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8351.181s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8352.081s">Any</a>  further comments?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8353.486s">I</a>  just have a couple of more questions to a friend of sunny California might not be sunny there anymore at 630. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8360.369s">But</a>  what are the requirements to be a Lyft driver in Massachusetts, where you need a driver's license in a vehicle right.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8373.395s">I</a>  apologize I was on mute.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8381.535s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8383.097s">Yes,</a>  that is correct.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8384.999s">Okay,</a>  and if I have a driver's license, but I don't have a vehicle, can I be a Lyft driver?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8392.188s">Yes,</a>  if you buy in on the program, if you you can rent a vehicle from us, and then yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8398.075s">So</a>  it does give business to <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8401.708s">to</a>  individuals who are unfortunate don't have a vehicle. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8404.751s">And</a>  this allows someone to be able to start earnings or start creating earnings based off of being able to rent a vehicle from us.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8413.039s">Excellent,</a>  excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8413.679s">So</a>  ultimately, this also gives people who don't have the <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8418.809s">driver's</a>  license, the opportunity to get a job and work.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8421.051s">That's</a>  correct.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8422.633s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8423.154s">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8423.394s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8424.695s">I</a>  would again suggest so I there's no one else to speak.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8428.72s">I</a>  think the important piece right now is very is twofold. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8433.024s">The</a>  understanding of getting some questions answered and making sure this council at one point wasn't represented <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8441.853s">when</a>  there was a special permit requested by a legal team, and when we denied it for a reason that we couldn't, we were then sued. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8450.696s">So</a>  the reason why I want to make sure that we don't do anything until we get the word from legal that one way or the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8460.718s">So</a>  I know I appreciate the representative from Lyft. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8463.919s">It's</a>  a lot of great questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8467.555s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello brings up some great points. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8469.315s">I</a>  understand the benefit for taxable revenue through the excise tax, but I just want to make sure there are some questions that I have legally on our end before.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8484.879s">My</a>  recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8488.5s">May</a>  I take public participation? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8489.981s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8491.281s">Take</a>  public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8493.762s">Please</a>  give your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[William Navarre]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8495.665s">William</a>  Navarre, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8498.447s">I</a>  just had a question for the representative. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8502.13s">If</a>  a driver participates in this program, does this lock the bid to use Lyft as a driver only and they're not allowed to use Uber, their own ride for hire business card or whatever? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8514.959s">Are</a>  they required to be sort of exclusively with Lyft? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8520.103s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8520.383s">So</a>  to answer that question, it is not exclusive to Lyft. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8527.883s">they</a>  can use it for personal or any other service that they would like.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8533.344s">So</a>  my recommendation would be that now that I have these questions that I can, I would table for two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8539.565s">And</a>  hopefully the city administration can have someone through the legal team just answer a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8545.667s">I'll</a>  reach out to them tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8547.087s">So</a>  my recommendation right now I don't feel comfortable to go to a vote with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8550.448s">So</a>  it has to table for two weeks.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8552.108s">Motion</a>  to table for two weeks by Councilor Scarpelli, pending legal review. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8556.911s">Would</a>  you be comfortable amending that to request that legal counsel be present at our meeting in two weeks? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8560.474s">If</a>  they could, that'd be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8561.655s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8561.895s">So</a>  on the motion to table for two weeks and request that legal counsel be present at our next meeting, seconded by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8568.439s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8570.141s">Opposed?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8571.281s">Motion</a>  passes to table. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8573.543s">Can</a>  we also make the same motion relative to paper 22-538? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8576.985s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8580.067s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Knight to table 22-538 for two weeks seconded by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8585.67s">All</a>  those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8587.291s">Opposed.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8588.652s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8589.733s">What</a>  was our next one? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8597.838s">540.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8597.858s">22-540</a>  to President Morell and honorable members of the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8603.007s">from</a>  mayor brand Lungo-Koehn re food truck permit for Medford Square meter project celebration date, October 5th, 2022 on behalf of the below entity, I respectfully submit the following requests for food truck permit in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8615.717s">In</a>  addition to city council approval vendors are required to adhere to health department food safety requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8619.4s">One</a>  Zach's ice cream truck, not mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8621.341s">Date</a>  and time Thursday, October 20th, 2022, 12 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8625.544s">to</a>  3 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8627.005s">location,</a>  Medford city hall parking lot looks like <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8630.428s">the</a>  West Rear parking lot event celebration of the completion of the Medford Square meter project about the event on Thursday, October 20th, 2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8638.894s">The</a>  parking department will host an event to celebrate the completion of the installation of new meters throughout Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8645.579s">Thank</a>  you for your attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8646.42s">This</a>  matter sincerely.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8893.032s">I</a>  mean, this is like the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard in my life.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8896.402s">Yeah,</a>  I know we're making light of this, but I'm gonna be honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8900.745s">In</a>  all seriousness, this is disappointing. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8905.268s">I</a>  know we're joking and laughing about it, but are you kidding me? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8908.25s">I</a>  had teachers call me today because they're working to rule. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8912.312s">Now</a>  that's not good for both ends. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8916.355s">You</a>  have kids that are not gonna be given the services they need because teachers are that frustrated that they're not working to rule, so when 230 hits, they're home. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8926.008s">And</a>  I understand that this is funny, but this is funny disgusting. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8932.516s">Let's</a>  have an ice cream truck unveil, celebrate something we just talked about that's turning the city upside down. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8941.126s">We've</a>  had nothing but complaints and anger. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8946.096s">You</a>  know what, if the director will come here for four hours to discuss issues, I will vote on an ice cream truck to be parked right out here. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8953.238s">As</a>  long as someone's right there answering the questions that I have to answer every night. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8957.759s">I'm</a>  disgusted.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8960.4s">I</a>  apologize.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8963.161s">This</a>  is something, I love this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8965.501s">I</a>  love the city, but this is becoming a laughing stock. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8968.782s">This</a>  is a joke asking for ice cream. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8973.473s">So</a>  my vote to be no, I would deny this permit.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8978.374s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Schell.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8979.314s">Councilor</a>  Collins, Councilor Smith.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8982.775s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8983.815s">I</a>  was waffling back and forth on how to vote on this motion now that it's before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8995.617s">And</a>  I had been thinking, just to speak candidly, I mentioned earlier, I think that, <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9003.015s">We're</a>  all acutely aware of the many problems with the parking department and the ways that that's manifested into the lives of our residents and business owners into the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9015.207s">And</a>  I also think that some of the ways in which that flack has been levied upon the parking department to the exclusion of higher ups in the city administration is not quite fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9024.377s">So</a>  I have been thinking, <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9027.113s">you</a>  know, why spread the grief around? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9029.354s">I</a>  know from talking to staff in the parking department that as flawed and fraught as this parking meter repair project has been, you know, it was a lot of work to repair kiosks that had been broken and in disrepair because of Reef Republic for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9047.04s">Why</a>  not let them, you know, why not say yes to something immaterial? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9052.622s">However,</a>  the more I think about it, <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9057.96s">you</a>  know, everybody in the city works really hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9060.601s">I</a>  think that everybody who works in City Hall deserves an ice cream social for their efforts. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9065.224s">But</a>  I think that but please let me finish. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9068.326s">Please</a>  let me finish. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9069.526s">I</a>  think that if we're talking about giving staff what they're due for their hard work, what I'd really like to see for the parking department is a bargained contract, you know, the recognition of their union. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9080.427s">I</a>  think that what these staff members deserve, because regardless of the outcome, we know that they're working hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9085.131s">What</a>  they deserve is not an ice cream social. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9088.253s">What</a>  they deserve is fair bargaining with this administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9092.076s">You</a>  know, this is the chain of thought that's changed my mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9094.418s">I</a>  don't want to keep more grief upon an embattled department, as flawed as it may be, but this isn't what they deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9100.983s">You</a>  know, parking is not what we deserve, but this isn't the reward that they deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9104.886s">What</a>  they deserve is fair working conditions, not a, <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9111.268s">a</a>  little pool party. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9113.112s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9113.813s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9116.178s">I</a>  think we might be used to things like this, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9122.575s">feeling</a>  like there is going to receive a rubber stamp approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9125.736s">Moving</a>  on, I mean it's clear from the conversation tonight it's not but I do think it's important to go back to the reason why we have these special events and celebrations, which is that, you know, we want to unite the city and we want to bring vibrancy, but the problem is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9141.423s">meter</a>  project is an embellished project that doesn't necessarily unite our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9147.087s">And,</a>  you know, a simple celebration like this isn't necessarily going to improve vibrancy that much, unlike Oktoberfest, which this weekend brought together, I think, residents of all different backgrounds and gave families a place to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9166.079s">My</a>  second concern with the project, or with the special events <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9170.222s">like</a>  this is that it's Panama and Kyrgyzstan, which is bread and circuses, you know, we buy by, you know, by having these celebrations, I think it's really easy to mask the problems that exist here in City Hall, the problems that exist with our policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9188.144s">and</a>  the problems with how we treat workers. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9191.545s">And,</a>  you know, I think it's really important that we use this platform and that we say, you know, we can't keep masking our problems with city celebrations and press releases. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9200.428s">We</a>  need to actually tackle these really hard hitting issues head on to have that maturity of the leadership to do that.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9212.657s">It's</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9213.317s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9213.717s">Councilor</a>  Tseng that was great. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9215.838s">Hey,</a>  well, and I just want to say one thing that petition sincerely brand a local current mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9221.239s">This</a>  is submitted to us by the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9224.04s">Either</a>  no thought went into it, or this is before us because they wanted us to have a fight where then the parking department's mad at us because we didn't throw them an ice cream party. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9234.507s">You</a>  don't have to have a food truck to have an ice cream party. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9236.669s">You</a>  don't, you know, if you want to have an internal celebration in your department for the work that you're doing, you don't have to come to this council to ask us for permission to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9243.655s">So</a>  either no thought went into it, or this isn't intentionally before us to make us have this conversation that we don't want to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9250.921s">I</a>  mean, and I don't know which one's worse to be honest.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9253.804s">Or</a>  alternative, or alternatively, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9255.465s">It's</a>  for, it's for, it's to create a pseudo, <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9259.108s">look</a>  that there is support for this field right program right so that you can put it in a press release like Justin said right so we have pictures but look at the pictures it was an ice cream social and everybody had a great time right anytime the going gets tough there's a ribbon cutting have we seen that trend anytime the going gets tough there's a ribbon cutting I'm just saying if the goal there's a lot of ways to go about it that don't require this process</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9283.292s">And</a>  I don't disagree with what everyone else said.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9285.673s">At</a>  least use a local company. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9288.175s">We</a>  have local vendors here who get hit up all the time for donations and everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9294.758s">And</a>  here we are, you've got some money to spend and you're spending it outside of the city of Bedford. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=9300.248s">We</a>  don't even know that.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10216.597s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Bears for putting this on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10219.839s">This</a>  is something that we discussed lately in our last meeting with the parking department. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10226.062s">You</a>  know, there's, we heard potentially that there was breach of contract and, you know, I mean, I think you've already explained it. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10234.526s">I</a>  just want to make sure that the city administration really does take this item particularly seriously because <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10243.138s">you</a>  know, we as a city can't let things like this go on, you know, unaddressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10251.925s">But</a>  you know, we also have other items that we've asked to be explained in executive session that we haven't had come back to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10258.97s">And</a>  so I just wanted to mark my disappointment on that and hope that this item is different.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10267.105s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10267.445s">I</a>  appreciate you putting this forward tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10269.848s">I'm</a>  glad to support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10270.989s">And</a>  I think related to this, I want to note that I think on some of our previous meetings, if I seem oddly sympathetic to the parking department, when there's a lot of justifiable... <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10280.99s">I</a>  think there's been a lot of, um, angst going around because of you know how how that work is going so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10285.991s">I</a>  think a lot of that is lodged in what I heard about the condition that the parking department was left in by reef technology at the outset of director Morrison's tenure in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10297.834s">Um</a>  from various people within that department. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10300.795s">I</a>  have really very grave <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10311.4s">revenue</a>  that was who knows how amount and who knows how much of that actually ended up in the city of Medford protocols that seemed <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10320.415s">Um,</a>  just just deeply, deeply far from best practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10323.217s">And</a>  that, you know, does trace back to our city's mount on a blind, both in terms of what we were being compensated when brief was doing this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10330.162s">If</a>  it was fair, if we even have a yardstick for how close to fair it was, um, and how that contributed to the high mountain that we now have to climb to get to a good place with parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10339.168s">Um,</a>  so I'm very interested in seeing this investigated. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10341.47s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10342.317s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10346.879s">I</a>  do support the intent of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10351.32s">Where</a>  we don't have any hosts in, we don't have our own council. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10356.722s">I</a>  hate to be throwing more good money after bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10361.104s">And</a>  I agree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10364.105s">It</a>  warrants a conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10365.886s">See</a>  if there is a breach, but if, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10370.639s">If</a>  KP Law is going to charge us $100,000 to collect $50,000, I don't want to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10377.663s">I</a>  hear you. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10378.883s">I</a>  hate to be wasting more money on something that's in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10386.507s">They</a>  did whatever they did. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10388.508s">I</a>  don't know if they did a breach of contract, but before this goes any further, I would just <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10396.674s">I</a>  want to see some kind of indication that there is some kind of breach of contract or anything because I just don't want to spend another $100,000 chasing something we're not going to get.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10406.016s">And</a>  I hear you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10406.676s">I</a>  mean, that's what I'm concerned about.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10408.996s">Director</a>  Morrison said at a minimum $150,000 was her estimate of the minimum of what damages they left us with. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10417.097s">She</a>  went to apparently and I think she said it in the meeting to the mayor and KP law or to the chief of staff and KP law and said, I think we should go after them because $150,000 is not nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10426.371s">And</a>  then KP Law said, I believe the direct quote from Director Morrison was, it's not worth it. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10431.695s">Not</a>  worth it to who? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10433.216s">And</a>  that represents the fundamental conflict of KP Law. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10436.198s">It</a>  may not be worth it at KP Law rates, but it's worth it to the city if we have a city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10441.742s">And</a>  that's part of what I'm getting at here. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10443.203s">If</a>  we're saying it's not worth it, but that determination is being made because an outside lawyer is charging the city more than we would, you know, then that's not in the interest of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10453.45s">That's</a>  in the interest of, <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10455.051s">the</a>  bill for KP law and that means that we're not getting the legal representation that we need.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10459.296s">KP</a>  law is famous for padding the bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10461.578s">That's</a>  their memo with other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10463.7s">I'm</a>  just saying, that's what my concern is. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10465.402s">Uh,</a>  you know, if we had an in-house legal counsel could probably give you a pretty simple answer, but you know, to have them go out and charge us $500, $1,000 an hour to come back and say, you're not going to get anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10478.782s">I</a>  just I just don't want to throw away that the city is throwing away hundreds of thousands of dollars only on poor legal advice.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10487.226s">I</a>  would be happy to amend it to say that the mayor and city solicitor when hired.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10493.068s">Yeah,</a>  fine.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10493.808s">I</a>  just don't want to give people already more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10498.31s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10505.222s">Does</a>  anybody ever notice that anytime anything goes wrong in the parking department, it's always somebody else's fault and not the parking department's? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10515.106s">Or</a>  is it just me picking that up?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10520.268s">When</a>  the person who's supposed to be responsible won't take responsibility, what do you, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10527.09s">And</a>  I'm just saying, the person who decided to do this this fast and then brought someone on it to give them the resources to do it, <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10535.235s">is</a>  the mayor, and then she puts them out here to take the heat for the decisions that the mayor made. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10540.737s">And</a>  now I'm editorializing from the chair, which I will stop doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10546.759s">On</a>  the motion on, is there a motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10550.18s">Motion</a>  to approve as amended by Councilor Seconded by Councilor Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10554.822s">And</a>  here's the amendment if you need it.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10570.03s">I'm</a>  going to withdraw this motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10571.25s">I</a>  think we better take it up closer to election day.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10573.492s">Withdrawn.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10574.113s">22-536</a>  offered by Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10577.035s">Be</a>  it so resolved that the City Council asks the City Administration to reach out to residents about the Affordable Connectivity Program, which provides eligible households $30 per month off their internet bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10585.661s">ACP</a>  eligible households can also receive a one-time discount of up to $100 to purchase a laptop, desktop, computer, or tablet from participating providers. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10592.566s">Councilor</a>  Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10594.586s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10596.568s">The</a>  Affordable Connectivity Program is something that was passed in the bipartisan infrastructure law, which could really help families in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10607.875s">The</a>  $30 per month off internet bills and $100 discount is something that means a lot to families, especially when electricity prices going up and there's inflation when it comes to everyday bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10623.324s">The</a>  discount to purchase a laptop, computer, or tablet is also something that could help students who are more disadvantaged in our school system, help people find jobs, help people at work. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10636.513s">And</a>  so I think this is a particularly valuable thing that our city should be reaching out to residents about, making sure that they qualify. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10642.997s">And</a>  there's a whole list of people who qualify. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10646.399s">One</a>  of the <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10649.0s">categories</a>  I can pull up out of my mind right now is if you're if you're receiving staff benefits but I think you know this <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10659.083s">Resolution</a>  also goes to show that we need a better outreach and better communications policy from the city government. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10666.827s">And</a>  this is one of those situations where it'd be great to have a communications department. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10675.492s">But</a>  perhaps in the meantime, we could have our community liaisons and Office of Outreach and Prevention take the lead as well as some other relevant city departments.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10686.818s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor say any further comments point information kind of concepts, if you can explain this a little bit more detailed at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10693.102s">So</a>  this would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10693.742s">This</a>  would be $30 household per month for internet and bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10700.666s">Yeah,</a>  this is coming through what what program is that it's a federal program. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10705.469s">What</a>  is it, it's a federal program. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10706.789s">Okay,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10708.676s">That's</a>  amazing, I didn't realize that.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10709.997s">So</a>  that's... Yeah, I didn't know about it until I came across it on Twitter one day. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10714.579s">And</a>  if you're not on Twitter, you might not find out.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10718.92s">This</a>  should be something that, again, this is where you should be standing on top of mountains. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10724.383s">Imagine</a>  parents understanding the difficulties they're having with Wi-Fi connections, because affordability, there's a process that we can do that on the federal side. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10735.423s">It's</a>  disheartening but appreciate your hard work and finding that that's a, I would second your resolution.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10742.746s">And</a>  the motion of Councilor Tseng, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10746.068s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10747.028s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10747.868s">Opposed?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10748.469s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10749.329s">I</a>  will not support the next one. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10751.17s">No?</a> </p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10751.75s">Well,</a>  if we challenge it.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10753.831s">This</a>  protects you from discrimination. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10757.553s">I</a>  will not support anything that has to do with it.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10763.72s">22-537</a>  offered by Councilor Tseng whereas chapter 117 of the acts of 2022 entitled quote an act prohibiting discrimination based upon natural and protective hairstyles also referred to as the crown act which takes effect on october 24th 2022 prohibits discrimination against individuals in workplaces school associations and places of public accommodation based on quote traits that historically associated with race be it so resolved that the city council asked the city administration <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10790.098s">to</a>  review their equal employment opportunity and or anti discrimination policies as well as any other policies or codes that may limit or interfere with an employee's ability to wear natural and protective hairstyles update the council on review.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10800.066s">Thank</a>  you vice president bears for reading all that. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10804.749s">Um,</a>  this is a law that was passed by our state legislature and that's now law in our state. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10812.619s">And</a>  it's going into effect pretty soon in about two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10816.822s">Um,</a>  we need to make sure that we as a city are not in breach of this, um, you know, to save us legal trouble but also to make sure that everything is fair in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10827.567s">Again,</a>  this goes to show we need a city solicitor solicitor we need an assistant city solicitor we need people who can review our policies and make sure that that state law, we're not interfering with state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10838.796s">And,</a>  yeah, and I would appreciate if the city administration will send us a report about and keep us updated about what's happening.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10845.461s">Mr.</a>  President, I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10849.808s">my</a>  colleague bringing this forward, I think that this, I believe, was a huge issue in the local school department that then left that school department in financial resolve because of that situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10865.411s">So</a>  it's good to see if we bring that forward, making sure that our school superintendent and school department and the governing body there that makes decisions also are informed of <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10878.903s">this,</a>  this very important situation because we don't want to be viable. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10884.108s">So,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10885.189s">And</a>  we said I would second that.</p>
