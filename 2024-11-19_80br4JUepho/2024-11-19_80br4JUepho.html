    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=152.346s">Councilor</a>  Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=153.386s">Motion</a>  to take paper 2245, 452 out of, 542, sorry, out of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=160.348s">We</a>  have a few people in the audience here to speak on the paper.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=171.866s">That's</a>  what I'm seeking?</p>

    <p>[Elections Manager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=212.132s">Hi,</a>  I'm Melissa Ripley. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=213.273s">I</a>  live at 27 being terrorist in Melrose. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=216.661s">Thank</a>  you for having me, letting me come in here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=219.383s">Very</a>  excited to be here as the elections manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=222.526s">Today</a>  before you, I would like to ask you to approve the warrant for the 2020 state election, which is November 8th. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=229.131s">The</a>  elect, the paperwork in your packet shows the words and precincts that are available for the voters this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=235.296s">It</a>  also gives a synopsis of all the things that will be on the ballot.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=243.169s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=246.451s">Just</a>  to confirm a couple of things, I think most folks by now are familiar that there's going to be four ballot questions statewide, which we'll be considering, but I also noticed that there were two ballot questions here that are non-binding that are local ballot questions, questions five and six. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=264.259s">I</a>  just wanted to confirm that questions five and six will be on the ballot in <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=270.09s">Uh,</a>  are they in every district or they're not in every district? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=272.951s">Could</a>  you tell us?</p>

    <p>[Elections Manager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=273.532s">They're</a>  only in two districts.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=275.033s">Could</a>  you say which ones there?</p>

    <p>[Elections Manager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=276.413s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=276.853s">Let</a>  me just pull it open here so I can show you. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=279.295s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=284.597s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=284.937s">Question</a>  five. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=285.858s">This</a>  question is not binding. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=287.839s">It</a>  is in Ward one precinct one and two Ward two precinct one and two Ward three precinct one and two. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=296.956s">Ward</a>  4, Precinct 1, and Precinct 2.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=299.318s">Is</a>  this just the State Reps District? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=301.419s">Which</a>  one? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=302.7s">The</a>  34th? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=303.28s">This</a>  looks like all of them.</p>

    <p>[Elections Manager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=305.662s">So</a>  number 5 is all. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=307.183s">Number</a>  6 is limited to the wards and precincts. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=311.165s">So</a>  as you can see, the different wards and precincts are a little different.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=315.768s">So</a>  that would be in the Barber District and the Donato District?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=320.471s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=321.392s">OK,</a>  so question 6 is just not on the ballot in the Garbally District.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=324.763s">correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=325.263s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=326.104s">And</a>  then could you just let if you have it available, let folks know when early voting is going to be available and where it will be available.</p>

    <p>[Elections Manager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=333.89s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=334.15s">We're</a>  still working on the early voting, but the early voting is required by the state to be October 2nd through November 4th. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=340.735s">It</a>  is likely the early voting will be here on the weekends. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=343.898s">We</a>  are required to do six hours each weekend day for early voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=347.781s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=348.385s">probably</a>  8 32 30 on both Saturdays and Sundays. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=352.25s">The</a>  last day to register to vote will be October 29th. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=356.255s">The</a>  office will be open until five o'clock for people to register to vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=359.579s">However,</a>  early voting will only be 8 32 30 that day. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=363.538s">During</a>  the week, early voting is available during regular business hours of City Hall.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=368.043s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=368.444s">And</a>  then my last question is on mail balloting. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=370.987s">I</a>  know it's a little different for the general versus the primary. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=373.911s">So</a>  for the general, if I'm correct, and correct me if I'm wrong, ballots will be accepted as long as they're postmarked by Election Day.</p>

    <p>[Elections Manager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=381.86s">Yes,</a>  they will be as they will be accepted as long as they're postmarked by Election Day, and they need to be here within a certain time timeframe after the election, so we can allow for counting.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=392.392s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=393.973s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Elections Manager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=394.854s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=396.636s">Second,</a>  Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Elections Manager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=397.197s">That's</a>  what I was just saying.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=399.139s">Just</a>  to clarify, by Election Day, does that include Election Day for the viewers who are watching?</p>

    <p>[Elections Manager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=403.957s">Yes,</a>  so it needs to be postmarked by the election day. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=408.458s">And</a>  if it's not a mail-in ballot, it needs to be here by 8 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=412.819s">Otherwise,</a>  we have a couple of days after, so we can count those ballots and receive them.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=416.979s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=417.599s">Thank</a>  you for the discussion from councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=421.28s">On</a>  that motion to approve from Councilor Knight, I second it by vicers and bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=426.521s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=427.701s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=428.381s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=429.201s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=430.182s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=431.422s">Thank</a>  you both.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=433.384s">Senate</a>  President motion to revert to the regular order of business.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=435.925s">On</a>  the motion of Vice President Bears to revert to the regular order of business as seconded by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=440.427s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=441.448s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=441.668s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=444.589s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=445.51s">22-521</a>  offered by Vice President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=447.271s">Be</a>  it resolved by the Medford City Council that we celebrate Italian Heritage Month this October and recognize the massive contributions Italian and Italian American people have made to Medford, our country and the world, as well as the rich cultural diversity, history, and vibrancy our city owes to the Italian American community.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=464.696s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=465.817s">I</a>  think the resolution is relatively self-explanatory, but this is Italian Heritage Month, and it's obviously a time to celebrate the contributions of Italian and Italian-American people to our city here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=483.893s">As</a>  we know, Medford for a long time has had a vibrant <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=488.197s">Italian</a>  community, a place for immigrants from Italy to come here, and then for many generations to raise families, and we can see the impact in our business community, government, culture, everywhere in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=500.548s">And</a>  I think it's a great time to recognize Italian Heritage Month. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=505.332s">So</a>  I would motion to approve and to join with Councilor Tseng's paper 22-525. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=509.076s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=511.518s">Going</a>  to Councilor Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=513.169s">Thank</a>  you, I would second that motion, first of all. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=517.332s">In</a>  prepping for tonight, I thought of a conversation I had with one of my college mentors, who was a proud Italian American, and he knows Taiwanese culture really well, so my family background. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=528.9s">And</a>  we had a long talk about the values that we share in common, which are family, community, hard work, amongst other values. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=538.286s">And</a>  in Medford, we're extremely fortunate for the rich involvement of Italian Americans in building our city from, as Vice President Bears has stated, from teaching to public safety, work like plumbing and healthcare, public service and beyond. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=554.314s">I</a>  just wanted to say I really appreciate that here in Medford I grew up learning about Italian culture, learning the language, learning about Italian foods, and being able to do my little diorama of Galileo's project, which is something I've come to realize outside of Medford is not such a common experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=574.25s">And</a>  I think Medford's past and present proves that these values, family, community, public service, hard work, they are fundamental to who we are as a city, and that the contributions of this community, of the Italian American community, have really shaped who we are, and that they prove that this is larger than any one person. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=594.894s">It's</a>  really about our community as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=597.834s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=598.354s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=600.294s">Any</a>  further discussion from the Council?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=603.822s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=604.642s">I</a>  do believe, oh, it must be about a year and a half ago now, this council passed a measure and we sent it to the administration and shocker, never got a response. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=612.965s">But</a>  what we asked for was the administration to analyze the feasibility of creating an Italian-American cultural district in South Medford to commemorate the contributions of many of our Italian-American residents here. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=627.909s">When</a>  you think about people like <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=633.1s">Ernesto</a>  Martini, Alfredo Russo, and the likes, people that really made a big difference in this community over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=640.585s">We've</a>  asked the administration to look into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=644.443s">Year</a>  and a half might have gone by now, and we still haven't received anything from it, from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=649.408s">So</a>  I know it's only been a year and a half, and it's usually about three years before we get something back from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=654.793s">But</a>  I'm hoping that maybe we can put a reminder into the administration as maybe a B paper or as an amendment to this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=661.078s">I'm</a>  asking for an update from the administration on the feasibility of creating an Italian American cultural district as passed by the council previously.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=669.547s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=670.207s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=671.208s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=672.349s">President,</a>  I just want to thank my two councillors for putting this on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=676.932s">I'm</a>  very proud to be an Italian member of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=680.435s">Both</a>  of my parents are Italian American, my grandparents are. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=685.278s">And</a>  again, I'm glad we're going to recognize the <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=692.185s">all</a>  the things that Italian Americans have done in this community over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=694.987s">So</a>  I stand with Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=697.188s">I</a>  mean, I think I was a co-sponsor of that with him, to have something to recognize the Italian community, but as we see, nothing ever came of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=707.755s">But</a>  I just want to thank my two councilors for putting it on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=710.737s">Took</a>  a little bit of heat from the public, because the two Italian guys didn't put it on.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=716.52s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=717.481s">Any</a>  further discussion from the council?</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=721.333s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=721.673s">Thank</a>  you for my fellow counsel putting this forward as a first generation American who has a very deep and proud tradition of our Italian culture. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=731.063s">I</a>  appreciate bringing this forward, but I will tell you to say that the Italian American community isn't <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=740.063s">is</a>  still a little unhappy in our community, not because of a name change of a school, but because of the discussions of not following through with really celebrating an Italian American and making sure that our community wasn't forgotten. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=759.446s">It's</a>  something that I appreciate my colleagues bringing this resolution forward so we can mention it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=765.03s">I</a>  appreciate Councilor Knight and Councilor Caraviello for that initiative they did put through a year and a half ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=770.754s">But</a>  again, I guess if it's not forefront in the news, it's really not a true issue in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=777.159s">So</a>  it's disheartening for Councilor Caraviello <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=784.162s">person</a>  like myself that parents came to this country from Italy to make make their their roots to settle their roots and look at follow the American dream. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=795.774s">And</a>  and Medford has done that for sure for my family. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=800.499s">We're</a>  very fortunate that my mom and dad have now passed on but left us. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=807.513s">We</a>  leave them at the thanks of everything they've done for us and how they taught us to work hard and really have pride in who we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=816.716s">And</a>  I think that, I just hope this community and this administration follows through what they're saying and what we talked about just a few short years ago, because it seems like it's a culture that is easily forgotten where one time <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=836.238s">the</a>  Italian culture and the Irish culture in this community built it for what it is today. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=840.302s">Why</a>  so many people love this great city. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=841.984s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=846.495s">Um,</a>  I just, I just wanted to thank Councilor Knight for the bee papers. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=851.976s">Um,</a>  that's that's an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=853.517s">That's</a>  an initiative that I, I would support. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=856.757s">Um,</a>  I actually, about two years ago, I was in San Diego, which has its little, little Italy. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=864.679s">I'm</a>  sure President Morello is familiar. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=869.719s">I</a>  was actually very touched by, they had signs on the roads, on lampposts, talking about different Italian-Americans and their contributions to both San Diego and to the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=883.108s">And</a>  it'd be very nice if we could have something like that here in Medford, celebrating the contributions of Italian-Americans to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=891.434s">Perhaps</a>  something even more local, more Medford-based, since we have such a rich Italian-American history here. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=897.538s">Um,</a>  but again, I support that idea.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=900.0s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng any further discussion from the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=903.963s">Mr.</a>  Yeah, it's a big paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=905.884s">I</a>  just see Mr. Castagnetti is rare to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=908.846s">Name</a>  and address for record, please.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=914.25s">Andrew</a>  Castagnetti, Christian Street Method Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=917.332s">I</a>  want to thank the council for bringing celebrating the Italian Heritage Month. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=924.217s">And</a>  I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=927.156s">In</a>  my opinion, I might be a bit biased, but Italy, the Italian people's probably the greatest contributors to the world worldwide. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=935.52s">And</a>  they'll live in worldwide too. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=938.081s">From</a>  the depression days when they had to get out of the country because they couldn't feed themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=944.584s">A</a>  few examples of their great leaders would be Da Vinci, Michelangelo, Ferdinand, Galileo, Marconi. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=956.069s">It</a>  goes on and on. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=958.2s">Miracle</a>  versus Gucci and we're named after that as the Americas. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=962.463s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=966.065s">And</a>  Italian cuisine, as a matter of fact, where my folks come from, I'm not first generation, I'm half generation. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=973.129s">I</a>  was born in Cambridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=974.93s">I</a>  didn't speak English until I started kindergarten. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=977.272s">I</a>  spoke another Italian dialect, one of thousands with all the mountains from the Alps down to the boot heel. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=987.289s">The</a>  first gastronomical university in all of Europe was in Bologna, Italy, which is near Venice and Milano. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1000.117s">And</a>  to a lot of us, Italo-Americans, the greatest of them all was the most courageous explorer of all time. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1015.875s">Cristoforo</a>  Colombo, who said that the world was not flat, he would not fall off it, and he would get to the other side, but he was blocked by a couple of continents in the central, which became America. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1034.706s">Imagine</a>  the courage on this guy, the stones, saying the world was wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1040.247s">And</a>  unfortunately, the King of Italy did not back him, or else it would have been all Italians in Central America. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1047.609s">So</a>  Queen Isabella gave him the Nina Pinto and Santa Maria, and so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1053.65s">However,</a>  it's most unfortunate, and it saddens a lot of <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1059.149s">we</a>  residents that the Christopher Columbus School was delisted, the name was taken away. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1066.492s">And</a>  mind you, that was done during the so-called Corona 19 pandemic when the world was shut down and we could not even attend the meetings live in person, mind you. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1080.976s">I</a>  would have loved to have that opportunity to say a few syllables. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1087.283s">I</a>  don't know why they took his name down to this day and destroyed statues. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1094.685s">It</a>  makes me ill to think of that, the disrespect. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1099.127s">They're</a>  saying that he's bad, he's a bad man, but no one's shown me any document that he was convicted of any crime and therefore was a felon. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1115.152s">I</a>  don't see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1117.044s">All</a>  I hear is rumors. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1120.405s">I</a>  mean, can all our politicians that were elected, can they truthfully say that they're not felons? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1127.468s">Here,</a>  next door, Austin, Washington, D.C.? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1134.431s">Again,</a>  I thank you, Councilors, for bringing up Italian Heritage Month, but I wish Columbus was back on the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1143.455s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1373.483s">Madam</a>  President, thank you very much and thank you to Councilor Caraviello for putting this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1377.425s">I've</a>  known Barbara DeCristofaro for as long as I can remember growing up in the same neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1382.166s">Friendly</a>  with her father, Jerry, for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1383.807s">He</a>  was a great guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1385.616s">It's</a>  glad it's great to see Barbara pursue this promotional opportunity to be appointed by the administration to position sergeant. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1392.46s">And</a>  I think it's important that you know the brass and our police department is reflective of the population that we serve. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1398.744s">So</a>  with that being said, I'm hoping that I reach out director will take steps to encourage minority and female police officers to take these promotional exams. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1407.029s">for</a>  Barbara to be promoted the first female sergeant in the city of Medford in the year 2022 is kind of showing that our internal recruitment is lacking. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1418.889s">And</a>  we have many talented police officers that are here in this community that would help make the brass in our police department reflective of the population that we have here. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1429.96s">But</a>  we have to encourage those individuals to apply for the civil service exams. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1434.525s">We</a>  need to provide them with the tools necessary to study for the civil service exams so that they'll be in a position <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1449.217s">for</a>  being one of the first.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1655.112s">Any</a>  further discussion from the council?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1658.834s">Madam</a>  President, as part of this paper just like an update from the city administration is Council beers mentioned, we had a $1 million grant project that was funded for the safe routes to school, and that created a bike lane from maybe halfway up the hill on high street to the work school, but part of that project also reconfigured the intersection at Wilbur Street high street. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1677.521s">And</a>  since that time, property, personal residents that have bought <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1686.323s">including</a>  flooding, drainage issues and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1689.606s">We've</a>  seen McKay construction out there at least six times since this project was supposed to be completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1696.911s">So</a>  I'd just like to get an update from the administration as to what the status of the drainage issue is on the corner of Woobin and High Street and how much money the city's expended since the completion of the $1 million grant project and remedying the design defects and on property damage claims since this project's been completed.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1713.066s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1713.786s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1714.786s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1716.047s">Thank</a>  you, Council Member for bringing it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1718.207s">I've</a>  been involved with that project since it started. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1720.908s">If</a>  anyone's driven by, notice it got dug up again for the third time. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1725.289s">Put</a>  back, and then if you talk to the city engineer and the company, they're telling you that they don't think this is going to work anyways. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1734.33s">I</a>  don't even know why they dug it up again, did it? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1736.331s">But</a>  I urge the engineer not to sign off on this until the <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1742.603s">It's</a>  proven that it's going to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1744.205s">And</a>  the other issue is the neighbors be made whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1748.989s">They've</a>  got lawsuits, and they're just pretty much being ignored by either the state or the contractor, which isn't fair to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1756.535s">They're</a>  spending money on legal claims that they shouldn't have had to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1760.399s">And</a>  when you talk to the guys there, they'll tell you that the pump-out comes out too far because it diverts the water into their house instead of away from the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1770.157s">I'd</a>  like to, I know the project is done again. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1772.7s">I</a>  don't know what the final outcome, but I've, I've urged the engineer not to sign off on this until sometime find out if it actually works because they're doubting that it's going to even work.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1789.503s">I</a>  do just want to add, I want to thank Councilor Collins for bringing this forward as someone who bike commutes to work whenever I can, I mean it's it's terrifying as an adult to ride on the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1798.386s">It</a>  doesn't have to be that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1799.807s">So</a>  I think programs like this, I mean infrastructure is really what we need, but programs like this go a long way, especially just announcing at a council meeting letting people to know, you know, pay extra attention to Martin's going to be a lot of kids, a lot of families on the roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1813.04s">doing</a>  what they have every right to do, taking their bikes, walking, rolling, whatever they can do to get to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1818.121s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Collins, as seconded by vice chairs and bears, all those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1822.243s">Oh,</a>  sorry, as amended by Councilor Knight, seconded by vice chair and bears, all those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1828.024s">All</a>  those opposed, motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1832.806s">So</a>  22-526 offered by Councilor Tseng, be it so resolved that the city council recognize October as domestic abuse awareness month, Councilor Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1841.397s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1843.298s">October</a>  is Domestic Abuse Awareness Month. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1846.419s">Domestic</a>  abuse is a issue that unfortunately touches a lot of residents in the city, in the state, around the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1856.584s">And</a>  I think it's important for us to be able to speak more openly about it as a society and to talk about the effects of domestic abuse, to talk about trauma, and to talk about mental health. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1869.47s">Um,</a>  I was fortunate enough to be, um, at a, um, event with the Metro Police Department and Portal to Hope with Councilor Caraviello, where we learned a lot about how, um, trauma, we can use trauma to inform the work that we do in the workplace and as elected officials in our policies, which, um, really starts by listening and understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1893.8s">this</a>  is, of course, a very serious issue, and I am grateful for the opportunity to be able to bring some light to it on the council.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2160.473s">Can</a>  you just explain what the significance of October 26th is?</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2164.476s">I</a>  believe as October 26th being the date that he flew the plane, landing onto the, <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2169.521s">the</a>  first American landing onto a moving aircraft carrier. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2172.022s">I</a>  think there's a number of dates we could choose from, and that was the date requested by the friend of the Toralea.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2242.617s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2243.838s">It's</a>  come to my attention that residents on Sydney Street are facing some difficulties with the facility Budweiser facility, both temporary and permanent. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2254.563s">There's</a>  some temporary changes that have moved a lot of idling trucks and things right into people's basically right across the fence from their backyard. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2261.567s">You</a>  got folks looking, you know, whether intentionally or unintentionally, you know, you're looking right into people's houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2266.409s">There's</a>  a lot of noise, a lot of, <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2268.76s">you</a>  know, just negative impacts on the residents of Sydney Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2271.882s">And</a>  then also some long-term mitigation would be welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2274.903s">Basically</a>  all that the facility has said that they would do is they'll put up a, you know, kind of something on the fence, a solid barrier, which really isn't enough to mitigate the noise and, you know, other impacts of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2287.19s">So</a>  I do know that we have some residents here who are interested in speaking on it, and hopefully we can communicate with the facility to get a little bit more support for those residents.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2298.105s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2298.966s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2300.526s">Hello,</a>  my name's Nadia Puriforia. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2302.228s">I</a>  live at 42 Sydney Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2304.229s">Good</a>  evening, City Council, and thank you, Zach Bears, for the invite. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2308.111s">So</a>  I've lived there since 2005, and basically, it's right behind my house, and there's not been many issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2314.615s">We've</a>  just dealt with light noises through the years, and they've been pretty good neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2319.538s">But</a>  just as of this past summer, we have a pool right in the backyard, and they are apparently working in the parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2326.382s">but</a>  they move their trucks like literally behind our backyard and I have five young girls I have a swimming pool and there's men out there at their lunch breaks and they're parked like along the fence and now since they're doing work in the parking lot they put their actual trucks like right along our fence and it's day and night you get the trucks unloading it's a loud bang it could be two in the morning <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2346.608s">Um,</a>  in the back of the trucks, you can see cases of beer that's just right there visible. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2350.99s">Like</a>  it's just, uh, beyond being, um, an ugly eyesore. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2354.912s">It's</a>  the noise, the lights go right into my girl's bedroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2358.494s">And</a>  last summer they, um, I did speak with the mayor and she called them because originally there was a lot of trees, but the trees were dead. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2365.057s">So</a>  they cut them down. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2366.673s">And</a>  they said they'll put this like cloth sheet up and it basically lasted a couple months fell down. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2372.36s">And</a>  I did speak with the mayor again over the summer and she said she would contact them and they put up a little cloth sheet. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2378.266s">It's</a>  just literally behind my house and it doesn't do anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2381.33s">There's</a>  still people coming out for lunch breaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2383.732s">It</a>  doesn't do anything with the noise and also the pollution, the trucks are like literally running nonstop. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2390.015s">So</a>  I was hoping for the house next to mine has like pine trees behind her house and you really can't see the trucks, you can't see the light, it helps with the noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2399.039s">I</a>  did bring pictures along if anyone wants to see them, but we're hoping either for a wall or something more permanent, because this really isn't helping things. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2410.444s">And</a>  it's once again, like I said, the privacy, the noise, <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2414.085s">Um,</a>  I'm just, I don't know who's in that parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2416.611s">So,</a>  and I have seven children, so there's a lot of, um, my friend, their friends coming over and stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2421.622s">So</a>  I was just hoping for something to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2425.157s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2426.398s">I</a>  don't know if I leave these.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2427.398s">Yeah,</a>  we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2428.299s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2428.499s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2429.44s">Do</a>  you want to come to Carlyle?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2432.502s">Our</a>  city messenger is out tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2434.062s">So</a>  he would normally grab it.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2435.683s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2436.424s">Madam</a>  President, the city clerk be so kind as to investigate report back to the council as to whether or not BJ says any special permits extended our permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2444.669s">So</a>  like, I think one way that we may be able to address this is by bringing them in and saying this is an issue that's going on in the community and you have a permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2455.385s">and</a>  we don't like what you're doing, so we're gonna take a look at your permit and see if we can put some restrictions on it to safeguard the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2461.187s">This</a>  has been an ongoing issue since I got on the council, between Budweiser and BJ's, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2466.809s">Tough</a>  neighbors, you know, large employers in this community, valuable neighbors, you know, bring some good to the community, no doubt. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2473.791s">But</a>  you have to live there, I don't, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2475.131s">And</a>  you know, I know where you live, I know where your house is. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2478.012s">It's</a>  not a little tiny little street, you know what I mean?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2480.253s">It's</a>  not exactly- It used to be a once peaceful, now I just, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2486.073s">I</a>  don't even wanna go in my backyard anymore.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2489.145s">Well,</a>  when it's warm, if you don't wanna go and use your pool, I will. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2494.669s">And</a>  I don't care about those crummy old men over there with their beer. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2497.831s">I'll</a>  watch them and they watch me. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2503.635s">No,</a>  I think that the best bet would be to see if we can call the brass in for BJ. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2507.377s">We've</a>  tried this before. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2508.858s">I</a>  mean, ultimately, I don't think it's gonna help situations that we are right now in the middle of litigation with BJs because we didn't want them to put a gas station in. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2517.418s">So</a>  there's a lot of moving parts going on with that location, but I think that the special permit might be the best way to attack it.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2528.75s">Thank</a>  you, and thank you, Mr. Pierre, for coming out and let us know. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2533.074s">Again,</a>  my recommendation, if we can have our code enforcement officer there on a daily basis, because money talks. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2541.701s">So</a>  every time we see a violation, we should be taking these violations. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2546.365s">And</a>  if it happens three, four times a day, then they should be taken three, four times a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2551.71s">Like</a>  Councilor Knight said, it's getting frustrating for us <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2555.833s">that</a>  when you talk, try to have a conversation or work together with these bigger companies, falls on deaf ears and it's frustrating. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2565.756s">So</a>  I think if we can make a recommendation that we ask a code enforcement officer to make, you know, two trips a day and, you know, really have a pipeline that <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2579.5s">Mr.</a>  Purifori can call them directly, and when you see and hear a violation, that we call them right away and they come right over. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2587.245s">I've</a>  had issues with something as simple as a construction project going on in Fulton Street that we had neighbors, trucks were parking on the sidewalk, kids were trying to walk to school, so we set it up that <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2600.435s">The</a>  constituents that saw something, they called me, I called the code enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2604.157s">After</a>  the fourth ticket, there hasn't been a truck parked on Fulton Street on the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2609.28s">So</a>  I think that if this is how you have to do it, this is how we have to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2615.264s">It's</a>  frustrating, but it's the only way that I see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2618.966s">We've</a>  asked him to come in to talk to him, his partners. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2623.21s">And</a>  between BJ's and Budweiser, there really hasn't been much of a partnership. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2628.191s">So</a>  if we can do that, that'd be something that I would recommend. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2631.252s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2632.252s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2633.233s">I</a>  think to that point, it's more than five minutes of idling is, you know, it's against state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2637.694s">So</a>  it's not even Medford, it's state.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2639.674s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2641.154s">I</a>  was going to bring that up, but under federal law, anything more than five minutes is a violation of the admissions there. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2649.336s">Were</a>  you there when we had that walkthrough? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2652.478s">Like,</a>  like before five years ago we did, we had agreed to hold me right on the property there. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2656.824s">We</a>  walked through and I know a little bit of something got done I know it wasn't done to the satisfaction that we right but I'm Scott was right. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2666.235s">I</a>  think we need to find out. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2669.579s">what</a>  laws they're violating, and yeah, cite it in the park book, and that seems to be the only language they recognize. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2677.501s">And</a>  if we need to have another committee of the whole meeting down there in person, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2682.203s">Just</a>  to let them know that we are serious about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2684.784s">And</a>  it's not fair that they park all those trucks there all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2689.045s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2694.04s">how</a>  it's the trucks, but they said it's because- Are they doing what, working the parking lot out there? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2697.323s">Supposedly,</a>  and they said the trucks will go back to the original area and their cars will come back, but I'm still concerned because they're out there in their lunch breaks and they put their chairs against our fence and it just- Yeah, so that's not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2709.254s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2710.567s">Yeah,</a>  I think they're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2712.108s">I</a>  think the only way to hit them is in the park book. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2714.189s">And</a>  I say we have the court of course, McDonald, go down there and let them know about what's going on down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2724.115s">Even</a>  the violation of the federal admission standards.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2727.197s">Yeah,</a>  those are definitely running through the night. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2730.739s">Five</a>  minutes is five minutes is definitely longer than five minutes.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2734.741s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2735.621s">Vice</a>  Chair Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2737.045s">Thank</a>  you to my fellow councillors. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2739.187s">I</a>  think we have a lot of great options. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2743.187s">I</a>  think we'll reach out to them and see if we can get something. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2746.688s">If</a>  they respond to us at any sort of time, maybe we can get some mitigation done right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2751.05s">Excuse</a>  me. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2752.031s">And</a>  if not, we'll look at, things are just falling from the sky today. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2755.832s">We'll</a>  look at the special permit and the fines. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2758.133s">And</a>  I think Councilor Morell and Councilor Carpio's point about idling is a major point as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2763.255s">So</a>  we'll see what we can do.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2764.416s">And</a>  then do I just appear by email or?</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2767.497s">I'll</a>  keep you in the loop on anything that we hear back.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2778.79s">I</a>  think it is important to point out, though, that this is really a function of the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2783.935s">I</a>  remember when Mike McGlynn was the mayor, he'd get in his car and drive down there and say, I want to meet with the general manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2788.278s">He</a>  wouldn't pick up the phone and call him. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2789.639s">He'd</a>  say, this is what I want done, and go down there to meet with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2791.941s">If</a>  you're not getting that type of service, you're not getting that type of service, and we'll do all that we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2795.585s">But</a>  ultimately, this is an enforcement issue, not a legislative issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2799.848s">So</a>  the administration has to buy into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2802.13s">And</a>  if the administration wants to see it stop, then they have to send their people down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2805.833s">They</a>  have to send code enforcement down there and they have to hold VJs accountable. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2809.215s">This</a>  council can't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2810.516s">We</a>  can call them to the meetings and we can try to work on the permits that fall under our purview. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2815.098s">But</a>  when it comes to the day-to-day operations of the community and code enforcement, that's a department that falls under the building commissioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2820.841s">for</a>  an administrative branch and executive branch department, the mayor has to get them down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2826.425s">And</a>  we can ask until we're blue in the face. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2827.966s">But</a>  if a track record of asking is any indication as to what the administration is going to do, this is going to go on a file like this big right here.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2834.251s">And</a>  we're not going to we're not going to hear back because that's historically what's happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2837.894s">We've</a>  talked <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2838.294s">about</a>  it all day today in our previous meetings as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2841.597s">We</a>  had a subcommittee meeting today to talk about two pieces of draft ordinances that we've asked for. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2847.123s">The</a>  first one was offered in 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2848.985s">It</a>  was a two-sentence draft ordinance that needed review. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2852.369s">The</a>  administration didn't get back to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2853.61s">us.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2854.09s">The</a>  second item was offered in 2020 was a little bit more involved but again the administration still hasn't responded to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2859.791s">So</a>  these are items that this council is asking for for us to create legislation in this community, and we're not getting any, any cooperation. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2868.473s">So</a>  my advice to you would be also to be sure to stay on the administration and let them know your level of dissatisfaction, because they're really the only ones that can solve this <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2882.363s">We're</a>  ready to fight with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2883.344s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2883.764s">I</a>  appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2884.684s">And</a>  use as much authority and power that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2887.126s">However,</a>  that scope and authority is limited under the purview of our responsibilities.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2890.988s">Because</a>  we want to stay in our homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2892.889s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2893.129s">Exactly.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2893.709s">Exactly.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2895.01s">It's</a>  a great quiet street.</p>

    <p>[KttEmL8hj40_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2960.133s">Okay,</a>  well, I just want to say, first of all, thank you to Councilman Caraviello for addressing the issue as promptly as he did, and the rest of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2970.096s">I</a>  was really quite upset to go out on a Saturday morning and see that I had parking meter pole in front of my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2980.178s">I</a>  don't think that they belong in front of private residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2983.439s">I</a>  don't think that they belong in front of a church or a school. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2986.946s">for</a>  me personally, if the meter is there and I have to park in front of my house, I have to run out all day long and feed a meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2995.148s">If</a>  my family members want to visit me, they're going to have to do the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2999.69s">So</a>  I was really upset that the city would do something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3005.111s">And</a>  I'm just hoping that, you know, once you all revisit it, that <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3011.246s">I</a>  won't see a meter in front of my house, but I do want to thank you and for, you know, doing whatever you just did and worked your magic so that the meter was not put in. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3021.513s">So</a>  thank you very much.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3022.754s">Thank</a>  you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3023.135s">Bartholomew.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3024.275s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello then Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3025.476s">I</a>  think, I think someone else wants to speak.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3026.917s">Oh,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3027.878s">On</a>  the same, on the, do you want me to go to the next parking paper or Councilor Knight?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3031.941s">So</a>  Rita, does this mean you're not going to go to the celebration on the completion of the Medford square meter project ice cream truck that the mayor wants to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3045.323s">I</a>  agree with you, and I know Councilor Carvialo and I had spoke on this, and Ricky was telling me how involved he was in working with Faye and the administration to get those taken out. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3056.446s">It</a>  seems like the left hand doesn't know what the right is doing a lot of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3061.888s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3062.568s">There's</a>  someone else on that paper, Councilor Carvialo?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3064.049s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3066.49s">Mr.</a>  Bartolomeo called me on Saturday, and in all honesty, I didn't notice the polls were up. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3072.071s">She</a>  called me and told me, I went by her house and looked, <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3075.165s">kind</a>  of astounded that they went down as far as they did, uh, blocking school. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3079.546s">And</a>  I was even more shocked when I saw it was going to be four in front of St. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3083.647s">Joseph's</a>  church. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3085.287s">You</a>  know, so, uh, listen, you want to put meters in that's fine, but don't put them in front of people's houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3091.508s">And</a>  especially you don't put them in front of houses of worship. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3095.169s">I</a>  never, I mean, we do have some scruples in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3099.389s">I</a>  hope to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3101.11s">And,</a>  um, and, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3103.693s">I</a>  got a call from the church eight o'clock Sunday morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3107.857s">I</a>  got a call from the school Monday morning, and I think I notified all the Councilors on Sunday that this was happening to stop planning on getting calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3116.605s">And</a>  when I sent the message to the mayor, the mayor told me she wasn't aware of the parking meters going in that far. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3125.885s">Um,</a>  at which point, you know, I told her that the gentleman was out there putting heads on the meters then. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3130.97s">And</a>  within an hour, she said that, um, they, uh, they finally had called someone to the department. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3137.876s">They</a>  stopped and they took the heads out. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3139.818s">But,</a>  um, and they did continue to put them on. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3142.561s">But,</a>  uh, driving today, I noticed that the polls are still on Boynton Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3147.305s">Boynton</a>  Road is a residential street. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3149.542s">put</a>  meters on residential streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3152.584s">I</a>  don't know what this department is thinking anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3156.486s">Tonight,</a>  there's going to be an approved have a party to celebrate this great achievement that we've done here. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3164.27s">I</a>  just don't understand it anymore.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3166.631s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3167.211s">Any</a>  further comments on this paper?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3170.813s">Yes,</a>  Madam President, I just think it's important to point out that, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3175.656s">Back</a>  in FY21, when we looked at the $6 million structural deficit that we had, and then again in FY22, when we looked at the $12 million structural deficit that we have in FY23, <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3193.79s">When</a>  we look at the old $700 million or so dollar structural deficit that we have, one of the things that I made very clear during the budget discussions was that we're not going to use the parking program to generate revenues and fill our budget shortfalls. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3208.986s">And</a>  I feel like that's what's happening, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3211.088s">We're</a>  expanding the park. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3212.25s">Now,</a>  three weeks, three weeks in a row, four weeks in a row, four meetings in a row. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3215.893s">We've</a>  had talk about parking right talk about parking talk about failures in the parking department, ticketing people but not supposed to get tickets going down the wrong street and giving everybody on the same street a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3226.338s">Now</a>  the expansion of meters into residential neighborhoods the expansion of meters in front of churches and places of worship and schools and funeral homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3234.321s">All</a>  right, it seems to me like we're trying to use this parking program to generate revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3239.462s">to</a>  address the structural shortfall.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3241.124s">Point</a>  of information, correct me if I'm wrong, I believe the conversation we had with the administration was a new growth was 1.8 million and 1.2 was directly from fees and fines of, so I think it's public. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3256.397s">I</a>  think that from what we were told back in those meetings that this is a process to <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3264.023s">raise</a>  revenue for our community, which is disheartening to me, right?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3267.907s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3268.707s">And,</a>  you know, the packing program when first initiated and first implemented was to turn over spots in the business districts and to enforce residential packing in neighborhoods that were budding public transportation areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3280.898s">that's</a>  expanded now into ninjas jumping out of trees and giving you tickets on if you're facing the wrong way if you don't have an inspection sticker if you have an expired sticker on your license plate uh you know it's it's getting it's getting a little out of hand yet um we get the residents on brook street that have been never-ending problem that's not going to be rectified anytime soon um parking still comes and gives them tickets um there's really no <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3308.572s">And</a>  there's been no dynamic amendment of any of these policy decisions that have been made to satisfy any of our constituency. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3315.696s">And</a>  it just seems to me like the reoccurring theme, if you agree, it's great, we'll hug. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3323.059s">If</a>  you disagree, it's gonna fall on deaf ears and no one's gonna talk to you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3328.682s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Mayne. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3331.023s">So</a>  moving on to our second petition for public participation, <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3336.492s">The</a>  Honorable City Council, Councilors, the undersigned respectfully pray for. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3339.513s">I</a>  would like to talk about the residential parking issues caused on Marion Street with no more residential window stickers being issued, no visitor permits in the windows, out of state plates, and no tickets being issued for any violations to discourage repeated behavior. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3353.495s">How</a>  are residents to know who is and is not supposed to be parking on the street without resident decals, petition signature, and T. Campbell, 75 Marion Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3363.917s">And</a>  again, we have your name and address for the record, so please go ahead.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3366.495s">That</a>  would be me, Ann Campbell, 75 Marion Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3370.336s">And</a>  I have an addendum to the previous statement because I work at St. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3374.777s">Joseph's</a>  School. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3376.717s">So</a>  I have a little aside to that last issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3381.418s">Last</a>  spring, I had called the mayor's office and requested a trash barrel be put at the bus stop right in front of St. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3389.8s">Joseph's</a>  School. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3391.49s">because</a>  people that get on the bus right in front of our door can't bring food or drinks on the bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3400.492s">So</a>  the mayor's office said, oh, well, you'll have to call the DPW to request a trash barrel, which I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3408.794s">I</a>  called the DPW and I said, we need a trash barrel at the bus stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3413.116s">And</a>  they said, oh, well, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3415.193s">You</a>  can't have a trash barrel at St. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3417.233s">Joseph</a>  school. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3418.534s">You're</a>  too far outside the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3421.074s">We</a>  can't do a trash pickup there. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3424.055s">So</a>  we're too far outside the square to get a trash barrel, but we're not too far outside the square to generate tax revenue with a meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3434.757s">So</a>  that kind of confounded us when we had the meters installed there. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3440.06s">So</a>  that was just kind of an aside that was a little bit insulting to us last week, but I'll let that one go. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3448.542s">So</a>  anyway, my issue was residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3452.263s">I</a>  live on Marion Street, which I have for 57 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3457.345s">We</a>  became a residential permit parking street three years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3462.866s">We</a>  recently have had a major uptick in people parking on the street without permits. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3470.789s">So</a>  I watched the council meeting two weeks ago and Faye Morrison was not able to stay. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3480.395s">So</a>  I couldn't ask the question then, but she made a comment that residential stickers for the windshields are no longer being used, which I was not aware of. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3492.982s">And</a>  she also said that there's no intention to bring those stickers back, which I also did not know about. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3501.577s">Well,</a>  how are we supposed to know who is and who is not supposed to be parking on our street? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3509.419s">You</a>  don't know if you don't see the decal in the window. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3513.58s">Well,</a>  she said, the enforcement scans the parking license plates. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3521.082s">Well,</a>  there is no enforcement because I don't see any tickets on any cars on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3528.569s">And</a>  I haven't in months and months. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3531.591s">There</a>  was the other day for the first time and I can't tell you how long. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3536.454s">Now,</a>  when we had Park Medford, I could send an email and they always responded. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3542.758s">They</a>  always came down if you sent an email. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3546.041s">I</a>  didn't even know who to address things to. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3549.563s">So</a>  I went on the website and I found George Bernoski's name. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3556.2s">and</a>  I found a telephone number. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3559.202s">So</a>  I called the phone number listed on the website and it said, one phone number said, we'll call you back as soon as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3568.169s">I</a>  got no response back from that phone number. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3572.152s">So</a>  I called the other phone number which said, we'll get back to you within 24 to 48 hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3579.073s">That</a>  was on September 22nd. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3582.995s">I</a>  still have not received a phone call back from parking department. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3588.619s">Then</a>  I decided to write an email to George Barnosky on September 24th. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3595.403s">I</a>  still have not received a response back from George Barnosky to my email. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3602.688s">So</a>  I'm getting no response back to my questions.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3607.067s">I'm</a>  pretty sure George Bernoski is like the media repairman. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3615.452s">I</a>  think his title is like supervisor of media repair or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3618.834s">I</a>  don't think he has any type of function that has to do with the supervision or the issuance of tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3623.056s">I</a>  think he's more of a <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3625.418s">a</a>  meter fixer, oversees the meter repair program. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3629.18s">If</a>  it's my recollection, I remember when the mayor put out one of her many emails about her new hires that she classified.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3637.044s">There</a>  were two names listed on the website for the traffic and parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3642.087s">So</a>  he was the one I addressed it to. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3644.408s">He</a>  didn't answer back. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3648.991s">And</a>  there's also a permitted street listing. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3653.042s">Marion</a>  Street isn't listed as a permitted street, and we've been permitted for three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3660.729s">So</a>  possibly that's why we're not getting any enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3664.492s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3665.333s">How</a>  often do they update the website? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3668.235s">I</a>  have no idea, but we're not getting enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3673.32s">We</a>  have lots of cars that I don't think belong there because none of the neighbors recognize them. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3680.154s">We</a>  have no decals in the windows, so we couldn't report them if we wanted to. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3685.377s">What</a>  are the neighbors supposed to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3687.358s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3689.379s">But</a>  there's no intention to bring the decals back. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3693.782s">How</a>  are you supposed to know who's supposed to park on a street where the neighbors pay for the decals, pay for the permits to park there, but anybody can park there and they don't have to pay.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3707.835s">So</a>  I'm just a little confused by it all. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3713.86s">So</a>  I'm just looking for some assistance for myself.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3718.063s">I</a>  don't even have to get the decal because I have off the street parking for myself, for my tenants and for the neighbors across the street that don't even have driveway. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3729.892s">I</a>  let them park in my yard on street sweeping days. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3734.266s">but</a>  not everybody has that luxury. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3736.968s">But</a>  because I'm the one that requested the permit parking in the first place, I go and I get the stickers. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3747.455s">But</a>  it's not working anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3751.037s">It</a>  used to work, but it doesn't work anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3753.259s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3755.24s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3755.72s">Thank</a>  you for coming out. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3757.561s">But</a>  I sense your frustration. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3761.234s">since</a>  our last meeting, talking about traffic and parking since we had the director on for a half hour to answer questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3768.558s">We've</a>  had about 30 phone calls and emails. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3770.999s">People</a>  have called me. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3772.42s">One</a>  thing we've recommended that maybe we stop, we reset, we educate both the enforcement officers and the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3782.805s">I</a>  think that that's what <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3787.096s">a</a>  responsible community does when you're unveiling such a huge, impactful scenario like traffic enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3797.305s">Um,</a>  to say that we don't need the sticker anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3800.866s">These</a>  are questions we had to ask, too, and we were cut short, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3803.967s">We</a>  didn't realize I know that Councilor Morell did. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3806.687s">President</a>  Morell did a great job even getting the director here just for, you know, a half hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3812.809s">And</a>  we were told what before the meeting that she was leaving at seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3817.69s">And</a>  after her 30-minute presentation of a presentation she sent us, and then listening to just a few people, there's so many questions still need to be answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3826.656s">This</a>  is frustrating for everyone, yourself, us, because we don't know what to tell you. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3833.18s">That's</a>  what the sad piece is. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3837.163s">And</a>  I don't blame the traffic enforcement officers that they hired, because it's not their fault either. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3842.401s">You</a>  know, when you have three people on the road in the city that met with size and they added all of these residential streets and sidewalks and streets and roadways and said, okay, now let's police those areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3854.59s">It's</a>  impossible to get to Marion street in a daily basis, let alone a weekly basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3858.933s">So</a>  maybe it is wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3860.975s">Maybe</a>  they don't have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3862.256s">We</a>  had a resident come up and tell us that they ticketed 40 tickets on one street. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3866.899s">And</a>  when they asked the question of what problem was, <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3870.447s">They</a>  gave them the wrong street. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3871.528s">They</a>  weren't even on their street. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3874.29s">They</a>  named a street that has a car wash on it and that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3878.614s">So</a>  that just tells you the frustration. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3881.217s">And</a>  I know I get a phone call from a resident said that they were actually, they were enlightened that the enforcement officer came down the street and gave warnings. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3894.011s">We</a>  asked, instead of giving the ticket, why don't you just give a warning so they can, the residents can be proactive and correct the situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3902.858s">And</a>  the director, I believe the director said what, that the dogs would attack them if they get out of the car and gave a warning. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3911.085s">I</a>  guess that dogs are very scared of tickets, just like us. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3914.748s">So</a>  they won't attack with the tickets, but with the warning, they won't. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3919.756s">The</a>  resident called me, said he had a conversation with the gentleman that came out and said, well, the director said that she was not going to give warnings. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3928.064s">And</a>  they said, that's not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3929.565s">And</a>  we were all in the meeting saying, I'm a little confused because the dog doesn't know how to wag the tail. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3935.03s">So</a>  it's getting frustrating. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3937.478s">So,</a>  and again, I will call, I would love to call another meeting, a Committee of the Whole meeting where we bring city administration, a traffic enforcement director back out in front of us to answer some of these questions that still have yet to be answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3951.002s">And,</a>  you know, the situation at St. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3953.183s">Joe's,</a>  if it wasn't for Ricky's phone call and reaching out and getting everybody involved, they'd be meters there. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3962.611s">and</a>  people be getting ticket and towed. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3964.552s">So</a>  there's a lot of questions still have to be answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3967.333s">There's</a>  a lot of concerns in this community about a traffic program. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3971.095s">So</a>  I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3973.056s">I</a>  wish I had an answer for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3975.257s">My</a>  recommendation again would be to, <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3979.081s">review,</a>  do an audit of all of these concerns that we have with our residents, with the director and her team, to see what we can do to mitigate any future concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3990.645s">Because</a>  I can't imagine how bad this is going to be once we have to park on one side of the street or the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3997.488s">And</a>  how are they going to enforce this? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4000.509s">It's</a>  going to be a real scary winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4004.41s">You</a>  know, this is just a prelude to what we're seeing. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4006.492s">So</a>  again, I wish we could do more. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4009.734s">We</a>  feel your frustration. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4012.276s">But</a>  again, all we can do is, you know, maybe ask for another meeting with the director, because it seems to be that that's the only person that can answer our questions.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4023.964s">And</a>  a half an hour wasn't enough.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4025.565s">No,</a>  it wasn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4026.065s">I</a>  agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4026.766s">And</a>  we told them that. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4028.267s">And</a>  Council President worked her tail off just to make sure that she was here. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4032.589s">So</a>  it floored us when we heard that we have a half hour and there were 30 people waiting to talk about some, you know, just to get an answer, just like you did. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4040.714s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4041.6s">And</a>  unfortunately, you're here today to express that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4044.521s">And</a>  we can't really give you the answer that good or bad, because at least we can have closure if there was someone that could give us something. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4052.504s">And</a>  I don't have much faith you get that phone call, by the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4055.466s">I</a>  apologize for that.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4056.146s">No,</a>  I noticed that.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4057.006s">But</a>  I would really try to call the communications department, the mayor's office, chief of staff, and ask their guidance on who you should call, because you've obviously tried the numbers that were there. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4066.67s">So</a>  that would be my recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4069.052s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4069.932s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4070.232s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4070.493s">Thank</a>  you for listening.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4071.513s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4072.634s">Going</a>  to Councilor Kalas and Vice Mayor Bears.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4075.816s">Thank</a>  you, President Merlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4077.057s">Thank</a>  you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4077.517s">Campbell,</a>  for being here tonight and to the other residents that are speaking about their experiences with parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4085.682s">The</a>  last time we spoke about this, <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4089.399s">Yeah,</a>  I know, I'm like, what instance was it? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4092.201s">I</a>  made the comment, I think something along the lines of, you know, wondering because of the volume of complaints that we've been getting about residents' experience with parking and also complaints from within the parking department itself, from the rank and file and from the leadership wondering, was this department set up to succeed or was it set up to fail? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4110.513s">And</a>  listening to, you know, the resident experience, <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4119.306s">you</a>  know, the new parking rules as they're filtering through the residence experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4123.91s">It</a>  strikes me that, you know, something that my dad used to tell me about writing is, you know, you can't brainstorm and edit at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4131.878s">You</a>  can't write and edit at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4134.04s">And</a>  I know from conversations with director Morrison that there's, sorry, this whole circus going on over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4138.945s">I'm</a>  a little distracted. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4139.886s">I</a>  don't know what's going on.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4142.124s">And</a>  also, my advice was embarrassed. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4143.965s">I'm</a>  rapidly losing my voice, so I apologize for continued distractions.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4147.687s">That's</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4149.248s">You</a>  know, you can't write and edit at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4150.889s">And</a>  I know that it's a huge mantle to spin up a whole new city department from nothing, you know, from a contractor that I think, you know, a lot of sources have said was mismanaging our parking system in the city beforehand. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4162.015s">But</a>  it brings me back to that same question about was this department set up to succeed? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4166.717s">Was</a>  it set up to fail? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4168.518s">Is</a>  it even conceivable that a project of this scale <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4171.62s">could</a>  be started and refined and take back resident feedback and be guided and be modifying what it's doing all at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4180.024s">And</a>  it seems like that isn't really happening based on what we're hearing from residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4186.468s">And</a>  I know that, you know, it's our parking department staff that's executing the work on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4194.612s">But,</a>  you know, we get very strong city communications about certain topics from our city administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4200.915s">about</a>  certain types of events and certain types of updates and certain types of developments in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4206.596s">And,</a>  you know, I'm really upset about the adverse effects of the new parking program on residents when they've been burdened by this and when they felt unheard. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4217.179s">But</a>  I'm also upset that the city administration isn't stepping up and taking more of the <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4222.08s">of</a>  the Brunton more the responsibility for directing this, um, in the way that I think it's their responsibility to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4229.182s">And</a>  so you know, we seem to have a great capacity for communicating about certain types of developments and certain types of updates in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4235.643s">And</a>  I think I think we're past due for seeing more of that capacity spread to the parking department, not just that it's more fair to the rank and file parking staff, the ones that are charged with just executing. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4246.266s">the</a>  protocols, but also for the benefit of the residents who months later are still struggling to stay up to date with what's already been said about what we can expect. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4253.728s">Why</a>  is this happening? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4254.628s">When</a>  is it going to change? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4255.548s">Is</a>  it going to change? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4257.329s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4259.309s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4262.19s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4264.491s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4266.131s">Councilor</a>  Collins made a point, but was this program set up to fail? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4271.573s">It</a>  probably was. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4272.875s">You</a>  know, you open a department of this size, and the administration touted, what a great job did they get it up and running in such a short period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4282.884s">Well,</a>  it wasn't a great job getting done in a short period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4286.287s">The</a>  program needed more time to be refined and figured out what had to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4291.512s">Again,</a>  for the members who weren't here, when Park Metro came in, Park Metro came in at a bad time. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4297.177s">They</a>  realized they made mistakes. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4298.998s">They</a>  stopped. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4300.844s">They</a>  took three, four more months and figured out what they were doing wrong, what was wrong, and they fixed it and rolled the program out again. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4309.09s">This</a>  program doesn't want to admit that it's made any mistakes. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4315.035s">And</a>  it's made many mistakes. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4316.936s">One</a>  of the questions I wanted to ask last week was, <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4320.082s">When</a>  they were ticketing all the streets, all the cars on the streets with wrong addresses, what about all the people who just didn't have the time to appeal to them and they just say, hey, I'll pay the $25 because I don't have time to go to registry. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4332.327s">I</a>  don't have the time to say, hey, maybe I was wrong and just pay the $25. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4335.769s">Are</a>  any of those people getting their money back? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4339.07s">No</a>  idea, no idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4341.031s">And</a>  again, you know, like I said, calls are still coming in all over the place from all different parts of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4346.971s">And</a>  again, it's a program that was put out with a bum's rush and instead of the thought that it took to put the, especially with the meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4358.239s">Well,</a>  it was a bit, at the end of the day, when it was all done, the answer that came back was, it was a miscommunication. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4367.162s">another</a>  miscommunication. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4368.243s">There's</a>  been a lot of miscommunications. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4370.524s">Again,</a>  Councilor Scott is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4372.425s">We</a>  made a motion a couple of weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4375.626s">Stop</a>  ticketing people until you figure out that we're doing it right. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4380.689s">Let's</a>  get the program fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4382.39s">Don't</a>  keep going in a bad direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4387.432s">Sheila's</a>  on Marion Street, which is a pretty crowded street. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4391.935s">I</a>  grew up on William Street, which was the next street. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4394.676s">Wait</a>  till the train station comes in over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4398.589s">She's</a>  within walking distance of the ball street, of the ball square station. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4403.312s">What</a>  do you think, people aren't gonna be parking in our neighborhood then? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4405.874s">All</a>  over Winchester Street and all those surrounding streets? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4409.636s">There's</a>  not even any talk about that when that station opens up, coming down the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4415.48s">And</a>  nevermind about the station at Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4419.903s">all</a>  those hillside streets are gonna be, and all those streets down in College Ave are gonna be people walking, parking the cars and walking. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4426.749s">There's</a>  no talk about doing anything over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4428.851s">So</a>  again, I think it's time that we stop, that this program stop and reassess and figure out what is doing wrong and let's figure it out and do it right.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4441.121s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4442.042s">I</a>  mean, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4449.502s">No,</a>  I still have. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4450.222s">There's</a>  still another.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4452.623s">If</a>  I may, from the chair, just add a couple of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4456.365s">One</a>  is that I can't remember when we filed. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4459.786s">I</a>  filed it or we passed it, but we have requested that the traffic and parking decisions and rules and regulations actually be posted on the city website. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4467.789s">They're</a>  currently not, which would be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4471.151s">And</a>  then as pertains to these specific issues, if possible, Mr. Clerk, if you <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4479.736s">I</a>  think that maybe we'll get an answer since you haven't received a response. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4482.879s">Maybe</a>  we will get one faster.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4484.1s">But</a>  that's just something I was going to say before I came up to be the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4492.187s">President</a>  Morales.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4493.36s">I'll</a>  be brief because I don't really have a voice, but I also do just have concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4496.161s">I</a>  mean, things like putting in meter heads that need to be immediately removed, that costs money. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4500.563s">What</a>  kind of money are we losing? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4502.023s">I</a>  mean, these are costly mistakes. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4503.984s">At</a>  a department that I understand needs a certain amount of funding to get up and running, but this is stuff that's easily avoided. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4509.306s">So</a>  that just gives me great pause.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4517.409s">Any</a>  further discussion on this petition? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4520.434s">Any</a>  other folks who'd like to speak public participation is open. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=4523.615s">Please</a>  come to the podium.</p>
