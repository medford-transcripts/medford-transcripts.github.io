1
00:00:54,692 --> 00:00:59,135
Melvin, Laurel, there's a bunch of, there's like an iPhone user, a cell phone user.

2
00:00:59,176 --> 00:01:00,737
Let me know what you want me to just submit everyone.

3
00:01:02,358 --> 00:01:08,143
Okay, I think John is the last committee member we're waiting for.

4
00:01:13,507 --> 00:01:15,328
Here's John, I just let him in.

5
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:16,249
Awesome.

6
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:18,150
So it looks like then everybody else is.

7
00:01:18,471 --> 00:01:21,233
Okay, go ahead.

8
00:01:21,633 --> 00:01:23,955
And I'm gonna go ahead and start recording on our end.

9
00:01:24,652 --> 00:01:24,912
Great.

10
00:01:25,132 --> 00:01:25,773
Thank you, Laura.

11
00:01:30,136 --> 00:01:31,356
Recording in progress.

12
00:01:31,376 --> 00:01:35,919
Okay, so I'll admit all now.

13
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,080
Yes, please.

14
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:47,867
Hey, I'd like to welcome everyone.

15
00:01:49,378 --> 00:01:54,601
And thank you to Mike for being the Zoom administrator tonight, and Matt for taking minutes.

16
00:01:55,642 --> 00:02:06,388
We also, we have Janelle Austin from KP Law, Anthony Wilson from Collins Center, and we'll also have, I think, a couple more Collins Center people, and we'll be hearing from them over the course of the meeting.

17
00:02:08,089 --> 00:02:15,893
But we wanted to start by reviewing, or has anyone had a chance to review the minutes from our December 12th meeting?

18
00:02:16,854 --> 00:02:17,034
Yes.

19
00:02:20,396 --> 00:02:27,384
do we feel like we need to review them here or can we just go ahead and vote on accepting them or not?

20
00:02:27,404 --> 00:02:28,004
Move approval.

21
00:02:30,347 --> 00:02:30,988
I'm sorry, Eunice.

22
00:02:31,388 --> 00:02:32,029
Move approval.

23
00:02:32,509 --> 00:02:32,770
Yep.

24
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:36,534
Somebody makes a motion and then it's from one second.

25
00:02:37,094 --> 00:02:37,335
Okay.

26
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,041
Eunice, did you make the motion?

27
00:02:44,461 --> 00:02:46,903
Yes, she did and Maury seconded it.

28
00:02:47,123 --> 00:02:51,345
Okay, so all in favor of approving the minutes as per Eunice's motion?

29
00:02:52,326 --> 00:02:52,506
Aye.

30
00:02:52,926 --> 00:02:53,067
Aye.

31
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:54,027
Aye.

32
00:02:54,567 --> 00:02:54,808
Aye.

33
00:02:55,628 --> 00:02:56,709
Any opposed?

34
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,110
Okay, great.

35
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:06,414
So the minutes- I abstain as liaison, I can't, but yeah.

36
00:03:07,215 --> 00:03:08,536
So the minutes have been accepted.

37
00:03:08,716 --> 00:03:09,296
That's great.

38
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:15,240
Now we're going to move into the business of the meeting and Laurel is going to take over.

39
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,060
Absolutely.

40
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:30,803
Um, so, uh, yeah, basically I'll just, uh, Janelle, I'll go ahead and make you, um, a cohost so that, uh, any materials that you want to present to anybody.

41
00:03:30,983 --> 00:03:39,745
Um, so Janelle is, uh, joining us from KP law so that she can give us some guidance on the open meeting law and public records laws.

42
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:40,725
Um,

43
00:03:41,282 --> 00:03:43,104
that will inform our work.

44
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:50,211
Thank you very much.

45
00:03:50,251 --> 00:03:53,174
Thank you to members of the committee for having me here tonight.

46
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:55,937
I understand that there were some materials previously

47
00:03:56,847 --> 00:04:00,868
provided to the committee, so I'm not going to rehash all of the materials.

48
00:04:00,928 --> 00:04:18,152
I understand I have about 15 minutes to kind of touch on some highlights this evening, but really wanted, and I'm happy to supply those materials again afterwards, but I really wanted to focus on a couple of really salient and timely points with respect to the public records law.

49
00:04:18,728 --> 00:04:23,235
The open meeting law, we can certainly answer any conflict of interest questions as well.

50
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:33,852
As a starting point, the public records law, open meeting law, and conflict of interest law are all what we call sunshine laws or government transparency laws.

51
00:04:34,472 --> 00:04:38,916
And as a public body, you are subject to the open meeting law.

52
00:04:38,976 --> 00:04:42,419
So I thought we would start with that discussion first.

53
00:04:43,099 --> 00:04:46,882
And then we can certainly, you know, touch upon the other two topics.

54
00:04:46,962 --> 00:04:51,106
But I think the open meeting law is probably what the members will deal with the most.

55
00:04:52,026 --> 00:04:56,070
You know, many of you have significant experience in open meeting law issues.

56
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:07,164
And for those that don't, certainly it's something that, you know, the Attorney General's Division of Open Government has put out a lot of great materials for public body members.

57
00:05:07,605 --> 00:05:13,072
But essentially, members of a public body, a municipal public body, are subject to the open meeting law.

58
00:05:13,719 --> 00:05:29,088
And the open meeting law requires that the committee conduct its business the majority of the time in what we call open session, which is a public setting open to members of the public to observe what is inspiring.

59
00:05:30,048 --> 00:05:41,555
So essentially, if there's a quorum of your committee, which we have this evening, the body's business has to be conducted so members of the public can see what's taking place.

60
00:05:42,496 --> 00:05:58,894
That requires, as all of you know, as you did for this evening, you know, notice 48 hours in advance, you know, an opportunity for members to communicate and deliberate an open session in minutes to be prepared and approved in a timely manner.

61
00:05:59,768 --> 00:06:05,032
The bulk of the committee's business will largely be conducted in what we call open session.

62
00:06:05,873 --> 00:06:11,977
There is an executive session portion of the open meeting law, which deals with confidential matters.

63
00:06:12,517 --> 00:06:14,539
Those are really fact specific.

64
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:19,603
So obviously, if you ever have a specific question about executive session, I'd be happy to answer that as well.

65
00:06:20,684 --> 00:06:29,792
It's really dealing with, you know, generally complaints or more sensitive types of information, real estate transactions, litigation, etc.

66
00:06:29,852 --> 00:06:36,018
So I'm going to focus the majority of the time on, you know, deliberation, because I think that's really most helpful.

67
00:06:36,038 --> 00:06:42,044
And what I see a lot, a lot of questions come up within my work with public bodies throughout the state.

68
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:51,347
The members of the committee know that, you know, a meeting is a deliberation amongst a quorum of the public body's members.

69
00:06:52,508 --> 00:06:57,532
You know, a meeting we know isn't if you meet each other on the street.

70
00:06:58,192 --> 00:07:09,895
or at a social gathering or private social event, but care should be taken that if you do, you're not deliberating on anything that's within the committee's jurisdiction.

71
00:07:10,035 --> 00:07:10,915
So what does that mean?

72
00:07:11,435 --> 00:07:19,537
That means if you're catching up on family or friends, or you see each other at a community event, that's fine.

73
00:07:19,977 --> 00:07:26,239
We just don't want to have the appearance that there's deliberation outside of this setting at a properly posted meeting.

74
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:30,870
That the term meeting is strictly interpreted.

75
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:38,276
So, you know, it can involve discussions in a hallway or phone calls or email or posts.

76
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:40,559
And we're gonna talk about that in a little bit of detail.

77
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:45,103
And it was in the materials that I had previously submitted to the committee as well.

78
00:07:46,284 --> 00:07:51,228
But basically any discussion has to take place so members of the public can see it.

79
00:07:51,849 --> 00:07:52,950
The question I get a lot on

80
00:07:54,431 --> 00:07:57,412
is what about written communications?

81
00:07:57,792 --> 00:08:05,335
And written communications and oral communications are specifically addressed in the open meeting law.

82
00:08:06,035 --> 00:08:09,756
And email is also specifically addressed.

83
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:10,677
So what does that mean?

84
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:30,438
For a best practice, my recommendation is that email only be used by members of the committee for meeting agendas, scheduling purposes, or just to provide reports or documents, but that no substantive communications or discussions take place.

85
00:08:30,998 --> 00:08:34,522
So we don't want a situation where one member is sending an email,

86
00:08:35,116 --> 00:08:53,800
and a quorum of the public body is responding, or what we call a serial communication, where one person receives an email, forwards it to another person, forwards it to another person, and then we have a quorum of the committee, all expressing ideas or opinions outside of this setting, a properly posted meeting.

87
00:08:54,673 --> 00:09:05,226
So I always caution members of a public body to use email for a very specific purpose, which is really for scheduling.

88
00:09:06,904 --> 00:09:08,705
That would be my recommendation.

89
00:09:08,945 --> 00:09:33,357
Some public bodies will include members will include at the bottom of their email, you know, please be mindful of open meeting law considerations, you know, if there's an email even about can we meet, you know, February 1 at 630, or can we meet at seven, so that there's not an instinct to do a reply or apply all that may trigger open meeting law requirements.

90
00:09:35,329 --> 00:09:39,732
There's some other practical approaches that I just wanted to share with the members as well.

91
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:47,717
If you are attending another public body meeting in your individual capacity, you might wanna say that.

92
00:09:47,737 --> 00:09:56,123
I'm here as a resident, I'm not here on behalf of the Charter Study Committee, I'm here in my individual capacity.

93
00:09:56,643 --> 00:10:02,547
Because if there's multiple members of your committee attending, for instance, a city council meeting,

94
00:10:03,085 --> 00:10:06,846
that may trigger posting requirements under the open meeting law as well.

95
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,506
So I just wanted to flag that.

96
00:10:09,126 --> 00:10:22,070
Obviously, if you're meeting with another public body, which can happen from time to time, you would consider posting in a major, you know, quorum of your body's meeting and a quorum of another body's meeting, you'd post a joint meeting.

97
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,890
And we can certainly talk about that if that comes up as well.

98
00:10:26,311 --> 00:10:32,052
So again, you might want to consider if you're speaking on your own behalf to say I'm speaking in my individual capacity just to

99
00:10:32,495 --> 00:10:34,957
dispel any appearance you're acting as a member.

100
00:10:34,977 --> 00:10:57,632
So we wanna be aware of reply all to emails, limit the use of email to only scheduling purposes, and also assume that email is going to be forwarded to unintended recipients perhaps, I see that often, and don't ask or express opinions to other members in an email.

101
00:11:00,364 --> 00:11:02,705
really be cognizant of the use of email.

102
00:11:03,105 --> 00:11:06,226
I would say that also translates to text messages as well.

103
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:16,630
So just because it's on a personal device, and we'll talk about this in the public records context, but because it's on a personal email account or a personal cell phone,

104
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,161
It doesn't matter.

105
00:11:18,181 --> 00:11:34,190
We know that the guidance from the Attorney General's Office, as well as the Supervisor of Records, says that if you are sending a document related to city business, related to your work on the committee, it's subject to the public records law.

106
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:37,351
and also would trigger open meeting while requirements.

107
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:39,571
So I just want to be very clear about that.

108
00:11:39,591 --> 00:11:42,052
That question comes up all of the time.

109
00:11:42,072 --> 00:11:47,394
And I know you're all volunteers doing doing this work on behalf of the city.

110
00:11:47,414 --> 00:11:54,016
And your use of personal devices doesn't doesn't take it outside of the context of these laws.

111
00:11:56,269 --> 00:12:03,530
I'd be happy to answer any specific questions on the public records or open meeting law before I move to public records.

112
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:19,753
I just wanted to also say that the rules for email and text messages also apply, we know from guidance from the state, to social media posts, Facebook posts, Twitter posts, Instagram, blogs, et cetera.

113
00:12:20,433 --> 00:12:25,414
And so if there's a quorum, you certainly all have individual First Amendment rights.

114
00:12:26,514 --> 00:12:40,042
But if a quorum of the committee is posting and deliberating on blogs or social media on matters within your jurisdiction, it may trigger open meeting law requirements that comes up from time to time as well.

115
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:50,147
So just be aware in terms of practice and really being clear about whether you're posting something as an individual or as a member of the committee.

116
00:12:51,427 --> 00:12:54,610
I know there's a lot to digest under the open meeting law.

117
00:12:55,411 --> 00:13:00,135
If there's any questions before I move on to public records, I'd be happy to answer those.

118
00:13:00,575 --> 00:13:03,798
Or if you want to wait to the end, however the chairs would like to handle it.

119
00:13:03,818 --> 00:13:10,924
I think if we have questions now, it looks like Ron has a question.

120
00:13:11,185 --> 00:13:12,406
We should go ahead and do that.

121
00:13:14,242 --> 00:13:14,562
Thank you.

122
00:13:15,122 --> 00:13:21,565
My quick question is, you know, I've been in these open meeting committees before.

123
00:13:22,966 --> 00:13:42,735
Google Docs and the access to Google Docs and preparing presentations and giving everybody accessibility to edit and whatever, what are the limitations in terms of collaboration and subcommittees or whatever like that that allows one person to go in and edit or add a document?

124
00:13:44,587 --> 00:13:47,389
What kind of rules do we need to follow in that regard?

125
00:13:47,569 --> 00:13:48,750
That's an excellent question.

126
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:55,214
And that has come up a lot more in the past couple of years, where remote meetings have been authorized.

127
00:13:56,455 --> 00:14:05,260
The use of Google Docs or document sharing software is generally not permissible for members of a public body.

128
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:11,724
Because essentially, if you have a document and everyone is sharing their opinions and beliefs in that document,

129
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,463
amending meeting minutes that comes up from time to time as well.

130
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:21,787
You're essentially communicating beliefs or ideas outside of a properly posted meeting.

131
00:14:22,327 --> 00:14:33,957
And so the best practice, in my opinion, would be it's fine to have electronic versions, but you'd really want to only discuss your individual comments at a properly posted meeting.

132
00:14:34,897 --> 00:14:41,643
And so that's something that based on the use of evolving technology, we know that that would constitute

133
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:47,574
or may constitute a deliberation depending on what is shared outside of a properly posted meeting.

134
00:14:47,814 --> 00:14:48,455
Good question.

135
00:14:48,475 --> 00:14:57,202
Do you want to go ahead?

136
00:14:57,402 --> 00:14:59,704
Yeah, thank you for your presentation.

137
00:14:59,764 --> 00:15:01,185
I have two questions.

138
00:15:02,326 --> 00:15:06,449
The first one relates to remote participation.

139
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:18,738
that we're where we are now with the laws that we're working under that have been, I think, revised a few times through this pandemic time.

140
00:15:18,778 --> 00:15:27,324
And I think the laws are changing again, or whatever law we're operating under now is expiring or something at the end of March.

141
00:15:28,185 --> 00:15:36,851
What are, or will be, if you know what the law will be in terms of remote participation from

142
00:15:38,846 --> 00:15:47,915
public body members, if we were to, if the law changes to go to, you know, well, I guess we can meet in person.

143
00:15:47,935 --> 00:15:51,038
This body has chosen to meet on Zoom for the time being.

144
00:15:52,280 --> 00:16:01,149
Will body members, if we choose to, for personal reasons, be able to continue to participate via Zoom?

145
00:16:02,504 --> 00:16:04,085
That would be my first question.

146
00:16:04,645 --> 00:16:10,226
And then my second question relates to the use of social media.

147
00:16:11,147 --> 00:16:20,209
I'm somewhat of a prolific poster on social media involved in local politics and things, my opinions and so forth.

148
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:28,592
And I think what we all hope is that we can engage the public in this process.

149
00:16:29,442 --> 00:16:48,432
both formally when we have public engagement meetings down the road, but certainly to get people interested in what we're doing and, you know, coming on to meetings and so forth, and sharing facts and progress and so forth about, you know, what we're doing here.

150
00:16:49,613 --> 00:16:56,356
How can we do that or can we do that via social media, sharing, you know, what we're up to

151
00:16:57,762 --> 00:17:12,402
you know, getting the public interested so that they do jump onto our meetings in the future and sharing what could go into a charter, what a charter is, just in general about our work and following on the right side of the law.

152
00:17:13,763 --> 00:17:14,123
Thank you.

153
00:17:14,163 --> 00:17:15,865
Those are two excellent questions.

154
00:17:16,305 --> 00:17:17,467
I'll start with the first one.

155
00:17:17,487 --> 00:17:23,712
You are correct that under the COVID legislation, which has been extended several times since 2020.

156
00:17:25,374 --> 00:17:34,382
Currently, the legislation that allows remote participation without a remote participation policy is expiring March 31, 2023.

157
00:17:36,547 --> 00:17:41,668
We are closely monitoring that legislation to see if it will be extended.

158
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:50,150
When it was extended this summer, there was some discussion at the state house in terms of a permanent extension for this.

159
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,131
And so that's closely being monitored.

160
00:17:53,171 --> 00:17:59,192
There's different bills that are pending to allow this to be on a permanent basis.

161
00:18:00,372 --> 00:18:02,853
Nothing has passed yet, but we're monitoring that.

162
00:18:03,788 --> 00:18:21,904
If come the end of March, that legislation goes away, there's no further extension or no permanent measure, then in my opinion, the city would still have the option to adopt what's called a remote participation policy, which does allow members to participate remotely.

163
00:18:21,924 --> 00:18:30,412
It's different than what's allowed under the COVID relief, because it does require some members to be present, including the chair.

164
00:18:31,798 --> 00:18:33,819
But there is an option to do that.

165
00:18:33,899 --> 00:18:36,760
And I can certainly send some information as necessary.

166
00:18:36,841 --> 00:18:43,563
But like I said, I'm closely monitoring what's happening at the state level, because I've heard this from multiple public bodies.

167
00:18:44,564 --> 00:18:47,565
So I can certainly keep obviously keep you all updated.

168
00:18:48,526 --> 00:18:49,086
In terms of

169
00:18:50,044 --> 00:19:09,312
In terms of online posting, you know, I know that there was the announcement when the committee was formed, you know, best practice again, not because anyone is doing anything wrong or doesn't mean well, but just to avoid any appearance of deliberation outside of a properly posted meeting.

170
00:19:10,012 --> 00:19:14,334
If there's a staff, you know, a city hall staff member or a liaison that can post.

171
00:19:14,878 --> 00:19:18,060
it's always better than having a public body member post.

172
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:30,306
And usually it comes up where, you know, member A would post something and then member B would chime in and member C, and it's all very non-intentional, but it could trigger the open meeting law.

173
00:19:31,486 --> 00:19:44,173
So, you know, as I said, everyone has first amendment rights, but if you're posting in your capacity as a committee member, it may make sense just to have the city through the city's website, put general updates up,

174
00:19:45,216 --> 00:19:49,720
which may take it outside, you know, certainly your minutes are gonna be prepared and approved.

175
00:19:50,801 --> 00:20:01,148
Scheduling, I don't have an issue with, you know, alerting members of the public, but it may make sense to send that out, you know, on an official basis through City Hall, if that makes sense.

176
00:20:02,289 --> 00:20:08,754
Yeah, I guess what I'm more getting at is things come up with,

177
00:20:10,512 --> 00:20:14,175
you know, people wondering how do I explain this?

178
00:20:16,297 --> 00:20:21,401
You know, our elected officials now have, don't have term limits.

179
00:20:21,481 --> 00:20:24,144
They have two year terms and so forth.

180
00:20:24,204 --> 00:20:25,825
And something may come up in a discussion.

181
00:20:26,346 --> 00:20:36,114
Well, you know, how come we don't have term limits or how come they only serve two years or how can we recall a politician or something like that?

182
00:20:36,855 --> 00:20:37,035
Well,

183
00:20:37,771 --> 00:21:02,803
we would have to change our charter in order to do that, you know, and, you know, trying to explain things to people so that, you know, there's a method to this and trying to educate people about what a charter is, what charter review is, what we're doing here, I guess, you know, leaving that to the city to do.

184
00:21:03,682 --> 00:21:11,324
Yes, and I think that that would be fine as long as there's not this interaction with respect to other members.

185
00:21:11,624 --> 00:21:28,008
And I know it's really hard to kind of figure out where the line is drawn, but you certainly wouldn't want to direct your comments to other public body members or, you know, essentially engage in a conversation that would occur at one of these meetings.

186
00:21:28,777 --> 00:21:29,878
online, right?

187
00:21:29,918 --> 00:21:32,060
That's the spirit of the open meeting law.

188
00:21:33,401 --> 00:21:43,549
And so, you know, if you're directing comments, and I'm not saying this is what's happening, but if there was a direction and other people chime in, I think that would be problematic if it was done.

189
00:21:44,009 --> 00:21:47,412
But if it's just, you know, one way interaction,

190
00:21:47,998 --> 00:21:48,919
Trying to educate people.

191
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:50,500
Trying to educate people.

192
00:21:50,561 --> 00:21:54,404
And it's not, again, it goes back to that definition of deliberation.

193
00:21:54,424 --> 00:21:59,089
Is it a deliberation amongst members of the committee?

194
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:00,230
Right.

195
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:03,313
So we just want to be very cognizant of that not occurring.

196
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,721
Okay, thank you.

197
00:22:05,761 --> 00:22:07,482
Just for a clarification here.

198
00:22:07,722 --> 00:22:23,670
Um, would it be a distinction, you know, if, if one of us is making a post, obviously, you know, as just a lay individual, as opposed to saying, I am a member of this committee, and I'm saying this, does that does that alter the conversation at all?

199
00:22:24,663 --> 00:22:25,184
It does.

200
00:22:25,204 --> 00:22:30,727
I mean, I think, again, it's kind of hard because you're all in the position and you've been appointed to the committee.

201
00:22:30,827 --> 00:22:34,030
So everyone understands you're coming from that vantage point.

202
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:41,315
But again, you know, no one is suggesting that people don't have their First Amendment rights to comment on municipal government or the city.

203
00:22:41,335 --> 00:22:47,539
It comes down to really, I think it makes sense to clarify that.

204
00:22:48,477 --> 00:23:10,741
that you're not speaking on behalf of the committee, and this isn't the official position of the committee, however, X, Y, and Z. But just sometimes, like I said, when I see this, and it's usually in the context of responding to an open meeting law complaint, it's very non-intentional, and it just kind of, not spirals, but it goes from one communication to the other very quickly.

205
00:23:10,761 --> 00:23:16,662
And when it's put together, it could constitute a deliberation.

206
00:23:17,706 --> 00:23:23,092
caution to be very conscientious in terms of online communications.

207
00:23:27,276 --> 00:23:28,598
Jean, you have your hand raised.

208
00:23:29,999 --> 00:23:30,460
Hi, Janelle.

209
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,921
Thanks for presenting today.

210
00:23:33,865 --> 00:23:38,608
I have a question about subcommittees because we have talked about having subcommittees.

211
00:23:38,768 --> 00:23:49,554
I just want to confirm if we create subcommittees that they will need to meet open meeting law, including quorum and posting a notice and public participation.

212
00:23:49,574 --> 00:23:51,155
If you could just confirm that.

213
00:23:51,836 --> 00:23:52,516
That is correct.

214
00:23:52,656 --> 00:24:02,102
So subcommittees that are created by public bodies that are subject to the open meeting law, such as yourself, are also subject to the open meeting law.

215
00:24:03,007 --> 00:24:10,151
That requires notice, open meetings, unless there's an executive session purpose, and minutes to be kept.

216
00:24:10,671 --> 00:24:21,117
The only exception to that rule is if, for instance, a superintendent or a mayor who's not subject to the open meeting law creates a subcommittee to advise, you know,

217
00:24:21,652 --> 00:24:26,355
herself on those particular issues, that wouldn't be, but that's not what we're dealing with here.

218
00:24:26,375 --> 00:24:33,200
So in my opinion, yes, it would be subject, any subcommittee created by your committee would be subject to the open meeting law.

219
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:42,687
All right, do we have any other questions on the open meeting law or otherwise we can move on to the public records law?

220
00:24:42,707 --> 00:24:45,009
All right.

221
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,931
I think, did Anthony, did you have a question?

222
00:24:47,951 --> 00:24:50,093
Yeah, just real briefly.

223
00:24:51,244 --> 00:24:59,310
Do you have any recommendations on how to kind of differentiate, you know, personal opinion and being a member of the committee?

224
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:11,439
You know, do you have to identify yourself as a member of this committee, say on a political question on social media or when you're commenting?

225
00:25:11,459 --> 00:25:16,423
Do you have any recommendations on how to make sure we don't cross that line?

226
00:25:17,095 --> 00:25:17,375
Sure.

227
00:25:17,495 --> 00:25:25,460
So I used to say before the proliferation of social media that if you were attending a meeting, you would say, you know, I'm here.

228
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,801
My name is Janelle Austin.

229
00:25:26,821 --> 00:25:31,904
I'm a resident of 123 Main Street and I'm speaking on my own personal behalf.

230
00:25:32,064 --> 00:25:32,444
Right.

231
00:25:33,004 --> 00:25:33,845
And so I think

232
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:38,838
you don't have to give your address, but I think the equivalent would be something online.

233
00:25:39,418 --> 00:25:48,121
Like I said, if you are speaking about a matter that isn't within your committee's jurisdiction, I think it's a little bit easier.

234
00:25:48,141 --> 00:25:55,544
So if you're commenting about something before the city council or another public body, it's easier.

235
00:25:55,564 --> 00:26:02,067
I think it's a little bit harder to say, oh no, I'm speaking in my individual capacity, but I'm a member of this committee.

236
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:14,466
Again, it is difficult in this day and age, but I'm just, I would be very cognizant to not share opinions amongst a quorum of all of you online.

237
00:26:15,987 --> 00:26:16,827
If that's helpful.

238
00:26:17,487 --> 00:26:17,867
Thank you.

239
00:26:21,949 --> 00:26:23,649
And I think that was all the questions.

240
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:26,350
If you want to move on to public records law, that would be great.

241
00:26:26,891 --> 00:26:27,231
Sure.

242
00:26:27,251 --> 00:26:32,092
And I know the materials that I previously supplied were very detailed.

243
00:26:32,112 --> 00:26:34,153
So I just wanted to touch on a couple of

244
00:26:34,607 --> 00:26:38,309
particular items that I thought were most relevant.

245
00:26:38,909 --> 00:26:52,555
One was, as I mentioned before, the use of private email accounts or private cell phones for text messages does not necessarily take those communications or those records outside of the public records law.

246
00:26:53,155 --> 00:26:56,257
So let me start by saying what the public records law is, is

247
00:26:57,217 --> 00:27:10,088
It's a law that governs both the retention and the scope of records created or received by the city or its officials or volunteers or employees.

248
00:27:10,608 --> 00:27:18,355
So essentially your records in your capacity as members of the committee are subject to the public records law.

249
00:27:19,778 --> 00:27:32,244
If you are using personal email accounts, cell phone numbers, et cetera, personal computers to do work on behalf of the committee, those records would also be subject to the public records law.

250
00:27:33,664 --> 00:27:42,228
And so, you know, I often get the question, well, I sent this email on a Gmail account or I sent this text message on my personal cell phone.

251
00:27:43,368 --> 00:27:53,991
if it relates to municipal business on your, based on the work the committee's doing, in my opinion, if there was a public records request, we would have to ask you for those records.

252
00:27:55,151 --> 00:28:04,054
Now we all use emails and phones all of the time, but I just wanted to flag that for all of you because

253
00:28:04,688 --> 00:28:16,273
You will be a busy committee and certainly, you know, any official business is going to be in your meeting minutes, but just be cognizant of email and text messages as well.

254
00:28:18,114 --> 00:28:24,956
So the public records law will govern your records as well as the open meeting law will govern your meeting minutes.

255
00:28:25,056 --> 00:28:30,959
So that requires that the meeting minutes be timely prepared and approved.

256
00:28:31,489 --> 00:28:35,373
And there, I assume, will be put on the internet for members of the public to see.

257
00:28:35,653 --> 00:28:41,519
So if you received a request for those, we would process that under the open meeting law or the public records law.

258
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:44,261
So I just wanted to identify that for you as well.

259
00:28:45,482 --> 00:28:51,308
Certainly, you know, if you have any specific questions about the public records law, definitely let me know.

260
00:28:52,029 --> 00:28:56,453
There are exceptions to the public records law, which are fairly narrow in scope.

261
00:28:57,502 --> 00:29:13,725
Obviously, items that contain, you know, certain personnel information or attorney-client privilege information, but generally speaking, records created or received by you would be subject to the public records law unless they're otherwise exempt.

262
00:29:15,985 --> 00:29:17,946
Any specific questions on that?

263
00:29:27,749 --> 00:29:30,010
I got one.

264
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:30,110
Sure.

265
00:29:31,651 --> 00:29:54,924
Just for the meeting minutes, which I'm taking right now, and I'm a person that doesn't have the most experience in the world as secretary, but are the meeting minutes supposed to be like more like a transcript, so everything everybody says, or is it supposed to be just like a summary of the key points that were said during a meeting and that's acceptable?

266
00:29:55,881 --> 00:30:00,462
Sure, so they do not need to be a transcript under the open meeting law.

267
00:30:01,522 --> 00:30:11,604
They do need to have certain items and I'll tell you what those are, but it has to have the members present at the meeting, the date, the time of the meeting.

268
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:24,367
I can send you a summary of this if this is helpful, but the date and time of the meeting, the members present or absent, a general discussion of the business that's conducted by the committee,

269
00:30:25,848 --> 00:30:28,289
and a record of all votes taken.

270
00:30:28,829 --> 00:30:31,269
So it does not need to be a transcript.

271
00:30:31,629 --> 00:30:33,670
It also can't be very sparse.

272
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:46,333
It has to basically, I always use the analogy that if you picked up a copy of your meeting minutes and a member of the public was at home and didn't attend the meeting, would they understand what transpired at the meeting?

273
00:30:46,353 --> 00:30:53,295
And if the answer is yes, then they're probably sufficiently detailed, but it doesn't need to be a transcript.

274
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:55,781
if that's helpful.

275
00:31:01,724 --> 00:31:04,345
We have any other questions regarding the public records law?

276
00:31:08,647 --> 00:31:08,927
All right.

277
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:13,669
Are there any other materials you wanted to share with us to know?

278
00:31:13,689 --> 00:31:16,670
I just wanted to touch on I know there were

279
00:31:17,337 --> 00:31:20,480
a conflict of interest training was also conducted.

280
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:26,126
I know that members, you know, understand that they have to complete the State Ethics Commission training.

281
00:31:26,186 --> 00:31:27,968
I don't know if everyone's already done that.

282
00:31:28,488 --> 00:31:30,270
Certainly, that's my recommendation.

283
00:31:31,352 --> 00:31:33,113
Those materials are online.

284
00:31:33,173 --> 00:31:35,514
If you need them, just certainly let me know.

285
00:31:35,594 --> 00:31:38,075
I'd be happy to provide them.

286
00:31:38,955 --> 00:31:43,477
I just wanted to flag two things that I think would come up based on the work of your particular committee.

287
00:31:44,517 --> 00:31:47,378
And this may be something you already know, but I always highlight it.

288
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:50,320
You know, certain gifts are not allowed.

289
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:59,143
Gifts, written disclosures required essentially under the ethics law, if it's related to your office or action.

290
00:31:59,845 --> 00:32:04,208
And it's less than $50 gifts over $50 are not permitted.

291
00:32:04,988 --> 00:32:11,712
There's very specific conflict of interest requirements for members of public bodies.

292
00:32:11,792 --> 00:32:15,815
So I just wanted to, to, to share that with you.

293
00:32:15,995 --> 00:32:24,560
Obviously we want to give, make the, we want to present that there's no appearance of just, you know, impropriety, which of course there isn't.

294
00:32:25,362 --> 00:32:38,425
Um, but certainly we want to just be cognizant that includes food and beverages, um, and other gifts, you know, obviously if there's someone's birthday or it's a friend issue, that's different, but just wanted to flag that for you.

295
00:32:38,445 --> 00:32:48,408
Um, the other thing, and you know, I, I just wanted to identify, cause I get the most questions on the gift issue and also, you know, acting as an agent, so to speak, and that's a

296
00:32:52,129 --> 00:32:55,070
268A, conflict of interest law, section 17 matter.

297
00:32:56,291 --> 00:33:00,773
Essentially, you can't receive money from or act as an agent for someone.

298
00:33:00,793 --> 00:33:10,617
So, if your professional background is an attorney or it is an engineer, for instance, there are some very specific limitations in terms of

299
00:33:11,652 --> 00:33:16,093
presenting or being before the city on other things or representing clients.

300
00:33:17,034 --> 00:33:26,717
So I just wanted to identify those as well, those particular two points to highlight, and then just make sure that everyone knew about the state ethics training as well.

301
00:33:28,117 --> 00:33:33,139
Unfortunately, actually, this is, we had not previously been informed about the state ethics training.

302
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:37,820
So if you could provide those materials to me and Milva, we'll make sure we share that out to the committee.

303
00:33:38,658 --> 00:33:40,159
Okay, I will email those out tomorrow.

304
00:33:41,281 --> 00:33:41,681
Thank you.

305
00:33:42,902 --> 00:33:46,446
Also, if we already finished the state ethics training for something else, we have to take it again.

306
00:33:46,466 --> 00:33:50,289
I think it's every three years is my recollection.

307
00:33:50,309 --> 00:33:53,973
But I can confirm.

308
00:33:58,163 --> 00:34:01,006
Does anybody else have any further questions for Janelle?

309
00:34:01,886 --> 00:34:07,852
I would also just not to backtrack on the open meeting law, but there is the open meeting law certification as well.

310
00:34:07,892 --> 00:34:10,514
I just want to make sure everyone has completed that.

311
00:34:11,054 --> 00:34:13,356
And if you haven't, I can send that along as well.

312
00:34:13,557 --> 00:34:13,777
Yes.

313
00:34:14,397 --> 00:34:18,461
Unfortunately, we have not yet received materials on any training.

314
00:34:18,561 --> 00:34:20,182
So if you could furnish that, that would be great.

315
00:34:20,863 --> 00:34:21,383
Absolutely.

316
00:34:21,444 --> 00:34:21,904
No problem.

317
00:34:25,663 --> 00:34:28,726
Well, thank you so much for your time and for the clarification.

318
00:34:29,006 --> 00:34:30,027
Jean, did you have a question?

319
00:34:30,247 --> 00:34:38,673
Oh, are there forms then that we have to get you Janelle or after the forms are filed with the city clerk's office?

320
00:34:39,474 --> 00:34:42,256
Okay, and which forms are those are you'll send it?

321
00:34:42,276 --> 00:34:50,823
Yep, I will send I will send the certification forms and the instructions in terms of who they need to be returned to.

322
00:34:51,363 --> 00:34:52,024
Okay, that's great.

323
00:34:52,084 --> 00:34:52,404
Thank you.

324
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:53,345
No problem.

325
00:34:59,773 --> 00:35:01,895
All right, thank you again, Janelle.

326
00:35:02,435 --> 00:35:03,836
Thank you all, nice meeting you.

327
00:35:03,956 --> 00:35:05,338
Have a good evening everybody.

328
00:35:05,518 --> 00:35:07,720
Further questions can be helpful, let me know.

329
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,301
Thank you all, happy new year.

330
00:35:09,801 --> 00:35:10,682
Thank you too.

331
00:35:16,026 --> 00:35:25,134
Okay, now we are very excited and grateful to be working with the Collins Center during this process.

332
00:35:26,476 --> 00:35:33,460
We have Anthony Wilson from the Collins Center, Michael Ward, and was Marilyn also coming?

333
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:34,500
She, okay.

334
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,561
That's her phone number.

335
00:35:36,361 --> 00:35:36,682
Okay.

336
00:35:36,942 --> 00:35:37,742
Down in the corner there.

337
00:35:38,463 --> 00:35:38,723
Great.

338
00:35:39,163 --> 00:35:41,925
So I'm going to hand over the program to you.

339
00:35:41,985 --> 00:35:51,170
And I know that you all are interested in connecting with the committee members and you can start your presentation.

340
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:51,770
Thank you.

341
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:53,400
Great.

342
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:59,684
Can you make Anthony a co-host to share his screen?

343
00:35:59,704 --> 00:36:01,205
I already did.

344
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:02,366
Oh, excellent.

345
00:36:02,406 --> 00:36:03,167
Thank you very much.

346
00:36:03,247 --> 00:36:10,552
Well, and thank you to both of you, the co-chairs and to all the members of the committee for the opportunity to work with you.

347
00:36:11,913 --> 00:36:13,594
We are very excited to meet you all.

348
00:36:13,634 --> 00:36:14,995
We're excited to support your work.

349
00:36:16,162 --> 00:36:18,704
As you can see in my name there, my name is Michael Ward.

350
00:36:18,744 --> 00:36:20,866
I'm the director of the Collins Center.

351
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:29,512
I'm also a member of our center's charter team, and we'll be helping a bit of the background and popping in here and there.

352
00:36:29,532 --> 00:36:36,057
I'm not going to be part of the main project team, but I certainly hope to be involved as needed.

353
00:36:36,927 --> 00:36:52,535
With me tonight are two members of the project team that are going to be on this as, as the co-chair mentioned, Anthony Wilson, who will be the team leader, I'll turn it over to in a moment and Marilyn Contreras, who's here, who's on by phone as well.

354
00:36:52,895 --> 00:36:57,677
We've got two more members who will be joining the team at future meetings.

355
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:15,571
We've decided to keep our presentation, uh, brief tonight, um, because we want to, um, have time to answer your questions and also to learn about you and from you that will help us customize, um, uh, our approach to the needs and interests of this committee.

356
00:37:15,591 --> 00:37:22,155
Um, every charter committee, every commission, um, every charter project, it tends to be a little bit different.

357
00:37:22,456 --> 00:37:27,259
And the more we can, uh, understand, um, kind of where you're coming from, the more we can really.

358
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:33,296
Taylor, what we're doing and how we work with you to help you out as much as possible.

359
00:37:34,437 --> 00:37:35,798
So we'll look forward to that at the end.

360
00:37:36,138 --> 00:37:42,261
I'm going to just briefly tell you a bit about the Collins Center and about our charter work, and then I'll turn it over to Anthony.

361
00:37:42,321 --> 00:37:51,367
So first, to get to know a little bit about us, the Collins Center was created back in 2008 by the Patrick administration and the legislature.

362
00:37:51,985 --> 00:37:56,168
We are part of the McCormick Graduate School of Policy and Global Studies at UMass Boston.

363
00:37:56,648 --> 00:38:09,217
We have a mission, a legislatively provided mission, to provide technical assistance to cities, towns, school districts, state agencies, quasi, pretty much any public entity out there on public management topics.

364
00:38:09,257 --> 00:38:13,460
You can think of us a little bit like a consulting organization with a public service mission.

365
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:23,567
In our 14, now pushing 15 years, we have completed over 800 projects, mostly cities and towns, mostly Massachusetts.

366
00:38:23,667 --> 00:38:35,236
We've worked in over two thirds of the 351 cities and towns, including all of the largest cities, as well as several of the smallest, including the town of Gosnold, population 70.

367
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:42,902
Beyond the charter work, our sort of main practice areas include

368
00:38:43,360 --> 00:39:00,095
finance, HR, we do operations work for different departments, we do analytics, we do executive recruitment training, IT, we do some performance management, regionalization, and of course the charter and structure work.

369
00:39:00,616 --> 00:39:00,996
I think it's

370
00:39:02,378 --> 00:39:06,582
important to note that we do have these other practice areas, because they really do inform our charter work.

371
00:39:06,642 --> 00:39:19,773
And if we, if the committee, if we come into a, for example, a deep question about finance, or about HR, we can, that we can't answer within our charter team, we can go beyond to our other HR team, our finance team.

372
00:39:20,653 --> 00:39:24,635
and build further expertise as needed.

373
00:39:25,595 --> 00:39:28,176
So let me just, you know, give you a quick flavor of our charter work.

374
00:39:28,216 --> 00:39:37,220
And actually, I think this is a little, there's a couple of these that need updating or adding to, but you got to just to give you a bit of a flavor here.

375
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,520
I know this is very small text.

376
00:39:39,161 --> 00:39:45,343
We've worked in about 30, on about 30 charter related projects as a center.

377
00:39:46,284 --> 00:39:49,325
It's about 7% of the cities and towns in Massachusetts includes

378
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:54,633
Some major, some of the larger cities, it also includes some small towns, everything in between.

379
00:39:56,494 --> 00:40:12,142
And beyond the Collins Center's list of charter projects, Marilyn, who's with us, and then another member of our team, Steve, who will be joining at future meetings, both have worked on many charter projects in their past lives prior to joining the Collins Center.

380
00:40:12,852 --> 00:40:24,044
In fact, I don't, Marilyn, I always say Marilyn has worked on more charters than anyone else in Massachusetts charters than anyone else in the Commonwealth.

381
00:40:24,885 --> 00:40:34,576
So it's, we really have a lot of experience working with different committees, different size cities, different approaches, different interests.

382
00:40:35,442 --> 00:40:46,669
Um, we currently just so you know, have, uh, active charter projects going, uh, in, um, the cities of Beverly Cambridge in Somerville, um, um, as well as a bunch of, uh, several small towns.

383
00:40:47,730 --> 00:41:00,958
Um, and you know, I obviously am biased, uh, but I believe that the charter work is some of the most critical work we do at the call center, because as you'll find, as you'll hear late in a moment, um, you know, we're.

384
00:41:01,752 --> 00:41:09,174
And as you probably already know that the charter is really setting the foundation for everything in a city and town does it really is at the core.

385
00:41:10,155 --> 00:41:15,716
And, and because of that, you know, I want to take a moment to thank you all for your service on this committee.

386
00:41:16,156 --> 00:41:26,480
We know you're giving up your time, your energy, you know and to be on this, you may at times wonder what you've gotten yourselves into, but it's, it's so important.

387
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,680
It's incredibly important.

388
00:41:28,545 --> 00:41:32,568
for the city, for the community, the work that you are undertaking.

389
00:41:32,588 --> 00:41:53,903
And it's a critical opportunity for the community to step back away from the day-to-day, look at what's working, look at what's not working, and looking at what can be improved so that the city of Medford can continue to provide the best possible services to the community.

390
00:41:55,723 --> 00:42:00,804
So I guess with that, I'm going to, you know, just thank you all again for your service.

391
00:42:02,184 --> 00:42:13,326
And I'm looking forward to hearing more about you and your questions and your interests at the end, but I'm going to turn it over to Senator Associate Anthony Wilson, who's going to take you on a brief tour of charter history in Massachusetts.

392
00:42:13,366 --> 00:42:19,747
And then we're going to talk about the reasons for charter review and the types of things that get reviewed in a charter review.

393
00:42:20,268 --> 00:42:21,148
So thank you.

394
00:42:21,188 --> 00:42:22,368
And Anthony.

395
00:42:23,265 --> 00:42:23,725
Thank you, Mike.

396
00:42:23,745 --> 00:42:30,148
So I'm going to just go through some of the brief history of charters in Massachusetts, how we got where we are today.

397
00:42:30,168 --> 00:42:37,071
And that'll touch on sort of probably why you are in the middle of a charter review now.

398
00:42:37,091 --> 00:42:43,974
So 1821, the Massachusetts Constitution was amended to allow cities with populations of over 12,000 to adopt a city form of government.

399
00:42:44,554 --> 00:42:50,937
In 1915, the legislature codified the law relating to city government offering planned city governments.

400
00:42:51,790 --> 00:43:00,900
That's what we see today as Chapter 43, which provides citizens a citizen petition process to adopt the city form as defined by the state.

401
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:06,025
There are several plans, four were part of the initial statute and two more were added later.

402
00:43:06,045 --> 00:43:09,489
And I'll just go to the next slide.

403
00:43:09,989 --> 00:43:12,232
So this is just some general facts about

404
00:43:12,982 --> 00:43:14,863
the charter situation in Massachusetts.

405
00:43:14,903 --> 00:43:17,384
So no city has adopted a CD or F charter.

406
00:43:18,264 --> 00:43:20,545
The text of each plan is modest.

407
00:43:20,585 --> 00:43:22,866
That's a nice way of saying that they're sparse.

408
00:43:22,886 --> 00:43:26,147
They don't cover all the things that we think about today in a modern charter.

409
00:43:26,707 --> 00:43:31,609
The plans do not enjoy significant popularity.

410
00:43:32,549 --> 00:43:39,112
A lot of cities that did adopt a plan charter have over time modified them or modified them at the time of their adoption.

411
00:43:40,889 --> 00:43:43,332
and modified them through the special act process.

412
00:43:46,448 --> 00:43:49,490
So the process for adopting a plan from a government has been repealed.

413
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:51,391
Oh, excuse me.

414
00:43:51,611 --> 00:43:58,475
With the home rule amendment that was adopted in 1966, the Massachusetts amendment importantly provided for limited home rule.

415
00:43:58,515 --> 00:44:12,142
So as we're gonna find out throughout this process is that communities in Massachusetts have much more power than they did prior to shape a charter in the way that best fits their community.

416
00:44:13,307 --> 00:44:19,309
So this next slide, I'm not gonna read this whole quote, but it's a quote from the National League of Cities.

417
00:44:20,069 --> 00:44:29,352
And essentially what the quote says, and it's very true, is that the charter is the municipal equivalent of a state or national constitution.

418
00:44:29,412 --> 00:44:34,873
So as Mike said, this is the foundation of how your city will be operating moving forward.

419
00:44:36,414 --> 00:44:39,595
So there are five types or five reasons for charter review.

420
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:42,571
They seem pretty self-explanatory.

421
00:44:42,591 --> 00:44:43,651
We're going to go through them a little bit.

422
00:44:43,992 --> 00:45:04,044
The first one is to update your charter to reflect the best practices for municipal governance, to be responsive to the needs of the population, to ensure that the charter is kept consistent with state and federal law, to ensure the charter is consistent with the values and cultural changes, and to clarify any text that has caused confusion or disruption in its interpretation.

423
00:45:08,227 --> 00:45:09,508
So modern charters,

424
00:45:11,451 --> 00:45:18,238
Traditionally include an automatic review process, you can set the time or the time period on under which the review will happen.

425
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:20,381
Usually, it'll be 10 years.

426
00:45:21,402 --> 00:45:30,792
It provides a mechanism for reorganization of departments, again, with time cities may offer more or different services they have in the past, and therefore

427
00:45:31,208 --> 00:45:34,829
Having a flexible way to structure your city is often important.

428
00:45:35,469 --> 00:45:41,431
A capital improvement process plan and reference to electronic and online access information.

429
00:45:41,931 --> 00:45:51,073
As you will have already seen from your conversation with the attorney from Kaplan and Page, there's a lot of conversation about how this new electronic world we live in affects the way that we govern.

430
00:45:54,881 --> 00:46:01,184
So these are just some examples of the areas that these five reasons for charter review impact.

431
00:46:01,685 --> 00:46:11,650
So in regard to responsiveness to the needs of the community, the size and composition of the city council may need to change depending on the size and population of the community.

432
00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:13,851
And as we all know, those things change over time.

433
00:46:14,672 --> 00:46:18,654
And the terms of the mayors, there's been some

434
00:46:19,167 --> 00:46:27,769
There's conversations in some communities about how long should the mayor's term be, depending on how effective they'll be in terms of pushing certain policies or implementations forward.

435
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:33,231
In the area of staying consistent with state law, there've been several changes in HR law.

436
00:46:33,431 --> 00:46:43,874
In fact, just today, there was a, I think the federal government is discussing new policies about non-compete clauses, which could affect municipal government.

437
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:48,335
Procurement law, open meeting law, as you guys had a training on earlier.

438
00:46:50,331 --> 00:46:56,257
And cultural changes, many modern charters no longer use gender pronouns.

439
00:46:58,539 --> 00:47:04,444
Many modern charters have changed the names of committees or boards to, again, reflect the changing gender norms.

440
00:47:04,784 --> 00:47:10,790
So whereas we used to have board of selectmen, I'm sorry, yeah, board of selectmen, we have a select board or other terms of that nature.

441
00:47:16,133 --> 00:47:19,876
and to clarify any text that may have caused confusion or disputes in the past.

442
00:47:20,156 --> 00:47:26,961
Examples can be recall or referendum provisions, as well as defining key terms that are used throughout the charter.

443
00:47:27,301 --> 00:47:45,155
There can often be some confusion when reviewing a charter to see what, perhaps it's the division of power between the branches of government, what are the city council scope authority, what is the mayor's, and there may be confusion around the terms that are used to describe that division of power.

444
00:47:47,655 --> 00:47:54,559
And this is some recent sort of in-depth charter changes that the Cowen Center has done in the past couple of years.

445
00:47:54,579 --> 00:47:59,062
I don't know if Mike or Marilyn, you wanna chime in about anything noteworthy about any of these?

446
00:48:01,284 --> 00:48:04,886
I'll say a few things and then I'd love to hear Marilyn add on as well.

447
00:48:04,926 --> 00:48:07,948
I may not stick exactly totally to the ones on this.

448
00:48:07,988 --> 00:48:13,992
There are a few others we'll talk about that I don't see on here.

449
00:48:14,032 --> 00:48:14,692
We'll start with,

450
00:48:15,269 --> 00:48:27,652
Um, Amherst and Framingham, uh, which changed form of government to, to, from town to city, uh, in, I think, 2017 and 2019 approximate, maybe 2018, somewhere around there.

451
00:48:27,672 --> 00:48:44,696
Um, we also, um, saw some other major changes of the city of Everett about 10 years ago, replaced what was the last bicameral, uh, city council in the, in the state with a, um, a single city council.

452
00:48:45,416 --> 00:48:50,718
Uh, that had their prior, uh, forum had existed for over a hundred years.

453
00:48:50,798 --> 00:48:56,660
I believe, um, more recently, um, we have seen.

454
00:48:56,680 --> 00:49:01,401
Um, Somerville, they try to review committee has finished its process.

455
00:49:01,441 --> 00:49:06,563
It's now passed a new charter to the city council for its review.

456
00:49:06,583 --> 00:49:14,345
Um, and the Somerville new Somerville charter, um, take some steps to modernize, um,

457
00:49:15,915 --> 00:49:20,779
uh, some of those charter was also over a hundred years old, um, was predated the plans.

458
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:28,586
Uh, Cambridge is in process looking at, um, um, they have a plan E form.

459
00:49:28,826 --> 00:49:35,532
They're not sure whether they're going to keep the form or not, but they have decided to move on from the plan E text, even if they keep the form the same.

460
00:49:35,552 --> 00:49:41,277
Um, we recently completed a project with Watertown, which kept the council manager form, but made.

461
00:49:42,452 --> 00:49:51,714
a bunch of modernization type amendments around things like communications, legislative capacities, and so on and so forth.

462
00:49:53,254 --> 00:50:00,736
Marilyn, do you want to talk about any of the other, you know, recent charter changes in the last 10, 15 years?

463
00:50:00,756 --> 00:50:02,596
Sure.

464
00:50:04,057 --> 00:50:10,438
A new report had a plan B charter, so, and moved on to a home rule charter.

465
00:50:11,223 --> 00:50:18,505
And once again, it was a significant modernization exercise, and they did provide a four-year term for the mayor.

466
00:50:20,226 --> 00:50:34,350
North Hampton took its 1888 charter and brought it forward with more modernization, also provided a four-year term for mayor, made some changes in the school committee.

467
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:38,251
And Pitfield was a 1932 charter,

468
00:50:40,728 --> 00:50:44,651
that also focused on the term of the mayor.

469
00:50:45,011 --> 00:51:02,843
And once again, bringing those features that we talked about, such as a capital plan and how to explain the electronic notices and that kind of thing, you know, into the charter.

470
00:51:03,324 --> 00:51:07,787
I think one of the things that we've touched on

471
00:51:09,153 --> 00:51:12,674
is that the charter is your legal foundation.

472
00:51:13,214 --> 00:51:27,717
But it's also another way to think about it is you want someone to be able to pick it up and read an accessible document that basically explains how the government is structured.

473
00:51:29,418 --> 00:51:38,080
And what features are included that continue no matter who is mayor, no matter who is on the council, no matter who's the police chief,

474
00:51:38,642 --> 00:51:41,583
whatever, these are the things that you always want to have.

475
00:51:43,303 --> 00:51:46,444
And that was the point I wanted to make.

476
00:51:47,645 --> 00:51:48,185
Thank you, Marilyn.

477
00:51:49,125 --> 00:51:50,505
And Matthew, I see your hand raised.

478
00:51:53,226 --> 00:51:58,048
Yes, I'm not sure if I was supposed to wait till the end, but this seems like a good slide to ask my question.

479
00:51:58,108 --> 00:52:02,609
So you mentioned the city council reviewing these charter changes.

480
00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:05,990
Can you talk about

481
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:22,436
the tendency of the city council and these other towns to approve the recommended changes of the charter study committee and if there has been trouble in that how much

482
00:52:23,828 --> 00:52:31,051
it came into discussions as to like the likelihood of the city council to approve whatever changes we gave.

483
00:52:31,891 --> 00:52:35,633
So Matthew, I'm just going to put a pin in there because it's it's we kind of touch on that in the next slides.

484
00:52:35,653 --> 00:52:37,153
So I'm going to come back to it.

485
00:52:37,173 --> 00:52:38,354
We're just going to go through the next slides.

486
00:52:38,394 --> 00:52:40,275
And it's I promise you it's folded in there.

487
00:52:40,795 --> 00:52:41,335
Yep.

488
00:52:41,935 --> 00:52:47,718
So pathways to revisions of a new charter.

489
00:52:48,218 --> 00:52:48,338
So

490
00:52:49,578 --> 00:52:55,345
Home Rule, as we discussed earlier, the Home Rule Amendment, Chapter 40, spelled out in Chapter 43B.

491
00:52:55,706 --> 00:52:57,809
There's also the Special Act Charter route.

492
00:53:00,793 --> 00:53:06,180
Flexible, different time standards, and the charter revision process, which

493
00:53:07,275 --> 00:53:11,218
It sounds like Medford could be in the midst of Marilyn.

494
00:53:11,299 --> 00:53:12,219
Do you want to say anything?

495
00:53:12,259 --> 00:53:14,521
Maybe, maybe explain a little bit more about these.

496
00:53:14,561 --> 00:53:16,883
This may, you may be able to answer a little bit more about that.

497
00:53:17,324 --> 00:53:20,687
City council question talking about these three, that's to adoption.

498
00:53:21,708 --> 00:53:21,948
Sure.

499
00:53:22,048 --> 00:53:33,458
Your, your committee is going to present a set of recommendations to the, to the city council and the city council will review that and

500
00:53:35,477 --> 00:53:37,258
determine what they like and don't like.

501
00:53:38,139 --> 00:53:43,162
In answer to your question, yes, some of these things do not go forward.

502
00:53:45,863 --> 00:53:56,910
And in terms of the ones that we've worked on, I can think of a couple that died in the city council.

503
00:53:57,571 --> 00:54:02,594
You have to be aware of what will draw the city council's attention.

504
00:54:06,712 --> 00:54:35,065
We do have examples where contentious issues were kind of set aside, and a lot of the modernization changes were made, such as, like I said, the electronic notice, the capital plan, a standard budget-making process, but they didn't want to change the term of the mayor, that kind of thing.

505
00:54:37,546 --> 00:54:48,969
And it's also important to remember that once the city council approves it by majority vote, it must be approved by the mayor before it can go to the state legislature.

506
00:54:50,789 --> 00:54:57,630
So you've got two, you've got two sort of vaults to go over.

507
00:54:57,650 --> 00:55:04,852
And then Marilyn, you just referred to the third, the third one, which if the charter is,

508
00:55:06,278 --> 00:55:12,243
does not include anything that hasn't, you know, that's out of the ordinary.

509
00:55:14,225 --> 00:55:20,950
The legislature is likely to push it through on its own timeline, but it's likely to push it through.

510
00:55:22,371 --> 00:55:28,476
If the committee starts to, you know, look at doing things that have not been done before,

511
00:55:29,397 --> 00:55:43,222
that will probably draw some attention to legislation, not saying that they'll reject it or ignore it, but it will certainly draw more attention and more discussion than it would if it was a pretty standard charter.

512
00:55:43,623 --> 00:55:45,163
So your question is a great one.

513
00:55:45,363 --> 00:55:57,648
And I'm glad you've asked it early because it's something that the committee probably should be grappling with as individual committee members and as a committee throughout this is, you know,

514
00:55:59,165 --> 00:56:02,767
there's the, what do we think as a committee is the ideal optimal charter?

515
00:56:02,887 --> 00:56:12,671
And then there's, you know, what, what can, what do we think is, is an improvement that we think is, is going to be acceptable to the majority of players.

516
00:56:12,871 --> 00:56:17,533
And, and then of course, the last stop in all of this is the, is the ballot box.

517
00:56:18,554 --> 00:56:28,538
And so, so the committee, you know, we'll have to, you know, keep that in mind as well, that the voters will, will get the final say at whatever is put forward.

518
00:56:29,255 --> 00:56:39,061
So I know it may feel like that, then you there's, there's a lot of steps and there's a lot of hurdles, but at the same time, the committee, you know, it has some political clout.

519
00:56:39,101 --> 00:56:43,843
You've been, you are residents who have been appointed for your perspectives and expertise.

520
00:56:44,684 --> 00:56:53,289
And so, you know, crafting something and presenting that to the councils will carry some weight and, and, and shouldn't be discounted.

521
00:56:53,749 --> 00:56:55,030
So it's a great question.

522
00:56:55,050 --> 00:56:56,431
I'm glad you asked it.

523
00:56:56,751 --> 00:56:57,911
We don't have a clear answer.

524
00:56:57,931 --> 00:56:58,692
There are examples.

525
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:05,404
as Marilyn said, that we've seen where a council has sat on it or not moved it forward.

526
00:57:05,684 --> 00:57:11,967
But there are also many examples where they have obviously moved forward what has come out of a committee like yours.

527
00:57:13,768 --> 00:57:21,333
Yeah, and just to add to that, committee members have already sort of alluded to this during their questions to Kaplan and Page about conversations on social media.

528
00:57:22,571 --> 00:57:42,966
The committee probably does want to have a thoughtful consideration about how it does bring in viewpoints and perspectives from other members of the community that aren't on the committee that will help to shape a strong proposal that reduces the likelihood of rejection at the various points in the process that it has to go through to ultimately be enacted.

529
00:57:44,988 --> 00:57:47,169
So that's the end of our presentation.

530
00:57:47,189 --> 00:57:49,451
We're going to open up to the committee for questions.

531
00:57:49,471 --> 00:57:50,612
I would like to start with,

532
00:57:52,465 --> 00:57:55,029
It helps our team to work better to know who it is that we're working with.

533
00:57:55,049 --> 00:57:57,252
So we'd love an introduction from the committee members.

534
00:57:57,853 --> 00:58:08,728
And if anyone has any thoughts about what they're looking to get out of this process or how they'd like to see it progress, that will help us in advising you even at this early stage.

535
00:58:09,188 --> 00:58:09,449
Thank you.

536
00:58:20,303 --> 00:58:22,445
I'm turning it back over to the chairs.

537
00:58:22,626 --> 00:58:26,770
Does anybody do you want us to just sort of introduce ourselves to start with?

538
00:58:27,571 --> 00:58:28,492
That that would be great.

539
00:58:28,532 --> 00:58:34,499
Yeah, if you could, you know, introduce yourselves and and and, you know, relevant, you know, background

540
00:58:35,362 --> 00:58:35,802
Of course.

541
00:58:36,003 --> 00:59:03,003
And then we'd love to hear, you know, what's on your mind, whether there's a question for us about something we said, whether it's a question for us about something we didn't say, whether it's a thought you've got about, it's been in the back of your mind about Med, you know, a question about Medford's charter, an issue that's been bothering you, whatever it is, you know, the more we hear the better we can start to think about, okay, well, how can we, you know, work with, with the committee to, to craft a process that that's going to be most effective for you.

542
00:59:03,898 --> 00:59:04,218
Awesome.

543
00:59:04,438 --> 00:59:04,698
Okay.

544
00:59:04,858 --> 00:59:14,582
I'll start and then I'll call each committee member and invite you to introduce yourself and comment on some of the things Michael mentioned.

545
00:59:15,222 --> 00:59:16,202
I'm Melva McDonald.

546
00:59:16,262 --> 00:59:17,463
I'm one of the co-chairs.

547
00:59:18,883 --> 00:59:27,046
I've been hearing about charter review in Medford for several years and started to get involved in trying to get a review to happen.

548
00:59:28,742 --> 00:59:34,864
uh, about a year ago and it's taken, it's taken a while just to get this committee up and going.

549
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:36,244
So I'm really excited about it.

550
00:59:37,125 --> 00:59:48,288
Um, I think for me, the fundamental issue is what Michael and Anthony and others have alluded to about the charter sort of being the core document that guides the city.

551
00:59:48,308 --> 00:59:56,410
Um, and that's my main reason for being interested, um, in, in looking at it and updating it and.

552
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:59,041
seeing what would work best for Medford.

553
01:00:00,202 --> 01:00:02,443
So, and Laurel, do you wanna go next?

554
01:00:02,463 --> 01:00:07,666
Sure, so I'm Laurel Siegel and I'm co-chair with Milva.

555
01:00:08,966 --> 01:00:18,531
And like Milva, I've been part of a resident group that has been working to raise the question of charter review on the city for some time.

556
01:00:20,338 --> 01:00:24,340
And yeah, really it's just a matter of taking a closer look at what we've got.

557
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:30,343
We know that we have a very basic document that's not as expansive as many other municipalities.

558
01:00:31,023 --> 01:00:32,444
And it's also 40 years old.

559
01:00:33,204 --> 01:00:39,568
So, you know, taking a closer look with the eyes of the current times and what makes most sense for our city.

560
01:00:43,229 --> 01:00:44,650
Great, thanks.

561
01:00:45,731 --> 01:00:47,311
Anthony, do you wanna go next?

562
01:00:48,652 --> 01:00:50,252
Hi, I'm Anthony Andreodola.

563
01:00:51,413 --> 01:00:53,833
By profession, I'm a mental health counselor.

564
01:00:54,454 --> 01:00:58,655
I've been a longtime Method resident, been here more than 50 years.

565
01:00:58,815 --> 01:01:02,856
I'm interested in helping our city move forward.

566
01:01:03,416 --> 01:01:09,397
I remember before we had an elected mayor and how we functioned in the past.

567
01:01:09,558 --> 01:01:12,298
And I see a city that's

568
01:01:15,887 --> 01:01:17,068
and in need of change.

569
01:01:17,208 --> 01:01:21,469
And I want to do whatever I can to kind of help that process move along.

570
01:01:21,490 --> 01:01:23,230
I did have a question.

571
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:31,554
You know, this, the city has been talking about a charter for a number of years, charter review for a number of years now.

572
01:01:31,614 --> 01:01:45,560
And I know the last two times that we as a city tried to get this charter review going, it was turned down by the legislature because

573
01:01:46,341 --> 01:01:51,165
there wasn't a super majority of the city council in favor of it.

574
01:01:51,905 --> 01:02:04,754
Is that still the case where we need to get five votes on the city council to move this forward or would it just be enough to get a majority?

575
01:02:06,015 --> 01:02:08,137
That's something that concerns me.

576
01:02:10,959 --> 01:02:15,182
And with next year being an election year, is this going to,

577
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:32,987
go past this election, or is it something that we need to kind of address quickly, or is it something that will kind of go on, you know, for years before we, you know, finally have a decision one way or the other?

578
01:02:36,409 --> 01:02:44,512
I'll take the last part of that, and then maybe pass over to Marilyn on the city council majority, super majority piece.

579
01:02:45,465 --> 01:02:52,792
Um, you know, the timeline, um, you know, is really at the discretion of the committee.

580
01:02:52,812 --> 01:03:01,780
Um, uh, you know, within whatever constraints you've been given from your mandate, um, from the, um, from the city.

581
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:06,544
Um, however, there obviously are, um,

582
01:03:07,593 --> 01:03:30,072
external timeline constraints, if you were to say, if you wanted, if you wanted to put something on the ballot in November, that is an extremely challenging timeline at this point in time, certainly, or at least for something, you know, at least for a major change, maybe for minor changes, it's still, you know, still

583
01:03:31,110 --> 01:03:31,670
still doable.

584
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:38,934
But if you're talking, you know, really significant things, you're going to need a lot, a lot more, potentially more time.

585
01:03:40,415 --> 01:03:46,157
And that's because, you know, if you back it out to get it on the ballot, it has to go to the clerk in a certain amount of time.

586
01:03:46,177 --> 01:03:49,239
And before that, you know, the

587
01:03:49,798 --> 01:03:51,399
It has to go to the legislature, the governor.

588
01:03:51,439 --> 01:03:53,539
Before that, it has to go to the mayor and the council.

589
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:56,360
And before that, you have to finish your work.

590
01:03:56,900 --> 01:04:04,283
So there's a lot of steps that would have to be compressed into between now and November if you wanted to put something on the November ballot.

591
01:04:04,543 --> 01:04:07,804
Not saying you can't, just saying it would be tricky.

592
01:04:09,684 --> 01:04:17,347
Beyond that though, it is really up to the committee, how fast or slow, how big or small you all want to move.

593
01:04:18,052 --> 01:04:21,535
Marilyn, do you want to take a swing at the majority super majority question?

594
01:04:22,775 --> 01:04:23,016
Sure.

595
01:04:23,036 --> 01:04:27,419
The law requires a majority.

596
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:32,702
The legislature likes to see more than that.

597
01:04:35,164 --> 01:04:44,811
So I think, you know, if it was five to two, I think that they would take it up, but four to three would make them uncomfortable.

598
01:04:46,452 --> 01:04:46,672
And

599
01:04:48,907 --> 01:04:57,493
in terms of is this really what the city wants if three people don't think it is, three elected officials don't think it is.

600
01:04:59,494 --> 01:05:06,619
So that's my sense of it from watching this process for decades.

601
01:05:09,593 --> 01:05:19,521
This might be a good point to just pop in this slightly tangential bit of information here, but worth keeping in the back of your minds.

602
01:05:20,302 --> 01:05:24,505
As Anthony noted in one of the slides, there are two pathways to a charter review.

603
01:05:25,386 --> 01:05:36,395
The way you've been talking about tonight, the way this committee would most naturally follow would be the special act route, wherein after the committee completes its work, it goes to the council, the council mayor, you know,

604
01:05:37,385 --> 01:05:43,308
put forward a home rule petitions, the legislature for a new charter or amended charter.

605
01:05:44,108 --> 01:05:46,690
It goes to the legislature, the governor and back to the voters.

606
01:05:47,070 --> 01:05:48,371
That's all one pathway.

607
01:05:48,971 --> 01:06:01,097
There is a distinct pathway, which we mentioned briefly, the charter commission route spelled out in chapter 43B, which circumvents the council and mayor.

608
01:06:01,877 --> 01:06:04,458
They don't have a role in it and circumvents the legislature.

609
01:06:06,408 --> 01:06:07,850
It's an elected charter commission.

610
01:06:07,870 --> 01:06:24,487
It has to follow very specific steps that are laid out in the general laws, but it is an alternative pathway to get to a charter that is provided

611
01:06:25,612 --> 01:06:37,503
In the situation where people are frustrated with something about their form of government and they don't for one of the steps in the special act processes is, is, uh, they can't get around.

612
01:06:38,024 --> 01:06:39,825
So it's a long process.

613
01:06:40,066 --> 01:06:44,330
It's a complicated process, but it's worth just tucking in the back of your head.

614
01:06:44,350 --> 01:06:45,911
It does not the primary one.

615
01:06:46,432 --> 01:06:50,696
That I believe this committee to be on, but you should be aware of its existence.

616
01:06:51,923 --> 01:06:55,444
And we have an explainer which we can send to the committee after this meeting.

617
01:06:55,464 --> 01:07:01,905
I believe it's originally from the state, which explains the two pathways in detail, and the one that Mike was just talking about.

618
01:07:03,065 --> 01:07:07,166
It involves gathering signatures, it's a whole process.

619
01:07:10,107 --> 01:07:10,807
Great, thank you.

620
01:07:10,827 --> 01:07:13,187
Mike, do you want to go next?

621
01:07:16,419 --> 01:07:20,663
Thank you, uh, no, but thank you, Anthony, Michael, and Marilyn for your time.

622
01:07:21,023 --> 01:07:21,884
Um, we really appreciate it.

623
01:07:21,904 --> 01:07:22,704
I think I speak for everyone.

624
01:07:22,744 --> 01:07:27,248
I say that, um, I'm the, uh, by day I'm the budget director in Somerville.

625
01:07:27,768 --> 01:07:32,252
So this is a process, um, uh, about which I am a little bit familiar.

626
01:07:32,272 --> 01:07:40,099
I've been involved in the charter review, especially with respect to the, the CIP and the sort of the role of finance and things like that.

627
01:07:40,119 --> 01:07:40,159
Um,

628
01:07:41,508 --> 01:07:45,989
I'm relatively, you know, compared to the rest of the group, probably I'm very new to Medford.

629
01:07:47,329 --> 01:08:00,532
So what's important to me as a newer resident here, at least in this process, specifically kind of like, you know, what extent do we want to hear from the mayor, from the council?

630
01:08:00,973 --> 01:08:02,673
Can we hear from the mayor and the council?

631
01:08:03,392 --> 01:08:07,874
or are we simply negotiating with ourselves to find out sort of what can or cannot pass?

632
01:08:08,775 --> 01:08:15,618
I think I come at this from obviously like an administrative good governance bias, right?

633
01:08:15,658 --> 01:08:16,819
Just because of my day job.

634
01:08:17,499 --> 01:08:31,246
And I wanna find out what relevant comparisons in terms of size, scope of government there are between like Medford and the surrounding communities I'm not interested in.

635
01:08:32,211 --> 01:08:34,732
In reinventing the wheel here, there's best practices.

636
01:08:34,772 --> 01:08:37,354
We're not the first ones to do this.

637
01:08:37,414 --> 01:08:42,736
So trying to figure out what's worked in other places and what have been pain points.

638
01:08:42,996 --> 01:08:51,101
And then really trying to strike the middle ground between flexibility and creating strong guardrails.

639
01:08:52,301 --> 01:08:56,783
I think at the end of the day, well, I'll leave it there.

640
01:08:57,004 --> 01:08:57,324
Thank you.

641
01:09:00,545 --> 01:09:00,765
Great.

642
01:09:02,589 --> 01:09:03,549
Marilyn or Mike.

643
01:09:04,210 --> 01:09:04,370
Yeah.

644
01:09:04,410 --> 01:09:06,450
Can I speak to that a little bit?

645
01:09:08,731 --> 01:09:30,878
I think one of the considerations for the committee is, is having some sort of public forum and inviting the mayor and, and the counselors, um, to testify if they want and, and to say,

646
01:09:31,372 --> 01:09:34,953
If you can't come, you know, we'll accept written testimony until X date.

647
01:09:37,174 --> 01:09:41,256
That was done in one of the communities that I'm now working in.

648
01:09:42,176 --> 01:09:56,102
And it was a very successful process in the sense that the committee learned a lot and they took some of those comments and concerns into consideration in what they finally proposed to the council.

649
01:09:59,365 --> 01:10:02,187
So that is an avenue that is available to you.

650
01:10:02,227 --> 01:10:04,929
And I think it can be a valuable one.

651
01:10:08,472 --> 01:10:09,713
Great, thank you.

652
01:10:09,733 --> 01:10:15,917
Okay, Maury, would you like to introduce yourself?

653
01:10:15,937 --> 01:10:19,900
Hi, thank you for having me, everyone.

654
01:10:19,940 --> 01:10:21,381
My name is Maury Terrell.

655
01:10:22,322 --> 01:10:24,444
I'm a lifelong resident of the city of Medford.

656
01:10:24,524 --> 01:10:26,265
I'm president of the Chamber of Commerce.

657
01:10:27,503 --> 01:10:31,646
Our family's been in the city since the 1800s with various businesses.

658
01:10:33,367 --> 01:10:37,830
Obviously, there's quite an attachment between myself to the city.

659
01:10:37,850 --> 01:10:52,720
I was on the outside looking in on the previous charter review, like Laurel said 40 years ago, when we went from a plan E type of government to the strong mayor government that we have today.

660
01:10:55,980 --> 01:11:15,040
You know, I've listened to everything, what everyone has to say tonight, and knowing the sentiment through the existing city council that's there right now, we've got our hands full, because when you talk charter review to any of these existing polls, I'll say with the exception of the mayor,

661
01:11:16,473 --> 01:11:24,020
They're nervous, they don't want to say anything about it, they're afraid of whatever we may come back with, and no one's come back with anything, and they're already saying no.

662
01:11:24,601 --> 01:11:32,749
So, I mean, it's kind of, it's really fascinating to me because you put it to them and you say, well, what are you afraid of?

663
01:11:32,989 --> 01:11:34,410
Well, you better not do this, do that.

664
01:11:34,971 --> 01:11:35,791
We haven't done nothing.

665
01:11:36,682 --> 01:11:49,206
You know, all you're doing is reviewing our charter, that's all, which is the right of the citizens of a city of 58 to 60,000 people that hasn't had a review in 40 years, and that's all we're doing.

666
01:11:49,586 --> 01:12:05,432
No one's suggesting anything here, but you would think that you were gonna throw them out, you know, into the ocean to be on their own, and it's just, it's very unnerving, you know, and I'm happy that the mayor

667
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:12,944
sees the advantage, and all I want to do is hear what our possible changes could be.

668
01:12:13,924 --> 01:12:15,165
Maybe everybody likes everything.

669
01:12:15,905 --> 01:12:18,066
Maybe they want a little change here or a change there.

670
01:12:18,266 --> 01:12:18,747
Who knows?

671
01:12:19,347 --> 01:12:26,751
But I'm glad we have the opportunity and I'm very happy to be part of it and move forward from here.

672
01:12:29,552 --> 01:12:29,872
Great.

673
01:12:30,373 --> 01:12:33,194
Thanks, Maury.

674
01:12:33,694 --> 01:12:34,735
Matt, do you want to go?

675
01:12:36,803 --> 01:12:37,544
I'm Matt Lemming.

676
01:12:38,264 --> 01:12:47,673
I'm a postdoc over at Massachusetts General Hospital where I work in deep learning for neuroimaging diagnostics.

677
01:12:48,594 --> 01:12:57,161
I was involved in the same group as Melvin, Laurel, and a few other people on this committee as well.

678
01:12:57,201 --> 01:13:00,184
That was a citizen's advocacy group for charter review.

679
01:13:01,327 --> 01:13:08,089
I'm interested in charter review because it's the political foundation of this entire city.

680
01:13:08,709 --> 01:13:12,690
And I would like to see a lot of changes happen in this city.

681
01:13:13,330 --> 01:13:17,111
And the charter review seems like the most fundamental one.

682
01:13:17,171 --> 01:13:22,112
So I do have an interest in seeing that happen.

683
01:13:22,132 --> 01:13:26,213
And this committee seems like the best hope of getting that done.

684
01:13:27,433 --> 01:13:29,954
What's on my mind is sort of,

685
01:13:31,914 --> 01:13:50,902
Going off of the question that I asked earlier and what Maury just said, I do know that some city councilors are nervous, just about the idea of this and I would say, you know,

686
01:13:52,823 --> 01:13:54,164
perhaps needlessly so.

687
01:13:54,244 --> 01:14:11,836
But what I would be interested in hearing is just a little bit more about the experiences of doing this in other towns, specifically, which issues brought contention from the city councilors and the mayors that later approved it.

688
01:14:11,856 --> 01:14:12,917
I heard you say that the

689
01:14:13,542 --> 01:14:15,444
Mayor term limits were rejected.

690
01:14:15,464 --> 01:14:21,809
And that makes sense why, you know, they wouldn't want that kind of a change.

691
01:14:21,869 --> 01:14:33,338
But what I'm thinking is like what other issues were sort of hot button things that brought contention from the city council in the past, as well as some strategies for combating those.

692
01:14:33,378 --> 01:14:39,343
And you already said some strategies like the public forum with mayor and councilors invited, that was great.

693
01:14:41,190 --> 01:14:44,252
But yeah, that's what's on my mind right now.

694
01:14:46,814 --> 01:14:47,435
Thanks, Matt.

695
01:14:52,018 --> 01:14:54,440
OK, Jean.

696
01:14:58,543 --> 01:14:59,043
Hello.

697
01:15:00,344 --> 01:15:01,645
Thanks for presenting today.

698
01:15:01,665 --> 01:15:05,528
And I'm Jean Zotter.

699
01:15:05,728 --> 01:15:07,150
I have a law degree.

700
01:15:07,470 --> 01:15:09,731
I worked as a public interest attorney for

701
01:15:11,012 --> 01:15:16,695
10 years and then was in state government working on public health policy, and now I'm a consultant.

702
01:15:19,477 --> 01:15:33,645
I'm interested in having an effective city government that is transparent and engaged with residents and is representative.

703
01:15:33,725 --> 01:15:38,908
We're a diverse city, yet we haven't really had diverse elected officials.

704
01:15:40,422 --> 01:15:46,144
I would like to find a way where our government can be more responsive and more representative of the city.

705
01:15:48,946 --> 01:16:01,071
My question for you is, I'm hoping that you'll, you went through the slides pretty fast and I saw that the different plans, and I'm hoping you'll give us a more specific grounding and what all the options are.

706
01:16:01,091 --> 01:16:06,773
And are we stuck with, my understanding is we're stuck with whatever

707
01:16:07,273 --> 01:16:09,815
those options are we can't go outside of it.

708
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:15,038
So that's one thing I'm curious to understand is like, what are our options are?

709
01:16:15,058 --> 01:16:20,721
Yeah, Michael's just gonna say we don't, you're not stuck with the plans.

710
01:16:20,761 --> 01:16:22,922
And I think the trend is to move away from the plans.

711
01:16:22,983 --> 01:16:25,304
And maybe Mike and Marilyn can explain that.

712
01:16:26,237 --> 01:16:37,437
Yeah, the, the, there are only 12 cities left that have planned forms including Medford modern charters are have moved away from them have been are drafted from scratch.

713
01:16:37,847 --> 01:16:44,672
There is the limitation of the, there in Massachusetts, sort of four basic forms of government available.

714
01:16:44,953 --> 01:16:48,275
Now within each, there's a lot of variability and a lot of permutations.

715
01:16:48,355 --> 01:16:50,918
And so there's a lot of ways to customize them.

716
01:16:51,558 --> 01:17:01,346
Of course, that's why, I mean, that's what a lot of the work is, but the, you know, four basic at the highest level forms, you have the mayor council form, which you have the council manager form,

717
01:17:02,191 --> 01:17:12,604
You have open town meeting and representative town meeting and we will get in, you know, we'll do a presentation of will maybe less on the towns we can probably I assume.

718
01:17:13,507 --> 01:17:27,573
I assume we can skip over that and focus on the two city forums and what the variations are within each, talk about the examples that there are, and walk you through some example charters of each forum, assuming you want each forum.

719
01:17:27,613 --> 01:17:32,055
I mean, if you know you're continuing with this forum, then we can just go into examples of that.

720
01:17:32,475 --> 01:17:33,955
That's fine, however you want to proceed.

721
01:17:34,456 --> 01:17:43,938
But absolutely, we'll give you examples of what the options are and, you know, answer any questions as we go through them.

722
01:17:47,039 --> 01:17:47,319
Great.

723
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:48,660
Thank you.

724
01:17:49,980 --> 01:17:50,300
John.

725
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:59,003
Hi, I'm John Moreshi, and I assure you, I have to pay attention on my daughter's in the other room and she keeps running around.

726
01:18:00,568 --> 01:18:01,028
But thank you.

727
01:18:01,449 --> 01:18:02,470
So my name is John Rushy.

728
01:18:02,690 --> 01:18:05,492
I am currently first assistant town council to the town of Brookline.

729
01:18:05,892 --> 01:18:08,935
And up until a few months ago, I was deputy council to the Massachusetts Senate.

730
01:18:08,955 --> 01:18:15,320
So I have a lot of charter experience, but always in mechanics and law, I'm really excited to engage in the substance of it.

731
01:18:16,461 --> 01:18:24,187
One issue that I'm particularly interested in, I'm wondering if you could help a little bit, I think this is probably what Maureen that we're alluding to a little bit is we elect our counselors at large.

732
01:18:24,728 --> 01:18:29,612
And I know Lowell had an issue with that a few years ago entering into their consent decree.

733
01:18:30,427 --> 01:18:37,309
And so I guess I'm curious, would you be able to provide data on proportionality of representation as it stands now?

734
01:18:37,329 --> 01:18:45,331
Because I would guess that where we're at large, our council makeup is probably not as representative of the city as it would be if we're award-based.

735
01:18:46,151 --> 01:18:49,032
And yeah, that's my question.

736
01:18:49,052 --> 01:18:57,114
I look forward to working with you.

737
01:18:57,134 --> 01:18:58,555
Yeah, we can certainly get into

738
01:19:00,659 --> 01:19:06,981
the at-large versus ward, the balances between them.

739
01:19:08,841 --> 01:19:23,765
And yes, you're right, Lowell, under consent decree from the federal government, moved to add, I think it was consent decree, but moved to add districts about two years ago, a year ago, where previously they were all at-large.

740
01:19:25,368 --> 01:19:32,632
and we can look at some of the data around other comparable cities and see what they look like.

741
01:19:32,652 --> 01:19:38,855
That was also true in Springfield and in Everett.

742
01:19:39,455 --> 01:19:41,876
There was a finding in Springfield.

743
01:19:41,936 --> 01:19:49,820
I think Everett took action because they were warned there would be a finding in terms of violations of the Voting Rights Act.

744
01:19:54,407 --> 01:19:55,888
Great, thank you.

745
01:19:56,468 --> 01:19:56,869
Ron.

746
01:19:58,750 --> 01:20:09,056
Thanks, I'm Ron Chivino, lifelong Medford citizen, and I'm retired now, but I have five Medford grandchildren, so I'm fully invested in the future here.

747
01:20:09,076 --> 01:20:20,824
To Marilyn's point, I think one of the best things we can do is provide for a wide open forum, so the public gets to see and have full input.

748
01:20:21,985 --> 01:20:26,886
I would like to see obviously after 40 years, it's time for more than just a review.

749
01:20:28,306 --> 01:20:36,528
My goal is to see that, you know, roles are defined in city government so that there's no ambiguity, there's no room for interpretation.

750
01:20:36,548 --> 01:20:40,549
I also think that we need to look at the balance of power.

751
01:20:41,149 --> 01:20:47,890
I think we also need to encourage one arm of government to communicate with the other.

752
01:20:48,807 --> 01:20:54,171
And however that works out is great, but I think those are the things that we should focus on.

753
01:20:54,831 --> 01:21:00,315
My question to you all is that there's a big temptation to go look at other charters.

754
01:21:01,176 --> 01:21:02,837
You can get them online pretty easily.

755
01:21:03,277 --> 01:21:14,899
My question to you is, if I looked at the Collins Center projects, charter projects now, would I see a common thread amongst them all?

756
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:21,561
Or are they absolutely unique to each form of government that each city and town that you work at?

757
01:21:23,441 --> 01:21:24,561
They're pretty unique.

758
01:21:24,601 --> 01:21:27,062
There are certainly some common themes that run through them.

759
01:21:28,542 --> 01:21:31,683
But, you know, we've worked with towns that

760
01:21:32,595 --> 01:21:33,736
only made small changes.

761
01:21:33,776 --> 01:21:36,237
We've worked with towns that converted to cities.

762
01:21:36,317 --> 01:21:43,701
We've worked with cities that have made all different kinds of changes.

763
01:21:43,721 --> 01:21:49,924
There are certain best practices that we do encourage, and Anthony provided some examples.

764
01:21:50,724 --> 01:21:58,808
First and foremost is the 10-year charter review itself, which older charters lack, and therefore you get into situations where it goes a long time.

765
01:21:59,285 --> 01:22:04,107
So I would be willing to bet every charter we've worked on has a 10-year review built in.

766
01:22:04,207 --> 01:22:23,115
So I guess I would say on more, I don't know, mundane's not the word, but on more practical, on more administrative type issues, you will see pretty common themes and threads and language that we recommend.

767
01:22:23,951 --> 01:22:25,373
particularly where it's highly technical.

768
01:22:25,754 --> 01:22:31,365
For example, the processes for recall referendum initiative and so forth.

769
01:22:34,333 --> 01:22:38,176
we encourage you to use a set language that has been vetted and approved.

770
01:22:38,716 --> 01:22:40,698
You can change the thresholds.

771
01:22:40,918 --> 01:22:47,644
That's up to the committee entirely, what percent of voters, number of voters, how long, all that stuff.

772
01:22:47,984 --> 01:22:59,634
But in terms of the actual process, the language, we strongly encourage places to use the same because it's been vetted and it's so complicated that it's easy to mess up if you kind of wander off a bit.

773
01:23:00,074 --> 01:23:02,775
So I guess that's a long-winded answer to your question.

774
01:23:02,795 --> 01:23:14,417
You'll see common themes, some best practices, but around the big picture stuff, that's driven by the committee, driven by the community, driven by where you all want to go.

775
01:23:14,437 --> 01:23:16,938
Thank you.

776
01:23:18,478 --> 01:23:23,539
And if you do go online, I mean, you're going to see a lot of charters in a very standard format.

777
01:23:26,899 --> 01:23:37,144
that there are charter articles, usually referred to as charter articles, sometimes referred to as chapters, but they pretty much follow the same kind of table of contents.

778
01:23:41,426 --> 01:23:45,268
So if you say I read this before, yeah, you did.

779
01:23:45,288 --> 01:23:48,910
Thank you.

780
01:23:49,970 --> 01:23:50,410
Thank you.

781
01:23:50,811 --> 01:23:51,471
Okay, Eunice.

782
01:23:57,826 --> 01:23:59,788
Okay, Eunice Brown.

783
01:24:00,509 --> 01:24:03,631
I'm also a lifelong Medford resident.

784
01:24:04,352 --> 01:24:12,079
I have been watching local political meetings for probably 25 ish years.

785
01:24:12,099 --> 01:24:21,488
And particularly recently in the last, I don't know, three, four or five years, I've been watching

786
01:24:22,382 --> 01:24:36,591
pretty much every city council meeting, every school committee meeting, and a whole bunch of subcommittee meetings, city council, committee of the whole meetings, board and commission meetings, and so forth.

787
01:24:36,611 --> 01:24:44,776
So I've had an opportunity to really see what our elected officials are doing.

788
01:24:45,616 --> 01:24:51,220
And I have sort of tuned into

789
01:24:53,347 --> 01:25:01,612
ways where we're ineffective, inefficient, not transparent, or just falling short, I think, in places.

790
01:25:02,372 --> 01:25:21,163
And I'm going to be very interested as we go through to find out what can be included in a charter to make us better in a whole lot of ways, as Ron alluded to.

791
01:25:21,681 --> 01:25:34,452
to see our bodies work better together, to ensure better public participation on our bodies in a variety of ways.

792
01:25:35,873 --> 01:25:44,420
I recently came across an instance, something that I would like to see changed or at least addressed.

793
01:25:45,962 --> 01:25:49,925
On a couple of our boards and commissions, we have folks sitting on them,

794
01:25:50,476 --> 01:25:56,081
who are no longer Medford residents, making decisions for Medford residents.

795
01:25:57,002 --> 01:26:10,394
And when I approached the mayor about that, I was told that there is nothing in our city charter that states that to sit on a board or commission, one must be a Medford resident.

796
01:26:10,414 --> 01:26:12,196
And I found that pretty incredulous.

797
01:26:12,216 --> 01:26:14,418
I can see, I suppose,

798
01:26:17,496 --> 01:26:23,499
If you operated a business in the city, you'd have a vested interest, but in some cases, it's just not the case.

799
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:42,370
So something like that, you know, I think could be something that could be looked at seeing the, you know, groups working together, watching the city council consistently asking the mayor for

800
01:26:45,627 --> 01:26:48,889
what they call the warrant articles, which I guess are the bills to be paid.

801
01:26:50,470 --> 01:26:52,331
She's under no obligation to provide them.

802
01:26:52,812 --> 01:26:53,432
Should she be?

803
01:26:53,452 --> 01:26:57,915
I don't know, but that would be something that I think would be worth looking at.

804
01:26:58,435 --> 01:27:08,382
So I think there's a lot of places where I jot down to myself as I'm watching a meeting, well, how come this isn't required?

805
01:27:09,062 --> 01:27:10,223
And should it be required?

806
01:27:10,343 --> 01:27:13,445
I don't know what the answer to that is, but it might at least

807
01:27:14,891 --> 01:27:19,814
in a warrant further discussion as to what could or could not go into a charter.

808
01:27:20,114 --> 01:27:31,700
So that's what I would like to see is, I know I understand the big ones, what representation or not, term limits, length of terms, the different plans and things.

809
01:27:32,140 --> 01:27:37,983
There's so many other things that, it seems like we're not functioning as well as we could.

810
01:27:38,403 --> 01:27:44,566
And I don't know if there are elements of the charter that could help us function better.

811
01:27:45,879 --> 01:27:54,684
I also have the same concerns as some of the others where we have some counselors who are reticent to go forward with this.

812
01:27:56,065 --> 01:27:59,488
And so how do we work with that?

813
01:28:00,929 --> 01:28:07,593
So those would be some of the things that I would be interested in recalling elected officials if the need were to be,

814
01:28:09,222 --> 01:28:09,862
to arise.

815
01:28:09,902 --> 01:28:12,163
I don't think we have a provision for that right now.

816
01:28:12,984 --> 01:28:16,505
Um, our only request is the next election.

817
01:28:16,865 --> 01:28:22,808
And, um, you know, there should be, um, that should be looked at as well.

818
01:28:23,929 --> 01:28:37,895
Um, and my final question, I guess, is, um, somebody commented that we probably couldn't get anything on the ballot for November yet, because backing it out, we would have to be finished with our work pretty quickly.

819
01:28:38,690 --> 01:28:40,871
which is probably not in the realm of possibility.

820
01:28:41,991 --> 01:28:49,252
If we couldn't get something on the November ballot, could we have a special election?

821
01:28:49,512 --> 01:29:05,596
Like let's say if we finish our work later in the summer or early in the fall and then backing things out, would a special election like next winter be a possibility or would we have to wait until the following fall?

822
01:29:08,076 --> 01:29:09,437
Thank you very much for your presentation.

823
01:29:09,457 --> 01:29:10,118
I appreciate it.

824
01:29:14,301 --> 01:29:22,067
Marilyn, do you wanna take a swing at the special election piece and then I can address the following, the other part of about the fall.

825
01:29:24,349 --> 01:29:30,273
You can actually, the text of the special act can provide for a special election.

826
01:29:34,016 --> 01:29:36,218
You would include it in the act

827
01:29:36,905 --> 01:29:42,086
that an election will be held on X date, you know, for the voters to consider this question.

828
01:29:46,088 --> 01:29:48,988
That would be what I've seen done before.

829
01:29:50,949 --> 01:29:57,351
And then the other piece of that, it could be done the following fall, which is 2024.

830
01:29:58,391 --> 01:30:01,052
However, we're still, so we know it can be done.

831
01:30:01,072 --> 01:30:05,653
What we're not sure about, and we're trying actually for another,

832
01:30:06,555 --> 01:30:08,977
for another committee has asked the same question about this.

833
01:30:11,019 --> 01:30:30,133
The only time we've seen it done in the recent past, unfortunately, because it's a state and federal election, there actually were two separate ballots and two separate machines and two separate sets of checkers when a charter was put on the ballot on the same day as the state and federal election, which gets pretty complicated.

834
01:30:30,194 --> 01:30:35,818
So we are trying to get clarification from the secretary of state's office, whether it is possible or not

835
01:30:36,315 --> 01:30:40,138
to have a charter question on the same actual ballot as state and federal.

836
01:30:40,198 --> 01:30:44,922
We don't have an answer to that yet, which has recently been asked again by another committee.

837
01:30:45,442 --> 01:30:47,904
So we will find out an answer hopefully soon on that.

838
01:30:48,365 --> 01:31:02,936
You certainly, so it is possible in 2024 in November, the same day as the presidential and all the other state and federal offices that are up to have a vote on the charter, it might end up being, you actually have to have two physical separate ballots.

839
01:31:02,976 --> 01:31:03,617
We're not sure yet.

840
01:31:07,852 --> 01:31:08,592
Okay, thank you.

841
01:31:09,673 --> 01:31:11,754
Thank you so much for this presentation.

842
01:31:11,774 --> 01:31:15,635
I think we have a lot to look at.

843
01:31:15,655 --> 01:31:17,816
I have a question.

844
01:31:19,297 --> 01:31:28,040
When you talked in your slides, there was the option of a complete rewrite or revisions.

845
01:31:28,240 --> 01:31:34,323
And given that we currently have a planned government, if the committee decides we,

846
01:31:35,550 --> 01:31:44,956
Does that mean we have to decide not to keep the plan and just write a charter that's separate from the plan government?

847
01:31:45,476 --> 01:31:48,178
Would that qualify as writing a new charter?

848
01:31:48,358 --> 01:31:55,582
Or if we just want revisions, does that mean we can keep plan A and make revisions to it?

849
01:31:56,443 --> 01:31:59,385
How would that work, given that we already have a plan government?

850
01:32:00,265 --> 01:32:02,807
So you could- Go ahead, Mary.

851
01:32:03,267 --> 01:32:03,887
Okay, thank you.

852
01:32:06,185 --> 01:32:14,571
We have great concern about trying to go inside plan A and make it responsive.

853
01:32:15,711 --> 01:32:19,054
And it's a pre-home rule law.

854
01:32:21,535 --> 01:32:25,478
Much of state law has moved forward since plan A was written in 1914.

855
01:32:25,858 --> 01:32:30,501
I'm not saying it hasn't been amended along the way.

856
01:32:30,521 --> 01:32:34,044
There are all these references, for example, to elections.

857
01:32:35,034 --> 01:32:47,638
but the state election laws were completely revised and reorganized with the elimination of certain redundancies and clarification of procedures in the late 1970s.

858
01:32:47,918 --> 01:32:55,700
So everything that's in plan A regarding elections is no longer followed.

859
01:32:55,720 --> 01:33:03,903
So there is a, you make a very strong case that you were given an assignment to review the charter

860
01:33:07,961 --> 01:33:24,205
But you can also present recommendations that say, you know, plan A is no longer responsive to our circumstances and just in terms of modernization alone and present, you know, a proposal for a new charter.

861
01:33:27,125 --> 01:33:27,445
Okay.

862
01:33:27,585 --> 01:33:27,965
Thank you.

863
01:33:27,985 --> 01:33:34,587
Do we want to give Frances an opportunity also to chime in here?

864
01:33:38,444 --> 01:33:49,628
Thank you, I'm Frances Wojciech, I'm the Director of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion for the city, and I'm appointed to sit on this as the city's liaison.

865
01:33:53,950 --> 01:33:54,710
Thanks, Frances.

866
01:33:57,571 --> 01:33:58,952
Laurel, do you want to take over?

867
01:34:00,973 --> 01:34:05,394
Unless we have any further questions for the folks from the Collins Center.

868
01:34:06,135 --> 01:34:07,175
Mike, did you have a question?

869
01:34:08,690 --> 01:34:13,975
Yeah, just just really briefly, I'm wondering what our ongoing engagement with the call center looks like?

870
01:34:13,995 --> 01:34:20,400
Is there we are we going to have presentations on specific topics from them on our regular meetings?

871
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:24,143
Or are they going to be advising us answering questions that we have?

872
01:34:24,183 --> 01:34:25,364
Like, what does that look like?

873
01:34:28,887 --> 01:34:28,948
I'm

874
01:34:30,040 --> 01:34:31,662
I'm happy to take that if, if you'd like.

875
01:34:32,243 --> 01:34:41,496
So we do have an agreement for a fixed but but expandable, if needed, number of meetings to participate in.

876
01:34:44,757 --> 01:35:14,044
uh, with those is, you know, we work with the co-chairs and whoever else the coaches designate, if, if there's any other one else involved in agenda setting, um, to, um, come up with, you know, materials based around the topic that you're interested in the topic or topics that you're interested in covering in a particular, uh, meeting, um, to, and depending on whether that's depending what those look like, that could come in the form of, um,

877
01:35:14,964 --> 01:35:17,446
of a memo from us with different pieces.

878
01:35:17,526 --> 01:35:21,370
It could also come in the form of other presentations or documents.

879
01:35:21,390 --> 01:35:28,876
We're really going to kind of, again, follow your lead on what's going to be most helpful.

880
01:35:29,356 --> 01:35:35,461
Following each meeting that we participate in, including this one, we'll follow up with materials that are

881
01:35:37,027 --> 01:35:38,749
responsive to questions that come up.

882
01:35:39,089 --> 01:35:50,682
So for example, if you know questions come up in the meeting that we don't, we can't answer during the meeting, what we'll do is we'll continue to do the research after and then we'll, we'll report back what we find will be available.

883
01:35:51,460 --> 01:36:03,089
Um, uh, to the co-chairs between meetings, uh, to assist in kind of thinking about what the, you know, what they want, what you all want the arc of the work to be, how you want to proceed, how you want to take it.

884
01:36:03,830 --> 01:36:11,376
Um, because as I think I alluded to, there's a, we've seen committees approach the work in very, in many very different ways.

885
01:36:11,456 --> 01:36:17,821
And it really depends on sort of what the committee wants, wants to do, how you want to proceed.

886
01:36:17,841 --> 01:36:19,422
Um, so.

887
01:36:20,143 --> 01:36:35,491
You know, we'll kind of adapt, you know, to the, the, the pathway that we're following to what you all are telling us is going to be, you know, what you want.

888
01:36:36,032 --> 01:36:38,293
We obviously will be happy to advise on that and say,

889
01:36:38,844 --> 01:36:42,125
well, you know, you may not want to take this before this.

890
01:36:42,985 --> 01:36:48,006
You may not want to look at this topic until you've figured out this.

891
01:36:48,146 --> 01:36:53,487
There are best, you know, best practices and sort of an order sequence of how to take this stuff.

892
01:36:53,507 --> 01:37:01,209
So that you don't end up kind of unwind, you know, making a decision, then unwinding it, you know, shortly thereafter, obviously,

893
01:37:01,875 --> 01:37:03,016
it's all interconnected.

894
01:37:03,076 --> 01:37:10,761
So along the way, you may end up making a decision that has to be unwound, but we want to keep that as minimal as possible to kind of keep things moving forward.

895
01:37:12,061 --> 01:37:21,387
We'll want to hear, you know, kind of, we'll want to discuss as our internal team, as well as with the co-chairs and other, and you know, your feedback to them after, you know,

896
01:37:24,056 --> 01:37:44,061
what level of change you're, you're contemplating, uh, what, um, you know, these questions of speed that you have raised and what you want to get done by when, um, this, the question that I think Matthew started with at the beginning, which came up then several other times though, at the course of this, of thinking about,

897
01:37:44,856 --> 01:37:52,118
you know, what the committee wants to do within the parameters of what actually that you all think it can move forward.

898
01:37:53,138 --> 01:38:01,921
Because obviously what you don't want to do is put together something that is, you all think is ideal, but then doesn't, you know, end up, you know, going forward.

899
01:38:03,161 --> 01:38:05,742
So, so weighing that is, is an important piece of this.

900
01:38:07,643 --> 01:38:08,643
So I, you know,

901
01:38:09,443 --> 01:38:10,043
We're here to help.

902
01:38:10,523 --> 01:38:15,585
We'll be as flexible as we can in customizing how we're approaching it with you.

903
01:38:15,686 --> 01:38:21,068
And we're just excited to be here and to support the critical work you're doing.

904
01:38:22,728 --> 01:38:23,409
Thank you.

905
01:38:23,529 --> 01:38:25,870
That's helpful sort of context of the menu of options.

906
01:38:25,890 --> 01:38:26,350
So thank you.

907
01:38:30,051 --> 01:38:31,372
Any other questions?

908
01:38:31,892 --> 01:38:34,793
All right.

909
01:38:35,674 --> 01:38:36,314
Thank you again.

910
01:38:37,054 --> 01:38:38,195
All tremendously helpful.

911
01:38:40,013 --> 01:38:41,415
as we move ahead with this process.

912
01:38:42,135 --> 01:38:47,200
We realize it's going to be a complicated process of a lot of nuances.

913
01:38:47,220 --> 01:38:50,723
So having your expertise is incredibly valuable for all of us.

914
01:38:53,285 --> 01:39:00,472
So the remaining agenda item is just going back over discussion of scheduling of future meetings.

915
01:39:01,032 --> 01:39:03,735
We have already scheduled our next meeting for Wednesday,

916
01:39:04,236 --> 01:39:06,179
February 8th at 6.30 PM.

917
01:39:07,621 --> 01:39:11,846
Based on our conversation at the first meeting, I just wanted to reconfirm.

918
01:39:11,866 --> 01:39:19,116
We had one person who had issues with Thursday, but it appears that their schedule will be opening up as of March.

919
01:39:20,579 --> 01:39:34,563
And so based on the numbers, the notes that I took at the last meeting, is there anybody just among the committee members who would not be available on the first Thursday of the month if we set that as our regular meeting date?

920
01:39:38,364 --> 01:39:38,644
All right.

921
01:39:39,624 --> 01:39:42,745
So that looks like that works for the entire group.

922
01:39:43,085 --> 01:39:48,387
So starting in March, we will aim to have our meetings on the first Thursday of the month.

923
01:39:49,737 --> 01:39:53,059
next meeting following the February meeting would be on March 2nd.

924
01:39:53,639 --> 01:39:55,520
So wonderful.

925
01:39:57,261 --> 01:40:00,323
So that's everything for our agenda.

926
01:40:00,823 --> 01:40:03,004
We do- Sorry, when is the next meeting set for again?

927
01:40:04,225 --> 01:40:08,547
February 8th is the next meeting, Wednesday, February 8th.

928
01:40:12,508 --> 01:40:18,589
And then lastly, we do have a couple of members of the public on the Zoom.

929
01:40:19,409 --> 01:40:28,751
So we wanted to provide the opportunity if there were anybody who wanted to make a comment at this point to go ahead and speak up if you wanna raise your hand on Zoom.

930
01:40:29,471 --> 01:40:32,852
If you could please introduce yourself, your name and your address for the record.

931
01:40:34,072 --> 01:40:36,012
So it looks like it doesn't anybody.

932
01:40:37,053 --> 01:40:39,733
So we've got Bill, you wanna go ahead?

933
01:40:40,379 --> 01:40:45,142
And should we, sorry, should we clarify as well that it's a three minute time limit?

934
01:40:45,522 --> 01:40:46,123
Yes, certainly.

935
01:40:46,503 --> 01:40:46,903
Yes.

936
01:40:47,183 --> 01:40:51,446
We agreed upon at our prior meeting that public comment would be limited to three minutes.

937
01:40:51,546 --> 01:40:52,987
So Bill, if you want to go ahead.

938
01:40:53,887 --> 01:40:55,428
Hi, my name is Bill Giglio.

939
01:40:55,508 --> 01:40:56,349
I live on Winthrop street.

940
01:40:56,709 --> 01:40:58,710
I won't even take more than 30 seconds.

941
01:40:58,750 --> 01:41:04,654
I just wanted to let you guys know as a citizen, you know, as a citizen of Medford, we really appreciate the,

942
01:41:05,681 --> 01:41:11,406
Personally, I really appreciate that you guys are all taking the time to look at this because it's definitely very long overdue.

943
01:41:11,466 --> 01:41:16,409
And I think from some of the people that I know on the committee right there, we're definitely in good hands.

944
01:41:16,469 --> 01:41:17,510
So thank you guys very much.

945
01:41:17,530 --> 01:41:20,953
Thank you for that.

946
01:41:21,073 --> 01:41:21,373
Tony.

947
01:41:22,574 --> 01:41:24,296
I just echo what Bill just said.

948
01:41:24,316 --> 01:41:27,398
I just wanted to thank everybody for volunteering their time.

949
01:41:28,103 --> 01:41:34,447
on behalf of the citizens of Medford and I'm sorry, Tony Puccio, Tanner Street, Medford, I apologize.

950
01:41:34,948 --> 01:41:36,749
But I just wanted to thank everyone for their time.

951
01:41:36,849 --> 01:41:43,033
And many of us residents appreciate the sacrifices you are making to do this important work.

952
01:41:43,073 --> 01:41:43,714
So thank you.

953
01:41:44,074 --> 01:41:49,117
And I also wanted to comment to say thank you for allowing the public to be part of this.

954
01:41:49,478 --> 01:41:52,960
And hopefully you'll continue to engage

955
01:41:53,000 --> 01:42:02,847
to public and I'm sure you will, as Bill alluded to, this looks like a great group and I'm looking forward to see what comes out of this.

956
01:42:02,947 --> 01:42:09,291
And I hope you continue to allow the public to be watching these meetings and hopefully be able to chime in from time to time.

957
01:42:09,771 --> 01:42:10,251
Thanks again.

958
01:42:10,271 --> 01:42:11,192
Good night.

959
01:42:11,212 --> 01:42:12,293
Thank you.

960
01:42:12,613 --> 01:42:13,053
Thank you.

961
01:42:16,175 --> 01:42:18,657
Do we have anybody else who would like to make a comment from the public?

962
01:42:22,795 --> 01:42:31,281
All right, with that, unless we have any other questions from the group, I think we can adjourn and we will see everybody on February 8th.
