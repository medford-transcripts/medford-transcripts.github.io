236
00:15:40,668 --> 00:15:45,932

243
00:15:52,937 --> 00:16:02,202
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that when the request came in for the new ownership, change of ownership, nothing changes.

244
00:16:02,782 --> 00:16:04,983
[SPEAKER_06]: But unfortunately, at the time,

245
00:16:05,577 --> 00:16:15,988
[SPEAKER_06]: that with new management, the prior permit went with the owner, so we requested for you to come in and you've done everything that's needed.

246
00:16:16,488 --> 00:16:22,275
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we had one, as we went through the process, just one thing you should take note of.

247
00:16:22,335 --> 00:16:24,317
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that we have

248
00:16:25,031 --> 00:16:46,052
[SPEAKER_06]: there's we haven't had many complaints at that area we'll ask for another 30 60 day review with the new ownership but at the same time there was one question about some cleanliness around the area especially in the later hours when other businesses come in the next morning there were some things that that were left you just want to make sure that that area is maintained

249
00:16:46,732 --> 00:16:49,373
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's some oversight there.

250
00:16:49,413 --> 00:16:53,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Other than that, with the 30 and 60 day review, I would move approval.

251
00:16:53,935 --> 00:16:54,836
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything is in order.

252
00:16:55,036 --> 00:16:59,478
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, this has been an existing business for many, many years.

253
00:17:00,198 --> 00:17:09,102
[SPEAKER_06]: And the hours of operations, it wouldn't be fair to change those now for what was established for many years in that location with the same business.

254
00:17:09,122 --> 00:17:09,642
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you.

255

339
00:18:39,364 --> 00:18:39,424
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

340
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:40,646

341
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:41,346

[SPEAKER_13]: 23-419.

343
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:54,818
[SPEAKER_13]: To Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council, regarding District Improvement Financing Program Order, dear President Morell and members of the City Council, I respectfully request

344
00:18:56,104 --> 00:19:06,628
[SPEAKER_13]: I respectfully request and recommend your honorable body in accordance with MGL Chapter 40Q to adopt the enclosed order relating to the creation and implementation of a district improvement financing program for Medford Square.

345
00:19:07,148 --> 00:19:14,391
[SPEAKER_13]: Alicia Hunt, Director of Planning, Development Sustainability, and Victoria Storrs, President and Founder of Storrs Associates, will be present at the meeting to answer any questions.

346
00:19:14,691 --> 00:19:19,934
[SPEAKER_13]: Given City Council Rule 30, the draft ordinance was reviewed by KB Law, and they have approved it as to form.

347
00:19:20,094 --> 00:19:21,594
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

348
00:19:21,674 --> 00:19:23,235
[SPEAKER_13]: Sincerely, Brenna Lungo-Koehn, Mayor.

349
00:19:24,806 --> 00:19:48,638
[SPEAKER_13]: Order that the Medford City Council will hereby vote in accordance with the provisions of General Law Chapter 40Q2.1, approve, create, and implement a District Improvement Financing Plan, also known as a DIF, to encourage increased residential, industrial, and commercial activity within a development district to be designated and known as the Medford Square DIF Development District, a district pursuant to General Law's Chapter 40Q, as shown on the City of Medford Square.

350
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,500
[SPEAKER_13]: DIF Master Plan dated October 3rd, 2023,

351
00:19:52,836 --> 00:20:15,706
[SPEAKER_13]: on file in the office of the city clerk and presented to the council, quote, the plan, which is incorporated by reference and in connection therewith approve and adopt a development program for the Medford square development district on file in the office of the city clerk for the improvement of the quality of life and physical facilities and infrastructure of such district and create a development program fund consistent with the requirements of general law chapter 40Q and two,

352
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:34,034
[SPEAKER_13]: Approve the Medford Square Diff Invested Revenue District, the IRD, pursuant to general law chapter 40Q, which is approximately 64.4 acres and coterminous with the development district and is comprised of parcels as shown on the map and as listed in attachment one of the above reference document.

353
00:20:34,154 --> 00:20:41,258
[SPEAKER_13]: And in connection therewith, approve and adopt an invested revenue district development program for the Medford Square Diff Invested Revenue District.

354
00:20:41,418 --> 00:20:46,741
[SPEAKER_13]: And three, set the percentage of the tax increment to be retained to finance the diff according to the plan.

355
00:20:47,510 --> 00:21:05,557
[SPEAKER_13]: and four to make such designations and take any additional steps as may be necessary to authorize such diff or administer said program through the mayor and her designee which is the department of planning development and sustainability after signed authorization and five requests through the mayor that the city of medford assessing department establish and certify

356
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:22,744
[SPEAKER_13]: the original assessed value of the taxable property within the boundaries of the district, and on an annual basis, certify the amount by which the assessed value has increased or decreased from the original value, and six, to authorize the mayor to execute agreements and take such additional action as the mayor deems necessary or appropriate.

357
00:21:23,364 --> 00:21:30,850
[SPEAKER_13]: So we did have a committee of the whole on this two weeks ago, and we do have Director Hunt on the call, as well as Victoria Storrs, and we also have Attorney Everett,

358
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:34,791
[SPEAKER_13]: I think for this one.

359
00:21:34,991 --> 00:21:35,511
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't keep track.

360
00:21:35,871 --> 00:21:40,092
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe for this one in case we have any questions as far as legal questions.

361
00:21:40,652 --> 00:21:49,235
[SPEAKER_13]: So happy to turn it over if folks want a reminder presentation from Victoria Storrs or if folks have questions to start off.

362
00:21:52,116 --> 00:21:53,396
[SPEAKER_13]: I will hand it over to you.

363
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:55,717
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe Victoria is on the call if she was.

364
00:21:55,937 --> 00:21:57,677
[SPEAKER_13]: Recording in progress.

365
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:00,018
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, she's right.

366
00:22:00,138 --> 00:22:00,198
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

367
00:22:04,087 --> 00:22:08,869
[SPEAKER_13]: I will hand it off to you to just kind of give a summary of, again, what is before the council tonight.

368
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,811
[SPEAKER_21]: Good evening, council president and council members.

369
00:22:12,891 --> 00:22:18,273
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for inviting me back for this first reading in front of city council.

370
00:22:23,215 --> 00:22:29,217
[SPEAKER_21]: Two questions that I'd like to answer before opening up the floor for your continued questions and discussion.

371
00:22:29,777 --> 00:22:31,598
[SPEAKER_21]: The first question, what is DIF?

372
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:33,279
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a tool

373
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:44,390
[SPEAKER_21]: to help pay for critical infrastructure and related projects, such as studies and plans that support it, infrastructure projects needed for new development to happen in the city.

374
00:22:45,842 --> 00:22:51,545
[SPEAKER_21]: DIF lets you capture a portion of future tax revenues generated by the new development.

375
00:22:52,485 --> 00:23:07,332
[SPEAKER_21]: And DIF also, as a tool, can make the city more competitive for state and federal grants because its adoption and use demonstrates a local commitment to getting the projects built and welcoming certain kinds of development.

376
00:23:07,952 --> 00:23:09,153
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's the nature of the tool.

377
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:16,194
[SPEAKER_21]: Why is the city council being asked to adopt this tool in a portion of Medford Square?

378
00:23:17,776 --> 00:23:28,624
[SPEAKER_21]: Because the infrastructure needs in Medford Square, particularly the neighborhood around where you're sitting this evening, around City Hall, the infrastructure needs are significant.

379
00:23:28,984 --> 00:23:36,310
[SPEAKER_21]: And without the public investment, the kinds of projects the city wants can't afford to come.

380
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:37,671
[SPEAKER_21]: The sites aren't ready.

381
00:23:38,191 --> 00:23:38,912
[SPEAKER_21]: For example,

382
00:23:39,798 --> 00:23:52,200
[SPEAKER_21]: There is not currently enough water available to the priority site to support the kind of multifamily housing that the city has been discussing for those parcels in various plans for the past couple of years.

383
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:58,801
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's the what is DIF and the why is the city council being asked to adopt it now?

384
00:23:58,821 --> 00:24:02,882
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

385
00:24:03,202 --> 00:24:05,082
[SPEAKER_13]: Questions from the council or discussion?

386
00:24:09,217 --> 00:24:11,538
[SPEAKER_13]: I have one question because I don't have questions.

387
00:24:11,918 --> 00:24:24,723
[SPEAKER_13]: So as this is a simple ordinance, if that is something that future council decides they would no longer like to take part in, it's just reversing the process of which is changing the ordinance or removing the ordinance.

388
00:24:24,743 --> 00:24:30,326
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no other additional hoops to jump through should the council decide they don't, a future council decide they don't want to take part.

389
00:24:31,826 --> 00:24:32,987
[SPEAKER_21]: That is correct.

390
00:24:33,127 --> 00:24:36,088
[SPEAKER_21]: You would undergo the ordinary ordinance process

391
00:24:36,637 --> 00:24:51,407
[SPEAKER_21]: to repeal it, the only caveat is that if you have existing agreements, then those agreements would need to be over or unwound before you repeal to the deaf.

392
00:24:52,928 --> 00:24:53,188
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

393
00:24:53,795 --> 00:24:54,376
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Caraviello.

394
00:24:54,416 --> 00:24:58,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Madam President, and thank you for your presentation last week and this week.

395
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:01,162
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is a question I probably should have asked last week.

396
00:25:01,482 --> 00:25:04,746
[SPEAKER_05]: So I understand the process.

397
00:25:05,246 --> 00:25:07,548
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is for the Medford Square area, correct?

398
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:09,130
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

399
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:12,193
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have needs on Mystic Avenue.

400
00:25:13,593 --> 00:25:16,055
[SPEAKER_05]: We have development needs throughout the whole city.

401
00:25:16,135 --> 00:25:18,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Why are we just doing Method Square?

402
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:23,480
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, are we going to look to diff every time a section of town needs work?

403
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:32,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we going to look to put a diff in, let's say, in Wellington or Riverside Avenue or Mystic Avenue?

404
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:41,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that a possibility, or this is just going to concentrate in Method Square, or are we looking to diff all the commercial areas that we're looking to develop going down the line?

405
00:25:44,592 --> 00:25:48,998
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor, I will answer factually and then Director Hunt will step in.

406
00:25:50,339 --> 00:25:56,126
[SPEAKER_21]: Municipalities can use DIF in various portions of their communities.

407
00:25:57,321 --> 00:26:06,545
[SPEAKER_21]: Each diff use would be driven by the current and expected needs of that district and would always go through this ordinance process.

408
00:26:07,086 --> 00:26:13,168
[SPEAKER_21]: So choosing this one does not mean that you would necessarily use the tool again, nor does it mean that you would not.

409
00:26:13,569 --> 00:26:15,469
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'll let Director Hunt take it from there.

410
00:26:24,488 --> 00:26:30,223
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, good evening Councilors, I apologize for being remote, but you probably prefer that because I'm not feeling very well.

411
00:26:32,422 --> 00:26:51,277
[SPEAKER_01]: So the reason we chose Medford Square first was actually our economic development director, Victor Schrader, identified this as a good tool as part of the project for developing the Medford Square parcels that was put to him as a priority project to move forward in the city.

412
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:55,160
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he identified this as something that would help with that project.

413
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:59,802
[SPEAKER_01]: And applied for the grant to pay for victorious time to help us with this one.

414
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:02,144
[SPEAKER_01]: That is essentially why we started here.

415
00:27:02,824 --> 00:27:06,606
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, because this area, these are parcels that we own.

416
00:27:07,187 --> 00:27:13,030
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we would like to get the best possible community benefits out of this.

417
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,630
[SPEAKER_01]: these projects at this location.

418
00:27:16,131 --> 00:27:19,892
[SPEAKER_01]: Other parcels that the city's interested in redevelopment may look at a diff.

419
00:27:19,912 --> 00:27:23,453
[SPEAKER_01]: They may look at other tools, but the city doesn't own those parcels.

420
00:27:23,533 --> 00:27:25,793
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's also market forces at play there.

421
00:27:25,813 --> 00:27:29,474
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so hopefully that perhaps answers your question.

422
00:27:29,494 --> 00:27:33,135
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just skilled.

423
00:27:34,976 --> 00:27:40,057
[SPEAKER_05]: So why can't we just put this into a throng whole community?

424
00:27:40,433 --> 00:27:46,296
[SPEAKER_05]: because otherwise we're gonna have to go back again and hire consultants again and do it again at more cost to the city.

425
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:50,218
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that a correct statement or am I misaccepting?

426
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:56,961
[SPEAKER_01]: So Victoria, this time is paid for for the city through a grant through mass development to help us with this.

427
00:27:57,581 --> 00:28:07,906
[SPEAKER_01]: Once we've done this once, there's a lot of it that we would need a lot less help to do it again because there was a lot of education and structure that we needed assistance with the first time around.

428
00:28:09,707 --> 00:28:12,409
[SPEAKER_01]: We also, it would go in each individual area.

429
00:28:12,509 --> 00:28:20,694
[SPEAKER_01]: Partially a diff is location specific to put the increased revenue from that area back into that area.

430
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:23,656
[SPEAKER_01]: So you wouldn't just do the whole city at once.

431
00:28:23,696 --> 00:28:25,857
[SPEAKER_01]: You might identify a couple different parcels.

432
00:28:26,377 --> 00:28:34,942
[SPEAKER_01]: But it also helps developers know that you are serious and investing in this specific location right now.

433
00:28:36,284 --> 00:28:40,430
[SPEAKER_01]: The other, sorry, I am really a little slow this evening.

434
00:28:42,333 --> 00:28:48,202
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thought with that is that the DIF does help the state.

435
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:59,003
[SPEAKER_01]: Realize that you're serious about this and they are more likely to award other economic development grants when you have focused on an area like this.

436
00:28:59,443 --> 00:29:12,508
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, we're actually have been talking to mass development about extending this grant to provide consulting support for the RFP for this process for these parcels.

437
00:29:13,223 --> 00:29:30,312
[SPEAKER_01]: And they basically have indicated that that is something that they're willing to do if we can take like as part of this process that this shows that we're really serious and so they would follow that up with additional grant support with additional technical assistance support on this project.

438
00:29:31,172 --> 00:29:35,215
[SPEAKER_01]: So, that's why we also didn't want to take bite off more than we can chew at once.

439
00:29:35,555 --> 00:29:38,877
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just so many projects that we can manage at one time.

440
00:29:39,658 --> 00:29:44,861
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was 1 project that we could handle if we were trying to do this in 3 different locations.

441
00:29:45,261 --> 00:29:47,783
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure that we have the bandwidth to do that right now.

442
00:29:49,574 --> 00:29:49,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

443
00:29:49,994 --> 00:29:53,235
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would think that we want to show that we're serious in all the projects that we're doing.

444
00:29:54,136 --> 00:29:56,717
[SPEAKER_05]: So just an opinion of my portion of my thoughts.

445
00:29:56,737 --> 00:29:56,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

446
00:29:57,957 --> 00:29:58,897
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Carpella.

447
00:29:58,957 --> 00:29:59,818
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President.

448
00:29:59,958 --> 00:30:02,519
[SPEAKER_06]: And thank you for this new initiative.

449
00:30:02,539 --> 00:30:11,322
[SPEAKER_06]: But I revert back to what we've been talking about for four years now and the lack of a true comprehensive plan of what vision

450
00:30:12,537 --> 00:30:15,358
[SPEAKER_06]: what our city's true vision is, and when we talk about development.

451
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:36,769
[SPEAKER_06]: We talk about all this, we see all this movement, like the spot development, whether it's looking at Mystic Ave, whether it's looking at the Apostle at Wellington and the air rights, whether it's looking at Medford Square, which we have, I think we already have hundreds of thousands of plans that are already written that we haven't looked at.

452
00:30:37,309 --> 00:30:41,651
[SPEAKER_06]: I think what we're doing right now is we're allowing

453
00:30:43,479 --> 00:30:54,706
[SPEAKER_06]: the city and really one department to make a decision what's greater for our community without the true input of what the community wants and the visions of what they see.

454
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:59,109
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been screaming this for years.

455
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:06,094
[SPEAKER_06]: It's funny that we're a few months away from an election and all of a sudden we're being talking about Method Square.

456
00:31:07,775 --> 00:31:16,339
[SPEAKER_06]: truly, I can't support this for the fact that we've been asking for a true comprehensive plan of what we want to do as a community, what direction we want to go in.

457
00:31:16,759 --> 00:31:32,986
[SPEAKER_06]: I know we've been talking to Director Hunt and her department about putting in teams to come in and go to neighborhood by neighborhood and giving some direction of what we see and what we think Medford needs.

458
00:31:33,006 --> 00:31:35,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Because right now, we're a mess.

459
00:31:36,713 --> 00:31:44,917
[SPEAKER_06]: We can't even drive into Medford Square without sitting in 45 minutes of traffic to get from one side of the city to the other.

460
00:31:45,878 --> 00:32:02,006
[SPEAKER_06]: So until, I appreciate the input of the knowledge of acquiring what the DIF is, but I think truly until we have a true comprehensive plan of what we envision Medford to be,

461
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:13,227
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think this council should approve any sort of ordinance that approves anything until we understand what one piece will do to the other piece of this community.

462
00:32:14,387 --> 00:32:15,728
[SPEAKER_06]: We still haven't had these talks.

463
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:18,230
[SPEAKER_06]: We haven't had, have we sat down with the mayor?

464
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:24,654
[SPEAKER_06]: Has this committee sat down with the mayor and talked about a comprehensive plan of what direction we want the city of Medford to go in?

465
00:32:25,054 --> 00:32:25,535
[SPEAKER_06]: We haven't.

466
00:32:26,886 --> 00:32:29,007
[SPEAKER_06]: We haven't, we're a few months away from election.

467
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:33,310
[SPEAKER_06]: We wanna talk about redoing Medford Square, cause it looks good on a flyer.

468
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:38,033
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think that we need to slow down and do this the right way.

469
00:32:39,273 --> 00:32:51,360
[SPEAKER_06]: And I say this again, I remember when this disgusting area, when I started working 15 years ago in a neighboring community that people used to laugh at, it was an armpit.

470
00:32:52,341 --> 00:32:53,922
[SPEAKER_06]: And now it's one of the most popular,

471
00:32:55,847 --> 00:32:59,983
[SPEAKER_06]: most exciting spots in Massachusetts to go to.

472
00:33:01,075 --> 00:33:02,156
[SPEAKER_06]: and that's Assembly Road.

473
00:33:02,836 --> 00:33:09,979
[SPEAKER_06]: And now that's turning from Assembly Road down to Lowell Broadway, into Union Square, around the Highland area.

474
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,761
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a plan that they had in that community with the neighborhoods.

475
00:33:14,181 --> 00:33:24,306
[SPEAKER_06]: I would sit in community meetings and we would look at what impact we would have with fire, police, recreation, what happens with traffic studies, everything.

476
00:33:24,346 --> 00:33:26,828
[SPEAKER_06]: We would sit together and we would create a plan.

477
00:33:27,288 --> 00:33:28,949
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's how we grew that community.

478
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:32,541
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why that community is so, so strong today.

479
00:33:33,422 --> 00:33:35,603
[SPEAKER_06]: And why they have so much money they don't know what to do with.

480
00:33:36,464 --> 00:33:37,184
[SPEAKER_06]: And then guess what?

481
00:33:37,204 --> 00:33:40,647
[SPEAKER_06]: A neighbor commuting next to them said, hey, that's a great idea.

482
00:33:41,167 --> 00:33:42,768
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's follow that same idea.

483
00:33:42,788 --> 00:33:49,033
[SPEAKER_06]: They got a little help with the casino, but now you're seeing that grow, that area grow, and it's growing.

484
00:33:50,914 --> 00:33:52,075
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't see that here.

485
00:33:52,095 --> 00:33:54,677
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we don't have a plan.

486
00:33:55,097 --> 00:33:55,998
[SPEAKER_06]: There isn't a plan.

487
00:33:56,258 --> 00:33:57,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Or if there is, it's a secret.

488
00:33:59,243 --> 00:34:10,572
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, I'm not gonna move on to any, I stopped voting on money papers years ago because we still don't have true numbers of what the budget, the budget that was voted for this past year.

489
00:34:11,172 --> 00:34:15,876
[SPEAKER_06]: We were told by the finance director those numbers were not true, but we still voted it.

490
00:34:16,456 --> 00:34:30,326
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to vote on any money papers, and I'm sure not going to vote on any development issues right now until we sit with the mayor and understand what we have for a true comprehensive plan to see what direction Medford is going in.

491
00:34:30,727 --> 00:34:31,807
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we want to be Somerville?

492
00:34:31,887 --> 00:34:33,068
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we want to be Winchester?

493
00:34:33,749 --> 00:34:35,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we want to be something in the middle?

494
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:35,650
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't know.

495
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:44,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Because right now, Councilor Caraviello has said it for years, we're the last piece of dirt.

496
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:48,224
[SPEAKER_06]: that developers can use now, closest to Boston.

497
00:34:48,264 --> 00:34:49,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody else is dried up.

498
00:34:49,765 --> 00:34:50,505
[SPEAKER_06]: They can't touch it.

499
00:34:51,426 --> 00:34:52,546
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is valuable.

500
00:34:53,006 --> 00:34:58,729
[SPEAKER_06]: To jump into anything because we got a grant for it, that's not responsible.

501
00:34:59,849 --> 00:35:01,030
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that's responsible.

502
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:02,270
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we need to see the biggest.

503
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:04,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Caraviello brings up a great point.

504
00:35:05,372 --> 00:35:10,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Where does this ordinance, how does this play a factor in Wellington area?

505
00:35:10,574 --> 00:35:12,615
[SPEAKER_06]: How does it play a factor on Mystic Ave?

506
00:35:12,655 --> 00:35:15,056
[SPEAKER_06]: How does this play a factor in other areas in our community?

507
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:16,947
[SPEAKER_06]: And why wouldn't we use it?

508
00:35:17,207 --> 00:35:19,830
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is a conversation that we're not talking about.

509
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:21,972
[SPEAKER_06]: We're talking about things in little bunches.

510
00:35:22,493 --> 00:35:23,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's do this little bit.

511
00:35:23,614 --> 00:35:24,575
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's do this little bit.

512
00:35:25,676 --> 00:35:27,017
[SPEAKER_06]: And nothing is truly getting done.

513
00:35:27,578 --> 00:35:32,523
[SPEAKER_06]: This is why we don't have a true increase in our new growth.

514
00:35:32,923 --> 00:35:35,546
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't see any of that, like neighboring communities have.

515
00:35:37,172 --> 00:35:47,136
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have a true understanding with whatever growth we have, what it's going to do to our public servants and fire, police, DPW, and our school systems.

516
00:35:48,457 --> 00:35:53,219
[SPEAKER_06]: These are things that should be talked about as you start this process in Medford Square.

517
00:35:53,499 --> 00:35:54,200
[SPEAKER_06]: We haven't done that.

518
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:58,942
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we're putting the cot way ahead of this horse, saying, hey, let's get this done.

519
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:02,552
[SPEAKER_06]: without understanding the true direction that we're going in.

520
00:36:02,832 --> 00:36:08,015
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why I appreciate the presentation, but I couldn't support it.

521
00:36:08,075 --> 00:36:09,016
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President.

522
00:36:09,436 --> 00:36:10,437
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Vice President Bears.

523
00:36:10,917 --> 00:36:11,798
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Madam President.

524
00:36:12,138 --> 00:36:21,284
[SPEAKER_01]: Madam President, I have some information on the city of Somerville and their timeline and our comprehensive plan, if that's at all helpful.

525
00:36:23,186 --> 00:36:26,488
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, we'll go to Vice President Bears and we'll, I appreciate it, we'll come back to you.

526
00:36:27,028 --> 00:36:27,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Bears.

527
00:36:27,789 --> 00:36:28,429
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just be brief.

528
00:36:30,238 --> 00:36:43,472
[SPEAKER_04]: I sat down with Victoria and Alicia prior to our last meeting on this and then, you know, ask some questions during our committee of the whole meeting.

529
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:46,996
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I had some further questions and Victoria was.

530
00:36:49,197 --> 00:36:54,126
[SPEAKER_04]: I was lucky that Victoria was able to answer some of these questions, and I had them included in everybody's packets.

531
00:36:54,166 --> 00:36:59,836
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see here, there's bullet points on just some additional information that I still had as outstanding questions.

532
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:09,191
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the point is well taken that there have been a lot of plans for Medford Square over the past 30 years.

533
00:37:09,231 --> 00:37:24,774
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we all know that the condition of Medford Square is basically a car-prioritized throughway between 93 and 16, makes it dangerous for pedestrians, bicyclists, drivers, and makes it incredibly uninviting for commercial activity.

534
00:37:24,794 --> 00:37:26,974
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not an inviting place to walk to.

535
00:37:27,034 --> 00:37:28,434
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not an inviting place to walk around.

536
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:31,335
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you don't have that, you're not going to have the kind of

537
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:36,503
[SPEAKER_04]: development and the kind of environment that we want to see development.

538
00:37:36,943 --> 00:37:49,292
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we can all agree that we've had many happy days when Clippership Drive or Riverside Ave is closed down and we can all walk around and have Oktoberfest or another event.

539
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:57,538
[SPEAKER_04]: In any case, to me, this doesn't create any new revenue.

540
00:37:57,598 --> 00:37:59,059
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't create anything new.

541
00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:00,941
[SPEAKER_04]: It is, to me, essentially saying,

542
00:38:02,533 --> 00:38:07,677
[SPEAKER_04]: If we want new growth in Medford Square, we need to improve the infrastructure in Medford Square.

543
00:38:08,717 --> 00:38:22,767
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the main ways that we're going to do that is by working on the city-owned parking lots, which we've been looking to develop in a multitude of ways for a long time across multiple mayors and across multiple Medford Square plans.

544
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:29,892
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is actually a way that we are going to prioritize setting aside the funding to actually make those investments.

545
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:31,073
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that that's important

546
00:38:31,648 --> 00:38:34,089
[SPEAKER_04]: investments in the water sewer infrastructure in the right away.

547
00:38:34,109 --> 00:38:50,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, with all due respect on the on the planning side of things, you know, Councilor Caraviello and I and dozens and hundreds and I think a certain thousands of men for residents were involved in the comprehensive planning process, um, to create the city comprehensive plan.

548
00:38:50,492 --> 00:38:55,773
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the major elements of the city comprehensive plan, which was finalized last year.

549
00:38:56,633 --> 00:38:58,615
[SPEAKER_04]: is this kind of development in Medford Square.

550
00:38:58,735 --> 00:39:08,062
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, having the questions answered about A, you know, if we find that the DIF is a tool that isn't working, we can dissolve it.

551
00:39:08,122 --> 00:39:14,546
[SPEAKER_04]: If we find that funds that are put into the DIF, we need to prioritize for general funding so that the council can make those votes.

552
00:39:15,267 --> 00:39:17,929
[SPEAKER_04]: It really, to me, is why not try?

553
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:21,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not implement a tool that might actually get us where

554
00:39:23,252 --> 00:39:29,010
[SPEAKER_04]: many councils and many mayors have failed for many years in terms of actually investing in Medford Square.

555
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:30,735
[SPEAKER_04]: So if it doesn't work.

556
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:44,472
[SPEAKER_04]: it's been made very clear to me that we can dissolve the diff and we can, if we need, if we're looking at funds being tied up in our very tight and difficult budget seasons, we can move those funds back from the diff to the general fund.

557
00:39:45,192 --> 00:39:56,443
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it's good to have a tool in law that actually focuses on making, focuses the city on making Medford Square a vibrant,

558
00:39:57,472 --> 00:40:00,354
[SPEAKER_04]: community hub that it has been in the past.

559
00:40:00,434 --> 00:40:03,916
[SPEAKER_04]: It certainly was before the construction of the highway and hopefully we can make it again.

560
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:04,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

561
00:40:04,636 --> 00:40:05,537
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

562
00:40:05,997 --> 00:40:06,598
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Collins.

563
00:40:08,836 --> 00:40:13,298
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, President Morell, and thank you, Director Hunt and Ms.

564
00:40:13,318 --> 00:40:17,039
[SPEAKER_20]: Storrs for being here again and for all of the context leading up to this vote.

565
00:40:17,319 --> 00:40:22,441
[SPEAKER_20]: I appreciate the discussion around this, this week, last week as well.

566
00:40:22,841 --> 00:40:31,244
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, as we discussed in our Committee of the Whole on this topic last week, you know, coming into this topic, my big concern was essentially, you know,

567
00:40:33,308 --> 00:40:39,469
[SPEAKER_20]: What we don't want, I think what we know that nobody wants is to privilege any one part of the city over another.

568
00:40:39,949 --> 00:40:40,989
[SPEAKER_20]: That's not what we're here to do.

569
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:42,510
[SPEAKER_20]: Nobody wants that.

570
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:48,091
[SPEAKER_20]: Even the folks who, you know, talking about Medford Square and how it's in desperate need of revitalization is the first thing out of their mouths.

571
00:40:49,031 --> 00:40:59,893
[SPEAKER_20]: I think everybody's very aware that all across the city, we're in dire need of reversing chronic underfunding of infrastructure and resident quality of life and roads and sidewalks and infrastructure.

572
00:40:59,913 --> 00:41:00,593
[SPEAKER_20]: We can go on and on.

573
00:41:01,453 --> 00:41:08,977
[SPEAKER_20]: So, getting confirmation on, you know, what the diff is and is not was the first thing that I wanted to talk about in our committee of the whole last week.

574
00:41:09,598 --> 00:41:21,704
[SPEAKER_20]: And, you know, what has led me to, you know, want to enthusiastically approve this plan and then get to, you know, see it run out over the course of several years and, you know, kind of get the experiential evidence of how it's working.

575
00:41:24,628 --> 00:41:32,185
[SPEAKER_20]: It's clear to me, or at least it's clear that everything that we know about this tool tells us that we know that this is not going to take anything away from the general fund.

576
00:41:32,706 --> 00:41:34,851
[SPEAKER_20]: We have a reason to believe that

577
00:41:36,304 --> 00:41:45,773
[SPEAKER_20]: the infrastructure improvements this will allow us to make on the city-owned parcels in Medford Square may very well increase the size of the pie for the general fund.

578
00:41:46,153 --> 00:41:50,797
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's important to me because I care a lot about revitalization of Medford Square.

579
00:41:50,817 --> 00:41:59,785
[SPEAKER_20]: I would love for it if it was easier to bike down here and just enjoy the riverfront and not have it be a place that I have to figure out how to get to safely or meet friends at.

580
00:42:00,305 --> 00:42:01,707
[SPEAKER_20]: I think a lot of people feel the same way.

581
00:42:03,348 --> 00:42:11,215
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that that's a thing that a lot of people share, you know, we see that and the comprehensive plan that was passed last year and I hear that whenever I just amount in the community talking to people.

582
00:42:12,076 --> 00:42:17,321
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think that that's I think that that's very much a community value and then the other part of it.

583
00:42:19,951 --> 00:42:26,997
[SPEAKER_20]: is the possibility for this really to be that flywheel effect that will become a feeder source for the rest of the general fund.

584
00:42:27,418 --> 00:42:42,290
[SPEAKER_20]: If we can see this as a unique opportunity to have this grant and develop this uniquely city-owned parcels right in the back of this building that are empty parking lots right now and have been for a long time, that's what's important to me.

585
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:44,472
[SPEAKER_20]: If that then turns into increased capacity for

586
00:42:45,233 --> 00:42:46,294
[SPEAKER_20]: you know, I think that's a win win.

587
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:48,115
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, starting to refund the rest of the city.

588
00:42:48,535 --> 00:42:49,656
[SPEAKER_20]: Um you know where there's.

589
00:42:50,497 --> 00:42:53,719
[SPEAKER_20]: Where we see the evidence of chronic underfunding day in and day out.

590
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:54,620
[SPEAKER_20]: Um.

591
00:42:56,461 --> 00:42:57,482
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that can be a win win.

592
00:42:57,822 --> 00:43:07,269
[SPEAKER_20]: And you know, hearing that analysis, um, from Director Hunt and the consultants on this, um, you know, I think I'll echo what Vice President Bear says.

593
00:43:07,329 --> 00:43:07,849
[SPEAKER_20]: It's let me just

594
00:43:13,282 --> 00:43:16,743
[SPEAKER_20]: And it seems that at the very least, it's not going to be taking capacity away from the rest of the city.

595
00:43:16,803 --> 00:43:17,884
[SPEAKER_20]: It may well increase it over time.

596
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:20,845
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

597
00:43:21,185 --> 00:43:22,465
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, President Morell.

598
00:43:23,466 --> 00:43:31,048
[SPEAKER_19]: I hear my fellow councilors points, and I think honestly, I agree with most everything that's been said tonight.

599
00:43:32,148 --> 00:43:36,470
[SPEAKER_19]: I totally agree that we need development in other parts of the city as well.

600
00:43:36,985 --> 00:43:43,687
[SPEAKER_19]: I agree that we can't be privileging one part of the city above another, and that we need comprehensive plans to tie the whole city together.

601
00:43:43,707 --> 00:43:57,630
[SPEAKER_19]: I also want to acknowledge that we do have a comprehensive plan in the city that many, many, and by many, I mean hundreds, if not thousands of people gave feedback on.

602
00:43:58,890 --> 00:44:03,712
[SPEAKER_19]: We've had time to review those plans, to give feedback as councillors, as members of the public.

603
00:44:05,878 --> 00:44:18,103
[SPEAKER_19]: I also have had time to read those plans, to read the different press releases that I've come from the mayor's office and from the planning office about these plots, these lots and what we're gonna do with them.

604
00:44:18,563 --> 00:44:27,966
[SPEAKER_19]: And I've had that time to talk to Director Hunt, to talk to Victoria Storrs about what the city is envisioning for these plots.

605
00:44:28,146 --> 00:44:31,048
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think Councilor Bears more or less has said it, but,

606
00:44:33,307 --> 00:44:48,576
[SPEAKER_19]: what we're hearing from the business community, from folks who would want to come to Medford, what we're hearing from people who work in housing and from people who work in planning and development is that Medford Square needs a jolt.

607
00:44:48,897 --> 00:44:52,419
[SPEAKER_19]: And we need more housing to grow our consumer base.

608
00:44:52,839 --> 00:44:54,360
[SPEAKER_19]: We need better traffic patterns.

609
00:44:54,789 --> 00:45:03,276
[SPEAKER_19]: We need better infrastructure, and especially when it comes to water and sewer, which the DIF allows for that investment.

610
00:45:04,457 --> 00:45:16,928
[SPEAKER_19]: And we can't just assume that private developers will come to Medford Square and be willing to invest that much in changing Medford for their own ends.

611
00:45:17,869 --> 00:45:19,270
[SPEAKER_19]: That's not something we've seen anywhere else.

612
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:21,812
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just not cost effective for them.

613
00:45:24,135 --> 00:45:42,494
[SPEAKER_19]: When it comes to the, you know, the idea that we might be privileging one part of the city I think I took this very to heart, especially since, you know, so much of my first campaign running for this was for city council is about making sure that you know we build a city that's working for everyone across our neighborhoods.

614
00:45:44,055 --> 00:45:54,878
[SPEAKER_19]: And when I think about it, I think one important thing to realize is the potential for us to increase the pie, increase the coffers when it comes to our city revenue.

615
00:45:55,458 --> 00:46:10,282
[SPEAKER_19]: And as Councilor Collins has referred to, I don't think it's lost on anyone that certain neighborhoods have especially strong high needs for better streets, for more social services, for more trees.

616
00:46:10,962 --> 00:46:13,004
[SPEAKER_19]: The big question is where that money is going to come from.

617
00:46:13,164 --> 00:46:26,376
[SPEAKER_19]: And this tool gives us the potential to grow that pie, to grow revenue, to create that new growth that we all keep talking about, to invest in those services and to invest in that infrastructure.

618
00:46:28,958 --> 00:46:34,623
[SPEAKER_19]: It's also, I think, a reinvestment in a central neighborhood in the city that

619
00:46:35,505 --> 00:46:37,367
[SPEAKER_19]: really binds all of Medford together.

620
00:46:37,387 --> 00:46:46,376
[SPEAKER_19]: To get from any part of Medford to another, this is one of the neighborhoods that you're more likely to pass by.

621
00:46:47,177 --> 00:46:53,504
[SPEAKER_19]: If I'm going from South Medford to North Medford, if I'm going from Wellington to West Medford, this is the heart of our city.

622
00:46:56,807 --> 00:47:10,512
[SPEAKER_19]: to reinvest, to revitalize this neighborhood, I think is a strategic choice to revitalize something that I think we can all benefit from no matter what neighborhood we live in.

623
00:47:10,732 --> 00:47:18,135
[SPEAKER_19]: I think another plus I see to the DIF is this idea of democratizing development and to give

624
00:47:18,975 --> 00:47:19,275
[SPEAKER_19]: the budget.

625
00:47:19,535 --> 00:47:27,437
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, I think it's going to give us as a city council more say, um and more scrutiny when it comes to how the city and the mayor spending the budget.

626
00:47:28,277 --> 00:47:37,039
[SPEAKER_19]: Um you know any I think an important fact to state is that any spending from the deaths, um, from the funds has to be appropriated each year by the city

627
00:47:44,659 --> 00:47:57,966
[SPEAKER_19]: We don't necessarily have that level of scrutiny, but by adopting the DIFs, that would give us that ability to have that level of transparency, to have that level of democracy, to have those discussions about how we're spending our money.

628
00:47:59,387 --> 00:48:01,868
[SPEAKER_19]: Each year, we can also have a recommendation.

629
00:48:04,049 --> 00:48:15,737
[SPEAKER_19]: to sweep the unused funds from the debt funds, the unspent funds, back into the general fund, which I think should allay some of our fears as well.

630
00:48:16,657 --> 00:48:18,358
[SPEAKER_19]: At the end of the day, I think it's important to

631
00:48:19,415 --> 00:48:24,416
[SPEAKER_19]: to reiterate Councilor Baer's point that this is an experiment.

632
00:48:25,837 --> 00:48:37,379
[SPEAKER_19]: This is us trying to provide that impetus, that stimulus to revitalize Medford Square, the thing that we haven't seen so far in Medford Square.

633
00:48:38,519 --> 00:48:42,640
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think we can disagree as to where that impetus is gonna come from.

634
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:43,881
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that's totally fair.

635
00:48:44,841 --> 00:48:47,101
[SPEAKER_19]: This is a tool that I'm willing to try.

636
00:48:47,802 --> 00:48:49,302
[SPEAKER_19]: And if it doesn't work,

637
00:48:49,642 --> 00:48:54,805
[SPEAKER_19]: I think we can all be mature enough to admit our faults and to admit that it's not working.

638
00:48:54,825 --> 00:48:56,465
[SPEAKER_19]: And as Ms.

639
00:48:56,485 --> 00:49:01,368
[SPEAKER_19]: Storrs said, it's easy to reverse this decision.

640
00:49:01,468 --> 00:49:08,191
[SPEAKER_19]: But I also have optimism that this tool is something that can help our city grow.

641
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:10,632
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Professor Segg.

642
00:49:11,697 --> 00:49:12,537
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Caraviello.

643
00:49:12,577 --> 00:49:13,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Madam President.

644
00:49:13,298 --> 00:49:23,503
[SPEAKER_05]: So you know, in all due respect to my other Councilors, if you look at the chat that that was presented to us, our return on investment is minimal over the next 10 years.

645
00:49:24,043 --> 00:49:29,326
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think I think we're looking to realize I think on the on the first project, maybe eight or $9,000.

646
00:49:29,786 --> 00:49:36,470
[SPEAKER_05]: And the city of decides that's money goes nowhere on an infrastructure project.

647
00:49:37,330 --> 00:49:40,632
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the part that I would think, you know, that

648
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:45,202
[SPEAKER_05]: We're using the same plan that we use over and over and over again.

649
00:49:45,242 --> 00:49:48,685
[SPEAKER_05]: There's 100 plans in the city's office there, and they're all pretty much the same.

650
00:49:49,466 --> 00:49:52,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Not one of them ever talks about the water.

651
00:49:52,528 --> 00:49:55,631
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a city with a waterfront, and we ignore it.

652
00:49:56,111 --> 00:50:00,695
[SPEAKER_05]: We let cars go through it and pass through our business community, okay?

653
00:50:01,516 --> 00:50:03,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Other cities die for waterfronts and waterfront property.

654
00:50:05,299 --> 00:50:11,504
[SPEAKER_05]: That is not even talked about in any of the plans for the city of Medford, of Medford Square.

655
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:20,894
[SPEAKER_05]: And to get a minimal return on the investment, I mean, just look at the chat that was provided to us.

656
00:50:21,214 --> 00:50:23,014
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a lot of money that we're going to be getting back.

657
00:50:23,555 --> 00:50:28,897
[SPEAKER_05]: We could probably get more money in linkage fees from developers than we're going to get on the diff.

658
00:50:28,917 --> 00:50:33,419
[SPEAKER_05]: So I mean, again, I understand the tool.

659
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:43,514
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a giant moneymaker, and for the amount of money it's going to bring in over the next 10 years, it isn't going to get much infrastructure done.

660
00:50:45,015 --> 00:50:46,396
[SPEAKER_05]: That's part of the problem with this.

661
00:50:46,456 --> 00:50:49,898
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's nothing opposed to it, but there's no return on investment on it.

662
00:50:51,078 --> 00:50:54,160
[SPEAKER_05]: And you have other parts of the city that need infrastructure projects, too.

663
00:50:54,501 --> 00:50:57,302
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole city needs infrastructure, not just Medford Square.

664
00:50:59,691 --> 00:51:03,892
[SPEAKER_05]: We have no real plan, and Councilor Behr said it, and I've said it right along.

665
00:51:04,513 --> 00:51:08,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Bedford Square is not inviting to anybody.

666
00:51:11,455 --> 00:51:13,996
[SPEAKER_05]: This summer, I was in Noro Center with my wife.

667
00:51:14,016 --> 00:51:14,736
[SPEAKER_05]: We went out to dinner.

668
00:51:15,556 --> 00:51:20,418
[SPEAKER_05]: I stopped in the middle of the street, and I said to my wife, I said, I want you to stop and tell me what you see here.

669
00:51:20,458 --> 00:51:21,198
[SPEAKER_05]: She didn't understand.

670
00:51:21,218 --> 00:51:23,279
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, stop and tell me what you see.

671
00:51:23,659 --> 00:51:29,301
[SPEAKER_05]: I says, we're looking at tree-lined streets, which look inviting,

672
00:51:30,663 --> 00:51:32,604
[SPEAKER_05]: lit up all over the area.

673
00:51:33,084 --> 00:51:34,825
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an inviting looking city.

674
00:51:35,666 --> 00:51:36,726
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at our square.

675
00:51:37,067 --> 00:51:37,747
[SPEAKER_05]: It's bare.

676
00:51:38,087 --> 00:51:38,768
[SPEAKER_05]: It's barren.

677
00:51:39,028 --> 00:51:40,108
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got a waterfront.

678
00:51:40,508 --> 00:51:44,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Start using the assets we have instead of chasing around.

679
00:51:45,631 --> 00:51:46,352
[SPEAKER_05]: This is where it is.

680
00:51:46,412 --> 00:51:49,754
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm gonna motion to table this until we have a plan.

681
00:51:51,635 --> 00:51:56,637
[SPEAKER_13]: So we have a motion to table, seconded by

682
00:51:58,082 --> 00:51:58,783
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Scarpelli.

683
00:51:59,463 --> 00:52:00,884
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to table is undebatable.

684
00:52:02,005 --> 00:52:03,706
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Clerk, would you please call the roll?

685
00:52:04,807 --> 00:52:05,928
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is a motion to table.

686
00:52:18,598 --> 00:52:21,280
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Caraviello?

687
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:21,600
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

688
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:24,643
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Kellos?

689
00:52:24,843 --> 00:52:24,903
[SPEAKER_20]: No.

690
00:52:26,361 --> 00:52:27,021
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fantastic.

691
00:52:27,622 --> 00:52:28,342
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scarpelli?

692
00:52:29,703 --> 00:52:29,943
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

693
00:52:30,964 --> 00:52:31,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Tseng?

694
00:52:31,605 --> 00:52:31,765
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

695
00:52:32,685 --> 00:52:33,266
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Morocco?

696
00:52:33,686 --> 00:52:33,846
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

697
00:52:34,807 --> 00:52:36,888
[SPEAKER_13]: Two in the affirmative, four in the negative, the motion fails.

698
00:52:38,229 --> 00:52:39,250
[SPEAKER_13]: Discussion from councilors.

699
00:52:40,511 --> 00:52:41,111
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice Mayor Bears.

700
00:52:42,652 --> 00:52:45,034
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand and respect the frustration.

701
00:52:45,054 --> 00:52:49,857
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is a step in the direction that we're talking about here.

702
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:53,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Part of the master plan document for the DIF talks about

703
00:52:54,413 --> 00:52:59,017
[SPEAKER_04]: land consolidation, new roads, new rights of way, you know, we could be talking that.

704
00:52:59,697 --> 00:53:04,141
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you look at the project, I said, you know, this is an outline of looking at money over 30 years.

705
00:53:04,201 --> 00:53:13,629
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree that short term money that's in the chart is not much, but the medium term, the 10 year money, the 30 year money, talking about 10 million, maybe as high as 50 million, right?

706
00:53:13,749 --> 00:53:19,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's a serious money, especially if you're talking about using it over a period to pay for bond costs.

707
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:25,295
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we talk about new rights of way, we could be, we could move clippership drive, right?

708
00:53:25,355 --> 00:53:26,316
[SPEAKER_04]: We can move clippership drive.

709
00:53:26,336 --> 00:53:26,816
[SPEAKER_04]: You can move.

710
00:53:27,156 --> 00:53:27,597
[SPEAKER_04]: You can move.

711
00:53:27,637 --> 00:53:28,678
[SPEAKER_04]: George has to drive.

712
00:53:29,299 --> 00:53:31,841
[SPEAKER_04]: You could adjust city hall mall.

713
00:53:31,881 --> 00:53:35,665
[SPEAKER_04]: You could build a new right of way here and increase access to the waterfront.

714
00:53:35,705 --> 00:53:36,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly what you're saying.

715
00:53:38,093 --> 00:53:39,733
[SPEAKER_04]: This doesn't do that in a week.

716
00:53:40,034 --> 00:53:40,734
[SPEAKER_04]: I completely agree.

717
00:53:40,754 --> 00:53:42,154
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't do it in a year or two years.

718
00:53:42,774 --> 00:53:44,915
[SPEAKER_04]: And it doesn't do it along the timeline that I would prefer.

719
00:53:45,315 --> 00:53:45,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

720
00:53:45,635 --> 00:53:50,296
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to have something in place sooner than 10 years or 30 years.

721
00:53:50,396 --> 00:53:50,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

722
00:53:51,376 --> 00:53:53,617
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is a starting point.

723
00:53:53,657 --> 00:53:54,997
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's really all I'm saying here.

724
00:53:55,037 --> 00:53:56,878
[SPEAKER_04]: If it doesn't work and if we don't see it.

725
00:53:57,945 --> 00:53:59,385
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the authority to repeal it.

726
00:53:59,425 --> 00:54:01,006
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the authority to sweep the funds back.

727
00:54:01,026 --> 00:54:02,706
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the authority to take a different approach.

728
00:54:02,966 --> 00:54:07,728
[SPEAKER_04]: So I see this as giving the Council more power over the exact questions that we're all concerned about here.

729
00:54:09,048 --> 00:54:09,288
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

730
00:54:09,308 --> 00:54:10,589
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Scarpelli, then Councilor Collins.

731
00:54:11,029 --> 00:54:12,229
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President.

732
00:54:12,449 --> 00:54:18,411
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, this is a lively debate that I think it's interesting and it's informative.

733
00:54:18,491 --> 00:54:21,412
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, it brings us back to the original question.

734
00:54:22,430 --> 00:54:29,234
[SPEAKER_06]: this would be a great opportunity to use a great tool in our toolbox if we knew what the plan is.

735
00:54:30,775 --> 00:54:49,967
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the idea that we want to work on Medford Square right now and use this tool, but understand something, without a true plan about moving one street and moving another street, how that affects the plan just right down the road on Mystic Ave or just down the road on Riverside Ave.

736
00:54:51,975 --> 00:54:56,356
[SPEAKER_06]: or just down the road in West Medford Square, or just down the road in Salem Street.

737
00:54:58,157 --> 00:55:01,498
[SPEAKER_06]: So there are so many, if you look at what we're talking about here, it's a great idea.

738
00:55:02,358 --> 00:55:03,919
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a great tool in the toolbox.

739
00:55:04,399 --> 00:55:07,340
[SPEAKER_06]: The only problem is we don't have a toolbox yet.

740
00:55:08,927 --> 00:55:12,508
[SPEAKER_06]: No one has anyone talked to anybody here because I haven't talked to anybody.

741
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:17,030
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't sat with the team and said, this is our vision.

742
00:55:17,611 --> 00:55:29,615
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a true comprehensive plan that the community is involved to sit down and deliberate and share their thoughts and where method's gonna go.

743
00:55:31,436 --> 00:55:36,038
[SPEAKER_06]: The mayor is putting thousands of committees and boards together.

744
00:55:38,469 --> 00:55:41,991
[SPEAKER_06]: and these little bits and pieces like getting bit in the ankle over and over again.

745
00:55:42,412 --> 00:55:44,873
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds great, okay?

746
00:55:44,993 --> 00:55:48,196
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a start, but start for what?

747
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:50,737
[SPEAKER_06]: What is it a start of?

748
00:55:51,518 --> 00:55:55,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Because when you start something, there's a vision, there's a finale.

749
00:55:55,801 --> 00:56:02,525
[SPEAKER_06]: When you have a starting point, your destination, your journey takes you somewhere.

750
00:56:03,666 --> 00:56:06,388
[SPEAKER_06]: With this starting point, we don't know where it's going, everyone.

751
00:56:07,339 --> 00:56:08,260
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I'm saying.

752
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:09,761
[SPEAKER_06]: I all agree, we all agree.

753
00:56:10,441 --> 00:56:16,165
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a good tool if you had the opportunity to understand what we're looking at in totality.

754
00:56:17,366 --> 00:56:18,426
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have that.

755
00:56:20,047 --> 00:56:23,069
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it's just narrow minded that we're not thinking of the big picture.

756
00:56:24,670 --> 00:56:28,533
[SPEAKER_06]: We're moving and changing things for the sake that you don't know.

757
00:56:29,173 --> 00:56:32,976
[SPEAKER_06]: We keep talking about underserved communities and underserved parts of our community.

758
00:56:33,396 --> 00:56:34,517
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't know the impact.

759
00:56:35,807 --> 00:56:40,049
[SPEAKER_06]: By changing this ordinance, you don't know the impact that's gonna have.

760
00:56:41,889 --> 00:56:43,990
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't know the impact that it's gonna have.

761
00:56:44,730 --> 00:56:49,332
[SPEAKER_06]: And has this plan talked about what happens with our infrastructure?

762
00:56:49,552 --> 00:56:51,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Have we talked about what's surrounded it?

763
00:56:51,773 --> 00:56:54,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Have we talked about the fire, police, teachers, the school department?

764
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:57,856
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a text this morning.

765
00:56:58,336 --> 00:57:02,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Schools are adding more kindergarten classes.

766
00:57:02,797 --> 00:57:03,898
[SPEAKER_06]: Classes are getting filled.

767
00:57:05,203 --> 00:57:07,924
[SPEAKER_06]: and just keep adding it with no direction.

768
00:57:09,964 --> 00:57:11,684
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, this is a good idea.

769
00:57:11,724 --> 00:57:12,864
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree with my colleagues.

770
00:57:13,325 --> 00:57:14,325
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's a good idea.

771
00:57:15,165 --> 00:57:17,565
[SPEAKER_06]: If you had a plan that we can say, this is great.

772
00:57:19,086 --> 00:57:20,586
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the plan in Medford Square.

773
00:57:20,606 --> 00:57:31,088
[SPEAKER_06]: This is how it's gonna roll into probably one of the biggest opportunities we have, and that's Mystic Ave, especially along the highway side.

774
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:34,086
[SPEAKER_06]: You have so many opportunities, but we don't know.

775
00:57:34,828 --> 00:57:36,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, it's just people talking.

776
00:57:37,938 --> 00:57:43,299
[SPEAKER_06]: It's people talking and no one's, but there's no one leading us and saying, this is what we should do.

777
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:44,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's, we talked about it.

778
00:57:45,019 --> 00:57:52,701
[SPEAKER_06]: This council has talked with the development director and we've talked about putting in, you know, getting a zoning consultant in place.

779
00:57:52,741 --> 00:58:01,142
[SPEAKER_06]: We've talked about getting a team in so we could sit down to see what zoning we want from Medford, what growth we want from Medford, what direction we want from Medford.

780
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:03,683
[SPEAKER_06]: But if we keep changing these little pieces,

781
00:58:06,801 --> 00:58:10,984
[SPEAKER_06]: I use the parcel land we voted for in Wellington.

782
00:58:11,224 --> 00:58:12,985
[SPEAKER_06]: We still have the air rights.

783
00:58:13,025 --> 00:58:19,128
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody keeps talking about the air rights with the T. Well, I found out the other day that the T wants that land.

784
00:58:20,769 --> 00:58:22,850
[SPEAKER_06]: The T's, and who's gonna get it first?

785
00:58:22,870 --> 00:58:23,931
[SPEAKER_06]: The T of the city of Medford.

786
00:58:24,271 --> 00:58:25,632
[SPEAKER_06]: Who do you think's gonna get that first?

787
00:58:27,756 --> 00:58:40,746
[SPEAKER_06]: These are the things I'm saying until we have focus on this in the back door, the T is coming in to negotiate what they want at Wellington station, where that could be a huge gateway to our community, what we want to do.

788
00:58:40,786 --> 00:58:44,189
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, I appreciate everyone's input.

789
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:47,331
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a, it's a, it's, it's, it's a respectful debate.

790
00:58:47,412 --> 00:58:49,833
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's, it's bring some make some great points.

791
00:58:49,954 --> 00:58:51,435
[SPEAKER_06]: All I'm saying is I agree with you.

792
00:58:51,835 --> 00:58:56,679
[SPEAKER_06]: That is a good tool, but I don't agree that we don't have a plan

793
00:58:57,442 --> 00:58:58,323
[SPEAKER_06]: to use this tool.

794
00:58:59,906 --> 00:59:03,171
[SPEAKER_06]: One part of the community that's small minded, that's narrow thinking.

795
00:59:03,231 --> 00:59:06,136
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to understand what we're looking at the city.

796
00:59:06,196 --> 00:59:06,677
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you.

797
00:59:09,522 --> 00:59:12,064
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, President Morell, and I want to echo Councilor Scarpelli.

798
00:59:12,084 --> 00:59:13,684
[SPEAKER_20]: I really do appreciate the debate about this.

799
00:59:13,744 --> 00:59:26,292
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that between last week and this week, I think that, you know, especially for residents of this community, it's important that we look at this from different perspectives and that we share that openly.

800
00:59:27,693 --> 00:59:31,995
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think that I've made my stance and my opinion on it pretty clear, so I don't want to go on at length.

801
00:59:35,157 --> 00:59:36,058
[SPEAKER_20]: or beat a tired horse.

802
00:59:36,118 --> 00:59:53,040
[SPEAKER_20]: But the other point that I do want to make that I forgot to make before was one thing that I found really compelling from our committee of the whole last week is that defunds should the city council decide to appropriate them and approve an appropriation to this effect would in fact, one thing it could be used for is improving our capacity for

803
00:59:54,125 --> 01:00:00,309
[SPEAKER_20]: Developing plans for Medford square for implementing plans from the comprehensive plan from the deaf master plan.

804
01:00:00,329 --> 01:00:07,954
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, I mean, to me, that's just 1 part of looking at this as a tool that increases capacity that doesn't subtract capacity from anything else.

805
01:00:08,535 --> 01:00:10,956
[SPEAKER_20]: It increases our capacity for getting grants.

806
01:00:11,016 --> 01:00:12,718
[SPEAKER_20]: It increases our capacity for.

807
01:00:14,024 --> 01:00:24,894
[SPEAKER_20]: taking our existing plans, comprehensive plan, et cetera, and making them more concrete and actionable as we're attracting development and investment in our infrastructure.

808
01:00:27,396 --> 01:00:30,199
[SPEAKER_20]: But with that, I think I've said a lot about my stance on this.

809
01:00:30,279 --> 01:00:34,563
[SPEAKER_20]: I would motion to approve for first reading after further discussion with my fellow councilors.

810
01:00:35,224 --> 01:00:36,825
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, I was gonna move for approval of first reading.

811
01:00:36,845 --> 01:00:38,026
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

812
01:00:38,046 --> 01:00:38,647
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Caraviello.

813
01:00:39,111 --> 01:00:39,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Madam President.

814
01:00:39,912 --> 01:00:44,216
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, just on the last thing here, you know, we keep talking about development.

815
01:00:45,477 --> 01:00:46,618
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have a development director.

816
01:00:46,878 --> 01:00:48,059
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a part-time person.

817
01:00:48,459 --> 01:00:51,582
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a full-time development director, and he was doing a great job.

818
01:00:52,243 --> 01:00:52,903
[SPEAKER_05]: And now he's gone.

819
01:00:52,943 --> 01:00:55,365
[SPEAKER_05]: He's working in the private sector.

820
01:00:55,626 --> 01:00:57,587
[SPEAKER_05]: He's giving us 10 hours a month or 10 hours a week.

821
01:00:58,188 --> 01:00:59,389
[SPEAKER_05]: He's not a development director.

822
01:00:59,929 --> 01:01:02,632
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I love Victor, and I wish he was here full time.

823
01:01:04,112 --> 01:01:11,616
[SPEAKER_05]: But him working a full-time job and us calling, you know, him being on a phone call job, that's not the economic developer I want.

824
01:01:11,977 --> 01:01:14,018
[SPEAKER_05]: I want a full-time person there.

825
01:01:14,138 --> 01:01:15,719
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why we can't get out of our own way.

826
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:18,160
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

827
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:18,801
[SPEAKER_13]: President Ferris.

828
01:01:19,701 --> 01:01:20,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Madam President.

829
01:01:21,162 --> 01:01:24,744
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's two things here, right?

830
01:01:24,784 --> 01:01:25,825
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to speak to

831
01:01:29,648 --> 01:01:41,773
[SPEAKER_04]: who's leading on what, more than to say that I think this council is leading on development and planning and doing so directly in consultation with the office of development and planning development and sustainability.

832
01:01:43,134 --> 01:01:44,094
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's a couple of things.

833
01:01:44,134 --> 01:01:57,060
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Wellington, to be honest, I think so far the Medford Square, the Wellington air rights, the Medford Square parcels, I think a little more coordination with the council on before RFIs go out and before that would be very welcome.

834
01:01:58,393 --> 01:02:08,541
[SPEAKER_04]: I think on the flip side, you know, I wrote 12 pages of commentary that I forced a lot of people to read about the comprehensive plan that we spent two years working on.

835
01:02:09,942 --> 01:02:11,684
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a tool in front of us.

836
01:02:12,104 --> 01:02:15,947
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have the whole toolbox yet, but I just don't agree that we don't have a blueprint.

837
01:02:16,468 --> 01:02:21,692
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very clear from the two year process to develop the citywide comprehensive plan that is incredibly detailed.

838
01:02:22,170 --> 01:02:28,755
[SPEAKER_04]: that there is a vision for where the city is going that includes the Mystic Ave corridor, that includes Medford Square.

839
01:02:28,775 --> 01:02:31,978
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's all about squares and corridors and about our neighborhoods.

840
01:02:32,258 --> 01:02:41,125
[SPEAKER_04]: What we're talking about doing next is taking that vision and that blueprint and putting it into action through updating our zoning code.

841
01:02:41,885 --> 01:02:46,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Another way that we can put that into action is this tool in front of us by creating a specific

842
01:02:48,040 --> 01:03:08,518
[SPEAKER_04]: of money to support the things that are in the master plan for improving the infrastructure in Medford Square, but there's a blueprint that comprehensive plan is an incredibly detailed document that talks about where we want the city to go, what we want our corridors to look like what we want our squares to look like, and this is very much in line with that I spent a lot of time.

843
01:03:09,138 --> 01:03:18,741
[SPEAKER_04]: in meetings around the comprehensive plan that included people who had a variety of different ideological and political backgrounds, different viewpoints on what development should look like.

844
01:03:19,101 --> 01:03:24,163
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we reached a good blueprint that moves us in the direction of significant growth.

845
01:03:25,285 --> 01:03:26,705
[SPEAKER_04]: in a measured and reasonable way.

846
01:03:27,606 --> 01:03:30,726
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's what we're talking about using tools to do.

847
01:03:31,187 --> 01:03:35,148
[SPEAKER_04]: So I won't dispute, I've extended the metaphor, right?

848
01:03:35,488 --> 01:03:37,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Tool, toolbox, now I've added blueprint.

849
01:03:37,548 --> 01:03:43,910
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't dispute that the toolbox is not complete, but I think this tool serves the blueprint and that's why I support it.

850
01:03:44,410 --> 01:03:48,391
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the real place where the rubber is gonna meet the road here, quite literally,

851
01:03:49,422 --> 01:03:52,603
[SPEAKER_04]: is the zoning work that we need to do over the next two years.

852
01:03:53,663 --> 01:04:02,646
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm really looking forward to doing that because that's where we're going to take this larger comprehensive plan, the discussions of what should happen in squares and corridors.

853
01:04:03,086 --> 01:04:06,907
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're gonna say, here's what the zoning map is now gonna look like in these areas.

854
01:04:06,967 --> 01:04:09,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's what the building massing should look like in these areas.

855
01:04:09,948 --> 01:04:12,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's what uses should be allowed and not allowed in these areas.

856
01:04:12,909 --> 01:04:15,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's what additional density looks like

857
01:04:16,991 --> 01:04:24,958
[SPEAKER_04]: that's going to be a discussion, but I think there's a significant road map there, and that's why I feel comfortable going ahead at this time.

858
01:04:25,038 --> 01:04:26,640
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll second Councilor Collins's motion.

859
01:04:27,380 --> 01:04:27,700
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

860
01:04:28,801 --> 01:04:30,543
[SPEAKER_13]: Any further discussion from the council this time?

861
01:04:33,204 --> 01:04:33,884
[SPEAKER_13]: I will just be brief.

862
01:04:33,944 --> 01:04:35,465
[SPEAKER_13]: I know pretty much everything has been said.

863
01:04:35,665 --> 01:04:38,547
[SPEAKER_13]: Like Councilor Collins, Councilor Scarpelli said, I appreciate the debate.

864
01:04:38,587 --> 01:04:41,368
[SPEAKER_13]: I think there's a lot of really good points being made.

865
01:04:41,468 --> 01:04:47,791
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think what I go back to is that this is, as Vice Mayor Behr said, this is a tool, it's a signal, it's a funding source.

866
01:04:48,211 --> 01:04:52,493
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't change any of those plans for better or worse, however people feel about it.

867
01:04:52,994 --> 01:04:53,774
[SPEAKER_13]: It gives the council

868
01:04:54,539 --> 01:05:04,102
[SPEAKER_13]: some more power in directing funding sources and establishing the ordinance and requiring folks to come back to us to actually use money that will be gained from this change.

869
01:05:04,162 --> 01:05:09,623
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think it's something that there are things I think we'd all like to see, but I think it's a step in the right direction.

870
01:05:09,643 --> 01:05:11,204
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think hopefully it will drive investment.

871
01:05:11,244 --> 01:05:14,305
[SPEAKER_13]: And it is something that it can be changed, just not written in stone.

872
01:05:14,465 --> 01:05:18,706
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think it's something that's worth moving forward with at this time.

873
01:05:19,666 --> 01:05:22,447
[SPEAKER_13]: And I will go to Mr. Castagnetti on Zoom.

874
01:05:23,870 --> 01:05:27,513
[SPEAKER_13]: Any other members of the public who wish to speak, please raise your hand or come up to the podium.

875
01:05:28,694 --> 01:05:30,576
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Castagnetti, name and address for the record, please.

876
01:05:31,977 --> 01:05:34,199
[SPEAKER_12]: Andrew Castagnetti, Cushman Street Method Mass.

877
01:05:34,219 --> 01:05:36,081
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Council President.

878
01:05:38,002 --> 01:05:43,006
[SPEAKER_12]: If I may, I'd like to offer some historical information, according to me.

879
01:05:44,247 --> 01:05:47,450
[SPEAKER_12]: I recollect Route 93 was built in 1960.

880
01:05:52,188 --> 01:05:58,993
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't think it affected the square in any way, except for the eminent domain.

881
01:06:00,694 --> 01:06:09,340
[SPEAKER_12]: More importantly, in 1968, I graduated the old high school on Forest Street.

882
01:06:11,442 --> 01:06:15,024
[SPEAKER_12]: And two years later, my wife closed the school, 1970.

883
01:06:16,786 --> 01:06:21,329
[SPEAKER_12]: And they built a so-called new high school.

884
01:06:22,235 --> 01:06:43,049
[SPEAKER_12]: in West Medford in the woods, and in my opinion, it was a terrible political mistake because Medford Square, with our three grades, 10th, 11th, and 12th, the baby boomers, 800 per class, about 2,500 students, and we're lucky if we had $2 in our pockets.

885
01:06:45,190 --> 01:06:47,452
[SPEAKER_12]: However, we supported Method Cinema,

886
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:55,644
[SPEAKER_12]: Papa Gino's Joe's pool room, small ball bowling, where have advanced and God is the pewter pot.

887
01:06:56,345 --> 01:07:01,228
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know there was Woolworths and grants, but that's a day of a different age.

888
01:07:02,148 --> 01:07:04,230
[SPEAKER_12]: However, the square was vibrant.

889
01:07:05,030 --> 01:07:09,233
[SPEAKER_12]: There was a lot of action, including Joe's pool room below old Markey's office.

890
01:07:10,334 --> 01:07:15,597
[SPEAKER_12]: So that was a major mistake for the business of Medford Square, in my opinion.

891
01:07:16,798 --> 01:07:17,198
[SPEAKER_12]: Also,

892
01:07:18,987 --> 01:07:23,470
[SPEAKER_12]: I like to say, Councilor Caraviello was 100% right.

893
01:07:23,510 --> 01:07:32,275
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been saying this for over 30 years at your meetings, that basically we turned our back on the river.

894
01:07:34,156 --> 01:07:35,317
[SPEAKER_12]: Big mistake.

895
01:07:36,037 --> 01:07:44,182
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been to Georgetown, Virginia, used to be a ghetto until the Kennedy's moved in there, and now it's high-end place.

896
01:07:45,042 --> 01:07:53,226
[SPEAKER_12]: I they have all these beautiful pubs like bestsellers used to have, but their back have these beautiful porches on top of the river.

897
01:07:53,947 --> 01:07:55,287
[SPEAKER_12]: And all these beautiful lights.

898
01:07:55,888 --> 01:08:00,290
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, we should have not turned our backs on the river.

899
01:08:00,830 --> 01:08:05,753
[SPEAKER_12]: And furthermore, we built over 500 clipper ships in the city over 500.

900
01:08:07,374 --> 01:08:13,557
[SPEAKER_12]: And over 300 of those ships were longer than the football stadium.

901
01:08:14,222 --> 01:08:17,123
[SPEAKER_12]: Hormel Stadium, they're over 300 feet long.

902
01:08:17,964 --> 01:08:27,847
[SPEAKER_12]: And we don't have one lousy clipper ship or a miniature version on clipper ship drive, whether it's in the water or on the shoreline.

903
01:08:28,368 --> 01:08:34,750
[SPEAKER_12]: And to attract 50 people per busload coming in from Faneuil Hall is tourism.

904
01:08:35,911 --> 01:08:37,771
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that should get done.

905
01:08:38,872 --> 01:08:41,573
[SPEAKER_12]: Although Medford is a one horse town,

906
01:08:42,089 --> 01:08:45,590
[SPEAKER_12]: It's, it's, they think that they're a bedroom community.

907
01:08:46,651 --> 01:08:50,252
[SPEAKER_12]: And you're not going to make Harvard Square here, or Davis Square here.

908
01:08:50,732 --> 01:09:04,257
[SPEAKER_12]: But furthermore, why not bring the the underground subway from Station Landon and have it emerge on one of these parcels of lands next to the river, then you'd have the eternal stimulus, in my opinion.

909
01:09:05,658 --> 01:09:10,740
[SPEAKER_12]: However, also, instead of this diff thing, how about

910
01:09:12,068 --> 01:09:18,131
[SPEAKER_12]: have you done any requests for proposals from all these big developers to see what they think they would like to do?

911
01:09:18,151 --> 01:09:23,494
[SPEAKER_12]: And don't forget, we do own that land, the people, we the people own that land.

912
01:09:24,135 --> 01:09:25,956
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's all I have to say at this point.

913
01:09:29,958 --> 01:09:32,639
[SPEAKER_13]: Any other members of the public wish to speak?

914
01:09:35,180 --> 01:09:36,441
[SPEAKER_13]: Any further discussion from the council?

915
01:09:38,042 --> 01:09:42,644
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a motion from Councilor Collins to approve for first reading seconded by Vice President Bears.

916
01:09:43,464 --> 01:09:44,705
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

917
01:09:44,785 --> 01:09:47,486
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, sorry, I do see Pat.

918
01:09:47,986 --> 01:09:49,647
[SPEAKER_13]: Oops, go to, oh wait.

919
01:09:50,587 --> 01:09:51,247
[SPEAKER_13]: There we go, okay.

920
01:09:52,988 --> 01:09:53,668
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Bears.

921
01:09:54,728 --> 01:09:54,969
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

922
01:09:56,269 --> 01:09:57,309
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Caraviello.

923
01:09:57,470 --> 01:09:57,770
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

924
01:09:57,810 --> 01:10:00,091
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Collins.

925
01:10:00,371 --> 01:10:00,611
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

926
01:10:01,511 --> 01:10:02,011
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Mattox.

927
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:02,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

928
01:10:03,632 --> 01:10:05,533
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scarpello.

929
01:10:05,953 --> 01:10:06,093
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

930
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:08,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Tseng?

931
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:08,620
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

932
01:10:09,641 --> 01:10:10,241
[SPEAKER_07]: President Morocco?

933
01:10:10,581 --> 01:10:10,801
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

934
01:10:11,582 --> 01:10:14,183
[SPEAKER_13]: Five in the affirmative, one in the negative, one absent.

935
01:10:14,243 --> 01:10:15,944
[SPEAKER_13]: The motion passes for first reading.

936
01:10:19,325 --> 01:10:20,346
[SPEAKER_13]: Back to our regular.

937
01:10:22,716 --> 01:10:25,158
[SPEAKER_13]: of Business, as that was a suspension just for a specific paper.

938
01:10:25,979 --> 01:10:43,795
[SPEAKER_13]: Petitions, presentations, and similar papers, 23-411, to City Council President Nicole Merlin, honorable members of the City Council, from Office of Planning, Development, and Sustainability, regarding proposed planned development district reordinance amendment 13-20, Walkling Court, Medford 02155, parcel map number N-05-10.

939
01:10:46,077 --> 01:10:59,973
[SPEAKER_13]: Per the procedures outlined in section 94-9.2 PDD of the Medford Zoning Ordinance, the applicant, Medford Housing Authority, submitted a proposed amendment PDD for the site located at 1 and 3 through 20 Waltham Court, Medford Mass 02155, assessor's map

940
01:11:01,839 --> 01:11:05,442
[SPEAKER_13]: and 05-10 as shown on locus map PDD3.

941
01:11:05,802 --> 01:11:09,504
[SPEAKER_13]: The property is located in apartment one zoning district.

942
01:11:09,524 --> 01:11:23,313
[SPEAKER_13]: The applicant proposes zoning to align with a prospective project which would include 144 replacement affordable units and 54 new units of affordable residential units for senior and disabled household and 40 new affordable residential units for families.

943
01:11:23,874 --> 01:11:24,294
[SPEAKER_13]: President Rowe.

944
01:11:25,652 --> 01:11:26,153
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Collins.

945
01:11:26,513 --> 01:11:28,895
[SPEAKER_20]: Motion to waive the remainder of the reading for a brief summary.

946
01:11:29,636 --> 01:11:35,822
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion of Councilor Collins to waive the remainder of the reading for a brief summary from Director Hunt, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

947
01:11:35,842 --> 01:11:36,523
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

948
01:11:36,683 --> 01:11:36,843
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

949
01:11:37,283 --> 01:11:38,164
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

950
01:11:38,785 --> 01:11:39,486
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

951
01:11:39,526 --> 01:11:41,888
[SPEAKER_13]: Going to Director Hunt.

952
01:11:45,947 --> 01:11:47,588
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening Madam President again.

953
01:11:48,549 --> 01:11:50,791
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a planned development district.

954
01:11:50,831 --> 01:12:02,559
[SPEAKER_01]: This was something that was part of the new recodification of the zoning that the city council undertook to allow specific changes specifically needed for an

955
01:12:03,780 --> 01:12:09,682
[SPEAKER_01]: areas of the city to accommodate a particular project.

956
01:12:10,362 --> 01:12:12,502
[SPEAKER_01]: This one is from the Medford Housing Authority.

957
01:12:13,243 --> 01:12:14,363
[SPEAKER_01]: They are present this evening.

958
01:12:14,423 --> 01:12:16,783
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that you are all very familiar with this project.

959
01:12:17,284 --> 01:12:30,087
[SPEAKER_01]: This step is actually the zoning step where the City Council must, under state law, refer this zoning request to the Community Development Board for a public hearing.

960
01:12:30,787 --> 01:12:33,768
[SPEAKER_01]: and then an opinion back to this board.

961
01:12:34,349 --> 01:12:44,053
[SPEAKER_01]: At that time, the City Council would hold a public hearing, which would be the appropriate time to take public comments on it during the legally required public hearing on this project.

962
01:12:44,953 --> 01:12:48,415
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you also have the recommendation of the Community Development Board,

963
01:12:49,055 --> 01:12:49,595
[SPEAKER_01]: in hand.

964
01:12:50,496 --> 01:13:00,221
[SPEAKER_01]: So while you are welcome to ask questions and discuss this under state law, the City Council has to refer this to the City, to the Community Development Board this evening.

965
01:13:00,882 --> 01:13:02,322
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you like other information?

966
01:13:02,462 --> 01:13:10,727
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd hesitate to personally off the cuff summarize the project, but we do have MHA staff here tonight who could give you a summary if that was helpful.

967
01:13:11,803 --> 01:13:17,206
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we're good, I do see Councilor Collins, and I see Gabe Ciccariello on the call as well, if we have questions.

968
01:13:18,347 --> 01:13:18,847
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Collins?

969
01:13:19,728 --> 01:13:20,668
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, President Monroe.

970
01:13:20,808 --> 01:13:32,875
[SPEAKER_20]: I wouldn't wanna preclude any discussion at this point, but since this is just a procedural step, I would motion to refer the zoning amendment to the Community Development Board, pending further discussion, questions, summarization.

971
01:13:33,195 --> 01:13:37,598
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a motion from Councilor Collins to refer it to the Community Development Board, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

972
01:13:38,823 --> 01:13:45,248
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just going to say that we did just have a presentation, extensive presentation on the project just last week.

973
01:13:46,108 --> 01:13:54,314
[SPEAKER_04]: And if any residents are interested in the level of detail that we went into, those recordings are available from Medford Community Media, medfordtv.org.

974
01:13:54,874 --> 01:13:56,315
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

975
01:13:56,376 --> 01:14:03,120
[SPEAKER_13]: So on the motion of Councilor Collins to refer to the CD board, seconded by Councilor Caraviello, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

976
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:06,242
[SPEAKER_13]: Right away, Councilor Tseng, probably.

977

[SPEAKER_13]: The paper is referred to the Community Development Board.

[SPEAKER_13]: Petitioners and owners, Gerald L. Alves and Janet R. Alves, dear Mr. Hurtubise, I represent Gerald L. Alves and Janet R. Alves, who are the petitioners and are the owners of the property known as 12 Dell Avenue in Medford per a deed dated November 25th, 2013, and are recorded in the Middlesex South District Registry of Deeds in book

995
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:31,302
[SPEAKER_13]: 62994 page 140, a copy of which is enclosed with the petition as Exhibit A, the property.

996
01:15:31,742 --> 01:15:41,385
[SPEAKER_13]: The property in Medford Assessor's Parcel I-13 slash 50 is located in General Residence GR Zoning District and contains a single family house in which the petitioners reside.

997
01:15:42,605 --> 01:15:47,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Madam President, motion to waive the reading and have the attorney give an explanation.

1001
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:57,368
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Tseng, all those in favor?

[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

1004
01:15:58,889 --> 01:15:59,629
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

1005
01:15:59,749 --> 01:16:00,349
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll hand it over to you.

1006
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:03,971
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address for the record, if you could just tell us a little bit more about what's before us tonight.

1007
01:16:04,231 --> 01:16:04,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

1008
01:16:04,611 --> 01:16:04,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1009
01:16:04,971 --> 01:16:07,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Adam Dash, 48 Grove Street in Somerville.

1010
01:16:07,892 --> 01:16:11,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Madam President, evening councilors.

1011
01:16:11,794 --> 01:16:17,157
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here with Janet and Gerald Alves, who are the owners and the petitioners regarding 12 Dell Avenue.

1012
01:16:17,237 --> 01:16:24,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Also with us are Douglas Shoup, architect on the project, and William Lucas of Boulder Engineering, who's the senior project engineer, should there be any questions.

1013
01:16:25,446 --> 01:16:32,969
[SPEAKER_03]: So the Albs have filed a petition to amend a deed restriction regarding their property at 12 Dell Avenue, and the restriction is held by the city of Medford.

1014
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:35,790
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an unusual situation for sure.

1015
01:16:36,291 --> 01:16:38,232
[SPEAKER_03]: The property is very large.

1016
01:16:38,452 --> 01:16:43,774
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about 48,082 square foot lot, of which there's only a single family house on it.

1017
01:16:44,654 --> 01:16:46,915
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is the house that's occupied by the Albs' family.

1018
01:16:47,676 --> 01:16:51,597
[SPEAKER_03]: The city held deed restriction is from the city's 2008 sale of this property.

1019
01:16:53,679 --> 01:17:06,551
[SPEAKER_03]: And this allows only a single-family house to be built on the large property, prevents the property from being subdivided, and requires the single-family house to meet certain design requirements that were in the RFP when the city sold the property in 2008.

1020
01:17:08,413 --> 01:17:15,479
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to note the Alves were not the people who bought the property from the city, and they were not the developers who built the house.

1021
01:17:15,620 --> 01:17:18,462
[SPEAKER_03]: They are the current owners of the property who purchased it in 2013.

1022
01:17:20,372 --> 01:17:23,398
[SPEAKER_03]: The Albs are not asking to remove this restriction entirely.

1023
01:17:24,099 --> 01:17:27,246
[SPEAKER_03]: They're only asking it to be amended to allow them.

1024
01:17:27,922 --> 01:17:32,424
[SPEAKER_03]: to have that large property subdivided into two lots, which are still substantial.

1025
01:17:33,304 --> 01:17:37,746
[SPEAKER_03]: One will have the single family house still on it, and the other they would like to put three units on.

1026
01:17:38,186 --> 01:17:39,667
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's all that would happen to it.

1027
01:17:40,707 --> 01:17:53,453
[SPEAKER_03]: On the new vacant lot, to remove that mandate, also that the design requirements to the RFP from 2008 go away, because obviously those dealt with only a single family house, and they're completely irrelevant in this context.

1028
01:17:54,243 --> 01:17:59,426
[SPEAKER_03]: So the restriction would remain in place in all of the respects which would prevent any other development of this parcel.

1029
01:18:00,167 --> 01:18:08,232
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason for the Alves' request is that they're over 65 years of age, they have a disabled son, and Mr. Alves has a widowed sister.

1030
01:18:09,212 --> 01:18:16,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Janet Alves retired early as a registered nurse to care for her disabled adult son, who's now doing better and actually has a part-time service job.

1031
01:18:16,877 --> 01:18:18,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Still, he needs supervision and support.

1032
01:18:19,339 --> 01:18:20,920
[SPEAKER_03]: So by building a three-family,

1033
01:18:21,787 --> 01:18:24,588
[SPEAKER_03]: On that vacant lot, their son could live in one of the units.

1034
01:18:25,908 --> 01:18:28,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Alves' widowed sister could live in one of the units.

1035
01:18:28,788 --> 01:18:36,410
[SPEAKER_03]: The Alves could downsize from their large single-family house that's now too big for them into the third unit, and then they could sell the single-family house.

1036
01:18:36,950 --> 01:18:38,990
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all that's trying to be done here.

1037
01:18:39,671 --> 01:18:45,792
[SPEAKER_03]: The family can stay together in this way, and the Alves could look after their son, and the son could also live.

1038
01:18:46,112 --> 01:18:47,712
[SPEAKER_03]: If he needed a caregiver, could move in.

1039
01:18:48,012 --> 01:18:51,213
[SPEAKER_03]: The son also could have a quasi-independent situation.

1040
01:18:52,097 --> 01:19:09,218
[SPEAKER_03]: So the idea here is that amending the restriction not only helps the Owls family, it also helps the city by adding much-needed housing units, by providing building permit fees, by increasing the tax base, and by allowing a longtime Medford family to remain.

1041
01:19:10,627 --> 01:19:17,128
[SPEAKER_03]: My clients had architectural survey and engineering work done to ensure that dividing these two lots would allow this project to happen.

1042
01:19:18,068 --> 01:19:20,649
[SPEAKER_03]: We have been able to show that that can be done.

1043
01:19:20,669 --> 01:19:25,930
[SPEAKER_03]: We have filed with my application exhibits D and E would show sort of schematics of that.

1044
01:19:26,570 --> 01:19:34,931
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't gone and developed entire buildings because obviously it's a chicken and egg problem, whereas if the council will not amend the restriction, then there's no sense in going any further.

1045
01:19:35,271 --> 01:19:39,112
[SPEAKER_03]: But we've done the diligence to know that this is the next step that we need to be at.

1046
01:19:39,773 --> 01:19:50,578
[SPEAKER_03]: We've also spoken with various city departments and received comments and incorporated those comments into our thinking here, such as making sure the fire truck can get up Dell Avenue and turn around and access this, which you can.

1047
01:19:51,059 --> 01:19:52,779
[SPEAKER_03]: We filed a plan that shows that.

1048
01:19:53,540 --> 01:19:56,701
[SPEAKER_03]: So in short, this is really actually a pretty simple request to understand.

1049
01:19:57,742 --> 01:20:00,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, if the council agrees to amend the restriction,

1050
01:20:00,468 --> 01:20:11,173
[SPEAKER_03]: The owls would still have to go through a whole process to actually do something to build the three family and meet all relevant codes and such, as well as dealing with ledge that's on the site.

1051
01:20:11,873 --> 01:20:15,815
[SPEAKER_03]: However, without the deed restriction being amended, they can't even go to that next step.

1052
01:20:16,355 --> 01:20:21,338
[SPEAKER_03]: And allowing this amendment does not mean that you're allowing zoning relief or allowing a project or anything like that.

1053
01:20:21,358 --> 01:20:23,739
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just allowing them to begin that process.

1054
01:20:24,609 --> 01:20:30,610
[SPEAKER_03]: So since the petition was filed, I know the council has amended the zoning ordinance to allow greater than one principal structure on the lot.

1055
01:20:30,670 --> 01:20:36,711
[SPEAKER_03]: However, we're still seeking to do the subdivision so that single-family house is not legally tied to the three-family.

1056
01:20:36,771 --> 01:20:40,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, it would be kind of an awkward two-building condo situation.

1057
01:20:42,272 --> 01:20:53,574
[SPEAKER_03]: So I took the liberty of drafting an amendment document for recording at the Registry of Deeds and attached it to the petition as Exhibit C, should you be so inclined, just to approve the petition tonight or at some other point.

1058
01:20:54,477 --> 01:21:03,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Therefore, the Alves hope that you would help the city and their family and themselves by amending this restriction on the property at 12 Dell Avenue.

1059
01:21:03,283 --> 01:21:04,643
[SPEAKER_03]: We're here to answer any questions.

1060
01:21:04,944 --> 01:21:05,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1061
01:21:05,564 --> 01:21:05,904
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1062
01:21:06,565 --> 01:21:07,145
[SPEAKER_13]: President Ferris.

1063
01:21:08,466 --> 01:21:09,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Madam President.

1064
01:21:09,787 --> 01:21:17,351
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm interested in hearing from, um, the planning department and any other city folks online and our council.

1065
01:21:17,391 --> 01:21:19,233
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just have two quick questions.

1066
01:21:19,533 --> 01:21:20,754
[SPEAKER_04]: A Councilor dash.

1067
01:21:21,814 --> 01:21:22,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, one.

1068
01:21:23,948 --> 01:21:26,511
[SPEAKER_04]: the letter notes that you've received comments from offices.

1069
01:21:26,551 --> 01:21:28,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you received written comments from offices?

1070
01:21:29,334 --> 01:21:30,956
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we've had, I'm sorry, Adam Dasch again.

1071
01:21:30,976 --> 01:21:33,399
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had meetings via Zoom.

1072
01:21:33,879 --> 01:21:40,486
[SPEAKER_03]: We've spoken with the mayor's office, the community development folks, and we're planning now the fire department.

1073
01:21:40,506 --> 01:21:41,207
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had meetings.

1074
01:21:42,302 --> 01:21:43,823
[SPEAKER_03]: email plans back and forth.

1075
01:21:44,584 --> 01:21:53,510
[SPEAKER_03]: They've asked us, they can't really give us written responses if we don't actually file a formal application, which is typically how things go.

1076
01:21:53,571 --> 01:22:00,236
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're not at that step because again, if this amendment doesn't get, if this restriction doesn't get amended, we can't do anything else.

1077
01:22:02,077 --> 01:22:02,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1078
01:22:02,497 --> 01:22:11,324
[SPEAKER_04]: And then would all of you potentially be, you know, one of the questions here is the city sold land to the previous owner

1079
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:25,510
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, from what my review was pretty, I think it was about $80,000 for the lot, kind of under, because of the restrictions, understanding that, you know, if that lot were fully developed, well, I know it's difficult land.

1080
01:22:25,550 --> 01:22:27,231
[SPEAKER_04]: I live on Fellsbury West up the street.

1081
01:22:27,251 --> 01:22:34,777
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's not, you know, flat land, 48,000 square feet or anything like that, but conceivably, especially given the value of,

1082
01:22:35,857 --> 01:22:41,058
[SPEAKER_04]: land and housing today, someone could figure out a way to put quite a few number of units on that lot.

1083
01:22:41,598 --> 01:22:47,159
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that's not what you're asking for here, but it could be conceivable down the road.

1084
01:22:47,860 --> 01:22:55,061
[SPEAKER_04]: The restrictions were put on by the city in 2008 with that owner on the condition that there be one unit on a lot, one single family home.

1085
01:22:56,442 --> 01:23:02,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Would there be a consideration to making the three units deed restricted permanently affordable potentially?

1086
01:23:04,385 --> 01:23:11,449
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, while the idea, as I explained, for the family in there and the folks, I'm not sure that they necessarily would qualify for that.

1087
01:23:11,469 --> 01:23:12,690
[SPEAKER_03]: This might defeat the purpose.

1088
01:23:12,750 --> 01:23:15,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Certainly, as I said, we're not looking to remove the restriction.

1089
01:23:16,011 --> 01:23:19,293
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just seeking to amend it to just allow this one thing and nothing else.

1090
01:23:19,353 --> 01:23:22,575
[SPEAKER_03]: So obviously, 48,000 square feet, if one could deal with the ledge.

1091
01:23:23,059 --> 01:23:25,080
[SPEAKER_03]: One could build a lot of units, and we understand that.

1092
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:26,981
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not proposing that at all.

1093
01:23:27,021 --> 01:23:30,523
[SPEAKER_03]: The city would still, you would still withhold that restriction in place.

1094
01:23:30,823 --> 01:23:32,024
[SPEAKER_03]: The restriction will exist.

1095
01:23:32,924 --> 01:23:37,226
[SPEAKER_03]: How it happened in 2008 with the one unit, it was a ledge lot.

1096
01:23:37,266 --> 01:23:39,248
[SPEAKER_03]: I would imagine the construction was quite costly.

1097
01:23:39,348 --> 01:23:40,708
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what happened back then.

1098
01:23:41,449 --> 01:23:44,931
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually looked through the city records to find out what happened in 2008.

1099
01:23:45,171 --> 01:23:47,652
[SPEAKER_03]: I could not get an answer as to why this happened.

1100
01:23:48,752 --> 01:23:50,754
[SPEAKER_03]: and why the restriction was put on in this manner.

1101
01:23:51,134 --> 01:23:56,357
[SPEAKER_03]: However, it's there, and it is, and I guess at some point the why doesn't matter anymore, because it's been such a long time.

1102
01:23:56,998 --> 01:24:04,823
[SPEAKER_03]: However, the Alves are in a bit of a situation here where they have this very massive lot with this one house on it, and it's a little too big for them.

1103
01:24:05,744 --> 01:24:07,365
[SPEAKER_03]: And they'd like to stay in the neighborhood.

1104
01:24:07,842 --> 01:24:24,631
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a way to stay in the neighborhood and deal with their internal family issues without overburdening the city, but still having a few extra units, which help in the long run with the city providing more housing in a way that we feel is manageable and not overly intrusive on the neighborhood there are three units around.

1105
01:24:25,131 --> 01:24:28,393
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not as though this would be some anomaly in the district.

1106
01:24:29,068 --> 01:24:30,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm not a lawyer.

1107
01:24:30,750 --> 01:24:38,218
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think on balance, the story and the explanation of why this would this request is coming before us certainly makes sense.

1108
01:24:39,359 --> 01:24:43,904
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess just more my question is, and you know, feel free to just keep it as a bug in your ear.

1109
01:24:43,964 --> 01:24:47,628
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sure there'll be a lot of other conversations with city departments and officials, but

1110
01:24:48,393 --> 01:24:52,376
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear what you're saying, maybe they don't qualify for the affordability restriction now.

1111
01:24:53,016 --> 01:25:07,105
[SPEAKER_04]: If it were possible to make it conditional that if the property were ever to be sold in the future, I don't know if it's possible to say that, put that condition on, that if there was a future sale that the units would be affordable after that point, something like that.

1112
01:25:07,145 --> 01:25:07,885
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that would be...

1113
01:25:11,407 --> 01:25:19,250
[SPEAKER_04]: hopefully a little more in line with the initial restriction while still fulfilling the purpose that the family would like to see.

1114
01:25:19,550 --> 01:25:21,771
[SPEAKER_04]: So just want to put that in as an idea.

1115
01:25:21,871 --> 01:25:26,933
[SPEAKER_04]: But other than that, I'll leave it as is and wait to hear from other councillors and from city staff.

1116
01:25:27,174 --> 01:25:27,394
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1117
01:25:27,414 --> 01:25:30,355
[SPEAKER_13]: And I do want to note that we have Attorney Everett from KP Law on the call as well.

1118
01:25:31,266 --> 01:25:33,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, sir.

1119
01:25:33,427 --> 01:25:44,553
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, I was appreciate you mentioning that be nice that two years ago, we used to have a city solicitor that we can have here and help us as we go through this process.

1120
01:25:45,054 --> 01:25:48,655
[SPEAKER_06]: I had no idea that KP law would be here to help us along.

1121
01:25:48,715 --> 01:25:52,137
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're talking about a very

1122
01:25:54,287 --> 01:25:56,089
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, different situation.

1123
01:25:56,929 --> 01:26:03,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and I think that all we're asking for right now is just the opportunity to go to the next step.

1124
01:26:03,174 --> 01:26:14,843
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, the questions that people have in neighborhoods is, you know, as valiant as your, your, your, your heart and what you need is something that I would support in a second.

1125
01:26:15,243 --> 01:26:15,904
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see that.

1126
01:26:16,684 --> 01:26:21,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, this is something you took a chance on that land, but as your family grew,

1127
01:26:22,431 --> 01:26:23,592
[SPEAKER_06]: to be a strong member of our community.

1128
01:26:23,612 --> 01:26:29,857
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we've had a lot of obstacles and hurdles come in the way and you still want to be a strong member of our community with your family, and, um.

1129
01:26:30,697 --> 01:26:33,359
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we should support this this evening and move it along.

1130
01:26:33,399 --> 01:26:35,361
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that they'll be hurdles along the way.

1131
01:26:35,381 --> 01:26:39,344
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll be neighbors that are going to be mad about breaking ledge.

1132
01:26:39,364 --> 01:26:45,028
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll be neighbors questioning parking, and there's going to be questions about affordable

1133
01:26:52,712 --> 01:27:02,762
[SPEAKER_06]: If that's the question that we're just trying to move something down the road so we can maybe help a family that's in need right now, I think that we'd be.

1134
01:27:04,990 --> 01:27:08,053
[SPEAKER_06]: We'd be speaking for myself.

1135
01:27:08,093 --> 01:27:13,038
[SPEAKER_06]: I would be foolish not to support a family that is looking for that support in Medford.

1136
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:18,484
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, we're not giving approval to build the Taj Mahal all we're looking for.

1137
01:27:18,945 --> 01:27:23,790
[SPEAKER_06]: Council is asking for the family that we help them move on to the next step and then

1138
01:27:24,270 --> 01:27:24,990
[SPEAKER_06]: we go from there.

1139
01:27:25,030 --> 01:27:25,991
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's a no brainer.

1140
01:27:26,031 --> 01:27:34,534
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would move, um, if there is a motion that we need that I would move that forward this motion forward to, uh, to the next level.

1141
01:27:34,794 --> 01:27:39,736
[SPEAKER_06]: So the house family can see if they can, um, support their family concerns.

1142
01:27:39,836 --> 01:27:40,916
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you, Madam President.

1143
01:27:41,136 --> 01:27:42,317
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Carvejo.

1144
01:27:43,008 --> 01:27:45,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Madam President, to the chair, to the attorney.

1145
01:27:45,390 --> 01:27:48,353
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's currently a single family house there, correct?

1146
01:27:48,953 --> 01:27:52,997
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're looking to build a second three-family structure.

1147
01:27:53,798 --> 01:27:57,401
[SPEAKER_05]: Would that be like a townhouse type?

1148
01:27:57,421 --> 01:27:59,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, that's what we're showing right now, yes.

1149
01:27:59,503 --> 01:28:00,463
[SPEAKER_05]: That lays out on the lot.

1150
01:28:00,744 --> 01:28:01,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1151
01:28:01,444 --> 01:28:07,770
[SPEAKER_05]: And is there a road that we have to, are you going to have to improve the roadway?

1152
01:28:08,247 --> 01:28:08,387
[SPEAKER_05]: and a

1153
01:28:28,102 --> 01:28:30,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Lucas here is the engineer, so that might be better.

1154
01:28:31,044 --> 01:28:43,874
[SPEAKER_03]: I would note that just for the record, it's Adam Dasch again, that we, there's a certain level of development that we've done an investigation and we kind of stopped because this restriction sort of, how much money do the Alves want to spend if this is a no-go at this stage?

1155
01:28:43,894 --> 01:28:45,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Because then the whole thing goes away.

1156
01:28:45,095 --> 01:28:47,077
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's sort of a chicken and egg.

1157
01:28:47,237 --> 01:28:57,805
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess my, before you, so if we approve this this evening and it moves forward, what happens if you're not able to get the necessary permits from,

1158
01:29:00,859 --> 01:29:02,580
[SPEAKER_05]: the different departments, what happens then?

1159
01:29:02,840 --> 01:29:04,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Then the project doesn't happen.

1160
01:29:04,921 --> 01:29:07,522
[SPEAKER_05]: So what happens to the deed restriction that's on there that we're gonna be giving?

1161
01:29:07,542 --> 01:29:16,446
[SPEAKER_03]: The deed restriction would be amended as we've discussed and somebody maybe in the future could try to build a three-family there, but that would be, it would still be subdividable into two lots.

1162
01:29:16,987 --> 01:29:20,588
[SPEAKER_03]: One could have a three-family on it and that they don't build it.

1163
01:29:22,096 --> 01:29:28,218
[SPEAKER_06]: point of information for the ASKP law that if we amend this, that it would go with just the Alves family.

1164
01:29:28,378 --> 01:29:34,879
[SPEAKER_06]: If it is transferred over, then that would, that restriction would have to come before the city council again at the time.

1165
01:29:35,160 --> 01:29:36,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think that's an easy ask.

1166
01:29:36,520 --> 01:29:37,000
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that.

1167
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:40,941
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I mean, can you provide clarity on that?

1168
01:29:42,401 --> 01:29:51,404
[SPEAKER_13]: If we were to, if the council were to amend their restriction and then they weren't able to get their sufficient permits, then that amendment would stand and we would have to change it back.

1169
01:29:52,193 --> 01:29:59,519
[SPEAKER_06]: if we didn't want some developer to come in and put a ton of... Or we allow it to what the Alves family, the existing owner right now only.

1170
01:29:59,539 --> 01:30:00,560
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, right.

1171
01:30:00,620 --> 01:30:04,142
[SPEAKER_13]: Would it stay with the family or did it stay with the company?

1172
01:30:04,162 --> 01:30:05,023
[SPEAKER_13]: How could we restrict that?

1173
01:30:07,025 --> 01:30:19,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you could hold the restriction, the amendment to the restriction in escrow until they get their permits so that it's not reported until we know for sure that they can construct the second unit.

1174
01:30:20,729 --> 01:30:21,970
[SPEAKER_02]: and subdivide the property.

1175
01:30:22,150 --> 01:30:23,430
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one way of doing this.

1176
01:30:25,531 --> 01:30:33,555
[SPEAKER_02]: The other way is, of course, if we put it on record, then we'll have to request the owners to give us a new restriction.

1177
01:30:34,415 --> 01:30:36,016
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not sure if that's what you want.

1178
01:30:36,076 --> 01:30:45,060
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the third option, of course, is to record the restriction and have the future owners benefit from that amendment.

1179
01:30:47,762 --> 01:30:50,103
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, Matt, if we can, for clarity purposes,

1180
01:30:51,230 --> 01:31:09,865
[SPEAKER_06]: for the simpletons in the room like myself, to the attorney, is it possible to grant the Owls family only for this purpose and not for the property or future property owners?

1181
01:31:11,246 --> 01:31:11,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we can do that.

1182
01:31:12,968 --> 01:31:13,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.

1183
01:31:13,948 --> 01:31:14,389
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's do that.

1184
01:31:14,950 --> 01:31:24,718
[SPEAKER_03]: I would note just for the record, uh, if it's, if it's built, because obviously once the three families built and the albums, let's say at some point in the future, they're no longer there.

1185
01:31:24,758 --> 01:31:26,260
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't take the three families back.

1186
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:26,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1187
01:31:27,020 --> 01:31:30,223
[SPEAKER_06]: No, again, this is just to build the process to go through the next step.

1188
01:31:30,443 --> 01:31:31,264
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1189
01:31:31,324 --> 01:31:31,784
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1190
01:31:31,824 --> 01:31:40,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that, that goes back to my question is, is what, you know, what happens after the fact, uh, maybe attorney Everett, you could, um,

1191
01:31:43,830 --> 01:31:46,171
[SPEAKER_04]: provide some guidance on that question.

1192
01:31:46,211 --> 01:31:56,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it possible to amend the restriction so that upon sale of the property, the units would be permanently affordable units?

1193
01:31:56,417 --> 01:31:57,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that possible?

1194
01:31:58,658 --> 01:32:02,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, if the owners are amenable to that, we could put that in the deed restriction.

1195
01:32:03,640 --> 01:32:10,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, because that's, you know, I think that would be something that I would be interested in, because I think, you know, there's one question of

1196
01:32:13,147 --> 01:32:26,057
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, just adding housing stock generally, I think, you know, in this set of purposes, it makes sense, you know, to allow a change in this deed restriction to allow the three family to be built.

1197
01:32:26,558 --> 01:32:36,426
[SPEAKER_04]: In the future, I think we would want the building to serve similar purposes, which would be to serve people who need that kind of supportive housing, right?

1198
01:32:36,586 --> 01:32:38,127
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what we're doing here for this family.

1199
01:32:38,147 --> 01:32:41,670
[SPEAKER_04]: I think in the future, we'd want that to continue for a future owner.

1200
01:32:42,864 --> 01:33:00,367
[SPEAKER_06]: One information, and again, but this is my, this is dilemma, the chicken, the egg kind of my, my concern would be the Alps families taking all the risks they're paying all the upfront they're doing, they're moving this for their family forward.

1201
01:33:00,888 --> 01:33:08,409
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, as they move forward to restrict it and limit them for what they can, they can make on that part of their property.

1202
01:33:09,206 --> 01:33:10,407
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's a slippery slope.

1203
01:33:10,447 --> 01:33:12,968
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's already limited to none.

1204
01:33:14,368 --> 01:33:29,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm saying as you move forward, you also have a family that they just explained how, you know, as their family's growing with some need to restrict their possibility of greater growth to support their family.

1205
01:33:29,755 --> 01:33:34,898
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's, you know, that's a question that I'd have with that.

1206
01:33:35,938 --> 01:33:37,699
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, that's why we're here.

1207
01:33:38,625 --> 01:33:45,827
[SPEAKER_13]: I do want to go to senior planner, Danielle Evans has had her hand up too, and she might be able to provide some more insight.

1208
01:33:46,347 --> 01:33:47,608
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll go to you, Danielle.

1209
01:33:49,788 --> 01:33:50,288
[SPEAKER_18]: Good evening.

1210
01:33:50,388 --> 01:33:53,889
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Madam President, Danielle Evans, senior planner.

1211
01:33:54,770 --> 01:33:57,050
[SPEAKER_18]: We did look into this earlier in the summer.

1212
01:33:57,070 --> 01:34:06,153
[SPEAKER_18]: I think some more research needs to be done because I would like to get my hands on a copy of the RFP to get a better understanding of the reason for

1213
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:18,486
[SPEAKER_18]: The restriction with records retention timelines, it's possible that we don't have it in a file on site.

1214
01:34:18,547 --> 01:34:26,351
[SPEAKER_18]: But I really think that we should be able to look at this further before making any votes.

1215
01:34:28,268 --> 01:34:32,992
[SPEAKER_18]: Just some of my cursory research, it was sold for very little money.

1216
01:34:34,633 --> 01:34:38,977
[SPEAKER_18]: What happened in the past was the city used to sell land to plug budget holes.

1217
01:34:39,597 --> 01:34:42,199
[SPEAKER_18]: And I guess this was land that was available.

1218
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:48,484
[SPEAKER_18]: They sold it at what it would be valued at if only a single family could be developed on it.

1219
01:34:48,505 --> 01:34:54,930
[SPEAKER_18]: It was sold to a developer, who in turn sold it as a single family for whatever price it would be with that deed restriction.

1220
01:34:57,752 --> 01:35:12,078
[SPEAKER_18]: So regardless of the property owner now and their reason for what they want to do, because usually we look at the request, not the reason why, because we can't hold them to it.

1221
01:35:12,539 --> 01:35:26,805
[SPEAKER_18]: They could get the deed restriction removed so that they could now subdivide the property to four, five lots if they want, and sell it to whoever they want.

1222
01:35:27,452 --> 01:35:38,934
[SPEAKER_18]: So that ends up becoming a windfall for a private developer without much public good and is indeed restricted affordable.

1223
01:35:39,314 --> 01:35:48,095
[SPEAKER_06]: Point of information, I know, but you're making this as if these were developers and I can understand that fight, but these aren't developers.

1224
01:35:48,596 --> 01:35:51,976
[SPEAKER_06]: These are residents that have lived in this community.

1225
01:35:51,996 --> 01:35:54,277
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I think there is a difference.

1226
01:35:54,837 --> 01:35:55,597
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and I think the,

1227
01:35:57,551 --> 01:36:00,352
[SPEAKER_06]: the situation plays a huge factor in my decision.

1228
01:36:01,132 --> 01:36:10,935
[SPEAKER_06]: So I wouldn't, like I said, I would move approval for the deed restriction to be lifted so we can move forward with this and that it stays with the Alves family.

1229
01:36:11,855 --> 01:36:15,536
[SPEAKER_06]: That if it's changed after that, that then it has to come back to this council.

1230
01:36:16,796 --> 01:36:17,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1231
01:36:17,476 --> 01:36:17,776
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1232
01:36:18,076 --> 01:36:18,717
[SPEAKER_13]: You want to make that?

1233
01:36:18,957 --> 01:36:19,317
[SPEAKER_06]: I did.

1234
01:36:19,357 --> 01:36:19,877
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, please.

1235
01:36:23,398 --> 01:36:23,478
[SPEAKER_13]: Um,

1236
01:36:25,206 --> 01:36:27,547
[SPEAKER_13]: Any additional discussion from the council at this time?

1237
01:36:27,607 --> 01:36:29,088
[SPEAKER_13]: I do see Director Hunter hand up.

1238
01:36:29,769 --> 01:36:30,869
[SPEAKER_08]: Here she is.

1239
01:36:30,929 --> 01:36:32,330
[SPEAKER_13]: Director Hunter, over to you.

1240
01:36:34,071 --> 01:36:35,992
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Madam President.

1241
01:36:36,713 --> 01:36:43,236
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not sure if Danielle was done with her comments when she was interrupted.

1242
01:36:43,897 --> 01:36:50,821
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do want to, it would be our advice to not move on this tonight, to lay this on the table so that you could get further details.

1243
01:36:51,401 --> 01:37:05,324
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that we've talked about would be the potential to actually have an executive session meeting about this, because this is about money and the value of property and the property value of a deed restriction to the city.

1244
01:37:06,204 --> 01:37:09,005
[SPEAKER_01]: And that should not be discussed in an open public meeting.

1245
01:37:09,085 --> 01:37:11,085
[SPEAKER_01]: We could do that in an executive session.

1246
01:37:12,165 --> 01:37:19,367
[SPEAKER_01]: I also have not actually, I was not aware of this proposal until about two weeks ago, maybe less actually.

1247
01:37:20,367 --> 01:37:24,269
[SPEAKER_01]: It came into our office about the same time it went onto the agenda last week.

1248
01:37:24,669 --> 01:37:26,170
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it was two weeks, I apologize.

1249
01:37:27,911 --> 01:37:35,234
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm concerned about what would be needed for a subdivision, how they could legally separate these into multiple parcels.

1250
01:37:35,835 --> 01:37:38,596
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a conversation with our fire chief about this.

1251
01:37:39,496 --> 01:37:42,418
[SPEAKER_01]: He said he was only comfortable with this project.

1252
01:37:43,038 --> 01:37:48,044
[SPEAKER_01]: If it involved the removal of a lot of ledge so that he could turn around a fire truck up there.

1253
01:37:48,564 --> 01:37:55,492
[SPEAKER_01]: He has very, this is not an easy road for him to get a fire truck up right now, and he would want improvements to the road.

1254
01:37:55,852 --> 01:38:01,879
[SPEAKER_01]: So there may actually be problems to this project that go beyond just the subdivision.

1255
01:38:02,900 --> 01:38:16,673
[SPEAKER_01]: We are in favor of additional housing and additional affordable housing in Medford and putting a deed restriction on this, if all of those things could be surmounted, should not prevent them.

1256
01:38:16,934 --> 01:38:20,877
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the family just explained how they had a disabled son they would want to have

1257
01:38:22,038 --> 01:38:40,003
[SPEAKER_01]: adult son in one of the units, I would be stunned if he was not eligible for a deed-restricted affordable unit, as would an, I think it was portrayed as an older retired woman as well, would be eligible for a deed-restricted affordable unit.

1258
01:38:41,223 --> 01:38:45,684
[SPEAKER_01]: it might actually be a reasonable way for the city to add some affordable units to the city.

1259
01:38:46,444 --> 01:38:50,766
[SPEAKER_01]: If it came with those restrictions, we would want to discuss those offline with the attorney.

1260
01:38:52,206 --> 01:39:03,869
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do think that we definitely need to clarify before we waste anybody's time if there is a solution here that the fire chief is comfortable with short of clearing ledge.

1261
01:39:04,349 --> 01:39:07,410
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that's the only option, is the family

1262
01:39:08,509 --> 01:39:11,551
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in pursuing it if that's a requirement of the project.

1263
01:39:11,952 --> 01:39:14,654
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I don't think we should vote on this this evening.

1264
01:39:14,995 --> 01:39:21,601
[SPEAKER_01]: We would need to incorporate all the legal language for any sort of restrictions into the motion in front of you.

1265
01:39:26,005 --> 01:39:26,766
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate that.

1266
01:39:26,786 --> 01:39:31,130
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish we had that much fire for developers that are destroying our communities.

1267
01:39:31,550 --> 01:39:32,331
[SPEAKER_06]: But I will tell you,

1268
01:39:34,896 --> 01:39:39,059
[SPEAKER_06]: What I'm hearing right now, this is the process to move it forward.

1269
01:39:39,079 --> 01:39:47,005
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we could discuss with the fire department about what's needed or if it's even possible to move forward with this.

1270
01:39:47,085 --> 01:39:57,273
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is a simple ask that would move this family's worries into a better direction and we'd get some answers that way.

1271
01:39:57,834 --> 01:40:00,135
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving this to another meeting is just,

1272
01:40:03,095 --> 01:40:11,400
[SPEAKER_06]: making this longer than it should considering all the processes that you just talked about can be moved into the next phase as we move forward.

1273
01:40:11,420 --> 01:40:15,722
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe I don't think this is anything that that's groundbreaking.

1274
01:40:17,733 --> 01:40:41,358
[SPEAKER_06]: if we vote this forward tonight, that can't be adjusted as it moves forward for all of the different hurdles that residents have to go through when they're looking to, I believe it was support a family member, not moving him or them to outside services or into housing, but they want to look to take care of their own

1275
01:40:42,602 --> 01:40:50,729
[SPEAKER_06]: on their own property and the property that they're requesting and without the burden to anybody else.

1276
01:40:50,789 --> 01:40:56,374
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's valuable and I would still support it.

1277
01:40:56,414 --> 01:40:58,135
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have a motion on the floor, Madam President.

1278
01:40:59,136 --> 01:40:59,477
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1279
01:40:59,817 --> 01:41:00,097
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1280
01:41:00,157 --> 01:41:00,918
[SPEAKER_13]: You do have a motion.

1281
01:41:00,938 --> 01:41:01,698
[SPEAKER_13]: I need a second.

1282
01:41:01,718 --> 01:41:02,759
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a second for that?

1283
01:41:02,859 --> 01:41:03,340
[SPEAKER_13]: I do.

1284
01:41:03,460 --> 01:41:07,744
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't have the restriction of method language in front of us, so that would need to be.

1285
01:41:08,692 --> 01:41:11,194
[SPEAKER_13]: writing for us to approve anything?

1286
01:41:11,214 --> 01:41:14,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Madam President, I did attach it as an exhibit to the petition.

1287
01:41:15,359 --> 01:41:15,639
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1288
01:41:15,959 --> 01:41:17,401
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't have it.

1289
01:41:17,421 --> 01:41:20,504
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Collins, Vice Chair.

1290
01:41:22,906 --> 01:41:23,987
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, President Morell.

1291
01:41:24,147 --> 01:41:29,532
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm, um, I'd like to hear what my other fellow councilors have to say.

1292
01:41:30,373 --> 01:41:30,934
[SPEAKER_20]: I, um,

1293
01:41:32,294 --> 01:41:37,956
[SPEAKER_20]: I really appreciate the extremely compelling presentation from Attorney Dash, and thank you so much to the Alice family for being here.

1294
01:41:40,117 --> 01:41:47,800
[SPEAKER_20]: Certainly, the purpose for which you're seeking this deed amendment is, you know, I think it really speaks for itself.

1295
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:50,440
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that's really in the spirit of what this council wants to do.

1296
01:41:53,903 --> 01:42:01,649
[SPEAKER_20]: I see Director Hunt's concerns, and I think that one thing that's very appealing to me is thinking through this process, which is complicated.

1297
01:42:01,729 --> 01:42:05,112
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't think that a deed amendment has come before me in my term on the Council before.

1298
01:42:05,152 --> 01:42:06,353
[SPEAKER_20]: I feel like I would appreciate

1299
01:42:07,018 --> 01:42:15,423
[SPEAKER_20]: a little more chance to get into the weeds with Director Hunt, perhaps to make sure that we are taking this opportunity and optimizing it.

1300
01:42:15,543 --> 01:42:17,244
[SPEAKER_20]: I would like to have that conversation.

1301
01:42:17,504 --> 01:42:18,665
[SPEAKER_20]: I know that we have a motion on the floor.

1302
01:42:18,745 --> 01:42:27,170
[SPEAKER_20]: I would make a motion to perhaps refer this to the committee of the whole, with all haste, to meet on this, to meet with all relevant department heads.

1303
01:42:27,670 --> 01:42:30,271
[SPEAKER_20]: I would like to make sure that I have a full grasp of the situation before

1304
01:42:31,392 --> 01:42:32,353
[SPEAKER_20]: quickly taking a vote.

1305
01:42:32,853 --> 01:42:38,918
[SPEAKER_20]: And I will say if what comes out of that conversation is the best case scenario is just to approve the deed amendment as written.

1306
01:42:40,360 --> 01:42:41,761
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll take that vote, absolutely.

1307
01:42:42,201 --> 01:42:45,904
[SPEAKER_20]: I think I would just appreciate a more in-depth conversation about it before we take that vote.

1308
01:42:45,924 --> 01:42:49,047
[SPEAKER_20]: So I know we have a motion on the table, on the floor.

1309
01:42:49,547 --> 01:42:53,511
[SPEAKER_20]: If we didn't, I would make the motion to refer this to committee of the whole and then back to a regular meeting too.

1310
01:42:55,673 --> 01:42:57,174
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a motion in need of a second.

1311
01:42:57,694 --> 01:42:58,875
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll go to Vice President Bears.

1312
01:43:00,216 --> 01:43:00,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Madam President.

1313
01:43:01,017 --> 01:43:11,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, to be quite frank, the deed restriction, if we lift the deed restriction now, the deed restriction was put in place to protect the public interest relative to the sale of public land.

1314
01:43:12,564 --> 01:43:16,667
[SPEAKER_04]: We now have a request to amend the deed restriction for a very compelling private interest.

1315
01:43:17,507 --> 01:43:19,588
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree it's a very compelling private interest.

1316
01:43:20,649 --> 01:43:24,752
[SPEAKER_04]: I think what we need to do is balance the public interest and the private interest to

1317
01:43:26,213 --> 01:43:38,736
[SPEAKER_04]: achieve the outcome of the private request of the owner of the property without completely, without a significant reduction in the protection of the public interest that the deed restriction had.

1318
01:43:39,357 --> 01:43:42,838
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that we tonight have the information that we need to do that.

1319
01:43:44,058 --> 01:43:48,199
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't, I mean, you know, we're all, we're delaying everything else to talk to lawyers.

1320
01:43:48,239 --> 01:43:49,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we should delay this one too.

1321
01:43:54,161 --> 01:43:54,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know.

1322
01:43:57,675 --> 01:44:02,797
[SPEAKER_04]: The deed restriction was put in place to protect the public interest.

1323
01:44:03,077 --> 01:44:11,699
[SPEAKER_04]: The purpose of it was that this land was supposed to be for one single family home, and we're trying to change the deal here, right?

1324
01:44:11,719 --> 01:44:14,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, there's a good reason to change the deal, but that was the deal.

1325
01:44:15,060 --> 01:44:19,322
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's also the risk the private owner took when they purchased the property with the deed restriction on it.

1326
01:44:19,762 --> 01:44:23,103
[SPEAKER_04]: So we should discuss that in good faith and in an open and honest way.

1327
01:44:25,083 --> 01:44:34,025
[SPEAKER_04]: And if part of the discussion here is how do we have a good public interest outcome that also achieves the private outcome that the interested party wants, I think that's the best course of action.

1328
01:44:34,605 --> 01:44:40,686
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that that is where we're going to end up if we just vote to accept the proposal without further discussion from the experts.

1329
01:44:41,906 --> 01:44:49,248
[SPEAKER_04]: So I personally would ask for, I have a third idea.

1330
01:44:49,288 --> 01:44:50,488
[SPEAKER_04]: There's three motions on the floor.

1331
01:44:50,528 --> 01:44:51,668
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a motion to approve.

1332
01:44:51,708 --> 01:44:52,809
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a motion to have committee of the whole.

1333
01:44:55,097 --> 01:45:08,405
[SPEAKER_04]: the planning department, legal counsel for the city and legal counsel for the petitioner, sit and meet and see if there's an agreement that can be made that satisfies the interests of all parties involved.

1334
01:45:08,845 --> 01:45:12,287
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we can discuss that proposal when it comes back before us.

1335
01:45:13,147 --> 01:45:14,428
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the motion that I'll put on the floor.

1336
01:45:15,655 --> 01:45:16,215
[SPEAKER_13]: You're in the queue.

1337
01:45:16,696 --> 01:45:19,918
[SPEAKER_13]: If I could from the chair, I appreciate the discussion.

1338
01:45:19,938 --> 01:45:25,522
[SPEAKER_13]: I think knowing this council, I don't think this is something that any Councilor is like vehemently against.

1339
01:45:25,642 --> 01:45:31,086
[SPEAKER_13]: I think speaking for myself, I don't feel comfortable voting for this tonight just because I'd like to get more information.

1340
01:45:31,206 --> 01:45:37,371
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, before we vote for established businesses to have hours, we get a report from the fire department, we get a report from the board of health.

1341
01:45:37,471 --> 01:45:39,652
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just looking for that information to have a force.

1342
01:45:39,672 --> 01:45:41,334
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't have that before us right now.

1343
01:45:41,774 --> 01:45:43,095
[SPEAKER_13]: I understand the reasons why you've said,

1344
01:45:43,623 --> 01:45:50,086
[SPEAKER_13]: I would just like to have a little more information as Councilor Collins says, this is my first time having indeed restriction amendment before me.

1345
01:45:50,206 --> 01:45:56,849
[SPEAKER_13]: So I would just, you know, I could see laying on the table to revisit in two weeks or as soon as we get that information or whatever motion.

1346
01:45:57,443 --> 01:45:58,003
[SPEAKER_13]: does pass.

1347
01:45:58,463 --> 01:46:01,865
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Scarpelli, I don't know how people will vote.

1348
01:46:02,105 --> 01:46:03,766
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm judging from the conversation.

1349
01:46:03,786 --> 01:46:08,968
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't want your motion to go forward and fail and then we can't hear this again for 90 days.

1350
01:46:09,128 --> 01:46:10,249
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just want to make that note.

1351
01:46:10,309 --> 01:46:11,249
[SPEAKER_13]: It still needs a second.

1352
01:46:12,590 --> 01:46:13,430
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's where I stand again.

1353
01:46:13,490 --> 01:46:14,391
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not against this.

1354
01:46:14,491 --> 01:46:16,011
[SPEAKER_13]: I would just like a little bit more information.

1355
01:46:16,211 --> 01:46:17,312
[SPEAKER_13]: I do want to point out one

1356
01:46:18,012 --> 01:46:21,773
[SPEAKER_13]: small to largest thing is the ledge of the property.

1357
01:46:21,813 --> 01:46:23,374
[SPEAKER_13]: This is just one thing that's sticking in my head.

1358
01:46:23,434 --> 01:46:28,836
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a project near me, near my house, that they've been blasting ledge for years at this point.

1359
01:46:29,656 --> 01:46:32,417
[SPEAKER_13]: And we have told residents that there's nothing we can do about that.

1360
01:46:32,537 --> 01:46:41,920
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not saying that that would be a reason I would vote against this, but it is just, it's something that's rolling around the back of my head, understanding the sheer amount of ledge on the property and what we've seen happen on a property.

1361
01:46:42,861 --> 01:46:46,343
[SPEAKER_13]: in Medford that everyone refers to as the hole on Winthrop Street.

1362
01:46:46,464 --> 01:46:52,368
[SPEAKER_13]: So I would hate to see that happen again for years of blasting and quarrying, not saying that's what will happen.

1363
01:46:52,388 --> 01:46:55,931
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just saying this is a small amount of information I have to go on in addition to this.

1364
01:46:55,971 --> 01:46:58,053
[SPEAKER_13]: So I personally would just like more information.

1365
01:46:58,093 --> 01:47:01,176
[SPEAKER_13]: I feel like I'm hearing that from my fellow Councilors as well.

1366
01:47:02,508 --> 01:47:04,349
[SPEAKER_13]: So we do, Councilor Caraviello.

1367
01:47:04,950 --> 01:47:05,670
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Madam President.

1368
01:47:05,710 --> 01:47:08,031
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we've all made dollar points here.

1369
01:47:08,051 --> 01:47:10,153
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I've sat in this chair for 12 years.

1370
01:47:10,213 --> 01:47:12,014
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never done a deed restriction either.

1371
01:47:12,054 --> 01:47:18,617
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm very sympathetic to the family and I hope they get what they want or need.

1372
01:47:19,398 --> 01:47:23,380
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't know what I'm voting on.

1373
01:47:24,262 --> 01:47:34,314
[SPEAKER_05]: being honest with you, I've never done a deed restriction before, and I think the whole council needs an explanation of what the ramifications are, pro, con.

1374
01:47:36,362 --> 01:47:39,783
[SPEAKER_05]: And that said, I mean, I'm not opposed to helping the family out.

1375
01:47:40,543 --> 01:47:42,663
[SPEAKER_05]: If they need help, I'm willing to have it help them.

1376
01:47:43,324 --> 01:47:50,485
[SPEAKER_05]: I think what I'm hearing here from everybody is we've never done this before, and we just don't know what we're voting on.

1377
01:47:50,645 --> 01:48:02,248
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we had an attorney here tonight, maybe the attorney, and no disrespect to you, if we had a city solicitor here tonight, maybe it could be explained to us so we'd understand it and we wouldn't have to,

1378
01:48:03,595 --> 01:48:04,936
[SPEAKER_05]: prolong another meeting for this.

1379
01:48:05,056 --> 01:48:10,679
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's, I think, I think if I'm hearing what everybody's saying, and I think maybe you can probably sympathize with that.

1380
01:48:10,699 --> 01:48:12,300
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not trying to railroad anything.

1381
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:16,943
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm not saying you are, but I said, I don't think anyone in this room has ever done this before.

1382
01:48:17,103 --> 01:48:23,887
[SPEAKER_13]: And we do have attorney ever on the call, but I believe in correspondence with her, she's not intimately familiar with what's before us tonight.

1383
01:48:23,987 --> 01:48:27,689
[SPEAKER_13]: So she's also not our city solicitor.

1384
01:48:28,229 --> 01:48:29,830
[SPEAKER_13]: Does that cover your question?

1385
01:48:31,692 --> 01:48:32,913
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

1386
01:48:33,894 --> 01:48:34,655
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, thank you.

1387
01:48:35,396 --> 01:48:35,876
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Tseng.

1388
01:48:36,076 --> 01:48:36,977
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, President Morell.

1389
01:48:37,878 --> 01:48:40,761
[SPEAKER_19]: I would just like to echo the same sentiments as Councilor Caravielloville.

1390
01:48:40,781 --> 01:48:44,584
[SPEAKER_19]: I think this is a, you know, what I've heard is a pretty convincing project.

1391
01:48:44,644 --> 01:48:45,385
[SPEAKER_19]: I hear good stuff.

1392
01:48:45,826 --> 01:48:48,248
[SPEAKER_19]: I want your family to have what you need.

1393
01:48:48,708 --> 01:48:52,872
[SPEAKER_19]: I think there's just enough, you know, uncertainty here.

1394
01:48:52,892 --> 01:48:56,256
[SPEAKER_19]: It might be more cautious for us to learn

1395
01:48:57,136 --> 01:49:05,581
[SPEAKER_19]: to really work through the details first, but this is no way to say that we're opposed to the project, or definitely not to the spirit of the project.

1396
01:49:05,881 --> 01:49:08,242
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's just in there being cautious.

1397
01:49:09,363 --> 01:49:09,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Madam President.

1398
01:49:09,903 --> 01:49:11,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Caraviello.

1399
01:49:11,864 --> 01:49:19,828
[SPEAKER_05]: If we could maybe postpone this to a date certain, maybe to the next meeting, and we can get a legal opinion, and you can come back in two weeks.

1400
01:49:20,169 --> 01:49:20,409
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

1401
01:49:20,489 --> 01:49:24,691
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a bunch of... We have a motion for Councilor Scarpelli to approve, but we don't have a second on.

1402
01:49:25,520 --> 01:49:27,081
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you want to keep that motion Councilor Scarpelli?

1403
01:49:27,541 --> 01:49:27,721
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1404
01:49:27,901 --> 01:49:28,142
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1405
01:49:28,262 --> 01:49:30,303
[SPEAKER_13]: Do I have a second for Councilor Scarpelli's motion to approve?

1406
01:49:31,203 --> 01:49:34,205
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Scarpelli wants to approve tonight.

1407
01:49:34,645 --> 01:49:38,828
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't have language to approve though, but I know the attorney does have language he would present to us.

1408
01:49:38,848 --> 01:49:40,809
[SPEAKER_13]: So we have a motion from Councilor Scarpelli to approve.

1409
01:49:40,829 --> 01:49:41,950
[SPEAKER_13]: We're looking for a second on that.

1410
01:49:45,311 --> 01:49:46,092
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not seeing a second.

1411
01:49:47,691 --> 01:49:49,293
[SPEAKER_20]: I can't move forward.

1412
01:49:49,393 --> 01:49:51,094
[SPEAKER_13]: Then the next one in order is Councilor Collins.

1413
01:49:51,134 --> 01:49:59,442
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm happy to withdraw my motion to refer this to committee of the whole for Councilor Caraviello.

1414
01:50:00,583 --> 01:50:14,555
[SPEAKER_04]: My motion was for council for the city, the planning department and council for the petitioner to meet to discuss the proposal and see if an agreement can be reached that could be presented to the council.

1415
01:50:15,367 --> 01:50:19,371
[SPEAKER_13]: And would you like to combine that with Councilor Caraviello's table to a date certain or?

1416
01:50:22,473 --> 01:50:24,075
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess, what's your timeline?

1417
01:50:24,095 --> 01:50:28,278
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be willing to pick a date certain, but I don't want to pick a date certain that doesn't work for everybody.

1418
01:50:28,338 --> 01:50:29,459
[SPEAKER_04]: I just asked to do a bunch of work.

1419
01:50:30,120 --> 01:50:30,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Certainly.

1420
01:50:30,440 --> 01:50:35,665
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we're not looking, as I said, we're not looking to railroad anybody and not voting tonight's perfectly fine.

1421
01:50:36,398 --> 01:50:39,901
[SPEAKER_03]: That was not our intention for you to necessarily push it through tonight, although it would be nice.

1422
01:50:40,061 --> 01:50:42,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, having a date certain I think would be great.

1423
01:50:42,444 --> 01:50:44,806
[SPEAKER_03]: So at least we keep it on track and it doesn't just drift.

1424
01:50:44,846 --> 01:50:51,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we've had a lot of many months of conversation and working with various folks in the city like fire and such.

1425
01:50:52,093 --> 01:50:55,276
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just keeps kind of moving very slowly along.

1426
01:50:55,336 --> 01:50:58,579
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we finally filed something to actually get it on a calendar.

1427
01:50:58,879 --> 01:51:00,981
[SPEAKER_03]: So something happens because nothing was happening.

1428
01:51:01,598 --> 01:51:09,683
[SPEAKER_03]: So perfectly happy to meet with whomever anybody wants me to meet with and the hours to meet with perfectly happy to keep it on a calendar.

1429
01:51:09,763 --> 01:51:14,506
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that we can pick a date and whatever works for you.

1430
01:51:14,586 --> 01:51:17,908
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, we have October 3rd, 17th, 24th.

1431
01:51:18,189 --> 01:51:22,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Could we ask director Hunt and attorney Everett what their timeline?

1432
01:51:22,231 --> 01:51:27,655
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, director Hunt and attorney Everett, are you able to weigh in on what an appropriate timeline might be as far as being able to turn this around?

1433
01:51:27,675 --> 01:51:31,117
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe a couple of weeks would be sufficient.

1434
01:51:32,068 --> 01:51:37,610
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, I would like to, I was actually drafting an email to Attorney Everett.

1435
01:51:38,010 --> 01:51:39,970
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to talk about deed restrictions.

1436
01:51:40,131 --> 01:51:54,895
[SPEAKER_01]: We also need to talk about subdivision and private ways because that hasn't come up for us before a subdivision on a private way, unless it was a developer who was proposing to meet our subdivision standards.

1437
01:51:55,275 --> 01:51:57,796
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no way this meets our subdivision standards.

1438
01:51:58,316 --> 01:52:00,357
[SPEAKER_01]: So I need to get legal advice on

1439
01:52:01,317 --> 01:52:06,619
[SPEAKER_01]: what we have to can and can waive or shouldn't waive or how that works.

1440
01:52:07,559 --> 01:52:19,323
[SPEAKER_01]: I also think we have to have a meeting with the fire chief because what I heard from him when I talked to him about this casually does not seem to be the same things that Attorney Dash may have heard from him.

1441
01:52:20,323 --> 01:52:25,005
[SPEAKER_01]: So that also needs to occur before we can do this.

1442
01:52:25,625 --> 01:52:28,806
[SPEAKER_01]: We definitely, maybe we can all meet next week.

1443
01:52:29,766 --> 01:52:31,306
[SPEAKER_01]: and be back here in two weeks.

1444
01:52:31,846 --> 01:52:41,589
[SPEAKER_01]: If you continue it for two weeks, there is a chance that we would come back and say that we haven't been able to get everything together, and can you please continue it again?

1445
01:52:41,609 --> 01:52:46,070
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't a public hearing, so it's not a continuance.

1446
01:52:46,110 --> 01:52:46,950
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just tabling it.

1447
01:52:47,830 --> 01:52:49,330
[SPEAKER_01]: We would ask you to just table it again.

1448
01:52:49,350 --> 01:52:51,671
[SPEAKER_01]: We may be able to.

1449
01:52:52,774 --> 01:52:54,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Or two weeks?

1450
01:52:55,035 --> 01:52:56,656
[SPEAKER_03]: We're perfectly fine with going longer.

1451
01:52:57,196 --> 01:53:00,097
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm getting concerned that this sounds like it may take a little longer.

1452
01:53:00,397 --> 01:53:01,038
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

1453
01:53:01,498 --> 01:53:04,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that I'm looking to push it out or anything, but October 17th.

1454
01:53:04,619 --> 01:53:06,740
[SPEAKER_13]: Our third, 17th, and 24th.

1455
01:53:07,140 --> 01:53:08,221
[SPEAKER_03]: I could do the 24th.

1456
01:53:09,702 --> 01:53:11,102
[SPEAKER_13]: 24th deal?

1457
01:53:12,703 --> 01:53:13,283
[SPEAKER_13]: Looking for nods.

1458
01:53:13,303 --> 01:53:15,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds like it would work for all parties involved.

1459
01:53:15,164 --> 01:53:15,264
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

1460
01:53:16,184 --> 01:53:17,625
[SPEAKER_13]: So 24th.

1461
01:53:17,685 --> 01:53:19,906
[SPEAKER_13]: So do you have Vice President Barry's language?

1462
01:53:20,086 --> 01:53:20,206
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1463
01:53:23,376 --> 01:53:26,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want me to also include the language table to date set?

1464
01:53:26,501 --> 01:53:28,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Table to October, yeah, sure.

1465
01:53:28,365 --> 01:53:29,226
[SPEAKER_07]: Got it.

1466
01:53:29,346 --> 01:53:30,528
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you could read that back, please.

1467
01:53:31,370 --> 01:53:31,630
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1468
01:53:33,015 --> 01:53:45,366
[SPEAKER_07]: So vice president bears moved to have the planning department and legal for the city meet with legal counsel for the petitioner to meet and see if there's a solution to discuss.

1469
01:53:45,746 --> 01:53:46,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Meet to reach an agreement.

1470
01:53:46,787 --> 01:53:52,592
[SPEAKER_07]: To reach an agreement to see if an agreement can be reached and then to table this until October 24th.

1471
01:53:52,713 --> 01:53:57,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, reach an agreement to present to the council and table to the date certain of October 24th.

1472
01:54:02,755 --> 01:54:04,435
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, absolutely, this sounds perfect, thank you.

1473
01:54:04,615 --> 01:54:05,075
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1474
01:54:05,696 --> 01:54:10,656
[SPEAKER_13]: So on the motion of Vice President Bears, as amended by Councilor Caraviello, seconded by- Second.

1475
01:54:11,437 --> 01:54:14,677
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Collins, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1476
01:54:24,239 --> 01:54:24,959
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Bears.

1477
01:54:25,079 --> 01:54:25,399
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1478
01:54:25,419 --> 01:54:26,840
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Caraviello.

1479
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:27,340
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1480
01:54:27,700 --> 01:54:28,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Collins.

1481
01:54:28,460 --> 01:54:28,640
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1482
01:54:29,813 --> 01:54:31,735
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Mayne is absent because of Zoom feed.

1483
01:54:32,236 --> 01:54:32,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1484
01:54:32,997 --> 01:54:33,357
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1485
01:54:34,619 --> 01:54:35,139
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Tseng?

1486
01:54:35,199 --> 01:54:35,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1487
01:54:36,280 --> 01:54:36,921
[SPEAKER_07]: President Morell?

1488
01:54:37,121 --> 01:54:37,342
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1489
01:54:37,882 --> 01:54:40,385
[SPEAKER_13]: Five in the affirmative, one in the negative, one absent.

1490
01:54:40,405 --> 01:54:41,426
[SPEAKER_13]: The motion passes.

1491
01:54:41,526 --> 01:54:43,068
[SPEAKER_13]: We will see you all next month.

1492
01:54:43,669 --> 01:54:44,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for your consideration.

1493
01:54:44,890 --> 01:54:45,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1494
01:54:51,675 --> 01:54:55,478
[SPEAKER_13]: motions, orders and resolutions to 3-413 offered by Councilor Scarpelli.

1495
01:54:55,559 --> 01:55:04,386
[SPEAKER_13]: Be it resolved that the City Administration work with the Parks Department to perform GMAX testing on all of our turf fields across the City of Medford, specifically for concussion safety guidelines.

1496
01:55:04,426 --> 01:55:05,147
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1497
01:55:05,547 --> 01:55:06,488
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President.

1498
01:55:08,490 --> 01:55:10,031
[SPEAKER_06]: It's come to my attention that

1499
01:55:11,111 --> 01:55:13,593
[SPEAKER_06]: our turf fields are in disarray.

1500
01:55:14,374 --> 01:55:28,185
[SPEAKER_06]: And although we appreciate all the hard work going into all of these grant funded parks and playgrounds, I think our city administration has forgotten about the existing fields.

1501
01:55:29,085 --> 01:55:36,973
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is something that I've been putting on the agenda for years, hoping someone would listen.

1502
01:55:37,674 --> 01:55:43,360
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, when I'm gathering from some parents, they're a little nervous, especially what's happening in Medford High School.

1503
01:55:44,451 --> 01:55:45,793
[SPEAKER_06]: The field is a turf field.

1504
01:55:46,533 --> 01:55:52,320
[SPEAKER_06]: The field does have black pellets, but the field hasn't been tested for GMAX.

1505
01:55:52,360 --> 01:56:04,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Now what the GMAX study does is it should be tested every year, this is what we do in my profession, on a turf and natural surface fields to make sure the density is safe after a long period of time.

1506
01:56:05,775 --> 01:56:09,218
[SPEAKER_06]: The Field of Dreams was started back in early 2010.

1507
01:56:09,358 --> 01:56:30,776
[SPEAKER_06]: We're now coming on to 2024, and the life expectancy of a turf field that is maintained properly, that means to come in and groom it on a regular basis, that means on a yearly basis, coming in and doing a deep clean, that means taking the pellets up,

1508
01:56:31,933 --> 01:56:40,856
[SPEAKER_06]: re-grooming the surface and then re-entering the pellets, which, from what I gather, we haven't done on a consistent basis here in Medford.

1509
01:56:42,157 --> 01:56:57,703
[SPEAKER_06]: What was brought to my attention, the way I brought this up, is that as soon as someone says safety to me, I have to present it in a resolution so the city can get back to us in a timeline that

1510
01:56:58,890 --> 01:57:13,975
[SPEAKER_06]: God forbid somebody gets hurt and those tests weren't done, then the liability, and if the attorney's still here, this would be great because I know if the city solicitor were here, I know that that would be something very important to stress the fact that getting that test done.

1511
01:57:15,536 --> 01:57:24,599
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, what I request is the city administration to have a licensed turf

1512
01:57:26,345 --> 01:57:31,406
[SPEAKER_06]: contractor come in with a GMAC study for turf, not natural surface.

1513
01:57:31,706 --> 01:57:32,907
[SPEAKER_06]: They're two different tests.

1514
01:57:33,667 --> 01:57:48,150
[SPEAKER_06]: And they do a test at Edgley Fields behind the high school, the fields at Hormel Stadium, and from what I gather, the field at the Brooks School is absolutely deplorable.

1515
01:57:49,278 --> 01:57:54,760
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably one of the most used playgrounds in the community.

1516
01:57:55,501 --> 01:58:10,808
[SPEAKER_06]: I know our school age kids at the Brooks love that field considering what they had years ago and the mud bowl that they used to have to and then bring it into the school and it started destroying the floors at the school.

1517
01:58:11,528 --> 01:58:15,350
[SPEAKER_06]: The community really put a good effort, but they forgot again.

1518
01:58:16,315 --> 01:58:19,496
[SPEAKER_06]: an existing playground and park and Metro completely forgotten.

1519
01:58:20,517 --> 01:58:33,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless you can cut a ribbon, unless you get a big grant to do it, unless someone does something that does some work to do that stuff, we've completely forgot about our regular fields, our fields that are still existing, that our kids are on every single day.

1520
01:58:33,802 --> 01:58:33,842
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

1521
01:58:35,883 --> 01:58:40,064
[SPEAKER_06]: I would recommend, I would make the motion that we ask the city administration.

1522
01:58:41,304 --> 01:58:43,545
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if it falls under the facilities manager.

1523
01:58:44,265 --> 01:58:45,665
[SPEAKER_06]: Did we hire a facilities manager?

1524
01:58:46,645 --> 01:58:47,245
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have one.

1525
01:58:47,285 --> 01:58:55,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe that facilities manager, because at least in my role, we have a facility manager that actually oversees the parks as well as the actual buildings.

1526
01:58:56,247 --> 01:59:04,229
[SPEAKER_06]: If that falls under that person or the new, I guess there's a new director of parks that we can get a report back

1527
01:59:05,029 --> 01:59:05,989
[SPEAKER_06]: as soon as possible.

1528
01:59:06,069 --> 01:59:07,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Kids are on those fields today.

1529
01:59:08,190 --> 01:59:16,913
[SPEAKER_06]: I would hate for a kid, a young person to fall tomorrow at a game and smash their head on a on an area that hasn't been tested.

1530
01:59:17,553 --> 01:59:22,695
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we are held that first of all the safety of that that that young individual and then

1531
01:59:23,720 --> 01:59:25,220
[SPEAKER_06]: what can happen later.

1532
01:59:25,240 --> 01:59:35,224
[SPEAKER_06]: As a father of a son who saw a neurologist on a regular basis because of concussion issues, I take this very serious.

1533
01:59:37,544 --> 01:59:48,968
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the things, one of the most important pieces as we've gone through studies and now part of a working program that my son is actually involved in, that

1534
01:59:51,151 --> 02:00:07,743
[SPEAKER_06]: realizing the fields that he was playing on caused the concussions, not the head butting, not the physical bump to bump, but the actual falling on the turf as a goalie onto a turf that wasn't tested properly.

1535
02:00:08,164 --> 02:00:09,565
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that we need to,

1536
02:00:10,285 --> 02:00:17,590
[SPEAKER_06]: We, I didn't realize until parents said, you know, have you gone up to the soccer field, soccer game, that these fields are terrible.

1537
02:00:17,610 --> 02:00:23,334
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like all the pellets are washed to one side, that, you know, that they're not safe.

1538
02:00:24,354 --> 02:00:29,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, I was a proud member of that committee that built those fields in 2010.

1539
02:00:30,298 --> 02:00:36,843
[SPEAKER_06]: What we asked for is putting a fee aside, an identified fee with every renter,

1540
02:00:37,886 --> 02:00:40,890
[SPEAKER_06]: And over that 10 years, we would be able to replace that turf.

1541
02:00:40,990 --> 02:00:45,997
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, no one followed through with that control.

1542
02:00:46,157 --> 02:00:49,883
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think the city management, the administration has to

1543
02:00:51,708 --> 02:00:52,648
[SPEAKER_06]: report back to us.

1544
02:00:52,708 --> 02:00:55,369
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to, it could be done in two weeks.

1545
02:00:55,429 --> 02:00:57,150
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's important that it's done in two weeks.

1546
02:00:57,810 --> 02:01:13,654
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that they need to immediately go to all the fields, get the certified turf pro to come out to do those GeoMAX studies, and then go out to, especially from what I'm hearing at the Brooks, that the carpet now is, it's coming up on the scene.

1547
02:01:14,735 --> 02:01:18,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Now again, in my profession, a little maintenance,

1548
02:01:19,862 --> 02:01:22,123
[SPEAKER_06]: to those fields, it's simple as this.

1549
02:01:23,243 --> 02:01:35,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Vacuum in the pellets, adding liquid nail down, patting it back down, and then putting a weight on top of it for 24 hours, and we don't have those dangerous issues anymore.

1550
02:01:35,567 --> 02:01:39,169
[SPEAKER_06]: And then re-entering the pellets.

1551
02:01:40,669 --> 02:01:42,610
[SPEAKER_06]: It's simple, but no one's doing it.

1552
02:01:43,757 --> 02:01:54,727
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think we need, you know, I'd like to get a report back in two weeks if the clerk can make that as part of the motion, because it's brought to my attention.

1553
02:01:54,767 --> 02:01:57,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that it's brought to my attention, I think that we have to move on this quickly.

1554
02:01:58,030 --> 02:02:05,037
[SPEAKER_06]: And believe me, I would hate, I would hate to see what happens if they have to close those fields.

1555
02:02:05,995 --> 02:02:15,741
[SPEAKER_06]: because we didn't do the preventative maintenance that we typically haven't done in our facilities so far.

1556
02:02:15,861 --> 02:02:17,983
[SPEAKER_06]: So I hope that answers that.

1557
02:02:18,003 --> 02:02:24,267
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope that you understand that, Mr. Clerk, and thank you, Madam President.

1558
02:02:24,287 --> 02:02:25,167
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1559
02:02:26,208 --> 02:02:27,369
[SPEAKER_13]: Any further discussion on the council?

1560
02:02:28,809 --> 02:02:29,430
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice Mayor Bears.

1561
02:02:30,038 --> 02:02:30,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Madam President.

1562
02:02:30,698 --> 02:02:32,540
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank Councilor Scarpelli for bringing this forward.

1563
02:02:32,580 --> 02:02:38,324
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we discussed it the other week as well, and I've heard similar concerns from folks.

1564
02:02:38,384 --> 02:02:40,485
[SPEAKER_04]: So I really hope this gets addressed quickly.

1565
02:02:41,466 --> 02:02:46,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Through the chair to Councilor Scarpelli, I don't know if, sorry if I just may just spill your water.

1566
02:02:49,968 --> 02:02:57,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Given what you were saying, has there been a shift away, and given your expertise in this, has there been a shift away from turf back towards grass?

1567
02:02:58,173 --> 02:03:04,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, especially in Somerville, because of the growth, and we're seeing that in Medford,

1568
02:03:05,817 --> 02:03:09,358
[SPEAKER_06]: natural surface fields have to have a resting period.

1569
02:03:10,078 --> 02:03:16,799
[SPEAKER_06]: So to maintain, thank you, to maintain a natural surface field in the East Coast right now, it's impossible.

1570
02:03:18,400 --> 02:03:25,681
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless you're an affluent community that has the ability to have six natural surface fields and rotate those fields.

1571
02:03:26,501 --> 02:03:33,423
[SPEAKER_06]: But I will tell you, I was directly involved, again, because of my son, the biggest concerns are

1572
02:03:33,983 --> 02:03:37,145
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, the toxins that are in the pellets.

1573
02:03:37,746 --> 02:03:46,271
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've done, we've had some major strides with looking at more environmentally safe products.

1574
02:03:46,812 --> 02:03:51,595
[SPEAKER_06]: We tried coconut husks, then we realized we had kids that were allergic to coconut husks.

1575
02:03:52,075 --> 02:03:56,639
[SPEAKER_06]: So what we've done in Somerville is now we use a soft wood pellet

1576
02:03:57,439 --> 02:04:03,361
[SPEAKER_06]: that has to be maintained on a daily basis because when it rains or wind blows, it pushes the pellets.

1577
02:04:03,481 --> 02:04:06,562
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's safer for the environment.

1578
02:04:07,362 --> 02:04:11,443
[SPEAKER_06]: It's needed because we don't have many fields in our community that I work in.

1579
02:04:12,104 --> 02:04:23,327
[SPEAKER_06]: And believe us, I think we, I personally, I agree for a son that played Division One soccer and played soccer his whole life, I understand having natural surface fields.

1580
02:04:24,402 --> 02:04:42,040
[SPEAKER_06]: what we all want but unfortunately in the east coast especially and being a city like Medford that's community like metric it's very difficult to maintain all of the youth activities and sports and um and do that i know that you know we've been very fortunate that you know that um

1581
02:04:43,050 --> 02:04:51,015
[SPEAKER_06]: We've had an athletic director that he's always been on the forefront of making sure that these tests are done.

1582
02:04:51,035 --> 02:05:01,882
[SPEAKER_06]: And I appreciate that, but it's the trend that we're seeing, not just at the high school, we're seeing it all over the city and having the tools and understanding.

1583
02:05:02,523 --> 02:05:07,926
[SPEAKER_06]: And back in the day, there was always, I don't even know if the battle is over, who has the high school?

1584
02:05:08,466 --> 02:05:10,548
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it the city or is it the schools?

1585
02:05:11,690 --> 02:05:16,554
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know if that's ever been, been, you know, delineated yet.

1586
02:05:16,674 --> 02:05:22,038
[SPEAKER_06]: So, but again, like Councilor Bears, I know I could talk or buzz it off a meat wagon, but yeah, I wish we could.

1587
02:05:22,398 --> 02:05:23,819
[SPEAKER_06]: My preference is a grass field.

1588
02:05:24,119 --> 02:05:30,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, it's very difficult to have a grass field and use it the hours.

1589
02:05:30,344 --> 02:05:34,967
[SPEAKER_06]: We have one grass field in Somerville and we kept it at the Argenziano School.

1590
02:05:35,648 --> 02:05:40,852
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're ecstatic that we kept the grass field and we've had to condemn it because

1591
02:05:42,144 --> 02:05:46,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, the dogs, um, dig up holes now.

1592
02:05:46,947 --> 02:05:52,451
[SPEAKER_06]: So now there are so many, they call landmines, park landmines all over the city, all over the field.

1593
02:05:52,891 --> 02:05:55,273
[SPEAKER_06]: We had to close that field down and, um,

1594
02:05:56,561 --> 02:05:58,963
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, it's not, you know, like I said, we want it.

1595
02:05:59,163 --> 02:05:59,844
[SPEAKER_06]: We really do.

1596
02:05:59,904 --> 02:06:02,907
[SPEAKER_06]: We want one natural surface fields, but it's very difficult.

1597
02:06:03,547 --> 02:06:04,028
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate it.

1598
02:06:04,048 --> 02:06:04,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for that.

1599
02:06:05,889 --> 02:06:07,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you madam chair.

1600
02:06:07,190 --> 02:06:07,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1601
02:06:07,871 --> 02:06:08,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1602
02:06:08,952 --> 02:06:13,596
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, part of my reason was I saw Leo Messi said he wouldn't play at a field.

1603
02:06:13,676 --> 02:06:13,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?

1604
02:06:14,056 --> 02:06:14,637
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.

1605
02:06:16,045 --> 02:06:17,426
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of those are made out of gnarly stuff.

1606
02:06:17,746 --> 02:06:18,687
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1607
02:06:19,288 --> 02:06:19,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1608
02:06:19,748 --> 02:06:26,554
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you want to combine, because I think you kind of went into the Brooksville one, or do you want to keep the next motion resolution separate?

1609
02:06:26,994 --> 02:06:28,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we can combine them if we want.

1610
02:06:33,330 --> 02:06:37,391
[SPEAKER_05]: I thank Councilor Caput for putting on that second one here because I live in that neighborhood.

1611
02:06:38,871 --> 02:06:46,733
[SPEAKER_06]: If I can't, if I, I'm sorry, Councilor, I just, I don't wanna, I just got information that the field was tested and they do it two times a year.

1612
02:06:46,753 --> 02:06:47,413
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's good news.

1613
02:06:47,493 --> 02:06:56,294
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's great news that I appreciate the information that the information that I received was wrong and I don't wanna spread misinformation.

1614
02:06:56,334 --> 02:06:58,955
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's great news and we appreciate that.

1615
02:06:59,716 --> 02:06:59,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1616
02:06:59,936 --> 02:07:00,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1617
02:07:00,276 --> 02:07:00,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President.

1618
02:07:01,417 --> 02:07:08,265
[SPEAKER_05]: And I live in that neighborhood, and if I'm not mistaken, I think that field was paid for by the Brooks PTO.

1619
02:07:08,285 --> 02:07:11,649
[SPEAKER_05]: They raised a lot of money to cover up that dirt field.

1620
02:07:11,949 --> 02:07:12,590
[SPEAKER_05]: They drafted it.

1621
02:07:12,650 --> 02:07:13,371
[SPEAKER_05]: It didn't go good.

1622
02:07:13,831 --> 02:07:17,876
[SPEAKER_05]: And thanks to the parents over there, they got the field.

1623
02:07:19,302 --> 02:07:26,864
[SPEAKER_05]: I see the kids all the time, but at night and on the weekends, there's adults playing there.

1624
02:07:27,505 --> 02:07:31,426
[SPEAKER_05]: That camp wasn't made for that, and they're not Medford residents playing there.

1625
02:07:32,146 --> 02:07:37,448
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, it's a shame that that field has gotten that kind of abuse, and it's ripping.

1626
02:07:37,488 --> 02:07:41,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you said, I see it, it's ripping, and I don't know how to fix that.

1627
02:07:41,753 --> 02:07:44,054
[SPEAKER_06]: Point of information, again, that poses another question.

1628
02:07:45,115 --> 02:07:51,518
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it the PACS department that rents those fields, or is it the Brooks School that?

1629
02:07:52,658 --> 02:07:54,099
[SPEAKER_06]: But we should police that better.

1630
02:07:54,940 --> 02:08:01,063
[SPEAKER_06]: We have two fields in our community that I work in that are only used for U-12 and under.

1631
02:08:01,823 --> 02:08:26,168
[SPEAKER_06]: no adults can be on those fields and SPD know that if anybody's on there or the neighbors know they call recreation we send somebody down and we send PD down they just right from the car say please get off the field you have the permit and and that's probably the reason why it is this yeah and I say I you know I've gone there before and said that and I was I won't tell you what was said to me but um if you know that what

1632
02:08:26,847 --> 02:08:29,148
[SPEAKER_05]: That turf wasn't made for adults to be playing on.

1633
02:08:29,649 --> 02:08:41,436
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're a nuisance to the neighbors because they're there at eight, nine o'clock at night still playing when the neighbors aren't, you know, weren't planning on putting a soccer field next to the house.

1634
02:08:41,596 --> 02:08:44,258
[SPEAKER_05]: So I thank the council for that, but okay.

1635
02:08:45,279 --> 02:08:48,881
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a shame that that field is getting ruined and the parents put a lot of work into that.

1636
02:08:49,862 --> 02:08:50,602
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

1637
02:08:51,322 --> 02:08:55,125
[SPEAKER_13]: So on the motion of a Councilor Scarapelli to join the papers and

1638
02:08:55,962 --> 02:08:57,003
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you have a specific language?

1639
02:09:35,855 --> 02:09:39,236
[SPEAKER_07]: So just to clarify, you want to join the two papers, but you want to withdraw the amendment.

1640
02:09:40,757 --> 02:09:42,757
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1641
02:09:43,478 --> 02:09:56,822
[SPEAKER_13]: So we'll draw 23-413 and then on 23414 motion to request the parks department repair any and all turf issues at the Brooks School mini soccer field.

1642
02:09:57,402 --> 02:09:59,823
[SPEAKER_13]: Seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

1643
02:09:59,943 --> 02:10:00,583
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

1644
02:10:00,603 --> 02:10:01,964
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

1645
02:10:02,024 --> 02:10:02,604
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

1646
02:10:06,676 --> 02:10:18,921
[SPEAKER_13]: 23-415 offered by, just don't call it like eight or nine, gonna get him all mad.

1647
02:10:18,941 --> 02:10:25,523
[SPEAKER_13]: 23-415 offered by Councilor Caraviello, be it resolved that Medford City Council discuss the overnight and daytime commercial parking issues within the city of Medford.

1648
02:10:25,563 --> 02:10:26,283
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Caraviello.

1649
02:10:26,704 --> 02:10:27,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Madam President.

1650
02:10:27,724 --> 02:10:31,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Madam President, this has been a very sore subject to me for many years.

1651
02:10:33,072 --> 02:10:35,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Two weeks ago, I drove down Commercial Street.

1652
02:10:36,534 --> 02:10:39,616
[SPEAKER_05]: There were 17 tractor trailers parked there.

1653
02:10:40,517 --> 02:10:43,439
[SPEAKER_05]: We are becoming a truck stop in the area.

1654
02:10:44,420 --> 02:10:53,966
[SPEAKER_05]: You see Commercial Street, you see next to the Old Century Bank, trucks there, and back at the City Yard, there's trucks there.

1655
02:10:54,987 --> 02:11:00,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Going back to Stop and Shop parking lot, there's people living there now in motorhomes.

1656
02:11:03,197 --> 02:11:09,726
[SPEAKER_05]: Trucks parked all over that parking lot, and I don't even think the owners of the property even know what's going on.

1657
02:11:12,469 --> 02:11:17,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Go to Ring Road, there's six taxis parked there all day and night now.

1658
02:11:18,583 --> 02:11:22,046
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a parking garage for all these commercial businesses.

1659
02:11:22,546 --> 02:11:26,309
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not what our parking enforcement is supposed to be.

1660
02:11:26,469 --> 02:11:27,991
[SPEAKER_05]: They should be policing this.

1661
02:11:28,851 --> 02:11:31,613
[SPEAKER_05]: We have an ordinance about no overnight parking.

1662
02:11:32,394 --> 02:11:41,842
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, listen, I understand that the carpenter who parks his truck on the street and his neighbor, you want to give him a little bit of break, but these are people

1663
02:11:43,230 --> 02:11:48,293
[SPEAKER_05]: There's seven trucks from Everett that park on Commercial Street, and not counting the car carriers and everything.

1664
02:11:48,313 --> 02:11:48,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1665
02:11:51,594 --> 02:11:58,298
[SPEAKER_05]: We won't even go into the VFW parking lot, which is another truck spot.

1666
02:12:00,119 --> 02:12:01,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's our parking department?

1667
02:12:02,180 --> 02:12:03,200
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's our parking department?

1668
02:12:03,440 --> 02:12:04,041
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't noticed.

1669
02:12:04,101 --> 02:12:08,543
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, do they not work at night?

1670
02:12:08,583 --> 02:12:10,524
[SPEAKER_05]: That's been a giant concern of mine forever.

1671
02:12:10,824 --> 02:12:12,865
[SPEAKER_05]: And while we're talking about parking,

1672
02:12:14,818 --> 02:12:18,541
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a call the other day from St.

1673
02:12:18,561 --> 02:12:19,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Mary's Road.

1674
02:12:20,702 --> 02:12:21,723
[SPEAKER_05]: It's permit parking.

1675
02:12:22,523 --> 02:12:24,084
[SPEAKER_05]: And all the people from the condo at St.

1676
02:12:24,124 --> 02:12:25,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Francis are parking there.

1677
02:12:26,306 --> 02:12:27,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's our parking departments?

1678
02:12:28,027 --> 02:12:28,667
[SPEAKER_05]: What are they doing?

1679
02:12:29,608 --> 02:12:30,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Do they work at night?

1680
02:12:30,369 --> 02:12:31,149
[SPEAKER_05]: Do they not work at night?

1681
02:12:31,169 --> 02:12:32,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Do they not work during the day?

1682
02:12:35,681 --> 02:12:42,186
[SPEAKER_05]: I've reached out to Chief Buckley on this truck thing, and I kind of didn't really get a response from him.

1683
02:12:42,826 --> 02:12:52,433
[SPEAKER_05]: But I want to know what is the rule for our parking department to enforce these tractor trailers from not coming here anymore.

1684
02:12:53,173 --> 02:12:54,854
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the rub on our city.

1685
02:12:55,135 --> 02:12:56,335
[SPEAKER_05]: We look like crap.

1686
02:12:57,516 --> 02:13:00,078
[SPEAKER_05]: These go back to everywhere you belong.

1687
02:13:00,358 --> 02:13:02,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Go back to the cities where a truck stopped.

1688
02:13:03,755 --> 02:13:04,615
[SPEAKER_05]: off the highway now.

1689
02:13:07,896 --> 02:13:10,257
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the curb appeal to see, this is what people see.

1690
02:13:10,277 --> 02:13:11,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1691
02:13:11,838 --> 02:13:13,518
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

1692
02:13:13,598 --> 02:13:23,201
[SPEAKER_13]: I do wanna know, I actually did get a note from Director Morrison that the parking department is having their second community meeting on Wednesday, October 18th at six at the Medford Senior Center.

1693
02:13:24,042 --> 02:13:25,042
[SPEAKER_04]: So Vice Mayor Ferris.

1694
02:13:25,062 --> 02:13:28,283
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanna clarify that we're specifically talking about the trucks going back to Everett.

1695
02:13:28,303 --> 02:13:28,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1696
02:13:29,303 --> 02:13:30,104
[SPEAKER_04]: And secondly,

1697
02:13:31,899 --> 02:13:34,961
[SPEAKER_04]: do we know the, do we know you were talking about commercial street, right?

1698
02:13:35,301 --> 02:13:38,503
[SPEAKER_04]: The seven, the 17 tractors, right.

1699
02:13:38,523 --> 02:13:42,286
[SPEAKER_04]: But the 17 tractors were on commercial street on the city, on the city.

1700
02:13:43,367 --> 02:13:44,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there any signage?

1701
02:13:44,327 --> 02:13:44,848
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I guess.

1702
02:13:44,868 --> 02:13:50,251
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I saw that.

1703
02:13:50,271 --> 02:13:54,774
[SPEAKER_04]: I will.

1704
02:13:54,794 --> 02:13:55,655
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I've seen the trucks.

1705
02:13:55,935 --> 02:13:58,937
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I'm just wondering if we could do a B paper here that

1706
02:14:02,198 --> 02:14:20,590
[SPEAKER_04]: We submit to the traffic commission that they put in, you know, essentially that that through the clerk that the council submits a petition to Alva Erickson to put on the traffic commission agenda to make it no parking no standing on commercial street between midnight and 6am or, you know, I mean I'm not I don't the hours I don't really care but

1707
02:14:21,960 --> 02:14:22,881
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll do respect Councilor.

1708
02:14:23,141 --> 02:14:25,905
[SPEAKER_05]: It is just commercial Street on Fulbright.

1709
02:14:26,265 --> 02:14:30,131
[SPEAKER_05]: There's three car carriers the park on Fulbright Yeah, and I asked the guy so what do you pocket?

1710
02:14:30,171 --> 02:14:33,736
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just all he says they told me I could park here because parking's a lot

1711
02:14:34,975 --> 02:14:39,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I guess then it would be, I mean, we can name the list of streets now, but.

1712
02:14:40,259 --> 02:14:49,346
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's say, going back to the city, you'll probably see two tractor trailers there and all that, and I talked to the chief about that, and he's telling me it's state property, nothing he can do about it.

1713
02:14:49,786 --> 02:14:54,710
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're passing the buck all around, but I say, we're a truck stop.

1714
02:14:55,010 --> 02:14:56,071
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the ugly of the city.

1715
02:14:57,012 --> 02:14:59,634
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll follow up with you after the meeting about something, thanks.

1716
02:15:01,063 --> 02:15:02,023
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you want to do that beat paper?

1717
02:15:02,564 --> 02:15:02,824
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1718
02:15:03,304 --> 02:15:07,205
[SPEAKER_13]: So on the motion of Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Collins.

1719
02:15:07,225 --> 02:15:07,885
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

1720
02:15:08,566 --> 02:15:09,346
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

1721
02:15:09,446 --> 02:15:11,567
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

1722
02:15:11,587 --> 02:15:17,909
[SPEAKER_13]: 23-416 offered by Councilor Scarpelli, be it resolved that the health department meet with the city council to discuss voting concerns happening all over the city of Medford.

1723
02:15:18,629 --> 02:15:21,270
[SPEAKER_13]: I do, I don't want to cut you off.

1724
02:15:21,870 --> 02:15:24,431
[SPEAKER_13]: I did reach out to Mary, Director O'Connor,

1725
02:15:24,931 --> 02:15:26,633
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a meeting scheduled for October 3rd.

1726
02:15:26,693 --> 02:15:27,674
[SPEAKER_13]: I asked if she could be here tonight.

1727
02:15:27,694 --> 02:15:38,144
[SPEAKER_13]: She couldn't be here tonight, but she did say she's actually meeting with DPW and code enforcement this week to make a better plan or understand what they can do to better what's not being done right now to better address the problem.

1728
02:15:38,185 --> 02:15:40,287
[SPEAKER_13]: So October 3rd, we have a committee of the whole scheduled with her.

1729
02:15:40,347 --> 02:15:40,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.

1730
02:15:40,827 --> 02:15:41,248
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll go to you.

1731
02:15:42,036 --> 02:15:42,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President.

1732
02:15:42,797 --> 02:15:51,992
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that I appreciate your hard work because I know that that's the reason why I brought it up again, because it seems to fade and it's not fading.

1733
02:15:52,052 --> 02:15:54,756
[SPEAKER_06]: It's getting worse with the rats and the rodents.

1734
02:15:54,836 --> 02:15:56,218
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that, um,

1735
02:15:57,101 --> 02:16:03,266
[SPEAKER_06]: It's now creeping into parts of the community that you wouldn't typically see rodent infestation.

1736
02:16:03,306 --> 02:16:12,213
[SPEAKER_06]: You're seeing them, you know, typically saw them around the sewer systems, but now you're seeing them in the ledge areas in different parts of the community.

1737
02:16:12,293 --> 02:16:13,514
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's, um,

1738
02:16:14,734 --> 02:16:26,476
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to really have the voice of our public health, our city DPW director, and really sit down and share with the community.

1739
02:16:26,516 --> 02:16:39,879
[SPEAKER_06]: I know we've made some changes that we asked for our health department to want private property if you see a nest or colony or whatever they call it now, but people don't know that.

1740
02:16:41,341 --> 02:16:48,588
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a neighbor call me and they said they can't do this because it's on my neighbor's property.

1741
02:16:48,628 --> 02:17:01,679
[SPEAKER_06]: And I said, no, we now have made some changes that we just have to get permission and we could stop those nests that are maybe on your neighbor's property, but they're coming into

1742
02:17:03,221 --> 02:17:07,183
[SPEAKER_06]: I was, a neighbor sent a video from a home at Felsway.

1743
02:17:07,423 --> 02:17:13,086
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I tell you, I thought he got it from, I thought it was a video from a movie.

1744
02:17:13,406 --> 02:17:20,190
[SPEAKER_06]: And he had a train of rats walking down his garden wall.

1745
02:17:20,910 --> 02:17:25,513
[SPEAKER_06]: And he showed, they went right into a hole.

1746
02:17:25,993 --> 02:17:28,815
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was, to me, it's just, we need to,

1747
02:17:30,450 --> 02:17:40,993
[SPEAKER_06]: something that I know that can't be fixed in one day but we need a plan that involves every corner of this community because it's coming from everywhere you know you're not

1748
02:17:42,010 --> 02:17:49,435
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you're seeing it in West Medford, you're seeing it in Wellington, you're seeing it in North Medford, you're seeing it in South Medford, you know, you're seeing it in the Heights now.

1749
02:17:49,595 --> 02:17:52,957
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you know, when you see it in God's country, that's a problem.

1750
02:17:53,477 --> 02:18:01,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Councilor Scarpelli, I don't wanna, this is not good advice, I think, for anyone, but if you live as close to the highway as I do, even the rats don't wanna be there.

1751
02:18:02,143 --> 02:18:04,364
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the one solution, I think.

1752
02:18:05,325 --> 02:18:06,606
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a great selling point.

1753
02:18:07,286 --> 02:18:09,307
[SPEAKER_06]: But thank you, Madam Mayor.

1754
02:18:09,327 --> 02:18:11,407
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Madam President and Madam Mayor.

1755
02:18:11,807 --> 02:18:12,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Madam President.

1756
02:18:13,268 --> 02:18:23,970
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we're digging up the field on Fulton Street, and now we're getting the calls from Englehardt Early and all those streets, because the rats are coming over there.

1757
02:18:24,691 --> 02:18:28,132
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, we're part of the blame, too.

1758
02:18:28,912 --> 02:18:33,193
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, not on purpose, but more and more people have gardens now.

1759
02:18:34,228 --> 02:18:40,275
[SPEAKER_05]: that probably never had them before, because the rats go, they're eating the vegetables, the fruit, because I see them.

1760
02:18:40,916 --> 02:18:49,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Bird feeders, I mean, that's, I say, I think we all got to share a little bit of the blame here on where it comes, but the,

1761
02:18:53,803 --> 02:18:56,204
[SPEAKER_05]: the parks and the big areas where we're going to.

1762
02:18:56,224 --> 02:19:07,850
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if we're holding ourselves as a city to the same standards that we're holding developers to for the road and control.

1763
02:19:08,270 --> 02:19:10,731
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's to say, it's just a problem.

1764
02:19:11,811 --> 02:19:15,753
[SPEAKER_05]: No matter where you go, I don't think any area of the city is immune anymore.

1765
02:19:17,034 --> 02:19:17,354
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1766
02:19:21,056 --> 02:19:22,616
[SPEAKER_15]: We're here to see 2 North Street.

1767
02:19:24,600 --> 02:19:27,981
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a couple of issues, but I'll talk about the rodent issue right now.

1768
02:19:28,141 --> 02:19:35,284
[SPEAKER_15]: When I was out collecting the signatures on the petition for the Walkman Court, I started mid-June to the end of August.

1769
02:19:37,284 --> 02:19:41,486
[SPEAKER_15]: I've seen three rats.

1770
02:19:41,846 --> 02:19:49,889
[SPEAKER_15]: One day I was on Pinkham Road, Hillside, rang a doorbell, looked across the street, was a rat crossing the driveway of the house across the street.

1771
02:19:51,029 --> 02:19:52,670
[SPEAKER_15]: Another night we had gone to the,

1772
02:19:55,029 --> 02:19:59,971
[SPEAKER_15]: walk-in court meeting that the housing authority had, and I was coming home at dusk.

1773
02:20:00,792 --> 02:20:03,153
[SPEAKER_15]: I think this was the April meeting, the end of April.

1774
02:20:04,133 --> 02:20:11,237
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was talking to some of my neighbors outside, and a big rat comes along the gutter across the street, down North Street.

1775
02:20:12,738 --> 02:20:21,542
[SPEAKER_15]: Another day, I was down at the end of Marshall Street, where Marshall Street meets Winthrop Street, and there was a guy who had, he was on his porch, and he had a dumpster outside his house.

1776
02:20:22,282 --> 02:20:23,863
[SPEAKER_15]: And I said, what's the dumpster for?

1777
02:20:24,267 --> 02:20:26,389
[SPEAKER_15]: He says, I've got rats in my basement.

1778
02:20:26,449 --> 02:20:35,637
[SPEAKER_15]: He says, I have to throw everything out of my basement because I got to get a cement guy come to patch up the inside of the cement on the foundation so the rats can't get in.

1779
02:20:36,577 --> 02:20:48,548
[SPEAKER_15]: So I don't know if it's got anything to do with the Clarendon Hill project that they're working on up there, the disturbance that have sent the rats down to the hillside, but that's a possibility.

1780
02:20:48,608 --> 02:20:51,570
[SPEAKER_15]: But I don't think it's the- Some of the rats.

1781
02:20:53,912 --> 02:20:56,254
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think this has got anything to do with gardens.

1782
02:20:56,394 --> 02:21:04,121
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's got to do, because I saw them like in the, before the gardens, you know, the produce grew.

1783
02:21:05,101 --> 02:21:07,744
[SPEAKER_15]: So there is a definite change.

1784
02:21:08,264 --> 02:21:11,187
[SPEAKER_15]: Back this week, I've never had a mouse or rat in my house.

1785
02:21:11,347 --> 02:21:12,368
[SPEAKER_15]: I had a mouse this week.

1786
02:21:12,968 --> 02:21:14,710
[SPEAKER_15]: So it gets personal now.

1787
02:21:17,802 --> 02:21:21,144
[SPEAKER_15]: It's only a mouse, it's not a rat, but it's a personal mouse.

1788
02:21:21,725 --> 02:21:24,146
[SPEAKER_15]: So anyway, all right, that's this issue.

1789
02:21:24,186 --> 02:21:26,567
[SPEAKER_15]: When you're through, I have some other things I'd like to talk to you about.

1790
02:21:28,289 --> 02:21:28,489
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1791
02:21:28,509 --> 02:21:34,853
[SPEAKER_13]: Any further discussion on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by- Second.

1792
02:21:34,893 --> 02:21:38,695
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Caraviellola, all those in favor?

1793
02:21:38,815 --> 02:21:38,895
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

1794
02:21:38,995 --> 02:21:40,356
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

1795
02:21:40,416 --> 02:21:41,577
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to assemble, yes.

1796
02:21:50,965 --> 02:21:55,567
[SPEAKER_13]: seconded by vice president bears.

1797
02:21:55,587 --> 02:22:02,111
[SPEAKER_13]: 23 23-023 offered by vice president bears in an ordinance amending Chapter 10 of the revised ordinance of the city of Medford, Madam President.

1798
02:22:02,391 --> 02:22:05,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Question bears motion with the reading in favor of a short summary.

1799
02:22:05,672 --> 02:22:08,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Um I can do very quickly and then I'll turn it over to director Hunt.

1800
02:22:08,254 --> 02:22:10,755
[SPEAKER_13]: If she's still on the line, she is on the motion.

1801
02:22:10,775 --> 02:22:11,575
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice is embarrassed to

1802
02:22:17,284 --> 02:22:19,485
[SPEAKER_13]: I suppose motion passes.

1803
02:22:20,106 --> 02:22:20,286
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1804
02:22:20,646 --> 02:22:33,472
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to have to, um, if this is, uh, to speak on any changes to solar in, uh, as part of the discussion, um, I'd have to separate myself.

1805
02:22:33,673 --> 02:22:35,974
[SPEAKER_06]: I do now own a solar company.

1806
02:22:36,894 --> 02:22:38,755
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, so I'd have to step away.

1807
02:22:39,335 --> 02:22:39,956
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, everyone.

1808
02:22:40,036 --> 02:22:40,536
[SPEAKER_06]: It's real.

1809
02:22:41,136 --> 02:22:43,918
[SPEAKER_06]: George Scarpelli does care about the environment, but

1810
02:22:44,729 --> 02:22:47,351
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I'm going to separate myself from this.

1811
02:22:48,611 --> 02:22:48,952
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1812
02:22:48,972 --> 02:22:49,572
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1813
02:22:51,653 --> 02:22:52,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Madam President.

1814
02:22:52,814 --> 02:22:57,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it does does mention solar in there.

1815
02:22:57,096 --> 02:23:03,080
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, it was surprised to me to hear that my fellow Councilor had joined the entrepreneurial world.

1816
02:23:03,100 --> 02:23:03,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Um,

1817
02:23:06,324 --> 02:23:24,830
[SPEAKER_04]: In any case, in January, this council passed a paper requesting that the city administration, specifically the planning development sustainability office, provide us with an ordinance to adopt the specialized energy code, which is part of the climate bill that passed the state house recently.

1818
02:23:25,690 --> 02:23:26,330
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll leave it there.

1819
02:23:26,390 --> 02:23:33,973
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to say I'm really thankful to our climate planner, Brenda, and to Alicia Hunt and her office for getting this to us.

1820
02:23:34,973 --> 02:23:39,074
[SPEAKER_04]: for the mayor's office and KP Law team for reviewing this.

1821
02:23:39,194 --> 02:23:55,098
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is good, and this is something that we've all been pushing forward to adopt to make sure that new construction in our city is based on the latest of the state's building codes and is doing as much as it possibly can to get us to our climate goals.

1822
02:23:55,238 --> 02:24:00,459
[SPEAKER_04]: So I will stop there to hear from our Planning and Development Sustainability Director, Alicia Hunt.

1823
02:24:00,599 --> 02:24:00,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1824
02:24:01,699 --> 02:24:02,040
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1825
02:24:02,600 --> 02:24:03,640
[SPEAKER_13]: Going to Director Hunt.

1826
02:24:06,612 --> 02:24:08,514
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening, Madam President.

1827
02:24:08,734 --> 02:24:09,555
[SPEAKER_01]: My apologies.

1828
02:24:10,656 --> 02:24:14,720
[SPEAKER_01]: I had been expecting our climate planner, Brenda Pike, to speak on this.

1829
02:24:16,262 --> 02:24:18,564
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just checking if she was still, she's available.

1830
02:24:18,644 --> 02:24:22,668
[SPEAKER_01]: She doesn't have her camera on, but she's available to speak to this.

1831
02:24:22,688 --> 02:24:25,471
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an area that she is quite knowledgeable on.

1832
02:24:27,733 --> 02:24:28,474
[SPEAKER_01]: Ask her to unmute.

1833
02:24:31,661 --> 02:24:33,542
[SPEAKER_16]: Brenda, welcome.

1834
02:24:33,742 --> 02:24:34,083
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi.

1835
02:24:34,583 --> 02:24:49,872
[SPEAKER_16]: So I would just do a quick summary of this in saying that the city of Medford has already adopted the stretch energy code back in 2010.

1836
02:24:51,193 --> 02:24:53,915
[SPEAKER_16]: And so what we are talking about here is just

1837
02:24:55,656 --> 02:25:21,555
[SPEAKER_16]: Expanding that from the Stretch Energy Code to the Specialized Energy Code, I would say the biggest change there is the requirement for multifamily properties over a certain size to meet passive house standards over 4,000 square feet.

1838
02:25:24,077 --> 02:25:24,337
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1839
02:25:25,630 --> 02:25:26,753
[SPEAKER_13]: Any questions from the council?

1840
02:25:30,582 --> 02:25:31,905
[SPEAKER_13]: Any members of the public wish to speak?

1841
02:25:36,005 --> 02:25:36,465
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Tseng?

1842
02:25:36,485 --> 02:25:37,806
[SPEAKER_19]: I have a general comment.

1843
02:25:37,926 --> 02:25:44,330
[SPEAKER_19]: I just wanted to thank the Planning, Development and Sustainability Office and our Climate Planner for working on this.

1844
02:25:45,411 --> 02:25:51,975
[SPEAKER_19]: This was a real priority of the Council back in January when Councilor Bears, when Vice President Bears introduced this.

1845
02:25:53,016 --> 02:25:57,279
[SPEAKER_19]: This is something I think that at the time we were really gung-ho that he introduced this.

1846
02:25:58,059 --> 02:26:03,503
[SPEAKER_19]: And I wanted to thank your office for getting back to us with this.

1847
02:26:03,783 --> 02:26:04,944
[SPEAKER_19]: I wanted to thank everyone

1848
02:26:05,144 --> 02:26:06,925
[SPEAKER_19]: for cooperating with the city council on this.

1849
02:26:08,066 --> 02:26:08,826
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

1850
02:26:10,327 --> 02:26:11,228
[SPEAKER_13]: Do I have a motion?

1851
02:26:12,669 --> 02:26:13,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to approve for first reading.

1852
02:26:14,950 --> 02:26:19,113
[SPEAKER_13]: The motion from Vice President Bears to approve for first reading, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

1853
02:26:19,133 --> 02:26:20,233
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1854
02:26:32,201 --> 02:26:32,961
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Bears.

1855
02:26:33,021 --> 02:26:33,262
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1856
02:26:34,572 --> 02:26:35,193
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Caraviello?

1857
02:26:35,293 --> 02:26:35,533
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1858
02:26:35,593 --> 02:26:36,854
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Collins?

1859
02:26:36,974 --> 02:26:37,235
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1860
02:26:37,255 --> 02:26:38,957
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Caraviello is absent.

1861
02:26:39,337 --> 02:26:41,079
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Strudel is accused.

1862
02:26:43,381 --> 02:26:43,681
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1863
02:26:44,602 --> 02:26:45,223
[SPEAKER_08]: President Morocco?

1864
02:26:45,563 --> 02:26:45,804
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1865
02:26:46,444 --> 02:26:50,108
[SPEAKER_13]: Five in the affirmative, zero in the negative, one absent, and one accused.

1866
02:26:50,268 --> 02:26:52,471
[SPEAKER_13]: The motion passes for first reading.

1867
02:26:53,892 --> 02:26:54,733
[SPEAKER_13]: Going to 23.418.

1868
02:26:58,187 --> 02:27:03,049
[SPEAKER_13]: to Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council regarding proposed ARPA project in excess of $250,000.

1869
02:27:03,269 --> 02:27:16,514
[SPEAKER_13]: Dear President Morell and members of the City Council, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body allow time for the presentation by Planning Development Sustainability Director, Alicia Hunt on the following ARPA project, which was presented originally for 750,000 in December of 2022.

1870
02:27:16,554 --> 02:27:18,115
[SPEAKER_13]: School of McGlynn Playground Project, originally $750,000, now $1,015,000.

1871
02:27:18,155 --> 02:27:20,716
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

1872
02:27:26,951 --> 02:27:28,773
[SPEAKER_13]: Sincerely, Brown, Lungo-Koehn, Mayor.

1873
02:27:28,793 --> 02:27:31,375
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll go to Director Hunt.

1874
02:27:31,496 --> 02:27:39,844
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sure we will all appreciate a brief update on this as we have received perhaps various extensive presentations on the MacLennan playground.

1875
02:27:39,924 --> 02:27:44,008
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you could provide us a little more information on what is before us.

1876
02:27:45,329 --> 02:27:46,390
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Madam President.

1877
02:27:48,892 --> 02:27:52,174
[SPEAKER_01]: This, so I am not planning to present on the project.

1878
02:27:52,194 --> 02:27:53,595
[SPEAKER_01]: The project has not changed.

1879
02:27:53,795 --> 02:27:56,817
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything that the council has seen in the past is the same.

1880
02:27:57,517 --> 02:28:06,763
[SPEAKER_01]: The project went out to bid, we got bids in, and we had pulled together some additional funding, including a state earmark for $100,000.

1881
02:28:07,143 --> 02:28:09,844
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you to representative Barber.

1882
02:28:11,245 --> 02:28:15,548
[SPEAKER_01]: But we were, and we have added additional CDBG money to this project as well.

1883
02:28:16,488 --> 02:28:23,214
[SPEAKER_01]: But in order to sign the contracts, we are still short on the amount that it costs to move this project forward.

1884
02:28:23,714 --> 02:28:25,456
[SPEAKER_01]: The city would very much like to do this.

1885
02:28:25,496 --> 02:28:27,237
[SPEAKER_01]: You all know how important this project is.

1886
02:28:27,738 --> 02:28:36,945
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is basically bringing in front of your body that we would like to increase the amount of ARPA funding to this project in order to sign the contracts.

1887
02:28:39,287 --> 02:28:39,928
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Director Hunt.

1888
02:28:40,972 --> 02:28:41,852
[SPEAKER_13]: Any questions from the council?

1889
02:28:41,872 --> 02:28:42,412
[SPEAKER_04]: None.

1890
02:28:42,532 --> 02:28:43,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to receive and place on file.

1891
02:28:44,453 --> 02:28:49,414
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion of Vice President Bears to receive and place on file, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

1892
02:28:49,454 --> 02:28:50,094
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

1893
02:28:50,114 --> 02:28:50,174
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

1894
02:28:50,875 --> 02:28:51,575
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

1895
02:28:51,635 --> 02:28:52,295
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

1896
02:28:52,315 --> 02:28:58,216
[SPEAKER_13]: 23-420, to the Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council, regarding donation acceptance.

1897
02:28:58,296 --> 02:29:00,417
[SPEAKER_13]: Dear President Morell and members of the Medford City Council,

1898
02:29:01,405 --> 02:29:16,230
[SPEAKER_13]: I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approves under Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 44, Section 53A, a donation of $600 from the First Baptist Church of Medford to the city of Medford for the use by the Medford Recreation Department towards the adaptive programs.

1899
02:29:16,290 --> 02:29:20,792
[SPEAKER_13]: This money will be used to purchase equipment to run our adaptive sports programs and teach life skills.

1900
02:29:21,212 --> 02:29:26,914
[SPEAKER_13]: Director of Recreation, Kevin Bailey, plans to be in attendance, but also has park commission meeting at the same time I see him.

1901
02:29:27,054 --> 02:29:30,475
[SPEAKER_13]: So I respectfully submit it, Brianna Lugo-Pierre.

1902
02:29:31,384 --> 02:29:33,346
[SPEAKER_13]: As you hear, if you want to.

1903
02:29:33,666 --> 02:29:35,367
[SPEAKER_09]: We outlasted the parks commission tonight.

1904
02:29:35,688 --> 02:29:36,709
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1905
02:29:36,869 --> 02:29:37,449
[SPEAKER_13]: After Kevin speaks.

1906
02:29:42,701 --> 02:29:54,567
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, just as the letter states, the Baptist Church would like to donate $600 to our adaptive programs.

1907
02:29:55,607 --> 02:30:05,312
[SPEAKER_17]: This really came about, one of the members of the church, their daughter participates in our adaptive programs, really likes the programs that we have to offer.

1908
02:30:05,472 --> 02:30:10,855
[SPEAKER_17]: Kate Quinn, who is our program manager and oversees the adaptive program,

1909
02:30:11,658 --> 02:30:23,983
[SPEAKER_17]: really has bonded with her daughter and she would like to try to help with this program, help get more equipment, staffing or anything else that we need to help grow our adaptive programs.

1910
02:30:24,824 --> 02:30:27,525
[SPEAKER_17]: So again, she's a member of the church and

1911
02:30:28,098 --> 02:30:32,741
[SPEAKER_17]: the church would like to donate that $600 to help with the equipment expenses.

1912
02:30:33,361 --> 02:30:34,842
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1913
02:30:35,382 --> 02:30:39,484
[SPEAKER_06]: First, I'd like to move approval on the donation, but just a little bit on Kevin.

1914
02:30:39,544 --> 02:30:42,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Kevin and I are colleagues now in different communities, but we often

1915
02:30:43,479 --> 02:30:44,239
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, collaborate.

1916
02:30:44,459 --> 02:30:48,381
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, I don't think people realize how lucky we are to have Kevin here.

1917
02:30:49,061 --> 02:31:05,826
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, the adaptive program, I know I've been trying very hard for years to get it off the ground, and Summerville making sure that, uh, we are full inclusionary, making sure that all of our young people and adults have an opportunity to participate in multiple recreation opportunities.

1918
02:31:06,387 --> 02:31:10,128
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, you know, when you have, uh, a leader like Kevin,

1919
02:31:10,788 --> 02:31:13,189
[SPEAKER_06]: who presents these programs.

1920
02:31:13,249 --> 02:31:23,972
[SPEAKER_06]: I know he works very closely with partners across the state, and now you're having different organizations donating, and thank you for that organization to donate.

1921
02:31:24,012 --> 02:31:26,373
[SPEAKER_06]: That's very kind of them, and I know it's gonna go a long way.

1922
02:31:27,433 --> 02:31:33,235
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd be remiss to say I'm a little jealous tonight because this, I believe it's this week,

1923
02:31:35,161 --> 02:31:41,468
[SPEAKER_06]: Coming up soon, Kevin was asked to be a representative, I believe, to speak.

1924
02:31:42,122 --> 02:31:57,348
[SPEAKER_06]: be the keynote speaker at the Recreation on the Statehouse and Kevin will be speaking on recreation and that's a huge feather in his cap for what he's done in a very short time with very limited basis.

1925
02:31:57,768 --> 02:32:08,532
[SPEAKER_06]: To be honest with you, I can't tell you, I won't tell you publicly what our department and I won't tell you that I have 12 full-time employees and 100 part-time employees.

1926
02:32:09,313 --> 02:32:28,894
[SPEAKER_06]: and to see what Kevin does with only three full-time employees and only a few part-time employees I think it's a huge feather in his cap and I think it's something has to be acknowledged publicly that when you are asked to speak at the Statehouse and out of all of the recreation departments

1927
02:32:31,637 --> 02:32:36,883
[SPEAKER_06]: across the Commonwealth and having our director be that speaker, I think it should be mentioned.

1928
02:32:37,303 --> 02:32:38,244
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not jealous, though.

1929
02:32:38,645 --> 02:32:40,587
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not upset.

1930
02:32:40,707 --> 02:32:46,614
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not, I mean, just because he's probably stolen a thousand different ideas from me doesn't mean that it shouldn't be me.

1931
02:32:47,074 --> 02:32:50,038
[SPEAKER_06]: But on that note... Do you have a professional crush on Kevin?

1932
02:32:50,098 --> 02:32:50,758
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm joking, I'm joking.

1933
02:32:52,520 --> 02:33:15,982
[SPEAKER_06]: I do I do but again I appreciate Kevin's hard work but I had to mention that Kevin I'm sorry I know you get you get a little embarrassed about that but when we call you out on stuff like that but again when you have such limited limited funding and limited staffing but still do what you do I think it's a has to be mentioned when you

1934
02:33:17,590 --> 02:33:19,111
[SPEAKER_06]: as celebrated like you are right now.

1935
02:33:19,131 --> 02:33:19,651
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you.

1936
02:33:19,951 --> 02:33:20,272
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1937
02:33:20,632 --> 02:33:21,473
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Pastor Farfali.

1938
02:33:22,814 --> 02:33:23,394
[SPEAKER_13]: President Barras.

1939
02:33:25,196 --> 02:33:34,863
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great opening for me to talk about revenue and be a broken record, but as I won't do it, but imagine what Kevin could do.

1940
02:33:34,903 --> 02:33:38,006
[SPEAKER_14]: I apologize for my constituency.

1941
02:33:38,206 --> 02:33:41,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Imagine what Kevin could do with more resources and more funding, and I'll leave it at that.

1942
02:33:41,689 --> 02:33:43,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Madam President.

1943
02:33:44,576 --> 02:33:45,296
[SPEAKER_13]: And congrats, Kevin.

1944
02:33:45,437 --> 02:33:46,257
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for being here.

1945
02:33:46,277 --> 02:33:52,439
[SPEAKER_13]: So on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to accept a donation, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Kevin.

[SPEAKER_13]: Public participation.

1961
02:34:10,987 --> 02:34:11,047
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1962
02:34:15,162 --> 02:34:16,743
[SPEAKER_13]: before we do that.

1963
02:34:17,284 --> 02:34:25,308
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion of, sorry, we just have one paper, I forgot about, motion of Councilor Caraviello to take papers in the hands of the clerk under suspension, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

1964
02:34:25,328 --> 02:34:25,948
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

1965
02:34:26,008 --> 02:34:26,348
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

1966
02:34:26,829 --> 02:34:28,069
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

1967
02:34:28,089 --> 02:34:29,270
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

1968
02:34:29,290 --> 02:34:39,755
[SPEAKER_13]: 23-421, offered under suspension by Councilor Caraviello, be it so resolved that the Medford City Council request that the Subcommittee on Rules and Ordinances revise the ordinance on the number of occupants living in a household or dwelling.

1969
02:34:39,816 --> 02:34:41,136
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Caraviello.

1970
02:34:41,496 --> 02:34:42,197
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Madam President.

1971
02:34:43,160 --> 02:34:49,487
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think this might be an oversight on our part, and I talked to Councilor Bears about it earlier.

1972
02:34:49,527 --> 02:34:57,456
[SPEAKER_05]: When we re-codified the rules, I thought we had a number of people that are allowed to live in apartments.

1973
02:34:58,657 --> 02:35:02,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Counting on the rules, it doesn't say anything, so maybe it's a misprint or...

1974
02:35:04,605 --> 02:35:14,093
[SPEAKER_05]: something we have to change, but we kind of opened the door a couple of weeks ago when we started talking about the Airbnbs and all the apartments up at the hillside.

1975
02:35:15,454 --> 02:35:22,239
[SPEAKER_05]: And so when you go to the city now and you ask them for the rule, the rule is anybody, they can have a hundred people living there for right now.

1976
02:35:22,700 --> 02:35:31,987
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was just asked if the subcommittee could just update the rule notice to put a number in there of how many people should be living in an apartment or a dwelling.

1977
02:35:33,535 --> 02:35:42,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I just, you know, I went back and reviewed quickly the discussions that we had and the minutes or the reports committee reports.

1978
02:35:42,680 --> 02:35:44,961
[SPEAKER_04]: This is done in the zoning record of the court vacation that.

1979
02:35:45,760 --> 02:35:49,981
[SPEAKER_04]: the committee report state, this will not affect maximum occupancy requirements.

1980
02:35:50,041 --> 02:35:54,442
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think either we need to change the definition because there was something that wasn't included.

1981
02:35:54,522 --> 02:36:00,224
[SPEAKER_04]: That was from Attorney Wabrowski who said that in that committee report from February, 2022.

1982
02:36:01,664 --> 02:36:07,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Either we need to do that or there's somewhere else in there that we need to make sure that the building department knows is for their maximum occupancy.

1983
02:36:07,726 --> 02:36:11,387
[SPEAKER_05]: So what's happening is people are going to the building department now and complaining and they're saying, well,

1984
02:36:12,067 --> 02:36:13,068
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no number here.

1985
02:36:13,108 --> 02:36:13,828
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't help you.

1986
02:36:14,489 --> 02:36:19,133
[SPEAKER_05]: So I say, I don't know if it was an oversight or just something that didn't get put in there.

1987
02:36:19,173 --> 02:36:20,574
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we could just correct it.

1988
02:36:21,174 --> 02:36:26,158
[SPEAKER_05]: So the building department has something to give people when they come down.

1989
02:36:26,538 --> 02:36:28,119
[SPEAKER_04]: It's zoning, so we'll have to go through.

1990
02:36:28,880 --> 02:36:29,761
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have to figure that out.

1991
02:36:30,241 --> 02:36:32,022
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1992
02:36:32,083 --> 02:36:34,144
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion of Councilor Caraviello, seconded by-

1993
02:36:36,135 --> 02:36:39,176
[SPEAKER_08]: forward to us for the ordinance.

1994
02:36:39,376 --> 02:36:40,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Senator zoning.

1995
02:36:40,856 --> 02:36:41,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Senator zoning actually.

1996
02:36:42,217 --> 02:36:42,577
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1997
02:36:42,597 --> 02:36:48,299
[SPEAKER_13]: So on the motion of Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1998
02:36:48,359 --> 02:36:48,959
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

1999
02:36:48,979 --> 02:36:49,399
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

2000
02:36:49,779 --> 02:36:50,439
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

2001
02:36:50,479 --> 02:36:51,179
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

2002
02:36:52,020 --> 02:36:53,500
[SPEAKER_13]: Going to public participation.

2003
02:36:54,760 --> 02:36:55,281
[SPEAKER_15]: You're all ready.

2004
02:36:55,441 --> 02:36:55,681
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

2005
02:36:55,721 --> 02:36:56,981
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

2006
02:36:57,401 --> 02:36:58,862
[SPEAKER_15]: Mariana Ducey, 2 Nod Street.

2007
02:36:59,442 --> 02:37:00,302
[SPEAKER_15]: This goes to what

2008
02:37:00,855 --> 02:37:11,638
[SPEAKER_15]: Council Curry Scarpelli was saying before when you were talking about the development of Medford Square and everything about you need an overall plan to see how it impacts the rest of the neighborhood.

2009
02:37:12,079 --> 02:37:14,739
[SPEAKER_15]: This goes back to the walk-in court development.

2010
02:37:16,240 --> 02:37:26,143
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think there's been enough discussion or Disclosure maybe is the right word of what how this is going to affect the surrounding residential neighborhood.

2011
02:37:26,163 --> 02:37:26,183
[SPEAKER_15]: I

2012
02:37:27,506 --> 02:37:36,595
[SPEAKER_15]: When they had the meeting of the whole last week, the housing authority got up and said that, I asked actually, what were the benefits to the neighborhood?

2013
02:37:36,615 --> 02:37:40,940
[SPEAKER_15]: Because they were touting that there were benefits in their letters that they had the residents sign.

2014
02:37:41,640 --> 02:37:44,683
[SPEAKER_15]: And they said that they were gonna have a polling place for voting.

2015
02:37:44,724 --> 02:37:46,145
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, that exists today.

2016
02:37:46,746 --> 02:37:47,787
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not a benefit.

2017
02:37:48,729 --> 02:37:51,491
[SPEAKER_15]: It's actually benefiting the city to provide a polling place there.

2018
02:37:52,492 --> 02:37:58,736
[SPEAKER_15]: And then they said there's going to be a cut through in their fence that would take people through to Whole Foods if you wanted to walk through.

2019
02:37:58,756 --> 02:37:59,856
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, that exists today.

2020
02:38:00,457 --> 02:38:02,138
[SPEAKER_15]: That's really not a new benefit.

2021
02:38:03,158 --> 02:38:08,722
[SPEAKER_15]: So and then he said something about, you know, if there are residents in the neighborhood who start to age and they need

2022
02:38:09,547 --> 02:38:15,252
[SPEAKER_15]: to move into a housing authority building or something, you know, Walkley Court is right there.

2023
02:38:15,292 --> 02:38:18,174
[SPEAKER_15]: But that means you have to go on a wait list.

2024
02:38:18,334 --> 02:38:21,476
[SPEAKER_15]: Doesn't necessarily mean you're gonna get an apartment at Walkley Court.

2025
02:38:22,137 --> 02:38:23,938
[SPEAKER_15]: You may get one if you have to wait long enough.

2026
02:38:24,879 --> 02:38:30,423
[SPEAKER_15]: So from what he said, he didn't state any benefits.

2027
02:38:30,463 --> 02:38:32,485
[SPEAKER_15]: He also didn't state any negatives.

2028
02:38:32,925 --> 02:38:38,389
[SPEAKER_15]: Now there may be negatives that they're not disclosing, like traffic, noise, activity.

2029
02:38:39,292 --> 02:38:39,932
[SPEAKER_15]: whatever else.

2030
02:38:40,973 --> 02:38:51,661
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's why it's important, as Councilor Scarpelli was saying, when you do a project, you have to look at the whole picture, not just the development that you're doing.

2031
02:38:54,023 --> 02:39:02,729
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, I don't know if any of you have any questions to the letter that I passed out last week, but I decided to look at the

2032
02:39:03,341 --> 02:39:30,723
[SPEAKER_15]: Signers of the petition because someone to the public at the meeting that they had with the Community Development Board Questioned the validity of some of the signatures that I got I got back on the call and I said no everyone that I Approached for that petition was shown a design copy of the design I explained how each one of the buildings were going to be used and then they decided whether they wanted to sign it or not I didn't break down who I

2033
02:39:31,444 --> 02:39:36,485
[SPEAKER_15]: spoke to, but just for an FYI here, I spoke to five firemen.

2034
02:39:37,705 --> 02:39:39,826
[SPEAKER_15]: One from Somerville, four from Medford.

2035
02:39:40,406 --> 02:39:44,287
[SPEAKER_15]: One of those is active, and the others were retired.

2036
02:39:45,107 --> 02:39:50,628
[SPEAKER_15]: Two of those retired ones were deputy, lieutenant deputy chiefs.

2037
02:39:51,008 --> 02:39:53,048
[SPEAKER_15]: So they're senior people in the fire department.

2038
02:39:53,609 --> 02:39:56,529
[SPEAKER_15]: I talked to one retired Medford police officer.

2039
02:39:57,629 --> 02:40:00,250
[SPEAKER_15]: I talked to one elected Medford city official.

2040
02:40:02,343 --> 02:40:05,105
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not gonna say who, but he's elected by the public.

2041
02:40:07,967 --> 02:40:17,713
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, I talked to a City of Medford appointee who was a building contractor who actually chased me down.

2042
02:40:18,173 --> 02:40:20,955
[SPEAKER_15]: I was walking home one night and he stopped me.

2043
02:40:20,995 --> 02:40:22,316
[SPEAKER_15]: He said, are you the one with the petition?

2044
02:40:22,336 --> 02:40:23,116
[SPEAKER_15]: And I said, yes.

2045
02:40:23,676 --> 02:40:25,498
[SPEAKER_15]: He says, can I see the design and everything?

2046
02:40:25,538 --> 02:40:28,459
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I showed it to him and he said, I wanna sign it.

2047
02:40:28,659 --> 02:40:29,360
[SPEAKER_15]: So he signed it.

2048
02:40:30,681 --> 02:40:34,544
[SPEAKER_15]: and he said he didn't like the relocation of the seniors part of it.

2049
02:40:36,125 --> 02:40:44,151
[SPEAKER_15]: I spoke to the spouse of an appointed Medford official who's a carpenter, didn't like the design, signed the petition.

2050
02:40:45,472 --> 02:40:52,377
[SPEAKER_15]: I talked to two builders who didn't think the design was good, and they signed the petition.

2051
02:40:52,557 --> 02:40:54,758
[SPEAKER_15]: They're just private builders.

2052
02:40:56,440 --> 02:40:59,362
[SPEAKER_15]: A landscape designer, I met her on the street,

2053
02:41:00,266 --> 02:41:02,828
[SPEAKER_15]: She was walking home, and I showed her the design.

2054
02:41:03,349 --> 02:41:06,152
[SPEAKER_15]: And she said, where's all the green space?

2055
02:41:06,372 --> 02:41:08,574
[SPEAKER_15]: They've used up all the green space with buildings.

2056
02:41:10,316 --> 02:41:11,897
[SPEAKER_15]: She said, this is not a good plan.

2057
02:41:12,037 --> 02:41:13,078
[SPEAKER_15]: So she signed the petition.

2058
02:41:14,640 --> 02:41:19,985
[SPEAKER_15]: I have one building who built and installed today's community garden there.

2059
02:41:21,137 --> 02:41:23,579
[SPEAKER_15]: And he said, where are they going to put the community garden?

2060
02:41:23,819 --> 02:41:25,460
[SPEAKER_15]: And I said, up against the tracks.

2061
02:41:25,500 --> 02:41:27,762
[SPEAKER_15]: I showed him on the design where the gardens were going to go.

2062
02:41:28,222 --> 02:41:29,763
[SPEAKER_15]: He said, it's not going to get any sun there.

2063
02:41:30,083 --> 02:41:33,766
[SPEAKER_15]: Besides which, all the vegetables are going to be covered with diesel pollution.

2064
02:41:35,047 --> 02:41:36,007
[SPEAKER_15]: He signed the petition.

2065
02:41:38,029 --> 02:41:48,056
[SPEAKER_15]: A person who works for a private company who finds affordable housing for low-income people, private company, she said the design wasn't good.

2066
02:41:49,076 --> 02:41:49,857
[SPEAKER_15]: It was too crowded.

2067
02:41:50,388 --> 02:41:51,288
[SPEAKER_15]: She signed the petition.

2068
02:41:52,269 --> 02:42:01,771
[SPEAKER_15]: Then I spoke to an architect and a spouse who said the design was too crowded, the capacity there was overcrowded.

2069
02:42:02,652 --> 02:42:14,055
[SPEAKER_15]: They said that they could not sign the petition because being in the profession that they are, they do a lot of work with the city of Medford, so they felt that they didn't want to jeopardize their business by signing the petition, but they agreed.

2070
02:42:14,732 --> 02:42:15,612
[SPEAKER_15]: that it was too crowded.

2071
02:42:15,653 --> 02:42:16,913
[SPEAKER_15]: They volunteered that to me.

2072
02:42:18,154 --> 02:42:30,360
[SPEAKER_15]: I spoke to a City of Medford appointee, who's an architect, who said they had a lot of concerns with the project, but couldn't sign it because of their appointment by the City of Medford.

2073
02:42:31,981 --> 02:42:40,666
[SPEAKER_15]: However, this person's mother-in-law lives at Walkling Court, so is very familiar with Walkling Court, and the spouse signed the petition.

2074
02:42:42,802 --> 02:42:58,330
[SPEAKER_15]: An adult child of an elected Medford State official who didn't think the design was good but couldn't sign a petition because they had the same name as the elected official and they would be mistaken by the persons who look into the petition.

2075
02:42:58,971 --> 02:43:00,792
[SPEAKER_15]: They would think it was the official.

2076
02:43:02,373 --> 02:43:12,098
[SPEAKER_15]: One advocate who funds housing for homeless veterans, finds housing for homeless vets who said they did not like

2077
02:43:14,287 --> 02:43:16,167
[SPEAKER_15]: putting the seniors up against the tracks.

2078
02:43:18,688 --> 02:43:23,809
[SPEAKER_15]: So the person did not want to sign the petition, but said they were going to send in their own comments.

2079
02:43:24,510 --> 02:43:29,551
[SPEAKER_15]: Now at the time, I didn't know who the authority was who was going to be making the judgments here.

2080
02:43:30,091 --> 02:43:33,472
[SPEAKER_15]: So I told them to look at the housing authority's website.

2081
02:43:34,230 --> 02:43:36,792
[SPEAKER_15]: You could see more designs and more explanation there.

2082
02:43:36,972 --> 02:43:39,154
[SPEAKER_15]: And I said, send your comments into the housing authority.

2083
02:43:39,434 --> 02:43:41,996
[SPEAKER_15]: And then later on, I said, send it into the mayor.

2084
02:43:42,356 --> 02:43:46,619
[SPEAKER_15]: Had I known it was going to be the Community Development Board, I would have sent them the comments there.

2085
02:43:46,639 --> 02:43:48,440
[SPEAKER_15]: I actually would have sent them to the city council.

2086
02:43:49,501 --> 02:43:54,845
[SPEAKER_15]: And then several other people who did not want to sign the petition because they didn't know enough about the project.

2087
02:43:55,313 --> 02:44:02,979
[SPEAKER_15]: I also referred them to the Housing Authority's website and also told them if they wanted to send in their own comments, they could send in their own comments.

2088
02:44:03,839 --> 02:44:06,241
[SPEAKER_15]: So that was that.

2089
02:44:07,142 --> 02:44:22,673
[SPEAKER_15]: Then the woman who spoke at the Committee of the Whole last week, who lives on Orchard Street, I think she was trying to help the situation, but she actually pointed out

2090
02:44:23,337 --> 02:44:27,059
[SPEAKER_15]: the damage that has been done to her house from the trains.

2091
02:44:27,480 --> 02:44:35,885
[SPEAKER_15]: She has cracked foundation, cracked windows, the shingles on her house are deteriorated from the pollution, I guess.

2092
02:44:37,378 --> 02:44:43,540
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, this is gonna be the effects of the trains for those senior buildings that are gonna be up the tracks.

2093
02:44:43,600 --> 02:44:53,182
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, modern buildings are stronger than a single family house, but, however, I mean, it's quite a bit of vibration to crack foundations.

2094
02:44:55,863 --> 02:45:02,145
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, to get back to putting the seniors on the tracks, this is a personal story.

2095
02:45:02,165 --> 02:45:03,145
[SPEAKER_15]: You're gonna think it's crazy,

2096
02:45:04,103 --> 02:45:07,584
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, 110 years ago, my grandparents came from Italy.

2097
02:45:07,604 --> 02:45:11,505
[SPEAKER_15]: And they came with basically just the clothes on their backs.

2098
02:45:12,705 --> 02:45:20,347
[SPEAKER_15]: And the only place they could find affordable housing was on railroad tracks in East Cambridge.

2099
02:45:22,547 --> 02:45:27,429
[SPEAKER_15]: And those tracks were freight train tracks, because there was a meatpacking house there.

2100
02:45:27,469 --> 02:45:28,709
[SPEAKER_15]: They used to slaughter animals.

2101
02:45:28,789 --> 02:45:30,469
[SPEAKER_15]: And there was a lumberyard.

2102
02:45:30,509 --> 02:45:31,770
[SPEAKER_15]: And there was a coal yard.

2103
02:45:34,215 --> 02:45:43,158
[SPEAKER_15]: But anyway, no one wanted to live on the tracks, and that's the only reason that these poor immigrants could get a place to live there, because it was cheap and nobody else wanted to live there.

2104
02:45:44,258 --> 02:45:46,799
[SPEAKER_15]: So here we are 110 years later.

2105
02:45:47,960 --> 02:45:51,381
[SPEAKER_15]: As a society, haven't we come beyond that now?

2106
02:45:51,761 --> 02:45:53,642
[SPEAKER_15]: We're gonna still put people on the tracks?

2107
02:45:54,442 --> 02:45:55,322
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, think about it.

2108
02:45:56,502 --> 02:45:59,363
[SPEAKER_15]: Haven't we come and progressed in 110 years not to do this?

2109
02:46:02,258 --> 02:46:04,541
[SPEAKER_15]: So those are just thoughts I'd like to leave with you.

2110
02:46:04,661 --> 02:46:10,889
[SPEAKER_15]: Just, I mean, it's not time for to vote yet, but just when you're digesting everything, just consider those facts.

2111
02:46:10,909 --> 02:46:12,672
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, thank you.

2112
02:46:12,692 --> 02:46:27,210
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, this much passes me.

2113
02:46:28,752 --> 02:46:29,153
[SPEAKER_13]: Overruled.
