1
00:00:02,493 --> 00:00:04,554
All right, it's 6.01.

2
00:00:06,036 --> 00:00:08,698
Technically, we have quorum, so we can go ahead and get started.

3
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:10,859
I think Hasita was going to join.

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,682
I don't know about Kristen.

5
00:00:14,542 --> 00:00:15,963
But we can go ahead and get started.

6
00:00:15,983 --> 00:00:16,984
I'm going to record.

7
00:00:17,004 --> 00:00:24,310
And actually, before I hit record, folks that are at home, is there any sort of background noise?

8
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:25,851
We have the windows open right now.

9
00:00:25,951 --> 00:00:28,433
Are you guys hearing any sort of traffic noise that's loud?

10
00:00:29,343 --> 00:00:30,204
Fantastic.

11
00:00:30,284 --> 00:00:30,484
Good.

12
00:00:30,604 --> 00:00:31,424
I just wanted to make sure.

13
00:00:31,444 --> 00:00:33,705
Am I supposed to have any?

14
00:00:34,346 --> 00:00:38,048
No, if you want, there's a copy of it in Agenda here if you want to just follow along.

15
00:00:38,108 --> 00:00:39,088
Yeah.

16
00:00:39,388 --> 00:00:42,470
But yeah, if you want to doodle, there you go.

17
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,751
All right.

18
00:00:44,931 --> 00:00:45,772
Now I'm going to record.

19
00:00:46,392 --> 00:00:47,633
Recording in progress.

20
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:49,634
Okay.

21
00:00:49,854 --> 00:00:55,957
This is the Medford Historic District Commission meeting by hybrid means on August 14th, 2025 at 6 PM.

22
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:02,928
We are in room 201 at City Hall, as well as meeting via video conference to Zoom.

23
00:01:04,169 --> 00:01:06,130
So thank you, everybody, for making it tonight.

24
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:07,271
Joe, do you want to?

25
00:01:08,211 --> 00:01:08,371
Sure.

26
00:01:08,391 --> 00:01:08,832
How are you doing?

27
00:01:08,852 --> 00:01:10,132
How are you doing, everybody?

28
00:01:10,172 --> 00:01:13,374
So we're going to do three things out of the agenda here.

29
00:01:13,675 --> 00:01:16,696
We're going to do the meeting minutes hopefully next month.

30
00:01:18,377 --> 00:01:19,898
So we're going to discuss.

31
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:30,643
a meeting time that we can all get together and walk the South Street District area and figure out where we're going to put the signage.

32
00:01:31,984 --> 00:01:49,170
Then we're going to have a discussion of holding a joint meeting with the Historical Commission, which is the other commission in Medford, to discuss an overall plan for the city about historical preservation of the properties of Medford.

33
00:01:49,951 --> 00:01:50,491
And then

34
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:57,611
A couple weeks ago in the email we got the Senate bill.

35
00:01:58,211 --> 00:01:59,712
The housing production bill.

36
00:01:59,732 --> 00:02:01,192
Yeah, housing production bill number 993.

37
00:02:01,232 --> 00:02:03,913
So this hasn't been voted on yet.

38
00:02:03,953 --> 00:02:10,576
So we have an opportunity to weigh in on it and voice our opinions of what.

39
00:02:10,616 --> 00:02:11,256
What's that again?

40
00:02:11,296 --> 00:02:12,196
What bill is it?

41
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:12,196
993.

42
00:02:12,857 --> 00:02:14,897
For what?

43
00:02:14,997 --> 00:02:15,798
It's regarding

44
00:02:17,225 --> 00:02:27,192
Uh, housing and receiving, uh, historical districts authority in regards to changing the zoning.

45
00:02:27,252 --> 00:02:30,874
Yeah, some jurisdictional changes that that bill were to pass.

46
00:02:31,154 --> 00:02:31,454
So.

47
00:02:32,615 --> 00:02:39,640
All right, so let's start with the, uh, with the South Street site visit and signage plan update.

48
00:02:41,081 --> 00:02:41,301
Yes.

49
00:02:43,113 --> 00:02:49,038
Um, so, uh, South Street is our latest and greatest district is currently lacking signage.

50
00:02:49,298 --> 00:02:53,582
So, um, also, it'd be really great for this commission where we're a newer commission.

51
00:02:53,902 --> 00:02:56,725
Um, I know some of us have Joe has been here.

52
00:02:57,005 --> 00:03:01,929
Um, and as well as Charlotte throughout the duration, but it would be good to get out there and walk the site.

53
00:03:01,989 --> 00:03:04,071
It's a, it's a pretty walkable street.

54
00:03:04,191 --> 00:03:05,432
Everybody knows South Street.

55
00:03:06,828 --> 00:03:15,792
So those who are able to join us, I think it would be good for us to walk the site and to discuss permanent signage locations.

56
00:03:17,253 --> 00:03:25,997
So get our hands on the district, if you will, put our eyes on it and familiarize ourselves with it as well as to identify those signage locations.

57
00:03:29,135 --> 00:03:29,935
We can pick some dates.

58
00:03:30,015 --> 00:03:33,796
I can round robin it after this meeting, or we can discuss it now.

59
00:03:33,876 --> 00:03:38,617
But it would be good to put something on the calendar, since it would be a public event.

60
00:03:39,057 --> 00:03:40,518
We would have to advertise it.

61
00:03:40,578 --> 00:03:44,499
So it's not something we can just all text each other and say, hey, what are you doing Saturday night?

62
00:03:45,399 --> 00:03:47,159
We would have to properly advertise it.

63
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,980
So a lot of people are welcome.

64
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,500
Is that it?

65
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,821
Yeah, the public would be welcome as well.

66
00:03:53,781 --> 00:03:56,142
I'm not sure how much participation we'd have from the public.

67
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:57,602
I'm sure we'll have some neighbors comment.

68
00:03:58,113 --> 00:03:59,054
It would be nice if they did.

69
00:03:59,194 --> 00:04:00,454
Yeah, it would be nice if they did.

70
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:10,100
But, you know, the intention of this would be for us to all familiarize ourselves with the district itself and, you know, to pound the pavement at it.

71
00:04:10,521 --> 00:04:11,401
But it would be public.

72
00:04:11,421 --> 00:04:12,502
People would be welcome.

73
00:04:12,522 --> 00:04:16,664
Bring your friends.

74
00:04:16,945 --> 00:04:19,106
So I'm open to any weeknight.

75
00:04:19,186 --> 00:04:20,747
It would be difficult for me on a weekend.

76
00:04:23,122 --> 00:04:25,243
And I would, so we would have to be next month.

77
00:04:25,283 --> 00:04:32,305
So we're still going to, you know, sunset would still be, you know, before seven, you know?

78
00:04:32,325 --> 00:04:43,389
So, I mean, what, what night would work out for everybody like prior to, you know, like, let's say six o'clock so that that way, you know, when seven, when it starts getting dark, we'd already be done at that point.

79
00:04:43,709 --> 00:04:50,031
What, what time around, what day on six o'clock would be good for you guys like next, um, next month?

80
00:04:50,671 --> 00:04:52,712
I'd have to check my calendar, but probably

81
00:04:53,385 --> 00:04:53,925
Any time.

82
00:04:55,547 --> 00:04:57,488
Is there like a day of the week that might work best?

83
00:04:57,928 --> 00:05:02,312
No, I'm both retired, so I'm doing nothing, unfortunately.

84
00:05:02,352 --> 00:05:04,073
So I live on South Street.

85
00:05:04,393 --> 00:05:05,014
Oh, yeah, perfect.

86
00:05:05,034 --> 00:05:05,454
That's right.

87
00:05:05,934 --> 00:05:07,495
So it's not a long walk.

88
00:05:07,535 --> 00:05:10,177
You don't have to walk far to get there.

89
00:05:10,197 --> 00:05:10,718
No, I don't.

90
00:05:10,818 --> 00:05:12,959
I'm thinking maybe Tuesday will work.

91
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,862
Tuesday's the best for you, Charlotte?

92
00:05:15,942 --> 00:05:16,102
OK.

93
00:05:16,562 --> 00:05:17,423
What about you, James?

94
00:05:18,163 --> 00:05:18,824
Tuesday's work.

95
00:05:18,904 --> 00:05:20,245
I'm pretty much open to any night, though.

96
00:05:24,361 --> 00:05:27,402
Yeah, I'd say I agree with Tuesday as well.

97
00:05:27,882 --> 00:05:33,583
I have meetings in Cambridge, and I tend to work from home in the morning.

98
00:05:33,623 --> 00:05:36,884
And I could always just extend that into the afternoon and be in Medford.

99
00:05:38,025 --> 00:05:43,626
I would not be available to do that until the week of the 15th in September.

100
00:05:43,646 --> 00:05:43,686
OK.

101
00:05:46,227 --> 00:05:47,307
Because I'll be out of town.

102
00:05:48,186 --> 00:05:51,171
early in September, but after that, but don't let that stop you.

103
00:05:51,491 --> 00:05:54,056
But that's when I would be around after the 15th and after.

104
00:05:54,116 --> 00:05:54,296
Okay.

105
00:06:00,082 --> 00:06:17,131
So why don't we say like the 16th and we could send, if it'd be okay, could we send everyone an email and then everyone can check and then get back within the next couple of days to confirm and then we'll just consider that a hot date and then post it for the community to know?

106
00:06:17,311 --> 00:06:19,432
You can meet at my house if that's okay.

107
00:06:19,672 --> 00:06:20,072
Yeah, great.

108
00:06:20,192 --> 00:06:20,712
I don't mind.

109
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:21,393
That's awesome.

110
00:06:21,433 --> 00:06:21,733
Sure.

111
00:06:21,753 --> 00:06:23,994
I haven't thought we can meet on, you know.

112
00:06:24,014 --> 00:06:25,035
Yeah, that's a great idea.

113
00:06:25,075 --> 00:06:26,435
Like a central meeting spot.

114
00:06:26,475 --> 00:06:26,876
That's great.

115
00:06:26,996 --> 00:06:27,476
Yeah.

116
00:06:27,915 --> 00:06:55,048
okay so let's tentatively plan for tuesday september 6th at 16th i'm sorry 16th at 6 p.m 6 30. all right let's do six okay that works for me that works september 16th which is a tuesday right tuesday september 16th at 6 p.m and like like you said i'll circulate that and if it doesn't work for the majority we can get from there but i

117
00:06:55,688 --> 00:06:56,509
I think it should be fine.

118
00:06:56,569 --> 00:06:56,849
Yeah.

119
00:06:56,889 --> 00:06:57,369
Yeah.

120
00:06:57,429 --> 00:06:59,811
We're 15th or 16th.

121
00:06:59,851 --> 00:07:02,392
16th of Tuesday, September 16th.

122
00:07:02,432 --> 00:07:03,673
Yeah.

123
00:07:05,074 --> 00:07:05,314
Great.

124
00:07:05,534 --> 00:07:09,857
So, yeah, I'll, I'll round robin that with everybody and email, make sure we're good.

125
00:07:09,977 --> 00:07:14,040
And then I was just wrapped with this time again, 6 and 6 PM.

126
00:07:15,681 --> 00:07:17,081
Oh, it should only take us maybe.

127
00:07:19,118 --> 00:07:22,840
I think an hour maximum here, you know, we're all chatting Kathy's.

128
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,480
I'm joking.

129
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:27,843
We can have some nice discussions, but plan it for an hour or so.

130
00:07:27,863 --> 00:07:29,063
Perfect.

131
00:07:30,044 --> 00:07:30,384
Awesome.

132
00:07:30,564 --> 00:07:31,344
Yay.

133
00:07:32,445 --> 00:07:34,586
And then I can.

134
00:07:34,606 --> 00:07:36,287
I was starting in September.

135
00:07:36,367 --> 00:07:37,288
Is that the question?

136
00:07:37,388 --> 00:07:38,988
Is that the proposal?

137
00:07:39,529 --> 00:07:40,209
Or August?

138
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:42,450
September.

139
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,071
September.

140
00:07:43,091 --> 00:07:43,211
Yeah.

141
00:07:43,271 --> 00:07:44,571
Tuesday the 16th.

142
00:07:46,631 --> 00:07:51,413
And that gives us enough time to get to post it so that we meet our criteria.

143
00:07:51,433 --> 00:07:51,693
Perfect.

144
00:07:51,773 --> 00:07:52,033
Yeah.

145
00:07:52,053 --> 00:07:54,474
Technically, we only need 48 hours.

146
00:07:54,614 --> 00:07:55,094
Oh, yeah.

147
00:07:55,254 --> 00:07:56,655
That's good.

148
00:07:56,835 --> 00:07:58,616
So what are the signs going to say?

149
00:07:59,456 --> 00:08:02,097
That's something we can certainly kind of flesh out on site.

150
00:08:02,137 --> 00:08:13,121
I can bring some I'll bring photos of our existing signage and our other districts that are in need of updating their old and delaminating and just kind of falling apart.

151
00:08:13,141 --> 00:08:15,142
So I'll bring some examples of what we currently have.

152
00:08:15,653 --> 00:08:23,076
Maybe I can put together a handout of, you know, what other cities do for their historic district signage.

153
00:08:23,556 --> 00:08:31,579
You know, Joe and I were kind of sidebarring earlier, but I love the idea of making it, not having it be just like a blank sale sign.

154
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:34,460
It should be historic in its appearance as well.

155
00:08:36,361 --> 00:08:42,343
So I'll bring some examples and we can kind of all vote or something like that and then flush it out later.

156
00:08:43,047 --> 00:08:49,152
I think the location is important for us to get with, because that way, that'll dictate how many signs we're going to order.

157
00:08:49,992 --> 00:08:51,974
And that way, I can get appropriate pricing.

158
00:08:52,494 --> 00:09:01,061
The other districts just have one sign per district on the main thoroughfare that attracts the district, from what I could see.

159
00:09:01,281 --> 00:09:03,022
Norm Simmons has three.

160
00:09:03,202 --> 00:09:03,523
Do they?

161
00:09:04,363 --> 00:09:04,583
OK.

162
00:09:04,784 --> 00:09:07,926
They've got one right past the Winter Street Circle.

163
00:09:08,046 --> 00:09:09,107
One is turned down.

164
00:09:11,161 --> 00:09:13,022
I don't remember the name of that street, but there's there.

165
00:09:13,062 --> 00:09:14,102
I think there's at least two.

166
00:09:14,182 --> 00:09:17,284
I think there are three from our Simmons, but he'll say it's just one.

167
00:09:17,584 --> 00:09:19,285
Yeah, that's a tough one to find.

168
00:09:19,405 --> 00:09:19,805
Oh, it is.

169
00:09:20,205 --> 00:09:21,466
It's like in somebody's yard.

170
00:09:21,586 --> 00:09:23,667
Yeah.

171
00:09:24,107 --> 00:09:29,510
So, you know, maybe we look at the other districts to increase the number of science there as well.

172
00:09:30,363 --> 00:09:35,206
You had said, I believe, that they were interested in shipbuilder's house.

173
00:09:35,786 --> 00:09:38,688
Am I wrong in remembering that?

174
00:09:39,428 --> 00:09:40,269
I'm not sure.

175
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:47,392
Because my house was built by a shipbuilder.

176
00:09:47,933 --> 00:09:55,797
And I have a house in the back to the late 1700s that is still habitable.

177
00:09:55,917 --> 00:09:56,958
I have people renting it.

178
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,521
that is where the shipbuilding crew lived.

179
00:10:00,721 --> 00:10:01,161
Oh, nice.

180
00:10:01,562 --> 00:10:03,903
You go in, the ceilings are really, really low.

181
00:10:03,923 --> 00:10:04,403
Yeah.

182
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:05,723
And they all have beams.

183
00:10:06,524 --> 00:10:08,625
And it's officially rentable.

184
00:10:08,885 --> 00:10:10,485
I have the city come and look at it.

185
00:10:10,565 --> 00:10:10,766
Yeah.

186
00:10:10,806 --> 00:10:15,668
So even though, you know, a six-foot-two guy would have to go.

187
00:10:15,688 --> 00:10:17,188
Would have a hard time.

188
00:10:17,448 --> 00:10:18,869
But it's interesting.

189
00:10:19,169 --> 00:10:19,950
Yeah.

190
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:20,750
That is very cool.

191
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:27,513
Maybe down the road, we can look at more

192
00:10:29,775 --> 00:10:42,087
I forgot the name of the signage where, you know, you can put up a placard saying, like, oh, here lived Captain Isaac Paul, and he was the first one that followed your, you know, rain on his midnight ride.

193
00:10:42,828 --> 00:10:47,993
But maybe, like, that's something we can look at for more of our interesting homes in these districts.

194
00:10:48,013 --> 00:10:53,759
Maybe we can look at signage, additional signage specifically to that property down the road.

195
00:10:54,753 --> 00:10:57,534
I love the little story that you just shared there.

196
00:10:57,594 --> 00:11:03,877
What is that little house across from Brigham's on Governor's Ave?

197
00:11:04,157 --> 00:11:06,418
They have a whole folder on the history of my house.

198
00:11:06,558 --> 00:11:06,938
Yeah.

199
00:11:06,998 --> 00:11:08,199
It's interesting.

200
00:11:08,219 --> 00:11:08,299
Yeah.

201
00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:10,239
The historical society there.

202
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:14,681
That's something we can certainly look at as we get down the road.

203
00:11:14,721 --> 00:11:21,564
I think there's also, it's not on the agenda, but the city is also looking at wayfinding signage.

204
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:30,579
Wayfinding is like those directional signs if you're in the middle of the city saying like, oh, a five-minute walk this way to go to City Hall or a 10-minute walk that way to get to the Condon show.

205
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:37,444
So the city is right now looking at introducing a permanent wayfinding signage.

206
00:11:37,504 --> 00:11:39,926
So maybe we can dovetail some of this.

207
00:11:39,946 --> 00:11:43,349
That would help with the budget on that too, wouldn't it?

208
00:11:43,449 --> 00:11:43,729
It would.

209
00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:44,710
Very good.

210
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:46,171
We get creative here.

211
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:46,912
Fantastic.

212
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:47,272
I love it.

213
00:11:47,292 --> 00:11:49,373
I can't guarantee it, but it's an opportunity.

214
00:11:49,393 --> 00:11:49,774
Perfect.

215
00:11:51,727 --> 00:11:52,448
Awesome, okay.

216
00:11:53,328 --> 00:11:54,009
Oh, so windy.

217
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:57,031
I think a storm is about to come through, so.

218
00:11:57,512 --> 00:12:02,115
I'm dying for those heavens to open up and rain.

219
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:04,677
My tomatoes hate me right now.

220
00:12:06,018 --> 00:12:07,179
Okay, great.

221
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:10,142
Do we have to vote on anything of that or no?

222
00:12:14,365 --> 00:12:15,506
No, because it's not,

223
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:21,347
You know, any sort of decision written a decision, we're just going to do it.

224
00:12:21,367 --> 00:12:21,807
All right.

225
00:12:22,547 --> 00:12:22,787
Perfect.

226
00:12:22,807 --> 00:12:25,068
So we can move on to the 2nd item here.

227
00:12:25,088 --> 00:12:29,669
So the discussion of holding a joint public meeting with the historical commission.

228
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:29,969
So.

229
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:38,212
You've already spoken with them and they're, they're amendable to this and yeah, just as a little background.

230
00:12:40,007 --> 00:12:43,509
My day job is CPA grant manager for the city.

231
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:47,590
CPA also focuses on historic preservation citywide.

232
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,911
So this is an idea that really kind of came from me.

233
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:52,292
I'm creating more work for myself.

234
00:12:56,373 --> 00:12:57,654
Oh, sure.

235
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:00,515
Sorry, we heard something come from your microphone.

236
00:13:00,615 --> 00:13:08,018
Anyway, so other cities have put together what they call a citywide historic preservation plan.

237
00:13:08,938 --> 00:13:26,022
Um, there's always these various commissions and other cities and towns that are doing good historic efforts, but sometimes they work in silos and it's not cohesive about how we can best set up the city to protect our historical assets and our properties in the city.

238
00:13:26,042 --> 00:13:29,823
Um, the preservation plan would help.

239
00:13:30,827 --> 00:13:42,432
kind of bring all these various efforts and missions together to really put it into an actionable plan on how we can best preserve these buildings.

240
00:13:43,932 --> 00:13:49,975
You may have been aware that the city was looking at doing some residential rezoning updates.

241
00:13:50,855 --> 00:13:59,499
So this really kind of bubbled out of that conversation because frankly, some of the zoning, as it was proposed, you know, certainly there are,

242
00:14:00,017 --> 00:14:10,565
opportunities for revisions, but as it was proposed, would really incentivize these historic homes being taken down to put up a more denser, newer housing building.

243
00:14:10,585 --> 00:14:12,766
Which is not great, right?

244
00:14:12,806 --> 00:14:17,069
We're all here to help protect these buildings because once they're gone, you can't get them back on.

245
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:17,510
Yeah.

246
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:25,055
So long story short, that's just a backstory to explain why we would be looking at a preservation plan here for Medford.

247
00:14:25,736 --> 00:14:27,637
We're doing good stuff here on the district, but

248
00:14:28,543 --> 00:14:31,386
You know, it's 112 properties at this point that we're protecting.

249
00:14:31,426 --> 00:14:44,157
Meanwhile, there's thousands of other vulnerable historic homes right now that have no protections under the district or any other, you know, national registry or whatnot.

250
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:50,523
So all that to say, the historical commission is very much on board with helping with this.

251
00:14:51,404 --> 00:14:55,167
So they were thinking we should have a joint meeting just to talk about it.

252
00:14:55,778 --> 00:15:03,202
As the two boards for city hall that are tasked with historic stuff, you know, um, so the, the.

253
00:15:04,023 --> 00:15:15,049
And cut me off if you have any questions as I'm going here, but the idea of this joint meeting, which is to be able to talk about it, um, officially as a, Hey, this is what we're doing right now.

254
00:15:15,089 --> 00:15:18,271
We're, we're discussing the idea of holding that joint meeting.

255
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:20,632
Um, it's something that we all have to agree on.

256
00:15:21,517 --> 00:15:23,598
But that's the question.

257
00:15:23,938 --> 00:15:24,578
Yes, sure.

258
00:15:25,178 --> 00:15:29,720
A way historical district commission or just a historical commission.

259
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,780
We are the historic district commission.

260
00:15:33,081 --> 00:15:33,401
Okay.

261
00:15:33,621 --> 00:15:37,442
Then there is a separate entity called the historical commission.

262
00:15:38,122 --> 00:15:41,863
They're the ones that look at demo delays and.

263
00:15:43,184 --> 00:15:47,505
Determining the property is significant, so they're kind of.

264
00:15:48,497 --> 00:15:52,980
I don't wanna call them the lead organization for historical, but they tend to- Well, it's different.

265
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,541
Their property's not in the district.

266
00:15:55,661 --> 00:15:57,923
Ours are in an established district.

267
00:15:57,963 --> 00:16:02,706
They're determining historical significance of a home 75 years old, older.

268
00:16:02,926 --> 00:16:04,167
Correct.

269
00:16:04,307 --> 00:16:07,289
How far does the South Street district extend?

270
00:16:07,449 --> 00:16:10,511
Is it to any houses off of that?

271
00:16:10,931 --> 00:16:16,895
No, it is a little bit, I hate using the term gerrymander, because it's very prevalent in the news today.

272
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:22,582
I'm showing her a copy of the historic district for South Street here.

273
00:16:23,322 --> 00:16:25,624
But it's not every property on South Street.

274
00:16:26,344 --> 00:16:28,326
And you can see how it went up.

275
00:16:28,546 --> 00:16:30,807
It's nothing behind South Street either.

276
00:16:30,827 --> 00:16:32,308
It's nothing behind South Street.

277
00:16:32,328 --> 00:16:40,313
Yeah, because one of my neighbors who lives behind me sent me an email about what they want to do on Manning Street.

278
00:16:40,553 --> 00:16:41,874
They wanted to tear down a house.

279
00:16:43,626 --> 00:16:45,506
And do you know anything about that?

280
00:16:45,707 --> 00:16:48,587
I've heard it because I work in the planning department.

281
00:16:48,627 --> 00:16:50,108
So we've been talking about that one.

282
00:16:50,628 --> 00:16:51,528
I thought a little bit.

283
00:16:51,588 --> 00:16:58,209
I thought it had to go in front of the commission if it's 1910 or younger.

284
00:16:58,249 --> 00:17:01,050
Yeah, 75 years or older at this point.

285
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:05,311
So that year just rolls with it because it's 75 years.

286
00:17:05,431 --> 00:17:06,711
Yeah.

287
00:17:06,731 --> 00:17:08,172
But that is the historical commission.

288
00:17:08,212 --> 00:17:09,412
So they would review it.

289
00:17:10,772 --> 00:17:13,673
Yeah, I think it's on hold, but- I think so too.

290
00:17:14,873 --> 00:17:15,293
I don't know.

291
00:17:15,313 --> 00:17:15,593
Yeah.

292
00:17:15,853 --> 00:17:35,018
Because anytime a property that's 75 years or older wants to do some sort of exterior work to it, changing a roof line, extending a dormer, adding an addition, the historical commission makes a determination if that property is significant to Medford or significant to the area.

293
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:37,439
If they do deem it significant,

294
00:17:38,147 --> 00:17:41,349
then they can institute what they call an 18-month demo delay.

295
00:17:41,369 --> 00:17:42,350
That's what's happening.

296
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:42,690
Right.

297
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,931
If they want to demolish it and build something else.

298
00:17:45,192 --> 00:17:49,735
And some of these developers sitting on something for 18 months, they can do that.

299
00:17:49,755 --> 00:17:50,835
They can float that cash.

300
00:17:50,975 --> 00:17:54,057
So I think that's where that particular property is at right now.

301
00:17:56,899 --> 00:18:02,243
But so back to the joint meeting, is this something that this group would be amenable to?

302
00:18:03,645 --> 00:18:10,969
The preservation plan itself wouldn't be on the backs of everybody here, or even on my back, or the historical commissions.

303
00:18:11,009 --> 00:18:12,510
We would bring in a consultant.

304
00:18:14,311 --> 00:18:15,712
Other cities and towns have done that.

305
00:18:15,732 --> 00:18:24,297
They've essentially farmed the management of this project out to a consultant, so it actually gets done, which is nice.

306
00:18:25,296 --> 00:18:32,318
But so no fears of like Charlotte, you got to write 15 pages of preservation, you know, mission statement.

307
00:18:32,378 --> 00:18:33,378
That's not going to happen.

308
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:36,699
But you know, our input would be needed.

309
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:37,920
So.

310
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:45,482
So can we get, so are people amenable to having a joint meeting with the, with the historical historical commission?

311
00:18:46,242 --> 00:18:46,982
Okay.

312
00:18:47,122 --> 00:18:49,843
So let's, if someone could initiate a vote on that.

313
00:18:49,863 --> 00:18:52,364
Is there a motion to approve?

314
00:18:55,094 --> 00:18:56,815
Can I make that motion?

315
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:57,776
Am I allowed to?

316
00:18:58,216 --> 00:19:00,038
From the chair, no, unfortunately.

317
00:19:00,078 --> 00:19:11,647
So again, it's a motion on the table to engage in a joint public meeting with the purpose of hosting a public discussion about a preservation plan.

318
00:19:12,748 --> 00:19:13,809
So the motion to approve?

319
00:19:14,589 --> 00:19:15,570
Can I approve?

320
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:15,770
Yeah.

321
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:18,132
We've got a first motion from Anne Marie.

322
00:19:18,152 --> 00:19:20,214
Do we have a second?

323
00:19:21,315 --> 00:19:21,615
Second.

324
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:24,891
Want to do a roll call?

325
00:19:24,911 --> 00:19:27,032
Okay, so let's do a roll call vote on that.

326
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:27,632
James?

327
00:19:28,993 --> 00:19:29,234
Yes.

328
00:19:29,574 --> 00:19:29,754
Aye.

329
00:19:30,975 --> 00:19:31,295
Okay.

330
00:19:31,335 --> 00:19:31,755
Charlotte?

331
00:19:32,276 --> 00:19:32,556
Yes.

332
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:34,137
Annemarie?

333
00:19:34,677 --> 00:19:34,897
Yeah.

334
00:19:35,298 --> 00:19:35,658
Okay.

335
00:19:35,738 --> 00:19:37,839
And I vote yes too, so it should be all set.

336
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:38,920
Excellent.

337
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,241
Thank you very much.

338
00:19:40,281 --> 00:19:51,769
I think the dates on this one will be, I'll have to work with the historical commission, but I think what we'd do is just invite them to our next meeting in September.

339
00:19:51,909 --> 00:19:53,290
I believe this is September 11th meeting.

340
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:59,043
Um, so I don't think we have to do anything additional.

341
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:03,527
I have so connect with them, but that's the plan is to invite them to our next meeting.

342
00:20:03,587 --> 00:20:04,207
Okay.

343
00:20:04,407 --> 00:20:05,308
So it's great.

344
00:20:05,328 --> 00:20:06,169
We'll give you an email.

345
00:20:06,189 --> 00:20:09,732
I would know when, when that's going to be, if that's accepted.

346
00:20:09,752 --> 00:20:10,052
Perfect.

347
00:20:10,072 --> 00:20:10,452
That's great.

348
00:20:11,033 --> 00:20:20,040
So then, uh, last item here is the review of S nine, nine, three, the, uh, the housing, uh, production bill.

349
00:20:21,001 --> 00:20:21,061
Um,

350
00:20:22,623 --> 00:20:34,452
It was sent out, so it looks like the thing that most affects us is section six, which if you printed it off is one, two, it's on the third page.

351
00:20:35,773 --> 00:20:39,375
Would it be helpful for me to bring up the language on the screen?

352
00:20:39,395 --> 00:20:40,536
Yeah, that would be awesome.

353
00:20:40,556 --> 00:20:41,597
Yeah, I can do that.

354
00:21:09,379 --> 00:21:14,940
Thank you for your patience, folks.

355
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:21,821
I'm basically using a 70-inch monitor as my second screen, so sometimes it gets a little funky.

356
00:21:24,042 --> 00:21:32,243
Right, so everybody should be seeing our from mass.gov's website here.

357
00:21:33,135 --> 00:21:38,779
This is actually, so the, I don't know, do you want me to explain this?

358
00:21:38,879 --> 00:21:39,019
Okay.

359
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:40,180
You do it so well.

360
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:52,028
So S993, it is a proposed housing production bill, which essentially, there's a lot of housing production bills being considered right now at the Capitol.

361
00:21:53,869 --> 00:22:00,694
This one in particular isn't any more aggressive or anything

362
00:22:01,301 --> 00:22:02,842
it wouldn't produce more housing.

363
00:22:02,862 --> 00:22:06,805
The language in this one isn't very different from other housing bills that are proposed.

364
00:22:07,185 --> 00:22:28,218
However, this one does specifically have language in here that would effectively strip the historic district commission for being able to stop a demolition if it results in the project, the construction project results in one or more net new housing units.

365
00:22:30,158 --> 00:22:49,453
So what that means is, for instance, if somebody has a beautiful carriage house in their backyard and they want to knock it down and then build a bigger ADU, an accessory dwelling unit or housing unit, if this bill were to pass, we wouldn't be able to stop, prevent that carriage house from coming down.

366
00:22:51,795 --> 00:22:57,419
So, you know, it's, it's, does it affect a lot of properties here in Medford?

367
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:57,940
No.

368
00:22:58,404 --> 00:23:07,267
but it would, you know, we only have, I don't know off the top of my head, but like a dozen carriage houses in particular left here in Medford.

369
00:23:07,327 --> 00:23:17,110
And that was, you know, that's something that's, that we love seeing, you know, that's, that's a historical architectural feature that is very unique to, to what we still have left here in Medford.

370
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:22,871
So I don't think this is, it's not going to totally strip all of our jurisdiction.

371
00:23:22,911 --> 00:23:25,172
You know, it's just in that niche, um,

372
00:23:26,548 --> 00:23:35,950
project as we're looking at them, this would tear off the backside of a house or again, take down a carriage house in order to build new housing.

373
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:36,430
So.

374
00:23:39,031 --> 00:23:47,172
I think the concern would be that it, I think somewhere in that language, it says like substantially like slowing it down.

375
00:23:47,232 --> 00:23:54,674
So like we wouldn't be, I don't think anyone wanted to stop the addition, the making of an AU, but like,

376
00:23:55,265 --> 00:24:03,309
it should be done, you know, through the process of, you know, accepting a project, right, you know, and keeping it historically.

377
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:24,181
So, I guess, is, is this some like, so, you know, we have two different historic commissions, you know, so, you know, I think that my opinion would be that we would write a letter ourselves and then have the other historic

378
00:24:24,988 --> 00:24:27,929
you know, the other historic district could do an independent letter themselves.

379
00:24:27,949 --> 00:24:30,471
So two different letters would go out.

380
00:24:31,531 --> 00:24:41,596
So I think, you know, are people amenable to us drafting a letter and sending it to the legislators that would be voting on this?

381
00:24:43,016 --> 00:24:47,378
You know, voicing our concern is that, would people be amenable to that?

382
00:24:48,719 --> 00:24:48,939
Yes.

383
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:50,440
Okay.

384
00:24:50,907 --> 00:24:51,527
Yeah, I haven't.

385
00:24:51,588 --> 00:24:55,931
Okay, yeah, we would have you guys review it before it gets sent off.

386
00:24:55,971 --> 00:24:59,413
So, you know, you wouldn't be co signing on something blindly.

387
00:24:59,453 --> 00:25:00,674
You would be able to review it.

388
00:25:01,074 --> 00:25:06,999
Okay, but we need to vote on this and we can just start drafting a letter and then.

389
00:25:07,019 --> 00:25:08,680
Yeah, yeah, there wasn't really an action.

390
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:12,623
This is more just a review, but we'll draft the letter.

391
00:25:12,643 --> 00:25:18,207
I think whenever our next meeting, we bring that letter to the next meeting, then we can perfect.

392
00:25:19,258 --> 00:25:32,627
So some of the things that I thought to include in the letter would be one that so the we'll have to get the exact date, but the historic districts was started in in 1960.

393
00:25:33,487 --> 00:25:35,889
And I think that it should be said that.

394
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:44,935
The majority like that's a 1960 obviously is, you know, quite quite a few years ago in the houses.

395
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:50,171
probably the majority of the houses have changed ownership in that time period.

396
00:25:50,271 --> 00:25:56,274
And people bought these homes, you know, knowing that they're in a community that's protected.

397
00:25:56,374 --> 00:26:09,581
And there's got to be a better way to say this, you know, like, yeah, you know, we'll have to work on the wording, but like, people bought into this, you know, knowing it would be knowing it'd be a preserved right.

398
00:26:09,661 --> 00:26:12,302
And then it's all getting swiped with like, really,

399
00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:18,487
you know, quick, like, you know, so that would be one thing that the line would... Well, if they have known that, I have a super question.

400
00:26:18,888 --> 00:26:21,109
How would they have known they're buying something, you know?

401
00:26:21,589 --> 00:26:24,490
Well, that would have to be disclosed, so when you're buying... Buy the real tech?

402
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:26,451
Yeah, that would be something to be disclosed.

403
00:26:26,471 --> 00:26:27,031
Oh, okay.

404
00:26:27,051 --> 00:26:27,271
All right.

405
00:26:27,291 --> 00:26:35,695
If I were to sell it, well, it would be the seller's obligation to disclose that to the real estate broker, who would then disclose that to the purchaser.

406
00:26:36,696 --> 00:26:37,336
So they would know.

407
00:26:39,077 --> 00:26:40,758
In the second, the...

408
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:49,386
One other thing that we should include in that letter is that we recently added a district.

409
00:26:49,406 --> 00:26:52,409
That's a good percentage of the homes.

410
00:26:52,489 --> 00:26:58,073
And that was well supported by the people in the South Street District.

411
00:26:58,133 --> 00:27:04,038
So then once again, that's just getting swiped away quickly in a couple sentences.

412
00:27:06,982 --> 00:27:13,483
I think that those two things should be somehow wordsmithed into this letter.

413
00:27:13,744 --> 00:27:19,965
So I thought it might be nice if we went around and anyone else had some ideas of what to add to the letter.

414
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:25,486
And then if anyone wants to take on writing the letter, that's fine.

415
00:27:25,546 --> 00:27:28,187
I have no problem passing that off to someone.

416
00:27:28,227 --> 00:27:29,967
And if not, I'll write the letter.

417
00:27:30,027 --> 00:27:33,408
And you, Teresa, will make sense of that.

418
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:39,253
of my thoughts and put it in, you know, put it into something that someone will read and not put in the circular file.

419
00:27:41,095 --> 00:27:49,980
And I will also share, uh, boards and commissions often will write letters of support or letters of concern for various bills.

420
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,942
So this isn't a weird thing.

421
00:27:53,002 --> 00:27:57,725
You know, this is something that is pretty standard, um, as we come across, you know,

422
00:27:59,569 --> 00:28:07,054
I don't want to say problematic bills, but bills that could end up being problematic, because I think the intention of this bill is all great.

423
00:28:07,474 --> 00:28:08,414
Housing is needed.

424
00:28:08,514 --> 00:28:11,576
We need to do something about increasing our housing stock, certainly.

425
00:28:12,317 --> 00:28:18,240
But does it need to be at the expense of our historical assets?

426
00:28:18,821 --> 00:28:29,147
We might want to state in this letter, too, that we just met a month or two ago, and we're already working on... There's already an ADU going into

427
00:28:29,775 --> 00:28:32,877
the Marm Simmons community into a carriage.

428
00:28:32,937 --> 00:28:34,198
I was like, perfectly right.

429
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:39,342
What an awesome use of that space, you know, like, without changing the facade of the building.

430
00:28:39,362 --> 00:28:40,363
Yeah, there's no reason.

431
00:28:40,403 --> 00:28:45,967
There's no reason to like, there's no reason to demolish and make a smooth makeup.

432
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:48,229
Makeup.

433
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:51,952
There's no reason to change the way it's currently set up.

434
00:28:51,972 --> 00:28:52,192
Right.

435
00:28:52,452 --> 00:28:52,733
Right.

436
00:28:53,733 --> 00:28:54,034
Yeah.

437
00:28:54,094 --> 00:28:55,675
The other thing is, is that taking these

438
00:28:56,492 --> 00:29:10,840
taking these assets that we have, not just individual houses, but also the fabric of part of the city that's been preserved, that has lasted as long as it has, and then to knock down a carriage house, it's like, what did you actually gain by that?

439
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:16,283
I mean, you maybe gained one unit, maybe two units.

440
00:29:17,064 --> 00:29:24,688
It's not, it's, I mean, no, it is an urban renewal where you're blowing out whole sections of the city or something, but it's like, is it really worth

441
00:29:25,803 --> 00:29:30,746
damaging that fabric and damaging those buildings for so little.

442
00:29:33,328 --> 00:29:43,514
I'd almost say it's like, well, OK, if you took this house down but got 30 units out of it, OK, maybe, but you'd still have to argue with me.

443
00:29:43,974 --> 00:29:53,260
But not if it means, OK, you're just going to go around and just start blowing out what makes these areas what they are and worth protecting.

444
00:29:57,316 --> 00:29:58,798
I don't like the wording of that thing at all.

445
00:29:59,739 --> 00:30:01,201
That's kind of stupid.

446
00:30:02,202 --> 00:30:06,387
And the concern that I had as well on this is it's not clear.

447
00:30:07,949 --> 00:30:14,676
So where is, so what the 1900 date of this, so when you read through it.

448
00:30:16,924 --> 00:30:20,365
constructed after January 1, 1990.

449
00:30:21,865 --> 00:30:26,127
So is that the structure on the property or is that the overall?

450
00:30:26,147 --> 00:30:32,789
Because these houses, they may have been constructed one-time additions.

451
00:30:32,869 --> 00:30:35,369
Are we just going to take someone's word, all of that?

452
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:40,671
garage was built after this period.

453
00:30:40,691 --> 00:30:40,671
1901.

454
00:30:40,771 --> 00:30:42,912
All of a sudden, everything's built in 1901.

455
00:30:43,152 --> 00:30:46,593
Because the records don't go back for all these different things.

456
00:30:46,693 --> 00:30:52,335
And that's going to really cause an issue with that.

457
00:30:52,675 --> 00:30:56,637
And it really should be protected because it's in a district.

458
00:30:57,157 --> 00:31:04,479
We have a better, I think ours is a better standing than even the other commission because ours is already protected as a district.

459
00:31:07,715 --> 00:31:15,480
Is that something we could add into the letter to like, it's going to be difficult to age that structure in the district.

460
00:31:18,361 --> 00:31:19,322
And burdensome.

461
00:31:20,543 --> 00:31:22,604
Yeah, and very costly.

462
00:31:22,644 --> 00:31:27,267
Because, to your point, the structure could have gone up in 1860, but the carriage house

463
00:31:28,503 --> 00:31:29,383
When was that?

464
00:31:29,423 --> 00:31:33,245
When were they going to say, oh, we're going to rip the back off?

465
00:31:33,445 --> 00:31:41,369
You know, and it's, you know, these have, you know, you've got a beautiful old house and they put an addition to the back that was like part of the kitchen or something, you know, like all of a sudden that's going to get ripped off.

466
00:31:41,409 --> 00:31:49,933
And then, yeah, that was built in the, you know, I mean, some of them might be obvious when it was built, but I mean, that's going to be really burdensome to figure out when that was done.

467
00:31:49,973 --> 00:31:51,914
And, and, you know, uh,

468
00:31:52,862 --> 00:32:03,827
As we're having this conversation, a lot of the time with the Historic Gold Commission will do as they're reviewing, as I mentioned earlier, the demo delays, is they hire a consultant to do like a form B, it's called.

469
00:32:03,927 --> 00:32:11,410
It's basically a historical report of that property, like how it came to be, like the architectural design.

470
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:12,450
It's pretty comprehensive.

471
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:16,412
There's probably one for your house, Ann Marie, out there.

472
00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:19,493
That costs money and that takes time too.

473
00:32:19,593 --> 00:32:26,365
So like, is it now that as every one of these projects comes forth, we have to go and order a Form B so that we can?

474
00:32:26,958 --> 00:32:28,859
ascertain when the structure was built.

475
00:32:28,959 --> 00:32:30,580
And then what was the point of having the money?

476
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,421
And then what was the point of having the district?

477
00:32:32,461 --> 00:32:38,424
The people have already they've already bought into the homes over all these years since the 1960s that they purchased these homes.

478
00:32:38,945 --> 00:32:46,188
And these people that have signed on to this and all excited about it and very happy at the at the voting that happened last year.

479
00:32:46,208 --> 00:32:47,129
You know, like it's.

480
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:49,750
Yeah.

481
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:52,372
Like I said, the intention of the bill is great.

482
00:32:52,392 --> 00:32:56,254
I just some some word choices in there.

483
00:32:56,852 --> 00:32:58,573
have some pretty big consequences here.

484
00:32:58,933 --> 00:33:10,897
And again, we're not talking about it affecting a lot of properties here in Medford, but, you know- It potentially could, because the wording is not well written in this, because it's the structure.

485
00:33:10,917 --> 00:33:21,060
So is it the, so at the very least, they're going to have to talk about when the structure, you know, is it a structure added to a structure?

486
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:26,602
Which part of it, like if 90% of the home was built in, you know,

487
00:33:27,403 --> 00:33:32,745
pre-1900, what's the percentage?

488
00:33:32,805 --> 00:33:34,566
This isn't well thought out or well written.

489
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:42,389
I think that a good letter like this actually would have the districts then separated out and protected from this.

490
00:33:43,109 --> 00:33:45,350
Because it's going to be way too confusing and hard to do.

491
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:45,971
Right.

492
00:33:49,792 --> 00:33:53,054
Any additional thoughts that we'd want to have captured in the letter?

493
00:33:53,074 --> 00:33:56,395
Or do we think we encompassed everything?

494
00:33:59,307 --> 00:34:01,828
Does anybody have objections to sending a letter?

495
00:34:02,929 --> 00:34:04,490
No, I think it needs to be done.

496
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:08,192
I'm sorry, go ahead, James.

497
00:34:08,572 --> 00:34:15,696
I was going to say, I think what we've talked about is a good number of things to at least get the draft started.

498
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:20,019
Perfect.

499
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:24,121
And then as we read through it, we can say, OK, let's tweak this or let's add something.

500
00:34:24,441 --> 00:34:27,543
Because I'm sure once we have something in front of us,

501
00:34:29,216 --> 00:34:32,077
to look at, that can be massaged and added to.

502
00:34:32,097 --> 00:34:33,058
Right.

503
00:34:33,198 --> 00:34:33,578
Perfect.

504
00:34:33,618 --> 00:34:35,378
Does anyone want to take this on?

505
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:38,880
Do you mind if Teresa and I work on it?

506
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:40,801
Is that OK?

507
00:34:40,941 --> 00:34:42,001
What's everyone's thought on that?

508
00:34:42,021 --> 00:34:44,942
Does anybody have a burning desire to write this letter?

509
00:34:46,743 --> 00:34:53,206
I think you probably have a good handle on what this is about, and I'd like to see it come from you.

510
00:34:53,926 --> 00:34:56,907
And if we have any questions, we certainly can get back to you.

511
00:34:56,947 --> 00:34:58,648
You're there for us.

512
00:34:59,433 --> 00:34:59,653
Yeah.

513
00:34:59,913 --> 00:35:00,194
Okay.

514
00:35:00,234 --> 00:35:00,534
That works.

515
00:35:00,554 --> 00:35:01,015
So it's good.

516
00:35:01,615 --> 00:35:02,056
I'll take that.

517
00:35:02,196 --> 00:35:03,157
I'll take a first stab at it.

518
00:35:03,237 --> 00:35:03,437
Okay.

519
00:35:03,677 --> 00:35:05,018
I'll kick it over to you.

520
00:35:05,579 --> 00:35:05,859
Great.

521
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,321
Do we need to vote on this?

522
00:35:08,322 --> 00:35:12,666
We're just starting with something.

523
00:35:12,686 --> 00:35:15,989
So yeah, I'll just vote at the time of the letter.

524
00:35:16,009 --> 00:35:19,332
So this is just a discussion.

525
00:35:19,693 --> 00:35:19,973
Yeah.

526
00:35:21,495 --> 00:35:21,975
All right.

527
00:35:22,636 --> 00:35:22,836
Great.

528
00:35:22,856 --> 00:35:23,857
Well, I think that's, um,

529
00:35:25,508 --> 00:35:28,630
Yeah, the minutes were the only other thing, and I apologize.

530
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:29,871
I will get those for next time.

531
00:35:31,932 --> 00:35:32,272
All right.

532
00:35:32,332 --> 00:35:35,254
Well, that's it for this meeting.

533
00:35:35,294 --> 00:35:41,358
If we want to get a motion to end it, then someone second it, we can wrap it up.

534
00:35:41,758 --> 00:35:43,239
Anybody want a motion to adjourn?

535
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,200
Motion to adjourn.

536
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:48,582
Do we have a second?

537
00:35:49,623 --> 00:35:49,923
All right.

538
00:35:49,943 --> 00:35:50,764
Let's take a vote.

539
00:35:51,724 --> 00:35:52,085
Adjourned.

540
00:35:52,165 --> 00:35:52,465
Emery?

541
00:35:52,965 --> 00:35:53,265
James?

542
00:35:53,866 --> 00:35:54,046
Yes.

543
00:35:55,325 --> 00:35:55,686
Charlotte?

544
00:35:55,726 --> 00:35:55,986
Yeah.

545
00:35:56,346 --> 00:35:56,627
Yes.

546
00:35:57,668 --> 00:35:58,529
And I vote yes too.

547
00:35:58,569 --> 00:35:59,930
So we're wrapping it up.

548
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:00,991
We'll see you guys next month.

549
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:01,492
Awesome.

550
00:36:01,552 --> 00:36:02,453
Thank you all so much.

551
00:36:03,014 --> 00:36:03,474
Thank you.

552
00:36:03,955 --> 00:36:04,375
Take care.

553
00:36:04,515 --> 00:36:04,816
Bye.

554
00:36:05,176 --> 00:36:05,376
Bye.

555
00:36:05,577 --> 00:36:06,337
Thank you so much.
