I saw that you just arrived.

00:00:17,756 --> 00:00:18,316
It's on the Zoom.

13
00:00:18,376 --> 00:00:22,119
I just, I haven't, I didn't have a voice yet.

14
00:00:22,139 --> 00:00:22,699
President Morrell.

15
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:23,360
Present.

16
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:25,441
So we're going with seven present.

17

The meeting is called to order.

21
00:00:29,324 --> 00:00:30,085
Can you mute your computer?

22
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:34,336
There you go.

23
00:00:34,356 --> 00:00:35,337
Please rise to salute the flag.

24
00:00:36,519 --> 00:00:41,964
Announcements, accolades, remembrances, reports, and records 22-587 offered by Councillor Scarpelli.

25
00:00:42,004 --> 00:00:43,745
Be it so resolved that the... Sorry.

26
00:01:08,246 --> 00:01:09,226
Just okay, good.

27
00:01:11,767 --> 00:01:13,248
Yeah, I think.

28
00:01:13,928 --> 00:01:14,508
Okay, thank you.

29
00:01:15,729 --> 00:01:23,531
Be it so resolved that the Medford City Council invite the Medford High School head football coach and the players to the next city council meeting in recognition of their outstanding community outreach.

30
00:01:23,911 --> 00:01:24,551
Councilor Scarpelli.

31
00:01:26,232 --> 00:01:27,593
You wanna come up?

32
00:01:27,613 --> 00:01:27,793
Sure.

33
00:01:54,987 --> 00:01:55,927
Thank you, Madam President.

34
00:01:56,808 --> 00:01:58,388
Um, it's my privilege tonight.

35
00:01:58,428 --> 00:02:13,954
I know we've had, um, we've had a tough week here in Medford, and, um, this is fitting and needed, uh, to address a group of young people that have done our city proud.

36
00:02:14,774 --> 00:02:22,416
Um, and before I recognize anyone, if Coach Curley and coach offered, come on up.

37
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:42,221
I just called them up just because next to coach Curly, I looked like a supermodel.

38
00:02:42,261 --> 00:02:45,944
So I wanted to make sure he was next to me.

39
00:02:45,964 --> 00:02:59,654
But you guys, I wanted to really put a resolution through a few weeks back to acknowledge what the Method Mustang football team has done and their coaching staff.

40
00:03:00,575 --> 00:03:02,756
Something that's always overlooked

41
00:03:04,382 --> 00:03:07,463
is the impact that young people play in our community.

42
00:03:08,263 --> 00:03:10,184
And it's easy when it's something bad, right?

43
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:14,085
When it's something bad, everybody wants to talk about what the kids are doing wrong.

44
00:03:15,085 --> 00:03:25,568
But I wanted to make sure that as I look through different messages that I received, I was noticing a trend.

45
00:03:26,528 --> 00:03:27,849
I was noticing an amazing trend.

46
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,572
that our football team is a special, special group of people.

47
00:03:36,813 --> 00:03:38,654
I coached at Medford High School for many years.

48
00:03:39,795 --> 00:03:43,376
I was lucky to be part of a great organization and a great team.

49
00:03:44,417 --> 00:03:49,400
And one thing I realized, it's very important to have Mustang pride.

50
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,122
And I think that's what we're lacking right now in the city, true Mustang pride.

51
00:03:54,422 --> 00:03:59,265
And when coach Curley came, came to the program and before that,

52
00:04:00,061 --> 00:04:00,982
We had some difficulties.

53
00:04:01,322 --> 00:04:02,063
Numbers were low.

54
00:04:02,823 --> 00:04:03,764
Kids were getting in trouble.

55
00:04:04,565 --> 00:04:06,006
You know, we weren't winning games.

56
00:04:06,906 --> 00:04:08,608
Everybody thought that the world was ending.

57
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:11,090
And then you saw the bigger picture.

58
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:12,851
Coach Curley came in.

59
00:04:13,932 --> 00:04:15,393
You saw him active in the community.

60
00:04:16,934 --> 00:04:19,957
You saw him doing special things with his team.

61
00:04:20,817 --> 00:04:24,140
And all of a sudden the football team started becoming, became elevated.

62
00:04:25,961 --> 00:04:27,643
And now the numbers have grown.

63
00:04:29,151 --> 00:04:31,552
and positive things are in front of us.

64
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:34,634
It's all right.

65
00:04:35,034 --> 00:04:37,155
That's my favorite song, by the way.

66
00:04:37,515 --> 00:04:37,915
It's okay.

67
00:04:37,935 --> 00:04:41,837
So now, what I wanted to address is something very important.

68
00:04:44,438 --> 00:04:45,239
What is a Mustang?

69
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,360
It's not a word.

70
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,182
I know people, it's easy to say Mustang pride.

71
00:04:52,782 --> 00:04:57,885
What it means to be a Mustang is truly to love the city you live in, to represent

72
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,721
your community with pride and distinction.

73
00:05:01,481 --> 00:05:04,862
And what you boys and girls have done have been amazing.

74
00:05:10,645 --> 00:05:13,546
One thing I will say is that we have Coach Curley as your leader.

75
00:05:14,446 --> 00:05:16,467
And that's the key, having a leader you can lean on.

76
00:05:17,528 --> 00:05:23,470
A person that wants to be involved in a young person's life, no matter what the circumstance.

77
00:05:25,317 --> 00:05:35,044
And it's easy to say when things aren't going well and teams aren't winning and you're losing, it's easy to say, well, they're no good, let's get rid of the coach and let's start all over again.

78
00:05:36,325 --> 00:05:40,268
What I find so impressive and I want you to understand, this isn't about winning and losing.

79
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:47,153
You went to Fenway Park and you represented Medford with a lot of respect and pride.

80
00:05:49,955 --> 00:05:53,698
Why I put this resolution through is for what you're doing off the field.

81
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:58,384
A few things that this football team has done.

82
00:05:59,784 --> 00:06:04,986
You've helped organize the national night out with the whole football team and the police department.

83
00:06:06,147 --> 00:06:09,528
Really showing what unity means and how everybody works together.

84
00:06:10,108 --> 00:06:10,749
You led that.

85
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:16,971
In September, you helped empty out the senior citizens' basements and helped seniors.

86
00:06:18,112 --> 00:06:21,273
In October, you helped with the Unified Basketball League.

87
00:06:23,173 --> 00:06:24,334
The day before Thanksgiving,

88
00:06:25,307 --> 00:06:31,190
Before Thanksgiving game, we saw you guys over at McDonald Stadium helping with the unified flag football game.

89
00:06:33,451 --> 00:06:39,394
Then you saw a bunch of football players in yards raking out people's yards that couldn't do it themselves.

90
00:06:40,655 --> 00:06:44,797
And now you're helping with the Meffitt Family Network for their toy drive.

91
00:06:46,998 --> 00:06:47,698
That's amazing.

92
00:06:50,012 --> 00:07:03,399
And I wanted to have this opportunity tonight to bring Coach Curley up and really commend you for what you have done and really put you on the pedestal that you deserve to be put on.

93
00:07:06,881 --> 00:07:09,283
One thing is having the leader to show you the way.

94
00:07:10,223 --> 00:07:14,866
And it's an honor that I talked about John Curley tonight because John's a very special person.

95
00:07:15,846 --> 00:07:18,868
What I'd love to hear is I got a phone call from a teacher

96
00:07:19,631 --> 00:07:21,572
And they said, George, I saw this resolution.

97
00:07:21,592 --> 00:07:22,733
I need to share something with you.

98
00:07:23,973 --> 00:07:25,814
I had a problem with the football player.

99
00:07:25,854 --> 00:07:26,715
He was being a little wise.

100
00:07:28,036 --> 00:07:29,196
And I called Coach Curley.

101
00:07:31,177 --> 00:07:36,560
And the next day, Coach Curley was sitting in the back of the room, just his presence there.

102
00:07:38,561 --> 00:07:42,503
And what we realized is that young man wasn't offended.

103
00:07:43,804 --> 00:07:47,226
He was so taken back that Coach Curley was there to do what?

104
00:07:48,026 --> 00:07:48,947
To show him he cares.

105
00:07:49,871 --> 00:07:51,512
to make sure that he's doing the right thing.

106
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:55,394
And that's the type of leadership we need in our school system.

107
00:07:55,954 --> 00:08:01,617
And what you boys have done and girls have done and gone out to the community and put together all of these community service hours.

108
00:08:01,998 --> 00:08:04,439
It's something we should as a city applaud.

109
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,361
So I want to publicly thank you guys.

110
00:08:08,901 --> 00:08:13,524
I want we I know we put together a do we do we have that

111
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:22,681
accommodation.

112
00:08:22,701 --> 00:08:34,226
Thank you.

113
00:08:34,246 --> 00:08:49,513
Okay, so we have accommodations that we put together the method Mustang City Council, the method City Council award the this combination to and we'll say the young man's name a young lady's name and recognition of your outstanding 2022 season.

114
00:08:50,823 --> 00:08:54,246
with the Meffitt High School football team and your commitment to community service.

115
00:08:54,706 --> 00:08:56,328
Congratulations on your accomplishments.

116
00:08:56,348 --> 00:08:57,128
Go Mustangs.

117
00:08:57,989 --> 00:08:59,931
If we can, I'd love just to recognize you.

118
00:08:59,951 --> 00:09:01,172
We're going to call your name up.

119
00:09:01,232 --> 00:09:03,974
I know that Coach Curley, Coach Offer are going to help out.

120
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:10,920
If we can, just before we get going, if Coach Curley has anything to say, I know that before we get going, I know we want to

121
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,328
I know some of the boys and girls want to get in and out.

122
00:09:13,388 --> 00:09:16,209
So I know that, Coach, if you have anything to say, that'd be great.

123
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:22,472
I just want to say thank you for allowing us to show what community really is all about.

124
00:09:24,573 --> 00:09:27,335
These kids are not told to do this stuff.

125
00:09:27,395 --> 00:09:28,515
They actually want to do it.

126
00:09:28,595 --> 00:09:29,116
It's awesome.

127
00:09:29,976 --> 00:09:36,479
Just like the leaf cleanup we did, I would go to one house, and all of a sudden, I would see six kids cleaning.

128
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:39,200
Then I'd go to another house, and all of a sudden, I'd see like four kids cleaning.

129
00:09:39,241 --> 00:09:39,861
There's 10 kids at the house,

130
00:09:40,892 --> 00:09:44,033
other six are on the other side of the house just grouping each other together.

131
00:09:44,193 --> 00:09:50,076
And then the beautiful thing about our football team and our program is that we have parents involved.

132
00:09:50,336 --> 00:10:02,701
Like you have parents right there here tonight that are really, really involved by like cooking meals, helping us before games, after games, taking care of stuff that we don't know about, other kids that we don't know about.

133
00:10:02,741 --> 00:10:07,003
So it's a real big family aspect and that's, I'm very honored.

134
00:10:08,077 --> 00:10:13,759
This is very, um, it's a really good moment for the community, not just the football team, but the community itself.

135
00:10:14,359 --> 00:10:15,740
I really do appreciate this.

136
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,380
Thank you very much.

137
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:27,803
I don't want to figure one person.

138
00:10:27,843 --> 00:10:29,504
I know that Mr. Mr. Medford's here.

139
00:10:30,264 --> 00:10:34,646
Uh, Mr. Chris Murphy, thank you for everything you do with the football association.

140
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:34,706
Um,

141
00:10:36,477 --> 00:10:37,497
We really appreciate it.

142
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:38,758
You look fabulous by the way.

143
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:39,698
So thank you.

144
00:10:40,298 --> 00:10:41,118
All right, coach, you ready?

145
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:42,259

Coach, I know that we have a bunch of coaches that have been committed.

196
00:15:42,794 --> 00:15:45,275
I know that they've been great with the program.

197
00:15:45,315 --> 00:15:46,215
If you could just acknowledge them.

198
00:15:46,275 --> 00:15:50,357
I know, Coach Offit, you're a right-hand man, but anyone else that you need to address, that'd be great.

199
00:15:50,377 --> 00:15:51,838
We've got Coach Bederos.

200
00:15:52,638 --> 00:15:53,258
Thank you, Coach.

201
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:56,460
Coach AJ.

202
00:15:59,601 --> 00:16:02,422
And Coach Joe Rowe is not here right now, but

203
00:16:03,225 --> 00:16:05,707
He's on his way, hopefully coming up a little bit.

204
00:16:07,108 --> 00:16:11,812
So you know when you're a true method program, when coach Joe's leading you boys.

205
00:16:11,872 --> 00:16:14,454
So I think that I appreciate coach for being here.

206
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:17,096
I know he's at an appointment, but he's gonna try to make it.

207
00:16:17,716 --> 00:16:20,258
If not, I'll come by the house myself and drop off his.

208
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:27,624
So what we did is we put together a certificate that's gonna be in a folder.

209
00:16:27,644 --> 00:16:29,486
We're gonna be getting that out to you tomorrow, okay?

210
00:16:29,946 --> 00:16:31,547
But I thank you guys for coming out tonight.

211
00:16:32,755 --> 00:16:33,535

212
00:16:33,655 --> 00:16:35,376

Coach Calvin.

214
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:38,677
Thank you, Coach.

215
00:16:41,978 --> 00:16:48,760
Again, it's easy to point things out when a young person does something wrong.

216
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,200
It seems like that's an easy thing to do.

217
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,982
What I'm proud of tonight is that we're really putting you on a pedestal because you deserve it.

218
00:16:57,158 --> 00:17:07,770
The opportunity that the time that you give on your own, like coach said that when we talked and said that no one forces you to do anything, but you go out and do it because you love the city of Medford.

219
00:17:08,331 --> 00:17:09,853
This is what true community is all about.

220
00:17:10,273 --> 00:17:11,014
So I'm proud of you.

221
00:17:11,034 --> 00:17:11,795
I thank you.

222
00:17:12,015 --> 00:17:14,718
My fellow counselors, thank you and have a great night.

223
00:17:14,738 --> 00:17:15,699

224
00:17:15,719 --> 00:17:16,040
Thank you.

225
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,050
Hold on to the back.

226
00:18:25,677 --> 00:18:25,997
I know.

227
00:20:50,637 --> 00:20:51,057
Thank you, sir.

228
00:21:29,873 --> 00:21:33,054
I hope so.

Could you give us a brief summary of the petition before us?

Yeah, so we are requesting permission to install a groundwater monitoring well.

286
00:25:36,425 --> 00:25:40,609
adjacent to the sidewalk along the east side of commercial street.

287
00:25:41,549 --> 00:25:54,279
The purpose of the well is to allow the General Electric Company to continue to monitor groundwater conditions downgrading of their property at 3960 Mystic Valley Parkway.

288
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:59,883
They've been doing investigation and cleanup work there for a number of years.

289
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:03,161
under the Massachusetts contingency plan.

290
00:26:03,362 --> 00:26:08,827
And this well is just part of their ongoing obligations under the MCP.

291
00:26:11,229 --> 00:26:11,589
Thank you.

292
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:14,932
Before I open up the public hearing, do we have questions from counselors?

293
00:26:16,293 --> 00:26:18,075
Madam President, if I can.

294
00:26:18,836 --> 00:26:22,439
Is the anybody representing the city to answer any questions on this call?

295
00:26:34,382 --> 00:26:42,244
I see a summary from Owen as well.

296
00:26:44,005 --> 00:26:47,586
This is the first time we've received this type of request.

297
00:26:48,726 --> 00:26:50,907
Tell us a little bit about this project from the city point of view.

298
00:26:51,647 --> 00:27:01,110
From the city point of view, it's basically trying to it's just a monitoring well, it's a small two foot

299
00:27:02,693 --> 00:27:05,274
well that's located on city property.

300
00:27:05,294 --> 00:27:12,939
All right, so structurally, it's not unsafe or it's not going to jeopardize the area around the well.

301
00:27:13,019 --> 00:27:17,121
It's not, it's pretty.

302
00:27:17,881 --> 00:27:18,282
Correct.

303
00:27:18,702 --> 00:27:20,183
And you're recommending this zone.

304
00:27:20,223 --> 00:27:21,703
Is this something you recommend?

305
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:22,524
Yes.

306
00:27:22,944 --> 00:27:25,425
Okay, thank you.

307
00:27:25,866 --> 00:27:28,247
I think I took no exceptions in how I phrased it.

308
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,701
Any other questions for the council?

309
00:27:36,043 --> 00:27:39,805
Oh, and is this monitoring water quality or water table?

310
00:27:41,766 --> 00:27:43,587
Water quality, I believe.

311
00:27:44,587 --> 00:27:45,068
Okay.

312
00:27:45,148 --> 00:27:46,308
It would actually be both.

313
00:27:47,309 --> 00:27:49,710
It's both, okay, water levels and water quality, okay.

314
00:27:50,931 --> 00:27:51,131
Yes.

315
00:27:51,191 --> 00:27:52,672
Any others from the council at this time?

316
00:27:55,149 --> 00:27:57,510
As this is a public hearing, I do need to open the public hearing.

317
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:04,133
So if there's anyone who would like to speak in favor of the petition, this public hearing is open and please raise your hand to speak now.

318
00:28:04,213 --> 00:28:05,393

Yes.

321
00:28:13,276 --> 00:28:13,816
You can say yes.

322
00:28:14,016 --> 00:28:15,757
It's just protocol.

323
00:28:16,957 --> 00:28:17,198
Yes.

324
00:28:18,218 --> 00:28:18,518
Thank you.

325
00:28:18,938 --> 00:28:20,859
Is there anyone else who would like to speak in favor of this petition?

326
00:28:24,807 --> 00:28:27,709
Seeing none, this portion of the hearing is closed.

327
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:31,172
Is there anyone who would like to speak against this petition?

328
00:28:35,676 --> 00:28:38,098
Seeing none, this portion of the hearing is closed.

329
00:28:38,358 --> 00:28:39,659
Do I have a motion from the council?

330
00:28:41,781 --> 00:28:45,685
On the motion of Councilor Knight to approve, seconded by Councilor Faviello.

331
00:28:45,705 --> 00:28:47,966

Everything seems in order, sirs.

346
00:29:49,776 --> 00:29:53,739
This is what type of, if you could just give us just a brief synopsis to share with everybody.

347
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:54,940
Sure.

348
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,582
So it's a bubble tea shop that we are opening.

349
00:29:59,863 --> 00:30:02,905
So it's a flavor bubble tea from Taiwan.

350
00:30:03,205 --> 00:30:09,509
It's very popular at the moment, and it's including fruit tea, milk tea, smoothie.

351
00:30:10,365 --> 00:30:13,486
and also comes with the flavor boba that you could add inside.

352
00:30:13,926 --> 00:30:14,186
Okay.

353
00:30:14,486 --> 00:30:15,646
Yeah, that's all right.

354
00:30:15,686 --> 00:30:15,886
Great.

355
00:30:16,246 --> 00:30:19,347
And what are the hours of operation over Saturday hours of operations?

356
00:30:19,387 --> 00:30:19,747
What time?

357
00:30:20,447 --> 00:30:21,007
What days?

358
00:30:21,067 --> 00:30:27,928
It's from 12 to nine from Monday through Friday, Monday through Saturday, Sunday from 12 to seven.

359
00:30:28,188 --> 00:30:28,468
Okay.

360
00:30:28,708 --> 00:30:32,829
Yeah, because I was falling to play and then how many employees do you have?

361
00:30:32,869 --> 00:30:33,649
Just me and my wife.

362
00:30:33,889 --> 00:30:34,949
That's it.

363
00:30:35,049 --> 00:30:36,289
Okay.

364
00:30:37,009 --> 00:30:39,530
And I hear great things about this this product and

365
00:30:40,385 --> 00:30:42,167
We're excited that you're moving to Meffitt Square.

366
00:30:42,227 --> 00:30:43,188
It's a great location.

367
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:46,552
I know that my daughter loves it.

368
00:30:46,572 --> 00:30:50,035
So it's going to be, it's going to be something we'll see in our family.

369
00:30:50,075 --> 00:30:57,303
So again, I see everything in order, Madam President, I would move approval after questions from my fellow counselors, if they have any.

370
00:31:01,238 --> 00:31:03,160
Um, I just wanted to wish you the best of luck.

371
00:31:03,681 --> 00:31:13,350
Um, my friends and I have always wanted a bubble tea shop in Medford and it's, um, it's a, it's a great honor for us to be able to have one to call our own.

372
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:14,611
So thank you so much.

373
00:31:15,512 --> 00:31:15,752
Thank you.

374
00:31:20,432 --> 00:31:20,692
Thank you.

375
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:21,892
And I also want to wish you good luck.

376
00:31:21,952 --> 00:31:27,214
I just know at my work, I work at university and they say, if you want the students to come anywhere, offer them boba tea.

377
00:31:27,274 --> 00:31:29,094
So I hope you have great success.

378
00:31:30,334 --> 00:31:33,215
Motion of Councilor Knight to approve, seconded by Councilor Carviello.

379
00:31:33,275 --> 00:31:34,495
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

380
00:31:40,537 --> 00:31:40,677
Yes.

381
00:31:40,717 --> 00:31:40,817
Yes.

382
00:31:40,837 --> 00:31:40,917
Yes.

383
00:31:40,957 --> 00:31:41,197
Yes.

384
00:31:41,237 --> 00:31:41,457
Yes.

385
00:31:51,094 --> 00:31:53,415
Yes, I mean the affirmative is zero and the negative, the motion passes.

386
00:31:53,655 --> 00:31:54,355
Congratulations.

387
00:31:54,455 --> 00:31:55,056
Thank you.

388
00:32:00,758 --> 00:32:02,019
So going to 22-603.

389
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:10,962
22-603 offered by Vice President Behrs.

390
00:32:11,042 --> 00:32:19,706
Be it so resolved by the Medford City Council that the Prevention Outreach Manager present an update on the Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness Project and Grant.

391
00:32:25,747 --> 00:32:37,896
Thank you, everybody for having me here tonight.

392
00:32:37,916 --> 00:32:37,956
Um.

393
00:32:43,019 --> 00:32:43,660
We have your name in it.

394
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,302
We know your name and address, but if you could just introduce yourself to just forget about

395
00:32:56,890 --> 00:32:57,170
we go.

396
00:33:04,915 --> 00:33:06,737
Thank you so much for having me here tonight.

397
00:33:06,757 --> 00:33:16,123
So I'm here to speak specifically about a program that we have to grant that we've applied for.

398
00:33:17,124 --> 00:33:22,507
And I want to first just get everybody grounded in what is the Office of Prevention and Outreach.

399
00:33:22,527 --> 00:33:24,228
The Office of Prevention and Outreach was established in 2015.

400
00:33:24,409 --> 00:33:26,510
Thank you to the City Council for

401
00:33:27,099 --> 00:33:30,181
moving that forward to address the opioid crisis.

402
00:33:31,162 --> 00:33:33,443
At that time, they funded my position.

403
00:33:33,924 --> 00:33:40,708
In 2017, the city council and the mayor has funded a city recovery coach position as well.

404
00:33:42,189 --> 00:33:45,431
In 2018, we established our Medford hub meeting.

405
00:33:45,491 --> 00:33:55,478
It's a crisis specific group meeting with multiple service providers to help people at the highest risk get out of risk.

406
00:33:55,922 --> 00:33:59,704
So I want to just point that out, but these are some of the things that we've had going on.

407
00:34:00,524 --> 00:34:06,227
In 2020, though, we were reassigned to work on the COVID-19 response.

408
00:34:06,347 --> 00:34:10,169
And with that, we learned a lot of different things about our community.

409
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:20,714
But I do want to say that prior to that, in the fall of 2019, we did apply for our first municipal vulnerability preparedness grant.

410
00:34:21,274 --> 00:34:25,316
And I'm going to go in detail about all the work around this particular grant,

411
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:33,574
But I just want to point out that as I go through my presentation, there's a lot of things that we are doing that are feeding in to this project.

412
00:34:33,614 --> 00:34:35,675
So I want to kind of highlight them a little bit here.

413
00:34:35,735 --> 00:34:38,237
So we developed and operated the RUOK program.

414
00:34:39,117 --> 00:34:47,282
We use that program as a part of fact finding for our 2020 municipal variability preparedness grant.

415
00:34:47,762 --> 00:34:51,504
We had to move to a social service navigation model.

416
00:34:52,031 --> 00:34:55,914
because we were really just coming up with a lot of people who needed support.

417
00:34:56,335 --> 00:35:00,959
So our recovery coach at the time was also a master's in social work.

418
00:35:01,479 --> 00:35:08,666
She took on the responsibility of doing a lot of that work throughout the pandemic and since has built that position into the department.

419
00:35:09,006 --> 00:35:16,973
We also started the multilingual resource line and that has been a huge source of support for how we are engaging

420
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:18,868
able to communicate with the community.

421
00:35:18,888 --> 00:35:37,539
We had it for both the largest flows that we were having come into the office, but also really to be a place where folks with language that is not English as their first language can come to this line and can leave a message to us, for us, with us in their own language.

422
00:35:37,579 --> 00:35:43,502
And that's really a critical step in supporting our community members to trust that we're here to support them

423
00:35:44,029 --> 00:35:49,171
is figuring out a way to let them be the lead of what they need and us to follow suit.

424
00:35:49,692 --> 00:36:02,618
So we have, anyone can leave a message in any language, number one, but we have specifically Arabic, Spanish, Haitian, Creole, and then Portuguese, Brazilian, Portuguese specifically.

425
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:05,692
In addition to that, we started Medford Connects.

426
00:36:06,232 --> 00:36:15,821
Medford Connects was started in May, 2020 in response to the fact that many of us were kind of stuck in our own spaces and not communicating with other departments or other agencies.

427
00:36:16,308 --> 00:36:20,651
And so we started to come together and really start to think about what about youth mental health?

428
00:36:20,711 --> 00:36:21,812
What about health equity?

429
00:36:21,912 --> 00:36:23,133
How are we communicating?

430
00:36:23,173 --> 00:36:24,674
What are you hearing in the community?

431
00:36:25,154 --> 00:36:28,257
And this Medford Connects group really transformed.

432
00:36:28,277 --> 00:36:32,520
We met weekly throughout the pandemic to really support each other.

433
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,742
And we learned a lot throughout that process.

434
00:36:35,782 --> 00:36:38,964
And then we started to infuse the MVP project into it.

435
00:36:39,004 --> 00:36:40,886
So just laying down the foundation.

436
00:36:41,246 --> 00:36:45,349
The other thing I wanna make sure that I've said out loud is that we were funded through ARPA.

437
00:36:45,749 --> 00:36:58,442
for a health equity coordinator who manages five community liaisons, one representing the English-speaking BIPOC community, Arabic-speaking community, Spanish-speaking community, the Haitian community, and the Brazilian community.

438
00:36:58,883 --> 00:36:59,723
So we have those

439
00:37:00,507 --> 00:37:26,048
are all here working every week, and they're helping us to translate materials, they're helping us to communicate with our community members, manage this multilingual resource line, and they will begin in 2023, doing active outreach to support community members on things such as mass health applications and other applications in order to get support if they need it, in addition to just continuing to build community within

440
00:37:27,568 --> 00:37:33,892
these communities that haven't traditionally shown up at City Hall to have their voices heard.

441
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:37,594
So, and again, we have a social worker as well, which is Alicia Levin.

442
00:37:38,434 --> 00:37:45,798
So in 2017, we started to really think about like, okay, so we've done a lot of this opioid crisis response.

443
00:37:45,858 --> 00:37:47,339
We started to set up systems.

444
00:37:47,439 --> 00:37:56,324
We are operating those systems still today, but we also started to think a little bit bigger and broader about what we're doing in our work around prevention and outreach.

445
00:37:56,866 --> 00:38:02,784
And the social determinants of health is a really critical thing that we need to be working towards to address.

446
00:38:03,225 --> 00:38:04,926
So you see these health outcomes.

447
00:38:05,386 --> 00:38:07,707
These are all things that we know that we need to address.

448
00:38:07,747 --> 00:38:09,388
We want to prevent, right?

449
00:38:09,428 --> 00:38:12,110
But what are the behaviors that lead to these health outcomes?

450
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:24,956
We are also working on that, but what are we doing at this more deeper level around the social determinants of health, built environment, education, violence and trauma, employment, housing, social environment.

451
00:38:24,976 --> 00:38:32,080
These are some key places where we should start doing our efforts, but even more importantly, let's take a step back and let's dig a little bit deeper down to the roots

452
00:38:32,584 --> 00:38:39,967
these health outcomes, and those are classism, poverty, racism, xenophobia, ageism, so on and so forth.

453
00:38:40,008 --> 00:38:43,809
So we're looking at this in a comprehensive way, everything that we're doing.

454
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:57,256
And in 2020, when Alicia Hunt, at that time, Director of Sustainability, said, I think that this project would really fit well with the health department.

455
00:38:57,816 --> 00:38:59,016
We said, let's think about this.

456
00:38:59,056 --> 00:39:00,817
How can we understand it?

457
00:39:00,837 --> 00:39:02,258
And so really it was an assessment.

458
00:39:02,712 --> 00:39:06,594
find out and brainstorm what are the community's needs?

459
00:39:06,614 --> 00:39:08,394
What are their resiliency needs?

460
00:39:11,856 --> 00:39:17,798
So what is community, I'm sorry, what is climate vulnerability and climate resilience?

461
00:39:17,858 --> 00:39:23,100
These are lingo terms from the environmental sustainability industry.

462
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:25,501
They don't make a lot of sense to me sometimes.

463
00:39:25,601 --> 00:39:27,962
They probably don't make a lot of sense to the general public.

464
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,421
So let's break it down, right?

465
00:39:30,781 --> 00:39:33,081
And I am gonna read this because this is not my real house.

466
00:39:33,161 --> 00:39:35,182
So I'm gonna do that for myself.

467
00:39:35,662 --> 00:39:44,205
So climate vulnerability and resilience are measured by indicators related to exposure, sensitivity, climate hazards, coupled with the ability to get out of harm's way.

468
00:39:44,978 --> 00:39:48,120
to adjust to changes and rebuild after a climate event.

469
00:39:49,381 --> 00:39:53,864
We just actually experienced a major emergency event, right?

470
00:39:54,424 --> 00:39:57,306
And where were we when we started the pandemic?

471
00:39:57,406 --> 00:39:59,067
And then where did we end up after?

472
00:39:59,247 --> 00:40:00,368
How did we recover?

473
00:40:00,408 --> 00:40:05,111
All these things are very, they kind of apply that you can lay an overlay on it.

474
00:40:06,052 --> 00:40:11,015
But the folks that are in this harms way,

475
00:40:12,048 --> 00:40:28,631
and how fast they can adjust to changes really is indicated by rather than seeing these communities as climate vulnerable, we see communities that have been marginalized to the point of vulnerability, which is why we focus on adaptive capacity, right?

476
00:40:29,011 --> 00:40:36,252
So folks that don't feel they can trust the government, they don't feel they can trust, you know, what we're saying.

477
00:40:36,472 --> 00:40:39,693
We need to figure out how to repair this and to work hard at it.

478
00:40:39,773 --> 00:40:41,133
That's what we're trying to do.

479
00:40:41,782 --> 00:40:48,964
So as you can see though, in these sensitivity, exposure, adaptive capacity, all of these things really are within the wheelhouse.

480
00:40:48,984 --> 00:40:51,625
This is really what I just explained that we've been working towards.

481
00:40:53,085 --> 00:40:57,806
We did learn our adaptive capacity needs in that 2020 period.

482
00:40:58,166 --> 00:41:00,527
So we got a grant, the big pie in the sky.

483
00:41:00,567 --> 00:41:06,429
We didn't know there was gonna be a pandemic and we were gonna do all these things to really start reaching out and understanding what the needs are.

484
00:41:07,009 --> 00:41:10,550
And actually we were able to do that in the midst of the pandemic.

485
00:41:11,921 --> 00:41:19,704
You know, I'm really thankful for the woman who was coordinating this grant throughout the pandemic, because while we were all down in the trenches, she was moving this department forward.

486
00:41:20,145 --> 00:41:24,567
So Andrea is our, she's a wonderful, wonderful partner that we've been working with.

487
00:41:25,827 --> 00:41:28,969
We interviewed everyone that got an R U okay call.

488
00:41:29,209 --> 00:41:32,130
They got asked a series of questions about adaptive capacity.

489
00:41:32,843 --> 00:41:44,333
We've built our database of knowledge there with that, and with our elder population, our senior population, but we also did multiple rounds of listening sessions in multiple languages in 2020.

490
00:41:44,813 --> 00:41:49,597
With that came our hub report, which you can find on the city's website.

491
00:41:49,897 --> 00:41:51,799
That's what has established where we're going.

492
00:41:52,359 --> 00:41:54,081
So then we decided to,

493
00:41:57,450 --> 00:42:01,954
Well, we know what we know now, and we know that we need to do better outreach and engagement.

494
00:42:02,534 --> 00:42:04,416
We also know that we need to work on health equity.

495
00:42:04,436 --> 00:42:06,118
We need to work on racial equity.

496
00:42:06,278 --> 00:42:07,779
We need to understand bias, right?

497
00:42:07,879 --> 00:42:10,922
Because there's also a lot going on at this time in Med.

498
00:42:11,322 --> 00:42:24,854
So we decided to reapply for this grant and put it into three different buckets, community engagement through a team of five liaisons, provider partnership engagement through Medford Connects,

499
00:42:25,625 --> 00:42:34,373
And then interdepartmental engagement, where we did over the last two years, bring in trainings and presentations to staff.

500
00:42:34,793 --> 00:42:37,555
We talked about the nine dimensions of poverty.

501
00:42:37,936 --> 00:42:44,922
We brought in an excellent presenter this last June and into the summer, who really talked about bias and racial bias.

502
00:42:44,962 --> 00:42:48,185
So we've done a lot of this work as we've been going through our process.

503
00:42:50,643 --> 00:42:54,906
And really the concept here is to build a resiliency hub.

504
00:42:55,306 --> 00:42:56,827
So what is a resiliency hub?

505
00:42:56,887 --> 00:42:58,608
The climate industry, right?

506
00:42:58,648 --> 00:43:12,237
They believe that there's this idea that if we can have a building that's sustainable all by itself, not on the grid, that if there is an emergency, that in fact, we can go there as a community and address our needs in an emergency.

507
00:43:12,917 --> 00:43:17,120
That said, we need to support our communities before

508
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:18,551
there's an emergency.

509
00:43:18,711 --> 00:43:20,592
So they know to go to this resiliency.

510
00:43:20,853 --> 00:43:24,195
They can trust and they can predict that this is a viable place for them.

511
00:43:24,736 --> 00:43:25,637
So we want to do this.

512
00:43:25,897 --> 00:43:29,360
We want to support communities before, during, and then after our climate emergency.

513
00:43:30,701 --> 00:43:35,585
So Medford Connects will expand and strengthen our community support.

514
00:43:35,605 --> 00:43:39,108
And I've lost my picture.

515
00:43:40,869 --> 00:43:43,291
To withstand, to support our marginalized groups,

516
00:43:44,423 --> 00:43:47,364
the climate change recover from these climate crises.

517
00:43:47,844 --> 00:43:55,848
In other words, we hope that Medford's adaptive capacity climate change by supporting our community groups will help us in these as we continue.

518
00:43:56,408 --> 00:43:58,729
We know that climate change is coming, right?

519
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:06,212
It is happening now and the effects of climate change will put us in a position to have to respond and be prepared to respond.

520
00:44:06,572 --> 00:44:09,433
So that's where we are in understanding what we're doing.

521
00:44:10,101 --> 00:44:13,965
So as I said, we piloted our community liaison model.

522
00:44:14,005 --> 00:44:16,006
We started reaching out to our communities.

523
00:44:16,587 --> 00:44:26,276
We started thinking to ourselves, okay, so where is this mythical building in the city of Medford that we can make it energy efficient and independent?

524
00:44:26,836 --> 00:44:29,839
And the reality is, is we don't have that building.

525
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:32,822
And if we have it, it's not available right now.

526
00:44:33,382 --> 00:44:35,624
So we still need to do this work, right?

527
00:44:37,173 --> 00:44:40,174
We got down to it and we thought, well, how can we do this differently?

528
00:44:40,194 --> 00:44:58,378
So in our outreach to our other communities, so we were able to form an Arabic task force, we were able to form a Haitian task force, and we are currently and still reaching out to the other communities to continue to build that partnership and that understanding.

529
00:44:58,738 --> 00:45:03,301
but we did a lot of needs assessment to understand what would it need to have?

530
00:45:03,381 --> 00:45:05,562
What was this resiliency need to have?

531
00:45:05,622 --> 00:45:08,264
So instead we created a network.

532
00:45:09,204 --> 00:45:12,366
We came up with the concept of the resiliency hub network.

533
00:45:12,466 --> 00:45:13,827
This is an operations plan.

534
00:45:13,847 --> 00:45:14,748
It's in your folder.

535
00:45:15,208 --> 00:45:17,690
This is all working with our climate

536
00:45:19,123 --> 00:45:25,637
our climate partners and consultants about what is needed in Resiliency Hub.

537
00:45:25,657 --> 00:45:26,779
What does the research say?

538
00:45:26,839 --> 00:45:28,122
What does the industry say?

539
00:45:28,202 --> 00:45:30,567
In addition to what does the community need and what do they say?

540
00:45:31,195 --> 00:45:40,183
So we wanna create spaces where Metro residents can build face-to-face connections, celebrate together, support each other and access resources and services as they need them.

541
00:45:40,523 --> 00:45:47,730
So ideally this location would be a place that you go and maybe you play cards, but you could also maybe pick up some food, right?

542
00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:55,577
You could also get the information to get navigated to a social service navigation, like our Alicia, our social worker.

543
00:45:57,682 --> 00:46:00,363
So where we are now, we did get that next round of funding.

544
00:46:00,503 --> 00:46:10,688
And what we also found out was really exciting is that the state thinks our model is so important that they are now requiring this model in their future proposals from other communities.

545
00:46:10,708 --> 00:46:11,808
So that's very cool.

546
00:46:11,888 --> 00:46:13,109
I'm actually proud of that.

547
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:15,170
So what are we doing?

548
00:46:15,853 --> 00:46:23,656
We are going to work with our Medford Connects group, folks that have been attending this group regularly and thinking it through, like how do we work better together?

549
00:46:23,716 --> 00:46:24,997
How do we work smoother together?

550
00:46:25,737 --> 00:46:27,518
Medford is a social service desert.

551
00:46:27,578 --> 00:46:30,159
We don't have our providers living within the city.

552
00:46:30,679 --> 00:46:35,041
We have Wayside and their wonderful YMCA moved in to support us.

553
00:46:35,542 --> 00:46:38,743
They have a youth center and they have Mystic Community Market.

554
00:46:39,268 --> 00:46:41,310
And West Medford Community Center, that's really it, right?

555
00:46:41,631 --> 00:46:47,116
Medford Family Network is also an agency, but they are also under the city's school system.

556
00:46:47,457 --> 00:46:49,799
So it's a quasi nonprofit as well.

557
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,342
But these are our key supporters.

558
00:46:52,522 --> 00:47:00,911
So we all collaborated together with a couple of departments as well to start thinking about how are we gonna communicate better and how are we gonna do this work?

559
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:11,545
So with this change in focus and this understanding that we don't have a physical location, we are moving to a virtual resiliency hub model, right?

560
00:47:11,605 --> 00:47:14,827
We're gonna centralize and localize services and information.

561
00:47:14,847 --> 00:47:24,611
We're gonna formalize a network of community providers, and we're going to set the foundation for resilient communication.

562
00:47:25,232 --> 00:47:25,412
So,

563
00:47:27,075 --> 00:47:33,100
As you can see here, these are all programs that there are programs that live within the city right but how are they all connected.

564
00:47:33,801 --> 00:47:42,929
So, there's a couple different things that we will do but one of the key things we're going to be able to do with this funding is purchase a software called unite and unite us.

565
00:47:43,667 --> 00:47:47,389
is a system, it's a software program, right?

566
00:47:47,689 --> 00:47:51,951
With a lot of extra support from that company to help us build up a network.

567
00:47:52,491 --> 00:47:58,814
But effectively, our social worker can go in and say, this person needs housing, they need food, they need this.

568
00:47:59,215 --> 00:48:06,078
They can refer from that system all at once to three or four different agencies, all of course partnered into the system, right?

569
00:48:06,558 --> 00:48:08,359
It can't just, somebody has to receive it.

570
00:48:08,419 --> 00:48:09,960
So we have to have that formal partnership.

571
00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:12,451
continue to work towards that and build that.

572
00:48:13,172 --> 00:48:23,420
And we hope that that will help streamline our communications and just knowing that we have a hub for crisis, but not for prevention.

573
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:34,809
And these efforts will help us to prevent evictions, they'll help us to prevent starvation or not being connected to services or waiting too long to get what we need.

574
00:48:37,657 --> 00:48:40,320
The project is going to do a number of different things.

575
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:51,911
One of the key things that we're going to do though, is make sure that all of our partners within the hub, I mean, within the Medford Connects are going to be working on language access.

576
00:48:51,971 --> 00:48:56,015
They're going to look at translation of key materials that they regularly put out.

577
00:48:56,815 --> 00:49:02,521
And then we will also be working with them to get more frequent communications as we move forward.

578
00:49:03,628 --> 00:49:11,470
more frequent communications out in it that are smaller, you know, flyers, different blurbs that they want to put out social media, stuff like that.

579
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:16,512
So some of the key things that we are also going to do are English for speakers of other languages.

580
00:49:16,532 --> 00:49:29,175
So ESOL, the library and Medford family network are going to partner together and they will have a staff member who will help to build up our ESOL courses in the city and coordinate with other agencies in the area that are doing them.

581
00:49:29,832 --> 00:49:40,735
We're gonna work with our council on aging to help them reach more diverse population and think through the communications that need to happen there.

582
00:49:41,215 --> 00:49:50,138
We're working with the YMCA in partnership with the rec department to do youth work around social emotional skills to withstand future crises, right?

583
00:49:50,238 --> 00:49:53,159
And thinking about how that can apply throughout the community as well.

584
00:49:53,739 --> 00:49:57,420
We're gonna be continuing to infuse more support into the Medford Family Network.

585
00:49:58,752 --> 00:49:58,914
to

586
00:50:00,733 --> 00:50:02,854
to continue to enhance the work that she's doing.

587
00:50:04,014 --> 00:50:07,235
Everyone knows Marie is the Medford, she is our heart and soul.

588
00:50:07,255 --> 00:50:08,835
So the Medford Family Network, right?

589
00:50:08,855 --> 00:50:10,275
We're gonna be working on that with them.

590
00:50:11,356 --> 00:50:23,739
And then we are working with the West Medford Community Center to look at elevating by our black, indigenous and residents of color and locations of local positions of leadership and economic security.

591
00:50:24,039 --> 00:50:28,740
So they have a really great evidence-based model that they'll be utilizing called circles

592
00:50:29,167 --> 00:50:34,890
that takes mentorship from a professional that's doing, you know, really enjoys their career and wants to mentor others.

593
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:38,071
And then they'll mentor folks and they're going to match people up in that regard.

594
00:50:39,131 --> 00:50:49,936
And then we are working very intensely with our MISTA community market.

595
00:50:50,596 --> 00:50:53,578
So MISTA community market will be,

596
00:50:55,181 --> 00:51:06,306
working on a food justice council to look at how we can shape local foodscapes and systems that are shaped by people who have experienced them and not people who haven't.

597
00:51:06,806 --> 00:51:15,530
So we'll be working with them on that as well as another of other communications, ensuring that all of their materials are translated, so on and so forth.

598
00:51:16,276 --> 00:51:17,656
So this is our network here.

599
00:51:18,116 --> 00:51:21,997
We have, as I said, I kind of went through it, but this is the visual of it.

600
00:51:22,598 --> 00:51:29,259
And as you can see, all of the partners that I cited, we are also partnered with the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability.

601
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:33,980
They are our guru on environment and climate change.

602
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:45,283
So we need their support overall, but they also, it's a great place for them to hear from our community, what's going on, hear from these partners and how they can build that into strategic planning for our community going forward.

603
00:51:47,022 --> 00:51:58,632
And then we have the communications department here at City Hall, who will be really looking at how they're going to be the center of disseminating how we get information out in multiple languages.

604
00:51:58,992 --> 00:52:05,157
They're going to sort of be the point person and we're going to make sure that everything's driving throughout the network and in concert with the city.

605
00:52:05,698 --> 00:52:11,823
And then finally, Diversity, Equity, Inclusion Director Frances Noget is going to help us make sure that we are

606
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:17,984
doing this to the fullest and the most equitable way, and we are most inclusive.

607
00:52:18,464 --> 00:52:27,311
In addition, she has funding to provide more trainings for the community, for our partners, for the city employees.

608
00:52:28,872 --> 00:52:38,679
So the final piece of this project is that, and this is why I told you we have Medford community liaisons, we are also hiring more teams of community

609
00:52:39,273 --> 00:52:42,616
We're calling them Medford Connectors because we don't want to confuse anyone.

610
00:52:42,956 --> 00:52:46,438
We have community liaisons that are attached to the health department doing health department work.

611
00:52:46,779 --> 00:52:50,601
And we have our community liaisons attached to this project.

612
00:52:50,642 --> 00:52:51,942
We're calling them Medford Connectors.

613
00:52:52,323 --> 00:53:03,151
They will support everyone in this network on language access, interpretation, and as well as, you know, just thinking through projects before we implement projects.

614
00:53:04,077 --> 00:53:04,597
And that's it.

615
00:53:04,637 --> 00:53:05,837
That's all I have to really tell you.

616
00:53:05,897 --> 00:53:07,558
This is a part of the process.

617
00:53:07,618 --> 00:53:09,098
It's letting you know what we're doing.

618
00:53:09,598 --> 00:53:11,259
We are working on our contracts.

619
00:53:11,319 --> 00:53:20,141
We will be hiring up these Medford Connectors and all of these support staff for our grant, but we are at the start of a new process.

620
00:53:20,741 --> 00:53:21,101
So that's it.

621
00:53:23,741 --> 00:53:24,221
Thank you so much.

622
00:53:24,381 --> 00:53:26,262
I know Councilor Scarpelli wants to speak.

623
00:53:26,282 --> 00:53:26,822
I just sent him to.

624
00:53:27,539 --> 00:53:29,341
on an errand for Vice President Behrs.

625
00:53:29,401 --> 00:53:30,282
Thank you, Madam President.

626
00:53:30,763 --> 00:53:34,307
Thank you, Penny, for reaching out to me to make this presentation.

627
00:53:34,327 --> 00:53:43,238
I think it's really important for us to hear and for anyone who's in the community to hear the great work that we're doing.

628
00:53:43,278 --> 00:53:45,521
I think this is really showing how we're bringing together

629
00:53:48,185 --> 00:54:05,949
so much of the response work and whether we're talking about climate or substance use disorder or food insecurity or housing insecurity or all the other issues that we know so many people in our community are facing, but also just bringing the community together in general and building a more resilient community.

630
00:54:06,009 --> 00:54:17,612
I mean, I think something that we have been talking about and will continue to be talking about is social emotional support for young people in our community and also making sure that seniors have connection to the resources that they need in our community.

631
00:54:18,272 --> 00:54:24,541
And I just think that this is really showing that there's an intentional approach and that the staff on the ground are really doing amazing work.

632
00:54:25,193 --> 00:54:29,576
not just in bringing in funding so that we can do this, which I know is really tough.

633
00:54:30,216 --> 00:54:35,079
And one of the reasons that it hadn't been done before is we have huge budgetary problems.

634
00:54:35,099 --> 00:54:48,708
So I'm glad that there's a pool of money that you're able to access for this, but also how we can really embed it throughout all of our public institutions from our public schools to our city departments to our nonprofit organizations going forward.

635
00:54:50,308 --> 00:54:59,313
It's really impressive work, really thankful to you and everyone who's been working on it and obviously continue to love to support and help out.

636
00:54:59,673 --> 00:55:00,013
Thank you.

637
00:55:00,413 --> 00:55:01,414
Thank you.

638
00:55:01,674 --> 00:55:02,454
Thank you, Madam President.

639
00:55:03,115 --> 00:55:04,475
Thank you, Penny, for all your hard work.

640
00:55:04,595 --> 00:55:11,059
You've done so much for our community and I really appreciate everything you do.

641
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:11,599
So I think that

642
00:55:12,816 --> 00:55:15,779
One thing I realized as I'm reading through this, this is, it's amazing.

643
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:18,403
This is what we've lacked here for a long time.

644
00:55:18,483 --> 00:55:25,331
So I appreciate your effort, but a most vulnerable community right now, have we, I didn't see anything with the housing.

645
00:55:25,371 --> 00:55:30,618
Are we partnering anything with the Meffitt Housing Department to reach those families that I think that

646
00:55:31,972 --> 00:55:38,359
Yeah, we are partnering with them through our health equity coordinator and the work that we're doing with our social work.

647
00:55:38,699 --> 00:55:39,179
Okay.

648
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:43,063
We definitely are in in communication and working with them.

649
00:55:44,024 --> 00:55:47,028
This is just it was just a formal partnership for the grant.

650
00:55:47,248 --> 00:55:48,629
Okay, what I'm expressing.

651
00:55:48,709 --> 00:55:50,071
So obviously, there'll be a big piece.

652
00:55:50,111 --> 00:55:50,791
Yeah, definitely.

653
00:55:51,212 --> 00:55:51,572
All right.

654
00:55:51,672 --> 00:55:52,333
Thank you so much.

655
00:55:52,934 --> 00:55:54,195
Thank you, Councillor Singh.

656
00:55:55,689 --> 00:55:59,592
First of all, I just wanted to thank you and your department for all this work that you're doing.

657
00:56:00,733 --> 00:56:14,865
I think something that a few of us, many of us on this side of the rail have been talking about, a lot of community leaders have been talking about is the importance of bringing government to the people and not just expecting people to show up.

658
00:56:16,926 --> 00:56:24,052
We all know that there are real equity access barriers when it comes to meetings, even meetings like this.

659
00:56:24,783 --> 00:56:40,176
any city meeting, any coming to city events, and your department's, I think, philosophical approach to outreach, I think is something that we should be proud that we're doing as a city.

660
00:56:40,196 --> 00:56:50,584
I know it can be really tough to do that outreach, and so I was wondering what some of the challenges that you've found were.

661
00:56:51,205 --> 00:56:53,727
Maybe, I know the community liaisons have been doing a great job,

662
00:56:54,333 --> 00:57:08,705
but I'm wondering what are some of the barriers that you guys have faced and what are some of the ways that you're gonna address that with the Medford Connectors program in terms of outreach and getting to more people?

663
00:57:10,146 --> 00:57:11,247
So that's a great question.

664
00:57:11,267 --> 00:57:20,475
I mean, the major issue that we have is the same issue that every city in town is having right now and that is that there is no housing.

665
00:57:21,873 --> 00:57:23,174
There's no emergency shelter.

666
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:26,157
Someone comes here and says, I don't have anywhere to go tonight.

667
00:57:26,277 --> 00:57:27,578
I don't have anywhere to send them.

668
00:57:27,898 --> 00:57:30,161
The shelters are full, they're full early.

669
00:57:30,181 --> 00:57:33,904
That is our biggest worry.

670
00:57:33,944 --> 00:57:37,627
That's what we walk home at night, like we feel awful, right?

671
00:57:37,647 --> 00:57:39,529
Because we don't have good answers when that happens.

672
00:57:40,410 --> 00:57:44,674
And the reality is, is we have to just be very honest with people in that regard.

673
00:57:46,664 --> 00:57:57,453
One of the things that we did do that I think what really needs to happen is that we really do need to explain what can you access here in the city of Medford.

674
00:57:57,794 --> 00:58:02,938
So I was remiss to say that our library has incredible services.

675
00:58:03,418 --> 00:58:07,122
They have tools that community members can use, right?

676
00:58:07,662 --> 00:58:11,005
They are definitely a resiliency hub in so many regards, right?

677
00:58:11,461 --> 00:58:23,847
So, driving people to these locations that can be a part of your everyday life in this community is really, really important.

678
00:58:24,027 --> 00:58:39,955
And also to think about this grant is very much about that, getting people to be in and a part of, and for us to go out to and truly create this to be like a home for everyone that lives here, that this is their home, regardless of the way our society is,

679
00:58:40,297 --> 00:58:46,008
where a lot of people live online right and they talk online and they commune online and stuff like that.

680
00:58:46,409 --> 00:58:51,640
So, you know, one of the key things we want to continue to do is describe city services right like

681
00:58:52,387 --> 00:59:05,114
what kind of violations do people get parking violations, trash, maybe violations, right, like these things that are costly to community members, we need to communicate better what those are and what the rules are, and have access to that.

682
00:59:05,154 --> 00:59:12,738
So it's not like, you know, my artworks at City Hall, and I know that I could I could do this, we need to just make those things a little bit more ready for everybody in the community.

683
00:59:13,498 --> 00:59:24,083
And when the website, when the new website is up, we do have recorded videos, audio videos in other languages about most of the city services, sort of like a FAQ for each department.

684
00:59:24,423 --> 00:59:27,364
We have that like ready and prepared from the previous round of funding.

685
00:59:27,384 --> 00:59:29,145
We just need to get it up live and out.

686
00:59:30,706 --> 00:59:39,410
I don't know that I really answered your question, but I think the issue is, is that us becoming more connected and communicative is really, really important.

687
00:59:39,917 --> 00:59:44,080
There is another, but what we are currently faced with is so overwhelming.

688
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:48,264
It's much like that opioid crisis is like, where do we even begin?

689
00:59:48,284 --> 00:59:53,308
And really there's things the state has to do to make those changes to support our community members.

690
00:59:54,885 --> 00:59:56,426
You guys have been doing incredible work.

691
00:59:56,866 --> 00:59:58,187
I really appreciate that answer.

692
00:59:58,207 --> 01:00:10,494
And what you were talking about, and I think the work you guys are doing, I think, lays out a foundation for what other departments in the city can do, including the city council, maybe in the further future.

693
01:00:10,514 --> 01:00:22,802
I think you guys are testing the waters, seeing what works, and perhaps in the future, our city council and other branches of government, other departments of the government can look towards you guys and see

694
01:00:23,465 --> 01:00:34,449
what we can do to be more inclusive to get more of those voices that haven't been included in city government to help us come to our meetings and help us, you know, give us feedback and shape our agendas.

695
01:00:35,249 --> 01:00:36,050
So that's helpful.

696
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:39,751
I think my question was slightly, slightly more about

697
01:00:40,371 --> 01:00:47,741
How are we reaching the residents that we haven't reached yet, which I know can be a really difficult question to answer and I'm sure you guys are already working on it.

698
01:00:48,082 --> 01:00:55,612
I was wondering if you guys partner with other city departments to, you know, keep track of who comes in for city services already or

699
01:00:56,652 --> 01:01:14,282
In terms of maybe a city, the work that we do collecting server data with our city city census type things, seeing if I think who moves into the city, pays our taxes perhaps there's a way to, even in, I know this can be costly but putting, putting

700
01:01:15,302 --> 01:01:25,807
even a short flyer in our water bills or something like that to try to get more people aware that your department exists, that the work that you guys are doing exists.

701
01:01:25,968 --> 01:01:29,629
And maybe that will reach more people, but you are the expert here, so.

702
01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:32,191
Yeah, I think that you're totally right.

703
01:01:33,051 --> 01:01:39,494
One of the things that we're looking at is like, okay, so we need to continue to build relationships with all of our faith communities.

704
01:01:39,694 --> 01:01:40,655
That's one key thing.

705
01:01:41,076 --> 01:01:50,343
The other piece that we are working on actively right now is going through our entire database of businesses and working in that angle as well.

706
01:01:50,803 --> 01:02:01,911
So, I think that I'll have a better answer and a more concrete answer for you in about six months when we get all of our staff in place and people are moving and operating.

707
01:02:03,232 --> 01:02:10,757
But I wanna say though, one of the key things that has been a benefit since the RUOK or our social service navigation began

708
01:02:11,376 --> 01:02:16,837
is that we have 89 referrals from city employees to the social worker to get somebody help.

709
01:02:16,937 --> 01:02:32,320
So we're definitely getting the word out across the city departments that we can help individuals that, you know, the other thing to note is that if I show up and I say I have a housing issue, I have other things that I need to be processed through.

710
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:38,121
So that's why we really want our city social worker to kind of work with that person and ask those really like,

711
01:02:38,785 --> 01:02:41,246
really hard questions for someone to reflect on.

712
01:02:41,706 --> 01:02:54,532
And so we really do want city department, we want our folks that work here to get the person to the right place in order to get the information that they need, that that actually will be able to be viable, right?

713
01:02:54,592 --> 01:02:57,354
Just giving someone a pamphlet doesn't solve their issue.

714
01:02:58,194 --> 01:03:02,396
We're not gonna solve their issue either, but we can at least give them the correct information and the correct numbers.

715
01:03:03,874 --> 01:03:04,515
That's excellent.

716
01:03:05,095 --> 01:03:15,603
And I think to what you've been saying, you know, as a son of immigrant parents, I've had to translate a lot of things, find out a lot of things about city services.

717
01:03:15,643 --> 01:03:16,644
It would be super helpful.

718
01:03:17,804 --> 01:03:19,606
The things that you're describing will be super helpful.

719
01:03:19,766 --> 01:03:28,352
So, and I think lay out groundwork for, you know, the work that we want to do on youth mental health on, you know, making our community safer as well.

720
01:03:28,372 --> 01:03:29,073
So thank you so much.

721
01:03:29,093 --> 01:03:31,134
Thank you.

722
01:03:33,123 --> 01:03:33,944
Thank you, Madam President.

723
01:03:34,004 --> 01:03:39,867
I don't know if Councilor Tang just asked my question, but I don't see the Asian population represented here.

724
01:03:40,248 --> 01:03:42,629
And they're the largest growing segment of our community right now.

725
01:03:43,510 --> 01:03:50,875
And I don't know- So our plan is for this particular grant round is to expand one of our roles.

726
01:03:51,095 --> 01:03:59,420
We have a BIPOC connector role, and we want to really relegate that and reach out to the Asian community.

727
01:03:59,740 --> 01:04:01,922
I was with some people in Somerville and they just put on

728
01:04:03,054 --> 01:04:05,416
an Asian liaison in their community.

729
01:04:05,476 --> 01:04:06,697
So I hope that we can do that.

730
01:04:06,717 --> 01:04:08,679
Thank you so much for pointing that out.

731
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:09,379
Thank you.

732
01:04:09,539 --> 01:04:10,140
Councillor Collins.

733
01:04:12,361 --> 01:04:19,367
Thank you so much, Penny, for being here tonight and for presenting, you know, some of the process and progress that's gone into the work that this grant has enabled.

734
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:29,334
I think, you know, over the past year, this grant, I mean, I know it's gone on for more than the past year, but you know, what's come out of this has been one of the things that I, you know, feel most proud of in the city.

735
01:04:29,935 --> 01:04:30,355
It's really

736
01:04:31,024 --> 01:04:43,354
great to be able to see some first steps towards language equity, doing a better job of reaching out to the people who, you know, historically do not show up to city hall or not reached out to don't speak the language, you know, in whatever way, I think this is really important work.

737
01:04:43,874 --> 01:04:51,140
Um, and it's great to get sort of these concrete facts about what specifically has been done, what the grant has been, has enabled the city to do.

738
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:56,744
Um, I think that it's important for us to get a picture of what, um, doing that, doing that work of bringing

739
01:04:57,220 --> 01:05:04,763
more of the community into community spaces, how that breaks down into roles and positions and programs, kind of gives those numbers some context.

740
01:05:06,643 --> 01:05:23,669
As a counselor, and I know that you in your office, you get this 10 times more than we do, but we hear from people looking for housing, we hear from people who are looking for pro bono legal representation, the eviction crisis in Medford Square several months ago, eviction help, tenant organizing,

741
01:05:24,197 --> 01:05:26,959
I've been very involved with the mutual aid network for several years.

742
01:05:28,020 --> 01:05:39,591
What strikes me every time these conversations come up is it seems like over and over again, we hit against the fact that even our provider network are very close to hitting their bandwidth.

743
01:05:39,631 --> 01:05:40,111
And I know that.

744
01:05:42,487 --> 01:05:49,270
It's in my mind so strongly all the time that our regional network of providers is inundated.

745
01:05:49,490 --> 01:05:53,191
There's so much need, you said for housing, food insecurity, there's so much need.

746
01:05:53,231 --> 01:05:58,653
And I know that that's one of the many things that we need a regional approach for, we need more state assistance for.

747
01:05:59,773 --> 01:06:10,157
Where this comes in as I think, given that it's so important for us to streamline on the local level as much as possible to make sure that everybody in our community who needs those resources can access them in an easy way.

748
01:06:10,752 --> 01:06:15,896
I think this program is doing that and that everybody in the community can have equitable access to the resources that are available.

749
01:06:16,597 --> 01:06:24,984
And I really hope that that work can continue in parallel with regionally and with our other providers working to make sure that we have more places to direct people to.

750
01:06:26,305 --> 01:06:31,289
I'm sure it's heartbreaking for your staff every time you have to say, I can get you on that wait list.

751
01:06:31,309 --> 01:06:32,350
I can get you on that list.

752
01:06:32,390 --> 01:06:33,931
I can't get you on that wait list.

753
01:06:33,991 --> 01:06:35,993
And I'm sure that's really hard.

754
01:06:37,303 --> 01:06:38,183
I just thank you for this work.

755
01:06:38,223 --> 01:06:39,784
I'm really excited to see how it continues.

756
01:06:39,824 --> 01:06:44,445
And like vice president Baird said, so anyway, this council can support you and continue that work.

757
01:06:45,126 --> 01:06:46,246
We're partners with you.

758
01:06:46,266 --> 01:06:47,206
Thank you so much.

759
01:06:47,226 --> 01:06:52,588
Thank you, Councilor Collins.

760
01:06:54,488 --> 01:06:55,389
Penny, I just had one question.

761
01:06:55,429 --> 01:06:59,750
So you mentioned part of the work really needing to lean on the communications department at city hall.

762
01:07:00,270 --> 01:07:02,971
So I understand that the communications department is essentially, it's one person.

763
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:06,312
So is there any funding in this grant

764
01:07:06,932 --> 01:07:12,374
you know, funds additional communication support, because I think that's something we always run into in all aspects of city hall.

765
01:07:12,394 --> 01:07:14,474
And I also, I don't want to detract from any of your work.

766
01:07:14,494 --> 01:07:18,776
This is incredible work, the work of you, the liaisons, everyone, like this is so much work.

767
01:07:19,376 --> 01:07:25,318
I want to make sure, you know, communication supports that, but understanding how under, you know, it's one person, so.

768
01:07:26,418 --> 01:07:31,020
So we have, the city has hired a COVID-19, you know,

769
01:07:34,877 --> 01:07:36,558
communications support.

770
01:07:36,658 --> 01:07:38,479
So there is two people now, that's great.

771
01:07:38,959 --> 01:07:42,400
So that's excellent.

772
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:48,303
And I think that that role really is absolutely applicable to supporting this grant.

773
01:07:48,723 --> 01:07:50,984
So we do have that as a fortunate positive.

774
01:07:51,364 --> 01:07:55,726
We do have a little bit of money to go along like formal translations.

775
01:07:56,186 --> 01:07:58,267
It's not a lot of money to be able to do that.

776
01:07:58,407 --> 01:08:00,228
Obviously that's a big budget.

777
01:08:00,547 --> 01:08:07,233
So we have to be obviously thoughtful about what we're gonna use that funding for, but we do have the money relegated to help them to do that.

778
01:08:07,513 --> 01:08:12,017
And then I think that's all I was supposed to say.

779
01:08:12,117 --> 01:08:15,280
Okay, thank you, I appreciate it.

780
01:08:16,001 --> 01:08:20,044
On the motion of Councilor Carviel to receive and place on file second by Councilor Knight.

781
01:08:20,144 --> 01:08:21,245
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

782
01:08:21,506 --> 01:08:21,926
Thank you, Penny.

783
01:08:36,910 --> 01:08:37,450
Councilor Kerrio?

784
01:08:37,630 --> 01:08:37,890
Yes.

785
01:08:38,310 --> 01:08:38,831
Councilor Collins?

786
01:08:38,991 --> 01:08:39,271
Yes.

787
01:08:39,511 --> 01:08:39,931
Councilor Nunez?

788
01:08:40,131 --> 01:08:40,431
Yes.

789
01:08:40,611 --> 01:08:41,231
Councilor Stroud?

790
01:08:41,351 --> 01:08:41,691
Yes.

791
01:08:41,771 --> 01:08:42,251
Councilor Sanz?

792
01:08:42,792 --> 01:08:43,072
Yes.

793
01:08:43,972 --> 01:08:44,372
Councilor Morocco?

794
01:08:44,692 --> 01:08:44,892
Yes.

795
01:08:44,972 --> 01:08:48,333
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

796
01:08:48,353 --> 01:09:03,837
22-604 offered by Vice President Behrs, be it so resolved by the Metro City Council that the finance director appear at the December 20th, 2022 regular meeting to present the fiscal year 2023 quarter one financial update and warrant articles as requested by the council on a multitude of occasions.

797
01:09:04,348 --> 01:09:14,154
The mayor and city administration committed that this information would be present presented to the city council and the public by a mid November deadline that has not been met.

798
01:09:15,414 --> 01:09:20,097
Okay.

799
01:09:20,312 --> 01:09:22,413
Thank you, Madam President.

800
01:09:22,713 --> 01:09:35,699
And I also do recognize that Councilor Knight did submit an amendment to this paper requesting that the documents be presented to the Council in advance of a presentation and that the presentation be tabled to the next regularly scheduled meeting.

801
01:09:36,259 --> 01:09:39,860
So I don't know what you have tonight for us, Director Dickinson.

802
01:09:39,881 --> 01:09:49,645
I'd be happy to hear kind of a short update, but I do agree that in order for us to be fully prepared for a budget presentation and financial update, having the documents in advance would be helpful.

803
01:09:50,405 --> 01:09:55,267
I don't want to speak for Councilor Knight beyond that, but I do understand that concern.

804
01:09:55,507 --> 01:09:57,728
So, you know, I'll just put that out there.

805
01:09:59,768 --> 01:10:00,549
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

806
01:10:01,089 --> 01:10:02,890
Councilor Knight or would you like to hear from?

807
01:10:02,930 --> 01:10:10,212
No, I'd like to know why we still haven't received one copy of one Warren article since January of 2020.

808
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:14,620
2020 2021 now 2021.

809
01:10:15,701 --> 01:10:17,541
We have not received one copy of one more article.

810
01:10:17,981 --> 01:10:21,522
You sat here before this body and put a budget presentation on.

811
01:10:22,122 --> 01:10:25,784
And we made it pretty darn clear that we want this document.

812
01:10:26,344 --> 01:10:34,366
This council has passed countless resolutions saying we want this document, yet your offices failed to provide it time and time again.

813
01:10:35,126 --> 01:10:36,627
Now, Bob, I know you're new to the city.

814
01:10:37,227 --> 01:10:37,987
And, you know,

815
01:10:38,993 --> 01:10:43,854
At some point, you got to say I'm not blaming you, but now I am blaming you because you're sat here before us in June.

816
01:10:44,854 --> 01:10:47,275
When we asked for this document, we still haven't received it.

817
01:10:47,815 --> 01:10:49,255
The council's taken numerous votes.

818
01:10:49,475 --> 01:10:54,736
The mayor's office has said, refer it to the finance director in a response to this body, but we still haven't received it.

819
01:10:55,396 --> 01:10:55,676
Why?

820
01:10:58,617 --> 01:11:02,358
All right.

821
01:11:04,198 --> 01:11:06,359
What precisely are you looking for?

822
01:11:06,659 --> 01:11:08,159
I mean, is this a for real story right now?

823
01:11:08,399 --> 01:11:09,620
This is a for real story.

824
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:15,882
I mean, literally, after a year and a half of waiting for this document.

825
01:11:16,022 --> 01:11:16,742
I'm sorry.

826
01:11:17,522 --> 01:11:21,243
We've been asking for this document for a year and a half and he goes, what are you asking for now?

827
01:11:21,763 --> 01:11:23,784
I mean, is this- I understand the frustration.

828
01:11:23,824 --> 01:11:25,144
No, this isn't even about frustration.

829
01:11:25,164 --> 01:11:26,925
It's about a waste of my goddamn time.

830
01:11:27,445 --> 01:11:28,285
All right, that's what this is.

831
01:11:28,725 --> 01:11:29,526
All right, it's a waste.

832
01:11:29,666 --> 01:11:33,887
It's a waste of all of our time to come up here and be pranced around like dog and pony.

833
01:11:37,793 --> 01:11:38,453
Director Dickinson.

834
01:11:38,473 --> 01:11:40,235
To be pranced around like doggies.

835
01:11:40,475 --> 01:11:42,356
Warren articles are passed by this body.

836
01:11:42,416 --> 01:11:43,937
They're not passed by this body.

837
01:11:44,658 --> 01:11:52,483
We've never voted on a Warren article in the last decade.

838
01:11:53,123 --> 01:11:56,145
Director Dickinson, do you have an update for us or anything you can provide?

839
01:11:57,006 --> 01:11:58,927
Well, I'd like to clear this up.

840
01:11:59,468 --> 01:12:01,609
I want to give this body everything that it wants.

841
01:12:02,650 --> 01:12:03,771
I really do.

842
01:12:04,211 --> 01:12:05,512
You know, I came here

843
01:12:06,574 --> 01:12:09,476
I have the budget tactuals for the first quarter.

844
01:12:09,496 --> 01:12:16,080
I have revenue projections that unfortunately are locked up in my computer, which died.

845
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:19,322
But I can email all that stuff to you.

846
01:12:19,342 --> 01:12:28,487
I really don't wanna sit here and there's no reason for me not to give you stuff that you want.

847
01:12:28,667 --> 01:12:31,109
I just, okay, and we're on the same page.

848
01:12:31,809 --> 01:12:32,470
We really are.

849
01:12:32,910 --> 01:12:35,552
I'm not really sure physically what it is.

850
01:12:36,977 --> 01:12:39,519
Warren articles are passed by this body.

851
01:12:39,759 --> 01:12:40,119
They're not.

852
01:12:40,419 --> 01:12:42,381
We've never voted on them once, ever.

853
01:12:43,922 --> 01:12:45,863
They're never presented to us, Bob.

854
01:12:45,883 --> 01:12:46,544
What are we looking for?

855
01:12:46,564 --> 01:12:47,604
I want to know how much money K.P.

856
01:12:47,624 --> 01:12:50,466
Lawrence received in the past year, for example.

857
01:12:55,947 --> 01:13:02,030
So I can take a look at the Warren articles and I can say, oh, geez, we have a budget in the law department that says they're going to spend 200,000.

858
01:13:02,390 --> 01:13:06,952
But I'm looking here in the last six months, we spent $1.7 million at KP Law.

859
01:13:07,012 --> 01:13:07,252
Why?

860
01:13:07,612 --> 01:13:13,575
And I can get ahead of some of these issues so that come the budget in probably, we'll get away, maybe June 30th.

861
01:13:13,975 --> 01:13:21,799
When we get to June 30th for July 1st vote, I might be able to have a little bit of understanding as to why we're in the situation we're in.

862
01:13:21,839 --> 01:13:22,099
You know.

863
01:13:25,506 --> 01:13:34,688
When you're talking about the AP warrant, that's what you want to see, which all the bills that get paid every week.

864
01:13:36,769 --> 01:13:38,769
All right, how many years do you want that for?

865
01:13:38,789 --> 01:13:38,769
2005.

866
01:13:40,950 --> 01:13:41,850
We can stop there.

867
01:13:41,870 --> 01:13:43,530
2020 to the present is what we request.

868
01:13:43,550 --> 01:13:44,111
All right, that's okay.

869
01:13:50,412 --> 01:13:52,313
Now I understand exactly what you're looking for.

870
01:13:52,473 --> 01:13:57,356
And I'm sorry to take my frustration out on you, but there's a mayor in this, there's a mayor in this building, right?

871
01:13:57,776 --> 01:14:01,137
And we send these papers to her and they just sit there and they don't move.

872
01:14:01,358 --> 01:14:02,198
They just sit on the desk.

873
01:14:02,238 --> 01:14:06,120
All right, so I show up here and I try to do my job as hard as I can.

874
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:09,422
I try, I really do, but I can't do it if I don't have the tools.

875
01:14:09,662 --> 01:14:10,662
I can't build a house with a saw.

876
01:14:10,682 --> 01:14:17,606
I understand your frustration and I will work with the mayor to get this documentation to you.

877
01:14:18,466 --> 01:14:19,827
Because if there's a holdup,

878
01:14:20,572 --> 01:14:23,054
My issue with this whole thing is procedural.

879
01:14:23,174 --> 01:14:26,716
I need to know exactly what you need to see when you need to see it.

880
01:14:26,936 --> 01:14:29,418
And I'm not completely clear.

881
01:14:29,498 --> 01:14:36,122
We're not having a good... Has the mayor's office ever called you and said, this is what they're looking for?

882
01:14:36,802 --> 01:14:36,982
No.

883
01:14:37,283 --> 01:14:44,007
Has the chief of staff ever called you and said, this is what they're looking for?

884
01:14:45,028 --> 01:14:48,730
Has the law department ever called you and said, the city council has asked us to draft

885
01:14:52,665 --> 01:14:53,906
No, the law department's never called me.

886
01:14:53,926 --> 01:14:57,788
So the law department hasn't called you, the chief of staff hasn't called you, the mayor's office hasn't called you.

887
01:14:58,029 --> 01:15:02,372
But this council's taking at least a dozen affirmative votes to get this information.

888
01:15:08,195 --> 01:15:15,140
But then tonight, we have a paper before us to create another new job and give somebody else another raise.

889
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:19,183
I mean, come on.

890
01:15:24,327 --> 01:15:25,087
Thank you, Councilor Newton.

891
01:15:25,147 --> 01:15:26,448
Yeah, and just to clarify.

892
01:15:26,508 --> 01:15:29,688
I feel bad that they said you already had to fall on your sword and be a sacrificial lamb.

893
01:15:30,048 --> 01:15:32,289
I'm fine with falling on a sword.

894
01:15:32,309 --> 01:15:33,989
Because we do, we vote on these papers.

895
01:15:34,009 --> 01:15:35,269
They're supposed to go to the administration.

896
01:15:35,289 --> 01:15:39,430
The administration is supposed to send them to the parties that they're about.

897
01:15:39,510 --> 01:15:40,511
So if you're not getting them.

898
01:15:41,011 --> 01:15:42,511
I will make sure that I'm getting them.

899
01:15:42,691 --> 01:15:45,372
And I will make sure that you're getting the information that you need.

900
01:15:45,912 --> 01:15:47,832
Yeah, I can also always, you know, I can reach out.

901
01:15:47,872 --> 01:15:51,113
I can have the clerk reach out after the fact, if it's not getting there.

902
01:15:51,795 --> 01:15:53,997
Point of information.

903
01:15:54,037 --> 01:15:55,398
Thank you, Madam President.

904
01:15:56,419 --> 01:16:01,583
If we could, I think it sounds like we should just get on paper right now what we're asking for.

905
01:16:01,603 --> 01:16:03,204
That would be great.

906
01:16:03,304 --> 01:16:07,027
And part of this is me being new.

907
01:16:07,487 --> 01:16:10,510
I'm not coordinating with the mayor's office.

908
01:16:10,730 --> 01:16:13,372
I mean, new or not, if you're not getting the papers, you're not getting the papers.

909
01:16:13,392 --> 01:16:14,413
So it's not your fault.

910
01:16:15,594 --> 01:16:19,557
I don't want to be saying that they're somehow remiss.

911
01:16:20,161 --> 01:16:22,343
It's not exclusive to the finance department, Bob.

912
01:16:22,863 --> 01:16:33,571
It's almost, unless we make the outreach directly, every paper that we submit to the mayor's office to almost any department, we're not getting the response in a timely manner or a complete manner.

913
01:16:33,611 --> 01:16:37,294
So I just want to put that out there and I'm not going to ask you to say that, I'll say it.

914
01:16:39,075 --> 01:16:48,281
The first thing I want to just get on, so yes, I think the first thing we'd really like to see would be the AP warrants from January, 2020 to present.

915
01:16:49,545 --> 01:16:55,027
And I know that's probably a pretty big file, but I think we'd all like to see it electronically and also to be sent to the clerk to be delivered to us.

916
01:16:56,948 --> 01:16:57,188
Okay.

917
01:16:57,888 --> 01:17:01,369
It would simply be these, these are the vendors who are paid this warrant.

918
01:17:01,949 --> 01:17:02,109
Yeah.

919
01:17:02,230 --> 01:17:13,213
And I mean, we can also send you an example of what the previous finance or finance director gave us for specific bills would have to be looked up if you wanted to see a specific bill, but it will say, you know, we paid Joe Schmo $600.

920
01:17:15,522 --> 01:17:16,162
of this account.

921
01:17:16,702 --> 01:17:16,883
Yeah.

922
01:17:17,263 --> 01:17:17,623
Okay.

923
01:17:17,823 --> 01:17:21,004
I can also have the clerk setting when the records are ready.

924
01:17:21,024 --> 01:17:22,985
Control F, find your name.

925
01:17:23,105 --> 01:17:24,965
And you can also see this right now.

926
01:17:25,106 --> 01:17:25,266
Right.

927
01:17:25,286 --> 01:17:31,768
I mean, the other thing we can send you is Alicia Nunley Benjamin did provide us with copies of what we call warrant articles.

928
01:17:31,808 --> 01:17:36,530
And we can provide you an example of that so that you can see what those reports were like.

929
01:17:38,890 --> 01:17:42,752
And then the two things that you said that you have with you tonight, you said you had a quarter one

930
01:17:44,051 --> 01:17:48,534
What are one budget to actual with the votes that you took on the 28th for the general fund and water sewer?

931
01:17:49,114 --> 01:17:51,376
And then the other thing that you said is you have revenue projections.

932
01:17:52,496 --> 01:17:58,900
Well, I have first quarter revenue compared to first quarter revenue from fiscal 2022.

933
01:17:59,420 --> 01:18:00,761
Okay.

934
01:18:01,762 --> 01:18:02,943
It's stuck in my computer.

935
01:18:03,403 --> 01:18:05,704
I can email these files to you if you prefer.

936
01:18:05,804 --> 01:18:06,184
Yeah.

937
01:18:06,445 --> 01:18:11,968
I do have paper copies of this along with the budget stuff along with the vote.

938
01:18:12,448 --> 01:18:14,009
to a copy of the vote that was taken.

939
01:18:14,029 --> 01:18:15,850
Do you have multiple copies?

940
01:18:16,851 --> 01:18:17,111
Oh yeah.

941
01:18:17,351 --> 01:18:20,113
Can you hand them, can you pass them to Larry and he'll get them to us?

942
01:18:20,173 --> 01:18:22,435
Yeah, and I don't mean this to be exhaustive.

943
01:18:22,455 --> 01:18:35,484
I'm sure other counselors are going to have other items, but basically what would be also very helpful is if you could take anything, anything that we request tonight, send them to us in a digital format and the clerk in a digital format, he can provide it to us in a print format.

944
01:18:35,944 --> 01:18:40,387
And then if we can have that, you know, maybe by the end of this week, um,

945
01:18:41,207 --> 01:18:50,329
then we could have a full presentation from you in January, as Councillor Knight had requested, where we've had time to review the documents in advance to ask, have our questions ready.

946
01:18:51,649 --> 01:18:52,209
Okay.

947
01:18:53,070 --> 01:18:58,691
It might also be helpful to go talk to the city clerk and say, hey, can I see a copy of the council tracking sheet?

948
01:18:58,811 --> 01:19:08,593
It says finance director, because there's probably literally 40 requests that we're looking for out of your office over the course of the last year.

949
01:19:09,597 --> 01:19:13,260
All right, well, I apologize that I haven't acted on.

950
01:19:14,562 --> 01:19:15,602
I will follow up with that.

951
01:19:17,164 --> 01:19:19,206
I'm through, thank you.

952
01:19:19,246 --> 01:19:20,066
Thank you, Madam President.

953
01:19:20,086 --> 01:19:27,553
Bob, again, the other person taking the heat and I apologize for that.

954
01:19:27,613 --> 01:19:28,394
It's not fair to you.

955
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:33,701
No, no, and I'm not going to pile on.

956
01:19:33,741 --> 01:19:45,785
I think that we should, you know, I think for preparations purposes, I think that maybe calling for a committee of the whole meeting with Bob, once we have all this information.

957
01:19:46,229 --> 01:19:50,171
so we can sit down and really sink our teeth into these issues.

958
01:19:50,211 --> 01:19:55,894
This is something that, so you understand Bob, something as simplistic as people that are watching understand.

959
01:19:57,595 --> 01:19:59,656
When I was 14, I opened up a checking account.

960
01:19:59,716 --> 01:20:03,418
My dad said, okay, this is how you balance your checkbook.

961
01:20:03,498 --> 01:20:04,858
This is how you spend your money.

962
01:20:05,519 --> 01:20:12,242
And if you don't have, if you have $100 in your account and you want to purchase something for $120, it's telling you you can't.

963
01:20:14,630 --> 01:20:17,652
and you're responsible to control your own finance.

964
01:20:17,772 --> 01:20:27,957
Unfortunately, what we're seeing time after time here, we're getting papers from the mayor, we're getting requests from different counselors about asking for money papers.

965
01:20:28,097 --> 01:20:39,343
And to be honest, I haven't voted for a financial paper and approval in a long time, because I find it very difficult for this body to do their job, not understanding the basic

966
01:20:40,516 --> 01:20:42,157
financial breakdowns of our community.

967
01:20:42,777 --> 01:20:45,218
You were there when we had the tough budget process.

968
01:20:45,638 --> 01:20:47,239
It was horrifying for you being new.

969
01:20:47,799 --> 01:20:52,621
And as we're going through this process, but we haven't gotten one, one paper.

970
01:20:52,641 --> 01:20:55,402
We haven't gotten any information about where we're spending our money.

971
01:20:56,062 --> 01:20:59,603
And here we are, we've got almost January, January one.

972
01:21:00,123 --> 01:21:06,186
So I want the public to know this is the hardship we're feeling the council.

973
01:21:07,386 --> 01:21:08,606
We don't have a city solicitor.

974
01:21:08,667 --> 01:21:09,867
I'm trying to ask questions.

975
01:21:10,398 --> 01:21:13,539
about legal matters and we don't have anybody to turn to.

976
01:21:14,259 --> 01:21:19,461
And I apologize that you have to be here tonight and really be hung out to dry.

977
01:21:19,501 --> 01:21:22,942
I'm curious if the chief of staff is here.

978
01:21:22,962 --> 01:21:26,243
I did see her on the call earlier.

979
01:21:34,006 --> 01:21:34,806
She is on the call.

980
01:21:35,566 --> 01:21:38,427
If I can, can we address the question to her?

981
01:21:39,412 --> 01:21:42,174
Madam Chief of Staff, are you there?

982
01:21:55,715 --> 01:21:56,995
I think it's a simple question.

983
01:21:57,455 --> 01:22:15,543
I know that the chief of staff has been out for legitimate reasons and she hasn't, she just started to ramp back up, but were you familiar that our finance director hasn't received any of this information from this council?

984
01:22:18,965 --> 01:22:21,046
I'm not sure I would phrase it that way.

985
01:22:21,766 --> 01:22:23,207
However, I would state that

986
01:22:24,095 --> 01:22:30,659
Both he and I have been discussing the matter, attempting to work on what specifically it is that the council's looking for.

987
01:22:30,699 --> 01:22:32,540
I think that this is a matter of language.

988
01:22:33,300 --> 01:22:38,463
And I've also been working to try to find out what historically the city council has received.

989
01:22:38,703 --> 01:22:41,045
But again, as you stated, I'm returning from leave.

990
01:22:41,165 --> 01:22:48,309
So this is a matter that's important to myself, the administration, the finance director.

991
01:22:48,329 --> 01:22:51,711
I believe we all intend and want to provide this information.

992
01:22:53,111 --> 01:22:56,893
So I apologize that it hasn't been provided yet and I take responsibility for that.

993
01:23:01,715 --> 01:23:11,360
I'm just curious if a rank and file employee, say in the Medford DPW for a year and a half, failed to provide you with information that you requested, what would happen to them?

994
01:23:14,701 --> 01:23:17,663
President Morrell, through you, I take that as a rhetorical question.

995
01:23:21,439 --> 01:23:22,960
So again, I heard your answer.

996
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:25,201
I don't appreciate the response.

997
01:23:25,221 --> 01:23:29,062
I think that this has been a total lack of disrespect to this council.

998
01:23:29,142 --> 01:23:29,522
We have

999
01:23:50,185 --> 01:23:57,068
We have crises that we're dealing with right now that we're looking at financial support and hoping for some financial support.

1000
01:23:57,708 --> 01:24:00,289
And we don't know where we are financially.

1001
01:24:03,051 --> 01:24:19,498
So to move forward with any of these dog and pony requests and then ask for funding for deeply needed resolves and not having an understanding of where we are financially,

1002
01:24:20,265 --> 01:24:25,307
is very difficult for me as a counselor to make decisions moving the city forward.

1003
01:24:28,948 --> 01:24:37,851
I hope everybody that's watching and understands realizes how dysfunctional this community looks right now.

1004
01:24:40,252 --> 01:24:43,613
There are so many issues that we're seeing that coming across from us.

1005
01:24:44,213 --> 01:24:46,034
And this is so totally embarrassing.

1006
01:24:46,974 --> 01:24:48,054
I'm disheartened right now.

1007
01:24:48,415 --> 01:24:49,495
So Bob, again,

1008
01:24:50,100 --> 01:24:54,061
I apologize for the answer that the chief of staff just gave.

1009
01:24:54,181 --> 01:25:06,426
The understanding is this, we have been asking for money papers, I think, I believe from the day after we had our budget, and we've been trying to get some information, some valuable information of where we're going, what direction we're in.

1010
01:25:07,226 --> 01:25:15,589
We're trying to figure out what, tonight's a very important meeting, there's some resolutions tonight, we're talking about some very important issues, and looking to fund some very important issues.

1011
01:25:16,609 --> 01:25:18,790
But getting the okay from the administration

1012
01:25:19,723 --> 01:25:30,269
to fund papers, and then not understanding where we are, because I believe you were there when the mayor said, as critical as last year's budget was, next year's is gonna be even worse.

1013
01:25:31,150 --> 01:25:43,398
And what puts me on edge right now, Bob, is the fact that we haven't seen anything, and we can't move to support our most neediest members of our community and resolutions that are coming forward.

1014
01:25:43,798 --> 01:25:45,739
So I find this very disheartening.

1015
01:25:46,219 --> 01:25:47,400
I find this very troubling.

1016
01:25:48,017 --> 01:26:05,443
And I don't know how my 16, 17 year old daughter has the ability to run her finances better than what we're seeing with this multimillion dollar corporation called Medford.

1017
01:26:05,743 --> 01:26:11,765
So, and again, I know it's not you Bob, but I have to express my concerns and discuss.

1018
01:26:11,825 --> 01:26:12,345
So thank you.

1019
01:26:12,705 --> 01:26:15,066
Councillors at some point it is going to be me.

1020
01:26:15,126 --> 01:26:16,907
So I'm just to let you know.

1021
01:26:18,108 --> 01:26:19,489
We have had staffing issues.

1022
01:26:19,969 --> 01:26:21,511
Tina's been out, Tyler quit.

1023
01:26:22,231 --> 01:26:25,874
We've got a very, very good person to take over from Tyler.

1024
01:26:25,994 --> 01:26:28,996
She is already working on the 2024 budget.

1025
01:26:30,717 --> 01:26:35,561
We've already had meetings on it with all the department heads.

1026
01:26:36,422 --> 01:26:38,363
So we're working on that right now.

1027
01:26:39,624 --> 01:26:40,785
We got the recap done.

1028
01:26:41,646 --> 01:26:43,047
I'm working on the state reporting.

1029
01:26:43,107 --> 01:26:44,348
So we'll know what pre-cash will be.

1030
01:26:44,608 --> 01:26:46,930
Hopefully we'll have that wrapped up within the next month.

1031
01:26:47,857 --> 01:26:51,258
depending on how much availability they have, they have staffing issues too.

1032
01:26:51,278 --> 01:26:59,239
We were fortunate to get the recap done so quickly because there are people out there too and everybody does their recap at the same time.

1033
01:27:00,100 --> 01:27:02,320
So that's coming along.

1034
01:27:06,281 --> 01:27:11,642
By the end of December, I should, I can do the cash recon for the first half of

1035
01:27:13,461 --> 01:27:21,027
fiscal 2023, which we can send off to CLA and get our revenue replacement number from ARPA for that.

1036
01:27:21,827 --> 01:27:28,352
You also have a much better projection of how much, you know, how much revenue we are actually going to take in in 2023.

1037
01:27:29,793 --> 01:27:31,475
So we are working on all these things.

1038
01:27:31,615 --> 01:27:41,062
I'm doing a lot of cleanup work, especially on all the grant fundings and the CPC, the linkage funds, all of that stuff.

1039
01:27:42,049 --> 01:27:51,733
I'm just trying to get the books back in order to be in a firm foundation from what I'm being able to say, this is what's actually going on.

1040
01:27:52,194 --> 01:27:58,436
I'm sorry for the miscommunications or lack of communications, but we are seriously working on this stuff.

1041
01:27:59,197 --> 01:28:06,160
And I don't wanna be here till two in the morning on June 28th, hashing out a budget, neither do you guys.

1042
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:08,681
So this is all gonna be taken care of.

1043
01:28:11,537 --> 01:28:12,417
well before that.

1044
01:28:14,639 --> 01:28:16,359
That is what's going on right now with us.

1045
01:28:17,560 --> 01:28:18,500
Thank you, Director Dickinson.

1046
01:28:18,620 --> 01:28:19,281
Councillor Collins.

1047
01:28:20,421 --> 01:28:24,883
I just wanted to thank you for coming for us, for having these numbers prepared and for your candor.

1048
01:28:24,903 --> 01:28:38,590
I think we all know that when you took the job here, you didn't sign up for a cakewalk, but we all know how much is on your plates with catching up from our financial backlog, reconciling everything, and we don't want

1049
01:28:39,898 --> 01:28:46,083
you know, your role in getting us up to speed to be any more, you know, painful than it has to be.

1050
01:28:46,143 --> 01:28:49,066
So I'm hoping that, you know, I'm looking forward to the presentation in January.

1051
01:28:49,086 --> 01:28:52,909
I really appreciate, you know, your help in dialing down how to get us what we need.

1052
01:28:53,470 --> 01:29:06,641
And I hope that, you know, at that presentation and the committee of the whole, if we refer it there, we can also at that point kind of assess what do we need going forward to make sure that this back and forth between the council and your offices, you know, having communication-wise what it needs

1053
01:29:07,689 --> 01:29:09,530
just to make sure that that's as streamlined as possible.

1054
01:29:09,570 --> 01:29:10,790
So again, thank you for being here.

1055
01:29:10,810 --> 01:29:12,730
We do really appreciate your hard work.

1056
01:29:13,891 --> 01:29:15,371
Thank you, Councilor Collins.

1057
01:29:15,891 --> 01:29:18,932
Councilor Scavoli, was that a motion to send this to the whole?

1058
01:29:18,992 --> 01:29:28,534
Please, I think until we have all the information in front of us and Bob has time now to get the documentation that we need to move this forward or to understand it.

1059
01:29:29,234 --> 01:29:31,615
I think we need it immediately.

1060
01:29:31,635 --> 01:29:34,756
It's something that, you know, we've been asking for

1061
01:29:36,828 --> 01:29:37,448
forever.

1062
01:29:38,189 --> 01:29:41,291
So thank you, ma'am.

1063
01:29:41,331 --> 01:29:53,660
Just amend the motion to request that the finance director submit to the clerk and the Council in digital format, the documents requested and documents that we listed out earlier.

1064
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:57,942
And I'll leave it at that.

1065
01:29:58,043 --> 01:30:00,844
But I do think we should try to schedule this early in January and try to figure

1066
01:30:03,041 --> 01:30:07,424
Yeah, and I can, I can connect with you Bob, just whenever it's ready, I can get that on the schedule.

1067
01:30:08,885 --> 01:30:14,568
Whenever everything is ready, we can get that on a schedule so I can coordinate with you.

1068
01:30:15,989 --> 01:30:17,050
I'll work with you whenever.

1069
01:30:17,070 --> 01:30:23,173
I'll email you I'll follow up so we can schedule it when you have everything ready.

1070
01:30:23,474 --> 01:30:26,936
So on the motion of Councillor Scarpelli as amended by Vice President Baird seconded by

1071
01:30:31,640 --> 01:30:35,264
Oh, Council I had submitted advance for which.

1072
01:30:36,045 --> 01:30:50,720
So on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli as amended by vice mayor seconded by Councilor Collins, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1073
01:31:02,083 --> 01:31:02,203
Yes.

1074
01:31:02,243 --> 01:31:02,383
Yes.

1075
01:31:02,403 --> 01:31:02,483
Yes.

1076
01:31:02,503 --> 01:31:02,563
Yes.

1077
01:31:02,583 --> 01:31:02,643
Yes.

1078
01:31:02,683 --> 01:31:02,743
Yes.

1079
01:31:03,124 --> 01:31:03,344
Yes.

1080
01:31:04,605 --> 01:31:04,705
Yes.

1081
01:31:04,725 --> 01:31:04,785
Yes.

1082
01:31:04,845 --> 01:31:04,965
Yes.

1083
01:31:04,985 --> 01:31:05,145
Yes.

1084
01:31:05,165 --> 01:31:05,225
Yes.

1085
01:31:05,385 --> 01:31:05,565
Yes.

1086
01:31:05,585 --> 01:31:05,645
Yes.

1087
01:31:05,665 --> 01:31:05,745
Yes.

1088
01:31:06,026 --> 01:31:06,186
Yes.

1089
01:31:06,206 --> 01:31:06,286
Yes.

1090
01:31:06,306 --> 01:31:06,426
Yes.

1091
01:31:06,446 --> 01:31:06,586
Yes.

1092
01:31:06,686 --> 01:31:06,866
Yes.

1093
01:31:06,886 --> 01:31:07,286
Yes.

1094
01:31:07,306 --> 01:31:07,406
Yes.

1095
01:31:07,426 --> 01:31:07,506
Yes.

1096
01:31:07,527 --> 01:31:07,647
Yes.

1097
01:31:07,667 --> 01:31:07,727
Yes.

1098
01:31:07,947 --> 01:31:08,127
Yes.

1099
01:31:08,147 --> 01:31:08,207
Yes.

1100
01:31:08,227 --> 01:31:08,287
Yes.

1101
01:31:08,307 --> 01:31:08,387
Yes.

1102
01:31:08,427 --> 01:31:08,527
Yes.

1103
01:31:08,547 --> 01:31:08,627
Yes.

1104
01:31:08,647 --> 01:31:08,707
Yes.

Yes.

Yes.

1127
01:31:14,011 --> 01:31:14,071
Yes.

1128
01:31:14,111 --> 01:31:14,171
Yes.

1129
01:31:14,231 --> 01:31:14,291
Yes.

1130

Yes.

1131
01:31:14,411 --> 01:31:14,471
Yes.

1132
01:31:14,491 --> 01:31:14,551
Yes.

Yes.

1136
01:31:14,931 --> 01:31:15,111
Yes.

1137
01:31:15,131 --> 01:31:15,211
Yes.

1138
01:31:15,251 --> 01:31:15,432
Yes.

1139
01:31:15,592 --> 01:31:15,832
Yes.

1140
01:31:16,132 --> 01:31:16,192
Yes.

1141
01:31:16,412 --> 01:31:16,512
Yes.

1142
01:31:16,532 --> 01:31:16,592
Yes.

1143
01:31:16,632 --> 01:31:16,732
Yes.

1144
01:31:16,752 --> 01:31:16,893
Yes.

1145
01:31:16,913 --> 01:31:16,973
Yes.

1146
01:31:16,993 --> 01:31:17,073
Yes.

1147
01:31:17,093 --> 01:31:17,153
Yes.

1148
01:31:17,173 --> 01:31:17,233
Yes.

1149
01:31:17,253 --> 01:31:17,313
Yes.

1150
01:31:17,333 --> 01:31:17,393
Yes.

1151
01:31:17,433 --> 01:31:17,513
Yes.

1152
01:31:17,533 --> 01:31:17,613
Yes.

1153
01:31:17,633 --> 01:31:17,713
Yes.

1154
01:31:17,733 --> 01:31:17,853
Yes.

1155
01:31:17,873 --> 01:31:17,993
Yes.

1156
01:31:18,013 --> 01:31:18,113
Yes.

1157
01:31:18,133 --> 01:31:18,193
Yes.

1158
01:31:18,213 --> 01:31:18,333
Yes.

1159
01:31:18,353 --> 01:31:18,434
Yes.

1160
01:31:18,454 --> 01:31:18,554
Yes.

1161
01:31:18,594 --> 01:31:18,654
Yes.

1162
01:31:18,674 --> 01:31:18,734
Yes.

1163
01:31:18,754 --> 01:31:18,854
Yes.

1164
01:31:18,874 --> 01:31:18,934
Yes.

1165
01:31:18,974 --> 01:31:19,034
Yes.

1166
01:31:19,054 --> 01:31:19,114
Yes.

1167
01:31:19,134 --> 01:31:19,194
Yes.

1168
01:31:19,234 --> 01:31:19,294
Yes.

1169
01:31:19,314 --> 01:31:19,394
Yes.

1170
01:31:19,414 --> 01:31:19,494
Yes.

1171
01:31:19,514 --> 01:31:19,634
Yes.

1172
01:31:19,654 --> 01:31:19,794
Yes.

1173
01:31:19,814 --> 01:31:19,894
Yes.

1174
01:31:19,934 --> 01:31:20,015
Yes.

1175
01:31:20,055 --> 01:31:20,215
Yes.

1176
01:31:20,295 --> 01:31:20,375
Yes.

1177
01:31:23,157 --> 01:31:23,297
Yes.

1178
01:31:23,317 --> 01:31:23,417
Yes.

1179
01:31:23,437 --> 01:31:23,537
Yes.

1180
01:31:23,557 --> 01:31:23,617
Yes.

1181
01:31:23,637 --> 01:31:23,717
Yes.

1182
01:31:23,737 --> 01:31:23,817
Yes.

1183
01:31:23,857 --> 01:31:23,917
Yes.

1184
01:31:23,977 --> 01:31:24,077
Yes.

1185
01:31:32,152 --> 01:31:39,699
that occur at Medford High School on Monday, December 19 be a further result of the city council take immediate action to ensure the safety of our children and teachers.

1186
01:31:39,719 --> 01:31:44,082
Thank you, Madam President, appreciate taking this out of order.

1187
01:31:44,102 --> 01:31:46,344
This has been a very

1188
01:31:47,376 --> 01:31:51,679
emotional last 24 hours, it's been very intense.

1189
01:31:52,680 --> 01:32:01,726
And I wanted to make sure that if you allow me to give a small presentation that I prepared, so I don't miss anything.

1190
01:32:04,988 --> 01:32:05,888
Methods in crisis.

1191
01:32:07,229 --> 01:32:15,755
It's not a new crisis, but one that has started to spiral out of control and has just caught the attention of the outside world.

1192
01:32:16,883 --> 01:32:21,726
Sadly, we had many years of warning given to us to prevent the latest incident.

1193
01:32:23,007 --> 01:32:31,673
But as we see today, those warning signs were ignored by the very people that were entrusted to protect our kids by acting on our behalf.

1194
01:32:33,254 --> 01:32:41,520
Most of you know my background as a former coach, teacher, and now Assistant Director of Recreation for Neighborhood Community.

1195
01:32:43,472 --> 01:32:48,937
I want to look at a few fundamentals to see where we missed out, where we made our mistakes.

1196
01:32:50,438 --> 01:32:53,421
First thing that came to me is, are our kids safe?

1197
01:32:54,982 --> 01:32:56,423
No, they're not.

1198
01:32:59,186 --> 01:33:00,987
It's not the data that we need now.

1199
01:33:01,308 --> 01:33:04,310
We now have the actual proof from our experiences.

1200
01:33:05,271 --> 01:33:09,875
Are we doing all that we can to keep our kids safe so they can learn and grow successfully?

1201
01:33:10,756 --> 01:33:10,856
No.

1202
01:33:11,751 --> 01:33:13,732
The warning signs are there and we ignored it.

1203
01:33:16,854 --> 01:33:18,616
Are we unified on this issue?

1204
01:33:19,516 --> 01:33:20,257
Absolutely not.

1205
01:33:21,838 --> 01:33:25,880
Sadly, some people take their responsibility serious while others do not.

1206
01:33:27,782 --> 01:33:38,669
I question the personal motives of some to simply protect their income versus protecting people that got them elected or hired.

1207
01:33:42,342 --> 01:33:50,045
There are outside groups currently bullying elected officials to exercise their views, which do not help to protect our kids.

1208
01:33:51,265 --> 01:33:57,968
National organizations, national movements, while we're having crisis here in our own backyard.

1209
01:33:59,728 --> 01:34:03,610
Is our division hurting our kids and the reputation of our city?

1210
01:34:04,550 --> 01:34:05,711
Yes, that's evident.

1211
01:34:06,711 --> 01:34:09,632
The division in this great community is tragic

1212
01:34:11,424 --> 01:34:18,649
If it continues, we'll just see the first of many situations that will bring our amazing city even further down.

1213
01:34:19,670 --> 01:34:23,593
Now, two heads are better than one, and four heads are better than two.

1214
01:34:24,894 --> 01:34:26,976
Unified, we will overcome together.

1215
01:34:27,896 --> 01:34:33,781
Divided, we will continue the sad, turbulent ride to a much worse place.

1216
01:34:37,063 --> 01:34:40,746
You know, last night I was accused of politicizing this issue.

1217
01:34:43,281 --> 01:34:52,988
My knee-jerk reaction was quickly defended to the categorization of being looked at and politicizing this issue.

1218
01:34:53,929 --> 01:34:54,730
Then I thought about it.

1219
01:34:55,951 --> 01:34:57,572
Of course I'm politicizing this issue.

1220
01:34:58,853 --> 01:35:06,279
Because that's the only way, the only mechanism that we, our kids, and the citizens have to make any changes to our system.

1221
01:35:07,239 --> 01:35:11,963
We live in a political system that requires checks and balances to protect our citizens.

1222
01:35:13,588 --> 01:35:26,537
So being attacked with this term makes no sense and showed me exactly how those that are guilty continue to deflect away from their own inaction, neglect, and responsibilities.

1223
01:35:28,358 --> 01:35:41,647
Well, we've learned that inaction equals action, meaning inaction enabled these outcomes, putting our kids in harm's way and making our parents petrified to send our kids to school.

1224
01:35:43,744 --> 01:35:48,987
That's the atrocity that we are looking at today, right now.

1225
01:35:51,029 --> 01:36:00,074
If anyone has been politicizing this issue, it's those that have been both enabling these outcomes and hiding from the consequences of their own inactions.

1226
01:36:02,075 --> 01:36:04,557
We were elected by the people, for the people.

1227
01:36:05,958 --> 01:36:10,461
It's time that we get to work for the people, especially our children.

1228
01:36:12,082 --> 01:36:12,422
See, when

1229
01:36:13,262 --> 01:36:15,523
We got elected by the people.

1230
01:36:16,724 --> 01:36:19,205
It should not be measured by winning or losing.

1231
01:36:20,025 --> 01:36:25,467
It should be measured by the impact that we make and promises that we keep.

1232
01:36:27,688 --> 01:36:32,050
This is our opportunity that has presented itself to us today.

1233
01:36:32,070 --> 01:36:36,512
The question was presented, what are we going to do about it?

1234
01:36:38,273 --> 01:36:42,835
Here's what I propose to get us united, back on track and protect our kids

1235
01:36:43,299 --> 01:36:45,300
the way that they require from us.

1236
01:36:48,322 --> 01:37:10,094
First, I'm going to be asking the mayor to put together a team so we can put an implementation of safety that works with our teachers, our principals, our police department, so our kids feel safe when they go back on January 3rd.

1237
01:37:12,841 --> 01:37:14,022
We want them to feel safe.

1238
01:37:15,663 --> 01:37:19,446
Meetings, consultants, that's passed.

1239
01:37:20,007 --> 01:37:26,172
We have true professionals in our building that we can work together over the next two weeks to make sure we have that plan in place.

1240
01:37:26,672 --> 01:37:27,313
I'm sure of that.

1241
01:37:30,232 --> 01:37:41,418
I have resolutions in place this evening that would ask the mayor to prepare an RFP to hire and train true security guards, four to five.

1242
01:37:42,238 --> 01:37:58,546
Make sure that we have full staffing in the video room where our staff can watch a minute to minute action and who's going into the bathrooms, who's loitering in the hallways to make sure our administration can see where these issues are happening and get

1243
01:37:59,017 --> 01:38:00,678
the support there as soon as possible.

1244
01:38:02,700 --> 01:38:08,284
Last night, I believe it was Tony Puccio who brought up a very simple resolution.

1245
01:38:09,946 --> 01:38:12,988
We ask our parents today to do everything, to be involved.

1246
01:38:14,669 --> 01:38:16,070
And he mentioned that.

1247
01:38:16,110 --> 01:38:17,111
I thought that was a great idea.

1248
01:38:17,191 --> 01:38:19,713
When I got home, I got a phone call from a former soccer captain.

1249
01:38:20,294 --> 01:38:25,618
She went to school in Tulane, worked in Louisiana, and she sent me an article about

1250
01:38:26,175 --> 01:38:31,677
a program they use in the schools in Louisiana where they were having issues and concerns like we're having today.

1251
01:38:32,557 --> 01:38:33,737
It's called Dads in the Hall.

1252
01:38:34,598 --> 01:38:37,198
Maybe, to be correct, we'll call it Dads and Moms in the Hall.

1253
01:38:38,539 --> 01:38:49,362
If we could put parents on a bus to go to a field trip to Plymouth Rock, then we could put parents in the school that want to assist our teachers to make sure they're just an extra eyes and ears as we walk the halls.

1254
01:38:50,442 --> 01:38:52,363
So I thank you, Mr. Puccio, for bringing that forward.

1255
01:38:53,638 --> 01:39:02,946
I'm going to ask the school committee to open up their meetings for public participation, where there's a dialogue like last evening.

1256
01:39:03,006 --> 01:39:14,597
So if there's an issue with parents, students, or constituents, they have this forum to come and speak with a dialogue back and forth to make sure things are identified.

1257
01:39:15,217 --> 01:39:20,542
The process that's in place right now, as some parents can tell you tonight, very daunting.

1258
01:39:21,148 --> 01:39:34,537
to put it through, to ask to get approval, to read something, to write something up and making sure that what is going to be presented is approved is another form of censorship.

1259
01:39:35,558 --> 01:39:49,928
If not, I'm gonna request this council to go back to the original request that Councilor Knight and I put forth as a ordinance change demanding that we put in place that format for the City School Committee so they have an avenue

1260
01:39:50,918 --> 01:39:53,059
to have a voice and they can listen.

1261
01:39:56,000 --> 01:40:01,243
So this has been a very intense last 24 hours.

1262
01:40:03,804 --> 01:40:11,088
My daughter didn't go to school, nor did I believe close to 400 other students.

1263
01:40:12,088 --> 01:40:15,430
The word back was that the police were there and they were present.

1264
01:40:16,010 --> 01:40:20,072
But we also know that won't happen every single day for the rest of the year.

1265
01:40:21,712 --> 01:40:33,040
So I implore our school committee to work together with the police department to move forward to making sure that there's a plan in place over the next few weeks.

1266
01:40:34,401 --> 01:40:39,806
So we have our children feeling safe.

1267
01:40:42,287 --> 01:40:47,451
And that leaves me with one thing.

1268
01:40:47,491 --> 01:40:49,313
I know that she's not here right now,

1269
01:40:50,025 --> 01:40:57,088
But I want, I heard something last night from a very courageous young lady and I want to leave with something that she said that I take it.

1270
01:40:57,728 --> 01:40:58,568
It was directed to me.

1271
01:40:58,868 --> 01:40:59,748
It's direct to all of us.

1272
01:41:00,469 --> 01:41:04,150
It was very simple to, as she said, step up a step down.

1273
01:41:05,230 --> 01:41:09,612
We have a responsibility and I hope we hear it.

1274
01:41:11,848 --> 01:41:31,222
We have a responsibility to make sure that we're giving the tools to our leaders in the school, our principals and assistant principals, to make sure that they can run the schools as efficient as they did when they led the middle schools or before this administration, when they were part of the resolutions.

1275
01:41:33,064 --> 01:41:35,626
So let's unify this community.

1276
01:41:35,966 --> 01:41:38,068
Let's unify our schools.

1277
01:41:38,831 --> 01:41:47,217
and let's make Medford the city that it's always been, an amazing place to live, work, and raise their family.

1278
01:41:47,898 --> 01:41:48,899
So thank you, Madam President.

1279
01:41:57,425 --> 01:42:01,348
Excuse me.

1280
01:42:01,688 --> 01:42:05,391
I also had a grandchild that went to school today either because of her fear.

1281
01:42:06,962 --> 01:42:21,411
Instead of being here tonight advocating for funding, hiring teachers, school repairs, or asking for supplies, I'm here tonight to add my voice to the groundswell of anger and outrage that so many are feeling regarding the recent violence at Bedford High School.

1282
01:42:21,971 --> 01:42:27,895
So now I am demanding adequate resources, security, to help keep our students safe.

1283
01:42:29,195 --> 01:42:30,536
First off, let's get one thing straight.

1284
01:42:31,417 --> 01:42:33,258
Stabbing yesterday was not an isolated incident.

1285
01:42:34,090 --> 01:42:36,810
Fully has been going on for a long time at the high school.

1286
01:42:37,291 --> 01:42:38,291
Didn't just start yesterday.

1287
01:42:38,311 --> 01:42:45,372
A gun clip found in a middle school auditorium during a school vacation was an isolated incident.

1288
01:42:45,852 --> 01:42:46,512
No one was hurt.

1289
01:42:47,052 --> 01:42:51,173
Gun clips by themselves don't hurt people, but knives and physical violence do.

1290
01:42:52,333 --> 01:42:55,194
Everyone who engages in the community could see this coming a mile away.

1291
01:42:56,034 --> 01:42:59,094
Fully has been escalated, unchecked since the start of the school year.

1292
01:43:01,615 --> 01:43:03,755
But rather than address the situation on early,

1293
01:43:04,313 --> 01:43:10,377
school officials, superintendent, school committee, and the mayor consistently downplayed each and every incident, hoping it would go away.

1294
01:43:11,438 --> 01:43:16,481
It was unconscionable that no comment, acknowledgement, or plan of action was implemented immediately.

1295
01:43:17,362 --> 01:43:18,042
What are we thinking?

1296
01:43:19,323 --> 01:43:21,545
We all know when people aren't thinking.

1297
01:43:22,926 --> 01:43:28,149
Yesterday's school committee meeting was another pointless charade of the council needs to work together and not yell at us.

1298
01:43:28,669 --> 01:43:29,390
Let me tell you something.

1299
01:43:29,690 --> 01:43:31,011
I've been working here for 11 years.

1300
01:43:31,551 --> 01:43:32,752
I've gotten yelled at many times.

1301
01:43:34,303 --> 01:43:36,624
If you can't take getting yelled at, then don't run for office.

1302
01:43:37,804 --> 01:43:41,565
I've been willing to work together with any elected body since the first day I was elected.

1303
01:43:42,425 --> 01:43:43,706
People are justifiably angry.

1304
01:43:44,086 --> 01:43:49,927
It's become quite clear that when the teachers had a vote of no confidence, it was directed to the school committee and the mayor's chair.

1305
01:43:51,568 --> 01:43:59,690
I'm tired of seeing my city, Medford, in the media recently, with a glaring negative spotlight now focused on our community.

1306
01:43:59,970 --> 01:44:02,871
It's evident that we're not ready for this prime time.

1307
01:44:03,868 --> 01:44:11,715
I was astonished to hear our superintendent say on television last night, we don't encourage bringing weapons to school, encourage.

1308
01:44:12,896 --> 01:44:14,658
Statement I find boggles to say at least.

1309
01:44:15,158 --> 01:44:30,172
How about zero tolerance statement for any weapons and violence of any kind, and we'll act swiftly and with determination to eradicate this unacceptable behavior and prosecute anyone who violates this policy to the fullest extent of the law.

1310
01:44:32,100 --> 01:44:33,921
That's what our superintendent should have said.

1311
01:44:34,761 --> 01:44:35,802
Here's another mind twister.

1312
01:44:36,742 --> 01:44:39,324
Biffin High has no expulsion policy or program in place.

1313
01:44:40,044 --> 01:44:41,165
What measures does it send?

1314
01:44:42,786 --> 01:44:46,408
Do you want, and don't worry, you won't get kicked out of school.

1315
01:44:46,768 --> 01:44:48,749
After all, everyone is entitled to an education.

1316
01:44:50,170 --> 01:44:52,571
No, not if they're a danger to this community.

1317
01:44:52,991 --> 01:44:55,612
And all this begs the question, where is the mayor in all this?

1318
01:44:56,193 --> 01:44:58,734
I hope this just goes away, not showing leadership.

1319
01:44:59,074 --> 01:45:00,515
That's not a surprise to me here either.

1320
01:45:01,820 --> 01:45:02,921
So where do we go from here?

1321
01:45:03,862 --> 01:45:09,546
First, keep the police present in our high school indefinitely.

1322
01:45:09,566 --> 01:45:11,247
392 students called out today.

1323
01:45:11,648 --> 01:45:15,370
Students, teachers, and parents demand a safe learning environment.

1324
01:45:15,731 --> 01:45:16,591
This is a first step.

1325
01:45:17,172 --> 01:45:24,077
Bring in counselors to talk to our affected students and ensure them that the situation now finally is being addressed.

1326
01:45:25,198 --> 01:45:30,182
Schedule multiple listening sessions for parents and community members to express their feelings and vent.

1327
01:45:31,264 --> 01:45:34,466
Give them your absolute promise that this ends now.

1328
01:45:36,087 --> 01:45:39,589
Go through the school incident logs and put problem students on the notice immediately.

1329
01:45:41,170 --> 01:45:43,972
Again, it's an insult to say this was an outside incident.

1330
01:45:44,332 --> 01:45:52,897
The kids at the school have seen a growing power vacuum of non-discipline with the recent bully and failing body to act up themselves.

1331
01:45:53,597 --> 01:45:55,658
It's copycat pure violence and simple.

1332
01:45:56,419 --> 01:45:59,761
Lastly, hold yourself accountable and admit that

1333
01:46:00,731 --> 01:46:03,132
You minimize the problem instead of deflecting the blame.

1334
01:46:04,172 --> 01:46:05,753
That's the only way to move forward from this.

1335
01:46:05,793 --> 01:46:10,395
The principal and superintendents should put a clear professional plan in place to start 2023 right.

1336
01:46:10,975 --> 01:46:13,236
We owe it to our children and their future.

1337
01:46:14,377 --> 01:46:22,280
We can fix mistakes that were made, but if someone loses their life due to needless violence, that's not a mistake that anyone can fix.

1338
01:46:23,760 --> 01:46:27,822
I'm proud to be a graduate of Bedford High School and I have many fond memories of my time there.

1339
01:46:28,522 --> 01:46:30,443
What kind of memories are these children gonna have

1340
01:46:30,813 --> 01:46:32,793
for the eight years at Medford High.

1341
01:46:33,274 --> 01:46:35,014
We can change that, but we've got to act now.

1342
01:46:36,935 --> 01:46:37,175
Thank you.

1343
01:46:53,303 --> 01:47:05,190
First of all, I'd like to thank Councilor Scott Kelly and Councilor Caviello for being outspoken in their efforts to raise awareness as to what's going on in our schools.

1344
01:47:06,711 --> 01:47:12,475
Neither one of these gentlemen were required to appear for the school committee meeting last night.

1345
01:47:12,695 --> 01:47:20,740
They did so as concerned parents, grandparents, and public servants here in the city.

1346
01:47:21,860 --> 01:47:39,924
And when I listen to what they say, and I listen to what people on the street say, and when I listen to what my kids say, and I listen to what my wife has to say about these public schools as an educator at 25 years in a neighboring school district, it doesn't make me feel good.

1347
01:47:41,105 --> 01:47:42,265
It doesn't make me feel good at all.

1348
01:47:44,165 --> 01:47:46,706
I feel as though we're failing our students.

1349
01:47:48,306 --> 01:47:53,308
We're failing the most vulnerable members of our population, our children.

1350
01:47:55,749 --> 01:47:57,209
Councilor Scott Pelly made a good point.

1351
01:47:58,530 --> 01:48:00,010
He said, it's the one year anniversary.

1352
01:48:00,891 --> 01:48:01,811
I said, one year anniversary?

1353
01:48:01,831 --> 01:48:03,692
Are you talking about one year anniversary or what?

1354
01:48:04,292 --> 01:48:04,972
One year anniversary.

1355
01:48:04,992 --> 01:48:07,293
It's December, Christmas hasn't happened yet.

1356
01:48:07,313 --> 01:48:08,494
I go, one year anniversary or what?

1357
01:48:09,094 --> 01:48:13,275
He goes, no, you don't remember the two walkouts that happened last year?

1358
01:48:15,136 --> 01:48:17,637
The two walkouts at Medford High School that happened last year?

1359
01:48:18,586 --> 01:48:34,553
because of escalating violence in our public schools, when hundreds of children, hundreds of our students, our kids, our neighbors' children, our families got up out of their seats and they walked out of the school because they said, we can't take it anymore.

1360
01:48:34,574 --> 01:48:35,154
We've had enough.

1361
01:48:38,515 --> 01:48:40,176
Here we are exactly one year later.

1362
01:48:42,157 --> 01:48:43,318
I don't think we're in a better place.

1363
01:48:44,978 --> 01:48:46,119
I think we're in a worse place.

1364
01:48:48,134 --> 01:48:49,215
I think we're in a worse place.

1365
01:48:52,177 --> 01:48:55,619
We're in a place where parents are shut out, don't have the opportunity to speak.

1366
01:48:58,401 --> 01:49:00,562
We're in a place where our kids are afraid to go to school.

1367
01:49:01,723 --> 01:49:04,725
And I think we all know what happens when kids become afraid to go to school.

1368
01:49:06,766 --> 01:49:09,228
We've all seen the documentaries on how gangs are formed.

1369
01:49:10,068 --> 01:49:16,653
We've all heard the stories about kids that get bullied in school and then decide to bring weapons because they've had enough and shoot up schools.

1370
01:49:20,170 --> 01:49:22,972
We've all seen this, it's happened in neighboring states.

1371
01:49:23,913 --> 01:49:29,997
Why do we feel as though we're impervious to the same situation or the same circumstances?

1372
01:49:30,017 --> 01:49:31,759
Because we're not, we're not.

1373
01:49:33,740 --> 01:49:35,741
So we're in a place where kids are afraid to go to school.

1374
01:49:37,182 --> 01:49:47,150
And we're also in a place where we see embarrassing news story after embarrassing news story after embarrassing news story in the headlines with the word mentioned.

1375
01:49:48,408 --> 01:49:50,330
And that's a shame because the city is better than that.

1376
01:49:51,711 --> 01:49:52,771
The city is better than that.

1377
01:49:54,353 --> 01:49:55,914
And our kids deserve better than what they're getting.

1378
01:50:00,437 --> 01:50:10,305
There's no accountability that shows it shows in this culture that's permeating our school system is transcending into the classroom.

1379
01:50:12,727 --> 01:50:14,428
And we could all sit here and we can say, this isn't right.

1380
01:50:14,448 --> 01:50:15,109
And this isn't wrong.

1381
01:50:16,215 --> 01:50:17,176
but the data doesn't lie.

1382
01:50:17,536 --> 01:50:18,917
The numbers don't lie.

1383
01:50:19,217 --> 01:50:20,638
So let's talk about the numbers a little bit.

1384
01:50:21,879 --> 01:50:22,920
Let's talk about the numbers.

1385
01:50:22,940 --> 01:50:31,286
42% proficiency in math, 50% proficiency in reading, 240th in the state college readiness index, 181st in graduation rate and 184th overall.

1386
01:50:31,306 --> 01:50:32,166
Our kids deserve better.

1387
01:50:42,074 --> 01:50:43,675
Our kids deserve better than what they get.

1388
01:50:43,695 --> 01:50:46,657
They don't deserve to go to school afraid.

1389
01:50:47,297 --> 01:50:53,021
They deserve to go to school with leaders that are willing to step up and accept the challenge.

1390
01:50:54,302 --> 01:51:04,928
Now, when this incident first happened, I got an email and the email spoke volumes in terms of the culture that's going on with this administration.

1391
01:51:05,089 --> 01:51:08,891
And I have to take a look at it and just mention it because

1392
01:51:09,867 --> 01:51:11,288
I think it really speaks volumes.

1393
01:51:12,228 --> 01:51:14,209
If I can find it and learn how to work this thing.

1394
01:51:26,955 --> 01:51:34,098
This is a confidential and urgent update relative to the circumstances at Medford High School from Dr. Maurice Edward Vincent.

1395
01:51:35,132 --> 01:51:39,694
Our MHS is currently in a stay in place due to a medical emergency.

1396
01:51:40,754 --> 01:51:43,555
A student was stabbed in the restroom and transported to MGH.

1397
01:51:43,655 --> 01:51:45,216
Four students have been identified.

1398
01:51:45,736 --> 01:51:46,916
The police are here working with us.

1399
01:51:47,036 --> 01:51:48,837
We're working on an official communication.

1400
01:51:50,298 --> 01:51:50,938
What's that mean?

1401
01:51:51,638 --> 01:51:53,279
We're working on an official communication.

1402
01:51:54,219 --> 01:51:55,599
You shouldn't have to work on facts.

1403
01:51:55,800 --> 01:51:57,000
You shouldn't have to work on truth.

1404
01:51:57,620 --> 01:52:02,462
You shouldn't have to work on anything other than telling the people what happened and what you're gonna do to prevent it from happening again.

1405
01:52:03,729 --> 01:52:17,020
Here we are 60 days ago, two short months ago, two short months ago, a girl was assaulted, terribly assaulted, captured on video, broadcast all across the local news stations.

1406
01:52:17,400 --> 01:52:20,042
This poor girl has to go to school every day, shake it in her boots.

1407
01:52:20,563 --> 01:52:32,112
If it weren't for the strength of her parents, if it weren't for the strength of her parents coming up here week after week, day after day, fighting to raise awareness about these issues,

1408
01:52:33,480 --> 01:52:34,181
It would have gone away.

1409
01:52:34,801 --> 01:52:38,744
And then 60 days later, we would have been talking about this gentleman that got assaulted and stabbed.

1410
01:52:39,625 --> 01:52:40,746
And then it would have gone away.

1411
01:52:41,967 --> 01:52:43,888
And then 60 days later, something else would happen.

1412
01:52:44,509 --> 01:52:46,791
And we'd bring it up again, and we'd start talking about it.

1413
01:52:47,691 --> 01:52:48,652
Let's get serious about it.

1414
01:52:49,053 --> 01:52:49,313
All right?

1415
01:52:49,853 --> 01:52:50,534
It's been a year.

1416
01:52:51,034 --> 01:52:53,736
It's been a year since the students in that school told us they've had enough.

1417
01:52:54,897 --> 01:52:58,060
It's been a year since they all got up out of their desks and had the courage to walk out.

1418
01:52:58,700 --> 01:52:59,021
All right?

1419
01:52:59,701 --> 01:53:02,023
They had more courage than the adults in the building.

1420
01:53:07,915 --> 01:53:13,298
And now they have to have more courage than the adults in the building to go to school because they're scared for their safety.

1421
01:53:14,659 --> 01:53:15,380
This is sickening.

1422
01:53:16,280 --> 01:53:17,041
This is sickening.

1423
01:53:17,641 --> 01:53:22,884
And nothing anybody can say when they come up to this podium, all right, is gonna change the way I feel about it.

1424
01:53:23,825 --> 01:53:26,667
The way it's been handled is horrible, horrible.

1425
01:53:26,687 --> 01:53:28,128
These aren't isolated incidents.

1426
01:53:28,948 --> 01:53:33,231
A year ago, one year ago, the whole school said we've had enough and they walked out.

1427
01:53:33,851 --> 01:53:36,073
This is not an isolated incident.

1428
01:53:37,031 --> 01:53:43,894
And the longer we keep approaching this situation as an isolated incident, the more isolated incidents are going to occur.

1429
01:53:46,455 --> 01:53:50,056
And then when the budget comes around, we're going to hear the school department cry poor mouth.

1430
01:53:50,556 --> 01:53:53,998
Well, everybody wants to go to Minuteman, and everybody wants to go to the charter school.

1431
01:53:54,018 --> 01:53:54,878
Well, yeah, no kidding.

1432
01:53:55,338 --> 01:53:55,979
Why wouldn't they?

1433
01:53:55,999 --> 01:54:00,781
Then you're going to sign your kid up for karate when they're five years old just to go to Method Eye.

1434
01:54:04,862 --> 01:54:06,503
You can pay one way, or you can pay the other.

1435
01:54:08,024 --> 01:54:15,426
You can pay with peace of mind and financially send them to a school where you feel as though they're going to be safe and you're going to receive what you deserve.

1436
01:54:18,326 --> 01:54:21,367
Or you can take the risks and send them to Medford High.

1437
01:54:21,507 --> 01:54:22,987
And that's what parents are going to say to themselves.

1438
01:54:23,007 --> 01:54:27,208
They're going to say, is it worth it to me to spend this money to not have to put up with stuff like this?

1439
01:54:28,168 --> 01:54:31,369
And parents are going to say yes, because I'm a parent that's thinking about it.

1440
01:54:33,990 --> 01:54:36,210
I'm losing faith in the Medford public school system.

1441
01:54:38,757 --> 01:54:39,597
And I hate to say it.

1442
01:54:40,778 --> 01:54:41,498
I hate to say it.

1443
01:54:42,399 --> 01:54:44,720
Because I went to the Hervey School.

1444
01:54:45,240 --> 01:54:46,401
I went to the Brooks School.

1445
01:54:47,562 --> 01:54:48,782
I went to the Hopps School.

1446
01:54:49,242 --> 01:54:50,443
I went to Medford High School.

1447
01:54:51,063 --> 01:54:52,724
I played sports for Bud Kelly.

1448
01:54:53,024 --> 01:54:55,466
I learned about what it's like to have blue and white in my veins.

1449
01:54:55,946 --> 01:55:00,708
I learned about what it's like to be responsible, to want to be someone that gives back to his community.

1450
01:55:01,689 --> 01:55:03,930
And that's why I chose to seek public office.

1451
01:55:04,570 --> 01:55:05,311
And when I sit here,

1452
01:55:06,603 --> 01:55:10,426
and I watch some of my colleagues in government hide under their desk, it infuriates me.

1453
01:55:12,828 --> 01:55:17,732
It's okay to say no sometimes, you know, and it's okay to say yes, but what you have to do is say something.

1454
01:55:19,453 --> 01:55:23,576
You can't stand for anything if you don't know where you stand and what you stand for.

1455
01:55:26,359 --> 01:55:27,219
Thank you, Madam President.

1456
01:55:28,080 --> 01:55:31,102
Thank you.

1457
01:55:32,503 --> 01:55:33,184
Councillor Collins.

1458
01:55:35,352 --> 01:55:36,192
Thank you, President Morrell.

1459
01:55:36,833 --> 01:55:40,914
Um, you know, mostly right now, I, I want to, I know there are community members in the room.

1460
01:55:40,934 --> 01:55:42,895
I want to hear from community members.

1461
01:55:43,735 --> 01:55:49,258
Um, but I just wanted to say at the outset, you know, yesterday's incident was heartbreaking.

1462
01:55:50,418 --> 01:55:55,400
It's traumatizing during an already extremely raw and difficult time.

1463
01:55:55,420 --> 01:56:00,162
Um, these events affect the whole community as leaders.

1464
01:56:00,242 --> 01:56:02,563
I think it's our responsibility to hear from people who are

1465
01:56:02,997 --> 01:56:05,559
the most affected, the students, the families, teachers and staff.

1466
01:56:05,579 --> 01:56:13,505
I think we can all agree nothing is more important than our public schools being safe and stable and supportive for everybody who has to be inside of them.

1467
01:56:13,525 --> 01:56:15,407
I think that's a really shared goal.

1468
01:56:16,407 --> 01:56:20,451
And I think this heartbreak is shared that our schools are not safe.

1469
01:56:21,031 --> 01:56:21,772
They're not secure.

1470
01:56:21,952 --> 01:56:22,953
They don't feel supportive.

1471
01:56:23,913 --> 01:56:25,915
And, you know, in this conversation,

1472
01:56:26,388 --> 01:56:28,189
You know, I want to hear from the people most affected.

1473
01:56:28,229 --> 01:56:31,190
That's the folks who go to the schools every day and the people who love them.

1474
01:56:32,730 --> 01:56:40,133
As, as we mentioned, you know, many counselors, myself included, have papers later on the agenda for ways that this council can act within its power to try and be part of the solution.

1475
01:56:41,734 --> 01:56:43,395
You know, we'll, we'll get into more of that later.

1476
01:56:44,555 --> 01:56:48,256
It's, it's deeply troubling that we have to be having this conversation.

1477
01:56:48,476 --> 01:56:54,799
I'm just, it's, it's hard to put into words, you know, how to express sympathy for

1478
01:56:55,430 --> 01:56:58,711
something so painful that's happened to kids just going to school and their families.

1479
01:57:00,051 --> 01:57:04,953
It's, you know, it's a sorry thing, the events that precipitated this discussion, but we have to have it and we're gonna have it.

1480
01:57:07,413 --> 01:57:10,414
You know, Councilor Scarpelli and others were calling for urgent action.

1481
01:57:11,054 --> 01:57:14,735
We're calling for the council to act within its purview to try and be part of the solution.

1482
01:57:15,596 --> 01:57:18,456
And I completely agree, completely agree.

1483
01:57:19,157 --> 01:57:22,197
You know, we have to use our powers as city councilors to try and be part of the solution.

1484
01:57:23,138 --> 01:57:24,438
We aren't the school committee.

1485
01:57:25,147 --> 01:57:26,148
We can't be the school committee.

1486
01:57:26,748 --> 01:57:30,050
We can't make the type of the decisions that the school committee is empowered to make.

1487
01:57:30,890 --> 01:57:44,018
We can use the powers that we have as the city council to try to direct resources where they need to go, to try to be a part of the community-wide conversation, to emphasize the voices of the folks that are most affected by this, to listen to the people who know best where those resources need to go.

1488
01:57:45,118 --> 01:57:47,840
And I'm glad that we get to be a part of that conversation.

1489
01:57:47,880 --> 01:57:51,742
I hope that going forward, this can be more collaborative

1490
01:57:52,073 --> 01:57:55,395
that we can all do our specific roles, but in concert with each other.

1491
01:57:55,415 --> 01:58:06,480
And lastly, since Councilor Scarpelli's resolution calls for public input, if anybody's here to give input, I just want to acknowledge that not everybody does feel comfortable speaking in public, especially on live TV.

1492
01:58:06,520 --> 01:58:07,481
It's not for the faint of heart.

1493
01:58:08,221 --> 01:58:14,804
And also not every comment, especially when kids and school security is involved, is best said in a public setting.

1494
01:58:15,425 --> 01:58:20,267
I just want to restate for the record, whether we're in session or not, I'm available.

1495
01:58:20,899 --> 01:58:26,023
to any resident, to any constituent, to field ideas, to hear your questions.

1496
01:58:26,083 --> 01:58:31,608
If you just need a listening ear, if you don't feel comfortable speaking tonight, you can always reach out to me.

1497
01:58:32,149 --> 01:58:33,029
We're available.

1498
01:58:34,090 --> 01:58:37,993
So I just wanted to say that at the outset of any community input.

1499
01:58:38,234 --> 01:58:38,614
Thank you.

1500
01:58:39,275 --> 01:58:40,956
Thank you, Councilor Collins.

1501
01:58:40,976 --> 01:58:41,917
Vice President Behrs.

1502
01:58:43,658 --> 01:58:44,479
Thank you, Madam President.

1503
01:58:47,041 --> 01:58:48,002
Nobody's happy.

1504
01:58:49,992 --> 01:58:51,753
There's disagreements about this.

1505
01:58:52,514 --> 01:58:54,255
I don't think there's any single person.

1506
01:58:54,275 --> 01:58:58,999
And if there is, they got to get checked out who was happy about what happened yesterday.

1507
01:58:59,019 --> 01:59:14,152
I think everyone agrees and agreed six months ago, or two months ago, or two days ago, that there are things that need to be improved, that there are problems that need to be solved, that we're not

1508
01:59:15,640 --> 01:59:23,542
always, and even if we had solved them, that we're not always going to get it 100% right 100% of the time.

1509
01:59:27,063 --> 01:59:37,165
Now, how we address those problems, how we build processes, how we improve systems, how we address systemic challenges, is by putting forward solutions.

1510
01:59:39,006 --> 01:59:44,947
The thing that we're talking about in resolutions coming later than this are some ideas around that.

1511
01:59:47,291 --> 02:00:13,504
But I think also it's important to look back at what we've heard from our school committee and school administration, what we've heard from this council, when it comes to the budget and the funding of our schools, when it comes to the resources that we need, when it comes to the resources that we need in this moment, when we know, hey, there was violence at Medford High School when I was there.

1512
02:00:14,064 --> 02:00:15,905
There was violence at Medford High School 30 years ago.

1513
02:00:16,809 --> 02:00:18,150
And we can talk about certain numbers.

1514
02:00:18,590 --> 02:00:23,114
The one number that hasn't been talked about any of this is actually looking at the trends and data on this issue.

1515
02:00:24,435 --> 02:00:35,263
But the one thing we do know is whether it's Medford or a neighboring community or every community in Massachusetts or every community in this country is that student supports are deeply needed.

1516
02:00:35,523 --> 02:00:37,585
That mental health is a serious issue.

1517
02:00:37,925 --> 02:00:43,849
That conflict resolution and addressing problems in a peaceful manner is a huge problem.

1518
02:00:44,610 --> 02:00:45,991
And that quite frankly,

1519
02:00:47,172 --> 02:00:49,933
Before these things got worse, it was a problem.

1520
02:00:50,134 --> 02:00:51,714
It's an even worse problem now.

1521
02:00:52,195 --> 02:00:54,276
Students are walking out because they recognize it.

1522
02:00:54,696 --> 02:00:58,538
Students are crying out because they know that they need help or they know someone who needs help.

1523
02:00:59,438 --> 02:01:00,639
It's a question of resources.

1524
02:01:01,879 --> 02:01:06,402
The first thing I thought about when I ran for office was the funding for our schools three years ago, that was before the pandemic.

1525
02:01:06,942 --> 02:01:15,166
It was my first concern in June when we were talking about the fiscal 23 budget and the $2.8 million that got cut from our schools at the last minute.

1526
02:01:17,263 --> 02:01:27,792
two weeks ago, it was again, where I was focusing my energy and efforts in a resolution that passed this council about funding and asking what are the supports?

1527
02:01:27,812 --> 02:01:28,973
What are the funding that's needed?

1528
02:01:30,574 --> 02:01:35,338
Another thing that needs resources and funding, we were just talking about it for municipal vulnerability plan.

1529
02:01:35,378 --> 02:01:36,359
We're just talking about it.

1530
02:01:37,379 --> 02:01:45,386
When we talk about this whole city, schools and city side communications and engagement, the city doesn't invest its budgetary resources in that issue.

1531
02:01:45,906 --> 02:01:46,527
So we have

1532
02:01:47,922 --> 02:01:52,645
you know, people scrambling to put something together to get it out when there's an emergency situation.

1533
02:01:53,345 --> 02:02:00,429
We have in a million other situations insufficient resources for communication and engagement.

1534
02:02:02,130 --> 02:02:05,212
So all of these things, no one is happy here.

1535
02:02:06,092 --> 02:02:08,714
We've all identified problems that we want to solve.

1536
02:02:09,214 --> 02:02:11,075
We're starting to talk about solutions.

1537
02:02:11,836 --> 02:02:15,418
The big elephant in the room solution that we don't want to zone in on

1538
02:02:16,062 --> 02:02:19,603
is that we don't have the resources to address the scope of the problems that we have.

1539
02:02:20,443 --> 02:02:40,127
And until we are willing to admit that and engage in a good faith discussion about what is the true scope of resources that we need to invest in our schools and in our community to address the sheer scale of the problems that we have, we're not going to unify or come together or solve these issues.

1540
02:02:41,027 --> 02:02:45,008
And they are of a scope and scale we could not have imagined four years ago.

1541
02:02:46,065 --> 02:02:49,228
So that's the crux of this whole question.

1542
02:02:50,129 --> 02:02:56,355
We come together in government to pool our resources to address our collective problems.

1543
02:02:56,795 --> 02:02:59,458
That is what we do more than anything else.

1544
02:03:00,278 --> 02:03:09,247
And we've clearly identified a collective problem that needs resources and the resources, we are literally unable to put those resources on the table.

1545
02:03:10,396 --> 02:03:25,389
Now, I think there are things that we can do and should do and try to do in the short term, medium and long term with what we have to better target what we have and do the best that we can do with what we have, but that's not going to be enough.

1546
02:03:27,951 --> 02:03:34,737
The other two things I want to talk about here are that we are once again, not going to

1547
02:03:35,216 --> 02:03:49,404
get unified and be on the same page and be able to move forward collectively, unless we are moving on a single set of facts about who has the authority to do what, who has the power to do what, and who sets the rules about what.

1548
02:03:50,705 --> 02:04:00,290
The state and the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education set a number of rules about a lot of the things that we're talking about tonight, or have talked about in previous meetings.

1549
02:04:01,331 --> 02:04:02,912
The state defines the scope.

1550
02:04:03,437 --> 02:04:05,799
of the authority of the school committee and the city council.

1551
02:04:06,540 --> 02:04:13,605
The one place where we truly do have authority is on this fundamental core question of funding and the budget.

1552
02:04:13,885 --> 02:04:15,327
That is where we can partner.

1553
02:04:15,707 --> 02:04:25,955
And I know that there's a resolution from Councilor Scarpelli on that question and a resolution from Councilor Collins and I on that question, because that is where we can most and best engage in this discussion.

1554
02:04:26,936 --> 02:04:31,940
And I don't say that to limit that there may be other things, but that is where our authority and power lies.

1555
02:04:33,592 --> 02:04:43,515
And the last thing I'm gonna say, people aren't gonna be happy about it, and I'm not happy about everything that everyone else has said, so I'm just gonna go ahead and say it.

1556
02:04:44,896 --> 02:04:50,198
I don't know what veiled accusations about national organizations are going to get us anywhere.

1557
02:04:51,398 --> 02:04:58,801
When we have information that is not correct out there about why people are making decisions that they're making, or what decisions have been made,

1558
02:05:00,640 --> 02:05:14,405
the policies and rules that actually exist and are actually being followed or should be being followed, we're never gonna get on the same enough page to move forward in a collective way and really talk about having the community and collaborative conversations that we need to have.

1559
02:05:15,546 --> 02:05:23,329
So, you know, I know that that's the nicest way that I can think of to say what I really wanna say here.

1560
02:05:23,889 --> 02:05:25,790
But when we talk about unity,

1561
02:05:27,384 --> 02:05:30,146
we can't then have the next sentence be something that divides.

1562
02:05:31,907 --> 02:05:50,479
And I think, again, the thing that we can unify around here, maybe it's not the most heartwarming thing to unify around here, is that nobody is happy, there are problems, and we need to identify and move forward on solutions to those problems.

1563
02:05:50,619 --> 02:05:55,062
And I think if we can do that and accept a single set of facts about

1564
02:05:55,855 --> 02:06:07,218
what is truly going on, then we are laying the foundation to have the substantive conversations and make the real actions that we need so that kids in our schools feel safe.

1565
02:06:07,958 --> 02:06:09,878
I know what it was like to not feel safe.

1566
02:06:10,519 --> 02:06:16,520
I stayed home for a whole week from school because I didn't want to get on the bus because I was attacked when I was in middle school, okay?

1567
02:06:16,580 --> 02:06:21,301
And I'm not even equating that to what happened on Monday or what happened to other people, right?

1568
02:06:21,321 --> 02:06:24,122
I experienced that in my family.

1569
02:06:25,447 --> 02:06:44,731
So we can say that there's a monopoly on the feelings here, but we know what we know and we know that what we have to put forward is not sufficient at this moment to address the scope of the challenge that we face.

1570
02:06:45,271 --> 02:06:51,973
And I think the best thing that we can do is to look at the resolutions before us that are solutions focused and ask

1571
02:06:52,940 --> 02:07:10,415
the people most affected the students and teachers on the ground to work with the school committee and the mayor and the school administration and the city council to figure out what we can do in the short term to address funding and what we can do in the long term to make a systemic solution and a systemic approach to make sure that

1572
02:07:10,808 --> 02:07:23,035
we're addressing this issue in two weeks, in two months, in two years, and in two decades, because we heard last night that there were people who felt that 30 years ago to today, things hadn't been fixed.

1573
02:07:23,395 --> 02:07:25,497
So that's all I wanna say on this.

1574
02:07:25,597 --> 02:07:27,838
Beyond that, I'm not gonna speak to this paper anymore.

1575
02:07:28,258 --> 02:07:33,601
I'll speak to the solutions-focused resolutions that we have next, and I'll leave it at that.

1576
02:07:33,641 --> 02:07:34,482
Thank you, Madam President.

1577
02:07:34,622 --> 02:07:34,882
Thank you.

1578
02:07:35,322 --> 02:07:35,903
Councilor Stang.

1579
02:07:36,823 --> 02:07:39,145
Point of information, if I can, Madam President.

1580
02:07:41,365 --> 02:07:43,426
the funding was there for the school system.

1581
02:07:44,446 --> 02:07:49,909
I believe it was probably 80% of the funding that was cut for security over the last four years.

1582
02:07:50,909 --> 02:07:53,871
So the funding was there and the school system cut that funding.

1583
02:07:54,271 --> 02:07:54,591
Thank you.

1584
02:07:55,692 --> 02:07:56,272
Councilor Tse.

1585
02:07:58,993 --> 02:08:00,394
Thank you, President Morrell.

1586
02:08:00,914 --> 02:08:08,497
I think it's important to thank first the teachers and the school staff and the parents who were there

1587
02:08:09,918 --> 02:08:18,203
who are helping the students through the ordeal, who themselves had to deal with the emotional side of everything.

1588
02:08:19,084 --> 02:08:22,586
It's really important not to forget about that.

1589
02:08:23,967 --> 02:08:24,527
This hurts.

1590
02:08:25,048 --> 02:08:26,649
This hurts emotionally.

1591
02:08:26,669 --> 02:08:30,872
It hurts physically.

1592
02:08:30,972 --> 02:08:32,513
It's important to deal with it.

1593
02:08:32,873 --> 02:08:33,713
And it matters.

1594
02:08:34,054 --> 02:08:35,074
It matters to all of us.

1595
02:08:35,154 --> 02:08:38,116
And look, everyone, everyone,

1596
02:08:39,613 --> 02:08:47,477
in this room, everyone online on Zoom is upset, is frustrated, is saddened.

1597
02:08:49,258 --> 02:09:02,286
And I think we all feel sympathy for the experience that our students have had to deal with and continue to have to deal with at Medford High School.

1598
02:09:03,526 --> 02:09:06,148
I will say I am relieved to hear

1599
02:09:06,894 --> 02:09:13,755
that the student is in stable condition, but that doesn't mean that everything is over.

1600
02:09:16,496 --> 02:09:24,158
I really appreciate the talk from counselors of all backgrounds about the importance of finding solutions.

1601
02:09:25,858 --> 02:09:35,880
And I think to that effect, I wanna thank President Morrell and Vice President Behrs for opening up the city council agenda to allow us to put resolutions on the agenda to have this conversation tonight.

1602
02:09:36,740 --> 02:09:45,412
And to allow us to act fast and to allow us to have this conversation tonight to my parents in the room on in on zoom.

1603
02:09:47,934 --> 02:09:54,338
Look, school violence, and I've said this before, and it's in the news, there's tons of research out there.

1604
02:09:54,979 --> 02:09:57,080
It's an international problem.

1605
02:09:57,260 --> 02:09:58,281
It's a domestic problem.

1606
02:09:58,441 --> 02:09:59,382
It's a Medford problem.

1607
02:10:00,783 --> 02:10:03,505
And that actually means that we have to deal with it.

1608
02:10:03,585 --> 02:10:05,346
And we do have to address it here at home.

1609
02:10:06,827 --> 02:10:10,069
School violence has been around for a while.

1610
02:10:11,190 --> 02:10:13,892
Councilor Behrs has spoken to his experience.

1611
02:10:15,057 --> 02:10:16,978
I went to Medford High School just five years ago.

1612
02:10:17,259 --> 02:10:21,161
I know what it's like there.

1613
02:10:21,221 --> 02:10:23,523
And it's a wonderful institution to learn.

1614
02:10:24,043 --> 02:10:26,225
There are blemishes on it as well.

1615
02:10:27,005 --> 02:10:39,034
And this work, these are all issues that school leaders, teachers, students, everyone has been working together to address over the last few years.

1616
02:10:39,514 --> 02:10:42,236
And it's evident that we need to put even more energy towards it.

1617
02:10:43,757 --> 02:10:53,202
And as I've said before as well, until our schools are safe for everyone, for all, we still have more work to do.

1618
02:10:53,863 --> 02:11:00,186
We need to find sustainable solutions, and that means engaging stakeholders from students to parents to teachers.

1619
02:11:00,826 --> 02:11:10,972
I know people aren't gonna like this, but the school committee who have been elected to govern our schools, to oversee our schools, and we need to engage school leaders as well.

1620
02:11:12,002 --> 02:11:17,624
We need to enforce the existing policies on violence and on anti-bullying.

1621
02:11:18,404 --> 02:11:22,286
And we need accountability to make sure that we're enforcing these policies.

1622
02:11:23,926 --> 02:11:33,270
We need to think through the actions that we can take to protect all kids carefully.

1623
02:11:34,155 --> 02:11:42,180
and quickly, I will add, but we need to make sure that they're equitable and reasonable and that they really truly do protect every kid in the classroom and in the hallways.

1624
02:11:44,141 --> 02:12:02,513
I think it's also evidence that there's a major communications problem that we as a city council have been bringing up in the city, the communications problem in the city when it comes to not just in an incident like this, but just in general, getting the message out to residents.

1625
02:12:03,288 --> 02:12:09,212
But when it comes to this incident as well, we need to know.

1626
02:12:09,393 --> 02:12:13,536
And I think President Morrell and I have written a resolution to this effect.

1627
02:12:14,857 --> 02:12:16,998
We need to know about the incident.

1628
02:12:17,018 --> 02:12:18,039
We need to know the details.

1629
02:12:18,059 --> 02:12:20,961
We need to know authority and rules and who has authority over what.

1630
02:12:22,182 --> 02:12:24,584
And we need to prevent misinformation from being spread.

1631
02:12:26,909 --> 02:12:36,778
And school committee members at yesterday's meeting have also acknowledged that as a city, we need to do better on communications and on engaging families as well.

1632
02:12:39,300 --> 02:12:40,301
Councillor Behrs is right.

1633
02:12:40,602 --> 02:12:41,883
The funding problem is real.

1634
02:12:42,003 --> 02:12:47,969
It's one of the reasons why I decided to run for office in the first place, watching the budget conversation years ago when

1635
02:12:49,190 --> 02:12:54,232
We made major cuts to guidance and to mental health and counseling at our schools.

1636
02:12:54,853 --> 02:12:56,333
And now we're seeing the effects of it.

1637
02:12:57,894 --> 02:13:00,735
We need to be serious about that.

1638
02:13:00,855 --> 02:13:05,237
We need to be serious about funding and to realize that there is a funding issue.

1639
02:13:05,978 --> 02:13:13,701
And that effect, that problem is trickling down to our hallways and to our classrooms.

1640
02:13:17,162 --> 02:13:28,050
and that particularly after COVID and after remote learning, there has been an epidemic of poor mental health in the city and in this country.

1641
02:13:28,070 --> 02:13:44,883
I asked the city and the city council joined me in passing a resolution months ago, asking the city to do a general survey on youth mental health and to look at the effects of that and to see what we can do to invest more in it and to prevent

1642
02:13:45,504 --> 02:13:47,046
things like this from happening.

1643
02:13:47,847 --> 02:13:52,493
And it is upsetting as a counselor to see that we haven't done enough on it.

1644
02:13:54,035 --> 02:13:59,302
This council has been responsible in doing that and we have been proactive in addressing youth mental health.

1645
02:14:01,518 --> 02:14:04,860
I want us to do as much as possible, as quickly as possible.

1646
02:14:05,921 --> 02:14:09,624
I think that's something that everyone behind the reel would agree on.

1647
02:14:11,005 --> 02:14:15,829
But I also do wanna make sure that we are creating lasting solutions within our purview.

1648
02:14:16,449 --> 02:14:27,658
I know not everyone will agree with my approach on this issue and my ideas, but I am open-minded to hear more ideas, to hear feedback, both positive and negative.

1649
02:14:29,058 --> 02:14:49,608
And I understand, as Councilor Collins has mentioned, that many members of our community weren't able to make it to this meeting for scheduling reasons, for family reasons, and many members of our community aren't joining us today because they're afraid to talk and talking in public is not for everyone.

1650
02:14:49,628 --> 02:14:56,531
And to those people, my inbox and my voicemail box and my text message inbox is also open to everyone.

1651
02:14:58,133 --> 02:15:15,800
I think it's really important to emphasize that regardless of the tone of this conversation, regardless of the points that people have brought up, regardless of the feedback that we're going to hear, and I think people in our community, there are many, many different ways of thinking about this issue and about the solutions for this issue.

1652
02:15:16,640 --> 02:15:20,302
I think that's been evident to me in the conversations that I've had.

1653
02:15:20,777 --> 02:15:24,359
with neighbors, with residents, with young folks in the last 24 hours.

1654
02:15:25,919 --> 02:15:45,548
I think it's important to acknowledge the differences, but to also acknowledge the points of unity that I think we see on this agenda tonight, because those points of unity, those are the seeds, I think, for more lasting, more substantive policy changes in the future that will better, I think, create a school environment for our children.

1655
02:15:47,409 --> 02:15:48,129
Thank you, Councilor Sang.

1656
02:15:48,369 --> 02:15:49,009
Councilor Scarpelli.

1657
02:15:49,570 --> 02:15:50,370
Thank you, Madam President.

1658
02:15:53,885 --> 02:16:03,012
trying to be restrained and understanding something very simple that I want to share with my fellow counselors that gave their opinions.

1659
02:16:04,073 --> 02:16:04,974
Agree to disagree.

1660
02:16:05,574 --> 02:16:06,695
We've done that many times.

1661
02:16:11,279 --> 02:16:12,240
These are our children.

1662
02:16:13,401 --> 02:16:14,321
They're unsafe.

1663
02:16:14,902 --> 02:16:15,783
They're scared.

1664
02:16:16,803 --> 02:16:18,345
Our teachers are scared.

1665
02:16:21,206 --> 02:16:27,409
to talk about money concerns and money issues should not be even a thought right now.

1666
02:16:29,070 --> 02:16:39,034
The thought and the discussion of 30 years ago, five years ago, is an embarrassment to me for the fact that this is happening.

1667
02:16:39,415 --> 02:16:42,236
This is happening right now.

1668
02:16:44,757 --> 02:16:50,420
When I talk about unifying, I talk about what I said as a national agenda.

1669
02:16:52,155 --> 02:17:00,080
we see and hear the direction that the school committee has gone on many different levels.

1670
02:17:01,161 --> 02:17:13,649
And some school committees, members have called me in the past and just didn't understand that they wouldn't fight if they didn't have their own voice, but to follow this national agenda.

1671
02:17:15,150 --> 02:17:15,931
And as I'm seeing,

1672
02:17:16,975 --> 02:17:38,927
the people that I looked at and trusted and admired, I'm seeing that they're taking not what's important today in our schools, not what's important, our children, not their safety, but to be in this council chamber yesterday and listen to some of these people that truly are aligned with people in this room.

1673
02:17:41,989 --> 02:17:46,111
So these issues are concerning to the community to understand

1674
02:17:47,397 --> 02:17:48,997
that we need to put that away.

1675
02:17:51,058 --> 02:17:57,759
Open our minds and be unified in the fact that the unification is needed for the safety of our children.

1676
02:17:58,439 --> 02:17:59,940
Not what happened five years ago.

1677
02:18:00,820 --> 02:18:02,160
Not what happened 30 years ago.

1678
02:18:03,120 --> 02:18:04,101
What's happening today.

1679
02:18:04,121 --> 02:18:07,661
We're not gonna get the funding we need.

1680
02:18:07,721 --> 02:18:08,322
We know that.

1681
02:18:08,642 --> 02:18:10,042
And that's not gonna change.

1682
02:18:10,082 --> 02:18:14,503
So bringing that up right now is really sad to me.

1683
02:18:15,447 --> 02:18:18,008
That's just a buzzword and a check off.

1684
02:18:19,909 --> 02:18:23,070
So I will tell you, we need movement now.

1685
02:18:24,531 --> 02:18:29,193
We need our school committee, our superintendent to move now.

1686
02:18:29,213 --> 02:18:32,674
I wanna see action now.

1687
02:18:34,215 --> 02:18:37,016
Let's stop, let's hold school off for the next four days, three days.

1688
02:18:37,596 --> 02:18:41,778
Let's bring our teachers into a room with our principals and let's find a solution right now.

1689
02:18:43,462 --> 02:18:45,704
So our kids are safe when it's time to go back to school.

1690
02:18:47,426 --> 02:18:49,288
Because the next few days are going to be useless.

1691
02:18:51,170 --> 02:18:52,351
There's going to be no learning.

1692
02:18:54,474 --> 02:19:00,760
I want to get solutions from groups that are going to work together to make our kids safe on January 3rd.

1693
02:19:02,001 --> 02:19:03,283
Safe when they go back to school.

1694
02:19:06,058 --> 02:19:22,129
So to protect each other because what was said in another forum and how it was presented by this counselor to people on different committees and try to protect what they're doing on the school committee side, I'm not afraid to speak for it.

1695
02:19:22,209 --> 02:19:24,011
Politically, I don't care.

1696
02:19:24,031 --> 02:19:31,016
Our kids are hurting and what people are seeing

1697
02:19:32,245 --> 02:19:38,747
And what they're hearing from the school committee are gender items that aren't protecting or looking at their safety.

1698
02:19:41,667 --> 02:19:43,648
I was questioned that I was part of that school committee.

1699
02:19:45,008 --> 02:19:46,028
And there are legalities.

1700
02:19:47,609 --> 02:19:48,969
And I understood those legalities.

1701
02:19:50,129 --> 02:19:50,709
But you know what?

1702
02:19:51,249 --> 02:19:54,930
When it came to children's safety, George Scott Pelley never swayed.

1703
02:19:55,350 --> 02:19:56,571
I made sure that they were safe.

1704
02:19:58,151 --> 02:20:00,892
I never had this situation when I was on the school committee.

1705
02:20:01,392 --> 02:20:01,832
Thank God.

1706
02:20:04,102 --> 02:20:13,327
But I will tell you, we can bicker back and forth and disagree, but ultimately, that wasn't my intention today.

1707
02:20:13,927 --> 02:20:17,869
My intention is truly look at everybody and say, let's meet now.

1708
02:20:18,330 --> 02:20:19,831
Let's bring everybody together now.

1709
02:20:20,231 --> 02:20:25,894
Let's set a plan that's tangible that we can reach, that we're not gonna get grants from the state.

1710
02:20:25,934 --> 02:20:33,398
We're not gonna get funding from City Hall, but there's ways to get that done right now to make our children feel safe.

1711
02:20:34,915 --> 02:20:35,195
Thank you.

1712
02:20:40,837 --> 02:20:43,197
Any further discussion from the council at this time?

1713
02:20:43,317 --> 02:20:44,218
Madam President, if I may.

1714
02:20:44,458 --> 02:20:45,458
Councillor Nye.

1715
02:20:45,618 --> 02:20:46,258
Thank you very much.

1716
02:20:46,278 --> 02:20:54,360
You know, there's no such thing as a utopian society.

1717
02:20:56,341 --> 02:21:03,223
And I don't think in this instance that throwing money at an issue, and quite frankly,

1718
02:21:03,997 --> 02:21:10,678
given the decision makers who aren't allocating funds properly in the first place, more money to spend.

1719
02:21:10,698 --> 02:21:16,300
I don't think this is going to do anything for those children that need to go to school tomorrow.

1720
02:21:17,400 --> 02:21:23,121
It might help in the long run, but it's not going to do anything for those children that need to go to school tomorrow.

1721
02:21:26,302 --> 02:21:29,642
What this is about is reallocation.

1722
02:21:31,883 --> 02:21:32,503
As of right now,

1723
02:21:33,762 --> 02:21:38,706
The committee needs to live within its means because there is no funding request from the mayor before us.

1724
02:21:39,767 --> 02:21:41,588
So we can jump up and down and say, we want more money.

1725
02:21:41,648 --> 02:21:42,189
We want more money.

1726
02:21:42,209 --> 02:21:43,630
We do that every week about every issue.

1727
02:21:44,670 --> 02:21:59,442
But ultimately right now, the administration hasn't put the paper before this body, which tells me the administration isn't taking it seriously, which would again, move me to the position to say, you have to live within your means and reallocate your funds then to address this issue.

1728
02:21:59,502 --> 02:22:00,743
So what's the plan and what are you going to do?

1729
02:22:02,013 --> 02:22:07,455
And why are our kids going back to school tomorrow if you don't have a plan and you don't know what you're gonna do?

1730
02:22:08,295 --> 02:22:11,357
Quite frankly, I think the school should have been shut down until after Christmas vacation.

1731
02:22:12,637 --> 02:22:15,778
Blanket, sorry, high school's closed until after Christmas vacation.

1732
02:22:16,559 --> 02:22:21,681
In the interest of safety, in the interest of us showing this community that we're serious about the issues that are before us.

1733
02:22:22,541 --> 02:22:24,862
Because a year has gone by and we haven't showed that.

1734
02:22:28,803 --> 02:22:29,624
So, you know,

1735
02:22:31,198 --> 02:22:50,268
Certainly someone that recognizes that there's a need for resources, but I also think that there is room for reallocation of existing funds, existing policies, and existing practices that will improve the safety in our schools.

1736
02:22:51,169 --> 02:22:55,471
Reversing some of the policy decisions that were made over the last year is a good start.

1737
02:22:59,348 --> 02:23:04,150
But again, there's no such thing as a utopian society and there's never going to be enough.

1738
02:23:04,510 --> 02:23:05,230
How much is enough?

1739
02:23:06,111 --> 02:23:07,071
There's never going to be enough.

1740
02:23:07,691 --> 02:23:09,752
There's never, we're never going to reach a point where we say, Oh, we're cool.

1741
02:23:10,052 --> 02:23:10,533
This is good.

1742
02:23:10,753 --> 02:23:12,613
This is enough money for us to do whatever we need to do.

1743
02:23:13,274 --> 02:23:13,514
All right.

1744
02:23:13,614 --> 02:23:14,314
That doesn't happen.

1745
02:23:15,435 --> 02:23:16,175
That doesn't happen.

1746
02:23:16,255 --> 02:23:19,016
Nobody says, I want to make less money next year than I made this year.

1747
02:23:19,536 --> 02:23:20,577
That's just not the way it works.

1748
02:23:21,417 --> 02:23:25,599
So, you know, we can keep throwing money at issues or we can say, where are you allocating this money?

1749
02:23:25,639 --> 02:23:26,359
And is this a good plan?

1750
02:23:27,125 --> 02:23:28,846
Because throwing money at issues doesn't do anything.

1751
02:23:28,866 --> 02:23:31,187
It's not going to fix the problem if we're not spending it in the right place.

1752
02:23:31,527 --> 02:23:34,668
And it's clear that the money we've already provided isn't being spent in the right place.

1753
02:23:35,449 --> 02:23:37,350
So maybe it comes down to a reallocation plan.

1754
02:23:37,630 --> 02:23:41,752
And then what can we do to supplement that reallocation plan, but let them live with the existing means that they have?

1755
02:23:42,292 --> 02:23:49,395
Because quite frankly, it seems like every time something comes up, they just, anything in this community, quite frankly, anytime anything comes up, it's, we don't have any money.

1756
02:23:49,755 --> 02:23:50,716
We don't have any money to do it.

1757
02:23:50,756 --> 02:23:51,696
We don't have any money to do it.

1758
02:23:52,882 --> 02:23:56,425
All right, well, if you don't have any money to do it and it needs to get done, then what's the next thing you got to do?

1759
02:23:56,485 --> 02:23:57,846
You got to reallocate.

1760
02:23:58,567 --> 02:24:00,269
You got to change your game plan up a little bit there, folks.

1761
02:24:00,349 --> 02:24:00,829
You know what I mean?

1762
02:24:01,450 --> 02:24:04,352
It's like Belichick at halftime, you know, change the game plan, win the game.

1763
02:24:05,173 --> 02:24:07,335
We're not changing the game plan at halftime.

1764
02:24:07,515 --> 02:24:17,464
We're not taking a real strong self-assessment as to where we stand and then making adjustments to improve our position.

1765
02:24:20,790 --> 02:24:23,871
I'll be short, the game is rigged.

1766
02:24:25,491 --> 02:24:27,832
We can try to change our game plan as much as we want.

1767
02:24:28,212 --> 02:24:35,634
But when we're talking about city departments and city budgets that in real inflation adjusted dollar terms have less money now than they did in 1980, the game is rigged.

1768
02:24:37,114 --> 02:24:37,895
So that's the first thing.

1769
02:24:38,095 --> 02:24:45,957
I'm not disputing that there are things we could do immediately to bring people together and try to find solutions.

1770
02:24:45,977 --> 02:24:47,477
I think that's exactly what we have on here tonight.

1771
02:24:48,499 --> 02:24:52,540
There are things we could do with short money that could make a big impact and make people feel safer.

1772
02:24:52,560 --> 02:24:53,861
And I think that's what we're asking for.

1773
02:24:54,401 --> 02:25:13,348
But I think the idea that we can fix this whole problem, or that the notion of putting more resources, this is just throwing money at the problem, that we can address a problem that has been persistent, that is growing in scale, that is not just unique to Medford, even though we could do what we can in Medford to find unique solutions with what we have through reallocation and additional resources.

1774
02:25:15,175 --> 02:25:17,977
it's promising something that's unachievable.

1775
02:25:18,838 --> 02:25:24,541
So I agree, let's do what we can now with short money or no money at all to make people feel safer in the schools.

1776
02:25:24,681 --> 02:25:26,562
I completely understand and respect that.

1777
02:25:27,182 --> 02:25:28,343
And I think we have to do that.

1778
02:25:29,043 --> 02:25:36,688
But if we're not, again, if we're not thinking about this in a bigger terms of, you know, when we talk about resources, yeah,

1779
02:25:37,220 --> 02:25:43,262
make people feel safer, I would bet to have some additional resources around the hallways and the bathrooms, because that's clearly been a problem.

1780
02:25:43,322 --> 02:25:45,943
It was a problem that came up before what happened yesterday.

1781
02:25:46,543 --> 02:25:47,904
Obviously it was a problem yesterday.

1782
02:25:47,964 --> 02:25:49,624
That's something that'll make people feel safer.

1783
02:25:50,004 --> 02:25:52,265
And we can figure out ways to target resources to do that.

1784
02:25:53,525 --> 02:26:06,310
But when we talk about students' mental health and the mental health crisis and the fact that we need dozens of more counselors at our school, or we need to bring back maybe an assistant principal at the high school, or we have to look at the funding cuts that were made in 2020,

1785
02:26:07,582 --> 02:26:08,442
or 2023.

1786
02:26:09,842 --> 02:26:25,826
Those are big ticket items that, you know, if we just want to say we'll never get there, then all we're going to do is the short money things that make people feel a little bit safer until they don't work anymore, or until more kids are facing issues with mental health and conflict resolution.

1787
02:26:26,506 --> 02:26:29,427
I'm going to stop there, because I don't think it's mutually exclusive.

1788
02:26:29,947 --> 02:26:34,828
I'm not saying we can only do one piece of it and not the other and I don't think anyone else is saying the other way around.

1789
02:26:36,387 --> 02:26:52,936
If we don't have that conversation and admit that, we're not going to be operating on a set of facts and under the urgency that we need to be operating under to bring the solutions to bear that we obviously all agree need to be brought to bear.

1790
02:26:52,956 --> 02:26:54,097
Thank you.

1791
02:26:54,357 --> 02:26:54,937
Councilor Collins.

1792
02:26:56,498 --> 02:26:57,478
Thank you, President Morrell.

1793
02:26:57,518 --> 02:26:59,680
And I'm speaking off the cuff here.

1794
02:26:59,720 --> 02:27:03,962
So I just wanna say, I think that what the community deserves

1795
02:27:05,088 --> 02:27:11,229
today in the aftermath of yesterday's events, in the aftermath of other traumatic, tragic events.

1796
02:27:11,450 --> 02:27:20,352
What the community deserves is a communicative, collaborative city council.

1797
02:27:20,752 --> 02:27:27,693
They deserve clear communication, resolve to work together productively from all their elected leaders.

1798
02:27:28,714 --> 02:27:30,534
We owe our community better than infighting.

1799
02:27:31,234 --> 02:27:34,495
You know, we've disagreed on many things many times before,

1800
02:27:35,258 --> 02:27:37,759
Behind this rail, it'll happen again.

1801
02:27:38,139 --> 02:27:39,280
That's what we're here to do.

1802
02:27:40,200 --> 02:27:43,821
We're here to represent different viewpoints for perspective on issues.

1803
02:27:43,841 --> 02:27:50,744
We're here to represent different viewpoints for how to craft strategy and how to respond to problems in our community and how to plan for the future.

1804
02:27:51,964 --> 02:28:04,049
But I think that we owe today, especially today and all days, we owe the community a productive use of our time, discussing available strategies for what we can do within our powers

1805
02:28:04,502 --> 02:28:06,523
to try to deal with the problems before us.

1806
02:28:07,364 --> 02:28:25,996
I, you know, what, what looks like a buzzword to one counselor might be somebody else's best good faith, earnest approach at doing something that is within our power, within our purview to try to address specifically a problem that exists.

1807
02:28:26,596 --> 02:28:27,797
It's put forth in good faith.

1808
02:28:27,897 --> 02:28:29,218
And I think that tracks both ways.

1809
02:28:29,358 --> 02:28:32,080
I don't think it's productive for us to launch into

1810
02:28:35,190 --> 02:28:36,791
veiled personal attacks.

1811
02:28:38,232 --> 02:28:39,813
I don't want that to be what tonight is.

1812
02:28:39,833 --> 02:28:41,394
I think that we have to come together.

1813
02:28:41,715 --> 02:28:43,916
We have to discuss the strategies that we've put forth.

1814
02:28:44,236 --> 02:28:50,181
We might not agree on all of them, but what our community is calling out for is a good faith, earnest discussion of strategies.

1815
02:28:51,241 --> 02:29:01,488
It does our community no good to spill a lot of ink and spill a lot of airtime, fighting about things that we cannot control.

1816
02:29:01,749 --> 02:29:03,550
The community deserves better than a performance.

1817
02:29:04,091 --> 02:29:07,493
we need to discuss strategies that we have the capacity to enforce.

1818
02:29:07,973 --> 02:29:12,135
And sometimes we will disagree about what those best strategies are, but that's what our time should be for.

1819
02:29:12,536 --> 02:29:18,519
So I have a rationale for why I brought the strategies that I think are most important to talk about here.

1820
02:29:18,539 --> 02:29:20,700
I know those feelings aren't universally shared.

1821
02:29:20,720 --> 02:29:25,523
I'll save that for when those papers are brought up, but I really hope that we can maintain just

1822
02:29:26,579 --> 02:29:33,963
clear communication and sticking to the issues at hand and striving for concrete strategies for as much of this evening as possible, because that's what the community needs from us.

1823
02:29:34,284 --> 02:29:34,564
Thank you.

1824
02:29:34,584 --> 02:29:36,665
Thank you, Councillor Collins.

1825
02:29:36,765 --> 02:29:40,507
And I do believe the intent of the resolution is to open it up for public participation.

1826
02:29:40,527 --> 02:29:43,449
So I want to see if there's any further discussion from the council, but I want to make sure

1827
02:29:44,082 --> 02:29:45,182
we move forward to that.

1828
02:29:45,682 --> 02:29:50,724
Seeing none, I just want to just briefly, Councilor Scarpelli, I absolutely hear your calls for unity.

1829
02:29:50,744 --> 02:29:51,964
I hear everyone's calls for unity.

1830
02:29:52,064 --> 02:29:58,446
And I believe that the council is absolutely unified and that no one wanted yesterday to happen.

1831
02:29:58,966 --> 02:30:01,347
No one wanted the incident two months ago to happen.

1832
02:30:01,427 --> 02:30:04,968
No one wanted any student to get hurt in our schools ever.

1833
02:30:05,848 --> 02:30:06,868
Schools should be a refuge.

1834
02:30:07,108 --> 02:30:12,690
We talk about a lot of these issues go beyond the schools, that a lot of these issues start at home because of course they do.

1835
02:30:13,208 --> 02:30:17,750
but every student deserves the opportunity to go to school and feel safe.

1836
02:30:17,870 --> 02:30:23,593
And I know every member of this council, every person in the chambers, every person on Zoom, I know they feel that.

1837
02:30:24,373 --> 02:30:38,320
So I hope that we can continue to have this talk and come to solutions so that students can feel safe, so that parents can feel comfortable sending their kids to school, and so that teachers can have the space to do their jobs and do what they do best.

1838
02:30:39,519 --> 02:30:41,340
So I'm going to open it up to public participation.

1839
02:30:42,001 --> 02:30:46,284
Before we go to that, I do just want to note public participation is just that, it is to hear from the public.

1840
02:30:46,464 --> 02:30:47,584
It is not meant to be a debate.

1841
02:30:48,805 --> 02:30:51,627
No personal tax will be permitted.

1842
02:30:51,647 --> 02:30:56,530
I will gavel them and no speculation that will further engage your students will be allowed either.

1843
02:30:57,331 --> 02:30:58,412
So opening it up.

1844
02:31:04,376 --> 02:31:07,218
Seeing Madam Superintendent and Member McLaughlin.

1845
02:31:09,721 --> 02:31:11,622
Madam President and council members.

1846
02:31:13,043 --> 02:31:15,565
I am Maurice Edward Vincent, superintendent of schools.

1847
02:31:15,725 --> 02:31:31,115
I am here this evening to first represent the district and to say that the incident that took place yesterday is not something that we want to see repeated ever again in the Medford Public Schools.

1848
02:31:31,635 --> 02:31:38,580
I don't endorse or support any kind of weapons coming into the school that is not the Medford Public Schools

1849
02:31:38,947 --> 02:31:40,168
that I am here representing.

1850
02:31:40,568 --> 02:31:44,172
So what happened yesterday was a terrible, terrible incident.

1851
02:31:44,932 --> 02:31:48,015
It was not something that we knew was going to happen in advance.

1852
02:31:48,736 --> 02:31:54,240
And working with communications to get that message out and trying to keep the entire community safe.

1853
02:31:54,981 --> 02:31:57,263
Working collaboratively with the police, we had

1854
02:31:57,855 --> 02:32:03,378
many, many police officers on campus yesterday, and there was a lot of investigating happening.

1855
02:32:03,398 --> 02:32:11,202
There was a lot of information that as things were unfolding, we had to wait for more information to become available.

1856
02:32:11,723 --> 02:32:21,188
So I know that we had two medical emergencies yesterday, one earlier in the morning, which was a separate event, and then the second event that took place.

1857
02:32:22,108 --> 02:32:25,630
And that incident and all students that were involved

1858
02:32:26,105 --> 02:32:27,706
a significant number of students.

1859
02:32:28,926 --> 02:32:35,690
Again, looking at the video cameras and figuring out how many people were actually involved, it's a significant number.

1860
02:32:36,330 --> 02:32:38,551
We had plenty of police support today.

1861
02:32:38,971 --> 02:32:41,312
We also had fire support in the schools.

1862
02:32:42,093 --> 02:32:53,118
Our fire personnel, additional administrators were at the high school, teachers, staff, everyone, it was all hands on deck working together to keep the community safe.

1863
02:32:53,732 --> 02:32:56,113
We did have a higher absentee rate.

1864
02:32:56,554 --> 02:33:00,355
It wasn't 400 students, but we were in the high 200s today.

1865
02:33:00,996 --> 02:33:05,418
Normally we hover around 10% in terms of absence.

1866
02:33:07,059 --> 02:33:16,164
I am here today to just say that we are doing everything that we can do to address the situation that happened based on the students that are involved.

1867
02:33:16,764 --> 02:33:20,086
And because of the nature of yesterday's incident,

1868
02:33:20,841 --> 02:33:29,706
The police again are continuing their investigation at MPD and we are working collaboratively because it is an ongoing investigation.

1869
02:33:30,226 --> 02:33:35,369
And again, it was a significant number of students that were involved, others that were just bystanders.

1870
02:33:35,930 --> 02:33:45,475
And so that's the reason why there's been limited information because it's still an active, very active situation.

1871
02:33:46,556 --> 02:33:49,458
I do also want to report that we did have the opportunity

1872
02:33:50,422 --> 02:33:56,086
speak with the family today and with the student on campus.

1873
02:33:56,666 --> 02:34:09,854
And we are continuing to pray for his speedy recovery, but we are in communication and we are working collaboratively with the family as well.

1874
02:34:11,315 --> 02:34:15,018
My understanding that the student was relatively new student in the school transfer student.

1875
02:34:15,038 --> 02:34:16,339
That's my understanding.

1876
02:34:17,469 --> 02:34:21,192
It is a vocational student in one of our programs.

1877
02:34:21,212 --> 02:34:21,452
Yes.

1878
02:34:21,612 --> 02:34:26,815
And do you feel as though this might be related to a bullying incident or something like that, an underlying bullying incident?

1879
02:34:27,056 --> 02:34:35,561
What was the basis of the argument, the series of events or event that gave cause to arise to such an action?

1880
02:34:35,841 --> 02:34:44,767
So again, that action was surprising to everyone based on some of what's been shown on some of the video footage.

1881
02:34:45,728 --> 02:34:46,849
We're not sure.

1882
02:34:48,200 --> 02:34:52,822
There were comments about other interactions happening at other times.

1883
02:34:53,482 --> 02:35:04,025
Since it is an active investigation, I have to be, I'm not able to say too much, but what I can say is it's an active investigation.

1884
02:35:04,425 --> 02:35:15,848
The police are deeply involved and any situation involving weapons, which are not allowed in schools, discipline is being meted out.

1885
02:35:16,295 --> 02:35:20,576
according to what is said in the law regarding any kind of weapon.

1886
02:35:20,996 --> 02:35:26,458
So I do want to say that it's not being taken lightly, it's being addressed appropriately.

1887
02:35:26,838 --> 02:35:42,802
And because of FERPA, I still need to be careful with what is said publicly on the floor, but what I can assure this body and the community that is listening is that it is being addressed and we are making sure that we have all of the individuals

1888
02:35:43,387 --> 02:35:46,388
that were involved or were bystanders.

1889
02:35:48,668 --> 02:35:49,728
Thank you.

1890
02:35:49,868 --> 02:35:53,589
Could the student that stabbed the other student actually be let back into school?

1891
02:35:54,369 --> 02:35:55,469
Not according to the law.

1892
02:35:56,690 --> 02:35:59,230
Is it the intention of the school administration to expel that student?

1893
02:35:59,250 --> 02:36:00,350
We are following the law, yes.

1894
02:36:00,730 --> 02:36:03,511
Any kind of weapon that's- You're going to expel the kid.

1895
02:36:03,571 --> 02:36:04,731
We follow the law.

1896
02:36:04,871 --> 02:36:05,151
Yes.

1897
02:36:05,171 --> 02:36:06,872
I'm asking if the kid's getting expelled.

1898
02:36:08,472 --> 02:36:08,672
May I?

1899
02:36:10,038 --> 02:36:11,138
So thank you.

1900
02:36:11,158 --> 02:36:12,919
I'm Melanie McLaughlin.

1901
02:36:12,959 --> 02:36:13,859
I'm a school committee member.

1902
02:36:13,879 --> 02:36:19,681
I'm also a parent of three, two Medford high school graduates, one current Medford public school student.

1903
02:36:20,281 --> 02:36:33,086
I've lived in Medford for 23 years and I'm here tonight specifically because I want to support the superintendent in her role and because I want to support the school committee and the parents and families and students in the city.

1904
02:36:33,906 --> 02:36:37,447
We're all heartbroken about what has happened to our children.

1905
02:36:37,913 --> 02:36:41,334
or the past few months, but it has not been just the past few months.

1906
02:36:41,414 --> 02:36:45,856
And there are plenty of people in the community that know that and that understand that it has been years.

1907
02:36:46,356 --> 02:36:47,496
We've had a bullying problem.

1908
02:36:47,556 --> 02:36:49,177
Most high schools have bullying problems.

1909
02:36:49,197 --> 02:36:50,857
There's a rise in violence.

1910
02:36:51,277 --> 02:36:51,978
It's national.

1911
02:36:52,038 --> 02:36:53,298
You can see it all over the country.

1912
02:36:53,818 --> 02:36:58,740
It is happening, particularly because of pandemic, but also because of the politicized nature

1913
02:36:59,162 --> 02:37:03,464
of the hatred that exists in communities between polarized sides.

1914
02:37:03,865 --> 02:37:07,006
And our children are often mimicking what they're seeing their adults do.

1915
02:37:07,447 --> 02:37:18,753
And what I think is really important is what we've heard from city council members who are talking about finding solutions to work together, to collaborate, to change systems for all of our children, not some of our children, all of our children.

1916
02:37:19,053 --> 02:37:19,853
This has been ongoing.

1917
02:37:19,873 --> 02:37:24,976
We're talking about not just the past four years of this administration, meaning this particular superintendent.

1918
02:37:25,316 --> 02:37:28,198
This has been an ongoing problem from when other people were on school committee.

1919
02:37:28,580 --> 02:37:30,361
from when people have been around for some time.

1920
02:37:30,381 --> 02:37:33,422
I want to clarify for the community and for city counselors.

1921
02:37:34,902 --> 02:37:36,663
I'm not afraid of being yelled at.

1922
02:37:37,203 --> 02:37:38,083
I just don't like it.

1923
02:37:38,443 --> 02:37:40,584
I think it's inappropriate and unprofessional.

1924
02:37:41,244 --> 02:37:50,207
And when we talk about bullying in our community, I have never seen more of an example of bullying in our community that I see in the city council chambers every single week.

1925
02:37:51,951 --> 02:37:54,433
And I think that everybody in the community would agree with that.

1926
02:37:54,513 --> 02:37:55,314
Point of information.

1927
02:37:55,494 --> 02:37:57,936
There's a difference between bullying and passion.

1928
02:37:58,277 --> 02:37:59,918
And that's what you lack, ma'am.

1929
02:37:59,938 --> 02:38:01,920
You lack the passion.

1930
02:38:03,121 --> 02:38:04,922
I think we both know each other well, George.

1931
02:38:04,942 --> 02:38:05,803
We're all neighbors here.

1932
02:38:05,843 --> 02:38:06,624
We all know each other.

1933
02:38:07,184 --> 02:38:08,045
We all know each other.

1934
02:38:08,446 --> 02:38:10,027
Our children play together.

1935
02:38:10,087 --> 02:38:13,150
If you could please continue through the chair.

1936
02:38:13,210 --> 02:38:14,331
Great choice of support.

1937
02:38:19,887 --> 02:38:23,308
So the ongoing bullying is inappropriate and is what our children are seeing.

1938
02:38:23,668 --> 02:38:25,589
And that's what I would like to specifically point out.

1939
02:38:25,969 --> 02:38:31,450
We wanna figure out how to work, should collaborate together to change outcomes for all children.

1940
02:38:31,830 --> 02:38:36,571
And I'm not gonna be shamed, I'm not gonna be blamed and I'm not gonna be named and neither should any of us.

1941
02:38:37,011 --> 02:38:43,393
And I would ask that our city council members across the board and that our community across the board stand up to bullies everywhere.

1942
02:38:44,033 --> 02:38:47,134
And we make sure that this stops in our community and in our schools.

1943
02:38:48,138 --> 02:38:51,240
And I'm here to do that, and I'm here to roll up my sleeves and help make sure that that happens.

1944
02:38:51,560 --> 02:38:53,141
And I think we all should be doing that.

1945
02:38:54,181 --> 02:38:54,482
Thank you.

1946
02:38:55,642 --> 02:38:58,444
Point of information, Madam President.

1947
02:38:58,744 --> 02:39:05,848
Madam Superintendent, yesterday a young man came to the podium and addressed the situation that happened.

1948
02:39:06,628 --> 02:39:11,511
Did you hear the young man who described a very similar situation just a few weeks prior?

1949
02:39:12,872 --> 02:39:13,993
I asked the superintendent.

1950
02:39:14,293 --> 02:39:14,453
Yes.

1951
02:39:17,078 --> 02:39:18,058
Was that addressed today?

1952
02:39:18,459 --> 02:39:28,062
Did you contact the guidance counselor that he talked to, to express the concern of the same people threatening him to stab him?

1953
02:39:28,543 --> 02:39:30,123
Did you address that today?

1954
02:39:31,484 --> 02:39:37,706
That specific comment that was made yesterday, it's still being under investigation.

1955
02:39:37,806 --> 02:39:45,089
And there's another, there are other things that have come forward, which are also being fully investigated.

1956
02:39:48,257 --> 02:39:48,697
Thank you.

1957
02:39:49,958 --> 02:39:51,799
Thank you.

1958
02:39:52,860 --> 02:39:55,782
Thank you, Madam Superintendent.

1959
02:39:56,642 --> 02:39:57,222
Councilor Carvalho.

1960
02:39:57,883 --> 02:40:00,044
Madam Superintendent, I have a question.

1961
02:40:01,845 --> 02:40:06,848
What I'm a little concerned about what I'm seeing now is these are looking like staged events.

1962
02:40:07,529 --> 02:40:10,851
These are kids standing there waiting for this to happen.

1963
02:40:11,571 --> 02:40:13,752
And that upsets me most.

1964
02:40:14,273 --> 02:40:17,575
I mean, I saw the video, this one, another one says,

1965
02:40:18,925 --> 02:40:24,690
and kids are standing there with the cameras, like this is a TV show production waiting to happen.

1966
02:40:24,950 --> 02:40:25,850
Everyone's got a camera.

1967
02:40:26,371 --> 02:40:29,033
Why aren't those kids being suspended too?

1968
02:40:29,273 --> 02:40:35,678
Councilor Carvalho, I agree exactly with what you're saying right now.

1969
02:40:35,698 --> 02:40:45,466
The professional videographers, events that are taking place where it appears to be staged, we are having very similar conversations with the police.

1970
02:40:46,345 --> 02:40:57,068
All of the individuals that were involved in yesterday's event, based on what we could see from the video footage, they are all being addressed, including the bystanders.

1971
02:40:59,208 --> 02:41:05,710
So all of the individuals that we've been able to identify, discipline is being meted out.

1972
02:41:07,330 --> 02:41:10,231
Discipline is being meted out at the district level.

1973
02:41:10,891 --> 02:41:13,072
So again, students videotaping it,

1974
02:41:13,556 --> 02:41:15,798
students that are just watching their bystanders.

1975
02:41:15,818 --> 02:41:21,381
Let them go to the TV station and put their skills at our TV station at the high school.

1976
02:41:22,062 --> 02:41:24,203
It is, I mean, the challenges that we're facing.

1977
02:41:24,223 --> 02:41:25,805
Not saying they're waiting for fights to happen.

1978
02:41:27,045 --> 02:41:28,466
That really upsets me when I see that.

1979
02:41:28,586 --> 02:41:35,171
I'm not saying that's your fault, but that upsets me when there's a whole bunch of kids waiting, because they all knew that this was going to happen.

1980
02:41:37,032 --> 02:41:38,854
The social media piece of it is very upsetting.

1981
02:41:43,182 --> 02:41:45,263
another challenge that didn't exist 12 years ago.

1982
02:41:48,605 --> 02:41:50,286
Social media is a challenge.

1983
02:41:50,806 --> 02:41:52,427
Social media is truly a challenge.

1984
02:41:52,527 --> 02:42:02,673
It's a huge challenge, especially for bullying, especially for videos being distributed, for videos being given to the news media, for information being shared, for people politicizing situation is terrible.

1985
02:42:03,173 --> 02:42:06,154
And the children are the social media piece of it.

1986
02:42:06,415 --> 02:42:10,997
The bullying element on social media is compounded exponentially.

1987
02:42:11,380 --> 02:42:16,123
So when we talk about resources that we need, we need resources to help support our children's mental health.

1988
02:42:16,203 --> 02:42:20,166
It is a mental health crisis right now because of what people are dealing with on a daily.

1989
02:42:23,248 --> 02:42:27,531
Was there a drug overdose?

1990
02:42:27,812 --> 02:42:37,198
I don't, I just know that there was a medical emergency earlier in the day.

1991
02:42:37,258 --> 02:42:39,420
I was not told that there was a drug overdose.

1992
02:42:41,856 --> 02:42:44,158
You did say that the police and the fire department were there today?

1993
02:42:44,678 --> 02:42:46,399
Yes, providing additional support.

1994
02:42:46,600 --> 02:42:47,580
What kind of support?

1995
02:42:48,481 --> 02:42:50,002
They were supporting in the hallways.

1996
02:42:50,062 --> 02:43:00,089
They were just available and also conducting the investigation as additional students' names became available that did not appear on some of the videos.

1997
02:43:00,769 --> 02:43:05,893
So they've been providing additional support in conducting their official investigation.

1998
02:43:06,093 --> 02:43:07,474
So they weren't there in a security capacity?

1999
02:43:10,595 --> 02:43:11,416
I would say both.

2000
02:43:12,076 --> 02:43:12,877
They were present.

2001
02:43:12,957 --> 02:43:17,400
They were present in hallways, but they were also conducting the investigation.

2002
02:43:21,604 --> 02:43:23,785
We probably had maybe six.

2003
02:43:23,886 --> 02:43:26,948
Maybe there were six police officers there providing support.

2004
02:43:27,809 --> 02:43:29,570
I'm not sure of the final number today.

2005
02:43:30,511 --> 02:43:35,014
And I mean, I understand that, you know, violence happens in schools.

2006
02:43:36,736 --> 02:43:38,097
Most high schools aren't on the news every day.

2007
02:43:39,359 --> 02:43:44,242
as this as is on the news every day surrounding communities on the news every day.

2008
02:43:44,762 --> 02:43:48,163
All right, and don't make this about the Memphis City Council gets passionate about issues.

2009
02:43:48,204 --> 02:43:50,765
So it's our fault that kids get stabbed in high school because that's nonsense.

2010
02:43:50,845 --> 02:43:52,486
All right, because we don't make the policies up there.

2011
02:43:52,746 --> 02:43:55,307
All right, the school committee does they're the ones that set the policies.

2012
02:43:55,667 --> 02:44:00,109
They're the ones that are responsible, but nobody is making policies for students to get injured.

2013
02:44:01,310 --> 02:44:04,412
So there were bigger issues that I want to go to the bathroom.

2014
02:44:04,432 --> 02:44:05,832
Why is it 12 kids hanging on the bathroom?

2015
02:44:05,852 --> 02:44:07,453
Can I can I may I please?

2016
02:44:08,814 --> 02:44:08,974
Sure.

2017
02:44:10,116 --> 02:44:11,497
So this is what we're talking about.

2018
02:44:11,517 --> 02:44:12,578
This is the barraging.

2019
02:44:12,658 --> 02:44:16,101
This is the sort of, you know, back and forth with people trying to intimidate people.

2020
02:44:16,121 --> 02:44:17,122
I think it's really important.

2021
02:44:17,202 --> 02:44:19,524
I'm not trying to hold you accountable for the words you just said.

2022
02:44:19,644 --> 02:44:20,425
I have the floor.

2023
02:44:20,785 --> 02:44:22,887
You don't have a point of information because you're not a counselor.

2024
02:44:23,047 --> 02:44:25,189
Let me know when you're finished.

2025
02:44:25,609 --> 02:44:28,151
I'm finished, Madam President, because this is like ridiculous.

2026
02:44:28,932 --> 02:44:29,593
This is ridiculous.

2027
02:44:29,613 --> 02:44:35,037
So what's the plan going forward tomorrow when these kids go back to school, how are they going to be safer than they were yesterday?

2028
02:44:37,539 --> 02:44:38,340
Let's answer that question.

2029
02:44:38,791 --> 02:44:40,111
because that's really what the people care about.

2030
02:44:40,131 --> 02:44:43,492
May I?

2031
02:44:43,812 --> 02:44:49,974
Yes, for one moment, if you don't mind to pretend, is that okay?

2032
02:44:50,054 --> 02:44:51,314
I'm not answering your question.

2033
02:44:51,374 --> 02:44:51,634
May I?

2034
02:44:52,415 --> 02:44:52,855
To the chair?

2035
02:44:53,995 --> 02:44:54,155
Yes.

2036
02:44:54,315 --> 02:44:54,715
Thank you.

2037
02:44:55,195 --> 02:45:05,238
So I just wanted to say that to Councilor Tsang and Councilor Collins remarks earlier about people who are intimidated to come up to this podium.

2038
02:45:05,888 --> 02:45:15,414
and who are not able to speak for a number of reasons publicly to please feel free to reach out for solution oriented options because we are willing and open to listen to community members.

2039
02:45:15,434 --> 02:45:16,555
This is a community problem.

2040
02:45:16,895 --> 02:45:18,816
This is not seven people that are going to solve a problem.

2041
02:45:18,856 --> 02:45:20,417
It's not one person that's going to solve a problem.

2042
02:45:20,778 --> 02:45:25,981
This is a community systemic problem and it's a national problem and we need all hands working together.

2043
02:45:26,281 --> 02:45:27,702
We don't need people yelling at people.

2044
02:45:27,742 --> 02:45:28,883
We need people collaborating.

2045
02:45:29,479 --> 02:45:30,379
And I don't know.

2046
02:45:30,399 --> 02:45:33,960
And to all those people listening, when you go to the school committee, remember that.

2047
02:45:34,421 --> 02:45:40,663
I just wanted to respond to your comment, Councilor Knight, regarding what is the high school doing?

2048
02:45:40,883 --> 02:45:43,864
We have additional social emotional supports at the school.

2049
02:45:44,404 --> 02:45:47,385
We had outside support available as well at the school.

2050
02:45:47,825 --> 02:45:56,067
We had additional police presence and we redeployed several of our administrators who were also present at the high school today.

2051
02:45:56,088 --> 02:45:57,128
So there were,

2052
02:45:58,346 --> 02:46:06,752
There was an abundance of administrators, staff, police presence, fire presence, additional counselors.

2053
02:46:06,932 --> 02:46:13,497
We were all hands on deck working collaboratively to keep everything running smoothly at the high school today.

2054
02:46:13,617 --> 02:46:16,179
And we had a very quiet day today.

2055
02:46:18,497 --> 02:46:19,377
but I just have a question.

2056
02:46:19,417 --> 02:46:25,579
How many of those administrators and other individuals that were deployed in the hallways that trained in safety training, trained in how to keep somebody safe?

2057
02:46:25,719 --> 02:46:27,619
How many?

2058
02:46:29,199 --> 02:46:33,940
I don't know, you keep piping in too, so I'm trying to figure that out.

2059
02:46:34,020 --> 02:46:38,541
Everybody's interrupting each other, so maybe you should stop that.

2060
02:46:38,601 --> 02:46:45,903
So all the administrators that are there are providing additional support and supervision in the hallways

2061
02:46:46,848 --> 02:46:50,289
during passing, during transition times for the students.

2062
02:46:50,969 --> 02:46:56,170
So that was part of what took place today because students did express that they did not feel safe.

2063
02:46:56,590 --> 02:47:01,431
There was a lot of extra presence and extra support today and extra counseling support.

2064
02:47:01,851 --> 02:47:05,151
All of that is going to be available for the entire week.

2065
02:47:05,671 --> 02:47:12,692
We are there to meet the needs of our students, the staff and teachers, many of them were also on duty.

2066
02:47:12,852 --> 02:47:15,653
They volunteered and they were providing additional

2067
02:47:16,281 --> 02:47:23,066
support and supervision in the hallways today and things were, it was a quiet day today.

2068
02:47:23,526 --> 02:47:26,809
So we were very happy that it was a productive day for the community.

2069
02:47:27,870 --> 02:47:37,817
We know that it's going to take time and that's why we do also have the additional counseling support available for any student and staff that require that.

2070
02:47:39,238 --> 02:47:45,423
I'm a little bit less concerned about the counseling of the traumatized bodies and I'm a little bit more concerned about how we're going to keep bodies safe

2071
02:47:50,624 --> 02:47:51,444
on that, right?

2072
02:47:51,684 --> 02:47:53,766
These events are happening over and over again.

2073
02:47:53,926 --> 02:47:55,747
They are not happening over and over again.

2074
02:47:55,787 --> 02:47:58,329
Two major events in the last 60 days.

2075
02:47:58,409 --> 02:48:00,071
But that is not over and over again.

2076
02:48:00,391 --> 02:48:01,472
It's not isolated.

2077
02:48:01,512 --> 02:48:03,513
Councilor Scarpelli has a point of information.

2078
02:48:04,134 --> 02:48:17,884
Would it be shocking, Madam Superintendent, that a few phone calls I did receive from personnel that were there to support that there were still numerous students walking the halls freely?

2079
02:48:20,350 --> 02:48:22,072
Has that even been addressed?

2080
02:48:22,492 --> 02:48:24,854
I have been, I was in the hallways today as well.

2081
02:48:24,894 --> 02:48:27,516
So I don't know exactly what point in time that was.

2082
02:48:27,736 --> 02:48:34,002
Students were allowed to go between, some students maybe needed a break.

2083
02:48:34,082 --> 02:48:40,227
I'm not sure the information that you're receiving because that's not the information that I saw firsthand today.

2084
02:48:40,327 --> 02:48:47,393
And I was with the administration, Principal DeLava, Principal Fallon, the assistant principals, we were together today.

2085
02:48:48,107 --> 02:48:55,800
And there was significant, significant adult presence in all of the hallways, including additional teachers and staff.

2086
02:48:56,281 --> 02:49:00,468
So that's not the experience that I saw today at the high school.

2087
02:49:00,488 --> 02:49:01,330
Okay, that's good to hear.

2088
02:49:02,059 --> 02:49:19,194
As you approach the re-entry and starting the new year off, I would really hope, from what I've heard from the kids, is that your administration, yourself personally, bring the student body together so they can understand what's going on because they're lost.

2089
02:49:19,935 --> 02:49:24,179
Over the last incident that happened, they were waiting for some sort of

2090
02:49:24,872 --> 02:49:31,697
acknowledgement of something and to keep them feeling safe, that was not done.

2091
02:49:32,918 --> 02:49:46,768
I hope moving forward on the third, that the student body is in one area that they can see the leadership of our school system to show them that we're there and we understand what we're trying to say.

2092
02:49:46,788 --> 02:49:47,969
That hasn't been done yet.

2093
02:49:48,049 --> 02:49:52,152
Okay, so what you're talking about, we are working on meeting with the students.

2094
02:49:52,232 --> 02:49:53,713
We would not meet with all 1300 students

2095
02:49:55,312 --> 02:49:57,793
at one time because it's just too large a number.

2096
02:49:58,293 --> 02:50:11,275
So we have already been planning to meet with the students by grade level teams and in smaller groups of hundreds so that it's a more manageable number and that students will have an opportunity to speak back.

2097
02:50:11,415 --> 02:50:14,836
So we are actively working on that as a team.

2098
02:50:14,976 --> 02:50:15,356
Thank you.

2099
02:50:24,117 --> 02:50:24,857
Name for the record, please.

2100
02:50:25,457 --> 02:50:26,157
Nicole Branley.

2101
02:50:28,218 --> 02:50:30,478
Every time I come to these meetings, I say, I'm not gonna speak.

2102
02:50:30,678 --> 02:50:32,659
And then I listen to what everybody has to say.

2103
02:50:33,619 --> 02:50:42,101
And I take a lot of notes and everybody here makes it pretty easy for me to end up being the, maybe the calm voice.

2104
02:50:42,941 --> 02:50:44,241
Maybe that everybody needs to hear.

2105
02:50:44,261 --> 02:50:47,042
Maybe it's the parents and the kids at home that need to hear my voice.

2106
02:50:47,362 --> 02:50:47,962
Maybe it's you.

2107
02:50:49,982 --> 02:50:52,343
I hope I'm not just hearing myself at this point.

2108
02:50:53,146 --> 02:50:54,467
but a lot of things have been said.

2109
02:50:54,487 --> 02:51:02,293
I heard the superintendent say that all hands were on deck.

2110
02:51:03,494 --> 02:51:04,315
We need that every day.

2111
02:51:05,376 --> 02:51:07,878
We need all hands on deck every single day for these children.

2112
02:51:14,603 --> 02:51:22,269
Councilor Scarpelli quoted our daughter and our community really has seemed to rally around step up

2113
02:51:23,432 --> 02:51:24,193
or step down.

2114
02:51:26,074 --> 02:51:32,038
But there was something else that our daughter said yesterday that impressed me.

2115
02:51:32,879 --> 02:51:48,630
And this morning I sent an email to her teachers and she said, if it weren't for my amazing teachers and my amazing vocational program, I would transfer, I would leave.

2116
02:51:50,872 --> 02:51:52,273
I think that says a lot.

2117
02:51:52,859 --> 02:52:04,864
about our staff, about our teachers, about her friends who are dealing with this at her age, right along with her, with their families who have stood by our side.

2118
02:52:06,785 --> 02:52:15,289
It's very impressive to me that the teachers were the ones that were with our kids today.

2119
02:52:15,989 --> 02:52:19,831
They were the ones that were with our children during that lockdown yesterday.

2120
02:52:20,652 --> 02:52:24,594
As upset as my daughter was, her teacher took care of her yesterday.

2121
02:52:26,375 --> 02:52:28,797
Her teacher saved her life on October 17th.

2122
02:52:31,579 --> 02:52:34,360
Her teachers saved her life.

2123
02:52:36,141 --> 02:52:43,806
I know four by name, there were others in the incident report that I did not know of, but they saved her life.

2124
02:52:46,888 --> 02:52:48,529
We're asking a lot of our teachers

2125
02:52:50,076 --> 02:52:55,058
or asking too much, but yet they're rising to the occasion every single time.

2126
02:52:55,178 --> 02:52:56,198
And so are these kids.

2127
02:52:57,339 --> 02:52:58,899
These kids are kids.

2128
02:52:59,580 --> 02:53:01,400
We have to be the adults that lead here.

2129
02:53:01,920 --> 02:53:03,461
We have to be the adults that lead here.

2130
02:53:04,241 --> 02:53:12,124
So when it comes down to money, there's no dollar amount that should be set on any child.

2131
02:53:13,345 --> 02:53:15,906
And I know that in the big picture, we have limits.

2132
02:53:16,146 --> 02:53:16,706
I get that.

2133
02:53:17,478 --> 02:53:22,440
but our teachers, our staff, our students, families, this is what's the most important thing.

2134
02:53:22,460 --> 02:53:28,323
I heard many people say that there's been years of bullying.

2135
02:53:30,164 --> 02:53:31,065
Years of bullying.

2136
02:53:32,966 --> 02:53:38,188
The bullying in our situation started in June, continued in September.

2137
02:53:39,809 --> 02:53:45,812
I have one, two, three, four police reports since September.

2138
02:53:46,064 --> 02:53:47,585
for our situation of bullying.

2139
02:53:49,266 --> 02:54:03,635
And yet the bullying plan that we have was not initiated until the nurse saw my daughter on October 17th.

2140
02:54:03,675 --> 02:54:05,116
I want you to hear that.

2141
02:54:05,977 --> 02:54:10,940
No one filled out that bullying incident report until October 17th when she was on the ground.

2142
02:54:12,061 --> 02:54:15,943
And the nurse asked me, is this something that's been going on?

2143
02:54:16,553 --> 02:54:19,194
I said, yes, we've been dealing with this since June.

2144
02:54:20,075 --> 02:54:23,076
And she said, I need to write the bullying incident report.

2145
02:54:23,917 --> 02:54:26,338
I didn't receive it until December 9th.

2146
02:54:28,619 --> 02:54:29,280
I asked for it.

2147
02:54:29,500 --> 02:54:30,440
You all know I asked for it.

2148
02:54:30,460 --> 02:54:32,901
I asked all of you to help me get that paperwork.

2149
02:54:38,484 --> 02:54:39,985
So years of bullying have been happening.

2150
02:54:40,365 --> 02:54:43,827
And that bullying plan that I sat on a subcommittee meeting

2151
02:54:45,397 --> 02:54:45,597
Right?

2152
02:54:45,797 --> 02:54:49,638
Subcommittee meeting, school committee meeting on December 6th.

2153
02:54:49,858 --> 02:54:52,198
And I said, I've never gotten these papers.

2154
02:54:52,618 --> 02:55:05,660
I don't, I asked if the bullying plan that we were going over was actually something currently that we were using because it was foreign to me in the sense that none of it was executed.

2155
02:55:06,981 --> 02:55:10,301
So what we have in place needs to be followed.

2156
02:55:10,581 --> 02:55:12,362
We have a whole bunch of stuff that we need to do.

2157
02:55:12,402 --> 02:55:13,142
Don't get me wrong.

2158
02:55:13,282 --> 02:55:14,882
We have a whole bunch of stuff that we need to do.

2159
02:55:15,403 --> 02:55:16,563
We really need to step it up.

2160
02:55:17,904 --> 02:55:21,404
But what we have in place could work if we followed it also.

2161
02:55:21,884 --> 02:55:22,804
That has to be done.

2162
02:55:23,545 --> 02:55:30,926
So I know Councilor Nye, you said maybe cancel school for the rest of the week because no learning will be done.

2163
02:55:32,746 --> 02:55:45,089
But maybe something just as valuable as learning can be done because I noticed today that for our daughter, it was a bit therapeutic.

2164
02:55:45,883 --> 02:55:49,424
to be with her friends, to be with other students.

2165
02:55:50,144 --> 02:55:56,847
I understand why parents or guardians felt that they didn't feel comfortable sending their kids or that kids didn't feel comfortable being at school today.

2166
02:55:57,147 --> 02:55:57,827
I understand that.

2167
02:55:58,387 --> 02:56:01,508
But today was probably the safest day to be at school.

2168
02:56:03,729 --> 02:56:04,789
It certainly wasn't yesterday.

2169
02:56:05,910 --> 02:56:07,630
And it certainly wasn't October 17th.

2170
02:56:09,271 --> 02:56:10,071
I can vouch for that.

2171
02:56:11,532 --> 02:56:13,632
So we have all these good faith discussions.

2172
02:56:13,732 --> 02:56:14,453
I heard the words.

2173
02:56:16,396 --> 02:56:18,837
mentioned sustainable solutions.

2174
02:56:21,138 --> 02:56:22,679
We need to put our politics aside.

2175
02:56:23,479 --> 02:56:25,280
We really need to put our politics aside.

2176
02:56:25,480 --> 02:56:27,000
We need to all stop arguing.

2177
02:56:27,020 --> 02:56:30,422
I know that I was very emotional last night.

2178
02:56:30,442 --> 02:56:33,743
This whole situation is making me lose my voice.

2179
02:56:35,424 --> 02:56:39,125
But the division is what our kids are seeing.

2180
02:56:41,966 --> 02:56:42,767
That's not okay.

2181
02:56:43,287 --> 02:56:43,927
It's not okay.

2182
02:56:44,267 --> 02:56:45,548
They need to see us all united.

2183
02:56:46,059 --> 02:56:51,241
And I think that I've been very vocal to everybody that I am willing to help.

2184
02:56:52,162 --> 02:56:54,003
I have an army of people behind me.

2185
02:56:54,583 --> 02:56:55,163
I really do.

2186
02:56:55,183 --> 02:56:57,804
It is amazing to me, the outpouring of people.

2187
02:56:57,924 --> 02:57:05,028
And I thank every single last one of them because it has helped give me the strength and helped give my daughter the strength.

2188
02:57:05,048 --> 02:57:12,491
Our family, my husband and my son give us the strength to keep moving forward because there's no doubt if I went away,

2189
02:57:13,981 --> 02:57:23,303
If I went away October 17th, if I pulled her from Mefford High, we'd be here right now, but it wouldn't be about her.

2190
02:57:24,623 --> 02:57:28,144
It would just be another situation and maybe the urgency wouldn't be there.

2191
02:57:28,804 --> 02:57:30,885
I don't know why this has all happened to us.

2192
02:57:32,405 --> 02:57:36,426
I really don't, but we can't stop.

2193
02:57:36,686 --> 02:57:41,627
And I just, I beg every single parent to come to every single school committee meeting

2194
02:57:42,452 --> 02:57:43,072
to join me.

2195
02:57:43,472 --> 02:57:49,735
I've sat here the first night, an abundance of people, but I've sat here every single meeting.

2196
02:57:49,855 --> 02:57:50,716
You all have seen me.

2197
02:57:51,036 --> 02:57:52,016
I've spoken at your meetings.

2198
02:57:52,056 --> 02:57:55,338
I think this is number three here at the city council.

2199
02:57:56,398 --> 02:57:57,759
We need to hear your voice.

2200
02:57:58,599 --> 02:58:01,421
We need to hear voices, parents, because I've heard you all.

2201
02:58:01,681 --> 02:58:05,162
I'm relaying the messages, but I'm just one woman repeating myself.

2202
02:58:05,503 --> 02:58:07,423
We need all of your voices.

2203
02:58:08,044 --> 02:58:10,125
So I also wanted to mention too,

2204
02:58:11,500 --> 02:58:13,701
My full police reports are all about bullying.

2205
02:58:14,421 --> 02:58:19,703
But I met this other mom yesterday outside of Medford High, someone I've never met before in my life.

2206
02:58:20,724 --> 02:58:21,344
I don't know her.

2207
02:58:22,024 --> 02:58:25,065
Between us, we have seven police reports from this school year.

2208
02:58:29,927 --> 02:58:31,468
Her story is so similar to mine.

2209
02:58:32,768 --> 02:58:38,570
I feel like I've known her for a very long time, even though we've just met yesterday outside of Medford High School.

2210
02:58:39,311 --> 02:58:40,031
This is not

2211
02:58:42,095 --> 02:58:46,076
a bond moms should have while their daughters are in high school.

2212
02:58:47,697 --> 02:58:49,818
This is not the bond that we should be making.

2213
02:58:50,858 --> 02:58:51,918
And I'm grateful for it.

2214
02:58:53,339 --> 02:58:55,460
But this is a sad time.

2215
02:58:55,720 --> 02:58:56,840
It really is a sad time.

2216
02:58:57,180 --> 02:58:58,101
We need to step up.

2217
02:58:59,181 --> 02:59:00,742
We need to work together, please.

2218
02:59:01,822 --> 02:59:07,364
I've asked, and I almost messaged the school committee today and said, let me help.

2219
02:59:08,288 --> 02:59:08,828
let me help.

2220
02:59:09,049 --> 02:59:10,570
I'll come to I've been at every meeting.

2221
02:59:11,110 --> 02:59:11,791
I've been here.

2222
02:59:11,911 --> 02:59:12,571
I'll do it all.

2223
02:59:12,591 --> 02:59:13,672
I'll do it all.

2224
02:59:13,792 --> 02:59:14,333
Just tell me.

2225
02:59:14,653 --> 02:59:16,795
I think you all know how persistent I am at this point.

2226
02:59:17,555 --> 02:59:18,516
I'm not going away.

2227
02:59:18,536 --> 02:59:19,897
I love this city.

2228
02:59:19,917 --> 02:59:22,759
I love I believe the blue and white too.

2229
02:59:23,580 --> 02:59:24,220
I believe it too.

2230
02:59:24,741 --> 02:59:29,484
And I and I want to be proud and I always have been I'm so proud that the football team was here tonight.

2231
02:59:29,905 --> 02:59:36,830
I we need to we need to recognize all the good that's happening here starting with the teachers, the sports

2232
02:59:37,405 --> 02:59:40,846
the culinary program, the vocational school, all of it.

2233
02:59:40,926 --> 02:59:45,347
It needs to be celebrated, but we can't let this other stuff go be swept under the rug anymore.

2234
02:59:46,847 --> 02:59:48,388
So thank you again for your time.

2235
02:59:48,408 --> 02:59:51,148
Okay.

2236
02:59:53,069 --> 02:59:53,889
She's a little nervous.

2237
02:59:53,929 --> 02:59:55,269
She asked me if I would stand with her.

2238
02:59:55,510 --> 02:59:55,750
Thank you.

2239
02:59:55,770 --> 02:59:59,711
And I just wanna, just cause there's, we'll take the two people standing in person and then I'll go to Zoom.

2240
02:59:59,791 --> 03:00:00,491
So thank you.

2241
03:00:01,151 --> 03:00:02,211
Name and address for the record, please.

2242
03:00:02,871 --> 03:00:05,152
My name is Samantha Ripley and I live on Kenmare Road.

2243
03:00:06,477 --> 03:00:12,520
We all know what has been going on at the high school for a few months now, and it's gotten to the point where we had a stabbing yesterday morning.

2244
03:00:13,380 --> 03:00:16,881
Many of the students I know are afraid to go to school because this has gotten too far.

2245
03:00:17,381 --> 03:00:21,663
I personally haven't had to experience many problems at this school, but my friends have.

2246
03:00:22,163 --> 03:00:26,265
I wanted to speak out tonight in hopes my voice will be heard on the issues going on at the school.

2247
03:00:26,645 --> 03:00:31,467
As a student who actively has to get up each morning into that building, I wonder what

2248
03:00:31,903 --> 03:00:34,644
and walk into that building and wonder what can possibly happen next.

2249
03:00:35,164 --> 03:00:39,906
As a senior about to finish and graduate from this high school, I'm ashamed to be graduating from Medford.

2250
03:00:40,327 --> 03:00:51,991
I did not attend the school my freshman year as I went to Malton Catholic, but this past year has left me questioning why I left with all the violence that is going on and the fact that a plan hasn't been placed into action to stop the violence.

2251
03:00:52,532 --> 03:00:58,174
When I first came to Medford High, I was extremely excited because I had the opportunity to be a part of the vocational program.

2252
03:00:58,708 --> 03:01:02,830
But lately, I haven't been feeling safe at a place many of us call our second home.

2253
03:01:03,371 --> 03:01:08,114
We are tired and frustrating of having to enter the halls of Medford High, wondering what will occur today.

2254
03:01:08,654 --> 03:01:12,236
Why aren't the voices of students and teachers who are being affected being heard?

2255
03:01:12,796 --> 03:01:17,779
We are in that building for six hours plus a day, five days a week, and our voices aren't being heard.

2256
03:01:18,280 --> 03:01:21,942
Well, we are the ones who have to witness incidents occur on a daily basis.

2257
03:01:22,522 --> 03:01:24,103
What more has to be done for something

2258
03:01:24,480 --> 03:01:26,321
What more has to happen for something to be done?

2259
03:01:26,801 --> 03:01:30,083
It has gotten to a point where students and parents are now concerned about safety.

2260
03:01:31,024 --> 03:01:42,011
All we want to know is what we will, what steps will, sorry, all we want to know is what will be the next steps to help the school become a safer environment that an incident like this will not happen again.

2261
03:01:42,691 --> 03:01:44,232
The school should have been placed

2262
03:01:44,575 --> 03:01:49,397
I should have placed a disciplinary action as soon as we got back into the building during the hybrid schedule.

2263
03:01:49,877 --> 03:01:57,201
All the student wants is to be able to feel safe and know they have the right guidance from the faculty who are supposed to be leading us into this adult life.

2264
03:01:57,721 --> 03:02:06,085
The fact that after three plus hours on lockdown, we had a fire alarm go off and many students were anxious and scared and just wanting to leave.

2265
03:02:06,385 --> 03:02:13,668
My anxiety was so high yesterday that once the fire alarm went off, my history teacher from last year had to help me calm down because I was crying.

2266
03:02:14,399 --> 03:02:22,084
All because of the staff we have to guide us, do not know how to handle such situations because of the lack of resources given.

2267
03:02:22,644 --> 03:02:27,727
I shouldn't have to be worrying about my safety for myself and my friends while at a place that is supposed to protect us.

2268
03:02:28,348 --> 03:02:35,232
I should be excited for the next few months as graduation is coming up, but instead I'm expressing my concerns on the safety for everyone at MHS.

2269
03:02:35,872 --> 03:02:38,674
There needs to be more interaction between staff and students.

2270
03:02:39,074 --> 03:02:41,776
The lack of trust and support that students have from faculty

2271
03:02:42,192 --> 03:02:44,373
to express concern is unacceptable.

2272
03:02:44,994 --> 03:02:50,397
The students should have something to look forward to and not having to worry about if we will be the next victim.

2273
03:02:50,898 --> 03:02:53,960
This is a huge problem that we as the students not fail.

2274
03:02:54,120 --> 03:03:02,606
We have the support from many faculty and staff members in the building, the building we spend most of our time out of our day in.

2275
03:03:04,287 --> 03:03:09,170
We all just want actions with solutions to be placed into a system to help our anxiety and to be able

2276
03:03:09,658 --> 03:03:12,999
to feel safe at school so we can get the proper education we deserve.

2277
03:03:13,279 --> 03:03:13,659
Thank you.

2278
03:03:14,459 --> 03:03:18,019
John, thank you.

2279
03:03:18,099 --> 03:03:26,161
Okay, well, I'll stay with everybody's the popular one.

2280
03:03:26,621 --> 03:03:28,941
So good evening, my name is Joanne.

2281
03:03:29,821 --> 03:03:32,942
My daughter is a sophomore at the high school.

2282
03:03:33,042 --> 03:03:35,062
She's also in the vocational program.

2283
03:03:35,682 --> 03:03:39,083
My daughter has goals and dreams like most of

2284
03:03:40,236 --> 03:03:43,497
your children, if you have children, she wants to be a trauma surgeon.

2285
03:03:43,998 --> 03:03:45,298
She wants to reach that goal.

2286
03:03:45,478 --> 03:03:46,639
I expect her to do that.

2287
03:03:50,260 --> 03:03:59,524
I never thought I'd be here discussing this, but bullying, it's a real thing in the school, outside of school as well.

2288
03:04:00,764 --> 03:04:03,545
I have an only child, and

2289
03:04:07,202 --> 03:04:17,171
The police reports that I obtained, because you need three, I have probably 10 just from this school year, okay?

2290
03:04:17,652 --> 03:04:24,558
So this one was from April, but this was a continuation from last year, but this was April of this year.

2291
03:04:25,098 --> 03:04:26,820
It's quite a few pages long.

2292
03:04:26,840 --> 03:04:33,726
This incident, my daughter was in her classroom doing her work,

2293
03:04:34,276 --> 03:04:43,823
And a group of girls barged into her classroom, went right up to her while she was sitting at her desk and antagonized her to start a fight.

2294
03:04:46,284 --> 03:04:47,725
She kept her hands to herself.

2295
03:04:48,346 --> 03:04:53,289
We would be having a much different conversation if my daughter was harmed physically.

2296
03:04:54,230 --> 03:04:57,672
This is all, you know, talk, talk, talk, talk.

2297
03:04:58,313 --> 03:05:01,355
But at some point, it's gonna become physical.

2298
03:05:02,840 --> 03:05:04,221
Um, so that was April.

2299
03:05:07,022 --> 03:05:11,784
Then we have so we figured okay, the summit, you know, summertime, everything's fine.

2300
03:05:12,504 --> 03:05:13,885
Go back to school September.

2301
03:05:15,425 --> 03:05:18,327
September really familiar September 28.

2302
03:05:18,767 --> 03:05:19,787
Another police report.

2303
03:05:21,108 --> 03:05:28,571
Officer Conway calls me and tells me what's going on at the school and now my daughter is being escorted to her classes.

2304
03:05:29,407 --> 03:05:32,169
because these girls are following her to her locker.

2305
03:05:32,449 --> 03:05:34,130
She doesn't even use the bathroom at school.

2306
03:05:35,110 --> 03:05:38,252
But last week she did because she's in the medical assisting program.

2307
03:05:38,772 --> 03:05:44,015
She went into the bathroom with her other medical assisting friends to change into their uniforms.

2308
03:05:45,956 --> 03:05:48,058
I call this one girl a ringleader.

2309
03:05:48,438 --> 03:05:53,020
She's not in the school right now, because once she turned 16, she was allowed to drop out.

2310
03:05:53,761 --> 03:05:54,101
Fine.

2311
03:05:56,042 --> 03:05:57,283
But she calls her

2312
03:05:57,987 --> 03:05:59,688
you know, gang of friends, if you will.

2313
03:06:00,508 --> 03:06:04,210
Hey, so and so, you know, follow her, follow her, follow her.

2314
03:06:05,011 --> 03:06:06,452
Many different names are on here.

2315
03:06:06,552 --> 03:06:07,332
I know they're minors.

2316
03:06:07,412 --> 03:06:09,994
I can't mention their names, but they are on the police reports.

2317
03:06:10,534 --> 03:06:15,216
They have it's it's sickening last week.

2318
03:06:15,357 --> 03:06:16,537
So that was September 29.

2319
03:06:20,059 --> 03:06:27,003
Just last week, a different batch of girls from this original ringleader sent

2320
03:06:27,865 --> 03:06:34,388
another group of girls into the bathroom and cornered her in there and tried to jump her.

2321
03:06:36,269 --> 03:06:37,590
So those girls were sent home.

2322
03:06:39,591 --> 03:06:41,492
And then the boys had a fight.

2323
03:06:41,832 --> 03:06:44,113
And then of course, retaliation happened yesterday.

2324
03:06:47,235 --> 03:06:51,777
I don't know what's going on in the bathrooms, but there's a lot of drug use in the school.

2325
03:06:52,958 --> 03:06:53,798
Everybody knows it.

2326
03:06:54,098 --> 03:06:57,380
These kids are in the bathroom doing drugs and whatever else they're doing.

2327
03:06:58,740 --> 03:06:59,940
Some of the drugs were laced.

2328
03:07:00,380 --> 03:07:02,781
I'm hearing that's why there were some overdoses.

2329
03:07:03,361 --> 03:07:04,962
I don't know that, it could be hearsay.

2330
03:07:05,922 --> 03:07:15,345
However, to get anything done, I can understand parents' frustrations on getting something on paper.

2331
03:07:16,065 --> 03:07:19,466
So I collected my three incident reports.

2332
03:07:20,766 --> 03:07:26,248
I went to the, Officer Conway gave them to me at the high school.

2333
03:07:27,045 --> 03:07:31,427
I then went to Metro Police Department to file a new report for a new incident.

2334
03:07:33,248 --> 03:07:38,030
And I went to the sample courthouse sample courthouse said they're juveniles, you got to go to the Cambridge courthouse.

2335
03:07:38,650 --> 03:07:40,651
I go to the Cambridge courthouse, where's your daughter?

2336
03:07:40,691 --> 03:07:41,672
I'm like, she's in school.

2337
03:07:41,732 --> 03:07:43,192
Well, you have to have your daughter with you.

2338
03:07:44,073 --> 03:07:46,794
It's very frustrating that nothing can be done immediately.

2339
03:07:46,814 --> 03:07:47,474
I get it.

2340
03:07:47,914 --> 03:07:51,956
But I know that a lot of parents probably don't want to go through that whole process of it.

2341
03:07:52,816 --> 03:07:55,057
But you have to, unfortunately.

2342
03:07:56,768 --> 03:08:00,129
So I get my police reports in order.

2343
03:08:00,169 --> 03:08:05,450
I go to the Cambridge courthouse, file my paperwork with them.

2344
03:08:05,950 --> 03:08:07,030
They give me a court date.

2345
03:08:08,051 --> 03:08:10,351
The girl and her mom show up about two hours late.

2346
03:08:10,411 --> 03:08:12,172
And then she tells the judge, hey, I gotta go.

2347
03:08:12,212 --> 03:08:13,512
I gotta go pick up my kid at home.

2348
03:08:14,432 --> 03:08:15,633
Yeah, that's not how it works.

2349
03:08:16,253 --> 03:08:19,914
You're here because you're harassing my daughter and many others.

2350
03:08:20,534 --> 03:08:22,254
This girl is a problem.

2351
03:08:22,894 --> 03:08:25,595
And so on all of her friends that are still in the school.

2352
03:08:26,678 --> 03:08:27,758
Why aren't they expelled?

2353
03:08:27,838 --> 03:08:28,959
Why aren't they suspended?

2354
03:08:29,099 --> 03:08:32,260
I get it, mass law, everybody's entitled to their education.

2355
03:08:32,961 --> 03:08:36,882
My daughter's entitled to an education and she's not a troublemaker.

2356
03:08:39,143 --> 03:08:41,404
She has never touched anybody in that school.

2357
03:08:41,424 --> 03:08:47,106
And I'll be damned if somebody puts a finger on her, because this would be a different conversation.

2358
03:08:47,887 --> 03:08:52,008
So then I get a court date, then it's, oh, let's try mediation.

2359
03:08:52,749 --> 03:08:56,250
Yeah, we tried that at school and the girl jumped over the desk

2360
03:08:56,935 --> 03:08:59,916
and try to attack the principal, okay?

2361
03:09:00,537 --> 03:09:14,743
So then last week, Mrs. Watha says to me, well, your daughter is the target because she's very nice, she's happy, these girls are jealous, she's very social, she's popular, I commend your daughter for staying strong.

2362
03:09:18,525 --> 03:09:22,106
But nothing's happening because this is still ongoing.

2363
03:09:22,126 --> 03:09:24,708
Yeah, that's great, she's a good kid, we all know that.

2364
03:09:25,623 --> 03:09:29,805
So why are the good kids being punished and why aren't the bad kids out of the school?

2365
03:09:31,106 --> 03:09:33,887
For example, a couple of them went over to the Tufts Curtis.

2366
03:09:33,927 --> 03:09:34,267
Guess what?

2367
03:09:34,307 --> 03:09:35,748
It didn't work out there for them either.

2368
03:09:36,808 --> 03:09:38,269
I don't care if they have problems at home.

2369
03:09:38,289 --> 03:09:39,269
We all have problems.

2370
03:09:40,250 --> 03:09:41,170
Don't bring it to school.

2371
03:09:41,330 --> 03:09:43,531
That's supposed to be their safe place.

2372
03:09:46,953 --> 03:09:47,813
Can't go to the bathroom.

2373
03:09:47,853 --> 03:09:49,254
My daughter doesn't go to the bathroom at school.

2374
03:09:49,474 --> 03:09:53,116
She holds it until, we pick her up and drop her off every single day.

2375
03:09:54,344 --> 03:09:58,806
She's never taken public transportation because you know what happens on the public transportation?

2376
03:09:59,246 --> 03:10:07,070
They're smoking, they're doing their thing, they're fighting, they're offloading the kids in Medford Square because there's a brawl on the bus.

2377
03:10:07,551 --> 03:10:09,632
They all have to get off the bus, go on another bus.

2378
03:10:09,952 --> 03:10:11,633
I don't want my daughter experiencing that.

2379
03:10:13,474 --> 03:10:22,178
So we go to mediation and we get the complaint for protection for harassment, a harassment prevention order.

2380
03:10:23,561 --> 03:10:29,106
I sign it, my husband signs it, my daughter signs it, the girl signs it, her mom signs it.

2381
03:10:29,846 --> 03:10:33,229
Two weeks later, the girl's harassing my daughter again.

2382
03:10:33,909 --> 03:10:41,936
And she's not even in the school, but she's taking pictures of her, taking screenshots of her, posting it on social media and saying nasty things about her.

2383
03:10:42,516 --> 03:10:43,597
So that's a violation.

2384
03:10:44,838 --> 03:10:45,579
Nothing happens.

2385
03:10:47,260 --> 03:10:50,523
So then we reach out to the superintendent

2386
03:10:54,774 --> 03:11:04,660
And they send me a 34 page pamphlet on bullying, investigation and response forms.

2387
03:11:05,700 --> 03:11:15,285
So this first seven pages that you have to fill out the bullying incident report, the police reports, I guess aren't enough.

2388
03:11:16,286 --> 03:11:20,628
And then there'll be a bullying investigation form, which

2389
03:11:21,962 --> 03:11:22,642
is two pages.

2390
03:11:22,702 --> 03:11:28,463
So I guess whoever this was handed to is supposed to fill this out to see what has been done.

2391
03:11:28,843 --> 03:11:33,984
Now this was passed in on Friday because this happened either Wednesday or Thursday last week.

2392
03:11:35,625 --> 03:11:39,045
And then there's going to be a plan.

2393
03:11:41,446 --> 03:11:42,226
What's the plan?

2394
03:11:43,066 --> 03:11:48,207
All this paperwork has done nothing, nothing, nothing at all.

2395
03:11:50,013 --> 03:11:52,675
There's married people that get restraining orders on each other.

2396
03:11:52,695 --> 03:11:54,076
They end up killing each other anyway.

2397
03:11:54,496 --> 03:11:56,117
The piece of paper isn't doing anything.

2398
03:11:58,138 --> 03:12:15,529
So I don't know what the answers are gonna be, but what's gonna happen is people are gonna start taking this into their own hands because the people that are supposed to be leaders in the community and our superintendent of schools, the administration, nobody wants to take responsibility.

2399
03:12:15,549 --> 03:12:19,812
I mean, how much do parents have to do?

2400
03:12:21,318 --> 03:12:24,820
You know, my daughter wasn't physically harmed.

2401
03:12:24,860 --> 03:12:25,440
Hers was.

2402
03:12:26,621 --> 03:12:28,022
We're in the same situation.

2403
03:12:28,222 --> 03:12:29,282
Tons of police reports.

2404
03:12:29,342 --> 03:12:31,663
And I only brought the ones that I had to bring.

2405
03:12:32,484 --> 03:12:33,264
You only need three.

2406
03:12:33,884 --> 03:12:34,845
I have probably 20.

2407
03:12:35,565 --> 03:12:38,366
She's got a whole bag full of paperwork.

2408
03:12:38,466 --> 03:12:39,207
It's all papers.

2409
03:12:39,427 --> 03:12:40,888
This is the bag I carry around.

2410
03:12:40,908 --> 03:12:42,388
This is my whole life right now.

2411
03:12:43,249 --> 03:12:45,970
All talk, talk, talk, no action at all.

2412
03:12:49,527 --> 03:12:50,468
I can't even imagine.

2413
03:12:50,488 --> 03:12:57,192
Three.

2414
03:12:58,253 --> 03:13:00,494
And of course my OCD, everything's color coded.

2415
03:13:00,514 --> 03:13:02,255
Four.

2416
03:13:04,537 --> 03:13:05,737
I don't want a pile that big.

2417
03:13:06,378 --> 03:13:07,819
I don't want it any thicker than this.

2418
03:13:11,761 --> 03:13:16,064
So we're, you know, as parents, you know, we do the best with our children.

2419
03:13:17,029 --> 03:13:18,630
My child is a straight A student.

2420
03:13:18,810 --> 03:13:19,911
She wants to go to college.

2421
03:13:19,951 --> 03:13:20,992
She wants to have a future.

2422
03:13:21,032 --> 03:13:22,192
She wants her education.

2423
03:13:22,813 --> 03:13:24,974
She doesn't want any of this other extra stuff.

2424
03:13:25,975 --> 03:13:33,139
And neither does, you know, I just don't understand why the bad kids are still allowed to come back to school.

2425
03:13:33,439 --> 03:13:33,839
You know what?

2426
03:13:33,879 --> 03:13:34,760
Because they're not bad.

2427
03:13:34,960 --> 03:13:38,042
They have unexpected behavior and adults aren't doing their job.

2428
03:13:39,863 --> 03:13:42,545
That's why adults aren't doing their job.

2429
03:13:43,145 --> 03:13:46,247
So all their unexpected behavior continues.

2430
03:13:47,652 --> 03:13:48,232
continues.

2431
03:13:49,013 --> 03:13:51,195
And yesterday was just like not correct.

2432
03:13:51,275 --> 03:13:52,516
You know, no, that's fine.

2433
03:13:53,616 --> 03:13:56,538
Yesterday, you know, you get a text from your child.

2434
03:13:56,578 --> 03:13:58,560
Hey, we're on lockdown for two hours.

2435
03:13:59,400 --> 03:14:00,301
School didn't even tell us.

2436
03:14:02,243 --> 03:14:04,884
I was at the school before some of the fire trucks.

2437
03:14:04,924 --> 03:14:07,807
And this is when I met Mr. Scott Kelly.

2438
03:14:08,727 --> 03:14:12,190
And, you know, I just thought he was I had no idea who anybody was.

2439
03:14:13,015 --> 03:14:20,300
But there were parents there and he's there in his hoodie and his shorts and we're just talking and I didn't have a clue to who he was.

2440
03:14:20,380 --> 03:14:22,141
He was painting his attic or something.

2441
03:14:22,201 --> 03:14:23,702
And I was like, wow, you know?

2442
03:14:23,822 --> 03:14:27,664
And then I see him here tonight and I'm like, oh, okay.

2443
03:14:29,305 --> 03:14:33,588
You know, but I spoke to him just like I spoke to Nicole.

2444
03:14:34,949 --> 03:14:36,190
We just shared our stories.

2445
03:14:36,657 --> 03:14:39,019
There was another mom there, her son's autistic.

2446
03:14:39,119 --> 03:14:40,900
They attacked him in the library.

2447
03:14:40,920 --> 03:14:44,603
This isn't isolated, is what I'm getting at.

2448
03:14:44,903 --> 03:14:46,585
This is a daily occurrence.

2449
03:14:47,785 --> 03:14:50,688
Every single day, if it's not my daughter, it's someone else's.

2450
03:14:51,468 --> 03:15:03,537
I don't know anything about much of the boy stuff, but the girls, there's groups of them that target the educated children, you know?

2451
03:15:05,307 --> 03:15:09,708
The parents that I go to at the courthouse, they're not doing anything.

2452
03:15:11,129 --> 03:15:13,109
Oh, that's okay, sweetheart, you don't have to go to school.

2453
03:15:13,410 --> 03:15:14,430
We'll send you somewhere else.

2454
03:15:15,330 --> 03:15:16,571
Where am I gonna send my daughter?

2455
03:15:16,811 --> 03:15:18,331
Why should I have to pull her out of school?

2456
03:15:18,411 --> 03:15:20,232
No, absolutely not.

2457
03:15:20,272 --> 03:15:21,752
She's there for a reason.

2458
03:15:22,472 --> 03:15:25,353
Excitement about being in the vocational.

2459
03:15:25,533 --> 03:15:29,174
You're getting a certificate when you graduate.

2460
03:15:29,614 --> 03:15:30,915
You can use that towards

2461
03:15:32,192 --> 03:15:36,275
going to college, she plays sports, she's very active, she does community service.

2462
03:15:37,296 --> 03:15:40,979
I mean, these other kids are not doing any of that.

2463
03:15:40,999 --> 03:15:42,341
They're not even going to school.

2464
03:15:43,762 --> 03:15:46,744
So that's my say.

2465
03:15:46,764 --> 03:15:50,928
I found out about this meeting from Nicole.

2466
03:15:51,348 --> 03:15:54,491
So I will probably be here more often than not.

2467
03:15:55,272 --> 03:16:00,236
Now that I know, I had to actually Google how to get here because never had to be here before.

2468
03:16:01,116 --> 03:16:06,238
but I'm here for Nicole, I'm here to speak on behalf of other parents as well.

2469
03:16:08,419 --> 03:16:09,079
So thank you.

2470
03:16:09,239 --> 03:16:09,639
Thank you.

2471
03:16:10,339 --> 03:16:10,999
Councilor Carvillo.

2472
03:16:11,260 --> 03:16:11,920
Thank you, Madam President.

2473
03:16:11,940 --> 03:16:14,121
Madam President, through you to the superintendent.

2474
03:16:15,941 --> 03:16:20,743
Do we know how many reports like this are throughout our school?

2475
03:16:21,363 --> 03:16:29,226
I mean, yesterday when I was there with Councilor Scott Pele, I heard the young lady telling Councilor Scott Pele about her incidents

2476
03:16:29,837 --> 03:16:39,704
with going to the police and believe it or not, I probably heard the same story from a half a dozen other people that were standing outside waiting for the drone saying they had all filed police reports.

2477
03:16:40,765 --> 03:16:44,268
How many police reports have been filed over the last year in the school?

2478
03:16:44,428 --> 03:16:46,870
We did have the council pass a resolution.

2479
03:16:46,890 --> 03:16:47,590
We voted on it.

2480
03:16:48,991 --> 03:16:52,594
The council two weeks ago and I did actually I called Chief Buckley as well.

2481
03:16:54,248 --> 03:16:58,712
I say I met half a dozen people outside what's what's on Councilor Scott Kelly yesterday.

2482
03:16:59,192 --> 03:17:02,535
And they were all saying the same thing that you know, they all they all have reports.

2483
03:17:02,955 --> 03:17:07,519
They will restraining orders and I don't know why they're not being enforced.

2484
03:17:08,239 --> 03:17:09,420
I mean, can we get a number?

2485
03:17:10,441 --> 03:17:15,265
The request is in and I get as we've learned tonight, sometimes those requests don't get where they're supposed to go.

2486
03:17:15,285 --> 03:17:18,648
So I have I did another request we won't get.

2487
03:17:20,240 --> 03:17:24,523
Sorry, just to add one thing, and I don't know if I had mentioned it to you, I think.

2488
03:17:24,903 --> 03:17:26,925
I can't keep track.

2489
03:17:27,105 --> 03:17:28,866
I can look at all my notes.

2490
03:17:29,286 --> 03:17:34,290
But the resolution had talked about incidents that Officer Conway could put together.

2491
03:17:34,310 --> 03:17:35,371
I believe it was 30 days.

2492
03:17:38,013 --> 03:17:42,396
And will that include incident reports within the school?

2493
03:17:42,496 --> 03:17:48,460
Not just the police reports, but student on student violence in the schools that's handled within

2494
03:17:48,883 --> 03:17:50,284
an assistant principal, a principal.

2495
03:17:50,304 --> 03:17:50,464
Okay.

2496
03:17:50,484 --> 03:17:55,688
I just want to make sure that that was all included, not just from the SRO because he would only have access.

2497
03:17:55,708 --> 03:17:57,489
I don't know what we'll get back, but that's okay.

2498
03:17:57,649 --> 03:17:58,470
Cause cause, okay.

2499
03:17:58,510 --> 03:18:02,733
Because, um, he can only produce the stuff from the police department.

2500
03:18:03,153 --> 03:18:03,574
So, all right.

2501
03:18:03,634 --> 03:18:03,874
Awesome.

2502
03:18:03,894 --> 03:18:04,454
Thank you so much.

2503
03:18:04,474 --> 03:18:06,056
Thank you.

2504
03:18:07,377 --> 03:18:08,057
Thank you.

2505
03:18:08,718 --> 03:18:12,100
Um, I, it's, it's hard to add anything after a story like that.

2506
03:18:12,120 --> 03:18:12,961
I don't have anything to add.

2507
03:18:13,001 --> 03:18:14,842
I just wanted to thank you for, for being here.

2508
03:18:14,882 --> 03:18:16,043
Thank you for sharing your story.

2509
03:18:16,739 --> 03:18:17,980
Um, I'm not a parent.

2510
03:18:18,040 --> 03:18:24,344
I can't fathom what it's like to be a parent and go through something like that, something that unfortunately a lot of families in our public school systems have to go through.

2511
03:18:25,024 --> 03:18:25,725
It's heartbreaking.

2512
03:18:25,745 --> 03:18:27,566
I just want to say, you know, our hearts go out to you.

2513
03:18:27,586 --> 03:18:28,167
Thank you for being here.

2514
03:18:29,808 --> 03:18:30,068
Thank you.

2515
03:18:30,128 --> 03:18:30,428
And I do.

2516
03:18:30,448 --> 03:18:34,210
Yeah, I think everyone is coming to speak for the first time tonight.

2517
03:18:34,250 --> 03:18:34,991
I know it's not easy.

2518
03:18:35,011 --> 03:18:39,534
I know it's really hard and I appreciate you taking the time of your night to come speak before us.

2519
03:18:39,594 --> 03:18:39,874
You know,

2520
03:18:44,652 --> 03:18:46,593
Sometimes they're 20 minutes, sometimes they're five hours.

2521
03:18:46,613 --> 03:18:47,554
You never know until you're here.

2522
03:18:49,835 --> 03:19:01,422
So, but I appreciate, and I think a lot of us that if we went to public schools, you know, I graduated 20 years ago, there were some of these, I didn't go to Medford High, I went to a different high school that had many of its own issues.

2523
03:19:02,342 --> 03:19:12,068
But I think it's very clear that some of us may have experienced stuff similar, but stuff has gotten to a level that I think is unimaginable for a lot of us that were in high school,

2524
03:19:12,985 --> 03:19:14,246
possibly even 10 years ago.

2525
03:19:14,266 --> 03:19:14,547
I don't know.

2526
03:19:14,727 --> 03:19:17,089
I think second smartphones get added.

2527
03:19:17,229 --> 03:19:19,472
It seems like stuff I can't even imagine.

2528
03:19:19,532 --> 03:19:23,356
So I really appreciate you coming out to talk.

2529
03:19:23,376 --> 03:19:24,157
My heart goes out to you.

2530
03:19:24,337 --> 03:19:30,343
I'm a mother of a very young child, but this is stuff that, of course, we're all thinking of constantly.

2531
03:19:30,423 --> 03:19:33,146
So I appreciate you taking the time to share your stories.

2532
03:19:34,395 --> 03:19:35,556
as a counselor and as a mother.

2533
03:19:35,756 --> 03:19:36,237
So thank you.

2534
03:19:37,658 --> 03:19:41,602
I do see counselors saying, and then I'm going to go to one person on zoom and then we'll come back to Mr. Okay.

2535
03:19:42,322 --> 03:19:45,485
Councilor saying bears will go to zoom and we'll come back to Mr. South.

2536
03:19:49,131 --> 03:19:49,491
Thank you.

2537
03:19:49,852 --> 03:20:00,023
Um, I also wanted to thank the parents for coming up and telling you the stories and I hadn't heard the story before.

2538
03:20:00,363 --> 03:20:07,791
And I think President Morello, you put it well that even though I even though I was there five years ago, I think things have

2539
03:20:08,972 --> 03:20:15,994
you know, things are slightly different now and smartphones and COVID and all of that changes everything as well.

2540
03:20:16,034 --> 03:20:19,895
So it's actually, it's really helpful to hear that perspective.

2541
03:20:22,015 --> 03:20:22,355
Thank you.

2542
03:20:23,016 --> 03:20:23,696
President Behrs.

2543
03:20:24,316 --> 03:20:25,136
Thank you, Madam President.

2544
03:20:25,176 --> 03:20:25,596
Yeah.

2545
03:20:25,856 --> 03:20:28,277
I also want to want to thank you for coming out to everyone who spoke tonight.

2546
03:20:28,817 --> 03:20:28,997
Ms.

2547
03:20:29,037 --> 03:20:31,018
Ripley, you were really good.

2548
03:20:33,525 --> 03:20:40,147
And the students who spoke last night as well, I think that that takes a lot of courage because you're going back there and you know what it's like.

2549
03:20:40,548 --> 03:20:48,450
And I just want to say to President Morrell's point, I graduated 2011 from Medford High School, my sister 2016.

2550
03:20:50,951 --> 03:21:00,234
And there were clicks and bullying and police reports and issues that we faced in our time at Medford High School.

2551
03:21:04,169 --> 03:21:06,617
I think, again, there's not much more I can add.

2552
03:21:08,085 --> 03:21:09,446
People have been experiencing this.

2553
03:21:09,646 --> 03:21:11,746
It's clearly worse now than it's ever been before.

2554
03:21:11,766 --> 03:21:14,567
And I think we've talked about a lot of the reasons that that's true.

2555
03:21:16,048 --> 03:21:31,833
And this council and the school committee, and I think everyone involved is, you know, Mr. Ripley talked about resources, seeing every day the teachers and staff not having the resources that they're asking for to help address these problems.

2556
03:21:31,873 --> 03:21:34,554
And I think, again, that's something that for me personally, I think is,

2557
03:21:36,695 --> 03:21:39,736
What I'm going to keep hammering on is trying to get more resources into the building.

2558
03:21:40,096 --> 03:21:40,436
Thank you.

2559
03:21:40,716 --> 03:21:40,996
Thank you.

2560
03:21:41,556 --> 03:21:43,956
I'm going to Jada Higgins on Zoom.

2561
03:21:44,096 --> 03:21:45,016
I will unmute you.

2562
03:21:45,036 --> 03:21:46,917
Name and address for the record, please.

2563
03:21:46,937 --> 03:21:52,098
And I also do want to know if there's anyone who does not feel comfortable giving their address, they can message it to the clerk privately.

2564
03:21:52,238 --> 03:21:56,158
So going to Jada Higgins, if you are still there.

2565
03:21:56,178 --> 03:21:57,379
I know your hand's been up for a while.

2566
03:22:03,740 --> 03:22:04,740
Trying to unmute you.

2567
03:22:08,095 --> 03:22:11,497
All right, we'll come back to you.

2568
03:22:11,677 --> 03:22:14,938
If you're on zoom your hands up and find your way back to your screen.

2569
03:22:15,458 --> 03:22:16,039
Mr. South.

2570
03:22:17,459 --> 03:22:18,460
You know, just for the record, please.

2571
03:22:19,600 --> 03:22:21,501
Stephen South 106 Damon Road.

2572
03:22:23,522 --> 03:22:25,023
Good afternoon or evening now.

2573
03:22:26,323 --> 03:22:30,285
Madam Chairman, members of the city council, Mr. City Clerk.

2574
03:22:31,463 --> 03:22:35,668
Um, I'm also the secretary treasurer of Teamsters Local 25.

2575
03:22:35,788 --> 03:22:45,539
We represent all of the Medford public schools, custodians, security staff, assistant principals, coordinators, directors and others.

2576
03:22:46,761 --> 03:22:52,267
Um, I've heard a lot tonight about what happened 30 years ago, what happened

2577
03:22:53,112 --> 03:23:00,201
when when other people were kids that and I, I wrote down some of the things were said this is a national issue.

2578
03:23:00,221 --> 03:23:01,983
This has been going on for years.

2579
03:23:02,964 --> 03:23:07,891
There's been 30 years of issue issues school violence has been around for a while.

2580
03:23:07,911 --> 03:23:10,214
I was assaulted in middle school.

2581
03:23:10,234 --> 03:23:11,215
I mean,

2582
03:23:11,655 --> 03:23:14,077
None of that is relevant to what's going on now.

2583
03:23:14,418 --> 03:23:22,945
So I agree with someone said earlier, we're talking about right here, right now, and issues with the children in this community not being safe.

2584
03:23:23,065 --> 03:23:24,907
No one cares what happened 30 years ago.

2585
03:23:25,387 --> 03:23:27,389
It's not relevant to what we're talking about.

2586
03:23:30,111 --> 03:23:34,435
I hear people comparing what's going on now to many years ago.

2587
03:23:34,975 --> 03:23:41,798
I've represented employees in this city and this school system since 2007 and worked very closely.

2588
03:23:41,838 --> 03:23:46,340
I'm at the high school every week for different various reasons.

2589
03:23:47,220 --> 03:23:59,625
But like I always do when I come here and I've come to talk about these issues in the last year, multiple times at city council, multiple times at the school committee, I've had many in-person meetings at

2590
03:24:00,200 --> 03:24:06,103
the high school with central administration officials regarding security issues.

2591
03:24:06,984 --> 03:24:11,026
Now I wanna start giving you some facts and then I'm going to give you some facts in writing.

2592
03:24:13,407 --> 03:24:16,629
Number one, there was an overdose yesterday, which is disturbing to me.

2593
03:24:18,170 --> 03:24:22,753
There are guns and knives in Medford High School, and I've been saying that for years.

2594
03:24:23,933 --> 03:24:26,115
And yesterday, the stabbing,

2595
03:24:28,036 --> 03:24:29,697
prove that that is true.

2596
03:24:29,877 --> 03:24:31,979
So you can bang the gavel, but that's a fact.

2597
03:24:32,119 --> 03:24:33,500
There was a stabbing yesterday.

2598
03:24:34,801 --> 03:24:41,325
There's hundreds of kids that roam the halls on any given day, and loiter in the bathrooms.

2599
03:24:42,406 --> 03:24:50,372
There's a group of kids that congregate in the bathrooms and wait for unsuspecting students to come in, and they bully them or beat them up or threaten them.

2600
03:24:50,592 --> 03:24:54,875
That happens often, all the time, and the administration's aware of it.

2601
03:24:56,015 --> 03:25:04,342
School employees, and I've talked to dozens of my members in the last two days, you know, checking on them, seeing what's going on.

2602
03:25:05,423 --> 03:25:11,407
And many of them have expressed to me, these are the employees of Medford Public Schools, that they're afraid.

2603
03:25:11,788 --> 03:25:13,129
They're afraid to go to work.

2604
03:25:14,990 --> 03:25:16,511
School employees are being threatened.

2605
03:25:16,952 --> 03:25:18,593
School employees are being assaulted.

2606
03:25:20,205 --> 03:25:25,087
Okay, there are fights and assaults every day at Medford High School.

2607
03:25:25,127 --> 03:25:37,351
I can tell you recently I was at a meeting, a security meeting by the way, and one of my security staff was there and twice in 20 minutes she got called away on a radio to altercations.

2608
03:25:38,091 --> 03:25:43,894
This is a woman and evidently they want her to break up fights and she has no formal training.

2609
03:25:45,714 --> 03:25:47,715
There's graffiti daily in the bathrooms.

2610
03:25:48,585 --> 03:25:52,127
There's no documentation of this.

2611
03:25:52,907 --> 03:25:55,488
The staff are just told to paint over it.

2612
03:25:56,229 --> 03:26:02,272
And I've instructed my members, your employees, to now take pictures of it and document these things.

2613
03:26:02,332 --> 03:26:03,993
And we'll get into reporting in a minute.

2614
03:26:05,974 --> 03:26:14,318
Part of the problem with these assaults on staff and on students is there's a policy that the staff aren't allowed to touch the students.

2615
03:26:14,852 --> 03:26:18,234
So when there's a fight, you're not supposed to break it up.

2616
03:26:18,675 --> 03:26:21,356
And this is being reiterated to my members.

2617
03:26:23,858 --> 03:26:24,999
Talking about reporting.

2618
03:26:25,499 --> 03:26:27,420
There's incidents every day at the high school.

2619
03:26:27,460 --> 03:26:39,468
There's no formal reporting system at the high school for the incidents where students are telling my members and school employees to F themselves, F off every single day.

2620
03:26:40,809 --> 03:26:42,590
They don't listen to them.

2621
03:26:42,910 --> 03:26:44,151
There's no consequences.

2622
03:26:45,597 --> 03:26:56,204
And when I talk to my members, which are your employees, about how these are being reported, they talk to their superiors and they say, OK, and that's it.

2623
03:26:56,284 --> 03:26:58,385
They're not asked to fill out forms.

2624
03:26:59,206 --> 03:27:02,408
So we created our own reporting form.

2625
03:27:04,925 --> 03:27:15,354
Teamsters Local 25 Employee Work-Related Incident Report, which now our members, effective recently, are filling these out anytime there's an issue.

2626
03:27:15,434 --> 03:27:20,818
So we're not gonna allow the central administration anymore to brush all these issues every day under the rug.

2627
03:27:21,139 --> 03:27:28,044
We are going to track them because the school committee and the school administration is not tracking them, that's a fact.

2628
03:27:29,345 --> 03:27:31,047
Now we wanna talk about for a second,

2629
03:27:32,549 --> 03:27:36,233
and I know it's getting late, but I wanna talk about how long this has been going on.

2630
03:27:36,613 --> 03:27:41,117
I talked about coming to the meetings and speaking to the council and the school committee.

2631
03:27:42,218 --> 03:27:44,681
I brought an agenda today, which I'd like to hand out.

2632
03:27:46,082 --> 03:27:48,164
And this is from exactly one year ago.

2633
03:27:51,567 --> 03:27:57,353
To your point, Mr. South, I think people were trying to set context when they spoke about previous years, just as you're trying to set context now.

2634
03:27:57,713 --> 03:27:58,813
Now, this is relevant.

2635
03:27:58,953 --> 03:28:00,394
So if you give me a second.

2636
03:28:00,634 --> 03:28:02,094
As was what they said before.

2637
03:28:02,234 --> 03:28:03,094
As was what they said before.

2638
03:28:03,114 --> 03:28:05,435
This is a meeting about security.

2639
03:28:05,575 --> 03:28:06,855
As was what they said before.

2640
03:28:06,915 --> 03:28:08,056
I want to make that clear.

2641
03:28:08,096 --> 03:28:09,596
Yeah, you make clear whatever you want.

2642
03:28:09,636 --> 03:28:10,396
Point of information.

2643
03:28:10,436 --> 03:28:11,156
Vice President Behrs.

2644
03:28:11,176 --> 03:28:12,097
Thank you, Madam President.

2645
03:28:13,397 --> 03:28:20,619
The idea that we shouldn't contextualize an issue and analyze it to find solutions.

2646
03:28:21,239 --> 03:28:23,299
I mean, yeah, what happened in the past is relevant.

2647
03:28:23,339 --> 03:28:24,260
You're doing it right now.

2648
03:28:24,280 --> 03:28:25,340
So I just want to make that point.

2649
03:28:26,957 --> 03:28:33,539
This is a meeting in the heading says City of Medford School Security Issues December 16, 2021.

2650
03:28:35,720 --> 03:28:36,940
One year ago exactly.

2651
03:28:37,320 --> 03:28:38,481
And there is a point to this.

2652
03:28:39,161 --> 03:28:40,681
There's 13 bullet points on this.

2653
03:28:40,761 --> 03:28:46,323
This is a meeting with top central administration officials, myself and my two stewards.

2654
03:28:48,543 --> 03:28:51,365
Kevin and Bill who is now retired.

2655
03:28:51,906 --> 03:28:54,107
Number one, we have zero security guards.

2656
03:28:54,187 --> 03:28:56,709
Bill Mosaic is retiring after 47 years.

2657
03:28:57,470 --> 03:29:03,014
Today, we still have zero security guards because that position has now been eliminated as of 2022.

2658
03:29:03,074 --> 03:29:07,137
That is very relevant to what we're talking about today.

2659
03:29:07,458 --> 03:29:09,959
Number two, the city's having monitors.

2660
03:29:10,300 --> 03:29:12,221
These are people that sit at the front desk.

2661
03:29:12,782 --> 03:29:13,902
A few of them are in their 70s.

2662
03:29:15,287 --> 03:29:19,529
perform security guard work from monitor pay $17.50 an hour.

2663
03:29:20,469 --> 03:29:26,091
Number three, and by the way, there's still $17.50 an hour because our contract's been expired over a year.

2664
03:29:27,092 --> 03:29:33,254
Number three, no security training is being provided to monitors who are being asked to perform security guard functions.

2665
03:29:33,874 --> 03:29:36,515
That was a year ago to this day, this is relevant.

2666
03:29:37,176 --> 03:29:40,417
They've hired four new security monitors this school year.

2667
03:29:40,990 --> 03:29:44,155
Zero training, not one speck of training, nothing.

2668
03:29:44,736 --> 03:29:45,437
That's relevant.

2669
03:29:46,879 --> 03:29:54,190
Number four, it says the city never replaced Joe Misuraca school security monitor that retired before the school year began.

2670
03:29:54,650 --> 03:29:56,373
We're shorthanded in the monitor group.

2671
03:29:56,918 --> 03:29:58,998
It's relevant because today we're still shorthanded.

2672
03:29:59,018 --> 03:30:00,099
There's still vacancies.

2673
03:30:00,539 --> 03:30:01,699
We're not fully staffed.

2674
03:30:02,459 --> 03:30:04,100
And that's because of the poor pay.

2675
03:30:04,520 --> 03:30:08,441
Number five, the schools are unsafe due to lack of security.

2676
03:30:08,961 --> 03:30:12,261
No guards and no school resource officer.

2677
03:30:12,281 --> 03:30:21,804
At that time last year, we had no school resource officer because he was out injured and the school committee and the administration chose not to replace him.

2678
03:30:22,184 --> 03:30:23,684
So we had no security guards.

2679
03:30:25,274 --> 03:30:26,655
and no police in the school.

2680
03:30:27,595 --> 03:30:37,179
Number six, after school security at door 31 has been canceled since school has been back to full-time in-person learning.

2681
03:30:37,999 --> 03:30:40,640
In nice weather, the door is propped open with a cone.

2682
03:30:41,580 --> 03:30:45,842
In the cold weather, it is left unlocked and anyone can walk in uncontested.

2683
03:30:46,102 --> 03:30:49,303
Can I ask, when you talk about security issues like that, you not be so specific.

2684
03:30:49,743 --> 03:30:51,064
It makes it more vulnerable and dangerous.

2685
03:30:51,104 --> 03:30:52,124
Well, it's a fact.

2686
03:30:52,164 --> 03:30:54,365
We used to, for many years, we had security

2687
03:30:54,744 --> 03:31:01,406
at the back door anytime there were school activities going on, the school committee canceled it.

2688
03:31:02,566 --> 03:31:09,168
It's not the dangerous situation is being caused by the school committee and the central administration.

2689
03:31:09,228 --> 03:31:17,510
Number seven, the kids have been coming increasingly bold since the city stopped suspensions and expulsions this school year.

2690
03:31:17,930 --> 03:31:24,272
Example, a student recently told Janet who's a monitor to suck his blank

2691
03:31:24,992 --> 03:31:26,732
when she told him to go back to class.

2692
03:31:26,792 --> 03:31:29,213
There was no discipline for that.

2693
03:31:29,253 --> 03:31:31,694
That happens every day, every single day.

2694
03:31:31,714 --> 03:31:33,574
And that's two today, very relevant.

2695
03:31:33,874 --> 03:31:41,256
Number eight, there's an extraordinary amount of violence in the schools, on the buses and at Playstead Park after school.

2696
03:31:41,576 --> 03:31:45,817
This is due to number one through six above, not COVID.

2697
03:31:48,618 --> 03:31:54,659
Number nine, anyone such as kids that don't attend Medford High School can walk right into the school in the morning

2698
03:31:55,018 --> 03:31:57,020
as the students don't have to show IDs.

2699
03:31:57,440 --> 03:31:59,282
The doors are open, everyone walks right in.

2700
03:31:59,322 --> 03:32:00,924
There's one person at the front desk.

2701
03:32:01,604 --> 03:32:05,288
Number 10, there are not metal detectors in the high school.

2702
03:32:05,468 --> 03:32:07,149
We've been talking about this for years.

2703
03:32:07,770 --> 03:32:13,335
And I know that last night after I left, people were saying from the school committee, this would take too long.

2704
03:32:13,916 --> 03:32:16,058
Well, I don't care how long it takes.

2705
03:32:16,663 --> 03:32:21,306
When people are bringing weapons into the schools, there should be metal detectors.

2706
03:32:21,667 --> 03:32:28,271
And I know that there's talk in the State House right now of rolling that out in parts of Massachusetts.

2707
03:32:29,152 --> 03:32:31,333
Number 11, no training is being provided.

2708
03:32:32,794 --> 03:32:38,719
As detailed in Article 23, our employees are not being provided the tools to perform their jobs to the best of their ability.

2709
03:32:38,979 --> 03:32:41,501
Again, zero training to the new employees.

2710
03:32:41,981 --> 03:32:43,302
So when people talk about,

2711
03:32:44,888 --> 03:32:51,314
I heard last night school committee members talking about how amazing of a job the security people and other people did.

2712
03:32:51,694 --> 03:32:55,697
Well, it's obviously instinct because it's not from training and they did do a great job.

2713
03:32:56,098 --> 03:33:07,668
And I commend all the teachers and staff that operated and conducted themselves in an amazing fashion yesterday to keep the kids safe, but it's not from training.

2714
03:33:08,745 --> 03:33:19,367
Number 12, in years past, when the city has had security drills, they do not include the security monitors or custodians, even though they are the first line of defense in an emergency.

2715
03:33:21,088 --> 03:33:24,549
And number 13, there's no phone in the custodial break room.

2716
03:33:25,729 --> 03:33:31,450
When the radios are down, just like yesterday, they can't communicate with management as cell phones don't work in the high school.

2717
03:33:31,910 --> 03:33:34,691
So the reason I gave this document, this is a meeting we had

2718
03:33:35,276 --> 03:33:36,377
One year ago, exactly.

2719
03:33:36,577 --> 03:33:37,778
We've had meetings since then.

2720
03:33:37,798 --> 03:33:42,421
I've spoken at the meetings since then and exactly nothing has been done.

2721
03:33:42,461 --> 03:33:49,266
Not one through 13, not one single bullet point has been addressed.

2722
03:33:49,807 --> 03:33:53,850
Meaning that obviously people aren't doing their jobs.

2723
03:33:54,070 --> 03:33:57,332
So you heard earlier, people should step up or step down.

2724
03:33:57,392 --> 03:33:58,093
That's a fact.

2725
03:33:58,854 --> 03:34:00,615
And there's an election in less than a year.

2726
03:34:00,675 --> 03:34:01,756
And I know this community,

2727
03:34:02,783 --> 03:34:05,804
will force that issue if things aren't done correctly.

2728
03:34:05,944 --> 03:34:08,025
So I'll end with this.

2729
03:34:11,506 --> 03:34:18,609
The most disturbing thing I saw last night was the lack of compassion and empathy for the families and students in the city of Medford.

2730
03:34:18,989 --> 03:34:30,713
You had parents that were here that were dealt with petrified students yesterday, upset families, parents that drove to the high school and sat outside for hours just to make sure their kids were safe.

2731
03:34:31,740 --> 03:34:36,163
school committee members yesterday arguing with parents at the microphone.

2732
03:34:36,543 --> 03:34:42,307
I saw one school committee member doing the hand gesture and saying blah, blah, blah from the seat.

2733
03:34:42,867 --> 03:34:43,968
That's disrespectful.

2734
03:34:44,608 --> 03:34:51,593
And you hear the same people talking about community and being in unity and coming together to find solutions.

2735
03:34:52,273 --> 03:34:58,237
Well, lead by example, show some sympathy and empathy to these families

2736
03:34:59,149 --> 03:35:02,851
that were literally afraid whether their child was gonna come home yesterday.

2737
03:35:03,152 --> 03:35:17,041
And you see the news every day, the shootings and stabbings all over the country, and have a little tact and show some respect to the people that elected you to your positions.

2738
03:35:18,221 --> 03:35:26,927
So the last thing I'll say is this, there's been a lot of talk last night, a lot of talk tonight, but what everyone really wants to see in this community

2739
03:35:27,536 --> 03:35:34,458
especially the families and the students and people's neighbors and everybody, they wanna see action.

2740
03:35:34,958 --> 03:35:37,139
Let's hire some security guards.

2741
03:35:37,179 --> 03:35:37,879
Let's bring them back.

2742
03:35:37,899 --> 03:35:39,299
We used to have over a dozen of them.

2743
03:35:39,319 --> 03:35:43,620
We used to have a security guard or more than one in every single school.

2744
03:35:43,760 --> 03:35:46,261
Now we have zero in any of the schools.

2745
03:35:46,921 --> 03:35:48,962
Let's have more school resource officers.

2746
03:35:49,262 --> 03:35:50,822
Let's have more police in the community.

2747
03:35:51,103 --> 03:35:56,344
We're severely short-staffed in police and fire and DPW and teachers.

2748
03:35:56,857 --> 03:36:00,178
All over the community, every position is short-staffed.

2749
03:36:01,358 --> 03:36:08,279
Let's fully fund these positions that matter most to keep the community, especially the children, safe.

2750
03:36:09,599 --> 03:36:10,579
I want to see action.

2751
03:36:11,320 --> 03:36:12,160
Talk is great.

2752
03:36:12,400 --> 03:36:13,660
It's great at the water cooler.

2753
03:36:13,680 --> 03:36:14,920
It's great at the coffee shop.

2754
03:36:15,300 --> 03:36:16,220
I want to see action.

2755
03:36:16,280 --> 03:36:17,701
The families want to see action.

2756
03:36:18,221 --> 03:36:24,902
I respectfully ask all of you to do what you can in your capacity, and I know you're not members of the school committee,

2757
03:36:25,715 --> 03:36:36,263
but use your power and your influence and your skills that you have many and find ways to put action in place, not just talk.

2758
03:36:36,603 --> 03:36:38,965
And I thank you all for your kind attention.

2759
03:36:39,726 --> 03:36:40,486
This is embarrassing.

2760
03:36:40,687 --> 03:36:41,988
Thank you, Madam President.

2761
03:36:42,788 --> 03:36:43,909
Thank you, Mr. South.

2762
03:36:44,109 --> 03:36:51,095
I appreciate acknowledging the national scope of the issue and the need for significant funding considering the massive underfunding of our city government.

2763
03:36:51,755 --> 03:36:55,078
I just had one question, which is who wrote this document?

2764
03:36:58,235 --> 03:37:04,837
I did and I presented it to all the administration officials at Medford High School on that date for the meeting that we held.

2765
03:37:05,817 --> 03:37:06,397
I drafted it.

2766
03:37:06,477 --> 03:37:06,817
Thank you.

2767
03:37:07,438 --> 03:37:09,158
I'm going to go to some folks on Zoom and then I'll come.

2768
03:37:09,698 --> 03:37:12,459
So going to Tony Tanks, name and address for the record, please.

2769
03:37:13,739 --> 03:37:17,060
Hi, Tony Puccio, Canada Street, Medford Mass.

2770
03:37:18,641 --> 03:37:22,342
I know a lot of what I have to say is probably better said in front of the school committee,

2771
03:37:23,538 --> 03:37:27,842
This is an opportunity that was presented by Councilor Scott Pelley last night.

2772
03:37:27,862 --> 03:37:28,903
So I'm gonna take advantage of it.

2773
03:37:29,003 --> 03:37:31,865
And I have a feeling there's gonna be a few people on the committee watching anyway.

2774
03:37:31,905 --> 03:37:39,772
So I don't believe for a second, any of the school committee members actually wanted this to happen, this incident, but it happened.

2775
03:37:40,673 --> 03:37:42,514
It happened under their watch.

2776
03:37:42,794 --> 03:37:47,739
It happened in spite of and in line with the policy they wrote and passed.

2777
03:37:48,880 --> 03:37:49,280
It happened

2778
03:37:52,302 --> 03:37:59,366
even though all the warnings that many of us have given them repeatedly, it still happens.

2779
03:37:59,746 --> 03:38:04,289
The school committee went to self-defense mode and self-preservation mode last night.

2780
03:38:04,509 --> 03:38:10,573
And it was in no way conducive to the situation that they and us, the community members are in.

2781
03:38:11,812 --> 03:38:18,273
I do commend the committee for lifting the new rules, which are obnoxiously restrictive to community participation.

2782
03:38:18,353 --> 03:38:20,194
So for that, I'm thankful.

2783
03:38:20,594 --> 03:38:24,774
There's no study that needs to be done that can replace time-tested methods and common sense.

2784
03:38:25,695 --> 03:38:32,776
Kids need structure, they need guidance, they need discipline, and they need to experience the consequences that come from the behaviors that warrant it.

2785
03:38:34,036 --> 03:38:39,757
One of the most important yet least mentioned factors I've noted while observing the discussion surrounding this trend of violence

2786
03:38:40,285 --> 03:38:43,406
in schools is the lack of attention given to parental responsibilities.

2787
03:38:44,586 --> 03:38:45,887
Where are the parents during all this?

2788
03:38:46,267 --> 03:38:50,308
Are they being held accountable for the actions of their children, or for the most part, minors?

2789
03:38:51,168 --> 03:39:00,871
If the school system is serious about correcting this climate of violence, then are there any plans to put in place that hold parents accountable for the behavior of their children?

2790
03:39:02,772 --> 03:39:05,953
It's not a school's primary function to be the disciplinarian.

2791
03:39:06,193 --> 03:39:08,934
Schools and faculty need to educate

2792
03:39:09,321 --> 03:39:10,362
Parents need to parent.

2793
03:39:11,282 --> 03:39:14,584
Parents of offenders need to be part of the solution when dispensing punishment.

2794
03:39:15,404 --> 03:39:20,807
And along with punishment, there needs to be a way to track and determine if patterns are developing that can be addressed.

2795
03:39:21,867 --> 03:39:23,828
There are many community members that have great ideas.

2796
03:39:24,548 --> 03:39:29,071
They're not guaranteed solutions, but who knows something might be worthy of further conversation.

2797
03:39:29,591 --> 03:39:30,571
And this study won't cost $50,000.

2798
03:39:32,382 --> 03:39:43,469
That plan should include immediate implementation and has to be addressed like an assembly or other means where students are made aware of the rules and clear consequences for further refractions.

2799
03:39:45,151 --> 03:39:51,875
I try to be as active as I can as a vocational school graduate, a night school teacher, and more importantly, for the sake of my child's education.

2800
03:39:52,436 --> 03:40:00,501
And I've heard from teachers, one of which whom, when I asked, what do you think is a good, solid way to help prevent, one good, solid way to help prevent some of this violence?

2801
03:40:00,989 --> 03:40:02,730
And their answer was a pretty attainable one.

2802
03:40:03,370 --> 03:40:07,591
They suggested placing cameras at the entrance points to every bathroom in the school.

2803
03:40:08,371 --> 03:40:17,034
Even if it's not a full-time monitored camera, having a record of who enters and exits the restrooms would certainly make wrongdoers think twice about causing trouble.

2804
03:40:17,774 --> 03:40:23,056
My own child would have benefited from this when an incident took place that several bathrooms throughout the school that affected her.

2805
03:40:23,656 --> 03:40:27,617
It would have been a lot easier to identify the perpetrators.

2806
03:40:29,598 --> 03:40:30,458
We've heard this before.

2807
03:40:31,151 --> 03:40:32,611
Never let a good crisis go to waste.

2808
03:40:33,312 --> 03:40:35,972
MedFed has enough money when it comes to school safety.

2809
03:40:36,252 --> 03:40:37,813
There can be no higher priority.

2810
03:40:39,013 --> 03:40:47,015
As councilors stated, funds need to be reallocated and an in-depth conversation needs to be had to figure out what is more important than safety.

2811
03:40:48,015 --> 03:40:56,017
In closing, I'm left to wonder if the funds allocated to change the name of the Columbus school was enough to make the parents of the stabbing victim or the Brantley family feel any safer.

2812
03:40:56,957 --> 03:40:58,298
Step up or step down.

2813
03:40:59,098 --> 03:40:59,378
Thank you.

2814
03:41:01,604 --> 03:41:04,165
Are you going to Nadine on zoom?

2815
03:41:04,746 --> 03:41:05,886
Name and address for the record, please.

2816
03:41:11,029 --> 03:41:12,610
Nadine Moretti, Birgit Ev.

2817
03:41:13,050 --> 03:41:17,093
Thank you, President Morrell and City Council.

2818
03:41:17,533 --> 03:41:18,013
Can you hear me?

2819
03:41:18,914 --> 03:41:19,614
Yes, we can hear you.

2820
03:41:19,634 --> 03:41:20,194
Okay, great.

2821
03:41:20,314 --> 03:41:20,935
Just want to make sure.

2822
03:41:20,975 --> 03:41:21,295
Thank you.

2823
03:41:21,635 --> 03:41:30,240
I just want to say first of all, thank you so much to Councilor Scarpelli for putting forth this resolution and for all of you listening to

2824
03:41:31,165 --> 03:41:50,256
him, his supporters, the parents, students, people on Zoom, people that spoke last night, we're all trying to be unified and united in fighting and being behind the mothers and families that are going through the hell they're going through, that have spoken over and over.

2825
03:41:51,057 --> 03:41:58,421
And I just want to say that seeing some responses by, you know, Councilor Behrs, Councilor Sang,

2826
03:41:59,711 --> 03:42:10,680
I don't feel like anybody really, except for Councilor Knight, Kerr of Yellow, supported Councilor Scarpelli in what is such a simple solution.

2827
03:42:11,381 --> 03:42:13,262
It's such a huge problem.

2828
03:42:13,302 --> 03:42:19,468
And I think it's not showing anybody that they're united or behind their fellow councilor.

2829
03:42:19,828 --> 03:42:25,613
You can have different ideas, but I haven't seen one iota of support for him.

2830
03:42:27,667 --> 03:42:29,148
I just find it mind boggling.

2831
03:42:29,208 --> 03:42:38,792
And I think that the only thing that should matter at this point is the safety of the students at Medford High School, period, end of story.

2832
03:42:39,512 --> 03:42:48,876
So I'm gonna reiterate what Tony just said, and have the words of the brave young woman last night, step up or step down, and that's it.

2833
03:42:49,416 --> 03:42:54,878
So again, thank you, Councilor Scarpelli, for your amazing resolution and everybody else.

2834
03:42:55,619 --> 03:42:56,099
Thanks a lot.

2835
03:42:57,873 --> 03:43:01,254
Thank you, going to Mr. Castagnetti on Zoom.

2836
03:43:01,594 --> 03:43:03,375
Just gonna step away from the chair briefly.

2837
03:43:03,395 --> 03:43:07,096
Hello.

2838
03:43:10,897 --> 03:43:11,397
Good evening.

2839
03:43:12,517 --> 03:43:14,938
Go ahead and name and address for the record, Andrew.

2840
03:43:15,898 --> 03:43:16,599
Good evening.

2841
03:43:17,259 --> 03:43:18,439
Maybe it's a bad evening.

2842
03:43:18,919 --> 03:43:21,020
It's Andrew P. Castagnetti.

2843
03:43:24,312 --> 03:43:28,415
What the hell happened to an abnormal world?

2844
03:43:29,836 --> 03:43:31,437
It's just insanity.

2845
03:43:32,377 --> 03:43:33,958
I have three simple solutions.

2846
03:43:35,679 --> 03:43:45,726
My first solution is to send George Soros back to Hungary, but he is banned from his home country.

2847
03:43:45,766 --> 03:43:47,187
Let's keep it on topic.

2848
03:43:49,020 --> 03:43:53,223
I'm on topic, it's part of the problem, there's no respect, including the parents.

2849
03:43:53,723 --> 03:44:04,069
Number two solution, sir, Meffitt High School must be policed and our laws be enforced to the fullest.

2850
03:44:06,370 --> 03:44:17,817
And third and last, leaders should fall on the sword and we must hire good leaders with simple common sense, period.

2851
03:44:18,693 --> 03:44:22,234
In other words, talk softly, but carry a big stick.

2852
03:44:23,755 --> 03:44:24,395
We need help.

2853
03:44:26,096 --> 03:44:28,717
We need leaders, but we get gamblers instead.

2854
03:44:29,017 --> 03:44:30,517
Please help the people.

2855
03:44:30,918 --> 03:44:32,318
Protect and serve.

2856
03:44:34,699 --> 03:44:35,459
Thank you, Andrew.

2857
03:44:36,600 --> 03:44:37,800
Thank you, Mr. Orlando.

2858
03:44:40,101 --> 03:44:41,341
Name and address for the record, please.

2859
03:44:41,822 --> 03:44:44,122
Thank you, Richard Orlando, Winford Way.

2860
03:44:46,146 --> 03:44:47,067
I went to school with Andrew.

2861
03:44:47,087 --> 03:44:49,208
We never got in trouble because we were always playing baseball.

2862
03:44:49,688 --> 03:44:51,610
He was pretty good, too.

2863
03:44:52,390 --> 03:44:54,451
As I listened to all of this, I had some thoughts.

2864
03:44:54,471 --> 03:45:10,882
When I hear the discussions about committee, council, this is really about the quality of the value of quality in the city, the safety of citizens, the education system.

2865
03:45:11,203 --> 03:45:14,825
Wouldn't it be nice to talk about education as opposed to the things we're talking about now?

2866
03:45:16,325 --> 03:45:21,526
having a community where families want to continue to live and attract new families.

2867
03:45:22,846 --> 03:45:24,907
That's what a lot of this is about.

2868
03:45:25,167 --> 03:45:30,387
So organizational division is not about what we need to do.

2869
03:45:30,407 --> 03:45:33,488
I had been thinking about another subject.

2870
03:45:33,528 --> 03:45:37,569
The gentleman that was just up talked about what the staff puts up with.

2871
03:45:38,429 --> 03:45:42,050
We talk about the very real student to student bullying.

2872
03:45:42,850 --> 03:45:44,570
Well, how do you think as teacher

2873
03:45:45,215 --> 03:45:54,641
an administrator, a custodian feels when they're confronted with vulgar language, disrespected when they're told when their class is disrupted.

2874
03:45:56,522 --> 03:46:03,606
The administration and school committee, I think is also allowing bullying of the staff.

2875
03:46:04,346 --> 03:46:07,308
This is just, it's just so obvious what's going on.

2876
03:46:10,830 --> 03:46:13,752
Also, I think leadership

2877
03:46:14,574 --> 03:46:15,675
is not a title.

2878
03:46:16,815 --> 03:46:18,836
It's not about an organization you're part of.

2879
03:46:19,537 --> 03:46:21,378
It's about what you bring to the table.

2880
03:46:22,078 --> 03:46:25,120
And leaders come from many different walks.

2881
03:46:25,380 --> 03:46:37,486
And I challenge anybody on any of our elected bodies to step up and demonstrate leadership, regardless of if it fits into the box that their title is.

2882
03:46:38,687 --> 03:46:43,870
And I think if you really look at, and you heard it tonight, there are many people

2883
03:46:44,578 --> 03:46:48,221
in the community that is sitting and willing to help and work with you.

2884
03:46:48,901 --> 03:46:50,102
So take advantage of that.

2885
03:46:50,383 --> 03:46:54,526
And for those that choose to lead, stand up or leave.

2886
03:46:56,948 --> 03:47:03,072
Also, one of the things I keep hearing tonight, some people don't feel comfortable talking.

2887
03:47:03,893 --> 03:47:09,658
Well, you know, I remember a book I read years ago, and it said, who will do the hard things?

2888
03:47:10,818 --> 03:47:12,720
And the answer was those that can.

2889
03:47:13,657 --> 03:47:17,239
And right there, you're looking at people that can.

2890
03:47:19,301 --> 03:47:22,343
Others who can't speak can work behind the scenes.

2891
03:47:23,003 --> 03:47:30,128
So I think there are many ways to do this, but I think people need to step up and lead.

2892
03:47:31,449 --> 03:47:33,030
And that's all I have to say.

2893
03:47:33,350 --> 03:47:33,831
Thank you.

2894
03:47:38,914 --> 03:47:40,075
Name and address for the record, please.

2895
03:47:43,806 --> 03:47:46,467
John Petrella, 61 Locust Street, Medford.

2896
03:47:49,268 --> 03:47:53,950
You know, I'm gonna start out with step up or step down.

2897
03:47:55,490 --> 03:47:57,151
I think that's the best way to start out.

2898
03:47:57,851 --> 03:48:00,092
I went to the school committee meeting last night.

2899
03:48:00,352 --> 03:48:01,992
I've been to other school committee meetings.

2900
03:48:04,253 --> 03:48:09,435
And you know, you go there and I listen and my stomach turns.

2901
03:48:10,776 --> 03:48:11,896
I get up, I speak.

2902
03:48:12,868 --> 03:48:21,591
my stomach turns and then, I mean, this is really serious stuff, okay?

2903
03:48:22,171 --> 03:48:23,632
Heartfelt stuff.

2904
03:48:24,872 --> 03:48:39,477
And I left the school committee meeting and I got home and my stomach turns more because it's like, it's just,

2905
03:48:40,545 --> 03:48:43,727
Nothing got accomplished at that meeting last night.

2906
03:48:44,747 --> 03:49:01,375
It's like you're just... You know, people went, they spoke from their hearts, they spoke what they felt, and you walk out of there and it's like, they didn't listen to us, they ignored us, they argue with you.

2907
03:49:02,456 --> 03:49:03,736
It's just, it's not right.

2908
03:49:04,337 --> 03:49:06,338
That's all, it's not right.

2909
03:49:06,358 --> 03:49:08,499
I mean, we're dealing with serious stuff.

2910
03:49:10,182 --> 03:49:15,204
You know, I came here tonight, you know, the same thing.

2911
03:49:15,544 --> 03:49:18,305
I'm hoping something's going to get accomplished tonight.

2912
03:49:20,246 --> 03:49:23,187
That's just two stories of many.

2913
03:49:23,508 --> 03:49:23,888
Okay.

2914
03:49:24,468 --> 03:49:31,551
And you know, I want to go back and just say, all right, my politics should have nothing to do with anything.

2915
03:49:31,911 --> 03:49:32,311
Okay.

2916
03:49:32,771 --> 03:49:33,712
They really shouldn't.

2917
03:49:34,072 --> 03:49:34,392
Okay.

2918
03:49:35,072 --> 03:49:35,272
All right.

2919
03:49:35,312 --> 03:49:36,833
Let me establish that first.

2920
03:49:38,630 --> 03:49:41,631
Everyone knows what my politics are, okay?

2921
03:49:42,632 --> 03:49:48,475
I disagree with her, I disagree with Zach, I disagree with this revolution stuff.

2922
03:49:49,455 --> 03:49:50,556
I do, okay?

2923
03:49:51,376 --> 03:49:56,719
But the school committee got elected, okay?

2924
03:49:57,579 --> 03:49:59,880
And you people are elected, okay?

2925
03:50:00,641 --> 03:50:00,761
And

2926
03:50:02,649 --> 03:50:04,770
I don't want to see anyone feel.

2927
03:50:05,450 --> 03:50:08,550
No one in this city wants to see anyone feel.

2928
03:50:08,610 --> 03:50:13,952
I've lived here my whole life and I've been privileged to live here my whole life.

2929
03:50:14,072 --> 03:50:14,832
I really have.

2930
03:50:15,652 --> 03:50:16,432
It's been great.

2931
03:50:16,972 --> 03:50:23,074
And I, you know, I hear people talking about 20 years, you know, back in the high school and on and on and on.

2932
03:50:23,154 --> 03:50:23,594
Okay.

2933
03:50:24,634 --> 03:50:25,755
Times have changed.

2934
03:50:25,815 --> 03:50:26,655
Things are different.

2935
03:50:26,795 --> 03:50:27,955
I understand all that.

2936
03:50:28,035 --> 03:50:28,475
Okay.

2937
03:50:29,215 --> 03:50:29,375
But

2938
03:50:32,238 --> 03:50:40,366
The revolution, let's call it what it is, the revolution, the agenda, the agenda, I call it the agenda, okay?

2939
03:50:40,826 --> 03:50:47,112
I was more than willing to see what happens, and I wanna see everyone succeed.

2940
03:50:48,053 --> 03:50:50,115
I love successful people, okay?

2941
03:50:50,616 --> 03:50:54,539
I don't want no one to feel, but I'm telling you, you are,

2942
03:50:55,400 --> 03:51:00,445
This agenda, agenda, agenda, agenda, okay?

2943
03:51:00,705 --> 03:51:02,346
No discipline in the high school.

2944
03:51:02,386 --> 03:51:03,407
I can go on and on.

2945
03:51:03,427 --> 03:51:05,209
I can go on for hours, okay?

2946
03:51:05,849 --> 03:51:07,591
Override two and a half.

2947
03:51:07,951 --> 03:51:09,913
Half the city is broke.

2948
03:51:10,493 --> 03:51:11,995
You know, we're pushing money.

2949
03:51:12,075 --> 03:51:13,596
I hear more money, more money.

2950
03:51:14,137 --> 03:51:16,219
Where is our money going now?

2951
03:51:16,679 --> 03:51:18,621
Where are our tax dollars going?

2952
03:51:19,181 --> 03:51:20,803
No one can answer the question.

2953
03:51:22,622 --> 03:51:28,011
So so I'm going to get back to the school situation because I can go all over the place here.

2954
03:51:28,031 --> 03:51:30,275
I don't want to but

2955
03:51:31,928 --> 03:51:33,769
We're failing, okay?

2956
03:51:33,829 --> 03:51:37,612
This agenda is failing the city, okay?

2957
03:51:38,153 --> 03:51:40,294
I listened to George, okay?

2958
03:51:40,334 --> 03:51:43,496
I listened to Rick tonight, and I listened to Adam.

2959
03:51:43,897 --> 03:51:51,122
And I hear common sense, things that I can compute in my mind, and this is what we need to do.

2960
03:51:52,063 --> 03:51:54,144
And then I hear other stuff.

2961
03:51:54,444 --> 03:51:55,565
Let's support George.

2962
03:51:55,625 --> 03:51:57,547
I think George got some great ideas.

2963
03:51:58,227 --> 03:52:00,369
Why are we not supporting him?

2964
03:52:01,838 --> 03:52:03,359
We're hearing his resolution right now.

2965
03:52:06,361 --> 03:52:09,182
There's a number of resolutions on the agenda we haven't gotten to yet.

2966
03:52:09,463 --> 03:52:10,563
Oh, we haven't got to it.

2967
03:52:10,583 --> 03:52:15,006
So wasn't there something on the agenda two weeks ago that we didn't pass?

2968
03:52:15,386 --> 03:52:18,668
It feels I believe four to three that had to do with the school.

2969
03:52:19,528 --> 03:52:31,814
no it passed it passed okay but it passed but it passed with changes or something right yeah okay you're welcome to watch the tape back okay also passed a resolution four to three to send funding for

2970
03:52:32,587 --> 03:52:34,688
safety, social, emotional health and support.

2971
03:52:34,748 --> 03:52:36,149
Yeah, no, I understand all that.

2972
03:52:36,189 --> 03:52:38,650
And that's, that's, I don't, I don't want to get into that, Zach.

2973
03:52:38,710 --> 03:52:42,012
Of course, because that's addressing all this other stuff.

2974
03:52:42,612 --> 03:52:47,434
The social emotional is, is in my opinion, that's another big part of the problem.

2975
03:52:47,895 --> 03:52:48,675
Discipline.

2976
03:52:48,915 --> 03:52:50,576
That's what we should be talking about.

2977
03:52:51,116 --> 03:52:55,098
That's what needs to be done, but we don't want to discipline anyone anymore.

2978
03:52:55,498 --> 03:52:57,179
It's a bad thing.

2979
03:52:58,160 --> 03:52:58,880
Bad thing.

2980
03:53:00,182 --> 03:53:01,703
We're failing, that's all.

2981
03:53:02,684 --> 03:53:04,345
That's the bottom line, okay?

2982
03:53:04,425 --> 03:53:05,585
It's not working.

2983
03:53:05,965 --> 03:53:12,309
If your agenda or the agenda that we all want was working, I'd be up here, thank God, okay, fine.

2984
03:53:13,410 --> 03:53:14,811
It's not working.

2985
03:53:15,231 --> 03:53:17,392
It's not working for the city of Medford.

2986
03:53:17,612 --> 03:53:18,353
And that's it.

2987
03:53:18,733 --> 03:53:19,634
That's all I have to say.

2988
03:53:20,094 --> 03:53:21,555
Step up or step down.

2989
03:53:27,817 --> 03:53:29,058
Name and address for the record, please.

2990
03:53:29,078 --> 03:53:30,539
Bill Giglio, Winthrop Street.

2991
03:53:31,759 --> 03:53:33,820
So my two boys are out of school now.

2992
03:53:33,920 --> 03:53:41,645
And yesterday, my phone, when it was blowing up, all that I got was text messages saying, aren't you glad our kids are out of here?

2993
03:53:41,745 --> 03:53:44,126
And unfortunately, for me, that's not the truth.

2994
03:53:44,186 --> 03:53:46,347
I still have a seven-year-old, second grade.

2995
03:53:46,508 --> 03:53:48,949
In seven short years, she's going to be up at that high school.

2996
03:53:50,310 --> 03:53:51,310
A little girl who Ms.

2997
03:53:51,771 --> 03:53:54,332
Braley here was very instrumental in, in her beginning years.

2998
03:53:54,803 --> 03:54:14,793
When we talk about leadership, we talk about elected officials, we should talk about, you know, some of the things, you know, when an elected official goes on a Zoom meeting and says a pocket knife is really not a suspendable offense, and look what happened yesterday, somebody got stabbed.

2999
03:54:15,194 --> 03:54:17,675
When that same elected official posts pictures

3000
03:54:20,284 --> 03:54:23,569
keep it keep it keep it to the schools and we're not going to go through.

3001
03:54:23,789 --> 03:54:26,953
Okay, electric and electric.

3002
03:54:27,073 --> 03:54:28,656
I know what you're going to do.

3003
03:54:28,696 --> 03:54:28,936
Please.

3004
03:54:28,956 --> 03:54:30,258
You want to show it around?

3005
03:54:30,278 --> 03:54:30,919
Please keep it.

3006
03:54:36,957 --> 03:54:43,259
Mr. Giglio, Mr. Giglio, please speak into the mic, focus on the schools or I'll ask you to stop.

3007
03:54:43,299 --> 03:54:44,980
You can ask me to leave.

3008
03:54:45,000 --> 03:54:47,200
Please come back to the schools.

3009
03:54:47,701 --> 03:54:50,061
You want to come back to the issue at hand, come back to the issue at hand.

3010
03:54:50,081 --> 03:54:51,662
We're not going through everyone's social media.

3011
03:54:51,682 --> 03:54:56,263
Leadership stops at the top, okay, and it doesn't go with messages like this.

3012
03:54:56,283 --> 03:54:58,864
Again, focus on the schools.

3013
03:54:58,964 --> 03:55:00,965
We're not going through everyone's social media tonight.

3014
03:55:01,485 --> 03:55:01,745
Okay.

3015
03:55:02,705 --> 03:55:03,266
Bring it back.

3016
03:55:04,986 --> 03:55:14,092
when that elected official on a school Zoom meeting says that bringing a pocket knife is not a suspendable offense.

3017
03:55:15,993 --> 03:55:16,854
Look what happened yesterday.

3018
03:55:17,354 --> 03:55:20,736
Is now a pocket knife a suspendable offense?

3019
03:55:23,018 --> 03:55:24,518
Completely out of context statement.

3020
03:55:24,919 --> 03:55:25,219
What's that?

3021
03:55:26,400 --> 03:55:27,120
I didn't hear that, I'm sorry.

3022
03:55:29,342 --> 03:55:29,722
Yes, it is.

3023
03:55:30,535 --> 03:55:34,578
I just said you're completely out of context for your political ends.

3024
03:55:35,158 --> 03:55:35,899
Oh, okay.

3025
03:55:36,219 --> 03:55:44,865
It's incredibly easy for people to take their own politics and map them onto any situation they want and then use it to justify or blame people for results.

3026
03:55:45,345 --> 03:55:45,505
Right.

3027
03:55:45,525 --> 03:55:56,353
But when people, when kids hear that taking a pocket knife to school is not a suspendable offense, what do you think might happen when people say that out of context and repeat it and repeat it over again?

3028
03:55:57,068 --> 03:55:58,029
to rile people up.

3029
03:55:58,049 --> 03:56:02,552
What's out of context?

3030
03:56:02,592 --> 03:56:03,372
What's out of context?

3031
03:56:03,432 --> 03:56:08,576
Watch the video you can see for yourself.

3032
03:56:11,858 --> 03:56:13,139
Most likely you won't watch it though.

3033
03:56:14,200 --> 03:56:20,143
And you won't respond like it was so that that's all I want to say leadership stats at the top and it doesn't start with thank you stuff like this.

3034
03:56:20,163 --> 03:56:21,184
Thank you for everyone.

3035
03:56:21,204 --> 03:56:22,325
Thank you for listening to me.

3036
03:56:29,175 --> 03:56:30,896
Name and address for the record, please.

3037
03:56:30,916 --> 03:56:31,976
State Mayor, 373 Riverside Ave.

3038
03:56:32,876 --> 03:56:35,377
Thank you, Councilor, and I'll keep it quick because I have a little one at home.

3039
03:56:36,577 --> 03:56:40,338
I'm here as a parent, but my child is not even in school yet.

3040
03:56:41,159 --> 03:56:44,520
I'm here because I'm looking at, do I want my child to go to Medford Public Schools?

3041
03:56:45,320 --> 03:56:46,780
My wife asked me a question last night.

3042
03:56:47,500 --> 03:56:50,541
She says, because she read and saw everything on the news.

3043
03:56:50,641 --> 03:56:55,003
So in fact, Councilor Scarpelli, I may ask you a couple of things to get through the chaff.

3044
03:56:57,289 --> 03:56:59,410
What we saw in the news was it was three hours.

3045
03:56:59,830 --> 03:57:00,770
People were in lockdown.

3046
03:57:00,790 --> 03:57:03,171
There was no official communication on what happened.

3047
03:57:03,831 --> 03:57:09,212
And the only way that students could communicate to their parents was with this.

3048
03:57:10,653 --> 03:57:12,393
Is that pretty accurate, sir?

3049
03:57:12,413 --> 03:57:15,294
Okay.

3050
03:57:15,434 --> 03:57:16,114
I hate these.

3051
03:57:18,675 --> 03:57:24,757
What really bothered me, and when I saw Councilor Carviela this morning, first question came to my mind.

3052
03:57:26,621 --> 03:57:28,182
why were people doing this?

3053
03:57:29,103 --> 03:57:41,710
And I will respectfully disagree with you in the terms of what happened 30 years ago and so on and so forth when I was in high school and longer when you were, because I think there are things we can learn from that, especially in policy.

3054
03:57:42,471 --> 03:57:48,214
Yes, situations change, environments change, technology changes, and policies change.

3055
03:57:49,235 --> 03:57:54,878
But it doesn't mean that maybe all the changes that we have made are good, and maybe we can learn from history

3056
03:57:56,206 --> 03:57:57,787
and try to tweak things for the better.

3057
03:57:58,388 --> 03:58:00,970
So I think we should respect their history and not ignore that.

3058
03:58:01,490 --> 03:58:03,412
Councilor Scarpelli.

3059
03:58:03,432 --> 03:58:07,075
I'm sorry, maybe you didn't understand what I meant.

3060
03:58:07,175 --> 03:58:11,399
It was the fact that I wanted to bring it back to today.

3061
03:58:11,959 --> 03:58:13,200
We need to focus on today.

3062
03:58:13,780 --> 03:58:20,186
We can't go back to 30 years right now and worry about this today because today is the crisis.

3063
03:58:20,806 --> 03:58:22,027
That's my intent.

3064
03:58:22,127 --> 03:58:22,688
Absolutely, I'm sorry.

3065
03:58:22,708 --> 03:58:24,049
I didn't mean to sound accused or that,

3066
03:58:24,428 --> 03:58:33,431
but just we should keep in mind that, you know, things that were policies when I was in high school or when you were in high school, maybe you're not necessarily bad things to revisit or consider.

3067
03:58:34,611 --> 03:58:41,654
So I think as a policy action, right, something that doesn't take a lot of money, we could figure out within a week, right?

3068
03:58:41,694 --> 03:58:46,155
People do hot washes in jobs, in corporate, in the fire service,

3069
03:58:46,524 --> 03:58:49,827
In the military, you do an operation right afterwards, you do a debrief.

3070
03:58:50,227 --> 03:58:50,928
What happened?

3071
03:58:51,328 --> 03:58:52,189
How do we do it better?

3072
03:58:52,209 --> 03:58:55,172
In the medical community, they'll do what they call M&M rounds, right?

3073
03:58:55,272 --> 03:58:59,456
Unfortunately, if a patient passes away, they wanna figure out how do we get better?

3074
03:59:00,437 --> 03:59:07,203
I think that's something that we should be asking the schools to get within the next week or two.

3075
03:59:07,703 --> 03:59:11,547
Why did it take hours for the school

3076
03:59:12,093 --> 03:59:13,554
to communicate to parents.

3077
03:59:14,194 --> 03:59:18,637
I personally don't understand the purpose of a lockdown given this incident and why it was ours.

3078
03:59:18,937 --> 03:59:25,120
There's difference between preserving a crime scene versus locking everyone in because you think it's an active shooter.

3079
03:59:26,181 --> 03:59:27,141
I don't wanna debate that.

3080
03:59:27,201 --> 03:59:29,602
I have no idea what that is and there may be a rationale.

3081
03:59:30,023 --> 03:59:38,847
That rationale should be communicated to the parents, but also within a week or not even, why did it take so long?

3082
03:59:38,947 --> 03:59:41,829
Because I'd love to see all these gotten rid of from schools.

3083
03:59:42,715 --> 03:59:50,959
But at the same time, if a parent can't know that their students are safe or their children are safe, then what other mechanism do you have?

3084
03:59:50,999 --> 03:59:51,839
So it's kind of a catch 22.

3085
03:59:53,240 --> 03:59:56,281
So I think we really can do better and this doesn't cost a nickel.

3086
03:59:57,502 --> 04:00:08,046
So last quote that I will leave you all with, we must all fear evil men, but there's another kind of evil which we must fear most.

3087
04:00:08,546 --> 04:00:10,087
And that is the indifference of good men.

3088
04:00:12,441 --> 04:00:17,303
It's a quote, I'm sorry, but that said, I think it rings true, right?

3089
04:00:17,404 --> 04:00:21,005
Especially in situations, we can take action, right?

3090
04:00:21,165 --> 04:00:27,589
I think these are things that could be taken, you know, done now, because otherwise, when my wife asked me, do we send our kid to public schools?

3091
04:00:28,009 --> 04:00:28,629
My answer is no.

3092
04:00:29,370 --> 04:00:32,591
I will work more and send my kid to private school.

3093
04:00:33,612 --> 04:00:33,892
Thank you.

3094
04:00:34,292 --> 04:00:34,632
Thank you.

3095
04:00:36,153 --> 04:00:37,814
Any other members of the public haven't spoken yet?

3096
04:00:38,394 --> 04:00:41,896
Either on Zoom or in person.

3097
04:00:45,136 --> 04:00:47,598
Seeing none, do I have a motion on the floor?

3098
04:00:49,879 --> 04:00:51,781
Motion to read papers 22-614-2261.

3099
04:00:51,821 --> 04:00:55,623
We have to dispose, sorry, we just have to dispose of this paper.

3100
04:00:55,684 --> 04:00:56,604
It's part of the motion.

3101
04:00:56,804 --> 04:00:57,125
Okay.

3102
04:00:57,225 --> 04:01:01,107
Motion to read 22-614-615-616-617 and 618.

3103
04:01:02,248 --> 04:01:04,930
Merge them all together and a motion to approve.

3104
04:01:05,410 --> 04:01:09,073
Great idea, second that.

3105
04:01:09,313 --> 04:01:12,375
Okay, so can you do like a through like 614 through the clerk

3106
04:01:14,339 --> 04:01:15,119
614 through 618.

3107
04:01:15,819 --> 04:01:21,260
So the motion is to read them, merge them, approve them.

3108
04:01:22,281 --> 04:01:22,521
614 through 618.

3109
04:01:22,641 --> 04:01:27,222
I'm going to read them in succession.

3110
04:01:27,542 --> 04:01:28,942
Well, actually we're gonna vote on it first.

3111
04:01:31,282 --> 04:01:33,323
Did you catch that motion Councilor Knight?

3112
04:01:34,783 --> 04:01:36,363
Okay, love that for you.

3113
04:01:39,224 --> 04:01:39,624
We all do.

3114
04:01:40,820 --> 04:01:41,560
I'm sorry to see.

3115
04:01:41,620 --> 04:01:47,683
Okay, before we move on, I do see one hand up from Mr. Curry, Sean Curry name and address for the record, please.

3116
04:01:53,086 --> 04:02:09,094
You should get a notification to unmute Mr. Curry, if your hand was raised in error, or you've stepped away, we will

3117
04:02:10,067 --> 04:02:10,727
come back to you.

3118
04:02:10,747 --> 04:02:11,607
Okay.

3119
04:02:12,688 --> 04:02:22,590
So the motion on the floor is to read and merge 22-614, 22-615, 22-616, 22-617 and 22-618 and move approval.

3120
04:02:25,951 --> 04:02:28,631

04:08:41,672 --> 04:08:44,933
On the motion of Vice President Behr, seconded by Councilor Knight.

3221
04:08:44,973 --> 04:08:46,093

3229

The motion of Vice President Behrs to table 22-602 until the next meeting.

3232
04:09:30,189 --> 04:09:34,591
Actually, sorry, if I may, is there Mo Lewis on Zoom?

3233
04:09:35,291 --> 04:09:35,711
Let's see.

3234
04:09:41,533 --> 04:09:44,395
I do not see a Mo Lewis.

3235
04:09:44,795 --> 04:09:46,496
Mo Lewis, if you are here, please raise your hand.

3236
04:09:46,516 --> 04:09:49,097
I'm not seeing, like when I type into the participants, I'm not seeing it.

3237
04:09:49,117 --> 04:09:51,598
I don't want to cut you.

3238
04:09:51,658 --> 04:09:53,819
If you've been here all night, Mo, I don't want to cut you out.

3239
04:09:59,221 --> 04:10:01,562
Sean Curry, you are not Mo Lewis, correct?

3240
04:10:01,582 --> 04:10:02,722
Sean Curry's hand is still up.

3241
04:10:02,742 --> 04:10:06,124
So I just want to make sure Sean Curry is not Mo Lewis.

3242
04:10:06,224 --> 04:10:07,264
I will table the next meeting.

3243
04:10:07,284 --> 04:10:07,985
I'll follow up with him.

3244
04:10:09,509 --> 04:10:13,192
I wish to embarrass the table to do just 602 until the next meeting.

3245
04:10:13,792 --> 04:10:16,174
Second by Mr. Carvalho.

3246
04:10:16,194 --> 04:10:21,519
Mr. Clark, please call the roll.

3247
04:10:21,579 --> 04:10:21,779
Yes.

3248
04:10:22,540 --> 04:10:23,921
Yes.

3249
04:10:24,021 --> 04:10:25,062
Yes.

3250
04:10:25,842 --> 04:10:26,082
Yes.

3251
04:10:27,744 --> 04:10:27,944
Yes.

3252
04:10:28,004 --> 04:10:32,968
I mean, the firm is there and then I get motion passes to do that 605 over by Councilor Collins and President Morrell.

3253
04:10:33,583 --> 04:10:51,252
Whereas all residents and businesses in Medford should have convenient and equitable access to recycling collection services to ensure that private haulers are operating in compliance with state regulations, including the Massachusetts Waste Ban, and to ensure that municipal contractors and private haulers are working together to support the goals of the Solid Waste Master Plan and Global Warming Solutions Act.

3254
04:10:51,272 --> 04:10:59,476
It is so resolved that the Subcommittee on Rules and Ordinances meet to discuss an ordinance to regulate and create permitting standards for private waste haulers operating in Medford.

3255
04:10:59,536 --> 04:11:02,137
Be it further resolved that the Office of Planning, Development, and Sustainability

3256
04:11:02,713 --> 04:11:10,458
consult with the subcommittee on draft ordinance language and strategies for integrating such an ordinance with the city's existing ordinances and permitting procedures for waste removal.

3257
04:11:10,899 --> 04:11:11,459
Councilor Collins.

3258
04:11:11,960 --> 04:11:12,960
Thank you, President Merrill.

3259
04:11:13,000 --> 04:11:14,381
Just to keep it very brief.

3260
04:11:14,401 --> 04:11:17,944
This is a project that I've already discussed with the director of PBS.

3261
04:11:17,984 --> 04:11:20,926
This came about because of my involvement in the solid waste task force.

3262
04:11:20,946 --> 04:11:26,670
They thought that an ordinance to this effect would help further the overall goals of the task force and further streamline

3263
04:11:28,121 --> 04:11:31,143
standards and operations for all waste haulers in Medford.

3264
04:11:31,163 --> 04:11:34,605
They've already indicated that draft language is available.

3265
04:11:34,725 --> 04:11:38,128
So I'd move approval for referring this into subcommittee for further study.

3266
04:11:38,508 --> 04:11:48,275
Thank you, Councilor Collins and Director of Health Marion O'Connor also reached out to us to say that there has been a health department policy since 2009 that we could

3267
04:11:49,369 --> 04:11:52,650
could definitely be a starting place for this that may use could use some updates.

3268
04:11:53,250 --> 04:11:57,491
So on the motion of Councilor Collins is seconded by Councilor Carvalho.

3269
04:11:57,551 --> 04:11:58,491
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

3270
04:11:58,511 --> 04:11:58,631
Yes.

3271
04:11:58,651 --> 04:12:07,374
Yes.

3272
04:12:07,414 --> 04:12:07,634
Yes.

3273
04:12:07,694 --> 04:12:07,954
Yes.

3274
04:12:08,014 --> 04:12:08,434
Yes.

3275
04:12:08,634 --> 04:12:14,316
Seven affirmative, zero negative motion passes.

3276
04:12:20,578 --> 04:12:22,179
22-606 offered by Councilor Carvalho.

3277
04:12:22,259 --> 04:12:30,885
Be it so resolved that the Medford City Council have to DCR immediately repair the 17 streetlights on South Quarter Road between Medford and Winchester in the interest of public safety.

3278
04:12:31,165 --> 04:12:31,966
Councilor Carvalho.

3279
04:12:32,006 --> 04:12:32,946
Thank you, Madam President.

3280
04:12:33,467 --> 04:12:34,547
Pretty simple resolution.

3281
04:12:35,668 --> 04:12:48,017
Anyone who drives down South Quarter Road right now, especially in the winter where it gets dark at five o'clock, very dangerous road, 17 sets of lights out on that stretch between, especially there's, I think,

3282
04:12:48,702 --> 04:12:52,084
five or six lights are right at the beginning of South Florida road, where all the homes are.

3283
04:12:52,744 --> 04:12:57,467
Like I said, it's very dangerous on that road, especially in the dark, animals are running out of the woods.

3284
04:12:57,487 --> 04:13:07,153
So I've contacted DCI myself and they say they know about it, but obviously this has been going on for the last six, seven months.

3285
04:13:07,173 --> 04:13:13,957
So if we can get out, maybe get our state delegation involved with this also.

3286
04:13:14,918 --> 04:13:15,759
Thank you, Councilor Carvalho.

3287
04:13:16,854 --> 04:13:19,616
On the motion, Councilor Carviello, seconded by Councilor Knight.

3288
04:13:19,696 --> 04:13:20,817
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

3289
04:13:22,358 --> 04:13:22,699
Yes.

3290
04:13:23,399 --> 04:13:23,860
Yes.

3291
04:13:23,900 --> 04:13:24,140
Yes.

3292
04:13:24,680 --> 04:13:24,940
Yes.

3293
04:13:25,000 --> 04:13:25,301
Yes.

3294
04:13:25,361 --> 04:13:25,581
Yes.

3295
04:13:26,101 --> 04:13:30,745
And the negative motion passes.

3296
04:13:30,765 --> 04:13:32,106
22-607.

3297
04:13:32,186 --> 04:13:33,287
Offer by Vice Chair Behrs.

3298
04:13:38,132 --> 04:13:45,653
Whereas a significant number of city council requests to the mayor and city administration for information, updates and action have gone unanswered or unfulfilled.

3299
04:13:45,813 --> 04:13:53,115
Now, therefore, sorry, be it resolved by the members of the council that council rule 12 order of business be updated to strike the following language.

3300
04:13:53,935 --> 04:13:56,995
Nine, unfinished business of preceding meetings and replaced with language.

3301
04:13:57,095 --> 04:13:58,236
Nine, unfinished business.

3302
04:13:58,556 --> 04:13:59,436
A, tabled items.

3303
04:13:59,536 --> 04:14:00,436
B, reports due.

3304
04:14:00,536 --> 04:14:01,376
C, over requests.

3305
04:14:01,516 --> 04:14:05,397
And we do have a number of proposed amendments to this, correct from Councilor Knight?

3306
04:14:06,562 --> 04:14:11,846
Madam President, I would move to refer the original paper and the amendments to the Subcommittee on Rules and Ordinances.

3307
04:14:13,006 --> 04:14:15,628
Okay, great.

3308
04:14:15,708 --> 04:14:19,390
The motion of, they're all out there in our inboxes as well on our desk.

3309
04:14:19,430 --> 04:14:23,493
So on the motion of Vice President Behrs to move this paper to the Subcommittee on Rules and Ordinances.

3310
04:14:24,674 --> 04:14:25,314
And the amendments.

3311
04:14:25,414 --> 04:14:28,096
And the amendments from Councilor Knight.

3312
04:14:28,176 --> 04:14:30,237
So as amended, and the amendments from Councilor Knight.

3313
04:14:31,578 --> 04:14:34,240
Seconded by Councilor Knight.

3314
04:14:34,540 --> 04:14:35,521
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

3315
04:14:45,207 --> 04:14:46,528
Yes.

3316
04:14:46,628 --> 04:14:46,828
Yes.

3317
04:14:51,930 --> 04:14:52,170
Yes.

3318
04:14:53,990 --> 04:14:54,431
Yes, sir.

3319
04:14:54,451 --> 04:14:56,231
The affirmative zero negative motion passes.

3320
04:14:57,492 --> 04:14:57,732
All right.

3321
04:14:58,592 --> 04:14:58,852
All right.

3322
04:14:58,872 --> 04:15:09,497
To do that 608 offered by Councilor Carvalho be it so resolved that the Metro City Council have the administration and police chief, contact the DCR to install no overnight parking signs on the route 16 bypass road.

3323
04:15:09,557 --> 04:15:12,738
Please send this request to our state delegation also Councilor Carvalho.

3324
04:15:13,101 --> 04:15:14,182
Thank you madam President.

3325
04:15:14,482 --> 04:15:23,407
For anyone who travels that Route 16 bypass road, which goes by the DPW yard, City of Memphis turning into overnight truck parking spot.

3326
04:15:24,588 --> 04:15:30,412
You go by there on any given night, there's car trailers, trailer trucks just left there.

3327
04:15:31,232 --> 04:15:34,815
There's campers parked on the side of the road over there.

3328
04:15:35,215 --> 04:15:35,395
Again,

3329
04:15:36,675 --> 04:15:39,597
Well, the city, our curb appeal is horrible.

3330
04:15:40,357 --> 04:15:48,463
I won't even get into commercial street, which is another overnight truck spot for people from trucks from Everett to park there for free, because they don't have anything to park there.

3331
04:15:48,483 --> 04:15:52,865
So again, that's a major thoroughfare where people go by and see all the time.

3332
04:15:53,406 --> 04:15:55,607
I'm tired of going by and seeing overnight trucks parked there.

3333
04:15:55,867 --> 04:15:57,228
There's two campus parked there.

3334
04:15:57,969 --> 04:16:03,172
And again, the city's becoming a truck stop and a parking lot for everybody.

3335
04:16:04,773 --> 04:16:13,221
Correct me if I'm wrong, this is route 16 eastbound between Main Street and Harvard.

3336
04:16:13,481 --> 04:16:18,706
If we could just amend it to reflect route 16 eastbound between Main Street and the intersection with Harvard.

3337
04:16:18,726 --> 04:16:19,967
I don't know if it has an official name.

3338
04:16:19,987 --> 04:16:20,407
Harvard Street.

3339
04:16:21,128 --> 04:16:22,009
It is route 16.

3340
04:16:22,089 --> 04:16:22,389
Yeah.

3341
04:16:22,489 --> 04:16:29,075
On the motion of Councilor Carvalho as amended by Vice President Bex, seconded by

3342
04:16:30,530 --> 04:16:32,271
Councilor Knight nodding at me.

3343
04:16:33,291 --> 04:16:34,572
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

3344
04:16:38,874 --> 04:16:39,194
Yes.

3345
04:16:42,555 --> 04:16:42,776
Yes.

3346
04:16:43,536 --> 04:16:46,277
Yes.

3347
04:16:46,697 --> 04:16:46,957
Yes.

3348
04:16:48,838 --> 04:16:49,038
Yes.

3349
04:16:49,219 --> 04:16:50,959
Senator Farmer is here and I give motion passes.

3350
04:16:50,999 --> 04:16:52,880
Madam President, motion to table papers 22610, 22611 and 22612.

3351
04:16:57,805 --> 04:17:02,447
On the motion of Vice President Barris to table paper 2-611, sorry, 2-610, 2-611, and 2-612 until the next regular meeting.

3352
04:17:02,467 --> 04:17:07,089
Madam President, on 2-612, ultimately what I'm seeing is that the mayor is using our agenda to promote

3353
04:17:19,802 --> 04:17:22,324
nothing more than what she's spending her Apple money on.

3354
04:17:22,544 --> 04:17:24,926
We don't have any say whatsoever.

3355
04:17:25,587 --> 04:17:29,070
So I don't understand why we need to entertain these presentations.

3356
04:17:29,170 --> 04:17:30,752
I mean, all it is is a dog and pony show.

3357
04:17:30,792 --> 04:17:32,453
I really think it's nothing more than campaigning.

3358
04:17:33,074 --> 04:17:33,894
It's really campaigning.

3359
04:17:33,934 --> 04:17:35,516
It has nothing to do with what's going on in the city.

3360
04:17:35,776 --> 04:17:37,357
There's nothing to do with what's going on with his body.

3361
04:17:37,497 --> 04:17:38,118
It's campaigning.

3362
04:17:38,819 --> 04:17:40,080
So I don't think that that should be allowed.

3363
04:17:40,120 --> 04:17:45,905
I think that if the mayor is going to offer a paper that the paper should be related to issues that require council action by law.

3364
04:17:47,372 --> 04:17:47,913
Thank you, President.

3365
04:17:47,953 --> 04:18:00,605
I just want, on the responses we just got back on the previous ARPA presentation, so on this paper, she did write, no formal vote needed, but we do plan to update you all on large-scale projects, gain your feedback, and answer your questions.

3366
04:18:00,645 --> 04:18:05,569
We also want to make sure there's no objections, so we will be rethinking that position of the spending.

3367
04:18:05,589 --> 04:18:06,390
So I'm just repeating.

3368
04:18:06,430 --> 04:18:07,331
I'm just repeating what I said.

3369
04:18:09,934 --> 04:18:16,559
We don't want to do anything without doing anything because we want you guys to make sure that if we do it, you're not going to say anything bad if we make a mistake, right?

3370
04:18:16,619 --> 04:18:21,963
I mean, ultimately they want verification and validation of the decisions that they make it, but we don't have to take a vote on it.

3371
04:18:21,983 --> 04:18:24,965
I mean, come on, be a leader, make decisions.

3372
04:18:24,985 --> 04:18:26,967
It's like government by committee doesn't work.

3373
04:18:27,067 --> 04:18:33,872
I mean, is that, are we considering that an official communication that our vote is not required?

3374
04:18:34,453 --> 04:18:36,514
because we did ask a question as to whether our voters.

3375
04:18:36,654 --> 04:18:39,156
And that's basically what the chief of staff said kind of the same.

3376
04:18:40,677 --> 04:18:41,498
Yeah, super direct.

3377
04:18:41,638 --> 04:18:43,579
So I'm not really an answer.

3378
04:18:44,099 --> 04:18:45,660
Okay.

3379
04:18:45,680 --> 04:18:52,065
So on the motion of ice and embarrassed to table 22610 to do that 611 and to do that 612.

3380
04:18:52,525 --> 04:18:54,466
Second by Councillor Knight, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

3381
04:19:02,903 --> 04:19:04,704
Yes.

3382
04:19:05,424 --> 04:19:05,705
Yes.

3383
04:19:08,346 --> 04:19:08,786
Yes, sir.

3384
04:19:08,806 --> 04:19:11,408
And then I have the motion passes.

3385
04:19:11,788 --> 04:19:18,832
We have one previous petition petition from public participation that's on the agenda, but she has left and we'll refile in January.

3386
04:19:21,834 --> 04:19:25,136
Is there anyone else who would like to speak for public participation?

3387
04:19:25,156 --> 04:19:27,977
Any topic under the council's purview?

3388
04:19:32,817 --> 04:19:33,858
I'm gonna try one last time.

3389
04:19:33,918 --> 04:19:34,938
Sean Curry, are you there?

3390
04:19:34,958 --> 04:19:38,260
His hand's still up.

3391
04:19:38,901 --> 04:19:43,364
Okay, see, I know some people may accidentally raise their hand.

3392
04:19:43,464 --> 04:19:50,748
Okay, seeing none, on the motion of Councilor Collins to adjourn, seconded by Councilor Carvillo.

3393
04:19:50,788 --> 04:19:51,949
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

3394
04:19:51,989 --> 04:19:52,089
Yes.

3395
04:20:02,505 --> 04:20:05,268
wish everybody a safe Christmas and a new year.

3396
04:20:05,348 --> 04:20:05,548
Thank you.

3397
04:20:05,568 --> 04:20:07,730
We already did Hanukkah.

3398
04:20:07,790 --> 04:20:07,910
Okay.

3399
04:20:08,190 --> 04:20:10,973
I'm a yes on the adjourn.

3400
04:20:11,193 --> 04:20:13,155
The meeting is adjourned.
