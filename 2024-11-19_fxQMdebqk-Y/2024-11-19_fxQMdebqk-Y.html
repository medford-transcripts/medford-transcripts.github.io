    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=114.987s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=116.808s">Um,</a>  it's my privilege tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=118.428s">I</a>  know we've had, um, we've had a tough week here in Medford, and, um, this is fitting and needed, uh, to address a group of young people that have done our city proud. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=134.774s">Um,</a>  and before I recognize anyone, if Coach Curley and coach offered, come on up. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=156.857s">I</a>  just called them up just because next to coach Curly, I looked like a supermodel. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=162.261s">So</a>  I wanted to make sure he was next to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=165.964s">But</a>  you guys, I wanted to really put a resolution through a few weeks back to acknowledge what the Method Mustang football team has done and their coaching staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=180.575s">Something</a>  that's always overlooked <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=184.382s">is</a>  the impact that young people play in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=188.263s">And</a>  it's easy when it's something bad, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=190.324s">When</a>  it's something bad, everybody wants to talk about what the kids are doing wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=195.085s">But</a>  I wanted to make sure that as I look through different messages that I received, I was noticing a trend. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=206.528s">I</a>  was noticing an amazing trend. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=211.09s">that</a>  our football team is a special, special group of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=216.813s">I</a>  coached at Medford High School for many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=219.795s">I</a>  was lucky to be part of a great organization and a great team. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=224.417s">And</a>  one thing I realized, it's very important to have Mustang pride. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=229.8s">And</a>  I think that's what we're lacking right now in the city, true Mustang pride. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=234.422s">And</a>  when coach Curley came, came to the program and before that, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=240.061s">We</a>  had some difficulties. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=241.322s">Numbers</a>  were low. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=242.823s">Kids</a>  were getting in trouble. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=244.565s">You</a>  know, we weren't winning games. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=246.906s">Everybody</a>  thought that the world was ending. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=249.849s">And</a>  then you saw the bigger picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=251.83s">Coach</a>  Curley came in. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=253.932s">You</a>  saw him active in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=256.934s">You</a>  saw him doing special things with his team. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=260.817s">And</a>  all of a sudden the football team started becoming, became elevated. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=265.961s">And</a>  now the numbers have grown. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=269.151s">and</a>  positive things are in front of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=274.274s">It's</a>  all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=275.034s">That's</a>  my favorite song, by the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=277.515s">It's</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=277.935s">So</a>  now, what I wanted to address is something very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=284.438s">What</a>  is a Mustang? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=287.74s">It's</a>  not a word. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=288.64s">I</a>  know people, it's easy to say Mustang pride. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=292.782s">What</a>  it means to be a Mustang is truly to love the city you live in, to represent <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=298.62s">your</a>  community with pride and distinction. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=301.481s">And</a>  what you boys and girls have done have been amazing.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=310.645s">One</a>  thing I will say is that we have Coach Curley as your leader.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=314.446s">And</a>  that's the key, having a leader you can lean on. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=317.528s">A</a>  person that wants to be involved in a young person's life, no matter what the circumstance. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=325.317s">And</a>  it's easy to say when things aren't going well and teams aren't winning and you're losing, it's easy to say, well, they're no good, let's get rid of the coach and let's start all over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=336.325s">What</a>  I find so impressive and I want you to understand, this isn't about winning and losing. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=341.029s">You</a>  went to Fenway Park and you represented Medford with a lot of respect and pride. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=349.955s">Why</a>  I put this resolution through is for what you're doing off the field. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=356.083s">A</a>  few things that this football team has done. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=359.784s">You've</a>  helped organize the national night out with the whole football team and the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=366.147s">Really</a>  showing what unity means and how everybody works together. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=370.108s">You</a>  led that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=371.909s">In</a>  September, you helped empty out the senior citizens' basements and helped seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=378.112s">In</a>  October, you helped with the Unified Basketball League. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=383.173s">The</a>  day before Thanksgiving, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=385.307s">Before</a>  Thanksgiving game, we saw you guys over at McDonald Stadium helping with the unified flag football game. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=393.451s">Then</a>  you saw a bunch of football players in yards raking out people's yards that couldn't do it themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=400.655s">And</a>  now you're helping with the Medford Family Network for their toy drive.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=406.998s">That's</a>  amazing.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=410.012s">And</a>  I wanted to have this opportunity tonight to bring Coach Curley up and really commend you for what you have done and really put you on the pedestal that you deserve to be put on. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=426.881s">One</a>  thing is having the leader to show you the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=430.223s">And</a>  it's an honor that I talked about John Curley tonight because John's a very special person. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=435.846s">What</a>  I'd love to hear is I got a phone call from a teacher <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=439.631s">And</a>  they said, George, I saw this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=441.592s">I</a>  need to share something with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=443.973s">I</a>  had a problem with the football player. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=445.854s">He</a>  was being a little wise. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=448.036s">And</a>  I called Coach Curley. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=451.177s">And</a>  the next day, Coach Curley was sitting in the back of the room, just his presence there. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=458.561s">And</a>  what we realized is that young man wasn't offended. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=463.804s">He</a>  was so taken back that Coach Curley was there to do what? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=468.026s">To</a>  show him he cares. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=469.871s">to</a>  make sure that he's doing the right thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=473.073s">And</a>  that's the type of leadership we need in our school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=475.954s">And</a>  what you boys have done and girls have done and gone out to the community and put together all of these community service hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=481.998s">It's</a>  something we should as a city applaud. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=486.08s">So</a>  I want to publicly thank you guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=488.901s">I</a>  want we I know we put together a do we do we have that</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=514.246s">Okay,</a>  so we have accommodations that we put together the method Mustang City Council, the method City Council award the this combination to and we'll say the young man's name a young lady's name and recognition of your outstanding 2022 season. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=530.823s">with</a>  the Medford High School football team and your commitment to community service. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=534.706s">Congratulations</a>  on your accomplishments. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=536.348s">Go</a>  Mustangs. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=537.989s">If</a>  we can, I'd love just to recognize you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=539.951s">We're</a>  going to call your name up. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=541.232s">I</a>  know that Coach Curley, Coach Offer are going to help out. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=545.375s">If</a>  we can, just before we get going, if Coach Curley has anything to say, I know that before we get going, I know we want to <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=551.467s">I</a>  know some of the boys and girls want to get in and out. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=553.388s">So</a>  I know that, Coach, if you have anything to say, that'd be great.</p>

    <p>[John Curley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=556.63s">I</a>  just want to say thank you for allowing us to show what community really is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=564.573s">These</a>  kids are not told to do this stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=567.395s">They</a>  actually want to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=568.595s">It's</a>  awesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=569.976s">Just</a>  like the leaf cleanup we did, I would go to one house, and all of a sudden, I would see six kids cleaning. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=576.519s">Then</a>  I'd go to another house, and all of a sudden, I'd see like four kids cleaning. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=579.241s">There's</a>  10 kids at the house, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=580.892s">other</a>  six are on the other side of the house just grouping each other together. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=584.193s">And</a>  then the beautiful thing about our football team and our program is that we have parents involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=590.336s">Like</a>  you have parents right there here tonight that are really, really involved by like cooking meals, helping us before games, after games, taking care of stuff that we don't know about, other kids that we don't know about. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=602.741s">So</a>  it's a real big family aspect and that's, I'm very honored. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=608.077s">This</a>  is very, um, it's a really good moment for the community, not just the football team, but the community itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=614.359s">I</a>  really do appreciate this. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=615.8s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Funaiole]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=1945.747s">Thank</a>  you, everybody for having me here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=1957.916s">Um.</a> </p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=1963.019s">We</a>  have your name in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=1963.72s">We</a>  know your name and address, but if you could just introduce yourself to just forget about <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=1976.89s">we</a>  go. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=1984.915s">Thank</a>  you so much for having me here tonight.</p>

    <p>[Funaiole]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=1986.757s">So</a>  I'm here to speak specifically about a program that we have to grant that we've applied for. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=1997.124s">And</a>  I want to first just get everybody grounded in what is the Office of Prevention and Outreach. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2002.527s">The</a>  Office of Prevention and Outreach was established in 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2004.409s">Thank</a>  you to the City Council for <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2007.099s">moving</a>  that forward to address the opioid crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2011.162s">At</a>  that time, they funded my position. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2013.924s">In</a>  2017, the city council and the mayor has funded a city recovery coach position as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2022.189s">In</a>  2018, we established our Medford hub meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2025.491s">It's</a>  a crisis specific group meeting with multiple service providers to help people at the highest risk get out of risk. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2035.922s">So</a>  I want to just point that out, but these are some of the things that we've had going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2040.524s">In</a>  2020, though, we were reassigned to work on the COVID-19 response. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2046.347s">And</a>  with that, we learned a lot of different things about our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2052.21s">But</a>  I do want to say that prior to that, in the fall of 2019, we did apply for our first municipal vulnerability preparedness grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2061.274s">And</a>  I'm going to go in detail about all the work around this particular grant, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2065.77s">But</a>  I just want to point out that as I go through my presentation, there's a lot of things that we are doing that are feeding in to this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2073.614s">So</a>  I want to kind of highlight them a little bit here. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2075.735s">So</a>  we developed and operated the RUOK program. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2079.117s">We</a>  use that program as a part of fact finding for our 2020 municipal variability preparedness grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2087.762s">We</a>  had to move to a social service navigation model. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2092.031s">because</a>  we were really just coming up with a lot of people who needed support. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2096.335s">So</a>  our recovery coach at the time was also a master's in social work. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2101.479s">She</a>  took on the responsibility of doing a lot of that work throughout the pandemic and since has built that position into the department. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2109.006s">We</a>  also started the multilingual resource line and that has been a huge source of support for how we are engaging <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2117.407s">able</a>  to communicate with the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2118.888s">We</a>  had it for both the largest flows that we were having come into the office, but also really to be a place where folks with language that is not English as their first language can come to this line and can leave a message to us, for us, with us in their own language. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2137.579s">And</a>  that's really a critical step in supporting our community members to trust that we're here to support them <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2144.029s">is</a>  figuring out a way to let them be the lead of what they need and us to follow suit. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2149.692s">So</a>  we have, anyone can leave a message in any language, number one, but we have specifically Arabic, Spanish, Haitian, Creole, and then Portuguese, Brazilian, Portuguese specifically. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2163.57s">In</a>  addition to that, we started Medford Connects. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2166.232s">Medford</a>  Connects was started in May, 2020 in response to the fact that many of us were kind of stuck in our own spaces and not communicating with other departments or other agencies. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2176.308s">And</a>  so we started to come together and really start to think about what about youth mental health? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2180.711s">What</a>  about health equity? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2181.912s">How</a>  are we communicating? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2183.173s">What</a>  are you hearing in the community? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2185.154s">And</a>  this Medford Connects group really transformed. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2188.277s">We</a>  met weekly throughout the pandemic to really support each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2193.28s">And</a>  we learned a lot throughout that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2195.782s">And</a>  then we started to infuse the MVP project into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2199.004s">So</a>  just laying down the foundation. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2201.246s">The</a>  other thing I wanna make sure that I've said out loud is that we were funded through ARPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2205.749s">for</a>  a health equity coordinator who manages five community liaisons, one representing the English-speaking BIPOC community, Arabic-speaking community, Spanish-speaking community, the Haitian community, and the Brazilian community. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2218.883s">So</a>  we have those <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2220.507s">are</a>  all here working every week, and they're helping us to translate materials, they're helping us to communicate with our community members, manage this multilingual resource line, and they will begin in 2023, doing active outreach to support community members on things such as mass health applications and other applications in order to get support if they need it, in addition to just continuing to build community within <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2247.568s">these</a>  communities that haven't traditionally shown up at City Hall to have their voices heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2254.352s">So,</a>  and again, we have a social worker as well, which is Alicia Levin. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2258.434s">So</a>  in 2017, we started to really think about like, okay, so we've done a lot of this opioid crisis response. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2265.858s">We</a>  started to set up systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2267.439s">We</a>  are operating those systems still today, but we also started to think a little bit bigger and broader about what we're doing in our work around prevention and outreach. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2276.866s">And</a>  the social determinants of health is a really critical thing that we need to be working towards to address. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2283.225s">So</a>  you see these health outcomes. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2285.386s">These</a>  are all things that we know that we need to address. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2287.747s">We</a>  want to prevent, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2289.428s">But</a>  what are the behaviors that lead to these health outcomes? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2292.21s">We</a>  are also working on that, but what are we doing at this more deeper level around the social determinants of health, built environment, education, violence and trauma, employment, housing, social environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2304.976s">These</a>  are some key places where we should start doing our efforts, but even more importantly, let's take a step back and let's dig a little bit deeper down to the roots <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2312.584s">these</a>  health outcomes, and those are classism, poverty, racism, xenophobia, ageism, so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2320.008s">So</a>  we're looking at this in a comprehensive way, everything that we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2324.43s">And</a>  in 2020, when Alicia Hunt, at that time, Director of Sustainability, said, I think that this project would really fit well with the health department. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2337.816s">We</a>  said, let's think about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2339.056s">How</a>  can we understand it? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2340.837s">And</a>  so really it was an assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2342.712s">find</a>  out and brainstorm what are the community's needs? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2346.614s">What</a>  are their resiliency needs? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2351.856s">So</a>  what is community, I'm sorry, what is climate vulnerability and climate resilience? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2357.858s">These</a>  are lingo terms from the environmental sustainability industry. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2363.42s">They</a>  don't make a lot of sense to me sometimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2365.601s">They</a>  probably don't make a lot of sense to the general public. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2368.48s">So</a>  let's break it down, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2370.781s">And</a>  I am gonna read this because this is not my real house. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2373.161s">So</a>  I'm gonna do that for myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2375.662s">So</a>  climate vulnerability and resilience are measured by indicators related to exposure, sensitivity, climate hazards, coupled with the ability to get out of harm's way. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2384.978s">to</a>  adjust to changes and rebuild after a climate event. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2389.381s">We</a>  just actually experienced a major emergency event, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2394.424s">And</a>  where were we when we started the pandemic? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2397.406s">And</a>  then where did we end up after? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2399.247s">How</a>  did we recover? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2400.408s">All</a>  these things are very, they kind of apply that you can lay an overlay on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2406.052s">But</a>  the folks that are in this harms way, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2412.048s">and</a>  how fast they can adjust to changes really is indicated by rather than seeing these communities as climate vulnerable, we see communities that have been marginalized to the point of vulnerability, which is why we focus on adaptive capacity, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2429.011s">So</a>  folks that don't feel they can trust the government, they don't feel they can trust, you know, what we're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2436.472s">We</a>  need to figure out how to repair this and to work hard at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2439.773s">That's</a>  what we're trying to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2441.782s">So</a>  as you can see though, in these sensitivity, exposure, adaptive capacity, all of these things really are within the wheelhouse. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2448.984s">This</a>  is really what I just explained that we've been working towards. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2453.085s">We</a>  did learn our adaptive capacity needs in that 2020 period. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2458.166s">So</a>  we got a grant, the big pie in the sky. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2460.567s">We</a>  didn't know there was gonna be a pandemic and we were gonna do all these things to really start reaching out and understanding what the needs are. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2467.009s">And</a>  actually we were able to do that in the midst of the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2471.921s">You</a>  know, I'm really thankful for the woman who was coordinating this grant throughout the pandemic, because while we were all down in the trenches, she was moving this department forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2480.145s">So</a>  Andrea is our, she's a wonderful, wonderful partner that we've been working with. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2485.827s">We</a>  interviewed everyone that got an R U okay call. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2489.209s">They</a>  got asked a series of questions about adaptive capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2492.843s">We've</a>  built our database of knowledge there with that, and with our elder population, our senior population, but we also did multiple rounds of listening sessions in multiple languages in 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2504.813s">With</a>  that came our hub report, which you can find on the city's website. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2509.897s">That's</a>  what has established where we're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2512.359s">So</a>  then we decided to, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2517.45s">Well,</a>  we know what we know now, and we know that we need to do better outreach and engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2522.534s">We</a>  also know that we need to work on health equity. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2524.436s">We</a>  need to work on racial equity. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2526.278s">We</a>  need to understand bias, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2527.879s">Because</a>  there's also a lot going on at this time in Med. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2531.322s">So</a>  we decided to reapply for this grant and put it into three different buckets, community engagement through a team of five liaisons, provider partnership engagement through Medford Connects, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2545.625s">And</a>  then interdepartmental engagement, where we did over the last two years, bring in trainings and presentations to staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2554.793s">We</a>  talked about the nine dimensions of poverty. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2557.936s">We</a>  brought in an excellent presenter this last June and into the summer, who really talked about bias and racial bias. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2564.962s">So</a>  we've done a lot of this work as we've been going through our process. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2570.643s">And</a>  really the concept here is to build a resiliency hub. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2575.306s">So</a>  what is a resiliency hub? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2576.887s">The</a>  climate industry, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2578.648s">They</a>  believe that there's this idea that if we can have a building that's sustainable all by itself, not on the grid, that if there is an emergency, that in fact, we can go there as a community and address our needs in an emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2592.917s">That</a>  said, we need to support our communities before <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2597.67s">there's</a>  an emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2598.711s">So</a>  they know to go to this resiliency. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2600.853s">They</a>  can trust and they can predict that this is a viable place for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2604.736s">So</a>  we want to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2605.897s">We</a>  want to support communities before, during, and then after our climate emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2610.701s">So</a>  Medford Connects will expand and strengthen our community support. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2615.605s">And</a>  I've lost my picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2620.869s">To</a>  withstand, to support our marginalized groups, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2624.423s">the</a>  climate change recover from these climate crises. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2627.844s">In</a>  other words, we hope that Medford's adaptive capacity climate change by supporting our community groups will help us in these as we continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2636.408s">We</a>  know that climate change is coming, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2638.969s">It</a>  is happening now and the effects of climate change will put us in a position to have to respond and be prepared to respond. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2646.572s">So</a>  that's where we are in understanding what we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2650.101s">So</a>  as I said, we piloted our community liaison model. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2654.005s">We</a>  started reaching out to our communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2656.587s">We</a>  started thinking to ourselves, okay, so where is this mythical building in the city of Medford that we can make it energy efficient and independent? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2666.836s">And</a>  the reality is, is we don't have that building. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2670.119s">And</a>  if we have it, it's not available right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2673.382s">So</a>  we still need to do this work, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2677.173s">We</a>  got down to it and we thought, well, how can we do this differently? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2680.194s">So</a>  in our outreach to our other communities, so we were able to form an Arabic task force, we were able to form a Haitian task force, and we are currently and still reaching out to the other communities to continue to build that partnership and that understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2698.738s">but</a>  we did a lot of needs assessment to understand what would it need to have? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2703.381s">What</a>  was this resiliency need to have? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2705.622s">So</a>  instead we created a network. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2709.204s">We</a>  came up with the concept of the resiliency hub network. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2712.466s">This</a>  is an operations plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2713.847s">It's</a>  in your folder. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2715.208s">This</a>  is all working with our climate <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2719.123s">our</a>  climate partners and consultants about what is needed in Resiliency Hub. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2725.657s">What</a>  does the research say? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2726.839s">What</a>  does the industry say? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2728.202s">In</a>  addition to what does the community need and what do they say? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2731.195s">So</a>  we wanna create spaces where Metro residents can build face-to-face connections, celebrate together, support each other and access resources and services as they need them. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2740.523s">So</a>  ideally this location would be a place that you go and maybe you play cards, but you could also maybe pick up some food, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2747.77s">You</a>  could also get the information to get navigated to a social service navigation, like our Alicia, our social worker. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2757.682s">So</a>  where we are now, we did get that next round of funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2760.503s">And</a>  what we also found out was really exciting is that the state thinks our model is so important that they are now requiring this model in their future proposals from other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2770.708s">So</a>  that's very cool. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2771.888s">I'm</a>  actually proud of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2774.49s">So</a>  what are we doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2775.853s">We</a>  are going to work with our Medford Connects group, folks that have been attending this group regularly and thinking it through, like how do we work better together? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2783.716s">How</a>  do we work smoother together? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2785.737s">Medford</a>  is a social service desert. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2787.578s">We</a>  don't have our providers living within the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2790.679s">We</a>  have Wayside and their wonderful YMCA moved in to support us. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2795.542s">They</a>  have a youth center and they have Mystic Community Market. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2799.268s">And</a>  West Medford Community Center, that's really it, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2801.631s">Medford</a>  Family Network is also an agency, but they are also under the city's school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2807.457s">So</a>  it's a quasi nonprofit as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2810.14s">But</a>  these are our key supporters. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2812.522s">So</a>  we all collaborated together with a couple of departments as well to start thinking about how are we gonna communicate better and how are we gonna do this work? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2821.52s">So</a>  with this change in focus and this understanding that we don't have a physical location, we are moving to a virtual resiliency hub model, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2831.605s">We're</a>  gonna centralize and localize services and information. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2834.847s">We're</a>  gonna formalize a network of community providers, and we're going to set the foundation for resilient communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2845.232s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2847.075s">As</a>  you can see here, these are all programs that there are programs that live within the city right but how are they all connected. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2853.801s">So,</a>  there's a couple different things that we will do but one of the key things we're going to be able to do with this funding is purchase a software called unite and unite us. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2863.667s">is</a>  a system, it's a software program, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2867.689s">With</a>  a lot of extra support from that company to help us build up a network. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2872.491s">But</a>  effectively, our social worker can go in and say, this person needs housing, they need food, they need this. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2879.215s">They</a>  can refer from that system all at once to three or four different agencies, all of course partnered into the system, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2886.558s">It</a>  can't just, somebody has to receive it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2888.419s">So</a>  we have to have that formal partnership. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2890.91s">continue</a>  to work towards that and build that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2893.172s">And</a>  we hope that that will help streamline our communications and just knowing that we have a hub for crisis, but not for prevention. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2904.04s">And</a>  these efforts will help us to prevent evictions, they'll help us to prevent starvation or not being connected to services or waiting too long to get what we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2917.657s">The</a>  project is going to do a number of different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2920.68s">One</a>  of the key things that we're going to do though, is make sure that all of our partners within the hub, I mean, within the Medford Connects are going to be working on language access. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2931.971s">They're</a>  going to look at translation of key materials that they regularly put out. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2936.815s">And</a>  then we will also be working with them to get more frequent communications as we move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2943.628s">more</a>  frequent communications out in it that are smaller, you know, flyers, different blurbs that they want to put out social media, stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2952.05s">So</a>  some of the key things that we are also going to do are English for speakers of other languages. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2956.532s">So</a>  ESOL, the library and Medford family network are going to partner together and they will have a staff member who will help to build up our ESOL courses in the city and coordinate with other agencies in the area that are doing them. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2969.832s">We're</a>  gonna work with our council on aging to help them reach more diverse population and think through the communications that need to happen there. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2981.215s">We're</a>  working with the YMCA in partnership with the rec department to do youth work around social emotional skills to withstand future crises, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2990.238s">And</a>  thinking about how that can apply throughout the community as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2993.739s">We're</a>  gonna be continuing to infuse more support into the Medford Family Network. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=2998.752s">to</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3000.733s">to</a>  continue to enhance the work that she's doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3004.014s">Everyone</a>  knows Marie is the Medford, she is our heart and soul. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3007.255s">So</a>  the Medford Family Network, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3008.855s">We're</a>  gonna be working on that with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3011.356s">And</a>  then we are working with the West Medford Community Center to look at elevating by our black, indigenous and residents of color and locations of local positions of leadership and economic security. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3024.039s">So</a>  they have a really great evidence-based model that they'll be utilizing called circles <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3029.167s">that</a>  takes mentorship from a professional that's doing, you know, really enjoys their career and wants to mentor others. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3034.95s">And</a>  then they'll mentor folks and they're going to match people up in that regard. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3039.131s">And</a>  then we are working very intensely with our MISTA community market. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3050.596s">So</a>  MISTA community market will be, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3055.181s">working</a>  on a food justice council to look at how we can shape local foodscapes and systems that are shaped by people who have experienced them and not people who haven't. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3066.806s">So</a>  we'll be working with them on that as well as another of other communications, ensuring that all of their materials are translated, so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3076.276s">So</a>  this is our network here. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3078.116s">We</a>  have, as I said, I kind of went through it, but this is the visual of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3082.598s">And</a>  as you can see, all of the partners that I cited, we are also partnered with the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3089.619s">They</a>  are our guru on environment and climate change. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3094.06s">So</a>  we need their support overall, but they also, it's a great place for them to hear from our community, what's going on, hear from these partners and how they can build that into strategic planning for our community going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3107.022s">And</a>  then we have the communications department here at City Hall, who will be really looking at how they're going to be the center of disseminating how we get information out in multiple languages. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3118.992s">They're</a>  going to sort of be the point person and we're going to make sure that everything's driving throughout the network and in concert with the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3125.698s">And</a>  then finally, Diversity, Equity, Inclusion Director Frances Noget is going to help us make sure that we are <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3132.24s">doing</a>  this to the fullest and the most equitable way, and we are most inclusive. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3138.464s">In</a>  addition, she has funding to provide more trainings for the community, for our partners, for the city employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3148.872s">So</a>  the final piece of this project is that, and this is why I told you we have Medford community liaisons, we are also hiring more teams of community <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3159.273s">We're</a>  calling them Medford Connectors because we don't want to confuse anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3162.956s">We</a>  have community liaisons that are attached to the health department doing health department work. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3166.779s">And</a>  we have our community liaisons attached to this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3170.642s">We're</a>  calling them Medford Connectors. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3172.323s">They</a>  will support everyone in this network on language access, interpretation, and as well as, you know, just thinking through projects before we implement projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3184.077s">And</a>  that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3184.637s">That's</a>  all I have to really tell you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3185.897s">This</a>  is a part of the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3187.618s">It's</a>  letting you know what we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3189.598s">We</a>  are working on our contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3191.319s">We</a>  will be hiring up these Medford Connectors and all of these support staff for our grant, but we are at the start of a new process. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3200.741s">So</a>  that's it.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3203.741s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3204.381s">I</a>  know Councilor Scarpelli wants to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3206.282s">I</a>  just sent him to. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3207.539s">on</a>  an errand for Vice President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3209.401s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3210.763s">Thank</a>  you, Penny, for reaching out to me to make this presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3214.327s">I</a>  think it's really important for us to hear and for anyone who's in the community to hear the great work that we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3223.278s">I</a>  think this is really showing how we're bringing together <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3228.185s">so</a>  much of the response work and whether we're talking about climate or substance use disorder or food insecurity or housing insecurity or all the other issues that we know so many people in our community are facing, but also just bringing the community together in general and building a more resilient community. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3246.009s">I</a>  mean, I think something that we have been talking about and will continue to be talking about is social emotional support for young people in our community and also making sure that seniors have connection to the resources that they need in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3258.272s">And</a>  I just think that this is really showing that there's an intentional approach and that the staff on the ground are really doing amazing work. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3265.193s">not</a>  just in bringing in funding so that we can do this, which I know is really tough. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3270.216s">And</a>  one of the reasons that it hadn't been done before is we have huge budgetary problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3275.099s">So</a>  I'm glad that there's a pool of money that you're able to access for this, but also how we can really embed it throughout all of our public institutions from our public schools to our city departments to our nonprofit organizations going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3290.308s">It's</a>  really impressive work, really thankful to you and everyone who's been working on it and obviously continue to love to support and help out. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3299.673s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3300.413s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3301.674s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3303.115s">Thank</a>  you, Penny, for all your hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3304.595s">You've</a>  done so much for our community and I really appreciate everything you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3311.099s">So</a>  I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3312.816s">One</a>  thing I realized as I'm reading through this, this is, it's amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3315.82s">This</a>  is what we've lacked here for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3318.483s">So</a>  I appreciate your effort, but a most vulnerable community right now, have we, I didn't see anything with the housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3325.371s">Are</a>  we partnering anything with the Medford Housing Department to reach those families that I think that</p>

    <p>[Funaiole]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3331.972s">Yeah,</a>  we are partnering with them through our health equity coordinator and the work that we're doing with our social work. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3338.699s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3339.28s">We</a>  definitely are in in communication and working with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3344.024s">This</a>  is just it was just a formal partnership for the grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3347.248s">Okay,</a>  what I'm expressing.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3348.709s">So</a>  obviously, there'll be a big piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3350.111s">Yeah,</a>  definitely.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3351.212s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3351.672s">Thank</a>  you so much.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3352.934s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3355.689s">First</a>  of all, I just wanted to thank you and your department for all this work that you're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3360.733s">I</a>  think something that a few of us, many of us on this side of the rail have been talking about, a lot of community leaders have been talking about is the importance of bringing government to the people and not just expecting people to show up. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3376.926s">We</a>  all know that there are real equity access barriers when it comes to meetings, even meetings like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3384.783s">any</a>  city meeting, any coming to city events, and your department's, I think, philosophical approach to outreach, I think is something that we should be proud that we're doing as a city. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3400.196s">I</a>  know it can be really tough to do that outreach, and so I was wondering what some of the challenges that you've found were. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3411.205s">Maybe,</a>  I know the community liaisons have been doing a great job, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3414.333s">but</a>  I'm wondering what are some of the barriers that you guys have faced and what are some of the ways that you're gonna address that with the Medford Connectors program in terms of outreach and getting to more people?</p>

    <p>[Funaiole]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3430.146s">So</a>  that's a great question. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3431.267s">I</a>  mean, the major issue that we have is the same issue that every city in town is having right now and that is that there is no housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3441.873s">There's</a>  no emergency shelter. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3443.815s">Someone</a>  comes here and says, I don't have anywhere to go tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3446.277s">I</a>  don't have anywhere to send them. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3447.898s">The</a>  shelters are full, they're full early. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3450.181s">That</a>  is our biggest worry. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3453.944s">That's</a>  what we walk home at night, like we feel awful, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3457.647s">Because</a>  we don't have good answers when that happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3460.41s">And</a>  the reality is, is we have to just be very honest with people in that regard. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3466.664s">One</a>  of the things that we did do that I think what really needs to happen is that we really do need to explain what can you access here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3477.794s">So</a>  I was remiss to say that our library has incredible services. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3483.418s">They</a>  have tools that community members can use, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3487.662s">They</a>  are definitely a resiliency hub in so many regards, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3491.461s">So,</a>  driving people to these locations that can be a part of your everyday life in this community is really, really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3504.027s">And</a>  also to think about this grant is very much about that, getting people to be in and a part of, and for us to go out to and truly create this to be like a home for everyone that lives here, that this is their home, regardless of the way our society is, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3520.297s">where</a>  a lot of people live online right and they talk online and they commune online and stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3526.409s">So,</a>  you know, one of the key things we want to continue to do is describe city services right like <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3532.387s">what</a>  kind of violations do people get parking violations, trash, maybe violations, right, like these things that are costly to community members, we need to communicate better what those are and what the rules are, and have access to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3545.154s">So</a>  it's not like, you know, my artworks at City Hall, and I know that I could I could do this, we need to just make those things a little bit more ready for everybody in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3553.498s">And</a>  when the website, when the new website is up, we do have recorded videos, audio videos in other languages about most of the city services, sort of like a FAQ for each department. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3564.423s">We</a>  have that like ready and prepared from the previous round of funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3567.384s">We</a>  just need to get it up live and out. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3570.706s">I</a>  don't know that I really answered your question, but I think the issue is, is that us becoming more connected and communicative is really, really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3579.917s">There</a>  is another, but what we are currently faced with is so overwhelming. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3584.14s">It's</a>  much like that opioid crisis is like, where do we even begin? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3588.284s">And</a>  really there's things the state has to do to make those changes to support our community members.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3594.885s">You</a>  guys have been doing incredible work. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3596.866s">I</a>  really appreciate that answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3598.207s">And</a>  what you were talking about, and I think the work you guys are doing, I think, lays out a foundation for what other departments in the city can do, including the city council, maybe in the further future. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3610.514s">I</a>  think you guys are testing the waters, seeing what works, and perhaps in the future, our city council and other branches of government, other departments of the government can look towards you guys and see <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3623.465s">what</a>  we can do to be more inclusive to get more of those voices that haven't been included in city government to help us come to our meetings and help us, you know, give us feedback and shape our agendas. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3635.249s">So</a>  that's helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3636.47s">I</a>  think my question was slightly, slightly more about <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3640.371s">How</a>  are we reaching the residents that we haven't reached yet, which I know can be a really difficult question to answer and I'm sure you guys are already working on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3648.082s">I</a>  was wondering if you guys partner with other city departments to, you know, keep track of who comes in for city services already or <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3656.652s">In</a>  terms of maybe a city, the work that we do collecting server data with our city city census type things, seeing if I think who moves into the city, pays our taxes perhaps there's a way to, even in, I know this can be costly but putting, putting <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3675.302s">even</a>  a short flyer in our water bills or something like that to try to get more people aware that your department exists, that the work that you guys are doing exists. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3685.968s">And</a>  maybe that will reach more people, but you are the expert here, so.</p>

    <p>[Funaiole]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3690.75s">Yeah,</a>  I think that you're totally right. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3693.051s">One</a>  of the things that we're looking at is like, okay, so we need to continue to build relationships with all of our faith communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3699.694s">That's</a>  one key thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3701.076s">The</a>  other piece that we are working on actively right now is going through our entire database of businesses and working in that angle as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3710.803s">So,</a>  I think that I'll have a better answer and a more concrete answer for you in about six months when we get all of our staff in place and people are moving and operating. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3723.232s">But</a>  I wanna say though, one of the key things that has been a benefit since the RUOK or our social service navigation began <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3731.376s">is</a>  that we have 89 referrals from city employees to the social worker to get somebody help. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3736.937s">So</a>  we're definitely getting the word out across the city departments that we can help individuals that, you know, the other thing to note is that if I show up and I say I have a housing issue, I have other things that I need to be processed through. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3752.34s">So</a>  that's why we really want our city social worker to kind of work with that person and ask those really like, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3758.785s">really</a>  hard questions for someone to reflect on. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3761.706s">And</a>  so we really do want city department, we want our folks that work here to get the person to the right place in order to get the information that they need, that that actually will be able to be viable, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3774.592s">Just</a>  giving someone a pamphlet doesn't solve their issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3778.194s">We're</a>  not gonna solve their issue either, but we can at least give them the correct information and the correct numbers.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3783.874s">That's</a>  excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3785.095s">And</a>  I think to what you've been saying, you know, as a son of immigrant parents, I've had to translate a lot of things, find out a lot of things about city services. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3795.643s">It</a>  would be super helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3797.804s">The</a>  things that you're describing will be super helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3799.766s">So,</a>  and I think lay out groundwork for, you know, the work that we want to do on youth mental health on, you know, making our community safer as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3808.372s">So</a>  thank you so much.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3809.093s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3813.123s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3814.004s">I</a>  don't know if Councilor Tang just asked my question, but I don't see the Asian population represented here. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3820.248s">And</a>  they're the largest growing segment of our community right now.</p>

    <p>[Funaiole]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3823.51s">And</a>  I don't know- So our plan is for this particular grant round is to expand one of our roles. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3831.095s">We</a>  have a BIPOC connector role, and we want to really relegate that and reach out to the Asian community.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3839.74s">I</a>  was with some people in Somerville and they just put on <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3843.054s">an</a>  Asian liaison in their community. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3845.476s">So</a>  I hope that we can do that.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3846.717s">Thank</a>  you so much for pointing that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3849.119s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3849.539s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3852.361s">Thank</a>  you so much, Penny, for being here tonight and for presenting, you know, some of the process and progress that's gone into the work that this grant has enabled. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3859.967s">I</a>  think, you know, over the past year, this grant, I mean, I know it's gone on for more than the past year, but you know, what's come out of this has been one of the things that I, you know, feel most proud of in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3869.935s">It's</a>  really <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3871.024s">great</a>  to be able to see some first steps towards language equity, doing a better job of reaching out to the people who, you know, historically do not show up to city hall or not reached out to don't speak the language, you know, in whatever way, I think this is really important work. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3883.874s">Um,</a>  and it's great to get sort of these concrete facts about what specifically has been done, what the grant has been, has enabled the city to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3891.84s">Um,</a>  I think that it's important for us to get a picture of what, um, doing that, doing that work of bringing <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3897.22s">more</a>  of the community into community spaces, how that breaks down into roles and positions and programs, kind of gives those numbers some context. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3906.643s">As</a>  a Councilor, and I know that you in your office, you get this 10 times more than we do, but we hear from people looking for housing, we hear from people who are looking for pro bono legal representation, the eviction crisis in Medford Square several months ago, eviction help, tenant organizing, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3924.197s">I've</a>  been very involved with the mutual aid network for several years. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3928.02s">What</a>  strikes me every time these conversations come up is it seems like over and over again, we hit against the fact that even our provider network are very close to hitting their bandwidth. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3939.631s">And</a>  I know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3942.487s">It's</a>  in my mind so strongly all the time that our regional network of providers is inundated. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3949.49s">There's</a>  so much need, you said for housing, food insecurity, there's so much need. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3953.231s">And</a>  I know that that's one of the many things that we need a regional approach for, we need more state assistance for. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3959.773s">Where</a>  this comes in as I think, given that it's so important for us to streamline on the local level as much as possible to make sure that everybody in our community who needs those resources can access them in an easy way. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3970.752s">I</a>  think this program is doing that and that everybody in the community can have equitable access to the resources that are available. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3976.597s">And</a>  I really hope that that work can continue in parallel with regionally and with our other providers working to make sure that we have more places to direct people to. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3986.305s">I'm</a>  sure it's heartbreaking for your staff every time you have to say, I can get you on that wait list. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3991.309s">I</a>  can get you on that list. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3992.39s">I</a>  can't get you on that wait list. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3993.991s">And</a>  I'm sure that's really hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3997.303s">I</a>  just thank you for this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3998.223s">I'm</a>  really excited to see how it continues. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=3999.824s">And</a>  like vice president Baird said, so anyway, this council can support you and continue that work. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4005.126s">We're</a>  partners with you.</p>

    <p>[Funaiole]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4006.266s">Thank</a>  you so much.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4007.226s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4014.488s">Penny,</a>  I just had one question. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4015.429s">So</a>  you mentioned part of the work really needing to lean on the communications department at city hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4020.27s">So</a>  I understand that the communications department is essentially, it's one person. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4023.551s">So</a>  is there any funding in this grant <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4026.932s">you</a>  know, funds additional communication support, because I think that's something we always run into in all aspects of city hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4032.394s">And</a>  I also, I don't want to detract from any of your work. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4034.494s">This</a>  is incredible work, the work of you, the liaisons, everyone, like this is so much work. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4039.376s">I</a>  want to make sure, you know, communication supports that, but understanding how under, you know, it's one person, so.</p>

    <p>[Funaiole]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4046.418s">So</a>  we have, the city has hired a COVID-19, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4054.877s">communications</a>  support. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4056.658s">So</a>  there is two people now, that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4058.959s">So</a>  that's excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4062.44s">And</a>  I think that that role really is absolutely applicable to supporting this grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4068.723s">So</a>  we do have that as a fortunate positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4071.364s">We</a>  do have a little bit of money to go along like formal translations. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4076.186s">It's</a>  not a lot of money to be able to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4078.407s">Obviously</a>  that's a big budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4080.547s">So</a>  we have to be obviously thoughtful about what we're gonna use that funding for, but we do have the money relegated to help them to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4087.513s">And</a>  then I think that's all I was supposed to say.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4092.117s">Okay,</a>  thank you, I appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4096.001s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Caraviello to receive and place on file second by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4100.144s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4101.506s">Thank</a>  you, Penny.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4485.028s">Has</a>  the law department ever called you and said, the city council has asked us to draft <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4492.665s">No,</a>  the law department's never called me. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4493.926s">So</a>  the law department hasn't called you, the chief of staff hasn't called you, the mayor's office hasn't called you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4498.029s">But</a>  this council's taking at least a dozen affirmative votes to get this information.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4508.195s">But</a>  then tonight, we have a paper before us to create another new job and give somebody else another raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4515.16s">I</a>  mean, come on.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4524.327s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Newton. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4525.147s">Yeah,</a>  and just to clarify.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4526.508s">I</a>  feel bad that they said you already had to fall on your sword and be a sacrificial lamb.</p>

    <p>[John Curley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4530.048s">I'm</a>  fine with falling on a sword.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4532.309s">Because</a>  we do, we vote on these papers. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4534.009s">They're</a>  supposed to go to the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4535.289s">The</a>  administration is supposed to send them to the parties that they're about. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4539.51s">So</a>  if you're not getting them.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4541.011s">I</a>  will make sure that I'm getting them. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4542.691s">And</a>  I will make sure that you're getting the information that you need.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4545.912s">Yeah,</a>  I can also always, you know, I can reach out. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4547.872s">I</a>  can have the clerk reach out after the fact, if it's not getting there.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4551.795s">Point</a>  of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4554.037s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4556.419s">If</a>  we could, I think it sounds like we should just get on paper right now what we're asking for.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4561.603s">That</a>  would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4563.304s">And</a>  part of this is me being new. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4567.487s">I'm</a>  not coordinating with the mayor's office.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4570.73s">I</a>  mean, new or not, if you're not getting the papers, you're not getting the papers. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4573.392s">So</a>  it's not your fault.</p>

    <p>[John Curley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4575.594s">I</a>  don't want to be saying that they're somehow remiss.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4580.161s">It's</a>  not exclusive to the finance department, Bob. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4582.863s">It's</a>  almost, unless we make the outreach directly, every paper that we submit to the mayor's office to almost any department, we're not getting the response in a timely manner or a complete manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4593.611s">So</a>  I just want to put that out there and I'm not going to ask you to say that, I'll say it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4599.075s">The</a>  first thing I want to just get on, so yes, I think the first thing we'd really like to see would be the AP warrants from January, 2020 to present. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4609.545s">And</a>  I know that's probably a pretty big file, but I think we'd all like to see it electronically and also to be sent to the clerk to be delivered to us.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4616.948s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4617.888s">It</a>  would simply be these, these are the vendors who are paid this warrant.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4621.949s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4622.23s">And</a>  I mean, we can also send you an example of what the previous finance or finance director gave us for specific bills would have to be looked up if you wanted to see a specific bill, but it will say, you know, we paid Joe Schmo $600.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4635.522s">of</a>  this account. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4636.702s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4637.263s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4637.823s">I</a>  can also have the clerk setting when the records are ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4641.024s">Control</a>  F, find your name. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4643.105s">And</a>  you can also see this right now.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4645.106s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4645.286s">I</a>  mean, the other thing we can send you is Aleesha Nunley Benjamin did provide us with copies of what we call warrant articles. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4651.808s">And</a>  we can provide you an example of that so that you can see what those reports were like. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4658.89s">And</a>  then the two things that you said that you have with you tonight, you said you had a quarter one</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4664.051s">What</a>  are one budget to actual with the votes that you took on the 28th for the general fund and water sewer?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4669.114s">And</a>  then the other thing that you said is you have revenue projections.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4672.496s">Well,</a>  I have first quarter revenue compared to first quarter revenue from fiscal 2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4679.42s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4681.762s">It's</a>  stuck in my computer. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4683.403s">I</a>  can email these files to you if you prefer.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4685.804s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4686.445s">I</a>  do have paper copies of this along with the budget stuff along with the vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4692.448s">to</a>  a copy of the vote that was taken.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4694.029s">Do</a>  you have multiple copies? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4696.851s">Oh</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4697.351s">Can</a>  you hand them, can you pass them to Larry and he'll get them to us?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4700.173s">Yeah,</a>  and I don't mean this to be exhaustive. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4702.455s">I'm</a>  sure other Councilors are going to have other items, but basically what would be also very helpful is if you could take anything, anything that we request tonight, send them to us in a digital format and the clerk in a digital format, he can provide it to us in a print format. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4715.944s">And</a>  then if we can have that, you know, maybe by the end of this week, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4721.207s">then</a>  we could have a full presentation from you in January, as Councilor Knight had requested, where we've had time to review the documents in advance to ask, have our questions ready.</p>

    <p>[Richard Orlando]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4731.649s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4733.07s">It</a>  might also be helpful to go talk to the city clerk and say, hey, can I see a copy of the council tracking sheet? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4738.811s">It</a>  says finance director, because there's probably literally 40 requests that we're looking for out of your office over the course of the last year.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4749.597s">All</a>  right, well, I apologize that I haven't acted on. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4754.562s">I</a>  will follow up with that.</p>

    <p>[Puccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4757.164s">I'm</a>  through, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4759.246s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4760.086s">Bob,</a>  again, the other person taking the heat and I apologize for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4767.613s">It's</a>  not fair to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4771.36s">No,</a>  no, and I'm not going to pile on. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4773.741s">I</a>  think that we should, you know, I think for preparations purposes, I think that maybe calling for a committee of the whole meeting with Bob, once we have all this information. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4786.229s">so</a>  we can sit down and really sink our teeth into these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4790.211s">This</a>  is something that, so you understand Bob, something as simplistic as people that are watching understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4797.595s">When</a>  I was 14, I opened up a checking account. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4799.716s">My</a>  dad said, okay, this is how you balance your checkbook. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4803.498s">This</a>  is how you spend your money. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4805.519s">And</a>  if you don't have, if you have $100 in your account and you want to purchase something for $120, it's telling you you can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4814.63s">and</a>  you're responsible to control your own finance. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4817.772s">Unfortunately,</a>  what we're seeing time after time here, we're getting papers from the mayor, we're getting requests from different Councilors about asking for money papers. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4828.097s">And</a>  to be honest, I haven't voted for a financial paper and approval in a long time, because I find it very difficult for this body to do their job, not understanding the basic <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4840.516s">financial</a>  breakdowns of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4842.777s">You</a>  were there when we had the tough budget process. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4845.638s">It</a>  was horrifying for you being new. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4847.799s">And</a>  as we're going through this process, but we haven't gotten one, one paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4852.641s">We</a>  haven't gotten any information about where we're spending our money. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4856.062s">And</a>  here we are, we've got almost January, January one. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4860.123s">So</a>  I want the public to know this is the hardship we're feeling the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4867.386s">We</a>  don't have a city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4868.667s">I'm</a>  trying to ask questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4870.398s">about</a>  legal matters and we don't have anybody to turn to. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4874.259s">And</a>  I apologize that you have to be here tonight and really be hung out to dry. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4879.501s">I'm</a>  curious if the chief of staff is here.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4882.962s">I</a>  did see her on the call earlier.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4894.006s">She</a>  is on the call. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4895.566s">If</a>  I can, can we address the question to her? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4899.412s">Madam</a>  Chief of Staff, are you there?</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4915.715s">I</a>  think it's a simple question. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4917.455s">I</a>  know that the chief of staff has been out for legitimate reasons and she hasn't, she just started to ramp back up, but were you familiar that our finance director hasn't received any of this information from this council?</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4938.965s">I'm</a>  not sure I would phrase it that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4941.766s">However,</a>  I would state that <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4944.095s">Both</a>  he and I have been discussing the matter, attempting to work on what specifically it is that the council's looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4950.699s">I</a>  think that this is a matter of language. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4953.3s">And</a>  I've also been working to try to find out what historically the city council has received. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4958.703s">But</a>  again, as you stated, I'm returning from leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4961.165s">So</a>  this is a matter that's important to myself, the administration, the finance director. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4968.329s">I</a>  believe we all intend and want to provide this information. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4973.111s">So</a>  I apologize that it hasn't been provided yet and I take responsibility for that.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4981.715s">I'm</a>  just curious if a rank and file employee, say in the Medford DPW for a year and a half, failed to provide you with information that you requested, what would happen to them?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4994.701s">President</a>  Morell, through you, I take that as a rhetorical question.</p>

    <p>[Nina Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5001.439s">So</a>  again, I heard your answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5003.16s">I</a>  don't appreciate the response.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5005.221s">I</a>  think that this has been a total lack of disrespect to this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5009.142s">We</a>  have</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5030.185s">We</a>  have crises that we're dealing with right now that we're looking at financial support and hoping for some financial support. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5037.708s">And</a>  we don't know where we are financially. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5043.051s">So</a>  to move forward with any of these dog and pony requests and then ask for funding for deeply needed resolves and not having an understanding of where we are financially, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5060.265s">is</a>  very difficult for me as a Councilor to make decisions moving the city forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5068.948s">I</a>  hope everybody that's watching and understands realizes how dysfunctional this community looks right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5080.252s">There</a>  are so many issues that we're seeing that coming across from us. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5084.213s">And</a>  this is so totally embarrassing. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5086.974s">I'm</a>  disheartened right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5088.415s">So</a>  Bob, again, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5090.1s">I</a>  apologize for the answer that the chief of staff just gave. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5094.181s">The</a>  understanding is this, we have been asking for money papers, I think, I believe from the day after we had our budget, and we've been trying to get some information, some valuable information of where we're going, what direction we're in. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5107.226s">We're</a>  trying to figure out what, tonight's a very important meeting, there's some resolutions tonight, we're talking about some very important issues, and looking to fund some very important issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5116.609s">But</a>  getting the okay from the administration <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5119.723s">to</a>  fund papers, and then not understanding where we are, because I believe you were there when the mayor said, as critical as last year's budget was, next year's is gonna be even worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5131.15s">And</a>  what puts me on edge right now, Bob, is the fact that we haven't seen anything, and we can't move to support our most neediest members of our community and resolutions that are coming forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5143.798s">So</a>  I find this very disheartening. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5146.219s">I</a>  find this very troubling. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5148.017s">And</a>  I don't know how my 16, 17 year old daughter has the ability to run her finances better than what we're seeing with this multimillion dollar corporation called Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5165.743s">So,</a>  and again, I know it's not you Bob, but I have to express my concerns and discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5171.825s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5172.705s">Councilors</a>  at some point it is going to be me. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5175.126s">So</a>  I'm just to let you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5178.108s">We</a>  have had staffing issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5179.969s">Tina's</a>  been out, Tyler quit. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5182.231s">We've</a>  got a very, very good person to take over from Tyler. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5185.994s">She</a>  is already working on the 2024 budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5190.717s">We've</a>  already had meetings on it with all the department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5196.422s">So</a>  we're working on that right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5199.624s">We</a>  got the recap done. <a

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5683.281s">My</a>  knee-jerk reaction was quickly defended to the categorization of being looked at and politicizing this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5693.929s">Then</a>  I thought about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5695.951s">Of</a>  course I'm politicizing this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5698.853s">Because</a>  that's the only way, the only mechanism that we, our kids, and the citizens have to make any changes to our system. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5707.239s">We</a>  live in a political system that requires checks and balances to protect our citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5713.588s">So</a>  being attacked with this term makes no sense and showed me exactly how those that are guilty continue to deflect away from their own inaction, neglect, and responsibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5728.358s">Well,</a>  we've learned that inaction equals action, meaning inaction enabled these outcomes, putting our kids in harm's way and making our parents petrified to send our kids to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5743.744s">That's</a>  the atrocity that we are looking at today, right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5751.029s">If</a>  anyone has been politicizing this issue, it's those that have been both enabling these outcomes and hiding from the consequences of their own inactions. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5762.075s">We</a>  were elected by the people, for the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5765.958s">It's</a>  time that we get to work for the people, especially our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5772.082s">See,</a>  when <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5773.262s">We</a>  got elected by the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5776.724s">It</a>  should not be measured by winning or losing. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5780.025s">It</a>  should be measured by the impact that we make and promises that we keep. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5787.688s">This</a>  is our opportunity that has presented itself to us today. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5792.07s">The</a>  question was presented, what are we going to do about it? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5798.273s">Here's</a>  what I propose to get us united, back on track and protect our kids <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5803.299s">the</a>  way that they require from us. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5808.322s">First,</a>  I'm going to be asking the mayor to put together a team so we can put an implementation of safety that works with our teachers, our principals, our police department, so our kids feel safe when they go back on January 3rd. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5832.841s">We</a>  want them to feel safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5835.663s">Meetings,</a>  consultants, that's passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5840.007s">We</a>  have true professionals in our building that we can work together over the next two weeks to make sure we have that plan in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5846.672s">I'm</a>  sure of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5850.232s">I</a>  have resolutions in place this evening that would ask the mayor to prepare an RFP to hire and train true security guards, four to five. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5862.238s">Make</a>  sure that we have full staffing in the video room where our staff can watch a minute to minute action and who's going into the bathrooms, who's loitering in the hallways to make sure our administration can see where these issues are happening and get <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5879.017s">the</a>  support there as soon as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5882.7s">Last</a>  night, I believe it was Tony Puccio who brought up a very simple resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5889.946s">We</a>  ask our parents today to do everything, to be involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5894.669s">And</a>  he mentioned that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5896.11s">I</a>  thought that was a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5897.191s">When</a>  I got home, I got a phone call from a former soccer captain. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5900.294s">She</a>  went to school in Tulane, worked in Louisiana, and she sent me an article about <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5906.175s">a</a>  program they use in the schools in Louisiana where they were having issues and concerns like we're having today. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5912.557s">It's</a>  called Dads in the Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5914.598s">Maybe,</a>  to be correct, we'll call it Dads and Moms in the Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5918.539s">If</a>  we could put parents on a bus to go to a field trip to Plymouth Rock, then we could put parents in the school that want to assist our teachers to make sure they're just an extra eyes and ears as we walk the halls. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5930.442s">So</a>  I thank you, Mr. Puccio, for bringing that forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5933.638s">I'm</a>  going to ask the school committee to open up their meetings for public participation, where there's a dialogue like last evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5943.006s">So</a>  if there's an issue with parents, students, or constituents, they have this forum to come and speak with a dialogue back and forth to make sure things are identified. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5955.217s">The</a>  process that's in place right now, as some parents can tell you tonight, very daunting. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5961.148s">to</a>  put it through, to ask to get approval, to read something, to write something up and making sure that what is going to be presented is approved is another form of censorship. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5975.558s">If</a>  not, I'm gonna request this council to go back to the original request that Councilor Knight and I put forth as a ordinance change demanding that we put in place that format for the City School Committee so they have an avenue <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5990.918s">to</a>  have a voice and they can listen.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=5996.0s">So</a>  this has been a very intense last 24 hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6003.804s">My</a>  daughter didn't go to school, nor did I believe close to 400 other students.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6012.088s">The</a>  word back was that the police were there and they were present. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6016.01s">But</a>  we also know that won't happen every single day for the rest of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6021.712s">So</a>  I implore our school committee to work together with the police department to move forward to making sure that there's a plan in place over the next few weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6034.401s">So</a>  we have our children feeling safe.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6042.287s">And</a>  that leaves me with one thing.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6047.491s">I</a>  know that she's not here right now, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6050.025s">But</a>  I want, I heard something last night from a very courageous young lady and I want to leave with something that she said that I take it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6057.728s">It</a>  was directed to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6058.868s">It's</a>  direct to all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6060.469s">It</a>  was very simple to, as she said, step up a step down.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6065.23s">We</a>  have a responsibility and I hope we hear it.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6071.848s">We</a>  have a responsibility to make sure that we're giving the tools to our leaders in the school, our principals and assistant principals, to make sure that they can run the schools as efficient as they did when they led the middle schools or before this administration, when they were part of the resolutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6093.064s">So</a>  let's unify this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6095.966s">Let's</a>  unify our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6098.831s">and</a>  let's make Medford the city that it's always been, an amazing place to live, work, and raise their family. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6107.898s">So</a>  thank you, Madam President.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6117.425s">Excuse</a>  me.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6121.688s">I</a>  also had a grandchild that went to school today either because of her fear. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6126.962s">Instead</a>  of being here tonight advocating for funding, hiring teachers, school repairs, or asking for supplies, I'm here tonight to add my voice to the groundswell of anger and outrage that so many are feeling regarding the recent violence at Bedford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6141.971s">So</a>  now I am demanding adequate resources, security, to help keep our students safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6149.195s">First</a>  off, let's get one thing straight. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6151.417s">Stabbing</a>  yesterday was not an isolated incident. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6154.09s">Fully</a>  has been going on for a long time at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6157.291s">Didn't</a>  just start yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6158.311s">A</a>  gun clip found in a middle school auditorium during a school vacation was an isolated incident. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6165.852s">No</a>  one was hurt. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6167.052s">Gun</a>  clips by themselves don't hurt people, but knives and physical violence do. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6172.333s">Everyone</a>  who engages in the community could see this coming a mile away. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6176.034s">Fully</a>  has been escalated, unchecked since the start of the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6181.615s">But</a>  rather than address the situation on early, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6184.313s">school</a>  officials, superintendent, school committee, and the mayor consistently downplayed each and every incident, hoping it would go away. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6191.438s">It</a>  was unconscionable that no comment, acknowledgement, or plan of action was implemented immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6197.362s">What</a>  are we thinking? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6199.323s">We</a>  all know when people aren't thinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6202.926s">Yesterday's</a>  school committee meeting was another pointless charade of the council needs to work together and not yell at us. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6208.669s">Let</a>  me tell you something. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6209.69s">I've</a>  been working here for 11 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6211.551s">I've</a>  gotten yelled at many times. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6214.303s">If</a>  you can't take getting yelled at, then don't run for office. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6217.804s">I've</a>  been willing to work together with any elected body since the first day I was elected. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6222.425s">People</a>  are justifiably angry. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6224.086s">It's</a>  become quite clear that when the teachers had a vote of no confidence, it was directed to the school committee and the mayor's chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6231.568s">I'm</a>  tired of seeing my city, Medford, in the media recently, with a glaring negative spotlight now focused on our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6239.97s">It's</a>  evident that we're not ready for this prime time. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6243.868s">I</a>  was astonished to hear our superintendent say on television last night, we don't encourage bringing weapons to school, encourage. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6252.896s">Statement</a>  I find boggles to say at least. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6255.158s">How</a>  about zero tolerance statement for any weapons and violence of any kind, and we'll act swiftly and with determination to eradicate this unacceptable behavior and prosecute anyone who violates this policy to the fullest extent of the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6272.1s">That's</a>  what our superintendent should have said. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6274.761s">Here's</a>  another mind twister. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6276.742s">Biffin</a>  High has no expulsion policy or program in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6280.044s">What</a>  measures does it send? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6282.786s">Do</a>  you want, and don't worry, you won't get kicked out of school. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6286.768s">After</a>  all, everyone is entitled to an education. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6290.17s">No,</a>  not if they're a danger to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6292.991s">And</a>  all this begs the question, where is the mayor in all this?

<a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6303.862s">First,</a>  keep the police present in our high school indefinitely. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6309.566s">392</a>  students called out today. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6311.648s">Students,</a>  teachers, and parents demand a safe learning environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6315.731s">This</a>  is a first step. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6317.172s">Bring</a>  in Councilors to talk to our affected students and ensure them that the situation now finally is being addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6325.198s">Schedule</a>  multiple listening sessions for parents and community members to express their feelings and vent. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6331.264s">Give</a>  them your absolute promise that this ends now. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6336.087s">Go</a>  through the school incident logs and put problem students on the notice immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6341.17s">Again,</a>  it's an insult to say this was an outside incident. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6344.332s">The</a>  kids at the school have seen a growing power vacuum of non-discipline with the recent bully and failing body to act up themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6353.597s">It's</a>  copycat pure violence and simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6356.419s">Lastly,</a>  hold yourself accountable and admit that <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6360.731s">You</a>  minimize the problem instead of deflecting the blame. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6364.172s">That's</a>  the only way to move forward from this. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6365.793s">The</a>  principal and superintendents should put a clear professional plan in place to start 2023 right. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6370.975s">We</a>  owe it to our children and their future. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6374.377s">We</a>  can fix mistakes that were made, but if someone loses their life due to needless violence, that's not a mistake that anyone can fix. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6383.76s">I'm</a>  proud to be a graduate of Bedford High School and I have many fond memories of my time there. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6388.522s">What</a>  kind of memories are these children gonna have <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6390.813s">for</a>  the eight years at Medford High. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6393.274s">We</a>  can change that, but we've got to act now. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6396.935s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7027.413s">You</a>  know, Councilor Scarpelli and others were calling for urgent action. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7031.054s">We're</a>  calling for the council to act within its purview to try and be part of the solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7035.596s">And</a>  I completely agree, completely agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7039.157s">You</a>  know, we have to use our powers as city councilors to try and be part of the solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7043.138s">We</a>  aren't the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7045.147s">We</a>  can't be the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7046.748s">We</a>  can't make the type of the decisions that the school committee is empowered to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7050.89s">We</a>  can use the powers that we have as the city council to try to direct resources where they need to go, to try to be a part of the community-wide conversation, to emphasize the voices of the folks that are most affected by this, to listen to the people who know best where those resources need to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7065.118s">And</a>  I'm glad that we get to be a part of that conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7067.88s">I</a>  hope that going forward, this can be more collaborative <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7072.073s">that</a>  we can all do our specific roles, but in concert with each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7075.415s">And</a>  lastly, since Councilor Scarpelli's resolution calls for public input, if anybody's here to give input, I just want to acknowledge that not everybody does feel comfortable speaking in public, especially on live TV. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7086.52s">It's</a>  not for the faint of heart. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7088.221s">And</a>  also not every comment, especially when kids and school security is involved, is best said in a public setting. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7095.425s">I</a>  just want to restate for the record, whether we're in session or not, I'm available. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7100.899s">to</a>  any resident, to any constituent, to field ideas, to hear your questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7106.083s">If</a>  you just need a listening ear, if you don't feel comfortable speaking tonight, you can always reach out to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7112.149s">We're</a>  available. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7114.09s">So</a>  I just wanted to say that at the outset of any community input. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7118.234s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7119.275s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7120.976s">Vice</a>  President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7123.658s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7127.041s">Nobody's</a>  happy.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7129.992s">There's</a>  disagreements about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7132.514s">I</a>  don't think there's any single person. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7134.275s">And</a>  if there is, they got to get checked out who was happy about what happened yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7139.019s">I</a>  think everyone agrees and agreed six months ago, or two months ago, or two days ago, that there are things that need to be improved, that there are problems that need to be solved, that we're not <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7155.64s">always,</a>  and even if we had solved them, that we're not always going to get it 100% right 100% of the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7167.063s">Now,</a>  how we address those problems, how we build processes, how we improve systems, how we address systemic challenges, is by putting forward solutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7179.006s">The</a>  thing that we're talking about in resolutions coming later than this are some ideas around that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7187.291s">But</a>  I think also it's important to look back at what we've heard from our school committee and school administration, what we've heard from this council, when it comes to the budget and the funding of our schools, when it comes to the resources that we need, when it comes to the resources that we need in this moment, when we know, hey, there was violence at Medford High School when I was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7214.064s">There</a>  was violence at Medford High School 30 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7216.809s">And</a>  we can talk about certain numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7218.59s">The</a>  one number that hasn't been talked about any of this is actually looking at the trends and data on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7224.435s">But</a>  the one thing we do know is whether it's Medford or a neighboring community or every community in Massachusetts or every community in this country is that student supports are deeply needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7235.523s">That</a>  mental health is a serious issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7237.925s">That</a>  conflict resolution and addressing problems in a peaceful manner is a huge problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7244.61s">And</a>  that quite frankly, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7247.172s">Before</a>  these things got worse, it was a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7250.134s">It's</a>  an even worse problem now. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7252.195s">Students</a>  are walking out because they recognize it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7254.696s">Students</a>  are crying out because they know that they need help or they know someone who needs help. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7259.438s">It's</a>  a question of resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7261.879s">The</a>  first thing I thought about when I ran for office was the funding for our schools three years ago, that was before the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7266.942s">It</a>  was my first concern in June when we were talking about the fiscal 23 budget and the $2.8 million that got cut from our schools at the last minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7277.263s">two</a>  weeks ago, it was again, where I was focusing my energy and efforts in a resolution that passed this council about funding and asking what are the supports? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7287.812s">What</a>  are the funding that's needed? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7290.574s">Another</a>  thing that needs resources and funding, we were just talking about it for municipal vulnerability plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7295.378s">We're</a>  just talking about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7297.379s">When</a>  we talk about this whole city, schools and city side communications and engagement, the city doesn't invest its budgetary resources in that issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7305.906s">So</a>  we have <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7307.922s">you</a>  know, people scrambling to put something together to get it out when there's an emergency situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7313.345s">We</a>  have in a million other situations insufficient resources for communication and engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7322.13s">So</a>  all of these things, no one is happy here. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7326.092s">We've</a>  all identified problems that we want to solve. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7329.214s">We're</a>  starting to talk about solutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7331.836s">The</a>  big elephant in the room solution that we don't want to zone in on <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7336.062s">is</a>  that we don't have the resources to address the scope of the problems that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7340.443s">And</a>  until we are willing to admit that and engage in a good faith discussion about what is the true scope of resources that we need to invest in our schools and in our community to address the sheer scale of the problems that we have, we're not going to unify or come together or solve these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7361.027s">And</a>  they are of a scope and scale we could not have imagined four years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7366.065s">So</a>  that's the crux of this whole question. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7370.129s">We</a>  come together in government to pool our resources to address our collective problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7376.795s">That</a>  is what we do more than anything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7380.278s">And</a>  we've clearly identified a collective problem that needs resources and the resources, we are literally unable to put those resources on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7390.396s">Now,</a>  I think there are things that we can do and should do and try to do in the short term, medium and long term with what we have to better target what we have and do the best that we can do with what we have, but that's not going to be enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7407.951s">The</a>  other two things I want to talk about here are that we are once again, not going to <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7415.216s">get</a>  unified and be on the same page and be able to move forward collectively, unless we are moving on a single set of facts about who has the authority to do what, who has the power to do what, and who sets the rules about what. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7430.705s">The</a>  state and the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education set a number of rules about a lot of the things that we're talking about tonight, or have talked about in previous meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7441.331s">The</a>  state defines the scope. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7443.437s">of</a>  the authority of the school committee and the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7446.54s">The</a>  one place where we truly do have authority is on this fundamental core question of funding and the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7453.885s">That</a>  is where we can partner. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7455.707s">And</a>  I know that there's a resolution from Councilor Scarpelli on that question and a resolution from Councilor Collins and I on that question, because that is where we can most and best engage in this discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7466.936s">And</a>  I don't say that to limit that there may be other things, but that is where our authority and power lies. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7473.592s">And</a>  the last thing I'm gonna say, people aren't gonna be happy about it, and I'm not happy about everything that everyone else has said, so I'm just gonna go ahead and say it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7484.896s">I</a>  don't know what veiled accusations about national organizations are going to get us anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7491.398s">When</a>  we have information that is not correct out there about why people are making decisions that they're making, or what decisions have been made, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7500.64s">the</a>  policies and rules that actually exist and are actually being followed or should be being followed, we're never gonna get on the same enough page to move forward in a collective way and really talk about having the community and collaborative conversations that we need to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7515.546s">So,</a>  you know, I know that that's the nicest way that I can think of to say what I really wanna say here. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7523.889s">But</a>  when we talk about unity, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7527.384s">we</a>  can't then have the next sentence be something that divides. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7531.907s">And</a>  I think, again, the thing that we can unify around here, maybe it's not the most heartwarming thing to unify around here, is that nobody is happy, there are problems, and we need to identify and move forward on solutions to those problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7550.619s">And</a>  I think if we can do that and accept a single set of facts about <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7555.855s">what</a>  is truly going on, then we are laying the foundation to have the substantive conversations and make the real actions that we need so that kids in our schools feel safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7567.958s">I</a>  know what it was like to not feel safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7570.519s">I</a>  stayed home for a whole week from school because I didn't want to get on the bus because I was attacked when I was in middle school, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7576.58s">And</a>  I'm not even equating that to what happened on Monday or what happened to other people, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7581.321s">I</a>  experienced that in my family. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7585.447s">So</a>  we can say that there's a monopoly on the feelings here, but we know what we know and we know that what we have to put forward is not sufficient at this moment to address the scope of the challenge that we face. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7605.271s">And</a>  I think the best thing that we can do is to look at the resolutions before us that are solutions focused and ask <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7612.94s">the</a>  people most affected the students and teachers on the ground to work with the school committee and the mayor and the school administration and the city council to figure out what we can do in the short term to address funding and what we can do in the long term to make a systemic solution and a systemic approach to make sure that <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7630.808s">we're</a>  addressing this issue in two weeks, in two months, in two years, and in two decades, because we heard last night that there were people who felt that 30 years ago to today, things hadn't been fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7643.395s">So</a>  that's all I wanna say on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7645.597s">Beyond</a>  that, I'm not gonna speak to this paper anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7648.258s">I'll</a>  speak to the solutions-focused resolutions that we have next, and I'll leave it at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7653.641s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7654.622s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7655.322s">Councilor</a>  Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7656.823s">Point</a>  of information, if I can, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7661.365s">the</a>  funding was there for the school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7664.446s">I</a>  believe it was probably 80% of the funding that was cut for security over the last four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7670.909s">So</a>  the funding was there and the school system cut that funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7674.271s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7675.692s">Councilor</a>  Tse.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7678.993s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7680.914s">I</a>  think it's important to thank first the teachers and the school staff and the parents who were there <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7689.918s">who</a>  are helping the students through the ordeal, who themselves had to deal with the emotional side of everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7699.084s">It's</a>  really important not to forget about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7703.967s">This</a>  hurts. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7705.048s">This</a>  hurts emotionally. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7706.669s">It</a>  hurts physically. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7710.972s">It's</a>  important to deal with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7712.873s">And</a>  it matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7714.054s">It</a>  matters to all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7715.154s">And</a>  look, everyone, everyone, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7719.613s">in</a>  this room, everyone online on Zoom is upset, is frustrated, is saddened. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7729.258s">And</a>  I think we all feel sympathy for the experience that our students have had to deal with and continue to have to deal with at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7743.526s">I</a>  will say I am relieved to hear <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7746.894s">that</a>  the student is in stable condition, but that doesn't mean that everything is over. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7756.496s">I</a>  really appreciate the talk from Councilors of all backgrounds about the importance of finding solutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7765.858s">And</a>  I think to that effect, I wanna thank President Morell and Vice President Bears for opening up the city council agenda to allow us to put resolutions on the agenda to have this conversation tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7776.74s">And</a>  to allow us to act fast and to allow us to have this conversation tonight to my parents in the room on in on zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7787.934s">Look,</a>  school violence, and I've said this before, and it's in the news, there's tons of research out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7794.979s">It's</a>  an international problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7797.26s">It's</a>  a domestic problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7798.441s">It's</a>  a Medford problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7800.783s">And</a>  that actually means that we have to deal with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7803.585s">And</a>  we do have to address it here at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7806.827s">School</a>  violence has been around for a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7811.19s">Councilor</a>  Bears has spoken to his experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7815.057s">I</a>  went to Medford High School just five years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7817.259s">I</a>  know what it's like there. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7821.221s">And</a>  it's a wonderful institution to learn. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7824.043s">There</a>  are blemishes on it as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7827.005s">And</a>  this work, these are all issues that school leaders, teachers, students, everyone has been working together to address over the last few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7839.514s">And</a>  it's evident that we need to put even more energy towards it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7843.757s">And</a>  as I've said before as well, until our schools are safe for everyone, for all, we still have more work to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7853.863s">We</a>  need to find sustainable solutions, and that means engaging stakeholders from students to parents to teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7860.826s">I</a>  know people aren't gonna like this, but the school committee who have been elected to govern our schools, to oversee our schools, and we need to engage school leaders as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7872.002s">We</a>  need to enforce the existing policies on violence and on anti-bullying. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7878.404s">And</a>  we need accountability to make sure that we're enforcing these policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7883.926s">We</a>  need to think through the actions that we can take to protect all kids carefully. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7894.155s">and</a>  quickly, I will add, but we need to make sure that they're equitable and reasonable and that they really truly do protect every kid in the classroom and in the hallways. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7904.141s">I</a>  think it's also evidence that there's a major communications problem that we as a city council have been bringing up in the city, the communications problem in the city when it comes to not just in an incident like this, but just in general, getting the message out to residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7923.288s">But</a>  when it comes to this incident as well, we need to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7929.393s">And</a>  I think President Morell and I have written a resolution to this effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7934.857s">We</a>  need to know about the incident. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7937.018s">We</a>  need to know the details. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7938.059s">We</a>  need to know authority and rules and who has authority over what. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7942.182s">And</a>  we need to prevent misinformation from being spread. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7946.909s">And</a>  school committee members at yesterday's meeting have also acknowledged that as a city, we need to do better on communications and on engaging families as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7959.3s">Councilor</a>  Bears is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7960.602s">The</a>  funding problem is real. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7962.003s">It's</a>  one of the reasons why I decided to run for office in the first place, watching the budget conversation years ago when <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7969.19s">We</a>  made major cuts to guidance and to mental health and counseling at our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7974.853s">And</a>  now we're seeing the effects of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7977.894s">We</a>  need to be serious about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7980.855s">We</a>  need to be serious about funding and to realize that there is a funding issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7985.978s">And</a>  that effect, that problem is trickling down to our hallways and to our classrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=7997.162s">and</a>  that particularly after COVID and after remote learning, there has been an epidemic of poor mental health in the city and in this country. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8008.07s">I</a>  asked the city and the city council joined me in passing a resolution months ago, asking the city to do a general survey on youth mental health and to look at the effects of that and to see what we can do to invest more in it and to prevent <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8025.504s">things</a>  like this from happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8027.847s">And</a>  it is upsetting as a Councilor to see that we haven't done enough on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8034.035s">This</a>  council has been responsible in doing that and we have been proactive in addressing youth mental health. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8041.518s">I</a>  want us to do as much as possible, as quickly as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8045.921s">I</a>  think that's something that everyone behind the reel would agree on. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8051.005s">But</a>  I also do wanna make sure that we are creating lasting solutions within our purview. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8056.449s">I</a>  know not everyone will agree with my approach on this issue and my ideas, but I am open-minded to hear more ideas, to hear feedback, both positive and negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8069.058s">And</a>  I understand, as Councilor Collins has mentioned, that many members of our community weren't able to make it to this meeting for scheduling reasons, for family reasons, and many members of our community aren't joining us today because they're afraid to talk and talking in public is not for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8089.628s">And</a>  to those people, my inbox and my voicemail box and my text message inbox is also open to everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8098.133s">I</a>  think it's really important to emphasize that regardless of the tone of this conversation, regardless of the points that people have brought up, regardless of the feedback that we're going to hear, and I think people in our community, there are many, many different ways of thinking about this issue and about the solutions for this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8116.64s">I</a>  think that's been evident to me in the conversations that I've had. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8120.777s">with</a>  neighbors, with residents, with young folks in the last 24 hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8125.919s">I</a>  think it's important to acknowledge the differences, but to also acknowledge the points of unity that I think we see on this agenda tonight, because those points of unity, those are the seeds, I think, for more lasting, more substantive policy changes in the future that will better, I think, create a school environment for our children.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8147.409s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8148.369s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8149.57s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8153.885s">trying</a>  to be restrained and understanding something very simple that I want to share with my fellow Councilors that gave their opinions.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8164.073s">Agree</a>  to disagree. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8165.574s">We've</a>  done that many times. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8171.279s">These</a>  are our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8173.401s">They're</a>  unsafe. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8174.902s">They're</a>  scared. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8176.803s">Our</a>  teachers are scared.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8181.206s">to</a>  talk about money concerns and money issues should not be even a thought right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8189.07s">The</a>  thought and the discussion of 30 years ago, five years ago, is an embarrassment to me for the fact that this is happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8199.415s">This</a>  is happening right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8204.757s">When</a>  I talk about unifying, I talk about what I said as a national agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8212.155s">we</a>  see and hear the direction that the school committee has gone on many different levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8221.161s">And</a>  some school committees, members have called me in the past and just didn't understand that they wouldn't fight if they didn't have their own voice, but to follow this national agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8235.15s">And</a>  as I'm seeing, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8236.975s">the</a>  people that I looked at and trusted and admired, I'm seeing that they're taking not what's important today in our schools, not what's important, our children, not their safety, but to be in this council chamber yesterday and listen to some of these people that truly are aligned with people in this room.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8261.989s">So</a>  these issues are concerning to the community to understand</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8267.397s">that</a>  we need to put that away. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8271.058s">Open</a>  our minds and be unified in the fact that the unification is needed for the safety of our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8278.439s">Not</a>  what happened five years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8280.82s">Not</a>  what happened 30 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8283.12s">What's</a>  happening today. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8284.121s">We're</a>  not gonna get the funding we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8287.721s">We</a>  know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8288.642s">And</a>  that's not gonna change. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8290.082s">So</a>  bringing that up right now is really sad to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8295.447s">That's</a>  just a buzzword and a check off. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8299.909s">So</a>  I will tell you, we need movement now. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8304.531s">We</a>  need our school committee, our superintendent to move now. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8309.213s">I</a>  wanna see action now. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8314.215s">Let's</a>  stop, let's hold school off for the next four days, three days. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8317.596s">Let's</a>  bring our teachers into a room with our principals and let's find a solution right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8323.462s">So</a>  our kids are safe when it's time to go back to school.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8327.426s">Because</a>  the next few days are going to be useless. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8331.17s">There's</a>  going to be no learning.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8334.474s">I</a>  want to get solutions from groups that are going to work together to make our kids safe on January 3rd. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8342.001s">Safe</a>  when they go back to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8346.058s">So</a>  to protect each other because what was said in another forum and how it was presented by this Councilor to people on different committees and try to protect what they're doing on the school committee side, I'm not afraid to speak for it.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8362.209s">Politically,</a>  I don't care. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8364.031s">Our</a>  kids are hurting and what people are seeing</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_27]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8372.245s">And</a>  what they're hearing from the school committee are gender items that aren't protecting or looking at their safety.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8381.667s">I</a>  was questioned that I was part of that school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8385.008s">And</a>  there are legalities.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8387.609s">And</a>  I understood those legalities. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8390.129s">But</a>  you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8391.249s">When</a>  it came to children's safety, George Scarpelli never swayed. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8395.35s">I</a>  made sure that they were safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8398.151s">I</a>  never had this situation when I was on the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8401.392s">Thank</a>  God. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8404.102s">But</a>  I will tell you, we can bicker back and forth and disagree, but ultimately, that wasn't my intention today. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8413.927s">My</a>  intention is truly look at everybody and say, let's meet now. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8418.33s">Let's</a>  bring everybody together now. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8420.231s">Let's</a>  set a plan that's tangible that we can reach, that we're not gonna get grants from the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8425.934s">We're</a>  not gonna get funding from City Hall, but there's ways to get that done right now to make our children feel safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8434.915s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8440.837s">Any</a>  further discussion from the council at this time?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8443.317s">Madam</a>  President, if I may.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8444.458s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8445.618s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8446.278s">You</a>  know, there's no such thing as a utopian society. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8456.341s">And</a>  I don't think in this instance that throwing money at an issue, and quite frankly, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8463.997s">given</a>  the decision makers who aren't allocating funds properly in the first place, more money to spend. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8470.698s">I</a>  don't think this is going to do anything for those children that need to go to school tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8477.4s">It</a>  might help in the long run, but it's not going to do anything for those children that need to go to school tomorrow.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8486.302s">What</a>  this is about is reallocation.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8491.883s">As</a>  of right now, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8493.762s">The</a>  committee needs to live within its means because there is no funding request from the mayor before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8499.767s">So</a>  we can jump up and down and say, we want more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8501.648s">We</a>  want more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8502.209s">We</a>  do that every week about every issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8504.67s">But</a>  ultimately right now, the administration hasn't put the paper before this body, which tells me the administration isn't taking it seriously, which would again, move me to the position to say, you have to live within your means and reallocate your funds then to address this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8519.502s">So</a>  what's the plan and what are you going to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8522.013s">And</a>  why are our kids going back to school tomorrow if you don't have a plan and you don't know what you're gonna do? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8528.295s">Quite</a>  frankly, I think the school should have been shut down until after Christmas vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8532.637s">Blanket,</a>  sorry, high school's closed until after Christmas vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8536.559s">In</a>  the interest of safety, in the interest of us showing this community that we're serious about the issues that are before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8542.541s">Because</a>  a year has gone by and we haven't showed that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8548.803s">So,</a>  you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8551.198s">Certainly</a>  someone that recognizes that there's a need for resources, but I also think that there is room for reallocation of existing funds, existing policies, and existing practices that will improve the safety in our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8571.169s">Reversing</a>  some of the policy decisions that were made over the last year is a good start. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8579.348s">But</a>  again, there's no such thing as a utopian society and there's never going to be enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8584.51s">How</a>  much is enough? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8586.111s">There's</a>  never going to be enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8587.691s">There's</a>  never, we're never going to reach a point where we say, Oh, we're cool. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8590.052s">This</a>  is good. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8590.753s">This</a>  is enough money for us to do whatever we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8593.274s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8593.614s">That</a>  doesn't happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8595.435s">That</a>  doesn't happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8596.255s">Nobody</a>  says, I want to make less money next year than I made this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8599.536s">That's</a>  just not the way it works. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8601.417s">So,</a>  you know, we can keep throwing money at issues or we can say, where are you allocating this money? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8605.639s">And</a>  is this a good plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8607.125s">Because</a>  throwing money at issues doesn't do anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8608.866s">It's</a>  not going to fix the problem if we're not spending it in the right place. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8611.527s">And</a>  it's clear that the money we've already provided isn't being spent in the right place. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8615.449s">So</a>  maybe it comes down to a reallocation plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8617.63s">And</a>  then what can we do to supplement that reallocation plan, but let them live with the existing means that they have? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8622.292s">Because</a>  quite frankly, it seems like every time something comes up, they just, anything in this community, quite frankly, anytime anything comes up, it's, we don't have any money. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8629.755s">We</a>  don't have any money to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8630.756s">We</a>  don't have any money to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8632.882s">All</a>  right, well, if you don't have any money to do it and it needs to get done, then what's the next thing you got to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8636.485s">You</a>  got to reallocate. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8638.567s">You</a>  got to change your game plan up a little bit there, folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8640.349s">You</a>  know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8641.45s">It's</a>  like Belichick at halftime, you know, change the game plan, win the game. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8645.173s">We're</a>  not changing the game plan at halftime. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8647.515s">We're</a>  not taking a real strong self-assessment as to where we stand and then making adjustments to improve our position.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8660.79s">I'll</a>  be short, the game is rigged. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8665.491s">We</a>  can try to change our game plan as much as we want. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8668.212s">But</a>  when we're talking about city departments and city budgets that in real inflation adjusted dollar terms have less money now than they did in 1980, the game is rigged. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8677.114s">So</a>  that's the first thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8678.095s">I'm</a>  not disputing that there are things we could do immediately to bring people together and try to find solutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8685.977s">I</a>  think that's exactly what we have on here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8688.499s">There</a>  are things we could do with short money that could make a big impact and make people feel safer. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8692.56s">And</a>  I think that's what we're asking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8694.401s">But</a>  I think the idea that we can fix this whole problem, or that the notion of putting more resources, this is just throwing money at the problem, that we can address a problem that has been persistent, that is growing in scale, that is not just unique to Medford, even though we could do what we can in Medford to find unique solutions with what we have through reallocation and additional resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8715.175s">it's</a>  promising something that's unachievable. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8718.838s">So</a>  I agree, let's do what we can now with short money or no money at all to make people feel safer in the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8724.681s">I</a>  completely understand and respect that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8727.182s">And</a>  I think we have to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8729.043s">But</a>  if we're not, again, if we're not thinking about this in a bigger terms of, you know, when we talk about resources, yeah, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8737.22s">make</a>  people feel safer, I would bet to have some additional resources around the hallways and the bathrooms, because that's clearly been a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8743.322s">It</a>  was a problem that came up before what happened yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8746.543s">Obviously</a>  it was a problem yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8747.964s">That's</a>  something that'll make people feel safer. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8750.004s">And</a>  we can figure out ways to target resources to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8753.525s">But</a>  when we talk about students' mental health and the mental health crisis and the fact that we need dozens of more Councilors at our school, or we need to bring back maybe an assistant principal at the high school, or we have to look at the funding cuts that were made in 2020, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8767.582s">or</a>  2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8769.842s">Those</a>  are big ticket items that, you know, if we just want to say we'll never get there, then all we're going to do is the short money things that make people feel a little bit safer until they don't work anymore, or until more kids are facing issues with mental health and conflict resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8786.506s">I'm</a>  going to stop there, because I don't think it's mutually exclusive. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8789.947s">I'm</a>  not saying we can only do one piece of it and not the other and I don't think anyone else is saying the other way around. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8796.387s">If</a>  we don't have that conversation and admit that, we're not going to be operating on a set of facts and under the urgency that we need to be operating under to bring the solutions to bear that we obviously all agree need to be brought to bear.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8812.956s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8814.357s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8816.498s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8817.518s">And</a>  I'm speaking off the cuff here. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8819.72s">So</a>  I just wanna say, I think that what the community deserves <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8825.088s">today</a>  in the aftermath of yesterday's events, in the aftermath of other traumatic, tragic events. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8831.45s">What</a>  the community deserves is a communicative, collaborative city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8840.752s">They</a>  deserve clear communication, resolve to work together productively from all their elected leaders. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8848.714s">We</a>  owe our community better than infighting. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8851.234s">You</a>  know, we've disagreed on many things many times before, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8855.258s">Behind</a>  this rail, it'll happen again. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8858.139s">That's</a>  what we're here to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8860.2s">We're</a>  here to represent different viewpoints for perspective on issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8863.841s">We're</a>  here to represent different viewpoints for how to craft strategy and how to respond to problems in our community and how to plan for the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8871.964s">But</a>  I think that we owe today, especially today and all days, we owe the community a productive use of our time, discussing available strategies for what we can do within our powers <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8884.502s">to</a>  try to deal with the problems before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8887.364s">I,</a>  you know, what, what looks like a buzzword to one Councilor might be somebody else's best good faith, earnest approach at doing something that is within our power, within our purview to try to address specifically a problem that exists. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8906.596s">It's</a>  put forth in good faith. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8907.897s">And</a>  I think that tracks both ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8909.358s">I</a>  don't think it's productive for us to launch into <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8915.19s">veiled</a>  personal attacks. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8918.232s">I</a>  don't want that to be what tonight is. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8919.833s">I</a>  think that we have to come together. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8921.715s">We</a>  have to discuss the strategies that we've put forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8924.236s">We</a>  might not agree on all of them, but what our community is calling out for is a good faith, earnest discussion of strategies. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8931.241s">It</a>  does our community no good to spill a lot of ink and spill a lot of airtime, fighting about things that we cannot control. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8941.749s">The</a>  community deserves better than a performance. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8944.091s">we</a>  need to discuss strategies that we have the capacity to enforce. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8947.973s">And</a>  sometimes we will disagree about what those best strategies are, but that's what our time should be for. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8952.536s">So</a>  I have a rationale for why I brought the strategies that I think are most important to talk about here. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8958.539s">I</a>  know those feelings aren't universally shared. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8960.72s">I'll</a>  save that for when those papers are brought up, but I really hope that we can maintain just <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8966.579s">clear</a>  communication and sticking to the issues at hand and striving for concrete strategies for as much of this evening as possible, because that's what the community needs from us. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8974.284s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8974.584s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8976.765s">And</a>  I do believe the intent of the resolution is to open it up for public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8980.527s">So</a>  I want to see if there's any further discussion from the council, but I want to make sure <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8984.082s">we</a>  move forward to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8985.682s">Seeing</a>  none, I just want to just briefly, Councilor Scarpelli, I absolutely hear your calls for unity. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8990.744s">I</a>  hear everyone's calls for unity. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8992.064s">And</a>  I believe that the council is absolutely unified and that no one wanted yesterday to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8998.966s">No</a>  one wanted the incident two months ago to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9001.427s">No</a>  one wanted any student to get hurt in our schools ever. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9005.848s">Schools</a>  should be a refuge. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9007.108s">We</a>  talk about a lot of these issues go beyond the schools, that a lot of these issues start at home because of course they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9013.208s">but</a>  every student deserves the opportunity to go to school and feel safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9017.87s">And</a>  I know every member of this council, every person in the chambers, every person on Zoom, I know they feel that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9024.373s">So</a>  I hope that we can continue to have this talk and come to solutions so that students can feel safe, so that parents can feel comfortable sending their kids to school, and so that teachers can have the space to do their jobs and do what they do best. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9039.519s">So</a>  I'm going to open it up to public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9042.001s">Before</a>  we go to that, I do just want to note public participation is just that, it is to hear from the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9046.464s">It</a>  is not meant to be a debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9048.805s">No</a>  personal tax will be permitted. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9051.647s">I</a>  will gavel them and no speculation that will further engage your students will be allowed either.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9057.331s">So</a>  opening it up.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9064.376s">Seeing</a>  Madam Superintendent and Member McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9069.721s">Madam</a>  President and council members. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9073.043s">I</a>  am Marice Edouard-Vincent, superintendent of schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9075.725s">I</a>  am here this evening to first represent the district and to say that the incident that took place yesterday is not something that we want to see repeated ever again in the Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9091.635s">I</a>  don't endorse or support any kind of weapons coming into the school that is not the Medford Public Schools <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9098.947s">that</a>  I am here representing. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9100.568s">So</a>  what happened yesterday was a terrible, terrible incident. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9104.932s">It</a>  was not something that we knew was going to happen in advance. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9108.736s">And</a>  working with communications to get that message out and trying to keep the entire community safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9114.981s">Working</a>  collaboratively with the police, we had <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9117.855s">many,</a>  many police officers on campus yesterday, and there was a lot of investigating happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9123.398s">There</a>  was a lot of information that as things were unfolding, we had to wait for more information to become available. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9131.723s">So</a>  I know that we had two medical emergencies yesterday, one earlier in the morning, which was a separate event, and then the second event that took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9142.108s">And</a>  that incident and all students that were involved <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9146.105s">a</a>  significant number of students. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9148.926s">Again,</a>  looking at the video cameras and figuring out how many people were actually involved, it's a significant number. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9156.33s">We</a>  had plenty of police support today. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9158.971s">We</a>  also had fire support in the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9162.093s">Our</a>  fire personnel, additional administrators were at the high school, teachers, staff, everyone, it was all hands on deck working together to keep the community safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9173.732s">We</a>  did have a higher absentee rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9176.554s">It</a>  wasn't 400 students, but we were in the high 200s today. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9180.996s">Normally</a>  we hover around 10% in terms of absence. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9187.059s">I</a>  am here today to just say that we are doing everything that we can do to address the situation that happened based on the students that are involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9196.764s">And</a>  because of the nature of yesterday's incident, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9200.841s">The</a>  police again are continuing their investigation at MPD and we are working collaboratively because it is an ongoing investigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9210.226s">And</a>  again, it was a significant number of students that were involved, others that were just bystanders. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9215.93s">And</a>  so that's the reason why there's been limited information because it's still an active, very active situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9226.556s">I</a>  do also want to report that we did have the opportunity <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9230.422s">speak</a>  with the family today and with the student on campus. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9236.666s">And</a>  we are continuing to pray for his speedy recovery, but we are in communication and we are working collaboratively with the family as well.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9251.315s">My</a>  understanding that the student was relatively new student in the school transfer student. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9255.038s">That's</a>  my understanding.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9257.469s">It</a>  is a vocational student in one of our programs.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9261.212s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9261.612s">And</a>  do you feel as though this might be related to a bullying incident or something like that, an underlying bullying incident? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9267.056s">What</a>  was the basis of the argument, the series of events or event that gave cause to arise to such an action?</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9275.841s">So</a>  again, that action was surprising to everyone based on some of what's been shown on some of the video footage. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9285.728s">We're</a>  not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9288.2s">There</a>  were comments about other interactions happening at other times. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9293.482s">Since</a>  it is an active investigation, I have to be, I'm not able to say too much, but what I can say is it's an active investigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9304.425s">The</a>  police are deeply involved and any situation involving weapons, which are not allowed in schools, discipline is being meted out. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9316.295s">according</a>  to what is said in the law regarding any kind of weapon. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9320.996s">So</a>  I do want to say that it's not being taken lightly, it's being addressed appropriately. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9326.838s">And</a>  because of FERPA, I still need to be careful with what is said publicly on the floor, but what I can assure this body and the community that is listening is that it is being addressed and we are making sure that we have all of the individuals <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9343.387s">that</a>  were involved or were bystanders.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9348.668s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9349.868s">Could</a>  the student that stabbed the other student actually be let back into school? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9354.369s">Not</a>  according to the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9356.69s">Is</a>  it the intention of the school administration to expel that student?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9364.871s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9365.171s">I'm</a>  asking if the kid's getting expelled.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9368.472s">May</a>  I? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9370.038s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9371.158s">I'm</a>  Melanie McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9372.959s">I'm</a>  a school committee member. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9373.879s">I'm</a>  also a parent of three, two Medford high school graduates, one current Medford public school student. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9380.281s">I've</a>  lived in Medford for 23 years and I'm here tonight specifically because I want to support the superintendent in her role and because I want to support the school committee and the parents and families and students in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9393.906s">We're</a>  all heartbroken about what has happened to our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9397.913s">or</a>  the past few months, but it has not been just the past few months. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9401.414s">And</a>  there are plenty of people in the community that know that and that understand that it has been years. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9406.356s">We've</a>  had a bullying problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9407.556s">Most</a>  high schools have bullying problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9409.197s">There's</a>  a rise in violence. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9411.277s">It's</a>  national. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9412.038s">You</a>  can see it all over the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9413.818s">It</a>  is happening, particularly because of pandemic, but also because of the politicized nature <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9419.162s">of</a>  the hatred that exists in communities between polarized sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9423.865s">And</a>  our children are often mimicking what they're seeing their adults do. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9427.447s">And</a>  what I think is really important is what we've heard from city council members who are talking about finding solutions to work together, to collaborate, to change systems for all of our children, not some of our children, all of our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9439.053s">This</a>  has been ongoing. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9439.873s">We're</a>  talking about not just the past four years of this administration, meaning this particular superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9445.316s">This</a>  has been an ongoing problem from when other people were on school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9448.58s">from</a>  when people have been around for some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9450.381s">I</a>  want to clarify for the community and for city Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9454.902s">I'm</a>  not afraid of being yelled at. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9457.203s">I</a>  just don't like it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9458.443s">I</a>  think it's inappropriate and unprofessional. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9461.244s">And</a>  when we talk about bullying in our community, I have never seen more of an example of bullying in our community that I see in the city council chambers every single week. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9471.951s">And</a>  I think that everybody in the community would agree with that.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9474.513s">Point</a>  of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9475.494s">There's</a>  a difference between bullying and passion. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9478.277s">And</a>  that's what you lack, ma'am. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9479.938s">You</a>  lack the passion.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9483.121s">I</a>  think we both know each other well, George. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9484.942s">We're</a>  all neighbors here. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9485.843s">We</a>  all know each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9487.184s">We</a>  all know each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9488.446s">Our</a>  children play together.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9490.087s">If</a>  you could please continue through the chair.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9493.21s">Great</a>  choice of support. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9499.887s">So</a>  the ongoing bullying is inappropriate and is what our children are seeing. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9503.668s">And</a>  that's what I would like to specifically point out. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9505.969s">We</a>  wanna figure out how to work, should collaborate together to change outcomes for all children. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9511.83s">And</a>  I'm not gonna be shamed, I'm not gonna be blamed and I'm not gonna be named and neither should any of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9517.011s">And</a>  I would ask that our city council members across the board and that our community across the board stand up to bullies everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9524.033s">And</a>  we make sure that this stops in our community and in our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9528.138s">And</a>  I'm here to do that, and I'm here to roll up my sleeves and help make sure that that happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9531.56s">And</a>  I think we all should be doing that.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9534.181s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9535.642s">Point</a>  of information, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9538.744s">Madam</a>  Superintendent, yesterday a young man came to the podium and addressed the situation that happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9546.628s">Did</a>  you hear the young man who described a very similar situation just a few weeks prior? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9552.872s">I</a>  asked the superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9554.293s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9557.078s">Was</a>  that addressed today? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9558.459s">Did</a>  you contact the guidance Councilor that he talked to, to express the concern of the same people threatening him to stab him? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9568.543s">Did</a>  you address that today?</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9571.484s">That</a>  specific comment that was made yesterday, it's still being under investigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9577.806s">And</a>  there's another, there are other things that have come forward, which are also being fully investigated.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9588.257s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9589.958s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9592.86s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9596.642s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9597.883s">Madam</a>  Superintendent, I have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9601.845s">What</a>  I'm a little concerned about what I'm seeing now is these are looking like staged events. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9607.529s">These</a>  are kids standing there waiting for this to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9611.571s">And</a>  that upsets me most. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9614.273s">I</a>  mean, I saw the video, this one, another one says, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9618.925s">and</a>  kids are standing there with the cameras, like this is a TV show production waiting to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9624.95s">Everyone's</a>  got a camera.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9626.371s">Why</a>  aren't those kids being suspended too? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9629.273s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello, I agree exactly with what you're saying right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9635.698s">The</a>  professional videographers, events that are taking place where it appears to be staged, we are having very similar conversations with the police. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9646.345s">All</a>  of the individuals that were involved in yesterday's event, based on what we could see from the video footage, they are all being addressed, including the bystanders. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9659.208s">So</a>  all of the individuals that we've been able to identify, discipline is being meted out. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9667.33s">Discipline</a>  is being meted out at the district level. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9670.891s">So</a>  again, students videotaping it, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9673.556s">students</a>  that are just watching their bystanders.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9675.818s">Let</a>  them go to the TV station and put their skills at our TV station at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9682.062s">It</a>  is, I mean, the challenges that we're facing. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9684.223s">Not</a>  saying they're waiting for fights to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9687.045s">That</a>  really upsets me when I see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9688.586s">I'm</a>  not saying that's your fault, but that upsets me when there's a whole bunch of kids waiting, because they all knew that this was going to happen.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9697.032s">The</a>  social media piece of it is very upsetting. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9703.182s">another</a>  challenge that didn't exist 12 years ago.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9708.605s">Social</a>  media is a challenge. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9710.806s">Social</a>  media is truly a challenge.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9712.527s">It's</a>  a huge challenge, especially for bullying, especially for videos being distributed, for videos being given to the news media, for information being shared, for people politicizing situation is terrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9723.173s">And</a>  the children are the social media piece of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9726.415s">The</a>  bullying element on social media is compounded exponentially. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9731.38s">So</a>  when we talk about resources that we need, we need resources to help support our children's mental health.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9736.203s">It</a>  is a mental health crisis right now because of what people are dealing with on a daily. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9743.248s">Was</a>  there a drug overdose?</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9747.812s">I</a>  don't, I just know that there was a medical emergency earlier in the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9757.258s">I</a>  was not told that there was a drug overdose. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9761.856s">You</a>  did say that the police and the fire department were there today? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9764.678s">Yes,</a>  providing additional support. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9766.6s">What</a>  kind of support? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9768.481s">They</a>  were supporting in the hallways. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9770.062s">They</a>  were just available and also conducting the investigation as additional students' names became available that did not appear on some of the videos. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9780.769s">So</a>  they've been providing additional support in conducting their official investigation.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9786.093s">So</a>  they weren't there in a security capacity?</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9790.595s">I</a>  would say both. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9792.076s">They</a>  were present. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9792.957s">They</a>  were present in hallways, but they were also conducting the investigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9801.604s">We</a>  probably had maybe six. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9803.886s">Maybe</a>  there were six police officers there providing support. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9807.809s">I'm</a>  not sure of the final number today.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9810.511s">And</a>  I mean, I understand that, you know, violence happens in schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9816.736s">Most</a>  high schools aren't on the news every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9819.359s">as</a>  this as is on the news every day surrounding communities on the news every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9824.762s">All</a>  right, and don't make this about the Medford City Council gets passionate about issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9828.204s">So</a>  it's our fault that kids get stabbed in high school because that's nonsense. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9830.845s">All</a>  right, because we don't make the policies up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9832.746s">All</a>  right, the school committee does they're the ones that set the policies.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9835.667s">They're</a>  the ones that are responsible, but nobody is making policies for students to get injured. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9841.31s">So</a>  there were bigger issues that I want to go to the bathroom.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9844.432s">Why</a>  is it 12 kids hanging on the bathroom?</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9845.852s">Can</a>  I can I may I please? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9848.814s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9850.116s">So</a>  this is what we're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9851.517s">This</a>  is the barraging. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9852.658s">This</a>  is the sort of, you know, back and forth with people trying to intimidate people. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9856.121s">I</a>  think it's really important.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9857.202s">I'm</a>  not trying to hold you accountable for the words you just said. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9859.644s">I</a>  have the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9860.785s">You</a>  don't have a point of information because you're not a Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9863.047s">Let</a>  me know when you're finished.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9865.609s">I'm</a>  finished, Madam President, because this is like ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9868.932s">This</a>  is ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9869.613s">So</a>  what's the plan going forward tomorrow when these kids go back to school, how are they going to be safer than they were yesterday? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9877.539s">Let's</a>  answer that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9878.791s">because</a>  that's really what the people care about.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9880.131s">May</a>  I? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9883.812s">Yes,</a>  for one moment, if you don't mind to pretend, is that okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9890.054s">I'm</a>  not answering your question. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9891.374s">May</a>  I? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9892.415s">To</a>  the chair? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9893.995s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9894.315s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9895.195s">So</a>  I just wanted to say that to Councilor Tseng and Councilor Collins remarks earlier about people who are intimidated to come up to this podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9905.888s">and</a>  who are not able to speak for a number of reasons publicly to please feel free to reach out for solution oriented options because we are willing and open to listen to community members. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9915.434s">This</a>  is a community problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9916.895s">This</a>  is not seven people that are going to solve a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9918.856s">It's</a>  not one person that's going to solve a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9920.778s">This</a>  is a community systemic problem and it's a national problem and we need all hands working together. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9926.281s">We</a>  don't need people yelling at people. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9927.742s">We</a>  need people collaborating.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9929.479s">And</a>  I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9930.399s">And</a>  to all those people listening, when you go to the school committee, remember that.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9934.421s">I</a>  just wanted to respond to your comment, Councilor Knight, regarding what is the high school doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9940.883s">We</a>  have additional social emotional supports at the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9944.404s">We</a>  had outside support available as well at the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9947.825s">We</a>  had additional police presence and we redeployed several of our administrators who were also present at the high school today. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9956.088s">So</a>  there were, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9958.346s">There</a>  was an abundance of administrators, staff, police presence, fire presence, additional Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9966.932s">We</a>  were all hands on deck working collaboratively to keep everything running smoothly at the high school today. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9973.617s">And</a>  we had a very quiet day today.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9978.497s">but</a>  I just have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9979.417s">How</a>  many of those administrators and other individuals that were deployed in the hallways that trained in safety training, trained in how to keep somebody safe?</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9985.719s">How</a>  many?</p>

    <p>[Samantha Ripley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9989.199s">I</a>  don't know, you keep piping in too, so I'm trying to figure that out.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9994.02s">Everybody's</a>  interrupting each other, so maybe you should stop that.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9998.601s">So</a>  all the administrators that are there are providing additional support and supervision in the hallways <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10006.848s">during</a>  passing, during transition times for the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10010.969s">So</a>  that was part of what took place today because students did express that they did not feel safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10016.59s">There</a>  was a lot of extra presence and extra support today and extra counseling support. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10021.851s">All</a>  of that is going to be available for the entire week. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10025.671s">We</a>  are there to meet the needs of our students, the staff and teachers, many of them were also on duty. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10032.852s">They</a>  volunteered and they were providing additional <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10036.281s">support</a>  and supervision in the hallways today and things were, it was a quiet day today. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10043.526s">So</a>  we were very happy that it was a productive day for the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10047.87s">We</a>  know that it's going to take time and that's why we do also have the additional counseling support available for any student and staff that require that.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10059.238s">I'm</a>  a little bit less concerned about the counseling of the traumatized bodies and I'm a little bit more concerned about how we're going to keep bodies safe <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10070.624s">on</a>  that, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10071.684s">These</a>  events are happening over and over again.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10073.926s">They</a>  are not happening over and over again.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10075.787s">Two</a>  major events in the last 60 days.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10078.409s">But</a>  that is not over and over again.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10080.391s">It's</a>  not isolated.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10081.512s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli has a point of information.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10084.134s">Would</a>  it be shocking, Madam Superintendent, that a few phone calls I did receive from personnel that were there to support that there were still numerous students walking the halls freely? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10100.35s">Has</a>  that even been addressed?</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10102.492s">I</a>  have been, I was in the hallways today as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10104.894s">So</a>  I don't know exactly what point in time that was. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10107.736s">Students</a>  were allowed to go between, some students maybe needed a break. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10114.082s">I'm</a>  not sure the information that you're receiving because that's not the information that I saw firsthand today. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10120.327s">And</a>  I was with the administration, Principal DeLava, Principal Fallon, the assistant principals, we were together today. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10128.107s">And</a>  there was significant, significant adult presence in all of the hallways, including additional teachers and staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10136.281s">So</a>  that's not the experience that I saw today at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10140.488s">Okay,</a>  that's good to hear.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10142.059s">As</a>  you approach the re-entry and starting the new year off, I would really hope, from what I've heard from the kids, is that your administration, yourself personally, bring the student body together so they can understand what's going on because they're lost. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10159.935s">Over</a>  the last incident that happened, they were waiting for some sort of <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10164.872s">acknowledgement</a>  of something and to keep them feeling safe, that was not done. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10172.918s">I</a>  hope moving forward on the third, that the student body is in one area that they can see the leadership of our school system to show them that we're there and we understand what we're trying to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10186.788s">That</a>  hasn't been done yet.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10188.049s">Okay,</a>  so what you're talking about, we are working on meeting with the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10192.232s">We</a>  would not meet with all 1300 students <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10195.312s">at</a>  one time because it's just too large a number. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10198.293s">So</a>  we have already been planning to meet with the students by grade level teams and in smaller groups of hundreds so that it's a more manageable number and that students will have an opportunity to speak back. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10211.415s">So</a>  we are actively working on that as a team. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10214.976s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10228.218s">Every</a>  time I come to these meetings, I say, I'm not gonna speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10230.678s">And</a>  then I listen to what everybody has to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10233.619s">And</a>  I take a lot of notes and everybody here makes it pretty easy for me to end up being the, maybe the calm voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10242.941s">Maybe</a>  that everybody needs to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10244.261s">Maybe</a>  it's the parents and the kids at home that need to hear my voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10247.362s">Maybe</a>  it's you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10249.982s">I</a>  hope I'm not just hearing myself at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10253.146s">but</a>  a lot of things have been said. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10254.487s">I</a>  heard the superintendent say that all hands were on deck. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10263.494s">We</a>  need that every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10265.376s">We</a>  need all hands on deck every single day for these children.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10274.603s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli quoted our daughter and our community really has seemed to rally around step up</p>

    <p>[Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10283.432s">or</a>  step down. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10286.074s">But</a>  there was something else that our daughter said yesterday that impressed me. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10292.879s">And</a>  this morning I sent an email to her teachers and she said, if it weren't for my amazing teachers and my amazing vocational program, I would transfer, I would leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10310.872s">I</a>  think that says a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10312.859s">about</a>  our staff, about our teachers, about her friends who are dealing with this at her age, right along with her, with their families who have stood by our side. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10326.785s">It's</a>  very impressive to me that the teachers were the ones that were with our kids today. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10335.989s">They</a>  were the ones that were with our children during that lockdown yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10340.652s">As</a>  upset as my daughter was, her teacher took care of her yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10346.375s">Her</a>  teacher saved her life on October 17th.</p>

    <p>[Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10712.768s">I</a>  feel like I've known her for a very long time, even though we've just met yesterday outside of Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10719.311s">This</a>  is not <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10722.095s">a</a>  bond moms should have while their daughters are in high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10727.697s">This</a>  is not the bond that we should be making. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10730.858s">And</a>  I'm grateful for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10733.339s">But</a>  this is a sad time. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10735.72s">It</a>  really is a sad time. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10737.18s">We</a>  need to step up. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10739.181s">We</a>  need to work together, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10741.822s">I've</a>  asked, and I almost messaged the school committee today and said, let me help. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10748.288s">let</a>  me help. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10749.049s">I'll</a>  come to I've been at every meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10751.11s">I've</a>  been here. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10751.911s">I'll</a>  do it all. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10752.591s">I'll</a>  do it all. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10753.792s">Just</a>  tell me. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10754.653s">I</a>  think you all know how persistent I am at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10757.555s">I'm</a>  not going away. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10758.536s">I</a>  love this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10759.917s">I</a>  love I believe the blue and white too. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10763.58s">I</a>  believe it too. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10764.741s">And</a>  I and I want to be proud and I always have been I'm so proud that the football team was here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10769.905s">I</a>  we need to we need to recognize all the good that's happening here starting with the teachers, the sports <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10777.405s">the</a>  culinary program, the vocational school, all of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10780.926s">It</a>  needs to be celebrated, but we can't let this other stuff go be swept under the rug anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10786.847s">So</a>  thank you again for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10788.408s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10793.069s">She's</a>  a little nervous. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10793.929s">She</a>  asked me if I would stand with her. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10795.51s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10795.77s">And</a>  I just wanna, just cause there's, we'll take the two people standing in person and then I'll go to Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10799.791s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10801.151s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Samantha Ripley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10802.871s">My</a>  name is Samantha Ripley and I live on Kenmare Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10806.477s">We</a>  all know what has been going on at the high school for a few months now, and it's gotten to the point where we had a stabbing yesterday morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10813.38s">Many</a>  of the students I know are afraid to go to school because this has gotten too far. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10817.381s">I</a>  personally haven't had to experience many problems at this school, but my friends have. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10822.163s">I</a>  wanted to speak out tonight in hopes my voice will be heard on the issues going on at the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10826.645s">As</a>  a student who actively has to get up each morning into that building, I wonder what <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10831.903s">and</a>  walk into that building and wonder what can possibly happen next. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10835.164s">As</a>  a senior about to finish and graduate from this high school, I'm ashamed to be graduating from Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10840.327s">I</a>  did not attend the school my freshman year as I went to Malton Catholic, but this past year has left me questioning why I left with all the violence that is going on and the fact that a plan hasn't been placed into action to stop the violence. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10852.532s">When</a>  I first came to Medford High, I was extremely excited because I had the opportunity to be a part of the vocational program. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10858.708s">But</a>  lately, I haven't been feeling safe at a place many of us call our second home. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10863.371s">We</a>  are tired and frustrating of having to enter the halls of Medford High, wondering what will occur today. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10868.654s">Why</a>  aren't the voices of students and teachers who are being affected being heard? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10872.796s">We</a>  are in that building for six hours plus a day, five days a week, and our voices aren't being heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10878.28s">Well,</a>  we are the ones who have to witness incidents occur on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10882.522s">What</a>  more has to be done for something <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10884.48s">What</a>  more has to happen for something to be done? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10886.801s">It</a>  has gotten to a point where students and parents are now concerned about safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10891.024s">All</a>  we want to know is what we will, what steps will, sorry, all we want to know is what will be the next steps to help the school become a safer environment that an incident like this will not happen again. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10902.691s">The</a>  school should have been placed <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10904.575s">I</a>  should have placed a disciplinary action as soon as we got back into the building during the hybrid schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10909.877s">All</a>  the student wants is to be able to feel safe and know they have the right guidance from the faculty who are supposed to be leading us into this adult life. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10917.721s">The</a>  fact that after three plus hours on lockdown, we had a fire alarm go off and many students were anxious and scared and just wanting to leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10926.385s">My</a>  anxiety was so high yesterday that once the fire alarm went off, my history teacher from last year had to help me calm down because I was crying. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10934.399s">All</a>  because of the staff we have to guide us, do not know how to handle such situations because of the lack of resources given. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10942.644s">I</a>  shouldn't have to be worrying about my safety for myself and my friends while at a place that is supposed to protect us. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10948.348s">I</a>  should be excited for the next few months as graduation is coming up, but instead I'm expressing my concerns on the safety for everyone at MHS. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10955.872s">There</a>  needs to be more interaction between staff and students. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10959.074s">The</a>  lack of trust and support that students have from faculty <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10962.192s">to</a>  express concern is unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10964.994s">The</a>  students should have something to look forward to and not having to worry about if we will be the next victim. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10970.898s">This</a>  is a huge problem that we as the students not fail. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10974.12s">We</a>  have the support from many faculty and staff members in the building, the building we spend most of our time out of our day in. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10984.287s">We</a>  all just want actions with solutions to be placed into a system to help our anxiety and to be able <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10989.658s">to</a>  feel safe at school so we can get the proper education we deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10993.279s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Copran]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10998.099s">Okay,</a>  well, I'll stay with everybody's the popular one. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11006.621s">So</a>  good evening, my name is Joanne. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11009.821s">My</a>  daughter is a sophomore at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11013.042s">She's</a>  also in the vocational program. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11015.682s">My</a>  daughter has goals and dreams like most of <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11020.236s">your</a>  children, if you have children, she wants to be a trauma surgeon. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11023.998s">She</a>  wants to reach that goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11025.478s">I</a>  expect her to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11030.26s">I</a>  never thought I'd be here discussing this, but bullying, it's a real thing in the school, outside of school as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11040.764s">I</a>  have an only child, and <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11047.202s">The</a>  police reports that I obtained, because you need three, I have probably 10 just from this school year, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11057.652s">So</a>  this one was from April, but this was a continuation from last year, but this was April of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11065.098s">It's</a>  quite a few pages long. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11066.84s">This</a>  incident, my daughter was in her classroom doing her work, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11074.276s">And</a>  a group of girls barged into her classroom, went right up to her while she was sitting at her desk and antagonized her to start a fight. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11086.284s">She</a>  kept her hands to herself. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11088.346s">We</a>  would be having a much different conversation if my daughter was harmed physically. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11094.23s">This</a>  is all, you know, talk, talk, talk, talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11098.313s">But</a>  at some point, it's gonna become physical. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11102.84s">Um,</a>  so that was April. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11107.022s">Then</a>  we have so we figured okay, the summit, you know, summertime, everything's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11112.504s">Go</a>  back to school September. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11115.425s">September</a>  really familiar September 28. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11118.767s">Another</a>  police report. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11121.108s">Officer</a>  Conway calls me and tells me what's going on at the school and now my daughter is being escorted to her classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11129.407s">because</a>  these girls are following her to her locker. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11132.449s">She</a>  doesn't even use the bathroom at school. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11135.11s">But</a>  last week she did because she's in the medical assisting program. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11138.772s">She</a>  went into the bathroom with her other medical assisting friends to change into their uniforms. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11145.956s">I</a>  call this one girl a ringleader. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11148.438s">She's</a>  not in the school right now, because once she turned 16, she was allowed to drop out. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11153.761s">Fine.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11156.042s">But</a>  she calls her <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11157.987s">you</a>  know, gang of friends, if you will. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11160.508s">Hey,</a>  so and so, you know, follow her, follow her, follow her. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11165.011s">Many</a>  different names are on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11166.552s">I</a>  know they're minors. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11167.412s">I</a>  can't mention their names, but they are on the police reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11170.534s">They</a>  have it's it's sickening last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11175.357s">So</a>  that was September 29. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11180.059s">Just</a>  last week, a different batch of girls from this original ringleader sent <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11187.865s">another</a>  group of girls into the bathroom and cornered her in there and tried to jump her. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11196.269s">So</a>  those girls were sent home. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11199.591s">And</a>  then the boys had a fight. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11201.832s">And</a>  then of course, retaliation happened yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11207.235s">I</a>  don't know what's going on in the bathrooms, but there's a lot of drug use in the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11212.958s">Everybody</a>  knows it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11214.098s">These</a>  kids are in the bathroom doing drugs and whatever else they're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11218.74s">Some</a>  of the drugs were laced. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11220.38s">I'm</a>  hearing that's why there were some overdoses. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11223.361s">I</a>  don't know that, it could be hearsay. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11225.922s">However,</a>  to get anything done, I can understand parents' frustrations on getting something on paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11236.065s">So</a>  I collected my three incident reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11240.766s">I</a>  went to the, Officer Conway gave them to me at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11247.045s">I</a>  then went to Metro Police Department to file a new report for a new incident. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11253.248s">And</a>  I went to the sample courthouse sample courthouse said they're juveniles, you got to go to the Cambridge courthouse. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11258.65s">I</a>  go to the Cambridge courthouse, where's your daughter? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11260.691s">I'm</a>  like, she's in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11261.732s">Well,</a>  you have to have your daughter with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11264.073s">It's</a>  very frustrating that nothing can be done immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11266.814s">I</a>  get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11267.914s">But</a>  I know that a lot of parents probably don't want to go through that whole process of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11272.816s">But</a>  you have to, unfortunately. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11276.768s">So</a>  I get my police reports in order. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11280.169s">I</a>  go to the Cambridge courthouse, file my paperwork with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11285.95s">They</a>  give me a court date. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11288.051s">The</a>  girl and her mom show up about two hours late. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11290.411s">And</a>  then she tells the judge, hey, I gotta go. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11292.212s">I</a>  gotta go pick up my kid at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11294.432s">Yeah,</a>  that's not how it works. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11296.253s">You're</a>  here because you're harassing my daughter and many others. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11300.534s">This</a>  girl is a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11302.894s">And</a>  so on all of her friends that are still in the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11306.678s">Why</a>  aren't they expelled? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11307.838s">Why</a>  aren't they suspended? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11309.099s">I</a>  get it, mass law, everybody's entitled to their education. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11312.961s">My</a>  daughter's entitled to an education and she's not a troublemaker. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11319.143s">She</a>  has never touched anybody in that school. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11321.424s">And</a>  I'll be damned if somebody puts a finger on her, because this would be a different conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11327.887s">So</a>  then I get a court date, then it's, oh, let's try mediation. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11332.749s">Yeah,</a>  we tried that at school and the girl jumped over the desk <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11336.935s">and</a>  try to attack the principal, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11340.537s">So</a>  then last week, Mrs. Watha says to me, well, your daughter is the target because she's very nice, she's happy, these girls are jealous, she's very social, she's popular, I commend your daughter for staying strong. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11358.525s">But</a>  nothing's happening because this is still ongoing. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11362.126s">Yeah,</a>  that's great, she's a good kid, we all know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11365.623s">So</a>  why are the good kids being punished and why aren't the bad kids out of the school? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11371.106s">For</a>  example, a couple of them went over to the Tufts Curtis. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11373.927s">Guess</a>  what? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11374.307s">It</a>  didn't work out there for them either. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11376.808s">I</a>  don't care if they have problems at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11378.289s">We</a>  all have problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11380.25s">Don't</a>  bring it to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11381.33s">That's</a>  supposed to be their safe place. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11386.953s">Can't</a>  go to the bathroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11387.853s">My</a>  daughter doesn't go to the bathroom at school. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11389.474s">She</a>  holds it until, we pick her up and drop her off every single day. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11394.344s">She's</a>  never taken public transportation because you know what happens on the public transportation? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11399.246s">They're</a>  smoking, they're doing their thing, they're fighting, they're offloading the kids in Medford Square because there's a brawl on the bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11407.551s">They</a>  all have to get off the bus, go on another bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11409.952s">I</a>  don't want my daughter experiencing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11413.474s">So</a>  we go to mediation and we get the complaint for protection for harassment, a harassment prevention order. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11423.561s">I</a>  sign it, my husband signs it, my daughter signs it, the girl signs it, her mom signs it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11429.846s">Two</a>  weeks later, the girl's harassing my daughter again. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11433.909s">And</a>  she's not even in the school, but she's taking pictures of her, taking screenshots of her, posting it on social media and saying nasty things about her. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11442.516s">So</a>  that's a violation. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11444.838s">Nothing</a>  happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11447.26s">So</a>  then we reach out to the superintendent <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11454.774s">And</a>  they send me a 34 page pamphlet on bullying, investigation and response forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11465.7s">So</a>  this first seven pages that you have to fill out the bullying incident report, the police reports, I guess aren't enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11476.286s">And</a>  then there'll be a bullying investigation form, which <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11481.962s">is</a>  two pages. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11482.702s">So</a>  I guess whoever this was handed to is supposed to fill this out to see what has been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11488.843s">Now</a>  this was passed in on Friday because this happened either Wednesday or Thursday last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11495.625s">And</a>  then there's going to be a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11501.446s">What's</a>  the plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11503.066s">All</a>  this paperwork has done nothing, nothing, nothing at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11510.013s">There's</a>  married people that get restraining orders on each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11512.695s">They</a>  end up killing each other anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11514.496s">The</a>  piece of paper isn't doing anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11518.138s">So</a>  I don't know what the answers are gonna be, but what's gonna happen is people are gonna start taking this into their own hands because the people that are supposed to be leaders in the community and our superintendent of schools, the administration, nobody wants to take responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11535.549s">I</a>  mean, how much do parents have to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11541.318s">You</a>  know, my daughter wasn't physically harmed. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11544.86s">Hers</a>  was. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11546.621s">We're</a>  in the same situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11548.222s">Tons</a>  of police reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11549.342s">And</a>  I only brought the ones that I had to bring. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11552.484s">You</a>  only need three. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11553.884s">I</a>  have probably 20. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11555.565s">She's</a>  got a whole bag full of paperwork. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11558.466s">It's</a>  all papers.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11559.427s">This</a>  is the bag I carry around. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11560.908s">This</a>  is my whole life right now.</p>

    <p>[Copran]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11563.249s">All</a>  talk, talk, talk, no action at all.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11569.527s">I</a>  can't even imagine. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11570.488s">Three.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11578.253s">And</a>  of course my OCD, everything's color coded. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11580.514s">Four.</a> </p>

    <p>[Copran]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11584.537s">I</a>  don't want a pile that big. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11586.378s">I</a>  don't want it any thicker than this. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11591.761s">So</a>  we're, you know, as parents, you know, we do the best with our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11597.029s">My</a>  child is a straight A student. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11598.81s">She</a>  wants to go to college. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11599.951s">She</a>  wants to have a future. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11601.032s">She</a>  wants her education. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11602.813s">She</a>  doesn't want any of this other extra stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11605.975s">And</a>  neither does, you know, I just don't understand why the bad kids are still allowed to come back to school.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11613.439s">You</a>  know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11613.879s">Because</a>  they're not bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11614.96s">They</a>  have unexpected behavior and adults aren't doing their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11619.863s">That's</a>  why adults aren't doing their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11623.145s">So</a>  all their unexpected behavior continues. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11627.652s">continues.</a> </p>

    <p>[Copran]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11629.013s">And</a>  yesterday was just like not correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11631.275s">You</a>  know, no, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11633.616s">Yesterday,</a>  you know, you get a text from your child. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11636.578s">Hey,</a>  we're on lockdown for two hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11639.4s">School</a>  didn't even tell us. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11642.243s">I</a>  was at the school before some of the fire trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11644.924s">And</a>  this is when I met Mr. Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11648.727s">And,</a>  you know, I just thought he was I had no idea who anybody was. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11653.015s">But</a>  there were parents there and he's there in his hoodie and his shorts and we're just talking and I didn't have a clue to who he was. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11660.38s">He</a>  was painting his attic or something. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11662.201s">And</a>  I was like, wow, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11663.822s">And</a>  then I see him here tonight and I'm like, oh, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11669.305s">You</a>  know, but I spoke to him just like I spoke to Nicole. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11674.949s">We</a>  just shared our stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11676.657s">There</a>  was another mom there, her son's autistic. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11679.119s">They</a>  attacked him in the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11680.92s">This</a>  isn't isolated, is what I'm getting at. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11684.903s">This</a>  is a daily occurrence. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11687.785s">Every</a>  single day, if it's not my daughter, it's someone else's. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11691.468s">I</a>  don't know anything about much of the boy stuff, but the girls, there's groups of them that target the educated children, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11705.307s">The</a>  parents that I go to at the courthouse, they're not doing anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11711.129s">Oh,</a>  that's okay, sweetheart, you don't have to go to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11713.41s">We'll</a>  send you somewhere else. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11715.33s">Where</a>  am I gonna send my daughter? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11716.811s">Why</a>  should I have to pull her out of school? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11718.411s">No,</a>  absolutely not. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11720.272s">She's</a>  there for a reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11722.472s">Excitement</a>  about being in the vocational. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11725.533s">You're</a>  getting a certificate when you graduate. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11729.614s">You</a>  can use that towards <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11732.192s">going</a>  to college, she plays sports, she's very active, she does community service. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11737.296s">I</a>  mean, these other kids are not doing any of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11740.999s">They're</a>  not even going to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11743.762s">So</a>  that's my say. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11746.764s">I</a>  found out about this meeting from Nicole. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11751.348s">So</a>  I will probably be here more often than not. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11755.272s">Now</a>  that I know, I had to actually Google how to get here because never had to be here before. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11761.116s">but</a>  I'm here for Nicole, I'm here to speak on behalf of other parents as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11768.419s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11769.239s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11770.339s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11771.26s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11771.94s">Madam</a>  President, through you to the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11775.941s">Do</a>  we know how many reports like this are throughout our school? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11781.363s">I</a>  mean, yesterday when I was there with Councilor Scarpelli, I heard the young lady telling Councilor Scarpelli about her incidents <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11789.837s">with</a>  going to the police and believe it or not, I probably heard the same story from a half a dozen other people that were standing outside waiting for the drone saying they had all filed police reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11800.765s">How</a>  many police reports have been filed over the last year in the school?</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11804.428s">We</a>  did have the council pass a resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11806.89s">We</a>  voted on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11808.991s">The</a>  council two weeks ago and I did actually I called Chief Buckley as well.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11814.248s">I</a>  say I met half a dozen people outside what's what's on Councilor Scarpelli yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11819.192s">And</a>  they were all saying the same thing that you know, they all they all have reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11822.955s">They</a>  will restraining orders and I don't know why they're not being enforced. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11828.239s">I</a>  mean, can we get a number?</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11830.441s">The</a>  request is in and I get as we've learned tonight, sometimes those requests don't get where they're supposed to go.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11835.285s">So</a>  I have I did another request we won't get.</p>

    <p>[Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11840.24s">Sorry,</a>  just to add one thing, and I don't know if I had mentioned it to you, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11844.903s">I</a>  can't keep track. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11847.105s">I</a>  can look at all my notes. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11849.286s">But</a>  the resolution had talked about incidents that Officer Conway could put together. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11854.31s">I</a>  believe it was 30 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11858.013s">And</a>  will that include incident reports within the school? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11862.496s">Not</a>  just the police reports, but student on student violence in the schools that's handled within <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11868.883s">an</a>  assistant principal, a principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11870.304s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11870.484s">I</a>  just want to make sure that that was all included, not just from the SRO because he would only have access.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11875.708s">I</a>  don't know what we'll get back, but that's okay.</p>

    <p>[Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11877.649s">Cause</a>  cause, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11878.51s">Because,</a>  um, he can only produce the stuff from the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11883.153s">So,</a>  all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11883.634s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11883.894s">Thank</a>  you so much.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11884.474s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11887.377s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11888.718s">Um,</a>  I, it's, it's hard to add anything after a story like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11892.12s">I</a>  don't have anything to add. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11893.001s">I</a>  just wanted to thank you for, for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11894.882s">Thank</a>  you for sharing your story. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11896.739s">Um,</a>  I'm not a parent. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11898.04s">I</a>  can't fathom what it's like to be a parent and go through something like that, something that unfortunately a lot of families in our public school systems have to go through. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11905.024s">It's</a>  heartbreaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11905.745s">I</a>  just want to say, you know, our hearts go out to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11907.586s">Thank</a>  you for being here.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11909.808s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11910.128s">And</a>  I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11910.448s">Yeah,</a>  I think everyone is coming to speak for the first time tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11914.25s">I</a>  know it's not easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11915.011s">I</a>  know it's really hard and I appreciate you taking the time of your night to come speak before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11919.594s">You</a>  know, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11924.652s">Sometimes</a>  they're 20 minutes, sometimes they're five hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11926.613s">You</a>  never know until you're here. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11929.835s">So,</a>  but I appreciate, and I think a lot of us that if we went to public schools, you know, I graduated 20 years ago, there were some of these, I didn't go to Medford High, I went to a different high school that had many of its own issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11942.342s">But</a>  I think it's very clear that some of us may have experienced stuff similar, but stuff has gotten to a level that I think is unimaginable for a lot of us that were in high school, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11952.985s">possibly</a>  even 10 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11954.266s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11954.727s">I</a>  think second smartphones get added. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11957.229s">It</a>  seems like stuff I can't even imagine. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11959.532s">So</a>  I really appreciate you coming out to talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11963.376s">My</a>  heart goes out to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11964.337s">I'm</a>  a mother of a very young child, but this is stuff that, of course, we're all thinking of constantly. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11970.423s">So</a>  I appreciate you taking the time to share your stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11974.395s">as</a>  a Councilor and as a mother. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11975.756s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11977.658s">I</a>  do see Councilors saying, and then I'm going to go to one person on zoom and then we'll come back to Mr. Okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11982.322s">Councilor</a>  Tseng bears will go to zoom and we'll come back to Mr. South.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11989.131s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=11989.852s">Um,</a>  I also wanted to thank the parents for coming up and telling you the stories and I hadn't heard the story before. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12000.363s">And</a>  I think President Morello, you put it well that even though I even though I was there five years ago, I think things have <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12008.972s">you</a>  know, things are slightly different now and smartphones and COVID and all of that changes everything as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12016.034s">So</a>  it's actually, it's really helpful to hear that perspective.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12022.015s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12023.016s">President</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12024.316s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12025.176s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12025.856s">I</a>  also want to want to thank you for coming out to everyone who spoke tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12028.817s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12029.037s">Ripley,</a>  you were really good. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12033.525s">And</a>  the students who spoke last night as well, I think that that takes a lot of courage because you're going back there and you know what it's like. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12040.548s">And</a>  I just want to say to President Morell's point, I graduated 2011 from Medford High School, my sister 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12050.951s">And</a>  there were clicks and bullying and police reports and issues that we faced in our time at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12064.169s">I</a>  think, again, there's not much more I can add. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12068.085s">People</a>  have been experiencing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12069.646s">It's</a>  clearly worse now than it's ever been before. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12071.766s">And</a>  I think we've talked about a lot of the reasons that that's true. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12076.048s">And</a>  this council and the school committee, and I think everyone involved is, you know, Mr. Ripley talked about resources, seeing every day the teachers and staff not having the resources that they're asking for to help address these problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12091.873s">And</a>  I think, again, that's something that for me personally, I think is, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12096.695s">What</a>  I'm going to keep hammering on is trying to get more resources into the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12100.096s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12100.716s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12101.556s">I'm</a>  going to Jada Higgins on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12104.096s">I</a>  will unmute you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12105.036s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12106.937s">And</a>  I also do want to know if there's anyone who does not feel comfortable giving their address, they can message it to the clerk privately. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12112.238s">So</a>  going to Jada Higgins, if you are still there.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12116.178s">I</a>  know your hand's been up for a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12123.74s">Trying</a>  to unmute you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12128.095s">All</a>  right, we'll come back to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12131.677s">If</a>  you're on zoom your hands up and find your way back to your screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12135.458s">Mr.</a>  South. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12137.459s">You</a>  know, just for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Steven South]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12139.6s">Stephen</a>  South 106 Damon Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12143.522s">Good</a>  afternoon or evening now. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12146.323s">Madam</a>  Chairman, members of the city council, Mr. City Clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12151.463s">Um,</a>  I'm also the secretary treasurer of Teamsters Local 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12155.788s">We</a>  represent all of the Medford public schools, custodians, security staff, assistant principals, coordinators, directors and others. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12166.761s">Um,</a>  I've heard a lot tonight about what happened 30 years ago, what happened <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12173.112s">when</a>  when other people were kids that and I, I wrote down some of the things were said this is a national issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12180.221s">This</a>  has been going on for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12182.964s">There's</a>  been 30 years of issue issues school violence has been around for a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12187.911s">I</a>  was assaulted in middle school. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12190.234s">I</a>  mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12191.655s">None</a>  of that is relevant to what's going on now. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12194.418s">So</a>  I agree with someone said earlier, we're talking about right here, right now, and issues with the children in this community not being safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12203.065s">No</a>  one cares what happened 30 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12205.387s">It's</a>  not relevant to what we're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12210.111s">I</a>  hear people comparing what's going on now to many years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12214.975s">I've</a>  represented employees in this city and this school system since 2007 and worked very closely. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12221.838s">I'm</a>  at the high school every week for different various reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12227.22s">But</a>  like I always do when I come here and I've come to talk about these issues in the last year, multiple times at city council, multiple times at the school committee, I've had many in-person meetings at <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12240.2s">the</a>  high school with central administration officials regarding security issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12246.984s">Now</a>  I wanna start giving you some facts and then I'm going to give you some facts in writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12253.407s">Number</a>  one, there was an overdose yesterday, which is disturbing to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12258.17s">There</a>  are guns and knives in Medford High School, and I've been saying that for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12263.933s">And</a>  yesterday, the stabbing, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12268.036s">prove</a>  that that is true. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12269.877s">So</a>  you can bang the gavel, but that's a fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12272.119s">There</a>  was a stabbing yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12274.801s">There's</a>  hundreds of kids that roam the halls on any given day, and loiter in the bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12282.406s">There's</a>  a group of kids that congregate in the bathrooms and wait for unsuspecting students to come in, and they bully them or beat them up or threaten them. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12290.592s">That</a>  happens often, all the time, and the administration's aware of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12296.015s">School</a>  employees, and I've talked to dozens of my members in the last two days, you know, checking on them, seeing what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12305.423s">And</a>  many of them have expressed to me, these are the employees of Medford Public Schools, that they're afraid. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12311.788s">They're</a>  afraid to go to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12314.99s">School</a>  employees are being threatened. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12316.952s">School</a>  employees are being assaulted. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12320.205s">Okay,</a>  there are fights and assaults every day at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12325.127s">I</a>  can tell you recently I was at a meeting, a security meeting by the way, and one of my security staff was there and twice in 20 minutes she got called away on a radio to altercations. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12338.091s">This</a>  is a woman and evidently they want her to break up fights and she has no formal training. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12345.714s">There's</a>  graffiti daily in the bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12348.585s">There's</a>  no documentation of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12352.907s">The</a>  staff are just told to paint over it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12356.229s">And</a>  I've instructed my members, your employees, to now take pictures of it and document these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12362.332s">And</a>  we'll get into reporting in a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12365.974s">Part</a>  of the problem with these assaults on staff and on students is there's a policy that the staff aren't allowed to touch the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12374.852s">So</a>  when there's a fight, you're not supposed to break it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12378.675s">And</a>  this is being reiterated to my members. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12383.858s">Talking</a>  about reporting. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12385.499s">There's</a>  incidents every day at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12387.46s">There's</a>  no formal reporting system at the high school for the incidents where students are telling my members and school employees to F themselves, F off every single day. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12400.809s">They</a>  don't listen to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12402.91s">There's</a>  no consequences. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12405.597s">And</a>  when I talk to my members, which are your employees, about how these are being reported, they talk to their superiors and they say, OK, and that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12416.284s">They're</a>  not asked to fill out forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12419.206s">So</a>  we created our own reporting form. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12424.925s">Teamsters</a>  Local 25 Employee Work-Related Incident Report, which now our members, effective recently, are filling these out anytime there's an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12435.434s">So</a>  we're not gonna allow the central administration anymore to brush all these issues every day under the rug. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12441.139s">We</a>  are going to track them because the school committee and the school administration is not tracking them, that's a fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12449.345s">Now</a>  we wanna talk about for a second, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12452.549s">and</a>  I know it's getting late, but I wanna talk about how long this has been going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12456.613s">I</a>  talked about coming to the meetings and speaking to the council and the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12462.218s">I</a>  brought an agenda today, which I'd like to hand out. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12466.082s">And</a>  this is from exactly one year ago.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12471.567s">To</a>  your point, Mr. South, I think people were trying to set context when they spoke about previous years, just as you're trying to set context now.</p>

    <p>[Steven South]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12477.713s">Now,</a>  this is relevant. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12478.953s">So</a>  if you give me a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12480.634s">As</a>  was what they said before.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12482.234s">As</a>  was what they said before.</p>

    <p>[Steven South]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12483.114s">This</a>  is a meeting about security.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12485.575s">As</a>  was what they said before. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12486.915s">I</a>  want to make that clear.</p>

    <p>[Steven South]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12488.096s">Yeah,</a>  you make clear whatever you want.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12489.636s">Point</a>  of information.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12490.436s">Vice</a>  President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12491.176s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12493.397s">The</a>  idea that we shouldn't contextualize an issue and analyze it to find solutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12501.239s">I</a>  mean, yeah, what happened in the past is relevant. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12503.339s">You're</a>  doing it right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12504.28s">So</a>  I just want to make that point.</p>

    <p>[Steven South]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12506.957s">This</a>  is a meeting in the heading says City of Medford School Security Issues December 16, 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12515.72s">One</a>  year ago exactly. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12517.32s">And</a>  there is a point to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12519.161s">There's</a>  13 bullet points on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12520.761s">This</a>  is a meeting with top central administration officials, myself and my two stewards. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12528.543s">Kevin</a>  and Bill who is now retired. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12531.906s">Number</a>  one, we have zero security guards. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12534.187s">Bill</a>  Mosaic is retiring after 47 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12537.47s">Today,</a>  we still have zero security guards because that position has now been eliminated as of 2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12543.074s">That</a>  is very relevant to what we're talking about today. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12547.458s">Number</a>  two, the city's having monitors. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12550.3s">These</a>  are people that sit at the front desk. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12552.782s">A</a>  few of them are in their 70s. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12555.287s">perform</a>  security guard work from monitor pay $17.50 an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12560.469s">Number</a>  three, and by the way, there's still $17.50 an hour because our contract's been expired over a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12567.092s">Number</a>  three, no security training is being provided to monitors who are being asked to perform security guard functions. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12573.874s">That</a>  was a year ago to this day, this is relevant. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12577.176s">They've</a>  hired four new security monitors this school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12580.99s">Zero</a>  training, not one speck of training, nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12584.736s">That's</a>  relevant. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12586.879s">Number</a>  four, it says the city never replaced Joe Misuraca school security monitor that retired before the school year began. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12594.65s">We're</a>  shorthanded in the monitor group. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12596.918s">It's</a>  relevant because today we're still shorthanded. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12599.018s">There's</a>  still vacancies. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12600.539s">We're</a>  not fully staffed. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12602.459s">And</a>  that's because of the poor pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12604.52s">Number</a>  five, the schools are unsafe due to lack of security. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12608.961s">No</a>  guards and no school resource officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12612.281s">At</a>  that time last year, we had no school resource officer because he was out injured and the school committee and the administration chose not to replace him. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12622.184s">So</a>  we had no security guards. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12625.274s">and</a>  no police in the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12627.595s">Number</a>  six, after school security at door 31 has been canceled since school has been back to full-time in-person learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12637.999s">In</a>  nice weather, the door is propped open with a cone. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12641.58s">In</a>  the cold weather, it is left unlocked and anyone can walk in uncontested.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12646.102s">Can</a>  I ask, when you talk about security issues like that, you not be so specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12649.743s">It</a>  makes it more vulnerable and dangerous.</p>

    <p>[Steven South]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12651.104s">Well,</a>  it's a fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12652.164s">We</a>  used to, for many years, we had security <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12654.744s">at</a>  the back door anytime there were school activities going on, the school committee canceled it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12662.566s">It's</a>  not the dangerous situation is being caused by the school committee and the central administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12669.228s">Number</a>  seven, the kids have been coming increasingly bold since the city stopped suspensions and expulsions this school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12677.93s">Example,</a>  a student recently told Janet who's a monitor to suck his blank <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12684.992s">when</a>  she told him to go back to class. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12686.792s">There</a>  was no discipline for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12689.253s">That</a>  happens every day, every single day. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12691.714s">And</a>  that's two today, very relevant. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12693.874s">Number</a>  eight, there's an extraordinary amount of violence in the schools, on the buses and at Playstead Park after school. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12701.576s">This</a>  is due to number one through six above, not COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12708.618s">Number</a>  nine, anyone such as kids that don't attend Medford High School can walk right into the school in the morning <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12715.018s">as</a>  the students don't have to show IDs. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12717.44s">The</a>  doors are open, everyone walks right in. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12719.322s">There's</a>  one person at the front desk. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12721.604s">Number</a>  10, there are not metal detectors in the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12725.468s">We've</a>  been talking about this for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12727.77s">And</a>  I know that last night after I left, people were saying from the school committee, this would take too long. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12733.916s">Well,</a>  I don't care how long it takes. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12736.663s">When</a>  people are bringing weapons into the schools, there should be metal detectors. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12741.667s">And</a>  I know that there's talk in the State House right now of rolling that out in parts of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12749.152s">Number</a>  11, no training is being provided. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12752.794s">As</a>  detailed in Article 23, our employees are not being provided the tools to perform their jobs to the best of their ability. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12758.979s">Again,</a>  zero training to the new employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12761.981s">So</a>  when people talk about, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12764.888s">I</a>  heard last night school committee members talking about how amazing of a job the security people and other people did. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12771.694s">Well,</a>  it's obviously instinct because it's not from training and they did do a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12776.098s">And</a>  I commend all the teachers and staff that operated and conducted themselves in an amazing fashion yesterday to keep the kids safe, but it's not from training. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12788.745s">Number</a>  12, in years past, when the city has had security drills, they do not include the security monitors or custodians, even though they are the first line of defense in an emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12801.088s">And</a>  number 13, there's no phone in the custodial break room. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12805.729s">When</a>  the radios are down, just like yesterday, they can't communicate with management as cell phones don't work in the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12811.91s">So</a>  the reason I gave this document, this is a meeting we had <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12815.276s">One</a>  year ago, exactly. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12816.577s">We've</a>  had meetings since then. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12817.798s">I've</a>  spoken at the meetings since then and exactly nothing has been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12822.461s">Not</a>  one through 13, not one single bullet point has been addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12829.807s">Meaning</a>  that obviously people aren't doing their jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12834.07s">So</a>  you heard earlier, people should step up or step down. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12837.392s">That's</a>  a fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12838.854s">And</a>  there's an election in less than a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12840.675s">And</a>  I know this community, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12842.783s">will</a>  force that issue if things aren't done correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12845.944s">So</a>  I'll end with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12851.506s">The</a>  most disturbing thing I saw last night was the lack of compassion and empathy for the families and students in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12858.989s">You</a>  had parents that were here that were dealt with petrified students yesterday, upset families, parents that drove to the high school and sat outside for hours just to make sure their kids were safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12871.74s">school</a>  committee members yesterday arguing with parents at the microphone. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12876.543s">I</a>  saw one school committee member doing the hand gesture and saying blah, blah, blah from the seat. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12882.867s">That's</a>  disrespectful. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12884.608s">And</a>  you hear the same people talking about community and being in unity and coming together to find solutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12892.273s">Well,</a>  lead by example, show some sympathy and empathy to these families <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12899.149s">that</a>  were literally afraid whether their child was gonna come home yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12903.152s">And</a>  you see the news every day, the shootings and stabbings all over the country, and have a little tact and show some respect to the people that elected you to your positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12918.221s">So</a>  the last thing I'll say is this, there's been a lot of talk last night, a lot of talk tonight, but what everyone really wants to see in this community <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12927.536s">especially</a>  the families and the students and people's neighbors and everybody, they wanna see action. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12934.958s">Let's</a>  hire some security guards. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12937.179s">Let's</a>  bring them back. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12937.899s">We</a>  used to have over a dozen of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12939.319s">We</a>  used to have a security guard or more than one in every single school. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12943.76s">Now</a>  we have zero in any of the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12946.921s">Let's</a>  have more school resource officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12949.262s">Let's</a>  have more police in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12951.103s">We're</a>  severely short-staffed in police and fire and DPW and teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12956.857s">All</a>  over the community, every position is short-staffed. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12961.358s">Let's</a>  fully fund these positions that matter most to keep the community, especially the children, safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12969.599s">I</a>  want to see action. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12971.32s">Talk</a>  is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12972.4s">It's</a>  great at the water cooler. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12973.68s">It's</a>  great at the coffee shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12975.3s">I</a>  want to see action. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12976.28s">The</a>  families want to see action. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12978.221s">I</a>  respectfully ask all of you to do what you can in your capacity, and I know you're not members of the school committee, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12985.715s">but</a>  use your power and your influence and your skills that you have many and find ways to put action in place, not just talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12996.603s">And</a>  I thank you all for your kind attention.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=12999.726s">This</a>  is embarrassing.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13000.687s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13002.788s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. South. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13004.109s">I</a>  appreciate acknowledging the national scope of the issue and the need for significant funding considering the massive underfunding of our city government. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13011.755s">I</a>  just had one question, which is who wrote this document?</p>

    <p>[Steven South]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13018.235s">I</a>  did and I presented it to all the administration officials at Medford High School on that date for the meeting that we held. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13025.817s">I</a>  drafted it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13026.477s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13027.438s">I'm</a>  going to go to some folks on Zoom and then I'll come. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13029.698s">So</a>  going to Tony Tanks, name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Puccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13033.739s">Hi,</a>  Tony Puccio, Canada Street, Medford Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13038.641s">I</a>  know a lot of what I have to say is probably better said in front of the school committee, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13043.538s">This</a>  is an opportunity that was presented by Councilor Scarpelli last night. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13047.862s">So</a>  I'm gonna take advantage of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13049.003s">And</a>  I have a feeling there's gonna be a few people on the committee watching anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13051.905s">So</a>  I don't believe for a second, any of the school committee members actually wanted this to happen, this incident, but it happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13060.673s">It</a>  happened under their watch. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13062.794s">It</a>  happened in spite of and in line with the policy they wrote and passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13068.88s">It</a>  happened <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13072.302s">even</a>  though all the warnings that many of us have given them repeatedly, it still happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13079.746s">The</a>  school committee went to self-defense mode and self-preservation mode last night. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13084.509s">And</a>  it was in no way conducive to the situation that they and us, the community members are in. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13091.812s">I</a>  do commend the committee for lifting the new rules, which are obnoxiously restrictive to community participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13098.353s">So</a>  for that, I'm thankful. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13100.594s">There's</a>  no study that needs to be done that can replace time-tested methods and common sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13105.695s">Kids</a>  need structure, they need guidance, they need discipline, and they need to experience the consequences that come from the behaviors that warrant it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13114.036s">One</a>  of the most important yet least mentioned factors I've noted while observing the discussion surrounding this trend of violence <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13120.285s">in</a>  schools is the lack of attention given to parental responsibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13124.586s">Where</a>  are the parents during all this? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13126.267s">Are</a>  they being held accountable for the actions of their children, or for the most part, minors? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13131.168s">If</a>  the school system is serious about correcting this climate of violence, then are there any plans to put in place that hold parents accountable for the behavior of their children? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13142.772s">It's</a>  not a school's primary function to be the disciplinarian. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13146.193s">Schools</a>  and faculty need to educate <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13149.321s">Parents</a>  need to parent. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13151.282s">Parents</a>  of offenders need to be part of the solution when dispensing punishment. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13155.404s">And</a>  along with punishment, there needs to be a way to track and determine if patterns are developing that can be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13161.867s">There</a>  are many community members that have great ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13164.548s">They're</a>  not guaranteed solutions, but who knows something might be worthy of further conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13169.591s">And</a>  this study won't cost $50,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13172.382s">That</a>  plan should include immediate implementation and has to be addressed like an assembly or other means where students are made aware of the rules and clear consequences for further refractions. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13185.151s">I</a>  try to be as active as I can as a vocational school graduate, a night school teacher, and more importantly, for the sake of my child's education. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13192.436s">And</a>  I've heard from teachers, one of which whom, when I asked, what do you think is a good, solid way to help prevent, one good, solid way to help prevent some of this violence? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13200.989s">And</a>  their answer was a pretty attainable one. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13203.37s">They</a>  suggested placing cameras at the entrance points to every bathroom in the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13208.371s">Even</a>  if it's not a full-time monitored camera, having a record of who enters and exits the restrooms would certainly make wrongdoers think twice about causing trouble. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13217.774s">My</a>  own child would have benefited from this when an incident took place that several bathrooms throughout the school that affected her. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13223.656s">It</a>  would have been a lot easier to identify the perpetrators. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13229.598s">We've</a>  heard this before. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13231.151s">Never</a>  let a good crisis go to waste. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13233.312s">MedFed</a>  has enough money when it comes to school safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13236.252s">There</a>  can be no higher priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13239.013s">As</a>  councilors stated, funds need to be reallocated and an in-depth conversation needs to be had to figure out what is more important than safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13248.015s">In</a>  closing, I'm left to wonder if the funds allocated to change the name of the Columbus school was enough to make the parents of the stabbing victim or the Branley family feel any safer. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13256.957s">Step</a>  up or step down. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=13259.098s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nate Merritt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14192.876s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor, and I'll keep it quick because I have a little one at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14196.577s">I'm</a>  here as a parent, but my child is not even in school yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14201.159s">I'm</a>  here because I'm looking at, do I want my child to go to Medford Public Schools? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14205.32s">My</a>  wife asked me a question last night. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14207.5s">She</a>  says, because she read and saw everything on the news. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14210.641s">So</a>  in fact, Councilor Scarpelli, I may ask you a couple of things to get through the chaff. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14217.289s">What</a>  we saw in the news was it was three hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14219.83s">People</a>  were in lockdown. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14220.79s">There</a>  was no official communication on what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14223.831s">And</a>  the only way that students could communicate to their parents was with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14230.653s">Is</a>  that pretty accurate, sir? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14232.413s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14235.434s">I</a>  hate these. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14238.675s">What</a>  really bothered me, and when I saw Councilor Caraviello this morning, first question came to my mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14246.621s">why</a>  were people doing this? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14249.103s">And</a>  I will respectfully disagree with you in the terms of what happened 30 years ago and so on and so forth when I was in high school and longer when you were, because I think there are things we can learn from that, especially in policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14262.471s">Yes,</a>  situations change, environments change, technology changes, and policies change. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14269.235s">But</a>  it doesn't mean that maybe all the changes that we have made are good, and maybe we can learn from history <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14276.206s">and</a>  try to tweak things for the better. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14278.388s">So</a>  I think we should respect their history and not ignore that.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14281.49s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14283.432s">I'm</a>  sorry, maybe you didn't understand what I meant. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14287.175s">It</a>  was the fact that I wanted to bring it back to today. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14291.959s">We</a>  need to focus on today. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14293.78s">We</a>  can't go back to 30 years right now and worry about this today because today is the crisis.</p>

    <p>[Nate Merritt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14300.806s">That's</a>  my intent. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14302.127s">Absolutely,</a>  I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14302.708s">I</a>  didn't mean to sound accused or that, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14304.428s">but</a>  just we should keep in mind that, you know, things that were policies when I was in high school or when you were in high school, maybe you're not necessarily bad things to revisit or consider. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14314.611s">So</a>  I think as a policy action, right, something that doesn't take a lot of money, we could figure out within a week, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14321.694s">People</a>  do hot washes in jobs, in corporate, in the fire service, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14326.524s">In</a>  the military, you do an operation right afterwards, you do a debrief. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14330.227s">What</a>  happened? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14331.328s">How</a>  do we do it better? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14332.209s">In</a>  the medical community, they'll do what they call M&M rounds, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14335.272s">Unfortunately,</a>  if a patient passes away, they wanna figure out how do we get better? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14340.437s">I</a>  think that's something that we should be asking the schools to get within the next week or two. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14347.703s">Why</a>  did it take hours for the school <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14352.093s">to</a>  communicate to parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14354.194s">I</a>  personally don't understand the purpose of a lockdown given this incident and why it was ours. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14358.937s">There's</a>  difference between preserving a crime scene versus locking everyone in because you think it's an active shooter. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14366.181s">I</a>  don't wanna debate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14367.201s">I</a>  have no idea what that is and there may be a rationale. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14370.023s">That</a>  rationale should be communicated to the parents, but also within a week or not even, why did it take so long? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14378.947s">Because</a>  I'd love to see all these gotten rid of from schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14382.715s">But</a>  at the same time, if a parent can't know that their students are safe or their children are safe, then what other mechanism do you have? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14390.999s">So</a>  it's kind of a catch 22. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14393.24s">So</a>  I think we really can do better and this doesn't cost a nickel.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14397.502s">So</a>  last quote that I will leave you all with, we must all fear evil men, but there's another kind of evil which we must fear most.</p>

    <p>[Nate Merritt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14408.546s">And</a>  that is the indifference of good men. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14412.441s">It's</a>  a quote, I'm sorry, but that said, I think it rings true, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14417.404s">Especially</a>  in situations, we can take action, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14421.165s">I</a>  think these are things that could be taken, you know, done now, because otherwise, when my wife asked me, do we send our kid to public schools? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14428.009s">My</a>  answer is no.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14429.37s">I</a>  will work more and send my kid to private school. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=14433.612s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=15439.802s">nothing</a>  more than what she's spending her Apple money on. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=15442.544s">We</a>  don't have any say whatsoever. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=15445.587s">So</a>  I don't understand why we need to entertain these presentations. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=15449.17s">I</a>  mean, all it is is a dog and pony show. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=15450.792s">I</a>  really think it's nothing more than campaigning. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=15453.074s">It's</a>  really campaigning. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=15453.934s">It</a>  has nothing to do with what's going on in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=15455.776s">There's</a>  nothing to do with what's going on with his body. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=15457.497s">It's</a>  campaigning. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=15458.819s">So</a>  I don't think that that should be allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=15460.12s">I</a>  think that if the mayor is going to offer a paper that the paper should be related to issues that require council action by law.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=15489.934s">We</a>  don't want to do anything without doing anything because we want you guys to make sure that if we do it, you're not going to say anything bad if we make a mistake, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=15496.619s">I</a>  mean, ultimately they want verification and validation of the decisions that they make it, but we don't have to take a vote on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=15501.983s">I</a>  mean, come on, be a leader, make decisions.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=15504.985s">It's</a>  like government by committee doesn't work. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=15507.067s">I</a>  mean, is that, are we considering that an official communication that our vote is not required? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=15514.453s">because</a>  we did ask a question as to whether our voters.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=15516.654s">And</a>  that's basically what the chief of staff said kind of the same.</p>
