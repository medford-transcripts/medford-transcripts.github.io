00:00:56,404 --> 00:00:57,365
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

29
00:00:57,385 --> 00:00:57,965
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

30
00:00:58,005 --> 00:01:01,586
[SPEAKER_09]: A motion of Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Knight to table this matter.

31
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:02,486
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

32
00:01:03,046 --> 00:01:03,786
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

33
00:01:04,007 --> 00:01:04,767
[SPEAKER_09]: The matter is tabled.

34
00:01:05,567 --> 00:01:10,588
[SPEAKER_09]: The clerk has notified me that 20-018, offered by Councilor Knight, has been withdrawn.

35
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:16,090
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

36
00:01:16,914 --> 00:01:20,597
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just getting ready for the next one, Mr. President.

37
00:01:20,677 --> 00:01:20,898
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

38
00:01:20,918 --> 00:01:32,307
[SPEAKER_09]: 2-0-019, offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Medford City Council request that the city administration work with National Grid to establish a five-year plan to address level 2 and level 3 gas leaks in the city of Medford.

39
00:01:32,747 --> 00:01:33,228
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

40
00:01:33,873 --> 00:01:35,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

41
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:43,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Last term, this council put forward a resolution that ultimately turned into an ordinance relative to reporting of gas leaks in our community.

42
00:01:43,526 --> 00:01:50,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Through that discussion and debate, it was brought to this council's attention that we have an inordinate number of level 2 and level 3 gas leaks here in the community.

43
00:01:51,655 --> 00:02:04,862
[SPEAKER_02]: The national grid or the public utility in the city have been working on a case-by-case basis to address these, but there's really no five-year plan that's going to say, over this amount of period of time, we're going to tackle X amount of gas leaks that are in the community.

44
00:02:06,617 --> 00:02:12,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Pursuant to state law, level two gas leaks have to be repaired in a certain amount of time after being reported.

45
00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:18,682
[SPEAKER_02]: And level three gas leaks also have to be repaired in a certain amount of time after being reported, which is a little bit more expedient.

46
00:02:19,202 --> 00:02:22,644
[SPEAKER_02]: But right now, we're seeing that these time frames aren't being hit, Mr. President.

47
00:02:22,984 --> 00:02:34,889
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had a number of issues on Boston Avenue, for example, with a gas leak that's going on there in front of number 81 Boston Ave, resulting in the gentleman's pre-dying, his lawn dying, the bushes in front of his house dying because the natural gas is being leaked into the air and

48
00:02:35,929 --> 00:02:39,353
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really a quality of life issue, but it's also a safety issue, Mr. President.

49
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:49,737
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're really going to be serious about climate change and moving away from our reliance on fossil fuels, one of the things we can do, I think, is repair the infrastructure that we have in place so that we're not wasting it.

50
00:02:50,417 --> 00:02:56,061
[SPEAKER_02]: So I bring this resolution forward asking the administration to begin discussions, talking with National Grid to develop a five-year plan.

51
00:02:56,601 --> 00:03:01,024
[SPEAKER_02]: I know sitting next to Councilor Lungo for the past six years, this was something that she was very passionate about.

52
00:03:01,104 --> 00:03:03,726
[SPEAKER_02]: So as mayor, I'm certain to see some action there.

53
00:03:03,746 --> 00:03:06,528
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just wanted to let the mayor know that we support this endeavor.

54
00:03:06,888 --> 00:03:11,373
[SPEAKER_02]: and I hope that we can get behind her and get a five-year plan in place so that we can improve our gas infrastructure here in the community.

55
00:03:12,194 --> 00:03:13,015
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Council Knight.

56
00:03:14,276 --> 00:03:17,900
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Council Knight, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

57
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:18,801
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

58
00:03:19,201 --> 00:03:19,902
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

59
00:03:19,942 --> 00:03:20,643
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion passes.

60
00:03:27,861 --> 00:03:32,326
[SPEAKER_09]: 20-020 offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Medford City Council move forward on the food truck ordinance.

61
00:03:32,667 --> 00:03:33,147
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

62
00:03:33,548 --> 00:03:38,654
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Mr. President, this was an item that was brought up in the 2017 term, then again in the 2019 term.

63
00:03:39,254 --> 00:03:42,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we are in 2020, so I'm hoping that this is an item that we can act on.

64
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:45,161
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that Medford is a little bit

65
00:03:45,902 --> 00:03:49,865
[SPEAKER_02]: behind the times, prehistoric, if you may, when it comes to food trucks.

66
00:03:49,885 --> 00:03:55,009
[SPEAKER_02]: This case-by-case basis that we approve one-day food truck licenses I don't think is in the best interest of the community.

67
00:03:55,369 --> 00:04:05,637
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think by adopting the ordinance that we've been discussing, we'll be in better positions to be a little bit more reflective of the times that are before us and the wants and desires of the community relative to food truck needs.

68
00:04:06,898 --> 00:04:07,718
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

69
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:11,121
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

70
00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:11,882
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

71
00:04:12,162 --> 00:04:12,802
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

72
00:04:12,822 --> 00:04:13,503
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion passes.

73
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:19,546
[SPEAKER_09]: 20-020-021 offered by Council of Beers.

74
00:04:19,947 --> 00:04:31,980
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council request that the city solicitor provide the framework of a draft ordinance enabling the establishment of payments in lieu of taxes pilot commission for council debate and discussion.

75
00:04:37,674 --> 00:04:38,594
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

76
00:04:39,615 --> 00:04:51,326
[SPEAKER_12]: So, as many Medford residents know, some non-profit organizations are, well, all non-profit organizations are tax-exempt and some of them pay what are called payments in lieu of taxes, commonly known as pilots, to the city.

77
00:04:52,046 --> 00:04:55,089
[SPEAKER_12]: The largest, well, not the largest one, but a major one that we discuss is Tufts.

78
00:04:55,469 --> 00:04:56,530
[SPEAKER_12]: There's also River's Edge.

79
00:04:57,651 --> 00:05:03,075
[SPEAKER_12]: And these are typically paid out at least for Tufts in cash payments and in community benefits.

80
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:06,038
[SPEAKER_12]: We currently don't define community benefits.

81
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:17,607
[SPEAKER_12]: And essentially what this would be is starting a discussion where the council and the mayor and residents of the city can kind of figure out how do we want to deal with pilots going forward.

82
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:25,693
[SPEAKER_12]: The proposal for a commission would be a way for the mayor to include other residents whether it be neighbors of Tufts or

83
00:05:26,357 --> 00:05:36,649
[SPEAKER_12]: People with a vested interest or whatever it may be on a commission to negotiate with these nonprofits to talk about what community benefits mean to the city create a definition.

84
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:44,418
[SPEAKER_12]: And then allow us to perhaps have multiple people negotiating these agreements and historically they've been negotiated by the mayor.

85
00:05:44,968 --> 00:05:51,833
[SPEAKER_12]: and also people who could distribute the cash payments and define and relay what community benefits are coming through pilots.

86
00:05:52,153 --> 00:05:56,056
[SPEAKER_12]: The intention of this is to start a discussion, see what an ordinance could look like.

87
00:05:56,476 --> 00:06:04,642
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we'd be doing something differently than we've done in the past and that many neighboring communities do, although there are some examples of things in the past with Boston.

88
00:06:04,702 --> 00:06:09,005
[SPEAKER_12]: So really, just asking to start the conversation about how we address pilots going forward.

89
00:06:09,446 --> 00:06:11,307
[SPEAKER_12]: I know it's a big topic for Tufts and also

90
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:18,285
[SPEAKER_12]: for many residents in the city who have been working very hard trying to make sure that we're getting what the city is due.

91
00:06:18,585 --> 00:06:21,088
[SPEAKER_12]: So that is the intent of the resolution.

92
00:06:21,769 --> 00:06:22,750
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

93
00:06:24,572 --> 00:06:27,876
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Councilor Bears, seconded by Councilor Knight.

94
00:06:29,978 --> 00:06:30,519
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Marks.

95
00:06:31,505 --> 00:06:32,526
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

96
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:39,392
[SPEAKER_05]: The pilot, in lieu of taxes, has been an issue on my plate since I got on the council.

97
00:06:40,213 --> 00:06:44,637
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually, when I first got on the council, the city of Medford didn't have a program at all.

98
00:06:45,618 --> 00:06:53,325
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was at my urging that the mayor back then, Mayor McGlynn, signed the first pilot program, and it was a 10-year program.

99
00:06:53,883 --> 00:06:54,904
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're absolutely right.

100
00:06:54,924 --> 00:06:58,506
[SPEAKER_05]: There was actually no input from the public at all.

101
00:06:58,886 --> 00:07:04,310
[SPEAKER_05]: It was an agreement between the president of Tufts and the mayor of Medford and nothing else.

102
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:17,459
[SPEAKER_05]: So I look forward to the establishment, to be quite honest, of a commission that would be involved, would get public input, and not only in the payment end of it, but also as the city of Boston.

103
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:22,082
[SPEAKER_05]: The city of Boston has, as you may know, has a full-fledged pilot program.

104
00:07:22,782 --> 00:07:27,044
[SPEAKER_05]: And they actively go out and solicit, because you can't make it mandatory.

105
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:28,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Pilot payment is voluntary.

106
00:07:29,725 --> 00:07:33,367
[SPEAKER_05]: And they go out and they actively solicit non-profits.

107
00:07:34,248 --> 00:07:42,472
[SPEAKER_05]: And depending on the size of the non-profit, they have all different criteria on what they seek out.

108
00:07:43,232 --> 00:07:45,436
[SPEAKER_05]: And we really don't have any of that in this community.

109
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:47,699
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a number of small ones.

110
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,705
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe Harvard Vanguard pays a pilot in the community, as well as Tufts.

111
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:58,835
[SPEAKER_05]: But there are other organizations, Mr. President, that may be able to assist.

112
00:07:59,716 --> 00:08:00,816
[SPEAKER_05]: the community when asked.

113
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:04,938
[SPEAKER_05]: And you don't know unless you have a program set up and you don't know unless you ask.

114
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:23,263
[SPEAKER_05]: So I agree with this endeavor and I hope that we can establish, I'm not sure, I think we as a council could meet and committee the whole subcommittee and try to put something together as well as having the city solicitor draft an ordinance.

115
00:08:23,883 --> 00:08:37,429
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think it could be under our purview, Mr. President, to create something that works for not only the nonprofits in the city and the residents, but also the city as a whole.

116
00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:39,490
[SPEAKER_05]: So I support this.

117
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,650
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

118
00:08:43,191 --> 00:08:43,751
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Morell.

119
00:08:44,412 --> 00:08:45,232
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

120
00:08:45,352 --> 00:08:47,393
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to thank Councilor Bears for introducing this.

121
00:08:47,773 --> 00:08:51,695
[SPEAKER_15]: I think beyond the conversations that can happen, this can also probably go a long way in

122
00:08:52,420 --> 00:09:10,001
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolving some of the friction that can sometimes happen between you know people in the city and Tufts because when you don't have when things happen behind closed doors People tend to fill in the blanks and make up their own stories So I think having open conversations as this, you know, if this does move along is really a good thing So I look forward to this coming to fruition.

123
00:09:10,422 --> 00:09:10,702
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

124
00:09:10,943 --> 00:09:11,884
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you console morale

125
00:09:14,277 --> 00:09:14,877
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Bears.

126
00:09:15,317 --> 00:09:21,098
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and I just want to add thank you to Councilors Marks and Morell that have also talked a little bit with the mayor's office.

127
00:09:21,118 --> 00:09:25,119
[SPEAKER_12]: They're interested, and I think if we want to go to Committee of the Whole, draft something.

128
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:32,281
[SPEAKER_12]: If we want to do something in the short term with the mayor's office and then take time on an ordinance, I think all of those avenues are open to us, which is great.

129
00:09:33,581 --> 00:09:34,441
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

130
00:09:35,501 --> 00:09:37,602
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Councilor Bears, seconded by Councilor Knight.

131
00:09:37,922 --> 00:09:38,642
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

132
00:09:41,222 --> 00:09:41,843
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

133
00:09:42,463 --> 00:09:43,303
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion passes.

134
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:49,645
[SPEAKER_09]: 20-022 offered by Councilor Bears and Councilor Morell.

135
00:09:50,245 --> 00:10:04,094
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council request that the City solicitor provide the framework of a draft ordinance enabling the City of Medford to regulate short-term rentals using the authority granted to municipalities pursuant to Chapter 337 of the 2018 Acts and Resolves of Massachusetts.

136
00:10:13,018 --> 00:10:15,161
[SPEAKER_09]: Council appears we'll speak first council appears.

137
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:16,562
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you again Mr. President.

138
00:10:17,323 --> 00:10:28,677
[SPEAKER_12]: So before or in previous meetings we discussed the local option and that has passed through the short term rental act also gives the municipality authority around.

139
00:10:29,235 --> 00:10:36,739
[SPEAKER_12]: the existence and location of operators, licensing, making sure that operators aren't facing code enforcement, and also making sure that they're inspected for health and safety.

140
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:42,081
[SPEAKER_12]: And we also are allowed to assess a small fee to make sure that we can enforce those regulations.

141
00:10:42,121 --> 00:10:42,982
[SPEAKER_12]: So we'll be funded.

142
00:10:43,322 --> 00:10:48,944
[SPEAKER_12]: And turn it over to Councilor Morell, but I think this is something we need to add to the local option.

143
00:10:49,925 --> 00:10:50,945
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

144
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:52,206
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Morell.

145
00:10:52,978 --> 00:10:53,739
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

146
00:10:53,779 --> 00:11:00,166
[SPEAKER_15]: So yeah, the idea behind introducing something like this is to use those powers that are given to us by the state.

147
00:11:01,766 --> 00:11:26,308
[SPEAKER_15]: Laws and to beyond, you know actual codes whether it's in these Short-term rentals posting things like parking practices like trash pickups so that as these are in the neighborhoods They have as little impact on surrounding neighbors as possible while people guests can still go in there And beyond that the idea one of the stronger things that Medford can do is publishing a public registry of these short-term rental accommodations that are throughout the city

148
00:11:27,048 --> 00:11:37,100
[SPEAKER_15]: This is done with considerations to privacy, and we can determine what type of relevant information should be listed relevant to where stuff is located.

149
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:42,827
[SPEAKER_15]: So, again, the idea of safety and really just minimizing the impact that these rentals have on surrounding neighbors.

150
00:11:44,209 --> 00:11:44,469
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

151
00:11:46,528 --> 00:11:47,188
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilman Knight.

152
00:11:47,229 --> 00:11:48,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

153
00:11:48,549 --> 00:11:50,591
[SPEAKER_02]: I commend my colleagues for bringing this paper forward.

154
00:11:51,011 --> 00:12:02,918
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to amend the paper to add paper 15307 and paper 16705, which are two papers that this council and previous councils had discussed relative to regulating short-term rentals in the community.

155
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:09,482
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a discussion that we've been having for a number of years and with the acts and resolves,

156
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:17,245
[SPEAKER_02]: of chapter 337 of 2018, the state legislature had addressed a number of concerns the communities were raising.

157
00:12:18,145 --> 00:12:22,629
[SPEAKER_02]: They addressed the big picture concerns, but left local options available.

158
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:24,390
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is the right approach, Mr. President.

159
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:35,219
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're going to have short-term rentals in our community, and we know that they have an impact on quality of life in neighborhoods, and also an impact on affordable housing stock in our community, I think it makes sense that we regulate them.

160
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:39,062
[SPEAKER_02]: As Councilor Behr said, we had adopted the local option at the last meeting.

161
00:12:39,482 --> 00:12:44,726
[SPEAKER_02]: of the previous session, which would allow us to capture the revenues that are generated through Airbnbs.

162
00:12:44,906 --> 00:12:48,308
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is just the next logical step in further regulation of the situation.

163
00:12:48,348 --> 00:12:50,209
[SPEAKER_02]: So I commend my colleagues for bringing the issue forward.

164
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:58,875
[SPEAKER_02]: I ask that the paper be amended to include those other items that have been previously discussed by this body, so that we can wrap them all up in one nice pretty package and put a bow on it.

165
00:12:58,915 --> 00:12:59,316
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds good.

166
00:12:59,336 --> 00:13:00,076
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

167
00:13:00,116 --> 00:13:03,939
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight, if I may, could you please repeat the two previous papers?

168
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:03,979
[SPEAKER_02]: 16-705.

169
00:13:03,999 --> 00:13:04,019
[SPEAKER_02]: 16-705.

170
00:13:04,059 --> 00:13:04,179
[SPEAKER_02]: And 15-307.

171
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:13,256
[SPEAKER_09]: 15307.

172
00:13:12,475 --> 00:13:13,256
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

173
00:13:13,296 --> 00:13:20,741
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Councilors Morell and Councilors Behr, seconded by Councilor Knight, as amended by Councilor Knight, all those in favor?

174
00:13:21,241 --> 00:13:21,921
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

175
00:13:21,941 --> 00:13:22,782
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion passes.

176
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:38,272
[SPEAKER_09]: 20-025 offered by Councilor Scarpelli, be it resolved that the Health Department and Code Enforcement Officer look into the storage containers that are collecting clothing and furniture in the Felsway Shopping Area parking lot

177
00:13:40,294 --> 00:13:41,936
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli.

178
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:44,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

179
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,683
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had a few phone calls from butters.

180
00:13:48,304 --> 00:13:57,656
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that although it's a shopping center, the people across the street are noticing various unhealthy

181
00:13:59,642 --> 00:14:02,564
[SPEAKER_04]: issues pertaining to the donation bins.

182
00:14:02,724 --> 00:14:04,105
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm all for the donation bin.

183
00:14:04,545 --> 00:14:07,828
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's very positive, but there's got to be a better way to locate it.

184
00:14:08,628 --> 00:14:21,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe if we can look into maybe moving it to the side of the building where the Sherman Williams painting store is, where it's not A, so congested, and B, it abuts sides of other buildings, but still has access to that.

185
00:14:22,457 --> 00:14:26,020
[SPEAKER_04]: I think where it sits right now, it was just clothing.

186
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,722
[SPEAKER_04]: But now people coming all of the night just

187
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:33,783
[SPEAKER_04]: throwing it over the fence and leaving broken furniture.

188
00:14:34,323 --> 00:14:35,584
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like a dump.

189
00:14:36,044 --> 00:14:47,667
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know the intent is well met, but I think that the execution of it has to be done with a little bit more respect for the abutters and for the people that are

190
00:14:49,171 --> 00:14:59,940
[SPEAKER_04]: that will be using the second hand clothing and such, that it be handled in a more humane way, I should say.

191
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,661
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just disgusting.

192
00:15:01,761 --> 00:15:03,963
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we can look into that, I'd appreciate it.

193
00:15:03,983 --> 00:15:04,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

194
00:15:04,644 --> 00:15:05,784
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

195
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:06,325
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

196
00:15:06,785 --> 00:15:08,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

197
00:15:08,245 --> 00:15:11,106
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something that the Council has talked about in the past as well.

198
00:15:11,146 --> 00:15:17,188
[SPEAKER_02]: I do believe, if it wasn't three short months ago, the same resolution was brought up relative to the same collection boxes.

199
00:15:17,888 --> 00:15:22,049
[SPEAKER_02]: In the past, we've talked about the collection boxes at the former site of Meadow Glen Mall, which is now Wegmans.

200
00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:35,872
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's time, Mr. President, that we take a long, hard look at whether or not we want to regulate these type of donation drop boxes in the community through a permitting process, just so that we can protect the interest in neighborhoods and the quality of life in neighborhoods.

201
00:15:36,472 --> 00:15:45,217
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Councilor Marks, I don't want to steal his thunder, but he's going to talk about certain communities that have ordinances and regulations that require these drop boxes be manned and staffed.

202
00:15:45,637 --> 00:15:47,538
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's said this a number of occasions in the past.

203
00:15:48,038 --> 00:15:51,620
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's a good idea that we take a look at this, Mr. President.

204
00:15:51,660 --> 00:16:02,285
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would also suggest that as we move forward and have our health department and our code enforcement officer go and take a look at the site, that we also take a look at developing some controls by way of regulation to

205
00:16:03,866 --> 00:16:06,387
[SPEAKER_02]: better manage these type of entities in our community.

206
00:16:07,328 --> 00:16:08,188
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

207
00:16:10,129 --> 00:16:13,931
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight, are you making a formal amendment to the resolution?

208
00:16:13,971 --> 00:16:15,072
[SPEAKER_02]: We already have a paper in committee.

209
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:15,592
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

210
00:16:17,433 --> 00:16:17,693
[SPEAKER_16]: So, no.

211
00:16:18,414 --> 00:16:18,774
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

212
00:16:20,575 --> 00:16:21,195
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Kavialt.

213
00:16:21,475 --> 00:16:22,136
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

214
00:16:22,176 --> 00:16:32,081
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, while we're discussing on the Fells Way, the planted aid one on Mystic Avenue by the old state sign shop

215
00:16:32,913 --> 00:16:41,735
[SPEAKER_16]: is overrun with things hanging on there, and there's probably four or five feet on both sides of it all, just all full of stuff.

216
00:16:41,775 --> 00:16:46,156
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, it's been snowed on, and anything there now is pretty much garbage now.

217
00:16:47,136 --> 00:16:48,757
[SPEAKER_16]: If you want to donate, it's pretty much worth it.

218
00:16:48,777 --> 00:16:51,297
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you could amend that, you also have the board help.

219
00:16:52,318 --> 00:16:53,038
[SPEAKER_16]: Look at that one too.

220
00:16:53,058 --> 00:16:56,439
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Gav, where the old sign shop was.

221
00:16:56,919 --> 00:16:58,819
[SPEAKER_16]: It's the yellow planted aid box.

222
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:01,020
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

223
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,420
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Marks.

224
00:17:03,542 --> 00:17:04,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

225
00:17:04,503 --> 00:17:06,605
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate Councilor Scarpelli offering this.

226
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:12,289
[SPEAKER_05]: It was Councilor Knight, I think you mentioned two or three months ago, that brought up this similar resolution.

227
00:17:12,749 --> 00:17:20,335
[SPEAKER_05]: And prior to that, I happened to live just right across the street and received a number of complaints over the last several years, Mr. President.

228
00:17:20,715 --> 00:17:22,516
[SPEAKER_05]: I tried to reach out to the owner of the property.

229
00:17:22,536 --> 00:17:23,977
[SPEAKER_05]: I had little success.

230
00:17:24,778 --> 00:17:29,902
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember receiving, three months ago we asked for an update from

231
00:17:30,702 --> 00:17:32,402
[SPEAKER_05]: code enforcement, as well as the Board of Health.

232
00:17:32,963 --> 00:17:41,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, if I am mistaken, I haven't seen any response regarding the bin on the Felsway, Mr. President.

233
00:17:41,784 --> 00:17:53,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Many cities and towns that regulate them, which we do not, will require on the side of the bin that the owner operator's name be listed, a contact number, the size of the bin.

234
00:17:54,966 --> 00:17:57,847
[SPEAKER_05]: These could be very dangerous in nature, these bins, Mr. President.

235
00:17:58,227 --> 00:18:05,309
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds harmless, but that Fells Plaza has seen a number of bins that have just been dropped off.

236
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:11,990
[SPEAKER_05]: So you'll have an entity that just drops off a bin, they don't ask for approval, and all of a sudden they're in business.

237
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:16,331
[SPEAKER_05]: The one in the Fellsway is manned at least six days a week.

238
00:18:17,231 --> 00:18:18,352
[SPEAKER_05]: They have staffing there.

239
00:18:19,212 --> 00:18:23,633
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a full-fledged business that they're running out of the parking lot.

240
00:18:26,399 --> 00:18:28,843
[SPEAKER_05]: So we really have to regulate this, Mr. President.

241
00:18:28,863 --> 00:18:30,205
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's where it starts.

242
00:18:30,606 --> 00:18:32,509
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to regulate these particular bins.

243
00:18:32,889 --> 00:18:34,552
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to know who the contact is.

244
00:18:34,953 --> 00:18:40,021
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's not the owner of the property, Mr. President, as far as I'm concerned, that bin shouldn't be there.

245
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,401
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are the things I think we have to have discussions regarding, and you're right.

246
00:18:46,801 --> 00:18:50,603
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not just clothing, it's old computers, it's furniture.

247
00:18:50,943 --> 00:18:52,384
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to see what's left out there.

248
00:18:52,684 --> 00:18:55,905
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a disgrace, and no one should have to live across the street from that.

249
00:18:56,405 --> 00:18:58,566
[SPEAKER_05]: It attracts rodents and everything else.

250
00:18:59,963 --> 00:19:20,196
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would ask, Mr. President, that if we don't receive a response from our administration, that we as a council put a cease and desist, even though it's not a legitimate business, because I don't think it's registered in this community, but we put a cease and desist on that particular bin, Mr. President, at that plaza.

251
00:19:21,157 --> 00:19:22,478
[SPEAKER_05]: And then maybe we'll get some answers.

252
00:19:23,768 --> 00:19:25,429
[SPEAKER_05]: So that would be my motion, Mr. President.

253
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:42,723
[SPEAKER_05]: If we haven't received any correspondence from the Board of Health or the Building Commissioner, their office, that we send a message to the building department today, tonight, that a cease and desist order be put on that particular bin that's out in the Fells Park parking lot.

254
00:19:43,523 --> 00:19:43,964
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

255
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,125
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

256
00:19:45,425 --> 00:19:48,027
[SPEAKER_09]: So is that an amendment to the Councilor Scarpelli's original motion?

257
00:19:48,047 --> 00:19:49,108
[SPEAKER_05]: If he doesn't mind amending it.

258
00:19:49,168 --> 00:19:50,209
[SPEAKER_05]: If not, we'll... Okay.

259
00:19:50,229 --> 00:19:50,629
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we don't...

260
00:19:54,413 --> 00:19:55,633
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarpelli.

261
00:19:55,853 --> 00:20:16,379
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I applaud the amendment, but I really think we should move on this either committee of the whole or subcommittee meeting on ordinances and that we write something up immediately and follow what our neighbors are doing to make sure that there is somebody watching these organizations because it's terrible.

262
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:17,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

263
00:20:18,358 --> 00:20:18,658
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

264
00:20:18,698 --> 00:20:22,261
[SPEAKER_09]: So there, so console, I mentioned previously that there is a paper in committee right now.

265
00:20:22,301 --> 00:20:22,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on that.

266
00:20:22,982 --> 00:20:25,804
[SPEAKER_09]: So, and I'm sure we can move on that sooner than later.

267
00:20:26,224 --> 00:20:28,787
[SPEAKER_09]: So, so you want to make sure I get this clear.

268
00:20:28,807 --> 00:20:34,311
[SPEAKER_09]: So you want to offer an amendment to the original resolution that would, Mr. President, if I could, sure.

269
00:20:34,351 --> 00:20:34,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Counsel marks.

270
00:20:35,252 --> 00:20:38,515
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't recall seeing, I believe you offered that what, two months, three months ago.

271
00:20:38,535 --> 00:20:40,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, was it two months ago?

272
00:20:41,517 --> 00:20:41,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

273
00:20:42,378 --> 00:20:42,458
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh,

274
00:20:44,245 --> 00:20:52,437
[SPEAKER_02]: The draft ordinance regulating drop boxes I think was introduced quite a bit of time ago.

275
00:20:52,557 --> 00:20:55,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean this was probably the 2018 was when that was introduced.

276
00:20:59,347 --> 00:21:04,070
[SPEAKER_02]: He's met with some opposition and is going through the subcommittee process and just failed to move.

277
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:09,653
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of it had to do with the donation drop boxes that we have at our public schools for the clothing.

278
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:20,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Created some opposition to regulating the drop boxes and then the idea didn't make its way back into the final product of ordinance stages, I guess would be the best way to put it.

279
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:21,520
[SPEAKER_02]: It died on the vine.

280
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:25,642
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is language that is out there that is available and in committee.

281
00:21:26,081 --> 00:21:34,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, but just recently you also offered that it was your resolution that those bins be reviewed by billing department and also the Board of Health.

282
00:21:35,245 --> 00:21:36,726
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't recall seeing a response.

283
00:21:36,786 --> 00:21:37,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we get a response?

284
00:21:37,746 --> 00:21:42,228
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I had a conversation with John Beluso, though, when he did explain to me that he was going to go speak with the property owner.

285
00:21:42,588 --> 00:21:44,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, but we never got a formal communication.

286
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:59,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, and this has been an item for I can't tell you how long, so I would say that we as a council should send a message that we'd like to see a cease and desist until we can find out, Mr. President, what's happening down at that location.

287
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:03,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Why are things being left and strewn all over the place down there?

288
00:22:03,881 --> 00:22:07,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Why is there a full-time staff six days a week?

289
00:22:08,097 --> 00:22:09,537
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, what's going on?

290
00:22:09,957 --> 00:22:12,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it a regulated business that has staff?

291
00:22:12,918 --> 00:22:14,279
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, go down there any time, you'll see.

292
00:22:14,619 --> 00:22:15,179
[SPEAKER_05]: They man it.

293
00:22:15,259 --> 00:22:17,859
[SPEAKER_05]: They have someone that sits inside the bin itself.

294
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,060
[SPEAKER_05]: It's open for business.

295
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,200
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a legit business.

296
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,441
[SPEAKER_09]: Believe it or not, too long ago, it was on fire.

297
00:22:24,141 --> 00:22:25,241
[SPEAKER_05]: It may have been on fire.

298
00:22:25,361 --> 00:22:25,641
[SPEAKER_18]: It was.

299
00:22:26,802 --> 00:22:29,382
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's what may have prompted the resolution.

300
00:22:29,422 --> 00:22:30,243
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I remember at one point.

301
00:22:30,263 --> 00:22:31,563
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, actually, it was the mess that prompted it.

302
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,483
[SPEAKER_18]: The fire was just a byproduct of that mess.

303
00:22:34,964 --> 00:22:35,084
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

304
00:22:37,158 --> 00:22:37,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Council Knight.

305
00:22:38,639 --> 00:22:39,219
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you have more?

306
00:22:39,479 --> 00:22:44,040
[SPEAKER_05]: And is the owner of the property going to take responsibility if something happens there, Mr. President?

307
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,521
[SPEAKER_05]: These are all questions that need to be answered.

308
00:22:47,662 --> 00:22:48,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

309
00:22:48,182 --> 00:22:56,404
[SPEAKER_09]: And I believe that we should probably take a look or revisit the ordinance that is currently being drafted in the ordinance subcommittee.

310
00:22:56,524 --> 00:22:58,205
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, we have a priorities meeting tomorrow night.

311
00:22:58,245 --> 00:22:59,165
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe this should be one of those.

312
00:22:59,666 --> 00:23:06,808
[SPEAKER_09]: If the council agrees, maybe this should be a priority moving forward for this session to actually draft an ordinance and pass an ordinance that would regulate these.

313
00:23:07,248 --> 00:23:08,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Regular, I'm not I'm not asking to ban.

314
00:23:08,668 --> 00:23:34,514
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm asking to regulate absolutely So so they're above board if you as a homeowner doing home improvement And you want to get a bin to empty your waste in that's heavily regulated in this community Heavily regulated and you charge for it as a homeowner But if you all of a sudden want to throw a bin in a parking lot and have it manned six days a week There's no regulations at all Doesn't make sense Thank You console marks

315
00:23:38,513 --> 00:23:39,153
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Bears.

316
00:23:39,173 --> 00:23:43,835
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to throw my hat in the ring that I haven't seen that it's manned six days a week.

317
00:23:43,895 --> 00:23:46,857
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's surprising to me because it seems to get bigger every time I see it.

318
00:23:47,017 --> 00:23:49,838
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't know if they're actually getting stuff out of there.

319
00:23:49,878 --> 00:23:58,862
[SPEAKER_12]: But I was in the parking lot 10 days ago and I was incredibly surprised at the size of the pile and the condition of it.

320
00:23:58,882 --> 00:24:01,584
[SPEAKER_12]: I agree with this motion.

321
00:24:01,624 --> 00:24:02,964
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we should draft an ordinance.

322
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:04,425
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that one specifically

323
00:24:04,999 --> 00:24:05,979
[SPEAKER_12]: maybe we should try to do something.

324
00:24:06,019 --> 00:24:12,701
[SPEAKER_12]: If there's a snowstorm that goes on a bunch of couches, I think that's an issue that somebody needs to deal with.

325
00:24:12,781 --> 00:24:19,483
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think if it's before us that we should maybe move on the Felsway one a little bit quicker, but I'm open to whatever folks think on that.

326
00:24:20,304 --> 00:24:21,204
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

327
00:24:21,224 --> 00:24:31,407
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Caraviello, as amended by Councilor Marks,

328
00:24:32,769 --> 00:24:39,854
[SPEAKER_09]: to issue a cease and desist if we do not receive a response from the building department?

329
00:24:42,036 --> 00:24:42,596
[SPEAKER_09]: On that motion.

330
00:24:42,616 --> 00:24:44,198
[SPEAKER_06]: In the plan 8 on Mr. Gabner.

331
00:24:59,927 --> 00:25:02,188
[SPEAKER_09]: On that motion, Clerk Cardavis, please call the roll.

332
00:25:03,048 --> 00:25:03,548
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Bears?

333
00:25:03,928 --> 00:25:04,048
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

334
00:25:04,989 --> 00:25:05,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Caraviello?

335
00:25:06,069 --> 00:25:06,229
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

336
00:25:06,689 --> 00:25:07,110
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight?

337
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:07,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

338
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:08,730
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Marks?

339
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:09,130
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

340
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:09,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Morell?

341
00:25:10,011 --> 00:25:10,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

342
00:25:10,771 --> 00:25:11,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli?

343
00:25:11,391 --> 00:25:11,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

344
00:25:12,091 --> 00:25:12,712
[SPEAKER_06]: President Falco?

345
00:25:12,752 --> 00:25:12,972
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

346
00:25:13,412 --> 00:25:15,553
[SPEAKER_09]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

347
00:25:15,573 --> 00:25:15,613
[SPEAKER_09]: 2-0-026.

348
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:25,871
[SPEAKER_09]: Offered by Councilor Scarpelli.

349
00:25:26,371 --> 00:25:34,435
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it resolved that the city administration report back to the city council on a timeline of when the message board located on Main Street will be removed.

350
00:25:38,337 --> 00:25:39,077
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarpelli.

351
00:25:39,697 --> 00:25:44,199
[SPEAKER_04]: I tell you what, Mr. President, the new chief of staff really works pretty quick because that's already moved.

352
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,781
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that, uh, things are happening fast.

353
00:25:48,502 --> 00:25:49,182
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um,

354
00:25:49,767 --> 00:25:51,288
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a phone call today from the neighbor.

355
00:25:52,109 --> 00:25:52,630
[SPEAKER_04]: It was nice.

356
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:54,271
[SPEAKER_04]: They tried to treat it as a Christmas ornament.

357
00:25:55,312 --> 00:25:58,055
[SPEAKER_04]: But once Christmas, the lights still bothered them.

358
00:25:58,095 --> 00:26:00,176
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's nice to see that it's finally gone.

359
00:26:01,077 --> 00:26:08,124
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a message board that read this traffic changes ahead, which everybody knows now.

360
00:26:08,144 --> 00:26:09,805
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm glad to see they moved that.

361
00:26:09,865 --> 00:26:10,866
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you, Mr. President.

362
00:26:11,447 --> 00:26:12,648
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

363
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:17,655
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Council Knight to receive and place on file, all those in favor?

364
00:26:17,815 --> 00:26:18,495
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

365
00:26:18,595 --> 00:26:20,097
[SPEAKER_09]: The paper is received and placed on file.

366
00:26:20,117 --> 00:26:36,830
[SPEAKER_09]: 20-027 offered by Councilor Scarpelli, be it resolved that the City Council request that the state entity that oversees the Felsway look into lighting improvements in the area, in the Felsway and Bradbury Street area in regard to public safety concerns.

367
00:26:39,095 --> 00:26:39,836
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli.

368
00:26:40,096 --> 00:26:40,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

369
00:26:40,917 --> 00:26:48,704
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just, you know, I know Council Marks always is the sounding board for the Middlesex area of the Felsway.

370
00:26:49,145 --> 00:26:56,832
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, we have an area that neighbors have tried to call different entities and we're getting nowhere.

371
00:26:57,493 --> 00:26:59,274
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, I did

372
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:13,683
[SPEAKER_04]: And State Representative Donato is working very hard to finalize the date with DOT and other state agencies on the meeting with Fountain Street, with the meeting with South and Main.

373
00:27:14,244 --> 00:27:20,888
[SPEAKER_04]: And the list keeps growing, so I'm just adding this along the residents in that area.

374
00:27:21,588 --> 00:27:30,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially with the winter months, the visibility and some of the sidewalks in that area really pose a real hazard.

375
00:27:30,259 --> 00:27:35,145
[SPEAKER_04]: So they really want to see if there's, I know you've seen it in a few different areas.

376
00:27:36,887 --> 00:27:38,990
[SPEAKER_04]: On Elm Street, I know that they just finally

377
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:57,326
[SPEAKER_04]: lit the underpass of 93 with new LED lights, so it's you know that they're capable so If we can get the word out to see who we can if we can ask the city Engineer or see if we can see who's who can look at that.

378
00:27:57,786 --> 00:27:58,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Randazzo.

379
00:27:58,527 --> 00:28:00,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe see if we can get that done.

380
00:28:00,829 --> 00:28:02,851
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. Thank You council sky Pelli

381
00:28:03,487 --> 00:28:06,190
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of console, Scarpelli, seconded by console of Carly yellow.

382
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:08,632
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor, all those opposed.

383
00:28:08,672 --> 00:28:14,658
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion passes petitions, presentations and similar papers.

384
00:28:14,718 --> 00:28:25,189
[SPEAKER_09]: Two zero dash zero two eight petition by Elizabeth Barber, 72 ravine road, Medford, Massachusetts, zero two one five zero two one five five to discuss the flashing signs.

385
00:28:25,269 --> 00:28:26,270
[SPEAKER_09]: Stop and slope.

386
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:33,280
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi.

387
00:28:34,241 --> 00:28:36,002
[SPEAKER_09]: Can we please have your name and address for the record?

388
00:28:36,282 --> 00:28:36,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

389
00:28:36,622 --> 00:28:38,223
[SPEAKER_07]: Elizabeth Barber, Ravine Road.

390
00:28:40,545 --> 00:28:42,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for having let me speak tonight.

391
00:28:43,367 --> 00:28:47,329
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm here to talk about the flashing signs that are going up, be installed.

392
00:28:47,349 --> 00:28:56,415
[SPEAKER_07]: And apparently at the, when I say, you know, registered for this, I didn't realize the name, RRFBs, rectangular flashing beacons.

393
00:28:56,975 --> 00:28:58,516
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically they're strobe lights.

394
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:01,358
[SPEAKER_07]: Strobe light is a flashing or flickering light.

395
00:29:01,418 --> 00:29:02,859
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what these are.

396
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:10,197
[SPEAKER_07]: And I understand the intended purpose of these is safety, but they're bright and they're flashing.

397
00:29:11,018 --> 00:29:17,966
[SPEAKER_07]: So I want to bring to your attention some of the effects that these lights can bring, you know, bring to people, cause people.

398
00:29:19,267 --> 00:29:25,694
[SPEAKER_07]: With that, keep in mind that, you know, everyone is affected with, they're very sensitive to flashing lights in a different way.

399
00:29:26,147 --> 00:29:31,128
[SPEAKER_07]: Some people more than others, some it doesn't bother, some it affects in multiple ways.

400
00:29:32,128 --> 00:29:37,569
[SPEAKER_07]: And also the timing and intensity of these lights can affect people differently as well.

401
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:49,092
[SPEAKER_07]: Exposure to these could trigger migraines, which can be debilitating if you've ever had a migraine, as well as seizures in people that are epileptic.

402
00:29:50,332 --> 00:29:55,533
[SPEAKER_07]: And exposure to these can also cause someone to feel uncomfortable, anxious,

403
00:29:56,128 --> 00:30:10,812
[SPEAKER_07]: disoriented, nauseous, dizzy, headaches, have vertigo, it's called a flicker form of vertigo, which is an imbalance in the brain cell activity caused by these flashing lights.

404
00:30:11,771 --> 00:30:13,512
[SPEAKER_07]: It could also disrupt sleep patterns.

405
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:25,759
[SPEAKER_07]: If someone's not getting enough sleep because the disease is in their neighborhoods, it's in their windows, they're not rested, they're not going to function or focus as they should be.

406
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:33,324
[SPEAKER_07]: There are also people out there that can be affected by these and don't realize it.

407
00:30:33,684 --> 00:30:38,767
[SPEAKER_07]: And they won't realize it until they have a seizure.

408
00:30:38,827 --> 00:30:41,469
[SPEAKER_07]: This is called photosensitive epilepsy.

409
00:30:42,183 --> 00:30:54,056
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're not epileptic, but these type of flashing strobe lights can bring on a seizure, which can be more common in children and adolescents.

410
00:30:55,582 --> 00:31:05,986
[SPEAKER_07]: And meeting that, that was very disturbing to me because I thought children, as you know, when they don't feel well, they really don't know what's wrong with them and they can't explain it or say why.

411
00:31:06,006 --> 00:31:14,129
[SPEAKER_07]: And something like this, if it's bothering them, they don't, they don't, they're not going to know what's going on with them or why they feel the way they do.

412
00:31:14,809 --> 00:31:16,190
[SPEAKER_07]: And so their parents aren't going to know.

413
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:20,431
[SPEAKER_07]: So they can't, it's not going to be alleviated this, you know, this problem.

414
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:21,852
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just think,

415
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,942
[SPEAKER_07]: All of these are going up and around the neighborhoods and around schools.

416
00:31:27,182 --> 00:31:31,184
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be affecting many people that you probably never thought about.

417
00:31:31,965 --> 00:31:36,367
[SPEAKER_07]: And I didn't deal until I was exposed to one and I thought, you know, what is this?

418
00:31:36,967 --> 00:31:50,134
[SPEAKER_07]: So I asked each of you, I gave up, you know, I had a packet for you to, I'm sorry, read, you know, to look at and just realize there is some true, you know, harmful effects here with these lights.

419
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,261
[SPEAKER_07]: and not just to put them up so lightly.

420
00:31:53,841 --> 00:32:04,165
[SPEAKER_07]: And I understand the attention to safety, but we also want to take care of the well-being and health of the people in the city, families, whatever.

421
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:13,388
[SPEAKER_07]: So I ask each of you to look into this seriously and to consider the negative health and wellness that these can cause.

422
00:32:15,089 --> 00:32:18,170
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm also asking because I suffer from migraines.

423
00:32:19,197 --> 00:32:20,917
[SPEAKER_07]: And the first two that I saw, they bothered me.

424
00:32:20,937 --> 00:32:22,278
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't just like, oh, I don't like them.

425
00:32:22,318 --> 00:32:23,718
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, oh, my God.

426
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:25,679
[SPEAKER_07]: This is bothering.

427
00:32:25,719 --> 00:32:31,420
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mentioned to a friend of mine who's a nurse, and she said it's the strobe light effect that will do that.

428
00:32:32,281 --> 00:32:36,342
[SPEAKER_07]: And it can also cause people to have seizures, whether they're epileptic or not.

429
00:32:36,362 --> 00:32:39,122
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's how I thought, oh, my God, something's got to be done.

430
00:32:39,262 --> 00:32:43,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I just heard today that there are more going up right around the Brooke School.

431
00:32:44,744 --> 00:32:48,385
[SPEAKER_07]: So people will say that doesn't bother me.

432
00:32:49,046 --> 00:32:52,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe not you, but other people will be affected by these.

433
00:32:52,988 --> 00:33:04,915
[SPEAKER_07]: So I ask that you seriously look into this, read these other information you might, you know, you think you need to deal with this.

434
00:33:04,996 --> 00:33:05,736
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd appreciate it.

435
00:33:06,036 --> 00:33:07,177
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm sure other people would too.

436
00:33:08,758 --> 00:33:09,058
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

437
00:33:09,431 --> 00:33:10,192
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Ms.

438
00:33:10,213 --> 00:33:13,719
[SPEAKER_09]: Barber, thank you very much for coming forward tonight, and thank you for all the materials.

439
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:17,145
[SPEAKER_09]: It's always good to have some backup information, so we appreciate that.

440
00:33:17,346 --> 00:33:20,071
[SPEAKER_09]: There are a number of councilors, I believe, that want to comment on this.

441
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:21,994
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll start off with Councilor Bears.

442
00:33:22,773 --> 00:33:24,395
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to thank you for bringing this forward.

443
00:33:25,435 --> 00:33:26,997
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm kind of an interesting position on this.

444
00:33:27,137 --> 00:33:30,040
[SPEAKER_12]: My before I was born my aunt passed away from epilepsy.

445
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,001
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have that.

446
00:33:31,061 --> 00:33:34,444
[SPEAKER_12]: But I've also had a very close friend who passed away in a pedestrian accident.

447
00:33:34,924 --> 00:33:36,686
[SPEAKER_12]: So kind of trying to think that through.

448
00:33:36,726 --> 00:33:38,207
[SPEAKER_12]: But I really appreciate you bringing this.

449
00:33:38,247 --> 00:33:39,489
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to take a hard look at it.

450
00:33:39,909 --> 00:33:42,411
[SPEAKER_12]: It's meaningful to me on all fronts.

451
00:33:42,792 --> 00:33:42,932
[SPEAKER_12]: And

452
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:49,713
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think just having the research, doing the research, having the conversation is really important.

453
00:33:49,753 --> 00:33:50,753
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you for bringing it forward.

454
00:33:50,773 --> 00:33:51,354
[SPEAKER_07]: You're very welcome.

455
00:33:51,374 --> 00:33:51,754
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate that.

456
00:33:51,794 --> 00:34:02,360
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know, another thing I didn't mention, and I don't know the politically correct term as my daughter was saying, that's not the correct, children are people on the spectrum.

457
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:06,563
[SPEAKER_07]: Autism, I guess this whole blank thing, they're greatly affected by

458
00:34:07,302 --> 00:34:17,426
[SPEAKER_07]: They're very sensitive to things, more so than any of us, and these things could just really, you know, affect them, trigger them into a behavior that will just spiral.

459
00:34:17,466 --> 00:34:22,248
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, there's so much more out there than just, you know, the safety.

460
00:34:22,288 --> 00:34:29,270
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got to look at health-wise as well as, you know, just people crossing in cars and slowing down.

461
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:30,310
[SPEAKER_07]: There's more to it as well.

462
00:34:31,971 --> 00:34:32,331
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

463
00:34:32,611 --> 00:34:33,512
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

464
00:34:38,597 --> 00:34:39,237
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

465
00:34:40,458 --> 00:34:41,278
[SPEAKER_16]: When Ms.

466
00:34:41,298 --> 00:34:44,579
[SPEAKER_16]: Barber called me last week on this, I did a little bit of work on it.

467
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:48,620
[SPEAKER_16]: And I never knew about the issue until you brought it to my attention.

468
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:49,241
[SPEAKER_16]: I thank you for that.

469
00:34:50,401 --> 00:35:01,624
[SPEAKER_16]: But it says that people that have problems usually get lights that flash between three and 30 flashes per second.

470
00:35:02,405 --> 00:35:02,865
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

471
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,903
[SPEAKER_16]: how many flashes our lights flash in the same method.

472
00:35:07,263 --> 00:35:16,273
[SPEAKER_16]: But I think that'd be something maybe our traffic engineer could look at to see what the flashes per second is.

473
00:35:16,633 --> 00:35:23,280
[SPEAKER_16]: But it also says that Christmas lights and lights that don't cause a problem,

474
00:35:26,104 --> 00:35:37,255
[SPEAKER_16]: They do one flash per second, which is very low, and it poses a very little risk for people that have issues.

475
00:35:37,275 --> 00:35:38,216
[SPEAKER_16]: So like I said, I don't know.

476
00:35:38,456 --> 00:35:41,819
[SPEAKER_07]: No, and I realize that, and I thought that too, because I thought Christmas lights, I thought.

477
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,221
[SPEAKER_07]: Those bother me.

478
00:35:43,361 --> 00:35:46,624
[SPEAKER_07]: I couldn't have lights that flicker.

479
00:35:46,704 --> 00:35:50,388
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank God my neighbors don't, because that would put me over the edge.

480
00:35:50,408 --> 00:35:52,330
[SPEAKER_16]: But I say, I don't know what our speed is and our lights.

481
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:55,032
[SPEAKER_07]: But at least, I mean, with Christmas, you know they're up and they're done.

482
00:35:55,093 --> 00:35:57,495
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can try to protect yourself or your child.

483
00:35:57,835 --> 00:36:02,020
[SPEAKER_07]: But these that are going up and around, it's like you can't drive here, you can't go there if you're in the bedroom.

484
00:36:02,481 --> 00:36:03,582
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean, this just adds to it.

485
00:36:03,602 --> 00:36:10,751
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got Christmas lights, you've got the police lights, you've got the fire trucks, you've got the lights at railroad tracking.

486
00:36:10,791 --> 00:36:15,456
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like there are already so many flashing lights that can trigger problems for people.

487
00:36:15,817 --> 00:36:17,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Why add to it?

488
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:29,870
[SPEAKER_07]: I know we can, there are other safety alternatives for crosswalks and for things for people to slow down and be aware of pedestrians that I just think we're putting, why put more harmful things out there.

489
00:36:30,791 --> 00:36:36,416
[SPEAKER_07]: And there was one article here that, this one about the college in Alabama, and they mentioned

490
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:44,883
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, the flashing and how many, but it says it doesn't matter because these affect people in different ways at different levels and strengths.

491
00:36:45,563 --> 00:36:48,825
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, they might say the study, yeah, but it still does affect people.

492
00:36:49,565 --> 00:36:58,189
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, I take the risk of affecting someone's health when I believe there's other alternatives to safety.

493
00:36:59,991 --> 00:37:09,362
[SPEAKER_16]: But in the meantime, if we could have either the electrical department or the traffic engineer look into how fast the eyes are flashing.

494
00:37:09,963 --> 00:37:19,174
[SPEAKER_16]: And if they are flashing more than that one per second, if they can lower it to at least get it down until the meantime, until we figure out what we want to do with these lights.

495
00:37:19,495 --> 00:37:21,676
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, because it really bothered me.

496
00:37:21,696 --> 00:37:23,417
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, this isn't just like I don't like it.

497
00:37:23,437 --> 00:37:24,577
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, this is bothering me.

498
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:25,357
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought, oh my god.

499
00:37:25,877 --> 00:37:26,898
[SPEAKER_07]: This is going up all over.

500
00:37:26,938 --> 00:37:28,879
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to have, you know, I get a migraine.

501
00:37:28,919 --> 00:37:29,979
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm in bed for three days.

502
00:37:30,059 --> 00:37:31,760
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean, it's debilitating.

503
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,440
[SPEAKER_07]: Other people get sick and vomit.

504
00:37:34,221 --> 00:37:35,681
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's just headache, migraines.

505
00:37:35,761 --> 00:37:38,402
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there's so many other issues it could cause.

506
00:37:39,183 --> 00:37:44,565
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just wanted you all to be aware of that, because I know more are going up every day.

507
00:37:44,825 --> 00:37:45,645
[SPEAKER_07]: And I walk a lot.

508
00:37:46,085 --> 00:37:46,566
[SPEAKER_07]: And I see them.

509
00:37:46,606 --> 00:37:46,966
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, yo.

510
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:49,555
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, I thank you for bringing this to my attention.

511
00:37:49,575 --> 00:37:51,739
[SPEAKER_16]: Like I said, I never knew about till you called me.

512
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,182
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

513
00:37:53,202 --> 00:37:53,643
[SPEAKER_09]: Appreciate it.

514
00:37:54,548 --> 00:37:54,828
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

515
00:37:54,868 --> 00:38:03,154
[SPEAKER_16]: So, Councilor Caraviello, your motion is that the traffic engineer- Or the electrical department find out what rate our lights are flickering at.

516
00:38:03,995 --> 00:38:22,489
[SPEAKER_16]: And if they are at that high, until we figure out what the city's going to do with them, if they can at least get it down to that one flash per second, which the Epilepsy Foundation says is probably the lowest it could be without causing the least amount of harm to somebody.

517
00:38:22,849 --> 00:38:24,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, no, it's a start.

518
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:28,631
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I just think it's very difficult.

519
00:38:29,772 --> 00:38:33,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Very difficult to have these up and, you know, you get to drive through the city, you can't avoid them.

520
00:38:35,254 --> 00:38:40,716
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of council, Caraviello is seconded by Councilor Knight.

521
00:38:42,937 --> 00:38:43,437
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

522
00:38:44,597 --> 00:38:45,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

523
00:38:46,638 --> 00:38:47,678
[SPEAKER_02]: And Ms.

524
00:38:47,718 --> 00:38:48,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Barber, thank you for bringing this up.

525
00:38:48,939 --> 00:38:51,520
[SPEAKER_02]: We appreciate you coming up here this evening, taking time out of your busy schedule.

526
00:38:52,873 --> 00:39:02,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, all signage on any roadway needs to be in compliance with the federal standard that's established through the manual and uniform traffic control devices.

527
00:39:03,166 --> 00:39:09,413
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think, first and foremost, what we should do is take a look and make sure that these rapid flashing beacon lights that we have here in the community comply.

528
00:39:10,234 --> 00:39:12,096
[SPEAKER_02]: with the manual.

529
00:39:12,156 --> 00:39:20,464
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd ask that the paper be referred to the city engineer for a report back as to whether or not these rapid flashing beacons are in compliance with the manual and uniform traffic control devices.

530
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:22,526
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're not, then we have an answer right there.

531
00:39:22,566 --> 00:39:23,988
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not in compliance, they have to come down.

532
00:39:31,075 --> 00:39:31,936
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

533
00:39:33,397 --> 00:39:33,978
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Morell.

534
00:39:35,113 --> 00:39:53,329
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you miss Barbara for for raising this to us something I hadn't even thought of before and I echo Councilors caraballo and night and just understanding Whether we're in compliance and and even just seeing checking with the traffic engineer what kind of control we have over these lights as far as the how fast they flash and

535
00:39:53,776 --> 00:40:00,561
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm a big proponent of pedestrian safety, and I do wholly support other measures like raised crosswalks and things like that.

536
00:40:00,721 --> 00:40:10,929
[SPEAKER_15]: But in the efforts of just getting this done and getting this up faster, I understand that these flashing lights are really what we can do now and what we can get out for pedestrian safety.

537
00:40:10,989 --> 00:40:19,175
[SPEAKER_15]: So just thank you for raising that and understanding the balance we have to play as far as considering all aspects in something like this.

538
00:40:19,435 --> 00:40:19,876
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you.

539
00:40:20,365 --> 00:40:20,885
[SPEAKER_07]: You're welcome.

540
00:40:21,005 --> 00:40:31,053
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, I think my concern is they're going to go up and it's going to be like, all right, they're up and we're going to have to deal with these and suffer, you know, physical consequences.

541
00:40:31,273 --> 00:40:36,737
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, you know, I don't think that we should have to, you know, just because we have them and they're up.

542
00:40:37,458 --> 00:40:41,281
[SPEAKER_07]: So it would be nice to see that something's actually done if they're up temporarily or whatever.

543
00:40:41,321 --> 00:40:49,507
[SPEAKER_07]: But, um, I would hate to think that these, you know, because they're up, they're up and they've got to stay put because we all know that doesn't necessarily have to be the case.

544
00:40:51,352 --> 00:40:53,833
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Council Member Earle.

545
00:40:53,953 --> 00:40:54,793
[SPEAKER_09]: Your question, sure.

546
00:40:55,533 --> 00:40:57,354
[SPEAKER_00]: If we could just have your name and address for the record, please.

547
00:40:57,374 --> 00:41:01,796
[SPEAKER_00]: Lauren Boudreau, and I live in Winchester, but my mother lives in Medford.

548
00:41:01,836 --> 00:41:06,837
[SPEAKER_00]: And I happen to be walking near the senior center because I bring my mother there often.

549
00:41:07,437 --> 00:41:12,579
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ring road has installed two of these flashing lights.

550
00:41:13,159 --> 00:41:16,501
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I've observed is they alternate.

551
00:41:16,541 --> 00:41:20,722
[SPEAKER_00]: So one sign might be that under the number that you were epilepsy.

552
00:41:21,216 --> 00:41:22,236
[SPEAKER_00]: Foundation recommends.

553
00:41:22,296 --> 00:41:25,617
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other sign is going in opposition to it.

554
00:41:26,238 --> 00:41:33,180
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just stood there and watched, because knowing that this issue was going to come before you, I just observed like 10 cars go through.

555
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:36,961
[SPEAKER_00]: And nine out of the 12, I think there were eight, nine cars.

556
00:41:37,021 --> 00:41:39,341
[SPEAKER_00]: And eight of the nine cars didn't slow down at all.

557
00:41:39,762 --> 00:41:40,922
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's right here at the ring road.

558
00:41:40,942 --> 00:41:42,142
[SPEAKER_00]: You can stand there and look at it.

559
00:41:42,883 --> 00:41:48,824
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it made me wonder whether this is the most efficient way to get

560
00:41:52,168 --> 00:41:55,890
[SPEAKER_00]: driver's attention to slow down at pedestrian crosswalks.

561
00:41:56,511 --> 00:42:13,581
[SPEAKER_00]: I know in Winchester we have blinking signs, which I think are, I'm not sure if they're in compliance with the epilepsy guidelines, but they inform you of your speed, and that gets me to slow down, so I hope that less

562
00:42:16,024 --> 00:42:17,766
[SPEAKER_00]: lesser measures might have been considered.

563
00:42:17,786 --> 00:42:25,815
[SPEAKER_00]: Like also the crosswalk here on the ring road with the two signs on opposite sides that are kind of going alternating light patterns.

564
00:42:27,176 --> 00:42:30,180
[SPEAKER_00]: The crosswalk could just be repainted because it's really faded.

565
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:34,545
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's to me a very low budget way of addressing the situation.

566
00:42:35,773 --> 00:42:36,654
[SPEAKER_00]: just my observation.

567
00:42:36,774 --> 00:42:38,795
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, that caused me to go home and look at the literature.

568
00:42:38,836 --> 00:42:40,057
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's lots of literature.

569
00:42:40,077 --> 00:42:42,659
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a nationwide study that's available.

570
00:42:42,859 --> 00:42:44,860
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was the 2017 study.

571
00:42:45,861 --> 00:42:48,523
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't get to read it.

572
00:42:48,603 --> 00:42:50,865
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like over 191 pages.

573
00:42:51,286 --> 00:43:05,017
[SPEAKER_00]: So page 148 and 191, I can send it to you if you're interested, specifically discuss the issue of the pattern of the lights and how it can be not only a distraction,

574
00:43:05,662 --> 00:43:17,411
[SPEAKER_00]: but a trigger for epilepsy, migraines, people that are on the spectrum that might have hypersensitivity to stimulation.

575
00:43:19,652 --> 00:43:20,233
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

576
00:43:20,253 --> 00:43:24,396
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

577
00:43:24,416 --> 00:43:26,498
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Caraviello offered a resolution.

578
00:43:26,518 --> 00:43:33,643
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight, did you want to move the original petition or did you want to move the Councilor Caraviello's

579
00:43:34,582 --> 00:43:42,107
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so on the original petition that it be referred to the traffic engineer, city engineer, my apologies.

580
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:50,532
[SPEAKER_09]: On that motion, seconded by Councilor Bears.

[SPEAKER_09]: The motion passes.

588
00:44:07,684 --> 00:44:21,794
[SPEAKER_09]: Reports of committees 1 9-6 5 9 December 17 2019 committee the whole report that was See there was a committee the whole report on Tuesday December 17 2019 at 6 p.m.

589
00:44:21,855 --> 00:44:22,175
[SPEAKER_09]: That was the

590
00:44:28,258 --> 00:44:41,324
[SPEAKER_09]: The report was basically a presentation by City Solicitor Rumley to give an overview of the efforts to date regarding crafting an ordinance regarding marijuana.

591
00:44:43,625 --> 00:44:49,168
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

592

[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Caraviello to take papers in the hands of the clerk.

596
00:45:04,997 --> 00:45:05,738
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

597
00:45:06,178 --> 00:45:06,779
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

[SPEAKER_09]: The motion passes.

599
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:14,746
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, 20-029.

600
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:34,704
[SPEAKER_09]: Offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the City Administration provide the Medford City Council with a cost estimate for the resurfacing of Golden Avenue between Willis Avenue and Main Street.

601
00:45:35,104 --> 00:45:39,846
[SPEAKER_09]: It be it further resolved that the City Administration issue an RFP to complete this project.

602
00:45:44,128 --> 00:45:44,608
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight.

603
00:45:44,828 --> 00:45:46,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

604
00:45:46,669 --> 00:45:47,169
[SPEAKER_02]: The patching

605
00:45:48,137 --> 00:45:50,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Along Golden Ave is no longer effective.

606
00:45:50,479 --> 00:45:54,923
[SPEAKER_02]: This roadway is probably one of the busier thoroughfares in the community.

607
00:45:55,503 --> 00:45:57,925
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very well known cut through street.

608
00:45:58,746 --> 00:46:06,452
[SPEAKER_02]: If we had a traffic study up on Murray Hill Road that said 28,000 cars a week travel up that street, then I'm going to say that 90,000 travel up Golden Avenue.

609
00:46:07,093 --> 00:46:09,516
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a notorious cut through for Mystic Avenue, Mr. President.

610
00:46:09,536 --> 00:46:12,660
[SPEAKER_02]: We all know everybody goes up Golden Avenue to avoid the lights at Harvard Street.

611
00:46:13,582 --> 00:46:23,335
[SPEAKER_02]: But what's happened is due to the high volume of traffic on the roadway and years and years of neglected mismaintenance on the road, we're now at a spot where any time a snowplow goes up and down the street,

612
00:46:23,855 --> 00:46:25,076
[SPEAKER_02]: the street gets torn to shreds.

613
00:46:25,877 --> 00:46:29,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the crew will come in, and the crew will come in and patch it, and the patch will last for a little while.

614
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:33,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Next snowstorm comes, street gets torn to shreds again.

615
00:46:33,602 --> 00:46:36,884
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very similar to the situation that we saw down on Paris Street a couple of years ago.

616
00:46:37,404 --> 00:46:38,585
[SPEAKER_02]: The rip rock is coming up.

617
00:46:39,205 --> 00:46:42,808
[SPEAKER_02]: When cars drive up the street and this rip rock is exposed, it shoots all over the place.

618
00:46:42,868 --> 00:46:43,769
[SPEAKER_02]: It damages vehicles.

619
00:46:44,469 --> 00:46:47,391
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just time that the roadway be resurfaced, Mr. President.

620
00:46:47,871 --> 00:47:10,788
[SPEAKER_09]: So with that being said I'd ask my council colleagues to support the resolution and hopefully we can move forward and get Golden Avenue resurfaced for the residents Thank You console night on the motion of Council night seconded by Council beers all those in favor I suppose the motion passes While we're under suspension to 0-0 3-0 offered by console night be it resolved at the Medford City Council request that the Zamboni and Makati ranked be replaced

621
00:47:11,544 --> 00:47:12,424
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

622
00:47:12,464 --> 00:47:13,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

623
00:47:14,105 --> 00:47:20,707
[SPEAKER_02]: The Zamboni at La Conte Rink has been named in memory of my dear friend, I dear friend, the late John Welch.

624
00:47:21,367 --> 00:47:24,788
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Zamboni has seen better days, Mr. President.

625
00:47:25,108 --> 00:47:27,429
[SPEAKER_02]: I might have to put it out there.

626
00:47:27,449 --> 00:47:29,530
[SPEAKER_02]: I might be the only councilor who knows how to drive a Zamboni.

627
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:32,311
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

628
00:47:32,371 --> 00:47:33,991
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have to have a contest.

629
00:47:36,873 --> 00:47:44,956
[SPEAKER_02]: But having worked out at the hockey rink, having driven that Zamboni that's down there now, having worked alongside John Welch, it's safe to say that this Zamboni has seen better days.

630
00:47:45,596 --> 00:47:47,576
[SPEAKER_02]: In certain instances, it is inoperational.

631
00:47:47,817 --> 00:47:53,738
[SPEAKER_02]: And when the Zamboni is inoperational, then what the city does is we call the DCR and we beg, can you please send us a Zamboni?

632
00:47:53,758 --> 00:47:54,879
[SPEAKER_02]: The one that we have doesn't work.

633
00:47:55,139 --> 00:47:58,240
[SPEAKER_02]: And if that doesn't work, then we go to neighboring communities and we ask to borrow theirs.

634
00:47:58,981 --> 00:48:07,169
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I saw Councilor Scarpelli driving down Mystic Ave and Somerville Zamboni actually two years ago to drop it off when ours was inoperational.

635
00:48:08,029 --> 00:48:11,953
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I'm thinking, Mr. President, is we make the investment now in a new Zamboni.

636
00:48:12,013 --> 00:48:14,616
[SPEAKER_02]: We keep the old Zamboni and we use that as a spare.

637
00:48:15,036 --> 00:48:19,360
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we come into a circumstance where the current one we're using doesn't work, we have a spare.

638
00:48:19,561 --> 00:48:21,823
[SPEAKER_02]: And if other communities need help, we have one to loan out.

639
00:48:22,663 --> 00:48:40,668
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a very minor investment to make but the impact when the Zamboni goes down is devastating you know, everyone knows what hockey is like in the city of Medford and if there's a Cancellation of ice time because the Zamboni is not working I think that that's a problem with us and that's something that we can avoid by making the small investment So I'd ask my council colleagues to support it

640
00:48:41,448 --> 00:48:42,389
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

641
00:48:42,449 --> 00:48:43,890
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarpelli.

642
00:48:43,970 --> 00:48:45,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Falco.

643
00:48:45,211 --> 00:48:57,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to shed a little light, I know this is part of my job duties and what people don't realize is that if there isn't a contingency plan in place, it takes up to three years to build a Zamboni.

644
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:00,242
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we had to do

645
00:49:00,982 --> 00:49:05,925
[SPEAKER_04]: in the neighborhood community that I work in, you don't realize the trickle down effect.

646
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:08,607
[SPEAKER_04]: It costs a lot of money to run rinks.

647
00:49:09,287 --> 00:49:19,673
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's vital that every minute that you can sell that ice so our youth programs can use that facility is important.

648
00:49:20,133 --> 00:49:29,639
[SPEAKER_04]: So the idea of not having the Zamboni, I know that Councilor Knight, there's a rental, there's an emergency one that DCR has, but that's usually,

649
00:49:30,682 --> 00:49:34,848
[SPEAKER_04]: either taken by another community and it's tough to find.

650
00:49:34,928 --> 00:49:44,661
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know that in the past what we've done is we actually reach out to the Boston Bruins and it's something that we might look into that every two years they turn over, they have three Zambonis.

651
00:49:45,565 --> 00:49:47,246
[SPEAKER_04]: So they turn over their three every two years.

652
00:49:47,306 --> 00:49:58,252
[SPEAKER_04]: So it might be prudent to look into reaching out to the Boston Bruins in the garden to ask them if one is going to be available soon.

653
00:49:58,272 --> 00:50:03,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it is an expensive piece, but you can't trade off

654
00:50:04,023 --> 00:50:07,205
[SPEAKER_04]: The idea of Zamboni goes down for a month.

655
00:50:07,886 --> 00:50:18,975
[SPEAKER_04]: What you lose, not just in your participation for your kids and the residents in the community, but the lack of revenue that is vital to make sure that you have the funding to keep that rink alive.

656
00:50:19,115 --> 00:50:25,279
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a very tricky combination.

657
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:30,343
[SPEAKER_04]: So I support Councilor Knight's recommendation with the Zamboni.

658
00:50:30,383 --> 00:50:30,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

659
00:50:30,964 --> 00:50:32,145
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Scarapelli.

660
00:50:32,992 --> 00:50:33,352
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Caraviello.

661
00:50:33,372 --> 00:50:33,833
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you Mr. President.

662
00:50:35,414 --> 00:50:43,902
[SPEAKER_16]: Being involved with Medford Hockey for many years, this is probably the second most important piece of equipment in the building besides the refrigeration unit.

663
00:50:44,563 --> 00:50:48,587
[SPEAKER_16]: And if that goes down, nothing happens in that building.

664
00:50:49,027 --> 00:50:54,272
[SPEAKER_16]: I've been there at times where the thing's gone down for days at a time and it causes havoc.

665
00:50:54,831 --> 00:51:04,839
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, rescheduling, planning to put teams and high school teams, other teams that, you know, to find places until back in those days, the MDC got us one from another rink.

666
00:51:04,919 --> 00:51:10,203
[SPEAKER_16]: So this is something that should be done quicker than later.

667
00:51:10,223 --> 00:51:13,806
[SPEAKER_16]: If we have to maybe, if we search the market, maybe we can find a decent used one.

668
00:51:14,406 --> 00:51:17,869
[SPEAKER_16]: I guess from the Bruins or some, maybe one of the, a lot of the universities all have rinks.

669
00:51:17,909 --> 00:51:21,732
[SPEAKER_16]: So again, this is something that can't be let go because

670
00:51:23,299 --> 00:51:31,504
[SPEAKER_16]: This is a very, very busy entity and to lose a week because of no Zamboni would be treacherous.

671
00:51:31,524 --> 00:51:37,327
[SPEAKER_16]: So I support Councilor Knight's motion and see if we can't buy a new one.

672
00:51:38,328 --> 00:51:41,610
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe we can find a good used one from one of the universities or anything.

673
00:51:42,857 --> 00:51:43,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

674
00:51:44,198 --> 00:51:45,400
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Bears.

675
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:46,721
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

676
00:51:46,841 --> 00:51:51,186
[SPEAKER_12]: And more of a point of information than anything else, but I'm strongly supportive of this.

677
00:51:51,546 --> 00:51:54,609
[SPEAKER_12]: I know how important La Conte is to so many families and people in the city.

678
00:51:55,049 --> 00:51:59,995
[SPEAKER_12]: Just for my edification, since you guys seem like experts, do you know how long the current Zamboni's been?

679
00:52:00,135 --> 00:52:02,237
[SPEAKER_12]: We've had that one a while.

680
00:52:04,719 --> 00:52:06,201
[SPEAKER_12]: OK, so like double my life.

681
00:52:07,906 --> 00:52:08,387
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

682
00:52:08,407 --> 00:52:08,387
22.

683
00:52:08,447 --> 00:52:08,787
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

684
00:52:09,088 --> 00:52:13,613
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, and then, uh, any estimate, you know, used or new, how much a new one might cost?

685
00:52:14,535 --> 00:52:14,935
[SPEAKER_12]: No idea.

686
00:52:15,095 --> 00:52:16,838
[SPEAKER_12]: It's close between 80 and 120,000.

687
00:52:16,878 --> 00:52:19,421
[SPEAKER_12]: Depends what you want to add to it.

688
00:52:20,202 --> 00:52:20,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

689
00:52:21,163 --> 00:52:21,684
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

690
00:52:22,985 --> 00:52:23,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey.

691
00:52:24,167 --> 00:52:24,427
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

692
00:52:25,585 --> 00:52:26,646
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

693
00:52:26,666 --> 00:52:28,148
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli.

694
00:52:28,188 --> 00:52:36,156
[SPEAKER_04]: If I can, if you just, if we can amend that, I know that I think the contract is found the ground that works for the rank that oversees the Zamboni.

695
00:52:36,816 --> 00:52:45,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe if we can ask him to do an assessment to really show us.

696
00:52:46,596 --> 00:52:49,958
[SPEAKER_04]: how much time we have left on this yet morning to give us an estimate.

697
00:52:49,978 --> 00:52:55,622
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, he says we can survive using bits and pieces.

698
00:52:55,642 --> 00:53:00,566
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, maybe the last three years it might be something we can take a little bit later.

699
00:53:00,586 --> 00:53:01,286
[SPEAKER_04]: But I highly doubt that.

700
00:53:02,027 --> 00:53:09,012
[SPEAKER_04]: But at least that will give us the information needed to make a sound decision if it does come in front of us.

701
00:53:09,032 --> 00:53:09,492
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you.

702
00:53:09,532 --> 00:53:13,715
[SPEAKER_09]: Consul Scarpelli, do you know the name of the person, the name of the person you just mentioned, I believe?

703
00:53:14,336 --> 00:53:15,797
[SPEAKER_04]: The company is called Farmer Brown.

704
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:17,170
[SPEAKER_09]: Farmer Brown.

705
00:53:19,972 --> 00:53:20,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't laugh.

706
00:53:20,952 --> 00:53:24,294
[SPEAKER_04]: He monopolizes Zamboni's Council night.

707
00:53:25,374 --> 00:53:26,435
[SPEAKER_04]: I rest my case, Mr. President.

708
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:26,935
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

709
00:53:26,955 --> 00:53:27,515
[SPEAKER_15]: Council night.

710
00:53:28,516 --> 00:53:29,216
[SPEAKER_15]: Council of Morell.

711
00:53:29,696 --> 00:53:30,497
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

712
00:53:30,937 --> 00:53:35,319
[SPEAKER_15]: Just another question about Zamboni's as far as what the lifeline lifetime is on these.

713
00:53:37,807 --> 00:53:40,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, what the manufacturer might say.

714
00:53:51,141 --> 00:53:54,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Point of information, it's based on hours too, how many hours the machine works.

715
00:53:54,342 --> 00:53:55,183
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why it works.

716
00:53:55,803 --> 00:54:00,605
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it also depends on, our first issue was the batteries.

717
00:54:02,245 --> 00:54:05,226
[SPEAKER_04]: The batteries went on our first Zamboni, that cost the city $25,000.

718
00:54:05,306 --> 00:54:10,568
[SPEAKER_04]: We had to pay that instead of buying the used one that we ended up buying for $60,000.

719
00:54:10,608 --> 00:54:12,889
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was sort of a waste.

720
00:54:12,969 --> 00:54:15,110
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why thinking ahead is a great idea.

721
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:15,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

722
00:54:16,871 --> 00:54:17,111
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

723
00:54:19,761 --> 00:54:20,521
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight.

724
00:54:20,561 --> 00:54:29,786
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's also important to point out that these cell batteries that we use in the Zamboni, when they've reached the end of their shelf life, they need to be disposed of properly.

725
00:54:29,846 --> 00:54:31,186
[SPEAKER_02]: They are hazardous material.

726
00:54:31,486 --> 00:54:41,731
[SPEAKER_02]: And as we see the Zamboni age, we are seeing the shelf life of the batteries become shorter and the exposure of these hazardous materials in the ring become a greater increase.

727
00:54:42,691 --> 00:54:43,432
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

728
00:54:44,506 --> 00:54:48,908
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Caraviello, as amended by Councilor Scarpelli.

729
00:54:48,988 --> 00:54:49,689
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

730
00:54:49,709 --> 00:54:49,949
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

731
00:54:50,169 --> 00:54:50,969
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

732
00:54:51,129 --> 00:54:51,930
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion passes.

733
00:55:01,355 --> 00:55:02,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli.

734
00:55:02,275 --> 00:55:07,338
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we have two more items, but I know we have a constituent that wanted to speak about a concern.

735
00:55:08,379 --> 00:55:19,828
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay on the motion of contest Scarpelli to suspend the rules to have a citizen speak seconded by concert caviello all those in favor All those opposed the rules are suspended if we could please have your name and address for the record

736
00:55:20,312 --> 00:55:21,292
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, I'm Chris lamb.

737
00:55:21,392 --> 00:55:22,653
[SPEAKER_01]: I live at 69 South Street.

738
00:55:23,393 --> 00:55:34,178
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand that a resolution was passed last week to push the state to have the intersection at South Street and main have more information on lights there.

739
00:55:34,778 --> 00:55:39,120
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to again raise concerns about the amount of traffic and the speed of traffic.

740
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:54,318
[SPEAKER_01]: on South Street and I would like to that we have cars going by 50 60 miles an hour at night sometimes and during the day it's thousands of cars most of them going over 30 sometimes 40 miles an hour whenever the speed limit is 25 and I'd like to request again.

741
00:55:55,111 --> 00:56:11,273
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe not speed bumps, I know there was a problem for snow plows, but stop signs at Toro Avenue and at Walnut to slow down that traffic, maybe encourage some of the traffic to instead of going down our neighborhood street, go down Mystic Valley Parkway instead where it belongs.

742
00:56:13,002 --> 00:56:15,426
[SPEAKER_01]: The second concern I have is the amount of trucking.

743
00:56:15,566 --> 00:56:20,172
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand this is the trucking zone through our neighborhood, which is not ideal.

744
00:56:20,513 --> 00:56:21,574
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a neighborhood street.

745
00:56:22,035 --> 00:56:24,638
[SPEAKER_01]: The trucks are loud.

746
00:56:25,179 --> 00:56:27,663
[SPEAKER_01]: They shake our foundations of our houses, literally.

747
00:56:28,723 --> 00:56:31,525
[SPEAKER_01]: and they really don't belong on neighborhood streets.

748
00:56:33,006 --> 00:56:41,291
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe personally that these trucks go down South Street to the intersection in question and then go through it to get on 16 and 95.

749
00:56:41,891 --> 00:56:43,953
[SPEAKER_01]: These trucks belong on Mystic Valley Parkway.

750
00:56:44,093 --> 00:56:55,300
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's probably a problem with the state on that too where it has to be gone through the proper channels, but if at all possible, I would really like to push for that, having the truck route

751
00:56:56,220 --> 00:56:58,501
[SPEAKER_01]: re-routed.

752
00:56:58,741 --> 00:57:09,445
[SPEAKER_01]: Even when they go slow, they're very disturbing to the neighborhood and a lot of times these vehicles go quite fast, especially like the city buses that blow through our neighborhood very fast.

753
00:57:09,865 --> 00:57:15,287
[SPEAKER_01]: They make a lot of noise, they're dangerous, and they're very disruptive to our neighborhood.

754
00:57:16,167 --> 00:57:25,190
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for following up with the state, but the stoplight at the end of the road, there's other problems as well with the traffic itself.

755
00:57:26,334 --> 00:57:26,835
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

756
00:57:26,855 --> 00:57:27,836
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for coming down tonight.

757
00:57:27,856 --> 00:57:28,556
[SPEAKER_09]: We appreciate it.

758
00:57:29,197 --> 00:57:30,038
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli.

759
00:57:30,438 --> 00:57:30,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

760
00:57:30,779 --> 00:57:42,491
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that to be honest, I was so naive when I became the chairperson of transportation and we had the state in to discuss this and it was so positive.

761
00:57:42,932 --> 00:57:45,615
[SPEAKER_04]: And I came back and I said, everything's going to be taken care of within a month.

762
00:57:46,616 --> 00:57:47,737
[SPEAKER_04]: That was eight months ago.

763
00:57:48,514 --> 00:57:57,497
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can tell you something, I've gotten more phone calls and more issues with that area than anything I've dealt with in four years as a city councilor.

764
00:57:58,237 --> 00:58:01,999
[SPEAKER_04]: It is so dangerous, not only for the people that live in the area, the pedestrians.

765
00:58:02,599 --> 00:58:05,160
[SPEAKER_04]: I told you, it's like when we were kids, we played Frogger.

766
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,261
[SPEAKER_04]: That's exactly, it's a video game.

767
00:58:07,761 --> 00:58:10,402
[SPEAKER_04]: People go across that and your life is in your hands.

768
00:58:11,062 --> 00:58:20,125
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know that there are some things that we said we will wait for the state, but I think that, I know that Council Marks brought it up last week.

769
00:58:21,046 --> 00:58:22,206
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a major accident.

770
00:58:22,286 --> 00:58:31,470
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I'd like to do, I know that if we can, I'd like to send a report over to Chief Buckley and the mayor.

771
00:58:33,170 --> 00:58:34,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the things they said were low-hanging fruit.

772
00:58:35,471 --> 00:58:42,593
[SPEAKER_04]: were those stop signs on Toro, Butler, and the raised sidewalk on that side.

773
00:58:42,953 --> 00:58:47,394
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that if we can do that right now, that's something we can control as a city.

774
00:58:47,874 --> 00:58:50,995
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we should move on that as soon as possible.

775
00:58:51,055 --> 00:59:02,257
[SPEAKER_04]: And I recommend that we direct the chief and we offer the mayor to please push that along to make sure that that issue is at least being heard.

776
00:59:02,297 --> 00:59:04,878
[SPEAKER_04]: I think one of the biggest things is if you see some change,

777
00:59:05,758 --> 00:59:09,660
[SPEAKER_04]: at least residents feel like, okay, that they're being supported.

778
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:21,086
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that the other piece is the people that are driving those routes or walking those routes or riding their bikes in those routes are saying that it's more of a comfortable area and they have to slow down.

779
00:59:21,126 --> 00:59:22,527
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it's important, it's imperative.

780
00:59:22,927 --> 00:59:31,451
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know, listen, Representative Donato, I've talked to him in the last 10 days, a hundred times, and he has been pushing.

781
00:59:31,491 --> 00:59:34,493
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been very frustrating for him, especially as a state delegate,

782
00:59:36,849 --> 00:59:39,472
[SPEAKER_04]: The conversation was the new year, was the holidays.

783
00:59:40,193 --> 00:59:42,955
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that he's really pushing for a meeting relatively soon.

784
00:59:43,436 --> 00:59:50,162
[SPEAKER_04]: And as soon as we get that meeting up and running, I think it's going to be a very interesting meeting to see who shows up.

785
00:59:50,202 --> 00:59:54,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I think this isn't just a South Street issue.

786
00:59:54,627 --> 00:59:55,828
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the whole community's had it.

787
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:11,490
[SPEAKER_04]: people don't want to see those accidents because again I know that we said that when someone gets killed is when there's an uproar and then all of a sudden you see flashing lights and you see cones and paint.

788
01:00:15,219 --> 01:00:16,701
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want it to get to that level.

789
01:00:16,741 --> 01:00:21,868
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we can move that along, Mr. President, I appreciate it.

790
01:00:21,948 --> 01:00:33,182
[SPEAKER_09]: Your motion is basically to get an update from the administration and from the chief of police with regards to some of the traffic changes, some of the things that we can do locally.

791
01:00:33,222 --> 01:00:46,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, and I believe what was mentioned was the painting of the roadway to minimize to one lane, to look at the raised sidewalk, and the stop signs further up South Street, especially in Truro.

792
01:00:50,071 --> 01:00:53,914
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, in a minute, you can amend anything you want.

793
01:00:54,434 --> 01:00:55,655
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

794
01:01:00,083 --> 01:01:00,743
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Caraviello.

795
01:01:01,063 --> 01:01:01,744
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

796
01:01:01,764 --> 01:01:16,150
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if you attended the meeting Wednesday night at the Tufts with the Chief, and I was a little amazed that they gave us some stats of how many cars go down South Street, but if I heard him right, 85,000 cars.

797
01:01:19,648 --> 01:01:20,508
[SPEAKER_16]: a day going down that street.

798
01:01:21,108 --> 01:01:24,490
[SPEAKER_16]: And I was mortified that he had that number that he came up with.

799
01:01:25,010 --> 01:01:32,932
[SPEAKER_16]: When they had the traffic thing, they're monitoring the speed, he said the speed wasn't as big an issue as they thought.

800
01:01:33,332 --> 01:01:34,973
[SPEAKER_16]: He said as many cars come down.

801
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:40,264
[SPEAKER_16]: The average speed at, what did he say, it was like 28 miles an hour or something like that?

802
01:01:40,284 --> 01:01:40,985
[SPEAKER_16]: Something like that.

803
01:01:41,005 --> 01:01:44,428
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, he said the cars, it looked like they were going faster because there was so many.

804
01:01:44,748 --> 01:01:48,872
[SPEAKER_16]: But it wasn't the speed, it was 85,000 cars going down that road every day.

805
01:01:48,892 --> 01:01:53,416
[SPEAKER_16]: And it was just amazing how there hasn't been more accidents there.

806
01:01:53,696 --> 01:01:58,221
[SPEAKER_16]: But he's on board with us trying to get the state there as quick as we can.

807
01:01:59,101 --> 01:01:59,702
[SPEAKER_16]: to do something.

808
01:02:00,142 --> 01:02:06,047
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know he's at his wit's end on getting something done there too.

809
01:02:07,428 --> 01:02:10,911
[SPEAKER_16]: Even if it's just a stop sign up there.

810
01:02:10,931 --> 01:02:13,673
[SPEAKER_16]: So I know everyone is trying hard on this.

811
01:02:13,693 --> 01:02:14,894
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.

812
01:02:14,914 --> 01:02:18,477
[SPEAKER_01]: The trucking route through the neighborhood is also a giant issue.

813
01:02:18,497 --> 01:02:18,577
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

814
01:02:21,033 --> 01:02:25,195
[SPEAKER_16]: And you're right, because trucks aren't allowed on Mystic Valley Parkway.

815
01:02:26,216 --> 01:02:31,299
[SPEAKER_16]: And they always have the truck unit down there pulling them over when they go on there.

816
01:02:31,580 --> 01:02:33,301
[SPEAKER_16]: They're parked in the shell there.

817
01:02:34,001 --> 01:02:35,182
[SPEAKER_16]: And they pull the guys over.

818
01:02:35,582 --> 01:02:38,244
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's a contiguous road that goes away.

819
01:02:38,384 --> 01:02:42,287
[SPEAKER_16]: So I don't know if you can just allow trucks to get on that part, but not on the other.

820
01:02:42,887 --> 01:02:46,189
[SPEAKER_16]: So that'd be another question for the state to answer.

821
01:02:47,610 --> 01:02:48,731
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

822
01:02:49,031 --> 01:02:49,832
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Bears.

823
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:54,104
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for bringing this up.

824
01:02:54,204 --> 01:02:57,426
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we definitely need to look at the Toro and Walnut stop signs.

825
01:02:57,466 --> 01:03:00,888
[SPEAKER_12]: Residents of that neighborhood mentioned that to me a lot when I was down there in the fall.

826
01:03:01,729 --> 01:03:06,272
[SPEAKER_12]: The other thing, I think residents on Curtis Street, they're a two-way street.

827
01:03:06,312 --> 01:03:10,835
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the first street parallel to Winthrop coming down South Street towards the square.

828
01:03:11,175 --> 01:03:12,076
[SPEAKER_12]: That's currently two-way.

829
01:03:12,096 --> 01:03:13,637
[SPEAKER_12]: The residents would like that to be a one-way.

830
01:03:13,677 --> 01:03:15,738
[SPEAKER_12]: It's becoming a cut-through and it's also

831
01:03:17,533 --> 01:03:18,414
[SPEAKER_12]: to the residents' concerns.

832
01:03:18,434 --> 01:03:19,956
[SPEAKER_12]: They think it's endangering children on the street.

833
01:03:19,976 --> 01:03:20,817
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no sidewalks.

834
01:03:21,177 --> 01:03:23,580
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's something I'd like to add to the list.

835
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:26,723
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it'd be good to look at trucking somehow.

836
01:03:26,843 --> 01:03:30,007
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know what the answer is there, because they are banned on Mystic Valley Parkway.

837
01:03:30,067 --> 01:03:31,949
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't know that High Street is the option either.

838
01:03:32,469 --> 01:03:33,831
[SPEAKER_12]: But we should definitely look at it.

839
01:03:34,391 --> 01:03:35,252
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

840
01:03:38,035 --> 01:03:38,476
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

841
01:03:39,047 --> 01:03:40,209
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

842
01:03:40,249 --> 01:03:46,315
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to further amend the paper to request that we have random rush hour directed patrols by the traffic division.

843
01:03:47,036 --> 01:03:48,378
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that Chief Buckley has

844
01:03:49,765 --> 01:03:53,187
[SPEAKER_02]: been a vocal proponent for addressing concerns down in this area.

845
01:03:54,487 --> 01:04:09,795
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that this is something that his administration over at the police department will support to address some of the speeding vehicles, some of the, what do they call it, skipping or lane skipping across from South Street to Route 16.

846
01:04:10,755 --> 01:04:20,967
[SPEAKER_02]: and the like, some of the traffic control devices that are in place right now that aren't being enforced, I think with enforcement will certainly provide a benefit to the quality of life of the residents in the neighborhood.

847
01:04:22,008 --> 01:04:26,172
[SPEAKER_02]: I also would be remiss if I didn't point out that life on South Street will change.

848
01:04:27,217 --> 01:04:30,919
[SPEAKER_02]: very soon when the Eversource Pipeline project begins.

849
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:46,930
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm hoping, Mr. President, that we can coordinate our efforts so that when the construction of the Eversource Pipeline is complete, that our concerns are addressed with the intersection of South and Main as well, so that when the intersection or the roadway opens,

850
01:04:48,030 --> 01:04:53,773
[SPEAKER_02]: It opens up with a nice new road for the residents in the neighborhood and some nice new traffic control devices for the residents in the neighborhood as well.

851
01:04:54,373 --> 01:05:03,697
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that one of the things that we can use to leverage our ability to get these lights would be the fact that we do have a mitigation agreement in place for the Eversource Pipeline Project.

852
01:05:04,697 --> 01:05:11,921
[SPEAKER_02]: And we may be able to go back in and open that back up and talk about some other items that need to be addressed and put on the table as we move forward.

853
01:05:12,741 --> 01:05:13,561
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

854
01:05:14,122 --> 01:05:14,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks.

855
01:05:16,090 --> 01:05:17,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

856
01:05:17,872 --> 01:05:27,424
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it was several months back when we had 200 residents from that area, the South Street area, come up when the may was looking to change the direction of South Street.

857
01:05:28,625 --> 01:05:30,346
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is a two-part issue.

858
01:05:30,846 --> 01:05:35,229
[SPEAKER_05]: The corner of Main and South is state property, and we understand that.

859
01:05:35,829 --> 01:05:40,632
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've been going back and forth with the state regarding signalization and signage.

860
01:05:41,132 --> 01:05:49,697
[SPEAKER_05]: But what Mr. Lamb is talking about is South Street, which is under the purview of the city of Medford.

861
01:05:51,161 --> 01:06:06,190
[SPEAKER_05]: And that night, this council voted unanimously on several, like Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, several traffic calming initiatives, some being additional striping, some being signage, raised crosswalk.

862
01:06:06,470 --> 01:06:16,095
[SPEAKER_05]: There were a number of things that were offered that night with the chief, Chief Buckley, that was in the room, Mr. President, and heard the discussion, heard the residents, heard this council.

863
01:06:16,956 --> 01:06:20,378
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't say how disappointed I am, many months later,

864
01:06:21,528 --> 01:06:26,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that the state didn't act, but that the city has not acted, Mr. President.

865
01:06:28,653 --> 01:06:39,200
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's even more troubling when I drive around the city and see signs popping up everywhere, Mr. President, stop signs, pedestrian crossing signs, and that's great.

866
01:06:40,161 --> 01:06:50,748
[SPEAKER_05]: But this area we've been talking about for years, Mr. President, for years, and we still couldn't get a sign erected after having 200 people come up here discussing the issue.

867
01:06:51,559 --> 01:06:52,379
[SPEAKER_05]: What is it going to take?

868
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:55,821
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't understand what it takes to get something done.

869
01:06:58,063 --> 01:07:00,524
[SPEAKER_05]: And we received no correspondence back.

870
01:07:01,685 --> 01:07:03,506
[SPEAKER_05]: That's even more troubling, Mr. President.

871
01:07:04,506 --> 01:07:08,028
[SPEAKER_05]: We can put out resolution after resolution after resolution.

872
01:07:09,669 --> 01:07:14,172
[SPEAKER_05]: And if there's no follow through with this council, then what good is it?

873
01:07:16,048 --> 01:07:17,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Really, we're spinning our wheels.

874
01:07:18,529 --> 01:07:21,730
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to be in here a year from now talking about the same issue.

875
01:07:26,492 --> 01:07:37,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, someone needs to dig up that vote that the council took and resend it to the Chief of Police and the Traffic Commission immediately, asking why hasn't this been done?

876
01:07:38,637 --> 01:07:39,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Why hasn't it been done?

877
01:07:41,843 --> 01:07:47,669
[SPEAKER_05]: The traffic commission has met several times since the residents came down.

878
01:07:47,969 --> 01:07:48,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there an issue?

879
01:07:48,870 --> 01:07:50,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a problem that we should be concerned about?

880
01:07:51,112 --> 01:07:52,933
[SPEAKER_05]: If not, these signs should have gone up.

881
01:07:53,394 --> 01:07:55,856
[SPEAKER_05]: The weather has been permitting for the last couple of months.

882
01:07:57,958 --> 01:07:59,700
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no excuses, Mr. President.

883
01:08:00,741 --> 01:08:01,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Really, enough's enough.

884
01:08:03,025 --> 01:08:09,591
[SPEAKER_05]: And this, you know, as Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, I'm tired of talking about the same problems over and over and over again.

885
01:08:09,791 --> 01:08:10,932
[SPEAKER_05]: We're wasting our time.

886
01:08:11,532 --> 01:08:12,173
[SPEAKER_05]: We really are.

887
01:08:13,294 --> 01:08:18,839
[SPEAKER_05]: And regarding the trucking route, really, it's the traffic commission that can do something about the trucking route.

888
01:08:20,063 --> 01:08:26,566
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's an act of Congress to get it changed, just so you know, because you've got to go to the state and so forth.

889
01:08:26,866 --> 01:08:28,647
[SPEAKER_05]: And they did it on Harvard and Salt Method.

890
01:08:29,107 --> 01:08:29,867
[SPEAKER_05]: They changed that.

891
01:08:30,148 --> 01:08:31,368
[SPEAKER_05]: It's no longer a trucking route.

892
01:08:31,588 --> 01:08:38,411
[SPEAKER_05]: But that took, I think, about three and a half to four years of actively pursuing it and so forth and coming out with alternatives.

893
01:08:38,471 --> 01:08:40,372
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was a real act.

894
01:08:40,812 --> 01:08:44,414
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's really who would be responsible, the Traffic Commission.

895
01:08:44,887 --> 01:08:48,096
[SPEAKER_05]: and you can get put on their agenda and so forth and speak on it.

896
01:08:48,677 --> 01:08:51,966
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would just hate to see, Mr. President, when people come up here,

897
01:08:53,194 --> 01:08:54,996
[SPEAKER_05]: They expect to get results and answers.

898
01:08:56,197 --> 01:08:57,679
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why they come to the city council.

899
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:07,470
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we're just going to rubber stamp something and send it off to a department and no follow through to make sure things are actually getting done, then what good are we?

900
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:08,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

901
01:09:08,871 --> 01:09:10,033
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm part of it too.

902
01:09:10,073 --> 01:09:11,755
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not pointing the finger at anyone.

903
01:09:11,935 --> 01:09:14,558
[SPEAKER_05]: What good are we if we can't get these basic things done?

904
01:09:16,431 --> 01:09:17,892
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes no sense, Mr. President.

905
01:09:18,232 --> 01:09:20,133
[SPEAKER_05]: So that should be sent out immediately.

906
01:09:20,153 --> 01:09:27,177
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if it should come from you as the president of the council to reach out to the chief, or if the city clerk should send a correspondence first thing tomorrow.

907
01:09:27,477 --> 01:09:29,398
[SPEAKER_05]: But I want to know what happened to all those votes.

908
01:09:29,658 --> 01:09:32,820
[SPEAKER_05]: We spent three hours here, Mr. President, talking to residents.

909
01:09:33,060 --> 01:09:36,602
[SPEAKER_05]: We heard 100 people testify, and then nothing got done.

910
01:09:36,622 --> 01:09:39,264
[SPEAKER_05]: And we can't turn the finger at the state.

911
01:09:39,524 --> 01:09:40,584
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a city problem.

912
01:09:40,704 --> 01:09:41,665
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a city street.

913
01:09:42,345 --> 01:09:43,446
[SPEAKER_05]: It's our traffic commission.

914
01:09:45,237 --> 01:09:46,018
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

915
01:09:46,038 --> 01:09:46,959
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilmarks.

916
01:09:46,999 --> 01:09:51,624
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilmarks, I share your frustrations as well as the frustrations of everyone here.

917
01:09:52,705 --> 01:09:58,791
[SPEAKER_09]: What I'll do is I will actually, the city clerk and I will talk to see

918
01:09:59,968 --> 01:10:05,370
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, when the resolution went out, making sure it went out and actually see if anything came back.

919
01:10:05,550 --> 01:10:23,016
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds like maybe nothing came back, but I will personally follow up with the chief to make sure we have something in writing, you know, basically responding to the votes that were taken that night, because there were quite a few votes and there were quite a few recommendations that this council made that can be done at the local level.

920
01:10:23,476 --> 01:10:27,638
[SPEAKER_09]: So I will, I'll make sure that that gets resolved.

921
01:10:27,838 --> 01:10:28,178
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

922
01:10:29,918 --> 01:10:30,438
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

923
01:10:30,898 --> 01:10:36,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, a motion to authorize the clerk to write the letter to the chief of police making inquiry.

924
01:10:37,361 --> 01:10:53,447
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to draft a letter and to send that letter to the chief of police to get a response from our previous resolutions that were offered

925
01:10:53,786 --> 01:10:56,047
[SPEAKER_09]: with regard to South Street traffic.

926
01:10:56,607 --> 01:10:57,688
[SPEAKER_09]: Seconded by Councilor Bears.

927
01:10:57,728 --> 01:10:58,448
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

928
01:10:58,968 --> 01:11:00,389
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

929
01:11:00,409 --> 01:11:01,309
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion passes.

930
01:11:01,929 --> 01:11:04,030
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Bears, did you have additional comments?

931
01:11:06,331 --> 01:11:07,191
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, thank you, Mr. President.

932
01:11:07,251 --> 01:11:09,632
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wonder if it's worth putting a time limit.

933
01:11:10,132 --> 01:11:15,674
[SPEAKER_12]: I know we just voted on it, but some sort of time frame that we'd like a response by X sooner rather than later.

934
01:11:15,754 --> 01:11:20,136
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't want to define the time limit, but I think follow through requires a deadline.

935
01:11:20,156 --> 01:11:22,277
[SPEAKER_12]: We should set the deadline and expect them to follow through.

936
01:11:22,437 --> 01:11:24,058
[SPEAKER_09]: The chief does have 10 days to respond.

937
01:11:24,098 --> 01:11:24,338
[SPEAKER_12]: 10 days.

938
01:11:24,378 --> 01:11:24,638
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

939
01:11:24,778 --> 01:11:25,119
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

940
01:11:25,539 --> 01:11:25,839
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

941
01:11:27,020 --> 01:11:29,762
[SPEAKER_09]: If we could please have your name and address for the record.

942
01:11:31,102 --> 01:11:35,325
[SPEAKER_14]: Andrew Castagnetti, uh, Cushman street, East Method, Massachusetts.

943
01:11:36,086 --> 01:11:45,471
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, definitely I'm in agreement that South and main street is most dangerous intersection probably in all the city.

944
01:11:45,952 --> 01:11:51,035
[SPEAKER_14]: And as Councilor mocks has had said at the last meeting that, uh,

945
01:11:51,816 --> 01:12:11,323
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not the only intersection that we should be looking into to make it safer, such as Mystic Ave and Hancock Street near Atlas Liquors, Park Street and Riverside Avenue with that high fence that's hard to see coming onto Riverside from Park.

946
01:12:12,342 --> 01:12:22,030
[SPEAKER_14]: in other locations, I'm sure, but this south of Maine has been a major problem since before I got my license, 50 years ago even.

947
01:12:24,192 --> 01:12:30,237
[SPEAKER_14]: And it seems that it's getting worse with more congestion and cars trying to get into Boston.

948
01:12:35,242 --> 01:12:38,785
[SPEAKER_14]: I would think, at the risk of repeating myself from last meeting,

949
01:12:40,298 --> 01:12:50,065
[SPEAKER_14]: Why can't we, as they say, the low-hanging fruit, erect two signs at the end of South Street before the end of Main Street, which becomes our city street?

950
01:12:53,307 --> 01:12:55,328
[SPEAKER_14]: That you take a right turn only.

951
01:12:56,990 --> 01:13:04,755
[SPEAKER_14]: I understand it would be a change, but it would eliminate people going across, which is already illegal, towards 93, but they do it regardless.

952
01:13:05,529 --> 01:13:11,693
[SPEAKER_14]: and they want to enter the center of Main Street, they want to take a left underneath Route 16, going to Medford Square.

953
01:13:11,873 --> 01:13:15,295
[SPEAKER_14]: That's where a lot of the accidents happen.

954
01:13:15,695 --> 01:13:19,518
[SPEAKER_14]: So if it was right turn only, I understand it's a change.

955
01:13:20,218 --> 01:13:24,781
[SPEAKER_14]: However, why not just try it on a three-month trial basis?

956
01:13:26,485 --> 01:13:39,636
[SPEAKER_14]: and just see what happens, because some action would be better than zero action, instead of talking about a pie dream, about $5 million light travel signal systems from here to Malden Square.

957
01:13:39,857 --> 01:13:42,759
[SPEAKER_14]: That sounds absurd to me.

958
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:50,586
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just, it's sad, because there's a lot of injuries, and there's been deaths there.

959
01:13:53,376 --> 01:13:58,399
[SPEAKER_14]: I just hope that they could try a simple solution, a right to an only.

960
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:00,521
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for listening.

961
01:14:00,761 --> 01:14:01,441
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

962
01:14:06,344 --> 01:14:18,112
[SPEAKER_09]: While we're under suspension, offered by Councilor Marks, 20-031, be it resolved that a moment of silence be held for long-time Medford firefighter, Robert Minichiello, on his recent passing.

963
01:14:18,132 --> 01:14:22,795
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

964
01:14:23,657 --> 01:14:24,179
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Marks.

965
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:25,502
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you Mr. President.

966
01:14:26,004 --> 01:14:29,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Bob was a tremendous firefighter.

967
01:14:29,665 --> 01:14:39,888
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just getting on the council when he was actually retiring, but he served with distinction this community and its residents for over 29 years, Mr. President.

968
01:14:40,288 --> 01:14:42,709
[SPEAKER_05]: He served in engine two and engine six.

969
01:14:43,369 --> 01:14:48,911
[SPEAKER_05]: And from what I hear from some of the firefighters that served with him, he was always there for an encouraging word.

970
01:14:49,791 --> 01:14:58,214
[SPEAKER_05]: He was like the gatekeeper of every engine he was part of and was really the glue that held it together.

971
01:14:59,014 --> 01:15:01,197
[SPEAKER_05]: And he will be sorely missed, Mr. President.

972
01:15:01,878 --> 01:15:02,839
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

973
01:15:05,783 --> 01:15:08,647
[SPEAKER_09]: At this time, I'd ask everyone to please rise for a brief moment of silence.

974
01:15:28,677 --> 01:15:33,178
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Knight to revert back to the regular order of business.

975
01:15:33,298 --> 01:15:33,979
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

976
01:15:34,279 --> 01:15:34,999
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

977
01:15:35,019 --> 01:15:35,939
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion passes.

978
01:15:55,645 --> 01:15:55,905
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

979
01:15:57,175 --> 01:16:16,031
[SPEAKER_16]: 2-0-0-2-3 offered by President Falco, be it resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate Kevin Wright from the Boy Scouts Troop 416 on earning the rank of Eagle Scout, be it further resolved that Kevin Wright be invited to a future meeting to be recognized by the Medford City Council.

980
01:16:18,092 --> 01:16:18,673
[SPEAKER_16]: President Falco.

981
01:16:39,216 --> 01:16:39,696
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

982
01:16:39,976 --> 01:16:40,717
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I do.

983
01:16:40,817 --> 01:16:42,158
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

984
01:16:42,818 --> 01:16:48,382
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to congratulate Kevin Wright on earning his Eagle Scout.

985
01:16:48,842 --> 01:16:49,382
[SPEAKER_09]: As we all know,

986
01:16:51,117 --> 01:16:55,380
[SPEAKER_09]: Earning the rank of Eagle is not easy.

987
01:16:55,680 --> 01:16:57,902
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's hard and takes a lot of commitment and dedication.

988
01:16:58,842 --> 01:17:00,283
[SPEAKER_09]: I've known Kevin for a long time.

989
01:17:00,303 --> 01:17:04,046
[SPEAKER_09]: He goes to Bedford Public Schools.

990
01:17:04,166 --> 01:17:05,787
[SPEAKER_09]: He's dedicated to our community.

991
01:17:06,347 --> 01:17:11,491
[SPEAKER_09]: His Eagle Scout project was to build a park bench.

992
01:17:11,831 --> 01:17:14,993
[SPEAKER_09]: He built a park bench and a lending library for the senior center.

993
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:18,081
[SPEAKER_09]: And so he worked hard on that.

994
01:17:18,721 --> 01:17:23,042
[SPEAKER_09]: And he's been volunteering for many years throughout the community along with his parents.

995
01:17:23,682 --> 01:17:31,904
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'd like to invite him to a future council meeting to be recognized by the Medford City Council and congratulate him on earning the rank of Eagle.

996
01:17:32,884 --> 01:17:33,224
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

997
01:17:36,325 --> 01:17:37,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

998
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:40,629
[SPEAKER_04]: I thank Councilor Falcon for bringing this forward.

999
01:17:40,649 --> 01:17:51,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Kevin's a wonderful young man, great family, and anything Kevin puts his mind to, he accomplishes, which is an amazing feat.

1000
01:17:52,282 --> 01:17:54,144
[SPEAKER_04]: If you know Kevin, Kevin's a

1001
01:17:55,705 --> 01:17:59,046
[SPEAKER_04]: big kid and loves giving back to the community.

1002
01:17:59,106 --> 01:18:08,928
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know just recently he just started coaching Little League and he takes that same type of passion to like what's what he does with the Eagles with the scouts.

1003
01:18:08,968 --> 01:18:16,349
[SPEAKER_04]: So I I second Council Falco's resolve and congratulate Kevin on a well-earned Eagle Scout.

1004
01:18:16,769 --> 01:18:17,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1005
01:18:33,153 --> 01:18:37,256
[SPEAKER_12]: 7.

1006
01:18:36,095 --> 01:18:37,256
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1007
01:18:37,376 --> 01:18:40,378
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to thank President Falco for bringing this forward.

1008
01:18:41,138 --> 01:18:49,264
[SPEAKER_12]: I was never a scout myself, but I was on the service projects of many of my friends who were, and becoming an Eagle Scout is certainly no easy task.

1009
01:18:49,324 --> 01:18:51,145
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think it's something to be congratulated.

1010
01:18:57,823 --> 01:19:00,924
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion of President Falco, seconded by Councilor Knight, all in favor?

1011
01:19:01,105 --> 01:19:01,385
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

1012
01:19:01,725 --> 01:19:02,645
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion passes.

1013
01:19:02,665 --> 01:19:24,675
[SPEAKER_16]: 2-0-0-2-4 offered by President Falco, whereas the City of Medford is only five miles north of Austin and is a very desirable place to live in, and whereas housing prices have been rapidly increasing throughout the City of Medford, therefore be it resolved that the City of Medford, excuse me, that the Medford City Council develop

1014
01:19:25,102 --> 01:19:27,844
[SPEAKER_16]: and establish an affordable housing trust.

1015
01:19:29,946 --> 01:19:30,987
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

1016
01:19:36,172 --> 01:19:36,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1017
01:19:38,013 --> 01:19:38,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1018
01:19:44,218 --> 01:19:45,119
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be here all night now.

1019
01:19:45,139 --> 01:19:45,680
[SPEAKER_04]: This is great.

1020
01:19:45,700 --> 01:19:45,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job.

1021
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:48,122
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

1022
01:19:48,702 --> 01:19:50,344
[SPEAKER_09]: As we all know, you know,

1023
01:19:51,527 --> 01:19:56,590
[SPEAKER_09]: Our fine city has become a very popular place to rent, buy a home, or raise a family.

1024
01:19:56,630 --> 01:20:06,596
[SPEAKER_09]: Being only five miles north of Boston, Medford is a very desirable location with great schools, direct access to Boston, and access to a lot of green space.

1025
01:20:07,216 --> 01:20:10,598
[SPEAKER_09]: We also know that to buy a home in our community, it takes a lot of money.

1026
01:20:12,039 --> 01:20:14,220
[SPEAKER_09]: Homes that once sold for $300,000, $400,000, $500,000 are now selling for $600,000, $700,000, $800,000, if not higher.

1027
01:20:18,609 --> 01:20:24,714
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know as I walk and see people throughout the community, this always comes up as an issue.

1028
01:20:24,974 --> 01:20:33,420
[SPEAKER_09]: And a lot of people ask, well, where will the kids that are growing up today in our city, will they be able to afford to buy a home here in our city, a city that we all love?

1029
01:20:34,561 --> 01:20:38,104
[SPEAKER_09]: And that really becomes a really tough question to answer.

1030
01:20:38,945 --> 01:20:47,871
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you go online, you'll see many articles regarding the housing crisis, not only in Boston, but also in the greater Boston area, but here in Medford.

1031
01:20:48,531 --> 01:20:51,853
[SPEAKER_09]: Tonight, I ask my colleagues to support this resolution that I offer tonight.

1032
01:20:52,293 --> 01:20:56,776
[SPEAKER_09]: I firmly believe that it's time that we establish an affordable housing trust.

1033
01:20:57,436 --> 01:21:07,943
[SPEAKER_09]: Although the concept is not new, there are many communities throughout the Commonwealth that have shown increased interest in forming their own municipal housing trust funds.

1034
01:21:09,262 --> 01:21:17,690
[SPEAKER_09]: In 2005, the state legislature passed the Municipal Affordable Housing Trust Fund law to simplify the process of establishing local housing trust funds.

1035
01:21:18,391 --> 01:21:31,203
[SPEAKER_09]: Since the law passed, 98 communities in Massachusetts have established Municipal Affordable Housing Trusts, raising the overall total number of communities with housing trust to approximately 109.

1036
01:21:33,162 --> 01:22:02,689
[SPEAKER_09]: Examples of what a local affordable housing trust can do include provide financial support for the construction of affordable homes by private developers, both for-profit and not-for-profit, rehabilitate existing homes to convert to affordable housing, increase affordability in new housing development projects, develop service municipal land or buildings, preserve properties faced with expiring affordability restrictions,

1037
01:22:03,139 --> 01:22:06,843
[SPEAKER_09]: and support rent assistance for low and moderate income households.

1038
01:22:08,565 --> 01:22:12,169
[SPEAKER_09]: What funds can local housing trusts use?

1039
01:22:12,189 --> 01:22:14,251
[SPEAKER_09]: The sources of funding can vary.

1040
01:22:14,692 --> 01:22:17,795
[SPEAKER_09]: You can use community preservation CPA funds.

1041
01:22:18,335 --> 01:22:22,480
[SPEAKER_09]: They can use inclusionary zoning payments, negotiating development fees.

1042
01:22:23,372 --> 01:22:36,763
[SPEAKER_09]: developer fees, the municipality's general fund, tax titles and sales, payments from special bylaws and ordinances, cell tower lease payments, private donations, that's to name a few.

1043
01:22:38,504 --> 01:22:44,429
[SPEAKER_09]: But it seems like in most communities, CPA funds are definitely, you know, what's used I think most of the time.

1044
01:22:45,090 --> 01:22:50,634
[SPEAKER_09]: So in your package tonight, I included a boil plate template of some draft language

1045
01:22:51,147 --> 01:22:54,893
[SPEAKER_09]: that we could use to establish a Municipal Affordable Housing Trust Ordinance.

1046
01:22:55,353 --> 01:22:56,916
[SPEAKER_09]: Now this is an extant stone.

1047
01:22:57,433 --> 01:23:08,376
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, what I'd like to see is us as a committee meet to actually work through this ordinance and actually develop something that's gonna benefit our community.

1048
01:23:09,196 --> 01:23:13,737
[SPEAKER_09]: There are many resources that we can use to do this.

1049
01:23:13,977 --> 01:23:19,438
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is just a boilerplate template of what we need to do and what one would look like.

1050
01:23:19,978 --> 01:23:25,280
[SPEAKER_09]: So at this point, I would ask my council colleagues to support this resolution.

1051
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:26,520
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would ask that we move this

1052
01:23:28,140 --> 01:23:54,457
[SPEAKER_09]: to the committee the whole and the reason why I don't want it to go to ordinance committee or I wish for it to go to committee the whole as I think this is a great learning opportunity for all of us over the next you know I think during this term there's going to be a lot of issues that come before us with regard to zoning with regard to housing and I think it's important that we all work on this together because I think this is going to benefit our community we should all have a say in this so at this point I would ask

1053
01:23:54,957 --> 01:24:01,444
[SPEAKER_09]: my council colleagues to support this, and if you could move this to Committee of the Whole for further review and debate.

1054
01:24:02,305 --> 01:24:02,605
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1055
01:24:02,945 --> 01:24:03,606
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1056
01:24:08,123 --> 01:24:09,084
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1057
01:24:09,264 --> 01:24:13,346
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to say I thought it was fantastic that it was on the agenda.

1058
01:24:13,886 --> 01:24:26,654
[SPEAKER_12]: This is something that I've talked to a lot of people about, that I campaigned for this office on, that Councilor Morell and I have written up some language as well, so we'd love to share it with the whole group and see where we can get to the best place.

1059
01:24:28,435 --> 01:24:30,776
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think another opportunity is Airbnb funding as well.

1060
01:24:30,856 --> 01:24:33,037
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, this short-term rental money could go to this.

1061
01:24:33,137 --> 01:24:41,221
[SPEAKER_12]: And I've spoken to people on the CPC, Community Preservation Committee, who think this is a great opportunity for them to use the affordable housing funds from the CPA.

1062
01:24:42,561 --> 01:24:53,106
[SPEAKER_12]: I was just at the Statehouse today testifying in favor of a bill that would give us the right to consider a transfer fee, which is another way that we could fund this if we want to really ramp this up, which I think

1063
01:24:55,038 --> 01:24:56,999
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, we would be the 110th community, right?

1064
01:24:57,079 --> 01:25:00,801
[SPEAKER_12]: There are a lot of communities that have had years and decades to put money into these funds.

1065
01:25:00,881 --> 01:25:03,542
[SPEAKER_12]: We are not there, but we need to be there quickly.

1066
01:25:03,642 --> 01:25:15,608
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think we need to really consider linkage and if this transfer fee goes through or even if it doesn't, maybe considering a home rule to make sure that we can fund this and really make sure that we build affordable units.

1067
01:25:15,628 --> 01:25:16,088
[SPEAKER_12]: You said, you know,

1068
01:25:16,708 --> 01:25:18,089
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not sure if kids can live here.

1069
01:25:18,109 --> 01:25:19,850
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm the kid who can't live here.

1070
01:25:19,910 --> 01:25:20,090
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

1071
01:25:20,190 --> 01:25:20,931
[SPEAKER_12]: I live with my parents.

1072
01:25:20,971 --> 01:25:25,814
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm 26 and I do that because I love this city and I want to represent the city and I'm honored to.

1073
01:25:26,815 --> 01:25:28,255
[SPEAKER_12]: But I'd love to live in an apartment.

1074
01:25:28,295 --> 01:25:29,556
[SPEAKER_12]: You know I'd love to do that.

1075
01:25:29,636 --> 01:25:31,858
[SPEAKER_12]: But in Medford that's not an option for me right now.

1076
01:25:31,978 --> 01:25:32,098
[SPEAKER_12]: So.

1077
01:25:32,613 --> 01:25:35,235
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, it's not, to me, a hard question to answer.

1078
01:25:35,836 --> 01:25:36,377
[SPEAKER_12]: We need this.

1079
01:25:36,437 --> 01:25:37,377
[SPEAKER_12]: We need it immediately.

1080
01:25:38,238 --> 01:25:42,843
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think also looking, you know, big developers are coming in, that we have very valuable land.

1081
01:25:43,823 --> 01:25:47,787
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we should look at linkage fees and stuff like that to fund something like this as well.

1082
01:25:47,807 --> 01:25:50,169
[SPEAKER_12]: So I really, really, really want to have this conversation.

1083
01:25:50,209 --> 01:25:51,250
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm really glad that it's starting.

1084
01:25:52,071 --> 01:25:52,812
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilman Vance.

1085
01:25:54,655 --> 01:25:55,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Knight.

1086
01:25:55,515 --> 01:26:01,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, thank you very much, and I thank Councilor Falco for bringing this resolution forward, or this draft ordinance forward.

1087
01:26:01,838 --> 01:26:12,522
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that did stand out in his speech was using inclusionary zoning payments to fund an affordable housing trust, and this is something I cannot support.

1088
01:26:13,723 --> 01:26:17,664
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that it's just a basic launch pad right now for the start of a discussion.

1089
01:26:18,285 --> 01:26:24,167
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I don't feel as though allowing developers to buy their way out of the inclusionary zoning ordinance that we have in place is the answer.

1090
01:26:25,039 --> 01:26:32,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Ultimately, the way that this would work, Mr. President, if we're allowing inclusionary zoning payments to fund our affordable housing trust fund would be that instead of developing

1091
01:26:33,245 --> 01:26:40,709
[SPEAKER_02]: the affordable housing on site, they would be making a payment to the affordable housing trust and not creating affordable housing on site.

1092
01:26:41,450 --> 01:26:47,393
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that all that does is promote gentrification in these type of developments and I think it really takes the developers off the hook.

1093
01:26:48,014 --> 01:26:53,817
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're really serious about creating affordable housing in the community, we can't let the developers buy their way out of it.

1094
01:26:55,218 --> 01:26:58,501
[SPEAKER_02]: I thank Councilor Falco for bringing it up, but that's something that I'm very passionate about.

1095
01:26:58,541 --> 01:27:10,111
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't feel as though we should allow these developers the opportunity to just pay their way out of their obligation to help us meet our obligations for affordable housing in this community so that the people that made this community a great community can continue to live here.

1096
01:27:16,752 --> 01:27:17,252
[SPEAKER_16]: President Falco.

1097
01:27:17,532 --> 01:27:20,833
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello, and thank you, Councilor Knight.

1098
01:27:20,853 --> 01:27:22,493
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are just options.

1099
01:27:22,553 --> 01:27:24,874
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not recommending that we do that.

1100
01:27:24,914 --> 01:27:26,294
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I said, this is a boil plate.

1101
01:27:26,754 --> 01:27:29,375
[SPEAKER_09]: It's something to look at to get the conversation started.

1102
01:27:30,135 --> 01:27:37,596
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why it would go to committee of the whole to actually go through those list of options of what's available to us, not holding us to anything here.

1103
01:27:37,976 --> 01:27:39,197
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing's etched in stone here.

1104
01:27:39,577 --> 01:27:42,037
[SPEAKER_09]: This is just some of what other communities have used.

1105
01:27:42,097 --> 01:27:45,998
[SPEAKER_09]: I just literally went through a list of things that I saw in the research that I did.

1106
01:27:46,838 --> 01:27:49,299
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm not saying we have to do this.

1107
01:27:49,779 --> 01:27:57,822
[SPEAKER_09]: I completely understand your concern and it's valid, but I was just laying it out there as options of what other communities have done.

1108
01:27:58,782 --> 01:28:01,903
[SPEAKER_09]: But by no means am I saying that anything is final here.

1109
01:28:01,963 --> 01:28:06,065
[SPEAKER_09]: This is boilerplate, sample language, sample ideas, that's all it is.

1110
01:28:06,825 --> 01:28:17,509
[SPEAKER_09]: My goal tonight is basically just to get everyone on board of You know moving this to committee the whole so we can talk about it and work through and build an ordinance of our own That's basically the goal for tonight.

1111
01:28:17,829 --> 01:28:26,532
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no specifics as to what I want to do here with regard to You know how we would spend the funds or obtain the funds or anything like that So, thank you.

1112
01:28:26,652 --> 01:28:29,093
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President Councilor Morell

1113
01:28:29,993 --> 01:28:32,614
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you, Councilor Falco, for introducing this.

1114
01:28:32,834 --> 01:28:35,735
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm really excited to see this come up so early in session.

1115
01:28:36,395 --> 01:28:40,596
[SPEAKER_15]: As Councilor Bears mentioned, it's something that we were really kind of working on behind the scenes.

1116
01:28:40,636 --> 01:28:41,736
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm excited to see it come up.

1117
01:28:42,756 --> 01:28:48,938
[SPEAKER_15]: Something worth noting is that beyond kind of the power of the purse that something has like this, which I'm really excited about, is

1118
01:28:50,212 --> 01:29:04,196
[SPEAKER_15]: The trustees can really play a role in policy, be advocates for policy, and a lot of times when you build this board in the right way, you have people that are experts in these areas of affordable housing, of development, and you get a diversity of ideas and people that can really help.

1119
01:29:04,900 --> 01:29:20,723
[SPEAKER_15]: Steward the city along as we make these decisions and I know we've got some great housing advocacy advocacy groups that already exist in the city And I think this would be something really powerful to kind of to codify some of the work that's already being done So I look forward to this coming to fruition.

1120
01:29:20,903 --> 01:29:32,645
[SPEAKER_16]: So, thank you Thank you for the discussion One second

1121
01:29:35,015 --> 01:29:35,436
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you hear me?

1122
01:29:35,596 --> 01:29:36,117
[SPEAKER_13]: I can hear you now.

1123
01:29:36,137 --> 01:29:36,557
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, great.

1124
01:29:37,679 --> 01:29:52,478
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'd like the City Council, while this issue is being discussed, to also consider regulating the amount and the cost of affordable housing, not just adding a trust that would supplement

1125
01:29:53,174 --> 01:30:05,000
[SPEAKER_13]: for people who, like most of us, can't afford the rates that are currently available for market rates in Medford.

1126
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:08,221
[SPEAKER_13]: I wanted to just give a quick example.

1127
01:30:08,321 --> 01:30:20,867
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you look at someone, a couple earning $4,000 on a fixed income, anyone on fixed income actually, a couple earning $4,000 in Social Security, which is quite a bit,

1128
01:30:21,614 --> 01:30:33,566
[SPEAKER_13]: for social security, even if they could get, if they were eligible for public housing, they would be getting a 30% rate, which means that they would be paying $1,333 a month for housing.

1129
01:30:39,453 --> 01:30:55,242
[SPEAKER_13]: And that would leave them with $2,667 a month for everything else, including medical expenses and food, which I think in this area is not, it's, I mean, it's basically living below the poverty level.

1130
01:30:55,682 --> 01:31:08,069
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's, I believe that the current guideline for affordable housing, to be eligible for affordable housing, a couple has to earn less than

1131
01:31:08,740 --> 01:31:21,463
[SPEAKER_13]: $2,250.

1132
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:21,463
[SPEAKER_13]: So, um, it basically excludes everybody in the middle range who, um, can't afford rent market rates.

1133
01:31:22,143 --> 01:31:37,507
[SPEAKER_13]: So I would suggest that we look at ways of, um, regulating the percentage of affordable housing and also raising the, um,

1134
01:31:38,603 --> 01:31:47,008
[SPEAKER_13]: the threshold so that, because there's plenty of housing in Medford, it's just not affordable.

1135
01:31:47,048 --> 01:31:50,050
[SPEAKER_13]: There's lots of development across the street from me.

1136
01:31:50,370 --> 01:32:03,118
[SPEAKER_13]: It was gentrified, that building was a one-story building that had people who were obviously paying relatively low rent.

1137
01:32:04,217 --> 01:32:09,521
[SPEAKER_13]: They were kicked out, the building was, they added a story, another story to the building.

1138
01:32:09,921 --> 01:32:14,785
[SPEAKER_13]: That building's been in construction for, in renovation for over a year.

1139
01:32:15,846 --> 01:32:19,468
[SPEAKER_13]: And I bet the rents there are gonna be astronomical.

1140
01:32:19,548 --> 01:32:23,291
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm just saying there's plenty of housing if we can tap into it.

1141
01:32:24,112 --> 01:32:30,456
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that even within the ability of,

1142
01:32:32,733 --> 01:32:38,159
[SPEAKER_13]: to construct the developers and the owners to make a profit.

1143
01:32:38,199 --> 01:32:46,908
[SPEAKER_13]: There's still lots of leeway there to raise the, I think for anyone earning under 4,000, they should actually be paying 20% of their income as,

1144
01:32:54,828 --> 01:33:02,872
[SPEAKER_13]: for housing, not 30%, because 30% leaves you with not enough to live on, and that's just a fact of life.

1145
01:33:03,132 --> 01:33:03,473
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1146
01:33:03,813 --> 01:33:04,153
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1147
01:33:06,194 --> 01:33:06,754
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Bez.

1148
01:33:07,475 --> 01:33:09,716
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to thank you for speaking.

1149
01:33:09,736 --> 01:33:16,860
[SPEAKER_12]: I do think we need to have this conversation because there are people in our community who are paying over 50% of their income for their housing, and it's a growing number.

1150
01:33:18,791 --> 01:33:46,100
[SPEAKER_12]: I think, and I just, again, I was at the State House talking about some state-level solutions to this housing problem, but we need to have a serious conversation, whether it's through the zoning review, or whether it's a separate conversation about what affordable means to Medford, and setting our affordable guidelines based on that, because I completely agree, what's there now isn't working, what is in existence in the affordable realm doesn't really apply to middle-income people, and again,

1151
01:33:46,986 --> 01:33:51,688
[SPEAKER_12]: We're talking about our home valuations in some cases quadrupling in the last 20 years.

1152
01:33:51,928 --> 01:33:55,689
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, we need to really think about what we're doing.

1153
01:33:56,089 --> 01:33:59,991
[SPEAKER_12]: And quite frankly, we need to try to adjust the market rate.

1154
01:34:00,091 --> 01:34:02,111
[SPEAKER_12]: That needs to be an intent of this body.

1155
01:34:02,191 --> 01:34:03,492
[SPEAKER_12]: We can do that.

1156
01:34:03,832 --> 01:34:07,813
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what happens if you build 100 affordable units, it changes the market rate in your city, right?

1157
01:34:07,913 --> 01:34:14,335
[SPEAKER_12]: So we need to have that as an intent, really think it through, because market rate housing isn't working for people.

1158
01:34:17,198 --> 01:34:26,081
[SPEAKER_12]: In my opinion, and I think the opinion of many people, let's build more market rate housing is just kind of a giveaway to big developers to want to build luxury condos.

1159
01:34:26,121 --> 01:34:28,261
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't think people in Medford really want that.

1160
01:34:28,341 --> 01:34:33,923
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think we need to have a broader conversation about what affordability means for us, who we want to live in Medford.

1161
01:34:35,084 --> 01:34:43,166
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think we can do it now, but I think it's something that we need to consider as we're considering the entire zoning review and what we're doing with development going forward.

1162
01:34:43,186 --> 01:34:44,547
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you for bringing that up.

1163
01:34:45,547 --> 01:34:45,867
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1164
01:34:47,361 --> 01:34:51,926

[SPEAKER_09]: The records of the meeting of January 7th were passed to Councilor Knight.

1171
01:35:31,844 --> 01:35:33,385
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight, how did you find the records?

1172
01:35:33,665 --> 01:35:39,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, I'm going to say that these were the most accurate meeting minutes that I've seen all year.
