01:07:17,801 --> 01:07:19,182
[SPEAKER_11]: On January 13th,

112
01:07:20,998 --> 01:07:21,639
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that the right date?

113
01:07:21,699 --> 01:07:23,401
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, I just scrolled out of the way.

114
01:07:23,442 --> 01:07:36,460
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, on January 13, the Rules, Policy and Equity Subcommittee met to begin drafting a list of our reports that reports slash presentations that would be become part of our rules.

115
01:07:37,787 --> 01:07:55,491
[SPEAKER_11]: for an annual list that would be provided that would give the superintendent and her staff the ability to plan ahead more easily and to make it obvious to the public and to new school committee members and existing ones when we actually do things.

116
01:07:56,551 --> 01:08:01,632
[SPEAKER_11]: As a new member, when do we get the report on MCAS?

117
01:08:02,288 --> 01:08:07,289
[SPEAKER_11]: For instance, there's just sort of an endless number of reports and presentations that we get each year.

118
01:08:08,049 --> 01:08:09,730
[SPEAKER_11]: And so we worked on that list.

119
01:08:09,790 --> 01:08:16,051
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we made an incredible good first draft at our next meeting, which I don't have the date in front of me.

120
01:08:16,471 --> 01:08:25,553
[SPEAKER_11]: At our next meeting, we will finalize the, well, assuming that the subcommittee approves it, we will finalize the list and send it up to the full committee for approval.

121
01:08:26,013 --> 01:08:28,534
[SPEAKER_11]: But at this time, we just have minutes from that meeting to approve.

122
01:08:28,834 --> 01:08:29,674
[SPEAKER_11]: So if there's a motion.

01:08:55,527 --> 01:08:59,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Number two, we have special education behavioral health subcommittee meeting, January 21st, 2021.

143
01:09:01,405 --> 01:09:03,827
[SPEAKER_06]: Member McLaughlin, chair, approval of minutes.

144
01:09:04,748 --> 01:09:05,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, thank you.

145
01:09:06,649 --> 01:09:10,893
[SPEAKER_07]: We met on January 21st for behavioral health.

146
01:09:10,933 --> 01:09:16,318
[SPEAKER_07]: We talked with Stacey Shulman, director of school counseling and behavioral health.

147
01:09:16,418 --> 01:09:28,828
[SPEAKER_07]: Our goal for this year is to address trauma-informed schools and stress and to make recommendations, policy recommendations to the school committee in a presentation in April or May of this year.

148
01:09:31,732 --> 01:09:56,812
[SPEAKER_07]: Stacey Shulman talked about the NAN project, which is a partnership through Elliott Health and Human Services created as a way to talk about mental health and behavioral health and their sort of mentor partnerships for students who have been through some mental health challenges and come out the other side to support students who are currently going through mental health challenges.

149
01:09:57,032 --> 01:09:59,695
[SPEAKER_07]: And there was also talk of a homework survey

150
01:10:00,335 --> 01:10:02,757
[SPEAKER_07]: that Stacey Shulman did a presentation on.

151
01:10:03,878 --> 01:10:15,009
[SPEAKER_07]: There were 781 student respondents to the survey around how many, whether there's a hypothesis that students were feeling that they were having a lot of homework.

152
01:10:16,470 --> 01:10:27,997
[SPEAKER_07]: but that perhaps it's actually a carryover of asynchronous work and so the survey was created to sort of look at that hypothesis and what it did discover was that there was a divide between students and faculty.

153
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:35,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Students did feel as though they were having more homework and teachers were feeling as though it was the same or

154
01:10:37,005 --> 01:10:38,986
[SPEAKER_07]: as in prior pre-pandemic.

155
01:10:39,026 --> 01:10:45,668
[SPEAKER_07]: So there was some question around clarity for students around what is asynchronous work and what is actually classified as homework.

156
01:10:46,768 --> 01:10:50,049
[SPEAKER_07]: So that discussion will be continued in our next meeting on February 11th.

157
01:10:51,110 --> 01:11:06,155
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the latter half of our meeting was on special education and our question of our policy, our question of practice is how can we facilitate meaningful inclusion, inclusionary friendships for students within school and community?

158
01:11:07,242 --> 01:11:14,447
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've been talking about best buddies programs, sibling support groups and participating in community activities like Metro Recreation.

159
01:11:14,967 --> 01:11:21,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Metro Recreation was on the call as well as many other parents and individuals and teachers.

160
01:11:22,131 --> 01:11:28,155
[SPEAKER_07]: And we talked about inclusive recreation activities and how we can support them, building a volunteer list.

161
01:11:28,175 --> 01:11:35,300
[SPEAKER_07]: So Metro Recreation is looking for volunteers to support students with disabilities and form friendships and

162
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:42,302
[SPEAKER_07]: support the Recreation Center for Inclusive Recreation, and we're building an Excel spreadsheet around that.

163
01:11:42,342 --> 01:11:54,607
[SPEAKER_07]: If people are interested in supporting that, they can email me at melaniemclaughlin at medford.k12.ma.us, and we can get you on a list to get to Kate Quinn over at the Recreation Center.

164
01:11:55,087 --> 01:12:02,070
[SPEAKER_07]: And then teachers Carla Andre and Michael Skorka at the high school shared with us their Common Ground program, which is really

165
01:12:02,550 --> 01:12:04,450
[SPEAKER_07]: about building horizontal friendships.

166
01:12:04,490 --> 01:12:13,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are friendships that are equal footing between students with and without disabilities and how that might be achieved in a thoughtful, meaningful way district-wide.

167
01:12:13,292 --> 01:12:17,993
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that conversation will continue as well on February 11th.

168
01:12:18,013 --> 01:12:23,054
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you are interested in any of those topics, please join us February 11th from 5 to 6.30.

169
01:12:23,374 --> 01:12:23,694
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

170
01:12:24,194 --> 01:12:26,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Member McLaughlin.

171
01:12:26,875 --> 01:12:27,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham?

172
01:12:30,363 --> 01:12:35,825
[SPEAKER_04]: In the minutes there's a reference to the PowerPoint about the homework survey.

173
01:12:36,405 --> 01:12:37,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Can that be shared with the committee?

174
01:12:39,126 --> 01:12:41,626
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, I actually we had asked Stacey Shulman.

175
01:12:41,646 --> 01:12:49,169
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if she's on the call if she would if she could do that, but I can certainly send an email again to share that it was a good presentation.

176
01:12:49,229 --> 01:12:56,551
[SPEAKER_07]: It was useful information and a lot to be said around defining sort of the terms of the survey.

177
01:12:57,311 --> 01:12:57,651
[SPEAKER_07]: So sure.

178
01:12:59,203 --> 01:13:00,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Member McLaughlin.

179
01:13:02,684 --> 01:13:03,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion for approval?

180
01:13:03,485 --> 01:13:05,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion.

181
01:13:05,746 --> 01:13:08,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Rousseau seconded by Member Van de Kloet.

182
01:13:08,907 --> 01:13:09,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call.

183
01:13:11,308 --> 01:13:11,828

184
01:13:12,568 --> 01:13:12,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

185
01:13:13,749 --> 01:13:14,329
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Graham?

186
01:13:14,789 --> 01:13:15,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

187
01:13:16,450 --> 01:13:17,390
[SPEAKER_07]: Member McLaughlin, yes.

188
01:13:17,410 --> 01:13:18,170
[SPEAKER_07]: Member McStone?

189
01:13:18,390 --> 01:13:18,631
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

190
01:13:20,331 --> 01:13:21,072
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Rousseau?

191
01:13:21,532 --> 01:13:21,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

192
01:13:22,772 --> 01:13:23,612
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Van de Kloet?

193
01:13:23,933 --> 01:13:24,173
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

194
01:13:25,733 --> 01:13:26,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Mayor Longo-Kern?

195
01:13:26,714 --> 01:13:26,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

196
01:13:28,881 --> 01:13:31,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Seven the affirmative, zero the negative, paper passes.

197
01:13:35,042 --> 01:13:37,242
[SPEAKER_06]: Number seven, we have community participation.

198
01:13:37,262 --> 01:13:38,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Mayor?

199
01:13:38,883 --> 01:13:40,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, yes.

200
01:13:40,403 --> 01:13:41,783
[SPEAKER_03]: There is one letter from the public.

201
01:13:44,444 --> 01:13:47,144
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me just read this and then we'll get right to that letter.

202
01:13:48,124 --> 01:13:55,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Public participation emails, questions or comments can be submitted during the meeting by emailing medfordsc at medford.k12.ma.us.

203
01:13:56,386 --> 01:13:57,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Those submitting must include

204
01:13:58,213 --> 01:14:02,415
[SPEAKER_06]: the following information, your first and last name, your Medford Street address, your question or comment.

205
01:14:03,115 --> 01:14:05,396
[SPEAKER_06]: And it looks like we have one email or a letter.

206
01:14:06,617 --> 01:14:12,000
[SPEAKER_03]: So this email, which came in at 3.49 this afternoon, says, hello all.

207
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:22,745
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't see it on the posted agenda, but I'm wondering if it is possible to get an update on the status of the formation of a committee to make plans for next steps of the Columbus name change.

208
01:14:23,687 --> 01:14:24,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

209
01:14:24,528 --> 01:14:27,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Submitted by Emma Heffron, 18 Curtis Street.

210
01:14:28,211 --> 01:14:30,353
[SPEAKER_03]: If you recall, we actually had a letter last week.

211
01:14:31,273 --> 01:14:35,297
[SPEAKER_03]: We did say that would be on, I thought it was going to be on today's agenda.

212
01:14:36,638 --> 01:14:43,463
[SPEAKER_03]: So perhaps I'd make a motion that we put it on next, at our next meeting's agenda.

213
01:14:46,205 --> 01:14:47,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to place this on our February 8th, 2021 agenda.

214
01:14:50,134 --> 01:14:53,576
[SPEAKER_06]: by member Van de Kloet, seconded by member Rousseau.

215
01:14:54,216 --> 01:14:55,737
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Rousseau.

216
01:14:56,578 --> 01:15:03,222
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually that is in the minutes that in the last meeting that exact motion was made and approved.

217
01:15:03,822 --> 01:15:10,046
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would just like to ask that somebody take a special note to make sure that really happens.

218
01:15:14,643 --> 01:15:19,425
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure it was just an oversight, but it was in the last meeting.

219
01:15:19,445 --> 01:15:21,306
[SPEAKER_11]: We voted exactly to do that for tonight.

220
01:15:21,826 --> 01:15:24,187
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, yep.

221
01:15:24,227 --> 01:15:24,968
[SPEAKER_06]: Member van de Kloet?

222
01:15:25,328 --> 01:15:32,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I also just wanted to announce that there's a curriculum subcommittee meeting this Wednesday from 4 to 6 p.m.

223
01:15:33,211 --> 01:15:37,433
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be discussing the global language program as well as technology.

224
01:15:39,802 --> 01:15:41,023
[SPEAKER_03]: One of our members can't come.

225
01:15:41,083 --> 01:15:45,166
[SPEAKER_03]: So if anybody else can, I'd love to have another member present.

226
01:15:45,486 --> 01:15:48,848
[SPEAKER_03]: If you'd let me know you're available, please, I would most appreciate that.

227
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:51,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.

228
01:15:51,590 --> 01:15:53,511
[SPEAKER_06]: You said four to six or six to eight?

229
01:15:53,992 --> 01:15:57,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Four to six Wednesday, this Wednesday, the 27th.

230
01:15:57,254 --> 01:15:57,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

231
01:15:58,535 --> 01:15:58,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

232
01:15:58,955 --> 01:16:00,256
[SPEAKER_06]: Member McLaughlin.

233
01:16:01,637 --> 01:16:01,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

234
01:16:02,037 --> 01:16:06,380
[SPEAKER_07]: And also just want to mention that the Medford Special Education Parent Advisory Council is having

235
01:16:06,935 --> 01:16:09,837
[SPEAKER_07]: our presentation Wednesday, February 11th.

236
01:16:11,859 --> 01:16:12,880
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's at 6 p.m.

237
01:16:12,940 --> 01:16:13,701
[SPEAKER_07]: on dyslexia.

238
01:16:15,202 --> 01:16:19,406
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know if that was in the, I don't wanna supersede it, the superintendent's announcement.

239
01:16:19,446 --> 01:16:25,411
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just wanted to mention that when member Van de Kloet was mentioning the other, but we have a motion on the floor.

240
01:16:26,772 --> 01:16:30,095
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion by member Van de Kloet, seconded by member Russo, roll call.

241
01:16:30,955 --> 01:16:31,576
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Kretz?

242
01:16:32,156 --> 01:16:32,397
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

243
01:16:33,337 --> 01:16:33,858
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Graham?

244
01:16:37,817 --> 01:16:39,599
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham, you are muted, sorry.

245
01:16:39,939 --> 01:16:40,179
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

246
01:16:41,801 --> 01:16:43,102
[SPEAKER_07]: Member McLaughlin, yes.

247
01:16:43,202 --> 01:16:44,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Member McStone?

248
01:16:44,403 --> 01:16:44,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

249
01:16:46,004 --> 01:16:46,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Russo?

250
01:16:47,886 --> 01:16:48,086
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

251
01:16:48,766 --> 01:16:49,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Van de Kloet?

252
01:16:49,967 --> 01:16:50,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

253
01:16:51,469 --> 01:16:52,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Mayor Longo Kern?

254
01:16:52,590 --> 01:16:54,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

255
01:16:55,532 --> 01:17:01,177
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to have the Columbus school name change discussion put on our February 8th meeting has been approved.

256
01:17:03,010 --> 01:17:04,771
[SPEAKER_06]: Number eight, report of superintendent.

257
01:17:04,891 --> 01:17:06,672
[SPEAKER_06]: Superintendent's updates and comments.

258
01:17:07,232 --> 01:17:08,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Edward-Vincent.

259
01:17:10,415 --> 01:17:11,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening, everyone.

260
01:17:14,417 --> 01:17:25,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Regardless of your political leading, as Maya Angelou stated at then President Obama's inaugural address, it's the dawn of a new day.

261
01:17:26,828 --> 01:17:36,694
[SPEAKER_02]: It was gratifying to see that at this inauguration, which has historically been a day of celebration for our country, was held without any issues.

262
01:17:38,377 --> 01:17:59,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Our democracy move forward to welcome a new president, Mr. Joseph Biden, our first ever female vice president, Kamala Harris, who also is the first African American and South Asian to serve in this role, as well as first lady, Dr. Jill Biden, who is a teacher.

263
01:18:01,557 --> 01:18:11,039
[SPEAKER_02]: I mention this because as a teacher myself, it is my feeling that there are lessons here for all of our students to learn from this leadership change.

264
01:18:12,279 --> 01:18:18,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Most notably is that at the highest seats of government, there are people who look like all of our students now.

265
01:18:20,741 --> 01:18:22,381
[SPEAKER_02]: The next lesson is resilience.

266
01:18:24,302 --> 01:18:28,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Senator Biden first ran for president in 1998 and again in 2008.

267
01:18:32,607 --> 01:18:34,628
[SPEAKER_02]: finally winning the seat in 2020.

268
01:18:35,829 --> 01:18:38,390
[SPEAKER_02]: He never gave up, he persevered.

269
01:18:39,590 --> 01:18:44,933
[SPEAKER_02]: It shows if you are willing to put in the work, you eventually attain your goals.

270
01:18:48,094 --> 01:18:55,358
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanna share that I was honored to take part along with Mayor Lungo Kern on a panel at the annual Martin Luther King Jr.

271
01:18:55,378 --> 01:18:55,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Luncheon.

272
01:18:57,430 --> 01:19:05,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Although this year the event had to be held virtually, it was a wonderful program with a lot of important voices and shared ideas.

273
01:19:06,839 --> 01:19:21,312
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to thank the Medford Human Rights Commission, the NAACP, the Royal House and Slave Quarters, Arts Medford, and the Director of Human Resources and Diversity, Neil Osborne, for inviting me.

274
01:19:22,523 --> 01:19:37,051
[SPEAKER_02]: On the panel, I participated with the mayor and three of our own CCSR students, Zane Youssef, Amin Nazi, and Liza Lopes, as well as with Mr. Osborne and other community members.

275
01:19:37,992 --> 01:19:47,117
[SPEAKER_02]: What we all heard loud and clear was the need to push, put our words into action in order to make our community a more welcoming place for all.

276
01:19:49,227 --> 01:20:12,846
[SPEAKER_02]: To that end, the Medford Public Schools Racial Equity Task Force garnered the attention from the Boston Globe, local media, and the Patch, highlighting its mission to research, examine, and make recommendations to maintain an anti-racist, equitable, and socially just school district for our students and school community at large.

277
01:20:14,177 --> 01:20:27,561
[SPEAKER_02]: I continue to express how important it is that we develop a strategic and a coordinated approach to address issues of equity, diversity, and inclusion within the Medford Public Schools.

278
01:20:28,902 --> 01:20:42,066
[SPEAKER_02]: It is gratifying to know that President Biden instructed federal agencies to prioritize racial equity and review policies that reinforce systemic racism.

279
01:20:43,348 --> 01:20:48,090
[SPEAKER_02]: We all need to work together to make substantive change in our country.

280
01:20:51,252 --> 01:21:06,899
[SPEAKER_02]: This week, on January 27th, it is International Holocaust Remembrance Day, and it will mark 75 years since the Allied troops liberated the Auschwitz death camp.

281
01:21:08,479 --> 01:21:09,320
[SPEAKER_02]: The Holocaust

282
01:21:10,362 --> 01:21:16,644
[SPEAKER_02]: The murder of 6 million Jews by the Nazis and their collaborators did not occur in a vacuum.

283
01:21:17,824 --> 01:21:21,605
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the product of unchecked hatred and collective silence.

284
01:21:23,486 --> 01:21:31,148
[SPEAKER_02]: While confronting this pandemic, we have seen a rise in hateful and racist ideologies around the world.

285
01:21:32,368 --> 01:21:35,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Let us all work to eradicate this hate in our society

286
01:21:36,564 --> 01:21:40,226
[SPEAKER_02]: and remember what the late Congressman John Lewis once said.

287
01:21:42,528 --> 01:21:45,309
[SPEAKER_02]: We are one people with one family.

288
01:21:46,090 --> 01:21:47,871
[SPEAKER_02]: We all live in the same house.

289
01:21:48,872 --> 01:21:57,077
[SPEAKER_02]: And through books, through information, we must find a way to say to people that we must lay down the burden of hate.

290
01:22:01,079 --> 01:22:03,321
[SPEAKER_02]: On a different note, I am pleased

291
01:22:04,267 --> 01:22:09,273
[SPEAKER_02]: to announce that our kindergarten registration has opened today.

292
01:22:10,575 --> 01:22:17,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Last Wednesday, Medford hosted its first Building Bridges to Kindergarten virtual presentation.

293
01:22:19,385 --> 01:22:22,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Special thanks go out to Assistant Superintendent Suzanne Galluzzi,

294
01:22:23,413 --> 01:22:37,240
[SPEAKER_02]: the Medford Family Network, and kindergarten teacher Maria Michelli, who not only provided important information for parents and guardians, but also answered questions and concerns that parents, guardians, and caregivers had.

295
01:22:38,461 --> 01:22:43,483
[SPEAKER_02]: We appreciate their assistance in welcoming new Mustangs into our district.

296
01:22:44,404 --> 01:22:50,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Our next Building Bridges presentation will be held on Wednesday, February 24th.

297
01:22:53,055 --> 01:22:57,597
[SPEAKER_02]: I also would like to take this moment to commend some of our CCSR students.

298
01:22:59,078 --> 01:23:12,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Andrea Cerebori and Daniel Morganti received a donation of $150 from Wegmans to help CCSR's food pantry, which is located at the Curtis Tufts High School.

299
01:23:14,205 --> 01:23:19,247
[SPEAKER_02]: We appreciate Wegmans as they have always been a wonderful community partner in Medford.

300
01:23:20,002 --> 01:23:24,985
[SPEAKER_02]: and CCSR continues to assist our schools' communities' needs.

301
01:23:25,805 --> 01:23:26,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mustangs.

302
01:23:28,887 --> 01:23:45,237
[SPEAKER_02]: This past month, Melina McGovern, a junior at Medford High School, has been collecting feminine products, general hygiene products, vanity items, and masks for local shelters in the Middlesex County area.

303
01:23:46,796 --> 01:23:54,705
[SPEAKER_02]: The main shelters that these items will be distributed to include the Women's Lunch Place and Massachusetts Homeless.

304
01:23:56,127 --> 01:24:01,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Melina is working in collaboration with the nonprofit organization called Her Drive.

305
01:24:02,955 --> 01:24:10,040
[SPEAKER_02]: Fox 25 News Boston interviewed Melina for a segment that will be on the Wednesday Night News.

306
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:15,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Another Mustang stepping forward to help those less fortunate.

307
01:24:15,803 --> 01:24:16,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Great job, Melina.

308
01:24:19,345 --> 01:24:27,931
[SPEAKER_02]: I also would be remiss if I didn't mention the remarkable Amanda Gordon, the National Youth Poet Laureate.

309
01:24:29,232 --> 01:24:32,494
[SPEAKER_02]: She clearly stole the show with her poem, The Hill We Climb.

310
01:24:34,170 --> 01:24:40,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Amanda found poetry in third grade and used it as a way to overcome her speech impediment.

311
01:24:41,634 --> 01:24:50,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks to CCSR, Medford was blessed to have Amanda speak to our Andrews and McGlynn eighth grade students in 2019.

312
01:24:52,019 --> 01:25:00,543
[SPEAKER_02]: During the assembly, Amanda recited her own award-winning poetry and performed her own rap lyrics.

313
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:14,066
[SPEAKER_02]: In the spirit of Amanda Gordon, in my weekly communication this past Friday, I invited students of all grade levels to participate in the Mustang Poetry Contest.

314
01:25:15,246 --> 01:25:22,310
[SPEAKER_02]: All students are welcome to participate in this contest by submitting a poem up to 10 lines on the topic of unity.

315
01:25:24,272 --> 01:25:35,879
[SPEAKER_02]: I ask that students submit their poems to the following email, superintendent at medford.k12.ma.us by February 22nd.

316
01:25:37,019 --> 01:25:43,043
[SPEAKER_02]: A winner will be chosen from both our hybrid cohorts, as well as our remote cohorts.

317
01:25:43,543 --> 01:25:48,926
[SPEAKER_02]: And both will have opportunities to share their poetry at the March 8th school committee meeting.

318
01:25:50,249 --> 01:25:54,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Other submissions will be shared on our website platform.

319
01:25:56,391 --> 01:26:06,455
[SPEAKER_02]: To my happy surprise, in my email on Saturday morning, I received my very first entry in the contest.

320
01:26:07,916 --> 01:26:18,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Believe it or not, this wonderful student who was so eager had to do the assignment, which was voluntary, comes to us from a wonderful first grade classroom.

321
01:26:19,555 --> 01:26:21,897
[SPEAKER_02]: I can already see her achieving high heights.

322
01:26:23,478 --> 01:26:25,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Her name is Shelby Espinola.

323
01:26:26,340 --> 01:26:31,383
[SPEAKER_02]: She's a first grade student in Mrs. Fargo's classroom at the Brooks School.

324
01:26:32,964 --> 01:26:38,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Please indulge me as I share her poem, the very first poem on unity.

325
01:26:39,368 --> 01:26:41,289
[SPEAKER_02]: She wrote this poem for the community.

326
01:26:42,891 --> 01:26:46,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are the leaders.

327
01:26:47,575 --> 01:26:51,419
[SPEAKER_02]: Kamala Harris is the first woman to be the vice president.

328
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:58,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Joe Biden is going to help our community by taking care of corona.

329
01:26:59,967 --> 01:27:02,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hope they help our world.

330
01:27:05,435 --> 01:27:06,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Great job, Shelby.

331
01:27:07,216 --> 01:27:13,320
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot wait to read all the poems that will come in between now and February 22nd.

332
01:27:13,940 --> 01:27:24,667
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just had to share Shelby's poem and say, I was so excited and surprised to see that I had someone that eager, willing, and wanting to jump in and do the poem.

333
01:27:24,887 --> 01:27:32,191
[SPEAKER_02]: And I encourage anyone in our Mustang nation who wants to participate, up to 10 lines, do the poem.

334
01:27:32,672 --> 01:27:33,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

335
01:27:33,232 --> 01:27:34,913
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are my announcements for today.

336
01:27:36,188 --> 01:27:37,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

337
01:27:38,009 --> 01:27:38,970
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we just had Ms.

338
01:27:39,050 --> 01:27:41,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Fargo dancing in excitement for her.

339
01:27:41,432 --> 01:27:42,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out, yes.

340
01:27:42,513 --> 01:27:44,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for her students, so that was pretty cool.

341
01:27:45,436 --> 01:27:46,877
[SPEAKER_06]: Appreciate that.

342
01:27:47,717 --> 01:27:48,398
[SPEAKER_06]: Great remarks.

343
01:27:49,479 --> 01:27:55,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Number two, we have COVID-19 public health update and Medford Public School COVID-19 testing summary and update.

344
01:27:56,365 --> 01:27:57,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Nurse supervisor, Ms.

345
01:27:57,586 --> 01:27:58,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Toni Ray, Ms.

346
01:27:59,127 --> 01:28:02,950
[SPEAKER_06]: Marianne O'Connor, our board of health director, and Mr. David Murphy.

347
01:28:05,385 --> 01:28:07,345
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening, Medford school community.

348
01:28:08,266 --> 01:28:13,547
[SPEAKER_00]: Marianne O'Connor is not with us this evening, so I will share a few notes from her.

349
01:28:14,947 --> 01:28:20,209
[SPEAKER_00]: Medford does remain in the red zone, but recently we are seeing very encouraging signs.

350
01:28:20,889 --> 01:28:24,770
[SPEAKER_00]: The number of positive daily cases has been decreasing steadily.

351
01:28:24,790 --> 01:28:28,511
[SPEAKER_00]: And today we had the lowest number since November.

352
01:28:28,531 --> 01:28:32,191
[SPEAKER_00]: And our percent positivity rate, which is 5.02%,

353
01:28:35,080 --> 01:28:41,101
[SPEAKER_00]: um, is lower, um, as compared to the last, um, weekly department of public health report.

354
01:28:42,141 --> 01:28:49,943
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so we are, we are encouraged to start to see this, um, trend moving downward in the Medford public schools.

355
01:28:50,223 --> 01:28:54,444
[SPEAKER_00]: We, um, our positive cases mirrored what was happening in the community.

356
01:28:54,864 --> 01:29:00,265
[SPEAKER_00]: They rose steadily throughout December and early January, and we are starting to see a decline now.

357
01:29:03,513 --> 01:29:06,874
[SPEAKER_00]: In January, we have seen no evidence of in-school transmission.

358
01:29:07,354 --> 01:29:12,457
[SPEAKER_00]: Families are keeping students home when they're ill, and we are very appreciative of that.

359
01:29:13,657 --> 01:29:19,160
[SPEAKER_00]: Our routine surveillance testing resumed prior to the entry of students back into school.

360
01:29:19,980 --> 01:29:25,423
[SPEAKER_00]: And in last week's testing, we identified less than six positive cases.

361
01:29:26,470 --> 01:29:32,793
[SPEAKER_00]: The testing is staffed by the school nurses and the Northeastern student nurses, and it's running smoothly and efficiently.

362
01:29:33,614 --> 01:29:37,956
[SPEAKER_00]: With Friday, we had 1,070 tests that we completed.

363
01:29:42,378 --> 01:29:52,503
[SPEAKER_00]: For the phase one of the vaccination effort by the state, the school nurses have been vaccinated as COVID facing healthcare professionals.

364
01:29:53,642 --> 01:30:02,227
[SPEAKER_00]: The related service providers and behavioral health providers have been vaccinated as non-COVID facing healthcare.

365
01:30:03,348 --> 01:30:11,313
[SPEAKER_00]: Educators have been defined as being in phase two, which vaccinations should commence at some point in mid February through March.

366
01:30:11,973 --> 01:30:18,337
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can obtain the schedule on mass.gov backslash COVID-19 vaccine.

367
01:30:22,309 --> 01:30:40,938
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, the Department of Education on their weekly update reported that the department expects to receive further written information about the vaccine rollout for educators from the Executive Office of Health and Human Services, Department of Public Health by the end of the week.

368
01:30:41,699 --> 01:30:49,242
[SPEAKER_00]: As we receive information from the Department of Public Health, we will make this available to all the educators within our system.

369
01:30:50,203 --> 01:30:50,583
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

370
01:30:52,828 --> 01:30:54,729
[SPEAKER_12]: Mayor, I was just going to follow up.

371
01:30:54,809 --> 01:31:00,031
[SPEAKER_12]: Last week we shared with the committee our ongoing efforts related to consent forms.

372
01:31:00,652 --> 01:31:06,654
[SPEAKER_12]: There were some questions at that time related to our consent forms by cohort.

373
01:31:07,115 --> 01:31:14,838
[SPEAKER_12]: So we've accumulated that data and do have it by school as well and be circulating that to the committee later in the week.

374
01:31:14,958 --> 01:31:18,860
[SPEAKER_12]: So these numbers are fluid, both because the consent forms continue to come in.

375
01:31:19,420 --> 01:31:25,643
[SPEAKER_12]: And our participation in the program, at least participation as defined by consent forms, continues to rise.

376
01:31:26,584 --> 01:31:42,692
[SPEAKER_12]: With the high school cohorts who have just come into in-person instruction over the last several weeks, that's where we're seeing our percentages of consent forms being the lowest, which would be expected.

377
01:31:42,913 --> 01:31:47,435
[SPEAKER_12]: And we'll continue to push and promote the program so that we

378
01:31:47,936 --> 01:31:49,696
[SPEAKER_12]: continue to increase participation.

379
01:31:50,136 --> 01:31:56,438
[SPEAKER_12]: You'll see that the overall participation rate is in the low 80s, which is what we had reported on a couple of weeks ago.

380
01:31:57,438 --> 01:32:11,781
[SPEAKER_12]: But I would just note that given that these numbers now include the three grade levels who have just come in, as I just referenced, the fact that we're maintaining that percentage is an encouraging sign because it means that we are, relatively speaking, keeping pace.

381
01:32:12,521 --> 01:32:16,902
[SPEAKER_12]: The high school, again, is where we have the lowest percentage of consent forms, but that's to be expected.

382
01:32:17,640 --> 01:32:20,401
[SPEAKER_12]: and we'll continue to work on that over the next several weeks.

383
01:32:20,781 --> 01:32:25,863
[SPEAKER_12]: We are at this point tentatively planning to transition to pool testing next week.

384
01:32:27,684 --> 01:32:35,987
[SPEAKER_12]: I probably would have said that two weeks ago about this week, but we decided to hold off for one more week due to some logistical challenges that we were facing.

385
01:32:36,547 --> 01:32:42,829
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we'll be communicating out to the community and to staff what the implications of that transition means.

386
01:32:43,009 --> 01:32:45,610
[SPEAKER_12]: As we've spoken about in this forum in the past,

387
01:32:46,070 --> 01:33:14,615
[SPEAKER_12]: The primary difference when we switch from individual testing to pool testing is that those in a positive pool will be identified the day after the pool test, and will be directed to go to a testing site for what we call a reflex test, which will be a testing station open in Medford for, I expect it's gonna be three hours a day, at least to start, six days a week, and that will give

388
01:33:15,045 --> 01:33:22,607
[SPEAKER_12]: those in a positive pool the opportunity to be essentially cleared to reenter the school buildings within a short period of time.

389
01:33:26,488 --> 01:33:34,530
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the most important, just in terms of where we're, important data with regard to where we're headed with regards to the testing program going forward.

390
01:33:35,711 --> 01:33:40,392
[SPEAKER_12]: We have, we still have a few details to work out on the pool testing, which is why we haven't

391
01:33:40,830 --> 01:33:45,232
[SPEAKER_12]: communicated en masse on that yet, but hopefully we'll be doing that in the next several days.

392
01:33:45,572 --> 01:33:46,553
[SPEAKER_12]: Happy to answer any questions.

393
01:33:46,613 --> 01:33:50,515
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, this data, I know there were questions about by cohort and by school.

394
01:33:50,915 --> 01:33:52,276
[SPEAKER_12]: You can see it here by cohort.

395
01:33:52,676 --> 01:33:56,758
[SPEAKER_12]: We have it by school and we'll be sharing that with you over the next several days.

396
01:33:57,158 --> 01:34:04,382
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, note that the data is fluid, both because there's some people moving in and out of cohorts and because there are consent forms that are coming in.

397
01:34:04,402 --> 01:34:08,484
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to take this off, but happy to reshare it if anyone has questions about it.

398
01:34:09,505 --> 01:34:10,165
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

399
01:34:11,424 --> 01:34:12,865
[SPEAKER_06]: for providing that data.

400
01:34:12,885 --> 01:34:17,589
[SPEAKER_06]: If there's no questions, thank you, Ms.

401
01:34:17,629 --> 01:34:19,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Ray, Mr. Murphy for the update.

402
01:34:20,051 --> 01:34:20,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Musso.

403
01:34:22,113 --> 01:34:22,933
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, sorry.

404
01:34:23,254 --> 01:34:25,395
[SPEAKER_11]: I know so many little tiles, it's hard to see everybody.

405
01:34:26,696 --> 01:34:37,165
[SPEAKER_11]: I just had a question about when we get our communication from the superintendent, which I believe goes up to the public as well, about the number of tests and the number of positives, this is wonderful information.

406
01:34:37,185 --> 01:34:40,748
[SPEAKER_11]: This January, it's always been very, very good.

407
01:34:41,913 --> 01:34:54,919
[SPEAKER_11]: But looking at the number of consented students in the cohorts that was just shown, it just dawned on me that when you say there's been a thousand tests and we've had four positives, for instance, that includes staff.

408
01:34:56,699 --> 01:35:10,345
[SPEAKER_11]: And one of the things I cannot deduce in any way, shape or form is if cohort A is tested, some of them are tested with cohort B, some of them are tested with cohort C, correct?

409
01:35:10,824 --> 01:35:12,525
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of them are Tuesday and some of them are Friday.

410
01:35:13,046 --> 01:35:16,709
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't know of a thousand tests.

411
01:35:18,070 --> 01:35:31,580
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not actually concerned that staff aren't getting tested, but if there were 980 students who should have been tested on Friday, were there 980 students that were tested on Friday?

412
01:35:31,921 --> 01:35:34,423
[SPEAKER_11]: Or were there 600 students that were tested?

413
01:35:34,603 --> 01:35:37,445
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a critical piece of information that is completely

414
01:35:39,182 --> 01:35:42,303
[SPEAKER_11]: impossible to deduce from the information that I have at this point.

415
01:35:43,363 --> 01:35:44,364
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I think that's true.

416
01:35:44,384 --> 01:35:46,304
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think that information is contained in here.

417
01:35:46,624 --> 01:35:59,808
[SPEAKER_12]: What I can tell you is that these numbers do fluctuate from week to week, both because the total pool of students who are eligible to be tested is increasing, and because the numbers just have varied from week to week.

418
01:35:59,848 --> 01:36:04,550
[SPEAKER_12]: And that has to do with who is actually coming into school.

419
01:36:05,168 --> 01:36:08,830
[SPEAKER_12]: And there is some variability at the secondary level with regard to student participation.

420
01:36:08,890 --> 01:36:16,574
[SPEAKER_12]: That is a operational issue that we knew was going to occur at the secondary level based on how the testing is scheduled.

421
01:36:17,034 --> 01:36:24,218
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's something that we're going to be looking at over the coming days to try to essentially bridge whatever gap currently exists.

422
01:36:24,759 --> 01:36:29,541
[SPEAKER_12]: Our focus initially was on getting the consent form participation up as high as possible.

423
01:36:29,961 --> 01:36:32,223
[SPEAKER_12]: Our goal is still 100% with regard to that.

424
01:36:32,543 --> 01:36:34,184
[SPEAKER_12]: If you were to back out grades 9, 10, and 11 of this,

425
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:40,681
[SPEAKER_12]: we're closer than this data would suggest with regard to consent form participation.

426
01:36:41,561 --> 01:36:47,482
[SPEAKER_12]: Our numbers are steady at elementary and middle school because the students are, because of the way in which it's operationalized.

427
01:36:47,842 --> 01:36:51,483
[SPEAKER_12]: At high school, there are different challenges, different schedule, different reality.

428
01:36:52,363 --> 01:36:55,844
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we have to sort of work on that in the coming days and weeks.

429
01:36:55,904 --> 01:37:00,484
[SPEAKER_12]: And we'll be working with the high school team to see how we can perfect that.

430
01:37:01,385 --> 01:37:03,885
[SPEAKER_12]: So that you're correctly identifying a gap

431
01:37:04,491 --> 01:37:05,271
[SPEAKER_12]: that exists there.

432
01:37:05,671 --> 01:37:14,633
[SPEAKER_12]: With respect to the cohort A students, we have frankly gone back and forth a little bit as to whether or not those students should be tested once a week or twice a week.

433
01:37:15,273 --> 01:37:31,317
[SPEAKER_12]: With the reduction in financial cost, at least our team, and I say our team, and frankly, basically, this is information that's coming out of a meeting with just myself and Tony as the head of health services and our partners at Tufts,

434
01:37:32,279 --> 01:37:41,702
[SPEAKER_12]: I expect our position will be that the cohort A students will test or have a test available to them twice a week.

435
01:37:42,002 --> 01:37:44,983
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a marginal cost difference that we've calculated.

436
01:37:45,663 --> 01:38:00,187
[SPEAKER_12]: And those students are in the school environment twice as often as students who are only in, you know, in cohorts B and C. And therefore, I think it's logical that they would have the opportunity to test twice as much.

437
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:08,606
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, given that we've estimated it's a now, given the pool testing, a marginal budgetary impact, that's what I expect would happen.

438
01:38:08,946 --> 01:38:11,788
[SPEAKER_12]: I think you'll see a bridging of that gap once that occurs.

439
01:38:12,228 --> 01:38:18,433
[SPEAKER_12]: I can tell you that in terms of unique tests, we typically do about 1,000 on Tuesdays and 1,000 on Fridays.

440
01:38:18,913 --> 01:38:22,035
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're about 1,700 or so unique tests a week.

441
01:38:22,075 --> 01:38:25,198
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's made up of staff and students, mostly staff.

442
01:38:25,758 --> 01:38:30,041
[SPEAKER_12]: But the cohort that is testing twice a week is typically a few hundred.

443
01:38:31,738 --> 01:38:39,982
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, there's just one word, Mr. Murphy, that you used that I think we need to be careful around and available.

444
01:38:40,362 --> 01:38:56,911
[SPEAKER_11]: If I'm a parent sending my kid to school and I have signed that consent form, that parent I am gonna go out on a limb is assuming with an incredibly high level of confidence that their student is getting tested every single time that they are supposed to get tested.

445
01:38:57,631 --> 01:38:59,192
[SPEAKER_11]: And if I found out that,

446
01:38:59,882 --> 01:39:10,187
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, my high school student is going to school and for scheduling and lines and whatever other reason, they've been going all for the last two weeks and have never actually gotten tested.

447
01:39:10,967 --> 01:39:14,389
[SPEAKER_11]: I would, I would actually not send my kid to school the next day.

448
01:39:15,649 --> 01:39:17,090
[SPEAKER_11]: So it can't be available.

449
01:39:17,210 --> 01:39:26,754
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to know that a hundred percent of kids that parents have signed a consent, they've not signed a consent form, meaning like, if you can think about it and get around to it, maybe you should test my kid.

450
01:39:27,255 --> 01:39:27,795
[SPEAKER_11]: They're saying,

451
01:39:28,309 --> 01:39:32,312
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm consenting to this testing and I think it's okay to send my kid into the building.

452
01:39:32,813 --> 01:39:40,939
[SPEAKER_11]: And part of my logic is it's safe for my student because I know that they're getting regular testing and so is everybody else.

453
01:39:42,741 --> 01:39:48,065
[SPEAKER_11]: And so we need to tighten this up so that we have no kids slipping through the cracks.

454
01:39:48,205 --> 01:39:56,192
[SPEAKER_11]: If the cohort A students are available on Tuesdays and Fridays for testing, we have to decide

455
01:39:56,960 --> 01:40:02,162
[SPEAKER_11]: is it going to be that they get tested both days or they have to be tested on one of those days?

456
01:40:02,382 --> 01:40:05,883
[SPEAKER_11]: Because otherwise we can't do any check that they actually got any test at all.

457
01:40:07,024 --> 01:40:15,747
[SPEAKER_11]: And I mean, the idea that there could be students who've been going to school, who've gotten consents and have just never been tested.

458
01:40:16,927 --> 01:40:17,707
[SPEAKER_11]: That is what I hear.

459
01:40:18,028 --> 01:40:23,089
[SPEAKER_11]: It's possible that you have gone to school and consented and you've actually never gotten the test, correct?

460
01:40:25,363 --> 01:40:26,203
[SPEAKER_12]: It's possible.

461
01:40:26,243 --> 01:40:27,424
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's very unlikely.

462
01:40:27,464 --> 01:40:29,345
[SPEAKER_12]: And if it's the case, it's very few.

463
01:40:29,365 --> 01:40:42,332
[SPEAKER_12]: I would say that my choice of the word available is in part because within the high school pool, there are students who have reached the age of majority and therefore can consent themselves.

464
01:40:42,732 --> 01:40:51,796
[SPEAKER_12]: And therefore they can have, we can have them on record as having issued consent and they can choose of their own volition to not test.

465
01:40:53,207 --> 01:41:06,994
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that you are absolutely correct that we have to tighten the operation of the testing at the secondary level to make sure that it is not sort of a strictly on the spectrum of the continuum of voluntary versus compulsory.

466
01:41:07,334 --> 01:41:10,936
[SPEAKER_12]: We have to move toward compulsory because it is an expectation.

467
01:41:11,016 --> 01:41:16,659
[SPEAKER_12]: I think you're right about families and parents expectations and we want to meet those expectations.

468
01:41:17,159 --> 01:41:22,882
[SPEAKER_12]: There are some practical limitations at the high school level that don't exist at the elementary school level.

469
01:41:23,272 --> 01:41:25,633
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think we have to find a way to overcome those limitations.

470
01:41:27,355 --> 01:41:27,655
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

471
01:41:27,735 --> 01:41:35,420
[SPEAKER_11]: And my last thing here, I understand that there are limitations around, especially the high school population and certainly the population that has reached the age of 18.

472
01:41:37,161 --> 01:41:41,984
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think that as a parent, I would want some transparency around that.

473
01:41:42,544 --> 01:41:43,485
[SPEAKER_11]: There were a thousand tests.

474
01:41:43,525 --> 01:41:47,247
[SPEAKER_11]: There were 12 students at the high school who didn't get tested this week.

475
01:41:48,372 --> 01:41:55,955
[SPEAKER_11]: And next week, if three of those students didn't get tested last week, we should say there are 12 students this week who didn't get tested.

476
01:41:55,995 --> 01:41:56,855
[SPEAKER_11]: Who could have gotten tested?

477
01:41:56,895 --> 01:41:58,055
[SPEAKER_11]: Who went to school with your kids?

478
01:41:58,555 --> 01:42:01,456
[SPEAKER_11]: And there were three who haven't been tested for the last two weeks.

479
01:42:01,857 --> 01:42:14,441
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it seems like an insane amount of data and it may be challenging, but parents have made, many parents have made an incredibly difficult decision to choose between their education

480
01:42:15,662 --> 01:42:18,523
[SPEAKER_11]: and the mental health consequences of going to school.

481
01:42:18,943 --> 01:42:24,065
[SPEAKER_11]: And some of those people have made those decisions even though they have high risk people in their houses.

482
01:42:25,045 --> 01:42:33,028
[SPEAKER_11]: And they have put themselves at an incredible risk because they think that the risk is mitigated by what we're doing.

483
01:42:33,528 --> 01:42:37,390
[SPEAKER_11]: So we can't have gaps that we find out afterwards.

484
01:42:37,490 --> 01:42:43,232
[SPEAKER_11]: And I realized that the ability to track in-school transmission does depend on a very high level

485
01:42:45,473 --> 01:42:51,534
[SPEAKER_11]: affirmative and confirmative testing is actually happening for the students that are consented.

486
01:42:51,574 --> 01:42:57,555
[SPEAKER_11]: So I appreciate that you recognize this area needs to be tightened up and we'll work on that.

487
01:42:57,675 --> 01:42:58,015
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

488
01:42:58,356 --> 01:42:59,156
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely, thank you.

489
01:42:59,636 --> 01:43:01,236
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Van de Kloethe, Member McLaughlin.

490
01:43:05,597 --> 01:43:07,877
[SPEAKER_03]: We received a letter from a member of the public.

491
01:43:08,617 --> 01:43:10,138
[SPEAKER_03]: This is from Leticia Roca.

492
01:43:12,008 --> 01:43:16,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, my name is Leticia Roca of 3610 Mystic Valley Parkway.

493
01:43:17,369 --> 01:43:20,550
[SPEAKER_03]: I have the following questions regarding the public health updates.

494
01:43:21,390 --> 01:43:29,392
[SPEAKER_03]: One, where exactly can we find updated data about the number of staff members and students that have tested positive across the different schools?

495
01:43:30,092 --> 01:43:31,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this on the school website?

496
01:43:32,092 --> 01:43:40,054
[SPEAKER_03]: This was talked about multiple times during these meetings, but I've yet to see this information divulged consistently online in an accessible manner.

497
01:43:40,989 --> 01:43:43,910
[SPEAKER_03]: Two, Tufts students are returning to campus.

498
01:43:44,410 --> 01:43:48,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Will you continue to calculate the Medford positivity rate without Tufts tests?

499
01:43:48,851 --> 01:43:52,231
[SPEAKER_03]: And where will this updated information be publicized consistently?

500
01:43:53,092 --> 01:44:02,093
[SPEAKER_03]: And then three, has it been officially established that families have the option for remote only learning for the rest of this school year until June?

501
01:44:03,574 --> 01:44:07,535
[SPEAKER_03]: If yes, where can we find this official statement by the MPS administration?

502
01:44:07,995 --> 01:44:09,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Regards, Leticia.

503
01:44:11,914 --> 01:44:12,814
[SPEAKER_06]: I can take number two.

504
01:44:12,834 --> 01:44:21,557
[SPEAKER_06]: The state will still calculate our positivity rate, including Tufts data that they release every Thursday.

505
01:44:23,917 --> 01:44:36,341
[SPEAKER_06]: The data on the website, I'm not sure exactly who's putting that on on a weekly basis, but... Yeah, I think the answer is the number one and three is yes and yes.

506
01:44:36,381 --> 01:44:40,162
[SPEAKER_12]: The remote option is for the remainder of the school year and it is on the website.

507
01:44:41,400 --> 01:44:43,482
[SPEAKER_12]: If you go to the main page, there's a tab there.

508
01:44:43,602 --> 01:44:45,724
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe it is up to date.

509
01:44:46,745 --> 01:44:59,638
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd like to not navigate the website on live TV, because the last time I did that, it didn't work out well, but I will certainly double check it and make sure that it's where we want it to be.

510
01:45:00,279 --> 01:45:00,479
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

511
01:45:00,699 --> 01:45:01,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much, Mr. Murphy.

512
01:45:01,940 --> 01:45:02,281
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

513
01:45:03,862 --> 01:45:04,603
[SPEAKER_06]: Member McLaughlin?

514
01:45:07,045 --> 01:45:07,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

515
01:45:08,786 --> 01:45:21,630
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Murphy, during the testing for COVID test, don't we as parents get results from our children's tests within 24 hours, a notification of their results so that we would therefore know whether they were tested or not?

516
01:45:22,390 --> 01:45:27,571
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we don't get the results, then we can assume that they had not been tested?

517
01:45:29,052 --> 01:45:31,313
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, hopefully it's much less than 24 hours.

518
01:45:31,333 --> 01:45:32,673
[SPEAKER_12]: And it typically is, but yes.

519
01:45:34,355 --> 01:45:36,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, so that was confusing for me.

520
01:45:36,957 --> 01:45:40,400
[SPEAKER_07]: So then we do know who is and who is not getting tested.

521
01:45:42,001 --> 01:45:46,145
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, and even absent the parent data we have that we can generate that.

522
01:45:47,326 --> 01:45:51,990
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, that's how I know it's about 1700 unique tests per day, I'm sorry, per week.

523
01:45:52,770 --> 01:45:58,195
[SPEAKER_06]: And you would think that almost everybody that is signed up to get tested is getting tested, so.

524
01:45:58,395 --> 01:46:03,019
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know that there's the biggest gap is at high school, which is again, not a surprise.

525
01:46:04,085 --> 01:46:13,293
[SPEAKER_12]: not a reflection on the high school's community's lack of commitment, but is absolutely indicative of the need to tighten how we're administering at the high school level.

526
01:46:14,854 --> 01:46:19,478
[SPEAKER_12]: It is the nature of sort of the different age groups is part of the issue.

527
01:46:20,499 --> 01:46:32,049
[SPEAKER_12]: So it is, the schedule presents a sort of a second challenge and a very significant one, but I don't want there to be any impression that because it's harder to reach a higher percentage at the high school, that somehow we are

528
01:46:32,803 --> 01:46:38,086
[SPEAKER_12]: acquiescing and saying, well, guess 65% will have to be good enough or whatever the case may be.

529
01:46:38,666 --> 01:46:46,910
[SPEAKER_12]: I would just say that we have more experience, frankly, doing this at the elementary and middle school level than we do at the high school because we've just only had the cohorts in for about a week or so.

530
01:46:47,310 --> 01:46:48,991
[SPEAKER_12]: But we have to bridge the gap.

531
01:46:49,471 --> 01:46:51,372
[SPEAKER_12]: I will say that, and I'll just add to that point really quickly.

532
01:46:51,412 --> 01:47:00,197
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry, I don't mean to belabor this, but it's where we have the greatest risk in many respects because of the independent nature of teenagers' lives.

533
01:47:00,617 --> 01:47:00,917
[SPEAKER_12]: And so

534
01:47:01,518 --> 01:47:10,467
[SPEAKER_12]: the urgency is there, and I know it's shared by the high school team, and we're going to work to make sure that we position the school to bridge that gap.

535
01:47:11,168 --> 01:47:11,688
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

536
01:47:11,728 --> 01:47:11,889
[SPEAKER_12]: Ms.

537
01:47:11,929 --> 01:47:12,149
[SPEAKER_00]: Ray?

538
01:47:12,950 --> 01:47:14,471
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to add one more thing.

539
01:47:14,511 --> 01:47:23,701
[SPEAKER_00]: The only other situation where parents will not receive test results is if a test is determined to be what's called

540
01:47:24,535 --> 01:47:27,158
[SPEAKER_00]: TNP, or test not performed.

541
01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:30,842
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a list of those every week.

542
01:47:30,862 --> 01:47:38,391
[SPEAKER_00]: I email every single parent or staff member who receives a TNP value.

543
01:47:40,253 --> 01:47:53,699
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually that occurs because the specimen doesn't have enough, there's not enough specimen to test, or by some chance the little swab was put in incorrectly into the vacutainer.

544
01:47:54,660 --> 01:48:06,425
[SPEAKER_00]: So parents are notified of that and advised that if their child is not feeling ill, they may come to school and test at the next regularly scheduled testing date.

545
01:48:06,485 --> 01:48:07,506
[SPEAKER_00]: We run about 20,

546
01:48:08,446 --> 01:48:10,386
[SPEAKER_00]: TNPs every testing period.

547
01:48:12,567 --> 01:48:13,027
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Ms.

548
01:48:13,067 --> 01:48:13,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Ray.

549
01:48:15,547 --> 01:48:21,789
[SPEAKER_06]: On to number three, we have report on freshman orientation and the return of hybrid students grade 9 through 11.

550
01:48:23,169 --> 01:48:26,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Principal Paul DeLeva and Principal Chad Fallon.

551
01:48:26,070 --> 01:48:32,011
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I see Chad, but anyway, thank you for having me, school committee.

552
01:48:33,748 --> 01:48:37,050
[SPEAKER_01]: just want to review regarding what we did for in-person.

553
01:48:37,090 --> 01:48:47,875
[SPEAKER_01]: As you know, the high school was one of the last schools to get into our in-person learning within the building itself.

554
01:48:48,135 --> 01:48:50,557
[SPEAKER_01]: And before I get started, I do want to thank a few people.

555
01:48:51,977 --> 01:48:55,319
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely want to thank the building admin team, Mr. Chad Fallon,

556
01:48:56,177 --> 01:48:57,618
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. David Blauk, Ms.

557
01:48:57,638 --> 01:48:58,719
[SPEAKER_01]: Gail Trainor, Ms.

558
01:48:58,739 --> 01:48:59,800
[SPEAKER_01]: Fitzpatrick, Ms.

559
01:48:59,940 --> 01:49:13,810
[SPEAKER_01]: Charose Walker, we constantly meet twice a week to make sure that things are being upheld or what changes need to be made, especially with having people that came into the building.

560
01:49:15,731 --> 01:49:19,734
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always things, what we had in theory doesn't always work out in practice.

561
01:49:19,795 --> 01:49:22,577
[SPEAKER_01]: So things that might occur that we need to readjust,

562
01:49:23,497 --> 01:49:29,079
[SPEAKER_01]: We tend to review that every twice a week, once on Monday and once on Friday as well.

563
01:49:29,879 --> 01:49:38,041
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to share my screen here and basically go over a presentation that you should have received as well.

564
01:49:42,002 --> 01:49:43,083
[SPEAKER_01]: So in order to

565
01:49:45,512 --> 01:49:49,077
[SPEAKER_01]: to go over things to make sure that we could have a good transition.

566
01:49:49,697 --> 01:49:52,641
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that we did as a building admin team.

567
01:49:53,182 --> 01:49:57,407
[SPEAKER_01]: We had two family forums on January 12, they were from 630 to 730.

568
01:49:57,607 --> 01:50:03,975
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Rose Walker really hosted the grade nine while Mr. Chad Fallon and myself were in support.

569
01:50:04,796 --> 01:50:05,956
[SPEAKER_01]: of that presentation.

570
01:50:06,297 --> 01:50:08,397
[SPEAKER_01]: Meanwhile, Mr. David Blau, Ms.

571
01:50:08,597 --> 01:50:09,798
[SPEAKER_01]: Alice Bessford-Patrick, and Ms.

572
01:50:09,838 --> 01:50:14,960
[SPEAKER_01]: Treanor were overseeing the 10th, 11th, and 12th grade forums as well.

573
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:23,182
[SPEAKER_01]: Both same presentation, but we definitely wanted to give more of a in-depth for our ninth grade as they had never been into the building.

574
01:50:23,202 --> 01:50:25,183
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

575
01:50:27,030 --> 01:50:45,207
[SPEAKER_01]: So as we said, this was a zoom presentation and when we reviewed we almost had a total of 100 participation participants in each forum that would be the ninth grade forum, as well as the 10th grade forum so about 100 each so we're talking about 200 people that attended and obviously we did this over zoom.

576
01:50:47,459 --> 01:50:54,563
[SPEAKER_01]: The next day was one of our most important days because as we were bringing people in, we realized we needed to have a freshman orientation.

577
01:50:55,103 --> 01:50:59,345
[SPEAKER_01]: This was sort of discussed when the dynamic learning plan came out.

578
01:51:00,166 --> 01:51:04,288
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to wait for the opportunity to actually have students in the building.

579
01:51:04,348 --> 01:51:08,331
[SPEAKER_01]: So having our freshman orientation, what we did was we did four

580
01:51:09,111 --> 01:51:22,861
[SPEAKER_01]: groups alpha split based on cohort B. And as you can see there, we also had optional days for cohort D. We wanted to make sure, even though there were students that were remote, that they could participate in our orientation.

581
01:51:22,922 --> 01:51:31,268
[SPEAKER_01]: Same with cohort A. Even though cohort A had been within the building prior to this, we also wanted them to have the same kind of orientation

582
01:51:31,828 --> 01:51:33,049
[SPEAKER_01]: that other students were having.

583
01:51:33,069 --> 01:51:34,490
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a long day.

584
01:51:34,550 --> 01:51:41,255
[SPEAKER_01]: Normally, we tend to do a half day, you know, everyone in the building, if you remember, prior to school starting.

585
01:51:42,676 --> 01:51:48,840
[SPEAKER_01]: And our idea of the format was that, you know, we started off in the theater,

586
01:51:50,331 --> 01:51:51,032
[SPEAKER_01]: Seats were marked.

587
01:51:51,132 --> 01:51:56,136
[SPEAKER_01]: We made sure that everyone was social distance, so we had a small group of students each time.

588
01:51:56,836 --> 01:52:02,440
[SPEAKER_01]: We definitely discussed our expectations, which I'll review again, and what our COVID protocols would be within the high school.

589
01:52:03,181 --> 01:52:19,333
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the most important part was to make sure that students in small group tours could find their classes, because knowing that they were coming into the school the next day, we wanted to give them an idea of, you know, where to go, because they would have walked into the building without having any knowledge whatsoever.

590
01:52:21,685 --> 01:52:24,927
[SPEAKER_01]: That day prior to orientation, we mailed home schedules.

591
01:52:24,987 --> 01:52:29,549
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at the little arrow there, it also noted their cohorts.

592
01:52:29,869 --> 01:52:31,930
[SPEAKER_01]: This was also posted on their school brains.

593
01:52:32,471 --> 01:52:35,712
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to make sure that everyone had an updated schedule with room numbers.

594
01:52:36,553 --> 01:52:41,635
[SPEAKER_01]: Prior to when we had posted out schedules, we didn't put room numbers because we were all remote.

595
01:52:42,316 --> 01:52:50,620
[SPEAKER_01]: So we mailed these out physically, but we also made sure we sent out messages of where to locate that in their school brains portal.

596
01:52:52,680 --> 01:52:55,541
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you can see here, and if you look carefully, you see Ms.

597
01:52:55,581 --> 01:52:58,602
[SPEAKER_01]: Walker doing our presentation to our ninth graders.

598
01:52:59,702 --> 01:53:02,443
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, this was one of the groups of the four groups that were there.

599
01:53:02,483 --> 01:53:04,984
[SPEAKER_01]: We also had staff members that volunteered their time.

600
01:53:06,044 --> 01:53:14,867
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, you know, very good that we had people that could answer questions for our freshmen as they were going through their tours and making sure everybody was social distance as we were

601
01:53:15,588 --> 01:53:16,711
[SPEAKER_01]: walking through the building.

602
01:53:16,731 --> 01:53:24,228
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, a highly successful rate of having students come into small groups at four times during the day.

603
01:53:25,890 --> 01:53:28,171
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also wanted to make sure that they left with a map.

604
01:53:29,372 --> 01:53:35,535
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our Mustang map that was basically given to every student.

605
01:53:35,615 --> 01:53:38,076
[SPEAKER_01]: It was developed by the CCSR when I first came here.

606
01:53:38,116 --> 01:53:39,277
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the better maps.

607
01:53:40,358 --> 01:53:47,901
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple of editing parts that needed there, but it was enough that we made sure that every student knew which area of the building was what.

608
01:53:49,983 --> 01:53:54,465
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these are the topics that we covered at both the family forums and the freshman orientation.

609
01:53:55,717 --> 01:54:02,830
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing was important to know exactly who is what cohort, understanding that cohort A comes four days a week.

610
01:54:03,471 --> 01:54:06,536
[SPEAKER_01]: Cohort B was based off of an alpha split from A through K.

611
01:54:08,014 --> 01:54:14,601
[SPEAKER_01]: cohort C, again, last name L through Z. Wednesday, everybody was remote, and cohort D, students were remote every day.

612
01:54:15,802 --> 01:54:21,648
[SPEAKER_01]: With this slide itself, I wanted to make sure that people also understand that our cohorts are still fluid.

613
01:54:22,529 --> 01:54:30,536
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some certain circumstances, so even though it says alpha split, there are some circumstances that families have contacted assistant principals and myself

614
01:54:32,018 --> 01:54:32,979
[SPEAKER_01]: of making a switch.

615
01:54:33,379 --> 01:54:36,361
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it happens to be a sibling preference.

616
01:54:37,222 --> 01:54:45,149
[SPEAKER_01]: So even though your alpha split is A through K, you know, you might have a sibling preference or someone with a different last name that needs to be aligned.

617
01:54:45,209 --> 01:54:48,332
[SPEAKER_01]: So we move those students over to what's beneficial to families.

618
01:54:50,777 --> 01:54:53,039
[SPEAKER_01]: A reminder of everyone of how we started.

619
01:54:53,059 --> 01:54:57,282
[SPEAKER_01]: So cohorts C started that Thursday, Friday on the 14th and the 15th.

620
01:54:57,342 --> 01:55:03,386
[SPEAKER_01]: Cohort B, unfortunately, not unfortunately, but because due to the holiday, they had to start on Tuesday, 1-19.

621
01:55:04,107 --> 01:55:08,510
[SPEAKER_01]: And that we were having alternate weeks for CTE week for shops.

622
01:55:08,670 --> 01:55:12,493
[SPEAKER_01]: So we wanted to make sure that that was listed as well for every student.

623
01:55:15,647 --> 01:55:34,312
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to make sure people had an idea of who's who in the building I know they they virtually saw us but wanted to make sure that they knew who I was who Mr. Fallon was who their assistant principals are so they had support within the building and to kind of put a face to a name, especially in for freshman orientation everybody was present.

624
01:55:35,272 --> 01:55:41,738
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's good for them to see who we are so they could definitely know who to go to for assistance and what we look like.

625
01:55:42,218 --> 01:55:49,284
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though we're unmasked in these pictures, at least our profiles were able to be shown as best we could.

626
01:55:51,302 --> 01:55:57,107
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, one another thing we brought up was technology for in person learning and matter of fact if you look there.

627
01:55:57,807 --> 01:56:02,992
[SPEAKER_01]: The highlighted part or the bolded part is having school issue Chromebooks, especially with our Wi Fi.

628
01:56:03,832 --> 01:56:05,574
[SPEAKER_01]: We're noting that students that are bringing in.

629
01:56:07,275 --> 01:56:15,877
[SPEAKER_01]: devices that are their own or having difficulty connecting to the Wi-Fi, even though we have areas of remote, it doesn't really matter where the area is.

630
01:56:15,937 --> 01:56:17,458
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not really a signal problem.

631
01:56:17,498 --> 01:56:24,940
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more of that home device has a difficulty connecting to the school network or puts you on a limited device.

632
01:56:25,540 --> 01:56:32,382
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're on a Zoom, it kind of gets kind of difficult to stay connected or you're going to kind of constantly have to reconnect as well.

633
01:56:33,452 --> 01:56:38,214
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're working on definitely making sure that our school-issued Chromebooks are getting out to all our students.

634
01:56:38,994 --> 01:56:42,496
[SPEAKER_01]: We're using our library as well as a way of getting that need.

635
01:56:43,316 --> 01:56:47,118
[SPEAKER_01]: Contacting is a point way of making sure that you can get a device.

636
01:56:48,118 --> 01:56:50,159
[SPEAKER_01]: We tell all our students to bring their chargers.

637
01:56:50,239 --> 01:56:55,141
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though we don't have a lot of charging stations, we are trying to find areas within the building.

638
01:56:56,182 --> 01:57:01,224
[SPEAKER_01]: Chad Fallon and the electrical crew have been working on doing some charging stations in the cafeteria.

639
01:57:02,193 --> 01:57:03,033
[SPEAKER_01]: for during lunch.

640
01:57:04,134 --> 01:57:06,735
[SPEAKER_01]: We do know that Zoom tends to take a lot of juice out.

641
01:57:06,835 --> 01:57:11,076
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully, you know, most people get it done, but it is able to get done.

642
01:57:11,116 --> 01:57:16,838
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of our statements that we do preach all the time is to make sure your device is charged overnight.

643
01:57:16,958 --> 01:57:19,659
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're bringing it in fully charged.

644
01:57:22,304 --> 01:57:40,922
[SPEAKER_01]: Regarding building info, as we know we have no lockers if you were to walk in the building we've actually zip tied them shut with with not to make sure that, you know, these are areas where we're not leaving materials that could possibly potentially spread are the sorry the virus.

645
01:57:42,143 --> 01:57:46,525
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do ask to not bring extra items outside of basically what you need for your class.

646
01:57:46,565 --> 01:57:49,366
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we do know that book bags can get kind of heavy.

647
01:57:50,046 --> 01:57:52,246
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to make sure that you're bringing your essentials.

648
01:57:52,987 --> 01:57:54,507
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have no water bubblers.

649
01:57:54,567 --> 01:57:56,188
[SPEAKER_01]: If you walk around, they're all taped off.

650
01:57:56,688 --> 01:57:59,809
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are encouraging everyone to bring a big bottle of water if needed.

651
01:58:00,489 --> 01:58:01,990
[SPEAKER_01]: Our bathroom signs are listed.

652
01:58:02,790 --> 01:58:05,611
[SPEAKER_01]: Most bathrooms are one person at a time, although in the science area,

653
01:58:06,212 --> 01:58:09,599
[SPEAKER_01]: We are allowing two people at a time as that room is cleared.

654
01:58:09,619 --> 01:58:13,608
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're trying to stress not to remove your mask while you're in the bathroom.

655
01:58:15,015 --> 01:58:20,037
[SPEAKER_01]: We discussed a little bit regarding the MBTA, again, because that is the main source of transportation.

656
01:58:20,737 --> 01:58:31,220
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that we've noted is that we're sort of bound by MBTA, just being that we utilize their service to drop students off and take students home through the high school.

657
01:58:31,260 --> 01:58:36,942
[SPEAKER_01]: And the MBTA has their own set of rules regarding pickups and how many people they're going to put on a bus.

658
01:58:37,802 --> 01:58:42,845
[SPEAKER_01]: We have noted that if students are going to be tardy and it's due to a bus, that's no fault of theirs.

659
01:58:42,905 --> 01:58:53,491
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to make sure that they're checking in with their assistant principal when they come into the building so that we can make sure we adjust and notify staff that the reason why students might be late.

660
01:58:53,511 --> 01:58:54,792
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, no fault of their own.

661
01:58:55,332 --> 01:58:57,193
[SPEAKER_01]: We are going to do our monthly bus passes.

662
01:58:57,273 --> 01:59:03,396
[SPEAKER_01]: As a matter of fact, in February, the first week of February, that whole week, we'll be offering bus passes to be purchased.

663
01:59:04,357 --> 01:59:06,478
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be in the foyer.

664
01:59:07,133 --> 01:59:19,056
[SPEAKER_01]: The main foyer where between the EL department area and the library, just right outside there, that's where the students are going to be able to purchase their monthly bus passes.

665
01:59:20,181 --> 01:59:23,004
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have students that are coming to school driving.

666
01:59:23,064 --> 01:59:29,310
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we ask that students please register their cars like we've done in the past.

667
01:59:30,131 --> 01:59:32,533
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we can use this for tracing in certain things.

668
01:59:33,114 --> 01:59:35,856
[SPEAKER_01]: We also want people to also stay COVID safe.

669
01:59:36,537 --> 01:59:37,378
[SPEAKER_01]: Riders should be masked.

670
01:59:37,418 --> 01:59:38,118
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's hard.

671
01:59:38,339 --> 01:59:39,580
[SPEAKER_01]: I know people want to carpool.

672
01:59:40,080 --> 01:59:42,323
[SPEAKER_01]: We're kind of encouraging not to have that.

673
01:59:42,903 --> 01:59:52,054
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you are carpooling, you're following the rules within what the governor set down that everyone's wearing a mask within the car as they're coming to school.

674
01:59:55,041 --> 02:00:01,484
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to note some building entrances and actually that's a picture of our floors if you notice the one way stickers in the morning.

675
02:00:02,165 --> 02:00:04,386
[SPEAKER_01]: Our main high school entrance which is in the foyer.

676
02:00:05,126 --> 02:00:09,448
[SPEAKER_01]: The vocational main entrance, which utilizes specialized transportation as well.

677
02:00:09,928 --> 02:00:13,250
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've opened up our West courtyard library doors normally we used to have.

678
02:00:14,525 --> 02:00:16,468
[SPEAKER_01]: Students walk in into door 17.

679
02:00:16,708 --> 02:00:19,592
[SPEAKER_01]: This time what we're doing is we're opening up all the library doors.

680
02:00:20,193 --> 02:00:23,937
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's free access and less touching of a door coming in.

681
02:00:24,638 --> 02:00:27,102
[SPEAKER_01]: There's hand sanitizers at each area.

682
02:00:28,267 --> 02:00:33,952
[SPEAKER_01]: And then students can head to their breakfast and they can head to the areas where they're close to first period.

683
02:00:34,673 --> 02:00:38,877
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, always making sure that we're keeping social distancing, we're not trying to crowd.

684
02:00:40,198 --> 02:00:44,042
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, their hand sanitizers, hand washing areas within each class.

685
02:00:44,863 --> 02:00:48,346
[SPEAKER_01]: And we ask that we do that before and after when it comes to breakfast or lunch.

686
02:00:49,942 --> 02:00:56,425
[SPEAKER_01]: As stated, we still have a free breakfast and lunch for all students, which is completely awesome, I would say, for this year.

687
02:00:56,445 --> 02:01:00,887
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if there's some good things that happen with COVID, we're ensuring that everyone is getting fed.

688
02:01:02,108 --> 02:01:05,269
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do have a 7 to 740 breakfast program.

689
02:01:05,829 --> 02:01:14,774
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason why it's that early, I mean, we try to limit time as best we can, but we also know that the MBTA buses tend to drop students off a little bit earlier than usual.

690
02:01:15,954 --> 02:01:21,057
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to make sure that students can definitely get their food and maintain their social distance.

691
02:01:21,717 --> 02:01:23,978
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, lunch is from 10.50 to 11.20.

692
02:01:24,619 --> 02:01:34,103
[SPEAKER_01]: The way that we have that utilized, there are multiple locations where students can eat, but our pickup stations are mostly in cafeteria three and cafeteria two.

693
02:01:34,724 --> 02:01:41,027
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been stating every day and making announcements that if you are going to eat in cafeteria two and cafeteria one,

694
02:01:41,847 --> 02:01:54,178
[SPEAKER_01]: you're to pick up your food in CAF 2, and if you're gonna eat in CAF 3, and we also have our bleachers labeled in the gymnasium, that you would pick up your lunch in CAF 3 so that we don't have a bottleneck.

695
02:01:54,858 --> 02:02:04,207
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the things that we also realized on the first day regarding making sure everybody was safe, and I think the multiple areas definitely helped out within the next days.

696
02:02:06,557 --> 02:02:08,699
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just a basic daily schedule of the day.

697
02:02:08,719 --> 02:02:12,581
[SPEAKER_01]: If you notice the first bell is at 740 as it normally is.

698
02:02:13,081 --> 02:02:17,084
[SPEAKER_01]: What's different here is that we're asking students to report to their period one class.

699
02:02:18,025 --> 02:02:22,047
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where they will hear their announcements and that's where they'll take attendance.

700
02:02:22,228 --> 02:02:27,851
[SPEAKER_01]: And we take attendance by period so that we can determine who's present

701
02:02:29,132 --> 02:02:40,336
[SPEAKER_01]: in the building physically, who's present remote in their class, because there are students that are accessing the same class remotely, absent in the building, and absent remotely as well.

702
02:02:41,156 --> 02:02:48,439
[SPEAKER_01]: We do this for every period, and then at the end of the day, we compile that attendance to make the determination for the daily attendance.

703
02:02:53,526 --> 02:02:55,907
[SPEAKER_01]: We ask for classroom assignments and remote teachers.

704
02:02:55,967 --> 02:02:59,509
[SPEAKER_01]: So we ask for people to look in their schedule for room assignments.

705
02:03:00,229 --> 02:03:04,872
[SPEAKER_01]: We do daily notices for any room changes that might happen throughout the days.

706
02:03:06,153 --> 02:03:13,857
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, we might have a student, not a student, excuse me, a teacher that is sick, not due to COVID, but might be taking a sick day.

707
02:03:13,877 --> 02:03:19,420
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to make sure that there's an area within the remote, reverse remote for those students to go.

708
02:03:19,460 --> 02:03:20,321
[SPEAKER_01]: So we notify them.

709
02:03:21,061 --> 02:03:24,102
[SPEAKER_01]: during that area, and we assign them to separate spaces.

710
02:03:24,703 --> 02:03:27,984
[SPEAKER_01]: As of right now, what we've been doing is we've been utilizing the CAF3.

711
02:03:28,544 --> 02:03:37,148
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been utilizing Lecture Hall 3 and currently Lecture Hall 2 to make sure that everyone is maintained social distance while connecting remotely.

712
02:03:37,629 --> 02:03:41,310
[SPEAKER_01]: The one thing I will definitely say that's important is the headphones.

713
02:03:41,790 --> 02:03:44,672
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gotten a few emails regarding things being louder

714
02:03:45,913 --> 02:03:48,297
[SPEAKER_01]: The headphones are going to be key as best we can.

715
02:03:48,357 --> 02:03:59,093
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that it's not easy to access remotely a teacher while you're in the building, but having those headphones do the noise reduction as best as possible.

716
02:04:01,592 --> 02:04:05,956
[SPEAKER_01]: Dismissal, again, we try to make sure that we're doing a six feet.

717
02:04:06,717 --> 02:04:10,720
[SPEAKER_01]: We try to tell students to use a door that they are closest with.

718
02:04:10,900 --> 02:04:12,902
[SPEAKER_01]: I know sometimes that takes a little bit around.

719
02:04:13,443 --> 02:04:23,612
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, if you're in the C2 area and you're closest to the cafeteria, you would want to exit through the community schools exit.

720
02:04:24,212 --> 02:04:27,875
[SPEAKER_01]: Some students that are close to the C area, they exit through the library doors.

721
02:04:29,497 --> 02:04:32,519
[SPEAKER_01]: Some students exit through the front foyer or the vocational area.

722
02:04:32,539 --> 02:04:39,204
[SPEAKER_01]: We try to keep things as open as possible so that people are spread out and can go to their areas for dismissal.

723
02:04:41,726 --> 02:04:44,408
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing we definitely wanted to note is our guidance team.

724
02:04:44,889 --> 02:04:50,153
[SPEAKER_01]: Our guidance team has definitely been helpful with schedules and definitely guidance through the building as well.

725
02:04:50,193 --> 02:04:55,817
[SPEAKER_01]: So guiding our students in certain areas, even supporting of having difficult times,

726
02:04:56,718 --> 02:05:04,521
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to make sure that, again, that everyone had a face to the name, because, again, being remote and then being in the building, there's been discussions.

727
02:05:05,101 --> 02:05:06,702
[SPEAKER_01]: There's definitely been people connecting.

728
02:05:07,042 --> 02:05:14,804
[SPEAKER_01]: But having a physical conversation or knowing who that person is was important for us to make sure we noted throughout our presentations.

729
02:05:16,645 --> 02:05:24,048
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that we definitely asked in our presentations in freshman orientation, we asked that people contacted their assistant principal.

730
02:05:25,243 --> 02:05:26,484
[SPEAKER_01]: if they weren't feeling well.

731
02:05:26,524 --> 02:05:32,148
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, if a student wasn't feeling well and they woke up, we ask that we contact the assistant principal.

732
02:05:32,168 --> 02:05:40,674
[SPEAKER_01]: We know we wanna contact the nurses as well, but for us to be notified so that we know exactly who's staying home, is it going to be remote?

733
02:05:42,195 --> 02:05:46,358
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, as Mr. Murphy said, our cohorts are sort of fluid right now.

734
02:05:47,238 --> 02:05:52,022
[SPEAKER_01]: Some students are opting to continue to be in cohort D even though they were intended to be in cohort C.

735
02:05:52,762 --> 02:05:57,746
[SPEAKER_01]: So those conversations with your assistant principal help us kind of isolate the numbers that we need.

736
02:05:57,826 --> 02:06:01,548
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we want to make sure that everyone's getting the learning experience that they want.

737
02:06:02,269 --> 02:06:08,693
[SPEAKER_01]: So your assistant principal basically is very key in order for that and the assistant principal and the nurse will be in contact as well.

738
02:06:10,765 --> 02:06:21,277
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to make sure everyone was noting our nursing staff who have been phenomenal throughout this year, especially with the COVID testing, as well as doing their due days and their contact tracing.

739
02:06:21,898 --> 02:06:24,420
[SPEAKER_01]: So people understood who they were and what they've done.

740
02:06:24,440 --> 02:06:27,144
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely gone above and beyond this year.

741
02:06:27,184 --> 02:06:31,869
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very appreciative and noted from the high school administration.

742
02:06:33,875 --> 02:06:46,643
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, if you go through the high school and if you notice too, we have our little TV set that's right at the foyer and our LED lights, we are stressing our school protocols regarding what we should be doing throughout the day.

743
02:06:47,463 --> 02:06:53,447
[SPEAKER_01]: The independence of high school can be very challenging sometimes, especially when moving from class to class.

744
02:06:54,207 --> 02:06:59,851
[SPEAKER_01]: Our administration has basically been outside, you know, reminding students to say, you know, arms length apart,

745
02:07:00,631 --> 02:07:02,392
[SPEAKER_01]: is six feet as best as possible.

746
02:07:03,292 --> 02:07:07,695
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very hard though, socially, I can understand that, but it's something that we work on and we preach.

747
02:07:07,715 --> 02:07:11,777
[SPEAKER_01]: So we always are constantly doing these reminders, especially in the morning announcements.

748
02:07:13,652 --> 02:07:19,534
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was cute that just to show exactly what a mask could be as you're going through the day.

749
02:07:20,354 --> 02:07:23,995
[SPEAKER_01]: We also wanted to note that our rooms are disinfected every day.

750
02:07:24,896 --> 02:07:31,618
[SPEAKER_01]: Each room is supplied with hand sanitizer and disinfectant spray, paper towels, disposable masks.

751
02:07:32,762 --> 02:07:45,401
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a protocol that we've been using is, again, teacher will spray the desk, student will grab a paper towel and wipe down the desk, the paper towel is thrown into the barrel, and then students will use hand sanitizer after the class is completed.

752
02:07:46,782 --> 02:07:53,670
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually at the end of this as well I always say thanks for everyone's patience and support if everyone understands or any messages you've gotten from me.

753
02:07:54,171 --> 02:08:03,221
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always asked for forgiveness and flexibility as this is new for everybody, but I have to admit, it's been wonderful having students in the building.

754
02:08:03,341 --> 02:08:03,842
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been great.

755
02:08:05,083 --> 02:08:07,546
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing them throughout the day and saying hello to them.

756
02:08:08,587 --> 02:08:14,473
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, being in the building when we were in a sort of a bear state really made it very difficult.

757
02:08:14,493 --> 02:08:26,726
[SPEAKER_01]: The school is really having people in person and with the push of the central administration and again the building admin team and I also want to thank the teachers as we had good dialogue back and forth

758
02:08:27,507 --> 02:08:31,649
[SPEAKER_01]: regarding what works, what doesn't work so that we can make it work.

759
02:08:32,590 --> 02:08:35,492
[SPEAKER_01]: It all couldn't have been done unless everybody was involved.

760
02:08:35,532 --> 02:08:39,594
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you everyone and I'm happy to answer any questions that you may have.

761
02:08:40,935 --> 02:08:46,418
[SPEAKER_02]: I also just wanted to say that Principal Chad Fallon is also on the line and I didn't know if

762
02:08:47,364 --> 02:08:59,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Principal Fallon, you wanted to just say something specifically regarding activities that's happening in the vocational world to make sure that everyone can hear what was happening on that as well.

763
02:09:01,770 --> 02:09:02,050
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

764
02:09:02,110 --> 02:09:02,511
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

765
02:09:02,791 --> 02:09:03,692
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy New Year, everybody.

766
02:09:04,533 --> 02:09:06,115
[SPEAKER_09]: All 15 of our programs are open.

767
02:09:06,135 --> 02:09:10,300
[SPEAKER_09]: The presentation that Paul shared with you was the same presentation we used at our parent forum.

768
02:09:11,361 --> 02:09:13,183
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're all following the same protocol.

769
02:09:13,644 --> 02:09:17,829
[SPEAKER_09]: We have our health assisting students are still at Lawrence Memorial Hospital because of that.

770
02:09:19,350 --> 02:09:21,791
[SPEAKER_09]: onsite experience has been good, so they're still enjoying that.

771
02:09:22,351 --> 02:09:28,192
[SPEAKER_09]: Our electricians and laborers are out at our Habitat site in Andover, and a salon will be opening within the next few weeks.

772
02:09:28,232 --> 02:09:29,252
[SPEAKER_09]: We're moving up this week.

773
02:09:30,333 --> 02:09:31,213
[SPEAKER_09]: Teachers are doing great.

774
02:09:31,233 --> 02:09:33,853
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, the blended instruction is working.

775
02:09:34,114 --> 02:09:37,814
[SPEAKER_09]: It's tough to be teaching students in person and virtually, but they're doing it.

776
02:09:37,834 --> 02:09:38,955
[SPEAKER_09]: They're doing an amazing job.

777
02:09:39,735 --> 02:09:41,975
[SPEAKER_09]: We're working on a few glitches, but we're getting through it.

778
02:09:42,295 --> 02:09:42,996
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone's okay.

779
02:09:43,276 --> 02:09:48,117
[SPEAKER_09]: We have pushed up the Freshman Exploratory Program so that everyone's going to be in their final placement by

780
02:09:49,277 --> 02:09:58,767
[SPEAKER_09]: February 4th, so that everyone has some ample time to actually be in person in their CDE program if they are choosing an in-person model.

781
02:09:59,667 --> 02:10:01,790
[SPEAKER_09]: Anybody has any questions, I'm here on the call if you need me.

782
02:10:01,950 --> 02:10:02,610
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice to see you all.

783
02:10:07,755 --> 02:10:08,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Fallon.

784
02:10:08,896 --> 02:10:10,458
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. DeLeva.

785
02:10:12,220 --> 02:10:13,441
[SPEAKER_06]: Very thorough presentation.

786
02:10:14,662 --> 02:10:23,366
[SPEAKER_06]: Number four, we have report on Tufts University free course offering for high school student, Dr. Peter Cushing and principal Paul DeLava.

787
02:10:24,327 --> 02:10:26,188
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening, Madam Mayor and members of the school committee.

788
02:10:26,208 --> 02:10:34,592
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for the opportunity to present this tremendous opportunity that Tufts University is providing to some of our students and some students at Somerville High School as well.

789
02:10:35,392 --> 02:10:41,535
[SPEAKER_13]: In December of 2020, the director of the Tufts University Office of Government and Community Relations

790
02:10:42,173 --> 02:10:54,461
[SPEAKER_13]: Rocco DiRico contacted Medford Public Schools and offered two of our students to take classes at the university free of charge.

791
02:10:55,281 --> 02:11:06,508
[SPEAKER_13]: It provides the students that have financial need the ability to take this course for college credit while providing them also a prestigious opportunity on their application.

792
02:11:06,729 --> 02:11:10,451
[SPEAKER_13]: There are a couple of qualifications that they would like us to adhere to first.

793
02:11:10,928 --> 02:11:25,040
[SPEAKER_13]: Students should be a junior or senior in good academic standing as deemed by the school, demonstrate academic ability and maturity to participate in college-level work, and with the necessary proficiency in English as determined by the principal or the designee.

794
02:11:25,701 --> 02:11:32,787
[SPEAKER_13]: A high school transcript needs to be provided, demonstrate their interest in taking a class at Tufts in the form of a letter or an essay,

795
02:11:33,673 --> 02:11:44,682
[SPEAKER_13]: And it should indicate at least one class the student has an interest in taking so they'd need to review their, the Tufts University transcript and then also to demonstrate a financial need for the scholarship.

796
02:11:45,803 --> 02:11:51,227
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd like to turn it over now to Principal DeLava to talk about the students selected for this opportunity.

797
02:11:52,972 --> 02:11:54,274
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you and hello again.

798
02:11:54,294 --> 02:12:09,034
[SPEAKER_01]: I just to reiterate to what Dr. Cushman said, obviously, within our school system we also had to generate interest that had occurred, and students had the ability to write their essays.

799
02:12:09,655 --> 02:12:12,416
[SPEAKER_01]: and present them, we had them present them to their assistant principals.

800
02:12:13,036 --> 02:12:17,176
[SPEAKER_01]: So our junior and senior assistant principals are Ms.

801
02:12:17,276 --> 02:12:29,179
[SPEAKER_01]: Alice Beth Fitzpatrick on the vocational side, as well as Mr. Blauch on the high school side, and that's for 11th and 12th grade, as we did some restructuring this year to make sure every student was covered.

802
02:12:29,899 --> 02:12:35,260
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were able to review the essays, and then basically the finalists were brought forth to me.

803
02:12:36,347 --> 02:12:51,836
[SPEAKER_01]: And then using the guidelines that Dr. Cushion had stated from the Tufts perspective, we were able to present our student, which I'm happy to tell you her name is Liza Lopes, who was actually at with Dr. Vincent this Monday.

804
02:12:51,956 --> 02:12:54,538
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a CCSR student.

805
02:12:55,158 --> 02:13:03,401
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a student that is definitely in a good academic standing and we wanted to make sure that she had this opportunity to take the course at Tufts.

806
02:13:03,841 --> 02:13:13,305
[SPEAKER_01]: The one thing about her essay, which is actually wonderful, is that due to some financial and lack of interest, there was a course actually that we ended up having to not run.

807
02:13:14,065 --> 02:13:26,131
[SPEAKER_01]: This year, which was economics, believe it or not, and Liza had stated in her essay that that was the course that she wants to take at Tufts so I was very, very, very happy that that that's something that she's able to do.

808
02:13:27,351 --> 02:13:30,013
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's ready to start in the spring semester.

809
02:13:31,059 --> 02:13:43,764
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, this all happened so fast prior to the break, but I'm very happy that we were able to definitely determine our student for the spring semester, and she's very excited to get going.

810
02:13:44,005 --> 02:13:49,067
[SPEAKER_01]: So congratulations, Liza, and wanted it to be noted by the school committee.

811
02:13:49,087 --> 02:13:49,527
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.

812
02:13:54,289 --> 02:13:55,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Van de Kloot.

813
02:13:55,770 --> 02:13:56,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

814
02:13:56,771 --> 02:14:01,594
[SPEAKER_03]: First, I want to thank you, Mr. DeLiva, for your presentation and Mr. Fallon.

815
02:14:02,554 --> 02:14:07,978
[SPEAKER_03]: In regards specifically to the Tufts, were there quite a number of students who were interested?

816
02:14:10,196 --> 02:14:13,537
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't say that there was a lot.

817
02:14:14,677 --> 02:14:21,779
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, I don't wanna say due to COVID, but I think it's kind of the same, do I wanna take on something more?

818
02:14:21,799 --> 02:14:38,362
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if the issue, I can't figure out exactly what the issue is, but I could say just on the general feel when we put it out there, I think there are some students that are just focused on their academia at the high school and taking an extra step wasn't something that they were interested at this time.

819
02:14:38,542 --> 02:14:49,549
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing I wondered is if there was a second student who was particularly interested, and I don't know whether that's the case, but whether we could go back to Tufts and say, hey, we've got another student who's really interested.

820
02:14:50,389 --> 02:15:04,158
[SPEAKER_03]: And if that were being, I'm all hypothetical here, but if there was any thought that there was another student who was a close call, I would certainly encourage you to say, could we go back and ask?

821
02:15:05,058 --> 02:15:11,843
[SPEAKER_03]: because there is a certain flexibility too with perhaps making a class of another extra student.

822
02:15:12,223 --> 02:15:13,764
[SPEAKER_03]: I see Dr. Cushing has his hand up.

823
02:15:14,205 --> 02:15:14,485
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

824
02:15:14,665 --> 02:15:16,206
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have probably said this as well.

825
02:15:16,826 --> 02:15:20,509
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have a summer course as well that Tufts is offering.

826
02:15:20,988 --> 02:15:21,488
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's great.

827
02:15:21,508 --> 02:15:36,371
[SPEAKER_01]: So within that piece of what you're stating, that's sort of the logic that we're heading towards as well, towards the summer course, which then alleviates that, you know, I want to focus on my academia at Medford High School, you now have a little bit more time as well.

828
02:15:36,391 --> 02:15:42,452
[SPEAKER_01]: So using that and reopening up the application process, I think is something that we're going to end up doing for the summer.

829
02:15:42,532 --> 02:15:43,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's great.

830
02:15:43,732 --> 02:15:45,372
[SPEAKER_03]: One can only always want more though.

831
02:15:45,732 --> 02:15:46,752
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you very much.

832
02:15:47,753 --> 02:15:48,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

833
02:15:48,073 --> 02:15:48,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Cushing?

834
02:15:51,118 --> 02:16:03,990
[SPEAKER_13]: So this program came about, I mean, this is a phenomenal opportunity by Tufts and really we cannot say enough about our Tufts University partners and how well they support the Metro Public Schools in so many ways.

835
02:16:04,891 --> 02:16:09,255
[SPEAKER_13]: There was a rather short run up to this first

836
02:16:09,829 --> 02:16:10,889
[SPEAKER_13]: course being offered.

837
02:16:11,510 --> 02:16:21,794
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think also that tight timeline might have limited students, their ability to write an essay, their ability to really get something in, that might've been a hindrance.

838
02:16:21,994 --> 02:16:26,416
[SPEAKER_13]: I think moving forward, we'll have a fiercely competitive process.

839
02:16:26,536 --> 02:16:35,680
[SPEAKER_13]: Not that this wasn't, but I think we will have a fiercely robust process to make sure this happens and is well-publicized.

840
02:16:35,760 --> 02:16:39,262
[SPEAKER_13]: We had a very tight window moving in this first step.

841
02:16:41,173 --> 02:16:45,578
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to also state that I was really appreciative of this great opportunity that came.

842
02:16:46,462 --> 02:17:14,185
[SPEAKER_02]: The timeframe was very, very tight, but I was just grateful that we were able to get this great opportunity out to one of our students and that a student who shows that they have, you know, a strong desire to be pushed and to be able to, provided they do well with the coursework, they'll be able to apply it to their college transcripts or, you know, have one extra elective class that they can take.

843
02:17:14,785 --> 02:17:17,406
[SPEAKER_02]: So that'll be a savings to a family as well.

844
02:17:17,506 --> 02:17:21,308
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just wanted to thank Tufts for that.

845
02:17:21,588 --> 02:17:23,909
[SPEAKER_02]: And I agree with you, Member Vander Kloot.

846
02:17:24,810 --> 02:17:26,891
[SPEAKER_02]: We can always try to see if we can squeeze in.

847
02:17:26,911 --> 02:17:31,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Start with one, go to two and get up to three or up to five students.

848
02:17:32,313 --> 02:17:34,914
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be wonderful for our students.

849
02:17:36,875 --> 02:17:37,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

850
02:17:37,375 --> 02:17:38,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. DeLava?

851
02:17:39,398 --> 02:17:48,281
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to piggyback too, I think what's unique about this program too is it's students in need as well.

852
02:17:49,282 --> 02:18:01,827
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not trying to say one is better than the other, but that is a criteria, not by us, but by Tufts is looking to give opportunities for students that normally wouldn't have this kind of opportunity as well.

853
02:18:01,887 --> 02:18:04,428
[SPEAKER_01]: So just the fact that we're,

854
02:18:05,277 --> 02:18:12,140
[SPEAKER_01]: we're looking at all aspects of a student and making sure that they're getting the best that they possibly can get.

855
02:18:12,160 --> 02:18:17,582
[SPEAKER_01]: That was really something that Mr. DeRico had definitely, that rang home when he met with us.

856
02:18:17,762 --> 02:18:22,784
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to make sure that that's how the process is basically working as well.

857
02:18:24,345 --> 02:18:25,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Great, thank you so much.

858
02:18:26,486 --> 02:18:27,746
[SPEAKER_06]: And thank you to Tufts University.

859
02:18:30,360 --> 02:18:38,145
[SPEAKER_06]: five recommendation to approve revised job description for re-engagement specialists, Dr. Maurice Edward Vincent and Mr. David Murphy.

860
02:18:39,986 --> 02:18:58,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, so we're really excited this evening to talk to you about this re-envisioned position of a re-engagement specialist and through much discussion and really thinking about taking something that in the past may have

861
02:18:59,345 --> 02:19:18,485
[SPEAKER_02]: had a more negative connotation and changing it so that it's a proactive connotation and really saying we would like this person to be a re-engagement specialist, helping us re-engage with students that may

862
02:19:20,107 --> 02:19:38,260
[SPEAKER_02]: for whatever reason, life challenges, or maybe on the path to wanting to drop out of school to think twice and be able to have a specialist, a liaison, be able to help us close that gap and keep all of our students in school and on task.

863
02:19:38,800 --> 02:19:49,588
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to just pass it on to my colleague, Mr. Murphy, and let him give a little bit more context about this re-engagement specialist.

864
02:19:50,912 --> 02:20:00,754
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure, so I'll just expand briefly upon what the superintendent said, and certainly would look forward to answering any questions as I would other, I know other members of the team will as well.

865
02:20:01,794 --> 02:20:09,975
[SPEAKER_12]: The district, as all districts are, is obligated to employ an individual who serves as a supervisor of student attendance.

866
02:20:10,635 --> 02:20:15,276
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a position that in past iterations would be referred to as a truancy officer.

867
02:20:15,896 --> 02:20:19,117
[SPEAKER_12]: As the superintendent stated, it was the leadership team's view

868
02:20:19,931 --> 02:20:48,306
[SPEAKER_12]: and certainly our perspective that many in the community felt similar, that we want this position to move away from the type of punitive perspective in which students should be punished for failing to comply with the rules and regulations of school and move toward a more affirming perspective in which we recognize that when students become disengaged from school,

869
02:20:48,870 --> 02:20:51,652
[SPEAKER_12]: It is often due to circumstances that are beyond their control.

870
02:20:52,013 --> 02:21:13,469
[SPEAKER_12]: And it is always under conditions that we as district and school leaders need to take into account and try to bring students and families back into school communities and making sure that they are well situated where they can be successful as students and ultimately as graduates.

871
02:21:13,669 --> 02:21:18,353
[SPEAKER_12]: So the modifications to the posting that

872
02:21:19,135 --> 02:21:26,479
[SPEAKER_12]: has been up on the district's job postings for some time, frankly, predating my arrivals.

873
02:21:26,959 --> 02:21:48,050
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't exactly know when this vacancy occurred, but it's something that we put a lot of thought into over the last several months, received a lot of feedback, and we feel as though the position as described in the job description that has been proposed to you will hopefully attract a candidate pool, although we will certainly

874
02:21:48,412 --> 02:21:58,338
[SPEAKER_12]: review the candidates that have applied under the old job description as well that are consistent with the priorities, principles, and values that are embodied in the proposed job description.

875
02:21:58,418 --> 02:22:01,459
[SPEAKER_12]: So again, happy to answer any questions about it.

876
02:22:01,479 --> 02:22:06,882
[SPEAKER_12]: There is some ambiguity, frankly, in the description as to whether this would be a part-time or full-time role.

877
02:22:07,543 --> 02:22:09,584
[SPEAKER_12]: In most districts, this is a part-time role.

878
02:22:10,765 --> 02:22:16,768
[SPEAKER_12]: We are open, sort of open-minded about that and want to see what the candidate pool and what the budgetary capacity is.

879
02:22:17,265 --> 02:22:20,447
[SPEAKER_12]: before making a determination as to whether this would be part-time or full-time.

880
02:22:21,647 --> 02:22:28,911
[SPEAKER_12]: Obviously, that determination will affect the core functions, or at least the overall job duties to some extent.

881
02:22:29,311 --> 02:22:35,674
[SPEAKER_12]: But the core functions and the role in the organization would be similar, frankly, whether it's a full-time or part-time.

882
02:22:35,694 --> 02:22:43,598
[SPEAKER_12]: It would just be an expanded portfolio in supporting school leaders and other administrators and teachers in reengaging students, if it were to be full-time.

883
02:22:43,618 --> 02:22:46,120
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're going to sort of defer on that one.

884
02:22:47,438 --> 02:22:56,966
[SPEAKER_12]: with your indulgence and then just with regard to putting the posting up and making sure that we're advertising the position correctly though, that is why we would seek the committee's endorsement tonight.

885
02:23:01,170 --> 02:23:01,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Russo.

886
02:23:03,392 --> 02:23:03,793
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

887
02:23:04,253 --> 02:23:13,201
[SPEAKER_11]: I greatly appreciate this new job description and the orientation towards not treating our students as if there's something wrong with them.

888
02:23:15,705 --> 02:23:23,088
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, just the general approach of the district is definitely going in the right direction.

889
02:23:23,128 --> 02:23:26,009
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm very, very proud of that job posting.

890
02:23:26,169 --> 02:23:30,171
[SPEAKER_11]: It says a lot, frankly, about where we are going.

891
02:23:30,531 --> 02:23:32,572
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I motion for approval of the change.

892
02:23:35,313 --> 02:23:37,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Member van de Kloot, then member Graham.

893
02:23:40,255 --> 02:23:44,199
[SPEAKER_03]: I also appreciated the job description and the intent behind it.

894
02:23:44,940 --> 02:23:45,941
[SPEAKER_03]: I would second the motion.

895
02:23:48,223 --> 02:23:48,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Grimm?

896
02:23:53,788 --> 02:23:57,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I generally am sort of in the same place.

897
02:23:58,253 --> 02:24:00,495
[SPEAKER_04]: I just had a couple of questions or thoughts.

898
02:24:03,188 --> 02:24:17,933
[SPEAKER_04]: My first question is, I didn't see anything in the essential duties that talks about this individual needing to be able to sort of connect students and families to services available in the network around them.

899
02:24:18,734 --> 02:24:22,675
[SPEAKER_04]: And I did a little bit of quick poking around at some other similar job descriptions.

900
02:24:22,755 --> 02:24:31,078
[SPEAKER_04]: And that stood out to me as something that when you're talking about re-engagement of a student who is sort of not where we want them to be,

901
02:24:31,758 --> 02:24:51,944
[SPEAKER_04]: that we all sort of recognize it's probably not their fault, there's something else going on, but like we have to sort of step, I think we have to be able to step in and find some ways to fix the stuff going on or try to address or try to connect them to the people who can help them address the thing that is going on.

902
02:24:52,044 --> 02:24:58,506
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would love to see us add that to the essential duties that that person can be expected to

903
02:25:00,847 --> 02:25:06,309
[SPEAKER_04]: sort of help with that like support net in terms of connecting people.

904
02:25:06,349 --> 02:25:10,371
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've talked before about like, is their family signed up for free reduced lunch?

905
02:25:10,451 --> 02:25:20,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Like what are all the things that they require in order to sort of get on a more sustainable path forward to graduation?

906
02:25:21,175 --> 02:25:25,737
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that would be a really meaningful addition to the list.

907
02:25:27,919 --> 02:25:30,560
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the other thing that jumped out at me is in the credentials.

908
02:25:31,040 --> 02:25:41,264
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to see us remove criminal justice and law enforcement as a thing we're specifically calling out that we're looking for a degree in.

909
02:25:41,484 --> 02:25:53,670
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't think it means we couldn't embrace a candidate that has a degree in criminal justice, but given how progressive this is otherwise,

910
02:25:55,718 --> 02:26:02,564
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think we're gaining anything by calling that out except scrutiny about whether this is just window dressing.

911
02:26:02,764 --> 02:26:04,146
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't believe it is.

912
02:26:04,246 --> 02:26:09,530
[SPEAKER_04]: So perhaps there's a way for us to remove that before we post the job.

913
02:26:10,872 --> 02:26:27,922
[SPEAKER_04]: And then my other question was whether you have talked at all about what role, if any, this individual plays as we think about implementing our out-of-school suspension policy, and is there connectivity there or not?

914
02:26:28,742 --> 02:26:30,403
[SPEAKER_04]: That just didn't jump out at me one way or the other.

915
02:26:30,423 --> 02:26:31,884
[SPEAKER_12]: Those are all three.

916
02:26:32,822 --> 02:26:34,123
[SPEAKER_12]: great points there.

917
02:26:34,143 --> 02:26:36,445
[SPEAKER_12]: If it's okay, if I could just quickly respond to what I think.

918
02:26:37,005 --> 02:26:50,475
[SPEAKER_12]: So typically, when the district is making minor revisions to job descriptions to just be consistent with responsibilities, we don't bring every single one of those to the school committee, I can't imagine you would want us to bring every single one of those to the school committee.

919
02:26:50,715 --> 02:26:52,716
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think the suggestions that Ms.

920
02:26:52,757 --> 02:26:57,360
[SPEAKER_12]: Kravitz made, particularly the first one with respect to making sure that there's the capacity to avail

921
02:26:57,923 --> 02:27:03,744
[SPEAKER_12]: themselves or the district of services that are available through the government, nonprofit partners, and so on and so forth.

922
02:27:04,044 --> 02:27:09,045
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think there's any question that the job description would be enhanced by adding a bullet point to that effect.

923
02:27:09,525 --> 02:27:25,669
[SPEAKER_12]: With respect to the criminal justice piece, this is a, at least it should be, and I don't have it in front of me this second, but this should be essentially a, the attempt is to sort of minimize the emphasis on criminal justice

924
02:27:26,182 --> 02:27:30,203
[SPEAKER_12]: for the reasons that you, or criminal justice credentials for the reasons that you are stating.

925
02:27:31,384 --> 02:27:52,772
[SPEAKER_12]: I will have to defer to the committee, frankly, as to whether it should be fully excised, because while I do think it should be minimized, there are many individuals who have worked in various aspects of the criminal justice system, whose credentials and frankly, whose priorities and values very much would align with what we're trying to do.

926
02:27:53,998 --> 02:28:06,943
[SPEAKER_12]: elements of, and certainly individuals who have worked in criminal justice field and law enforcement who very much have a restorative orientation when it comes to particularly working with children.

927
02:28:07,303 --> 02:28:17,066
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think I'm just in front of the superintendent, the school committee, I don't have an opinion on whether that should be listed or not.

928
02:28:17,626 --> 02:28:21,588
[SPEAKER_12]: I do think it is something that when we are looking at people, candidates,

929
02:28:23,228 --> 02:28:27,671
[SPEAKER_12]: it is likely to me that there will be good candidates coming out of those fields.

930
02:28:28,352 --> 02:28:39,640
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't think we want to, I think, well, I think that into some respect, the sort of target audience is the community to make sure that we're accurately expressing our values as an organization.

931
02:28:40,080 --> 02:28:43,363
[SPEAKER_12]: The other target audience is the prospective candidate pool.

932
02:28:43,683 --> 02:28:45,644
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't want to do anything to diminish that.

933
02:28:46,445 --> 02:28:48,686
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that's just something we'd want to take into account.

934
02:28:49,207 --> 02:28:50,508
[SPEAKER_12]: And with respect to the,

935
02:28:51,792 --> 02:29:14,316
[SPEAKER_12]: the sort of direction that the district is going with regards to student discipline, I would say absolutely that this is a position that we'll be working closely with principals and other administrators to ensure that the values that were represented in the committee's previous discussion related to restorative practices is reflected in this individual and in this role once it's built.

936
02:29:21,489 --> 02:29:26,130
[SPEAKER_06]: Member, I feel like somebody else had their hand up, but I see Member Russo right now.

937
02:29:27,931 --> 02:29:28,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Russo.

938
02:29:28,271 --> 02:29:28,571
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

939
02:29:29,551 --> 02:29:30,252
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

940
02:29:30,992 --> 02:29:35,933
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Graham's excellent analysis of this.

941
02:29:35,953 --> 02:29:39,294
[SPEAKER_11]: I've read this twice, and I didn't see any of those things, and I agree with them all.

942
02:29:43,616 --> 02:29:46,437
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the criminal justice law enforcement

943
02:29:49,613 --> 02:29:51,254
[SPEAKER_11]: piece of the credentials.

944
02:29:51,814 --> 02:30:14,241
[SPEAKER_11]: I certainly see Mr. Murphy's point about making sure that we get a pool of people who, you know, the interviewers will, of course, be able to get in much greater detail about any of these, you know, somebody who has a social worker, psychology, counseling or education degree that doesn't make them the right candidate.

945
02:30:15,961 --> 02:30:18,882
[SPEAKER_11]: And they could have those degrees and a law enforcement candidate.

946
02:30:19,775 --> 02:30:20,756
[SPEAKER_11]: a law enforcement degree.

947
02:30:21,316 --> 02:30:31,262
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that the part of the sentence that member Graham said was actually most compelling to me was the concern for window dressing.

948
02:30:33,063 --> 02:30:44,570
[SPEAKER_11]: And it is not unreasonable to read these credentials and see that listed there and put it up against the rest of the job description.

949
02:30:46,187 --> 02:30:55,495
[SPEAKER_11]: And when you read the rest of the job description, it actually does sort of feel like a bit of a surprise that somebody from law enforcement would be a right candidate.

950
02:30:55,555 --> 02:31:07,966
[SPEAKER_11]: Now I understand as Mr. Murphy said that, you know, there are plenty of people in law enforcement who come from with a restorative justice approach and obviously we want them to apply and be part of the candidate pool.

951
02:31:08,146 --> 02:31:13,931
[SPEAKER_11]: But I do feel like I would support removing that because

952
02:31:15,747 --> 02:31:19,589
[SPEAKER_11]: Partially because of the feeling of, is this just window dressing?

953
02:31:20,569 --> 02:31:26,353
[SPEAKER_11]: But more because up against the rest of the job description, it sort of feels out of place.

954
02:31:27,153 --> 02:31:35,618
[SPEAKER_11]: At least from the general sense of, you know, what law enforcement means, which means different things to different people.

955
02:31:36,979 --> 02:31:41,602
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think law enforcement to most people does not include what the job description lists.

956
02:31:42,334 --> 02:31:44,936
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's why I would support removing that.

957
02:31:46,577 --> 02:31:53,062
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm amenable to removing it because we also say or other related fields.

958
02:31:53,282 --> 02:32:04,149
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can definitely remove that, add the additional bullet point about the support network.

959
02:32:05,050 --> 02:32:08,192
[SPEAKER_02]: And absolutely, we will definitely be having

960
02:32:09,817 --> 02:32:14,580
[SPEAKER_02]: whoever this re-engagement specialist is, working very closely with Ms.

961
02:32:14,600 --> 02:32:28,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Stacey Shulman and other administrators to be able to say, you know, these are the appropriate supporting resources, whether it's counseling or other things like that, working together with the team.

962
02:32:28,347 --> 02:32:37,252
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be, you know, just taking a new angle and really trying to look at this work from a proactive lens.

963
02:32:43,678 --> 02:32:46,340
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a motion for approval as amended?

964
02:32:47,220 --> 02:32:49,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to approve as amended.

965
02:32:49,902 --> 02:32:51,423
[SPEAKER_06]: By member Van de Kloet, seconded by?

966
02:32:51,443 --> 02:32:52,483
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

967
02:32:52,903 --> 02:32:55,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham, roll call?

968
02:32:56,846 --> 02:32:57,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Kretz?

969
02:32:58,587 --> 02:32:58,807
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

970
02:33:00,608 --> 02:33:01,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Graham?

971
02:33:01,829 --> 02:33:02,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

972
02:33:03,409 --> 02:33:04,650
[SPEAKER_07]: Member McLaughlin, yes.

973
02:33:04,850 --> 02:33:05,551
[SPEAKER_07]: Member McStone?

974
02:33:05,851 --> 02:33:06,091
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

975
02:33:08,432 --> 02:33:09,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Rousseau?

976
02:33:10,213 --> 02:33:10,413
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

977
02:33:11,474 --> 02:33:12,255
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Van de Kloet?

978
02:33:12,635 --> 02:33:12,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

979
02:33:13,720 --> 02:33:14,481
[SPEAKER_07]: Mayor Longo, Kern.

980
02:33:14,981 --> 02:33:16,943
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

981
02:33:17,123 --> 02:33:17,883
[SPEAKER_06]: Paper passes.

982
02:33:17,903 --> 02:33:19,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

983
02:33:19,945 --> 02:33:20,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

984
02:33:20,666 --> 02:33:26,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Number six, we have recommendation to approve superintendent goals for school year 2020-2021.

985
02:33:26,871 --> 02:33:28,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Maurice Edward-Vincent.

986
02:33:31,875 --> 02:33:38,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Just going to screen share my school goals, my superintendent goals for school year 2021.

987
02:33:38,400 --> 02:33:41,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Just one moment, please.

988
02:34:04,057 --> 02:34:04,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening.

989
02:34:05,157 --> 02:34:09,939
[SPEAKER_02]: I am pleased to present to you my goals for this school year 2020-2021.

990
02:34:13,800 --> 02:34:33,467
[SPEAKER_02]: So my district improvement goal, I want to preface by just saying that, again, with the arrival of the pandemic a year ago, Medford Public Schools as a district, we needed to pivot quickly and prepare to meet the challenges created by the pandemic.

991
02:34:34,813 --> 02:34:48,897
[SPEAKER_02]: So in preparation for planning for the 2020-2021 school year, these preparations have been coordinated according to three key goals, our guiding pillars of safety, equity, and consistency.

992
02:34:51,897 --> 02:34:53,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Our first goal under safety

993
02:34:56,295 --> 02:35:13,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Our goal was to implement a district-wide reopening plan that met the guidelines from Massachusetts Department of Public Health and provided in-person learning opportunities for all students pre-K-12 who selected that option.

994
02:35:15,969 --> 02:35:19,952
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the key actions that took place that were aligned to safety

995
02:35:21,635 --> 02:35:26,958
[SPEAKER_02]: We created a staggered hybrid plan to better adapt to safety protocols in each building.

996
02:35:28,599 --> 02:35:35,283
[SPEAKER_02]: For phase one, we targeted our most vulnerable students in the buildings four days a week.

997
02:35:36,824 --> 02:35:42,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Phase two, staggered hybrid for all students in grades pre-K to 12.

998
02:35:44,791 --> 02:35:52,453
[SPEAKER_02]: We adopted building safety checklists to address our safety protocols and building readiness.

999
02:35:54,854 --> 02:36:10,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Launching an in-school COVID testing program in collaboration with Tufts University, Armstrong Ambulance, for all of our students and staff at the beginning of the school year.

1000
02:36:14,950 --> 02:36:25,756
[SPEAKER_02]: We are in the process of providing Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 rapid testing administered by school nurses.

1001
02:36:27,457 --> 02:36:36,001
[SPEAKER_02]: We established protocols and procedures for contact tracing for staff and students who test positive with COVID-19.

1002
02:36:37,021 --> 02:36:39,343
[SPEAKER_02]: And we developed an MOA

1003
02:36:40,442 --> 02:36:45,506
[SPEAKER_02]: with all collective bargaining units regarding reopening working conditions.

1004
02:36:46,546 --> 02:36:48,928
[SPEAKER_02]: All of those fell under the umbrella of safety.

1005
02:36:51,130 --> 02:37:00,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Under the category of equity, to provide all students with access to district opportunities to ensure individual student success.

1006
02:37:02,438 --> 02:37:09,923
[SPEAKER_02]: We provide all students with one-to-one devices in order for them to participate in the online learning.

1007
02:37:10,418 --> 02:37:13,079
[SPEAKER_02]: at home and at school.

1008
02:37:15,380 --> 02:37:23,324
[SPEAKER_02]: For some of our families that were most vulnerable, we provided home internet access points to students that needed it.

1009
02:37:25,505 --> 02:37:31,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Implementing improved hiring practices with diversity as a high consideration.

1010
02:37:34,169 --> 02:37:37,030
[SPEAKER_02]: We prioritized our most vulnerable students.

1011
02:37:39,568 --> 02:37:49,832
[SPEAKER_02]: We offered professional development that increases educators and administrators' cultural competency and fosters an anti-racist approach to education.

1012
02:37:52,793 --> 02:38:00,155
[SPEAKER_02]: To review current curriculum K-12 to ensure a balanced representation of diverse backgrounds and abilities.

1013
02:38:04,217 --> 02:38:07,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Established a racial equity task force.

1014
02:38:09,468 --> 02:38:18,978
[SPEAKER_02]: and to have support structures to assist with social emotional learning needs in responses to trauma in students.

1015
02:38:21,400 --> 02:38:23,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Under the umbrella of consistency,

1016
02:38:24,878 --> 02:38:44,073
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanted to prepare students, prepare our principals and other district leaders for remote and hybrid instruction by developing a common language and adopting common practices that ensure that all remote and hybrid students have access to high quality instruction.

1017
02:38:47,291 --> 02:38:54,894
[SPEAKER_02]: to develop a dynamic framework to adopt new models of learning for both in-person, hybrid, and remote.

1018
02:38:56,855 --> 02:39:02,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Create a document that details expectations for teachers, students, and families.

1019
02:39:04,278 --> 02:39:08,320
[SPEAKER_02]: Establish a remote academy at the elementary level.

1020
02:39:10,661 --> 02:39:13,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Design equitable, hybrid, and remote schedules.

1021
02:39:16,120 --> 02:39:21,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Establish structures for synchronous learning and asynchronous lessons.

1022
02:39:22,941 --> 02:39:25,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Update curriculum pacing guides.

1023
02:39:27,862 --> 02:39:31,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Provide professional development programs on remote teaching.

1024
02:39:34,603 --> 02:39:39,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Provide teachers with devices to better teach remotely and in person.

1025
02:39:40,244 --> 02:39:43,245
[SPEAKER_02]: MacBooks, microphones, and webcams.

1026
02:39:45,516 --> 02:39:56,059
[SPEAKER_02]: improve internet bandwidth issues in school buildings, and upgrade Zoom license for better teacher access.

1027
02:39:59,581 --> 02:40:13,505
[SPEAKER_02]: My student learning goal, again, with the continued focus of elementary mathematics, improve elementary achievement outcomes in mathematics by deepening teacher and principal knowledge of math.

1028
02:40:15,260 --> 02:40:22,646
[SPEAKER_02]: My key actions support the development and implementation of an effective elementary math program.

1029
02:40:24,347 --> 02:40:34,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Conduct virtual math learning walks district-wide with a modified protocol to include the five core actions in math, one to two times a year.

1030
02:40:35,796 --> 02:40:38,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Ensuring consistent implementation of envisions

1031
02:40:41,688 --> 02:40:52,155
[SPEAKER_02]: 2015, which is the current curriculum that we are using, and the modified math pacing guides for the remainder of school year, 20 to 21.

1032
02:40:54,016 --> 02:40:58,159
[SPEAKER_02]: Maintain our partnership with Lesley University.

1033
02:40:59,240 --> 02:41:03,723
[SPEAKER_02]: And under our student learning goal, I want to just note the benchmark.

1034
02:41:05,312 --> 02:41:10,796
[SPEAKER_02]: that due to the pandemic, no MCAS assessment was given during the spring of 2020.

1035
02:41:11,357 --> 02:41:19,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Neither were any in-district end-of-the-year assessments administered at the elementary level.

1036
02:41:21,344 --> 02:41:32,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Therefore, I will take the math end-of-year benchmark data from this school year and identify specific areas of need for our elementary students.

1037
02:41:33,597 --> 02:41:39,503
[SPEAKER_02]: This analysis will take place during the summer to inform school year 21-22.

1038
02:41:40,784 --> 02:41:49,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Furthermore, due to the pandemic, hard accurate data has been difficult to obtain because it has been interrupted twice.

1039
02:41:51,274 --> 02:41:55,138
[SPEAKER_02]: This year, although students will be taking an MCAS assessment,

1040
02:41:56,891 --> 02:42:04,998
[SPEAKER_02]: It is scheduled to be a modified MCAS assessment and it may be administered.

1041
02:42:06,180 --> 02:42:08,642
[SPEAKER_02]: We are not sure if that guidance will change.

1042
02:42:09,362 --> 02:42:19,071
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that was why I wanted to make this recommendation to use our math end of year benchmark data.

1043
02:42:20,207 --> 02:42:27,151
[SPEAKER_02]: as a key piece of information to inform us where our students currently are.

1044
02:42:29,553 --> 02:42:40,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Lastly, for a professional practice goal, under NISP, the New Superintendent Induction Program, I am currently in my third year of the induction program.

1045
02:42:41,780 --> 02:42:46,303
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition to participating in all the monthly Zoom sessions,

1046
02:42:47,586 --> 02:42:50,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Due to the pandemic, there are no in-person sessions.

1047
02:42:51,288 --> 02:42:53,249
[SPEAKER_02]: I do attend the monthly Zoom sessions.

1048
02:42:53,669 --> 02:42:58,891
[SPEAKER_02]: We also, the NISP has started affinity group sessions.

1049
02:42:59,372 --> 02:43:04,734
[SPEAKER_02]: So I am attending affinity group sessions, which discuss issues of equity.

1050
02:43:05,214 --> 02:43:12,958
[SPEAKER_02]: So I am now attending two meetings a month, completing all requested assignments,

1051
02:43:13,898 --> 02:43:32,605
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm continuing to work in collaboration with my coach, Carla Bair, and the outcome of the NSUP program would be to finalize the district strategic plan, because it is now currently still in its draft state.

1052
02:43:33,645 --> 02:43:36,166
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are my goals for school year 2020-2021.

1053
02:43:50,532 --> 02:44:07,455
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Edward Vincent, it's not a goal for this year necessarily, but to start conversations with regards to bringing our kids back to school at a more normal pace in September.

1054
02:44:07,475 --> 02:44:19,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Has that been just discussed and should it be part of your goals as far as working with all unions to try to get back to a normal schedule come September?

1055
02:44:22,640 --> 02:44:31,588
[SPEAKER_02]: We definitely, at the central office level, working with the leadership team, have already begun the preliminary conversations.

1056
02:44:31,648 --> 02:44:46,141
[SPEAKER_02]: We would like to replicate, not identically, but a very similar fashion to engage community stakeholders and families, all administrators, teachers about

1057
02:44:46,945 --> 02:44:48,425
[SPEAKER_02]: preparing for school year 21, 22.

1058
02:44:48,545 --> 02:44:59,929
[SPEAKER_02]: That is definitely something that will be, and as we do that work, we will continue to look at safety, equity, and consistency.

1059
02:45:00,749 --> 02:45:13,373
[SPEAKER_02]: And with the fact that the vaccine phase two between February and March, educators having the opportunity to be

1060
02:45:14,633 --> 02:45:15,374
[SPEAKER_02]: vaccinated.

1061
02:45:15,394 --> 02:45:18,298
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that that is a great, you know, relief.

1062
02:45:19,439 --> 02:45:22,783
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know yet what the data is going to be for students.

1063
02:45:23,524 --> 02:45:28,170
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're still trying to, you know, find out what that will look like.

1064
02:45:28,390 --> 02:45:30,473
[SPEAKER_02]: I, you know, I have heard that

1065
02:45:30,893 --> 02:45:39,756
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, maybe it will be students 12 and over that may be able to be vaccinated, but we're just not sure yet with all of the different phases.

1066
02:45:41,097 --> 02:45:50,781
[SPEAKER_02]: We probably will not be hearing information yet about student vaccinations until we get closer to the summer.

1067
02:45:51,421 --> 02:45:56,023
[SPEAKER_02]: But that is definitely work that we are committed to doing.

1068
02:45:56,643 --> 02:46:04,125
[SPEAKER_02]: doing collaboratively and transparently with the committee and you know with the community.

1069
02:46:05,365 --> 02:46:05,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1070
02:46:09,766 --> 02:46:10,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Member McLaughlin.

1071
02:46:12,166 --> 02:46:12,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1072
02:46:12,866 --> 02:46:24,889
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you Dr. Edward Vincent for presenting these goals and I'm eager to you know look more toward the equity and aspect and

1073
02:46:25,566 --> 02:46:25,992
[SPEAKER_07]: some of the...

1074
02:46:27,141 --> 02:46:27,981
[SPEAKER_07]: items that you mentioned.

1075
02:46:28,021 --> 02:46:33,243
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm wondering, I know that we have it on the agenda to vote on these goals tonight.

1076
02:46:33,263 --> 02:46:41,205
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm wondering if it would be acceptable to you and to my colleagues if we might digest this and vote on them at the next meeting.

1077
02:46:41,265 --> 02:46:51,228
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like, you know, with it being 10 of nine and this sort of being the end of the meeting, it's a little bit, it's a lot to sort of digest right at this point.

1078
02:46:51,288 --> 02:46:56,630
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would respectfully ask if we might be able to vote on these for the next session.

1079
02:46:57,858 --> 02:46:57,998
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1080
02:46:58,539 --> 02:47:02,842
[SPEAKER_06]: We can entertain that motion, maybe after the questions.

1081
02:47:05,344 --> 02:47:07,165
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds like a good idea.

1082
02:47:07,545 --> 02:47:08,146
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham.

1083
02:47:11,988 --> 02:47:12,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Um.

1084
02:47:13,369 --> 02:47:13,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for this.

1085
02:47:14,310 --> 02:47:19,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Um as I'm digesting this, I guess I have a couple of thoughts rolling through my mind.

1086
02:47:19,454 --> 02:47:20,254
[SPEAKER_04]: So you know,

1087
02:47:28,371 --> 02:47:30,492
[SPEAKER_04]: for all intents and purposes, practically over.

1088
02:47:31,112 --> 02:47:42,257
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a little bit awkward to be talking about goals now because whatever they might be, there's very little time to actually execute on them unless you've already done the things.

1089
02:47:42,377 --> 02:47:46,299
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it looks like we're just saying yes to the things you've already done.

1090
02:47:46,419 --> 02:47:50,301
[SPEAKER_04]: So the timing of this conversation is a little bit weird.

1091
02:47:52,061 --> 02:47:55,003
[SPEAKER_04]: So I do think that a lot of the things that have

1092
02:47:55,623 --> 02:48:18,820
[SPEAKER_04]: take in just an enormous amount of time from a district-wide planning perspective belong in that first category, but I would like to see us think about what are our objectives to be contained in this school year that will allow us to be more prepared than we were in August, September of last year for the next school year.

1093
02:48:18,840 --> 02:48:24,364
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would like to see something added that is forward-looking that is yet to be accomplished and

1094
02:48:25,468 --> 02:48:36,399
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not suggesting that we've sort of checked the box and everything that's already there, because I know it's sort of a constant evolution, no shortage of work, but I do think we should think about something there.

1095
02:48:37,700 --> 02:48:46,770
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I think the other thing that is sort of rattling around in my head is when I think about math, I just have some real questions about

1096
02:48:48,368 --> 02:48:58,443
[SPEAKER_04]: The continued viability of this being our district wide goal our district wide goal, I mean when I think about where we're at right now, like we have an elementary school math curriculum that.

1097
02:49:00,105 --> 02:49:04,612
[SPEAKER_04]: we're considering replacing that you know by by lots of accounts doesn't work.

1098
02:49:05,273 --> 02:49:21,099
[SPEAKER_04]: And yet, we're expecting the results to change in some significant fashion and I just don't think that's possible like there's, there's just not enough gain to eat out of the system without foundational support that aligns with where we're trying to go.

1099
02:49:23,080 --> 02:49:30,365
[SPEAKER_04]: We have this like, we've always used MCAS as an assessment tool to sort of quantify this.

1100
02:49:30,405 --> 02:49:39,590
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the point of this goal is that it is quantifiable and that's gonna be challenging in general this year because of where we're at.

1101
02:49:41,471 --> 02:49:50,877
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I think about literacy and I think about the fact that we have been doing assessment in the literacy space

1102
02:49:53,772 --> 02:49:58,153
[SPEAKER_04]: for like last year and then continuing into this year.

1103
02:49:59,553 --> 02:50:06,055
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't have the sort of energy or wrapped up in it that MCAS does.

1104
02:50:06,135 --> 02:50:09,415
[SPEAKER_04]: So people have very strong feelings about the MCAS this year.

1105
02:50:09,455 --> 02:50:16,137
[SPEAKER_04]: So even if it goes, what the data will tell us, I think is up for question and debate.

1106
02:50:16,277 --> 02:50:20,398
[SPEAKER_04]: But those early literacy assessments, like I've not heard people recoiling against

1107
02:50:21,358 --> 02:50:25,420
[SPEAKER_04]: the literacy assessments that we're doing for some of our youngest learners.

1108
02:50:27,081 --> 02:50:42,607
[SPEAKER_04]: And I do think about, you know, when we talk about district-wide effectiveness, when we talk about students that need support from the district, not just in those early days, but in an ongoing fashion, is math the reason they need

1109
02:50:44,738 --> 02:50:49,963
[SPEAKER_04]: support or is it literacy that is sort of at the base of our struggle?

1110
02:50:50,043 --> 02:51:10,161
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess having said all that, it is the end of January and sort of changing gears in terms of focus is problematic to be doing at this point in the year, but I just can't see myself being super supportive of continuing to go after

1111
02:51:11,167 --> 02:51:23,272
[SPEAKER_04]: math MCAS scores, knowing that the foundation is sort of not where it needs to be to help get us there, and knowing that we have this like sort of pressing need from a literacy perspective.

1112
02:51:23,372 --> 02:51:34,856
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm also in favor of not voting on this tonight because I feel pretty conflicted about where this is versus sort of where I would like to see us be.

1113
02:51:37,736 --> 02:51:51,523
[SPEAKER_02]: So the only piece I want to say in response to that is, especially when you're looking at data, there was clearly a gap between mathematics and literacy.

1114
02:51:52,285 --> 02:52:01,416
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that I am prioritizing one content area over another, but in order to see if growth is happening, you need to be able to stick with something.

1115
02:52:03,179 --> 02:52:10,928
[SPEAKER_02]: From the time of looking at math instruction from year one, when the rounds were happening, using the core actions,

1116
02:52:11,609 --> 02:52:14,471
[SPEAKER_02]: and trying to stay with the work that we've done.

1117
02:52:14,531 --> 02:52:17,794
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the data of the rooms that we have visited.

1118
02:52:18,554 --> 02:52:35,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though now we're on these COVID conditions, the modified pacing guides, using a protocol that was in place, looking at the same content, that there is some data in terms of the progress and work that was happening.

1119
02:52:38,259 --> 02:52:50,768
[SPEAKER_02]: by looking at the data, even though it's different data, it at least I'm able to link it and connect it to what was being done in the previous years.

1120
02:52:51,688 --> 02:52:54,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Literacy is definitely also a priority.

1121
02:52:55,531 --> 02:52:58,573
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that we're not prioritizing literacy,

1122
02:52:58,969 --> 02:53:06,491
[SPEAKER_02]: But all the work that has happened thus far, the primary focus had been to reshift what was happening in mathematics.

1123
02:53:06,931 --> 02:53:13,993
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were able to see changes instructionally and see that the needle was beginning to move.

1124
02:53:14,433 --> 02:53:18,034
[SPEAKER_02]: And the needle was moving in terms of mathematics instruction.

1125
02:53:19,234 --> 02:53:28,317
[SPEAKER_02]: I could see myself, even though I said I want to look at the mathematics data at this year to help inform what's going to be happening in school year

1126
02:53:29,365 --> 02:53:45,299
[SPEAKER_02]: 21, 22, the goals for school year 21, 22, that could be a clear, a cleaner opportunity to say, we're gonna do a shift and do a instructional shift at that point in time.

1127
02:53:45,759 --> 02:53:55,728
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just feel the investment and the amount of time that has gone into mathematics, I need to continue seeing that work through.

1128
02:53:56,464 --> 02:54:00,988
[SPEAKER_02]: And even though we're on the covert schedule instruction is still happening.

1129
02:54:01,708 --> 02:54:06,352
[SPEAKER_02]: And I need to be able to look at where that data lands.

1130
02:54:07,093 --> 02:54:11,496
[SPEAKER_02]: At the end of this year, where do we land, because in order to make a data informed decision.

1131
02:54:12,446 --> 02:54:16,488
[SPEAKER_02]: you have to be able to have something to look at and where we were in the past.

1132
02:54:17,148 --> 02:54:26,852
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, where I clearly stated it's two years that were interrupted of interrupted data, data sets.

1133
02:54:28,613 --> 02:54:36,917
[SPEAKER_02]: I am no longer gonna be able to use the MCAS per se because even the MCAS that will be administered this year

1134
02:54:38,558 --> 02:54:40,039
[SPEAKER_02]: is going to be modified.

1135
02:54:40,099 --> 02:54:46,863
[SPEAKER_02]: At least that's the information we were receiving that it will not be what was given in the past.

1136
02:54:47,243 --> 02:55:05,115
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a different assessment, but from an in-house internal perspective, we can look at our own internal data and use that as a jumping off point to further inform the instructional moves that we need to make as a district.

1137
02:55:06,736 --> 02:55:15,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and as I said, I recognize that it's practically February and now is a really unfair time to shift the goals.

1138
02:55:15,421 --> 02:55:19,403
[SPEAKER_04]: So I get that.

1139
02:55:19,523 --> 02:55:28,608
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's just more like a general frustration that we're sort of in this situation where we don't actually have the ability to have a real goals discussion because we can't.

1140
02:55:29,508 --> 02:55:31,949
[SPEAKER_04]: But having said that, I do think

1141
02:55:33,820 --> 02:55:42,049
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, when we talk about some of the things that are happening between now and the end of the year, really thinking about how will we assess

1142
02:55:43,439 --> 02:55:53,086
[SPEAKER_04]: the impact of these last two years on our students so that next year we're prepared to sort of take action is something I would like to see there.

1143
02:55:54,548 --> 02:56:03,154
[SPEAKER_04]: And I cannot fathom any support I would have for not prioritizing literacy as part of your goals starting next year at minimum.

1144
02:56:03,394 --> 02:56:04,815
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just

1145
02:56:06,323 --> 02:56:15,987
[SPEAKER_04]: I, okay, if there's more than one goal, but I don't think we can bypass literacy for too much longer for lots of reasons.

1146
02:56:16,067 --> 02:56:30,132
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and I think if we really think about like how kids are gonna get left behind in all of this, I'm really worried about those young learners and the, you know, teaching literacy two days a week and over Zoom.

1147
02:56:30,392 --> 02:56:31,873
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just incredibly,

1148
02:56:32,906 --> 02:56:46,768
[SPEAKER_04]: It's incredibly hard and I would totally defer to you all on what those measures are and metrics are and sort of where we're at, but that's sort of what my thinking is right now, but I do support us revisiting this next time.

1149
02:56:48,749 --> 02:56:49,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Russo.

1150
02:56:51,309 --> 02:56:52,069
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

1151
02:56:52,269 --> 02:56:57,810
[SPEAKER_11]: And I do agree with the other members that have spoken about the check.

1152
02:56:57,910 --> 02:57:00,891
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually had to say, wait, which year are we doing these for?

1153
02:57:01,860 --> 02:57:06,103
[SPEAKER_11]: It's awkward to talk about goals for a year that is more than half over.

1154
02:57:07,445 --> 02:57:17,733
[SPEAKER_11]: But so, you know, in the last goal setting that we had, which was before times, so I can't even remember when that was.

1155
02:57:18,584 --> 02:57:25,865
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I had indicated that we, I thought while math was very important, I thought literacy should be the primary goal.

1156
02:57:26,365 --> 02:57:31,426
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm reminded, I keep a short list of 10 things to try to remember in my meetings.

1157
02:57:31,486 --> 02:57:36,587
[SPEAKER_11]: And one of them is Campbell's law, that what you measure is what will gain the focus of those being measured.

1158
02:57:37,668 --> 02:57:45,229
[SPEAKER_11]: We can say we have multiple number one priorities, but if we're only looking and measuring on one of them, then we really only have one.

1159
02:57:47,021 --> 02:58:03,566
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I would urge the superintendent to consider that when we do the goals for the 2021-2022 school year, I know I will be pushing as well for literacy and like anything, none of this is free.

1160
02:58:04,606 --> 02:58:14,870
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm assuming if we didn't need anything at all for the district, then we'd have 100% of the kids reading at grade level by third grade and we wouldn't be talking about it.

1161
02:58:16,502 --> 02:58:20,784
[SPEAKER_11]: when we are discussing the budget, I realize it's a bit of a weird thing.

1162
02:58:20,864 --> 02:58:23,225
[SPEAKER_11]: Like we haven't set the goals for the next year.

1163
02:58:23,925 --> 02:58:33,769
[SPEAKER_11]: So budgeting for goals that we may set, and you may agree to later on, it sounds a little precarious.

1164
02:58:34,249 --> 02:58:39,312
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm not sure the people who set up the new goal system actually thought that through.

1165
02:58:41,484 --> 02:59:04,970
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, I think that if there are going to be substantial costs to measurable increases in literacy, that it's best to not lose an entire year where we set the goals for July one, and you don't have any of the resources you need to implement them until the following year, because that's not going to make it possible to meet your goals.

1166
02:59:05,450 --> 02:59:09,091
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would just urge you to, I don't know who would be doing this, but to

1167
02:59:09,820 --> 02:59:12,941
[SPEAKER_11]: actually think about some of that when doing the budget.

1168
02:59:14,382 --> 02:59:26,868
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm not a literacy specialist, I have no idea what kinds of costs are involved with training and additional professional development and any materials and specialists and all that other stuff.

1169
02:59:26,988 --> 02:59:36,833
[SPEAKER_11]: But it is a concern I have that if we set any goal for literacy next year, that is it even going to be attainable if there's no money to do any of it?

1170
02:59:38,965 --> 02:59:47,091
[SPEAKER_11]: I also support taking this paper and moving it to the next meeting so we can digest it.

1171
02:59:47,351 --> 02:59:47,692
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1172
02:59:50,353 --> 02:59:51,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Member van de Kloot?

1173
02:59:52,715 --> 03:00:01,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I just think it's important to mention, since two of my colleagues mentioned that we're sort of late into the year of setting these goals,

1174
03:00:02,285 --> 03:00:12,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Is saying that we're so yay late because there's a pandemic and the superintendents was working as many of us noted Earlier around the clock for such a long time.

1175
03:00:12,790 --> 03:00:13,230
[SPEAKER_03]: And so

1176
03:00:13,965 --> 03:00:14,505
[SPEAKER_03]: so hard.

1177
03:00:14,585 --> 03:00:19,809
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wanted to thank her for all the work that she's done at this point.

1178
03:00:21,050 --> 03:00:34,398
[SPEAKER_03]: And while I certainly support looking at the goals for another week and revisiting them, I just think it's really, really important to acknowledge all the incredible work the superintendent and her team has done.

1179
03:00:38,381 --> 03:00:39,462
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, member van de Kloot.

1180
03:00:40,862 --> 03:00:41,563
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Kretz.

1181
03:00:45,999 --> 03:00:48,660
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to ditto on what Ms.

1182
03:00:48,680 --> 03:00:54,862
[SPEAKER_15]: Van de Kloot said, and I just want to thank the superintendent and her administrative team for all their hard work all year.

1183
03:00:55,062 --> 03:01:07,005
[SPEAKER_15]: And I will say, if my colleagues want to hold off on approving this until next week, I support giving it the extra week so that they can have some more time to review this.

1184
03:01:08,965 --> 03:01:09,826
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Member Kretz.

1185
03:01:10,886 --> 03:01:12,966
[SPEAKER_06]: If I just may ask one question, too.

1186
03:01:13,007 --> 03:01:14,287
[SPEAKER_06]: I know on

1187
03:01:15,377 --> 03:01:16,198
[SPEAKER_06]: was the first page.

1188
03:01:17,799 --> 03:01:21,581
[SPEAKER_06]: You mentioned professional development opportunities, and I know they've been enhanced.

1189
03:01:21,901 --> 03:01:32,928
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to see if there's any polling of teachers or surveys that are done or could be done to just further enhance that.

1190
03:01:33,648 --> 03:01:40,773
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it's part of your goal, so how do we make sure we're getting the right PD for our teachers to move the district forward?

1191
03:01:43,030 --> 03:02:01,562
[SPEAKER_02]: When PD takes place, even last week's professional development, the teachers normally have an opportunity to give a feedback form, but I can definitely work on trying to create additional opportunities to get feedback.

1192
03:02:03,203 --> 03:02:03,944
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be great.

1193
03:02:04,024 --> 03:02:04,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1194
03:02:04,484 --> 03:02:09,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, because I hear a lot of people that love the PD, and then you hear from teachers saying, this is the same thing.

1195
03:02:09,488 --> 03:02:10,028
[SPEAKER_06]: I've taken this.

1196
03:02:10,836 --> 03:02:11,756
[SPEAKER_06]: multiple times.

1197
03:02:11,816 --> 03:02:13,137
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not learning anything.

1198
03:02:13,157 --> 03:02:19,159
[SPEAKER_06]: So we would just want to make sure we're providing the opportunities to our teachers and the best we can.

1199
03:02:19,259 --> 03:02:30,042
[SPEAKER_06]: So survey or getting input from the teachers is just a great avenue that would be a good goal for either the end of the year or sometime a survey beginning of the school year next year.

1200
03:02:30,382 --> 03:02:31,483
[SPEAKER_06]: Just wanted to throw that out there.

1201
03:02:33,743 --> 03:02:38,345
[SPEAKER_06]: So member McLaughlin, is there a motion to table until the next meeting?

1202
03:02:39,803 --> 03:02:49,709
[SPEAKER_07]: There is motion to table the superintendent's proposed goals for the 2021 school year until our February 8th meeting.

1203
03:02:51,170 --> 03:02:54,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Great, seconded by member Rousseau, roll call.

1204
03:02:56,474 --> 03:02:58,055
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Graham, I mean member Kratz.

1205
03:02:58,955 --> 03:02:59,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1206
03:03:00,616 --> 03:03:01,577
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Graham.

1207
03:03:02,477 --> 03:03:02,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1208
03:03:03,778 --> 03:03:05,239
[SPEAKER_07]: Member McLaughlin, yes.

1209
03:03:05,279 --> 03:03:06,000
[SPEAKER_07]: Member McStone.

1210
03:03:06,180 --> 03:03:06,460
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1211
03:03:07,240 --> 03:03:07,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Rousseau.

1212
03:03:12,090 --> 03:03:12,330
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1213
03:03:13,030 --> 03:03:13,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1214
03:03:15,231 --> 03:03:16,271
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1215
03:03:16,291 --> 03:03:17,831
[SPEAKER_06]: 70 affirmative, zero in the negative.

1216
03:03:17,851 --> 03:03:25,734
[SPEAKER_06]: The paper is tabled until February 8th.

1217
03:03:26,034 --> 03:03:27,614
[SPEAKER_06]: Next up, we have old business.

1218
03:03:27,694 --> 03:03:28,774
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't believe there is any.

1219
03:03:31,035 --> 03:03:33,576
[SPEAKER_06]: And number 10, we have communications.

1220
03:03:36,197 --> 03:03:37,357
[SPEAKER_06]: First, we have new business.

1221
03:03:38,565 --> 03:03:41,446
[SPEAKER_06]: This is offered by member Russo.

1222
03:03:42,606 --> 03:04:02,492
[SPEAKER_06]: Given that attendance is a required first step in educating our students and given that excessive focus on attendance can lead to ill students and staff coming into school when they are contagious and with the potential to harm other students, staff and families, the attendance policy will be sent to the rules policy and equity subcommittee for review and update.

1223
03:04:05,305 --> 03:04:12,673
[SPEAKER_06]: as needed to ensure that it prohibits awards or recognitions of any kind being conferred within Medford Public Schools for perfect attendance.

1224
03:04:13,294 --> 03:04:13,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Russo.

1225
03:04:13,915 --> 03:04:15,817
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mayor.

1226
03:04:16,217 --> 03:04:21,183
[SPEAKER_11]: This has actually been on my list long before the pandemic and suddenly is particularly relevant.

1227
03:04:22,779 --> 03:04:28,481
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, there are, you know, families who will have a parent going through chemotherapy.

1228
03:04:29,061 --> 03:04:30,381
[SPEAKER_11]: They send their kids to school.

1229
03:04:30,481 --> 03:04:32,761
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, this is pre-pandemic.

1230
03:04:32,861 --> 03:04:34,602
[SPEAKER_11]: The problem is, of course, much worse now.

1231
03:04:35,342 --> 03:04:45,264
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, the kids will go to school and, you know, they will be interacting with family, with students, and sometimes even staff that are clearly too ill to be in school.

1232
03:04:46,605 --> 03:04:48,245
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously addressing the staff

1233
03:04:49,230 --> 03:05:04,210
[SPEAKER_11]: Difficulties around that is outside of really the purview of the school committee, I think that that's really too complicated, but I know I when I was growing up, there was incredible pride in perfect attendance and of course.

1234
03:05:05,268 --> 03:05:06,549
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't think anything of it.

1235
03:05:06,749 --> 03:05:19,937
[SPEAKER_11]: I certainly wasn't one of those students with perfect attendance, but it really becomes very logical that rewarding perfect attendance means incenting people to come to school sick.

1236
03:05:20,378 --> 03:05:24,941
[SPEAKER_11]: And coming to school because you have the sniffles on the surface doesn't matter.

1237
03:05:24,961 --> 03:05:30,024
[SPEAKER_11]: And of course, I don't mean the sniffles, but coming to school ill may not seem

1238
03:05:30,740 --> 03:05:41,569
[SPEAKER_11]: terrible until you consider that you may be giving something to another student or a staff member who's gonna go home and cause a parent who has no immune system to die.

1239
03:05:41,809 --> 03:05:52,518
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think we need to make sure there is no rewards and no incenting perfect attendance in any way, shape or form throughout the district.

1240
03:05:52,879 --> 03:05:58,163
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's why I put this on here and that's that.

1241
03:05:59,890 --> 03:06:00,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1242
03:06:00,251 --> 03:06:01,473
[SPEAKER_06]: A motion for, oh, member Kratz.

1243
03:06:05,579 --> 03:06:05,739
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1244
03:06:06,363 --> 03:06:09,665
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to say thank you for the resolution, Mr. Russo.

1245
03:06:09,845 --> 03:06:16,590
[SPEAKER_15]: And I just wanted to just express my thoughts that I'm not in favor of prohibiting perfect attendance.

1246
03:06:18,091 --> 03:06:23,515
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll vote to move it forward to the rules and equity subcommittee for a future discussion.

1247
03:06:23,535 --> 03:06:31,360
[SPEAKER_15]: And I hope that during the discussion that the subcommittee can determine some way to recognize students who have

1248
03:06:33,702 --> 03:06:37,465
[SPEAKER_15]: worked to obtain that perfect attendance.

1249
03:06:38,425 --> 03:06:46,911
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that, you know, you've mentioned that students are coming to school sick and that might not be all students and or all staff.

1250
03:06:47,251 --> 03:06:55,857
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just, you know, I hope that during the meeting, the subcommittee meeting, there can be a discussion about, you know, recognizing students in another way.

1251
03:06:56,318 --> 03:06:56,618
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe

1252
03:06:57,358 --> 03:07:06,101
[SPEAKER_15]: if there was excused absences, they wouldn't be counted against the student and it might not be a certificate, but just some way to recognize students.

1253
03:07:06,161 --> 03:07:11,703
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that this carries forward to the career and college world.

1254
03:07:12,163 --> 03:07:16,085
[SPEAKER_15]: I know at my work, we have a perfect attendance award.

1255
03:07:16,225 --> 03:07:17,105
[SPEAKER_15]: I take it seriously.

1256
03:07:17,305 --> 03:07:22,407
[SPEAKER_15]: If I'm sick, I'm not going to go in just because I want to get the perfect attendance award.

1257
03:07:22,867 --> 03:07:33,922
[SPEAKER_15]: So I don't think it's necessarily every student is going in and infecting other students, but I hope it's a good discussion at the subcommittee meeting.

1258
03:07:37,026 --> 03:07:37,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Member Kretz.

1259
03:07:37,886 --> 03:07:38,746
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Edward-Vincent.

1260
03:07:39,987 --> 03:07:56,750
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to say that I think I understand the thinking behind why we shouldn't recognize students who may have perfect attendance.

1261
03:07:56,810 --> 03:08:03,372
[SPEAKER_02]: But I want to give my own personal story that I was a student that didn't get sick.

1262
03:08:04,723 --> 03:08:05,423
[SPEAKER_02]: very easily.

1263
03:08:05,443 --> 03:08:09,485
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I must have had a strong immune system.

1264
03:08:10,765 --> 03:08:16,687
[SPEAKER_02]: And I never got sick from kindergarten to eighth grade.

1265
03:08:18,507 --> 03:08:28,771
[SPEAKER_02]: And my parents took pride in knowing that one of my siblings had seven years of perfect attendance.

1266
03:08:31,923 --> 03:08:53,917
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't go to school sick or try to get other people sick, but I'm also thinking about for those students that are able to go to school, for those parents that are able to say, you know, I may be going to work, but the one thing I'm gonna do is, you know, make sure you're ready to go to school and be successful in school.

1267
03:08:54,097 --> 03:08:57,680
[SPEAKER_02]: I happen to really like school a lot.

1268
03:08:59,462 --> 03:09:00,843
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I stayed in education.

1269
03:09:01,664 --> 03:09:04,707
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are some people who may have difficulty in school.

1270
03:09:05,027 --> 03:09:08,911
[SPEAKER_02]: They may have difficulty learning, but they actually like going to school.

1271
03:09:09,632 --> 03:09:15,197
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they might not get other, they might not get an academic recognition.

1272
03:09:15,878 --> 03:09:22,224
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they may not make the honor roll, but they may be able to be recognized for having perfect attendance.

1273
03:09:23,239 --> 03:09:38,551
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm just saying that I don't want it to be, for people to interpret it, that it's punitive if you're in school 180 days and you only get to go to school, you miss one day, so you don't get recognized.

1274
03:09:38,992 --> 03:09:41,654
[SPEAKER_02]: But for those kids that are able to do it,

1275
03:09:43,483 --> 03:10:03,250
[SPEAKER_02]: and not knowing what their home situation is, that could be something that motivates them to say, I might not get recognized for having all A's and B's, but at least I can be recognized for being at school and being a contributing member of the class and get recognized that way.

1276
03:10:03,290 --> 03:10:12,213
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just wanted to present that it doesn't have to be negative to recognize someone who has

1277
03:10:14,155 --> 03:10:15,075
[SPEAKER_02]: perfect attendance.

1278
03:10:15,636 --> 03:10:26,480
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just remember, you know, when they would say put your hat on or put your scarf scarf on, you know, you got to stay healthy, that it was like I was being responsible trying to stay healthy.

1279
03:10:27,380 --> 03:10:30,201
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just kind of feel like

1280
03:10:32,147 --> 03:10:45,557
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't want to, I know it's something that I received, but I wouldn't want to take it away from other children as a district to say that we cannot recognize students who do have perfect attendance.

1281
03:10:45,597 --> 03:10:53,783
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if someone is sick, the teachers will definitely send them to the nurse, nurse's office and say, you know, you're really sick.

1282
03:10:53,823 --> 03:10:57,305
[SPEAKER_02]: You shouldn't be in school or call to have someone pick them up.

1283
03:10:58,086 --> 03:11:00,668
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm saying for kids that aren't sick, um,

1284
03:11:02,731 --> 03:11:23,832
[SPEAKER_02]: that I just I just am asking the committee to think by taking away or saying that Medford Public Schools no longer acknowledges someone who has perfect attendance when you know that student may have worked really hard and

1285
03:11:24,980 --> 03:11:34,944
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't get sick very easily, and they made it through the year, and their teacher is there encouraging them and saying, wow, you did a great job.

1286
03:11:34,984 --> 03:11:37,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to really be here every day of the school year?

1287
03:11:37,645 --> 03:11:39,666
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are some kids in every classroom.

1288
03:11:40,186 --> 03:11:41,567
[SPEAKER_02]: There might be two or three.

1289
03:11:41,667 --> 03:11:48,010
[SPEAKER_02]: There could be five every year that never miss a day, even when the teacher takes a personal day.

1290
03:11:48,050 --> 03:11:49,090
[SPEAKER_02]: They never miss a day.

1291
03:11:49,910 --> 03:11:53,392
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just wouldn't want to take something where

1292
03:11:55,077 --> 03:12:12,176
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it builds, if you're able to do it, it builds something in you about work ethic, about you're a student, that's your job, come to school every day if you can and do your best, whatever your best may be, and you can acknowledge them and

1293
03:12:14,106 --> 03:12:16,428
[SPEAKER_02]: encourage them and say, you can do it, you can do it.

1294
03:12:16,748 --> 03:12:20,050
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they do get sick, we understand you get sick, you don't come to school.

1295
03:12:20,170 --> 03:12:27,756
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just feel to say that we're never going to recognize kids for perfect attendance anymore.

1296
03:12:27,916 --> 03:12:32,319
[SPEAKER_02]: I just kind of feel like that's going to be quite sad.

1297
03:12:38,503 --> 03:12:40,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam Superintendent.

1298
03:12:40,524 --> 03:12:41,425
[SPEAKER_06]: Member McLaughlin.

1299
03:12:43,287 --> 03:12:43,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1300
03:12:44,047 --> 03:12:49,149
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you to Member Russo and to Superintendent and to my colleagues.

1301
03:12:50,510 --> 03:12:54,871
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually am, you know, as tired as I am, I'm actually really enjoying this conversation.

1302
03:12:54,911 --> 03:13:06,256
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's a nice, healthy conversation to be having, to be listening to other perspectives about sort of even perfectionism and sort of, you know, lack of and all of the all of these other aspects.

1303
03:13:06,316 --> 03:13:08,977
[SPEAKER_07]: And it had me thinking even earlier, and I

1304
03:13:09,637 --> 03:13:15,403
[SPEAKER_07]: didn't speak up then, but this seems like an opportunity to do so now is thinking about, again, the concept of ableism.

1305
03:13:15,464 --> 03:13:30,380
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, you know, so much of what we do as a district is often centered around as well, you know, not just perfect attendance, but, you know, spelling bees and reading contests and poetry contest and, you know, just all sorts of things that people who are fiercely competitive and

1306
03:13:30,760 --> 03:13:50,389
[SPEAKER_07]: all of those things, and I think we really need to be thinking outside of the box about how all of our children are feeling valued and receiving accolades for any number of things, whether it's perfect attendance or, you know, I would love to see the poetry competition be in either another language, I was saying, or, you know, somebody using a

1307
03:13:50,829 --> 03:14:18,035
[SPEAKER_07]: a device who doesn't communicate with words or you know just really thinking outside of the box on how we're doing these things so I think this is important and I don't think it's either or I think it's both and which is something I've been saying a lot of lately I think it's how do we figure out how to make the student who maybe has nothing else but the ability to come into school every single day because that's their safe place and they've been able to do it for 180 years and they really like being there and they get that award and it's the only little

1308
03:14:18,475 --> 03:14:21,296
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, plaque that they have at home and that they're sharing or whatever.

1309
03:14:21,316 --> 03:14:22,917
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's something really substantive to them.

1310
03:14:22,997 --> 03:14:26,058
[SPEAKER_07]: Or maybe it's, you know, we don't know all these different scenarios.

1311
03:14:26,098 --> 03:14:34,901
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think how we are thinking outside the box is really where I want to see our district going and how we're thinking about how are we really valuing every child in these situations.

1312
03:14:34,961 --> 03:14:42,264
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, not just perfect attendance and not just spelling bees or reading contests, like, how can we think about all of the children in these cases.

1313
03:14:42,324 --> 03:14:45,345
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I appreciate Member Rousseau and Superintendent and

1314
03:14:45,983 --> 03:14:47,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and my colleagues for doing that.

1315
03:14:47,904 --> 03:14:49,464
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um, thank you.

1316
03:14:55,546 --> 03:14:56,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there already a second on this?

1317
03:14:59,227 --> 03:15:01,728
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no second on this.

1318
03:15:02,228 --> 03:15:03,549
[SPEAKER_06]: So move the paper.

1319
03:15:03,929 --> 03:15:05,389
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, second.

1320
03:15:08,930 --> 03:15:14,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you restate the motion in our paper?

1321
03:15:15,672 --> 03:15:38,940
[SPEAKER_06]: given that attendance is a required first step in educating our students and given that excessive focus on attendance can lead to ill students and staff coming to school when they are contagious with the potential to harm other students, staff, and families, the attendance policy will be sent to the rules, policy, and equity subcommittee for review and update as needed to ensure that it prohibits awards

1322
03:15:40,265 --> 03:15:45,328
[SPEAKER_06]: or recognitions of any kind being conferred within the Medford Public School for perfect attendance.

1323
03:15:46,729 --> 03:15:50,672
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so the motion is to move it to subcommittee, correct?

1324
03:15:50,872 --> 03:15:51,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1325
03:15:51,933 --> 03:15:52,873
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you.

1326
03:15:53,774 --> 03:16:07,003
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I just amend it to also, I mean, I think there's a middle ground here to maybe set a prohibit just to review the policy and see if we can come up with some middle ground here, I think.

1327
03:16:09,095 --> 03:16:14,038
[SPEAKER_06]: prohibit doesn't send it to subcommittee to discuss it.

1328
03:16:16,060 --> 03:16:20,203
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're also voting with all due respect.

1329
03:16:20,223 --> 03:16:22,504
[SPEAKER_06]: We're also voting to discuss prohibiting it.

1330
03:16:23,185 --> 03:16:25,846
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think I know member Kratz has an issue with that.

1331
03:16:25,987 --> 03:16:34,412
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and I, you know, listened clearly when the superintendent gave her points as well as member Kratz.

1332
03:16:34,432 --> 03:16:36,714
[SPEAKER_06]: So I see that side as well.

1333
03:16:37,651 --> 03:16:40,732
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, member Kretz, the member McLaughlin, the member Rousseau.

1334
03:16:42,512 --> 03:16:42,952
Thank you.

1335
03:16:43,152 --> 03:16:47,753
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, yeah, so I'm opposed to prohibiting perfect attendance.

1336
03:16:48,633 --> 03:17:06,557
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, so if that is the, the resolution to send it to the rules and policy subcommittee so that it can be worked out to remove perfect attendance from the policies in attendance, then, you know, I won't be able to support the resolution as it is written.

1337
03:17:08,562 --> 03:17:14,526
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why, yeah, I was kind of making a motion to amend so that all things can be discussed as it relates to perfect attendance.

1338
03:17:14,586 --> 03:17:16,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Member McLaughlin, then member Russo.

1339
03:17:16,987 --> 03:17:17,708
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, thank you.

1340
03:17:18,388 --> 03:17:22,611
[SPEAKER_07]: I had assumed, I didn't think that it was strictly saying that we were only able to talk about prohibiting.

1341
03:17:22,631 --> 03:17:29,595
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought the discussion was about whether to prohibit, which would then naturally have a discussion of whether not to prohibit.

1342
03:17:29,635 --> 03:17:32,757
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would like- That's not what it does.

1343
03:17:33,912 --> 03:17:40,435
[SPEAKER_06]: So somebody not watching the meeting would believe that if you vote yes, you are voting to prohibit perfect attendance.

1344
03:17:42,076 --> 03:17:42,656
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Russo.

1345
03:17:44,097 --> 03:17:46,238
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1346
03:17:46,858 --> 03:17:52,001
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't really have much interest in having another meeting to discuss whether or not we should do nothing.

1347
03:17:54,121 --> 03:17:56,203
[SPEAKER_11]: anything that's softer than this is to do nothing.

1348
03:17:56,363 --> 03:18:00,366
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that the committee wants to vote it down, they should vote it down.

1349
03:18:00,386 --> 03:18:12,036
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't, the purpose of this is to protect the families and other students of our students from the incenting of students to go to school sick.

1350
03:18:12,196 --> 03:18:13,637
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's just call it what it is.

1351
03:18:14,418 --> 03:18:14,798
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1352
03:18:14,898 --> 03:18:15,199
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I

1353
03:18:15,855 --> 03:18:34,758
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't know how many times in 2019, I had to talk to a parent multiple times because her husband had no immune system because he was on chemo and the students were going to our schools and there were teachers and there were other students who were clearly too ill.

1354
03:18:34,878 --> 03:18:43,080
[SPEAKER_11]: And all you educators, are you telling me you've not been to schools and classrooms where there are clearly sick kids who are just powering through

1355
03:18:43,501 --> 03:18:52,924
[SPEAKER_11]: whether it's because they don't want to be home because it's not safe or because they're hungry or they want a perfect attendance, whatever thousand reasons why kids go to school.

1356
03:18:52,944 --> 03:18:54,065
[SPEAKER_11]: I was one of those kids.

1357
03:18:54,105 --> 03:19:00,567
[SPEAKER_11]: I went to school under, I mean, I didn't have perfect attendance, but school was the only place I got to eat during the school year.

1358
03:19:01,347 --> 03:19:03,348
[SPEAKER_11]: So I went to school because I was hungry.

1359
03:19:03,748 --> 03:19:05,909
[SPEAKER_11]: And if I had been sick, I would have gone to school too.

1360
03:19:05,969 --> 03:19:08,029
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't remember whether I went to school sick or not.

1361
03:19:08,690 --> 03:19:11,591
[SPEAKER_11]: And I did that because what mattered was me.

1362
03:19:13,260 --> 03:19:13,680
[SPEAKER_11]: student.

1363
03:19:15,542 --> 03:19:28,273
[SPEAKER_11]: But the idea that we would add an incentive to pull in kids to school so they could get a piece of paper at the end of the year, even if that meant we might kill another kid's parent.

1364
03:19:29,234 --> 03:19:30,755
[SPEAKER_11]: And I saw the smile on her

1365
03:19:31,317 --> 03:19:32,258
[SPEAKER_11]: Dr. Edward Vincent.

1366
03:19:32,658 --> 03:19:42,363
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, every one of us knew a kid in school who was more proud of the fact that they had perfect attendance than if their parent had been a Nobel laureate.

1367
03:19:42,863 --> 03:19:45,505
[SPEAKER_11]: We all knew those kids and maybe some of us were those kids.

1368
03:19:46,205 --> 03:19:54,470
[SPEAKER_11]: But the pride in getting to school every day is, first of all, is often just a reflection of having a stable home.

1369
03:19:55,445 --> 03:20:02,228
[SPEAKER_11]: of having what you need or maybe not, maybe it's the only safe space, but let's talk about who's not getting to school.

1370
03:20:02,268 --> 03:20:08,791
[SPEAKER_11]: How many kids on IEPs, and maybe we should have a motion for that, how many kids on IEPs have perfect attendance in a school year?

1371
03:20:10,211 --> 03:20:12,652
[SPEAKER_11]: I would bet real money is close to 0%.

1372
03:20:15,733 --> 03:20:21,196
[SPEAKER_11]: So is this really about attendance or is this about rewarding those kids that are lucky already?

1373
03:20:22,356 --> 03:20:24,237
[SPEAKER_11]: And the impact of rewarding them

1374
03:20:24,833 --> 03:20:29,079
[SPEAKER_11]: is that they might get other people sick who then can't come to school themselves.

1375
03:20:30,140 --> 03:20:32,744
[SPEAKER_11]: I just don't see any value in this piece of paper.

1376
03:20:32,784 --> 03:20:34,446
[SPEAKER_11]: By the way, when we get out into the real world,

1377
03:20:35,135 --> 03:20:41,360
[SPEAKER_11]: Not a fricking employer in the world cares that you had perfect attendance in high school or in elementary or middle school.

1378
03:20:41,800 --> 03:20:45,763
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think it's kids loving school and wanting to go to school every day.

1379
03:20:46,144 --> 03:20:46,884
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a goal.

1380
03:20:47,445 --> 03:20:50,847
[SPEAKER_11]: And Dr. Edward Vincent spoke about the fact that she loved school.

1381
03:20:50,907 --> 03:20:51,948
[SPEAKER_11]: She didn't want to miss school.

1382
03:20:52,188 --> 03:20:53,649
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's beautiful.

1383
03:20:53,669 --> 03:20:54,290
[SPEAKER_11]: That's wonderful.

1384
03:20:54,310 --> 03:20:55,971
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's what we should, all the kids should have.

1385
03:20:56,992 --> 03:21:03,197
[SPEAKER_11]: But incenting somebody to come, if you were a senior in high school and had never missed a single day of school,

1386
03:21:05,227 --> 03:21:06,668
[SPEAKER_11]: And then you came down with the flu.

1387
03:21:06,888 --> 03:21:09,049
[SPEAKER_11]: You'd have dragged your ass to school and you know it.

1388
03:21:12,031 --> 03:21:13,711
[SPEAKER_11]: We all know that's what would have happened.

1389
03:21:13,852 --> 03:21:25,377
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that we should just vote this down and say, I'm sorry to the parents who might get flu from their kid at school and just,

1390
03:21:26,732 --> 03:21:27,633
[SPEAKER_11]: just that's what it is.

1391
03:21:27,673 --> 03:21:31,976
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't wanna go to subcommittee to talk about whether we're not going to do something.

1392
03:21:31,996 --> 03:21:42,724
[SPEAKER_11]: Either we are going to agree that we think that this shouldn't be rewarded, this behavior that we are instilling, or we have lots of other work to do, we don't need to do this.

1393
03:21:45,126 --> 03:21:52,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, we have member Stone, member McLaughlin, and Dr. Edward Vincent, and then member Van de Kloot.

1394
03:21:54,193 --> 03:21:54,773
[SPEAKER_14]: I was gonna say,

1395
03:21:56,982 --> 03:22:01,533
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been to four high school graduations since coming on the committee.

1396
03:22:02,098 --> 03:22:04,799
[SPEAKER_14]: And I believe it's only one time that a student was recognized.

1397
03:22:04,839 --> 03:22:13,101
[SPEAKER_14]: And I have to say, I was more impressed with that student than the other awards given, because I don't think it's a matter of kids being sick.

1398
03:22:13,421 --> 03:22:18,282
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I think I would say 99%, when my kids stay home, they're not sick.

1399
03:22:18,742 --> 03:22:20,343
[SPEAKER_14]: They just want to have a day to stay home.

1400
03:22:20,943 --> 03:22:24,924
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't think we can assume that kids are sick who are perfect attendants.

1401
03:22:25,524 --> 03:22:28,525
[SPEAKER_14]: And I do think it's something that the community

1402
03:22:29,465 --> 03:22:31,706
[SPEAKER_14]: respects of these students, their dedication.

1403
03:22:31,726 --> 03:22:34,088
[SPEAKER_14]: I hear everything you're saying, Paul.

1404
03:22:34,488 --> 03:22:42,713
[SPEAKER_14]: But I do think we need to hear from the parents of the students, because we're not hearing everyone's voice about this.

1405
03:22:42,793 --> 03:22:48,416
[SPEAKER_14]: We're hearing, I think, a lot of the cons of it, I guess.

1406
03:22:48,516 --> 03:22:51,398
[SPEAKER_14]: And I mean, I've only seen it once in four years.

1407
03:22:51,458 --> 03:22:54,800
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't think kids are struggling through the flu to make it to school.

1408
03:22:54,820 --> 03:22:57,521
[SPEAKER_14]: I think between just having

1409
03:22:59,613 --> 03:23:04,998
[SPEAKER_14]: good, I guess, good immune system and a good dedication to school that they're there.

1410
03:23:05,018 --> 03:23:08,942
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that it was really something commendable.

1411
03:23:08,962 --> 03:23:21,956
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the high school community really thought that student was deserving of it because I just, for my own kids, I know that 99% of the time they're not going to school because they're sick.

1412
03:23:22,596 --> 03:23:34,044
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, and so I think I am with the mayor with, I think a conversation is still an important thing with the whole community at the rules and regulations about it so we can hear from other parents.

1413
03:23:36,466 --> 03:23:37,566
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Member Stone.

1414
03:23:37,606 --> 03:23:38,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Member McLaughlin.

1415
03:23:40,872 --> 03:23:41,392
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1416
03:23:41,952 --> 03:23:44,914
[SPEAKER_07]: It's good to hear from all our colleagues.

1417
03:23:46,174 --> 03:24:01,621
[SPEAKER_07]: I would add, you know, that also I don't think that we can assume that, you know, there's a couple of assumptions I feel like are being stated that I'm not sure that I would assume that, you know, kids who have perfect attendance are lucky already.

1418
03:24:01,681 --> 03:24:08,084
[SPEAKER_07]: As I said, I think I certainly knew kids who it was their safe space and that's where they went and they certainly weren't lucky.

1419
03:24:09,865 --> 03:24:22,389
[SPEAKER_07]: And I also don't think we can assume that all privileged, you know, people have perfect attendance or that not having perfect attendance award is going to stop people who are sick from coming to school.

1420
03:24:22,489 --> 03:24:33,713
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I think a lot of these sort of conclusions, I'm not really understanding, which I think is another reason to have a conversation where I can understand better and we can have a healthy conversation.

1421
03:24:33,753 --> 03:24:35,734
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think referring something to subcommittee

1422
03:24:36,262 --> 03:24:38,063
[SPEAKER_07]: means that we're talking about doing nothing.

1423
03:24:38,103 --> 03:24:43,386
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it means that we're exploring conversations and different opinions and really trying to understand each other's opinions.

1424
03:24:44,026 --> 03:25:00,715
[SPEAKER_07]: And to the point regarding IEPs, Mayor, I would say, I would agree that probably a lot of students on IEPs do not have perfect attendance, which is again, another reason for my discussion earlier around ableism and what kind of awards are we offering for children with IEPs.

1425
03:25:02,196 --> 03:25:03,997
[SPEAKER_07]: And not having perfect attendance,

1426
03:25:05,438 --> 03:25:08,440
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, would not stop kids who are sick from coming to school I think.

1427
03:25:09,261 --> 03:25:22,370
[SPEAKER_07]: And also I don't think that it's a zero sum game I don't think that by saying a child who's coming into school with perfect attendance is thereby risking the death of an adult or a child in our school I think that's a really.

1428
03:25:24,131 --> 03:25:28,614
[SPEAKER_07]: dramatic statement and one that I would like to explore more in subcommittee.

1429
03:25:28,674 --> 03:25:35,278
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would support moving this to subcommittee for a further healthy discussion with community members and colleagues.

1430
03:25:36,839 --> 03:25:47,586
[SPEAKER_07]: But I would not be able to support not having a discussion, a healthy discussion, to review as a whole, not just one side of the argument.

1431
03:25:47,666 --> 03:25:48,386
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you.

1432
03:25:50,348 --> 03:25:50,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1433
03:25:50,828 --> 03:25:52,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Edward Vincent and Member Van de Kloot.

1434
03:25:54,300 --> 03:26:06,374
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel that the other members who spoke were just presenting similar thoughts that I was going to say, so I will pass.

1435
03:26:06,615 --> 03:26:06,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1436
03:26:07,456 --> 03:26:08,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1437
03:26:08,457 --> 03:26:09,097
[SPEAKER_06]: Member van de Kloot.

1438
03:26:09,747 --> 03:26:15,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, so member Rousseau, I'm a little torn here because I can actually see both sides.

1439
03:26:16,991 --> 03:26:23,675
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I don't think that you're correct in saying there's, we're only gonna send it to subcommittee if I'm going to get my way.

1440
03:26:24,556 --> 03:26:34,161
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole point of a subcommittee discussion should be an opportunity to get more input, not only from perhaps parents, but also from our educators.

1441
03:26:35,002 --> 03:26:36,343
[SPEAKER_03]: The high school graduation has been

1442
03:26:37,263 --> 03:26:50,633
[SPEAKER_03]: mentioned multiple times and you know I used to have a really hard time with it because I was like, Jesus, there's a lot of kids in this audience who, you know, they got the flu or they broke their arm or something happened and they couldn't go to school and now.

1443
03:26:51,754 --> 03:26:53,675
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, again, maybe they're

1444
03:26:54,796 --> 03:27:10,617
[SPEAKER_03]: They're finding satisfaction in some other ways, and there may have been kids and I certainly remember, I mean one year there was a year where there was only one kid, but one year there was like five or six and it was amazing that all those kids had really been able to go.

1445
03:27:12,519 --> 03:27:30,432
[SPEAKER_03]: It is called out at the high school, and it's always by the audience really appreciated and I've always felt kind of funny because I do feel kind of funny about it because I share your concerns about does it does it motivate kids but you know I never knew we gave that award until I went to the high school graduation.

1446
03:27:31,752 --> 03:27:33,614
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know how many kids know.

1447
03:27:34,494 --> 03:27:41,739
[SPEAKER_03]: My kids never talked about it and said, oh boy, I'm not going to get the perfect attendance award because they never, you know, it just wasn't part of their thinking.

1448
03:27:42,440 --> 03:27:48,464
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, so I totally supported going to subcommittee for the purposes of discussion and input.

1449
03:27:48,644 --> 03:27:54,127
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that, you know, part of it is to be open-minded and listen to other people.

1450
03:27:55,008 --> 03:27:57,890
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what I would be wanting to do.

1451
03:28:00,578 --> 03:28:01,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Member Van de Kloot.

1452
03:28:01,918 --> 03:28:02,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Russo.

1453
03:28:04,019 --> 03:28:04,459
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1454
03:28:05,199 --> 03:28:06,879
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate the conversation.

1455
03:28:07,119 --> 03:28:23,663
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to make an amendment to my motion to change the language where it says to review and update as needed to ensure that it prohibits awards or recognitions.

1456
03:28:23,743 --> 03:28:27,584
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to change that to review and update as needed

1457
03:28:31,060 --> 03:28:41,083
[SPEAKER_11]: award, just get rid of the to ensure that it prohibits to just say update as needed awards and recognitions.

1458
03:28:43,244 --> 03:28:46,405
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, within mother member public schools for perfect attendance.

1459
03:28:47,685 --> 03:28:59,449
[SPEAKER_11]: And then in addition, I would add the language that the superintendent will provide three years of data on perfect attendance for K to 12

1460
03:29:01,149 --> 03:29:09,075
[SPEAKER_11]: and it will be disambiguated by the DESI special categories, not including this year.

1461
03:29:10,176 --> 03:29:13,238
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think this year is particularly meaningful for attendance.

1462
03:29:18,162 --> 03:29:22,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion for approval by member Russo, seconded by member Graham still.

1463
03:29:24,326 --> 03:29:24,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call.

1464
03:29:28,549 --> 03:29:29,050
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Graham.

1465
03:29:29,789 --> 03:29:29,929
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1466
03:29:29,949 --> 03:29:30,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1467
03:29:30,770 --> 03:29:31,330
[SPEAKER_07]: Number cracks.

1468
03:29:34,533 --> 03:29:34,733
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1469
03:29:36,394 --> 03:29:37,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Number McLaughlin.

1470
03:29:37,255 --> 03:29:37,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1471
03:29:38,316 --> 03:29:39,216
[SPEAKER_07]: Member of my stone.

1472
03:29:39,657 --> 03:29:39,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1473
03:29:40,998 --> 03:29:42,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Rousseau.

1474
03:29:43,360 --> 03:29:43,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1475
03:29:44,200 --> 03:29:45,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Number Van de Kloot.

1476
03:29:45,421 --> 03:29:45,661
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1477
03:29:47,002 --> 03:29:47,563
[SPEAKER_07]: Mayor logo.

1478
03:29:47,583 --> 03:29:49,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Kern Yes, seven.

1479
03:29:49,424 --> 03:29:50,325
[SPEAKER_06]: The affirmative

1480
03:30:02,357 --> 03:30:10,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Number two, the Rules Policy and Equity Subcommittee shall draft a new policy on field trips that includes the following.

1481
03:30:11,159 --> 03:30:21,360
[SPEAKER_06]: The superintendent or designee will provide a report to this committee no later than 30 days after the completion of every field trip or at the next school committee meeting, whichever is later.

1482
03:30:21,800 --> 03:30:31,102
[SPEAKER_06]: The report will include the number of students that participated, the number of students that were eligible to participate, and the breakdown of selected populations per DESE categories

1483
03:30:31,627 --> 03:30:39,154
[SPEAKER_06]: for each of these groups, those that participated and those that did not, for any field trip that did not include eligible students.

1484
03:30:39,994 --> 03:30:41,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Offered by member Russo.

1485
03:30:42,577 --> 03:30:42,997
[SPEAKER_07]: Second.

1486
03:30:43,037 --> 03:30:43,658
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, mayor.

1487
03:30:44,458 --> 03:30:44,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1488
03:30:45,159 --> 03:30:46,240
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm tired, sorry.

1489
03:30:46,280 --> 03:30:46,740
[SPEAKER_11]: That's okay.

1490
03:30:47,781 --> 03:30:50,644
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to quickly give a very, very brief background on this.

1491
03:30:51,084 --> 03:30:55,208
[SPEAKER_11]: So that last sentence I think is particularly confusing as I read it.

1492
03:30:56,003 --> 03:30:58,524
[SPEAKER_11]: even though I wrote it and read it many times before I submitted it.

1493
03:31:01,124 --> 03:31:16,948
[SPEAKER_11]: For any field trip that did not include all eligible students, what I mean there is, if the third grade all left and went to the Royal House, they all went, then we don't need this report.

1494
03:31:18,208 --> 03:31:25,090
[SPEAKER_11]: But if the French club goes to France, every eligible student is every person who's enrolled

1495
03:31:25,720 --> 03:31:28,841
[SPEAKER_11]: the French club, and we would need this report.

1496
03:31:29,821 --> 03:31:41,204
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't, this says the superintendent or her designee, and of course, my assumption is the superintendent will actually have a form and the people doing the field trip will fill it out.

1497
03:31:42,004 --> 03:31:43,664
[SPEAKER_11]: That will probably have to go to Ms.

1498
03:31:43,764 --> 03:31:53,687
[SPEAKER_11]: Miles, who will be able to pull out data that says, all right, here's the categories for the students that went, here's the categories for the students that could have gone,

1499
03:31:55,005 --> 03:32:05,411
[SPEAKER_11]: because we really need to get a much more clearer picture of what I think many of us sort of at a gut level understand and know who goes on field trips and who doesn't.

1500
03:32:06,312 --> 03:32:19,299
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think that the data is absolutely necessary to be able to have a conversation with the community about funding all of these things through the tax base rather than through just the lucky families that can afford all this stuff.

1501
03:32:19,339 --> 03:32:19,919
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's the,

1502
03:32:21,287 --> 03:32:22,287
[SPEAKER_11]: purpose of this.

1503
03:32:22,487 --> 03:32:37,191
[SPEAKER_11]: And I recognize that it is not a, you know, it's not a two minute activity and it is not super lightweight, but the students that are not receiving a free public education deserve to receive one.

1504
03:32:37,511 --> 03:32:39,211
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think this is how we can get us there.

1505
03:32:39,771 --> 03:32:40,131
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1506
03:32:40,671 --> 03:32:41,031
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1507
03:32:41,311 --> 03:32:43,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Member McLaughlin and Dr. Edward Vincent.

1508
03:32:44,743 --> 03:32:45,544
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, thank you.

1509
03:32:46,004 --> 03:33:01,240
[SPEAKER_07]: This is something that's been an issue that I've been concerned with for some time and I just want to thank members so for bringing it forward but also want to ensure, for example, the example, the example that was used a moment ago that you know when you say if it's a field trip for third graders.

1510
03:33:01,680 --> 03:33:04,163
[SPEAKER_07]: and all third graders go, you don't need to disaggregate the data.

1511
03:33:04,183 --> 03:33:18,576
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to have a qualifier on that to say, you know, that we are being inclusive, of course, with regards to accessibility, so that this means all classrooms, all students, if every student in the third grade, you know, had gone, then that's one thing.

1512
03:33:18,636 --> 03:33:25,383
[SPEAKER_07]: But if there's any subset of the students that aren't going, that we know that and, and, and, you know, what, if any reason,

1513
03:33:25,863 --> 03:33:26,263
[SPEAKER_07]: there might be.

1514
03:33:26,323 --> 03:33:30,386
[SPEAKER_07]: So just the disaggregation part is of particular importance to me.

1515
03:33:30,446 --> 03:33:35,649
[SPEAKER_07]: So I want to make sure that we say disaggregation by subgroups or something to that effect, if you don't mind.

1516
03:33:36,950 --> 03:33:37,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1517
03:33:37,951 --> 03:33:38,271
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1518
03:33:38,371 --> 03:33:39,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Great point, Member McLaughlin.

1519
03:33:40,132 --> 03:33:42,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Edwarda Vincent, then Dr. Cushing.

1520
03:33:42,394 --> 03:33:52,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so I just, for clarification purposes, when I read that particular resolution, I was thinking about it from the lens of

1521
03:33:54,008 --> 03:33:58,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Were you asking if students were being excluded for whatever reason?

1522
03:33:59,112 --> 03:34:19,028
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, if it's something about the major field trips, like the New York trip that the middle schoolers normally would go on, or traveling overseas, because I just was thinking the practicality of adding a presentation after every single field trip that would end up

1523
03:34:20,303 --> 03:34:26,466
[SPEAKER_02]: being a significant amount of additional school committee reports.

1524
03:34:26,526 --> 03:34:44,493
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're saying like a major trip that requires either a significant amount of money that students might not be able to participate in, I'm just trying to make sure I'm properly understanding the resolution as you intended, Member Russo.

1525
03:34:45,634 --> 03:34:46,754
[SPEAKER_11]: May I respond?

1526
03:34:47,034 --> 03:34:47,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1527
03:34:49,532 --> 03:34:55,073
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we can dig into the graphic details in the meeting and the subcommittee, because this just sends it to the subcommittee.

1528
03:34:55,093 --> 03:35:00,515
[SPEAKER_11]: But I will just say that I certainly don't think it is just the big ones.

1529
03:35:00,575 --> 03:35:04,675
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the small ones matter very much too to the students that didn't get to go.

1530
03:35:04,695 --> 03:35:11,637
[SPEAKER_11]: And the students may not be going for simple matters of, we didn't translate a permission slip or something.

1531
03:35:11,937 --> 03:35:15,978
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, but finding those situations and closing the gap

1532
03:35:16,942 --> 03:35:18,283
[SPEAKER_11]: affects those students directly.

1533
03:35:18,323 --> 03:35:22,224
[SPEAKER_11]: But as for whether, I would never expect a presentation.

1534
03:35:22,324 --> 03:35:27,287
[SPEAKER_11]: And frankly, I think that this would just go on the agenda as a report for your information.

1535
03:35:27,307 --> 03:35:31,088
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't expect this to become part of our agenda per se.

1536
03:35:32,329 --> 03:35:45,315
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think if we get a report one week and it shows that 12% of eligible students went and we look at the disaggregation and we go, whoa, something's totally wrong here.

1537
03:35:45,983 --> 03:35:53,746
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, we may want to make it a conversation at another meeting, but I don't, I don't envision that this is like, you know, there are lots of field trips in a normal year.

1538
03:35:53,766 --> 03:35:58,547
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't, I don't envision us having conversations on a regular basis.

1539
03:35:58,847 --> 03:36:14,613
[SPEAKER_11]: I would think once a year, we would want to sit down and really put the data together and figure out how to say to the community in a, in a, in a loud data-driven voice that says, no, we don't have the resources we need to give our kids a fair

1540
03:36:15,374 --> 03:36:18,456
[SPEAKER_11]: a free public education, and this is what it means.

1541
03:36:18,516 --> 03:36:20,518
[SPEAKER_11]: This is what it's actually meaning to the students.

1542
03:36:20,678 --> 03:36:39,750
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think having that data is the only way to say that other than sounding like I'm being hyperbolic or I'm being too radical or any other kind of thing that if we have hard data that is just numbers, I think that is incredibly important.

1543
03:36:39,930 --> 03:36:43,773
[SPEAKER_11]: And I hope, of course, that we don't have to do this for all eternity.

1544
03:36:44,900 --> 03:36:47,060
[SPEAKER_11]: The goal is that this becomes not an issue.

1545
03:36:48,061 --> 03:36:49,281
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you.

1546
03:36:51,921 --> 03:36:54,322
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Cushing, did you still want to?

1547
03:36:54,342 --> 03:36:54,522
[SPEAKER_13]: I did.

1548
03:36:54,582 --> 03:36:56,762
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll save my concerns for the subcommittee.

1549
03:36:58,382 --> 03:37:00,023
[SPEAKER_06]: I just have one example too.

1550
03:37:00,563 --> 03:37:10,605
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember at least a year ago, my daughter went on a field trip and it was $35 to go to a play through, I think, the McGlynn Middle School.

1551
03:37:10,665 --> 03:37:12,205
[SPEAKER_06]: And I remember asking her,

1552
03:37:13,359 --> 03:37:14,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Did everybody go?

1553
03:37:14,300 --> 03:37:16,222
[SPEAKER_06]: Could everybody afford the ticket?

1554
03:37:16,703 --> 03:37:19,886
[SPEAKER_06]: And she said, yeah, I think almost everybody went.

1555
03:37:19,926 --> 03:37:22,089
[SPEAKER_06]: There was some boys that didn't want to go.

1556
03:37:22,129 --> 03:37:25,373
[SPEAKER_06]: And in my head thinking, I hope they really didn't want to go.

1557
03:37:25,433 --> 03:37:28,056
[SPEAKER_06]: And it wasn't just that they couldn't afford it.

1558
03:37:29,228 --> 03:37:44,597
[SPEAKER_06]: some of the France and New York trips, you want that data too, but you also want the data on like the $35 ticket where, so if it's $2 to go to the zoo or $0 to go to the zoo, it's a lot different than a $35 ticket that some families might not be able to afford.

1559
03:37:44,677 --> 03:37:52,101
[SPEAKER_06]: So hopefully we can have the teachers know about this plan to get the data so it's a little less

1560
03:37:52,721 --> 03:38:01,531
[SPEAKER_06]: work on the admin and we can just kind of collect it and have it emailed to us or put on the agenda as an update, quick update.

1561
03:38:01,671 --> 03:38:03,513
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's good value here.

1562
03:38:04,715 --> 03:38:08,459
[SPEAKER_06]: So motion for approval as amended by Member McLaughlin.

1563
03:38:09,460 --> 03:38:10,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Kratz has her hand up.

1564
03:38:10,821 --> 03:38:12,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, Member Kratz, I didn't see you.

1565
03:38:13,656 --> 03:38:13,796
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep.

1566
03:38:13,956 --> 03:38:16,217
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just wanted to know and just to clarify.

1567
03:38:16,317 --> 03:38:29,123
[SPEAKER_15]: So this resolution is to send it to the rules and equity policy subcommittee to work out the details about the reports, because I'm just thinking that is this going to take.

1568
03:38:29,703 --> 03:38:54,422
[SPEAKER_15]: a lot of, you know, extra work on the administrative side, getting those reports ready, or are those reports going to be easily, you know, kind of, you know, extracted via a data, you know, extract, or I'm just not sure how this, because it seems like every field trip to get all that data in all those reports, you know.

1569
03:38:58,753 --> 03:39:02,175
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Russo, then Member McLaughlin.

1570
03:39:03,155 --> 03:39:03,736
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1571
03:39:04,016 --> 03:39:13,060
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I think we'll work that out in the subcommittee, member Kratz, because I think that is very, very important and why I didn't just come forward with the resolution.

1572
03:39:13,120 --> 03:39:19,684
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's why I sent it to the subcommittee, because we need to understand our data system capabilities.

1573
03:39:19,884 --> 03:39:25,747
[SPEAKER_11]: The recommendation that may come out of the subcommittee is that it's just impossible with our current data systems.

1574
03:39:26,007 --> 03:39:27,948
[SPEAKER_11]: And I do consider that a possibility.

1575
03:39:28,666 --> 03:39:38,831
[SPEAKER_11]: really hope it's not the answer, but I fully hold that as an actual possibility that we actually can't do it.

1576
03:39:39,192 --> 03:39:48,056
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope we can, but we will work those out and make sure we have all the right people in the subcommittee meeting to understand, you know, the workflow for,

1577
03:39:50,513 --> 03:39:54,216
[SPEAKER_11]: for field trips also needs to really, you know, there's not one workflow.

1578
03:39:54,276 --> 03:39:55,798
[SPEAKER_11]: We have workflows for out of state.

1579
03:39:55,918 --> 03:39:58,460
[SPEAKER_11]: We have workflows for in state.

1580
03:39:58,780 --> 03:40:02,443
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, you know, there may be workflows that are outside of the normal workflows.

1581
03:40:02,683 --> 03:40:06,266
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, we'll work that out.

1582
03:40:06,346 --> 03:40:08,809
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't envision this to be a 20 minute meeting for sure.

1583
03:40:13,092 --> 03:40:13,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin.

1584
03:40:14,830 --> 03:40:32,119
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I just was going to second member Rousseau's comment for member credits that I think that, you know, again, it's another issue of putting systems in place and having it, you know, be an hopefully easily done task with a with a, you know, pre created form.

1585
03:40:33,100 --> 03:40:35,121
[SPEAKER_07]: So we will definitely be discussing those things.

1586
03:40:35,141 --> 03:40:42,345
[SPEAKER_07]: We certainly don't want to give more work to folks, we really just want to be able to disaggregate the data and make sure that everybody's having an equal opportunity.

1587
03:40:46,875 --> 03:40:56,028
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, in a way that our principals can collect the data efficiently and have enough time to do it.

1588
03:40:56,809 --> 03:40:58,211
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a motion on the floor.

1589
03:40:58,231 --> 03:41:01,295
[SPEAKER_07]: Mayor, Member Graham has her hand up.

1590
03:41:01,776 --> 03:41:02,457
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, sorry, okay.

1591
03:41:02,677 --> 03:41:03,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham.

1592
03:41:04,154 --> 03:41:24,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Just as a point of information, at the beginning of the pandemic, when we were having issues around canceling field trips, we referred something to the rules policy and equity subcommittee to revisit how we procure insurance for large field trips, and whether

1593
03:41:25,179 --> 03:41:32,583
[SPEAKER_04]: those practices are in alignment with what we would want to see in these circumstances where we've had we had to pursue refunds.

1594
03:41:32,643 --> 03:41:39,467
[SPEAKER_04]: So you remember we had to get attorney Greenspan to engage and you know get students money back.

1595
03:41:40,687 --> 03:41:54,355
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just wanted to make a reminder that that it was out in the ether and that perhaps if we're going to talk about field trips we can dedicate a meeting to that and that can also resurface.

1596
03:41:55,135 --> 03:41:56,836
[SPEAKER_04]: as an important conversation.

1597
03:41:58,797 --> 03:41:59,137
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1598
03:41:59,197 --> 03:42:01,058
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll add that to my list.

1599
03:42:01,098 --> 03:42:02,319
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think I had it on my list.

1600
03:42:03,980 --> 03:42:04,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.

1601
03:42:07,021 --> 03:42:10,863

[SPEAKER_06]: Medford Public Schools is committed to accessibility and inclusion for all.

1619

03:42:59,327 --> 03:42:59,787
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1621
03:43:00,488 --> 03:43:09,631
[SPEAKER_07]: I just think it's important that we have accessibility, first and foremost, both for the obvious reasons and for the symbolic reasons.

1622
03:43:09,831 --> 03:43:12,872
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I put this motion forward in that vein.
