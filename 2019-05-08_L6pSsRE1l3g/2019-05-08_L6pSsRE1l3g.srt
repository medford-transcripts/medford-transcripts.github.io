[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you to all the families that are out there supporting these young minds.

176
00:28:11,312 --> 00:28:14,552
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, our kids are amazing, and we're proud of them every single day.

177
00:28:15,073 --> 00:28:16,793
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is just really a special night for us.

178
00:28:16,813 --> 00:28:18,113
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you for being a part of it.

179
00:28:18,133 --> 00:28:18,333
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

180
00:28:18,353 --> 00:28:18,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

181
00:28:25,835 --> 00:28:31,396
[SPEAKER_00]: Mayor Burke, I also, and members of the school committee, I forgot to thank Mr. DeLeva as well for his support of Model United Nations.

182
00:28:31,416 --> 00:28:32,517
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to leave him out.

183
00:28:32,597 --> 00:28:34,117
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a special thank you to him too.

184
00:28:38,254 --> 00:28:38,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

185
00:28:38,734 --> 00:28:39,515
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

186
00:28:41,376 --> 00:28:42,556
[SPEAKER_06]: While we're under suspension, Ms.

187
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:44,957
[SPEAKER_06]: Van der Kloot, you'd like to take paper number five?

188
00:28:46,038 --> 00:28:52,381
[SPEAKER_06]: Recognition of Christine Hingston, recipient of Matsell's Teacher of the Year Award.

189
00:28:52,821 --> 00:28:53,121
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

190
00:28:53,401 --> 00:28:54,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Hingston.

191
00:29:02,166 --> 00:29:03,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Downs, he's here.

192
00:29:05,587 --> 00:29:06,048
[SPEAKER_13]: He was here.

193
00:29:06,248 --> 00:29:06,708
[SPEAKER_13]: One second.

194
00:29:08,041 --> 00:29:11,242
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Tixera isn't here right now, so I'm going to do the report for him.

195
00:29:12,643 --> 00:29:13,623
[SPEAKER_13]: Congratulations.

196
00:29:13,743 --> 00:29:14,803
[SPEAKER_13]: Christine, come on up.

197
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:30,608
[SPEAKER_13]: Congratulations to Christine Hingston on receiving Matzol's Teacher of the Year Award.

198
00:29:31,349 --> 00:29:36,793
[SPEAKER_13]: She was nominated for this award by her colleagues at the Roberts, and it is well deserved.

199
00:29:37,133 --> 00:29:38,534
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think they're all here tonight.

200
00:29:38,554 --> 00:29:39,495
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Roberts.

201
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:47,620
[SPEAKER_13]: As well as the principal, Mr. Kirk Johnson.

202
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,181
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Kirk.

203
00:29:51,243 --> 00:29:56,326
[SPEAKER_13]: The Matzahl Nomination Committee then shows the recipient based on the following criteria.

204
00:29:56,946 --> 00:30:07,972
[SPEAKER_13]: Successful teaching of English learners as shown through evidence of best instructional practices and incorporation of students' linguistic and cultural backgrounds within the classroom.

205
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:12,075
[SPEAKER_13]: Long-term commitment to the education of ELs.

206
00:30:12,975 --> 00:30:19,039
[SPEAKER_13]: Leadership roles at the school, district, and or state level on behalf of English language learners.

207
00:30:20,239 --> 00:30:33,771
[SPEAKER_13]: mentoring and supporting of new teachers to the field through both informal and formal induction programs, strong relationships with the community, and for the K-12 parents of ELs.

208
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:34,992
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

209
00:30:35,032 --> 00:30:46,803
[SPEAKER_13]: Hingston consistently demonstrates all of these attributes to the highest degree, and she serves as an exemplary role model to her colleagues at the Roberts and throughout the district.

210
00:30:47,483 --> 00:30:52,004
[SPEAKER_13]: This honor is awarded to one teacher across the state per year, and Ms.

211
00:30:52,024 --> 00:30:55,886
[SPEAKER_13]: Hingston is the second Medford teacher to receive this award.

212
00:30:56,526 --> 00:31:03,428
[SPEAKER_13]: As you may remember, Teresa Castagnetti at the McGlynn Elementary School received Matzol's Teacher of the Year in 2015.

213
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:09,790
[SPEAKER_13]: The award ceremony is part of the Matzol Conference and will be held on Thursday, May 30, 2019.

214
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:10,770
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is an amazing honor.

215
00:31:20,696 --> 00:31:43,091
[SPEAKER_19]: Basically, I'd like to thank the teachers

216
00:31:48,464 --> 00:31:50,505
[SPEAKER_19]: at the Roberts School for supporting me.

217
00:31:51,366 --> 00:31:53,848
[SPEAKER_19]: All of them are equally deserving of this award.

218
00:31:53,908 --> 00:31:58,611
[SPEAKER_19]: And I can't believe that they were able to find the time to put together all this evidence.

219
00:32:01,072 --> 00:32:02,853
[SPEAKER_19]: Not for themselves, but for someone else.

220
00:32:02,974 --> 00:32:05,515
[SPEAKER_19]: It just shows what kind of people are at the Roberts School.

221
00:32:05,575 --> 00:32:08,157
[SPEAKER_19]: And for Mr. Johnson, for all of his support as well.

222
00:32:08,637 --> 00:32:09,618
[SPEAKER_19]: So just thank you.

223
00:32:36,007 --> 00:32:36,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Very nice.

224
00:32:37,848 --> 00:32:38,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Quite an accomplishment.

225
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:44,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, is there a motion on the floor to revert to the regular order of business by Ms.

226
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:44,910
[SPEAKER_06]: Van der Kloot?

227
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a second by Mr. Rousseau?

228
00:32:46,971 --> 00:32:47,571
[SPEAKER_06]: All in favor?

229
00:32:48,272 --> 00:32:48,772
[SPEAKER_06]: All opposed?

230
00:32:49,625 --> 00:32:51,506
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, report of committees.

231
00:32:54,207 --> 00:32:55,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Community participation.

232
00:32:55,648 --> 00:32:57,289
[SPEAKER_06]: We do have a paper.

233
00:33:05,133 --> 00:33:06,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Maureen Ronain.

234
00:33:06,174 --> 00:33:06,214
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

235
00:33:10,676 --> 00:33:11,116
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening.

236
00:33:11,276 --> 00:33:11,756
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening.

237
00:33:11,997 --> 00:33:16,039
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for inviting me here tonight to discuss our experiences with dyslexia.

238
00:33:16,479 --> 00:33:18,680
[SPEAKER_01]: I also wanted to thank Decoding Dyslexia

239
00:33:19,181 --> 00:33:20,801
[SPEAKER_01]: for helping me on parts of the speech.

240
00:33:21,342 --> 00:33:24,823
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Maureen Ronain, and I have a second grader in the district.

241
00:33:25,263 --> 00:33:29,244
[SPEAKER_01]: He is the one in five that has been diagnosed with dyslexia.

242
00:33:29,644 --> 00:33:35,926
[SPEAKER_01]: He is a happy and bright child that does not have the natural ability to read, write, or spell.

243
00:33:36,526 --> 00:33:44,268
[SPEAKER_01]: Children with dyslexia require explicit, systematic, repetitive, and cumulative instruction on how to read.

244
00:33:44,808 --> 00:33:46,429
[SPEAKER_01]: He has been receiving Wilson,

245
00:33:47,069 --> 00:33:49,931
[SPEAKER_01]: for reading since kindergarten on his IEP.

246
00:33:51,372 --> 00:34:00,598
[SPEAKER_01]: So for two and a half years, he met with a special education teacher for up to nine sessions a week for reading support.

247
00:34:00,958 --> 00:34:10,064
[SPEAKER_01]: Each session was 45 minutes long, and to fit all of this instruction in, he sacrificed social studies and science classes, his favorite subjects.

248
00:34:11,045 --> 00:34:15,048
[SPEAKER_01]: At his three-year reevaluation, the district saw incredible progress.

249
00:34:16,141 --> 00:34:19,404
[SPEAKER_01]: For reading fake words, he scored in the 73rd percentile.

250
00:34:19,885 --> 00:34:22,888
[SPEAKER_01]: His written language was scored in the 86th percentile.

251
00:34:23,549 --> 00:34:26,131
[SPEAKER_01]: No further decoding lessons were proposed.

252
00:34:26,732 --> 00:34:31,417
[SPEAKER_01]: He was described as being bored in these lessons, as it was too easy for him.

253
00:34:32,618 --> 00:34:35,581
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, we were not seeing this improvement at home.

254
00:34:36,462 --> 00:34:39,425
[SPEAKER_01]: To allow us additional time to obtain independent testing,

255
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:41,070
[SPEAKER_01]: we invoked a stay put.

256
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:45,411
[SPEAKER_01]: This meant his level of services could not be eliminated at that time.

257
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:52,073
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Cindy Krug from Tufts University administered several standardized reading assessments.

258
00:34:52,713 --> 00:34:56,995
[SPEAKER_01]: She found that he was two years behind his age meets for reading.

259
00:34:57,655 --> 00:35:01,776
[SPEAKER_01]: We had his annual speech and language evaluation at Boston Children's Hospital.

260
00:35:02,236 --> 00:35:03,476
[SPEAKER_01]: They administered the CTOP.

261
00:35:03,616 --> 00:35:06,337
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a comprehensive test of phonological processing.

262
00:35:06,874 --> 00:35:09,476
[SPEAKER_01]: This measures the very basic skills needed for reading.

263
00:35:10,077 --> 00:35:13,079
[SPEAKER_01]: On one subtest, he scored in the one percentile.

264
00:35:13,659 --> 00:35:16,221
[SPEAKER_01]: The scores on the other subtests weren't much better.

265
00:35:17,322 --> 00:35:19,024
[SPEAKER_01]: His written language was reassessed.

266
00:35:19,544 --> 00:35:21,686
[SPEAKER_01]: It was determined to be difficult and laborious.

267
00:35:22,206 --> 00:35:25,288
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of it could not be scored because he could not complete the tasks.

268
00:35:26,269 --> 00:35:30,653
[SPEAKER_01]: On one final measure, he again was tested on his ability to code pseudowords.

269
00:35:31,213 --> 00:35:33,475
[SPEAKER_01]: This determines if a child can actually read

270
00:35:34,287 --> 00:35:35,871
[SPEAKER_01]: or if he has memorized words.

271
00:35:36,432 --> 00:35:39,900
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of 60 fake words, he scored a zero.

272
00:35:41,043 --> 00:35:43,068
[SPEAKER_01]: There is something very wrong here.

273
00:35:44,062 --> 00:35:46,943
[SPEAKER_01]: I have spoken with over 22 families in the district.

274
00:35:47,343 --> 00:35:49,003
[SPEAKER_01]: They all have a child with dyslexia.

275
00:35:49,543 --> 00:35:51,324
[SPEAKER_01]: They have had similar experiences.

276
00:35:51,704 --> 00:35:53,004
[SPEAKER_01]: We are told to wait and see.

277
00:35:53,764 --> 00:35:54,885
[SPEAKER_01]: He'll catch up on his own.

278
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:56,145
[SPEAKER_01]: Trust us.

279
00:35:56,725 --> 00:35:59,806
[SPEAKER_01]: And my favorite, have you tried reading to him?

280
00:36:00,706 --> 00:36:06,087
[SPEAKER_01]: I started reaching out to special education lawyers with success helping students with dyslexia.

281
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:12,149
[SPEAKER_01]: One recommended that individual families file a complaint with the Federal Office of Civil Rights

282
00:36:12,589 --> 00:36:14,110
[SPEAKER_01]: to compel the district to act.

283
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:18,831
[SPEAKER_01]: She believes that there is a systematic denial of fate for students with dyslexia.

284
00:36:19,332 --> 00:36:27,955
[SPEAKER_01]: Another attorney advised me that the Wilson Foundation program is a general education program and does not meet the federal criteria for reading instruction.

285
00:36:28,475 --> 00:36:31,556
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the program that he received for two and a half years.

286
00:36:32,296 --> 00:36:35,718
[SPEAKER_01]: No one noticed that my son could not read, write, or spell.

287
00:36:36,338 --> 00:36:39,899
[SPEAKER_01]: I am asking you to make dyslexia a priority in professional development.

288
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:52,867
[SPEAKER_01]: Education and special education teachers need to be able to recognize this learning disability and to be able to teach all students to read in an explicit, systematic, cumulative, and robust manner.

289
00:36:53,387 --> 00:36:55,649
[SPEAKER_01]: My final thought I would like to express is this.

290
00:36:56,229 --> 00:37:05,615
[SPEAKER_01]: If schools fought as hard for those with dyslexia as they do against it, we would have a completely different and substantially less impacted special education system.

291
00:37:07,896 --> 00:37:08,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

292
00:37:08,416 --> 00:37:09,117
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

293
00:37:14,005 --> 00:37:14,725
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Ruggiero?

294
00:37:15,486 --> 00:37:19,828
[SPEAKER_17]: Mayor Burke, the story that you just shared with us, can you come back to the podium please?

295
00:37:19,868 --> 00:37:20,268
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry.

296
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:27,732
[SPEAKER_17]: Your story that you shared with us is not, I mean I've talked to other parents that have had similar experiences as well.

297
00:37:28,993 --> 00:37:31,995
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd like to recommend that we, oh I'm sorry, excuse me.

298
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:39,324
[SPEAKER_17]: The experience that you shared with us is a story I've heard before, especially with dyslexic children.

299
00:37:40,385 --> 00:37:54,755
[SPEAKER_17]: And to this end, in regards to what you've brought up, I would like to, at least maybe not tonight, if we can't get it on the agenda, but maybe we can do it another night where we can ask for a report for dyslexia, like a dyslexia audit from the school system.

300
00:37:54,775 --> 00:37:56,757
[SPEAKER_17]: Would something like that be possible, Superintendent?

301
00:37:58,798 --> 00:38:00,740
[SPEAKER_18]: So this evening we have

302
00:38:01,864 --> 00:38:09,167
[SPEAKER_18]: a presentation for you from Dr. Nadine Gabb, who's going to talk about what research says about dyslexia.

303
00:38:09,667 --> 00:38:16,190
[SPEAKER_18]: And in terms of discussing students on the floor of the school committee, normally that is not done.

304
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:18,991
[SPEAKER_18]: That is not recommended practice.

305
00:38:20,871 --> 00:38:24,733
[SPEAKER_18]: I appreciate what has been said, and I know that there's work that we can all do.

306
00:38:25,493 --> 00:38:44,172
[SPEAKER_18]: But in terms of having a report on a general number of students that may or may not have a particular disability, I would have to defer to our Director of Pupil Services for the total number of students with a particular disability.

307
00:38:45,721 --> 00:38:48,903
[SPEAKER_17]: My concern would be just making sure that we're doing the best for curriculum.

308
00:38:48,923 --> 00:38:56,928
[SPEAKER_17]: I appreciate the presentation that we're going to have tonight, but it would be useful for me to understand where we are as a community versus just research.

309
00:38:57,168 --> 00:39:09,416
[SPEAKER_18]: So once you see the presentations today and what the district is doing, I think you're going to receive a lot of new information today and know the direction that the district is moving in.

310
00:39:12,796 --> 00:39:13,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Benedetto.

311
00:39:13,877 --> 00:39:14,337
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

312
00:39:15,158 --> 00:39:22,926
[SPEAKER_08]: I also, I just want to thank the parent for coming forward and putting her face to what we're learning about next.

313
00:39:23,746 --> 00:39:28,511
[SPEAKER_08]: And her family's story, telling it publicly is not always easy.

314
00:39:29,132 --> 00:39:34,497
[SPEAKER_08]: And it helps make it relevant as we learn more and what our next steps should be.

315
00:39:37,577 --> 00:39:43,642
[SPEAKER_08]: It puts a picture together for us that what we're working for, and I appreciate you coming forward and sharing that.

316
00:39:44,082 --> 00:39:46,324
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very important for us to see that.

317
00:39:46,965 --> 00:39:47,325
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

318
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:48,666
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

319
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:49,647
[SPEAKER_08]: Van der Kloot, did you want to?

320
00:39:51,148 --> 00:39:52,689
[SPEAKER_11]: I would also like to thank the parent.

321
00:39:52,750 --> 00:40:03,438
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to tell you that I wish that many years ago when my youngest, I didn't realize, we didn't know until much later that she was dyslexic, and it's actually impacted her whole life.

322
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:06,601
[SPEAKER_11]: With that being said,

323
00:40:07,065 --> 00:40:16,151
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it would make sense for us to again suspend the order of business and go directly to the reports on dyslexia since we've now gotten into the topic.

324
00:40:18,112 --> 00:40:23,616
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a motion on the floor to take papers 2 and 3 out of order, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

325
00:40:23,636 --> 00:40:24,317
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

326
00:40:24,337 --> 00:40:24,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

327
00:40:24,997 --> 00:40:25,638
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

328
00:40:25,658 --> 00:40:27,199
[SPEAKER_06]: Those papers will be before us now.

329
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:33,643
[SPEAKER_06]: I also want to state that one of my children had it and it was a brand new teacher to the system that said,

330
00:40:34,591 --> 00:40:35,632
[SPEAKER_06]: your child has a glitch.

331
00:40:36,272 --> 00:40:36,893
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a glitch.

332
00:40:36,973 --> 00:40:37,754
[SPEAKER_06]: There's something wrong.

333
00:40:37,774 --> 00:40:38,614
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to check it out.

334
00:40:38,714 --> 00:40:47,682
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's one of those bright stars, one of those bright teachers that just sees something different, and it changes the whole course of the child's life.

335
00:40:47,802 --> 00:40:50,704
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you to the teachers that are still in the audience here.

336
00:40:51,925 --> 00:40:54,307
[SPEAKER_06]: Item two, report on the science of dyslexia.

337
00:40:54,347 --> 00:40:55,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Nadine Gabb.

338
00:40:56,889 --> 00:40:57,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Gabb, I'm sorry.

339
00:41:01,893 --> 00:41:02,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening.

340
00:41:04,206 --> 00:41:04,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening.

341
00:41:04,786 --> 00:41:05,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for having me.

342
00:41:06,087 --> 00:41:06,708
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.

343
00:41:10,291 --> 00:41:15,094
[SPEAKER_06]: While that's being set up, I would like to read a biography on Dr. Gabb.

344
00:41:15,134 --> 00:41:20,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Gabb is an associate professor of pediatrics at Boston Children's Hospital and the Harvard Medical School.

345
00:41:20,858 --> 00:41:28,184
[SPEAKER_06]: She received her PhD in psychology from the University of Zurich in Switzerland and did post-doctoral training at Stanford University and MIT.

346
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:38,825
[SPEAKER_06]: Her research with the laboratories of cognitive neuroscience focuses on the development of typical and atypical language and literary skills, as well as pre-markers of learning disabilities.

347
00:41:39,545 --> 00:41:46,508
[SPEAKER_06]: More specifically, she works on the identification of possible pre-markers of reading disabilities, including developmental dyslexia.

348
00:41:47,068 --> 00:41:57,013
[SPEAKER_06]: In the pre-reading and infant brain, the identification of the underlying neural mechanism of comorbidity of developmental dyslexia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

349
00:41:57,685 --> 00:42:02,347
[SPEAKER_06]: and the development of tablet-based technology for early screening approaches for learning disabilities.

350
00:42:03,027 --> 00:42:09,369
[SPEAKER_06]: Her lab works closely with over 50 private and public schools nationwide, and she's a frequent speaker in the community.

351
00:42:09,869 --> 00:42:25,435
[SPEAKER_06]: She's the 2019 recipient of the LDA Award, Learning Disabilities Association of America Award, and in 2018, Dr. Gabb was presented with the Alan C. Crocker Award for her advocacy on behalf of children with dyslexia and reading disabilities and efforts around the recent passage

352
00:42:25,942 --> 00:42:28,103
[SPEAKER_06]: of the Massachusetts Screening Legislation.

353
00:42:28,704 --> 00:42:38,949
[SPEAKER_06]: She has also been recognized by the International Dyslexia Association in receipt of the Alice H. Garside Award for Outstanding Leadership in Advancing the Science and Advocacy of Dyslexia.

354
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:44,612
[SPEAKER_06]: She is further a recipient of the T. Barry Brazelton Award for Innovation at Boston's Children's Hospital.

355
00:42:45,173 --> 00:42:52,817
[SPEAKER_06]: She's a scientific advisory board member of the Dyslexia Foundation and Landmark School and a founder of the New England Research on Dyslexia Society.

356
00:42:53,417 --> 00:42:54,398
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome, Dr. Gobb.

357
00:43:18,877 --> 00:43:43,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, yeah, so I would like to cover the next 15 to 20 minutes some of the basic research that has come out of many different research laboratories around the world when it comes to dyslexia and reading disabilities related to the brain, but also to advocacy and policy when we talk about early screening and identification of dyslexia.

358
00:43:43,798 --> 00:43:50,663
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to start with a rough timeline of typical reading development so that we all in the room have the same terminologies.

359
00:43:51,583 --> 00:43:53,605
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there's a lot of educators in the room.

360
00:43:53,985 --> 00:44:03,351
[SPEAKER_02]: So usually when people ask, when does reading development start, people say, well, maybe in preschool, maybe the first day of kindergarten.

361
00:44:03,791 --> 00:44:13,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, reading development starts in utero because the fundamental first milestone is sound processing as well as visual processing right after birth.

362
00:44:14,158 --> 00:44:24,826
[SPEAKER_02]: We then move on to phonological or phonemic awareness and letter recognition, which are very essential milestones in preschool, early kindergarten.

363
00:44:25,546 --> 00:44:37,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Then later on, children are mapping the sounds of language onto the written counterparts, and the ultimate goal of learning to read is reading fluently and comprehending what you read.

364
00:44:37,454 --> 00:44:43,278
[SPEAKER_02]: So as you can see, there's a lot of different things that can go wrong in this timeline, all the way from utero

365
00:44:43,758 --> 00:44:45,279
[SPEAKER_02]: to an adult reader.

366
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:52,745
[SPEAKER_02]: What's really important here is the timeline in the bottom, which is there is a shift from learning to read to reading to learn.

367
00:44:53,225 --> 00:45:01,211
[SPEAKER_02]: And this usually is very similar in each district and occurs around the end of second, beginning of third grade.

368
00:45:01,551 --> 00:45:15,658
[SPEAKER_02]: where teachers stop actively teaching how to read and then assume that children are reading and more using reading as a tool in order to gain content, access content knowledge.

369
00:45:16,058 --> 00:45:23,942
[SPEAKER_02]: So if a child is not reading by then when the shift happens, this can then have tremendous implications

370
00:45:24,742 --> 00:45:30,427
[SPEAKER_02]: on the self-esteem, on social life, on academic life.

371
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:34,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Academic life because it then affects work problems and math.

372
00:45:35,031 --> 00:45:39,695
[SPEAKER_02]: It will affect social studies because you can't access the homework.

373
00:45:40,116 --> 00:45:50,305
[SPEAKER_02]: It will affect social life during recess because everyone talks about how they read Harry Potter last night and you can't even read simple sentences.

374
00:45:51,525 --> 00:46:08,797
[SPEAKER_02]: What is really important is, and this is a very famous picture from Hollis Gabor, is most people only focus on this part of learning to read, the phonological awareness, the decoding, the sight word recognition, which is supposed to become increasingly more automatic.

375
00:46:09,237 --> 00:46:20,245
[SPEAKER_02]: But then the language piece is also really important, and we'll get back to this when we talk about screening, where we want to make sure that we are not just screening for these, you know,

376
00:46:21,246 --> 00:46:37,789
[SPEAKER_02]: more narrow views of learning to read, but also allowing for the screening of language skills, such as vocabulary, et cetera, which are also really important components, especially for reading fluency and reading comprehension.

377
00:46:38,988 --> 00:46:43,711
[SPEAKER_02]: The development of basic reading skills is one of the primary goals of elementary education.

378
00:46:44,292 --> 00:46:52,818
[SPEAKER_02]: But as you probably know, 63% of fourth graders are reading below grade level and 80% of those are from low socioeconomic status backgrounds.

379
00:46:53,038 --> 00:46:57,441
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is from the most recent national report card.

380
00:46:58,542 --> 00:47:01,765
[SPEAKER_02]: This can have tremendous implications.

381
00:47:02,325 --> 00:47:18,340
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just imagine what it feels like if you were the king on the playground, climbing the highest, running the fastest, and then suddenly you start kindergarten and everyone else around you can figure this thing out, how to map the sounds to language, but you can't.

382
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:22,883
[SPEAKER_02]: This has tremendous implication for self-esteem really early on.

383
00:47:23,043 --> 00:47:26,806
[SPEAKER_02]: We see this as early as within the first couple of weeks of kindergarten.

384
00:47:27,206 --> 00:47:30,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Feelings of shame, inadequacy, helplessness.

385
00:47:30,408 --> 00:47:46,640
[SPEAKER_02]: We see very high rates of depression, anxiety in children as well as behavioral problems because before you start reading aloud in classroom in front of all the other children, you probably want to act up and end in the principal's office so you don't have to

386
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,902
[SPEAKER_02]: do this really difficult task for you.

387
00:47:49,422 --> 00:48:04,715
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at adolescents and adult outcomes, we know that children with dyslexia and other learning disabilities are less likely to complete high school or pursue higher education and are more likely to enter the juvenile justice system if this is not addressed.

388
00:48:05,116 --> 00:48:13,543
[SPEAKER_02]: There's even estimates now that up to a third of all inmates in the United States of America currently have a language-based learning disability.

389
00:48:14,107 --> 00:48:24,435
[SPEAKER_02]: We also know that about 90% of working age adults with learning disabilities have annual incomes less than $50,000, and often even lower than this.

390
00:48:24,595 --> 00:48:27,277
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has tremendous implication on society as a whole.

391
00:48:27,897 --> 00:48:36,644
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you look at the nation's report card, what is really striking here, and this is where the 63% come from, this is from 2017.

392
00:48:37,184 --> 00:48:42,448
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another one due this year, but I don't expect the numbers to change.

393
00:48:42,768 --> 00:48:49,953
[SPEAKER_02]: What's really striking here is that the average of all children in the United States is below the proficient one.

394
00:48:51,274 --> 00:48:58,178
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see the number has not changed at all from 1992 all the way to 2017.

395
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:08,826
[SPEAKER_02]: So something more fundamental has to happen than some of the policies that were put in place like no child left behind, et cetera.

396
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:18,581
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are a poor reader in 1st grade, 70% of these poor readers remain poor readers in 8th grade.

397
00:49:18,641 --> 00:49:22,125
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can see this as early as kindergarten.

398
00:49:22,486 --> 00:49:24,629
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have to wait until we get to this.

399
00:49:25,851 --> 00:49:41,452
[SPEAKER_02]: What's really, really striking is that students at the 90th percentile, so only 10% of kids are reading better, read as many words in three days as a child at the 10th percentile reads in an entire year outside of school.

400
00:49:42,236 --> 00:49:57,636
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see what a tremendous impact poor reading has also on how they perceive the world, how much additional content knowledge, just information about the world these kids are not getting because they're not

401
00:49:58,016 --> 00:50:01,640
[SPEAKER_02]: reading the magazines that the doctors offers, the ads on the bus.

402
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:04,943
[SPEAKER_02]: We are not talking about like high level literature here.

403
00:50:04,983 --> 00:50:10,228
[SPEAKER_02]: We are talking about the number of vocabulary that a child adds through reading.

404
00:50:10,408 --> 00:50:17,495
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know for instance that an average kindergartner starts kindergarten with about 10,000 words of vocabulary.

405
00:50:17,535 --> 00:50:19,197
[SPEAKER_02]: So they know the meaning of about 10,000 words.

406
00:50:20,658 --> 00:50:22,439
[SPEAKER_02]: By fifth grade, this goes up to 60,000.

407
00:50:23,379 --> 00:50:30,381
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know that the difference of these 50,000 words are primarily coming from reading.

408
00:50:30,762 --> 00:50:33,022
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not coming anymore from your parents.

409
00:50:33,422 --> 00:50:35,763
[SPEAKER_02]: The bad words may still come from your siblings.

410
00:50:36,203 --> 00:50:43,926
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's primarily through the access of reading material that you build this additional vocabulary.

411
00:50:44,626 --> 00:50:49,128
[SPEAKER_02]: So what are factors contributing to atypical reading development, including dyslexia?

412
00:50:49,748 --> 00:50:58,771
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we know is that reading disability is an umbrella, that dyslexia is under the umbrella, and also reading difficulty is a result of other circumstances.

413
00:50:59,652 --> 00:51:08,835
[SPEAKER_02]: What's really important here is that all the interventions that we currently know that work for dyslexia also work for other poor readers.

414
00:51:09,375 --> 00:51:26,418
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's no reason to just give certain interventions to kids with dyslexia, but not kids who are reading at the low level due to maybe low vocabulary or low language skills or a language deficit.

415
00:51:26,818 --> 00:51:27,978
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is dyslexia?

416
00:51:28,339 --> 00:51:30,879
[SPEAKER_02]: It affects about 10-12% of children.

417
00:51:31,279 --> 00:51:32,960
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a very accurate number.

418
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:37,661
[SPEAKER_02]: It has been shown in many different school districts that have looked at this.

419
00:51:37,962 --> 00:51:48,425
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know how many kids you have in the district, but you can make the numbers, you know, 10% of these kids should have a diagnosis of specific learning disability or dyslexia.

420
00:51:49,165 --> 00:51:53,588
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a specific learning disability with a neurobiological origin, I'll get to this.

421
00:51:54,008 --> 00:51:57,510
[SPEAKER_02]: It's characterized by difficulties on the word level.

422
00:51:57,710 --> 00:52:00,892
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are kids who have problems with decoding single words.

423
00:52:01,492 --> 00:52:08,596
[SPEAKER_02]: But this does not come from poor vision or hearing, lack of motivation, or lack of educational opportunities.

424
00:52:09,096 --> 00:52:20,343
[SPEAKER_02]: What we do know is if you have an older sibling with dyslexia or you have a parent with dyslexia, you have a 50% chance to develop dyslexia yourself.

425
00:52:20,824 --> 00:52:21,944
[SPEAKER_02]: This is very high.

426
00:52:22,244 --> 00:52:25,446
[SPEAKER_02]: This is much higher than a lot of the other developmental disabilities.

427
00:52:25,827 --> 00:52:31,911
[SPEAKER_02]: So one in two children with an older sibling or a parent will develop dyslexia themselves.

428
00:52:32,711 --> 00:52:38,015
[SPEAKER_02]: What we do know is there are structural and functional brain alterations in dyslexia.

429
00:52:38,416 --> 00:52:47,743
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are certain areas in the brain that are really involved in learning to read and fluent reading with high comprehension.

430
00:52:48,363 --> 00:52:52,947
[SPEAKER_02]: And many, many different research studies have shown over the last 15 years

431
00:52:54,728 --> 00:53:15,883
[SPEAKER_02]: that there is less neurons in these brain regions in children and adults with dyslexia, that the connections, the highways that connect the two regions or three regions that are involved in learning to read or fluent reading are less developed, show less volume, et cetera, et cetera.

432
00:53:16,083 --> 00:53:19,206
[SPEAKER_02]: So this has been shown many times before.

433
00:53:20,146 --> 00:53:25,269
[SPEAKER_02]: What's also really striking is this discrepancy here.

434
00:53:25,569 --> 00:53:37,977
[SPEAKER_02]: The dyslexia paradox is the discrepancy between the current diagnosis and start of intervention when this happens and the window for the most effective intervention.

435
00:53:38,297 --> 00:53:39,778
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll quickly walk you through this.

436
00:53:40,418 --> 00:53:44,261
[SPEAKER_02]: So the current diagnosis start of intensive intervention window

437
00:53:45,041 --> 00:53:52,926
[SPEAKER_02]: usually only happens after a child significantly fails over a long period of time.

438
00:53:53,106 --> 00:53:55,068
[SPEAKER_02]: We call it the way to fail approach.

439
00:53:55,608 --> 00:53:59,431
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the approach we currently do in most districts.

440
00:54:00,531 --> 00:54:04,535
[SPEAKER_02]: And you hear things like, oh, you know, he's a summer baby.

441
00:54:04,915 --> 00:54:05,896
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll catch up.

442
00:54:06,377 --> 00:54:09,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, she's just late developing, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

443
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:18,307
[SPEAKER_02]: These children, usually if they're lucky, and it happens early, have to wait till the end of second, beginning of third grade.

444
00:54:18,487 --> 00:54:23,392
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is kindergarten, first grade, second grade, often third grade.

445
00:54:23,792 --> 00:54:34,619
[SPEAKER_02]: for three to four years before someone says, okay, he or she has failed long enough, now we're going to start looking more specifically into this.

446
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:47,848
[SPEAKER_02]: What's really sad is that research has shown, and not just one research study, 20, 25, that the window for the most effective intervention is in kindergarten and first grade.

447
00:54:48,408 --> 00:54:50,531
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's two reasons for this, at least.

448
00:54:51,212 --> 00:54:55,597
[SPEAKER_02]: One is the brain is a lot more plastic the younger it is for language.

449
00:54:56,058 --> 00:55:00,824
[SPEAKER_02]: And one example would be we all move to a foreign country tomorrow.

450
00:55:00,944 --> 00:55:03,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say we all move to Greece.

451
00:55:04,048 --> 00:55:06,409
[SPEAKER_02]: And I assume no one speaks Greek here for today.

452
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:15,153
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can guarantee you we would have a wonderful time in Greece, but none of you would ever sound like a native speaker, ever.

453
00:55:15,433 --> 00:55:23,276
[SPEAKER_02]: You would always have an accent, you would always make mistakes with syntax, as well as vocabulary.

454
00:55:23,396 --> 00:55:26,317
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been in this country for 20 years, I still have a strong accent.

455
00:55:26,917 --> 00:55:28,298
[SPEAKER_02]: If we move a four-year-old,

456
00:55:30,183 --> 00:55:36,169
[SPEAKER_02]: I can guarantee you that in one, two years, you will not be able to distinguish them from a native speaker.

457
00:55:36,669 --> 00:55:40,793
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is just one example of how the brain is so much more fluent for language.

458
00:55:42,855 --> 00:55:54,145
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know there are behavioral predictors of dyslexia, and many studies have shown that they are accurately predicting who will go on to develop dyslexia and who will not.

459
00:55:55,233 --> 00:56:01,799
[SPEAKER_02]: We also know that these brain alterations that I showed you earlier predate the onset of kindergarten.

460
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:11,889
[SPEAKER_02]: This is work from my lab showing that preschoolers, the summer before kindergarten, already show these brain characteristics.

461
00:56:12,390 --> 00:56:20,037
[SPEAKER_02]: And that suggests that they're stepping into their first day of kindergarten with a less optimal brain to learn to read.

462
00:56:20,492 --> 00:56:25,633
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's no reason to wait for second grade or third grade to give them the help they need.

463
00:56:26,133 --> 00:56:34,555
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at the left side here, you can see typical children at the start of kindergarten, at risk children, and then three months later.

464
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:37,935
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see they're starting to build a reading network here.

465
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:46,577
[SPEAKER_02]: This brain here also shows changes, but outside of what we would expect of the network that's important for reading.

466
00:56:47,605 --> 00:56:57,591
[SPEAKER_02]: We also see that the highways that connect different regions in the brain are different in children who later on develop dyslexia versus not.

467
00:56:57,651 --> 00:56:59,372
[SPEAKER_02]: And we see this very, very early.

468
00:56:59,912 --> 00:57:02,694
[SPEAKER_02]: We do currently a study in infants.

469
00:57:02,894 --> 00:57:08,818
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are infants with an older sibling of dyslexia or a parent of dyslexia.

470
00:57:09,238 --> 00:57:13,581
[SPEAKER_02]: And we could show these brain characteristics already in infancy.

471
00:57:14,621 --> 00:57:22,406
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can then look at infants and pre-readers, beginning readers and fluent readers, there's the same brain characteristics.

472
00:57:22,806 --> 00:57:25,228
[SPEAKER_02]: So we see this as early as infancy.

473
00:57:25,648 --> 00:57:31,612
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's no reason to wait and let them fail and see whether they catch up, etc.

474
00:57:31,992 --> 00:57:38,055
[SPEAKER_02]: If it is dyslexia, if they have problems learning to read, then it will only get worse.

475
00:57:39,216 --> 00:57:40,536
[SPEAKER_02]: So how can we solve this?

476
00:57:41,237 --> 00:57:46,158
[SPEAKER_02]: So solving the dyslexia paradox really involves a paradigm shift.

477
00:57:46,518 --> 00:57:54,741
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the states, as well as the whole nation right now, is preparing and looking at this.

478
00:57:55,161 --> 00:58:02,763
[SPEAKER_02]: There is now 26 states in the United States that have dyslexia laws, especially dyslexia laws related to screening.

479
00:58:03,303 --> 00:58:17,503
[SPEAKER_02]: We were very involved in the passing of the law that was just signed by Governor Baker on October 16th, and it requires mandatory screening for dyslexia for all kindergartners in Massachusetts.

480
00:58:18,416 --> 00:58:27,219
[SPEAKER_02]: So the idea here is that you do comprehensive early risk screening and evidence-based response to screening within general education.

481
00:58:27,939 --> 00:58:34,502
[SPEAKER_02]: So the idea here is not to put all these children in special ed.

482
00:58:35,422 --> 00:58:44,405
[SPEAKER_02]: The idea here is more like the medical model that we use to detect, for instance, heart disease, and I gave you the example.

483
00:58:44,925 --> 00:58:52,147
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can screen for high cholesterol, and if you have high cholesterol, you do not get a diagnosis of heart disease.

484
00:58:52,887 --> 00:58:56,588
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that you are at risk to develop heart disease.

485
00:58:57,188 --> 00:59:11,879
[SPEAKER_02]: So what then your physician does with you, they maybe put you on medication, maybe change your diet, maybe change your exercise level, with the goal that you will never develop heart disease.

486
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if you develop it, it will be less severe.

487
00:59:15,182 --> 00:59:16,563
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the same idea here.

488
00:59:16,823 --> 00:59:26,957
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to screen in kindergarten and identify the children at risk who have a higher risk to develop dyslexia or reading impairment.

489
00:59:27,457 --> 00:59:32,144
[SPEAKER_02]: We will then, within general education, with really well-trained, empowered teachers,

490
00:59:32,584 --> 00:59:42,170
[SPEAKER_02]: address this so that the rates, that we have lower rates of dyslexia, reading disability at the end of second or third grade.

491
00:59:42,631 --> 00:59:55,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if someone gets a diagnosis, it's less severe because they already have all these years of really targeted remediation intervention practices in place.

492
00:59:56,431 --> 01:00:10,850
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been done, there's a study from Florida showing that it works really, really well and that these kids have much better outcomes, especially if you screen for all reading disabilities, not just specifically dyslexia.

493
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:13,793
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a recommended screening battery.

494
01:00:13,833 --> 01:00:18,758
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy to share this with educators, administrators.

495
01:00:19,759 --> 01:00:30,710
[SPEAKER_02]: We also, from the International Dyslexia Association, really work closely with districts to see what kind of resources they have.

496
01:00:31,111 --> 01:00:35,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they already have some of the assessments that would allow for screening?

497
01:00:35,995 --> 01:00:45,437
[SPEAKER_02]: to make sure that they're screening early, to make sure that they're asking family members, is there anyone in your family who was struggling learning to read growing up?

498
01:00:45,537 --> 01:00:52,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Because remember, the 50% of kids who have an older sibling who have a parent, that will develop dyslexia.

499
01:00:52,319 --> 01:00:54,659
[SPEAKER_02]: It's important to include ESL learners.

500
01:00:54,679 --> 01:00:57,900
[SPEAKER_02]: It's important to include dialect inclusion.

501
01:00:58,553 --> 01:01:04,560
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's evenly important to put evidence-based response to screening.

502
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:11,567
[SPEAKER_02]: So I work with a lot of districts and they say, oh, Dr. Agar, can you help us to be compliant with the law by the fall?

503
01:01:12,028 --> 01:01:15,311
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, okay, let's sit and talk about this.

504
01:01:15,411 --> 01:01:16,813
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, well, if you

505
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:21,357
[SPEAKER_02]: put the screening in place, you need to put the evidence-based response to screening in there.

506
01:01:21,677 --> 01:01:26,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, you just screen for cholesterol, but you don't do anything in response to it.

507
01:01:26,501 --> 01:01:27,822
[SPEAKER_02]: So it has to be a package.

508
01:01:27,902 --> 01:01:30,044
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to be a package that does both.

509
01:01:30,945 --> 01:01:33,888
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is just some work from decoding dyslexia.

510
01:01:33,908 --> 01:01:38,892
[SPEAKER_02]: You're probably familiar with the Act Relative to Dyslexia that was passed in October 2018.

511
01:01:39,833 --> 01:01:43,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Early screening to identify students at risk.

512
01:01:43,996 --> 01:01:52,324
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a combination of the MEAP Child Find Federal Guidelines and the MH Chapter 71B Section 3.

513
01:01:53,705 --> 01:02:06,998
[SPEAKER_02]: So we want to identify the problem and really move from the current model with the high incidence where it's gradually identified and only a fraction of kids on IEPs read proficiently.

514
01:02:07,798 --> 01:02:25,874
[SPEAKER_02]: screen-to-intervene model, where you screen early, put interventions in place, and it takes a lot less if you do this early, because you don't have this big gap between kids who have problems with reading and kids who don't.

515
01:02:26,654 --> 01:02:30,057
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is just an overview of the different reading laws.

516
01:02:30,097 --> 01:02:36,403
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have the federal required action and then the new state required action that was just passed.

517
01:02:36,704 --> 01:02:42,089
[SPEAKER_02]: And to my knowledge, the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education are currently working on guidelines

518
01:02:42,529 --> 01:02:56,555
[SPEAKER_02]: for the districts, but I strongly encourage everyone to think about this before the guidelines come out, because once the guidelines come out, it requires a lot of rethinking and planning.

519
01:02:57,415 --> 01:03:03,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so just 10 myths about dyslexia screening before I finish.

520
01:03:04,858 --> 01:03:10,020
[SPEAKER_02]: First one, signs of dyslexia can only be seen after two to three years of reading instruction.

521
01:03:10,581 --> 01:03:12,942
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the case 25 years ago.

522
01:03:13,362 --> 01:03:15,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the research has caught up.

523
01:03:15,343 --> 01:03:18,084
[SPEAKER_02]: We know exactly how to identify these children.

524
01:03:18,324 --> 01:03:19,905
[SPEAKER_02]: We know exactly what they need.

525
01:03:20,165 --> 01:03:24,247
[SPEAKER_02]: We know exactly that they need this early in order to catch up.

526
01:03:25,448 --> 01:03:29,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Screening is expensive and has low sensitivity and low specificity.

527
01:03:29,572 --> 01:03:41,203
[SPEAKER_02]: There are ways now, screening tools that are a lot less expensive, like we are developing one on a tablet right now that can be administered in a large group, for instance.

528
01:03:41,243 --> 01:03:43,946
[SPEAKER_02]: There's other really great things out there.

529
01:03:44,686 --> 01:03:47,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Screening tests will only add more testing to the kindergarten age.

530
01:03:48,309 --> 01:04:13,025
[SPEAKER_02]: I do a lot of professional development in school districts, and all the teachers tell me this will be really helpful to know the first day of kindergarten, who do I actually have in my classroom, and who is lacking which early literacy milestones to then plan ahead and really try to address this early before it becomes a problem in first, second, and third grade.

531
01:04:15,186 --> 01:04:21,109
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have to go through all of those, but the screening will give children a diagnosis at age 4.

532
01:04:21,449 --> 01:04:25,131
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope I convinced you that this is not what we are trying to do.

533
01:04:25,191 --> 01:04:26,912
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not what the law is about.

534
01:04:27,232 --> 01:04:34,475
[SPEAKER_02]: The law is about identifying children at risk so we can help them early when the brain is most plastic.

535
01:04:35,976 --> 01:04:45,818
[SPEAKER_02]: in response to language so that they never develop the devastating feelings of shame and helplessness, et cetera.

536
01:04:46,438 --> 01:04:49,959
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thank you and answer any question if you have any.

537
01:04:50,839 --> 01:04:51,799
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

538
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:53,120
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

539
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:55,980
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Ruggiero.

540
01:04:56,180 --> 01:04:56,480
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

541
01:04:57,201 --> 01:04:57,821
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mayor Burke.

542
01:04:58,481 --> 01:05:00,801
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, doctor, for this very informative presentation.

543
01:05:00,821 --> 01:05:03,522
[SPEAKER_17]: There are a number of things that you brought up that really interested me.

544
01:05:04,985 --> 01:05:16,228
[SPEAKER_17]: One of the things I guess that concerns me, so we can expect, according to your research, we can expect 10% of the students in our school system at all grade levels are suffering from dyslexia.

545
01:05:17,389 --> 01:05:29,532
[SPEAKER_17]: Of that 10%, how many, I wasn't sure if I caught it in your presentation, if I missed it, I apologize, but what percentage of students that are in that 10% category are actually aware of their dyslexia?

546
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:36,464
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they should all be aware because they would all be struggling with reading.

547
01:05:36,845 --> 01:05:39,406
[SPEAKER_17]: Would they be medically diagnosed with... No.

548
01:05:39,787 --> 01:05:51,955
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying if you would probably have a neuropsych evaluation for every student in your district, you would have a diagnosis in 10% of your students.

549
01:05:51,995 --> 01:05:53,456
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, let me clarify my question.

550
01:05:53,597 --> 01:05:56,979
[SPEAKER_17]: So of the 10% that have dyslexia,

551
01:05:57,540 --> 01:06:03,906
[SPEAKER_17]: How many have a medical, what percentage of that 10% have a medical diagnosis of dyslexia?

552
01:06:05,273 --> 01:06:07,615
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure what you mean.

553
01:06:07,715 --> 01:06:11,037
[SPEAKER_02]: So they all would have a medical diagnosis of dyslexia.

554
01:06:11,298 --> 01:06:15,241
[SPEAKER_02]: There's other kids who are struggling with reading who are on top of this.

555
01:06:15,781 --> 01:06:19,844
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the 63% that are not reading on grade level.

556
01:06:20,265 --> 01:06:28,191
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have 43% in the United States that are not reading on grade level for whatever reason, and 10% or 53% versus 10% have dyslexia.

557
01:06:28,211 --> 01:06:29,452
[SPEAKER_02]: And one thing also that

558
01:06:33,484 --> 01:06:35,187
[SPEAKER_17]: that I would like your advice on.

559
01:06:35,267 --> 01:06:48,247
[SPEAKER_17]: So for the students that are in the sixth grade, the seventh grade, they've moved beyond their optimal time for treatment, and they're sort of, they went through the wait to fail model, I guess, and they're in the fifth grade, sixth grade.

560
01:06:48,747 --> 01:06:51,788
[SPEAKER_17]: What steps should we take to address those students?

561
01:06:51,848 --> 01:07:03,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so just to clarify, just because they're outside of the window of the most optimal or most effective window doesn't mean that it's not effective anymore to do remediation intervention with these children.

562
01:07:03,931 --> 01:07:07,852
[SPEAKER_02]: So you should really make sure that these kids get

563
01:07:09,232 --> 01:07:11,934
[SPEAKER_02]: proper intervention remediation right away.

564
01:07:12,394 --> 01:07:23,401
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some evidence-based programs that have been shown to be really helpful for children with dyslexia.

565
01:07:24,062 --> 01:07:27,364
[SPEAKER_02]: And so ideally they would all get this.

566
01:07:28,425 --> 01:07:35,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Either in the language-based learning disability classroom or through special ed or whatever model you want to put in place.

567
01:07:39,026 --> 01:07:43,149
[SPEAKER_17]: You mentioned the tablet program that you're developing right now on an iPad.

568
01:07:44,349 --> 01:07:52,795
[SPEAKER_17]: What sort of training is necessary for teachers to quickly and adequately spot dyslexia early on so they can get the best treatment?

569
01:07:52,815 --> 01:07:54,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's the great thing about that tablet base.

570
01:07:54,816 --> 01:07:55,877
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are a couple others.

571
01:07:55,997 --> 01:07:58,538
[SPEAKER_02]: So it requires absolutely no training whatsoever.

572
01:07:58,598 --> 01:08:00,459
[SPEAKER_02]: The tablet base is self-administered.

573
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:03,661
[SPEAKER_02]: So you just give it to the child with headphones and you can walk away.

574
01:08:04,162 --> 01:08:05,863
[SPEAKER_02]: And the children are playing a game.

575
01:08:06,503 --> 01:08:12,308
[SPEAKER_02]: And through the game, you're screening for the early literacy milestones as well as dyslexia.

576
01:08:13,109 --> 01:08:28,522
[SPEAKER_02]: So it does not require any training for the teachers, but also no training on interpreting the result because the screener would just show you this kid is at risk for the following components of the components they should know.

577
01:08:28,722 --> 01:08:31,444
[SPEAKER_17]: How long does this little iPad quiz take or game?

578
01:08:31,464 --> 01:08:32,165
[SPEAKER_02]: 15 to 20 minutes.

579
01:08:32,185 --> 01:08:32,545
[SPEAKER_15]: 15 to 20 minutes?

580
01:08:32,645 --> 01:08:32,945
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

581
01:08:35,325 --> 01:08:38,887
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not currently out there, so you cannot get it.

582
01:08:39,727 --> 01:08:48,072
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing a nationwide validation study right now with many different school districts that will be out in 2020.

583
01:08:48,172 --> 01:08:50,213
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm not here to promote this.

584
01:08:50,534 --> 01:08:51,734
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to make sure.

585
01:08:51,754 --> 01:08:55,356
[SPEAKER_02]: There's actually 80 screeners out there, paper, pencil.

586
01:08:55,917 --> 01:08:57,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Out of the 80, there's probably

587
01:08:58,978 --> 01:09:01,719
[SPEAKER_02]: eight or nine that I could highly recommend.

588
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:04,601
[SPEAKER_02]: And not all of them require a lot of training.

589
01:09:04,981 --> 01:09:11,184
[SPEAKER_17]: So it would be something that we could maybe Xerox off and just let the kids play with for 20 minutes?

590
01:09:12,144 --> 01:09:14,165
[SPEAKER_02]: So it would be an assessment.

591
01:09:14,906 --> 01:09:16,066
[SPEAKER_02]: But that could be done.

592
01:09:16,206 --> 01:09:19,568
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's lots of school districts already in Massachusetts.

593
01:09:19,888 --> 01:09:20,628
[SPEAKER_02]: We do this.

594
01:09:22,609 --> 01:09:28,271
[SPEAKER_02]: during the meeting with the kindergarten teacher in the first week of school or even in the summer before school.

595
01:09:28,991 --> 01:09:44,956
[SPEAKER_02]: There's lots of different models and I'm doing a lot of consultations for school districts and some do it in April before kindergarten once they know who's coming and it gives them a whole summer to plan ahead how to group them and what to do.

596
01:09:45,416 --> 01:09:46,977
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's lots of different districts.

597
01:09:46,997 --> 01:09:52,700
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's absolutely no excuse to say we don't have the money to find a screener or we don't have the trained personnel.

598
01:09:53,041 --> 01:09:53,941
[SPEAKER_02]: We are beyond that.

599
01:09:54,441 --> 01:09:54,642
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

600
01:09:54,782 --> 01:09:55,142
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

601
01:09:56,022 --> 01:09:56,363
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

602
01:09:57,703 --> 01:09:57,963
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

603
01:09:57,983 --> 01:09:58,624
[SPEAKER_11]: Van der Kloot.

604
01:09:59,564 --> 01:09:59,765
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

605
01:09:59,825 --> 01:10:12,292
[SPEAKER_11]: I just was curious whether there is any indication that for preschoolers, I mean, is this something that can be seen even earlier for a parent?

606
01:10:13,156 --> 01:10:15,657
[SPEAKER_11]: Are there particular sort of warning signs?

607
01:10:16,237 --> 01:10:16,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

608
01:10:16,597 --> 01:10:22,398
[SPEAKER_02]: So as I said, the screeners are usually for preschool and early kindergarten.

609
01:10:22,958 --> 01:10:29,119
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are some districts in Massachusetts but also nationwide that screen in preschool.

610
01:10:29,299 --> 01:10:39,481
[SPEAKER_02]: So they screen usually in the spring of preschool or they can screen in the fall of preschool and then have the whole preschool year to address this.

611
01:10:41,963 --> 01:10:48,405
[SPEAKER_11]: The other question is the parent who came before us noted that her student had in fact been given some remediation.

612
01:10:48,846 --> 01:10:54,388
[SPEAKER_11]: How do we figure out what's the best way to help a student?

613
01:10:55,608 --> 01:10:58,309
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll go with the model that the student has been screened early.

614
01:10:58,929 --> 01:11:05,932
[SPEAKER_11]: What is the approach that we're going to best meet the needs of a student who falls into that category?

615
01:11:06,636 --> 01:11:13,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so the screening is usually done for some key components.

616
01:11:13,259 --> 01:11:28,006
[SPEAKER_02]: So if the student, let's say, in kindergarten presents with low phonological awareness skills, there are certain programs that you can then put in place, even in general ed, that would boost this phonological awareness deficit.

617
01:11:28,966 --> 01:11:31,367
[SPEAKER_02]: kids that come with really low language skills.

618
01:11:31,607 --> 01:11:39,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually kids from low socioeconomic status families come with low vocabulary or oral listening comprehension.

619
01:11:39,669 --> 01:11:49,051
[SPEAKER_02]: So these kids often then have problems with reading fluently or comprehending what they read because they don't even understand how complex

620
01:11:49,471 --> 01:11:52,213
[SPEAKER_02]: or complex sentence is even constructed.

621
01:11:53,193 --> 01:11:57,216
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they would need a little bit of a different approach.

622
01:11:57,496 --> 01:12:02,139
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a bit like you being screened for high cholesterol.

623
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:11,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully you think your cardiologist would tell you what to do next and not just give every student or every patient the same pill, right?

624
01:12:11,746 --> 01:12:13,066
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's the same idea here.

625
01:12:13,507 --> 01:12:18,250
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're screened and then you have maybe three, four different approaches

626
01:12:19,096 --> 01:12:25,286
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's nothing that you cannot implement within general education, and some districts have already done this.

627
01:12:26,288 --> 01:12:30,295
[SPEAKER_11]: Who do you think is doing a particularly good job, if we think about

628
01:12:31,034 --> 01:12:32,435
[SPEAKER_11]: districts you've worked with?

629
01:12:32,555 --> 01:12:35,437
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy to look into this and go back.

630
01:12:36,237 --> 01:12:48,325
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been some really, I think, really great progress in Andover, for instance, that have, like, really looked at how they teach reading, how they screen for reading, how they respond.

631
01:12:48,385 --> 01:12:53,508
[SPEAKER_02]: They did a lot of professional development for their kindergarten teachers and first grade teachers.

632
01:12:54,229 --> 01:12:59,052
[SPEAKER_02]: There's other districts that are really thinking proactively and thinking, how can we address this?

633
01:12:59,911 --> 01:13:03,333
[SPEAKER_02]: more with the medical model, where we look at prevention.

634
01:13:03,413 --> 01:13:14,759
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're moving from a deficit-driven model to a preventive model, which is better for everyone, especially for the mental health of the students and the academic outcomes of these students.

635
01:13:15,239 --> 01:13:15,559
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

636
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:18,261
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Benedetto?

637
01:13:18,561 --> 01:13:20,802
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, and thank you for your presentation.

638
01:13:21,582 --> 01:13:26,305
[SPEAKER_08]: It sounds like you're working with a lot of different districts, and we want to know how we can get

639
01:13:26,894 --> 01:13:39,000
[SPEAKER_08]: you to work with the Medford district, what would be involved in that, what way you see us beginning, how you could walk us through some of the process, maybe come up with some ideas with our superintendent.

640
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:52,887
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if there's any grants we can apply for, because this is a new initiative coming out from the state, and how we get expertise like yourself in helping our children in our classrooms.

641
01:13:53,177 --> 01:13:53,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.

642
01:13:53,797 --> 01:13:56,478
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy to meet with you and give you some of the options.

643
01:13:56,578 --> 01:13:57,618
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just me.

644
01:13:57,998 --> 01:14:04,559
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also other wonderful players in the field, and you may want to talk to them as well.

645
01:14:04,619 --> 01:14:05,640
[SPEAKER_02]: I work closely with them.

646
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:19,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the Landmark School, for instance, has a really good program where they actually come into the district and look at all grade levels and see how dyslexia is addressed from the kindergarten age all the way to high school.

647
01:14:20,263 --> 01:14:20,863
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they

648
01:14:21,503 --> 01:14:30,192
[SPEAKER_02]: they tell you the different options, you know, what they think would be ideal versus, you know, more the middle ground versus what they would recommend minimally.

649
01:14:30,753 --> 01:14:35,457
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some other agencies, you know, and stakeholders like this.

650
01:14:35,578 --> 01:14:41,404
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm happy to give you a list so you can make an informed decision what you would like to do.

651
01:14:42,264 --> 01:14:44,667
[SPEAKER_18]: I also wanted to just comment that Dr. Garb did

652
01:14:45,027 --> 01:14:51,009
[SPEAKER_18]: did come and do a robust professional development session for our administrators.

653
01:14:51,089 --> 01:14:57,490
[SPEAKER_18]: So you're seeing an abbreviated version of a much shorter condensed version.

654
01:14:57,911 --> 01:15:10,614
[SPEAKER_18]: So we are definitely taking dyslexia very seriously and working on developing ourselves and being prepared to address the mandate that has come down from the state.

655
01:15:12,308 --> 01:15:13,008
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a question.

656
01:15:13,108 --> 01:15:15,810
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it a funded mandate or an unfunded mandate?

657
01:15:16,331 --> 01:15:17,912
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there grants available?

658
01:15:18,192 --> 01:15:19,734
[SPEAKER_18]: It's an unfunded mandate.

659
01:15:20,054 --> 01:15:20,334
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

660
01:15:21,435 --> 01:15:30,062
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's great to have mandates, but we as a committee or a school district have to find ways to fund these changes.

661
01:15:30,142 --> 01:15:37,488
[SPEAKER_08]: And if there's fundamental changes in how we need to teach reading and literacy to our early readers or early

662
01:15:40,714 --> 01:15:45,897
[SPEAKER_08]: beginning people, I think that education is like a foundation of a house.

663
01:15:46,377 --> 01:15:51,820
[SPEAKER_08]: If you catch it early and you have a strong foundation, you have a beautiful, strong house for many, many years.

664
01:15:52,320 --> 01:16:06,388
[SPEAKER_08]: And I always would love to do that, and I think this is worth investigating further for our district, and I would like to make a motion at this time through the mayor, to the superintendent,

665
01:16:06,752 --> 01:16:25,977
[SPEAKER_08]: please investigate and give us some costs involved in bringing either a landmark program, Dr. Gobb, or something similar before us with this budget so that way we can move forward immediately and less families and children have to come before us pleading for help for their kids.

666
01:16:26,817 --> 01:16:34,979
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this is tremendous, not only for kids with reading deficiencies, but I think how we look at reading fundamentally

667
01:16:36,232 --> 01:16:41,596
[SPEAKER_08]: and not early learners, so I'd like to make that motion at this time.

668
01:16:43,377 --> 01:16:45,239
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a motion on the floor, seconded by Ms.

669
01:16:45,259 --> 01:16:46,640
[SPEAKER_06]: Anne DeClune and Mr. Sciarro.

670
01:16:47,140 --> 01:16:47,901
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

671
01:16:47,921 --> 01:16:48,401
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

672
01:16:49,062 --> 01:16:49,682
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

673
01:16:49,762 --> 01:16:50,383
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

674
01:16:52,364 --> 01:16:52,544
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

675
01:16:52,585 --> 01:16:53,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Kreatz is in the queue next.

676
01:16:53,625 --> 01:16:53,685
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

677
01:16:54,286 --> 01:16:54,406
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi.

678
01:16:54,426 --> 01:16:54,586
[SPEAKER_16]: Ms.

679
01:16:54,606 --> 01:16:54,846
[SPEAKER_16]: Kreatz.

680
01:16:54,886 --> 01:16:55,827
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Dr. Gobb.

681
01:16:56,027 --> 01:16:56,387
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure.

682
01:16:56,828 --> 01:16:58,189
[SPEAKER_16]: The presentation was excellent.

683
01:16:58,249 --> 01:17:02,292
[SPEAKER_16]: It answered a lot of questions that I had about what the common signs are and symptoms.

684
01:17:02,785 --> 01:17:06,826
[SPEAKER_16]: I was curious, like, is dyslexia something that is curable?

685
01:17:06,846 --> 01:17:12,987
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, could somebody with early intervention outgrow dyslexia in their middle school and high school years?

686
01:17:13,347 --> 01:17:13,547
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

687
01:17:13,727 --> 01:17:23,489
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's actually evidence that if you catch it early and you do the right things, that about 60 to 90% of these kids develop typical reading skills.

688
01:17:23,810 --> 01:17:24,490
[SPEAKER_16]: Excellent.

689
01:17:24,550 --> 01:17:25,530
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that new research?

690
01:17:26,457 --> 01:17:29,278
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I can definitely send you the references.

691
01:17:29,298 --> 01:17:31,820
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably the last seven, eight years.

692
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:37,002
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was a meta-analysis over six studies showing the same effects.

693
01:17:37,663 --> 01:17:39,003
[SPEAKER_09]: Great, thank you.

694
01:17:39,223 --> 01:17:39,664
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll second.

695
01:17:39,844 --> 01:17:39,964
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

696
01:17:40,004 --> 01:17:40,244
[SPEAKER_09]: Kurtz?

697
01:17:40,284 --> 01:17:40,704
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

698
01:17:41,244 --> 01:17:41,845
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Ruggiero.

699
01:17:42,645 --> 01:17:45,587
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, just a follow-up question on the item.

700
01:17:45,627 --> 01:17:52,190
[SPEAKER_17]: If we could just sort of work towards having an audit of where we are with the various dyslexia.

701
01:17:52,310 --> 01:17:55,292
[SPEAKER_17]: Our next presentation is going to address many of these questions.

702
01:17:57,947 --> 01:17:59,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much for your presentation.

703
01:17:59,628 --> 01:18:03,709
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you'll stay while the next speakers address the system.

704
01:18:04,229 --> 01:18:04,729
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

705
01:18:09,611 --> 01:18:13,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Next up, report on Medford's response to dyslexia screening law.

706
01:18:13,293 --> 01:18:17,214
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Nicole Chiesa, Katie Champoli, and Susanna Campbell.

707
01:18:21,416 --> 01:18:27,718
[SPEAKER_18]: I just wanted to preface that Dr. Chiesa, our Director of Humanities, is working very closely

708
01:18:28,379 --> 01:18:42,881
[SPEAKER_18]: with our special education administrators, Katie Trampoli and Susanna Campbell, and really looking at what the district's next steps are going to be based on the guidance that we do have currently from the state.

709
01:18:44,102 --> 01:18:46,422
[SPEAKER_18]: So I look forward to the presentation.

710
01:18:47,062 --> 01:18:47,742
[SPEAKER_18]: Dr. Chiesa.

711
01:18:56,504 --> 01:18:57,004
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening.

712
01:18:57,324 --> 01:18:57,744
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening.

713
01:18:59,044 --> 01:19:04,327
[SPEAKER_00]: We have been asked here tonight to speak specifically on Medford's response to the Dyslexia Screening Law.

714
01:19:04,867 --> 01:19:08,709
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to organize the presentation in three different steps.

715
01:19:09,189 --> 01:19:14,871
[SPEAKER_00]: The first is an outline of exactly what the law says, so we can have a real clarity around that.

716
01:19:15,352 --> 01:19:20,114
[SPEAKER_00]: The second is the current steps that Medford has taken thus far in response to the law.

717
01:19:20,554 --> 01:19:26,256
[SPEAKER_00]: And the third is the future steps that Medford, with the school committee's support, hopes to move forward with.

718
01:19:28,038 --> 01:19:35,939
[SPEAKER_00]: To begin with the law, on October 19, 2018, Chapter 272 of the Acts of 2018 was approved by Massachusetts legislation.

719
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:45,621
[SPEAKER_00]: And the law specifically reads, and I really have to take a hard look at the law, even as a lawyer, to really understand it.

720
01:19:45,821 --> 01:19:54,923
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is that the law requires that DESE, in consultation with the Department of Early Education and Care, must issue guidelines to assist districts

721
01:19:55,430 --> 01:20:06,279
[SPEAKER_00]: in developing screening procedures or protocols for students that demonstrate one or more potential indicators of a neurological learning disability, including but not limited to dyslexia.

722
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:17,748
[SPEAKER_00]: So in response to this law, the school districts in Massachusetts are currently awaiting DESE's provision of specific guidelines for the screeners and protocols.

723
01:20:18,189 --> 01:20:23,153
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just important for us to understand that we don't have exactly what DESE

724
01:20:23,601 --> 01:20:24,221
[SPEAKER_00]: wants us to do.

725
01:20:24,381 --> 01:20:28,982
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't mean we're not moving forward, because we are, but I just want everybody to understand that.

726
01:20:29,082 --> 01:20:32,083
[SPEAKER_00]: We are awaiting DESE's response.

727
01:20:32,703 --> 01:20:40,485
[SPEAKER_00]: Through discussions with DESE, the district has learned that DESE, the Department of Education, is still seeking a vendor to develop these guidelines.

728
01:20:40,925 --> 01:20:49,787
[SPEAKER_00]: The vendor is going to organize, convene, and facilitate different groups, and then they will give a draft on the specific guidelines.

729
01:20:49,827 --> 01:20:50,807
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really know

730
01:20:51,317 --> 01:20:52,918
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly the expectations.

731
01:20:52,978 --> 01:20:54,078
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to miss anything.

732
01:20:55,159 --> 01:21:03,943
[SPEAKER_00]: The expected completion date for the guidelines has been pushed now to June 30, 2020, with a projected implementation for school year 2020 to 2021.

733
01:21:05,564 --> 01:21:08,665
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that doesn't mean that we are not moving forward, because we are.

734
01:21:08,825 --> 01:21:15,008
[SPEAKER_00]: So in anticipation of these guidelines, Medford Public Schools is implementing numerous proactive steps.

735
01:21:17,725 --> 01:21:27,487
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Vincent mentioned in February the district administrators attended Dr. Gabb's two-hour presentation on dyslexia and the new legislation.

736
01:21:28,207 --> 01:21:35,088
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had multiple staff members participate in graduate-level courses in dyslexia, dyscalculia, and dysgraphia.

737
01:21:35,828 --> 01:21:43,970
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had all of the special education teachers at the elementary level attend a web-based training entitled Dyslexia for Educators, an Overview.

738
01:21:45,359 --> 01:21:52,065
[SPEAKER_00]: and the high school did that as well, excuse me, so special education teachers at the elementary, middle, and high school level.

739
01:21:53,426 --> 01:21:58,930
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, the district has most recently established a Dyslexia Screening Law Task Force.

740
01:21:59,571 --> 01:22:12,581
[SPEAKER_00]: The task force is going to research and respond to the anticipated guidelines, and the discussions are including screeners, current and future interventions, including the wind block at the K-2 level,

741
01:22:13,735 --> 01:22:28,264
[SPEAKER_00]: the potential implementation of a new phonics program at the K-3 level, updates from DESE regarding the legislation, and response from educators in other states with similar legislation.

742
01:22:28,704 --> 01:22:40,471
[SPEAKER_00]: The purpose of the task force is to expand next year its membership to include representation from additional administration as well as reading specialists, special education, and general education teachers.

743
01:22:41,672 --> 01:22:43,233
[SPEAKER_00]: Although there is no legal requirement

744
01:22:43,709 --> 01:22:51,295
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, to presently utilize a screener, the district has decided to be proactive and implement a universal screener for next school year.

745
01:22:53,517 --> 01:23:06,346
[SPEAKER_00]: We've looked at what some other states have done, and we see that we have something called the Shaywitz Dyslexia Screen that is an efficient, reliable, and user-friendly universal screening measure for students who may be at risk for dyslexia.

746
01:23:06,787 --> 01:23:10,770
[SPEAKER_00]: The screener emphasizes phonological, linguistic, and academic performance.

747
01:23:11,497 --> 01:23:17,661
[SPEAKER_00]: and it will place our students into two groups, those at risk for dyslexia and those not at risk for dyslexia.

748
01:23:20,683 --> 01:23:27,948
[SPEAKER_00]: To support the implementation of this screener for next school year, K-2 teachers will participate in a live training webinar in May.

749
01:23:29,008 --> 01:23:38,675
[SPEAKER_00]: The screener is going to be administered in the fall for students in grades K, excuse me, for students in grades one and two, and in the winter for kindergarten students.

750
01:23:39,475 --> 01:23:40,636
[SPEAKER_00]: The results of this screener

751
01:23:41,087 --> 01:23:52,817
[SPEAKER_00]: will be used to first identify students at risk, but then to intervene with what we currently have, as well as additional evidence-based resources, and to then monitor progress.

752
01:23:53,057 --> 01:23:56,260
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything else?

753
01:23:57,941 --> 01:23:59,742
[SPEAKER_00]: That was just a basic overview for you.

754
01:23:59,923 --> 01:24:03,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I just ask a question?

755
01:24:03,205 --> 01:24:09,931
[SPEAKER_06]: I know when the doctor had up the chart, she said most focus on the bottom three and not the top six or seven.

756
01:24:10,444 --> 01:24:18,015
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the screen that you had up earlier, and it seems like what this second to the last paragraph is looking at is the bottom three.

757
01:24:18,035 --> 01:24:20,539
[SPEAKER_07]: Phonological and linguistic.

758
01:24:20,579 --> 01:24:20,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

759
01:24:22,161 --> 01:24:23,824
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we asking about hereditary?

760
01:24:25,276 --> 01:24:26,797
[SPEAKER_00]: And any of our questionnaires?

761
01:24:27,137 --> 01:24:32,280
[SPEAKER_00]: The specific Shaywitz Dyslexia screen does not, I don't know if they ask for that, Susanna, maybe at all times.

762
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:35,102
[SPEAKER_07]: It's difficult for us to say because I have not actually seen the screener with it.

763
01:24:35,162 --> 01:24:41,065
[SPEAKER_07]: We are in the process of purchasing it, so until you purchase it, you don't get to see all the questions, but it's essentially a questionnaire.

764
01:24:41,645 --> 01:24:42,466
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure you've seen it.

765
01:24:43,607 --> 01:24:44,628
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to comment on that.

766
01:24:44,648 --> 01:24:45,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.

767
01:24:45,588 --> 01:24:50,951
[SPEAKER_02]: So what the Shaywitz screener does is it does not directly assess the student.

768
01:24:51,311 --> 01:24:56,354
[SPEAKER_02]: It just asks the teacher a couple of questions.

769
01:24:56,954 --> 01:25:03,698
[SPEAKER_02]: So it does not directly test or assess the child, which has often been critiqued.

770
01:25:04,018 --> 01:25:07,020
[SPEAKER_02]: But it does have a familiar question in there.

771
01:25:08,821 --> 01:25:09,481
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Russo.

772
01:25:10,502 --> 01:25:10,902
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

773
01:25:11,102 --> 01:25:12,443
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for this work.

774
01:25:12,799 --> 01:25:13,859
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know it's a lot of work.

775
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:18,821
[SPEAKER_12]: I do want to say that the word proactive is becoming a bit offensive.

776
01:25:19,701 --> 01:25:26,644
[SPEAKER_12]: As a parent of a seventh grader who can barely read, it's not proactive.

777
01:25:27,444 --> 01:25:29,024
[SPEAKER_12]: We're decades behind.

778
01:25:31,065 --> 01:25:34,526
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we're proactive because we have the law coming down.

779
01:25:35,067 --> 01:25:38,808
[SPEAKER_12]: We are not proactive to all these kids that can't read in our district.

780
01:25:43,355 --> 01:25:48,777
[SPEAKER_12]: While there's lots of new evidence, the evidence has, for the most part, been very clear for decades.

781
01:25:49,557 --> 01:25:54,739
[SPEAKER_12]: And we refuse to teach phonics because it's boring and teachers don't want to be bored.

782
01:25:56,039 --> 01:26:02,101
[SPEAKER_12]: The reading wars were lost, and the teachers just decided to rebrand it, rather than teaching phonics.

783
01:26:03,661 --> 01:26:04,482
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the truth.

784
01:26:04,742 --> 01:26:10,003
[SPEAKER_12]: So my question is, after doing all this, these teachers are going to have to teach phonics.

785
01:26:12,816 --> 01:26:14,857
[SPEAKER_12]: What are we going to do with the teachers that refuse?

786
01:26:15,257 --> 01:26:18,098
[SPEAKER_12]: Because there are going to be teachers refusing to teach it, because it's boring.

787
01:26:18,718 --> 01:26:19,698
[SPEAKER_12]: I know it's boring.

788
01:26:20,498 --> 01:26:21,438
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important, though.

789
01:26:21,518 --> 01:26:22,079
[SPEAKER_00]: It's critical.

790
01:26:22,279 --> 01:26:27,260
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's not up to the teachers to decide that it's boring, and they're going to do it for two days a year and call that phonics.

791
01:26:29,081 --> 01:26:32,462
[SPEAKER_12]: So what are we going to do as a district when the teachers won't do it?

792
01:26:32,662 --> 01:26:40,744
[SPEAKER_12]: Because it's been, what, was it 1993 or 4 when this was decided by Congress because the teachers just couldn't work it out?

793
01:26:42,639 --> 01:26:46,102
[SPEAKER_18]: So this is going to be a district-wide initiative.

794
01:26:46,823 --> 01:26:51,828
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's not like you're going to have an option to not do it.

795
01:26:52,529 --> 01:27:02,078
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think you're implying that people have an option to say that they're not going to screen or not going to implement the curriculum.

796
01:27:05,914 --> 01:27:07,896
[SPEAKER_18]: It's something that we're going to do district-wide.

797
01:27:08,616 --> 01:27:24,129
[SPEAKER_18]: Although DESE is still waiting to give guidance, right now we don't have something formally in place, so trying to at least put a measure in place as a district so that we can at least get preliminary information while we are waiting to get

798
01:27:25,141 --> 01:27:27,242
[SPEAKER_18]: our official marching orders from DESE.

799
01:27:27,602 --> 01:27:29,122
[SPEAKER_18]: But it's not going to be optional.

800
01:27:29,582 --> 01:27:33,583
[SPEAKER_18]: So this is something that will be happening district wide.

801
01:27:34,303 --> 01:27:48,267
[SPEAKER_18]: And so it's it's not something I don't anticipate teachers saying I am not going to be screening or passing out or completing the screener.

802
01:27:48,587 --> 01:27:49,687
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not going to be an option.

803
01:27:49,947 --> 01:27:51,088
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not talking about the screener.

804
01:27:51,108 --> 01:27:51,148
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

805
01:27:52,366 --> 01:27:59,150
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I didn't need the screeners to know that my four-year-old wasn't going to be able to read when he got to kindergarten.

806
01:28:00,191 --> 01:28:01,472
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't need that.

807
01:28:03,033 --> 01:28:04,314
[SPEAKER_12]: He could remember the book.

808
01:28:04,434 --> 01:28:05,294
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why he could read.

809
01:28:05,374 --> 01:28:06,475
[SPEAKER_12]: But he could never actually read.

810
01:28:07,656 --> 01:28:15,701
[SPEAKER_12]: And his kindergarten teacher sort of made the inappropriate, not following the rules, said, you should get a neuropsych.

811
01:28:15,881 --> 01:28:17,902
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't typically do it until first or second grade.

812
01:28:17,942 --> 01:28:21,245
[SPEAKER_12]: But whispered in my ear that it should be done.

813
01:28:22,807 --> 01:28:29,050
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm glad she did, but the school's first time deciding he should get a neuropsych was second grade, I think, second or third.

814
01:28:31,132 --> 01:28:46,020
[SPEAKER_12]: My point is just figuring out which kids need services is one thing, but if the staff is incapable or disinterested or not up to par to do it,

815
01:28:48,510 --> 01:28:51,652
[SPEAKER_12]: Because what I've heard about phonics is it is so damn boring.

816
01:28:52,033 --> 01:28:56,556
[SPEAKER_12]: My son complains when he comes home because he has phonics and he loves his phonics teacher.

817
01:28:58,077 --> 01:28:59,618
[SPEAKER_12]: But he's like, oh, it's so boring.

818
01:29:00,939 --> 01:29:04,281
[SPEAKER_12]: And I wouldn't want to teach it day in and day out to a classroom full of kids who are bored.

819
01:29:04,602 --> 01:29:05,042
[SPEAKER_12]: I get it.

820
01:29:05,442 --> 01:29:08,044
[SPEAKER_12]: But it needs to not be a choice.

821
01:29:08,665 --> 01:29:09,145
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.

822
01:29:09,365 --> 01:29:17,271
[SPEAKER_00]: And fidelity to any program we choose can sometimes be an obstacle, even if you just look at any elementary program.

823
01:29:18,135 --> 01:29:29,282
[SPEAKER_00]: One way that we check for fidelity to any program, including to implement something for phonics, is a collective effort.

824
01:29:30,262 --> 01:29:46,272
[SPEAKER_00]: It's with doing, you know, walkthroughs, having dedicated time, take a block schedule, for example, at the elementary level, knowing that during these 30 minutes this will be taught, check-ins, and feedback with the teachers to see what's working and what's not, because they often,

825
01:29:47,219 --> 01:29:50,821
[SPEAKER_00]: can really, we can get over some obstacles that may be the deterrent.

826
01:29:51,121 --> 01:29:58,906
[SPEAKER_00]: So a united front, when we choose any program, which I have done in the past, is huge.

827
01:29:59,006 --> 01:30:11,894
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're right, if you, sometimes you just put something out there, and it's not, people aren't trained properly, and there isn't that motivation to do it, and then there isn't that check-in, that can happen.

828
01:30:12,395 --> 01:30:27,706
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can assure you that should we move forward with the intervention resources, that we will be a collective front as a district with that, including part of the evaluation process is the curriculum, and that would be a piece as well.

829
01:30:27,986 --> 01:30:36,572
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if that answers all of your questions, but I certainly hear what you're saying, and what I've heard from a lot of teachers through

830
01:30:37,130 --> 01:30:42,553
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of the work I've been doing at the committees at the elementary level is the desire for that as well.

831
01:30:42,613 --> 01:30:45,255
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I'm not sure that resistance will be there as much.

832
01:30:46,155 --> 01:30:49,857
[SPEAKER_00]: It might, but we will certainly, it's not the first time we've overcome that.

833
01:30:50,337 --> 01:30:53,439
[SPEAKER_00]: And our staff really does, you know, want what's best for the students.

834
01:30:53,499 --> 01:30:56,841
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I believe collectively it will be done.

835
01:30:57,121 --> 01:30:58,122
[SPEAKER_00]: Did that answer your question?

836
01:30:58,162 --> 01:31:05,366
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and I just want to say, I also respect that my understanding is virtually no teaching schools actually teach this to the teachers anymore.

837
01:31:05,931 --> 01:31:16,240
[SPEAKER_12]: So, like, for the teachers, like, they need to be really taught how to do it from scratch, it sounds like, for a lot of teachers.

838
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:24,887
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I mean, I don't mean to suggest that it's, like, just some simple thing they don't want to do and let those kids fail, but... They need to be supported as well.

839
01:31:24,907 --> 01:31:26,208
[SPEAKER_00]: They need a lot of support.

840
01:31:26,228 --> 01:31:26,568
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, 100%.

841
01:31:26,628 --> 01:31:28,570
[SPEAKER_18]: And receive quality professional development.

842
01:31:28,630 --> 01:31:28,910
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

843
01:31:29,311 --> 01:31:30,231
[SPEAKER_12]: Ongoing, really.

844
01:31:30,411 --> 01:31:30,552
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

845
01:31:33,103 --> 01:31:33,823
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Benedetto.

846
01:31:34,104 --> 01:31:34,504
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

847
01:31:34,604 --> 01:31:35,684
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a few questions.

848
01:31:35,804 --> 01:31:53,914
[SPEAKER_08]: First of all, I'm wondering if the task force next steps, if the task force can contact the Andover Public School, look at what they're currently doing based on the information we received tonight, and see what screenings they're using, how much they're paying for it, like all of those connections.

849
01:31:54,054 --> 01:31:55,115
[SPEAKER_08]: I would appreciate that.

850
01:31:55,215 --> 01:32:00,258
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe even reach out to the landmark program and see what they can have to offer us.

851
01:32:01,072 --> 01:32:02,072
[SPEAKER_00]: can definitely reach out.

852
01:32:02,773 --> 01:32:05,754
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where my children are in school, so I'll have no problem doing that.

853
01:32:06,094 --> 01:32:06,874
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

854
01:32:07,174 --> 01:32:17,558
[SPEAKER_08]: And I want to know why the kindergartners aren't being tested until later in the school year, when we know that even testing them before they come would be the best idea.

855
01:32:17,638 --> 01:32:22,980
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would like to do that as their kindergarten screenings happen, because we do screen them.

856
01:32:23,020 --> 01:32:23,720
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it then.

857
01:32:25,748 --> 01:32:26,849
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have one point, Ms.

858
01:32:26,869 --> 01:32:44,461
[SPEAKER_00]: Campbell may want to speak more, may be able to speak more eloquently than me, than I about this, but my understanding from the Shaywitz is there's a little bit more of that personal time with the student before you can assess, but, and I think that was what, why the delay is in winter, but I will let her explain that.

859
01:32:44,482 --> 01:32:53,248
[SPEAKER_08]: Before you answer that, why are we using an assessment that doesn't assess the student's needs, and it just answers questions to the teachers?

860
01:32:53,388 --> 01:32:54,889
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want that type of assessment.

861
01:32:55,222 --> 01:32:59,085
[SPEAKER_08]: I want the assessment so we do it once and we know what the student need is.

862
01:32:59,225 --> 01:33:01,887
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want it to have two steps.

863
01:33:02,327 --> 01:33:10,734
[SPEAKER_08]: So speaking on that piece isn't what I really, I don't think is the direction from what I've learned this evening as the future for us.

864
01:33:11,634 --> 01:33:19,140
[SPEAKER_08]: But again, I'm not a PhD and I don't know this and I know you guys are the educators and have that information and background.

865
01:33:20,064 --> 01:33:21,385
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't want to be redundant.

866
01:33:21,405 --> 01:33:24,146
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to answer questions that a teacher just gets an idea.

867
01:33:24,186 --> 01:33:25,346
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to know.

868
01:33:25,626 --> 01:33:31,568
[SPEAKER_18]: So we need to determine who is at risk and who is not at risk in regards to even what Dr. Garb shared.

869
01:33:32,169 --> 01:33:37,591
[SPEAKER_18]: Her platform currently isn't available while it's still being tested.

870
01:33:38,071 --> 01:33:46,174
[SPEAKER_18]: So again, in the absence of having nothing in place, by at least adopting a screener to at least let us rule in and rule out

871
01:33:47,104 --> 01:33:48,446
[SPEAKER_18]: Teachers haven't been trained yet.

872
01:33:50,228 --> 01:33:57,715
[SPEAKER_18]: And the Shaywitz, although it's not perfect, it is something that is being used to let you know who is at risk and who is not at risk.

873
01:33:57,995 --> 01:34:06,123
[SPEAKER_18]: So once you're able to at least identify those students, then you can start giving them additional supports where that wasn't happening before.

874
01:34:06,183 --> 01:34:10,508
[SPEAKER_18]: So we weren't even able to identify students early on.

875
01:34:11,577 --> 01:34:31,890
[SPEAKER_08]: I get your point, Superintendent, and I have great respect for your academic knowledge and base, but the doctor suggested there are eight or nine programs that she could recommend that are available right now, and rather than buy two programs, I would really rather invest our money right into what we need for our students.

876
01:34:32,551 --> 01:34:40,116
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, maybe you both could speak a little bit more on that so I learn more, but that's the direction I see from what I've learned this evening,

877
01:34:42,590 --> 01:34:47,534
[SPEAKER_18]: My only hesitation would be if we go down the financial path.

878
01:34:48,132 --> 01:34:59,977
[SPEAKER_18]: and a year from now DESE gives a different mandate and says that as a state, the state of Massachusetts needs to follow X programming, then we're going to be required to make that shift.

879
01:35:00,477 --> 01:35:03,199
[SPEAKER_18]: So I just want to put that out as well.

880
01:35:03,399 --> 01:35:05,380
[SPEAKER_08]: But we're buying this right now.

881
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:10,442
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, but this is like a modest investment, I would say, very modest.

882
01:35:11,002 --> 01:35:15,184
[SPEAKER_18]: And so you have the modest level and you have the Mercedes-Benz.

883
01:35:15,783 --> 01:35:20,686
[SPEAKER_18]: And if you want to spend top dollar for a program, yes, it will work.

884
01:35:20,706 --> 01:35:25,909
[SPEAKER_18]: But if DESE ends up giving us a different charge, then we're going to have to invest again.

885
01:35:26,550 --> 01:35:35,896
[SPEAKER_18]: Again, this is to put something in place while we're waiting one more year to get an official marching orders from DESE.

886
01:35:36,316 --> 01:35:41,519
[SPEAKER_18]: But at least we're screening to be able to rule in who's at risk and to rule out.

887
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:42,920
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

888
01:35:43,864 --> 01:35:52,886
[SPEAKER_08]: My only point is with that, do we know that the cost difference between one of those eight programs and this program is significant?

889
01:35:53,246 --> 01:35:54,527
[SPEAKER_07]: And how much are we talking?

890
01:35:54,547 --> 01:35:59,208
[SPEAKER_07]: One of them would be about $7.20 per student as opposed to $1.25 per student.

891
01:35:59,308 --> 01:36:06,629
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of them requires a lot of expensive professional development to get up and running, and one of them is very modest, about $300 per webinar.

892
01:36:07,910 --> 01:36:09,090
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a big difference.

893
01:36:10,925 --> 01:36:26,528
[SPEAKER_08]: So I also look at the long-term piece and how, like, if we know early and we can remediate services early, then you need less services long time, and that actually saves us money as a district when you're looking at the big picture.

894
01:36:26,968 --> 01:36:30,229
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, I'm hesitant for a quick fix.

895
01:36:30,449 --> 01:36:37,211
[SPEAKER_08]: I know DESE hasn't made their choices and it's hard to invest in things, but I just don't want to throw $1.07 away per kid.

896
01:36:40,787 --> 01:36:45,750
[SPEAKER_08]: in a year's time of intervention that to me is worth the money.

897
01:36:46,030 --> 01:36:47,111
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if it fits in our budget.

898
01:36:47,151 --> 01:36:48,752
[SPEAKER_18]: But the students will receive.

899
01:36:48,772 --> 01:37:03,460
[SPEAKER_18]: I feel like where there's maybe misunderstanding is once the screener takes place and we are able to identify students who are definitely at risk, the students that are at risk are going to receive immediate

900
01:37:04,071 --> 01:37:11,515
[SPEAKER_18]: support and interventions to start working with the deficit, the gap that's there.

901
01:37:12,055 --> 01:37:18,299
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's not like once they're identified, we just say, oh, well, you're identified.

902
01:37:18,319 --> 01:37:19,219
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I didn't think that.

903
01:37:19,960 --> 01:37:28,324
[SPEAKER_08]: But I just felt like the other one, the other assessment would clearly identify like there's four different areas in a child's area

904
01:37:28,789 --> 01:37:41,293
[SPEAKER_08]: that needs direction, the other one would identify the right area to work with, with the child, whereas the other one is just a general, oh yeah, you need help, but you don't know where to actually help, you know what I mean?

905
01:37:41,573 --> 01:37:43,994
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, where the weakness is.

906
01:37:44,014 --> 01:37:45,895
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there'd be more work after.

907
01:37:46,155 --> 01:37:48,296
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe we could just have a cost analysis.

908
01:37:48,316 --> 01:37:57,619
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that that's reasonable, and also the length of time that, if we're thinking about our early childhood children, how long we're going to be screening them.

909
01:37:58,346 --> 01:38:00,867
[SPEAKER_18]: or putting them through the test.

910
01:38:01,707 --> 01:38:07,509
[SPEAKER_18]: And so we have to just think about the length of some of these assessments, how much time it's going to take.

911
01:38:07,649 --> 01:38:10,010
[SPEAKER_18]: It needs to be administered usually one-on-one.

912
01:38:10,810 --> 01:38:18,513
[SPEAKER_18]: So that is something while the teacher or a designated person is administering the test, then someone else is teaching the students.

913
01:38:18,973 --> 01:38:24,015
[SPEAKER_18]: So if you have 20 students and if it's something that's 10 minutes, okay.

914
01:38:24,115 --> 01:38:26,336
[SPEAKER_18]: But if it's something that ends up taking an hour or so,

915
01:38:27,014 --> 01:38:28,155
[SPEAKER_18]: kids do get tired.

916
01:38:28,455 --> 01:38:33,620
[SPEAKER_18]: So there are a lot of factors that I think have to be taken into consideration.

917
01:38:34,741 --> 01:38:35,441
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

918
01:38:35,461 --> 01:38:36,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Mustone, did you have a question?

919
01:38:36,843 --> 01:38:50,655
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a point, just for clarification, if Dr. Cobb, so out of the nine screenings that you had said that you would recommend to us, out of the 90 screenings that are available, is this one of them, the Shaywitz?

920
01:38:50,715 --> 01:38:50,915
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

921
01:38:51,195 --> 01:38:52,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, great.

922
01:38:53,125 --> 01:39:02,229
[SPEAKER_02]: So the problem people have with that is that it's not directly assessing the child and that teachers can have really strong biases.

923
01:39:02,269 --> 01:39:11,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if I don't want all these kids being assessed and have additional work in my classroom, I'll just answer the questions accordingly.

924
01:39:12,313 --> 01:39:15,614
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it has very low sensitivity and specificity.

925
01:39:16,674 --> 01:39:19,155
[SPEAKER_02]: There are I'm happy to help there.

926
01:39:19,175 --> 01:39:44,760
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some there are domestic dispensers and there are the low-level ones and there are some between I think that would also work and they're 10-15 minutes, so it doesn't have to be the Alexia Rapids said that currently the So could I make a motion that we hold off on purchasing Shay wits until we see if there's another I

927
01:39:45,763 --> 01:39:46,523
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a motion?

928
01:39:46,583 --> 01:39:47,284
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a second?

929
01:39:49,126 --> 01:39:49,846
[SPEAKER_06]: Second on the floor.

930
01:39:49,886 --> 01:39:50,627
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

931
01:39:50,647 --> 01:39:51,888
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

932
01:39:51,968 --> 01:39:52,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

933
01:39:55,211 --> 01:39:57,173
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Ruggiero, unless it's a point of information.

934
01:39:57,393 --> 01:39:57,553
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

935
01:39:57,713 --> 01:39:58,314
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Ruggiero.

936
01:39:58,654 --> 01:39:59,035
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

937
01:39:59,976 --> 01:40:06,802
[SPEAKER_17]: So currently at the Roberts, can you tell me how many students have IEPs based on dyslexia right now?

938
01:40:10,037 --> 01:40:13,199
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't tell you off the top of my head how many are specific learning needs.

939
01:40:13,319 --> 01:40:16,961
[SPEAKER_17]: And is this for all the elementary schools?

940
01:40:17,021 --> 01:40:18,282
[SPEAKER_14]: Would you have a rough sense?

941
01:40:19,083 --> 01:40:20,564
[SPEAKER_17]: Would you have a ballpark figure?

942
01:40:21,304 --> 01:40:23,385
[SPEAKER_14]: For how many students in the district have IEPs?

943
01:40:23,425 --> 01:40:25,827
[SPEAKER_14]: And how many people have the diagnosis of dyslexia?

944
01:40:25,847 --> 01:40:27,028
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I don't know off the top of my head.

945
01:40:28,163 --> 01:40:31,886
[SPEAKER_17]: So let's add that to the report as well, please.

946
01:40:32,206 --> 01:40:45,917
[SPEAKER_14]: You're also kind of asking two different questions because you're saying dyslexia synonymously with specific learning disability, which kind of can encapsulate a number of different areas of weakness.

947
01:40:46,478 --> 01:40:55,465
[SPEAKER_14]: So asking for the number of kids in the district with diagnoses of dyslexia and asking for the number of students with specific learning disabilities are two different numbers.

948
01:40:56,897 --> 01:40:57,998
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, yeah, I understand that.

949
01:40:58,138 --> 01:41:00,699
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, it just seems back of the envelope, right?

950
01:41:00,799 --> 01:41:03,700
[SPEAKER_17]: So we have around 2,000 kids in our elementary school.

951
01:41:04,280 --> 01:41:10,983
[SPEAKER_17]: So we know, at least based on the research, what we've heard, that's about 200 kids that are suffering with it right now.

952
01:41:11,644 --> 01:41:18,547
[SPEAKER_17]: So, I mean, the question is, I would like to know, how many of those kids have educational plans in place right now?

953
01:41:19,307 --> 01:41:20,888
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think that this... For dyslexia.

954
01:41:21,128 --> 01:41:22,709
[SPEAKER_14]: For dyslexia, yes, please.

955
01:41:23,149 --> 01:41:25,010
[SPEAKER_14]: For a specific learning disability in reading.

956
01:41:25,748 --> 01:41:35,590
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, that's right, because that's what we're, the idea here is trying to address this issue, just making sure that we know where we're at, because I'm getting a sense that maybe we don't.

957
01:41:36,131 --> 01:41:45,633
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I also want to just point out that the screen art is for everyone, and it's not just a special education, it's not a special education initiative.

958
01:41:45,653 --> 01:41:46,473
[SPEAKER_12]: Right, right, of course.

959
01:41:46,773 --> 01:41:47,513
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I understand.

960
01:41:49,094 --> 01:41:49,674
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Russo.

961
01:41:50,334 --> 01:41:54,695
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, so I realize we are going to

962
01:41:55,450 --> 01:41:57,291
[SPEAKER_12]: wait until we get a better cost analysis.

963
01:41:57,411 --> 01:42:03,174
[SPEAKER_12]: But regardless of which screener we end up going with, the interventions are no different.

964
01:42:03,934 --> 01:42:06,636
[SPEAKER_12]: And those are the actually really expensive thing.

965
01:42:07,496 --> 01:42:16,160
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I mean, $7 per student sounds like a lot more than $1 per student, but there's 300 kindergartners.

966
01:42:16,741 --> 01:42:23,344
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not, I mean, not that much money, although I realize professional development may make that number look tiny.

967
01:42:23,624 --> 01:42:24,985
[SPEAKER_12]: But these numbers per student,

968
01:42:25,939 --> 01:42:28,000
[SPEAKER_12]: per year or per time they're assessed?

969
01:42:28,521 --> 01:42:29,621
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I know a lot of tests are done.

970
01:42:29,641 --> 01:42:32,503
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a subscription per student per year, yes.

971
01:42:32,643 --> 01:42:32,923
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

972
01:42:33,243 --> 01:42:35,945
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's not like we sink the money and we could use it forever.

973
01:42:36,585 --> 01:42:37,366
[SPEAKER_12]: It's every year.

974
01:42:37,526 --> 01:42:37,966
[SPEAKER_12]: One shot.

975
01:42:37,986 --> 01:42:38,706
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

976
01:42:39,087 --> 01:42:39,407
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

977
01:42:40,948 --> 01:42:41,268
[SPEAKER_06]: All righty.

978
01:42:42,213 --> 01:42:44,315
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much for all of this information.

979
01:42:44,935 --> 01:42:45,376
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, too.

980
01:42:45,396 --> 01:42:46,056
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Dr. Goddard.

981
01:42:46,256 --> 01:42:46,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

982
01:42:47,397 --> 01:42:47,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

983
01:42:47,758 --> 01:42:52,122
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, it's a motion to receive this report and place it on file by Ms.

984
01:42:52,142 --> 01:42:54,964
[SPEAKER_06]: Vanderhood, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

985
01:42:55,204 --> 01:42:55,985
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

986
01:42:56,966 --> 01:42:57,686
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

987
01:42:58,367 --> 01:42:59,088
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

988
01:43:00,909 --> 01:43:01,510
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

989
01:43:03,932 --> 01:43:06,654
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to revert to the regular order of business by Ms.

990
01:43:06,674 --> 01:43:08,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Stone, seconded by Ms.

991
01:43:08,115 --> 01:43:08,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Kreatz.

992
01:43:08,656 --> 01:43:09,336
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

993
01:43:10,410 --> 01:43:11,171
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

994
01:43:11,811 --> 01:43:13,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Superintendent's update and comments.

995
01:43:15,613 --> 01:43:16,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Madam Superintendent.

996
01:43:19,116 --> 01:43:22,298
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I wanted to say welcome spring.

997
01:43:23,599 --> 01:43:32,724
[SPEAKER_18]: Although the weather hasn't really been fully cooperative this past month, spring sports are active and back up and running.

998
01:43:33,385 --> 01:43:35,206
[SPEAKER_18]: Spring concerts are in full swing.

999
01:43:35,886 --> 01:43:38,008
[SPEAKER_18]: And the Medford Family Network has released

1000
01:43:38,769 --> 01:43:43,012
[SPEAKER_18]: their annual traveling playground schedule, which begins this month.

1001
01:43:44,373 --> 01:43:50,738
[SPEAKER_18]: Time is also counting down for our seniors, and they will be graduating this year on June 5th.

1002
01:43:50,998 --> 01:43:54,901
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's a countdown for our seniors.

1003
01:43:54,941 --> 01:43:59,244
[SPEAKER_18]: Last week, or the past few weeks, we've been quite busy in Medford.

1004
01:44:00,565 --> 01:44:07,811
[SPEAKER_18]: Last week we had our middle school lottery, which took place last Tuesday at the library in the high school.

1005
01:44:09,674 --> 01:44:23,193
[SPEAKER_18]: And as I've always stated, that I do believe that we are one Medford, one district, and that both middle schools are going to offer our students a quality education.

1006
01:44:24,161 --> 01:44:35,389
[SPEAKER_18]: And so having said that, both middle schools will be offering orientation sessions, welcome houses, I should say, welcome sessions for families.

1007
01:44:36,029 --> 01:44:43,995
[SPEAKER_18]: So this week, actually, on Wednesday, from 6 to 8 p.m., Wednesday, May 8th, the Andrews School

1008
01:44:44,591 --> 01:44:48,132
[SPEAKER_18]: will be hosting their welcome orientation for families.

1009
01:44:48,972 --> 01:45:00,956
[SPEAKER_18]: And next week, on Tuesday, May 14th, the McGlynn Middle School will also be hosting their welcome orientation session for families from six to eight p.m.

1010
01:45:01,857 --> 01:45:08,039
[SPEAKER_18]: I did receive a lot of questions as to why both schools were not happening on the same exact day.

1011
01:45:08,679 --> 01:45:11,800
[SPEAKER_18]: And it is because, from a parking perspective,

1012
01:45:12,389 --> 01:45:14,830
[SPEAKER_18]: both schools being located on the same campus.

1013
01:45:15,371 --> 01:45:27,558
[SPEAKER_18]: When you have large events, we do encounter serious parking challenges, so that was why we separated the welcome sessions.

1014
01:45:28,902 --> 01:45:36,705
[SPEAKER_18]: But I do look forward to being at both welcome sessions and welcoming and greeting families at both schools.

1015
01:45:37,806 --> 01:45:45,429
[SPEAKER_18]: And I want to say that although the system was not a perfect system, it's moving us a step closer.

1016
01:45:46,629 --> 01:45:52,912
[SPEAKER_18]: I've said before that my core values are ACE, academic achievement for all, collaboration for all.

1017
01:45:53,348 --> 01:45:58,133
[SPEAKER_18]: and equity for all, and my hope is that we are continuing to move in that direction.

1018
01:45:59,334 --> 01:46:08,062
[SPEAKER_18]: When we did have the lottery, we had Douglas Thorpe, who was a CPA from the firm of Johnson O'Connor in Wakefield.

1019
01:46:08,982 --> 01:46:17,525
[SPEAKER_18]: He organized and produced the lottery numbers, and he brought a team along with him, another colleague that helped.

1020
01:46:17,885 --> 01:46:32,911
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to especially thank my colleagues from the district who really helped to make the lottery happen, and I want to recognize Dr. Bernadette Riccadeli, our Director of Curriculum and Instruction.

1021
01:46:32,931 --> 01:46:36,152
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to recognize my Associate Superintendent,

1022
01:46:37,032 --> 01:46:37,233
[SPEAKER_18]: Ms.

1023
01:46:37,253 --> 01:46:44,743
[SPEAKER_18]: Diane Caldwell for supporting the event, Headmaster DeLeva, and Mr. Paul Textera, our Director of EL.

1024
01:46:46,274 --> 01:46:54,756
[SPEAKER_18]: who supported us with looking at our numbers and trying to make this as equitable a process as possible.

1025
01:46:55,396 --> 01:47:03,337
[SPEAKER_18]: I also want to say and send out a very special thank you to Kim Miles, who's in our district, is in our data department.

1026
01:47:03,917 --> 01:47:11,539
[SPEAKER_18]: She truly put in a lot of extra work and worked really hard and tirelessly on that project.

1027
01:47:11,779 --> 01:47:13,019
[SPEAKER_18]: So thank you to all of you.

1028
01:47:14,850 --> 01:47:22,052
[SPEAKER_18]: I also want to just let the community know and let you know that spring brings us back to our Walk to School Wednesdays.

1029
01:47:23,092 --> 01:47:28,353
[SPEAKER_18]: And I know that both the Columbus and Roberts schools are participating in that event.

1030
01:47:29,653 --> 01:47:34,694
[SPEAKER_18]: It's important that our students are encouraged to walk and commute safely to school.

1031
01:47:35,374 --> 01:47:43,236
[SPEAKER_18]: It also helps to bring our community together to shed light on the need for increased road safety around school campuses

1032
01:47:43,876 --> 01:47:46,478
[SPEAKER_18]: as well as promoting a healthy lifestyle.

1033
01:47:47,239 --> 01:47:55,985
[SPEAKER_18]: I know that Mayor Burke joined the Columbus School last Wednesday, and I will be joining some schools later in the month as well.

1034
01:47:58,231 --> 01:48:08,034
[SPEAKER_18]: Again, on this Wednesday, May 8th, all of our elementary schools will be hosting open houses for our incoming kindergarten students.

1035
01:48:08,955 --> 01:48:16,797
[SPEAKER_18]: And the open houses will be held from 2 to 3 o'clock this Wednesday, May 8th.

1036
01:48:17,478 --> 01:48:24,780
[SPEAKER_18]: Last Friday at the high school, Medford High School hosted a wonderful job fair where over 200

1037
01:48:27,990 --> 01:48:34,995
[SPEAKER_18]: job opportunities for our Medford High School students and our Medford Vocational Technical High School students got to meet with employers.

1038
01:48:35,015 --> 01:48:40,919
[SPEAKER_18]: And I just want to thank the employers that were there during this job fair and recognize them.

1039
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:48,745
[SPEAKER_18]: TURC, which is Information Technology, it's a paid student internship, Medford's after school program,

1040
01:48:49,465 --> 01:49:18,219
[SPEAKER_18]: the Charles River Canoe and Kayak, Market Basket, Members Plus Credit Union, Malden YMCA, Boston Area YMCA, Panera Bread, Dunkin' Donuts, Yavner Dental, Stop and Shop, Panda Express, Kelly's Roast Beef, Goldilocks Bagels, Diano's Pasta, Wegmans, Armstrong Ambulance, Nike Outlet,

1041
01:49:18,752 --> 01:49:23,596
[SPEAKER_18]: Century Bank, Medford's Department of Public Works, and Whole Foods.

1042
01:49:24,476 --> 01:49:35,605
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to recognize them because the employers were able to interview students right on the spot, and we appreciate the members of our business community and our nonprofit community

1043
01:49:36,172 --> 01:49:40,256
[SPEAKER_18]: that took the time out to meet with our students and give them an opportunity.

1044
01:49:40,857 --> 01:49:50,146
[SPEAKER_18]: I also want to send out a special thank you to Mr. Joel Menasha of our guidance department for organizing this important youth event.

1045
01:49:52,678 --> 01:50:06,248
[SPEAKER_18]: Last weekend, Retta Smith, who's our district's nutritionist, and some of our CCSR students put together benches to establish an outdoor classroom area in the inner courtyard.

1046
01:50:06,348 --> 01:50:12,732
[SPEAKER_18]: So next time you're at the high school, if you're walking through the breezeway or you want to go out and see some beautiful benches.

1047
01:50:13,193 --> 01:50:18,717
[SPEAKER_18]: So we do have an area now that's designated as an outdoor classroom with appropriate seating.

1048
01:50:19,113 --> 01:50:30,959
[SPEAKER_18]: And so we're hoping now that teachers will be able to really take advantage of that and have enough space, comfortable seating for their students to enjoy the outdoors and continue learning.

1049
01:50:31,319 --> 01:50:37,863
[SPEAKER_18]: So I want to thank Mrs. Smith and the CCSR students for stepping forward on that initiative.

1050
01:50:39,548 --> 01:50:44,970
[SPEAKER_18]: On an academic side of the house, in AP Calculus, students in Ms.

1051
01:50:44,990 --> 01:50:58,974
[SPEAKER_18]: Barbara Chen's class were asked to construct a three-dimensional, a 3D model of a solid figure with a known cross-section and then determine the volume of the solid for their fourth quarter project.

1052
01:51:00,274 --> 01:51:02,715
[SPEAKER_18]: One application in Integral Calculus

1053
01:51:03,180 --> 01:51:07,322
[SPEAKER_18]: is to approximate the volume of a solid with a known cross-section.

1054
01:51:08,002 --> 01:51:17,066
[SPEAKER_18]: The cross-section can be a square, a rectangle, an isosceles triangle, an equilateral triangle, or a semicircle.

1055
01:51:17,847 --> 01:51:24,990
[SPEAKER_18]: This solid is sitting on an enclosed region which is perpendicular to either the x-axis or the y-axis.

1056
01:51:25,730 --> 01:51:31,153
[SPEAKER_18]: The project helped the students visually see the actual solid, not imagination.

1057
01:51:31,926 --> 01:51:36,890
[SPEAKER_18]: the students had the opportunity to practice the proper use of calculus notations.

1058
01:51:37,350 --> 01:51:42,934
[SPEAKER_18]: They applied and connected important concepts, such as the fundamental theorem of calculus and limits.

1059
01:51:43,735 --> 01:51:51,621
[SPEAKER_18]: The students were able to transfer their learning from geometry class, the area of formulas, into definite integral.

1060
01:51:52,422 --> 01:51:59,447
[SPEAKER_18]: So calculating the volume of the solid, and photos of this activity can be found on our blog.

1061
01:52:01,500 --> 01:52:14,509
[SPEAKER_18]: just again to let the community know that this week does begin the start of Ramadan for our Muslim community neighbors and we would like to wish them a happy Ramadan season or Ramadan Mubarak.

1062
01:52:16,931 --> 01:52:23,195
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, last Wednesday, we had a group of students go to Day on the Hill.

1063
01:52:23,775 --> 01:52:28,779
[SPEAKER_18]: The teacher that led that activity was Mr. Joe Donlan.

1064
01:52:29,502 --> 01:52:35,285
[SPEAKER_18]: We had two school committee members attend with our students, member Kathy Krutz and Paul Russo.

1065
01:52:35,805 --> 01:52:56,156
[SPEAKER_18]: The students got to meet our representatives, Representative Barber, Sean Garberly, Paul Donato, and it was about 10 students, and they were able to tour and spend time in the chamber, and it was a wonderful learning experience, and I thank you, the school committee members, for continuing to support

1066
01:52:56,983 --> 01:53:06,372
[SPEAKER_18]: the school district, not only here at our formal meetings, but constantly coming out to support us and support the children during their learning.

1067
01:53:07,648 --> 01:53:16,812
[SPEAKER_18]: Additionally, last Thursday we had an Italy Culture Day at the district, and again, Cassett hosted that.

1068
01:53:16,972 --> 01:53:23,575
[SPEAKER_18]: We had the honor of having Deputy Consul General Emilia Luciani come with members.

1069
01:53:25,255 --> 01:53:31,838
[SPEAKER_18]: We had the current president of Cassett, Anne-Marie Cugno, who was there, many other members.

1070
01:53:31,898 --> 01:53:36,060
[SPEAKER_18]: Representative Paul Donato did come out to support the event.

1071
01:53:36,980 --> 01:53:39,201
[SPEAKER_18]: We had school committee member Ms.

1072
01:53:39,221 --> 01:53:40,562
[SPEAKER_18]: Paulette Vanderkloot there.

1073
01:53:41,282 --> 01:53:47,185
[SPEAKER_18]: And at that event, we had Italian musicians who sang.

1074
01:53:47,985 --> 01:53:49,386
[SPEAKER_18]: We had opera singers.

1075
01:53:50,246 --> 01:53:54,748
[SPEAKER_18]: We had an Italian chef where students had the opportunity to make pasta.

1076
01:53:56,409 --> 01:54:07,286
[SPEAKER_18]: and you also had an opportunity to go and see a virtual tour of Italy where you put on goggles and you got to hop on a, I actually went to Rome.

1077
01:54:07,788 --> 01:54:13,754
[SPEAKER_18]: a mini trip, I was on a Vesper, and you could turn your head around, and it was a wonderful learning experience.

1078
01:54:13,794 --> 01:54:25,066
[SPEAKER_18]: The kids were really excited, and we had a few hundred students who were able to be in the Karen Theater, and many administrators participated.

1079
01:54:25,446 --> 01:54:31,032
[SPEAKER_18]: We also had the opportunity to learn some authentic Italian dance or folk dance.

1080
01:54:31,581 --> 01:54:40,964
[SPEAKER_18]: folklore dance from different regions, and so that was a lot of fun, and it was a wonderful opportunity to celebrate the Italian culture.

1081
01:54:42,545 --> 01:54:50,207
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, last Friday was a wonderful, wonderful packed event that took place at the Bistro.

1082
01:54:50,976 --> 01:54:57,400
[SPEAKER_18]: And this was our CCSR, our Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility gathering.

1083
01:54:58,060 --> 01:55:04,944
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to recognize Mr. Skorka and Mr. Richard Trotter for hosting this dinner.

1084
01:55:05,424 --> 01:55:17,991
[SPEAKER_18]: We were thanking the Cummings Foundation for their continued financial contribution for the Crystal Campbell Betterment

1085
01:55:19,485 --> 01:55:21,967
[SPEAKER_18]: community betterment project.

1086
01:55:23,589 --> 01:55:25,991
[SPEAKER_18]: They were representatives there as well.

1087
01:55:26,772 --> 01:55:36,660
[SPEAKER_18]: And we had, I think there were definitely over 150 people, and we had additional people inside the little room off of the bistro.

1088
01:55:37,021 --> 01:55:41,004
[SPEAKER_18]: But it was a great time, raffles, food, festivities.

1089
01:55:41,925 --> 01:55:44,948
[SPEAKER_18]: And so I want to just thank school committee members

1090
01:55:45,348 --> 01:55:48,791
[SPEAKER_18]: Kathy Krutz, Paul Lusso, Erinda Benedetto, and Ms.

1091
01:55:48,811 --> 01:55:54,336
[SPEAKER_18]: Paulette Van der Kloot, and Mayor Burke was there as well, supporting that wonderful event.

1092
01:55:54,656 --> 01:56:08,968
[SPEAKER_18]: We continue to celebrate the wonderful 3D sidewalk at the Brooks School, which has received so much national recognition, and we're very proud of what our students continue to do with CCSR.

1093
01:56:11,968 --> 01:56:30,481
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, I would like to say this past Saturday at the West Medford Community Center, I'd like to thank them for inviting me and for inviting all of you, the school committee members coming out on a Saturday, Mayor Burke, all of our city council members as well, to really engage with the community.

1094
01:56:31,402 --> 01:56:34,204
[SPEAKER_18]: It was a crowded space and I do see

1095
01:56:36,454 --> 01:56:36,634
[SPEAKER_18]: Ms.

1096
01:56:36,674 --> 01:56:59,265
[SPEAKER_18]: Melanie McLaughlin, she was there as well, one of the parents, CPAC representative there as well, and we had Senator Jalen and Representative Barber, who was there as well, and it was, the two hours went by, two hours plus went by very quickly, but it was a wonderful community engagement event.

1097
01:56:59,706 --> 01:57:02,127
[SPEAKER_18]: So thank you, and those are my announcements for this week.

1098
01:57:02,407 --> 01:57:02,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.

1099
01:57:03,588 --> 01:57:03,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

1100
01:57:03,868 --> 01:57:04,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Vandekloot.

1101
01:57:06,215 --> 01:57:10,040
[SPEAKER_11]: First, I also would like to give a shout out to Nicole Chin.

1102
01:57:10,700 --> 01:57:23,956
[SPEAKER_11]: Nicole was the CCSR student who really organized that dinner on Friday night, and she and her devoted parents did such a wonderful job pulling that event together, and I think everybody had a great time.

1103
01:57:24,420 --> 01:57:32,245
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was great to celebrate the students as well as to see those senior students who received $500 scholarships.

1104
01:57:33,086 --> 01:57:34,447
[SPEAKER_11]: So it was a great, great night.

1105
01:57:35,007 --> 01:57:41,871
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to go back to the beginning where you talked about the middle school lottery, Superintendent, if I could.

1106
01:57:42,071 --> 01:57:42,252
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1107
01:57:43,402 --> 01:57:46,664
[SPEAKER_11]: So I sort of have two different sort of series of questions.

1108
01:57:47,164 --> 01:57:52,608
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's important to look back at the process and say what worked well, what didn't.

1109
01:57:53,529 --> 01:58:01,774
[SPEAKER_11]: And so in reflecting on that, I was curious how much the outside CPA firm cost and whether it was worth it.

1110
01:58:02,094 --> 01:58:04,896
[SPEAKER_11]: And if we were to do it again, whether we would need an outside firm?

1111
01:58:08,778 --> 01:58:10,439
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't remember the actual

1112
01:58:11,741 --> 01:58:11,941
[SPEAKER_18]: Ms.

1113
01:58:11,981 --> 01:58:14,603
[SPEAKER_18]: Dr. Riccadeli, could you come forward to tell us?

1114
01:58:24,990 --> 01:58:25,290
[SPEAKER_18]: It cost $1,100.

1115
01:58:25,550 --> 01:58:25,930
[SPEAKER_18]: $1,100, thank you.

1116
01:58:26,090 --> 01:58:26,611
[SPEAKER_11]: Was it worth it?

1117
01:58:26,691 --> 01:58:28,332
[SPEAKER_11]: If we did it again, would we need it?

1118
01:58:29,032 --> 01:58:39,199
[SPEAKER_18]: I think having gone through it this first time, I feel that we really would be able to do it independently ourselves.

1119
01:58:41,721 --> 01:58:52,166
[SPEAKER_18]: Because of the level of complexity and where we had the special categories, we really just wanted to make sure that we kind of

1120
01:58:52,910 --> 01:58:56,891
[SPEAKER_18]: stuck to the rules and we wanted it to be as fair a process as possible.

1121
01:58:57,231 --> 01:58:58,831
[SPEAKER_11]: And I absolutely understand that.

1122
01:58:58,891 --> 01:59:06,092
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to know, and it was important to create a baseline of making sure that it was transparent and clear and whatever.

1123
01:59:06,532 --> 01:59:14,454
[SPEAKER_11]: But of course, having said that, I'm sure others have received, too, discussion from parents still asking, is there another way?

1124
01:59:14,974 --> 01:59:16,454
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that it's important now.

1125
01:59:16,534 --> 01:59:19,255
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that in the time that you came in,

1126
01:59:21,855 --> 01:59:30,817
[SPEAKER_11]: and did a quick evaluation and say, this year this is the best way to do it, that we didn't really afford the timetable.

1127
01:59:30,837 --> 01:59:36,698
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think it's important now to take a step back and to say, is there another way?

1128
01:59:36,978 --> 01:59:44,800
[SPEAKER_11]: Does it make sense for all the 6th graders to be in one place and divide up the 7th or 8th grade class so that they all know each other?

1129
01:59:45,405 --> 01:59:50,588
[SPEAKER_18]: I appreciate you saying that because I've received a lot of emails as well.

1130
01:59:51,429 --> 01:59:57,993
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think for this year that this was what we could do to take a first step.

1131
01:59:59,694 --> 02:00:08,620
[SPEAKER_18]: There has been a lot of questions about could we do a more thorough, a more robust feasibility study.

1132
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:10,862
[SPEAKER_18]: And so although we had the original

1133
02:00:13,973 --> 02:00:17,174
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, based strictly on numbers that it was a no.

1134
02:00:18,194 --> 02:00:26,037
[SPEAKER_18]: One of my most recent emails was, is it possible just to do 6th grade and then again split up 7th and 8th?

1135
02:00:26,597 --> 02:00:37,801
[SPEAKER_18]: So we are definitely open to trying to come up with a solution that would be fair to all and at the same time

1136
02:00:38,413 --> 02:00:41,694
[SPEAKER_18]: continue to let the students have access to one another.

1137
02:00:42,194 --> 02:00:49,037
[SPEAKER_18]: Again, I truly believe in our rich diversity here in Medford, and we can build upon that and learn upon that.

1138
02:00:49,397 --> 02:00:50,878
[SPEAKER_18]: That's one of our greatest strengths.

1139
02:00:51,598 --> 02:00:59,181
[SPEAKER_18]: And truly, if I had the magic wand, I would have just had everyone move together.

1140
02:00:59,781 --> 02:01:07,764
[SPEAKER_18]: So we are committed to doing the feasibility study and taking it very seriously to look at the footprint

1141
02:01:08,411 --> 02:01:20,474
[SPEAKER_18]: of both schools, you know, from recommendations of moving the McGlynn School Elementary into the Andrews Building and making the entire McGlynn complex become a 678.

1142
02:01:20,534 --> 02:01:26,535
[SPEAKER_18]: So there have been a lot of different ideas that have been put forward.

1143
02:01:26,895 --> 02:01:32,317
[SPEAKER_18]: So by doing a feasibility study, we can really find out what are the capacities of the building.

1144
02:01:34,031 --> 02:01:37,614
[SPEAKER_18]: If there is another solution, what would the cost be?

1145
02:01:37,694 --> 02:01:43,538
[SPEAKER_18]: What are the things that would need to happen if we were to, you know, reconfigure the space?

1146
02:01:43,618 --> 02:01:44,639
[SPEAKER_18]: What would the cost be?

1147
02:01:44,899 --> 02:01:51,324
[SPEAKER_18]: And kind of do a cost-benefit analysis to say, well, this is what the result could be.

1148
02:01:51,705 --> 02:01:58,850
[SPEAKER_11]: I always feel the urge, though, as we discuss this, and I very much would like to see that feasibility study, and that's the reason why I'm bringing it up tonight.

1149
02:01:59,431 --> 02:02:03,574
[SPEAKER_11]: And it doesn't sound like I need to make a motion because it seems like it's clearly part

1150
02:02:04,255 --> 02:02:09,320
[SPEAKER_11]: your direction, but of course I want the school committee member to be very much involved with the discussion.

1151
02:02:09,340 --> 02:02:23,212
[SPEAKER_11]: But I do, I always think that just from a historical perspective, it's very important that the community realize that the reason why we built the two schools in the way that we did was that because it enabled us to get 90% funding from the state.

1152
02:02:25,414 --> 02:02:32,021
[SPEAKER_11]: And so the cost of our buildings, these magnificent buildings, was a very small cost.

1153
02:02:32,221 --> 02:02:38,307
[SPEAKER_11]: And as I always have listened to other districts and heard when someone came and talked to me today about what's going on in their district,

1154
02:02:38,680 --> 02:02:43,164
[SPEAKER_11]: And I said, well, how much is the state going to be able to contribute?

1155
02:02:43,464 --> 02:02:45,265
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was opposite.

1156
02:02:45,325 --> 02:02:46,587
[SPEAKER_11]: It was like 10%, you know.

1157
02:02:47,007 --> 02:02:55,814
[SPEAKER_11]: And that is why we ended up with the K to 8 in one building in the middle school, 6th, 7th, and 8th.

1158
02:02:56,114 --> 02:02:58,897
[SPEAKER_11]: But now many years have passed, and it's time to take a look at it.

1159
02:02:59,197 --> 02:02:59,377
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1160
02:03:00,058 --> 02:03:00,458
[SPEAKER_18]: I agree.

1161
02:03:00,478 --> 02:03:02,840
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1162
02:03:03,260 --> 02:03:03,560
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1163
02:03:06,224 --> 02:03:14,328
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so we are moving on to item number six, recommendation to approve donation to Andrews Middle School Drama Club.

1164
02:03:14,828 --> 02:03:14,988
[SPEAKER_16]: Ms.

1165
02:03:15,028 --> 02:03:15,488
[SPEAKER_16]: Caldwell.

1166
02:03:17,989 --> 02:03:24,152
I hope that was the Italian reading that we had.

1167
02:03:25,152 --> 02:03:26,253
First of all, I think that

1168
02:03:34,717 --> 02:03:35,478
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a team.

1169
02:03:35,618 --> 02:03:38,261
[SPEAKER_11]: But did you get up and dance?

1170
02:03:38,761 --> 02:03:42,946
[SPEAKER_13]: That was Dr. Vincent doing the dancing with the kids.

1171
02:03:54,264 --> 02:04:01,010
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just want to thank the Fitzpatrick family for making a donation of $150 to this year's musical.

1172
02:04:01,531 --> 02:04:04,714
[SPEAKER_13]: And the donation will go towards the cost associated with the musical.

1173
02:04:04,774 --> 02:04:05,975
[SPEAKER_13]: So we want to thank the family.

1174
02:04:06,616 --> 02:04:07,336
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to accept.

1175
02:04:07,597 --> 02:04:07,997
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1176
02:04:08,017 --> 02:04:08,317
[SPEAKER_11]: Second.

1177
02:04:09,078 --> 02:04:09,318
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

1178
02:04:10,539 --> 02:04:11,861
[SPEAKER_11]: Call it, Kathy.

1179
02:04:12,181 --> 02:04:12,441
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, OK.

1180
02:04:12,501 --> 02:04:13,222
[SPEAKER_11]: All in favor.

1181
02:04:13,809 --> 02:04:14,890
[SPEAKER_11]: No, you have to do it, it's money.

1182
02:04:14,910 --> 02:04:16,751
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, okay, okay.

1183
02:04:16,991 --> 02:04:19,173
[SPEAKER_16]: So roll call vote, Madam Secretary.

1184
02:04:21,874 --> 02:04:22,155
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1185
02:04:26,217 --> 02:04:26,477
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1186
02:04:31,801 --> 02:04:34,543
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, great.

1187
02:04:34,963 --> 02:04:40,927
[SPEAKER_16]: Moving on to number seven, follow-up report on fundraising organizations and student activity accounts.

1188
02:04:41,467 --> 02:04:43,449
[SPEAKER_16]: Emily Lazzaro and Mary Jo Petrone.

1189
02:04:50,345 --> 02:04:53,266
[SPEAKER_15]: So this is a follow-up report that you have in your packets.

1190
02:04:53,926 --> 02:04:55,686
[SPEAKER_15]: It's updated with the most recent numbers.

1191
02:04:55,806 --> 02:05:01,647
[SPEAKER_15]: We pulled the numbers from Mary Jo's accounts on Friday.

1192
02:05:02,627 --> 02:05:06,508
[SPEAKER_15]: So this is everything is up to date as of now for the student activities accounts.

1193
02:05:06,608 --> 02:05:07,788
[SPEAKER_15]: And Ms.

1194
02:05:07,808 --> 02:05:13,889
[SPEAKER_15]: DiBenedetto requested that it be on the agenda so we can field any questions you all have.

1195
02:05:15,989 --> 02:05:16,770
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1196
02:05:20,780 --> 02:05:21,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much.

1197
02:05:22,241 --> 02:05:25,362
[SPEAKER_08]: I know this has been a big project and a lot of work.

1198
02:05:26,683 --> 02:05:32,266
[SPEAKER_08]: But something I noticed when I'm looking at these accounts, there are areas that I don't see.

1199
02:05:32,486 --> 02:05:33,606
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see football.

1200
02:05:33,726 --> 02:05:34,987
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see boys hockey.

1201
02:05:35,067 --> 02:05:36,087
[SPEAKER_08]: We have girls hockey.

1202
02:05:36,548 --> 02:05:41,370
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see boys baseball or boys soccer, but we have some of the girls teams.

1203
02:05:42,050 --> 02:05:43,631
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't know why

1204
02:05:44,204 --> 02:05:47,332
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like all activity accounts aren't listed?

1205
02:05:47,492 --> 02:05:48,856
[SPEAKER_08]: That's more of my question.

1206
02:05:48,976 --> 02:05:50,580
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not even sure if you can answer that.

1207
02:05:51,641 --> 02:06:07,845
[SPEAKER_10]: So in my benefit as student activity person, anyone that comes to me and asks if they can deposit funds into the student activity account for the benefit of a team or student activity, I'm more than happy to take their money and deposit it for them.

1208
02:06:08,185 --> 02:06:13,427
[SPEAKER_10]: However, they have to follow the rules that the state has put into place, and Ms.

1209
02:06:13,787 --> 02:06:20,649
[SPEAKER_10]: Patterson and the superintendent, and that means that every activity that comes through, I look at an invoice,

1210
02:06:21,565 --> 02:06:25,148
[SPEAKER_10]: I reimburse for only activities that are related to students.

1211
02:06:26,029 --> 02:06:31,694
[SPEAKER_10]: And so not everyone wants to play with those rules, so they choose not to do that.

1212
02:06:32,755 --> 02:06:35,477
[SPEAKER_10]: But I don't choose who comes into student activities.

1213
02:06:35,857 --> 02:06:40,441
[SPEAKER_10]: I accept all people into student activities that would like to join me.

1214
02:06:40,842 --> 02:06:43,384
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm very inclusive, but they have to follow the rules.

1215
02:06:44,004 --> 02:06:45,646
[SPEAKER_08]: So a little bit of history.

1216
02:06:46,146 --> 02:06:49,169
[SPEAKER_08]: Many years ago, before I was a school committee member,

1217
02:06:50,140 --> 02:07:18,928
[SPEAKER_08]: there was a question with the student activities account, and at that time, I believe, either when I first got on or right before I first got on, and maybe Member Bandicoot can help me with this memory, is that all student activity accounts were supposed to go and be registered through the high school accounts, and all of these should be listed here, and all money's deposited and processed in that manner.

1218
02:07:19,289 --> 02:07:26,516
[SPEAKER_08]: I know the Medford High School PTO at that time had their account in that manner because I was on.

1219
02:07:26,856 --> 02:07:33,983
[SPEAKER_10]: PTOs are no longer acceptable into student activities because they manage items outside of student activities.

1220
02:07:34,043 --> 02:07:34,263
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

1221
02:07:34,483 --> 02:07:44,573
[SPEAKER_10]: So all PTOs, when this new ruling, when Pat Valley was here and the state updated their rules and regulations after some issues that occurred in other districts, not here in Medford,

1222
02:07:45,774 --> 02:07:49,897
[SPEAKER_10]: the new rules and regulations said all PTOs had all their money had to be pulled out.

1223
02:07:50,517 --> 02:07:56,301
[SPEAKER_10]: All class money has to go out by the end of December of the year following their graduation.

1224
02:07:56,321 --> 02:08:00,665
[SPEAKER_10]: We used to hold the class money and then they would get in touch with me when they were having a reunion.

1225
02:08:01,125 --> 02:08:05,048
[SPEAKER_10]: We can't hold class money anymore because they're not students anymore.

1226
02:08:05,708 --> 02:08:11,913
[SPEAKER_08]: So does that mean like a lot of the ones that aren't listed here may be under a 5013C or a not?

1227
02:08:15,481 --> 02:08:41,618
[SPEAKER_08]: non-profit group like, you know, the Friends of accounts and aren't those programs, like we made a motion here about two years ago that those accounts also had to register because they're using MedFed's name and MedFed students to raise money and they were supposed to by September 1st, I believe, or October 1st of this year,

1228
02:08:42,082 --> 02:08:43,463
[SPEAKER_08]: be on this list?

1229
02:08:43,783 --> 02:08:44,883
[SPEAKER_15]: So this is a different list.

1230
02:08:44,943 --> 02:08:46,464
[SPEAKER_15]: This is not the 501c3s.

1231
02:08:46,504 --> 02:08:46,784
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

1232
02:08:46,864 --> 02:08:48,965
[SPEAKER_15]: I presented last time on the 501c3s that are registered.

1233
02:08:48,985 --> 02:08:49,205
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1234
02:08:49,265 --> 02:08:50,065
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm confusing the two.

1235
02:08:50,305 --> 02:08:56,108
[SPEAKER_15]: This was a follow-up just because, yeah, the request was, so we see the 501c3s.

1236
02:08:56,168 --> 02:08:57,128
[SPEAKER_15]: What about the student activities?

1237
02:08:57,168 --> 02:08:58,829
[SPEAKER_15]: And we said, OK, we'll give you the student activities.

1238
02:08:58,849 --> 02:09:00,270
[SPEAKER_15]: So this is the rest of them.

1239
02:09:00,690 --> 02:09:04,832
[SPEAKER_15]: So we have, in a separate document, the 501c3s.

1240
02:09:04,992 --> 02:09:05,712
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we have this.

1241
02:09:05,892 --> 02:09:10,194
[SPEAKER_15]: And the organizations that are neither, we can't keep track of them.

1242
02:09:11,294 --> 02:09:16,258
[SPEAKER_15]: because they're not something that we're aware of, unless they tell us.

1243
02:09:17,919 --> 02:09:25,564
[SPEAKER_15]: But even then, we have no jurisdiction over them, so they can kind of just collect money and use it the way they want to, unfortunately.

1244
02:09:25,644 --> 02:09:27,085
[SPEAKER_15]: We can't really, we can't track them down.

1245
02:09:27,526 --> 02:09:30,488
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so my last question, and it might be a mix of both.

1246
02:09:30,788 --> 02:09:40,375
[SPEAKER_08]: So say I see on Facebook that a certain group is having a camp up at our community schools through the summer, and it's, you know,

1247
02:09:40,717 --> 02:09:44,680
[SPEAKER_08]: It has MedFed name on the camp, and they're running it.

1248
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,542
[SPEAKER_08]: Does that money go through community schools?

1249
02:09:47,602 --> 02:09:49,984
[SPEAKER_08]: Does that go through student activities?

1250
02:09:50,384 --> 02:09:54,147
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just not clear on how we're doing this.

1251
02:09:54,247 --> 02:09:59,331
[SPEAKER_08]: Or do they just rent space from us, and they get to charge people at the door?

1252
02:10:01,092 --> 02:10:08,538
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no clarity and accountability for how all this money is coming and going, and that's what I'm afraid of.

1253
02:10:09,073 --> 02:10:17,198
[SPEAKER_08]: Not that I believe that people are doing something wrong, but when money's passing hands, there is temptation there.

1254
02:10:17,338 --> 02:10:28,525
[SPEAKER_08]: And if the school district is, if they're utilizing our buildings, we need to be paid for that, so that way we can provide heat and electric and paper towels and those type of products while they're there.

1255
02:10:29,165 --> 02:10:33,668
[SPEAKER_08]: And we know, for liability's sake as well, who's in our building when,

1256
02:10:34,888 --> 02:10:35,989
[SPEAKER_08]: Are they our employees?

1257
02:10:36,109 --> 02:10:37,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Are they renting our facilities?

1258
02:10:37,790 --> 02:10:40,492
[SPEAKER_08]: We're liable in a lot of these situations.

1259
02:10:41,032 --> 02:10:48,117
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if someone were to get hurt and we don't know, that's really scary too.

1260
02:10:48,317 --> 02:10:49,577
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's a lot.

1261
02:10:50,871 --> 02:10:52,732
[SPEAKER_08]: trying to figure out this puzzle piece.

1262
02:10:52,932 --> 02:10:53,912
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's really what I'm looking for.

1263
02:10:53,972 --> 02:10:57,054
[SPEAKER_10]: So between Emily and I, we would have nothing to do with camps.

1264
02:10:57,794 --> 02:10:58,975
[SPEAKER_10]: Or community schools.

1265
02:10:59,075 --> 02:10:59,975
[SPEAKER_10]: Or community schools.

1266
02:11:00,515 --> 02:11:04,757
[SPEAKER_10]: So the list that you have is just what Medford High School has on hand.

1267
02:11:05,337 --> 02:11:08,719
[SPEAKER_10]: I also have the other schools, which only have one account per school.

1268
02:11:09,679 --> 02:11:15,241
[SPEAKER_10]: There are wonderful programs that are run through the community schools, but we would not be the right people to answer that question.

1269
02:11:16,902 --> 02:11:18,583
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for providing this list.

1270
02:11:20,264 --> 02:11:27,987
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe we could make a motion to have, at some point, maybe in the fall, like a look at this.

1271
02:11:28,187 --> 02:11:46,633
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at how money is going through community schools, how money goes through student activity accounts, and how money goes through, you know, friends, and what we know about it, and how we want that structured so we make sure that we're following all guidelines and that things are done.

1272
02:11:47,473 --> 02:11:49,394
[SPEAKER_08]: In a real way, you know,

1273
02:11:49,975 --> 02:12:02,101
[SPEAKER_08]: in what our responsibility is as a school district as far as liability when they're in our building, if they're renting it from us, as opposed to running the group through us.

1274
02:12:03,442 --> 02:12:08,344
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's just been involved for a long time and some clarity would be great.

1275
02:12:09,085 --> 02:12:11,786
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'd like to make a motion for that for early fall.

1276
02:12:12,546 --> 02:12:14,908
[SPEAKER_08]: And thank you very much for your time in presenting this.

1277
02:12:17,309 --> 02:12:18,069
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there a second?

1278
02:12:18,089 --> 02:12:19,530
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a motion.

1279
02:12:21,532 --> 02:12:38,603
[SPEAKER_08]: To look at these three different venues, community schools, the friends of, and student activities and how money goes in and out of each and how we're tracking that system, if there's a better way that we need to look at this.

1280
02:12:40,605 --> 02:12:43,847
[SPEAKER_08]: And we can send it to a subcommittee or something, but it's just...

1281
02:12:45,425 --> 02:12:47,166
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of usage in different ways.

1282
02:12:47,826 --> 02:12:51,807
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's other things, too, like when we rent our buildings.

1283
02:12:52,247 --> 02:13:06,951
[SPEAKER_08]: If a rental is using our building and they're using more space than they're renting, and if they're going into classrooms and taking people's things, or utilizing things that are in the building when they're not supposed to, those type of things.

1284
02:13:07,731 --> 02:13:09,552
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we just need to look at this

1285
02:13:10,643 --> 02:13:14,785
[SPEAKER_08]: like whole picture of what we're doing.

1286
02:13:15,265 --> 02:13:19,107
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Russo, and then Ms.

1287
02:13:19,127 --> 02:13:19,567
[SPEAKER_12]: Van der Kloot.

1288
02:13:19,947 --> 02:13:39,557
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I mean, thinking back to when we passed the policy around the registration of organizations, one of the things that I think is part of what Member DiVenedetto was trying to get at is, you know, we lack a single scheduling system for the district's properties.

1289
02:13:41,468 --> 02:13:59,899
[SPEAKER_12]: And so, therefore, we don't know if some group is using a room, are they paying market rate that we have set, or are they getting a, my buddy let me register the room because I know them, or are they actually a club at the school and we're not going to charge them.

1290
02:14:00,039 --> 02:14:10,065
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, like all of our properties, every single one of the rooms and spaces that are being used by somebody

1291
02:14:11,365 --> 02:14:18,851
[SPEAKER_12]: clubs, 501C3s, community schools, any sports teams that's not on any of these lists.

1292
02:14:20,232 --> 02:14:22,634
[SPEAKER_12]: It should all be on the up and up exactly.

1293
02:14:22,694 --> 02:14:23,435
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's renting it?

1294
02:14:23,515 --> 02:14:24,616
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's the contact?

1295
02:14:25,557 --> 02:14:27,438
[SPEAKER_12]: What are they paying, if anything?

1296
02:14:27,959 --> 02:14:31,141
[SPEAKER_12]: Where is the money going that they're paying, if they are paying?

1297
02:14:31,561 --> 02:14:36,025
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just don't feel like that is clear, because there is no one scheduling system.

1298
02:14:36,085 --> 02:14:39,548
[SPEAKER_12]: My last count, there were five scheduling systems for our school system.

1299
02:14:40,854 --> 02:14:48,598
[SPEAKER_12]: So I can go right now to the Columbus Elementary School, and it will show that not one part of that school is being used this week.

1300
02:14:49,239 --> 02:14:50,500
[SPEAKER_12]: And I can tell you that's not true.

1301
02:14:52,661 --> 02:14:54,642
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's no one master schedule.

1302
02:14:54,662 --> 02:14:56,343
[SPEAKER_12]: We have all the different sports things.

1303
02:14:57,624 --> 02:15:02,867
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Maloney has to do a year ahead of time for the sports, which I totally respect and understand.

1304
02:15:03,227 --> 02:15:07,309
[SPEAKER_12]: But that scheduling goes into one thing and not into the other systems.

1305
02:15:07,649 --> 02:15:08,870
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just a complete mess.

1306
02:15:11,237 --> 02:15:23,685
[SPEAKER_12]: that doesn't seem like anybody has used their authority to simply say, okay, we're going to normalize on a single system, whether you like it or not, and if there's duplicative data entry, then that's somebody's job.

1307
02:15:25,426 --> 02:15:28,207
[SPEAKER_12]: But right now, there is nothing, and that's really what we have.

1308
02:15:28,728 --> 02:15:28,868
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

1309
02:15:28,908 --> 02:15:29,148
[SPEAKER_09]: Patterson?

1310
02:15:29,168 --> 02:15:29,848
[SPEAKER_09]: To the chair, yes.

1311
02:15:29,909 --> 02:15:30,029
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1312
02:15:30,489 --> 02:15:36,873
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I respectfully disagree with that, that we do have district-wide scheduling.

1313
02:15:37,073 --> 02:15:40,295
[SPEAKER_09]: We have provided that in a large scale for every

1314
02:15:40,825 --> 02:15:45,347
[SPEAKER_09]: activity that is chargeable that we have that go through our coffers.

1315
02:15:45,787 --> 02:15:48,668
[SPEAKER_09]: Friends of is not part of our jurisdiction.

1316
02:15:49,088 --> 02:15:59,252
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything that is done through building rental, we do identify different categories based on if they are in-house, non-profit, whether they are school-based activities.

1317
02:15:59,352 --> 02:16:09,417
[SPEAKER_09]: So those types of activities may not be incorporated under the sports calendar, but would be part of what the building principals would be identifying.

1318
02:16:09,517 --> 02:16:10,557
[SPEAKER_09]: And if it's chargeable,

1319
02:16:10,981 --> 02:16:17,786
[SPEAKER_09]: And then that goes through the community schools and or another program if that's what the intent was.

1320
02:16:18,146 --> 02:16:21,309
[SPEAKER_09]: But again, we have provided this documentation in the past.

1321
02:16:21,649 --> 02:16:28,894
[SPEAKER_09]: We've provided the extensive report of the revenue in and the expenditures out for each of these revolving programs.

1322
02:16:29,695 --> 02:16:37,601
[SPEAKER_09]: So I do respect that there still may be some confusion, but I am happy again to provide

1323
02:16:39,656 --> 02:16:47,422
[SPEAKER_09]: the details of all of these programs and what we've brought in to the extent that we have the ins and outs in a given year.

1324
02:16:48,003 --> 02:17:04,275
[SPEAKER_12]: But if there's transparency, then anybody at home right now should be able to go to a single calendar off of a website from Medford Public Schools and look up any single space that can be reserved, and they will see who's in it, when, how much they paid, where the money went.

1325
02:17:05,116 --> 02:17:08,859
[SPEAKER_12]: And right now, there are whole buildings that if I went to one calendar,

1326
02:17:09,229 --> 02:17:11,230
[SPEAKER_12]: They seem to be completely available and free.

1327
02:17:11,951 --> 02:17:15,113
[SPEAKER_12]: And then you go to another calendar, and maybe there is scheduling information there.

1328
02:17:15,393 --> 02:17:20,656
[SPEAKER_09]: So it may be the parameters that the calendars are being shared out.

1329
02:17:21,096 --> 02:17:24,499
[SPEAKER_09]: So we can certainly request that through Ms.

1330
02:17:24,519 --> 02:17:31,623
[SPEAKER_09]: Rachel Perry, who does all of the building calendars, to ensure that those are being shared appropriately district-wide.

1331
02:17:32,003 --> 02:17:34,685
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that effort is taking place.

1332
02:17:35,426 --> 02:17:37,667
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything that is being reported

1333
02:17:38,748 --> 02:17:41,971
[SPEAKER_09]: to her for posting that is being included on that.

1334
02:17:42,031 --> 02:17:54,540
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, it might be a communication issue that we need to work with our building principals if they know that something is going in their building that's not being charged on a larger scale, per se.

1335
02:17:54,700 --> 02:17:59,784
[SPEAKER_12]: Like Miss Kay at the Columbus wants to say, yes, the PTO can have a meeting in the library tonight.

1336
02:18:01,946 --> 02:18:03,627
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not charging the PTO for that.

1337
02:18:03,647 --> 02:18:04,047
[SPEAKER_12]: That's fine.

1338
02:18:06,880 --> 02:18:12,561
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't make sense that then she has to contact Rachel Perry, who will then put it on her calendar, that that's going to happen.

1339
02:18:12,901 --> 02:18:18,042
[SPEAKER_12]: It makes sense that Miss Kay goes into the calendar, because she's the master of her calendar.

1340
02:18:18,522 --> 02:18:18,863
[SPEAKER_11]: Correct.

1341
02:18:19,023 --> 02:18:19,843
[SPEAKER_12]: And puts it in.

1342
02:18:20,403 --> 02:18:22,203
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's one calendar that says both.

1343
02:18:22,243 --> 02:18:23,984
[SPEAKER_12]: Right now, I went on the calendar.

1344
02:18:24,004 --> 02:18:27,044
[SPEAKER_12]: It says Greater Boston League of something, something.

1345
02:18:27,484 --> 02:18:30,205
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm like, that was the sports calendar.

1346
02:18:32,465 --> 02:18:34,146
[SPEAKER_12]: There are multiple calendars still.

1347
02:18:35,680 --> 02:18:54,735
[SPEAKER_12]: that will list all of the properties, but the building people will be using one, the sports folks are using another, and so there's no calendar that shows you what's going on in our district, and that's, if you think there is, I would like to know where it is, because I looked.

1348
02:18:55,555 --> 02:19:04,382
[SPEAKER_09]: Then we can certainly communicate with those that are posting the information and ensure that that's going out appropriately, because we do have

1349
02:19:05,341 --> 02:19:11,486
[SPEAKER_09]: some of these tools available that we are utilizing now, if they're not being maximized, then that's something that we need to address.

1350
02:19:12,106 --> 02:19:18,130
[SPEAKER_12]: And in the fall when we met, there were five calendar systems, and that was this past fall still.

1351
02:19:18,370 --> 02:19:22,894
[SPEAKER_12]: So unless somebody has decommissioned the other four, there are still five.

1352
02:19:24,535 --> 02:19:26,196
[SPEAKER_12]: That's that.

1353
02:19:26,596 --> 02:19:29,118
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, that's not really... We can work on that.

1354
02:19:30,099 --> 02:19:30,539
[SPEAKER_12]: That'd be good.

1355
02:19:32,096 --> 02:19:33,838
[SPEAKER_12]: get it down to one.

1356
02:19:34,599 --> 02:19:35,380
[SPEAKER_18]: If it can be one.

1357
02:19:35,500 --> 02:19:39,404
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know the parameters of all of them, but we don't need to have five.

1358
02:19:39,525 --> 02:19:47,354
[SPEAKER_18]: So hopefully we can get it down to less than five and try to understand why the calendars aren't talking to one another.

1359
02:19:48,415 --> 02:19:49,957
[SPEAKER_18]: So I can definitely work on that.

1360
02:19:50,778 --> 02:19:50,998
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1361
02:19:52,307 --> 02:19:52,587
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1362
02:19:52,627 --> 02:19:52,767
[SPEAKER_16]: Ms.

1363
02:19:52,808 --> 02:19:53,748
[SPEAKER_16]: Russell, is that okay?

1364
02:19:53,788 --> 02:19:53,989
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1365
02:19:54,069 --> 02:19:54,329
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1366
02:19:54,689 --> 02:19:55,010
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1367
02:19:55,330 --> 02:19:55,610
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

1368
02:19:55,650 --> 02:19:56,091
[SPEAKER_11]: Vendicott.

1369
02:19:57,051 --> 02:20:04,678
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I feel like I'm a little confused because I think we're mixing a lot of different things in that there's different issues here.

1370
02:20:05,079 --> 02:20:09,503
[SPEAKER_11]: Paul, you're raising the question of the calendar scheduling.

1371
02:20:10,824 --> 02:20:15,388
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that the tie-in was where is the money going?

1372
02:20:15,789 --> 02:20:17,090
[SPEAKER_11]: But we have received

1373
02:20:18,079 --> 02:20:19,620
[SPEAKER_11]: reports from Christine.

1374
02:20:19,640 --> 02:20:20,841
[SPEAKER_11]: We did look at it.

1375
02:20:20,941 --> 02:20:30,087
[SPEAKER_11]: It was somewhere, I don't remember, back at some point or another, maybe it was a year ago, where we looked at it and we saw, and at that time no one had any questions about it.

1376
02:20:30,107 --> 02:20:31,407
[SPEAKER_11]: It was all detailed.

1377
02:20:32,388 --> 02:20:37,871
[SPEAKER_11]: So maybe, you know, again, we should look at what date we did that and we should do it again on a yearly basis.

1378
02:20:38,432 --> 02:20:43,015
[SPEAKER_11]: And in fact, I think that the motion at the time was that we would be doing it at a yearly basis.

1379
02:20:44,088 --> 02:20:45,990
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's sort of in one pot.

1380
02:20:47,251 --> 02:21:02,884
[SPEAKER_11]: The report that we got today was on student activity accounts, which is different, but maybe we want them side to side with the friends of, so that we can say, gee, it's interesting, girls basketball, and I'm just picking one up.

1381
02:21:03,476 --> 02:21:09,358
[SPEAKER_11]: out of the blue with, you know, has both a student activity account and it has this.

1382
02:21:10,218 --> 02:21:11,278
[SPEAKER_11]: It also is a friends of.

1383
02:21:12,339 --> 02:21:20,761
[SPEAKER_11]: It's because I think that's, Erin, what you're talking about is sort of saying, gee, there are some things that aren't listed here, which I thought they would come up with a student activity.

1384
02:21:21,121 --> 02:21:25,962
[SPEAKER_11]: No, a student activity account is different than what we talked about earlier.

1385
02:21:26,102 --> 02:21:28,463
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just, I need to make some lines.

1386
02:21:28,523 --> 02:21:31,404
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we, you know, when you throw it all into the same

1387
02:21:32,300 --> 02:21:34,202
[SPEAKER_11]: motion, it doesn't make any sense.

1388
02:21:36,104 --> 02:21:36,444
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

1389
02:21:37,445 --> 02:21:46,633
[SPEAKER_11]: So, having said that, it's... Okay.

1390
02:21:46,913 --> 02:21:47,754
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I think about it?

1391
02:21:48,234 --> 02:21:49,295
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to do it right now.

1392
02:21:50,176 --> 02:21:50,536
[SPEAKER_11]: So let's...

1393
02:21:57,321 --> 02:22:12,145
[SPEAKER_08]: to provide us with that information before the end of the school year, so we can look at different things together, and just look at them and say, how come this group is over here and we have... And I think it would add more clarity for us.

1394
02:22:12,665 --> 02:22:25,128
[SPEAKER_08]: So, instead of making a motion, just a request to have the activities account next to the friends of under the new way that they have to enroll in the friends of, and that information.

1395
02:22:25,368 --> 02:22:26,888
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, we don't have

1396
02:22:27,364 --> 02:22:29,185
[SPEAKER_09]: access to any friends of.

1397
02:22:29,785 --> 02:22:33,747
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are separate entities outside raising funds on behalf of.

1398
02:22:34,367 --> 02:22:40,430
[SPEAKER_09]: We only have the purview of our student activity accounts that are in-house collected.

1399
02:22:40,550 --> 02:22:51,015
[SPEAKER_09]: There are some organizations or teams that don't have any fundraising efforts or initiatives that we are aware of either, but we do not have

1400
02:22:52,490 --> 02:22:56,231
[SPEAKER_09]: financials in terms of friends of those groups.

1401
02:22:56,711 --> 02:23:01,492
[SPEAKER_09]: The other component were the 501c3s.

1402
02:23:01,912 --> 02:23:07,373
[SPEAKER_09]: We do not have access to that, and that's not under our purview under the regulations of the law.

1403
02:23:07,674 --> 02:23:09,734
[SPEAKER_09]: So I cannot provide that to you.

1404
02:23:10,134 --> 02:23:11,754
[SPEAKER_09]: You can review their 501c3 status based on

1405
02:23:14,736 --> 02:23:22,800
[SPEAKER_09]: what they have reported, they have to report an annual filing, but we do not have the detailed backup for those.

1406
02:23:23,060 --> 02:23:27,101
[SPEAKER_09]: We can provide what has been community schools and rentals in that capacity.

1407
02:23:27,582 --> 02:23:40,587
[SPEAKER_08]: So we had a presentation and we have a form that Emily has that groups provide their bank account information, who's running those groups, and information.

1408
02:23:40,647 --> 02:23:42,308
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the group I mean.

1409
02:23:42,739 --> 02:23:58,286
[SPEAKER_15]: So that would be, as I said when I presented in February, that will be done yearly in October, and I can pull the student activities, most updated student activities numbers as well together when I do that in October, if that's okay as an ongoing thing.

1410
02:23:58,306 --> 02:23:59,126
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can compare them.

1411
02:23:59,146 --> 02:23:59,246
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

1412
02:23:59,266 --> 02:24:01,347
[SPEAKER_08]: How many groups are listed in that right now?

1413
02:24:01,587 --> 02:24:01,967
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you remember?

1414
02:24:01,987 --> 02:24:02,888
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know off the top of my head.

1415
02:24:02,948 --> 02:24:03,788
[SPEAKER_15]: It's on a spreadsheet.

1416
02:24:04,188 --> 02:24:04,509
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1417
02:24:04,789 --> 02:24:04,969
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1418
02:24:05,209 --> 02:24:06,429
[SPEAKER_15]: Of the student activities or the...

1419
02:24:08,277 --> 02:24:12,779
[SPEAKER_11]: To my colleague, I think it would make sense if we reviewed that in October as a group.

1420
02:24:13,460 --> 02:24:15,901
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think we need to make a motion right at this point.

1421
02:24:16,101 --> 02:24:18,462
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be my suggestion.

1422
02:24:20,683 --> 02:24:22,684
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's on the calendar to do that.

1423
02:24:22,764 --> 02:24:29,888
[SPEAKER_08]: We just asked that we add the student activities at that point so we can see both that new group that you have listed.

1424
02:24:30,188 --> 02:24:34,570
[SPEAKER_08]: Because all of those groups need to do that annually

1425
02:24:34,983 --> 02:24:39,947
[SPEAKER_08]: So they have to do that by September 1st, and you'll have the information to provide to us by October 1st.

1426
02:24:40,167 --> 02:24:46,852
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, well, or if they change leadership in the beginning of the year around September 1st, we'll give them time to settle and then get the information.

1427
02:24:46,972 --> 02:24:47,192
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

1428
02:24:47,252 --> 02:24:53,396
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why we made it October, give it a month to make sure that we could compile the information and present it.

1429
02:24:53,777 --> 02:24:54,197
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1430
02:24:54,397 --> 02:24:55,418
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

1431
02:24:55,538 --> 02:24:58,200
[SPEAKER_16]: And also, Mr. DeVito gets a motion to approve.

1432
02:24:58,340 --> 02:24:59,300
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

1433
02:24:59,881 --> 02:25:00,081
[SPEAKER_16]: Ms.

1434
02:25:00,101 --> 02:25:00,942
[SPEAKER_16]: Vandeclute, are you all set?

1435
02:25:01,222 --> 02:25:01,422
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1436
02:25:01,582 --> 02:25:02,183
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

1437
02:25:02,243 --> 02:25:02,943

1438
02:25:04,656 --> 02:25:07,997
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion to enter Executive Session to deal with the legal matters?

1439
02:25:08,897 --> 02:25:11,658
[SPEAKER_17]: We still have some items left on the agenda.

1440
02:25:11,838 --> 02:25:12,799
[SPEAKER_11]: Resolutions?

1441
02:25:13,359 --> 02:25:14,239
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, excuse me.

1442
02:25:14,359 --> 02:25:20,301
[SPEAKER_16]: I just wanted to read here, we have a nice thank you note from the Ethics Board.

1443
02:25:21,050 --> 02:25:27,292
[SPEAKER_16]: It says, dear members of the school committee, thank you so much for all your support in helping us attend the National High School Ethics Bowl.

1444
02:25:27,753 --> 02:25:32,294

1450
02:25:44,031 --> 02:25:50,935
[SPEAKER_16]: some individuals for some generous donations, they're in our packet, and that brings us to the resolutions.

1451
02:25:56,199 --> 02:25:57,980
[SPEAKER_16]: So we have our resolutions.

1452
