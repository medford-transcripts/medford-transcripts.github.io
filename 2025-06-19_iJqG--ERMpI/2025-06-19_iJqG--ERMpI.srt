22
00:01:32,195 --> 00:01:33,516
[SPEAKER_01]: First question for you.

23
00:01:33,576 --> 00:01:33,796
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

24
00:01:35,037 --> 00:01:39,479
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the Mystic Players revival and how did it all get started?

25
00:01:40,393 --> 00:01:41,334
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a big question.

26
00:01:41,354 --> 00:01:43,796
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure it is.

27
00:01:43,816 --> 00:01:51,084
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mystic Players Revival is basically I kind of just came up with the idea.

28
00:01:51,344 --> 00:02:03,036
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew about the original Mystic Players and I had always like wanted to have like a theater company in Medford and

29
00:02:04,437 --> 00:02:11,880
[SPEAKER_00]: I always, you and mom and my grandparents were constantly telling me, join the Mystic Players.

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,301
[SPEAKER_00]: Go audition for the Mystic Players.

31
00:02:13,441 --> 00:02:17,082
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I finally decided to look them up, I realized they had disbanded.

32
00:02:18,703 --> 00:02:27,546
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was so bummed out about it, because it's such a great thing, having an adult community theater and all ages community theater in Medford.

33
00:02:29,067 --> 00:02:31,088
[SPEAKER_00]: And so years and years pass.

34
00:02:31,448 --> 00:02:33,529
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just one day was like,

35
00:02:34,149 --> 00:02:34,649
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?

36
00:02:34,669 --> 00:02:36,349
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna do this.

37
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:42,331
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I started a Facebook group called Bring Community Theater Back to Medford.

38
00:02:42,351 --> 00:02:46,291
[SPEAKER_00]: And I met with a bunch of wonderful people.

39
00:02:46,711 --> 00:02:49,872
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how I met Jim, Danielle, and Robert.

40
00:02:50,772 --> 00:02:54,493
[SPEAKER_00]: And we came up with the name Mystic Players Revival.

41
00:02:55,573 --> 00:02:57,573
[SPEAKER_00]: And the rest is kind of history.

42
00:02:57,613 --> 00:03:00,774
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we just, we, you know, we,

43
00:03:01,994 --> 00:03:04,635
[SPEAKER_00]: It just kind of happened.

44
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:14,918
[SPEAKER_00]: We worked really hard and it took a decent amount of time to get to where we are now.

45
00:03:18,176 --> 00:03:46,643
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like i'm explaining this so poorly um you're doing a good job just keep going you're fine um we're also like we're a non-profit organization um so we uh uh i i feel like you know jim or robert or jdl would be much better off at explaining what that means um and uh um what was i even saying we might have to cut this what was i even saying you were talking about

46
00:03:47,954 --> 00:03:49,695
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, how did it all start, Margaret?

47
00:03:49,755 --> 00:03:50,756
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.

48
00:03:51,597 --> 00:04:02,926
[SPEAKER_00]: So it started because, you know, we got together, we met up, did the Facebook group, you know, through the Facebook group, and we met in person and we came up with Mystic Players Revival.

49
00:04:03,146 --> 00:04:03,466
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

50
00:04:04,107 --> 00:04:07,409

00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:08,534
[SPEAKER_01]: So congratulations are in order for you and the team.

104
00:08:08,774 --> 00:08:10,317
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we all did so much.

105
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:18,263
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, maybe you can share what our viewers You know some of the backstory.

106
00:08:18,303 --> 00:08:21,626
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean the first show sure you put a lot of work into it.

107
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,967
[SPEAKER_01]: So how did that all come about?

108
00:08:24,147 --> 00:08:24,707
[SPEAKER_01]: Lot of work.

109
00:08:24,988 --> 00:08:28,890
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and a lot of help from the people that are in the city also

110
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:41,967
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so basically it all started with us applying for a grant through the Mass Cultural Council because anything you do with the theater world, it requires funding.

111
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:46,913
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were lucky enough to receive the grant.

112
00:08:47,914 --> 00:08:54,276
[SPEAKER_00]: And we, as soon as we got it, we just started immediately, we sat down with one another and just started planning.

113
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:58,637
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we weren't, you know, set like, we weren't like, what are we going to do?

114
00:08:58,677 --> 00:08:59,798
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we going to do a play?

115
00:08:59,818 --> 00:09:01,778
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we going to do, what are we, what's it going to be?

116
00:09:01,798 --> 00:09:05,780
[SPEAKER_00]: And we kind of decided on doing like a cabaret style show.

117
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:13,782
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was basically a bunch of songs from a bunch of different musical theater productions all put into one show.

118
00:09:17,343 --> 00:09:32,249
[SPEAKER_00]: uh you know we uh put like a call out for auditions um we reached out to all sorts of places in Medford to you know because with theater you need to hold rehearsals um we reached out to

119
00:09:33,318 --> 00:09:36,979
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly, everybody we possibly could probably annoyed some people.

120
00:09:36,999 --> 00:09:38,539
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I'm sure you did.

121
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:46,901
[SPEAKER_00]: And we, you know, got in touch, thankfully, with, I want to mention them because they've helped us tremendously.

122
00:09:46,981 --> 00:09:51,902
[SPEAKER_00]: The friends of the Chevalier board have been incredible to us.

123
00:09:52,442 --> 00:09:53,462
[SPEAKER_00]: They have helped us so much.

124
00:09:54,462 --> 00:09:57,003
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually had us perform for them.

125
00:09:59,064 --> 00:10:09,552
[SPEAKER_00]: at a board meeting, and because of that, we met so many new people, and even the mayor, she has been amazing.

126
00:10:10,133 --> 00:10:12,114
[SPEAKER_00]: She has helped us so much.

127
00:10:12,354 --> 00:10:24,764
[SPEAKER_00]: She got us in touch with the McGlynn, and a few other people as well, but at the end of the day, we got in touch with the principal at the McGlynn, we were like, hey,

128
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:26,344
[SPEAKER_00]: We really need a space.

129
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:38,169
[SPEAKER_00]: We also got in touch with Bob Maloney.

130
00:10:38,369 --> 00:10:39,970
[SPEAKER_00]: He's such a great guy.

131
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:43,491
[SPEAKER_00]: We got in touch with him about the McGlynn as well.

132
00:10:43,731 --> 00:10:50,133
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to both principal Tucci and Bob, we were able to secure the McGlynn as a space for us.

133
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,940
[SPEAKER_00]: was amazing.

134
00:10:54,241 --> 00:10:58,483
[SPEAKER_00]: And that that was just step like one of a million was getting the space.

135
00:10:58,603 --> 00:11:00,404
[SPEAKER_00]: But we held auditions.

136
00:11:01,785 --> 00:11:12,850
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always say it's funny, you know, we got so many people from all over Massachusetts, like, you know, like, some people, we even had someone come from New Hampshire and audition for audition.

137
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:13,170
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

138
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:14,651
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, Whoa, you know what I mean?

139
00:11:14,671 --> 00:11:18,133
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, we're this is our first ever show and people are already coming out and like,

140
00:11:19,239 --> 00:11:21,241
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, to just audition.

141
00:11:21,261 --> 00:11:29,850
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we held auditions, we cast the show really fast, because we were in a very short time frame.

142
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:36,356
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had all of our rehearsals, and we put on a show.

143
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:38,878
[SPEAKER_01]: And you put on a good show, you really did.

00:11:45,502 --> 00:11:49,985
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you had a lot of editions and whatever, tryouts, I don't know, but

148
00:11:50,975 --> 00:11:52,757
[SPEAKER_01]: They helped you out quite a bit.

149
00:11:52,777 --> 00:11:52,957
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

150
00:11:53,077 --> 00:11:57,702
[SPEAKER_00]: So we didn't hold auditions there, but we do do events there.

151
00:11:57,722 --> 00:12:00,644
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do an open mic type of event.

152
00:12:01,806 --> 00:12:04,788
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically it's you can come to these events.

153
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:08,052
[SPEAKER_00]: You can come prepared with a monologue, a song.

154
00:12:08,392 --> 00:12:09,993
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we have themed nights.

155
00:12:10,013 --> 00:12:11,915
[SPEAKER_00]: Like recently we just did like a, um,

156
00:12:12,736 --> 00:12:20,578
[SPEAKER_00]: We had like a missed cast thing and then we did like a comedy night thing.

157
00:12:20,798 --> 00:12:32,722
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've had like, you know, we try to like, you know, make it more fun sometimes, but people come, they do like performances and it's just like, it's what like community theater really is all about.

158
00:12:32,762 --> 00:12:37,043
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's just, you know, it brings people together and it's amazing.

159
00:12:37,764 --> 00:12:39,084
[SPEAKER_01]: And you get to see a lot of talent.

160
00:12:39,164 --> 00:12:39,424
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

161
00:12:39,484 --> 00:12:41,065
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, everyone is incredible.

162
00:12:41,225 --> 00:12:41,385
[SPEAKER_00]: So.

163
00:12:42,622 --> 00:12:48,284
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I guess, uh, there's a lot that goes on behind the scenes.

164
00:12:48,304 --> 00:12:49,524
[SPEAKER_01]: You've explained all that.

165
00:12:50,484 --> 00:12:51,825
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, excuse me.

166
00:12:51,925 --> 00:12:52,065
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

167
00:12:53,685 --> 00:12:55,086
[SPEAKER_01]: But what about casting?

168
00:12:55,846 --> 00:12:59,367
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you, you guys, you have to find directors, auditions.

169
00:13:00,007 --> 00:13:01,388
[SPEAKER_01]: How does that all come about?

170
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:11,191
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, um, sometimes luck, um, with specifically with like directors, but, um, we,

171
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:18,714
[SPEAKER_00]: Ever since our cabaret, we have made almost like a family with the people that were a part of our show.

172
00:13:19,454 --> 00:13:24,698
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of that, we had so many people that performed at our show want to direct for us.

173
00:13:25,578 --> 00:13:29,120
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we got very lucky with that.

174
00:13:29,841 --> 00:13:37,866
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've also had people, unknown people, submit their resumes and their ideas for future shows.

175
00:13:39,727 --> 00:13:57,458
[SPEAKER_00]: and uh basically we just put a call out on our instagram facebook um you know any social media our website and um for as far as you said casting um so as far as like auditions and like casting and stuff um we uh

176
00:13:58,718 --> 00:14:22,627
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a great theater forum out there called Your Theater 411 where you can post a free listing like for an audition and that's basically like everyone in New England I think uses it or you know maybe not even just New England maybe everywhere and that's how people find you and you know if they are like oh this looks interesting they can come audition.

177
00:14:22,947 --> 00:14:24,428
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they're interested in something.

178
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:25,008
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

179
00:14:25,488 --> 00:14:25,788
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

00:14:27,489 --> 00:14:27,609
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

184
00:14:27,689 --> 00:14:27,989
[SPEAKER_01]: Simple.

[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

186
00:14:28,789 --> 00:14:32,631
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wouldn't have to go to one audition if I wanted to be in one of your shows.

187
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:32,911
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a very casual show.

305
00:22:24,087 --> 00:22:27,130
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like we're just talking in the living room, you know, just chatting.

306
