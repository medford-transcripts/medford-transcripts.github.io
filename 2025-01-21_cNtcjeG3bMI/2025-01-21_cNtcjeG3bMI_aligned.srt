Medford city council committee of the whole January 21 2025 is called the order Mr. please call the roll.

2
00:08:31,306 --> 00:08:31,926
That's a Calhoun.

Vice President Collins present.

4
00:08:34,787 --> 00:08:36,808
That's a little Zorro.

5
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:38,308
That's a lemon.

6
00:08:39,008 --> 00:08:40,489
That's a script Kelly present.

7
00:08:44,551 --> 00:08:45,411
7 present, none absent.

8
00:08:45,451 --> 00:08:46,732
The meeting is called to order.

00:08:47,552 --> 00:08:55,856

10
00:08:57,457 --> 00:09:01,439

00:09:02,335 --> 00:09:08,617

00:09:56,602 --> 00:09:59,804
Respectfully submitted, Teresa DuPont, Community Preservation Act Manager.

23
00:10:01,005 --> 00:10:05,849
And I figure I can turn it over to you and we can take it in that order if that works for you.

24
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:07,791
Teresa, great.

25
00:10:08,091 --> 00:10:09,092
I'm not touching anything.

26
00:10:09,132 --> 00:10:09,552
There we go.

27
00:10:09,572 --> 00:10:10,032
The manager.

28
00:10:10,793 --> 00:10:11,253
Good evening.

29
00:10:11,293 --> 00:10:18,019
Thank you very much for your time in gathering today to hear about our fiscal 25 Community Preservation Act applications.

30
00:10:18,459 --> 00:10:26,325
I'm joined a little bit on remote on Zoom as well as some lovely folks here in the room to discuss the merit of their applications.

31
00:10:26,966 --> 00:10:27,766
I have a very brief

32
00:10:29,573 --> 00:10:41,462
presentation just to kind of kick it off to share with everybody just to kind of acquaint folks with what CPA is all about and hopefully this will work well for me.

33
00:10:45,141 --> 00:10:45,481
All right.

34
00:10:46,122 --> 00:10:50,305
So again, we're here today to talk about our fiscal 25 CPA applications annually.

35
00:10:50,705 --> 00:10:54,047
We hold an application round where folks bring their projects to us.

36
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:55,909
We weigh the applications.

37
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:57,590
This is the next step.

38
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:04,795
All of the applications that you're about to hear have been approved and recommended for funding by the CPC.

39
00:11:05,596 --> 00:11:11,200
The next step for all who are listening is for appropriation requests to be approved by this body.

40
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:14,162
Just a really quick recap on what CPA is.

41
00:11:14,742 --> 00:11:17,104
It was voted in by ballot measure in November 2015.

42
00:11:17,224 --> 00:11:20,366
We started seeing revenues generated in fiscal year 18.

43
00:11:20,526 --> 00:11:25,249
It is a 1.5% surcharge on top of your taxes.

44
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:30,192
So it's not a huge bucket of money, but every year we bring in somewhere between 1.8 and $2 million.

45
00:11:33,354 --> 00:11:34,675
some years more, some years less.

46
00:11:35,036 --> 00:11:44,123
So to date, for the first six years that we've been funding projects, around here on the bottom, we've given out about $13.2 million, reinvesting back into the community.

47
00:11:45,682 --> 00:11:48,903
So tonight, this is a very brief overview of the applications.

48
00:11:48,963 --> 00:11:51,144
There are slides that kind of go into a little bit more detail here.

49
00:11:51,924 --> 00:12:00,046
But overall, the applications that you'll be hearing tonight, Car Park Phase 2 and Riverside Plaza, those were actually already approved by this honorable body earlier.

50
00:12:00,066 --> 00:12:04,608
So you'll be hearing from the Affordable Housing Trust for their initial startup funding.

51
00:12:05,548 --> 00:12:08,549
They have none, so this is just kind of an initial seed money, if you will.

52
00:12:09,422 --> 00:12:17,586
We'll be hearing from DPW Commissioner McGivern on the Oak Grove building restoration, as well as Playset Park Tennis Courts resurfacing project.

53
00:12:18,187 --> 00:12:22,909
We'll be joined by Director Bailey to speak on the condon shell lighting improvements.

54
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:26,451
I will circle back on the council chamber window restoration.

55
00:12:26,771 --> 00:12:28,993
This is a project that this body has heard before.

56
00:12:29,873 --> 00:12:31,654
We'll explain that one when we get to that project.

57
00:12:31,674 --> 00:12:38,238
We're also joined by our community members here at the Shiloh Baptist Church for phase two of their ADA improvements.

58
00:12:39,178 --> 00:12:51,767
our friends at the Unitarian Universalist Church for exterior building restoration, some just siding work, if you will, as well as our partners at EBCD to continue the Medford Move-In program, which is a rental assistance program here in the city.

59
00:12:53,068 --> 00:12:54,909
I'm going to pause to see if there's any initial questions.

60
00:12:54,949 --> 00:13:04,676
Otherwise, I will go ahead and invite Aditi Mavor and Lisa Davidson from our housing trust to come up and speak about their project, if there were no questions.

61
00:13:06,037 --> 00:13:07,678
Any questions by members of the council at this time?

62
00:13:10,742 --> 00:13:17,607
seeing Councilor Zaro.

63
00:13:17,627 --> 00:13:21,190
I am a member of the Unitarian Universalist Church of Medford.

64
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:25,313
I think I should recuse myself from that portion of the discussion for tonight.

65
00:13:28,092 --> 00:13:28,933
I think that's fine.

66
00:13:29,994 --> 00:13:31,855
You also don't stand to benefit personally from it.

67
00:13:31,935 --> 00:13:35,578
So it's probably a mixed case, but it's fine.

68
00:13:36,038 --> 00:13:39,041
We'll just mark you present when we vote on it.

69
00:13:39,881 --> 00:13:41,022
Maybe we can sever that vote.

70
00:13:42,243 --> 00:13:45,766
And just to clarify, we're not voting on recommendations tonight, correct?

71
00:13:45,806 --> 00:13:50,629
That will be at the next regular city council or can we vote from- We're referring them to the regular meeting.

72
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:52,171
Okay, I just wanted to clarify that.

73
00:13:52,211 --> 00:13:52,451
Yeah.

74
00:13:52,491 --> 00:13:52,811
Thank you.

75
00:13:52,931 --> 00:13:53,992
It's only my second time doing this.

76
00:13:54,192 --> 00:13:55,193
No, no, you're doing great.

77
00:13:57,898 --> 00:14:00,100
Thank you, Teresa, for the brief introduction.

78
00:14:00,581 --> 00:14:02,422
Good evening, members of the City Council.

79
00:14:02,662 --> 00:14:03,563
I'm Aditi Mugur.

80
00:14:03,723 --> 00:14:05,605
I staff the Affordable Housing Trust Fund.

81
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:07,967
Joining with me this evening is Ms.

82
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:10,810
Lisa Ann Davidson, who's the chair of the trust.

83
00:14:11,331 --> 00:14:13,513
And I believe vice chair, Ms.

84
00:14:13,713 --> 00:14:21,380
Penelope Taylor is virtually present, along with Roberta Cameron, who's one of the trustees and also the CPC chairperson.

85
00:14:25,987 --> 00:14:30,028
As you may be aware, Affordable Housing Trust Fund is a newly established board.

86
00:14:31,349 --> 00:14:38,291
The ordinance to establish the Affordable Housing Trust Fund was adopted last year by the city council.

87
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:38,992
Thank you.

88
00:14:40,232 --> 00:14:47,675
We've had our first Affordable Housing Trust monthly meeting in August last year, and so far we've had six monthly meetings.

89
00:14:48,495 --> 00:14:50,437
We've made significant progress.

90
00:14:51,237 --> 00:14:58,303
The trust is developing a five-year action plan to identify the city's affordable housing needs and priorities.

91
00:14:58,983 --> 00:15:02,626
Since from October to December, the trust has

92
00:15:04,007 --> 00:15:07,888
collected housing data information and done some preliminary analysis.

93
00:15:08,308 --> 00:15:20,292
And last December and this January, the trust conducted two stakeholder engagement sessions to understand how affordable housing developers and housing stability and supportive service providers

94
00:15:22,453 --> 00:15:27,935
understand the needs and of affordable housing developments and services in the city.

95
00:15:28,855 --> 00:15:33,656
And then we plan to host a community engagement meeting in March.

96
00:15:34,297 --> 00:15:41,479
And probably in mid or late summer, we plan to have the action plan finalized.

97
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:50,787
The trust also signed the Declaration of Trust, which allows the trust to transfer or own property.

98
00:15:51,207 --> 00:15:55,171
It also outlines the various rules and regulations of the trust.

99
00:15:56,733 --> 00:16:02,158
End of this month or early Feb, we will record the Declaration of Trust at the Registry of Deeds.

100
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:10,026
Here are some project examples that the trust is thinking about.

101
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:13,450
These are not concrete projects.

102
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,272
These are just potential examples.

103
00:16:15,513 --> 00:16:23,162
As the trust finalizes the action plan, we'll have a more concrete understanding of what the projects are going to be in the next five years.

104
00:16:25,404 --> 00:16:31,845
One project example is to explore development of affordable housing on city-owned parcels.

105
00:16:32,645 --> 00:16:35,206
The trust could take two different approaches.

106
00:16:35,526 --> 00:16:47,988
One is to seek a state grant that does site feasibility and pre-development work on city-owned parcels and also helps develop a request for proposals to solicit bids.

107
00:16:48,468 --> 00:16:51,768
This is a technical assistance grant that values between $50,000 to $100,000.

108
00:16:54,969 --> 00:17:04,717
To avail this grant, the local municipality has to provide a 10% cash match, so we are hoping to use CPA funds for this.

109
00:17:05,478 --> 00:17:16,867
In case we are not successful in getting this grant, we hope to use CPA funds to do site feasibility pre-development work and solicit bids for affordable housing developments.

110
00:17:18,649 --> 00:17:32,638
Another project example is to support the construction of new affordable housing, Medford Housing Authorities, Authority Community Development Corporations, Community Housing Development Organization, which is the Medford Community Housing.

111
00:17:33,418 --> 00:17:38,922
They all have affordable housing projects, and we aim to support the construction of these projects.

112
00:17:39,962 --> 00:17:50,533
We don't have a community land trust yet, but currently we are doing a study on community land trust and we are hoping that moving forward we can support a potential land trust in its projects.

113
00:17:53,082 --> 00:17:56,964
The third example is to build a fund to purchase land.

114
00:17:57,164 --> 00:18:08,330
As I said, the declaration of trust allows the Board of Trustees to acquire and purchase land, so we're hoping that CPA funds can support this project.

115
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:17,395
The idea is to acquire privately owned parcels, and that is adjoining city-owned parcels to sort of maximize the intensity and scale of the project.

116
00:18:18,355 --> 00:18:21,377
The trust could also purchase existing affordable housing units.

117
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:29,326
A third example is to provide down payment assistance to first-time homebuyers.

118
00:18:30,507 --> 00:18:35,310
This is to support households whose income is at or below 100% AMI.

119
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:42,335
And the last potential project would be to support rental assistance programs.

120
00:18:42,435 --> 00:18:43,476
Currently, we have

121
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,531
move in Medford.

122
00:18:46,352 --> 00:19:00,187
But in the future, the trust will probably look at the existing rental assistance programs and identify what are the barriers and opportunities and may propose to redesign better rental assistance programs.

123
00:19:00,427 --> 00:19:04,952
And we hope that CPA funds can be used to support these programs.

124
00:19:08,489 --> 00:19:20,880
In addition to requesting CPA funds, the trust is looking at applying to Mass Housing Grant, as I mentioned earlier, to do some pre-development work on city-owned parcels.

125
00:19:21,721 --> 00:19:30,890
And then there's a developer payment coming through a project under Mystic Valley Development Commission.

126
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:32,731
The project is 600 Rivers Edge.

127
00:19:32,891 --> 00:19:33,672
We don't have

128
00:19:35,882 --> 00:19:40,179
We don't have it in writing yet, but there are negotiations underway.

129
00:19:41,353 --> 00:19:53,278
And we're hoping that through the zoning overhaul, we'll introduce a fractional payment as part of the inclusionary housing fee, and this could support the affordable housing trust fund.

130
00:19:53,938 --> 00:19:57,120
And lastly, the affordable housing linkage.

131
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:04,723
Once we do a next study, we hope to add affordable housing linkage as part of the existing linkage program.

132
00:20:05,063 --> 00:20:08,985
These are some of the potential funding sources that the trust is looking into.

133
00:20:12,325 --> 00:20:17,948
To sum up, this is a tentative budget breakdown of CPA funds.

134
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:25,611
The CPA funds could be used for local cash match, and then for acquisition, construction, and support of affordable housing projects.

135
00:20:26,471 --> 00:20:40,658
If we don't receive the grant, then we'll probably use approximately $80,000 to do feasibility study and pre-development work of city-owned parcels, and then the remaining funds for acquisition, construction, and support of affordable housing.

136
00:20:41,378 --> 00:20:46,719
So in total, we are requesting $250,000 from CPC.

137
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:51,360
We hope that this request is approved.

138
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,640
Thank you for your time.

139
00:20:53,181 --> 00:20:56,281
And if you have any questions, we're happy to answer.

140
00:20:57,261 --> 00:20:57,822
Thank you very much.

141
00:20:57,842 --> 00:21:00,942
Do we have any questions from members of the council?

142
00:21:03,603 --> 00:21:04,223
Councillor...

143
00:21:07,862 --> 00:21:12,163
No questions, just like to say I'm very glad to see this get up and running.

144
00:21:13,783 --> 00:21:19,185
And I fully support the initial investment of the Affordable Housing Trust.

145
00:21:19,205 --> 00:21:21,125
Thank you.

146
00:21:22,405 --> 00:21:23,246
Thank you, Councilor Leving.

147
00:21:25,586 --> 00:21:28,887
Any further questions from members of the Council or comments on this matter?

148
00:21:31,587 --> 00:21:33,808
Seeing none, are there any questions or comments from members of the public?

149
00:21:37,272 --> 00:21:38,272
Seeing none, thank you very much.

150
00:21:38,973 --> 00:21:39,393
Thank you.

151
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:43,574
Next we'll move to the Oak Grove Cemetery building restoration phase two.

152
00:21:45,755 --> 00:21:52,538
And I'll note for applicants, you know, we appreciate the presentation, but you don't have to come with a PowerPoint.

153
00:21:53,822 --> 00:21:55,544
We may have had a highly prepared group go first.

154
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:59,749
We just want to hear about your project and be able to ask questions if needed.

155
00:21:59,849 --> 00:22:03,053
So we'll go to the DPW commissioner, Tim McGivern.

156
00:22:03,414 --> 00:22:05,797
President Behrs, counselors, good evening.

157
00:22:05,817 --> 00:22:07,779
Tim McGivern, DPW commissioner.

158
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:10,943
Do you have something you want to say?

159
00:22:10,983 --> 00:22:11,844
I'm just here to support you.

160
00:22:12,116 --> 00:22:13,297
Okay, okay, cool.

161
00:22:14,017 --> 00:22:16,138
So I think you probably know a little bit about this project.

162
00:22:16,358 --> 00:22:22,641
So we got this funded last year through the same mechanism that was to bring the project into design development.

163
00:22:23,001 --> 00:22:24,462
So just a quick background.

164
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:32,446
The two buildings on the cemetery site are historic and they also are pretty rundown and need a lot of work.

165
00:22:33,046 --> 00:22:37,308
So we had a study performed to figure out what that scope of work actually is.

166
00:22:38,549 --> 00:22:39,771
and prepared an estimate.

167
00:22:40,552 --> 00:22:45,740
And then we sought money for continuing the design past conceptual into design.

168
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,886
We got that, and that's being done right now as we speak.

169
00:22:51,709 --> 00:22:55,092
And this request would complete the design process.

170
00:22:55,292 --> 00:23:01,618
So if we add another $84,000 and change to the design process, that will bring us to construction documents.

171
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:08,704
So that's what is known as shovel-ready documents, which are very useful to then seek construction funding.

172
00:23:09,684 --> 00:23:11,766
We don't have it funded to be built yet.

173
00:23:14,475 --> 00:23:17,877
has some early estimates in the $7.5 million zone.

174
00:23:17,917 --> 00:23:24,602
So the set of plans that is constructible is very important, and this will take us there.

175
00:23:27,904 --> 00:23:28,324
That's about it.

176
00:23:28,524 --> 00:23:30,025
I'm happy to answer questions on that project.

177
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:31,286
Thank you, Mr. Commissioner.

178
00:23:31,946 --> 00:23:34,368
Any questions on this project by members of the council?

179
00:23:39,711 --> 00:23:40,252
Seeing none.

180
00:23:43,342 --> 00:23:47,844
I just wondered, Tim, and give me a minute to pull my records together.

181
00:23:51,005 --> 00:23:55,387
From the first part of the project, OK, never mind.

182
00:23:55,447 --> 00:23:56,088
It's answered right in here.

183
00:23:56,108 --> 00:23:59,449
You're estimating $5 to $8 million for the restoration of, yeah.

184
00:23:59,689 --> 00:23:59,829
Yep.

185
00:23:59,949 --> 00:24:05,632
And we'll know a lot more after this milestone, because we'll have a design that can be cost estimated.

186
00:24:05,992 --> 00:24:06,252
OK.

187
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:13,075
And is the idea, have you thought, have you had discussions about potential funding sources for the project?

188
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,641
we have and getting some historic statuses cleaned up with the state.

189
00:24:17,441 --> 00:24:20,662
So we'll be working on that, you know, as we kind of plug along here.

190
00:24:20,822 --> 00:24:21,022
So.

191
00:24:21,303 --> 00:24:21,543
Great.

192
00:24:21,943 --> 00:24:22,303
Thank you.

193
00:24:24,784 --> 00:24:27,925
Seeing no questions on this project for members of the council.

194
00:24:27,945 --> 00:24:31,966
Are there any questions by members of the public, either in the chamber or on zoom?

195
00:24:36,328 --> 00:24:36,768
Seeing none.

196
00:24:36,828 --> 00:24:37,468
Thank you.

197
00:24:37,488 --> 00:24:40,349
Commissioner McGovern, we can move to ours.

198
00:24:40,449 --> 00:24:43,110
Mr. Bailey's still in the parks commission meeting.

199
00:24:46,602 --> 00:24:49,224
resurfacing was up while we still have Mr. McGivern.

200
00:24:49,505 --> 00:24:49,785
Oh, great.

201
00:24:49,845 --> 00:24:50,465
You're on that one.

202
00:24:50,525 --> 00:24:51,606
Okay, fantastic.

203
00:24:52,447 --> 00:24:53,027
Then we'll go to that.

204
00:24:53,228 --> 00:24:56,210
And it says DPW, so that makes sense, too.

205
00:24:56,430 --> 00:25:01,495
If you want to present the project for Playset Park tennis court resurfacing for $526,000.

206
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:03,416
Absolutely.

207
00:25:03,436 --> 00:25:04,717
So this one is pretty simple.

208
00:25:05,118 --> 00:25:08,721
The difference between similar projects in the past is this one is much larger.

209
00:25:09,281 --> 00:25:11,303
The Playset courts are five tennis courts.

210
00:25:13,798 --> 00:25:15,520
22,000 square feet of tennis court.

211
00:25:16,061 --> 00:25:23,948
So just using the cost to resurface something like that, you'll land in the 526,000 zone for an estimate.

212
00:25:24,829 --> 00:25:27,151
So that's what this would do, would resurface that entire court.

213
00:25:27,672 --> 00:25:35,579
If you've seen it recently, you know that there are large cracks developing in the court that are sort of detrimental to tennis play.

214
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:38,302
It's one of our more popular areas for tennis.

215
00:25:39,937 --> 00:25:41,858
and it doesn't have too much time left.

216
00:25:42,338 --> 00:25:53,422
So the idea is to bring it back to life with new nets and fence, and we'll try to make a little, I'm gonna try to fix the parking lot a little bit while we're there.

217
00:25:54,102 --> 00:25:55,323
So that's gonna be that project.

218
00:25:56,623 --> 00:25:59,224
And that's the dirt parking area?

219
00:25:59,444 --> 00:26:07,827
Yeah, that kind of ruts out all the time, and I'm gonna try to, while we have all kinds of paving equipment there, I'm gonna see if we can add a little bit onto it and see if we can fix it up a bit.

220
00:26:09,092 --> 00:26:10,535
Any questions by members of the council?

221
00:26:10,575 --> 00:26:14,104
Councilor Callahan and then Councilor Lazaro.

222
00:26:16,108 --> 00:26:17,130
And then Councilor Scarpelli.

223
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:18,062
Thank you.

224
00:26:18,182 --> 00:26:18,803
Hello.

225
00:26:19,103 --> 00:26:19,603
Great to see you.

226
00:26:20,623 --> 00:26:30,569
I am curious, just because of the information I know about our roads, that once they get past a certain deterioration rate, then they become a lot more expensive to repair.

227
00:26:31,209 --> 00:26:33,010
And I'm curious about tennis courts.

228
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:44,216
Is there that kind of a lifecycle where they should be repaired within a certain number of years, and then it becomes more expensive, only noticing that this is the most expensive item on our list?

229
00:26:44,236 --> 00:26:46,137
So I'm curious if that's something that we

230
00:26:46,797 --> 00:26:49,540
could pay less for in the future by repairing them earlier?

231
00:26:50,921 --> 00:26:51,521
Possibly.

232
00:26:52,422 --> 00:26:52,863
Possibly.

233
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:58,508
But my experience thus far has been the cracks begin to develop.

234
00:26:58,528 --> 00:27:03,092
And if you seal them, like we tried at what the heck was the park?

235
00:27:03,952 --> 00:27:04,493
Barry Park.

236
00:27:04,971 --> 00:27:10,673
at Barrie Park, you run into different problems that make it difficult to play.

237
00:27:10,954 --> 00:27:14,475
There's a difference between bouncing a ball on the surface and driving the car over it.

238
00:27:14,955 --> 00:27:28,641
So when we do preventative maintenance on asphalt, which we'll talk about later, we're doing things like crack sealing and patching, box out patching, which leaves seams and kind of protects the surface for longer as it degrades.

239
00:27:29,181 --> 00:27:31,842
But with playable surfaces, especially tennis,

240
00:27:33,923 --> 00:27:39,625
quality of the surface comes right through the cracks that usually begin in the base.

241
00:27:40,245 --> 00:27:48,087
So to summarize, we have tried to just recondition the surfaces and we just end up with bigger problems down the line.

242
00:27:48,687 --> 00:27:58,590
So once these large cracks develop, it indicates that there's a problem much deeper, a foot or two or more down in the pavement itself, in the base of the pavement.

243
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:12,402
So really the only way to resolve that and have a nice playing surface worth the money that you're going to spend on it is to pulverize the asphalt, recompact, regrade, and put a new surface on the top.

244
00:28:13,403 --> 00:28:13,803
Thank you so much.

245
00:28:13,823 --> 00:28:14,444
You're welcome.

246
00:28:14,944 --> 00:28:15,365
Thank you.

247
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:17,807
Councilor Zara and then Councilor Skripal and Councilor Zara.

248
00:28:18,702 --> 00:28:19,623
Thank you for presenting this.

249
00:28:20,383 --> 00:28:21,464
They are in pretty rough shape.

250
00:28:21,764 --> 00:28:23,005
I've played there every once in a while.

251
00:28:23,065 --> 00:28:23,726
It's very fun.

252
00:28:23,826 --> 00:28:27,068
It's a great asset to our community, so I'm glad we're addressing it.

253
00:28:27,108 --> 00:28:32,612
I was wondering if you could speak to, you may not have these numbers, but since it does mention in the report that

254
00:28:34,053 --> 00:28:37,236
It's rented by outside organizations.

255
00:28:37,356 --> 00:28:46,485
So this being something I think we should keep in mind that this is an expensive item, but it is also an income generating item.

256
00:28:46,966 --> 00:28:50,690
So it does make sense for us to put more money into it.

257
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:52,451
It's bringing money into the community.

258
00:28:52,852 --> 00:28:58,017
Do you know how much money it like these courts rent for or how much it brings in?

259
00:28:58,577 --> 00:28:59,317
I don't know.

260
00:28:59,598 --> 00:29:01,619
I know that's handled through the rec department.

261
00:29:01,779 --> 00:29:02,879
Is Kevin here?

262
00:29:02,899 --> 00:29:04,460
I don't know if he could answer that question.

263
00:29:05,261 --> 00:29:05,481
OK.

264
00:29:05,681 --> 00:29:07,382
But if you see him later, he might be able to answer that.

265
00:29:08,322 --> 00:29:12,044
Maybe for our next time talking about it, it'll have to be at the regular meeting, too, right?

266
00:29:12,124 --> 00:29:13,825
So that could.

267
00:29:13,845 --> 00:29:14,045
Sure.

268
00:29:14,626 --> 00:29:17,687
Yeah, I think there's a Parks Commission meeting happening in room 201 that he's in.

269
00:29:17,747 --> 00:29:19,208
I'm not 100% sure.

270
00:29:19,248 --> 00:29:19,869
So yeah.

271
00:29:21,289 --> 00:29:22,330
That's probably it, yeah.

272
00:29:22,617 --> 00:29:24,258
It's a curiosity for me more than anything.

273
00:29:24,278 --> 00:29:43,532
I just think that it's worth noting when we have facilities that are part of our city assets that if we can keep them up and then they bring other organizations into the city that pay rent.

274
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:49,357
And our pool is one of the things, the high school, tennis courts, various recreational facilities.

275
00:29:49,895 --> 00:29:52,017
I would say this is one of those areas.

276
00:29:52,317 --> 00:29:53,519
It's a very popular court.

277
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:54,279
It's always full.

278
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,463
It's seems to be very dedicated to tennis program.

279
00:29:58,043 --> 00:30:00,646
So thank you.

280
00:30:00,846 --> 00:30:01,307
You're welcome.

281
00:30:02,188 --> 00:30:03,689
And I'm hoping the bids coming under that too.

282
00:30:03,809 --> 00:30:04,430
By the way.

283
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:07,313
Thank you.

284
00:30:07,393 --> 00:30:09,175
Councilor Scarpelli.

285
00:30:09,235 --> 00:30:10,957
Thank you, President Villes.

286
00:30:11,973 --> 00:30:27,403
Um, I know that, um, when you look at the financial impacts to resurface, um, um, place that I know that our high school team uses that, uh, those courts and if

287
00:30:28,984 --> 00:30:35,830
those courts are not playable like in my profession where we've lost our courts for our high school team.

288
00:30:36,291 --> 00:30:44,558
We then have to bus our high school teams off site to support their practices.

289
00:30:44,658 --> 00:30:49,242
So I think that I know the high school uses it during the spring season.

290
00:30:49,262 --> 00:30:52,525
I know that Kevin does use it a lot with

291
00:30:53,688 --> 00:30:58,409
with outside groups or with recreation groups that bring in funding.

292
00:30:58,469 --> 00:31:14,834
So I think it's important that, especially as we're seeing pickleball grow, keeping tennis-only courts, especially when you're looking for a facility that is what placed it is, having, I believe, four courts, three or four courts.

293
00:31:17,547 --> 00:31:31,492
you know, the programming to be dedicated to tennis and it doesn't, it's not interrupted like what you see at over at Duggar Park, which is a huge benefit, but it also has to, has to be shared.

294
00:31:31,572 --> 00:31:38,355
So I think that's a huge piece to take in consideration, the money that's

295
00:31:39,848 --> 00:31:46,510
that's saved in the trickle down effect back to our budget when it comes down time to vote every little penny counts.

296
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:51,951
So I know that that's a huge benefit for our high school athletic program.

297
00:31:52,111 --> 00:31:53,032
So thank you.

298
00:31:55,792 --> 00:31:56,893
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

299
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:59,553
Any further questions, members of the council?

300
00:32:02,174 --> 00:32:05,795
I don't want to bring up any third rails, but is this going to remain tennis only?

301
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:07,180
or?

302
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,561
The direction I have right now is that it's tennis only.

303
00:32:09,841 --> 00:32:10,662
Okay, great.

304
00:32:11,542 --> 00:32:11,942
Thank you.

305
00:32:14,503 --> 00:32:19,025
Any questions by members of the public on the Placeland Park Tennis Court resurfacing?

306
00:32:23,447 --> 00:32:25,428
Seeing no hands on Zoom, no one in the chamber.

307
00:32:25,588 --> 00:32:26,889
Thank you, Commissioner.

308
00:32:27,229 --> 00:32:27,649
You're welcome.

309
00:32:31,791 --> 00:32:34,212
Move next to Condon Shell Lighting Improvement.

310
00:32:36,638 --> 00:32:39,461
And I'll speak on behalf of Director Bailey.

311
00:32:39,501 --> 00:32:43,164
This is a project that was discussed at length with the committee.

312
00:32:44,185 --> 00:32:51,672
So we're very excited to see this project because what this will do will bring field lighting to the stage performance area of Condon Shell.

313
00:32:52,353 --> 00:32:54,915
Currently, there are light fixtures there that are non-functioning.

314
00:32:54,995 --> 00:32:56,196
So if the sun goes down,

315
00:32:57,163 --> 00:32:58,685
go home, the concert's over.

316
00:32:59,045 --> 00:33:05,491
So this would extend the season as well as the daily usage of the Condon Shell for performances, which is great.

317
00:33:06,212 --> 00:33:18,363
This would also install pathway lighting, as you can see in this picture here, the P5, P4, and P3, that's pathway lighting that leads from the parking lot area to the backside of the Condon Shell.

318
00:33:18,764 --> 00:33:19,184
Currently,

319
00:33:20,345 --> 00:33:21,805
Actually, I even walked it this weekend.

320
00:33:21,845 --> 00:33:23,206
There's just string lights there.

321
00:33:23,966 --> 00:33:30,608
As anybody who goes to the farmer's market knows that that's the lighting that they rely on for the late season farmer's market is string lighting.

322
00:33:30,648 --> 00:33:32,448
So this would install permanent fixtures.

323
00:33:33,389 --> 00:33:37,830
It would allow for the recreation department to manage it by a remote app.

324
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:41,731
So no more, oh, let me run down and unlock the door and flip the switch.

325
00:33:41,791 --> 00:33:42,391
It's now boop.

326
00:33:42,831 --> 00:33:46,012
So this would make it a heck of a lot more efficient for our recreation.

327
00:33:46,836 --> 00:33:48,257
as well as just our city staff.

328
00:33:50,519 --> 00:34:02,966
And I apologize, it does look like Director Bailey has a conflict, but if there are any questions, I can certainly try to answer them or take them back to Director Bailey and have them for our next regular meeting.

329
00:34:04,007 --> 00:34:06,028
Thank you, Mayor Dupont.

330
00:34:06,048 --> 00:34:07,169
I'll go to Councilor Scarbelli.

331
00:34:09,891 --> 00:34:10,712
Thank you.

332
00:34:11,152 --> 00:34:33,630
I'm so happy to see this on the agenda that we're going to entertain this because I think that safety is the biggest concern, especially what we're seeing for activities at the Shell, not just for shows or entertainment, but for our farmers market and the ability to light that area, I think is so important.

333
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:36,752
I think when you look at that, the other piece that you see is

334
00:34:38,453 --> 00:34:58,185
As a recreation employee, as soon as we went to to Moscow lighting, we realized the cost savings that directly came back to our city and our department because of the fact that with the old system of lighting.

335
00:34:58,205 --> 00:35:01,287
1, it was archaic and to the.

336
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:21,234
understanding of someone sending somebody down to flick a switch and then come back later to flick the switch again would cost you four hours in overtime and that adds up believe it or not so musco lighting has been a godsend to municipalities so i think that it really saves

337
00:35:24,675 --> 00:35:30,002
when you look at finances and a hidden cost that really pays off at the end.

338
00:35:30,042 --> 00:35:33,667
So I'm glad to see this and I would support it as well.

339
00:35:33,707 --> 00:35:34,248
So thank you.

340
00:35:39,775 --> 00:35:40,816
Thank you Councilor Scarpelli.

341
00:35:41,237 --> 00:35:41,758
Councilor Lemming.

342
00:35:46,245 --> 00:35:50,948
Just looking at this, it says 98,285 on page 9, but I'm seeing 526 right below that on the construction.

343
00:35:51,008 --> 00:35:54,270
The 526 is for a playstead, so I apologize if there was an error.

344
00:36:03,765 --> 00:36:04,105
Okay.

345
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:04,525
Okay.

346
00:36:04,605 --> 00:36:08,347
So, yeah, I was thinking that that might have been a typo.

347
00:36:08,767 --> 00:36:16,210
So just want to make sure that that's caught before it's referred to.

348
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:17,230
Thank you.

349
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:19,451
Yes, this was a document I prepared.

350
00:36:19,591 --> 00:36:22,012
Our actual decision has the correct amount.

351
00:36:22,052 --> 00:36:23,853
Thank you for catching that, Councilor.

352
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,054
Yes, confirming 98285.

353
00:36:26,114 --> 00:36:26,534
Thank you.

354
00:36:30,868 --> 00:36:34,571
Any other questions for members of the Council on the Condon Shell?

355
00:36:37,914 --> 00:36:42,317
Seeing none, any questions from members of the public, either in person or on Zoom regarding the Condon Shell?

356
00:36:45,419 --> 00:36:53,886
Seeing none, we'll move to the next item we have.

357
00:36:54,667 --> 00:36:55,688
Council Chamber Window Restoration.

358
00:36:55,708 --> 00:36:57,749
Do you want to take that to the end or do you want to do it now?

359
00:36:59,707 --> 00:37:01,527
Maybe we can actually come back to that one.

360
00:37:01,547 --> 00:37:02,748
Sorry, Paul, if you're listening.

361
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:13,510
That's just a re... It's a proposal to essentially move around funding sources to move it towards the CPA application.

362
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:15,491
So nothing has changed with that project.

363
00:37:16,331 --> 00:37:20,432
And I'm sorry if we did wanna move on from it, but nothing has changed with the project.

364
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:27,974
It was just, it kind of aligned with CPA timeline to have it slide into our application round there.

365
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:32,073
saving the stabilization funds for being true emergency funds.

366
00:37:32,154 --> 00:37:39,322
So it would be a consideration to rescind the initial request for stabilization funds.

367
00:37:39,362 --> 00:37:41,524
And then I hate to use the word swap.

368
00:37:41,564 --> 00:37:45,949
I've been trying to not say swap, but change the funding sources to be CPA.

369
00:37:45,989 --> 00:37:48,792
Yeah, because this is a historic preservation project.

370
00:37:48,873 --> 00:37:49,153
Yeah.

371
00:37:49,424 --> 00:37:54,125
And it's in more alignment with the priorities of CPA, you know, it's true historic preservation.

372
00:37:55,466 --> 00:38:08,589
So it aligns very well and it does free up that stabilization emergency funds for other, it just kind of all lined up really nicely in this regard, but it would- Using restricted money instead of unrestricted.

373
00:38:08,669 --> 00:38:09,069
Correct.

374
00:38:09,449 --> 00:38:09,709
Correct.

375
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:10,390
All right.

376
00:38:13,293 --> 00:38:16,176
Do we have any questions on this one?

377
00:38:16,196 --> 00:38:22,324
And I just have a procedural note, but I'll wait till, do councilors have questions about this?

378
00:38:25,427 --> 00:38:26,649
Councilor Lazaro.

379
00:38:28,791 --> 00:38:29,492
Just one question.

380
00:38:29,532 --> 00:38:32,596
Does it delay the work at all?

381
00:38:33,859 --> 00:38:38,303
minimally, maybe by a week or two, just because of the procedures.

382
00:38:38,403 --> 00:38:45,429
I mean, if everything goes well today and next week, we hope to seek approval from this honorable body next Tuesday at the regular meeting.

383
00:38:45,449 --> 00:38:47,531
So just at that point, paperwork, so.

384
00:38:47,631 --> 00:38:50,574
Okay.

385
00:38:50,674 --> 00:38:54,317
Is there anything, I'll go to Councilor Lemming, and then I'll ask.

386
00:38:55,258 --> 00:38:56,319
Go ahead, Councilor Lemming.

387
00:38:56,579 --> 00:38:59,762
Would we need to add into that a motion to rescind

388
00:39:01,482 --> 00:39:05,308
the money given from the stabilization funds along with that?

389
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:07,672
We're going to need to figure that out.

390
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:08,833
That was what I was going to bring up.

391
00:39:09,254 --> 00:39:15,864
So we're going to need a separate letter from the mayor requesting that we rescind the appropriation of the stabilization fund money.

392
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:19,742
because you can't ask us to do that.

393
00:39:20,262 --> 00:39:20,743
No, I can't.

394
00:39:21,263 --> 00:39:31,130
But it is a project that the CPC has recommended, so we wanted to continue that with our process here, but I will certainly work with the mayor on getting that well in time for next week.

395
00:39:31,351 --> 00:39:35,834
Great, yeah, so that should just be a separate paper on our agenda, because it's an appropriation.

396
00:39:35,854 --> 00:39:44,680
I do want to ask if the facilities manager, Paul Riggi, do you have anything you want to add to this?

397
00:39:46,202 --> 00:39:49,564
No, I think Teresa has covered it.

398
00:39:49,705 --> 00:39:52,407
The vendor is patiently waiting to start.

399
00:39:53,608 --> 00:40:00,974
So as soon as we give them the green light, they're going to get ready to mobilize and get those windows.

400
00:40:01,294 --> 00:40:05,918
I think the picture that you're seeing kind of shows

401
00:40:06,759 --> 00:40:15,443
the condition of those windows, and I can't wait to bring them back to what they looked like when that chamber was built.

402
00:40:17,263 --> 00:40:19,124
Thank you, Manager Reed.

403
00:40:19,204 --> 00:40:20,965
And Paul, I have one other question.

404
00:40:22,866 --> 00:40:27,648
Is this going to include, it's going to be restoration of the wood frame windows, does it also include

405
00:40:28,545 --> 00:40:30,406
the shades and that?

406
00:40:30,906 --> 00:40:49,516
That is going to be a separate item, which I believe the mayor will be talking later about concerning obtaining some stabilization funding to do the shades and the curtains to bring them back to where they should also be.

407
00:40:50,516 --> 00:40:51,237
Great, thank you.

408
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:57,520
Any further questions by members of the council on the window restoration?

409
00:41:02,822 --> 00:41:04,243
Councilor Scarpelli, is your hand up for this?

410
00:41:06,585 --> 00:41:10,588
No, I apologize, Mr. President, it's left up, sorry.

411
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:12,670
Thank you, just wanted to make sure.

412
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:18,454
All right, on that note, is there any discussion by members of the public on this item?

413
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:28,182
And I can't remember the meeting date, but we did go into a little bit more detail on this project in December or November.

414
00:41:28,642 --> 00:41:31,184
Yeah, and we'll have those details in the memo.

415
00:41:31,324 --> 00:41:32,005
Great, thank you.

416
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:39,244
Seeing none, we'll move on to the next item, which is our Shiloh Baptist Church ADA improvements phase two, 400,000.

417
00:41:41,364 --> 00:41:49,388
We are joined today by Mr. Cliff Singleton, who's the project manager, as well as Mr. Bill McIntyre, who is a representative of the church.

418
00:41:49,728 --> 00:41:50,048
Awesome.

419
00:41:50,068 --> 00:41:52,089
I'm going to turn the pulpit over to you, gentlemen.

420
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:54,370
Thank you very much, councilors.

421
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:55,651
Welcome to both of you.

422
00:41:55,671 --> 00:42:01,673
I haven't had the pleasure to go before you before, so any hiccups, let me know.

423
00:42:02,014 --> 00:42:02,594
Absolutely.

424
00:42:03,842 --> 00:42:24,405
What we're doing here at Shiloh, we're following up on a project that we started last year, and that was to gain accessibility to the lower section of Shiloh Baptist Church with a elevator, and that will allow us to have a daycare put into that facility that will serve the community.

425
00:42:25,686 --> 00:42:33,247
And also the community occasionally has meetings with other churches and local people.

426
00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:38,662
So that will do a good number of things at one time with short money.

427
00:42:39,763 --> 00:42:41,945
We have gone through the design phase.

428
00:42:43,206 --> 00:42:44,387
We deleted the building.

429
00:42:45,108 --> 00:42:54,717
All the other monies that came last year, we've spent most of that for design, some legal work, some CPA work.

430
00:42:55,177 --> 00:42:58,300
So all the things are there for construction.

431
00:42:59,177 --> 00:43:01,958
So the design is pretty much finished.

432
00:43:02,378 --> 00:43:09,000
You'll just have to probably go to a little sharpening or pencil and come to your building department.

433
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:13,141
And so we're really ready to go, which is a nice feeling.

434
00:43:13,821 --> 00:43:19,523
I hope that we will be in favor here to continue this project on and so forth.

435
00:43:19,583 --> 00:43:28,105
I know that the daycare is a needed facility in that area and that the experienced

436
00:43:29,432 --> 00:43:36,918
daycare person who wants to rent that facility is here, not in this facility, but ready to go.

437
00:43:36,938 --> 00:43:38,499
All right.

438
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:51,270
And I would say that the term of starting the construction is your approvals and some minor building kinds of things that will probably have to be done with the building department.

439
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:54,773
So those are the things that we have here today.

440
00:43:55,727 --> 00:44:01,070
The church body itself is ready to support whatever effort is needed.

441
00:44:01,651 --> 00:44:03,212
So that's where we are today.

442
00:44:03,652 --> 00:44:04,873
Do you have any questions?

443
00:44:06,313 --> 00:44:08,195
Do we have any questions by members of the Council?

444
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:16,540
I'll go to Councilor Lemming.

445
00:44:19,293 --> 00:44:23,957
No questions again, but I just like to say, I'm glad to see this happening.

446
00:44:23,977 --> 00:44:30,663
Glad to see a space being made for a daycare and afterschool programs and welcome to city hall.

447
00:44:31,123 --> 00:44:31,483
Thank you.

448
00:44:34,206 --> 00:44:34,606
Thank you.

449
00:44:34,666 --> 00:44:34,866
Yes.

450
00:44:34,946 --> 00:44:36,447
And seeing no other questions from the council.

451
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:37,528
I also just want to say.

452
00:44:37,568 --> 00:44:39,290
Mr. President, I'm sorry, my hand was up.

453
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:40,371
Councillor Scarbelli.

454
00:44:42,305 --> 00:45:10,630
no i apologize i put it up and down so many times i just wanted to make sure that miss dupont just uh just share with the public i know that we've had some questions in the past and i had an email today just that people were questioning whether um how does this fit as if it's not a city facility this is something that i support as a historical building in our community and trying to enhance that and make sure we we provide assistance any way we can to

455
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:31,320
to make sure the Shallow Baptist and I believe the Unitarian Church as well that people understand that there are criteria that we follow that but legally we can use our CPA funds to assist in projects like this.

456
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,221
I know that the question that I had today was

457
00:45:35,122 --> 00:45:57,483
they weren't against any of these uh the the churches personally but the question was if the tax money is uh is it going to a city owned facility that's what they were confused in so i know that i know if miss dupont can expand expand on that a little bit i know that there are some legalities that show that it absolutely fits into this um

458
00:45:58,124 --> 00:46:12,176
this criteria and we're not violating any legal issues, but I just wanted to make sure we had clarification on that because I want to make sure that there's no negativity behind any of these projects.

459
00:46:12,216 --> 00:46:21,364
I think they're all worthwhile and in my mind fit the scope of historical and I would support it a thousand percent.

460
00:46:21,384 --> 00:46:22,405
But just for that fact,

461
00:46:23,046 --> 00:46:29,716
if we can share any information that would help clear some questions some residents that have asked.

462
00:46:30,977 --> 00:46:31,258
Thank you.

463
00:46:37,325 --> 00:46:38,726
Thank you.

464
00:46:38,926 --> 00:46:51,350
Yes, well, I would like to first say that what CPA stands for is Community Preservation Act, and I don't think we should define community by whether it's city owned or publicly owned.

465
00:46:51,830 --> 00:46:59,593
It's where we all gather, and churches were one of the original gathering places for communities, if not the only community gathering place.

466
00:46:59,633 --> 00:47:04,695
So to address the question here of the legality of tax funding going towards religious

467
00:47:05,995 --> 00:47:06,876
organizations.

468
00:47:07,416 --> 00:47:16,221
We recognize it as a community space and we're happy to reinvest that funding back in so that the taxpayers of Medford can benefit from it as a public benefit.

469
00:47:17,642 --> 00:47:27,548
I'll also share just to address any specific questions that we put into our conditions of funding that no funding can be used in the restoration of

470
00:47:28,448 --> 00:47:29,949
for instance, religious imagery.

471
00:47:30,729 --> 00:47:38,192
Shiloh Baptist had also, and in other communities, CPA funding has been used to restore many church elements.

472
00:47:38,873 --> 00:47:42,394
Perhaps if we look at stained glass, how many stained glass windows you guys have there?

473
00:47:43,015 --> 00:47:43,895
Quite a few, right?

474
00:47:44,475 --> 00:47:49,438
But the funding cannot be used for any stained glass that has religious imagery or anything like that.

475
00:47:50,734 --> 00:48:06,731
Because the architect, basically, when he was designing the project, talked a little bit with historical people, because we wanted the addition to be pretty much what the historical society would want if they wanted a facility.

476
00:48:07,171 --> 00:48:10,274
So we're not really addressing any of the windows or anything else.

477
00:48:10,615 --> 00:48:13,698
So the design will be compatible with what is there.

478
00:48:14,555 --> 00:48:18,560
And again, that's kind of boilerplate language with other communities as well.

479
00:48:19,201 --> 00:48:25,410
That's a very good question, and I'm glad that you raised it, Councilor Scarpelli, because it's important for everybody to understand.

480
00:48:25,915 --> 00:48:26,696
Okay, I appreciate it.

481
00:48:26,716 --> 00:48:27,897
I know that there really weren't.

482
00:48:27,977 --> 00:48:30,340
It wasn't about just the facility that it was.

483
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:31,121
It was a church.

484
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:32,442
It was that focus.

485
00:48:32,482 --> 00:48:42,453
The question was that if it's not a city facility, but I appreciate that answer being that defining that a community exactly what the title title is about.

486
00:48:42,493 --> 00:48:44,395
So thank you for clarifying that.

487
00:48:44,415 --> 00:48:46,377
And I hope that residents.

488
00:48:47,518 --> 00:48:55,420
feel that that's adequate because I think it sure fits the purpose that I believe.

489
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:55,980
So thank you.

490
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:57,740
Thank you very much.

491
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:58,320
Thank you very much.

492
00:48:58,760 --> 00:48:59,140
Thank you.

493
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:00,161
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

494
00:49:00,281 --> 00:49:07,202
And I just wanted to add as well, I think it's a great project and serving a lot of community benefit out of it.

495
00:49:07,262 --> 00:49:11,003
I know daycare and childcare is so essential.

496
00:49:11,503 --> 00:49:14,523
And so to have that space be available for that is really wonderful.

497
00:49:15,404 --> 00:49:16,544
And I also hope it brings

498
00:49:17,674 --> 00:49:22,098
a lot of improvements to the building as well for all the other uses that people use it for.

499
00:49:22,118 --> 00:49:23,118
Thank you very much.

500
00:49:23,639 --> 00:49:24,019
Thank you.

501
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:25,360
Thank you.

502
00:49:27,502 --> 00:49:28,022
All right.

503
00:49:29,483 --> 00:49:35,248
Next, we will go to the UU Church exterior restoration.

504
00:49:35,268 --> 00:49:35,248
$99,000.

505
00:49:36,409 --> 00:49:42,373
I'll advance my slide, but I'm joined by Ms.

506
00:49:42,473 --> 00:49:44,115
Liz Ammons from the UU Church.

507
00:49:44,555 --> 00:49:44,835
Great.

508
00:49:44,875 --> 00:49:45,096
Thank you.

509
00:49:45,116 --> 00:49:45,276
Great.

510
00:49:47,591 --> 00:49:53,173
Hi, thank you for carrying this this far with our CPA grant.

511
00:49:53,553 --> 00:50:00,355
And I think I'll pick up on what Councillor Scarpelli was talking about, what's the benefit to the city and to the community.

512
00:50:01,275 --> 00:50:07,377
And the funding that we're applying for is to make significant repairs

513
00:50:08,217 --> 00:50:10,878
that are restorative on the outside of the church.

514
00:50:11,399 --> 00:50:13,560
And I'll just touch on three things.

515
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:20,443
One, the church is a really important historical landmark in Medford architecturally.

516
00:50:20,864 --> 00:50:25,086
It's an 1894 late Gothic revival structure.

517
00:50:25,566 --> 00:50:30,429
It has an immense, gorgeous stained glass window facing High Street.

518
00:50:30,849 --> 00:50:36,091
It's a block from the library, so it's in a prominent location in Medford Square.

519
00:50:37,112 --> 00:50:44,796
And so for the architectural historicity of the building, it's really important to keep it preserved in Medford.

520
00:50:45,296 --> 00:50:51,739
And the second thing is that it's also historically, culturally very important in Medford.

521
00:50:52,119 --> 00:50:57,121
It's the direct descendant of the first church in Medford, the Puritan Church, which was built in 1696.

522
00:50:57,701 --> 00:51:05,064
It, in the 19th century, was a prominent center of abolitionist activity.

523
00:51:05,684 --> 00:51:09,145
Lydia Maria Child grew up in the church, George Luther Stearns.

524
00:51:09,945 --> 00:51:15,206
who recruited the famous 54th and 55th regiments, was a member of the church.

525
00:51:16,427 --> 00:51:20,948
It was active in women's suffrage and the temperance movement.

526
00:51:21,888 --> 00:51:25,649
20th century, the church was active in the civil rights movement.

527
00:51:25,669 --> 00:51:29,490
The Reverend Eugene Adams marched with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

528
00:51:30,650 --> 00:51:43,914
And that legacy has continued into the present of the church being a place that is embracing various community issues and causes and important agendas.

529
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:54,537
So the third thing I want to say, in addition to the architectural importance and the cultural importance historically of the church, is its benefit to the community today.

530
00:51:55,437 --> 00:51:57,498
The church provides space

531
00:51:58,778 --> 00:52:03,660
rent-free to the community-covered food pantry and has done that for almost 30 years.

532
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:11,363
It's open every Thursday to families in need, serves 70 to 90 clients every week.

533
00:52:11,704 --> 00:52:16,506
It rents at very low cost space to AA, to Al-Anon,

534
00:52:18,075 --> 00:52:24,837
There are contra dancers, there's a community orchestra that uses the space, Tai Chi class uses the space.

535
00:52:25,177 --> 00:52:30,098
So it's a space that is available to the community and is really used by the community.

536
00:52:30,458 --> 00:52:47,523
So for those reasons, we are delighted to have the opportunity to apply for CPA restoration funds so the church can continue to be important historically to the city and in a contemporary way to the community.

537
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:51,731
Wonderful, thank you so much.

538
00:52:53,592 --> 00:52:56,213
Any questions or comments by members of the council?

539
00:52:58,594 --> 00:52:59,355
Councillor Lemming.

540
00:53:03,637 --> 00:53:04,238
Thank you, Liz.

541
00:53:04,498 --> 00:53:05,719
Wonderful presentation.

542
00:53:06,219 --> 00:53:07,120
I'm glad to see this.

543
00:53:08,181 --> 00:53:09,582
Glad to see this coming for the council.

544
00:53:10,422 --> 00:53:16,626
Actually, just if you could clarify, Council President Behr, since your comment earlier indicated you might know something about this.

545
00:53:16,666 --> 00:53:24,172
So I'm actually also a member of the EAU Church, just like Councilor Lazaro.

546
00:53:24,192 --> 00:53:25,753
Could you clarify sort of the

547
00:53:28,035 --> 00:53:38,427
ethics issues behind behind this, if any, or like you mentioned that we could still vote on this, because we're not personally benefiting by this even if we are members of the church.

548
00:53:38,988 --> 00:53:40,690
Yeah, I mean I think it's pretty.

549
00:53:41,498 --> 00:53:50,881
The standard test is, do you or any immediate family members or associates stand to benefit financially from your vote?

550
00:53:52,842 --> 00:53:55,043
And I don't, I mean, that's your call.

551
00:53:55,063 --> 00:53:55,983
I don't know.

552
00:53:57,103 --> 00:54:05,326
But unless you are going to be hired by the UU Church to do door restoration or someone in your family, which I don't think

553
00:54:05,983 --> 00:54:06,704
either of you are.

554
00:54:07,184 --> 00:54:09,286
I've attended a couple of services myself.

555
00:54:09,586 --> 00:54:11,627
I plan to vote on this.

556
00:54:12,648 --> 00:54:15,190
So that's generally the test.

557
00:54:15,350 --> 00:54:19,073
If you don't feel comfortable with it, I think we have the quorum and the votes to move forward without you.

558
00:54:20,554 --> 00:54:25,638
But yeah, you're not receiving a personal benefit from this project.

559
00:54:26,838 --> 00:54:27,078
Okay.

560
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:30,660
Councillor Lazaro, and you could check with the Ethics Commission.

561
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:32,721
If you wanted to ask them, you could ask them.

562
00:54:33,181 --> 00:54:34,582
You have to ask prior to a vote.

563
00:54:34,702 --> 00:54:39,004
So if you abstain tonight, you could ask them in advance of the vote at the regular meeting.

564
00:54:40,185 --> 00:54:46,308
You could review their regulations online or review the conflict of interest and ethics trainings that we all have to take every year.

565
00:54:47,309 --> 00:54:50,370
But generally, I think you're in the clear on this one.

566
00:54:50,491 --> 00:54:51,091
Councillor Lazaro.

567
00:54:52,316 --> 00:54:54,738
Yeah, I think my impulse was sort of an abundance of caution.

568
00:54:55,478 --> 00:54:57,119
And I think you're right.

569
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:04,724
And I will probably abstain tonight, but this isn't the vote to finally, finally approve.

570
00:55:04,804 --> 00:55:07,666
So that's probably not a big deal.

571
00:55:08,687 --> 00:55:17,353
And just as an example, the mayor abstained from a vote in which her sister was maybe standing to

572
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:21,982
benefit directly financially from something that she would have voted on.

573
00:55:22,042 --> 00:55:24,564
So that seems like a clear situation.

574
00:55:24,604 --> 00:55:31,849
In this case, it would just be, this is actually a very community-like repair work.

575
00:55:31,909 --> 00:55:34,370
It's not a financial benefit to us.

576
00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:34,931
Right, yeah.

577
00:55:34,951 --> 00:55:38,173
I mean, unless you were being hired to do the work itself.

578
00:55:39,494 --> 00:55:41,395
That's really the only way I could see this being an issue.

579
00:55:43,845 --> 00:55:50,808
An example I can give you, in 2020, I and my family, my parents and I had invested in Medford Brewing Company.

580
00:55:51,428 --> 00:56:03,473
Prior to that, we had to, I called the ethics commission, we had to divest and sell our investments in order to, for me to vote on the brewpub ordinance because it would have benefited the, because we were investors.

581
00:56:04,453 --> 00:56:07,534
But this, I know it's a church, it's a nonprofit organization.

582
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:08,915
You're not shareholders.

583
00:56:11,305 --> 00:56:14,368
you're not paid by the organization, nor will you be paid for the work.

584
00:56:14,588 --> 00:56:17,671
So that's my general interpretation.

585
00:56:22,375 --> 00:56:22,615
All right.

586
00:56:22,856 --> 00:56:26,599
Any other questions on the Unitarian University Church's exterior restoration?

587
00:56:29,162 --> 00:56:32,745
By members of the council, seeing none, any thoughts, comments, questions by members of the public?

588
00:56:36,798 --> 00:56:43,361
Also seeing none, we can move to the last item, which is ABCD move-in assistance.

589
00:56:44,082 --> 00:56:51,285
Yes, we are joined today by Ntando Dubey and Joshua White from Action for Boston Community Development, ABCD.

590
00:56:51,726 --> 00:56:59,150
They're our regional nonprofit organization partner that helps with housing assistance, as well as fuel assistance.

591
00:56:59,210 --> 00:56:59,990
Gosh, what else do you do?

592
00:57:00,490 --> 00:57:01,611
A little bit of everything.

593
00:57:02,191 --> 00:57:04,172
So, good evening members of the council.

594
00:57:04,692 --> 00:57:16,818
Again, my name is Joshua white I am the director of housing and homelessness prevention for ABC Boston to my left is Patando Dube, who is my deputy director, it is my pleasure to speak with you tonight about the Medford move in program.

595
00:57:17,697 --> 00:57:28,845
whose goal is to provide rental assistance to households that either live in the city of Medford or looking to move into the city of Medford that are at or below 100% AMI.

596
00:57:30,306 --> 00:57:34,609
Specifically, it would be to provide first and last month's rent.

597
00:57:35,629 --> 00:57:43,295
Our goal would be to serve at least 19 households in the city with a cap of $4,000 per household.

598
00:57:45,436 --> 00:57:54,602
In addition to the rental assistance, they would also be receiving counseling services through our support services department, which is part of housing and homeless prevention.

599
00:57:55,302 --> 00:58:04,407
And then also they may be eligible for other services at ABCD Boston, like fuel assistance, healthcare, childcare, workforce development, and so on and so on.

600
00:58:04,768 --> 00:58:06,088
So that is why we are here today.

601
00:58:07,669 --> 00:58:08,190
Thank you.

602
00:58:08,510 --> 00:58:11,792
And I'll go to Councilor Lazaro.

603
00:58:12,012 --> 00:58:13,513
Councilor Lazaro and then Councilor Caput.

604
00:58:14,791 --> 00:58:15,496
Thank you for being here.

605
00:58:15,516 --> 00:58:15,918
I have

606
00:58:17,732 --> 00:58:18,892
This is a great program.

607
00:58:18,932 --> 00:58:26,114
I know that can be a very prohibitive thing for families, the startup costs of moving, relocating.

608
00:58:27,314 --> 00:58:37,056
If you are exiting homelessness, just the beginning, the first month of payments can be really difficult to overcome.

609
00:58:38,217 --> 00:58:39,677
So this sounds like a great program.

610
00:58:39,857 --> 00:58:44,478
I wanted to ask if there are programs in other communities that you're aware of where

611
00:58:45,158 --> 00:58:55,128
the community, the municipality, will cover these costs through different avenues, or if you offer this kind of programming in other cities?

612
00:58:55,148 --> 00:58:56,509
Out of curiosity.

613
00:58:56,609 --> 00:58:57,310
We do, we do.

614
00:58:57,370 --> 00:59:00,953
We currently offer these types of programs within the Mystic Valley itself.

615
00:59:01,774 --> 00:59:05,097
We are trying to offer these services in the city of Boston.

616
00:59:05,498 --> 00:59:07,920
That has been a challenge, but we are making some inroads.

617
00:59:09,934 --> 00:59:17,377
I heard recently about broker fees being less of an issue soon, maybe, hopefully, or now, I'm not sure.

618
00:59:18,237 --> 00:59:22,139
But that seems promising, because that can also be problematic for people.

619
00:59:23,379 --> 00:59:26,361
But this seems like a really, really good program and a really good use of our funds.

620
00:59:26,461 --> 00:59:28,262
So thank you for your work.

621
00:59:28,482 --> 00:59:28,782
Thank you.

622
00:59:29,922 --> 00:59:31,383
Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

623
00:59:35,567 --> 00:59:36,708
Thanks so much for the work that you do.

624
00:59:36,768 --> 00:59:37,529
It's really important.

625
00:59:38,429 --> 00:59:47,196
I just wanted a quick, for the record, for folks listening, can you let us know what 100% of AMI is in Bedford?

626
00:59:47,777 --> 00:59:48,017
Anyone?

627
00:59:48,397 --> 00:59:49,218
I know it's area median.

628
00:59:49,318 --> 00:59:51,680
I was just going to look it up, and then I was like, maybe the public should know, too.

629
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:55,323
But off the top of your head, nobody knows.

630
00:59:55,343 --> 01:00:04,029
I think it's a, don't quote me, I can probably get the numbers exactly for you, but I want to say it's 150-ish per family.

631
01:00:08,495 --> 01:00:10,076
Is it is it is it regional?

632
01:00:10,096 --> 01:00:10,556
I was looking up.

633
01:00:10,576 --> 01:00:11,677
I didn't find it instantly.

634
01:00:11,737 --> 01:00:21,324
So, We don't have to stop the meeting for that.

635
01:00:21,364 --> 01:00:23,225
I was just, I just thought it'd be interesting information.

636
01:00:23,245 --> 01:00:23,805
That's all.

637
01:00:23,825 --> 01:00:24,066
Thanks.

638
01:00:29,209 --> 01:00:32,351
Um well, any other questions or comments by members of the

639
01:00:36,586 --> 01:00:40,047
Seeing none, I just have one, this is our third year?

640
01:00:40,227 --> 01:00:42,168
Third year in a row we're doing the move-in program?

641
01:00:42,448 --> 01:00:43,388
Great, thank you.

642
01:00:45,728 --> 01:00:46,129
All right.

643
01:00:48,769 --> 01:00:50,010
That's for a family of four.

644
01:00:50,390 --> 01:00:56,011
For a family of four, which is kind of the standard, or a single occupant, is 114.

645
01:01:05,732 --> 01:01:06,672
Can I go ahead and stop sharing now?

646
01:01:13,035 --> 01:01:13,375
All right.

647
01:01:13,535 --> 01:01:15,496
Well, that is the conclusion.

648
01:01:17,917 --> 01:01:27,642
We'd either make a motion to refer, someone could make a motion to refer this to the regular meeting, and you guys could abstain if you want, or we could sever it.

649
01:01:28,282 --> 01:01:34,425
I just want to make sure Councilor Lozaro and Leming feel comfortable.

650
01:01:34,605 --> 01:01:34,785
Okay.

651
01:01:35,418 --> 01:01:41,203
We'll move to refer everything but the UU paper severed.

652
01:01:41,263 --> 01:01:46,967
That's a motion by Councilor Callahan, seconded by Councilor Lazaro, and I'll go to Councilor Lemming for discussion.

653
01:01:47,427 --> 01:01:50,830
Oh, I... You were just gonna do the same thing.

654
01:01:51,090 --> 01:02:01,038
Yeah, no, I was, well, I was just gonna say, like, I'm personally comfortable voting yes on it, but just to align with Councilor Lazaro and keep consistency, I'm just gonna abstain.

655
01:02:01,578 --> 01:02:06,202
Okay if you're both abstaining then I need a second from Councilor Sang Collins or Scarpelli.

656
01:02:06,442 --> 01:02:06,882
Second.

657
01:02:07,963 --> 01:02:17,571
On the motion by Councilor Callahan, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli to sever off the UU.

658
01:02:18,512 --> 01:02:22,095
Mr. Clerk please call the roll and refer to the regular meeting.

659
01:02:27,448 --> 01:02:33,193
This is a vote to just take the UU project out and advance it to the regular meeting.

660
01:02:35,094 --> 01:02:37,576
Just the UU and then everything else.

661
01:02:37,957 --> 01:02:38,177
Great.

662
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:45,123
Sever UU and then refer everything else to the council.

663
01:02:45,163 --> 01:02:48,385
This is to sever UU and refer UU to the regular meeting.

664
01:02:51,568 --> 01:02:53,429
And then we'll vote on everything else in the motion.

665
01:02:56,312 --> 01:02:56,472
Yeah.

666
01:03:13,372 --> 01:03:13,592
Yes.

667
01:03:13,832 --> 01:03:15,053
On the motion, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

668
01:03:16,034 --> 01:03:16,594
Council Kellyanne.

669
01:03:17,615 --> 01:03:18,455
Vice President Collins.

670
01:03:19,055 --> 01:03:19,296
Yes.

671
01:03:20,596 --> 01:03:21,357
Councilor Lazaro.

672
01:03:23,498 --> 01:03:23,998
Councilor Lemming.

673
01:03:25,419 --> 01:03:26,140
Councilor Scarpelli.

674
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:27,000
Yes.

675
01:03:28,281 --> 01:03:28,801
Councilor Sang.

676
01:03:29,462 --> 01:03:29,702
Yes.

677
01:03:30,823 --> 01:03:31,403
President Paris.

678
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:31,843
Yes.

679
01:03:31,923 --> 01:03:33,944
By the affirmative, two present, the motion passes.

680
01:03:34,685 --> 01:03:38,087
Is there a motion to refer the remaining papers to the regular meeting?

681
01:03:38,962 --> 01:03:43,111
On the motion of council, I'm going to refer the remaining by council Lazzaro.

682
01:03:43,813 --> 01:03:44,735
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

683
01:04:13,907 --> 01:04:17,368
It was, uh, Councilor Lemming and Councilor Lazaro was the second.

684
01:04:19,449 --> 01:04:20,609
Yeah.

685
01:04:20,629 --> 01:04:25,110
Councilor Calderon?

686
01:04:25,890 --> 01:04:26,750
Vice President Collins?

687
01:04:27,311 --> 01:04:27,551
Yes.

688
01:04:28,631 --> 01:04:29,131

Yes.

Yes.

I mean, from the negative, the motion passes.

698
01:04:42,745 --> 01:04:44,206
Anything else anyone would like to add?

We won't be asking questions.
