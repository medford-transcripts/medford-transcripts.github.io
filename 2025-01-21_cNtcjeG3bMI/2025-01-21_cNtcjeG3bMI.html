    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=609.572s">The</a>  manager.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=610.793s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=611.293s">Thank</a>  you very much for your time in gathering today to hear about our fiscal 25 Community Preservation Act applications. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=618.459s">I'm</a>  joined a little bit on remote on Zoom as well as some lovely folks here in the room to discuss the merit of their applications. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=626.966s">I</a>  have a very brief <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=629.573s">presentation</a>  just to kind of kick it off to share with everybody just to kind of acquaint folks with what CPA is all about and hopefully this will work well for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=645.141s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=646.122s">So</a>  again, we're here today to talk about our fiscal 25 CPA applications annually. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=650.705s">We</a>  hold an application round where folks bring their projects to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=654.688s">We</a>  weigh the applications. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=656.589s">This</a>  is the next step. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=657.61s">All</a>  of the applications that you're about to hear have been approved and recommended for funding by the CPC. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=665.596s">The</a>  next step for all who are listening is for appropriation requests to be approved by this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=671.74s">Just</a>  a really quick recap on what CPA is. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=674.742s">It</a>  was voted in by ballot measure in November 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=677.224s">We</a>  started seeing revenues generated in fiscal year 18. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=680.526s">It</a>  is a 1.5% surcharge on top of your taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=685.529s">So</a>  it's not a huge bucket of money, but every year we bring in somewhere between 1.8 and $2 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=693.354s">some</a>  years more, some years less. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=695.036s">So</a>  to date, for the first six years that we've been funding projects, around here on the bottom, we've given out about $13.2 million, reinvesting back into the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=705.682s">So</a>  tonight, this is a very brief overview of the applications. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=708.963s">There</a>  are slides that kind of go into a little bit more detail here. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=711.924s">But</a>  overall, the applications that you'll be hearing tonight, Carr Park Phase 2 and Riverside Plaza, those were actually already approved by this honorable body earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=720.066s">So</a>  you'll be hearing from the Affordable Housing Trust for their initial startup funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=725.548s">They</a>  have none, so this is just kind of an initial seed money, if you will. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=729.422s">We'll</a>  be hearing from DPW Commissioner McGivern on the Oak Grove building restoration, as well as Playset Park Tennis Courts resurfacing project. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=738.187s">We'll</a>  be joined by Director Bailey to speak on the condon shell lighting improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=743.77s">I</a>  will circle back on the council chamber window restoration. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=746.771s">This</a>  is a project that this body has heard before. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=749.873s">We'll</a>  explain that one when we get to that project. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=751.674s">We're</a>  also joined by our community members here at the Shiloh Baptist Church for phase two of their ADA improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=759.178s">our</a>  friends at the Unitarian Universalist Church for exterior building restoration, some just siding work, if you will, as well as our partners at EBCD to continue the Medford Move-In program, which is a rental assistance program here in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=773.068s">I'm</a>  going to pause to see if there's any initial questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=774.949s">Otherwise,</a>  I will go ahead and invite Aditi Mavor and Lisa Davidson from our housing trust to come up and speak about their project, if there were no questions.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=786.037s">Any</a>  questions by members of the council at this time? <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=790.742s">seeing</a>  Councilor Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=797.627s">I</a>  am a member of the Unitarian Universalist Church of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=801.21s">I</a>  think I should recuse myself from that portion of the discussion for tonight.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=808.092s">I</a>  think that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=809.994s">You</a>  also don't stand to benefit personally from it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=811.935s">So</a>  it's probably a mixed case, but it's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=816.038s">We'll</a>  just mark you present when we vote on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=819.881s">Maybe</a>  we can sever that vote.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=822.243s">And</a>  just to clarify, we're not voting on recommendations tonight, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=825.806s">That</a>  will be at the next regular city council or can we vote from- We're referring them to the regular meeting.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=830.649s">Okay,</a>  I just wanted to clarify that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=832.211s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=832.491s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=832.931s">It's</a>  only my second time doing this.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=834.192s">No,</a>  no, you're doing great.</p>

    <p>[Moogoor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=837.898s">Thank</a>  you, Teresa, for the brief introduction. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=840.581s">Good</a>  evening, members of the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=842.662s">I'm</a>  Aditi Mugur. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=843.723s">I</a>  staff the Affordable Housing Trust Fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=846.166s">Joining</a>  with me this evening is Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=848.047s">Lisa</a>  Ann Davidson, who's the chair of the trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=851.331s">And</a>  I believe vice chair, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=853.713s">Penelope</a>  Taylor is virtually present, along with Roberta Cameron, who's one of the trustees and also the CPC chairperson. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=865.987s">As</a>  you may be aware, Affordable Housing Trust Fund is a newly established board. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=871.349s">The</a>  ordinance to establish the Affordable Housing Trust Fund was adopted last year by the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=878.511s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=880.232s">We've</a>  had our first Affordable Housing Trust monthly meeting in August last year, and so far we've had six monthly meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=888.495s">We've</a>  made significant progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=891.237s">The</a>  trust is developing a five-year action plan to identify the city's affordable housing needs and priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=898.983s">Since</a>  from October to December, the trust has <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=904.007s">collected</a>  housing data information and done some preliminary analysis. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=908.308s">And</a>  last December and this January, the trust conducted two stakeholder engagement sessions to understand how affordable housing developers and housing stability and supportive service providers <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=922.453s">understand</a>  the needs and of affordable housing developments and services in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=928.855s">And</a>  then we plan to host a community engagement meeting in March. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=934.297s">And</a>  probably in mid or late summer, we plan to have the action plan finalized. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=942.78s">The</a>  trust also signed the Declaration of Trust, which allows the trust to transfer or own property. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=951.207s">It</a>  also outlines the various rules and regulations of the trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=956.733s">End</a>  of this month or early Feb, we will record the Declaration of Trust at the Registry of Deeds. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=964.66s">Here</a>  are some project examples that the trust is thinking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=971.388s">These</a>  are not concrete projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=973.55s">These</a>  are just potential examples. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=975.513s">As</a>  the trust finalizes the action plan, we'll have a more concrete understanding of what the projects are going to be in the next five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=985.404s">One</a>  project example is to explore development of affordable housing on city-owned parcels. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=992.645s">The</a>  trust could take two different approaches. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=995.526s">One</a>  is to seek a state grant that does site feasibility and pre-development work on city-owned parcels and also helps develop a request for proposals to solicit bids. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1008.468s">This</a>  is a technical assistance grant that values between $50,000 to $100,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1014.969s">To</a>  avail this grant, the local municipality has to provide a 10% cash match, so we are hoping to use CPA funds for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1025.478s">In</a>  case we are not successful in getting this grant, we hope to use CPA funds to do site feasibility pre-development work and solicit bids for affordable housing developments. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1038.649s">Another</a>  project example is to support the construction of new affordable housing, Medford Housing Authorities, Authority Community Development Corporations, Community Housing Development Organization, which is the Medford Community Housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1053.418s">They</a>  all have affordable housing projects, and we aim to support the construction of these projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1059.962s">We</a>  don't have a community land trust yet, but currently we are doing a study on community land trust and we are hoping that moving forward we can support a potential land trust in its projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1073.082s">The</a>  third example is to build a fund to purchase land. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1077.164s">As</a>  I said, the declaration of trust allows the Board of Trustees to acquire and purchase land, so we're hoping that CPA funds can support this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1089.03s">The</a>  idea is to acquire privately owned parcels, and that is adjoining city-owned parcels to sort of maximize the intensity and scale of the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1098.355s">The</a>  trust could also purchase existing affordable housing units. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1103.902s">A</a>  third example is to provide down payment assistance to first-time homebuyers. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1110.507s">This</a>  is to support households whose income is at or below 100% AMI. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1115.33s">And</a>  the last potential project would be to support rental assistance programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1122.435s">Currently,</a>  we have <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1124.79s">move</a>  in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1126.352s">But</a>  in the future, the trust will probably look at the existing rental assistance programs and identify what are the barriers and opportunities and may propose to redesign better rental assistance programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1140.427s">And</a>  we hope that CPA funds can be used to support these programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1148.489s">In</a>  addition to requesting CPA funds, the trust is looking at applying to Mass Housing Grant, as I mentioned earlier, to do some pre-development work on city-owned parcels. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1161.721s">And</a>  then there's a developer payment coming through a project under Mystic Valley Development Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1170.99s">The</a>  project is 600 Rivers Edge. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1172.891s">We</a>  don't have <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1175.882s">We</a>  don't have it in writing yet, but there are negotiations underway. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1181.353s">And</a>  we're hoping that through the zoning overhaul, we'll introduce a fractional payment as part of the inclusionary housing fee, and this could support the affordable housing trust fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1193.938s">And</a>  lastly, the affordable housing linkage. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1197.82s">Once</a>  we do a next study, we hope to add affordable housing linkage as part of the existing linkage program. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1205.063s">These</a>  are some of the potential funding sources that the trust is looking into. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1212.325s">To</a>  sum up, this is a tentative budget breakdown of CPA funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1218.708s">The</a>  CPA funds could be used for local cash match, and then for acquisition, construction, and support of affordable housing projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1226.471s">If</a>  we don't receive the grant, then we'll probably use approximately $80,000 to do feasibility study and pre-development work of city-owned parcels, and then the remaining funds for acquisition, construction, and support of affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1241.378s">So</a>  in total, we are requesting $250,000 from CPC. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1248.119s">We</a>  hope that this request is approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1251.8s">Thank</a>  you for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1253.181s">And</a>  if you have any questions, we're happy to answer.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1257.261s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1257.842s">Do</a>  we have any questions from members of the council?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1300.133s">Next</a>  we'll move to the Oak Grove Cemetery building restoration phase two. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1305.755s">And</a>  I'll note for applicants, you know, we appreciate the presentation, but you don't have to come with a PowerPoint. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1313.822s">We</a>  may have had a highly prepared group go first. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1315.584s">We</a>  just want to hear about your project and be able to ask questions if needed.</p>

    <p>[McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1319.849s">So</a>  we'll go to the DPW commissioner, Tim McGivern. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1323.414s">President</a>  Bears, Councilors, good evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1325.817s">Tim</a>  McGivern, DPW commissioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1327.799s">Do</a>  you have something you want to say?</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1330.983s">I'm</a>  just here to support you.</p>

    <p>[McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1332.116s">Okay,</a>  okay, cool. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1334.017s">So</a>  I think you probably know a little bit about this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1336.358s">So</a>  we got this funded last year through the same mechanism that was to bring the project into design development. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1343.001s">So</a>  just a quick background. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1345.802s">The</a>  two buildings on the cemetery site are historic and they also are pretty rundown and need a lot of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1353.046s">So</a>  we had a study performed to figure out what that scope of work actually is. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1358.549s">and</a>  prepared an estimate. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1360.552s">And</a>  then we sought money for continuing the design past conceptual into design. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1365.76s">We</a>  got that, and that's being done right now as we speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1371.709s">And</a>  this request would complete the design process. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1375.292s">So</a>  if we add another $84,000 and change to the design process, that will bring us to construction documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1382.298s">So</a>  that's what is known as shovel-ready documents, which are very useful to then seek construction funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1389.684s">We</a>  don't have it funded to be built yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1394.475s">has</a>  some early estimates in the $7.5 million zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1397.917s">So</a>  the set of plans that is constructible is very important, and this will take us there. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1407.904s">That's</a>  about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1408.524s">I'm</a>  happy to answer questions on that project.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1410.325s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Commissioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1411.946s">Any</a>  questions on this project by members of the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1419.711s">Seeing</a>  none. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1423.342s">I</a>  just wondered, Tim, and give me a minute to pull my records together. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1431.005s">From</a>  the first part of the project, OK, never mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1435.447s">It's</a>  answered right in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1436.108s">You're</a>  estimating $5 to $8 million for the restoration of, yeah.</p>

    <p>[McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1439.689s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1439.949s">And</a>  we'll know a lot more after this milestone, because we'll have a design that can be cost estimated.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1445.992s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1446.812s">And</a>  is the idea, have you thought, have you had discussions about potential funding sources for the project?</p>

    <p>[McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1453.7s">we</a>  have and getting some historic statuses cleaned up with the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1457.441s">So</a>  we'll be working on that, you know, as we kind of plug along here. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1460.822s">So.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1461.303s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1461.943s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1464.784s">Seeing</a>  no questions on this project for members of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1467.945s">Are</a>  there any questions by members of the public, either in the chamber or on zoom? <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1476.328s">Seeing</a>  none. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1476.828s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1477.488s">Commissioner</a>  McGovern, we can move to ours. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1480.449s">Mr.</a>  Bailey's still in the parks commission meeting.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1486.602s">resurfacing</a>  was up while we still have Mr. McGivern.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1489.505s">Oh,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1489.845s">You're</a>  on that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1490.525s">Okay,</a>  fantastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1492.447s">Then</a>  we'll go to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1493.228s">And</a>  it says DPW, so that makes sense, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1496.43s">If</a>  you want to present the project for Playset Park tennis court resurfacing for $526,000.</p>

    <p>[McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1502.976s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1503.436s">So</a>  this one is pretty simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1505.118s">The</a>  difference between similar projects in the past is this one is much larger. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1509.281s">The</a>  Playset courts are five tennis courts. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1513.798s">22,000</a>  square feet of tennis court. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1516.061s">So</a>  just using the cost to resurface something like that, you'll land in the 526,000 zone for an estimate. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1524.829s">So</a>  that's what this would do, would resurface that entire court. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1527.672s">If</a>  you've seen it recently, you know that there are large cracks developing in the court that are sort of detrimental to tennis play. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1535.98s">It's</a>  one of our more popular areas for tennis. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1539.937s">and</a>  it doesn't have too much time left. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1542.338s">So</a>  the idea is to bring it back to life with new nets and fence, and we'll try to make a little, I'm gonna try to fix the parking lot a little bit while we're there. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1554.102s">So</a>  that's gonna be that project. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1556.623s">And</a>  that's the dirt parking area? <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1559.444s">Yeah,</a>  that kind of ruts out all the time, and I'm gonna try to, while we have all kinds of paving equipment there, I'm gonna see if we can add a little bit onto it and see if we can fix it up a bit.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1569.092s">Any</a>  questions by members of the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1570.575s">Councilor</a>  Callahan and then Councilor Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1576.108s">And</a>  then Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1577.742s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1578.182s">Hello.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1579.103s">Great</a>  to see you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1580.623s">I</a>  am curious, just because of the information I know about our roads, that once they get past a certain deterioration rate, then they become a lot more expensive to repair. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1591.209s">And</a>  I'm curious about tennis courts. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1594.15s">Is</a>  there that kind of a lifecycle where they should be repaired within a certain number of years, and then it becomes more expensive, only noticing that this is the most expensive item on our list? <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1604.236s">So</a>  I'm curious if that's something that we <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1606.797s">could</a>  pay less for in the future by repairing them earlier?</p>

    <p>[McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1610.921s">Possibly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1612.422s">Possibly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1612.903s">But</a>  my experience thus far has been the cracks begin to develop. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1618.528s">And</a>  if you seal them, like we tried at what the heck was the park? <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1623.952s">Barry</a>  Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1624.971s">at</a>  Barrie Park, you run into different problems that make it difficult to play. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1630.954s">There's</a>  a difference between bouncing a ball on the surface and driving the car over it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1634.955s">So</a>  when we do preventative maintenance on asphalt, which we'll talk about later, we're doing things like crack sealing and patching, box out patching, which leaves seams and kind of protects the surface for longer as it degrades. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1649.181s">But</a>  with playable surfaces, especially tennis, <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1653.923s">quality</a>  of the surface comes right through the cracks that usually begin in the base. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1660.245s">So</a>  to summarize, we have tried to just recondition the surfaces and we just end up with bigger problems down the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1668.687s">So</a>  once these large cracks develop, it indicates that there's a problem much deeper, a foot or two or more down in the pavement itself, in the base of the pavement. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1679.29s">So</a>  really the only way to resolve that and have a nice playing surface worth the money that you're going to spend on it is to pulverize the asphalt, recompact, regrade, and put a new surface on the top.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1693.403s">Thank</a>  you so much.</p>

    <p>[McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1693.823s">You're</a>  welcome.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1694.944s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1695.485s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro and then Councilor Skripal and Councilor Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1698.702s">Thank</a>  you for presenting this. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1700.383s">They</a>  are in pretty rough shape. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1701.764s">I've</a>  played there every once in a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1703.065s">It's</a>  very fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1703.826s">It's</a>  a great asset to our community, so I'm glad we're addressing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1707.108s">I</a>  was wondering if you could speak to, you may not have these numbers, but since it does mention in the report that <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1714.053s">It's</a>  rented by outside organizations. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1717.356s">So</a>  this being something I think we should keep in mind that this is an expensive item, but it is also an income generating item. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1726.966s">So</a>  it does make sense for us to put more money into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1730.91s">It's</a>  bringing money into the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1732.852s">Do</a>  you know how much money it like these courts rent for or how much it brings in?</p>

    <p>[McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1738.577s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1739.598s">I</a>  know that's handled through the rec department. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1741.779s">Is</a>  Kevin here? <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1742.899s">I</a>  don't know if he could answer that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1745.261s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1745.681s">But</a>  if you see him later, he might be able to answer that.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1748.322s">Maybe</a>  for our next time talking about it, it'll have to be at the regular meeting, too, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1752.124s">So</a>  that could. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1753.845s">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1754.626s">Yeah,</a>  I think there's a Parks Commission meeting happening in room 201 that he's in. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1757.747s">I'm</a>  not 100% sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1759.248s">So</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1761.289s">That's</a>  probably it, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1762.617s">It's</a>  a curiosity for me more than anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1764.278s">I</a>  just think that it's worth noting when we have facilities that are part of our city assets that if we can keep them up and then they bring other organizations into the city that pay rent. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1783.552s">And</a>  our pool is one of the things, the high school, tennis courts, various recreational facilities.</p>

    <p>[McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1789.895s">I</a>  would say this is one of those areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1792.317s">It's</a>  a very popular court. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1793.559s">It's</a>  always full. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1795.24s">It's</a>  seems to be very dedicated to tennis program. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1798.043s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1800.846s">You're</a>  welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1802.188s">And</a>  I'm hoping the bids coming under that too. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1803.809s">By</a>  the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1806.972s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1807.393s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1809.235s">Thank</a>  you, President Villes. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1811.973s">Um,</a>  I know that, um, when you look at the financial impacts to resurface, um, um, place that I know that our high school team uses that, uh, those courts and if <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1828.984s">those</a>  courts are not playable like in my profession where we've lost our courts for our high school team. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1836.291s">We</a>  then have to bus our high school teams off site to support their practices. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1844.658s">So</a>  I think that I know the high school uses it during the spring season. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1849.262s">I</a>  know that Kevin does use it a lot with <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1853.688s">with</a>  outside groups or with recreation groups that bring in funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1858.469s">So</a>  I think it's important that, especially as we're seeing pickleball grow, keeping tennis-only courts, especially when you're looking for a facility that is what placed it is, having, I believe, four courts, three or four courts. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1877.547s">you</a>  know, the programming to be dedicated to tennis and it doesn't, it's not interrupted like what you see at over at Duggar Park, which is a huge benefit, but it also has to, has to be shared. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1891.572s">So</a>  I think that's a huge piece to take in consideration, the money that's <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1899.848s">that's</a>  saved in the trickle down effect back to our budget when it comes down time to vote every little penny counts. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1906.57s">So</a>  I know that that's a huge benefit for our high school athletic program. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1912.111s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1915.792s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1917.833s">Any</a>  further questions, members of the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1922.174s">I</a>  don't want to bring up any third rails, but is this going to remain tennis only? <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1927.04s">or?</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1931.542s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1934.503s">Any</a>  questions by members of the public on the Placeland Park Tennis Court resurfacing? <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1943.447s">Seeing</a>  no hands on Zoom, no one in the chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1945.588s">Thank</a>  you, Commissioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1947.229s">You're</a>  welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1951.791s">Move</a>  next to Condon Shell Lighting Improvement.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1956.638s">And</a>  I'll speak on behalf of Director Bailey. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1959.501s">This</a>  is a project that was discussed at length with the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1964.185s">So</a>  we're very excited to see this project because what this will do will bring field lighting to the stage performance area of Condon Shell. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1972.353s">Currently,</a>  there are light fixtures there that are non-functioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1974.995s">So</a>  if the sun goes down, <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1977.163s">go</a>  home, the concert's over. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1979.045s">So</a>  this would extend the season as well as the daily usage of the Condon Shell for performances, which is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1986.212s">This</a>  would also install pathway lighting, as you can see in this picture here, the P5, P4, and P3, that's pathway lighting that leads from the parking lot area to the backside of the Condon Shell. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=1998.764s">Currently,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2000.345s">Actually,</a>  I even walked it this weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2001.845s">There's</a>  just string lights there. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2003.966s">As</a>  anybody who goes to the farmer's market knows that that's the lighting that they rely on for the late season farmer's market is string lighting. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2010.648s">So</a>  this would install permanent fixtures. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2013.389s">It</a>  would allow for the recreation department to manage it by a remote app. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2017.99s">So</a>  no more, oh, let me run down and unlock the door and flip the switch. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2021.791s">It's</a>  now boop. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2022.831s">So</a>  this would make it a heck of a lot more efficient for our recreation. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2026.836s">as</a>  well as just our city staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2030.519s">And</a>  I apologize, it does look like Director Bailey has a conflict, but if there are any questions, I can certainly try to answer them or take them back to Director Bailey and have them for our next regular meeting.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2044.007s">Thank</a>  you, Mayor Dupont. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2046.048s">I'll</a>  go to Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2049.891s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2051.152s">I'm</a>  so happy to see this on the agenda that we're going to entertain this because I think that safety is the biggest concern, especially what we're seeing for activities at the Shell, not just for shows or entertainment, but for our farmers market and the ability to light that area, I think is so important. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2073.65s">I</a>  think when you look at that, the other piece that you see is <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2078.453s">As</a>  a recreation employee, as soon as we went to to Moscow lighting, we realized the cost savings that directly came back to our city and our department because of the fact that with the old system of lighting. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2098.205s">1,</a>  it was archaic and to the. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2103.568s">understanding</a>  of someone sending somebody down to flick a switch and then come back later to flick the switch again would cost you four hours in overtime and that adds up believe it or not so musco lighting has been a godsend to municipalities so i think that it really saves <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2124.675s">when</a>  you look at finances and a hidden cost that really pays off at the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2130.042s">So</a>  I'm glad to see this and I would support it as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2133.707s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2139.775s">Thank</a>  you Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2141.237s">Councilor</a>  Leming.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2146.245s">Just</a>  looking at this, it says 98,285 on page 9, but I'm seeing 526 right below that on the construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2151.008s">The</a>  526 is for a playstead, so I apologize if there was an error. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2163.765s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2164.245s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2164.605s">So,</a>  yeah, I was thinking that that might have been a typo. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2168.767s">So</a>  just want to make sure that that's caught before it's referred to.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2176.85s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2177.31s">Yes,</a>  this was a document I prepared. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2179.591s">Our</a>  actual decision has the correct amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2182.052s">Thank</a>  you for catching that, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2185.433s">Yes,</a>  confirming 98285. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2186.114s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2190.868s">Any</a>  other questions for members of the Council on the Condon Shell? <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2197.914s">Seeing</a>  none, any questions from members of the public, either in person or on Zoom regarding the Condon Shell? <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2205.419s">Seeing</a>  none, we'll move to the next item we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2214.667s">Council</a>  Chamber Window Restoration. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2215.708s">Do</a>  you want to take that to the end or do you want to do it now?</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2219.707s">Maybe</a>  we can actually come back to that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2221.547s">Sorry,</a>  Paul, if you're listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2223.388s">That's</a>  just a re... It's a proposal to essentially move around funding sources to move it towards the CPA application. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2233.57s">So</a>  nothing has changed with that project. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2236.331s">And</a>  I'm sorry if we did wanna move on from it, but nothing has changed with the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2240.512s">It</a>  was just, it kind of aligned with CPA timeline to have it slide into our application round there. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2249.11s">saving</a>  the stabilization funds for being true emergency funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2252.154s">So</a>  it would be a consideration to rescind the initial request for stabilization funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2259.362s">And</a>  then I hate to use the word swap. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2261.564s">I've</a>  been trying to not say swap, but change the funding sources to be CPA.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2265.989s">Yeah,</a>  because this is a historic preservation project. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2268.873s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2269.424s">And</a>  it's in more alignment with the priorities of CPA, you know, it's true historic preservation. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2275.466s">So</a>  it aligns very well and it does free up that stabilization emergency funds for other, it just kind of all lined up really nicely in this regard, but it would- Using restricted money instead of unrestricted.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2288.669s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2289.449s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2289.87s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2293.293s">Do</a>  we have any questions on this one? <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2296.196s">And</a>  I just have a procedural note, but I'll wait till, do councilors have questions about this? <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2305.427s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2308.791s">Just</a>  one question. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2309.532s">Does</a>  it delay the work at all?</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2313.859s">minimally,</a>  maybe by a week or two, just because of the procedures. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2318.403s">I</a>  mean, if everything goes well today and next week, we hope to seek approval from this honorable body next Tuesday at the regular meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2325.449s">So</a>  just at that point, paperwork, so.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2327.631s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2330.674s">Is</a>  there anything, I'll go to Councilor Leming, and then I'll ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2335.258s">Go</a>  ahead, Councilor Leming.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2336.579s">Would</a>  we need to add into that a motion to rescind <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2341.482s">the</a>  money given from the stabilization funds along with that?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2346.35s">We're</a>  going to need to figure that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2347.712s">That</a>  was what I was going to bring up. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2349.254s">So</a>  we're going to need a separate letter from the mayor requesting that we rescind the appropriation of the stabilization fund money. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2358.481s">because</a>  you can't ask us to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2360.262s">No,</a>  I can't.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2361.263s">But</a>  it is a project that the CPC has recommended, so we wanted to continue that with our process here, but I will certainly work with the mayor on getting that well in time for next week.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2371.351s">Great,</a>  yeah, so that should just be a separate paper on our agenda, because it's an appropriation. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2375.854s">I</a>  do want to ask if the facilities manager, Paul Riggi, do you have anything you want to add to this?</p>

    <p>[Righi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2386.202s">No,</a>  I think Teresa has covered it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2389.705s">The</a>  vendor is patiently waiting to start. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2393.608s">So</a>  as soon as we give them the green light, they're going to get ready to mobilize and get those windows. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2401.294s">I</a>  think the picture that you're seeing kind of shows <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2406.759s">the</a>  condition of those windows, and I can't wait to bring them back to what they looked like when that chamber was built.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2417.263s">Thank</a>  you, Manager Reed. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2419.204s">And</a>  Paul, I have one other question. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2422.866s">Is</a>  this going to include, it's going to be restoration of the wood frame windows, does it also include <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2428.545s">the</a>  shades and that?</p>

    <p>[Righi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2430.906s">That</a>  is going to be a separate item, which I believe the mayor will be talking later about concerning obtaining some stabilization funding to do the shades and the curtains to bring them back to where they should also be. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2450.516s">Great,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2454.018s">Any</a>  further questions by members of the council on the window restoration? <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2462.822s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli, is your hand up for this?</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2466.585s">No,</a>  I apologize, Mr. President, it's left up, sorry.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2471.569s">Thank</a>  you, just wanted to make sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2473.47s">All</a>  right, on that note, is there any discussion by members of the public on this item? <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2480.436s">And</a>  I can't remember the meeting date, but we did go into a little bit more detail on this project in December or November.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2488.642s">Yeah,</a>  and we'll have those details in the memo.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2491.324s">Great,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cNtcjeG3bMI&t=2493.741s">Seeing</a>  none, we'll move on to the next item, which is our Shiloh Baptist Church ADA improvements phase two, 400,000.</p>
