25
00:10:08,091 --> 00:10:09,092

[SPEAKER_07]: There we go.

[SPEAKER_05]: The manager.

28
00:10:10,793 --> 00:10:11,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening.

29
00:10:11,293 --> 00:10:18,019
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much for your time in gathering today to hear about our fiscal 25 Community Preservation Act applications.

30
00:10:18,459 --> 00:10:26,325
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm joined a little bit on remote on Zoom as well as some lovely folks here in the room to discuss the merit of their applications.

31
00:10:26,966 --> 00:10:27,766
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a very brief

32
00:10:29,573 --> 00:10:41,462
[SPEAKER_07]: presentation just to kind of kick it off to share with everybody just to kind of acquaint folks with what CPA is all about and hopefully this will work well for me.

33
00:10:45,141 --> 00:10:45,481
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

34
00:10:46,122 --> 00:10:50,305
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, we're here today to talk about our fiscal 25 CPA applications annually.

35
00:10:50,705 --> 00:10:54,047
[SPEAKER_07]: We hold an application round where folks bring their projects to us.

36
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:55,909
[SPEAKER_07]: We weigh the applications.

37
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:57,590
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the next step.

38
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:04,795
[SPEAKER_07]: All of the applications that you're about to hear have been approved and recommended for funding by the CPC.

39
00:11:05,596 --> 00:11:11,200
[SPEAKER_07]: The next step for all who are listening is for appropriation requests to be approved by this body.

40
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:14,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a really quick recap on what CPA is.

41
00:11:14,742 --> 00:11:17,104
[SPEAKER_07]: It was voted in by ballot measure in November 2015.

42
00:11:17,224 --> 00:11:20,366
[SPEAKER_07]: We started seeing revenues generated in fiscal year 18.

43
00:11:20,526 --> 00:11:25,249
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a 1.5% surcharge on top of your taxes.

44
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:30,192
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not a huge bucket of money, but every year we bring in somewhere between 1.8 and $2 million.

45
00:11:33,354 --> 00:11:34,675
[SPEAKER_07]: some years more, some years less.

46
00:11:35,036 --> 00:11:44,123
[SPEAKER_07]: So to date, for the first six years that we've been funding projects, around here on the bottom, we've given out about $13.2 million, reinvesting back into the community.

47
00:11:45,682 --> 00:11:48,903
[SPEAKER_07]: So tonight, this is a very brief overview of the applications.

48
00:11:48,963 --> 00:11:51,144
[SPEAKER_07]: There are slides that kind of go into a little bit more detail here.

49
00:11:51,924 --> 00:12:00,046
[SPEAKER_07]: But overall, the applications that you'll be hearing tonight, Carr Park Phase 2 and Riverside Plaza, those were actually already approved by this honorable body earlier.

50
00:12:00,066 --> 00:12:04,608
[SPEAKER_07]: So you'll be hearing from the Affordable Housing Trust for their initial startup funding.

51
00:12:05,548 --> 00:12:08,549
[SPEAKER_07]: They have none, so this is just kind of an initial seed money, if you will.

52
00:12:09,422 --> 00:12:17,586
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be hearing from DPW Commissioner McGivern on the Oak Grove building restoration, as well as Playset Park Tennis Courts resurfacing project.

53
00:12:18,187 --> 00:12:22,909
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be joined by Director Bailey to speak on the condon shell lighting improvements.

54
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:26,451
[SPEAKER_07]: I will circle back on the council chamber window restoration.

55
00:12:26,771 --> 00:12:28,993
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a project that this body has heard before.

56
00:12:29,873 --> 00:12:31,654
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll explain that one when we get to that project.

57
00:12:31,674 --> 00:12:38,238
[SPEAKER_07]: We're also joined by our community members here at the Shiloh Baptist Church for phase two of their ADA improvements.

58
00:12:39,178 --> 00:12:51,767
[SPEAKER_07]: our friends at the Unitarian Universalist Church for exterior building restoration, some just siding work, if you will, as well as our partners at EBCD to continue the Medford Move-In program, which is a rental assistance program here in the city.

59
00:12:53,068 --> 00:12:54,909
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to pause to see if there's any initial questions.

60
00:12:54,949 --> 00:13:04,676
[SPEAKER_07]: Otherwise, I will go ahead and invite Aditi Mavor and Lisa Davidson from our housing trust to come up and speak about their project, if there were no questions.

61
00:13:06,037 --> 00:13:07,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Any questions by members of the council at this time?

62
00:13:10,742 --> 00:13:17,607
[SPEAKER_05]: seeing Councilor Lazzaro.

63
00:13:17,627 --> 00:13:21,190
[SPEAKER_06]: I am a member of the Unitarian Universalist Church of Medford.

64
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:25,313
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I should recuse myself from that portion of the discussion for tonight.

65
00:13:28,092 --> 00:13:28,933
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's fine.

66
00:13:29,994 --> 00:13:31,855
[SPEAKER_05]: You also don't stand to benefit personally from it.

67
00:13:31,935 --> 00:13:35,578
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's probably a mixed case, but it's fine.

68
00:13:36,038 --> 00:13:39,041
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll just mark you present when we vote on it.

69
00:13:39,881 --> 00:13:41,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we can sever that vote.

70
00:13:42,243 --> 00:13:45,766
[SPEAKER_07]: And just to clarify, we're not voting on recommendations tonight, correct?

71
00:13:45,806 --> 00:13:50,629
[SPEAKER_07]: That will be at the next regular city council or can we vote from- We're referring them to the regular meeting.

72
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:52,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I just wanted to clarify that.

73
00:13:52,211 --> 00:13:52,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

74
00:13:52,491 --> 00:13:52,811
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

75
00:13:52,931 --> 00:13:53,992
[SPEAKER_07]: It's only my second time doing this.

76
00:13:54,192 --> 00:13:55,193
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, you're doing great.

77
00:13:57,898 --> 00:14:00,100
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Teresa, for the brief introduction.

78
00:14:00,581 --> 00:14:02,422
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening, members of the City Council.

79
00:14:02,662 --> 00:14:03,563
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Aditi Mugur.

80
00:14:03,723 --> 00:14:05,605
[SPEAKER_01]: I staff the Affordable Housing Trust Fund.

81
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:07,967
[SPEAKER_01]: Joining with me this evening is Ms.

82
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:10,810
[SPEAKER_01]: Lisa Ann Davidson, who's the chair of the trust.

83
00:14:11,331 --> 00:14:13,513
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe vice chair, Ms.

84
00:14:13,713 --> 00:14:21,380
[SPEAKER_01]: Penelope Taylor is virtually present, along with Roberta Cameron, who's one of the trustees and also the CPC chairperson.

85
00:14:25,987 --> 00:14:30,028
[SPEAKER_01]: As you may be aware, Affordable Housing Trust Fund is a newly established board.

86
00:14:31,349 --> 00:14:38,291
[SPEAKER_01]: The ordinance to establish the Affordable Housing Trust Fund was adopted last year by the city council.

87
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:38,992
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

88
00:14:40,232 --> 00:14:47,675
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had our first Affordable Housing Trust monthly meeting in August last year, and so far we've had six monthly meetings.

89
00:14:48,495 --> 00:14:50,437
[SPEAKER_01]: We've made significant progress.

90
00:14:51,237 --> 00:14:58,303
[SPEAKER_01]: The trust is developing a five-year action plan to identify the city's affordable housing needs and priorities.

91
00:14:58,983 --> 00:15:02,626
[SPEAKER_01]: Since from October to December, the trust has

92
00:15:04,007 --> 00:15:07,888
[SPEAKER_01]: collected housing data information and done some preliminary analysis.

93
00:15:08,308 --> 00:15:20,292
[SPEAKER_01]: And last December and this January, the trust conducted two stakeholder engagement sessions to understand how affordable housing developers and housing stability and supportive service providers

94
00:15:22,453 --> 00:15:27,935
[SPEAKER_01]: understand the needs and of affordable housing developments and services in the city.

95
00:15:28,855 --> 00:15:33,656
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we plan to host a community engagement meeting in March.

96
00:15:34,297 --> 00:15:41,479
[SPEAKER_01]: And probably in mid or late summer, we plan to have the action plan finalized.

97
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:50,787
[SPEAKER_01]: The trust also signed the Declaration of Trust, which allows the trust to transfer or own property.

98
00:15:51,207 --> 00:15:55,171
[SPEAKER_01]: It also outlines the various rules and regulations of the trust.

99
00:15:56,733 --> 00:16:02,158
[SPEAKER_01]: End of this month or early Feb, we will record the Declaration of Trust at the Registry of Deeds.

100
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:10,026
[SPEAKER_01]: Here are some project examples that the trust is thinking about.

101
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:13,450
[SPEAKER_01]: These are not concrete projects.

102
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,272
[SPEAKER_01]: These are just potential examples.

103
00:16:15,513 --> 00:16:23,162
[SPEAKER_01]: As the trust finalizes the action plan, we'll have a more concrete understanding of what the projects are going to be in the next five years.

104
00:16:25,404 --> 00:16:31,845
[SPEAKER_01]: One project example is to explore development of affordable housing on city-owned parcels.

105
00:16:32,645 --> 00:16:35,206
[SPEAKER_01]: The trust could take two different approaches.

106
00:16:35,526 --> 00:16:47,988
[SPEAKER_01]: One is to seek a state grant that does site feasibility and pre-development work on city-owned parcels and also helps develop a request for proposals to solicit bids.

107
00:16:48,468 --> 00:16:51,768
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a technical assistance grant that values between $50,000 to $100,000.

108
00:16:54,969 --> 00:17:04,717
[SPEAKER_01]: To avail this grant, the local municipality has to provide a 10% cash match, so we are hoping to use CPA funds for this.

109
00:17:05,478 --> 00:17:16,867
[SPEAKER_01]: In case we are not successful in getting this grant, we hope to use CPA funds to do site feasibility pre-development work and solicit bids for affordable housing developments.

110
00:17:18,649 --> 00:17:32,638
[SPEAKER_01]: Another project example is to support the construction of new affordable housing, Medford Housing Authorities, Authority Community Development Corporations, Community Housing Development Organization, which is the Medford Community Housing.

111
00:17:33,418 --> 00:17:38,922
[SPEAKER_01]: They all have affordable housing projects, and we aim to support the construction of these projects.

112
00:17:39,962 --> 00:17:50,533
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have a community land trust yet, but currently we are doing a study on community land trust and we are hoping that moving forward we can support a potential land trust in its projects.

113
00:17:53,082 --> 00:17:56,964
[SPEAKER_01]: The third example is to build a fund to purchase land.

114
00:17:57,164 --> 00:18:08,330
[SPEAKER_01]: As I said, the declaration of trust allows the Board of Trustees to acquire and purchase land, so we're hoping that CPA funds can support this project.

115
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:17,395
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea is to acquire privately owned parcels, and that is adjoining city-owned parcels to sort of maximize the intensity and scale of the project.

116
00:18:18,355 --> 00:18:21,377
[SPEAKER_01]: The trust could also purchase existing affordable housing units.

117
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:29,326
[SPEAKER_01]: A third example is to provide down payment assistance to first-time homebuyers.

118
00:18:30,507 --> 00:18:35,310
[SPEAKER_01]: This is to support households whose income is at or below 100% AMI.

119
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:42,335
[SPEAKER_01]: And the last potential project would be to support rental assistance programs.

120
00:18:42,435 --> 00:18:43,476
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently, we have

121
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,531
[SPEAKER_01]: move in Medford.

122
00:18:46,352 --> 00:19:00,187
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the future, the trust will probably look at the existing rental assistance programs and identify what are the barriers and opportunities and may propose to redesign better rental assistance programs.

123
00:19:00,427 --> 00:19:04,952
[SPEAKER_01]: And we hope that CPA funds can be used to support these programs.

124
00:19:08,489 --> 00:19:20,880
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition to requesting CPA funds, the trust is looking at applying to Mass Housing Grant, as I mentioned earlier, to do some pre-development work on city-owned parcels.

125
00:19:21,721 --> 00:19:30,890
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's a developer payment coming through a project under Mystic Valley Development Commission.

126
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:32,731
[SPEAKER_01]: The project is 600 Rivers Edge.

127
00:19:32,891 --> 00:19:33,672
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have

128
00:19:35,882 --> 00:19:40,179
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have it in writing yet, but there are negotiations underway.

129
00:19:41,353 --> 00:19:53,278
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're hoping that through the zoning overhaul, we'll introduce a fractional payment as part of the inclusionary housing fee, and this could support the affordable housing trust fund.

130
00:19:53,938 --> 00:19:57,120
[SPEAKER_01]: And lastly, the affordable housing linkage.

131
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:04,723
[SPEAKER_01]: Once we do a next study, we hope to add affordable housing linkage as part of the existing linkage program.

132
00:20:05,063 --> 00:20:08,985
[SPEAKER_01]: These are some of the potential funding sources that the trust is looking into.

133
00:20:12,325 --> 00:20:17,948
[SPEAKER_01]: To sum up, this is a tentative budget breakdown of CPA funds.

134
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:25,611
[SPEAKER_01]: The CPA funds could be used for local cash match, and then for acquisition, construction, and support of affordable housing projects.

135
00:20:26,471 --> 00:20:40,658
[SPEAKER_01]: If we don't receive the grant, then we'll probably use approximately $80,000 to do feasibility study and pre-development work of city-owned parcels, and then the remaining funds for acquisition, construction, and support of affordable housing.

136
00:20:41,378 --> 00:20:46,719
[SPEAKER_01]: So in total, we are requesting $250,000 from CPC.

137
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:51,360
[SPEAKER_01]: We hope that this request is approved.

138
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,640
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for your time.

139
00:20:53,181 --> 00:20:56,281
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have any questions, we're happy to answer.

140
00:20:57,261 --> 00:20:57,822
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

141
00:20:57,842 --> 00:21:00,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have any questions from members of the council?

142
00:21:03,603 --> 00:21:04,223
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor...

143
00:21:07,862 --> 00:21:12,163
[SPEAKER_15]: No questions, just like to say I'm very glad to see this get up and running.

144
00:21:13,783 --> 00:21:19,185
[SPEAKER_15]: And I fully support the initial investment of the Affordable Housing Trust.

145
00:21:19,205 --> 00:21:21,125
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

146
00:21:22,405 --> 00:21:23,246
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Leming.

147
00:21:25,586 --> 00:21:28,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further questions from members of the Council or comments on this matter?

148
00:21:31,587 --> 00:21:33,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing none, are there any questions or comments from members of the public?

149
00:21:37,272 --> 00:21:38,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing none, thank you very much.

150
00:21:38,973 --> 00:21:39,393
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

151
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:43,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Next we'll move to the Oak Grove Cemetery building restoration phase two.

152
00:21:45,755 --> 00:21:52,538
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll note for applicants, you know, we appreciate the presentation, but you don't have to come with a PowerPoint.

153
00:21:53,822 --> 00:21:55,544
[SPEAKER_05]: We may have had a highly prepared group go first.

154
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:59,749
[SPEAKER_05]: We just want to hear about your project and be able to ask questions if needed.

155
00:21:59,849 --> 00:22:03,053
[SPEAKER_12]: So we'll go to the DPW commissioner, Tim McGivern.

156
00:22:03,414 --> 00:22:05,797
[SPEAKER_12]: President Bears, Councilors, good evening.

157
00:22:05,817 --> 00:22:07,779
[SPEAKER_12]: Tim McGivern, DPW commissioner.

158
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:10,943
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you have something you want to say?

159
00:22:10,983 --> 00:22:11,844
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just here to support you.

160
00:22:12,116 --> 00:22:13,297
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, okay, cool.

161
00:22:14,017 --> 00:22:16,138
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think you probably know a little bit about this project.

162
00:22:16,358 --> 00:22:22,641
[SPEAKER_12]: So we got this funded last year through the same mechanism that was to bring the project into design development.

163
00:22:23,001 --> 00:22:24,462
[SPEAKER_12]: So just a quick background.

164
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:32,446
[SPEAKER_12]: The two buildings on the cemetery site are historic and they also are pretty rundown and need a lot of work.

165
00:22:33,046 --> 00:22:37,308
[SPEAKER_12]: So we had a study performed to figure out what that scope of work actually is.

166
00:22:38,549 --> 00:22:39,771
[SPEAKER_12]: and prepared an estimate.

167
00:22:40,552 --> 00:22:45,740
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we sought money for continuing the design past conceptual into design.

168
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,886
[SPEAKER_12]: We got that, and that's being done right now as we speak.

169
00:22:51,709 --> 00:22:55,092
[SPEAKER_12]: And this request would complete the design process.

170
00:22:55,292 --> 00:23:01,618
[SPEAKER_12]: So if we add another $84,000 and change to the design process, that will bring us to construction documents.

171
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:08,704
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's what is known as shovel-ready documents, which are very useful to then seek construction funding.

172
00:23:09,684 --> 00:23:11,766
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't have it funded to be built yet.

173
00:23:14,475 --> 00:23:17,877
[SPEAKER_12]: has some early estimates in the $7.5 million zone.

174
00:23:17,917 --> 00:23:24,602
[SPEAKER_12]: So the set of plans that is constructible is very important, and this will take us there.

175
00:23:27,904 --> 00:23:28,324
[SPEAKER_12]: That's about it.

176
00:23:28,524 --> 00:23:30,025
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm happy to answer questions on that project.

177
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:31,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Commissioner.

178
00:23:31,946 --> 00:23:34,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Any questions on this project by members of the council?

179
00:23:39,711 --> 00:23:40,252
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing none.

180
00:23:43,342 --> 00:23:47,844
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wondered, Tim, and give me a minute to pull my records together.

181
00:23:51,005 --> 00:23:55,387
[SPEAKER_05]: From the first part of the project, OK, never mind.

182
00:23:55,447 --> 00:23:56,088
[SPEAKER_05]: It's answered right in here.

183
00:23:56,108 --> 00:23:59,449
[SPEAKER_05]: You're estimating $5 to $8 million for the restoration of, yeah.

184
00:23:59,689 --> 00:23:59,829
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep.

185
00:23:59,949 --> 00:24:05,632
[SPEAKER_12]: And we'll know a lot more after this milestone, because we'll have a design that can be cost estimated.

186
00:24:05,992 --> 00:24:06,252
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

187
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:13,075
[SPEAKER_05]: And is the idea, have you thought, have you had discussions about potential funding sources for the project?

188
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,641
[SPEAKER_12]: we have and getting some historic statuses cleaned up with the state.

189
00:24:17,441 --> 00:24:20,662
[SPEAKER_12]: So we'll be working on that, you know, as we kind of plug along here.

190
00:24:20,822 --> 00:24:21,022
[SPEAKER_12]: So.

191
00:24:21,303 --> 00:24:21,543
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

192
00:24:21,943 --> 00:24:22,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

193
00:24:24,784 --> 00:24:27,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing no questions on this project for members of the council.

194
00:24:27,945 --> 00:24:31,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there any questions by members of the public, either in the chamber or on zoom?

195
00:24:36,328 --> 00:24:36,768
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing none.

196
00:24:36,828 --> 00:24:37,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

197
00:24:37,488 --> 00:24:40,349
[SPEAKER_05]: Commissioner McGovern, we can move to ours.

198
00:24:40,449 --> 00:24:43,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Bailey's still in the parks commission meeting.

199
00:24:46,602 --> 00:24:49,224
[SPEAKER_07]: resurfacing was up while we still have Mr. McGivern.

200
00:24:49,505 --> 00:24:49,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, great.

201
00:24:49,845 --> 00:24:50,465
[SPEAKER_05]: You're on that one.

202
00:24:50,525 --> 00:24:51,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, fantastic.

203
00:24:52,447 --> 00:24:53,027
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we'll go to that.

204
00:24:53,228 --> 00:24:56,210
[SPEAKER_05]: And it says DPW, so that makes sense, too.

205
00:24:56,430 --> 00:25:01,495
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to present the project for Playset Park tennis court resurfacing for $526,000.

206
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:03,416
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely.

207
00:25:03,436 --> 00:25:04,717
[SPEAKER_12]: So this one is pretty simple.

208
00:25:05,118 --> 00:25:08,721
[SPEAKER_12]: The difference between similar projects in the past is this one is much larger.

209
00:25:09,281 --> 00:25:11,303
[SPEAKER_12]: The Playset courts are five tennis courts.

210
00:25:13,798 --> 00:25:15,520
[SPEAKER_12]: 22,000 square feet of tennis court.

211
00:25:16,061 --> 00:25:23,948
[SPEAKER_12]: So just using the cost to resurface something like that, you'll land in the 526,000 zone for an estimate.

212
00:25:24,829 --> 00:25:27,151
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's what this would do, would resurface that entire court.

213
00:25:27,672 --> 00:25:35,579
[SPEAKER_12]: If you've seen it recently, you know that there are large cracks developing in the court that are sort of detrimental to tennis play.

214
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:38,302
[SPEAKER_12]: It's one of our more popular areas for tennis.

215
00:25:39,937 --> 00:25:41,858
[SPEAKER_12]: and it doesn't have too much time left.

216
00:25:42,338 --> 00:25:53,422
[SPEAKER_12]: So the idea is to bring it back to life with new nets and fence, and we'll try to make a little, I'm gonna try to fix the parking lot a little bit while we're there.

217
00:25:54,102 --> 00:25:55,323
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's gonna be that project.

218
00:25:56,623 --> 00:25:59,224
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's the dirt parking area?

219
00:25:59,444 --> 00:26:07,827
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that kind of ruts out all the time, and I'm gonna try to, while we have all kinds of paving equipment there, I'm gonna see if we can add a little bit onto it and see if we can fix it up a bit.

220
00:26:09,092 --> 00:26:10,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Any questions by members of the council?

221
00:26:10,575 --> 00:26:14,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Callahan and then Councilor Lazzaro.

222
00:26:16,108 --> 00:26:17,130
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Councilor Scarpelli.

223
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:18,062
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

224
00:26:18,182 --> 00:26:18,803
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello.

225
00:26:19,103 --> 00:26:19,603
[SPEAKER_13]: Great to see you.

226
00:26:20,623 --> 00:26:30,569
[SPEAKER_13]: I am curious, just because of the information I know about our roads, that once they get past a certain deterioration rate, then they become a lot more expensive to repair.

227
00:26:31,209 --> 00:26:33,010
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm curious about tennis courts.

228
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:44,216
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there that kind of a lifecycle where they should be repaired within a certain number of years, and then it becomes more expensive, only noticing that this is the most expensive item on our list?

229
00:26:44,236 --> 00:26:46,137
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm curious if that's something that we

230
00:26:46,797 --> 00:26:49,540
[SPEAKER_13]: could pay less for in the future by repairing them earlier?

231
00:26:50,921 --> 00:26:51,521
[SPEAKER_12]: Possibly.

232
00:26:52,422 --> 00:26:52,863
[SPEAKER_12]: Possibly.

233
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:58,508
[SPEAKER_12]: But my experience thus far has been the cracks begin to develop.

234
00:26:58,528 --> 00:27:03,092
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you seal them, like we tried at what the heck was the park?

235
00:27:03,952 --> 00:27:04,493
[SPEAKER_12]: Barry Park.

236
00:27:04,971 --> 00:27:10,673
[SPEAKER_12]: at Barrie Park, you run into different problems that make it difficult to play.

237
00:27:10,954 --> 00:27:14,475
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a difference between bouncing a ball on the surface and driving the car over it.

238
00:27:14,955 --> 00:27:28,641
[SPEAKER_12]: So when we do preventative maintenance on asphalt, which we'll talk about later, we're doing things like crack sealing and patching, box out patching, which leaves seams and kind of protects the surface for longer as it degrades.

239
00:27:29,181 --> 00:27:31,842
[SPEAKER_12]: But with playable surfaces, especially tennis,

240
00:27:33,923 --> 00:27:39,625
[SPEAKER_12]: quality of the surface comes right through the cracks that usually begin in the base.

241
00:27:40,245 --> 00:27:48,087
[SPEAKER_12]: So to summarize, we have tried to just recondition the surfaces and we just end up with bigger problems down the line.

242
00:27:48,687 --> 00:27:58,590
[SPEAKER_12]: So once these large cracks develop, it indicates that there's a problem much deeper, a foot or two or more down in the pavement itself, in the base of the pavement.

243
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:12,402
[SPEAKER_12]: So really the only way to resolve that and have a nice playing surface worth the money that you're going to spend on it is to pulverize the asphalt, recompact, regrade, and put a new surface on the top.

244
00:28:13,403 --> 00:28:13,803
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you so much.

245
00:28:13,823 --> 00:28:14,444
[SPEAKER_12]: You're welcome.

246
00:28:14,944 --> 00:28:15,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

247
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:17,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lazzaro and then Councilor Skripal and Councilor Lazzaro.

248
00:28:18,702 --> 00:28:19,623
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for presenting this.

249
00:28:20,383 --> 00:28:21,464
[SPEAKER_06]: They are in pretty rough shape.

250
00:28:21,764 --> 00:28:23,005
[SPEAKER_06]: I've played there every once in a while.

251
00:28:23,065 --> 00:28:23,726
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very fun.

252
00:28:23,826 --> 00:28:27,068
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a great asset to our community, so I'm glad we're addressing it.

253
00:28:27,108 --> 00:28:32,612
[SPEAKER_06]: I was wondering if you could speak to, you may not have these numbers, but since it does mention in the report that

254
00:28:34,053 --> 00:28:37,236
[SPEAKER_06]: It's rented by outside organizations.

255
00:28:37,356 --> 00:28:46,485
[SPEAKER_06]: So this being something I think we should keep in mind that this is an expensive item, but it is also an income generating item.

256
00:28:46,966 --> 00:28:50,690
[SPEAKER_06]: So it does make sense for us to put more money into it.

257
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:52,451
[SPEAKER_06]: It's bringing money into the community.

258
00:28:52,852 --> 00:28:58,017
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know how much money it like these courts rent for or how much it brings in?

259
00:28:58,577 --> 00:28:59,317
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

260
00:28:59,598 --> 00:29:01,619
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that's handled through the rec department.

261
00:29:01,779 --> 00:29:02,879
[SPEAKER_12]: Is Kevin here?

262
00:29:02,899 --> 00:29:04,460
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if he could answer that question.

263
00:29:05,261 --> 00:29:05,481
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.

264
00:29:05,681 --> 00:29:07,382
[SPEAKER_12]: But if you see him later, he might be able to answer that.

265
00:29:08,322 --> 00:29:12,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe for our next time talking about it, it'll have to be at the regular meeting, too, right?

266
00:29:12,124 --> 00:29:13,825
[SPEAKER_06]: So that could.

267
00:29:13,845 --> 00:29:14,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

268
00:29:14,626 --> 00:29:17,687
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think there's a Parks Commission meeting happening in room 201 that he's in.

269
00:29:17,747 --> 00:29:19,208
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not 100% sure.

270
00:29:19,248 --> 00:29:19,869
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah.

271
00:29:21,289 --> 00:29:22,330
[SPEAKER_05]: That's probably it, yeah.

272
00:29:22,617 --> 00:29:24,258
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a curiosity for me more than anything.

273
00:29:24,278 --> 00:29:43,532
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think that it's worth noting when we have facilities that are part of our city assets that if we can keep them up and then they bring other organizations into the city that pay rent.

274
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:49,357
[SPEAKER_06]: And our pool is one of the things, the high school, tennis courts, various recreational facilities.

275
00:29:49,895 --> 00:29:52,017
[SPEAKER_12]: I would say this is one of those areas.

276
00:29:52,317 --> 00:29:53,519
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a very popular court.

277
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:54,279
[SPEAKER_12]: It's always full.

278
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,463
[SPEAKER_12]: It's seems to be very dedicated to tennis program.

279
00:29:58,043 --> 00:30:00,646
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you.

280
00:30:00,846 --> 00:30:01,307
[SPEAKER_12]: You're welcome.

281
00:30:02,188 --> 00:30:03,689
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm hoping the bids coming under that too.

282
00:30:03,809 --> 00:30:04,430
[SPEAKER_12]: By the way.

283
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:07,313
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

284
00:30:07,393 --> 00:30:09,175
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Scarpelli.

285
00:30:09,235 --> 00:30:10,957
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President Villes.

286
00:30:11,973 --> 00:30:27,403
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I know that, um, when you look at the financial impacts to resurface, um, um, place that I know that our high school team uses that, uh, those courts and if

287
00:30:28,984 --> 00:30:35,830
[SPEAKER_11]: those courts are not playable like in my profession where we've lost our courts for our high school team.

288
00:30:36,291 --> 00:30:44,558
[SPEAKER_11]: We then have to bus our high school teams off site to support their practices.

289
00:30:44,658 --> 00:30:49,242
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that I know the high school uses it during the spring season.

290
00:30:49,262 --> 00:30:52,525
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that Kevin does use it a lot with

291
00:30:53,688 --> 00:30:58,409
[SPEAKER_11]: with outside groups or with recreation groups that bring in funding.

292
00:30:58,469 --> 00:31:14,834
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think it's important that, especially as we're seeing pickleball grow, keeping tennis-only courts, especially when you're looking for a facility that is what placed it is, having, I believe, four courts, three or four courts.

293
00:31:17,547 --> 00:31:31,492
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, the programming to be dedicated to tennis and it doesn't, it's not interrupted like what you see at over at Duggar Park, which is a huge benefit, but it also has to, has to be shared.

294
00:31:31,572 --> 00:31:38,355
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that's a huge piece to take in consideration, the money that's

295
00:31:39,848 --> 00:31:46,510
[SPEAKER_11]: that's saved in the trickle down effect back to our budget when it comes down time to vote every little penny counts.

296
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:51,951
[SPEAKER_11]: So I know that that's a huge benefit for our high school athletic program.

297
00:31:52,111 --> 00:31:53,032
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you.

298
00:31:55,792 --> 00:31:56,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

299
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:59,553
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further questions, members of the council?

300
00:32:02,174 --> 00:32:05,795
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to bring up any third rails, but is this going to remain tennis only?

301
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:07,180
[SPEAKER_05]: or?

302
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,561
[SPEAKER_12]: The direction I have right now is that it's tennis only.

303
00:32:09,841 --> 00:32:10,662
Okay, great.

304
00:32:11,542 --> 00:32:11,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

305
00:32:14,503 --> 00:32:19,025
[SPEAKER_05]: Any questions by members of the public on the Placeland Park Tennis Court resurfacing?

306
00:32:23,447 --> 00:32:25,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing no hands on Zoom, no one in the chamber.

307
00:32:25,588 --> 00:32:26,889
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Commissioner.

308
00:32:27,229 --> 00:32:27,649
[SPEAKER_05]: You're welcome.

309
00:32:31,791 --> 00:32:34,212
[SPEAKER_05]: Move next to Condon Shell Lighting Improvement.

310
00:32:36,638 --> 00:32:39,461
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll speak on behalf of Director Bailey.

311
00:32:39,501 --> 00:32:43,164
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a project that was discussed at length with the committee.

312
00:32:44,185 --> 00:32:51,672
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're very excited to see this project because what this will do will bring field lighting to the stage performance area of Condon Shell.

313
00:32:52,353 --> 00:32:54,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Currently, there are light fixtures there that are non-functioning.

314
00:32:54,995 --> 00:32:56,196
[SPEAKER_07]: So if the sun goes down,

315
00:32:57,163 --> 00:32:58,685
[SPEAKER_07]: go home, the concert's over.

316
00:32:59,045 --> 00:33:05,491
[SPEAKER_07]: So this would extend the season as well as the daily usage of the Condon Shell for performances, which is great.

317
00:33:06,212 --> 00:33:18,363
[SPEAKER_07]: This would also install pathway lighting, as you can see in this picture here, the P5, P4, and P3, that's pathway lighting that leads from the parking lot area to the backside of the Condon Shell.

318
00:33:18,764 --> 00:33:19,184
[SPEAKER_07]: Currently,

319
00:33:20,345 --> 00:33:21,805
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I even walked it this weekend.

320
00:33:21,845 --> 00:33:23,206
[SPEAKER_07]: There's just string lights there.

321
00:33:23,966 --> 00:33:30,608
[SPEAKER_07]: As anybody who goes to the farmer's market knows that that's the lighting that they rely on for the late season farmer's market is string lighting.

322
00:33:30,648 --> 00:33:32,448
[SPEAKER_07]: So this would install permanent fixtures.

323
00:33:33,389 --> 00:33:37,830
[SPEAKER_07]: It would allow for the recreation department to manage it by a remote app.

324
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:41,731
[SPEAKER_07]: So no more, oh, let me run down and unlock the door and flip the switch.

325
00:33:41,791 --> 00:33:42,391
[SPEAKER_07]: It's now boop.

326
00:33:42,831 --> 00:33:46,012
[SPEAKER_07]: So this would make it a heck of a lot more efficient for our recreation.

327
00:33:46,836 --> 00:33:48,257
[SPEAKER_07]: as well as just our city staff.

328
00:33:50,519 --> 00:34:02,966
[SPEAKER_07]: And I apologize, it does look like Director Bailey has a conflict, but if there are any questions, I can certainly try to answer them or take them back to Director Bailey and have them for our next regular meeting.

329
00:34:04,007 --> 00:34:06,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mayor Dupont.

330
00:34:06,048 --> 00:34:07,169
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll go to Councilor Scarpelli.

331
00:34:09,891 --> 00:34:10,712
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

332
00:34:11,152 --> 00:34:33,630
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm so happy to see this on the agenda that we're going to entertain this because I think that safety is the biggest concern, especially what we're seeing for activities at the Shell, not just for shows or entertainment, but for our farmers market and the ability to light that area, I think is so important.

333
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:36,752
[SPEAKER_11]: I think when you look at that, the other piece that you see is

334
00:34:38,453 --> 00:34:58,185
[SPEAKER_11]: As a recreation employee, as soon as we went to to Moscow lighting, we realized the cost savings that directly came back to our city and our department because of the fact that with the old system of lighting.

335
00:34:58,205 --> 00:35:01,287
[SPEAKER_11]: 1, it was archaic and to the.

336
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:21,234
[SPEAKER_11]: understanding of someone sending somebody down to flick a switch and then come back later to flick the switch again would cost you four hours in overtime and that adds up believe it or not so musco lighting has been a godsend to municipalities so i think that it really saves

337
00:35:24,675 --> 00:35:30,002
[SPEAKER_11]: when you look at finances and a hidden cost that really pays off at the end.

338
00:35:30,042 --> 00:35:33,667
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm glad to see this and I would support it as well.

339
00:35:33,707 --> 00:35:34,248
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you.

340
00:35:39,775 --> 00:35:40,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you Councilor Scarpelli.

341
00:35:41,237 --> 00:35:41,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Leming.

342
00:35:46,245 --> 00:35:50,948
[SPEAKER_15]: Just looking at this, it says 98,285 on page 9, but I'm seeing 526 right below that on the construction.

343
00:35:51,008 --> 00:35:54,270
[SPEAKER_15]: The 526 is for a playstead, so I apologize if there was an error.

344
00:36:03,765 --> 00:36:04,105
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

345
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:04,525
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

346
00:36:04,605 --> 00:36:08,347
[SPEAKER_15]: So, yeah, I was thinking that that might have been a typo.

347
00:36:08,767 --> 00:36:16,210
[SPEAKER_15]: So just want to make sure that that's caught before it's referred to.

348
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:17,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

349
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:19,451
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, this was a document I prepared.

350
00:36:19,591 --> 00:36:22,012
[SPEAKER_07]: Our actual decision has the correct amount.

351
00:36:22,052 --> 00:36:23,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for catching that, Councilor.

352
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,054
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, confirming 98285.

353
00:36:26,114 --> 00:36:26,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

354
00:36:30,868 --> 00:36:34,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other questions for members of the Council on the Condon Shell?

355
00:36:37,914 --> 00:36:42,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing none, any questions from members of the public, either in person or on Zoom regarding the Condon Shell?

356
00:36:45,419 --> 00:36:53,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing none, we'll move to the next item we have.

357
00:36:54,667 --> 00:36:55,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Council Chamber Window Restoration.

358
00:36:55,708 --> 00:36:57,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to take that to the end or do you want to do it now?

359
00:36:59,707 --> 00:37:01,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we can actually come back to that one.

360
00:37:01,547 --> 00:37:02,748
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, Paul, if you're listening.

361
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:13,510
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just a re... It's a proposal to essentially move around funding sources to move it towards the CPA application.

362
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:15,491
[SPEAKER_07]: So nothing has changed with that project.

363
00:37:16,331 --> 00:37:20,432
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm sorry if we did wanna move on from it, but nothing has changed with the project.

364
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:27,974
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just, it kind of aligned with CPA timeline to have it slide into our application round there.

365
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:32,073
[SPEAKER_07]: saving the stabilization funds for being true emergency funds.

366
00:37:32,154 --> 00:37:39,322
[SPEAKER_07]: So it would be a consideration to rescind the initial request for stabilization funds.

367
00:37:39,362 --> 00:37:41,524
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I hate to use the word swap.

368
00:37:41,564 --> 00:37:45,949
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been trying to not say swap, but change the funding sources to be CPA.

369
00:37:45,989 --> 00:37:48,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because this is a historic preservation project.

370
00:37:48,873 --> 00:37:49,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

371
00:37:49,424 --> 00:37:54,125
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's in more alignment with the priorities of CPA, you know, it's true historic preservation.

372
00:37:55,466 --> 00:38:08,589
[SPEAKER_07]: So it aligns very well and it does free up that stabilization emergency funds for other, it just kind of all lined up really nicely in this regard, but it would- Using restricted money instead of unrestricted.

373
00:38:08,669 --> 00:38:09,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.

374
00:38:09,449 --> 00:38:09,709
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.

375
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:10,390
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

376
00:38:13,293 --> 00:38:16,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have any questions on this one?

377
00:38:16,196 --> 00:38:22,324
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just have a procedural note, but I'll wait till, do councilors have questions about this?

378
00:38:25,427 --> 00:38:26,649
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lazzaro.

379
00:38:28,791 --> 00:38:29,492
[SPEAKER_06]: Just one question.

380
00:38:29,532 --> 00:38:32,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Does it delay the work at all?

381
00:38:33,859 --> 00:38:38,303
[SPEAKER_07]: minimally, maybe by a week or two, just because of the procedures.

382
00:38:38,403 --> 00:38:45,429
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if everything goes well today and next week, we hope to seek approval from this honorable body next Tuesday at the regular meeting.

383
00:38:45,449 --> 00:38:47,531
[SPEAKER_07]: So just at that point, paperwork, so.

384
00:38:47,631 --> 00:38:50,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

385
00:38:50,674 --> 00:38:54,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there anything, I'll go to Councilor Leming, and then I'll ask.

386
00:38:55,258 --> 00:38:56,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead, Councilor Leming.

387
00:38:56,579 --> 00:38:59,762
[SPEAKER_15]: Would we need to add into that a motion to rescind

388
00:39:01,482 --> 00:39:05,308
[SPEAKER_15]: the money given from the stabilization funds along with that?

389
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:07,672
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to need to figure that out.

390
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:08,833
[SPEAKER_05]: That was what I was going to bring up.

391
00:39:09,254 --> 00:39:15,864
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to need a separate letter from the mayor requesting that we rescind the appropriation of the stabilization fund money.

392
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:19,742
[SPEAKER_05]: because you can't ask us to do that.

393
00:39:20,262 --> 00:39:20,743
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I can't.

394
00:39:21,263 --> 00:39:31,130
[SPEAKER_07]: But it is a project that the CPC has recommended, so we wanted to continue that with our process here, but I will certainly work with the mayor on getting that well in time for next week.

395
00:39:31,351 --> 00:39:35,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, yeah, so that should just be a separate paper on our agenda, because it's an appropriation.

396
00:39:35,854 --> 00:39:44,680
[SPEAKER_05]: I do want to ask if the facilities manager, Paul Riggi, do you have anything you want to add to this?

397
00:39:46,202 --> 00:39:49,564
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I think Teresa has covered it.

398
00:39:49,705 --> 00:39:52,407
[SPEAKER_10]: The vendor is patiently waiting to start.

399
00:39:53,608 --> 00:40:00,974
[SPEAKER_10]: So as soon as we give them the green light, they're going to get ready to mobilize and get those windows.

400
00:40:01,294 --> 00:40:05,918
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the picture that you're seeing kind of shows

401
00:40:06,759 --> 00:40:15,443
[SPEAKER_10]: the condition of those windows, and I can't wait to bring them back to what they looked like when that chamber was built.

402
00:40:17,263 --> 00:40:19,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Manager Reed.

403
00:40:19,204 --> 00:40:20,965
[SPEAKER_05]: And Paul, I have one other question.

404
00:40:22,866 --> 00:40:27,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this going to include, it's going to be restoration of the wood frame windows, does it also include

405
00:40:28,545 --> 00:40:30,406
[SPEAKER_05]: the shades and that?

406
00:40:30,906 --> 00:40:49,516
[SPEAKER_10]: That is going to be a separate item, which I believe the mayor will be talking later about concerning obtaining some stabilization funding to do the shades and the curtains to bring them back to where they should also be.

407
00:40:50,516 --> 00:40:51,237
[SPEAKER_10]: Great, thank you.

408
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:57,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further questions by members of the council on the window restoration?

409
00:41:02,822 --> 00:41:04,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli, is your hand up for this?

410
00:41:06,585 --> 00:41:10,588
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I apologize, Mr. President, it's left up, sorry.

411
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:12,670
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, just wanted to make sure.

412
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:18,454
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, on that note, is there any discussion by members of the public on this item?

413
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:28,182
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can't remember the meeting date, but we did go into a little bit more detail on this project in December or November.

414
00:41:28,642 --> 00:41:31,184
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and we'll have those details in the memo.

415
00:41:31,324 --> 00:41:32,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, thank you.

416
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:39,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing none, we'll move on to the next item, which is our Shiloh Baptist Church ADA improvements phase two, 400,000.

417
00:41:41,364 --> 00:41:49,388
[SPEAKER_07]: We are joined today by Mr. Cliff Singleton, who's the project manager, as well as Mr. Bill McIntyre, who is a representative of the church.

418
00:41:49,728 --> 00:41:50,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

419
00:41:50,068 --> 00:41:52,089
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to turn the pulpit over to you, gentlemen.

420
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:54,370
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much, councilors.

421
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:55,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to both of you.

422
00:41:55,671 --> 00:42:01,673
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't had the pleasure to go before you before, so any hiccups, let me know.

423
00:42:02,014 --> 00:42:02,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

424
00:42:03,842 --> 00:42:24,405
[SPEAKER_09]: What we're doing here at Shiloh, we're following up on a project that we started last year, and that was to gain accessibility to the lower section of Shiloh Baptist Church with a elevator, and that will allow us to have a daycare put into that facility that will serve the community.

425
00:42:25,686 --> 00:42:33,247
[SPEAKER_09]: And also the community occasionally has meetings with other churches and local people.

426
00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:38,662
[SPEAKER_09]: So that will do a good number of things at one time with short money.

427
00:42:39,763 --> 00:42:41,945
[SPEAKER_09]: We have gone through the design phase.

428
00:42:43,206 --> 00:42:44,387
[SPEAKER_09]: We deleted the building.

429
00:42:45,108 --> 00:42:54,717
[SPEAKER_09]: All the other monies that came last year, we've spent most of that for design, some legal work, some CPA work.

430
00:42:55,177 --> 00:42:58,300
[SPEAKER_09]: So all the things are there for construction.

431
00:42:59,177 --> 00:43:01,958
[SPEAKER_09]: So the design is pretty much finished.

432
00:43:02,378 --> 00:43:09,000
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll just have to probably go to a little sharpening or pencil and come to your building department.

433
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:13,141
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we're really ready to go, which is a nice feeling.

434
00:43:13,821 --> 00:43:19,523
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope that we will be in favor here to continue this project on and so forth.

435
00:43:19,583 --> 00:43:28,105
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that the daycare is a needed facility in that area and that the experienced

436
00:43:29,432 --> 00:43:36,918
[SPEAKER_09]: daycare person who wants to rent that facility is here, not in this facility, but ready to go.

437
00:43:36,938 --> 00:43:38,499
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

438
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:51,270
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would say that the term of starting the construction is your approvals and some minor building kinds of things that will probably have to be done with the building department.

439
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:54,773
[SPEAKER_09]: So those are the things that we have here today.

440
00:43:55,727 --> 00:44:01,070
[SPEAKER_09]: The church body itself is ready to support whatever effort is needed.

441
00:44:01,651 --> 00:44:03,212
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's where we are today.

442
00:44:03,652 --> 00:44:04,873
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have any questions?

443
00:44:06,313 --> 00:44:08,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have any questions by members of the Council?

444
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:16,540
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll go to Councilor Leming.

445
00:44:19,293 --> 00:44:23,957
[SPEAKER_15]: No questions again, but I just like to say, I'm glad to see this happening.

446
00:44:23,977 --> 00:44:30,663
[SPEAKER_15]: Glad to see a space being made for a daycare and afterschool programs and welcome to city hall.

447
00:44:31,123 --> 00:44:31,483
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

448
00:44:34,206 --> 00:44:34,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

449
00:44:34,666 --> 00:44:34,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

450
00:44:34,946 --> 00:44:36,447
[SPEAKER_05]: And seeing no other questions from the council.

451
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:37,528
[SPEAKER_05]: I also just want to say.

452
00:44:37,568 --> 00:44:39,290
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, I'm sorry, my hand was up.

453
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:40,371
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scarpelli.

454
00:44:42,305 --> 00:45:10,630
[SPEAKER_11]: no i apologize i put it up and down so many times i just wanted to make sure that miss dupont just uh just share with the public i know that we've had some questions in the past and i had an email today just that people were questioning whether um how does this fit as if it's not a city facility this is something that i support as a historical building in our community and trying to enhance that and make sure we we provide assistance any way we can to

455
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:31,320
[SPEAKER_11]: to make sure the Shallow Baptist and I believe the Unitarian Church as well that people understand that there are criteria that we follow that but legally we can use our CPA funds to assist in projects like this.

456
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,221
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that the question that I had today was

457
00:45:35,122 --> 00:45:57,483
[SPEAKER_11]: they weren't against any of these uh the the churches personally but the question was if the tax money is uh is it going to a city owned facility that's what they were confused in so i know that i know if miss dupont can expand expand on that a little bit i know that there are some legalities that show that it absolutely fits into this um

458
00:45:58,124 --> 00:46:12,176
[SPEAKER_11]: this criteria and we're not violating any legal issues, but I just wanted to make sure we had clarification on that because I want to make sure that there's no negativity behind any of these projects.

459
00:46:12,216 --> 00:46:21,364
[SPEAKER_11]: I think they're all worthwhile and in my mind fit the scope of historical and I would support it a thousand percent.

460
00:46:21,384 --> 00:46:22,405
[SPEAKER_11]: But just for that fact,

461
00:46:23,046 --> 00:46:29,716
[SPEAKER_11]: if we can share any information that would help clear some questions some residents that have asked.

462
00:46:30,977 --> 00:46:31,258
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

463
00:46:37,325 --> 00:46:38,726
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

464
00:46:38,926 --> 00:46:51,350
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, well, I would like to first say that what CPA stands for is Community Preservation Act, and I don't think we should define community by whether it's city owned or publicly owned.

465
00:46:51,830 --> 00:46:59,593
[SPEAKER_07]: It's where we all gather, and churches were one of the original gathering places for communities, if not the only community gathering place.

466
00:46:59,633 --> 00:47:04,695
[SPEAKER_07]: So to address the question here of the legality of tax funding going towards religious

467
00:47:05,995 --> 00:47:06,876
[SPEAKER_07]: organizations.

468
00:47:07,416 --> 00:47:16,221
[SPEAKER_07]: We recognize it as a community space and we're happy to reinvest that funding back in so that the taxpayers of Medford can benefit from it as a public benefit.

469
00:47:17,642 --> 00:47:27,548
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll also share just to address any specific questions that we put into our conditions of funding that no funding can be used in the restoration of

470
00:47:28,448 --> 00:47:29,949
[SPEAKER_07]: for instance, religious imagery.

471
00:47:30,729 --> 00:47:38,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Shiloh Baptist had also, and in other communities, CPA funding has been used to restore many church elements.

472
00:47:38,873 --> 00:47:42,394
[SPEAKER_07]: Perhaps if we look at stained glass, how many stained glass windows you guys have there?

473
00:47:43,015 --> 00:47:43,895
[SPEAKER_07]: Quite a few, right?

474
00:47:44,475 --> 00:47:49,438
[SPEAKER_07]: But the funding cannot be used for any stained glass that has religious imagery or anything like that.

475
00:47:50,734 --> 00:48:06,731
[SPEAKER_09]: Because the architect, basically, when he was designing the project, talked a little bit with historical people, because we wanted the addition to be pretty much what the historical society would want if they wanted a facility.

476
00:48:07,171 --> 00:48:10,274
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're not really addressing any of the windows or anything else.

477
00:48:10,615 --> 00:48:13,698
[SPEAKER_09]: So the design will be compatible with what is there.

478
00:48:14,555 --> 00:48:18,560
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, that's kind of boilerplate language with other communities as well.

479
00:48:19,201 --> 00:48:25,410
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a very good question, and I'm glad that you raised it, Councilor Scarpelli, because it's important for everybody to understand.

480
00:48:25,915 --> 00:48:26,696
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I appreciate it.

481
00:48:26,716 --> 00:48:27,897
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that there really weren't.

482
00:48:27,977 --> 00:48:30,340
[SPEAKER_11]: It wasn't about just the facility that it was.

483
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:31,121
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a church.

484
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:32,442
[SPEAKER_11]: It was that focus.

485
00:48:32,482 --> 00:48:42,453
[SPEAKER_11]: The question was that if it's not a city facility, but I appreciate that answer being that defining that a community exactly what the title title is about.

486
00:48:42,493 --> 00:48:44,395
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you for clarifying that.

487
00:48:44,415 --> 00:48:46,377
[SPEAKER_11]: And I hope that residents.

488
00:48:47,518 --> 00:48:55,420
[SPEAKER_11]: feel that that's adequate because I think it sure fits the purpose that I believe.

489
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:55,980
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you.

490
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:57,740
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

491
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:58,320
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

492
00:48:58,760 --> 00:48:59,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

493
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:00,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

494
00:49:00,281 --> 00:49:07,202
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just wanted to add as well, I think it's a great project and serving a lot of community benefit out of it.

495
00:49:07,262 --> 00:49:11,003
[SPEAKER_05]: I know daycare and childcare is so essential.

496
00:49:11,503 --> 00:49:14,523
[SPEAKER_05]: And so to have that space be available for that is really wonderful.

497
00:49:15,404 --> 00:49:16,544
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also hope it brings

498
00:49:17,674 --> 00:49:22,098
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of improvements to the building as well for all the other uses that people use it for.

499
00:49:22,118 --> 00:49:23,118
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

500
00:49:23,639 --> 00:49:24,019
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

501
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:25,360
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

502
00:49:27,502 --> 00:49:28,022
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

503
00:49:29,483 --> 00:49:35,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Next, we will go to the UU Church exterior restoration.

504
00:49:35,268 --> 00:49:35,248
$99,000.

505
00:49:36,409 --> 00:49:42,373
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll advance my slide, but I'm joined by Ms.

506
00:49:42,473 --> 00:49:44,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Liz Ammons from the UU Church.

507
00:49:44,555 --> 00:49:44,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

508
00:49:44,875 --> 00:49:45,096
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

509
00:49:45,116 --> 00:49:45,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

510
00:49:47,591 --> 00:49:53,173
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, thank you for carrying this this far with our CPA grant.

511
00:49:53,553 --> 00:50:00,355
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I'll pick up on what Councilor Scarpelli was talking about, what's the benefit to the city and to the community.

512
00:50:01,275 --> 00:50:07,377
[SPEAKER_00]: And the funding that we're applying for is to make significant repairs

513
00:50:08,217 --> 00:50:10,878
[SPEAKER_00]: that are restorative on the outside of the church.

514
00:50:11,399 --> 00:50:13,560
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll just touch on three things.

515
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:20,443
[SPEAKER_00]: One, the church is a really important historical landmark in Medford architecturally.

516
00:50:20,864 --> 00:50:25,086
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an 1894 late Gothic revival structure.

517
00:50:25,566 --> 00:50:30,429
[SPEAKER_00]: It has an immense, gorgeous stained glass window facing High Street.

518
00:50:30,849 --> 00:50:36,091
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a block from the library, so it's in a prominent location in Medford Square.

519
00:50:37,112 --> 00:50:44,796
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for the architectural historicity of the building, it's really important to keep it preserved in Medford.

520
00:50:45,296 --> 00:50:51,739
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second thing is that it's also historically, culturally very important in Medford.

521
00:50:52,119 --> 00:50:57,121
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the direct descendant of the first church in Medford, the Puritan Church, which was built in 1696.

522
00:50:57,701 --> 00:51:05,064
[SPEAKER_00]: It, in the 19th century, was a prominent center of abolitionist activity.

523
00:51:05,684 --> 00:51:09,145
[SPEAKER_00]: Lydia Maria Child grew up in the church, George Luther Stearns.

524
00:51:09,945 --> 00:51:15,206
[SPEAKER_00]: who recruited the famous 54th and 55th regiments, was a member of the church.

525
00:51:16,427 --> 00:51:20,948
[SPEAKER_00]: It was active in women's suffrage and the temperance movement.

526
00:51:21,888 --> 00:51:25,649
[SPEAKER_00]: 20th century, the church was active in the civil rights movement.

527
00:51:25,669 --> 00:51:29,490
[SPEAKER_00]: The Reverend Eugene Adams marched with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

528
00:51:30,650 --> 00:51:43,914
[SPEAKER_00]: And that legacy has continued into the present of the church being a place that is embracing various community issues and causes and important agendas.

529
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:54,537
[SPEAKER_00]: So the third thing I want to say, in addition to the architectural importance and the cultural importance historically of the church, is its benefit to the community today.

530
00:51:55,437 --> 00:51:57,498
[SPEAKER_00]: The church provides space

531
00:51:58,778 --> 00:52:03,660
[SPEAKER_00]: rent-free to the community-covered food pantry and has done that for almost 30 years.

532
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:11,363
[SPEAKER_00]: It's open every Thursday to families in need, serves 70 to 90 clients every week.

533
00:52:11,704 --> 00:52:16,506
[SPEAKER_00]: It rents at very low cost space to AA, to Al-Anon,

534
00:52:18,075 --> 00:52:24,837
[SPEAKER_00]: There are contra dancers, there's a community orchestra that uses the space, Tai Chi class uses the space.

535
00:52:25,177 --> 00:52:30,098
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a space that is available to the community and is really used by the community.

536
00:52:30,458 --> 00:52:47,523
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those reasons, we are delighted to have the opportunity to apply for CPA restoration funds so the church can continue to be important historically to the city and in a contemporary way to the community.

537
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:51,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Wonderful, thank you so much.

538
00:52:53,592 --> 00:52:56,213
[SPEAKER_05]: Any questions or comments by members of the council?

539
00:52:58,594 --> 00:52:59,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Leming.

540
00:53:03,637 --> 00:53:04,238
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Liz.

541
00:53:04,498 --> 00:53:05,719
[SPEAKER_15]: Wonderful presentation.

542
00:53:06,219 --> 00:53:07,120
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm glad to see this.

543
00:53:08,181 --> 00:53:09,582
[SPEAKER_15]: Glad to see this coming for the council.

544
00:53:10,422 --> 00:53:16,626
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, just if you could clarify, Council President Bears, since your comment earlier indicated you might know something about this.

545
00:53:16,666 --> 00:53:24,172
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm actually also a member of the EAU Church, just like Councilor Lazzaro.

546
00:53:24,192 --> 00:53:25,753
[SPEAKER_15]: Could you clarify sort of the

547
00:53:28,035 --> 00:53:38,427
[SPEAKER_15]: ethics issues behind behind this, if any, or like you mentioned that we could still vote on this, because we're not personally benefiting by this even if we are members of the church.

548
00:53:38,988 --> 00:53:40,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean I think it's pretty.

549
00:53:41,498 --> 00:53:50,881
[SPEAKER_05]: The standard test is, do you or any immediate family members or associates stand to benefit financially from your vote?

550
00:53:52,842 --> 00:53:55,043
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't, I mean, that's your call.

551
00:53:55,063 --> 00:53:55,983
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

552
00:53:57,103 --> 00:54:05,326
[SPEAKER_05]: But unless you are going to be hired by the UU Church to do door restoration or someone in your family, which I don't think

553
00:54:05,983 --> 00:54:06,704
[SPEAKER_05]: either of you are.

554
00:54:07,184 --> 00:54:09,286
[SPEAKER_05]: I've attended a couple of services myself.

555
00:54:09,586 --> 00:54:11,627
[SPEAKER_05]: I plan to vote on this.

556
00:54:12,648 --> 00:54:15,190
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's generally the test.

557
00:54:15,350 --> 00:54:19,073
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't feel comfortable with it, I think we have the quorum and the votes to move forward without you.

558
00:54:20,554 --> 00:54:25,638
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, you're not receiving a personal benefit from this project.

559
00:54:26,838 --> 00:54:27,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

560
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:30,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lazzaro, and you could check with the Ethics Commission.

561
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:32,721
[SPEAKER_05]: If you wanted to ask them, you could ask them.

562
00:54:33,181 --> 00:54:34,582
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to ask prior to a vote.

563
00:54:34,702 --> 00:54:39,004
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you abstain tonight, you could ask them in advance of the vote at the regular meeting.

564
00:54:40,185 --> 00:54:46,308
[SPEAKER_05]: You could review their regulations online or review the conflict of interest and ethics trainings that we all have to take every year.

565
00:54:47,309 --> 00:54:50,370
[SPEAKER_05]: But generally, I think you're in the clear on this one.

566
00:54:50,491 --> 00:54:51,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lazzaro.

567
00:54:52,316 --> 00:54:54,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think my impulse was sort of an abundance of caution.

568
00:54:55,478 --> 00:54:57,119
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think you're right.

569
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:04,724
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will probably abstain tonight, but this isn't the vote to finally, finally approve.

570
00:55:04,804 --> 00:55:07,666
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's probably not a big deal.

571
00:55:08,687 --> 00:55:17,353
[SPEAKER_06]: And just as an example, the mayor abstained from a vote in which her sister was maybe standing to

572
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:21,982
[SPEAKER_06]: benefit directly financially from something that she would have voted on.

573
00:55:22,042 --> 00:55:24,564
[SPEAKER_06]: So that seems like a clear situation.

574
00:55:24,604 --> 00:55:31,849
[SPEAKER_06]: In this case, it would just be, this is actually a very community-like repair work.

575
00:55:31,909 --> 00:55:34,370
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a financial benefit to us.

576
00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:34,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, yeah.

577
00:55:34,951 --> 00:55:38,173
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, unless you were being hired to do the work itself.

578
00:55:39,494 --> 00:55:41,395
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really the only way I could see this being an issue.

579
00:55:43,845 --> 00:55:50,808
[SPEAKER_05]: An example I can give you, in 2020, I and my family, my parents and I had invested in Medford Brewing Company.

580
00:55:51,428 --> 00:56:03,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Prior to that, we had to, I called the ethics commission, we had to divest and sell our investments in order to, for me to vote on the brewpub ordinance because it would have benefited the, because we were investors.

581
00:56:04,453 --> 00:56:07,534
[SPEAKER_05]: But this, I know it's a church, it's a nonprofit organization.

582
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:08,915
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not shareholders.

583
00:56:11,305 --> 00:56:14,368
[SPEAKER_05]: you're not paid by the organization, nor will you be paid for the work.

584
00:56:14,588 --> 00:56:17,671
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's my general interpretation.

585
00:56:22,375 --> 00:56:22,615
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

586
00:56:22,856 --> 00:56:26,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other questions on the Unitarian University Church's exterior restoration?

587
00:56:29,162 --> 00:56:32,745
[SPEAKER_05]: By members of the council, seeing none, any thoughts, comments, questions by members of the public?

588
00:56:36,798 --> 00:56:43,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Also seeing none, we can move to the last item, which is ABCD move-in assistance.

589
00:56:44,082 --> 00:56:51,285
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, we are joined today by Ntando Dubey and Joshua White from Action for Boston Community Development, ABCD.

590
00:56:51,726 --> 00:56:59,150
[SPEAKER_07]: They're our regional nonprofit organization partner that helps with housing assistance, as well as fuel assistance.

591
00:56:59,210 --> 00:56:59,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Gosh, what else do you do?

592
00:57:00,490 --> 00:57:01,611
[SPEAKER_07]: A little bit of everything.

593
00:57:02,191 --> 00:57:04,172
[SPEAKER_02]: So, good evening members of the council.

594
00:57:04,692 --> 00:57:16,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, my name is Joshua white I am the director of housing and homelessness prevention for ABC Boston to my left is Patando Dube, who is my deputy director, it is my pleasure to speak with you tonight about the Medford move in program.

595
00:57:17,697 --> 00:57:28,845
[SPEAKER_02]: whose goal is to provide rental assistance to households that either live in the city of Medford or looking to move into the city of Medford that are at or below 100% AMI.

596
00:57:30,306 --> 00:57:34,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Specifically, it would be to provide first and last month's rent.

597
00:57:35,629 --> 00:57:43,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Our goal would be to serve at least 19 households in the city with a cap of $4,000 per household.

598
00:57:45,436 --> 00:57:54,602
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition to the rental assistance, they would also be receiving counseling services through our support services department, which is part of housing and homeless prevention.

599
00:57:55,302 --> 00:58:04,407
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also they may be eligible for other services at ABCD Boston, like fuel assistance, healthcare, childcare, workforce development, and so on and so on.

600
00:58:04,768 --> 00:58:06,088
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is why we are here today.

601
00:58:07,669 --> 00:58:08,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

602
00:58:08,510 --> 00:58:11,792
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll go to Councilor Lazzaro.

603
00:58:12,012 --> 00:58:13,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lazzaro and then Councilor Caput.

604
00:58:14,791 --> 00:58:15,496
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for being here.

605
00:58:15,516 --> 00:58:15,918
[SPEAKER_06]: I have

606
00:58:17,732 --> 00:58:18,892
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a great program.

607
00:58:18,932 --> 00:58:26,114
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that can be a very prohibitive thing for families, the startup costs of moving, relocating.

608
00:58:27,314 --> 00:58:37,056
[SPEAKER_06]: If you are exiting homelessness, just the beginning, the first month of payments can be really difficult to overcome.

609
00:58:38,217 --> 00:58:39,677
[SPEAKER_06]: So this sounds like a great program.

610
00:58:39,857 --> 00:58:44,478
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to ask if there are programs in other communities that you're aware of where

611
00:58:45,158 --> 00:58:55,128
[SPEAKER_06]: the community, the municipality, will cover these costs through different avenues, or if you offer this kind of programming in other cities?

612
00:58:55,148 --> 00:58:56,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Out of curiosity.

613
00:58:56,609 --> 00:58:57,310
[SPEAKER_02]: We do, we do.

614
00:58:57,370 --> 00:59:00,953
[SPEAKER_02]: We currently offer these types of programs within the Mystic Valley itself.

615
00:59:01,774 --> 00:59:05,097
[SPEAKER_02]: We are trying to offer these services in the city of Boston.

616
00:59:05,498 --> 00:59:07,920
[SPEAKER_02]: That has been a challenge, but we are making some inroads.

617
00:59:09,934 --> 00:59:17,377
[SPEAKER_06]: I heard recently about broker fees being less of an issue soon, maybe, hopefully, or now, I'm not sure.

618
00:59:18,237 --> 00:59:22,139
[SPEAKER_06]: But that seems promising, because that can also be problematic for people.

619
00:59:23,379 --> 00:59:26,361
[SPEAKER_06]: But this seems like a really, really good program and a really good use of our funds.

620
00:59:26,461 --> 00:59:28,262
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you for your work.

621
00:59:28,482 --> 00:59:28,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

622
00:59:29,922 --> 00:59:31,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

623
00:59:35,567 --> 00:59:36,708
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks so much for the work that you do.

624
00:59:36,768 --> 00:59:37,529
[SPEAKER_13]: It's really important.

625
00:59:38,429 --> 00:59:47,196
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted a quick, for the record, for folks listening, can you let us know what 100% of AMI is in Bedford?

626
00:59:47,777 --> 00:59:48,017
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyone?

627
00:59:48,397 --> 00:59:49,218
[SPEAKER_13]: I know it's area median.

628
00:59:49,318 --> 00:59:51,680
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just going to look it up, and then I was like, maybe the public should know, too.

629
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:55,323
[SPEAKER_13]: But off the top of your head, nobody knows.

630
00:59:55,343 --> 01:00:04,029
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's a, don't quote me, I can probably get the numbers exactly for you, but I want to say it's 150-ish per family.

631
01:00:08,495 --> 01:00:10,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it is it is it regional?

632
01:00:10,096 --> 01:00:10,556
[SPEAKER_13]: I was looking up.

633
01:00:10,576 --> 01:00:11,677
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't find it instantly.

634
01:00:11,737 --> 01:00:21,324
[SPEAKER_13]: So, We don't have to stop the meeting for that.

635
01:00:21,364 --> 01:00:23,225
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just, I just thought it'd be interesting information.

636
01:00:23,245 --> 01:00:23,805
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all.

637
01:00:23,825 --> 01:00:24,066
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks.

638
01:00:29,209 --> 01:00:32,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Um well, any other questions or comments by members of the

639
01:00:36,586 --> 01:00:40,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing none, I just have one, this is our third year?

640
01:00:40,227 --> 01:00:42,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Third year in a row we're doing the move-in program?

641
01:00:42,448 --> 01:00:43,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, thank you.

642
01:00:45,728 --> 01:00:46,129
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

643
01:00:48,769 --> 01:00:50,010
[SPEAKER_05]: That's for a family of four.

644
01:00:50,390 --> 01:00:56,011
[SPEAKER_07]: For a family of four, which is kind of the standard, or a single occupant, is 114.

645
01:01:05,732 --> 01:01:06,672
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I go ahead and stop sharing now?

646
01:01:13,035 --> 01:01:13,375
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

647
01:01:13,535 --> 01:01:15,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that is the conclusion.

648
01:01:17,917 --> 01:01:27,642
[SPEAKER_05]: We'd either make a motion to refer, someone could make a motion to refer this to the regular meeting, and you guys could abstain if you want, or we could sever it.

649
01:01:28,282 --> 01:01:34,425
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to make sure Councilor Lazzaro and Leming feel comfortable.

650
01:01:34,605 --> 01:01:34,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

651
01:01:35,418 --> 01:01:41,203
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll move to refer everything but the UU paper severed.

652
01:01:41,263 --> 01:01:46,967
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a motion by Councilor Callahan, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro, and I'll go to Councilor Leming for discussion.

653
01:01:47,427 --> 01:01:50,830
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I... You were just gonna do the same thing.

654
01:01:51,090 --> 01:02:01,038
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, no, I was, well, I was just gonna say, like, I'm personally comfortable voting yes on it, but just to align with Councilor Lazzaro and keep consistency, I'm just gonna abstain.

655
01:02:01,578 --> 01:02:06,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay if you're both abstaining then I need a second from Councilor Tseng Collins or Scarpelli.

656
01:02:06,442 --> 01:02:06,882
[SPEAKER_11]: Second.

657
01:02:07,963 --> 01:02:17,571
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Councilor Callahan, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli to sever off the UU.

658
01:02:18,512 --> 01:02:22,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk please call the roll and refer to the regular meeting.

659
01:02:27,448 --> 01:02:33,193
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a vote to just take the UU project out and advance it to the regular meeting.

660
01:02:35,094 --> 01:02:37,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Just the UU and then everything else.

661
01:02:37,957 --> 01:02:38,177
Great.

662
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:45,123
[SPEAKER_03]: Sever UU and then refer everything else to the council.

663
01:02:45,163 --> 01:02:48,385
[SPEAKER_05]: This is to sever UU and refer UU to the regular meeting.

664
01:02:51,568 --> 01:02:53,429
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we'll vote on everything else in the motion.

665
01:02:56,312 --> 01:02:56,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

666
01:03:13,372 --> 01:03:13,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

667
01:03:13,832 --> 01:03:15,053
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Leming.

673
01:03:25,419 --> 01:03:26,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli.

674
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:27,000
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

01:03:28,281 --> 01:03:28,801

[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

679
01:03:31,923 --> 01:03:33,944
[SPEAKER_05]: By the affirmative, two present, the motion passes.

680
01:03:34,685 --> 01:03:38,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a motion to refer the remaining papers to the regular meeting?

681
01:03:38,962 --> 01:03:43,111
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion of council, I'm going to refer the remaining by council Lazzaro.

682
01:03:43,813 --> 01:03:44,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

683
01:04:13,907 --> 01:04:17,368
[SPEAKER_05]: It was, uh, Councilor Leming and Councilor Lazzaro was the second.

684
01:04:19,449 --> 01:04:20,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

685
01:04:20,629 --> 01:04:25,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Calderon?

686
01:04:25,890 --> 01:04:26,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Collins?

687
01:04:27,311 --> 01:04:27,551
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

688
01:04:28,631 --> 01:04:29,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Lazzaro?

689
01:04:29,151 --> 01:04:29,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

Councilor Tseng?

695
01:04:37,353 --> 01:04:37,653
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

696
01:04:39,493 --> 01:04:39,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

697
01:04:39,753 --> 01:04:41,554
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, from the negative, the motion passes.

698
01:04:42,745 --> 01:04:44,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else anyone would like to add?

699
01:04:44,726 --> 01:04:46,306
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a big thank you, if I may.

700
01:04:46,646 --> 01:04:47,327
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate it.

701
01:04:47,347 --> 01:04:53,469
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the culmination of a year's work of the committee, so we appreciate very much your support of these projects.

702
01:04:54,109 --> 01:04:59,771
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody's left, but thanks, Mr. McGovern, and thank you to the church for coming to help support us.

01:04:59,811 --> 01:05:00,751
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you very much.

[SPEAKER_05]: If folks want to come on Zoom, that's fine.

707
01:05:07,294 --> 01:05:08,894
[SPEAKER_05]: We won't be asking questions.

708
01:05:09,514 --> 01:05:10,755
[SPEAKER_05]: People don't have to take the time out.

709
01:05:11,735 --> 01:05:27,012
