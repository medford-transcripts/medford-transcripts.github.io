1
00:00:00,291 --> 00:00:04,932
a draft proposal for the West Medford zoning proposal.

2
00:00:04,972 --> 00:00:08,233
This is the very first time we'll be looking at a preliminary proposal.

3
00:00:08,253 --> 00:00:14,654
It is by no means the last time we'll be looking at this proposal before it proceeds along in the process.

4
00:00:15,395 --> 00:00:29,418
The object of tonight is to review a presentation giving us an overview of the proposal by NS Associates that will acquaint us with the boundaries of the West Medford Square zoning district.

5
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:43,053
preliminary proposals for which areas, which blocks should be which sub-districts and why the goals of this zoning and how that aligns with the overall goals of the comprehensive citywide zoning project.

6
00:00:44,638 --> 00:00:53,824
Folks who have been regularly attending this meetings will know this already, but the West Medford Square and also the Medford Square proposal also still in progress.

7
00:00:54,304 --> 00:01:02,970
These two proposals follow on the heels of kind of a more general discussion of our approach to commercial and mixed use, sorry, mixed use areas in the city.

8
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:10,895
I think about a month ago, we held an initial discussion on a commercial framework for the remaining corridors and squares throughout Medford.

9
00:01:12,617 --> 00:01:18,319
There was a lot of public comment on that kind of bird's eye view, 30,000 foot view discussion.

10
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:35,925
One comment that we did hear quite frequently, I think, in my opinion, was that people were very specifically asking for height and density in West Medford Square to support it as a more vibrant commercial square to piggyback off of its kind of unique location with the commuter rail stop.

11
00:01:38,226 --> 00:01:56,297
And it's true of West Medford Square as it is with the rest of this citywide zoning project that I think wherever we look as we kind of look all around the city to do these updates and these re-evaluations, our goal is to preserve what we love about these places, preserve the uniqueness of each of these space, each square, each corridor, each neighborhood.

12
00:01:57,858 --> 00:02:04,221
and to make sure that we're preserving what we love about those places, but not down zoning everywhere.

13
00:02:04,261 --> 00:02:08,063
We know that we need development, we need to support development, we need to vastly increase housing.

14
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:14,906
So we're looking to do that in each square, in each corridor, in each neighborhood in a way that is tailored to each square, corridor, neighborhood.

15
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:19,268
So that applies to West Medford Square as it does to each of our zoning topics.

16
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:39,584
Before I hand it over to Paula I just wanted to mention because I know there are folks who are attending tonight who are maybe new to this process, because they're West Medford residents or business owners who haven't been involved in the zoning overhaul process previously just to state this in the context of the rest of the kind of the arc of the overhaul.

17
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:52,388
This proposal, this draft proposal, this draft proposal process for West Medford Square has been preceded by many other topics in the Citywide Zoning Review timeline.

18
00:02:53,168 --> 00:02:58,770
The first package that the City Council ordained was the Mystic Avenue Corridor District that was back last fall.

19
00:02:59,793 --> 00:03:11,760
We then followed by ordaining a green score rubric, which updates environmental and climate resiliency related incentives and rewards for rewards for developers and major building projects.

20
00:03:12,841 --> 00:03:15,723
We ordained the Salem Street corridor district.

21
00:03:17,955 --> 00:03:27,658
Currently in process is the neighborhood and urban residential zoning topic, which is going to have its second date before the Community Development Board this month, I believe.

22
00:03:28,558 --> 00:03:31,039
Medford Square zoning proposal is also in progress.

23
00:03:31,119 --> 00:03:35,560
It's still in this committee and updates to the ADU ordinance is still in progress.

24
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,621
It has not yet been referred out of this committee either.

25
00:03:38,841 --> 00:03:49,751
So this is one piece of a citywide process, and we welcome everybody's participation and involvement in as much of this project interests them.

26
00:03:52,294 --> 00:04:04,385
With that, Paola, if there's no initial comments from any of my fellow councilors or from city staff, I'd love to turn it over to Paola to begin her presentation about the draft West Medford Square zoning proposal.

27
00:04:08,747 --> 00:04:09,127
Oh, great.

28
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:11,249
And I see that Councillor Scarpelli is with us as well.

29
00:04:14,512 --> 00:04:15,773
Council Vice President, thank you.

30
00:04:16,114 --> 00:04:17,155
Sorry for my tardiness.

31
00:04:20,878 --> 00:04:21,459
Thank you for being here.

32
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:22,359
All right.

33
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:30,747
Seeing no hands raised and the chambers are on zoom for my fellow Councillors, I'll turn it over to Paola whenever you're ready to begin the presentation.

34
00:04:40,385 --> 00:04:41,206
Hello, everyone.

35
00:04:41,326 --> 00:04:42,086
Thank you very much.

36
00:04:43,027 --> 00:04:44,227
I'm Paola Ramos-Martinez.

37
00:04:44,308 --> 00:04:48,470
I'm senior urban designer and planner at Ines Associates.

38
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:57,016
And today, virtually, is with me Jimmy Rocha, spatial analyst, as well as at Ines Associates.

39
00:04:58,376 --> 00:05:00,097
I will share my screen.

40
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:37,495
So we will be looking today at, we will read the process, the timeline, the 2025, the phase two that we are doing now, all those opportunities for public comments that we repeat every meeting in case there's anyone new to the process.

41
00:05:38,756 --> 00:05:43,657
We will do a little introduction of what we are doing and why.

42
00:05:45,118 --> 00:05:52,247
And we are right now looking at the mixed use districts, all the commercial framework that we have explained.

43
00:05:52,267 --> 00:05:59,696
Sorry, at a previous meeting, and we will be looking today, specifically was met for the square.

44
00:06:00,577 --> 00:06:02,658
Um, big disclaimer.

45
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:09,559
Everything that we're showing today is still in discussion, especially for West Medford Square.

46
00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:13,080
We will be looking at the first proposal.

47
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:21,722
We are waiting for your comments from everyone from the city staff, City Council and the public.

48
00:06:23,022 --> 00:06:30,385
So we can integrate that into our first proposal and we will come back with an integrated proposal.

49
00:06:31,886 --> 00:06:42,089
We also show certain sections that will explain exactly what you will be seeing, but also those are just examples of what could be there.

50
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:48,452
It's not a proposal, a specific proposal or anything like that.

51
00:06:48,512 --> 00:06:48,872
It's just

52
00:06:49,572 --> 00:06:53,355
to understand what are the possibilities and the opportunities in the area.

53
00:06:55,136 --> 00:07:10,286
So we are in the third phase of this project of this rezoning of Medford based on the comprehensive plan that was done or that was published in 2022.

54
00:07:11,927 --> 00:07:14,629
Today we will be looking at West Medford Square.

55
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:19,293
Um, these are in the planning and permitting committee meetings.

56
00:07:19,373 --> 00:07:22,876
Then we are also doing the city boards, community development boards.

57
00:07:23,616 --> 00:07:27,159
We had recently just presented the residential districts.

58
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:39,329
We will be going back to the city board, um, to propose, um, to adjust the proposal with the comments that we've heard in the last meeting.

59
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:46,213
Um, and we are also doing some public Q and a sessions we did in.

60
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:50,256
I think one week ago two weeks ago.

61
00:07:50,656 --> 00:07:53,658
We did the residential neighborhoods.

62
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:59,202
Um, so we're also implementing those comments in the proposal for the next city board.

63
00:07:59,963 --> 00:08:03,385
Um, and we will have we have updated the timeline.

64
00:08:04,745 --> 00:08:09,707
For May 8th, we will have the squares and ADU.

65
00:08:09,807 --> 00:08:19,009
So we will be talking the 8th of May about Medford Square, West Medford Square and the ADUs.

66
00:08:19,349 --> 00:08:22,350
So there is a chance for the public to participate.

67
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:31,694
The 29th of May, we will be looking at any other corridor that we will address, like Main Street, for example.

68
00:08:32,975 --> 00:08:39,437
And then in June 9th, we will be talking about parking and starting the TDM discussion.

69
00:08:40,238 --> 00:08:49,982
So if anyone is interested, those will be public meetings where we will try to solve as much as possible any question about those topics.

70
00:08:52,452 --> 00:08:55,255
Um, I'm just going to go a little bit.

71
00:08:56,196 --> 00:09:02,401
We can talk about this if anyone has any comments about this or questions here.

72
00:09:02,421 --> 00:09:09,427
I'm just going to say that these are all the opportunities that the public has to tell us their opinion on these matters.

73
00:09:09,527 --> 00:09:13,151
We have we always presented City Council at least twice.

74
00:09:13,671 --> 00:09:14,031
the city Council.

75
00:09:14,051 --> 00:09:19,615
Um first as we will do today with West Medford Square, we will come with a proposal.

76
00:09:20,176 --> 00:09:28,042
Um then we get the comments from first comments from the public city staff and City Council, and we will come back with, um.

77
00:09:29,643 --> 00:09:31,064
Like amended proposal.

78
00:09:31,764 --> 00:09:34,146
Um then that if that gets voted from the city

79
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:54,751
to comment from the public and then the city board can refer back to the city council and that is the other opportunity back to the city council for people to talk about it and give their opinion until that is passed.

80
00:09:56,172 --> 00:09:56,353
Um.

81
00:09:57,453 --> 00:09:58,554
So as I said, we are.

82
00:09:58,755 --> 00:10:12,386
We took the comprehensive, um, plan that Medford released in January 2023 and the climate action adaptation plan and other plants that were addressed before this one's on.

83
00:10:12,406 --> 00:10:17,130
We're taking everything that has to do with zoning on implementing those changes.

84
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,612
So this is what this process is about.

85
00:10:21,093 --> 00:10:35,158
This was the vision and it was divided in quarters, residential squares, and then some institutional anchors, the residential density, low and high density, and transformational areas.

86
00:10:35,478 --> 00:10:38,539
So we are taking from this base vision map.

87
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,741
We are working on each of these topics.

88
00:10:42,801 --> 00:10:46,922
So right now we're working on the mixed use districts.

89
00:10:47,883 --> 00:10:48,623
We've passed

90
00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:56,212
Salem, Salem Street and Mystic Avenue.

91
00:10:56,472 --> 00:10:58,953
Those two are already passed.

92
00:11:00,434 --> 00:11:10,959
We are working last time we were in the planning committee meeting, we talked about Medford Square, the first proposal.

93
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,141
And right now we will talk about West Medford.

94
00:11:16,846 --> 00:11:23,368
So if we look at the existing, we will be looking at West Medford Square.

95
00:11:24,449 --> 00:11:34,733
Here we have the most, this is the current and existing zoning and what is possible at this moment.

96
00:11:35,733 --> 00:11:59,597
um the violet line is the commuter the trail um sorry the rail tracks um we have high street the greenish lines are the bus lines um and so what is allowed in this the districts that we have right now are commercial one this allows by right six stories high

97
00:12:01,778 --> 00:12:16,549
and it allows as residential buildings, commercial buildings four-story by right, and then other permitted structures are 15 stories by right, which is I think only hotels.

98
00:12:18,993 --> 00:12:26,475
General residential, that is the orange color, that is for single and two units.

99
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:33,657
And then the yellow, very light yellow, that is single family, only single unit dwellings.

100
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:41,778
And then we have apartment one, and that is this coral, reddish orangey color.

101
00:12:42,699 --> 00:12:45,179
And that is apartment one, that is three stories by right.

102
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:48,160
So this is what is existing at the moment.

103
00:12:49,661 --> 00:12:49,881
Um.

104
00:12:51,162 --> 00:12:56,365
These are the, um the minimum dimensions that are required.

105
00:12:57,626 --> 00:13:03,109
And as we can see here is the hotel is 15 stories by right with C one.

106
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:04,230
Um.

107
00:13:05,511 --> 00:13:10,995
Then multiple dwelling is six stories by right only residential and then other permitted

108
00:13:15,197 --> 00:13:15,357
Um.

109
00:13:16,598 --> 00:13:17,898
And this will be the proposal.

110
00:13:17,978 --> 00:13:24,401
So we are still using same districts as we use for the other square for, um, Medford Square.

111
00:13:25,121 --> 00:13:29,623
We don't have here any mixed use one, so we go and mixed use three.

112
00:13:29,703 --> 00:13:37,666
So we only use mixed use two, and that is the two different ones which we have mixed use to a and mixed use to be.

113
00:13:38,466 --> 00:13:41,047
Um and then we use urban residential to.

114
00:13:43,066 --> 00:13:47,330
What we want to do here is to expand the possibility of mixed use.

115
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:51,253
Right now it's really concentrated along High Street.

116
00:13:51,773 --> 00:14:00,260
We want to extend the possibility to enlarge that and also follow the tracks

117
00:14:01,561 --> 00:14:07,544
with mixed use also because we can go a little bit higher and along the tracks.

118
00:14:08,905 --> 00:14:17,450
So we are enlarging that possibility for more business in ground floor and the height for the residential.

119
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:24,495
So we have mixed use to A, that is the blue, and that would be four stories by right.

120
00:14:24,935 --> 00:14:28,899
And then we always have these plus two with incentive zoning.

121
00:14:29,419 --> 00:14:42,830
And that means that if they give something, if the developer gives something back to the community, and that is from a list of a menu that we have, and that can be affordable housing, it can be a square, it can be

122
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:48,294
Spocket Park or some things that are more for this area.

123
00:14:49,195 --> 00:14:51,296
We will work on that later on.

124
00:14:53,358 --> 00:14:58,962
Then they could add two more stories to the buildings.

125
00:14:59,663 --> 00:15:03,566
So four plus two will be six in total with incentive zoning.

126
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:10,489
then we would have mixed use 2B and this is six stories by right plus two with incentive zoning.

127
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:14,091
This means eight, but it has to be with incentive zoning.

128
00:15:14,492 --> 00:15:19,614
So what we wanted is also not to go below what is there right now.

129
00:15:19,714 --> 00:15:22,236
So those six stories by right to be maintained.

130
00:15:23,196 --> 00:15:26,998
So in that case, we would need to go to mixed use 2B.

131
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:43,391
And then we have urban residential, which we can have townhouses, three-unit dwelling, multiplex, multiple-unit dwelling, more than six units, and the ADUs that we will look into this for one, two, and three units.

132
00:15:44,953 --> 00:15:51,578
In this case, we are using urban residential, too, as four stories by right.

133
00:15:54,458 --> 00:16:05,388
Um, so we are going to look as we have done for the other areas, some sections of the different streets in this area and how that would look like.

134
00:16:06,849 --> 00:16:21,202
The more brownish neutral color that is the existing at this moment, and then the new proposals, we have different colors and use these reddish for the commercial, usually in ground floor.

135
00:16:22,143 --> 00:16:32,296
parking is gray, residential is yellow, and then we always place the incentive zoning as a dash line that could be added.

136
00:16:34,163 --> 00:16:41,171
So for Boston Avenue, we have four stories by right, and then two with incentive zoning.

137
00:16:42,272 --> 00:16:55,226
We have some study with the shadows, just to say shadows need a lot more in-depth study, because also the orientation

138
00:16:56,927 --> 00:16:57,708
obviously changes.

139
00:16:57,768 --> 00:17:04,451
So when we have a north-south orientation is very clear and the shadow it is what it is.

140
00:17:04,851 --> 00:17:08,313
But if we have an east and west orientation, that really changes.

141
00:17:09,393 --> 00:17:12,995
So this should be done in a very 3D different model.

142
00:17:13,815 --> 00:17:20,317
Um, we recommend for incentive zoning to accompany those with studies with shadow studies.

143
00:17:21,037 --> 00:17:24,838
Um, so that it benefits also the neighborhood in the surrounding.

144
00:17:25,998 --> 00:17:28,459
Um, it will look at, um.

145
00:17:29,639 --> 00:17:30,519
In section two.

146
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:32,540
That is Johnson Avenue.

147
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:37,181
Um, and play state road crossing the trail tracks.

148
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:52,405
the rail tracks, we see that we can go higher on the rail tracks, so we propose ground floor, then cover parking, and so that we could build on top up to eight stories in total.

149
00:17:54,705 --> 00:17:57,706
Then if we continue on Harvard Avenue,

150
00:17:58,266 --> 00:18:17,232
we have on to the west of Harvard Avenue mixed use to B, so up to eight with incentive zoning, and on the east of Harvard Avenue, we have mixed use A, so four stories plus two.

151
00:18:18,652 --> 00:18:27,235
Really, some of the west parcels are quite big and long, and that gives opportunity to

152
00:18:28,095 --> 00:18:38,604
Um, really develop that area and be a lot more playful with setbacks and, um, with More density.

153
00:18:38,644 --> 00:18:42,407
So part cover parking is more feasible than on the right.

154
00:18:42,547 --> 00:18:43,608
That's why also on the right.

155
00:18:43,769 --> 00:18:47,632
We live it more with, um, to continue with the neighborhood.

156
00:18:48,533 --> 00:18:48,613
Um,

157
00:18:50,820 --> 00:19:02,253
Bower Street, four stories residential, will be on the east of Bower Street and on the west we have four plus two with incentive zoning.

158
00:19:04,275 --> 00:19:10,121
Then High Street, we have four plus two in one side and the

159
00:19:12,744 --> 00:19:22,534
six plus two on the other one, and in here we would need to be a little bit more careful with the shadows because it's north and south orientation.

160
00:19:23,154 --> 00:19:27,518
So that one will be quite permanent in this way.

161
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,221
we need to be careful with that.

162
00:19:32,582 --> 00:19:41,947
These streets are not very wide, so we will need to do a little bit more study on how that sidewalks would look like.

163
00:19:42,588 --> 00:19:51,092
We want them to be as protected and as walkable as possible, so we need to study how much space should we have there.

164
00:19:53,454 --> 00:20:02,380
Canal Street, we have also the rail tracks on the west, Canal Street and how that will fit with the neighborhood.

165
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:16,549
This is the existing parcel right now, residential, so go with the height higher onto the Canal Street and then on the rail tracks push that height towards the rail tracks.

166
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,770
And those are the sections that we have prepared.

167
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:23,371
We can prepare more sections for the next one.

168
00:20:23,511 --> 00:20:26,532
We just want to hear the first comments.

169
00:20:27,132 --> 00:20:30,933
What not only city staff and city council, but also the public.

170
00:20:31,033 --> 00:20:34,494
What are their first thoughts so that we can continue this study?

171
00:20:35,414 --> 00:20:35,954
Thank you very much.

172
00:20:37,964 --> 00:20:38,184
Great.

173
00:20:38,344 --> 00:20:40,865
Thank you so much for that overview, Paola.

174
00:20:40,885 --> 00:20:41,805
I really appreciate it.

175
00:20:41,825 --> 00:20:45,847
So again, it's the first time that we're viewing this proposal.

176
00:20:45,887 --> 00:20:46,727
This is just a draft.

177
00:20:46,747 --> 00:20:48,207
We're not going to be taking any votes tonight.

178
00:20:48,267 --> 00:20:50,308
This is not the last time we're going to be talking about this.

179
00:20:50,368 --> 00:21:00,051
This is just the very first step in this process of iteratively creating the proposal that will then be sent on to the Community Development Board and then back to the City Council.

180
00:21:04,656 --> 00:21:12,520
So having taken that in, first we'll do comments and questions, suggestions and preferences from councillors and city staff.

181
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:18,282
When all that has been pretty well depleted, at the end of the meeting, we will go to all public comment.

182
00:21:20,023 --> 00:21:23,785
I see non-voting member Councillor Lazaro has her hand up.

183
00:21:23,805 --> 00:21:24,845
We'll go to you first.

184
00:21:25,866 --> 00:21:26,366
Please go ahead.

185
00:21:28,132 --> 00:21:29,233
Thank you.

186
00:21:29,573 --> 00:21:31,755
I just have a quick note.

187
00:21:32,475 --> 00:21:35,178
Thank you all for taking this up.

188
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:40,923
Can you mention, please, where the train station is?

189
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:49,069
It's really strangely situated really close to a residential area and yeah, right there.

190
00:21:50,371 --> 00:21:51,732
I'm just curious about

191
00:21:53,417 --> 00:21:55,238
It's like a newly built station.

192
00:21:55,258 --> 00:21:58,260
I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about that.

193
00:21:59,501 --> 00:22:09,167
Also, I think it's really interesting to note that on Canal Street, there are no businesses allowed right now with the current zoning and there are businesses there.

194
00:22:11,848 --> 00:22:17,892
This is just something that we keep seeing with our current zoning that the way that

195
00:22:20,685 --> 00:22:25,327
The way that our zoning is currently written just doesn't allow for the way that our city is built.

196
00:22:25,888 --> 00:22:28,009
So thank you for taking it up.

197
00:22:28,129 --> 00:22:29,650
Thanks for the work you've been doing.

198
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:39,075
Yeah, and if you could just talk a little bit about how we can modernize so that maybe the train station is more integrated into the neighborhood somehow.

199
00:22:39,395 --> 00:22:39,615
Thanks.

200
00:22:41,863 --> 00:22:42,623
Thank you, Councillor.

201
00:22:42,824 --> 00:23:09,240
And yeah, Paula, if you're able to speak to just a little bit, I know there's the train station is already woven into the fabric of West Medford Square, but if you could speak just maybe a little bit to how that factored into the preliminary design of the interplay of mixed use around the train station, where it is in the center of the square, and how we could see that being part of the transition into the residential areas around West Medford Square.

202
00:23:16,657 --> 00:23:30,019
I think Councilor Lazaro was just looking for like a little bit of an explanation around how do you approach integrating the train station into the fabric of the square the surrounding residential area in this updated version of the zoning proposal.

203
00:23:32,107 --> 00:23:48,080
what I see from this original, from this preliminary map, is that it's, you know, mixed use to match with that heavy use that's already there, and then the gradient into mixed use too, and urban residential too, but if you could speak just a little bit to maybe the process there.

204
00:23:48,981 --> 00:24:00,428
One of the things that I was just clarifying also for Paola as she gets into it is that, because she was questioning the description as a train station.

205
00:24:00,548 --> 00:24:02,149
It is a commuter rail stop.

206
00:24:02,229 --> 00:24:09,913
And they have recently just, within the last month or two, opened up a platform that allows it to be an accessible.

207
00:24:10,834 --> 00:24:14,136
But just to clarify that it's not a building, but it is a train.

208
00:24:14,236 --> 00:24:15,537
It is a commuter rail stop.

209
00:24:16,357 --> 00:24:17,718
And one of the things that we found

210
00:24:18,178 --> 00:24:32,583
we've been concerned about is that while that is a rail, and typically people think of that as making things very accessible, our experience is the frequency there is not as frequent as people would like to see.

211
00:24:33,663 --> 00:24:38,765
So it's not anywhere close to having the frequency of even the green line, let alone the orange line.

212
00:24:39,705 --> 00:24:44,347
But it is rail, which makes it a lot more permanent than any of the bus lines that we have.

213
00:24:45,127 --> 00:24:50,389
So I just sort of wanted to clarify that because not everybody's familiar with the West Medford train station.

214
00:24:51,969 --> 00:24:52,309
Thank you.

215
00:24:52,649 --> 00:24:56,571
Yes, I was just a little confused because I just saw that there were platforms.

216
00:24:56,591 --> 00:24:59,972
So I was like, I don't, I haven't seen any building.

217
00:25:01,312 --> 00:25:10,635
I think that it's interesting that for this area, we could ask if that's what the neighborhood want to have an access or to be more clear.

218
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:26,922
and that could be like one of the incentives to have a higher density in the area that there would be at least a clear entrance and a clear space within that area for the platform.

219
00:25:27,362 --> 00:25:39,828
That's something that the people would like we could ask in that area to be more accessible and that the buildings would be more open to that.

220
00:25:40,588 --> 00:25:44,234
So we could include that into the incentive zoning.

221
00:25:46,958 --> 00:25:48,180
I'll go back to Councilor Lozano.

222
00:25:56,219 --> 00:25:56,900
Thanks, sorry.

223
00:25:58,982 --> 00:26:06,069
Yes, the station has always been there, but it didn't even have a platform.

224
00:26:06,129 --> 00:26:08,372
It was just cement on the ground.

225
00:26:09,252 --> 00:26:10,133
Now it's raised.

226
00:26:10,934 --> 00:26:18,242
We've recently had some outreach from the neighbors because there wasn't a lot of communication from the MBTA when it was built.

227
00:26:19,283 --> 00:26:25,887
This is something that I think we need to work on with the MBTA, with everybody who has put the platform there.

228
00:26:26,267 --> 00:26:27,228
They're very bright lights.

229
00:26:27,288 --> 00:26:28,849
There's a lot of loud announcements.

230
00:26:29,249 --> 00:26:35,754
There's no wall in between the platform and where people's houses are.

231
00:26:35,954 --> 00:26:39,476
It's right across the street, and there's nothing that blocks it.

232
00:26:39,576 --> 00:26:41,177
The reason I bring it up is because

233
00:26:42,966 --> 00:26:45,947
You can see it's urban residential too.

234
00:26:46,787 --> 00:26:54,270
It's a ton of single family houses over there and some, you know, I think some three families, some two families, but it's right across the street.

235
00:26:54,530 --> 00:27:11,497
And it's a train station now that's been modernized and is what it probably should have been before, but it's just, it's making announcements and it has bright lights for safety, but also that ends up being like your side yard is now like a bustling,

236
00:27:12,717 --> 00:27:13,878
transit station.

237
00:27:13,978 --> 00:27:36,604
So I think that something that we can consider as part of this discussion is like how to maybe just update the area when we integrate these conversations we can maybe as counselors start thinking about how we talk to our state agencies about like bringing in our our neighbors and making sure that you know those communications are happening.

238
00:27:36,784 --> 00:27:39,105
So that's what I meant by saying that I mean it was like

239
00:27:41,434 --> 00:27:45,639
It's always been a transition it just recently became an accessible one.

240
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:46,460
Thanks.

241
00:27:48,563 --> 00:27:50,545
Thank you counselor will go to President bears.

242
00:27:53,048 --> 00:27:53,409
I think.

243
00:27:54,890 --> 00:28:05,136
One of the things we're talking about and something that's been discussed for a long time is the underutilization of the lots surrounding the immediate platform.

244
00:28:05,757 --> 00:28:18,305
And yes, there has been these accessibility platforms have been added kind of towards the back end of the lot, but they are not a full renovation or the permanent changes that we'd like to see.

245
00:28:19,557 --> 00:28:20,458
at this location.

246
00:28:21,338 --> 00:28:46,296
Another point of note is that, you know, and this is the really big infrastructure question that who knows if and when it will be ever be answered, is that the High Street and Canal Street crossings are two pretty much the only at-grade crossings left, certainly on this part of the lower line all the way up into Woburn.

247
00:28:46,697 --> 00:28:46,917
So

248
00:28:50,153 --> 00:28:54,437
you know, fixing that problem is a much longer question.

249
00:28:54,457 --> 00:29:16,596
Um, in any case, my point being that the zoning of the mix to be for the lots that are currently the parking lot, the old citizens bank, that's now closed the Walgreens and the post office would allow for, I think, and I think any serious project proposal for this area would, um,

250
00:29:18,978 --> 00:29:29,523
look at integrating the into some sort of structure or development.

251
00:29:31,043 --> 00:29:38,346
So that is, I think, a long term vision that has been discussed by many people for a long time for that area.

252
00:29:38,566 --> 00:29:39,847
And I think hopefully

253
00:29:40,928 --> 00:29:53,932
In doing that, we can address some of the issues that have been presented by this kind of temporary, or it's not necessarily temporary, it's permanent, but it's not a complete fix to the accessibility issues for the West Medford commuter rail stop.

254
00:30:00,155 --> 00:30:00,996
Thank you, President Behrs.

255
00:30:02,177 --> 00:30:20,677
And yeah, I think it's generally not the first thing that I think to bring up when we're talking about these new mixed-use sub-districts, but I do think it's very relevant to the discussion, especially in a district like West Medford Square, that a type of sub-district like this and the type of development that allows by right

256
00:30:23,306 --> 00:30:44,444
allows the type of development that is large enough in scale and scope that it could be a partner to the city in the kind of transformational development that we've been wanting to do for a long time and the kind of transformational development that would allow us to cohere some of the neighborhood, just have it integrate better with the railway infrastructure.

257
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:48,127
So to me, that is another

258
00:30:50,192 --> 00:30:56,498
That is another benefit of integrating this mixed use zoning, especially concentrated in the square and along the rail line.

259
00:30:59,898 --> 00:31:00,638
Go ahead, Director Hunt.

260
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:22,031
If I might add on that, so one of the things I was just triple checking to make sure I wasn't misspeaking before saying it, what's really, really interesting here is that the people access this park, this train station from Placestad Road, where there's parking that's just kind of along the road, and I was checking that it's not

261
00:31:24,073 --> 00:31:27,936
really a parcel that's owned by the state.

262
00:31:27,996 --> 00:31:36,462
It's kind of looks like there's the railroad right-of-way and then there's the way parcel and the parking is kind of appears to be on the way parcel.

263
00:31:36,482 --> 00:31:46,470
And then on the other side the parking that's all MBTA parking that you pay the MBTA to use is all privately owned by a company out of California.

264
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:48,771
And I just find that really interesting.

265
00:31:48,831 --> 00:31:53,452
It's the Walgreens building and the entire parking lot is three parcels.

266
00:31:54,152 --> 00:32:08,497
And so one of the things that Hala was pointing out to me is that there is precedent for incentive zoning to a developer to provide access to a public train station, but to develop it.

267
00:32:08,577 --> 00:32:15,219
Because wouldn't it be interesting if there was something taller, more robust there, but we still continue to need

268
00:32:16,179 --> 00:32:20,922
parking for the train station and access.

269
00:32:21,443 --> 00:32:36,012
So if that was, I guess I'm proposing that we put into the incentive zoning for this location specifically public additional height for in exchange for public access to the train station.

270
00:32:38,514 --> 00:32:40,195
Just because we'd like to see that continue.

271
00:32:42,363 --> 00:32:48,947
And it's unclear to me, I've never looked at, like, I have no access to the MBTA lease to know, like, what is their arrangement?

272
00:32:49,007 --> 00:32:49,807
How long is it?

273
00:32:50,167 --> 00:32:51,048
What's going on there?

274
00:32:51,388 --> 00:32:57,992
But it is not owned by the MBTA, according to our assessor's database, or at least we're taxing someone else for it.

275
00:33:01,277 --> 00:33:01,617
Thank you.

276
00:33:01,637 --> 00:33:08,841
I think that could be a really interesting thing for us to look at and for this committee to discuss as we go forward.

277
00:33:08,881 --> 00:33:15,605
We've had some discussion before about tweaking the incentive zoning structure is something that we'll continue to do throughout this process.

278
00:33:15,625 --> 00:33:29,392
I don't think that the incentive zoning table is by any means baked and we have had some discussion about which incentives will apply citywide and which are gonna be tailored to different districts.

279
00:33:31,304 --> 00:33:32,886
So thank you for putting that on the record.

280
00:33:32,906 --> 00:33:33,887
I'm going to make a note of that.

281
00:33:34,107 --> 00:33:35,589
I'm sure our consultants will as well.

282
00:33:42,597 --> 00:33:43,478
All right.

283
00:33:43,678 --> 00:33:47,423
Seeing no other further hands raised from my fellow counselors, I'll just give a

284
00:33:48,834 --> 00:33:51,595
Oh, I'll go back to Councillor Lazar.

285
00:33:52,316 --> 00:33:53,316
Sorry, that was a different hand.

286
00:33:57,138 --> 00:34:01,600
Well, the purpose of this meeting is to get our initial two cents on the record.

287
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:05,762
So I'll just give my my first reaction to

288
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:09,171
our first look at the zoning proposal.

289
00:34:10,312 --> 00:34:12,874
I think that this is a really strong place to be starting in.

290
00:34:13,695 --> 00:34:17,718
I feel really good about this map as the first thing that we look at in this proposal process.

291
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:30,289
Like I mentioned at the beginning of the meeting, I think our goal is with any zoning proposal that's a part of this process is to match existing by right heights or build upon them where it's appropriate.

292
00:34:32,257 --> 00:34:37,024
And this proposal does that, as was shown in the maps in the presentation.

293
00:34:37,905 --> 00:34:43,513
Currently, the zoning for a lot of the center of West Medford Square is already six stories by right.

294
00:34:44,617 --> 00:34:47,219
There's a lot of apartment one, which is three stories by right.

295
00:34:48,820 --> 00:35:09,454
So I think it's really appropriate for us to be looking at this map and considering next use to be kind of as a default for a lot of that commercial center, because I think what I have heard from a lot of constituents so far is they'd like to see increased development potential in West Medford Square.

296
00:35:12,405 --> 00:35:17,406
And given what's already allowed by right, I think that mixed use 2B allows that.

297
00:35:19,747 --> 00:35:37,151
Another thing that pops out to me comparing this proposed draft with the map of the current zoning for West Medford Square is that this is a really cool opportunity for us to create a more thoughtful gradient from the center of West Medford Square into the kind of surrounding neighborhood.

298
00:35:37,951 --> 00:35:39,692
We were looking at the current zoning map earlier,

299
00:35:40,312 --> 00:35:45,593
you know, we have a lot of those six story by right three story by right, and then it's surrounded by a ring of single family.

300
00:35:45,613 --> 00:35:47,373
That's just a really abrupt drop off.

301
00:35:47,453 --> 00:35:48,973
And I think that, um.

302
00:35:49,794 --> 00:35:56,975
We should absolutely consider and present to the public a map more like this one that has that central ring of six stories by right.

303
00:35:57,895 --> 00:36:02,696
Four story by right next used to a where where it makes sense where mixed used to be doesn't make sense.

304
00:36:03,256 --> 00:36:05,896
And then the step down employing you are too.

305
00:36:05,936 --> 00:36:09,377
I think that we should employ you are too pretty intensively around here because of the

306
00:36:10,445 --> 00:36:11,306
commuter rail stop.

307
00:36:13,227 --> 00:36:19,251
Something that we've been trying to prioritize throughout the zoning map is ground floor commercial.

308
00:36:19,271 --> 00:36:25,736
And obviously that's something that people already, you know, I would say both love and miss about West Medford Square.

309
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:33,121
We love the ground floor commercial that's there and we miss the storefronts that we used to be able to patronize that have been vacant for a really long time.

310
00:36:33,161 --> 00:36:34,942
And I think people are really, really eager

311
00:36:36,341 --> 00:36:38,663
to see those storefronts get filled again and mixed use zoning.

312
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:48,634
This is true citywide is like a way for us to allow that by right while also allowing the residential units by right that will support that commercial base.

313
00:36:48,674 --> 00:36:52,558
And that's part of the reason that I think we should be looking at mixed use to be as a default here.

314
00:36:55,258 --> 00:37:16,314
A point that was raised during our ongoing discussion of neighborhood and urban residential is that with the mixed use zoning, being able to add more housing units on upper floors through those increased by right heights has a benefit in that it allows us to free up a little bit more of our green space on those lots potentially.

315
00:37:16,414 --> 00:37:18,115
This is, in some cases, a developer decision.

316
00:37:19,256 --> 00:37:23,980
It allows us to not need to use so much of the footprint of a lot

317
00:37:25,141 --> 00:37:26,083
For adding housing units.

318
00:37:26,123 --> 00:37:37,239
And I think that we are so really It gives us an opportunity to think about how does increased development increased density interplay with protecting green space in West Medford square and with the residential areas surrounding it.

319
00:37:37,259 --> 00:37:37,299
Um,

320
00:37:41,996 --> 00:37:52,402
So I have some specifics in mind where I'd like to see us consider expanding mixed-use 2B, where there's currently mixed-use 2A in this initial draft.

321
00:37:53,083 --> 00:37:54,224
Harbord Ave is one of those.

322
00:37:58,646 --> 00:38:02,168
And just a question about the map itself, actually, Paola, if you don't mind.

323
00:38:02,208 --> 00:38:08,032
There are some lines that are solid black line, and then there's others that are dotted black line.

324
00:38:08,743 --> 00:38:12,948
And then there's other areas on this map that are colored in but outside of the boundary.

325
00:38:13,489 --> 00:38:24,502
Could you explain like what folks are looking at with the solid line dotted line and then I assume that the areas outside of the line are the currently included in the neighborhood and urban residential proposal, but could you clarify that please.

326
00:38:28,757 --> 00:38:34,281
Yes, so there are some, this is the boundary that we consider in the very beginning.

327
00:38:35,742 --> 00:38:40,685
So there are when we have this dash is just to expand that boundary.

328
00:38:42,146 --> 00:38:53,993
And then when we do not have that, because it's breaking that connection, that block, we just continue to understand how that would

329
00:38:56,154 --> 00:38:59,275
how that will transition towards the residential.

330
00:39:00,195 --> 00:39:09,158
So mainly we are wanting to expand in these areas the boundary of the square.

331
00:39:09,879 --> 00:39:12,620
And then here is just to complete this block.

332
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:18,421
And it's not just up to that lot.

333
00:39:19,462 --> 00:39:21,462
We could extend it as well in here.

334
00:39:21,863 --> 00:39:22,803
So it's all completed.

335
00:39:24,164 --> 00:39:32,548
for the Medford Square, but because we are also studying the neighborhoods, it's just to understand how those two will fit, basically.

336
00:39:32,568 --> 00:39:34,609
Great.

337
00:39:34,749 --> 00:39:35,889
Thank you so much for clarifying that.

338
00:39:35,909 --> 00:39:36,630
That's really helpful.

339
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:48,596
And I'll be very curious to hear from community members and my fellow councillors on their thoughts on the proposed extension of the West Medford Square boundary

340
00:39:50,280 --> 00:40:06,954
I know for myself, I'm looking at Harvard Ave and wondering if it makes sense to continue it all the way down Harvard Ave to where it, or it continues all the way down on Harvard Ave on the Northwest side, but not the Southeast side.

341
00:40:06,974 --> 00:40:09,056
Maybe that can be one area to consider.

342
00:40:09,116 --> 00:40:11,958
And I'll be curious for other suggestions.

343
00:40:11,998 --> 00:40:12,879
Yeah, Director Hunt, please.

344
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:17,583
When you say continues down Harvard Ave,

345
00:40:19,088 --> 00:40:20,473
Not all the way down to the river.

346
00:40:20,493 --> 00:40:24,687
Sorry, down to Boston.

347
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:26,470
Right.

348
00:40:27,271 --> 00:40:35,816
So one of the things that I feel like is really helpful for people to understand is that a lot of this purple area is going down the railroad tracks.

349
00:40:35,876 --> 00:40:39,539
And this image helps us a little better than an earlier draft I had seen.

350
00:40:40,399 --> 00:40:47,224
There are actually commercial buildings, industrial buildings, and multifamily all the way down that purple area.

351
00:40:47,584 --> 00:40:51,567
And my brain keeps trying to think that that is Boston Ave.

352
00:40:52,267 --> 00:40:56,592
And because Boston Ave does have commercial further down next to the river.

353
00:40:56,612 --> 00:41:04,781
And so like I think that's something to be thinking about like there's a pocket down there and are we addressing that in our residential zoning.

354
00:41:07,334 --> 00:41:21,708
Honestly, it would help me to see this in the context of our residential zoning but I also see where that's confusing, because we're not talking about the residential, but having the context would be useful, and I apologize for coming up with an idea on the fly.

355
00:41:23,269 --> 00:41:46,867
but I think in the future it might be helpful to look at it like this and then have a second slide that also shows the other currently proposed zoning around it to give people more context so and that we can flip back and forth and say this is what we're talking about but here's the context because some of the and before we like wrap up I do I have received some public comments in email and

356
00:41:47,788 --> 00:42:13,755
like there's in a big picture way there's also the question about going down high street all the way to the river and how are we treating that are we looking at any of that for commercial areas are we going to continue to leave those be non-conforming because there is it's i hesitate to say that high street goes all the way to the river west medford square goes all the way to the river but there are businesses scattered along throughout um

357
00:42:15,635 --> 00:42:17,177
high street all the way out to the river.

358
00:42:17,557 --> 00:42:18,959
And I think we should think about that.

359
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:20,501
I agree.

360
00:42:20,601 --> 00:42:24,725
And I think that this is kind of the right time to be talking about that, because this map is in a very, very early stage.

361
00:42:26,247 --> 00:42:27,068
Go to President Behrs.

362
00:42:27,108 --> 00:42:31,473
And also, I just want to clarify, because I see some hands raised on Zoom, we will get to all public participation.

363
00:42:31,813 --> 00:42:35,377
We'll do that following discussion by committee members.

364
00:42:35,898 --> 00:42:36,679
Go ahead, President Behrs.

365
00:42:38,118 --> 00:42:39,219
Thanks.

366
00:42:39,479 --> 00:42:52,751
I think just looking at this, the Dunkin' Donuts parcel and adjacent parcels, as well as that very large lot that is mostly used for parking that runs on both Harvard and Bauer.

367
00:42:52,771 --> 00:42:59,197
I think, yes, I understand the argument around the tracks being

368
00:43:02,057 --> 00:43:20,203
a place for the mixed-use 2B, but I think we could consider those as well, especially that Duncan lot, which I think could be significantly transformed to be more of an anchor for the square rather than what it is right now, which is mostly an empty parking lot.

369
00:43:22,324 --> 00:43:29,887
In terms of extending down High Street towards the Arlington border, personally, I think

370
00:43:31,355 --> 00:43:39,477
Looking at, I mean, certainly I don't mind considering it in the context of this proposal or as an addendum to this proposal, but I also think that.

371
00:43:40,057 --> 00:43:42,558
Really, when we say there's commercial all the way down to.

372
00:43:43,478 --> 00:43:48,359
The rotary we're talking about 2 commercial buildings and a gas station.

373
00:43:48,379 --> 00:43:55,081
On a couple across 4 or 5 blocks, so it might be more of a candidate for.

374
00:43:55,101 --> 00:43:59,102
The mixed use nodes that we're talking about.

375
00:44:01,018 --> 00:44:03,160
as it could be part of that process.

376
00:44:04,001 --> 00:44:06,444
Um, I just think that the context is a little different.

377
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:13,070
Great.

378
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:13,971
Thank you, President bears.

379
00:44:15,292 --> 00:44:15,713
And, um

380
00:44:17,465 --> 00:44:34,160
It is true that in addition to these kind of more major squares and corridor discussions, we are also going to have a discussion about kind of mixed use nodes that are very intentionally in the fabric of neighborhoods that are smaller in scale ways so that there can be by right

381
00:44:36,375 --> 00:44:45,957
you know, amenities, neighborhood stuff, convenience stores, restaurants, et cetera, in neighborhoods outside of just the major squares to be useful to people.

382
00:44:46,397 --> 00:44:57,200
So that, I think this is a good time to be talking about that and we can continue to discuss if it makes sense as part of this process or if it should be part of the neighborhood nodes process.

383
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,160
I'm gonna go to Planner Evans.

384
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,122
Thank you, madam chair.

385
00:45:05,282 --> 00:45:06,606
I'm Daniel and senior planner.

386
00:45:06,626 --> 00:45:08,911
I was just looking at the map and.

387
00:45:08,931 --> 00:45:13,101
I was thinking that probably the 2 parcels that are.

388
00:45:14,053 --> 00:45:18,655
slated for mixed use 2A behind the St.

389
00:45:18,695 --> 00:45:20,075
Ray's school and the church.

390
00:45:20,616 --> 00:45:22,356
Those are two surface parking lots.

391
00:45:22,396 --> 00:45:31,600
And I was wondering if those should just, and they're also owned by the Archdiocese as well as another two parcels that extend all the way to Boston Ave.

392
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:40,163
And I'm wondering if those two interior surface parcels should have the same zoning as the mixed use 2B to,

393
00:45:44,425 --> 00:45:46,646
have the same zoning at least there.

394
00:45:48,847 --> 00:45:54,129
Sometimes it gets complicated when you have split zoning for the same property owner.

395
00:45:55,850 --> 00:46:01,312
There's also the former convent, which is the preschool, which is, I think that's three stories.

396
00:46:03,273 --> 00:46:11,936
So just thinking like if we're looking at the different ownership and parcels that could potentially be combined and to have them to be the same zone.

397
00:46:13,257 --> 00:46:13,517
Thank you.

398
00:46:17,605 --> 00:46:18,086
Thank you very much.

399
00:46:18,106 --> 00:46:29,465
Okay, so broadly, it sounds like we're talking about.

400
00:46:31,612 --> 00:46:50,624
If we have reactions to specific sub-district assignments in this early draft, and also initial thoughts on where the district boundary makes sense and where we might want to see it extended or earmarked for a future discussion as part of the mixed use neighborhood notes discussion.

401
00:46:53,846 --> 00:47:00,010
And I also, because I forgot to, I do think Director Hunt makes a really good point, especially now that we're

402
00:47:00,502 --> 00:47:07,244
you know, in earlier parts of this process, we didn't have kind of the fully realized neighborhood residential proposal to look at.

403
00:47:07,304 --> 00:47:13,286
Now that we do, I think it would be helpful in future discussions if we could look at those side by side, at least in one slide.

404
00:47:14,226 --> 00:47:18,768
I think it could help us bring up some things that we'd want to discuss.

405
00:47:20,148 --> 00:47:24,490
So just for now, my last two cents on the topic of where we might extend this boundary.

406
00:47:27,615 --> 00:47:31,463
I think I'd I'd put on the record that yeah I would see kind of extent so the.

407
00:47:34,423 --> 00:47:36,084
the side of Harvard Ave closer to the river.

408
00:47:36,104 --> 00:47:41,487
I could see that being made into a parallel line extending the district boundary all the way down to Boston Ave.

409
00:47:43,028 --> 00:47:50,772
And I would want to consider that, just have a discussion about that in the context of the commercial, the restaurants that are on the other side of Boston Ave.

410
00:47:53,394 --> 00:47:55,335
Because I think that could be relevant as well.

411
00:47:55,355 --> 00:47:56,856
I know there's a lot of beloved restaurants right there.

412
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:59,477
And they would kind of, I think they're relevant.

413
00:47:59,717 --> 00:48:02,279
I think that that kind of mini commercial area is relevant.

414
00:48:06,435 --> 00:48:12,317
President Behrs, is that a new hand raised or if it is, feel free to go ahead.

415
00:48:12,337 --> 00:48:14,318
Okay, thank you.

416
00:48:17,319 --> 00:48:27,624
Are there any other comments at this time from councilors or city staff initial reactions to this draft?

417
00:48:29,144 --> 00:48:34,726
Things we wanna get on the record, suggestions, questions for how this draft should evolve.

418
00:48:35,727 --> 00:48:35,907
Next.

419
00:48:46,635 --> 00:48:52,518
All right, hearing none, we can begin with public participation.

420
00:48:52,538 --> 00:48:55,960
Unless there's anything else that city staff want to add.

421
00:48:57,221 --> 00:48:59,562
So we will just give me a second to get set up with my.

422
00:49:01,657 --> 00:49:02,918
Oh, go ahead, Director Hunt.

423
00:49:03,098 --> 00:49:08,181
Sorry, we were just discussing an area that we think we might want to recommend adding.

424
00:49:08,201 --> 00:49:08,281
Okay.

425
00:49:09,402 --> 00:49:21,229
So if you follow Canal Street from High Street and then it crosses the train tracks, the triangle that it makes between Canal Street and the train tracks and the river, what's in there now is a bunch of

426
00:49:21,669 --> 00:49:28,658
is a number of condos and some houses that are probably mostly multifamily.

427
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:34,045
And so the thought was to add that into the red area, the purple area.

428
00:49:34,546 --> 00:49:34,766
Sorry.

429
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:45,887
either Urban Residential 2 or Mixed Use 2B, and Paola will take a look at that to see what, I don't know that it makes sense to put Mixed Use down there.

430
00:49:45,907 --> 00:49:53,293
So one of the things that I'm aware of is that our GPS often takes us on Canal Street there to cross the train tracks.

431
00:49:53,373 --> 00:50:02,259
So I don't know that we'd want to add a commercial there, but we might want to make that an Urban Residential 2 area.

432
00:50:04,257 --> 00:50:05,138
Thank you for flagging that.

433
00:50:05,698 --> 00:50:08,261
Go to President Behrs.

434
00:50:09,682 --> 00:50:10,183
Thank you.

435
00:50:10,203 --> 00:50:12,605
Yeah, I think we need to think about that.

436
00:50:12,625 --> 00:50:20,372
If folks remember the fire on the kind of lower end of

437
00:50:22,063 --> 00:50:26,385
Canal there because it's a dead end because of access issues.

438
00:50:26,525 --> 00:50:34,028
I know that it's just a strange little area in terms of access and developable capacity.

439
00:50:34,068 --> 00:50:35,068
And I think we need to think.

440
00:50:37,890 --> 00:50:46,153
Another step there, and at least review some of the communications that we had with the building department and the fire department around some of their concerns about.

441
00:50:47,812 --> 00:50:58,536
that structure and even just the impact of rebuilding that to its status before the fire and safety and accessibility issues.

442
00:50:58,616 --> 00:51:00,557
I just think it's a kind of a unique question.

443
00:51:00,577 --> 00:51:09,359
I'm not saying we shouldn't do it, but I think we should have that conversation because I know some concerns were raised because of that incident.

444
00:51:13,001 --> 00:51:13,801
Thank you for flagging that.

445
00:51:20,322 --> 00:51:21,743
Oh, is that a hand?

446
00:51:22,124 --> 00:51:22,924
Go ahead, Councilor Lemming.

447
00:51:23,785 --> 00:51:28,829
Sorry, I was used to the green thing coming up, but it just went straight to red, so I'm not sure.

448
00:51:28,889 --> 00:51:29,990
I was also thrown off by that.

449
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:30,430
Go ahead.

450
00:51:30,771 --> 00:51:32,152
I'm not sure what the system is.

451
00:51:33,613 --> 00:51:47,044
No, I just got to note that whole area, not only that triangle, but I think some of the houses along right next to the train tracks on

452
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:52,265
like Tyler Avenue, it's a little bit of a weird area for a bunch of reasons.

453
00:51:52,305 --> 00:52:07,278
I'm thinking like, I mean, this is outside the scope of this, but even trying to make some ways so that that dead end isn't sort of a dead end, but actually like leads across the river, that would be a nice future construction project.

454
00:52:07,298 --> 00:52:13,024
I don't know about the feasibility of that, but I feel like that area would require

455
00:52:14,669 --> 00:52:15,829
particular focus.

456
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:38,153
I know that even the residents along, yeah, I was just kind of thinking about this like weird little corridor along, this weird little street on Tyler Avenue because I know the residents there have like a lot of issues with train noise as well.

457
00:52:38,213 --> 00:52:41,314
So I was trying to think of ways to like maybe

458
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:50,586
do something with like sound barriers, but I don't think that's like that just came up a lot, but I'm not 100% sure if that's something we could really solve with zoning.

459
00:52:50,626 --> 00:52:57,690
But yeah, I do feel like just walking around this driving around this area tends to be a very strange experience.

460
00:52:57,730 --> 00:53:01,673
So any additional focus on it would be welcome.

461
00:53:06,236 --> 00:53:07,757
Great, thank you for that Councilor Lemming.

462
00:53:10,684 --> 00:53:15,669
Any additional notes at this time by city staff or committee members?

463
00:53:16,891 --> 00:53:17,251
Seeing none.

464
00:53:18,032 --> 00:53:26,658
All right, great, well, I know there are a lot of people here to give their thoughts on this preliminary proposal, so we'll go to public participation.

465
00:53:26,678 --> 00:53:33,843
We will switch between podium and Zoom, though the people on Zoom vastly outnumber the people in the council chambers.

466
00:53:34,664 --> 00:53:45,612
Every participant will have three minutes to speak, and I'll endeavor to remember to alert people when they are coming up on 30 seconds left.

467
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:50,402
So if you're in the chambers, feel free to just line up.

468
00:53:51,062 --> 00:53:53,706
Go first to Emily on Zoom.

469
00:53:54,226 --> 00:53:58,031
Please give your name and address for the record and I'll start the timer for three minutes.

470
00:53:58,291 --> 00:53:59,192
Just asked you to unmute.

471
00:54:00,454 --> 00:54:00,694
Sure.

472
00:54:00,794 --> 00:54:03,457
Emily Prada from 19 Johnson Ave.

473
00:54:05,279 --> 00:54:05,580
Go ahead.

474
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:05,840
Thank you.

475
00:54:06,723 --> 00:54:07,804
Sure.

476
00:54:07,964 --> 00:54:31,585
Yeah, I just wanted to make sure that like, you know, keeping the train station in West Redford really is vital to the area, but also making sure as that area gets developed, that public access to that platform is maintained, even if, you know, residences are sort of built up around their commercial property, so that there are public access ways from all directions, because having people, you know, have to reroute and

477
00:54:32,133 --> 00:54:37,756
go around could actually be deterrence to taking the public transportation for the commuter rail.

478
00:54:37,776 --> 00:54:47,761
I think also making sure you maintain parking lots because, you know, people drive there from, you know, a mile or two miles away from within Medford as well.

479
00:54:48,662 --> 00:54:54,785
So making sure that's maintained with any sort of rezoning as well.

480
00:54:55,791 --> 00:55:14,375
Um, I'd also be really interested in the overlays that you said, um, those two concentric, um, the white spaces for those two concentric, um, circles in the gray to really sort of understand, like, is it residential beyond there or is it, uh, other mixed uses, uh, zoning that you guys are talking about?

481
00:55:15,216 --> 00:55:20,297
Um, as well, I think that would really help sort of the context of it, um, to be able to understand.

482
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:25,378
I'm kind of curious in that first sort of circle, is that meant to be?

483
00:55:26,018 --> 00:55:28,340
other mixed use areas or is that residential?

484
00:55:31,382 --> 00:55:34,484
Great, thank you and please feel free if you have more questions, feel free to say them all at the same time.

485
00:55:34,544 --> 00:55:37,286
We can get to your questions at the end of your three minutes.

486
00:55:37,867 --> 00:55:38,487
Nope, that's all.

487
00:55:39,397 --> 00:55:40,137
Okay, great.

488
00:55:40,157 --> 00:55:40,757
Thank you so much.

489
00:55:42,978 --> 00:55:43,598
Great question.

490
00:55:43,718 --> 00:55:56,222
So the two circles and just saying this for anybody who doesn't know it already, the inner one is a the quarter mile radius from the train stop and the outer circle is the half mile radius from the train stop.

491
00:55:56,922 --> 00:56:05,145
And I believe that everything not included in the squares proposal, everything that's not colored in would be encompassed by our neighborhood and urban

492
00:56:05,894 --> 00:56:07,675
PB, Lisa Smith-Miyazaki, she-her-hers, she-her-hers.

493
00:56:29,391 --> 00:56:33,334
Yeah, so you're exactly right.

494
00:56:34,515 --> 00:56:44,783
We will look into what are the existing commercial uses and where are they, so that if we need to extend some of these mixed uses or create some

495
00:56:45,884 --> 00:56:53,954
more local kind of corridors or maybe include them in the commercial nodes that we will discuss later on.

496
00:56:54,895 --> 00:57:00,542
So to see if there are any clusters in certain areas and how to make those conforming.

497
00:57:01,863 --> 00:57:05,588
So we will be looking into the existing and see how we can integrate those.

498
00:57:10,232 --> 00:57:14,316
Great, thank you so much, Paola, and thank you, Emily, for your comments.

499
00:57:15,597 --> 00:57:16,438
Go next to the podium.

500
00:57:16,918 --> 00:57:17,939
Name and address for the record, please.

501
00:57:17,979 --> 00:57:18,500
You have three minutes.

502
00:57:22,224 --> 00:57:22,684
Oh, sorry.

503
00:57:24,065 --> 00:57:24,366
There you go.

504
00:57:26,107 --> 00:57:28,590
Hello, William Devar, 108 Bedford Street, Apartment 1B.

505
00:57:28,610 --> 00:57:30,852
Basically, I support the proposal.

506
00:57:30,892 --> 00:57:34,055
I'm glad we're seeing more density proposed than what we saw previously.

507
00:57:34,835 --> 00:57:40,979
it's important that housing go up in the area to address the regional housing crisis, but also to support the desired business district.

508
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:49,725
I agree, a little more 2B would be good, especially, again, along the second side of Harvard Street that was left out.

509
00:57:50,986 --> 00:57:59,971
And I sort of agree with the idea of having sort of a corridor-type situation going, extending towards the river along High Street.

510
00:58:01,092 --> 00:58:02,173
And the reason for that,

511
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:12,084
is because when we heard we were losing the number 80 bus, one of the things that kept coming up was that West Bedford values its connection to Arlington Center.

512
00:58:12,524 --> 00:58:16,046
And I went, whoa, I didn't realize those were near each other hardly.

513
00:58:16,566 --> 00:58:17,206
Well, they are.

514
00:58:18,167 --> 00:58:28,791
It's 0.8 miles from Grove Street intersection to the Catholic church that marks when you know you've arrived at Arlington Center, only 0.8 miles.

515
00:58:30,492 --> 00:58:33,636
yet the design language etc doesn't tell you that.

516
00:58:34,116 --> 00:58:49,514
If there was a mixed-use corridor going down beyond just little nodes where there's already businesses in a corridor, that would tell you, you know, you follow this way, you remain in an urban area, you're not walking out to the suburbs and exurbs, you're walking to quite a nice urban area at Arlington Centre.

517
00:58:49,935 --> 00:58:50,896
So I think almost for like

518
00:58:51,313 --> 00:58:52,535
for like that kind of reason.

519
00:58:52,995 --> 00:59:00,965
And because you're along that nice 80 bus that we were so afraid to lose through the better bus reform, reformat, whatever it's called.

520
00:59:02,693 --> 00:59:04,153
We're gonna get screwed out of the 80 bus.

521
00:59:04,834 --> 00:59:08,955
We love the 80 bus, we should be having lots of stuff along it.

522
00:59:09,235 --> 00:59:23,220
And yeah, that to be, indeed, should be the sort of the baseline for this area, because we need lots of housing, and so on in order to make sure that the commercial district works as enough customers.

523
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:24,120
Thank you.

524
00:59:29,802 --> 00:59:30,362
Thank you, William.

525
00:59:34,072 --> 00:59:36,453
All right, we'll go back to Zoom.

526
00:59:38,214 --> 00:59:39,714
We'll go to Jennifer Yanko.

527
00:59:39,734 --> 00:59:40,935
I'll ask you to unmute.

528
00:59:40,975 --> 00:59:42,315
Name and address for the record, please.

529
00:59:43,376 --> 00:59:44,256
And you have three minutes.

530
00:59:48,818 --> 00:59:49,438
Go ahead, Jennifer.

531
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:55,100
Oh, we can hear you now.

532
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:56,021
Go ahead.

533
00:59:56,061 --> 00:59:57,101
Name and address for the record, please.

534
00:59:57,641 --> 01:00:00,382
It's not allowing me to put my video on, but maybe that's OK.

535
01:00:00,402 --> 01:00:02,223
That's all right.

536
01:00:04,141 --> 01:00:12,885
I want to echo this concern that Emily expressed about, it's hard to grasp what we're dealing with for two reasons.

537
01:00:13,325 --> 01:00:22,269
One is that we don't really know what the zoning is in these circles, the inner, the quarter mile and the half mile.

538
01:00:22,669 --> 01:00:29,032
It would be helpful to know because they're contiguous with some of the proposed areas.

539
01:00:32,809 --> 01:00:47,580
And also, we don't really have an image of where the businesses are, the commercial establishments that are apparently, if I understand correctly, out of,

540
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:55,303
out of zoning, they're not complying with the zoning.

541
01:00:55,644 --> 01:01:04,151
But because we do have various commercial establishments in areas that appear to be zoned as residential.

542
01:01:04,551 --> 01:01:08,575
So anyway, it makes it harder for the layperson to understand that.

543
01:01:11,517 --> 01:01:17,943
That said, I would support the idea of extending this sort of corridor down High Street

544
01:01:18,376 --> 01:01:23,542
I mean, we already have a few businesses on High Street as we go towards the river.

545
01:01:23,562 --> 01:01:40,440
I think that would be important to make that mixed use of some sort, which would allow us to have a bit more choice as that area is developed.

546
01:01:42,185 --> 01:02:07,878
And the last thing that I wanted to say is, and this may be slightly different, there are a lot of people in this neighborhood, I'm one of them, and in many neighborhoods throughout Medford and other cities, who have multifamily homes that could be, if the zoning allowed, could be made into more units.

547
01:02:09,122 --> 01:02:11,624
But the current zoning does not allow that.

548
01:02:12,865 --> 01:02:19,049
And that is really working against creating more housing.

549
01:02:20,650 --> 01:02:22,251
So those are my comments.

550
01:02:22,712 --> 01:02:24,573
And thank you for all this work.

551
01:02:24,693 --> 01:02:31,378
I really do support rezoning the area and the proposal that you have made.

552
01:02:32,799 --> 01:02:35,881
As I said, I would like to see it even expanded further.

553
01:02:36,882 --> 01:02:37,202
Thank you.

554
01:02:41,809 --> 01:02:45,551
Great, thank you so much, Jennifer, for your comments.

555
01:02:46,891 --> 01:03:07,200
And I just wanted to highlight, we will work on getting a version of the updated proposal superimposed on what we did for Neighborhood and Urban Residential when we were further along in the process as we superimposed the proposal on top of the current zoning and on top of, yeah, on top of the current zoning.

556
01:03:08,621 --> 01:03:18,232
I'm sure that we can do that for this proposal superimpose it on top of the current zoning, and also situated within the context of the neighborhood and urban residential zoning which will surround it.

557
01:03:18,252 --> 01:03:20,174
I think that'll be helpful for folks.

558
01:03:20,395 --> 01:03:23,078
In the meantime, President Bares did pop into the chat.

559
01:03:24,279 --> 01:03:31,504
the section of the City Council's public portal where you can see the proposals for the neighborhood and urban residential zoning.

560
01:03:32,545 --> 01:03:34,946
So everybody, please do check that out.

561
01:03:35,266 --> 01:03:42,412
And hopefully that will give everybody a good start on absorbing some more of that context.

562
01:03:42,492 --> 01:03:46,214
And then I think we can, I'm sure we can follow up with super superimposed imagery.

563
01:03:46,695 --> 01:03:47,195
Go ahead, Paola.

564
01:03:49,895 --> 01:03:51,716
I'm just to remind.

565
01:03:52,156 --> 01:03:53,737
Um, thank you, Jennifer.

566
01:03:53,777 --> 01:03:55,198
Those are great comments.

567
01:03:55,898 --> 01:03:58,640
Um, we proposed for these areas.

568
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:04,123
Um, I believe it was neighborhood residential three, which allows up to three units.

569
01:04:05,063 --> 01:04:16,810
Um, in the big majority of this area because we received quite a lot of comments during the public meeting and any of the public hearings that we had.

570
01:04:18,171 --> 01:04:19,432
we are reviewing that.

571
01:04:20,052 --> 01:04:25,357
And that's why right now we didn't place any of those under because we are reviewing those.

572
01:04:25,417 --> 01:04:30,100
So we will be showing a previous version that we are thinking already in changing.

573
01:04:31,542 --> 01:04:42,530
So the next time we will bring all these reviewed areas with the residential, probably with higher density that you would see in the present proposal.

574
01:04:43,411 --> 01:04:45,693
So I just wanted to point that.

575
01:04:48,304 --> 01:04:48,504
Great.

576
01:04:49,425 --> 01:04:50,246
Thank you so much, Paola.

577
01:04:51,727 --> 01:05:00,835
And just while we're talking about the other materials on neighborhood and urban residential that are available right now, there's the link in the chat that President Behrs dropped.

578
01:05:00,915 --> 01:05:11,344
And then if anybody looks that up and fails to bookmark it and wants to see it again, if you go to medfordma.org slash zoning, those same diagrams are available there.

579
01:05:13,279 --> 01:05:15,961
All right, we'll go to the podium.

580
01:05:16,421 --> 01:05:17,301
Yes, we'll go back to the podium.

581
01:05:17,321 --> 01:05:19,062
Name and address for the record, please.

582
01:05:20,043 --> 01:05:21,624
And you will have three minutes.

583
01:05:22,444 --> 01:05:24,886
Hi, Sam Goldstein, 29 Martin Street.

584
01:05:26,067 --> 01:05:32,210
Want to just voice my general support for this proposal and excitement around it.

585
01:05:33,111 --> 01:05:33,351
I think

586
01:05:33,802 --> 01:05:41,106
my feedback is probably similar to a lot of feedback from others tonight around this.

587
01:05:41,186 --> 01:05:48,470
You know, in particular, you know, I'd like to see, you know, good density in the area.

588
01:05:48,710 --> 01:05:58,515
And, you know, as others have sort of noted, I kind of wonder about, you know, what the areas along kind of the busiest roads leading into

589
01:05:59,583 --> 01:06:13,754
Um, the area would look like, uh, you know, I support, uh, you know, more density and potentially, um, you know, commercial use along High Street heading towards Arlington Center.

590
01:06:14,135 --> 01:06:18,078
In particular, you know, I think the southern side of that road right now does have a pretty

591
01:06:18,698 --> 01:06:21,679
good, you know, number of storefronts along it.

592
01:06:21,779 --> 01:06:29,140
It would be nice to see, you know, maybe some of that developed into, you know, maybe some more robust, you know, mixed use.

593
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:46,343
Likewise, you know, I know not immediately, at least off the top of my head, clear like what Boston Ave will end up looking like under the proposal, but I think Boston Ave also, you know, has some

594
01:06:47,428 --> 01:06:51,009
capacity for more density and mixed use potentially.

595
01:06:51,029 --> 01:07:10,714
And I'm kind of curious what the portion of a playstead road leading out of the square might look like, if there might be some more height there or what.

596
01:07:11,434 --> 01:07:15,955
But yeah, generally excited about this, looking forward to seeing how the city grows.

597
01:07:16,035 --> 01:07:16,255
Thank you.

598
01:07:17,898 --> 01:07:18,439
Thank you very much.

599
01:07:25,485 --> 01:07:28,688
All right, we will go next to Gaston.

600
01:07:29,489 --> 01:07:30,770
Name and address for the record, please.

601
01:07:31,451 --> 01:07:32,292
You have three minutes.

602
01:07:33,426 --> 01:07:36,128
Thank you.

603
01:07:36,648 --> 01:07:39,710
I just wanted to say some comments.

604
01:07:39,891 --> 01:07:48,336
So the first one is that the triangle that Dr. Hunt mentioned, I think that would be great to develop it a little bit more.

605
01:07:49,417 --> 01:08:05,560
Also, I was thinking that still West Medford Square seems slightly undeveloped compared to some of the, for example, Medford Square next to the highway allows up to 12 stories high.

606
01:08:06,220 --> 01:08:10,241
Here we go only up to eight, and even considering with respect to Salem.

607
01:08:10,661 --> 01:08:13,802
So Salem with the amendment that Matt Deming proposed and got voted in,

608
01:08:14,883 --> 01:08:18,746
It actually has mixes two up to six with incentive zoning.

609
01:08:19,207 --> 01:08:22,450
And then here, we're only going up to eight with incentive zoning.

610
01:08:22,890 --> 01:08:24,311
So there's not that much difference.

611
01:08:24,772 --> 01:08:36,943
However, Medford Square has a humongous difference with everything else, which is that it has a West Medford Commuter Rail Station, which is one station away from North Station, which is in the heart of Boston.

612
01:08:37,443 --> 01:08:39,345
And that's around only 10 minutes.

613
01:08:40,015 --> 01:08:40,815
by the commuter rail.

614
01:08:40,875 --> 01:08:47,376
So to me, it looks like we still need to develop this area more, maybe even with mixed use three.

615
01:08:47,517 --> 01:08:52,918
So going up to 12 stories, if the terrain allows, because of the commuter rail.

616
01:08:53,298 --> 01:08:54,638
The commuter rail here is key.

617
01:08:54,718 --> 01:09:09,401
And then also within, so if we look at the quarter mile radius, so that drops into, I have actually the zoning here into neighborhood residential three, and I see no urban residential one.

618
01:09:10,061 --> 01:09:18,307
We didn't, in particular, we look at place that going sort of Northwest and maybe potential a little bit more Northeast.

619
01:09:18,767 --> 01:09:26,192
I think it would be nice, definitely within the quarter mile radius, nothing beyond that, to use some urban residential one.

620
01:09:27,353 --> 01:09:32,956
I think that would also help to sort of make the transition down to neighborhood residential three.

621
01:09:33,176 --> 01:09:38,180
And so remember the urban residential one would allow the multiplex, so four to six units,

622
01:09:38,850 --> 01:09:41,051
which neighborhood residential three does not.

623
01:09:41,091 --> 01:09:48,633
So again, comparing, for example, with the green line station, there we have urban residential one.

624
01:09:48,813 --> 01:09:58,256
And then as we have heard from the residents over there, there's plenty of single family homes there, which would become non-compliant.

625
01:09:58,316 --> 01:10:04,798
So I think to make it more fair, the urban residential one in some areas on here would make sense.

626
01:10:07,183 --> 01:10:09,485
And other than that, it looks good.

627
01:10:09,525 --> 01:10:12,126
So I think it was a huge improvement from last meeting.

628
01:10:12,186 --> 01:10:14,868
So I thank everyone that made this possible.

629
01:10:15,208 --> 01:10:28,836
But again, I think because we had the commuter rail station, which is one station away from the heart of Boston, I think we need to sort of increase this density as much as we can.

630
01:10:28,936 --> 01:10:29,496
Thank you so much.

631
01:10:32,958 --> 01:10:34,459
Thank you very much, Gaston.

632
01:10:34,479 --> 01:10:36,120
We will make sure to consider your comments.

633
01:10:40,536 --> 01:10:40,716
Great.

634
01:10:40,876 --> 01:10:43,518
Go next to Harrison on Zoom.

635
01:10:44,519 --> 01:10:45,780
Name and address for the record, please.

636
01:10:45,820 --> 01:10:46,501
You'll have three minutes.

637
01:10:51,985 --> 01:10:52,626
Hello.

638
01:10:52,726 --> 01:10:59,491
Harrison Green to Ronaleigh Road in the vicinity of West Medford Square, a little bit north.

639
01:10:59,951 --> 01:11:04,035
So I am in support of this zoning.

640
01:11:04,115 --> 01:11:07,657
I'm in support of an expansion of the perimeter as well.

641
01:11:08,963 --> 01:11:23,550
And while I see West Medford Square being like the focal point of the square being the commuter rail station, I also see it being a bus hub and a bus transit opportunity.

642
01:11:23,730 --> 01:11:27,252
So inevitably, when this conversation becomes about parking,

643
01:11:27,829 --> 01:11:39,359
as we add more units around, I think that we should be focused on where the bus lines are now and where they are going to be, which is down High Street more and to Boston Ave.

644
01:11:39,499 --> 01:11:53,970
I see the westernmost part of this map being, I would imagine that should be as large a node as, or close to as large a node as the intersection of Playstead and High Street, so.

645
01:11:55,071 --> 01:12:12,578
Additionally, I think the border should extend past just Boston Ave and go into the next block so that all of Boston Ave can be developed as higher density instead of kind of single family on one side and then multifamily on the other.

646
01:12:13,699 --> 01:12:14,919
Thank you for putting this together.

647
01:12:14,939 --> 01:12:17,180
It's really getting there and looking great.

648
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:18,761
Thanks for the work you've done.

649
01:12:21,442 --> 01:12:21,662
Great.

650
01:12:21,702 --> 01:12:24,163
Thank you so much for the comments and suggestions, Harrison.

651
01:12:28,269 --> 01:12:31,939
Go next to Marilyn on Zoom.

652
01:12:32,099 --> 01:12:33,483
Name and address for the record, please.

653
01:12:33,523 --> 01:12:34,245
You'll have three minutes.

654
01:12:41,543 --> 01:12:46,987
All right, I'm going to click the ask to unmute Marilyn, you should see a button appear on your side.

655
01:12:47,007 --> 01:12:49,648
Oh, there you go.

656
01:12:50,009 --> 01:12:52,470
Marilyn Davidson at 80 Harvard Avenue.

657
01:12:53,791 --> 01:12:56,053
I'd love, I'd love to see more density.

658
01:12:56,613 --> 01:13:00,015
I'd also like to see more commercial use.

659
01:13:02,363 --> 01:13:16,017
Two things, when you start building really tall buildings along a narrow street like High Street, you're going to end up with a canyon, which might not be all that attractive.

660
01:13:18,319 --> 01:13:25,286
So I would be in favor of the density as a sort of setback kind of thing.

661
01:13:28,384 --> 01:13:38,750
maybe putting the first floor on the street and having a setback for the upper stories, which is done in other cities.

662
01:13:39,910 --> 01:13:49,576
Number two, the congestion around High Street because of the commuter rail crossing can be really amazing.

663
01:13:50,736 --> 01:13:55,319
So adding a lot of density, you have to figure out how you're going to handle the traffic.

664
01:13:56,995 --> 01:13:58,836
So those are my two points.

665
01:14:02,299 --> 01:14:02,519
Great.

666
01:14:02,759 --> 01:14:04,020
Thank you so much for your comments, Marilyn.

667
01:14:10,304 --> 01:14:11,765
All right, go next to Caitlin.

668
01:14:11,785 --> 01:14:13,826
Name and address for the record, please.

669
01:14:13,906 --> 01:14:14,547
You have three minutes.

670
01:14:18,149 --> 01:14:25,154
Hi, my name is Caitlin Robinson, 31 Everett Street, and I just want to voice my general support for this proposal.

671
01:14:25,658 --> 01:14:37,322
I do agree with previous commenters who have talked about trying to increase the density, expand the perimeter, as well as creating more of a corridor toward Arlington Center.

672
01:14:38,302 --> 01:14:51,667
I also want to, and I know that this is going to be a separate thing, but again, express my concern about parking minimums and how if we retain the parking minimums, that it might work against some of the goals of this.

673
01:14:51,727 --> 01:14:53,968
So I hope that we will look at eliminating those.

674
01:14:54,348 --> 01:14:54,648
Thank you.

675
01:14:56,817 --> 01:14:58,078
Thank you so much for your comments, Caitlin.

676
01:14:58,098 --> 01:15:04,982
All right, going next to Judith.

677
01:15:05,743 --> 01:15:07,344
Name and address for the record, please.

678
01:15:07,364 --> 01:15:08,885
You have three minutes.

679
01:15:09,865 --> 01:15:12,307
Hi, it's Judith Weinstock at 144 Burgett.

680
01:15:12,387 --> 01:15:14,568
I don't live in this zone, as you all know.

681
01:15:15,169 --> 01:15:19,432
But I also, the gal right before me, I could imagine

682
01:15:20,538 --> 01:15:43,396
if all the commercial work is done along High Street and ultimately the parcels that are currently parking lots are not owned by or leased by the MBTA and they're owned by a private person, that the parking for the commuter rail stop, I would think, would be really compromised in those areas.

683
01:15:44,737 --> 01:16:01,362
I don't take the commuter rail, but I would think that as you build and build and build up, you know, if it's going to become a drop off station, like, some of the T stops are that's 1 thing, but I would think that those lots that are currently used for parking are in jeopardy as this program grows.

684
01:16:02,262 --> 01:16:15,330
Um, mostly because those commercial areas will want parking for their commercial, um, retails, retail shops, but also because the owner of those, of that lot will know that it's worth a small fortune.

685
01:16:15,730 --> 01:16:16,570
So that's all.

686
01:16:17,031 --> 01:16:17,771
Thank you again.

687
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:20,633
Great.

688
01:16:20,933 --> 01:16:22,194
Thank you so much for your comments, Judith.

689
01:16:22,394 --> 01:16:22,994
Really appreciate it.

690
01:16:24,195 --> 01:16:24,295
Um,

691
01:16:27,195 --> 01:16:40,399
Something that was discussed in brief when we were looking at the section studies just earlier, and we kind of spent a little more time talking about this in the context of West, sorry in the context of Medford Square actually something that we'll revisit.

692
01:16:40,959 --> 01:16:48,981
I'm sure both with Medford Square and West Medford Square are opportunities with the mixed use zoning for covered parking.

693
01:16:51,622 --> 01:17:14,545
Obviously, I hope it goes without saying, but it shouldn't that, you know, certainly in West Medford squares and elsewhere, we're conscious that we really need to prioritize land area for uses for residential for commercial, but we're not unaware of the need for parking, both for the active business area and for the commercial and for the commuter rail.

694
01:17:15,986 --> 01:17:29,400
And Paula and Emily from the associates team so far I've done a really great job of presenting some I think novel and very compelling ways that we could integrate parking into the fabric of some of these mixed use developments so that it doesn't.

695
01:17:31,884 --> 01:17:43,467
doesn't necessarily monopolize some of the area that could be put to productive use and developments, but does retain some parking in and around the square for those who will continue to need it.

696
01:17:44,267 --> 01:17:47,748
I see that Paula has put up one of those slides on the screen.

697
01:17:47,768 --> 01:17:57,391
Do you want to speak to that just briefly, just kind of an overview of what some of these mixed uses enable in terms of covered parking, just for context?

698
01:18:00,068 --> 01:18:03,109
Yes, so these are proposals that when we.

699
01:18:04,469 --> 01:18:12,632
This is not what we proposed to be exactly, but we always showed or tried to show some of the possibilities that could happen in this area.

700
01:18:14,692 --> 01:18:21,895
We always think that if we allow more density, then having cover parking starts to be feasible.

701
01:18:22,935 --> 01:18:26,236
What we can also introduce is whenever we have

702
01:18:28,457 --> 01:18:32,899
public that we could also have public parking as an incentive.

703
01:18:33,460 --> 01:18:43,245
And so in these areas of mixed use that they could reach another story, they provide a certain amount of parking that can be for the public.

704
01:18:44,065 --> 01:18:47,747
Some of the of the ones that are near the train station that could be

705
01:18:48,227 --> 01:18:53,772
For people using the commuter rail or for people using the commercial areas.

706
01:18:54,874 --> 01:19:04,803
Also, the idea is to make these more walkable in that sense that if we densify and have more residential in this quarter mile and half a mile.

707
01:19:05,323 --> 01:19:23,761
a lot of the people would go walking to the commercial area, so people would use less the car, since right now it's quite low density in the area, because we have general residential that it meets only two units, and then single family districts.

708
01:19:24,602 --> 01:19:27,785
We are now converting that into at least multi-family.

709
01:19:29,118 --> 01:19:36,083
So the idea is that we would have a lot more residential to use these businesses, and that is people walking towards the commercial.

710
01:19:36,103 --> 01:19:39,866
So try to look from those points of view.

711
01:19:48,332 --> 01:19:50,293
Great, thank you so much for that overview.

712
01:19:50,333 --> 01:19:53,835
We'll certainly, we can revisit that topic and those possibilities.

713
01:19:55,736 --> 01:19:58,078
I'm sure that we will in future discussions.

714
01:19:59,258 --> 01:19:59,919
Great, thank you.

715
01:20:00,239 --> 01:20:01,480
I see no further hands raised.

716
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:08,444
So there are just a few emailed comments that I'm going to read into the record.

717
01:20:11,285 --> 01:20:15,931
This one is from Dave McKenna to Vine Street who requested this read aloud.

718
01:20:17,773 --> 01:20:23,320
Dave says, I am very supportive of the changes that have been made to allow more development in West Medford Square.

719
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:25,923
However, I would like to make a few additional suggestions.

720
01:20:26,845 --> 01:20:29,348
You are too should be allowed to go to four stories.

721
01:20:30,860 --> 01:20:39,285
The area under consideration could be expanded one more block to the west with mixed use one, which is three stories by right, plus one story with incentive zoning.

722
01:20:40,226 --> 01:20:46,390
On the south side of High Street at the west end of this plan, there is already mixed use one block beyond the limit of this plan.

723
01:20:47,370 --> 01:20:57,937
On the north side, this is within a stone's throw from the commuter station, and I believe MX1 would be appropriate additional density while stepping down from the center of the square towards the residential neighborhood.

724
01:20:59,649 --> 01:21:07,818
The area under consideration could also be expanded to the east one to two blocks with MX1 to step down away from the center of the square and expand the corridor.

725
01:21:07,838 --> 01:21:17,989
I think the MX1 doesn't have to require ground floor commercial, it could be left optional so that based on the evolving needs of the area, it could be residential or mixed use.

726
01:21:20,972 --> 01:21:21,673
That was Dave's comment.

727
01:21:23,335 --> 01:21:34,546
There are a couple others that indicated they wanted to submit comments tonight, but they didn't specifically say they wanted their comments read into the record, so I will read them but not use names, just in case the commenter would not have preferred that.

728
01:21:35,847 --> 01:21:36,248
One says,

729
01:21:39,173 --> 01:21:41,756
Since I can't attend the committee meeting tonight, I'm submitting this.

730
01:21:42,496 --> 01:21:53,868
While I applaud the citywide zoning effort all around, I would like to see the proposal for West Medford go further to increase density in the proposed district and to expand the boundaries of the mixed use and urban residential district.

731
01:21:55,505 --> 01:22:05,609
In particular, I would like to see all of High Street from the Brooks School down to the Rotary by the river, as well as Boston Ave from High Street to the river, be some combination of mixed use and urban residential.

732
01:22:06,329 --> 01:22:14,132
This would be reflective of the land uses that are there now and create more opportunities to expand housing in an area that has good transit service.

733
01:22:18,814 --> 01:22:20,215
And the final one in my inbox.

734
01:22:22,373 --> 01:22:27,420
simply reads, any chance the business on Harvard Ave could change to mixed-use 2B?

735
01:22:29,102 --> 01:22:30,243
Currently, it's mixed-use 2A.

736
01:22:36,451 --> 01:22:36,932
Go ahead, Paola.

737
01:22:39,645 --> 01:22:51,028
Just to mention about Harvard Avenue, there are, we have the fire department and Dunkin Donuts and between those two lots that are two very beautiful historic buildings.

738
01:22:52,268 --> 01:22:55,889
So that is why that side is a little bit lower.

739
01:22:56,009 --> 01:22:58,750
Also, we have then the connection with the neighborhood.

740
01:23:00,151 --> 01:23:03,613
We can study to see if we can go higher.

741
01:23:04,954 --> 01:23:06,755
But the idea was to protect those.

742
01:23:06,875 --> 01:23:09,577
Also, those lots are a lot smaller.

743
01:23:09,597 --> 01:23:20,384
So that was the process behind leaving that a little bit lower to A instead of to B. But we can absolutely look at it.

744
01:23:23,006 --> 01:23:23,246
Great.

745
01:23:23,507 --> 01:23:23,987
Thank you, Paola.

746
01:23:28,152 --> 01:23:34,618
All right, well, we've gotten a lot of reactions and suggestions on the record this evening.

747
01:23:34,658 --> 01:23:35,439
I think that's great.

748
01:23:36,319 --> 01:23:41,524
I feel like there's a general coherent interest in

749
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:47,361
continuing the conversation around where these boundaries make sense and where we'd like to see them extended.

750
01:23:48,061 --> 01:23:54,903
And we've gotten a lot of suggestions for where certain sub districts could be tweaked to go from 2A to 2B, from 2B to 3.

751
01:23:56,363 --> 01:24:05,165
And a lot of interest in the next time we look at this, considering it side by side with the context of the residential areas surrounding which will also help us continue the discussion of

752
01:24:05,925 --> 01:24:14,385
where this district boundary should end and where we should be making that shift from mixed use to residential and how dense that residential should be.

753
01:24:17,627 --> 01:24:18,167
So this is great.

754
01:24:18,487 --> 01:24:18,907
I'm excited.

755
01:24:18,947 --> 01:24:20,908
Thank you all so much for a very substantive discussion.

756
01:24:22,528 --> 01:24:32,030
Lots for NS associates and city staff and myself to take back and make sure it is considered and incorporated into the next version of this proposal.

757
01:24:33,250 --> 01:24:41,171
So since I don't see any additional hands raised from members of the public or committee members, I'll just give a quick overview of next steps.

758
01:24:42,571 --> 01:24:45,472
We will meet in committee about this proposal again.

759
01:24:47,455 --> 01:24:52,582
I think, Polly, you may have said in your presentation like a draft next date for this proposal, but if you did, I missed it.

760
01:24:55,645 --> 01:24:59,510
We have a number of proposals that are all currently in progress.

761
01:25:00,271 --> 01:25:01,253
Sorry, did you have a date for that?

762
01:25:01,273 --> 01:25:02,975
I want to say it if you did, but it's okay if you don't.

763
01:25:05,648 --> 01:25:13,355
So we are proposing to the next planning permitting committee meeting to come back with the proposal for sorry.

764
01:25:13,375 --> 01:25:14,396
I'm trying to yeah.

765
01:25:14,796 --> 01:25:15,296
No, that's okay.

766
01:25:15,336 --> 01:25:15,537
I'm sorry.

767
01:25:15,557 --> 01:25:18,519
I don't have a proposal of the squares again.

768
01:25:18,619 --> 01:25:33,252
So to look at what we talked about Medford Square in West Medford, um, and also the 80 years so that we can look at those, um, and maybe continue the discussion or to be referred to the city board.

769
01:25:33,817 --> 01:25:34,017
great.

770
01:25:34,197 --> 01:25:34,817
Thank you so much.

771
01:25:35,978 --> 01:25:43,301
So we will be discussing this proposal at our next planning and permitting committee, and it sounds like probably alongside the Medford Square proposal as well.

772
01:25:43,341 --> 01:25:44,022
Those will be April 30.

773
01:25:44,982 --> 01:25:47,883
All of these dates will be updated on the city's zoning website.

774
01:25:49,464 --> 01:26:02,810
And so we'll have another chance for committee members and members of the public and city staff to discuss them in this public meeting before the committee will potentially take a vote to refer it to the Community Development Board, where we'll have public hearings.

775
01:26:05,235 --> 01:26:14,879
So please save the date, April 30, if you want to be at the next Planning and Permitting Committee meeting about this topic.

776
01:26:15,999 --> 01:26:27,863
Myself with President Behrs, Director Hunt, and NS Associates are also working to schedule our next several public Q&As about this topic and many others, as you can see on this timeline in green.

777
01:26:28,843 --> 01:26:34,445
We are working out locations for those, so as soon as we have all of the details firmed up, we'll be sure to be publicizing those.

778
01:26:38,946 --> 01:26:43,047
Are there any additional questions or comments before we close out for the evening?

779
01:26:48,688 --> 01:26:54,170
Seeing none, thank you all so much for your questions and suggestions, and thank you so much, Paola, for the presentation.

780
01:26:55,430 --> 01:26:55,870
Is there a motion?

781
01:26:57,868 --> 01:26:59,829
hear a motion to adjourn from Councilor Lemming.

782
01:26:59,909 --> 01:27:00,490
Is there a second?

783
01:27:01,350 --> 01:27:01,710
Second.

784
01:27:02,631 --> 01:27:03,791
Seconded by President Behrs.

785
01:27:05,532 --> 01:27:07,614
Mr. Clerk, when you're ready, please call the roll.

786
01:27:14,798 --> 01:27:15,438
Councilor Callahan?

787
01:27:15,938 --> 01:27:16,138
Yes.

788
01:27:20,981 --> 01:27:21,462
Councilor Lemming?

789
01:27:21,482 --> 01:27:21,542
Yes.

790
01:27:23,503 --> 01:27:24,303
Councilor Scarpelli?

791
01:27:24,923 --> 01:27:25,224
Yes.

792
01:27:26,825 --> 01:27:27,345
President Behrs?

793
01:27:27,993 --> 01:27:28,274
Yes.

794
01:27:31,199 --> 01:27:31,400
Yes.

795
01:27:31,801 --> 01:27:33,344
Five in favor, none opposed.

796
01:27:33,404 --> 01:27:34,205
The meeting is adjourned.

797
01:27:34,386 --> 01:27:34,847
Thank you everybody.
