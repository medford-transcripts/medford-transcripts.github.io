1
00:00:00,692 --> 00:00:05,477
But because of the break, we're just trying to get ahead of it right away.

2
00:00:05,637 --> 00:00:06,058
Thank you.

3
00:00:06,158 --> 00:00:07,239
The good news is it's done.

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,822
I just haven't had a minute to get started.

5
00:00:09,842 --> 00:00:10,303
Fabulous.

6
00:00:28,435 --> 00:00:33,497
All right, well, it's 5.02, and maybe in the interest of time, I will just go ahead and start.

7
00:00:35,178 --> 00:00:35,698
Then we'll start.

8
00:00:37,099 --> 00:00:41,321
I will go ahead and read the meeting notice, and we can continue to let people in if people show up.

As approved by the committee on February 1st, 2023, the evaluation subcommittee will meet to review and develop the process for the 2022-23 superintendent evaluation.

19
00:02:15,973 --> 00:02:17,535
The agenda is as follows.

20
00:02:18,396 --> 00:02:18,516
One,

21
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:29,918
Develop a timeline for the 2022-23 superintendent evaluation process, including due dates for all parties involved and a tentative schedule of subcommittee meetings.

22
00:02:31,478 --> 00:02:41,664
Two, develop a process for the 2022-23 superintendent evaluation, including the timeline, templates, and instructions for school committee members.

23
00:02:43,065 --> 00:02:43,465
And three,

24
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:51,305
Discuss the types of evidence the superintendent will provide to document progress on the year's goals and selected indicators.

25
00:02:53,646 --> 00:02:56,328
And, oh, I just realized, are we missing a member?

26
00:02:56,348 --> 00:03:01,872
I don't see Melanie McLaughlin on yet.

27
00:03:01,892 --> 00:03:04,674
Do you want me to, let me message her and see.

28
00:03:04,694 --> 00:03:05,615
Okay.

29
00:03:17,278 --> 00:03:18,779
I just got a message.

30
00:03:24,201 --> 00:03:25,441
She just sent me a message.

31
00:03:26,221 --> 00:03:27,602
I'm going to resend her the link.

32
00:03:28,902 --> 00:03:28,982
OK.

33
00:03:29,022 --> 00:03:35,665
All right, we'll wait a minute for her, and we'll call the roll.

34
00:04:18,484 --> 00:04:27,408
She said she may have to hop off to take an important call, but she was going to hop on shortly.

35
00:04:27,528 --> 00:04:34,771
So I don't know if we just want to get started and we can bring her into the attendance when she arrives.

36
00:04:35,671 --> 00:04:35,931
Sure.

37
00:04:36,451 --> 00:04:37,172
I wasn't sure.

38
00:04:38,472 --> 00:04:39,933
Two out of three of us, we can do the meeting?

39
00:04:40,033 --> 00:04:40,133
OK.

40
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,861
Okay, so I will call the roll then.

41
00:04:44,282 --> 00:04:44,882
Member Graham?

42
00:04:45,843 --> 00:04:46,043
Here.

43
00:04:47,344 --> 00:04:48,565
Member McLaughlin?

44
00:04:49,226 --> 00:04:49,946
Oh, there she is.

45
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,228
Member McLaughlin, hi.

46
00:04:51,608 --> 00:04:52,228
Calling the roll.

47
00:04:52,288 --> 00:04:53,109
Member McLaughlin?

48
00:04:55,871 --> 00:04:56,232
She's here.

49
00:04:56,252 --> 00:04:57,373
Oh, she just needs a minute.

50
00:05:04,739 --> 00:05:07,181
And then you have to call yourself as part of the roll.

51
00:05:08,222 --> 00:05:08,402
Yes.

52
00:05:08,803 --> 00:05:09,183
Okay, so.

53
00:05:10,158 --> 00:05:12,739
Member Glaufen is present, just connecting.

54
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,880
And Member Hayes, present.

55
00:05:16,081 --> 00:05:16,901
Present, thank you.

56
00:05:16,921 --> 00:05:18,322
I couldn't get to the unmute button.

57
00:05:18,422 --> 00:05:18,822
Thank you.

58
00:05:19,742 --> 00:05:20,303
No problem.

59
00:05:21,543 --> 00:05:22,804
So let's see.

60
00:05:22,964 --> 00:05:29,667
So just to give a brief introduction as to why we're here for anyone who watches this who might not have seen our last meeting.

61
00:05:30,645 --> 00:05:43,212
We, the school committee had a retreat with Dorothy Presser from the Massachusetts Association of School Committees, who has also worked extensively with Jesse on the superintendent evaluation process.

62
00:05:43,913 --> 00:05:52,418
And through that retreat, she gave us a training, just an update on the superintendent evaluation process.

63
00:05:53,078 --> 00:05:59,582
And through that meeting, we realized there were a few updates we could make to our process to align it more closely with

64
00:06:00,183 --> 00:06:02,344
Desi's guidelines.

65
00:06:03,284 --> 00:06:09,845
So we had a committee of the whole meeting on February 1st, where we discussed some of the updates we wanted to make.

66
00:06:10,045 --> 00:06:21,108
And then at the regular school committee meeting on February 6th, the school committee approved some of those changes that we or

67
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:24,371
or approved some of the updates.

68
00:06:24,471 --> 00:06:31,838
And one part of that was also approval for a new subcommittee to be called the Superintendent Evaluation Subcommittee.

69
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:34,381
And this is our first meeting.

70
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:39,165
So I don't know how far to go in the background.

71
00:06:39,205 --> 00:06:44,891
Some of the things that have already been approved that were approved on February 6th,

72
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:58,337
included this year, rather than using a number rating system, we would use the word-based rating system that is in the DESE guidelines.

73
00:06:58,397 --> 00:07:09,924
We'd be using, really following that very closely, using their wording for rating the superintendent, those words like exemplary, proficient, needs improvement, and unsatisfactory.

74
00:07:11,644 --> 00:07:31,737
that we would, the subcommittee would be responsible for compiling, creating the process for the evaluation this year and also compiling all of the individual evaluations and creating the composite evaluations that we would then submit to the school, the full school committee for approval.

75
00:07:32,944 --> 00:07:41,389
We agreed that the superintendent's evaluation would include the raw data from all the members in addition to the composite evaluation of the subcommittee.

76
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:50,415
And we also approved nine indicators that we would use from the superintendent evaluation rubric.

77
00:07:51,616 --> 00:07:57,499
This year, we chose nine indicators that would most closely align with the superintendent's goals.

78
00:07:59,221 --> 00:08:00,501
So for this first meeting,

79
00:08:02,938 --> 00:08:31,132
I thought, and obviously members can chime in and let me know what they think, maybe we should start with the actual timeline, kind of work backward from the date where we want to have the final meeting of where we approve the composite evaluation, and then kind of work backward from there, and that would determine then also we could look at what meetings the subcommittee needs to have based on that timeline.

80
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:34,266
Any thoughts?

81
00:08:37,588 --> 00:08:38,549
That sounds good to me.

82
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:51,937
So are you going to like sort of share like a doc to look at the timeline and then just sort of work together to identify dates backward or what the milestones are for moving the dates backward?

83
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:56,740
So I don't actually have anything to share, but I can talk about that.

84
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,921
I mean, I did make myself a

85
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,138
a personal agenda for this meeting.

86
00:09:01,178 --> 00:09:08,820
So I can say, you know, what I have down is that we would need to start really with the final date, right?

87
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:13,062
That final composite evaluation date, sometime probably late in June.

88
00:09:13,082 --> 00:09:25,166
And then working backward from there would be the dates, let's see, the dates by which the members would need to return their individual evaluations.

89
00:09:26,264 --> 00:09:34,371
And then before that would be the date by which we would provide those, the templates for those evaluations to the members.

90
00:09:35,352 --> 00:09:45,180
And prior to that would be the date of the, I think last year it was a committee of the whole meeting, um, where the superintendent prevent, uh, presented herself evaluation to us.

91
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:54,307
So our two scheduled meetings in June are, um, June 5th and June 12th.

92
00:09:54,668 --> 00:09:54,868
Yes.

93
00:09:55,957 --> 00:10:11,185
Um, and the other thing that we need to add to the timeline is that we would need to vote in a, um, regularly scheduled school committee meeting to accept like anything that comes out of a committee of the whole.

94
00:10:11,345 --> 00:10:22,731
So, um, the committee of the whole would have to happen or we would need to call a special school committee meeting late in the month to simply adopt what comes out of the committee of the whole.

95
00:10:23,411 --> 00:10:24,692
So, um,

96
00:10:25,505 --> 00:10:40,177
I think it would be ideal if the committee of the whole could occur before the 12th, because then we could not be trying to sort of shove another meeting into the calendar in June, given all that goes on in June.

97
00:10:40,337 --> 00:10:49,905
But I think that does present some questions about the timeline and when it's reasonable to start this process.

98
00:10:50,426 --> 00:10:53,248
Because if you back up from there, like we're probably,

99
00:10:53,927 --> 00:11:00,670
starting to work at the beginning of May for the superintendent to be saying to us, like, this is what I've accomplished this year.

100
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:04,952
And I starting at the beginning of May is pretty early.

101
00:11:05,433 --> 00:11:09,895
So can I just get some clarification?

102
00:11:09,915 --> 00:11:11,355
Sharon?

103
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:11,455
Yes.

104
00:11:13,781 --> 00:11:20,686
So, um, essentially what I think I heard a member Graham saying is that committee of the whole to discuss.

105
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:28,272
The data that we're all coming back to the table with, uh, not a committee of the whole to approve the template.

106
00:11:28,472 --> 00:11:28,752
Right.

107
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:30,233
Correct.

108
00:11:30,813 --> 00:11:31,094
Okay.

109
00:11:31,414 --> 00:11:32,314
Just wanted to clarify.

110
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,856
So I think that, thank you.

111
00:11:35,016 --> 00:11:35,977
So I think that, um,

112
00:11:37,849 --> 00:11:39,590
You know, we have to report out from this committee.

113
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:46,254
So I think that if we could have a date that we're getting the template out, that we know that that's coming in a date that we know that it's due.

114
00:11:46,955 --> 00:12:00,604
And, you know, then we can have obviously a better idea when the superintendent is available to, to speak to, you know, what she needs to speak to, but we're already February 16th, which is making me feel like, ah, right.

115
00:12:00,724 --> 00:12:05,267
Because we need time to also do the evaluation when we need time to create the template.

116
00:12:06,928 --> 00:12:10,270
Well, I don't know if we need to, well, I think that's a separate issue of what template.

117
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:15,432
There are some templates we could just, there is a DESI template, but that was later on the agenda.

118
00:12:15,452 --> 00:12:30,419
But I think that we need to know when the final, I think we need to start with when we know the final is gonna be and work backwards, because we could choose a date on, if we'd start with choosing a date when we're going to hand out the template,

119
00:12:31,723 --> 00:12:37,545
then we move forward and find that doesn't work because we don't have enough time to complete the whole thing before we have a meeting.

120
00:12:38,165 --> 00:12:42,067
I feel like we need to, I think working backwards seems to make more sense.

121
00:12:42,467 --> 00:12:51,050
If we know when we're gonna have that final meeting, then we start talking backwards about how long we need to, because we are gonna need some time to create that composite.

122
00:12:54,331 --> 00:12:56,051
And then that would work backwards from there.

123
00:12:56,572 --> 00:13:00,373
So if we get a sense of when the final meeting would be,

124
00:13:02,003 --> 00:13:09,248
Do we have, is there any reason why we can't have another, I know we have two regularly scheduled meetings already set.

125
00:13:09,808 --> 00:13:25,919
Is there, I don't know if there's a rule that says we can't have another meeting, if we, because if we start pushing it back to May, then we're, I don't know, it feels like we're cutting off a couple of months, but maybe that's, I've only done one before, so maybe that's the way it's always kind of worked.

126
00:13:28,581 --> 00:13:29,722
We can have another meeting.

127
00:13:30,563 --> 00:13:41,596
Um, the problem with that is there's going to be other reasons to have other meetings in June around the budget and like graduation and all the other things superintendent, if you want to play.

128
00:13:42,772 --> 00:13:43,252
Yeah, okay.

129
00:13:43,473 --> 00:13:43,793
Thank you.

130
00:13:44,353 --> 00:13:46,976
I was going away and you were reading my mind.

131
00:13:48,297 --> 00:13:59,927
Because the first normally it's the first Wednesday of the month is high school graduation, which would be June 7 Wednesday the seventh times the rain date would be that Thursday.

132
00:14:00,628 --> 00:14:03,850
So, with our two meetings being Monday, June 5.

133
00:14:05,447 --> 00:14:09,591
graduation is the 7th, and our next meeting being June 12th.

134
00:14:10,132 --> 00:14:16,839
And we know what happens as we get to June around the budget season.

135
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,343
I, you know, I would propose

136
00:14:23,218 --> 00:14:34,973
If it's going to be a committee of the whole for that committee of the whole to take place that last week of, of, I mean, it could be June 1, Thursday, the first or something like that to do.

137
00:14:38,297 --> 00:14:45,783
I don't know if that's enough time though, if you'd want me to present on Thursday, June 1st, or do you wanna bring it back at least one more week?

138
00:14:46,443 --> 00:14:53,969
Because school right now, I believe it's scheduled to close on June 16th for students.

139
00:14:54,790 --> 00:15:06,239
And so we would be focusing primarily on any last minute budget things, which budget meetings do end up taking time.

140
00:15:09,235 --> 00:15:15,202
I'm thinking with the idea of mapping, working backwards and mapping it out.

141
00:15:16,964 --> 00:15:25,334
To Member Graham's point, because the 12th is our last official regular scheduled meeting, we may end up having other special meetings or whatever the case may be.

142
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:28,819
It really should be prior to June 5th.

143
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:42,546
even if it was the, and I don't know how much time you as the committee membership think you need to complete the tool.

144
00:15:43,846 --> 00:15:55,073
So if you're thinking, if we want to announce it at the June 5th meeting or the June 12th at the latest,

145
00:15:56,397 --> 00:16:10,721
If it's announced at the June 12th meeting, what was discussed at the committee of the whole for that to be approved, that is bringing us into like the second week of May, third week of May potentially.

146
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:18,663
So do you have an idea of how long you think the members would like to have the tool in hand?

147
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,442
Can I just ask a question, Sharon?

148
00:16:22,922 --> 00:16:23,123
Yes.

149
00:16:24,023 --> 00:16:24,524
A few things.

150
00:16:24,664 --> 00:16:29,328
One is, it's a little confusing for me just without any visuals or anything like that.

151
00:16:29,348 --> 00:16:38,335
So I'm wondering if one, if there's anyone that might be willing to just like share a screen for others to see, just sort of even a calendar screen from like now to, thank you, Jenny.

152
00:16:38,876 --> 00:16:47,423
So yeah, but even like the calendar, so we can sort of look at the dates just from, you know, February through June or something,

153
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:49,547
yearly calendar or something.

154
00:16:49,587 --> 00:16:50,648
I don't know that we're looking at dates.

155
00:16:50,668 --> 00:16:54,268
So we're actually looking back at what we're trying to do would be helpful.

156
00:16:54,328 --> 00:17:05,851
But I guess I'm also trying to understand that what we're saying is, so it's February 16th, we have X weeks till, you know, we wanna have the due date for the final.

157
00:17:06,071 --> 00:17:09,192
And I'm assuming when we're saying final evaluation, we're talking about,

158
00:17:09,672 --> 00:17:24,176
the evaluation that we're bringing back to the whole committee to, you know, open whole committee, regular school committee meeting where we're approving or presenting the evaluation and then voting to approve it.

159
00:17:24,336 --> 00:17:29,917
So, you know, how many weeks between now and then, and what actually are we trying to achieve in those weeks?

160
00:17:29,937 --> 00:17:34,278
And if I understood you, Sharon, what we're saying is that we need one to create the template

161
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:50,457
you know, two, to give the members time to fill out the template, you know, three, the superintendent presenting on, you know, what she's done for submitting the, or just, I don't know if we have discussion first before submitting and then,

162
00:17:50,877 --> 00:17:52,797
you know, five submit for approval.

163
00:17:52,897 --> 00:17:56,038
So is that, are those like the five steps we're talking about?

164
00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:58,158
Yeah, Jenny had them up a minute ago.

165
00:17:58,539 --> 00:17:59,459
She had typed them out.

166
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:05,340
And I think that was pretty much, I think the creation of the template, I mean, we could go and start with that if you want.

167
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:15,902
There is a template that Desi provides that, I mean, I don't know that we need to recreate the wheel, but we can look at it and see if we feel like that would work.

168
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,361
Yeah, I'm not sure that I need that.

169
00:18:18,401 --> 00:18:18,681
I guess.

170
00:18:18,721 --> 00:18:19,781
Thank you, Jenny, for that list.

171
00:18:19,801 --> 00:18:20,622
That's super helpful.

172
00:18:20,962 --> 00:18:30,727
And then I think just looking at, you know, what the, what the, when we find the final delivery and sort of, you know, looking at the weeks, I don't know what this is.

173
00:18:31,207 --> 00:18:31,928
I think it just changed.

174
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:32,328
Okay.

175
00:18:32,348 --> 00:18:37,731
So regular committee of the whole to agree, review and agree prior to six, five.

176
00:18:37,811 --> 00:18:38,091
Right.

177
00:18:38,671 --> 00:18:46,155
And then the subcommittee meets to compile a recommendation responses due from committee template distributed to committee superintendent presents evidencing now.

178
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:50,583
So yeah, I think we need to, one, two, three, four, five.

179
00:18:50,783 --> 00:18:58,769
I think we need like between, honestly, probably eight weeks from 6-13 start point to achieve those things.

180
00:18:58,809 --> 00:19:03,753
So whatever, you know, eight weeks back from 6-13 is, what would that date be?

181
00:19:04,653 --> 00:19:11,678
I was gonna say, it's about 13 weeks between the last week of February and bringing us to the last week of May.

182
00:19:11,698 --> 00:19:11,738
So,

183
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:16,711
You just said you want to do how many weeks, Member Graham?

184
00:19:16,771 --> 00:19:17,852
I said roughly eight weeks.

185
00:19:17,912 --> 00:19:25,676
If we have five items on here and we need maybe two, I'm saying seven to eight weeks back to the date from 6-13.

186
00:19:25,716 --> 00:19:27,957
Thank you for the calendar, whoever put that up.

187
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:33,480
Sorry, my phone screen's not allowing me.

188
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,201
So whatever, eight weeks.

189
00:19:37,942 --> 00:19:39,603
Well, do we want to put in and say then?

190
00:19:40,103 --> 00:19:42,684
I mean, I think this kind of general eight weeks,

191
00:19:44,382 --> 00:19:48,326
we need to work with how much, because we're gonna need a couple of weeks to compile, I would say.

192
00:19:48,346 --> 00:19:51,949
Yeah, so I counted two weeks on that line, sorry.

193
00:19:51,989 --> 00:20:00,257
And then two weeks for, I don't know, I don't remember last year if we had a week or two weeks for members to fill out the template.

194
00:20:01,298 --> 00:20:03,641
It was like 10 days, I think, maybe two weeks.

195
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:07,044
So if that's-

196
00:20:09,016 --> 00:20:14,521
I was gonna say most likely it's gonna be more realistic to have me present at some point in May.

197
00:20:16,042 --> 00:20:33,198
I know it will shorten the timetable, but then if I present to you in May and you as the committee take about two weeks to process the information and do everything, that'll bring us back to early June.

198
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:38,562
Right, so if you present in early May, sorry, through the chair, Sharon, is it okay if I say something?

199
00:20:38,602 --> 00:20:39,402
Sure, of course.

200
00:20:39,782 --> 00:20:51,266
So if you present in early May and we back that out two weeks before that for us to get the templates to everybody, then we're talking mid-April to get our templates out, right?

201
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,507
For a deadline for the template.

202
00:20:54,527 --> 00:20:56,688
So basically what I'm saying is just take June 13th,

203
00:20:57,633 --> 00:21:00,996
and back it up eight weeks, because I included two weeks for us to get ready.

204
00:21:01,016 --> 00:21:07,381
I mean, two weeks for us to have the template, say a week or so to get the template, the superintendent's presentation.

205
00:21:07,401 --> 00:21:10,944
So roughly it's like eight weeks, and then you just build your weeks after that.

206
00:21:10,964 --> 00:21:12,426
All right, well, why don't we do that?

207
00:21:12,486 --> 00:21:20,032
So if we say that, so if we're going to have the 6-12 meeting, the date at which we approve it at the full committee.

208
00:21:20,092 --> 00:21:21,733
Yeah, we vote on it, yeah.

209
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:22,374
Vote on it.

210
00:21:25,469 --> 00:21:26,369
then go back.

211
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:28,451
I think, Jenny, you actually kind of have it there.

212
00:21:28,771 --> 00:21:29,211
Let's see.

213
00:21:30,472 --> 00:21:31,092
We have some of it.

214
00:21:31,112 --> 00:21:35,874
Yeah, I was just trying to, like, work through the calendar.

215
00:21:35,914 --> 00:21:45,719
So if we're trying to, like, be able to make our vote on the 12th, we could, working backwards, right, have a committee of the whole prior to our 6-5 meeting.

216
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:49,601
So we could do our committee of the whole from, like, whatever it is, 5-6 or 5-30 to 6-30.

217
00:21:49,681 --> 00:21:50,581
And then I think

218
00:21:54,488 --> 00:22:04,455
working backwards, like we, this committee, I think we need two weeks to be able to like take all the data and like work through this process, right?

219
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:10,960
So that would mean like everybody would have to give us their responses by 521, which is a Sunday.

220
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:18,005
And if you back up two weeks from that, like the superintendent would present her evidence, like somewhere around the eighth.

221
00:22:18,885 --> 00:22:23,949
And that would give us two weeks from that time, like, and we would distribute the template that day.

222
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:29,382
Because we shouldn't be doing an evaluation before the superintendent has presented her evidence.

223
00:22:29,482 --> 00:22:38,645
So if we like looked at 5A as like the jumping off point, I just haven't looked at where the meeting's at.

224
00:22:39,585 --> 00:22:39,945
Sorry.

225
00:22:41,506 --> 00:22:46,207
So 5A would be like a committee of the whole where the superintendent would present her self-evaluation?

226
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:49,068
Yeah.

227
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:50,729
Yeah, 5A or 5-5, whatever.

228
00:22:50,829 --> 00:22:54,410
But what we're saying is that this subcommittee

229
00:22:55,178 --> 00:23:08,489
would need to sensibly, at least a week before that, so again, back in April, so end of April, mid-April, where we have a process, we begin, whatever, we do a template design.

230
00:23:08,509 --> 00:23:13,053
I don't know if we wanna have another meeting to review the template design or not.

231
00:23:13,774 --> 00:23:16,096
We may not need to depending on

232
00:23:16,875 --> 00:23:19,216
if it's as simple as Sharon saying, but we may.

233
00:23:19,736 --> 00:23:21,697
But I think we need to have the template ready.

234
00:23:21,717 --> 00:23:28,481
We need to be able to have time to work on the template at least a week before it goes to the committee on the 8th.

235
00:23:29,221 --> 00:23:39,086
So whether that's Monday the 1st or the end of April, whatever, a deadline for us to have the template done or at least be working on it.

236
00:23:40,298 --> 00:23:43,719
So we want to schedule a meeting in April to look at a template together?

237
00:23:43,739 --> 00:23:44,940
I think so.

238
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:58,485
I think for the end of the last week of April, I mean, before we come to the meeting, we might want to individually work on a template that you're saying if DESE has it, and then come to the meeting, maybe end of April, subcommittee meeting.

239
00:23:59,614 --> 00:24:02,336
I can, I was going to share, I can share that today.

240
00:24:02,356 --> 00:24:05,499
I mean, it could even be that we do a template today.

241
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:09,181
It's pretty straightforward, but we can come to that.

242
00:24:09,201 --> 00:24:14,045
I don't know if we want to feel like we're jumping around if we, but we can take a look at that.

243
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:16,126
So we can, we can look at that tonight.

244
00:24:16,346 --> 00:24:27,094
And if we want to work on it more than we could schedule a meeting just to go over the template and create the template or alter it in any way we see necessary.

245
00:24:28,128 --> 00:24:34,953
I would back that up a little bit just to have the time if we needed, if we were going to do that, kind of the technical how to make it work.

246
00:24:35,653 --> 00:24:41,717
I know the previous one we were using, I think took a lot of work from member Rousseau to make it work for everyone.

247
00:24:41,777 --> 00:24:48,042
So I think if we're gonna create a new one, we'd wanna have some time to really work on it.

248
00:24:49,683 --> 00:24:50,504
Well, I think,

249
00:24:54,932 --> 00:24:58,593
I think I have an idea in my mind how the template could be laid out.

250
00:24:59,733 --> 00:25:01,294
Would you like to see the DESI one?

251
00:25:01,314 --> 00:25:04,835
Yeah, sure.

252
00:25:04,855 --> 00:25:08,936
I mean, it's just like the description and then the boxes, right?

253
00:25:10,456 --> 00:25:10,776
Yeah.

254
00:25:11,056 --> 00:25:13,397
I mean, it's really pretty simple.

255
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:14,617
Let's see.

256
00:25:15,697 --> 00:25:17,938
I think the bigger question is,

257
00:25:19,074 --> 00:25:25,577
to build it in such a way that it is not like many, many, many hours of manually intensive work on the backend.

258
00:25:26,278 --> 00:25:29,419
And I think I know how to do that.

259
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:38,704
So I'd be happy like prior to whatever this meeting is to like take a shot at putting something together to bring and show you all what I'm thinking.

260
00:25:40,025 --> 00:25:41,826
Can I, I don't know if I'm, am I sharing right now?

261
00:25:42,726 --> 00:25:43,827
Cause I've never shared before.

262
00:25:44,247 --> 00:25:45,608
So this is the DESI one.

263
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:52,102
Yeah, I wouldn't wanna use this one because it's a PDF and you can't copy and paste.

264
00:25:53,202 --> 00:26:00,284
It will need to be in a Google Doc of some kind to be easy, but the whole thing can be just replicated into a Google Doc, which is fun.

265
00:26:00,824 --> 00:26:02,664
Right, which is, yes, that was my thought.

266
00:26:02,704 --> 00:26:08,026
I think my software husband said he could probably could figure that out.

267
00:26:08,766 --> 00:26:12,147
So, I mean, it's pretty straightforward and I think it's pretty easy to use.

268
00:26:13,418 --> 00:26:27,957
So, and I would just say, if we could, if the superintendent's gonna present on the eighth, I think it makes more sense for us to be on, maybe it's on an agenda in April, for us to at least show the forum.

269
00:26:28,618 --> 00:26:44,091
To the rest of the committee, let them know how it works, you know, do they have any questions, you know, everything else I as opposed to just like, okay, hearing the superintendent on the eighth and being like okay we're going to send you the form and you're all set like I think it's a good opportunity to just like.

270
00:26:45,232 --> 00:26:50,436
share the form beforehand, make sure everybody understands how it's working, you know, and everything else.

271
00:26:50,456 --> 00:26:56,880
So again, I think that we need to have a meeting, whether you guys decide whether we all decided it should be, it could be a subcommittee meeting.

272
00:26:57,041 --> 00:27:07,568
And you know, we come to the committee on the following on the eighth, but even then people aren't going to have the opportunity to really, you know, look at the form and have questions if it's a subcommittee meeting, unless they're attending the subcommittee.

273
00:27:08,235 --> 00:27:25,838
or you know it's sent to the committee and they can review it as a document without discussing it with each other and come to the meeting on the 8th if they have questions either or but I guess all that to say is that I think there should be an opportunity for the rest of the committee to see the form and ask questions if they have any.

274
00:27:27,358 --> 00:27:37,720
I guess I would just do that at the meeting on the 8th because it would be a committee of the whole so everyone would be there the superintendent could present her evidence and then we could walk through how to use the template.

275
00:27:38,827 --> 00:27:43,490
Do you think there's going to be enough time for her to present her evidence and for us to do the template in a committee of them?

276
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:49,474
I mean, a committee of the whole could be any amount of time we think we need.

277
00:27:49,554 --> 00:27:49,875
Right.

278
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:53,717
So, and I think that's a day, let me listen to the calendar.

279
00:27:53,937 --> 00:27:58,060
Um, I think that's a day where we don't have a schedule.

280
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,823
We don't have a scheduled meeting that Monday, so we could just do this.

281
00:28:04,047 --> 00:28:06,068
I didn't know if it was before the scheduled meeting or not.

282
00:28:06,168 --> 00:28:09,309
So to the chair, I mean, that works for me.

283
00:28:09,469 --> 00:28:22,193
If it's a Monday that we don't have it and it's just the committee of the whole for the eighth and if the superintendent thinks that that's enough time and we can do both her presentation and the forum, then yeah, that makes sense.

284
00:28:25,854 --> 00:28:27,775
Do you wanna weigh in Dr. Edward-Rinson?

285
00:28:28,593 --> 00:28:29,294
I'm muting myself.

286
00:28:29,735 --> 00:28:41,431
Yeah, no, I just was looking at the calendar since it's not a scheduled meeting, I could definitely do that on Monday the eighth, and be prepared to present the evidence that I have.

287
00:28:44,570 --> 00:29:02,379
So I would make a motion that the superintendent does the presentation for evaluation on the eighth and that the committee of the whole and that committee of whole also includes a template review for the template that will be used for the evaluation process.

288
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,601
I need a second.

289
00:29:08,682 --> 00:29:09,743
Okay, and so I take a vote.

290
00:29:10,535 --> 00:29:11,055
Is that correct?

291
00:29:12,055 --> 00:29:12,896
Yes, you do a roll.

292
00:29:13,396 --> 00:29:13,676
Okay.

293
00:29:14,856 --> 00:29:30,201
Roll call vote on having a committee of the whole on Monday, May 8th, that would include the superintendent self-evaluation and the presentation of the template for individual members to use for their individual member evaluation of the superintendent.

294
00:29:31,362 --> 00:29:32,042
Member Graham?

295
00:29:33,002 --> 00:29:33,242
Yes.

296
00:29:34,823 --> 00:29:35,603
Member McLaughlin?

297
00:29:36,683 --> 00:29:36,963
Yes.

298
00:29:37,744 --> 00:29:38,344
Member Hayes?

299
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:38,644
Yes.

300
00:29:39,802 --> 00:29:40,642
Uh, motion passes.

301
00:29:42,723 --> 00:29:43,243
Thank you.

302
00:29:43,343 --> 00:29:46,865
And do we want to vote on the rest of the dates or should we just propose them?

303
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:51,486
Um, I think we can just propose them.

304
00:29:51,506 --> 00:30:01,090
Um, I don't think scheduling requires a vote, but I think the superintendent will need to work with the mayor, the mayor to, to confirm that these dates work.

305
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:02,370
Okay.

306
00:30:03,435 --> 00:30:11,000
So what I have written down then is the 12th, at the meeting on June 12th, we would have that final vote by the whole committee.

307
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:17,385
It's a regular school committee meeting to approve the evaluation, the composite evaluation.

308
00:30:17,405 --> 00:30:26,331
And then on the 5th, the week before, we would have a committee of the whole before the regular meeting to review.

309
00:30:28,412 --> 00:30:29,553
Let's see, what do I have written down here?

310
00:30:32,803 --> 00:30:34,204
Sorry, does anyone have the rest of that?

311
00:30:35,265 --> 00:30:46,935
On the fifth it was, so before we vote to approve, we would have the committee of the whole to review the composite evaluation.

312
00:30:47,275 --> 00:30:50,758
Oh, that's right, we'd have to have a committee of the whole to review that.

313
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,761
And then we would vote on it on the 12th.

314
00:30:56,783 --> 00:31:01,127
Then prior to that, we have the eighth for the,

315
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:04,915
superintendent self evaluation and present the template.

316
00:31:06,256 --> 00:31:12,280
And then we need a deadline for the school committee members to get the evaluation back to us.

317
00:31:13,001 --> 00:31:13,261
Yes.

318
00:31:15,182 --> 00:31:21,046
So if we want to give them two weeks from the eighth, I think we, Oh, I hear, I have that written down.

319
00:31:21,066 --> 00:31:24,289
We said something like Sunday, the 21st.

320
00:31:25,069 --> 00:31:27,451
So that would give them almost two weeks.

321
00:31:28,732 --> 00:31:30,293
We're going to share this document.

322
00:31:31,542 --> 00:31:35,083
And then we can obviously this will be in the minutes for the next meeting.

323
00:31:35,123 --> 00:31:36,504
So everybody has these dates.

324
00:31:37,204 --> 00:31:39,025
So we don't have to motion obviously for them.

325
00:31:39,945 --> 00:31:41,325
What's the document you're sharing?

326
00:31:41,345 --> 00:31:46,327
Hold on.

327
00:31:46,607 --> 00:31:46,867
Yeah.

328
00:31:56,931 --> 00:31:57,971
Try typing in Parker.

329
00:32:04,725 --> 00:32:08,166
All right, I'll do that in just a second.

330
00:32:08,686 --> 00:32:09,166
There you are.

331
00:32:09,186 --> 00:32:14,227
Hi, MPACA.

332
00:32:14,327 --> 00:32:29,471
There you are.

333
00:32:34,958 --> 00:32:36,579
Okay, so you all have access to that now.

334
00:32:46,363 --> 00:32:46,763
Okay.

335
00:32:51,325 --> 00:32:57,948
So we'll be looking at, so 522 to have a subcommittee meeting, okay.

336
00:32:58,508 --> 00:32:59,289
That makes sense.

337
00:33:00,669 --> 00:33:01,790
And I would say it doesn't have to be

338
00:33:02,532 --> 00:33:05,973
Monday, but there is no school committee meeting that week.

339
00:33:06,634 --> 00:33:06,874
Yes.

340
00:33:06,894 --> 00:33:10,535
So that would be fine.

341
00:33:10,995 --> 00:33:12,816
That works for me if we want to do it on Monday.

342
00:33:13,916 --> 00:33:14,857
Yeah, that works for me.

343
00:33:14,877 --> 00:33:18,378
And then Monday, what are you guys talking about, the 8th?

344
00:33:18,598 --> 00:33:21,179
Oh, no, what date are you talking about?

345
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:21,379
The 22nd.

346
00:33:21,439 --> 00:33:22,339
On Monday, the 22nd.

347
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:22,860
Yeah, the 22nd.

348
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:23,960
Yeah, I see it.

349
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:32,103
So the question I have, if I can, Sharon, is for the committee designs template and instructions and plan to compile,

350
00:33:32,617 --> 00:33:34,278
Are we having a subcommittee meeting for that?

351
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:38,679
So item one.

352
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:44,542
We certainly can look for one, sure.

353
00:33:50,064 --> 00:33:51,645
So looking back at April.

354
00:33:52,005 --> 00:33:56,086
There is no school committee meeting.

355
00:33:56,307 --> 00:33:56,967
I like that.

356
00:33:56,987 --> 00:33:57,927
Yeah, that would be good.

357
00:33:58,107 --> 00:33:58,147
OK.

358
00:34:18,574 --> 00:34:21,376
All right.

359
00:34:22,136 --> 00:34:25,838
So in addition to that, let's see.

360
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,101
So timeline templates and instructions.

361
00:34:35,182 --> 00:34:42,185
So I think what we're looking at, although we talked about developing them today, it looks more like we've developed the timeline for developing those.

362
00:34:46,935 --> 00:34:47,375
That works.

363
00:34:49,576 --> 00:34:55,180
Do we want to meet even earlier than 4-24 to work on the template, just in case we need more than one meeting?

364
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,021
Can I ask a question?

365
00:34:59,982 --> 00:35:00,302
Sure.

366
00:35:00,402 --> 00:35:01,883
Clarification point of information.

367
00:35:02,304 --> 00:35:09,728
So if I think if I understood member Graham correctly, she was going to take the, you know, essentially the

368
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:26,367
template, if you will, from DESI and incorporate it into a Google sheet or Excel doc, that would be easier to populate and calculate for all of the members.

369
00:35:26,828 --> 00:35:29,329
Is that what I understood?

370
00:35:30,149 --> 00:35:31,170
Yeah, I'm happy to do it.

371
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:34,171
I mean, I don't remember if you were planning to do that.

372
00:35:34,331 --> 00:35:37,233
Yes, I can take a shot at that, too, so it's not falling all on you.

373
00:35:38,859 --> 00:35:46,821
Yes, I do think, as I said, I think my husband said there was a way, there was a way he could do it, he just didn't have time to do it before this meeting.

374
00:35:47,281 --> 00:35:53,182
So I will work on that and bring that.

375
00:35:54,802 --> 00:36:03,304
Obviously I can send you guys, send you all some work in progress as we're working on it if we wanna take a look at it while it's,

376
00:36:04,613 --> 00:36:08,534
while he's working on it, so you can see if there's anything we want to change or add to it.

377
00:36:08,974 --> 00:36:13,496
And then we can talk about it more at that meeting on 4-24.

378
00:36:13,516 --> 00:36:23,159
I actually don't think you can do that because the open meeting law prohibits deliberation.

379
00:36:24,019 --> 00:36:29,601
I think she can send the document, but I don't think we can discuss it with each other unless I'm mistaken.

380
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:33,402
And we can clarify that, but I think we can look at the document in advance.

381
00:36:34,631 --> 00:36:38,993
so that we can bring questions to the table, but I don't think that we can discuss it.

382
00:36:39,093 --> 00:36:44,436
I know that we can discuss it amongst ourselves before then, but having it to look at could be helpful.

383
00:36:44,996 --> 00:37:03,864
And then also, I don't know if you guys want to, if somebody, I don't know if it's you member Hayes or what, but wants to sort of start with some instructions and, you know, and steps for it so that we have a jumping off point.

384
00:37:04,812 --> 00:37:11,777
for the meeting on the 24th in terms of filling it out, but I guess that's up to you or us to decide.

385
00:37:11,857 --> 00:37:15,279
But I think that we can see the template ahead of time.

386
00:37:15,319 --> 00:37:16,440
We just can't discuss it.

387
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:17,761
Is that your understanding?

388
00:37:21,203 --> 00:37:23,525
I am not an expert on open meeting laws.

389
00:37:23,625 --> 00:37:24,546
So I don't know.

390
00:37:24,566 --> 00:37:27,548
I mean, we could also, I can work on it.

391
00:37:27,628 --> 00:37:29,229
I can get to work on it now.

392
00:37:29,309 --> 00:37:33,912
And if it seems like it's not going to be doable easily, then we can look at

393
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:38,744
maybe scheduling another meeting to look at making our own if we want to.

394
00:37:38,764 --> 00:37:47,267
It seems like it should be, I would think that Desi should have a version of it.

395
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:49,888
My other thought was simply to get in touch with Desi and ask.

396
00:37:50,609 --> 00:37:58,371
There's gotta be a version of it somewhere that school committees can use because that seems to be their recommended template.

397
00:37:59,472 --> 00:37:59,712
So.

398
00:38:00,392 --> 00:38:03,273
I guess I think the value of the template is the compilation

399
00:38:04,187 --> 00:38:10,712
And I wouldn't expect SD to have a template because everybody chooses like different ways to compile.

400
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:15,615
So I think that it's, to me, it's not about the form that you fill out so much.

401
00:38:15,655 --> 00:38:19,038
It's about like, does that form translate easily into compilation?

402
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:26,563
So maybe they do, but I didn't get that sense when we did the training.

403
00:38:26,583 --> 00:38:29,885
Okay, I can work on it and see, I can work.

404
00:38:34,295 --> 00:38:37,576
I can work with my husband on it and we can see if we can get it translated.

405
00:38:37,596 --> 00:38:55,743
I mean, it seems like a pretty user-friendly version of it and easily, to me anyway, it looked pretty easily translatable into a composite in terms of having the information clearly laid out and with the check boxes are pretty easy for members to just have to check off their ratings.

406
00:38:57,803 --> 00:38:58,904
Can I make a recommendation?

407
00:39:00,164 --> 00:39:07,628
I would just suggest maybe having the, if we could have the subcommittee meeting earlier than 424, just like a week or so.

408
00:39:07,688 --> 00:39:18,334
I don't know if that's, you know, the same night as the committee, but I think it should be fairly, hopefully a fairly easy meeting to go over the template.

409
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:28,840
But if we have it before, it might give us a little bit more time to think about if there's any, you know, things that we need to,

410
00:39:29,577 --> 00:39:38,124
work on between 424 and 58 in terms of the compilation or instructions or any reviews that we need to do or whatever.

411
00:39:38,204 --> 00:39:39,465
So leaving this subcommittee.

412
00:39:39,485 --> 00:39:41,286
Are you guys following me?

413
00:39:41,566 --> 00:39:41,786
Yes.

414
00:39:42,227 --> 00:39:42,447
Yes.

415
00:39:45,269 --> 00:39:48,912
Do we want to just maybe meet in late March even to look at it?

416
00:39:48,932 --> 00:39:59,160
So we have lots of leeway in case there are changes that need to be made and we could look at that last week of March even.

417
00:40:00,097 --> 00:40:01,038
Yeah, I would like that.

418
00:40:02,139 --> 00:40:22,294
Yeah, I would like that just because I think it gives the opportunity to sort of look at it, give it some thought, you know, think about what the compilation can be have some discussion around what that might look like, and then allow us to help contribute collectively if we can to instructions and the plan for compilation, but that's just me, I like to have a little bit more time, like I don't want to be right up against

419
00:40:22,963 --> 00:40:31,569
the superintendent's presentation, you know, and to have the form ready, I'd like to make sure that we're all, we have all the kinks ironed out ahead of time.

420
00:40:31,589 --> 00:40:32,569
Okay.

421
00:40:34,391 --> 00:40:35,531
So we'll do that on the 27th.

422
00:40:35,672 --> 00:40:38,033
We don't have a regular meeting scheduled, so.

423
00:40:38,754 --> 00:40:39,014
Yeah.

424
00:40:40,895 --> 00:40:48,040
So do that instead of the April 24th, but then we would have time if we felt like we needed to schedule another one sometime in April, we could.

425
00:40:49,038 --> 00:40:52,941
Yeah, I would keep the 24th as like a penciled in, to be honest, just in case.

426
00:40:52,961 --> 00:40:59,465
Yeah, so I would make that as a number two, just so we don't lose it.

427
00:40:59,485 --> 00:41:17,398
All right, so in terms of our agenda for tonight, developing the actual templates and instructions

428
00:41:18,958 --> 00:41:29,681
it's more, we're gonna do that during subsequent subcommittee meetings, but we have the timeline, which was one of our major goals.

429
00:41:33,142 --> 00:41:42,965
So I think that's really it for the superintendent evaluation process in terms of what we had for kind of the organization of it.

430
00:41:43,325 --> 00:41:47,847
The third, well, unless anyone has something I missed, because there is a third agenda item,

431
00:41:48,799 --> 00:41:49,960
is somewhat separate.

432
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:58,708
That's a discussion of the type of evidence for the superintendent that had been on our last meeting, but we never, we didn't end up with time to talk about that.

433
00:41:59,428 --> 00:42:09,537
I wanted to leave some time to do that, just especially if the superintendent felt like she wanted some information from us about that.

434
00:42:09,917 --> 00:42:11,699
I did, I can also share the,

435
00:42:13,413 --> 00:42:19,358
There's examples on the DESE website of types of evidence for each of the indicators.

436
00:42:20,659 --> 00:42:28,246
Just examples, we can always change or alter or add our own ideas to it.

437
00:42:30,107 --> 00:42:35,012
But let me, I can bring that up and people can see.

438
00:42:36,733 --> 00:42:38,315
Still getting used to screen sharing.

439
00:42:38,475 --> 00:42:39,796
Let's see, where would that be?

440
00:42:43,015 --> 00:42:46,557
Let's see.

441
00:42:49,979 --> 00:42:50,399
There.

442
00:42:54,061 --> 00:42:54,982
Is that showing up?

443
00:42:55,282 --> 00:42:56,262
Did I do that right?

444
00:43:00,285 --> 00:43:00,565
Yes.

445
00:43:00,885 --> 00:43:01,405
Yes, it should.

446
00:43:02,406 --> 00:43:02,726
Thank you.

447
00:43:07,504 --> 00:43:08,445
We could look through these.

448
00:43:08,545 --> 00:43:14,010
I have the indicators that we chose, so we could look through the types of evidence.

449
00:43:17,653 --> 00:43:19,535
Could you possibly make it a little larger?

450
00:43:20,596 --> 00:43:21,296
Just a little bit.

451
00:43:22,698 --> 00:43:24,940
Does anyone know how to tell me to do that?

452
00:43:26,121 --> 00:43:26,561
Let's see.

453
00:43:27,562 --> 00:43:28,323
Oh, how's that?

454
00:43:28,343 --> 00:43:32,046
OK, it's better, definitely.

455
00:43:32,066 --> 00:43:32,607
Did it get bigger?

456
00:43:32,727 --> 00:43:32,827
OK.

457
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,861
Now, oh, there we go.

458
00:43:37,101 --> 00:43:38,481
I just wanted to make sure I knew how to scroll it.

459
00:43:39,342 --> 00:44:00,911
So the indicators that we chose, or that we, with the superintendent's input chose, so under standard one, instructional leadership, we had 1B and 1E, which is on the next page.

460
00:44:02,391 --> 00:44:03,992
So 1B, instructional,

461
00:44:06,145 --> 00:44:08,227
Instructional instruction indicator.

462
00:44:08,567 --> 00:44:15,192
There's examples are aggregated classroom walkthrough observation data and aggregated student feedback.

463
00:44:20,296 --> 00:44:22,037
Does anyone have any thoughts about that?

464
00:44:22,057 --> 00:44:23,238
I mean, I think the I know.

465
00:44:23,538 --> 00:44:27,861
Go ahead, sorry, go ahead.

466
00:44:27,881 --> 00:44:28,762
I didn't mean to interrupt you.

467
00:44:29,482 --> 00:44:32,865
Oh, well, I was just going to say I know that the superintendent I think is doing.

468
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:38,582
classroom walkthroughs I think you have a different name for it, but so having that information.

469
00:44:38,602 --> 00:44:43,903
I think you might already have that so that would be a good thing to.

470
00:44:45,184 --> 00:44:49,585
Maybe to to choose as one of the pieces of evidence.

471
00:44:50,807 --> 00:44:52,228
And I like the student feedback.

472
00:44:52,348 --> 00:44:56,529
I mean, we didn't do this last year in terms of what evidence was going to be brought forward.

473
00:44:56,569 --> 00:45:06,193
So I do want to ask if it's okay, member Hayes, the superintendent sort of, is this useful for us to go through this?

474
00:45:06,633 --> 00:45:07,613
That's a good question.

475
00:45:07,733 --> 00:45:07,973
Yes.

476
00:45:09,194 --> 00:45:14,456
What we want, or is it, or can you sort of look at the form and get that yourself?

477
00:45:14,536 --> 00:45:15,356
What do you, what do you think?

478
00:45:18,693 --> 00:45:27,618
It is, it's useful just to hear what are the types of pieces of data you're gonna be looking for, for the specific indicators, so.

479
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:28,579
Okay.

480
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:31,621
I like the aggregated student feedback.

481
00:45:31,661 --> 00:45:43,528
I mean, I think that you're, you know, we know that the instructional observations or instructional, I forget what you call them too, superintendent walkthroughs, what do you call them?

482
00:45:44,248 --> 00:45:46,009
We call them walkthroughs, we call them rounds.

483
00:45:46,409 --> 00:45:47,550
Yeah, instructional rounds.

484
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,302
But I think the student feedback would be good too, just to understand.

485
00:45:53,502 --> 00:45:55,624
And again, this is specific to instruction.

486
00:45:57,345 --> 00:46:05,050
So one question I would have at this point in the year, since we're already headed into March, I like the idea of student feedback.

487
00:46:05,090 --> 00:46:06,611
I think that's necessary at some point.

488
00:46:07,832 --> 00:46:14,936
I guess my question for the superintendent would be, is that something you can get within the next two and a half to three months?

489
00:46:15,597 --> 00:46:17,738
Because I don't know what form that would take.

490
00:46:18,253 --> 00:46:24,475
And I'm just wondering if that's something you might need more planning for instructional student feedback.

491
00:46:25,235 --> 00:46:30,496
I, you know, we're going to be doing the survey, but I have not.

492
00:46:32,377 --> 00:46:34,117
I don't have like a concrete.

493
00:46:38,718 --> 00:46:54,999
about student feedback unless you could be talking about like exit tickets that taking a sampling of exit tickets that are used, primarily at like secondary level of where students are giving feedback on content that was being taught, but.

494
00:46:58,364 --> 00:47:10,184
the indicator of student feedback, if it's something like that, I could definitely start gathering samples of student feedback for specific instructional

495
00:47:11,648 --> 00:47:20,052
content area so people could see how students are responding, like what did they learn, what stood out for them in a particular content area.

496
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:36,020
But in terms of, if you were to ask me today, give me a document that shows student feedback, I've never captured student feedback on instruction, aside from looking at their outcomes.

497
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,161
But to have students saying, you know,

498
00:47:40,038 --> 00:47:45,740
I think I got a B minus because I didn't understand, blah, blah, blah.

499
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:52,703
To give their rationale, I would have to hear what you were thinking about for that type of an indicator.

500
00:47:52,723 --> 00:47:58,905
Because it's not something, even with the rounds, and we would do the five core actions,

501
00:48:00,052 --> 00:48:07,735
That was looking at the instruction and looking for key indicators that were taking place in the classroom.

502
00:48:08,315 --> 00:48:18,619
And so, yes, we would be looking for evidence of productive struggle, for example, or listening to the questions, discourse, the student discourse that was happening.

503
00:48:18,939 --> 00:48:20,199
But that would be an adult.

504
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:27,604
you know, using the tool and looking at, oh, there was evidence of productive struggle.

505
00:48:28,184 --> 00:48:32,567
There were, you know, the students turned and talked six times in a 40-minute block.

506
00:48:32,647 --> 00:48:35,369
They, you know, worked with one another.

507
00:48:35,509 --> 00:48:37,111
They created a poster.

508
00:48:37,151 --> 00:48:38,211
They created a chart.

509
00:48:39,492 --> 00:48:45,957
So I would need to know specifically what student feedback

510
00:48:47,434 --> 00:48:53,335
what you would want as student feedback, because that is something that I have not been gathering.

511
00:48:54,035 --> 00:49:01,137
And exit tickets are, like in my mind, it's a check for understanding when they use the exit tickets.

512
00:49:01,177 --> 00:49:02,737
Did they understand the concept?

513
00:49:02,797 --> 00:49:05,618
And then, you know, they do it before they leave.

514
00:49:05,778 --> 00:49:12,259
And then the teacher scores what was on the exit ticket or reflects on what the students wrote.

515
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:14,140
And then they may make,

516
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:20,883
adjustments to teaching the following day based on what was said on a type of exit ticket.

517
00:49:21,563 --> 00:49:24,024
So I want to be honest about that.

518
00:49:25,025 --> 00:49:27,986
Okay I see two members have their hands raised.

519
00:49:28,046 --> 00:49:29,867
I wasn't looking up to see who it was first.

520
00:49:30,567 --> 00:49:34,929
I can wait.

521
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:37,171
Okay to member Graham.

522
00:49:37,191 --> 00:49:41,433
I think well I had a question and then a comment.

523
00:49:41,453 --> 00:49:42,213
So my question is

524
00:49:42,775 --> 00:49:47,699
Can you remind me what the actual indicator that we picked was?

525
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:50,501
Yes.

526
00:49:51,242 --> 00:50:10,517
So it says, let's see, 1B, instruction ensures that practices in all settings reflect high expectations regarding content and quality of effort and work, engage all students,

527
00:50:10,942 --> 00:50:16,845
and are personalized to accommodate diverse learning styles, needs, interests, and levels of readiness.

528
00:50:23,048 --> 00:50:23,868
Okay.

529
00:50:24,249 --> 00:50:29,051
I guess my comment is maybe more broad.

530
00:50:29,791 --> 00:50:36,915
I guess I could see how student feedback would fit in there, but to the points being made like that is like getting

531
00:50:38,138 --> 00:50:40,759
feedback to check a box is not what I think we want.

532
00:50:40,919 --> 00:50:45,920
And to get good, authentic, like meaningful feedback is not something that can happen very quickly.

533
00:50:47,321 --> 00:50:57,484
But I guess I would also say that I don't feel particularly inclined to be prescriptive about what evidence the superintendent brings forward.

534
00:50:57,504 --> 00:51:04,006
Like she is the expert in this space and it's sort of up to her,

535
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:10,451
to decide what the things are, right, that are gonna demonstrate her work and her performance.

536
00:51:11,591 --> 00:51:27,834
And I think if there's something particular that we definitely wanna see, that's fine, but I actually am not super inclined to like be prescriptive about this because I just think like evidence can come in all different ways.

537
00:51:28,294 --> 00:51:32,895
And frankly, the superintendent is the expert, not the rest of us.

538
00:51:34,690 --> 00:51:37,652
We sort of defer to her judgment about what those things are.

539
00:51:39,953 --> 00:51:40,474
Okay.

540
00:51:40,534 --> 00:51:42,735
Member McLaughlin, did you want to talk?

541
00:51:43,552 --> 00:51:44,232
Yes, thank you.

542
00:51:44,593 --> 00:51:52,977
So I guess that was sort of what I was saying at the beginning of this is like, do we want to defer to the superintendent about this or do we want to go through these items?

543
00:51:53,557 --> 00:51:55,318
And so that's what I'm trying to understand.

544
00:51:55,338 --> 00:52:03,383
I think that we can defer to the superintendent and I agree, we don't need to be prescriptive about what's brought to the table for her to show evidence.

545
00:52:03,563 --> 00:52:07,325
I do think there's an opportunity to say, these are things that I'm interested in.

546
00:52:07,865 --> 00:52:11,327
And what I guess I'm saying is I am interested in student feedback.

547
00:52:11,747 --> 00:52:18,652
And so it doesn't mean that I need to have a specific survey of students, and it is prescriptive to what this looks like.

548
00:52:18,712 --> 00:52:33,903
Is it prescriptive to the high quality of the instruction that they feel like they're getting, whether the instruction's differentiated, whether there's, you know, but some evidence of student feedback on instruction would be useful in terms of we have this much enrollment in these classes.

549
00:52:33,963 --> 00:52:37,986
We've seen that this particular class has, you know, is really, you know,

550
00:52:40,287 --> 00:52:52,331
always received sort of positive remarks about what's being done here and, and or, you know, we have some work to do in this particular arena around, you know, differentiated instruction or access to curriculum or whatever.

551
00:52:52,892 --> 00:53:01,855
And here's how we know based on, you know, student import or student, you know, qualitative, not quantitative necessarily data, but I guess.

552
00:53:02,668 --> 00:53:10,234
in as a whole, and sort of talking about this, this is the point is that discussion points around things that could be brought forward and things that we might be interested in.

553
00:53:10,635 --> 00:53:13,657
But again, we're three of seven that might be interested in these things.

554
00:53:13,697 --> 00:53:27,709
So obviously, I don't think it is prescriptive, even going back to the subcommittee, to the committee, when we report out, you know, I'm sure people can add things that they feel like is important, but I think it's a good opportunity, certainly to go through some of the goals and say, Oh, what does Dessie have under this?

555
00:53:27,869 --> 00:53:29,350
And why does Dessie have these under there?

556
00:53:29,794 --> 00:53:31,275
you know, how could this be captured?

557
00:53:31,335 --> 00:53:40,202
And again, if it's not captured this year in terms of, you know, a more quantitative process, then maybe next year we do want it to be as a quantitative process.

558
00:53:40,242 --> 00:53:43,204
So it's sort of a work in progress in terms of figuring that out.

559
00:53:44,124 --> 00:53:45,585
But I think it's good to have the discussion.

560
00:53:45,606 --> 00:53:54,352
And I guess what I would like to say is I do, I am interested in hearing student feedback around instruction and quality of instruction and also differentiation of instruction.

561
00:53:55,493 --> 00:53:55,773
Thanks.

562
00:53:57,472 --> 00:53:58,074
Superintendent.

563
00:53:59,579 --> 00:54:00,281
So, um.

564
00:54:01,548 --> 00:54:03,509
Having said that, thank you for that feedback.

565
00:54:04,889 --> 00:54:19,374
Member Hayes, if it's possible, I was gonna ask if I could just, where I know you were going through the key indicators that the committee identified, if I could just quickly share my screen for a second.

566
00:54:19,394 --> 00:54:23,335
I want you to stop sharing yours temporarily.

567
00:54:24,275 --> 00:54:28,577
If you stop temporarily, I could share my screen because

568
00:54:32,098 --> 00:54:33,660
Oh, Dr. Cushing.

569
00:54:38,006 --> 00:54:38,727
I don't think I'm.

570
00:54:41,944 --> 00:54:47,327
Okay, I'm not able to, I don't have that.

571
00:54:47,387 --> 00:54:51,089
It's saying that the host didn't allow me to do that.

572
00:54:51,689 --> 00:55:03,275
So what I was getting ready to do was I was gonna pull up my goals and say that last year, one of the challenges was I presented the goals.

573
00:55:03,335 --> 00:55:04,316
I know it's in the drive.

574
00:55:05,817 --> 00:55:09,859
But Jenny and Sharon are co-hosts, so they should be allowed to let you share your screen.

575
00:55:11,703 --> 00:55:13,324
I don't know how to do that.

576
00:55:14,485 --> 00:55:16,847
It has to be Dr. Cushing and I'm not sure.

577
00:55:16,867 --> 00:55:20,590
He might've stepped away.

578
00:55:23,332 --> 00:55:27,435
But essentially what I wanted to do was I wanted to show my goals.

579
00:55:28,395 --> 00:55:30,717
Just one second, please.

580
00:55:47,632 --> 00:55:50,753
Dr. Cushing said, I'm now able to.

581
00:55:50,973 --> 00:55:52,034
Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

582
00:55:55,315 --> 00:56:05,640
So in the past, when I would present my goals, I presented the goals and then I would provide evidence.

583
00:56:06,850 --> 00:56:15,193
But at that point in time, we were using the entire DESI instrument, which is massive.

584
00:56:15,313 --> 00:56:18,494
And there are a significant number of indicators.

585
00:56:19,294 --> 00:56:32,619
So for this year, now, even though we did it in reverse order, but moving forward now, it will be more logical because we came down to the agreed upon, I believe, eight indicators.

586
00:56:33,479 --> 00:56:35,200
And what the indicators are,

587
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:46,271
I will look at what the goals were the district improvement goal, the student learning goal, and the professional practice goal, and I will align these goals.

588
00:56:48,922 --> 00:56:54,208
to the indicators that you the committee said these are the indicators you want to focus on.

589
00:56:54,709 --> 00:57:07,883
So, where you specifically said about student feedback, and at this point in time I don't have a way of getting student instructional feedback I'd have to go back and really look at that in a

590
00:57:09,565 --> 00:57:17,556
a specific way to see how could I gather this, that might be an indicator where I'm able to say I wasn't able to provide evidence.

591
00:57:18,037 --> 00:57:23,925
And so you, the committee, would give me feedback saying this is an area where we want you to provide greater evidence

592
00:57:24,366 --> 00:57:48,948
moving forward, but I will, you know, take the goals and look at what were the key actions that were actually able to be accomplished, which I had hoped to have accomplished over the course of this year, and then what were the proposed outcomes, and I would be able to, you know, provide some data supporting some of the proposed outcomes, and then keeping in mind

593
00:57:49,388 --> 00:58:15,458
the specific indicators that the committee selected to see how much of that I can align, like dovetail together to say these fall under 1B, this falls under 1E, 2, and possibly just take this document and put the indicators and provide the evidence for you, the committee, to be able to look at and say, OK, this is what's happening district-wide.

594
00:58:16,999 --> 00:58:18,488
You know, across the district.

595
00:58:19,193 --> 00:58:19,414
So,

596
00:58:21,886 --> 00:58:33,751
And right now where there are rounds taking place right now, but they are content-based rounds right now, those specific rounds are taking place with Ms.

597
00:58:33,791 --> 00:58:43,935
Galluzzi right now in the department heads, especially where we have had so much curriculum that's being revised and we're switching it over.

598
00:58:44,515 --> 00:58:49,437
But again, those would be pieces of evidence that I would also be able to share with the committee.

599
00:58:50,459 --> 00:59:08,705
So, I just wanted to quickly show that when I did do the goals and submitted them that I did list actions that we wanted to the key actions that we hope to accomplish this year, and then what those outcomes could look like.

600
00:59:11,467 --> 00:59:18,428
what's the SMART goal of saying like, what do we wanna see with our data for this particular year?

601
00:59:18,869 --> 00:59:23,549
So I will also report back on the status of these goals.

602
00:59:24,130 --> 00:59:32,551
And then again, you, the committee, now that we have the agreed upon indicators, you'll be able to give me feedback based on that.

603
00:59:32,591 --> 00:59:40,813
So I hope that that helps in terms of evidence that I'll be gathering and presenting to the committee.

604
00:59:43,464 --> 01:00:00,872
If I can just before I call on Member McLaughlin, so I just want to clarify too that my hope in doing this was more not to be prescriptive of what the superintendent should have to present to us, but I guess I'm always aiming for a clearer shared understanding of the expectations.

605
01:00:02,292 --> 01:00:05,514
So maybe this is more of an aspirational, maybe next year when the

606
01:00:07,139 --> 01:00:23,344
when the process, or hopefully next year, the process from the beginning, we choose these indicators, then maybe as part of that conversation, we talk about shared understanding of what the evidence, what the actual artifacts we'd like to see are, and what, again, a conversation.

607
01:00:23,364 --> 01:00:28,186
So it'd also be, of course, what you, superintendent, think you can provide and what makes sense to provide.

608
01:00:28,606 --> 01:00:36,349
But again, just the goal always being kind of more of a shared understanding of the expectations so we all know what's coming at the end.

609
01:00:38,261 --> 01:01:02,567
I just want to say personally from the person who was doing it the first time this past year, I guess one of the things I was hoping or wanted to talk a little bit about was just when we get your evidence, having perhaps more in some of those, more of an explanation from you about what the evidence you're providing means as opposed to just

610
01:01:03,272 --> 01:01:14,136
Sometimes you gave us links to things or told us, gave a list of professional development, perhaps for some of those giving more of an explanation of what came out of that professional development.

611
01:01:14,356 --> 01:01:19,878
Have you seen teachers using some of the information they got or your own professional development?

612
01:01:20,498 --> 01:01:22,959
What did you take away from that?

613
01:01:23,039 --> 01:01:30,802
And how did you see that affecting anything that you did later as the superintendent of our district?

614
01:01:30,862 --> 01:01:32,343
Just a little more of your,

615
01:01:33,163 --> 01:01:45,632
A little more understanding of how you see the evidence and tying it all together and, and how it's really making changes for our district, I guess, just more narrative, maybe.

616
01:01:45,652 --> 01:01:51,796
Yes, I can definitely provide a greater narrative because some of the.

617
01:01:54,757 --> 01:02:07,762
I think where some of the data is presented over the course of the year through school committee meetings and different things like certain pieces of the indicators, it was like, oh yeah, this is this indicator.

618
01:02:08,162 --> 01:02:16,186
So I can definitely provide greater narrative and also where it can happen.

619
01:02:17,330 --> 01:02:25,032
clearly call out what the indicator is now that I know the specific indicators, which it was trying to cover everything.

620
01:02:26,392 --> 01:02:38,254
Now that there's greater specificity, that's gonna help to be able to say like in this area, this is what was done or it wasn't done, due to different reasons.

621
01:02:38,854 --> 01:02:40,114
Right, okay, thank you.

622
01:02:40,735 --> 01:02:42,635
And member McLaughlin, did you still wanna speak?

623
01:02:43,685 --> 01:02:44,265
Yes, please.

624
01:02:44,305 --> 01:02:44,686
Thank you.

625
01:02:45,506 --> 01:03:06,818
I guess I just wanted to add, you know, to that, that, you know, I think the process is gonna be much improved, obviously, now that we have, you know, clear indicators and that there's some specificity and that the indicators can be linked to, you know, both quantitative and qualitative data that the superintendent will provide the narrative and the hard data around that as well.

626
01:03:06,858 --> 01:03:09,499
And I think that this is a really important point to point out.

627
01:03:09,859 --> 01:03:12,881
This is why professional development for school committee is really important.

628
01:03:13,421 --> 01:03:19,243
And that we understand that so that people aren't just sort of building the plane as it's flying and that we know that, you know, there's a process.

629
01:03:19,303 --> 01:03:27,246
And so having had this MASC, you know, course on superintendent evaluation and having us all sit together and do some of that professional development was really important.

630
01:03:27,266 --> 01:03:29,367
And I think really helped define a lot of this for us.

631
01:03:29,407 --> 01:03:36,229
So I guess I just want to sort of put that out there too, that as we're also thinking about our own goals and our own evaluations of stuff.

632
01:03:36,588 --> 01:03:51,641
that we're realizing and recognizing that this is an important piece that we have to have professional development for us as well, so that we're understanding, you know, what the indicators are, what the process is, what it should look like and how it can be communicated both to us and to the community.

633
01:03:52,182 --> 01:04:00,689
And then, you know, with that said, I also wanna just add, since we're on the topic of instructional, you know,

634
01:04:02,433 --> 01:04:17,419
monitoring or evaluation or guidance or what have you, that I want to make sure that really encourage people to be thinking about all of our students and all of our student learners and in that we're providing material that is, you know, the scope of all the students.

635
01:04:17,439 --> 01:04:22,841
So we're talking about, you know, some of our different classroom settings across standard

636
01:04:23,362 --> 01:04:44,447
access, you know, AP, EL, that we are really looking at the entirety of the instructional rounds and what the data is that's being collected so that, you know, we're getting those answers from all perspectives because I really obviously am interested in curriculum levels, access to curriculum, differentiated instruction for all of our students.

637
01:04:44,487 --> 01:04:45,667
So I think that would be great.

638
01:04:45,767 --> 01:04:46,127
Thank you.

639
01:04:48,247 --> 01:04:48,607
Thank you.

640
01:04:50,288 --> 01:04:50,688
All right.

641
01:04:51,829 --> 01:04:54,190
I think we've hit all of our agenda items.

642
01:04:54,951 --> 01:04:59,413
I don't know if other members can help me.

643
01:04:59,453 --> 01:05:02,934
Do I need to make any motions or is there anything I need to do to?

644
01:05:03,574 --> 01:05:05,535
No, we're all set.

645
01:05:07,276 --> 01:05:10,338
You just need a second and a roll call.

646
01:05:10,418 --> 01:05:10,778
All right.

647
01:05:11,858 --> 01:05:13,539
So motion to adjourn, second from?

648
01:05:13,559 --> 01:05:14,920
Second.

649
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:17,361
