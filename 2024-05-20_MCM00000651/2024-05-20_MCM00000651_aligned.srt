00:00:00,051 --> 00:00:03,892
Hello, and welcome to this regular meeting of the Medford Zoning Board of Appeals.

2
00:00:04,553 --> 00:00:06,833
We're going to take a quick roll call, and then we'll get started.

3
00:00:09,074 --> 00:00:09,914
Jamie Thompson?

4
00:00:10,955 --> 00:00:11,255
Present.

5
00:00:12,635 --> 00:00:13,316
Andre LaRue?

6
00:00:14,196 --> 00:00:14,556
Present.

7
00:00:15,896 --> 00:00:19,878
Yvette Velez, I don't think is present yet.

8
00:00:21,358 --> 00:00:25,220
Jim Tarani, also I don't think is present yet.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,681
Mary Lee?

10
00:00:28,521 --> 00:00:28,881
Present.

11
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:31,200
Chris D'Avetta.

12
00:00:34,522 --> 00:00:34,742
Here.

13
00:00:36,363 --> 00:00:37,984
And Mike Caldera present.

14
00:00:38,044 --> 00:00:41,025
So we have five members of the board present.

15
00:00:42,186 --> 00:00:44,647
And so we'll get started.

16
00:00:45,187 --> 00:00:46,308
Dennis, can you please kick us off?

17
00:00:51,356 --> 00:01:00,384
On March 29th, 2023, Governor Healey signed into law a supplemental budget bill, which, among other things, extends the temporary provisions pertaining to the open meeting law to March 31st, 2025.

18
00:01:00,584 --> 00:01:10,572
Specifically, this further extension allows public bodies to continue holding meetings remotely without a quorum of the public body physically present at any location and provide adequate alternative access to remote meetings.

19
00:01:11,093 --> 00:01:17,518
The language does not make any substantive changes to the open meeting law other than extending the expiration date and the temporary provisions regarding remote meetings from March 31st, 2023 to March 31st, 2025.

20
00:01:21,444 --> 00:01:21,799
Thank you.

21
00:01:22,603 --> 00:01:31,410
And folks, before we get started with our typical agenda items, the board is required annually to elect a chair from its membership.

22
00:01:32,231 --> 00:01:35,773
So we're just going to quickly go through that procedural step.

23
00:01:37,355 --> 00:01:44,420
And so the way this works, I will ask members for nominations.

24
00:01:46,121 --> 00:01:51,506
If a member is nominated and they accept, then once we know who has been nominated, we're going to vote.

25
00:01:52,126 --> 00:01:52,867
in our new chair.

26
00:01:54,589 --> 00:02:04,540
And so one thing I'll just lead off in saying is that it has been my absolute pleasure to serve as chair of this body over the past year.

27
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,664
I really genuinely enjoy it and I think we've done a bunch of good work.

28
00:02:10,326 --> 00:02:13,127
I'm planning to give another member a turn.

29
00:02:13,488 --> 00:02:21,172
I think it will be healthy for the board to have multiple members who are capable of serving in the chair capacity.

30
00:02:21,712 --> 00:02:28,476
And so for that reason, I would like to nominate Jamie Thompson as the next chair of the Medford Zoning Board.

31
00:02:31,998 --> 00:02:33,259
I'd like to make a motion.

32
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:34,960
OK.

33
00:02:36,201 --> 00:02:36,941
Thank you, Andre.

34
00:02:36,961 --> 00:02:37,982
So that's seconded.

35
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:44,998
Are there any other members who would like to nominate someone else as our next chair?

36
00:02:45,018 --> 00:02:51,903
And by the way, Mary and Chris, you're designated voting for this.

37
00:02:57,887 --> 00:02:58,187
All right.

38
00:02:58,727 --> 00:03:00,949
Jamie, I didn't hear if you said anything.

39
00:03:00,969 --> 00:03:02,410
Do you accept the nomination?

40
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,311
I do accept.

41
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:04,791
Thank you.

42
00:03:04,992 --> 00:03:05,112
OK.

43
00:03:05,532 --> 00:03:05,892
Wonderful.

44
00:03:05,932 --> 00:03:08,114
So then we're going to take a vote.

45
00:03:09,047 --> 00:03:11,189
Um, it's a roll call vote.

46
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:13,670
Um, Mary Lee.

47
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:16,592
Hi, Christy.

48
00:03:16,633 --> 00:03:16,953
Aveda.

49
00:03:16,973 --> 00:03:20,375
Hi, Andre LaRue.

50
00:03:21,016 --> 00:03:23,077
Hi, Jamie Thompson.

51
00:03:29,161 --> 00:03:32,944
Jamie, your connection may have cut out at an opportune time.

52
00:03:35,787 --> 00:03:37,328
You probably have some stain anyways.

53
00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:40,830
Well, customarily, but you don't actually have to.

54
00:03:41,991 --> 00:03:44,412
Um, well, we'll count that as an abstain.

55
00:03:44,773 --> 00:03:44,933
Yep.

56
00:03:45,033 --> 00:03:49,195
I just turned video off or suddenly reconsidering life choices.

57
00:03:49,956 --> 00:03:51,977
Um, Mike Caldera.

58
00:03:52,237 --> 00:03:53,138
I, all right.

59
00:03:53,338 --> 00:03:55,139
Uh, congratulations, Jamie.

60
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:59,282
You are now officially ZBA chair.

61
00:03:59,442 --> 00:04:02,684
I will change my title accordingly.

62
00:04:08,974 --> 00:04:09,456
Am I back?

63
00:04:10,258 --> 00:04:10,900
You are back.

64
00:04:14,271 --> 00:04:14,994
And you are chair.

65
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:15,977
Please take it away.

66
00:04:29,517 --> 00:04:32,940
All right, looks like Jamie's having some technical issues.

67
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:45,992
So we're going to at least dispense of the business that I think requested continuation or needed to be continued or withdrawn.

68
00:04:46,012 --> 00:04:49,155
So let me just pull up my notes.

69
00:04:49,175 --> 00:04:50,696
OK.

70
00:04:54,428 --> 00:05:03,617
My understanding, Dennis, is that we received a request to withdraw without prejudice from Zero Windsor Road.

71
00:05:03,677 --> 00:05:04,478
Is that correct?

72
00:05:04,498 --> 00:05:06,379
That is correct, yes.

73
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,120
OK.

74
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:14,127
Do we have anyone for Zero Windsor Road that would like to speak on this matter before the board votes?

75
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:21,866
Okay, I don't see it.

76
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:43,267
So my understanding from members of the public is that during the last hearing, there was a question of whether the lots in question had merged under the merger doctrine, and so didn't get a full explanation for the withdrawal, but that might

77
00:05:43,936 --> 00:05:48,098
be an indication the applicant's rethinking their strategy, but wants to preserve options.

78
00:05:48,198 --> 00:06:00,985
So I see no reason to not to grant the request, but I want to check in with the board if anyone has thoughts before we vote.

79
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:11,110
OK, don't see any.

80
00:06:13,702 --> 00:06:23,570
Acting chair awaits a motion to allow Zero Windsor to withdraw without prejudice.

81
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:29,535
Seconded.

82
00:06:30,035 --> 00:06:32,137
Someone needs to make the motion, so that can be you, Chris.

83
00:06:33,578 --> 00:06:33,878
OK.

84
00:06:34,558 --> 00:06:35,359
I will make the motion.

85
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:36,660
Do I have a second?

86
00:06:38,522 --> 00:06:38,922
Seconded.

87
00:06:39,963 --> 00:06:40,243
All right.

88
00:06:40,263 --> 00:06:41,704
We're going to take a roll call.

89
00:06:41,724 --> 00:06:42,264
Mary?

90
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:44,099
Aye.

91
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:45,340
Andre?

92
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,060
Aye.

93
00:06:47,421 --> 00:06:47,861
Chris?

94
00:06:48,802 --> 00:06:48,962
Aye.

95
00:06:50,563 --> 00:06:51,043
Jamie?

96
00:06:51,063 --> 00:06:53,745
Aye.

97
00:06:54,645 --> 00:06:55,365
OK, that worked.

98
00:06:55,646 --> 00:06:55,886
Yay.

99
00:06:56,106 --> 00:06:56,806
Am I back?

100
00:06:56,966 --> 00:06:57,607
Mike, aye.

101
00:06:57,947 --> 00:07:02,790
All right, so that matter is withdrawn, and I will hand it back to Jamie.

102
00:07:06,472 --> 00:07:07,672
So we'll see if this is stable.

103
00:07:07,692 --> 00:07:10,474
All right.

104
00:07:10,694 --> 00:07:11,074
Thank you, guys.

105
00:07:11,154 --> 00:07:12,335
I assume the vote went well?

106
00:07:13,576 --> 00:07:16,218
Yes, so you're the chair.

107
00:07:16,838 --> 00:07:22,201
We did zero Windsor, and that was withdrawn without prejudice.

108
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:35,369
And so I think the one other one that needs action out of order is, which one is it?

109
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,630
65 Sydney.

110
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:38,771
65 Sydney Street, yeah.

111
00:07:41,632 --> 00:07:42,613
So go ahead, Jamie.

112
00:07:44,844 --> 00:07:46,905
Dennis, could you read 65 Sydney Street for us?

113
00:07:47,085 --> 00:07:47,306
Sure.

114
00:07:48,186 --> 00:07:52,410
Well, 65 Sydney, case number 824-2024-10.

115
00:07:52,470 --> 00:08:04,339
Appointed owner Matthew Salamone, substituting for a variance of Chapter 94, City of Memphis Zoning, to construct a shed over 2 pence square feet at 65 Sydney Street, which is too close to the existing house on the side lot line, which is not allowed per the City of Memphis Zoning Ordinance, Chapter 94, Section 4.3.2.

116
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:04,619
Okay, and

117
00:08:15,653 --> 00:08:16,433
I could sort of jump in.

118
00:08:16,473 --> 00:08:24,315
So Mike and I talked about this before, you know, and basically what they submitted wasn't really enough to really move forward with the vote.

119
00:08:24,335 --> 00:08:26,776
So we're just going to, I'm asking the applicant to come into the office.

120
00:08:27,016 --> 00:08:36,718
He's coming in on Monday and he will, we're going to like just make sure we can get everything done because I was trying to speak to him before and he was unavailable to come in for a little bit.

121
00:08:36,918 --> 00:08:41,839
And we just want to make sure that they have a more full application other than what we had.

122
00:08:43,705 --> 00:08:51,309
Okay, do we want to vote on this worksheet and basically the worksheet really and some and maybe even just a hand drawn that sort of showing what's the location of it?

123
00:08:51,569 --> 00:08:53,810
Yeah, I think that would probably be enough to move forward.

124
00:08:55,651 --> 00:08:58,593
So we can put them on the agenda for next month and stuff.

125
00:08:58,633 --> 00:09:04,816
Anyone's here for, um, sitting 65 Sydney won't be hearing it tonight, but we will be hearing it under next meeting.

126
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:09,419
Hopefully the plan is, and if we do, I'll send out notices to you all.

127
00:09:10,205 --> 00:09:13,326
basically telling you what time and day the meeting will be held.

128
00:09:13,566 --> 00:09:17,348
Yes, Mr. Commissioner.

129
00:09:17,588 --> 00:09:18,588
I did want to comment.

130
00:09:19,389 --> 00:09:30,173
We do have a photograph of it, which is almost the best possible evidence, so he could come down to our office and we could print that up and he can attach it to the application.

131
00:09:30,193 --> 00:09:32,614
Okay, great.

132
00:09:35,255 --> 00:09:37,476
Yeah, he's supposed to be here on Monday, so when he does, I'll bring him down.

133
00:09:38,807 --> 00:09:42,228
All right, so we don't have a formal application, so we don't even have to vote on a continuance.

134
00:09:42,668 --> 00:09:43,088
Exactly.

135
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:49,950
Okay.

136
00:09:51,431 --> 00:09:54,712
Next item, then we'll go back to regular flow.

137
00:09:56,572 --> 00:10:00,173
Yep, so the next item is... 38 Harvard.

138
00:10:00,193 --> 00:10:02,874
38 Harvard Avenue, case number A-2024-03, continuing from March 28th.

139
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:11,639
Applicant and owner of 38 Harvard AV nominee trust restriction for variance in chapter 94 city methods only.

140
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:20,854
So, class to use motor vehicles at 38 Harvard Avenue, which is not allowed in the question 1 zoning district for the city efforts on chapter 94 table a table of use and parking regulations.

141
00:10:26,355 --> 00:10:27,956
and representative for the applicant.

142
00:10:28,637 --> 00:10:30,758
Good evening Chairman Thompson and board members.

143
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:34,520
I had to cross out Caldera on my notepad and write in Thompson.

144
00:10:36,001 --> 00:10:41,905
I'm here this evening with the manager of Obie's Auto Service and Collision, Orbelini Abazi.

145
00:10:42,885 --> 00:10:45,427
As you know, the petition was before you as a request.

146
00:10:45,907 --> 00:10:59,190
for an extension or change to a pre-existing non-conforming use in accordance with section 5.2 of the ordinance or alternatively a use variance to allow for the sale of a limited number of class 2 use vehicles on the premises.

147
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:10,793
At the meeting we had gone through the pretty much the facts and I'll go through those again but there was a question at the meeting with regard to the notice and whether it was sufficient to

148
00:11:11,942 --> 00:11:16,324
as it didn't include notices to the request for a special permit.

149
00:11:17,524 --> 00:11:33,191
The application and the signage, which was posted by the applicant, were in compliance and did indicate the fact that the applicant was looking for a special permit, alternatively a variance.

150
00:11:35,939 --> 00:11:51,067
There's also, I understand, a question from the building commissioner as to whether or not this can proceed under a special permit analysis as opposed to a variance request.

151
00:11:52,068 --> 00:11:58,591
I'd maintain that the case are, and in particular, the case that I had provided the board, Tickum,

152
00:11:59,932 --> 00:12:08,458
would indicate that this could go forward as a special permit inquiry as we have a pre-existing non-conforming use.

153
00:12:08,538 --> 00:12:23,107
This is an alteration or change of that use and under 5.2.1.2 it indicates specifically that if the board were to allow that use that no use variance would be required with regard to the use.

154
00:12:24,283 --> 00:12:35,070
And this provision is not unlike, there was a similar provision under the prior code which allowed for a substitution of a non-conforming use from one non-conforming use to the other.

155
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:49,180
I don't want to speak for the building commissioner in this instance but I did have some conversations with him and my understanding from the building commissioner is that he's taken the position that

156
00:12:50,063 --> 00:12:58,247
The structure itself, the auto body repair shop, is all that is under the pre-existing non-conforming umbrella.

157
00:12:58,267 --> 00:13:08,112
I maintain that, you know, that might be the case in a situation where you had, say, a shopping plaza and you had a non-conforming use within a plaza.

158
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,441
and you were substituting something in.

159
00:13:11,262 --> 00:13:24,452
But this is a collision and repair auto body shop where it would be atypical not to have a yard where you had vehicles which were being held for repair, vehicles that were repaired.

160
00:13:24,913 --> 00:13:29,056
And in collision as well, there are appraisals that occur.

161
00:13:29,116 --> 00:13:34,980
So there's operations vital to the business itself which occur within that parking area.

162
00:13:35,861 --> 00:13:51,565
I'd also point out to the board that under the parking regulations, any use related to a non-conforming principal use, if it were not pre-existing non-conforming, would need ZBA approval.

163
00:13:51,605 --> 00:13:54,806
So they would have had to have benevirians included in that.

164
00:13:55,826 --> 00:14:04,248
I had provided to the board previously the letter from Commissioner Moki, which after conferring with council,

165
00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:15,077
He indicated to the city council one point, I believe, when the petitioner was going for class to license that it was a pre-existing nonconforming use at 38 Harvard Ave.

166
00:14:15,538 --> 00:14:33,152
So I would maintain on that basis in the case law that we have a permissive zoning one bylaw, which is above and beyond what is permitted under section six, that the board could make a finding under this and issue a special permit rather than a variance.

167
00:14:35,832 --> 00:14:37,513
So that's a threshold question.

168
00:14:37,533 --> 00:14:49,355
I can certainly go through the presentation again for members who weren't here and move forward in that regard unless the board has questions at this point.

169
00:14:54,777 --> 00:14:58,757
So I'll open up to the board.

170
00:14:58,777 --> 00:15:00,958
Does the board, any members have any questions?

171
00:15:08,778 --> 00:15:12,160
Okay, so I have a question here.

172
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:23,607
So currently the premises, it sounds like it's a selling of services, correct?

173
00:15:23,627 --> 00:15:32,592
It's an auto body and collision shop, so it's auto repair and, you know, collision, so auto body and auto repair.

174
00:15:33,484 --> 00:15:34,664
So services.

175
00:15:35,244 --> 00:15:35,585
Correct.

176
00:15:36,365 --> 00:15:37,245
Correct.

177
00:15:37,285 --> 00:15:37,925
Vehicles in.

178
00:15:39,265 --> 00:15:45,207
So your request is for the selling of all those.

179
00:15:45,847 --> 00:15:46,027
Right.

180
00:15:46,087 --> 00:15:47,087
And it's very limited.

181
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:49,248
Correct.

182
00:15:50,108 --> 00:15:54,069
It's very limited, and he would still have to obtain a class two license.

183
00:15:54,749 --> 00:15:57,190
But what he's looking for, Dennis, can I share my screen?

184
00:16:03,222 --> 00:16:06,886
Let's see if this is here.

185
00:16:09,149 --> 00:16:09,650
Can you see?

186
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:09,930
No.

187
00:16:11,332 --> 00:16:11,772
It is here.

188
00:16:11,792 --> 00:16:13,354
Can you see that?

189
00:16:13,374 --> 00:16:17,419
Can everybody see the screen at this point?

190
00:16:17,619 --> 00:16:17,760
Yeah.

191
00:16:18,642 --> 00:16:22,525
So what he's proposing to do, this is the existing auto body shop.

192
00:16:23,486 --> 00:16:26,569
There are spaces out here for parking for customer.

193
00:16:26,929 --> 00:16:38,079
There's also this large back parking area where, like I said, vehicles are brought in, towed in, that need to be repaired because he handles a lot of insurance adjustment.

194
00:16:38,439 --> 00:16:59,934
claims for vehicles and repairs those based on you know losses coverage um so the vehicles that are repaired and already are here vehicles that need repair are here you know essentially it's a yard that services the repair the repair uh building uh the auto body shop itself what he proposes given the size of this is to to place

195
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,212
9 spaces are here on the plan.

196
00:17:03,232 --> 00:17:09,198
He doesn't anticipate that there would be more than 6 used vehicles for sale at any given time.

197
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,223
But it wouldn't, there would be no vehicles out in front of the premises.

198
00:17:14,684 --> 00:17:20,630
As I indicated at the last meeting, there isn't any intent to actually put any signage of any kind.

199
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:36,340
or advertisement on the property itself, it would be all to customers because frequently he has clients who come in, the vehicle's totaled, the insurance company says it's not fixable, and then they're looking at that point

200
00:17:37,422 --> 00:17:39,844
Where can I get a vehicle to get myself around?

201
00:17:39,884 --> 00:17:44,527
So this would be a service for existing customers and also internet sales.

202
00:17:44,667 --> 00:17:52,673
On a very small scale, sort of an accessory used to the auto repair, auto body shop that's existing.

203
00:17:53,994 --> 00:18:01,099
As I indicated previously, I think I indicated previously, although the use itself would require

204
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:07,400
to employee parking spaces just by virtue of the ordinance itself.

205
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:13,282
There isn't any intent to hire any sales staff as a part of this operation.

206
00:18:13,322 --> 00:18:16,363
It would just be cars that were fixed that he had.

207
00:18:16,423 --> 00:18:26,026
Sometimes customers come in and they don't want their car and might need some fine tuning or whatnot, but could be sold to somebody who's looking for a vehicle.

208
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:28,387
But there isn't any intent

209
00:18:28,987 --> 00:18:33,170
to change the hours of operation, which are eight to five, Monday through Friday.

210
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:36,512
There's no intent to have any additional sales staff.

211
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,894
It's not going to be any signage of any kind.

212
00:18:39,234 --> 00:18:56,045
This is more of an opportunity for him to, to when he has vehicles that have been fixed and, or, you know, he can fix possibly that, that have been totaled by an insurance company that, that he could sell those to existing customers or, or, you know, people in the community who are looking for,

213
00:18:56,652 --> 00:18:57,593
lower-priced vehicles.

214
00:18:57,613 --> 00:19:11,683
I mean, we all know what vehicles cost these days, and this would be, you know, vehicles that were probably in the more affordable range, which is typical with a Class 2, so it would be, you know, in the range of $8,000 to $12,000.

215
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:24,112
But in terms of the site itself, he's already operating the auto body repair shop, and these spaces are, you know, used in connection with the operation of the auto body repair shop.

216
00:19:24,172 --> 00:19:25,093
He's just looking to

217
00:19:25,546 --> 00:19:36,149
is an accessory used essentially, be able to sell a limited number of class two vehicles on the site to existing customers, because certainly there's a market for that.

218
00:19:36,969 --> 00:19:54,894
And also for community members who might be looking for a less expensive car than you would find at your dealership vehicles, which the sale of those vehicles are permitted in the C1 district by special permit, just not the class two.

219
00:19:56,913 --> 00:19:57,933
Does that answer the question?

220
00:19:58,954 --> 00:20:00,634
So I'm trying to understand.

221
00:20:00,674 --> 00:20:10,997
So, is there a change of use from services to a change of services to selling product?

222
00:20:11,057 --> 00:20:14,098
Because isn't there's a distinction if there is 1.

223
00:20:17,045 --> 00:20:32,949
Well, and I had given to the board originally originally this property was a dealership with a with a. With an auto body shop included, so to any of the short answer to your question is, yes, it would be a change or extension of what's existing pre existing nonconforming.

224
00:20:34,169 --> 00:20:36,069
And that's permitted under 5.2.1 to change.

225
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,252
a non-conforming use or to extend it.

226
00:20:41,372 --> 00:20:44,854
So in that regard, yes, it would be.

227
00:20:45,134 --> 00:21:01,102
But it would be not a, I don't think you could qualify this as a primary or principal use of the property because he's still going to maintain the auto service, you know, the auto body collision business.

228
00:21:01,743 --> 00:21:06,145
This is more or less to have, you know, cars available that he's,

229
00:21:07,485 --> 00:21:11,108
fixed, repaired, that would then be available for sale.

230
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:18,935
And, you know, it's not, it's, you know, it's not unusual to have this kind of an arrangement.

231
00:21:19,336 --> 00:21:29,265
And actually, under Chapter 140, Section 58, there is a requirement that any Class II dealership

232
00:21:30,223 --> 00:21:37,626
or car salesmen have access to a repair auto body shop for purposes of making warranty repairs.

233
00:21:37,686 --> 00:21:44,928
So that, you know, in this situation, it sort of all fits together in terms of use.

234
00:21:45,028 --> 00:21:48,389
The class two needs the auto body repair shop.

235
00:21:48,629 --> 00:21:50,010
He has that existing.

236
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:53,451
It was previously back in the day a dealership.

237
00:21:53,491 --> 00:21:58,172
I'm not arguing that that is a continuing pre-existing use because clearly that was abandoned.

238
00:22:00,351 --> 00:22:06,192
But yeah, I mean, this would be an extension or change of the existing views.

239
00:22:09,313 --> 00:22:09,673
Thank you.

240
00:22:11,593 --> 00:22:12,393
Mike, you've got your hand up.

241
00:22:13,673 --> 00:22:17,454
Yeah, Jamie, just to start up a point of order.

242
00:22:17,634 --> 00:22:28,356
So at the last hearing, I believe there were five members present, yourself, Yvette,

243
00:22:29,928 --> 00:22:33,111
Mary, Chris, and Jim Tarani.

244
00:22:33,131 --> 00:22:35,513
And I think Andre and I were absent.

245
00:22:37,674 --> 00:22:41,778
So there's four of you present right now.

246
00:22:41,798 --> 00:22:44,560
I know I watched the recording.

247
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,982
I don't know, Andre, if you have or haven't.

248
00:22:47,042 --> 00:22:50,585
But I just want to double check who's voting on this.

249
00:22:54,028 --> 00:22:58,772
OK, so Yvette, myself, Mary,

250
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:18,359
And Chris, so I guess, and Jim is not here, so we will mean, I guess, so Mike, can you be the fifth?

251
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:21,020
Sure, yeah, so I'll just publicly attest.

252
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:25,362
I have viewed the recording, so.

253
00:23:26,683 --> 00:23:27,043
Commissioner?

254
00:23:29,011 --> 00:23:42,581
I would suggest that, Mike, just as a technical thing, you sign the actual Mullins affidavit to put into the file to show not just your attestation, but it's legally allowed to vote on this option.

255
00:23:43,842 --> 00:23:44,402
I will do so.

256
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:45,243
Thank you.

257
00:23:48,065 --> 00:23:48,665
Thank you, Commissioner.

258
00:23:49,186 --> 00:23:54,469
Jamie, I also had just something in general to say, if I may.

259
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:54,810
Yep.

260
00:23:55,425 --> 00:23:56,905
Okay, great.

261
00:23:57,586 --> 00:24:11,089
So my understanding is that in the Medford zoning ordinance, there are two distinctly different uses at play here.

262
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:17,711
So there's the auto repair shop and there's a class two auto sales.

263
00:24:18,972 --> 00:24:23,673
So I think whether a use variance is required boils down to

264
00:24:25,736 --> 00:24:26,798
the powers test.

265
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:40,055
So would changing this non-conforming auto repair use reflect a different nature and purpose of the non-conforming use?

266
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:42,258
Whether that

267
00:24:43,345 --> 00:24:55,071
change would result in a difference in the quality, character, or degree of the resulting use, or if the resulting use is different in kind in its effect on the neighborhood.

268
00:24:55,432 --> 00:25:05,077
So essentially, if it triggers any one of those, then my position is that a use variance would be required.

269
00:25:05,177 --> 00:25:10,540
But if the answer is no to all three, then it would not be required.

270
00:25:12,725 --> 00:25:41,855
If I could address that, so in terms of the powers test, my understanding of the powers test is if there's no change in character, and we kind of went through this on the scrub-a-dub case, if there's no, under the powers test, essentially the question becomes whether or not you are entitled as a right to maintain as a continued use

271
00:25:42,672 --> 00:25:46,615
pre-existing non-conforming use or whether you need a finding.

272
00:25:47,296 --> 00:26:10,434
And there's also another layer on that because you have the Section 48, Section 6, which is the floor essentially for a determination as to whether or not you're in compliance with the pre-existing non-conforming requirements.

273
00:26:11,416 --> 00:26:34,938
And then on top of that, you have the Bellotta case, which indicates that that's a floor, but that you can certainly be more permissive in your allowance of variations from the preexisting nonconforming uses, which is what Tickum refers to in talks in terms of if your ordinance allows you to,

274
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:50,171
to allow substitution or change of non-conforming uses, then you still have to make a finding and a special permit still has to issue, but it's not a variant standard.

275
00:26:50,611 --> 00:27:02,058
And I would argue that based on the fact that under 5.2.1 of the ordinance, it indicates in fact that a use variance shall not be required specifically if there's a finding then.

276
00:27:03,837 --> 00:27:06,239
I would argue that a special permit is allowable.

277
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:09,001
Certainly that's within the board's purview to decide.

278
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:18,888
But I think the powers test as a threshold indicates whether or not you have to go to the next step for a finding.

279
00:27:19,869 --> 00:27:27,415
And then if it's a section six and you don't have a permissive ordinance or bylaw, then you're correct.

280
00:27:27,895 --> 00:27:31,338
Then that would be a requirement where you needed to actually have

281
00:27:32,114 --> 00:28:01,018
use variance because it would have it would have to conform but if you're if your ordinance goes beyond that and indicates that it's permissive as a special permit and and I again I would argue in this case where specifically indicates that no use variance is required then I think the board is within its with its purview to issue a special permit but again that that's the voice decision and this isn't an easy area of the law to

282
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:04,320
to navigate, certainly.

283
00:28:05,301 --> 00:28:10,185
I spent the last two weeks looking at it.

284
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:11,986
Mike, you had a question.

285
00:28:12,627 --> 00:28:30,922
Yeah, so just piling on to what Attorney Desmond said, so yes, my understanding is that if the powers test triggers, that just means that additional relief is required, or if it doesn't, then no,

286
00:28:32,283 --> 00:28:33,805
special relief is required.

287
00:28:35,386 --> 00:28:53,722
And so just to clarify my earlier statement, for me, because this is an addition of a use, and it's also an accessory use, which isn't allowed at all as an accessory use under the ordinance,

288
00:28:56,932 --> 00:29:09,041
My read is that unless the power test didn't satisfy any of the criteria, that some relief would be required.

289
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:17,066
And my position is that relief would be a use variance because it's a new use, not just a change in use.

290
00:29:18,087 --> 00:29:20,469
Anyway, just wanted to clarify that.

291
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:32,598
Okay, so I guess the point we're at now is this is change an extension or an accessory use.

292
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:37,664
And

293
00:29:40,453 --> 00:29:43,656
And in that regard, just, you know, there are additions always.

294
00:29:43,856 --> 00:29:48,962
The Tickham case is an addition of a Dunkin' Donuts to what was in existing use.

295
00:29:49,642 --> 00:29:54,848
So, you know, always in these cases, you have additions.

296
00:29:55,228 --> 00:30:01,695
So when I was referring to it as accessory, and I think the fact that it's not listed as not allowed or allowed, you know, doesn't mean it.

297
00:30:02,074 --> 00:30:13,720
It's prohibited necessarily either, but it is an addition, but I don't think that necessarily takes it out of the extension of a pre-existing non-conforming use.

298
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:22,064
Because again, in the Tickham case, there was an addition of a Dunkin' Donuts to the mix in that particular case.

299
00:30:30,616 --> 00:30:39,798
So I'm trying to understand the distinction between selling of services versus selling of a product.

300
00:30:40,678 --> 00:30:41,998
Are they the same use?

301
00:30:42,078 --> 00:30:43,239
Are they different use?

302
00:30:44,179 --> 00:30:46,939
On the one hand, we're talking about just selling services.

303
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,080
On the other hand, there's a product.

304
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:54,061
So can you clarify that, Attorney Desmond?

305
00:30:55,828 --> 00:30:58,430
Well, it kind of all comes down to cars.

306
00:30:59,271 --> 00:31:06,356
So I guess, yeah, it's two separate functions, in essence.

307
00:31:06,937 --> 00:31:11,180
One's repairing and restoring, and the other is selling.

308
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:14,742
So it is two separate functions, certainly.

309
00:31:14,843 --> 00:31:21,207
But they're interrelated in the sense that in order to have a Class 2 license and to operate

310
00:31:22,148 --> 00:31:38,092
a class two uh cars car dealership uh for lack of a better word you have to under the statute under chapter 140 section 58 have the ability to have your warranty repairs um performed so you have to have

311
00:31:38,767 --> 00:31:45,291
access to a repair facility in order to qualify for the class two license.

312
00:31:45,851 --> 00:31:54,176
So they are interrelated in that sense and that you have to have the ability to have both in order to have the class two license follow up.

313
00:31:54,216 --> 00:32:03,262
So in other words, if it was in a situation where you just had a straight, you had a parcel of land and you were going to open a class two dealership, you would have to have

314
00:32:03,743 --> 00:32:12,430
some association with a repair shop in order to meet the requirements under Class 2 to make warranty repairs.

315
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:20,997
So, in that sense, where this parcel brings both together, they're interrelated, the two uses.

316
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,040
Commissioner?

317
00:32:25,492 --> 00:32:28,795
I did want to make a couple of clarifications just for sake.

318
00:32:29,635 --> 00:32:33,278
There are three classes of licensing for automobiles.

319
00:32:33,338 --> 00:32:40,084
Class one is basically new, class two is basically used, and class three is basically a junkyard.

320
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,865
You're selling the parts from the car.

321
00:32:43,106 --> 00:32:50,132
The uses we're talking about are on section H of the use table, which has seven different uses to it.

322
00:32:50,853 --> 00:32:57,176
I believe that the existing repair station will be number two in motor vehicle repair establishment.

323
00:32:57,756 --> 00:33:04,179
And what they're looking to do in the parking lot would be number six, which is class to use motor vehicle sales.

324
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:12,743
So we're talking about the distinction between those two and whether or not that is an extension or change within your purview and jurisdiction.

325
00:33:15,545 --> 00:33:15,825
That's all.

326
00:33:24,017 --> 00:33:27,759
And from a licensing perspective, that falls to the city council, not the zoning board.

327
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:36,244
Right, and that would be a second step that would have to be taken, but this has to happen first, because you have to have a place before you can obtain a license.

328
00:33:37,184 --> 00:33:37,364
Yes.

329
00:33:37,564 --> 00:33:48,250
And I think that's what has me leaning towards a variance, because even in the previous, in the case you referenced, that the zoning board was the licensing board for that.

330
00:33:53,588 --> 00:33:57,811
Right, but they're two separate and distinct issues.

331
00:33:57,892 --> 00:34:15,406
The licensing to obtain the license, which is personal to the, to the party seeking it versus the, you know, the special permit for the, well, the special permit can be personal to the person.

332
00:34:15,466 --> 00:34:19,429
It can certainly be conditioned in that sense, but it runs with the land versus

333
00:34:21,791 --> 00:34:29,295
versus the license which runs to the person and that ability, that person's ability, you know, the bonding and all those issues that come into it.

334
00:34:29,315 --> 00:34:38,740
So it's not, it's more about the person and whether they're worthy of the license itself to sell the vehicles.

335
00:34:39,061 --> 00:34:46,104
So it's an examination of the business and the business and the, you know, there's a bonding requirement and all of that.

336
00:34:46,124 --> 00:34:50,627
It's not related to the use of the land.

337
00:34:53,435 --> 00:34:53,655
Mike.

338
00:34:54,916 --> 00:34:59,179
Yeah, I have a question for Attorney Desmond through the chair.

339
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:05,963
So in the ordinance for primary uses, let's just keep it simple.

340
00:35:07,224 --> 00:35:18,631
The good point that it's not expressly permitted or disallowed as an accessory use, but for primary uses in this district, it states that the

341
00:35:20,552 --> 00:35:27,919
A special permit granting authority for that primary use in this district is city council.

342
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:34,906
So, and it sounds like they're also the body that issues the license.

343
00:35:35,707 --> 00:35:37,009
So, if this were just.

344
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:44,724
starting over, you know, just like a vacant lot that was completely conforming, what would your process be?

345
00:35:44,764 --> 00:35:51,209
Wouldn't you just go before city council and they would weigh in on the use and the license?

346
00:35:52,470 --> 00:36:03,438
I think, Mike, that what you're looking at, there's a typo maybe in the use, because in C1, and I had to change it in mine,

347
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:14,623
In C1, it's not a permitted use as a principal use to Class 2, but it might have C1 next to it.

348
00:36:14,643 --> 00:36:20,664
There might be two C1s, because the only special permit use that's permitted is the new vehicle.

349
00:36:25,928 --> 00:36:34,473
but it's not, so it's not a city council, because it would still have to come before the ZBA if it was new and there was no preexisting use as a use variance.

350
00:36:35,854 --> 00:36:42,178
But I think there is a C1 is printed twice possibly on it, because I know at one point.

351
00:36:43,098 --> 00:36:48,141
Yeah, so I'm referring to MuniCode, the MuniCode version.

352
00:36:48,161 --> 00:36:53,024
I'm just scrolling down.

353
00:36:56,667 --> 00:37:10,871
Class 2 motor vehicle sales, item H6, that on Muni code says, oh, it's C2.

354
00:37:10,931 --> 00:37:11,351
I see.

355
00:37:11,411 --> 00:37:13,672
So this is a C1 district.

356
00:37:14,152 --> 00:37:14,432
Right.

357
00:37:14,933 --> 00:37:15,853
OK, my mistake.

358
00:37:20,474 --> 00:37:25,176
Well, Jamie, yeah, it would be variance no matter what from us.

359
00:37:29,858 --> 00:37:30,058
Okay.

360
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:37,344
That's, yeah, I was scrolling up and down that chart trying to figure out what that column was.

361
00:37:40,486 --> 00:37:42,228
Okay.

362
00:37:43,308 --> 00:37:44,549
So, Commissioner?

363
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:55,298
I will take your recommendation that as we're currently working on redoing the zoning, we will probably want to redo that table so we have the headings at the top of each page.

364
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:00,022
And since we have Alicia on board that will pass it along.

365
00:38:02,303 --> 00:38:09,326
But I'll just interject that it's actually how Unicode uploaded it, not how the city provided it.

366
00:38:09,646 --> 00:38:10,786
Sorry about those headaches.

367
00:38:13,848 --> 00:38:14,488
Thank you, Alicia.

368
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:20,751
OK, so we are in a use variance.

369
00:38:23,116 --> 00:38:34,485
So in terms of the use variance, you've got a parcel which is over 30,000 square feet, 31,000 square feet in area.

370
00:38:35,125 --> 00:38:37,147
It is unusually shaped.

371
00:38:37,307 --> 00:38:49,316
The lot runs from here and comes out to like an upside down T or an L. In addition to that, you have a substantial

372
00:38:50,166 --> 00:39:10,161
building which runs long and narrow which runs the length of the the first part they're probably two-thirds of the the existing parcel repair shop as I think we've talked about in in in some details is is

373
00:39:10,838 --> 00:39:22,142
and the shape of the lot and the ability to have area where you have working space for the repair shop to maintain vehicles that need to be repaired, have been repaired or being appraised.

374
00:39:22,162 --> 00:39:31,144
You also have additional space which could afford the use for a small number of accessory vehicles for sale.

375
00:39:32,305 --> 00:39:39,887
You know, it allows for a unique situation in the sense that you have a building which allows you to facilitate

376
00:39:40,722 --> 00:39:59,866
the repairs that are necessary under 140 section section 58 and you know in the hardship here is certainly that you have all of that in place you have the the repair building you have the area

377
00:40:00,494 --> 00:40:03,715
And it creates a hardship because this is what it does.

378
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:14,318
And there's obviously vehicles that he repairs that could be placed for sale to customers and to those in the area.

379
00:40:15,118 --> 00:40:20,660
In terms of derogation from the bylaw, you're working from what is already a pre-existing

380
00:40:21,201 --> 00:40:40,826
non-conforming lot so in terms of derogation it has to be substantial and you're not this this additional use isn't going to substantially change of the the workings of what is existing as I said before this there's no intent for any signage there's no intent for any additional

381
00:40:41,525 --> 00:40:46,106
employees, um, there's no intent to change the hours.

382
00:40:46,166 --> 00:40:52,968
Essentially, uh, this is what it has always been, um, an eight to five, uh, business Monday through Friday.

383
00:40:53,008 --> 00:40:58,009
So that still would be no weekend, um, weekend use.

384
00:40:58,209 --> 00:41:10,412
And, and in terms of public good, um, you know, I think in the record that we provided at this meeting, and I don't think there's been any opposition, at least that I'm aware of at this point, uh, there were a number of, of neighbors,

385
00:41:11,057 --> 00:41:28,770
who were supportive of this endeavor and thought it would be helpful to those surrounding in the community who actually rely on Mr. Agassi for repairs.

386
00:41:29,231 --> 00:41:37,417
I think one of the things that we always get told and sometimes we don't do is when you buy a car to take it to your mechanic and have him check it out,

387
00:41:37,922 --> 00:41:40,304
you know, before you go and purchase it.

388
00:41:40,384 --> 00:41:48,270
I mean, this is a situation where you have your mechanic and you can buy a vehicle from a mechanic that you trust and that you work with.

389
00:41:49,451 --> 00:41:55,996
And I think, as I indicated last time, he has five stars, which I don't think I've ever seen when it comes to a repair shop.

390
00:41:56,096 --> 00:42:06,084
And the letters of support certainly indicate that he's, you know, an asset to the surrounding area in the community in terms of repairing vehicles.

391
00:42:06,144 --> 00:42:06,905
So in terms of

392
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:08,990
substantial derogation.

393
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:22,533
And in terms of public good, you know, I think that this is a situation where you're offering vehicles that are reasonably priced, um, that, you know, would be available that are, that are not 20 or $30,000.

394
00:42:22,833 --> 00:42:36,275
Um, it also provides customers that have lost their vehicle as, as part of an insurance claim been total loss that scrambling for vehicles that there's, you know, vehicles ready to, to look at and, and possibly purchase, um,

395
00:42:37,378 --> 00:42:39,338
for use in the immediate term.

396
00:42:40,779 --> 00:42:56,741
And, you know, so I think the shape of the lot, the existing building, the shape, and also what the function of it is as a repair shop, which is required, again, under the requirement for a Class II license.

397
00:42:57,222 --> 00:43:00,022
Derogation, again, this is a preexisting nonconforming use.

398
00:43:00,042 --> 00:43:05,623
I'd argue it would be special permit, but even if that's not the case, the derogation from the bylaw isn't

399
00:43:06,151 --> 00:43:21,285
isn't going to change substantially from, from what it is existing, um, where there aren't going to be a number of cars only in, in, in very comfortable in terms of conditions and limiting, um, what, what is permitted in this instance, certainly.

400
00:43:21,305 --> 00:43:28,071
Um, but the traffic, there wouldn't be any, you know, increased traffic necessarily in this, because you're not going to have signage.

401
00:43:28,091 --> 00:43:31,895
You're not going to have any call of attention to, um,

402
00:43:32,605 --> 00:43:33,045
the use.

403
00:43:33,105 --> 00:43:34,467
Essentially, it's internet sales.

404
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:43,114
If somebody sees it or customers who come in and who are in need of a vehicle, um, you know that that's the intent of the use.

405
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:49,500
Thank you.

406
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,241
Attorney guys.

407
00:43:50,601 --> 00:43:58,368
Um, from the board, uh, before we go to, um public comment, any question, any additional follow up from the board?

408
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:06,639
Chris, go ahead.

409
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:09,981
Thank you, Mr. Chair.

410
00:44:10,281 --> 00:44:21,047
It's a general question, I suppose, to other board members and perhaps to the planning director as well.

411
00:44:21,067 --> 00:44:30,252
If there's any institutional knowledge of these sorts of things happening where one business

412
00:44:31,482 --> 00:44:35,125
besides to expand into another area.

413
00:44:35,605 --> 00:44:54,399
I seem to recall from listening to city and attending city council meetings over the years that there have been a few of these sorts of special permits and I suppose variances as well granted

414
00:44:57,555 --> 00:45:11,026
I can't recall specific instances or businesses, but I do seem to recall that there have been similar businesses doing this sort of thing.

415
00:45:11,046 --> 00:45:13,668
Does anyone recall that?

416
00:45:13,968 --> 00:45:16,009
And that's the first part.

417
00:45:16,129 --> 00:45:23,675
And the second part is, I suppose, to the building commissioner, through you, Mr. Chair, who keeps track of

418
00:45:27,017 --> 00:45:37,781
For instance, in this case, the number of cars for sale in the lot, being told it's a certain amount.

419
00:45:38,521 --> 00:45:43,002
And how is that tracked?

420
00:45:43,623 --> 00:45:43,943
Thank you.

421
00:45:50,725 --> 00:45:51,625
Thank you, Chris.

422
00:45:51,885 --> 00:45:55,547
Commissioner, can you speak to the inspectional aspect of that?

423
00:45:57,199 --> 00:46:06,245
Well, since it really doesn't fall under the building code or in the ordinances we normally enforce, I'm not aware that we keep track of it in any way.

424
00:46:07,766 --> 00:46:20,375
Typically, what I see is the city council, if it's under their jurisdiction, issue the license, may from time to time ask a department to go investigate it, maybe police in this case, but we don't track it.

425
00:46:27,427 --> 00:46:27,727
Thank you.

426
00:46:29,168 --> 00:46:29,628
Mike, go ahead.

427
00:46:33,111 --> 00:46:33,891
Yeah.

428
00:46:34,511 --> 00:46:47,840
So in the worksheet itself, the request is for the ability to sell no more than nine vehicles.

429
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:52,963
So I just want to double check with Attorney Desmond if

430
00:46:55,438 --> 00:47:05,124
if that's a condition that the applicant would be comfortable having on any variance here, a limit on the number of vehicles.

431
00:47:05,144 --> 00:47:20,855
I ask because the zoning code for Medford is silent on this accessory use, and at least in my head, an accessory use should have a limit before it becomes a primary use, essentially.

432
00:47:23,417 --> 00:47:29,178
Yes, the applicant is comfortable with that as a condition.

433
00:47:30,058 --> 00:47:41,161
I think in my presentation, and Mr. Abbasi is on the call, but I think he said it's more likely that at any given time it would be more in the vicinity of six as opposed to nine.

434
00:47:41,221 --> 00:47:46,282
So nine being the outer number, but certainly no more than that.

435
00:47:54,447 --> 00:48:04,753
Any other questions from the board?

436
00:48:04,913 --> 00:48:07,855
I think I need some clarification.

437
00:48:08,536 --> 00:48:15,120
It sounds like this particular request requires the city council's approval.

438
00:48:18,638 --> 00:48:30,365
So for this, Mary, the business license requires the City Council approval, but they cannot move forward with requesting that license without having a use variance from us.

439
00:48:32,987 --> 00:48:33,627
Okay, thank you.

440
00:48:35,868 --> 00:48:36,469
Now, Commissioner?

441
00:48:37,529 --> 00:48:39,450
I guess I did want to clarify slightly.

442
00:48:40,611 --> 00:48:41,832
If someone is getting a

443
00:48:42,571 --> 00:48:51,853
class two dealers license to the city council, any restrictions on the number of cars would be placed by them, who their enforcing agent is typically the police.

444
00:48:52,413 --> 00:49:02,576
In this case, if you put a condition on it as a matter of zoning, then I become the enforcing agent for that in the event of a complaint, because it's a zoning issue.

445
00:49:03,016 --> 00:49:10,638
So you can decide to put a condition on it, or you could leave that up to city council, just depends on which way you wanna go.

446
00:49:14,963 --> 00:49:15,564
and Director Hunt.

447
00:49:19,407 --> 00:49:29,876
I was debating whether I should sort of say anything on this case at all, partially because I am familiar with the applicant services.

448
00:49:31,017 --> 00:49:37,283
But as a Medford resident, I am familiar with many businesses and their services in the city.

449
00:49:37,343 --> 00:49:38,524
It goes without saying.

450
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:45,223
We haven't had anything like this in the past four years since I've been the planning director.

451
00:49:46,224 --> 00:50:00,914
And I will say that there was a lesser, how laws and zoning, et cetera, were applied and managed in the city really did change in 2020.

452
00:50:01,014 --> 00:50:02,615
Things perhaps were not as

453
00:50:05,797 --> 00:50:14,619
as strict about going through all the correct hoops at all the right times as they have been since this administration took over in 2020.

454
00:50:14,819 --> 00:50:19,080
So I just wanted to share that from a planning perspective.

455
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:21,541
We don't have any objections to this.

456
00:50:21,681 --> 00:50:23,181
We really were.

457
00:50:23,361 --> 00:50:27,082
I am familiar with the business, how it works next to the brewery next door.

458
00:50:28,562 --> 00:50:34,544
And with the idea that he would not be having vehicles out front with signs on them saying for sale.

459
00:50:37,425 --> 00:50:38,726
I understand how that would work.

460
00:50:39,887 --> 00:50:47,973
And it doesn't seem like it would be a detriment to the neighborhood because people would not really be coming there to buy vehicles.

461
00:50:49,053 --> 00:50:55,298
It would be like, as he describes an accessory, I will say that if somebody is familiar with the business, I believe him.

462
00:50:55,758 --> 00:50:56,819
That's it all helpful.

463
00:50:57,499 --> 00:50:57,719
So.

464
00:50:57,739 --> 00:51:01,262
Thank you, director.

465
00:51:07,044 --> 00:51:13,886
Okay, seeing no other hands raised from the board, Chair awaits a motion to open public comment.

466
00:51:19,027 --> 00:51:21,347
I'll motion to open public comment.

467
00:51:23,688 --> 00:51:24,348
Do we have a second?

468
00:51:27,348 --> 00:51:27,749
Second.

469
00:51:29,129 --> 00:51:29,569
Thank you, Mary.

470
00:51:31,409 --> 00:51:32,209
Roll call vote.

471
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:33,570
Mary?

472
00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:34,570
Aye.

473
00:51:38,002 --> 00:51:41,343
Andrew, you are not voting for this one, correct?

474
00:51:41,703 --> 00:51:42,783
Right, I'm at- Christy Evita?

475
00:51:44,424 --> 00:51:44,984
Yes, aye.

476
00:51:45,004 --> 00:51:47,205
Yvette Pelez?

477
00:51:48,505 --> 00:51:48,645
Aye.

478
00:51:49,825 --> 00:51:50,506
And Mike Caldera?

479
00:51:51,266 --> 00:51:51,406
Aye.

480
00:51:52,706 --> 00:51:53,766
And Jamie Thompson, aye.

481
00:51:54,187 --> 00:51:55,847
All right, we're open for public comment.

482
00:51:56,687 --> 00:52:00,008
Anybody from the public here to speak for 38 Harvard Ave?

483
00:52:01,088 --> 00:52:06,070
If anybody wants to submit via email, email,

484
00:52:07,693 --> 00:52:09,675
Dennis at DMACDougall.

485
00:52:13,037 --> 00:52:18,001
Actually, Dennis, could you just read off your email and put it in the chat?

486
00:52:25,607 --> 00:52:25,907
Thank you.

487
00:52:30,070 --> 00:52:33,933
And that's DMACDougall at Medford-MA.gov.

488
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:50,560
We don't have anyone in the meeting Dennis do you have anything.

489
00:52:50,580 --> 00:53:01,427
No nothing come through regarding this.

490
00:53:02,127 --> 00:53:04,228
Chair with a motion to close public comment.

491
00:53:05,269 --> 00:53:07,230
A motion to close.

492
00:53:07,290 --> 00:53:09,351
The public portion of the hearing and the operation.

493
00:53:09,371 --> 00:53:11,452
Thank you.

494
00:53:11,833 --> 00:53:13,894
Thank you Chris.

495
00:53:18,953 --> 00:53:19,554
Michael there.

496
00:53:22,337 --> 00:53:36,432
Mary I. And I we're now in deliberation and open up to anybody from the board.

497
00:53:39,852 --> 00:53:42,194
I think we covered a lot during the question period.

498
00:53:42,795 --> 00:53:43,395
Go ahead, Mary.

499
00:53:43,916 --> 00:53:50,542
So I thought I heard the word investigation during the first portion of this.

500
00:53:51,683 --> 00:53:54,726
Can someone clarify that, what the investigation involves?

501
00:53:58,309 --> 00:54:02,773
I think someone mentioned about applications like this involve some type of investigation.

502
00:54:07,158 --> 00:54:13,766
They do not, if you're referring to the initial meeting, there was a. I think it was mentioned today.

503
00:54:13,806 --> 00:54:15,848
The word was mentioned today.

504
00:54:15,868 --> 00:54:16,569
So, I just maybe I'm.

505
00:54:22,949 --> 00:54:37,714
It's not uncommon in a class one, two or three application through the business licensing entity, the city council, that they need to get approval letter from the police department and things like that.

506
00:54:37,794 --> 00:54:45,517
So that may be the sense of investigation that is referenced more on that and not necessarily on the zoning end.

507
00:54:49,378 --> 00:54:49,718
Thank you.

508
00:54:56,713 --> 00:55:25,100
Okay, so keeping in mind, we do need to discuss this as a use variance, so that would require us to consider, one, the circumstances relating to the soil condition, shape, topography of the land and structures, where literal enforcement of the provisions of the Ordinance of By-law would involve hardships, financial or otherwise, to the petitioner, and two, that the desirable relief may be granted without substantial detriment to the public good,

509
00:55:25,724 --> 00:55:30,390
and without nullifying or substantially derogating from the intent or purpose of the ordinance or bylaw.

510
00:55:34,395 --> 00:55:38,040
I guess for the board, any other input other than what we've already discussed?

511
00:55:39,758 --> 00:55:54,943
Okay, so a question that came to my mind is that the license itself is for nine cars, and the applicant made some assurances that it will be no more than six or six.

512
00:55:56,123 --> 00:56:04,546
But are there any enforcement mechanisms built into this type of a decision?

513
00:56:06,302 --> 00:56:07,663
How is that being monitored?

514
00:56:07,683 --> 00:56:20,351
I mean, what if, you know, someone just changed that after the permission is granted from six to nine or placing signs all over the, you know.

515
00:56:24,293 --> 00:56:30,077
So the licensing would be fall under the city council, the commissioner mentioned that would be

516
00:56:31,077 --> 00:56:43,992
more than likely enforcement via the police through either an awareness made to the city council or the city about a violation or a concern of the business from somebody from the public or from the city about the business.

517
00:56:44,012 --> 00:56:49,238
All right, thank you.

518
00:56:53,975 --> 00:57:02,219
I think, Mary, what you were trying to say was, I think this is what I'm understanding you to say was, like, who's going to be counting the cars periodically, right?

519
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:21,870
And I think the answer to that is probably nobody, unless the neighbors were to notice it, and then they would then report it to whichever, you know, whether it's the council or if it was the commissioner, you know, that things were not being followed.

520
00:57:23,405 --> 00:57:25,866
At least that's how I understood your question, but.

521
00:57:26,866 --> 00:57:33,488
Yeah, I'm just wondering if this decision how.

522
00:57:35,208 --> 00:57:52,253
Having the number of specific cars or having having or not having these big advertisements through our, even though the representation was made during this presentation, but post the decision, how would that.

523
00:57:54,212 --> 00:57:56,213
Yeah, monitor that's exactly what I was saying.

524
00:57:56,253 --> 00:57:56,994
So, thank you that.

525
00:57:58,795 --> 00:58:08,380
Continuously, and and I understand that certain components will be granted by the city council through the insurance of license, but, but that.

526
00:58:09,581 --> 00:58:12,462
It sounded to me like this, it's a 2 separate.

527
00:58:13,063 --> 00:58:16,805
Application process to to 2 different.

528
00:58:17,185 --> 00:58:21,868
Bodies and 1 is not crossing over.

529
00:58:23,172 --> 00:58:25,293
with the functions of the others.

530
00:58:26,914 --> 00:58:46,325
And it just seems to me that there's that question about what if arbitrarily that the applicant decided to increase that number to nine, the number of cars to nine versus what is represented today as six.

531
00:58:48,228 --> 00:59:02,440
Yeah, I mean, I suppose we could make that recommendation that the city council does that in their review for the license if we don't want to put that in ours to give it over to the commissioner to enforce.

532
00:59:03,361 --> 00:59:08,686
And then at least that's what I would understand it.

533
00:59:08,786 --> 00:59:13,069
And correct me anybody if I'm not understanding that.

534
00:59:15,850 --> 00:59:17,532
Um, I believe that's correct.

535
00:59:17,592 --> 00:59:28,540
Uh, director hunt as part of our vote, if we move this forward, can we notify the city council of what we're looking for for a limit based on the application?

536
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:30,802
I believe the application as Mike pointed out was nine.

537
00:59:33,262 --> 00:59:44,647
Yeah, it seems to me that it's always within the purview of this board to send a memo or a letter of recommendation to another board, including the city council.

538
00:59:45,307 --> 00:59:46,868
There's no reason why you shouldn't.

539
00:59:47,628 --> 00:59:54,251
Honestly, I feel that they would welcome more letters of recommendation from the other boards, so.

540
00:59:54,851 --> 00:59:55,331
Absolutely.

541
00:59:56,912 --> 01:00:01,514
Yeah, it's very similar to Mary and Yvette to what we've seen where other

542
01:00:02,316 --> 01:00:03,297
I think that's a good point.

543
01:00:03,317 --> 01:00:04,138
I think that's a good point.

544
01:00:04,218 --> 01:00:05,039
I think that's a good point.

545
01:00:05,059 --> 01:00:05,759
I think that's a good point.

546
01:00:05,779 --> 01:00:06,360
I think that's a good point.

547
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:07,041
I think that's a good point.

548
01:00:07,061 --> 01:00:08,282
I think that's a good point.

549
01:00:08,302 --> 01:00:12,486
I think that's a good point.

550
01:00:12,506 --> 01:00:13,487
I think that's a good point.

551
01:00:13,507 --> 01:00:16,169
I think that's a good point.

552
01:00:16,189 --> 01:00:16,950
I think that's a good point.

553
01:00:16,970 --> 01:00:18,291
I think that's a good point.

554
01:00:18,311 --> 01:00:20,133
I think that's a good point.

555
01:00:20,153 --> 01:00:22,235
I think that's a good point.

556
01:00:22,255 --> 01:00:24,437
I think that's a good point.

557
01:00:24,457 --> 01:00:25,118
I think that's a good point.

558
01:00:27,302 --> 01:00:39,966
the pairing of these uses and kind of what it does for the business and its customers seems very reasonable and low stakes.

559
01:00:40,046 --> 01:00:44,727
And even the city council has to license it anyway.

560
01:00:44,827 --> 01:00:52,049
So if there was some oversight on our part, I think there's checks in place for that.

561
01:00:53,429 --> 01:00:54,330
When I think about the

562
01:00:55,833 --> 01:00:57,134
intent of the ordinance.

563
01:00:59,636 --> 01:01:08,843
The ordinance says that class 2 motor vehicle sales are not allowed in C1 districts.

564
01:01:09,904 --> 01:01:16,429
And it's silent on whether they are or aren't allowed as an accessory use in any district.

565
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:31,139
I presume the intent of the bylaw, you know, omitting that from the accessory use table was not to, for example, allow class two auto sales as an accessory use in residential districts.

566
01:01:31,239 --> 01:01:44,348
So, you know, I think for me, I would be erring on the side of caution and say if it's omitted from the accessory table, you know, probably the right thing to consult is what's allowed

567
01:01:45,425 --> 01:01:51,172
in the primary use table and here it's not allowed in C1 districts.

568
01:01:51,513 --> 01:02:03,648
So I think for me the intent is that this is not an allowed use in this district and maybe that will change with some of the zoning updates, but that's the part that

569
01:02:05,065 --> 01:02:10,706
would concern me here, even though it seems like a modest introduction of this use.

570
01:02:10,966 --> 01:02:22,028
It's not allowed in this district, and we would be essentially overriding the zoning ordinance based on the other good aspects of this proposal.

571
01:02:32,490 --> 01:02:32,870
Thank you, Mike.

572
01:02:36,255 --> 01:02:37,236
Anyone else from the board?

573
01:02:40,237 --> 01:02:40,557
Chris?

574
01:02:42,418 --> 01:02:47,501
Yeah, I hear Mike's point quite well.

575
01:02:47,661 --> 01:03:03,869
And I think that's why I sort of asked the question a few minutes ago about similar instances or businesses that have gone through this and whether or not, you know,

576
01:03:05,379 --> 01:03:12,160
applicant knows of such instances or any of the members here.

577
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:22,142
Like I say, I seem to recall that other businesses have done this, but I don't know if any of them were in a C1 district.

578
01:03:25,883 --> 01:03:31,504
And I guess that gives me some pause as well.

579
01:03:32,604 --> 01:03:32,964
I think

580
01:03:35,582 --> 01:03:46,228
that the number, the physical space of this particular proposal is pretty limiting.

581
01:03:47,869 --> 01:04:01,257
So I don't see it necessarily getting out of hand unless one were to start parking cars that are for sale on the local road or something of that nature.

582
01:04:03,387 --> 01:04:05,788
It's a pretty small space.

583
01:04:08,069 --> 01:04:21,015
So that part seems to limit the intrusion, if you will, on the local, the abutting residential neighborhood.

584
01:04:30,665 --> 01:04:33,746
Attorney Desmond, are you providing clarification?

585
01:04:36,067 --> 01:04:41,590
Yes, and I guess also through the Chair to the Community Development Director.

586
01:04:42,210 --> 01:04:51,234
In terms of clarification, under the old ordinance there was frequently substitutions of uses that were not allowed, non-conforming uses.

587
01:04:52,764 --> 01:05:04,286
One that I was involved in, for instance, it didn't come up that frequently, but on the West Fells Way, there was a Chinese restaurant, and now that is a hair salon.

588
01:05:04,766 --> 01:05:10,308
Neither one of them were permitted, as I recall, as a right, because it's a residential, I think it's an SF2 district.

589
01:05:11,468 --> 01:05:17,109
But that was the existing Chinese restaurant, and we went before the board on a substitution of a non-conforming

590
01:05:17,793 --> 01:05:24,277
use and substituted it with the hair salon that is currently in that place.

591
01:05:25,938 --> 01:05:45,770
That's why in terms of the special permit, provisions that are there I think are more permissive than they were previously, but it was even in the old code substitution of non-conforming uses that we frequently utilized where you had an existing use that you were going to substitute

592
01:05:46,976 --> 01:06:07,448
With respect to the director, if there were going to be changes in the ordinance, obviously if the board goes through and votes and the votes is not favorable, then unless there's some change and maybe the change of ordinance would be sufficient, it may very well be, but would be subject to the two year rule in terms of bringing a petition forward.

593
01:06:08,248 --> 01:06:14,452
I don't know if that's anything that's being considered in the new zoning in any manner.

594
01:06:15,852 --> 01:06:17,693
or not that I've seen, I've tried to follow along.

595
01:06:23,456 --> 01:06:24,936
Thank you, Attorney Desmond.

596
01:06:25,157 --> 01:06:25,957
Senior Planner Evan.

597
01:06:28,798 --> 01:06:29,259
Good evening.

598
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:34,641
I just wanted to comment on the substitution of the non-conforming use.

599
01:06:34,681 --> 01:06:42,345
So there is a provision you can change from one non-conforming use to another non-conforming use, but I don't think this would apply because you're not

600
01:06:43,828 --> 01:06:47,411
you're not keeping or you are keeping the auto repair.

601
01:06:48,171 --> 01:06:57,597
So you say you were switching from an auto repair to a used car dealership, then maybe that would apply, but I don't think it would in this case.

602
01:07:02,292 --> 01:07:02,612
Thank you.

603
01:07:03,592 --> 01:07:16,195
Not to belabor the point, but I think under the take-home case where you have an addition, it's still within that change extension that would, but we're kind of past that at this point, we're at the use variance, and I understand that in terms of where we are.

604
01:07:16,215 --> 01:07:20,915
I think we just disagree as to where that goes on the special permit.

605
01:07:25,356 --> 01:07:25,976
And go ahead, Mike.

606
01:07:26,657 --> 01:07:28,637
Yeah, one thing I,

607
01:07:29,980 --> 01:07:38,626
Didn't notice when I was speaking to intent, that's an interesting counterpoint is motor vehicle repair.

608
01:07:38,646 --> 01:07:42,288
It gets the same treatment.

609
01:07:42,348 --> 01:07:51,455
So the primary nonconforming use gets the same treatment in the table of uses as class two motor vehicle sales.

610
01:07:51,475 --> 01:07:54,296
So both are not allowed in a C1.

611
01:07:56,108 --> 01:08:02,273
and require a special permit from the city council in a C2.

612
01:08:03,574 --> 01:08:18,405
So here it would be adding a use that receives not identical but similar treatment in the zoning ordinance to a non-conforming use.

613
01:08:18,425 --> 01:08:21,427
So maybe there's a case to be made for, you know,

614
01:08:23,463 --> 01:08:28,266
the impact of that use is similar or something of that nature.

615
01:08:28,306 --> 01:08:29,887
So I just wanted to point that out as well.

616
01:08:31,828 --> 01:08:37,992
Thank you for calling that out.

617
01:08:38,193 --> 01:08:38,393
Okay.

618
01:08:38,473 --> 01:08:39,133
Anything else?

619
01:08:39,533 --> 01:08:40,414
Anyone else from the board?

620
01:08:44,877 --> 01:08:45,778
I'd comment.

621
01:08:46,838 --> 01:08:47,439
Go ahead.

622
01:08:48,359 --> 01:08:52,162
I would just like to add that I actually think this is

623
01:08:54,463 --> 01:09:07,247
It's I think, because of the restrictive property and what they've already decided, you know, they're so limited to the number of cars and and I don't think anybody could sell cars on the.

624
01:09:08,540 --> 01:09:12,601
Park any of the cars that are being sold in the public spots.

625
01:09:12,641 --> 01:09:14,662
I think neighbors would complain very quickly.

626
01:09:15,502 --> 01:09:19,504
But that street itself is just relatively busy.

627
01:09:20,104 --> 01:09:23,805
And I think this is not detrimental to the neighborhood.

628
01:09:23,825 --> 01:09:26,746
I'm actually really in favor of this.

629
01:09:27,266 --> 01:09:33,088
And while I hear and understand what you are saying, Michael, but I think one of the

630
01:09:33,849 --> 01:09:38,912
Great things about being on the board right is that we can we can look at this in a more.

631
01:09:41,073 --> 01:09:47,157
Public use and way and nobody has none of the neighbors and nobody's come forward to.

632
01:09:48,198 --> 01:09:57,268
Be strongly opposed to this, so I think this would be something that would be a really great asset to the community and.

633
01:09:58,029 --> 01:10:02,013
Obviously, for the business owner, and we want to support our local businesses.

634
01:10:02,093 --> 01:10:02,313
So.

635
01:10:03,835 --> 01:10:06,598
I just like to comment on on that in in that way.

636
01:10:14,267 --> 01:10:17,150
Okay, just my own feedback as well.

637
01:10:18,352 --> 01:10:25,940
Absolutely see that the intent from the applicant is a good value add for the service to his customers.

638
01:10:27,481 --> 01:10:34,729
I feel the placement obviously is not going to be detrimental to the area with vehicles that are already taking up spaces in the back.

639
01:10:35,090 --> 01:10:36,091
They're not going to be in the front.

640
01:10:36,775 --> 01:10:48,925
no signage on the property and I think in some aspects the licensing structure that we have for uses is geared not just with restriction but for competition as well.

641
01:10:51,007 --> 01:10:55,150
You don't want to have multiple car dealerships in the same location.

642
01:10:56,291 --> 01:11:02,016
I don't feel that this is an intent to compete in that market and this is just an added service to existing customer base.

643
01:11:04,450 --> 01:11:19,722
To Mike's point, now that we have a better understanding of the use and the table for service as well as the sales aspect, I think that it gives us an interesting opportunity that the current primary use is already non-conforming.

644
01:11:20,142 --> 01:11:26,327
And this is, as we've talked about, an accessory, not detrimental to the area.

645
01:11:28,398 --> 01:11:41,710
The one aspect of the variance that I was struggled with, and I think Mike gave us a good piece of information to take into consideration, was the substantial hardship or derogation from the zoning ordinance.

646
01:11:42,030 --> 01:11:46,254
I think we, with Mike's point, that became a little bit easier.

647
01:11:48,256 --> 01:11:55,282
So if anybody else does not have anything, I would open the floor to, oh, Mike, go ahead.

648
01:11:56,007 --> 01:11:58,428
Yeah, I should have asked this earlier.

649
01:12:00,389 --> 01:12:06,572
So in the application, it states there would not be anticipated signage of any kind.

650
01:12:07,793 --> 01:12:17,338
Is that something that we would need to impose in the form of a condition if we felt that was an important aspect of the analysis?

651
01:12:17,598 --> 01:12:21,320
Or will the sign ordinances already cover that?

652
01:12:29,650 --> 01:12:32,191
Do you have something else?

653
01:12:33,892 --> 01:12:36,334
I have something else, but I can respond to that.

654
01:12:37,875 --> 01:12:46,701
If you don't condition the prohibition of signage, then whatever is allowed by right, they can just apply for a sign permit.

655
01:12:47,361 --> 01:12:50,724
So we'd have to analyze what they're allowed.

656
01:12:50,744 --> 01:12:53,325
It's a formula.

657
01:12:56,065 --> 01:13:09,720
If it's an appropriate time now, if you're inclined to approve this request, I would offer a condition regarding the frontage along Bower Street.

658
01:13:09,740 --> 01:13:13,425
It's currently a chain link fence with barbed wire and

659
01:13:16,740 --> 01:13:21,921
you can see right into the huge surface parking lot with, you know, it's an auto repair shop.

660
01:13:21,941 --> 01:13:27,402
So it's, you know, it's not real pretty back there with, you know, broken cars and crane and things like that.

661
01:13:27,422 --> 01:13:40,365
I would think that a way to mitigate this non-conforming use and an additional use if not allowed there would be to put a solid fence up without barbed wire.

662
01:13:40,805 --> 01:13:44,526
Any opportunities that we have to remove barbed wire in the city

663
01:13:47,055 --> 01:13:48,336
We like to try to do that.

664
01:13:48,416 --> 01:13:50,378
It's not a dangerous neighborhood.

665
01:13:50,398 --> 01:13:51,999
I don't know why it needs to be there.

666
01:13:54,862 --> 01:13:56,804
But yeah, that's all I have.

667
01:14:00,107 --> 01:14:06,892
I like that, especially for the conditions and obviously not being a detriment to the community.

668
01:14:06,913 --> 01:14:08,594
That would be an improvement as well.

669
01:14:09,755 --> 01:14:11,797
Just have to make sure it's the right height so it doesn't come back here.

670
01:14:17,746 --> 01:14:18,166
All right.

671
01:14:18,246 --> 01:14:33,049
The chair awaits a motion on 38 Harvard Ave.

672
01:14:33,250 --> 01:14:36,410
I missed what you said, Jamie, because I was reading something.

673
01:14:36,450 --> 01:14:38,731
I was trying to pull up the signage stuff.

674
01:14:38,751 --> 01:14:44,332
So you were saying that you think that that is a good condition that we should impose, or you were

675
01:14:46,963 --> 01:14:55,047
I think that's a benefit to the community considering that it seems like we are moving forward.

676
01:14:56,628 --> 01:15:01,471
So I think right now we are looking at conditions.

677
01:15:04,972 --> 01:15:11,936
Can we condition by the fence or would that need to be in our letter to, I think that's us, not the city council.

678
01:15:13,195 --> 01:15:24,436
Yeah, we would, we could, I mean, the applicant, we want to make sure the applicant was okay, but with it, but we, we could impose a condition that the fence be replaced with some parameters.

679
01:15:28,859 --> 01:15:33,440
The only question with that, in confirming with my client, is that he's a lessee, not the landlord.

680
01:15:33,460 --> 01:15:35,841
So he would need to get permission from the landlord.

681
01:15:35,861 --> 01:15:38,002
I don't see that as being an obstacle.

682
01:15:38,022 --> 01:15:41,963
Obviously, if he can't meet the condition, then that's an issue.

683
01:15:42,003 --> 01:15:48,005
But he didn't put the fence in, and he's the applicant as the lessee, not the owner.

684
01:15:48,945 --> 01:15:53,227
So he would have to get permission under his lease agreement to be able to do that.

685
01:15:55,292 --> 01:15:59,075
but certainly the condition is part of the application as an issue.

686
01:16:00,036 --> 01:16:01,918
There's just that one hurdle that he would have.

687
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:13,889
You know, if it means we have to come back to the board, if that's a condition, if there's some kind of change that the landowner wants, I suppose that we could do that if need be.

688
01:16:13,909 --> 01:16:18,973
Okay.

689
01:16:20,615 --> 01:16:21,035
Commissioner.

690
01:16:22,372 --> 01:16:34,131
I will note that in section 94-6.38 of the zoning bylaw, there is a line called unsightly uses areas which says exposed storage areas.

691
01:16:35,612 --> 01:16:42,337
And other ugly, unsightly uses shall be screened from view using plantings, berms, walls, or tight fences.

692
01:16:42,377 --> 01:16:52,844
So if you wanted to cite that as something in accommodation with that, it would get an awful lot of choices to the landlord to find a way to screen it reasonably, whether it's a fence or some other choice.

693
01:16:54,225 --> 01:16:54,765
And that was 94-638?

694
01:16:54,785 --> 01:16:54,765
638.

695
01:16:54,986 --> 01:16:55,126
Yes.

696
01:16:55,146 --> 01:16:55,506
Thank you.

697
01:16:55,526 --> 01:16:56,807
All right.

698
01:17:05,082 --> 01:17:30,580
Motion to approve the accessory use variance to allow the class two auto sales subject to the condition that the rear fence be

699
01:17:31,846 --> 01:17:56,912
or the rear screening be modified to comply with section 6.3.8 of the zoning ordinance and subject to the condition that there shall be no signage on the property advertising this use.

700
01:18:00,010 --> 01:18:09,773
And Mike, can I also add, Mike, can I also add subject to the number of cars that the applicant had represented to six?

701
01:18:11,553 --> 01:18:12,694
We're not including that, Mary.

702
01:18:12,714 --> 01:18:15,374
We're going to send that as a letter to the city council for the license.

703
01:18:15,874 --> 01:18:16,695
Okay, okay.

704
01:18:20,076 --> 01:18:24,697
Right, so that'll... Go ahead, Mike.

705
01:18:24,737 --> 01:18:25,577
That's my motion.

706
01:18:25,617 --> 01:18:28,238
So I motion to approve subject to those two conditions.

707
01:18:30,012 --> 01:18:30,292
Thank you.

708
01:18:30,432 --> 01:18:31,073
Do we have a second?

709
01:18:32,414 --> 01:18:32,694
Second.

710
01:18:34,535 --> 01:18:34,976
Thank you, Mary.

711
01:18:36,557 --> 01:18:37,317
Roll call vote.

712
01:18:38,018 --> 01:18:38,678
Yvette Valez?

713
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:40,780
Aye.

714
01:18:42,821 --> 01:18:43,302
Mary Lee?

715
01:18:45,203 --> 01:18:45,343
Aye.

716
01:18:47,065 --> 01:18:47,665
Kristi Avena?

717
01:18:47,685 --> 01:18:49,146
Aye.

718
01:18:50,427 --> 01:18:51,047
Mike Galvera?

719
01:18:52,849 --> 01:18:52,989
Aye.

720
01:18:54,770 --> 01:18:55,471
Jamie Townsend?

721
01:18:55,691 --> 01:18:55,771
Aye.

722
01:19:00,650 --> 01:19:02,952
Thank you everybody for your patience and work on that one.

723
01:19:04,893 --> 01:19:06,253
Thank you very much, appreciate it.

724
01:19:08,955 --> 01:19:11,336
And Dennis, can we move to the next item?

725
01:19:12,316 --> 01:19:18,280
Sure, just for Attorney Desmond, if we get a draft of the, thank you.

726
01:19:22,902 --> 01:19:25,163
On here is 28 Winford Way, case number A-2024-07.

727
01:19:28,007 --> 01:19:39,009
Applicant and owner, Anthony Monaco, is petitioning for a variance from Chapter 94, City of Medford Zoning, to install a fence over six, excuse me, six feet tall at 28 Winford Way, which is not allowed per the City of Medford Zoned Ordinance, Chapter 94, Sections 4.2.3, 4.2.4, and 4.2.5.

728
01:19:39,109 --> 01:19:41,389
I think do we have a representative from the applicant?

729
01:19:41,449 --> 01:19:41,549
Hmm.

730
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:19,243
doesn't appear we do just see if I can.

731
01:20:20,964 --> 01:20:27,028
If you wish I can give you some background on this issue because it does stem from a formal complaint to us.

732
01:20:33,433 --> 01:20:36,274
without the applicant here.

733
01:20:36,374 --> 01:20:36,594
Mike?

734
01:20:38,155 --> 01:20:44,098
Yeah, I've had an opportunity to review some of the materials submitted, and I'd like to proceed with this hearing.

735
01:20:44,118 --> 01:20:51,642
So if the building commissioner could share some details, I think we have enough info to act on this one.

736
01:20:53,183 --> 01:20:53,423
Okay.

737
01:20:54,203 --> 01:20:57,125
Thank you, Mike.

738
01:20:57,145 --> 01:20:57,725
Commissioner, go ahead.

739
01:20:59,387 --> 01:21:02,249
Uh, yeah, this house was remodeled a year or two ago.

740
01:21:02,849 --> 01:21:08,533
Anthony Monaco, for reference, I believe, was the former president of Tufts, and he put up a wood fence.

741
01:21:08,613 --> 01:21:20,901
It's more of a horizontally oriented fence, put it up at seven feet tall, and a buddy neighbor filed a complaint that it was too tall and has continued to pursue that complaint that it's too tall.

742
01:21:20,941 --> 01:21:23,142
It is seven feet tall, Louis, six feet tall.

743
01:21:24,764 --> 01:21:33,432
We've been encouraging Mr. Monaco to come in and file a variance to clarify this issue once for all and it's taken quite some time to get

744
01:21:34,171 --> 01:21:42,878
to this far in the process, but it is in response to an abutting neighbor's complaint, identified that the fence was taller than allowed by zoning.

745
01:21:43,298 --> 01:21:48,102
For a point of clarification, a seven-foot fence does not require a building permit.

746
01:21:48,122 --> 01:21:55,887
So despite discordance between zoning and building, it was a part of a larger full gut and remodel.

747
01:22:01,131 --> 01:22:01,752
Thank you, Commissioner.

748
01:22:04,222 --> 01:22:16,490
Okay, so what we have on our is a seven-foot fence that does not comply with the ordinance of a six-foot limit.

749
01:22:18,631 --> 01:22:25,055
We do have to evaluate this in this scenario as if the fence were not built.

750
01:22:32,953 --> 01:22:37,477
I see a hand raised, Lisa DeFabritis, are you here for the applicant?

751
01:22:39,399 --> 01:22:45,765
No, I'm the adjacent neighbor to the property.

752
01:22:46,646 --> 01:22:47,547
Okay.

753
01:22:48,467 --> 01:22:50,189
We can have you speak when we open public comment.

754
01:22:50,309 --> 01:22:50,930
Okay, thank you.

755
01:22:51,890 --> 01:22:52,251
Thank you.

756
01:22:52,271 --> 01:22:58,917
I guess any questions from the board for the commissioner?

757
01:23:05,162 --> 01:23:05,362
Mike?

758
01:23:06,302 --> 01:23:19,406
Yeah, I guess I will, kind of in the form of a question to the commissioner, just summarize my understanding to make sure we're not missing anything.

759
01:23:19,466 --> 01:23:24,387
So hold on, I'm just pulling up the application, 28 Windsor.

760
01:23:26,728 --> 01:23:29,268
So, or Winford.

761
01:23:29,288 --> 01:23:29,689
Winford.

762
01:23:33,690 --> 01:23:54,998
OK, so if I understood the zoning worksheet request correctly, the argument is that this property is lower than the neighboring properties.

763
01:23:56,139 --> 01:24:01,221
And this is the unusual aspect about the topography that would warrant

764
01:24:02,344 --> 01:24:02,964
a variance.

765
01:24:03,545 --> 01:24:09,428
So I guess I want to double check my understanding of that with the building commissioner.

766
01:24:09,528 --> 01:24:12,990
And then also, I did look up this property.

767
01:24:13,010 --> 01:24:23,456
I see the topography is unusual, but I didn't see that the property is actually lower than the neighbors and the areas where the fence is beyond the ordinance.

768
01:24:23,496 --> 01:24:27,939
So I wonder if the building commissioner could also speak to that.

769
01:24:28,039 --> 01:24:30,100
Is this a case where the

770
01:24:32,299 --> 01:24:36,640
abutting properties are higher elevation than the fence line.

771
01:24:37,922 --> 01:24:51,825
Um, there is definitely a height difference and noticeably different difficult difference between say the left to the right side and the neighbor is on the right side and the fence says that seven foot is up high towards her property.

772
01:24:52,205 --> 01:24:56,706
It does drop down across the backyard and by the time it gets the opposite side yard.

773
01:24:57,006 --> 01:24:59,107
Yeah, the elevation substantially lower.

774
01:24:59,327 --> 01:25:03,528
They're sort of on their way up a hill up into the Winchester area right there.

775
01:25:04,868 --> 01:25:11,930
But the primary issue of concern is the fence that is right on the property line, which is probably the full height of seven at the neighbor's backyard.

776
01:25:14,630 --> 01:25:15,270
Okay, thank you.

777
01:25:15,290 --> 01:25:16,871
That's my question.

778
01:25:21,271 --> 01:25:22,672
And next, Andre.

779
01:25:23,732 --> 01:25:26,372
Just a follow up to the commissioner.

780
01:25:26,752 --> 01:25:29,493
I'm wondering if you have a recommendation on this matter.

781
01:25:33,340 --> 01:25:43,384
Well, certainly if you choose not to approve this, the fence can be modified in place without substantial work to bring it down.

782
01:25:43,484 --> 01:25:46,145
It's not a chain link fence, it's a wood fence.

783
01:25:47,485 --> 01:25:53,127
They were encouraged, I believe, at one time and talked to the inspector to just go around and cut it one foot short.

784
01:25:54,008 --> 01:25:57,429
They chose instead, I believe, to apply for the variance.

785
01:26:00,836 --> 01:26:19,256
And kind of a nuanced follow up on that is, excuse me, since we haven't seen, you know, walk the perimeter of the property and the topography, would all sides of the fence need to be modified in your opinion?

786
01:26:20,297 --> 01:26:23,300
Technically, all sides of the fence are seven feet tall.

787
01:26:25,134 --> 01:26:25,414
Yes.

788
01:26:26,175 --> 01:26:39,186
Well, and I guess the reason why I asked that is because this board has approved in the past offenses that have been taller when there has been, you know, a topographical difference among the properties.

789
01:26:41,468 --> 01:26:49,355
And so I'm just wondering if it would be, you know, maybe not the entire perimeter would

790
01:26:52,249 --> 01:27:07,541
I guess I will defer the level of complaint to the abutter as to whether or not this is primarily about the section that they share in common, or if it should or is expected to include those that are on the opposite side of the house that maybe she cannot see from her property.

791
01:27:08,461 --> 01:27:16,087
By literal interpretation of the rule, everything has to be six foot, not seven foot, unless you allow some sort of partial exemption.

792
01:27:16,808 --> 01:27:17,128
Right.

793
01:27:17,629 --> 01:27:17,909
Thank you.

794
01:27:24,278 --> 01:27:25,639
Thank you and thank you commissioner.

795
01:27:26,879 --> 01:27:29,460
Any other questions from the board for the commissioner.

796
01:27:37,583 --> 01:27:40,124
Chair awaits a motion to open public comment.

797
01:27:40,964 --> 01:27:42,925
I motion to open public comment.

798
01:27:45,766 --> 01:27:46,786
Second we have a second.

799
01:27:48,867 --> 01:27:49,067
Thank you.

800
01:27:54,720 --> 01:27:55,040
Yes.

801
01:27:56,842 --> 01:27:57,422
Andrea LaRue.

802
01:27:58,143 --> 01:27:58,323
Aye.

803
01:28:00,045 --> 01:28:00,765
Yvette Velez.

804
01:28:01,806 --> 01:28:01,926
Aye.

805
01:28:04,128 --> 01:28:05,169
And Mary Lynn.

806
01:28:10,714 --> 01:28:11,334
Do we lose Mary?

807
01:28:15,538 --> 01:28:15,758
Aye.

808
01:28:16,839 --> 01:28:17,320
Thank you, Mary.

809
01:28:18,060 --> 01:28:19,502
And Jamie Thompson.

810
01:28:19,742 --> 01:28:19,862
Aye.

811
01:28:20,771 --> 01:28:22,532
Okay, we'll open up to public comment.

812
01:28:22,713 --> 01:28:28,036
First hand raised, I see Lisa Deferberti, if I can pronounce it correctly.

813
01:28:28,417 --> 01:28:29,658
Deferberti, yes, thank you.

814
01:28:30,741 --> 01:28:38,546
So yes, I am the neighbor who contacted the city almost a year ago.

815
01:28:38,566 --> 01:28:45,930
And with all due respect, I have images of the fence that I emailed to Dennis this morning.

816
01:28:45,950 --> 01:28:49,352
And that fence is not seven feet tall.

817
01:28:49,872 --> 01:28:51,053
It's like nine feet tall.

818
01:28:51,073 --> 01:28:53,554
So I'm not sure where the seven foot came up.

819
01:28:54,055 --> 01:28:59,198
And I'm happy to throw up a couple of images of the fence if you'll let me share my screen.

820
01:29:00,118 --> 01:29:04,762
And the request, so that's the biggest point.

821
01:29:04,782 --> 01:29:07,564
We're not talking just like six feet, oh, it's a seven foot.

822
01:29:08,304 --> 01:29:13,708
The building department has been involved and has been contacting the owner for almost a year.

823
01:29:14,048 --> 01:29:15,269
They've been sending them letters.

824
01:29:15,329 --> 01:29:16,350
They've been finding them.

825
01:29:16,810 --> 01:29:18,491
They have not been responsive.

826
01:29:18,571 --> 01:29:21,493
The only reason that we're having this hearing today

827
01:29:22,354 --> 01:29:35,306
is because they got a final letter from the building department that if they do not bring the fence down to code, that this will be passed off to the legal department to pursue this matter legally.

828
01:29:35,987 --> 01:29:46,717
So that's the only reason we're here, because for almost a year, they've just ignored every attempt by the city and the building department for them to bring this fence down to code, which is six feet.

829
01:29:47,718 --> 01:29:52,339
And as I mentioned, that fence is not seven feet, it's closer to nine feet.

830
01:29:52,539 --> 01:30:00,001
I have images, I sent it to Dennis this morning, and can share my screen or other.

831
01:30:00,241 --> 01:30:08,844
It looks like, and I've talked to many of my neighbors, I've been living here for 20 years, and the comment that most of my neighbors share is, it looks like a prison wall.

832
01:30:09,644 --> 01:30:10,965
It's an eyesore.

833
01:30:11,085 --> 01:30:15,427
I have a six foot white vinyl fence on my property.

834
01:30:15,447 --> 01:30:22,010
And beside their side, you see this enormous nine foot high wooden fence.

835
01:30:22,631 --> 01:30:26,753
So when I'm in my yard, I see an extra at least three feet of wood, brown wood.

836
01:30:27,613 --> 01:30:29,935
on top of above my white fence.

837
01:30:30,035 --> 01:30:31,115
It's an eyesore.

838
01:30:31,295 --> 01:30:32,816
It's literally an eyesore.

839
01:30:33,297 --> 01:30:37,740
If this didn't affect other residents or other homeowners, I could care less.

840
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:39,100
I wouldn't be here complaining.

841
01:30:39,701 --> 01:30:42,383
But the fact of the matter is, I live next door.

842
01:30:42,403 --> 01:30:45,565
I go out my yard and I see this eyesore.

843
01:30:45,705 --> 01:30:47,566
And I got to look at this every day for the rest of my life.

844
01:30:47,606 --> 01:30:48,867
No, I'm sorry.

845
01:30:49,947 --> 01:30:51,989
And they just do

846
01:30:52,629 --> 01:30:54,611
You know, there's a reason we have codes, right?

847
01:30:54,631 --> 01:30:56,672
To make people follow codes.

848
01:30:56,732 --> 01:30:59,814
If you want to do something exception, you go make a request.

849
01:31:00,155 --> 01:31:03,717
They've already submitted a permit, I guess, a couple of months ago.

850
01:31:03,777 --> 01:31:05,999
The city building department rejected it.

851
01:31:06,519 --> 01:31:08,481
And then they didn't respond.

852
01:31:08,541 --> 01:31:10,182
They were fined continuously.

853
01:31:10,202 --> 01:31:12,884
And now they got this final letter.

854
01:31:12,904 --> 01:31:14,125
And that's why we're here today.

855
01:31:14,625 --> 01:31:24,414
So I'm not sure why the commissioner mentioned that the owner was a prior president of Tufts, because I really don't know what difference, what that has to do with this at all, who the person is.

856
01:31:25,395 --> 01:31:29,759
No one is above the law, as we are famous saying, we say this often.

857
01:31:30,359 --> 01:31:36,004
Everybody has the same rights, and everybody should be following the law and do a following procedure.

858
01:31:36,445 --> 01:31:38,506
No one is any different than anyone else.

859
01:31:38,927 --> 01:31:39,868
And as I mentioned,

860
01:31:41,448 --> 01:31:49,135
It's not just myself, I see my other neighbors, a couple of my other neighbors on this line, and I'm sure they'll be deferring to add their comments.

861
01:31:49,456 --> 01:31:56,562
But as the prior case mentioned, there was no one else on that auto case prior to this conversation that had objections.

862
01:31:57,283 --> 01:32:02,649
I've been injecting for a year and the building department has sided with me to date on this matter.

863
01:32:03,089 --> 01:32:06,333
So it's not like, oh, they didn't need a permit.

864
01:32:06,733 --> 01:32:08,475
So I've been very upset.

865
01:32:08,515 --> 01:32:09,876
I put a lot of time in this.

866
01:32:10,317 --> 01:32:11,838
I've been very unhappy.

867
01:32:12,039 --> 01:32:12,980
My neighbors are too.

868
01:32:13,560 --> 01:32:18,342
I don't understand why, like, as the Commissioner mentioned, it's a very easy cut.

869
01:32:18,702 --> 01:32:25,345
When they purchased this home, the home was, I believe, closer to COLE, six feet.

870
01:32:25,785 --> 01:32:31,268
I believe, from my understanding from another neighbor, they had requested to the contractor to make it higher.

871
01:32:31,288 --> 01:32:34,309
It was them who wanted, supposedly, had it higher.

872
01:32:34,689 --> 01:32:37,290
And additionally, I would just add this last comment.

873
01:32:37,810 --> 01:32:38,471
In the fall,

874
01:32:39,431 --> 01:32:52,314
The owners, after purchasing the house and having that fence high in the back, they had a contractor put a fence all the way down to the street and in front of the property.

875
01:32:52,614 --> 01:32:55,914
And they were doing it the same height of nine feet.

876
01:32:56,375 --> 01:33:06,637
It just so happens one of the building assessors from the building department came by while they were working and saw it and told them, don't even put that up there.

877
01:33:08,677 --> 01:33:09,517
You can't do that.

878
01:33:09,617 --> 01:33:10,698
And they stopped.

879
01:33:10,758 --> 01:33:13,519
They cut it and they put it to code.

880
01:33:14,079 --> 01:33:20,481
So again, my thing is me and my husband and I strongly object to this.

881
01:33:20,541 --> 01:33:21,481
We are not happy.

882
01:33:21,521 --> 01:33:22,662
We have not been happy.

883
01:33:22,682 --> 01:33:24,522
There's a code in place.

884
01:33:24,662 --> 01:33:26,743
It's not seven feet.

885
01:33:26,783 --> 01:33:27,623
It's not six feet.

886
01:33:27,703 --> 01:33:28,944
It's approximately nine feet.

887
01:33:29,344 --> 01:33:40,187
It's a horrible eyesore, not just to me, my neighbors, but even when you walk on the street, because the house is a little bit apart, you can see that enormous wall in the back.

888
01:33:40,247 --> 01:33:44,148
And they even put the fence in the front, but that's their right, and it's up to code.

889
01:33:44,188 --> 01:33:45,489
But again, it's like a prison.

890
01:33:45,569 --> 01:33:48,009
It's just aesthetically ugly.

891
01:33:48,949 --> 01:33:51,150
So I will stop there.

892
01:33:51,270 --> 01:33:51,630
Thank you.

893
01:33:53,831 --> 01:33:54,751
Thank you.

894
01:33:56,712 --> 01:33:57,792
Dennis, do you have the?

895
01:33:58,329 --> 01:34:01,071
pictures that were sent to you that you could share?

896
01:34:05,154 --> 01:34:14,481
Did you get the email that I sent you this morning at the minute?

897
01:34:15,462 --> 01:34:18,704
I thought we had to look at the fences if the fence wasn't built.

898
01:34:21,266 --> 01:34:21,466
Okay.

899
01:34:21,506 --> 01:34:22,287
Yeah, I do have that.

900
01:34:23,868 --> 01:34:24,068
Sorry.

901
01:34:25,737 --> 01:34:25,997
Okay.

902
01:34:26,097 --> 01:34:27,899
I can, if you want, I can call them up though.

903
01:34:27,999 --> 01:34:28,460
I can bring them.

904
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:28,820
Yeah.

905
01:34:28,940 --> 01:34:31,342
It would be helpful for me if we could display them.

906
01:34:31,362 --> 01:34:37,147
I know I've reviewed them this morning, but I would love to see them displayed here for everyone.

907
01:34:39,109 --> 01:34:40,671
But Jamie, did you get the message I sent you?

908
01:34:41,792 --> 01:34:41,952
Yep.

909
01:34:43,233 --> 01:34:43,453
Okay.

910
01:34:44,414 --> 01:34:46,976
Uh, an email or just now?

911
01:34:47,837 --> 01:34:49,839
No, literally just now in the, in the, in the zoom chat.

912
01:34:57,327 --> 01:34:58,888
I can share my screen if that's easier.

913
01:35:00,269 --> 01:35:04,231
Gotcha.

914
01:35:06,392 --> 01:35:09,533
Procedurally, do we need to finish public comment and then can we go back?

915
01:35:11,414 --> 01:35:12,955
That's what I'm not honestly sure about.

916
01:35:12,975 --> 01:35:16,897
I'm trying to figure out.

917
01:35:16,917 --> 01:35:19,999
That's why I'm kind of scrambling a little bit back here.

918
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:24,321
I think we're already in public comment.

919
01:35:24,861 --> 01:35:25,842
Well, the prior

920
01:35:27,877 --> 01:35:33,380
resident offered to show those photos, so I think that's part of her testimony.

921
01:35:34,281 --> 01:35:35,541
No, this is a separate matter.

922
01:35:35,561 --> 01:35:44,547
The applicant's rep is on the line right now, and I guess there was an issue getting on, so I'm just trying to know if we can go back to the applicant's rep now, or do we wait until we finish public comment?

923
01:35:45,027 --> 01:35:45,407
Got it.

924
01:35:51,591 --> 01:35:53,672
I'm happy to share my screen and show the pitches.

925
01:35:56,659 --> 01:36:02,100
I can show them it was sort of another procedural matter that we're trying to figure out.

926
01:36:02,120 --> 01:36:06,582
Thank you.

927
01:36:08,983 --> 01:36:10,603
Can we have them speak as public comment?

928
01:36:13,004 --> 01:36:14,504
I think that would be acceptable.

929
01:36:15,585 --> 01:36:16,845
I think that would probably be the best way to go.

930
01:36:16,905 --> 01:36:17,065
Yes.

931
01:36:26,258 --> 01:36:27,239
Actually, nowhere.

932
01:36:29,441 --> 01:36:37,848
Anybody from the board?

933
01:36:39,330 --> 01:36:41,892
Robert's Rules question of the applicant is now here.

934
01:36:41,912 --> 01:36:49,559
So the question is, can we step back, or do we just allow them to speak as part of public comment?

935
01:36:50,640 --> 01:36:51,280
Point of order.

936
01:36:51,300 --> 01:36:52,662
I think we can.

937
01:36:52,682 --> 01:36:53,182
Thank you, Michael.

938
01:36:53,570 --> 01:36:54,790
I think we could step back.

939
01:36:56,071 --> 01:36:57,431
I don't know if we need to.

940
01:36:57,611 --> 01:37:10,414
So we might want to, as a courtesy to the applicant and to the residents who want to speak on this matter, who may want to hear the applicant, we could let the applicant's representative go next in public.

941
01:37:10,634 --> 01:37:12,575
I mean, they wouldn't be making a public comment.

942
01:37:12,595 --> 01:37:16,356
They would be representing the applicant, but they could make their presentation for this portion.

943
01:37:19,265 --> 01:37:23,067
Any residents that want to speak could continue to speak after that.

944
01:37:23,267 --> 01:37:28,990
And if the resident who already spoke has an additional comment, they could share that.

945
01:37:29,070 --> 01:37:35,174
So I don't see the need to close public comment, hear the presentation, and then reopen it.

946
01:37:35,434 --> 01:37:39,036
Although procedurally, I think the board could follow Robert's rules.

947
01:37:41,117 --> 01:37:43,258
Yeah, I just want to make sure we don't make any procedural issues.

948
01:37:43,278 --> 01:37:43,318
OK.

949
01:37:48,102 --> 01:37:52,285
Why don't we let the representative for the applicant go next?

950
01:37:56,548 --> 01:37:59,009
All right, good evening.

951
01:37:59,029 --> 01:37:59,930
Can you guys hear me okay?

952
01:38:02,172 --> 01:38:02,732
We can, yes.

953
01:38:02,792 --> 01:38:03,012
Thank you.

954
01:38:03,032 --> 01:38:04,373
All right, I apologize.

955
01:38:04,413 --> 01:38:06,214
I kept on trying to join the meeting earlier.

956
01:38:06,234 --> 01:38:08,836
You gave me a message that was waiting for the host to join.

957
01:38:08,856 --> 01:38:10,577
I was filing to get through now.

958
01:38:11,538 --> 01:38:13,619
My name is Skyke Rodriguez.

959
01:38:13,639 --> 01:38:17,562
I'm the builder of the property, and I'm also the applicant here representing Anthony and the family.

960
01:38:19,872 --> 01:38:23,633
You guys received the application as we explained on there.

961
01:38:24,533 --> 01:38:30,615
And just to reference back to the neighbor, and we can grab some measuring and double check on what she said.

962
01:38:31,235 --> 01:38:33,736
The fence is above six feet in some areas.

963
01:38:34,616 --> 01:38:35,997
It's not all around the property.

964
01:38:36,537 --> 01:38:38,557
It is in just some specifics.

965
01:38:39,137 --> 01:38:45,299
And as far as the aesthetically pleasing or not, I would also say that's just subjective to the eye of the beholder.

966
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:58,966
the client is seeking to have the fence to be at the current height, not due to just safety, but to also conclude the overall design features of the property.

967
01:38:58,986 --> 01:39:12,053
As you guys can see, I'm not sure if you have the pictures, the lot is higher in some instances, in some places, and the fence would have to be a little higher in some of those places to continue to provide safety.

968
01:39:14,111 --> 01:39:19,174
The abutus properties are on a higher plane, as you can see.

969
01:39:21,675 --> 01:39:23,556
If you have something to share, you can show that.

970
01:39:23,756 --> 01:39:25,457
We don't have any visuals right now.

971
01:39:25,797 --> 01:39:29,099
Let me see if I can give you this one second.

972
01:39:37,483 --> 01:39:38,123
Can you see my screen?

973
01:39:39,724 --> 01:39:39,944
Yes.

974
01:39:41,625 --> 01:39:43,126
So this is a direct picture of

975
01:39:44,101 --> 01:39:47,143
the fence where exactly is higher than six feet.

976
01:39:47,763 --> 01:39:48,864
It's in these areas here.

977
01:39:50,385 --> 01:39:58,469
And it provides tons of, you know, clearance from the street view to the properties nearby and the client on their backyard.

978
01:39:58,489 --> 01:40:09,595
I mean, I don't have a picture from this side of the backyard, but as you can see from these angles, it will provide greater privacy for the client so they can enjoy actually their backyard.

979
01:40:10,376 --> 01:40:11,056
And as you can see,

980
01:40:11,567 --> 01:40:19,050
The property is sitting on a plane, a higher plane, in reference to the neighbors behind them.

981
01:40:21,411 --> 01:40:22,451
And to the left of them as well.

982
01:40:37,598 --> 01:40:37,918
And I can...

983
01:40:39,664 --> 01:40:52,778
I can provide actual measurements of the fence just to respond to the neighbors where I think I heard somewhere around the nine feet, which is not accurate if we're measuring from the actual top to bottom of the fence.

984
01:40:58,564 --> 01:41:00,727
I've got a question from a board member, Mike.

985
01:41:02,016 --> 01:41:08,499
Yeah, I would just like to better understand in terms of the topography.

986
01:41:08,519 --> 01:41:19,844
Is the topography issue that the house is on a higher plane than the border of the

987
01:41:24,056 --> 01:41:31,098
of your own property or the applicant's own property or is it that the neighbor's houses are on a higher plane?

988
01:41:31,658 --> 01:41:44,162
So is it just that this house is elevated and then it slopes down and then it continues to either be flat or slope down past the neighbor or are the neighbors actually, are their properties too on a higher plane?

989
01:41:44,322 --> 01:41:50,130
So the home of 28 Winford is, of course, only is on an incline hill.

990
01:41:50,691 --> 01:41:57,159
The property is sitting lower as far as elevation wise in comparison to the neighbors behind and to the right side of the property.

991
01:41:58,101 --> 01:42:00,985
And that's just because and I can go back to that view.

992
01:42:01,784 --> 01:42:08,532
you know, the foundation of the property was, you know, digged in and the property sits lower than the neighboring houses.

993
01:42:09,012 --> 01:42:13,718
Hence why the fence being a little higher in some areas will provide that extra privacy to the owner.

994
01:42:14,779 --> 01:42:18,163
And that's just because of the typography of where the house is sitting at.

995
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:25,481
You know, the neighboring houses will have, you know, direct sight of everything, including the backyard.

996
01:42:26,402 --> 01:42:31,663
They will have direct sight into the, you know, there's a nice open kitchen to living room area.

997
01:42:31,683 --> 01:42:35,204
So there'll be direct sight through there without the fence being present.

998
01:42:35,224 --> 01:42:43,707
It would just be completely open, not just the neighbors, you know, we trust the neighbors, but to anyone else walking by, they'll have direct access and view into the property.

999
01:42:46,429 --> 01:42:56,792
Yeah, through the chair, I'll just say, for me, it's not obvious looking at the street view that there's a large difference in the height of the abutting property.

1000
01:42:56,892 --> 01:43:03,855
So it does look like the house is on one elevation, and then its own yard slopes down.

1001
01:43:05,275 --> 01:43:13,638
But it's not, I'm not seeing, maybe on the, I don't know the directionality here, but the brick building, maybe that's higher.

1002
01:43:15,258 --> 01:43:20,121
It looks like the neighbor, the white building is lower, if anything.

1003
01:43:24,364 --> 01:43:36,412
Yeah, that White House is definitely lower than, and I, from my, especially from Google Maps, I'm saying the same.

1004
01:43:36,932 --> 01:43:39,174
On the right side, they seem to be on the same plane.

1005
01:43:40,514 --> 01:43:41,375
I can't tell from the back.

1006
01:43:58,290 --> 01:44:01,354
For the applicant, do you have anything else to add?

1007
01:44:06,741 --> 01:44:08,564
Can you just zoom in a little bit on this photo?

1008
01:44:08,704 --> 01:44:10,827
Sorry, I just want to be able to kind of see that a little better.

1009
01:44:28,840 --> 01:44:29,864
There's the fence in the back.

1010
01:44:33,637 --> 01:44:35,383
Right, so this is in the rear of the property.

1011
01:44:45,563 --> 01:44:46,824
This is a question for the applicant.

1012
01:44:46,844 --> 01:44:50,366
I can't hear you here speaking.

1013
01:44:50,947 --> 01:44:51,868
Sorry, I was on mute again.

1014
01:44:52,728 --> 01:44:57,892
So this gives you a better view of what we're talking about as far as the elevation on the property, right?

1015
01:44:58,172 --> 01:45:04,657
It's different levels, especially on the backyard, as you can see, it's a lot higher than on the sides.

1016
01:45:05,037 --> 01:45:10,301
So that's why the fence here needed to be taller to provide actual privacy to this side of the house.

1017
01:45:11,098 --> 01:45:13,960
Well, what and so how high is the fence right here?

1018
01:45:13,980 --> 01:45:13,960
7.

1019
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:21,244
7 feet and we have our land surveyor went in.

1020
01:45:21,304 --> 01:45:24,426
He took measurements of everything and I believe I submitted that to the board.

1021
01:45:26,207 --> 01:45:27,828
It's in it's about 6 feet.

1022
01:45:28,168 --> 01:45:31,189
Most of the areas and everywhere else 7 feet a little taller than that.

1023
01:45:36,873 --> 01:45:38,214
I might have documentations here.

1024
01:45:38,274 --> 01:45:38,614
Give me a 2nd.

1025
01:46:00,096 --> 01:46:01,256
So let's see if this is where.

1026
01:46:06,037 --> 01:46:14,819
So under six feet, all in this side of the lot, over six feet through the rear.

1027
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:21,281
But it's not nine, it's seven and a quarter.

1028
01:46:24,761 --> 01:46:26,462
And this was done by Medford Survey.

1029
01:46:26,522 --> 01:46:27,502
We didn't do this ourselves.

1030
01:46:28,690 --> 01:46:28,830
Right.

1031
01:46:28,870 --> 01:46:31,692
Well, over six feet doesn't really answer the question.

1032
01:46:31,712 --> 01:46:32,533
Yeah.

1033
01:46:32,573 --> 01:46:36,556
I can get direct, I can get direct measurements and I can submit it to the board again as well.

1034
01:46:37,336 --> 01:46:42,900
Also just, I mean, from that image, like it's, it's past the roof line of the white house.

1035
01:46:43,320 --> 01:46:44,681
So, I mean, yeah.

1036
01:46:45,142 --> 01:46:47,103
The photo is taken from a lower angle.

1037
01:46:47,423 --> 01:46:52,527
Um, the person isn't standing straight with a camera, you know, at eye level.

1038
01:46:52,727 --> 01:46:55,729
So, um, I can't, I can't use this photo to make judgment.

1039
01:46:56,750 --> 01:46:56,830
Um,

1040
01:47:01,532 --> 01:47:07,195
But if it helps, I can get direct measurements from pretty much every square inch around the fence.

1041
01:47:07,275 --> 01:47:10,497
And I can submit that to the board if that will help suffice.

1042
01:47:10,517 --> 01:47:30,528
I mean, I would definitely like accurate measurements of this before making a decision, but, you know, I mean, I think for our purposes right now, we should kind of continue the public hearing, hear the comments and then, you know, deliberate as a board about the next step.

1043
01:47:33,418 --> 01:47:33,678
Okay.

1044
01:47:35,999 --> 01:47:37,159
Thanks for sharing those images.

1045
01:47:37,179 --> 01:47:45,963
I'll get the emails from Lane about her as well.

1046
01:47:46,203 --> 01:47:46,943
I can share those.

1047
01:47:53,005 --> 01:47:54,546
Yeah, I'd like to see those photos.

1048
01:48:02,953 --> 01:48:08,215
So this is the, I believe this is the, I'm better on the rear.

1049
01:48:08,935 --> 01:48:10,395
No, that's me.

1050
01:48:10,535 --> 01:48:11,315
I'm on the right.

1051
01:48:11,355 --> 01:48:15,077
And that's the image that Mr. Rodriguez did not show you.

1052
01:48:15,117 --> 01:48:18,317
He showed you every side of the property in the back, except mine.

1053
01:48:18,678 --> 01:48:20,698
This is mine and this is what I see.

1054
01:48:21,038 --> 01:48:21,919
I took this today.

1055
01:48:21,939 --> 01:48:28,680
Through the chair, is the white fence six foot?

1056
01:48:30,001 --> 01:48:30,201
Yes.

1057
01:48:31,725 --> 01:48:34,327
From the ground to the top of the fence is six foot.

1058
01:48:38,589 --> 01:48:50,777
And I would like to also, if I can at this moment, go back since I said, with regards to the measurement, I mean, the building department, Paul Smith, has gone out many times there.

1059
01:48:51,157 --> 01:48:53,658
I mean, I would like to request that he measure this fence.

1060
01:48:54,199 --> 01:49:01,303
I think we should have an unbiased person who works for the building department, who has already gone out there several times, measure this fence.

1061
01:49:01,803 --> 01:49:09,065
As you can see, look at the height difference, which Mr. Rodriguez didn't show you one image of my side of the fence.

1062
01:49:09,645 --> 01:49:14,126
Also, I'd like to add the image that he showed you was an old image.

1063
01:49:14,286 --> 01:49:16,667
If you see on the left of this image, see the fence?

1064
01:49:16,727 --> 01:49:18,307
It goes all the way down to the street.

1065
01:49:18,787 --> 01:49:20,207
That's in code.

1066
01:49:20,367 --> 01:49:21,268
I'm not disputing it.

1067
01:49:21,288 --> 01:49:27,709
But do you see the difference from the height from what's the new fence that they added after the pictures that he just showed you?

1068
01:49:27,729 --> 01:49:29,249
Because those were old pictures.

1069
01:49:29,309 --> 01:49:30,590
These are new pictures, right?

1070
01:49:30,610 --> 01:49:31,230
These are today.

1071
01:49:31,910 --> 01:49:35,511
and you can see the fence how it goes on the left, that's cold.

1072
01:49:36,031 --> 01:49:40,091
Do you see on the top the difference in height?

1073
01:49:40,692 --> 01:49:46,493
I'm sorry, but this is not seven feet, it's not six feet and a quarter, this is closer to nine.

1074
01:49:46,713 --> 01:49:56,414
I respectfully ask that an independent person from the building department go out and measure, not the contractor who's defending and trying to represent the owner.

1075
01:49:57,034 --> 01:49:58,635
Mrs. DeFabregas, a question.

1076
01:50:01,119 --> 01:50:02,960
Are you in the Brick House or the White House?

1077
01:50:03,261 --> 01:50:04,101
I'm in the Brick House.

1078
01:50:04,522 --> 01:50:05,342
Okay, thank you.

1079
01:50:05,983 --> 01:50:11,847
And there's another image if you can, Dennis, if you're able to, yeah, there you go.

1080
01:50:12,107 --> 01:50:17,131
And I like to go back to, Mr. Rodriguez mentioned safety.

1081
01:50:17,211 --> 01:50:24,556
What safety issues are we talking about that justifies a fence that's ridiculously high like this?

1082
01:50:24,616 --> 01:50:26,077
Where's the safety concerns here?

1083
01:50:33,321 --> 01:50:37,766
We don't typically have the applicant respond to public comment.

1084
01:50:44,897 --> 01:50:49,039
This goes back to my comment that it's like a prison wall.

1085
01:50:49,439 --> 01:50:55,303
If you saw the pictures today of this property, the entire house is barricaded in.

1086
01:50:55,503 --> 01:50:56,764
That's their right to do so.

1087
01:50:56,824 --> 01:50:57,664
Don't get me wrong.

1088
01:50:58,485 --> 01:51:02,728
But the height of the fence is ridiculously absurd high in the back.

1089
01:51:03,248 --> 01:51:08,271
And I see two of my neighbors who have got their hands raised, and I'd like to let them

1090
01:51:09,772 --> 01:51:18,380
you know, chime in and express their comments, because as you're going to see, I'm not the only one who, you know, feels strongly that this is ridiculous.

1091
01:51:18,520 --> 01:51:24,385
So I'm going to I like to defer to the Amigos on Jennifer Schnabel.

1092
01:51:26,066 --> 01:51:26,627
Thank you, Lisa.

1093
01:51:27,147 --> 01:51:28,569
I see you, Wayne Amigo.

1094
01:51:30,650 --> 01:51:34,534
Good evening, Mr. Chairman, members of the board, Wayne and Len Amigo, 24 Alden Lane.

1095
01:51:37,768 --> 01:51:39,690
We appreciate the opportunity to talk tonight.

1096
01:51:39,910 --> 01:51:41,091
I guess we want to start off.

1097
01:51:41,211 --> 01:51:43,873
I do have some images I'd like to share with you as well.

1098
01:51:45,094 --> 01:51:49,958
We don't necessarily object to the fence along our portion of the property line.

1099
01:51:51,119 --> 01:51:53,501
We wanted to understand what this hearing was about tonight.

1100
01:51:53,861 --> 01:52:03,889
We wanted to make sure that the applicant or his builder are not interested in increasing the height of the fence and just to

1101
01:52:05,251 --> 01:52:08,873
I guess assuage any misunderstanding.

1102
01:52:09,574 --> 01:52:10,835
I took measurements yesterday.

1103
01:52:12,276 --> 01:52:30,651
They range from 9 1⁄2 feet, 9, 8 1⁄2, 8, 6, 6, 5 1⁄2, 5, 4 1⁄2, and 4, all the way down on the property line between 28 Winford and 24 Alden, from the back near the Schnabels to the street line, which is 4 feet.

1104
01:52:30,691 --> 01:52:31,772
It ranges from 9 1⁄2 feet to 4 feet.

1105
01:52:33,413 --> 01:52:34,214
have those measurements.

1106
01:52:34,934 --> 01:52:36,795
I'm actually a registered professional engineer.

1107
01:52:36,855 --> 01:52:39,056
Be glad to certify those measurements if you'd like me to.

1108
01:52:39,996 --> 01:52:43,858
But they are accurate based on the tape measure that I used yesterday.

1109
01:52:45,119 --> 01:52:50,121
I do have some images that are very persuasive I could just share.

1110
01:52:55,384 --> 01:52:57,725
It looks like somebody has to give me permission to share.

1111
01:53:03,226 --> 01:53:04,046
Excellent, thank you.

1112
01:53:05,287 --> 01:53:06,928
Screen two, okay.

1113
01:53:08,188 --> 01:53:13,391
Hopefully, bear with me.

1114
01:53:14,131 --> 01:53:15,071
Can you see my photos?

1115
01:53:15,111 --> 01:53:15,992
We can see them.

1116
01:53:16,012 --> 01:53:21,214
Okay, so this is standing in the backyard, 28 Alden Lane.

1117
01:53:21,914 --> 01:53:25,136
This is the measurement, it was 24, sorry.

1118
01:53:25,596 --> 01:53:28,657
Roughly nine and a half feet, and you can see it progressively go down.

1119
01:53:28,677 --> 01:53:30,118
I took some pictures, you can see it.

1120
01:53:31,353 --> 01:53:34,135
And then this is the retaining wall between our properties.

1121
01:53:34,695 --> 01:53:43,240
This drops down in the five and a half foot, and then farther down to four feet here at the street line.

1122
01:53:43,721 --> 01:53:47,503
And this section is clearly on the applicant's property, no question.

1123
01:53:47,543 --> 01:53:54,867
And as I said, we don't necessarily object to the height along our perimeter, but I'm hearing all these different dimensions.

1124
01:53:55,147 --> 01:53:59,110
And the second one Lisa mentioned, clearly,

1125
01:53:59,933 --> 01:54:04,188
A good portion of this fence is nine to nine and a half feet high.

1126
01:54:05,795 --> 01:54:06,876
I don't know if you want to add anything.

1127
01:54:06,956 --> 01:54:07,156
Yeah.

1128
01:54:07,296 --> 01:54:12,020
So the builder was nice enough when we did talk to him because my father was living in the house.

1129
01:54:12,040 --> 01:54:12,861
He's now passed.

1130
01:54:12,961 --> 01:54:21,948
But that fence that comes down to the to the sidewalk was so high, my dad couldn't even back up without being into the street.

1131
01:54:22,288 --> 01:54:24,249
So he was nice enough to cut that down.

1132
01:54:24,670 --> 01:54:26,251
Again, it goes up gradually.

1133
01:54:26,571 --> 01:54:28,132
Then it does go up.

1134
01:54:28,232 --> 01:54:35,238
So the unfortunate pictures he did show you was when the fence was not finished and they added a whole nother row

1135
01:54:36,284 --> 01:54:39,107
Section on there, there was another, like, 3 feet tall.

1136
01:54:39,667 --> 01:54:43,211
So, again, I don't particularly love the fence either.

1137
01:54:43,231 --> 01:54:49,597
Aesthetically, I think a white fence or something, but that's not for me to say, but on our side of the property, it gives us.

1138
01:54:51,118 --> 01:54:53,019
definitely some privacy from them, too.

1139
01:54:53,439 --> 01:54:55,200
But it cannot go any higher.

1140
01:54:55,240 --> 01:55:05,666
So if he's saying he wants to add another two feet to the end and keep going up to going up seven feet from the sidewalk area, we won't be able to back up a car without getting killed.

1141
01:55:05,806 --> 01:55:06,886
So talk about safety.

1142
01:55:06,926 --> 01:55:12,189
That's my issue is it's OK on our side the way it is, even though it is rather tall.

1143
01:55:14,745 --> 01:55:17,827
but I just can't have it being any taller than it is right now.

1144
01:55:18,127 --> 01:55:23,109
And if he wants a seven-foot tall fence or higher, it can't be any taller.

1145
01:55:23,329 --> 01:55:29,372
So we'd be willing to live with it the way it is, but nothing can be adjusted or added to our section.

1146
01:55:29,432 --> 01:55:35,495
And then our other neighbor next to us, who'll talk next, his, I believe, is 10 feet tall, but he can talk about that.

1147
01:55:36,675 --> 01:55:37,536
So thank you.

1148
01:55:37,576 --> 01:55:39,016
Thank you for the update.

1149
01:55:39,637 --> 01:55:42,658
If you could, for me, show the next picture.

1150
01:55:43,367 --> 01:55:45,109
where you showed your retaining wall?

1151
01:55:47,191 --> 01:55:48,472
The next one, I think he wants you, yeah.

1152
01:55:50,534 --> 01:55:52,435
Okay, so that, yeah.

1153
01:55:53,036 --> 01:55:54,297
So that's, what do we measure that at?

1154
01:55:54,777 --> 01:55:58,341
That varied, it was, I think if I remember right, let me look at my measurements.

1155
01:55:58,361 --> 01:56:02,404
I think that was six, six in that area.

1156
01:56:02,905 --> 01:56:04,066
That was around six feet.

1157
01:56:05,527 --> 01:56:07,609
And do you know how high it is above the retaining wall?

1158
01:56:09,350 --> 01:56:15,573
I'm guessing it's probably two feet or so above that retaining wall.

1159
01:56:16,834 --> 01:56:21,496
And then the concern on the front of the house, I think you're raising is because the street is curved.

1160
01:56:22,116 --> 01:56:23,156
Visibility is an issue.

1161
01:56:23,276 --> 01:56:25,437
Oh yeah, we cannot back out of that driveway.

1162
01:56:25,477 --> 01:56:26,218
We will get killed.

1163
01:56:26,238 --> 01:56:28,118
We'd have to literally be into the street.

1164
01:56:28,178 --> 01:56:29,299
And that's his right to have that.

1165
01:56:29,319 --> 01:56:30,960
I wish that wasn't there, that part of it.

1166
01:56:32,942 --> 01:56:34,364
I wish it wasn't there, but it is.

1167
01:56:34,624 --> 01:56:37,488
So at least he cut it down so my father wouldn't get killed backing up.

1168
01:56:37,748 --> 01:56:45,157
So but it can't be like you can't say, OK, now I want to set a seven foot fence all the way around, because then I'll get killed backing out of my own driveway.

1169
01:56:45,598 --> 01:56:49,643
This is this is a copy of mass just to give you guys proximity.

1170
01:56:49,683 --> 01:56:50,424
This is twenty eight.

1171
01:56:51,337 --> 01:56:52,678
24 is here, here's the property line.

1172
01:56:53,439 --> 01:56:54,959
My father-in-law's driveway is here.

1173
01:56:55,340 --> 01:56:58,222
The fence is roughly right there along that property line.

1174
01:56:58,262 --> 01:57:03,145
And to Dylan's point, the fence comes out right to the property line, which is his right.

1175
01:57:03,925 --> 01:57:10,309
But if you're backing out, you could not see over your right shoulder if it was any taller than it was.

1176
01:57:12,511 --> 01:57:17,174
So like I said, my concern is now that he wants to make a fence even taller, where is this fence going to be taller?

1177
01:57:18,345 --> 01:57:18,846
It can't be.

1178
01:57:19,287 --> 01:57:20,749
I mean, it just would be ridiculous.

1179
01:57:20,769 --> 01:57:27,821
And it is an eyesore, but again, they have the right to have offense, but it has to be properly done and safe for everybody.

1180
01:57:27,881 --> 01:57:32,188
And this being the shorter end definitely makes it safe getting out of our driveway.

1181
01:57:32,862 --> 01:57:34,663
Yes, and I appreciate everything you guys said.

1182
01:57:34,703 --> 01:57:39,367
And just to answer your question, the homeowner doesn't plan on making the fence any taller.

1183
01:57:40,388 --> 01:57:45,111
Like you mentioned, it was already addressed that you guys had no visibility when backing out of your house.

1184
01:57:45,572 --> 01:57:47,853
And that's why the fence is lower on that side.

1185
01:57:48,594 --> 01:57:50,676
The whole purpose of the meeting is not to make it any taller.

1186
01:57:50,696 --> 01:57:57,661
It's just to make sure that the surrounding neighbors are okay and happy with it being taller in some areas.

1187
01:57:58,021 --> 01:57:59,402
It's not going to change.

1188
01:57:59,602 --> 01:58:01,564
It should ideally remain the way it is.

1189
01:58:02,310 --> 01:58:05,934
We appreciate that, and we appreciate what you did to modify that at our request, so thank you.

1190
01:58:10,138 --> 01:58:10,598
Thank you.

1191
01:58:10,618 --> 01:58:15,103
I see Lisa D. Fabritas, you still have your hand up.

1192
01:58:15,163 --> 01:58:17,665
I'll let Jennifer go first.

1193
01:58:18,046 --> 01:58:18,406
Thank you.

1194
01:58:18,426 --> 01:58:20,128
Okay, thank you.

1195
01:58:20,208 --> 01:58:22,190
I see Jennifer Schnabel has her hand up.

1196
01:58:26,490 --> 01:58:33,272
Hi, Fred and Jenny Schnabel at 22 Alden Lane, where the abutter is on the backside of the property in question.

1197
01:58:34,872 --> 01:58:44,734
And I just wanted to raise as a point of fact that by my measurements, we're between well over eight and a half and nine and a half feet of depending where along the line you measure.

1198
01:58:49,656 --> 01:58:51,516
So it is quite tall from our perspective.

1199
01:58:55,475 --> 01:59:07,465
I'll add that we are at a higher level, so their view would be looking up into

1200
01:59:09,903 --> 01:59:12,584
our dining room or deck.

1201
01:59:14,464 --> 01:59:19,505
So privacy, we understand why they wanted to make a taller fence.

1202
01:59:20,085 --> 01:59:28,206
Aesthetically, the fence is fine with us, but it is much, much taller than the area.

1203
01:59:29,126 --> 01:59:38,028
Well, I would say also the previous owners had about a six foot fence there, and we never could see into their backyard at all.

1204
01:59:38,797 --> 01:59:40,098
from any angle.

1205
01:59:42,119 --> 01:59:46,561
And also would like to just confirm that indeed this fence was put up in two stages.

1206
01:59:46,901 --> 01:59:50,763
I don't remember the chronology, but it was put up at probably about six feet.

1207
01:59:51,564 --> 01:59:59,748
And then sometime later, an additional section was added all the way around to make it the approximate nine plus feet that now.

1208
02:00:02,349 --> 02:00:03,770
That's all we have.

1209
02:00:05,351 --> 02:00:05,611
Thank you.

1210
02:00:06,380 --> 02:00:08,401
what Fred stated is accurate as well.

1211
02:00:08,441 --> 02:00:09,842
This is Wayne again, sorry.

1212
02:00:10,262 --> 02:00:11,782
If you're interested, I could share.

1213
02:00:11,862 --> 02:00:16,364
You can actually see the joints where the additional fence was added on, for what it's worth.

1214
02:00:16,825 --> 02:00:20,286
Again, not that you have to object with it, but just for clarification.

1215
02:00:21,026 --> 02:00:28,990
Yeah, we're looking at it from the perspective of it did not exist and it's been, and looking at what it would be allowed to be.

1216
02:00:33,180 --> 02:00:44,267
I'm just wondering if, you know, the photos that the amigos took could be sent to Dennis and, you know, shared with the board and be part of the public record.

1217
02:00:45,048 --> 02:00:46,009
I'll do that right now.

1218
02:00:46,309 --> 02:00:46,809
Be glad to.

1219
02:00:47,410 --> 02:00:47,750
Thank you.

1220
02:00:49,031 --> 02:00:49,451
Thank you.

1221
02:00:56,075 --> 02:00:56,456
Thank you.

1222
02:00:57,317 --> 02:01:08,312
So, as a me goes mentioned on their side, it's lower and they had asked when they extended the fence to the sidewalk, there were, as I, as I stated, they initially were putting it much higher and they.

1223
02:01:08,912 --> 02:01:12,735
asked the contractor to make it lower and they accommodated.

1224
02:01:12,815 --> 02:01:19,260
So as you can see from their photos, it is lower, it's within code and they're accepting of that height.

1225
02:01:19,500 --> 02:01:30,008
But as you can see in the back and as stated, in contrary to what has been stated by the contractor, that this is not seven feet, this is well like nine feet.

1226
02:01:30,769 --> 02:01:36,873
And the fact that they're okay with it because it's lower and they're lower and it's not that high for them.

1227
02:01:37,674 --> 02:01:42,096
You know, on my pictures and my side, it's significantly higher.

1228
02:01:42,136 --> 02:01:45,738
And as I showed you in my pictures, it's it's aesthetically ugly.

1229
02:01:45,758 --> 02:01:47,719
I am very unhappy with it.

1230
02:01:49,080 --> 02:01:54,563
They added it was six feet, but they decided the owners, from my understanding, wanted it higher.

1231
02:01:54,923 --> 02:01:56,664
There's nothing about privacy here.

1232
02:01:56,784 --> 02:01:58,024
I mean, they have privacy.

1233
02:01:58,064 --> 02:01:59,325
The fence gives you privacy.

1234
02:01:59,725 --> 02:02:06,249
I mean, I don't understand how much higher you want to do to prevent me from the sun, to not see anything.

1235
02:02:06,849 --> 02:02:09,511
I have a neighbor who's got two-story house on my other side.

1236
02:02:09,611 --> 02:02:11,532
I can see that they can look into my house.

1237
02:02:11,552 --> 02:02:14,414
What am I going to do, put a fence all the way up to their roof?

1238
02:02:14,534 --> 02:02:15,835
I mean, it's ridiculous.

1239
02:02:16,115 --> 02:02:17,456
There's codes for a reason.

1240
02:02:17,676 --> 02:02:18,776
The code is six foot.

1241
02:02:19,617 --> 02:02:27,882
Unless everybody's in agreement or the butters are okay with it, I can understand why this meeting's here and you would approve something like this.

1242
02:02:28,262 --> 02:02:30,924
But I'm upset about it.

1243
02:02:32,405 --> 02:02:39,949
As Jennifer mentioned, she doesn't think it's the prettiest fence either, but it gives her privacy.

1244
02:02:40,109 --> 02:02:43,171
And everybody's basically said it's not aesthetically, it's an eyesore.

1245
02:02:43,631 --> 02:02:49,375
And I'm the one who's actually, because I have my fence, the amigos don't have a fence.

1246
02:02:49,395 --> 02:02:51,016
So for them, that's the only fence.

1247
02:02:52,036 --> 02:02:55,539
Aesthetically, it looks nice for them because there's not another fence.

1248
02:02:55,979 --> 02:02:59,381
The wood fence is overpowering this, right?

1249
02:02:59,761 --> 02:03:01,202
The Schnabel's, the same thing.

1250
02:03:01,242 --> 02:03:02,343
They don't have a fence.

1251
02:03:02,703 --> 02:03:06,245
That wooden fence is the only fence between their two properties, right?

1252
02:03:06,726 --> 02:03:12,529
On my side, which is, okay, which is, again, is the nine and a half, 10 feet, as you can see in the pictures.

1253
02:03:13,750 --> 02:03:25,794
I have a fence of six foot and all you see is this extra three and a half foot of brown ugly fence that contrasts and just makes my fence and my yard look aesthetically ugly and it's very upsetting to me.

1254
02:03:26,154 --> 02:03:35,257
I think I have a right to express that and say I don't approve and I think it's we have to all go back to the initial purpose of this is

1255
02:03:35,837 --> 02:03:36,958
There's a code.

1256
02:03:37,938 --> 02:03:39,859
But they were supposed to get a permit for this.

1257
02:03:39,939 --> 02:03:40,480
They didn't.

1258
02:03:40,580 --> 02:03:43,621
They've ignored the building department for almost a year now.

1259
02:03:43,861 --> 02:03:48,744
They have been fined several times for noncompliance, for not responding.

1260
02:03:49,044 --> 02:03:56,368
They're only here today because they got a final letter from the building department that if they don't cut the fence, they're giving it to legal.

1261
02:03:56,448 --> 02:04:00,230
That's the only reason we're here today, because they just think they can do whatever they want.

1262
02:04:00,350 --> 02:04:00,951
I'm sorry.

1263
02:04:01,191 --> 02:04:02,652
I'm very upset, as you can see.

1264
02:04:03,312 --> 02:04:14,520
And I think people, you know, I wasted a year of my time calling, staying in touch and keeping us because as you can see, I'm very upset about the aesthetically how this makes my house look in my yard.

1265
02:04:15,280 --> 02:04:27,569
And I hope that the this the this the committee will take all this into consideration and make these make the owners bring the fence down to code the way it should be, because that's it.

1266
02:04:27,649 --> 02:04:28,330
I mean, nobody's

1267
02:04:29,631 --> 02:04:34,755
Nobody should be exempt from the way the law works and the whole process works.

1268
02:04:35,135 --> 02:04:37,236
I don't care if someone is the ex-president of the task.

1269
02:04:37,857 --> 02:04:39,478
They know better than me or anybody else.

1270
02:04:39,618 --> 02:04:40,219
I'm sorry.

1271
02:04:43,161 --> 02:04:43,421
Thank you.

1272
02:04:43,441 --> 02:04:44,502
Thank you, Mrs. DeFabritis.

1273
02:04:46,624 --> 02:04:47,905
Any other public comment?

1274
02:04:55,291 --> 02:04:58,273
Chair awaits a motion to close public comment and enter deliberation.

1275
02:04:59,165 --> 02:05:02,126
I motion to close public comment and enter deliberation.

1276
02:05:03,266 --> 02:05:03,806
Second.

1277
02:05:06,447 --> 02:05:08,328
And we will do a roll.

1278
02:05:09,608 --> 02:05:10,148
Mike Caldera?

1279
02:05:11,309 --> 02:05:11,449
Aye.

1280
02:05:12,829 --> 02:05:13,309
Mary Lee?

1281
02:05:14,510 --> 02:05:14,590
Aye.

1282
02:05:14,610 --> 02:05:16,450
Yvette Velez?

1283
02:05:17,391 --> 02:05:17,511
Aye.

1284
02:05:18,671 --> 02:05:19,271
Andre LaRue?

1285
02:05:19,991 --> 02:05:20,131
Aye.

1286
02:05:21,312 --> 02:05:22,112
And Jamie Thompson?

1287
02:05:22,192 --> 02:05:22,292
Aye.

1288
02:05:23,498 --> 02:05:31,240
All right, so for the board, again, we do have to look at this from the perspective that the fence does not currently exist and is being requested to be built.

1289
02:05:32,260 --> 02:05:34,181
We obviously have seen pictures of the condition.

1290
02:05:36,221 --> 02:05:36,761
What are your thoughts?

1291
02:05:43,423 --> 02:05:43,683
Andre?

1292
02:05:45,363 --> 02:05:50,405
Yeah, so I have a few thoughts.

1293
02:05:50,425 --> 02:05:51,365
So one is that

1294
02:05:53,842 --> 02:05:56,884
people's aesthetics are different.

1295
02:05:57,304 --> 02:06:08,271
For me, a house very beautiful, attractive, modernist, fence goes with the style, but the problem obviously is the height of the fence.

1296
02:06:08,291 --> 02:06:13,475
I am disturbed by the fact that the applicant never actually

1297
02:06:14,570 --> 02:06:22,677
was an applicant and did not come in front of us to proactively deal with this issue when they were building the fence.

1298
02:06:26,180 --> 02:06:32,265
I think the challenge for me is just the topography a little bit in the back.

1299
02:06:34,006 --> 02:06:40,331
I would not be averse to allowing the fence to go somewhat over six feet if

1300
02:06:41,252 --> 02:06:47,116
you know, to adjust for some of the difference in topography there.

1301
02:06:47,196 --> 02:06:56,683
But I found the, you know, the photos by the, the Amigos very compelling that, I mean, that was extraordinary at the corner of the property.

1302
02:06:56,723 --> 02:06:58,885
That's an extraordinarily tall fence.

1303
02:06:58,945 --> 02:07:03,068
And I understand from that perspective, you know, why it might look like a barricade.

1304
02:07:03,088 --> 02:07:03,128
So,

1305
02:07:07,213 --> 02:07:34,705
You know, I guess not having the actual dimensions of the fence is problematic for me because there's no way for us to try to address this in a way that accommodates, you know, the homeowner's desires for privacy and consistency of the fence with the, you know, butters' desires to have the fence be at six feet, which is, you know,

1306
02:07:36,446 --> 02:07:37,026
our ordinance.

1307
02:07:37,807 --> 02:07:39,147
So I just want to raise those points.

1308
02:07:39,187 --> 02:07:45,230
I'm still processing this right now, and I'll be happy to hear from the other board members.

1309
02:07:49,132 --> 02:07:50,292
Thank you, Andrew.

1310
02:07:50,352 --> 02:07:50,873
Mike, go ahead.

1311
02:07:52,493 --> 02:07:59,036
Yeah, so the topography of the lot is clearly unusual.

1312
02:08:03,045 --> 02:08:16,775
However, the applicant has not provided enough information to speak to the hardship that that literal enforcement imposes here.

1313
02:08:16,795 --> 02:08:25,782
Just to pick an extreme example, and this isn't exactly the case here, but I think it may come to play, at least for part of the lot.

1314
02:08:26,623 --> 02:08:30,465
If someone had a house on a hill under the,

1315
02:08:32,920 --> 02:08:44,150
analysis a zoning board goes through that doesn't present a hardship that would enable them to essentially erect a castle wall around their hill.

1316
02:08:45,071 --> 02:08:50,716
If the neighbors are all on a lower elevation and you're on a higher elevation, well, you bought a house on a hill.

1317
02:08:50,736 --> 02:08:53,559
That's not entirely the case here.

1318
02:08:53,579 --> 02:08:55,561
I think there's perhaps

1319
02:08:56,968 --> 02:09:16,963
a case to be made for a portion of the lot where the topography really does present a hardship that would impact the typical privacy that any landowner that wants a fence would enjoy.

1320
02:09:17,884 --> 02:09:21,226
Applicant did not provide that information.

1321
02:09:22,082 --> 02:09:24,803
The applicant has offered to provide more information.

1322
02:09:25,783 --> 02:09:32,526
And so, you know, continuing would potentially get the board the information it needs to weigh in on that.

1323
02:09:33,526 --> 02:09:43,849
From where I'm sitting, clearly this fence as proposed is a detriment, is a substantial detriment to the public good in some aspects.

1324
02:09:43,909 --> 02:09:49,311
Maybe not the whole thing, but in some aspects, it's a substantial detriment to the public good.

1325
02:09:50,171 --> 02:09:51,632
From my perspective, we could,

1326
02:09:53,081 --> 02:10:00,886
have the applicant come back and give any measurements outside of the whole fence is six foot and that wouldn't change.

1327
02:10:01,006 --> 02:10:10,852
I think the photos we're seeing of the impact to the neighbor's property who has a six foot fence is concerning to say the least.

1328
02:10:10,952 --> 02:10:19,137
And it does not appear to be at all necessary to get the privacy that a fence typically affords.

1329
02:10:19,217 --> 02:10:20,277
So for me,

1330
02:10:22,315 --> 02:10:27,004
I do not think that desirable relief may be granted without substantial detriment of the public good.

1331
02:10:27,024 --> 02:10:29,969
I think it's pretty clear cut.

1332
02:10:30,971 --> 02:10:32,494
And so, yeah, I

1333
02:10:33,374 --> 02:10:36,335
I do not see a path to grant a variance here.

1334
02:10:36,816 --> 02:10:46,901
If the applicant wants to come back and either request the board reconsider, if there's an unfavorable vote here, they're welcome to do so.

1335
02:10:47,021 --> 02:11:02,268
But we need to see a plan for a fence that actually just has the added height in the areas where the added height is necessary, not this high all over the place fence that's really causing problems for the neighbors.

1336
02:11:07,922 --> 02:11:09,122
Thank you for that perspective, Mike.

1337
02:11:09,762 --> 02:11:18,264
And I'll just ask, you brought up the perspective of continuance.

1338
02:11:19,325 --> 02:11:36,789
I'll just ask the applicant's representative, based on the information you've heard, are you considering requesting a continuance to bring us more information with which the request can be discussed, or do you want us to

1339
02:11:37,571 --> 02:11:38,391
continue to move forward.

1340
02:11:41,813 --> 02:11:43,594
Yes, that would be ideal.

1341
02:11:43,834 --> 02:11:48,957
If we can meet again, I can provide additional documentation.

1342
02:11:49,037 --> 02:11:52,679
I can sit with the owner and talk about what's possible.

1343
02:11:53,380 --> 02:11:59,203
We don't want to be a burden to the neighbors, and I understand where they're coming from.

1344
02:11:59,343 --> 02:12:06,207
So I'd like to sit with the owner and see what we can do in regards to the continuation of the meeting.

1345
02:12:10,792 --> 02:12:13,895
Okay.

1346
02:12:13,995 --> 02:12:32,549
Chair awaits a motion to continue 28 Winford Way to the next scheduled meeting.

1347
02:12:33,309 --> 02:12:34,030
It's May 30th.

1348
02:12:37,012 --> 02:12:37,473
So moved.

1349
02:12:37,493 --> 02:12:37,773
Thank you.

1350
02:12:44,447 --> 02:12:46,648
I wrote a call.

1351
02:12:47,468 --> 02:12:48,068
Under the roof.

1352
02:12:49,048 --> 02:12:55,210
And that the last.

1353
02:12:57,771 --> 02:12:59,792
Mary Lee.

1354
02:13:01,392 --> 02:13:03,393
Michael there.

1355
02:13:03,413 --> 02:13:10,735
And Jamie Thompson I. So the applicant.

1356
02:13:13,322 --> 02:13:20,687
Obviously, we are looking for more data to understand the hardship and the difficulty for the owner.

1357
02:13:24,550 --> 02:13:25,250
At the next meeting.

1358
02:13:29,793 --> 02:13:30,314
Thank you, Jamie.

1359
02:13:30,334 --> 02:13:34,136
Appreciate it.

1360
02:13:34,257 --> 02:13:37,659
Dennis, can you take us to the next one?

1361
02:13:40,320 --> 02:13:43,101
86 Orchard Street, case number 8-2024-08.

1362
02:13:43,402 --> 02:13:50,245
Applicant and owner, Kevin McLaughlin, is petitioning for a variance in Chapter 94, City of Memphis zoning to renovate third floor apartment at 86 Orchard Street.

1363
02:13:50,685 --> 02:13:56,928
Three family houses are not allowed in the general residence zone for the City of Memphis zoning ordinance, Chapter 94, Table A, table of use in parking regulations.

1364
02:14:01,930 --> 02:14:02,351
Thank you.

1365
02:14:02,391 --> 02:14:03,791
Do we have a representative for the applicant?

1366
02:14:04,532 --> 02:14:07,273
Yes, Bruce Simmons on behalf of Kevin McLaughlin.

1367
02:14:09,105 --> 02:14:12,427
Thank you, Mr. Fitzsimmons.

1368
02:14:12,447 --> 02:14:13,388
Go ahead.

1369
02:14:13,408 --> 02:14:20,173
So as I laid out in my memorandum that accompanied the application, 86 Orchard Street is in a GR district.

1370
02:14:20,373 --> 02:14:26,257
It is a residential property that has been used for a very long time, has a three family.

1371
02:14:26,277 --> 02:14:32,622
And to evidence that I've provided with the memorandum,

1372
02:14:34,203 --> 02:14:36,064
voting records that go back to 1928.

1373
02:14:38,245 --> 02:14:55,531
And when you look through those records, what you see consistently is three sets of tenants at the property, either individual tenants in an apartment or a married couple based on the same last name or kin.

1374
02:14:57,492 --> 02:15:03,576
And that seems to have been, as I said, a continuous use all through up to the present time.

1375
02:15:04,396 --> 02:15:12,001
Supplementing the voting records, I've also provided a copy of a letter from a longtime tenant in

1376
02:15:13,663 --> 02:15:27,773
Natasha Merkulov, which is part of the package that I submitted, evidencing her statement that it's been used as a three-family for the entire time of her tenancy.

1377
02:15:29,014 --> 02:15:32,156
The property is actually laid out to function as a three-family.

1378
02:15:32,796 --> 02:15:38,240
There are three separate apartments, each with their separate means or two forms of egress.

1379
02:15:39,481 --> 02:15:41,602
each with their own kitchen, each with their own bathroom.

1380
02:15:42,462 --> 02:15:44,582
It's separately metered for utilities as well.

1381
02:15:46,383 --> 02:15:50,004
The file, oh, and two other things.

1382
02:15:50,684 --> 02:16:02,867
The assessor's record card shows that the property was constructed in 1910, so 15 years before the first zoning ordinance in Medford, and the assessor has it listed as a three-family.

1383
02:16:04,047 --> 02:16:17,575
When my client was buying the property, the smoke detector certificate that was issued by the fire department, the fee was charged for $150, which would be three times the $50 per unit rate.

1384
02:16:18,675 --> 02:16:26,920
So on a number of different city records, this property is recognized as a three-family, but not with the building department.

1385
02:16:28,601 --> 02:16:40,569
So when you go through the building department's records, you'll see various permits that were issued from time to time, but until January of this year, there had never been a certificate of occupancy.

1386
02:16:40,669 --> 02:16:45,212
So until January, the actual legal occupancy was in doubt.

1387
02:16:46,794 --> 02:16:54,599
And what we're asking you to do tonight is to find that this property is a preexisting non-conforming use.

1388
02:16:56,880 --> 02:17:25,849
When I read a relatively recent decision of the board, which is in the application filed by Richard Brown pertaining to 80 Canal Street, which was docket A2023-15, the board found that a four-unit residential dwelling in the GR zoning district was a preexisting nonconforming use.

1389
02:17:27,511 --> 02:17:38,908
And what particularly struck me about the board's decision in that case was the statement that the assessor's record showed that that use had existed for some time.

1390
02:17:40,009 --> 02:17:41,311
So it wasn't.

1391
02:17:42,052 --> 02:17:46,455
specifically tied to a particular version of the zoning ordinance.

1392
02:17:47,816 --> 02:17:56,941
And I think the rationale behind that is that it shows that the board has some flexibility in looking at these cases, excuse me, when

1393
02:17:58,762 --> 02:18:03,744
The record evidence, we're trying to figure out what was happening 100 years ago at the property.

1394
02:18:05,065 --> 02:18:12,227
And in some cases, there just isn't a voting registration book that I could find for 1924 or 1925.

1395
02:18:12,287 --> 02:18:14,728
So I can't tell you for certain what was going on in 1925.

1396
02:18:14,868 --> 02:18:15,169
I can for 1928.

1397
02:18:21,651 --> 02:18:32,905
And I think, you know, the board can make a reasonable inference that that was the same actual use of the property when the first zoning ordinance went into effect.

1398
02:18:35,149 --> 02:18:48,721
I do have a couple of comments on what I would refer to as policy arguments, not necessarily a legal argument, but one of the benefits that would come from granting the relief.

1399
02:18:49,842 --> 02:18:55,046
So the first is that, as I think we all hear and read,

1400
02:18:57,208 --> 02:19:00,129
The greater Boston area is having a bit of a housing crisis.

1401
02:19:01,190 --> 02:19:04,771
It's hard to find housing, particularly rental housing.

1402
02:19:06,112 --> 02:19:17,956
So by granting the relief sought by the petitioner in this case, you are really maintaining the status quo for this property that has existed for the last 96 years.

1403
02:19:19,497 --> 02:19:31,041
Denying that relief would subtract one unit of rental housing from Medford's rental housing inventory, which I would argue is a move in the wrong direction, given the context of the times.

1404
02:19:32,081 --> 02:19:37,803
The other policy argument is that when municipalities allow greater density,

1405
02:19:38,863 --> 02:19:41,226
It ideally should be transit oriented.

1406
02:19:42,327 --> 02:19:50,815
This property is a five minute walk from the intersection of North Street and Boston Avenue, which is a bus stop for three different MBTA bus lines.

1407
02:19:51,275 --> 02:19:59,163
So you'd be furthering that public policy goal of having a slightly greater density near public transit.

1408
02:20:04,108 --> 02:20:05,109
Give me just a second here.

1409
02:20:07,150 --> 02:20:20,277
Oh, I did submit architectural plans of what my client proposes to do at the site, as well as the existing conditions versus proposed conditions.

1410
02:20:20,978 --> 02:20:23,679
There's really not a lot that's going to change here.

1411
02:20:24,480 --> 02:20:31,224
There is going to be an addition at the rear of the building for a new series of decks and egress.

1412
02:20:32,704 --> 02:20:35,205
but that would not impact the rear yard setback.

1413
02:20:36,305 --> 02:20:45,567
It would extend the rear of the building by, I believe, eight feet, but it would still be more than 15 feet to the rear lot line.

1414
02:20:46,547 --> 02:20:54,309
The other thing, though, that is changing is that my client would be eliminating the side yard deck.

1415
02:20:55,649 --> 02:20:58,650
As you face the building from Orchard Street, that would be on the left-hand side.

1416
02:20:59,710 --> 02:21:13,235
That's a non-conformity now, but eliminating that deck would reduce the non-conformity and get the side yard set back, taking it from three feet, three and a half feet maybe, to 10 feet.

1417
02:21:13,495 --> 02:21:20,077
So that's an improvement, and we're decreasing an existing non-conformity by doing that.

1418
02:21:21,357 --> 02:21:47,528
So I would ask that the board, based on the preponderance of the evidence, find that this property qualifies as a legal non-conforming property and remand the matter back to the building commissioner to revise the certificate of occupancy that was issued in January to reflect that the property is a three-unit residential dwelling.

1419
02:21:49,923 --> 02:21:51,985
Oh, one last thing I forgot to add, I'm sorry.

1420
02:21:53,926 --> 02:21:58,770
I'm indebted to Michael Cohen, who is one of our participants today.

1421
02:21:59,491 --> 02:22:02,033
Michael is a real estate broker with Compass Realty.

1422
02:22:02,954 --> 02:22:12,242
He found, I believe, that there are 16 other three-family dwellings, legal nonconforming dwellings,

1423
02:22:12,782 --> 02:22:15,524
in this neighborhood, six of which are on Orchard Street.

1424
02:22:15,664 --> 02:22:20,646
So granting the requested relief would not be detrimental to the character of the neighborhood.

1425
02:22:21,307 --> 02:22:29,431
Um, it would not create any new burden on the city's, uh, health and safety and welfare concerns.

1426
02:22:30,191 --> 02:22:34,314
Uh, because basically, it's gonna be the same number of tenants that have been there for the last 100 years.

1427
02:22:38,236 --> 02:22:39,176
Thank you, Attorney Fitzsimmons.

1428
02:22:40,417 --> 02:22:42,418
Any questions from the board for the applicant?

1429
02:22:45,955 --> 02:22:46,215
Andrew?

1430
02:22:47,677 --> 02:22:48,237
Yeah, thank you.

1431
02:22:48,538 --> 02:22:52,482
You answered and provided a lot of information on questions that I might have otherwise had.

1432
02:22:52,802 --> 02:22:56,025
The one thing that you didn't address, though, is parking.

1433
02:22:56,126 --> 02:23:02,812
And I'm wondering, just from looking at the Google Maps, it looks pretty tight.

1434
02:23:02,872 --> 02:23:04,114
So how are you handling that?

1435
02:23:06,414 --> 02:23:09,357
I was speaking with my client about that.

1436
02:23:09,617 --> 02:23:22,487
He had indicated that he would like to, and Mr. McLaughlin is here, so he can nod his head yes or no if I'm not saying this correctly, but I think the intent is to add some additional parking.

1437
02:23:29,168 --> 02:23:39,532
We can get more specific on that when the application for the building permit is renewed with the building commissioner.

1438
02:23:40,612 --> 02:23:45,614
I'm really only speaking to the question of pre-existing non-conforming use tonight.

1439
02:23:57,698 --> 02:23:58,038
Commissioner?

1440
02:24:00,127 --> 02:24:07,453
I would argue that remanding it to the building department to reconsider it as a pre-existing non-conforming use may not be the proper avenue here.

1441
02:24:08,073 --> 02:24:17,140
You know, if the CFO was issued in January, they had their customary 30 days to appeal that as an administrative appeal of a decision of the building commissioner.

1442
02:24:18,201 --> 02:24:19,182
That was not done.

1443
02:24:19,442 --> 02:24:25,867
So they are here seeking a variance, which I think is the appropriate, and it is a different process and a different,

1444
02:24:27,725 --> 02:24:32,209
Conclusion at the end is the correct thing to be doing at this time, not to be remanding it.

1445
02:24:33,029 --> 02:24:34,070
I think that time has passed.

1446
02:24:35,491 --> 02:24:36,512
We can apply.

1447
02:24:44,038 --> 02:24:44,278
Mike.

1448
02:24:45,099 --> 02:24:47,100
Yeah, I threw you Jamie.

1449
02:24:47,180 --> 02:24:50,963
I just have a clarifying question for the commissioner on that.

1450
02:24:51,124 --> 02:24:51,564
So, um.

1451
02:24:55,582 --> 02:25:06,885
If I'm understanding you correctly, your position is that, or if I'm understanding the commissioner correctly, sorry, I'm trying to use right words.

1452
02:25:07,925 --> 02:25:14,627
The commissioner's position is that the certificate of occupancy stated

1453
02:25:16,244 --> 02:25:36,192
two family and even though other resources like the assessor's database and some of the historical information indicate that perhaps this was in fact a non-conforming three family at one point, that because

1454
02:25:37,679 --> 02:25:47,346
There was no administrative appeal within 30 days of the certificate of occupancy that said it's a two-family, that therefore...

1455
02:25:48,550 --> 02:25:59,520
whether or not that was a prior non-conforming use, now the only path forward for the applicant would be a variance because that 30-day period has lapsed.

1456
02:26:00,121 --> 02:26:00,481
Yes.

1457
02:26:01,082 --> 02:26:05,446
Yes, it gains standing as the final decision, essentially, after 30 days.

1458
02:26:05,546 --> 02:26:06,527
It's not appealed.

1459
02:26:06,647 --> 02:26:12,913
So now we have to entertain this all anew here a couple of months later, and a variance is the only open avenue I see

1460
02:26:13,553 --> 02:26:19,314
to consider creating a third use, which would make it conforming, not necessarily pre-existing non-conforming.

1461
02:26:20,015 --> 02:26:25,736
Each comes with its own baggage in terms of how he proceeds forward, but he is asking for a variance.

1462
02:26:25,776 --> 02:26:27,797
He's made it clear in his petition here.

1463
02:26:27,857 --> 02:26:32,638
So I don't think that's, his other recommendation is appropriate avenue to go.

1464
02:26:35,518 --> 02:26:38,379
I have one other question for the commissioner through the chair.

1465
02:26:38,399 --> 02:26:40,200
Is there a,

1466
02:26:42,810 --> 02:27:04,792
procedure by which the building department itself, outside of this administrative appeal period, might revise or reconsider a certificate of occupancy it issued such that a variance, if the building department chose to do so, would not be required.

1467
02:27:06,317 --> 02:27:12,760
Well, the challenge here is that a use does not have protection under the statutes of limitations unless it was granted by a permit.

1468
02:27:12,800 --> 02:27:15,421
There's no evidence that a permit was granted at any point.

1469
02:27:15,901 --> 02:27:20,083
There's also no evidence presented that the use was never vacated for a period of two years.

1470
02:27:20,523 --> 02:27:22,464
So we really don't know it's true history.

1471
02:27:22,904 --> 02:27:26,526
So, and I didn't make that decision does go back before my time.

1472
02:27:26,606 --> 02:27:33,929
So at this point, I will have to take it as the inspectors of the time viewed all of the evidence and made the best decision they could.

1473
02:27:33,989 --> 02:27:34,930
And that's what stands.

1474
02:27:35,852 --> 02:27:38,773
and it wasn't appealed, so we're going to look at this all brand new.

1475
02:27:38,793 --> 02:27:53,796
We certainly would consider it if somebody could bring us some level of information that meets the requirements, but it would take a heck of a lot more research, I think, versus going for the variance just to make it fully conforming at this time.

1476
02:27:55,077 --> 02:27:56,177
What if the board

1477
02:27:57,786 --> 02:28:14,958
found that prior to, and I'm not suggesting that we will, I'm just clarifying, what if the board found that prior to the issuance of this certificate of occupancy that this was in fact a non-conforming three-family?

1478
02:28:15,018 --> 02:28:26,567
Would that be evidence that would perhaps influence the building department in a decision whether or not to revise the certificate of occupancy?

1479
02:28:27,522 --> 02:28:27,842
It might.

1480
02:28:28,483 --> 02:28:33,686
That's a particular case I've never had to deal with in the past, but it could.

1481
02:28:33,846 --> 02:28:38,449
We might want to consult with KP Law before I make any final determinations.

1482
02:28:38,549 --> 02:28:40,270
Just it's a mucky issue.

1483
02:28:40,330 --> 02:28:41,270
I mean, it's a mucky issue.

1484
02:28:41,350 --> 02:28:42,431
It goes way back in time.

1485
02:28:42,511 --> 02:28:47,794
And as typical, the older they get, the less evidence there really is to stake toward it.

1486
02:28:48,315 --> 02:28:55,459
And unfortunately, the assessment records are based more around they'll tax what moves rather than conferring any sort of legality upon it.

1487
02:28:55,479 --> 02:28:56,860
So it's a mucky issue.

1488
02:28:57,921 --> 02:28:58,521
Okay, thank you.

1489
02:29:05,804 --> 02:29:07,724
Any other questions from the board for the applicant?

1490
02:29:08,385 --> 02:29:11,386
No.

1491
02:29:11,646 --> 02:29:12,286
Mr. McLaughlin.

1492
02:29:14,607 --> 02:29:14,867
Hi.

1493
02:29:15,887 --> 02:29:22,950
We had, when they did the certificate of occupancy, we had Jack Kenney come out on like December 26th.

1494
02:29:24,418 --> 02:29:33,024
And once he walked through, you know, he, you know, he verbally said, you know, everything that he could see was a legal tree family.

1495
02:29:33,764 --> 02:29:37,486
And then, you know, he said he had no issues with it as being a tree family.

1496
02:29:37,526 --> 02:29:45,952
And he thought because of the egress was so old and the plumbing and the third floor and the heating system was older, you know, that it was definitely a tree family.

1497
02:29:46,532 --> 02:29:50,335
And then in January, I think like January 12th, we had Dennis,

1498
02:29:51,855 --> 02:30:01,641
another building inspector come out to do a separate inspection and he talked to the tenant who was on the first floor and who had been there for like 34 years.

1499
02:30:02,682 --> 02:30:10,287
Dennis asked her, has it been a tree family and she told him she moved there 34 years ago and she lived in the third floor

1500
02:30:10,967 --> 02:30:15,009
for the first year, you know, or the first year living there.

1501
02:30:15,849 --> 02:30:32,896
And it was the same thing when he left the property, you know, he said, you know, Kevin, this is, you know, as far as we know, it's got everything, you know, it's got three heating systems, three electric meters, three hot water tanks, it's got the egress, it's got the smoke detectors.

1502
02:30:33,636 --> 02:30:35,778
You know, he said, as far as he says, it's got everything.

1503
02:30:35,798 --> 02:30:41,343
You know, he said, we're going to, you know, pretty much, you know, we can't say anything that's not a tree family.

1504
02:30:42,244 --> 02:30:46,548
So, you know, that's where we were at.

1505
02:30:46,608 --> 02:30:51,673
That's why we came here, you know, to the Zoning Board of Appeals.

1506
02:30:56,897 --> 02:30:57,438
Mike, go ahead.

1507
02:31:00,163 --> 02:31:23,112
Yeah, so this questions for the applicant, you may have spoken to a bit in your written application, but can you just speak to the so if this were to stay as a two family with the current certificate of occupancy, what what would that mean for the building?

1508
02:31:23,132 --> 02:31:25,713
What's the what's the hardship for you in that case?

1509
02:31:28,338 --> 02:31:44,752
Well, I think that the hardship is that, obviously, you need to make a lot of alterations at the building to sort of reverse this from a three-family to a two-unit apartment.

1510
02:31:47,180 --> 02:31:59,968
Obviously, there's the financial hardship, less rent, but there's also, as I said, the cost of undoing the current layout.

1511
02:32:01,008 --> 02:32:01,629
Okay, thank you.

1512
02:32:06,837 --> 02:32:25,938
Yeah, we have, sorry, the other issue was the parking and, you know, I talked with Dennis, the building inspector, and he was on the property and he said, you know, if it was granted, he said he wouldn't have an issue with the parking because the lot's shaped like a funnel lot, you know, because it's on a corner.

1513
02:32:26,920 --> 02:32:32,568
And there was like a good lot of extra space, you know, in the top corner.

1514
02:32:33,189 --> 02:32:37,616
And then the back of the property goes to the railroad track.

1515
02:32:38,116 --> 02:32:41,742
And it's the bridge that goes over on North Street.

1516
02:32:42,587 --> 02:32:54,149
So, you know, it's not even, you know, there's no butters really in the back and there is, you know, a good, you can probably park six cars, tandem parking, you know, in the back corner.

1517
02:32:54,429 --> 02:33:02,471
And then the next property next to that, sorry, the property next door, that's where the same people parked the car.

1518
02:33:02,491 --> 02:33:04,611
So it's going to be a driveway next to a driveway.

1519
02:33:05,531 --> 02:33:09,392
And the owner next door was all for, you know, we talked to him about it.

1520
02:33:10,975 --> 02:33:17,258
You know, we told him we were going for the variants and that, and he was like, good luck and, you know, hope you get it and everything.

1521
02:33:17,278 --> 02:33:18,719
It's always been a tree family.

1522
02:33:19,479 --> 02:33:26,963
You know, as far as he's lived there for a long time, he said he always thought it was a tree family.

1523
02:33:28,024 --> 02:33:29,124
That's what he thought it was.

1524
02:33:31,686 --> 02:33:32,546
Thank you, Mr. McLaughlin.

1525
02:33:33,667 --> 02:33:33,847
Chris?

1526
02:33:35,846 --> 02:33:37,467
Lou, thank you, Mr. Chair.

1527
02:33:38,027 --> 02:33:57,517
Yes, the applicant has just spoken to the point that I wanted to make and that Andre brought up earlier, which is that the neighbors may find that they're looking out onto a parking lot, but if they don't have a problem with it, then it seems like it's okay.

1528
02:33:59,798 --> 02:34:02,139
You know, that would be my concern is that

1529
02:34:03,823 --> 02:34:10,126
not the use, which seems to, and I know the neighborhood very well, the use probably does go back a hundred years.

1530
02:34:11,867 --> 02:34:22,933
It's that, you know, all of a sudden the whole lot is paved over and the neighbors are, you know, looking at a parking lot instead of a yard.

1531
02:34:25,274 --> 02:34:25,594
Thank you.

1532
02:34:27,795 --> 02:34:28,395
Thank you, Chris.

1533
02:34:29,756 --> 02:34:31,397
Any other questions from the board for the applicant?

1534
02:34:37,638 --> 02:34:38,819
I just have a question.

1535
02:34:39,119 --> 02:34:42,380
We've heard a couple of terms tossed around at the moment.

1536
02:34:43,480 --> 02:34:46,281
The application was documented as a finding.

1537
02:34:47,402 --> 02:34:50,823
And again, it may have been my misspoken.

1538
02:34:50,843 --> 02:34:52,483
I heard the statement of a variance.

1539
02:34:52,503 --> 02:34:53,744
I believe we're here for a finding.

1540
02:34:53,824 --> 02:34:54,304
Is that correct?

1541
02:34:56,085 --> 02:34:58,946
That's how the petition was filed.

1542
02:34:59,146 --> 02:34:59,386
Yes.

1543
02:35:01,987 --> 02:35:02,227
Thank you.

1544
02:35:03,332 --> 02:35:07,954
And I know Commissioner, you brought up the comment that we'll go into that further when we go to debate.

1545
02:35:09,475 --> 02:35:10,815
Just a question, Mr. Chair.

1546
02:35:11,235 --> 02:35:12,796
Thank you, Hunter.

1547
02:35:12,956 --> 02:35:14,016
I'm not sure.

1548
02:35:14,036 --> 02:35:17,178
One of the lawyers should try to clarify this.

1549
02:35:18,633 --> 02:35:34,221
So procedurally, it seems like we will consider a finding, and then based on that finding, also vote on a variance or just one or the other.

1550
02:35:37,843 --> 02:35:43,546
I believe to Mike's earlier comment or question to the commissioner,

1551
02:35:45,874 --> 02:35:59,596
and we can discuss this as we go into today, is approaching this as a finding that the property has been legally nonconforming three family prior to the certificate of occupancy.

1552
02:36:03,057 --> 02:36:03,237
Mike?

1553
02:36:03,817 --> 02:36:05,157
Yes, if I may.

1554
02:36:05,978 --> 02:36:12,619
So my understanding from what the building commissioner shared is that

1555
02:36:14,795 --> 02:36:25,738
his position is the only surefire way to grant the relief being sought here is to pursue a variance.

1556
02:36:25,898 --> 02:36:32,739
So it's within the board's powers to issue findings on a variety of matters.

1557
02:36:34,560 --> 02:36:35,820
The commissioner

1558
02:36:36,921 --> 02:36:48,220
pointed out that we're outside of the administrative appeal period, and so if the board were to issue a finding merely

1559
02:36:50,860 --> 02:36:55,742
remanding it back to the building department, there would be potential procedural issues there.

1560
02:36:55,862 --> 02:37:00,484
So that's when I started asking the questions about other types of findings we could make.

1561
02:37:00,584 --> 02:37:02,945
So I do think there's a procedural question.

1562
02:37:03,105 --> 02:37:13,609
If a variance is the relief needed, and this was noticed as a finding, maybe today the only thing we could do is issue some sort of finding.

1563
02:37:16,811 --> 02:37:17,251
But yeah.

1564
02:37:19,068 --> 02:37:29,735
Commissioner pointed out something that may indicate a finding is inadequate to provide the full desired relief in this case.

1565
02:37:30,916 --> 02:37:31,236
Right.

1566
02:37:31,276 --> 02:37:45,005
That sort of gets to my question as what is, you know, we could make a finding and therefore on the basis of that finding grant the variance or whether one precludes the other.

1567
02:37:45,065 --> 02:37:46,246
That's really my question.

1568
02:37:50,415 --> 02:37:53,298
Well, I don't think that it would preclude it.

1569
02:37:54,599 --> 02:38:04,529
And I guess, you know, I would defer to the board and the board's counsel as to the correct procedural path.

1570
02:38:05,390 --> 02:38:08,873
But if the building commissioners of the opinion that a variance

1571
02:38:09,919 --> 02:38:12,282
is really what needs to be done.

1572
02:38:12,583 --> 02:38:20,433
I think we could ask that the board grant a variance based on finding that it's a pre-existing non-conforming use.

1573
02:38:25,626 --> 02:38:43,533
And I would just add to that, I mean, it's a little different from the typical variance test that was articulated earlier in the first case that you had by Mr. Caldara that, you know, we're really talking so much about topography or soil conditions or dimensions of the lot specific to the lot.

1574
02:38:44,413 --> 02:38:53,997
It's more of a determination that this has been a three-family since more or less since the time that it was built and predates zoning.

1575
02:38:55,582 --> 02:38:56,942
appointed information.

1576
02:38:57,663 --> 02:39:00,363
So I'm looking at the agenda now.

1577
02:39:00,783 --> 02:39:06,005
It appears this was noticed as a variance.

1578
02:39:06,205 --> 02:39:14,727
So the board actually could proceed with analysis on whether or not to grant a variance.

1579
02:39:15,867 --> 02:39:19,488
And then findings, I mean, we can, findings don't need to be noticed.

1580
02:39:19,508 --> 02:39:23,389
We can find on a variety of topics without that being noticed.

1581
02:39:25,405 --> 02:39:26,567
Thank you for pointing that out, Mike.

1582
02:39:27,989 --> 02:39:28,410
Commissioner?

1583
02:39:29,412 --> 02:39:37,705
I will note that under, I think it's section 94.11.42, powers of the board, you are empowered to consider and grant a use variance.

1584
02:39:37,865 --> 02:39:38,727
So use variance is

1585
02:39:40,902 --> 02:39:41,522
this per case.

1586
02:39:42,002 --> 02:39:54,845
Bear in mind there are some differences between a variance making this a fully conforming structure and not subject to any limitations that might be imposed upon a pre-existing non-conforming structure.

1587
02:39:55,145 --> 02:40:00,566
They are subtly different than they have some different pluses and minuses.

1588
02:40:00,626 --> 02:40:03,726
If you're leading towards a variance that probably is the best choice.

1589
02:40:03,806 --> 02:40:07,227
It certainly would make it fully conforming and not a subject of

1590
02:40:08,144 --> 02:40:13,348
any restrictions that pre-existing non-conforming uses instructors may have upon them.

1591
02:40:14,049 --> 02:40:17,332
So it has its upsides as well.

1592
02:40:22,316 --> 02:40:23,236
Thank you for catching that, Mike.

1593
02:40:23,256 --> 02:40:25,558
That was my concern was a procedural with the notice.

1594
02:40:25,838 --> 02:40:29,301
So we have noticed that the variance would be considered.

1595
02:40:29,321 --> 02:40:31,103
Mr. McLaughlin.

1596
02:40:33,530 --> 02:40:47,075
Yeah, I mean, one other thing was that whenever we did get the certificate of occupancy, or sorry, whenever they did the walkthroughs, it was near the end of the temporary building commissioner.

1597
02:40:47,095 --> 02:40:56,479
You know, he was like, you can probably just see what happens with the new gang, you know, to see if, you know, it's okay by the building department.

1598
02:40:56,499 --> 02:41:02,541
And that was probably part of the delay where we were just, you know, looking for more for approval from the building commissioner.

1599
02:41:03,181 --> 02:41:06,883
than we were for like filing, you know, inside the 30 days.

1600
02:41:06,903 --> 02:41:16,588
Thank you.

1601
02:41:17,088 --> 02:41:19,189
So I believe that this, go ahead, Andrew.

1602
02:41:19,489 --> 02:41:23,031
Yeah, I'd just like to make a motion to open for public comment.

1603
02:41:24,131 --> 02:41:27,273
Thank you.

1604
02:41:28,234 --> 02:41:29,194
Roll call vote.

1605
02:41:29,254 --> 02:41:29,774
Andrew, in the room.

1606
02:41:30,895 --> 02:41:30,975
Aye.

1607
02:41:32,858 --> 02:41:33,298
Mary Lee.

1608
02:41:37,159 --> 02:41:37,239
Aye.

1609
02:41:37,259 --> 02:41:38,940
Yvette Velez.

1610
02:41:40,080 --> 02:41:40,220
Aye.

1611
02:41:41,220 --> 02:41:41,780
Mike Caldera.

1612
02:41:42,500 --> 02:41:42,620
Aye.

1613
02:41:43,601 --> 02:41:44,221
Jamie Thompson.

1614
02:41:44,421 --> 02:41:46,201
Aye.

1615
02:41:46,241 --> 02:41:50,903
We are open for public comment if anybody would like to speak to this project.

1616
02:41:52,103 --> 02:41:58,905
And you can email Dennis McDougall at dmcdougall at mentra-ma.gov.

1617
02:41:58,925 --> 02:42:00,165
We'll give that just a minute.

1618
02:42:00,715 --> 02:42:02,095
see if anybody submits anything.

1619
02:42:02,215 --> 02:42:04,096
I do not see any hands raised at this time.

1620
02:42:26,521 --> 02:42:28,161
Motion to close public hearings.

1621
02:42:31,785 --> 02:42:35,447
make the front and then close the public hearing and open deliberation.

1622
02:42:40,329 --> 02:42:42,009
And I'll second it.

1623
02:42:42,029 --> 02:42:47,411
I see you're under a second you're just on mute.

1624
02:42:48,832 --> 02:42:49,652
Yeah, no, I was.

1625
02:42:50,733 --> 02:42:51,173
Absolutely.

1626
02:42:51,353 --> 02:42:51,613
Yes.

1627
02:42:52,474 --> 02:42:53,994
Thank you.

1628
02:42:54,234 --> 02:42:56,235
Mary Lee.

1629
02:42:56,255 --> 02:42:59,356
I met the list.

1630
02:42:59,376 --> 02:43:00,937
I make Caldera.

1631
02:43:04,195 --> 02:43:14,122
I. Jamie Thompson, I. So, it looks, I believe the conversation right now is for a variance in this case.

1632
02:43:17,664 --> 02:43:18,585
What does everybody think.

1633
02:43:30,006 --> 02:43:38,213
I do find it compelling that the property was built as and has been occupied as a three-family.

1634
02:43:38,233 --> 02:43:54,467
I do think given the fact that it's already got all the utilities and infrastructure there for it, I do think that it would be a hardship to limit it to a two-family and would be inclined to

1635
02:43:55,645 --> 02:44:07,692
just for the record, make a finding that it is a pre-existing non-conforming three-family, and then we grant the use variance to formalize it as a three-family.

1636
02:44:11,635 --> 02:44:11,995
Thank you.

1637
02:44:12,175 --> 02:44:12,715
That makes sense.

1638
02:44:14,816 --> 02:44:15,257
Anyone else?

1639
02:44:21,380 --> 02:44:21,561
Mike?

1640
02:44:22,701 --> 02:44:23,081
Yeah.

1641
02:44:24,632 --> 02:44:33,858
Generally in agreement with Andre, so here it's the configuration of the structure itself.

1642
02:44:33,998 --> 02:44:35,880
It's already set up as a

1643
02:44:39,621 --> 02:44:55,039
three-family and it appears to have been used as such for some time to the point at which there are some signals, although not with legal force, that even Medford considered it to be a three-family.

1644
02:44:55,179 --> 02:44:59,204
And so a literal enforcement of the law

1645
02:45:00,069 --> 02:45:10,154
The ordinance, now that it has unfortunately lost that status for administrative reasons, would involve substantial hardship.

1646
02:45:10,194 --> 02:45:15,356
It would be a costly reconfiguration of this existing structure.

1647
02:45:19,240 --> 02:45:33,013
It seems that we could grant this relief without substantial detriment to the public good because this building has been seemingly functioning as a three family for quite some time.

1648
02:45:33,033 --> 02:45:38,138
And so, yeah, I agree with Andre on this one.

1649
02:45:39,980 --> 02:45:40,500
Thank you, Becky.

1650
02:45:42,182 --> 02:45:43,523
Anything else?

1651
02:45:43,603 --> 02:45:44,344
Anyone else from the board?

1652
02:45:49,597 --> 02:45:50,997
All right, Chair awaits a motion.

1653
02:45:56,819 --> 02:45:59,940
Motion to, I assume we have to make two motions here.

1654
02:45:59,980 --> 02:46:10,803
The first one would be for, to make a finding that this property is a non-conforming, pre-existing non-conforming three-family residence.

1655
02:46:12,063 --> 02:46:13,783
Procedurally, I think that would be the right call.

1656
02:46:17,375 --> 02:46:27,900
I'm less convinced because I agree with the building commissioner's accounting of events.

1657
02:46:27,960 --> 02:46:38,005
And so if there was an appeals period that lapsed, even if it lapsed with good intention, then it lost that status.

1658
02:46:38,045 --> 02:46:44,228
So we would be risking making a finding of fact that is actually factually

1659
02:46:45,602 --> 02:46:48,243
not the case from a legal perspective anymore.

1660
02:46:49,303 --> 02:46:53,525
And it's not a necessary step in granting the relief.

1661
02:46:53,585 --> 02:47:01,627
So if the board approves the variance, then it's moot whether it was non-conforming three-family.

1662
02:47:02,507 --> 02:47:05,308
And it's also moot whether it is non-conforming three-family.

1663
02:47:05,388 --> 02:47:13,731
It will then become a, by variance, I guess, conforming three-family.

1664
02:47:15,670 --> 02:47:20,314
Okay, I just want to check with the applicant since the application was filled as a finding.

1665
02:47:20,694 --> 02:47:25,478
Attorney Fitzsimmons, are you comfortable with us moving forward only with the variance?

1666
02:47:25,978 --> 02:47:29,341
Yes, we'd be glad to convert this into a request for a variance.

1667
02:47:30,662 --> 02:47:31,583
Okay, thank you.

1668
02:47:33,284 --> 02:47:37,567
I'd like to withdraw my motion and offer a new motion.

1669
02:47:37,587 --> 02:47:40,309
You don't have to, it wasn't seconded.

1670
02:47:40,329 --> 02:47:41,350
Okay.

1671
02:47:44,192 --> 02:47:44,853
Go ahead.

1672
02:47:46,362 --> 02:47:51,866
I'd like to motion that we find the 86 Orchard Street.

1673
02:47:54,308 --> 02:47:59,692
We offer them a use variance as a three-family residential.

1674
02:48:02,113 --> 02:48:02,414
Second.

1675
02:48:02,434 --> 02:48:04,895
All right.

1676
02:48:04,996 --> 02:48:06,477
Roll call vote.

1677
02:48:06,557 --> 02:48:07,117
Yvette Valez?

1678
02:48:08,258 --> 02:48:08,398
Aye.

1679
02:48:09,839 --> 02:48:10,419
Mike Calderon?

1680
02:48:11,280 --> 02:48:11,420
Aye.

1681
02:48:12,621 --> 02:48:13,121
Andrew Leroux?

1682
02:48:13,902 --> 02:48:14,042
Aye.

1683
02:48:15,023 --> 02:48:15,383
Mary Lee?

1684
02:48:16,740 --> 02:48:21,824
I. And Jamie Thompson, I. Thank you, Attorney Fitzsimmons.

1685
02:48:22,565 --> 02:48:28,270
If you could, could you provide a draft for us to review and finalize?

1686
02:48:29,391 --> 02:48:29,711
Certainly.

1687
02:48:31,112 --> 02:48:31,392
Thank you.

1688
02:48:32,393 --> 02:48:32,733
Thank you.

1689
02:48:40,220 --> 02:48:42,081
Dennis, we're good for the next one.

1690
02:48:45,057 --> 02:48:46,779
178 Fulton Street, case number A-2024-09.

1691
02:48:46,819 --> 02:49:02,634
Applicant and owner, James Reed, was petitioning for a variance in Chapter 94, City of Memphis Zoning, to install a new curb, cut, and driveway in the front yard of the property at 178 Fulton Street, which is not allowed per the City of Memphis Zoning Ordinance, Chapter 94, Section 6.1.4, Subset 3.

1692
02:49:08,339 --> 02:49:09,701
Do we have a representative for the applicant?

1693
02:49:10,890 --> 02:49:13,472
Yes, good evening members of the board.

1694
02:49:14,213 --> 02:49:20,598
My name is Henry Rapa and I'm appearing on behalf of James Reed and his wife.

1695
02:49:22,180 --> 02:49:25,803
With respect to this and as of tomorrow at this time, hopefully a newborn baby.

1696
02:49:29,253 --> 02:49:30,394
So congratulations.

1697
02:49:31,155 --> 02:49:33,037
Yes, very exciting time for them.

1698
02:49:33,858 --> 02:49:37,241
So what we have here, I don't know how much you've reviewed the materials.

1699
02:49:37,281 --> 02:49:41,826
This is hopefully much simpler than some of the ones you've had this evening.

1700
02:49:42,647 --> 02:49:49,313
What we have here is the property is upon Fulton Street on a downward curve.

1701
02:49:50,370 --> 02:50:01,580
So entering, exiting the property, it's a significant risk of safety to the occupants of the property and also those pedestrians or motorists on Fulton Street.

1702
02:50:02,621 --> 02:50:12,589
In our petition, we've included three pictures that actually show what it looks like as one would access the street.

1703
02:50:14,231 --> 02:50:16,252
There's also a letter of support from a neighbor

1704
02:50:17,288 --> 02:50:23,278
stating the risk of entering, exiting the property with its current configuration.

1705
02:50:23,819 --> 02:50:29,569
So the requested relief would allow my clients to have an ability to access to

1706
02:50:31,522 --> 02:50:40,009
move through ST Francis S Fulton Street in a much s of where is on the downw

1707
02:50:51,032 --> 02:50:55,115
One of the letters of support states that the previous owner never even used the existing driveway.

1708
02:50:55,135 --> 02:51:06,080
And I'm pretty confident that my client would be concerned about using the existing driveway in its configuration once they're backing out of that driveway with a car seat with a baby in the back.

1709
02:51:07,158 --> 02:51:12,602
So the lot itself creates a hardship for various purposes.

1710
02:51:13,182 --> 02:51:29,093
And obviously the public good would be served by having both the occupants of the home, motorists and pedestrians on Fulton Street protected from an alternate access route that is going to significantly decrease any risk to the parties.

1711
02:51:30,228 --> 02:51:38,971
and would also be reducing some congestion on the street by allowing a vehicle in the yard to be parked in the driveway.

1712
02:51:39,731 --> 02:51:51,955
So our position is that the public good is served, and there's certainly no detriment to the bylaw, because the bylaws, as you all know, is to protect safety and reduce congestion.

1713
02:51:52,195 --> 02:51:54,796
So this relief would

1714
02:51:55,697 --> 02:51:59,540
be beneficial to not only my client, but also the neighborhood in general.

1715
02:52:00,401 --> 02:52:10,749
It would provide safety and it would certainly eliminate the risk of a severe crash backing out onto Fulton Street on the downward curve area.

1716
02:52:16,213 --> 02:52:18,795
I don't know if the board has any questions for me on this.

1717
02:52:20,096 --> 02:52:21,857
Thank you, Mr. Abbott.

1718
02:52:21,957 --> 02:52:22,818
Any questions from the board?

1719
02:52:26,367 --> 02:52:29,048
Yeah, I noticed that on St.

1720
02:52:29,248 --> 02:52:35,489
Francis Street, there's a fire hydrant and a telephone pole on that side.

1721
02:52:35,509 --> 02:52:41,470
I'm just wondering if they're going to be affected at all.

1722
02:52:43,711 --> 02:52:44,331
I would say no.

1723
02:52:44,911 --> 02:52:45,891
I did a site visit.

1724
02:52:46,371 --> 02:52:47,431
I'm looking at the plan.

1725
02:52:47,791 --> 02:52:55,253
Neither of those things look like they're not affected from what his construction was going to be, and I can't see in any way, shape, or form

1726
02:52:56,788 --> 02:52:59,789
the hydrant or the pole being impacted by the requested relief.

1727
02:53:04,910 --> 02:53:05,230
Thank you.

1728
02:53:05,770 --> 02:53:06,110
Thank you.

1729
02:53:09,651 --> 02:53:09,911
Mike?

1730
02:53:10,712 --> 02:53:14,012
Yeah, just double checking my understanding.

1731
02:53:16,173 --> 02:53:20,634
So because this is a corner lot, am I correct that the existing

1732
02:53:23,714 --> 02:53:38,841
driveway with its existing unused or underused parking space, if that didn't exist and you had a driveway going to the other side, that actually this would also be parking in the front yard to add the existing driveway?

1733
02:53:41,038 --> 02:53:42,699
Well, the existing driveway is already there.

1734
02:53:42,939 --> 02:53:44,180
Yeah, but if it weren't there.

1735
02:53:44,220 --> 02:53:53,607
So basically, like I'm trying to understand if what you're asking to do here is fundamentally different than what the existing driveway at the time was doing.

1736
02:53:54,868 --> 02:53:55,989
Oh, I see what you're saying.

1737
02:53:56,249 --> 02:54:09,179
Yeah, well, I think, you know, in light of the fact that Fulton Street is a fairly high volume traffic street, and in light of the fact that the previous owner wasn't even using the driveway, and my clients have a very

1738
02:54:10,205 --> 02:54:13,027
and the ability to really utilize it to its strength.

1739
02:54:13,128 --> 02:54:25,638
This provides for use of a driveway to provide parking for the house that isn't really going to exist without the relief.

1740
02:54:26,459 --> 02:54:27,640
I would say if the board

1741
02:54:28,554 --> 02:54:39,764
didn't grant relief, they'd probably be forced to be keeping a car on the street somewhere because I think they're going to be relatively concerned about backing out onto that street with a car seat with a child in the back.

1742
02:54:39,824 --> 02:54:46,289
I know when I first had my kids, I was terrified backing out to a street that had nobody traversing it.

1743
02:54:46,469 --> 02:54:49,972
So I can only imagine that as a new parent on a busy street what they're going to feel.

1744
02:54:52,943 --> 02:55:01,051
I think the way the plan was drawn, it was to provide them the access they need for their benefit as well as those people in the neighborhood.

1745
02:55:03,193 --> 02:55:03,654
OK, thank you.

1746
02:55:04,254 --> 02:55:04,595
Thank you.

1747
02:55:10,561 --> 02:55:11,662
Any other questions from the board?

1748
02:55:19,553 --> 02:55:20,093
All right.

1749
02:55:20,353 --> 02:55:22,754
Chair waits motion to open for public comment.

1750
02:55:26,855 --> 02:55:29,035
I'll motion to open public comment.

1751
02:55:34,216 --> 02:55:34,756
Can I get a second?

1752
02:55:35,356 --> 02:55:35,877
Seconded.

1753
02:55:37,117 --> 02:55:37,537
Thank you.

1754
02:55:39,717 --> 02:55:40,298
Annette Gilles?

1755
02:55:41,438 --> 02:55:41,538
Aye.

1756
02:55:42,658 --> 02:55:43,118
Mary Lee?

1757
02:55:44,498 --> 02:55:44,618
Aye.

1758
02:55:45,779 --> 02:55:46,299
Andrea LaRue?

1759
02:55:46,979 --> 02:55:47,079
Aye.

1760
02:55:48,046 --> 02:55:48,826
Mike Gelder?

1761
02:55:49,506 --> 02:55:49,646
Aye.

1762
02:55:50,527 --> 02:55:51,147
Jamie Thompson?

1763
02:55:51,227 --> 02:55:53,748
Aye.

1764
02:55:53,848 --> 02:55:58,049
Any comments from the public on 178 Fulton Street?

1765
02:56:00,830 --> 02:56:05,911
You may email Dennis McDougal at dmcdougal at medford-ma.gov.

1766
02:56:08,072 --> 02:56:09,432
Give that just a moment.

1767
02:56:24,048 --> 02:56:25,088
I don't see any hand raised.

1768
02:56:25,188 --> 02:56:26,389
Dennis, do you have anything in the mail?

1769
02:56:37,851 --> 02:56:38,812
Sorry, an email came in.

1770
02:56:38,852 --> 02:56:40,552
It wasn't for this, and it threw me for a bit.

1771
02:56:40,652 --> 02:56:42,052
No, we've got no emails.

1772
02:56:43,233 --> 02:56:43,853
Thank you, Dennis.

1773
02:56:44,453 --> 02:56:48,374
I motion to close the public portion of the hearing and under deliberation.

1774
02:56:51,014 --> 02:56:51,515
Seconded.

1775
02:56:53,075 --> 02:56:53,375
Thank you.

1776
02:56:55,633 --> 02:56:57,976
Under the roof.

1777
02:56:57,996 --> 02:57:01,179
Hi.

1778
02:57:01,199 --> 02:57:02,741
Hi.

1779
02:57:03,401 --> 02:57:03,522
Hi.

1780
02:57:04,623 --> 02:57:05,063
Mary Lee.

1781
02:57:06,685 --> 02:57:06,725
Hi.

1782
02:57:07,726 --> 02:57:08,527
And Jamie Thompson.

1783
02:57:08,627 --> 02:57:08,727
Hi.

1784
02:57:10,329 --> 02:57:11,470
Right for the board.

1785
02:57:12,011 --> 02:57:15,935
That's on the driveway for 178 Fulton Street.

1786
02:57:25,583 --> 02:57:27,585
Andrew?

1787
02:57:28,505 --> 02:57:29,806
So just a couple of thoughts.

1788
02:57:29,826 --> 02:57:36,152
So one, I never love putting asphalt in front yards.

1789
02:57:37,713 --> 02:57:43,157
That being said, I don't see public detriment to it.

1790
02:57:43,217 --> 02:57:50,844
I understand the safety concern with pulling out onto a safer street around that corner and on a busy road.

1791
02:57:54,668 --> 02:57:58,510
So the case could be made for hardship.

1792
02:58:00,331 --> 02:58:21,722
I would probably like to, if we do grant the variance, I would like to condition it so that the fire hydrant and the utility pole are, this could only be done if the fire hydrant and utility pole are unaffected by the construction and the curb cut.

1793
02:58:24,963 --> 02:58:39,426
that they maintain the area around the corner appropriately landscaped to allow for high site level viewing across the corner.

1794
02:58:45,627 --> 02:58:46,587
Thank you.

1795
02:58:48,928 --> 02:58:50,088
Any other comments from the board?

1796
02:58:59,821 --> 02:59:19,008
So for me, I understand the hardship and the need, not really thrilled with the plan as proposed, like this whole double curb cut, the kind of awkward angle driveway that doesn't really connect to the house.

1797
02:59:19,248 --> 02:59:25,910
It's like, it just, it feels like there's probably a better way to achieve

1798
02:59:27,589 --> 02:59:35,995
but I don't really have the know-how or expertise to suggest what that change would be.

1799
02:59:36,055 --> 02:59:41,578
And I think it does, it would have the result of dragging things out for the applicant.

1800
02:59:41,638 --> 02:59:48,783
So I don't really like the layout, but understand the hardship and I think I could get behind it.

1801
02:59:48,803 --> 02:59:54,767
I agree, it's not like a big detriment to the public good.

1802
02:59:57,522 --> 03:00:01,585
I guess, was this going back to your comment about the parking in the front yard?

1803
03:00:02,806 --> 03:00:06,349
Well, that was more of a curiosity question.

1804
03:00:06,929 --> 03:00:12,073
I do think the lot is such that parking will be in the front yard.

1805
03:00:12,333 --> 03:00:15,435
I asked a question I almost was certain I knew the answer to.

1806
03:00:15,475 --> 03:00:19,258
But no matter where it's located, it's going to be front yard parking.

1807
03:00:21,620 --> 03:00:25,983
And currently, the parking is this really narrow thing on a busy street.

1808
03:00:28,060 --> 03:00:35,422
I think having a driveway on the less busy street where you can actually park a modern vehicle makes sense.

1809
03:00:36,062 --> 03:00:41,884
But yeah, as proposed, it's like this double driveway with really weird angles.

1810
03:00:47,545 --> 03:00:47,925
Commissioner?

1811
03:00:49,546 --> 03:00:53,747
I would like to say that because it involves a curb cut,

1812
03:00:54,447 --> 03:01:02,709
And because it involves potentially increasing impermeable surface area, this will have to be dealt with through the DPW as well.

1813
03:01:03,009 --> 03:01:05,070
Stormwater regulations come into play.

1814
03:01:05,770 --> 03:01:16,853
If you decide to prove it, I might put a condition on that sense that it is acceptable to the extent that the design gets tweaked by DPW to meet their own considerations.

1815
03:01:17,813 --> 03:01:21,934
So it doesn't invite the applicant to have to come back for a minor adjustment.

1816
03:01:22,878 --> 03:01:29,961
just a thought, but I expect that it goes to DPW and they may make their own changes to the exact layout for their own needs.

1817
03:01:31,242 --> 03:01:35,284
Just address that if you could in any decision if you choose to.

1818
03:01:35,304 --> 03:01:40,766
I know.

1819
03:01:42,387 --> 03:01:43,787
I think we've talked about that.

1820
03:01:43,867 --> 03:01:48,409
We can't condition something on approval for another board because we're approving.

1821
03:01:48,430 --> 03:01:51,351
You're conditioning.

1822
03:01:52,465 --> 03:01:54,767
Well, you're conditioning to allow it to exist.

1823
03:01:56,168 --> 03:02:04,776
You can't, you know, that's what you're basically given the right to put a curb cut and a parking space in the front yard, because that's what they're looking for exemption from.

1824
03:02:05,096 --> 03:02:07,318
The language says you shall not park in the front yard.

1825
03:02:07,358 --> 03:02:08,479
So you can give them that.

1826
03:02:08,800 --> 03:02:12,523
The final layout itself may be determined by others.

1827
03:02:12,543 --> 03:02:16,727
So you're saying your perspective is conditioning at that.

1828
03:02:19,798 --> 03:02:23,160
so that any changes by the DPW don't need to come back to us.

1829
03:02:23,721 --> 03:02:35,469
Right, you're granting them the right to have parking in the front yard as an exception to the bylaw as written with the understanding that final design considerations may be subject to review by the DPW or something like that.

1830
03:02:35,569 --> 03:02:38,771
I don't think that necessarily derogates from that expectation.

1831
03:02:38,811 --> 03:02:43,655
You're not predicating your decision to give them this use based on a decision to be made by others.

1832
03:02:44,328 --> 03:02:47,671
You're giving them the use, you're just leaving some design changes.

1833
03:02:48,031 --> 03:02:58,460
Like a conservation commission meeting, you might approve a site plan or something, but you know that they're going to have some sort of other little adjustments to be made that are really critical to you.

1834
03:02:59,881 --> 03:03:00,102
Got it.

1835
03:03:00,322 --> 03:03:00,842
That makes sense.

1836
03:03:01,142 --> 03:03:01,503
Thank you.

1837
03:03:07,188 --> 03:03:08,088
I have a question.

1838
03:03:08,108 --> 03:03:09,009
Anybody else?

1839
03:03:09,089 --> 03:03:09,510
Go ahead.

1840
03:03:09,590 --> 03:03:10,951
I have a clarifying.

1841
03:03:12,000 --> 03:03:16,482
So it's one parking spot they currently have, and they're getting two, essentially, right?

1842
03:03:16,562 --> 03:03:18,623
Because they're getting this curb cut in the round court.

1843
03:03:19,904 --> 03:03:21,804
But we're taking one away from the public.

1844
03:03:22,165 --> 03:03:26,326
But they're saying, oh, that's because they're still going to have two cars.

1845
03:03:26,386 --> 03:03:28,487
So it's just them going to be parking on the street.

1846
03:03:29,108 --> 03:03:31,969
Because they don't use their, they can't use their garage.

1847
03:03:32,009 --> 03:03:33,390
There's no longer a garage.

1848
03:03:35,511 --> 03:03:36,171
Is that what it was?

1849
03:03:39,742 --> 03:03:52,191
So their driveway currently exits onto Fulton Street, and they're challenged getting in and out of that due to the busyness of Fulton Street and the concern for safety.

1850
03:03:53,371 --> 03:03:56,834
This would add a pathway for them to come out onto St.

1851
03:03:56,894 --> 03:03:57,594
Francis Street.

1852
03:03:59,255 --> 03:03:59,536
Right.

1853
03:03:59,696 --> 03:04:02,117
And could potentially provide additional parking for them.

1854
03:04:02,137 --> 03:04:02,718
That's correct.

1855
03:04:03,258 --> 03:04:07,001
But you're taking one away from the public, and the argument was,

1856
03:04:08,319 --> 03:04:11,420
but they still park on the street as well, right?

1857
03:04:11,460 --> 03:04:12,560
Was that what I had heard?

1858
03:04:14,220 --> 03:04:25,223
If I may interject, they would not need to park on the street if the board were granting the variance because they would have enough parking off street.

1859
03:04:25,423 --> 03:04:33,065
And that would be part of the benefit to the public at large is that there wouldn't be vehicles from this house on the street.

1860
03:04:33,765 --> 03:04:38,046
That would be the ultimate benefit of granting the relief.

1861
03:04:39,767 --> 03:04:44,509
And have you put mirrors, though, and things of that nature that would help with?

1862
03:04:45,929 --> 03:05:00,434
I guess I'm also struggling with similar to what Mike is talking about, putting a big slab of asphalt across the way and then the way it comes out into the street.

1863
03:05:09,019 --> 03:05:24,304
But I also understand and hear that clearly the Department of Public Works will be part of this conversation, so they would help mitigate what that would look like.

1864
03:05:26,965 --> 03:05:37,688
Then again, I'm struggling too with the whole you're taking a parking spot away from the public on that side of the street because people could still park there right after that hydrant.

1865
03:05:38,597 --> 03:05:43,880
Well, that is true, but it could be my clients parking on that street, and they're not going to be doing that now.

1866
03:05:44,341 --> 03:05:56,549
So I think there really isn't a loss, because what would be happening is my clients would not be using on-street parking.

1867
03:05:57,630 --> 03:06:03,453
And there was no asking of signage, and there was no inputting of a mirror.

1868
03:06:04,254 --> 03:06:05,595
Nothing else has been done to help.

1869
03:06:06,993 --> 03:06:11,997
increase safety previous to this or things have been done and it hasn't worked out?

1870
03:06:12,457 --> 03:06:21,204
Well, I just think the only way to get out in that street is to back out the street from that existing driveway and it's on a downhill curve.

1871
03:06:23,046 --> 03:06:24,167
There really isn't anything.

1872
03:06:25,687 --> 03:06:31,669
that would make the view easier or better for the person exiting the driveway or the person coming down the hill.

1873
03:06:32,209 --> 03:06:39,212
And for that reason, I've seen a letter from a neighbor supporting saying that the previous owner never even used the driveway.

1874
03:06:39,812 --> 03:06:51,376
So what we're doing here is increasing the ability of the homeowner to use off-street parking and protect the safety of them and others.

1875
03:06:53,008 --> 03:06:55,589
And the yard around the driveway is going to be landscaped.

1876
03:06:56,089 --> 03:07:08,892
So that would mitigate the... The front yard is still going to have landscaping, absent, of course, the driveway area, but it would be landscaped overall in the front yard.

1877
03:07:08,912 --> 03:07:14,313
So it's not like it's all going to be paved and all of a sudden you're going to have this big paved area out there.

1878
03:07:14,333 --> 03:07:15,593
It would just be the driveway area.

1879
03:07:22,512 --> 03:07:27,057
I just want to know currently if they've reversed into the spot.

1880
03:07:27,157 --> 03:07:31,962
Is that not possible at all to be reversing into the spot?

1881
03:07:33,103 --> 03:07:33,683
I would say no.

1882
03:07:34,104 --> 03:07:35,285
I visited the street.

1883
03:07:35,986 --> 03:07:40,310
I visited the property, I believe, on two occasions at different times.

1884
03:07:40,670 --> 03:07:45,835
To back into that driveway would require someone on the downward slope

1885
03:07:46,948 --> 03:07:49,409
backing in as cars come down the street.

1886
03:07:50,729 --> 03:07:51,810
It would be very risky.

1887
03:07:51,870 --> 03:07:55,551
And I would think it, I certainly wouldn't do it.

1888
03:07:55,571 --> 03:08:09,236
I don't think many people would, and particularly a family with a young child, the risk of getting hit from someone coming down the hill would frighten me.

1889
03:08:09,716 --> 03:08:13,958
And for that reason, I went out two times to look at it just because I wanted to,

1890
03:08:15,070 --> 03:08:17,932
at different times of the day, because I wanted to get a good feel for it.

1891
03:08:18,692 --> 03:08:29,039
And I just don't think without the relief, the ability to park in that yard, in that driveway is non-existent.

1892
03:08:29,959 --> 03:08:33,682
Not if one wanted to remain safe and avoid the hospital.

1893
03:08:33,702 --> 03:08:38,345
Director Hunt.

1894
03:08:42,619 --> 03:08:43,659
Good evening.

1895
03:08:43,839 --> 03:08:44,260
Thank you.

1896
03:08:45,380 --> 03:08:49,362
So I wanted to just share a few things, particularly from the planning perspective.

1897
03:08:50,822 --> 03:08:52,503
And also just a logistical thing.

1898
03:08:52,903 --> 03:08:57,725
If board members are not aware, you are able to do site visits on all of these.

1899
03:08:57,785 --> 03:09:02,887
There are some municipalities that highly recommend boards do site visits to understand them.

1900
03:09:04,068 --> 03:09:08,732
But I am very familiar with this area and Fulton Street.

1901
03:09:08,772 --> 03:09:12,756
It is completely unreasonable to ask somebody to back in and out of that driveway.

1902
03:09:13,117 --> 03:09:14,978
That's a very dangerous location.

1903
03:09:15,539 --> 03:09:22,046
It is, in this case, as the applicant is describing, the hill, the curve, and everything.

1904
03:09:22,506 --> 03:09:24,168
That is a correct description of it.

1905
03:09:25,629 --> 03:09:38,477
That all said, I do wonder why this couldn't be just a driveway that one could back in and out of on the other side, because it would be reasonable to do that on St Francis Street.

1906
03:09:38,537 --> 03:09:39,918
It's a much smaller street.

1907
03:09:41,459 --> 03:09:48,982
If why a huge swath is needed and a cut through on their yard that I'm that I'm not understanding.

1908
03:09:49,883 --> 03:09:52,604
And I would want to see kind of more detailed plans.

1909
03:09:52,664 --> 03:09:55,145
I feel like it's a it's a sketch.

1910
03:09:56,365 --> 03:10:01,066
But it seems to me that one could just have the driveway be on St.

1911
03:10:01,126 --> 03:10:08,588
Francis Street and remove the driveway that's currently in the front yard on Fulton Street, since their address is in fact on Fulton Street.

1912
03:10:09,228 --> 03:10:10,168
I would ask about that.

1913
03:10:11,329 --> 03:10:15,570
Or why it couldn't be in the backyard, other than people like a backyard.

1914
03:10:16,050 --> 03:10:25,672
But I just wanted to share that it's, from a planning perspective, it's not a safe place for somebody to be driving it, backing in and out on that street as well.

1915
03:10:26,772 --> 03:10:26,992
So.

1916
03:10:30,313 --> 03:10:30,734
Commissioner.

1917
03:10:31,414 --> 03:10:32,194
Thank you, Alicia.

1918
03:10:32,234 --> 03:10:33,274
Thank you, Derek.

1919
03:10:34,095 --> 03:10:37,876
Yeah, I do want to share that yes, site visits are common in some communities.

1920
03:10:37,896 --> 03:10:43,598
The only caveat is if you all show up at once and create a forum, you cannot deliberate on the subject.

1921
03:10:43,778 --> 03:10:46,579
That has been explained to me in numerous occasions.

1922
03:10:47,619 --> 03:10:49,860
And there is some case law out there that has

1923
03:10:51,035 --> 03:10:54,998
as picked up on safety as a reasonable hardship for a variance.

1924
03:10:55,298 --> 03:11:03,324
So that is within your purview to consider that as something outside of the other components you're used to for a variance.

1925
03:11:03,344 --> 03:11:04,745
That's all I got.

1926
03:11:06,286 --> 03:11:06,967
Thank you, Commissioner.

1927
03:11:08,288 --> 03:11:08,488
Hunter?

1928
03:11:10,444 --> 03:11:10,905
Yeah.

1929
03:11:11,425 --> 03:11:29,281
What Director Hunt was saying was something that I had been thinking about as well, although looking again around the corner on the street views, there is a built-in garage on Fulton, and so that's why the current driveway is there.

1930
03:11:29,841 --> 03:11:34,605
I wanted to ask the attorney if that garage is still in use.

1931
03:11:35,046 --> 03:11:36,767
Is that a functioning garage?

1932
03:11:37,888 --> 03:11:50,815
It's a functioning garage, but it hasn't been used to put a car in recently because they're really not utilizing the driveway because of the risk that we've been talking about with getting backing into and onto an unseated vehicle.

1933
03:11:50,835 --> 03:11:56,478
So if this were approved, those variants were approved, then it would become a, they'd be able to use the garage.

1934
03:11:57,659 --> 03:11:59,680
They would, in theory, be able to use the garage, yes.

1935
03:12:05,882 --> 03:12:11,346
I mean, that's a little hard to assess from the lens though with the weird angles.

1936
03:12:11,486 --> 03:12:14,608
So I mean, maybe you could back it up.

1937
03:12:15,288 --> 03:12:16,549
Can I offer a suggestion?

1938
03:12:18,979 --> 03:12:25,023
I would suggest the applicant consider continually meet with the engineering department of the DPW.

1939
03:12:25,163 --> 03:12:30,447
They could talk about impervious air at curb cuts, and you can meet with the traffic engineer to talk about safety.

1940
03:12:31,007 --> 03:12:40,334
And they may have some recommendations on how to improve the design or alter the design so that it meets the expert's concerns.

1941
03:12:40,354 --> 03:12:43,637
And they could come back next month with something fleshed out.

1942
03:12:51,843 --> 03:12:54,284
Chris, go ahead.

1943
03:12:54,444 --> 03:12:55,865
Thank you, Mr. Chair.

1944
03:12:55,885 --> 03:13:01,227
I understand that I probably will not be voting on this proposal.

1945
03:13:01,387 --> 03:13:04,068
So my comment is just that a comment.

1946
03:13:04,995 --> 03:13:10,179
But yeah, I think this sets a bad precedent, to be blunt about it.

1947
03:13:11,420 --> 03:13:12,341
We don't set precedents.

1948
03:13:15,704 --> 03:13:16,985
Yeah.

1949
03:13:17,145 --> 03:13:28,435
Well, to the extent that everyone on Fulton Street has a hard time backing out and pulling in, there is that part of the precedent that I speak of.

1950
03:13:32,299 --> 03:13:36,161
And they're lucky in a way that they've got this side street to access.

1951
03:13:36,981 --> 03:13:44,465
But I would echo what the planning director just said about both sides.

1952
03:13:44,865 --> 03:13:54,510
And I would echo what ZVA members said about what has been done to mitigate a dangerous situation right now.

1953
03:13:55,951 --> 03:13:59,613
And if you look at the Google photos, there is a large hedge

1954
03:14:00,449 --> 03:14:03,591
that runs along the whole front of the house.

1955
03:14:03,672 --> 03:14:11,257
So I understand they're not using driveway, so maybe the hedge is there because the driveway is in disuse.

1956
03:14:11,437 --> 03:14:27,970
But why the double drive around two entry driveway is necessary, it seems to be a bad precedent.

1957
03:14:27,990 --> 03:14:28,731
Let's put it that way.

1958
03:14:29,932 --> 03:14:30,192
Thank you.

1959
03:14:32,163 --> 03:14:34,545
Thank you, Chris.

1960
03:14:34,605 --> 03:14:35,906
Mr. Attorney Rappaport?

1961
03:14:36,566 --> 03:14:37,587
Yeah, one quick thing.

1962
03:14:38,227 --> 03:14:40,529
My understanding is it's not going to be pavement.

1963
03:14:40,569 --> 03:14:41,709
It's going to be P stone.

1964
03:14:42,030 --> 03:14:46,773
So it's not going to be asphalt on the driveway.

1965
03:14:47,333 --> 03:14:49,555
That's one of the things I just wanted to clarify.

1966
03:14:51,036 --> 03:14:57,280
And I think timing it from my client is relatively important because he's going to be a father tomorrow night.

1967
03:14:59,564 --> 03:15:02,746
They need to make arrangements to have something move forward on this.

1968
03:15:03,967 --> 03:15:04,888
I did see the hedge.

1969
03:15:05,929 --> 03:15:11,313
What I did notice when I was there is backing out on the street, as Ms.

1970
03:15:11,353 --> 03:15:17,297
Hunt was saying, hedge, no hedge, it's so dangerous to come out of that driveway.

1971
03:15:17,317 --> 03:15:25,784
I know we just heard about, while Fulton Street's busy in general, they're on a downhill section.

1972
03:15:26,791 --> 03:15:28,652
where a curve bends downhill.

1973
03:15:29,453 --> 03:15:31,914
You're looking, you're having to look a little bit uphill.

1974
03:15:32,255 --> 03:15:35,577
One of the pictures I submitted from the driveway shows a car.

1975
03:15:36,417 --> 03:15:38,159
It came on so fast, it was stunning.

1976
03:15:38,199 --> 03:15:40,500
I was taking my picture, there was nothing in the frame.

1977
03:15:41,341 --> 03:15:55,370
So I think, well, while I hear the board's concerns that it's not a perfect use, it's one that achieves the goals of promoting their safety, that of the people in the neighborhood, and as a minimum impact, it's creating one

1978
03:15:56,417 --> 03:15:59,058
curb cut over on St.

1979
03:15:59,098 --> 03:16:03,801
Francis Street, and it doesn't foreclose them from using that garage in the future.

1980
03:16:04,862 --> 03:16:14,687
I would hate to see them close off the curb cut on Fulton, take away that portion of the driveway.

1981
03:16:14,707 --> 03:16:16,468
Then they could never use that garage again.

1982
03:16:16,868 --> 03:16:18,609
They may need to use that garage again.

1983
03:16:18,929 --> 03:16:19,990
They may sell the home.

1984
03:16:20,610 --> 03:16:24,012
Maybe someone would want to use the garage

1985
03:16:25,609 --> 03:16:29,470
They may decide to use the garage when they have a newborn and don't want to be traipsing through the rain.

1986
03:16:29,951 --> 03:16:35,833
So I think the plan was designed in this manner to try to meet all of the needs.

1987
03:16:36,513 --> 03:16:49,277
And I guess as you would know more than anyone, there's a lot of solutions are imperfect, but I would submit to the board, this is at least a good solution to deal with a fairly serious problem.

1988
03:16:52,305 --> 03:17:07,053
I know as we talked about the landscaping and the DPW involvement, I think there's going to be less concerned about stormwater and it's stone because the water is still going to be going down.

1989
03:17:07,113 --> 03:17:13,396
It's not like he's bringing in asphalt paving that's going to fill up this and create stormwater elsewhere.

1990
03:17:16,417 --> 03:17:19,459
I certainly hear the board's concerns and I'm amenable to

1991
03:17:20,640 --> 03:17:31,602
hearing your concerns and doing what we can, but I'm deeply concerned about getting a solution for them to this time-sensitive problem for them.

1992
03:17:31,862 --> 03:17:38,163
And I would say they're in a position different than many people on Fulton Street because of the location of where their lot is.

1993
03:17:40,963 --> 03:17:41,664
Thank you, Attorney General.

1994
03:17:42,184 --> 03:17:42,444
Hunter?

1995
03:17:46,424 --> 03:17:48,125
Sorry, does Chris have his hand up?

1996
03:17:50,897 --> 03:17:52,559
Or do you mean to lower it?

1997
03:17:53,159 --> 03:17:53,399
Okay.

1998
03:17:54,520 --> 03:17:56,082
I guess I had a point of information.

1999
03:17:56,142 --> 03:17:57,763
Did we open public hearing on this?

2000
03:18:01,667 --> 03:18:03,068
Because they feel like we're deliberating.

2001
03:18:03,108 --> 03:18:07,752
So if we haven't, I'd like to motion that we open public.

2002
03:18:07,772 --> 03:18:08,033
We did.

2003
03:18:08,993 --> 03:18:09,294
We did.

2004
03:18:09,414 --> 03:18:09,654
Okay.

2005
03:18:09,694 --> 03:18:10,255
Yeah, we did.

2006
03:18:10,695 --> 03:18:10,975
Okay.

2007
03:18:11,095 --> 03:18:11,416
Thank you.

2008
03:18:11,456 --> 03:18:13,438
Getting confused with all of the different ones.

2009
03:18:13,958 --> 03:18:15,099
It's getting late too.

2010
03:18:15,499 --> 03:18:15,720
Yeah.

2011
03:18:16,770 --> 03:18:33,171
So just to comment, I guess, about what the attorney said in terms of timing, I would just say, you know, I'm inclined to support this, but I also want to make sure it's done in a way that is well designed for the public and

2012
03:18:35,752 --> 03:18:38,233
Nobody's fault here that they're having a baby tomorrow.

2013
03:18:38,253 --> 03:18:42,454
I assume they had prior notice of that.

2014
03:18:44,114 --> 03:18:54,456
We should not be rushed if we think that we have to wait one month to get good design.

2015
03:18:54,616 --> 03:18:59,737
I'm amenable to taking the building commissioner's suggestion of

2016
03:19:02,998 --> 03:19:12,660
continuing it so that until the traffic engineer can review it, I'd like to see that it's a little bit more than a sketch.

2017
03:19:14,221 --> 03:19:18,822
Then I think it would not be a problem.

2018
03:19:18,842 --> 03:19:24,283
I agree that we don't want to close off the Fulton Street access because that's where the garage is.

2019
03:19:24,483 --> 03:19:32,105
I think that would be mandating a hardship on them because that's the way the property was built.

2020
03:19:33,265 --> 03:19:35,265
Anyway, those are my two cents.

2021
03:19:37,306 --> 03:19:37,866
Thank you, Andrew.

2022
03:19:38,226 --> 03:19:38,966
Point of order.

2023
03:19:39,286 --> 03:19:52,089
If we go the continuation route, we likely do have to do that with the applicant's consent to at least waive the statutory timelines.

2024
03:19:52,149 --> 03:19:56,150
Otherwise, the board would just have to make a call one way or the other.

2025
03:19:57,510 --> 03:20:03,515
whether our next regular meeting will be within the statutory timeline for a decision.

2026
03:20:03,595 --> 03:20:09,039
So it would really at least be in part up to the applicant in this case.

2027
03:20:11,981 --> 03:20:12,381
Thank you, Mike.

2028
03:20:12,581 --> 03:20:13,442
Yep, understood.

2029
03:20:14,243 --> 03:20:18,766
I guess, so Attorney Rapp, you made your statement earlier.

2030
03:20:20,287 --> 03:20:26,432
Are you opposed to a continuance, or are you not going to request one, I guess?

2031
03:20:27,373 --> 03:20:32,475
Well, I'm waiting to get an answer back from Mr. Reid, who's on the call.

2032
03:20:33,135 --> 03:20:36,637
I don't have a problem with a continuance.

2033
03:20:37,497 --> 03:20:38,598
I want to get his assent.

2034
03:20:38,758 --> 03:20:43,980
I know they're extremely concerned about the safety.

2035
03:20:44,000 --> 03:20:49,122
I am just hearing back from him that he'll agree to a continuance.

2036
03:20:55,123 --> 03:21:07,870
I suppose I don't mean we'll get, we'll see if we can get the traffic engineer to give what exactly is it the low from what it sounds to me is like the board isn't adverse to the requested relief.

2037
03:21:08,591 --> 03:21:12,693
They're just looking for a different way.

2038
03:21:12,913 --> 03:21:14,114
Am I correct in hearing that?

2039
03:21:18,016 --> 03:21:20,958
What I'm hearing and any board member can correct me.

2040
03:21:22,660 --> 03:21:36,305
is that we would like to see a more complete design after review and have you engage with the DPW to make sure that all of their concerns with the design are covered.

2041
03:21:36,325 --> 03:21:38,486
OK.

2042
03:21:40,627 --> 03:21:42,827
Yeah, just to add to that.

2043
03:21:42,847 --> 03:21:46,449
So really, it's not a specific

2044
03:21:47,569 --> 03:22:05,257
change that I'm looking for to the design, it's additional information on that this design has been reviewed and if needed, iterated upon with those city departments.

2045
03:22:08,338 --> 03:22:13,721
Curb cuts require approval from a couple of city officials as well.

2046
03:22:15,292 --> 03:22:18,114
I feel like they're going to have to be reviewing this one way or the other.

2047
03:22:18,454 --> 03:22:21,897
It might as well, let's do it up front so we see what it is that they want.

2048
03:22:22,237 --> 03:22:26,480
I'd like to know whether they have any recommendations about the landscaping just for sight lines.

2049
03:22:27,460 --> 03:22:39,708
I'm glad, Attorney Rapa, you mentioned that it's going to be P-stone, but I'd like to just understand the materials, make sure that the P-stone is not going to get washed down the hill.

2050
03:22:43,372 --> 03:22:44,913
Yeah, things like that.

2051
03:22:44,953 --> 03:22:51,035
I mean, I see that, you know, the walkway to the front steps, you're gonna, I think this driveway is going to go over that walkway.

2052
03:22:51,075 --> 03:22:52,896
But so I just want to know how it all works.

2053
03:22:53,056 --> 03:22:53,656
I want to see it.

2054
03:22:55,497 --> 03:23:04,580
I just want to add that, you know, how to utilize the garage in a more succinct way.

2055
03:23:04,620 --> 03:23:06,881
If you're not using it now, how will it be able

2056
03:23:08,738 --> 03:23:12,499
to use the garage and in different formats, right?

2057
03:23:12,519 --> 03:23:31,944
So if you had kept it in the way that it currently exists and it needs to be expanded in a certain way to make it safer, you know, what does that look like versus like extending it all the way out to the other side of the street so that you could have two parking spots utilizing your garage versus taking one away from public use.

2058
03:23:32,909 --> 03:23:34,010
on the other side of the street.

2059
03:23:34,050 --> 03:23:34,751
Right.

2060
03:23:34,771 --> 03:23:45,399
I think the essential thing is they're going if the board granted the relief, there would be two parking spaces on the property and they would be they would not be using public parking.

2061
03:23:45,459 --> 03:23:53,785
So it would be it would be no negative reduction of spaces in that sense from the public.

2062
03:23:54,466 --> 03:23:55,407
The garage itself.

2063
03:23:57,699 --> 03:24:06,371
It seems to me that they would be able to get down through this proposed driveway and get into that garage area the way this is put together.

2064
03:24:07,573 --> 03:24:13,901
I am happy to have Mr. Reid and I will work with him on getting DPW to review the design.

2065
03:24:16,944 --> 03:24:21,706
I suppose DPW will opine on what type of stone they want.

2066
03:24:22,627 --> 03:24:25,768
Certainly Mr. Reed's going to use stone.

2067
03:24:25,808 --> 03:24:34,653
They may have different variations of how they want it to be so that it doesn't wash down or stays in place.

2068
03:24:36,313 --> 03:24:43,237
Is there anything other than just a DPW that you'd want on when we reach out to get this plan amended?

2069
03:24:46,058 --> 03:24:47,319
I think the traffic engineer.

2070
03:24:47,339 --> 03:24:50,399
Thank you, Andrew.

2071
03:24:50,419 --> 03:24:53,120
Mike, did you have another question?

2072
03:24:55,080 --> 03:25:05,843
In the Medford structure, the city engineer sits under the DPW, so I believe it's the city engineer and the director of traffic are the

2073
03:25:06,657 --> 03:25:08,198
the two key individuals here.

2074
03:25:08,418 --> 03:25:30,745
And in my prior role as chair of this body, the city engineer has told me on at least two different occasions that, in general, when these curb cuts come before us, that it's advisable to direct the applicant to talk with the engineering department before taking action on the request.

2075
03:25:30,865 --> 03:25:35,947
So yeah, I think city engineer Owen Wartella and

2076
03:25:36,573 --> 03:25:40,956
Director of Transportation, Todd Blake, would be the two folks to talk to.

2077
03:25:40,976 --> 03:25:42,157
Okay.

2078
03:25:43,238 --> 03:25:44,399
In addition to DPW?

2079
03:25:46,060 --> 03:25:56,147
Well, engineering sits within DPW, so I'm not aware of any one within DPW other than the city engineer that would need to weigh in, but I could be wrong.

2080
03:25:57,068 --> 03:25:57,928
Okay, certainly.

2081
03:25:59,409 --> 03:26:00,310
We'll make that happen.

2082
03:26:01,697 --> 03:26:14,344
You know, the other just the other thing to consider here is that I, you know, if we were to approve this, you know, I would hope that it that the additional.

2083
03:26:15,687 --> 03:26:22,650
you know, exit the driveway in the front yard wouldn't be used for like permanent parking, right?

2084
03:26:22,730 --> 03:26:35,137
Because we generally don't want cars to be in the front yards and that this addition of a pathway of an exit would enable the garage to be used.

2085
03:26:35,157 --> 03:26:37,538
So you could have someone in the garage

2086
03:26:38,058 --> 03:26:44,981
and someone in the driveway behind it on Fulton Street, but then to pull out, you're pulling out towards the side street, St.

2087
03:26:45,021 --> 03:26:45,741
Francis.

2088
03:26:48,163 --> 03:26:53,105
Just be in mind that that could be a potential condition for us to consider.

2089
03:27:00,068 --> 03:27:03,429
I'll make a motion to continue this matter to our next regular meeting.

2090
03:27:06,551 --> 03:27:06,891
Seconded.

2091
03:27:08,873 --> 03:27:10,573
Thank you.

2092
03:27:10,593 --> 03:27:11,013
Mary Lee?

2093
03:27:12,494 --> 03:27:12,594
Aye.

2094
03:27:12,614 --> 03:27:14,494
Rebecca Les?

2095
03:27:15,514 --> 03:27:15,634
Aye.

2096
03:27:17,615 --> 03:27:18,235
Mike Calderon?

2097
03:27:19,015 --> 03:27:19,135
Aye.

2098
03:27:20,235 --> 03:27:20,715
Andrew Liver?

2099
03:27:21,396 --> 03:27:21,516
Aye.

2100
03:27:22,556 --> 03:27:23,256
Jamie Thompson?

2101
03:27:23,556 --> 03:27:23,656
Aye.

2102
03:27:27,917 --> 03:27:30,338
We have continuance and we will see you again.

2103
03:27:31,658 --> 03:27:32,598
Thank you members of the board.

2104
03:27:37,077 --> 03:27:42,338
And Dennis, can you take us to our MySpace?

2105
03:27:42,538 --> 03:27:45,339
52 Garfield Avenue, case number A-2024-10.

2106
03:27:46,059 --> 03:28:00,862
Applicant and owner of 52 Garfield Realty LLC is petitioning for a variant special permit in Chapter 94 City Method Zoning to add a fourth-towing unit in the pre-existing nonconforming furnished garage at 52 Garfield Avenue, requiring a special permit for the City Method Zoning against Chapter 94 Sections 5.2.1.1.

2107
03:28:03,848 --> 03:28:17,809
Additionally, variances will be required for side and rear yard setbacks to the garage as well as the minimum distance between structures for the city methods on the orients chapter 94 table be dimension table dimensional requirements as well as the parking variance for the city methods on the ordinance chapter 94 section 6.1 point 3.

2108
03:28:20,983 --> 03:28:22,724
Good evening, Mr. Chair.

2109
03:28:22,744 --> 03:28:24,144
Congratulations on the new office.

2110
03:28:25,005 --> 03:28:30,107
Attorney Adam Dash representing 52 Garfield Realty LLC, who's the applicant and owner.

2111
03:28:30,888 --> 03:28:33,689
Monish Lalani is here, who's the manager of the LLC.

2112
03:28:34,429 --> 03:28:36,190
Jose Guzman, the project architect.

2113
03:28:36,230 --> 03:28:40,152
And you can see Ian McKinnon here is the project traffic engineer from Howard Stein Hudson.

2114
03:28:41,472 --> 03:28:43,253
So let me share my screen.

2115
03:28:43,273 --> 03:28:44,634
Do I have the ability to do that?

2116
03:28:44,734 --> 03:28:45,334
I do not.

2117
03:28:45,554 --> 03:28:47,175
If Mr. McDougall could grant that.

2118
03:28:48,876 --> 03:28:49,476
Fantastic.

2119
03:28:51,184 --> 03:28:51,545
All right.

2120
03:29:00,241 --> 03:29:00,622
There we go.

2121
03:29:01,503 --> 03:29:01,624
So.

2122
03:29:06,160 --> 03:29:08,222
You are blocking my ability to scroll down.

2123
03:29:08,482 --> 03:29:08,903
There we go.

2124
03:29:09,704 --> 03:29:24,136
So this is a regarding 52 Garfield Avenue, which, as you can see on the left here, is an existing nonconforming three family, basically triple-decker building type with a detached garage, which has finished with a bathroom in it.

2125
03:29:25,097 --> 03:29:29,240
and it's got an existing driveway in the single family two zoning district.

2126
03:29:29,740 --> 03:29:32,162
You'll note here on the right is a gas station.

2127
03:29:33,283 --> 03:29:40,007
This is a very different house in the SF2 zone and is a very different house and unique on this street.

2128
03:29:40,848 --> 03:29:46,351
The proposal is to create a fourth dwelling unit in that existing detached garage here to the right and the rear.

2129
03:29:47,312 --> 03:29:49,393
No other changes are happening to this property.

2130
03:29:49,493 --> 03:29:53,055
And in this way, a dwelling unit can be added without changing the built environment.

2131
03:29:53,816 --> 03:30:04,822
And the reason why we're here tonight is that creating the dwelling unit in the garage requires zoning relief because the current zoning ordinance does not have the flexibility to address the city's housing shortage in creative ways such as this.

2132
03:30:08,520 --> 03:30:29,948
So, creating the fourth dwelling unit in the existing garage requires the Zoning Board of Appeals to grant, one, a special permit to alter and extend the preexisting nonconforming three-unit use to four units, two, variances for the right side and the rear setback for the existing garage, because it will now become a principal structure by having a dwelling unit in it.

2133
03:30:30,508 --> 03:30:35,210
And that's because the garage is close to the rear and right side property lines, as garages often are.

2134
03:30:36,487 --> 03:30:50,626
Third would be a variance for the separation between the two existing structures, also due to having a dwelling unit in the garage making the garage a principal structure and that the garage is close to the main three-family, which again garages often are.

2135
03:30:52,216 --> 03:30:59,999
And the variances for fourth, the variances for the number of parking spaces and for the parking layout due to adding a fourth unit in the garage.

2136
03:31:00,799 --> 03:31:05,561
Six are being provided, eight are required, and the spaces just jut out into the front of the house.

2137
03:31:05,721 --> 03:31:07,762
Again, this is all in the existing driveway.

2138
03:31:08,482 --> 03:31:10,063
Mr. McKinnon will address this later.

2139
03:31:11,023 --> 03:31:25,915
Just as a footnote, we also would have to go after this to the Community Development Board for a special permit for having two principal structures in the lot because, again, putting a dwelling unit in the garage makes that a second principal structure.

2140
03:31:26,775 --> 03:31:32,840
So despite the relief that's sought here that I just stated, the existing buildings on the lot are not physically changing.

2141
03:31:33,320 --> 03:31:38,725
The relief is more in the technical nature due to the status of the garage changing and the existing structures on the lot.

2142
03:31:39,842 --> 03:31:47,224
So again, this is what you've got now is this fully sprinklered three-family house with the garage to the right.

2143
03:31:47,504 --> 03:31:51,785
And you can see the way the garage is currently, there's no garage door to pull into it.

2144
03:31:53,125 --> 03:31:59,747
This is the, both the garage here, this is from the rear, both the three-family house and the garage both have two egresses.

2145
03:32:01,408 --> 03:32:06,569
On the left side of the three-family house, you can see the electricity exists to power the garage unit.

2146
03:32:07,925 --> 03:32:10,528
On the right side, this is on the driveway three family house.

2147
03:32:10,548 --> 03:32:14,833
This is a camera that would be installed to that will police the parking situation.

2148
03:32:16,055 --> 03:32:22,002
And this is actually a close up of the garage in the back right corner of the property in the primary egress as it appears today.

2149
03:32:23,724 --> 03:32:25,947
This is the left side of the garage.

2150
03:32:25,987 --> 03:32:27,749
You can see a concrete block construction.

2151
03:32:30,253 --> 03:32:33,775
and that is the secondary egress on the other side of the garage.

2152
03:32:34,555 --> 03:32:38,517
So these photos illustrate the existing conditions, but they're also the proposed conditions.

2153
03:32:39,558 --> 03:32:42,439
The existing three-family structure, as I said, fully sprinklered.

2154
03:32:42,840 --> 03:32:44,640
The garage would also be fully sprinklered.

2155
03:32:44,681 --> 03:32:48,362
Therefore, the separation between the structures is not a safety issue.

2156
03:32:48,402 --> 03:32:52,484
In fact, the garage at one time would have had cars in it that would have had flammable materials in them.

2157
03:32:53,405 --> 03:32:54,185
Both structures...

2158
03:32:55,606 --> 03:33:00,831
have the appropriate utilities to do what they need to do for this project.

2159
03:33:01,071 --> 03:33:10,821
And the right side of Butter is a gas station, and the rear of Butter is a structure that is some distance from the rear lot and is fenced, as you can see here with the fences.

2160
03:33:14,900 --> 03:33:21,269
As the garage is not changing in dimensions, the side and the rear setback variances would not impact the neighbors at all.

2161
03:33:21,950 --> 03:33:28,158
Again, this is the garage has no impact on the commercial butter, which is the gas station on this side.

2162
03:33:29,440 --> 03:33:30,842
This is a look at the lot.

2163
03:33:31,760 --> 03:33:34,661
Again, Garfield Street in the bottom, the gas stations on the right.

2164
03:33:35,162 --> 03:33:37,283
You can see the three-family house in the middle.

2165
03:33:37,843 --> 03:33:45,547
Back here in the right back corner is the garage where we'd be putting the fourth unit, and you can see the six-car layout in the existing driveway.

2166
03:33:46,788 --> 03:33:55,052
As you can see in the site plan, the shape of the combined structures and the layout on the lot, which will not change, sort of in this little L shape.

2167
03:33:56,063 --> 03:34:02,416
Is such that the built environment precludes complying with the cell side and the rear setbacks building separation or parking requirements.

2168
03:34:03,498 --> 03:34:07,666
1 would need to demolish the existing structures to comply, which would greatly alter the neighborhood.

2169
03:34:08,564 --> 03:34:27,279
Adding a fourth unit in a manner which does not alter the neighborhood construct at all, much less detrimentally impacts it, and which addresses Medford's need for more housing, is a way which meets the requirements of the special permit being sought tonight for the fourth unit, but the variances would be needed to make that happen.

2170
03:34:27,939 --> 03:34:32,603
I'll turn this over now to Jose Guzman if you want to explain the site plan and the floor plan.

2171
03:34:40,407 --> 03:34:40,888
Good evening.

2172
03:34:41,328 --> 03:34:42,409
My name is Jose Guzman.

2173
03:34:42,429 --> 03:34:44,670
I'm the architect of record on this project.

2174
03:34:46,071 --> 03:34:50,154
I originally worked on the 3 family home.

2175
03:34:50,274 --> 03:34:51,455
We did the renovations.

2176
03:34:52,396 --> 03:34:57,079
And then subsequent to that, we were asked to help in assisting with the.

2177
03:34:57,819 --> 03:35:00,441
4th unit, the structure.

2178
03:35:01,902 --> 03:35:02,723
is sound.

2179
03:35:03,744 --> 03:35:11,369
It's a baring masonry walls, slap on grade with wood joists, rafters rather.

2180
03:35:12,350 --> 03:35:21,356
And it has a rear yard, front yard, obviously with the driveway will be used for parking.

2181
03:35:25,031 --> 03:35:33,923
I think that there is a rear, on the rear, we have a fence that abuts the rear yard of the neighbor to the back.

2182
03:35:33,983 --> 03:35:37,187
There's plenty of distance between the two structures.

2183
03:35:40,310 --> 03:35:53,135
There is no really risk of any fire between the two structures because one is masonry and the other one is wood, so there's no risk of fire from one to the other.

2184
03:35:53,155 --> 03:35:56,557
And I'm open for any questions you may have.

2185
03:35:57,431 --> 03:35:57,791
Uh, thank you.

2186
03:35:57,811 --> 03:36:03,532
If you want to talk, um, Jose about, there's the, just as the existing and proposed floor plan, it's fairly straightforward, but okay.

2187
03:36:03,953 --> 03:36:10,234
So right now, if you look on the left, there's an existing bathroom, uh, there's a toilet and sink.

2188
03:36:10,934 --> 03:36:17,376
Uh, there's a, at the beam, you'll see a beam where it says beam above as a steel beam that supports the rafters.

2189
03:36:18,256 --> 03:36:26,938
And, uh, on the right, you'll see the proposed layout, a small kitchen with an Island and a standup shower.

2190
03:36:27,958 --> 03:36:30,820
sink and toilet and a small bed on the right side.

2191
03:36:34,063 --> 03:36:34,783
Thank you, Jose.

2192
03:36:35,163 --> 03:36:39,246
Yes, there's a hand up or do you want us to continue?

2193
03:36:39,627 --> 03:36:40,347
Yeah.

2194
03:36:41,868 --> 03:36:42,569
Jamie, if I may.

2195
03:36:42,589 --> 03:36:44,030
Go ahead.

2196
03:36:44,750 --> 03:36:44,950
Yeah.

2197
03:36:44,970 --> 03:36:47,252
So this is for Attorney Dash.

2198
03:36:47,332 --> 03:36:54,577
I just want to ask it early enough in the process so that I'm understanding

2199
03:36:54,993 --> 03:36:58,375
and I'm understanding the analysis we're supposed to be applying here.

2200
03:37:02,838 --> 03:37:23,350
So in the zoning ordinance, the section 5 for nonconforming uses and structures, 5.4 in particular, it states that a variance is required if a change is made in such a manner to create a new nonconformity.

2201
03:37:24,300 --> 03:37:47,572
And so what I'm trying to understand is why there isn't a use variance required in this case to convert the garage when prior to the conversion, the rear yard is conforming and then post conversion, we now have a principal structure in the rear yard.

2202
03:37:49,087 --> 03:37:49,327
Right.

2203
03:37:50,228 --> 03:37:59,292
Under the current zoning, to alter and extend the preexisting nonconforming use from three to four units is a special permit from the Zoning Board of Appeals, not a variance.

2204
03:38:01,053 --> 03:38:01,693
That is- Correct.

2205
03:38:01,993 --> 03:38:11,818
But it also says in section 5.4 that if doing so creates a new nonconformity,

2206
03:38:12,927 --> 03:38:14,428
then a variance is required.

2207
03:38:15,068 --> 03:38:15,328
Right.

2208
03:38:15,368 --> 03:38:17,209
And these are the variances that we are seeking.

2209
03:38:17,269 --> 03:38:19,510
Again, they're all existing conditions.

2210
03:38:20,770 --> 03:38:27,133
Well, the derriere isn't because you're taking an accessory structure and you're making it a second principle structure.

2211
03:38:27,193 --> 03:38:27,493
Correct.

2212
03:38:27,573 --> 03:38:27,853
Correct.

2213
03:38:28,673 --> 03:38:30,254
At a legal basis, that is correct.

2214
03:38:30,314 --> 03:38:32,275
And so that is one of the variances we are seeking.

2215
03:38:32,335 --> 03:38:36,677
However, it is not a physical change to the existing layers of law.

2216
03:38:37,057 --> 03:38:37,217
Yeah.

2217
03:38:37,757 --> 03:38:37,877
Right.

2218
03:38:39,965 --> 03:38:40,567
OK, thank you.

2219
03:38:41,249 --> 03:38:42,252
No, not a problem.

2220
03:38:42,834 --> 03:38:46,223
It is a little bit of a tricky one, so I welcome the questions.

2221
03:38:46,264 --> 03:38:46,725
Not a problem.

2222
03:38:48,540 --> 03:38:53,763
So moving on here, I would note that the garage, as you saw, the garage has been altered.

2223
03:38:53,823 --> 03:38:55,645
It's not really usable as a garage.

2224
03:38:55,665 --> 03:38:58,326
It would be a hardship to make it usable as a garage.

2225
03:38:59,127 --> 03:39:11,995
The city's housing production plan noted a need for studio and one-bedroom units like this, and the city amended the zoning ordinance to allow for ADUs by a special permit in an existing detached structure on the same lot, such as the garage in this case.

2226
03:39:13,126 --> 03:39:25,961
The variances for dimensional relief are not, if they're not granted for such units, then Medford will be hard-pressed to meet its housing goals and will force property owners to demolish existing structures in order to comply.

2227
03:39:25,981 --> 03:39:33,489
And this runs against the purpose of the zoning ordinance in allowing detached structures to become dwelling units by special permit while preserving neighborhoods.

2228
03:39:34,410 --> 03:39:42,436
Preserving the existing structures and their embedded energy and reusing the materials is the sustainable way to create these dwelling units.

2229
03:39:43,777 --> 03:39:50,782
Mr. McKinnon will address, now from Howard Stein Hudson, if you could come on and address the parking variances that we're seeking.

2230
03:39:51,863 --> 03:39:52,183
Sure.

2231
03:39:52,944 --> 03:39:55,406
Thank you, Adam, and good evening, Chair and board members.

2232
03:39:55,586 --> 03:39:59,549
Ian McKinnon, the project's traffic engineer from Howard Stein Hudson in Boston.

2233
03:40:00,564 --> 03:40:02,625
I know it's getting late, so I'll be very brief here.

2234
03:40:03,785 --> 03:40:15,047
So the project submitted a traffic assessment and the reason for that, which I'll quickly highlight some of those aspects, is given the request for the parking variance in relation to travel.

2235
03:40:16,267 --> 03:40:25,349
So in front of you is a locus map that's centered on Garfield Avenue with the various alternative means of travel for a site on Garfield Avenue.

2236
03:40:26,430 --> 03:40:26,990
In particular,

2237
03:40:28,809 --> 03:40:34,713
There's a variety of public transportation and alternative means that I'll get to in a minute here.

2238
03:40:35,473 --> 03:40:51,363
But specifically, the data shows that almost 80% in this census tract from the last census use automobiles to travel, 15% commute via transit, and another 5% either walk or bike.

2239
03:40:53,647 --> 03:41:07,014
The data also suggests that as of recently as 2022, Medford car ownership rates are just under one and a half vehicles per household, which suggests that many families and households choose to only own a single car.

2240
03:41:08,415 --> 03:41:14,858
And as a standard for traffic impacts, typically trips per day or peak hour are evaluated to

2241
03:41:15,710 --> 03:41:18,851
to evaluate whether or not the impact is significant or not.

2242
03:41:18,951 --> 03:41:25,374
And this project, with its extra dwelling unit, is only proposed to add two extra trips a day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.

2243
03:41:25,394 --> 03:41:27,995
And this is a very unnoticeable amount of traffic.

2244
03:41:28,975 --> 03:41:35,658
It's just as likely that if a neighbor were to take an extra trip to the grocery store because they forgot something, that it would be the same impact.

2245
03:41:35,678 --> 03:41:40,039
So all told, there's not supposed to be any perceivable impact.

2246
03:41:40,660 --> 03:41:41,300
Next slide, Adam.

2247
03:41:44,283 --> 03:41:49,066
So before you is a little bit of a rotated site plan.

2248
03:41:49,146 --> 03:41:52,868
So north is face up and Garfield's on the right.

2249
03:41:52,948 --> 03:41:54,849
So I apologize, we've turned this a little bit on you.

2250
03:41:56,310 --> 03:41:59,931
So a couple of things to point out here as they relate to the variance request on parking.

2251
03:42:00,792 --> 03:42:04,714
The total number of spaces is proposed at six, which is currently what exists today.

2252
03:42:06,555 --> 03:42:12,718
There is an existing garage, but it's not been used for storage of parking by this owner.

2253
03:42:14,191 --> 03:42:19,673
We'll also note that there's a path of travel of egress behind each vehicle, which connects to the front door.

2254
03:42:20,274 --> 03:42:22,294
That's labeled here at nine feet.

2255
03:42:22,334 --> 03:42:25,556
It might be nine and a half, given the scale of this drawing.

2256
03:42:26,556 --> 03:42:30,198
There's also a six foot six clear path of travel.

2257
03:42:30,678 --> 03:42:35,940
And these are all, as I mentioned, clear of the driveway.

2258
03:42:36,080 --> 03:42:40,942
There is still a fully compliant pedestrian path of travel up and down the sidewalk.

2259
03:42:41,688 --> 03:42:50,011
And this setback that nine feet from the back of sidewalk allows for adequate sight lines and maneuverability to the public way.

2260
03:42:51,911 --> 03:43:09,657
The building itself falls two spaces short of the two spaces per unit zoning requirement, but we contend that the variance here is warranted given the project's location to the various alternative transportation modes that I'll talk about in a moment, the lower actual car ownership that's seen across Medford,

2261
03:43:10,542 --> 03:43:14,244
which suggests many families and households choose to only own one car.

2262
03:43:14,705 --> 03:43:26,852
And then the site parameters, this parking facility, given that they are existing, are compliant or adequate for public safety exiting and entering the site.

2263
03:43:28,232 --> 03:43:28,873
Next slide, please.

2264
03:43:29,328 --> 03:43:31,169
If I could just stay on this one real quick.

2265
03:43:31,249 --> 03:43:33,791
This actually shows the abutting house on the rear.

2266
03:43:34,492 --> 03:43:36,653
And so you can see here's the garage we're talking about.

2267
03:43:36,673 --> 03:43:43,418
And you can see how close the setbacks that we have seeking variances for on the right side up against this gas station and the rear.

2268
03:43:43,798 --> 03:43:48,161
But you can see that the garage is nowhere near the house on the property to the rear.

2269
03:43:48,781 --> 03:43:50,522
And it's an existing condition anyway.

2270
03:43:50,683 --> 03:43:51,123
Sorry, Ian.

2271
03:43:51,783 --> 03:43:52,484
No, no, no worries.

2272
03:43:55,585 --> 03:44:00,209
So as part of the special permit application, we submitted a transportation assessment.

2273
03:44:00,549 --> 03:44:05,353
I'm not sure if you all had a chance to review it, but I just gave a pretty quick summary here.

2274
03:44:05,933 --> 03:44:09,256
I'm just going to breeze through the next couple of slides here.

2275
03:44:12,278 --> 03:44:16,201
So the site access, as we discussed, will also continue to be served by the existing driveway.

2276
03:44:16,241 --> 03:44:18,123
There are no changes proposed to the curb cut.

2277
03:44:18,143 --> 03:44:19,424
It will stay as is.

2278
03:44:21,285 --> 03:44:23,227
And the existing paved driveway will stay as is.

2279
03:44:24,351 --> 03:44:28,073
This is also similar to the graphic you saw on the first slide.

2280
03:44:28,473 --> 03:44:35,995
I will note that there is an existing blue bike station and a zip car rental, which are other alternatives, all within a 10-minute walk.

2281
03:44:36,916 --> 03:44:44,238
So allows for those who want to choose to commute by that method or they need a car for an errand, for example.

2282
03:44:45,819 --> 03:44:46,319
Next slide.

2283
03:44:49,320 --> 03:44:50,921
And this will be my last slide, too.

2284
03:44:52,408 --> 03:45:08,457
I wanted to note that there's two bus routes here, both within a half-mile walk and one particularly directly adjacent on the site on Salem Street, with connections to Malden Center and also Sullivan Square, which provide access to downtown Boston for those that work there or others.

2285
03:45:09,217 --> 03:45:18,963
These bus routes are very frequent, 20-minute service, which is pretty good, which allows people the reliability to trust and use public transportation to commute.

2286
03:45:20,034 --> 03:45:22,044
So with that, I'll pass it back to Adam.

2287
03:45:22,648 --> 03:45:23,070
Thanks, Ian.

2288
03:45:24,304 --> 03:45:35,788
You've just seen there's six letters of support from the neighborhood, including from the two direct debaters on both the left and the right side, the right side being the gas station ownership, and those have been provided to you.

2289
03:45:36,348 --> 03:45:44,070
People recognize that this proposal does not detrimentally impact the neighborhood, and they like to see that the built environment remains unchanged.

2290
03:45:44,710 --> 03:45:52,473
The garage is tucked into the back right corner of the lot, which makes it hard to see from the street, and the parking relief is small and will have no neighborhood impact.

2291
03:45:52,973 --> 03:45:54,173
as Mr. McKinnon stated.

2292
03:45:54,993 --> 03:45:59,434
The relief sought does not derogate from the intent and purpose of the zoning ordinance, as I've said.

2293
03:45:59,454 --> 03:46:02,335
In fact, the relief promotes that intent and purpose.

2294
03:46:03,015 --> 03:46:13,537
I would note Mass General Laws, Chapter 40A, Section 10 states that variances can be owing to structures and circumstances relating to structures on the lot.

2295
03:46:17,491 --> 03:46:31,447
and so it says Bobrowski has stated in his book on handbook on Massachusetts evidence that the courts have in some cases found that the lot and the structures in the lot can be the basis for variance.

2296
03:46:31,487 --> 03:46:33,769
I would note that the properties and the structures are unique.

2297
03:46:33,809 --> 03:46:37,173
I want to show you if you can see this is the

2298
03:46:38,374 --> 03:46:39,155
Google Street View.

2299
03:46:39,895 --> 03:46:41,196
So you can see the triple decker.

2300
03:46:41,216 --> 03:46:42,617
You can see to the right the garage.

2301
03:46:42,637 --> 03:46:43,998
You can see the existing driveway.

2302
03:46:44,058 --> 03:46:44,859
I can't see what you're showing.

2303
03:46:45,459 --> 03:46:46,480
You can't see what I'm showing.

2304
03:46:46,540 --> 03:46:46,800
Hold on.

2305
03:46:46,820 --> 03:46:48,041
Let me stop and start again.

2306
03:46:48,141 --> 03:46:51,204
Sometimes when I switch, that happens.

2307
03:46:53,465 --> 03:46:55,787
I think you need to see the neighborhood context.

2308
03:47:02,852 --> 03:47:03,232
How's that?

2309
03:47:05,942 --> 03:47:06,383
Fantastic.

2310
03:47:06,943 --> 03:47:10,589
So this is the triple-decker that we're talking about at 52 Garfield existing.

2311
03:47:10,649 --> 03:47:11,850
There's in the back the garage.

2312
03:47:12,071 --> 03:47:13,953
You barely can see it from the street existing.

2313
03:47:13,993 --> 03:47:15,195
Here's the existing driveway.

2314
03:47:15,716 --> 03:47:17,058
To the right is the gas station.

2315
03:47:18,600 --> 03:47:20,182
And if you look up the street here,

2316
03:47:20,963 --> 03:47:23,305
There are no triple-decker anythings.

2317
03:47:23,645 --> 03:47:30,269
These houses, almost honestly in the street, kind of all look the same as you go up and go up Garfield further and further.

2318
03:47:30,930 --> 03:47:33,551
The only triple-decker on the street is us.

2319
03:47:34,112 --> 03:47:35,012
So this is a...

2320
03:47:37,217 --> 03:47:39,419
A unique property, a unique situation.

2321
03:47:39,439 --> 03:47:43,403
It is unique having a 3 family in the, in the zone.

2322
03:47:43,503 --> 03:47:47,026
It's unique that we have, but this gas station, it's a unique building shape.

2323
03:47:47,786 --> 03:47:49,588
It's a unique building size.

2324
03:47:50,169 --> 03:47:53,932
It is unique having this garage that's got the finished bathroom in it.

2325
03:47:54,653 --> 03:47:56,334
And it is very different from anything else.

2326
03:47:57,675 --> 03:47:58,195
on the street.

2327
03:47:58,856 --> 03:48:11,902
I've seen other municipalities grant variances based on the existing, you know, shape and layout of the structures on a lot, and that is the case here for the reasons I stated, the L-shape of the buildings and the triple-decker.

2328
03:48:11,922 --> 03:48:18,945
I mean, the only way to harmonize the purpose and intent of the zoning and the city's housing policy with the proposal in front of you is

2329
03:48:19,925 --> 03:48:22,366
tonight to grant the special permit and the variances sought.

2330
03:48:22,446 --> 03:48:32,711
I mean, the purpose in section 94-1.1 of the Medford Zoning Ordinance is to promote health, safety, morals, convenience, and general welfare of its inhabitants.

2331
03:48:32,791 --> 03:48:37,553
And that's what this proposal is doing by providing needing housing without changing the neighborhood.

2332
03:48:38,333 --> 03:48:44,176
And the applicant asks that you approve the relief so it can then go to the Community Development Board for the special permit it needs there.

2333
03:48:44,196 --> 03:48:47,897
I mean, tonight is not the end, but we would like to be the beginning.

2334
03:48:48,278 --> 03:48:48,938
So, thank you.

2335
03:48:52,710 --> 03:48:54,831
Thank you, Attorney Gash.

2336
03:48:54,931 --> 03:48:57,092
Any questions from the board for the applicant?

2337
03:49:03,296 --> 03:49:03,496
Mike?

2338
03:49:05,297 --> 03:49:08,178
So my question is actually for the commissioner.

2339
03:49:08,258 --> 03:49:12,941
I just want to double check what I was saying earlier.

2340
03:49:13,041 --> 03:49:21,406
So I see that the applicant is requesting the rear, the variance for the rear yard setback, but why,

2341
03:49:23,030 --> 03:49:30,636
Doesn't this also require a use variance since the change in use creates a new nonconformity?

2342
03:49:34,259 --> 03:49:37,922
We went through some conversations on this, I think, back in time.

2343
03:49:38,563 --> 03:49:45,028
And we did issue some letters and emails.

2344
03:49:46,609 --> 03:49:50,673
I think he took the perspective that it was an extension of an existing use.

2345
03:49:51,983 --> 03:49:58,670
And as best as I can recall, we accepted that argument at the time because there were so many other variances that needed to be done.

2346
03:49:58,750 --> 03:50:01,052
You could look at it probably that your way as well.

2347
03:50:01,112 --> 03:50:03,955
But I think we looked at it as an acceptable way of dealing with it.

2348
03:50:05,176 --> 03:50:05,896
OK, thank you.

2349
03:50:05,916 --> 03:50:14,064
And so then I also have a question for the applicant.

2350
03:50:16,487 --> 03:50:33,841
Under the special permit criteria, you don't need to speak to hardship of not granting the special permit, but could you just speak to what would be the hardship if this garage wasn't an additional unit?

2351
03:50:35,242 --> 03:50:40,008
Well, as I said, it's already got the bathroom in it, which was there when my client bought the place, right?

2352
03:50:40,148 --> 03:50:42,211
And it doesn't have garage doors.

2353
03:50:42,231 --> 03:50:50,862
It really isn't really being used for much of anything right now because it really isn't usable for much of anything right now without some level of zoning relief.

2354
03:50:52,503 --> 03:50:54,684
And that is sort of what we've been kicking around for a while.

2355
03:50:54,704 --> 03:50:57,726
I know my client was working on this for a while before even I got involved.

2356
03:50:58,186 --> 03:51:01,207
We had an earlier application that then was withdrawn.

2357
03:51:01,227 --> 03:51:08,571
I mean, this seemed to be the best way forward to help sort of have a greater good.

2358
03:51:09,591 --> 03:51:15,856
and not change anything, rather than tearing the whole thing down and building something compliant.

2359
03:51:16,057 --> 03:51:29,308
Because the idea was to sort of reuse the building there, but the problem is the building's right on the lot lines, and there's really not a way we found that we could do much of anything without having to come before you for some variance of some sort.

2360
03:51:31,209 --> 03:51:58,333
That's the hardship we're kind of it's the problem is that I think that the purpose of all of what we're what of what Medford's trying to do is great and a lot of the communities around here are doing the same thing but the zoning ordinance sort of hasn't caught up in my opinion and so I think maybe we're a little ahead of the game on this but I think it's important that and I've seen other boards as I said and I used to sit on the zoning board in Belmont as myself so I certainly respect you know your commitment in the how late you're spending on this tonight but

2361
03:51:58,813 --> 03:52:15,319
You know, sometimes, you know, a little flexibility is necessary for the greater good, and I think that's what we're looking at here, because there's really no way to realistically utilize it productively without having some level of relief, and this just seemed to be the highest and best use for everybody.

2362
03:52:16,079 --> 03:52:16,739
Okay, thanks.

2363
03:52:17,300 --> 03:52:18,100
One last question.

2364
03:52:18,420 --> 03:52:22,902
Any luck getting in touch with the resident of 50 Garfield?

2365
03:52:23,462 --> 03:52:26,363
That seems to be the half of the

2366
03:52:27,508 --> 03:52:32,250
building on the left-hand side that's directly abutting this property.

2367
03:52:32,930 --> 03:52:41,133
Well, we did have the, let me pull up, we did have the letter of support from 48 Northfield on the left, right?

2368
03:52:42,053 --> 03:52:42,713
Yeah, exactly.

2369
03:52:42,753 --> 03:52:49,696
So it's two units and it looks like 50 is the one that kind of shares a side yard.

2370
03:52:50,096 --> 03:52:55,518
I would ask Mr. Lelaney, actually the owner, because he's the one who actually went around and spoke to his neighbors there.

2371
03:52:56,503 --> 03:53:01,265
Good evening everyone, and thank you guys for helping us with this.

2372
03:53:01,885 --> 03:53:06,487
So I did talk to Steve, who is the neighbor, and he actually owns the entire property.

2373
03:53:06,887 --> 03:53:13,290
His father had passed away about two years ago, and he was able to inherit the property.

2374
03:53:13,670 --> 03:53:16,992
His daughters live in the neighboring unit next door.

2375
03:53:17,772 --> 03:53:21,614
So at this point, it's their home, it's their entire family.

2376
03:53:23,835 --> 03:53:26,697
Yeah, that's pretty much the story for that neighbor.

2377
03:53:27,397 --> 03:53:28,037
Okay, thank you.

2378
03:53:28,057 --> 03:53:39,123
All right, any other questions from the board for the applicant?

2379
03:53:39,143 --> 03:53:47,407
All right, Board of Regents, a motion for public comment.

2380
03:53:49,568 --> 03:53:51,389
I motion to open public comment

2381
03:53:53,367 --> 03:53:53,847
Second.

2382
03:53:56,029 --> 03:53:56,349
Thank you.

2383
03:53:56,989 --> 03:53:57,370
Mary Lee.

2384
03:54:01,352 --> 03:54:04,514
Hi.

2385
03:54:05,935 --> 03:54:06,355
Hi.

2386
03:54:06,375 --> 03:54:07,316
Hi.

2387
03:54:07,336 --> 03:54:08,997
Hi.

2388
03:54:09,677 --> 03:54:11,779
I'm Jamie Thompson.

2389
03:54:11,819 --> 03:54:12,039
Hi.

2390
03:54:13,500 --> 03:54:14,921
We are open for public comment.

2391
03:54:15,001 --> 03:54:20,064
Please if anybody on the call would raise your hand or you can email.

2392
03:54:21,826 --> 03:54:26,467
Dennis McDougall at dmcdougall.net at medford-ma.gov.

2393
03:54:48,214 --> 03:54:49,494
Later we get the one that I saved.

2394
03:54:51,337 --> 03:54:55,538
Motion to close the public portion of the hearing in open deliberation.

2395
03:54:59,219 --> 03:54:59,659
I second.

2396
03:55:00,059 --> 03:55:02,420
Thank you.

2397
03:55:03,020 --> 03:55:03,520
Andrew LaRue.

2398
03:55:05,020 --> 03:55:05,140
Aye.

2399
03:55:06,361 --> 03:55:07,801
Michael Ware.

2400
03:55:07,901 --> 03:55:08,381
Aye.

2401
03:55:08,861 --> 03:55:09,601
Carmen Velas.

2402
03:55:10,681 --> 03:55:10,801
Aye.

2403
03:55:11,802 --> 03:55:12,182
Mary Lee.

2404
03:55:13,142 --> 03:55:13,262
Aye.

2405
03:55:14,282 --> 03:55:15,002
And Jamie Thompson.

2406
03:55:15,082 --> 03:55:15,142
Aye.

2407
03:55:15,162 --> 03:55:17,583
All right, what does everybody think?

2408
03:55:26,075 --> 03:55:29,438
I'm actually, um, I think it's a nice addition.

2409
03:55:30,178 --> 03:55:42,428
I think it fits that specific corner and I don't think it would be, um, yeah, that's all I have to say right now.

2410
03:55:45,651 --> 03:55:50,815
I'll just say, well, I, um, think there's some amount of ambiguity.

2411
03:55:51,035 --> 03:55:51,115
I'm.

2412
03:55:52,985 --> 03:56:01,088
comfortable accepting the interpretation that only a use variance is not required here.

2413
03:56:01,108 --> 03:56:13,533
I think if there wasn't the separate need for the variance for the new dimensional violation, then I would not be comfortable.

2414
03:56:13,593 --> 03:56:18,735
But here it's a little ambiguous in the Medford ordinance.

2415
03:56:18,815 --> 03:56:20,136
And so I think

2416
03:56:21,125 --> 03:56:25,786
maybe the special permit coupled with that variance is still consistent, 5.4.

2417
03:56:26,127 --> 03:56:31,748
Okay, thank you, Bob.

2418
03:56:36,930 --> 03:56:37,150
Andrew?

2419
03:56:38,370 --> 03:56:40,131
I'll let the building commissioner go first.

2420
03:56:41,291 --> 03:56:42,671
Commissioner?

2421
03:56:42,872 --> 03:56:47,113
I do want to comment, just following up on Mike's comment.

2422
03:56:47,173 --> 03:56:47,593
We did

2423
03:56:48,746 --> 03:56:54,316
Attorney Dash and Daniel Evans from PDS and I did go back and forth quite a bit.

2424
03:56:54,336 --> 03:57:00,308
Part of the argument was, can you extend a use to a non-joint structure?

2425
03:57:03,435 --> 03:57:07,198
which is what led it more towards a special permit than a variance.

2426
03:57:08,419 --> 03:57:12,521
So there was quite a bit of back and forth on that very conversation.

2427
03:57:12,601 --> 03:57:14,803
And that's ultimately, it's where we landed.

2428
03:57:14,823 --> 03:57:16,864
It doesn't make us right.

2429
03:57:16,944 --> 03:57:19,386
It's just where we landed as a consensus.

2430
03:57:19,446 --> 03:57:27,651
So that's all.

2431
03:57:27,711 --> 03:57:31,894
So just a couple of comments.

2432
03:57:35,137 --> 03:57:39,859
You know, I'm generally a supporter of flexibility and more housing.

2433
03:57:43,280 --> 03:57:50,463
But there's a couple of things about this that are hard for me to justify, and they are

2434
03:57:54,732 --> 03:57:58,296
That there are garages up and down the street in this neighborhood.

2435
03:57:58,837 --> 03:58:08,208
And if we allow a property owner to put in a garage unit, then there's essentially we're setting the precedent for all of them.

2436
03:58:08,869 --> 03:58:11,532
And I don't believe that the city has.

2437
03:58:12,513 --> 03:58:16,236
Has really made it a policy to do that.

2438
03:58:16,437 --> 03:58:19,419
And I know that there might be some zoning changes in the future and.

2439
03:58:20,400 --> 03:58:25,165
Concerning, you know, 80 use and and accessory structures.

2440
03:58:25,445 --> 03:58:25,725
So.

2441
03:58:25,745 --> 03:58:30,850
I mean, honestly, I prefer that policy to be in place.

2442
03:58:32,602 --> 03:58:37,424
Because otherwise, I just don't see, you know, I don't see a hardship for all of the variances.

2443
03:58:37,745 --> 03:58:50,211
And I feel like, you know, the bathroom that's in the garage was just kind of put in there, assuming that there's going to be a unit eventually for, you know, without any justification.

2444
03:58:50,231 --> 03:58:56,554
I'm also a little concerned about the fact that the, you know, the entire front yard has been hardscaped.

2445
03:58:57,374 --> 03:58:59,095
Is there parking in the front yard?

2446
03:59:01,737 --> 03:59:03,877
So why has it been hardscaped?

2447
03:59:06,218 --> 03:59:07,578
I don't know that that's hardscape.

2448
03:59:07,678 --> 03:59:08,658
I'm looking at the packet.

2449
03:59:08,858 --> 03:59:12,699
If I could share a screen again, let me grab the picture so we can at least see all what we're talking about here.

2450
03:59:17,660 --> 03:59:18,840
I don't think that's hardscape.

2451
03:59:18,960 --> 03:59:21,121
That's a yard in front, right?

2452
03:59:21,261 --> 03:59:23,421
Well, yeah, but the more recent photo is hardscape.

2453
03:59:23,441 --> 03:59:25,021
So you've actually changed that recently.

2454
03:59:30,453 --> 03:59:32,295
You were doing work on the property before.

2455
03:59:32,315 --> 03:59:34,958
I can't speak to the landscaping bit of it.

2456
03:59:35,238 --> 03:59:39,142
I can speak to the fact that that bathroom is old.

2457
03:59:39,623 --> 03:59:42,206
That bathroom isn't something that was done in anticipation of this.

2458
03:59:42,246 --> 03:59:45,469
The bathroom was there when Mr. LeLaney got the property.

2459
03:59:48,873 --> 03:59:51,855
I would also note this is a unique non-conforming three-family on the street.

2460
03:59:51,875 --> 03:59:53,636
I don't believe these others are three-families.

2461
03:59:54,177 --> 03:59:58,280
Well, right, but it's already incrementally more non-conforming.

2462
03:59:59,240 --> 04:00:09,927
I just don't understand the justification for then going up to four units when everything else is two-family in the neighborhood.

2463
04:00:09,947 --> 04:00:13,470
I mean, I'm initially going to speak to the landscaping bit.

2464
04:00:14,227 --> 04:00:14,647
Yeah, sure.

2465
04:00:14,707 --> 04:00:21,791
So, so there's a curve that we put there that divides the hardscape area that you're calling it with the paved area.

2466
04:00:22,612 --> 04:00:35,499
And so, so that is a permeable substrate, and so it doesn't affect any of the water runoff or anything like that from the property, but it also creates a clear passage for the tenants are currently living there to come and go from the property.

2467
04:00:36,250 --> 04:00:42,239
Um, and as a landlord, I am actually seeing on the ground, um, a lot of applications and a lot of people looking for studios.

2468
04:00:43,020 --> 04:00:47,287
Um, you know, I've seen people put boarding houses up and kind of rent rooms out.

2469
04:00:47,587 --> 04:00:50,512
Um, and I don't think that's the approach in Medford generally wants to take.

2470
04:00:51,320 --> 04:00:58,569
Um, I can't speak for the committee and for everybody else on the board, but, um, I generally don't think that that's, that's a safe alternative for housing.

2471
04:00:59,150 --> 04:01:05,237
Um, and I think that this does alleviate the burden of a lot of financial flexibility for people who are coming out of state.

2472
04:01:05,778 --> 04:01:08,862
Um, I have tenants who have come in from Kentucky, go to school out there.

2473
04:01:09,743 --> 04:01:09,823
Um,

2474
04:01:10,474 --> 04:01:17,041
They're looking for, you know, cheap locations, places that are like $1,000 a month, very easy to get into, very easy to get out of.

2475
04:01:17,862 --> 04:01:27,032
They don't have the commitment or the people or the resources to come into Medford and kind of work close by or go to school nearby.

2476
04:01:31,476 --> 04:01:35,818
Yeah, I'm not questioning the need for housing units of these kinds.

2477
04:01:37,499 --> 04:01:43,361
It's really like the kind of the legal and policy pieces of it that I'm questioning.

2478
04:01:43,381 --> 04:01:50,484
I don't know if Danielle has anything to add on.

2479
04:01:50,524 --> 04:01:51,504
Did you have a separate question?

2480
04:01:53,005 --> 04:01:55,846
No, I just wanted to provide some context.

2481
04:01:55,866 --> 04:01:57,727
So yeah, this has been going on a while.

2482
04:01:58,127 --> 04:01:59,188
My understanding is

2483
04:02:00,303 --> 04:02:10,806
It's been serving as a rec room, maybe an illegal unit, but illegally at some point, I'm saying before you bought it.

2484
04:02:11,166 --> 04:02:12,746
And you also said that you lived there.

2485
04:02:12,806 --> 04:02:16,587
So I didn't realize that this was an investor owner situation.

2486
04:02:17,487 --> 04:02:20,848
Because originally they wanted to do, they were asking if they could do an ADU.

2487
04:02:21,728 --> 04:02:25,809
And ADUs can only be accessory to single family dwellings.

2488
04:02:25,849 --> 04:02:27,670
You can't have an ADU for a three family.

2489
04:02:28,782 --> 04:02:33,226
So then the conversation changed to, OK, well, can we make this a fourth unit?

2490
04:02:33,266 --> 04:02:43,434
Well, it would be a fourth unit, but now it would be a principal structure and subject to the increased setbacks for a principal structure, not an accessory structure.

2491
04:02:44,014 --> 04:02:53,962
And if you want to have two principal structures, you need a special permit from the CD board, which is the SPGA board.

2492
04:02:54,923 --> 04:02:58,724
to have more than one principal structure in the single-family zones.

2493
04:03:00,685 --> 04:03:05,226
So there was many different permutations of how to do this.

2494
04:03:05,366 --> 04:03:10,848
And I'm not taking a position of whether I support it or not.

2495
04:03:10,868 --> 04:03:15,269
It was, OK, they wanted to apply for it.

2496
04:03:15,309 --> 04:03:17,710
How do we make this to be a legal unit?

2497
04:03:19,391 --> 04:03:22,291
Is it a rec room or a man cave or whatever you wanted to call it?

2498
04:03:25,060 --> 04:03:33,591
The building commissioner and I, and Adam Dash, came up with this seemed to be a path that could go to your board.

2499
04:03:33,611 --> 04:03:41,641
But finding the path doesn't mean that I support the application.

2500
04:03:41,661 --> 04:03:43,083
I'm just going to be neutral on this.

2501
04:03:44,797 --> 04:03:49,118
I would note this case has gone on for so long that Mr. Leilani did used to live there and no longer does.

2502
04:03:49,478 --> 04:03:50,999
That's how long this has been going on for.

2503
04:03:52,099 --> 04:04:02,142
And there have been some, he has informally, you know, used it, used the garage, you know, when he was living there, but not as a separate unit or anything like that.

2504
04:04:02,162 --> 04:04:04,623
I can't speak to in the way way back what was done there.

2505
04:04:04,643 --> 04:04:09,284
I mean, clearly that garage, that bathroom is not new and the bathroom was not put in by Mr. Leilani.

2506
04:04:09,884 --> 04:04:13,005
So whatever some prior owner did back in the day, I don't know.

2507
04:04:13,778 --> 04:04:17,240
It would be, if I could prove that there was a fourth unit there once, it probably would have helped our case.

2508
04:04:17,501 --> 04:04:21,423
I don't know what was there before, other than the fact that the bathroom is there.

2509
04:04:21,443 --> 04:04:26,227
I don't know, Manisha, if you have anything to add to that.

2510
04:04:28,263 --> 04:04:30,244
Yeah, so basically in the last year, I got a promotion.

2511
04:04:30,284 --> 04:04:30,765
I got a job.

2512
04:04:30,905 --> 04:04:33,946
We no longer have remote work as an opportunity.

2513
04:04:34,647 --> 04:04:35,387
I work in New Hampshire.

2514
04:04:35,427 --> 04:04:36,308
I live in New Hampshire now.

2515
04:04:37,048 --> 04:04:39,029
So that was a big life change that occurred for me.

2516
04:04:39,910 --> 04:04:43,372
So to make that adaptation, it was obviously very stressful and hard.

2517
04:04:43,432 --> 04:04:46,694
And in the background, we've had this thing going on with this dialogue.

2518
04:04:48,034 --> 04:04:52,317
So that's the explanation in terms of my residency.

2519
04:04:53,137 --> 04:04:55,419
In terms of the condition of the property and what

2520
04:04:56,980 --> 04:04:58,461
occurred before my ownership.

2521
04:04:59,102 --> 04:05:00,323
I did talk to Steve who was a neighbor.

2522
04:05:00,343 --> 04:05:04,587
He's not 100% sure if anyone's lived there.

2523
04:05:05,028 --> 04:05:09,992
He said when he was younger, growing up, he would go there all the time and hang out with his friends.

2524
04:05:10,173 --> 04:05:13,476
And I'm not sure if they would sleep there or not or use it as a unit.

2525
04:05:15,338 --> 04:05:17,259
But it sounded like a recreation room.

2526
04:05:17,280 --> 04:05:17,980
It could have been more.

2527
04:05:18,781 --> 04:05:20,823
I really can't say definitively from that conversation.

2528
04:05:24,012 --> 04:05:27,074
But it hasn't been used for car parking, you know, either.

2529
04:05:28,735 --> 04:05:30,536
You can see there's no way to even get a car into there.

2530
04:05:30,556 --> 04:05:32,217
There's not even a garage door on it anymore.

2531
04:05:35,245 --> 04:05:38,687
So we've kind of been struggling, as you can see, with what to do with this.

2532
04:05:39,488 --> 04:05:46,131
And this seemed to be the best path that we felt forward that also met the city's goals in the housing production plan.

2533
04:05:48,332 --> 04:06:01,178
And sort of in the fact that the city has these ADUs, it seemed like a way to go forward, because it's sort of a bit of a puzzle.

2534
04:06:01,198 --> 04:06:04,280
Because we're trying to keep the existing built environment.

2535
04:06:06,563 --> 04:06:06,783
Mike.

2536
04:06:07,944 --> 04:06:13,587
Yeah, so just bring this back to deliberations.

2537
04:06:14,928 --> 04:06:28,236
So the way I'm seeing it, I think in terms of detriment, probably not a lot.

2538
04:06:28,276 --> 04:06:30,097
It's next to a gas station.

2539
04:06:30,137 --> 04:06:32,179
The neighbors seem fine with it.

2540
04:06:33,079 --> 04:06:33,780
But the

2541
04:06:35,813 --> 04:06:54,249
hardship in this case, so on the one hand the inability to use this as a garage, that's a self-created hardship by the prior owner that unfortunately the law basically Mr. Mulaney inherits that self-created hardship.

2542
04:06:54,309 --> 04:06:56,732
So just because the prior owner did it doesn't

2543
04:06:57,592 --> 04:06:59,754
make it no longer self-created.

2544
04:06:59,894 --> 04:07:02,156
It's an inherited self-created hardship.

2545
04:07:02,276 --> 04:07:24,515
And then I think this next bit is a little bit, I'm not aware of direct case law examples, but I would claim that changing a use to trigger a variance and then saying that the location of the structure that

2546
04:07:25,642 --> 04:07:27,103
is then the hardship.

2547
04:07:28,304 --> 04:07:31,646
That strikes me too as a self-created hardship.

2548
04:07:31,726 --> 04:07:47,815
And I know there's cases more with subdivision where unusual lots were created by subdivision and then claimed as a hardship in the courts of rule that constitutes self-created hardship.

2549
04:07:47,855 --> 04:07:48,236
So here,

2550
04:07:49,643 --> 04:08:05,071
know, I don't really think there's a strong hardship case to be made here for the variances because the prior owner did something weird to a garage of their own choice and then, um,

2551
04:08:07,393 --> 04:08:14,078
in trying to change the use here, that's triggering the need for these variances.

2552
04:08:14,098 --> 04:08:18,262
If we didn't change the use, these variances wouldn't be required.

2553
04:08:19,603 --> 04:08:28,630
And then when I go to intent of the ordinance, the ordinance intends for ADUs to be a thing on single-family residences.

2554
04:08:29,750 --> 04:08:32,533
It intends for garages to generally be garages.

2555
04:08:32,873 --> 04:08:33,714
So I don't...

2556
04:08:35,325 --> 04:08:38,207
I'm not sure I'm at a place of comfort with this one.

2557
04:08:41,328 --> 04:09:01,839
I would note, just looking, I've got my Bobrowski out here, that it does talk about the self-created hardship, and it does quote 2K1 Lamb v. Owing Board of Appeals of Taunton from 2010, the appeals court ruling, the existence of self-created hardship does not disqualify petitioner from applying for a variance.

2558
04:09:04,080 --> 04:09:32,352
trial court ruled that this knowledge was self-created hardship which disqualified the person the appeals court reversed saying to hold otherwise would foreclose purchasers of non-conforming properties from obtaining variances regardless of other circumstances if they knew of the non-conformity at the time of the purchase and the appeals court did indicate such knowledge could be a factor in the decision making i mean you can make whatever decision you want on it i think you can take it into account and not attribute it to mr lalani but you know um you also could

2559
04:09:33,192 --> 04:09:36,714
Yeah, through the chair, I'm familiar with that one.

2560
04:09:36,974 --> 04:09:50,762
And my interpretation is essentially that in this case, the original ruling was essentially trying to penalize the property owner for the self-created hardship.

2561
04:09:50,962 --> 04:09:55,284
So it was like, well, you can't get the relief because the hardship was self-created.

2562
04:09:56,244 --> 04:09:58,886
I'm not claiming that in this case, it's more that

2563
04:10:00,605 --> 04:10:09,543
A self-created hardship is not a compelling reason in and of itself for a variant.

2564
04:10:09,563 --> 04:10:11,246
So if there's other hardships,

2565
04:10:12,775 --> 04:10:18,597
that are not self-created just because there happens to be a self-created hardship.

2566
04:10:19,257 --> 04:10:28,361
I think I'm interpreting that precedent as really reinforcing that in those circumstances, a board maybe rightly should grant variances.

2567
04:10:28,441 --> 04:10:42,086
But in a case where the hardship itself in its entirety is perhaps self-created, I'm not sure that precedent really applies.

2568
04:10:44,082 --> 04:10:45,644
It's an interesting discussion for sure.

2569
04:10:45,744 --> 04:10:53,292
I mean, I would go back to Chapter 48, Section 10 about how variances can be owing to circumstances relating to the structures on the lot.

2570
04:10:54,132 --> 04:10:59,258
Way back in the day, someone built structures in this fashion, but I don't know that that self-creates a hardship.

2571
04:10:59,298 --> 04:11:02,521
I mean, the garage was built on the lot line.

2572
04:11:03,041 --> 04:11:04,363
The garage is on the lot line.

2573
04:11:05,863 --> 04:11:12,285
I can't do anything about the garage being on the lot line or the fact that the garage is that close to the house or the other variances that we're seeking.

2574
04:11:13,926 --> 04:11:17,487
And the fact that it's just very difficult because nothing is changing.

2575
04:11:18,027 --> 04:11:19,928
And I think the neighbors like that nothing is changing.

2576
04:11:20,268 --> 04:11:26,309
We can make a nice compliant project if we tore everything down, but I think the neighbors would probably get upset and that doesn't help Medford or anybody.

2577
04:11:27,790 --> 04:11:31,131
Nor is it great for the environment to be wasting a perfectly good structure like that.

2578
04:11:31,691 --> 04:11:39,239
So, we're just trying to sort of, I mean, the hardship is this situation that we're in with the structures as they're laid out on that lot.

2579
04:11:40,620 --> 04:11:48,408
And the fact that we have a very large, you know, triple decker with a garage back in the corner like that, that's the other part of it.

2580
04:11:50,807 --> 04:11:58,091
And we've, as Danielle said correctly, and as the commissioner said correctly, we've been, this has been kicked around for even longer than I've been involved in the case, which has been some time now.

2581
04:11:58,171 --> 04:12:02,273
And it's been very difficult to figure out what to do with this property.

2582
04:12:02,473 --> 04:12:12,558
And this seemed to be a way that the neighbors liked and we could work with and everybody could work with that meets the purpose of the zoning and meets the housing production plan and sort of hits a lot of goals.

2583
04:12:13,438 --> 04:12:21,183
And I guess I would just ask that, in light of all of that, to have some flexibility or creativity with this one.

2584
04:12:21,223 --> 04:12:27,768
It is a unique oddball on the street, being up against the gas station and all of that and being shoved back in the corner.

2585
04:12:27,788 --> 04:12:30,970
And nobody else has our situation on that street, as I showed you the picture.

2586
04:12:31,010 --> 04:12:33,132
So I don't think what precedent there would be.

2587
04:12:33,192 --> 04:12:33,792
There's no one else.

2588
04:12:33,852 --> 04:12:36,094
They have garages, but they don't have what we've got.

2589
04:12:36,834 --> 04:12:41,017
So it is kind of a weird, unique situation, which is kind of what variances are for.

2590
04:12:41,398 --> 04:12:43,724
I'm sorry, just what do you mean what we've got?

2591
04:12:43,805 --> 04:12:47,615
Like there's garages up and down the street, but yours is different in what way?

2592
04:12:48,500 --> 04:12:50,381
The garage is up against the gas station.

2593
04:12:50,401 --> 04:12:53,542
It's shoved in the back, and we've got a triple-decker on the lot.

2594
04:12:54,123 --> 04:12:58,765
Our layout on the lot of everything is not the same as everybody else's.

2595
04:12:59,485 --> 04:13:01,686
So we are sort of an oddball.

2596
04:13:02,246 --> 04:13:06,228
As I showed you, we're a unique structure in that neighborhood.

2597
04:13:06,308 --> 04:13:10,070
And being in this SF2 zone, I don't even know why it's in the SF2 zone, but it is.

2598
04:13:10,850 --> 04:13:13,211
So, I mean, there's really no way...

2599
04:13:15,572 --> 04:13:18,058
If it were a single family house, then we could do an ADU, right?

2600
04:13:18,078 --> 04:13:20,944
I mean, but it's not because we're not like everybody else on the street.

2601
04:13:21,605 --> 04:13:23,589
So we're sort of stuck in this situation.

2602
04:13:24,170 --> 04:13:24,371
Right.

2603
04:13:24,431 --> 04:13:25,974
But I guess my big problem is

2604
04:13:28,353 --> 04:13:32,196
I live within walking distance of this property, so I'm very familiar with the neighborhood.

2605
04:13:32,357 --> 04:13:39,223
I walk these streets a lot, and I know that they're all basically two families.

2606
04:13:39,864 --> 04:13:42,626
Many of them have garages.

2607
04:13:44,428 --> 04:13:49,953
If we grant this, how can we not grant it for every other property on the street?

2608
04:13:50,114 --> 04:13:50,994
That would seem to be

2609
04:13:52,242 --> 04:14:09,858
making a policy that the city doesn't have so I, my question for, you know, Director hunter or Danielle would be, I don't you know this is the first time I've seen this project so I know you've talked about, you have a big history here but I maybe I need to understand a little bit more of that history like what

2610
04:14:11,112 --> 04:14:13,314
What are the other things that have been done?

2611
04:14:13,514 --> 04:14:16,957
Why is this the only path forward here?

2612
04:14:17,378 --> 04:14:22,662
And also, from the city's perspective, is this a policy we want to encourage?

2613
04:14:32,675 --> 04:14:35,936
So it is a path that they can apply for.

2614
04:14:36,156 --> 04:14:39,037
Basically, I can't tell people not to apply for things.

2615
04:14:39,577 --> 04:14:41,178
They really wanted to apply for it.

2616
04:14:41,258 --> 04:14:42,458
I said, keep it a rec room.

2617
04:14:43,259 --> 04:14:44,679
And they really wanted to.

2618
04:14:44,919 --> 04:14:46,920
You can't tell someone they can't apply for something.

2619
04:14:47,300 --> 04:14:49,901
So take your chances with the board.

2620
04:14:50,481 --> 04:14:52,062
This was an avenue.

2621
04:14:52,622 --> 04:14:58,504
So I didn't say that they could meet the tests to have it granted.

2622
04:14:59,064 --> 04:15:01,405
But it was something that they could apply for.

2623
04:15:02,844 --> 04:15:05,785
to have a fourth unit.

2624
04:15:06,145 --> 04:15:08,627
It was just, there was a way.

2625
04:15:08,647 --> 04:15:12,268
There seemed to be different ways you could come at it.

2626
04:15:15,510 --> 04:15:30,136
I try not to have people apply for long shots if I think it's a long shot, but this was a piston hitting my inbox for the last, I think it was maybe last summer we started talking about this.

2627
04:15:30,156 --> 04:15:30,956
I think it was the summer.

2628
04:15:32,578 --> 04:15:39,985
So we just, again, I was just really surprised it ever made it on the agenda.

2629
04:15:40,666 --> 04:15:45,670
I thought it went away at one point, but sorry, it's really late and I'm getting loopy.

2630
04:15:47,312 --> 04:15:58,302
But I didn't say it was a path to get approved, but it was, this is the bazillion things you need relief from if you wish to apply here you go.

2631
04:16:00,199 --> 04:16:03,981
basically what the story is for this.

2632
04:16:05,742 --> 04:16:14,067
So a lot of relief for not changing anything really on the ground.

2633
04:16:15,487 --> 04:16:25,653
I wouldn't say this is necessarily a precedence for all the other garages, since the abutters for the principal structure, which would be the garage that would turn into a studio, would be a commercial lot and then

2634
04:16:26,700 --> 04:16:27,601
the other three family.

2635
04:16:28,101 --> 04:16:35,187
So there's not a lot of situations on the street that have that scenario where they get sandwiched between a commercial lot and another residency.

2636
04:16:37,188 --> 04:16:40,110
And the other residency happens to be the three family.

2637
04:16:40,391 --> 04:16:48,877
So anyone who were to pass down the driveway up and down, it wouldn't affect any of the abutters for that principal structure, if that makes any sense in legal terms.

2638
04:16:48,897 --> 04:16:52,220
Thank you.

2639
04:16:52,320 --> 04:16:52,760
Chris, go ahead.

2640
04:16:54,769 --> 04:16:55,970
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

2641
04:16:56,130 --> 04:17:11,097
Yeah, I know, well, it is late, and I just offered this one thing that I know neighboring communities have looked into, what is essentially an accessory work unit, if you will, although it's not usually referred to it as that.

2642
04:17:12,177 --> 04:17:21,021
But there is a lot of need for smaller workspaces, and it may have a less, and I don't even know, we don't have that in the zoning code

2643
04:17:22,022 --> 04:17:34,731
So I'm not sure how that would work, but there are certainly instances where people are looking for small workspaces, which may not have the burden of a housing unit, for instance.

2644
04:17:46,230 --> 04:17:49,291
Any other discussion from the board?

2645
04:17:49,371 --> 04:17:54,653
I would love to hear what Mary and yourself, Jamie, think about this.

2646
04:17:59,215 --> 04:18:05,938
For me, I see the value in adding additional units in the city.

2647
04:18:05,978 --> 04:18:06,798
We do need housing.

2648
04:18:07,615 --> 04:18:17,544
I did look at this from an ADU perspective, but I am challenged because the goal of ADUs is single-family lots, where you're not in a multifamily environment.

2649
04:18:21,348 --> 04:18:26,392
I do feel that the variances don't exist until you issue the special permit.

2650
04:18:26,412 --> 04:18:31,757
So we are creating the hardship by issuing a special permit.

2651
04:18:38,152 --> 04:18:50,298
For me, I do see the value in adding units where this is a three-family, but it is a single SF2 zone.

2652
04:18:50,878 --> 04:19:01,363
Again, the question of this property sitting in this zone to begin with, it was developed at some point.

2653
04:19:07,065 --> 04:19:19,078
It is a challenge for me to move forward with this based on all the maneuvering to make it happen.

2654
04:19:35,612 --> 04:19:37,853
I'm in a motion to approve the requested release.

2655
04:19:37,873 --> 04:19:58,567
I mean if it would help I mean I I'm sorry I didn't mean to if I could just before you vote and I don't know Monish if you wanted if it would help if you want us to go back and you know see what we can come up with to make you more comfortable with it we'd be willing to do that at a future meeting certainly however the board wants to take it of course.

2656
04:20:00,917 --> 04:20:06,562
I'm sorry, I was having trouble with the zoom, but I do want to say something because.

2657
04:20:08,112 --> 04:20:20,337
I feel like the request is asking us to recognize a garage as a housing dwelling.

2658
04:20:21,198 --> 04:20:26,240
And I tend to agree with Andre and Mike.

2659
04:20:28,180 --> 04:20:33,403
I don't think I'm at the point of recognizing that structure there as illegal.

2660
04:20:34,363 --> 04:20:34,863
dwelling.

2661
04:20:35,724 --> 04:20:39,807
And I feel like that's what you're all asking us to do.

2662
04:20:39,827 --> 04:20:46,532
I mean, there must be other alternatives for the use of that structure.

2663
04:20:46,552 --> 04:20:59,541
I mean, have you ever thought of other alternatives rather than just asking us through this application to recognize that as a fourth unit dwelling?

2664
04:21:01,843 --> 04:21:04,586
Yes, through the chair, I mean, we have talked about things.

2665
04:21:04,606 --> 04:21:07,027
I don't think that there's anything that's by right.

2666
04:21:07,648 --> 04:21:21,859
I think we're going to be back in front of somebody to get some relief for something as we've kicked around a number of things because, you know, if you attach it to the main house, then you are having your principal structure too close to the lot line and you're back at the variance.

2667
04:21:21,899 --> 04:21:26,963
I mean, we don't, we end up with the same sort of go around, circle your problem with this.

2668
04:21:28,564 --> 04:21:38,470
I guess unless you just put a lawnmower in it and called it a day, which seems like a bit of a waste, but for a space that's not, that's sort of, you know, usable for other things.

2669
04:21:38,590 --> 04:21:48,356
But, I mean, we could go back and talk about it some more if that's the board's, you know, desire, because I know it is getting late tonight.

2670
04:21:49,356 --> 04:21:51,057
But however you want to handle it.

2671
04:21:57,547 --> 04:21:58,227
What did you say Mike?

2672
04:21:58,327 --> 04:21:58,887
I didn't hear that.

2673
04:21:59,688 --> 04:22:02,269
Motion to approve the requested release.

2674
04:22:05,750 --> 04:22:07,591
And we were asking to see if we could continue it.

2675
04:22:11,952 --> 04:22:21,456
I guess I'm interested to know what the board is looking for to satisfy the needs of the community and what their expectations are to increase their studio housing in the community.

2676
04:22:23,460 --> 04:22:26,801
And what I'm seeing in Medford is a lot of people are buying one-bedroom houses.

2677
04:22:27,322 --> 04:22:28,262
They're doing a lot of additions.

2678
04:22:28,282 --> 04:22:31,283
They'll make them into two or three-bedroom houses after they've owned them for a few years.

2679
04:22:32,364 --> 04:22:35,085
And then they end up selling these houses that are three-bedroom houses.

2680
04:22:35,285 --> 04:22:38,326
And now there's no more one-bedroom houses in the community for people to buy.

2681
04:22:39,987 --> 04:22:45,229
Converting a garage into a studio kind of locks that into that framework.

2682
04:22:45,449 --> 04:22:50,971
And you kind of put it into a position where it's not possible to expand a studio and a garage.

2683
04:22:51,071 --> 04:22:52,852
It's always going to be a studio as a garage.

2684
04:22:53,605 --> 04:22:55,546
and it's always gonna be the community as a studio.

2685
04:22:56,326 --> 04:23:01,627
There won't be a developer who comes in and makes it into a three bedroom or tears it down and makes a townhouse.

2686
04:23:01,827 --> 04:23:03,288
It's never gonna become that.

2687
04:23:04,988 --> 04:23:14,271
So in light of that, I think that that's an interesting piece of information just because of the structure itself.

2688
04:23:14,931 --> 04:23:20,832
So just wanted to add that.

2689
04:23:21,793 --> 04:23:23,033
I second Mike's motion.

2690
04:23:32,920 --> 04:23:34,881
I'm sorry, did Mike just continue it?

2691
04:23:35,181 --> 04:23:36,321
My Zoom skipped out.

2692
04:23:36,341 --> 04:23:38,302
It's a motion.

2693
04:23:38,322 --> 04:23:39,263
Mike made a motion.

2694
04:23:44,265 --> 04:23:45,406
You both talked over each other.

2695
04:23:45,426 --> 04:23:46,706
I didn't catch that.

2696
04:23:48,927 --> 04:23:51,368
Mike made a motion to approve and Mary seconded.

2697
04:23:51,388 --> 04:23:54,030
So I'm going to say yes.

2698
04:23:57,471 --> 04:24:00,913
The variances or the special permit, which one are you approving?

2699
04:24:01,833 --> 04:24:05,155
All of them.

2700
04:24:05,275 --> 04:24:13,158
I believe we have to go through the special permits one by one because the variances don't exist until we approve the special permit.

2701
04:24:13,739 --> 04:24:18,101
May I ask a point of information to the chair, maybe to one of the lawyers?

2702
04:24:18,141 --> 04:24:18,361
Yes.

2703
04:24:21,747 --> 04:24:35,050
So if this were to be approved as two principal structures on one lot, does that mean they could be, then the lot could be subdivided and then sold separately?

2704
04:24:35,070 --> 04:24:38,651
I would think the lot is not large enough to do that.

2705
04:24:39,251 --> 04:24:47,513
And I'll also note that no matter what, if you voted to approve all this, we would still have to go to the Community Development Board for a special permit to have two principal structures on one lot.

2706
04:24:48,573 --> 04:24:54,358
approving this here tonight would not end the approval process.

2707
04:24:54,418 --> 04:25:00,983
Point of order, Jamie, if you want to rule my motion out of order and start with the one that went fine.

2708
04:25:01,063 --> 04:25:03,424
Yeah, we have to continue the vote.

2709
04:25:03,785 --> 04:25:07,387
All right, yeah, so we'll rule that motion out of order.

2710
04:25:07,407 --> 04:25:15,053
All right, motion, and so you want to do the special permit first, is that what I said?

2711
04:25:16,583 --> 04:25:20,925
The first item would be the special permit for a three to four unit.

2712
04:25:21,545 --> 04:25:24,026
OK, motion to approve this special permit.

2713
04:25:25,826 --> 04:25:26,186
Second.

2714
04:25:26,226 --> 04:25:29,267
All right, roll call.

2715
04:25:29,387 --> 04:25:30,028
Yvette Velez?

2716
04:25:32,008 --> 04:25:32,248
Yes.

2717
04:25:33,989 --> 04:25:34,589
Michael Darin?

2718
04:25:35,209 --> 04:25:35,429
No.

2719
04:25:37,770 --> 04:25:38,230
Mary Lee?

2720
04:25:39,091 --> 04:25:39,331
No.

2721
04:25:41,111 --> 04:25:41,672
Andrea Leo?

2722
04:25:42,572 --> 04:25:42,792
No.

2723
04:25:44,813 --> 04:25:45,473
Jamie Thompson?

2724
04:25:45,713 --> 04:25:45,793
No.

2725
04:25:50,709 --> 04:25:55,092
We do not need to proceed with the other votes because they don't exist without that special grant.

2726
04:25:58,894 --> 04:26:00,795
All right.

2727
04:26:01,135 --> 04:26:07,579
Attorney Dash, would you... We don't need a draft, I apologize.

2728
04:26:09,401 --> 04:26:09,601
Nope.

2729
04:26:09,661 --> 04:26:10,941
I'll get it.

2730
04:26:12,883 --> 04:26:13,503
Thank you, Jones.

2731
04:26:14,544 --> 04:26:17,986
All right, well, thank you for the consideration.

2732
04:26:20,003 --> 04:26:21,804
Can I just ask the board a question?

2733
04:26:21,884 --> 04:26:32,127
I am genuinely curious how the public city plans, because as an individual who owns multiple properties in the city, I'm curious how would they solve that problem of having student use?

2734
04:26:32,407 --> 04:26:34,787
You can talk with city officials outside of this public meeting.

2735
04:26:36,128 --> 04:26:36,228
OK.

2736
04:26:40,665 --> 04:26:41,986
May I, Jamie?

2737
04:26:42,347 --> 04:26:44,629
I would invite you, you can reach out to our office.

2738
04:26:44,649 --> 04:26:58,360
I don't know if you have Danielle's contact, she can pass along mine, that we can, the planning office, we can, because we actually do want to talk to property owners in the city about future zoning changes.

2739
04:26:58,420 --> 04:27:00,101
So you're welcome to reach out to our office.

2740
04:27:00,882 --> 04:27:02,824
Okay, thank you.

2741
04:27:02,844 --> 04:27:06,487
Yeah, I would just hate to see the city have boarding houses everywhere with bedrooms rented out individually.

2742
04:27:07,127 --> 04:27:09,249
I've seen six bedroom houses rented out that way,

2743
04:27:10,411 --> 04:27:15,073
It's a fire hazard, it's a safety issue, it's a liability for a homeowner.

2744
04:27:15,634 --> 04:27:17,134
I think illegal.

2745
04:27:17,695 --> 04:27:19,015
And it's illegal too, right?

2746
04:27:19,075 --> 04:27:25,218
But it is being done and it's vulnerable, kind of what you said, so.

2747
04:27:26,539 --> 04:27:29,300
Thank you.

2748
04:27:29,360 --> 04:27:32,482
That's my fear.

2749
04:27:35,163 --> 04:27:39,265
And I believe that is all our cases, Dennis, administrative items?

2750
04:27:43,130 --> 04:27:47,072
Nothing for in terms of admin stuff for tonight, I think.

2751
04:27:50,034 --> 04:28:01,139
The only really other thing is the meeting minutes I sent you, but I don't know if you had enough time to review them or not, but that's pretty much the last thing I can think of.

2752
04:28:01,179 --> 04:28:05,942
Just for the board, did everybody have a chance to review the minutes that Dennis sent out?

2753
04:28:10,830 --> 04:28:18,533
I had a chance to review them, and I also watched a recording of the meeting, but I wasn't physically present.

2754
04:28:18,653 --> 04:28:23,695
So ideally, someone who is physically present must also review them.

2755
04:28:27,316 --> 04:28:34,059
Has everybody had a chance to review the 328 minutes?

2756
04:28:34,679 --> 04:28:35,439
Jim's not present.

2757
04:28:35,459 --> 04:28:36,800
Do we have to wait for him to be present?

2758
04:28:38,062 --> 04:28:42,503
And then we can continue because I. And I wasn't there.

2759
04:28:42,563 --> 04:28:42,803
Yeah.

2760
04:28:43,923 --> 04:28:46,704
Yeah, and Jim's not here, so we only have 4 people.

2761
04:28:48,144 --> 04:28:49,984
Well, I continue those to the next meeting.

2762
04:28:51,024 --> 04:28:51,484
Just right.

2763
04:28:51,965 --> 04:28:56,165
Oh, I actually just do 1 other last thing is that I sent out some decisions for signatures.

2764
04:28:56,225 --> 04:28:59,846
So if you can get on that tonight or tomorrow morning, that would be helpful.

2765
04:28:59,866 --> 04:29:02,046
So I can file them tomorrow in the clerk's office.

2766
04:29:03,067 --> 04:29:05,247
If you haven't done it already, please do so.

2767
04:29:08,349 --> 04:29:08,809
Thank you, Thomas.

2768
04:29:09,991 --> 04:29:10,791
Motion to adjourn.

2769
04:29:12,293 --> 04:29:12,693
Thank you.

2770
04:29:14,134 --> 04:29:14,495
Second.

2771
04:29:15,836 --> 04:29:17,257
Thank you, Mayor.

2772
04:29:17,297 --> 04:29:19,159
We will do roll that the rest.

2773
04:29:20,840 --> 04:29:21,121
Yes.

2774
04:29:22,402 --> 04:29:22,962
Andrew.

2775
04:29:23,663 --> 04:29:23,783
Aye.

2776
04:29:25,445 --> 04:29:25,885
Mayor Lee.

2777
04:29:26,886 --> 04:29:26,986
Aye.

2778
04:29:28,107 --> 04:29:28,648
Michael there.

2779
04:29:29,328 --> 04:29:29,448
Aye.

2780
04:29:30,669 --> 04:29:31,630
And Jamie Thompson, aye.

2781
04:29:32,211 --> 04:29:34,393
Thank you everybody for your patience and have a good night.
