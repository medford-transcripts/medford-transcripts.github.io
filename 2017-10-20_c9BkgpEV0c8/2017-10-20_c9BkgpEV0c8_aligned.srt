1
00:00:05,602 --> 00:00:15,365
Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Paul Donato, and I'm the chairman of the Democratic Warden City Committee, along with my co-chair, Nancy Denise White.

2
00:00:16,145 --> 00:00:33,231
So we want to welcome all of you who are here, and we want to welcome those who are watching on television for the opportunity to hear both the mayor and her challenger, Mayor Burke, and her challenger, David McKillop.

3
00:00:34,324 --> 00:00:40,665
This is an important forum, and Henry will explain the forum to both of the candidates.

4
00:00:41,026 --> 00:00:53,128
But I just wanted to give this opportunity to say how proud we are of Ward 6 and the members of the Ward 6 Democratic Committee who put this together, particularly Henry Miller.

5
00:00:53,188 --> 00:00:55,809
And so I want to thank you, Henry, for what you have done.

6
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:02,050
Thank you.

7
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:03,691
So on behalf of the Ward and the City Committee,

8
00:01:04,945 --> 00:01:07,387
and the Ward 6 Committee that put this together.

9
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:14,012
We'll now turn it over to Julia, who will lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag of the United States, and then to Henry.

10
00:01:14,573 --> 00:01:16,814
If you'd like to stand up, face the flag.

11
00:01:17,275 --> 00:01:18,295
I think we all know this.

12
00:01:18,315 --> 00:01:19,096
You can say it with me.

13
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:26,422
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America.

14
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:35,373
under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

15
00:01:35,993 --> 00:01:36,353
Thank you.

16
00:01:36,413 --> 00:01:36,994
You can be seated.

17
00:01:37,814 --> 00:01:38,174
OK, welcome.

18
00:01:38,535 --> 00:01:38,995
Go ahead.

19
00:01:39,315 --> 00:01:39,535
OK.

20
00:01:40,256 --> 00:01:42,597
Now, you heard Paul.

21
00:01:43,037 --> 00:01:46,239
Thank you for showing up and giving up your beautiful Thursday.

22
00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:48,561
I know you'll be home watching Scandal or something.

23
00:01:49,241 --> 00:01:50,462
But we got to do this one.

24
00:01:52,483 --> 00:01:54,945
The vote that we cast as citizens are important.

25
00:01:55,985 --> 00:02:00,268
In most cases, we leave after casting them for two years, four years, six years.

26
00:02:02,562 --> 00:02:12,327
The decision to vote always have an impact on the way we live our life, on the way things gone throughout our community.

27
00:02:13,788 --> 00:02:18,411
One thing for sure we choose to do, we wanted to have a debate, there's not enough time to do it.

28
00:02:19,411 --> 00:02:24,134
We wanted to do a candidate forum, there's not enough time to do it.

29
00:02:25,555 --> 00:02:30,097
Because we reach out to the entire community, I personally sent

30
00:02:30,883 --> 00:02:33,004
contacted 250 people.

31
00:02:34,465 --> 00:02:35,705
I couldn't get questions.

32
00:02:36,045 --> 00:02:37,526
But believe it, they have problems.

33
00:02:37,566 --> 00:02:38,346
They have issues.

34
00:02:39,127 --> 00:02:50,092
So we had to use our own head, put together something that will give you, member of this community, citizen of Medford, hearing from the candidate.

35
00:02:50,152 --> 00:02:55,935
We sent to them base question, base matters, base issues.

36
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:57,115
That will give them.

37
00:02:57,155 --> 00:02:58,496
And they both have the same thing.

38
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,800
to help them out.

39
00:03:01,461 --> 00:03:12,924
So I will let my co-moderator to introduce the candidate, because our first event for the night, we're already chipping on the hours, is the mayor candidate.

40
00:03:13,464 --> 00:03:15,265
We have two candidates.

41
00:03:15,365 --> 00:03:18,646
I'll let my co-moderator, Julia, to do that.

42
00:03:19,426 --> 00:03:21,106
Do we know the order that they picked?

43
00:03:21,186 --> 00:03:21,706
We don't know yet.

44
00:03:21,767 --> 00:03:22,567
Dave goes first.

45
00:03:24,487 --> 00:03:24,927
Oh, OK.

46
00:03:27,643 --> 00:03:30,204
So all right, we first have David McKillop.

47
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:34,145
And Stephanie Muccini-Burke.

48
00:03:52,325 --> 00:03:56,486
So as Henry said, um, we were unable to get enough questions from the community.

49
00:03:56,626 --> 00:04:08,009
So we decided that in lieu of a question and answer session, uh, we sent a list of issues, both via email and mail to the two candidates and giving them an opportunity to prepare statements addressing all of these issues.

50
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:12,091
So, um, and who was going to go first was chosen by lottery.

51
00:04:12,111 --> 00:04:13,751
And I still haven't heard Dave's going first.

52
00:04:13,931 --> 00:04:15,692
I hadn't heard who's going first yet between the two of them.

53
00:04:16,392 --> 00:04:16,912
Um, so,

54
00:04:17,547 --> 00:04:23,570
They will each have 15 minutes, the same amount of time, to address the issues that we presented to them in advance of tonight.

55
00:04:26,271 --> 00:04:26,351
OK.

56
00:04:26,411 --> 00:04:26,931
It's easy.

57
00:04:27,491 --> 00:04:30,453
Like Julia said, the same issue we'll share.

58
00:04:30,753 --> 00:04:31,993
Everybody have the same thing.

59
00:04:32,033 --> 00:04:33,194
There's nothing different.

60
00:04:33,854 --> 00:04:36,075
We have in front of us the two timekeeper.

61
00:04:36,155 --> 00:04:37,196
We make sure we do it.

62
00:04:38,196 --> 00:04:44,899
Because when you have one timekeeper, they usually fall asleep, and they don't get the time right.

63
00:04:44,999 --> 00:04:46,800
So it's not like we don't trust.

64
00:04:47,423 --> 00:04:48,907
one, but we want to make sure we do.

65
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,536
Each of them will have, as mayor candidate, 15 minutes.

66
00:04:58,029 --> 00:05:01,410
And when they have, when they have, what is it, 15 seconds left?

67
00:05:02,151 --> 00:05:02,891
I want to do that one part.

68
00:05:03,751 --> 00:05:05,712
So I will introduce, well, I would introduce the candidates.

69
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:08,373
We'll explain the procedures and the rules.

70
00:05:08,413 --> 00:05:09,934
We'll assist the timekeeper as needed.

71
00:05:10,654 --> 00:05:12,115
And the moderator's decision is final.

72
00:05:12,155 --> 00:05:13,635
So they will be given a strict time.

73
00:05:13,755 --> 00:05:18,137
The timekeepers will give them a little yellow flag when they have, I believe it's 15 seconds left.

74
00:05:18,157 --> 00:05:18,917
That's your 15 second warning.

75
00:05:21,451 --> 00:05:25,355
And then the red when it goes up, and Henry has the power to turn off the microphone.

76
00:05:26,275 --> 00:05:27,737
I get the magic hand.

77
00:05:27,877 --> 00:05:28,417
15 minutes.

78
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:31,460
Now, another thing to the audience I will ask you.

79
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,703
I know we favor one candidate over another.

80
00:05:34,923 --> 00:05:35,483
We all do.

81
00:05:35,904 --> 00:05:36,304
We vote.

82
00:05:37,025 --> 00:05:43,350
But one of the things you have to do, save your, you know, applause until both of them

83
00:05:44,915 --> 00:05:48,656
address you, then we can share that with them.

84
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:49,916
And I'm counting on you.

85
00:05:49,956 --> 00:05:50,916
I know you'll follow that.

86
00:05:51,016 --> 00:05:51,376
Thank you.

87
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:55,377
Since they only have 15 minutes to intersperse, applause would actually take up time.

88
00:05:55,437 --> 00:05:59,618
So out of respecting their time, we just ask you to hold your applause and give a rousing applause at the end.

89
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:00,759
All right.

90
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:06,000
Mrs. David, you were choosing to go first because you pick up number one, right?

91
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:06,660
I believe.

92
00:06:09,073 --> 00:06:13,296
Your mic will be coming up as that's a mic in the middle right now.

93
00:06:13,617 --> 00:06:15,939
And am I close enough that it still can be heard?

94
00:06:16,299 --> 00:06:17,900
Can you guys hear him talking?

95
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,061
Can you guys hear me well?

96
00:06:19,582 --> 00:06:19,922
You don't.

97
00:06:20,903 --> 00:06:21,963
I will project.

98
00:06:22,124 --> 00:06:23,024
Can you hear me better?

99
00:06:23,044 --> 00:06:27,248
I'll give you this one.

100
00:06:27,268 --> 00:06:27,328
OK.

101
00:06:28,509 --> 00:06:30,050
Actually, no, I think I'll be fine.

102
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,771
I'd rather just go there.

103
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:32,752
Thank you very much, Henry.

104
00:06:32,772 --> 00:06:33,593
I appreciate it, though.

105
00:06:33,933 --> 00:06:34,274
Thank you.

106
00:06:34,614 --> 00:06:36,956
You'll need it for the TV recording, sir.

107
00:06:36,976 --> 00:06:37,216
It will?

108
00:06:39,401 --> 00:06:39,621
Okay.

109
00:06:41,622 --> 00:06:41,822
All right.

110
00:06:47,684 --> 00:06:48,004
Hello.

111
00:06:48,124 --> 00:06:48,705
Can you hear me now?

112
00:06:50,705 --> 00:06:52,646
Never, never good to put a microphone in my hands.

113
00:06:52,786 --> 00:06:53,507
I promise you that.

114
00:06:54,367 --> 00:07:01,610
So we went into the room with Neil Osborne, and Neil had a really great, very technical system to get us started.

115
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,151
It was a paper bag and two pieces of paper.

116
00:07:04,671 --> 00:07:05,271
Thank you, Neil.

117
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:06,552
It was really hard work.

118
00:07:09,413 --> 00:07:11,294
Anyway, good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

119
00:07:11,314 --> 00:07:15,855
Thank you, everyone, for taking the time out of your busy schedules to come here to speak with us.

120
00:07:16,575 --> 00:07:18,396
Well, to speak about us.

121
00:07:20,797 --> 00:07:30,660
I want to thank all of the Medford Ward 6 committee, especially Henry Milleran, Bruce Kulik, Christy Evita, and a special thanks to Paul Donato for hosting this evening tonight.

122
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:35,181
My name is Dave McKillop, Sr., and I'm running for mayor of this great city.

123
00:07:36,343 --> 00:07:47,779
I'm married to my wife of 26 years, Lisa Marchino-McKillop, and we have resided in North Medford for the same amount of time, where we raised our four children, David Jr., who is here tonight hiding in the back.

124
00:07:49,132 --> 00:07:53,915
my daughter Teresa, Matthew, and Anthony, all of whom have gone through the Medford school system.

125
00:07:54,856 --> 00:08:04,582
Although my work experiences have taken me outside of the city limits for most of my adult life, it does not lend credence to the notion that I do not have a vested interest in my own hometown.

126
00:08:05,103 --> 00:08:06,764
In fact, it's quite the opposite.

127
00:08:07,604 --> 00:08:10,886
I apologize that I'm going to keep turning, but this is a very awkward situation to be in.

128
00:08:12,135 --> 00:08:18,701
It gives me the unique opportunity to take what great ideas and ways of doing business that I've learned in several different states and apply it here.

129
00:08:19,522 --> 00:08:25,046
It has given me insight to varying labor laws and ways to work within their parameters, policies, and procedures.

130
00:08:25,807 --> 00:08:38,698
I've experienced many different cultures and ways of thinking from city to city, giving me coping mechanisms to maximize the best results working with individuals as well as varying groups in individual cities or towns.

131
00:08:39,773 --> 00:08:45,978
I've learned over the years the art of collaboration and how it can foster true creativity and excellent outcomes.

132
00:08:46,498 --> 00:08:48,920
And above all else, I've been true to who I am.

133
00:08:49,641 --> 00:08:53,003
Those who know me best will tell you I'm a man of my word.

134
00:08:53,904 --> 00:08:58,427
I'm a man that will stick to a code of ethics even though it may not benefit me in getting ahead.

135
00:08:58,988 --> 00:09:05,773
And I'm a firm believer that we are all on the same playing field of life and that no one deserves to be treated any less than anyone else.

136
00:09:06,855 --> 00:09:18,963
In over 30 years of running businesses up and down the East Coast, most notably my own last 15 years of owning a business, I accumulated a parallel amount of knowledge that works well with running a municipality.

137
00:09:20,825 --> 00:09:30,011
Managing and creating budgets for many years, ranging from $1 million to $100 million, I can set up and break down a budget to see where the opportunities lie.

138
00:09:31,354 --> 00:09:46,660
Being my own budget director for my business, I've created and implemented countless budgets, as well as cash flow plans and P&Ls, allowing me to understand the terminology of a budget and where to look for unbalanced monies or inaccurate spending.

139
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:55,643
As a negotiator for many vendors and insurance contracts, I have a keen insight to current issues on negotiating labor contracts.

140
00:09:56,602 --> 00:10:06,031
My commitment is I will never walk away from a negotiation if it makes more sense on both sides to find common ground financially and collaboratively.

141
00:10:07,672 --> 00:10:21,945
I have a long history of taking on and completing large business projects that involved major expansion and business startups, which in turn has given me a unique set of skills needed to complete any project, large or small, for example, the master plan.

142
00:10:23,312 --> 00:10:31,781
This takes good communication, collaboration, planning, timing, and sometimes, and not often addressed, follow-up.

143
00:10:32,863 --> 00:10:38,125
hiring, training, and developing over 5,000 employees in my 30 plus years of running businesses.

144
00:10:39,446 --> 00:10:46,409
I developed a follow-up tools to ensure the success of individuals, for example, performance evaluation and action plans.

145
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:50,991
This is crucial to the overall morale of any work environment.

146
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:57,214
People can respect better where they stand once they have had these conversations.

147
00:10:58,195 --> 00:11:02,537
And they have been given achievable goals to be successful at their jobs.

148
00:11:03,794 --> 00:11:11,659
I have created training and development programs for better customer service skills that the employees can use as tools to mold their individual successes.

149
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:15,582
Let's face it, municipality is the ultimate customer service job.

150
00:11:16,883 --> 00:11:22,507
I take pride in putting the people first when performing a successful task, giving them the well-deserved credit.

151
00:11:23,848 --> 00:11:30,112
I'm not afraid to put myself out in front when we fail and take the responsibility when necessary for the people that work with me.

152
00:11:31,598 --> 00:11:37,672
I have accomplished much in my life and I'm excited for the opportunity to share what I've learned in my own community.

153
00:11:38,843 --> 00:11:42,385
I've been recognized and awarded many times over my business achievements.

154
00:11:42,825 --> 00:11:47,367
I was nominated businessman of the year in my community that I own my business in right now.

155
00:11:48,247 --> 00:11:51,489
I have been vice president and president of the Chamber of Commerce in Salem.

156
00:11:52,069 --> 00:12:01,353
I have worked with a company called Nelson Nygaard, which happens to be the exact same company that worked with Medford in 2005 to create their parking program.

157
00:12:02,113 --> 00:12:07,536
I worked with them for two and a half years to create the parking program in Salem that currently exists today.

158
00:12:08,716 --> 00:12:14,799
I have worked closely with many community groups and have been part of many initiatives to move a city forward and get business going.

159
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:25,605
I've worked closely with several community support groups, like Lifebridge, NAGLI, HAWK, and YMCA, just to speak of a few groups important to me.

160
00:12:26,925 --> 00:12:39,496
Having been taught time and time again in every situation that communication can solve mostly every problem, but you need to know when to listen and to learn and when to act on a situation.

161
00:12:41,517 --> 00:12:46,342
I take great pride in the fact that I'm approachable and my door is open to everyone.

162
00:12:47,483 --> 00:12:52,447
I have always said I cannot fix a problem that I do not know about, so let's talk.

163
00:12:54,262 --> 00:13:02,666
These are the most important issues frustrating citizens that I have met over the past few months, actually several months now, with a lot of walking and two pairs of shoes so far.

164
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:04,326
Parking.

165
00:13:05,667 --> 00:13:07,127
Let's hold Republic to the fire.

166
00:13:07,688 --> 00:13:10,789
This is the third party company that takes care of our parking program.

167
00:13:11,409 --> 00:13:22,754
And let's eliminate these kiosks once and for all on the streets or discuss a way to eliminate the current contract and create our own in-house program putting Medford citizens to work.

168
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:31,350
Look at a better way to create access to the local businesses that thrive on the in and out business by changing times and signs.

169
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:34,673
Give them the opportunity to take advantage of their type of business.

170
00:13:35,835 --> 00:13:39,959
Infrastructure issues like tree stumps, sidewalks, streets, and of course crosswalks.

171
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:41,960
Complete streets is not enough.

172
00:13:42,161 --> 00:13:44,023
People say they're not afraid to pay taxes.

173
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:46,024
They just want results.

174
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,881
In this area, I feel the administration is not doing well.

175
00:13:50,701 --> 00:13:57,983
We need to take a portion of the general fund money that is not part of the Complete Streets Project and get certain emergency situations done.

176
00:13:59,303 --> 00:14:05,325
Then we need to set aside annual funds to stay ahead by adding to the Complete Streets Project.

177
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:12,647
To pay for this, we need to create a preventative maintenance line item in the budget and expand on our DPW workforce.

178
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:21,534
This only makes common sense because you cannot expand a city while shrinking the very department responsible for the work that needs to be done.

179
00:14:24,696 --> 00:14:29,618
If we do not take these steps, then we just end up with an incomplete streets program.

180
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:32,320
It's time to have a clean and inviting city.

181
00:14:33,457 --> 00:14:35,999
the police, fire station, and safety.

182
00:14:36,019 --> 00:14:40,904
The current mayor committed two years ago to getting the process going in a new facility.

183
00:14:41,404 --> 00:14:52,535
Instead, the mayor put her efforts in a new library that will cost a total of close to $34 million, with $22 million of it going right to the bottom line for the citizens of Medford.

184
00:14:54,765 --> 00:15:07,660
I will have the necessary personnel involved in any conversation regarding the building of a fire and police station to discuss how and where we can count on receiving the money necessary to build the much needed facility before we start the planning.

185
00:15:08,521 --> 00:15:12,125
Hire the grant writer needed for the city so we can start planning on this project.

186
00:15:12,975 --> 00:15:25,468
I will also create a line item for hiring much needed staff that conforms to the projected growth of the city and the amount of fire and police needed to ensure the correct safety for both the citizens and our first responders.

187
00:15:26,388 --> 00:15:32,615
I would also like to revisit another promise not yet completed by the current administration.

188
00:15:33,075 --> 00:15:35,636
Mayor Burke talked about two years ago was foot patrols.

189
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:43,501
I think that's a great idea, and I think it's time we take a look at that, especially with the issues that we have, including the opioid situation.

190
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,702
We need to have foot patrols in our neighborhoods.

191
00:15:46,913 --> 00:15:52,996
And we can pay for this by increasing our increasing tax base by our new construction, so this can happen.

192
00:15:53,997 --> 00:15:58,460
Communication, the lack of good communication between the administration and the city council.

193
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:09,226
The mayor has stated in her most recent article that she created a council liaison for them to go to if they were having issues with the department head, but it was never their role to go to the city council meetings.

194
00:16:09,826 --> 00:16:16,050
Even though Mayor Burke did commit to being at or represented at the city council meetings, neither has happened.

195
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:20,453
I will be at the city council meetings once a month or as requested.

196
00:16:21,334 --> 00:16:42,553
I have the rapport with the city councilors and will continue to foster a better working relationship as well as create workshops with the city councilors, department heads and the administration as well as citizens of Medford in a casual environment to allow for frank, open and creative discussion on ways to move this city forward.

197
00:16:44,082 --> 00:16:54,385
I promise to make sure that I treat the city council as one body for the good of the city, and I vow to eliminate the day-to-day issues that they're faced with, which are not even their responsibility.

198
00:16:54,685 --> 00:16:58,026
For example, hours of conversation about potholes and sidewalks.

199
00:16:58,646 --> 00:17:04,888
We need to move the city forward, and these are not the conversations that the people who are supposed to move the city forward should be having.

200
00:17:05,973 --> 00:17:08,175
That is the DPW's responsibility.

201
00:17:08,575 --> 00:17:14,280
This will allow the council to put forth resolutions that will indeed move the city into the future.

202
00:17:16,082 --> 00:17:16,942
The downtowns.

203
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,625
This is the one that's near and dear to my heart as a business owner.

204
00:17:21,526 --> 00:17:27,912
Although the master plan is and has been a good start for many, many, many years, it is still not enough.

205
00:17:28,112 --> 00:17:30,514
We need to address the Office of Community Development.

206
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:38,449
and overall infrastructure of the administration to better prepare for anticipated growth spurt, this city will incur.

207
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:44,778
We need to seek out new and inventive small businesses to create excitement in our downtown.

208
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:49,264
For example, a dessert bar, a rooftop restaurant,

209
00:17:50,368 --> 00:18:01,520
an imported cheese shop, a local artist shop where you can actually take a class and display and or sell your art in that very shop, and many other varying shops that represent different cultures.

210
00:18:02,421 --> 00:18:08,588
This takes an outreach program that may span the globe using today's technology to travel through different shops.

211
00:18:09,609 --> 00:18:17,398
I want to create an office of design and review board that will help better balance the types of businesses in each and every downtown area.

212
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:21,082
Understanding the different personalities of each downtown.

213
00:18:23,164 --> 00:18:28,310
And especially the demographics of what would most of the people that would most likely shop these areas.

214
00:18:29,869 --> 00:18:30,709
The school system.

215
00:18:31,509 --> 00:18:32,469
Let's set goals.

216
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:38,150
Let's set a goal to get Medford's school system into the top 50, at least in the state.

217
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:46,892
I believe we can do much better and there is no shame, no shame, in borrowing really good ideas from surrounding school systems.

218
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:57,894
In fact, I'd like to create an outreach program with other more successful school administrations to foster a community of spirit shared by several areas that surround Medford.

219
00:18:58,843 --> 00:19:05,928
Then we can find ourselves in a healthy competition with surrounding cities in ranking and funding to better our standards.

220
00:19:07,149 --> 00:19:07,910
Charter review.

221
00:19:08,931 --> 00:19:24,042
It is time finally to look at our charter review if for no other reason than to continuously foster new ideas and ways to keep this city fluid and never to return to it's just the way we've always done it attitudes.

222
00:19:25,353 --> 00:19:26,354
opioid crisis.

223
00:19:27,014 --> 00:19:28,895
Hiring a recovery coach is good.

224
00:19:29,395 --> 00:19:30,956
In fact, I know Paul Spencer.

225
00:19:31,597 --> 00:19:36,820
I have known Paul since he was very young and coaching basketball at St.

226
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:37,860
Francis with my kids.

227
00:19:39,461 --> 00:19:40,842
We're all very proud of Paul.

228
00:19:41,042 --> 00:19:43,563
He's done such a great job in his life, and that's not easy.

229
00:19:44,064 --> 00:19:45,444
But that doesn't go far enough.

230
00:19:46,065 --> 00:19:51,048
We need to recruit leaders from all facets of our community and create an opioid commission.

231
00:19:51,857 --> 00:20:06,278
inclusive of police, fire, education, medical, psychological, religious, and civic leaders along with the administration to meet on a weekly or bi-weekly basis to tackle this on all fronts in our community.

232
00:20:07,896 --> 00:20:12,079
These are some of the problems that we're faced with on a day-to-day basis in Medford.

233
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:16,242
And these are some of the ways that I feel we can solve some of those problems.

234
00:20:16,803 --> 00:20:18,824
But there are so many topics to discuss.

235
00:20:19,525 --> 00:20:22,807
I would entertain any conversation to discuss those topics.

236
00:20:23,327 --> 00:20:27,090
But time not permitting, they will have to wait for you to reach out.

237
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:29,852
Give me an email at mckilloppermayer2017 at gmail.com.

238
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:38,556
or meet me at two of my favorite stomping grounds, Dunkin' Donuts or Da Metz.

239
00:20:39,816 --> 00:20:47,118
So if you've heard all about us tonight, but it really isn't about us, it's about you and what you want from Medford.

240
00:20:47,998 --> 00:20:54,080
Remember, everyone who's lobbying for your vote will, if elected, work for you.

241
00:20:55,178 --> 00:20:56,259
Some may forget that.

242
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,722
I will never forget that.

243
00:20:59,483 --> 00:21:01,505
These are the reasons why I've decided to run.

244
00:21:02,005 --> 00:21:08,933
I'm excited for the opportunity to debate these issues and more with the current mayor, Stephanie Burke, and we will, on November 2nd, do that.

245
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:14,759
Then hopefully you'll be informed enough to make the right decision, the one that will mold the future for this city.

246
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:19,301
My name is David McKillop, and I need your vote on November 7th.

247
00:21:19,702 --> 00:21:24,183
It's time to put Medford back on the tracks to growth, results, and prosperity.

248
00:21:24,724 --> 00:21:25,924
Thank you for coming out, folks.

249
00:21:26,104 --> 00:21:27,024
I really appreciate it.

250
00:21:27,325 --> 00:21:27,945
Have a great night.

251
00:21:27,985 --> 00:21:28,305
Thank you.

252
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:47,655
Yes.

253
00:21:47,695 --> 00:21:48,396
Can you hear me?

254
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:18,708
Can you hear me?

255
00:22:19,309 --> 00:22:19,729
Much better.

256
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:26,434
Thank you, Ward 6 and the Democratic Ward and City Committee, Griffin, for being here tonight.

257
00:22:26,474 --> 00:22:30,937
Thank you so much for offering us this forum in order to speak to you and the general public.

258
00:22:31,498 --> 00:22:36,361
My name is Stephanie Muccini-Burke, and I'm a candidate for re-election for the Office of Mayor for the City of Medford.

259
00:22:37,262 --> 00:22:43,184
I'm the proud daughter of Lee, who's in our audience, and my dad, George, and we grew up on First Street in Wellington.

260
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,325
My husband, Brian, and I have three beautiful children.

261
00:22:46,825 --> 00:22:51,667
We've been married 31 years, and all of our kids attended public schools and went on to college.

262
00:22:52,547 --> 00:22:58,589
Medford has been a wonderful place to raise our family, and it's why we choose to stay here each and every day.

263
00:22:59,030 --> 00:22:59,610
It is our home.

264
00:23:00,762 --> 00:23:04,364
After graduating from Medford High School, I attended Suffolk University.

265
00:23:05,044 --> 00:23:08,046
I commuted there every day and worked two jobs in order to put myself through.

266
00:23:08,706 --> 00:23:14,530
Those years were filled with learning, and the greatest lesson was that there is no substitution for hard work.

267
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:19,512
At Suffolk, I received a Bachelor of Science in Business with a major in Accounting.

268
00:23:20,373 --> 00:23:23,575
After graduating, I was hired at a Big 8 accounting firm.

269
00:23:23,615 --> 00:23:25,536
It was then that I earned my CPA license.

270
00:23:26,693 --> 00:23:31,298
I then went on to Bentley University evenings while working and obtained my master's in taxation.

271
00:23:32,239 --> 00:23:38,466
When Brian and I began our family, I changed career paths and I started my own business right in Medford Square on Forest Street.

272
00:23:38,986 --> 00:23:47,355
It was called Rycon Financial, named after my two boys at the time, and did I know I was going to have a little girl, I probably would have changed the name, but I didn't at that point.

273
00:23:48,556 --> 00:23:53,839
And I learned especially what goes on in Medford Square at that time after spending 10 years on Forest Street.

274
00:23:54,560 --> 00:24:00,083
It was while self-employed that I felt I had a need that I had to get involved with the City Council.

275
00:24:00,704 --> 00:24:02,245
I participated in local government.

276
00:24:02,265 --> 00:24:03,445
I thought it was very important.

277
00:24:04,106 --> 00:24:08,649
And the people of Medford honored me by electing me to serve 15 long years.

278
00:24:09,209 --> 00:24:11,650
And we worked really, really hard during those 15 years.

279
00:24:12,631 --> 00:24:17,334
This was followed by five years as the Director of Personnel and Budget for the City of Medford under Mayor McGlynn.

280
00:24:18,496 --> 00:24:24,562
And then in 2015, I was elected by the people to be Medford's mayor, one of the proudest days of my life.

281
00:24:26,323 --> 00:24:29,967
Anyone visiting our city these days would quickly know that it is an election year.

282
00:24:30,687 --> 00:24:31,728
You know what that means.

283
00:24:32,389 --> 00:24:36,873
Candidates using buzzwords and slogans, asking for support of you, the voter.

284
00:24:38,074 --> 00:24:42,658
We hear it from this one, vote for me and I'll do this, or vote for me and I'll do that.

285
00:24:43,667 --> 00:24:50,177
So I am sure that you will not mind if I spare you the slogans and buzzwords because you deserve more than that.

286
00:24:51,079 --> 00:24:56,728
You deserve a clear description of my accomplishments as mayor and my hopes for the next two years.

287
00:24:59,222 --> 00:25:02,003
After all, each of you wants the same thing that I want.

288
00:25:02,463 --> 00:25:05,244
We want a Medford that can be the greatest it can be.

289
00:25:06,085 --> 00:25:09,286
So when I say to you that I will be accountable, it's not a slogan.

290
00:25:10,226 --> 00:25:13,928
It is my acknowledgment that the work of government is never done alone.

291
00:25:13,948 --> 00:25:16,429
It is never the work of one person.

292
00:25:17,189 --> 00:25:23,632
We live in a democracy and we work in collaboration with each other, and that is why I call each of you a partner in progress.

293
00:25:25,726 --> 00:25:28,007
As I stated, I'm a certified public accountant.

294
00:25:28,167 --> 00:25:32,950
My professional experience has brought me a deep understanding of the value of managing assets.

295
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,751
It is second nature to me.

296
00:25:35,331 --> 00:25:45,237
And simply put, a well-managed city is one where the resources and assets of the city are identified, needs are assessed, and needs are fulfilled.

297
00:25:46,118 --> 00:25:48,279
As we all know, this requires funding.

298
00:25:50,245 --> 00:25:56,327
My administration has and will continue to be a responsible steward of our taxpayers' hard-earned dollars.

299
00:25:56,947 --> 00:26:00,948
We will continue to aggressively pursue grant funding to leverage our dollars.

300
00:26:01,988 --> 00:26:04,489
Medford's high quality bond rating is no accident.

301
00:26:04,929 --> 00:26:10,911
It's the result of careful planning and a prudent expenditure of municipal funds to projects that better our city.

302
00:26:11,671 --> 00:26:16,112
Just today, we were listed as a top 10 list of most successful cities by Zipia.

303
00:26:16,973 --> 00:26:17,853
We're quite proud of that.

304
00:26:18,793 --> 00:26:28,975
My administration has also been accountable where the rubber meets the road, literally through the Complete Streets Initiative, which we brought into the city of Medford within three months of me being sworn into office.

305
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:37,617
We have moved forward to repave and fix major roads throughout every section of the city, which will make it safer for pedestrians, bicyclists, and vehicles.

306
00:26:38,417 --> 00:26:42,598
Our infrastructure needs are continually being addressed through the efforts of our Department of Public Works.

307
00:26:44,448 --> 00:26:48,850
I am proud of tackling the issues of the need of a new police station head-on.

308
00:26:49,611 --> 00:26:53,232
For years, the rundown condition of the police department headquarters has been known.

309
00:26:53,933 --> 00:26:56,874
For years, this one condition was not adequately addressed.

310
00:26:57,515 --> 00:27:01,337
But I did not choose to look in the rearview mirror and ask why.

311
00:27:01,857 --> 00:27:03,458
Rather, I have chosen to look forward.

312
00:27:04,158 --> 00:27:08,160
Because the starting point of all success is action, not blame.

313
00:27:08,901 --> 00:27:12,983
So my administration initiated the process to build a new state-of-the-art police station.

314
00:27:13,363 --> 00:27:15,884
We've been meeting weekly now for over three months.

315
00:27:16,424 --> 00:27:24,649
It's a team that's comprised of our police chief, our city engineer, our environmentalist, as well as members of the police squad from all levels.

316
00:27:25,129 --> 00:27:32,037
men, female, that have been visiting police stations around our state and around our area to find out what's the best and what's the worst.

317
00:27:32,157 --> 00:27:32,777
What do we like?

318
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:41,987
What do we want our station to have so that we do it right once, not have to go back and make changes two years down the road because it's the police headquarters that simply doesn't work.

319
00:27:43,098 --> 00:27:50,764
Our fine law enforcement personnel deserve nothing less, as they serve the safety needs of our residents every hour of every day of every night.

320
00:27:51,765 --> 00:27:54,567
In the world in which we live, safety can never be taken for granted.

321
00:27:54,588 --> 00:27:59,832
The needs of our public safety employees are many, and they must continually be addressed.

322
00:28:01,192 --> 00:28:02,152
We have done just that.

323
00:28:02,172 --> 00:28:14,297
In year one of our five-year capital plan, the city has purchased 12 new police cruisers, breathing apparatus and turnout gear for our firefighters, new trucks and equipment for our DPW employees.

324
00:28:15,818 --> 00:28:19,319
However, public safety and public health is more than new equipment.

325
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:25,442
It is the converging of all departments and levels of government to come together to fight an epidemic.

326
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:28,632
Of course, I'm speaking of the opioid crisis.

327
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:36,097
Every Medford family stands shoulder to shoulder with each other in the fight against this reality.

328
00:28:36,917 --> 00:28:39,679
When one of our families suffers, we all suffer.

329
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:47,405
So to assist in this fight and augment the public services already in place, I did hire a full-time recovery coach.

330
00:28:48,125 --> 00:28:54,751
For the first time, there's someone who has a specific purpose to work within our community, along with various agencies.

331
00:28:55,271 --> 00:29:11,866
Marion Ryan, our district attorney, has monthly forums up at the Lawrence Memorial Hospital, where she brings together public health officials, City of Medford employees, police, fire from a multitude of communities to talk about this issue and to determine best practices.

332
00:29:12,127 --> 00:29:13,508
This is already being done today.

333
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:21,371
This is a disease that is so decimating to so many, especially our young people.

334
00:29:23,412 --> 00:29:29,954
Sometimes the quality of life in our city can oftentimes be measured by the spaces that we gather as a community.

335
00:29:30,774 --> 00:29:32,574
This truth has not been lost on me.

336
00:29:33,234 --> 00:29:36,955
It started with the rehabilitation of this beautiful building that we gather in today.

337
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:45,678
Celebrating its 80th birthday, I might tell you, WPA project, and we're very proud, and there's a birthday party next Thursday evening, so come on down.

338
00:29:46,638 --> 00:29:52,586
Also, we've been partnering with the Metropolitan Area Planning Council and with the input of residents and business owners.

339
00:29:53,107 --> 00:29:57,312
We've engaged in a collaborative effort to plan for the revitalization of Medford Square.

340
00:29:58,093 --> 00:29:59,876
This plan will not be put on a shelf.

341
00:30:00,036 --> 00:30:01,678
This plan will be implemented.

342
00:30:01,698 --> 00:30:02,639
I guarantee it.

343
00:30:03,435 --> 00:30:17,612
And this has resulted in a goal of a mixed-use zone to live, work, and play, a plan for bicycle accessibility, safer streetscapes, connectivity of our pathways, and refocusing on our jewel, the mighty Mystic River.

344
00:30:18,882 --> 00:30:21,683
In addition, work has begun on the Riverside Plaza project.

345
00:30:22,323 --> 00:30:31,987
This is an effort to transform a portion of Medford Square into a multi-use space to allow residents to engage in passive recreation or simply enjoy a community event.

346
00:30:32,567 --> 00:30:35,548
Sense of community and quality of life go hand in hand.

347
00:30:35,928 --> 00:30:38,489
We need these community spaces in order to do that.

348
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:43,911
Investment in a city also means to put its resources to their optimal use.

349
00:30:44,512 --> 00:30:47,553
We have done just that with the hidden gem, the Chevalier Theater.

350
00:30:48,623 --> 00:31:00,928
By hiring a professional management company, Bill Blumenreich presents of the Wilbur Theater, to promote the Chevalier and to serve not only as a catalyst for arts and culture, but also as well as economic development in our Medford Square.

351
00:31:01,828 --> 00:31:12,072
This long overdue effort will create jobs, opportunities for our current and future small businesses, and provide an exciting new venue for first class entertainment in Medford.

352
00:31:13,351 --> 00:31:21,578
It is my hope that these efforts will not simply transform brick and mortar, but have an impact on the enjoyment of life for all of the residents of this city.

353
00:31:23,059 --> 00:31:26,782
I am equally proud to shape the creation of a new full-time recreation department.

354
00:31:27,463 --> 00:31:36,631
This need has gone unaddressed in our community, and now we will have a department that will serve the recreational needs of Medford residents of all ages, young to old.

355
00:31:37,898 --> 00:31:42,360
And when I hear the people say that our students are our future, I say that is an understatement.

356
00:31:42,981 --> 00:31:47,203
I say that they are our potential and that we need to serve that potential now.

357
00:31:48,143 --> 00:31:54,727
I am most proud of the work undertaken in support, supporting our expanded educational opportunities in our public schools.

358
00:31:55,660 --> 00:32:14,966
Example of these new programs at Medford High include environmental studies, engineering, robotics, and a host of AP classes, a new media center that we're having a get together on this coming Sunday, as well as a brand new culinary arts restaurant, Bistro 489, that will be opening in November.

359
00:32:15,766 --> 00:32:23,989
With these uplifting programs, our talented teachers, and most importantly, supportive parents, Medford's future has never looked brighter.

360
00:32:25,582 --> 00:32:45,659
Each of these efforts is aimed at one goal, to make our city a vibrant community where everyone, young to senior, in the richness of our diversity, can fulfill their definition of neighborhood, their hopes for their children and family, in a safe, fully inclusive, participatory, and democratic fashion.

361
00:32:46,179 --> 00:32:47,881
We are a welcoming city.

362
00:32:49,802 --> 00:32:52,064
Being mayor is more than offering a slogan or a buzzword.

363
00:32:52,664 --> 00:32:56,026
It's living up to the promise to serve every single day.

364
00:32:56,867 --> 00:33:04,872
Whether it be arts and culture, constituent service, or spending time with your children at school, I more than enjoy serving Medford as its mayor.

365
00:33:05,913 --> 00:33:19,282
It's a hard job, but one that I love, because every day brings new opportunity to work in collaboration with the fine people of our city, young to senior again, to implement the Medford of tomorrow.

366
00:33:20,805 --> 00:33:26,469
My education, experience, knowledge of government, and deep commitment to this city is demonstrated daily.

367
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:31,774
I am very proud of our first term accomplishments, but there is more work to be done.

368
00:33:32,714 --> 00:33:36,197
Please allow me the opportunity and the honor of serving you as your mayor.

369
00:33:36,737 --> 00:33:38,579
I humbly request that you vote for me.

370
00:33:39,079 --> 00:33:42,182
Cast your vote on November 7th for Stephanie Muccini-Burke.

371
00:33:42,682 --> 00:33:45,024
Please, let's continue to be partners in progress.

372
00:33:45,384 --> 00:33:46,245
Thank you and God bless.

373
00:34:02,631 --> 00:34:09,160
Actually, now we have to thank both candidates, you know, David and Mayor Stephanie for

374
00:34:10,198 --> 00:34:11,899
you know, meeting with the audience.

375
00:34:12,499 --> 00:34:15,321
And now, remember, we're going to be folding this one.

376
00:34:15,601 --> 00:34:16,822
We're going to be folding this one.

377
00:34:16,882 --> 00:34:19,924
We have the school committee that will follow this one.

378
00:34:20,384 --> 00:34:22,885
One thing for sure, don't forget to vote in November 7.

379
00:34:23,886 --> 00:34:27,588
And I believe the last day for registration is October 18.

380
00:34:28,629 --> 00:34:29,689
So you got to remember that.

381
00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:34,852
That's our job to remind you and your job to write it down on your set, November 7.

382
00:34:35,413 --> 00:34:35,993
I thank you.

383
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:37,434
for your presence.

384
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:37,754
Ms.

385
00:34:37,774 --> 00:34:38,675
Stephanie, thank you.

386
00:34:38,735 --> 00:34:39,055
Thank you.

387
00:34:39,075 --> 00:34:40,996
Mr. McElough, thank you.

388
00:34:41,016 --> 00:34:42,337
All right, good luck.

389
00:34:42,357 --> 00:34:43,438
See you back here at 8 o'clock.

390
00:34:47,281 --> 00:34:49,662
Welcome to the 2017 Candidate Night

391
00:35:04,562 --> 00:35:08,785
for people running for school committee.

392
00:35:09,826 --> 00:35:18,752
Representative Paul Donato, who will chair the Medford Democratic City White, will give you the welcome.

393
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:34,998
Once again, good evening, and my name is Paul Donato, and I am the chair of the Democratic Ward and City Committee, along with my co-chair, Nancy Denise White.

394
00:35:35,699 --> 00:35:39,962
And we welcome, once again, all of you to now the school committee forum.

395
00:35:40,582 --> 00:35:53,913
And the chair and the co-chair and the members of the Ward and City Committee would like to thank the Ward 6 chair, Henry Milleran, and his committee for putting on this forum.

396
00:35:54,428 --> 00:36:08,331
Because this will be the forum that the citizens of Medford have the opportunity to listen to now the school committee candidates who will have some time to talk to you and tell you what their thoughts, opinions, and ideas are for the upcoming year.

397
00:36:08,951 --> 00:36:14,992
So once again, I want to thank you and now introduce you to Julia, who will lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance.

398
00:36:15,913 --> 00:36:16,453
Please stand.

399
00:36:16,473 --> 00:36:17,253
Please stand.

400
00:36:20,458 --> 00:36:33,269
pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

401
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:34,010
Thank you.

402
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:34,571
Thank you.

403
00:36:40,716 --> 00:36:42,277
Again, like we said, welcome.

404
00:36:42,618 --> 00:36:43,118
You heard it.

405
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:47,362
The vote that we cast as citizens are important.

406
00:36:48,303 --> 00:37:00,146
In most cases, we leave after casting our vote for two years municipal election, four years presidential, and six years to come.

407
00:37:01,447 --> 00:37:11,410
The decision to vote always have an impact on our lives, on our lives and the lives of our neighbors, our children, our friends.

408
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:15,951
It has an impact on our health and the safety of our community.

409
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:32,587
have an impact on education and schools because the folks we're holding here today are candidates for school committee members and possibly our own individual.

410
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:47,132
We would have hoped to do a Q&A, but we did not receive enough questions from the city.

411
00:37:47,192 --> 00:37:51,074
So in lieu of a question and answer session, we invited each candidate to prepare a statement.

412
00:37:51,494 --> 00:37:55,896
We gave a list of issues to each to, you know, whatever they wanted to address within that.

413
00:37:56,642 --> 00:38:00,285
And they will each have five minutes to give their statement.

414
00:38:01,246 --> 00:38:03,608
The order in which they will speak was done by lottery.

415
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:06,391
So just randomly, they selected numbers from a hat.

416
00:38:07,151 --> 00:38:10,254
And we have two timekeepers.

417
00:38:10,915 --> 00:38:14,157
And so I think at 15 seconds, you'll get a little yellow flag warning.

418
00:38:14,177 --> 00:38:15,338
You want to show them what that looks like?

419
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:17,640
Can we demonstrate the yellow?

420
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,242
Actually, that's gold, but we call it.

421
00:38:19,613 --> 00:38:23,116
You know, it's like a green-red-yellow traffic.

422
00:38:23,156 --> 00:38:30,282
So you get the yellow warning at 15 seconds and the red when you've hit your five minutes, and Henry has the power to cut the mic.

423
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:33,744
So you have five minutes, and that's it.

424
00:38:33,764 --> 00:38:36,166
And so we'll ask that you go to the front and speak at that microphone.

425
00:38:36,907 --> 00:38:39,049
I think that was it.

426
00:38:39,069 --> 00:38:44,673
Basically, Julia will, as my co-moderator, will introduce each of you.

427
00:38:45,234 --> 00:38:48,937
Not a sequence, but she will say, you know,

428
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:50,710
I have the list of names.

429
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:52,211
Mr. Rodriguez, we will go by the name.

430
00:38:52,251 --> 00:38:54,191
When she said your name, you can stand up.

431
00:38:54,251 --> 00:38:57,292
When the time to speak, you know the order of drawing.

432
00:38:57,392 --> 00:38:58,252
We draw numbers.

433
00:38:58,712 --> 00:39:01,173
The sequence is one, two, three, up to nine.

434
00:39:01,573 --> 00:39:09,835
So when we get to the one missing candidate, we will read you a statement of that missing candidate and why she's not here with you.

435
00:39:10,155 --> 00:39:10,435
OK?

436
00:39:10,995 --> 00:39:15,736
So I have the list of names and the order in which they will appear on the ballot, which is not the order in which they're sitting.

437
00:39:15,776 --> 00:39:18,377
They're right now sitting in the speaking order that was chosen by lottery.

438
00:39:19,797 --> 00:39:22,619
I'm going to catch you by surprise who I call first in ballot order.

439
00:39:22,999 --> 00:39:25,861
So first, if when I just say your name, you can just stand up so the audience can see who you are.

440
00:39:25,961 --> 00:39:26,641
Paul Russo.

441
00:39:30,003 --> 00:39:31,884
Kathleen Creets.

442
00:39:35,447 --> 00:39:36,187
Michael Ruggiero.

443
00:39:39,569 --> 00:39:41,030
Maya Quinn Musone.

444
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:42,811
I didn't say Musone.

445
00:39:44,372 --> 00:39:45,092
Robert Skerry.

446
00:39:47,894 --> 00:39:48,895
Alexis Rodriguez.

447
00:39:51,828 --> 00:39:52,408
Angela Moore.

448
00:39:55,451 --> 00:39:56,471
Kathleen Cullinane.

449
00:39:56,491 --> 00:39:57,112
Did I say that right?

450
00:39:57,732 --> 00:39:58,032
Close.

451
00:39:58,233 --> 00:39:58,693
Cullinane.

452
00:39:59,413 --> 00:40:00,314
Erin DiBenedetto.

453
00:40:01,355 --> 00:40:01,715
Thank you.

454
00:40:04,137 --> 00:40:05,598
And so I'm just going to start really briefly.

455
00:40:05,618 --> 00:40:09,140
We have one more candidate, Paulette van der Kloot, who unfortunately is ill.

456
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:13,183
So I'm just going to read a very brief few sentence statements from her since she couldn't be here tonight.

457
00:40:13,871 --> 00:40:20,377
She simply said, I'm terribly sorry I cannot join you tonight, but I am recovering from an unexpected blip in my normally good health.

458
00:40:20,717 --> 00:40:21,678
Apologies to all.

459
00:40:22,238 --> 00:40:24,400
I will post a statement on social media next week.

460
00:40:24,921 --> 00:40:25,361
Thank you.

461
00:40:25,501 --> 00:40:29,585
And just so it does not go unsaid tonight, please give a hoot, Pauline van der Gloot.

462
00:40:31,086 --> 00:40:31,847
All right, give her.

463
00:40:31,967 --> 00:40:32,927
I think she'll be OK.

464
00:40:33,508 --> 00:40:37,852
To the audience, please hold all upload until we finish.

465
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:42,520
We have five minutes for each candidate times nine.

466
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:43,760
That's 45 minutes.

467
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,701
We're trying not to go over the nine o'clock deadline.

468
00:40:47,381 --> 00:40:51,522
So let's save it for the last, after the last one.

469
00:40:51,802 --> 00:40:57,803
I will ask you together to stand up and give them a round of applause, please.

470
00:40:58,383 --> 00:40:59,003
I would like that.

471
00:40:59,083 --> 00:40:59,443
Thank you.

472
00:41:02,024 --> 00:41:04,504
So we are, we did that already.

473
00:41:04,564 --> 00:41:05,584
We're good.

474
00:41:06,845 --> 00:41:08,565
First candidate from the lottery.

475
00:41:09,572 --> 00:41:12,635
First candidate, so number one, I believe that's Robert Skerry.

476
00:41:14,636 --> 00:41:18,180
Would you mind standing up and going to the, yeah, and you can get the microphone on.

477
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:18,440
Great.

478
00:41:22,503 --> 00:41:22,984
Good evening.

479
00:41:23,244 --> 00:41:29,609
My name is Robert Emmett Skerry, Jr., and I'm here tonight to humbly ask for one of your six votes to return to the Medford School Committee.

480
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:33,593
I put my years of experience to work for you and the children of Medford.

481
00:41:34,362 --> 00:41:43,567
Medford has vastly improved its standing among public schools in the area with modernized facilities to help our children and staff flourish in the best educational setting possible.

482
00:41:44,108 --> 00:41:49,010
The gravity of changes in the educational system in Medford require a strong and steady hand.

483
00:41:51,012 --> 00:41:59,036
My experience, drive, presence, and commitment to the Medford educational community enable me to achieve results no matter what the obstacles.

484
00:41:59,977 --> 00:42:02,018
I demand nothing less for our young people.

485
00:42:03,109 --> 00:42:18,732
I work tirelessly for keeping our class sizes small, consistently updating our curriculum, acquiring additional funding sources such as partnerships with the Bloomberg Foundation, Global Scholars, and National Foundation for Education.

486
00:42:19,332 --> 00:42:23,953
We've created new vocational programs and a robotic technology program.

487
00:42:25,134 --> 00:42:28,754
We've expanded counseling services in kindergarten through grade 12.

488
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:31,155
We continue to stress health,

489
00:42:31,763 --> 00:42:34,565
amongst our students in their wellness and well-being.

490
00:42:35,666 --> 00:42:38,568
We've always kept art and music programs alive in Medford.

491
00:42:39,249 --> 00:42:42,692
We've offered quality extracurricular activities and athletic programs.

492
00:42:43,252 --> 00:42:55,602
We continue preventative maintenance programs system-wide, and we've balanced the budget in tough fiscal times, and we have not sought additional funds from the city council in the last 10 years.

493
00:42:56,903 --> 00:42:59,745
I advocate to create a five-year master plan for our buildings.

494
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:02,712
set up a new maintenance initiative.

495
00:43:03,232 --> 00:43:16,764
Key parts of such a plan will include developing green spaces in our schools that will benefit everyone, and also possibly developing a greenhouse to supplement our technological and health programs at Medford High School.

496
00:43:17,885 --> 00:43:20,948
I'll advocate to review security plans on a timely basis.

497
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:26,173
Doing so will ensure that security monitors are always in operation,

498
00:43:26,752 --> 00:43:31,114
to foster the physical, emotional, and security of our students, faculty, and staff.

499
00:43:32,335 --> 00:43:35,116
Education is the cornerstone of a prosperous community.

500
00:43:35,856 --> 00:43:41,899
In Medford, I will place the highest priority of giving our young citizens every chance to achieve their dreams.

501
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:52,184
My school board experience through good times and bad times provide me with the perspective and skill to fix problems, overcome bureaucratic obstacles,

502
00:43:52,655 --> 00:43:56,976
and further the successes so that our students can achieve to be the best that they can be.

503
00:43:58,176 --> 00:44:06,478
An education attained in our schools permits our youngsters to compete socially, civically, and successfully in a global economy.

504
00:44:07,499 --> 00:44:12,260
The school budget is the foundation upon which successful educational outcomes are built.

505
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:20,842
Across the nation, financial failings are registered, but we in Medford are working hard to ensure that hard-earned tax dollars

506
00:44:21,539 --> 00:44:24,840
that you taxpayers pay the city are best spent on our children.

507
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:33,163
I scrutinize expenditures to assure school funds are used prudently on behalf of and benefit our students and our staff.

508
00:44:34,223 --> 00:44:41,725
I advocate and am the voice for proven programs that give Medford's children the ability to flourish and succeed in today's world.

509
00:44:42,665 --> 00:44:50,368
Programs enable graduates to compete for jobs, to complete advanced education, and continue lifelong learning after high school.

510
00:44:51,468 --> 00:44:56,830
I require new programs to substantiate their effectiveness before funding and implementation.

511
00:44:57,651 --> 00:45:05,294
I work tirelessly to increase public-private partnerships and expand community relations with other institutions of higher learning.

512
00:45:06,295 --> 00:45:16,359
I fight to advance educational strategies to support our students through schooling and to maximize the number of students who prepare, who are prepared at Medford High and go on to graduate.

513
00:45:17,099 --> 00:45:18,240
I never fear the challenge,

514
00:45:19,578 --> 00:45:28,364
to present to current administrators and school administration to provide remediation programs so that no willing student is left behind.

515
00:45:28,945 --> 00:45:42,895
If a child in his senior year has not passed his MCAS test, I want to go the extra yard to make sure that they have the opportunity to take the exam, complete their portfolio, and walk across the stage and get their diploma.

516
00:45:44,256 --> 00:45:47,979
As always, I bring concerns of parents and the students to the school committee table.

517
00:45:48,752 --> 00:45:51,255
Parental involvement is crucial to a child's life.

518
00:45:51,935 --> 00:45:57,641
I believe that parents and schools must work in unison to create the best educational environment possible.

519
00:45:58,682 --> 00:46:11,215
While parents have a nurturing and protective nature with respect to their children, they must understand that the goals and objectives of our professional educators should be embraced rather than undermined.

520
00:46:12,825 --> 00:46:20,308
As a member of the school committee, I never fear speaking my mind against frivolous spending and personnel appointments that are not in the best interest of our school community.

521
00:46:20,828 --> 00:46:26,410
I demand accountability from our school personnel and strongly promote the professional development of staff and personnel.

522
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:35,153
I have a few more pages, but once again, I humbly ask for your vote, your consideration, and I've been proud to be your school committeeman.

523
00:46:35,773 --> 00:46:37,474
Please remember Robert Emmett Skerry Jr.

524
00:46:37,534 --> 00:46:38,394
on November 7th.

525
00:46:38,934 --> 00:46:40,275
Thank you and God bless America.

526
00:46:48,017 --> 00:46:49,038
Alex Rodriguez.

527
00:46:57,125 --> 00:46:57,466
Good evening.

528
00:46:58,246 --> 00:47:01,449
My name is Alexis Rodriguez, and I am your candidate for Medford School Committee.

529
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:11,458
I was raised in a little Puerto Rican community in the south end of Boston when my parents moved here from Puerto Rico, and then we moved to Maverick in East Boston.

530
00:47:13,218 --> 00:47:21,224
I moved to Memphis some 15 years ago when I met my wife, Cheryl Rodriguez, who is your candidate for city council, and I've been living here ever since.

531
00:47:22,425 --> 00:47:23,606
We have two beautiful daughters.

532
00:47:24,187 --> 00:47:29,551
One is 21 years old, and she currently lives across the country, spreading her wings and following her dreams.

533
00:47:30,491 --> 00:47:40,820
And we have a nine-year-old who is currently in fourth grade at the Roberts Elementary School, and she's gonna get the same opportunities as her older sister when she turns 21.

534
00:47:45,739 --> 00:47:48,661
I have been a financial and operations auditor for over 10 years.

535
00:47:49,961 --> 00:47:58,766
I've worked in a very demanding and complicated world of healthcare for Massachusetts Medicaid, Athena Health, and I currently work for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts.

536
00:47:59,426 --> 00:48:04,309
I understand solutions that are complicated but equitable to various interested parties.

537
00:48:05,365 --> 00:48:16,690
As a parent that has been in the Medford Public Schools ecosystem for over 15 years, and currently in my fourth year as a board member of the Roberts Elementary School, I know how hard our educators work.

538
00:48:17,650 --> 00:48:29,475
I know firsthand that it is important to maintain an open line of communication where our educators and our parents can openly express their hardships with us that they are encountering when they navigate our education system.

539
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:36,964
As a kindergarten parent at the Roberts some five years ago, I saw a need for improving the lines of communication.

540
00:48:38,145 --> 00:48:43,648
I remember raising my hand at a PTO meeting and offered to fill the then-vacant role of president.

541
00:48:45,229 --> 00:48:50,153
I did not get that, but I have been the secretary of that PTO for the last four years.

542
00:48:52,954 --> 00:48:56,337
As a board member at the PTO, I worked to improve our lines of communication.

543
00:48:57,332 --> 00:48:59,413
I worked to create our online presence.

544
00:48:59,473 --> 00:49:00,293
I built a website.

545
00:49:00,874 --> 00:49:04,155
I built accounts on social media, on Facebook and Twitter.

546
00:49:05,516 --> 00:49:08,237
And that created more involvement from parents.

547
00:49:08,317 --> 00:49:21,503
And today, we have such great involvement from our parent community that we have the opportunity, through successful fundraisers, to give the school computers, which I don't think is public yet.

548
00:49:27,253 --> 00:49:27,874
I lost my place.

549
00:49:30,055 --> 00:49:36,961
I have worked collaboratively with the school in helping create new curriculum nights, like the annual art show.

550
00:49:37,702 --> 00:49:49,772
And as a field day coordinator, I work to stay within our budget and still provide every kid in the school a t-shirt and a water bottle that they can keep with them at the end of the year to remember the Roberts Elementary School.

551
00:49:51,193 --> 00:49:54,456
It has been a great experience making an impact and giving back to our school.

552
00:49:56,062 --> 00:50:04,646
Our school committee should work with our educators to be the hub of information for the community at large.

553
00:50:05,166 --> 00:50:07,827
We can work towards simplifying the lines of communication.

554
00:50:08,788 --> 00:50:18,012
As a school committee member, I propose that each of us adopt a school and be that one school's go-to person, that instead of having a committee of people to go to,

555
00:50:18,623 --> 00:50:21,686
that they would have one person to go to that they can speak to openly.

556
00:50:22,586 --> 00:50:24,908
And that person can rotate regularly.

557
00:50:25,329 --> 00:50:27,310
It doesn't have to be the same person all the time.

558
00:50:27,731 --> 00:50:38,179
And this would give not only every committee member the opportunity to gain the pulse of every school, but it would also give every school the opportunity to get to know every committee member.

559
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:44,625
And I think that is very important when navigating the complexities of our very diverse communities.

560
00:50:48,090 --> 00:50:59,993
So when elected, I will work towards opening up those lines of communications and building that awareness and creating a social media presence with our parents, staff, and administrators of this great community.

561
00:51:00,633 --> 00:51:01,913
And I thank you for watching.

562
00:51:02,654 --> 00:51:05,594
And vote for me, Alexis Rodriguez, for school committee on November 7.

563
00:51:09,195 --> 00:51:10,015
Thank you, Alex.

564
00:51:12,916 --> 00:51:13,296
Mia.

565
00:51:15,437 --> 00:51:15,617
Mia.

566
00:51:21,632 --> 00:51:25,296
I was just going to thank Rep Tonato because I was nervous and he serenaded me.

567
00:51:25,376 --> 00:51:26,437
You can call me sweetheart.

568
00:51:26,497 --> 00:51:28,279
So I feel a little better now, but he's gone.

569
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:30,161
Um, good evening.

570
00:51:30,201 --> 00:51:33,925
My name is Mia Quinn, my stone, and I'd like to thank you all for being here.

571
00:51:34,185 --> 00:51:36,988
I am running for reelection of the Medford school committee.

572
00:51:37,629 --> 00:51:40,312
My husband, Tim and I are the parents of six children.

573
00:51:41,088 --> 00:51:48,354
Quinns 15, this gets tiresome, Teagan 12, Cullen 11, Nevin 9, Rowan 8, and Declan 5.

574
00:51:48,875 --> 00:51:53,138
Two of my children attend the Andrews Middle School and three attend the Roberts Elementary School.

575
00:51:54,059 --> 00:51:58,663
I proudly and humbly ask for your vote in my re-election bid for the Medford School Committee.

576
00:51:59,423 --> 00:52:02,666
For the past 20 months, I have been serving as a school committee member.

577
00:52:03,227 --> 00:52:07,050
While many of our goals have been achieved, there are still many to work on.

578
00:52:07,805 --> 00:52:18,769
We addressed issues relevant to most parents, school bus transportation, large class sizes, special education, student safety, student enrichment, and building and grounds maintenance.

579
00:52:19,709 --> 00:52:28,812
As a school committee member, I have learned to work well with the mayor, my fellow school committee members, and the chief of police to accomplish some concrete improvements.

580
00:52:29,432 --> 00:52:32,173
I helped to address the overcrowding on some of our school buses.

581
00:52:32,753 --> 00:52:37,475
In regards to class size, we have maintained and supported small classroom sizes throughout the district.

582
00:52:38,979 --> 00:52:47,665
As a committee member, I have had the opportunity to work closely with the Special Education Parent Advisory Committee, addressing and ensuring all students' needs are achieved.

583
00:52:48,525 --> 00:52:52,908
Our student enrichment has been enhanced as well with the hiring of two additional music teachers.

584
00:52:53,709 --> 00:53:01,014
A concern that was brought to my attention as a new committee member was the need to address the maintenance and beautification of Medford High School.

585
00:53:01,714 --> 00:53:06,918
With the mayor's support, aesthetic improvements are happening at the high school and more improvements are in the works.

586
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:14,526
If reelected, I would like to implement a master facilities plan addressing the upkeep and care of all our school buildings.

587
00:53:15,307 --> 00:53:21,050
Please reach out to me if you have suggestions on how we can improve the physical space of the high school or the other school buildings.

588
00:53:22,497 --> 00:53:30,061
At this same type of forum two years ago when I first ran, I said throughout my candidate statement, I will ask for you.

589
00:53:30,621 --> 00:53:31,622
That was my tagline.

590
00:53:31,922 --> 00:53:32,622
I will ask for you.

591
00:53:33,323 --> 00:53:37,405
And as I reflect on the last 20 months, I believe I have asked for you.

592
00:53:38,065 --> 00:53:42,868
Whether it was an IEP concern, an athletic question, a safety recommendation,

593
00:53:43,422 --> 00:53:48,325
a curriculum inquiry, I have asked the appropriate Medford Public Schools staff member.

594
00:53:49,025 --> 00:53:53,888
And while the answer wasn't always what we had hoped for, I lobbied and petitioned for the parents.

595
00:53:54,389 --> 00:53:57,871
And I'm hoping that you continue to give me that opportunity to ask for you.

596
00:53:58,771 --> 00:54:06,716
Without question, I am invested in our schools and committed to ensuring that every child receives a caring, safe, and challenging educational experience.

597
00:54:07,375 --> 00:54:08,876
that will prepare them for the future.

598
00:54:09,577 --> 00:54:19,506
I encourage you to get in touch with me via email, Mia, M-E-A, I'm the Irish Mia, Mary Elizabeth Ann, Mustone at yahoo.com, Facebook, Mia Quinn Mustone.

599
00:54:20,006 --> 00:54:23,690
My home phone is 781-391-5909.

600
00:54:24,530 --> 00:54:26,332
And I ask for your vote on November 7th.

601
00:54:26,512 --> 00:54:27,073
Thanks so much.

602
00:54:28,194 --> 00:54:28,894
Thank you, Mia.

603
00:54:31,276 --> 00:54:31,937
Angela Moore.

604
00:54:40,115 --> 00:54:41,055
Hi, Medford residents.

605
00:54:41,876 --> 00:54:46,417
My name is Angela Monsell-Moore, and I'm a candidate for one of the six school committee seats.

606
00:54:47,118 --> 00:54:54,100
By way of introduction, my family moved to Medford from Ireland when I was six, and I started in Medford Public Schools.

607
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:57,121
I graduated from Medford High in 1994.

608
00:54:57,822 --> 00:55:06,745
I have a degree in biochemistry and religious studies, as well as radiological sciences, x-ray technology, and I'm a certified kickboxing and Muay Thai instructor.

609
00:55:07,777 --> 00:55:11,379
My husband and I decided to stay in Medford and raise our four children here.

610
00:55:12,459 --> 00:55:14,620
My twins are in their second year of college.

611
00:55:15,541 --> 00:55:19,783
I have a son that is a sixth grader at the Andrews and a daughter that is a fourth grader at the Roberts.

612
00:55:20,563 --> 00:55:30,188
As a graduate of Medford Public Schools and now a parent of students in the schools, I have a unique perspective on what seems to work well within our schools and what could be improved upon.

613
00:55:31,589 --> 00:55:36,071
Knowing children in Medford that attend schools at each level, from elementary through high school,

614
00:55:36,737 --> 00:55:46,123
as well as interacting with parents at all levels, has allowed me an opportunity to gain insights into the strengths of our schools, as well as the concerns of parents and students.

615
00:55:47,484 --> 00:55:51,587
Throughout this campaign, many people have asked me why am I running for school committee.

616
00:55:52,448 --> 00:55:54,709
My answer is simple, and it's always the same.

617
00:55:55,550 --> 00:55:57,151
I believe in Medford Public Schools.

618
00:55:57,891 --> 00:55:59,672
I believe our schools can be even better.

619
00:56:00,493 --> 00:56:06,237
I believe children deserve the best possible education, no matter what their abilities or resources are.

620
00:56:07,557 --> 00:56:15,220
I know I can add a new dimension to the school committee and am of the opinion that I can't expect anyone else to do a job I'm not willing to do myself.

621
00:56:16,641 --> 00:56:23,564
Among the issues I would promote as a committee member is the continued progress being made at the Medford Vocational Technical High School and Medford High School.

622
00:56:24,605 --> 00:56:29,767
Medford is one of the only local communities that's fortunate enough to have both schools as part of one campus.

623
00:56:30,923 --> 00:56:41,051
Efforts to integrate both schools need to continue with academic opportunities for the students of the voc tech expanding and career and technical opportunities for high school students being cultivated.

624
00:56:42,132 --> 00:56:46,435
New shops as well as renovations and acquiring up-to-date equipment should be a top priority.

625
00:56:47,476 --> 00:56:51,459
I truly believe career and technical education needs to be prioritized.

626
00:56:52,139 --> 00:56:55,742
Not every student will take an academic path toward a four-year college.

627
00:56:56,907 --> 00:57:02,651
We need to make sure the education we provide them ensures they will be well prepared and successful in the careers they chose.

628
00:57:03,592 --> 00:57:08,196
Bolstering our community education offerings could provide revenue to see this progress continue.

629
00:57:09,577 --> 00:57:15,341
My oldest children were among the first class of students to attend the new elementary schools from kindergarten through fifth grade.

630
00:57:16,582 --> 00:57:23,127
Throughout the years, these schools have not been funded for proper maintenance, forcing reactive repairs versus proactive routine yearly maintenance.

631
00:57:23,890 --> 00:57:31,792
In order for these buildings to properly serve Medford students for the long term, it is essential that a proper maintenance schedule be funded and implemented.

632
00:57:33,132 --> 00:57:35,632
My family is fortunate enough to be able to walk to the Roberts.

633
00:57:36,153 --> 00:57:41,394
With that being said, I am acutely aware of the safety challenges students face while traveling to and from school.

634
00:57:42,334 --> 00:57:47,215
Issues with bus safety, overcrowding, and scheduling are recurring each year and should be addressed.

635
00:57:47,735 --> 00:57:52,496
Walkers face their own challenges with dangerous areas for crosswalks or no crosswalks at all.

636
00:57:53,165 --> 00:57:56,607
poor signage for school zones, and accessibility issues.

637
00:57:57,167 --> 00:57:59,789
All children deserve a safe route to and from school.

638
00:58:00,990 --> 00:58:03,951
Choosing to run for school committee was not a decision I made lightly.

639
00:58:04,752 --> 00:58:08,314
The issues listed previously were just part of the catalyst for my decision.

640
00:58:09,054 --> 00:58:12,056
If elected, I would work to be the voice of the parents and the students.

641
00:58:13,057 --> 00:58:16,899
Our schools do not operate solely on paper or within City Hall.

642
00:58:17,759 --> 00:58:22,382
I am determined to take the politics out of the committee and make decisions regarding our schools

643
00:58:23,023 --> 00:58:28,805
a collaboration of all committee members, parents, and administrators, students, and community input.

644
00:58:30,045 --> 00:58:32,566
I respectfully ask for one of your votes on November 7th.

645
00:58:32,826 --> 00:58:33,206
Thank you.

646
00:58:34,386 --> 00:58:35,287
Thank you, Angela.

647
00:58:47,070 --> 00:58:51,292
Friends and neighbors, my name is Michael Leggero, and I'm running for school committee.

648
00:58:51,592 --> 00:58:52,292
Let me tell you why.

649
00:58:53,297 --> 00:58:54,938
Somewhere in Medford, a baby was born.

650
00:58:55,679 --> 00:58:59,901
Lovely, curious, and if anything like my pumpkins, a bit of a troublemaker.

651
00:59:00,702 --> 00:59:04,704
Soon this beautiful child will be entering kindergarten with my son, Kason.

652
00:59:05,665 --> 00:59:11,148
Until I had a child, I could only see the rough outline of responsibility drawn by fatherhood.

653
00:59:12,109 --> 00:59:16,051
Yet being a parent has opened my eyes beyond the circle of my own family.

654
00:59:16,631 --> 00:59:22,655
As a math teacher with over seven years experience, I know education is destiny.

655
00:59:23,743 --> 00:59:28,907
Every kindergartner's future is shaped by the parents and administrators and teachers standing in front of them.

656
00:59:29,847 --> 00:59:31,608
It is an awesome responsibility.

657
00:59:32,029 --> 00:59:34,330
The parents of Medford invest in our school system.

658
00:59:34,891 --> 00:59:39,354
It is your responsibility to elect the most capable candidates onto our school committee.

659
00:59:39,914 --> 00:59:43,637
Thank you for your time and considering my unique set of experiences.

660
00:59:44,574 --> 00:59:47,895
But before I jabber on about myself, let's talk about our schools.

661
00:59:48,535 --> 00:59:56,598
The Mustangs make our city proud, but is it too outrageous to imagine our schools as the best in Massachusetts?

662
00:59:57,558 --> 01:00:02,620
In the 80s, Medford was placed at the top of almost every school ranking in Massachusetts.

663
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:06,561
People traveled the world to visit our schools, believe it or not.

664
01:00:07,821 --> 01:00:10,502
Now, well, we've fallen into the middle of the pack.

665
01:00:11,235 --> 01:00:11,455
U.S.

666
01:00:11,495 --> 01:00:19,981
News and World Report ranks Arlington 12th, Somerville 69th, Everett 89th in Massachusetts.

667
01:00:20,862 --> 01:00:23,263
Medford, we didn't even crack into the top 100.

668
01:00:24,724 --> 01:00:29,167
Great Schools, it's an online website, ranks our district 5 out of 10.

669
01:00:31,429 --> 01:00:34,371
Boston Magazine recently ranked Medford 89 out of 125 Boston-area schools.

670
01:00:37,885 --> 01:00:43,889
Our four-year graduation rate has fallen from 87% a few years ago to 80% now.

671
01:00:45,090 --> 01:00:46,751
These rankings are a wake-up call.

672
01:00:47,492 --> 01:00:49,934
All students should aim as high as possible.

673
01:00:50,174 --> 01:00:51,695
Let's not settle for okay.

674
01:00:52,616 --> 01:00:55,578
Let's make our schools the best in Massachusetts.

675
01:00:56,538 --> 01:00:57,119
No, strike that.

676
01:00:57,719 --> 01:01:00,942
Let's play as hard as our musk gangs fight.

677
01:01:01,562 --> 01:01:04,104
Let's be the best school in America.

678
01:01:05,229 --> 01:01:09,133
My teaching career has stretched from Philadelphia to Shanghai.

679
01:01:09,914 --> 01:01:15,599
I have experience teaching mathematics at both elite universities and highly ranked public schools.

680
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:22,405
I helped build a successful math team in Houston, and I hope you give me the opportunity to fortify the schools here in Medford.

681
01:01:23,313 --> 01:01:26,595
Currently, I run an organic blueberry farm in Massachusetts.

682
01:01:27,176 --> 01:01:29,618
As a small business owner, I know how to stretch a buck.

683
01:01:30,238 --> 01:01:34,121
I know that throwing money at a problem will not solve poor planning.

684
01:01:34,741 --> 01:01:36,803
Customers demand responsive business.

685
01:01:37,283 --> 01:01:40,165
I hope to add this type of responsiveness to our schools.

686
01:01:41,246 --> 01:01:43,207
Here's some plans to help us move forward.

687
01:01:43,908 --> 01:01:46,349
Because Henry won't give me 10 minutes, I only have time for four.

688
01:01:46,970 --> 01:01:49,912
First, we need to make our school committee more accessible.

689
01:01:50,637 --> 01:01:58,121
As a parent of two little boys, I can tell you from personal experience that 6.30 on a weekday is a tough time to make it.

690
01:01:59,021 --> 01:02:08,385
What I suggest is that we rotate our school committee meetings into the weekends, at least once a month, and provide parents with some entertainment for their kids.

691
01:02:08,886 --> 01:02:14,508
This way, excited kids and tired parents will have an opportunity to speak about what's going on with our schools.

692
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:18,802
Let's extend relationships with the local universities.

693
01:02:19,302 --> 01:02:21,403
Right now we have a really great relationship with Tufts.

694
01:02:22,084 --> 01:02:27,567
Let's look to schools like MIT and Harvard and open internship and lecture opportunities.

695
01:02:28,347 --> 01:02:32,750
Third, we need to reduce the disparities between the schools here in Medford.

696
01:02:33,851 --> 01:02:41,315
The Andrews and the McGlynn, for example, it is unacceptable that poverty rates at one school is half the poverty rate at the other school.

697
01:02:41,756 --> 01:02:43,637
We need to make sure that parity is achieved.

698
01:02:45,235 --> 01:02:49,398
Fourth, let's improve relationships with parents of special needs children.

699
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:57,464
By far the biggest complaint that I hear as I've been knocking on doors among parents is the resistance to individual education plans.

700
01:02:58,285 --> 01:03:02,408
As a teacher, I acted as a liaison between parents and administrators.

701
01:03:02,968 --> 01:03:05,630
I will continue this work on our school committee.

702
01:03:06,731 --> 01:03:12,335
My campaign is about creating the most successful and transparent school district in Massachusetts.

703
01:03:12,967 --> 01:03:17,750
If you have some time, check out my website, takegovernment.com, or call me directly.

704
01:03:17,970 --> 01:03:21,632
My home number is 781-866-2191.

705
01:03:21,832 --> 01:03:25,394
I'm always happy to talk, hopefully after my boys are in bed.

706
01:03:26,475 --> 01:03:28,316
The children of Medford deserve the best.

707
01:03:28,856 --> 01:03:32,158
Join me, and let's take our schools from good to great.

708
01:03:49,846 --> 01:03:54,568
Hello, I'm Erin DiBenedetto and I'm running for re-election to the Method School Committee.

709
01:03:55,449 --> 01:04:03,133
My goal as a committee member is to be a leader who has the experience and the relationships to deliver a solid innovation for Method.

710
01:04:04,493 --> 01:04:11,637
Having served three terms on the Method School Committee, I'm bringing my record of fighting for residents and community organizing to our city.

711
01:04:12,738 --> 01:04:20,100
As a school committee member, I commit to work to make sure everyone in our district has the opportunity to succeed.

712
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:24,901
I promise to be that honest voice of reason for all our Meffitt children.

713
01:04:26,021 --> 01:04:34,763
My husband Joe and I moved to Meffitt in 1987 and raised our two children, both of which graduated from Meffitt High School.

714
01:04:35,623 --> 01:04:42,465
Joey is a graduate of Worcester State University and is getting his master's degree in public health

715
01:04:43,602 --> 01:04:49,967
And my Caitlin, she's a graduate of Tufts University and is getting her degree as a nurse practitioner.

716
01:04:51,268 --> 01:05:02,337
My job as a special education coordinator for Prospect Hill Academy, where I advocate for children, gives me a unique insight to improving our schools.

717
01:05:03,318 --> 01:05:07,561
I bring my knowledge of working in a school every day to our committee.

718
01:05:08,962 --> 01:05:12,025
In 2011, when my youngest graduated,

719
01:05:12,526 --> 01:05:21,593
I decided to run for Medford School Committee because my voice needed to be heard and because all children deserve the best education a city can offer.

720
01:05:23,635 --> 01:05:34,783
Some of the things that have been accomplished while working with other members of the committee have been to ensure we have a balanced budget with any need for supplemental appropriations.

721
01:05:35,704 --> 01:05:40,768
Our committee has creatively and resourcefully developed additional sources of revenue.

722
01:05:42,051 --> 01:05:50,253
The planning and implementation of technology upgrades and our new science labs at Meffitt High School are major accomplishments.

723
01:05:50,913 --> 01:06:00,155
These projects are not only offering the best education for our high school students, but they have increased programming for our vocational students.

724
01:06:01,115 --> 01:06:04,976
As a committee, we have reviewed new legislation regularly,

725
01:06:05,770 --> 01:06:13,255
Our committees have submitted medical emergency plans, concussion plans, and bullying plans to the state.

726
01:06:14,256 --> 01:06:20,620
Upgrades have been made at our Curtis Tufts School, as well as our Kids' Corner for our youngest learners.

727
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:24,382
We have worked hard to keep our class size small.

728
01:06:25,443 --> 01:06:33,108
We have purchased new ELA and math programs for our elementary schools, and there have been many, many more accomplishments.

729
01:06:34,617 --> 01:06:46,022
When involved in interviewing and hiring our new principals or evaluating our superintendent, we always try to be the voice of the parents and the students in our community.

730
01:06:47,363 --> 01:06:50,905
While we have done some amazing work, there is much more to do.

731
01:06:51,625 --> 01:07:01,450
As a committee, we need to ensure our students are prepared to compete globally for spots at our country's best universities.

732
01:07:02,190 --> 01:07:14,698
We are responsible to make sure the programs offered to our children are supported with the material and the supplies needed for our students to have maximum access to the curriculum.

733
01:07:15,538 --> 01:07:22,903
We need to preserve our traditional vocational programs while we keep pace with the changing needs in our workforce.

734
01:07:23,864 --> 01:07:29,067
We need to analyze our testing scores and make sure we are meeting the needs of all our students

735
01:07:29,578 --> 01:07:32,799
So they all have every opportunity to excel.

736
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:42,303
We need to build online learning opportunities so all students have a way to access the curriculum and we meet all our children's needs.

737
01:07:44,424 --> 01:07:52,227
We need to invest in our buildings to maintain them for the years to come while working to keep our students and staff safe.

738
01:07:53,305 --> 01:07:59,247
We need to have open communication with administration, teachers, students, and parents.

739
01:08:00,328 --> 01:08:12,413
In the coming years, this committee may be involved in hiring a new superintendent of schools, which I think is going to be one of the most important roles our future committee will be undertaking.

740
01:08:13,913 --> 01:08:22,377
I've learned from my many years of community involvement that some of the best ideas in government come from the neighborhoods, not the bureaucrats.

741
01:08:23,562 --> 01:08:35,745
That's why I'm asking you to reach out to me at 781-254-0095 with any ideas or concerns or ways that I can help you or your child.

742
01:08:36,805 --> 01:08:48,527
That's also a reason, while I am asking for your vote on November 7th to continue my work to be the honest voice of reason for all our Method children.

743
01:08:48,908 --> 01:08:49,328
Thank you.

744
01:08:49,348 --> 01:08:50,728
Thank you, Erin.

745
01:09:03,221 --> 01:09:03,781
Hi, everybody.

746
01:09:04,261 --> 01:09:08,302
My name is Kathy Miles-Kretz, and I'm running for re-election for Memphis School Committee.

747
01:09:08,682 --> 01:09:15,684
I just want to simply say thank you to Henley Miller and the Democratic Ward Committee for having this candidate night.

748
01:09:17,444 --> 01:09:22,305
So I'm running for re-election for Memphis School Committee, and I'm a Medford High School graduate.

749
01:09:22,405 --> 01:09:24,065
I grew up in Medford.

750
01:09:24,105 --> 01:09:26,106
My parents moved here when I was four months old.

751
01:09:26,706 --> 01:09:29,767
I went to the Waite School, which was the neighborhood school.

752
01:09:30,147 --> 01:09:31,347
I went to the Hobbs Junior High.

753
01:09:31,881 --> 01:09:35,043
I went to Medford High School and I graduated class of 1990.

754
01:09:35,663 --> 01:09:46,048
My husband graduated Medford Vocational one year before me and my son, like his dad, is enrolled in the Medford Vocational High School and he's enrolled in the robotics engineering program.

755
01:09:47,108 --> 01:09:52,031
Immediately after graduating high school, I went to college and I went to Suffolk University.

756
01:09:52,071 --> 01:10:00,655
I commuted and I worked two jobs while going to college so that I could maintain work and school and paying some of my education.

757
01:10:01,637 --> 01:10:05,098
After I graduated college, I immediately began working at State Street.

758
01:10:05,198 --> 01:10:18,804
I worked there for 13 years, and then shortly after my son, who I adopted, came over here from Korea, I wanted to work from home, so I established my own licensed family daycare business, so I could stay home and take care of him.

759
01:10:19,184 --> 01:10:23,365
When he went to kindergarten, I started working at Mass Teachers Retirement System.

760
01:10:24,286 --> 01:10:28,007
So shortly after my son moved on from middle school to high school,

761
01:10:28,547 --> 01:10:33,791
I missed the interactions at the elementary school and the middle school levels, and I was interested in running for school committee.

762
01:10:34,112 --> 01:10:36,274
So I ran the first time, and here I am running again.

763
01:10:37,374 --> 01:10:52,887
And some of the accomplishments that I have to talk about while I was on school committee in my first term were, I set out that for my plan was that I was going to go out to each and every school, meet with the principals, do a site tour, and do classroom observations.

764
01:10:53,048 --> 01:10:53,748
And I did that.

765
01:10:53,908 --> 01:10:54,769
I accomplished that.

766
01:10:55,223 --> 01:10:59,004
and I have some great stories to share about going to the classroom observations.

767
01:10:59,484 --> 01:11:23,971
I went out to each elementary school, and I went to the Roberts Elementary, and I sat through a little observation in the kindergarten where the students were doing K-Focus, and the little group I was put with was doing acting out dramatic play, The Three Little Pigs, and they were cutting out with construction paper, and they were kind of acting out The Three Little Pigs.

768
01:11:23,991 --> 01:11:24,871
It was just amazing.

769
01:11:25,325 --> 01:11:27,627
I've been to the Columbus Elementary School.

770
01:11:27,667 --> 01:11:29,348
The children were writing out commercials.

771
01:11:29,768 --> 01:11:35,792
Later that year, I was invited back to go see the commercials acted out, and they walked down the red carpet.

772
01:11:36,253 --> 01:11:44,178
I've been to the Brooks Elementary, where the students were dressed up to portray somebody in history, and they recited who they were representing.

773
01:11:44,678 --> 01:11:52,684
I've been to the McGlynn Elementary to see their hydroponics project, and the day I went, the lettuce that they were growing was ready to be cut,

774
01:11:53,068 --> 01:11:56,751
So we had a taste testing, and the students brought in some of their salad dressings.

775
01:11:57,211 --> 01:12:05,818
So one of my things that I've been doing is just going out to the schools and being there and seeing what the students are doing, working with the teachers and the administrators.

776
01:12:06,178 --> 01:12:07,499
And I want to continue doing that.

777
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:10,482
I've been on field trips with the middle school.

778
01:12:10,942 --> 01:12:13,664
We went to the Museum of Science.

779
01:12:14,064 --> 01:12:15,946
I've been on a field trip with the high school.

780
01:12:15,986 --> 01:12:17,487
We went to the Day at the Hill.

781
01:12:17,867 --> 01:12:19,168
I want to continue to do that.

782
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:24,264
I've been a very big advocate for the Medford Vocational Schools.

783
01:12:24,984 --> 01:12:26,426
We have 20 programs.

784
01:12:26,786 --> 01:12:30,370
We've reduced our students going to Minuteman, so we're saving money.

785
01:12:30,831 --> 01:12:35,476
We have a partnership with Everett, and we have tuition coming in from Everett.

786
01:12:35,496 --> 01:12:38,138
Students are taking courses at the Medford Vocational School.

787
01:12:38,659 --> 01:12:43,264
I'm on the Robotics Engineering Advisory Committee, and I'm just so very proud of

788
01:12:44,176 --> 01:12:46,618
all of the equipment that we have in our robotics shop.

789
01:12:46,658 --> 01:12:49,120
We started out with just 3D printers.

790
01:12:49,180 --> 01:13:04,290
We have a CNC, we have a mill, a lathe, we have a water jet, we have equipment that's industry ready that compares to some of our local colleges that I've seen when I've gone on college tours.

791
01:13:04,370 --> 01:13:10,274
It's just incredible what our students know and what they're learning right now, hands on.

792
01:13:10,614 --> 01:13:11,735
They're going on co-ops.

793
01:13:12,235 --> 01:13:19,720
at companies and they're earning above $6 above minimum wage right now while they're in high school seniors.

794
01:13:20,140 --> 01:13:20,841
It's incredible.

795
01:13:20,981 --> 01:13:32,909
I am so proud of our Medford Vocational and Medford High School and I'm happy to say that right now all of our students graduate from Medford High School, Medford Folk are now under one.

796
01:13:33,463 --> 01:13:36,605
And they can now access post-secondary education.

797
01:13:36,945 --> 01:13:38,006
They can go to college.

798
01:13:38,366 --> 01:13:39,726
They can go to career.

799
01:13:40,047 --> 01:13:41,247
They can go in the union.

800
01:13:41,928 --> 01:13:44,069
That option is there for all of our students.

801
01:13:44,209 --> 01:13:48,071
And we made that possible with the merger that just happened.

802
01:13:48,551 --> 01:13:49,812
There's still a lot to be done.

803
01:13:50,475 --> 01:13:58,280
and I look forward to the next couple of years, so I appreciate your vote for another term on the Memphis School Committee.

804
01:13:58,561 --> 01:13:59,361
Thank you very much.

805
01:13:59,401 --> 01:14:01,543
Remember to vote November 7th.

806
01:14:01,603 --> 01:14:03,804
Kathy Kretz, re-elect Memphis School Committee.

807
01:14:03,944 --> 01:14:04,825
Thank you very much.

808
01:14:05,445 --> 01:14:06,306
Thank you, Kathy.

809
01:14:07,787 --> 01:14:09,188
Next, Kathleen Cullinan.

810
01:14:20,859 --> 01:14:21,019
Hi.

811
01:14:21,279 --> 01:14:22,120
Good evening, everyone.

812
01:14:23,221 --> 01:14:25,563
My name is Katie Ma Cullinane.

813
01:14:26,984 --> 01:14:28,826
On the ballot, it's Kathleen Cullinane.

814
01:14:29,246 --> 01:14:30,507
Most people know me as Katie.

815
01:14:30,567 --> 01:14:31,488
I grew up in Medford.

816
01:14:33,590 --> 01:14:35,271
And I am one of seven.

817
01:14:36,412 --> 01:14:38,954
The Ma's go back for a long way.

818
01:14:39,515 --> 01:14:41,677
But I went through the school system.

819
01:14:42,377 --> 01:14:43,778
I went to the Dame School.

820
01:14:44,219 --> 01:14:47,822
From the Dame, I went to Lincoln Junior High, where I met my husband, Scott.

821
01:14:49,755 --> 01:14:54,277
And from there, I graduated Medford High School, class of 1989.

822
01:14:55,158 --> 01:15:00,200
My husband graduated 1989 also from the Medford Vocational School.

823
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:03,782
From there, I went to nursing school, Library College in Boston.

824
01:15:05,063 --> 01:15:08,004
And I worked in the nursing field for years.

825
01:15:08,764 --> 01:15:12,166
I also got married to my husband.

826
01:15:12,986 --> 01:15:13,947
We have three children.

827
01:15:14,827 --> 01:15:18,209
And with that, I'm a mother of three, Mary, Kate, Megan, and Liam.

828
01:15:19,030 --> 01:15:25,295
And I've seen our community transform from small neighborhood schools into the 21st century.

829
01:15:26,376 --> 01:15:30,079
And we have better facilities, stronger core for the education.

830
01:15:31,019 --> 01:15:34,983
We've had technology updates and community outreach.

831
01:15:35,743 --> 01:15:40,006
However, despite all these changes, there's always room for greatness and improvement.

832
01:15:41,528 --> 01:15:44,910
Mary Kate and Megan are attending college right now.

833
01:15:45,110 --> 01:15:46,432
My son, Liam, is a senior.

834
01:15:48,724 --> 01:15:55,249
Throughout Mary-Kate and Megan's career in the academics of our school system, they struggled.

835
01:15:56,270 --> 01:16:02,354
But with that, they were able to achieve what they needed to do to get to college.

836
01:16:02,414 --> 01:16:07,558
They were on IEPs, which is an early individualized education plan.

837
01:16:08,799 --> 01:16:18,006
But I was a strong advocate to make sure that they were able to move on and be successful and attend college right now.

838
01:16:20,833 --> 01:16:25,235
As far as special education, like I said, I am a strong advocate.

839
01:16:27,956 --> 01:16:34,579
And there's a lot of programs that we could do to make our school system much better.

840
01:16:35,699 --> 01:16:50,526
As far as special education, there is most people, I'm not sure if you know this, 20% of the Americans who have a disability, which means that one fifth of our population

841
01:16:52,393 --> 01:16:53,493
you know, needs money.

842
01:16:53,813 --> 01:16:55,954
So we need to advocate for that.

843
01:16:56,754 --> 01:17:00,215
So one-fifth of the budget should go towards special education.

844
01:17:01,096 --> 01:17:10,638
Also, we are coming into times where social emotional learning is a big thing within our system.

845
01:17:10,938 --> 01:17:16,420
And there are some programs out there as far as Open Circle, which is a research program.

846
01:17:17,011 --> 01:17:22,812
that I know is done in other school systems, which would be great if we could have that in our approach.

847
01:17:25,233 --> 01:17:37,875
Like I said, we also have the opioid crisis right now, which maybe we can revamp our DARE program.

848
01:17:38,275 --> 01:17:44,117
As of before, we used to address the current issues, and our issues have changed, obviously.

849
01:17:46,163 --> 01:17:51,144
possibly do community partnership with our police officers and revamp everything.

850
01:17:52,164 --> 01:17:56,965
For example, the drunk driving issue was the big issue back when I was in school.

851
01:17:57,945 --> 01:18:09,667
But as of now, in a whole, we had 250 drunk driving death related deaths with the drinking and driving as compared to 2,500 10 years ago.

852
01:18:10,567 --> 01:18:13,408
Our new focus is marijuana.

853
01:18:13,886 --> 01:18:23,810
the opiates, and we need to change our program as far as being more aware and not being afraid to have different programs within our system.

854
01:18:25,430 --> 01:18:30,512
Cultural enhancements, we face changes every day.

855
01:18:30,712 --> 01:18:32,733
The demographics of Medford are changing.

856
01:18:33,313 --> 01:18:36,274
We need to keep our city alive.

857
01:18:36,354 --> 01:18:39,856
As far as when I grew up, we always took field trips to the Royal House.

858
01:18:40,336 --> 01:18:40,976
That was big.

859
01:18:41,950 --> 01:18:49,254
And the Paul Revere run, which is in April, Patriot's Day, he would come down Main Street, stop at the Craddock Bridge.

860
01:18:49,814 --> 01:18:50,934
We need to keep that alive.

861
01:18:51,655 --> 01:18:59,779
We need to enhance what we have within our city to make it better, not to just learn about everything else.

862
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:01,279
We need to keep Medford alive.

863
01:19:01,319 --> 01:19:02,380
Medford's a great city.

864
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:06,862
Like I said, I've grown up here my whole life, stayed here, was educated.

865
01:19:07,830 --> 01:19:08,291
15 seconds.

866
01:19:08,591 --> 01:19:09,311
And thank you.

867
01:19:09,692 --> 01:19:10,572
I'm a little bit nervous.

868
01:19:10,612 --> 01:19:11,393
I've got to be honest.

869
01:19:11,893 --> 01:19:14,115
But I appreciate your vote, November 7th.

870
01:19:14,675 --> 01:19:15,516
And thank you again.

871
01:19:15,536 --> 01:19:16,636
I appreciate everything.

872
01:19:17,497 --> 01:19:18,458
Thank you, Kathleen.

873
01:19:18,678 --> 01:19:19,098
Thank you.

874
01:19:19,118 --> 01:19:27,364
It's on now.

875
01:19:27,444 --> 01:19:27,984
Now it's on.

876
01:19:28,024 --> 01:19:28,525
Thanks, Paul.

877
01:19:30,746 --> 01:19:32,868
I'm trying to stay awake.

878
01:19:34,816 --> 01:19:35,657
My name is Paul Rousseau.

879
01:19:35,697 --> 01:19:38,339
I'm a candidate for school committee, as you probably have guessed.

880
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:45,685
I'd like to thank the Medford Democratic City and Ward 6 committees for hosting this event.

881
01:19:45,725 --> 01:19:49,648
I think it's really important that everybody has a chance to see us.

882
01:19:51,730 --> 01:19:54,032
I think it's a little better than yard signs.

883
01:19:55,813 --> 01:20:01,258
I'd also most importantly like to thank you all for taking time out of your very busy weeks to come out here tonight.

884
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:08,843
I live in the hillside neighborhood with my husband, Bob, whom I don't think made it.

885
01:20:08,883 --> 01:20:10,684
My kids probably weren't up for this.

886
01:20:12,545 --> 01:20:19,189
Our son, Matthew, is a student at the Andrews Middle School, and our daughter, Nev, is a student at Columbus Elementary.

887
01:20:20,810 --> 01:20:28,174
I'm a software engineer by profession, and I've worked at Partners Healthcare for 20 years, and yes, I do have the best commute right now in the world.

888
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:43,985
I have a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Keene State College in New Hampshire and a Master of, I have the longest Master's name in the world, a Master of Science in Human Factors and Information Design, it really says that, from Bentley University.

889
01:20:46,046 --> 01:20:53,708
Since our first child entered school at Columbus seven years ago, my family has been very involved in the PTO.

890
01:20:55,489 --> 01:20:58,350
I've been volunteering every year to go on field trips,

891
01:20:59,945 --> 01:21:01,686
The buses are really a blast.

892
01:21:05,228 --> 01:21:12,091
And I've also co-led the Computer Science Club at the Columbus, which is an enrichment program after school.

893
01:21:13,092 --> 01:21:15,373
We've had really excellent teachers.

894
01:21:15,813 --> 01:21:21,696
Every single teacher has been amazing, and I feel very fortunate that we've had such a great experience.

895
01:21:22,316 --> 01:21:27,899
We've also had experiences in the special education system, and they have all actually been positive.

896
01:21:29,329 --> 01:21:34,671
So I think we have an excellent foundation for our schools to build upon.

897
01:21:34,691 --> 01:21:42,174
I do not believe we need to make massive changes to see some pretty incredible improvements.

898
01:21:42,995 --> 01:21:47,496
Sometimes small changes can have a great impact.

899
01:21:48,337 --> 01:21:52,618
That said, we do have some pretty substantial challenges that we have to address head on.

900
01:21:54,219 --> 01:21:57,180
Some of my fellow candidates have mentioned maintenance.

901
01:22:00,025 --> 01:22:05,329
perhaps not maintain the wonderful schools we built 15, 16 years ago as well as we should have.

902
01:22:06,469 --> 01:22:14,035
I think that we need to do more than deal with the daily crisis list of maintenance issues and have every single facility analyzed top to bottom.

903
01:22:15,055 --> 01:22:21,960
And we need to plan for what we're going to need to spend this year, what we're going to need to spend next year, three, four, five years from now even.

904
01:22:22,838 --> 01:22:33,825
The equipment failures that are gonna happen, and many of them are already happening, are completely predictable, and we shouldn't have to deal with them only on a crisis, in crisis mode.

905
01:22:35,566 --> 01:22:46,292
So I propose that we do something a little different, that we actually have a set of kind of principles on how we prioritize maintenance instead of just what's the current crisis today.

906
01:22:47,313 --> 01:22:50,895
So I think we should be addressing all of our maintenance issues

907
01:22:52,138 --> 01:22:53,638
First, by safety issues.

908
01:22:54,319 --> 01:22:58,361
Second, by whether or not, how they impact education, things that impact education.

909
01:22:58,781 --> 01:23:01,803
And then finally, and really lastly, should be cosmetics.

910
01:23:02,303 --> 01:23:05,565
And I know that's not always popular because we all see the cosmetics.

911
01:23:07,066 --> 01:23:09,107
But that's what I think.

912
01:23:10,868 --> 01:23:14,110
We also need to implement a computer science curriculum.

913
01:23:14,150 --> 01:23:17,592
Now, we have some computer science elements in our education now.

914
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:19,393
We have some program classes here and there.

915
01:23:20,616 --> 01:23:25,240
and everything that is being done is great, but a curriculum is not what we have.

916
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:28,803
A curriculum in computer science is kindergarten through 12th grade.

917
01:23:29,304 --> 01:23:39,894
It is sewn together in a meaningful way so that, you know, you don't just get to middle school and if you happen to be the geeks that know how to program, you take the programming classes.

918
01:23:40,875 --> 01:23:43,317
It's, it's, every student needs this for our

919
01:23:44,794 --> 01:23:49,156
Certainly colleges are expecting it and most of them are not getting it from kids out of high school.

920
01:23:50,857 --> 01:23:53,939
Many, many jobs expect you to know more than how to type.

921
01:23:56,720 --> 01:24:00,342
We need to do some access issues at the elementary schools.

922
01:24:00,362 --> 01:24:12,428
We don't have late buses at the elementary schools, so all that wonderful remediation that can be done through tutoring that is there is not accessible to all of the students.

923
01:24:13,741 --> 01:24:15,762
This is kind of a cheap thing, in my opinion.

924
01:24:16,122 --> 01:24:22,203
We can spend some money early on remediating kids that need help, and then... 15 seconds.

925
01:24:22,283 --> 01:24:22,703
All right.

926
01:24:22,963 --> 01:24:25,284
And then not spend so much money later on.

927
01:24:26,764 --> 01:24:29,825
I have a lot on special education that I wanted to talk about.

928
01:24:29,845 --> 01:24:37,987
We need to focus on the transitions of our kids around special education, getting into special education and going between the schools.

929
01:24:39,867 --> 01:24:40,267
Thank you.

930
01:24:42,608 --> 01:24:43,068
Thank you, Paul.

931
01:24:51,385 --> 01:24:54,994
I believe all the candidates have done extremely well.

932
01:24:55,917 --> 01:24:58,904
Why don't we give them a round of applause for their well done.

933
01:25:09,102 --> 01:25:21,601
Before we depart tonight, we just want to, um, I just want to, my co-moderator, Henry Malorin, and I just want to thank all of those who assisted us in putting this event on this year, especially representative Paul Donato and Nancy White, the co-chairs of the Medford

934
01:25:22,045 --> 01:25:23,306
City Democratic Ward Committee.

935
01:25:23,346 --> 01:25:24,806
We thank them for their continued support.

936
01:25:25,126 --> 01:25:27,347
We thank our television crew member, Ralph Surrett.

937
01:25:27,367 --> 01:25:32,269
We thank the Medford Transcript, Medford Patch, and every other media that helped advertise the event.

938
01:25:32,549 --> 01:25:37,211
And most certainly, we need to thank the members of the Medford Ward 6 Committee.

939
01:25:37,571 --> 01:25:39,392
Please stand up so you can be seen.

940
01:25:46,179 --> 01:25:49,321
And with that said, don't forget to vote.

941
01:25:49,621 --> 01:25:56,665
This event has been taped, recorded, and will be replayed on channel 22 for Comcast.

942
01:25:57,345 --> 01:25:58,946
It's been carried live and 43 for.

943
01:26:02,044 --> 01:26:02,644
Verizon.

944
01:26:03,325 --> 01:26:12,092
Next Wednesday, six days from today, we will be here again with 14 candidates running for city councilor.

945
01:26:12,532 --> 01:26:18,497
And I wish, I hope, you guys will turn in for them because they are representing you, not me.

946
01:26:19,077 --> 01:26:22,480
Okay, see, with my accent, you think I'm from another world, right?

947
01:26:23,173 --> 01:26:24,154
But not me.

948
01:26:24,254 --> 01:26:35,720
So again, a reminder, the last day to register to vote on this upcoming municipal election is next Wednesday, October the 18th.

949
01:26:36,161 --> 01:26:40,783
You can come here downstairs at the city clerk to register a voter to get it done.

950
01:26:40,823 --> 01:26:44,245
You can do it online, whichever way you do it if you want to vote.

951
01:26:44,666 --> 01:26:46,146
I do thank you all.

952
01:26:46,727 --> 01:26:48,248
OK, God bless our city.

953
01:26:48,588 --> 01:26:49,789
And good luck to all of you.

954
01:26:50,029 --> 01:26:50,369
Good night.
