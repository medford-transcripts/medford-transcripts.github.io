1
00:00:04,914 --> 00:00:07,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey Medford Bites listeners, and happy Valentine's Day.

2
00:00:07,817 --> 00:00:11,460
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen until the end of today's episode to hear some special Valentine's Day messages.

3
00:00:12,381 --> 00:00:16,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Today's interview is with two very special Medford residents, David Harris and Barry Ingber.

4
00:00:17,646 --> 00:00:29,476
[SPEAKER_03]: David Harris, now retired, has been recognized as a leading voice for civil rights in the Boston region and has spoken extensively at local, regional, and national forums on civil rights, regional equity, and fair housing.

5
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:37,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Barry Ingber, also retired, is a community activist and organizer working with local groups including People Power and Safe Medford.

6
00:00:38,324 --> 00:00:43,308
[SPEAKER_03]: In the following interview, David Harris speaks with great pride about being a resident of West Medford.

7
00:00:44,028 --> 00:00:50,954
[SPEAKER_03]: To introduce today's interview, I'll read an excerpt from the prologue of A Legacy Remembered, The African American Community in Medford.

8
00:00:51,534 --> 00:01:04,046
[SPEAKER_03]: created and edited by Kristen Johnson, Anne Knolling, and the West Medford Remembrance Committee, who include Wallace Kuntz, Dorothy Elizabeth Tucker, Maureen Sani, Robert Fury, and John Reed.

9
00:01:04,927 --> 00:01:12,213
[SPEAKER_03]: Focusing on the history of West Medford and the residents that have made their mark on Medford, the prologue states, the concern about losing this history is real.

10
00:01:13,074 --> 00:01:19,397
[SPEAKER_03]: We refer to ours as lost history, a story that is fading as quickly as our elders die and our families move away.

11
00:01:20,258 --> 00:01:23,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the history of this neighborhood resides with the memories of these few remaining elders.

12
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:32,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Our families live in the neighborhood between Boston Avenue and Mystic River Road, some of whom are direct descendants of the original African American settlers.

13
00:01:33,064 --> 00:01:39,228
[SPEAKER_03]: They built a community despite times of unspoken discrimination, involuntary segregation, and economic hardship.

14
00:01:40,068 --> 00:01:44,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Within a few city blocks, our ancestors wove a tapestry of support among neighbors.

15
00:01:45,053 --> 00:02:03,472
[SPEAKER_03]: They established small businesses that nourished their families and enhanced the community, created networks that protected and advanced next generations in ways that they never experienced themselves, and over time solidified their reputations as a substantial and effective advocacy group for this independent African-American neighborhood.

16
00:02:04,595 --> 00:02:09,823
[SPEAKER_03]: A Legacy Remembered includes moving tributes to many of these important and historical Medford residents.

17
00:02:10,364 --> 00:02:13,248
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a copy from the Medford Public Library and recommend checking it out.

18
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:18,857
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully, it's a helpful supplement to listening to David share his thoughts and feelings in this interview.

19
00:02:18,877 --> 00:02:20,139
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you enjoy.

20
00:02:29,898 --> 00:02:32,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you both for joining me today.

21
00:02:32,279 --> 00:02:38,222
[SPEAKER_03]: But if we could start just by introducing yourselves, saying your names, pronouns, and just a bit about yourself.

22
00:02:42,143 --> 00:02:45,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'm Barry Ingber.

23
00:02:46,105 --> 00:02:51,967
[SPEAKER_02]: I identify as he and I've lived in Medford for 35 years.

24
00:02:54,030 --> 00:03:09,523
[SPEAKER_02]: I am a retired activist in Medford and my career was spent largely working, primarily working in nonprofits with low income and diverse communities.

25
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:13,846
[SPEAKER_02]: And I began my career as a low income community organizer.

26
00:03:13,866 --> 00:03:15,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

27
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:18,452
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, listen, I'm glad to be here.

28
00:03:18,612 --> 00:03:20,814
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm David Harris, I use the he series.

29
00:03:22,016 --> 00:03:25,640
[SPEAKER_01]: I am recently retired.

30
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:29,284
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been a resident of West Medford for 27 years.

31
00:03:30,885 --> 00:03:36,151
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I've had a career in civil rights and race and justice and I have a

32
00:03:37,012 --> 00:03:39,653
[SPEAKER_01]: a graduate degree doctorate in sociology.

33
00:03:40,813 --> 00:03:49,416
[SPEAKER_01]: And I retired from the Charles Hamilton Institute for Race and Justice at Harvard Law School last May.

34
00:03:49,436 --> 00:03:54,457
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm really pleased to be here and be part of this conversation.

35
00:03:55,612 --> 00:03:55,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

36
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:59,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Congrats on your retirement and thanks for making the time.

37
00:04:00,376 --> 00:04:02,698
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have a really important conversation to get to today.

38
00:04:02,838 --> 00:04:11,305
[SPEAKER_03]: And before we get to that, the sort of common thread for the episodes is to ask folks what their favorite place to eat is in Medford and what they like to eat there.

39
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:16,309
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you said that, so I'll do this one first.

40
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:21,874
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really, this is really terrible, but I'm going to give a huge plug to Goldilocks.

41
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,401
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, huge Goldilocks, that's it, okay?

42
00:04:30,443 --> 00:04:36,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, for me, it's like, are we talking pre-pandemic or are we talking now?

43
00:04:38,387 --> 00:04:49,232
[SPEAKER_02]: My favorite place to get takeout is from the Tom Yum Kung, and I love their superior duck.

44
00:04:50,813 --> 00:04:52,153
[SPEAKER_01]: That's if you can get through the door, right?

45
00:04:55,186 --> 00:04:56,767
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we were just there the other day.

46
00:04:56,887 --> 00:04:57,767
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a good, that's right.

47
00:04:57,987 --> 00:04:58,347
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good.

48
00:04:58,627 --> 00:05:07,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I talked to Shannon Heaton, who's like a community member and an artist, and she spent some time living in Thailand and also listed that as her favorite restaurant.

49
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,470
[SPEAKER_03]: So that feels like a good endorsement.

50
00:05:09,071 --> 00:05:09,791
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's true.

51
00:05:10,162 --> 00:05:13,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so I'd ask you both to join me.

52
00:05:13,523 --> 00:05:21,425
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this idea came out of the holiday celebration at City Hall just last month.

53
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:33,608
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this idea of trying to have conversations about inclusivity in a broader way and just thinking about it as something that we hope for the community of Medford and thinking about

54
00:05:34,895 --> 00:05:41,257
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hoping that, David, you can talk a little bit about your work around this topic and Barry as well.

55
00:05:42,358 --> 00:05:45,239
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I think maybe we can start there.

56
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:48,340
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

57
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:55,322
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, I want to say I'm really tickled and glad to be able to be in this conversation with you and with Barry.

58
00:05:57,183 --> 00:06:02,625
[SPEAKER_01]: It's important to me as a resident of Medford for us to tackle these kinds of things in the city.

59
00:06:04,266 --> 00:06:23,326
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I think of, I have a kind of historical perspective and I know we're probably all worn out with all the 1619 talk and controversy, but I do think that, I want to make a point by starting there.

60
00:06:23,987 --> 00:06:31,211
[SPEAKER_01]: First, I'll start by saying that there were Africans on these shores 100 years before 1619, as we know.

61
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:45,379
[SPEAKER_01]: But 1619 is relevant for American history because we know sometime in late August, some unknown number of captured Africans landed on these shores.

62
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,660
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just acknowledged that a couple of years ago.

63
00:06:49,502 --> 00:07:02,785
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Donald Trump might be the only person who acknowledged that on July 30th of 1619 was the first convening of representative government in the English colonies.

64
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:10,807
[SPEAKER_01]: And that assembly included propertied white Christian men only.

65
00:07:12,767 --> 00:07:18,789
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only did it exclude the Africans who hadn't arrived yet, it excluded women, excluded native people, excluded those who didn't own property.

66
00:07:19,998 --> 00:07:26,246
[SPEAKER_01]: And this little snippet, those few weeks, to me, encapsulate American history.

67
00:07:27,127 --> 00:07:29,650
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a history of exclusion.

68
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:36,578
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of that exclusion is the imprecision with which the arrival of these Africans is recorded.

69
00:07:36,698 --> 00:07:39,321
[SPEAKER_01]: It's incidental to our history.

70
00:07:40,770 --> 00:08:00,559
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that exclusion and the unimportance of those Africans, not to mention indigenous people, is then captured and enshrined in that beautifully written, eloquently phrased, we the people.

71
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:06,862
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a nation, we celebrate that almost as a sacred,

72
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:13,752
[SPEAKER_01]: oath, right, that we think of our nation as being formed by and for we the people.

73
00:08:14,392 --> 00:08:21,917
[SPEAKER_01]: But from the very beginning, from 1619 to 1787, that we the people has been limited.

74
00:08:22,838 --> 00:08:24,039
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has been exclusive.

75
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:32,304
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have been caught, I think, in the tension between this great lie

76
00:08:33,372 --> 00:08:46,278
[SPEAKER_01]: which is that we are the people, and a constant struggle, right, of those who have been excluded to be included, to be part of this society.

77
00:08:46,478 --> 00:09:01,905
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that tension clearly has played its way out over these centuries and continues to really haunt us in our regular and routine affairs, as I think as Barry can give some examples.

78
00:09:03,763 --> 00:09:03,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

79
00:09:05,283 --> 00:09:14,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, I also want to thank you, Danielle, for doing this and for inviting me here with David.

80
00:09:15,365 --> 00:09:20,226
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you, David, for setting that context.

81
00:09:20,966 --> 00:09:28,948
[SPEAKER_02]: So probably your audience is all familiar with what happened at the City Hall holiday extravaganza.

82
00:09:31,591 --> 00:09:40,255
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's a really good illustration of a lot of the dynamics that happen in the city.

83
00:09:40,876 --> 00:09:59,205
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanna skip over completely, I'm gonna figure we've processed at this point, how offensive the menorah, that menorah display was to Jews like myself in the city.

84
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:10,284
[SPEAKER_02]: and go to what if they had not done that?

85
00:10:11,704 --> 00:10:17,427
[SPEAKER_02]: What if they had done this display perfectly?

86
00:10:21,108 --> 00:10:28,351
[SPEAKER_02]: If the menorah wasn't backwards, if it wasn't illustrated with an anti-Semitic,

87
00:10:30,365 --> 00:10:33,826
[SPEAKER_02]: poster, what if they had done it right?

88
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:52,032
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we've got is this huge Christmas display festooning City Hall inside and out, and a desire to be inclusive.

89
00:10:53,273 --> 00:10:57,514
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be inclusive, the administration

90
00:10:58,178 --> 00:11:13,625
[SPEAKER_02]: or a person in the administration decides to have a table, a little table that includes a Hanukkah menorah, a Kwanzaa kenara, and a Christmas tree.

91
00:11:15,246 --> 00:11:26,351
[SPEAKER_02]: City Hall is festooned and you've got this little table that's set aside to illustrate African-American and Jewish culture.

92
00:11:27,665 --> 00:11:29,286
[SPEAKER_02]: and let's pretend that they did it right.

93
00:11:30,867 --> 00:11:31,568
[SPEAKER_02]: What is that?

94
00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:33,469
[SPEAKER_02]: What is that?

95
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:36,371
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like a little corner of nothing.

96
00:11:38,153 --> 00:11:39,033
[SPEAKER_02]: It's meaningless.

97
00:11:40,354 --> 00:11:42,175
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not inclusion.

98
00:11:43,076 --> 00:11:44,077
[SPEAKER_02]: It's tokenism.

99
00:11:45,518 --> 00:11:56,586
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have to think about, OK, when you look at this tokenism, which as a Jew, I didn't feel like that

100
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:02,006
[SPEAKER_02]: affirmed me in any way or would have if it were done right.

101
00:12:03,047 --> 00:12:11,369
[SPEAKER_02]: What I would have felt was it's taking what's actually a minor holiday of mine and pretending it's Jewish Christmas.

102
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:13,550
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not Jewish Christmas.

103
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:16,491
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Hanukkah.

104
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:19,152
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's also

105
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:32,008
[SPEAKER_02]: it's it's essentially it's denying my identity not affirming my identity by subsuming it into a Christmas display.

106
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:47,902
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, as it is at least trying in in a not very meaningful way to include Jewish and African American culture there, who is it excluded.

107
00:12:49,898 --> 00:12:55,503
[SPEAKER_02]: What about the large numbers of Asian Americans from China, from Bangladesh, from India?

108
00:12:56,324 --> 00:12:59,586
[SPEAKER_02]: How do they fit into this extravaganza?

109
00:13:01,328 --> 00:13:03,109
[SPEAKER_02]: And the answer is they don't.

110
00:13:04,571 --> 00:13:06,853
[SPEAKER_02]: They were not even included as tokens.

111
00:13:08,234 --> 00:13:15,520
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think that if you want to have a Christmas display, you have a Christmas display.

112
00:13:16,694 --> 00:13:25,276
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you want to include other people, then you start inviting the community to have their own displays.

113
00:13:25,296 --> 00:13:29,358
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, five days from today as we're recording is the Lunar New Year.

114
00:13:30,298 --> 00:13:32,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Is anything happening for the Lunar New Year?

115
00:13:34,099 --> 00:13:34,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that I've heard of.

116
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:45,422
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder, David, what was your reaction to the concert display?

117
00:13:46,977 --> 00:13:53,259
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I have to tell you, as you speak, this becomes, for me, a very sensitive issue.

118
00:13:55,460 --> 00:14:02,102
[SPEAKER_01]: Just so you know, I grew up in a Unitarian family.

119
00:14:02,162 --> 00:14:04,203
[SPEAKER_01]: My grandfather was a religious humanist.

120
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:14,814
[SPEAKER_01]: I tell you, one of the most formative experiences of my whole life was when I was in third grade.

121
00:14:16,735 --> 00:14:21,558
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to have this set of books in our house called the Encyclopedia of Natural History.

122
00:14:23,018 --> 00:14:30,503
[SPEAKER_01]: And my sister was in the fifth grade and she wrote a paper on the Scopes monkey trial.

123
00:14:32,592 --> 00:14:35,456
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was in California, right outside of Los Angeles.

124
00:14:35,496 --> 00:14:38,579
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the teachers in the school were from the Church of Nazarene.

125
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:46,047
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that time, we're talking the late 1950s, they still have religious education in school.

126
00:14:47,729 --> 00:14:51,373
[SPEAKER_01]: And what that meant was that one hour a day, one hour a week,

127
00:14:55,053 --> 00:14:57,895
[SPEAKER_01]: kids were released to religious education.

128
00:14:58,915 --> 00:15:08,260
[SPEAKER_01]: Some kids went to Catholic school, some went to Protestant, and there were a lot of Japanese Americans there, and they had their own little place.

129
00:15:09,821 --> 00:15:12,742
[SPEAKER_01]: My mother said, you all aren't going anywhere, right?

130
00:15:13,382 --> 00:15:22,927
[SPEAKER_01]: And we sat in the room, and my sister wrote this paper on a Scopes monkey trial, and the kids,

131
00:15:24,278 --> 00:15:25,098
[SPEAKER_01]: got wind of it.

132
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:33,342
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the time I came back into my class, the kids were jumping around on their desks like monkeys, yelling at me, saying, oh, you think we came from monkeys?

133
00:15:33,382 --> 00:15:35,122
[SPEAKER_01]: And a teacher stood there and didn't do anything.

134
00:15:36,723 --> 00:15:40,164
[SPEAKER_01]: And it got so bad at a school that we had to be withdrawn from that school.

135
00:15:40,424 --> 00:15:41,185
[SPEAKER_01]: We were harassed.

136
00:15:42,045 --> 00:15:48,888
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say that because, to me, a Christmas display does not belong at City Hall, period.

137
00:15:50,468 --> 00:15:54,831
[SPEAKER_01]: And this goes back to my comment about the great lie.

138
00:15:55,872 --> 00:16:02,516
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a constitution that guarantees a separation of church and state.

139
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:08,160
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are we having a conversation about any kind of religious observation at City Hall?

140
00:16:09,641 --> 00:16:09,961
[SPEAKER_01]: It's wrong.

141
00:16:11,649 --> 00:16:13,270
[SPEAKER_01]: So Barry, I'm sorry.

142
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,651
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't think that all the tokenism.

143
00:16:16,031 --> 00:16:22,655
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think if you brought every faith you could imagine, which you couldn't do, because some people don't profess to any faith.

144
00:16:22,675 --> 00:16:27,357
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, I think part of the problem is our very notion

145
00:16:34,075 --> 00:16:42,257
[SPEAKER_01]: and understanding and acceptance of what the actual power and miracle of our sacred documents, that constitution is.

146
00:16:43,017 --> 00:16:46,577
[SPEAKER_01]: We violate it constantly without thinking.

147
00:16:48,498 --> 00:16:56,379
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, to me, that's what freaked me out about this.

148
00:16:58,299 --> 00:17:00,980
[SPEAKER_01]: Not, you know, I mean, why a menorah, why anything?

149
00:17:02,577 --> 00:17:05,239
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's supposed to be a safe place.

150
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:15,184
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is the definition of tokenism to say, okay, well, we'll make sure there's a little bit for everybody.

151
00:17:17,945 --> 00:17:20,687
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's something wrong with that.

152
00:17:21,303 --> 00:17:36,079
[SPEAKER_03]: I think your point about City Hall being a safe place like maybe that's a like a transition to think about inclusivity more broadly or exclusivity or it sounds like you know you're bringing up these great points about our Constitution being made by like you know it's like.

153
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:50,789
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, highlighting the powers of like race, wealth, religion, and how those there is a dominant, there's like, there are like dominant pieces of that that are, you know, that's what we're sort of up against when we think about inclusivity and being inclusive.

154
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:55,433
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think there's lots of other things to point to at City Hall, where this is happening, right?

155
00:17:55,473 --> 00:18:01,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we have a city council and a school committee that are like, mostly white, most, I mean, city council, mostly male.

156
00:18:02,377 --> 00:18:06,000
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think there's been reflections on what does it feel like to be a non

157
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:10,463
[SPEAKER_03]: cis white person going to City Hall or interacting with City Hall.

158
00:18:11,104 --> 00:18:14,447
[SPEAKER_03]: And Barry, I see you have some comments here, so I'll go to you.

159
00:18:16,168 --> 00:18:17,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I want to tell a story.

160
00:18:17,489 --> 00:18:20,451
[SPEAKER_02]: But first of all, I want to thank David for that.

161
00:18:21,512 --> 00:18:22,753
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave a misimpression.

162
00:18:22,773 --> 00:18:33,362
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I don't think any religious display has any place in any publicly owned place.

163
00:18:39,241 --> 00:18:42,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I misspoke on that one, but let me tell the story.

164
00:18:42,724 --> 00:18:52,332
[SPEAKER_02]: This was about three and a half years ago before the first OR folks were elected to city council.

165
00:18:52,913 --> 00:19:04,143
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a city council that was all Catholic, all white, and either six or seven of the seven were Italian.

166
00:19:05,053 --> 00:19:13,979
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so you've got a demographic that's really 20% of the city owning the whole thing.

167
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:18,242
[SPEAKER_02]: But what's relevant here is that they were all Catholic.

168
00:19:18,703 --> 00:19:30,351
[SPEAKER_02]: So at the beginning of the event, there was, as often, there was a recognition of somebody who had passed away in the community.

169
00:19:32,268 --> 00:19:35,629
[SPEAKER_02]: and condolences being resolved by the city council.

170
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:48,772
[SPEAKER_02]: And I watched from the audience as all seven city councilors stood up and did the sign of the cross.

171
00:19:50,653 --> 00:19:56,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, how do you know how do I, as

172
00:19:59,252 --> 00:20:05,055
[SPEAKER_02]: a Jew and as an atheist, and I won't go into how I managed to reconcile those.

173
00:20:06,576 --> 00:20:11,099
[SPEAKER_02]: But how do I, from the audience, deal with this?

174
00:20:11,639 --> 00:20:15,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, for a moment, am I in City Hall or am I in church?

175
00:20:17,602 --> 00:20:23,606
[SPEAKER_02]: For one or two members to do that as an act of their personal faith,

176
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:31,014
[SPEAKER_02]: reflexive act of their personal faith is like, okay, you know, that's, that's cool.

177
00:20:31,574 --> 00:20:45,204
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you see seven out of seven doing it, even though it wasn't planned, it becomes a display that it represents the city.

178
00:20:46,986 --> 00:20:54,351
[SPEAKER_02]: And that that that city does not include me, does not include David, does not include

179
00:20:55,412 --> 00:21:04,599
[SPEAKER_02]: anybody from the ICC does not include the many Hindus that are living in, you know, does not include the city.

180
00:21:07,662 --> 00:21:13,086
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is the sort of thing that I have experienced happening here for 35 years.

181
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,152
[SPEAKER_02]: It happened again at the inauguration.

182
00:21:21,152 --> 00:21:21,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, by the way.

183
00:21:22,425 --> 00:21:47,452
[SPEAKER_02]: where there was and again I think this was an attempt to be inclusive they invited an African immigrant pastor who's evangelical to give the closing blessing and he started his benediction with in the name of Jesus and repeated that at least three and maybe four times over the course of his benediction

184
00:21:51,371 --> 00:21:56,475
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't necessarily fault him because I don't know how long he's been here.

185
00:21:56,495 --> 00:22:05,122
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know to what degree he's assimilated and acculturated and understands that that is not appropriate at a civic ceremony.

186
00:22:07,404 --> 00:22:14,190
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to fault the administration for inviting him and not giving him a heads up about how you do this sort of thing.

187
00:22:18,354 --> 00:22:28,663
[SPEAKER_01]: No, Barry, it's interesting because those, you know, your comments raise this question about, you know, we should, we can, you know, about, about the public square.

188
00:22:28,863 --> 00:22:38,971
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, kind of who, you know, there's this idea, you know, what I started to say is who owns the public square, but then that's, that's, that's a crazy notion to begin with, too, isn't it?

189
00:22:39,131 --> 00:22:39,291
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?

190
00:22:40,668 --> 00:22:57,044
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, it's kind of like, you know, when we bought our house, you know, my wife, I joke, my wife jokes with me, we bought this house, you know, like it was a lifelong dream, you know, and, you know, I knew, my mother and father never owned a house, right?

191
00:22:58,025 --> 00:22:59,167
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said to her, I said, you know, well,

192
00:23:01,155 --> 00:23:03,536
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we can, we'll never own the land.

193
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:10,641
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, you know, so we have the house, but you know, the land isn't ours.

194
00:23:12,582 --> 00:23:14,883
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, and I meant it.

195
00:23:15,003 --> 00:23:16,924
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, and it's not hard for me to reconcile.

196
00:23:16,944 --> 00:23:18,885
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not hard for me to understand that I don't own this land.

197
00:23:20,867 --> 00:23:24,789
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the language we have in this idea that we own the public square.

198
00:23:24,809 --> 00:23:29,712
[SPEAKER_01]: And that means it's for me, it's not for you.

199
00:23:31,088 --> 00:23:34,750
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole notion of ownership, right?

200
00:23:35,851 --> 00:23:45,016
[SPEAKER_01]: But having kind of acknowledged my misstep in thinking there about who owns the public square, the question is kind of in a way, what is the public square, right?

201
00:23:45,036 --> 00:23:48,218
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we think about it differently, right?

202
00:23:48,739 --> 00:23:49,679
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we think about,

203
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:57,926
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the verb we use if it's not own it?

204
00:23:57,946 --> 00:23:58,648
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we honor it?

205
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,201
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, is probably more appropriate.

206
00:24:10,381 --> 00:24:27,191
[SPEAKER_01]: And we honor it, you know, by recognizing and acknowledging, you know, this terrible, terrible term, diversity, by recognizing and acknowledging that what makes the public square a public square is all of this difference.

207
00:24:29,373 --> 00:24:42,505
[SPEAKER_01]: That needs to be recognized, you know, you don't say I'm not Black, and appreciated and welcomed and shared.

208
00:24:44,322 --> 00:24:47,785
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, our notions are of ownership, right?

209
00:24:48,586 --> 00:24:49,967
[SPEAKER_01]: And Barry, you know, it's true.

210
00:24:50,027 --> 00:24:53,150
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't know how, you know, it's an interesting thing for us to think.

211
00:24:54,270 --> 00:25:01,857
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's all this stuff about triggering and I, you know, and it's very difficult and complicated stuff and I'm not sure where I come out on it.

212
00:25:02,658 --> 00:25:10,985
[SPEAKER_01]: But I will say, it's very hard for people to understand the kind of pain that can be experienced

213
00:25:13,349 --> 00:25:15,810
[SPEAKER_01]: by what you just described, Perry, right?

214
00:25:16,671 --> 00:25:25,076
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you become invisible, right?

215
00:25:25,716 --> 00:25:30,659
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not part of that event, right?

216
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:34,062
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially the city council and that one in particular.

217
00:25:34,922 --> 00:25:36,243
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's also true.

218
00:25:36,283 --> 00:25:38,965
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time I go to an event and I hear that in Jesus' name,

219
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,081
[SPEAKER_01]: And nobody thinks about that.

220
00:25:43,101 --> 00:25:55,166
[SPEAKER_01]: And we all misspeak, we all are insensitive to others, but we have to be willing to kind of reflect on that and look at that as a city.

221
00:25:56,539 --> 00:26:10,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we started recording, I think we were talking a little bit about this scarcity thing, where if somebody else is going to get something, if we're going to include somebody, then I'm going to lose something.

222
00:26:10,743 --> 00:26:14,324
[SPEAKER_03]: The imagery of City Hall, I think, helps me think about that too.

223
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:19,246
[SPEAKER_03]: There was this tiny little piece for these two groups, and then the whole City Hall for one group.

224
00:26:19,846 --> 00:26:46,911
[SPEAKER_03]: like what that and I guess like how how that plays out on a city level and you're saying like you know these folks that were like representing in us in the city government only made up a small piece of the people that actually lived here and so and I wonder like thinking about I think all these things all the history is really important like the recent history the the far past history like how we like use that as we move forward and like sort of what your what your hopes are for the city to take away from some of these things.

225
00:26:53,619 --> 00:27:04,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, well, um, I mean, through, I'm involved, as I said, in a number of local groups, one of them being safe Medford.

226
00:27:05,943 --> 00:27:23,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and we've been meeting with the mayor and, um, trying to get her to, um, engage in a, in a, a deeper and more meaningful way with, um, with the broader demographic of the city.

227
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:31,889
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it remains to be seen what will actually happen there.

228
00:27:33,429 --> 00:27:42,531
[SPEAKER_02]: She is listening, but listening and follow through are not necessarily the same thing.

229
00:27:44,752 --> 00:27:47,953
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we think is needed is

230
00:27:49,576 --> 00:27:54,879
[SPEAKER_02]: for the administration to stop thinking about outreach and start thinking about reaching in.

231
00:27:57,081 --> 00:28:11,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Reaching into the community and taking the time and putting in the effort, because as a former community organizer, this isn't easy stuff.

232
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:16,893
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a major commitment of resources to build connections where you don't have them.

233
00:28:18,349 --> 00:28:22,292
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, but she's got to do it.

234
00:28:23,432 --> 00:28:26,414
[SPEAKER_02]: She's got to build connections in the Haitian community.

235
00:28:26,474 --> 00:28:29,456
[SPEAKER_02]: She's got to build connections in the Brazilian community.

236
00:28:30,397 --> 00:28:42,704
[SPEAKER_02]: There are large segments of the population in Medford that are completely disengaged from civic and political life, and they need to be engaged.

237
00:28:45,261 --> 00:28:47,742
[SPEAKER_02]: So those connections need to be meaningful.

238
00:28:47,782 --> 00:28:49,003
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to be durable.

239
00:28:50,144 --> 00:29:02,450
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think a part of what has to happen is that not only the mayor, but she and the key members of her administration need to look at who's on the speed dial of their cell phones.

240
00:29:05,232 --> 00:29:07,693
[SPEAKER_02]: And they need to revamp that speed dial.

241
00:29:07,813 --> 00:29:09,454
[SPEAKER_02]: It needs to include people like David.

242
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:13,601
[SPEAKER_02]: It needs to include people like Kiera Singleton.

243
00:29:13,661 --> 00:29:16,924
[SPEAKER_02]: It needs to include people like the director of the ICC.

244
00:29:17,024 --> 00:29:23,810
[SPEAKER_02]: It needs to include the people from the Chinese business community along Riverside Drive.

245
00:29:24,351 --> 00:29:31,597
[SPEAKER_02]: It needs to include people other than the old guard that has dominated the politics of the city forever.

246
00:29:34,578 --> 00:29:35,659
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, I agree with that.

247
00:29:35,719 --> 00:29:37,581
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go even further, Barry.

248
00:29:37,621 --> 00:29:40,043
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go to your organizing experience.

249
00:29:40,103 --> 00:29:48,470
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to say, you said, you used a key phrase, I think, and I'm so appreciative.

250
00:29:48,891 --> 00:29:51,313
[SPEAKER_01]: You said they're disengaged, right?

251
00:29:51,473 --> 00:29:57,659
[SPEAKER_01]: And to me, engagement is the opposite of outreach.

252
00:29:59,446 --> 00:30:15,353
[SPEAKER_01]: Outreach is this, you know, engagement is an interactive process, right, in which you come to understand that the people you once characterized as voiceless have a lot to say.

253
00:30:15,873 --> 00:30:16,873
[SPEAKER_01]: They aren't voiceless.

254
00:30:16,954 --> 00:30:20,795
[SPEAKER_01]: Their voices have been excluded or muted, right?

255
00:30:21,235 --> 00:30:27,498
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, also before the call, we were talking about this whole idea of seats at the table.

256
00:30:29,462 --> 00:30:33,563
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, and I was saying, you know, we need to get rid of the table, the whole idea.

257
00:30:34,423 --> 00:30:43,606
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need to get rid of the idea of City Hall as this castle with a moat around it, right?

258
00:30:43,766 --> 00:30:45,286
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is the way people, a lot of people see it.

259
00:30:45,706 --> 00:30:54,509
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I might go get a parking stick or something there, but it's still, it has that, you know, and the point is that, you know, and it's interesting because, you know,

260
00:30:55,509 --> 00:31:03,092
[SPEAKER_01]: If you watch the news lately and you watch Mayor Wu and the way she moves through the city, right?

261
00:31:03,212 --> 00:31:05,272
[SPEAKER_01]: On the subway, right?

262
00:31:06,873 --> 00:31:14,375
[SPEAKER_01]: The city needs to be out there, right?

263
00:31:15,896 --> 00:31:23,018
[SPEAKER_01]: The table, as it were, you need to get up from the table and get into the city.

264
00:31:25,875 --> 00:31:40,538
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, you know, and because, you know, I, you know, I, first of all, Barry, I don't want them calling me, but second of all, I think there are other people who should be talking to them.

265
00:31:42,619 --> 00:31:48,140
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have to, you know, and they have to do the work to know and understand who they are.

266
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:48,840
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not me.

267
00:31:50,574 --> 00:31:52,695
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?

268
00:31:53,676 --> 00:31:56,438
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of part of the problem.

269
00:31:56,798 --> 00:31:58,599
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the typical thing that they would do.

270
00:31:58,859 --> 00:31:59,840
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, let's get David Harris.

271
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,781
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a black guy.

272
00:32:00,801 --> 00:32:03,102
[SPEAKER_01]: He knows.

273
00:32:03,122 --> 00:32:03,162
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

274
00:32:03,522 --> 00:32:07,625
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to understand what community organizers understand.

275
00:32:07,965 --> 00:32:13,329
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is that it's the people on the street who have the knowledge.

276
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:28,613
[SPEAKER_01]: and the understanding of what's going on in their lives and how government can and should be not serving them, but should be partnering with them.

277
00:32:28,853 --> 00:32:33,514
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, it's all in the language, this idea of serving the people.

278
00:32:36,274 --> 00:32:37,235
[SPEAKER_01]: Whose government is it?

279
00:32:39,435 --> 00:32:44,657
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to make that, you have to make that real through action, right?

280
00:32:48,859 --> 00:32:56,022
[SPEAKER_03]: I think speaking of like the history there, oh sorry, like I've heard from folks like, I think there has been

281
00:32:57,366 --> 00:33:18,282
[SPEAKER_03]: like harm done to some of these communities by city hall right so like when you're when we're sitting when the messages like come to us like if you have a you know we were here to hear what you need right like Dr. Divya nod stare destroy with me about how like she tried to do that and was very much like the experience totally shut her off and totally shut her daughter off right and so like I do like appreciate that perspective of engagement.

282
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:19,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry Barry.

283
00:33:19,904 --> 00:33:22,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, I think that.

284
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:31,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's the point that I was also making about the difference between outreach and in-reach.

285
00:33:31,317 --> 00:33:40,443
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a figure ground thing, like which is the reality and which is the second to the reality.

286
00:33:42,725 --> 00:33:51,911
[SPEAKER_02]: And we actually described to the mayor a process for doing outreach

287
00:33:53,697 --> 00:33:55,657
[SPEAKER_02]: doing this in a meaningful way.

288
00:33:55,737 --> 00:34:12,341
[SPEAKER_02]: There's several of us who were professional community organizers said, first, you start with what you know, you know, you start with the known leaders in the community, because that's what you know.

289
00:34:12,781 --> 00:34:20,643
[SPEAKER_02]: So you go to David Harris's, you go to the pastors of the churches, you go to the business leaders, and

290
00:34:21,578 --> 00:34:25,903
[SPEAKER_02]: you're looking to fill seats on committees and commissions, you do not ask them.

291
00:34:27,785 --> 00:34:28,826
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't ask them.

292
00:34:29,286 --> 00:34:32,369
[SPEAKER_02]: You ask them, where do people congregate?

293
00:34:33,731 --> 00:34:37,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Who are leaders that I don't know about?

294
00:34:38,396 --> 00:34:40,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Who are the people that people listen to?

295
00:34:42,961 --> 00:34:44,182
[SPEAKER_02]: And you start getting names.

296
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:49,992
[SPEAKER_02]: And you don't necessarily invite the second tier of names either.

297
00:34:50,472 --> 00:34:58,055
[SPEAKER_02]: You keep talking and getting ideas and finding, getting the names of more people.

298
00:34:58,495 --> 00:35:09,620
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at some point you come across people who you know can speak well for the community that they live in and who will do a good job.

299
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,261
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when you start inviting people.

300
00:35:15,048 --> 00:35:15,548
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's right.

301
00:35:15,688 --> 00:35:15,988
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

302
00:35:16,148 --> 00:35:16,408
[SPEAKER_01]: I see.

303
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:16,869
[SPEAKER_01]: I told you.

304
00:35:16,909 --> 00:35:18,929
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, you know, you organize it.

305
00:35:19,169 --> 00:35:19,489
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

306
00:35:19,589 --> 00:35:20,129
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's true.

307
00:35:20,149 --> 00:35:20,429
[SPEAKER_01]: You're right.

308
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:24,191
[SPEAKER_01]: I know they can call me, but I'm going to I'm going to send them elsewhere.

309
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:26,491
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the point.

310
00:35:28,152 --> 00:35:28,672
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're right.

311
00:35:28,712 --> 00:35:29,692
[SPEAKER_01]: So because they don't know.

312
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:31,593
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, and no, no, that's an interesting.

313
00:35:31,633 --> 00:35:32,733
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really important thing.

314
00:35:34,835 --> 00:35:37,096
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is important for them to understand that.

315
00:35:37,256 --> 00:35:41,118
[SPEAKER_01]: They're lucky that they have you kind of advising them.

316
00:35:41,158 --> 00:35:42,618
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the question is whether they'll do it.

317
00:35:48,081 --> 00:35:51,463
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's so, you know, look, I will say this, you know,

318
00:35:53,257 --> 00:35:59,985
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a soon-to-be 22-year-old who's only ever lived in this house.

319
00:36:00,185 --> 00:36:05,211
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he's in college now, but when I was a kid, I never lived in the same place more than two years in a row.

320
00:36:05,231 --> 00:36:07,754
[SPEAKER_01]: And he loves West Medford.

321
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:14,030
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

322
00:36:14,911 --> 00:36:26,396
[SPEAKER_01]: And he and his friends, you know, they've all they've all scattered to different places and some of them are still here, but they are so tight and they have such a feeling for this neighborhood.

323
00:36:28,117 --> 00:36:30,118
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he's Kevin he goes and says where it's from.

324
00:36:30,138 --> 00:36:33,979
[SPEAKER_01]: He says it's from West Medford, but But the point is

325
00:36:37,951 --> 00:36:44,216
[SPEAKER_01]: You know there's there are ways in which Medford is a special place right and I in West Medford is certainly a special place but.

326
00:36:46,197 --> 00:36:53,383
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there are things about Medford that that could be that it could be a great city.

327
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:55,284
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

328
00:36:56,696 --> 00:37:13,182
[SPEAKER_01]: There are people, there are these old Italian families here, and they are rich in history and culture, right?

329
00:37:13,742 --> 00:37:16,503
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much to share, right?

330
00:37:17,263 --> 00:37:20,124
[SPEAKER_01]: When you think about, and there has to be a way

331
00:37:25,406 --> 00:37:34,212
[SPEAKER_01]: for this, and the government in a way, it can and should be the facilitator of that greatness.

332
00:37:36,854 --> 00:37:40,136
[SPEAKER_01]: But it has to, it takes learning on their part.

333
00:37:40,156 --> 00:37:48,662
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not, there are things that aren't natural to people who are in City Hall that they need help on, but they're, you know,

334
00:37:49,842 --> 00:38:00,106
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I'm sorry I'm preaching but I, the point that the point I want to make is I think that I do think that metric could be, you know, you know, a special city right when we bought this house.

335
00:38:00,766 --> 00:38:01,866
[SPEAKER_01]: We had friends who said.

336
00:38:05,007 --> 00:38:09,632
[SPEAKER_01]: And we bought it very specifically because West Medford had such a vibrant black community.

337
00:38:11,154 --> 00:38:15,879
[SPEAKER_01]: But as members of the so-called professional class, people say, oh, you should just move to Arlington.

338
00:38:18,662 --> 00:38:19,162
[SPEAKER_01]: Better schools.

339
00:38:19,242 --> 00:38:22,986
[SPEAKER_01]: And my point is, no, no.

340
00:38:23,527 --> 00:38:25,389
[SPEAKER_01]: Medford is much better than Arlington.

341
00:38:26,448 --> 00:38:29,551
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do have some pride in the city, right?

342
00:38:30,873 --> 00:38:33,155
[SPEAKER_01]: And its potential and its possibility.

343
00:38:35,518 --> 00:38:39,843
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are things that we need to reckon with here, just like the rest of the country.

344
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:48,104
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of that is not, is getting beyond, you know, so again, you know, Siberia, you'll know this is true.

345
00:38:48,344 --> 00:39:05,961
[SPEAKER_01]: So, because what they'll, when they think about diversity, they think about, they'll come to West Medford, they'll get some of those black middle-class families from Medford, you know, kind of to represent, you know, but there's so much more elsewhere in the city, right?

346
00:39:08,638 --> 00:39:11,799
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's this tendency to take the easy way, right?

347
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,761
[SPEAKER_01]: The way that you know, right?

348
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:16,921
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the way.

349
00:39:16,981 --> 00:39:17,741
[SPEAKER_02]: And the menorah.

350
00:39:18,182 --> 00:39:21,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

351
00:39:25,624 --> 00:39:26,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for that.

352
00:39:27,925 --> 00:39:29,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Freddie, would you add anything to what David shared?

353
00:39:33,452 --> 00:39:37,414
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think I've played out.

354
00:39:37,874 --> 00:39:41,916
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've been here longer than I have, you know, so, you know, so I'm curious.

355
00:39:41,936 --> 00:39:46,377
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, do you have a I mean, I mean, obviously, you haven't left, right?

356
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:48,058
[SPEAKER_02]: So I haven't left.

357
00:39:48,218 --> 00:39:52,700
[SPEAKER_02]: It's I mean, I, I moved to West Medford in 1987.

358
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,540
[SPEAKER_02]: And I bought

359
00:39:59,717 --> 00:40:05,061
[SPEAKER_02]: the house that I'm living in in North Medford in 1982, in 1992.

360
00:40:06,442 --> 00:40:14,348
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the least expensive house on the market in Medford at that time.

361
00:40:15,008 --> 00:40:17,049
[SPEAKER_02]: It was quite a fixer-upper.

362
00:40:17,069 --> 00:40:17,130
[SPEAKER_02]: And

363
00:40:22,025 --> 00:40:28,872
[SPEAKER_02]: people would ask me about my neighborhood, you know, thinking Cambridge Port in the 1990s.

364
00:40:28,933 --> 00:40:35,159
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it's still diverse, but Cambridge Port in the 1990s, you know, is it, you know, is your community diverse?

365
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,543
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd say, I am the diverse.

366
00:40:43,385 --> 00:40:45,507
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's no longer true.

367
00:40:46,969 --> 00:40:52,134
[SPEAKER_02]: This neighborhood is becoming diverse, very diverse.

368
00:40:52,395 --> 00:41:03,006
[SPEAKER_02]: I see people of all different ethnicities and races walking around, as I often do.

369
00:41:05,703 --> 00:41:07,383
[SPEAKER_02]: It feels really, really nice.

370
00:41:08,984 --> 00:41:22,728
[SPEAKER_02]: I also want to say in 2014, during the Ferguson uprisings, I put a kind of a makeshift Black Lives Matter sign out on my front window.

371
00:41:24,348 --> 00:41:27,629
[SPEAKER_02]: And within a week, I had a rock thrown through my window.

372
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:32,150
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did the only two reasonable things.

373
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:34,071
[SPEAKER_02]: One was I reported it to the police.

374
00:41:35,421 --> 00:41:37,842
[SPEAKER_02]: and the other was I put up more signs.

375
00:41:40,163 --> 00:41:46,826
[SPEAKER_02]: But now there's Black Lives Matter signs all over the place in my neighborhood.

376
00:41:47,346 --> 00:41:55,010
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, so I see a change happening, and I'm welcoming the change.

377
00:41:57,088 --> 00:42:07,819
[SPEAKER_02]: City Hall is just in the first stages of beginning to reflect the changes that have been happening in the community for decades.

378
00:42:08,919 --> 00:42:22,026
[SPEAKER_03]: I think too, like, so I grew up in a town that borders Arlington, but, and I do, I did have friends that had lived in Medford and it was, I think like eighties and nineties, it felt like that was a place where like their family started out until they can move somewhere else.

379
00:42:22,126 --> 00:42:24,708
[SPEAKER_03]: And they like take advantage of a different school system.

380
00:42:25,008 --> 00:42:33,853
[SPEAKER_03]: It does feel like, I don't know, like my history here isn't that long, but like there's a shift in like, this is a place that people want to stay and want to live and want to raise their families.

381
00:42:34,413 --> 00:42:35,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and.

382
00:42:36,014 --> 00:42:38,715
[SPEAKER_03]: perhaps it's been like that longer than I've known it to be that.

383
00:42:38,775 --> 00:42:49,559
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that that does speak to like what you're saying, David, about like, how does the government sort of uplift the community rather than like dictate, you know, rather than sort of decide for it.

384
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:57,442
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think there's like interesting things, like from what I've heard about like happening around like zoning and charter review that could have some impact on that.

385
00:42:57,482 --> 00:43:02,444
[SPEAKER_03]: But I feel these are really thoughtful and, and interesting things to hear as well.

386
00:43:04,308 --> 00:43:05,329
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's going to be interesting.

387
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:12,032
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, I think, you know, there are clearly concerns about the future of West Medford.

388
00:43:12,092 --> 00:43:14,133
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, West Medford is looking quite different.

389
00:43:14,613 --> 00:43:17,815
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I think you're right.

390
00:43:17,855 --> 00:43:20,436
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was, it was a starter place, right?

391
00:43:20,476 --> 00:43:22,677
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what people, people would come here, they buy houses.

392
00:43:22,737 --> 00:43:26,519
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, when their kids got of age, they'd go to Winchester or wherever and then get out.

393
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:34,367
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think there are there are challenges ahead of us I mean I've heard rumors that they now want to bring the green line up here again.

394
00:43:34,387 --> 00:43:44,939
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, you know, and it's interesting because those some of those big macro issue that some issues like that.

395
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:51,485
[SPEAKER_01]: are really important to understand the dynamics.

396
00:43:51,706 --> 00:43:55,149
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, and kind of think about who wants to be in line up here.

397
00:43:56,810 --> 00:43:57,911
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the people who live here.

398
00:43:59,848 --> 00:44:09,916
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the people who live here and, you know, whose voice counts then, right?

399
00:44:10,136 --> 00:44:11,858
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we process that kind of thing?

400
00:44:13,659 --> 00:44:16,822
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, the zoning, I mean, there are interesting things on the horizon.

401
00:44:17,122 --> 00:44:19,764
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, and those processes have to include

402
00:44:24,259 --> 00:44:26,160
[SPEAKER_01]: the voices of everyone, you see.

403
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:28,782
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's an educational aspect of it.

404
00:44:28,822 --> 00:44:37,647
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a kind of communication aspect of it, of letting people know what's going on, what the issues are, and then being open to what they have to say.

405
00:44:37,667 --> 00:44:39,048
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's work.

406
00:44:39,068 --> 00:44:45,192
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the work that I fear our administrations aren't really accustomed to.

407
00:44:52,303 --> 00:45:10,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I did hear something recently about like the term of merit like the, it's just two years, and that like that, you know, I think that could have something to do with like this sense of urgency to get things done and that that ends up ends up probably does exclude lots of voices because they just, and you both shared a story before we started recording about the

408
00:45:11,701 --> 00:45:29,518
[SPEAKER_03]: choosing the last police chief or the current police chief and, and how and I think that speaks to the power that the mayor is given in in our charter and how, you know, maybe like perhaps looking at that or the, I think the hopes to look at that and change that to sort of distribute power a little bit more evenly could could also benefit the city as well.

409
00:45:30,259 --> 00:45:31,320
[SPEAKER_01]: And we should be thinking about it.

410
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:33,662
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think, you know, it's also the case that

411
00:45:37,790 --> 00:45:42,912
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the black candidates for city council can get about 4,000 votes, right?

412
00:45:45,453 --> 00:45:51,456
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and whichever one it is, you know, it's about 4,000 votes, and it's always just below the threshold.

413
00:45:51,956 --> 00:45:57,918
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, raises questions about districts, right?

414
00:45:58,719 --> 00:46:03,181
[SPEAKER_01]: Raises questions about how we organize the political structure of the city.

415
00:46:05,484 --> 00:46:08,605
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are things we should think about and have conversations about.

416
00:46:08,625 --> 00:46:19,588
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not saying that that's necessarily a solution, but if it happens time after time after time after time, then let's see.

417
00:46:19,768 --> 00:46:22,629
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe there are different ways we can organize things.

418
00:46:26,026 --> 00:46:28,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, talking about like war representation where.

419
00:46:28,928 --> 00:46:30,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.

420
00:46:33,171 --> 00:46:38,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think board representation is important, I wonder if.

421
00:46:38,294 --> 00:46:40,936
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, one thing.

422
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:53,953
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure that our city is as segregated as other cities where moving toward representation did improve.

423
00:46:54,193 --> 00:46:57,074
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's what I'm saying.

424
00:46:57,094 --> 00:46:58,214
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a matter, it's a question.

425
00:46:59,235 --> 00:47:00,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Something we have to talk about.

426
00:47:01,135 --> 00:47:01,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

427
00:47:02,216 --> 00:47:08,459
[SPEAKER_02]: But what it would improve is it would lower the threshold for people trying to enter races.

428
00:47:08,779 --> 00:47:12,782
[SPEAKER_02]: And I still think it would be valuable, even if it didn't accomplish that goal.

429
00:47:14,062 --> 00:47:27,550
[SPEAKER_02]: I also think that mayoral terms should be four years that they're constantly running for office, and they don't have any ability to do

430
00:47:28,868 --> 00:47:32,749
[SPEAKER_02]: planning that they can count on coming to fruition.

431
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:56,275
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that at the same time as that would give the mayor even more power, that there needs to be a redistribution of power from the mayor to the city council, that the long-term dysfunction of city government, where no matter who is the mayor and no matter who's on the city council, in my 35 years here,

432
00:47:58,128 --> 00:48:00,350
[SPEAKER_02]: City Council and the mayor have been at war.

433
00:48:02,311 --> 00:48:18,483
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that that comes, at least in part, from the fact that the City Council has so little power that the best it can do is to make noise and be obstructionist.

434
00:48:19,363 --> 00:48:21,565
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like our current national government.

435
00:48:21,645 --> 00:48:21,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

436
00:48:22,445 --> 00:48:22,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

437
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:49,536
[SPEAKER_03]: What I do hear like you both saying though is like though certainly the city has its problems and in like on macro and micro level is that there I think there is like a real like richness to the city when it comes to like interpersonal relationships and the individuals that make up the city.

438
00:48:49,556 --> 00:48:59,683
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's something that I've learned a lot from doing this podcast but also even today like I think there have been like points in the conversation where somebody said something that other than a person was able to sort of like

439
00:49:00,183 --> 00:49:23,708
[SPEAKER_03]: amend or like point out and like I think that's a really good example right to be able to have those sort of like like humor humorous or like humble conversations with each other about these things that really matter and I think sometimes when it comes to politics like the ego pieces get get in the way but I do really appreciate both of your reflections and and I I certainly learned a lot from hearing from both of you.

440
00:49:24,708 --> 00:49:29,349
[SPEAKER_02]: You know if you interview retirees they're people who have largely let go of ego

441
00:49:32,731 --> 00:49:33,392
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care.

442
00:49:33,572 --> 00:49:34,253
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

443
00:49:34,393 --> 00:49:40,498
[SPEAKER_01]: And nobody's going to fire you or anything.

444
00:49:40,558 --> 00:49:40,758
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

445
00:49:41,178 --> 00:49:41,518
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

446
00:49:41,559 --> 00:49:42,719
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

447
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,241
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's true.

448
00:49:44,541 --> 00:49:46,082
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one thing old folks are good for.

449
00:49:50,786 --> 00:49:59,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I wanted to see if there's anything that either of you want to add or mention, like things that maybe you're doing that we didn't touch on in this conversation that you wanted to plug or anything like that.

450
00:50:04,368 --> 00:50:04,969
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I mean,

451
00:50:06,581 --> 00:50:12,806
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I mean, I think I just would say, Daniel, there's so much going on in the city.

452
00:50:12,826 --> 00:50:32,441
[SPEAKER_01]: I really just encourage anybody who's watching this or paying attention to be part of this engagement, to find someone or some group who's doing stuff either in your neighborhood or another neighborhood and plug in.

453
00:50:34,663 --> 00:50:36,584
[SPEAKER_01]: and drive the engagement.

454
00:50:37,904 --> 00:50:46,147
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's going to be the real engine for moving us forward.

455
00:50:46,247 --> 00:50:48,828
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the nature.

456
00:50:48,868 --> 00:50:56,250
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how we the people comes to include all of us once we insert ourselves.

457
00:51:02,452 --> 00:51:04,113
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that as a closing statement.

458
00:51:08,643 --> 00:51:11,850
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you both so much, and hopefully we can touch base in the future.

459
00:51:11,870 --> 00:51:12,812
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be great.

460
00:51:12,933 --> 00:51:13,293
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.

461
00:51:13,394 --> 00:51:13,734
