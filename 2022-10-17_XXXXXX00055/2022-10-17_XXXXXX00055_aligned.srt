00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,561
Hey listeners, this is Danielle.

2
00:00:10,921 --> 00:00:11,422
And Shelley.

3
00:00:12,182 --> 00:00:14,824
Shelley is a radical Dravidian and racial equity activist.

4
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:17,866
And Danielle is a community mobilizer and change maker.

5
00:00:18,487 --> 00:00:20,208
And this is the Medford Bites podcast.

6
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:28,174
Every two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.

7
00:00:29,235 --> 00:00:32,277
Join us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford.

8
00:00:32,677 --> 00:00:34,759
And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:42,467 --> 00:00:46,328
All right, we're here at Extreme Ninja Studio with Ninja and Anna.

10
00:00:46,548 --> 00:00:49,709
So if you guys wouldn't mind just like introducing yourselves, just say who you are.

11
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:57,172
My name is Ninja and Mister, and I own a martial art gym quite with my wife.

12
00:00:57,552 --> 00:00:58,832
And yep, I'm Anna Nguyen.

13
00:00:58,993 --> 00:01:00,373
So we own the dojo together.

14
00:01:00,413 --> 00:01:01,813
It's Extreme Ninja Martial Arts.

15
00:01:01,894 --> 00:01:04,034
We also have a fitness program here as well.

16
00:01:04,294 --> 00:01:10,476
And our main focus, I think our main kind of purpose here is empowering youth and families to live their healthiest life.

17
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,372
Yeah, and we're going to get a lot into that and hear more about that.

18
00:01:16,552 --> 00:01:19,595
I do like how you just described the empowerment angle.

19
00:01:19,815 --> 00:01:22,457
That's something that Shelly and I kind of talked about wondering about.

20
00:01:22,658 --> 00:01:25,560
I always wonder about that with any kind of exercise or martial arts.

21
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:33,727
But before we get into that, we just want to ask you both the question that we ask everybody who comes on the podcast, which is your favorite place to eat in Medford.

22
00:01:34,248 --> 00:01:37,951
And if there's something that you particularly enjoy there, you could share that too.

23
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:43,336
For me, I really like Ebisuya, which is the Japanese market right down the street.

24
00:01:43,476 --> 00:01:45,398
They always have really cool, fun snacks.

25
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:46,660
My kids love that place.

26
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,823
And the sushi is just, I mean, it's very authentic.

27
00:01:49,963 --> 00:01:50,804
It's always fresh.

28
00:01:50,884 --> 00:01:51,925
It's always really good.

29
00:01:52,205 --> 00:01:55,789
Everybody there that works there is really friendly, very welcoming.

30
00:01:55,929 --> 00:01:56,610
I love that place.

31
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:00,579
And I think for me, same spot.

32
00:02:00,859 --> 00:02:05,540
If I was looking for sushi or like anything that to do with like food prep at home.

33
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,982
The other place that I know personally for me breakfast is the Lighthouse.

34
00:02:10,602 --> 00:02:13,463
You know, they're very friendly, you know, very friendly.

35
00:02:13,983 --> 00:02:15,825
They always know your name when they come in.

36
00:02:16,205 --> 00:02:17,686
So, you know, for me, that's big.

37
00:02:17,826 --> 00:02:21,649
And then the other part too is the Mexican place is the... Tenocht.

38
00:02:21,669 --> 00:02:22,270
Tenocht, yeah.

39
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:22,970
Yeah, they're very nice.

40
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:37,521
They're very nice, you know, so I, I like to interact with people who passion into what they do, you know, and I think the biggest thing for me is knowing and familiar with the people who's coming in to support you, you know, because I always believe that

41
00:02:38,562 --> 00:02:42,109
If without them, the business would not be here.

42
00:02:42,189 --> 00:02:45,615
So we have to, for myself anyway, to appreciate.

43
00:02:47,724 --> 00:02:54,269
And I can tell like Medford is definitely starting to have more and more places and kind of welcoming more into the community.

44
00:02:54,369 --> 00:03:00,495
So it's nice to see how things have changed over the years and how there's more options available now.

45
00:03:00,675 --> 00:03:02,496
I feel like there's a lot more to choose from now.

46
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:08,081
You kept it to your small radius of Medford Square, which is nice, very like hyperlocal.

47
00:03:08,101 --> 00:03:10,523
So it sounds like you guys spend a lot of time here in the square.

48
00:03:10,943 --> 00:03:11,143
Yeah.

49
00:03:11,183 --> 00:03:11,444
Yeah.

50
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:17,771
And I think what's nice too about Medford Square is like the community of business owners in this area are very supportive of each other.

51
00:03:17,911 --> 00:03:22,316
And, you know, we all kind of get to know each other and we see each other and we talk to each other.

52
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:24,258
So it's very supportive and nice.

53
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:30,065
And then the dinner, of course, the fun, the Italian place at Nomad Street start with an F.

54
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,821
Fjordaliers?

55
00:03:32,342 --> 00:03:32,902
Yes, that's it.

56
00:03:32,922 --> 00:03:33,723
Yeah, on Salem Street.

57
00:03:33,743 --> 00:03:35,465
Yeah, on Salem Street.

58
00:03:35,485 --> 00:03:36,365
I love that place.

59
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:40,049
But you can't bring a kid for sure.

60
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:44,093
We do a lot of takeout from there, like for after the kids are in bed.

61
00:03:46,213 --> 00:03:51,116
We also shouldn't forget we have a third guest here, which is Boba, who we might hear from.

62
00:03:51,296 --> 00:03:53,177
Boba is our dojo dog.

63
00:03:53,378 --> 00:03:58,461
So she's not here all the time, but she's here often and she's just kind of like our little mascot.

64
00:03:58,941 --> 00:04:01,262
So yeah, she's a, she's very, she's not a barker.

65
00:04:01,303 --> 00:04:04,244
She's pretty quiet, but she's a very friendly dog.

66
00:04:04,284 --> 00:04:12,189
She loves being around kids and she's always kind of checking everybody out and, and sometimes she'll go on the mat and show us a few moves.

67
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:16,912
She's usually very, it's like this playground for her.

68
00:04:17,152 --> 00:04:17,432
Yeah.

69
00:04:17,452 --> 00:04:20,453
So usually when we have people, we don't want her to jump up.

70
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:21,794
She's getting very excited.

71
00:04:21,834 --> 00:04:24,115
So we just like make sure she's roping it.

72
00:04:24,235 --> 00:04:26,596
But usually when people are not here, she runs everywhere.

73
00:04:26,716 --> 00:04:28,117
Yeah.

74
00:04:28,517 --> 00:04:29,337
She's part of the group.

75
00:04:29,618 --> 00:04:29,918
Yes.

76
00:04:30,018 --> 00:04:30,258
Yes.

77
00:04:31,078 --> 00:04:31,258
Yeah.

78
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:33,699
And the kids are like obsessed with her.

79
00:04:33,719 --> 00:04:34,620
They're all over her.

80
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,421
That would be a reason for me to come in the door.

81
00:04:37,521 --> 00:04:37,781
Yeah.

82
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:55,590
So I wonder if you might speak a little bit about your own like sort of personal connections to martial arts and maybe the story that comes before Extreme Ninja and then maybe the how and how that informs how this place came to be and even goes around.

83
00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:00,373
So I was, I started martial arts when I was four years old.

84
00:05:00,873 --> 00:05:01,154
Okay.

85
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:04,996
And in my culture in Vietnam, I was born Vietnamese and Thai.

86
00:05:05,537 --> 00:05:14,122
So what happened is back when I was growing up is the military, just like you turn 18 years old, they come and they take you.

87
00:05:14,603 --> 00:05:17,425
It's not like in America, you have your name on and all that.

88
00:05:18,165 --> 00:05:21,527
So we have in my family, we have 10 people in the family.

89
00:05:21,707 --> 00:05:23,808
We have more, but of course two pass away.

90
00:05:23,888 --> 00:05:28,390
So, you know, but we have a lot and we have five female and five male.

91
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:31,751
So what happened is my parents, they are fishermen.

92
00:05:32,571 --> 00:05:37,234
So what happened is when they come and take you, you know, you're mandatory, you have to go.

93
00:05:37,374 --> 00:05:40,235
So my dad smuggled all my brother here.

94
00:05:40,255 --> 00:05:40,295
So 1974.

95
00:05:43,056 --> 00:05:49,601
They smuggled over here and I was like a curious child, you know, like wake up in the morning, my brother not there.

96
00:05:50,702 --> 00:05:54,305
So because of that, my dad put me into martial arts just like distracts.

97
00:05:54,325 --> 00:05:58,148
So by the way, this kid doesn't ask too many questions, curious questions.

98
00:05:58,888 --> 00:06:01,891
So throughout that process, I learned martial arts.

99
00:06:02,491 --> 00:06:08,295
And then throughout that process, my dad actually got arrested because he smuggled everybody to the U.S.

100
00:06:08,315 --> 00:06:10,237
So he got arrested for two years.

101
00:06:10,357 --> 00:06:13,880
And then when we got out, he got out, he brought us over here in 1978.

102
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,984
And I was staying in a refugee camp from the Philippines and then Malaysia.

103
00:06:20,605 --> 00:06:21,485
So two camps.

104
00:06:21,785 --> 00:06:23,086
By the time we came to the U.S.

105
00:06:23,226 --> 00:06:23,987
it was 1980, December 1980.

106
00:06:24,027 --> 00:06:25,008
That was very cold at the time.

107
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:33,299
You know, so, but throughout that process, I went to school.

108
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:36,782
I wasn't like so great at school because the language barrier.

109
00:06:36,862 --> 00:06:40,805
I was just explaining to her like joking around was like back then was missing.

110
00:06:40,845 --> 00:06:46,549
Was it the neighborhood Roger, you know, ABC, you know, like that's how I learned English.

111
00:06:46,729 --> 00:06:47,990
And then I went to school.

112
00:06:48,931 --> 00:06:52,513
And then I moved back here 1986.

113
00:06:53,234 --> 00:06:59,377
I went to Medford High School, you know, and at that time was not a lot of Asian.

114
00:06:59,998 --> 00:07:06,342
It was like two and then maybe like four or five, maybe black, but the principal was a black lady.

115
00:07:07,162 --> 00:07:17,474
So it was, you know, it was a new environment, you know, growing up and I fell in love with the town, you know, so we live Spring Street and Salem Street, you know.

116
00:07:18,114 --> 00:07:20,977
And so because of that, I always trained martial art.

117
00:07:21,298 --> 00:07:26,444
I always, you know, and we, in my culture, martial art is not about a business.

118
00:07:26,964 --> 00:07:33,247
It's more like a healthy, you know, like you train, but it's not about like one day you open a business, you know.

119
00:07:33,747 --> 00:07:41,790
So it's a little bit different to see the environment because my parents expect me to like lawyer, doctor, you know, it's kind of typical, you know.

120
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:43,771
And so I went opposite way.

121
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:47,512
I fell in love with the health, you know, the lifestyle.

122
00:07:47,992 --> 00:07:51,834
I fell in love with it throughout my martial art.

123
00:07:52,094 --> 00:07:55,936
So 1987, I graduate high school, I opened my first martial art gym.

124
00:07:56,956 --> 00:08:04,461
And this was in Stoneham that used to be before LA Fitness was like the Desert Mall down there before.

125
00:08:05,162 --> 00:08:15,769
And then 1991, I closed the gym because at that time I was competing and teaching same time.

126
00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:20,992
What I mean is that I would teach my student to get better and then I would

127
00:08:22,053 --> 00:08:27,496
in some way kind of like take advantage on the students, so by that way, I can get better, you know.

128
00:08:27,976 --> 00:08:30,998
So my dad asked me, he said, you know, you have a choice.

129
00:08:31,318 --> 00:08:34,160
You can be a teacher or a student.

130
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:39,102
You can't be both because martial art is about integrity with who you are.

131
00:08:39,923 --> 00:08:42,364
So 1991, I closed the school.

132
00:08:42,964 --> 00:08:47,607
When I closed the school, I ended up working, I don't know if you know this place, Avalor.

133
00:08:49,248 --> 00:08:50,149
Good night club.

134
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:52,151
Yeah.

135
00:08:52,191 --> 00:08:58,256
So I was running, I work over there and then I become a manager and run security over there.

136
00:08:58,556 --> 00:09:02,779
So I did that 21 years, you know, so.

137
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:12,446
And I love it because, you know, you want to make sure like people are not, you know, get drunk, leave, or fight, stuff like that.

138
00:09:12,506 --> 00:09:15,128
So I'm really love observing people.

139
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:18,010
And I love caring for people.

140
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:22,393
Just simply the fact is that, you know, they're in the environment, not safe for them.

141
00:09:22,433 --> 00:09:28,817
So I did that for a while and then she worked there and then we kind of went back to bar dating.

142
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:36,303
So that's, that's how the journey of the martial arts, you know, but throughout that process, 1991 to 19, no 2006.

143
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:52,903
Before I met her, it was more like a lifestyle because I grew up in, what is it, the godfather, untouchable, the rap, kind of like in that environment, they were talking about how to make money, you know.

144
00:09:53,003 --> 00:09:54,923
So I got caught in that.

145
00:09:55,603 --> 00:10:02,525
So I was working security, but at the same time, I was more providing some service, you know.

146
00:10:03,025 --> 00:10:11,007
So I fell into bookie, you know, I fell into like, I did a favor, so if you need drug, I'm there for you, you know.

147
00:10:12,067 --> 00:10:20,631
And then, you know, I make a lot of money, but at the same time throughout that process, because the money, it was kind of like I stuck in between.

148
00:10:21,131 --> 00:10:29,315
And then I got arrested and then I won the case and then I decided to change my life, you know, and then.

149
00:10:30,075 --> 00:10:33,478
I remember one night I brought somebody out at the nightclub.

150
00:10:33,518 --> 00:10:37,301
I brought somebody out and then this guy was fighting, so I submit him.

151
00:10:38,042 --> 00:10:38,843
I hold him down.

152
00:10:38,983 --> 00:10:44,107
And then there's an older gentleman, he said, you know, he's, you know, he's done.

153
00:10:44,127 --> 00:10:46,890
So you just like let him be, let him go on.

154
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:53,775
And then he remind me back of my martial art lesson was that you're there to support, protect,

155
00:10:54,516 --> 00:10:56,997
is not doing out of integrity.

156
00:10:57,477 --> 00:11:05,640
So because of that, the life lesson teach me was the more money I make that not real money, not honest money, I lose it.

157
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,081
The faster I make, the faster I lose.

158
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:09,682
So because of that,

159
00:11:10,642 --> 00:11:12,464
We basically changed our lifestyle.

160
00:11:12,504 --> 00:11:22,394
We met, she came in and then she, you know, I always work all the time and then she told me like, you got to go vacation, you got to, you know, so I changed my lifestyle based on that.

161
00:11:23,395 --> 00:11:26,598
And then, you know, so throughout that process, I'm still training.

162
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:32,339
But because of the training is take who I was and who I was before.

163
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,401
So my, my life completely changed, reversed back to where I started.

164
00:11:38,161 --> 00:11:44,583
So, and then I basically, throughout that process, I teach in some school, but it's not about money.

165
00:11:44,883 --> 00:11:52,565
It's about changing the lifestyle, say kids, say no to drugs and support them in a positive environment.

166
00:11:53,065 --> 00:12:05,889
knowing the kid who needs support, knowing the kid who have challenges and be there almost like a mentor, but just to listen, you know, and then share with them my experience.

167
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:08,890
You know, if you do this way, there's consequence.

168
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:11,391
If you do this way, there's inspirations.

169
00:12:11,971 --> 00:12:13,332
So the choice they have to make.

170
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:15,693
And my job is not to judge them.

171
00:12:16,633 --> 00:12:19,276
My job is to provide information for them.

172
00:12:19,376 --> 00:12:21,518
So by that way, they make their own choice.

173
00:12:22,038 --> 00:12:26,323
You know, so, so that's what I fell in love with this one, the art.

174
00:12:26,443 --> 00:12:28,144
And then we move away, actually.

175
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:30,207
We moved 2006.

176
00:12:31,528 --> 00:12:32,589
I left the nightclub.

177
00:12:33,189 --> 00:12:34,751
I moved to Arizona.

178
00:12:35,732 --> 00:12:40,116
When I move over there, you know, like sometimes you feel like, for me anyway,

179
00:12:40,957 --> 00:12:44,941
You feel like you're changing your life, but you're not really changing your life.

180
00:12:45,481 --> 00:12:52,808
You move the environment, you go someplace, but there's something that brought you back to a regional and then you lost.

181
00:12:53,549 --> 00:12:56,391
And throughout that process, we have a family.

182
00:12:56,411 --> 00:12:57,572
We got married.

183
00:12:58,393 --> 00:13:01,776
And then after that, we decided we want to have kids.

184
00:13:02,517 --> 00:13:05,139
And the right time, we waited for eight years.

185
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:10,727
We didn't have kids and then suddenly we bankrupt.

186
00:13:11,088 --> 00:13:12,850
We got nothing and then the baby come.

187
00:13:14,413 --> 00:13:17,077
So that was, so we name our daughter was Patience.

188
00:13:17,437 --> 00:13:20,642
So it just remind us how much life you have to be patient.

189
00:13:20,977 --> 00:13:23,458
And then after that, I moved back here.

190
00:13:24,718 --> 00:13:34,620
And it's funny, things too, is that when you are someone, you give people a job, and then when you come back, you're on your knee, you're looking for a job, nobody give it to you.

191
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:40,222
You know, so, and then I end up, went back to one of my old friends, student,

192
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:46,026
I was teaching him for free just so I, by that way, I can have a place to live.

193
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:50,130
And meanwhile, my wife stayed over at their parent's house.

194
00:13:51,311 --> 00:13:53,814
So for me, it was one year.

195
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:57,837
I didn't see my kid, basically I see my kid one time a year.

196
00:13:58,318 --> 00:14:00,079
So that year I told her that.

197
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:04,644
We didn't have any money, so I have to go with my passion is.

198
00:14:05,565 --> 00:14:11,430
So I went teach for nothing for my student and then every single day he would get me a coffee.

199
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,980
you know, and something to eat.

200
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,241
So I teach them for about almost a year.

201
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:21,842
And then he decided to, because he got married and in the Cape.

202
00:14:22,482 --> 00:14:25,622
And then he asked me, he said, can you help me, you know, build a gym?

203
00:14:25,702 --> 00:14:27,043
So I helped him build a gym.

204
00:14:27,663 --> 00:14:30,303
And then one day he walked in and he gave me the key.

205
00:14:31,443 --> 00:14:32,284
And he said, thank you.

206
00:14:32,924 --> 00:14:35,484
That was it, because I was there for him and his son.

207
00:14:35,824 --> 00:14:39,525
You know, his son was passed away that year and I was with him.

208
00:14:40,525 --> 00:14:44,450
And because of that, he did that for me without any questions, you know.

209
00:14:45,391 --> 00:14:55,642
Because of that, I told myself to give back, you know, because something that he give out of love, nothing else, didn't expect anything.

210
00:14:56,263 --> 00:15:00,368
And then so I support him and then he did that and then I found love with him.

211
00:15:00,748 --> 00:15:04,469
And I want everybody to feel the same story that I have.

212
00:15:04,969 --> 00:15:13,411
So by that way, it's possible for them, you know, because sometimes I think people look on the negative side and the positive side, you know, so.

213
00:15:15,091 --> 00:15:18,192
And was there a reason that you decided to have Georgia in Medford?

214
00:15:19,012 --> 00:15:24,114
Well, it was already in Medford because that's where his student was and had the place in Medford.

215
00:15:24,154 --> 00:15:26,494
But then he also had the connection here from going to high school.

216
00:15:26,614 --> 00:15:27,134
Yeah.

217
00:15:27,654 --> 00:15:27,834
Yeah.

218
00:15:27,854 --> 00:15:29,895
I think you said you fell in love with Medford.

219
00:15:30,224 --> 00:15:38,472
Yeah, I fell in love with Medford because I remember that the mall right now, that's where Wegman is, it used to be Middle Glenville.

220
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:45,218
And when you walk in, there's a bunch of older gentlemen, Italian, that they sit, they would talk.

221
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:52,145
And I, when I was here, I loved to hear like when they're speaking, because I'm learning something because

222
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:59,693
I, you know, I told a student here, I said, I can't tell anybody's right or wrong because I'm still working my English.

223
00:15:59,713 --> 00:16:04,258
So I can't give you, I can't tell you wrong because the kid would be straightforward.

224
00:16:04,278 --> 00:16:06,360
They'd be like, well, you can't speak English well either.

225
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:06,961
You know what I'm saying?

226
00:16:07,381 --> 00:16:13,608
So, but I loved it because the community, you know, but at that time it was more like,

227
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:17,951
I didn't look at people as like different color.

228
00:16:18,452 --> 00:16:30,497
I look at people as just human, you know, and I loved it because every day I would go there after school, I would go there, all the gentlemen would sit there talking, you know, so I loved that as a community.

229
00:16:31,938 --> 00:16:41,022
What was it like to come back to Medford after Arizona and to your point, come back to like a familiar space, but also something that had changed?

230
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:54,275
I think the biggest thing for me was I told my wife when I told her that I'm going back to Boston, she was more, didn't want me to fall into the life that where I was, you know?

231
00:16:54,376 --> 00:16:59,258
So she said to me, and I said to her, I said, give me the opportunity and trust me.

232
00:17:00,522 --> 00:17:04,763
And within six months, I turned it around and make it possible.

233
00:17:04,943 --> 00:17:10,365
And then about, I think, nine months, she came and she see the place.

234
00:17:11,105 --> 00:17:17,707
And she said to me, she said, I will stay, only that if you let me support you.

235
00:17:18,727 --> 00:17:22,528
So we become a partnership on both sides because

236
00:17:23,468 --> 00:17:27,349
She knows what to support and I know what she needs support on.

237
00:17:27,389 --> 00:17:44,454
So we're more like a partnership than anything, you know, and I think that's what make our relationship stronger because we truly like talk to each other and respect each other because we have a boundary, you know, and we understand that what my role is, what her role is.

238
00:17:44,794 --> 00:17:48,095
So same thing, we take that role to go home.

239
00:17:49,195 --> 00:17:51,156
And be like, okay, this is my role.

240
00:17:51,456 --> 00:17:52,476
This is her role.

241
00:17:52,556 --> 00:17:59,058
So for us, it's more remind, you know, what the role is at work, what the role at home.

242
00:17:59,098 --> 00:18:01,979
So by that way, we don't have the cross line.

243
00:18:02,899 --> 00:18:04,939
Just keep your side of the street clean and you're good.

244
00:18:05,139 --> 00:18:05,700
Yeah.

245
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:11,944
I wonder what this, what his story is bringing up for you and how your sort of memory evolved.

246
00:18:12,204 --> 00:18:15,206
I mean, I mean, I have a different journey, obviously, with martial arts.

247
00:18:15,286 --> 00:18:20,411
I mean, I grew up in New Hampshire, so totally different, you know, coming from a different background and everything.

248
00:18:20,511 --> 00:18:26,636
But yeah, I originally came to Medford because I was a student house.

249
00:18:26,696 --> 00:18:30,819
And I bartended at Avalon during college to pay for school.

250
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,461
And that's when I met him.

251
00:18:32,661 --> 00:18:35,403
And I was always interested in martial arts and always wanted to

252
00:18:36,584 --> 00:18:37,505
trained martial arts.

253
00:18:37,565 --> 00:18:41,107
I mean, I grew up watching, for me, martial arts was seen in movies.

254
00:18:41,388 --> 00:18:46,451
It was like the Ninja Turtles, you know, and like, I love Ernie Bass Jr.

255
00:18:46,651 --> 00:18:51,515
and Red Sonja with Arnold Schwarzenegger and I loved all those movies.

256
00:18:51,595 --> 00:18:53,336
And so I was like, drawn to it from that.

257
00:18:53,817 --> 00:18:53,937
And

258
00:18:54,998 --> 00:18:56,379
And I was like, oh, that's really cool.

259
00:18:56,419 --> 00:18:58,061
But I never had access to that.

260
00:18:58,101 --> 00:19:00,624
I never had any place to go to do that when I was a kid.

261
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:06,350
And then I met him and I was like, oh, well, and we started talking about it and it just was a mutual interest.

262
00:19:07,811 --> 00:19:08,993
And then I started training.

263
00:19:09,073 --> 00:19:14,939
But yeah, I mean, we came to like, we didn't actually live in Medford at that time.

264
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:16,420
We kind of moved around a lot.

265
00:19:17,395 --> 00:19:27,318
We, and then we moved, we decided to move to Arizona in 2006 because we were trying to, again, kind of like he said, start a new life and to kind of make a change.

266
00:19:27,718 --> 00:19:32,199
And like he said, sometimes you move to a place, but you haven't changed yourself.

267
00:19:32,959 --> 00:19:36,620
So we kind of, I mean, it was, it was, everything happens the way it's supposed to happen.

268
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,480
And I'm really glad that we went through that.

269
00:19:39,101 --> 00:19:40,121
We moved out there.

270
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:47,050
Things didn't change because we didn't change, but we, you know, did encounter an opportunity.

271
00:19:47,091 --> 00:19:48,793
We did a, we did a course out there.

272
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:51,016
It was kind of like a personal growth course.

273
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:56,405
And I think that that was sort of a benchmark for us to really look inside and change what was inside.

274
00:19:57,225 --> 00:20:05,312
And then after that, after having our kid, our first daughter patients, like that was a major shift for, for both of us.

275
00:20:05,392 --> 00:20:08,155
But yes, we lost everything.

276
00:20:08,195 --> 00:20:09,095
We had bankruptcy.

277
00:20:09,135 --> 00:20:10,256
We had our car recess.

278
00:20:10,296 --> 00:20:11,938
We lost our house before closure.

279
00:20:12,598 --> 00:20:15,421
We lost everything and had a baby at the same time.

280
00:20:16,001 --> 00:20:20,765
So that was definitely, I think, the hardest year of my life, but I learned so much from it.

281
00:20:20,785 --> 00:20:29,151
And I feel like a lot of times when you go through hard things, it makes you a stronger person in the end and it actually propels you forward to grow more.

282
00:20:29,251 --> 00:20:31,673
So I think that that was actually something that was good for us.

283
00:20:32,474 --> 00:20:35,936
And I feel like if we hadn't been through that, we wouldn't have come back here.

284
00:20:35,976 --> 00:20:37,537
We wouldn't have built a business together.

285
00:20:37,698 --> 00:20:39,419
We wouldn't have built a family together even.

286
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,142
So when we did come back here, you know, yeah, we had to

287
00:20:44,478 --> 00:20:46,859
find our way again and kind of rebuild.

288
00:20:47,059 --> 00:20:49,521
And it was definitely a slow process at first.

289
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,182
And at first I wasn't like sure.

290
00:20:51,402 --> 00:20:56,525
When he came here, I was staying with my parents in Maryland, so we weren't like together.

291
00:20:57,045 --> 00:21:04,649
So it was hard to kind of trust like, okay, you know, is he, he's in the same place, Boston, Medford area.

292
00:21:04,729 --> 00:21:09,552
So I knew like, is he going to start hanging out with the old people that he hung out with before?

293
00:21:10,392 --> 00:21:12,713
Is it just going to be the same thing that it was before?

294
00:21:12,893 --> 00:21:14,393
But then he showed me that it wasn't.

295
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:25,216
And I think like having our kind of like having patients made that change, but also the journey that we had when we were out in Arizona and going through all that created that change as well.

296
00:21:25,956 --> 00:21:32,858
And then we were able to kind of, you know, come together and build something together and support each other to make it even better.

297
00:21:33,239 --> 00:21:34,199
So, yeah.

298
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:40,081
I like this sort of like thread of like these different sort of value shifts that you talked about in your journey.

299
00:21:40,141 --> 00:21:45,544
And it sounds like your beginnings maybe were based on like survival, right?

300
00:21:45,564 --> 00:21:51,787
I have to like, I have to make money so that I can like, you know, do the things that I want to do or I have to train so that I can, you know, meet these goals.

301
00:21:51,827 --> 00:21:55,849
And I wonder, like, it sounds like the challenges that you faced kind of

302
00:21:56,949 --> 00:22:04,877
allowed you to look at yourselves and sort of know yourselves more deeply and who you want to be and where you want to go and perhaps your children had a part of that.

303
00:22:04,897 --> 00:22:08,021
I wonder how, how do you take those values into your work?

304
00:22:08,922 --> 00:22:16,990
I think the biggest thing for me as you know, as grown up, see the environment move fast and then when I changing, and I think

305
00:22:18,331 --> 00:22:29,919
For me personally, when I have my daughter came and totally allowed me to look at myself and be like, do I want my daughter to hang out with somebody that was like me?

306
00:22:30,859 --> 00:22:33,781
You know, so that's a big shift for me.

307
00:22:34,282 --> 00:22:42,307
Um, and I used to, growing up in Boston, you know, you swear all the time, you know, and when my daughter was born, my life totally changed.

308
00:22:42,367 --> 00:22:43,528
I don't swear, you know.

309
00:22:44,308 --> 00:22:51,173
And I have a big value is that you can't expect your kid to do something if you're not willing to do it yourself.

310
00:22:51,773 --> 00:23:02,901
And as the same, as the environment for me was growing up, that you never hear the word, I love you, or you had never hear, or you never have a parent hug you.

311
00:23:03,262 --> 00:23:09,046
So it's totally different perspective of me knowing that my kid was born and I was there for her.

312
00:23:09,706 --> 00:23:13,408
And I learned how to hug and love through our relationship.

313
00:23:14,088 --> 00:23:20,871
Because I was one of those like dating never hold hand, you know, because I didn't grow up that affections, you know.

314
00:23:21,411 --> 00:23:23,012
So because of that, my life changed.

315
00:23:23,812 --> 00:23:26,533
And because that lesson, it showed me that

316
00:23:28,066 --> 00:23:31,928
I have to be able to look at myself where I want to go, you know.

317
00:23:32,249 --> 00:23:39,133
And the biggest thing for me was, do I want to be the person that bring people in a darkness place?

318
00:23:40,014 --> 00:23:45,037
Or do I want to bring to the people that the fun place knowing that they deserve to be?

319
00:23:45,837 --> 00:23:48,119
Because I looked deep inside myself as that.

320
00:23:49,221 --> 00:23:55,826
I want the same thing as everybody wants, knowledge, attention, you know, all that, that we're all born, we need it, you know.

321
00:23:56,126 --> 00:24:05,953
And, and because of that, I look at my daughter every single day and it doesn't matter if you have a bad day, good day, she knows exactly to run at you.

322
00:24:06,894 --> 00:24:10,056
So it's, to me, that's what really love is about.

323
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:12,878
It's not about what you did wrong.

324
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:17,240
It's knowing that the person needs support, you know, and, and she was young.

325
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:23,364
She doesn't know like to speak yet, but she knows like when you need it, you know?

326
00:24:23,484 --> 00:24:25,045
So for me, that's big.

327
00:24:25,085 --> 00:24:31,849
So because of that, I want to give everybody the same opportunity to see who they are.

328
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:35,432
You read Regatta, they want an ear to listen.

329
00:24:36,412 --> 00:24:42,836
Or they want, you know, to just sit there and look with each other without talking, you know, and we are there for.

330
00:24:42,976 --> 00:24:46,098
And I think the biggest thing for us as a business person.

331
00:24:47,335 --> 00:25:06,718
Because we are success due to we there for their need, not as my need, you know, because I think that big for me as a community and as growing together, you know, because I noticed that for me is that when I give that

332
00:25:08,081 --> 00:25:09,342
it fulfilled back to me.

333
00:25:10,263 --> 00:25:16,167
At the same time, I look at a blessing, it's not like, well, they need me.

334
00:25:16,608 --> 00:25:17,268
You know what I'm saying?

335
00:25:17,448 --> 00:25:18,289
It's opposite.

336
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:22,332
They give me that because I'm there for them.

337
00:25:23,093 --> 00:25:27,756
So, you know, but that's just the way how I look at my business within people.

338
00:25:28,477 --> 00:25:36,681
You know, so, and I say this all the time with people is that I'm lucky to have the opportunity to be with them.

339
00:25:37,101 --> 00:25:40,603
You know, sometimes people come in, they always say, oh, no, thank you.

340
00:25:40,643 --> 00:25:41,143
You're great.

341
00:25:41,323 --> 00:25:43,825
I say, no, without you, I would not be here.

342
00:25:43,925 --> 00:25:46,466
So I recognize that, you know, so.

343
00:25:48,116 --> 00:25:48,757
Cute.

344
00:25:50,058 --> 00:25:59,546
So many things while you're talking and thinking about something that I say a lot that from my perspective, if you're doing it right, parenting should both soften and radicalize you.

345
00:25:59,566 --> 00:26:06,632
And your moment of like having this new baby for the first time and your identity changing as parents is resonating for me.

346
00:26:07,352 --> 00:26:13,915
And I, when my kids came in, I'm also like a doula and a CLC, so I'm with brand new parents all the time.

347
00:26:14,095 --> 00:26:20,897
I think it helps you evaluate what systems have interacted with your life and why and what energy you gave back to them.

348
00:26:21,337 --> 00:26:28,560
And then like what you're hoping for those link folders and what those same systems might, may or may not do to your child based on.

349
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:32,241
what choices you make today and every day, and it's heavy.

350
00:26:32,481 --> 00:26:40,063
But I think also your commentary, which resonates for me, feels Asiatic in that, like, all of the children are our children.

351
00:26:40,323 --> 00:26:44,744
If you're an adult, the well-being of the child is our responsibility all the time, every day.

352
00:26:44,764 --> 00:26:46,424
It's not a biological thing.

353
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:49,985
It's an investing because it's an absolute, it's a village.

354
00:26:50,145 --> 00:26:58,427
So I love that it feels like you're bringing that energy to the space where kids are encouraged first to be heard and bound.

355
00:26:59,327 --> 00:27:01,268
I would validate and listen to you.

356
00:27:01,928 --> 00:27:05,329
Because I think, I think personally for me, we are all human.

357
00:27:05,689 --> 00:27:07,049
You know, we love each other.

358
00:27:07,149 --> 00:27:17,471
We just have a different way of express, you know, for example, I'll give you a perspective of how I was, you know, so I do this program.

359
00:27:17,491 --> 00:27:20,332
There's one program it's called, what is it, EM.

360
00:27:22,187 --> 00:27:23,748
Ima, it's called Ima.

361
00:27:24,188 --> 00:27:24,468
Okay.

362
00:27:24,968 --> 00:27:33,811
Kid that cool, I don't, I don't like to say special because I believe that we all want the same thing, love and recognition, you know.

363
00:27:34,532 --> 00:27:44,175
And so I was teaching that program and I, you know, sometimes people say to me, say, do you have like a special class for those person?

364
00:27:44,795 --> 00:27:45,736
I said to them, I said,

365
00:27:46,436 --> 00:27:48,597
There is no such thing as separations.

366
00:27:49,078 --> 00:27:52,800
I believe that I have to find a way to communicate with them.

367
00:27:53,361 --> 00:28:01,646
You know, for example, I was working with this kid that he punched, you know, but he doesn't know like, you know, how he punched.

368
00:28:02,426 --> 00:28:05,328
So for me, I have to find a way to connect with them.

369
00:28:05,989 --> 00:28:09,511
So in some way, he's teaching me how to communicate with them.

370
00:28:09,791 --> 00:28:22,447
You know, so I don't like to, I don't like to dissect people how they should belong to this group or that group because, you know, I believe that we should respect each other to this standpoint in the communications.

371
00:28:22,988 --> 00:28:25,871
You know, for example, I have a lady that she trained here.

372
00:28:26,052 --> 00:28:27,594
She doesn't speak, she's deaf.

373
00:28:28,955 --> 00:28:32,239
So, you know, she's teaching me how to communicate with her.

374
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:41,688
So there's an opportunity to learn from one another, you know, and, you know, and I believe that that's what we should do with everybody, you know, so.

375
00:28:42,337 --> 00:28:54,820
Yeah, actually I just kind of want to add on too with, you know, they mentioned like this village parenting, but I feel like there's also this other aspect that happens here with the kids helping the kids, which I think is really, really powerful.

376
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:57,901
Like we have a leadership program, a mentor program.

377
00:28:58,041 --> 00:29:05,443
And I feel like sometimes, you know, with parenting, sometimes you feel like you need to be everything for your kid, but you can't be everything to one person.

378
00:29:05,463 --> 00:29:09,384
And sometimes they need to have that interaction or learn from

379
00:29:09,964 --> 00:29:11,126
different people in different ways.

380
00:29:11,346 --> 00:29:16,013
And I love seeing when the kids actually help each other and unprompted too.

381
00:29:16,053 --> 00:29:21,020
You see it all the time where the kids support each other and learn from each other and help each other grow.

382
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,422
And that's really powerful too.

383
00:29:22,952 --> 00:29:23,932
I think nor should you.

384
00:29:24,092 --> 00:29:33,094
I think like a village expectation lends to children filling into like a natural hierarchy that they will build into on their own.

385
00:29:33,214 --> 00:29:33,635
Yeah.

386
00:29:33,655 --> 00:29:43,557
Whereas like a, there's an article in the HuffPost entitled The Mistake of the Nuclear Family, probably about six months ago, but I thought a lot about how children's culture is like.

387
00:29:43,697 --> 00:29:53,929
dissipating and also the toolkit that they get from participating is no longer going to be a meal to children if we can't build spaces like this for them, you know.

388
00:29:55,773 --> 00:29:59,074
Yeah, you used the word empowerment in the very beginning of our talk today.

389
00:29:59,114 --> 00:30:00,434
I wonder how does that come up?

390
00:30:00,934 --> 00:30:07,336
You sort of, I think, giving a good picture of how you like, you think about it, but how does it come up in your practice?

391
00:30:07,756 --> 00:30:10,656
Let me see how I answer this.

392
00:30:11,117 --> 00:30:12,517
Yeah, you can go ahead, yeah.

393
00:30:12,797 --> 00:30:15,598
I think the word is empowerment for me.

394
00:30:15,758 --> 00:30:22,759
So the way how my brain processes, I usually take the word in English, translate to my language and then refers back.

395
00:30:22,879 --> 00:30:25,360
So I was grown up in that environment.

396
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:30,785
And I always believe that, you know, you have a choice to inspire someone.

397
00:30:31,105 --> 00:30:31,406
Okay.

398
00:30:31,646 --> 00:30:35,490
And I believe that everyone already have what they needed.

399
00:30:36,331 --> 00:30:39,033
They just need someone to remind them.

400
00:30:39,454 --> 00:30:46,801
It may click it to them to, for me, to inspire them, to empower them, to see what there's possibility.

401
00:30:46,941 --> 00:30:47,141
Yeah.

402
00:30:47,161 --> 00:30:47,362
Okay.

403
00:30:47,822 --> 00:30:55,628
For example, when we teach in class, when I teach a class, I usually, the reason why we have a mirror over here is so, for people to see themselves.

404
00:30:56,869 --> 00:31:01,152
And usually when end of the class, I have the kid look at the mirror.

405
00:31:01,813 --> 00:31:02,033
Okay.

406
00:31:02,633 --> 00:31:05,476
And I have thing that always remind them.

407
00:31:06,216 --> 00:31:12,341
So we will look in the mirror and I will say to them, like they see themselves in the mirror and they take a finger and they say, you're awesome.

408
00:31:12,841 --> 00:31:14,463
And then they reply, they say, I'm awesome.

409
00:31:15,235 --> 00:31:22,662
Because for them, they see what possible, Ralph, you know, like for example, a bad environment, they adapted to that.

410
00:31:22,862 --> 00:31:24,443
It's not that they, their choice.

411
00:31:25,024 --> 00:31:26,365
It's just, they seen that a lot.

412
00:31:26,745 --> 00:31:26,985
Yeah.

413
00:31:27,025 --> 00:31:30,729
So in here we want them to see what possible, who they are.

414
00:31:31,349 --> 00:31:33,670
And who they should be is themselves.

415
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:39,571
You know, and I think a lot of time people judge kids by the way who, how fast they move.

416
00:31:40,111 --> 00:31:40,431
Okay.

417
00:31:40,811 --> 00:31:50,654
How much they be able to, like, um, like I was talking to some parents, you know, like some kid, they move so fast, like a computer, you know, they move so fast.

418
00:31:51,314 --> 00:31:54,257
So your job, you can't really judge a kid who they are.

419
00:31:54,317 --> 00:31:59,822
You have to be able to catch up to them so by the way, you can communicate with them, you know?

420
00:32:00,123 --> 00:32:09,071
So I want them to see like who they are can inspire to who they are, not what my expectation is, you know?

421
00:32:10,658 --> 00:32:12,299
I like that element of like choice, right?

422
00:32:12,339 --> 00:32:13,640
Like our, like empowerment.

423
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:20,184
We like that example of like when we see our kids do things that like are great and like, we haven't told them to do it right.

424
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:25,387
Like that we're sort of like giving them the options and, and like sort of trusting them to do what's best for them.

425
00:32:25,887 --> 00:32:27,108
And that being really empowering.

426
00:32:27,588 --> 00:32:34,533
I feel like when I've thought about, and I've heard about like martial arts and like self-defense courses, there's this like,

427
00:32:35,413 --> 00:32:38,775
expectation of like, well, you need this to be able to protect yourself.

428
00:32:38,855 --> 00:32:44,399
And like, at which I think like, is kind of a, like, can feel like a harmful message, right?

429
00:32:44,419 --> 00:32:48,162
Like if you're not strong, then people could do things to you that like, you don't want to happen to you.

430
00:32:48,182 --> 00:32:56,568
And like, versus like, I think this, like building up that sense of who you are so that you can feel good in the world rather than feeling like you're vulnerable all the time.

431
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:56,888
Right.

432
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:07,127
So, so, you know, the, the way how I create this program is just basically based on my life and based on what I see.

433
00:33:07,808 --> 00:33:08,048
Okay.

434
00:33:08,428 --> 00:33:16,114
So for example, when we're teaching class, we always, the first thing is I want the kid to recognize who supports them.

435
00:33:16,874 --> 00:33:18,436
Because for us, it's big.

436
00:33:18,936 --> 00:33:20,777
For the kid, it's the parent brought you here.

437
00:33:21,378 --> 00:33:25,541
So I want them to usually, because I grew up, there's no affection.

438
00:33:26,221 --> 00:33:28,803
So usually when I teach a class, I say, okay, who brought you here?

439
00:33:28,843 --> 00:33:31,285
They say, my mom, my dad, whoever.

440
00:33:31,405 --> 00:33:33,207
I said, okay, did you say thank you to them?

441
00:33:33,227 --> 00:33:33,967
Did you hug them?

442
00:33:34,027 --> 00:33:35,188
It's to appreciate them.

443
00:33:36,349 --> 00:33:38,191
That's the first step, you know.

444
00:33:38,331 --> 00:33:41,013
And then we give them the opportunity to see.

445
00:33:41,613 --> 00:33:44,575
And I always say this, you either choose in or choose out.

446
00:33:46,036 --> 00:33:47,477
And you have to make that choice.

447
00:33:47,897 --> 00:33:51,259
I can present it to you, but you have to choose in and choose out.

448
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:57,243
Of course, young kid, I have to kind of give them what I call a keyword and then remind them.

449
00:33:57,784 --> 00:33:58,024
Okay.

450
00:33:58,484 --> 00:34:06,029
So let's say if I asked her what her name is for that moment, she raised her hand up and then let's say she said, James, let's say.

451
00:34:06,913 --> 00:34:10,596
I clap the hand, I say, wow, you have so much courage, confidence, you speak up.

452
00:34:11,677 --> 00:34:14,219
And then I may ask, like, do you want me to call you James?

453
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:18,202
And then they decide to say, no, no, I want you to do this.

454
00:34:18,583 --> 00:34:21,285
And then I may say, okay, can you spell your name?

455
00:34:21,345 --> 00:34:26,189
So by that way, I want to make sure that I call you the way you want it.

456
00:34:26,809 --> 00:34:30,853
You know, so it's throughout the process, it's like, I want the kid to kind of see

457
00:34:31,892 --> 00:34:38,156
Or let's say if they break the rule for themselves, there's always a choice that you can correct.

458
00:34:39,116 --> 00:34:47,161
So the thing that I teach about here is there's a 4C that is very important to us.

459
00:34:47,301 --> 00:34:51,563
It's that communication, compassion, compromise, commitment.

460
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:53,284
Those are the things.

461
00:34:53,924 --> 00:34:58,067
And then there's a thing that we said, the 3R that you want to avoid.

462
00:34:58,827 --> 00:35:01,089
Resistance, resentment, revenge.

463
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:09,538
So what we tell them is that, okay, when you resist, what would you do before you hit to resentment, revenge?

464
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:10,559
Okay.

465
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:16,906
We will tell them, okay, you got replaced with the C, the four C. What's the first thing you need to do?

466
00:35:17,346 --> 00:35:18,127
Communications.

467
00:35:18,868 --> 00:35:29,892
You know, so we want people to understand that you can be able to fix that, you know, and I don't like to say the word fix, the choice that they have to make.

468
00:35:30,393 --> 00:35:32,313
So by that way, there's no conflict.

469
00:35:32,654 --> 00:35:34,914
That's about respect to each other, you know?

470
00:35:34,974 --> 00:35:40,577
And I think like, for me here, we focus more like life skill.

471
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:46,658
Then the martial art, however, we use the martial art to stimulate them so by the way, they learn better.

472
00:35:47,198 --> 00:35:53,041
You know, because it's just like any, any kid go to playground, they learn faster throughout the process.

473
00:35:53,281 --> 00:35:57,923
And throughout the process, we give them a lessons, the rule, and then the goal.

474
00:35:58,863 --> 00:35:59,123
Okay.

475
00:35:59,524 --> 00:36:03,525
For young kid, we say the skill, you know, because they go there like, what is that?

476
00:36:03,685 --> 00:36:07,747
You know, so... Do you have anything?

477
00:36:08,467 --> 00:36:10,468
No, not yet.

478
00:36:11,408 --> 00:36:11,908
Great.

479
00:36:11,928 --> 00:36:12,748
We've gotten to a lot.

480
00:36:12,848 --> 00:36:17,630
Is there anything that you want to like share just about the programming or how people can get involved?

481
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:23,631
So the program is the way I, you know, so I wrote the book, it's about based on the Mahashat.

482
00:36:24,031 --> 00:36:32,174
You know, each lesson on there, it's, I wrote a short chapter because I believe that it's easy for everybody to read.

483
00:36:32,554 --> 00:36:32,894
Okay.

484
00:36:33,074 --> 00:36:35,815
And the book is about when you step on a mat.

485
00:36:36,595 --> 00:36:38,576
We have the rule, what we call, we bow.

486
00:36:39,237 --> 00:36:43,900
When we bow, it's we acknowledge, you know, what we are going to do next.

487
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,341
Okay.

488
00:36:45,361 --> 00:36:50,344
And once we did that, the next step, it was talking about, you know, warm up.

489
00:36:50,984 --> 00:36:51,305
Okay.

490
00:36:51,325 --> 00:36:52,926
So what does warm up do for you?

491
00:36:53,766 --> 00:36:56,948
A warm-up can be sometimes people say, oh, get your bodies going.

492
00:36:57,608 --> 00:37:02,731
But in here, yes, we did get our body going, but that's not about part of it.

493
00:37:02,891 --> 00:37:05,772
It's about communication, get to know each other.

494
00:37:06,212 --> 00:37:09,254
And then we do as we do, so that we do warm-up.

495
00:37:09,734 --> 00:37:12,556
And next step we do what we call partner drill.

496
00:37:13,476 --> 00:37:15,256
So how would you work with partner?

497
00:37:15,456 --> 00:37:18,537
Let's say by you don't warm up with me, get to know me, would you trust me?

498
00:37:19,397 --> 00:37:22,498
So that's big for us each step of the lessons.

499
00:37:23,098 --> 00:37:26,779
And we want them to understand that lesson can be everywhere.

500
00:37:27,499 --> 00:37:27,799
Okay.

501
00:37:28,059 --> 00:37:34,381
Because sometimes I hear people say all the time, it's like, when you go this place, you got to check your ego and left out the door.

502
00:37:35,361 --> 00:37:37,862
I tell everybody, I said, you are only one person.

503
00:37:38,142 --> 00:37:42,763
Whatever you bring, you want to be able to bring it knowing

504
00:37:43,763 --> 00:37:46,186
Acknowledge that and then express it.

505
00:37:47,007 --> 00:37:47,147
Okay.

506
00:37:47,167 --> 00:37:50,691
Because, you know, sometimes people have stress, their lifetime.

507
00:37:50,911 --> 00:37:54,855
They don't want to yell because they feel like, well, somebody judging me.

508
00:37:55,796 --> 00:37:57,398
But in here, everybody yell.

509
00:37:58,668 --> 00:38:01,029
We don't swear, of course, but everybody yells.

510
00:38:01,089 --> 00:38:04,871
We want people to know how they feel when they yell.

511
00:38:05,011 --> 00:38:10,894
They let go of the stress, they let go of their challenge, or they want to accomplish something.

512
00:38:11,114 --> 00:38:15,656
So, you know, everybody has a different goal when they step on.

513
00:38:16,577 --> 00:38:22,360
But when they come out, I've never seen a person tell me that they come in with one goal and came out with one goal.

514
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:22,880
Yes.

515
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:28,943
You know, so it's, yeah, so it's, you know, and then we want, we create this community.

516
00:38:30,163 --> 00:38:31,204
It's about sharing.

517
00:38:32,084 --> 00:38:44,390
The purpose of community is because we always tell everybody is when you come in, number one, if you enjoy the community, number two, the environment, number three, if you enjoy the instructor.

518
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:45,350
Okay.

519
00:38:45,831 --> 00:38:50,693
Because if you don't enjoy that, we don't want you to be here because we don't want

520
00:38:51,233 --> 00:39:01,079
Every day you're like, oh, you know, we want you to be excited because end of day, off the way, how I look is like you dating you.

521
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,301
You come in here, you take care of you.

522
00:39:03,321 --> 00:39:06,623
If you don't enjoy you, who's not going to enjoy you?

523
00:39:06,643 --> 00:39:07,764
You know what I'm saying?

524
00:39:07,784 --> 00:39:10,906
Or like, I say this a lot, if you cheat on you.

525
00:39:12,107 --> 00:39:15,592
Don't expect the other person not to cheat on you, but don't get upset, you know?

526
00:39:16,233 --> 00:39:23,543
And, you know, I want them to acknowledge that, you know, let's say I say five push-ups and you do four push-ups.

527
00:39:24,204 --> 00:39:27,509
My job is to empower you, either I do with you,

528
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:28,850
Okay.

529
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:34,534
Or let you know what possible for you, you know, and I'll be there and support you.

530
00:39:34,554 --> 00:39:45,401
That's why I like to tell everybody is that when they come here, it's about partnership, you know, or like the other part is I always look at it as you buy, you, you get a top share.

531
00:39:46,201 --> 00:39:47,423
I want you to value it.

532
00:39:47,723 --> 00:39:49,605
I don't want you to pay for membership, don't come.

533
00:39:50,226 --> 00:40:01,298
You know, I want you to use it, you know, because end of the day is that, you know, you don't want to come in with 25 dumbbell of distress and then leave with 25 dumbbells of distress, you know, so, but.

534
00:40:01,643 --> 00:40:05,786
Yeah, so some details on how to find us and where to find us.

535
00:40:05,886 --> 00:40:08,527
First, the book, Step on the Map book by Ningen Nguyen.

536
00:40:09,108 --> 00:40:10,569
You can find it on Amazon.

537
00:40:10,669 --> 00:40:19,915
You can also find it online at steponthemapbook.com if you want to explore the book first before coming in or if you're not in Medford.

538
00:40:20,055 --> 00:40:23,237
The other option, if you are in Medford, come in and see us.

539
00:40:23,297 --> 00:40:24,938
Just stop in and say hi.

540
00:40:24,978 --> 00:40:28,320
We're very, we always strive to be a very welcoming community.

541
00:40:28,873 --> 00:40:36,156
That's probably the most important thing for me is I want people to come in and feel like they're coming home and coming to a family.

542
00:40:36,256 --> 00:40:44,319
So we offer free initial lessons for kids just and we usually what we do with that is we don't put them in the group first.

543
00:40:44,879 --> 00:40:46,540
We usually do a one-on-one with them.

544
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:55,406
And the reason why we do that is because we really want to make sure that we get a chance to connect with the kid so that we can kind of, you know, see where they are.

545
00:40:55,567 --> 00:41:02,492
You know, sometimes for some kids, they might have, you know, like, like stress or, you know, might be emotional or social.

546
00:41:02,532 --> 00:41:05,775
Sometimes it's more physical that we're kind of looking at and working on.

547
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:08,517
But we can't always tell that when it's in a group setting.

548
00:41:08,597 --> 00:41:14,361
It's easier for us to really connect and find out who they are and what we need to do to support them one on one.

549
00:41:14,381 --> 00:41:16,063
So we always do one on one with them first.

550
00:41:16,983 --> 00:41:21,648
And then we kind of go from there to guide them into what classes are kind of going to work best for them.

551
00:41:22,449 --> 00:41:23,490
Yeah, we do that for kids.

552
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:26,293
And then for, I mean, we do have adult program too, fitness.

553
00:41:26,353 --> 00:41:27,614
We do nutrition coaching.

554
00:41:27,874 --> 00:41:29,496
We do nutrition for kids as well.

555
00:41:29,836 --> 00:41:33,000
So yeah, there's always opportunities to live your healthy life.

556
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,522
And it's not just about kicking and punching.

557
00:41:35,602 --> 00:41:37,004
It's also about, you know, being

558
00:41:37,524 --> 00:41:40,485
social, being part of a group, being part of a community.

559
00:41:40,605 --> 00:41:47,028
It's also just, you know, your life, not on, not just on the mat, but off the mat and how you are as a person in the world.

560
00:41:47,609 --> 00:41:56,793
I think, I think for, for me anyway, you know, the biggest thing is when the kid come in for us is we want to know when the parent go is for their child.

561
00:41:56,853 --> 00:41:59,794
That's, that's why we do one-on-one with the kid.

562
00:41:59,894 --> 00:42:01,735
And then we have the opportunity to talk to the parent.

563
00:42:02,644 --> 00:42:11,226
For the adult, a lot of time, I've seen this all the time, is that people get timid, like you said, it's like into the martial art.

564
00:42:11,666 --> 00:42:15,287
But for us, we want the people to know how strong they are.

565
00:42:16,027 --> 00:42:16,327
Okay.

566
00:42:16,787 --> 00:42:25,950
Because for kickboxing, every couple of months, I let people breaking board, especially female, you know, because over there we have, I would say about 90% are female.

567
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:36,881
And, you know, a lot of times throughout their day lives, maybe someone say to them they're not strong or they compare with people who trained for years, you know.

568
00:42:37,362 --> 00:42:40,485
And we want them to see, because I have a lady that's 67 years old.

569
00:42:42,425 --> 00:42:44,606
And she just punch as hard as anybody, you know.

570
00:42:44,686 --> 00:42:49,287
So we want them to see what possible for them and how strong they are.

571
00:42:49,808 --> 00:42:53,869
You know, because throughout their life, you know, everything is just caught you by the day.

572
00:42:54,669 --> 00:42:57,210
So sometimes you forgot how strong you are, you know.

573
00:42:57,330 --> 00:43:00,031
You waking up in the morning, you're already strong, you know.

574
00:43:00,211 --> 00:43:03,052
You going to work, that's a strong day for you.

575
00:43:03,572 --> 00:43:07,534
But throughout the day, you may have a lesson that you're learning, you know.

576
00:43:07,674 --> 00:43:11,335
And then you just have to kind of like take that lesson and just let it out.

577
00:43:12,095 --> 00:43:14,738
You know, I mean, I do this all the time still.

578
00:43:14,918 --> 00:43:17,601
Sometime I open the door and I scream out like I'm excited.

579
00:43:18,582 --> 00:43:25,589
Sometime I drive in and the car roll down and I'm smiling, you know, because I want people to know that it's human being.

580
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:28,893
Whatever you feel, just let it out, you know, and it's okay.

581
00:43:29,357 --> 00:43:38,505
I like that like permission to explore a feeling or to express a feeling rather than I think what we hear a lot about is just like, like shutting down of that, especially in kids.

582
00:43:38,525 --> 00:43:39,766
Like you can't feel that's right.

583
00:43:39,806 --> 00:43:40,667
You can't feel angry.

584
00:43:40,707 --> 00:43:41,768
You can't feel frustrated.

585
00:43:41,808 --> 00:43:43,169
You have to just do what you have to do.

586
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:46,032
Being able to have that outlet sounds really valuable.

587
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:50,458
Yeah, I mean, you know, my country, they always say this, you should not cry.

588
00:43:51,659 --> 00:43:55,542
You know, so I grew up in an environment that you men should not cry.

589
00:43:55,562 --> 00:43:57,544
You should hold your feeling in, right?

590
00:43:57,984 --> 00:44:01,407
Or my parents always say this, you should know I love you.

591
00:44:01,427 --> 00:44:02,728
I don't need to tell you.

592
00:44:03,629 --> 00:44:07,192
So, you know, growing in that environment, you're like, you never tell me, I don't know.

593
00:44:07,892 --> 00:44:16,254
So now, because of that, I say to my kid, my wife all the time, every chance that I do, wake up in the morning, I hug them because I want them to know.

594
00:44:16,854 --> 00:44:21,615
Because I don't know what I can dream for life, but I don't know what tomorrow comes.

595
00:44:22,035 --> 00:44:25,896
So I want them to know that moment, I love you and I care for you.

596
00:44:26,516 --> 00:44:27,776
And then whatever that day is.

597
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:31,877
Of course, you know, my goal, of course, is to live longer, but I don't know.

598
00:44:32,357 --> 00:44:35,738
You know, so, so it's big for me, you know, on that standpoint.

599
00:44:39,318 --> 00:44:41,881
Anything we haven't asked you that you want to share?

600
00:44:42,201 --> 00:44:44,944
We are so grateful for what you've shared.

601
00:44:44,984 --> 00:44:45,344
Yes.

602
00:44:45,584 --> 00:44:48,827
Well, no, I appreciate you, you know, and I think, I think.

603
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:57,760
I hope, my goal and my hope is that everybody take the moment to appreciate themselves because they are matter.

604
00:44:58,181 --> 00:45:16,346
You know, and I say this, whenever sometimes people coming in, people I don't know and I shake their hands, you know, because I think like a lot of time, like I said earlier, is people's lives so busy, they don't take a moment to really recognize how great they are each day that they deal with challenges, you know.

605
00:45:16,366 --> 00:45:19,087
So I want to be able to create that environment.

606
00:45:19,687 --> 00:45:32,838
for the kid, for adult to see what possible for them, regardless of training to be a martial art, training to be competing, you know, or training each individual, because this sport is just about you.

607
00:45:33,799 --> 00:45:37,341
You know, there's nobody around to cheer for you, right?

608
00:45:37,602 --> 00:45:43,146
You go competing, you're on your own, you know, so you see like, okay, we're there to support you.

609
00:45:44,307 --> 00:45:46,548
but we're not fighting for you, you know.

610
00:45:46,648 --> 00:45:49,548
So I want people to understand is that the same thing as life.

611
00:45:50,348 --> 00:45:52,149
When you fall on your face, you have a choice.

612
00:45:52,889 --> 00:45:56,270
You know, you can get up and keep moving forward, you know.

613
00:45:56,790 --> 00:46:02,611
However, if you fall, there's somebody to support you, you know, but you can't be helped.

614
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:08,033
Like I always say to the kid, I said, no one in here needs help because if you need help, you need to call 911.

615
00:46:09,453 --> 00:46:22,155
And I always tease her now, I said, we don't have a patch, say, you know, rescue, you know, because you're here for who you are to step up and accept your greatness, you know, and that's big for us.

616
00:46:22,355 --> 00:46:25,976
Anything else to add?

617
00:46:27,536 --> 00:46:32,077
I just want to say thank you for the opportunity to share with you.

618
00:46:32,597 --> 00:46:38,098
Unless there's anything else you want us to talk about specifically Medford, is there anything that we didn't touch on there?

619
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:39,760
Good.

620
00:46:39,921 --> 00:46:40,541
Great.

621
00:46:40,621 --> 00:46:44,343
I just want to sign me up for a lesson.

622
00:46:44,743 --> 00:46:49,466
You can always come, check it out, take it to class, you know.

623
00:46:49,546 --> 00:46:49,766
Yeah.

624
00:46:49,786 --> 00:46:55,129
So I mean, like for, I mean, I don't, we didn't really get into this, but like the type of classes that we offer.

625
00:46:55,229 --> 00:47:00,513
So we do, you know, self-defense, we do karate, we do Muay Thai, which is Thai boxing.

626
00:47:00,693 --> 00:47:01,733
We do kickboxing.

627
00:47:01,873 --> 00:47:03,214
We also do strength training.

628
00:47:03,234 --> 00:47:04,215
So we have a weight room.

629
00:47:04,795 --> 00:47:07,517
I think one thing that a lot of people in Medford don't know

630
00:47:08,437 --> 00:47:10,199
is how big of a space we have.

631
00:47:10,339 --> 00:47:12,961
Like they look from the outside and they've never been in here.

632
00:47:13,662 --> 00:47:17,045
And a reaction we get a lot is like, oh, wow, I had no idea how big it was.

633
00:47:17,185 --> 00:47:17,425
Yeah.

634
00:47:17,605 --> 00:47:20,508
And they'll come in and like we have, you know, we have four studios in here.

635
00:47:20,528 --> 00:47:22,410
So we have two upstairs, two downstairs.

636
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:25,212
Oh, so a lot of times people like don't necessarily know that.

637
00:47:25,292 --> 00:47:28,635
And I think that's one thing that, you know, I'd love for people in Medford to come in and check it out.

638
00:47:28,715 --> 00:47:29,196
It's like.

639
00:47:29,937 --> 00:47:33,165
What you see on the outside is so deceptive to what's on the inside.

640
00:47:33,626 --> 00:47:36,392
So, and do this at other places in Medford too.

641
00:47:36,453 --> 00:47:38,958
Walk through the door and check it out because you don't know what you're going to find.

642
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:47,311
We always, you know, I always tell everyone, you know, it's when you come in, our job is to give you information.

643
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:54,612
And your job is to research and find something in your heart really tell you to go.

644
00:47:55,253 --> 00:48:02,094
You know, because we don't want, I mean, we want every business to be a success because I believe that everybody deserves to be a success.

645
00:48:02,654 --> 00:48:05,255
You know, however, I want people to understand is that

646
00:48:06,275 --> 00:48:08,656
Not, not this place meant for everybody.

647
00:48:09,176 --> 00:48:09,796
You know what I'm saying?

648
00:48:09,856 --> 00:48:21,479
So it's, you know, it's for them to trust themselves and be able to, you know, trust their heart situations, you know, because, you know, like the big thing I tell the parent all the time is trust your heart.

649
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:25,180
If this is the place for you, go for it.

650
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:32,782
Give us the opportunity to show you, but if your heart tell you this is not the place, don't be in it, you know, trust your instinct.

651
00:48:33,063 --> 00:48:33,884
And that's okay with us.

652
00:48:34,044 --> 00:48:36,287
I mean, to me, I'm like, you can't be everything to everyone.

653
00:48:36,487 --> 00:48:38,829
So, you know, if it's, if you love us, great.

654
00:48:38,929 --> 00:48:39,850
If you don't, that's fine.

655
00:48:41,372 --> 00:48:41,932
Go to you.

656
00:48:42,073 --> 00:48:42,833
Come to us.

657
00:48:42,914 --> 00:48:46,077
Well, that seems like it's perfect.

658
00:48:46,097 --> 00:48:46,377
Yeah.

659
00:48:46,417 --> 00:48:46,738
Thank you.

660
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:47,699

661
