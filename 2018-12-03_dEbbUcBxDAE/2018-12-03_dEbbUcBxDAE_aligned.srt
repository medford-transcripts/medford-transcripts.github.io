1
00:24:03,307 --> 00:24:13,592
have played a positive role in the lives of so many of the students here and how they've gone on to have great success in their careers.

2
00:24:14,132 --> 00:24:21,075
So I just want to congratulate them all, all the inductees, and just encourage that positive work.

3
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:24,917
Also yesterday was the Jingle Bell

4
00:24:25,809 --> 00:24:35,577
run and my associate superintendent, Diane Caldwell, and many others were there to participate in that fundraiser.

5
00:24:36,037 --> 00:24:41,041
And that was a fun event for families and children of all ages.

6
00:24:41,862 --> 00:24:51,030
And I really hope that it was a fruitful, or I would say lucrative, fundraiser for them.

7
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:53,952
But it was definitely the holiday spirit

8
00:24:54,415 --> 00:24:56,096
reindeers and other things.

9
00:24:56,736 --> 00:25:00,578
So I was pleased to hear that that was a great event.

10
00:25:01,198 --> 00:25:12,703
And my final comments will be, since this is our short week, Wednesday is early release for all of our schools because we're getting ready to go into the Thanksgiving holiday break.

11
00:25:12,763 --> 00:25:16,304
So I just wish all of you a happy Thanksgiving break.

12
00:25:16,384 --> 00:25:20,106
If you do celebrate it and just enjoy the time with your family and friends.

13
00:25:20,546 --> 00:25:20,926
Thank you.

14
00:25:21,487 --> 00:25:21,827
Thank you.

15
00:25:23,577 --> 00:25:26,179
I know a few of the colleagues were at the run yesterday.

16
00:25:26,199 --> 00:25:27,700
I'd say about 600 people.

17
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:35,667
I know they pre-registered like 560, and people were still coming in well after the official start.

18
00:25:36,027 --> 00:25:37,688
So it was a very successful program.

19
00:25:37,708 --> 00:25:40,851
I know all the money goes back to the individual schools that raised it.

20
00:25:40,951 --> 00:25:48,777
So I'm sure we'll be seeing the Jingle Bell people at an upcoming meeting, where they'll be distributing nice checks back to the PTOs and the school department.

21
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,359
So great day overall.

22
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:51,832
Ms.

23
00:25:51,852 --> 00:25:52,273
Van de Kloot.

24
00:25:52,293 --> 00:26:10,372
I just think that that was Judy Lonergan's baby and that she was the one who started it and I think that whenever we talk about we should mention because it was a great idea and she really put a lot of work into it and she got it off the ground and we're really, our schools have really benefited from the fundraising that the run accomplishes.

25
00:26:11,193 --> 00:26:11,553
Very good.

26
00:26:11,633 --> 00:26:11,994
Thank you.

27
00:26:12,214 --> 00:26:12,534
Thank you.

28
00:26:13,665 --> 00:26:17,628
First item under the reports of the superintendent, report on Project HAIR grant.

29
00:26:17,848 --> 00:26:20,870
Yes, Project HAIR grant will be presented by Rachel Perry.

30
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:21,330
Thank you.

31
00:26:21,571 --> 00:26:22,331
Please come forward.

32
00:26:23,072 --> 00:26:23,492
Hello, Ms.

33
00:26:23,512 --> 00:26:23,812
Perry.

34
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:27,535
Good evening, Mayor Burke, Superintendent Vincent, members of the school committee.

35
00:26:28,515 --> 00:26:37,842
The Project HAIR substance use prevention curriculum grant has provided select middle schools funding to implement one of three evidence-based prevention curricula.

36
00:26:38,287 --> 00:26:41,908
One is which is the Michigan model, which we already have.

37
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:45,890
We have the Michigan model from K-12.

38
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:55,653
And what we're going to use it for, since we already have it, we're going to use the $13,387 for training for our staff.

39
00:26:55,993 --> 00:27:04,076
It will give them a two-day full training in the Michigan model with specifics to the substance use prevention units.

40
00:27:05,099 --> 00:27:10,161
That will be for our physical education, health education, and guidance counseling staff.

41
00:27:11,381 --> 00:27:20,124
We also have a little bit of money left over to make sure that we purchase extra kits for our guidance counsel so that they all have their each individual kits.

42
00:27:20,725 --> 00:27:30,228
We've been working really hard since I took over the department about four years ago to really increase our curriculum around substance use prevention.

43
00:27:30,388 --> 00:27:33,449
We had a school committee meeting about that time and

44
00:27:34,286 --> 00:27:37,048
There was a lot going on in the state, in the country.

45
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:39,610
And we've come a long way since then.

46
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:44,673
And this is just a great opportunity for us to really train our staff.

47
00:27:45,574 --> 00:27:48,616
How many members will be participating in this training?

48
00:27:48,636 --> 00:27:48,616
22.

49
00:27:48,676 --> 00:27:50,337
Awesome.

50
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:51,398
And how many are already trained?

51
00:27:52,258 --> 00:27:55,300
So we had a training for elementary staff.

52
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:59,443
So all the elementary teachers were trained, except the phys ed weren't trained at that time.

53
00:28:00,083 --> 00:28:00,404
Very good.

54
00:28:00,584 --> 00:28:00,924
Thank you.

55
00:28:01,504 --> 00:28:02,245
Are there any questions?

56
00:28:03,946 --> 00:28:08,029
Motion to accept this report, placed it on file by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Mr. Russo.

57
00:28:08,689 --> 00:28:09,390
All those in favor?

58
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:09,470
Aye.

59
00:28:10,411 --> 00:28:11,091
All those opposed?

60
00:28:11,431 --> 00:28:12,132
Motion passes.

61
00:28:12,172 --> 00:28:12,532
Thank you.

62
00:28:12,572 --> 00:28:13,032
Thank you.

63
00:28:13,092 --> 00:28:13,833
Happy Thanksgiving.

64
00:28:14,233 --> 00:28:14,653
Same to you.

65
00:28:14,713 --> 00:28:15,074
Thank you.

66
00:28:16,034 --> 00:28:18,616
Report on Childhood Obesity Prevention Program.

67
00:28:18,996 --> 00:28:24,800
Yes, I'd like to ask Tony Vento, our Supervisor of Health Services, to please come forward.

68
00:28:25,301 --> 00:28:25,541
Thank you.

69
00:28:25,561 --> 00:28:26,041
Good evening.

70
00:28:26,061 --> 00:28:29,804
Good evening, Mabel Burke, Superintendent Edward Vincent, and members of the school committee.

71
00:28:30,338 --> 00:28:38,581
So I'm reporting on a donation that was offered to the Medford Public Schools from Hallmark Health, now known as Melrose-Wakefield Hospital.

72
00:28:38,901 --> 00:28:46,543
And I wanted to thank Paul Russo, because it was a contact of his that brought this idea our way.

73
00:28:46,563 --> 00:28:52,405
We know childhood obesity is a serious public health issue.

74
00:28:52,646 --> 00:28:58,908
And we, as many other schools across the country, are providing many strategies to address the situation.

75
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:10,360
The data that the school nurses collect in Medford shows grade 4 overweight and obesity rates to be between 43 and 45 percent.

76
00:29:12,261 --> 00:29:14,403
And we have a lot of programs.

77
00:29:14,443 --> 00:29:17,445
We have regularly scheduled physical education classes.

78
00:29:17,485 --> 00:29:19,907
We have dedicated recess time.

79
00:29:20,507 --> 00:29:26,151
We have the food nutrition program, which promotes healthy food and vegetables and portion control.

80
00:29:27,704 --> 00:29:33,547
So we are making a lot of similar movements as other schools across the country.

81
00:29:35,068 --> 00:29:45,795
So the donation that we're receiving is $2,000, and it's initially funded by the Bruins Foundation with the goal of promoting physical activity for children.

82
00:29:46,215 --> 00:29:55,902
When Rachel Perry and I met with the community representative from Hallmark Health, we decided we'd like to include all children at the grade 4 level.

83
00:29:56,984 --> 00:30:18,646
So we decided to use the gift to augment the physical education program that's already standing by buying personal pedometers for all the fourth grade students and setting up, you know, we're looking to promote and recognize the benefits of walking and developing that into your own ongoing personal fitness throughout your lifestyle.

84
00:30:20,239 --> 00:30:22,101
So everyone will get a personal pedometer.

85
00:30:22,121 --> 00:30:25,724
They'll record their steps through the week.

86
00:30:25,884 --> 00:30:30,548
And we're hoping that we can get teachers to encourage students to graph.

87
00:30:30,748 --> 00:30:34,451
The class can graph their steps and have a little class competition.

88
00:30:35,172 --> 00:30:41,097
And at the end of the program, we will award a prize to the class with the highest number of steps.

89
00:30:41,977 --> 00:30:44,840
We expect to run the program for 10 weeks between March 22nd and May 31st.

90
00:30:48,673 --> 00:30:49,113
Wonderful.

91
00:30:49,193 --> 00:30:49,934
Thank you very much.

92
00:30:49,954 --> 00:30:51,335
Thank you, Mr. Russo.

93
00:30:51,375 --> 00:30:53,537
Mr. Russo.

94
00:30:53,677 --> 00:30:55,098
Thank you.

95
00:30:55,239 --> 00:30:55,659
Thank you.

96
00:30:55,819 --> 00:31:00,743
I just wanted to highlight how quickly this all happened.

97
00:31:01,384 --> 00:31:08,550
I had to go back in my emails, and I first was contacted on August 29th of this year.

98
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:15,636
So I was really surprised when I saw this on the agenda, because this

99
00:31:16,703 --> 00:31:18,943
This level of efficiency needs to be highlighted.

100
00:31:21,844 --> 00:31:25,145
So thank you so much for getting it just done so quickly.

101
00:31:25,165 --> 00:31:25,425
Thank you.

102
00:31:25,565 --> 00:31:25,925
Thank you.

103
00:31:26,725 --> 00:31:27,205
Very good.

104
00:31:27,225 --> 00:31:28,045
Is there a motion?

105
00:31:28,245 --> 00:31:29,126
Mr. Ruggiero?

106
00:31:31,046 --> 00:31:31,846
Do we have a sense?

107
00:31:31,926 --> 00:31:34,807
So you have the overweight and obesity statistic together.

108
00:31:34,827 --> 00:31:38,968
Do you have a sense of what the obesity statistic is for children in the fourth grade?

109
00:31:39,328 --> 00:31:40,508
It's less than.

110
00:31:40,588 --> 00:31:42,368
I mean, this is aggregate data.

111
00:31:42,388 --> 00:31:44,169
So I didn't pull that out.

112
00:31:46,747 --> 00:31:51,711
typically it's about a third of what the overweight data is.

113
00:31:52,972 --> 00:31:55,754
If you want that at another time, I can provide that for you.

114
00:31:55,774 --> 00:31:59,257
I would be also interested to know different grades as well.

115
00:31:59,878 --> 00:32:00,578
Oh, I have that.

116
00:32:00,999 --> 00:32:01,819
I have that here.

117
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:09,306
So grade one ranges between 32% and 34% for overweight and obese BMIs.

118
00:32:10,627 --> 00:32:11,347
Grade seven, 34% to 46%.

119
00:32:14,448 --> 00:32:15,568
40 to 47, did you say?

120
00:32:15,889 --> 00:32:17,089
Grade 7 is 34 to 46.

121
00:32:17,309 --> 00:32:17,509
Oh, 34.

122
00:32:18,909 --> 00:32:21,030
And grade 10 is 39 to 42.

123
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:28,472
The second number being female, girls, first number being boys.

124
00:32:29,653 --> 00:32:31,413
So the fourth grade has a particular problem.

125
00:32:31,493 --> 00:32:31,833
It does.

126
00:32:33,014 --> 00:32:37,495
Part of that is because grade 4, that prepubertal

127
00:32:37,976 --> 00:32:45,501
growth, just normal growth and development, that age child will develop weight prior to having a height growth.

128
00:32:46,062 --> 00:32:50,285
So that's just normally what happens to all developing, growing children.

129
00:32:51,605 --> 00:32:56,269
But it's a good time, you know, grade four is a great time.

130
00:32:56,289 --> 00:33:02,773
You have kids that are easily engaged in projects like this and starting to understand a little bit of

131
00:33:04,321 --> 00:33:11,588
peer competition and motivation and it's a good age to start promoting some kind of program like this.

132
00:33:12,488 --> 00:33:16,892
I mean, the health effects of childhood obesity are significant.

133
00:33:16,952 --> 00:33:17,473
They can be.

134
00:33:20,417 --> 00:33:32,765
For me, I think that this is a conversation I would like to have more of, if possible, especially thinking of solutions that we could do, whether it's a question of looking at our lunch program or looking at more activities for children, because these are some frightening statistics.

135
00:33:33,485 --> 00:33:34,066
Yeah.

136
00:33:34,466 --> 00:33:36,788
Our lunch program does meet all the federal guidelines.

137
00:33:37,208 --> 00:33:40,150
Well, the federal guidelines aren't very good.

138
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:44,853
20% of America's children are obese, not overweight, but obese.

139
00:33:45,873 --> 00:33:52,955
But we do look at portion control, we look at promoting healthy food, fruits and vegetables.

140
00:33:54,675 --> 00:34:01,837
There's a number of community organizations that offer some after school activity times.

141
00:34:03,857 --> 00:34:06,558
It's a population problem in our country.

142
00:34:07,458 --> 00:34:10,519
Do you think the lunch program in particular could be explored?

143
00:34:11,582 --> 00:34:14,004
Like we offer pizza every day at the high school, right?

144
00:34:14,224 --> 00:34:16,927
I'd have to have Greta Smith come in to do that.

145
00:34:17,687 --> 00:34:20,110
I mean, I would personally, if we could, find time for it.

146
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:22,331
I know we're having a busy, but if we could find time on the agenda.

147
00:34:22,832 --> 00:34:27,656
I'd really like to consider this problem, because I think we have a serious problem.

148
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:28,317
And Ms.

149
00:34:28,337 --> 00:34:32,560
Smith can address a lot of the finer details of our nutrition program with you.

150
00:34:33,601 --> 00:34:33,922
Thank you.

151
00:34:34,682 --> 00:34:35,123
Mr. Russo.

152
00:34:38,773 --> 00:34:42,475
How do our numbers compare to similar communities in Massachusetts?

153
00:34:42,775 --> 00:34:43,676
Fairly similar.

154
00:34:43,776 --> 00:34:43,996
They are.

155
00:34:44,016 --> 00:34:44,056
OK.

156
00:34:45,357 --> 00:34:45,657
Thank you.

157
00:34:46,637 --> 00:34:47,157
Unfortunate.

158
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:48,118
All right.

159
00:34:48,158 --> 00:34:49,919
Good.

160
00:34:49,959 --> 00:34:53,261
Well, thank you for getting this going so quickly.

161
00:34:53,281 --> 00:34:55,162
Thank you, Mr. Russo, for the recommendation.

162
00:34:55,182 --> 00:35:00,544
So before he's out, I'd like to request a report from the superintendent.

163
00:35:02,078 --> 00:35:04,701
complete child, the statistics broken down.

164
00:35:04,721 --> 00:35:05,021
By grade?

165
00:35:05,421 --> 00:35:08,124
Yeah, by grade, but not just overweight, but also by obesity.

166
00:35:08,825 --> 00:35:11,087
And if possible, I would like to really have a full conversation.

167
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,340
Oh, you don't do overweight?

168
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,201
It's overweight and obese.

169
00:35:15,241 --> 00:35:17,682
We don't do heights and weights on every grade.

170
00:35:17,702 --> 00:35:19,782
We do grade 1, 4, 7, and 10.

171
00:35:19,822 --> 00:35:21,043
That's what the state mandates.

172
00:35:21,163 --> 00:35:21,403
OK.

173
00:35:22,003 --> 00:35:23,724
Well, I mean, that would at least be a start.

174
00:35:23,764 --> 00:35:26,644
So you just want it broken down by overweight and obese.

175
00:35:26,804 --> 00:35:32,086
Yeah, I just want to know how many are, because the differences between overweight can be a pound.

176
00:35:32,106 --> 00:35:38,028
But obese, that means you're walking into adulthood with a one in three chance of having type 2 diabetes, right?

177
00:35:38,128 --> 00:35:39,468
I mean, it's a serious problem.

178
00:35:39,809 --> 00:35:40,969
That's a lifelong condition.

179
00:35:43,913 --> 00:35:47,838
On the motion before us, seconded by Mr. Russo.

180
00:35:48,278 --> 00:35:49,039
All those in favor?

181
00:35:49,059 --> 00:35:49,620
Aye.

182
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,441
All those opposed?

183
00:35:50,641 --> 00:35:51,342
Motion passes.

184
00:35:51,382 --> 00:35:51,762
Thank you.

185
00:35:54,425 --> 00:35:57,028
Next, report on social emotional learning.

186
00:35:57,829 --> 00:36:00,753
Stacey Shulman is going to come forward to present that report.

187
00:36:02,613 --> 00:36:03,013
Good evening.

188
00:36:03,333 --> 00:36:07,554
Good evening, Mayor Burke, Superintendent Edward Vinson, and members of the school committee.

189
00:36:07,594 --> 00:36:13,536
Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to talk about some of the social-emotional learning initiatives we have done thus far this school year.

190
00:36:14,856 --> 00:36:21,718
We have restarted the social-emotional learning committee on two levels, one with community partners as well as another with school administration.

191
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:27,520
These teams review emerging needs and how we are supporting students in the school as well as the community.

192
00:36:28,382 --> 00:36:34,665
And we hope to continue with the SEL teams in each school building to focus on their individual school communities.

193
00:36:36,346 --> 00:36:48,471
In partnership with the Board of Health, as well as the Mystic Valley Health Coalition, we have completed a survey of district administrators on social-emotional learning to provide some insight to areas of success and opportunities for growth.

194
00:36:49,509 --> 00:37:04,597
One of the notable outcomes was that 92% of respondents strongly agreed to the statements, I understand and value social-emotional learning being taught to all students, which showed an overwhelming support for continued efforts regarding social-emotional learning throughout the district.

195
00:37:06,578 --> 00:37:15,322
In partnership with Elliott Human Services, we'll be starting an evening support group for parents caring for children or teens with anxiety and or depression.

196
00:37:15,823 --> 00:37:21,525
This will begin in the coming months, and thank you to Mr. Fallon, this will be hosted in the Bistro at Medford High School.

197
00:37:23,105 --> 00:37:27,986
We've expanded the zones of regulation methodology throughout all of our elementary and middle schools.

198
00:37:28,686 --> 00:37:41,890
Adjustment counselors, school psychologists, guidance counselors, occupational therapists, and speech pathologists are supporting classroom teachers and students in learning the language to improve the ability to foster emotional control and self-regulation.

199
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:50,166
This provides a common language throughout the district, and we will continue these efforts over the next few years until all classrooms have the opportunity to participate.

200
00:37:51,607 --> 00:37:56,751
There have been a significant number of presentations for students as well as professional development for faculty.

201
00:37:57,551 --> 00:38:06,398
In October, Respond, Inc., a domestic violence prevention agency, came to speak with high school students in their health classes regarding the signs of a healthy relationship.

202
00:38:07,268 --> 00:38:16,575
This was the third year we had partnered with this agency, and we are very, very thankful of their work with our students and the generous amount of time they provided above and beyond the grant that we had received.

203
00:38:17,776 --> 00:38:33,249
The Columbus Elementary School received some training in October provided by DESE through their school SAFE program from Jason Wheeler, and this was around a supportive school environment for LBGT youth and their families.

204
00:38:35,591 --> 00:38:46,038
Counseling staff on Professional Development Day this past November 6th participated in crisis response training with the guidance of Deborah Rivlin from the Children's Room in Arlington.

205
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:57,465
This provided more information for how to support students after a crisis as well as an opportunity to consider any unique circumstances within their building and additional preparations we would need.

206
00:38:59,365 --> 00:39:06,930
We have partnered with the NAN Project through Elliott Human Services to bring mental health awareness and suicide prevention to the high school.

207
00:39:07,671 --> 00:39:13,315
On this past PD day, many of NAN Project peer mentors presented to the high school faculty.

208
00:39:14,117 --> 00:39:20,939
Debbie Helms from the Samaritans presented on the risks, signs, and responses to a student in crisis for mental health.

209
00:39:21,639 --> 00:39:31,942
In December and February, the NAN Project peer mentors will be sharing their stories with students in the health classes, as well as to provide information how they can seek mental health support within the school.

210
00:39:32,943 --> 00:39:43,566
The NAN Project will provide the opportunity for high school faculty to receive an additional training in QPR, Question, Persuade, Refer, which is an evidence-based methodology for suicide prevention.

211
00:39:44,961 --> 00:39:51,565
We will also provide this training to a select number of junior and senior students in March 2019 to enable them as peer leaders.

212
00:39:53,006 --> 00:39:58,870
Elliott Human Services will join the McGlynn faculty on December 17th to discuss mental health in the classroom.

213
00:39:59,431 --> 00:40:08,477
This will review signs and symptoms of a potential mental health challenge as well as how to support students both in the classroom as well as additional support within the school building.

214
00:40:10,307 --> 00:40:15,311
Lisa Bandoyan from the Board of Health has organized another year of risk to resiliency training.

215
00:40:16,052 --> 00:40:23,858
This professional development series consists of five trainings to faculty, and this will offer 10 PDPs, run from November to May.

216
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:28,302
We will have many more opportunities for faculty this coming year.

217
00:40:28,482 --> 00:40:37,309
We have added a new section to the Medford Public Schools website called social-emotional learning, and we will be populating that with opportunities as well as resources for faculty, staff, and students.

218
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:38,250
Thank you.

219
00:40:42,901 --> 00:40:57,300
I wondered, as you spoke about the zones of regulation, I know that the Medford Educational Foundation had received requests from different guidance counselors or whatever for signage, for

220
00:40:57,907 --> 00:40:58,487
materials.

221
00:40:58,847 --> 00:41:08,150
Have we been able to provide our students with, or each of our schools with some materials to support the zones of regulation?

222
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:14,072
We have some materials, but we're always looking for more, more posters for each of the classrooms.

223
00:41:14,112 --> 00:41:23,375
Yeah, I think that the thing was, our concern was that, well, at the time, it seemed very piecemeal, and we wanted it to be

224
00:41:25,386 --> 00:41:28,529
unified so that every school had the same sort of things.

225
00:41:28,589 --> 00:41:34,814
To be honest with you, I see that as a school initiative since we're doing this, that these are things that we should provide our classrooms.

226
00:41:35,374 --> 00:41:51,788
So I'd really like to have an opportunity to sit down and see what we've got and what in each school and what really the counselors and teachers, the principals feel is necessary in terms of some visual reminders.

227
00:41:52,649 --> 00:41:55,752
One of the items they've asked for is for assistance with color printing.

228
00:41:56,072 --> 00:42:05,521
So there are many sort of projects that classrooms can put together to learn what the different zones are, but they're by color, and the color printers are often very costly.

229
00:42:05,601 --> 00:42:10,145
So I think that was one of the items they were looking to seek, but I agree that an inventory of what we have and what we need is

230
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:11,530
is not worthy.

231
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:12,050
Right.

232
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:16,811
The foundation didn't want to fund piecemeal projects.

233
00:42:16,871 --> 00:42:23,333
It's not what we're about, so we've really been waiting for this year to see what the initiative is going to be.

234
00:42:24,553 --> 00:42:35,695
And perhaps we'll be able to support it to some degree, but only if we have an understanding that we have a comprehensive approach to it.

235
00:42:36,696 --> 00:42:37,976
Also, I just want to mention that

236
00:42:39,144 --> 00:42:48,107
Mr. Rousseau and I, Paul, we had a wonderful opportunity at the school committee conference to hear a professor from Yale speak on social emotional learning.

237
00:42:49,007 --> 00:42:50,367
I don't have his name with me today.

238
00:42:50,387 --> 00:42:59,670
I do know he's going to be doing an in-service sort of training, which was really geared for superintendents, but unfortunately it's the same

239
00:43:00,285 --> 00:43:03,586
days as your superintendent conference down on the Cape.

240
00:43:03,987 --> 00:43:07,328
But I think we should look into it and see if it's a possibility.

241
00:43:07,908 --> 00:43:09,249
He was truly inspiring.

242
00:43:09,849 --> 00:43:13,510
So it might be nice to be able to send someone from our district to go.

243
00:43:13,771 --> 00:43:16,612
Wonderful.

244
00:43:16,632 --> 00:43:16,992
Mr. Russo.

245
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:17,990
Thank you.

246
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:18,951
Thank you for the report.

247
00:43:20,572 --> 00:43:26,715
So I know that making trainings available is different than mandatory because of contracts.

248
00:43:27,535 --> 00:43:27,715
Yes.

249
00:43:28,416 --> 00:43:38,721
So for the zones of regulations, I see that we want to make it so that in the next few years, there'll be the opportunity to participate.

250
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:39,621
Yes.

251
00:43:40,362 --> 00:43:44,444
When it comes time for contract negotiations, it's good to know whether or not

252
00:43:45,075 --> 00:43:53,460
We provided the opportunity, and we provided the opportunity, and we are at 20% of people taking those opportunities versus 95%.

253
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:58,142
Because if it's 95%, we don't have to bring it into the negotiations.

254
00:43:58,622 --> 00:44:12,850
But if the school committee wants this to happen, and we provide the opportunities, and few people are taking the opportunities, then maybe during negotiations, we would decide to make that part of the contract.

255
00:44:13,518 --> 00:44:22,861
And I find that not just on this, but in several other reports, never get a sense of what was the total number of teachers that could have taken the training?

256
00:44:22,981 --> 00:44:25,122
What was the total number that actually took the training?

257
00:44:26,823 --> 00:44:32,385
And making something mandatory in part of the contract costs money.

258
00:44:33,365 --> 00:44:38,127
We don't want to add something and make it mandatory if virtually everybody's doing it voluntarily.

259
00:44:42,808 --> 00:44:54,035
don't know what it means to make the opportunity available, and from a rollout perspective, does that mean most of the teachers will have actually done it or not?

260
00:44:54,975 --> 00:45:06,262
And I'm not saying you have an answer for that, but just sort of a bit of a pontification about some of these words and how they don't give me the information I feel like I need.

261
00:45:09,052 --> 00:45:10,212
And I do have another question, though.

262
00:45:10,372 --> 00:45:11,913
I have a bunch of questions.

263
00:45:12,613 --> 00:45:16,034
The survey, 92% of the respondents strongly agreed.

264
00:45:17,474 --> 00:45:22,035
How many respondents was that, and how many possible respondents was that?

265
00:45:22,695 --> 00:45:23,336
That's a good question.

266
00:45:23,376 --> 00:45:25,636
I'll have to look into that.

267
00:45:26,376 --> 00:45:28,197
I'll just keep going with my questions.

268
00:45:30,297 --> 00:45:40,364
On the Columbus Elementary LGBTQ youth training that Desi did, which I was very happy to see, we aim to provide the training at all of our schools.

269
00:45:40,664 --> 00:45:45,708
I would be more than confident in saying that none of our schools do not have LGBTQ youth.

270
00:45:46,548 --> 00:45:52,913
So this is one of those things where having the training available at all the schools, I mean, what's the timeline?

271
00:45:52,953 --> 00:45:54,714
Are we talking like in the spring?

272
00:45:55,074 --> 00:45:56,675
Or are we talking in the next few years?

273
00:45:56,736 --> 00:45:58,317
Because all those students,

274
00:45:59,238 --> 00:46:05,984
that would benefit from this aren't getting the benefit until their teachers and the administration have been through the training.

275
00:46:08,466 --> 00:46:10,047
I don't think you have answers to these questions.

276
00:46:10,107 --> 00:46:10,407
That's okay.

277
00:46:10,707 --> 00:46:15,872
I'm sort of asking them out loud.

278
00:46:16,132 --> 00:46:22,157
The NAN project on suicide prevention, I see it says high school has been

279
00:46:22,883 --> 00:46:30,587
more than enough recent high-profile middle school suicides to make me question why we aren't doing it there.

280
00:46:30,727 --> 00:46:32,508
Yeah, so we asked the NAN project about that.

281
00:46:32,548 --> 00:46:44,594
They have not solidified a program for the middle school level, but they have graciously asked us to work with them this year to look at their curriculum on what they would be providing middle schools with the hope of rolling it out next year.

282
00:46:44,774 --> 00:46:47,916
And they would offer it to Medford for no cost, by the way.

283
00:46:47,956 --> 00:46:49,937
This is a free program they have provided to us.

284
00:46:50,417 --> 00:46:55,808
with the significant amount of staff time that they are providing for our training.

285
00:46:56,829 --> 00:46:57,611
That's awesome.

286
00:46:57,631 --> 00:46:57,932
Thank you.

287
00:47:02,688 --> 00:47:04,008
Nope, that was my last question.

288
00:47:04,549 --> 00:47:05,209
Thank you very much.

289
00:47:05,229 --> 00:47:05,509
Thank you.

290
00:47:06,329 --> 00:47:08,970
Can I just follow up with one question in your second paragraph?

291
00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:15,091
You mentioned the committees, the school emotional learning committees, and you said there are individual committees at each of the schools?

292
00:47:15,371 --> 00:47:16,192
That is the goal.

293
00:47:16,432 --> 00:47:18,532
That is the goal, so that's not in place right now?

294
00:47:18,632 --> 00:47:18,972
Not yet.

295
00:47:19,613 --> 00:47:24,734
So we have our administration that has a committee, and then we have community partners.

296
00:47:24,794 --> 00:47:26,054
Who are the community partners?

297
00:47:26,354 --> 00:47:28,035
So we're meeting with the Board of Health,

298
00:47:28,974 --> 00:47:33,538
We're hoping that the Medford Family Network will be joining us as well as Elliott Human Services.

299
00:47:34,818 --> 00:47:37,620
Okay, so we have restarted it.

300
00:47:37,761 --> 00:47:38,901
Have we restarted it?

301
00:47:39,142 --> 00:47:41,303
We've had two meetings so far.

302
00:47:41,603 --> 00:47:43,084
So we're sort of building up to it.

303
00:47:43,184 --> 00:47:48,668
I think it's really important that the teachers be involved as well, not just at the top level.

304
00:47:48,708 --> 00:47:49,449
Yes, I agree.

305
00:47:49,489 --> 00:47:54,392
Dig deep and get their input because they're dealing with the issues on the ground every day.

306
00:47:54,472 --> 00:47:56,054
So I think that's really important.

307
00:47:57,355 --> 00:47:57,615
Thank you.

308
00:47:58,652 --> 00:47:59,312
Mr. Benedetto.

309
00:47:59,652 --> 00:48:08,115
So can we get Mr. Russo's very important questions in a follow-up report in the next few weeks after these trainings have come?

310
00:48:08,455 --> 00:48:12,936
Like how many people have come, all those specific questions.

311
00:48:13,977 --> 00:48:16,597
And we can email you them if you need them.

312
00:48:16,918 --> 00:48:17,558
That would be helpful.

313
00:48:17,598 --> 00:48:18,638
Thank you.

314
00:48:18,958 --> 00:48:24,780
So that way we don't expect people to come with the answers prior to the training.

315
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:36,029
But after the training, it's really nice to have you come back and say how it went, how much participation, and if you feel like what went really well and what changes you would make for next time.

316
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:38,131
And they were very good points.

317
00:48:39,432 --> 00:48:45,517
My question was, I just want to make sure we're incorporating the Curtis Tufts program that we have here.

318
00:48:46,658 --> 00:48:48,260
We have an alternative high school program.

319
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:52,083
I would really like to see their presence at all of these trainings.

320
00:48:52,163 --> 00:48:53,564
These are experts that deal with

321
00:48:54,684 --> 00:48:58,426
children's needs all day, as well as our director of student services.

322
00:48:59,667 --> 00:49:05,551
They are experts within our district, and I think that they could bring a lot of value by their presence.

323
00:49:05,831 --> 00:49:21,480
And them going and hearing what this, whoever, all people, all parties attending, their concerns are, they also grow as educators and figure out what the needs are for the district and how to make

324
00:49:22,290 --> 00:49:24,211
our programs meet those needs.

325
00:49:24,931 --> 00:49:31,954
And it will help for pre-planning and being proactive rather than reactive about the needs within our community.

326
00:49:32,294 --> 00:49:34,315
So I strongly recommend that.

327
00:49:36,055 --> 00:49:39,057
And I motion to accept the report.

328
00:49:39,177 --> 00:49:39,517
Thank you.

329
00:49:39,537 --> 00:49:39,657
Ms.

330
00:49:39,737 --> 00:49:42,038
O'Powell, would you like to comment, if you'd like to use Ms.

331
00:49:42,098 --> 00:49:43,278
Pretz's microphone?

332
00:49:43,298 --> 00:49:43,618
Yep.

333
00:49:43,918 --> 00:49:44,219
Come on up.

334
00:49:44,259 --> 00:49:46,520
We have to get her a water bottle.

335
00:50:03,648 --> 00:50:05,849
Oh, hello.

336
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:13,314
I am a high school senior at Medford High School, and I work with several different clubs and part of it.

337
00:50:13,694 --> 00:50:18,257
And recently we've been talking a lot about mental health and mental health awareness.

338
00:50:18,958 --> 00:50:22,420
And I'm kind of curious about, you said here,

339
00:50:24,614 --> 00:50:34,139
We, on the second page, third paragraph, we said, we will also provide this training to a select member of junior and senior students in March.

340
00:50:34,639 --> 00:50:34,979
That's right.

341
00:50:35,139 --> 00:50:36,480
Will those students be from Erfurt High?

342
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:36,740
Yes.

343
00:50:37,641 --> 00:50:45,665
And around which time will you be asking students to join you for the select training?

344
00:50:46,045 --> 00:50:53,769
So we're offering the training after the peer mentors speak within the health classes, and we're figuring out those dates coming up.

345
00:50:55,673 --> 00:51:07,359
And also another question, you said here that it's working towards mental health awareness in all different parts of the schools, all different school buildings.

346
00:51:08,459 --> 00:51:12,501
Is that through QPR and Risk to Resiliency, or is that?

347
00:51:13,602 --> 00:51:17,824
So Risk to Resiliency is the faculty professional development series.

348
00:51:19,285 --> 00:51:23,707
And the NAN project is offering the QPR training to faculty

349
00:51:24,557 --> 00:51:25,738
and some students as well.

350
00:51:27,019 --> 00:51:30,721
And how are you picking the students that will receive the training?

351
00:51:31,122 --> 00:51:38,987
I think it'll be through a volunteer basis after the peer mentors present in the health classes, as well as probably some nominations for club leaders as well.

352
00:51:40,548 --> 00:51:40,928
That's all.

353
00:51:41,048 --> 00:51:41,328
Okay.

354
00:51:41,449 --> 00:51:41,629
Thank you.

355
00:51:41,649 --> 00:51:42,309
Thank you very much.

356
00:51:43,570 --> 00:51:44,270
Mr. Ruggiero.

357
00:51:44,711 --> 00:51:45,371
Thank you, Mayor Burke.

358
00:51:45,992 --> 00:51:46,792
Thank you for the report.

359
00:51:47,853 --> 00:51:50,975
I just recently finished William Dersowitch's book, Excellent Sheep.

360
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:57,424
and it talks about this idea of the raising rates of anxiety and depression among children and students in America.

361
00:51:57,985 --> 00:52:05,330
I wanted to know, do we compile statistics about reported incidences of depression in our school system?

362
00:52:06,771 --> 00:52:18,940
We have the Community That Cares survey that surveys students and asks them some questions related to this, but we do not have specific data on every student if they have been specifically diagnosed with anxiety or depression.

363
00:52:21,401 --> 00:52:35,189
So any student that has a physician-diagnosed mental health illness that comes through on a physical or as part of any ongoing case management with the nurses, we do keep that data.

364
00:52:38,661 --> 00:52:44,227
for children of a certain socioeconomic class, they might not necessarily have access to.

365
00:52:44,267 --> 00:52:52,035
I'm just curious, like, when children come in and report a scenario or report suicidal thoughts, for example, is that information recorded?

366
00:52:54,377 --> 00:53:03,185
by different burials like that gets a little bit more difficult because the school brains system doesn't, I'm not able to pull that out.

367
00:53:03,265 --> 00:53:06,107
I have to go hand by hand through every single one.

368
00:53:06,167 --> 00:53:09,851
So no, it's not broken out like that.

369
00:53:09,951 --> 00:53:12,353
But I do know the incidents of

370
00:53:13,073 --> 00:53:26,689
For example, last year in the end-of-the-year status report that goes to the Department of Public Health, district-wide we had 660 students with a physician-diagnosed mental illness.

371
00:53:28,671 --> 00:53:30,713
That's like a fourth of our students.

372
00:53:30,953 --> 00:53:32,675
No, like an eighth of our students.

373
00:53:34,557 --> 00:53:40,359
parents have the, um, they have the ability to control who knows that information and who doesn't.

374
00:53:40,839 --> 00:53:50,962
So, um, I think that's probably a smaller number than what may be out there, um, because of, you know, the parent has the discretion on whether they,

375
00:53:51,442 --> 00:53:53,123
whether they disclose that or not.

376
00:53:53,403 --> 00:53:53,623
Sure.

377
00:53:54,283 --> 00:53:55,083
Statistically, it's 20%.

378
00:53:56,044 --> 00:53:56,924
Statistically, it's 20%.

379
00:53:57,824 --> 00:54:02,326
And is that what we found with the surveys, where students self-reporting that statistic?

380
00:54:02,866 --> 00:54:05,647
On the survey, do you say, I have suicidal thoughts, for example?

381
00:54:05,667 --> 00:54:06,527
Is that on the survey?

382
00:54:09,273 --> 00:54:16,720
There is a self-report of anxiety and depression, and actually I've been working with a lot of these numbers for a grant that I'm putting together.

383
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:30,073
On the Community Care Survey from 2017, 31% of our high school and middle school students reported, self-reported having feelings of depression and anxiety.

384
00:54:30,853 --> 00:54:34,435
So there's more self-report than there is physician diagnosis.

385
00:54:34,956 --> 00:54:39,778
And do you have a sense of how that's changed over time, or is that number remaining consistent?

386
00:54:39,838 --> 00:54:41,819
I don't know how that's changed over time.

387
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:46,962
I've only looked at the most recent survey, which was 2017.

388
00:54:47,663 --> 00:54:54,967
I think it would be very helpful for me if we could look for a report, while we're doing the obesity report, if we could have sort of a health day.

389
00:54:55,373 --> 00:55:11,025
It would be interesting for me to see reports and statistics about obesity, statistics about mental health, and also statistics about drug use as well, because I would like to see sort of the many different comorbidities, I guess, of health in our system.

390
00:55:12,506 --> 00:55:14,668
I can tell you about our most recent data on that as well.

391
00:55:14,708 --> 00:55:15,208
Oh, okay, great.

392
00:55:15,789 --> 00:55:33,022
So depending on age, the high school data for tobacco use, vaping and, tobacco use, no, excuse me, vaping, marijuana, and alcohol ranges between 19% and 24%.

393
00:55:39,732 --> 00:55:42,035
Do you have a sense if children are self-medicating?

394
00:55:42,055 --> 00:55:45,199
If they're using alcohol, for example, to treat their depression?

395
00:55:45,219 --> 00:55:47,803
I assume that's a likely assumption.

396
00:55:48,304 --> 00:55:50,487
In middle school, the rates were lower.

397
00:55:50,507 --> 00:55:54,091
It was between 6% and about, I want to think, 13%.

398
00:55:55,413 --> 00:55:55,653
Yeah.

399
00:55:56,334 --> 00:55:57,775
We can compile those statistics.

400
00:55:57,875 --> 00:56:00,417
That would help get very much involved in that as well.

401
00:56:00,517 --> 00:56:08,362
To the chair, Dr. Edward-Vincent, are these statistics provided to the state versus different school systems?

402
00:56:08,382 --> 00:56:15,047
It would be interesting for me to know how Arlington is doing, how Medford's doing, how Somerville's doing, like our sister cities in the neighborhood.

403
00:56:15,947 --> 00:56:18,950
What are the health factors of those districts?

404
00:56:19,730 --> 00:56:20,871
Would they report to the state?

405
00:56:22,085 --> 00:56:26,488
Um, I'm not going to say yes, but I don't know how much of it I actually would have access to, but I'm willing to.

406
00:56:27,068 --> 00:56:36,775
So every, um, school districts that receive essential school health services grants, they have to report that, um, this data on the end of the year status reports.

407
00:56:36,835 --> 00:56:40,577
And we also report monthly data to the Department of Public Health.

408
00:56:43,515 --> 00:56:46,857
I don't know what, I mean, I don't have access to other districts' data.

409
00:56:47,877 --> 00:56:53,680
They used to compile this in a report, and I haven't seen them recently on the Department of Public Health website.

410
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:58,663
I mean, it would be interesting for me to, maybe we could request that from the Department of Education.

411
00:56:59,143 --> 00:56:59,664
Public health.

412
00:57:00,084 --> 00:57:01,385
Oh, public health or education.

413
00:57:01,425 --> 00:57:03,646
I'm not sure where the data would be compiled.

414
00:57:03,666 --> 00:57:07,408
But it would be very interesting for me to know how we're doing, and especially in regards to

415
00:57:08,312 --> 00:57:15,113
Like I said, other factors that maybe if we improved diet, we'd also help depression, help drug use as well.

416
00:57:16,634 --> 00:57:16,934
Thank you.

417
00:57:17,254 --> 00:57:17,634
Very good.

418
00:57:18,334 --> 00:57:18,994
Mr. Russo.

419
00:57:20,295 --> 00:57:29,937
Last year, I think it was in December, I attended a school committee meeting at the high school because of construction here.

420
00:57:31,137 --> 00:57:36,058
And there was a report on a survey

421
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:37,941
That was at public health.

422
00:57:38,001 --> 00:57:40,303
That was Penny that presented to the school committee.

423
00:57:40,783 --> 00:57:42,144
We had the meeting at the high schools.

424
00:57:42,184 --> 00:57:43,025
Yes.

425
00:57:43,465 --> 00:57:44,566
Is that an annual?

426
00:57:44,746 --> 00:57:44,967
Yes.

427
00:57:45,367 --> 00:57:48,890
And so will we be having that again in December or whenever?

428
00:57:49,150 --> 00:57:49,771
OK, great.

429
00:57:50,131 --> 00:57:50,471
Thank you.

430
00:57:50,952 --> 00:57:56,116
The communities that care survey is also scheduled to be conducted again February of 2019.

431
00:57:56,536 --> 00:58:01,160
So we'll be gearing up to send out those surveys again.

432
00:58:02,181 --> 00:58:02,542
Thank you.

433
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:02,922
Very good.

434
00:58:03,638 --> 00:58:08,202
Is there a motion for approval as amended by the questions that have been asked this evening?

435
00:58:08,982 --> 00:58:09,583
So moved by Ms.

436
00:58:09,603 --> 00:58:11,405
Vander Kloot, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

437
00:58:11,785 --> 00:58:12,445
All those in favor?

438
00:58:12,465 --> 00:58:12,946
Aye.

439
00:58:13,386 --> 00:58:14,087
All those opposed?

440
00:58:14,227 --> 00:58:14,867
Motion passes.

441
00:58:14,907 --> 00:58:15,588
Thank you very much.

442
00:58:15,608 --> 00:58:15,848
Thank you.

443
00:58:15,868 --> 00:58:16,229
Thank you.

444
00:58:18,931 --> 00:58:21,513
Report on Professional Development Day, November 6, 2018.

445
00:58:21,653 --> 00:58:25,496
Dr. Bernadette Rigodelli, Director of E-12.

446
00:58:37,105 --> 00:58:41,909
Good evening, Mayor Burke, Superintendent Edward Vincent, and members of the Medford School Committee.

447
00:58:42,749 --> 00:58:50,095
So I'm here tonight to give you an overview report on the first of two district-wide professional development days.

448
00:58:50,675 --> 00:58:54,198
So this professional development day occurred on Tuesday, November 6th.

449
00:58:55,178 --> 00:58:56,419
Again, it was district-wide.

450
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:58,461
The venue was varied.

451
00:58:58,561 --> 00:59:01,043
It occurred in almost every school in the district.

452
00:59:01,103 --> 00:59:06,507
I believe the only school that we did not have workshops taking place was the Roberts.

453
00:59:07,807 --> 00:59:13,051
Robert's faculty obviously were engaged in the workshops, but just not on site.

454
00:59:14,872 --> 00:59:21,357
So a majority of the teachers on the elementary level attended one of two workshops.

455
00:59:21,417 --> 00:59:29,863
So if they were K-2 teachers, they attended the RTI training workshop, which was a day-long workshop.

456
00:59:30,323 --> 00:59:35,387
If they were teachers of grades three to five, they attended the math protocols workshop.

457
00:59:36,066 --> 00:59:43,933
The Math Protocols Workshop was a Department of Ed sponsored workshop that several of us in the district, including myself, were trained on last year.

458
00:59:44,613 --> 00:59:54,482
So again, it was a protocol developed by the Department of Ed to acclimate teachers on how to best teach students with learning disabilities.

459
00:59:55,549 --> 01:00:07,838
On the secondary level, both middle and high school, most of the teachers participated in workshops in the morning that were content-related, and in the afternoon which were building-related.

460
01:00:08,478 --> 01:00:14,322
And then there were other workshops that were more specific in nature to a specific area.

461
01:00:14,742 --> 01:00:23,789
So for example, physical therapists had their workshop, occupational therapists, their workshop, speech-language pathologists had their workshop.

462
01:00:25,154 --> 01:00:35,277
A more detailed breakup of the 28 workshops that took place can be found in the packet that you were given prior to this meeting tonight.

463
01:00:36,278 --> 01:00:44,560
A really important part of what we do when we have a professional development day is to gauge how people feel about how the day went.

464
01:00:45,521 --> 01:00:52,603
So you will see in the report that we gauge their feeling by asking them five questions.

465
01:00:52,996 --> 01:00:59,279
And we also gave them an opportunity to write their own open response, which we have.

466
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:05,543
But for the purposes here, to keep it quantitative, I have the results of the following.

467
01:01:05,583 --> 01:01:07,724
So we asked these five prompt questions.

468
01:01:08,244 --> 01:01:12,747
The first was, I feel the objectives of the workshop were met.

469
01:01:13,167 --> 01:01:19,230
So on a scale of one to five, the respondents, on average, responded with a 4.7.

470
01:01:22,277 --> 01:01:26,820
The second prompt, the presenter of the workshop was or were well prepared.

471
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:29,421
So in a number of cases there was more than one presenter.

472
01:01:30,161 --> 01:01:36,925
And the mean result of that was a 4.9, again on a scale of 1 to 5.

473
01:01:37,626 --> 01:01:40,888
The third prompt, the presenter allowed enough time for questions.

474
01:01:41,388 --> 01:01:42,268
The result there was 4.8.

475
01:01:44,488 --> 01:01:48,991
The fourth prompt, I feel this program can be incorporated into my curriculum.

476
01:01:49,191 --> 01:01:50,352
That rated a 4.5.

477
01:01:51,433 --> 01:01:56,276
And then lastly, I feel that this program balanced theory and practice.

478
01:01:57,056 --> 01:01:59,158
So the mean there was a 4.6.

479
01:02:00,199 --> 01:02:05,162
So a comment was made earlier about how many respondents does this include.

480
01:02:05,622 --> 01:02:15,707
I will tell you there were about 745 respondents, keeping in mind that some teachers attended two workshops.

481
01:02:15,787 --> 01:02:19,429
So we don't have 740, I think it was 745 or 743 teachers in the district, but several attended more than one.

482
01:02:26,593 --> 01:02:35,856
To get a little bit more specific because it was raised and we talked about the non-project, there were 64 respondents for the non-projects.

483
01:02:35,896 --> 01:02:37,897
I'm just giving you specific here.

484
01:02:39,177 --> 01:02:45,540
All of the prompts for those questions occurred within a similar range to the responses that I gave you for the whole.

485
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:50,061
The lowest being a 4.2 and the highest being a 4.9.

486
01:02:50,881 --> 01:03:04,025
So I think that the responses, the response averages that you have in the report were pretty indicative of the results of the district-wide workshops.

487
01:03:07,330 --> 01:03:12,419
Many of the workshops were conducted by specialists in their field.

488
01:03:13,521 --> 01:03:20,854
Other workshops were conducted by highly trained, competent, skilled people within the district.

489
01:03:21,421 --> 01:03:23,362
So I think we had a good mix.

490
01:03:23,982 --> 01:03:29,724
Overall, anecdotally, from looking at those open response questions, we had a very good response.

491
01:03:31,365 --> 01:03:46,931
I will say that we had one teacher who told me when I was at the McGlen, and I think you shared it with Dr. Edward Vincent, that in his 12 years in the district, this was by far the best PD he had had, and I will say that was from a social studies group.

492
01:03:49,193 --> 01:03:57,099
And I know that social studies group was very, very happy, as was I. So overall, I would say it was very positive.

493
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:00,022
I am happy to answer any questions that you have.

494
01:04:00,182 --> 01:04:00,402
Ms.

495
01:04:00,442 --> 01:04:07,348
Riccadeli, did you ask for any suggestions at the end of it, if people, teachers, professionals, would like to see a certain topic covered?

496
01:04:08,109 --> 01:04:10,371
I know this is very expansive, what you did offer.

497
01:04:11,903 --> 01:04:21,852
So many of the respondents were happy that we offered a lot of content-related professional development, because that has been an issue of concern in the past.

498
01:04:23,273 --> 01:04:25,635
I think a lot of people wanted more time.

499
01:04:25,795 --> 01:04:27,837
That was a comment that came up over and over.

500
01:04:27,877 --> 01:04:31,620
They wanted more time, especially in those content-related workshops.

501
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:37,445
We try to balance it, because there are things that are really important for teachers to hear.

502
01:04:40,602 --> 01:04:43,986
For example, the non-project, that's important.

503
01:04:44,566 --> 01:04:55,598
So where teachers in the foreign language perhaps may have wanted to stay in their grammar workshop, it was important for them to get the balance of getting the non-project.

504
01:04:56,359 --> 01:05:00,163
So I think it's always kind of a struggle on how you divide your time.

505
01:05:02,470 --> 01:05:11,334
To specifically answer your question, I think more time with the content was feedback that I saw over and over in the 740 plus responses.

506
01:05:11,914 --> 01:05:12,275
Very good.

507
01:05:12,735 --> 01:05:13,395
Mr. Russo.

508
01:05:15,196 --> 01:05:18,598
Thank you for answering my first question before I asked it.

509
01:05:20,997 --> 01:05:21,837
I had a question.

510
01:05:21,857 --> 01:05:28,039
Well, first I wanted to say I was really excited to see that Teaching Pathways through the Music Curriculum was in there.

511
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:29,779
That sounds wonderful.

512
01:05:29,899 --> 01:05:35,961
And I have to assume that one was very well received based on all the other ratings.

513
01:05:36,921 --> 01:05:37,361
It was.

514
01:05:37,382 --> 01:05:38,602
And I have the ratings.

515
01:05:39,442 --> 01:05:42,103
To go through them right now, I do have them readily available.

516
01:05:42,123 --> 01:05:43,443
It was good.

517
01:05:43,683 --> 01:05:49,925
Both of the music workshops were conducted by in-district teachers who are very highly respected.

518
01:05:51,605 --> 01:06:17,746
And then my last question is, so around the curriculum review and media technology, the computer science frameworks that I see and I have actually, I think read them all, the Massachusetts ones, and I know that the federal ones put out during the Obama administration were, really they were computer science frameworks.

519
01:06:18,326 --> 01:06:20,748
And what Massachusetts adopted was this sort of

520
01:06:21,919 --> 01:06:29,683
watered down thing that Massachusetts legislature thought we could probably do something like that.

521
01:06:30,523 --> 01:06:42,749
So their computer science frameworks includes typing and using a mouse, which is not a computer science, isn't in the computer science framework.

522
01:06:43,609 --> 01:06:50,152
So I'm just wondering if we are just sticking straight to the computer science frameworks, or are we going to go above and beyond to do

523
01:06:50,992 --> 01:06:52,312
what we really should be doing?

524
01:06:53,332 --> 01:06:58,314
So with regard to the keyboarding and that, that is also found in the ELA framework.

525
01:06:58,394 --> 01:07:12,276
So in between what is expected for typing open responses in ELA as far as standardized testing and the standards.

526
01:07:12,296 --> 01:07:13,517
I think it's a mix.

527
01:07:13,917 --> 01:07:20,258
I think what you're getting at, what you're asking is, are we dealing with the higher order thinking computer science skills?

528
01:07:20,810 --> 01:07:22,431
I think there's always room for improvement.

529
01:07:22,791 --> 01:07:25,032
We are sticking with the Massachusetts frameworks.

530
01:07:27,253 --> 01:07:34,537
And I think your question really begs some more discussion with regard to that.

531
01:07:34,937 --> 01:07:35,237
OK.

532
01:07:35,457 --> 01:07:35,917
Not tonight.

533
01:07:36,337 --> 01:07:36,838
Not tonight.

534
01:07:36,858 --> 01:07:37,138
Thank you.

535
01:07:37,158 --> 01:07:38,018
I don't have the answer for you.

536
01:07:40,339 --> 01:07:41,240
Are there any other questions?

537
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:42,480
Mr. Giro?

538
01:07:43,621 --> 01:07:44,261
Yeah.

539
01:07:44,621 --> 01:07:47,863
Just like everyone else, I've attended good PD days and terrible PD days.

540
01:07:48,543 --> 01:07:50,004
How did we do last year?

541
01:07:54,146 --> 01:07:57,390
So we had two professional development days last year.

542
01:07:57,730 --> 01:08:05,339
If you remember, the second of the two was the day that we devoted to security, which I believe was February 26th.

543
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:10,245
So I'm going to go back to the one last November.

544
01:08:10,365 --> 01:08:12,127
I didn't bring the results with me.

545
01:08:12,147 --> 01:08:14,650
Yeah, that's what I was curious about, the survey response.

546
01:08:15,002 --> 01:08:21,167
So what I will say is that we did not have as many workshops as we did this time.

547
01:08:21,187 --> 01:08:22,549
So there were 28 this time.

548
01:08:22,569 --> 01:08:24,490
I don't remember offhand how many we had.

549
01:08:24,951 --> 01:08:31,296
I don't remember the responses being as rich and as good as these.

550
01:08:32,137 --> 01:08:37,982
The last time I thought we had a very positive reaction from the respondents

551
01:08:38,907 --> 01:08:45,471
was when our professional development committee helped out and we did it collectively with our professional development committee.

552
01:08:45,491 --> 01:08:47,292
So I think that was two years ago.

553
01:08:48,553 --> 01:08:51,054
So I'd have to look back to look at the numbers.

554
01:08:51,394 --> 01:08:52,995
We do keep them.

555
01:08:55,116 --> 01:08:57,097
So I think that's probably the best answer I can give you.

556
01:08:57,157 --> 01:08:57,538
That's fine.

557
01:08:57,558 --> 01:08:57,858
That's fine.

558
01:08:58,198 --> 01:09:03,641
And I wanted to know, how often does the PD committee meet the professional development committee?

559
01:09:03,661 --> 01:09:05,382
The PD committee has not met in

560
01:09:08,342 --> 01:09:09,442
I'm not sure when the last time.

561
01:09:10,023 --> 01:09:15,705
I would say it's, I think 2017 was the last time I met.

562
01:09:16,025 --> 01:09:16,265
Okay.

563
01:09:16,985 --> 01:09:23,047
And so did you pick out these workshops yourself or did you work with the superintendent to find these workshops?

564
01:09:23,207 --> 01:09:24,388
This was a group effort.

565
01:09:25,028 --> 01:09:29,950
It was the superintendent, it was Diane Caldwell, the associate superintendent, it was our directors.

566
01:09:30,030 --> 01:09:31,450
We do things collaboratively.

567
01:09:31,570 --> 01:09:33,231
I certainly cannot take

568
01:09:34,750 --> 01:09:38,351
You know, I'm not responsible for the entirety of this project.

569
01:09:39,071 --> 01:09:40,812
It really was a group effort.

570
01:09:41,252 --> 01:09:42,652
Well, thank you very much for putting it on.

571
01:09:43,653 --> 01:09:43,913
Very good.

572
01:09:43,973 --> 01:09:48,354
Is there a motion on the floor to accept this report placed on file by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Ms.

573
01:09:48,374 --> 01:09:48,854
Vander Kloot?

574
01:09:48,874 --> 01:09:49,575
All those in favor?

575
01:09:49,595 --> 01:09:49,915
Aye.

576
01:09:50,275 --> 01:09:50,915
All those opposed?

577
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:51,835
Motion passes.

578
01:09:53,636 --> 01:09:57,797
Next, report on ABCD award to Marie Cassidy.

579
01:09:57,897 --> 01:09:58,117
Ms.

580
01:09:58,177 --> 01:09:58,837
Caldwell.

581
01:10:01,258 --> 01:10:02,138
Good evening, everyone.

582
01:10:02,178 --> 01:10:03,999
I'd like to call Marie Cassidy up, please.

583
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:21,223
So most of you have already read the report that's already on the blog that Lisa Evangelista provided, and it's part of this report.

584
01:10:22,123 --> 01:10:31,587
On October 26th at the Marriott Copley Plaza Place, the 2018 ABCD Community Heroes Celebration was held.

585
01:10:32,687 --> 01:10:42,051
Our own Marie Cassidy, longtime director of Medford Family Network, was one of the 20 who received this Community Hero Award.

586
01:10:43,185 --> 01:10:45,909
For me, this is pretty exciting.

587
01:10:46,069 --> 01:10:48,912
We celebrate our kids all the time.

588
01:10:48,952 --> 01:10:49,974
We bring them to you.

589
01:10:50,855 --> 01:10:56,182
And now I get to bring you one of our own to celebrate Marie Cassidy.

590
01:10:56,642 --> 01:10:58,545
So it makes me very happy to do this.

591
01:10:59,493 --> 01:11:03,054
Marie has been director of Medford Family Network for 25 years.

592
01:11:03,875 --> 01:11:08,656
She is an advocate, tireless advocate, for our students.

593
01:11:09,357 --> 01:11:13,198
She works with community collaborations all the time.

594
01:11:13,278 --> 01:11:15,439
She supports our EL families.

595
01:11:16,079 --> 01:11:20,200
She helps families connect with resources to other communities.

596
01:11:21,721 --> 01:11:27,203
She has a summer fun program, which some people don't know, but I'll tell you in a minute how much it means to me.

597
01:11:29,104 --> 01:11:30,765
She reads stories all the time.

598
01:11:30,785 --> 01:11:36,808
You just walk by Marie's office and her rooms, and it's filled with joy.

599
01:11:36,868 --> 01:11:37,869
That's how I feel.

600
01:11:38,769 --> 01:11:40,750
So I'm going to tell you two quick stories.

601
01:11:41,410 --> 01:11:50,495
One is about an opportunity that I had to listen to a family tell their story of sadness and despair.

602
01:11:51,235 --> 01:11:57,138
This family lost their own child, and they were floundering emotionally themselves.

603
01:11:57,945 --> 01:12:00,966
They were unable to help their younger son cope.

604
01:12:02,567 --> 01:12:06,809
A friend suggested they go to see Marie Cassidy at Medford Family Network.

605
01:12:07,550 --> 01:12:10,191
Marie helped this family find their way back again.

606
01:12:11,171 --> 01:12:16,034
Counselors helped this family get strong so that they could support themselves and their son.

607
01:12:16,794 --> 01:12:26,619
Through utilization of the Medford Family Network, playgroups, parenting education programs, and the referral services, this family flourished.

608
01:12:27,527 --> 01:12:31,868
to the point that they became leaders of the Parent Advisory Board.

609
01:12:32,668 --> 01:12:42,410
And now this mother is offering a parent education program herself, paying it forward, all thanks to Marie Cassidy.

610
01:12:42,950 --> 01:12:48,331
This mother shared her story with the Children's Trust when I was at a meeting one time.

611
01:12:49,592 --> 01:12:51,232
It really touched my heart.

612
01:12:52,372 --> 01:12:54,933
But another wonderful thing that Marie Cassidy does is

613
01:12:55,995 --> 01:12:57,835
Her husband wanted to take her on vacation.

614
01:12:57,875 --> 01:12:59,996
This is really hard for Marie, because she's a worker.

615
01:13:00,096 --> 01:13:01,876
She's a workaholic, doesn't like to leave.

616
01:13:02,456 --> 01:13:05,297
So he said, I have tickets for Paris, I think it was.

617
01:13:05,937 --> 01:13:07,197
And he said, you have to go.

618
01:13:07,877 --> 01:13:13,398
So Marie asked me, she said, Diane, can you just do a play group for me at Wright's Pond?

619
01:13:13,498 --> 01:13:15,578
Well, I'm up for any kind of game.

620
01:13:16,138 --> 01:13:17,479
So I said, well, what do I have to do?

621
01:13:17,579 --> 01:13:21,339
She said, well, just show up and pick up the stuff and put it in your car.

622
01:13:21,819 --> 01:13:24,400
I had no idea what stuff Marie had.

623
01:13:26,193 --> 01:13:28,535
If you've been to her rooms, you've seen how much stuff.

624
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:32,599
So we piled, I think there were two cars filled with stuff.

625
01:13:33,099 --> 01:13:37,063
Toys, games, blankets, all kinds of stuff.

626
01:13:37,944 --> 01:13:39,285
Books, yeah, everything.

627
01:13:40,086 --> 01:13:44,890
Blocks, so the kids come to Wright's Pond and everybody's playing.

628
01:13:45,010 --> 01:13:50,075
But one of the best parts for me was the singer-dancer we had.

629
01:13:50,535 --> 01:13:58,280
that was playing games and singing and the kids were up there, but I really think I danced just as much, if not more, than those kids.

630
01:13:59,201 --> 01:14:04,104
So for me, it is my pleasure and my honor to recognize Ms.

631
01:14:04,164 --> 01:14:06,466
Marie Cassidy for all she does for us.

632
01:14:18,328 --> 01:14:21,689
Please come up here and address the audience.

633
01:14:36,127 --> 01:14:38,048
All the way up here, yes, all the way.

634
01:14:38,428 --> 01:14:46,371
The Medford Public Schools is proud to recognize Marie Cassidy for receiving the Community Hero Award signed by all of us.

635
01:14:46,471 --> 01:14:47,451
Thank you.

636
01:14:47,651 --> 01:14:48,352
It really is.

637
01:14:48,432 --> 01:14:50,032
We're so proud to know you.

638
01:14:50,552 --> 01:14:54,574
And she always puts the families and the children first, always.

639
01:14:55,294 --> 01:14:57,295
I can speak of a Rights Pond story, too.

640
01:14:57,315 --> 01:15:05,178
I don't want to embarrass her, but we were doing a night with the performances up at Rights Pond this past summer, and Marie,

641
01:15:05,978 --> 01:15:06,798
got rear-ended.

642
01:15:07,298 --> 01:15:10,459
Her car got rear-ended as she was approaching the pond.

643
01:15:11,179 --> 01:15:13,559
Does she stop, panic, go home?

644
01:15:13,619 --> 01:15:13,980
No.

645
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:17,420
She pulls her car up, the trunk's all pushed in and everything else.

646
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:18,900
All the toys were in there.

647
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,521
And she's like, don't worry about me.

648
01:15:21,541 --> 01:15:22,181
I'm fine.

649
01:15:22,241 --> 01:15:23,521
I have to get these for the kids.

650
01:15:23,561 --> 01:15:25,402
And I'm like, oh my god, I wouldn't be panicking.

651
01:15:25,462 --> 01:15:30,663
But always, everything you do, the 1,000 million lights that you put up here for your event,

652
01:15:32,383 --> 01:15:33,563
We just took them down, I think.

653
01:15:34,144 --> 01:15:35,624
But you do an amazing job.

654
01:15:35,644 --> 01:15:36,444
Thank you very much.

655
01:15:36,464 --> 01:15:38,505
And you're such a spirit in our community.

656
01:15:38,525 --> 01:15:39,585
Thank you very, very much.

657
01:15:39,605 --> 01:15:39,906
Thank you.

658
01:15:39,926 --> 01:15:41,046
Can I say a few words?

659
01:15:41,086 --> 01:15:42,246
Yes, it's all yours.

660
01:15:42,687 --> 01:15:44,407
Thank you so very, very much.

661
01:15:45,087 --> 01:15:50,549
As you know and you heard, I absolutely love the opportunity that I've been given to do this.

662
01:15:51,670 --> 01:15:54,971
I'm a born and bred MIFA girl, and I can say that.

663
01:15:55,471 --> 01:15:58,932
And I absolutely love the fact that I can give back to my community.

664
01:15:59,625 --> 01:16:18,196
And what I hope I've given to you was my years as a park instructor in Medford, as a arts and dramatic supervisor, as a teacher at the Roberts Junior High School, as a social worker, as a Head Start director, a Head Start teacher, a community development specialist for the Office for Children, and a grant writer.

665
01:16:18,216 --> 01:16:19,357
That was a really important part.

666
01:16:19,897 --> 01:16:25,861
So pulling that all together, I was given the opportunity to start this program 25 years ago.

667
01:16:28,166 --> 01:16:30,767
And I have been loving every single minute of it.

668
01:16:31,088 --> 01:16:38,511
The joys, the frustrations, the challenges, and the ever-changing Medford that we have going, right?

669
01:16:38,571 --> 01:16:39,932
It's changing all the time.

670
01:16:40,452 --> 01:16:42,753
And we have to grow and change with it.

671
01:16:43,134 --> 01:16:44,094
So I hope we've done it.

672
01:16:44,134 --> 01:16:45,535
But I have not done this alone.

673
01:16:46,235 --> 01:16:50,197
I have an amazing staff that works for me and with me.

674
01:16:50,557 --> 01:16:51,838
I have an amazing community.

675
01:16:52,830 --> 01:16:54,271
the government here in Medford.

676
01:16:54,691 --> 01:17:00,232
I have an amazing business community, organizations, the hospital.

677
01:17:01,173 --> 01:17:04,194
Collaborations and partnerships go on and on and on.

678
01:17:04,634 --> 01:17:05,954
And we continue to make them.

679
01:17:06,374 --> 01:17:07,595
And that's the beauty of this.

680
01:17:07,655 --> 01:17:13,897
We want to continually grow, never replicate or duplicate, but always give the best we can.

681
01:17:14,577 --> 01:17:16,938
And together, together, we will do this.

682
01:17:17,678 --> 01:17:20,999
Again, I want to tell you how I am blessed with an amazing staff.

683
01:17:21,537 --> 01:17:30,521
playgroup leaders, parenting educators, child care staff, outreach workers, ESOL teachers who really love what they're doing.

684
01:17:30,561 --> 01:17:32,142
We all have that kind of passion.

685
01:17:32,162 --> 01:17:39,105
And I think it reflects back to the Medford school system who opened those doors for this to happen.

686
01:17:39,605 --> 01:17:44,728
The school committee opened those doors and continue to open those doors to let it all happen.

687
01:17:45,288 --> 01:17:49,650
I want to very briefly tell you the five protective factors under which all of our

688
01:17:51,361 --> 01:17:57,003
programs, everything we do, all the fun stuff and the tough stuff are underpinned by.

689
01:17:57,823 --> 01:17:59,484
And they are social connections.

690
01:17:59,824 --> 01:18:03,125
We want to make sure our families are not isolated and alone.

691
01:18:03,566 --> 01:18:06,007
For all of our families who live or work in Medford.

692
01:18:06,987 --> 01:18:08,928
Parent resilience.

693
01:18:09,188 --> 01:18:19,352
When those tough days come, it may be next year, it may be last year, we want that bounce back factor so parents can have opportunities through me, through my staff, through our programs,

694
01:18:19,634 --> 01:18:24,115
through information and referral services to get what they need to bounce back.

695
01:18:24,515 --> 01:18:28,076
We're a child abuse prevention program as well as an education program.

696
01:18:29,116 --> 01:18:34,357
We offer child development and parenting education information.

697
01:18:34,877 --> 01:18:46,339
So we are peppered with all kinds of opportunities, single-shot programs, long-term curricula, all kinds of ways where parents continually learn how to be the best they can be.

698
01:18:47,068 --> 01:18:48,128
kids can be difficult.

699
01:18:48,409 --> 01:18:49,769
Behavior issues are everywhere.

700
01:18:50,109 --> 01:18:53,211
So how do we become better at dealing with them?

701
01:18:53,611 --> 01:18:54,311
That's what we do.

702
01:18:55,612 --> 01:18:58,253
The fourth one is concrete supports in times of need.

703
01:18:58,353 --> 01:19:06,876
You may have heard about my mitten trail for the holiday help, about my turkey trail to help our families with food support and all of that.

704
01:19:06,996 --> 01:19:09,197
That's concrete supports in times of need.

705
01:19:09,737 --> 01:19:12,618
It may be short-term, it may be long-term housing issues.

706
01:19:14,868 --> 01:19:19,831
domestic violence issues, we're there to help concrete supports in real ways.

707
01:19:20,212 --> 01:19:23,654
If we can't give it, then we'll get it for you in the best way we can.

708
01:19:24,274 --> 01:19:30,779
And the last one we spoke about a little earlier this evening is social and emotional competencies in children and adults.

709
01:19:31,159 --> 01:19:31,960
So we do that.

710
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,342
We offer all kinds of programs from birth up to age eight.

711
01:19:35,702 --> 01:19:38,464
So we get the parents in there early in the ballgame.

712
01:19:38,964 --> 01:19:42,887
And I know we need to do more of it because we haven't reached every single family yet.

713
01:19:43,577 --> 01:19:45,399
But with your help, we can continue to do that.

714
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:48,683
So I'm going to cry, but I am blessed to be here.

715
01:19:48,763 --> 01:19:50,044
I am blessed to be here.

716
01:19:50,785 --> 01:19:53,808
And to be a hero, I guess we're all heroes together, OK?

717
01:19:53,829 --> 01:19:55,611
We're all doing this together for our families.

718
01:19:55,631 --> 01:19:56,712
So thank you very much.

719
01:20:15,696 --> 01:20:19,099
Marie, other side.

720
01:20:19,139 --> 01:20:22,041
That machine's in the way.

721
01:20:54,490 --> 01:20:55,611
Congratulations.

722
01:21:02,835 --> 01:21:04,616
Is there a motion to receive this report?

723
01:21:04,696 --> 01:21:07,458
Placed it on file by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Mr. Russo.

724
01:21:07,498 --> 01:21:08,539
All those in favor?

725
01:21:08,559 --> 01:21:09,799
All those opposed?

726
01:21:09,879 --> 01:21:10,740
Motion passes.

727
01:21:12,881 --> 01:21:15,523
Report on Grade 8 Open House.

728
01:21:16,550 --> 01:21:20,832
Yes, Paul DeLava, Headmaster, and Principal Chad Collin.

729
01:21:21,932 --> 01:21:22,553
Good evening.

730
01:21:22,973 --> 01:21:29,015
Good evening, Mayor Burke, School Committee, Dr. Edouard Vincent.

731
01:21:30,856 --> 01:21:39,240
On Thursday, October 18th, from 6.30 to 8.30 p.m., the MHS and MVTHS Complex had our annual 8th grade open house.

732
01:21:40,568 --> 01:21:50,370
This year we tried to do something a little bit different than previous years, where we tried to do student-led tours throughout the building, hitting certain stations and certain spots.

733
01:21:51,671 --> 01:21:58,672
The second half of the night, which we thought would work out as well if people wanted to come later, we tried to do a self-guided tour.

734
01:21:58,713 --> 01:22:00,633
So if you entered the building, you could have got a map.

735
01:22:01,367 --> 01:22:02,507
and head in that direction.

736
01:22:02,527 --> 01:22:13,031
In an analyzation of the night, we did notice there was a lot more student-led tours than self-guided tours that were coming into the building.

737
01:22:13,992 --> 01:22:22,735
The reason why the format had changed is I'd met with a few families that were looking for a different experience than what they had before.

738
01:22:23,835 --> 01:22:34,958
Utilizing some things that I had done at the Andrews and hoping that we could do some things a little bit different up at the high school as well as the vocational school, kind of became the brainchild of this program.

739
01:22:36,299 --> 01:22:43,781
During this time, students went to designated areas, certain areas within science labs and certain areas within classrooms.

740
01:22:44,352 --> 01:22:46,793
the club fair, the gymnasium, vocational shops.

741
01:22:47,613 --> 01:22:53,514
What we came to realize is that there's a lot of stops for a short amount of time.

742
01:22:54,394 --> 01:23:05,077
Based on feedback that we asked from families after that night, I think it was a good night overall, but not everybody could get where they needed to go.

743
01:23:05,117 --> 01:23:06,997
As a matter of fact, I think we did a laudation

744
01:23:07,859 --> 01:23:19,865
When it got to the self-guided tours, we then decided to kind of invite people to break off and go into areas that they could leave their student-led tour and go into different areas of that evening.

745
01:23:21,366 --> 01:23:22,367
I did try to

746
01:23:23,367 --> 01:23:28,110
say goodnight to everybody to see as a sort of formative assessment how the night went.

747
01:23:29,551 --> 01:23:32,934
And people left pretty positive regarding this.

748
01:23:33,994 --> 01:23:37,857
We did send out the survey a little later, and again, feedback, maybe we should send it out a little earlier.

749
01:23:37,877 --> 01:23:45,222
I think I sent it out the next day, and we didn't get as many responses as I'd hoped to have gotten.

750
01:23:45,462 --> 01:23:48,524
But again, responses are good either way, so it helps us reflect on what we

751
01:23:49,277 --> 01:23:50,058
need to adapt.

752
01:23:50,318 --> 01:23:52,600
That's my end, if there's anything that you'd like to add as well.

753
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:56,103
No, just that we had our 17 programs open on the vocational side.

754
01:23:56,183 --> 01:24:04,730
We had demonstrations in five of our programs ongoing throughout the evening, so parents could see students actually working on things, live projects.

755
01:24:05,850 --> 01:24:09,614
T-shirts were being made in graphic arts, carpentry theater project, media tech.

756
01:24:09,954 --> 01:24:12,556
Everything was open, but there were certain shops that were doing demonstrations.

757
01:24:12,989 --> 01:24:14,110
It's the second year we've done that.

758
01:24:14,170 --> 01:24:15,070
So last year I tried it.

759
01:24:15,110 --> 01:24:15,731
It was a big hit.

760
01:24:15,991 --> 01:24:18,833
So each year, we'll try to rotate through a few different programs.

761
01:24:18,913 --> 01:24:21,535
Or at some point, we might have even more giving demonstrations.

762
01:24:21,575 --> 01:24:22,775
But I echo what Paul said.

763
01:24:22,795 --> 01:24:24,817
There's just not enough time.

764
01:24:25,077 --> 01:24:28,839
And it'd be great if we're going to streamline it.

765
01:24:28,859 --> 01:24:31,381
And we're going to really figure out how to do it even better next year.

766
01:24:31,401 --> 01:24:32,362
Very good.

767
01:24:32,682 --> 01:24:33,022
Thank you.

768
01:24:33,182 --> 01:24:33,883
Mr. Benedetto.

769
01:24:35,404 --> 01:24:36,324
I just had a question.

770
01:24:37,245 --> 01:24:41,007
I know in the past, you used to do two different nights, one for vocational and one

771
01:24:42,393 --> 01:24:43,154
the high school side.

772
01:24:43,214 --> 01:24:49,779
And I know since the merger that we try to combine it because it is one school with two programs.

773
01:24:50,519 --> 01:25:01,448
And I just want to make sure students that not necessarily think the high school might be for them might get that opportunity.

774
01:25:01,608 --> 01:25:09,454
And the opposite as well, students that might not have thought of the vocational programming or looking at it

775
01:25:09,905 --> 01:25:10,706
have that opportunity.

776
01:25:10,746 --> 01:25:12,707
So I do like the idea of it.

777
01:25:13,828 --> 01:25:15,869
It's just a lot to cover in one evening.

778
01:25:15,909 --> 01:25:27,697
And I just was wondering how, you know, if you're going to have another night and maybe in the spring, just because people weren't able to get around.

779
01:25:28,057 --> 01:25:32,340
So I think the challenge we run into, and there's a few challenges that go into it.

780
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:34,542
Number one, we don't want people to think that

781
01:25:35,268 --> 01:25:37,049
There's a vocational side and a high school side.

782
01:25:37,069 --> 01:25:39,671
We want everybody to know that this is now one school.

783
01:25:39,711 --> 01:25:49,317
So a lot of the reasons of doing it the same night is to kind of keep that same message that's coming across, that it's not Medford High School, it's not us, it's both of us as one.

784
01:25:50,718 --> 01:25:52,780
There's some contractual things we run into.

785
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:56,282
I will say on the high school side, that's volunteering.

786
01:25:57,043 --> 01:26:01,706
On the vocational side, that was their night of service per the contract.

787
01:26:02,436 --> 01:26:16,068
So we also run into those kinds of issues as well of trying to figure out what's going to be the contractual night of service, which as of right now, the second night of parent-teacher conference nights are going on at the high school.

788
01:26:17,089 --> 01:26:21,633
So we have to always try to divvy up the use of having people come at night.

789
01:26:22,334 --> 01:26:24,856
I'm sure a lot of people love to volunteer, and I will say that.

790
01:26:25,292 --> 01:26:26,373
A ton of people volunteered.

791
01:26:26,433 --> 01:26:27,854
That was not really the issue.

792
01:26:28,295 --> 01:26:33,679
It's, I guess, again, how do you balance so many stops and so little time?

793
01:26:36,842 --> 01:26:37,002
Ms.

794
01:26:37,022 --> 01:26:37,482
Van de Kloot.

795
01:26:38,383 --> 01:26:44,148
I did get to attend the evening, and I did find it very difficult to get around to all the different places.

796
01:26:44,268 --> 01:26:45,729
I joined a tour group.

797
01:26:46,210 --> 01:26:48,912
I will say the kids were great, and I heard

798
01:26:49,302 --> 01:26:57,790
and read in here, in your report, which is terrific, even though you didn't get that many responses, the responses you did get were very helpful.

799
01:26:58,330 --> 01:27:01,173
And many of them mentioned how terrific the tour guides were.

800
01:27:02,133 --> 01:27:05,957
But I was a little bit concerned because it did seem that it was hard

801
01:27:06,413 --> 01:27:19,220
I went back and, you know, went back to the CCSR and then it was all the way back around and it was like, whoa, this isn't, you know, and I started to see people sort of leave their tour group, which was problematical.

802
01:27:20,740 --> 01:27:23,882
The other thing is, and it's just because you're before me, I'm going to ask the question.

803
01:27:24,242 --> 01:27:30,645
In here, a couple people mentioned it was very hot and I think they were referring particularly to the vocational school.

804
01:27:31,206 --> 01:27:33,427
After that evening, I asked John McLaughlin,

805
01:27:34,224 --> 01:27:39,990
about the heat issue, and he did tell me that someone was coming in on November 6th.

806
01:27:40,450 --> 01:27:41,251
Is it better now?

807
01:27:41,891 --> 01:27:43,032
Yes, it feels better.

808
01:27:43,813 --> 01:27:44,254
Yeah, good.

809
01:27:44,914 --> 01:27:52,041
Because I haven't followed it up in any other way, you know what I'm saying, and so I just was curious how it was.

810
01:27:53,482 --> 01:27:54,063
May I respond?

811
01:27:54,263 --> 01:27:54,763
Yeah, please.

812
01:27:58,313 --> 01:28:05,436
I understand where it was problematic getting to everywhere, but I want to take note that this is the first time we've tried something like this.

813
01:28:05,476 --> 01:28:05,576
Sure.

814
01:28:05,656 --> 01:28:09,078
It will always be things that we need to improve on.

815
01:28:10,919 --> 01:28:13,241
So again, it was a brainchild.

816
01:28:13,321 --> 01:28:15,022
It was something we were going to try differently.

817
01:28:16,043 --> 01:28:30,794
Being my experience at the Andrews and knowing the feedback I received from parents in eighth grade at the time from last year, I tried to take that into account this year regarding things that were concerning on the last open house.

818
01:28:31,295 --> 01:28:34,938
So a lot of the reasons why we did the student-led tours was to kind of

819
01:28:35,938 --> 01:28:37,139
see if that would balance out.

820
01:28:37,159 --> 01:28:37,359
Sure.

821
01:28:37,819 --> 01:28:40,740
Paul, my comments aren't meant to be a criticism.

822
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:41,080
Oh, no, no, no.

823
01:28:41,100 --> 01:28:41,461
Of course not.

824
01:28:41,481 --> 01:28:50,424
It's just a question of the fact is that you've got a lot of things to showcase and, you know, it's a relatively short two hours of showcasing them.

825
01:28:51,105 --> 01:28:59,188
So I'm glad, you know, that it went as well as it did and that, you know, as you, I think it's a continual refinement process.

826
01:28:59,228 --> 01:28:59,768
Yes, absolutely.

827
01:29:00,309 --> 01:29:00,749
Absolutely.

828
01:29:01,589 --> 01:29:03,170
Do you plan another one later in the year?

829
01:29:03,985 --> 01:29:09,367
So again, we go through the challenges of the contract, which is determining what nights we can have people there.

830
01:29:09,727 --> 01:29:12,408
For us, it would be another volunteer night.

831
01:29:13,129 --> 01:29:17,831
On the vocational side, they have advisory committees as well that are contractually there.

832
01:29:17,891 --> 01:29:21,352
So it's not like we would not try not to do something like that.

833
01:29:21,532 --> 01:29:27,775
It's just, again, getting the manpower and getting the whole, everything situated again and planned out.

834
01:29:29,112 --> 01:29:38,140
And I can say too that the teachers on the vocational side, when we met after it to debrief, there are a large amount of teachers that would do something again.

835
01:29:38,680 --> 01:29:45,205
We talked about doing it on a Saturday, we talked about doing it on a Sunday for a couple hours for some of the programs to be open.

836
01:29:45,225 --> 01:29:50,510
I have to tell you, probably almost all of my teachers would come back because they're passionate, because they want to show.

837
01:29:50,930 --> 01:29:52,171
So we have a few things in the works.

838
01:29:52,211 --> 01:29:54,192
I'll be reporting to you later in the year.

839
01:29:54,292 --> 01:29:58,413
One being that when I go and visit the eighth graders, we're going to provide opportunities for them to come over.

840
01:29:58,433 --> 01:29:59,894
We're going to provide a bus.

841
01:29:59,954 --> 01:30:02,975
Anyone who's interested and wants to come over, they're going to be able to.

842
01:30:03,396 --> 01:30:05,397
It doesn't get the parents, but sometimes that's OK.

843
01:30:05,417 --> 01:30:09,618
Sometimes it's good for the students to come and experience it, get excited, and go home and talk to the parents.

844
01:30:10,699 --> 01:30:17,082
So there's going to be opportunities for them to come back in a different capacity.

845
01:30:17,662 --> 01:30:19,523
So stay tuned, because we do have some ideas.

846
01:30:20,333 --> 01:30:20,673
Excellent.

847
01:30:20,813 --> 01:30:21,213
Very good.

848
01:30:21,273 --> 01:30:21,654
Thank you.

849
01:30:22,354 --> 01:30:23,394
Mr. Benedetto.

850
01:30:24,675 --> 01:30:26,055
I'll follow up to that.

851
01:30:26,216 --> 01:30:34,659
I know that they had summer program, like a preview of different programs that the high school vocational programming offers.

852
01:30:35,119 --> 01:30:37,300
Is that going to be in the works for next summer as well?

853
01:30:37,320 --> 01:30:37,500
Yes.

854
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:39,281
And can we advertise that very early?

855
01:30:39,301 --> 01:30:45,244
Yeah, we tend to think that was advertised around March, actually, when we received it.

856
01:30:45,264 --> 01:30:47,685
Very good.

857
01:30:47,745 --> 01:30:47,925
Ms.

858
01:30:47,945 --> 01:30:48,165
Kurtz.

859
01:30:49,113 --> 01:30:50,734
Yes, I just wanted to thank you for the report.

860
01:30:51,194 --> 01:30:53,876
And I was there that night, too, with Paulette.

861
01:30:54,356 --> 01:30:59,198
And I joined a tour, and I really liked the student-guided tours and reading the survey.

862
01:30:59,298 --> 01:31:03,341
I think a lot of people did, and they liked seeing all the students in the classrooms.

863
01:31:03,881 --> 01:31:17,248
And so I was wondering, you know, some of the comments mentioned that maybe if the tours were a little bit shorter, like maybe like two minutes or three minutes instead of five minutes, and maybe could they cover,

864
01:31:18,173 --> 01:31:46,627
couple of different programs like side-by-side on one floor because I noticed that some of the tours went right by some of the programs that the kids were waiting outside and they just kind of walked right by those programs and you know I kind of felt bad and they said oh where are they going are they coming back and you know and and I know that they had to stick to their tour groups but and I know you were just trying it out for the first time this year but I did I really liked the tours because having somebody walk you around it was more

865
01:31:47,252 --> 01:31:47,862
organized.

866
01:31:48,828 --> 01:31:52,970
But I know to get through all those programs, it would take hours.

867
01:31:53,550 --> 01:31:59,252
And I will say, it's not a well thought out science, especially when you're doing it.

868
01:31:59,352 --> 01:32:03,934
When I did it at the Andrews, there are some people that are very passionate about what they're presenting.

869
01:32:04,474 --> 01:32:14,158
So the two minutes, even if you try and you prep and keep it to two minutes as best you can, you can't stifle the excitement that's what they're presenting.

870
01:32:14,178 --> 01:32:17,380
So sometimes it goes over on that end of it as well.

871
01:32:18,820 --> 01:32:22,983
Again, things in the works, I think like Chad had said, we both debriefed.

872
01:32:23,503 --> 01:32:24,644
We debriefed with staff.

873
01:32:25,564 --> 01:32:26,945
We're looking on how to improve.

874
01:32:26,965 --> 01:32:35,510
I don't think taking this format away is exactly the right way to go in my feeling, but I think there's plenty that we can adapt and improve on.

875
01:32:36,710 --> 01:32:42,913
And there was one comment that I really liked, and it talked about the cleanliness of the school.

876
01:32:43,534 --> 01:32:46,695
I was, you know, really impressed because that's something that we don't hear a lot about.

877
01:32:47,656 --> 01:32:50,777
So that was something that I was excited about.

878
01:32:50,797 --> 01:32:52,618
I'm just going to try to find it here.

879
01:32:52,638 --> 01:32:54,099
We'll thank Carolyn for that.

880
01:32:54,599 --> 01:32:55,780
Yeah, no, it was awesome.

881
01:32:55,880 --> 01:32:58,381
I was, wow, that was amazing, you know.

882
01:32:58,401 --> 01:33:00,042
Don't worry, I met them again on Friday.

883
01:33:01,723 --> 01:33:08,187
So I just wanted to, you know, I mean, I really appreciate the survey results and, you know, thank you very much, both of you.

884
01:33:08,227 --> 01:33:08,567
Thank you.

885
01:33:09,428 --> 01:33:10,128
Thank you very much.

886
01:33:10,148 --> 01:33:13,951
Is there a motion to receive this report and place on file by Ms.

887
01:33:13,971 --> 01:33:15,291
Van de Kloet, seconded by Ms.

888
01:33:15,331 --> 01:33:15,612
Kretz?

889
01:33:15,892 --> 01:33:16,772
All those in favor?

890
01:33:16,792 --> 01:33:17,273
Aye.

891
01:33:17,513 --> 01:33:18,173
All those opposed?

892
01:33:18,233 --> 01:33:19,074
Motion passes.

893
01:33:20,835 --> 01:33:22,496
And our report on Veterans Day.

894
01:33:23,056 --> 01:33:23,216
Ms.

895
01:33:23,256 --> 01:33:23,697
Chiesa?

896
01:33:25,297 --> 01:33:25,478
Yes.

897
01:33:25,518 --> 01:33:27,499
Dr. Chiesa, our Director of Humanities.

898
01:33:35,646 --> 01:33:36,746
Good evening, Mayor Burke.

899
01:33:36,826 --> 01:33:37,907
Good evening.

900
01:33:37,947 --> 01:33:41,128
Superintendent Edouard Vincent and members of the school committee, how are you?

901
01:33:42,128 --> 01:33:51,591
To commemorate Veterans Day, the Humanities Department and the Office of Veterans Services work together to sponsor the Veterans Day speaker program at the high school.

902
01:33:52,251 --> 01:34:00,834
This is the program's 18th year, and it provides high school students and faculty with the opportunity to directly interact with veterans.

903
01:34:01,434 --> 01:34:04,015
Veterans visit various high school classrooms,

904
01:34:04,485 --> 01:34:11,627
They discuss with their students combat and non-combat experiences, and it's an enormously rewarding experience.

905
01:34:12,368 --> 01:34:16,789
This year's program took place November 8th, on Thursday, November 8th.

906
01:34:17,369 --> 01:34:23,851
And again, it was co-coordinated between the Director of Veteran Services, Mr. Michael Durham, and myself.

907
01:34:24,912 --> 01:34:27,733
The day began in the superintendent's conference room at 7.30 in the morning.

908
01:34:29,157 --> 01:34:34,722
We had a breakfast of coffee and donuts that was graciously provided by the Dunkin' Donuts in West Medford.

909
01:34:35,282 --> 01:34:39,466
And we also had juice and fruit provided by food services department at the high school.

910
01:34:40,106 --> 01:34:46,231
We had a wonderful lunch also with sandwiches and various salads provided by food services department.

911
01:34:47,152 --> 01:34:55,059
As a special touch, we had Noah Kretz, a graduate of Medford Vocational Technical High School, present his exhibit of war memorabilia.

912
01:34:55,835 --> 01:35:04,858
And this was his collection that he's graciously shared with the veterans and got quite a lot of questions and a lot of enthusiasm from everybody.

913
01:35:07,379 --> 01:35:18,803
Throughout the day, on this particular day, we had 13 veterans who were from several different eras, including the Vietnam War, the Persian Gulf War, and the Iraq War.

914
01:35:19,423 --> 01:35:23,905
They visited 46 classrooms and they provided us with a wonderful overview.

915
01:35:24,822 --> 01:35:31,204
Mayor Burke and Superintendent Edward Vincent were also in attendance, so thank you both for taking the time to join us.

916
01:35:32,084 --> 01:35:38,626
And many of the veterans, I just want to add, are graduates of Medford High School and Medford Vocational Technical High School.

917
01:35:39,126 --> 01:35:41,807
And it was a really wonderful day, as it's always been.

918
01:35:43,047 --> 01:35:48,549
The students were able to get a very authentic piece of history with our veterans.

919
01:35:49,189 --> 01:35:49,709
So thank you.

920
01:35:50,680 --> 01:35:51,080
Thank you.

921
01:35:51,381 --> 01:35:51,701
Thank you.

922
01:35:51,881 --> 01:36:01,448
It was also an opportunity for Lieutenant Durham, who's our new veterans service director, to meet a lot of our veterans in our city, as well as the students and teachers at Medford High School.

923
01:36:02,209 --> 01:36:03,310
I know it was a great day.

924
01:36:03,470 --> 01:36:06,532
And many of our police officers are veterans, and they participated as well.

925
01:36:06,572 --> 01:36:09,014
So it was a great showing, I think, from the community at large.

926
01:36:09,454 --> 01:36:09,975
It was wonderful.

927
01:36:09,995 --> 01:36:15,159
To really hit home how important it is, and what they had to endure, and their families as well.

928
01:36:15,439 --> 01:36:15,679
Yes.

929
01:36:15,799 --> 01:36:16,640
And if I might add.

930
01:36:17,656 --> 01:36:19,237
Mr. Durham was amazing.

931
01:36:19,277 --> 01:36:20,618
Working with him is his first year.

932
01:36:20,658 --> 01:36:23,400
And he hit the ground running.

933
01:36:23,420 --> 01:36:26,041
And he did a great job when we worked closely together.

934
01:36:26,081 --> 01:36:29,383
And a lot of the veterans, they give up their day to come.

935
01:36:29,784 --> 01:36:32,685
Most of them came and spent the whole day with us.

936
01:36:32,725 --> 01:36:36,688
A lot of them are working the night shift if they're a police officer later in the day.

937
01:36:36,728 --> 01:36:41,971
And they really very graciously spent time with the students and very much appreciate it.

938
01:36:45,633 --> 01:36:45,993
Thank you.

939
01:36:46,173 --> 01:36:46,834
We have a question.

940
01:36:51,838 --> 01:36:56,805
I don't have a question but more like a statement.

941
01:36:57,806 --> 01:37:02,653
So I came to Medford High in February and I've been to three different high schools overall.

942
01:37:03,187 --> 01:37:05,669
And Veterans Day has always been very mundane.

943
01:37:05,689 --> 01:37:06,569
You don't really do much.

944
01:37:06,610 --> 01:37:10,172
Maybe you have a veteran's drive, but that's very separate from the regular school day.

945
01:37:10,792 --> 01:37:21,220
So the first time seeing veterans come to school and having them involved and having people ask questions, and I had a lot of friends and peers talk to me about

946
01:37:22,140 --> 01:37:23,301
veterans coming to their classes.

947
01:37:23,341 --> 01:37:39,350
I didn't have one in my class for separate reasons, but I thought it was just a very awesome thing to see, and it was very nice to see how they related back, and how the teachers talked about it, and I thought it was very meaningful to the veterans and other people, and it seems very sincere, so thank you for that.

948
01:37:39,675 --> 01:37:40,575
Thank you for saying that.

949
01:37:40,615 --> 01:37:41,496
Thank you very much.

950
01:37:41,576 --> 01:37:42,516
We appreciate that.

951
01:37:42,536 --> 01:37:43,956
Thank you for sharing that with us.

952
01:37:43,996 --> 01:37:44,657
Thank you.

953
01:37:44,697 --> 01:37:45,377
Nice job.

954
01:37:45,397 --> 01:37:48,958
Is there a motion to receive this report and place it on file?

955
01:37:48,998 --> 01:37:49,198
Yes.

956
01:37:49,218 --> 01:37:51,039
Moved by Mr. Rousseau, seconded by Ms.

957
01:37:51,079 --> 01:37:51,559
Vanden Heuvel.

958
01:37:51,579 --> 01:37:52,359
All those in favor?

959
01:37:52,379 --> 01:37:52,439
Aye.

960
01:37:53,080 --> 01:37:53,700
All those opposed?

961
01:37:53,780 --> 01:37:54,680
Motion passes.

962
01:37:55,160 --> 01:37:55,440
Thank you.

963
01:37:55,460 --> 01:38:02,783
The next item is negotiations and legal matters, which is there a motion to move this paper out of order to put to the end of the docket?

964
01:38:04,580 --> 01:38:05,281
There's a motion by Ms.

965
01:38:05,301 --> 01:38:06,962
VanCleef, seconded by Mr. Russo.

966
01:38:06,982 --> 01:38:07,702
All those in favor?

967
01:38:07,963 --> 01:38:08,063
Aye.

968
01:38:08,303 --> 01:38:08,963
All those opposed?

969
01:38:09,023 --> 01:38:09,744
Motion has it.

970
01:38:12,466 --> 01:38:13,107
New business.

971
01:38:13,327 --> 01:38:31,081
Whereas community participation is critical to a well-functioning school system, and whereas many parents find evenings difficult to arrange child care so that they can attend scheduled meetings, therefore be it resolved that the school committee schedule community participation meetings on two Saturday afternoons every year

972
01:38:31,761 --> 01:38:36,687
Through participation with parent-teacher groups, child care and entertainment will be made available to parents.

973
01:38:37,287 --> 01:38:44,235
In addition to school committee activities, other school volunteer groups will post opportunities for further parent engagement.

974
01:38:44,556 --> 01:38:52,125
The dates of these events will be determined at the convenience of the superintendent of schools, Mr. Ruggiero, the author of this item.

975
01:38:52,747 --> 01:38:57,210
Yet when I decided to run for school committee, one main question motivated me.

976
01:38:58,011 --> 01:39:08,998
Simply stated, I wondered, with over 4,000 students and $58 million in assets, why are most school committee meetings so poorly attended by parents?

977
01:39:09,999 --> 01:39:13,501
Before I ran, I feared that it is as they say on TV.

978
01:39:13,902 --> 01:39:18,405
People were simply disinterested and disengaged in local politics.

979
01:39:19,356 --> 01:39:24,661
But knocking on thousands of doors, a passion and brilliance drove me to continue.

980
01:39:25,122 --> 01:39:28,545
After a few months, an obvious answer arose.

981
01:39:29,306 --> 01:39:30,186
It was our timing.

982
01:39:31,408 --> 01:39:35,371
People have amazing energy and ideas to help drive our schools forward.

983
01:39:35,912 --> 01:39:43,119
But 7 o'clock on a Monday is a challenging, if not almost impossible time for many parents to voice their opinions.

984
01:39:44,820 --> 01:39:51,484
Dozens of parents have voiced support for a biannual weekend meeting such as I have proposed.

985
01:39:52,504 --> 01:40:04,851
But tonight's meeting time came into conflict with, and these are real responses I got from tonight, late night work schedules that just came up, the parent-teacher conference that are coming up, bedtimes, family dinner.

986
01:40:05,591 --> 01:40:09,273
Thus, I suggest we hold a meeting when parents can attend.

987
01:40:10,535 --> 01:40:16,682
As you can hear in the resolution, I suggest two meetings held on perhaps a Saturday afternoon every year.

988
01:40:18,144 --> 01:40:27,115
I propose we create an idea fair of sorts on important topics such as addressing our budget or energizing after school activities.

989
01:40:27,703 --> 01:40:37,767
The goals and themes of these meetings can be chosen by our committee and our superintendent to ensure that we are generating momentum to projects that we already have in the works.

990
01:40:38,727 --> 01:40:46,290
But I hope that we can really move forward real school committee meetings, where great ideas can begin to get some action.

991
01:40:46,891 --> 01:40:53,893
Additionally, I would like to invite Corey Check members of the PTO to help with child care, entertainment, and food during the event.

992
01:40:54,554 --> 01:40:55,374
With these amenities,

993
01:40:55,935 --> 01:41:00,098
busy parents don't have to wrestle dinner or childcare for frisky kids.

994
01:41:00,878 --> 01:41:04,281
Personally, I would love to see these events catered by our new bistro.

995
01:41:04,801 --> 01:41:12,506
But most importantly, I would like volunteer groups and PTOs associated with our schools to advertise opportunities for people to contribute.

996
01:41:13,647 --> 01:41:21,653
Clay Shirky coined the phrase cognitive surplus to describe the untapped energy and talent people have available after work.

997
01:41:22,533 --> 01:41:23,474
I honestly believe

998
01:41:24,062 --> 01:41:30,910
that the city of Medford contains hundreds of scientists that would love to open up and help out with STEM students.

999
01:41:31,410 --> 01:41:33,552
Hundreds of artists ready to inspire.

1000
01:41:33,693 --> 01:41:43,043
Dozens of CEO dads and professor moms ready to open up their business and labs, if only asked at a time when they aren't at work or tucking in their kids.

1001
01:41:44,157 --> 01:41:49,438
Before we open the floor, I want to acknowledge that I've left a lot of the details and dates of these meetings open to discussion.

1002
01:41:50,098 --> 01:41:55,720
I know that our superintendent has to work out the details, and I hope to work with her as we move forward.

1003
01:41:56,500 --> 01:42:01,701
Seeing that we are almost up to Christmas, perhaps only one meeting this year is possible.

1004
01:42:03,282 --> 01:42:10,984
But I'm really excited about this proposal, and I can assure you many, many parents feel like that this would be a great addition to our school system.

1005
01:42:11,204 --> 01:42:11,624
So thank you.

1006
01:42:13,013 --> 01:42:13,393
Thank you.

1007
01:42:13,614 --> 01:42:15,015
On the motion, Mr. Russo.

1008
01:42:16,116 --> 01:42:18,097
Thank you.

1009
01:42:18,738 --> 01:42:24,463
My question is, have you looked to see if other communities have done something along this line and their success?

1010
01:42:25,264 --> 01:42:27,025
I've done a little broad research.

1011
01:42:27,045 --> 01:42:29,768
I know that some private schools have done it in the past.

1012
01:42:29,788 --> 01:42:34,592
When I was a teacher, private schools would hold a weekend open house backslash.

1013
01:42:37,635 --> 01:42:51,480
I don't know how many Massachusetts districts do this, but I do believe, once again, that if we give it a shot, we can maybe pilot something in Massachusetts.

1014
01:42:52,100 --> 01:43:00,243
And I just want to make it, when I read this, I do not see that this is a school committee meeting.

1015
01:43:00,983 --> 01:43:05,765
We will not deliberate, we won't have to have a quorum,

1016
01:43:06,777 --> 01:43:18,101
the whole thing has to disband, or is this a school committee meeting you want to have where we take votes and there's roll call and somebody doesn't show up and the whole thing's over because we didn't have a quorum.

1017
01:43:19,302 --> 01:43:23,743
So I just want to be clear which one you think.

1018
01:43:25,844 --> 01:43:28,705
Yes, all the people that would be involved, yes.

1019
01:43:28,725 --> 01:43:32,467
I mean, this is something that we can leave open to debate as well.

1020
01:43:34,460 --> 01:43:52,485
But is it possible for us to have an official meeting where we're not following Robert's rules and therefore making it a very not

1021
01:44:02,609 --> 01:44:08,534
We would have, if I could interject, if it's a school committee meeting held on another day, it would be just like this.

1022
01:44:08,875 --> 01:44:10,316
It would have to be like this.

1023
01:44:10,977 --> 01:44:21,306
It wouldn't be like an open house, which a private school that doesn't have a school committee would offer where they want to show off their school, which is what they just did a few nights ago.

1024
01:44:21,974 --> 01:44:24,376
That's very different than a committee meeting.

1025
01:44:24,536 --> 01:44:35,225
And I guess that's where I'm trying to really get at is because I've had conversations with Mr. Ruggiero and others about how this isn't a dinner table.

1026
01:44:36,426 --> 01:44:46,134
And there's nothing physically or operationally we can do to make this feel like anything other than it is.

1027
01:44:46,154 --> 01:44:50,977
If I could inject a point, there's no reason that we could have a recess for 15 minutes

1028
01:44:52,172 --> 01:44:58,895
And I think that's a really good point and I think that's a really good point.

1029
01:45:12,937 --> 01:45:17,560
Some of the rules are just have a recess and just have a listening session as well, where we're all present.

1030
01:45:18,161 --> 01:45:26,546
But if we do deliberate, if we do make decisions, yes, we would have to reform the committee or after a recess period.

1031
01:45:26,806 --> 01:45:28,027
Are you all set, Mr. Rizzo?

1032
01:45:28,067 --> 01:45:28,167
Ms.

1033
01:45:28,187 --> 01:45:28,528
Stone.

1034
01:45:30,489 --> 01:45:32,310
I appreciate you wanting parents to get here.

1035
01:45:32,690 --> 01:45:39,055
I'd love to see parents here often, but like most of us, we do also have kids with bedtimes and feeding dinner.

1036
01:45:41,466 --> 01:45:49,553
We have eight subcommittees that I think if a parent has a real concern about an issue, we've all been emailed on that issue.

1037
01:45:49,993 --> 01:45:59,121
And most of the time, if it's an issue that a number of parents are concerned with, it does get addressed at a subcommittee, whether it's buildings and grounds, community relations, curriculum, special ed.

1038
01:45:59,862 --> 01:46:07,968
So if we only book this twice a year, the concern that might bring a parent out might not even be on the agenda for those two meetings a year.

1039
01:46:08,189 --> 01:46:09,630
So I'm not sure if this would really

1040
01:46:10,508 --> 01:46:11,469
get parents here.

1041
01:46:11,729 --> 01:46:21,655
I think a meeting open to parents, like the community relations where parents have an actual concern about relations, they can come to the subcommittee meeting.

1042
01:46:22,035 --> 01:46:37,165
Or if it's a concern about class size, we can bring it to curriculum and talk to the parents who are very concerned and make a time for them that works for them to get there, whether it's at 4 o'clock on a Wednesday or, you know, 7 o'clock on a Thursday night.

1043
01:46:37,245 --> 01:46:39,827
I just, having two meetings a year,

1044
01:46:40,660 --> 01:46:44,583
That doesn't mean their issue is going to fall on the agenda for those two meetings.

1045
01:46:44,923 --> 01:46:45,283
Sure.

1046
01:46:45,964 --> 01:46:51,848
I would like to suggest that we have a system, a way of thinking about it.

1047
01:46:51,888 --> 01:46:52,108
Yeah.

1048
01:46:52,128 --> 01:46:55,351
If something goes wrong, and it's really bad, all the parents show up.

1049
01:46:56,031 --> 01:47:00,314
Wouldn't it be great if the system was, let's actually work together on making something right?

1050
01:47:00,334 --> 01:47:07,139
A more proactive response in how we plan the policies of our schools.

1051
01:47:09,130 --> 01:47:12,212
I feel like parents have reached out to all of us.

1052
01:47:12,353 --> 01:47:21,279
I'm sure we all have solid problems that people have reached out that we've all done solutions.

1053
01:47:35,622 --> 01:47:41,785
whether it's going to the high school for TLC with Mr. DeLava or doing a walk audit on Salem Street for parents at the Roberts.

1054
01:47:41,865 --> 01:47:46,066
I know everyone here has done projects specific to parents who've reached out.

1055
01:47:46,527 --> 01:47:53,590
So I haven't heard from parents saying that they haven't been heard or there's an issue that they would have come if it wasn't on a Monday night at 7.

1056
01:47:54,310 --> 01:47:58,792
Maybe it's different parent group than I'm speaking with than you are speaking with.

1057
01:47:59,192 --> 01:48:01,153
But I haven't yet heard a parent say, Mia,

1058
01:48:01,708 --> 01:48:06,692
We need a meeting on a Saturday because the school committee is not hearing us or not addressing something that we've brought to your attention.

1059
01:48:06,712 --> 01:48:18,340
Once again, like I said, I don't think that the question is, oh, there's some terrible thing that we're just not doing, per se, like a slide that needs to be prepared.

1060
01:48:18,380 --> 01:48:27,047
I think the issue is more inviting people that have a resource available that they might be able to provide.

1061
01:48:27,067 --> 01:48:29,569
And by creating a time when they can actually attend,

1062
01:48:30,179 --> 01:48:38,044
they can actually begin to engage with the community and try to figure out how they can fit that resource into the needs of our schools.

1063
01:48:38,625 --> 01:48:39,165
Are you all set?

1064
01:48:39,705 --> 01:48:42,987
Yeah, I think we'll agree to disagree, at least on my side.

1065
01:48:43,007 --> 01:48:43,047
Ms.

1066
01:48:43,588 --> 01:48:43,828
Krutz?

1067
01:48:44,128 --> 01:48:45,529
Yes, so I have a question.

1068
01:48:45,889 --> 01:48:57,797
Did we conduct any surveys with the community, like an online survey asking them, you know, would they come to a school committee meeting on a Saturday?

1069
01:48:59,909 --> 01:49:03,430
We already have the calendar set for the year already, for the whole school year.

1070
01:49:03,991 --> 01:49:18,496
And then contractually with the administrators that come and present, you know, can we, can they come and mandate, like we would actually have to, you know, mandate them to, you know, they work Monday through Friday, you know, late into the evening.

1071
01:49:18,556 --> 01:49:21,017
They're away from their families all week, all night.

1072
01:49:21,437 --> 01:49:24,778
And now we're going to have them, I'm sorry, you've got to be away from your family one more time.

1073
01:49:25,098 --> 01:49:27,059
because we need you to come in on a Saturday.

1074
01:49:27,399 --> 01:49:32,781
I mean, I'm just... Has anybody asked the administration, like, what are their thoughts or views, you know?

1075
01:49:33,641 --> 01:49:45,586
Before we just jump right in and making a decision that we're going to have meetings on Saturdays, I was just curious what was done behind the scenes, because I haven't received any inquiries from parents asking to have a Saturday meeting either.

1076
01:49:45,826 --> 01:49:48,207
So it came to me as, what is this all about?

1077
01:49:48,307 --> 01:49:48,747
I didn't know.

1078
01:49:48,927 --> 01:49:53,969
I was confused because it was almost the message we got was mentioning that

1079
01:49:54,565 --> 01:49:57,966
there was a lot of communication between school committee members.

1080
01:49:58,046 --> 01:50:03,247
And I was just wondering who, because I haven't been communicating on it or receiving messages myself.

1081
01:50:03,307 --> 01:50:10,889
And I just, it brought up more questions, for example, sports and church, you know, athlete dancing and band.

1082
01:50:10,949 --> 01:50:15,991
And those are going to be other reasons why parents can't come to the Saturday school committee meeting.

1083
01:50:16,231 --> 01:50:19,712
Weddings, communions, birthdays, like it just goes on and on.

1084
01:50:19,772 --> 01:50:23,733
Like there's more events on the weekends, Saturdays especially,

1085
01:50:24,251 --> 01:50:25,832
doctor's appointments, dentist appointments.

1086
01:50:25,872 --> 01:50:30,074
I know I tend to put my dentist appointments on Saturdays, you know, and a lot of families might.

1087
01:50:30,395 --> 01:50:35,938
I mean, there's like, there's equally amount of reasons to have it on a Saturday, not have it on a Saturday.

1088
01:50:36,018 --> 01:50:44,083
You know, it's just, I'm thinking maybe we should do a survey before we jump into making any decisions, and that's what I'm thinking.

1089
01:50:44,623 --> 01:50:46,184
Mr. Benedetto, and then Ms.

1090
01:50:46,204 --> 01:50:46,684
Van de Kloot.

1091
01:50:47,465 --> 01:50:47,765
Thank you.

1092
01:50:48,916 --> 01:51:10,919
So I really think that my colleague is trying to do is have like a brainstorming, meet the school committee, bring your talent and your ideas for us, like maybe a goal setting meeting with the school committee present, like to hear what the community thinks are priorities.

1093
01:51:11,352 --> 01:51:28,147
thinks ways that they can join the school committee in different ways, the school department in different ways and be helpful, active participants in the school community as a whole as opposed to having a more formal meeting.

1094
01:51:28,547 --> 01:51:31,430
If I'm hearing you correctly from what I'm hearing.

1095
01:51:33,172 --> 01:51:48,099
And I think he's looking for an opportunity to have a way for people to access, to have access to us as a committee and to just like volunteer and give us ideas and priorities and like dialogue.

1096
01:51:48,799 --> 01:51:53,241
More so than like an official meeting with administrators and

1097
01:51:54,890 --> 01:51:57,311
That, is that what, am I hearing correctly?

1098
01:51:57,391 --> 01:51:58,952
Is that more what you're looking for?

1099
01:51:58,972 --> 01:52:02,014
I need some clarity on that.

1100
01:52:14,280 --> 01:52:24,625
Community participation throughout the district in ways that parents and, you know, community participation and involvement

1101
01:52:25,647 --> 01:52:28,029
both with the school department and the school committee.

1102
01:52:28,330 --> 01:52:39,161
It's just to open it up, to hear the voices of the people in our community and to meet them and to see what they have to offer and what they'd like to do and what they see our future as.

1103
01:52:40,442 --> 01:52:44,106
At least that's what I'm hearing and I could be off base.

1104
01:52:44,466 --> 01:52:47,229
I don't know if my colleague wants to clarify a little bit more.

1105
01:52:54,061 --> 01:52:56,423
Dozens of parents have expressed this opinion to me.

1106
01:52:56,443 --> 01:52:57,764
I do an official survey.

1107
01:52:57,784 --> 01:52:58,885
This is unscientific.

1108
01:52:58,905 --> 01:53:00,306
We mis-explained it.

1109
01:53:02,068 --> 01:53:03,429
Monday at 7 is a tough time.

1110
01:53:03,549 --> 01:53:06,471
Yeah, there's always going to be issues on the weekend as well.

1111
01:53:06,571 --> 01:53:10,574
So some parents, they get told that Monday we may not be able to go on Saturday.

1112
01:53:10,655 --> 01:53:22,884
But I do believe that if we create an event atmosphere, we create like child care or a movie that we project, create something that's more fun as well.

1113
01:53:24,020 --> 01:53:29,281
there's child care in the environment, maybe ice cream, that could also provide incentives.

1114
01:53:29,722 --> 01:53:33,323
That happens at other events that we're all, that we're at.

1115
01:53:33,403 --> 01:53:33,543
Ms.

1116
01:53:33,563 --> 01:53:34,463
Van de Kloot, I'm sorry.

1117
01:53:34,483 --> 01:53:34,643
Right.

1118
01:53:34,903 --> 01:53:38,524
So, Michael, I've been thinking about this a lot in different ways.

1119
01:53:39,224 --> 01:53:48,907
One of the things, as soon as you just said ice cream, one of the things that I was thinking about is, and I think there are some things that you haven't really been able to participate in yet,

1120
01:53:49,687 --> 01:54:02,792
So, for example, having a formal meeting and having all of this sort of information fair and volunteer fair and child care and entertainment seems at odds.

1121
01:54:03,012 --> 01:54:06,853
They don't seem to fit together for me in terms.

1122
01:54:07,354 --> 01:54:08,054
I'm not sure

1123
01:54:09,144 --> 01:54:09,804
what the value is.

1124
01:54:09,844 --> 01:54:14,607
But there is always value, always valuable being accessible to constituents.

1125
01:54:15,327 --> 01:54:22,451
So part of the thing that many of us have done is, for example, in February, the MFN hosts the Ice Cream Social.

1126
01:54:22,551 --> 01:54:23,952
It's a Saturday afternoon.

1127
01:54:24,572 --> 01:54:32,276
And I was trying to say to myself, OK, so one piece, for example, is most often, certainly many of us are there.

1128
01:54:32,876 --> 01:54:34,557
Maybe what we should do is start

1129
01:54:36,538 --> 01:54:44,825
45 minutes early or something and have an opportunity, meet the school committee members before we go and serve ice cream.

1130
01:54:44,845 --> 01:54:46,286
Because we always go serve ice cream.

1131
01:54:46,566 --> 01:54:52,811
Frankly, it's a great time to meet and interact with community members and their kids.

1132
01:54:53,812 --> 01:54:54,633
And it's a lot of fun.

1133
01:54:55,153 --> 01:55:01,198
But maybe there's a way to formalize a little piece of that so that there's a session beforehand or

1134
01:55:02,178 --> 01:55:03,519
you know, we have our job to do.

1135
01:55:04,099 --> 01:55:09,960
And of course, you have to be careful because you don't want to compete with the magician, okay?

1136
01:55:10,240 --> 01:55:11,081
So that's one way.

1137
01:55:11,621 --> 01:55:19,343
Another thing that we used to have was an evening with the superintendent, which the school committee members tended to show up at.

1138
01:55:19,823 --> 01:55:26,205
And for a while, there was a period of time when we actually got a pretty good response.

1139
01:55:27,105 --> 01:55:53,247
It was an opportunity then for the superintendent, and I might say, if we might say, an evening with the superintendent and school committee members for the community to come to hear the initiatives of the superintendent and school committee so that it was sort of understanding what the vision was of the body and doing something which was targeted

1140
01:55:54,363 --> 01:56:06,389
I think the question that, and we've discussed volunteer work in the community engagement subcommittee has talked about volunteer work, to me that almost feels separate.

1141
01:56:06,409 --> 01:56:09,871
Or we have a health fair that happens on Saturday.

1142
01:56:10,331 --> 01:56:17,015
And the health fair would be, if you were to think about health care and volunteering, we already have an event.

1143
01:56:17,835 --> 01:56:28,599
it's well attended, that we could combine a piece where the school committee members are present at that and we might set up other school activities to bring in that piece.

1144
01:56:29,919 --> 01:56:44,924
As your resolution stands, I can't support it because I think that it's not focused enough to be valuable because it's going to be an awful lot of work.

1145
01:56:45,815 --> 01:56:49,838
to create that event and wondering whether it will work.

1146
01:56:50,258 --> 01:57:05,470
But to take your idea and say, which I think certainly has value, and to take a look at different pieces of it and say, how do we accomplish what you want to accomplish in existing venues which we could expand?

1147
01:57:08,452 --> 01:57:12,294
without creating so much work, I think has value.

1148
01:57:12,874 --> 01:57:26,380
So right now, rather than vote on it, I think the interesting thing is I think it should go back to the Community Engagement Subcommittee and that that would be

1149
01:57:27,040 --> 01:57:38,968
the place to kind of sort out and to identify ways that we could work on this objective without going to one Saturday event.

1150
01:57:39,408 --> 01:57:52,916
Now, the other piece of it, which I've mentioned to you just a little bit, I do think that one other thing that we might look at, maybe it comes at the same time when we do a superintendent thing, is helping inform the committee a little bit more about our budget.

1151
01:57:53,216 --> 01:57:54,317
So, just another piece.

1152
01:57:54,749 --> 01:57:55,970
Are you making a motion to send it?

1153
01:57:55,990 --> 01:57:57,970
So I'm making a motion to send it to subcommittee.

1154
01:57:58,310 --> 01:58:02,692
Is there a second on the floor to send it to the subcommittee to work out some of the details?

1155
01:58:02,712 --> 01:58:03,653
There's a second by Ms.

1156
01:58:03,693 --> 01:58:04,013
Kretz.

1157
01:58:04,753 --> 01:58:05,593
All those in favor?

1158
01:58:05,613 --> 01:58:06,494
Aye.

1159
01:58:07,014 --> 01:58:07,814
All those opposed?

1160
01:58:09,735 --> 01:58:10,435
Motion carries.

1161
01:58:14,997 --> 01:58:16,558
Also, we have

1162
01:58:18,590 --> 01:58:25,693
We'd like to send our sincere condolences to the family of Ernest Ernie Lorenz, who was of Pinnacle, New Hampshire.

1163
01:58:26,453 --> 01:58:34,977
Prior to his retirement in 1991, he worked as a custodian for the city of Medford for 18 years, and he also had worked for the Hudson bus lines.

1164
01:58:36,257 --> 01:58:44,961
Likewise, to the family of Mary Bullen, mother of Janet Ricardo, former Medford Public Schools secretary, and her husband Matthew Ricardo, former Medford Public Schools custodian.

1165
01:58:45,418 --> 01:58:53,762
the grandmother of Michelle Bissell, who we all know works for Diane, executive assistant to the associate superintendent and her husband John, M.H.S.

1166
01:58:53,822 --> 01:58:58,824
maintenance, and great-grandmother to Janelle DeSanto, kindergarten teacher at the Brooks Elementary School.

1167
01:58:59,404 --> 01:59:02,506
If we could rise for a moment of silence on the passing of these two individuals.

1168
01:59:15,125 --> 01:59:15,525
Ms.

1169
01:59:15,545 --> 01:59:16,166
DiBenedetto.

1170
01:59:17,907 --> 01:59:18,928
We're not ready to adjourn.

1171
01:59:18,968 --> 01:59:19,969
We still have negotiations.

1172
01:59:20,129 --> 01:59:20,789
Oh, yeah.

1173
01:59:20,829 --> 01:59:25,933
Before we move to executive session, could we just go over the requested reports?

1174
01:59:25,974 --> 01:59:27,395
I think we've received some of them.

1175
01:59:27,475 --> 01:59:32,579
And just make sure that the list is.

1176
01:59:32,599 --> 01:59:35,541
The first item is the status of PTO registration form, 10118.

1177
01:59:37,523 --> 01:59:44,188
If we could get an update of where we are on that in the next few weeks or early January, that would be great.

1178
01:59:45,652 --> 01:59:52,158
The status of the safety report has come to our attention that they have individual reports for each of the schools.

1179
01:59:52,599 --> 01:59:54,140
We have not received those yet.

1180
01:59:54,180 --> 02:00:03,129
As soon as they are received, we will schedule a committee meeting to discuss them in a high level fashion because they are deemed emergency management documents.

1181
02:00:03,229 --> 02:00:09,495
So the documents will not be distributed to members of the committee or the public, obviously.

1182
02:00:09,999 --> 02:00:13,240
But it will be highlighted narrative that will be delivered to us.

1183
02:00:13,440 --> 02:00:15,501
Will we receive one big report with every school?

1184
02:00:15,521 --> 02:00:17,022
You'll get one executive summary.

1185
02:00:17,402 --> 02:00:22,024
And you will not get detailed information because of emergency management issues.

1186
02:00:23,424 --> 02:00:24,285
And is there a time?

1187
02:00:24,805 --> 02:00:26,025
Do you have an idea of when that would be?

1188
02:00:26,045 --> 02:00:27,466
We're waiting to get the individual reports.

1189
02:00:27,486 --> 02:00:28,947
It's a part of the executive session.

1190
02:00:29,207 --> 02:00:31,007
Yeah, we're going to update later on.

1191
02:00:31,227 --> 02:00:32,028
Gotcha.

1192
02:00:32,088 --> 02:00:34,789
Disability awareness report, special ed subcommittee.

1193
02:00:35,902 --> 02:00:39,246
We had an update on that and we'll be having a follow-up meeting.

1194
02:00:39,366 --> 02:00:51,159
I just want to speak with the superintendent about scheduling that and my associates, of course, as well as the special education and the special education pack.

1195
02:00:51,980 --> 02:00:53,842
And the next one is a January item.

1196
02:00:55,564 --> 02:00:56,005
Very good.

1197
02:00:57,061 --> 02:01:01,047
We had put negotiations and legal matters off to the end of the docket.

1198
02:01:01,348 --> 02:01:05,435
Is there a motion from the committee to go into executive session by Ms.

1199
02:01:05,455 --> 02:01:06,677
Mustone, seconded by Ms.

1200
02:01:06,717 --> 02:01:06,977
Kretz?

1201
02:01:07,017 --> 02:01:07,798
Roll call vote, please.

1202
02:01:09,982 --> 02:01:10,182
Yes.

1203
02:01:20,669 --> 02:01:23,851
Yes, the vote is seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

1204
02:01:24,232 --> 02:01:31,917
We will enter executive session and we will most likely adjourn, we will adjourn from opening up our executive session later on.

1205
02:01:32,557 --> 02:01:32,878
Thank you.
