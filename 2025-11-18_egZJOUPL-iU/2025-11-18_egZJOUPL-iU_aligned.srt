Be it resolved that the city council sends our deepest condolences to the family of George Sacco.

81
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:35,863
Mr. Sacco dedicated himself to public service as a member of the Medford School Committee from 1959 to 1962 and as our state representative from 1963 to 1974.

82
00:18:36,963 --> 00:18:37,743
Councilor Scarpelli.

83
00:18:38,783 --> 00:18:39,723
Thank you, Mr. President.

84
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,724
I apologize for not putting this on sooner, but

85
00:18:42,309 --> 00:18:56,920
When I heard just recently that Mr. Sacco had passed, I wanted to make sure that this council recognized a gentleman that really gave his life to public service.

86
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:03,285
And he's someone that when he fought against you, you knew it.

87
00:19:04,146 --> 00:19:07,709
But when he worked with you and supported you, you knew that too.

88
00:19:07,849 --> 00:19:10,591
So he's definitely going to be missed.

89
00:19:10,951 --> 00:19:12,092
We want to thank his family.

90
00:19:12,721 --> 00:19:18,864
for giving, letting him be part of the process for so many years here in Medford.

91
00:19:19,464 --> 00:19:29,468
And I know that he battled at the end of his life, but we just want to send our condolences and our respect for everything he did for our community.

92
00:19:29,948 --> 00:19:31,869
And may he rest in peace, Mr. President.

93
00:19:31,909 --> 00:19:32,269
Thank you.

94
00:19:32,949 --> 00:19:34,070
Thank you, Councilor Scarpa.

95
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:34,830
Councilor Callahan.

96
00:19:36,829 --> 00:19:37,149
Thank you.

97
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:41,452
George Sacco really was quite a gem.

98
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:48,016
I know when I was knocking on doors two plus years ago, he answered the door.

99
00:19:48,936 --> 00:19:57,442
He was incredibly excited that a candidate was knocking, was talking to residents.

100
00:19:58,482 --> 00:20:04,006
He immediately made a tiny donation, which was so lovely, like right there, just handed it to me.

101
00:20:05,327 --> 00:20:15,296
He just was a very supportive person, understanding of electoral politics and supportive of people who were willing to put themselves out there.

102
00:20:16,236 --> 00:20:18,498
And I am very supportive of this.

103
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:22,802
Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

104
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:26,846
I also had the pleasure to help connect my cousin,

105
00:20:27,591 --> 00:20:34,153
Ian Koss is a Medford resident now who made the Big Dig podcast with, he's the host of that podcast.

106
00:20:34,193 --> 00:20:46,797
If folks have listened to it, I connected him with George a couple of years ago, and he was incredibly helpful to him on some of his research around the Big Dig, and I think also a little bit of maybe on the lottery podcast that came out a little later.

107
00:20:47,077 --> 00:20:50,738
So, you know, a great resource and a loss to our community.

108
00:20:51,218 --> 00:20:51,838
Very prepared.

109
00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:56,820
On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Callahan,

110
00:20:58,345 --> 00:20:58,945
to approve.

111
00:20:59,686 --> 00:21:01,607
We'll take a vote and then we'll take a moment of silence.

112
00:21:01,707 --> 00:21:02,707
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

113
00:21:05,468 --> 00:21:06,349

Yes.

118
00:21:13,932 --> 00:21:14,553
Councilor Lemming?

119
00:21:14,893 --> 00:21:15,053
Yes.

120
00:21:16,053 --> 00:21:16,914
Councilor Scott Pelley?

121
00:21:17,134 --> 00:21:17,394
Yes.

122
00:21:18,214 --> 00:21:18,775
Councilor Sang?

123
00:21:18,815 --> 00:21:18,895
Yes.

124
00:21:19,995 --> 00:21:20,696
President Beers?

125
00:21:20,936 --> 00:21:21,136
Yes.

126
00:21:21,236 --> 00:21:21,776
I'm in the affirmative.

127
00:21:21,796 --> 00:21:22,356
None in the negative.

128
00:21:22,396 --> 00:21:23,557
Please rise for a moment of silence.

129
00:21:52,673 --> 00:21:53,274
really quickly.

130
00:21:53,294 --> 00:21:54,134
Thank you.

131
00:21:54,154 --> 00:21:56,297
I just wanted to say he was a consummate.

132
00:21:56,617 --> 00:21:59,820
He was one of the best gentlemen I've ever known in the city.

133
00:22:01,061 --> 00:22:04,144
I am shocked to hear it, but he was up there in numbers.

134
00:22:04,885 --> 00:22:05,445
I'll miss him.

135
00:22:05,686 --> 00:22:06,026
Thank you.

136
00:22:06,827 --> 00:22:07,367
Thank you, Indy.

137
00:22:09,029 --> 00:22:10,150
Communications from the Mayor.

138
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:13,093

143
00:22:54,531 --> 00:23:10,815
Effective July 1, 2023, 3% increase to the base salary of all patrol and superiors union titles for a COLA and 1.5% for implementation of body-worn cameras and the requirements placed on the members of the association due to police reform legislation and the implementation of the Peace Officer Standards and Training Commission.

144
00:23:11,576 --> 00:23:18,778
Effective July 1, 2024, 3% increase in base salary, 1.5% for implementation of BWC and post-commission.

00:23:19,619 --> 00:23:31,142

00:23:39,653 --> 00:23:42,417
Human Resources Director Lisa Crowley will be available to answer any questions.

149
00:23:42,457 --> 00:23:43,960
Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

150
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:46,063
Respectfully submitted, Breanna Lingle Kern, Mayor.

151
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:49,788
We have Director Crowley, I thought I saw earlier.

152
00:23:49,808 --> 00:23:51,871
Anything you want to present on this?

153
00:24:02,103 --> 00:24:02,643
This is on.

154
00:24:02,923 --> 00:24:03,224
It's on.

155
00:24:03,504 --> 00:24:03,744
Okay.

156
00:24:03,904 --> 00:24:04,284
Thank you.

157
00:24:04,344 --> 00:24:06,725
Through you, President Baez, to the council.

158
00:24:07,725 --> 00:24:12,647
That cut out three quarters of my speech, so I can just kind of go over.

159
00:24:12,788 --> 00:24:20,611
Through the dedicated efforts of the mayor and the union presidents and the negotiation team, we successfully reached a fair and equitable compromise.

160
00:24:20,631 --> 00:24:25,293
As part of the agreement, we secured a six-year contract rather than a standard three-year term.

161
00:24:26,033 --> 00:24:33,138
The extended duration provides significant stability, as a three-year agreement would have placed us in evergreen status almost immediately.

162
00:24:34,518 --> 00:24:38,841
With the six-year agreement, we will remain current with these unions through June 30, 2028.

163
00:24:38,901 --> 00:24:42,844
Thank you.

164
00:24:42,864 --> 00:24:44,144
Councilor Scarpelli.

165
00:24:46,406 --> 00:24:46,726
Thank you.

166
00:24:47,186 --> 00:24:48,087
I first want to

167
00:24:49,216 --> 00:25:04,224
It's been a long time coming, and I think that both leaders and our patrol men and women deserve the right that we waive the three readings tonight, and I would approve this, Mr. President, moving forward in favor.

168
00:25:04,464 --> 00:25:04,724
Thank you.

169
00:25:04,744 --> 00:25:11,988
We have a motion from Councilor Scarpelli to waive the three readings and approve, seconded by, seconded by Councilor Lemming.

170
00:25:12,008 --> 00:25:13,989
Is there any further discussion by members of the Council?

171
00:25:16,512 --> 00:25:18,214
Seeing none, is there any discussion by members of the public?

172
00:25:18,274 --> 00:25:21,598
I do see some representatives from our patrol and superiors union.

173
00:25:21,618 --> 00:25:22,899
You guys want to say anything?

174
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:25,763
All right.

175
00:25:27,703 --> 00:25:29,064
Yeah, if I can.

176
00:25:29,084 --> 00:25:47,714
I know that we want to thank our police officers because I think that it's tough when it's funny when you have people fighting and protecting our community and sometimes you don't feel like you are given the respect that you deserve.

177
00:25:48,415 --> 00:25:51,757
And I'm hoping this is just a little bit to make sure that

178
00:25:53,092 --> 00:25:57,013
everybody's spirits are high and we're moving forward in a positive direction.

179
00:25:57,673 --> 00:26:01,074
I love the fact that it's six years and we don't have to worry about that.

180
00:26:01,094 --> 00:26:04,055
And you just have to worry about your families and taking care of yourselves and being safe.

181
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:05,836
So thank you for everything you do.

182
00:26:06,096 --> 00:26:06,956
And we appreciate you.

183
00:26:07,536 --> 00:26:07,856
Thank you.

184
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:08,576
Thank you.

185
00:26:08,596 --> 00:26:09,537
Councilor Scarpelli.

186
00:26:09,657 --> 00:26:10,677
Councilor Lazaro.

187
00:26:12,297 --> 00:26:12,938
Uh, thank you.

188
00:26:13,658 --> 00:26:18,879
I agree that this is, uh, an important move.

189
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:21,320
We have to pay people in the city if we,

190
00:26:23,112 --> 00:26:29,594
would like to keep our strong employees here and we want to attract strong employees in the future.

191
00:26:30,434 --> 00:26:33,275
And that's true across the city.

192
00:26:34,956 --> 00:26:41,818
Good contracts that make our employees feel valued is very important.

193
00:26:44,546 --> 00:26:56,456
Of course, having a police department where we can enforce our laws, where we can have traffic enforcement, where we can have safety across the city and enforcement of the things that we value.

194
00:26:56,957 --> 00:27:01,681
We have to make sure that we're paying people what they deserve.

195
00:27:02,441 --> 00:27:07,686
So I support this and I appreciate the work that went into negotiating the contract.

196
00:27:08,146 --> 00:27:08,427
Thank you.

197
00:27:08,867 --> 00:27:09,307
Thank you.

198
00:27:09,427 --> 00:27:10,028
Councilor Lemming.

199
00:27:12,322 --> 00:27:19,867
Just echoing what my colleagues have said, I appreciate everybody who's taken the time to come out here tonight.

200
00:27:21,408 --> 00:27:30,834
Sorry that it took so long, that really shouldn't have happened, but I'm glad that it reached a resolution and I'll be proudly voting yes on this.

201
00:27:31,334 --> 00:27:31,995
Thank you very much.

202
00:27:34,876 --> 00:27:35,337
Thank you.

203
00:27:35,657 --> 00:27:40,260
On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Lemming to waive the three readings and approve.

204
00:27:41,043 --> 00:27:42,224
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

205
00:27:43,685 --> 00:27:44,445
Councilor Callahan.

206
00:27:44,465 --> 00:27:44,525
Yes.

207
00:27:46,326 --> 00:27:47,327
Vice President Collins.

208
00:27:47,767 --> 00:27:47,947
Yes.

209
00:27:49,589 --> 00:27:50,289
Councilor Zaro.

210
00:27:50,309 --> 00:27:50,369
Yes.

211
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:52,490
Councilor Lemming.

212
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:54,131
Yes.

213
00:27:54,151 --> 00:27:54,992
Councilor Scarpelli.

214
00:27:55,012 --> 00:27:55,072
Yes.

215
00:27:56,333 --> 00:27:56,913
Councilor Singh.

216
00:27:56,933 --> 00:27:57,013
Yes.

217
00:27:58,074 --> 00:27:58,634
President Pierce.

218
00:27:58,714 --> 00:27:58,914
Yes.

219
00:27:58,955 --> 00:28:01,336
Having the affirmative, none of the negative, the motion passes.

220
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:05,859
Petitions, presentations, and similar papers.

221
00:28:05,879 --> 00:28:09,902
25175, petition for amendment to common victuals license extended hours, Raza's Grill.

222
00:28:10,875 --> 00:28:20,177
To the Honorable City Council, City Councilors, the undersigned respectfully request an amendment for operating hours for our common victors license, Monday through Saturday, Monday through Sunday, 7 a.m.

223
00:28:20,277 --> 00:28:27,258
to 1 a.m., brief explanation to extend food and beverage service to late night patrons, reestablish late night patrons, which we had for many prior years.

224
00:28:28,098 --> 00:28:33,999
Business name, KLME, Inc., DBA, Razo's Grill, business address, 209 Mystic Avenue, business telephone, 781-396-2001.

225
00:28:34,019 --> 00:28:34,919
Business owner, Richard Razo.

226
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:40,824
I think we have Mr. Arrazzo here.

227
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:43,886
I recognize Councilor Scarpelli.

228
00:28:44,827 --> 00:28:46,268
Thank you, Mr. President.

229
00:28:46,288 --> 00:28:47,769
It looks like everything is in order.

230
00:28:48,329 --> 00:29:04,640
And I know that before I move forward or ask any questions, I know Mr. Arrazzo might, if we can, I think what we talked about is I did talk to Mr. Arrazzo and looking at the process, to be fair, what we've

231
00:29:05,617 --> 00:29:21,690
done with neighboring establishments, like Mr. Razo's, I think that he would amend to, I believe it's Sunday to Wednesday until midnight, and then Friday, Thursday.

232
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:26,834
Is that okay, Mr. Razo?

233
00:29:27,034 --> 00:29:27,674
Mr. Razo.

234
00:29:28,335 --> 00:29:28,575
Go ahead.

235
00:29:28,615 --> 00:29:28,935
I'm sorry.

236
00:29:28,955 --> 00:29:29,315
I missed it.

237
00:29:29,335 --> 00:29:29,876
What did you say?

238
00:29:31,613 --> 00:29:36,297
Councilor Scarpelli was saying that you had requested to amend this request.

239
00:29:36,837 --> 00:29:39,439
So it's Thursday, Friday, and Saturday till 1 a.m.

240
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:42,981
And then Monday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday until midnight.

241
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:44,643
Yeah, that's fine.

242
00:29:48,625 --> 00:29:49,626
I see everything in order.

243
00:29:49,726 --> 00:29:51,507
I had it, excuse me, I'm sorry.

244
00:29:51,567 --> 00:29:53,349
I had it every night till 1 a.m.

245
00:29:54,089 --> 00:29:54,990
for 18 years.

246
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,011
And then two years ago,

247
00:29:57,272 --> 00:29:59,333
They sent me a, I didn't even notice it.

248
00:29:59,373 --> 00:29:59,673
It said 11.

249
00:30:00,353 --> 00:30:04,355
So, uh, I was wondering if I could actually get it 1 0 AM every night.

250
00:30:04,375 --> 00:30:04,475
Okay.

251
00:30:05,115 --> 00:30:06,996
Oh, I misunderstood.

252
00:30:07,016 --> 00:30:08,417
I would, I wouldn't impose that.

253
00:30:09,217 --> 00:30:12,239
Um, you know, it's been a long time establishment.

254
00:30:12,339 --> 00:30:18,021
I think that no different, the 30, 60, 90 day review, um, every day until 1 AM.

255
00:30:18,721 --> 00:30:20,102
Um, I don't, I wouldn't oppose that.

256
00:30:20,617 --> 00:30:21,237
Mr. President.

257
00:30:21,638 --> 00:30:26,761
So the motion is to approve, uh, every night, seven, every day, 7 a.m.

258
00:30:26,841 --> 00:30:27,441
to 1 a.m.

259
00:30:27,901 --> 00:30:29,822
with a 30, 60, 90 day review.

260
00:30:29,842 --> 00:30:32,684
Uh, do we have any further questions from the council?

261
00:30:32,804 --> 00:30:33,745
Councilor Lazaro?

262
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:38,267
Um, what was it that we approved for the great American beer hall?

263
00:30:38,327 --> 00:30:42,090
Could we, it does, uh, do you remember where we landed with that?

264
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:43,651
It's four days.

265
00:30:43,671 --> 00:30:45,492
I think they're till midnight.

266
00:30:45,912 --> 00:30:47,733
And then the other day is till two in the morning.

267
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:50,929
to double check.

268
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:55,990
Is there would anybody be able to speak to?

269
00:30:57,831 --> 00:31:08,153
Because I think they requested something similar like every night until the same time, but we had asked that they stay open quite that late.

270
00:31:08,773 --> 00:31:12,074
Would somebody be able to explain to me why this is different?

271
00:31:12,534 --> 00:31:13,514
It's on the same street, right?

272
00:31:14,394 --> 00:31:14,514
Yes.

273
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:24,139
I mean, I can look it up, but... No, I know it's on the same... Yeah, it's on Mystic App, but... No, no, no.

274
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:27,281
I mean, if you wanna check the minutes... Yeah, I can check the minutes.

275
00:31:27,681 --> 00:31:28,322
All right.

276
00:31:28,462 --> 00:31:29,022
I'm just curious.

277
00:31:29,643 --> 00:31:38,289
If this establishment has been open until 1 AM, the whole... For a good number of years, I'm comfortable with approving it.

278
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:44,033
I just think that if we have establishments that are open

279
00:31:45,826 --> 00:32:00,617
Prior to enforcement of a time limit, it feels arbitrary to me to start enforcing a time limit and then enforce it.

280
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:03,291
differently for different establishments.

281
00:32:04,331 --> 00:32:07,152
I'm comfortable with this business being open until 1 a.m.

282
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:08,452
for this request.

283
00:32:09,652 --> 00:32:27,457
I would just say that if we could keep a little bit closer track of who, which businesses on which streets are open until certain times, instead of saying that some businesses have to close at arbitrary times for reasons that I can't identify, I would appreciate it.

284
00:32:31,387 --> 00:32:31,927
It's funny.

285
00:32:32,968 --> 00:32:41,630
I think a lot of the conversation with Great American Beer Hall just had to do with noise complaints coming from the neighbors.

286
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,951
It was a pretty extensive conversation.

287
00:32:44,051 --> 00:32:47,492
I mean, I used to live in this area.

288
00:32:47,512 --> 00:32:50,393
I used to walk past Razzles all the time.

289
00:32:50,453 --> 00:32:55,815
I don't think I ever heard any loud noises coming out of there.

290
00:32:55,875 --> 00:32:58,976
So it just wasn't as much of a concern.

291
00:32:59,923 --> 00:33:02,505
an issue on the radar for a lot of the neighbors.

292
00:33:05,026 --> 00:33:09,529
And I don't think it has been for as long as it's been open.

293
00:33:09,629 --> 00:33:12,931
So I mean, it is a little bit arbitrary.

294
00:33:12,951 --> 00:33:14,892
I would agree.

295
00:33:15,333 --> 00:33:24,519
But I imagine if there were a room full of neighbors here talking about noise complaints, it would be a very different conversation.

296
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,480
But that's really not the case.

297
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,251
Councilor Callahan, then Councilor Scarpelli.

298
00:33:32,291 --> 00:33:33,171
Thank you.

299
00:33:34,151 --> 00:33:37,092
I do see this as not arbitrary, not an arbitrary difference.

300
00:33:37,132 --> 00:33:46,034
I think Great American Bear Hall has live bands and live music, giant speakers, and Razzos, I believe, does not have those things.

301
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:56,180
I like the fact that we treat different businesses differently and that we enable businesses that don't have any noise complaints to stay open later.

302
00:33:57,121 --> 00:34:02,204
My one question is, if you were open till 1 a.m., if the business was open till 1 a.m.

303
00:34:02,544 --> 00:34:08,348
for 18 years and then two years ago it became limited, what was the reason why that changed two years ago?

304
00:34:08,388 --> 00:34:10,009
Were there any neighborhood complaints?

305
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:12,970
Was it some administrative change?

306
00:34:13,071 --> 00:34:13,811
I'm just curious.

307
00:34:15,092 --> 00:34:16,853
Is that for me to answer?

308
00:34:18,453 --> 00:34:20,655
Is that, oh, okay.

309
00:34:21,015 --> 00:34:30,264
So when I opened in 2005, the Common Vic license stayed at 11, but the liquor license was till 1 a.m.

310
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:39,492
So two years ago, someone in the city discovered that the liquor licenses don't match the Common Vic.

311
00:34:39,812 --> 00:34:42,695
So there was a process that you had to go before the,

312
00:34:43,624 --> 00:34:51,768
before the council to up your common vix and then they would amend it on the liquor license or honor it on the liquor license.

313
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:55,410
The gentleman, the clerk was very helpful.

314
00:34:55,450 --> 00:35:00,213
He kind of explained to me and helped me out going through this process.

315
00:35:01,394 --> 00:35:02,254
Yeah.

316
00:35:03,075 --> 00:35:03,475
Thanks.

317
00:35:03,495 --> 00:35:04,695
That was my question.

318
00:35:04,756 --> 00:35:08,658
It sounds like it was a purely administrative change and not because of any kind of neighborhood complaints.

319
00:35:08,698 --> 00:35:09,158
Thank you so much.

320
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:11,568
Thank you, Mr. Arzo.

321
00:35:11,588 --> 00:35:12,589
Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

322
00:35:12,629 --> 00:35:13,409
Councilor Scarpelli.

323
00:35:13,829 --> 00:35:15,270
Thank you, Mr. President Baez.

324
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:20,012
I know that Councilor Callahan has actually just answered a few of the questions.

325
00:35:20,072 --> 00:35:24,934
I did go to the code enforcement officer.

326
00:35:24,954 --> 00:35:31,657
I asked if there were any complaints and I was then directed to the police department because they take the noise complaints.

327
00:35:32,837 --> 00:35:39,960
There were no complaints on file, but I think that like my colleague has mentioned that it

328
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:42,150
There is a distinction between the two.

329
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:54,912
Razzle's is more of a restaurant, family restaurant that then will stay open for food when we're talking about the neighboring establishment.

330
00:35:55,493 --> 00:35:57,253
It wasn't that people were in the room.

331
00:35:57,433 --> 00:36:03,394
The fact that I think that even I think when in the discussion, it was 30, 60, 90 day review.

332
00:36:03,934 --> 00:36:10,255
And I believe asking the owners of that establishment to look for soundproofing material that they can come back and revisit.

333
00:36:11,224 --> 00:36:15,392
as long as we're seeing that they're doing what the neighbors have asked.

334
00:36:16,294 --> 00:36:16,654
So I don't

335
00:36:17,573 --> 00:36:40,929
I don't think that would be a problem if down the line they come back in front of us and we don't, there are no issues with the noise they put in the sound barriers that were discussed that evening and then moving them to a very similar process, at least that would be my, the way I would look at it as a chairperson's committee that's looking at this.

336
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:47,113
So I would, like I said, I would move forward with the seven days with the review if we see that.

337
00:36:47,766 --> 00:36:53,469
the 30, 60, 90 days that it's really affecting the neighborhood, then we take action.

338
00:36:53,949 --> 00:36:54,650
Thank you, Mr. President.

339
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:55,970
Thank you.

340
00:36:55,990 --> 00:37:01,553
We have a motion from Councilor Scarpelli to approve the paper as proposed.

341
00:37:01,673 --> 00:37:02,274
So 7 a.m.

342
00:37:02,334 --> 00:37:02,854
to 1 a.m.

343
00:37:02,874 --> 00:37:08,257
7 days a week with a 30, 60, 90 day review, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

344
00:37:08,597 --> 00:37:10,718
And I will go to the podium.

345
00:37:11,799 --> 00:37:13,760
Name and address for the record, please.

346
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,461
Andrew Castaneda, East Methodist.

347
00:37:15,501 --> 00:37:17,362
I feel compelled to say something.

348
00:37:18,233 --> 00:37:25,116
This past officer, Razo, he's a great person and he's been here since 2005.

349
00:37:25,557 --> 00:37:28,138
He is on Mystic Ave with his business.

350
00:37:28,658 --> 00:37:32,720
I've never heard a noise from there, unlike the Bear Garden.

351
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:37,622
So I wish him the best and hope you go linear with him and go with him.

352
00:37:37,842 --> 00:37:38,643
Thank you very much.

353
00:37:39,563 --> 00:37:40,144
Thank you.

354
00:37:41,604 --> 00:37:46,066

355
00:37:47,965 --> 00:37:48,926
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

00:37:50,267 --> 00:37:50,988
Councilor Callahan.

357
00:37:51,008 --> 00:37:51,068
Yes.

358
00:37:52,269 --> 00:37:53,290
Vice President Collins.

359
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:53,950
Yes.

360
00:37:55,351 --> 00:37:55,932
Councilor Zaro.

361
00:37:55,972 --> 00:37:56,072
Yes.

362
00:37:57,453 --> 00:37:58,054
Councilor Lemming.

363
00:37:58,074 --> 00:37:58,134
Yes.

364
00:37:59,455 --> 00:38:00,176
Councilor Scott Belli.

365
00:38:00,196 --> 00:38:00,296
Yes.

366
00:38:01,357 --> 00:38:02,037

00:38:02,057 --> 00:38:03,058
Yes.

368
00:38:03,078 --> 00:38:03,618
President Pierce.

369
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:05,060
Yes.

370
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:09,503
Having the affirmative, none the negative, the motion passes.

371
00:38:09,523 --> 00:38:13,487
2-5-1-7-0, petition for a grant of location, National Grid, Bradbury Ave, and 4th Street.

372
00:38:15,237 --> 00:38:18,941
This is a proposed joint-owned pole at Bradbury Ave and 4th Street.

373
00:38:18,981 --> 00:38:26,487
You're hereby notified that by order of the Medford City Council, the Medford City Council will hold a public hearing on Tuesday, November 18th, 2025 at 7 p.m.

374
00:38:26,808 --> 00:38:32,573
on a petition by Massachusetts Electrical Company and DBA National Grid for permission to install Bradbury Avenue and 4th Street.

375
00:38:34,151 --> 00:38:37,794
This is to install a new regulator station and it will be granted.

376
00:38:38,174 --> 00:38:39,135
We're sorry.

377
00:38:39,375 --> 00:38:55,806
We're for a request that after due notice and hearing as provided by law, it will be granted a location for and permission to install a new regulator station, supervisory control and data acquisition cabinet in Bradbury Avenue, 4th Street, plan number W-0, W-0 number 9-0-0-0-2-2-0-0-5-1, originally dated June 18th, 2021, revised September 27th, 2024.

378
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:05,060
and filed in the office of the city clerk, October 22nd, 2025.

379
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:18,928
The engineering division has received this permission and recommends the grant of location to be approved with the following conditions, grant of location limited to the proposed cabinet, bollards and electrical conduits described in the plan before starting work.

380
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:31,750
The contractor shall notify DigSafe of obtaining all applicable permits, obtain a trench permit pursuant to section 74.141 of the city ordinances, and that the trench permit application must include a street restoration plan.

381
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:38,556
No other utility structures, conduits, duct banks, pipes, or any other appurtenances are adversely impacted.

382
00:39:39,256 --> 00:39:42,099
National Grid shall ensure that all sewer, water, and drain lines are marked.

383
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:46,302
Sidewalk and street restoration shall be done in consultation.

384
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:59,640
With the engineering division and per the requirements of an approved trench permit and engineering directive three, this must include site inspection, concrete sidewalk must be replaced in kind and cleanly cut at the joints.

385
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:06,858
Petunias concrete pavement over the trench shall be two inch milled and overlaid within the public way to an offset approved by the engineering division.

386
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:09,160
Pavement markings must be restored.

387
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,682
Project site must be swapped daily and kept free of debris.

388
00:40:11,902 --> 00:40:17,307
A detailed traffic management plan must be submitted for review prior to receiving a trench permit.

389
00:40:18,348 --> 00:40:21,811
And the plan indicates crossings at sewer, water, and drain mains with laterals.

390
00:40:21,851 --> 00:40:26,615
Gas mains shall maintain a vertical distance of 12 inches from all Medford utilities approved to the engineer.

391
00:40:27,673 --> 00:40:30,956
and signed Richard Lucio, Assistant City Clerk.

392
00:40:32,037 --> 00:40:42,647
So I'm going to recognize Diana Cuddy from National Grid to further present the paper, and then I'll open the public hearing.

393
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:45,380
Hi, good evening.

394
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:48,981
Diana Cuddy, National Grid, 170 Data Drive, Wealth End, Massachusetts.

395
00:40:49,441 --> 00:40:58,402
I'm here before you tonight to request a rental location for two SCADA boxes for two different regulator stations that are existing.

396
00:40:59,943 --> 00:41:06,624
This is in response to the recent MassDPU CMR 101 ruling that we upgrade our existing regulator stations.

397
00:41:07,544 --> 00:41:11,925
We have overhauled the existing regulator stations and are now adding updated SCADA equipment

398
00:41:14,225 --> 00:41:19,787
for the gas control national grid to monitor the regulator stations.

399
00:41:20,307 --> 00:41:30,490
So it's just the SCADA box, an electrical conduit that's underground, some gas piping that's underground, and one of them has a new header pipe that's underground.

400
00:41:32,811 --> 00:41:33,211
Thank you.

401
00:41:33,231 --> 00:41:34,871
Do we have any questions for Ms.

402
00:41:34,911 --> 00:41:36,252
Cuddy from members of the council?

403
00:41:39,132 --> 00:41:41,213
Seeing none, I'm going to open the public hearing.

404
00:41:41,807 --> 00:41:43,027
Public hearing is open.

405
00:41:43,047 --> 00:41:47,708
If there's anyone who'd like to speak on this paper, either in favor against or otherwise.

406
00:41:49,889 --> 00:41:50,029
Ms.

407
00:41:50,069 --> 00:41:50,369
Cuddy.

408
00:41:53,089 --> 00:41:56,810
Yes, I'm in favor of the petition or the grant allocation for both, yes.

409
00:41:56,870 --> 00:42:03,592
Is there anyone else who'd like to speak on this matter as part of the public hearing?

410
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:10,393
Seeing none, I'm declaring the public hearing closed.

411
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:15,322
Councilor Scarpelli has moved to approve, seconded by.

412
00:42:16,403 --> 00:42:17,825
Seconded by Councilor Lazaro.

413
00:42:17,865 --> 00:42:18,785
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

414
00:42:22,148 --> 00:42:22,909
Councilor Kellyanne.

415
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:25,311
Vice President Collins.

416
00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:25,992
Yes.

417
00:42:27,353 --> 00:42:28,094
Councilor Lazaro.

418
00:42:28,114 --> 00:42:28,174
Yes.

419
00:42:29,775 --> 00:42:30,396
Councilor Lemming.

420
00:42:30,416 --> 00:42:31,777
Yes.

421
00:42:31,797 --> 00:42:32,518
Councilor Scarpelli.

422
00:42:32,538 --> 00:42:32,618
Yes.

423
00:42:33,739 --> 00:42:34,339
Councilor Singh.

424
00:42:34,359 --> 00:42:34,419
Yes.

425
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,021
President Beers.

426
00:42:36,265 --> 00:42:37,786
Yes, 70 affirmative and then the negative.

427
00:42:37,806 --> 00:42:43,489
The motion passes 25171 petition for greater location National Grid Ross St.

428
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:48,751
This is functionally the same petition, but just for Ross St with the same conditions.

429
00:42:49,392 --> 00:42:54,054
Diana, is there anything you'd like to add or anything about this site that is different from the previous petition?

430
00:42:55,415 --> 00:42:58,116
Nope, this one's actually basically the exact same.

431
00:42:58,136 --> 00:43:01,098
It just doesn't have the header pipe, so it's the exact same.

432
00:43:02,678 --> 00:43:05,260
Reason we need to upgrade it based on the recent DPU

433
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:19,616
CM 101 ruling that we have to upgrade our existing stations, which we have done in over and upgrade the skater box and the conduit to and from the skater box to the vault and to a utility pole.

434
00:43:19,636 --> 00:43:22,820
All right, thank you.

435
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,863
Any questions from members of the council for Ms.

436
00:43:25,883 --> 00:43:26,103
Kennedy?

437
00:43:29,175 --> 00:43:35,840
Seeing none, I'm going to open the public hearing to anyone who's in favor in opposition or otherwise has a comment on the matter.

438
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:35,900
Ms.

439
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:37,061
Cuddy?

440
00:43:37,702 --> 00:43:38,302
Diana Cuddy.

441
00:43:38,602 --> 00:43:40,744
I am in favor of this grant allocation.

442
00:43:42,545 --> 00:43:42,966
Thank you.

443
00:43:42,986 --> 00:43:46,088
Is there anyone else who has a comment on this paper?

444
00:43:49,971 --> 00:43:52,193
Seeing none, I'm declaring the public hearing closed.

445
00:43:52,773 --> 00:43:53,354
Is there a motion?

446
00:43:55,803 --> 00:43:59,066
On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to approve, seconded by Councilor Sang.

447
00:43:59,266 --> 00:44:00,307
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

448
00:44:02,169 --> 00:44:02,990
Councilor Callahan?

449
00:44:04,351 --> 00:44:05,392
Vice President Collins?

450
00:44:05,832 --> 00:44:06,032
Yes.

451
00:44:07,414 --> 00:44:08,234
Councilor Zahra?

452
00:44:09,796 --> 00:44:10,476
Councilor Lemming?

453
00:44:11,898 --> 00:44:12,778
Councilor Scarpelli?

454
00:44:13,979 --> 00:44:14,740
Councilor Sang?

455
00:44:16,101 --> 00:44:16,742
President Beers?

456
00:44:16,962 --> 00:44:17,162
Yes.

457
00:44:17,182 --> 00:44:18,443
I have an affirmative, none the negative.

458
00:44:18,463 --> 00:44:19,324
The motion passes.

459
00:44:20,285 --> 00:44:20,946
Thank you very much.

460
00:44:20,966 --> 00:44:22,087
Have a nice evening.

461
00:44:25,626 --> 00:44:29,408
Hearings 25160 submitted by Office of Planning, Development, and Sustainability.

462
00:44:29,508 --> 00:44:33,631
Proposed amendments to the Bedford Zoning Ordinance, Salem Street Neighborhood Corridor District Map Change.

463
00:44:34,832 --> 00:44:38,014
This is a continuation of our public hearing from our last meeting.

464
00:44:40,015 --> 00:44:51,402
I know a number of councilors had said that they generally supported the paper, but wanted to see communications from the mayor, and I see Vice President Collins, so I'll recognize Vice President Collins.

465
00:44:55,005 --> 00:44:55,825
Thank you, President Behrs.

466
00:44:57,926 --> 00:45:03,828
Yes, we talked about this at length last week in our regular meeting when the hearing was opened.

467
00:45:04,208 --> 00:45:19,933
Since that time, I personally have had some good exchange with the mayor over this past week, and I feel that we are certainly closing the distance on what to expect from a contract extension from Innis Associates.

468
00:45:20,944 --> 00:45:42,137
and closing the distance on a framework for the next RFP to cover the rest of the zoning overhaul between an initial framework and what I think there is broad consensus that the Council and the community needs to see from that process in terms of more robust engagement in outreach to the public and community engagement and a slower pace.

469
00:45:43,498 --> 00:45:44,398
I'm feeling optimistic.

470
00:45:44,458 --> 00:45:49,982
I suspect that we can probably come to an agreement hopefully before Thanksgiving, but I'm going to continue to hold out for

471
00:45:51,087 --> 00:45:58,372
reaching that consensus and being able to share it publicly before I, as one councillor, am going to feel comfortable voting on the Salem Street amendments.

472
00:45:59,933 --> 00:46:16,824
Like I said, my bottom line is that we need to have a public commitment that the contract extension, the next RFP, will allow us to do this right with sufficient resources for community engagement and public outreach and neighborhood shredding, all the things that many councillors and community members have been asking for for over a year and a half.

473
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:25,597
and we'd really need the budget and the resources to support this so that people can engage with this important process in the way that they really want to and have been trying to do.

474
00:46:26,138 --> 00:46:27,338
So I'm confident that we'll get there.

475
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:31,401
I'm gonna keep working for that outcome so that this process gets better as it goes along.

476
00:46:32,081 --> 00:46:41,306
But given that we are not quite there yet, I would, after the hearing is opened, I'd like to motion to continue the hearing the December 2nd with the expectation that we can take a vote at that meeting.

477
00:46:41,607 --> 00:46:41,847
Thank you.

478
00:46:44,648 --> 00:46:44,989
Thank you.

479
00:46:45,069 --> 00:46:47,090
Is there any further discussion by members of the council?

480
00:46:49,627 --> 00:46:55,511
Seeing none, I do see the Chief of Staff, if you want to speak on this paper, Chief of Staff Nazarian.

481
00:46:57,953 --> 00:46:58,673
Good evening, everyone.

482
00:46:58,773 --> 00:47:00,414
Thank you.

483
00:47:01,415 --> 00:47:05,878
You know, I'm a little

484
00:47:07,416 --> 00:47:10,138
surprised that there's not more movement on this this evening.

485
00:47:12,259 --> 00:47:26,987
As you know, the mayor had communicated with the council prior to the last meeting and had outlined a number of different commitments that was based on conversations with you all individually.

486
00:47:27,847 --> 00:47:29,248
Obviously, it's a little bit difficult.

487
00:47:29,288 --> 00:47:30,910
We're all navigating the open meeting law.

488
00:47:31,370 --> 00:47:52,489
The mayor has the ability, unlike you all, to discuss with each of you and try to compile all that information and data into one email to you in a hope to get this matter resolved because it's really, as you all probably heard from her directly, something that the mayor is

489
00:47:54,106 --> 00:48:10,267
has been, feels strongly about, not personally, but because there's been two community development boards who have voted to make this recommendation, and because the neighbors in that neighborhood specifically have been seeking this change.

490
00:48:11,828 --> 00:48:33,073
So, you know, I figured I would come up here and I would have this discussion and push a little bit respectfully to you all that, you know, this is not necessarily something that the mayor herself is saying that needs to change, but something that she's hearing from the community that she feels needs to change.

491
00:48:33,833 --> 00:48:38,855
And, you know, I'm sure you all know there was a 1,100 person petition on this matter.

492
00:48:41,596 --> 00:48:56,886
I think, you know, I have more and I'd like to go on, but I can pause and say, you know, in hearing some reflections from that last meeting from counselors who reached out directly, and we appreciate those direct

493
00:48:58,227 --> 00:49:03,789
contacts, there was a suggestion that was made that the mayor put information in bulleted form.

494
00:49:04,389 --> 00:49:22,076
And, you know, while largely the information that the mayor had presented in her prior week's email contained a significant, if not, you know, complete list of those things, you know, the format or the succinctness was presented the way that the council had recommended it be presented.

495
00:49:22,616 --> 00:49:24,537
And now I'm hearing

496
00:49:25,257 --> 00:49:31,719
the council prepared to vote to table this again, which without any discussion, which is surprising.

497
00:49:32,359 --> 00:49:34,820
And I just like to engage the council in dialogue on that.

498
00:49:36,161 --> 00:49:36,401
Sure.

499
00:49:36,521 --> 00:49:39,682
Councillor Lemming, then Councillor Zara, then Councillor Collins.

500
00:49:39,742 --> 00:49:40,982
Councillor Lemming, then Councillor Callahan.

501
00:49:41,422 --> 00:49:42,823
I mean, it's the mayor's... I'm sorry.

502
00:49:42,843 --> 00:49:44,103
Go ahead.

503
00:49:44,775 --> 00:50:03,314
It's the mayor's choice that we're doing this, you know, like having this entire conversation of you need to undo this one thing that you did in March, or else nothing continues that that that is a framing that she put forward herself.

504
00:50:04,463 --> 00:50:17,973
And we said at the last meeting, we would actually like to see the final draft of the contract that you are going to put in front of Ennis before we do this.

505
00:50:18,853 --> 00:50:24,697
And like Council Vice President Collins said, the bullet points are nice.

506
00:50:25,177 --> 00:50:28,740
We want to actually see what the contract looks like.

507
00:50:33,007 --> 00:50:38,930
A lot of the discussion last time was just how it is not healthy to be doing this.

508
00:50:41,171 --> 00:50:47,194
I mean, we talked extensively about the reasoning behind MX1 versus MX2.

509
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:52,156
But at the end of the day, like I said before, it is November 2025, and we are still discussing

510
00:50:56,663 --> 00:50:57,323
Salem Street.

511
00:50:58,163 --> 00:50:59,124
We're still discussing it.

512
00:50:59,624 --> 00:51:06,165
And again, residents come here and a lot of them agreed with the decision.

513
00:51:06,185 --> 00:51:10,567
A lot of them did not agree with the decision that the council made in March.

514
00:51:11,827 --> 00:51:17,528
And I have complete sympathy with both sides there.

515
00:51:18,449 --> 00:51:20,029
But we can't

516
00:51:21,155 --> 00:51:33,126
come up with this framework where we're just revisiting every single decision that this council makes months after the fact, and kind of doing this public game of chicken.

517
00:51:33,146 --> 00:51:37,730
I mean, if the mayor wants to do a public game of chicken, like this, that's what we're doing.

518
00:51:38,211 --> 00:51:46,198
But I hope that we can actually see the contract just so that there is, you know, which is exactly what we wanted.

519
00:51:46,218 --> 00:51:46,278
And

520
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:51,681
that we can continue with the rezoning process.

521
00:51:51,721 --> 00:51:55,704
So anyway, I'm repeating myself now, but that's what I have to say about that.

522
00:51:57,185 --> 00:51:58,106
Councilor Lazaro.

523
00:52:00,067 --> 00:52:00,528
Thank you.

524
00:52:00,708 --> 00:52:03,490
Through the chair, we spoke on the phone.

525
00:52:03,830 --> 00:52:15,199
I just want to see a public proposal so that I know that it will happen.

526
00:52:17,149 --> 00:52:22,392
I don't want to have to trust that things are going to play out the way that we expect them to play out.

527
00:52:25,273 --> 00:52:29,135
I was very explicit in what I was hoping to see happen by this week.

528
00:52:29,335 --> 00:52:30,175
It did not happen.

529
00:52:30,515 --> 00:52:34,397
We did get the bulleted very clear list of things that will take place.

530
00:52:34,477 --> 00:52:35,398
I said, sounds great.

531
00:52:35,558 --> 00:52:38,299
If it can be made public, I can move forward with this.

532
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,301
I was very clear last week that I don't

533
00:52:42,101 --> 00:52:49,245
I don't think it's a reasonable thing that we have to do, but I'll do it because the bigger project is more important than one intersection.

534
00:52:49,265 --> 00:52:58,951
I would like it to be publicly stated what is going to happen as a result of us taking this vote, and I will not take the vote until it's publicly stated.

535
00:52:59,928 --> 00:53:08,312
just to us, but to everybody in the city who's interested in hearing about it, and that we can point to it so that it happens.

536
00:53:09,032 --> 00:53:12,954
That's all that I would like to see, a public statement of what will happen.

537
00:53:13,214 --> 00:53:13,514
Thank you.

538
00:53:15,475 --> 00:53:16,716
Councillor Callahan.

539
00:53:18,536 --> 00:53:18,756
Thank you.

540
00:53:21,461 --> 00:53:23,683
I think we were pretty clear last time.

541
00:53:23,803 --> 00:53:25,444
I'm not sure why there is confusion.

542
00:53:25,464 --> 00:53:29,487
I think what was spoken at this meeting was very clear.

543
00:53:31,069 --> 00:53:42,698
In my opinion, the many years of plans that this city did that included thousands and thousands of residents, I believe should be a commitment.

544
00:53:42,958 --> 00:53:43,538
The mayor's

545
00:53:44,519 --> 00:53:48,361
The very first page of the comprehensive plan is the mayor saying how proud she is of that plan.

546
00:53:50,182 --> 00:53:57,345
It is the City Council's purview to take that and the vision of our residents and turn it into zoning.

547
00:53:57,665 --> 00:54:00,086
That is the purview of the City Council.

548
00:54:00,606 --> 00:54:04,408
And what is happening right now is the mayor has decided that

549
00:54:05,388 --> 00:54:17,792
If we do not do what she has decided she thinks should be done in zoning, which is not her purview, she will hold up the entire zoning process and throw those many years of residents' time into the trash can.

550
00:54:18,673 --> 00:54:21,794
I do not believe that that is what this city needs.

551
00:54:22,334 --> 00:54:24,935
That is not the leadership that I think that this city deserves.

552
00:54:25,873 --> 00:54:47,143
What I would like to see from the mayor is a public commitment to fully fund the zoning process so that this city council can do the appropriate public meetings, public outreach, and hire the consultant that we need to do in order to do zoning right.

553
00:54:47,863 --> 00:54:51,705
To take the plans of our residents and to

554
00:54:52,806 --> 00:55:01,041
using public outreach and public meetings to make sure that every single part of that zoning is

555
00:55:03,558 --> 00:55:05,780
fits the micro needs of every neighborhood.

556
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:10,444
That is the job the city council can do only if the mayor funds it.

557
00:55:10,884 --> 00:55:22,173
But we cannot go through a process where every time we want to continue with the zoning process, the mayor says, well, you have to do the thing I want you to do in zoning, and we are held up month after month after month.

558
00:55:22,674 --> 00:55:32,181
She needs to commit publicly, not bullet points in private emails to us, publicly commit to the funding necessary to do zoning right, and then she needs to

559
00:55:33,102 --> 00:55:36,083
let go and allow the City Council to do the City Council's purview.

560
00:55:36,863 --> 00:55:38,244
We have a strong mayor system.

561
00:55:38,584 --> 00:55:42,545
The mayor is in control of a vast majority of things that happen in this city.

562
00:55:43,326 --> 00:55:44,986
Zoning is a purview of the City Council.

563
00:55:48,607 --> 00:55:49,868
Councillor Scarpelli.

564
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:51,669
Thank you, Mr. President.

565
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:56,050
I didn't want to speak tonight, but it's funny.

566
00:55:56,070 --> 00:55:58,971
My colleagues are saying this.

567
00:55:59,031 --> 00:56:01,312
I don't know if you're listening to what you're saying.

568
00:56:02,769 --> 00:56:16,316
You're saying that before the election, we talked about the backpedal and identifying that we didn't have the tools necessary to bring this to the neighborhood.

569
00:56:17,537 --> 00:56:18,337
That's what we all said.

570
00:56:18,997 --> 00:56:19,978
That's what we're all fighting about.

571
00:56:20,578 --> 00:56:22,539
This is why we won in writing, right?

572
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:26,181
So we can get the tools proper so we don't have to come back.

573
00:56:28,502 --> 00:56:31,164
But then I hear my colleagues talking

574
00:56:32,911 --> 00:56:39,772
out of both sides of their mouths in the sense that we did this, we did this, but we want the community's input.

575
00:56:40,433 --> 00:56:42,833
This quarter did get the community input.

576
00:56:43,253 --> 00:56:47,694
It's the only area of zoning that did get the community input.

577
00:56:49,714 --> 00:56:55,255
It's the only zoning area that we went into the neighborhood.

578
00:56:56,416 --> 00:57:02,497
The neighbors came out of their homes into their neighborhood and they shared what they wanted, their vision.

579
00:57:03,410 --> 00:57:05,071
And then I went to the Community Development Board.

580
00:57:06,252 --> 00:57:07,392
They shared what we wanted.

581
00:57:07,412 --> 00:57:12,776
I don't want to revisit it and keep going negative again, because this is going to be turned negatively all over the place again.

582
00:57:12,856 --> 00:57:15,917
But again, this is what we talked about.

583
00:57:16,778 --> 00:57:21,301
And again, we've already identified the people that want the zoning to move forward.

584
00:57:21,361 --> 00:57:22,061
I agree with them.

585
00:57:24,002 --> 00:57:31,667
But the people that were in favor of moving to MX2, the majority of the people didn't live in the Salem Street area.

586
00:57:33,181 --> 00:57:35,642
Go through the notes, listen to the meetings.

587
00:57:36,122 --> 00:57:38,522
The addresses are not coming from Salem Street.

588
00:57:38,942 --> 00:57:43,444
This is the true evidence of what we all want.

589
00:57:43,824 --> 00:57:45,084
And that's more community input.

590
00:57:45,104 --> 00:57:49,765
This is what we're asking for a detailed message from the mayor for communication.

591
00:57:50,565 --> 00:57:58,147
So we can go into those neighborhoods and work together with those neighbors so they can share their vision of what they want their neighborhoods to be zoned.

592
00:57:58,507 --> 00:58:00,128
Listen, it's our purview.

593
00:58:00,688 --> 00:58:01,448
I understand that.

594
00:58:02,942 --> 00:58:07,223
but it's our purview to listen to the residents of those areas, we may make our decisions.

595
00:58:09,504 --> 00:58:25,430
So please, I understand that wanting to wait, I've talked to my colleagues and making something public, if that's what the wishes is, your wishes are that I'll move forward in support of that, but let it be clear.

596
00:58:27,578 --> 00:58:35,766
What we're fighting for and what we're all saying is the opportunity to get the funding that we need to do this correctly so we don't have to come back and visit.

597
00:58:37,948 --> 00:58:52,862
In this area, this zoned area, these changes that we're talking about, the only reason why we're here is because we did go into the neighborhood after we voted, after we made decisions, and we listened to those neighbors that said this is going to hurt their neighborhood and they don't want that.

598
00:58:55,494 --> 00:58:59,399
So if it's to be to table, continue to the next week.

599
00:58:59,799 --> 00:59:01,261
Hopefully the mayor comes public with it.

600
00:59:01,681 --> 00:59:03,844
But let's be clear at this.

601
00:59:05,586 --> 00:59:14,456
What I'm seeing from the mayor is a clear, and hopefully it goes public, a clear indication of what we're asking for.

602
00:59:15,295 --> 00:59:29,179
a detailed plan with funding that goes to a specialist that focuses on getting the message out so we can make the decisions that this council can be proud of for what the neighbors want in their neighborhoods.

603
00:59:31,539 --> 00:59:40,762
If I wasn't a city councilor and I didn't listen to the neighbors in South Medford and just made arbitrary decisions without listening to them, shame on me.

604
00:59:43,295 --> 00:59:50,359
So again, I'm gonna support my colleagues in moving this on until you get something public from what I've seen from the mayor.

605
00:59:51,459 --> 00:59:55,101
She did share that she's listening.

606
00:59:55,882 --> 01:00:06,167
We're gonna have a mechanism in place that's really gonna go out and educate our community, go into the neighborhood, work with our neighbors, so we don't have to come back here with this type of situation.

607
01:00:07,328 --> 01:00:10,412
So again, I don't want to be negative.

608
01:00:10,553 --> 01:00:17,783
It's just that the point is, this is where we were that evening when the residents spoke.

609
01:00:18,361 --> 01:00:19,982
The CD board gave their opinion.

610
01:00:20,442 --> 01:00:23,184
They talked about that changes and I did make a mistake publicly.

611
01:00:23,204 --> 01:00:25,725
I apologize for that because I said everything.

612
01:00:26,206 --> 01:00:32,530
It was one change that reverted back, which is the big changes, which is the MX1 to MX2.

613
01:00:33,170 --> 01:00:37,753
That was the biggest change that the neighborhood really worried about.

614
01:00:38,073 --> 01:00:42,776
And here we are to make the decision and to go back, we're saying the same thing.

615
01:00:43,873 --> 01:00:44,773
We're saying the same thing.

616
01:00:44,793 --> 01:00:58,861
We're saying we're doing this, we're making changes because the mayor is bullying us, but also we want these changes because we want to go into the neighborhoods and do exactly what we did in that area.

617
01:00:59,801 --> 01:01:00,541
So thank you.

618
01:01:01,402 --> 01:01:03,203
Thank you, Council, Vice President Collins.

619
01:01:05,984 --> 01:01:06,825
Thank you, President Behrs.

620
01:01:09,526 --> 01:01:12,908
Look, we spoke about this at length last week, and I think that we were very clear.

621
01:01:13,228 --> 01:01:18,670
And frankly, I'm not really sure why we're being accused of playing hide the ball on this matter.

622
01:01:18,690 --> 01:01:21,792
And we were extremely consistent and clear with our expectations last week.

623
01:01:23,853 --> 01:01:28,695
Myself and other councillors asked for a public commitment before we would take this vote.

624
01:01:29,703 --> 01:01:31,264
We're waiting for that public commitment.

625
01:01:31,324 --> 01:01:36,727
Like I said, I'm really gratified by the progress we've made in the past week, but we haven't gotten to a public commitment yet.

626
01:01:37,167 --> 01:01:37,667
That's okay.

627
01:01:37,867 --> 01:01:42,469
I think that we will, but I'm going to stand by my word and not take a vote until we reach a public commitment.

628
01:01:43,690 --> 01:01:55,055
And I, since it's been brought up, I want to state a reminder that we are only having this discussion because the mayor has turned this into a quid pro quo.

629
01:01:55,836 --> 01:01:58,897
The mayor, like we discussed last week in her late July public letter,

630
01:01:59,622 --> 01:02:03,245
explicitly turned the Salem Street amendment into a quid pro quo.

631
01:02:03,825 --> 01:02:12,812
If we make this amendment, if we approve this change, then we'll be allowed to perform our statutory responsibility of continuing with the rest of the zoning overhaul.

632
01:02:14,854 --> 01:02:19,678
So if it's quid pro quo, I wanna know what we are getting for the amendment.

633
01:02:19,778 --> 01:02:21,579
And I'll restate what I said last week.

634
01:02:21,719 --> 01:02:23,160
I am a yes on this amendment.

635
01:02:24,201 --> 01:02:25,242
I will vote yes on this.

636
01:02:26,063 --> 01:02:27,644
When we get a public commitment from the mayor,

637
01:02:28,318 --> 01:02:41,540
that all of the other zoning proposals will be able to enjoy the same level of robust and comprehensive public engagement that we know the community deserves, and we will have an RFP to support that, then I will vote yes on this amendment.

638
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:56,043
I am making a public commitment to reverse my vote on this, and I'm just asking the mayor to make a public commitment to what she has been sharing and what we have been workshopping together as we work towards a framework for the contract extension and the next RFP.

639
01:02:58,789 --> 01:03:14,559
I will hold out optimism that the mayor will do what we are asking her to do and similarly make a public commitment with details that the contract extension and the next RFP will allow us to do this right and that the city will invest the resources to do this right.

640
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:18,122
And then I will be a yes on this amendment.

641
01:03:18,882 --> 01:03:19,302
It's simple.

642
01:03:19,482 --> 01:03:20,403
It's what we said last week.

643
01:03:21,023 --> 01:03:21,344
Thank you.

644
01:03:23,845 --> 01:03:25,066
Thank you, Councilor Lemming.

645
01:03:28,488 --> 01:03:32,691
I don't mean to rehash this again, but because it does always seem to come up.

646
01:03:32,751 --> 01:03:57,286
So going through the public meetings that are on record that have been recorded, which is the January CDB meeting, the March CDB meeting, the March 11th city council meeting, and last week's meeting where residents spoke for or against the Salem Street

647
01:03:58,586 --> 01:04:00,147
rezoning and rezoning in general.

648
01:04:00,167 --> 01:04:13,354
I mean, the total the total comes out to from what from what I counted from the transcripts to be 29 people who are opposed and 45 people in favor.

649
01:04:13,434 --> 01:04:17,096
Now, it is true that and I mapped out their addresses.

650
01:04:18,617 --> 01:04:31,667
that if you actually take residents who are sort of within the general Salem Street area and you map them out as being for or against, that the majority there are opposed.

651
01:04:31,708 --> 01:04:33,209
But it's not like this lopsided thing.

652
01:04:33,289 --> 01:04:33,849
It's more like 17 to 14.

653
01:04:38,934 --> 01:04:51,693
And I could see my colleague shaking his head and to be fair, there was a meeting at the, there was one meeting that was not recorded that was sort of a Q&A session that

654
01:04:53,683 --> 01:05:03,290
was that people who have told me that people who did attend that said that there was a good amount of negative feedback there.

655
01:05:03,770 --> 01:05:15,719
Somebody else that was in favor of the rezoning process also said that a lot of the people who were in favor there didn't really understand that particular meeting to be a public

656
01:05:16,519 --> 01:05:18,240
to be like a public feedback session.

657
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:23,002
They just thought it was a Q&A, and they were satisfied with what they saw there.

658
01:05:23,042 --> 01:05:24,963
But either way, it was never recorded.

659
01:05:24,983 --> 01:05:31,325
So I just want to say, I'm putting that out there because these meetings are on record.

660
01:05:31,485 --> 01:05:38,068
We can go through and sort of map out what people have actually said.

661
01:05:38,088 --> 01:05:39,008
And it's

662
01:05:42,722 --> 01:05:48,264
Yeah, and also, this doesn't include personal emails that were received.

663
01:05:48,364 --> 01:05:55,566
It may not include letters that the CDB and council were given that were not read out at these public meetings.

664
01:05:55,606 --> 01:06:07,949
But again, when we're talking about the meetings that happened, there does tend to be this sense of people tend to misremember them or tend to mischaracterize what actually happened.

665
01:06:07,989 --> 01:06:09,270
No, the majority of residents,

666
01:06:10,439 --> 01:06:12,881
are in favor of the rezoning process.

667
01:06:13,481 --> 01:06:23,626
And yes, if you actually go directly around the Salem Street area, like the people who were sort of in the general area, it is slightly less favorable, but it's not like this huge lopsided.

668
01:06:24,907 --> 01:06:26,848
It's not like this huge lopsided number.

669
01:06:26,928 --> 01:06:29,509
It's like 60, 40, but anyway, thank you.

670
01:06:30,930 --> 01:06:32,191
Thank you, Councilor Sang.

671
01:06:32,991 --> 01:06:33,451
Thank you.

672
01:06:34,332 --> 01:06:37,453
I fear we're missing the forest for the trees a little bit here.

673
01:06:39,834 --> 01:06:47,037
The letter that the mayor sent and posted in July turned a small node into something bigger.

674
01:06:47,257 --> 01:06:55,260
And if it weren't for this, then I think that we find strong support on the council for voting this out.

675
01:06:55,600 --> 01:07:00,943
I mean, we had the conversation last week about the policy of the area, how the facts on the ground have changed.

676
01:07:01,703 --> 01:07:01,903
But

677
01:07:03,195 --> 01:07:12,520
Now that the mayor has turned this into a quid pro quo, I don't think it's unfair for us to have a complete picture about what the quo is, what that looks like.

678
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:26,807
And I think the council was clear last week, and I think this was after a discussion, the council was very clear that its stance was that we needed a public commitment about what the quo looked like.

679
01:07:27,931 --> 01:07:33,514
I want to make sure that our relationship and how we govern in the city isn't coercive, but it's cooperative.

680
01:07:34,235 --> 01:07:37,337
And I do believe that we're so, so close on this.

681
01:07:38,237 --> 01:07:42,940
We're just waiting on the mayor to take the final step or two, and then I think we can cross the finish line.

682
01:07:45,722 --> 01:07:46,402
Thank you, Councilor Sands.

683
01:07:46,422 --> 01:07:47,083
Councilor Scarpa.

684
01:07:47,903 --> 01:07:50,085
Thank you for bringing that full circle.

685
01:07:50,105 --> 01:07:51,786
I appreciate that because I think we were getting off.

686
01:07:54,394 --> 01:07:56,875
to make it clear that my fellow council loves numbers, 16, 14.

687
01:07:57,675 --> 01:08:03,877
The petition that was signed in that area, how many people reached out if we know Madam Chief of Staff?

688
01:08:10,639 --> 01:08:13,000
I believe you said it was like 1,100, is that right?

689
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:13,600
1,100, okay, thank you.

690
01:08:15,741 --> 01:08:17,501
Thank you, all right.

691
01:08:21,382 --> 01:08:22,863
Any further comments by members of the council?

692
01:08:24,813 --> 01:08:26,393
Seeing none, would you like to speak?

693
01:08:26,413 --> 01:08:28,354
Madam Chief of Staff.

694
01:08:28,674 --> 01:08:29,454
Thank you, President Paris.

695
01:08:30,294 --> 01:08:31,294
I don't want to belabor the point.

696
01:08:31,975 --> 01:08:39,956
It sounds like there's really not much movement that's going to happen here tonight, but truly, I honestly don't see why not.

697
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:42,357
And I say that not to

698
01:08:48,610 --> 01:08:53,321
offend any of you, frankly, but to say we do have all of this information right here.

699
01:08:53,582 --> 01:08:57,712
And as you know, the mayor sent a two-page email.

700
01:09:00,148 --> 01:09:04,250
on November 12th in anticipation of the discussion.

701
01:09:04,970 --> 01:09:14,714
As I said before, the councilors stated that they were looking for a bulleted, I got that there was a bulleted request, and that's my takeaway.

702
01:09:15,874 --> 01:09:18,195
I understand that there was a lot that was stated at the last meeting.

703
01:09:18,295 --> 01:09:21,556
I understand that the council needed to vent for that matter.

704
01:09:22,136 --> 01:09:22,737
But, you know,

705
01:09:24,137 --> 01:09:26,358
The council wanted the information in bulleted form.

706
01:09:26,958 --> 01:09:38,060
The mayor took the time to incorporate all of that information, sit down and discuss it with the members of our planning, development and sustainability department staff.

707
01:09:40,081 --> 01:09:44,782
Sent that email out in the early hours of this morning to make sure that the council had it.

708
01:09:45,102 --> 01:09:47,123
I would like to go through reading at least a part of it.

709
01:09:47,323 --> 01:09:52,284
I would be happy to read all of it because I think it's all here and all can be stated publicly.

710
01:09:53,885 --> 01:09:59,489
So it begins with contract extension December 2025 to June 2026 Medford Square.

711
01:09:59,509 --> 01:10:04,392
These are bullets building commissioner and PDS cleanup after Medford Square.

712
01:10:05,667 --> 01:10:07,188
Well, bullet one, Medford Square.

713
01:10:07,228 --> 01:10:09,330
Bullet two, building commissioner and PDS cleanup.

714
01:10:09,590 --> 01:10:16,356
Bullet three, after Medford Square, Tufts Institutional slash Boston Avenue request of PDS in parentheses.

715
01:10:17,197 --> 01:10:19,339
Bullet four, robust community engagement.

716
01:10:19,759 --> 01:10:23,202
Then a new header, RFP process during extension.

717
01:10:23,662 --> 01:10:26,444
Bullet 1, RFP released by end of February.

718
01:10:26,564 --> 01:10:28,785
Bullet 2, proposal selected in April.

719
01:10:29,406 --> 01:10:39,993
New header, new contract based on new RFP, June 2026 to June 2028, 24-month time frame, one option to extend request of PDS.

720
01:10:40,333 --> 01:10:46,377
And then it goes on with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 bullets talking about the communications

721
01:10:48,378 --> 01:10:53,261
communications person that the council has, communications consultant that the council has requested.

722
01:10:53,602 --> 01:11:01,147
It talks about all remaining quarters, one at a time, Wellington, West Medford Square, after the SWOT analysis, after all quarters.

723
01:11:01,187 --> 01:11:03,868
It talks about residential and historic conversion and parking.

724
01:11:03,908 --> 01:11:05,850
It talks about transportation demand management.

725
01:11:06,350 --> 01:11:10,033
It talks about inclusionary zoning updates, and then it talks about notes at the bottom.

726
01:11:10,053 --> 01:11:11,954
It has five bullets or so on notes.

727
01:11:13,095 --> 01:11:20,120
One of the notes which is important to the mayor is no new amendments taken in July and August to allow for a break for our board, city staff, et cetera.

728
01:11:21,221 --> 01:11:22,943
Department heads looped in from the onset.

729
01:11:23,643 --> 01:11:26,165
Less dense residential map will be our starting point.

730
01:11:27,266 --> 01:11:32,510
We can look at doing a parking study, review of affordable overlay.

731
01:11:33,698 --> 01:11:35,119
I think that's all right here in writing.

732
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:58,756
And I think this council can see that what we're looking to do, hopefully, is that we want to put more weight to be given to the community around the change itself.

733
01:11:59,781 --> 01:12:03,784
The mayor receives thousands of emails per week, and she reads and digests all of those emails.

734
01:12:06,406 --> 01:12:10,529
She feels like this group has negotiated in good faith over the course of these last couple of weeks.

735
01:12:12,191 --> 01:12:18,356
I think there's been a comment that this hasn't been a public process, and I would completely disagree with that.

736
01:12:18,376 --> 01:12:22,659
I think this council has the opportunity to have its public discussions and public process in these meetings.

737
01:12:23,119 --> 01:12:24,440
And with that comes its challenges.

738
01:12:24,460 --> 01:12:27,403
You all are constrained by the open meeting law, so that's a challenge for you all.

739
01:12:27,823 --> 01:12:33,230
But the mayor doesn't have a council, it's not the same dynamic.

740
01:12:33,330 --> 01:12:42,643
And the mayor has presented the issues that she sees with this process publicly to be transparent and to communicate with you all and with the residents of Medford.

741
01:12:43,483 --> 01:12:48,986
We are well aware, and this is specifically to Vice President Collins, we are well aware that this is not going to be cheap.

742
01:12:49,526 --> 01:13:00,951
And I just say that to say, you know, I realize that maybe the council is not going to make this change tonight, but I really don't know why we have to have this go on for longer.

743
01:13:00,991 --> 01:13:04,312
And I say that with all due respect, I'm not trying to take anything away from you all.

744
01:13:04,532 --> 01:13:05,893
Thank you for your patience.

745
01:13:07,774 --> 01:13:09,895
Thank you, Councilor Lazaro.

746
01:13:14,085 --> 01:13:14,425
Thank you.

747
01:13:14,626 --> 01:13:20,812
If you could read that out, why could the mayor not release that publicly, that whole list before right now?

748
01:13:21,132 --> 01:13:22,193
That's what we asked for.

749
01:13:22,473 --> 01:13:23,474
She did not do it.

750
01:13:25,596 --> 01:13:26,437
That's what we asked for.

751
01:13:26,978 --> 01:13:28,059
She didn't do it, Nina.

752
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,001
You just read it out.

753
01:13:30,221 --> 01:13:31,242
This is a public meeting.

754
01:13:31,282 --> 01:13:33,764
Why couldn't she release that from her office?

755
01:13:34,825 --> 01:13:35,766
That's what we asked for.

756
01:13:36,903 --> 01:13:42,527
If you could read it in a public meeting, why could the mayor not release it from her office?

757
01:13:42,787 --> 01:13:45,589
We ask for something, we say, we'll do this thing for you.

758
01:13:46,190 --> 01:13:50,433
We've already agreed to a quid pro quo for the mayor.

759
01:13:51,454 --> 01:14:02,362
There are so many compromises already happening in a project that is our job, that she is making us do, and we are agreeing to it.

760
01:14:03,450 --> 01:14:07,872
And the one thing I asked for was make, yeah, I said, yeah, yes, thank you for the list.

761
01:14:08,492 --> 01:14:11,074
Make a public statement, and she didn't do it.

762
01:14:11,314 --> 01:14:12,134
You just read it out.

763
01:14:12,254 --> 01:14:13,115
Why couldn't she do it?

764
01:14:15,756 --> 01:14:17,176
Do you, Councilor Lemming?

765
01:14:20,758 --> 01:14:27,961
Yeah, I think my colleague just phrased it, pretty much what the sentiments I would express.

766
01:14:30,413 --> 01:14:33,816
a lot more emphatically than my style allows.

767
01:14:33,916 --> 01:14:41,921
But yeah, and I do understand that you're in a bit of a tricky position being here.

768
01:14:42,142 --> 01:14:47,265
But this whole framing is of the mayor's design.

769
01:14:48,266 --> 01:14:51,328
She could have signed this contract of her own volition after having

770
01:14:53,368 --> 01:14:56,414
one-on-one meetings with individual counselors months ago.

771
01:14:56,434 --> 01:15:03,446
This whole thing is odd because it kind of feels like this is a...

772
01:15:05,368 --> 01:15:12,696
This is a hole that she's kind of dug herself into, and she's frustrated that she can't get out of it.

773
01:15:12,856 --> 01:15:23,788
It's just very strange to me that we're having a conversation this absurd about undoing an intersection that we voted on in March.

774
01:15:26,150 --> 01:15:38,539
in return for this whole rezoning process that includes implementing the Medford Comprehensive Plan and implementing zoning for the trans and real estate deal.

775
01:15:40,581 --> 01:15:46,625
This is a very silly game of chicken that she started.

776
01:15:46,645 --> 01:15:49,848
And we're just saying, we just want you to publicly

777
01:15:50,628 --> 01:15:55,691
release the list of things that you will do in return for this, just to make sure that we're not going to get burned.

778
01:15:55,711 --> 01:15:59,653
And sorry.

779
01:16:02,034 --> 01:16:03,695
Why are you silencing me?

780
01:16:06,236 --> 01:16:07,797
How dare you silence?

781
01:16:07,817 --> 01:16:10,179
I love to hear the sound of my own voice.

782
01:16:10,199 --> 01:16:11,659
I was just trying to turn it down a little bit.

783
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:14,761
It's a little echoey.

784
01:16:15,762 --> 01:16:16,202
But yeah.

785
01:16:17,620 --> 01:16:26,392
I don't really have much more to say that a public commitment and this whole thing that was the mayor's own doing could be resolved.

786
01:16:26,432 --> 01:16:26,793
Thank you.

787
01:16:26,813 --> 01:16:29,657
Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

788
01:16:31,124 --> 01:16:31,404
Thank you.

789
01:16:32,245 --> 01:16:39,267
I respectfully will request that my fellow city councilors do not speak for all of us.

790
01:16:41,788 --> 01:16:43,929
It would be lovely if people can speak for themselves.

791
01:16:46,490 --> 01:16:50,291
I personally am not agreeing to any quid pro quo.

792
01:16:51,012 --> 01:16:59,355
I think that in American politics, it has become absolutely normalized to say, if you do me this sort of thing, then I will give up some policy I care about.

793
01:17:02,328 --> 01:17:04,249
I will not do quid pro quos.

794
01:17:04,989 --> 01:17:11,192
I will not give up any policy that I care about for someone else to give me some policy that they care about.

795
01:17:11,212 --> 01:17:16,494
I am going to vote on the policies I care about based upon what I believe my constituents deserve.

796
01:17:18,055 --> 01:17:25,618
So this is not a quid pro quo for me, and you will have to wait until we actually vote on it to find out how I feel about this particular intersection.

797
01:17:27,570 --> 01:17:34,391
In my opinion, many, many of the bullet points are not commitments from the mayor.

798
01:17:34,511 --> 01:17:37,052
They are conditions she is putting on the city council.

799
01:17:39,112 --> 01:17:49,414
She is stating that in order for this all to happen, we have to agree to X, Y, and Z. We have to agree that we're gonna start from a certain place in the residential zoning.

800
01:17:49,454 --> 01:17:50,635
We're gonna do them in this order.

801
01:17:50,655 --> 01:17:52,455
We're gonna do X, Y, Z, blah, blah, blah.

802
01:17:53,616 --> 01:17:57,459
Those bullet points are not what I am looking for.

803
01:17:59,982 --> 01:18:04,305
The mayor needs to commit to fully fund the zoning process.

804
01:18:04,966 --> 01:18:06,868
Zoning is under the purview of the city council.

805
01:18:07,889 --> 01:18:10,111
We were just elected.

806
01:18:13,193 --> 01:18:18,418
And I have to say what I hope is clear, which is,

807
01:18:21,537 --> 01:18:24,638
There were people who were running against zoning.

808
01:18:26,279 --> 01:18:27,959
They made this election about zoning.

809
01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:49,567
And there were people who, including myself, were running on the idea that the comprehensive plan and the many plans that came before it were a vision of the city that residents came up with, that we believe in,

810
01:18:51,892 --> 01:18:59,618
and that needs to be supported by a comprehensive zoning of the city.

811
01:19:02,601 --> 01:19:11,468
So what I want from the mayor is not a bullet list of conditions she's putting on the city council in order for us to have the funding we need to do zoning.

812
01:19:12,669 --> 01:19:17,113
What I want from the mayor is what she will commit to doing.

813
01:19:18,956 --> 01:19:32,743
and to leave the zoning to the group, the elected body that is in charge of zoning and to trust us that we will do zoning as it should be done.

814
01:19:34,404 --> 01:19:35,225
It is our purview.

815
01:19:35,885 --> 01:19:37,026
She needs to fully fund it.

816
01:19:37,366 --> 01:19:46,251
She's to publicly commit to fully funding it, which includes not just the consultants and the, you know, whatever, but we're talking about what we didn't have last time

817
01:19:47,950 --> 01:19:54,214
which is communications and neighborhood meetings.

818
01:19:56,155 --> 01:20:06,061
She needs to commit to fully funding those things and stop asking us, putting all these bullet points in, that we have to agree to.

819
01:20:07,902 --> 01:20:16,708
That is what I personally am asking for, and what my other city councilors want to do is up to them, but for me personally, that is what I have requested.

820
01:20:20,527 --> 01:20:30,053
Vice President Collins.

821
01:20:30,073 --> 01:20:30,814
Vice President Collins.

822
01:20:33,195 --> 01:20:34,536
Oh, sorry about that.

823
01:20:35,037 --> 01:20:35,537
Can you hear me now?

824
01:20:36,417 --> 01:20:36,578
Yes.

825
01:20:37,378 --> 01:20:37,658
Great.

826
01:20:38,499 --> 01:20:38,819
Thank you.

827
01:20:38,839 --> 01:20:43,842
I appreciate the discussion around this from my fellow counselors.

828
01:20:46,945 --> 01:20:55,111
I think what I'm hearing is a sense of confusion of what we are waiting for in order to take the vote.

829
01:20:57,052 --> 01:21:00,855
I am feeling confusion because I feel that we have stated that a number of ways.

830
01:21:02,456 --> 01:21:13,905
But since we're now kind of drawing on the primary sources and pulling up the emails, I feel like there's a narrative being advanced that like, well, the mayor wrote a list

831
01:21:15,872 --> 01:21:40,652
Isn't that the same as a public commitment that clearly and publicly states details around what we mean when we say public engagement and what we mean when we say community engagement and what we mean when we say neighborhood shredding and what we mean in terms of numbers when we're talking about how and how much we are going to invest on this very important project of planning our city's future?

832
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:50,109
I am very familiar with the bullet pointed list that was conveyed to councillors, because I drafted that.

833
01:21:51,971 --> 01:22:01,563
The day of our last meeting on the 12th, indeed, the mayor sent us a two page email if we're apparently we're judging quality by length now.

834
01:22:02,509 --> 01:22:07,710
Um, to be totally honest, I had trouble following it, which is fine.

835
01:22:08,310 --> 01:22:10,131
Me and the mayor had a productive exchange.

836
01:22:10,311 --> 01:22:15,412
I sent over some clarifying questions because I was not clear on what she was proposing and I wanted some clarity.

837
01:22:16,332 --> 01:22:18,773
She offered some details, very appreciated.

838
01:22:19,533 --> 01:22:29,195
I followed up on Friday to say, okay, you know, I think we're making some headway here, but I think that there's confusion about what it is that you are proposing and how that compares to what we were asking for.

839
01:22:29,987 --> 01:22:37,770
I think it'd be helpful for the council to be able to see, review, and respond to a clearly written proposal for the extension of the next RFP before moving forward on Salem.

840
01:22:38,430 --> 01:22:39,631
And I can see that looking like this.

841
01:22:41,072 --> 01:22:58,979
And I sent her a jumping off point, bullet pointed, indeed, for the contract extension and for the next RFP because, and I'm not trying to be a jerk here, but I think we need to be really clear about what we are asking for and what she is proposing so that we can come to an actual agreement

842
01:23:00,025 --> 01:23:08,469
that is not based on vibes, that is not vague, that is serious and formal and public because this is very important.

843
01:23:10,770 --> 01:23:13,651
Nobody here is trying to do political theater for its own sake.

844
01:23:14,811 --> 01:23:28,177
We are trying to secure a public commitment to resources that are necessary for a community-engaged zoning process because of how important that is and because

845
01:23:30,170 --> 01:23:35,232
The council's communication with the mayor so far this term around zoning has not been based on trust.

846
01:23:36,172 --> 01:23:45,215
Tonight we're talking about the Salem Street zoning amendment, which the mayor explicitly said was a condition of her agreeing to advance the further rezoning project.

847
01:23:46,296 --> 01:23:55,359
But we're leaving off a ton of other vaguenesses or other quid pro quos that the mayor advanced that were, you know,

848
01:23:56,955 --> 01:23:58,836
put forward as conditions for the zoning going forward.

849
01:23:58,856 --> 01:24:00,037
It's not only Salem.

850
01:24:01,078 --> 01:24:18,931
Something that I really wanted to nail down, and this is why I was communicating with the mayor this past week, was not only on the details of how much are we going to invest in community engagement so that we know it happens, that we know it happens better, and how much are we going to invest in this RFP so that we know that we're really getting what the community deserves, but also, let's get really clear.

851
01:24:20,012 --> 01:24:26,297
Is revisiting Mystic Ave a condition of continuing the rezoning as well?

852
01:24:27,442 --> 01:24:41,686
And when you say that any further discussions of the residential zoning will start from this place and not that place, are you stating that as a condition of moving forward?

853
01:24:42,686 --> 01:24:44,066
Is that a request?

854
01:24:44,906 --> 01:24:48,747
Am I to interpret that as a stipulation or a condition as well?

855
01:24:49,327 --> 01:24:55,449
I'm looking for clarity because that, I mean, I just feel like it should go without saying.

856
01:24:56,327 --> 01:25:00,848
we're talking about implementing the comprehensive plan, which is at least five years in the works.

857
01:25:01,608 --> 01:25:04,248
This is incredibly, this is the future of the city.

858
01:25:04,629 --> 01:25:11,370
This will guide what buildings surround us decades into the future and the roads that we walk on and how our neighborhoods feel.

859
01:25:16,551 --> 01:25:22,752
And I, you know, it just, sad to say, it underlines

860
01:25:23,768 --> 01:25:46,428
the lack of trust that undergirds, you know, why I, as one councillor, am asking for a public commitment, that we're receiving this kind of narrative saying, you know, oh, how could you, denigrating our requests for a public commitment that is clear, that is legible, that anybody can understand and not be confused by and not feel as vague,

861
01:25:49,105 --> 01:26:06,600
Having that effort to have this be clear and transparent in public, denigrated and dismissed in a City Council meeting, unfortunately, underlines why I felt it was so necessary to get a public commitment on this in the first place before moving forward on Salem Street.

862
01:26:09,082 --> 01:26:09,923
So I'm going to stick with that.

863
01:26:12,045 --> 01:26:16,769
And, you know, it is sad to me that this has been allowed to

864
01:26:17,668 --> 01:26:27,934
be turned into such an incredibly sour process when the process of implementing our visions for the city should be something that are allowed to be collaborative and positive.

865
01:26:28,494 --> 01:26:30,735
And I will not give up hope that we can get to this place.

866
01:26:31,456 --> 01:26:42,622
But like I said last week, I will give up absolutely zero of my leverage when it comes to making sure that we will have the investment and the resources that we need to do this right.

867
01:26:44,183 --> 01:26:46,144
Because we can't trust this administration

868
01:26:47,837 --> 01:26:49,378
to do it right for its own sake.

869
01:26:50,038 --> 01:26:50,358
Thank you.

870
01:26:52,559 --> 01:26:53,519
Councillor Callahan.

871
01:26:56,721 --> 01:27:03,944
Just one last thing, which is what I'm really worried might be happening is

872
01:27:06,602 --> 01:27:12,647
We're told that we have to change what we said on Salem Street in this one corner, or else we can't move forward.

873
01:27:13,128 --> 01:27:24,438
And then we'll be told, oh, we have to vote for whatever zoning is going to allow the rebuilding by transom of Medford Square, but nothing else.

874
01:27:25,496 --> 01:27:31,700
And then we're told we have to redo Mystic Ave the way that the mayor wants, or else nothing else can move forward.

875
01:27:32,260 --> 01:27:36,823
And then we're told we have to do Medford Square the way the mayor wants, or else we can't move forward.

876
01:27:37,524 --> 01:27:39,445
I don't see an end to this.

877
01:27:39,845 --> 01:27:41,066
I think we have to end it now.

878
01:27:41,106 --> 01:27:47,830
We have to just say, look, mayor controls vast majority of the city, but not zoning.

879
01:27:48,171 --> 01:27:49,331
Zoning is privy of city council.

880
01:27:49,732 --> 01:27:50,872
City council just got reelected.

881
01:27:52,213 --> 01:27:53,674
Mayor will fund the project.

882
01:27:53,714 --> 01:27:54,855
City council will do the project.

883
01:27:56,708 --> 01:27:56,969
Thank you.

884
01:28:00,306 --> 01:28:00,626
Thank you.

885
01:28:00,706 --> 01:28:06,608
Councillor Callahan is completely correct that quid pro quo governance is a stain on society.

886
01:28:06,668 --> 01:28:07,668
It's a stain on democracy.

887
01:28:07,708 --> 01:28:08,809
It's not how things should work.

888
01:28:09,349 --> 01:28:13,911
We should be voting on things as she said, because they're the right things to do for the community.

889
01:28:15,091 --> 01:28:29,656
And what she just said, those are the fears that I fear as an individual Councillor as well that we're, you know, moving into this way of running the city that's really bouncing back and forth between deals and things that aren't comprehensive or public.

890
01:28:30,377 --> 01:28:33,476
and open and what this

891
01:28:34,532 --> 01:28:40,814
Whole debacle, what this whole situation is about, at least from the council's end, is finding a way to break past that.

892
01:28:41,415 --> 01:28:42,775
And how do we break past that?

893
01:28:43,375 --> 01:28:45,076
We need to build a trusting relationship.

894
01:28:45,756 --> 01:29:00,822
And a trusting relationship starts with open dialogue and discourse, starting from our shared values and our shared plans, shared goals, like the comprehensive plan that so many people worked on, like the climate action plan, which needs to be integrated into zoning reform as well.

895
01:29:02,263 --> 01:29:08,049
And, you know, starts by having that open conversation in public with public commitments.

896
01:29:09,931 --> 01:29:16,577
And it also requires that we are clear about what we are doing moving forward.

897
01:29:16,677 --> 01:29:19,480
And so, you know, I think the bulleted list is really helpful.

898
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:24,625
But as Councilor, Vice President Collins referred to, there are some points in there that aren't completely clear.

899
01:29:25,227 --> 01:29:28,468
about what that picture looks like.

900
01:29:28,548 --> 01:29:31,749
Is the communications part of it?

901
01:29:32,089 --> 01:29:36,891
Is that gonna be part of this deal or in this package or another package?

902
01:29:37,351 --> 01:29:40,552
What is affordable housing overlay look like?

903
01:29:40,672 --> 01:29:43,093
What's the scope of the parking studies?

904
01:29:43,353 --> 01:29:44,593
Is that the same as residential?

905
01:29:44,653 --> 01:29:45,193
Is it different?

906
01:29:45,273 --> 01:29:53,256
These kinds of things are the specific details that we need clarity on and only through clarity here

907
01:29:54,007 --> 01:30:07,458
can we really turn the page and govern Medford in that cooperative manner where we're, you know, evaluating each idea one by one about whether it's the best for the city and whether everything works with each other.

908
01:30:07,938 --> 01:30:13,823
So, you know, I think, again, I think we are close, but we need to establish a more trusting relationship here.

909
01:30:17,566 --> 01:30:18,067
Thank you.

910
01:30:18,087 --> 01:30:19,748
Any further comments by councilors?

911
01:30:21,690 --> 01:30:23,111
Seeing none, Madam Chief of Staff, anything?

912
01:30:25,376 --> 01:30:25,656
Sure.

913
01:30:26,276 --> 01:30:29,858
There's been a lot that's been said, and I appreciate the feedback from the councilors.

914
01:30:30,018 --> 01:30:32,640
I want to correct the record to say this is not a quid pro quo.

915
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:39,703
I think the councilors can choose to narrate this how they wish.

916
01:30:39,823 --> 01:30:42,204
They can choose to put words in the mayor's mouth.

917
01:30:42,985 --> 01:30:44,765
But the reality is this is negotiations.

918
01:30:47,147 --> 01:30:47,927
We've been negotiating.

919
01:30:49,683 --> 01:30:52,825
Vice President Collins, I appreciate you saying it because I was going to bring it up.

920
01:30:53,505 --> 01:31:03,190
The list that we provided was off of the list that Vice President Collins sent to the mayor in an email and said something like this would probably work.

921
01:31:03,290 --> 01:31:18,959
And I think just the paragraph, I think that if counselors can see your proposal in writing and have some back and forth on it early next week to make sure all are in place of comfort, then we have a chance of tying a bow on the Salem Street Amendment at our next meeting.

922
01:31:19,620 --> 01:31:23,706
Maybe there could even be a joint press release about the agreed-upon structure for how to go forward.

923
01:31:24,167 --> 01:31:24,748
That was a maybe.

924
01:31:25,369 --> 01:31:30,417
Otherwise, I don't believe in our conversation, Councilor Lozaro, that we talked about something publicly.

925
01:31:30,457 --> 01:31:31,558
We talked about a bulleted list.

926
01:31:35,023 --> 01:31:48,812
Clearly, we need to go and work this further, but I think the realities are here that we have a slightly different perspective of what's taken place here, and these are not a list of bulleted conditions.

927
01:31:48,892 --> 01:31:55,936
They're a list of things that we used as a guide point, gold posts, based on communication from Vice President Collins.

928
01:31:57,437 --> 01:31:59,799
They're things that Vice President Collins laid out

929
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:06,384
There are things that the mayor wanted and there are things that the mayor heard from the group when she was discussing with each of you individually.

930
01:32:06,404 --> 01:32:10,266
I don't think there's anything left for me to say.

931
01:32:10,286 --> 01:32:15,530
I'm not gonna go point by point, but I respectfully disagree with many of the comments that were made.

932
01:32:16,030 --> 01:32:16,551
Thank you very much.

933
01:32:16,571 --> 01:32:19,613
Thank you.

934
01:32:23,915 --> 01:32:26,137
There's a motion of Vice President Collins.

935
01:32:30,708 --> 01:32:31,569
Thank you, President bears.

936
01:32:31,609 --> 01:32:32,911
And the last thing I'll say about it tonight.

937
01:32:33,651 --> 01:32:40,539
Yes, I stand by everything that I wrote that I've written in emails to Maryland go current and I have no problem with them being read aloud at city council meetings.

938
01:32:42,001 --> 01:32:48,869
I sent more communication to the mayor today after we got an email from her earlier this morning with some

939
01:32:50,957 --> 01:33:00,522
further detail, but not, I think, enough detail on her framework for the contract extension and the next zoning RFP.

940
01:33:00,942 --> 01:33:03,483
And I am not saying that as a pejorative.

941
01:33:04,004 --> 01:33:07,365
I said at the top of my remarks, we're closing the distance, we're getting there.

942
01:33:07,625 --> 01:33:12,268
I think by our next regular meeting, I'm optimistic that we will have gotten there.

943
01:33:13,629 --> 01:33:18,831
In the email that I sent this afternoon, I stated several more specific questions.

944
01:33:19,411 --> 01:33:20,312
I am confident

945
01:33:20,940 --> 01:33:26,323
that if we give this until our next regular meeting, we can continue a productive exchange and get there.

946
01:33:28,344 --> 01:33:38,149
All I'm asking for is to have the time to continue those negotiations and get to that place of consensus before we take this vote.

947
01:33:40,170 --> 01:33:40,430
That's it.

948
01:33:41,663 --> 01:33:45,665
It's like, I'm sorry that it's not spicier than that.

949
01:33:46,065 --> 01:33:49,186
We've been going back and forth, asking questions and answering them.

950
01:33:49,747 --> 01:33:52,648
And I'd like to continue that process before I take this vote.

951
01:33:52,668 --> 01:33:53,789
It's what I've been saying all along.

952
01:33:54,329 --> 01:33:58,671
So, sorry, that's not better TV material, but that's all it is.

953
01:33:58,791 --> 01:34:00,472
And that's what the chief of staff is speaking to.

954
01:34:00,532 --> 01:34:05,054
And I look forward to continuing that process and try to get this in the best place possible for the residents.

955
01:34:05,314 --> 01:34:05,594
Thank you.

956
01:34:09,622 --> 01:34:10,102
Thank you.

957
01:34:10,262 --> 01:34:19,246
And I think I just want to add, um, you know, one of the things that came up tonight was councilor Kelly and saying, don't speak for everyone.

958
01:34:19,586 --> 01:34:19,826
Right.

959
01:34:20,406 --> 01:34:31,110
Um, and I think something that I realized pretty soon after, um, the mayor said, that's why I will not move forward with signing the extension until unless the following items are met.

960
01:34:31,714 --> 01:34:36,435
And it included the council accepting the Community Development Board's last recommendation on Salem Street rezoning.

961
01:34:36,455 --> 01:34:37,755
I'm just saying, it's very clear.

962
01:34:37,775 --> 01:34:40,676
I will not move forward unless the following items are met.

963
01:34:41,836 --> 01:34:46,177
We can call that whatever we want, but it's pretty clearly an exchange.

964
01:34:47,698 --> 01:34:51,979
We can use the Latin term for exchange if we want to or not, but it's an exchange.

965
01:34:52,059 --> 01:34:53,979
It's I will not do this unless you do that.

966
01:34:54,939 --> 01:34:55,959
It's on the city website.

967
01:34:56,079 --> 01:34:56,880
I'm reading it right now.

968
01:35:01,425 --> 01:35:13,950
It was clear to me by mid-August that I was not going to be able to, as an individual, negotiate on behalf of this body on this issue because it's too big.

969
01:35:15,051 --> 01:35:21,894
I applaud Vice President Collins for going back and forth with the mayor's office.

970
01:35:22,134 --> 01:35:26,336
When you're negotiating in this way, what needs to happen is a proposal needs to be presented

971
01:35:27,573 --> 01:35:34,238
and then counselors need to be able to respond to that proposal and say, here are my issues with it.

972
01:35:36,100 --> 01:35:38,102
And then the mayor makes amendments to that proposal.

973
01:35:38,142 --> 01:35:41,004
And then there's a vote, right?

974
01:35:41,104 --> 01:35:43,005
Like that's what a negotiation looks like.

975
01:35:43,066 --> 01:35:46,288
And I think what's been breaking down here pretty clearly.

976
01:35:46,308 --> 01:35:48,670
And I honestly, I've kind of tried to stay out of it.

977
01:35:48,710 --> 01:35:50,191
I had one conversation with the mayor.

978
01:35:50,471 --> 01:35:54,675
Some of my stuff was in some of the emails that the mayor sent, you know,

979
01:35:56,788 --> 01:36:07,113
It's been made very clear that at least two or three members of this council, and I think it's ranging from Councilor Lemming mentioned wanting to see actually the contract language itself.

980
01:36:07,953 --> 01:36:11,155
Councilor Lazaro said, those bullet points seem comprehensive.

981
01:36:11,175 --> 01:36:12,255
I'd like them to be read out.

982
01:36:12,795 --> 01:36:18,338
Councilor Callahan said, I want it to be very clear what is being funded, how much is being funded.

983
01:36:19,679 --> 01:36:22,320
Councilor Scarpelli talked about neighborhood meetings.

984
01:36:22,500 --> 01:36:24,481
Councilor Seng talked about more clarity.

985
01:36:26,083 --> 01:36:28,144
there needs to be something to negotiate with.

986
01:36:29,165 --> 01:36:39,970
And that a public position, here is what the mayor's proposal is, and to move this forward, unless the following items are met, right?

987
01:36:40,850 --> 01:36:43,272
That's also part of the negotiation process.

988
01:36:43,432 --> 01:36:53,677
It seems to me, Councilor Collins said that she felt that what the mayor and she had exchanged emails over, they were pretty close to something that Councilor Collins could accept.

989
01:36:54,484 --> 01:36:57,405
I think I heard that in varying terms from many councilors tonight.

990
01:36:57,445 --> 01:37:06,849
Maybe it's a little farther for Councilor Callahan, but a proposal needs to be announced and then there needs to be a chance for councilors to respond to it.

991
01:37:06,949 --> 01:37:14,552
The mayor could continue the, you know, one-on-one tour that the mayor was doing the other week and say, okay, here's what I wrote.

992
01:37:15,372 --> 01:37:17,433
Is that enough to move forward?

993
01:37:18,433 --> 01:37:23,515
Because as she wrote in July, I will not move forward with signing the extension unless the following items are met.

994
01:37:24,637 --> 01:37:25,237
It's a direct quote.

995
01:37:26,518 --> 01:37:28,740
I think it needs to be clear what that is.

996
01:37:29,181 --> 01:37:35,305
And you know, there needs to be a written proposal that people feel like is enough for them to respond to.

997
01:37:35,365 --> 01:37:40,910
And it's pretty clear tonight that at least three or four, maybe five counselors don't feel that there is.

998
01:37:43,011 --> 01:37:47,335
I'm happy to engage one-on-one with the mayor when a public proposal has been released.

999
01:37:47,395 --> 01:37:49,817
And I can say, here's the things I agree with, here's the things that I don't.

1000
01:37:51,491 --> 01:37:56,392
when it became clear to me like four months ago that that wasn't gonna happen, I kind of just said, okay, I'll wait for that.

1001
01:37:56,692 --> 01:37:57,852
So I'm still waiting.

1002
01:37:59,333 --> 01:38:01,013
There was a motion to continue the public hearing.

1003
01:38:01,033 --> 01:38:02,633
We're not gonna reopen it.

1004
01:38:02,693 --> 01:38:06,234
It's just gonna continue as the motion by Vice President Collins.

1005
01:38:06,274 --> 01:38:07,114
Is there a second on it?

1006
01:38:07,134 --> 01:38:09,695
This is Councilor Callahan.

1007
01:38:09,835 --> 01:38:14,756
It's a motion to continue the public hearing to December 2nd, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

1008
01:38:15,456 --> 01:38:17,076
Is there any further discussion by members of the council?

1009
01:38:20,904 --> 01:38:22,804
Seeing none, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1010
01:38:27,246 --> 01:38:27,946
Councilor Kelly.

1011
01:38:27,966 --> 01:38:28,126
Yes.

1012
01:38:29,806 --> 01:38:30,887
Vice President Collins.

1013
01:38:31,307 --> 01:38:31,527
Yes.

1014
01:38:33,167 --> 01:38:34,107
Councilor Zaro.

1015
01:38:34,127 --> 01:38:34,187
Yes.

1016
01:38:35,948 --> 01:38:36,628
Councilor Lemming.

1017
01:38:36,648 --> 01:38:36,708
Yes.

1018
01:38:38,409 --> 01:38:39,269
Councilor Scapelli.

1019
01:38:39,289 --> 01:38:39,389
Yes.

1020
01:38:40,909 --> 01:38:41,649
Councilor Singh.

1021
01:38:41,669 --> 01:38:41,729
Yes.

1022
01:38:43,090 --> 01:38:43,730
President Peers.

1023
01:38:44,290 --> 01:38:44,530
Yes.

1024
01:38:44,650 --> 01:38:47,871
Having the affirmative and the negative, the public hearing is continued to December 2nd.

1025
01:38:49,973 --> 01:38:52,816
25159, hearing notice.

1026
01:38:53,096 --> 01:38:54,977
Notice of a public hearing, City of Medford.

1027
01:38:55,538 --> 01:39:06,606
Medford City Council will hold a public hearing in the Howard F. Alden Chambers at Medford City Hall, 85 George B. Hassett Drive, Medford, Massachusetts and via Zoom on Tuesday, November 18th, 2025 at 7 p.m.

1028
01:39:06,626 --> 01:39:10,789
A link to this hearing will be posted no later than Friday, November 14th, 2025.

1029
01:39:11,650 --> 01:39:16,894
Purpose of this hearing is to hear the Board of Assessors on the following items for the purpose of allocation of the FY 2026 property tax

1030
01:39:18,999 --> 01:39:22,386
One, to determine the residential factor to be used for fiscal year 2026.

1031
01:39:23,368 --> 01:39:25,532
Two, select an open space discount.

1032
01:39:26,443 --> 01:39:28,125
3.

1033
01:39:26,643 --> 01:39:28,125
Select a residential exemption.

1034
01:39:28,785 --> 01:39:28,125
4.

1035
01:39:28,985 --> 01:39:30,507
Select a small commercial exemption.

1036
01:39:31,067 --> 01:39:34,990
Call 781-393-2501 for any aids and accommodation.

1037
01:39:35,591 --> 01:39:37,132
TDD 781-393-2516.

1038
01:39:37,172 --> 01:39:41,255
The City of Medford is an EEO-AA-504 employer.

1039
01:39:41,336 --> 01:39:46,360
For additional information, contact the Office of the City Clerk at 781-393-2425.

1040
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:50,223
By order of the Medford City Council, signed, Richard Alicio, Assistant City Clerk.

1041
01:39:51,998 --> 01:39:57,363
So what all that legalese means is that we have our property tax hearing tonight.

1042
01:39:57,504 --> 01:40:02,388
We're going to be talking about the residential factor, which means setting the residential and commercial rates.

1043
01:40:03,049 --> 01:40:11,758
We're going to be talking about, I think actually open space discount is in the hearing notice, but I didn't see it in the presentation, but maybe we'll be talking about that as well.

1044
01:40:14,523 --> 01:40:17,565
Yes, we have it in there, but we don't have open space in Medford.

1045
01:40:17,585 --> 01:40:21,307
So I would just recommend to privately owned open space.

1046
01:40:21,407 --> 01:40:21,748
Got it.

1047
01:40:22,488 --> 01:40:25,450
Um, the residential exemption and small commercial exemption.

1048
01:40:25,470 --> 01:40:27,671
We have our chief assessor with us.

1049
01:40:28,532 --> 01:40:36,657
Um, if you want to, uh, introduce tonight, give your presentation and then we'll hear from members of the council before we open the public hearing.

1050
01:40:36,977 --> 01:40:37,478
Yep.

1051
01:40:37,518 --> 01:40:37,678
Great.

1052
01:40:38,661 --> 01:40:43,922
So tonight, like you just went over, we're voting, or you're voting for those.

1053
01:40:44,222 --> 01:40:46,243
Do you have a presentation to share on screen?

1054
01:40:46,663 --> 01:40:50,564
So I was going off last year's, the way we did it last year, and you had it.

1055
01:40:50,584 --> 01:40:51,064
I shared it.

1056
01:40:51,384 --> 01:40:52,104
And then you shared it.

1057
01:40:52,144 --> 01:40:52,544
I'll share it.

1058
01:40:52,684 --> 01:40:53,344
Give me one second.

1059
01:40:53,384 --> 01:40:55,265
You can do the verbal introduction while I get it up.

1060
01:40:55,445 --> 01:40:55,625
Yep.

1061
01:40:59,866 --> 01:41:04,367
So the vote that we're going to do tonight is for the

1062
01:41:06,606 --> 01:41:19,460
maximum shift to 175% residential to commercial, industrial, and personal property, a vote for the residential exemption, and then a vote for a small commercial exemption.

1063
01:41:23,644 --> 01:41:25,166
Give me one second here.

1064
01:41:46,992 --> 01:41:47,673
Sorry about that.

1065
01:41:47,693 --> 01:41:51,116
It's going to take a second.

1066
01:41:51,196 --> 01:42:02,728
All right.

1067
01:42:04,149 --> 01:42:05,670
What are we seeing on the screen here?

1068
01:42:06,311 --> 01:42:07,012
Is that the right thing?

1069
01:42:19,586 --> 01:42:20,786
Oh, this one?

1070
01:42:22,207 --> 01:42:22,387
All right.

1071
01:42:27,269 --> 01:42:27,549
Go ahead.

1072
01:42:28,269 --> 01:42:29,249
Yep, that's the correct one.

1073
01:42:30,049 --> 01:42:32,890
So we could just start at- Start at slide two, gotcha.

1074
01:42:32,910 --> 01:42:33,351
Yep, there you go.

1075
01:42:33,371 --> 01:42:36,211
All right, they're not numbered on my end, so I'm just gonna go in order.

1076
01:42:36,372 --> 01:42:36,732
Perfect.

1077
01:42:38,092 --> 01:42:39,913
Right, so that's what we just went over.

1078
01:42:39,953 --> 01:42:41,513
That's the purpose of the hearing.

1079
01:42:41,533 --> 01:42:46,615
And then three votes that will be taken tonight.

1080
01:42:48,987 --> 01:42:49,567
Next slide.

1081
01:42:51,569 --> 01:42:56,391
This is just a breakdown of the budget that was in the budget book and slightly amended.

1082
01:42:56,411 --> 01:43:03,495
It basically shows that 72.5% of the budgeted revenue comes from property tax.

1083
01:43:06,737 --> 01:43:07,398
Next slide.

1084
01:43:12,102 --> 01:43:15,405
So this just summarizes how we do our assessments every year.

1085
01:43:15,485 --> 01:43:23,511
So for fiscal year 26, we look at all of calendar year 2024 sales data, and that feeds our mass appraisal model.

1086
01:43:25,452 --> 01:43:29,754
DOR standards require us to be with an assessment to sale ratio of 90 to 110.

1087
01:43:30,095 --> 01:43:42,020
So in other words, the sales that we analyze feed the mass appraisal model, and then we send that to DOR, they give us final approval on our statistics to make sure that they meet those standards.

1088
01:43:42,700 --> 01:43:47,362
We did get that approval on October 17th of this year.

1089
01:43:48,603 --> 01:43:49,243
And next slide.

1090
01:43:51,927 --> 01:44:03,075
So this is just a summary of the DOR final certification for the sales, and that just goes through the different types of property we have.

1091
01:44:03,095 --> 01:44:03,956
They call them classes.

1092
01:44:03,996 --> 01:44:11,401
So the 101s are single families, condos are 102s, two families, 104s, three families, 105s.

1093
01:44:11,421 --> 01:44:15,764
111s and 112s are apartment buildings, and then we get into commercial and industrial, which are the 300s and 400s.

1094
01:44:15,824 --> 01:44:16,204
And next slide.

1095
01:44:23,838 --> 01:44:35,054
So this is just a year over year average between those classes that I talked about and with the property type we just put it so that public could understand it versus the class codes.

1096
01:44:36,204 --> 01:44:41,227
So as we can see with the single family, we have about a 7% change year on year.

1097
01:44:42,068 --> 01:44:43,889
Going down condos, about 5.5%.

1098
01:44:44,609 --> 01:44:46,050
Two families, 4.5.

1099
01:44:47,731 --> 01:44:48,972
Three families, roughly 7%.

1100
01:44:50,613 --> 01:44:53,815
Apartment buildings, almost 16%.

1101
01:44:54,355 --> 01:44:54,835
Commercial, 4%.

1102
01:44:55,476 --> 01:44:56,036
Industrial, 3%.

1103
01:44:56,517 --> 01:44:57,537
And personal property was 20%.

1104
01:44:57,617 --> 01:45:03,661
The two ones, the personal property came in significantly stronger.

1105
01:45:03,681 --> 01:45:04,702
There was a large,

1106
01:45:07,307 --> 01:45:14,417
a project from Eversource that drove that number, public utility, and then apartments as well.

1107
01:45:14,477 --> 01:45:19,684
We had some new growth, new construction in that apartment sector, so these numbers do include the new growth.

1108
01:45:23,972 --> 01:45:24,572
Next slide.

1109
01:45:25,512 --> 01:45:28,153
This just compares us to our neighbors.

1110
01:45:29,653 --> 01:45:39,055
Unfortunately, Everett and Somerville had not reported as of today, so we couldn't include them there, but that just shows where Medford falls in terms of their averages.

1111
01:45:40,016 --> 01:45:46,357
This data is pulled from a DOR website, and we can just see how Medford fits, again, with our neighbors.

1112
01:45:51,635 --> 01:45:54,856
And then again, going off that previous slide, these are the changes.

1113
01:45:54,937 --> 01:46:02,040
So as we went through with Medford, these are our year-on-year changes, and then it can be compared to the other cities and towns.

1114
01:46:02,820 --> 01:46:04,061
And there are year-on-year changes.

1115
01:46:09,683 --> 01:46:10,544
And then new growth.

1116
01:46:10,904 --> 01:46:15,666
So as I believe most know, new growth important to the city.

1117
01:46:16,566 --> 01:46:19,628
Proposition 2.5 allows the levy to only go up by 2.5% every year.

1118
01:46:21,265 --> 01:46:26,049
But new growth is added to that number, and that's how the final levy limit is derived.

1119
01:46:27,129 --> 01:46:33,154
So this year, new growth was certified on the same day, October 17, $280 million in assessed value, which equates to $3,534,431 in tax levy growth.

1120
01:46:45,795 --> 01:46:54,120
The residential portion of that was roughly 1.3 million, and CIP was roughly 2.2 million commercial, industrial, and personal property.

1121
01:46:57,722 --> 01:46:58,863
This just breaks it down.

1122
01:46:58,903 --> 01:47:05,147
So this is basically a similar chart for how it's reported to DOR.

1123
01:47:05,427 --> 01:47:13,232
This just gives the residential rate that applies to the residential portion of it, and then the CIP rate that applies to

1124
01:47:14,079 --> 01:47:21,105
the commercial, industrial, and personal property, and then in the far right column, it totals, and you get to that 3.534 number.

1125
01:47:24,969 --> 01:47:26,650
And next slide, please.

1126
01:47:28,412 --> 01:47:36,198
So this is just a 10-year look back for our new growth and how we've done going back to fiscal year 2015.

1127
01:47:37,099 --> 01:47:39,481
So as you can see, there's been a increase in

1128
01:47:42,417 --> 01:47:52,287
commercial and, oh, CIP and in residential, blue is in residential, CIP is in orange, blue is residential, CIP is orange.

1129
01:47:53,588 --> 01:47:57,732
And then the following chart is a little bit easier to read in terms of the trends.

1130
01:47:58,012 --> 01:48:05,900
This is the trend line, the yellow being, the green being the total, the blue being residential, and the orange being CIP.

1131
01:48:11,956 --> 01:48:13,017
And next slide, please.

1132
01:48:15,478 --> 01:48:19,081
So these are our value totals and how it breaks down in the pie chart.

1133
01:48:19,241 --> 01:48:31,629
So residential makes up a significant portion of our total valuation in the city, roughly 89%, commercial, roughly 8%, industrial, roughly 1%, and personal property, 2%.

1134
01:48:37,787 --> 01:48:39,388
And then how we calculate the tax rate.

1135
01:48:39,548 --> 01:48:51,078
So if we did not shift and we just stayed with a singular tax rate, it's a simple mathematical equation where you take the property tax levy and you divide it by the total taxable valuation in the city.

1136
01:48:51,859 --> 01:48:58,224
If we do that, we would come out to a $9.53 flat rate.

1137
01:48:59,165 --> 01:49:00,306
We don't typically do that.

1138
01:49:00,366 --> 01:49:04,289
We shift to the maximum that we can, which then gives us the lowest

1139
01:49:06,830 --> 01:49:10,574
minimum residential factor for the residential class.

1140
01:49:11,295 --> 01:49:17,241
So that would drop the residential rate to $8.63 and move the commercial rate to $16.68.

1141
01:49:17,281 --> 01:49:28,053
In other words, we're shifting a portion of the levy away from residential and to commercial industrial and personal property to the maximum allowable by law.

1142
01:49:33,304 --> 01:49:37,066
And this slide, so at the bottom, this is what we're doing this year.

1143
01:49:37,126 --> 01:49:41,068
By doing that full shift, these numbers are going back to 2017.

1144
01:49:41,348 --> 01:49:43,809
We had that shift in place to the maximum.

1145
01:49:44,570 --> 01:49:54,495
So this shifts the levy over to where CIP now picks up roughly 20% and the residentials at roughly 80%.

1146
01:50:01,726 --> 01:50:05,049
And then this is, again, what I touched on with the minimum residential factor.

1147
01:50:05,129 --> 01:50:27,406
So the one would result in a singular tax rate, and then when we shift it to the 175, which is the maximum allowable, that gives us a residential factor of .905494, and that is what we would be adopting if we chose to go with the 175% shift.

1148
01:50:34,338 --> 01:50:49,803
This here just gives us a breakdown of if we didn't go with the 1.75 shift, we could go with 1.5 or the singular, and it shows how the tax rates get adjusted and how also the residential and CIP levy move.

1149
01:50:50,283 --> 01:50:56,065
So at the bottom line, which is what we typically adopt, the 1.75, you can see that the tax rate is $8.63, 16.68 for CIP, and how it moves the distribution of the levy.

1150
01:51:04,038 --> 01:51:11,522
So the residential levy drops and the commercial levy moves up as we go up in the CIP factor.

1151
01:51:17,765 --> 01:51:29,111
So this chart here, this slide here is just the year-on-year tax bill difference, assuming we're using the averages for a single family and then the average for commercial.

1152
01:51:30,112 --> 01:51:32,533
So the tax bill

1153
01:51:33,663 --> 01:51:38,886
average for the average single family this year would be roughly $8,202, and then $19,783 if we went to a single tax rate.

1154
01:51:38,946 --> 01:51:43,489
If we stayed with the full shift at 175%, the tax bill for the average single family would be $7,427, and the commercial would be $34,626.

1155
01:52:04,134 --> 01:52:21,242
And then this is just a recap of the average single family tax bill, again, going back to fiscal year 16, and year on year from fiscal year 25, we're up roughly 4.86% on the actual tax bill.

1156
01:52:21,842 --> 01:52:31,986
The year on year change for the values is 6.92, and they don't equate because of the Prop 2 1⁄2, where it doesn't allow us to go higher than that.

1157
01:52:33,952 --> 01:52:39,817
tax rate falls, which yields a lower percent for the year-on-year change for the bill.

1158
01:52:47,504 --> 01:52:48,805
And then the residential exemption.

1159
01:52:53,029 --> 01:52:59,615
So I know we talk about this yearly, so I tried to get some good numbers to talk about this discussion here.

1160
01:53:02,251 --> 01:53:11,538
Based on the assumptions that we used this year, we came up with a break-even point of about $1 million to $1.5 million in value.

1161
01:53:12,659 --> 01:53:21,186
Assuming that those assumptions are accurate, if it was adopted at the full 35% exemption, the residential tax rate would move to $12.29 per thousand.

1162
01:53:25,638 --> 01:53:31,100
And the summary on the last bullet point is the cities and towns that do already have it.

1163
01:53:32,141 --> 01:53:36,242
10 of the 20 communities I thought of note, they are in the Cape and Islands.

1164
01:53:37,843 --> 01:53:44,305
It's mainly beneficial where it's a high rental community and it benefits year round residents.

1165
01:53:45,406 --> 01:53:48,007
So that's that bullet point there.

1166
01:53:54,354 --> 01:53:56,595
One second, we may be having a technical issue.

1167
01:55:01,170 --> 01:55:02,011
Jim, are we good?

1168
01:55:02,031 --> 01:55:10,842
All right.

1169
01:55:11,042 --> 01:55:11,182
Great.

1170
01:55:11,222 --> 01:55:12,403
All right.

1171
01:55:12,484 --> 01:55:13,044
Continue, Jared.

1172
01:55:13,144 --> 01:55:13,445
Thank you.

1173
01:55:13,505 --> 01:55:13,885
OK.

1174
01:55:14,866 --> 01:55:16,849
So really, the last two slides are just a summary.

1175
01:55:22,802 --> 01:55:24,782
of what tonight would be.

1176
01:55:24,942 --> 01:55:32,184
So this granting the small commercial exemption, which is on the agenda, my understanding is we've never done this.

1177
01:55:32,984 --> 01:55:45,206
It's an option where the intent would be the exemption is to give a tax reduction to small commercial owners, property owners, at the expense of the larger commercial and industrial parcels.

1178
01:55:46,826 --> 01:55:49,627
The exemption would have to be, it's for,

1179
01:55:51,031 --> 01:55:57,436
average annual employment of not more than 10 people during the previous calendar year, and with an assessed value of under a million dollars.

1180
01:56:00,879 --> 01:56:02,620
And then the last slide is just a summary.

1181
01:56:04,942 --> 01:56:10,266
So tonight would be a discussion of adoption for the minimum residential factor.

1182
01:56:10,286 --> 01:56:15,770
So if we went with the full shift, we would be adopting a residential factor of .905494.

1183
01:56:18,403 --> 01:56:25,268
which would yield those tax rates of 863 and 1668, and then the vote for the residential exemption.

1184
01:56:26,569 --> 01:56:31,112
And then the last one would be that vote for the small commercial exemption.

1185
01:56:33,574 --> 01:56:34,034
Thank you.

1186
01:56:34,354 --> 01:56:38,637
And Chair, the recommendations are to adopt the residential factor of .905493,

1187
01:56:41,552 --> 01:56:45,454
to not adopt a residential exemption and to not adopt the small commercial exemption?

1188
01:56:45,814 --> 01:56:46,334
That's correct.

1189
01:56:46,814 --> 01:56:47,114
Okay.

1190
01:56:48,115 --> 01:56:50,316
Is that the last slide?

1191
01:56:50,716 --> 01:56:51,416
That is the last slide.

1192
01:56:51,616 --> 01:56:51,876
All right.

1193
01:56:52,096 --> 01:56:53,397
I'll stop sharing for now.

1194
01:56:53,517 --> 01:56:55,318
We can bring that up when we come back to a vote.

1195
01:56:56,038 --> 01:57:02,621
I'm going to go to questions from members of the Council, and then we can open the public hearing.

1196
01:57:02,641 --> 01:57:04,401
Let's hear from members of the Council.

1197
01:57:04,521 --> 01:57:05,582
Councilor Lazaro.

1198
01:57:16,428 --> 01:57:30,542
Do you have an idea of what percentage of residents would need to be renting in order for a residential exemption to be logical for Medford?

1199
01:57:34,508 --> 01:57:35,229
That's a tough one.

1200
01:57:35,249 --> 01:57:38,491
So what we have to do is we have to make an assumption when we come up with those numbers.

1201
01:57:38,511 --> 01:57:39,452
So there's two inputs.

1202
01:57:39,712 --> 01:57:41,974
It's one is where would the exemption be?

1203
01:57:41,994 --> 01:57:43,655
Would it be 5, 10, 15, 20 up to 35%?

1204
01:57:43,715 --> 01:57:47,078
And then two, how many people would be eligible for it?

1205
01:57:48,099 --> 01:57:51,562
So we're assuming, I don't know, somewhere in the neighborhood of 70, 75.

1206
01:57:51,942 --> 01:57:59,648
We're not, to my knowledge, a very high rental community in terms of owner occupied properties.

1207
01:57:59,988 --> 01:58:00,149
So

1208
01:58:02,397 --> 01:58:06,699
I would assume that a lot of people would in the single family class get it.

1209
01:58:07,080 --> 01:58:11,362
Now, can you repeat what was the data you were looking for?

1210
01:58:12,663 --> 01:58:22,348
I'm curious what percentage of our population would need to be renters for it to make sense for us to utilize residential exemption.

1211
01:58:24,267 --> 01:58:29,631
We have something like, Medford has something like 40, 45% renters, isn't it?

1212
01:58:29,731 --> 01:58:31,252
I can't remember.

1213
01:58:31,272 --> 01:58:31,252
47?

1214
01:58:32,373 --> 01:58:35,976
47% maybe renters.

1215
01:58:37,197 --> 01:58:39,058
It's not a small percentage.

1216
01:58:39,359 --> 01:58:48,065
And I believe last year, and I think also the year before that, we asked about looking into this more carefully.

1217
01:58:48,085 --> 01:58:51,808
We don't have to do it right now, but we should do it at some point.

1218
01:58:54,008 --> 01:59:10,554
figure out what it would take to, when it's logical to do it, because some of those cities and towns that were mentioned are not in the CAPE.

1219
01:59:11,034 --> 01:59:16,096
And Medford is a city that has a lot of income disparity.

1220
01:59:16,776 --> 01:59:21,498
And I think it's worth looking at and doing a study that would explain

1221
01:59:23,387 --> 01:59:26,570
who would benefit from an exemption and who wouldn't.

1222
01:59:27,050 --> 01:59:37,578
But also I know that residential exemptions sometimes really just benefit people that have means and don't need a tax break.

1223
01:59:38,139 --> 01:59:40,841
So people like me, I own my property.

1224
01:59:40,941 --> 01:59:42,122
I don't need a tax break.

1225
01:59:43,043 --> 01:59:52,410
I still wanna be able to contribute to my community to the full extent, but all of that stuff, I think it would be nice to have it laid out so we could present it to the community because we do get a lot of questions about that.

1226
01:59:53,758 --> 01:59:59,840
And it feels like we keep asking during this meeting every year, and then we still don't have the data.

1227
02:00:00,301 --> 02:00:01,681
So it's not your fault.

1228
02:00:02,041 --> 02:00:02,821
No, it's fine.

1229
02:00:03,002 --> 02:00:08,744
So I can't give you the number of renters, and we don't run a census, but we track parcels.

1230
02:00:09,544 --> 02:00:14,786
So what I did do is I can give you the number of rental units we have in the city.

1231
02:00:15,446 --> 02:00:17,707
So for all the apartment buildings and

1232
02:00:19,315 --> 02:00:26,601
we call the class 111 and 112, there's 3,721 units in those buildings collectively in the entire city.

1233
02:00:27,341 --> 02:00:30,844
And if you add in the twos and three families, we have 4,300 units there.

1234
02:00:31,945 --> 02:00:32,465
Oh, okay.

1235
02:00:32,846 --> 02:00:39,010
So we track that data, we just don't track the actual renters, like physical people, we don't do a census.

1236
02:00:39,611 --> 02:00:43,334
No, I think that's fine, that's useful, because that would be what would be taxed, right?

1237
02:00:43,414 --> 02:00:44,555
Just to clarify, there's 8,000 units

1238
02:00:46,604 --> 02:00:49,646
either in large apartments or two and three family buildings?

1239
02:00:50,667 --> 02:00:53,629
Collectively, yeah, roughly.

1240
02:00:53,649 --> 02:00:58,192
So there's 3,721 in the four to eight and then nine plus collectively.

1241
02:00:58,592 --> 02:01:00,093
And then in the twos and three families, 4,300.

1242
02:01:00,593 --> 02:01:02,875
And then there's how many single families?

1243
02:01:02,895 --> 02:01:02,875
7,855.

1244
02:01:02,915 --> 02:01:04,195
So it's about 50-50.

1245
02:01:04,215 --> 02:01:04,275
Yes.

1246
02:01:13,254 --> 02:01:21,296
It would be, I just think it would be nice to have it laid out at some point in the future when we're not in one of these meetings with a lot of things on the agenda.

1247
02:01:22,897 --> 02:01:40,301
Maybe to talk about in committee, like what would be, what would make logical sense if it ever makes sense for us to go through and figure out how a residential exemption would benefit our residents, who it would benefit, how much it would benefit them.

1248
02:01:40,967 --> 02:01:46,231
and be able to answer residents when they ask us about it is my primary concern.

1249
02:01:47,592 --> 02:01:47,872
Thank you.

1250
02:01:48,752 --> 02:01:49,413
Thank you, Councilor Zahra.

1251
02:01:49,433 --> 02:01:52,575
Yeah, I think it's kind of a deja vu all over again moment, right?

1252
02:01:52,615 --> 02:02:01,061
Every time we do this, you know, there's a lot of reasons why and why not other communities have adopted residential exemptions in the past.

1253
02:02:01,941 --> 02:02:06,705
I think the way to explain the policy in general

1254
02:02:07,796 --> 02:02:08,597
is pretty simple.

1255
02:02:09,098 --> 02:02:10,360
You calculated a break even of $1,038,000.

1256
02:02:10,400 --> 02:02:13,063
So if you live, if you're the owner of a residential property,

1257
02:02:18,438 --> 02:02:30,345
and you live at that property, and it's your primary residence, and your house is worth more than $1,038,727, you would pay more in taxes.

1258
02:02:31,105 --> 02:02:38,009
And if you are the same person living in a property, a residential house, it's your primary residence, you're the owner-occupant,

1259
02:02:38,702 --> 02:02:43,245
and it's valued less than $1,038,727, you would pay less.

1260
02:02:44,126 --> 02:02:45,286
That's correct.

1261
02:02:45,386 --> 02:02:50,230
And as you get farther away from that break point, either way, it becomes more significant.

1262
02:02:50,250 --> 02:02:51,250
It's an asymptote.

1263
02:02:51,771 --> 02:02:53,612
Yes, exactly.

1264
02:02:54,292 --> 02:02:55,773
And then the other can't see that.

1265
02:02:55,953 --> 02:02:56,954
Camera's too far from me.

1266
02:02:57,014 --> 02:03:04,539
But basically, if your residential property is very lower than the values, $300,000 assessed value, $400,000 assessed value, you're paying a lot less.

1267
02:03:07,774 --> 02:03:12,316
And if your residential property is 30 million, if it's a big apartment building, you're paying quite a bit more.

1268
02:03:12,336 --> 02:03:14,457
Yeah, it would significantly hurt the apartment buildings.

1269
02:03:14,497 --> 02:03:20,959
And I know we talk about how would it trickle down to rents or would it be a supply issue where they incentivize this more condo conversion?

1270
02:03:22,019 --> 02:03:24,961
It's all theories who would have to see how it plays out to know.

1271
02:03:25,681 --> 02:03:33,724
But it essentially turns our flat rate that you pay, whether you're a small condo owner or a large apartment building owner company,

1272
02:03:34,733 --> 02:03:37,817
into a graduated rate, a progressive rate.

1273
02:03:37,937 --> 02:03:46,989
So if your property's worth a lot more, you pay more, and if your property's worth less, you pay less, and that breaks even at about a million dollars of property value.

1274
02:03:47,774 --> 02:03:49,155
Yes, and it's pretty accurate.

1275
02:03:49,175 --> 02:03:53,919
So if we did, there would be roughly $300,000 in exempted value.

1276
02:03:54,059 --> 02:03:55,861
That would come off across the board.

1277
02:03:55,881 --> 02:03:57,642
And it can't be less than 10%.

1278
02:03:57,723 --> 02:04:01,025
The bill can't be less than 10% of what it otherwise would be.

1279
02:04:01,085 --> 02:04:06,030
So if a condo was $300,000 and they couldn't take the full $300,000, it would be capped.

1280
02:04:06,070 --> 02:04:09,533
It would have to be at least 10% of the bill otherwise.

1281
02:04:10,393 --> 02:04:11,893
Right, so nobody's getting a zero.

1282
02:04:12,173 --> 02:04:14,294
Well, it can't go down to zero exactly, 10%.

1283
02:04:15,114 --> 02:04:25,196
And then on the other side, if you're at $2 million and you only get the $300 off, you're going to still pay more because the tax rate is at $1,229 in this scenario versus the $863.

1284
02:04:26,136 --> 02:04:26,356
Right.

1285
02:04:27,356 --> 02:04:28,597
Essentially, everybody's getting $300.

1286
02:04:28,657 --> 02:04:35,118
If you're an owner-occupant, you're getting $300,000 off of your assessed value for your tax bill.

1287
02:04:36,172 --> 02:04:40,974
whether you're, except if your value's that low.

1288
02:04:41,114 --> 02:04:42,574
If you're at $500,000, you're getting $300,000 off.

1289
02:04:43,354 --> 02:04:46,475
If you're at $30 million, you're getting $300,000 off, essentially.

1290
02:04:46,695 --> 02:04:47,075
Exactly.

1291
02:04:47,295 --> 02:04:51,397
But because of that, the tax rate is higher for everybody.

1292
02:04:53,737 --> 02:04:54,838
And that's basically how that works.

1293
02:04:54,858 --> 02:04:56,518
That's how it pays for itself.

1294
02:04:57,339 --> 02:04:58,319
Right, because it has to be.

1295
02:04:58,359 --> 02:04:59,439
The levy does not change.

1296
02:04:59,479 --> 02:05:00,460
We don't reduce the levy.

1297
02:05:00,500 --> 02:05:04,861
It just shifts roughly $4 billion somewhere else in value.

1298
02:05:05,995 --> 02:05:07,817
$4 billion in value?

1299
02:05:07,837 --> 02:05:12,160
3.5 to 4.5, depending on how many are eligible and how much we receive.

1300
02:05:12,240 --> 02:05:13,301
It would be that much in value.

1301
02:05:13,321 --> 02:05:14,782
All right.

1302
02:05:14,802 --> 02:05:16,003
I'm going to go to Councilor Kelley.

1303
02:05:17,524 --> 02:05:18,985
Just a quick point of information.

1304
02:05:19,265 --> 02:05:26,591
You have been explaining it, only talking about people who live on the property.

1305
02:05:26,851 --> 02:05:30,594
But there are properties that are owned by people who don't live on the property.

1306
02:05:30,634 --> 02:05:34,317
And those properties that are purely landlord properties

1307
02:05:35,501 --> 02:05:36,561
they would not get the discount.

1308
02:05:37,782 --> 02:05:39,363
Right, they need to own and occupy.

1309
02:05:39,523 --> 02:05:42,604
Yeah, I think it's important for the public to understand.

1310
02:05:42,624 --> 02:05:45,725
We can't just explain it in terms of people who live on the property.

1311
02:05:46,146 --> 02:05:54,869
We have to also include the part that if you're purely a landlord and you don't live in Medford and you live in some other city or some other country, then you don't get the discount.

1312
02:05:54,970 --> 02:05:55,450
Absolutely.

1313
02:05:55,490 --> 02:05:56,810
So it gives a discount.

1314
02:05:56,990 --> 02:05:59,131
Andy, Andy, Andy.

1315
02:06:01,188 --> 02:06:02,289
Right, yeah, that's what I was saying.

1316
02:06:02,569 --> 02:06:11,013
If you own the property and you live in that property and it's your primary residence, you can get, essentially, your assessed value comes down $300,000.

1317
02:06:12,333 --> 02:06:21,238
But in order to pay for that, the rate, right, the rate this year would be 8.6, if we adopt the split, and it would be 12.2 if we had the exemption.

1318
02:06:22,178 --> 02:06:29,882
So if you're not owning, if you're not an owner-occupant, if you're a landlord or an owner, you know, someone owns a residential property and doesn't live in it,

1319
02:06:30,705 --> 02:06:32,269
then they wouldn't get that discount.

1320
02:06:32,550 --> 02:06:35,156
They would not get the discount and the tax rate would move up $3.66 in this scenario.

1321
02:06:40,212 --> 02:06:41,374
I just wanted that to be clear.

1322
02:06:41,914 --> 02:06:43,216
And then a couple of questions.

1323
02:06:44,077 --> 02:06:46,239
I also feel like a little bit of deja vu.

1324
02:06:46,699 --> 02:06:56,610
I know last year I was surprised to find out that we were not able to vote in favor of a residential exemption at this meeting where it's literally on the agenda.

1325
02:06:56,971 --> 02:07:00,214
I will continue to make the case that

1326
02:07:02,476 --> 02:07:04,558
I have two questions, essentially.

1327
02:07:04,678 --> 02:07:09,281
My first is related to this residential exemption, and I know I asked this last year.

1328
02:07:09,301 --> 02:07:10,862
I'm going to ask it again.

1329
02:07:11,962 --> 02:07:14,064
How could we be in a position

1330
02:07:15,249 --> 02:07:18,652
when this comes on our agenda to be able to actually make a vote?

1331
02:07:19,312 --> 02:07:20,733
What is the process by which we do that?

1332
02:07:20,753 --> 02:07:37,767
And if I may, let me tell you my other question before we get, sorry, sidetracked, which is I'm curious about the small commercial exemption because my understanding, tell me if I'm wrong, is that the exemption is given to the owner of the property, but it is given only

1333
02:07:38,247 --> 02:07:43,291
to it if it is occupied by a business, a certain type of business with less than 10 employees.

1334
02:07:43,691 --> 02:07:50,997
And there's no guarantee that the owner of the property is gonna give any kind of discount to that person who is the business that's got the less than 10 employees.

1335
02:07:51,037 --> 02:07:55,260
Right, the tenants typically don't get the benefit of it, right?

1336
02:07:55,300 --> 02:08:00,384
So it's typically not, I believe, since I've been here, that's why we've never adopted it.

1337
02:08:00,744 --> 02:08:01,425
That makes me sad.

1338
02:08:01,605 --> 02:08:03,967
Okay, but if you could answer my first question, that would be great.

1339
02:08:04,575 --> 02:08:08,897
Yep, so it's about implementation, right, is how we get there.

1340
02:08:08,957 --> 02:08:13,159
So assume we get 10,000 applications.

1341
02:08:14,560 --> 02:08:17,382
That's probably in the ballpark of what we would get.

1342
02:08:18,242 --> 02:08:25,546
If we could process six per hour, that's 10 per minute, that would be 210 on a 35-hour week.

1343
02:08:25,866 --> 02:08:28,627
It would take 47 weeks to get through the 10,000 applications.

1344
02:08:29,948 --> 02:08:31,749
Now, we need to know that before October,

1345
02:08:32,165 --> 02:08:33,926
because we need to factor it into the tax rate.

1346
02:08:33,946 --> 02:08:40,450
If we don't do that correctly, it will be a significant impact to the overlay, and it can cause problems for the finance department.

1347
02:08:41,371 --> 02:08:44,573
And I don't want Bob to be yelling at me.

1348
02:08:44,713 --> 02:08:53,499
So what we'd have to do is have it done, I think, even before the fiscal year started.

1349
02:08:53,959 --> 02:08:59,883
I'd say we'd need somehow to do it 10 months ahead of when we need it done based on the math.

1350
02:09:01,863 --> 02:09:06,305
And can I follow up?

1351
02:09:06,325 --> 02:09:13,728
So that would mean, essentially, assume there would have to be some sort of extra funding in order to hire more people.

1352
02:09:13,748 --> 02:09:15,869
You wouldn't be able to do it with your current staff?

1353
02:09:15,889 --> 02:09:16,529
I mean, that's a lot.

1354
02:09:16,569 --> 02:09:18,690
It's like 47 weeks of work.

1355
02:09:18,930 --> 02:09:20,591
I assume that your current staff would not be able to do that?

1356
02:09:20,951 --> 02:09:23,412
I don't see a way we could do it with the staff we have now.

1357
02:09:24,022 --> 02:09:25,083
So it require funding.

1358
02:09:25,103 --> 02:09:29,447
The city council cannot vote to fund anything.

1359
02:09:29,467 --> 02:09:41,558
We requested this funding the last two budget cycles to request that the mayor put in the annual budget the funding to hire two people in the assessor's office to make this possible.

1360
02:09:41,598 --> 02:09:43,200
We requested that for, I believe, the last two.

1361
02:09:45,078 --> 02:09:46,499
We're in fiscal 26, right?

1362
02:09:46,900 --> 02:09:48,941
It was in our budget recommendations for fiscal 26.

1363
02:09:49,102 --> 02:09:58,049
I think they were in our budget recommendations for fiscal 25 as well to request that staff support to make it possible for us to take this vote.

1364
02:09:58,569 --> 02:10:01,092
So just want to be crystal clear.

1365
02:10:01,132 --> 02:10:06,096
The city council cannot actually vote on this thing that is supposedly the city council's purview.

1366
02:10:06,136 --> 02:10:07,877
And that's not really, it's not so much a question.

1367
02:10:07,917 --> 02:10:08,498
Yeah, exactly.

1368
02:10:08,698 --> 02:10:11,400
And I did last year too.

1369
02:10:11,500 --> 02:10:13,482
I was that person who voted for it last year.

1370
02:10:14,022 --> 02:10:23,206
And I may vote for it again because, you know, it is a thing that I think we should be doing, is at a minimum, getting the funding.

1371
02:10:23,866 --> 02:10:29,509
Like, I love the idea of putting it in committee so that we can have a more thorough discussion and research.

1372
02:10:31,109 --> 02:10:35,031
And I believe, I would like to make a

1373
02:10:35,924 --> 02:10:52,978
motion that we put this in one of the committees with the goal of having those meetings before March so that we can do it in the time necessary.

1374
02:10:52,998 --> 02:11:00,423
That would be a B paper to request a meeting of the administration finance committee.

1375
02:11:00,744 --> 02:11:01,084
Perfect.

1376
02:11:04,182 --> 02:11:04,402
Okay.

1377
02:11:04,903 --> 02:11:06,324
Is that okay?

1378
02:11:06,384 --> 02:11:06,845
Yes, 100%.

1379
02:11:07,045 --> 02:11:07,385
Thank you.

1380
02:11:07,525 --> 02:11:18,476
Many of the whole to discuss funding for the assessor's office to be able to implement a residential exemption?

1381
02:11:23,121 --> 02:11:23,961
Before March?

1382
02:11:24,882 --> 02:11:27,525
Yeah, I would say really in January, February.

1383
02:11:29,523 --> 02:11:29,903
Right?

1384
02:11:29,963 --> 02:11:30,804
That's great.

1385
02:11:30,824 --> 02:11:31,304
Before March.

1386
02:11:31,364 --> 02:11:31,644
Perfect.

1387
02:11:31,664 --> 02:11:31,804
Yes.

1388
02:11:31,904 --> 02:11:37,108
I want to be clear that shouting out in the chambers generally is not a way to edit a motion.

1389
02:11:37,769 --> 02:11:38,409
Alright.

1390
02:11:41,572 --> 02:11:42,352
Anything further?

1391
02:11:42,412 --> 02:11:43,133
Councilor Callahan.

1392
02:11:45,595 --> 02:11:46,495
Alright.

1393
02:11:46,735 --> 02:11:48,056
Councilor Scarpelli.

1394
02:11:48,076 --> 02:11:49,177
Thank you, Mr. President.

1395
02:11:49,217 --> 02:11:50,078
Thanks for my colleagues.

1396
02:11:50,358 --> 02:11:57,003
Great questions and God, I want to thank you because I know we spent a lot of time and understanding and council

1397
02:11:58,813 --> 02:12:10,541
point, sitting in that meeting, I think it's important that even sitting down, and I know when we talked and we look at real numbers and real people, you really get to understand that it's just not in totality.

1398
02:12:10,901 --> 02:12:17,625
Because I would look at myself and say, sure, I'd like to be, like, my fellow counselor and support if I can, because I might have means other than others.

1399
02:12:17,705 --> 02:12:22,809
But when you look at approving something like that, we could see how it could hurt the

1400
02:12:23,967 --> 02:12:39,452
senior citizen that lives in a home of 1.5 because the increase is, you know, the house is valued at that but live in a fixed income and understand the implications and the gaps that then occur and who has to pick up that gap.

1401
02:12:39,732 --> 02:12:41,113
And that's what's pretty scary to me.

1402
02:12:41,673 --> 02:12:44,974
It's no different than understanding the rental process as well.

1403
02:12:45,815 --> 02:12:51,116
Increasing taxes to a landlord isn't really gonna affect that person.

1404
02:12:51,476 --> 02:12:52,797
What that person's gonna do is what?

1405
02:12:53,326 --> 02:13:00,108
They're going to trickle down and look at their 10, um, 10 renters and say, fine with me, do whatever you want.

1406
02:13:00,428 --> 02:13:01,469
It's an extra a hundred dollars.

1407
02:13:01,989 --> 02:13:04,970
So, um, again, I think that that's why it's important.

1408
02:13:04,990 --> 02:13:09,251
I think to have this meeting and, and, and look at truly how it affects real people.

1409
02:13:09,751 --> 02:13:12,572
And, um, you know, because it does, it, it, it,

1410
02:13:13,165 --> 02:13:22,896
When you look at it in totality, you realize that it's something that we need, something that we've always said that we wanted to visit and understand it.

1411
02:13:22,956 --> 02:13:32,847
Because my other question or my other response was what we've talked about for many years is the lack of support you have.

1412
02:13:33,357 --> 02:13:37,999
in your office to even look at this right now and then making sure that we fund it correctly.

1413
02:13:38,059 --> 02:13:49,823
So there's many, many different variables that I know it sounds great because when I get phone calls every year, same people, Hey, George, you're going to vote for the residential exemption because I, I need it to tax the override went off everything.

1414
02:13:50,003 --> 02:13:50,543
I'm getting killed.

1415
02:13:50,583 --> 02:13:58,906
I need, you know, I want to, I want, I want, I want to go down from 7,000 back down to 4,000 sounds great, but somebody else has to fit that bill.

1416
02:13:59,603 --> 02:14:06,286
So I think that that's why I support my colleagues and the decisions and the requests that they've asked tonight.

1417
02:14:06,326 --> 02:14:21,711
But I will, I know we need to move forward with this and I'm going to support the classification, the vote and summary if I can, that I would move to select the minimum residential like we've asked the factor of 9.905493.

1418
02:14:21,751 --> 02:14:21,831
And

1419
02:14:27,067 --> 02:14:37,451
Unfortunately, we need to move forward to vote no on the residential exemption and vote no on the small commercial exemption because there are no guarantees that that would fall back on the business owner.

1420
02:14:37,951 --> 02:14:43,153
It would just fall back on the, make a difference.

1421
02:14:43,193 --> 02:14:48,835
So in my eyes, those are my three motions that I would move forward and to a vote.

1422
02:14:48,935 --> 02:14:49,735
Thank you, Mr. President.

1423
02:14:50,888 --> 02:14:52,229
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1424
02:14:52,849 --> 02:14:57,812
We'll take a vote on those three, but I actually, I have to open the public hearing first after questions from councilors.

1425
02:14:58,492 --> 02:15:01,394
Are there any further questions from councilors for the chief assessor?

1426
02:15:04,436 --> 02:15:14,622
Seeing none, I will open the public hearing on the assessment for the fiscal 26 tax levy classification.

1427
02:15:15,642 --> 02:15:16,303
So is there,

1428
02:15:17,727 --> 02:15:18,789
You've issued your recommendation.

1429
02:15:18,829 --> 02:15:23,916
Is there anyone who'd like to speak on the tax levy classification this evening?

1430
02:15:25,018 --> 02:15:28,744
Either in person or on Zoom, if you're in the chamber, please approach the podium.

1431
02:15:29,124 --> 02:15:31,588
If you are on Zoom, please raise your hand on Zoom.

1432
02:15:38,218 --> 02:15:40,040
Jennifer Yanko, 16 Monument Street.

1433
02:15:40,100 --> 02:15:41,020
I just have a question.

1434
02:15:42,462 --> 02:15:47,526
What are some of the municipalities that aren't in the Cape and Islands that have residential exemptions?

1435
02:15:47,566 --> 02:15:48,527
Do you have that information?

1436
02:15:48,967 --> 02:15:52,650
We don't have it.

1437
02:15:52,710 --> 02:15:53,831
Somerville and Malden.

1438
02:15:55,112 --> 02:15:55,973
I just had it here.

1439
02:15:56,033 --> 02:15:56,633
There's a list.

1440
02:15:57,434 --> 02:15:58,415
Yeah, Councillor Callahan.

1441
02:15:59,823 --> 02:16:09,306
So it is Boston, Brookline, Cambridge, Chelsea, Concord, Everett, Malden, Somerville, Waltham, Watertown.

1442
02:16:11,227 --> 02:16:11,887
That's quite a few.

1443
02:16:12,107 --> 02:16:12,687
Thank you very much.

1444
02:16:18,109 --> 02:16:19,409
Thank you for your comment.

1445
02:16:19,589 --> 02:16:24,591
Is there any further public comment either in person or on Zoom in this public hearing?

1446
02:16:27,427 --> 02:16:29,028
We'll go to the podium, name and address for the record.

1447
02:16:29,048 --> 02:16:29,788
You have three minutes.

1448
02:16:31,189 --> 02:16:39,033
Thank you, Councilor Beres, Andrew Castanetti, Cushman Street, East Medford Mass.

1449
02:16:40,054 --> 02:16:51,520
First of all, I want to say, I want to start off by saying it's been a pleasure to deal with our new Chief Real Estate Tax Assessor, Mr. Jarvis Jagdjan.

1450
02:16:54,002 --> 02:16:56,403
He's one of the better ones we've had in the last,

1451
02:16:57,186 --> 02:16:57,566
20 years.

1452
02:17:00,347 --> 02:17:07,150
I got to say something about the breakeven point because it was mentioned, and I did the mathematics and I found an error.

1453
02:17:08,710 --> 02:17:11,531
The breakeven point is not 1,038,000.

1454
02:17:11,811 --> 02:17:13,252
It's more like 1,080,000, give or take 1% or 2%.

1455
02:17:13,332 --> 02:17:15,192
And I realized in the packet, it does say

1456
02:17:26,183 --> 02:17:29,325
to 1,000,038 is a ballpark.

1457
02:17:29,846 --> 02:17:34,168
But I did the actual number, it's closer to 1,000,080, almost 1,100,000.

1458
02:17:34,888 --> 02:17:42,793
Therefore, the correct break-even is over 1,080,000.

1459
02:17:43,433 --> 02:17:54,960
And by the way, this break-even goes higher and higher every year as it should with the appreciation or inflation, whatever you wanna call it.

1460
02:17:58,921 --> 02:17:59,962
I heard deja vu.

1461
02:18:01,423 --> 02:18:03,804
Thank you for your time, but please listen.

1462
02:18:06,126 --> 02:18:08,808
It's like deja vu all over again.

1463
02:18:08,828 --> 02:18:22,238
I'm here to adopt Mass General Law Chapter 59, Section 5C, the owner-occupied real estate tax exemption at the full, full 35% shift.

1464
02:18:23,900 --> 02:18:26,341
allowed by our commonwealth of Massachusetts.

1465
02:18:27,762 --> 02:18:39,789
This is my 22nd year here in person trying to help our own occupied homeowners get a tax breaks on our real estate tax bills.

1466
02:18:40,290 --> 02:18:43,932
After all, we carried the load financially for over 100 years.

1467
02:18:46,593 --> 02:18:52,897
These cities are doing this for many years, and they're still helping their own occupied

1468
02:18:53,553 --> 02:19:04,219
real estate taxpayers in Boston, Somerville, Cambridge, Chelsea, Everett, Malden, but still not here in Medford.

1469
02:19:04,880 --> 02:19:05,340
Why not?

1470
02:19:06,921 --> 02:19:16,787
For God's sakes, even Senator Kerry gets it at 28 Lewisburg Square in Beacon Hill, if that's his real address, according to the IRS.

1471
02:19:19,271 --> 02:19:38,036
And yes, I am totally baffled why I am the only one out of 60,000 Method people who come here to fight and cares for 22 years to give thousands of owner-occupied real estate taxpayers real tax relief.

1472
02:19:41,236 --> 02:19:47,858
By the way, Dr. Stirella said to me, but Andrew, if we get it, then how is the city gonna pay their bills?

1473
02:19:50,712 --> 02:19:55,094
And my reply was, and still is, as far as I know, the law has not changed.

1474
02:19:56,155 --> 02:20:10,362
The city still gets all their money because our owner-occupied savings is simply shifted and added to all the absentee homeowners, the business investors.

1475
02:20:12,523 --> 02:20:19,127
Finally, I do believe you city councilors and many others, if you're using common sense,

1476
02:20:20,382 --> 02:20:33,366
Now realize that most of our homes are being snatched up by national and international investors, which hurts our affordability big time.

1477
02:20:35,567 --> 02:20:44,650
So let's have the absentee business new owners, maybe some are slumlords, I don't know.

1478
02:20:45,722 --> 02:20:52,745
have them pick up the tab and give us, the owner-occupied homeowners, some real estate tax relief for the first time ever.

1479
02:20:53,605 --> 02:20:54,125
Period.

1480
02:20:54,305 --> 02:20:54,785
Period.

1481
02:20:55,486 --> 02:21:02,148
But it can only be done if we adopt Mass General Law, Chapter 59, Section 5C, in my opinion.

1482
02:21:02,728 --> 02:21:04,089
Do you have a better solution?

1483
02:21:04,529 --> 02:21:05,469
What say you?

1484
02:21:06,730 --> 02:21:07,410
Thank you, Andy.

1485
02:21:08,030 --> 02:21:08,630
What say you?

1486
02:21:08,730 --> 02:21:10,051
Do you have a better idea to help

1487
02:21:10,727 --> 02:21:12,788
the people who carried this law for a hundred years.

1488
02:21:13,368 --> 02:21:14,148
Andy, thank you.

1489
02:21:14,388 --> 02:21:16,368
I think we talked about it tonight.

1490
02:21:16,729 --> 02:21:24,531
We are very interested in implementing this, but the appropriation has not been made to provide the staffing and the assessing office to make it possible.

1491
02:21:24,571 --> 02:21:24,871
Yeah, yeah.

1492
02:21:24,891 --> 02:21:25,211
I heard you.

1493
02:21:25,371 --> 02:21:27,451
I heard you cry about the mayor didn't give you the money.

1494
02:21:27,711 --> 02:21:33,133
As you said, you last November, you said you could get some money and study this six months in advance.

1495
02:21:33,573 --> 02:21:35,914
Well, anyways, why can't you vote to do this?

1496
02:21:36,734 --> 02:21:37,074
And then

1497
02:21:39,100 --> 02:21:44,865
get it done by next November, and that gives you a whole year instead of 10 months to get the job done.

1498
02:21:46,746 --> 02:21:54,432
From what I heard from what the assessor says is essentially this, I mean, we're voting on this for the January bills, right, Jared?

1499
02:21:55,473 --> 02:21:58,435
So that we would have, you would have four weeks to do 47 weeks of work.

1500
02:22:04,835 --> 02:22:10,999
No, I'm not talking about starting at a medium, I'm talking about a year from today, Mr. Assessor.

1501
02:22:13,521 --> 02:22:15,002
Yeah, no, I mean, I hear you.

1502
02:22:15,122 --> 02:22:17,304
I think what we've heard from the assessor is very clear.

1503
02:22:17,344 --> 02:22:22,107
If the mayor provides the money to the office, they can do the preparation work for us to vote on it.

1504
02:22:22,187 --> 02:22:27,911
But if the mayor doesn't provide the money to make this possible, then the assessing office doesn't have the staff to implement this program.

1505
02:22:28,477 --> 02:22:39,263
And of course, these cities, like Somerville, probably have eight people working in the assessors department, and Everett and all the other ones, especially Boston.

1506
02:22:40,624 --> 02:22:46,247
But if they're doing it and they haven't dropped out of this, that says volumes to me.

1507
02:22:46,647 --> 02:22:48,648
It must be dynamite.

1508
02:22:49,169 --> 02:22:49,609
It helps.

1509
02:22:49,989 --> 02:22:53,551
I've definitely heard from other communities that this is good in their communities.

1510
02:22:54,592 --> 02:22:56,933
I really kind of understand the mentality

1511
02:22:59,082 --> 02:23:01,483
of this council and the mayor.

1512
02:23:01,903 --> 02:23:02,623
Thank you, Andy.

1513
02:23:02,683 --> 02:23:14,206
Because if you vote majority to do it and the mayor says, okay, it automatically goes to the state house and right away we get it.

1514
02:23:15,226 --> 02:23:15,706
Thank you, Andy.

1515
02:23:15,766 --> 02:23:18,207
I'm going to go to Robert Carney on Zoom.

1516
02:23:18,287 --> 02:23:20,288
Name and address for the record, please.

1517
02:23:20,308 --> 02:23:21,148
You have three minutes.

1518
02:23:23,349 --> 02:23:24,949
Oh, here you go.

1519
02:23:27,317 --> 02:23:28,259
OK, I think I got it now.

1520
02:23:28,400 --> 02:23:28,941
Thanks.

1521
02:23:29,001 --> 02:23:29,702
Thanks for the time.

1522
02:23:30,364 --> 02:23:32,088
Robert Kearney, 50 Hicks Ave, Unit 6.

1523
02:23:32,976 --> 02:23:38,637
So I actually used to live in Everett, so I can speak to my experience.

1524
02:23:39,137 --> 02:23:43,778
Bought my first home at the age of 31, small one-bedroom condo there.

1525
02:23:43,858 --> 02:23:51,640
And what I liked, so I don't have an opinion either way on this resolution or this topic at this time.

1526
02:23:52,200 --> 02:23:59,021
But what I will say is I felt like, as a first-time home buyer, that resolution made home ownership more affordable to me.

1527
02:23:59,601 --> 02:24:02,302
And what I, bring down the property tax,

1528
02:24:02,942 --> 02:24:09,284
and then reducing my effective monthly payment, which goes into, you know, how much of a mortgage you can qualify for.

1529
02:24:10,624 --> 02:24:16,125
And I think encouraging home ownership in the city of Medford is a great thing.

1530
02:24:17,585 --> 02:24:23,827
You know, it brings more stability, you know, to people in their lives, you know, as opposed to having to worry about

1531
02:24:24,247 --> 02:24:26,028
You know, is my rent going to go up next year?

1532
02:24:26,088 --> 02:24:27,169
Is my landlord going to sell?

1533
02:24:27,189 --> 02:24:28,610
I'm going to have a new landlord, et cetera.

1534
02:24:29,050 --> 02:24:30,691
So that's just one thing I like about it.

1535
02:24:30,711 --> 02:24:37,975
So I just want to share that perspective because I am now a landlord of that same property.

1536
02:24:38,055 --> 02:24:41,117
So I'm not paying the residential exemption anymore.

1537
02:24:41,217 --> 02:24:43,298
So my property taxes are higher.

1538
02:24:43,478 --> 02:24:45,659
I feel like it's fair, just a personal opinion.

1539
02:24:46,039 --> 02:24:47,540
And I'm just glad you all are talking about it.

1540
02:24:47,620 --> 02:24:48,761
So thanks for bringing this up.

1541
02:24:49,041 --> 02:24:49,401
Thank you.

1542
02:24:51,382 --> 02:24:52,243
Thank you for your comment.

1543
02:24:53,947 --> 02:24:59,888
Is there anyone else who'd like to speak on this paper in the public hearing on the tax classification either in-person or on Zoom?

1544
02:25:04,269 --> 02:25:06,969
Seeing none, I'm gonna declare the public hearing closed.

1545
02:25:08,189 --> 02:25:10,230
All right, we have a few items here.

1546
02:25:10,270 --> 02:25:23,692
We have a B paper from Councilor Callahan to hold a committee of the whole meeting with the city administration for funding for the assessing department to implement a residential exemption in January or February.

1547
02:25:24,828 --> 02:25:25,629
Councilor Callahan.

1548
02:25:27,490 --> 02:25:34,917
I just wanna make sure that we have to do enough research and discussion as well, right?

1549
02:25:34,937 --> 02:25:38,341
Just if you can include those words, that would be great.

1550
02:25:38,681 --> 02:25:46,088
Right, committee of the whole to, I guess, what are you asking from the city administration to have prepared for that meeting?

1551
02:25:49,275 --> 02:26:01,504
Well, my motion is to make sure we have that meeting, but also if the assessor can be there, and we probably should provide whatever requests we have.

1552
02:26:01,544 --> 02:26:14,012
I know Councilor Lazaro was suggesting that there was information that she wanted, and any councilors who want information before that meeting should send that to the assessor, and the assessor hopefully can provide us with whatever information we need.

1553
02:26:16,254 --> 02:26:16,514
Got it.

1554
02:26:21,126 --> 02:26:22,287
Do you have that Mr. Clerk?

1555
02:26:26,751 --> 02:26:27,371
Sure.

1556
02:26:29,433 --> 02:26:31,054
I mean, I got the gist of what you're saying.

1557
02:26:31,294 --> 02:26:31,494
Thank you.

1558
02:26:32,055 --> 02:26:32,315
All right.

1559
02:26:32,875 --> 02:26:35,578
It's like, all right.

1560
02:26:35,738 --> 02:26:41,042
Committee of the whole research discussion about funding for the assessing department to implement a residential exemption.

1561
02:26:43,344 --> 02:26:43,624
Great.

1562
02:26:46,026 --> 02:26:48,368
By Councilor Callahan, this is a B paper seconded by.

1563
02:26:49,968 --> 02:26:51,368
Seconded by Councilor Sang.

1564
02:26:51,448 --> 02:26:52,929

The motion passes.

1579
02:27:19,290 --> 02:27:22,031
We had three motions from Councilor Scarpelli.

1580
02:27:22,591 --> 02:27:28,933
The first was to adopt a residential factor of 0.905493 for the fiscal year 2026 property tax levy.

1581
02:27:28,953 --> 02:27:30,813
Is that a good vote? 0.905494.

1582
02:27:52,096 --> 02:27:53,837
And do you need us to say anything else in the motion?

1583
02:27:53,857 --> 02:27:55,438
All right, great.

1584
02:27:56,979 --> 02:27:59,500

1602
02:28:33,255 --> 02:28:36,237

Yes.

1608
02:28:55,014 --> 02:28:55,934
Councilor Zaro.

1609
02:28:57,334 --> 02:28:58,015
Councilor Lemming.

1610
02:28:58,035 --> 02:28:58,095
Yes.

1611
02:28:59,355 --> 02:29:00,235
Councilor Scarpelli.

1612
02:29:00,255 --> 02:29:00,335
Yes.

1613
02:29:01,455 --> 02:29:02,135

Six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

1618

Motion passes.

1619
02:29:08,956 --> 02:29:14,617
And then there was a motion by Councilor Scarpelli to not adopt a small commercial exemption, seconded by?

1620
02:29:14,637 --> 02:29:14,697
Yes.

1621
02:29:16,198 --> 02:29:17,378
Seconded by Councilor Sang.

1622
02:29:19,366 --> 02:29:20,626
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1623
02:29:23,387 --> 02:29:24,268
Councilor Callahan.

1624
02:29:25,848 --> 02:29:26,929
Vice President Collins.

1625
02:29:27,389 --> 02:29:27,629
Yes.

1626
02:29:29,209 --> 02:29:30,070
Councilor Zaro.

1627
02:29:31,630 --> 02:29:32,331
Councilor Lemming.

1628
02:29:33,791 --> 02:29:34,711
Councilor Scarpelli.

1629
02:29:36,052 --> 02:29:36,812
Councilor Singh.

1630
02:29:37,692 --> 02:29:38,513
President Behrs.

1631
02:29:38,733 --> 02:29:38,933
Yes.

1632
02:29:38,953 --> 02:29:40,613
So I have an affirmative, none of the negative.

1633
02:29:40,633 --> 02:29:41,694
The motion passes.

1634
02:29:43,654 --> 02:29:44,195
Thanks, Jared.

1635
02:29:48,017 --> 02:29:53,261
motions orders and resolutions to 5, 1, 7, 6, offered by president bears and counselor Callahan.

1636
02:29:54,121 --> 02:30:00,366
Whereas the mayor and city administration recently announced the receipt of a $200,000 grant for Medford zero waste initiative.

1637
02:30:00,646 --> 02:30:09,172
And whereas as part of this initiative, the mayor announced that her administration would reduce tax collection, trash collection to once every two weeks, starting in July, 2027.

1638
02:30:09,212 --> 02:30:16,478
And whereas the city council supports efforts to reduce waste increases to free weekly composting and limit cost growth of waste collection.

1639
02:30:17,178 --> 02:30:37,711
that has hurt our city budget and whereas residents have very significant concerns about the impact of reducing trash collection to once every two weeks for residents and the need for greater efforts by the mayor to inform and engage residents regarding our solid waste collection program changes now therefore be it resolved by the medford city council that the mayor and city administration provide a report to the council and residents explaining the changes

1640
02:30:38,371 --> 02:30:40,812
they are making to the city's waste collection program.

1641
02:30:41,292 --> 02:30:48,134
Be it for the resolve that the mayor, city administration share all resources that they are making available to residents to reduce any negative impacts of these changes.

1642
02:30:48,614 --> 02:30:56,597
Be it for the resolve that the mayor and city administration hold a public forum to hear from residents about their concerns and explore potential alternative options to move the city towards zero waste goals.

1643
02:30:57,177 --> 02:31:02,399
Be it for the resolve that the city council appreciates the work of our DPW commissioner and planning development and sustainability director.

1644
02:31:02,899 --> 02:31:17,754
The council requests that the mayor provide additional resources for our dedicated city staff so they have the capacity to effectively communicate with residents regarding the proposed timeline and reasoning for these changes, explore the benefits and costs of alternative timelines and plans, and outline a mitigation strategy to address any negative impacts.

1645
02:31:17,914 --> 02:31:18,655
Councilor Callahan.

1646
02:31:22,342 --> 02:31:22,642
Thank you.

1647
02:31:24,024 --> 02:31:36,177
I think we, certainly I, I'll speak for myself, I do understand the purpose of this change.

1648
02:31:36,357 --> 02:31:41,042
I know that the waste collection costs have been going up.

1649
02:31:41,803 --> 02:31:43,725
a lot.

1650
02:31:43,745 --> 02:31:56,498
And also just in terms of climate change, wanting to be a sustainable city, moving toward more composting and offering our composting for free, and that hopefully that will naturally reduce the amount of trash.

1651
02:31:57,199 --> 02:31:58,900
These are laudable goals.

1652
02:32:00,121 --> 02:32:01,503
The problem is that

1653
02:32:03,283 --> 02:32:18,529
This was brought up in like the 11th paragraph of a statement about composting and people are getting this and realizing suddenly that a service that they depend upon is about to be cut in half.

1654
02:32:20,311 --> 02:32:33,671
It's really important to me that when we have climate goals that those climate goals are something that the residents of our city understand the residents of our city can get behind that we not have climate goals be something negative that people.

1655
02:32:34,732 --> 02:32:37,733
dislike and see as a bad thing.

1656
02:32:38,913 --> 02:32:52,297
So really all we're asking for is for this, the rollout to be done right, to make sure that we meet our residents' needs, that we offer any alternatives if necessary for the things that people come up with.

1657
02:32:53,237 --> 02:32:59,419
So we really just want to make sure that this rollout is done the right way and that our residents are fully informed.

1658
02:32:59,439 --> 02:32:59,879
Thank you.

1659
02:33:01,700 --> 02:33:02,740
Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

1660
02:33:04,168 --> 02:33:22,623
You know, I maybe see it a little bit differently, although we are co-sponsors of this resolution, I just, the city is not ready for a change of this magnitude and the way that it was announced was at the best burying the lead and at worst, deeply confusing and worrying.

1661
02:33:25,677 --> 02:33:30,980
I also understand, right, maybe some of the motivations here outside of health insurance and pension costs.

1662
02:33:31,040 --> 02:33:34,581
One of the things that is cost going up the fastest is our waste removal contract.

1663
02:33:35,162 --> 02:33:43,946
The flip side of that is that the one thing that every resident in the way they interact with the city every week is trash and recycling and compost.

1664
02:33:44,466 --> 02:33:51,289
It's the one thing that the city does for any resident in a one, two, three family home every week.

1665
02:33:52,095 --> 02:34:02,644
And I think the idea of essentially announcing to the city that that's going to change in paragraph 10 of a press release that says we just got a big grant, not even a big grant.

1666
02:34:02,664 --> 02:34:08,228
We just got a $200,000 grant and it's a $220 million city budget is not the way to do this.

1667
02:34:08,989 --> 02:34:17,936
Even if I 100% understand the intent and agree with the goals, you know, we had a conversation with the administration two years ago,

1668
02:34:18,799 --> 02:34:39,994
that said we're moving to a new waste contract, we're bringing in free composting, there's going to be a bunch of benchmarks and checks along the way, and at some point we're going to come back to you and say, we think we've done enough education of the public, we think that we have enough uptake on the composting program, we're seeing changes in the way that people are putting their trash out.

1669
02:34:40,634 --> 02:34:50,724
And that that was going to then inform a process where you go out to residents and say, hey, we've done a lot together over the past few years around changing our waste stream.

1670
02:34:51,405 --> 02:35:01,415
And we think that we now have met some conditions and there's enough time for us to have a conversation about making a change to trash.

1671
02:35:03,177 --> 02:35:04,138
But this is not that.

1672
02:35:05,547 --> 02:35:09,249
that groundwork laying, I have not seen it.

1673
02:35:09,289 --> 02:35:17,832
We have not had a bunch of meetings in this body or we have not seen a bunch of public meetings and public forums hosted by the city saying, here's the update on the composting program.

1674
02:35:18,293 --> 02:35:22,815
We're actually seeing that the trash, you know, our trash weight is going down, the bins are less full.

1675
02:35:23,175 --> 02:35:28,177
We're not seeing any of the benchmarks that would lead us to believe that this is a good change.

1676
02:35:29,337 --> 02:35:34,460
And I think to have not laid that groundwork and then for us to, you know,

1677
02:35:35,560 --> 02:35:53,489
The fact that this was not the lead of the press release, that the press release wasn't titled City Planning to Move to Every Other Week Trash Removal in 2027, and then saying at least some of the stuff that we were told we were going to hear, I think has rubbed a lot of people the wrong way.

1678
02:35:53,509 --> 02:35:55,150
I think it set up

1679
02:35:55,850 --> 02:35:59,551
quite frankly, this program for failure, because I think there's not trust in it.

1680
02:36:00,832 --> 02:36:10,536
And I think it's a yet another example where the resources for communication have not been provided to the people who are tasked with communicating about major changes.

1681
02:36:12,376 --> 02:36:14,697
I heard that message loud and clear six months ago about zoning.

1682
02:36:15,378 --> 02:36:16,138
And here we are again.

1683
02:36:16,898 --> 02:36:29,970
about trash removal, where it's paragraph 10 of a wall of text posted on the website and not something where we've been laying the groundwork, not something where in July, right?

1684
02:36:31,512 --> 02:36:32,953
There's been discussions for months.

1685
02:36:33,193 --> 02:36:37,297
Why in July of this year did the city not say we want to start laying the groundwork for this?

1686
02:36:39,179 --> 02:36:41,922
And I think the hardest part of that is that we do not have

1687
02:36:43,060 --> 02:36:49,284
other than the voice that we're putting forward and the requests that we're making for information, the city council doesn't have a vote on this.

1688
02:36:49,484 --> 02:36:53,827
City council can't say, no, this isn't happening or no, it has to be delayed.

1689
02:36:55,428 --> 02:36:56,328
It doesn't sit with us.

1690
02:36:56,788 --> 02:37:00,471
So I have a lot of concerns about the way this was rolled out.

1691
02:37:01,591 --> 02:37:04,233
And I don't think, I think, you know, it's been,

1692
02:37:05,365 --> 02:37:09,652
interesting to have conversations with residents of all political stripes.

1693
02:37:10,493 --> 02:37:16,222
We just had an election where a lot of people voted for one side and a bunch of other people voted for another group of folks.

1694
02:37:16,843 --> 02:37:19,267
And I've heard from folks on both sides of that.

1695
02:37:20,371 --> 02:37:22,752
who are very frustrated with this.

1696
02:37:22,892 --> 02:37:27,593
And some of those folks are saying, I would never support this, period, no matter what the rollout was.

1697
02:37:28,033 --> 02:37:41,098
And some folks are saying, this actually, I support it 100%, but I'm worried about, and it would work for my house, but I'm worried about the people who it won't work for, and I don't know what the plan is, and I'm worried about what the negative impacts are going to be.

1698
02:37:41,978 --> 02:37:46,799
So that's why I co-sponsored this resolution with Councilor Callahan.

1699
02:37:46,899 --> 02:37:48,500
I think really,

1700
02:37:50,682 --> 02:37:52,343
put the cart before the horse on this one.

1701
02:37:53,244 --> 02:37:56,167
And I'm very concerned about this change.

1702
02:37:58,088 --> 02:37:58,909
What are councilors saying?

1703
02:38:02,632 --> 02:38:07,816
Thank you, President Behrs and Councilor Callahan for introducing this resolution.

1704
02:38:08,797 --> 02:38:16,183
Reducing waste, saving taxpayer money and preparing residents for potential statewide food waste ban are all important noble goals, but

1705
02:38:16,700 --> 02:38:28,342
burying what feels like an austerity cut to waste services inside an opaque press release about grant funding has caused real frustration and undermined trust with residents, and frankly, with counselors as well.

1706
02:38:29,142 --> 02:38:35,323
Many of us, including those of us on this council, learned about the administration's final decision through social media.

1707
02:38:36,104 --> 02:38:44,125
This is exactly the kind of governance by press release I've spoke strongly against years ago, and I'm going to speak strongly against it tonight as well.

1708
02:38:45,229 --> 02:38:51,594
This approach has also jeopardized support for the Zero Waste Project, which is central to our climate action and adaptation plan.

1709
02:38:52,255 --> 02:39:11,891
As the youngest member of this council, I know in my bones that climate change is an existential threat, but something I really worry about are things like this, where the failure of the outreach process means that for too many neighbors, saving the planet now feels synonymous with inconvenience, making people just want to give up on the environment writ large.

1710
02:39:12,749 --> 02:39:17,310
We end up moving farther away from where we need to be, fundamentally undermining the green movement.

1711
02:39:18,330 --> 02:39:24,191
We need to rebuild trust and communicate clearly so residents understand that this doesn't have to be the case.

1712
02:39:25,392 --> 02:39:38,175
I went back to old meeting minutes in my own notes from years ago, and we were told back then that while this could be a future path, the city would for sure conduct comprehensive outreach before moving forward down this path.

1713
02:39:38,695 --> 02:39:39,975
And speaking only for myself,

1714
02:39:41,184 --> 02:39:46,328
I need a clearer plan from the mayor and her administration before I can consider supporting this change.

1715
02:39:47,049 --> 02:39:50,271
We need answers to basic and practical questions.

1716
02:39:51,192 --> 02:39:54,835
Questions like, what alternative routes are there to reducing waste?

1717
02:39:55,375 --> 02:39:57,637
Will recycling move to a weekly schedule as well?

1718
02:39:58,137 --> 02:40:00,940
How successful has the composting program been so far?

1719
02:40:01,858 --> 02:40:09,925
We know that compost bins are more rat-proof, but imperfect composting practices will still mean that food waste might sit out longer.

1720
02:40:10,566 --> 02:40:12,327
What's the rodent mitigation plan there?

1721
02:40:13,048 --> 02:40:14,349
That's a question I asked years ago.

1722
02:40:15,170 --> 02:40:19,434
What's the plan for the summer months when heat accelerates rot and odor?

1723
02:40:20,134 --> 02:40:24,318
What outreach has been done to residents, especially to those who don't speak English?

1724
02:40:25,635 --> 02:40:29,136
Have we analyzed equity impacts on low-income and working-class families?

1725
02:40:29,596 --> 02:40:36,038
And what have we learned from other municipalities that have moved from trash, weekly trash pickups to this pay-as-you-throw system?

1726
02:40:36,419 --> 02:40:37,359
What outreach did they do?

1727
02:40:38,919 --> 02:40:43,821
These are some, you know, some of these questions are questions that residents, the community have been talking about.

1728
02:40:44,081 --> 02:40:46,382
Some of them are questions that I've been talking about for a while.

1729
02:40:48,447 --> 02:40:58,412
And, you know, to the president's point, one major lesson that this council has learned, especially from our zoning process, is that when we do big things, we have to do them right.

1730
02:40:59,313 --> 02:41:01,714
Residents have told us that loud and clear.

1731
02:41:02,474 --> 02:41:04,976
The question now is, is the mayor listening?

1732
02:41:05,956 --> 02:41:13,320
I do want to acknowledge the hard work that Commissioner McGibbon and Director Hunt have put in to this, to their work every day.

1733
02:41:14,353 --> 02:41:19,814
This has been a tough week, I'm sure for them, and they've worked tirelessly for our city, not just now, but every day.

1734
02:41:21,155 --> 02:41:31,157
Most importantly, I think this should and can be a moment for us to come together as a community, not to assign blame, but to work through the substance.

1735
02:41:31,737 --> 02:41:40,239
Let's have an open and honest discussion so that none of our hard waste in City Hall and out with our community goes to waste.

1736
02:41:44,661 --> 02:41:45,341
Councilor Scarpa.

1737
02:41:46,482 --> 02:41:47,442
Thank you, Mr. President.

1738
02:41:47,542 --> 02:41:52,404
And I think that I just have a few to add on to my colleague.

1739
02:41:52,424 --> 02:41:58,747
I think my colleagues said some interesting points and we've definitely heard the residents.

1740
02:41:59,167 --> 02:42:05,790
And I think if we can have a B, C and D paper, because I think it's important because I know that

1741
02:42:06,743 --> 02:42:14,590
The team has done some extensive research, but have we looked at other avenues to help support the trash contract?

1742
02:42:14,690 --> 02:42:28,161
One thing we've been hearing a lot of lately is illegal dumping and to see if there's any thought process of using funding from penalties from illegal dumping to maybe defray the cost of

1743
02:42:28,947 --> 02:42:29,567
the contract.

1744
02:42:29,607 --> 02:42:36,772
It might not sound like a lot, but I think if what we're seeing, that could be something that is an avenue we can look at.

1745
02:42:38,093 --> 02:42:40,694
If we can, Mr. President, there's a C paper.

1746
02:42:41,134 --> 02:42:41,975
I think it's important.

1747
02:42:42,015 --> 02:42:45,197
I think Councilor Sang brought it up, but I think it's important that we get

1748
02:42:45,741 --> 02:43:03,113
the information back in a paper that it's important to see what the Board of Health looks at the rat infestation, the issue with the rat problem, and a report of anticipating impact if we go down to, when we go down to once every two weeks.

1749
02:43:03,753 --> 02:43:05,214
And then last is a D paper.

1750
02:43:05,234 --> 02:43:10,798
I think it's having a detailed report to understand the life after that $200,000 and see the impact that it might

1751
02:43:14,587 --> 02:43:27,991
on the city and what gains we might have had to that $200,000, and then how we pick up and continue with that, any positive reinforcement from that $200,000.

1752
02:43:28,051 --> 02:43:42,555
So if you can, oblige the papers, just because I think that this is a resolution that we can get some answers back and maybe help our residents understand, because I think that that's important.

1753
02:43:42,615 --> 02:43:43,075
So thank you.

1754
02:43:44,156 --> 02:43:48,618
Yeah, yeah, if you can yeah if you can add actually to those trying to write I'm trying to write.

1755
02:43:48,959 --> 02:43:53,541
All right, George I had.

1756
02:43:53,561 --> 02:43:58,004
And maybe we could take these all in as amendments on the main paper is that fine to do that.

1757
02:43:58,244 --> 02:44:05,348
Yeah, I'd be resolved the city administration explore using fines for for illegal dumping to fund the waste removal contract.

1758
02:44:06,377 --> 02:44:13,021
be resolved that the Board of Health provide a report on expected impact of moving to biweekly trash collection on the city's rodent problem.

1759
02:44:15,103 --> 02:44:22,568
And the last one, sorry, I was- The impact after the $200,000 grant and- Like when it runs out?

1760
02:44:22,648 --> 02:44:32,234
When it runs out, what the outlook and anything that's positive, how are we going to fund anything positive off of that, so.

1761
02:44:34,055 --> 02:44:35,376
Thank you, Mr. President.

1762
02:44:37,222 --> 02:44:39,083
And Councilor Sang, do you want to read yours again?

1763
02:44:39,103 --> 02:44:42,644
To you guys.

1764
02:44:43,644 --> 02:44:44,384
Give me one sec.

1765
02:44:50,626 --> 02:44:56,768
While alternative routes are there to reducing waste, will recycling move to a weekly schedule as well?

1766
02:44:57,868 --> 02:45:01,069
How successful has the composting program been so far?

1767
02:45:02,498 --> 02:45:07,602
Compost bins are more rat-proof, but imperfect composting still means food waste might sit out longer.

1768
02:45:08,043 --> 02:45:12,027
What's the road mitigation plan along the lines of what Councilor Scarpelli said?

1769
02:45:12,687 --> 02:45:16,011
What's the plan for summer months when heat accelerates rotten odor?

1770
02:45:16,811 --> 02:45:20,975
What outreach has been done to residents, especially to non-English speaking communities?

1771
02:45:21,816 --> 02:45:25,560
Have we analyzed equity impacts on low income and working class families?

1772
02:45:26,454 --> 02:45:33,877
And what have we learned from other municipalities that moved from weekly trash pickup to pay-as-you-throw systems, and what outreach did they do?

1773
02:45:35,918 --> 02:45:36,178
Great.

1774
02:45:36,658 --> 02:45:44,422
All right, we'll incorporate all of that, unless Councilor Kallion, you have an objection to incorporating those amendments into our resolution?

1775
02:45:45,602 --> 02:45:45,862
All right.

1776
02:45:47,963 --> 02:45:52,585
Are there further comments from members of the Council on this paper?

1777
02:45:57,060 --> 02:45:57,862
Councillor Collins.

1778
02:46:02,411 --> 02:46:07,963
Thank you, President bears, and I'll keep it short because my fellow councillors have already spoken to a lot of what

1779
02:46:09,420 --> 02:46:11,101
was on my mind about this resolution.

1780
02:46:11,121 --> 02:46:13,602
I want to thank you and Councilor Callahan for bringing it forward.

1781
02:46:14,102 --> 02:46:27,087
And, you know, I served as a member of the Solid Waste Task Force back in 2022, which I know is referenced on the Mayor's kind of brand new FAQ sheet about the Pay As You Throw program now that it's been announced.

1782
02:46:28,768 --> 02:46:35,611
And, you know, I just wanted to speak to the fact that the Pay As You Throw program and various options and methods for

1783
02:46:36,811 --> 02:46:48,936
over time, finding ways to make it feasible to decrease our waste production and ramp up recycling and ramp up composting and have those things occurring at concert, were thoroughly discussed on the task force.

1784
02:46:48,976 --> 02:47:03,601
Another thing that was spoken about, you know, time and time again, was the need for really intentional, really thorough, really comprehensive communication and outreach to the community about

1785
02:47:05,084 --> 02:47:14,753
significant changes such as this about, you know, what it would mean for recycling to increase in frequency or trash pickup to decrease in frequency or composting and how that works.

1786
02:47:14,813 --> 02:47:24,622
And a lot of the questions that Councillor Tsang just raised, knowing that people would, you know, that any significant change to our waste pickup would be

1787
02:47:25,588 --> 02:47:37,234
a significant change for people because this is just a part of life that we can't get away from, and how important it would be for any new trash contract to include resources for really doing the public outreach part right.

1788
02:47:37,395 --> 02:47:41,277
And I think, you know, I wouldn't speak for any other member of the task force, but my impressions

1789
02:47:42,977 --> 02:47:57,142
From our meetings, which were three years ago, was that there was broad consensus that we needed any significant changes would need to be preceded by and coupled with just a really sincere and dedicated

1790
02:47:59,788 --> 02:48:08,812
outreach and communication program to make sure that people knew it was happening, knew why it was happening, had their questions answered, felt on board, because these changes are significant.

1791
02:48:08,892 --> 02:48:09,613
It's not intuitive.

1792
02:48:09,673 --> 02:48:15,015
And we need to, and you know, all these questions that Councillor Tsang raised and others are ones that are on the minds of residents.

1793
02:48:15,616 --> 02:48:24,300
So as a member of the former Solid Waste Task Force, you know, I had no idea that this was how the administration was planning to roll out this change.

1794
02:48:25,621 --> 02:48:47,500
because so many of our conversations were really guided by the fact that, you know, any major change involving or recycling our compost or our trash pickup would need to be preceded by such thorough outreach into the community to really get people on board and, you know, to take the time to win people over to why these approaches are both good and feasible.

1795
02:48:48,572 --> 02:48:54,114
And really, you know, taking the time to convince people of both and to wait for the evidence of the feasibility.

1796
02:48:56,355 --> 02:49:01,157
So I really hope that the, I hope that we see some follow up from this resolution.

1797
02:49:01,197 --> 02:49:03,197
I really hope that the administration takes this to heart.

1798
02:49:04,558 --> 02:49:08,799
And like you said, Mr. President, I think this is one that it's really important to get this right.

1799
02:49:08,819 --> 02:49:10,420
We can't be putting the cart before the horse.

1800
02:49:10,620 --> 02:49:10,840
Thank you.

1801
02:49:14,565 --> 02:49:14,945
Thank you.

1802
02:49:15,005 --> 02:49:18,128
Are there any further comments from members of the council on this resolution?

1803
02:49:20,470 --> 02:49:24,773
Seeing none, we'll take a public input on this resolution, both in-person and on Zoom.

1804
02:49:24,853 --> 02:49:30,638
In-person, you can make a line behind the podium, and on Zoom, you can raise your hand on Zoom.

1805
02:49:31,098 --> 02:49:35,622
We'll alternate between in-person and on Zoom, and each person will have three minutes.

1806
02:49:36,423 --> 02:49:37,223
Start at the podium.

1807
02:49:37,684 --> 02:49:40,186
Name and address for the record, please.

1808
02:49:41,940 --> 02:49:43,701
Sure, Micah Kesselman, 499 Main Street.

1809
02:49:46,382 --> 02:50:00,867
So it's hilarious that the chief of staff had the thankless job of coming up here at the beginning of this meeting saying that you should just take the mayor at her word on

1810
02:50:03,248 --> 02:50:08,750
a whole process that needs to engage more community outreach and more residents.

1811
02:50:09,690 --> 02:50:14,772
And then this Takaka nonsense happens the same day.

1812
02:50:14,792 --> 02:50:27,857
And I think it really goes to show exactly why you were requesting, not requesting, like demanding that she publicly put forward

1813
02:50:28,865 --> 02:50:34,449
the key things that she is expecting and demanding to continue funding zoning.

1814
02:50:35,349 --> 02:50:39,092
Because you can't take her at her word, clearly.

1815
02:50:40,113 --> 02:50:41,734
Look at this, this is wild.

1816
02:50:42,434 --> 02:50:46,797
And for the record, I'm in support of this project.

1817
02:50:46,917 --> 02:50:49,819
I think I agree with what my counselors have said.

1818
02:50:49,839 --> 02:50:50,740
It's a great goal.

1819
02:50:51,560 --> 02:50:53,262
It's important.

1820
02:50:53,802 --> 02:50:55,063
It's a really important goal.

1821
02:50:55,940 --> 02:51:02,505
And I don't think personally I'll have that big of a practical impact on myself, but you're right.

1822
02:51:02,626 --> 02:51:10,472
I mean, trash pickup is one of those like fundamental things that a city does and engages its residents on.

1823
02:51:11,112 --> 02:51:22,922
And it's beyond crazy that the mayor would do this at the same time she's trying to put forward the idea that

1824
02:51:24,735 --> 02:51:37,360
You should just take her at her word and sort of individual email Daisy Chained across the council on other citywide impacting endeavors.

1825
02:51:38,500 --> 02:51:45,943
So yeah, I just want to say, this resolution should be followed up on.

1826
02:51:46,753 --> 02:51:48,194
by the administration.

1827
02:51:50,275 --> 02:51:51,135
It's critical.

1828
02:51:52,015 --> 02:51:53,936
I mean, yeah.

1829
02:51:54,636 --> 02:51:56,877
So hopefully this works.

1830
02:51:58,618 --> 02:51:59,078
Thank you.

1831
02:51:59,098 --> 02:52:01,899
I'm going to go to Zoom, then I'll come back to the podium.

1832
02:52:02,520 --> 02:52:05,641
Robert Carney, name and address for the record, and you'll have three minutes.

1833
02:52:07,348 --> 02:52:10,229
Hey, Robert Carney, 50 Hicks Ave, Unit 6.

1834
02:52:11,330 --> 02:52:15,311
I also just want to, first of all, thank you for getting this conversation started.

1835
02:52:15,331 --> 02:52:17,833
I also want to speak as a townhouse owner here.

1836
02:52:18,293 --> 02:52:27,777
Many of you likely remember the September 30th city council meeting where we talked about another communication and process change from the city.

1837
02:52:28,257 --> 02:52:32,319
And that was the proposed cessation of trash and recycling services

1838
02:52:33,419 --> 02:52:36,902
you know, for townhomes with five plus units.

1839
02:52:37,182 --> 02:52:57,356
And just kind of a little bit of what I'd like to say here is I'm glad we're talking about this, but we feel like, you know, me and my wife would love to also just be presented with either from the council or the mayor, the full details of all these waste management contracts, you know, more detail about the proposal,

1840
02:52:58,414 --> 02:53:10,281
In the townhouse example, I want to connect this with some of the other complaints you all have, because for us, getting clear information was frustratingly difficult, despite multiple efforts on me and my wife's part since the summer.

1841
02:53:11,962 --> 02:53:24,850
So, you know, when we received this letter in July about the proposed cessation of services from, you know, about townhouses, my wife and I were receiving seemingly contradictory information.

1842
02:53:24,890 --> 02:53:26,611
So, like, you know, Councillor Collins,

1843
02:53:27,854 --> 02:53:32,099
was mentioning the task force has a minimum influence on the final contract.

1844
02:53:32,279 --> 02:53:33,701
Tim McGivern said the opposite.

1845
02:53:34,201 --> 02:53:43,813
Tim McGivern said the council approved the program after extensive briefing, yet some counselors seemed unfamiliar with key details of this earlier contract before

1846
02:53:44,863 --> 02:53:46,024
We're talking about this change here.

1847
02:53:46,545 --> 02:53:54,812
So, you know, I think this is an opportunity as you all are saying for the city leadership, the mayor and the council to rely heavily on citizen input about this.

1848
02:53:55,472 --> 02:54:05,922
I think we can work together without sacrificing, you know, community cohesion or excluding townhouses from essential services and reduce our waste and make this equitable.

1849
02:54:06,802 --> 02:54:15,766
Um, and I also want to bring the townhouse thing up because I think this is relevant here, you know, the proposed cessation of trash and recycling services.

1850
02:54:17,127 --> 02:54:19,808
And a non committal to compost services.

1851
02:54:20,108 --> 02:54:22,569
It seems like the city might do it for townhouses.

1852
02:54:23,209 --> 02:54:23,690
How does that.

1853
02:54:25,342 --> 02:54:45,175
you know, address city services goals to save waste, you know, especially when it seems like we're going to be saving money by reducing the amount of trash, you know, being collected if this goes through, our townhouse is still going to be left off, especially ones that are like for us, we're like paying 5000 a year in property taxes.

1854
02:54:45,255 --> 02:54:49,877
So, you know, just want to bring that up to hopefully we can keep that top of mind for the mayor.

1855
02:54:50,298 --> 02:54:50,598
Thank you.

1856
02:54:53,480 --> 02:54:54,261
Thank you, Robert.

1857
02:54:54,761 --> 02:54:56,303
We'll go back to the podium.

1858
02:54:57,084 --> 02:54:58,545
Name and address for the record, please.

1859
02:54:58,605 --> 02:54:59,647
And you'll have three minutes.

1860
02:55:00,187 --> 02:55:03,551
Hi, I'm Julia Foster and my address is 239 Woburn Street.

1861
02:55:04,692 --> 02:55:07,195
I wanted to address a couple of things on this topic.

1862
02:55:07,355 --> 02:55:10,458
First, I compost.

1863
02:55:10,638 --> 02:55:12,220
I'm a fan of the composting program.

1864
02:55:12,811 --> 02:55:15,072
I want it to continue, and I want it to grow.

1865
02:55:15,173 --> 02:55:19,355
So I sort of am the demographic that this is aimed for.

1866
02:55:19,955 --> 02:55:23,978
But I'm not in favor of the way it's currently proposed for a variety of reasons.

1867
02:55:24,158 --> 02:55:30,402
The pay-it program, based on discussions at the open house I had yesterday, it doesn't mandate every other week in the slightest.

1868
02:55:30,442 --> 02:55:34,565
It just mandates reduction to 32 gallons per week pickup.

1869
02:55:35,585 --> 02:55:47,899
But we can't afford to reissue trash from 64 to 32, and we can't afford the expense of the weekly pickup if we want to afford universal free composting.

1870
02:55:48,339 --> 02:55:55,447
So it's sort of a, how do you achieve this goal without then switching to every other week?

1871
02:55:57,345 --> 02:56:10,576
I have a suggestion for that, which is to let people keep their 64 and keep the weekly, but if you want to keep the 64 instead of being reduced to 32 weekly, you have to pay for that.

1872
02:56:11,436 --> 02:56:14,699
So it would offset the cost significantly.

1873
02:56:17,501 --> 02:56:20,544
You'd keep weekly, but if you didn't need it,

1874
02:56:22,002 --> 02:56:23,263
you could go down to 32.

1875
02:56:23,483 --> 02:56:26,606
If you wanted to keep the 64 weekly, you'd have to pay to keep it.

1876
02:56:27,967 --> 02:56:29,848
The flip side of that is that that's not possible.

1877
02:56:31,109 --> 02:56:38,975
And we end up having to switch to every other week, which again, based on discussions I had yesterday, you won't get much guidance on how other cities are doing it because they're not.

1878
02:56:39,856 --> 02:56:46,261
No city in the Pay It program in Massachusetts has adopted an every other week trash pickup.

1879
02:56:46,521 --> 02:56:50,304
They've gone down to 32 gallon buckets every week.

1880
02:56:51,203 --> 02:56:56,785
And part of the reason for that, that I think everybody here has recognized, is the concerns about sanitation.

1881
02:56:57,605 --> 02:57:15,492
So if it is switched from one week to every other week, there has to be some sort of addressing, what are we doing with feminine hygiene products, dog poop bags, diapers, and other things that can't be composted and that will absolutely be repulsive

1882
02:57:16,367 --> 02:57:25,740
Well, after two weeks any time of the year, the dog poop bags start to disintegrate before the end of the week and have to be dealt with already.

1883
02:57:28,553 --> 02:57:33,794
So, and then the one-off situations where you throw a party at your house and you have a ton of trash.

1884
02:57:33,834 --> 02:57:41,516
It's one thing to store boxes from a Christmas and big Amazon and driving it to recycling drop-off.

1885
02:57:42,236 --> 02:57:44,577
It's another thing to do that with trash.

1886
02:57:45,317 --> 02:57:51,458
I don't have any interest in keeping that in my garage for an extended period of time or in my driveway for two weeks at a time.

1887
02:57:52,359 --> 02:57:56,080
So, those are my two concerns and thank you.

1888
02:57:57,100 --> 02:57:57,960
Thank you for your comment.

1889
02:57:59,539 --> 02:58:01,041
We will go back to Zoom.

1890
02:58:01,321 --> 02:58:03,183
We'll go to Cheryl on Zoom.

1891
02:58:03,243 --> 02:58:05,085
Cheryl, name and address for the record, please.

1892
02:58:05,105 --> 02:58:06,106
And you'll have three minutes.

1893
02:58:07,461 --> 02:58:10,102
Hi, Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street.

1894
02:58:10,802 --> 02:58:20,446
So meat packaging, takeout containers, pizza boxes, pet waste and diapers are just a few items that attract rats and are neither compostable nor recyclable.

1895
02:58:21,186 --> 02:58:24,927
Bi-monthly trash pickup is negligent and ignores the social contract.

1896
02:58:25,327 --> 02:58:26,688
No other city is doing this.

1897
02:58:27,148 --> 02:58:30,549
It is unsanitary and our rat population will explode.

1898
02:58:31,049 --> 02:58:36,031
I have to keep my compost bin in the house because it was outside for one week and was all caught up.

1899
02:58:36,471 --> 02:58:39,172
Our trash cans don't even close as well as the compost bins.

1900
02:58:39,832 --> 02:58:46,615
This will hit the dense environmental justice neighborhoods the hardest, and increasing our density will worsen it more still.

1901
02:58:47,315 --> 02:58:51,517
With our current rat problems, was the Board of Health consulted about this change?

1902
02:58:52,457 --> 02:58:56,259
What Malden looked like during the trash strike will become our new normal.

1903
02:58:56,999 --> 02:59:00,420
Bi-monthly trash pickup is disgusting and irresponsible.

1904
02:59:00,901 --> 02:59:03,582
We should not encourage our rat population to grow.

1905
02:59:04,342 --> 02:59:05,783
This is a basic service.

1906
02:59:06,463 --> 02:59:09,744
And if it is about money, then we need to find something else to cut.

1907
02:59:10,224 --> 02:59:19,988
If it is just about chasing a $200,000 grant, then we need to let that one go in the interest of our quality of life, because this is neither good nor feasible.

1908
02:59:20,508 --> 02:59:30,212
And I wonder what else is hidden inside this contract that we'll only find out in paragraph 11 of a press release about a grant that is supposed to be good with the bad hidden beneath.

1909
02:59:30,712 --> 02:59:31,032
Thank you.

1910
02:59:33,638 --> 02:59:34,539
Thank you for your comment.

1911
02:59:35,059 --> 02:59:36,400
We'll go back to the podium.

1912
02:59:36,700 --> 02:59:38,041
Name and address for the record, please.

1913
02:59:38,081 --> 02:59:39,503
And you'll have three minutes.

1914
02:59:40,363 --> 02:59:42,265
Good evening, Nick Giroleo, 40 Robinson Road.

1915
02:59:42,825 --> 02:59:47,029
I'm speaking tonight in favor of this resolution, both originally or as amended.

1916
02:59:47,689 --> 02:59:51,452
What's most stunning to me is how little it seems we're getting in return for this grant.

1917
02:59:52,100 --> 02:59:58,884
In exchange for this huge sacrifice of cutting our trash collection pickup in half, we're getting, drumroll please, compost bins.

1918
02:59:59,545 --> 03:00:04,668
Now, it's $200,000 worth of compost bins, but again, it's still just compost bins.

1919
03:00:05,208 --> 03:00:07,210
I'm asking myself, do we actually need more?

1920
03:00:07,390 --> 03:00:08,190
Is there a shortage?

1921
03:00:08,690 --> 03:00:09,931
Are there answers to these questions?

1922
03:00:10,011 --> 03:00:11,112
I can look up.

1923
03:00:12,354 --> 03:00:20,457
And I think if we had discretion to spend this money any way we'd like for waste management funding, there'd be a case perhaps for this trade-off.

1924
03:00:20,517 --> 03:00:26,839
But since it appears we're just stuck using it for these bins, I don't see anyone could make the case this is a good deal.

1925
03:00:27,940 --> 03:00:35,962
Now, the city says if we generate too much trash, we can just buy overflow bags or lease for $12 a month another 64-gallon bin.

1926
03:00:36,443 --> 03:00:37,263
No big deal, huh?

1927
03:00:38,462 --> 03:00:42,584
For many people, the weekly pickup with the 64-gallon bin is hard enough as it is.

1928
03:00:43,324 --> 03:00:50,368
And even with, I think, intentional efforts to produce less rubbish, it is still highly unrealistic people are going to be able to meet this quota.

1929
03:00:51,028 --> 03:00:54,390
And all this is going to do is force them to pay these fees.

1930
03:00:55,010 --> 03:00:59,833
Residents are already struggling under high taxes and fees and a climate of a cost-of-living crisis.

1931
03:01:00,333 --> 03:01:02,094
This is only going to make that struggling worse.

1932
03:01:03,062 --> 03:01:11,726
And it also makes you question when we're told that tax hikes are necessary to fund essential city services, and we say yes, why we are getting less city services in return.

1933
03:01:11,746 --> 03:01:15,827
And we're also getting a vague promise here that this will save the environment.

1934
03:01:16,247 --> 03:01:21,249
How do we know collecting trash less regularly is going to incentivize people to produce less trash?

1935
03:01:22,030 --> 03:01:27,512
What will stop people from dumping their extra trash or just sucking it up and paying for overfill bags or renting a bin?

1936
03:01:28,907 --> 03:01:32,650
As has been discussed, our neighborhoods are already infested with rats in many areas.

1937
03:01:33,410 --> 03:01:42,696
Unsustainable density increases due to comprehensive residential rezoning changes, which do seem like an inevitability to me at this point, are only going to result in less sanitary conditions.

1938
03:01:43,497 --> 03:01:45,698
To me, all this is just a recipe for disaster.

1939
03:01:45,718 --> 03:01:52,423
It's my hope that the mayor will reconsider the wisdom of this grant and work with all of us to provide some answers to questions I think we all have.

1940
03:01:53,265 --> 03:01:56,806
I don't care how many cities and towns across the state have accepted this program.

1941
03:01:57,046 --> 03:01:58,566
We need to do what's best for Medford.

1942
03:01:58,946 --> 03:01:59,246
Thank you.

1943
03:02:03,787 --> 03:02:04,347
Thank you.

1944
03:02:12,629 --> 03:02:14,910
Ralph Klein, 172 Park Street in Medford.

1945
03:02:15,650 --> 03:02:19,450
I know most of this council won't remember the swill buckets used to have in your backyard.

1946
03:02:20,271 --> 03:02:22,011
You dump your compost, your

1947
03:02:22,462 --> 03:02:25,783
kitchen scraps, and once a week they'd come around and pick it up.

1948
03:02:25,803 --> 03:02:26,924
It was basically compost.

1949
03:02:27,044 --> 03:02:29,284
All your food waste went in this bin.

1950
03:02:29,324 --> 03:02:34,206
I don't think any of you, especially Councilor Sang, being the youngest, has ever seen one.

1951
03:02:35,747 --> 03:02:39,468
I believe the cover of the bucket my neighbor's got is still there.

1952
03:02:39,488 --> 03:02:40,828
I'll take a picture and give it to you.

1953
03:02:41,349 --> 03:02:44,150
You just step on it, pick it up, dump your garbage in.

1954
03:02:45,030 --> 03:02:48,631
And I can tell you from my childhood, Thursday was the worst day of the week.

1955
03:02:49,191 --> 03:02:51,152
The guy would come in, pull the metal bucket out,

1956
03:02:51,788 --> 03:02:53,589
went out to the swill truck and dump it.

1957
03:02:54,929 --> 03:03:00,072
And every Thursday, five or six hours, the stump stayed in the neighborhood.

1958
03:03:01,052 --> 03:03:03,713
So this composting in plastic bins, this was underground.

1959
03:03:03,733 --> 03:03:05,014
You only smelled it the one day.

1960
03:03:05,514 --> 03:03:08,135
This composting being outside is not a great idea.

1961
03:03:08,155 --> 03:03:12,397
In plastic bins, like they say, the rat population and all that.

1962
03:03:13,157 --> 03:03:19,240
Also reducing the trash pickup to twice a month as opposed to once a week.

1963
03:03:20,420 --> 03:03:21,481
I don't know if you people live with,

1964
03:03:22,361 --> 03:03:25,584
Amazon shoppers, but the cardboard increases 100%.

1965
03:03:27,225 --> 03:03:32,389
Even Sharp and Sharp, Peapod, drops off stuff in some of the cardboard boxes, not all in bags.

1966
03:03:33,049 --> 03:03:34,230
That creates more trash.

1967
03:03:35,411 --> 03:03:45,599
So, I mean, closing the stores is one thing, but you're increasing the trash when you do this Amazon shopping, Peapod, and like I say, the composting.

1968
03:03:46,319 --> 03:03:47,220
I still remember that.

1969
03:03:47,760 --> 03:03:50,002
I don't want the kids nowadays having to smell the swill truck.

1970
03:03:50,932 --> 03:03:52,333
I don't even think George remembers that.

1971
03:03:54,254 --> 03:03:57,316
I knew that.

1972
03:03:57,356 --> 03:03:59,657
That's why I said, you're young and the counselor sang.

1973
03:03:59,677 --> 03:04:00,338
Sorry about that.

1974
03:04:02,799 --> 03:04:06,181
George was on the school committee at age four or five, I think.

1975
03:04:08,122 --> 03:04:08,963
Judy Hauser.

1976
03:04:09,963 --> 03:04:12,445
And on one note, I'd like to propose to this council

1977
03:04:14,684 --> 03:04:16,145
Let's let Ralph have a speech.

1978
03:04:17,106 --> 03:04:18,207
I'm glad I could make you laugh.

1979
03:04:18,267 --> 03:04:21,309
I mean, usually I have you staring at me going, I'll get this guy out of here.

1980
03:04:21,929 --> 03:04:33,857
The other thing I'd like to propose to you guys is, you know, I know you have city council is usually once city council meetings once a month, maybe instead of this pointing back and forth through meetings, maybe sit down with the mayor, the whole council.

1981
03:04:34,357 --> 03:04:41,982
And if the hot point topic is the zoning and the planning commission, have them sit down once a month, the hot topic of the month.

1982
03:04:42,022 --> 03:04:43,683
If this is it, zoning's been going on for,

1983
03:04:44,410 --> 03:04:44,690
months.

1984
03:04:45,430 --> 03:04:48,171
And all we get is, this one's doing it wrong, that one's doing it wrong.

1985
03:04:48,831 --> 03:04:52,271
You guys can sit there, look across, and say, howdy, first thing.

1986
03:04:54,052 --> 03:04:56,372
Break the ice, do it face to face.

1987
03:04:57,412 --> 03:04:59,933
Instead of this, we get to the meetings and you're wasting your time.

1988
03:05:00,653 --> 03:05:05,134
It's been a week, a month, since this has started, the zoning thing.

1989
03:05:05,774 --> 03:05:07,054
You guys could sit there and talk.

1990
03:05:07,994 --> 03:05:11,775
I talked to you, I've spoken to all of you at some point.

1991
03:05:12,435 --> 03:05:13,375
If you guys can talk,

1992
03:05:14,570 --> 03:05:15,730
I mean, I may just laugh today.

1993
03:05:15,770 --> 03:05:18,791
Maybe we can make each other laugh and get some common ground.

1994
03:05:19,331 --> 03:05:23,892
Because the city's being held hostage, not you, not you, not the mayor.

1995
03:05:24,152 --> 03:05:26,113
The city's being held hostage by all this.

1996
03:05:26,993 --> 03:05:29,214
It's her, it's them, it's her, it's them.

1997
03:05:29,934 --> 03:05:33,515
Sit down, face to face, make a meeting so you're not just meeting with us.

1998
03:05:34,115 --> 03:05:34,875
You guys are button heads.

1999
03:05:35,255 --> 03:05:37,916
Do it in your private meetings and get it done.

2000
03:05:39,056 --> 03:05:39,396
Thank you.

2001
03:05:40,757 --> 03:05:41,257
Thank you, Ralph.

2002
03:05:42,720 --> 03:05:45,342
And I definitely appreciate the comment.

2003
03:05:45,762 --> 03:05:53,186
We aren't allowed, the seven of us, to meet with her in private because of the open meeting law, but the mayor is always welcome at our meetings.

2004
03:05:53,246 --> 03:06:03,833
We've had some really great, I mean, they've been difficult, but during budget hearings, the mayor has come down, we've worked things out directly, and I think that's been a productive approach.

2005
03:06:03,913 --> 03:06:08,615
So the mayor is invited to every council meeting to have those conversations with us.

2006
03:06:12,674 --> 03:06:15,075
We would welcome the mayor at any of our meetings.

2007
03:06:16,175 --> 03:06:17,635
Thank you.

2008
03:06:17,655 --> 03:06:17,815
Thanks.

2009
03:06:18,335 --> 03:06:21,976
Any further public comment by anyone who hasn't spoken yet on this matter?

2010
03:06:21,996 --> 03:06:25,517
All right.

2011
03:06:28,457 --> 03:06:28,717
Thanks.

2012
03:06:28,977 --> 03:06:29,958
Do you want three minutes or?

2013
03:06:29,978 --> 03:06:34,679
I shouldn't need more than three minutes.

2014
03:06:34,799 --> 03:06:36,359
I just didn't know if you wanted to.

2015
03:06:37,079 --> 03:06:38,960
That's the discretion of the president.

2016
03:06:38,980 --> 03:06:39,560
Go ahead.

2017
03:06:39,600 --> 03:06:40,240
You can answer.

2018
03:06:41,490 --> 03:06:41,770
Thank you.

2019
03:06:41,810 --> 03:06:45,573
I wasn't sure if you were coming from the public process or if you wanted me to finish that before you spoke.

2020
03:06:45,833 --> 03:06:47,594
However you, however you think.

2021
03:06:47,654 --> 03:06:49,975
Is there anyone else who hasn't spoken on this who'd like to speak?

2022
03:06:51,937 --> 03:06:55,159
Seeing none, is there anyone who's spoken on this who'd like to speak on it again for one more minute?

2023
03:06:55,979 --> 03:06:56,239
Great.

2024
03:06:56,599 --> 03:06:57,160
Sorry, Nina.

2025
03:06:59,862 --> 03:07:00,562
It's okay, I'll be fast.

2026
03:07:00,842 --> 03:07:02,963
Micah on Main Street.

2027
03:07:04,264 --> 03:07:09,868
I will give props to the mayor on one thing with this is that everyone in here

2028
03:07:10,838 --> 03:07:13,279
agrees how ridiculous this is.

2029
03:07:13,659 --> 03:07:19,620
She's brought together all of us, and half of this room does not usually agree with the other half of the room.

2030
03:07:19,820 --> 03:07:20,361
So good job.

2031
03:07:20,901 --> 03:07:22,121
That's a really good job that she did there.

2032
03:07:23,141 --> 03:07:23,882
Thank you for your comment.

2033
03:07:25,542 --> 03:07:34,144
It is very important that some things that were said here are just incorrect, which is understandable, because no information has been provided.

2034
03:07:34,204 --> 03:07:36,245
For example, composting isn't that stinky.

2035
03:07:36,305 --> 03:07:37,305
It's not that big of a deal.

2036
03:07:37,385 --> 03:07:39,126
It's actually fine.

2037
03:07:40,808 --> 03:07:51,330
you wouldn't know that if that wasn't something you were already engaged with because none of the preceding engagement that should have happened, happened with this.

2038
03:07:52,010 --> 03:07:56,611
So it really goes to show that like, yes, please engage with the residents.

2039
03:07:56,631 --> 03:07:56,852
Thank you.

2040
03:07:57,832 --> 03:07:58,592
Thank you for your comment.

2041
03:08:00,652 --> 03:08:02,913
Anyone else who's already spoken who'd like to go again?

2042
03:08:02,933 --> 03:08:06,474
All right, public comment on this paper is closed.

2043
03:08:06,854 --> 03:08:07,974
I'll recognize the chief of staff.

2044
03:08:13,206 --> 03:08:14,007
Thank you, Mr. President.

2045
03:08:14,847 --> 03:08:21,772
I think this is more for the public, is just some historical information, because I think the council has this information.

2046
03:08:23,233 --> 03:08:26,955
So I'm presenting to the council, so I'm going to present to the council.

2047
03:08:27,896 --> 03:08:32,439
As the council knows, the Solid Waste Task Force was launched in May of 2022.

2048
03:08:32,899 --> 03:08:42,586
Vice President Collins alluded to the task force and discussed it to a degree to help coordinate and plan Medford's priorities for the future of its waste management operations.

2049
03:08:43,306 --> 03:08:50,232
It was estimated at the time that continuing weekly trash collection would cost the city approximately $1 million per year.

2050
03:08:50,912 --> 03:08:55,516
And that would only increase over time, considering the increase in costs and inflation.

2051
03:08:58,658 --> 03:09:16,963
So, you know, frankly it just it presented affordability issues for the city and we know that one of our major drivers for our budget process that is one of our challenge points is between somewhere between pension because we're almost fully funded so we've got like I don't know I think it's

2052
03:09:18,463 --> 03:09:29,482
I don't know, seven years is coming to my mind, but I'm not doing the math right now in my head, to fully fund it and the escalation in costs as it pertains to waste and recycling.

2053
03:09:31,396 --> 03:09:39,104
The task force was in support of moving to collecting trash every other week, which allows the savings to be redirected to other services in the program.

2054
03:09:40,165 --> 03:09:49,055
Due to the escalating cost of trash disposal, this long-term strategy specifically minimizes trash disposal itself, which is the tonnage that we pay for,

2055
03:09:49,535 --> 03:09:51,756
We're paying for two things when we collect trash.

2056
03:09:51,776 --> 03:09:54,096
We're paying for the hauler to haul the trash.

2057
03:09:54,236 --> 03:09:56,737
Again, you all know this, but we're also paying for the tonnage.

2058
03:09:57,197 --> 03:10:14,101
And that tonnage, when you have food waste inside of the trash stream, gets really placed in a location where it doesn't need to get placed because some studies show that food waste tonnage equals approximately 48% of the trash.

2059
03:10:14,121 --> 03:10:14,761
And so going back,

2060
03:10:21,884 --> 03:10:38,599
The disposal cost for compost is really effectively little to none at all, and it allows the city to manage escalating trash disposal costs over a long-term contract and help keep our solid waste program within budget.

2061
03:10:39,380 --> 03:10:45,205
As the council knows, as is evidenced by the date of implementation that's being described,

2062
03:10:45,585 --> 03:10:49,006
Presently, July 1st, 2027 is the implementation date.

2063
03:10:49,166 --> 03:10:52,147
We're approximately 19 months out from the implementation date.

2064
03:10:52,187 --> 03:11:04,710
This is a slow rolling process presently to communicate what's to come, but this will all be done with a more comprehensive process.

2065
03:11:04,750 --> 03:11:06,090
This is the initial stages.

2066
03:11:06,150 --> 03:11:12,191
We haven't begun the significant communication that's gonna be needed with this type of thing.

2067
03:11:15,352 --> 03:11:15,415
you

2068
03:11:16,761 --> 03:11:29,344
presented, as you know, and the council referenced this, with this plan, which was based on the Solid Waste Task Force's input at its Committee of the Whole meeting on February 15th, 2023 and July 25th, 2023.

2069
03:11:29,624 --> 03:11:45,048
The council ultimately voted to approve the 10-year waste contract at its regular meeting, which was all under the umbrella of this contract effectively going to a biweekly trash collection.

2070
03:11:46,408 --> 03:11:51,609
The city held public workshops with the Solid Waste Task Force outlining the recommendations for every other week.

2071
03:11:52,729 --> 03:11:54,050
Trash in late 2022.

2072
03:11:54,210 --> 03:12:05,672
Again, I'm providing some of this information, so I don't think this historical public outreach is going to supplant the needed outreach in the future.

2073
03:12:05,812 --> 03:12:08,733
I'm just providing this as informational context for the public.

2074
03:12:11,493 --> 03:12:40,880
I could go into some depth about rodents and rats and the issues that Medford faces and how, in particular, the unsecured collection bins are the real challenge that we face that contain the food waste because those are the ones that are attracting rodents, which is different from the compost collection service because the composting bins are latched and they keep food waste secure so rodents can't access the food source.

2075
03:12:45,102 --> 03:12:51,346
The city's also done outreach on mitigating rodent activity and provided residents tips on how to help reduce activity.

2076
03:12:51,706 --> 03:12:55,968
The biggest driver of rodent activity is easily available food scraps.

2077
03:12:56,228 --> 03:13:04,433
You all know that, the members of the public who have been impacted by this, I'm sure know that and are working hard to mitigate those issues as well.

2078
03:13:05,440 --> 03:13:14,808
Again, the compost bins themselves are a part of that process to create reduction in rodents in the area as they can't access the food items to the containers.

2079
03:13:16,590 --> 03:13:23,696
There are regular meetings, internal meetings with regard to this contract as a whole.

2080
03:13:24,056 --> 03:13:30,902
And the reason I wanna bring this up is it's a very large contract that requires a significant amount of management.

2081
03:13:31,803 --> 03:13:32,363
And so our,

2082
03:13:33,584 --> 03:13:50,142
DPW Commissioner, our Director of Planning Development and Sustainability, and our Communications Director, as well as our consultant that worked with the City through the process of developing, drafting the RFP, negotiating the RFP.

2083
03:13:50,902 --> 03:13:55,006
zero strategy waste solutions meets regularly to manage the contract.

2084
03:13:55,066 --> 03:14:03,715
And I think that's just relevant in the grand scheme of things, but not necessarily specific to the points we've been discussing or that have been discussed here tonight.

2085
03:14:05,637 --> 03:14:13,764
Also, as you know, loose trash bags are no longer lining the sidewalks of our squares ahead of trash pickup, which is certainly a good thing.

2086
03:14:15,786 --> 03:14:24,933
You know, in all reality, and this is to the Council, if the Council would like to revert plans to go to weekly trash collection, the Mayor is willing to discuss to figure out how we would handle the added cost increase.

2087
03:14:26,335 --> 03:14:31,719
Realistically, this is the beginning of a process to roll out communications on this topic.

2088
03:14:32,539 --> 03:14:40,663
PDS did have a—the Planning, Development, and Sustainability did have an information session at its open house event yesterday evening about composting and the new program.

2089
03:14:40,703 --> 03:14:43,164
I believe a resident spoke about that.

2090
03:14:44,824 --> 03:14:54,048
We're developing the comprehensive communications plan that will be rolled out over the course of the next several months, aligning the program, the reasoning for the implementation, and the impact on our trash collection strategy.

2091
03:14:54,688 --> 03:15:02,111
We will be holding public information sessions to hear directly from residents on what challenges they foresee will arise by this change in collection.

2092
03:15:02,731 --> 03:15:07,193
Again, if the council wants to take a vote at some point to change course, just let us know.

2093
03:15:08,173 --> 03:15:08,393
Thank you.

2094
03:15:10,310 --> 03:15:11,351
I just want to be clear.

2095
03:15:11,391 --> 03:15:13,231
We can't take a vote to change course.

2096
03:15:13,591 --> 03:15:15,552
The mayor administers the contracts for the city.

2097
03:15:16,152 --> 03:15:20,993
So if the mayor wants to change course, we're happy to have that proposal discussed before us.

2098
03:15:22,174 --> 03:15:24,514
But we'd never voted to adopt a contract.

2099
03:15:24,574 --> 03:15:26,035
We never negotiated a contract.

2100
03:15:26,055 --> 03:15:27,135
We never signed a contract.

2101
03:15:27,615 --> 03:15:31,476
We authorized the administration to enter into a contract greater than three years.

2102
03:15:32,117 --> 03:15:36,758
We had meetings three years ago and two years ago where we heard

2103
03:15:37,858 --> 03:15:44,842
what the general outlines of the contract would be and that at some point in the contract, there would be an option to go to every other week trash service.

2104
03:15:45,483 --> 03:15:54,708
And then we were told that the city would tell us when we were meeting goals and felt that they had the plan to move forward with that.

2105
03:15:56,994 --> 03:16:04,078
I'm just as the leader of this council, you're not gonna say, oh, if the council wants to vote, we can't vote to do this.

2106
03:16:04,298 --> 03:16:06,079
Only the mayor can decide to do this.

2107
03:16:06,679 --> 03:16:15,944
So if the mayor, I appreciate a lot of what you just said, basically most of what you just said until the sentence where you said, if you guys wanna do it, feel free, we can't.

2108
03:16:16,824 --> 03:16:23,108
So we could take a vote tonight and say, no more, trash every week forever.

2109
03:16:23,128 --> 03:16:25,149
It would have no force and effect.

2110
03:16:26,271 --> 03:16:32,035
zero force and effect because we don't sign, negotiate, administer contracts on behalf of the city.

2111
03:16:32,075 --> 03:16:33,396
The city's chief executive does that.

2112
03:16:34,776 --> 03:16:41,320
I think you heard from a lot of us tonight that we wanted to hear about the communications plan.

2113
03:16:41,361 --> 03:16:42,861
We wanted to hear about the rollout.

2114
03:16:43,282 --> 03:16:46,604
We wanted to hear about the goals that we were meeting to get there.

2115
03:16:47,124 --> 03:16:53,108
You know, I have had conversations with planning development, sustainability staff, with DPW staff,

2116
03:16:53,772 --> 03:16:56,114
talking about, you know, composting is getting better.

2117
03:16:56,194 --> 03:16:59,336
We're at 30, I think we're at 35% now, or maybe it's higher than that.

2118
03:16:59,356 --> 03:17:02,918
I'm not sure because the report hasn't been presented.

2119
03:17:02,938 --> 03:17:12,524
I think the issue we have here tonight is we were told a couple years ago that the administration was going to come back and talk about what their plan was to roll this out.

2120
03:17:13,344 --> 03:17:15,766
And instead what happened is a press release went out

2121
03:17:16,351 --> 03:17:18,633
And in paragraph 11, it said, we're doing this in July 2027.

2122
03:17:18,673 --> 03:17:22,717
And it didn't say, here's the upcoming public forum.

2123
03:17:23,197 --> 03:17:25,639
Here's the place that you can have a conversation about it.

2124
03:17:26,220 --> 03:17:34,147
If I can remember, I don't even know that the press release mentioned that there was a PDS open house the next business day after the press release went out.

2125
03:17:35,228 --> 03:17:41,414
And I think there are very clear and simple things that could have been done differently.

2126
03:17:42,385 --> 03:17:51,075
even just changing the timing of the press release, changing the rollout, making it clear to residents, we know you're going to be concerned about this.

2127
03:17:51,095 --> 03:17:57,582
This is a major change to the main way that you interact with your city on a weekly basis, and here are the ways that you can engage with that.

2128
03:17:58,163 --> 03:18:00,065
And we haven't decided, oh, July 2027, it's happening.

2129
03:18:01,647 --> 03:18:03,728
We said, we're gonna have six months of meetings.

2130
03:18:04,248 --> 03:18:05,808
Our intent right now is to do this in July, 2027.

2131
03:18:05,888 --> 03:18:11,931
We think that's what we need from a cost basis perspective, and we'll go and do that another time.

2132
03:18:12,431 --> 03:18:13,291
But none of that happened.

2133
03:18:13,511 --> 03:18:17,633
It was paragraph 10, or Cheryl said 11, of a press release.

2134
03:18:18,313 --> 03:18:20,293
And the headline of the press release was, City Gets Grant.

2135
03:18:21,954 --> 03:18:23,014
It just seems backwards.

2136
03:18:24,515 --> 03:18:26,356
And I think it really undermines our goals.

2137
03:18:26,836 --> 03:18:29,597
So that's my deepest concern here.

2138
03:18:31,937 --> 03:18:36,380
It's, you know, you're at the line in the race.

2139
03:18:37,181 --> 03:18:39,963
You're like, we have a very ambitious goal that we wanna achieve.

2140
03:18:40,083 --> 03:18:46,408
It's gonna take talking to thousands of people and essentially trying to get thousands of households to change how they behave.

2141
03:18:47,409 --> 03:18:50,371
And like first step out of the gate, we fall.

2142
03:18:51,532 --> 03:18:52,593
And that's what worries me.

2143
03:18:54,729 --> 03:19:05,918
And I think like it means that maybe the city budget gets impacted because maybe people don't want to adopt this goal now because a bunch of people who maybe could have been open to the idea of it are now reflexively opposed to it.

2144
03:19:07,520 --> 03:19:10,442
I myself kind of fall into that bucket, right?

2145
03:19:10,562 --> 03:19:14,465
Like I'm not saying out of like on principle, I'm against this no matter what.

2146
03:19:14,505 --> 03:19:15,926
There are people who feel that way.

2147
03:19:16,066 --> 03:19:16,967
It must be every week.

2148
03:19:17,107 --> 03:19:21,931
And I want to listen to them too, but it just feels like,

2149
03:19:24,176 --> 03:19:25,256
the rollout was botched.

2150
03:19:25,896 --> 03:19:37,360
And that the first time we really were talking about it, at least the first time in the past two years, since we had some meetings several years ago where it was like, this might be an option, people felt like they were getting two-stepped on it.

2151
03:19:39,440 --> 03:19:40,621
So that's just where I'm coming from.

2152
03:19:41,201 --> 03:19:42,201
Vice President Collins.

2153
03:19:45,282 --> 03:19:45,462
Sure.

2154
03:19:45,482 --> 03:19:45,942
Thank you, President.

2155
03:19:46,982 --> 03:19:49,003
Sorry, Vice President Collins, one second.

2156
03:19:49,183 --> 03:19:49,483
What's up?

2157
03:19:50,210 --> 03:20:00,479
I just wanted to comment that the council does all the time take votes that it would like to see.

2158
03:20:00,819 --> 03:20:02,661
This resolution itself is an example.

2159
03:20:03,441 --> 03:20:13,950
That is an opening from the mayor to this council to say, if this council would like to revisit the idea to go away from biweekly collection, that she is open to it.

2160
03:20:14,010 --> 03:20:15,892
That is what I was trying to communicate.

2161
03:20:16,052 --> 03:20:16,352
OK.

2162
03:20:16,452 --> 03:20:17,233
I appreciate that.

2163
03:20:17,353 --> 03:20:18,214
I think what I'm saying is,

2164
03:20:19,847 --> 03:20:25,629
you know, if folks are, you know, I want you guys to put out your plan for how you're gonna communicate this.

2165
03:20:26,269 --> 03:20:28,010
I want residents to talk to you about it.

2166
03:20:28,410 --> 03:20:34,672
And if the mayor feels like she needs to revisit her decision, we're happy to have her put a paper on our agenda to talk about that.

2167
03:20:36,193 --> 03:20:37,073
It's my perspective.

2168
03:20:37,113 --> 03:20:39,294
I don't know if other councilors have other perspectives on that.

2169
03:20:39,894 --> 03:20:43,816
Vice President Collins, then Councilor Lemming, then Councilor Callahan.

2170
03:20:45,737 --> 03:20:46,617
Thank you, President Behrs.

2171
03:20:48,078 --> 03:21:00,333
I want to be brief, but I do just want to be clear as a member of the former task force the solid waste task force that this isn't how any of us said to roll this out and this isn't how we understood that it would be rolled out when the task force was convening.

2172
03:21:01,088 --> 03:21:03,009
In 2022, we were talking about goals.

2173
03:21:03,210 --> 03:21:09,654
We were talking about the goals that we all share for reducing waste, becoming more sustainable, reducing our carbon emissions through waste.

2174
03:21:10,135 --> 03:21:21,803
We worked with the resources that the mayor allocated to us, reviewing best practices from other cities, and we came to form some recommendations about what of those options seemed most interesting and valuable to us for Medford.

2175
03:21:21,823 --> 03:21:26,747
We were talking about options for manifesting these values in our waste pickup, in our community.

2176
03:21:27,713 --> 03:21:34,600
But the task force was a volunteer advisory non-binding group of community members eager to serve, many of them passionate about the environment.

2177
03:21:35,501 --> 03:21:42,148
And it just really rubs me the wrong way to see the city administration laying the blame for a poorly rolled out process.

2178
03:21:43,059 --> 03:21:47,821
at the feet of a volunteer body that was producing non-binding recommendations.

2179
03:21:48,041 --> 03:22:02,086
It's up to the duly elected and appointed leaders of the city, not volunteer members of a community task force to look into feasibility, make those real world decisions about what is feasible and when, and to design a communication strategy and to fund it to be successful.

2180
03:22:02,106 --> 03:22:08,168
And it just felt really important to me to put that out there because I saw members of the former task force on this meeting tonight.

2181
03:22:08,248 --> 03:22:09,729
I know they've been engaging in this process

2182
03:22:10,589 --> 03:22:20,176
And it just really upsets me to see people's volunteerism for their community be politicized.

2183
03:22:20,196 --> 03:22:21,437
Thank you.

2184
03:22:23,578 --> 03:22:24,519
Councilor Lemming.

2185
03:22:24,539 --> 03:22:29,362
Yeah, I mean, it was a poorly written press release.

2186
03:22:29,462 --> 03:22:33,785
It was ill-advised to put that out.

2187
03:22:35,726 --> 03:22:38,548
Clearly it ticked everybody in the community off.

2188
03:22:42,462 --> 03:22:54,125
Trying to say that it's somehow the council's responsibility that fits into a pattern of behavior of whenever the administration messes up.

2189
03:22:54,185 --> 03:23:02,488
There's this effort to pass the buck around, which it's a game that I'm getting kind of tired of.

2190
03:23:03,788 --> 03:23:09,070
If the mayor had followed that press release up and just saying that, look,

2191
03:23:10,861 --> 03:23:16,704
We're sorry, this is a poor way to roll this out.

2192
03:23:17,904 --> 03:23:20,586
This is our actual communications plan.

2193
03:23:21,026 --> 03:23:22,607
That would have been fine.

2194
03:23:22,627 --> 03:23:29,290
I just wanna see the act of taking responsibility for something here.

2195
03:23:30,890 --> 03:23:36,132
And this was very clearly, if anything, just a communications mess up.

2196
03:23:36,992 --> 03:23:42,014
And the trash contracts are the mayor's responsibility.

2197
03:23:42,134 --> 03:23:48,196
These negotiating and fixing these contracts is up to the mayor.

2198
03:23:49,077 --> 03:23:49,817
End of story.

2199
03:23:50,297 --> 03:23:51,377
It's not up to this council.

2200
03:23:51,397 --> 03:23:57,559
It is not up to a volunteer task force that's giving recommendations.

2201
03:23:57,660 --> 03:23:58,920
It is up to the mayor.

2202
03:23:59,800 --> 03:24:10,689
and they released a press release that conveyed information very poorly.

2203
03:24:10,709 --> 03:24:21,677
And yeah, I would just like to see a stop this pattern of trying to pass the buck off and blame somebody else for your problems.

2204
03:24:24,519 --> 03:24:25,380
Councilor Callahan.

2205
03:24:27,763 --> 03:24:35,349
So I think the people of Medford elected a mayor, and the people of Medford elected a city council.

2206
03:24:36,270 --> 03:24:40,834
And I think they elected the mayor to do the mayor's job, and the city council to do the city council's job.

2207
03:24:41,254 --> 03:24:49,181
And I would really appreciate it if the mayor would do the mayor's job, which is taking care of the trash, taking care of the roads.

2208
03:24:50,482 --> 03:24:52,503
There's so many things that the mayor is supposed to do.

2209
03:24:52,523 --> 03:24:53,304
This is one of them.

2210
03:24:53,424 --> 03:25:07,531
And for the mayor to come here, and in the same day, request that she gets to control zoning, and tell us exactly how we're going to do it, and tell us that we have to change this one corner, and it has to be this other, instead of MX2, it has to be MX1.

2211
03:25:07,952 --> 03:25:09,492
And then we have to redo Mystic Ave.

2212
03:25:09,532 --> 03:25:16,236
And we have to, you know, like the number of things she wants to control in the zoning, which is not her job.

2213
03:25:17,957 --> 03:25:19,438
She should be a little busier.

2214
03:25:20,372 --> 03:25:31,120
figuring out how to do the trash and the compost and not come here and tell us that we have to make a motion to fix the botched job that she just did.

2215
03:25:31,740 --> 03:25:35,263
So please, if the mayor can do the mayor's job, we will do our job.

2216
03:25:37,701 --> 03:25:38,201
Thank you.

2217
03:25:38,261 --> 03:25:39,001
Councilor Sang.

2218
03:25:39,762 --> 03:25:54,947
I'm just going to be really quick because I, you already covered it President Behrs, but I find it extremely frustrating when the record about what this council heard and voted on years ago, back in 2023 is misleading.

2219
03:25:55,588 --> 03:26:03,691
I, it's not, we voted to, as you said, let the mayor enter into the contract negotiations for contracts more than three years.

2220
03:26:04,091 --> 03:26:04,691
That was the vote.

2221
03:26:05,131 --> 03:26:08,452
It wasn't on the substance that we're seeing and talking about here tonight.

2222
03:26:10,073 --> 03:26:21,877
This, as Councilor Lemming mentioned, this effort to pass the buck to a non-binding volunteer task force isn't accepting responsibility.

2223
03:26:22,017 --> 03:26:32,260
And I just find this practice of trying to point fingers instead of coming to the table and just having a vivid conversation about how we want to

2224
03:26:32,990 --> 03:26:36,211
continue our trash program and restructure it and pay for it.

2225
03:26:37,472 --> 03:26:38,472
It's just frustrating to me.

2226
03:26:42,194 --> 03:26:42,754
Thank you.

2227
03:26:42,774 --> 03:26:53,078
We do have a motion by Councilor Callahan, seconded by.

2228
03:26:53,158 --> 03:26:54,138
One second, thank you.

2229
03:26:55,179 --> 03:26:57,259
Motion by Councilor Callahan, seconded by.

2230
03:27:00,121 --> 03:27:01,201
It's the paper that we're

2231
03:27:02,585 --> 03:27:06,950
It's the resolution and as amended by Councilor Sang and Councilor Scarpelli.

2232
03:27:06,970 --> 03:27:12,316
So we have the original paper as amended with Councilor Scarpelli's points and Councilor Sang's points.

2233
03:27:12,336 --> 03:27:13,437
All right.

2234
03:27:14,258 --> 03:27:16,480
Is there any further discussion by members of the Council on the motion?

2235
03:27:17,982 --> 03:27:19,023
Seeing none, Madam Chief of Staff.

2236
03:27:22,745 --> 03:27:23,586
Thank you, President Behrs.

2237
03:27:24,346 --> 03:27:41,318
Look, I would like to get to a place where all of us do what you just described, Councilor, saying, because I don't think, it's very difficult for me to hear some of the comments that are made at city council meetings and not come back and rebut them.

2238
03:27:41,978 --> 03:27:46,682
because I think some things are just absolutely wild sometimes.

2239
03:27:46,702 --> 03:27:56,851
I mean, your recent comments, not your comments specifically, but your comments, Councilor Sang, I think you're unaware of some of the things that were stated back in 2023.

2240
03:27:56,931 --> 03:27:59,212
Please direct your comments to the Chair, thank you.

2241
03:27:59,273 --> 03:28:00,954
Yes, thank you, President Behrs, for the reminder.

2242
03:28:03,704 --> 03:28:16,858
I think Councilor Sang is unaware of some of the comments that were presented back in 2023 when the Council received these recommendations from the task force, and I appreciate

2243
03:28:19,060 --> 03:28:22,981
I've worked alongside a lot of volunteers in my career, and I greatly appreciate them.

2244
03:28:23,942 --> 03:28:30,284
So, you know, again, people can put words in my mouth, people can put words in the mayor's mouth, but look, this is a two-way street.

2245
03:28:30,404 --> 03:28:34,765
If we want to work together, President Behrs and council members, let's work together.

2246
03:28:35,305 --> 03:28:43,268
If we want to continue to lop things at each other, then, you know, I'm, you know,

2247
03:28:44,426 --> 03:28:50,572
And I don't think the mayor, and I wanna speak for the mayor, I don't think we're gonna sit quietly and just allow that to occur at city council meetings.

2248
03:28:51,313 --> 03:29:05,246
I've got a list of things Councilor Collins stated back in 2023 about how effectively excited, that's my characterization, not hers necessarily, she was about this contract.

2249
03:29:05,306 --> 03:29:09,209
And while certainly the council did not vote on a motion

2250
03:29:10,010 --> 03:29:21,673
on the specifics of this contract, the fact of the matter is there was a July 25th, 2023 meeting where an hour was spent on discussing the contents of that contract, which included bi-weekly.

2251
03:29:21,833 --> 03:29:32,655
I have seven copies of the slides that were mentioned that were received by the council at the time that specifically state that we're talking about every other week trash collection.

2252
03:29:33,095 --> 03:29:36,976
I can happily distribute that, but to suggest that

2253
03:29:38,236 --> 03:29:42,959
These things weren't necessarily things that were discussed back then, or the Council had no purview.

2254
03:29:43,339 --> 03:29:53,424
The Council almost always has requested Committee of the Whole meetings in anticipation of large votes, such as extending a 10-year contract.

2255
03:29:53,844 --> 03:29:54,885
The Council could have

2256
03:29:56,513 --> 03:30:06,559
theoretically voted no on a 10-year extension on the heels of the one-hour long discussion when it was specifically discussed that trash pickup would be every other week.

2257
03:30:07,460 --> 03:30:08,040
So thank you.

2258
03:30:10,922 --> 03:30:21,328
I'm gonna recognize Councilor Sang, but I don't think, right, this is what people don't want.

2259
03:30:23,786 --> 03:30:27,748
We raise our concerns and it's, you know, guess we're not going to sit idly by.

2260
03:30:29,008 --> 03:30:31,589
Once more under the breach, the cannons fire.

2261
03:30:32,729 --> 03:30:36,611
Um, we're going to start quoting people from meetings years ago.

2262
03:30:37,291 --> 03:30:38,952
If we want to talk about that meeting, right.

2263
03:30:39,052 --> 03:30:42,973
It was, uh, there's an option in the contract to go to every other week.

2264
03:30:43,013 --> 03:30:45,134
And here's all the things we're going to do to make that a reality.

2265
03:30:45,514 --> 03:30:46,415
And here we are today.

2266
03:30:47,115 --> 03:30:48,015
Those things weren't done.

2267
03:30:48,636 --> 03:30:50,876
And it feels like it's not going to be able to be made reality.

2268
03:30:51,837 --> 03:30:51,937
Um,

2269
03:30:54,712 --> 03:31:00,817
I think the really hard thing I have here is, right, like, no one talked to the city council about putting out a press release, and now it's our fault?

2270
03:31:02,939 --> 03:31:03,419
You wrote it.

2271
03:31:03,579 --> 03:31:03,819
Own it.

2272
03:31:04,440 --> 03:31:04,800
You wrote it.

2273
03:31:04,900 --> 03:31:05,140
Own it.

2274
03:31:06,341 --> 03:31:11,285
If you want to include us, as we've been asked to be included, we can't even get our stuff posted on the city website.

2275
03:31:11,706 --> 03:31:16,810
The mayor won't send out city council newsletters using the city newsletter list because it's her list.

2276
03:31:17,955 --> 03:31:21,097
So no, I'm not gonna be accountable for your press releases.

2277
03:31:21,357 --> 03:31:24,218
And this council is not gonna be accountable for your press releases.

2278
03:31:24,258 --> 03:31:25,239
It's not gonna happen.

2279
03:31:26,540 --> 03:31:29,381
We're not covering for other people's mistakes.

2280
03:31:30,382 --> 03:31:31,963
Don't put it in paragraph 10.

2281
03:31:32,483 --> 03:31:32,903
That's it.

2282
03:31:33,884 --> 03:31:34,944
Say what you're doing.

2283
03:31:35,424 --> 03:31:37,205
We're going to every other week trash.

2284
03:31:37,646 --> 03:31:38,846
Say it six months ago.

2285
03:31:39,547 --> 03:31:41,768
Say it and say there's a public forum.

2286
03:31:41,808 --> 03:31:45,630
There's three public forums over the next few months where we're gonna talk about how to make it work.

2287
03:31:46,170 --> 03:31:47,591
Don't spin it.

2288
03:31:48,865 --> 03:31:50,626
in a press release that says big grant.

2289
03:31:50,706 --> 03:31:51,986
We got a grant 200,000.

2290
03:31:52,206 --> 03:31:54,367
Also, you're losing a week of trash.

2291
03:31:56,268 --> 03:31:57,308
I didn't write that press release.

2292
03:31:57,408 --> 03:31:59,049
So I'm happy to collaborate.

2293
03:31:59,069 --> 03:32:03,470
If you want to collaborate on every press release that goes out, we'll vote on every one before it goes out.

2294
03:32:04,250 --> 03:32:04,951
I'm here for it.

2295
03:32:05,771 --> 03:32:07,592
Sadly, that's not what the city charter says.

2296
03:32:08,492 --> 03:32:09,792
Strong mayor, weak council.

2297
03:32:10,833 --> 03:32:11,093
Own it.

2298
03:32:11,773 --> 03:32:12,413
Councilor Sang.

2299
03:32:13,674 --> 03:32:16,755
Yeah, I just don't want this to get into a back and forth, but I,

2300
03:32:18,317 --> 03:32:25,135
I just wanted to put on the record that I find a lot of what was said personally offensive and patronizing.

2301
03:32:27,570 --> 03:32:34,332
I think that in the characterizations of those meetings, and we did talk about this, I even acknowledge that we talked about this.

2302
03:32:36,012 --> 03:32:40,933
In my first remarks on this, you expounded on those conversations just now.

2303
03:32:41,733 --> 03:32:48,915
What's conveniently left out is that we were also told at the same time that we would evaluate if the city was ready for this after an outreach process.

2304
03:32:50,016 --> 03:32:54,777
And we would make plans for alternative paths, including weekly cash pickup.

2305
03:32:56,582 --> 03:33:02,847
And that was part of the conversation before we took a vote on authorizing the mayor to negotiate the contract.

2306
03:33:02,867 --> 03:33:06,090
I just want to set the record straight on that.

2307
03:33:06,971 --> 03:33:07,791
Thank you, Councilor Sang.

2308
03:33:07,872 --> 03:33:08,732
Vice President Collins?

2309
03:33:12,836 --> 03:33:15,938
Thank you, President Behrs, and I'll make this quick.

2310
03:33:18,054 --> 03:33:20,275
because I think we've said all we need to say here.

2311
03:33:20,295 --> 03:33:29,317
And I think the bottom line is it's important that the community know what the levers are and where the jurisdiction lies with this policy.

2312
03:33:29,357 --> 03:33:33,618
And I think at least in this meeting, we've done what we can to advance correct information.

2313
03:33:35,058 --> 03:33:40,780
But to the point that was recently made, yeah, I think that characterization is just fine.

2314
03:33:40,880 --> 03:33:42,920
I was excited in the meeting two years ago.

2315
03:33:43,000 --> 03:33:46,601
I'm glad that such scrupulous notes were being taken about my mood.

2316
03:33:47,768 --> 03:33:50,871
I was excited about the specter of this policy being done right.

2317
03:33:51,832 --> 03:33:54,134
I wasn't lying when I said I was excited about waste reduction.

2318
03:33:54,334 --> 03:33:54,955
I ran on that.

2319
03:33:55,015 --> 03:33:55,715
It's important to me.

2320
03:33:55,736 --> 03:33:57,717
It's important to a lot of people in Medford.

2321
03:33:57,757 --> 03:33:58,978
This is something that we share.

2322
03:33:59,038 --> 03:34:00,199
This is a shared value.

2323
03:34:00,740 --> 03:34:04,043
Environmentalism, waste reduction, carbon emission reduction.

2324
03:34:05,684 --> 03:34:07,146
I'm not opposed to the policy.

2325
03:34:08,206 --> 03:34:10,769
I'm opposed to the avoidant, backhanded,

2326
03:34:11,435 --> 03:34:19,418
unaccountable, untransparent way that it's being rolled out that is spoiling our chances for this going forward productively, which I think is really important.

2327
03:34:19,859 --> 03:34:23,320
I care about the process because I want this outcome to be successful.

2328
03:34:24,261 --> 03:34:24,941
I already said that.

2329
03:34:25,721 --> 03:34:26,782
I said that 20 minutes ago.

2330
03:34:27,322 --> 03:34:28,382
I said it two years ago.

2331
03:34:32,824 --> 03:34:34,985
We need the administration to step up and do this right.

2332
03:34:35,825 --> 03:34:36,866
And that's what we're asking for.

2333
03:34:43,788 --> 03:34:52,254
On the motion of Councilor Kellyanne, seconded by Councilor Lazaro, as amended by Councilor Skarpelian-Seng.

2334
03:34:54,455 --> 03:34:58,178
Do we want to amend it to just, we can apparently vote to just end it right now if we want.

2335
03:35:02,401 --> 03:35:05,863
Sorry, I had no idea that we were the mayor.

2336
03:35:07,624 --> 03:35:08,645
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2337
03:35:10,626 --> 03:35:11,587
Councilor Kellyanne.

2338
03:35:12,838 --> 03:35:13,878
Vice President Collins.

2339
03:35:14,279 --> 03:35:14,499
Yes.

2340
03:35:16,119 --> 03:35:17,040
Councilor Zaro.

2341
03:35:18,300 --> 03:35:19,001
Councilor Lemming.

2342
03:35:20,121 --> 03:35:21,022
Councilor Scarpelli.

2343
03:35:21,902 --> 03:35:22,642
Councilor Singh.

2344
03:35:23,563 --> 03:35:24,223
President Behrs.

2345
03:35:25,003 --> 03:35:26,684
Yes, I have an affirmative, none of the negative.

2346
03:35:26,724 --> 03:35:27,665
The motion passes.

2347
03:35:27,765 --> 03:35:28,625
Councilor Callahan.

2348
03:35:29,465 --> 03:35:32,467
I would like to pull item 25-124 from the table.

2349
03:35:34,007 --> 03:35:40,910
On the motion by Councilor Callahan to take paper 25-124 off the table, seconded by, seconded by Councilor Lemming.

2350
03:35:41,091 --> 03:35:42,031
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2351
03:35:47,378 --> 03:35:48,199
Councilor Kelly?

2352
03:35:48,339 --> 03:35:48,539
Yes.

2353
03:35:49,821 --> 03:35:50,942
Vice President Collins?

2354
03:35:51,583 --> 03:35:51,823
Yes.

2355
03:35:53,184 --> 03:35:53,965
Councilor Zaro?

2356
03:35:53,985 --> 03:35:54,045
Yes.

2357
03:35:55,207 --> 03:35:55,887
Councilor Lemming?

2358
03:35:55,907 --> 03:35:57,009
Yes.

2359
03:35:57,029 --> 03:35:57,930
Councilor Scarpelli?

2360
03:35:57,970 --> 03:35:58,030
Yes.

2361
03:35:59,952 --> 03:36:00,873
Councilor Singh?

2362
03:36:02,835 --> 03:36:02,975
Yes.

2363
03:36:05,280 --> 03:36:07,382
Yes, 70 affirmative and a negative.

2364
03:36:07,482 --> 03:36:08,282
The motion passes.

2365
03:36:08,923 --> 03:36:12,446
Paper 25124, tree committee ordinance.

2366
03:36:12,766 --> 03:36:15,869
And there's an amended copy of the tree committee ordinance at the back of our packets.

2367
03:36:16,469 --> 03:36:17,190
Councilor Callahan.

2368
03:36:19,133 --> 03:36:20,074
Thank you.

2369
03:36:21,075 --> 03:36:22,916
So this is our third meeting.

2370
03:36:23,136 --> 03:36:24,478
It has been here before.

2371
03:36:24,498 --> 03:36:35,067
It has since gone through just a little bit of legal review as well as some tiny revisions from the DPW commissioner.

2372
03:36:35,947 --> 03:36:37,268
I think this is in really good shape.

2373
03:36:38,008 --> 03:37:02,936
Again, this basically sets up a tree committee for the city of Medford, where volunteers will be able to serve on that committee, and it will essentially assist the tree warden and the DPW with things like educating the public, helping with tree hearings, you know, reviewing and reporting on annual report of tree planting and promoting materials.

2374
03:37:05,950 --> 03:37:08,533
and assisting the tree warden with the duties.

2375
03:37:08,774 --> 03:37:12,758
And so I'm very excited for this to get passed.

2376
03:37:18,357 --> 03:37:21,978
I just want to thank Councillor Callaghan on her really hard work on this ordinance.

2377
03:37:22,299 --> 03:37:31,882
This is something that I had before me years ago during my first term, and it's been really challenging to get it out of the council.

2378
03:37:31,983 --> 03:37:36,644
And it's a real testament to Councillor Callaghan that she's been able to get this component done.

2379
03:37:36,664 --> 03:37:45,348
I know trees is something that's important to our community and to equity and to us and to climate, but I also know it's a really

2380
03:37:45,888 --> 03:37:48,589
deeply important issue to Councilor Callahan as well.

2381
03:37:49,510 --> 03:37:51,010
So I just really want to celebrate this.

2382
03:37:51,290 --> 03:37:53,571
I'm very happy to second the motion.

2383
03:37:55,112 --> 03:38:03,455
This is a huge step forward, and especially when we think about development, zoning in the city, this is the type of stuff we need to go along with that at work.

2384
03:38:05,856 --> 03:38:11,999
On the motion by Councilor Callahan to approve for first reading, seconded by Councilor Sang, Councilor Lazaro.

2385
03:38:13,620 --> 03:38:14,220
This is

2386
03:38:18,615 --> 03:38:19,495
This is first reading.

2387
03:38:22,137 --> 03:38:22,297
It is.

2388
03:38:22,317 --> 03:38:23,397
It hasn't been advertised yet.

2389
03:38:26,219 --> 03:38:26,759
It's first reading.

2390
03:38:27,660 --> 03:38:31,942
It was tabled in council, but it was never approved for first reading.

2391
03:38:32,282 --> 03:38:33,563
So this is an approval for first reading.

2392
03:38:33,643 --> 03:38:33,983
Sorry.

2393
03:38:38,865 --> 03:38:42,927
Well, you could move to waive the three weeks if it requires unanimous consent.

2394
03:38:45,468 --> 03:38:46,209
Seriously or not?

2395
03:38:48,098 --> 03:38:51,119
Do you want to waive the three readings and approve and ordain?

2396
03:38:51,139 --> 03:38:53,040
All right.

2397
03:38:53,960 --> 03:39:02,083
On the motion by Councilor Callahan to waive the three readings and approve, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Lozaro.

2398
03:39:04,944 --> 03:39:07,605
I was just going to, I was going to second.

2399
03:39:07,865 --> 03:39:09,486
I didn't realize Councilor Sangam was seconding.

2400
03:39:10,266 --> 03:39:12,847
I appreciate all of Councilor Callahan's work as well.

2401
03:39:13,748 --> 03:39:15,469
She's the Lorax, she speaks for the trees.

2402
03:39:18,010 --> 03:39:19,810
I would support waiving the three readings too.

2403
03:39:19,850 --> 03:39:23,311
I think there's been extensive work done on this, really collaborative.

2404
03:39:24,412 --> 03:39:26,893
I don't think we need to do the full process and I would support that.

2405
03:39:26,913 --> 03:39:28,613
This has gone through a lot of revisions.

2406
03:39:28,673 --> 03:39:31,154
Quite a lot of revision and time, yes.

2407
03:39:32,295 --> 03:39:33,275
Councilor Callahan.

2408
03:39:35,766 --> 03:39:45,928
I do want to make sure to thank Therese Medford, which worked incredibly hard on this and the other two tree ordinances that we will see later.

2409
03:39:46,729 --> 03:39:50,310
I also want to thank Councilor Collins, who worked on this.

2410
03:39:50,770 --> 03:39:55,831
Am I correct in saying that Councilor Morrell also worked on this previously?

2411
03:39:56,231 --> 03:39:59,912
So I really appreciate all the work of many, many years.

2412
03:40:00,752 --> 03:40:06,836
Councilor Behrs, I want to thank everyone who worked on this, and especially Trees Medford.

2413
03:40:06,876 --> 03:40:14,962
They have been absolutely vital, not only in this and the other tree ordinances, but in protecting our tree canopy here in Medford.

2414
03:40:15,502 --> 03:40:23,608
Yeah, and I think it goes without saying that this went through councilors over like three councils, so definitely

2415
03:40:24,343 --> 03:40:31,705
former Council President Morrell, Councillors who served with us in the 2020 to 2022 term as well.

2416
03:40:33,845 --> 03:40:34,206
All right.

2417
03:40:34,866 --> 03:40:43,068
On the motion by Councillor Callahan to approve, to ordain, waive the three readings and ordain, seconded by Councillor Scarpelli.

2418
03:40:44,088 --> 03:40:45,248
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2419
03:40:46,929 --> 03:40:48,089
Is there any public comment on this?

2420
03:40:48,849 --> 03:40:49,930
No one has raised their hand on Zoom.

2421
03:40:50,170 --> 03:40:51,150
Anyone in the chamber?

2422
03:40:52,430 --> 03:40:55,371
Julia, you're a champ for coming to this for one thing and sticking it out to the end.

2423
03:40:56,911 --> 03:40:58,391
Oh, Micah.

2424
03:41:00,512 --> 03:41:02,072
Micah Castleman, 499 Main Street.

2425
03:41:02,432 --> 03:41:03,352
This is a great ordinance.

2426
03:41:03,372 --> 03:41:04,353
Congratulations.

2427
03:41:04,713 --> 03:41:05,693
Super excited to see it.

2428
03:41:05,973 --> 03:41:06,993
Trees are important.

2429
03:41:08,914 --> 03:41:11,174
And actually, trees are super important.

2430
03:41:11,374 --> 03:41:13,295
It's great that we care about them in our city.

2431
03:41:13,875 --> 03:41:17,155
Thank you, Councilor Fallahan for bringing this into the finish line.

2432
03:41:17,175 --> 03:41:19,736
All right, and we have a comment on Zoom.

2433
03:41:21,577 --> 03:41:21,897
Meg.

2434
03:41:22,237 --> 03:41:24,218
Meg Mars, name and address for the record, please.

2435
03:41:24,258 --> 03:41:26,038
You have three minutes.

2436
03:41:26,058 --> 03:41:26,979
Hi, Megan.

2437
03:41:26,999 --> 03:41:27,759
71 Clark Street.

2438
03:41:28,659 --> 03:41:33,701
I've been sticking out this whole time because I really just want to say how excited I am about this committee.

2439
03:41:33,721 --> 03:41:37,142
You know, I walk my dog every day in my neighborhood in the summer.

2440
03:41:37,222 --> 03:41:39,122
It's like really, really grueling.

2441
03:41:39,282 --> 03:41:41,503
We don't have a lot of trees in the hillside area.

2442
03:41:42,323 --> 03:41:46,485
And I think people kind of overlook trees as just something kind of extra.

2443
03:41:46,545 --> 03:41:50,986
But when you make it a better experience to be outside and in your community,

2444
03:41:51,606 --> 03:41:56,029
It just does so much for building neighborhood connections, community connections.

2445
03:41:56,329 --> 03:41:59,631
Like really having good trees does so much.

2446
03:41:59,671 --> 03:42:00,671
It reduces speed.

2447
03:42:00,711 --> 03:42:05,234
Studies have shown that tree canopies can naturally be a great traffic calming measure.

2448
03:42:05,874 --> 03:42:09,857
And I'm just super excited about it because it's so important in so many ways.

2449
03:42:09,937 --> 03:42:13,358
So thank you so much for getting this passed.

2450
03:42:15,220 --> 03:42:15,880
Thank you, Meg.

2451
03:42:17,433 --> 03:42:21,055
Any further public comment on this proposed ordinance?

2452
03:42:24,037 --> 03:42:32,303
Seeing none, on the motion to ordain for third reading by Councilor Callahan, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, waiving the three readings.

2453
03:42:33,263 --> 03:42:34,384
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2454
03:42:36,325 --> 03:42:37,266
Councilor Callahan.

2455
03:42:37,286 --> 03:42:39,527
Yes.

2456
03:42:39,547 --> 03:42:40,668
Vice President Collins.

2457
03:42:41,028 --> 03:42:41,349
Yes.

2458
03:42:42,829 --> 03:42:43,750
Councilor Lazaro.

2459
03:42:43,830 --> 03:42:43,910
Yes.

2460
03:42:45,831 --> 03:42:46,532
Councilor Lemming.

2461
03:42:53,860 --> 03:42:54,980
Councilor Scarpelli.

2462
03:42:56,601 --> 03:42:57,461
Councilor Singh.

2463
03:42:59,642 --> 03:42:59,822
Yes.

2464
03:43:01,962 --> 03:43:02,743
President Behrs.

2465
03:43:04,143 --> 03:43:04,543
Yes.

2466
03:43:04,563 --> 03:43:06,024
I have an affirmative, none the negative.

2467
03:43:06,044 --> 03:43:07,124
The motion passes.

2468
03:43:08,665 --> 03:43:09,905
Public participation.

2469
03:43:12,146 --> 03:43:15,247
Is there anyone who'd like to speak on anything?

2470
03:43:15,447 --> 03:43:15,927
Come on up.

2471
03:43:16,487 --> 03:43:16,807
Yes.

2472
03:43:16,887 --> 03:43:17,767
We've got one person.

2473
03:43:20,657 --> 03:43:21,357
You have a question?

2474
03:43:21,477 --> 03:43:22,178
All right, we'll take it.

2475
03:43:22,198 --> 03:43:23,539
Name and address for the record, you have three minutes.

2476
03:43:23,679 --> 03:43:27,021
Yeah, Lisa Sario on 19 Paul Road, Medford Mass.

2477
03:43:27,701 --> 03:43:38,047
I just wanted to say that last week at the last minute, just like this, Andrew came up and made a really important kind of like comment about the veterans.

2478
03:43:38,907 --> 03:43:42,149
And he actually, she had a really nice prayer too.

2479
03:43:42,849 --> 03:43:49,393
And I think that we just didn't do that justice last week when we talked about the veterans because

2480
03:43:49,972 --> 03:43:54,595
kind of like important really important that we honor them and appreciate them.

2481
03:43:55,115 --> 03:43:59,658
So I was thinking maybe next year, instead of it being like a, you know,

2482
03:44:00,762 --> 03:44:01,622
not important issue.

2483
03:44:01,662 --> 03:44:11,046
I mean, George said thank you to Andrew, but I mean, I think that somebody, we should do something like maybe for the Wounded Warrior Project or something where we kind of like help out.

2484
03:44:11,707 --> 03:44:12,827
Cause it's like important.

2485
03:44:13,647 --> 03:44:17,509
I get mad when people, I have a, I live with a gold star widow.

2486
03:44:18,009 --> 03:44:23,531
So I know that it's like, can be forgotten, you know, but I just think it shouldn't be forgotten.

2487
03:44:23,631 --> 03:44:27,053
So, and Andrew brought it up and then it was just like, you know, whatever.

2488
03:44:27,793 --> 03:44:43,098
You know, no one said anything like, Oh, thank you for remembering, you know, wasn't remembered I mean ice was remembered but like the veterans weren't remembered, you know, so I think it's important and I'm not I don't want to mean, I don't mean that in a, in a negative way I'm just saying.

2489
03:44:43,758 --> 03:44:47,561
It's just like something important that I think that we should try to do something next year.

2490
03:44:49,002 --> 03:44:54,105
If Veterans Day is on the – well, you'll always hit it, right?

2491
03:44:54,425 --> 03:44:56,407
Well, it's always the 11th, and that moves around.

2492
03:44:56,487 --> 03:44:57,027
Oh, okay.

2493
03:44:57,167 --> 03:44:59,268
So sometimes you won't hit it on the – Right.

2494
03:44:59,349 --> 03:44:59,909
Okay, cool.

2495
03:44:59,929 --> 03:45:01,550
So then maybe we can do something like that.

2496
03:45:01,880 --> 03:45:05,023
collect something for the Wounded Warrior Project, or do something like that.

2497
03:45:05,564 --> 03:45:09,128
Or just even have a veteran come in and talk about his history.

2498
03:45:09,888 --> 03:45:15,074
Anyway, just kind of bothered me that nobody said anything about it last week.

2499
03:45:15,134 --> 03:45:17,456
It was just kind of like, oh, yeah, well, OK.

2500
03:45:18,457 --> 03:45:19,619
It's important.

2501
03:45:19,799 --> 03:45:20,459
That's what I think.

2502
03:45:20,479 --> 03:45:20,800
Thank you.

2503
03:45:21,145 --> 03:45:22,106
Thank you, Lisa, for your comment.

2504
03:45:22,166 --> 03:45:26,189
And I just want to let you know, and maybe Councilor Lemming could speak a little more to this.

2505
03:45:26,809 --> 03:45:32,894
You know, it doesn't always get mentioned at the city council meetings, but the city did have a couple of events for veterans day.

2506
03:45:32,914 --> 03:45:34,936
I think there were some service oriented events.

2507
03:45:34,976 --> 03:45:36,777
I think there's some stuff going on over the next month.

2508
03:45:36,797 --> 03:45:42,702
So it doesn't always come up here, but the city was doing some, some veterans day related work.

2509
03:45:42,762 --> 03:45:45,624
I don't know Councilor Lemming, if you want to mention, I think you attended an event.

2510
03:45:49,367 --> 03:45:49,507
Yeah.

2511
03:45:56,038 --> 03:45:56,478
Understood.

2512
03:46:01,139 --> 03:46:01,520
Thank you.

2513
03:46:02,680 --> 03:46:03,400
I appreciate it.

2514
03:46:03,420 --> 03:46:07,741
I appreciate your comment.

2515
03:46:07,761 --> 03:46:08,562
Thanks for sharing it.

2516
03:46:08,702 --> 03:46:10,322
And I'll go to the podium, name, and address for the record.

2517
03:46:10,342 --> 03:46:11,142
Please, you have three minutes.

2518
03:46:12,683 --> 03:46:14,143
Mike S1499 Main Street.

2519
03:46:15,123 --> 03:46:19,185
I am here again in my ongoing campaign just to

2520
03:46:21,273 --> 03:46:41,966
continue to bring attention to the administration's failure to take ICE seriously or acknowledge it at all in any real or effective way, even though we are seeing abductions, people gone from our city and our community on a weekly basis nearly.

2521
03:46:44,909 --> 03:46:45,549
I'm very tired.

2522
03:46:45,569 --> 03:46:48,430
It's hard for me to get too riled up for this one.

2523
03:46:49,010 --> 03:46:52,372
And it's also been a very pleasant meeting otherwise.

2524
03:46:55,253 --> 03:46:57,633
But it is still an issue.

2525
03:46:58,133 --> 03:47:02,155
The administration still has failed to protect a number of its residents.

2526
03:47:04,015 --> 03:47:14,219
For those who are watching, such that there are many watching at this point, there is a committee of public health and safety.

2527
03:47:14,643 --> 03:47:30,729
committee meeting tomorrow, where the MPD, the Metro Police Department, will pretend to comply with some of the very meager asks that have been given to them.

2528
03:47:30,749 --> 03:47:31,770
But

2529
03:47:36,653 --> 03:47:43,615
Some of us will be presenting actual data about what's been happening in our city at that committee as well.

2530
03:47:44,096 --> 03:47:51,478
So I hope that as many residents as possible will Zoom in or show up in person to that.

2531
03:47:51,498 --> 03:47:52,778
Cause it's really important.

2532
03:47:52,898 --> 03:47:56,419
People are being kidnapped and disappeared and it's not good.

2533
03:47:58,100 --> 03:47:59,480
There's a meeting in the chambers.

2534
03:47:59,560 --> 03:48:04,502
It's the city council's public health and community safety committee chaired by councilor Lazaro.

2535
03:48:05,683 --> 03:48:05,964
6 p.m.

2536
03:48:06,864 --> 03:48:08,666
Wednesday, November 19, 6 p.m.

2537
03:48:12,109 --> 03:48:12,950
I recognize Councilor Zahra.

2538
03:48:12,970 --> 03:48:16,293
You want to share anything more about that, Councilor Zahra?

2539
03:48:17,870 --> 03:48:18,211
Thank you.

2540
03:48:18,711 --> 03:48:22,034
Yes, Chief Buckley will be here 6 p.m.

2541
03:48:22,154 --> 03:48:30,903
tomorrow here in the chambers and we will talk about the report that was submitted by the police department.

2542
03:48:31,683 --> 03:48:37,789
Chief Buckley has been out for a number of months on health with health issues, but he is much better now.

2543
03:48:38,430 --> 03:48:41,853
So I'm eager to speak with him about that and

2544
03:48:44,185 --> 03:48:48,509
have the community be able to hear where we're at as a city.

2545
03:48:51,893 --> 03:48:52,193
Thank you.

2546
03:48:53,194 --> 03:48:53,534
Thank you.

2547
03:48:53,794 --> 03:48:54,515
Go back to the podium.

2548
03:48:55,056 --> 03:48:56,517
Julia, I know you said you had a question.

2549
03:48:56,537 --> 03:49:01,062
Name and address for the record.

2550
03:49:01,862 --> 03:49:07,608
I had stated earlier that it was my understanding reading the 2023 slides and listening to that meeting.

2551
03:49:08,518 --> 03:49:13,840
that sort of there was a trash compost trade-off that if we did the compost, we'd have to switch to every two weeks.

2552
03:49:13,860 --> 03:49:17,621
But it sounds like based on the chief of staff, that it's actually the other way around.

2553
03:49:17,661 --> 03:49:20,462
We can't afford to do the weekly.

2554
03:49:20,502 --> 03:49:22,022
We have to switch to two weeks.

2555
03:49:22,082 --> 03:49:26,204
And compost doesn't cost much was the way that it was presented, I think.

2556
03:49:26,744 --> 03:49:31,125
And it actually is helping to mitigate some of the harm of the every two weeks.

2557
03:49:31,225 --> 03:49:37,007
And I just wanted to make sure I understood one way or the other, because it is a difference in what

2558
03:49:37,985 --> 03:49:49,288
Like if it's decoupled, if compost is just helping and it's not the fault of every two weeks, I think that should be made very clear so that people don't blame compost for every two weeks.

2559
03:49:49,829 --> 03:49:50,089
Yeah.

2560
03:49:50,909 --> 03:49:58,271
I honestly, A, I'm also trying to remember things that happened 30 months ago at this point.

2561
03:49:58,971 --> 03:50:06,874
My understanding is that you're largely correct, that the second truth is correct, that composting is not

2562
03:50:07,935 --> 03:50:13,540
doing composting is not costing us so much that we can't do trash every week.

2563
03:50:13,600 --> 03:50:26,390
The issue is that the contract for waste removal has been going up at a very high rate, and we pay a lot for basically the weight of trash and also recycling.

2564
03:50:26,410 --> 03:50:32,155
So compost reduces the trash weight, and because it happens weekly, it also cuts down the disgusting level every two weeks.

2565
03:50:32,835 --> 03:50:43,358
But I don't know, there were a bunch of other factors and considerations that were supposed to be discussed about the possibility of moving to every other week trash.

2566
03:50:43,838 --> 03:50:57,062
Like basically, if I remember correctly, they were like, well, we want 4,000 people on composting the first year, 8,000 the second year, 12,000 the third year, and then we'll feel like maybe we could make a decision about going to every other week trash after that point.

2567
03:50:57,723 --> 03:50:58,303
We're in year...

2568
03:50:59,677 --> 03:51:02,618
We're at 18 months of the new contract, so we're in the middle of year two.

2569
03:51:03,358 --> 03:51:10,419
I don't know that we're at 8,000 households, you know, even using the composting system, and then I don't know what the plan is around that.

2570
03:51:10,559 --> 03:51:16,701
And it sounded like, from what the Chief of Staff said tonight, that A, there is some, there is a plan.

2571
03:51:17,881 --> 03:51:26,083
It just hasn't been put out and, you know, they talked about doing this before they said what their plan to do it was.

2572
03:51:28,668 --> 03:51:29,689
We don't know what that plan is.

2573
03:51:30,069 --> 03:51:33,112
I don't know if it's gonna meet the conditions of our resolution, quite frankly.

2574
03:51:33,132 --> 03:51:34,553
I think that's my big concern.

2575
03:51:34,633 --> 03:51:36,195
I don't know the answer.

2576
03:51:36,955 --> 03:51:38,897
That's what I remember from 30 months ago.

2577
03:51:40,979 --> 03:51:46,563
And I think the real answer here is the city will have to pay to keep every week trash, right?

2578
03:51:47,324 --> 03:51:49,766
We were gonna have to do that with or without this plan.

2579
03:51:50,487 --> 03:51:55,111
We've been having to do that for 15 years, figure out how to pay for the trash contract.

2580
03:51:56,713 --> 03:52:10,896
and the mayor could present a plan that says here's the trade-off, or here's how we're going to pay for it, or like Councilor Scarpelli said, is there a way to direct fines and fees from certain trash-related things into the program?

2581
03:52:10,976 --> 03:52:13,937
But I think the real issue is we don't know what the mayor's plan is other than that.

2582
03:52:15,097 --> 03:52:18,298
She's now announced that we're doing this, kind of.

2583
03:52:18,538 --> 03:52:19,778
Thank you, I appreciate that.

2584
03:52:19,878 --> 03:52:23,479
I just wanted to make sure compost didn't get blamed for the biweekly,

2585
03:52:24,530 --> 03:52:25,891
as really the help that it is.
