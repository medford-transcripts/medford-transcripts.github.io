00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:06,494
Facing angry parents and a lot of questions, Medford's school superintendent will retire early.

2
00:00:06,874 --> 00:00:13,339
This news comes a week after we learned that he knew about ammunition found in the middle school weeks before anyone reported it to police.

3
00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:14,740
Thanks for joining us tonight.

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,500
I'm Lisa Hughes.

5
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:16,361
And I'm David Wade.

6
00:00:16,401 --> 00:00:18,743
His retirement is not the only change.

7
00:00:18,783 --> 00:00:21,505
Louisa Moeller joins us now with more on the breaking story tonight.

8
00:00:21,525 --> 00:00:21,805
Louisa?

9
00:00:23,578 --> 00:00:26,681
Well, David, Lisa, this all wrapped up less than an hour ago.

10
00:00:26,741 --> 00:00:33,567
The school committee deciding to hold a security audit of all Medford schools and to appoint a new security director.

11
00:00:34,107 --> 00:00:38,832
That and the decision about the superintendent taking them more than four hours.

12
00:00:42,071 --> 00:00:49,355
Supporters of Roy Belson broke into applause as the mayor of Medford commended his 50 years of service to Medford Public Schools.

13
00:00:49,855 --> 00:01:02,462
After a school committee meeting that lasted hours behind closed doors, the crowd learned that the superintendent will retire more than a month early on April 30th, a compromise after many parents called for him to step down.

14
00:01:02,802 --> 00:01:08,885
Well, naturally, you know, I wouldn't like my career to end this way, but it's, you know, but I think that we've still been able to do a lot.

15
00:01:10,486 --> 00:01:12,667
Remember, this is 50 years, 23 as superintendent.

16
00:01:12,847 --> 00:01:18,689
The calls came when the public learned that a loaded gun magazine was found in the McGlynn Middle School back in December.

17
00:01:19,009 --> 00:01:22,910
And while cleaning out his office, the principal inadvertently threw it away.

18
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,191
Belson admits he did not inform police.

19
00:01:26,471 --> 00:01:29,352
Cops finding out about the clip more than two months later.

20
00:01:29,892 --> 00:01:31,332
Belson has now apologized.

21
00:01:31,472 --> 00:01:34,573
But some kids and parents say they still don't feel safe.

22
00:01:35,114 --> 00:01:39,495
A decision was made that people don't agree with.

23
00:01:40,413 --> 00:01:45,716
but it also set off a whole series of concerns in the community and that's never was my intent.

24
00:01:47,997 --> 00:01:58,483
The principal of the McGlynn Middle School is on administrative leave and we learned tonight that the principal of McGlynn Elementary School also knew about that ammunition long before police did.

25
00:01:58,943 --> 00:02:01,465
Live in Medford, Louisa Moeller, WBZ News.

26
00:02:01,905 --> 00:02:02,745
Louisa, thank you.

27
00:02:02,805 --> 00:02:03,546
Tonight we are on
