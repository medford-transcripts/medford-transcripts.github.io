1
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:36,880
Mic check.

2
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,701
Test one, two.

3
00:11:37,761 --> 00:11:38,501
Test one, two.

4
00:11:40,142 --> 00:11:40,322
Good.

5
00:12:12,542 --> 00:12:13,265
I know, I know

6
00:12:44,953 --> 00:12:45,513
th th

7
00:13:16,652 --> 00:13:18,373
I'm not doing nothing without it, right?

8
00:13:18,853 --> 00:13:20,073
Learn my lessons well.

9
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:25,375
He's gonna let me know when we're ready to go.

10
00:13:34,657 --> 00:13:35,437
I know, yeah.

11
00:13:35,577 --> 00:13:37,618
Those are my...

12
00:14:07,407 --> 00:14:09,731
I'm trying to sort out some technical glitch.

13
00:14:12,535 --> 00:14:13,216
I know you know.

14
00:14:13,296 --> 00:14:13,877
That's a part of it.

15
00:14:36,253 --> 00:14:38,055
You know, you know what it is.

16
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:07,444
All right, we're good to go.

17
00:15:33,525 --> 00:15:35,426
So good evening, friends and neighbors.

18
00:15:35,526 --> 00:15:41,768
My name is Terry E. Carter, and I direct elder services here at our beloved West Medford Community Center.

19
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:54,634
Welcome to another live monthly presentation of Fresh Fridays, Words and Music, Rebranded, Cobbed and Sanded for June, our last show before we break for a few months.

20
00:15:55,174 --> 00:15:57,035
We're happy to be back with you tonight.

21
00:15:57,485 --> 00:16:04,814
with a unique conversation that gets us back to our culture-keeping duties here at 111 Arlington Street.

22
00:16:05,155 --> 00:16:14,807
Thanks as always to assistance from the Medford Arts Council, a member of the Massachusetts Cultural Council for helping us do this month after month.

23
00:16:15,722 --> 00:16:26,426
So as the emerging summer continues to heat up, we want to remind you that we want you to stay healthy and we're still trying to be mindful of local health requirements and concerns.

24
00:16:26,766 --> 00:16:29,067
So masking is welcome but not required.

25
00:16:29,523 --> 00:16:40,214
As always, we're just happy to be sponsoring live programming here at the WMCC and glad to see our neighbors, our friends and supporters coming through the doors.

26
00:16:40,715 --> 00:16:42,797
Again, thank you so much for being here.

27
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:50,786
Thanks also to our other principal event sponsor, that's Kevin Harrington of Metro Community Media.

28
00:16:51,471 --> 00:16:59,576
for consistently guiding us as we broadcast you via Medford Community Media Channels 9 for Comcast and 47 for Verizon.

29
00:17:00,596 --> 00:17:03,938
Thanks also to super volunteer Mark Davidson.

30
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:11,642
So if you're out there watching on your electronic devices, your television, welcome to the show.

31
00:17:12,763 --> 00:17:19,507
So before we get into the main business for the evening, we do want to highlight the fact that this community

32
00:17:23,294 --> 00:17:36,787
anniversary and we want to thank everyone who came out for the two commemorative events we held over Memorial Day weekend to celebrate our legacy and our longevity.

33
00:17:37,267 --> 00:17:45,716
Johnny Reed and company did a splendid job on the breakfast and as always Kelly Tucker and her crew made the place look beautiful.

34
00:17:46,256 --> 00:17:47,257
More is coming

35
00:17:53,575 --> 00:17:57,517
I encourage you to say, have a good time and clap.

36
00:17:57,537 --> 00:18:01,419
So this evening's program is really not a complicated one.

37
00:18:02,299 --> 00:18:19,768
At its core, it's about the virtue of friendship, shared experiences, and a home community that's nurtured the minds, bodies, and spirits of a couple of buddies who have been able to then go out and make their own way in the world with a decent measure of it.

38
00:18:22,895 --> 00:18:35,908
So, Calvin A. Lindsey Jr., producer, director, and founder of Centurion Filmworks, began his career at WGBH-TV, Boston's PBS affiliate.

39
00:18:36,389 --> 00:18:40,213
He is a seven-time Emmy Award winner.

40
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:56,773
who served as series producer of Say Brother, one of public television's longest running local community-oriented series.

41
00:18:57,313 --> 00:19:02,075
It has been for a number of years called Basic Black.

42
00:19:02,815 --> 00:19:09,437
His credits include myriad projects ranging from political coverage to documentary and dramatic treatments

43
00:19:10,028 --> 00:19:16,833
Calvin has received the award-winning documentary, conceived the award-winning documentary series, Reflections.

44
00:19:17,334 --> 00:19:33,387
The Reflections series chronicled the lives, seminal moments, and motivations of a number of artists and cultural innovators like Judith Jameson, James Earl Jones, the Nicholas Brothers, and Henry Hampton of Roots.

45
00:19:39,901 --> 00:19:48,437
So another award-winning series featured some of the most notable musicians working in the jazz genre among the performers who

46
00:19:52,635 --> 00:19:56,496
Stanley Turrentine, Ron Cotter, and Roy Haynes.

47
00:19:56,956 --> 00:20:12,461
He wrote, co-produced, and directed The Devil's Music, 1920s jazz, a one-hour film for the PBS series Culture Shock, which examined the often controversial relationship between art, morality, and society.

48
00:20:12,821 --> 00:20:19,283
The New York Times hailed the project as a documentary that addresses the complex interaction of race and class,

49
00:20:19,703 --> 00:20:25,006
and engages viewers in a conversation as vigorous as the art it chronicles.

50
00:20:25,446 --> 00:20:37,452
Lindsay co-produced the PBS nationally broadcast Rebel, a documentary feature about Loretta Janetta Velazquez, one of the approximately 300 women

51
00:20:38,808 --> 00:20:42,969
who fought in the American Civil War disguised as male soldiers.

52
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:50,372
Rebel ultimately received the Organization of American Historians Eric Barnard Award, honorable mention.

53
00:20:50,732 --> 00:21:08,678
His work has been recognized by the National Black Programming Consortium, the Association of Massachusetts Broadcasters, the New York Film Festivals, the Roxbury International Film Festival, and the National Association of Television Arts and Sciences, the Denver Jazz on Film Festival Series,

54
00:21:09,165 --> 00:21:11,846
and the International Documentary Association.

55
00:21:12,827 --> 00:21:28,855
Folks, I am literally just scratching the surface of Calvin's professional credits and have not even mentioned the extensive work he's done and been doing as a longtime director of the city of Cambridge's municipal television station.

56
00:21:29,695 --> 00:21:37,459
Please allow me to introduce to some and reacquaint with others one of the most talented and accomplished brothers I know,

57
00:21:41,423 --> 00:21:49,369
Calvin Lindsey Jr.

58
00:21:50,029 --> 00:21:51,791
He hands me the mic a lot.

59
00:21:51,831 --> 00:21:56,674
He's had me over at Cambridge doing a bunch of different stuff for him over the years.

60
00:21:57,535 --> 00:22:01,758
And he's taught me a lot about the business of television production.

61
00:22:02,078 --> 00:22:08,363
So when Patrick Gordon first came over to help us do

62
00:22:09,156 --> 00:22:30,217
Fresh Fridays and now my man Kevin Harrington, I didn't seem quite as ignorant as I might have otherwise Because I had really been schooled quite well by Calvin So as this is my custom in hosting these evenings I'd like to share just a bit, a little bit of verse to help shape the evening.

63
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:35,871
know by now that I believe that poetry should be, above all things, accessible and inclusive.

64
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:42,397
Sometimes, like the times that we're in right now, it also has to have a little bit of bite to it.

65
00:22:42,657 --> 00:22:44,479
But I'm not going to bite anybody tonight.

66
00:22:44,539 --> 00:22:53,187
This piece is about family, it's about culture, and you may have heard it before, but I think it's appropriate for the evening.

67
00:22:53,207 --> 00:22:54,128
It's called Neighborhood.

68
00:22:55,420 --> 00:23:04,488
Neighborhood is a place where mothers buy extra food for kids that aren't even their own, on the premise that they will eventually show up at the door hungry.

69
00:23:05,449 --> 00:23:17,920
Neighborhood is grandmas and grandpas that raise their children's children long after they've raised their own, lovingly, carefully, happily, long after they've raised their own.

70
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:26,111
Neighborhood is a portable date where that nice Spanish man always gave you 10 cents worth of penny candy when all you ever had was a nickel.

71
00:23:27,132 --> 00:23:30,377
Neighborhood is a homeowner that doesn't look down his nose at the

72
00:23:53,079 --> 00:23:58,383
Neighborhood knows everybody's name, but isn't collecting big data on anyone.

73
00:23:58,463 --> 00:24:05,188
Keeps tabs on strangers, but doesn't discriminate or judge folk by color or caste or custom.

74
00:24:05,609 --> 00:24:15,376
Neighborhood keeps pies and cookies ready to welcome newcomers, and always has something to invite you to, and always has something good to eat when you get there.

75
00:24:16,297 --> 00:24:20,820
Neighborhood loves all of its children, watches out for all the babies,

76
00:24:21,288 --> 00:24:29,029
disciplines fairly, drops dimes carefully, and gaps up consistently, marches for justice dutifully.

77
00:24:30,049 --> 00:24:37,831
Neighborhood cares for its sick with homemade chicken soup, ginger tea, flowers, cards, and pastoral visits.

78
00:24:38,331 --> 00:24:41,491
Never lets you feel lonely, never leaves you alone.

79
00:24:42,352 --> 00:24:51,173
Neighborhood laments the loss of its kings and queens reverently, even while it celebrates their lives jubilantly and recollects their ways permanently.

80
00:24:51,956 --> 00:25:02,780
Neighborhood has well-worn welcome mats, four-way stop signs, and a community gathering place as the hub of the wheel, nicknames like the Port, the Coast, and the Ville.

81
00:25:03,721 --> 00:25:13,485
Neighborhood says yes more than it says no, chooses love over hate, never cries when it could laugh, and never laughs when it should cry.

82
00:25:14,305 --> 00:25:20,988
Neighborhood understands the importance of respect, covers everyone with an umbrella, shovels snow for its elders,

83
00:25:21,329 --> 00:25:28,814
pronounces your name right, and picks up the poop left by its dog, small, medium, and large.

84
00:25:29,554 --> 00:25:35,658
And no matter where you go, neighborhood is always the place you call home.

85
00:25:37,219 --> 00:25:38,260
Let's get to it.

86
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:38,760
So, Cal,

87
00:25:51,677 --> 00:25:59,724
Give us, to start this conversation, three indelible memories you have of life growing up in West Medford.

88
00:26:01,926 --> 00:26:02,746
First, thank you.

89
00:26:02,847 --> 00:26:03,767
Hello, everybody.

90
00:26:04,068 --> 00:26:08,912
This is, like your poem said, it's home.

91
00:26:08,952 --> 00:26:14,496
So certainly one of the big memories is this room, this building, because I grew up here.

92
00:26:14,677 --> 00:26:16,558
We all grew up here, running around here.

93
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:23,394
See, first thing is, I stayed behind the camera.

94
00:26:23,434 --> 00:26:27,076
This is like the hardest thing in life for me to do.

95
00:26:27,116 --> 00:26:29,318
You sit up here with them, I'm like, oh.

96
00:26:29,478 --> 00:26:30,558
So bear with me.

97
00:26:30,658 --> 00:26:33,940
I'm sorry, see, I even lost my breath.

98
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:34,180
Oh, good.

99
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,441
Three indelible memories.

100
00:26:35,541 --> 00:26:37,482
It's the neighborhood.

101
00:26:37,642 --> 00:26:42,445
I mean, the center, the neighborhood, the folks, right?

102
00:26:42,565 --> 00:26:43,886
And we grew up here.

103
00:26:45,027 --> 00:26:46,167
Like, your poem was perfect, right?

104
00:26:46,247 --> 00:26:47,248
Like, you grew up here.

105
00:26:50,705 --> 00:26:53,547
We knew that we could go in everywhere.

106
00:26:53,767 --> 00:26:56,569
Everybody had, everyone had love for us.

107
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,571
They had food for us.

108
00:26:59,111 --> 00:27:02,533
They had, you know, a squinting eye for us.

109
00:27:03,034 --> 00:27:13,340
They had, like, whatever was required, like, this neighborhood and these folks had it and gave it all the time.

110
00:27:14,321 --> 00:27:15,662
And the third, I mean,

111
00:27:19,815 --> 00:27:24,297
You know, I think the third thing I think I go back to are the people.

112
00:27:24,317 --> 00:27:27,718
Like, I learned, especially like now when I look back, right?

113
00:27:28,139 --> 00:27:30,960
There were business owners here.

114
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:36,602
There were, I mean, there was so much culture and so much entertainment, right?

115
00:27:36,983 --> 00:27:47,247
Like, I can, I remember, you know, just as I look out, I can remember as a little kid going down the street, going into the basement,

116
00:28:36,403 --> 00:28:46,950
I can remember being in the driveway and looking up and seeing him sit in the windowsill playing the sax, something like that.

117
00:28:46,970 --> 00:29:00,178
I was thinking, I'm remembering today, the jazz instrumentalist, Jack Dyer, and I can remember taking guitar lessons from him.

118
00:29:00,258 --> 00:29:02,619
And these were, I was a little kid, right?

119
00:29:09,226 --> 00:29:12,708
their time, their attention, just so freely.

120
00:29:12,928 --> 00:29:14,389
Absolutely.

121
00:29:14,529 --> 00:29:15,730
Wow, yeah.

122
00:29:16,311 --> 00:29:19,172
Those are wonderful, wonderful insights.

123
00:29:20,313 --> 00:29:27,638
So, you know, because we toiled in these streets together for many, many years.

124
00:29:27,698 --> 00:29:29,359
How significant was basketball

125
00:29:40,242 --> 00:29:46,605
You know, I can kind of, even though when I tell the story now, it's like, the older I get, the faster I was.

126
00:29:46,965 --> 00:29:52,208
But, you know, ball, that's all we did.

127
00:29:52,228 --> 00:29:54,649
We played ball all the time down here.

128
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:59,892
And, you know, and one of the things, as I'm thinking about it, one of the things that really,

129
00:30:18,603 --> 00:30:21,804
And so, you know, it was interesting, not just, not just in, you know,

130
00:31:12,738 --> 00:31:13,939
I don't know who he was.

131
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:20,504
You know, this man danced on Soul Train, right?

132
00:31:20,524 --> 00:31:28,309
So being embraced by you, by the older cats in the neighborhood was important.

133
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:38,976
And then we also had, I won't call names for this one, but there were a number of guys in the neighborhood who were

134
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:45,391
don't do none of this.

135
00:31:45,831 --> 00:31:49,093
We don't want to see you over here every year.

136
00:31:49,434 --> 00:31:52,136
You go down to basketball court, that's where you belong.

137
00:31:52,656 --> 00:32:00,001
So there were a number of guys who protected us from our suffering.

138
00:32:00,402 --> 00:32:06,226
And that's just, that's home, that's neighborhood.

139
00:32:06,706 --> 00:32:08,027
We both lost our dads.

140
00:32:08,688 --> 00:32:10,549
Yours more recently than mine.

141
00:32:10,976 --> 00:32:16,160
What do you miss about having a real and present father in your life?

142
00:32:20,344 --> 00:32:25,689
The talks, the time and the talks, especially as he got older, especially as I got older.

143
00:32:25,729 --> 00:32:27,450
And it's interesting, I miss fathers.

144
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:30,813
It irritates me, but I also laugh

145
00:32:46,234 --> 00:32:48,665
And one of my, one of my.

146
00:33:18,722 --> 00:33:32,435
And what they were going to do, they were going to buy the building, and they were going to give the community center, they were going to take the first floor of that whole building, and give the community center a 99-year lease for $1.

147
00:33:33,856 --> 00:33:37,819
And I can remember those conversations, and I said, jokingly,

148
00:33:52,657 --> 00:33:59,940
And I'm like, where, like, as I got older, like, where did these dudes, because these were all working, these were working men, right?

149
00:34:00,381 --> 00:34:05,383
And I'm like, where did they get an idea about a 99-year lease?

150
00:34:06,504 --> 00:34:19,250
And, you know, and one of the things that I remember was they were adamant about putting their money behind this project.

151
00:34:34,088 --> 00:34:39,392
It didn't happen for any number of reasons, which is a conversation for another time.

152
00:34:39,632 --> 00:34:46,056
But the fact that as a child, I saw, that's the kind of stuff that I saw.

153
00:34:46,356 --> 00:34:49,479
These guys, these men saw a need.

154
00:34:49,579 --> 00:34:51,540
Oh, I'm sorry, we talked about the first floor.

155
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:15,055
I can remember hearing one of their conversations when they were like, let's be clear.

156
00:35:16,095 --> 00:35:24,158
If we don't do this, the chances are we won't be able to pay to get in what is our neighborhood.

157
00:35:24,198 --> 00:35:29,380
So learning those kinds of lessons took me to go back to your question.

158
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,962
So to talk with my father, to hear different stories,

159
00:35:38,547 --> 00:35:41,368
Yeah, it's really very similar.

160
00:35:42,729 --> 00:35:46,050
I had the luxury, you know, I view it as a luxury now.

161
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:48,331
I didn't view it as a luxury then.

162
00:35:48,391 --> 00:35:49,591
I viewed it as drudgery.

163
00:35:49,811 --> 00:35:52,892
The words sounded like, but they're really different.

164
00:35:53,733 --> 00:35:59,855
Of going with my father for a lot of the jobs that he was doing in West Bedford and beyond.

165
00:35:59,875 --> 00:36:02,876
I mean, there was a time when there were virtually no

166
00:36:03,564 --> 00:36:09,887
houses that you could go into in West Memphis that didn't have a Bonnie Potter ceiling.

167
00:36:10,007 --> 00:36:21,911
And a lot of people view that as a real badge of honor, because his ceiling game was top flight.

168
00:36:22,612 --> 00:36:30,495
So I want to talk to you a little bit, if I can, about Say Brother, more recently known as Basic Black, and how did that work?

169
00:36:59,265 --> 00:37:14,177
and I remember the very first conversation that I had with Barbara, the very first day that I went in, she said to me, she said, listen, she said, I will open up my head and give you every piece of information that I have.

170
00:37:14,697 --> 00:37:19,721
She said, every, she said, I'm going to teach you everything that I know, everything that you need to know.

171
00:37:20,461 --> 00:37:22,583
She said, the only thing that I've

172
00:37:33,052 --> 00:37:39,377
that experience, that series, I mean, shaped my entire trajectory, right?

173
00:37:39,817 --> 00:37:46,001
There were tons of, you know, just the things that we were involved in, right?

174
00:37:46,362 --> 00:37:51,125
I remember the, just some of the big ones, the Charles Stewart murder.

175
00:37:52,426 --> 00:38:01,733
And I remember the next morning, at that time, our correspondent, a lot of folks will remember him, Ravel died.

176
00:38:27,549 --> 00:38:28,030
That's right.

177
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:32,553
And probably 90% of the footage that's in that documentary is out of flash.

178
00:38:32,833 --> 00:38:33,053
Wow.

179
00:38:33,293 --> 00:38:35,415
So we were out there all the time.

180
00:38:53,374 --> 00:39:10,584
the news department, and as the, you know, that morning everybody was like gathering for the verdict, and like you, without, no one did, I mean no one said anything, but like you looked up and

181
00:39:19,699 --> 00:39:21,761
The verdict was read.

182
00:39:22,241 --> 00:39:24,722
You heard a collective groan.

183
00:39:24,782 --> 00:39:28,024
You heard a collective yeah.

184
00:39:28,304 --> 00:39:33,728
And what was so interesting, like the conversations that that sparked, right?

185
00:39:33,768 --> 00:39:45,915
Because there was real, there was just real anger and misunderstanding as to, because what was interesting, I can remember, I'm like, listen, we don't care nothing about her.

186
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:58,931
he didn't do it or that's, it had nothing to do with that at all.

187
00:39:59,351 --> 00:40:04,933
But the, you know, it was such an important time because of the conversations.

188
00:40:05,033 --> 00:40:08,654
It started to really, you know, pull back some band-aids.

189
00:40:08,694 --> 00:40:13,036
We had, we started having some real, some real substantive conversations.

190
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:15,577
And especially, you know, for us like in the,

191
00:40:27,737 --> 00:40:37,659
For those who don't know, in a news space, there's actually somebody who's deciding what is news.

192
00:40:37,699 --> 00:40:42,681
They're making a decision to send their news crew to this place and not to that place.

193
00:40:43,161 --> 00:40:47,382
And again, I don't want to take up a lot of your time on this,

194
00:40:57,217 --> 00:40:59,577
and there's shootings and there's murders and there's this and there's that.

195
00:40:59,597 --> 00:41:05,038
Well, naturally, you're like, that's a bad place, I gotta stay away from that.

196
00:41:05,058 --> 00:41:13,080
And when you get to the understanding that somebody is making that decision to make a narrative about this place.

197
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:16,580
So there was just so many lessons.

198
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:21,721
And then I think the big one that I really, I think is important is that we were taught to

199
00:41:37,183 --> 00:41:41,826
unapologetically put it out there.

200
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:43,227
This wasn't at St.

201
00:41:43,287 --> 00:41:49,991
Robert's, this was at another, when I was doing the film, the national film on the devil's music.

202
00:41:51,071 --> 00:42:00,677
And the executive producer, I remember we were having a conversation with the executive producer, and I wanted to bring, I wanted,

203
00:42:33,242 --> 00:42:35,343
read the phone book today, I love you, right?

204
00:42:35,763 --> 00:42:39,745
But I'm like, there have to be other voices that are involved, right?

205
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:50,451
And so, again, that Safe Brother Foundation to learn how to advocate for us.

206
00:42:50,551 --> 00:42:52,492
That's right.

207
00:42:52,692 --> 00:42:53,813
All right.

208
00:42:54,533 --> 00:42:55,294
Fantastic.

209
00:42:55,814 --> 00:42:56,995
Fantastic.

210
00:42:57,795 --> 00:42:58,696
So quick story.

211
00:43:01,288 --> 00:43:09,895
Calvin is like the single most instrumental brother in my marrying Teresa, my wife.

212
00:43:10,155 --> 00:43:21,165
And, you know, trying to do this quickly is he said he was going to do, was doing a program on Phil Hamilton and his group.

213
00:43:21,185 --> 00:43:23,326
He had a group called Full Circle at the time.

214
00:43:24,067 --> 00:43:25,168
And, you know,

215
00:43:25,898 --> 00:43:34,786
when they would do, you know, these live studio music things, they would bring in a live audience to, you know, sit and enjoy the program.

216
00:43:35,607 --> 00:43:40,311
So, you know, he told me about it and said, oh, T, you need to come to this, so and so and so.

217
00:43:40,631 --> 00:43:41,712
So I said, man, I'm there.

218
00:43:41,772 --> 00:43:48,358
I was working at Leachman at the time in the AV department selling, you know, high-end video stuff.

219
00:43:49,618 --> 00:43:56,181
So I was going into work every day suited and booted, cleaning the Board of Health.

220
00:43:56,281 --> 00:43:56,921
I'm just saying.

221
00:43:57,762 --> 00:44:02,944
So time for the program comes, and I made my way down to the studio.

222
00:44:03,644 --> 00:44:05,865
And Sissy greeted me at the door.

223
00:44:05,885 --> 00:44:08,506
And she's looking at me, and I'm looking at her.

224
00:44:08,526 --> 00:44:14,689
But we didn't know each other, hadn't met each other.

225
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:20,213
But Calvin, you know, the wheels are turning in his mind.

226
00:44:20,973 --> 00:44:33,039
So after the show, and a couple things happened during the show to kind of get us a little bit together, but after the show, he's talking to both of us and he says, oh, and by the way, she went to Fisk University too.

227
00:44:33,139 --> 00:44:33,819
And it was like,

228
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:48,634
You know, light went off in my head and over the next few weeks, you know, we're getting together and talking and, you know, one thing led to another and we ended up getting married and we'll be married 38 years from now.

229
00:44:56,988 --> 00:44:58,569
on campus at the same time.

230
00:44:58,649 --> 00:45:11,994
I graduated the year that she came in as a freshman, and I think I went back for homecoming that year, and she was on campus as a freshman, but I had a girlfriend already that I was going to visit, so there was no half there.

231
00:45:12,434 --> 00:45:17,996
But sure enough, you know, I owe Calvin and St.

232
00:45:18,056 --> 00:45:26,039
Brother for that opportunity, and I don't know that I'd ever get a chance to repay him back all of what I owe him, right?

233
00:45:26,795 --> 00:45:30,157
or to beat him up for some of the aggravation that I get.

234
00:45:30,658 --> 00:45:32,179
Because marriage is hard work.

235
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:34,280
I'm trying to say.

236
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:42,445
Everybody in here who has been there or who is in the institution right now knows that it's not always a bed of roses.

237
00:45:42,485 --> 00:45:43,186
OK, good.

238
00:45:43,386 --> 00:45:44,447
Really good.

239
00:45:46,888 --> 00:45:54,573
So Calvin, I want to ask you about the last project that you

240
00:45:59,296 --> 00:46:07,441
did together, which is, and you'll explain it better than I will, the program about Vidal Igoe.

241
00:46:07,561 --> 00:46:09,262
Okay.

242
00:46:09,702 --> 00:46:23,851
So interestingly enough, this was, this project, so doing a project on Vidal Igoe, it kind of came up that I was actually co-producing that piece.

243
00:46:24,791 --> 00:46:25,312
And so,

244
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:31,235
and I fire in and save others.

245
00:46:42,682 --> 00:46:46,543
more than us in, was the piece that she brought to me.

246
00:46:47,864 --> 00:46:50,265
I knew a little bit, I knew a little bit about it.

247
00:46:50,285 --> 00:46:55,447
I was really kind of fascinated with, does everyone know what a good lie was?

248
00:46:56,287 --> 00:47:03,369
And so I was really kind of fascinated with, just with everything about it.

249
00:47:03,729 --> 00:47:07,511
You know, now, we're in a society, and

250
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:19,420
And what was interesting, as we started doing some of the early research we found out that

251
00:47:33,991 --> 00:47:35,712
remove the pigment from the stick.

252
00:47:36,533 --> 00:47:40,095
For instance, obviously the most famous one, Michael Jackson.

253
00:47:40,115 --> 00:47:41,316
Michael Jackson had a lot.

254
00:47:41,876 --> 00:47:48,500
So all of the, you know, when folks were, you know, coming in and all that, he really had an end.

255
00:47:48,901 --> 00:47:51,743
It's interesting, oftentimes it starts on your hand.

256
00:47:52,463 --> 00:47:58,667
So the thinking is that's where the, when you started wearing that single glove, that was to hide the pigment.

257
00:48:05,219 --> 00:48:09,701
like all of this kind of suffering in silence, right?

258
00:48:09,921 --> 00:48:26,328
And when we did the research, you know, from every kind of time in mankind, every religion, like when you're reading the Bible and you're talking about the leper colonies, in many of those cases, they're talking about little angel colonies.

259
00:48:26,348 --> 00:48:27,869
That's what they would call the lepers.

260
00:48:27,889 --> 00:48:32,951
They would, you know, kind of make people, put people on little things all by themselves and this and that.

261
00:48:38,213 --> 00:48:44,496
of women from around the country who all had different stages of Vallejo.

262
00:48:44,737 --> 00:48:47,278
And so we decided to tell their story.

263
00:48:47,938 --> 00:48:57,543
And also, on a parallel track, we were connected with the medical team that's actually working

264
00:49:02,291 --> 00:49:05,555
who came up with this breakthrough.

265
00:49:05,575 --> 00:49:11,200
So now they have a reliable treatment that will re-pigment the skin.

266
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:17,746
So you see a lot of times they have like a molding treatment that a lot of the commercials don't want to do.

267
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:38,229
And, you know, it was just, it was really, it was especially kind of turning into like what we, what we think of as, you know, just from the TV side, the film side, it was kind of a Valentine's.

268
00:49:41,168 --> 00:49:48,633
And you see here, in some of the stories, it was like two in particular.

269
00:49:49,293 --> 00:49:54,617
It was one of the women in the film.

270
00:49:55,498 --> 00:50:01,162
She never left her house without being fully made up.

271
00:50:01,262 --> 00:50:02,583
Like never, right?

272
00:50:03,003 --> 00:50:07,947
She said she wouldn't take the trash can to the curb unless she was

273
00:50:13,231 --> 00:50:16,717
when her husband left for work.

274
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:24,009
She's like two seconds after she leaves, maybe five, 10 minutes after she leaves for work.

275
00:50:24,429 --> 00:50:25,892
She had her doorbells ringing.

276
00:50:34,898 --> 00:50:40,853
a major car accident, literally at the end of her street.

277
00:50:41,636 --> 00:50:43,480
And she could not go for her house.

278
00:50:56,313 --> 00:51:00,294
and they had to, they had to make use of the job.

279
00:51:00,354 --> 00:51:07,116
I cut this man out of college, that serious, and she's watching from her window just broken because she just can't go out.

280
00:51:07,877 --> 00:51:09,877
She wasn't ready, right?

281
00:51:10,277 --> 00:51:21,901
There was another woman who was in the film who, and she had not, when she was young, she was a swimmer.

282
00:51:23,041 --> 00:51:25,102
By the time you were doing swimming, she had not,

283
00:51:26,642 --> 00:51:36,007
gone swimming in, I think it was like over 30 years, just because she actually couldn't, she wouldn't go out in a bathing suit.

284
00:51:36,087 --> 00:51:38,268
And so she did during, for the film.

285
00:51:38,308 --> 00:51:40,469
So just those kinds of things.

286
00:51:40,549 --> 00:51:41,269
Impact.

287
00:51:41,289 --> 00:51:42,190
Yeah, impact.

288
00:51:42,330 --> 00:51:45,731
And doing a lot of those, a lot of those kinds of films is,

289
00:51:47,553 --> 00:51:49,215
really gratifying.

290
00:51:49,235 --> 00:52:05,973
We're going to try at some point in time to have a showing of the film here because I haven't seen the whole film, I've seen bits and pieces of it, but I really think that the work that was done and the stories that were told

291
00:52:07,655 --> 00:52:11,697
will really, really open a lot of eyes to the condition.

292
00:52:11,957 --> 00:52:30,527
And for those of you that may have never heard the word before, it's basically a genetic condition where there is an unevenness to the pigmentation that manifests itself in splotches and blotches, in discolorations in the skin tone.

293
00:52:31,938 --> 00:52:38,301
some which can be very disconcerting when you first see them.

294
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:39,301
I just want to add one more thing.

295
00:52:40,081 --> 00:52:55,788
One of the other pieces, and we really didn't have a chance to get into this too deeply in the film, but one of the other pieces that was really fascinating to me from the cultural space was now you're actually seeing a couple of major corporations

296
00:53:08,835 --> 00:53:28,611
And so one of the things that I was looking at that was really interesting to me was, kind of given this country's history around culture, was what is the attraction here?

297
00:53:40,122 --> 00:53:48,969
So it was like, so trying to kind of look at like where they were going to see it was really important.

298
00:53:49,089 --> 00:53:51,091
And then I asked them, sorry, how did you know?

299
00:53:51,111 --> 00:53:53,153
Come on, this is good, this is great.

300
00:53:53,173 --> 00:53:58,317
Then to find out also that within the community, there's a big,

301
00:54:20,095 --> 00:54:20,675
wrong way.

302
00:54:20,795 --> 00:54:24,257
I don't need to be, quote, fixed, right?

303
00:54:24,357 --> 00:54:30,360
And that was a really interesting debate, an interesting discussion.

304
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:42,445
And I remember, like, we first, or maybe, I don't know, one of the times that that really kind of got into my attention was years ago when the cochlear implant came out for the ear.

305
00:54:42,845 --> 00:54:44,806
And there was a large debate

306
00:54:48,778 --> 00:54:50,701
Well, I don't need fixing that.

307
00:54:50,781 --> 00:54:52,223
I'll be fixing new people.

308
00:54:52,243 --> 00:55:05,702
There's a lot of... just a lot of... So stay tuned, because like I said, at some point in time, hopefully, you know, relatively soon, we're gonna try and screen that film here.

309
00:55:06,222 --> 00:55:12,606
I mean, I have so much, and I obviously don't have the luxury of time to do it all.

310
00:55:12,926 --> 00:55:16,308
So I'm going to do a little bit of a lightning round with you.

311
00:55:17,148 --> 00:55:21,791
And so maybe we'll keep the answers a little bit more brief.

312
00:55:22,672 --> 00:55:25,834
But I just want you to reflect on a few things.

313
00:55:27,194 --> 00:55:29,936
So a quick reflection on Phil Hamilton.

314
00:55:30,676 --> 00:55:32,057
That's my man right there.

315
00:55:32,337 --> 00:55:32,738
I know.

316
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:41,850
So, you know, Phil, and we all refer to ourselves, that's my first friend.

317
00:55:54,295 --> 00:56:02,538
And one of the early kind of musical recollections is, so we were down here at Southern Campus Center.

318
00:56:02,978 --> 00:56:05,739
Every Friday, right, the bus would come.

319
00:56:05,799 --> 00:56:08,140
You get your permission for this.

320
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:12,221
You have your little, you know, $0.50 in your pocket.

321
00:56:12,841 --> 00:56:14,422
And, you know, we were going somewhere.

322
00:56:15,062 --> 00:56:23,145
And I remember going to, like, Canyon Lake Park or Whalen Park or something, and Phil

323
00:56:32,945 --> 00:56:38,472
I see him now in terms of percussionists and his vocals.

324
00:56:38,592 --> 00:56:42,297
I've seen him in nightclub small venues.

325
00:56:42,317 --> 00:56:45,281
I've seen him when he was singing with Patton.

326
00:56:45,461 --> 00:56:47,003
I've seen him in that major.

327
00:56:47,023 --> 00:56:48,966
All of a sudden I see my boy.

328
00:56:53,379 --> 00:56:58,185
All right, so good friend of both of ours, God rest his gentle soul, Aaron McDaniel.

329
00:56:58,325 --> 00:56:59,607
Aaron, just what a great guy.

330
00:57:16,984 --> 00:57:23,748
And so he came up here for a visit when he was a little kid.

331
00:57:23,908 --> 00:57:25,869
He was five, six years old.

332
00:57:26,309 --> 00:57:27,690
We all got to be friends.

333
00:57:28,490 --> 00:57:33,333
And some kind of way, it was like, okay, you know what, Aaron's going to go to school up here.

334
00:57:45,768 --> 00:57:46,689
when I went to college.

335
00:57:46,709 --> 00:57:52,596
That was going to be one of my, it was going to be the Middlebury experience.

336
00:57:52,636 --> 00:58:00,206
But anyways, for those of you who never met or didn't know Aaron McDaniels, he was a good dude, period.

337
00:58:00,246 --> 00:58:03,970
But he was also a remarkable photographer.

338
00:58:05,571 --> 00:58:23,340
His photographic work has been on display in museums and he's really traveling throughout places like Santorini, Greece and just really exotic locations and doing amazing, amazing photographic work.

339
00:58:23,641 --> 00:58:31,905
So he has that as a legacy and maybe at some point in time we'll figure out a way to get some of his photography here so that folks can see it.

340
00:58:33,185 --> 00:58:36,066
So I'm going to ask you about one more thing.

341
00:58:37,187 --> 00:58:39,247
Monument and Houlton Street.

342
00:58:39,327 --> 00:58:40,628
Monument and Houlton Street.

343
00:58:40,668 --> 00:58:40,988
Yeah.

344
00:58:41,208 --> 00:58:44,169
So we have, we just called the whole area of the building.

345
00:58:44,209 --> 00:58:44,489
Yeah.

346
00:58:44,609 --> 00:58:47,010
We called it our way, you know, Bunk Hill.

347
00:58:47,050 --> 00:58:48,070
Bunk Hill.

348
00:58:48,110 --> 00:58:48,610
Bunk Hill.

349
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:50,131
Bunk Hill.

350
00:58:50,151 --> 00:58:54,592
Bunk Hill boys up there, which we, which is interesting, you know, made for.

351
00:59:00,035 --> 00:59:04,339
But it was, you know, it was nice, of course, you know, Terry, Hamilton, Peter Phyllis,

352
00:59:20,367 --> 00:59:24,929
It's too funny, too funny.

353
00:59:25,129 --> 00:59:26,650
The Braxton's had dogs.

354
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:30,111
And they had Butch and they had Jomo.

355
00:59:32,292 --> 00:59:36,133
And these were chasing biting dogs.

356
00:59:36,433 --> 00:59:40,535
So we were having a good time, but we always had an I.O.

357
00:59:41,175 --> 00:59:46,959
with Joel and Pesky were on the loose, right?

358
00:59:46,979 --> 00:59:49,021
Because that was before leash laws.

359
00:59:49,401 --> 00:59:51,603
So dogs basically used to run the street.

360
00:59:51,903 --> 00:59:55,245
And when I say run the street, I meant they ran the street.

361
00:59:55,325 --> 01:00:01,250
And would keep you from going places that you wanted to go sometimes.

362
01:00:01,270 --> 01:00:04,292
I think I want to do one more.

363
01:00:04,412 --> 01:00:04,952
Uncles in the Ville.

364
01:00:13,938 --> 01:00:16,079
There were so many.

365
01:00:16,199 --> 01:00:17,620
There were so many.

366
01:00:19,061 --> 01:00:23,603
You know as well, even just driving in here.

367
01:00:24,143 --> 01:00:27,165
I'm here all the time.

368
01:00:27,285 --> 01:00:40,511
But it's interesting how this is a place, whenever I drive in, just for habit, I rarely go the same place the same way twice.

369
01:00:40,531 --> 01:00:41,832
I just wanted to see something different.

370
01:00:54,737 --> 01:01:01,699
like whenever, like when there were so many folks, just had so much influence, right?

371
01:01:01,779 --> 01:01:10,401
So many folks that you had to, that were looking out for you, even when you didn't know they were looking out for us.

372
01:01:10,521 --> 01:01:14,442
And, you know, to be, for me, I say constant, constant, right?

373
01:01:14,562 --> 01:01:17,723
It's like everybody was here, it's just, you know,

374
01:01:22,882 --> 01:01:27,826
when I'm coming in to go, is again, driving, driving, different way all the time.

375
01:01:28,127 --> 01:01:30,088
And I know I'm going to see somebody.

376
01:01:30,609 --> 01:01:43,100
And whether, you know, sometimes, you know, I have occasions to stop and talk, sometimes just drive by, but everybody I see, I'm like, oh, there's a connection, there's a story, you know what I'm saying, right?

377
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:44,681
And what happens, like,

378
01:01:51,385 --> 01:01:55,188
It's neighborhoods.

379
01:01:56,229 --> 01:02:09,960
Again, I said it before, I'll say it again, we're really, really only scratching the surface of where a conversation like this could go because one, we've known each other since we were both

380
01:02:11,181 --> 01:02:18,667
just little sprites, but two, we've gone through some things together.

381
01:02:18,727 --> 01:02:30,557
We've actually had some challenging times, never with our friendship, never with our relationship, but just in terms of family history and family dynamics.

382
01:02:30,577 --> 01:02:37,963
We've both gone through some things, so we have a lot in common, and the reason why I wanted to have this conversation

383
01:02:38,143 --> 01:02:50,567
Calvin, maybe more than anyone else that I know, it's because there's always been a remarkable measure of respect between the two of us.

384
01:02:51,808 --> 01:02:59,070
We may have had a disagreement, I don't really recall one, but throughout our friendship

385
01:03:00,350 --> 01:03:02,791
respect has never been breached.

386
01:03:02,811 --> 01:03:11,576
There's never been a point in time where I felt like, or, you know, or discern that he felt that way about me.

387
01:03:11,636 --> 01:03:16,238
So aside from his accomplishment, and again, you know,

388
01:03:16,538 --> 01:03:25,266
really, there's so much more that you don't know about him and that he probably would feel some kind of way about me, you know, trying to talk about all of it.

389
01:03:25,626 --> 01:03:30,110
But I just want you to know that this is one of the

390
01:03:31,828 --> 01:03:40,357
the best examples of what can be produced by a community when it looks out for its own.

391
01:03:40,737 --> 01:03:50,748
I don't want to put anybody off or anything like that, but the truth of the matter is none of us, I never get to a place where I become

392
01:03:51,408 --> 01:03:57,591
the poet laureate of the city without the folks that looked out for me as I was coming up.

393
01:03:58,292 --> 01:04:03,134
And he never gets to be, you know, the former executive producer of St.

394
01:04:03,174 --> 01:04:11,139
Bravo or the current director of Municipal Cable at the City of Cambridge without the folks that looked out for him.

395
01:04:11,559 --> 01:04:17,262
So in presenting this conversation this evening, I just, you know, hope that

396
01:04:22,701 --> 01:04:27,343
may take a little bit of a measure of pride about who it produced.

397
01:04:28,404 --> 01:04:29,625
And credit, yeah.

398
01:04:29,865 --> 01:04:30,725
And credit, yeah.

399
01:04:31,045 --> 01:04:32,786
All the credit y'all wanna take, you know.

400
01:04:33,127 --> 01:04:34,707
It's credit, right?

401
01:04:34,868 --> 01:04:40,491
And if you take too much, my mother will probably whisper it in your ear, or your dad will whisper it in your ear.

402
01:04:40,611 --> 01:04:42,672
Listen, you didn't do all that.

403
01:04:42,972 --> 01:04:45,994
You did some of it, we did most of it, all right?

404
01:04:46,374 --> 01:04:48,055
So Calvin, thank you so much.

405
01:04:48,375 --> 01:04:48,696
Amen.

406
01:04:55,737 --> 01:05:01,159
Thank you for your broad perspective and great insight to the cultural community and great method.

407
01:05:02,039 --> 01:05:09,502
It's always important work that you've been engaged in as you continue to make films and give voice to the voiceless.

408
01:05:09,622 --> 01:05:14,284
We'll be watching, we'll definitely be watching to our audience, both here and elsewhere.

409
01:05:17,406 --> 01:05:26,255
discussion and thanks for coming along with us as we continue to refresh for greater flexibility and bring the best stories and entertainment possible.

410
01:05:26,676 --> 01:05:39,009
As I always like to say, get ready for something very special on the musical side of the coin right after we take a break to reset our stage and share some WMCC announcements.

411
01:09:05,180 --> 01:09:06,121
All right.

412
01:09:06,161 --> 01:09:08,662
Yeah, she's right next to me.

413
01:09:08,862 --> 01:09:11,043
Oh, she's a sweetheart.

414
01:09:34,296 --> 01:09:48,207
Okay, so that we can kind of stay on schedule and give our musical guests a full opportunity to display their wares.

415
01:09:50,249 --> 01:09:59,456
We feature another performer this evening that has gained a dedicated local following and has made great friends as a singer and a stage performer.

416
01:09:59,476 --> 01:10:02,979
Ladies and gentlemen, may I present Anita Wood.

417
01:10:03,852 --> 01:10:07,895
also known as AJ.

418
01:10:08,535 --> 01:10:10,896
For like 24 years a Medford native?

419
01:10:11,137 --> 01:10:13,678
Okay, 24 years a West Medford native.

420
01:10:13,818 --> 01:10:15,679
Okay, press card, okay.

421
01:10:15,719 --> 01:10:21,643
She is a versatile vocalist with roots in musical theater and acapella singing.

422
01:10:22,103 --> 01:10:30,769
She studied under Laura Serafino for 10 plus years and has more recently dove headfirst into the jazz scene.

423
01:10:31,618 --> 01:10:50,581
She has had the pleasure of being the lead vocalist of the Chelmsford Jazz Ensemble since the summer of 2022, where she rediscovered her love for the American songbook, where singers like Sarah Vaughan and Elephant Gerald and

424
01:10:52,042 --> 01:10:54,983
all got a lot of their most wonderful music from.

425
01:10:55,043 --> 01:10:59,884
Since the fall of 2023, she's become active in the local jazz jam circuit.

426
01:11:00,285 --> 01:11:09,807
And as the months passed, musical connections were made with talented local players, which led to friendships and the formation of AJ and the Groove.

427
01:11:10,748 --> 01:11:14,589
She is thrilled to be part of West Medford's Fresh Friday.

428
01:11:14,609 --> 01:11:15,689
She said that, not me.

429
01:11:16,089 --> 01:11:18,790
And to share with you her love of jazz,

430
01:11:19,318 --> 01:11:27,184
Welcome back to West Medford, AJ and the Groove featuring Steve Linscott on alto saxophone.

431
01:11:28,965 --> 01:11:36,330
And Carolyn Sue Howard, Jessu, Jessu Howard on piano, okay?

432
01:11:37,391 --> 01:11:39,212
Alright, alright, alright.

433
01:11:39,393 --> 01:11:44,216
And you know, for those of you wonderful seniors out there who come and support us

434
01:11:45,623 --> 01:11:53,868
that we do is a wonderful, amazing member of your own community, that dear of the senior community, on the keys, I think.

435
01:11:54,048 --> 01:11:57,210
I think you're going to enjoy her.

436
01:11:57,230 --> 01:12:02,373
I had an opportunity to listen to her come in on the door, and she is a wonderful player.

437
01:12:02,393 --> 01:12:05,875
So without further ado, AJ and the group.

438
01:12:08,196 --> 01:12:09,497
I want to thank Terry for having me back.

439
01:12:09,557 --> 01:12:10,958
I met Terry about a year and a half ago.

440
01:12:10,998 --> 01:12:12,959
I came here for a jazz jam.

441
01:12:13,559 --> 01:12:15,140
And I had the pleasure of meeting Terry.

442
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:16,441
And he's like, oh, we should connect.

443
01:12:16,501 --> 01:12:18,021
And so we finally got this to happen.

444
01:12:18,542 --> 01:12:21,163
But Terry, your presentation was wonderful.

445
01:12:21,243 --> 01:12:22,124
And you did so many words.

446
01:12:22,144 --> 01:12:23,224
So let's start with a little music.

447
01:12:23,244 --> 01:12:24,645
So we're going to start with a little instrumental.

448
01:13:11,759 --> 01:13:14,580

East of the sun and west of the moon We'll build a dream house of love dear Close to the sun and day

455
01:17:52,562 --> 01:18:14,704
Near to the moon at night We'll live in a lovely way, dear Living on love and a pale night Just you and I Forever and a day Love will not die We'll keep it that way

456
01:18:17,593 --> 01:18:36,703

Close to the sun of the day Near to the moon at night Livin' in a lovely way, dear Livin' on an island in a pale moonlight Just you and I, forever and a day

462
01:21:22,015 --> 01:21:48,464
Love will not die, we'll be there for thee Among the stars we'll find a harmony in life, too, and a love, too East to the sun, west to the moon, dear East to the sun and west of the moon

463
01:21:50,704 --> 01:22:01,693
East of the sun and west of the moon East of the sun and west of the moon

464
01:22:20,531 --> 01:22:23,762
Next up, we're going to switch it up a little bit with a Latin tune called Fascinating Rochelle.

465
01:23:07,553 --> 01:23:22,502
Besame, besame mucho Como si fuera esta noche la ultima vez Besame, besame mucho

466
01:23:39,267 --> 01:23:45,049
Tengo miedo a perderte y perderte después.

467
01:23:45,389 --> 01:23:54,792
Quiero tenerte muy cerca, mirarme en tus ojos, verte junto a mí.

468
01:23:55,352 --> 01:24:02,474
Piensa que tal vez mañana yo ya estaré lejos, mil lejos de ti.

469
01:24:02,494 --> 01:24:03,034
Bésame.

470
01:24:07,153 --> 01:24:33,510
Besame mucho Como si fuera esta noche la ultima vez Besame Besame mucho Que tengo miedo a perderte, perderte despues

471
01:24:37,828 --> 01:24:39,310
do do

472
01:25:02,904 --> 01:25:02,985
do

473
01:25:43,097 --> 01:25:46,099
Thank you.

474
01:26:10,420 --> 01:26:11,341
do do

475
01:27:01,485 --> 01:27:04,168
Besame, besame mucho

476
01:27:30,073 --> 01:27:39,581
Each time I cling to your kiss, I hear music divine.

477
01:27:39,661 --> 01:27:46,307
Besame, besame mucho.

478
01:27:46,447 --> 01:27:54,815
Hold me, my darling, and say that you'll always be mine.

479
01:27:57,673 --> 01:28:04,134
This joy is something new, my arms enfolded, you never knew this thrill before.

480
01:28:04,255 --> 01:28:15,977
Whoever thought I'd be holding you close to me, it was with you I opened the door.

481
01:28:16,317 --> 01:28:19,558
Dearest one, if you should leave,

482
01:28:31,820 --> 01:28:54,400
Mesame, mesame mucho Love me forever and may all my dreams come true Love me forever and may all my dreams come true

483
01:29:03,348 --> 01:29:05,609
come true.

484
01:29:51,515 --> 01:30:09,328
Not the pale moon that sets me, that thrills and delights me alone.

485
01:30:09,589 --> 01:30:14,332
It's just the nearness of you.

486
01:30:14,532 --> 01:30:20,357
It isn't your swing.

487
01:30:23,330 --> 01:30:33,627
Oh no, it's just a near-death experience.

488
01:30:39,097 --> 01:30:44,661
When you're in my arms And I feel you so close to me All my wildest dreams

489
01:31:07,926 --> 01:31:28,145
I need no soft light to enchant me If you only grant me the right to hold you ever so

490
01:31:31,620 --> 01:31:41,744
And to feel in the night The nearness of you.

491
01:32:31,013 --> 01:32:36,798
I'm going to play it.

492
01:32:59,817 --> 01:33:00,578
so so

493
01:33:40,869 --> 01:34:01,255
It's not the pale moon that sets me That thrills and delights me Oh no It's just the nearness of you

494
01:34:07,071 --> 01:34:26,176
It isn't your sweet conversation that brings this sensation Oh no, it's just the nearness of you

495
01:34:34,723 --> 01:34:42,686
And I feel you so close to me.

496
01:34:42,866 --> 01:34:54,569
All my wildest dreams come true.

497
01:34:55,129 --> 01:34:56,990
I need no sunlight.

498
01:34:59,085 --> 01:35:16,026
to enchant me if you only grant me the right to hold you ever so tight

499
01:35:26,628 --> 01:35:39,010
the nearness of you.

500
01:35:46,252 --> 01:35:51,213
We're going to move on to a couple of instruments.

501
01:36:09,195 --> 01:36:09,735
do do

502
01:36:42,787 --> 01:36:43,287
do do

503
01:37:12,820 --> 01:37:12,920

505
01:37:59,065 --> 01:38:01,226

so so

512
01:46:28,085 --> 01:46:31,127
Next time, we're about a week away from the title of this song.

513
01:46:57,298 --> 01:47:22,814
Summertime and the livin' is easy Fish are jumpin' and the cotton is high One of these mornings you're gonna rise up singin' So hush little baby, don't you cry

514
01:47:25,583 --> 01:47:32,486
One of these mornings, you're gonna rise up singing.

515
01:47:32,546 --> 01:47:40,510
Then you spread your wings and you change the sky.

516
01:47:40,610 --> 01:47:47,594
But till that morning, there's nothing can harm you.

517
01:47:47,614 --> 01:47:50,115
So hush, little baby, don't

518
01:47:51,069 --> 01:47:52,850
to cry.

519
01:48:44,575 --> 01:48:54,541
Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music

520
01:49:44,237 --> 01:49:49,278
Summertime, and living is easy.

521
01:49:49,298 --> 01:49:56,600
Fish are jumping, and the cotton is high.

522
01:49:56,760 --> 01:50:03,502
One of these mornings, I'm singing.

523
01:50:11,468 --> 01:50:24,263
So hush, little baby, don't you cry One of these mornings, you're gonna rise up singing And spread your wings and take to the sky

524
01:50:37,384 --> 01:50:58,891
If nothing can harm you So hush, little baby, don't you cry So hush, little baby, don't you cry So hush, little baby, don't you cry

525
01:51:33,090 --> 01:51:58,415
Quiet nights of quiet stars Quiet chords from my guitar Floating on the silence that surrounds us Quiet thoughts and quiet dreams Quiet walks by, quiet screams

526
01:51:59,316 --> 01:52:18,475
And the window looking on the mountains and sea How lovely, this is where I want to be Here with you, so close to me until the final flicker

527
01:52:19,419 --> 01:52:24,102
of my icebergs.

528
01:52:24,762 --> 01:52:29,224
I was lost and lonely.

529
01:52:29,864 --> 01:52:37,828
Believing life was only a bitter tragic joke to find with you.

530
01:52:45,688 --> 01:52:46,849
Oh my love.

531
01:53:44,332 --> 01:53:45,873

01:54:59,131 --> 01:54:59,251
So,

534
01:55:27,648 --> 01:55:36,364
Quiet nights of quiet stars, quiet chords to my guitar.

535
01:55:36,465 --> 01:55:40,312
Floating on the silence that surrounds me.

536
01:55:47,096 --> 01:56:14,237
And quiet dreams, quiet walks, quiet streets And the window looking on at the mountains and the sea How lovely, this is where I want to be Here with you, so close to me Until the final flicker

537
01:56:15,308 --> 01:56:20,090
of life's ever burning.

538
01:56:20,250 --> 01:56:31,474
I was lost and lonely, believing life was only a bitter, tragic joke.

539
01:56:32,715 --> 01:56:43,639
Had fun with you, the meaning of existence, oh my love.

540
01:56:46,108 --> 01:57:10,445
Oh my love Oh my love My love Terry's given me one more song.

541
01:57:14,763 --> 01:57:17,125
It requires a little audience participation.

542
01:57:17,165 --> 01:57:20,227
That one was quite a bit by Pia Starr's Corcovado.

543
01:57:21,708 --> 01:57:25,931
But this one, you definitely know, and you're required to participate.

You were inspired, so wonderful.

571
02:02:39,162 --> 02:02:39,902
That's a wrap.

572
02:02:40,222 --> 02:02:40,723
Oops, whoops.

573
02:02:46,383 --> 02:02:48,104
I don't even know if I'm making a difference at this point.

574
02:02:48,305 --> 02:02:54,710
But anyways, so this is a wrap for this live edition of WMCC's Words in Music program.
