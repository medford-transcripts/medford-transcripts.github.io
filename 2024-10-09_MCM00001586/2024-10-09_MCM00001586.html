    <p>[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=92.603">I</a>  can, but I'm trying to get myself up.</p>

    <p>[Jennifer Keenan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=95.484">I'm</a>  having... No problem. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=99.425">As</a>  long as you can hear us and we can hear you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=101.706">No,</a>  don't fret about your camera for the time being. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=104.226">Okay,</a>  sure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=105.667">Okay,</a>  thanks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=108.087">Okay,</a>  so up first tonight is 110 Brooke Street. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=112.088">We're</a>  going to have a preferably preserved hearing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=115.109">And</a>  at this point, Ryan, I'm going to turn the meeting over to you, and I'm going to recuse myself from this case. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=123.372">And</a>  you guys are good because you have Eleni, Peter and Ed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=128.237">Okay,</a>  I'm going to shut my camera off, mute myself and you can text me when it's ready to come back.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=133.662">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jennifer Keenan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=134.583">Okay,</a>  thanks.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=137.937">Just</a>  to recap for the general public, the Historical Commission had a meeting last month where we determined 110 Brooks Street to be historically significant. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=150.883">We</a>  placed up on the Medford Historical Commission website under the news section, the MHC Form B and our letter that describes why the building was found to be significant. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=164.69">This</a>  is the second part of the demolition delay process where we determine whether or not the building is preferably preserved. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=173.381">So</a>  we ask that the public provide comments to the commission if you wish to speak. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=181.13">There</a>  will be a <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=183.693">about</a>  a five minute time allocated to persons wishing to speak for or against the project when I open up the public comment period and if you could before speaking just raise your hand and we'll call on you and if you could before you speak just your name and address for the record okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=203.428">But</a>  we'll start off this process with the commissioner's comments. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=207.009">And</a>  tonight we're determining preferably preserved status, which according to the bylaws, chapter 48, section 77, preferably preserved significant building means any significant building as to which the commission determines as provided in subsections 48-78G, that it is in the public interest to be preserved and rehabilitated rather than demolished. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=230.898">So</a>  we are looking tonight to hear comments on the integrity of the building, everything short of the condition of the building, meaning the actual physical structural condition that is a purview of the building department. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=246.857">We</a>  don't hear that portion of the <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=251.342">structure</a>  it's in his purview to order buildings down if structural issues are a cause or we're hearing about the historic persons or people or activities at this particular building or what we are most interested in or general comments from the neighbors and the community as to whether or not the building should be found preferably preserved and preserved and rehabilitated rather than demolished and <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=276.635">And</a>  this is a case of partial demolition. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=279.056">So</a>  this property, as we mentioned in last month, should have been flagged by the building department. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=284.897">But</a>  unfortunately, it fell by the radar. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=286.997">And</a>  we're reviewing this case following the demolition that took place. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=291.559">But</a>  the commissioners in cases like this, as in all cases, we determine <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=297.58">the</a>  status based on how the building lies, but also what the building was prior to the demolition that took place. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=304.727">So</a>  you guys can see on the MHC inventory form, if you look that up on our website, what the building's condition was. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=311.134">We</a>  also have a picture posted on our website. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=315.618">commissioners</a>  does anybody want to start off with a motion and that will kick start discussion and then we will go from there and then after the public comment period we'll finish up with the vote and and take steps accordingly.</p>

    <p>[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=337.399">I'll</a>  make a motion to find <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=342.888">Uh,</a>  this building, uh, preferably preserved. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=346.449">Sorry,</a>  I forgot the address. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=348.17">Uh,</a>  110 Brooks Street perfectly preserved.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=353.472">In</a>  a 2nd, I'll 2nd. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=360.394">Great,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=361.495">Uh,</a>  Peter, do you want to start with a discussion and we'll I'll come to a Lenny and then the rest of us will.</p>

    <p>[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=369.278">Comment</a>  to her. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=372.322">As</a>  in the finding of significance, although the house has been denuded of its siding and windows, I feel like there is still extant detail, the front porch in particular, the <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=398.002">attic</a>  window has some nice detail. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=401.545">And</a>  I feel like the overall mass and, uh, uh, of the building is still intact and could be brought back. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=413.837">I</a>  know that previously the original siding had been covered with, uh, vinyl and probably windows replaced anyway. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=421.945">So,</a>  um, <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=424.514">Although</a>  it looks like it's been stripped, which it has from the outside, I still feel like the building has a majority of its integrity intact. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=435.543">And</a>  I don't believe further demolition is happening, or at least from the drawings I saw that proposed, I knew they were going to tear off the rear L. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=452.52">which</a>  I think was a later edition anyway. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=457.241">Yeah,</a>  so I feel like this house is a good candidate. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=462.422">Similar</a>  homes to this in the neighborhood, we did find preferably preserved. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=470.884">That's</a>  where I'm coming down on this for now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=472.684">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=475.204">Lenny?</a> </p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=477.045">Yeah,</a>  I agree with Peter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=479.192">I</a>  think the details that sort of are worth preserving for this building is the attic window and then the columns on the front, sort of like a pattern with the two columns in the front and the back, I think is something worth keeping. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=494.78">And</a>  I do also agree with the removal of that rear addition. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=500.183">I</a>  think that adds to the quality of the building and the design and sort of restoring it back to what it used to look like. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=511.477">Yeah,</a>  I mean, I think, I mean, I pretty much agree with Peter and, you know, I'm ready to pass it along to Ed.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=519.363">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=520.063">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=520.944">Ed,</a>  comments?</p>

    <p>[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=524.406">Again,</a>  given the history of the work on the building, given what we've seen of the history in terms of what was removed, <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=537.173">And</a>  the intent of basically, this is really a restoration rather than a demolition, I think, yes, it should be preserved, but I think it hopefully will be a short proceeding.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=554.05">Great,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=556.372">All</a>  right, we're gonna <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=558.707">open</a>  it up to public comments. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=561.669">I'd</a>  like to ask the homeowners if they'd like to make any sort of statement to start with that, and then we'll go with those against the project, those for the project. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=574.015">And</a>  if you would just raise your hand, I'll recognize you as we go along. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=579.158">And</a>  if I don't see anybody else, then we'll close the public comments and go from there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=585.561">Homeowners,</a>  Adriana?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=588.062">Hi,</a>  so I'm Andreana and I am one of the homeowners along with my husband Chris and our daughter Lucia. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=599.146">We</a>  hope that we can work with the historic commission in a forward motion to restore this house to <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=607.809">a</a>  beautiful home and true to its historic value. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=612.093">The</a>  design as we proposed is pretty much in keeping with the original design we feel. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=621.223">Upon</a>  removing those windows when we were <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=626.028">demoing</a>  that home, we actually found that the original window sizes were much larger, and I have selected windows accordingly to ensure that we're in keeping with the original scale of the windows and whatnot, but we're also open to keeping similar columns and such. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=647.419">We're</a>  just hoping that we can move forward as quickly as possible to, uh, you know, avoid any other financial, uh, burdens with this project. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=656.128">So</a>  we look forward to, um, moving on from here.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=663.116">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=663.717">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=665.058">Um,</a>  Chris, anything to add while you're can't hear you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=678.117">He's</a>  with my daughter upstairs. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=679.539">I</a>  apologize.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=680.961">I</a>  just wanted to make sure that he, if he had something to add, I'd be happy to hear him out, but that's okay.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=687.631">Chris,</a>  do you have anything to add?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=691.192">Yes,</a>  the only thing I was actually going to. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=693.514">Sorry,</a>  apologies. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=694.314">I</a>  was trying to do ear buds and clearly technology is not working with me and I'm sitting here with my 5 year old daughter, which. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=702.259">Honestly,</a>  I was so happy for this meeting just to have something easier to do this evening than trying to get a 5 year old to not hop in front of the screen while I'm on it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=712.385">But</a>  I, I do appreciate the fact that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=716.288">That</a>  the historic society has been moving so quickly throughout. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=720.728">This</a>  process everyone has been extremely accommodating to us in the previous meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=724.214">And</a>  as my wife had said, we are keeping, we are keeping the overall integrity of the building as it is there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=731.807">I</a>  believe. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=733.779">Ryan,</a>  you said that at the beginning of the meeting, that it didn't look like there was any new demo that was planned. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=737.96">That</a>  is 100% accurate. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=739.98">We</a>  are not tearing down the building. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=741.501">We've</a>  had no intention of tearing down the building. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=744.201">One</a>  of the reasons that we actually were looking towards moving into this neighborhood, aside from the fact that we thought it would be a great place to raise our family, was how grand this building looked. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=755.764">And</a>  our overall intent is to be able to restore this house to the best of our ability. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=762.245">And</a>  just if we're able to do it, you know, clearly, well, we have the funding to be able to do it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=767.088">So</a>  as quickly as we can go through this process, and we're looking forward to working with you throughout it.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=774.532">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=777.674">All</a>  right, public comments from anybody else at the meeting, if you just want to raise your hand, I'm happy to acknowledge you, Susan, let's start with you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=787.74">I</a>  just need your name and address for the record. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=793.199">And</a>  you've got to unmute yourself. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=797.141">Hold</a>  on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=801.824">Teresa.</a> </p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=803.665">Yes,</a>  I sent them a message. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=804.926">Hi,</a>  Susan.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=805.627">I</a>  was going to say, can you make me co-host because I can just.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=812.285">Are</a>  we on? <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=813.186">Yes,</a>  you are. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=814.366">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=815.667">You</a>  need to say who you are. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=817.929">I</a>  am Yehudi Weiner at 49 Brook Street. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=821.951">This</a>  is Susan Weiner, my beloved wife. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=826.234">And</a>  we are not so close to that threat of demolition or of the renovation of the property, but we walk and we are very much part of the neighborhood. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=837.381">The</a>  building, in my opinion, <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=839.86">And</a>  I'm not an architect, I'm a composer of music, but I've lived with architects. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=844.124">And</a>  I must say what my closest friend of the last 10-15 years was Harry Cobb of New York, whom all of you know well, I'm sure, in the architectural realm. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=860.216">The</a>  building has such beautiful stature. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=863.499">It</a>  sits so handsomely right there on the street. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=869.104">It's</a>  the last of the large buildings on that side of the street. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=874.008">There</a>  are other very attractive domiciles, but that building has a kind of monumental presence, which at the same time, while it's monumental, is not pretentious. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=886.238">And</a>  having cleared the property, we see that there's enormous potential for building there, for grooming the house. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=897.368">And</a>  of course, we don't know the interior of the house. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=899.671">But</a>  I assume with a conscientious, and I would say creative architect, that wonderful things will take place.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=911.081">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=911.642">Anything</a>  else? <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=916.175">I</a>  appreciate your comments. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=917.256">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=921.099">Wendy.</a> </p>

    <p>[Wendy Miller Olapade]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=925.062">Hi,</a>  thank you, Reverend Wendy Miller Olapade. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=927.624">I'm</a>  the resident of the property right across the street from 110. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=932.748">I</a>  live at 105 Brooks, which is owned by the Congregational Church of West Medford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=937.631">I</a>  happen to have the benefit of living in this beautiful neighborhood because of my position as the pastor of that church. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=945.983">And</a>  I just want to affirm my appreciation for the work that's already been done. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=951.105">Sorry</a>  for my weird camera position here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=953.705">I'm</a>  on the move. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=955.406">I</a>  just want to celebrate, you know, the care and commitment that the commission is putting into this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=961.948">But</a>  I do want to encourage you to move promptly because I am tired of looking. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=968.357">looking</a>  at that poor house all torn apart. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=971.799">It</a>  is a beautiful neighborhood and I have no objections at all to moving forward with the plan that our new neighbors have proposed.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=982.083">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=983.204">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=988.026">Heather</a>  and John? <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=992.768">You're</a>  going to unmute yourself? <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=993.648">Hold</a>  on, I'll do it.</p>

    <p>[John Anderson]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=994.849">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=997.77">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=999.371">I</a>  certainly echo Wendy's comments. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1002.812">And</a>  I would just add that this has actually been an ordeal that's been going on for several years as we watched the house sort of become more overgrown, look more and more desolate, lots of negative stuff going on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1020.62">And</a>  actually removing all the aluminum siding and so forth, <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1026.35">actually</a>  improved the look of the house, but we're getting a little tired of looking at the sheeting, and I would just urge the commission, do everything you can.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1038.994">Hold</a>  on, John.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1047.256">You</a>  got muted. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1047.996">Everything</a>  you can.</p>

    <p>[John Anderson]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1058.76">I'm</a>  just, as I was saying, I would just urge you to do everything you can to get this project moving forward as quickly as possible. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1066.265">And</a>  I think I speak for all the neighbors when I say that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1069.588">And</a>  Heather, my wife, would like to say something.</p>

    <p>[Heather]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1073.13">You've</a>  never known me not to rhyme, right?</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1076.352">Just</a>  a quick point. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1077.653">What</a>  is your address?</p>

    <p>[Heather]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1078.534">Just</a>  so that I know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1080.135">102</a>  Brooks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1080.895">102</a>  Brooks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1081.716">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1081.856">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1084.4">I</a>  would just like to comment that this is a house that's been in trouble for over 40 years, that this young couple has come into the neighborhood and made every effort to connect with the neighbors, including joining our current rat project, which is not exactly the kind of thing that I'm sure they have time for at this point. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1107.401">So</a>  they have reached out not only in terms of what they need to do, but they have reached out to assist and become part of the neighborhood in terms of other projects that we have going on as neighbors. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1119.145">So</a>  again, we've seen the pictures, we've seen the 40 years of history, all of the neighbors that are up here tonight, we have all been in communication with each other, and we support <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1131.55">the</a>  Kardashians and the plans that they have. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1134.372">And</a>  we'd like to see them in by Christmas, but that's getting to be a little tricky.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1140.775">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1144.117">Monique.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1146.258">Name</a>  and address for the record. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1155.824">I'll</a>  try again, Monique Doherty. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1162.615">Oh,</a>  there you are. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1163.577">Hello.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1164.479">Oh,</a>  one sec.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1167.925">We</a>  can hear you and you're speaking.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1171.248">So</a>  Adriana and Christopher, Chris, welcome to the neighborhood. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1176.009">I'm</a>  so glad to see something being done with that beautiful architecture. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1181.21">I</a>  have seen the inside and there are so many gems in that building. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1185.851">And</a>  I appreciate all the efforts you're making to make sure that we have an understanding of what your plans are. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1194.512">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1197.293">I</a>  hope we can get this moving for you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1200.744">and</a>  get you into the house. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1201.845">So</a>  welcome to the neighborhood.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1204.146">Monica,</a>  what is your address just so I can... We are across the street, diagonally across the street.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1210.31">Sorry</a>  about that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1211.851">113</a>  Brook Street.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1212.812">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1218.295">Perfect.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1219.296">Anything</a>  else?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1221.437">No,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1222.398">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1223.439">You're</a>  welcome.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1226.641">Any</a>  other public comments?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1230.202">Yes,</a>  I would like to say something.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1231.843">Sure,</a>  Judith, name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1234.584">It's</a>  124 Brook Street. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1243.147">And</a>  Judith Watkinson, as you can see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1247.002">So</a>  I just want to give our support as well for the family. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1254.605">Sorry,</a>  Kadachi is it? <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1256.366">I'm</a>  sorry if I'm not saying it properly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1259.467">We</a>  have been living in the street and the house has been, quite honestly, an eyesore for so long. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1267.331">I</a>  just feel very, very <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1270.703">sad</a>  that things are being held up when somebody is obviously wanting to do a great job and restore it to something really beautiful. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1278.188">So</a>  we just want to express our support for them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1280.829">And</a>  hopefully, we can move forward as quickly as possible on their behalf.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1289.915">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1290.635">Anything</a>  else?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1291.716">That's</a>  it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1292.116">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1292.816">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1293.157">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1294.437">Any</a>  other public comments? <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1299.415">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1299.876">Seeing</a>  none, I'll close public comments and we'll go to the commissioners for final thoughts. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1308.765">Any</a>  further thoughts on the matter? <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1310.787">Any</a>  further discussion on the building? <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1312.188">Otherwise,</a>  I'll do a roll call vote. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1314.511">Motion</a>  was made by Peter Miller to find the building significant, seconded by Eleni. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1322.93">All</a>  right, hearing no opposition, I'll do a roll call vote. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1327.531">A</a>  yes vote for that motion will invoke the up to 18 month demo delay, during which time we would send the plans to the subcommittee who would review them and ask for any architectural changes, and then they would come back for approval for the commission. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1347.414">A</a>  no vote would allow them to move forward with the project as it stands, as it exists <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1351.895">Now</a>  with the building permit, is that understood by all the commissioners? <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1356.657">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1358.958">Roll</a>  call vote, starting with Peter.</p>

    <p>[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1363.28">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1365.441">And</a>  Eleni. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1367.142">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1368.042">And</a>  Ed.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1369.483">Yes,</a>  with the hope this will not be an 18-month case.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1372.404">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1373.044">So</a>  motion passes three to zero. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1376.353">So</a>  what we will do is we will file our letter and then we will immediately send the project to the subcommittee that's Doug and Peter and.</p>

    <p>[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1390.763">Are</a>  you frozen?</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1392.463">So</a>  we'll grab one of the commissioners and then we will review the project. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1398.425">If</a>  there's any architectural changes, we'll set up a time via Zoom to meet with you guys. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1404.067">And</a>  then we have a meeting planned for the second week of November, I believe. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1412.829">So</a>  our hope is that we would get you back <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1416.97">But</a>  if the architectural plans can be changed quickly enough, we may even be able to do it at the end of this month. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1424.192">I</a>  don't think we need it, but there may be an opportunity to just finish up and release the project at the end of the month if all those very minimal architectural changes that I think the commission will ask for can be taken care of. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1439.297">Does</a>  that make sense?</p>

    <p>[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1442.938">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1444.02">So</a>  we will summarize that in our letter, and I'll send out something. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1449.682">I</a>  just have to make sure I work with Jen tomorrow morning to get that filed with the clerk's office. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1454.904">And</a>  then from there, I'll confer with the three commissioner subcommittee, and then we'll set up a Zoom meeting with the homeowners. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1464.447">OK?</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1465.407">Wonderful.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1466.007">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1466.928">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1472.009">Jennifer</a>  Keenan, are you? <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1474.655">On</a>  this meeting still, if not, I'll text it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1483.978">I'm</a>  going to wait for Jen to come back. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1485.879">In</a>  the meantime, we can start our discussion of the next agenda item, which is the determination of significance for the CPC project for City Hall. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1498.143">So</a>  that's Teresa. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1501.18">Hello.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1501.56">Um,</a>  so I sent out earlier, uh, to all the commissioners, the MHC inventory form for city hall. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1510.587">I</a>  believe Teresa wants to talk to us about what those projects are that are being planned for the building. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1515.551">Um,</a>  I think that those will have an impact on the project. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1519.974">So.</a> </p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1522.336">Hello,</a>  good evening, everybody. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1523.837">I'm</a>  the community preservation act manager for the city of Medford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1528.562">We</a>  have an application before us from the facilities department at City Hall to do some upgrades to the bathroom. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1536.309">They're</a>  using the criteria of historic preservation as the building we feel is historically significant. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1545.216">So</a>  tonight, as part of the funding, we would require a determination of significance, a favorable <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1552.459">A</a>  determinant of significance from the local historical commission to be used in our consideration of the application. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1559.125">So,</a>  tonight, I'm here to ask this body to please consider city hall to be a building of significance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1567.873">And</a>  I'm happy to answer any questions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1569.214">I</a>  will stop talking.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1574.107">So</a>  I have a question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1574.907">So</a>  is the plan to, it's probably a combination of ADA, MAS 521 CMR upgrades, which is all handicap accessibility, but also some reconfiguration of the bathrooms to probably optimize them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1591.953">But</a>  the plan is to kind of preserve and maintain all the ornate finishes within as best as possible.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1598.656">As</a>  much as possible. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1601.177">There</a>  have been some <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1604.215">I</a>  wouldn't say poor renovations done, but haphazard perhaps might be the better term from what they originally were to where they are now for us to at least have an handicapped accessible stall. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1616.725">However,</a>  it does not meet requirements from the ADA. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1621.369">This</a>  is the first phase of what we hope to see as a multiple phase project where we would first make those ADA improvements to the public facilities. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1633.459">And</a>  then in a perhaps a later year, they would that's whenever reconfiguration each back. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1641.452">those</a>  type of upgrades would be made. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1643.033">Ryan,</a>  looks like you have a question.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1644.673">I</a>  do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1645.153">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1645.414">So</a>  it's going to roll into the right next logical question, which is what has the city done for an assessment on the entire building, including a space needs assessment for all the departments and various upgrades, you know, the exterior envelope? <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1660.68">I</a>  know we went through a series of restorations, but if there's a complete plan somewhere that the city is referencing, <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1666.522">great,</a>  but if there's not, perhaps now would be an optimal time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1669.803">For</a>  example, I can see maintaining the historic integrity of some of the bathrooms, maybe perhaps on the most public floors, but then there's an opportunity to certainly renovate other spaces in the building to consolidate those poor, quote unquote, poor renovations into something that's a little bit more spectacular for the inhabitants of City Hall, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1691.891">So</a>  the buildings are, is well used and we wanna make sure that it's, <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1696.193">up</a>  to par so i'm just curious if there's an assessment on those spaces or even just like for example an assessment on all the public spaces you know and all the needs for accessibility etc i know you guys are doing something with the elevator as well so i'm sure there's something but yes um to the best of my knowledge which i'm i'm</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1719.066">I</a>  tried to be involved with everything, but I don't know everything. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1722.99">To</a>  the best of my knowledge, I don't believe a conditions assessment or a feasibility study or just an assessment in general of City Hall has happened. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1732.501">About</a>  18 months ago, I think it was, is when we hired the first facilities director for the city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1740.086">So</a>  that could be a project that could be happening that I'm just not aware of. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1744.068">However,</a>  as the Facilities Director is the one applying for this funding to upgrade the bathrooms, I'm sure he would have mentioned that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1752.231">So</a>  I don't want to say no, but I believe the answer is no, an assessment has not been done. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1756.773">We</a>  have looked at individual properties across the city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1762.356">A</a>  conversation about the Curtis Tufts School comes to mind, trying to look at an assessment for that building. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1771.79">But</a>  yes, unfortunately, to the best of my knowledge, I believe the answer is no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1775.956">That</a>  has not happened yet. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1778.28">That</a>  could be something the CTA could consider.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1783.539">Yeah,</a>  I think our, for me, for me, the, my, and I'm sure maybe Peter might chime in and Doug, if he were here, and he eventually will chime in through the CPC. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1795.244">I</a>  think 1 of the things that we will ask for as part of this is funding. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1800.767">The</a>  work is taking a step. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1803.808">backwards</a>  and at least assessing the entire building. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1807.672">I</a>  know there's been various things been done to assess the envelope and assess the roof structure because there's the <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1818.487">I</a>  wanna say satellites, it's not satellites. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1820.268">The</a>  solar panels are on top of the roof. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1822.009">So,</a>  you know, I know various things have been done, but I think a comprehend, you know, just like every other building that we look at, like the cemetery complex or the fire stations, I think this building really deserves a complex view headed by an architectural team that's gonna not just look at the bathrooms, but gonna give the city an assessment of all the projects that need to be done. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1842.002">Good</a>  time for all the departments to chime in and figure out what they need for space and, <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1846.325">if</a>  there's any reconfiguration, and then give a dollar amount to not just the CPC, but the entire city, knowing what the taxpayers are going to pay, and then prioritize, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1856.41">So</a>  if the bathrooms are the most important thing that needs to be done right here and now, then great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1861.453">But</a>  at least they have the plan then to back it up and know what also is coming.</p>

    <p>[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1865.575">Yeah,</a>  almost like a master plan. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1869.397">Yep.</a> </p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1870.577">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1871.678">I</a>  would say that's an incredibly fair point. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1874.951">kind</a>  of upset that perhaps I didn't think of that first. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1877.253">So</a>  thank you, Ryan. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1878.674">But</a>  that's something I can absolutely bring back. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1881.016">And</a>  we could even make that a condition of our funding is that prior to or within a certain amount of time frame from this funding, you must conduct an assessment of at least City Hall with the intention of all buildings. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1899.833">It</a>  comes down to a matter of funding. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1903.752">As</a>  to why that hasn't happened yet and, as you mentioned, we can outsource this to consultants who can do the work. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1910.298">So</a>  it's not. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1911.579">You</a>  know, it's super taxing on the little limited staff that we have. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1916.764">Would</a>  you make that a condition of this? <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1919.639">Determination</a>  of significance?</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1922.0">Not</a>  a determination of significance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1923.501">I</a>  think the significance is the significance, but it's going to be our recommendation as part of the official role of reviewing CPC projects is going to request that the CPC make that a condition of funding.</p>

    <p>[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1936.688">I</a>  just wanted to clarify what I said about master plan. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1939.81">I</a>  didn't mean for the entire city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1942.612">I</a>  meant more just for this building.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1945.802">Yeah,</a>  I mean, we can take it on a building by building basis. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1949.224">I</a>  think the city's well on its way, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1951.365">So</a>  I'm sure the schools have something because they're newer buildings and the fire department has something. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1957.447">Police</a>  department's a new building. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1958.948">So</a>  it's being done in bits and bobs. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1961.269">It's</a>  just a matter of somebody. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1962.41">So</a>  I think this is a standalone project just all in itself. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1967.992">You</a>  know, it's deserving. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1969.453">So,</a>  you know, I can roll into the history of the building, but it definitely is, in my opinion, deserving of funding. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1979.242">Did</a>  everybody have a chance to review the form? <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1983.165">Does</a>  anybody want to kickstart comments?</p>

    <p>[Jennifer Keenan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1986.248">I'll</a>  make a motion to fine for significance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1988.89">Great,</a>  Jen. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1993.294">I'll</a>  second.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=1997.03">Uh,</a>  Lenny got a second. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2000.514">Sorry,</a>  Ed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2001.636">All</a>  right, Jen, if you want to start.</p>

    <p>[Jennifer Keenan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2004.74">Sure,</a>  um. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2007.284">I</a>  think this is a pretty slam dunk case of significance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2012.123">Oh,</a>  no, I was thinking that we had already determined significance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2014.424">We</a>  just didn't write a letter, but that was something else. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2017.964">I</a>  mean, obviously, it's, you know, kind of our shining beacon in the city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2022.786">It</a>  has the beautiful rotunda. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2024.966">It's</a>  been recommended for a National Register listing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2029.727">So</a>  to me, it's kind of a no-brainer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2032.188">I</a>  don't really feel like it warrants massive amounts of discussion.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2039.81">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2040.79">Hannah</a>  Lenny?</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2042.936">I</a>  mean, I think this is an easy one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2044.658">It</a>  is obviously significant historically and architecturally. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2049.586">And</a>  yeah, I don't really have much to add.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2054.152">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2054.813">Peter,</a>  anything to add? <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2056.536">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2057.537">And</a>  Ed?</p>

    <p>[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2058.752">classic</a>  piece of WPA Medford significance.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2061.554">Yeah,</a>  it's like one of the three beacons, this and former DPW building, Chevalier, Post Office, all the projects here in Medford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2071.16">Yeah,</a>  I just want to note for anybody watching at home, <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2075.022">more</a>  watching this project. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2076.504">This</a>  is a building built by Michael A. Dyer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2079.506">Michael</a>  Dyer is one of the most prolific architect builders in the city of Medford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2083.309">He,</a>  in fact, at one point probably had done most of the municipal projects in the 1930s. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2089.194">I</a>  believe he or his father served as a one-time city mayor, so it's very important. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2098.721">He</a>  did take this design elsewhere. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2101.303">Woburn</a>  City Hall looks almost identical to this building, but our building was first, so we'd like to think that he designed our building first and took the design elsewhere. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2111.831">And</a>  it really, inside and out, maintains a lot of integrity. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2115.274">There's</a>  a lot of cool features to this building, from the hallways to the <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2121.438">offices</a>  and certainly the auditorium space and even the clock tower is kind of nice. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2131.441">And</a>  it sits upon what is later known as Medford Town Common. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2135.862">It</a>  was the municipal center for Medford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2137.803">Unlike</a>  an 18th century common, this is more, it started off as a gravel pit and then <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2143.464">became</a>  a public park and is now home to our city hall after much fanfare, much debate on what to do with it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2151.989">And</a>  the city of Medford, 16 years before building this building, tore down their town hall without a plan. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2158.713">So</a>  I'd like to see not that happen and not have a plan for this building. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2165.397">So</a>  yeah, so that's just my thoughts. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2170.882">All</a>  right, with anybody else, with nobody else here and nobody else having comments, I'll take a roll call vote. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2178.387">Motion</a>  was for significance, so Jen? <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2182.929">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2184.65">And</a>  Eleni?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2186.411">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2187.652">And</a>  Ed? <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2189.173">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2190.334">And</a>  Peter?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2191.214">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2191.975">All</a>  right, motion passes for nothing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2195.757">So</a>  we'll get a letter out to you.</p>

    <p>[Jennifer Keenan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2199.619">Fantastic,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2201.798">Thank</a>  you, Teresa. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2205.259">Well,</a>  since we have you, Teresa, and I think you had sent around the email about the quadrennial, I'm butchering that, quadrennial ideas. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2220.866">Quadricennial.</a> </p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2222.406">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Jennifer Keenan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2223.006">Oh,</a>  I think I put it wrong on the agenda. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2228.596">This</a>  is our next agenda item, not to steal that from Ryan.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2232.217">No,</a>  go ahead.</p>

    <p>[Jennifer Keenan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2234.178">I</a>  know that you had sent an email back a while back and then Doug reminded me that we needed to talk about this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2244.881">This</a>  is the city's 100th anniversary.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2251.203">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2252.363">I</a>  know some people have been bringing this to us like, well, that's still six years away. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2259.27">6</a>  years ago was way too long. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2261.992">So</a>  time will go quickly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2263.552">So</a>  I just wanted to get this at least started to be talked about so that it's not a mad dash at the end to start pulling something together. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2271.276">I</a>  don't know if I had circulated an ideas list of how this could be celebrated through, or it was just the idea of, hey, we should start planning this.</p>

    <p>[Jennifer Keenan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2282.536">I</a>  don't know that I've seen an ideas list, but I'd be curious. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2286.238">Yeah,</a>  what the ideas are, are we going to pull a committee together to like a formal committee.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2292.321">Fundraise</a>  is going to be money in the city budget.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2297.564">Yeah,</a>  and that's another reason why we're talking about it now is budgeting purposes, but I'm. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2304.12">I</a>  believe that we should hold together a committee and whether that is a representative from the Historical Commission, maybe CPC, maybe from the Treasury. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2317.47">I</a>  forgot what their fiscal task force or something like that, but having the right players as well as community member volunteers to serve the board as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2328.422">We</a>  would love to have the Anderson's on the things like that, but that was my initial thought was put together a committee of established members as well as new volunteers to really start. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2339.549">I</a>  don't know if we tag team with the historical commission society, but. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2345.673">Lots</a>  of ideas, I don't know what what. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2349.289">You</a>  may have kicked around, but we should form a committee, I think, with five to seven members. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2357.591">Maybe</a>  we can bring in Tufts. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2359.011">I'm</a>  just spitballing at this point. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2360.571">I</a>  wasn't prepared.</p>

    <p>[Jennifer Keenan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2363.172">I</a>  think the committee is going to need a budget, which is always a challenge. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2370.453">Yeah,</a>  I definitely think a mix of city stakeholders, commission members, <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2375.726">residents,</a>  anybody that's potentially interested, Chamber of Commerce. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2382.889">I</a>  always think of the commission, I always think of like, we're the B2B and the Chamber of Commerce is the consumer facing, like they're in charge of parades and things like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2398.276">But</a>  I think for an event like this, <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2401.257">I</a>  think kind of a united front would be fun and you know not we don't typically kind of get involved with those things but I think it would be fun to be involved this time with such a big thing and I don't know maybe <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2418.69">Ryan,</a>  we can use it as a way to like celebrate our oldest buildings or highlight some of our oldest buildings, a walking tour, or I'm sure we could come up with some like events. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2432.236">Yeah,</a>  or just like, you know, depending on what it is, is it a year's worth of events? <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2438.859">Is</a>  it a certain couple, you know, concentrated timeframe worth of events? <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2443.441">Like,</a>  are we celebrating it for the whole year? <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2446.542">Like,</a>  do we know the actual date?</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2449.485">One,</a>  I don't know, it was sometimes like the formal charter came years later.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2457.772">After</a>  I thought I thought it was sometime in the spring.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2461.946">It's</a>  April, but I don't know when the specific grants came in, because there's the grant to Matthew Craddock, which is 162930, and then there's our founding, which we were not a community formally until like 1680. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2478.153">So,</a>  in terms of Massachusetts government, but there was representation <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2489.779">Because</a>  we're listed in many, many government things as meat for or mystic. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2495.326">So</a>  we can do some research and that will be some of the things that we lead up to is making sure that all the facts are correct. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2503.476">Yeah,</a>  I think if every organization does 1 or 2 events. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2506.36">throughout</a>  the year, then, you know, there'd be enough to fill out a year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2510.481">You</a>  know, I think the city should, you know, we could be responsible for two, like I've done at a researcher house programs. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2517.583">We</a>  can do walking tours. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2519.003">That's</a>  not a problem. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2520.303">Historical</a>  society did a couple of programs focused on various aspects of Medford history. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2526.285">Maybe</a>  they, maybe the, it might be cool to do the history of the, <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2531.147">The</a>  1930s celebration 100 years ago, and the way that they sell, you know, Lexington was just looking at their centennial and the way that they celebrated the bicentennial and all of that 100 years ago. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2542.738">So</a>  that might be fun. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2543.619">You</a>  know, because that's recent history. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2546.982">We</a>  definitely the city should be responsible for an event a big event, like a big mystic river celebration, but maybe. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2555.75">rather</a>  than do those events separately or even at all, combine them all into one big mega event with people and music and all sorts of stuff. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2567.993">Or</a>  do it a couple of times a year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2569.113">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2569.973">There</a>  should definitely be a parade and there should definitely be fireworks.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2574.294">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2576.194">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2577.094">I</a>  kind of flushed out like we should have something <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2580.592">Um,</a>  every month and dovetail existing things, like, I had waited, like, the state picnic, like, that's something that already happens. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2588.816">Now,</a>  maybe we can, like, oomph it up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2591.438">So,</a>  I don't know if it's so much, like, lots and lots of new event planning. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2597.981">It's</a>  a couple of new events peppered into pre-existing, you know, community anchor events.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2606.045">Yeah,</a>  I just looked it up too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2611.649">2027</a>  is the 175th anniversary of Tufts University. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2614.732">So</a>  I would like to think that they will start celebrating themselves a little bit before that or leading up to that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2622.017">If</a>  not, that would be a good kickoff, real rock solid kickoff way to start celebrating Med for 400 is to start with one of the oldest institutions in the area. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2631.844">So</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2633.809">and</a>  a good way to partner with Tufts. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2637.152">Tufts</a>  has a lot of students, alumni, good way for Medford to maybe raise money and, you know, find ways to bring the kids into the programs, but also get something out of Tufts too as well.</p>

    <p>[Jennifer Keenan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2648.663">Yeah,</a>  and are they like bringing alumni, like famous alumni back for their celebration? <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2652.968">It</a>  could be a way to get some like- Money. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2655.73">Famous</a>  people to Medford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2659.135">Has,</a>  did you guys, did Townsend ever do anything, Ryan, when you were there? <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2663.957">Did</a>  they ever have one of these anniversaries?</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2665.717">I</a>  mean, they've had these anniversaries before. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2669.258">I</a>  did not. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2670.519">COVID</a>  happened in the middle of our big one, so.</p>

    <p>[Jennifer Keenan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2673.56">Well,</a>  and all the events right now are, like in Lexington, are leading up to Patriot's Day next year, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2681.442">Like</a>  they have their big countdown in the Senate. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2683.463">I</a>  drive through there every day on my way to my office.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2687.063">Yes,</a>  it's the 250th anniversary has started.</p>

    <p>[Jennifer Keenan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2690.445">I</a>  mean, a countdown, like, I don't know if you've seen what Lexington's doing, Teresa. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2695.327">They</a>  have like a big countdown board on their town green. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2699.51">I'll</a>  try to snap a picture of it when I drive through there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2703.872">In</a>  front of Town Hall, they're counting down to their big celebration.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2708.434">Very</a>  cool.</p>

    <p>[Jennifer Keenan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2710.992">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2711.833">I</a>  mean, I think like the city, the city of Boston, they're, they're 400 the same as ours, if I'm not mistaken, I think 1630. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2718.818">So</a>  they already have like a logo and they're already putting their marketing out there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2726.064">So,</a>  and I know they have Boston money. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2727.806">We</a>  do not, but you know, I think it's time for us to really start focusing in on this one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2733.11">And</a>  I think it starts with a committee of, as you said, Jen, you know, bring in, <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2738.178">chamber</a>  of historical society, bring in city folks, bring in, you know, just historical consultants who live in the area. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2744.599">It'd</a>  be really great to have clear density there, you know, um, and then kind of go from there, establish a wants desires of, of types of events. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2755.201">And</a>  then from there we can establish a budget. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2757.962">So</a>  it sounds like this is the, uh, the commission supporting this, which is great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2764.043">Um,</a>  I'm a bit of a party planner, event production, <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2768.995">planner</a>  by a former profession, so this is something that's exciting to me.</p>

    <p>[Jennifer Keenan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2777.177">Yeah,</a>  I think it could be super fun.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2780.298">Yeah,</a>  in terms of next steps, I'm happy to reach out and I passed this briefly past the mayor, so I think she'd be open to having a discussion about this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2791.121">So</a>  I'll bring it to her attention and then get her blessing to start pulling <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2797.375">personalities</a>  together for the committee?</p>

    <p>[Jennifer Keenan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2801.636">Yeah,</a>  that sounds good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2802.476">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2804.016">Yeah,</a>  I mean, because there's like, we have the Brooks Estate, you know, there's Embelle, there's the Royal House, there's, you know, I mean, everything kind of overlaps with the society a little bit, but I think it's just a matter of how big is the committee and who, you know, like, you know, like, for example, like, <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2825.438">You</a>  know there's me like I sit here and I am on mbelt and then Doug's on CPC and he's on mbelt and like I think there's a fee, you know, and then obviously we're members of societies like it, it all kind of overlaps a little bit.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2839.525">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2840.205">Yeah,</a>  I'll see what the mayor may have. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2842.566">She</a>  may have preference in seeing more chamber folks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2845.828">I'm</a>  not sure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2846.328">It's</a>  just to kind of help share the <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2849.142">The</a>  labor, this is going to be a lot of work.</p>

    <p>[Jennifer Keenan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2851.764">Yeah,</a>  and I think you need to determine who's driving it, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2856.088">Is</a>  it the chamber? <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2857.329">Is</a>  it the society? <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2859.611">Is</a>  it somebody? <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2861.032">City</a>  hall. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2861.713">Is</a>  it, right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2862.373">Is</a>  it some, Alicia or somebody on her team? <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2865.116">Like</a>  whatever. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2868.038">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2868.539">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2868.799">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2869.119">So</a>  my eyes get really big. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2875.47">But</a>  I think starting with the mayor more earnestly in this conversation is the next step. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2881.092">So</a>  I will do that and happy to come back and report out to this group or just provide like an administrative memo to keep you updated.</p>

    <p>[Jennifer Keenan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2888.416">Yeah,</a>  keep us updated. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2890.216">And</a>  you're right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2892.858">I</a>  mean, the time is going to fly by. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2894.838">So</a>  the sooner, you know, at least the committee gets formed, I think the better. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2900.061">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2902.642">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2903.502">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2903.902">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2906.513">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jennifer Keenan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2908.655">Do</a>  we have any more new business? <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2913.258">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2915.14">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2916.201">Moving</a>  on to old business. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2919.944">Properties</a>  under demo delay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2922.186">We</a>  did hear from 56 Wareham Street today. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2926.229">I</a>  think we still need a little work on those plans, but I think the goal is to try to get them <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2935.045">done</a>  soon so that we can vote to lift them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2939.487">Ryan</a>  was gonna send them back a note. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2941.429">Or</a>  were you gonna send that to Doug and- I'm gonna send it to Doug and Peter.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2944.511">They</a>  didn't really change anything. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2946.092">I</a>  asked them to push back the addition a little bit, but they didn't do anything, so.</p>

    <p>[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2950.734">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2954.997">Were</a>  the plans any less diagrammatic kind of?</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2959.757">Uh,</a>  yeah, yeah, I think they were before this was um, this was uh, This is not almond street almond street. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2969.162">We</a>  haven't even we got to set up a meeting with them.</p>

    <p>[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2971.563">Oh,</a>  wait. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2972.223">Yeah,</a>  okay I'm getting i'm getting mixed up.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2976.705">I</a>  think yeah anyway Yeah, no, I think where ham is pretty concise. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2981.747">I</a>  just asked them to <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2984.138">push</a>  back the roof line a little bit so that it doesn't look like it's eating the old house, but they didn't. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2991.68">So</a>  I'm not thrilled with it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2994.621">So</a>  the rest of it looks fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2996.021">I</a>  just, that's the only thing I want them to change.</p>

    <p>[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2997.742">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=2999.682">You</a>  know, it should be, you know, a rehabilitation, not necessarily restoration, but also not necessarily development either. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3007.805">So.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3013.659">All</a>  right, so next month, Jen.</p>

    <p>[Jennifer Keenan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3015.481">OK,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3019.244">OK,</a>  and yeah, and we have not heard from all months, so. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3025.169">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3026.81">I</a>  don't think we need to order any foreign bees tonight.</p>

    <p>[MCM00001222_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3030.073">OK,</a>  so we're there if one just. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3036.518">161</a>  Maine went into open house this weekend and I did walk through. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3042.545">Unless</a>  they're going to raise the roof, it's never going to come back to us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3047.129">The</a>  interior is in very good shape. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3052.413">It</a>  was modernized for renewal a few years ago. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3055.675">It</a>  was being used as an income property, and it's being sold as either a starter home or an income property at 715 Asking. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3063.941">So</a>  if we had ordered a Form B, I don't think it's going to be <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3069.224">Again,</a>  absent a raised roof, which given the shape, it's not going to go that far. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3073.529">I</a>  doubt it's ever going to come before us, at least on this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3077.314">What?</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3077.815">I</a>  was going to say it's covered in asbestos siding, so we have to do some sort of remediation if they decide to do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3086.333">Otherwise</a>  it'll just look wonky. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3087.594">I</a>  guess they could go over it with vinyl, but that's such a did we already order one for that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3092.397">I</a>  haven't ordered it yet, because I preemptively just sitting on it waiting to make sure that budget doesn't burn that we don't burn through our budget.</p>

    <p>[Jennifer Keenan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3098.401">Yeah,</a>  I mean, I mean, I agree with Ed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3100.883">I</a>  mean, it's it's almost in too good of shape to. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3103.744">I</a>  don't know that it's a super threat, but yeah, I think maybe keep it on the list and if if you know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3109.508">If</a>  March comes in March and April come and we have a little extra, we can order it.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3116.225">Yeah,</a>  exactly.</p>

    <p>[Jennifer Keenan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3117.006">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3121.728">And</a>  I haven't heard or seen, we haven't gotten any pings this month about kind of new things coming in, so.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3129.814">If</a>  people see derelict properties and they want to bring them to our attention, you know, feel free to, you know, if you walk by something and say, hey, this condition isn't looking too favorable, maybe you should take a look at it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3140.1">You</a>  know, we're happy to do that.</p>

    <p>[Jennifer Keenan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3142.061">Yeah,</a>  and there haven't been any like, <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3145.344">attention</a>  developers. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3147.426">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3149.908">I</a>  mean, there was one I don't I'll send it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3153.552">We'll</a>  look at it, Ryan. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3154.693">There</a>  was one that came on last week. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3158.577">But</a>  everything that I've seen in the past couple weeks, <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3163.064">If</a>  it's shouting for a developer, it's because there's an extra lot or something buildable potentially that I don't know that it's necessarily a demo or teardown. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3174.894">It's</a>  just adding something to something that's already there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3178.156">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3183.441">Speaking</a>  of budgets, are we?</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3185.042">We're</a>  okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3187.644">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3187.865">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3188.585">We're</a>  on our pace. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3191.072">Yeah,</a>  I'm going to put out to bid. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3195.615">I</a>  have to review after we do the S&P. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3200.057">Eleni</a>  and I are going to review what they call the scope of work, which is normally what we do for MHC's grant, but MHC didn't <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3209.923">We</a>  didn't apply for an M.H.C. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3211.085">grant</a>  last year because we missed the deadline. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3213.327">So</a>  we're doing that work and we have a section picked out that's going to be the Sagamore Vale, which is Ashland, Water, Oakland street area. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3224.22">The</a>  consultants were pretty convinced that <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3228.042">I</a>  think 50 or so properties could be documented for the money that we have in our budget, which is $15,000 for that match. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3235.846">So</a>  we'll have to work and we will have to go out to bid. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3239.848">But</a>  I just want to review scope of work after the S&P grant goes out.</p>

    <p>[Jennifer Keenan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3246.471">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3247.791">OK,</a>  good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3251.847">Permit</a>  subcommittee, I sent a couple of things to Peter and Eleni this week, so thank you guys for getting back to me on that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3258.288">I'm</a>  actually going to meet with the building department on Wednesday. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3262.449">They</a>  have a meeting every week. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3264.549">I've</a>  been invited to come go sit with them and just kind of answer any questions, get to know them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3271.17">They</a>  can know me, see I'm a real person. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3273.571">If</a>  there's anything that you guys want me to relay, <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3281.935">Let</a>  me know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3282.475">I</a>  think I'm just going to kind of go over, you know, kind of talk generally about the things that... Should we start putting our business card back in the office? <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3293.422">Oh,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3294.883">Do</a>  you have a stack of them?</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3296.284">I</a>  do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3296.784">I</a>  have all the boxes of them.</p>

    <p>[Jennifer Keenan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3299.246">I</a>  mean, I don't know how many people go in anymore. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3301.507">I</a>  mean, all the permits are gone by now.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3303.388">Lots</a>  of people. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3304.169">No,</a>  they do, but... Lots of people go in.</p>

    <p>[Jennifer Keenan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3307.01">Well,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3307.491">I</a>  mean, all right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3307.951">Well,</a>  I'll come grab some of those from you and bring them with me, but...</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3311.611">Um,</a>  just because then the guys will go, the guys will go, Oh, contact the historical commission and they'll go, how do I do that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3317.653">And</a>  you can say, here's the card.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3320.714">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3321.234">They,</a>  they, they do tend to send folks just right upstairs to Dennis and if he's available. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3327.076">So</a>  it might be a nice addition to have them if you have some. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3330.157">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3331.417">Do</a>  you want me to, uh, you want me to drop off a stack to you guys too, as well?</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3336.118">Yeah,</a>  that, that would be great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3337.459">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jennifer Keenan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3339.212">I</a>  mean, my goal is to just kind of talk in general about the things that we really look for, about streetscape and changing roof lines, honoring what's there, things in the rear we typically aren't super concerned about. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3363.528">you</a>  know, as long as the house kind of maintains what was there and what is there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3371.436">And</a>  I thought, Ryan, I'd bring that old memo that we wrote that kind of started this whole thing back, you know, what is a four or five years ago now, the examples that we had. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3383.747">And</a>  this is from previous commissioners, previous, you know, folks in the department. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3390.028">where</a>  it was just kind of like willy nilly of, of tearing things down and, and just, you know, anyway, I thought going to kind of just sharing a little history, uh, would kind of put us in, in context of how we got here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3404.793">But,</a>  um, anyway, if, if, if anything comes up between now and Wednesday four o'clock that you guys feel is important that I talk to them about, feel free to send it to me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3416.618">Otherwise,</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3418.659">Going</a>  into the lion's den.</p>

    <p>[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3424.904">Good</a>  luck.</p>

    <p>[Jennifer Keenan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3426.165">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3427.345">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3427.786">If</a>  anyone wants to come, feel free to come with me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3433.29">But</a>  no, I think it'd be fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3434.811">I</a>  tease. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3436.312">I</a>  mean, they're all good guys. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3439.454">One</a>  of the things that I struggle with is <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3443.218">Lands</a>  right literally sometimes there's things like sketched on a napkin and like taking a picture and upload it into the system and you know I would like to hear from them in the sense of. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3455.384">Yes,</a>  these are acceptable no they aren't. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3460.067">And</a>  what do they look for, because I think that that would be. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3464.449">You</a>  know, obviously, I'm not a contractor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3466.691">I</a>  don't know building codes, but, you know, what is the property owner required to do? <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3473.297">Because</a>  I feel like sometimes we get something to review and it's like. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3477.607">I</a>  mean, Eleni and Peter, you see it more, because I'll send you guys things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3480.509">And</a>  I'm like, there's nothing here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3482.169">I</a>  don't know what you're doing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3484.531">Even</a>  today, there was something I had to kind of send a note back on, because it said, we're putting a cover on and then making storage. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3495.196">And</a>  there was no other information about that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3497.797">And</a>  I'm like, can you just clarify what this is and where in the property? <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3500.999">Is</a>  this inside, outside? <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3503.28">What's</a>  happening here in terms of the work? <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3506.322">Because</a>  it's probably something we don't care about, but. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3509.845">You</a>  know, I don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3511.366">Are</a>  you tearing down a carriage house like it was so ambiguous? <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3516.831">So</a>  anyway, so I will let you guys know how that goes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3523.276">Ryan</a>  Cross Street Cemetery.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3526.118">Yeah,</a>  Teresa, are you there? <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3529.621">Perchance</a>  I am. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3531.968">Have</a>  we heard back from Fiona on where she is with the contract with PAL?</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3538.892">Yes,</a>  she and I connected last week. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3541.533">She</a>  said that she hopes to send this out early this week. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3545.155">I</a>  gave her today. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3546.035">I'm</a>  not going to nudge her tomorrow.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3548.076">And</a>  that's the contract, not necessarily the bidding work, or does that also include the bidding work?</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3557.021">I</a>  believe the bidding work was already pushed out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3560.142">Oh,</a>  OK. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3563.511">Responses</a>  she told me she was thought out mid last week. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3567.654">So</a>  I really bad advertiser for 2 weeks and maybe mid next week on the bidding aspect, but the contract. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3575.178">I'll</a>  get it out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3575.799">I'll</a>  make sure it gets out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3577.36">Okay,</a>  before I leave for vacation.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3580.161">Okay,</a>  so there you have it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3583.733">She</a>  knew everything that I knew. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3584.814">So</a>  yeah, so thanks for letting me know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3589.235">So</a>  I'm yeah, so I'm looking forward to getting PAO under contract so that we can then get moving on that work and then they have to apply for the state level permitting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3603.402">Then</a>  there's going to be some. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3606.403">uh</a>  lag time while they put together their report to the state if the state has any questions there'll be some additional lag time and then we will hopefully be going in the ground so</p>

    <p>[Jennifer Keenan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3616.316">Will</a>  they do that in the winter or will we automatically be delayed to like March?</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3622.32">I</a>  don't have an answer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3623.581">I</a>  would like to think that as long as they can excavate so just so people know for construction purposes, you can probably dig safely well into January and not hit any sort of frost in the ground. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3638.19">It</a>  makes it hairy to pour foundations, but you can definitely go in the ground. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3641.672">The</a>  ground is still soft. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3642.773">It's</a>  not fully frozen until. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3645.843">almost</a>  late January, early February. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3648.243">So</a>  those are really the months. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3650.424">So</a>  we don't get in ground by, I would say, Christmas. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3654.745">There'll</a>  be a low for the holiday and we won't be getting in the ground until April. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3659.026">I</a>  don't know how that impacts the RFP process that's gone out on the parcels, but my understanding is that the RFP is just to seek a development proposal, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3674.378">Is</a>  it a single, I didn't look at it yet, I probably should, but is it a singular proposal for each parcel or is it the whole concept?</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3683.723">I</a>  believe it's a concept plan that they're asking for, but don't hold me to that, that's my understanding.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3691.387">Okay,</a>  so we'll be looking at various proposals from various teams on what could or could not go there and the city can certainly pick and choose and then they'll <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3702.908">figure</a>  out what they want.</p>

    <p>[8Sqy8gyjolU_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3703.869">Is</a>  this for the downtown project?</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3709.551">This</a>  is the downtown archaeological dig at the former cemetery parcel as it relates to the development proposal that went out.</p>

    <p>[Jennifer Keenan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3718.596">Or</a>  the parking lot parcel.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3720.157">Yeah,</a>  that is sparking a hot topic on parking in the city of Medford right now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3725.28">So.</a> </p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3727.401">That</a>  it is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3729.992">I</a>  was just going to add that that's also my understanding of excavation work. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3735.834">That's</a>  that timeline that Ryan presented. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3738.095">I</a>  had heard until February, but I think we're about a mile out there.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3743.177">I</a>  mean, as long as the excavator can get through. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3744.918">But</a>  I think it's a question of whether or not it's an ideal condition for the archaeologists and digging excavation.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3752.241">That</a>  was going to be my concern, too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3754.341">Yeah,</a>  if the ground is great enough for us to peel back that top layer, <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3760.78">Yeah,</a>  so a concern there as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3763.962">But</a>  the contract is going to get out, so at least that triggers the timeline that you presented out, Ryan.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3771.005">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3771.525">That's</a>  why we'll get it out this week.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3773.486">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3775.586">Okey-dokey.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jennifer Keenan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3776.947">All</a>  right, Thomas Brooks Park, we have a public meeting on the calendar for October 22nd. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3784.802">So</a>  commissioners, if you are available and would love to join us, we're going to be reviewing the project to date with the public. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3794.206">Peter</a>  is going to talk about the archaeological cap ideas that we had already discussed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3800.428">kind</a>  of just give folks a general update and take any questions, feedback, et cetera. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3806.333">Did</a>  I miss anything, Ryan, on that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3808.114">It's</a>  going to be on Zoom. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3810.316">Just</a>  to make it easier, we could not get the, the library is booked every night this month. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3815.48">So</a>  we could not get the room at the library. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3817.781">So</a>  Zoom it is.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3819.463">Everything,</a>  everywhere.</p>

    <p>[Jennifer Keenan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3821.244">Oh</a>  my God, it's bananas.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3822.845">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jennifer Keenan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3825.467">It's</a>  all good though. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3826.168">There's</a>  lots of good things happening here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3829.332">So</a>  anyway, so that'll be an exciting meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3831.553">And</a>  we should probably send out an email, Ryan.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3836.076">Is</a>  there a, Theresa, is there a process for a Captain Barry call?</p>

    <p>[Jennifer Keenan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3845.382">Oh</a>  yeah, can we get a representative?</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3846.883">Or</a>  a mayor call for that particular neighborhood, and we can just target the.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3851.906">Yep,</a>  yep, I can help facilitate that, but Steve's community is our director of communications. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3858.49">Um,</a>  he, he manages the robo calls and alerts. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3861.673">So.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3863.094">He</a>  would be feel free to send it to me and I can send it along to him, but in case I. Disappear hit by a bus, Steve can help with that.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3871.42">All</a>  right, I'll, I'll, I'll send that to you when I. Did we file a formal agenda Ryan? <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3880.204">That</a>  depends on I guess I could just file it.</p>

    <p>[Jennifer Keenan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3882.746">We</a>  probably should only because the last time we had a public meeting about the park. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3888.57">Somebody</a>  complained that they couldn't find it on the city calendar. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3891.612">I</a>  don't know if the agenda is the trigger point to getting on the calendar.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3899.438">You</a>  can have just the public. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3901.186">event,</a>  like if you go to the calendar right now, for instance, there's a great, uh, I'll plug a Hispanic pop-up restaurant that's happening this Friday, um, at the West Medford community center. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3911.113">So</a>  if you want your, your public community event, um, you can also send it again to speak community.</p>

    <p>[Jennifer Keenan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3918.358">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3918.658">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3919.098">I</a>  think, I mean, we have the zoom meeting, so we should at least have that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3922.881">So</a>  people can download it and have the zoom meeting info.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3926.043">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jennifer Keenan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3927.43">Yeah,</a>  OK, OK, all right, we can make that definitely make that happen. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3942.159">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3942.799">And</a>  then after that meeting, Ryan, what will our next steps be for finalize that plan and add it as an amendment to the master plan? <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3952.445">Right,</a>  OK.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3954.215">perhaps</a>  seek estimates for work, and then we are going to start the very long process of working with various city departments to bid all of the public work for Thomas Brooks Park Phase 2. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3968.643">Teresa</a>  will absolutely need your help, along with Fiona, because it will be a beast.</p>

    <p>[Theresa Dupont]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3977.167">Looking</a>  forward to it.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3980.4">I'm</a>  hoping that the various city departments that would be involved with this traffic and DPW and all those parks will have a lot of the tools that we need, basically standardized stuff that they're using across the city that we can then dump into a standard set of specifications. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=3999.45">So</a>  not reinventing the wheel. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=4002.651">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jennifer Keenan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=4007.417">Great,</a>  good updates there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=4011.239">Survey</a>  projects, you guys kind of already talked about that a little bit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=4014.481">We're</a>  going to put in for a new survey.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=4016.543">Yeah,</a>  Lenny, did you have a chance to review the, are you going to send me comments?</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=4024.127">I</a>  did, I just remembered that today. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=4026.909">I</a>  read through it and it seems pretty good for, you know, one pager and I guess when we submit the <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=4033.638">If</a>  we get asked to submit the larger application, I'd be happy to work with you on that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=4037.86">But</a>  I thought it looked good.</p>

    <p>[Jennifer Keenan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=4041.242">What</a>  does the one pager do?</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=4043.248">November</a>  15th, but I'm going to send it ASAP. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=4046.49">So</a>  it's, I just want to get it off my plate. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=4049.792">Yeah,</a>  it's a, that one we're looking to do the Hastings Heights neighborhood. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=4054.455">There's</a>  a huge gap in survey in West Medford between the Marm-Simons Historic District and West Medford Square. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=4061.439">Tons</a>  of pre-1900 buildings there that were developed, a large amount of them being single families. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=4067.702">So</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=4069.243">It'd</a>  be a great neighborhood to do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=4071.125">They've</a>  already previously approved the project. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=4074.508">So</a>  we're kind of going back and asking them again to just make sure that that's still a priority. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=4079.513">I'm</a>  hoping it is because this year the priorities are a little bit different as survey work is not their top priority. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=4084.377">It's</a>  actually planning, but we're a city that was in dire need of. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=4090.797">Inventory,</a>  so I'm kind of hoping that they'll prioritize that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=4094.718">Plus,</a>  we're executing a plan that's been well implemented over the last decade. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=4099.6">So</a>  I'm hoping that they'll see past that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=4102.461">Plus,</a>  we're a CLG, so we're usually guaranteed to get funding. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=4105.842">But</a>  if we don't, then we will move forward with a lesser dollar amount and just do other survey.</p>

    <p>[Jennifer Keenan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=4115.624">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=4116.725">It's</a>  exciting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=4117.205">It'll</a>  be nice to have a new project for that since we took this year off.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=4121.588">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=4122.288">Yep.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jennifer Keenan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=4122.728">Well,</a>  yeah, kind of. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=4124.209">We</a>  were forced to take this year off.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=4126.05">Well,</a>  we we are catching up, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=4127.892">So</a>  we're making sure that we're getting back on a normal schedule after COVID and all that stuff. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=4132.895">Plus,</a>  you know, and the budget won't get done. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=4136.017">We're</a>  just waiting for reimbursement from the state. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=4138.158">So.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jennifer Keenan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=4139.779">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=4142.199">Okay,</a>  does anybody else have anything for tonight before we approve the meeting minutes? <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=4150.726">No?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=4151.267">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=4152.067">Peter</a>  sent around the meeting minutes.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historical-commission-10-07-24&start=4155.05">Motion</a>  to approve.</p>
