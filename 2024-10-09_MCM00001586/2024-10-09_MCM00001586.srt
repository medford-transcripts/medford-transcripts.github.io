00:00:04,793 --> 00:00:05,834
[SPEAKER_12]: It is 703.

4
00:00:06,534 --> 00:00:08,415
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to call the meeting to order.

5
00:00:08,435 --> 00:00:11,136
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I just realized.

6
00:00:11,696 --> 00:00:14,737
[SPEAKER_12]: Commissioners, if everybody could relabel themselves.

7
00:00:15,638 --> 00:00:16,358
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, here's Ed.

8
00:00:16,938 --> 00:00:17,999
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, change of plans.

9
00:00:29,842 --> 00:00:30,063
[SPEAKER_12]: See?

10
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:31,306
[SPEAKER_12]: One second, everybody.

11
00:00:31,326 --> 00:00:31,948
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks.

12
00:00:32,028 --> 00:00:32,308
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, Ed.

13
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:49,426
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, let me get started with our little phrase here to get going with the meeting.

14
00:00:50,928 --> 00:00:53,992
[SPEAKER_12]: So again, Medford Historical Commission, today is Monday, October 7th.

15
00:00:54,473 --> 00:01:01,562
[SPEAKER_12]: Pursuant to Chapter 20 of the Acts of 2021, this meeting of the City of Medford Historical Commission will be conducted via remote means.

16
00:01:02,183 --> 00:01:07,586
[SPEAKER_12]: Members of the public who wish to access the meeting may do so by using the Zoom link provided for in the agenda.

17
00:01:08,307 --> 00:01:11,068
[SPEAKER_12]: No in-person attendance of members of the public will be permitted.

18
00:01:11,469 --> 00:01:15,891
[SPEAKER_12]: Public participation in any public hearing during this meeting shall be by remote means only.

19
00:01:15,911 --> 00:01:22,015
[SPEAKER_12]: Ed, are you there?

20
00:01:22,055 --> 00:01:23,196
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just making sure.

21
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,240
[SPEAKER_12]: Ed, can you hear me?

22
00:01:32,603 --> 00:01:34,904
[SPEAKER_04]: I can, but I'm trying to get myself up.

23
00:01:35,484 --> 00:01:38,725
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm having... No problem.

24
00:01:39,425 --> 00:01:41,626
[SPEAKER_12]: As long as you can hear us and we can hear you.

25
00:01:41,706 --> 00:01:44,206
[SPEAKER_12]: No, don't fret about your camera for the time being.

26
00:01:44,226 --> 00:01:45,046
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, sure.

27
00:01:45,667 --> 00:01:47,887
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, thanks.

28
00:01:48,087 --> 00:01:52,028
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, so up first tonight is 110 Brooke Street.

29
00:01:52,088 --> 00:01:54,269
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to have a preferably preserved hearing.

30
00:01:55,109 --> 00:02:01,151
[SPEAKER_12]: And at this point, Ryan, I'm going to turn the meeting over to you, and I'm going to recuse myself from this case.

31
00:02:03,372 --> 00:02:06,936
[SPEAKER_12]: And you guys are good because you have Eleni, Peter and Ed.

32
00:02:08,237 --> 00:02:13,002
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, I'm going to shut my camera off, mute myself and you can text me when it's ready to come back.

33
00:02:13,662 --> 00:02:13,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

34
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:15,044
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, thanks.

35
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:29,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to recap for the general public, the Historical Commission had a meeting last month where we determined 110 Brooks Street to be historically significant.

36
00:02:30,883 --> 00:02:44,270
[SPEAKER_03]: We placed up on the Medford Historical Commission website under the news section, the MHC Form B and our letter that describes why the building was found to be significant.

37
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:52,420
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the second part of the demolition delay process where we determine whether or not the building is preferably preserved.

38
00:02:53,381 --> 00:03:00,209
[SPEAKER_03]: So we ask that the public provide comments to the commission if you wish to speak.

39
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:01,751
[SPEAKER_03]: There will be a

40
00:03:03,693 --> 00:03:22,688
[SPEAKER_03]: about a five minute time allocated to persons wishing to speak for or against the project when I open up the public comment period and if you could before speaking just raise your hand and we'll call on you and if you could before you speak just your name and address for the record okay.

41
00:03:23,428 --> 00:03:26,769
[SPEAKER_03]: But we'll start off this process with the commissioner's comments.

42
00:03:27,009 --> 00:03:50,618
[SPEAKER_03]: And tonight we're determining preferably preserved status, which according to the bylaws, chapter 48, section 77, preferably preserved significant building means any significant building as to which the commission determines as provided in subsections 48-78G, that it is in the public interest to be preserved and rehabilitated rather than demolished.

43
00:03:50,898 --> 00:04:06,777
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are looking tonight to hear comments on the integrity of the building, everything short of the condition of the building, meaning the actual physical structural condition that is a purview of the building department.

44
00:04:06,857 --> 00:04:10,322
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't hear that portion of the

45
00:04:11,342 --> 00:04:36,475
[SPEAKER_03]: structure it's in his purview to order buildings down if structural issues are a cause or we're hearing about the historic persons or people or activities at this particular building or what we are most interested in or general comments from the neighbors and the community as to whether or not the building should be found preferably preserved and preserved and rehabilitated rather than demolished and

46
00:04:36,635 --> 00:04:38,896
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a case of partial demolition.

47
00:04:39,056 --> 00:04:44,477
[SPEAKER_03]: So this property, as we mentioned in last month, should have been flagged by the building department.

48
00:04:44,897 --> 00:04:46,577
[SPEAKER_03]: But unfortunately, it fell by the radar.

49
00:04:46,997 --> 00:04:50,618
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're reviewing this case following the demolition that took place.

50
00:04:51,559 --> 00:04:56,280
[SPEAKER_03]: But the commissioners in cases like this, as in all cases, we determine

51
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:03,726
[SPEAKER_03]: the status based on how the building lies, but also what the building was prior to the demolition that took place.

52
00:05:04,727 --> 00:05:10,994
[SPEAKER_03]: So you guys can see on the MHC inventory form, if you look that up on our website, what the building's condition was.

53
00:05:11,134 --> 00:05:13,877
[SPEAKER_03]: We also have a picture posted on our website.

54
00:05:15,618 --> 00:05:33,275
[SPEAKER_03]: commissioners does anybody want to start off with a motion and that will kick start discussion and then we will go from there and then after the public comment period we'll finish up with the vote and and take steps accordingly.

55
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:39,060
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll make a motion to find

56
00:05:42,888 --> 00:05:45,289
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, this building, uh, preferably preserved.

57
00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:47,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I forgot the address.

58
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:50,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, 110 Brooks Street perfectly preserved.

59
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:52,271
Okay.

60
00:05:53,472 --> 00:05:55,032
[SPEAKER_03]: In a 2nd, I'll 2nd.

61
00:06:00,394 --> 00:06:00,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, thank you.

62
00:06:01,495 --> 00:06:07,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Peter, do you want to start with a discussion and we'll I'll come to a Lenny and then the rest of us will.

63
00:06:09,278 --> 00:06:09,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Comment to her.

64
00:06:12,322 --> 00:06:35,174
[SPEAKER_05]: As in the finding of significance, although the house has been denuded of its siding and windows, I feel like there is still extant detail, the front porch in particular, the

65
00:06:38,002 --> 00:06:40,645
[SPEAKER_05]: attic window has some nice detail.

66
00:06:41,545 --> 00:06:53,757
[SPEAKER_05]: And I feel like the overall mass and, uh, uh, of the building is still intact and could be brought back.

67
00:06:53,837 --> 00:07:01,844
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that previously the original siding had been covered with, uh, vinyl and probably windows replaced anyway.

68
00:07:01,945 --> 00:07:02,245
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um,

69
00:07:04,514 --> 00:07:14,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Although it looks like it's been stripped, which it has from the outside, I still feel like the building has a majority of its integrity intact.

70
00:07:15,543 --> 00:07:30,194
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't believe further demolition is happening, or at least from the drawings I saw that proposed, I knew they were going to tear off the rear L.

71
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,281
[SPEAKER_05]: which I think was a later edition anyway.

72
00:07:37,241 --> 00:07:41,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so I feel like this house is a good candidate.

73
00:07:42,422 --> 00:07:48,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Similar homes to this in the neighborhood, we did find preferably preserved.

74
00:07:50,884 --> 00:07:52,384
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where I'm coming down on this for now.

75
00:07:52,684 --> 00:07:52,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

76
00:07:54,204 --> 00:07:54,404
Great.

77
00:07:55,204 --> 00:07:55,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Lenny?

78
00:07:57,045 --> 00:07:58,025
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I agree with Peter.

79
00:07:59,192 --> 00:08:13,679
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the details that sort of are worth preserving for this building is the attic window and then the columns on the front, sort of like a pattern with the two columns in the front and the back, I think is something worth keeping.

80
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:20,163
[SPEAKER_14]: And I do also agree with the removal of that rear addition.

81
00:08:20,183 --> 00:08:26,886
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that adds to the quality of the building and the design and sort of restoring it back to what it used to look like.

82
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:38,362
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I mean, I think, I mean, I pretty much agree with Peter and, you know, I'm ready to pass it along to Ed.

83
00:08:39,363 --> 00:08:39,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

84
00:08:40,063 --> 00:08:40,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

85
00:08:40,944 --> 00:08:41,924
[SPEAKER_03]: Ed, comments?

86
00:08:44,406 --> 00:08:55,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, given the history of the work on the building, given what we've seen of the history in terms of what was removed,

87
00:08:57,173 --> 00:09:06,742
[SPEAKER_04]: And the intent of basically, this is really a restoration rather than a demolition, I think, yes, it should be preserved, but I think it hopefully will be a short proceeding.

88
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:14,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, thank you.

89
00:09:16,372 --> 00:09:17,193
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we're gonna

90
00:09:18,707 --> 00:09:20,108
[SPEAKER_03]: open it up to public comments.

91
00:09:21,669 --> 00:09:33,135
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to ask the homeowners if they'd like to make any sort of statement to start with that, and then we'll go with those against the project, those for the project.

92
00:09:34,015 --> 00:09:38,818
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you would just raise your hand, I'll recognize you as we go along.

93
00:09:39,158 --> 00:09:43,500
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I don't see anybody else, then we'll close the public comments and go from there.

94
00:09:45,561 --> 00:09:46,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Homeowners, Adriana?

95
00:09:48,062 --> 00:09:57,685
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, so I'm Andreana and I am one of the homeowners along with my husband Chris and our daughter Lucia.

96
00:09:59,146 --> 00:10:06,348
[SPEAKER_11]: We hope that we can work with the historic commission in a forward motion to restore this house to

97
00:10:07,809 --> 00:10:12,073
[SPEAKER_11]: a beautiful home and true to its historic value.

98
00:10:12,093 --> 00:10:21,203
[SPEAKER_11]: The design as we proposed is pretty much in keeping with the original design we feel.

99
00:10:21,223 --> 00:10:25,528
[SPEAKER_11]: Upon removing those windows when we were

100
00:10:26,028 --> 00:10:45,898
[SPEAKER_11]: demoing that home, we actually found that the original window sizes were much larger, and I have selected windows accordingly to ensure that we're in keeping with the original scale of the windows and whatnot, but we're also open to keeping similar columns and such.

101
00:10:47,419 --> 00:10:56,028
[SPEAKER_11]: We're just hoping that we can move forward as quickly as possible to, uh, you know, avoid any other financial, uh, burdens with this project.

102
00:10:56,128 --> 00:11:00,193
[SPEAKER_11]: So we look forward to, um, moving on from here.

103
00:11:03,116 --> 00:11:03,316
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

104
00:11:03,717 --> 00:11:03,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

105
00:11:05,058 --> 00:11:09,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, Chris, anything to add while you're can't hear you.

106
00:11:18,117 --> 00:11:19,499
[SPEAKER_11]: He's with my daughter upstairs.

107
00:11:19,539 --> 00:11:20,901
[SPEAKER_11]: I apologize.

108
00:11:20,961 --> 00:11:26,930
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to make sure that he, if he had something to add, I'd be happy to hear him out, but that's okay.

109
00:11:27,631 --> 00:11:29,053
[SPEAKER_11]: Chris, do you have anything to add?

110
00:11:31,192 --> 00:11:32,713
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, the only thing I was actually going to.

111
00:11:33,514 --> 00:11:34,294
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, apologies.

112
00:11:34,314 --> 00:11:41,398
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trying to do ear buds and clearly technology is not working with me and I'm sitting here with my 5 year old daughter, which.

113
00:11:42,259 --> 00:11:51,204
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I was so happy for this meeting just to have something easier to do this evening than trying to get a 5 year old to not hop in front of the screen while I'm on it.

114
00:11:52,385 --> 00:11:54,907
[SPEAKER_00]: But I, I do appreciate the fact that.

115
00:11:56,288 --> 00:11:59,429
[SPEAKER_00]: That the historic society has been moving so quickly throughout.

116
00:12:00,728 --> 00:12:04,194
[SPEAKER_00]: This process everyone has been extremely accommodating to us in the previous meeting.

117
00:12:04,214 --> 00:12:10,405
[SPEAKER_00]: And as my wife had said, we are keeping, we are keeping the overall integrity of the building as it is there.

118
00:12:11,807 --> 00:12:12,107
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe.

119
00:12:13,779 --> 00:12:17,940
[SPEAKER_00]: Ryan, you said that at the beginning of the meeting, that it didn't look like there was any new demo that was planned.

120
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,440
[SPEAKER_00]: That is 100% accurate.

121
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,481
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not tearing down the building.

122
00:12:21,501 --> 00:12:23,621
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had no intention of tearing down the building.

123
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:35,084
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the reasons that we actually were looking towards moving into this neighborhood, aside from the fact that we thought it would be a great place to raise our family, was how grand this building looked.

124
00:12:35,764 --> 00:12:40,765
[SPEAKER_00]: And our overall intent is to be able to restore this house to the best of our ability.

125
00:12:42,245 --> 00:12:47,028
[SPEAKER_00]: And just if we're able to do it, you know, clearly, well, we have the funding to be able to do it.

126
00:12:47,088 --> 00:12:52,291
[SPEAKER_00]: So as quickly as we can go through this process, and we're looking forward to working with you throughout it.

127
00:12:54,532 --> 00:12:54,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

128
00:12:57,674 --> 00:13:07,720
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, public comments from anybody else at the meeting, if you just want to raise your hand, I'm happy to acknowledge you, Susan, let's start with you.

129
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:10,181
[SPEAKER_03]: I just need your name and address for the record.

130
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:14,340
[SPEAKER_03]: And you've got to unmute yourself.

131
00:13:17,141 --> 00:13:21,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.

132
00:13:21,824 --> 00:13:22,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Teresa.

133
00:13:23,665 --> 00:13:24,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I sent them a message.

134
00:13:24,926 --> 00:13:25,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Susan.

135
00:13:25,627 --> 00:13:28,188
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, can you make me co-host because I can just.

136
00:13:32,285 --> 00:13:32,725
[SPEAKER_09]: Are we on?

137
00:13:33,186 --> 00:13:34,346
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, you are.

138
00:13:34,366 --> 00:13:34,586
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

139
00:13:35,667 --> 00:13:37,909
[SPEAKER_09]: You need to say who you are.

140
00:13:37,929 --> 00:13:41,791
[SPEAKER_09]: I am Yehudi Weiner at 49 Brook Street.

141
00:13:41,951 --> 00:13:44,673
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Susan Weiner, my beloved wife.

142
00:13:46,234 --> 00:13:56,801
[SPEAKER_09]: And we are not so close to that threat of demolition or of the renovation of the property, but we walk and we are very much part of the neighborhood.

143
00:13:57,381 --> 00:13:58,582
[SPEAKER_09]: The building, in my opinion,

144
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:03,563
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm not an architect, I'm a composer of music, but I've lived with architects.

145
00:14:04,124 --> 00:14:19,435
[SPEAKER_09]: And I must say what my closest friend of the last 10-15 years was Harry Cobb of New York, whom all of you know well, I'm sure, in the architectural realm.

146
00:14:20,216 --> 00:14:22,858
[SPEAKER_09]: The building has such beautiful stature.

147
00:14:23,499 --> 00:14:28,843
[SPEAKER_09]: It sits so handsomely right there on the street.

148
00:14:29,104 --> 00:14:33,027
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the last of the large buildings on that side of the street.

149
00:14:34,008 --> 00:14:45,297
[SPEAKER_09]: There are other very attractive domiciles, but that building has a kind of monumental presence, which at the same time, while it's monumental, is not pretentious.

150
00:14:46,238 --> 00:14:56,708
[SPEAKER_09]: And having cleared the property, we see that there's enormous potential for building there, for grooming the house.

151
00:14:57,368 --> 00:14:59,611
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course, we don't know the interior of the house.

152
00:14:59,671 --> 00:15:08,178
[SPEAKER_09]: But I assume with a conscientious, and I would say creative architect, that wonderful things will take place.

153
00:15:11,081 --> 00:15:11,281
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

154
00:15:11,642 --> 00:15:12,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else?

155
00:15:16,175 --> 00:15:17,196
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate your comments.

156
00:15:17,256 --> 00:15:17,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

157
00:15:21,099 --> 00:15:21,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Wendy.

158
00:15:25,062 --> 00:15:27,544
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, thank you, Reverend Wendy Miller Olapade.

159
00:15:27,624 --> 00:15:31,206
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm the resident of the property right across the street from 110.

160
00:15:32,748 --> 00:15:37,611
[SPEAKER_08]: I live at 105 Brooks, which is owned by the Congregational Church of West Medford.

161
00:15:37,631 --> 00:15:44,877
[SPEAKER_08]: I happen to have the benefit of living in this beautiful neighborhood because of my position as the pastor of that church.

162
00:15:45,983 --> 00:15:51,045
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just want to affirm my appreciation for the work that's already been done.

163
00:15:51,105 --> 00:15:53,665
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry for my weird camera position here.

164
00:15:53,705 --> 00:15:54,405
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm on the move.

165
00:15:55,406 --> 00:16:01,447
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to celebrate, you know, the care and commitment that the commission is putting into this.

166
00:16:01,948 --> 00:16:06,669
[SPEAKER_08]: But I do want to encourage you to move promptly because I am tired of looking.

167
00:16:08,357 --> 00:16:10,658
[SPEAKER_08]: looking at that poor house all torn apart.

168
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:20,543
[SPEAKER_08]: It is a beautiful neighborhood and I have no objections at all to moving forward with the plan that our new neighbors have proposed.

169
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:22,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

170
00:16:23,204 --> 00:16:23,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

171
00:16:28,026 --> 00:16:28,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Heather and John?

172
00:16:32,768 --> 00:16:33,628
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to unmute yourself?

173
00:16:33,648 --> 00:16:34,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on, I'll do it.

174
00:16:34,849 --> 00:16:36,950
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

175
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:38,170
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

176
00:16:39,371 --> 00:16:41,652
[SPEAKER_01]: I certainly echo Wendy's comments.

177
00:16:42,812 --> 00:16:59,639
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would just add that this has actually been an ordeal that's been going on for several years as we watched the house sort of become more overgrown, look more and more desolate, lots of negative stuff going on.

178
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:05,782
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually removing all the aluminum siding and so forth,

179
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:18,974
[SPEAKER_01]: actually improved the look of the house, but we're getting a little tired of looking at the sheeting, and I would just urge the commission, do everything you can.

180
00:17:18,994 --> 00:17:27,236
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on, John.

181
00:17:27,256 --> 00:17:27,936
[SPEAKER_03]: You got muted.

182
00:17:27,996 --> 00:17:28,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything you can.

183
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:45,765
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just, as I was saying, I would just urge you to do everything you can to get this project moving forward as quickly as possible.

184
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:49,447
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I speak for all the neighbors when I say that.

185
00:17:49,588 --> 00:17:52,750
[SPEAKER_01]: And Heather, my wife, would like to say something.

186
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:56,272
[SPEAKER_10]: You've never known me not to rhyme, right?

187
00:17:56,352 --> 00:17:57,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a quick point.

188
00:17:57,653 --> 00:17:58,494
[SPEAKER_03]: What is your address?

189
00:17:58,534 --> 00:18:00,115
[SPEAKER_10]: Just so that I know.

190
00:18:00,135 --> 00:18:00,875
[SPEAKER_10]: 102 Brooks.

191
00:18:00,895 --> 00:18:01,255
[SPEAKER_10]: 102 Brooks.

192
00:18:01,716 --> 00:18:01,836
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

193
00:18:01,856 --> 00:18:01,936
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

194
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:26,821
[SPEAKER_10]: I would just like to comment that this is a house that's been in trouble for over 40 years, that this young couple has come into the neighborhood and made every effort to connect with the neighbors, including joining our current rat project, which is not exactly the kind of thing that I'm sure they have time for at this point.

195
00:18:27,401 --> 00:18:38,485
[SPEAKER_10]: So they have reached out not only in terms of what they need to do, but they have reached out to assist and become part of the neighborhood in terms of other projects that we have going on as neighbors.

196
00:18:39,145 --> 00:18:50,090
[SPEAKER_10]: So again, we've seen the pictures, we've seen the 40 years of history, all of the neighbors that are up here tonight, we have all been in communication with each other, and we support

197
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:54,292
[SPEAKER_10]: the Kardashians and the plans that they have.

198
00:18:54,372 --> 00:18:57,473
[SPEAKER_10]: And we'd like to see them in by Christmas, but that's getting to be a little tricky.

199
00:19:00,775 --> 00:19:01,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

200
00:19:04,117 --> 00:19:04,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Monique.

201
00:19:06,258 --> 00:19:07,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Name and address for the record.

202
00:19:15,824 --> 00:19:18,045
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll try again, Monique Doherty.

203
00:19:22,615 --> 00:19:23,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there you are.

204
00:19:23,577 --> 00:19:23,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

205
00:19:24,479 --> 00:19:25,601
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, one sec.

206
00:19:27,925 --> 00:19:29,347
[SPEAKER_03]: We can hear you and you're speaking.

207
00:19:31,248 --> 00:19:35,549
[SPEAKER_13]: So Adriana and Christopher, Chris, welcome to the neighborhood.

208
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:40,830
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm so glad to see something being done with that beautiful architecture.

209
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:45,430
[SPEAKER_13]: I have seen the inside and there are so many gems in that building.

210
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:54,492
[SPEAKER_13]: And I appreciate all the efforts you're making to make sure that we have an understanding of what your plans are.

211
00:19:54,512 --> 00:19:57,033
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you.

212
00:19:57,293 --> 00:19:59,533
[SPEAKER_13]: I hope we can get this moving for you.

213
00:20:00,744 --> 00:20:01,825
[SPEAKER_13]: and get you into the house.

214
00:20:01,845 --> 00:20:04,126
[SPEAKER_13]: So welcome to the neighborhood.

215
00:20:04,146 --> 00:20:10,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Monica, what is your address just so I can... We are across the street, diagonally across the street.

216
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,831
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry about that.

217
00:20:11,851 --> 00:20:12,392
[SPEAKER_13]: 113 Brook Street.

218
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:13,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

219
00:20:18,295 --> 00:20:18,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.

220
00:20:19,296 --> 00:20:19,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else?

221
00:20:21,437 --> 00:20:22,378
[SPEAKER_13]: No, thank you.

222
00:20:22,398 --> 00:20:23,259
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

223
00:20:23,439 --> 00:20:23,979
[SPEAKER_13]: You're welcome.

224
00:20:26,641 --> 00:20:27,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other public comments?

225
00:20:30,202 --> 00:20:31,563
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I would like to say something.

226
00:20:31,843 --> 00:20:34,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, Judith, name and address for the record.

227
00:20:34,584 --> 00:20:36,725
[SPEAKER_07]: It's 124 Brook Street.

228
00:20:43,147 --> 00:20:45,268
[SPEAKER_07]: And Judith Watkinson, as you can see.

229
00:20:47,002 --> 00:20:53,805
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just want to give our support as well for the family.

230
00:20:54,605 --> 00:20:56,226
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, Kadachi is it?

231
00:20:56,366 --> 00:20:58,027
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry if I'm not saying it properly.

232
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:06,450
[SPEAKER_07]: We have been living in the street and the house has been, quite honestly, an eyesore for so long.

233
00:21:07,331 --> 00:21:08,711
[SPEAKER_07]: I just feel very, very

234
00:21:10,703 --> 00:21:17,687
[SPEAKER_07]: sad that things are being held up when somebody is obviously wanting to do a great job and restore it to something really beautiful.

235
00:21:18,188 --> 00:21:20,689
[SPEAKER_07]: So we just want to express our support for them.

236
00:21:20,829 --> 00:21:25,212
[SPEAKER_07]: And hopefully, we can move forward as quickly as possible on their behalf.

237
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:26,152
Great.

238
00:21:29,915 --> 00:21:30,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

239
00:21:30,635 --> 00:21:31,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else?

240
00:21:31,716 --> 00:21:32,076
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

241
00:21:32,116 --> 00:21:32,476
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

242
00:21:32,816 --> 00:21:33,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

243
00:21:33,157 --> 00:21:33,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

244
00:21:34,437 --> 00:21:35,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other public comments?

245
00:21:39,415 --> 00:21:39,815
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

246
00:21:39,876 --> 00:21:46,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeing none, I'll close public comments and we'll go to the commissioners for final thoughts.

247
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:50,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Any further thoughts on the matter?

248
00:21:50,787 --> 00:21:52,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Any further discussion on the building?

249
00:21:52,188 --> 00:21:54,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, I'll do a roll call vote.

250
00:21:54,511 --> 00:22:00,697
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion was made by Peter Miller to find the building significant, seconded by Eleni.

251
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:07,191
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, hearing no opposition, I'll do a roll call vote.

252
00:22:07,531 --> 00:22:27,034
[SPEAKER_03]: A yes vote for that motion will invoke the up to 18 month demo delay, during which time we would send the plans to the subcommittee who would review them and ask for any architectural changes, and then they would come back for approval for the commission.

253
00:22:27,414 --> 00:22:31,435
[SPEAKER_03]: A no vote would allow them to move forward with the project as it stands, as it exists

254
00:22:31,895 --> 00:22:35,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Now with the building permit, is that understood by all the commissioners?

255
00:22:36,657 --> 00:22:38,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

256
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:42,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Roll call vote, starting with Peter.

257
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:43,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

258
00:22:45,441 --> 00:22:45,941
[SPEAKER_03]: And Eleni.

259
00:22:47,142 --> 00:22:47,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

260
00:22:48,042 --> 00:22:48,382
[SPEAKER_03]: And Ed.

261
00:22:49,483 --> 00:22:51,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, with the hope this will not be an 18-month case.

262
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:52,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

263
00:22:53,044 --> 00:22:54,445
[SPEAKER_03]: So motion passes three to zero.

264
00:22:56,353 --> 00:23:05,992
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we will do is we will file our letter and then we will immediately send the project to the subcommittee that's Doug and Peter and.

265
00:23:10,763 --> 00:23:12,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you frozen?

266
00:23:12,463 --> 00:23:17,765
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll grab one of the commissioners and then we will review the project.

267
00:23:18,425 --> 00:23:23,566
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's any architectural changes, we'll set up a time via Zoom to meet with you guys.

268
00:23:24,067 --> 00:23:31,589
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we have a meeting planned for the second week of November, I believe.

269
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:36,370
[SPEAKER_03]: So our hope is that we would get you back

270
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:43,232
[SPEAKER_03]: But if the architectural plans can be changed quickly enough, we may even be able to do it at the end of this month.

271
00:23:44,192 --> 00:23:59,157
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think we need it, but there may be an opportunity to just finish up and release the project at the end of the month if all those very minimal architectural changes that I think the commission will ask for can be taken care of.

272
00:23:59,297 --> 00:23:59,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that make sense?

273
00:24:02,938 --> 00:24:03,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

274
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:09,642
[SPEAKER_03]: So we will summarize that in our letter, and I'll send out something.

275
00:24:09,682 --> 00:24:14,744
[SPEAKER_03]: I just have to make sure I work with Jen tomorrow morning to get that filed with the clerk's office.

276
00:24:14,904 --> 00:24:23,086
[SPEAKER_03]: And then from there, I'll confer with the three commissioner subcommittee, and then we'll set up a Zoom meeting with the homeowners.

277
00:24:24,447 --> 00:24:24,767
[SPEAKER_03]: OK?

278
00:24:25,407 --> 00:24:25,867
[SPEAKER_11]: Wonderful.

279
00:24:26,007 --> 00:24:26,668
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much.

280
00:24:26,928 --> 00:24:27,188
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks.

281
00:24:32,009 --> 00:24:33,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Jennifer Keenan, are you?

282
00:24:34,655 --> 00:24:36,416
[SPEAKER_03]: On this meeting still, if not, I'll text it.

283
00:24:43,978 --> 00:24:45,399
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to wait for Jen to come back.

284
00:24:45,879 --> 00:24:57,402
[SPEAKER_03]: In the meantime, we can start our discussion of the next agenda item, which is the determination of significance for the CPC project for City Hall.

285
00:24:58,143 --> 00:24:59,043
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's Teresa.

286
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:01,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

287
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:10,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so I sent out earlier, uh, to all the commissioners, the MHC inventory form for city hall.

288
00:25:10,587 --> 00:25:15,531
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe Teresa wants to talk to us about what those projects are that are being planned for the building.

289
00:25:15,551 --> 00:25:19,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I think that those will have an impact on the project.

290
00:25:19,974 --> 00:25:20,334
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

291
00:25:22,336 --> 00:25:23,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, good evening, everybody.

292
00:25:23,837 --> 00:25:27,640
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the community preservation act manager for the city of Medford.

293
00:25:28,562 --> 00:25:35,628
[SPEAKER_02]: We have an application before us from the facilities department at City Hall to do some upgrades to the bathroom.

294
00:25:36,309 --> 00:25:44,755
[SPEAKER_02]: They're using the criteria of historic preservation as the building we feel is historically significant.

295
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:51,641
[SPEAKER_02]: So tonight, as part of the funding, we would require a determination of significance, a favorable

296
00:25:52,459 --> 00:25:58,605
[SPEAKER_02]: A determinant of significance from the local historical commission to be used in our consideration of the application.

297
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:07,232
[SPEAKER_02]: So, tonight, I'm here to ask this body to please consider city hall to be a building of significance.

298
00:26:07,873 --> 00:26:09,194
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm happy to answer any questions.

299
00:26:09,214 --> 00:26:10,355
[SPEAKER_02]: I will stop talking.

300
00:26:14,107 --> 00:26:14,727
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have a question.

301
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:31,873
[SPEAKER_03]: So is the plan to, it's probably a combination of ADA, MAS 521 CMR upgrades, which is all handicap accessibility, but also some reconfiguration of the bathrooms to probably optimize them.

302
00:26:31,953 --> 00:26:38,636
[SPEAKER_03]: But the plan is to kind of preserve and maintain all the ornate finishes within as best as possible.

303
00:26:38,656 --> 00:26:40,956
[SPEAKER_02]: As much as possible.

304
00:26:41,177 --> 00:26:42,257
[SPEAKER_02]: There have been some

305
00:26:44,215 --> 00:26:56,305
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't say poor renovations done, but haphazard perhaps might be the better term from what they originally were to where they are now for us to at least have an handicapped accessible stall.

306
00:26:56,725 --> 00:27:00,508
[SPEAKER_02]: However, it does not meet requirements from the ADA.

307
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:10,796
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the first phase of what we hope to see as a multiple phase project where we would first make those ADA improvements to the public facilities.

308
00:27:13,459 --> 00:27:20,135
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in a perhaps a later year, they would that's whenever reconfiguration each back.

309
00:27:21,452 --> 00:27:23,013
[SPEAKER_02]: those type of upgrades would be made.

310
00:27:23,033 --> 00:27:24,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Ryan, looks like you have a question.

311
00:27:24,673 --> 00:27:25,013
[SPEAKER_03]: I do.

312
00:27:25,153 --> 00:27:25,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

313
00:27:25,414 --> 00:27:40,580
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's going to roll into the right next logical question, which is what has the city done for an assessment on the entire building, including a space needs assessment for all the departments and various upgrades, you know, the exterior envelope?

314
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:46,302
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we went through a series of restorations, but if there's a complete plan somewhere that the city is referencing,

315
00:27:46,522 --> 00:27:49,763
[SPEAKER_03]: great, but if there's not, perhaps now would be an optimal time.

316
00:27:49,803 --> 00:28:11,871
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, I can see maintaining the historic integrity of some of the bathrooms, maybe perhaps on the most public floors, but then there's an opportunity to certainly renovate other spaces in the building to consolidate those poor, quote unquote, poor renovations into something that's a little bit more spectacular for the inhabitants of City Hall, right?

317
00:28:11,891 --> 00:28:15,473
[SPEAKER_03]: So the buildings are, is well used and we wanna make sure that it's,

318
00:28:16,193 --> 00:28:37,948
[SPEAKER_03]: up to par so i'm just curious if there's an assessment on those spaces or even just like for example an assessment on all the public spaces you know and all the needs for accessibility etc i know you guys are doing something with the elevator as well so i'm sure there's something but yes um to the best of my knowledge which i'm i'm

319
00:28:39,066 --> 00:28:42,970
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried to be involved with everything, but I don't know everything.

320
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:51,400
[SPEAKER_02]: To the best of my knowledge, I don't believe a conditions assessment or a feasibility study or just an assessment in general of City Hall has happened.

321
00:28:52,501 --> 00:28:57,867
[SPEAKER_02]: About 18 months ago, I think it was, is when we hired the first facilities director for the city.

322
00:29:00,086 --> 00:29:03,528
[SPEAKER_02]: So that could be a project that could be happening that I'm just not aware of.

323
00:29:04,068 --> 00:29:11,491
[SPEAKER_02]: However, as the Facilities Director is the one applying for this funding to upgrade the bathrooms, I'm sure he would have mentioned that.

324
00:29:12,231 --> 00:29:16,713
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't want to say no, but I believe the answer is no, an assessment has not been done.

325
00:29:16,773 --> 00:29:21,015
[SPEAKER_02]: We have looked at individual properties across the city.

326
00:29:22,356 --> 00:29:28,778
[SPEAKER_02]: A conversation about the Curtis Tufts School comes to mind, trying to look at an assessment for that building.

327
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:34,654
[SPEAKER_02]: But yes, unfortunately, to the best of my knowledge, I believe the answer is no.

328
00:29:35,956 --> 00:29:37,739
[SPEAKER_02]: That has not happened yet.

329
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,323
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be something the CTA could consider.

330
00:29:43,539 --> 00:29:54,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think our, for me, for me, the, my, and I'm sure maybe Peter might chime in and Doug, if he were here, and he eventually will chime in through the CPC.

331
00:29:55,244 --> 00:30:00,727
[SPEAKER_03]: I think 1 of the things that we will ask for as part of this is funding.

332
00:30:00,767 --> 00:30:03,028
[SPEAKER_03]: The work is taking a step.

333
00:30:03,808 --> 00:30:06,531
[SPEAKER_03]: backwards and at least assessing the entire building.

334
00:30:07,672 --> 00:30:14,620
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there's been various things been done to assess the envelope and assess the roof structure because there's the

335
00:30:18,487 --> 00:30:20,248
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanna say satellites, it's not satellites.

336
00:30:20,268 --> 00:30:21,949
[SPEAKER_03]: The solar panels are on top of the roof.

337
00:30:22,009 --> 00:30:40,521
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I know various things have been done, but I think a comprehend, you know, just like every other building that we look at, like the cemetery complex or the fire stations, I think this building really deserves a complex view headed by an architectural team that's gonna not just look at the bathrooms, but gonna give the city an assessment of all the projects that need to be done.

338
00:30:42,002 --> 00:30:45,625
[SPEAKER_03]: Good time for all the departments to chime in and figure out what they need for space and,

339
00:30:46,325 --> 00:30:56,370
[SPEAKER_03]: if there's any reconfiguration, and then give a dollar amount to not just the CPC, but the entire city, knowing what the taxpayers are going to pay, and then prioritize, right?

340
00:30:56,410 --> 00:31:01,012
[SPEAKER_03]: So if the bathrooms are the most important thing that needs to be done right here and now, then great.

341
00:31:01,453 --> 00:31:05,555
[SPEAKER_03]: But at least they have the plan then to back it up and know what also is coming.

342
00:31:05,575 --> 00:31:09,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, almost like a master plan.

343
00:31:09,397 --> 00:31:09,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

344
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:10,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

345
00:31:11,678 --> 00:31:13,679
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say that's an incredibly fair point.

346
00:31:14,951 --> 00:31:17,073
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of upset that perhaps I didn't think of that first.

347
00:31:17,253 --> 00:31:18,634
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you, Ryan.

348
00:31:18,674 --> 00:31:20,956
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's something I can absolutely bring back.

349
00:31:21,016 --> 00:31:38,031
[SPEAKER_02]: And we could even make that a condition of our funding is that prior to or within a certain amount of time frame from this funding, you must conduct an assessment of at least City Hall with the intention of all buildings.

350
00:31:39,833 --> 00:31:41,294
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes down to a matter of funding.

351
00:31:43,752 --> 00:31:50,278
[SPEAKER_02]: As to why that hasn't happened yet and, as you mentioned, we can outsource this to consultants who can do the work.

352
00:31:50,298 --> 00:31:50,879
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not.

353
00:31:51,579 --> 00:31:56,063
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's super taxing on the little limited staff that we have.

354
00:31:56,764 --> 00:31:58,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you make that a condition of this?

355
00:31:59,639 --> 00:32:01,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Determination of significance?

356
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a determination of significance.

357
00:32:03,501 --> 00:32:15,408
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the significance is the significance, but it's going to be our recommendation as part of the official role of reviewing CPC projects is going to request that the CPC make that a condition of funding.

358
00:32:16,688 --> 00:32:19,770
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to clarify what I said about master plan.

359
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:22,371
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't mean for the entire city.

360
00:32:22,612 --> 00:32:24,853
[SPEAKER_05]: I meant more just for this building.

361
00:32:25,802 --> 00:32:27,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, we can take it on a building by building basis.

362
00:32:29,224 --> 00:32:31,325
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the city's well on its way, right?

363
00:32:31,365 --> 00:32:37,327
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm sure the schools have something because they're newer buildings and the fire department has something.

364
00:32:37,447 --> 00:32:38,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Police department's a new building.

365
00:32:38,948 --> 00:32:41,249
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's being done in bits and bobs.

366
00:32:41,269 --> 00:32:42,390
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a matter of somebody.

367
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:47,412
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think this is a standalone project just all in itself.

368
00:32:47,992 --> 00:32:49,113
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's deserving.

369
00:32:49,453 --> 00:32:56,499
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I can roll into the history of the building, but it definitely is, in my opinion, deserving of funding.

370
00:32:59,242 --> 00:33:01,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Did everybody have a chance to review the form?

371
00:33:03,165 --> 00:33:04,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Does anybody want to kickstart comments?

372
00:33:06,248 --> 00:33:08,190
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll make a motion to fine for significance.

373
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:09,351
[SPEAKER_12]: Great, Jen.

374
00:33:13,294 --> 00:33:13,794
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll second.

375
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Lenny got a second.

376
00:33:20,514 --> 00:33:20,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, Ed.

377
00:33:21,636 --> 00:33:23,198
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Jen, if you want to start.

378
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:25,902
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure, um.

379
00:33:27,284 --> 00:33:29,787
[SPEAKER_12]: I think this is a pretty slam dunk case of significance.

380
00:33:32,123 --> 00:33:34,404
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, no, I was thinking that we had already determined significance.

381
00:33:34,424 --> 00:33:36,304
[SPEAKER_12]: We just didn't write a letter, but that was something else.

382
00:33:37,964 --> 00:33:42,766
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, obviously, it's, you know, kind of our shining beacon in the city.

383
00:33:42,786 --> 00:33:44,426
[SPEAKER_12]: It has the beautiful rotunda.

384
00:33:44,966 --> 00:33:49,307
[SPEAKER_12]: It's been recommended for a National Register listing.

385
00:33:49,727 --> 00:33:52,168
[SPEAKER_12]: So to me, it's kind of a no-brainer.

386
00:33:52,188 --> 00:33:56,829
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't really feel like it warrants massive amounts of discussion.

387
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:00,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

388
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:01,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Hannah Lenny?

389
00:34:02,936 --> 00:34:04,638
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I think this is an easy one.

390
00:34:04,658 --> 00:34:09,505
[SPEAKER_14]: It is obviously significant historically and architecturally.

391
00:34:09,586 --> 00:34:11,829
[SPEAKER_14]: And yeah, I don't really have much to add.

392
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:14,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

393
00:34:14,813 --> 00:34:16,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Peter, anything to add?

394
00:34:16,536 --> 00:34:16,736
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

395
00:34:17,537 --> 00:34:17,838
[SPEAKER_03]: And Ed?

396
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:21,534
[SPEAKER_04]: classic piece of WPA Medford significance.

397
00:34:21,554 --> 00:34:30,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's like one of the three beacons, this and former DPW building, Chevalier, Post Office, all the projects here in Medford.

398
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:34,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I just want to note for anybody watching at home,

399
00:34:35,022 --> 00:34:36,484
[SPEAKER_03]: more watching this project.

400
00:34:36,504 --> 00:34:38,625
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a building built by Michael A. Dyer.

401
00:34:39,506 --> 00:34:43,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Michael Dyer is one of the most prolific architect builders in the city of Medford.

402
00:34:43,309 --> 00:34:48,833
[SPEAKER_03]: He, in fact, at one point probably had done most of the municipal projects in the 1930s.

403
00:34:49,194 --> 00:34:56,139
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe he or his father served as a one-time city mayor, so it's very important.

404
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:00,663
[SPEAKER_03]: He did take this design elsewhere.

405
00:35:01,303 --> 00:35:10,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Woburn City Hall looks almost identical to this building, but our building was first, so we'd like to think that he designed our building first and took the design elsewhere.

406
00:35:11,831 --> 00:35:15,234
[SPEAKER_03]: And it really, inside and out, maintains a lot of integrity.

407
00:35:15,274 --> 00:35:20,477
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of cool features to this building, from the hallways to the

408
00:35:21,438 --> 00:35:30,901
[SPEAKER_03]: offices and certainly the auditorium space and even the clock tower is kind of nice.

409
00:35:31,441 --> 00:35:35,822
[SPEAKER_03]: And it sits upon what is later known as Medford Town Common.

410
00:35:35,862 --> 00:35:37,723
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the municipal center for Medford.

411
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:42,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Unlike an 18th century common, this is more, it started off as a gravel pit and then

412
00:35:43,464 --> 00:35:51,809
[SPEAKER_03]: became a public park and is now home to our city hall after much fanfare, much debate on what to do with it.

413
00:35:51,989 --> 00:35:58,573
[SPEAKER_03]: And the city of Medford, 16 years before building this building, tore down their town hall without a plan.

414
00:35:58,713 --> 00:36:05,197
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd like to see not that happen and not have a plan for this building.

415
00:36:05,397 --> 00:36:09,419
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, so that's just my thoughts.

416
00:36:10,882 --> 00:36:17,066
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, with anybody else, with nobody else here and nobody else having comments, I'll take a roll call vote.

417
00:36:18,387 --> 00:36:21,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion was for significance, so Jen?

418
00:36:22,929 --> 00:36:23,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

419
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:25,951
[SPEAKER_03]: And Eleni?

420
00:36:26,411 --> 00:36:26,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

421
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:28,092
[SPEAKER_03]: And Ed?

422
00:36:29,173 --> 00:36:29,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

423
00:36:30,334 --> 00:36:30,774
[SPEAKER_03]: And Peter?

424
00:36:31,214 --> 00:36:31,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

425
00:36:31,975 --> 00:36:33,716
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, motion passes for nothing.

426
00:36:35,757 --> 00:36:38,379
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll get a letter out to you.

427
00:36:39,619 --> 00:36:40,600
[SPEAKER_12]: Fantastic, thank you.

428
00:36:41,798 --> 00:36:42,818
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Teresa.

429
00:36:45,259 --> 00:37:00,806
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, since we have you, Teresa, and I think you had sent around the email about the quadrennial, I'm butchering that, quadrennial ideas.

430
00:37:00,866 --> 00:37:01,646
[SPEAKER_12]: Quadricennial.

431
00:37:02,406 --> 00:37:02,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

432
00:37:03,006 --> 00:37:04,987
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I think I put it wrong on the agenda.

433
00:37:08,596 --> 00:37:12,097
[SPEAKER_12]: This is our next agenda item, not to steal that from Ryan.

434
00:37:12,217 --> 00:37:13,317
[SPEAKER_03]: No, go ahead.

435
00:37:14,178 --> 00:37:21,820
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that you had sent an email back a while back and then Doug reminded me that we needed to talk about this.

436
00:37:24,881 --> 00:37:30,303
[SPEAKER_12]: This is the city's 100th anniversary.

437
00:37:31,203 --> 00:37:31,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

438
00:37:32,363 --> 00:37:37,965
[SPEAKER_02]: I know some people have been bringing this to us like, well, that's still six years away.

439
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:41,952
[SPEAKER_02]: 6 years ago was way too long.

440
00:37:41,992 --> 00:37:43,492
[SPEAKER_02]: So time will go quickly.

441
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:51,256
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just wanted to get this at least started to be talked about so that it's not a mad dash at the end to start pulling something together.

442
00:37:51,276 --> 00:38:01,202
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I had circulated an ideas list of how this could be celebrated through, or it was just the idea of, hey, we should start planning this.

443
00:38:02,536 --> 00:38:05,398
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know that I've seen an ideas list, but I'd be curious.

444
00:38:06,238 --> 00:38:12,301
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, what the ideas are, are we going to pull a committee together to like a formal committee.

445
00:38:12,321 --> 00:38:16,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Fundraise is going to be money in the city budget.

446
00:38:17,564 --> 00:38:22,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and that's another reason why we're talking about it now is budgeting purposes, but I'm.

447
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:35,629
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that we should hold together a committee and whether that is a representative from the Historical Commission, maybe CPC, maybe from the Treasury.

448
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:47,318
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot what their fiscal task force or something like that, but having the right players as well as community member volunteers to serve the board as well.

449
00:38:48,422 --> 00:38:59,149
[SPEAKER_02]: We would love to have the Anderson's on the things like that, but that was my initial thought was put together a committee of established members as well as new volunteers to really start.

450
00:38:59,549 --> 00:39:04,273
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if we tag team with the historical commission society, but.

451
00:39:05,673 --> 00:39:07,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of ideas, I don't know what what.

452
00:39:09,289 --> 00:39:15,510
[SPEAKER_02]: You may have kicked around, but we should form a committee, I think, with five to seven members.

453
00:39:17,591 --> 00:39:18,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we can bring in Tufts.

454
00:39:19,011 --> 00:39:20,511
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just spitballing at this point.

455
00:39:20,571 --> 00:39:22,932
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't prepared.

456
00:39:23,172 --> 00:39:28,293
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the committee is going to need a budget, which is always a challenge.

457
00:39:30,453 --> 00:39:35,054
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I definitely think a mix of city stakeholders, commission members,

458
00:39:35,726 --> 00:39:42,869
[SPEAKER_12]: residents, anybody that's potentially interested, Chamber of Commerce.

459
00:39:42,889 --> 00:39:57,916
[SPEAKER_12]: I always think of the commission, I always think of like, we're the B2B and the Chamber of Commerce is the consumer facing, like they're in charge of parades and things like that.

460
00:39:58,276 --> 00:40:00,137
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think for an event like this,

461
00:40:01,257 --> 00:40:17,137
[SPEAKER_12]: I think kind of a united front would be fun and you know not we don't typically kind of get involved with those things but I think it would be fun to be involved this time with such a big thing and I don't know maybe

462
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:32,136
[SPEAKER_12]: Ryan, we can use it as a way to like celebrate our oldest buildings or highlight some of our oldest buildings, a walking tour, or I'm sure we could come up with some like events.

463
00:40:32,236 --> 00:40:38,679
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, or just like, you know, depending on what it is, is it a year's worth of events?

464
00:40:38,859 --> 00:40:43,401
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it a certain couple, you know, concentrated timeframe worth of events?

465
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:46,482
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, are we celebrating it for the whole year?

466
00:40:46,542 --> 00:40:48,223
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, do we know the actual date?

467
00:40:49,485 --> 00:40:56,931
[SPEAKER_03]: One, I don't know, it was sometimes like the formal charter came years later.

468
00:40:57,772 --> 00:41:00,194
[SPEAKER_02]: After I thought I thought it was sometime in the spring.

469
00:41:01,946 --> 00:41:18,073
[SPEAKER_03]: It's April, but I don't know when the specific grants came in, because there's the grant to Matthew Craddock, which is 162930, and then there's our founding, which we were not a community formally until like 1680.

470
00:41:18,153 --> 00:41:28,138
[SPEAKER_03]: So, in terms of Massachusetts government, but there was representation

471
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:34,525
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we're listed in many, many government things as meat for or mystic.

472
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:42,515
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can do some research and that will be some of the things that we lead up to is making sure that all the facts are correct.

473
00:41:43,476 --> 00:41:45,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think if every organization does 1 or 2 events.

474
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:49,541
[SPEAKER_03]: throughout the year, then, you know, there'd be enough to fill out a year.

475
00:41:50,481 --> 00:41:57,063
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think the city should, you know, we could be responsible for two, like I've done at a researcher house programs.

476
00:41:57,583 --> 00:41:58,943
[SPEAKER_03]: We can do walking tours.

477
00:41:59,003 --> 00:41:59,923
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not a problem.

478
00:42:00,303 --> 00:42:05,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Historical society did a couple of programs focused on various aspects of Medford history.

479
00:42:06,285 --> 00:42:09,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they, maybe the, it might be cool to do the history of the,

480
00:42:11,147 --> 00:42:22,698
[SPEAKER_03]: The 1930s celebration 100 years ago, and the way that they sell, you know, Lexington was just looking at their centennial and the way that they celebrated the bicentennial and all of that 100 years ago.

481
00:42:22,738 --> 00:42:23,599
[SPEAKER_03]: So that might be fun.

482
00:42:23,619 --> 00:42:26,261
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, because that's recent history.

483
00:42:26,982 --> 00:42:34,369
[SPEAKER_03]: We definitely the city should be responsible for an event a big event, like a big mystic river celebration, but maybe.

484
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:47,913
[SPEAKER_03]: rather than do those events separately or even at all, combine them all into one big mega event with people and music and all sorts of stuff.

485
00:42:47,993 --> 00:42:49,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do it a couple of times a year.

486
00:42:49,113 --> 00:42:49,513
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

487
00:42:49,973 --> 00:42:53,594
[SPEAKER_03]: There should definitely be a parade and there should definitely be fireworks.

488
00:42:54,294 --> 00:42:54,774
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

489
00:42:56,194 --> 00:42:56,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

490
00:42:57,094 --> 00:42:59,535
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of flushed out like we should have something

491
00:43:00,592 --> 00:43:08,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, every month and dovetail existing things, like, I had waited, like, the state picnic, like, that's something that already happens.

492
00:43:08,816 --> 00:43:11,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, maybe we can, like, oomph it up.

493
00:43:11,438 --> 00:43:17,881
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know if it's so much, like, lots and lots of new event planning.

494
00:43:17,981 --> 00:43:23,804
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a couple of new events peppered into pre-existing, you know, community anchor events.

495
00:43:26,045 --> 00:43:31,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I just looked it up too.

496
00:43:31,649 --> 00:43:34,151
[SPEAKER_03]: 2027 is the 175th anniversary of Tufts University.

497
00:43:34,732 --> 00:43:41,176
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would like to think that they will start celebrating themselves a little bit before that or leading up to that.

498
00:43:42,017 --> 00:43:51,824
[SPEAKER_03]: If not, that would be a good kickoff, real rock solid kickoff way to start celebrating Med for 400 is to start with one of the oldest institutions in the area.

499
00:43:51,844 --> 00:43:51,884
[SPEAKER_03]: So

500
00:43:53,809 --> 00:43:56,291
[SPEAKER_03]: and a good way to partner with Tufts.

501
00:43:57,152 --> 00:44:08,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Tufts has a lot of students, alumni, good way for Medford to maybe raise money and, you know, find ways to bring the kids into the programs, but also get something out of Tufts too as well.

502
00:44:08,663 --> 00:44:12,907
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and are they like bringing alumni, like famous alumni back for their celebration?

503
00:44:12,968 --> 00:44:15,690
[SPEAKER_12]: It could be a way to get some like- Money.

504
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:16,811
[SPEAKER_12]: Famous people to Medford.

505
00:44:19,135 --> 00:44:23,576
[SPEAKER_12]: Has, did you guys, did Townsend ever do anything, Ryan, when you were there?

506
00:44:23,957 --> 00:44:25,697
[SPEAKER_12]: Did they ever have one of these anniversaries?

507
00:44:25,717 --> 00:44:28,198
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they've had these anniversaries before.

508
00:44:29,258 --> 00:44:29,719
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not.

509
00:44:30,519 --> 00:44:32,599
[SPEAKER_03]: COVID happened in the middle of our big one, so.

510
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:40,962
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, and all the events right now are, like in Lexington, are leading up to Patriot's Day next year, right?

511
00:44:41,442 --> 00:44:43,103
[SPEAKER_12]: Like they have their big countdown in the Senate.

512
00:44:43,463 --> 00:44:45,824
[SPEAKER_12]: I drive through there every day on my way to my office.

513
00:44:47,063 --> 00:44:50,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it's the 250th anniversary has started.

514
00:44:50,445 --> 00:44:55,307
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, a countdown, like, I don't know if you've seen what Lexington's doing, Teresa.

515
00:44:55,327 --> 00:44:58,949
[SPEAKER_12]: They have like a big countdown board on their town green.

516
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:03,472
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll try to snap a picture of it when I drive through there.

517
00:45:03,872 --> 00:45:08,414
[SPEAKER_12]: In front of Town Hall, they're counting down to their big celebration.

518
00:45:08,434 --> 00:45:09,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.

519
00:45:10,992 --> 00:45:11,272
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

520
00:45:11,833 --> 00:45:18,778
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think like the city, the city of Boston, they're, they're 400 the same as ours, if I'm not mistaken, I think 1630.

521
00:45:18,818 --> 00:45:25,964
[SPEAKER_02]: So they already have like a logo and they're already putting their marketing out there.

522
00:45:26,064 --> 00:45:27,766
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and I know they have Boston money.

523
00:45:27,806 --> 00:45:33,090
[SPEAKER_02]: We do not, but you know, I think it's time for us to really start focusing in on this one.

524
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:37,694
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it starts with a committee of, as you said, Jen, you know, bring in,

525
00:45:38,178 --> 00:45:44,579
[SPEAKER_02]: chamber of historical society, bring in city folks, bring in, you know, just historical consultants who live in the area.

526
00:45:44,599 --> 00:45:55,081
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be really great to have clear density there, you know, um, and then kind of go from there, establish a wants desires of, of types of events.

527
00:45:55,201 --> 00:45:57,182
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from there we can establish a budget.

528
00:45:57,962 --> 00:46:03,203
[SPEAKER_02]: So it sounds like this is the, uh, the commission supporting this, which is great.

529
00:46:04,043 --> 00:46:07,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'm a bit of a party planner, event production,

530
00:46:08,995 --> 00:46:14,697
[SPEAKER_02]: planner by a former profession, so this is something that's exciting to me.

531
00:46:17,177 --> 00:46:19,078
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I think it could be super fun.

532
00:46:20,298 --> 00:46:31,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, in terms of next steps, I'm happy to reach out and I passed this briefly past the mayor, so I think she'd be open to having a discussion about this.

533
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:36,942
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll bring it to her attention and then get her blessing to start pulling

534
00:46:37,375 --> 00:46:39,195
[SPEAKER_02]: personalities together for the committee?

535
00:46:41,636 --> 00:46:42,456
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that sounds good.

536
00:46:42,476 --> 00:46:43,996
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

537
00:46:44,016 --> 00:47:04,300
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I mean, because there's like, we have the Brooks Estate, you know, there's Embelle, there's the Royal House, there's, you know, I mean, everything kind of overlaps with the society a little bit, but I think it's just a matter of how big is the committee and who, you know, like, you know, like, for example, like,

538
00:47:05,438 --> 00:47:18,764
[SPEAKER_12]: You know there's me like I sit here and I am on mbelt and then Doug's on CPC and he's on mbelt and like I think there's a fee, you know, and then obviously we're members of societies like it, it all kind of overlaps a little bit.

539
00:47:19,525 --> 00:47:19,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

540
00:47:20,205 --> 00:47:22,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'll see what the mayor may have.

541
00:47:22,566 --> 00:47:25,708
[SPEAKER_02]: She may have preference in seeing more chamber folks.

542
00:47:25,828 --> 00:47:26,308
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure.

543
00:47:26,328 --> 00:47:27,869
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just to kind of help share the

544
00:47:29,142 --> 00:47:31,744
[SPEAKER_02]: The labor, this is going to be a lot of work.

545
00:47:31,764 --> 00:47:36,008
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and I think you need to determine who's driving it, right?

546
00:47:36,088 --> 00:47:36,989
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it the chamber?

547
00:47:37,329 --> 00:47:39,431
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it the society?

548
00:47:39,611 --> 00:47:41,012
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it somebody?

549
00:47:41,032 --> 00:47:41,473
[SPEAKER_12]: City hall.

550
00:47:41,713 --> 00:47:42,273
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it, right.

551
00:47:42,373 --> 00:47:45,016
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it some, Alicia or somebody on her team?

552
00:47:45,116 --> 00:47:45,836
[SPEAKER_12]: Like whatever.

553
00:47:48,038 --> 00:47:48,258
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

554
00:47:48,539 --> 00:47:48,779
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

555
00:47:48,799 --> 00:47:49,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

556
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:49,840
[SPEAKER_02]: So my eyes get really big.

557
00:47:55,470 --> 00:48:01,072
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think starting with the mayor more earnestly in this conversation is the next step.

558
00:48:01,092 --> 00:48:08,196
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will do that and happy to come back and report out to this group or just provide like an administrative memo to keep you updated.

559
00:48:08,416 --> 00:48:09,716
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, keep us updated.

560
00:48:10,216 --> 00:48:12,798
[SPEAKER_12]: And you're right.

561
00:48:12,858 --> 00:48:14,778
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, the time is going to fly by.

562
00:48:14,838 --> 00:48:20,041
[SPEAKER_12]: So the sooner, you know, at least the committee gets formed, I think the better.

563
00:48:20,061 --> 00:48:21,501
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

564
00:48:22,642 --> 00:48:22,922
[SPEAKER_12]: Excellent.

565
00:48:23,502 --> 00:48:23,822
[SPEAKER_12]: Awesome.

566
00:48:23,902 --> 00:48:24,263
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks.

567
00:48:26,513 --> 00:48:26,813
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks.

568
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:30,476
[SPEAKER_12]: Do we have any more new business?

569
00:48:33,258 --> 00:48:33,539
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

570
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:35,700
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

571
00:48:36,201 --> 00:48:37,462
[SPEAKER_12]: Moving on to old business.

572
00:48:39,944 --> 00:48:41,345
[SPEAKER_12]: Properties under demo delay.

573
00:48:42,186 --> 00:48:46,209
[SPEAKER_12]: We did hear from 56 Wareham Street today.

574
00:48:46,229 --> 00:48:53,134
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we still need a little work on those plans, but I think the goal is to try to get them

575
00:48:55,045 --> 00:48:57,406
[SPEAKER_12]: done soon so that we can vote to lift them.

576
00:48:59,487 --> 00:49:00,948
[SPEAKER_12]: Ryan was gonna send them back a note.

577
00:49:01,429 --> 00:49:04,491
[SPEAKER_12]: Or were you gonna send that to Doug and- I'm gonna send it to Doug and Peter.

578
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:06,031
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't really change anything.

579
00:49:06,092 --> 00:49:10,714
[SPEAKER_03]: I asked them to push back the addition a little bit, but they didn't do anything, so.

580
00:49:10,734 --> 00:49:14,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

581
00:49:14,997 --> 00:49:17,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Were the plans any less diagrammatic kind of?

582
00:49:19,757 --> 00:49:29,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, yeah, yeah, I think they were before this was um, this was uh, This is not almond street almond street.

583
00:49:29,162 --> 00:49:31,543
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't even we got to set up a meeting with them.

584
00:49:31,563 --> 00:49:32,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wait.

585
00:49:32,223 --> 00:49:36,625
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, okay I'm getting i'm getting mixed up.

586
00:49:36,705 --> 00:49:41,707
[SPEAKER_03]: I think yeah anyway Yeah, no, I think where ham is pretty concise.

587
00:49:41,747 --> 00:49:42,528
[SPEAKER_03]: I just asked them to

588
00:49:44,138 --> 00:49:50,420
[SPEAKER_03]: push back the roof line a little bit so that it doesn't look like it's eating the old house, but they didn't.

589
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,561
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not thrilled with it.

590
00:49:54,621 --> 00:49:55,841
[SPEAKER_03]: So the rest of it looks fine.

591
00:49:56,021 --> 00:49:57,722
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, that's the only thing I want them to change.

592
00:49:57,742 --> 00:49:59,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

593
00:49:59,682 --> 00:50:07,785
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it should be, you know, a rehabilitation, not necessarily restoration, but also not necessarily development either.

594
00:50:07,805 --> 00:50:07,845
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

595
00:50:13,659 --> 00:50:14,940
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so next month, Jen.

596
00:50:15,481 --> 00:50:17,482
[SPEAKER_12]: OK, yeah.

597
00:50:19,244 --> 00:50:21,666
[SPEAKER_12]: OK, and yeah, and we have not heard from all months, so.

598
00:50:25,169 --> 00:50:25,509
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.

599
00:50:26,810 --> 00:50:29,272
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think we need to order any foreign bees tonight.

600
00:50:30,073 --> 00:50:36,238
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so we're there if one just.

601
00:50:36,518 --> 00:50:41,022
[SPEAKER_04]: 161 Maine went into open house this weekend and I did walk through.

602
00:50:42,545 --> 00:50:45,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless they're going to raise the roof, it's never going to come back to us.

603
00:50:47,129 --> 00:50:51,552
[SPEAKER_04]: The interior is in very good shape.

604
00:50:52,413 --> 00:50:54,855
[SPEAKER_04]: It was modernized for renewal a few years ago.

605
00:50:55,675 --> 00:51:02,941
[SPEAKER_04]: It was being used as an income property, and it's being sold as either a starter home or an income property at 715 Asking.

606
00:51:03,941 --> 00:51:08,465
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we had ordered a Form B, I don't think it's going to be

607
00:51:09,224 --> 00:51:13,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, absent a raised roof, which given the shape, it's not going to go that far.

608
00:51:13,529 --> 00:51:17,294
[SPEAKER_04]: I doubt it's ever going to come before us, at least on this.

609
00:51:17,314 --> 00:51:17,695
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

610
00:51:17,815 --> 00:51:24,984
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say it's covered in asbestos siding, so we have to do some sort of remediation if they decide to do that.

611
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:27,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise it'll just look wonky.

612
00:51:27,594 --> 00:51:31,977
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess they could go over it with vinyl, but that's such a did we already order one for that?

613
00:51:32,397 --> 00:51:38,321
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't ordered it yet, because I preemptively just sitting on it waiting to make sure that budget doesn't burn that we don't burn through our budget.

614
00:51:38,401 --> 00:51:40,782
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I mean, I mean, I agree with Ed.

615
00:51:40,883 --> 00:51:43,684
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's it's almost in too good of shape to.

616
00:51:43,744 --> 00:51:49,488
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know that it's a super threat, but yeah, I think maybe keep it on the list and if if you know.

617
00:51:49,508 --> 00:51:55,292
[SPEAKER_12]: If March comes in March and April come and we have a little extra, we can order it.

618
00:51:56,225 --> 00:51:56,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.

619
00:51:57,006 --> 00:52:01,628
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

620
00:52:01,728 --> 00:52:08,453
[SPEAKER_12]: And I haven't heard or seen, we haven't gotten any pings this month about kind of new things coming in, so.

621
00:52:09,814 --> 00:52:20,080
[SPEAKER_03]: If people see derelict properties and they want to bring them to our attention, you know, feel free to, you know, if you walk by something and say, hey, this condition isn't looking too favorable, maybe you should take a look at it.

622
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:21,261
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we're happy to do that.

623
00:52:22,061 --> 00:52:24,323
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and there haven't been any like,

624
00:52:25,344 --> 00:52:26,565
[SPEAKER_12]: attention developers.

625
00:52:27,426 --> 00:52:28,087
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

626
00:52:29,908 --> 00:52:31,970
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, there was one I don't I'll send it.

627
00:52:33,552 --> 00:52:34,613
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll look at it, Ryan.

628
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:36,214
[SPEAKER_12]: There was one that came on last week.

629
00:52:38,577 --> 00:52:41,539
[SPEAKER_12]: But everything that I've seen in the past couple weeks,

630
00:52:43,064 --> 00:52:54,874
[SPEAKER_12]: If it's shouting for a developer, it's because there's an extra lot or something buildable potentially that I don't know that it's necessarily a demo or teardown.

631
00:52:54,894 --> 00:52:58,136
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just adding something to something that's already there.

632
00:52:58,156 --> 00:53:02,300
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

633
00:53:03,441 --> 00:53:05,022
[SPEAKER_12]: Speaking of budgets, are we?

634
00:53:05,042 --> 00:53:07,044
[SPEAKER_03]: We're okay.

635
00:53:07,644 --> 00:53:07,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

636
00:53:07,865 --> 00:53:08,545
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

637
00:53:08,585 --> 00:53:09,126
[SPEAKER_03]: We're on our pace.

638
00:53:11,072 --> 00:53:15,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm going to put out to bid.

639
00:53:15,615 --> 00:53:20,037
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to review after we do the S&P.

640
00:53:20,057 --> 00:53:29,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Eleni and I are going to review what they call the scope of work, which is normally what we do for MHC's grant, but MHC didn't

641
00:53:29,923 --> 00:53:31,065
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't apply for an M.H.C.

642
00:53:31,085 --> 00:53:32,887
[SPEAKER_03]: grant last year because we missed the deadline.

643
00:53:33,327 --> 00:53:44,159
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're doing that work and we have a section picked out that's going to be the Sagamore Vale, which is Ashland, Water, Oakland street area.

644
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:45,962
[SPEAKER_03]: The consultants were pretty convinced that

645
00:53:48,042 --> 00:53:55,746
[SPEAKER_03]: I think 50 or so properties could be documented for the money that we have in our budget, which is $15,000 for that match.

646
00:53:55,846 --> 00:53:59,767
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll have to work and we will have to go out to bid.

647
00:53:59,848 --> 00:54:04,730
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just want to review scope of work after the S&P grant goes out.

648
00:54:06,471 --> 00:54:06,631
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.

649
00:54:07,791 --> 00:54:08,191
[SPEAKER_12]: OK, good.

650
00:54:11,847 --> 00:54:17,688
[SPEAKER_12]: Permit subcommittee, I sent a couple of things to Peter and Eleni this week, so thank you guys for getting back to me on that.

651
00:54:18,288 --> 00:54:21,869
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm actually going to meet with the building department on Wednesday.

652
00:54:22,449 --> 00:54:24,369
[SPEAKER_12]: They have a meeting every week.

653
00:54:24,549 --> 00:54:30,690
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been invited to come go sit with them and just kind of answer any questions, get to know them.

654
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:33,551
[SPEAKER_12]: They can know me, see I'm a real person.

655
00:54:33,571 --> 00:54:40,272
[SPEAKER_12]: If there's anything that you guys want me to relay,

656
00:54:41,935 --> 00:54:42,455
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me know.

657
00:54:42,475 --> 00:54:51,981
[SPEAKER_12]: I think I'm just going to kind of go over, you know, kind of talk generally about the things that... Should we start putting our business card back in the office?

658
00:54:53,422 --> 00:54:54,663
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah.

659
00:54:54,883 --> 00:54:55,964
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you have a stack of them?

660
00:54:56,284 --> 00:54:56,524
[SPEAKER_03]: I do.

661
00:54:56,784 --> 00:54:58,245
[SPEAKER_03]: I have all the boxes of them.

662
00:54:59,246 --> 00:55:01,487
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I don't know how many people go in anymore.

663
00:55:01,507 --> 00:55:03,368
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, all the permits are gone by now.

664
00:55:03,388 --> 00:55:04,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of people.

665
00:55:04,169 --> 00:55:05,650
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they do, but... Lots of people go in.

666
00:55:07,010 --> 00:55:07,431
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, yeah.

667
00:55:07,491 --> 00:55:07,931
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, all right.

668
00:55:07,951 --> 00:55:10,593
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I'll come grab some of those from you and bring them with me, but...

669
00:55:11,611 --> 00:55:17,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, just because then the guys will go, the guys will go, Oh, contact the historical commission and they'll go, how do I do that?

670
00:55:17,653 --> 00:55:19,133
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can say, here's the card.

671
00:55:20,714 --> 00:55:20,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

672
00:55:21,234 --> 00:55:26,456
[SPEAKER_02]: They, they, they do tend to send folks just right upstairs to Dennis and if he's available.

673
00:55:27,076 --> 00:55:30,037
[SPEAKER_02]: So it might be a nice addition to have them if you have some.

674
00:55:30,157 --> 00:55:30,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

675
00:55:31,417 --> 00:55:34,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want me to, uh, you want me to drop off a stack to you guys too, as well?

676
00:55:36,118 --> 00:55:37,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that, that would be great.

677
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:37,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

678
00:55:39,212 --> 00:56:00,902
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, my goal is to just kind of talk in general about the things that we really look for, about streetscape and changing roof lines, honoring what's there, things in the rear we typically aren't super concerned about.

679
00:56:03,528 --> 00:56:10,435
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, as long as the house kind of maintains what was there and what is there.

680
00:56:11,436 --> 00:56:23,207
[SPEAKER_12]: And I thought, Ryan, I'd bring that old memo that we wrote that kind of started this whole thing back, you know, what is a four or five years ago now, the examples that we had.

681
00:56:23,747 --> 00:56:28,532
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is from previous commissioners, previous, you know, folks in the department.

682
00:56:30,028 --> 00:56:44,693
[SPEAKER_12]: where it was just kind of like willy nilly of, of tearing things down and, and just, you know, anyway, I thought going to kind of just sharing a little history, uh, would kind of put us in, in context of how we got here.

683
00:56:44,793 --> 00:56:55,677
[SPEAKER_12]: But, um, anyway, if, if, if anything comes up between now and Wednesday four o'clock that you guys feel is important that I talk to them about, feel free to send it to me.

684
00:56:56,618 --> 00:56:57,118
[SPEAKER_12]: Otherwise,

685
00:56:58,659 --> 00:56:59,900
[SPEAKER_12]: Going into the lion's den.

686
00:57:04,904 --> 00:57:05,264
[SPEAKER_05]: Good luck.

687
00:57:06,165 --> 00:57:06,525
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks.

688
00:57:07,345 --> 00:57:07,586
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks.

689
00:57:07,786 --> 00:57:11,068
[SPEAKER_12]: If anyone wants to come, feel free to come with me.

690
00:57:13,290 --> 00:57:14,631
[SPEAKER_12]: But no, I think it'd be fine.

691
00:57:14,811 --> 00:57:16,032
[SPEAKER_12]: I tease.

692
00:57:16,312 --> 00:57:18,954
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, they're all good guys.

693
00:57:19,454 --> 00:57:20,975
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the things that I struggle with is

694
00:57:23,218 --> 00:57:34,424
[SPEAKER_12]: Lands right literally sometimes there's things like sketched on a napkin and like taking a picture and upload it into the system and you know I would like to hear from them in the sense of.

695
00:57:35,384 --> 00:57:37,666
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, these are acceptable no they aren't.

696
00:57:40,067 --> 00:57:43,349
[SPEAKER_12]: And what do they look for, because I think that that would be.

697
00:57:44,449 --> 00:57:46,671
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, obviously, I'm not a contractor.

698
00:57:46,691 --> 00:57:52,296
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know building codes, but, you know, what is the property owner required to do?

699
00:57:53,297 --> 00:57:56,479
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I feel like sometimes we get something to review and it's like.

700
00:57:57,607 --> 00:58:00,468
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, Eleni and Peter, you see it more, because I'll send you guys things.

701
00:58:00,509 --> 00:58:02,129
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm like, there's nothing here.

702
00:58:02,169 --> 00:58:03,170
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know what you're doing.

703
00:58:04,531 --> 00:58:15,056
[SPEAKER_12]: Even today, there was something I had to kind of send a note back on, because it said, we're putting a cover on and then making storage.

704
00:58:15,196 --> 00:58:17,777
[SPEAKER_12]: And there was no other information about that.

705
00:58:17,797 --> 00:58:20,939
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm like, can you just clarify what this is and where in the property?

706
00:58:20,999 --> 00:58:22,340
[SPEAKER_12]: Is this inside, outside?

707
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,642
[SPEAKER_12]: What's happening here in terms of the work?

708
00:58:26,322 --> 00:58:28,624
[SPEAKER_12]: Because it's probably something we don't care about, but.

709
00:58:29,845 --> 00:58:31,266
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I don't know.

710
00:58:31,366 --> 00:58:34,109
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you tearing down a carriage house like it was so ambiguous?

711
00:58:36,831 --> 00:58:40,894
[SPEAKER_12]: So anyway, so I will let you guys know how that goes.

712
00:58:43,276 --> 00:58:44,597
[SPEAKER_12]: Ryan Cross Street Cemetery.

713
00:58:46,118 --> 00:58:48,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Teresa, are you there?

714
00:58:49,621 --> 00:58:50,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Perchance I am.

715
00:58:51,968 --> 00:58:57,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Have we heard back from Fiona on where she is with the contract with PAL?

716
00:58:58,892 --> 00:59:01,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, she and I connected last week.

717
00:59:01,533 --> 00:59:04,494
[SPEAKER_02]: She said that she hopes to send this out early this week.

718
00:59:05,155 --> 00:59:05,975
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave her today.

719
00:59:06,035 --> 00:59:07,456
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to nudge her tomorrow.

720
00:59:08,076 --> 00:59:13,919
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the contract, not necessarily the bidding work, or does that also include the bidding work?

721
00:59:17,021 --> 00:59:19,702
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe the bidding work was already pushed out.

722
00:59:20,142 --> 00:59:20,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, OK.

723
00:59:23,511 --> 00:59:27,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Responses she told me she was thought out mid last week.

724
00:59:27,654 --> 00:59:34,058
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really bad advertiser for 2 weeks and maybe mid next week on the bidding aspect, but the contract.

725
00:59:35,178 --> 00:59:35,719
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get it out.

726
00:59:35,799 --> 00:59:36,579
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll make sure it gets out.

727
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:39,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, before I leave for vacation.

728
00:59:40,161 --> 00:59:42,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so there you have it.

729
00:59:43,733 --> 00:59:44,793
[SPEAKER_03]: She knew everything that I knew.

730
00:59:44,814 --> 00:59:49,135
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, so thanks for letting me know.

731
00:59:49,235 --> 01:00:02,201
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm yeah, so I'm looking forward to getting PAO under contract so that we can then get moving on that work and then they have to apply for the state level permitting.

732
01:00:03,402 --> 01:00:05,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Then there's going to be some.

733
01:00:06,403 --> 01:00:15,575
[SPEAKER_03]: uh lag time while they put together their report to the state if the state has any questions there'll be some additional lag time and then we will hopefully be going in the ground so

734
01:00:16,316 --> 01:00:21,519
[SPEAKER_12]: Will they do that in the winter or will we automatically be delayed to like March?

735
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:23,561
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have an answer.

736
01:00:23,581 --> 01:00:37,669
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to think that as long as they can excavate so just so people know for construction purposes, you can probably dig safely well into January and not hit any sort of frost in the ground.

737
01:00:38,190 --> 01:00:41,652
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes it hairy to pour foundations, but you can definitely go in the ground.

738
01:00:41,672 --> 01:00:42,733
[SPEAKER_03]: The ground is still soft.

739
01:00:42,773 --> 01:00:44,494
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not fully frozen until.

740
01:00:45,843 --> 01:00:48,183
[SPEAKER_03]: almost late January, early February.

741
01:00:48,243 --> 01:00:50,384
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are really the months.

742
01:00:50,424 --> 01:00:54,465
[SPEAKER_03]: So we don't get in ground by, I would say, Christmas.

743
01:00:54,745 --> 01:00:58,145
[SPEAKER_03]: There'll be a low for the holiday and we won't be getting in the ground until April.

744
01:00:59,026 --> 01:01:11,748
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how that impacts the RFP process that's gone out on the parcels, but my understanding is that the RFP is just to seek a development proposal, right?

745
01:01:14,378 --> 01:01:23,123
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it a single, I didn't look at it yet, I probably should, but is it a singular proposal for each parcel or is it the whole concept?

746
01:01:23,723 --> 01:01:31,307
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it's a concept plan that they're asking for, but don't hold me to that, that's my understanding.

747
01:01:31,387 --> 01:01:41,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so we'll be looking at various proposals from various teams on what could or could not go there and the city can certainly pick and choose and then they'll

748
01:01:42,908 --> 01:01:43,849
[SPEAKER_03]: figure out what they want.

749
01:01:43,869 --> 01:01:49,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this for the downtown project?

750
01:01:49,551 --> 01:01:57,356
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the downtown archaeological dig at the former cemetery parcel as it relates to the development proposal that went out.

751
01:01:58,596 --> 01:02:00,137
[SPEAKER_12]: Or the parking lot parcel.

752
01:02:00,157 --> 01:02:04,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that is sparking a hot topic on parking in the city of Medford right now.

753
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:05,560
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

754
01:02:07,401 --> 01:02:07,841
[SPEAKER_02]: That it is.

755
01:02:09,992 --> 01:02:15,014
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just going to add that that's also my understanding of excavation work.

756
01:02:15,834 --> 01:02:18,015
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that timeline that Ryan presented.

757
01:02:18,095 --> 01:02:22,297
[SPEAKER_02]: I had heard until February, but I think we're about a mile out there.

758
01:02:23,177 --> 01:02:24,878
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, as long as the excavator can get through.

759
01:02:24,918 --> 01:02:32,221
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think it's a question of whether or not it's an ideal condition for the archaeologists and digging excavation.

760
01:02:32,241 --> 01:02:33,981
[SPEAKER_02]: That was going to be my concern, too.

761
01:02:34,341 --> 01:02:38,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, if the ground is great enough for us to peel back that top layer,

762
01:02:40,780 --> 01:02:42,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so a concern there as well.

763
01:02:43,962 --> 01:02:49,804
[SPEAKER_02]: But the contract is going to get out, so at least that triggers the timeline that you presented out, Ryan.

764
01:02:51,005 --> 01:02:51,245
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

765
01:02:51,525 --> 01:02:52,865
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we'll get it out this week.

766
01:02:53,486 --> 01:02:54,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

767
01:02:55,586 --> 01:02:56,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Okey-dokey.

768
01:02:56,947 --> 01:03:03,050
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, Thomas Brooks Park, we have a public meeting on the calendar for October 22nd.

769
01:03:04,802 --> 01:03:13,946
[SPEAKER_12]: So commissioners, if you are available and would love to join us, we're going to be reviewing the project to date with the public.

770
01:03:14,206 --> 01:03:19,628
[SPEAKER_12]: Peter is going to talk about the archaeological cap ideas that we had already discussed.

771
01:03:20,428 --> 01:03:25,632
[SPEAKER_12]: kind of just give folks a general update and take any questions, feedback, et cetera.

772
01:03:26,333 --> 01:03:27,654
[SPEAKER_12]: Did I miss anything, Ryan, on that?

773
01:03:28,114 --> 01:03:30,276
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be on Zoom.

774
01:03:30,316 --> 01:03:34,979
[SPEAKER_12]: Just to make it easier, we could not get the, the library is booked every night this month.

775
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:37,701
[SPEAKER_12]: So we could not get the room at the library.

776
01:03:37,781 --> 01:03:38,662
[SPEAKER_12]: So Zoom it is.

777
01:03:39,463 --> 01:03:40,924
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything, everywhere.

778
01:03:41,244 --> 01:03:42,365
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh my God, it's bananas.

779
01:03:42,845 --> 01:03:43,065
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

780
01:03:45,467 --> 01:03:46,088
[SPEAKER_12]: It's all good though.

781
01:03:46,168 --> 01:03:47,369
[SPEAKER_12]: There's lots of good things happening here.

782
01:03:49,332 --> 01:03:51,393
[SPEAKER_12]: So anyway, so that'll be an exciting meeting.

783
01:03:51,553 --> 01:03:56,056
[SPEAKER_12]: And we should probably send out an email, Ryan.

784
01:03:56,076 --> 01:04:05,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a, Theresa, is there a process for a Captain Barry call?

785
01:04:05,382 --> 01:04:06,763
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yeah, can we get a representative?

786
01:04:06,883 --> 01:04:11,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Or a mayor call for that particular neighborhood, and we can just target the.

787
01:04:11,906 --> 01:04:17,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, yep, I can help facilitate that, but Steve's community is our director of communications.

788
01:04:18,490 --> 01:04:21,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, he, he manages the robo calls and alerts.

789
01:04:21,673 --> 01:04:21,913
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

790
01:04:23,094 --> 01:04:31,380
[SPEAKER_02]: He would be feel free to send it to me and I can send it along to him, but in case I. Disappear hit by a bus, Steve can help with that.

791
01:04:31,420 --> 01:04:38,025
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, I'll, I'll, I'll send that to you when I. Did we file a formal agenda Ryan?

792
01:04:40,204 --> 01:04:42,666
[SPEAKER_03]: That depends on I guess I could just file it.

793
01:04:42,746 --> 01:04:47,790
[SPEAKER_12]: We probably should only because the last time we had a public meeting about the park.

794
01:04:48,570 --> 01:04:51,592
[SPEAKER_12]: Somebody complained that they couldn't find it on the city calendar.

795
01:04:51,612 --> 01:04:56,976
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if the agenda is the trigger point to getting on the calendar.

796
01:04:59,438 --> 01:05:00,659
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have just the public.

797
01:05:01,186 --> 01:05:11,093
[SPEAKER_02]: event, like if you go to the calendar right now, for instance, there's a great, uh, I'll plug a Hispanic pop-up restaurant that's happening this Friday, um, at the West Medford community center.

798
01:05:11,113 --> 01:05:17,757
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want your, your public community event, um, you can also send it again to speak community.

799
01:05:18,358 --> 01:05:18,638
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

800
01:05:18,658 --> 01:05:19,038
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

801
01:05:19,098 --> 01:05:22,841
[SPEAKER_12]: I think, I mean, we have the zoom meeting, so we should at least have that.

802
01:05:22,881 --> 01:05:25,643
[SPEAKER_12]: So people can download it and have the zoom meeting info.

803
01:05:26,043 --> 01:05:26,223
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

804
01:05:27,430 --> 01:05:39,958
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, OK, OK, all right, we can make that definitely make that happen.

805
01:05:42,159 --> 01:05:42,359
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.

806
01:05:42,799 --> 01:05:51,805
[SPEAKER_12]: And then after that meeting, Ryan, what will our next steps be for finalize that plan and add it as an amendment to the master plan?

807
01:05:52,445 --> 01:05:52,866
[SPEAKER_12]: Right, OK.

808
01:05:54,215 --> 01:06:07,922
[SPEAKER_03]: perhaps seek estimates for work, and then we are going to start the very long process of working with various city departments to bid all of the public work for Thomas Brooks Park Phase 2.

809
01:06:08,643 --> 01:06:15,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Teresa will absolutely need your help, along with Fiona, because it will be a beast.

810
01:06:17,167 --> 01:06:18,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking forward to it.

811
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:39,069
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hoping that the various city departments that would be involved with this traffic and DPW and all those parks will have a lot of the tools that we need, basically standardized stuff that they're using across the city that we can then dump into a standard set of specifications.

812
01:06:39,450 --> 01:06:41,290
[SPEAKER_03]: So not reinventing the wheel.

813
01:06:42,651 --> 01:06:42,751
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

814
01:06:47,417 --> 01:06:49,718
[SPEAKER_12]: Great, good updates there.

815
01:06:51,239 --> 01:06:54,461
[SPEAKER_12]: Survey projects, you guys kind of already talked about that a little bit.

816
01:06:54,481 --> 01:06:56,523
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to put in for a new survey.

817
01:06:56,543 --> 01:07:02,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Lenny, did you have a chance to review the, are you going to send me comments?

818
01:07:04,127 --> 01:07:06,829
[SPEAKER_14]: I did, I just remembered that today.

819
01:07:06,909 --> 01:07:12,753
[SPEAKER_14]: I read through it and it seems pretty good for, you know, one pager and I guess when we submit the

820
01:07:13,638 --> 01:07:17,840
[SPEAKER_14]: If we get asked to submit the larger application, I'd be happy to work with you on that.

821
01:07:17,860 --> 01:07:19,641
[SPEAKER_14]: But I thought it looked good.

822
01:07:21,242 --> 01:07:22,263
[SPEAKER_12]: What does the one pager do?

823
01:07:23,248 --> 01:07:25,389
[SPEAKER_03]: November 15th, but I'm going to send it ASAP.

824
01:07:26,490 --> 01:07:29,272
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's, I just want to get it off my plate.

825
01:07:29,792 --> 01:07:34,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a, that one we're looking to do the Hastings Heights neighborhood.

826
01:07:34,455 --> 01:07:40,618
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a huge gap in survey in West Medford between the Marm-Simons Historic District and West Medford Square.

827
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:47,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Tons of pre-1900 buildings there that were developed, a large amount of them being single families.

828
01:07:47,702 --> 01:07:47,902
[SPEAKER_03]: So

829
01:07:49,243 --> 01:07:50,644
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be a great neighborhood to do.

830
01:07:51,125 --> 01:07:53,167
[SPEAKER_03]: They've already previously approved the project.

831
01:07:54,508 --> 01:07:58,832
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're kind of going back and asking them again to just make sure that that's still a priority.

832
01:07:59,513 --> 01:08:04,317
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hoping it is because this year the priorities are a little bit different as survey work is not their top priority.

833
01:08:04,377 --> 01:08:09,362
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually planning, but we're a city that was in dire need of.

834
01:08:10,797 --> 01:08:14,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Inventory, so I'm kind of hoping that they'll prioritize that.

835
01:08:14,718 --> 01:08:19,520
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus, we're executing a plan that's been well implemented over the last decade.

836
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:22,441
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm hoping that they'll see past that.

837
01:08:22,461 --> 01:08:25,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus, we're a CLG, so we're usually guaranteed to get funding.

838
01:08:25,842 --> 01:08:33,065
[SPEAKER_03]: But if we don't, then we will move forward with a lesser dollar amount and just do other survey.

839
01:08:35,624 --> 01:08:35,904
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

840
01:08:36,725 --> 01:08:37,185
[SPEAKER_12]: It's exciting.

841
01:08:37,205 --> 01:08:41,087
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll be nice to have a new project for that since we took this year off.

842
01:08:41,588 --> 01:08:41,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

843
01:08:42,288 --> 01:08:42,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

844
01:08:42,728 --> 01:08:43,989
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, yeah, kind of.

845
01:08:44,209 --> 01:08:45,890
[SPEAKER_12]: We were forced to take this year off.

846
01:08:46,050 --> 01:08:47,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we we are catching up, right?

847
01:08:47,892 --> 01:08:52,835
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're making sure that we're getting back on a normal schedule after COVID and all that stuff.

848
01:08:52,895 --> 01:08:55,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus, you know, and the budget won't get done.

849
01:08:56,017 --> 01:08:57,998
