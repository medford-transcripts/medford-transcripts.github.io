59
00:04:22,573 --> 00:04:27,318
[SPEAKER_42]: So before we begin, I just want to run down the agenda for tonight's meeting.

60
00:04:27,338 --> 00:04:32,584
[SPEAKER_42]: We're going to be continuing our public hearing on neighborhood and urban residential zoning districts.

61
00:04:32,944 --> 00:04:40,712
[SPEAKER_42]: I know that's why a lot of you are here and have joined virtually, so thank you for that, as well as opening a new hearing on accessory dwelling units or ADUs.

62
00:04:42,361 --> 00:04:44,061
[SPEAKER_42]: We're going to open these public hearings together.

63
00:04:44,081 --> 00:04:48,523
[SPEAKER_42]: We're going to hear a presentation from Emily and Paula of Innocent Associates.

64
00:04:48,543 --> 00:04:54,144
[SPEAKER_42]: We're going to take board and public comments on both topics at once.

65
00:04:54,664 --> 00:05:02,546
[SPEAKER_42]: We do have sign up sheets in the back where you can indicate what topic, it could be both, you want to comment on.

66
00:05:02,786 --> 00:05:08,208
[SPEAKER_42]: And we're just going to do this to help manage public comment and make sure that we're providing enough space

67
00:05:10,328 --> 00:05:12,811
[SPEAKER_42]: for all of us to provide comment this evening.

68
00:05:17,335 --> 00:05:21,480
[SPEAKER_42]: As you can see, we anticipate a lot of public participation, which is good.

69
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,862
[SPEAKER_42]: We want to emphasize this is good for Medford.

70
00:05:26,932 --> 00:05:32,495
[SPEAKER_42]: I do plan to take a short recess around 8.15, 8.30, depending on how the evening goes.

71
00:05:32,515 --> 00:05:34,896
[SPEAKER_42]: That'll be about 10, 15 minutes.

72
00:05:35,837 --> 00:05:37,958
[SPEAKER_42]: If you need to leave for any point, we're all adults.

73
00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:40,039
[SPEAKER_42]: Please take care of yourselves.

74
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:50,465
[SPEAKER_42]: But then right around 10 o'clock, we're going to take a step back and reassess, do we have enough time and mental capacity as a group

75
00:05:50,905 --> 00:05:55,726
[SPEAKER_42]: to continue to hear public comment or do we need to continue this to another date?

76
00:05:56,586 --> 00:06:00,187
[SPEAKER_42]: I know that's not ideal, but we have so much feedback to hear.

77
00:06:00,587 --> 00:06:05,608
[SPEAKER_42]: We don't want anyone to be shortchanged or anybody to not have their voice heard.

78
00:06:06,428 --> 00:06:13,670
[SPEAKER_42]: So just giving everybody a heads up, around 10 o'clock, we're gonna take a beat and kind of reassess what our plan should be moving forward.

79
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:19,211
[SPEAKER_42]: So the two options there could be to vote these topics out of the Community Development Board,

80
00:06:20,466 --> 00:06:21,828
[SPEAKER_42]: or continue to a date certain.

81
00:06:22,369 --> 00:06:23,931
[SPEAKER_42]: So those are kind of the two options.

82
00:06:25,493 --> 00:06:31,221
[SPEAKER_42]: And again, we wanna make sure we're able to listen and digest and respect your feedback, everybody's feedback.

83
00:06:43,275 --> 00:06:50,399
[SPEAKER_42]: So what I'm gonna do first is read the public notice for the ADU agenda item into the record.

84
00:06:50,419 --> 00:06:55,461
[SPEAKER_42]: Let's see.

85
00:06:57,538 --> 00:07:03,522
[SPEAKER_42]: This is the part that you guys probably usually take a water bathroom break during, but thank you for being here in person.

86
00:07:04,823 --> 00:07:18,093
[SPEAKER_42]: So the next item we're gonna hear first is a combination of the accessory dwelling units presentation, as well as a continuation of public hearing for neighborhood residential, urban residential zoning amendment.

87
00:07:21,435 --> 00:07:24,878
[SPEAKER_42]: The ADU is a new public hearing, so I'm gonna read the public hearing notice into the record.

88
00:07:26,472 --> 00:07:32,157
[SPEAKER_42]: The Medford Community Development Board shall conduct a public hearing on June 18th, 2025, after 6.30 p.m.

89
00:07:32,417 --> 00:07:46,748

[SPEAKER_42]: Amend section 94-8.2, Accessory Dwelling Units, to comply with MGL

96
00:08:54,832 --> 00:08:59,597
[SPEAKER_42]: So I would like to ask staff if they have any introductory comments before I hand it off to Innocent Associates.

97
00:09:00,558 --> 00:09:00,678
[SPEAKER_42]: No.

98
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:01,619
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay, great.

00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:07,424
[SPEAKER_42]: Emily and Paola, would you be able to do the presentation on accessory dwelling units?

100
00:09:08,025 --> 00:09:08,305
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

101
00:09:11,239 --> 00:09:18,946
[SPEAKER_25]: So with your permission, Madam Chair, we would like to have the accessory dwelling units first, and then take you through the rest of the information.

102
00:09:19,446 --> 00:09:21,208
[SPEAKER_25]: While palace sharing her screen.

103
00:09:22,149 --> 00:09:29,335
[SPEAKER_25]: For the record, my name is Emily Ennis of Innes Associates and I'm here with my colleague Palo Ramos Martinez, who is our chief resilience officer.

104
00:09:30,056 --> 00:09:31,377
[SPEAKER_25]: You want to go to the next slide please.

105
00:09:34,319 --> 00:09:38,062
[SPEAKER_25]: It takes a second or two to for the for the internet elves to run up and back.

106
00:09:38,922 --> 00:09:44,987
[SPEAKER_25]: So we're going to go very quickly through the first part the process timelines public comments I think everybody's seen that before.

107
00:09:45,007 --> 00:09:50,330
[SPEAKER_25]: I will then turn it over to Paula for the accessory dwelling units and the residential districts.

108
00:09:51,671 --> 00:09:58,176
[SPEAKER_25]: The timeline since March we've been working on this for a little bit over a year now for all of the city zoning updates.

109
00:09:59,637 --> 00:10:05,922
[SPEAKER_25]: The timeline since March has been as you see here, the blue are the meetings with the planning and permitting committee.

110
00:10:06,423 --> 00:10:16,351
[SPEAKER_25]: The black are the Community Development Board meetings and the green meetings are those special meetings that we've had as public listening sessions on the different topics.

111
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:26,267
[SPEAKER_25]: While we will have many more meetings, I am sure over the next few months, the current one that is scheduled is with yourselves next week.

112
00:10:26,347 --> 00:10:28,952
[SPEAKER_25]: The current anticipated topic is the squares.

113
00:10:31,141 --> 00:10:42,746
[SPEAKER_25]: All of this comes out of two main documents, the Medford Massachusetts Comprehensive Plan, which was approved in January 2023, and the Climate Action and Adaptation Plan.

114
00:10:42,806 --> 00:10:46,408
[SPEAKER_25]: Both of those had recommendations for zoning changes in them.

115
00:10:47,228 --> 00:10:54,531
[SPEAKER_25]: The city has actually been working on the zoning ordinance since the recodification process began back in to 2020.

116
00:10:57,112 --> 00:11:10,655
[SPEAKER_25]: And you can recording in progress map some of the things that we have discussed in the past, this idea of these quarters, squares, neighborhoods, as we're talking about today, and other areas.

117
00:11:11,415 --> 00:11:16,677
[SPEAKER_25]: I do want to point people to an interactive map that we have created online.

118
00:11:17,017 --> 00:11:21,578
[SPEAKER_25]: All of the maps that you see today can be created by going online.

119
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:26,500
[SPEAKER_25]: There is at the site that was mentioned earlier the city's own zoning site.

120
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:43,347
[SPEAKER_25]: There is a tutorial that has been shown on there, and you can go to the interactive map by clicking either on this link, and this will also be up on the website, probably on Friday or by clicking or by taking a picture of the QR code.

121
00:11:44,227 --> 00:11:54,474
[SPEAKER_25]: Before we get started, I just want to say, or before I turn it over to Paula, I just want to say that actually a lot of the information in this presentation has been presented to the board before.

122
00:11:54,494 --> 00:11:57,456
[SPEAKER_25]: We will go fairly quickly over that.

123
00:11:57,496 --> 00:11:58,596
[SPEAKER_25]: We have a lot of slides.

124
00:11:58,636 --> 00:12:04,400
[SPEAKER_25]: We have a lot of people, and congratulations to the city for having so many people come to this.

125
00:12:04,821 --> 00:12:08,323
[SPEAKER_25]: We are thrilled to see this many people both in person and online.

126
00:12:08,783 --> 00:12:11,806
[SPEAKER_25]: So we'll go quickly through the pieces that you've seen before.

127
00:12:11,866 --> 00:12:17,191
[SPEAKER_25]: We would, of course, at the board's direction or the chair's direction, be happy to return to any of that.

128
00:12:17,591 --> 00:12:21,415
[SPEAKER_25]: We will slow down a little bit on those things that you have not seen before.

129
00:12:21,835 --> 00:12:26,519
[SPEAKER_25]: And again, this will be available for people to see at a later date, but much of this is already online.

130
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,382
[SPEAKER_25]: With that, I'm going to turn it over to Bella.

131
00:12:34,127 --> 00:12:35,148
[SPEAKER_33]: Hello, everyone.

132
00:12:35,428 --> 00:12:36,629
[SPEAKER_33]: I hope you hear me well.

133
00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:40,132
[SPEAKER_33]: I can get more close to the mic.

134
00:12:42,374 --> 00:12:44,576
[SPEAKER_33]: There we go.

135
00:12:45,236 --> 00:12:53,744
[SPEAKER_33]: So what we're going to show first, and just let me say first that I'm also very glad that we have so many people joining.

136
00:12:53,764 --> 00:12:56,526
[SPEAKER_33]: This is really what we wanted from the very beginning.

137
00:12:57,047 --> 00:12:59,869
[SPEAKER_33]: So if it's the first time, welcome.

138
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:01,691
[SPEAKER_33]: enjoy.

139
00:13:01,711 --> 00:13:08,020
[SPEAKER_33]: Um, and so what we're going to start presenting is those maps that we have seen.

140
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:10,684
[SPEAKER_33]: First we want to look into.

141
00:13:11,585 --> 00:13:12,687
[SPEAKER_33]: We're going to see two maps.

142
00:13:12,767 --> 00:13:15,912
[SPEAKER_33]: The first one is the map that has been recommended

143
00:13:17,013 --> 00:13:19,255
[SPEAKER_33]: the city council to the city board.

144
00:13:20,356 --> 00:13:31,467
[SPEAKER_33]: Is the one you see here, and we have five different residential districts that we propose in the in Medford.

145
00:13:32,608 --> 00:13:40,195
[SPEAKER_33]: We have neighborhood residential one neighborhood residential to neighborhood residential three urban residential one and urban residential to

146
00:13:41,476 --> 00:13:47,618
[SPEAKER_33]: Um, so we will talk about what does that mean in the later, um, slides.

147
00:13:48,238 --> 00:13:50,999
[SPEAKER_33]: But just so we know this is the first map.

148
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:53,819
[SPEAKER_33]: This is the map that was referred from the city council.

149
00:13:54,580 --> 00:14:03,502
[SPEAKER_33]: And after I think this is the fifth time we're looking into this topic at the city community develop at the community development board.

150
00:14:04,402 --> 00:14:16,912
[SPEAKER_33]: we have been working in a different map with the Community Development Board input, sorry, and also the public and public feedback.

151
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:22,987
[SPEAKER_33]: Um so the first topic that we're going to talk is the accessory dwelling units.

152
00:14:23,127 --> 00:14:29,932
[SPEAKER_33]: This is a topic that we've already as Emily mentioned, we've already, um, shown, um, to the community

153
00:14:36,817 --> 00:14:42,238
[SPEAKER_33]: mentioned that there is an accessory dwelling unit guidebook that is done by the city of Boston.

154
00:14:42,658 --> 00:14:45,739
[SPEAKER_33]: It is very complete and has many different examples.

155
00:14:46,199 --> 00:15:00,142
[SPEAKER_33]: It has the definition, what it has to accomplish, what typologies there could be for small lots, medium lots, and bigger lots.

156
00:15:00,782 --> 00:15:05,983
[SPEAKER_33]: And so if anyone is interested in this topic, they have many, many examples.

157
00:15:07,424 --> 00:15:20,463
[SPEAKER_33]: Um so we are talking about accessory dwelling unit because on February, the state passed a law about a protected use accessory dwelling unit.

158
00:15:21,124 --> 00:15:22,005
[SPEAKER_33]: So, um.

159
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:35,676
[SPEAKER_33]: METFOR already had an ordinance about ADUs, but now it needs to be aligned with that new regulation that the state has published.

160
00:15:36,256 --> 00:15:44,462
[SPEAKER_33]: And so there are some prohibited regulations that the municipality cannot really regulate, that comes from the state law.

161
00:15:45,143 --> 00:15:48,165
[SPEAKER_33]: And those are owner occupancy requirement,

162
00:15:48,325 --> 00:15:56,531
[SPEAKER_33]: and occupancy restriction, minimum parking requirement, minimum parking requirement, use and occupancy restriction, unique caps and density and then the relationship to principal dwelling.

163
00:15:57,171 --> 00:16:04,576
[SPEAKER_33]: Um so all these regulations that you had some in your current regulation needs to, um, not be there.

164
00:16:04,616 --> 00:16:06,878
[SPEAKER_33]: So what we're doing is looking into that.

165
00:16:06,898 --> 00:16:09,260
[SPEAKER_33]: Um and proposing a new

166
00:16:14,403 --> 00:16:24,313
[SPEAKER_33]: Um, what are the municipality decisions that are there is allowing accessory dwelling units in any residential districts right now is for single residential.

167
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:27,377
[SPEAKER_33]: Um, what they call single residential districts.

168
00:16:28,117 --> 00:16:33,303
[SPEAKER_33]: But we're also could be allowed that local 80 you not the protected use.

169
00:16:33,863 --> 00:16:34,983
[SPEAKER_33]: allow bigger ideas.

170
00:16:35,324 --> 00:16:44,126
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm sorry, allow additional ideas more than one by a special permit and also restrictions or prohibitions on short term rental.

171
00:16:44,146 --> 00:16:49,468
[SPEAKER_33]: So those are mainly the things that local municipality can decide.

172
00:16:51,527 --> 00:16:56,733
[SPEAKER_33]: So for the protected ADUs, we have dimensional standards.

173
00:16:57,273 --> 00:17:07,505
[SPEAKER_33]: Those are not to be larger than 900 square foot or half of the gross floor area of the principal dwelling, whichever is smaller.

174
00:17:08,586 --> 00:17:21,375
[SPEAKER_33]: Um, the dimensionally standards, um, cannot be more restrictive than those that are required for principal dwelling, single family residential or accessory structure.

175
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:28,720
[SPEAKER_33]: And that is the section where you have all those mentioned requirements for accessory structures in your current zoning section 94 dash 4.3.

176
00:17:31,362 --> 00:17:48,592
[SPEAKER_33]: and then for off street parking, there shall be one additional for ADUs located outside half mile radius of any transit station, and no additional parking for ADUs located within half a mile radius of any transit station.

177
00:17:49,213 --> 00:17:57,378
[SPEAKER_33]: These two can be more permissive, but we cannot require more than what they are having here.

178
00:17:58,398 --> 00:18:05,082
[SPEAKER_33]: Um, so these are the, um, the requirements for protected uses.

179
00:18:05,783 --> 00:18:06,984
[SPEAKER_33]: Um, locally to use.

180
00:18:07,464 --> 00:18:08,805
[SPEAKER_33]: We have the same requirements.

181
00:18:09,585 --> 00:18:20,472
[SPEAKER_33]: The local ladies, um, as we have discussed before, are those 80 years that can be allowed in presidential districts that do not have

182
00:18:20,872 --> 00:18:24,913
[SPEAKER_33]: that we are talking about is a single family, um, unit.

183
00:18:25,873 --> 00:18:33,195
[SPEAKER_33]: So, for example, in the districts that we are talking and we will talk about would be, um you are one and you are two.

184
00:18:33,715 --> 00:18:36,576
[SPEAKER_33]: And so for those any single

185
00:18:45,219 --> 00:18:48,160
[SPEAKER_33]: So the requirements are the same as the protected use.

186
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:53,622
[SPEAKER_33]: And then there is also a special permit, local ADU.

187
00:18:53,822 --> 00:19:00,365
[SPEAKER_33]: So if anyone wants to add a second ADU, that has to be a special permit.

188
00:19:00,665 --> 00:19:09,208
[SPEAKER_33]: So it has to go through the city board and the requirements are the same as the protected ADU and the local by right ADU.

189
00:19:10,665 --> 00:19:13,647
[SPEAKER_33]: So what does it mean for all of the, um.

190
00:19:14,908 --> 00:19:16,210
[SPEAKER_33]: All of the desk districts.

191
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:17,731
[SPEAKER_33]: We have enter one.

192
00:19:18,131 --> 00:19:23,916
[SPEAKER_33]: The permitted building types in enter one is single unit dwelling and then the historic conversion.

193
00:19:24,116 --> 00:19:24,416
[SPEAKER_33]: We can.

194
00:19:24,616 --> 00:19:25,957
[SPEAKER_33]: We will also talk about that.

195
00:19:26,138 --> 00:19:35,045
[SPEAKER_33]: What that is later, but mainly is those big historic houses that can be converted into multi unit.

196
00:19:35,685 --> 00:19:38,446
[SPEAKER_33]: or more than at least one.

197
00:19:39,786 --> 00:19:41,686
[SPEAKER_33]: We will see more of these specifics later on.

198
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:47,067
[SPEAKER_33]: So in the NR1, we have single unit dwelling, historic conversion.

199
00:19:48,067 --> 00:19:52,788
[SPEAKER_33]: Because we have a single unit dwelling, then we do have a protected use ADU.

200
00:19:53,409 --> 00:19:54,189
[SPEAKER_33]: So we have that.

201
00:19:54,609 --> 00:19:56,209
[SPEAKER_33]: That is allowed.

202
00:19:56,849 --> 00:20:00,050
[SPEAKER_33]: And then we could have another one by special permit.

203
00:20:01,311 --> 00:20:06,539
[SPEAKER_33]: In NR2, we have single unit, two unit, and then historic conversion.

204
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:15,933
[SPEAKER_33]: Here as well, because we do have the single unit, we can allow a protected ADU, and then a second by a special permit.

205
00:20:16,894 --> 00:20:24,318
[SPEAKER_33]: and our three we have single two unit three unit and historic conversion again because we have that single unit.

206
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:29,802
[SPEAKER_33]: We have protected 80 you and then another one only by a special permit.

207
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:31,503
[SPEAKER_33]: And then you are one.

208
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:35,225
[SPEAKER_33]: We have two unit three unit multiplex.

209
00:20:35,285 --> 00:20:42,409
[SPEAKER_33]: This is from 4 to 6 units, townhouse and historic conversion, and we would allow local 80 you

210
00:20:43,551 --> 00:20:47,234
[SPEAKER_33]: only for one, two, and three units.

211
00:20:47,435 --> 00:21:03,668
[SPEAKER_33]: So in this district, if there is any single existing, if there is any two or three units, then you could have another unit as ADU, and that is your local ADU, and a second by special permit only.

212
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:04,449
[SPEAKER_33]: And in UR1,

213
00:21:06,586 --> 00:21:13,029
[SPEAKER_33]: the the principal buildings that are allowed is three unit multiplex townhouse and historic conversion.

214
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:31,178
[SPEAKER_33]: And then so any one, two and three, so one that is already existing, two unit that is already existing, and then any existing or new three unit will be allowed a local ADU and the other will be by special permit.

215
00:21:31,858 --> 00:21:37,923
[SPEAKER_33]: I know it's a little bit confusing, but we have the table so you can look at it with a little bit more attention.

216
00:21:40,806 --> 00:21:42,767
[SPEAKER_33]: So this is for the ADUs.

217
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:48,032
[SPEAKER_33]: I know that if it's the first time that you're hearing about this, you might have many questions.

218
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,394
[SPEAKER_33]: So you can always ask.

219
00:21:52,891 --> 00:21:56,112
[SPEAKER_33]: whatever you need to know, we are here to answer that.

220
00:21:57,732 --> 00:22:00,053
[SPEAKER_33]: So lot requirements, this is a new information.

221
00:22:00,093 --> 00:22:03,554
[SPEAKER_33]: We haven't shown this information before.

222
00:22:04,594 --> 00:22:16,377
[SPEAKER_33]: We have talked about the content, but because we've seen that it's a little bit difficult to understand in a more text way, we have created a lot of visuals.

223
00:22:16,797 --> 00:22:18,118
[SPEAKER_33]: So to see if it's,

224
00:22:19,118 --> 00:22:20,678
[SPEAKER_33]: a little bit easier to understand.

225
00:22:20,698 --> 00:22:36,482
[SPEAKER_33]: Um, so what we want to, um, to show is what requirements are there that we need to apply to every lot, and it help us shape, um, the end result.

226
00:22:37,183 --> 00:22:37,543
[SPEAKER_33]: And so

227
00:22:39,003 --> 00:22:44,644
[SPEAKER_33]: First of all, we have your normal lot facing the main street.

228
00:22:45,765 --> 00:22:51,426
[SPEAKER_33]: And so the first thing that we will look into it is what are the conditions of that lot?

229
00:22:51,866 --> 00:22:54,187
[SPEAKER_33]: So what is the minute the lot area?

230
00:22:54,227 --> 00:22:58,128
[SPEAKER_33]: So, for example, this lot area is 4000 square foot.

231
00:23:00,308 --> 00:23:07,331
[SPEAKER_33]: our requirement for many of this residential district is a minimum lot area of 4,000 square foot.

232
00:23:07,671 --> 00:23:10,932
[SPEAKER_33]: So that requirement we can take because it's 4,000.

233
00:23:11,892 --> 00:23:20,676
[SPEAKER_33]: The next one will be the frontage that is the line between our front, the front of our lot and the street, the main street.

234
00:23:20,716 --> 00:23:26,058
[SPEAKER_33]: So that line is called the frontage and the requirement is that it needs to be bigger than 35.

235
00:23:27,918 --> 00:23:31,240
[SPEAKER_33]: This lot is 40, so then we can take that.

236
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,120
[SPEAKER_33]: Yes, check.

237
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,721
[SPEAKER_33]: We do have this requirement.

238
00:23:35,062 --> 00:23:36,602
[SPEAKER_33]: The next one will be the setbacks.

239
00:23:36,762 --> 00:23:47,207
[SPEAKER_33]: So this is not really what is there, something that you cannot change as your lot, but something that you can introduce unless it's existing.

240
00:23:47,347 --> 00:23:52,510
[SPEAKER_33]: But if it's a new building, then you would have to follow the setback requirements.

241
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:58,736
[SPEAKER_33]: You have a front yard of 10 side yards of five and rear yard of 10, for example.

242
00:23:59,817 --> 00:24:03,500
[SPEAKER_33]: If you have that, then we can check as well that requirement.

243
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,485
[SPEAKER_33]: And that means that within that area is where you can place your principal building.

244
00:24:10,962 --> 00:24:12,664
[SPEAKER_33]: Then we also have a building coverage.

245
00:24:13,165 --> 00:24:18,950
[SPEAKER_33]: The requirement will be 40%, so we cannot go over that requirement of that 40%.

246
00:24:21,372 --> 00:24:25,496
[SPEAKER_33]: And then we also have, we introduced the permeable surface.

247
00:24:25,697 --> 00:24:27,859
[SPEAKER_33]: We have a minimum permeable surface of 30%.

248
00:24:30,977 --> 00:24:33,819
[SPEAKER_33]: And then we have the requirement of open landscape.

249
00:24:34,019 --> 00:24:39,462
[SPEAKER_33]: And so the 20% of the land has to be green, has to be vegetation only.

250
00:24:40,443 --> 00:24:44,945
[SPEAKER_33]: And finally, the last requirement would be the off-street parking.

251
00:24:45,686 --> 00:24:48,488
[SPEAKER_33]: So there are minimum off-street parking requirements.

252
00:24:48,608 --> 00:24:49,989
[SPEAKER_33]: We would need to adhere to those.

253
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:56,052
[SPEAKER_33]: There are many different requirements, but let's say single families, too.

254
00:24:57,753 --> 00:24:58,273
[SPEAKER_33]: it's allowed.

255
00:24:58,613 --> 00:25:00,234
[SPEAKER_33]: The residential typologies are 1.5.

256
00:25:01,114 --> 00:25:01,955
[SPEAKER_33]: Let's stay with that.

257
00:25:02,155 --> 00:25:06,536
[SPEAKER_33]: This has to so it checks as well this requirement.

258
00:25:07,056 --> 00:25:15,119
[SPEAKER_33]: So when we look into number of units and the lot size, and this is usually the question that we get is in a 4000.

259
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:17,620
[SPEAKER_33]: It's allowed six units.

260
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:18,940
[SPEAKER_33]: How that can be possible.

261
00:25:24,822 --> 00:25:25,062
[SPEAKER_33]: requirements.

262
00:25:25,082 --> 00:25:31,305
[SPEAKER_33]: And then when you follow all the requirements you can have just as a certain number of units.

263
00:25:31,665 --> 00:25:34,267
[SPEAKER_33]: So that's something that we wanted to show.

264
00:25:35,547 --> 00:25:37,268
[SPEAKER_33]: We also want to show the current zoning.

265
00:25:37,728 --> 00:25:40,850
[SPEAKER_33]: Um and what are the lot requirements in your current zoning?

266
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:46,132
[SPEAKER_33]: You do have these three single family duplex and the next one is multi family and

267
00:25:54,256 --> 00:25:58,385
[SPEAKER_33]: Um, so for single family, you have 7,005,000 duplex.

268
00:25:58,545 --> 00:26:02,152
[SPEAKER_33]: We have minimum of 6,000 square foot large and multifamily.

269
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:03,495
[SPEAKER_33]: Your minimum is 10,000 square foot.

270
00:26:06,436 --> 00:26:10,299
[SPEAKER_33]: So if we go to one unit dwelling, this is how it would look like.

271
00:26:10,379 --> 00:26:13,302
[SPEAKER_33]: Your lot area is 5,000, frontage 35.

272
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:14,923
[SPEAKER_33]: You have a lot width.

273
00:26:15,703 --> 00:26:18,385
[SPEAKER_33]: That's something that in the new requirements that is taken out.

274
00:26:18,906 --> 00:26:20,087
[SPEAKER_33]: Your lot width is 50.

275
00:26:20,567 --> 00:26:24,730
[SPEAKER_33]: Setbacks are 15, side 7 1⁄2, rear 15.

276
00:26:25,871 --> 00:26:26,992
[SPEAKER_33]: Building coverage is the same.

277
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:28,053
[SPEAKER_33]: We are not changing that.

278
00:26:28,093 --> 00:26:28,193
[SPEAKER_33]: It's 40.

279
00:26:29,053 --> 00:26:33,857
[SPEAKER_33]: You do not have permeable surface, and you do not have an open landscape.

280
00:26:33,957 --> 00:26:34,858
[SPEAKER_33]: It's not applicable.

281
00:26:35,498 --> 00:26:37,519
[SPEAKER_33]: for the one unit dwelling.

282
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:48,226
[SPEAKER_33]: Now also, the definition in your open landscape accepts all the things that it's not vegetation, it accepts sidewalks or terraces.

283
00:26:49,006 --> 00:26:58,472
[SPEAKER_33]: So you do not have any impervious surface limit or pervious surface requirement, and you do not have also green requirement.

284
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,721
[SPEAKER_33]: for the duplex is very similar to the other one.

285
00:27:03,881 --> 00:27:06,342
[SPEAKER_33]: It's just the lot areas are a little bit bigger.

286
00:27:06,362 --> 00:27:09,303
[SPEAKER_33]: 6,000 frontage, 35 lot with 60.

287
00:27:10,624 --> 00:27:11,684
[SPEAKER_33]: The setbacks are the same.

288
00:27:11,764 --> 00:27:13,985
[SPEAKER_33]: Building coverage is a little bit less, 35.

289
00:27:14,485 --> 00:27:16,646
[SPEAKER_33]: Open landscape, again, does not apply.

290
00:27:16,826 --> 00:27:18,867
[SPEAKER_33]: You can have all this as impervious surface.

291
00:27:19,227 --> 00:27:20,728
[SPEAKER_33]: That is okay.

292
00:27:20,868 --> 00:27:22,168
[SPEAKER_33]: Office street parking is 1.5.

293
00:27:24,249 --> 00:27:37,259
[SPEAKER_33]: Um and then for the multifamily lot area is passed from 6,000 to 10,000 frontage 50 lot with 100 and setbacks are 15.

294
00:27:37,399 --> 00:27:43,603
[SPEAKER_33]: All of them building coverage 35 and the open landscape requirement again doesn't

295
00:27:49,007 --> 00:27:55,933
[SPEAKER_33]: So this is your existing requirements in your current zoning.

296
00:27:57,314 --> 00:28:07,402
[SPEAKER_33]: So just putting one next to the other, on the left you see the current ones, and on the right the new requirements for each of them.

297
00:28:08,903 --> 00:28:12,807
[SPEAKER_33]: So the requirements for lot area for NR1, 2, 3, and 4

298
00:28:14,808 --> 00:28:17,349
[SPEAKER_33]: and you are to are all 4,000.

299
00:28:18,429 --> 00:28:35,853
[SPEAKER_33]: Again, this is for making sure that we add flexibility, making sure that all your non-conforming enter in this are now conforming, and that we have so many other requirements that will tell us how many units can be in 4,000.

300
00:28:37,834 --> 00:28:41,296
[SPEAKER_33]: frontage, 35 and 35 for NR1 and 2.

301
00:28:41,716 --> 00:28:45,759
[SPEAKER_33]: And for NR3, UR1 and UR2 is 40.

302
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,381
[SPEAKER_33]: We do not have the lot width.

303
00:28:49,162 --> 00:28:54,646
[SPEAKER_33]: We have facade build out only for NR3, UR1 and UR2.

304
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:59,430
[SPEAKER_33]: And this is to make sure that the facade, there is some width.

305
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:00,310
[SPEAKER_33]: Um.

306
00:29:01,791 --> 00:29:11,538
[SPEAKER_33]: So the front the main facade that is, uh, abutting the front street, um, that has a minimum of.

307
00:29:17,543 --> 00:29:21,325
[SPEAKER_33]: The heights are similar to what it was before, 2.5 for NR1 and 2.

308
00:29:21,365 --> 00:29:22,906
[SPEAKER_33]: And for NR3, your 1 and your 2 is 3.

309
00:29:22,946 --> 00:29:25,568
[SPEAKER_33]: We will have some suggestions and recommendations for your 2.

310
00:29:32,513 --> 00:29:40,859
[SPEAKER_33]: setbacks, and our 1, 2, and 3, and your 1 are front setback 10, side setback 5, rear setback 10.

311
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:47,724
[SPEAKER_33]: And then for your 2, the front setback is 5, side 5, and rear 10.

312
00:29:48,405 --> 00:29:53,528
[SPEAKER_33]: Building coverage is all of them, except for your 2, all of them are 40.

313
00:29:53,929 --> 00:29:55,470
[SPEAKER_33]: Your 2 is 50%.

314
00:29:57,291 --> 00:29:59,733
[SPEAKER_33]: Purview surface, so this is something we add.

315
00:30:00,473 --> 00:30:06,297
[SPEAKER_33]: Um all of them are 30% except for your two is 25 landscape.

316
00:30:06,757 --> 00:30:15,902
[SPEAKER_33]: Um so only and we, um, adapt new definition so that open scape landscape is only vegetation.

317
00:30:16,583 --> 00:30:18,704
[SPEAKER_33]: And so it's.

318
00:30:19,224 --> 00:30:21,826
[SPEAKER_33]: 20% for all of them, except for your one that is

319
00:30:28,983 --> 00:30:46,071
[SPEAKER_25]: I just like to add very quickly because I think we get a lot of questions as to where the numbers came from so last year about this time we had a meeting with the planning and permitting committee, obviously open as all of those were to the public, and we showed breakdowns of non conforming parcels throughout the city.

320
00:30:46,572 --> 00:30:51,294
[SPEAKER_25]: And so a lot of the recommendations come from those studies of non conformities.

321
00:30:51,774 --> 00:31:04,964
[SPEAKER_25]: All of those maps are static maps and they are on the town zoning website could have probably buried back in the history but they are all available for people to review and that analysis is what led to those recommendations.

322
00:31:05,909 --> 00:31:11,812
[SPEAKER_42]: And just to confirm, when you did that analysis, it was to align or to remove the nonconformities.

323
00:31:12,132 --> 00:31:16,734
[SPEAKER_42]: So to align what we're proposing and zoning with our current conditions?

324
00:31:17,414 --> 00:31:18,555
[SPEAKER_25]: As much as possible.

325
00:31:18,635 --> 00:31:28,520
[SPEAKER_25]: So the actual 4,000 square foot lot size, you actually have quite a few lots that are still in the 3,500 up range.

326
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:35,283
[SPEAKER_25]: So we couldn't address all of the nonconformities, but we did try to reduce as many as possible.

327
00:31:36,224 --> 00:31:36,304
[SPEAKER_42]: you.

328
00:31:36,324 --> 00:31:37,025
[SPEAKER_42]: Great Thank you for that.

329
00:31:38,826 --> 00:31:56,462
[SPEAKER_33]: Um so in this map, what we wanted to show and we are going to show this in the in in in other in the following slides as well with different lot areas, and I'm sorry that in the table because of the subtitles, it's covering half of the map.

330
00:31:56,482 --> 00:31:57,844
[SPEAKER_33]: So I'm sorry, but you will have

331
00:32:03,048 --> 00:32:09,571
[SPEAKER_33]: Um so we wanted to, uh, address what are the sizes the real sizes of your lots in Medford?

332
00:32:10,331 --> 00:32:16,353
[SPEAKER_33]: And so we start with this size between Lot area size between 3500 and 5000.

333
00:32:16,454 --> 00:32:18,754
[SPEAKER_33]: And so what do you get?

334
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:24,297
[SPEAKER_33]: What we can see is that a lot of the Medford met for South Medford area.

335
00:32:25,417 --> 00:32:26,858
[SPEAKER_33]: Um, I would say 80% 70% of the

336
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:40,327
[SPEAKER_33]: When we go to the Lawrence State, for example, the big majority are bigger than this 5,000.

337
00:32:40,868 --> 00:32:50,977
[SPEAKER_33]: Usually it's because of the time, what is more historic, what has been densified during the historic times, et cetera.

338
00:32:51,898 --> 00:32:57,483
[SPEAKER_33]: So usually newer neighborhoods have bigger lot sizes.

339
00:32:59,243 --> 00:33:06,531
[SPEAKER_33]: Um so in the proposed zoning because we heard a lot of what can you fit in the 4000 square foot lots?

340
00:33:07,292 --> 00:33:13,158
[SPEAKER_33]: We wanted to make some tests and try with that 40 by 100.

341
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:21,486
[SPEAKER_33]: Um what can actually fit in there, taking into account all the record all the requirements that we just mentioned.

342
00:33:22,427 --> 00:33:28,088
[SPEAKER_33]: And so what we have done here is mentioning the requirements that are there.

343
00:33:29,428 --> 00:33:33,949
[SPEAKER_33]: And then what building types can be done.

344
00:33:34,029 --> 00:33:41,251
[SPEAKER_33]: So here, for example, we have the first is a single family, a single family in a 4,000 lot with two parking.

345
00:33:42,231 --> 00:33:43,971
[SPEAKER_33]: And we go to the surface.

346
00:33:44,051 --> 00:33:51,433
[SPEAKER_33]: We see that in the round, in the circle that is in the corner, we have

347
00:33:53,014 --> 00:33:55,336
[SPEAKER_33]: the pie chart.

348
00:33:55,356 --> 00:34:00,520
[SPEAKER_33]: 21% of building covered, so we are way below that 40% requirement, so we are good.

349
00:34:01,021 --> 00:34:09,728
[SPEAKER_33]: Permable is 44%, so it's below more than that 30% minimum requirement, so we are good.

350
00:34:10,489 --> 00:34:12,490
[SPEAKER_33]: And then the rest is driveway and parking.

351
00:34:13,772 --> 00:34:16,794
[SPEAKER_33]: What districts allow this typology is NR1, NR2, and NR3?

352
00:34:19,296 --> 00:34:23,338
[SPEAKER_33]: And then we also have the square footage per unit.

353
00:34:23,838 --> 00:34:32,261
[SPEAKER_33]: In this case, the house, the single family house would be 2,550 square foot.

354
00:34:33,682 --> 00:34:35,823
[SPEAKER_33]: So if we continue, what happened?

355
00:34:35,863 --> 00:34:37,403
[SPEAKER_33]: We have a two unit.

356
00:34:37,583 --> 00:34:38,344
[SPEAKER_33]: Does it fit?

357
00:34:38,924 --> 00:34:40,364
[SPEAKER_33]: And so what are the requirements?

358
00:34:40,484 --> 00:34:43,426
[SPEAKER_33]: Again, we have that pie chart again.

359
00:34:43,486 --> 00:34:44,626
[SPEAKER_33]: So we have building coverage.

360
00:34:44,646 --> 00:34:45,726
[SPEAKER_33]: 21 is the same as the other one.

361
00:34:47,768 --> 00:34:52,472
[SPEAKER_33]: we're still good with the permability requirement.

362
00:34:53,213 --> 00:34:56,916
[SPEAKER_33]: Um and then the units we would have won the ground floor.

363
00:34:57,356 --> 00:35:01,880
[SPEAKER_33]: That is 85 850 and then the upper two floors or that one and a half would be 1700.

364
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,582
[SPEAKER_33]: What districts would allow this

365
00:35:15,717 --> 00:35:17,238
[SPEAKER_33]: What happened if we add another unit?

366
00:35:17,318 --> 00:35:22,881
[SPEAKER_33]: So now we have a three units and every of this units is 80 150 square foot.

367
00:35:24,162 --> 00:35:32,746
[SPEAKER_33]: Well, when we add all the parking requirement that we have, and this is the 1.5 off street parking, then we see that the permeable is 29%.

368
00:35:32,786 --> 00:35:34,327
[SPEAKER_33]: So we are below that requirement of 30%.

369
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:44,813
[SPEAKER_33]: and so in that case, this wouldn't be possible unless we do something.

370
00:35:45,394 --> 00:35:57,502
[SPEAKER_33]: And so if we change that parking using permeable paving, then we would be in 49% of permeable and open landscape 29.

371
00:35:57,842 --> 00:36:02,185
[SPEAKER_33]: So we are also above that requirement of green being 20%.

372
00:36:03,186 --> 00:36:07,128
[SPEAKER_33]: And so in that case, we could have a three unit in a 4,000 square foot lot.

373
00:36:08,489 --> 00:36:14,073
[SPEAKER_33]: that we are within that half a mile of a transit high frequency transit, and so that we only need 0.8 off street

374
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:41,231
[SPEAKER_33]: different ways that this would work.

375
00:36:42,011 --> 00:36:44,472
[SPEAKER_33]: Four units, it's not possible.

376
00:36:45,172 --> 00:36:58,495
[SPEAKER_33]: So this would be that maximum, unless there are other things, unless, again, the requirements of parking is because of high transit or the units are smaller.

377
00:36:59,936 --> 00:37:04,217
[SPEAKER_33]: Otherwise, it is to start to get very difficult to fit more than three units.

378
00:37:06,078 --> 00:37:12,302
[SPEAKER_33]: examples that you have in Medford of single family buildings in lots that are 4000 square foot or less.

379
00:37:12,743 --> 00:37:13,663
[SPEAKER_33]: These are three of them.

380
00:37:13,683 --> 00:37:15,244
[SPEAKER_33]: You have quite a lot.

381
00:37:15,405 --> 00:37:21,108
[SPEAKER_33]: Medford has the lots in Medford, as we as we saw before, are quite small.

382
00:37:21,289 --> 00:37:33,177
[SPEAKER_33]: So within that 4000 5000, we have quite a lot duplex lots that are in 4000 or less, and then three units that are in 4000 square foot or less.

383
00:37:35,038 --> 00:37:37,339
[SPEAKER_33]: These are Medford areas.

384
00:37:38,779 --> 00:37:53,164
[SPEAKER_33]: So we wanted to show, and this map has been using the filter function that we have on the interactive map, where you can also set the range for the lot sizes of the area.

385
00:37:53,304 --> 00:37:56,265
[SPEAKER_33]: So you can also filter and see it by yourself.

386
00:37:57,586 --> 00:38:00,947
[SPEAKER_33]: If anyone wants to know how we do that, we are here.

387
00:38:01,347 --> 00:38:02,208
[SPEAKER_33]: We can show it.

388
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,050
[SPEAKER_33]: the meeting.

389
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:07,352
[SPEAKER_33]: Um so this will be 5,006,007,006,007,007,008,000

390
00:38:19,344 --> 00:38:19,544
[SPEAKER_33]: Um.

391
00:38:20,724 --> 00:38:25,065
[SPEAKER_33]: We also got the question about what happened with the division when we get into 8000.

392
00:38:25,385 --> 00:38:37,028
[SPEAKER_33]: That means two times 4000 so you could subdivide a lot of these lots for 8000 are very difficult shapes or very, very narrow.

393
00:38:37,528 --> 00:38:41,408
[SPEAKER_33]: And so when we also we have another requirement, the frontage

394
00:38:51,137 --> 00:39:00,203
[SPEAKER_33]: And also I want to point that these subdivisions are mainly possible in certain areas, like you can see South Medford.

395
00:39:00,743 --> 00:39:03,485
[SPEAKER_33]: These are very, very few lots that you could do this.

396
00:39:06,862 --> 00:39:07,503
[SPEAKER_33]: building type.

397
00:39:07,583 --> 00:39:11,246
[SPEAKER_33]: So first we saw what do we what can we fit in a 4000?

398
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:16,851
[SPEAKER_33]: Now we say what type of lot sizes we need.

399
00:39:17,031 --> 00:39:20,234
[SPEAKER_33]: What lot sizes we need to fit other typologies.

400
00:39:20,874 --> 00:39:22,976
[SPEAKER_33]: And so what do we need for two dwelling?

401
00:39:23,316 --> 00:39:29,381
[SPEAKER_33]: But that is side by side for three townhouse, for example, and for a multiplex of four units.

402
00:39:29,521 --> 00:39:32,724
[SPEAKER_33]: What are the sizes that we need with the requirements that we have?

403
00:39:34,326 --> 00:39:36,328
[SPEAKER_33]: And so you're going to see them in here.

404
00:39:37,449 --> 00:39:41,133
[SPEAKER_33]: The lot size that we have for this example would be 4,800.

405
00:39:41,313 --> 00:39:45,337
[SPEAKER_33]: And the two units, each of these units are at 1,200 square foot.

406
00:39:52,084 --> 00:39:57,190
[SPEAKER_33]: The next one for the townhouse would be for three townhouses is 8800.

407
00:39:58,211 --> 00:40:02,797
[SPEAKER_33]: Each of this building, each of these units are 1600 square foot.

408
00:40:07,121 --> 00:40:18,027
[SPEAKER_33]: and then if we go to a four unit, we would have 6600 square foot lots, and these are 920 square foot per unit.

409
00:40:19,448 --> 00:40:24,931
[SPEAKER_33]: Just this can change depending on the parking requirement.

410
00:40:25,451 --> 00:40:30,834
[SPEAKER_33]: Again, if you're in a high transit, that will reduce, and so you could have it less.

411
00:40:31,655 --> 00:40:35,657
[SPEAKER_33]: The building type, so if it's a smaller unit,

412
00:40:36,397 --> 00:40:38,758
[SPEAKER_33]: that would also decrease the square footage.

413
00:40:38,958 --> 00:40:41,119
[SPEAKER_33]: So there are things to still keep in mind.

414
00:40:42,659 --> 00:40:44,700
[SPEAKER_33]: But it was just to have a better idea.

415
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:50,182
[SPEAKER_33]: These are duplex, for example, in 5,000 square foot in Medford.

416
00:40:51,002 --> 00:40:53,122
[SPEAKER_33]: Some townhouses, you do not have a lot.

417
00:40:54,143 --> 00:40:56,924
[SPEAKER_33]: So there are just a few examples.

418
00:40:58,584 --> 00:41:00,025
[SPEAKER_33]: And they're multiplex.

419
00:41:01,565 --> 00:41:03,886
[SPEAKER_33]: You have a four, these are two four units.

420
00:41:04,927 --> 00:41:10,552
[SPEAKER_33]: The one on the left were somewhere around 7,000, I think, not even.

421
00:41:11,873 --> 00:41:13,214
[SPEAKER_33]: Very good example, by the way.

422
00:41:13,814 --> 00:41:16,417
[SPEAKER_33]: And then this is a six unit multiplex.

423
00:41:16,757 --> 00:41:17,818
[SPEAKER_33]: And this was also around 7,000.

424
00:41:21,401 --> 00:41:21,881
[SPEAKER_33]: Yes.

425
00:41:23,502 --> 00:41:36,751
[SPEAKER_25]: And I do just want to reiterate for the board that these aren't saying that these houses would absolutely happen this way, but the idea what we heard where people were wanting to understand kind of what was the maximum build on the minimum lot size.

426
00:41:36,831 --> 00:41:48,599
[SPEAKER_25]: So these are just examples of where the dimensional restrictions start to restrict what you can actually put on the lot so that you can only get up to three units on a 4,000 square foot lot.

427
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,383
[SPEAKER_25]: If you actually do the permeable surfaces.

428
00:41:52,724 --> 00:42:03,580
[SPEAKER_25]: If you want to do some of those other building types the side by side rather than the stacked, you actually need larger lots just to be able to do those so that was the information we wanted to make sure that we conveyed.

429
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:07,671
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah, thank you for that.

430
00:42:07,751 --> 00:42:14,720
[SPEAKER_42]: And I do recall the request to have pictures of actual properties in Medford that fit some of these descriptions.

431
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:22,330
[SPEAKER_42]: I think this is very helpful for me and hopefully for everybody else to contextualize some of the information that you're sharing.

432
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:23,211
[SPEAKER_42]: So thank you for that.

433
00:42:25,579 --> 00:42:32,484
[SPEAKER_33]: And then we have the part of private ways that we wanted to explain sometimes with the visuals.

434
00:42:33,024 --> 00:42:34,365
[SPEAKER_33]: It's easier to understand.

435
00:42:35,066 --> 00:42:51,357
[SPEAKER_33]: So we have said that for the distribution of the new boundaries for the districts, we wanted to have in mind several criteria, one of them being, for example, near high transit, near service,

436
00:42:52,097 --> 00:42:55,538
[SPEAKER_33]: Um, jobs, uh, production, um.

437
00:42:57,999 --> 00:42:59,439
[SPEAKER_33]: Lot sizes, topography.

438
00:42:59,979 --> 00:43:03,580
[SPEAKER_33]: One of them was private ways versus public ways.

439
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:10,421
[SPEAKER_33]: So this information we already, um, we didn't presented it, but we delivered this.

440
00:43:10,481 --> 00:43:14,622
[SPEAKER_33]: So I'm going to go also a little bit fast because we want to hear from all of you.

441
00:43:15,523 --> 00:43:15,603
[SPEAKER_33]: Um.

442
00:43:16,903 --> 00:43:29,851
[SPEAKER_33]: So there are certain requirements for streets in order to be, in these cases, in your rules and regulations of the Medford Planning Board governing the subdivision of land.

443
00:43:30,291 --> 00:43:44,179
[SPEAKER_33]: And so you have these two types of class A and class B. Mainly what I want to say here is that at least you need for class A, it has to be a 60-foot right of way, and a class B is 50 right of way.

444
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:49,622
[SPEAKER_33]: If we look at Medford, you almost don't have any of those roads.

445
00:43:50,062 --> 00:43:55,124
[SPEAKER_33]: And these are the ones that you see in this map are main roads, right?

446
00:43:55,164 --> 00:43:58,066
[SPEAKER_33]: Like you have Mystic, Main.

447
00:43:58,406 --> 00:44:09,811
[SPEAKER_33]: So you have a lot of the corridors and so the connectors, right, from place A to B. These are usually those wider than 15.

448
00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:18,162
[SPEAKER_33]: And so some of that, sorry, I'm going to go back.

449
00:44:18,722 --> 00:44:27,268
[SPEAKER_33]: Some of this we have, the public roads are in blue in this map, and then the orange roads are the private ways.

450
00:44:28,089 --> 00:44:30,731
[SPEAKER_33]: And so you do have some of the private ways.

451
00:44:30,971 --> 00:44:34,213
[SPEAKER_42]: So real quick, just to clarify, the legend on this is incorrect?

452
00:44:34,514 --> 00:44:34,754
[SPEAKER_33]: Yes.

453
00:44:34,834 --> 00:44:36,095
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay, what does the gray mean?

454
00:44:36,335 --> 00:44:37,376
[SPEAKER_42]: Like state roads?

455
00:44:38,216 --> 00:44:38,437
[SPEAKER_33]: Yes.

456
00:44:38,457 --> 00:44:39,057
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay, great.

457
00:44:39,277 --> 00:44:39,657
[SPEAKER_33]: That is correct.

458
00:44:41,339 --> 00:44:42,579
[SPEAKER_33]: I just saw that.

459
00:44:42,619 --> 00:44:43,860
[SPEAKER_33]: So thank you for that.

460
00:44:45,061 --> 00:44:47,062
[SPEAKER_33]: So the public roads are the blue ones.

461
00:44:47,442 --> 00:44:49,363
[SPEAKER_33]: The private roads are the orange.

462
00:44:49,503 --> 00:44:50,083
[SPEAKER_33]: This is wrong.

463
00:44:50,464 --> 00:44:56,327
[SPEAKER_33]: And then we have these estate mass DOT ownership roads.

464
00:44:58,175 --> 00:44:59,216
[SPEAKER_33]: that are the gray ones.

465
00:44:59,776 --> 00:45:02,377
[SPEAKER_33]: So these are the ones that are in that wider than 50.

466
00:45:04,938 --> 00:45:08,939
[SPEAKER_33]: And so we do have some private roads in here, as you can see.

467
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:14,181
[SPEAKER_33]: And then we have those examples with some pictures.

468
00:45:14,241 --> 00:45:17,382
[SPEAKER_33]: For example, this is Essex Street.

469
00:45:20,103 --> 00:45:26,085
[SPEAKER_33]: We have a lot of information, but I'm just going to go to the images so that we see what are the conditions of these streets.

470
00:45:26,465 --> 00:45:28,986
[SPEAKER_33]: There's another private road, Whitney, with those 50.

471
00:45:30,906 --> 00:45:40,469
[SPEAKER_33]: And then we go into the big majority of the Medford roads, public and private, that are between that 40 and 50, equal 40 and less than 40.

472
00:45:44,290 --> 00:46:03,200
[SPEAKER_33]: And so within the National Association of City Transportation Officials, this is the NACTO, they have certain recommendations, and we have used those to also bring into what should have a public road.

473
00:46:03,841 --> 00:46:05,462
[SPEAKER_33]: What are those neighborhood streets?

474
00:46:06,162 --> 00:46:09,366
[SPEAKER_33]: Um, obviously a lot of this is outside of zoning.

475
00:46:09,506 --> 00:46:13,030
[SPEAKER_33]: We only attend, um, the private property.

476
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:22,061
[SPEAKER_33]: So this is a lot of this is public, so we don't want to go there a lot, but just want to show, um, what are the conditions of certain of this private roads?

477
00:46:23,703 --> 00:46:34,672
[SPEAKER_33]: So then when we go to the 40 more than 40 less than 50 with that we have an example of what it should be like or what it should look like.

478
00:46:35,393 --> 00:46:36,634
[SPEAKER_33]: What should be the sizes.

479
00:46:38,175 --> 00:46:42,379
[SPEAKER_33]: And then we have the map showing what are those streets that are within

480
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:44,881
[SPEAKER_33]: 40 and 50.

481
00:46:45,321 --> 00:46:53,865
[SPEAKER_33]: And as we can see here, a lot of the public roads are also 40 and 50, are not in those standards or 50 and 60 are actually here.

482
00:46:55,426 --> 00:46:58,047
[SPEAKER_33]: Again, public roads, sorry, the orange.

483
00:46:59,408 --> 00:47:01,929
[SPEAKER_33]: And so what are those examples between a 40 and a 50?

484
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:06,232
[SPEAKER_33]: We will see here in Blakely Road, Exeter Street,

485
00:47:07,892 --> 00:47:15,315
[SPEAKER_33]: And then for equal to 40, again, we see a little bit that smaller scale.

486
00:47:16,415 --> 00:47:20,536
[SPEAKER_33]: And we go to Badger Road, Wheeler Road.

487
00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:21,697
[SPEAKER_33]: These are all private.

488
00:47:21,757 --> 00:47:25,078
[SPEAKER_33]: The ones that we show on images are all private roads, private ways.

489
00:47:26,563 --> 00:47:30,685
[SPEAKER_33]: Hickory Avenue, and then one is less than 40.

490
00:47:32,465 --> 00:47:38,047
[SPEAKER_33]: We see already now that a lot of those are private and a lot less are public.

491
00:47:39,268 --> 00:47:46,271
[SPEAKER_33]: And so we have Whitman Road, Dover Street, Chandler Road, Rural Avenue.

492
00:47:46,291 --> 00:47:48,912
[SPEAKER_33]: The bigger majority are in this one.

493
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:53,533
[SPEAKER_33]: Winthrop, sorry, Winthrop Place, Winthrop,

494
00:47:55,194 --> 00:47:56,636
[SPEAKER_33]: Sorry, court court.

495
00:47:58,178 --> 00:48:06,186
[SPEAKER_33]: Then we have another like usually North Medford because of topography has really.

496
00:48:09,735 --> 00:48:13,178
[SPEAKER_33]: The situation is not the best, let's say, like that.

497
00:48:13,578 --> 00:48:21,205
[SPEAKER_33]: So Landry Road, Bailey Street, Taft Street, the topography is also very amazing.

498
00:48:21,906 --> 00:48:27,571
[SPEAKER_33]: Raymond Street, Granite Road, Hillsborough Road, yeah.

499
00:48:30,536 --> 00:48:47,462
[SPEAKER_25]: And I'll just jump in to say that the reason for showing this, Paula spoke to it earlier, but just to confirm, we heard a lot of questions about why we were recommending certain districts for some areas and not for others, question from people of why there was density higher in one place and not others.

500
00:48:47,902 --> 00:48:54,304
[SPEAKER_25]: This idea of topography and public versus private was something that we'd talked about in the past, but hadn't shown people.

501
00:48:54,484 --> 00:48:57,125
[SPEAKER_25]: So with that, I think we're onto our last section.

502
00:49:00,017 --> 00:49:01,358
[SPEAKER_32]: Can I interrupt for one thing?

503
00:49:01,758 --> 00:49:09,161
[SPEAKER_32]: Could you send me the slides so I can share them through the Google Drive for people on their own computers to see a little more easily?

504
00:49:09,181 --> 00:49:13,403
[SPEAKER_32]: And I just want to share that member Adam Behrens has joined.

505
00:49:13,463 --> 00:49:16,405
[SPEAKER_32]: He apologizes for being late, but he's now on Zoom for the record.

506
00:49:17,269 --> 00:49:18,470
[SPEAKER_25]: And thank you, Director Hunt.

507
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:22,393
[SPEAKER_25]: Actually, this is one of the largest slide decks we've ever done.

508
00:49:22,753 --> 00:49:30,580
[SPEAKER_25]: So we need to split it into three sets so that people will be able to download it on slower internet speeds.

509
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:33,322
[SPEAKER_25]: We will do that, and we will get it to you as soon as possible.

510
00:49:35,964 --> 00:49:36,384
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you.

511
00:49:36,404 --> 00:49:43,089
[SPEAKER_50]: A lot of what you're talking about

512
00:49:44,347 --> 00:49:51,610
[SPEAKER_50]: These people have heard about a lot of could you could you could you switch it on?

513
00:49:56,712 --> 00:49:58,773
[SPEAKER_50]: I would like to make a point that we.

514
00:50:00,075 --> 00:50:01,196
[SPEAKER_50]: I would like to make a point.

515
00:50:01,517 --> 00:50:04,901
[SPEAKER_55]: We've got 60 or 70 people here and 250 people online.

516
00:50:05,341 --> 00:50:12,409
[SPEAKER_55]: And I don't think we want to go through the thousand combinations on the zoning code that we already read and get some people up here to speak.

517
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:15,613
[SPEAKER_42]: I appreciate that feedback.

518
00:50:16,054 --> 00:50:18,977
[SPEAKER_42]: And it sounds like you're not alone.

519
00:50:20,118 --> 00:50:26,341
[SPEAKER_42]: But just to clarify, we're not planning to go any further into the zoning than what we've done now.

520
00:50:26,361 --> 00:50:33,324
[SPEAKER_42]: So if you could just please take your seat, we're going to be moving into board discussion, which may be brief, and then we're going to move into public comment.

521
00:50:33,585 --> 00:50:34,125
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you, sir.

522
00:50:34,325 --> 00:50:35,645
[SPEAKER_42]: Please take your seat.

523
00:50:36,066 --> 00:50:36,906
[SPEAKER_42]: Please take your seat.

524
00:50:37,046 --> 00:50:37,346
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

525
00:50:39,579 --> 00:50:46,281
[SPEAKER_25]: Madam Chair, to that point, these recommendations are ones that you've seen before so we can end our presentation now.

526
00:50:46,761 --> 00:51:01,724
[SPEAKER_25]: And when the board is ready to come back to, to this point then we can bring them up again but that's the end of the information that has not been either haven't been presented, or had not been presented had not been presented but had been given to you.

527
00:51:02,005 --> 00:51:03,645
[SPEAKER_25]: So, you've seen this one before.

528
00:51:12,162 --> 00:51:13,463
[SPEAKER_42]: How long do you think this will take?

529
00:51:14,743 --> 00:51:16,524
[SPEAKER_25]: Another 10 minutes.

530
00:51:16,804 --> 00:51:19,245
[SPEAKER_25]: We are also eager to hear what people have to say.

531
00:51:19,265 --> 00:51:22,146
[SPEAKER_42]: All right, we're gonna keep going with that.

532
00:51:22,166 --> 00:51:22,406
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah.

533
00:51:27,992 --> 00:51:29,494
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay, yeah, we're going to keep going with this.

534
00:51:29,534 --> 00:51:36,764
[SPEAKER_42]: I think this will help offer some clarity to the board as well as the public in terms of changes that we're talking about.

535
00:51:37,545 --> 00:51:45,275
[SPEAKER_42]: If your comments want to address specific changes, this is a really good time to listen or read what's on screen.

536
00:51:49,549 --> 00:52:00,115
[SPEAKER_33]: So the proposed changes from what was presented to the city council, what was referred from the city council, we have some updates in the table of use regulations.

537
00:52:01,496 --> 00:52:05,138
[SPEAKER_33]: We have updates to the table of dimensional requirements.

538
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:15,504
[SPEAKER_33]: We are going to go to the, these were already proposed changes from previous community development boards that you've already seen.

539
00:52:15,624 --> 00:52:17,525
[SPEAKER_33]: So I'm also going to go faster

540
00:52:19,066 --> 00:52:26,551
[SPEAKER_33]: Some another for the table dimensional requirements, adding the green score section.

541
00:52:28,093 --> 00:52:36,658
[SPEAKER_33]: We have some definitions to be defined or adjust about the defining historic conversion.

542
00:52:36,899 --> 00:52:40,081
[SPEAKER_33]: And so in this case, we just added the amount of time.

543
00:52:41,322 --> 00:52:44,144
[SPEAKER_33]: And then we have some historic conversion user standards.

544
00:52:44,784 --> 00:52:46,445
[SPEAKER_33]: And these are the new proposed changes.

545
00:52:46,485 --> 00:52:55,327
[SPEAKER_33]: So what we've seen in the previous community development board, we have come to other changes, and these are the ones that you see in blue.

546
00:52:56,127 --> 00:53:10,772
[SPEAKER_33]: We have in the table of dimensional requirements, some more for the building coverage, and then previous surface and open landscape, adding some small extra definition in the historic conversion.

547
00:53:11,872 --> 00:53:16,154
[SPEAKER_33]: and changing some of the use of standards for the historic conversion.

548
00:53:16,174 --> 00:53:25,998
[SPEAKER_33]: And then the urban residential, too, to have the incentive zoning from three to as incentive zoning one more story.

549
00:53:28,771 --> 00:53:31,813
[SPEAKER_25]: And again, these were in the slide deck for May 21.

550
00:53:32,513 --> 00:53:35,135
[SPEAKER_25]: So we assume that people have been able to see them.

551
00:53:35,835 --> 00:53:47,181
[SPEAKER_25]: I thank everybody for their patience, we know that whenever we do these meetings, there are some people who are joining for the first time, we wanted to make sure that everybody had the same set of information, but thank you all to your patience.

552
00:53:47,581 --> 00:53:51,964
[SPEAKER_25]: We are delighted to listen to comments from the board and to the from the community.

553
00:54:09,048 --> 00:54:10,649
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah, so now I'm going to open it up to the board.

554
00:54:10,669 --> 00:54:13,070
[SPEAKER_42]: This is questions from the board.

555
00:54:13,091 --> 00:54:18,154
[SPEAKER_42]: We're not going to really be deliberating because I think we should deliberate after hearing public comments.

556
00:54:18,894 --> 00:54:20,795
[SPEAKER_42]: So John, yeah, if you have any questions.

557
00:54:21,856 --> 00:54:22,196
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes.

558
00:54:23,797 --> 00:54:28,280
[SPEAKER_49]: The term transit station is a bus stop, a transit station.

559
00:54:30,612 --> 00:54:31,272
[SPEAKER_25]: can you confirm?

560
00:54:32,833 --> 00:54:37,036
[SPEAKER_25]: It is our understanding that a bus stop is not a transit station.

561
00:54:37,136 --> 00:54:44,580
[SPEAKER_25]: It is the point at which the bus embarks from a fixed point and its destination, but it is not the stops in between.

562
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,121
[SPEAKER_25]: That is our current understanding.

563
00:54:46,141 --> 00:54:47,162
[SPEAKER_49]: Thank you.

564
00:54:48,323 --> 00:54:50,644
[SPEAKER_49]: What is meant by facade build out?

565
00:54:50,664 --> 00:54:58,148
[SPEAKER_33]: Um, yeah, so the facade build out is the

566
00:54:59,864 --> 00:55:14,788
[SPEAKER_33]: When you see the frontage line, the frontage is the line that connects the lot with the main street, that intersection, that is the frontage line.

567
00:55:15,968 --> 00:55:22,369
[SPEAKER_33]: And so the build-out facade is the main facade of your building that is looking towards the street.

568
00:55:22,989 --> 00:55:29,071
[SPEAKER_33]: There is at least 60% of that frontage to have that building, that build-up.

569
00:55:30,412 --> 00:55:31,612
[SPEAKER_33]: Is that a little clear?

570
00:55:31,713 --> 00:55:38,277
[SPEAKER_33]: I can also take a diagram that we have that I can look for you and put it up, if that helps.

571
00:55:39,759 --> 00:55:42,941
[SPEAKER_49]: So you're saying it's a percentage of the frontage?

572
00:55:44,062 --> 00:55:44,282
[SPEAKER_49]: Yeah.

573
00:55:44,682 --> 00:55:45,443
[SPEAKER_49]: Okay, thank you.

574
00:55:45,463 --> 00:55:53,229
[SPEAKER_49]: And I'm sure this is kind of complicated, but very briefly, could you say what's involved in the green requirements?

575
00:55:55,485 --> 00:55:59,887
[SPEAKER_33]: The green score, yeah, so we have a menu that they can choose from.

576
00:56:00,027 --> 00:56:03,129
[SPEAKER_33]: It's only the green requirements for the green score.

577
00:56:04,189 --> 00:56:11,012
[SPEAKER_33]: It's only for the UR2 and our only projects that are going through the site plan review, so bigger impact projects.

578
00:56:11,433 --> 00:56:24,079
[SPEAKER_33]: And so you have a menu of choices that you can get from green roofs, green facades, rain gardens that will give you having trees, maintaining existing trees,

579
00:56:24,999 --> 00:56:32,903
[SPEAKER_33]: and gives you some points towards the minimum of those 25 that you need to get.

580
00:56:33,003 --> 00:56:36,165
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm sorry, the city has already passed the green score.

581
00:56:36,205 --> 00:56:42,088
[SPEAKER_25]: It came to the Community Development Board late last year, early this year, and the City Council has passed that one already.

582
00:56:43,649 --> 00:56:52,153
[SPEAKER_49]: Last question, I noticed on a number of the zones there, you talked about going from two and a half to three stories.

583
00:56:54,213 --> 00:57:01,059
[SPEAKER_49]: Excuse me, you talked about the number of stories and they were still at two and a half.

584
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:07,704
[SPEAKER_49]: Are there zones that still have changed from two and a half to three stories height?

585
00:57:10,426 --> 00:57:12,368
[SPEAKER_49]: I'm sorry, maybe I wasn't clear there.

586
00:57:13,097 --> 00:57:20,263
[SPEAKER_33]: So in your current zoning, your single family is 2 1⁄2 maximum, and your duplex is 2 1⁄2.

587
00:57:20,763 --> 00:57:27,829
[SPEAKER_33]: And then multifamily, depending on the intensity that is A or B category, you have three or six.

588
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:40,540
[SPEAKER_33]: So what we are proposing now, also because Medford zoning is the dimensional requirements are by use and not by district, so that is a little bit different.

589
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:44,401
[SPEAKER_33]: And so right now we are proposing by district.

590
00:57:44,421 --> 00:57:47,202
[SPEAKER_33]: So your inner one and or two that goes 2.5.

591
00:57:47,342 --> 00:57:49,902
[SPEAKER_33]: So you're a single family duplex.

592
00:57:50,503 --> 00:57:53,844
[SPEAKER_33]: And then when we go to enter three, you are one.

593
00:57:54,504 --> 00:57:55,184
[SPEAKER_33]: It's three.

594
00:57:55,484 --> 00:57:57,345
[SPEAKER_33]: And also you are two is three.

595
00:57:57,845 --> 00:58:01,626
[SPEAKER_33]: We're just in one of the recommendations is that you are to

596
00:58:04,328 --> 00:58:06,310
[SPEAKER_33]: it has also the incentive zoning.

597
00:58:06,871 --> 00:58:15,020
[SPEAKER_33]: So if they go through incentive zoning and give something back to the community from that many of choices, they could increase from three to four.

598
00:58:16,441 --> 00:58:18,524
[SPEAKER_33]: So those are the changes that we've made.

599
00:58:18,624 --> 00:58:18,944
[SPEAKER_49]: Thank you.

600
00:58:25,413 --> 00:58:25,613
[SPEAKER_42]: questions.

601
00:58:25,633 --> 00:58:25,713
[SPEAKER_42]: Ben.

602
00:58:25,733 --> 00:58:26,273
[SPEAKER_42]: Do you have any questions?

603
00:58:26,514 --> 00:58:29,315
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah I don't want to jump in front of people that might be on the zoom.

604
00:58:29,595 --> 00:58:30,536
[SPEAKER_37]: I have one question.

605
00:58:30,556 --> 00:58:40,661
[SPEAKER_37]: Um and the motivation for the question is that the majority of the proposed and our one zoning seems to be where there's a lot of private ways.

606
00:58:41,782 --> 00:58:46,044
[SPEAKER_37]: And so my question is, has any public input been

607
00:58:54,196 --> 00:58:56,658
[SPEAKER_37]: A lot of the private ways in the city are not in great shape.

608
00:58:57,218 --> 00:59:04,523
[SPEAKER_37]: I actually, I don't know, I don't live on one, but I would imagine that some residents would welcome the city's participation.

609
00:59:04,603 --> 00:59:14,890
[SPEAKER_37]: Some may not, but I'm wondering if that, if we're going to consider such broad zoning changes, whether that has been part of the calculus or not.

610
00:59:31,103 --> 00:59:38,106
[SPEAKER_32]: So converting private ways to public ways is a complicated process.

611
00:59:38,687 --> 00:59:43,449
[SPEAKER_32]: And so there has been conversations among people who live on them when issues have come up.

612
00:59:44,149 --> 00:59:55,414
[SPEAKER_32]: But each road that wants to go from being a private way to a public way has to have a deed search to understand what the ownership of the actual road parcels are.

613
00:59:56,034 --> 01:00:02,936
[SPEAKER_32]: and then there has to be an understanding and delineation of where the public versus private would be, which involves surveys.

614
01:00:03,476 --> 01:00:14,478
[SPEAKER_32]: And then the roads need to be brought up to city standards or they need to have a funding source designated a way, a plan for bringing them up to public standards.

615
01:00:15,118 --> 01:00:18,639
[SPEAKER_32]: We have a lot of information actually on the city's website about this.

616
01:00:18,699 --> 01:00:23,000
[SPEAKER_32]: This has come up in areas in particular where there's already permit parking.

617
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:47,301
[SPEAKER_32]: Um and people on private ways cannot have city permit parking because we can't enforce that But they do have they can sign them themselves and they can actually have vehicles towed themselves off of private ways And so that information and the details the legal requirements there are on the city's website on the parking page Which I can share to the people on zoom for people in the room.

618
01:00:47,381 --> 01:00:49,803
[SPEAKER_32]: It's a little bit harder for me to provide that link

619
01:00:50,563 --> 01:00:53,084
[SPEAKER_32]: Um, but that's sort of the process.

620
01:00:53,164 --> 01:00:59,947
[SPEAKER_32]: I will tell you that as new roads are being built, um, this board actually is the one who approved subdivisions.

621
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:08,690
[SPEAKER_32]: And we require that they get built to public way standards, whether or not they're going to be turned over as a public way.

622
01:01:08,710 --> 01:01:11,672
[SPEAKER_32]: Um, and there are two examples of that recently.

623
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:22,075
[SPEAKER_32]: Um, Mary Kenny way by the high school, sometimes fondly known as the gravel pit that was designed to public way standards and will become a public way.

624
01:01:22,636 --> 01:01:31,962
[SPEAKER_32]: The newer one that was approved can't become a public way because it only connects to a private way and public ways have to connect to public ways.

625
01:01:32,602 --> 01:01:45,149
[SPEAKER_32]: And so since it only goes to a private way, that new cul-de-sac will be a private way, but will be built to city standards because this board would not approve a new road that was not built to city standards.

626
01:01:45,169 --> 01:01:47,931
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't know if that fully answers your question.

627
01:01:47,971 --> 01:01:49,151
[SPEAKER_32]: It's a lot of information.

628
01:01:49,171 --> 01:01:49,772
[SPEAKER_37]: It does.

629
01:01:50,432 --> 01:02:01,377
[SPEAKER_37]: I just would put out there that if we're looking at such comprehensive changes to our city, it might be a public dialogue that's worth having.

630
01:02:02,378 --> 01:02:06,280
[SPEAKER_32]: And if I'll add, that's one of the reasons why there are a number of neighborhoods

631
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:09,401
[SPEAKER_32]: that are very heavy private ways.

632
01:02:09,922 --> 01:02:16,605
[SPEAKER_32]: And those neighborhoods are being recommended to stay NR1 so that their only increased density would be an ADU.

633
01:02:17,185 --> 01:02:23,329
[SPEAKER_32]: And the only optional one would be a special permit ADU, which would be worthy of thinking about.

634
01:02:24,429 --> 01:02:31,093
[SPEAKER_32]: So there are some neighborhoods where people have questioned why are they recommended to stay NR1 or only single family.

635
01:02:31,533 --> 01:02:34,334
[SPEAKER_32]: And it's because they're predominantly private way neighborhoods.

636
01:02:40,530 --> 01:02:41,871
[SPEAKER_42]: John or Ben, any additional thoughts?

637
01:02:42,371 --> 01:02:45,993
[SPEAKER_42]: I do see that Vice Chair Peter Calves has his hand raised.

638
01:02:46,833 --> 01:02:47,113
[SPEAKER_42]: Peter?

639
01:02:49,315 --> 01:02:50,755
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, thank you.

640
01:02:50,775 --> 01:03:08,105
[SPEAKER_22]: The question, and I know some people know that we've spent a lot of time on the lot build outs, but it was very prominent in the city's advertising for this meeting, so I just wanted to get it down pretty

641
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:10,850
[SPEAKER_22]: pretty clearly immediately.

642
01:03:11,270 --> 01:03:38,148
[SPEAKER_22]: Looking at your list of the potential number of units, say, I believe this was for NR3, it looks like the units were three units plus one ADU plus a special permit ADU.

643
01:03:39,936 --> 01:04:04,227
[SPEAKER_22]: implies to me that a building could only build up to four units before it would come before this board and need approval that would require a butter notification and public input and stuff like that, whereas I feel like I was seeing information before this meeting that you could get up to six units in that kind of building.

644
01:04:04,247 --> 01:04:09,270
[SPEAKER_22]: And I just want to make sure before we move forward where

645
01:04:10,153 --> 01:04:11,953
[SPEAKER_22]: Dissonance comes from if I just read something wrong.

646
01:04:15,573 --> 01:04:18,976
[SPEAKER_42]: And please feel free to bring up the tables, the visuals from before.

647
01:04:18,996 --> 01:04:21,237
[SPEAKER_25]: Do you want to bring it up?

648
01:04:21,998 --> 01:04:23,459
[SPEAKER_25]: It may have been a misunderstanding.

649
01:04:23,479 --> 01:04:34,588
[SPEAKER_25]: We've heard a couple of other public comments to the process of a misunderstanding of what can go on which lot, which is one of the reasons we've done the table this way.

650
01:04:35,208 --> 01:04:38,090
[SPEAKER_25]: So you are correct in reading it now.

651
01:04:38,151 --> 01:04:42,334
[SPEAKER_25]: So in the NR3, you can have a table

652
01:04:42,914 --> 01:04:54,537
[SPEAKER_25]: the single unit, the two unit, the three unit, or the historic conversion, you are allowed a protected ADU because there is a single unit, and that would be an as of right ADU per state law.

653
01:04:54,677 --> 01:05:04,819
[SPEAKER_25]: So say you had a three unit dwelling, as was just brought up now, you could add a protected ADU, which is the one under the state law as of right.

654
01:05:05,019 --> 01:05:06,720
[SPEAKER_25]: So now that gives you the three unit,

655
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:14,585
[SPEAKER_25]: plus the ADU which is size restricted so it doesn't become a four unit under zoning it's a three you plus the ADU.

656
01:05:15,245 --> 01:05:33,738
[SPEAKER_25]: And then if you wanted to add one more, it would be a special permit, so that brings it that would with, and that would bring it before the board, as was correctly said so three three unit dwelling, plus an ADU, a second ADU brings it to a special permit which brings it to the community development board.

657
01:05:34,598 --> 01:05:43,523
[SPEAKER_25]: And so you can see on here the protected at us in our one, two and three are all as of right those are the state required at us.

658
01:05:44,104 --> 01:05:49,647
[SPEAKER_25]: You are one and you are to do not allow single family as a right or by special permit.

659
01:05:50,147 --> 01:06:00,773
[SPEAKER_25]: So that means they're not considered single family districts under the law so to keep the single unit to unit and three units consistent with the neighborhood residential

660
01:06:01,193 --> 01:06:16,664
[SPEAKER_25]: There is a local at you as a right for those that means that the multiplex the town and the townhouse building types are not allowed to have a local at you they are also not allowed to have a special permit at you.

661
01:06:17,105 --> 01:06:28,233
[SPEAKER_25]: So in all of these districts, you can have up to two units as one unit as a right one unit by one at you as a right one at you by special permit.

662
01:06:28,573 --> 01:06:32,135
[SPEAKER_25]: but only if you are a one, two, or three unit dwelling.

663
01:06:34,636 --> 01:06:39,299
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you for that clarification, because like I said, as you said previously, this has been a long process.

664
01:06:39,339 --> 01:06:43,161
[SPEAKER_22]: There's a lot of numbers flying around, and some of them have actually changed.

665
01:06:43,261 --> 01:06:50,725
[SPEAKER_22]: So I just wanted to get that clarification, because I know for a lot of the public discourse around this has been about how

666
01:06:51,838 --> 01:06:55,621
[SPEAKER_22]: how many things can spring up by right without public input.

667
01:06:55,761 --> 01:06:59,024
[SPEAKER_22]: And I wanted to make sure that we have that number set.

668
01:06:59,765 --> 01:07:00,425
[SPEAKER_22]: So thank you very much.

669
01:07:00,445 --> 01:07:01,626
[SPEAKER_22]: You're welcome.

670
01:07:06,190 --> 01:07:10,494
[SPEAKER_42]: Adam or Ari, do you have any questions before we move into the public comment?

671
01:07:11,935 --> 01:07:12,595
[SPEAKER_42]: Oh, I see your hand raised.

672
01:07:12,635 --> 01:07:13,156
[SPEAKER_36]: I did, yes.

673
01:07:14,077 --> 01:07:14,357
[SPEAKER_36]: Great.

674
01:07:16,477 --> 01:07:18,298
[SPEAKER_36]: I read through the public comments.

675
01:07:19,078 --> 01:07:38,070
[SPEAKER_36]: I think one of the things that's a little bit hard with zoning in particular is to just understand the timescale at which a lot of these changes will happen, in which a community then evolves from where it is today into the future state that's envisioned by zoning.

676
01:07:39,743 --> 01:07:46,209
[SPEAKER_36]: And so I was just curious from Innis and Associates, it sounds like you guys have done a lot of this work for other communities.

677
01:07:47,571 --> 01:08:01,104
[SPEAKER_36]: Just whether there was information or a case study on cities that might be similar to Medford, and what kind of timeline and scale in terms of build out.

678
01:08:01,404 --> 01:08:02,345
[SPEAKER_36]: And so in a neighborhood,

679
01:08:03,206 --> 01:08:15,092
[SPEAKER_36]: You know, with a lot of concerns, I think, from the West Medford neighborhood about going from single family to urban residential, just like helping better understand how fast does that usually happen?

680
01:08:16,333 --> 01:08:21,496
[SPEAKER_36]: How, you know, what percentage of the lots tend to fill out to the maximum capacity that's allowed?

681
01:08:23,977 --> 01:08:27,040
[SPEAKER_36]: So is this like a five-year time frame?

682
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:28,421
[SPEAKER_36]: Is this a 10-year time frame?

683
01:08:28,461 --> 01:08:30,063
[SPEAKER_36]: Is this a 20-year time frame?

684
01:08:30,764 --> 01:08:38,150
[SPEAKER_36]: Would just be helpful, I think, for me and maybe some people in the community to just intuitively understand this process.

685
01:08:43,055 --> 01:08:43,435
[SPEAKER_25]: Madam Chair?

686
01:08:45,252 --> 01:08:47,333
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes, please.

687
01:08:47,534 --> 01:08:48,614
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you for that question.

688
01:08:48,634 --> 01:08:56,760
[SPEAKER_25]: I can understand how my being able to give you a very specific answer would be helpful to a lot of people.

689
01:08:56,900 --> 01:09:00,062
[SPEAKER_25]: Unfortunately, development is

690
01:09:01,763 --> 01:09:04,605
[SPEAKER_25]: There's a lot of factors that go into development beyond the zoning.

691
01:09:04,765 --> 01:09:20,655
[SPEAKER_25]: So the neighborhood within a city, the city itself, the economic climate that the development is happening in, so in a high interest rate environment, in an environment where

692
01:09:22,136 --> 01:09:29,719
[SPEAKER_25]: There are fewer subsidies for fewer people wanting to invest, makes it more difficult.

693
01:09:30,039 --> 01:09:37,483
[SPEAKER_25]: So I don't know that there is a comparable study that says this exact type of neighborhood would fill out.

694
01:09:37,503 --> 01:09:42,485
[SPEAKER_25]: It also very much depends on whether or not a neighborhood already has a lot of buildings in it.

695
01:09:42,905 --> 01:09:47,267
[SPEAKER_25]: And it's also dependent on who owns that property, right?

696
01:09:47,287 --> 01:09:49,048
[SPEAKER_25]: Zoning offers a choice.

697
01:09:49,608 --> 01:09:57,814
[SPEAKER_25]: It doesn't say you property owner own this it's it's it's single family now you can now go up to three units you must go up to three units.

698
01:09:58,194 --> 01:10:10,422
[SPEAKER_25]: It is always an option for the property owner and I realized that in some neighborhoods, people know their neighbors well and they know that there hasn't been a lot of change and others are have been changes.

699
01:10:11,422 --> 01:10:12,663
[SPEAKER_25]: both in the city and others.

700
01:10:13,223 --> 01:10:21,366
[SPEAKER_25]: I was talking with the community this morning that we have another another city in Massachusetts that we helped with some zoning that would have allowed multifamily.

701
01:10:21,906 --> 01:10:24,027
[SPEAKER_25]: They received absolutely no applications.

702
01:10:24,568 --> 01:10:30,470
[SPEAKER_25]: Other communities have allowed made zoning changes and they get something a little bit more immediate.

703
01:10:31,250 --> 01:10:38,877
[SPEAKER_25]: But there's also the issue of how much housing can be absorbed in one area over a period of years.

704
01:10:38,957 --> 01:10:41,159
[SPEAKER_25]: So I would love to say that there's an easy answer.

705
01:10:41,179 --> 01:10:48,766
[SPEAKER_25]: I hope just by giving you kind of a picture into the different things that people understand that's not an easy answer.

706
01:10:49,647 --> 01:10:55,991
[SPEAKER_25]: When we think of zoning, we think of it as something that will happen over 10, 20, 30 years.

707
01:10:56,512 --> 01:11:00,795
[SPEAKER_25]: But some of that could happen immediately, and some of it could happen fairly down the line.

708
01:11:00,915 --> 01:11:04,817
[SPEAKER_25]: So it is not an easy answer to give, and I do understand how frustrating that is.

709
01:11:07,980 --> 01:11:08,360
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

710
01:11:13,103 --> 01:11:13,663
[SPEAKER_42]: Thanks, Adam.

711
01:11:14,144 --> 01:11:15,265
[SPEAKER_42]: Mari, did you have any questions?

712
01:11:18,066 --> 01:11:18,787
[SPEAKER_35]: No, thank you, though.

713
01:11:19,987 --> 01:11:20,567
[SPEAKER_35]: Great.

714
01:11:27,051 --> 01:11:35,235
[SPEAKER_42]: So the next item on our agenda, which I understand everybody is eagerly anticipating, as am I, is the public comment.

715
01:11:38,066 --> 01:11:39,827
[SPEAKER_42]: We do have a sign-up sheet at the back of the room.

716
01:11:40,348 --> 01:11:43,911
[SPEAKER_42]: If you know you want to comment, we already have two pages up here.

717
01:11:44,731 --> 01:11:49,195
[SPEAKER_42]: But, you know, please add your name to the back or to the sheet in the back.

718
01:11:49,815 --> 01:11:53,438
[SPEAKER_42]: If you have joined us via Zoom, please feel free to raise your hand.

719
01:11:53,458 --> 01:11:57,341
[SPEAKER_42]: I think we're going to kind of like alternate, maybe do like a couple in person.

720
01:11:58,422 --> 01:12:01,283
[SPEAKER_42]: one or two on Zoom, depending on how many people we have.

721
01:12:02,824 --> 01:12:06,505
[SPEAKER_42]: Looks like we have, I don't have the latest sign-up sheet, but we have 30 up here.

722
01:12:06,525 --> 01:12:10,826
[SPEAKER_42]: We have a dozen hands.

723
01:12:10,846 --> 01:12:13,847
[SPEAKER_42]: So let me see.

724
01:12:13,867 --> 01:12:17,869
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm just going to do some quick math.

725
01:12:25,331 --> 01:12:26,612
[SPEAKER_41]: Everybody should see it almost.

726
01:12:27,532 --> 01:12:27,732
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay.

727
01:12:30,222 --> 01:12:36,903
[SPEAKER_42]: So I'm gonna say we're gonna give each person two minutes, and that's kind of like a plus or minus.

728
01:12:37,163 --> 01:12:45,985
[SPEAKER_42]: If you've joined our Zoom meetings before, we want you to finish your thought, finish your question, but please be considerate.

729
01:12:46,005 --> 01:12:50,165
[SPEAKER_42]: We do have a lot of people here tonight, and our goal is to try to get as much public comment as possible.

730
01:12:50,966 --> 01:12:56,526
[SPEAKER_42]: Again, if we can't get through all the public comment tonight, we do have an option to continue to a date certain.

731
01:12:56,807 --> 01:12:59,507
[SPEAKER_42]: So just wanna prepare everyone that that is a potential outcome.

732
01:13:04,148 --> 01:13:14,532
[SPEAKER_42]: And as a reminder, this is the fourth meeting for the continued public hearing that was opened on April 2nd regarding the proposed zoning amendment for the creation of neighborhood and urban residential zoning districts.

733
01:13:15,412 --> 01:13:19,013
[SPEAKER_42]: So we've heard a lot, but we want to keep hearing from you.

734
01:13:21,314 --> 01:13:31,058
[SPEAKER_42]: I do need to state for the record that Adam Behrens has watched recordings of missed meetings and he has signed the Mullen Affidavit.

735
01:13:33,798 --> 01:13:38,694
[SPEAKER_42]: So he is now eligible to vote if we do move this forward.

736
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:45,221
[SPEAKER_42]: So I'm now going to open the public comment period.

737
01:13:45,801 --> 01:13:56,727
[SPEAKER_42]: This is a combination for the accessory dwelling units, as well as the neighborhood and urban residential zoning districts.

738
01:13:57,808 --> 01:14:03,010
[SPEAKER_42]: Those who wish to provide comments can either sign up on the form in the back.

739
01:14:04,291 --> 01:14:11,975
[SPEAKER_42]: We'll also have a period where you can just walk up to the front, but we're going to try to honor the people that have signed up first, as well as through Zoom.

740
01:14:13,928 --> 01:14:15,730
[SPEAKER_42]: If you're on Zoom, use the raise hand feature.

741
01:14:16,431 --> 01:14:19,575
[SPEAKER_42]: You can also send an email to OCD at MedfordMA.gov.

742
01:14:20,355 --> 01:14:25,601
[SPEAKER_42]: Before providing your comments, please state your name and if you're comfortable, your address for the record.

743
01:14:25,621 --> 01:14:30,587
[SPEAKER_42]: A reminder to all meeting participants on Zoom to please refrain from using the chat function.

744
01:14:31,868 --> 01:14:33,430
[SPEAKER_42]: as it's not part of the public record.

745
01:14:34,392 --> 01:14:49,831
[SPEAKER_42]: If you do have audio or technical difficulties on Zoom, please message Jack Podolsky, one of our fearless interns, who will do their best to support you in that.

746
01:14:53,380 --> 01:14:56,601
[SPEAKER_42]: And a quick note because I feel like a couple of past meetings.

747
01:14:56,641 --> 01:15:04,842
[SPEAKER_42]: We've had a pretty solid back and forth during the public comments, which I truly enjoy, but we want to try to get through as many people as possible.

748
01:15:07,143 --> 01:15:11,564
[SPEAKER_42]: The consultants in the city staff might not be responding to every question that is asked.

749
01:15:12,664 --> 01:15:16,885
[SPEAKER_42]: I may highlight some questions that I'd like them to ask board members present.

750
01:15:18,038 --> 01:15:20,841
[SPEAKER_42]: in the chambers as well as on zoom may highlight a question.

751
01:15:20,861 --> 01:15:23,563
[SPEAKER_42]: I know I have to say all this.

752
01:15:24,184 --> 01:15:25,304
[SPEAKER_42]: I appreciate everyone's patience.

753
01:15:27,446 --> 01:15:33,872
[SPEAKER_42]: But if one of your questions is not answered, you will be able to check in with city staff and we'll get to it.

754
01:15:35,794 --> 01:15:36,194
[SPEAKER_40]: Let's see.

755
01:15:38,457 --> 01:15:40,299
[SPEAKER_42]: I know we said a break around 8 15.

756
01:15:40,399 --> 01:15:43,161
[SPEAKER_42]: Um, it doesn't feel like the right time.

757
01:15:43,181 --> 01:15:45,763
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah, let's just get into it, right?

758
01:15:46,424 --> 01:15:54,710
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay, so, uh, the first three public commenters that I have in person, please feel free to line up are Nick Oleg.

759
01:15:55,771 --> 01:16:01,436
[SPEAKER_42]: Mike Corbett and Laura Sela Marriott.

760
01:16:02,176 --> 01:16:03,978
[SPEAKER_42]: And I apologize for any mispronunciation.

761
01:16:08,235 --> 01:16:10,376
[SPEAKER_42]: I was going to do like a group because we have more.

762
01:16:10,396 --> 01:16:15,439
[SPEAKER_42]: Hi, Nick.

763
01:16:16,299 --> 01:16:18,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, checking the mic.

764
01:16:18,281 --> 01:16:21,142
[SPEAKER_42]: Alicia is going to manage the timer and she'll raise hands.

765
01:16:24,504 --> 01:16:27,385
[SPEAKER_42]: I'll have her raise her hand when it's about like 30 seconds.

766
01:16:27,626 --> 01:16:30,527
[SPEAKER_42]: Again, you'll be able to finish your thought, but please respect the time.

767
01:16:31,007 --> 01:16:31,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thanks.

768
01:16:33,441 --> 01:16:35,602
[SPEAKER_07]: I live at 62 Tainer Street.

769
01:16:35,862 --> 01:16:39,003
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to state that I'm very strongly in favor of the proposed rezoning.

770
01:16:39,663 --> 01:16:46,566
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe that the huge amount of work that the CDB, the zoning consultants and city council have done has resulted in a plan that largely gets it right.

771
01:16:47,306 --> 01:16:55,048
[SPEAKER_07]: It sets Medford up well for future growth while ensuring that the newly allowed densification is spread out across the city and not simply concentrated in a few areas.

772
01:16:55,929 --> 01:16:59,330
[SPEAKER_07]: Change can be difficult, but resistance to change has its own costs.

773
01:17:00,050 --> 01:17:03,174
[SPEAKER_07]: Metro Boston and Massachusetts are currently in the midst of a housing crisis.

774
01:17:03,755 --> 01:17:11,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Exclusionary zoning has played a major part in this, and we must move beyond this outdated and ineffective practice if we are truly to meet the moment and address this crisis.

775
01:17:12,325 --> 01:17:14,888
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't just have this power, we have this responsibility.

776
01:17:15,819 --> 01:17:17,080
[SPEAKER_07]: change also comes with positives.

777
01:17:17,761 --> 01:17:27,148
[SPEAKER_07]: More allowable density and more mixed use zoning mean more local businesses, more walkability, a broader tax base, more children in neighborhood schools, more friends and neighbors at block parties.

778
01:17:27,909 --> 01:17:34,234
[SPEAKER_07]: I live in an area that would be up zoned to NR3 under the current plan, and which is immediately next to the Salem Street Corridor.

779
01:17:34,394 --> 01:17:42,861
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm excited to see what the future holds for my neighborhood as it welcomes new owners, new renters, new businesses over the next few years and the coming decades.

780
01:17:44,048 --> 01:17:47,591
[SPEAKER_07]: These plans have been developed with great care and a considerable amount of public consultation.

781
01:17:48,031 --> 01:17:51,613
[SPEAKER_07]: It may not be perfect, no plan is, but it is a good one.

782
01:17:52,334 --> 01:17:56,757
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is not the time to slow down or stop such an important and carefully considered policy measure.

783
01:17:57,658 --> 01:18:08,306
[SPEAKER_07]: After years of zoning recodifications, comprehensive climate, housing and production, housing and, excuse me, comprehensive planning, climate plan and housing plan development,

784
01:18:09,873 --> 01:18:11,757
[SPEAKER_07]: consultations and discussions.

785
01:18:11,937 --> 01:18:15,103
[SPEAKER_07]: We are ready as a city to take this step forward and we must not falter.

786
01:18:15,123 --> 01:18:16,084
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

787
01:18:22,205 --> 01:18:22,525
[SPEAKER_43]: Hi, Mike.

788
01:18:23,165 --> 01:18:23,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

789
01:18:23,585 --> 01:18:24,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, everybody.

790
01:18:24,106 --> 01:18:25,006
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Mike Corbett.

791
01:18:25,106 --> 01:18:27,247
[SPEAKER_04]: I live at 26 Jackson Road.

792
01:18:28,267 --> 01:18:34,649
[SPEAKER_04]: So first of all, I just want to issue a state of gratefulness and thank you to the Community Development Board.

793
01:18:34,809 --> 01:18:35,930
[SPEAKER_04]: I know this is hard work.

794
01:18:36,530 --> 01:18:42,472
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it requires connecting with a lot of people in the city, and I just want to appreciate also the great work that NS has done.

795
01:18:42,492 --> 01:18:44,793
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of information and a lot of slide decks.

796
01:18:45,774 --> 01:18:49,277
[SPEAKER_04]: I unfortunately only started digging into this less than a week ago.

797
01:18:50,438 --> 01:18:54,402
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wanted to start just introduce myself real quickly because I think it's two relevant things.

798
01:18:55,383 --> 01:18:59,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Number one, I'm an engineer, I've been working in engineering and construction for over 20 years.

799
01:19:00,969 --> 01:19:04,413
[SPEAKER_04]: And number two, I've been working in sustainable technologies for the last 15 years.

800
01:19:05,273 --> 01:19:08,976
[SPEAKER_04]: And I bring this up, number one, because I have a relevant background to this.

801
01:19:09,936 --> 01:19:21,504
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, for example, the graphics that Ennis showed today on the frontage and the lot sizes, that is now in a form that a lot of the public can understand, whereas somebody like myself can read through it and kind of get that.

802
01:19:21,524 --> 01:19:25,987
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think we need more of that for the community to understand what these things mean.

803
01:19:26,867 --> 01:19:37,317
[SPEAKER_04]: The second point is, I've issued some notes to the City Council and the Community Development Board on the record that I think were received as if I'm a not-in-my-backyard conservative person.

804
01:19:37,417 --> 01:19:38,719
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually quite progressive.

805
01:19:39,179 --> 01:19:40,861
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe in an increase in housing.

806
01:19:40,961 --> 01:19:50,189
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe we need this, but I believe we need to do this thoughtfully and connecting with the community to make sure that people understand what they're signing up for.

807
01:19:50,950 --> 01:20:11,741
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just found out about this a week ago, as I said, I was lucky enough to have given myself a Father's Day present of taking Friday and Monday off, which I spent as well as Saturday and Sunday digging into every piece of information on the website, asking for more additional information that I could not find on the website.

808
01:20:12,621 --> 01:20:14,462
[SPEAKER_04]: And even with my relative background,

809
01:20:15,042 --> 01:20:18,183
[SPEAKER_04]: and two days to dig through this, I still need more time.

810
01:20:18,623 --> 01:20:21,024
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the rest of the community feels this way as well.

811
01:20:21,404 --> 01:20:27,566
[SPEAKER_04]: The last thing that I'm going to add, the reason why I'm worried is developers coming in and taking advantage of the city.

812
01:20:28,006 --> 01:20:29,746
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been on the other side of this.

813
01:20:30,187 --> 01:20:31,487
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a three-step process.

814
01:20:31,567 --> 01:20:34,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Step one is finding out, okay, what's the zoning?

815
01:20:34,288 --> 01:20:35,008
[SPEAKER_04]: What can I do?

816
01:20:35,528 --> 01:20:41,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Step two is looking at the history of the Zoning Board of Appeals and how quickly do they give out appeals.

817
01:20:41,437 --> 01:20:48,387
[SPEAKER_04]: City of Medford's Zoning Board of Appeals has approved 24 of the last 24 variance requirements.

818
01:20:49,789 --> 01:20:50,610
[SPEAKER_04]: And step three...

819
01:20:52,045 --> 01:20:55,186
[SPEAKER_04]: is then looking at how lenient the building department is.

820
01:20:55,706 --> 01:21:11,331
[SPEAKER_04]: And so unless Medford is looking at this holistically, determining how to staff the Zoning Board of Appeals, how to staff the building department to deal with the influx of most likely variance requests and building approvals, we're not going to be ready for this.

821
01:21:11,592 --> 01:21:11,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

822
01:21:11,952 --> 01:21:12,932
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you.

823
01:21:20,314 --> 01:21:20,815
[SPEAKER_44]: Hi, Laura.

824
01:21:21,655 --> 01:21:21,715
[SPEAKER_44]: Hi.

825
01:21:23,690 --> 01:21:27,454
[SPEAKER_44]: Good evening, Madam Chair and members of the Medford Community Development Board.

826
01:21:28,354 --> 01:21:32,999
[SPEAKER_44]: My name is Laura Chalamet and I live at 1 Arden Road in Medford.

827
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:40,226
[SPEAKER_44]: I'm here to speak in favor of the proposed neighborhood and urban residential zoning changes before the board.

828
01:21:41,487 --> 01:21:47,573
[SPEAKER_44]: The proposed changes ensure that Medford is a welcoming and vibrant city with improved access for all.

829
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:57,346
[SPEAKER_44]: It puts the right kind of density in the right locations, those being main streets, transit hubs, and city squares.

830
01:21:59,027 --> 01:22:09,395
[SPEAKER_44]: The mixed-use provisions will allow Medford to support local businesses and provide much-needed housing, which together create vibrant neighborhoods.

831
01:22:11,314 --> 01:22:21,463
[SPEAKER_44]: These changes will better position Medford to meet goals set forth in the housing production plan by reducing barriers to multifamily and mixed use housing development.

832
01:22:22,563 --> 01:22:32,252
[SPEAKER_44]: It will also allow for a diversity of housing types, including the missing middle and affordable rental and affordable homeownership options.

833
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:43,427
[SPEAKER_44]: Above all, the proposed zoning change will allow us to maintain the safety and the character of Medford while providing for economic and population growth.

834
01:22:45,108 --> 01:22:46,929
[SPEAKER_44]: Medford will continue to grow.

835
01:22:48,010 --> 01:22:50,752
[SPEAKER_44]: This plan ensures it will continue to thrive.

836
01:22:51,212 --> 01:22:51,553
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you.

837
01:22:57,535 --> 01:23:09,422
[SPEAKER_42]: We're now going to take three users from Zoom, but for in-person, the next three that we have are Laura Punnett, Trish Schiapelli, and Peter MacDonald.

838
01:23:10,776 --> 01:23:12,037
[SPEAKER_42]: You can stay in your seats or you can line up.

839
01:23:12,077 --> 01:23:12,637
[SPEAKER_42]: It's up to you.

840
01:23:12,657 --> 01:23:16,158
[SPEAKER_42]: You're going to have at least six minutes before you have to speak.

841
01:23:16,278 --> 01:23:18,559
[SPEAKER_42]: Just try to keep things moving.

842
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:36,887
[SPEAKER_42]: And request for the Zoom participants, if you are able to update your name to a name rather than iPhone or a number or something else, that just helps us kind of keep track of who's spoken and make sure that you know you're being called on.

843
01:23:38,015 --> 01:23:38,095
[SPEAKER_30]: you.

844
01:23:38,115 --> 01:23:39,116
[SPEAKER_30]: Um Alicia, would you mind?

845
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:40,117
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm meeting people.

846
01:23:40,517 --> 01:23:41,998
[SPEAKER_42]: I was just gonna do it right in order.

847
01:23:43,059 --> 01:23:45,881
[SPEAKER_42]: So the first zoom commenter that we have is, uh, 17816.

848
01:23:47,582 --> 01:23:53,167
[SPEAKER_42]: Please state your name and address if you're comfortable for the record.

849
01:24:01,542 --> 01:24:03,023
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you hear me?

850
01:24:03,623 --> 01:24:04,863
[SPEAKER_42]: All right, we're unable to hear 17816.

851
01:24:04,903 --> 01:24:08,745
[SPEAKER_42]: We're going to mute them and we'll come back.

852
01:24:09,365 --> 01:24:14,446
[SPEAKER_42]: The next zoom commenter we have is Alyssa Dedick.

853
01:24:16,947 --> 01:24:23,470
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, this is Chris and Alyssa Dedick from 131 Yale Street.

854
01:24:23,650 --> 01:24:24,550
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you guys hear me?

855
01:24:26,311 --> 01:24:26,931
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes, thank you.

856
01:24:27,732 --> 01:24:28,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

857
01:24:28,832 --> 01:24:29,673
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm here with my wife as well.

858
01:24:30,853 --> 01:24:37,875
[SPEAKER_06]: We're both in, I just wanna say thank you for all your work and we're both in strong support of all of the proposed plans.

859
01:24:38,175 --> 01:24:48,898
[SPEAKER_06]: And we just had a quick question about the building allotment and the building coverage that you guys talked about with the new images earlier.

860
01:24:51,099 --> 01:24:53,799
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess just for reference, the 60% is,

861
01:24:56,570 --> 01:25:01,874
[SPEAKER_06]: is basically like FAR and not like ground level coverage, I guess is the question.

862
01:25:01,954 --> 01:25:14,123
[SPEAKER_06]: So an example would be if you had like a 10,000 square foot lot with the 60% coverage, would that be like 6,000 square foot on the lot?

863
01:25:14,203 --> 01:25:16,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Or like if it's a three stories, it would be 2,000, 2,000, 2,000.

864
01:25:16,925 --> 01:25:17,745
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

865
01:25:17,785 --> 01:25:24,350
[SPEAKER_42]: Chris, do you have any additional questions or comments?

866
01:25:28,212 --> 01:25:28,795
[SPEAKER_42]: Was that a yes?

867
01:25:30,201 --> 01:25:31,045
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, that no.

868
01:25:32,072 --> 01:25:33,053
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay, okay, great.

869
01:25:33,453 --> 01:25:34,794
[SPEAKER_42]: I do think that's a good question.

870
01:25:34,894 --> 01:25:35,995
[SPEAKER_42]: Just for clarification.

871
01:25:38,778 --> 01:25:41,440
[SPEAKER_25]: Through you, Madam Chair, it is not FAR.

872
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:51,348
[SPEAKER_25]: So FAR is floor area ratio, and it refers to the ratio between the lot area and the square footage, the gross square footage of the building.

873
01:25:51,708 --> 01:25:53,850
[SPEAKER_25]: This is just referring to the lot area.

874
01:25:53,910 --> 01:25:58,534
[SPEAKER_25]: So the coverage is 60% of the ground plane or the lot area.

875
01:26:00,862 --> 01:26:01,563
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

876
01:26:02,343 --> 01:26:08,048
[SPEAKER_42]: The next zoom commenter we have Claire Mcgorian.

877
01:26:11,351 --> 01:26:11,711
[SPEAKER_42]: Hello.

878
01:26:11,771 --> 01:26:12,412
[SPEAKER_42]: Can you hear me?

879
01:26:13,473 --> 01:26:13,913
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes, we can.

880
01:26:13,953 --> 01:26:14,514
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you, Claire.

881
01:26:14,894 --> 01:26:15,655
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, terrific.

882
01:26:16,215 --> 01:26:16,796
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, hi.

883
01:26:17,276 --> 01:26:23,281
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, I live at, uh, 82 and 84 Stanley Avenue with my partner, Donna McCormick.

884
01:26:23,401 --> 01:26:25,223
[SPEAKER_18]: We have lived here for 25 years.

885
01:26:25,303 --> 01:26:27,685
[SPEAKER_18]: It's our first and only home that we've lived in.

886
01:26:28,347 --> 01:26:35,548
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a two family and until just a few years ago when COVID hit, we did have tenants, all of whom are great, I have to say.

887
01:26:36,689 --> 01:26:37,589
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's good news.

888
01:26:38,889 --> 01:26:52,392
[SPEAKER_18]: It's an amazing neighborhood, the whole neighborhood, but Stanley Ave in particular and our end of it, which is close to College Ave, we have had the same neighbors, at least the immediate ones, and even other ones that we know down the street for almost that entire time.

889
01:26:53,352 --> 01:26:58,073
[SPEAKER_18]: It's zoned, as far as I know, for single family and two family only.

890
01:26:58,914 --> 01:27:02,417
[SPEAKER_18]: I think the lots are, you know, they're all on the small side.

891
01:27:02,457 --> 01:27:03,718
[SPEAKER_18]: I think ours is under 4,000.

892
01:27:04,258 --> 01:27:06,981
[SPEAKER_18]: I suspect the other ones are too, but I didn't look at my deed.

893
01:27:07,001 --> 01:27:10,744
[SPEAKER_18]: And so I'm a little confused about the proposal.

894
01:27:10,844 --> 01:27:23,195
[SPEAKER_18]: I have to say, I don't think the notification around this was very good because I get every call from the mayor's office and from all the stuff in Medford, and I just heard about this a few days ago, but I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak.

895
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:27,157
[SPEAKER_18]: But I do fear, you know, what this means.

896
01:27:27,197 --> 01:27:34,021
[SPEAKER_18]: So I guess I would one likes, you know, the fear about quality of life, which we have really enjoyed and possibly safety.

897
01:27:34,181 --> 01:27:38,924
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't say that it automatically means anything bad, but this has been such a safe neighborhood for us.

898
01:27:39,304 --> 01:27:44,387
[SPEAKER_18]: I hate to say we've left our keys in the door for longer than I should tell you and never had a problem.

899
01:27:44,907 --> 01:27:47,929
[SPEAKER_18]: So, and the other fear is about the value of our home.

900
01:27:48,409 --> 01:27:52,852
[SPEAKER_18]: I just don't know how these kinds of changes could affect it possibly adversely.

901
01:27:53,492 --> 01:27:59,657
[SPEAKER_18]: So what I want to know on a street like ours is, what is the greatest, I'm sorry, yeah.

902
01:27:59,818 --> 01:28:13,809
[SPEAKER_18]: So if someone can answer this question for me, what is the greatest change that could happen on this street where it's single family, public street, single family and two family, small lots, again, I think they're under 4,000.

903
01:28:14,370 --> 01:28:21,436
[SPEAKER_18]: Am I understanding correctly that this street, they could convert those to three story buildings or is that incorrect?

904
01:28:24,663 --> 01:28:28,224
[SPEAKER_42]: Paola and Emily, did you get the street name that Claire mentioned?

905
01:28:28,244 --> 01:28:31,424
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay.

906
01:28:33,405 --> 01:28:37,186
[SPEAKER_42]: Are you able to answer what the updated zoning would be?

907
01:28:37,206 --> 01:28:42,187
[SPEAKER_25]: I turned the mic on, yes.

908
01:28:43,027 --> 01:28:45,367
[SPEAKER_25]: So she is in the UR1 district.

909
01:28:48,368 --> 01:28:51,089
[SPEAKER_25]: Or in the proposed UR1 district, I should say.

910
01:28:51,129 --> 01:28:52,209
[SPEAKER_25]: So that'd be a pretty big change.

911
01:28:54,352 --> 01:28:54,692
[SPEAKER_25]: It is.

912
01:28:54,712 --> 01:28:58,596
[SPEAKER_25]: It is bigger from she's general residential at the moment.

913
01:28:58,656 --> 01:28:59,356
[SPEAKER_25]: That's correct.

914
01:29:00,717 --> 01:29:02,419
[SPEAKER_25]: We're just confirming what she has at the moment.

915
01:29:02,439 --> 01:29:03,219
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

916
01:29:04,160 --> 01:29:07,283
[SPEAKER_25]: For anybody who wants to follow along, we are using the interactive map.

917
01:29:09,585 --> 01:29:11,366
[SPEAKER_25]: She's general residential at the moment.

918
01:29:11,466 --> 01:29:14,008
[SPEAKER_25]: And if you click on her, did we get her property number?

919
01:29:14,849 --> 01:29:15,990
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

920
01:29:16,010 --> 01:29:17,411
[SPEAKER_25]: We can't give you the exact.

921
01:29:17,671 --> 01:29:19,753
[SPEAKER_18]: It's 82 to 84 Stanley Ave.

922
01:29:20,313 --> 01:29:20,834
[SPEAKER_18]: You need that.

923
01:29:22,538 --> 01:29:23,058
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Claire.

924
01:29:23,078 --> 01:29:23,539
[SPEAKER_43]: Yeah.

925
01:29:23,739 --> 01:29:24,019
[SPEAKER_43]: All right.

926
01:29:24,039 --> 01:29:37,209
[SPEAKER_40]: So the current record actually need to turn it so I can see it.

927
01:29:42,723 --> 01:29:45,165
[SPEAKER_25]: The current so her current lot size is 3250.

928
01:29:46,505 --> 01:29:57,371
[SPEAKER_25]: The minimum, the new minimum lot size would be 4000 so she would actually still be non conforming, because her lot size is smaller.

929
01:29:59,432 --> 01:30:05,056
[SPEAKER_25]: Building height is currently to the allowable zoning so her, her current.

930
01:30:06,216 --> 01:30:23,985
[SPEAKER_25]: current zoning is 6000 square foot lot size, it would be under the new one 4000 so she's currently non conforming for both building height is currently to existing her zoning is 2.5, it would be allowed as a three.

931
01:30:24,686 --> 01:30:30,429
[SPEAKER_25]: There's changes to building coverage between what she has and what would be allowed but essentially she's not conforming now.

932
01:30:31,526 --> 01:30:34,987
[SPEAKER_18]: So I don't want to interrupt and take time, but I'm so sorry, Claire.

933
01:30:35,388 --> 01:30:36,648
[SPEAKER_42]: We have a two minute limit.

934
01:30:37,368 --> 01:30:49,494
[SPEAKER_42]: But I did want to mention to anybody that has specific questions about their own property, Alicia, Danielle, Emily from Innes Associates, as well as Christian will be at Circle the Square this Saturday.

935
01:30:49,894 --> 01:30:55,736
[SPEAKER_42]: So that might be a good time to kind of dig into individual kind of property questions.

936
01:30:57,617 --> 01:31:02,078
[SPEAKER_42]: and maybe drive through the interactive zoning map as well.

937
01:31:04,559 --> 01:31:06,740
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes, we will have that with us, just to answer that.

938
01:31:06,760 --> 01:31:11,801
[SPEAKER_25]: So anybody with individual questions, we'd be happy to go through that with them on Saturday.

939
01:31:12,601 --> 01:31:16,322
[SPEAKER_42]: OK, and we're going to go back to Jim, our first Zoom commenter.

940
01:31:18,623 --> 01:31:20,964
[SPEAKER_42]: Jim, are you able to chat with us?

941
01:31:21,984 --> 01:31:23,184
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, can you hear me this time?

942
01:31:24,205 --> 01:31:25,005
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes, we can hear you.

943
01:31:25,475 --> 01:31:25,715
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

944
01:31:25,816 --> 01:31:26,136
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

945
01:31:26,176 --> 01:31:27,559
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.

946
01:31:28,139 --> 01:31:32,166
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm just a little confused on a name and name and address for the record if you don't mind.

947
01:31:33,528 --> 01:31:35,291
[SPEAKER_01]: Jim Doherty, Arlington Street.

948
01:31:37,506 --> 01:31:39,367
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a little confused.

949
01:31:39,867 --> 01:31:45,109
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've had two meetings regarding the West Medford zoning.

950
01:31:46,349 --> 01:31:49,430
[SPEAKER_01]: They were both postponed because there wasn't a quorum.

951
01:31:50,490 --> 01:32:02,855
[SPEAKER_01]: And the last meeting on the 4th, we were going to discuss it tonight, but it seems like that's kind of fallen by the wayside and we're now having a more globalistic conversation of everything.

952
01:32:04,075 --> 01:32:07,918
[SPEAKER_01]: I like one of the previous speakers who took a lot of time to do the research.

953
01:32:09,580 --> 01:32:15,605
[SPEAKER_01]: I raised a concern because to the contrary, I agree with a lot of the previous speakers.

954
01:32:15,685 --> 01:32:18,487
[SPEAKER_01]: We do need density and we need to do updates.

955
01:32:19,008 --> 01:32:27,555
[SPEAKER_01]: But the reasoning behind the area between Boston Ave and Mystic River Road

956
01:32:28,585 --> 01:32:31,066
[SPEAKER_01]: First, we were told it wasn't in the quarter mile.

957
01:32:31,146 --> 01:32:32,927
[SPEAKER_01]: There wasn't enough transportation.

958
01:32:32,987 --> 01:32:35,809
[SPEAKER_01]: The train only came twice on Saturday.

959
01:32:36,989 --> 01:32:45,374
[SPEAKER_01]: I provided a great deal of information about we have probably more than many parts of Medford, more transportation there.

960
01:32:47,054 --> 01:32:52,497
[SPEAKER_01]: I then, at the next meeting, was advised that the staff elected not to

961
01:32:54,058 --> 01:32:55,119
[SPEAKER_01]: make any changes on it.

962
01:32:55,940 --> 01:33:01,105
[SPEAKER_01]: And the decision was based because it's historically quote unquote, a black neighborhood.

963
01:33:02,086 --> 01:33:11,996
[SPEAKER_01]: I raised a major objection with that the Supreme I've done research on that as well as Supreme Court has ruled against that kind of zoning criteria going back to the early 1900s.

964
01:33:12,096 --> 01:33:13,437
[SPEAKER_01]: I then I then followed up

965
01:33:16,533 --> 01:33:22,796
[SPEAKER_01]: with another email explaining the difference in the housing stock in the neighborhood.

966
01:33:23,396 --> 01:33:31,680
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've spent a lot of time on this as well, but it seems we get no feedback and I'm at a loss.

967
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:35,162
[SPEAKER_01]: Why, where is the information going?

968
01:33:35,542 --> 01:33:37,483
[SPEAKER_01]: And why are we not getting any feedback?

969
01:33:37,523 --> 01:33:40,304
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never had the courtesy of response to either one of those emails.

970
01:33:41,065 --> 01:33:43,406
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I feel like we're being thrown in there.

971
01:33:43,886 --> 01:33:55,912
[SPEAKER_01]: And Wes Medford is not getting a due conversation, whether many parts of it and I agree with some of the speakers, you're making a huge jump from Jim, I'm going to ask you to wrap up your comment, if you don't mind.

972
01:33:56,192 --> 01:34:04,840
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem, I will in one second, within 10 seconds, is you're doing a lot of single-family homes going all the way to UR1.

973
01:34:05,340 --> 01:34:19,753
[SPEAKER_01]: We were always a GR district, which allowed for a three-family, and we're basically stagnant, and we're being disproportionately affected in comparison to other areas of the city, and I've pointed that out in my email.

974
01:34:21,273 --> 01:34:29,076
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for your time, but I think we need to get a little attention, both pro and con of what's taking place over in that area.

975
01:34:32,458 --> 01:34:32,878
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you, Jim.

976
01:34:32,898 --> 01:34:33,798
[SPEAKER_42]: I appreciate your comments.

977
01:34:35,179 --> 01:34:38,180
[SPEAKER_42]: We're now going to move to the in-person commenters.

978
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:44,843
[SPEAKER_42]: So that was Laura Punnett, Trish Ciapelli, and Peter MacDonald.

979
01:34:48,738 --> 01:34:49,058
[SPEAKER_42]: Hi, Trish.

980
01:34:49,099 --> 01:34:50,220
[SPEAKER_42]: It's nice to see you in person.

981
01:34:51,642 --> 01:34:52,162
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm Laura.

982
01:34:52,643 --> 01:34:54,325
[SPEAKER_42]: Oh, then Laura Panet.

983
01:34:54,605 --> 01:34:55,606
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm sorry, Laura.

984
01:34:55,726 --> 01:34:56,748
[SPEAKER_42]: It's nice to see you in person.

985
01:34:58,089 --> 01:34:59,050
[SPEAKER_42]: Sorry, it's been a long day.

986
01:34:59,070 --> 01:35:01,393
[SPEAKER_42]: As I can imagine, it has been for a lot of you.

987
01:35:01,413 --> 01:35:03,936
[SPEAKER_56]: And it's going to be longer before you're getting to go home.

988
01:35:04,277 --> 01:35:05,118
[SPEAKER_56]: We're here for it.

989
01:35:06,738 --> 01:35:08,079
[SPEAKER_56]: My name is Laura Panet.

990
01:35:08,479 --> 01:35:16,164
[SPEAKER_56]: I live at 40 Tesla Avenue, and I've been a homeowner in Medford Hillside since 1987.

991
01:35:16,465 --> 01:35:21,048
[SPEAKER_56]: I'm here speaking also on behalf of my husband, Rafael Moreirazo.

992
01:35:22,028 --> 01:35:24,771
[SPEAKER_56]: and I'm just speaking about the district, the zoning.

993
01:35:25,691 --> 01:35:31,896
[SPEAKER_56]: I'm here to express our strong support for the proposal for residential rezoning.

994
01:35:32,677 --> 01:35:38,121
[SPEAKER_56]: I'm in favor of increasing housing potential in my own neighborhood as well as throughout the city.

995
01:35:38,141 --> 01:35:46,728
[SPEAKER_56]: I and other Medford residents who I know want a more walkable city, more diversity, and more neighbors.

996
01:35:47,649 --> 01:36:02,970
[SPEAKER_56]: It's been my privilege to be a longtime homeowner, and I've really appreciated watching the city evolve over the years, but I can see that this opportunity is being closed to a whole generation of people, because we aren't building enough housing.

997
01:36:03,551 --> 01:36:08,996
[SPEAKER_56]: This shortage, and other speakers have mentioned it, the housing shortage has real impact on people's lives.

998
01:36:09,096 --> 01:36:16,083
[SPEAKER_56]: Not only that it drives up the cost of housing, but also it means that people's quality of life is affected.

999
01:36:16,103 --> 01:36:19,527
[SPEAKER_56]: People have to live farther and farther outside

1000
01:36:20,307 --> 01:36:23,710
[SPEAKER_56]: of Boston in order to find something affordable.

1001
01:36:24,071 --> 01:36:32,658
[SPEAKER_56]: And so people have to commute long distances, which affects their time for families and hobbies and home maintenance and getting enough sleep.

1002
01:36:32,838 --> 01:36:35,461
[SPEAKER_56]: This is actually my professional expertise.

1003
01:36:36,461 --> 01:36:39,464
[SPEAKER_56]: And I could go on on this topic for quite a while.

1004
01:36:39,544 --> 01:36:44,849
[SPEAKER_56]: But the point is we have room for more people right here in Medford, which could reduce some of that stress.

1005
01:36:45,209 --> 01:36:45,610
[SPEAKER_56]: 30 seconds.

1006
01:36:45,870 --> 01:36:52,979
[SPEAKER_56]: I really believe that giving property owners the option to redevelop their property to add more housing is a win-win-win.

1007
01:36:53,400 --> 01:37:03,052
[SPEAKER_56]: It increases the supply of homes, it gives the property owner more flexibility, and it grows the tax base with new growth so that we don't have to do another override in the future.

1008
01:37:03,833 --> 01:37:18,360
[SPEAKER_56]: I call on the board to recommend a pro-housing vision for Medford by reducing single family or NR1As, especially in northwest Medford to spread the density around.

1009
01:37:18,840 --> 01:37:27,324
[SPEAKER_56]: And I also would really appreciate it, I know that you are trying to get input from as many people as possible, but it,

1010
01:37:28,044 --> 01:37:41,474
[SPEAKER_56]: really feels to me like it's time for the board to move forward and allow the city council to do their jobs rather than demanding that people show up over and over again to discuss this topic.

1011
01:37:41,554 --> 01:37:42,935
[SPEAKER_56]: Thank you so much for your time.

1012
01:37:43,176 --> 01:37:43,636
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you, Laura.

1013
01:37:50,684 --> 01:37:54,225
[SPEAKER_17]: Good evening, Trisha Kelly, 53 Garfield Avenue.

1014
01:37:55,045 --> 01:38:01,728
[SPEAKER_17]: So in my opinion, I agree that we do need more housing and we need a facelift in Medford and we do need to get up to date.

1015
01:38:02,449 --> 01:38:08,952
[SPEAKER_17]: I do not think, however, that we have done enough thought process and strategic thinking on this.

1016
01:38:09,592 --> 01:38:16,155
[SPEAKER_17]: My concern is that there's never been any conversation around what the infrastructure can handle with regard to electric.

1017
01:38:16,755 --> 01:38:19,756
[SPEAKER_17]: sewer, water, all the lead pipes that we have.

1018
01:38:20,236 --> 01:38:28,760
[SPEAKER_17]: So I feel to add more density without really fixing some of the things that we have first is going to cause brownouts.

1019
01:38:29,590 --> 01:38:34,651
[SPEAKER_17]: sewage backups during horrible, horrible storms and other issues.

1020
01:38:35,231 --> 01:38:43,013
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think that we need to fix what we have and then be thoughtful and in a process and then bring people in.

1021
01:38:43,493 --> 01:38:44,694
[SPEAKER_17]: What can the police handle?

1022
01:38:44,754 --> 01:38:46,454
[SPEAKER_17]: We've never had a conversation around that.

1023
01:38:46,774 --> 01:38:47,975
[SPEAKER_17]: What can fire handle?

1024
01:38:48,315 --> 01:38:49,515
[SPEAKER_17]: And why would you ever

1025
01:38:50,075 --> 01:38:56,140
[SPEAKER_17]: say that Medford, the gone are the days of the single family house, like some of the people on city council.

1026
01:38:56,580 --> 01:38:58,441
[SPEAKER_17]: That is what Medford was built on.

1027
01:38:58,501 --> 01:39:18,316
[SPEAKER_17]: And I feel like if the state can push back on the federal government for things they don't want to do, I believe that our city should be able to push back on the state with what the majority of homeowners, property owners, taxpayers and voters would like in the environment that they want to live.

1028
01:39:19,177 --> 01:39:19,477
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1029
01:39:22,002 --> 01:39:22,492
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you, Chris.

1030
01:39:29,504 --> 01:39:29,964
[SPEAKER_43]: Hi, Peter.

1031
01:39:29,984 --> 01:39:31,485
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, my name is Peter McDowell.

1032
01:39:31,545 --> 01:39:37,389
[SPEAKER_10]: I live at 56 Otter Street, and I was blessed to work for the Medford Fire Department for 29 years.

1033
01:39:37,730 --> 01:39:38,370
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you for your service.

1034
01:39:38,390 --> 01:39:46,476
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe that I've been on every street in the city doing duties between emergency calls and routine check and hydrants and whatnot.

1035
01:39:47,016 --> 01:39:52,059
[SPEAKER_10]: My family's been in Medford for over 150 years, living in single family houses.

1036
01:39:52,120 --> 01:39:53,841
[SPEAKER_10]: Luckily, we were blessed to have them.

1037
01:39:55,033 --> 01:40:08,156
[SPEAKER_10]: One of my great-great-grandparents, George Davenport, who the Davenport School was named after, was involved with George Wright and Middlesex Fells, preserving three square miles of Method out of eight square miles.

1038
01:40:08,536 --> 01:40:09,877
[SPEAKER_10]: We're never gonna get more room.

1039
01:40:10,657 --> 01:40:21,319
[SPEAKER_10]: If people wanna tear down all the woods, we can have another 30,000 people in the Middlesex Fells, but we decided a long time ago we needed some green space in the 1890s and the 1880s.

1040
01:40:24,638 --> 01:40:29,800
[SPEAKER_10]: According to some of these, the state has passed the ADU.

1041
01:40:30,920 --> 01:40:39,863
[SPEAKER_10]: So because of that, thousands of single family houses in Method are allowed to build an extra unit, which is increasing housing.

1042
01:40:40,844 --> 01:40:47,366
[SPEAKER_10]: But on the call from City Hall that I got on my landline saying that

1043
01:40:48,501 --> 01:41:15,573
[SPEAKER_10]: 4,000 square foot lot could end up having three plus one units, or a family's lot is over 8,000 feet, that if it met all the requirements that there could be split and have three and three and another unit, that you're potentially putting eight units where there was a single family, and how is that fair to the other neighbors with single families that

1044
01:41:16,438 --> 01:41:25,124
[SPEAKER_10]: We can convert all these single families that are over 8,000 to eight units, but where's the fairness to the people who were here before?

1045
01:41:25,865 --> 01:41:29,868
[SPEAKER_10]: We're gonna have the state mandate increasing thousands of units.

1046
01:41:31,069 --> 01:41:39,035
[SPEAKER_10]: We have certain options that we've had thousands of units added in the past 20 years between River's Edge,

1047
01:41:40,268 --> 01:41:52,042
[SPEAKER_10]: Locust Street, and we have room for a lot more between Mystic Ave, the Parkway, this space where 15-story buildings are not imposed upon three-story neighborhoods.

1048
01:41:52,783 --> 01:41:53,083
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1049
01:42:05,325 --> 01:42:08,846
[SPEAKER_42]: So we're gonna move back to three Zoom commenters, and then three in-person.

1050
01:42:11,688 --> 01:42:24,213
[SPEAKER_42]: The three in-person people that are on deck or in the hole, not really a sports person, are Alexander Pancic, Mary Louise O'Brien, and Paige Baldini.

1051
01:42:24,233 --> 01:42:27,954
[SPEAKER_42]: Feel free to stay in your seats, but just heads up that it's coming your way.

1052
01:42:28,975 --> 01:42:33,917
[SPEAKER_42]: The next commenter we have on Zoom is Jeremy Martin.

1053
01:42:36,149 --> 01:42:37,730
[SPEAKER_42]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1054
01:42:37,830 --> 01:42:39,110
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening, everyone.

1055
01:42:39,170 --> 01:42:39,830
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeremy Martin.

1056
01:42:39,870 --> 01:42:52,554
[SPEAKER_00]: I live on Burgett Avenue in the Hillside neighborhood, probably one of the neighborhoods that will see some of the most drastic change from a predominant single family neighborhood to the potential of four and six units.

1057
01:42:52,574 --> 01:43:00,777
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very much in favor of this proposal, and I want to commend the city, the staff, the consultants for our process.

1058
01:43:01,557 --> 01:43:06,621
[SPEAKER_00]: I disagree with some of the notions that this process hasn't been thoughtful, that people haven't been heard.

1059
01:43:06,641 --> 01:43:17,028
[SPEAKER_00]: I've personally been to six meetings between the city council and the CDB, and I've both seen comments made and seen changes come out of them, and I appreciate that very much.

1060
01:43:18,790 --> 01:43:28,357
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a perfect process, and I've had my own frustrations, but I think that any sort of planning process of this ambition and this scale is not going to be perfect.

1061
01:43:28,777 --> 01:43:29,597
[SPEAKER_00]: We should not let

1062
01:43:33,342 --> 01:43:34,243
[SPEAKER_00]: that's really good.

1063
01:43:34,703 --> 01:43:38,027
[SPEAKER_00]: Frankly, the change that people are concerned about too much

1064
01:43:42,852 --> 01:43:44,194
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of those things are already here.

1065
01:43:44,234 --> 01:43:45,215
[SPEAKER_00]: The development is here.

1066
01:43:45,255 --> 01:43:46,296
[SPEAKER_00]: The change is coming.

1067
01:43:46,817 --> 01:43:50,881
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to take the opportunity to take control of that, to put some boundaries around it.

1068
01:43:50,981 --> 01:43:52,703
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the opportunity to do that.

1069
01:43:53,183 --> 01:43:55,766
[SPEAKER_00]: The status quo is not working for our community.

1070
01:43:56,847 --> 01:44:01,192
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a couple of specific comments on the proposal, which I think is really good.

1071
01:44:03,274 --> 01:44:14,925
[SPEAKER_00]: I would encourage, again, the potential for more development and more density to be located near primary open spaces of the Mystic River and the fells.

1072
01:44:14,945 --> 01:44:15,105
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 seconds.

1073
01:44:15,125 --> 01:44:18,588
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to give people the opportunity to live closer to those places.

1074
01:44:19,269 --> 01:44:23,933
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't buy the argument about topography or dead ends or private ways.

1075
01:44:24,614 --> 01:44:25,716
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're going to be able to do that.

1076
01:44:25,736 --> 01:44:27,038
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be able to do that.

1077
01:44:27,078 --> 01:44:32,105
[SPEAKER_00]: Precluding that right across the street from my house is a nearly 300 unit building going up on a very steep site.

1078
01:44:32,546 --> 01:44:33,908
[SPEAKER_00]: The primary access to that

1079
01:44:39,896 --> 01:44:47,202
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope we will eliminate the small pockets of urban residential 3 that are within NR1 areas.

1080
01:44:47,282 --> 01:44:48,243
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me, I have it backwards.

1081
01:44:48,863 --> 01:44:53,026
[SPEAKER_00]: Urban residential NR3 within UR1 areas.

1082
01:44:53,847 --> 01:45:00,272
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope that the staff find a way to apply more of the green score principles to residential development.

1083
01:45:00,312 --> 01:45:05,336
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to find ways to stop developers from coming in, cutting down trees, and building big houses.

1084
01:45:05,376 --> 01:45:08,378
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have that in this proposal yet, and it's incredibly important.

1085
01:45:08,858 --> 01:45:09,759
[SPEAKER_42]: comment, Jeremy.

1086
01:45:10,139 --> 01:45:10,460
[SPEAKER_42]: That's it.

1087
01:45:10,600 --> 01:45:10,920
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1088
01:45:12,021 --> 01:45:12,701
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you so much.

1089
01:45:24,332 --> 01:45:29,394
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street, my neighborhood we zoned as NR3.

1090
01:45:31,214 --> 01:45:36,316
[SPEAKER_11]: The zoning that is in the current filings folder didn't match the dimensional standards that were presented tonight.

1091
01:45:36,356 --> 01:45:38,717
[SPEAKER_11]: The building coverage among other things has changed.

1092
01:45:39,217 --> 01:45:42,518
[SPEAKER_11]: It's hard for the public to consistently know what is actually on the table.

1093
01:45:43,038 --> 01:45:45,839
[SPEAKER_11]: The map from the city council is what was presented tonight.

1094
01:45:46,299 --> 01:45:48,260
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that the map that is now being considered?

1095
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:52,321
[SPEAKER_11]: Is all the density near the commuter rail and green line gone and reverted back?

1096
01:45:52,561 --> 01:45:56,804
[SPEAKER_11]: to less than the density at Glenwood with no rapid transit and only one bus?

1097
01:45:57,765 --> 01:46:11,216
[SPEAKER_11]: All the discussion of the negatives about density are centered on the least densely zoned areas and none about the more dense areas that already have some of the negatives, the less dense don't want, but we are being pushed further.

1098
01:46:11,796 --> 01:46:15,079
[SPEAKER_11]: Why are only private roads in NR1 being kept less dense?

1099
01:46:15,499 --> 01:46:20,103
[SPEAKER_11]: There are around 14 private streets in Glenwood and they all find themselves zoned at NR3

1100
01:46:20,763 --> 01:46:24,164
[SPEAKER_11]: with no special attention paid to the fact they are also private ways.

1101
01:46:24,965 --> 01:46:31,227
[SPEAKER_11]: If we are rolling back the areas with transit access, then Glenwood should not remain at or above their level of density.

1102
01:46:31,287 --> 01:46:32,187
[SPEAKER_11]: We are already dense.

1103
01:46:32,567 --> 01:46:42,151
[SPEAKER_11]: We already have flippers knocking on our doors to buy our lots that sell for lower prices because we are an EJ neighborhood and are being zoned to turn into a luxury urban neighborhood.

1104
01:46:42,951 --> 01:46:48,553
[SPEAKER_11]: The City has already said Glenwood is facing development pressure and that is why Salem Street Corridor was zoned first.

1105
01:46:49,014 --> 01:46:50,754
[SPEAKER_11]: It will happen more quickly for us.

1106
01:46:51,314 --> 01:46:53,095
[SPEAKER_11]: There were no studies on infrastructure.

1107
01:46:53,735 --> 01:47:00,398
[SPEAKER_11]: Going from one to two units in my neighborhood to three to five per lot will cause issues that we are not prepared for.

1108
01:47:01,038 --> 01:47:04,280
[SPEAKER_11]: Parking minimum changes are already being discussed.

1109
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:11,665
[SPEAKER_11]: So it is disingenuous for the consultants to suggest that parking is what will keep this zoning from actually happening.

1110
01:47:11,965 --> 01:47:13,506
[SPEAKER_11]: This zoning will happen to us.

1111
01:47:13,846 --> 01:47:17,249
[SPEAKER_11]: People will own cars, but they won't have parking for them.

1112
01:47:17,929 --> 01:47:19,490
[SPEAKER_11]: Please do something about this.

1113
01:47:19,590 --> 01:47:28,256
[SPEAKER_11]: Please send some time on Glenwood and not only talk about the NR1 and the NR2 areas, which will be markedly less dense than we will be.

1114
01:47:28,536 --> 01:47:28,957
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1115
01:47:28,977 --> 01:47:33,040
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you, Cheryl.

1116
01:47:38,143 --> 01:47:40,266
[SPEAKER_42]: And just to disambiguate, I think I heard a question over there.

1117
01:47:40,386 --> 01:47:41,747
[SPEAKER_42]: EJ is environmental justice.

1118
01:47:42,268 --> 01:47:44,551
[SPEAKER_42]: So she had used that acronym.

1119
01:47:52,060 --> 01:47:54,302
[SPEAKER_42]: The next Zoom commenter that we have is Zoe.

1120
01:47:58,077 --> 01:48:03,720
[SPEAKER_38]: Hi, this is Zoe Moutzas from 33 Johnson Ave in West Medford.

1121
01:48:04,421 --> 01:48:12,786
[SPEAKER_38]: This is my fourth meeting in this process, and I just want to say that the presentations get better every time, so thank you to Innes.

1122
01:48:13,406 --> 01:48:20,272
[SPEAKER_38]: for continuing to give, give pictures where charts are getting very confusing for those of us who don't have a background in that.

1123
01:48:21,273 --> 01:48:36,807
[SPEAKER_38]: So I really appreciate that and also really starting to put together the pieces of how the mixed use commercial zoning is fed by the neighborhood and residential zoning and I'm excited for what can happen in West Medford.

1124
01:48:38,168 --> 01:48:42,089
[SPEAKER_38]: changes really hard, and I'm a little nervous about what might happen.

1125
01:48:42,109 --> 01:48:51,532
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm in a zone that the City Council recommended as NR3, but the board has us tagged as UR1.

1126
01:48:52,032 --> 01:48:59,194
[SPEAKER_38]: And today you shared a chart that really kind of highlighted the differences between that.

1127
01:48:59,374 --> 01:49:06,296
[SPEAKER_38]: And I did have a question, and it came up when Paola was talking about parking and how

1128
01:49:07,216 --> 01:49:16,260
[SPEAKER_38]: if you used a permeable surface for parking, you actually could fit a larger number of people or units into a space.

1129
01:49:16,600 --> 01:49:23,683
[SPEAKER_38]: I had a question about what is permeable parking because is that dirt, pebbles?

1130
01:49:24,103 --> 01:49:25,103
[SPEAKER_38]: What are we talking about?

1131
01:49:25,143 --> 01:49:31,366
[SPEAKER_38]: Because I really feel like NR3 is appropriate for the Johnson Tyler Ave area.

1132
01:49:31,426 --> 01:49:32,586
[SPEAKER_38]: We already have

1133
01:49:34,607 --> 01:49:39,330
[SPEAKER_38]: Some some 2 family homes here single family and it's a mix i think you are 1.

1134
01:49:39,590 --> 01:49:52,257
[SPEAKER_38]: It to me feels a little bit over what i would feel comfortable with and that permeable parking made my ears perk up because i don't understand what that is but it kind of feels like it could.

1135
01:49:53,146 --> 01:50:03,548
[SPEAKER_38]: maybe cheat at providing green space, which is actually what I'm very concerned about in our little, we live in an urban heat island, and I'm worried about that.

1136
01:50:04,508 --> 01:50:10,650
[SPEAKER_38]: Overall, I think that this zoning, I'm excited for it to happen for all the reasons that people have said.

1137
01:50:10,670 --> 01:50:21,012
[SPEAKER_38]: And I'm excited to get a more walkable, a little bit more dense Medford and to help alleviate some of the housing challenges that folks, you know, up and down the spectrum are having.

1138
01:50:21,092 --> 01:50:21,892
[SPEAKER_38]: So thanks so much.

1139
01:50:24,059 --> 01:50:24,419
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

1140
01:50:24,439 --> 01:50:25,559
[SPEAKER_42]: Thanks, Zoe.

1141
01:50:25,579 --> 01:50:28,640
[SPEAKER_42]: Um, can we clarify what permeable papers are?

1142
01:50:29,240 --> 01:50:32,421
[SPEAKER_42]: Do we have a visual for it or just talk about it?

1143
01:50:33,481 --> 01:50:33,741
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

1144
01:50:33,901 --> 01:50:37,842
[SPEAKER_25]: So we are happy through the chair to define permeable surfaces.

1145
01:50:37,882 --> 01:50:38,762
[SPEAKER_25]: It is not dirt.

1146
01:50:39,443 --> 01:50:43,224
[SPEAKER_25]: Um, just to make that clear to everybody, it would have to be a structured parking lot.

1147
01:50:43,284 --> 01:50:49,085
[SPEAKER_25]: And so surfaces that would be permeable permeable means that water can infiltrate through the surface.

1148
01:50:49,725 --> 01:50:57,376
[SPEAKER_25]: So surface that would be permeable and acceptable for parking are defined in the green score but just a couple of them, gravel would be allowed.

1149
01:50:57,396 --> 01:51:00,861
[SPEAKER_25]: There are pavers that allow for permeability through that.

1150
01:51:01,301 --> 01:51:04,526
[SPEAKER_25]: So, those sorts of pavers, that would be acceptable.

1151
01:51:05,823 --> 01:51:10,609
[SPEAKER_33]: Yeah, you also have like the type of prefab tiles that go over grass.

1152
01:51:10,889 --> 01:51:15,896
[SPEAKER_33]: Those, for example, provide enough structure for a car to go over and be permeable enough.

1153
01:51:16,797 --> 01:51:23,725
[SPEAKER_25]: So those are what would be required for a permeable parking space for the question that we received.

1154
01:51:23,745 --> 01:51:24,987
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1155
01:51:30,677 --> 01:51:33,207
[SPEAKER_42]: All right, we're back to our in-person commenters.

1156
01:51:33,227 --> 01:51:36,199
[SPEAKER_42]: We have Alexander, Mary Louise, and Paige.

1157
01:51:38,243 --> 01:51:40,044
[SPEAKER_57]: Hi, my name is Alexander Panchage.

1158
01:51:40,144 --> 01:51:44,806
[SPEAKER_57]: I live at 12 Cushing Street, and that's also in the Glenwood area.

1159
01:51:45,346 --> 01:51:53,510
[SPEAKER_57]: And I'm coming a little late to this, and I don't have prepared comments like so many other people have.

1160
01:51:54,130 --> 01:51:55,251
[SPEAKER_57]: So I'll try to do my best here.

1161
01:51:55,271 --> 01:51:59,993
[SPEAKER_57]: I'm concerned about a few things, especially in my area.

1162
01:52:00,713 --> 01:52:05,556
[SPEAKER_57]: From what I understand, our area is right now basically two family houses.

1163
01:52:06,536 --> 01:52:26,574
[SPEAKER_57]: and making it R3 allows someone to come into an existing structure, turn into four units, plus an ADU, plus another ADU, basically six units, without having any change to the parking, because it's already an existing structure.

1164
01:52:28,879 --> 01:52:34,220
[SPEAKER_57]: I don't think that this is actually going to do what a lot of people think it's going to do.

1165
01:52:34,280 --> 01:52:36,761
[SPEAKER_57]: I don't think that it's going to give more housing.

1166
01:52:36,801 --> 01:52:49,163
[SPEAKER_57]: I think what's going to happen is a developer will come in, outbid anyone else who can buy the house because they will convert it into four units, plus one or plus two.

1167
01:52:50,083 --> 01:52:53,684
[SPEAKER_57]: Then they will turn the ADU,

1168
01:52:54,735 --> 01:52:58,357
[SPEAKER_57]: into a B&B so they can rent that out.

1169
01:52:59,057 --> 01:53:06,941
[SPEAKER_57]: And you'll basically have just a smaller unit that everyone's going to be paying the same amount of rent for.

1170
01:53:07,041 --> 01:53:12,824
[SPEAKER_57]: So everyone will wind up just spending more money for less space and be more crowded.

1171
01:53:12,844 --> 01:53:13,924
[SPEAKER_57]: 30 seconds.

1172
01:53:18,303 --> 01:53:25,567
[SPEAKER_57]: I think a lot of people are working from home now, and that does mean that they want a bigger space inside.

1173
01:53:26,688 --> 01:53:36,132
[SPEAKER_57]: And I also agree that we've put in a thousand or more units already in Medford, and I don't think we should just ignore the fact that we have done that.

1174
01:53:36,673 --> 01:53:37,013
[SPEAKER_57]: Thank you.

1175
01:53:38,013 --> 01:53:38,874
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you, Alexander.

1176
01:53:43,493 --> 01:53:44,153
[SPEAKER_25]: Madam Chair?

1177
01:53:45,534 --> 01:53:45,994
[SPEAKER_25]: Madam Chair?

1178
01:53:46,555 --> 01:53:46,775
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

1179
01:53:47,115 --> 01:54:04,403
[SPEAKER_25]: We just want to correct a couple of numbers just so everybody understands that an NR3 is limited to, ignoring historic conversion for a moment, is limited to a three-unit dwelling, plus a by-right ADU, plus a special permit ADU.

1180
01:54:04,783 --> 01:54:10,206
[SPEAKER_25]: Short-term rental of ADUs is prohibited in the proposed language, just so everyone knows.

1181
01:54:10,886 --> 01:54:12,347
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay, thank you for that clarification.

1182
01:54:15,172 --> 01:54:15,933
[SPEAKER_42]: Hi, Mary Louise?

1183
01:54:17,135 --> 01:54:17,315
[SPEAKER_42]: No?

1184
01:54:19,097 --> 01:54:22,302
[SPEAKER_42]: Is Mary Louise O'Brien here?

1185
01:54:22,322 --> 01:54:26,327
[SPEAKER_42]: We'll come back to them.

1186
01:54:26,768 --> 01:54:27,549
[SPEAKER_28]: So you must be Paige.

1187
01:54:29,290 --> 01:54:29,670
[SPEAKER_28]: Hi there.

1188
01:54:30,151 --> 01:54:34,755
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm Paige Valdini, 37 Winter Street, and I own a business at 319 Boston Ave.

1189
01:54:35,375 --> 01:54:39,859
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you so much to the board, staff, and everyone who's worked so hard on the zoning reform process.

1190
01:54:40,640 --> 01:54:46,626
[SPEAKER_28]: Medford has been praised for its work over the last few months, many months, and that effort deserves credit.

1191
01:54:46,786 --> 01:54:47,526
[SPEAKER_28]: I want to be clear.

1192
01:54:47,586 --> 01:54:49,888
[SPEAKER_28]: I support more housing, especially affordable housing.

1193
01:54:50,389 --> 01:54:54,272
[SPEAKER_28]: And I understand that this intention is not for all of this development to happen right away.

1194
01:54:55,073 --> 01:54:56,734
[SPEAKER_28]: but that doesn't mean we shouldn't be prepared.

1195
01:54:57,795 --> 01:55:02,379
[SPEAKER_28]: I own a small business at 319 Boston Ave in a block that's 100% non-conforming.

1196
01:55:02,999 --> 01:55:10,205
[SPEAKER_28]: This quarter, like Mystic Ave and Medford Square, are exactly where we should be looking to build mixed-use space that blends housing with business.

1197
01:55:10,745 --> 01:55:18,451
[SPEAKER_28]: But without clear support from existing businesses, we risk losing the local services and economic activity that are already working in these areas.

1198
01:55:19,152 --> 01:55:20,933
[SPEAKER_28]: I've submitted questions to this board

1199
01:55:21,874 --> 01:55:24,977
[SPEAKER_28]: The City Council, the Office of Planning and Development, and the Mayor's Office.

1200
01:55:25,077 --> 01:55:30,821
[SPEAKER_28]: They are thoughtful, practical questions about timelines, infrastructures, and support, and they remained unanswered.

1201
01:55:31,422 --> 01:55:36,285
[SPEAKER_28]: Not likely because people don't care, but likely because this process is moving too fast.

1202
01:55:37,066 --> 01:55:43,069
[SPEAKER_28]: We have been told about city developments that have been consulted, but those conversations and findings have not been made public.

1203
01:55:43,710 --> 01:55:53,095
[SPEAKER_28]: The community deserves to see the infrastructure studies, service impact projections, and research that's guiding these decisions to speak to the board's member question earlier, if possible.

1204
01:55:54,015 --> 01:56:00,159
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's also hear directly from departments like fire, police, traffic enforcement, public works, permitting, and building.

1205
01:56:00,660 --> 01:56:04,122
[SPEAKER_28]: How are they preparing for what this means to day-to-day operations?

1206
01:56:04,142 --> 01:56:05,203
[SPEAKER_28]: 30 seconds.

1207
01:56:05,803 --> 01:56:10,947
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's make information public clearly in plain language so we can all understand what's being planned.

1208
01:56:11,547 --> 01:56:13,829
[SPEAKER_28]: This is a long-term investment in Medford's future.

1209
01:56:13,909 --> 01:56:14,769
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's be thoughtful.

1210
01:56:14,809 --> 01:56:15,830
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's be transparent.

1211
01:56:15,930 --> 01:56:18,532
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's do it together with everyone informed and ready.

1212
01:56:19,112 --> 01:56:20,153
[SPEAKER_28]: Please don't rush this vote.

1213
01:56:20,533 --> 01:56:22,435
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's take the time to make the best that we can.

1214
01:56:23,435 --> 01:56:23,895
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1215
01:56:25,457 --> 01:56:26,738
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Paige.

1216
01:56:43,532 --> 01:56:44,473
[SPEAKER_42]: Hi, sir, in the green.

1217
01:56:45,153 --> 01:56:49,697
[SPEAKER_42]: We did have a sign up, but since we only did two commenters, the last one, the list, did you call it?

1218
01:56:49,737 --> 01:56:50,918
[SPEAKER_48]: The name is Andrew number 18.

1219
01:56:53,268 --> 01:56:54,709
[SPEAKER_42]: We have not called you yet, Andrew.

1220
01:56:55,390 --> 01:56:56,311
[SPEAKER_42]: But thank you for checking.

1221
01:56:56,351 --> 01:56:57,412
[SPEAKER_48]: Do you see it?

1222
01:56:57,432 --> 01:56:57,632
[SPEAKER_42]: I do.

1223
01:56:58,052 --> 01:56:59,153
[SPEAKER_42]: Andrew of East Medford.

1224
01:56:59,173 --> 01:56:59,673
[SPEAKER_48]: Should I wait?

1225
01:56:59,753 --> 01:57:01,995
[SPEAKER_48]: I'll come back tomorrow.

1226
01:57:06,250 --> 01:57:09,993
[SPEAKER_42]: I appreciate your glib question, but I will answer it seriously.

1227
01:57:10,013 --> 01:57:13,256
[SPEAKER_42]: We're giving each commenter two minutes to speak.

1228
01:57:14,117 --> 01:57:18,281
[SPEAKER_42]: We have gotten through seven in person.

1229
01:57:18,401 --> 01:57:20,563
[SPEAKER_42]: We have gotten through, I think, six online.

1230
01:57:20,583 --> 01:57:23,786
[SPEAKER_42]: We have 23 more to go in person.

1231
01:57:27,196 --> 01:57:28,598
[SPEAKER_42]: And we have 20 more to go.

1232
01:57:28,738 --> 01:57:34,664
[SPEAKER_42]: So if you can calculate that times 20, then you can make your decision, but I'm not able to make that decision for you tonight.

1233
01:57:34,784 --> 01:57:36,766
[SPEAKER_48]: So you have no guarantees.

1234
01:57:36,806 --> 01:57:37,586
[SPEAKER_48]: Thank you for your time.

1235
01:57:38,067 --> 01:57:38,487
[SPEAKER_42]: Of course.

1236
01:57:41,470 --> 01:57:43,732
[SPEAKER_42]: And again, we're going to evaluate around 9.45.

1237
01:57:45,654 --> 01:57:49,998
[SPEAKER_42]: You know, we're all doing our best and I appreciate everyone's patience as well as being here.

1238
01:57:53,189 --> 01:57:57,350
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay, well before we switch, any update on Mary Louise O'Brien?

1239
01:57:59,190 --> 01:58:01,071
[SPEAKER_42]: No, okay, we'll continue to come back to them.

1240
01:58:04,711 --> 01:58:11,833
[SPEAKER_42]: Oh yes, so the next three after we take the Zoom commenters are Elise Jennings, Anne Haggerty, and Tom Lincoln.

1241
01:58:12,373 --> 01:58:15,014
[SPEAKER_42]: Feel free to stay in your seats, but you are on deck.

1242
01:58:16,174 --> 01:58:20,575
[SPEAKER_42]: Our Zoom commenters, Paul Geraghty,

1243
01:58:24,220 --> 01:58:24,680
[SPEAKER_45]: Good evening.

1244
01:58:25,521 --> 01:58:26,562
[SPEAKER_45]: My name is Paul Garrity.

1245
01:58:26,582 --> 01:58:28,603
[SPEAKER_45]: I live at 40 Cedar Road in Medford.

1246
01:58:29,023 --> 01:58:32,886
[SPEAKER_45]: My question has to do with the historical conversion.

1247
01:58:34,026 --> 01:58:42,172
[SPEAKER_45]: When reviewing the write-up, it said that the historical confusion could not change the look of the building.

1248
01:58:43,132 --> 01:58:46,274
[SPEAKER_45]: I also saw there was a slide tonight that added to the 75-year

1249
01:58:48,299 --> 01:58:50,060
[SPEAKER_45]: requirement and some other verbiage.

1250
01:58:50,560 --> 01:58:56,461
[SPEAKER_45]: I would hope that we can be relatively clear and detailed on what it means by change the look of the building.

1251
01:58:56,501 --> 01:59:11,685
[SPEAKER_45]: The reason why I say that is that in the neighborhood, not too many years past, there was a terrific amount of tension between the neighbors and the builders because there wasn't clarity as to what a historical conversion covered and allowed the builder to do.

1252
01:59:12,857 --> 01:59:22,480
[SPEAKER_45]: It further was acerbated by the fact that I'm now saying we now have the new zoning regulations coming in and I'm wondering who will be the final arbiter.

1253
01:59:22,500 --> 01:59:23,820
[SPEAKER_45]: Will it be the zoning board?

1254
01:59:23,940 --> 01:59:25,381
[SPEAKER_45]: Will it be the historical commission?

1255
01:59:25,441 --> 01:59:27,381
[SPEAKER_45]: Will it be the historical district commission?

1256
01:59:27,461 --> 01:59:40,565
[SPEAKER_45]: So I would hope that a little bit of detail is time is spent to spell out in quite a bit of detail what is going to be the parameters for not change the look of the primary property

1257
01:59:41,527 --> 01:59:49,105
[SPEAKER_45]: And if an ADU is added, what specifications does that have to look like to not change the look of the property?

1258
01:59:49,285 --> 01:59:49,606
[SPEAKER_45]: Thank you.

1259
01:59:56,485 --> 01:59:57,246
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you for your question.

1260
01:59:57,286 --> 02:00:01,069
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm going to pass it over to Alicia for a response to that.

1261
02:00:01,489 --> 02:00:08,434
[SPEAKER_32]: If I understand that correctly, the question was who would be the final arbiter for a building that was in the historic district?

1262
02:00:08,974 --> 02:00:11,797
[SPEAKER_32]: And actually, I also got that separately via email today.

1263
02:00:12,237 --> 02:00:16,020
[SPEAKER_32]: So historic districts are overseen by our historic district commission.

1264
02:00:16,660 --> 02:00:22,783
[SPEAKER_32]: And you cannot do an external change to those buildings without approval by the Historic District Commission.

1265
02:00:23,323 --> 02:00:30,186
[SPEAKER_32]: And this zoning would not change that regardless of what the zoning would be at that location.

1266
02:00:30,206 --> 02:00:37,349
[SPEAKER_32]: So the Historic District Commission still has the authority in the historic districts, of which we currently have three.

1267
02:00:41,124 --> 02:00:47,765
[SPEAKER_37]: I think there's a broader question about historic conversions that I think maybe I misunderstood.

1268
02:00:49,986 --> 02:00:56,127
[SPEAKER_37]: But in the documentation, a historic conversion, the only criteria is a building older than 70 years old.

1269
02:00:56,227 --> 02:00:56,827
[SPEAKER_37]: Is that right?

1270
02:00:56,887 --> 02:00:59,227
[SPEAKER_37]: Can we just confirm that?

1271
02:00:59,327 --> 02:01:06,789
[SPEAKER_37]: Because I think that that's what was actually being asked is who determines whether a building is eligible for historic conversion.

1272
02:01:10,519 --> 02:01:20,424
[SPEAKER_32]: In that case, the answer is that the building commissioner and our records of the property would state whether or not the building was of the right age.

1273
02:01:20,484 --> 02:01:23,205
[SPEAKER_32]: And we will clarify whether it's 70 or 75 years.

1274
02:01:23,825 --> 02:01:27,187
[SPEAKER_32]: And honestly, this board can make a recommendation to the city council

1275
02:01:27,907 --> 02:01:28,707
[SPEAKER_32]: we're going to look at.

1276
02:01:28,727 --> 02:01:30,168
[SPEAKER_32]: How many how old you feel it should be.

1277
02:01:31,148 --> 02:01:34,129
[SPEAKER_32]: We'll look at what our historic commission regulations say.

1278
02:01:34,529 --> 02:01:38,471
[SPEAKER_32]: Those have also changed in the last few years because I think it should be in line with them.

1279
02:01:39,651 --> 02:01:43,052
[SPEAKER_32]: And then it would be the building commissioner and some of what we're sorry.

1280
02:01:43,072 --> 02:01:43,712
[SPEAKER_32]: There's a little weird

1281
02:01:48,554 --> 02:01:49,014
[SPEAKER_32]: maybe not.

1282
02:01:49,895 --> 02:02:01,584
[SPEAKER_32]: So we'll have to look at what the exterior of the recommended language right now is that you could only make changes to the exterior such that you could comply with building code.

1283
02:02:02,504 --> 02:02:12,292
[SPEAKER_32]: So because units have to have a separate exit and entrance, but we may need to have some conversation about exactly what we want the zoning to say along those lines.

1284
02:02:15,974 --> 02:02:16,555
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you, Alicia.

1285
02:02:18,794 --> 02:02:23,044
[SPEAKER_42]: The next zoom commenter that we have is John Pritchett.

1286
02:02:25,283 --> 02:02:27,765
[SPEAKER_54]: Hi, John Prusch, 9 Lambert Street.

1287
02:02:28,085 --> 02:02:31,467
[SPEAKER_54]: I just wanted to comment that I'm glad our city is finally doing this.

1288
02:02:32,708 --> 02:02:37,852
[SPEAKER_54]: I'm really happy to see tonight also that you've added the four-story incentive to the UR zoning.

1289
02:02:38,012 --> 02:02:40,053
[SPEAKER_54]: I know a lot of people were asking for that.

1290
02:02:41,234 --> 02:02:43,596
[SPEAKER_54]: I think this zoning reform is long overdue.

1291
02:02:43,856 --> 02:02:52,482
[SPEAKER_54]: I support the new changes, and I'm very hopeful that it will be going before the City Council for a vote soon without too much further delay.

1292
02:02:55,020 --> 02:03:06,750
[SPEAKER_54]: I understand that there are certain streets that need to be zoned for NR1 just because of the topography, but I would encourage us to limit NR1 to the streets where it's absolutely necessary.

1293
02:03:07,590 --> 02:03:17,058
[SPEAKER_54]: We do have an extreme housing crisis in our city and the region, and I really want this zoning to reflect a serious attempt to move forward as a city where, you know, people

1294
02:03:17,778 --> 02:03:26,501
[SPEAKER_54]: who are growing up here and our municipal workforce have options to stay and raise their families.

1295
02:03:26,961 --> 02:03:27,321
[SPEAKER_54]: Thank you.

1296
02:03:31,923 --> 02:03:32,423
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you, John.

1297
02:03:34,184 --> 02:03:37,505
[SPEAKER_42]: The next Zoom commenter that we have is Libby Brown.

1298
02:03:39,728 --> 02:03:45,674
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, my name is Libby Brown, I live at 1 Usher Road, a couple blocks from West Medford Square.

1299
02:03:45,694 --> 02:03:50,479
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'm in an area proposed for increased density, I think it's urban residential 2.

1300
02:03:51,800 --> 02:03:55,984
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm in full support of these proposed changes, and one of the main reasons is because

1301
02:03:56,865 --> 02:04:04,495
[SPEAKER_20]: I hear a lot of complaints from friends and neighbors about empty storefronts in West Medford along High Street, and I share that complaint.

1302
02:04:04,875 --> 02:04:08,600
[SPEAKER_20]: It's frustrating when a lot of the spaces, some have been vacant for more than five years.

1303
02:04:09,321 --> 02:04:14,948
[SPEAKER_20]: But I know that one of the most important things we need for a thriving square full of successful businesses is a critical mass.

1304
02:04:15,648 --> 02:04:23,095
[SPEAKER_20]: of people who live nearby within a couple blocks, who run their errands on foot, walking down High Street patronizing shops and restaurants.

1305
02:04:23,175 --> 02:04:39,349
[SPEAKER_20]: So with more people living in close proximity, we know there will be more people to support locally owned businesses and hopefully encourage landlords to invest in their properties to make them more leaseable, so they'll actually make more money with tenants than with crumbling vacant space that they use as a

1306
02:04:39,909 --> 02:04:40,969
[SPEAKER_20]: they're not going to be able to do that.

1307
02:04:40,989 --> 02:04:42,050
[SPEAKER_20]: They're not going to be able to do that.

1308
02:04:42,070 --> 02:04:42,990
[SPEAKER_20]: They're not going to be able to do that.

1309
02:04:43,010 --> 02:04:43,810
[SPEAKER_20]: They're not going to be able to do that.

1310
02:04:43,830 --> 02:04:44,650
[SPEAKER_20]: They're not going to be able to do that.

1311
02:04:44,670 --> 02:04:45,470
[SPEAKER_20]: They're not going to be able to do that.

1312
02:04:45,490 --> 02:04:46,291
[SPEAKER_20]: They're not going to be able to do that.

1313
02:04:46,311 --> 02:04:47,651
[SPEAKER_20]: They're not going to be able to do that.

1314
02:04:47,671 --> 02:04:48,591
[SPEAKER_20]: They're not going to be able to do that.

1315
02:04:48,611 --> 02:04:49,411
[SPEAKER_20]: They're not going to be able to do that.

1316
02:04:49,431 --> 02:04:50,632
[SPEAKER_20]: They're not going to be able to do that.

1317
02:04:50,652 --> 02:04:51,512
[SPEAKER_20]: They're not going to be able to do that.

1318
02:04:51,532 --> 02:04:52,412
[SPEAKER_20]: They're not going to be able to do that.

1319
02:04:52,432 --> 02:04:53,372
[SPEAKER_20]: They're not going to be able to do that.

1320
02:04:53,392 --> 02:04:56,493
[SPEAKER_20]: They're not going to be able to do that.

1321
02:04:56,513 --> 02:04:58,293
[SPEAKER_43]: They're not going to be able to do that.

1322
02:04:58,393 --> 02:05:02,534
They're not going to be able to do that.

1323
02:05:02,554 --> 02:05:03,334
[SPEAKER_42]: They're not going to be able to do that.

1324
02:05:03,354 --> 02:05:04,175
[SPEAKER_42]: They're not going to be able to do that.

1325
02:05:04,195 --> 02:05:04,995
[SPEAKER_42]: They're not going to be able to do that.

1326
02:05:05,015 --> 02:05:05,655
[SPEAKER_42]: They're not going

1327
02:05:09,645 --> 02:05:10,325
[SPEAKER_43]: Hello, can you hear me?

1328
02:05:11,305 --> 02:05:12,226
[SPEAKER_43]: Yes, thanks, Courtney.

1329
02:05:12,766 --> 02:05:13,046
[SPEAKER_51]: Hi.

1330
02:05:13,986 --> 02:05:15,066
[SPEAKER_51]: My name is Courtney Botello.

1331
02:05:15,106 --> 02:05:16,847
[SPEAKER_51]: I live at 49 Edward Street.

1332
02:05:18,007 --> 02:05:24,949
[SPEAKER_51]: I would say that the proposed zoning in my area is a little bit too conservative, especially with regards to lot size.

1333
02:05:25,709 --> 02:05:33,251
[SPEAKER_51]: I currently live in a non-conforming building, and everything from Layden Street to Sanger Street is currently non-conforming.

1334
02:05:34,211 --> 02:05:36,672
[SPEAKER_51]: I really like my neighborhood and would like more density.

1335
02:05:37,972 --> 02:05:46,299
[SPEAKER_51]: The two and three-story nonconforming buildings are the character of my neighborhood, and I think that new three-unit buildings should be able to be built at the minimum.

1336
02:05:47,459 --> 02:05:55,726
[SPEAKER_51]: It feels kind of silly that my building couldn't be torn down and rebuilt as is or as is with less parking and or low-impact development modifications.

1337
02:05:56,466 --> 02:06:00,611
[SPEAKER_51]: through the revised zoning code, especially when we don't have enough housing in the area.

1338
02:06:01,652 --> 02:06:07,438
[SPEAKER_51]: Personally, I chose to move here three years ago because I want to live in the city and live close to transit, which I do.

1339
02:06:09,777 --> 02:06:16,259
[SPEAKER_51]: I won't speak for all my neighbors, but I know my roommate and my good friend who live nearby both moved here for the same reasons.

1340
02:06:17,120 --> 02:06:33,786
[SPEAKER_51]: At other meetings, I've heard that we should add density in places that are already dense, which I personally feel has been directed at neighborhoods like my own, and I'm down for that, and encourage people in other neighborhoods to, you know, encourage density in that same way.

1341
02:06:34,806 --> 02:06:35,286
[SPEAKER_51]: So, thank you.

1342
02:06:35,787 --> 02:06:36,827
[SPEAKER_51]: And thank you for all your efforts.

1343
02:06:36,867 --> 02:06:39,128
[SPEAKER_51]: I know this has been a long process, and I really appreciate it.

1344
02:06:41,057 --> 02:06:45,959
[SPEAKER_42]: The gratitude is mutual to you and to everybody that is here virtually or in person.

1345
02:06:46,960 --> 02:06:49,721
[SPEAKER_42]: We're gonna go back to our in-person commenters.

1346
02:06:49,741 --> 02:06:54,643
[SPEAKER_42]: So we have Elise Jennings, Anne Haggerty and Tom Lincoln.

1347
02:06:54,663 --> 02:06:54,703
[SPEAKER_42]: Hi.

1348
02:07:00,826 --> 02:07:02,506
[SPEAKER_41]: Okay.

1349
02:07:07,587 --> 02:07:08,288
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm Anne Haggerty.

1350
02:07:08,348 --> 02:07:11,110
[SPEAKER_24]: I live at 11 Sagamore Park in West Medford.

1351
02:07:11,150 --> 02:07:13,032
[SPEAKER_24]: Hard to believe I've owned the house for 29 years.

1352
02:07:13,112 --> 02:07:19,617
[SPEAKER_24]: I want to thank the board and everybody who's been involved in evaluating things.

1353
02:07:20,838 --> 02:07:22,580
[SPEAKER_24]: I know it's been a lot of work.

1354
02:07:24,461 --> 02:07:28,625
[SPEAKER_24]: I do think there's been a little... Do you mind standing a little bit closer to the mic?

1355
02:07:28,645 --> 02:07:28,845
[SPEAKER_24]: Sure.

1356
02:07:28,865 --> 02:07:29,846
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you so much.

1357
02:07:31,192 --> 02:07:38,619
[SPEAKER_24]: I would ask that you consider extending the residential portion, the decisions on it, for a bit.

1358
02:07:38,859 --> 02:07:46,847
[SPEAKER_24]: Because I don't think a lot of people in the West Medford area were made aware of it until a week ago or two weeks ago.

1359
02:07:47,087 --> 02:07:52,573
[SPEAKER_24]: And it takes a lot of time to absorb what's being proposed and how it's going to impact

1360
02:07:53,293 --> 02:08:00,737
[SPEAKER_24]: I've spent a lot of time, I know you guys have seen me at several of the meetings, and I still don't completely understand all of the potential changes.

1361
02:08:01,838 --> 02:08:10,283
[SPEAKER_24]: For example, there's a block that's kind of divided by High Street, Grove Street, Sagamore Park, and Sagamore Ave.

1362
02:08:11,243 --> 02:08:21,690
[SPEAKER_24]: And I took a look at that great interactive map that you guys have, and there's 21 single-family houses and one multi-larger building.

1363
02:08:22,670 --> 02:08:32,449
[SPEAKER_24]: So checking out the frontage and all of the dynamics that would allow or build out, it could grow to 63, and that's not including ADUs.

1364
02:08:35,014 --> 02:08:41,077
[SPEAKER_24]: That's if we're talking about reducing parking minimums, there's no parking on Grove Street.

1365
02:08:42,538 --> 02:08:49,481
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a big impact on the community, and I'd love to understand how that would affect the rest of the neighborhood.

1366
02:08:50,021 --> 02:08:53,183
[SPEAKER_24]: The commuter rail doesn't qualify as a high frequency.

1367
02:08:53,943 --> 02:09:01,189
[SPEAKER_24]: rail, because as my understanding, the definition of that is three stops per hour during the rush hour periods, and it's only two per hour.

1368
02:09:01,769 --> 02:09:12,578
[SPEAKER_24]: So that commuter rail is great for the folks who can take advantage of it, but I work in Framingham, so it would probably take me three hours if I went that way.

1369
02:09:15,240 --> 02:09:16,922
[SPEAKER_24]: And lastly, my own.

1370
02:09:17,202 --> 02:09:21,768
[SPEAKER_24]: I probably won't have time to say that's okay I didn't give you a warning so just 20 more seconds.

1371
02:09:22,088 --> 02:09:29,837
[SPEAKER_24]: My last thing is my house is on an 8400 square foot lot with only 67 feet of foot frontage so it couldn't be divided.

1372
02:09:30,878 --> 02:09:31,999
[SPEAKER_24]: by the frontage requirements.

1373
02:09:33,119 --> 02:09:41,223
[SPEAKER_24]: It's 1,688 square feet of livable space, so it could only be one unit by the definition of the historic conversion.

1374
02:09:41,883 --> 02:09:43,564
[SPEAKER_24]: So a developer is going to go in and buy it.

1375
02:09:43,584 --> 02:09:45,245
[SPEAKER_24]: They'll overbid.

1376
02:09:45,285 --> 02:09:45,745
[SPEAKER_24]: They'll buy it.

1377
02:09:45,785 --> 02:09:46,565
[SPEAKER_24]: They'll tear it down.

1378
02:09:47,025 --> 02:09:48,406
[SPEAKER_24]: They'll put 60% of the lot

1379
02:09:50,347 --> 02:10:00,596
[SPEAKER_24]: could be 5,040 square feet of house, three levels, maybe four, each 1,680 square feet for each unit.

1380
02:10:00,917 --> 02:10:04,340
[SPEAKER_24]: That's like three of my current homes on that one lot.

1381
02:10:04,360 --> 02:10:05,461
[SPEAKER_42]: Would you mind wrapping up your comment?

1382
02:10:05,481 --> 02:10:05,581
[SPEAKER_42]: Yep.

1383
02:10:05,981 --> 02:10:06,462
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you so much.

1384
02:10:06,482 --> 02:10:11,566
[SPEAKER_24]: So I just wanted to make that point, because the dynamics are potentially huge.

1385
02:10:12,127 --> 02:10:12,788
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1386
02:10:21,010 --> 02:10:22,091
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Tom Lincoln.

1387
02:10:22,111 --> 02:10:30,359
[SPEAKER_09]: I live at 27 Gleason Street, and I qualify as an historic object here in Medford for conversion to something, maybe dinner.

1388
02:10:31,179 --> 02:10:31,440
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1389
02:10:32,541 --> 02:10:35,743
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm generally in favor, as I've said before, of this proposal.

1390
02:10:35,783 --> 02:10:37,425
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the devil is in the details.

1391
02:10:38,966 --> 02:10:43,390
[SPEAKER_09]: In thinking about it some more, I've become very concerned about trees.

1392
02:10:43,931 --> 02:10:44,511
[SPEAKER_09]: Medford has

1393
02:10:45,312 --> 02:10:50,057
[SPEAKER_09]: How shall we say, charitably a spotty record on preservation of the tree canopy.

1394
02:10:51,659 --> 02:10:58,106
[SPEAKER_09]: And in my neighborhood on Gleason Street, there are lots of large trees in people's backyards.

1395
02:10:58,967 --> 02:11:03,052
[SPEAKER_09]: And I worry about that, even though I probably won't be here.

1396
02:11:04,373 --> 02:11:12,740
[SPEAKER_09]: The other thing I think people might want to think about a little bit is that in West Medford, the commercial area is definitely underdeveloped.

1397
02:11:13,120 --> 02:11:20,306
[SPEAKER_09]: There are vacant storefronts, there are one-story, strips of one-story stores on High Street.

1398
02:11:21,207 --> 02:11:31,015
[SPEAKER_09]: There may not be a high-speed rail, et cetera, or high frequency, but there's certainly room for a lot more density there, and I think it would help all around.

1399
02:11:31,575 --> 02:11:38,540
[SPEAKER_09]: And the other thing that comes to mind is that we just, I think, barely passed an override last November.

1400
02:11:40,081 --> 02:11:47,866
[SPEAKER_09]: It's clear to me that our tax base is maxed out, and there's a social good there also.

1401
02:11:48,126 --> 02:11:54,310
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think, frankly, this comes down to some of a social equity question.

1402
02:11:54,711 --> 02:12:00,475
[SPEAKER_09]: The housing shortage not only affects people trying to move here, but affects the children of people who have lived here.

1403
02:12:01,095 --> 02:12:03,616
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not a Medford native, all their lives.

1404
02:12:03,676 --> 02:12:16,903
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that with some judicious tweaking and careful monitoring, which is a concern, I think this could work for the benefit of the community.

1405
02:12:19,444 --> 02:12:20,545
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you, Tom.

1406
02:12:23,767 --> 02:12:30,050
[SPEAKER_42]: So before we switch back to Zoom, I just wanna make a call again for Mary Louise O'Brien or Elise Jennings.

1407
02:12:31,872 --> 02:12:32,913
[SPEAKER_42]: All right, we're gonna go back to Zoom.

1408
02:12:34,395 --> 02:12:43,825
[SPEAKER_42]: Our next in-person commenters that are on deck are Josh Eckert-Lee, Nola Sundquist, and Erika DeRoche.

1409
02:12:44,666 --> 02:12:46,948
[SPEAKER_42]: You don't have to stand up now, but just, you're on deck.

1410
02:12:47,609 --> 02:12:51,673
[SPEAKER_42]: Our first Zoom commenter is Michael von Korf.

1411
02:12:53,742 --> 02:12:57,803
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, I'm Michael von Korp for Pitcher Ave, West Medford.

1412
02:12:58,484 --> 02:13:06,246
[SPEAKER_08]: I strongly support the new zoning plan for all the reasons others have mentioned, really, especially because it sets Medford up for the future.

1413
02:13:06,266 --> 02:13:09,287
[SPEAKER_08]: I want my kids to be able to afford to live here.

1414
02:13:09,307 --> 02:13:13,448
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate the incredible thoroughness of the process.

1415
02:13:13,849 --> 02:13:16,549
[SPEAKER_08]: And at the same time, I hope it speeds up a little.

1416
02:13:17,250 --> 02:13:19,390
[SPEAKER_08]: This process has been in motion for years.

1417
02:13:21,411 --> 02:13:21,871
[SPEAKER_08]: goes through.

1418
02:13:21,931 --> 02:13:24,813
[SPEAKER_08]: It may take decades to come into full effect.

1419
02:13:26,134 --> 02:13:29,836
[SPEAKER_08]: Meanwhile, we have a massive housing shortage that's only growing over time.

1420
02:13:31,036 --> 02:13:34,178
[SPEAKER_08]: So in the spirit of that request for thoughtful speed, I'll stop there.

1421
02:13:34,458 --> 02:13:34,798
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1422
02:13:38,540 --> 02:13:39,021
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you, Michael.

1423
02:13:39,041 --> 02:13:41,422
[SPEAKER_42]: I appreciate your brevity as well as your direct messages.

1424
02:13:41,442 --> 02:13:45,904
[SPEAKER_42]: Our next Zoom commenter is Jennifer Guerin.

1425
02:13:47,585 --> 02:13:48,006
[SPEAKER_42]: Hi, folks.

1426
02:13:48,026 --> 02:13:48,726
[SPEAKER_42]: Can you hear me okay?

1427
02:13:49,790 --> 02:13:50,010
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes.

1428
02:13:50,070 --> 02:13:50,770
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you, Jennifer.

1429
02:13:51,391 --> 02:13:51,771
[SPEAKER_29]: Excellent.

1430
02:13:51,811 --> 02:13:52,051
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay.

1431
02:13:52,071 --> 02:13:57,433
[SPEAKER_29]: So hi, my name is Jennifer Guerin and I own a two family home on Cooley Road in West Medford.

1432
02:13:57,893 --> 02:14:03,215
[SPEAKER_29]: And I want to start by saying that I fully support the revitalization efforts of West Medford Square.

1433
02:14:03,235 --> 02:14:11,518
[SPEAKER_29]: And I appreciate that we need more housing in the city, but I strongly oppose the densification that's being proposed under this plan.

1434
02:14:12,368 --> 02:14:20,733
[SPEAKER_29]: Rezoning neighborhoods that consist of single family and two family homes to urban residential one is just too much too fast.

1435
02:14:21,333 --> 02:14:27,917
[SPEAKER_29]: And it would be more appropriate to consider, you know, the R excuse me, the NR3 zoning at this time, but not you are one.

1436
02:14:27,937 --> 02:14:33,821
[SPEAKER_29]: I think we really need to consider the impacts to our infrastructure, like our roads, utilities, mirror.

1437
02:14:34,261 --> 02:14:37,803
[SPEAKER_29]: We also need to consider the extra burden to our fire and police departments.

1438
02:14:37,943 --> 02:14:40,885
[SPEAKER_29]: And of course the impact to our schools, which are already crowded.

1439
02:14:41,703 --> 02:14:45,886
[SPEAKER_29]: In addition, I think everybody who lives in the neighborhood knows that traffic is already terrible.

1440
02:14:46,266 --> 02:14:50,628
[SPEAKER_29]: During the morning rush hour can take 20 minutes to get past the rotary on High Street and 38.

1441
02:14:51,829 --> 02:15:02,916
[SPEAKER_29]: And for the folks who take the commuter rail, we know that the commuter rail is frequently delayed and that when trains finally do arrive, especially during the morning commute, they're already packed and it's standing room only to North Station.

1442
02:15:03,376 --> 02:15:08,399
[SPEAKER_29]: So we really should look into fixing the MBTA before we consider adding more residents to the neighborhood.

1443
02:15:09,133 --> 02:15:20,722
[SPEAKER_29]: And importantly, this proposal does nothing to address affordability, but it does ensure that developers and real estate agents will profit from the sale of more million dollar plus condos in our neighborhoods.

1444
02:15:21,523 --> 02:15:22,644
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you for your consideration.

1445
02:15:22,664 --> 02:15:26,326
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you, Jennifer.

1446
02:15:29,589 --> 02:15:31,871
[SPEAKER_42]: Our next Zoom commenter is Irene Rose.

1447
02:15:34,893 --> 02:15:35,674
[SPEAKER_42]: Hi, can you hear me?

1448
02:15:36,648 --> 02:15:37,169
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, we can.

1449
02:15:37,209 --> 02:15:37,789
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Irene.

1450
02:15:38,390 --> 02:15:39,711
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you so much.

1451
02:15:39,831 --> 02:15:43,515
[SPEAKER_21]: First, I just want to say how grateful I am for this process.

1452
02:15:43,535 --> 02:15:46,798
[SPEAKER_21]: I live at 76 Sharon Street in West Medford.

1453
02:15:46,818 --> 02:15:51,443
[SPEAKER_21]: I just really want to say I really appreciate the amount of communications you all have done.

1454
02:15:52,203 --> 02:15:58,625
[SPEAKER_21]: I've been following this process and I see so much about it on Facebook and on Reddit and on Nextdoor.

1455
02:15:58,925 --> 02:16:03,166
[SPEAKER_21]: I think there's just a lot of information you all put out and I really appreciate that.

1456
02:16:03,706 --> 02:16:08,727
[SPEAKER_21]: I just want to share my huge support for this proposal.

1457
02:16:09,187 --> 02:16:19,270
[SPEAKER_21]: I own a single family home and I'm really truly excited about providing opportunities to other people to move to this area, especially other young people like myself.

1458
02:16:20,131 --> 02:16:27,398
[SPEAKER_21]: I just want to see a vibrant and alive city, and I'm really excited about her getting higher tax revenue.

1459
02:16:27,758 --> 02:16:36,928
[SPEAKER_21]: When we talk about all the services that currently are perhaps understaffed and not functioning well it's truly because we do not have enough tax revenue.

1460
02:16:37,488 --> 02:16:44,235
[SPEAKER_21]: And to have higher density will allow us to have more businesses, which will allow us to collect more taxes and thus improve on those services.

1461
02:16:44,536 --> 02:16:50,362
[SPEAKER_21]: So I truly just don't see a way for us to actually address some of these other concerns, which I definitely agree with.

1462
02:16:50,422 --> 02:16:51,783
[SPEAKER_21]: I would love to have, you know,

1463
02:16:52,904 --> 02:16:57,426
[SPEAKER_21]: roads that are in better shape and so on, but I just understand that the city really needs more revenue.

1464
02:16:57,486 --> 02:17:03,068
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm really excited about the opportunity to add more folks to this amazing city.

1465
02:17:03,088 --> 02:17:11,991
[SPEAKER_21]: And, you know, I just want to point to all of our neighbors a little south of us who have higher density and have really vibrant communities and thriving businesses.

1466
02:17:12,691 --> 02:17:17,033
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think that it's really just going to really set up Medford to be successful in the future.

1467
02:17:17,093 --> 02:17:21,215
[SPEAKER_21]: So just thank you so much to the consultants and the council

1468
02:17:22,698 --> 02:17:23,979
[SPEAKER_21]: and everyone else involved in the process.

1469
02:17:24,059 --> 02:17:24,779
[SPEAKER_21]: I really appreciate it.

1470
02:17:27,901 --> 02:17:28,522
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you, Irene.

1471
02:17:28,942 --> 02:17:30,243
[SPEAKER_42]: The gratitude is mutual.

1472
02:17:31,304 --> 02:17:34,306
[SPEAKER_42]: We're going to move back to our in-person commenters.

1473
02:17:36,067 --> 02:17:39,569
[SPEAKER_42]: So that's Josh.

1474
02:17:41,330 --> 02:17:41,670
[SPEAKER_42]: Sorry.

1475
02:17:41,911 --> 02:17:44,432
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm sorry for anyone that triggered if that's your wake-up alarm.

1476
02:17:50,860 --> 02:17:51,120
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

1477
02:17:51,140 --> 02:17:52,441
[SPEAKER_42]: Josh and I was it.

1478
02:17:52,761 --> 02:17:54,562
[SPEAKER_42]: You know, less sound quest.

1479
02:17:54,922 --> 02:17:55,203
[SPEAKER_42]: Awesome.

1480
02:17:55,263 --> 02:17:55,663
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

1481
02:17:56,223 --> 02:17:57,224
[SPEAKER_42]: Um and Erica De Roche.

1482
02:17:58,104 --> 02:17:58,325
[SPEAKER_42]: Hi.

1483
02:17:58,945 --> 02:17:59,105
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi.

1484
02:17:59,325 --> 02:17:59,525
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks.

1485
02:17:59,825 --> 02:18:00,526
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm Josh Eckert.

1486
02:18:00,546 --> 02:18:00,746
[SPEAKER_12]: Lee.

1487
02:18:01,046 --> 02:18:06,369
[SPEAKER_12]: I live at 3 47 Main Street firmly in favor of this rezoning effort.

1488
02:18:06,489 --> 02:18:09,992
[SPEAKER_12]: Really grateful for your work, Alicia and her team's work.

1489
02:18:10,152 --> 02:18:14,014
[SPEAKER_12]: Obviously, Emily and us and Paula, you guys really excellent and I've explained this really well.

1490
02:18:14,054 --> 02:18:14,815
[SPEAKER_12]: I think you've come to

1491
02:18:15,695 --> 02:18:20,378
[SPEAKER_12]: a lot of compromises to deal with the obviously diverging opinions here.

1492
02:18:20,559 --> 02:18:30,426
[SPEAKER_12]: I work professionally as a municipal planner, so I really empathize with the work you're doing and the fact that I can leave after I make this comment and you'll have to stick around for a long while.

1493
02:18:31,847 --> 02:18:35,230
[SPEAKER_12]: I really encourage you to move forward on this quickly.

1494
02:18:36,391 --> 02:18:53,566
[SPEAKER_12]: The fact that there are 250 people have been on the Zoom at some points this evening really is a testimony to how much outreach you've done in addition to the various previous meetings and our ability as residents to talk to our neighbors and talk to folks in our neighborhood to encourage them to speak out and be.

1495
02:18:54,407 --> 02:19:00,828
[SPEAKER_12]: at least for my benefit, as a renter, as a young person, be in favor of increasing the density so that I can stay here.

1496
02:19:00,968 --> 02:19:01,788
[SPEAKER_12]: I had to move.

1497
02:19:02,308 --> 02:19:05,129
[SPEAKER_12]: Every year I've lived in the Boston area because rents are too expensive.

1498
02:19:05,209 --> 02:19:08,230
[SPEAKER_12]: And I live with my wife, with two other residents.

1499
02:19:10,530 --> 02:19:11,210
[SPEAKER_12]: It's expensive.

1500
02:19:11,250 --> 02:19:14,171
[SPEAKER_12]: There's nine secondary degrees between the four of us.

1501
02:19:14,451 --> 02:19:17,751
[SPEAKER_12]: And we still will be lucky to be able to continue to rent here.

1502
02:19:17,811 --> 02:19:19,912
[SPEAKER_12]: So this lays

1503
02:19:21,586 --> 02:19:30,080
[SPEAKER_12]: gentle and conservative groundwork so that the actual work of dealing with this housing crisis and creating new housing can begin.

1504
02:19:30,140 --> 02:19:33,966
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is minimal, this is easy, this is necessary and morally imperative.

1505
02:19:34,006 --> 02:19:35,469
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you and good night.

1506
02:19:37,712 --> 02:19:38,373
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you, Josh.

1507
02:19:40,074 --> 02:19:46,138
[SPEAKER_42]: And as someone whose rent is going up almost $400 this year, I definitely empathize with that.

1508
02:19:46,158 --> 02:19:47,299
[SPEAKER_42]: And yes, I am a renter.

1509
02:19:49,321 --> 02:19:50,161
[SPEAKER_13]: Our next speaker, hi.

1510
02:19:50,402 --> 02:19:53,804
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, my name is Nola Sundquist and I live on Main Street in Medford.

1511
02:19:54,865 --> 02:19:57,307
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm strongly in favor of the proposed zoning changes.

1512
02:19:57,327 --> 02:20:01,330
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm both a resident of Medford and I'm also a resident physician.

1513
02:20:01,350 --> 02:20:05,073
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I speak not only for myself, but also for the communities that I've served.

1514
02:20:06,838 --> 02:20:13,480
[SPEAKER_13]: throughout medical school, and when I say that the housing crisis is not only a home crisis, but also a public health crisis.

1515
02:20:15,541 --> 02:20:21,703
[SPEAKER_13]: I speak for the mom who had to sleep in her car in a parking lot before work to beat the traffic coming into Boston.

1516
02:20:21,723 --> 02:20:25,484
[SPEAKER_13]: I speak for my pregnant patient who didn't know where she could live with her baby.

1517
02:20:26,205 --> 02:20:36,108
[SPEAKER_13]: But I also speak for the woman who was able to keep her mom in her housing, or keep her mom out of the hospital because she was able to stay in her house in a multi-generational, multifamily home.

1518
02:20:37,335 --> 02:20:40,257
[SPEAKER_13]: I speak for the woman who brings her elderly neighbor to the hospital.

1519
02:20:42,800 --> 02:20:50,526
[SPEAKER_13]: I speak for many people who also who I haven't met because they've not been able to be part of our community because there is not enough housing here.

1520
02:20:52,227 --> 02:20:53,448
[SPEAKER_13]: We need housing and we need neighbors.

1521
02:20:54,609 --> 02:21:03,837
[SPEAKER_13]: The change would not take away from the property values of the properties we already own and live in, but rather it would allow more people to experience this vibrant city.

1522
02:21:04,758 --> 02:21:05,018
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1523
02:21:06,947 --> 02:21:07,347
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

1524
02:21:07,547 --> 02:21:11,688
[SPEAKER_46]: Hi.

1525
02:21:13,129 --> 02:21:13,369
[SPEAKER_46]: Hi.

1526
02:21:13,429 --> 02:21:13,989
[SPEAKER_46]: Good evening.

1527
02:21:14,229 --> 02:21:16,370
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you, Madam Chair and rest of the board.

1528
02:21:16,690 --> 02:21:17,870
[SPEAKER_46]: My name is Erica Deroche.

1529
02:21:17,910 --> 02:21:19,551
[SPEAKER_46]: I live at 260 Willis Ave.

1530
02:21:20,991 --> 02:21:25,313
[SPEAKER_46]: I thank you for taking and reading my comments previous to this evening as well.

1531
02:21:25,473 --> 02:21:27,593
[SPEAKER_46]: And so I'm just going to dive into some

1532
02:21:29,995 --> 02:21:45,112
[SPEAKER_46]: My position here is that I am strongly in favor of the new proposed residential districts presented on May 21st and I would urge the board to recommend approval with some changes to use in dimensional tables.

1533
02:21:46,353 --> 02:21:52,375
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm very lucky that my neighborhood South Medford is already a walkable transit connected neighborhood.

1534
02:21:52,935 --> 02:21:54,596
[SPEAKER_46]: However, in the rest of the city.

1535
02:21:55,096 --> 02:22:02,359
[SPEAKER_46]: It's important to zone with the certainty that improved transit will be coming to all areas of the city in the future.

1536
02:22:02,919 --> 02:22:05,760
[SPEAKER_46]: We know it can and it will take a long time.

1537
02:22:06,840 --> 02:22:11,321
[SPEAKER_46]: As someone who has been waiting for 18 years, I know that, personally.

1538
02:22:12,721 --> 02:22:24,784
[SPEAKER_46]: But it's incumbent upon us to advocate for and demand the transportation that serves us as a community, and what is lacking in the city now should not limit the development that we know is needed to address the housing crisis.

1539
02:22:25,424 --> 02:22:36,287
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm in favor of the NR1 and NR2 districts to be up to three units in addition to ADUs, and not just for historic conversion, but also for new construction.

1540
02:22:37,908 --> 02:22:46,552
[SPEAKER_46]: I take a special interest in my neighborhood, South Medford, and I take exception to some of the limitations in the use of dimensional tables.

1541
02:22:47,533 --> 02:22:52,615
[SPEAKER_46]: They need to be more permissive relative to the lot coverage, height, and density overall.

1542
02:22:52,795 --> 02:22:56,677
[SPEAKER_46]: Obviously, parking minimums also play a part in increasing density.

1543
02:22:58,218 --> 02:23:02,080
[SPEAKER_46]: And please correct me if I've misunderstood the new proposal.

1544
02:23:02,100 --> 02:23:02,740
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm sorry, 30 seconds.

1545
02:23:06,322 --> 02:23:23,349
[SPEAKER_46]: the as of right height should be increased in your one and you are to to at least four stories with high increases for inclusionary development, allowing denser development and smaller lots allows smaller developers and owner occupied homes to be redeveloped, spurring local investment.

1546
02:23:24,049 --> 02:23:27,310
[SPEAKER_46]: Um, so just to wrap up, I did hear the buzzer.

1547
02:23:27,631 --> 02:23:30,532
[SPEAKER_46]: Um, in terms of use, please also consider

1548
02:23:31,772 --> 02:23:38,956
[SPEAKER_46]: adding safe uses at the ground floor and integrating those into the neighborhood districts.

1549
02:23:40,457 --> 02:23:46,440
[SPEAKER_46]: But overall, thank you very much for the process and for hearing us over and over again.

1550
02:23:46,460 --> 02:23:48,221
[SPEAKER_46]: Have a good evening.

1551
02:23:48,721 --> 02:23:49,221
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you, Erica.

1552
02:23:49,241 --> 02:23:49,461
[SPEAKER_46]: Okay.

1553
02:24:03,291 --> 02:24:05,533
[SPEAKER_42]: So we're going to move that next one.

1554
02:24:06,134 --> 02:24:17,444
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay, so we're going to move back to zoom, but our next three in person commenters are Jennifer Lavoie and McDonald and Andrew of East Medford.

1555
02:24:18,105 --> 02:24:19,066
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you for your patience.

1556
02:24:23,931 --> 02:24:25,772
[SPEAKER_42]: So our next zoom commenter is Tara.

1557
02:24:28,519 --> 02:24:28,899
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello.

1558
02:24:29,739 --> 02:24:30,099
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi.

1559
02:24:30,119 --> 02:24:31,860
[SPEAKER_15]: Can everybody hear me okay, hopefully?

1560
02:24:32,820 --> 02:24:33,620
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, thank you.

1561
02:24:34,400 --> 02:24:34,700
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

1562
02:24:35,381 --> 02:24:36,281
[SPEAKER_15]: Tara Gearhart.

1563
02:24:36,701 --> 02:24:40,622
[SPEAKER_15]: We live in Fulton Heights area, Andrew Street.

1564
02:24:40,822 --> 02:24:48,764
[SPEAKER_15]: And as of last year, we also bought a single family home across the street that we are, it was a gut renovation.

1565
02:24:49,144 --> 02:24:53,385
[SPEAKER_15]: My husband and I both own our own businesses.

1566
02:24:53,425 --> 02:24:56,245
[SPEAKER_15]: We have been Bedford residents since 2008.

1567
02:24:59,066 --> 02:25:01,387
[SPEAKER_15]: We plan to be here for a long while.

1568
02:25:01,487 --> 02:25:04,029
[SPEAKER_15]: We have three children in the Robert school system.

1569
02:25:04,529 --> 02:25:09,111
[SPEAKER_15]: I also hold a real estate license and my husband is a general contactor.

1570
02:25:09,591 --> 02:25:16,695
[SPEAKER_15]: So we understand a lot of the information that has been proposed.

1571
02:25:17,675 --> 02:25:23,378
[SPEAKER_15]: What I am trying to reiterate is that while Medford does need

1572
02:25:23,771 --> 02:25:37,843
[SPEAKER_15]: density increased, a blanket zoning proposal that is being proposed has a lot of things that I don't think are being thought out despite the amount of research and time that a project like this takes.

1573
02:25:38,643 --> 02:25:40,985
[SPEAKER_15]: I know the hard work that has gone into it.

1574
02:25:42,307 --> 02:25:49,733
[SPEAKER_15]: I have witnessed in our school system lack of resources, overcrowded classrooms,

1575
02:25:50,693 --> 02:25:56,175
[SPEAKER_15]: inability to find subs to which the janitor is being used as a substitute teacher.

1576
02:25:56,875 --> 02:26:02,997
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think there's a lot of other issues that we need to fix that are not being in consideration.

1577
02:26:03,477 --> 02:26:10,959
[SPEAKER_15]: Traffic, infrastructure, the lead pipe issue, our house on the Andrew Street is fine.

1578
02:26:11,439 --> 02:26:12,500
[SPEAKER_15]: the other house is not.

1579
02:26:13,060 --> 02:26:21,123
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's just, I think, a lot of things that need to be considered that I'm not sure people have been thinking about.

1580
02:26:21,203 --> 02:26:22,604
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's my only comment.

1581
02:26:22,744 --> 02:26:32,528
[SPEAKER_15]: I appreciate the opportunity to speak and thank you for doing additional due diligence and not rushing this process in a blanket zoning update.

1582
02:26:34,409 --> 02:26:34,929
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you, Tara.

1583
02:26:39,107 --> 02:26:42,991
[SPEAKER_42]: Our next commenter is Stephanie Guerns-Meyer.

1584
02:26:43,011 --> 02:26:51,619
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, I'm Stephanie Guerns-Meyer, 54 Whitney Road in the Lawrence Estate.

1585
02:26:52,139 --> 02:27:03,830
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm very glad to live in this this neighborhood where my husband and I can live without a car and we can walk 15 minutes to get to West Medford, 15 minutes to Medford Square, 15 minutes to Whole Foods.

1586
02:27:05,572 --> 02:27:07,213
[SPEAKER_16]: And I applaud you all for your efforts.

1587
02:27:07,314 --> 02:27:11,778
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm a strong supporter of increasing the housing supply in Medford.

1588
02:27:12,139 --> 02:27:15,703
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't have children, but we want our neighbors' children to be able to live here.

1589
02:27:15,723 --> 02:27:21,909
[SPEAKER_16]: We want people who work in Medford to be able to live in Medford, even if they don't earn that much money.

1590
02:27:23,651 --> 02:27:32,857
[SPEAKER_16]: And actually my one bone to pick is, you know, we live in an NR1 neighborhood and I think the entire city should be duplex by right.

1591
02:27:35,279 --> 02:27:43,024
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a private way and I guess I just totally don't get why we can't have duplexes in our neighborhood too.

1592
02:27:43,044 --> 02:27:46,166
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't really see parking as an issue.

1593
02:27:47,107 --> 02:27:47,727
[SPEAKER_16]: If anything,

1594
02:27:48,815 --> 02:27:52,338
[SPEAKER_16]: cars parked in our neighborhood are a feature rather than a bug.

1595
02:27:53,438 --> 02:27:55,540
[SPEAKER_16]: They are welcome traffic calming devices.

1596
02:27:56,441 --> 02:28:07,629
[SPEAKER_16]: And in fact, since we have no cars of ours, I'm always glad when we have people parked in front of our house because that makes the traffic go a little bit slower when people are cutting through and avoiding stoplights.

1597
02:28:08,270 --> 02:28:09,711
[SPEAKER_16]: And so I guess I'll leave it at that.

1598
02:28:09,811 --> 02:28:11,512
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you very much for all of your efforts.

1599
02:28:14,774 --> 02:28:15,395
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you, Stephanie.

1600
02:28:16,270 --> 02:28:18,811
[SPEAKER_42]: Our next Zoom commenter is Ken Garrow.

1601
02:28:22,791 --> 02:28:24,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, can you hear me?

1602
02:28:25,292 --> 02:28:26,252
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes, thank you, Ken.

1603
02:28:26,952 --> 02:28:27,312
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1604
02:28:27,832 --> 02:28:29,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Ken Garrow, 52 Lambert Street.

1605
02:28:30,633 --> 02:28:32,493
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, thank you all.

1606
02:28:32,613 --> 02:28:35,274
[SPEAKER_05]: I know this has been, like you said, the fifth meeting.

1607
02:28:35,354 --> 02:28:37,714
[SPEAKER_05]: You've heard from me several times over this point.

1608
02:28:39,155 --> 02:28:41,475
[SPEAKER_05]: I am broadly supportive of this entire endeavor.

1609
02:28:41,995 --> 02:28:44,656
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it moves Medford into the right direction.

1610
02:28:46,837 --> 02:28:48,098
[SPEAKER_05]: I have my small quibbles.

1611
02:28:48,818 --> 02:28:54,502
[SPEAKER_05]: I have previously said, similar to the previous commenter, I don't think NR1 should exist.

1612
02:28:54,582 --> 02:29:00,366
[SPEAKER_05]: I think zoning something single family usage is not where we need with the housing crisis.

1613
02:29:01,226 --> 02:29:04,328
[SPEAKER_05]: I do agree that I think everything should be NR2 by right.

1614
02:29:04,588 --> 02:29:06,169
[SPEAKER_05]: We should have duplexes in the city.

1615
02:29:06,189 --> 02:29:09,811
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Fulton Heights, Lawrence Estates, those areas that are NR1.

1616
02:29:12,153 --> 02:29:17,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they already have the historical conversion of allowing two units, obviously it's okay having those two units.

1617
02:29:18,940 --> 02:29:23,164
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate Emily and Paola repeatedly talking about the private ways.

1618
02:29:23,324 --> 02:29:29,450
[SPEAKER_05]: I totally understand and appreciate them bringing that context, but I really think we can expand out what we have.

1619
02:29:31,460 --> 02:29:34,622
[SPEAKER_05]: And in general, again, I really do appreciate this.

1620
02:29:35,003 --> 02:29:36,924
[SPEAKER_05]: I really think this is the right step in the direction.

1621
02:29:38,045 --> 02:29:43,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Personally, I live in a triple-decker that was outdated by the 1980s rezoning.

1622
02:29:43,950 --> 02:29:51,576
[SPEAKER_05]: It is going to become mostly conforming by the NR3 designation.

1623
02:29:51,616 --> 02:29:53,157
[SPEAKER_05]: My lot's a little bit on the small side.

1624
02:29:54,166 --> 02:29:55,067
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love it.

1625
02:29:55,228 --> 02:29:58,351
[SPEAKER_05]: I love living over here in just along Salem Street.

1626
02:29:58,792 --> 02:29:59,833
[SPEAKER_05]: I love being in Medford.

1627
02:29:59,893 --> 02:30:01,395
[SPEAKER_05]: I have been here for 15 years.

1628
02:30:01,415 --> 02:30:07,682
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't plan on leaving anytime soon, despite I'm sure some people who I know would prefer that to be the case.

1629
02:30:11,687 --> 02:30:12,727
[SPEAKER_05]: I want us to keep growing.

1630
02:30:12,927 --> 02:30:13,928
[SPEAKER_05]: I want us to keep moving.

1631
02:30:13,948 --> 02:30:25,292
[SPEAKER_05]: I would also talk to people who might be concerned about this density as a problem to think of the fact that, you know, personally, I would rather have more density and lower taxes.

1632
02:30:26,292 --> 02:30:28,033
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank you for your time.

1633
02:30:28,053 --> 02:30:28,673
[SPEAKER_05]: You're doing great.

1634
02:30:28,793 --> 02:30:29,833
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hope this goes through.

1635
02:30:33,715 --> 02:30:34,315
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you, Ken.

1636
02:30:35,075 --> 02:30:36,115
[SPEAKER_42]: And I'm glad you're still here.

1637
02:30:37,696 --> 02:30:39,957
[SPEAKER_42]: Our next, so that was three zoom comments, wasn't it?

1638
02:30:39,997 --> 02:30:40,157
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah.

1639
02:30:40,257 --> 02:30:40,717
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay.

1640
02:30:41,663 --> 02:30:44,225
[SPEAKER_42]: So we're going to go back to our in-person commenters.

1641
02:30:44,245 --> 02:30:46,546
[SPEAKER_42]: We have Jennifer, Anne, and Andrew.

1642
02:31:02,251 --> 02:31:06,593
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay, we're going to just move past Jennifer just out of kind of respect for the rest of the people on the list.

1643
02:31:06,753 --> 02:31:08,833
[SPEAKER_42]: But I do appreciate the question.

1644
02:31:09,613 --> 02:31:11,294
[SPEAKER_42]: Our next commenter is Anne McDonald.

1645
02:31:11,314 --> 02:31:16,435
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay, and then we have Andrew of East Medford.

1646
02:31:17,295 --> 02:31:25,497
[SPEAKER_42]: And then since we have kind of two vacancies, the next two we're going to have as part of this same session are William Navar and Anita Goldberg.

1647
02:31:26,598 --> 02:31:27,498
[SPEAKER_42]: So William and Anita,

1648
02:31:29,975 --> 02:31:31,416
[SPEAKER_40]: Okay.

1649
02:31:32,137 --> 02:31:33,318
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay, I appreciate that.

1650
02:31:33,838 --> 02:31:34,699
[SPEAKER_42]: Caitlin Robinson.

1651
02:31:34,719 --> 02:31:37,901
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay, great.

1652
02:31:38,281 --> 02:31:40,143
[SPEAKER_42]: Are you ready to chat this time around?

1653
02:31:40,563 --> 02:31:40,943
[SPEAKER_42]: Great.

1654
02:31:41,224 --> 02:31:43,005
[SPEAKER_42]: So Andrew of East Medford, please.

1655
02:31:45,066 --> 02:31:45,567
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

1656
02:31:46,467 --> 02:31:47,048
[SPEAKER_48]: Who are you?

1657
02:31:52,792 --> 02:31:54,453
[SPEAKER_48]: Hi, thank you for your remembrance.

1658
02:31:54,854 --> 02:31:55,794
[SPEAKER_48]: I have returned.

1659
02:31:56,835 --> 02:31:57,476
[SPEAKER_43]: Glad to see you.

1660
02:32:00,677 --> 02:32:06,539
[SPEAKER_48]: I'm Andrew Castagnetti, and I am in East Medford, two blocks to your right.

1661
02:32:10,280 --> 02:32:13,561
[SPEAKER_48]: I'm usually for more real estate development.

1662
02:32:14,761 --> 02:32:17,902
[SPEAKER_48]: However, it must be smart development.

1663
02:32:19,722 --> 02:32:25,204
[SPEAKER_48]: At Mystic Ave is our best place for mass mixed use buildings.

1664
02:32:27,885 --> 02:32:29,305
[SPEAKER_48]: But not Salem Street.

1665
02:32:30,340 --> 02:32:36,944
[SPEAKER_48]: It already is congested and will become like Somerville with Somerville hassles.

1666
02:32:39,706 --> 02:32:41,327
[SPEAKER_48]: If you live there, it would be worse.

1667
02:32:44,349 --> 02:32:44,870
[SPEAKER_48]: I get it.

1668
02:32:45,150 --> 02:32:48,992
[SPEAKER_48]: The city wants more and more real estate tax money.

1669
02:32:49,913 --> 02:32:52,355
[SPEAKER_48]: But what fries my ass

1670
02:32:54,980 --> 02:32:58,762
[SPEAKER_48]: is our real estate tax bill will not come down at all.

1671
02:32:59,242 --> 02:32:59,622
[SPEAKER_48]: Will it?

1672
02:32:59,782 --> 02:33:00,563
[SPEAKER_48]: It's a question.

1673
02:33:01,443 --> 02:33:05,545
[SPEAKER_48]: Will the real estate tax bills come down at all or the opposite?

1674
02:33:05,745 --> 02:33:12,969
[SPEAKER_48]: They're gonna add two and a half percent onto a larger number every year for eternity.

1675
02:33:14,189 --> 02:33:15,370
[SPEAKER_48]: I'm waiting for an answer.

1676
02:33:17,051 --> 02:33:18,751
[SPEAKER_43]: I unfortunately don't have that answer.

1677
02:33:18,771 --> 02:33:19,552
[SPEAKER_48]: Thank you very much.

1678
02:33:21,333 --> 02:33:21,953
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you, Andrew.

1679
02:33:27,270 --> 02:33:28,611
[SPEAKER_43]: William, nice to see you in person.

1680
02:33:28,852 --> 02:33:29,252
[SPEAKER_52]: Hi there.

1681
02:33:29,272 --> 02:33:33,917
[SPEAKER_52]: Excuse me, William Navarre, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

1682
02:33:34,597 --> 02:33:41,824
[SPEAKER_52]: I'm ready for you to incorporate public feedback into your recommendations to City Council and pass them back to the City Council to approve them.

1683
02:33:42,985 --> 02:33:44,566
[SPEAKER_52]: There are a few improvements I would make.

1684
02:33:44,866 --> 02:33:53,308
[SPEAKER_52]: The minimum lot sizes are still relatively large in many cases, reducing that wouldn't make our lot smaller, I stress, it would just make more of them buildable.

1685
02:33:54,269 --> 02:33:56,489
[SPEAKER_52]: My building is four units 2300 square feet.

1686
02:33:58,962 --> 02:34:05,448
[SPEAKER_52]: potential for adding height is very limited in South Bedford, where many buildings are already three stories, we should be going to four and you are two by right.

1687
02:34:05,988 --> 02:34:11,373
[SPEAKER_52]: And the wide gentle slope streets of northwestern Bedford can accommodate duplexes and they should be allowed.

1688
02:34:12,214 --> 02:34:14,496
[SPEAKER_52]: If you sort that out, you should pass it be on your way.

1689
02:34:15,076 --> 02:34:17,779
[SPEAKER_52]: The idea at this point that there hasn't been enough process is ridiculous.

1690
02:34:17,859 --> 02:34:27,668
[SPEAKER_52]: I feel I've been spending the better part of the year chasing the zoning consultants all over town, public forums, Q&As, planning and permitting committee meetings, city council meetings, and the process has been exhausting, and it's been going on since January.

1691
02:34:28,109 --> 02:34:32,833
[SPEAKER_52]: I get that everybody wants the end of the process to last forever, because it's so much fun.

1692
02:34:33,873 --> 02:34:36,035
[SPEAKER_52]: But because the beginning is so boring.

1693
02:34:36,295 --> 02:34:38,537
[SPEAKER_52]: But if we start over, we're gonna be back at the boring beginning.

1694
02:34:38,957 --> 02:34:42,440
[SPEAKER_52]: And we saw how that worked out at the beginning of this meeting.

1695
02:34:42,740 --> 02:34:46,644
[SPEAKER_52]: How many more Wednesdays do we have to keep showing up just on NRUR zoning?

1696
02:34:46,924 --> 02:34:48,145
[SPEAKER_52]: This is getting out of control.

1697
02:34:48,645 --> 02:34:49,866
[SPEAKER_52]: And let's remember why we're here.

1698
02:34:50,147 --> 02:34:51,948
[SPEAKER_52]: We're trying to fix the broken status quo.

1699
02:34:52,248 --> 02:34:56,152
[SPEAKER_52]: We say we care about climate change, but pushing people further out into the sticks is not good for the climate.

1700
02:34:56,552 --> 02:35:02,675
[SPEAKER_52]: We say we care about housing affordability, but mandating that market rate housing take up more space, that's what density regulations do.

1701
02:35:02,715 --> 02:35:04,556
[SPEAKER_52]: It says if it's market rate housing, gotta do more space.

1702
02:35:05,817 --> 02:35:08,498
[SPEAKER_52]: That isn't doing anyone any favors for affordability.

1703
02:35:09,674 --> 02:35:15,541
[SPEAKER_52]: We say we care about walkability and local businesses, but preventing people living near our local businesses isn't helping.

1704
02:35:16,142 --> 02:35:24,212
[SPEAKER_52]: People talk about traffic, but if we force people further out into the suburbs and exurbs, they'll only be driving even more, and their lives will be driving through Medford anyways.

1705
02:35:24,512 --> 02:35:27,435
[SPEAKER_52]: That's what we are talking about when we say we are a cut-through town.

1706
02:35:29,114 --> 02:35:35,381
[SPEAKER_52]: Americans today are moving away from opportunity in search of cheap housing instead of towards it in search of high wages.

1707
02:35:35,922 --> 02:35:40,407
[SPEAKER_52]: We can help by building the housing here and we can because Medford isn't full.

1708
02:35:40,628 --> 02:35:41,008
[SPEAKER_52]: Thank you.

1709
02:35:41,028 --> 02:35:44,212
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you, William.

1710
02:35:46,454 --> 02:35:46,875
[SPEAKER_43]: Hi, Anita.

1711
02:35:47,947 --> 02:35:48,588
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm Caitlin.

1712
02:35:49,228 --> 02:35:50,670
[SPEAKER_42]: Oh, Caitlin Robinson.

1713
02:35:50,710 --> 02:35:50,910
[SPEAKER_42]: Oh, yes.

1714
02:35:50,970 --> 02:35:51,811
[SPEAKER_42]: And you guys not here.

1715
02:35:52,432 --> 02:35:52,852
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm sorry.

1716
02:35:53,252 --> 02:35:53,993
[SPEAKER_42]: Apologies for that.

1717
02:35:54,213 --> 02:35:54,634
[SPEAKER_26]: No problem.

1718
02:35:54,954 --> 02:35:57,777
[SPEAKER_26]: Caitlin Robinson, 31 Everett Street.

1719
02:35:58,157 --> 02:36:00,720
[SPEAKER_26]: I am in support of this zoning proposal.

1720
02:36:01,641 --> 02:36:06,005
[SPEAKER_26]: Like previous speakers, though, I do think that we should not have an R1.

1721
02:36:06,746 --> 02:36:09,268
[SPEAKER_26]: I would rather that we're not zoning for single families.

1722
02:36:11,732 --> 02:36:14,334
[SPEAKER_26]: A couple things like it's graduation season.

1723
02:36:14,734 --> 02:36:26,463
[SPEAKER_26]: And as a parent and a teacher, I'm just always wondering like what, where are all these kids going to go that, you know, are graduating from Medford High and what housing is going to be available for them in the future.

1724
02:36:27,243 --> 02:36:34,130
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm fortunate enough to live in a neighborhood that was built before the current zoning regulations.

1725
02:36:34,210 --> 02:36:41,017
[SPEAKER_26]: I think that most of my neighborhood would no longer be allowed to exist under the current proposals.

1726
02:36:42,218 --> 02:36:48,224
[SPEAKER_26]: And so I really think that we need to move toward more density and less restrictive zoning.

1727
02:36:48,565 --> 02:36:48,905
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1728
02:36:50,026 --> 02:36:50,567
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Caitlin.

1729
02:37:04,175 --> 02:37:05,616
[SPEAKER_42]: We're going to do a five.

1730
02:37:06,636 --> 02:37:09,477
[SPEAKER_42]: Five minute break, um, for human needs.

1731
02:37:12,198 --> 02:37:14,218
[SPEAKER_42]: And then we're going to go into the zoom comment.

1732
02:37:14,238 --> 02:37:17,019
[SPEAKER_42]: We're going to go back to the public comment.

1733
02:37:17,399 --> 02:37:22,661
[SPEAKER_42]: The next three public commenters and if you're here, just raise your hand so I can kind of like keep keep going.

1734
02:37:22,701 --> 02:37:26,582
[SPEAKER_42]: If we don't have people is, um, Parkman lovering.

1735
02:37:29,343 --> 02:37:30,103
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay, thank you.

1736
02:37:31,884 --> 02:37:32,684
[SPEAKER_42]: Um, D hatch.

1737
02:37:34,965 --> 02:37:35,866
[SPEAKER_42]: Not here, okay.

1738
02:37:37,087 --> 02:37:37,868
[SPEAKER_42]: William Snyder.

1739
02:37:37,888 --> 02:37:39,429
[SPEAKER_42]: Hi, William.

1740
02:37:40,090 --> 02:37:40,430
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay.

1741
02:37:41,651 --> 02:37:42,752
[SPEAKER_42]: Susan DeArcy Fuller.

1742
02:37:43,493 --> 02:37:44,013
[SPEAKER_41]: Hi, Susan.

1743
02:37:44,033 --> 02:37:46,636
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay.

1744
02:37:46,956 --> 02:37:47,697
[SPEAKER_42]: Donna Modica.

1745
02:37:49,238 --> 02:37:49,679
[SPEAKER_42]: Hi, Donna.

1746
02:37:49,939 --> 02:37:53,943
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay, you three are gonna be next in person after the break.

1747
02:37:54,783 --> 02:37:56,145
[SPEAKER_42]: When we come back, we'll be doing Zoom.

1748
02:37:58,475 --> 02:38:01,320
[SPEAKER_42]: Sorry if that's confusing, but thank you to everybody.

1749
02:38:02,182 --> 02:38:04,266
[SPEAKER_42]: So five minute break, we're gonna resume at 9.30.

1750
02:38:04,366 --> 02:38:04,666
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

1751
02:38:29,113 --> 02:38:31,954
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm going to call the board members back to their seats.

1752
02:38:33,135 --> 02:38:36,216
[SPEAKER_42]: And we're going to get started with additional Zoom commenters.

1753
02:38:42,279 --> 02:38:43,440
[SPEAKER_42]: I really don't want to use it.

1754
02:38:45,121 --> 02:38:48,162
[SPEAKER_37]: All right, we're going to get started.

1755
02:38:48,702 --> 02:38:52,104
[SPEAKER_37]: There we go.

1756
02:38:53,825 --> 02:38:54,765
[SPEAKER_42]: I don't think I do it well.

1757
02:38:58,253 --> 02:38:58,613
[SPEAKER_42]: Good gavel.

1758
02:38:58,633 --> 02:39:05,462
[SPEAKER_42]: All right, we're gonna move on to our next Zoom commenter, Zachary Shertock.

1759
02:39:07,645 --> 02:39:08,266
[SPEAKER_42]: I can unmute.

1760
02:39:11,971 --> 02:39:12,552
[SPEAKER_43]: Hey, Zachary.

1761
02:39:12,572 --> 02:39:13,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, can you hear me?

1762
02:39:14,938 --> 02:39:15,759
[SPEAKER_43]: Yes, thank you.

1763
02:39:16,500 --> 02:39:18,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent sector talk 5 on 1 street.

1764
02:39:18,463 --> 02:39:29,700
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I want to start off by reaffirming that yes, density is coming here and we need to plan for it, but the nature of how this process is going still has inadequacies and is rushed, especially compared to other efforts.

1765
02:39:29,740 --> 02:39:30,361
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been a part of.

1766
02:39:31,102 --> 02:39:48,240
[SPEAKER_02]: To that end, the notion that pushback or criticism is geared towards advocating for the status quo is not true and really spinning it that way is doing a lot of damage toward disenfranchising some people in our city who are raising good questions and concerns here tonight, especially for things like public safety and infrastructure inventories.

1767
02:39:49,201 --> 02:39:59,210
[SPEAKER_02]: To that end, there are underpinnings in the housing market that aren't really being factored into the equation as we seek to do our part in the process of a severely lacking regional master planning and policy effort.

1768
02:39:59,870 --> 02:40:15,664
[SPEAKER_02]: As someone with 16 years of policy advisory in this arena alongside my day job, along with formal training in planning and civil engineering, and experience in transportation planning and economic development, including in Massachusetts, there are some real red flags in how this is being done, many of which I've raised already to the board.

1769
02:40:17,047 --> 02:40:20,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Past that comment, this part is directed.

1770
02:40:21,837 --> 02:40:24,418
[SPEAKER_02]: to the inquiry from board member Adam Behrens.

1771
02:40:25,058 --> 02:40:36,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Google Scholar will return several studies done on the impact of upzoning, downzoning, and code adjustments and permitting to a variety of different urban, suburban, and rural transitional environments, including their subsegmentation where applicable.

1772
02:40:37,143 --> 02:40:48,527
[SPEAKER_02]: The subject has actually been studied quite extensively, and when I went through my own training during my civil engineering degree for the urban planning component, we had mandatory case review on the subject, and it was standard for entry into the OIQ.

1773
02:40:50,007 --> 02:40:53,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Examples include studies and publications by Pugachinsky and T.R.

1774
02:40:53,231 --> 02:41:00,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Sass, as well as Freemark, Serkin, and Lai, and they range from the 90s to today with historical comparative evolutionary and conditional mapping.

1775
02:41:01,019 --> 02:41:05,543
[SPEAKER_02]: The notion that it can't be studied is not true by practicum and academic standards, and

1776
02:41:06,384 --> 02:41:13,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Had we gotten the proper data been sourced up front for planning prior to zoning, we actually could have done financial and planning projections.

1777
02:41:14,290 --> 02:41:23,057
[SPEAKER_02]: But since it wasn't done, something that I've raised more than once to this board, we have a current speculative basis for the current plans and changes that haven't continued to be made.

1778
02:41:23,778 --> 02:41:27,461
[SPEAKER_02]: My comment here is not a matter of no or against, but a matter of do it right the first time.

1779
02:41:27,681 --> 02:41:28,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1780
02:41:28,081 --> 02:41:31,484
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you, Zachary.

1781
02:41:33,245 --> 02:41:35,287
[SPEAKER_42]: Our next commenter is John Koiner.

1782
02:41:39,430 --> 02:41:40,070
[SPEAKER_23]: Hello, can you hear me?

1783
02:41:41,191 --> 02:41:41,992
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes, thank you, John.

1784
02:41:42,692 --> 02:41:42,972
[SPEAKER_23]: Great.

1785
02:41:43,933 --> 02:41:47,835
[SPEAKER_23]: I'd like to thank the board and his associates for this excellent proposal.

1786
02:41:47,855 --> 02:41:48,536
[SPEAKER_23]: It's very exciting.

1787
02:41:48,556 --> 02:42:06,707
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm John Koiner, 800 Highland Avenue, where in this house, we believe there's a severe housing shortage and to address it, Medford should remove barriers to home construction as much as possible, wherever possible, with urgency appropriate to the scale and severity of this crisis.

1788
02:42:07,888 --> 02:42:16,092
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm going to echo what others have said that it would be great if we could allow two family homes by right in most or all of the city.

1789
02:42:18,913 --> 02:42:23,995
[SPEAKER_23]: It would be great if we could allow three family homes along major corridors.

1790
02:42:24,316 --> 02:42:25,556
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll give an example of what I'm talking about.

1791
02:42:25,636 --> 02:42:30,818
[SPEAKER_23]: So on Highland Ave, where I live, it's a huge wide road with bus service.

1792
02:42:31,579 --> 02:42:35,721
[SPEAKER_23]: It's accessible to Malden Center by foot, very convenient by bike.

1793
02:42:37,261 --> 02:42:45,526
[SPEAKER_23]: Highland is the northern extension of a densely developed mixed-use corridor through Malden that happens to extend into Bedford.

1794
02:42:47,387 --> 02:42:51,410
[SPEAKER_23]: This neighborhood could support triple-deckers and some mixed-use development.

1795
02:42:51,450 --> 02:42:52,390
[SPEAKER_23]: The infrastructure is there.

1796
02:42:53,451 --> 02:42:54,271
[SPEAKER_23]: That's just one example.

1797
02:42:54,431 --> 02:42:59,374
[SPEAKER_23]: I gave some other examples in an email to the CDB, CBD, anyway.

1798
02:43:02,614 --> 02:43:03,294
[SPEAKER_23]: One final thought.

1799
02:43:03,955 --> 02:43:09,157
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't believe that private ownership of a road or street precludes development there.

1800
02:43:10,697 --> 02:43:13,498
[SPEAKER_23]: That doesn't make sense.

1801
02:43:13,778 --> 02:43:15,259
[SPEAKER_23]: With that, I'll sign off.

1802
02:43:15,479 --> 02:43:15,959
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, everyone.

1803
02:43:15,979 --> 02:43:16,439
[SPEAKER_23]: Have a good evening.

1804
02:43:22,602 --> 02:43:23,082
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you, John.

1805
02:43:23,962 --> 02:43:26,343
[SPEAKER_42]: Our next Zoom commenter is Matthew Reich.

1806
02:43:27,625 --> 02:43:28,966
[SPEAKER_34]: Hello, my name is Matthew Reich.

1807
02:43:29,046 --> 02:43:33,568
[SPEAKER_34]: I live at 29 Adams Street with my spouse, Penny Shorts.

1808
02:43:33,628 --> 02:43:35,909
[SPEAKER_34]: We've lived here for 42 years.

1809
02:43:36,749 --> 02:43:43,713
[SPEAKER_34]: While I appreciate the effort of this committee and approve of

1810
02:43:44,593 --> 02:43:50,275
[SPEAKER_34]: the changes required to commercial districts and adjoining residential districts.

1811
02:43:50,955 --> 02:43:59,218
[SPEAKER_34]: I'd like to express my adamant opposition to the conversion of the hillside residential area to neighborhood residential three.

1812
02:44:00,378 --> 02:44:12,044
[SPEAKER_34]: I think that that change will amount to, in effect, a taking for current residents and a benefit for developers.

1813
02:44:13,985 --> 02:44:28,632
[SPEAKER_34]: As was mentioned in an earlier comment, there is no mechanism to assure that any additional housing will be affordable or even less expensively priced.

1814
02:44:30,106 --> 02:44:35,673
[SPEAKER_34]: And the physical character of the nomenclature will greatly change.

1815
02:44:36,401 --> 02:44:53,668
[SPEAKER_34]: For an example of what this will look like, one has to look no further than the corner of Corinthian Road and Broadway, the east corner of that intersection at Somerville, where a recent teardown has been replaced by two large four-story buildings.

1816
02:44:54,708 --> 02:44:56,889
[SPEAKER_34]: I think it's six units.

1817
02:44:56,929 --> 02:44:57,689
[SPEAKER_34]: It might be eight.

1818
02:44:58,469 --> 02:45:00,750
[SPEAKER_34]: The sign board out says prices of them at $860,000 a piece.

1819
02:45:00,770 --> 02:45:00,990
[SPEAKER_34]: 30 seconds.

1820
02:45:06,512 --> 02:45:21,164
[SPEAKER_34]: I think I would suggest that the impact on current residents should be very carefully considered.

1821
02:45:21,544 --> 02:45:21,904
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

1822
02:45:24,246 --> 02:45:24,927
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you, Matthew.

1823
02:45:26,648 --> 02:45:33,714
[SPEAKER_42]: Moving into our in-person commenters, we have William Snyder, Susan DeArce Fuller, and Donna Morica.

1824
02:45:39,271 --> 02:45:39,342
[SPEAKER_55]: Bye.

1825
02:45:41,383 --> 02:45:41,643
[SPEAKER_55]: Hello.

1826
02:45:42,144 --> 02:45:42,784
[SPEAKER_55]: Hi.

1827
02:45:42,864 --> 02:45:43,605
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you very much.

1828
02:45:44,605 --> 02:45:47,907
[SPEAKER_55]: And thank you for having me here in the consultants.

1829
02:45:48,148 --> 02:45:50,389
[SPEAKER_55]: I'm William Snyder.

1830
02:45:50,409 --> 02:45:51,370
[SPEAKER_55]: I live on Warren Street.

1831
02:45:51,450 --> 02:45:56,934
[SPEAKER_55]: We purchased our first and only house on Warren Street 25 years ago, a single family house in a single family zone.

1832
02:45:57,874 --> 02:45:58,615
[SPEAKER_55]: We love the house.

1833
02:45:58,735 --> 02:46:03,578
[SPEAKER_55]: It's built in 1894, and we've been investing in it.

1834
02:46:04,459 --> 02:46:08,482
[SPEAKER_55]: Stonework in the back, new flooring, new roof, solar system.

1835
02:46:11,164 --> 02:46:19,210
[SPEAKER_55]: So I oppose the rush to permit development of wall to wall triplexes in my neighborhood in West Medford.

1836
02:46:20,851 --> 02:46:26,796
[SPEAKER_55]: I know that many people around me only now are kind of realizing the consequences of this change.

1837
02:46:27,677 --> 02:46:35,764
[SPEAKER_55]: You know, just yesterday and the day before, we're starting to find people that didn't know about this and are starting to learn about what's gonna happen.

1838
02:46:37,644 --> 02:46:47,827
[SPEAKER_55]: I also believe our building department and zoning code, even though it has been revised, isn't really ready for the onslaught of developers and their attorneys maximizing profit to build luxury units.

1839
02:46:50,987 --> 02:47:04,111
[SPEAKER_55]: For us, and maybe for a couple of other near retired people on the street I've spoken with, our choice is to stay and watch construction noise and dust happen, or to sell out to developers and move to Concord, right?

1840
02:47:06,651 --> 02:47:11,115
[SPEAKER_55]: So to compete with families, developers are going to need to pay about a million dollars for one of these buildable lots.

1841
02:47:11,135 --> 02:47:18,221
[SPEAKER_55]: They're going to pay a million dollars to build the triplex, and they're going to want good money for those three units and the ADU.

1842
02:47:18,841 --> 02:47:20,863
[SPEAKER_55]: So this isn't really going to bring down housing costs.

1843
02:47:23,225 --> 02:47:27,088
[SPEAKER_55]: One question I did have is, what is a half a parking space?

1844
02:47:30,703 --> 02:47:31,384
[SPEAKER_42]: We round up.

1845
02:47:31,844 --> 02:47:32,084
[SPEAKER_55]: Pardon?

1846
02:47:32,645 --> 02:47:34,906
[SPEAKER_42]: We would round up round up or down up.

1847
02:47:35,627 --> 02:47:36,207
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay, thank you.

1848
02:47:37,248 --> 02:47:39,190
[SPEAKER_42]: Good question, though.

1849
02:47:40,991 --> 02:47:41,512
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you, William.

1850
02:47:41,692 --> 02:47:41,932
[SPEAKER_42]: Susan.

1851
02:47:41,992 --> 02:47:42,032
[SPEAKER_42]: Hi.

1852
02:47:48,736 --> 02:47:49,296
[SPEAKER_27]: Good evening.

1853
02:47:50,537 --> 02:47:55,381
[SPEAKER_27]: My name is Susan Darcy, and I'm the homeowner of 20 Jackson Road in West Medford.

1854
02:47:55,401 --> 02:47:58,584
[SPEAKER_27]: I want to thank you for the opportunity to allow me to speak tonight.

1855
02:47:58,604 --> 02:48:06,871
[SPEAKER_27]: I am requesting a pause on the rezoning decision for West Medford until adequate community feedback can be considered.

1856
02:48:08,652 --> 02:48:17,640
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm in favor of addressing the housing shortage as well as reinvigorating West Medford Square, but not at the expense of decimating the neighborhood we currently love.

1857
02:48:19,484 --> 02:48:22,966
[SPEAKER_27]: I want to express my strong concern regarding the proposed rezoning.

1858
02:48:24,046 --> 02:48:28,328
[SPEAKER_27]: This process has had insufficient time for public review and feedback.

1859
02:48:28,969 --> 02:48:36,673
[SPEAKER_27]: We've received a robo call about the meeting only recently, and it's clear that no effective communication methods were utilized to reach out to neighbors.

1860
02:48:37,953 --> 02:48:47,578
[SPEAKER_27]: Such a significant change demands proper notification either posted in our neighborhoods or mailed directly to residents to give everyone adequate time to voice their opinions.

1861
02:48:48,621 --> 02:48:51,762
[SPEAKER_27]: I also would like to have clear guidance on how to submit comments.

1862
02:48:53,403 --> 02:49:00,065
[SPEAKER_27]: The proposed rezoning will drastically alter our community and threaten its character, which is deeply valued by its residents.

1863
02:49:00,626 --> 02:49:06,748
[SPEAKER_27]: While I support the need for increased housing, this can be achieved without compromising the unique essence of our neighborhood.

1864
02:49:07,966 --> 02:49:16,395
[SPEAKER_27]: specifically, I strongly oppose the conversion of areas currently designed for single family homes to resident neighborhood residential three.

1865
02:49:17,096 --> 02:49:27,787
[SPEAKER_27]: This shift is excessive and I firmly believe that instead we could make all single family homes neighborhood residential to not just those in areas that are closer to transportation.

1866
02:49:28,247 --> 02:49:30,389
[SPEAKER_27]: This feels like a far more sensible approach to me.

1867
02:49:31,150 --> 02:49:31,890
[SPEAKER_27]: neighborhood residential three.

1868
02:49:31,910 --> 02:49:35,571
[SPEAKER_27]: Furthermore I feel changing neighborhood zone that are to family into urban residential.

1869
02:49:35,691 --> 02:49:39,392
[SPEAKER_27]: One is also excessive, particularly in the West Medford area.

1870
02:49:39,912 --> 02:49:46,714
[SPEAKER_27]: But I feel that the conversion of those neighborhoods to neighborhood residential three is the limit of what we should be considered.

1871
02:49:47,814 --> 02:49:53,616
[SPEAKER_27]: Um these adjustments alone would allow our neighborhood to accommodate at least twice as many families without

1872
02:50:00,272 --> 02:50:02,353
[SPEAKER_27]: I urge you to reassess the proposed setbacks.

1873
02:50:02,513 --> 02:50:07,775
[SPEAKER_27]: A 10 ft setback will create a stark and urban environment with minimal greenery and visual appeal.

1874
02:50:08,415 --> 02:50:10,336
[SPEAKER_27]: It's essential to maintain the current setbacks.

1875
02:50:11,496 --> 02:50:14,077
[SPEAKER_27]: The zoning should also be the same on both sides of the street.

1876
02:50:14,397 --> 02:50:25,421
[SPEAKER_27]: The way the maps look now, it looks like it's largely block by block versus by street, which creates a situation where two sides of the street have different zoning, and this is an issue with unfair difference in housing values.

1877
02:50:26,875 --> 02:50:28,677
[SPEAKER_27]: We have a lot of historic houses in the area.

1878
02:50:29,157 --> 02:50:37,426
[SPEAKER_27]: I also would like to know, will they be allowed to be torn down by a developer or will the historic commission still be evaluating what homes are valuable to the character of the neighborhood?

1879
02:50:39,729 --> 02:50:40,049
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

1880
02:50:46,656 --> 02:50:47,257
[SPEAKER_42]: Is Donna here?

1881
02:50:47,878 --> 02:50:48,078
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi.

1882
02:50:48,498 --> 02:50:48,819
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi, Donna.

1883
02:50:51,195 --> 02:50:52,717
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi, I'm Donna Monica.

1884
02:50:52,817 --> 02:51:09,474
[SPEAKER_19]: I live at 36 Woodland Road, and I want to say thank you to the Community Development Board members, to the city staff, and to the representatives of INDA's associates for inviting all of us to come in person and to commit your time to meeting and hearing from residents in person.

1885
02:51:10,195 --> 02:51:10,575
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1886
02:51:11,336 --> 02:51:13,777
[SPEAKER_19]: I am a lifelong resident of Medford.

1887
02:51:13,997 --> 02:51:15,578
[SPEAKER_19]: The city is my home.

1888
02:51:16,158 --> 02:51:18,420
[SPEAKER_19]: My husband and I met at Medford High School.

1889
02:51:18,940 --> 02:51:23,762
[SPEAKER_19]: We raised our children here, and we've cared for our aging parents in this community.

1890
02:51:24,503 --> 02:51:29,165
[SPEAKER_19]: Medford has given us so much, and I care very deeply about its future.

1891
02:51:30,176 --> 02:51:46,034
[SPEAKER_19]: Since learning about the proposed zoning changes in late May, I've been doing my best to get informed, attending meetings when I can, listening to the Zoom recordings during my commute, talking to neighbors, and reviewing updates posted to the city website.

1892
02:51:46,495 --> 02:51:47,836
[SPEAKER_19]: I appreciate that information.

1893
02:51:49,174 --> 02:51:50,495
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a lot to process.

1894
02:51:52,337 --> 02:52:02,926
[SPEAKER_19]: Changes to the residential neighborhoods, understanding the technical terminology, the alphabet of acronyms, the corridors, the squares, the proposed parking adjustments.

1895
02:52:03,546 --> 02:52:09,271
[SPEAKER_19]: For residents, balancing one job, two jobs, the caregiving of children and elderly parents.

1896
02:52:10,132 --> 02:52:10,753
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a lot.

1897
02:52:11,655 --> 02:52:20,970
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think people need, residents need more time to be able to understand the significant changes that could happen and impact our city for decades.

1898
02:52:22,045 --> 02:52:35,130
[SPEAKER_19]: a second point I'd like to make is that a topic that has not received any attention, I feel, is the impact of the changes on Medford's essential services and emergency response systems.

1899
02:52:35,970 --> 02:52:46,895
[SPEAKER_19]: With increased housing density, our streets, sidewalks, water and sewer, fire and police departments, our schools will need to serve a larger population.

1900
02:52:47,935 --> 02:52:49,836
[SPEAKER_19]: public safety must be a priority.

1901
02:52:50,176 --> 02:52:55,078
[SPEAKER_19]: Fire response times, police coverage, traffic and parking congestion.

1902
02:52:55,098 --> 02:52:57,059
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm sorry, I didn't give you the 30 second warning.

1903
02:52:57,099 --> 02:52:57,899
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm giving you that now.

1904
02:52:58,120 --> 02:52:58,440
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1905
02:52:58,760 --> 02:53:01,201
[SPEAKER_19]: Affecting emergency routes and neighborhood streets.

1906
02:53:01,801 --> 02:53:05,443
[SPEAKER_19]: All of these factors directly impact the well being of every resident.

1907
02:53:06,083 --> 02:53:17,268
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's imperative for the Community Development Board to provide clear projections and analysis for how emergency services, infrastructure and personnel may be affected.

1908
02:53:17,708 --> 02:53:19,428
[SPEAKER_19]: under various levels of development.

1909
02:53:20,129 --> 02:53:28,051
[SPEAKER_19]: The zoning changes will have lasting consequences and we cannot afford to underestimate the strain on essential services.

1910
02:53:29,151 --> 02:53:37,053
[SPEAKER_19]: I strongly urge the board to thoroughly research and present a plan that can help ensure Medford's safety before a vote is taken.

1911
02:53:37,865 --> 02:53:42,028
[SPEAKER_19]: city leaders are responsible and they can they must consider and they're dedicated.

1912
02:53:42,048 --> 02:53:43,629
[SPEAKER_19]: That was 30 seconds.

1913
02:53:43,649 --> 02:53:44,029
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you mind?

1914
02:53:44,089 --> 02:53:44,569
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1915
02:53:44,669 --> 02:53:45,010
[SPEAKER_19]: Yep.

1916
02:53:45,330 --> 02:53:50,033
[SPEAKER_19]: My point is that city leaders need to keep residents safe.

1917
02:53:50,313 --> 02:53:54,156
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think we as a community need to support them in doing that.

1918
02:53:54,596 --> 02:53:54,976
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1919
02:53:55,537 --> 02:53:56,017
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you, Donna.

1920
02:54:02,168 --> 02:54:03,969
[SPEAKER_42]: So we're going to go back to the Zoom commenters.

1921
02:54:04,809 --> 02:54:11,111
[SPEAKER_42]: The next three in-person commenters, just raise your hand if you're still here, and thank you so much to everybody that is still here.

1922
02:54:11,131 --> 02:54:12,691
[SPEAKER_42]: Tom Modica?

1923
02:54:12,711 --> 02:54:14,832
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay.

1924
02:54:18,313 --> 02:54:19,153
[SPEAKER_42]: Peter Sigourney?

1925
02:54:21,694 --> 02:54:22,454
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay, thank you.

1926
02:54:23,975 --> 02:54:24,675
[SPEAKER_42]: Ellen Epstein?

1927
02:54:25,175 --> 02:54:25,655
[SPEAKER_42]: Sharon?

1928
02:54:25,675 --> 02:54:29,256
[SPEAKER_42]: Great.

1929
02:54:33,480 --> 02:54:36,381
[SPEAKER_42]: Um, Alexander loosen hop loosen cop.

1930
02:54:36,942 --> 02:54:37,122
[SPEAKER_42]: Great.

1931
02:54:37,182 --> 02:54:37,982
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you, Alexander.

1932
02:54:38,142 --> 02:54:41,764
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay, so you three will be next when we come back from zoom.

1933
02:54:42,504 --> 02:54:50,688
[SPEAKER_42]: And then I think after those next three in person commenters as a board, we should kind of take a step back and think about how we want to proceed with this.

1934
02:54:51,148 --> 02:54:55,110
[SPEAKER_42]: We do still have additional commenters, but I think it'll benefit us to just

1935
02:54:57,717 --> 02:54:58,858
[SPEAKER_42]: start thinking about what's next.

1936
02:54:59,518 --> 02:55:00,679
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay.

1937
02:55:00,719 --> 02:55:05,561
[SPEAKER_42]: So our next zoom commenter is Catherine Thorne.

1938
02:55:05,581 --> 02:55:12,224
[SPEAKER_42]: Hi, can you hear me?

1939
02:55:12,865 --> 02:55:13,045
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes.

1940
02:55:13,145 --> 02:55:13,805
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you, Catherine.

1941
02:55:14,165 --> 02:55:14,406
[SPEAKER_39]: All right.

1942
02:55:14,706 --> 02:55:15,666
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm Catherine Thorne.

1943
02:55:15,766 --> 02:55:18,708
[SPEAKER_39]: I live at 47 Circuit Street in West Medford.

1944
02:55:18,948 --> 02:55:19,048
[SPEAKER_39]: And

1945
02:55:19,763 --> 02:55:23,647
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm speaking on behalf of myself and my husband, Jim Kang.

1946
02:55:23,667 --> 02:55:28,512
[SPEAKER_39]: Our home is in one of the areas that would be upzoned to urban residential two.

1947
02:55:29,093 --> 02:55:32,617
[SPEAKER_39]: My husband and I both strongly support the proposed rezoning.

1948
02:55:33,402 --> 02:55:35,244
[SPEAKER_39]: We, I don't have a prepared statement.

1949
02:55:35,344 --> 02:55:36,925
[SPEAKER_39]: I just, I like where I live.

1950
02:55:37,085 --> 02:55:38,406
[SPEAKER_39]: I like how walkable it is.

1951
02:55:38,446 --> 02:55:39,367
[SPEAKER_39]: We can walk to school.

1952
02:55:39,387 --> 02:55:40,628
[SPEAKER_39]: We can walk to parks.

1953
02:55:41,349 --> 02:55:43,711
[SPEAKER_39]: And I want more families to be able to experience that.

1954
02:55:43,931 --> 02:55:51,297
[SPEAKER_39]: And I want West Bedford especially and all of Medford to thrive for both residents and local small businesses.

1955
02:55:51,637 --> 02:55:53,479
[SPEAKER_39]: And thank you for all the work you've done.

1956
02:55:57,282 --> 02:55:57,982
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you, Catherine.

1957
02:55:59,223 --> 02:56:00,785
[SPEAKER_42]: Our next commenter is Yulia.

1958
02:56:09,193 --> 02:56:09,473
[SPEAKER_42]: again.

1959
02:56:10,594 --> 02:56:11,936
[SPEAKER_30]: Can you hear me?

1960
02:56:11,956 --> 02:56:12,757
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes, we can hear you now.

1961
02:56:12,837 --> 02:56:13,197
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

1962
02:56:13,277 --> 02:56:13,697
[SPEAKER_30]: Hi there.

1963
02:56:13,898 --> 02:56:23,047
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak and I'm going to echo a lot of what some other folks have said who are in opposition to the proposed changes.

1964
02:56:23,307 --> 02:56:25,929
[SPEAKER_30]: I live on Sagamore Ave in West Medford.

1965
02:56:26,530 --> 02:56:27,491
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm a homeowner.

1966
02:56:27,511 --> 02:56:28,352
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm a parent.

1967
02:56:29,112 --> 02:56:30,753
[SPEAKER_30]: Um, and I do have some concerns.

1968
02:56:30,873 --> 02:56:44,156
[SPEAKER_30]: I think these things have been touched upon, but not actually addressed specifically how to address already existing staffing shortages in our public schools, which would be further strained by an increase in population resulting from proposed zoning and development changes.

1969
02:56:44,957 --> 02:56:49,298
[SPEAKER_30]: Our schools are currently struggling to retain teachers due to budget cuts.

1970
02:56:49,819 --> 02:56:52,261
[SPEAKER_30]: They have trouble retaining paraprofessionals and support staff.

1971
02:56:52,502 --> 02:57:01,431
[SPEAKER_30]: Increasing enrollment without a clear, actionable plan to expand staffing resources risks degrading the quality of education for both current and future students.

1972
02:57:02,131 --> 02:57:08,378
[SPEAKER_30]: In addition, and specifically, I know this for West Medford, there is an ongoing and critical lack of accessible, affordable afterschool care.

1973
02:57:09,495 --> 02:57:13,138
[SPEAKER_30]: For many working families such as ourselves, afterschool programs are essential.

1974
02:57:13,278 --> 02:57:22,785
[SPEAKER_30]: Without a comprehensive strategy to expand capacity staffing and funding for these services, the city will continue to fail families who rely on these programs for safety and stability.

1975
02:57:23,707 --> 02:57:36,093
[SPEAKER_30]: Beyond the school systems, I also urge the council to recognize the broader strain on public infrastructure and services that increased density will cause from emergency services to sanitation to public transportation and recreational facilities.

1976
02:57:36,674 --> 02:57:40,896
[SPEAKER_30]: Our community resources are not currently scaled to meet significant population growth.

1977
02:57:41,816 --> 02:57:47,798
[SPEAKER_30]: Approving developments without first addressing these capacity issues risk compounding the challenges our city already faces.

1978
02:57:47,838 --> 02:57:48,178
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

1979
02:57:48,978 --> 02:57:57,901
[SPEAKER_30]: Before moving forward with any zoning changes, I respectfully request that the city provide a detailed transparent plan that outlines how school staffing shortages will be resolved through mitigated

1980
02:57:58,611 --> 02:58:09,198
[SPEAKER_30]: what investments will be made to expand and fund afterschool care, how public services and infrastructure will be scaled and sustained to meet increased demand, and how these initiatives will be financed responsibly.

1981
02:58:09,819 --> 02:58:15,563
[SPEAKER_30]: Without these assurances, it would be irresponsible and inadequate to approve plans that further strain our already overburdened system.

1982
02:58:15,823 --> 02:58:17,664
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you for your attention to these critical issues.

1983
02:58:19,665 --> 02:58:20,406
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you, Yulia.

1984
02:58:21,046 --> 02:58:22,647
[SPEAKER_42]: Our next commenter is Kate M.

1985
02:58:29,010 --> 02:58:29,570
[SPEAKER_42]: Kate, are you there?

1986
02:58:29,590 --> 02:58:37,414
[SPEAKER_42]: All right, we're gonna move back to in-person comment.

1987
02:58:40,416 --> 02:58:41,136
[SPEAKER_42]: Where are we?

1988
02:58:41,237 --> 02:58:46,079
[SPEAKER_42]: So we have Tom, Sharon, and Alexander.

1989
02:58:48,921 --> 02:58:51,162
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you so much for your patience this evening.

1990
02:58:51,623 --> 02:58:55,444
[SPEAKER_53]: Thank you, Tom Modica, lifetime Medford resident.

1991
02:58:56,445 --> 02:59:00,646
[SPEAKER_53]: I obviously grew up here, rented for eight years, homeowner for 30.

1992
02:59:01,007 --> 02:59:03,428
[SPEAKER_53]: I live at 36 Woodland Road in Medford.

1993
02:59:04,428 --> 02:59:08,509
[SPEAKER_53]: A lot of the points that came up tonight I wanted to speak to, and I'll reiterate.

1994
02:59:08,710 --> 02:59:12,791
[SPEAKER_53]: One of the things was the public services, whether it's water, sewer.

1995
02:59:13,311 --> 02:59:15,292
[SPEAKER_53]: We're not ready for that with this big change.

1996
02:59:15,652 --> 02:59:17,273
[SPEAKER_53]: And first of all, I should have prefaced with,

1997
02:59:18,013 --> 02:59:19,914
[SPEAKER_53]: I applaud the work you're all doing.

1998
02:59:20,414 --> 02:59:21,455
[SPEAKER_53]: We do need change.

1999
02:59:21,515 --> 02:59:26,117
[SPEAKER_53]: We do need progression in the city, but I think we're going a little too fast.

2000
02:59:27,678 --> 02:59:35,662
[SPEAKER_53]: One of the things that I would say specifically is we're blanketing big changes in certain neighborhoods that will change the complexion.

2001
02:59:36,742 --> 02:59:38,483
[SPEAKER_53]: I'm going to change gears a little bit here.

2002
02:59:39,343 --> 02:59:43,105
[SPEAKER_53]: Earlier, somebody asked about different studies in different cities.

2003
02:59:43,165 --> 02:59:44,646
[SPEAKER_53]: We didn't really come up with an example.

2004
02:59:45,166 --> 02:59:51,789
[SPEAKER_53]: But I think if we look right next door, we see a very vibrant city and a city that's changed a lot over the years in Somerville.

2005
02:59:52,889 --> 02:59:57,231
[SPEAKER_53]: I think you see a lot of people over the past 20 years move to Somerville.

2006
02:59:58,151 --> 03:00:01,413
[SPEAKER_53]: One of the reasons I bring that up, again, it's very visible, but I know it well.

2007
03:00:01,433 --> 03:00:04,194
[SPEAKER_53]: I worked there for many years.

2008
03:00:06,415 --> 03:00:09,276
[SPEAKER_53]: the board on the Chamber of Commerce.

2009
03:00:09,717 --> 03:00:13,658
[SPEAKER_53]: And what they did first to bring in the vibrancy was to look at the corridors first.

2010
03:00:13,698 --> 03:00:15,239
[SPEAKER_53]: The corridors were most important.

2011
03:00:15,959 --> 03:00:18,060
[SPEAKER_53]: They brought vibrant business into the corridors.

2012
03:00:18,120 --> 03:00:19,181
[SPEAKER_53]: That invited people.

2013
03:00:19,501 --> 03:00:21,462
[SPEAKER_53]: That invited younger people into the city.

2014
03:00:22,162 --> 03:00:26,884
[SPEAKER_53]: And again, not to disparage us older people, but we want younger people in the city.

2015
03:00:26,924 --> 03:00:27,845
[SPEAKER_53]: We want vibrancy.

2016
03:00:28,725 --> 03:00:30,166
[SPEAKER_53]: But Medford isn't some of them.

2017
03:00:30,566 --> 03:00:33,627
[SPEAKER_53]: We have a much more diverse neighborhood system here.

2018
03:00:35,748 --> 03:00:38,530
[SPEAKER_53]: My wife and I brought our children up in the house we live in now.

2019
03:00:39,290 --> 03:00:40,091
[SPEAKER_53]: They moved on.

2020
03:00:40,351 --> 03:00:43,833
[SPEAKER_53]: And then all of a sudden, we saw a change in the neighborhood, but it wasn't changing.

2021
03:00:44,034 --> 03:00:44,394
[SPEAKER_53]: Thank you.

2022
03:00:45,374 --> 03:00:46,835
[SPEAKER_53]: More young families moved in.

2023
03:00:46,955 --> 03:00:47,256
[SPEAKER_53]: Why?

2024
03:00:47,276 --> 03:00:48,517
[SPEAKER_53]: Because that's what they wanted.

2025
03:00:48,897 --> 03:00:53,460
[SPEAKER_53]: They wanted to be in a neighborhood where their kids could ride their bikes around.

2026
03:00:53,500 --> 03:00:54,561
[SPEAKER_53]: They wanted that feel.

2027
03:00:54,981 --> 03:00:55,941
[SPEAKER_53]: They wanted gardens.

2028
03:00:56,582 --> 03:01:01,005
[SPEAKER_53]: So I would respectfully ask that we take a pause on this vote.

2029
03:01:01,105 --> 03:01:01,865
[SPEAKER_53]: We consider

2030
03:01:02,906 --> 03:01:04,387
[SPEAKER_53]: I think that would make a difference.

2031
03:01:04,407 --> 03:01:07,228
[SPEAKER_53]: We are much more diverse than one blanket change, and I request a pause on

2032
03:01:42,272 --> 03:01:45,644
[SPEAKER_31]: I keep praying for the growth gene, but I got a new hip instead.

2033
03:01:48,277 --> 03:01:52,240
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, I will say we don't have to thank everyone because it is our right to be here.

2034
03:01:52,880 --> 03:02:02,787
[SPEAKER_31]: But I do appreciate anyone who does do work for a city or a charity or et cetera with good intent in their communities.

2035
03:02:03,288 --> 03:02:11,313
[SPEAKER_31]: I have a couple of questions and I'd like to make a couple of general comments because I've heard a lot of discussion this evening and also in the past.

2036
03:02:11,954 --> 03:02:16,637
[SPEAKER_31]: I do believe that change is always inevitable.

2037
03:02:17,943 --> 03:02:20,646
[SPEAKER_31]: that even people can change a little bit.

2038
03:02:20,686 --> 03:02:29,554
[SPEAKER_31]: They can notice and self-reflect and change behavior, not drastically, but it can be usually for the better.

2039
03:02:30,555 --> 03:02:32,537
[SPEAKER_31]: We all want a little bit of progress.

2040
03:02:32,577 --> 03:02:35,720
[SPEAKER_31]: We like a little bit more productivity in Medford.

2041
03:02:35,880 --> 03:02:38,742
[SPEAKER_31]: We like a little bit more commercialism in Medford.

2042
03:02:39,864 --> 03:02:51,342
[SPEAKER_31]: But people along the line tonight, and I'm not saying this as a criticism, I would think that most of the people who do want super development fast are probably renting.

2043
03:02:52,975 --> 03:02:59,597
[SPEAKER_31]: A lot of people who have vested values in this city go lots and lots of years back.

2044
03:02:59,758 --> 03:03:11,522
[SPEAKER_31]: In fact, Councilman Michael Marks even dedicated an island, which I pay for and maintain now, florally, for my family, because my dad stayed so long in the Lawrence Estates.

2045
03:03:13,020 --> 03:03:15,861
[SPEAKER_31]: People are saying that they want their kids to grow up here.

2046
03:03:16,481 --> 03:03:17,602
[SPEAKER_31]: Where are they going to play?

2047
03:03:18,142 --> 03:03:29,206
[SPEAKER_31]: If you're going to do something on a 3,000 square foot lot, and everyone has a dog, your kids are going to be playing in a doggy park, because they're probably going to have to repossess the parks.

2048
03:03:29,886 --> 03:03:34,688
[SPEAKER_31]: But I will say that we know progress is coming.

2049
03:03:35,768 --> 03:03:41,331
[SPEAKER_31]: I really do think that the effects that happen will far outweigh

2050
03:03:42,691 --> 03:03:44,272
[SPEAKER_31]: any progress that you'd like to make.

2051
03:03:44,332 --> 03:03:51,318
[SPEAKER_31]: And I honestly want to give this question out to everyone who is strongly into this change.

2052
03:03:52,518 --> 03:03:57,639
[SPEAKER_31]: Do you really think affordable housing is going to come with this permit zoning change?

2053
03:03:58,219 --> 03:03:59,139
[SPEAKER_31]: Absolutely not.

2054
03:03:59,700 --> 03:04:13,302
[SPEAKER_31]: If a developer bought half a block out, just say, because maybe there were already two family homes in the square footage fit, do you really think they're going to apply to the state and the feds to put affordable housing there?

2055
03:04:13,822 --> 03:04:20,564
[SPEAKER_31]: Instead of the young people who do want to afford to stay here, like some of those graduate students who spoke before and degree earners,

2056
03:04:21,244 --> 03:04:22,284
[SPEAKER_31]: it's not going to happen.

2057
03:04:22,304 --> 03:04:24,445
[SPEAKER_31]: They're going to have to go out of the city.

2058
03:04:25,005 --> 03:04:31,827
[SPEAKER_31]: Much is going to come to this, and your air quality is going to be worsened for those who are environmentally involved.

2059
03:04:32,207 --> 03:04:33,207
[SPEAKER_31]: I thank you for your time.

2060
03:04:33,267 --> 03:04:41,149
[SPEAKER_31]: I think my time is up, and I hope that you take your time in this process and postpone it.

2061
03:04:41,169 --> 03:04:44,950
[SPEAKER_31]: And do not forget, your mayor can stop this.

2062
03:04:45,410 --> 03:04:46,290
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you very much.

2063
03:04:48,111 --> 03:04:48,691
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you, Sharon.

2064
03:04:53,288 --> 03:04:53,968
[SPEAKER_43]: Hi Alexander.

2065
03:04:54,128 --> 03:05:06,152
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, Alex lesson hop 30 right F. As a resident of South Medford one of Medford's denser neighborhoods, I support the proposal for updating the zoning and adding more housing to my neighborhood and throughout the city.

2066
03:05:06,532 --> 03:05:16,436
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, I would support this proposal going even further by allowing additional height and housing units by right, especially in urban residential to districts around T stops and along all major corridors and squares.

2067
03:05:16,956 --> 03:05:27,679
[SPEAKER_14]: I also strongly support the expanded proposal for at us which are a fantastic way to add housing stock, without much visible change to the fabric of neighborhood Medford's existing at law is too restrictive and needs to be fixed.

2068
03:05:28,400 --> 03:05:32,421
[SPEAKER_14]: I support these proposals because we have a severe housing shortage in Medford and across the state.

2069
03:05:33,021 --> 03:05:43,891
[SPEAKER_14]: This shortage has contributed to the sharp increase in housing prices in our region, forcing out so many of our low and middle income neighbors and making it so kids growing up in Medford have less opportunity to stay here if they so choose.

2070
03:05:44,231 --> 03:05:51,658
[SPEAKER_14]: This problem did not start yesterday, it is a result of years and years of stunted growth caused by things like restrictive zoning laws excessive parking requirements,

2071
03:05:51,958 --> 03:05:54,040
[SPEAKER_14]: and objections from existing residents.

2072
03:05:54,500 --> 03:05:58,783
[SPEAKER_14]: These proposals are not a silver bullet and there is so much more we need to do to address the housing crisis.

2073
03:05:59,223 --> 03:06:04,527
[SPEAKER_14]: However, if we don't update our zoning to allow even incremental growth like this, we have no hope of solving this problem.

2074
03:06:04,927 --> 03:06:09,890
[SPEAKER_14]: As the saying goes, maybe the best time to update our zoning was 30 or 40 years ago, but the second best time is now.

2075
03:06:10,311 --> 03:06:15,274
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's start planting the seeds that will allow Medford to grow into an even more vibrant and welcoming city than it is today.

2076
03:06:15,634 --> 03:06:20,318
[SPEAKER_14]: So I strongly urge the board to refer these proposals to City Council as is or in a more expansive form.

2077
03:06:20,358 --> 03:06:20,638
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2078
03:06:23,653 --> 03:06:24,494
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you, Alexander.

2079
03:06:24,514 --> 03:06:33,266
[SPEAKER_42]: OK, so this was the point where.

2080
03:06:38,972 --> 03:06:40,973
[SPEAKER_42]: we're gonna kind of discuss what's next.

2081
03:06:41,853 --> 03:06:43,194
[SPEAKER_42]: Just quick tally.

2082
03:06:43,294 --> 03:06:47,655
[SPEAKER_42]: We have nine plus eight, so 17.

2083
03:06:47,715 --> 03:06:50,476
[SPEAKER_42]: We have 17 people remaining to comment.

2084
03:06:50,516 --> 03:06:57,559
[SPEAKER_42]: That includes people who are signed up or people who have left because of the length of the evening.

2085
03:06:58,379 --> 03:07:00,900
[SPEAKER_42]: We have nine commenters remaining on Zoom.

2086
03:07:01,921 --> 03:07:02,421
[SPEAKER_42]: So that's what, 26?

2087
03:07:02,461 --> 03:07:04,322
[SPEAKER_42]: I counted 11 that were here.

2088
03:07:09,702 --> 03:07:13,103
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay, I only got eight, but I'll go with 11 err on the side of caution.

2089
03:07:13,684 --> 03:07:15,125
[SPEAKER_42]: So that ups us by another three.

2090
03:07:15,185 --> 03:07:15,485
[SPEAKER_42]: So that's 29.

2091
03:07:15,645 --> 03:07:26,491
[SPEAKER_42]: I mean, what I'm hearing, I'm not hearing a lot of I'm against this.

2092
03:07:27,691 --> 03:07:28,412
[SPEAKER_42]: Never do it.

2093
03:07:28,972 --> 03:07:33,695
[SPEAKER_42]: But I'm hearing a lot of is I'm in favor, or I'm in favor.

2094
03:07:33,715 --> 03:07:34,815
[SPEAKER_42]: That's slow.

2095
03:07:34,835 --> 03:07:34,895
[SPEAKER_42]: And

2096
03:07:39,307 --> 03:07:42,268
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm curious for any reactions from the rest of the board.

2097
03:07:42,288 --> 03:07:45,489
[SPEAKER_42]: Am I summarizing this well?

2098
03:07:46,310 --> 03:07:49,451
[SPEAKER_42]: Or am I only hearing what I want to hear?

2099
03:07:49,471 --> 03:07:53,612
[SPEAKER_42]: And I'm not going to recognize anybody.

2100
03:07:53,652 --> 03:07:55,393
[SPEAKER_42]: Just unmute yourselves or just talk.

2101
03:07:56,914 --> 03:07:57,974
[SPEAKER_37]: No, I think you're spot on.

2102
03:07:58,354 --> 03:07:58,414
[SPEAKER_42]: OK.

2103
03:07:58,494 --> 03:08:05,637
[SPEAKER_37]: I think there is a clear contingent of people who have been aware.

2104
03:08:07,126 --> 03:08:10,649
[SPEAKER_37]: have been participating and are eager to move forward.

2105
03:08:10,930 --> 03:08:25,582
[SPEAKER_37]: I admire the principles that they stand on, but I think there's also a non-trivial portion of participants, and those are the people who showed up today, right?

2106
03:08:26,083 --> 03:08:32,869
[SPEAKER_37]: So we're not accounting for the large numbers of people who are three weeks behind them, but there's a large number of people who spoke today who said that they

2107
03:08:34,015 --> 03:08:39,458
[SPEAKER_37]: only recently found out or live in neighborhoods where there's a serious lack of awareness.

2108
03:08:40,359 --> 03:08:41,359
[SPEAKER_37]: So I think you're spot on.

2109
03:08:43,320 --> 03:08:43,561
[SPEAKER_49]: John?

2110
03:08:44,821 --> 03:08:46,202
[SPEAKER_49]: I agree with your assessment.

2111
03:08:47,483 --> 03:08:55,808
[SPEAKER_49]: I think also it's kind of a challenge to us to do some research to answer some of the points people made.

2112
03:08:56,488 --> 03:09:03,312
[SPEAKER_49]: For example, there was an assertion that the city just wants to do this to raise more tax revenue.

2113
03:09:05,308 --> 03:09:10,672
[SPEAKER_49]: You know, there's been no analysis of what effect it has on taxation or demands on services.

2114
03:09:12,894 --> 03:09:23,401
[SPEAKER_49]: I think people, you know, the whole argument that anything to promote more housing promotes affordable housing needs to be looked at.

2115
03:09:23,421 --> 03:09:27,484
[SPEAKER_49]: There's an assumption there that should be analyzed.

2116
03:09:32,248 --> 03:09:34,889
[SPEAKER_49]: There's a lot more work to do neighborhood by neighborhood.

2117
03:09:35,949 --> 03:09:50,154
[SPEAKER_49]: I heard people saying that they bought into a particular neighborhood and they have some expectation that of course things will change, but they're concerned that things will change overnight.

2118
03:09:52,095 --> 03:09:58,117
[SPEAKER_49]: So I think those people need, their concerns need to be thoughtfully considered.

2119
03:09:58,543 --> 03:09:58,743
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah.

2120
03:09:59,143 --> 03:10:05,666
[SPEAKER_42]: And in some cases like changes, you know, we might have capital D developers who will jump the second these things change.

2121
03:10:06,046 --> 03:10:18,850
[SPEAKER_42]: Um, we might also have thoughtful friends and neighbors who will finally, you know, be able to, uh, have a non, uh, non, non conforming property and be able to make the changes they've always wanted to make.

2122
03:10:18,950 --> 03:10:21,571
[SPEAKER_42]: So we need to consider both sides of it.

2123
03:10:22,071 --> 03:10:26,173
[SPEAKER_42]: Um, Ari, I know you were about to say something,

2124
03:10:26,735 --> 03:10:28,615
[SPEAKER_42]: I want to pass it off to you before I keep yapping.

2125
03:10:29,996 --> 03:10:33,377
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

2126
03:10:33,397 --> 03:10:38,638
[SPEAKER_35]: I came into this meeting excited to hear all the input.

2127
03:10:38,658 --> 03:10:41,219
[SPEAKER_35]: I think we have been working on this for a long time.

2128
03:10:41,759 --> 03:10:48,960
[SPEAKER_35]: And also I do take very genuinely and seriously the number of people who have not been involved and are joining now.

2129
03:10:49,661 --> 03:10:54,762
[SPEAKER_35]: I do want us to recognize that kind of the status quo is also a risk.

2130
03:10:56,709 --> 03:11:09,581
[SPEAKER_35]: And many aspects of the current zoning allow for developers who know that Medford is an appealing place to live and are making choices before we've been able to be more intentional.

2131
03:11:11,122 --> 03:11:14,505
[SPEAKER_35]: And even thinking about some recent cases that have been before this board.

2132
03:11:15,686 --> 03:11:18,769
[SPEAKER_35]: So I think we should

2133
03:11:19,695 --> 03:11:22,516
[SPEAKER_35]: delay the vote, um, at least to next time.

2134
03:11:22,576 --> 03:11:30,440
[SPEAKER_35]: But I also think that we should, um, kind of work on having a clear list of questions and a plan.

2135
03:11:30,460 --> 03:11:38,143
[SPEAKER_35]: Um, I don't think just slowing down or starting over will get us to a place that any of us want.

2136
03:11:38,984 --> 03:11:48,348
[SPEAKER_35]: Um, but I, but I do hear that it feels like the public has more to say than we are able to hear tonight.

2137
03:11:49,818 --> 03:11:51,239
[SPEAKER_42]: the public definitely has more to say.

2138
03:11:51,459 --> 03:11:57,623
[SPEAKER_42]: And, you know, if we do continue this to the next meeting, you know, that's a week out.

2139
03:11:58,583 --> 03:12:06,128
[SPEAKER_42]: Even if we continue it to July, that's, you know, a couple weeks out, and then we start to get into, you know, people not being around for vacations.

2140
03:12:06,168 --> 03:12:17,374
[SPEAKER_42]: And I know that's not a reason to not do something, but we want to be considerate of the public, the continued public involvement in the process.

2141
03:12:19,992 --> 03:12:40,485
[SPEAKER_37]: I think one of the challenges that I know that I have had and that I would imagine a lot of people, certainly people who are only recently becoming aware of these proposed changes are likely having is a little bit of panic about timelines, right?

2142
03:12:40,545 --> 03:12:43,146
[SPEAKER_37]: It's like, are we voting this week?

2143
03:12:43,787 --> 03:12:44,887
[SPEAKER_37]: We might be voting this week.

2144
03:12:45,128 --> 03:12:45,688
[SPEAKER_37]: Oh, wait a minute.

2145
03:12:45,948 --> 03:12:46,829
[SPEAKER_37]: Are we voting next time?

2146
03:12:46,869 --> 03:12:47,209
[SPEAKER_37]: I don't know.

2147
03:12:48,376 --> 03:12:48,656
[SPEAKER_37]: Right?

2148
03:12:49,276 --> 03:12:50,957
[SPEAKER_37]: Shoot, I had to miss a meeting, right?

2149
03:12:50,977 --> 03:12:52,798
[SPEAKER_37]: I had to travel, I had to do, you know, whatever.

2150
03:12:52,818 --> 03:12:57,079
[SPEAKER_37]: Today was the last day of school for Medford Public Schools.

2151
03:12:57,139 --> 03:13:04,502
[SPEAKER_37]: So I imagine there's a whole chunk of the population who, because it's the last day of school and they're living their lives, weren't able to participate.

2152
03:13:04,642 --> 03:13:06,323
[SPEAKER_37]: And that probably stresses some people.

2153
03:13:06,643 --> 03:13:07,983
[SPEAKER_37]: They had to make a call, right?

2154
03:13:08,424 --> 03:13:13,866
[SPEAKER_37]: Do I have my voice heard at City Hall or do I do what I gotta do with my family on the last day of school?

2155
03:13:14,306 --> 03:13:16,667
[SPEAKER_37]: And so where I'm going with this, sorry, it's kind of a long winded,

2156
03:13:17,657 --> 03:13:21,382
[SPEAKER_37]: Way to get to my point, but I think we would benefit from like.

2157
03:13:24,146 --> 03:13:30,395
[SPEAKER_37]: Putting some dates in the future, not like maybe it's next week or maybe it's the week after, but like.

2158
03:13:31,654 --> 03:13:37,596
[SPEAKER_37]: you know, a little bit better and the CDB board is probably, you know, needs to own this, right?

2159
03:13:37,676 --> 03:13:44,298
[SPEAKER_37]: But things came up today, for example, Alicia made a great point around historic conversions and what exactly does that mean?

2160
03:13:44,418 --> 03:13:48,139
[SPEAKER_37]: And then what recommendations do we have?

2161
03:13:48,199 --> 03:13:50,800
[SPEAKER_37]: I have a laundry list of these types of things.

2162
03:13:51,680 --> 03:13:57,382
[SPEAKER_37]: And maybe we need to start to like project manage this a little better as a board and say, we're gonna agree

2163
03:13:59,122 --> 03:14:08,445
[SPEAKER_37]: or agree to disagree on this piece of it on this date, aggressively and loudly and comprehensively communicate that to the public.

2164
03:14:09,925 --> 03:14:12,526
[SPEAKER_37]: And so you know, I don't have those dates right now.

2165
03:14:12,646 --> 03:14:19,008
[SPEAKER_37]: But I think maybe we can figure out how to do that offline and communicate something.

2166
03:14:19,148 --> 03:14:26,490
[SPEAKER_37]: But yeah, I mean, I'm definitely in favor of continuing the dialogue and not rushing to vote on something.

2167
03:14:30,143 --> 03:14:33,446
[SPEAKER_37]: That was my end of the evening rambling proposal.

2168
03:14:33,486 --> 03:14:41,973
[SPEAKER_40]: I hope that was OK.

2169
03:14:42,093 --> 03:14:42,373
[SPEAKER_43]: Who?

2170
03:14:42,513 --> 03:14:42,813
[SPEAKER_43]: Peter.

2171
03:14:43,314 --> 03:14:44,815
[SPEAKER_43]: Our Peter.

2172
03:14:45,375 --> 03:14:46,176
[SPEAKER_43]: Peter.

2173
03:14:48,338 --> 03:14:49,178
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

2174
03:14:49,819 --> 03:14:56,304
[SPEAKER_22]: I do think that from a purely public communications standpoint, I don't think it makes sense to

2175
03:15:00,449 --> 03:15:01,549
[SPEAKER_22]: make a decision on this tonight.

2176
03:15:01,629 --> 03:15:08,491
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, I'm on Zoom and I can see two, four, six, I can see 10 people with their hands up on Zoom still.

2177
03:15:08,531 --> 03:15:16,112
[SPEAKER_22]: So I don't think that it would be right to, uh, we, we want to have everyone have the chance to speak.

2178
03:15:16,232 --> 03:15:29,555
[SPEAKER_22]: And I do think the, the city kind of very aggressively promoted this meeting, but I, it is a balance to strike between the people who have been with us on this for the last few months and the people who just found out.

2179
03:15:30,184 --> 03:15:49,516
[SPEAKER_22]: And I do think I like Ben's idea of setting a date that is maybe not next week, maybe not three weeks from now, but a firm date that we will discuss it on this night.

2180
03:15:52,178 --> 03:15:59,222
[SPEAKER_22]: And I don't really know where I'm going with that, but I do like Ben's idea of we will discuss it on this date, because I do

2181
03:16:00,053 --> 03:16:16,238
[SPEAKER_22]: feel like public comment and public input is good, but we can't be chasing hours worth of public comment for the next six months and not really be sure of when this is going to move forward.

2182
03:16:16,258 --> 03:16:17,438
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that would do.

2183
03:16:17,458 --> 03:16:29,022
[SPEAKER_22]: We do have to balance getting public input with doing the work that we've been set, we've been appointed to do at some point.

2184
03:16:32,233 --> 03:16:34,714
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry, that is also my end of the evening rambling.

2185
03:16:34,794 --> 03:16:36,294
[SPEAKER_22]: It's that didn't make sense.

2186
03:16:36,334 --> 03:16:36,794
[SPEAKER_22]: I apologize.

2187
03:16:38,195 --> 03:16:38,635
[SPEAKER_35]: No, I'm not.

2188
03:16:38,675 --> 03:16:40,215
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm sure if I put them down.

2189
03:16:40,475 --> 03:16:40,615
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah.

2190
03:16:40,715 --> 03:16:42,476
[SPEAKER_35]: Ari, if I can.

2191
03:16:42,656 --> 03:16:42,916
[SPEAKER_35]: Yes.

2192
03:16:43,256 --> 03:16:51,898
[SPEAKER_35]: And that I think that the clear project management and a clear timeline, I think, hits both the needs of us to be able to deliberate, receive input.

2193
03:16:52,392 --> 03:17:02,395
[SPEAKER_35]: innocent associates, and most importantly, the public, to be able to contribute substantively and hear feedback and collaboratively participate.

2194
03:17:02,475 --> 03:17:06,457
[SPEAKER_35]: I don't think that the date we should set should be a single discussion in the future.

2195
03:17:06,497 --> 03:17:15,640
[SPEAKER_35]: I think we should set multiple dates, three or four of them, and have a clear deadline by which we will have hit all the major topics.

2196
03:17:17,361 --> 03:17:21,182
[SPEAKER_35]: And that way we can, you know, argue for two hours about

2197
03:17:22,848 --> 03:17:28,632
[SPEAKER_35]: West Medford Square or kind of be able to actually dive into the nuances.

2198
03:17:29,713 --> 03:17:36,597
[SPEAKER_35]: I think that will create a stronger proposal and in many ways will be more accessible as well.

2199
03:17:37,758 --> 03:17:37,958
Thank you.

2200
03:17:39,519 --> 03:17:41,741
[SPEAKER_42]: I think Ari, you bring up a good point because

2201
03:17:43,293 --> 03:17:51,559
[SPEAKER_42]: You bring up a good topic because right now we're talking about the ADUs as well as the neighborhood residential urban residential.

2202
03:17:54,121 --> 03:17:57,763
[SPEAKER_42]: The way the other squares were introduced, like those could be voted on separately.

2203
03:17:57,783 --> 03:17:59,785
[SPEAKER_42]: Correct?

2204
03:18:02,507 --> 03:18:03,908
[SPEAKER_42]: ADUs can be voted on separately.

2205
03:18:03,928 --> 03:18:07,170
[SPEAKER_42]: The squares can be voted on separately.

2206
03:18:07,730 --> 03:18:09,972
[SPEAKER_41]: So do you want me to share this board?

2207
03:18:12,548 --> 03:18:19,232
[SPEAKER_41]: If we did do the thing that Alicia asked about, which we will share with the public shortly, how much time would you need?

2208
03:18:32,440 --> 03:18:33,981
[SPEAKER_42]: Is it like a month delta good?

2209
03:18:34,001 --> 03:18:36,923
[SPEAKER_25]: I think a month delta would be fine.

2210
03:18:38,745 --> 03:18:40,386
[SPEAKER_25]: I think that would work for the public comment.

2211
03:18:40,426 --> 03:18:40,666
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

2212
03:18:41,106 --> 03:18:41,446
[SPEAKER_42]: OK.

2213
03:18:41,486 --> 03:18:53,315
[SPEAKER_42]: So what we're thinking about is, because it's clear that people want to continue to comment, we want to continue to hear it, is we will continue to accept public comment to a specific date.

2214
03:18:54,075 --> 03:19:01,221
[SPEAKER_42]: And then we will continue the topics, the NRUR to a date certain.

2215
03:19:02,472 --> 03:19:02,632
[SPEAKER_42]: Um.

2216
03:19:04,715 --> 03:19:13,305
[SPEAKER_42]: I don't know that we want to continue all those topics because we may be able to make progress on, um, Medford Square West Medford.

2217
03:19:13,325 --> 03:19:15,848
[SPEAKER_42]: In the meantime, kind of do those is like.

2218
03:19:17,811 --> 03:19:23,853
[SPEAKER_42]: Going back to my commercial real estate experience, those are almost like our anchor tenants of Medford.

2219
03:19:23,873 --> 03:19:31,896
[SPEAKER_42]: And then everything else is kind of supporting and kind of flowing out from the decisions that we make in those areas.

2220
03:19:32,576 --> 03:19:34,597
[SPEAKER_40]: Yeah, I'd agree.

2221
03:19:35,537 --> 03:19:42,600
[SPEAKER_49]: You're sort of talking about a divide and conquer strategy, which I think might be really good to knock off some of the easier pieces.

2222
03:19:44,460 --> 03:19:46,441
[SPEAKER_49]: Easier, yeah, relatively easier.

2223
03:19:47,667 --> 03:19:51,969
[SPEAKER_49]: When you get into the residential, I think there's kind of two ways to look at it.

2224
03:19:52,229 --> 03:19:58,252
[SPEAKER_49]: One is specific problems, such as the historical conversions.

2225
03:19:58,312 --> 03:19:59,472
[SPEAKER_49]: What does that really mean?

2226
03:20:01,393 --> 03:20:08,757
[SPEAKER_49]: Another way to look at it is neighborhood by neighborhood, because it's clear that our neighborhoods are radically different.

2227
03:20:09,437 --> 03:20:14,399
[SPEAKER_49]: North Medford, West Medford, South Medford, the list goes on and on.

2228
03:20:14,439 --> 03:20:16,040
[SPEAKER_49]: They each have their own character.

2229
03:20:16,932 --> 03:20:18,413
[SPEAKER_49]: and concerns.

2230
03:20:21,475 --> 03:20:22,836
[SPEAKER_49]: That's another way to look at it.

2231
03:20:25,318 --> 03:20:26,359
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah, thank you for that, John.

2232
03:20:26,379 --> 03:20:34,865
[SPEAKER_42]: Ari, I see your hand, but I also heard that Adam might have their hand.

2233
03:20:34,885 --> 03:20:36,166
[SPEAKER_42]: I don't know who wants to speak first.

2234
03:20:38,367 --> 03:20:39,708
[SPEAKER_42]: Ari, I think your hand was up first.

2235
03:20:40,789 --> 03:20:41,469
[SPEAKER_35]: Oh, sure.

2236
03:20:41,609 --> 03:20:42,790
[SPEAKER_35]: It's a short one.

2237
03:20:42,810 --> 03:20:44,692
[SPEAKER_35]: I think we're approaching

2238
03:20:45,730 --> 03:21:01,137
[SPEAKER_35]: good plan and I just wanted to throw in before I suggest or before I forget, in the next round, I would love to see a concrete proposal for some sort of tree protection for mature trees in the development.

2239
03:21:01,197 --> 03:21:03,959
[SPEAKER_35]: I know that was brought up and that's something that I've also been interested in.

2240
03:21:04,139 --> 03:21:04,999
[SPEAKER_35]: So just flagging it.

2241
03:21:06,460 --> 03:21:08,421
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah, we heard that from the public as well this evening.

2242
03:21:08,541 --> 03:21:10,222
[SPEAKER_42]: So thank you for calling that out, Adam.

2243
03:21:12,888 --> 03:21:14,769
[SPEAKER_36]: Yeah, I just want to reiterate what folks have said.

2244
03:21:14,829 --> 03:21:34,103
[SPEAKER_36]: And then maybe the other piece that at least I have heard, and maybe I'm just hearing what I want to hear, is just that the complexity of this is very hard to really wrap your head around, especially if you haven't had the time to sit with it consistently.

2245
03:21:35,344 --> 03:21:44,670
[SPEAKER_36]: Like, we have and so when you're the public and you hear that, you know, uh, your neighborhoods getting rezoned, there's just a lot of information that you have to have to wrap your head around.

2246
03:21:45,791 --> 03:21:50,714
[SPEAKER_36]: And so I'm just wondering if there's something from the board's perspective that from, like, a.

2247
03:21:51,535 --> 03:22:07,660
[SPEAKER_36]: principle that we can kind of anchor to around trying to drive recommendations towards more simplicity that just help maybe streamline both like the decision making that we can do and then also the just the understanding of the changes that are happening.

2248
03:22:07,920 --> 03:22:18,390
[SPEAKER_36]: I feel like with each recommendation, it's adding an additional layer of complexity that then makes it harder to understand the full scope of what's being proposed.

2249
03:22:20,592 --> 03:22:24,275
[SPEAKER_36]: So I just wanted to add that particular angle.

2250
03:22:25,740 --> 03:22:28,741
[SPEAKER_42]: And I also think there's interim communication that we can have with the public.

2251
03:22:28,761 --> 03:22:33,203
[SPEAKER_42]: You know, I'm looking at the FAQs on the zoning website, and there's two of them.

2252
03:22:33,623 --> 03:22:41,565
[SPEAKER_42]: But I think we're hearing a lot of questions from the public that maybe we can, you know, post in that forum.

2253
03:22:42,826 --> 03:22:45,667
[SPEAKER_42]: Specifically, like, you know, some of the questions we heard again and again tonight.

2254
03:22:46,707 --> 03:22:48,208
[SPEAKER_42]: You know, I heard about public services.

2255
03:22:48,268 --> 03:22:50,228
[SPEAKER_42]: I heard about parking.

2256
03:22:50,268 --> 03:22:54,390
[SPEAKER_42]: I heard about... I need to read my own handwriting right now.

2257
03:22:56,221 --> 03:22:58,704
[SPEAKER_42]: But yeah, I think there's ways we can communicate in an interim.

2258
03:22:58,744 --> 03:23:04,072
[SPEAKER_42]: So what I'm going to do, because I think we're all kind of circling the same idea, is start throwing out some dates.

2259
03:23:04,933 --> 03:23:11,662
[SPEAKER_42]: So we have meetings over the summer, but I hesitate to

2260
03:23:13,723 --> 03:23:18,288
[SPEAKER_42]: I hesitate to schedule things over the summer because of unavailability of the public as well as the board.

2261
03:23:18,849 --> 03:23:28,641
[SPEAKER_42]: So gut reactions to September 3rd, September 17th, and maybe it's this kind of like stepped meeting that we think about.

2262
03:23:28,821 --> 03:23:30,383
[SPEAKER_35]: I think that's waiting too long.

2263
03:23:31,965 --> 03:23:33,707
[SPEAKER_32]: can I just ask for some clarification?

2264
03:23:34,107 --> 03:23:49,681
[SPEAKER_32]: Are what we talking about is that you would, and I think what I'm recommending is something that we haven't really done much in Medford, but I have seen it in other communities where you say we're taking public comment in written comment until a certain date, like that could be July 20th or July 30th.

2265
03:23:51,823 --> 03:24:14,851
[SPEAKER_32]: And then the board meets again september 3rd and there will be no public comment that by that time the consultants have digested that the board will have read everything that has come in And that meeting is about deliberating and making recommendations Yeah, so my september dates, um are establishing the date which we'll discuss and then we would back out of that You know x number of weeks

2266
03:24:16,031 --> 03:24:18,093
[SPEAKER_42]: That you need to cover the comments.

2267
03:24:18,373 --> 03:24:42,513
[SPEAKER_42]: So if we and you know, I hear your feedback ari on, you know, that's way too far out So i'm i'm not ignoring that i'm just using the dates that I already threw out So if we did meet september 3rd, and that was kind of the next big discussion post public comment You know, maybe the public comment is due august 3rd or august 15th I would go earlier than that to give us time to really work out Okay, so more than a month

2268
03:24:46,562 --> 03:24:49,163
[SPEAKER_25]: Just note that you would have to continue this to a date certain.

2269
03:24:49,463 --> 03:24:49,963
[SPEAKER_42]: Right, yes.

2270
03:24:49,983 --> 03:24:50,503
[SPEAKER_25]: So yeah.

2271
03:24:51,003 --> 03:24:55,784
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah, so if we continue it to September 3rd, we would say comments are due by August 3rd.

2272
03:24:55,804 --> 03:24:55,984
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah.

2273
03:24:56,124 --> 03:24:58,525
[SPEAKER_42]: But I think as a board, we might not be aligned on that.

2274
03:24:58,565 --> 03:25:01,306
[SPEAKER_42]: So I don't want anyone to write those dates in their diary right now.

2275
03:25:02,466 --> 03:25:09,588
[SPEAKER_42]: So I hear from a board member, Ari, that September is too far out.

2276
03:25:09,608 --> 03:25:12,248
[SPEAKER_42]: Do we have any counter proposals?

2277
03:25:13,409 --> 03:25:13,769
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm sorry.

2278
03:25:15,026 --> 03:25:17,607
[SPEAKER_35]: Um, I'm happy to kind of add some more detail to that.

2279
03:25:17,647 --> 03:25:17,907
[SPEAKER_35]: Sorry.

2280
03:25:17,927 --> 03:25:19,368
[SPEAKER_35]: I had a very gut reaction.

2281
03:25:19,388 --> 03:25:21,789
[SPEAKER_42]: Um, yeah, no, that's, that's valid.

2282
03:25:21,809 --> 03:25:21,989
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah.

2283
03:25:23,369 --> 03:25:29,212
[SPEAKER_35]: Um, I think another like 3 to 4 weeks for public comment from this point is reasonable.

2284
03:25:29,532 --> 03:25:37,235
[SPEAKER_35]: And I do want to make sure that we build in, in the backwards planning at least a month of, um, iteration.

2285
03:25:38,082 --> 03:25:49,804
[SPEAKER_35]: I don't think we're going to approve the 1st thing we discuss kind of, and nor do I think we'll be able to discuss the whole thing in 1. so I think if anything kind of.

2286
03:25:51,052 --> 03:26:02,058
[SPEAKER_35]: I think another 3 to 4 weeks for comment max and then planning on, like, at least 2 to 3 iterations or kind of sub segments feels more realistic.

2287
03:26:03,359 --> 03:26:08,122
[SPEAKER_35]: And I will also be realistic about the fact that I will not be able to join meetings in September.

2288
03:26:08,222 --> 03:26:10,343
[SPEAKER_35]: So feel free to schedule without me.

2289
03:26:13,869 --> 03:26:14,730
[SPEAKER_42]: miss you terribly.

2290
03:26:14,750 --> 03:26:16,912
[SPEAKER_42]: Um okay.

2291
03:26:16,932 --> 03:26:19,995
[SPEAKER_42]: So yeah, if we do the 3 to 4 weeks, that brings us to July 16th.

2292
03:26:20,495 --> 03:26:25,399
[SPEAKER_42]: If we have a month of iteration, that brings us to middle of August.

2293
03:26:25,720 --> 03:26:28,522
[SPEAKER_42]: Our meetings in August, I believe, are scheduled for the 6th and 20th.

2294
03:26:28,542 --> 03:26:29,983
[SPEAKER_42]: The 20th is the closest.

2295
03:26:30,844 --> 03:26:30,944
[SPEAKER_42]: Um

2296
03:26:32,233 --> 03:26:36,776
[SPEAKER_42]: So we're two weeks delta from the date that I suggested in September.

2297
03:26:36,796 --> 03:26:38,357
[SPEAKER_49]: A quick question.

2298
03:26:38,578 --> 03:26:38,778
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah.

2299
03:26:39,538 --> 03:26:41,560
[SPEAKER_49]: Are you just talking about residential?

2300
03:26:41,580 --> 03:26:41,640
[SPEAKER_49]: Yes.

2301
03:26:42,180 --> 03:26:43,501
[SPEAKER_49]: Or are you talking about everything?

2302
03:26:43,881 --> 03:26:47,864
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm just talking about neighborhood residential, urban residential.

2303
03:26:48,485 --> 03:26:51,127
[SPEAKER_42]: I think the other topics we can continue to hear and discuss.

2304
03:26:53,568 --> 03:26:55,190
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

2305
03:26:55,650 --> 03:26:56,771
[SPEAKER_22]: That's what I was going to bring up.

2306
03:26:56,891 --> 03:26:59,333
[SPEAKER_22]: I wanted to bring up that I do think

2307
03:27:00,499 --> 03:27:07,521
[SPEAKER_22]: There is complexity to the residential zoning, but I don't think that means that everything else should stand still.

2308
03:27:08,501 --> 03:27:19,964
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that there, particularly with the squares in the corridors, there are things that can be considered that may even contribute to clarity around the residential zoning as those get done.

2309
03:27:21,145 --> 03:27:23,985
[SPEAKER_22]: So I don't think we want this to hold up the whole thing.

2310
03:27:24,005 --> 03:27:25,926
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think if there's,

2311
03:27:27,867 --> 03:27:42,337
[SPEAKER_22]: if it is possible that if there's stuff prepared for the squares and corridors, which I believe is most of what's left, that we should continue hearing that, I think.

2312
03:27:44,019 --> 03:27:44,539
[SPEAKER_22]: That's my thought.

2313
03:27:46,460 --> 03:27:47,021
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah, I agree.

2314
03:27:48,855 --> 03:27:50,436
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm not sure.

2315
03:27:50,936 --> 03:28:01,282
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm not sure I follow the distinction, frankly, but like, you know, we would we would potentially vote on squares and corridors sooner and then.

2316
03:28:01,302 --> 03:28:06,425
[SPEAKER_37]: Eight certain further than that for the overall zoning changes.

2317
03:28:06,485 --> 03:28:08,686
[SPEAKER_37]: I mean, that seems reasonable to me.

2318
03:28:08,927 --> 03:28:11,068
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah, those topics were introduced as like separate.

2319
03:28:11,128 --> 03:28:13,109
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah, yeah, that seems reasonable to me.

2320
03:28:13,149 --> 03:28:14,750
[SPEAKER_37]: I mean, I would propose, though, that.

2321
03:28:16,360 --> 03:28:31,527
[SPEAKER_37]: we're making a set of changes that are going to set the foundation for this city for the next 30 years, that an extra month to make sure we get it right, even if that means we push to October so that Ari can be there.

2322
03:28:34,368 --> 03:28:44,873
[SPEAKER_37]: Like, I just don't see the benefit of trying to squeeze this in while everybody's on their end of summer vacation before Labor Day, just because we want to save a month.

2323
03:28:51,360 --> 03:28:52,000
[SPEAKER_43]: Yeah, no, I agree with you.

2324
03:28:52,020 --> 03:28:54,221
[SPEAKER_37]: So if we can find discrete, sorry, just I'll wrap up.

2325
03:28:54,381 --> 03:29:07,303
[SPEAKER_37]: If we can find discrete things to make progress on that we feel the public comment has been fully digested and incorporated, and maybe that's Medford Square or something like that, sure, let's knock it out.

2326
03:29:07,523 --> 03:29:11,284
[SPEAKER_37]: But I would say, let's choose a date.

2327
03:29:11,324 --> 03:29:18,425
[SPEAKER_37]: Let's give ourselves more time rather than rush it on the big sweeping zoning changes for the city.

2328
03:29:20,022 --> 03:29:20,802
[SPEAKER_42]: I could not agree more.

2329
03:29:20,822 --> 03:29:26,264
[SPEAKER_42]: And yeah, I mean, what's the saying?

2330
03:29:26,884 --> 03:29:29,705
[SPEAKER_42]: The days are long, or was it the days are long?

2331
03:29:29,745 --> 03:29:30,965
[SPEAKER_42]: Short, but the years are long.

2332
03:29:31,465 --> 03:29:32,305
[SPEAKER_42]: No, I think it's the other way.

2333
03:29:33,066 --> 03:29:34,906
[SPEAKER_42]: The days are long, the years are short.

2334
03:29:34,926 --> 03:29:39,007
[SPEAKER_37]: 10 years from now, nobody will remember whether it was like the summer of 2025 or the fall of 2025.

2335
03:29:39,047 --> 03:29:40,788
[SPEAKER_37]: They'll remember if we get it right.

2336
03:29:40,808 --> 03:29:40,968
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah.

2337
03:29:40,988 --> 03:29:41,468
[SPEAKER_37]: So let's talk.

2338
03:29:52,952 --> 03:29:54,293
[SPEAKER_42]: Do you have a point of information?

2339
03:29:54,313 --> 03:29:58,257
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay, would you mind feeding it to our?

2340
03:29:59,118 --> 03:30:03,483
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah, that's a question.

2341
03:30:04,644 --> 03:30:05,024
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you.

2342
03:30:05,044 --> 03:30:10,290
[SPEAKER_41]: I do want to make sure we don't lose sight of the fact that the Medford Square, that's Medford Square.

2343
03:30:29,904 --> 03:30:30,144
[SPEAKER_43]: Ari?

2344
03:30:33,006 --> 03:30:33,266
[SPEAKER_43]: Yes.

2345
03:30:34,327 --> 03:30:35,127
[SPEAKER_43]: Yep.

2346
03:30:35,628 --> 03:30:36,128
[SPEAKER_32]: What about me?

2347
03:30:38,990 --> 03:30:39,970
[SPEAKER_32]: Your hand is up.

2348
03:30:41,571 --> 03:30:43,112
[SPEAKER_35]: It was not meant to be, apologies.

2349
03:30:44,593 --> 03:30:45,253
[SPEAKER_42]: No, you're good.

2350
03:30:45,273 --> 03:30:46,374
[SPEAKER_42]: The joys of hybrid meetings.

2351
03:30:46,454 --> 03:30:47,975
[SPEAKER_42]: Peter, your hand is up.

2352
03:30:48,996 --> 03:30:49,296
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

2353
03:30:50,496 --> 03:30:51,317
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, that was intentional.

2354
03:30:52,498 --> 03:30:59,342
[SPEAKER_22]: I just wanted to just say if we're waiting

2355
03:31:00,242 --> 03:31:09,948
[SPEAKER_22]: If we're scheduling things out, I want to make sure it's around timelines that make sense for people.

2356
03:31:10,028 --> 03:31:24,097
[SPEAKER_22]: Give people time, but also not, I don't know, I don't want to wait for the, I don't want to give everybody time to contribute as they want to, but not wait for the sake of winning.

2357
03:31:24,958 --> 03:31:28,340
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, I agree that we want to do it right, but if there's

2358
03:31:29,328 --> 03:31:31,110
[SPEAKER_22]: If we can act on things, I want to make sure we do.

2359
03:31:39,437 --> 03:31:40,058
[SPEAKER_35]: Strongly agree.

2360
03:31:45,903 --> 03:31:47,424
[SPEAKER_42]: So where does that bring us in terms of dates?

2361
03:31:47,444 --> 03:31:52,448
[SPEAKER_42]: I know, Ari, you said you're not present in September.

2362
03:31:55,488 --> 03:31:59,549
[SPEAKER_42]: I won't be around on the 20th of August.

2363
03:32:02,230 --> 03:32:05,071
[SPEAKER_42]: Is September 17th a good date to work off of?

2364
03:32:05,691 --> 03:32:13,653
[SPEAKER_42]: I know it did get the gut reaction of too far out, but I think on further socialization, like September might be reasonable.

2365
03:32:17,855 --> 03:32:20,896
[SPEAKER_42]: I know you guys aren't commenting anymore, but I do appreciate the nods.

2366
03:32:22,376 --> 03:32:22,736
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

2367
03:32:23,576 --> 03:32:27,537
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay, so if we have the 17th is when we are continuing this to a date certain.

2368
03:32:27,917 --> 03:32:32,778
[SPEAKER_42]: And this might be a two-part discussion to kind of reference what you said just to help manage expectations.

2369
03:32:33,938 --> 03:32:36,959
[SPEAKER_42]: And we do a month before for comments due.

2370
03:32:38,179 --> 03:32:39,340
[SPEAKER_42]: That would bring us to 8-17.

2371
03:32:39,360 --> 03:32:42,480
[SPEAKER_42]: So yeah, that's...

2372
03:32:47,521 --> 03:32:51,202
[SPEAKER_42]: That's a ton of time, hopefully, for all the comments to be incorporated.

2373
03:32:51,222 --> 03:32:54,803
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

2374
03:33:03,445 --> 03:33:04,146
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm so sorry.

2375
03:33:04,226 --> 03:33:06,546
[SPEAKER_40]: If you have a question.

2376
03:33:20,434 --> 03:33:21,394
[SPEAKER_42]: I appreciate your question.

2377
03:33:21,455 --> 03:33:24,257
[SPEAKER_42]: If you do have questions like that, just go to Christian and he'll clarify.

2378
03:33:24,297 --> 03:33:26,519
[SPEAKER_42]: But since you asked, I will answer.

2379
03:33:27,900 --> 03:33:30,623
[SPEAKER_42]: The comments can be in any form that you would like to share.

2380
03:33:31,704 --> 03:33:34,747
[SPEAKER_42]: We take all comments equally, whether they are... No, no, no.

2381
03:33:35,267 --> 03:33:36,948
[SPEAKER_32]: You have to take written comments.

2382
03:33:37,168 --> 03:33:40,770
[SPEAKER_32]: You cannot call the office and leave comments.

2383
03:33:41,170 --> 03:33:45,913
[SPEAKER_32]: So we're not talking about having a forum for people to make verbal comments.

2384
03:33:46,273 --> 03:33:49,395
[SPEAKER_32]: They're talking about having written comments that you would submit.

2385
03:33:49,915 --> 03:33:53,077
[SPEAKER_32]: And the other question that we've been getting is about questions.

2386
03:33:53,637 --> 03:33:57,940
[SPEAKER_32]: So we'll have staff at Circle the Square this Saturday from three to seven.

2387
03:33:58,580 --> 03:34:00,301
[SPEAKER_32]: and we can answer questions there.

2388
03:34:00,701 --> 03:34:06,123
[SPEAKER_32]: And we will have papers there for people to leave written comments that we can then submit to the board for you.

2389
03:34:07,803 --> 03:34:13,625
[SPEAKER_32]: And if people have specific questions and not the esoteric, like, why didn't you do a study?

2390
03:34:13,645 --> 03:34:15,826
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm not responding to that via email.

2391
03:34:15,866 --> 03:34:26,070
[SPEAKER_32]: That's not a useful, but if you say, what is the zoning on my street that we can answer, we can talk to you about, and the staff can field those via email over the next several weeks.

2392
03:34:26,510 --> 03:34:36,155
[SPEAKER_32]: and if we've not been able to keep up with the flood that comes in when we get 40 in like 48 hours, but over the next several weeks, we can answer questions as they come in.

2393
03:34:36,876 --> 03:34:40,818
[SPEAKER_32]: Just to be clear, the board would then take written comment during the summer.

2394
03:34:40,838 --> 03:34:43,619
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes, thank you for that clarification, Alicia.

2395
03:34:43,639 --> 03:34:50,723
[SPEAKER_42]: It's getting late in the hour, so I misspoke, but comments from the public would be written.

2396
03:34:51,950 --> 03:34:55,212
[SPEAKER_42]: So hopefully that eases childcare burdens, life burdens.

2397
03:34:55,572 --> 03:34:59,494
[SPEAKER_42]: If you do have questions, please refer to Christian.

2398
03:35:02,816 --> 03:35:07,158
[SPEAKER_42]: But I do appreciate people rearranging their lives and their times and making space for this.

2399
03:35:08,839 --> 03:35:13,601
[SPEAKER_42]: So to get back to those specific dates, we talked about September 17th.

2400
03:35:13,621 --> 03:35:13,721
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes.

2401
03:35:22,298 --> 03:35:22,518
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah.

2402
03:35:25,680 --> 03:35:30,342
[SPEAKER_42]: Honestly, yeah, it could have been a Monday night, given my brain right now.

2403
03:35:30,702 --> 03:35:30,902
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay.

2404
03:35:30,922 --> 03:35:36,305
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah, because that is the, we have our meetings on the first and third Wednesday of every month.

2405
03:35:36,565 --> 03:35:37,786
[SPEAKER_42]: So that's the third Wednesday.

2406
03:35:40,087 --> 03:35:45,609
[SPEAKER_42]: So we would have maybe the first of potentially two discussions.

2407
03:35:45,709 --> 03:35:50,132
[SPEAKER_42]: So it could be September 17th, if needed, continue to October 1st.

2408
03:35:51,878 --> 03:35:52,118
[SPEAKER_42]: Um.

2409
03:35:53,459 --> 03:36:00,023
[SPEAKER_42]: And then we would want written public comment just to be as clear as possible written public comment.

2410
03:36:02,924 --> 03:36:04,145
[SPEAKER_42]: Let's say by August 13th.

2411
03:36:18,727 --> 03:36:25,096
[SPEAKER_35]: I think we can do initial public comment much sooner than that on what is existing.

2412
03:36:25,156 --> 03:36:28,501
[SPEAKER_35]: I think what we need to build in more time for is the iteration.

2413
03:36:28,521 --> 03:36:34,810
[SPEAKER_35]: I think it would be actually much more helpful to have initial public comment due at some point in July.

2414
03:36:35,343 --> 03:36:43,935
[SPEAKER_35]: And then commit to having a new proposal that incorporates that and have an additional 2 weeks for public comment.

2415
03:36:44,816 --> 03:36:50,905
[SPEAKER_35]: And edit and then another week or so for that last iteration, I think that.

2416
03:36:51,745 --> 03:36:58,848
[SPEAKER_35]: what I'm hearing is admittedly the very traditional way we have done this, which is we receive comment and then we incorporate it.

2417
03:36:59,568 --> 03:37:07,452
[SPEAKER_35]: But what I think I am hearing and what I think does strengthen the city as a whole is when we're able to do more rounds of that iteration.

2418
03:37:07,732 --> 03:37:10,153
[SPEAKER_35]: And we are allowing ourselves that time.

2419
03:37:10,413 --> 03:37:12,454
[SPEAKER_35]: So let's use it to its maximum potential.

2420
03:37:14,274 --> 03:37:16,675
[SPEAKER_42]: You took the words out of my brain that I couldn't find.

2421
03:37:16,815 --> 03:37:18,016
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you so much for that, Ari.

2422
03:37:18,616 --> 03:37:20,297
[SPEAKER_42]: So if we have

2423
03:37:22,083 --> 03:37:31,627
[SPEAKER_42]: public comment, public written comment, let's say July 16th, that gives another, that gives two months for iterations.

2424
03:37:33,308 --> 03:37:34,449
[SPEAKER_42]: How does that sound to the board?

2425
03:37:34,469 --> 03:37:36,870
[SPEAKER_22]: I like that a lot.

2426
03:37:37,250 --> 03:37:40,031
[SPEAKER_22]: I think I tend to agree with Ari.

2427
03:37:40,531 --> 03:37:48,055
[SPEAKER_22]: We should allow time once we have received the public written comment for NS Associates to work on that and then for

2428
03:37:49,538 --> 03:37:53,120
[SPEAKER_42]: So Peter, just to be super direct, what date would you propose?

2429
03:37:53,140 --> 03:38:18,970
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh no, I like the July 16th, and then presumably the first meeting being, just based on what we were just talking about, the first meeting on this being September 3rd, or August 17th, and then with the potential to continuance to the 3rd if needed, is what I was hearing.

2430
03:38:21,202 --> 03:38:27,526
[SPEAKER_42]: So recognizing this late hour, if you support it, great.

2431
03:38:27,706 --> 03:38:30,348
[SPEAKER_42]: If you don't support it, say something.

2432
03:38:31,128 --> 03:38:31,989
[SPEAKER_42]: We're gonna continue.

2433
03:38:34,810 --> 03:38:39,934
[SPEAKER_42]: We eventually need a motion, but I think what we're discussing as a board is continue to September 17th.

2434
03:38:41,014 --> 03:38:44,196
[SPEAKER_42]: And we're going to accept written public comment until July 16th.

2435
03:38:46,418 --> 03:38:49,144
[SPEAKER_42]: Do any board members have any objections to those?

2436
03:38:49,666 --> 03:38:50,407
[SPEAKER_25]: Madam chair.

2437
03:38:52,031 --> 03:38:52,292
[SPEAKER_25]: Sorry.

2438
03:38:53,063 --> 03:38:53,684
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes, Emily.

2439
03:38:54,524 --> 03:39:01,289
[SPEAKER_25]: So you're going to continue the discussion of this topic to September 17th.

2440
03:39:02,110 --> 03:39:06,953
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm not sure that allows you to talk about it before September 17th.

2441
03:39:07,674 --> 03:39:12,117
[SPEAKER_25]: So I just wanted to clarify that because there was some talk of some iterations over the summer.

2442
03:39:12,557 --> 03:39:20,663
[SPEAKER_25]: I think from my perspective, it would be fabulous to have the comments early, but then my understanding is that

2443
03:39:21,183 --> 03:39:27,408
[SPEAKER_25]: we would be doing work responding to it, working with city staff to come back to September 17th.

2444
03:39:27,568 --> 03:39:33,593
[SPEAKER_25]: If you continue this topic to September 17th, you can't be discussing it in August.

2445
03:39:33,633 --> 03:39:34,894
[SPEAKER_15]: You're right, with open meeting law.

2446
03:39:34,974 --> 03:39:38,036
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for highlighting that.

2447
03:39:39,037 --> 03:39:40,298
[SPEAKER_15]: Can we continue to mid-August?

2448
03:39:41,199 --> 03:39:41,579
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, sorry.

2449
03:39:44,283 --> 03:39:46,084
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, that already took the words out of my mouth.

2450
03:39:46,104 --> 03:39:47,025
[SPEAKER_22]: That was what I was about to say.

2451
03:39:47,245 --> 03:39:56,030
[SPEAKER_22]: I was under the impression based on the due date of the comments that we would be continuing to whatever that teens in August meeting is.

2452
03:39:56,771 --> 03:40:03,054
[SPEAKER_22]: And then with the ability to continue it into September after we see the updated proposal.

2453
03:40:03,495 --> 03:40:05,336
[SPEAKER_22]: That was my understanding of what we were discussing.

2454
03:40:06,297 --> 03:40:09,199
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay, so our August meetings are the 6th and the 20th.

2455
03:40:09,299 --> 03:40:13,682
[SPEAKER_42]: I will not be here on the 20th, but we have a second meeting I've missed this year.

2456
03:40:13,843 --> 03:40:15,764
[SPEAKER_42]: So apologies for the timing on that.

2457
03:40:16,404 --> 03:40:20,147
[SPEAKER_42]: Our September meetings are the 3rd and the 17th.

2458
03:40:20,167 --> 03:40:29,414
[SPEAKER_42]: We can of course call special meetings to meet outside of our 1st and 3rd schedule, which is to give an idea for the cadence that we could have.

2459
03:40:30,955 --> 03:40:35,078
[SPEAKER_22]: I would say based on the timeline we kind of want to set,

2460
03:40:35,910 --> 03:40:48,193
[SPEAKER_22]: to, unless there's a very strong objection, continue to August 20.

2461
03:40:49,813 --> 03:40:54,755
[SPEAKER_22]: I know, Emily, you can't be there, but I'm just kind of throwing that timeline out there.

2462
03:40:54,775 --> 03:40:56,035
[SPEAKER_43]: Yeah.

2463
03:40:56,935 --> 03:41:00,536
[SPEAKER_22]: With then the potential to continue to September 3, if needed.

2464
03:41:02,116 --> 03:41:02,936
[SPEAKER_41]: Long for the time.

2465
03:41:03,077 --> 03:41:04,917
[SPEAKER_41]: I know all about it.

2466
03:41:06,159 --> 03:41:08,360
[SPEAKER_41]: I'm just one member of the board.

2467
03:41:08,400 --> 03:41:09,681
[SPEAKER_41]: How many Mullins have I had?

2468
03:41:09,701 --> 03:41:13,323
[SPEAKER_41]: I think I, if you had one, it's too many.

2469
03:41:13,623 --> 03:41:16,404
[SPEAKER_41]: Yeah, I think I'd be, I think I'd be suited.

2470
03:41:16,485 --> 03:41:28,931
[SPEAKER_32]: And we have to make sure that the members of the board who are eligible to vote on this are available because anybody who's had, who's already missed one meeting and had to do a Mullin affidavit can't miss another meeting.

2471
03:41:28,951 --> 03:41:31,372
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay, gotcha.

2472
03:41:31,692 --> 03:41:34,454
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah, so I'd be, I'd be scooted out.

2473
03:41:36,342 --> 03:41:49,424
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, that's the... I mean, the issue that presents, I think, is that then we'd... If we were to continue straight through to September 3rd, we'd then lose ARRI, if I'm understanding things correctly.

2474
03:41:51,233 --> 03:41:52,635
[SPEAKER_35]: Due date is August 25th.

2475
03:41:52,815 --> 03:41:56,398
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm gonna need some time off.

2476
03:41:56,458 --> 03:42:05,908
[SPEAKER_35]: We're kind of talking about whether it makes sense to have an alternate step in for me, but I don't know what that does with Mullen Act and having been present.

2477
03:42:06,108 --> 03:42:13,255
[SPEAKER_35]: But I will be realistic that for at least a month after a new human leaves my body, I'm out.

2478
03:42:13,275 --> 03:42:13,776
[SPEAKER_35]: That's very fair.

2479
03:42:14,705 --> 03:42:15,347
[SPEAKER_35]: That's very fair.

2480
03:42:15,468 --> 03:42:15,789
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay.

2481
03:42:16,511 --> 03:42:17,634
[SPEAKER_42]: What if we move the public?

2482
03:42:17,795 --> 03:42:19,961
[SPEAKER_42]: Because we've already gotten a significant amount of comments.

2483
03:42:22,822 --> 03:42:28,026
[SPEAKER_42]: I just what I another point that I'm hearing is that there might be additional outreach that needs to be done.

2484
03:42:28,586 --> 03:42:31,228
[SPEAKER_42]: So yes, the public is going to share their comments with us.

2485
03:42:31,268 --> 03:42:41,476
[SPEAKER_42]: But I also think that the delta between now and public comment do there has to be some additional outreach for some some repetitive outreach.

2486
03:42:41,496 --> 03:42:49,863
[SPEAKER_42]: So that's that's what I'm floating around in terms of like our, um, like our initiation kind of for our

2487
03:42:51,490 --> 03:42:54,793
[SPEAKER_42]: our datum for picking the start date.

2488
03:42:55,353 --> 03:43:00,578
[SPEAKER_42]: Because I think the day that public comments are due starts the rest of this.

2489
03:43:01,738 --> 03:43:10,986
[SPEAKER_42]: And if we can't do the 20th, if we don't want to do September, then yeah, we're looking to October.

2490
03:43:15,189 --> 03:43:16,150
[SPEAKER_42]: Good things take time, Alicia.

2491
03:43:21,622 --> 03:43:24,684
[SPEAKER_42]: So how does the August 6th look for people?

2492
03:43:28,067 --> 03:43:28,367
[SPEAKER_42]: Sorry.

2493
03:43:32,170 --> 03:43:33,211
[SPEAKER_22]: No, I mean.

2494
03:43:33,391 --> 03:43:34,612
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll put a dollar in the swear jar.

2495
03:43:38,415 --> 03:43:44,280
[SPEAKER_22]: August 6th sounds fine in theory, as long as there's time for everything, at least to me.

2496
03:43:45,801 --> 03:43:50,405
[SPEAKER_22]: But I also don't want to shortchange any of if

2497
03:43:51,150 --> 03:43:52,631
[SPEAKER_22]: There's going to be work that needs to be done.

2498
03:43:52,651 --> 03:43:58,476
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, I think, is there a world in which we could get the information we need by August 6?

2499
03:43:58,836 --> 03:43:59,516
[SPEAKER_22]: I think so.

2500
03:43:59,757 --> 03:44:06,482
[SPEAKER_22]: But that's just my opinion of the timeline.

2501
03:44:06,502 --> 03:44:06,722
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry.

2502
03:44:07,983 --> 03:44:08,403
[SPEAKER_43]: Go on, Ari.

2503
03:44:16,101 --> 03:44:31,803
[SPEAKER_32]: I'd like to make the point that I think what could work is that if you had the public comment due by this date late in July, what the consultants, in order to give you an iteration, they actually need the members of the board to say, these are the things we'd like to see changed.

2504
03:44:32,304 --> 03:44:36,645
[SPEAKER_32]: because literally some of the public comments in direct conflict with each other.

2505
03:44:36,665 --> 03:44:41,626
[SPEAKER_32]: So you can't just take all the public comment and come out with a version because you literally can't.

2506
03:44:42,006 --> 03:44:43,406
[SPEAKER_32]: So the board needs to meet.

2507
03:44:43,566 --> 03:44:59,989
[SPEAKER_32]: And so my thought is that if the board could meet at some point in early-ish August and say, this is what we think we'd like to see change, and then expect that you'll come back and then we advertise that version to the public, but you're not taking public comments anymore.

2508
03:45:01,022 --> 03:45:04,483
[SPEAKER_32]: And then, which is a problem, but you're not, you've closed public comment.

2509
03:45:05,143 --> 03:45:13,465
[SPEAKER_32]: And then you're discussing it again in September and saying, this is what we have based on the version that the consultants have come back with.

2510
03:45:15,685 --> 03:45:17,146
[SPEAKER_32]: It's how do you give them direction?

2511
03:45:17,266 --> 03:45:17,786
[SPEAKER_32]: No, I know.

2512
03:45:20,666 --> 03:45:22,807
[SPEAKER_35]: I like the idea of that August meeting.

2513
03:45:22,847 --> 03:45:25,047
[SPEAKER_35]: I think that seems like a very reasonable timeline.

2514
03:45:25,087 --> 03:45:27,488
[SPEAKER_35]: The only thing about that that gives me substantial pause

2515
03:45:28,156 --> 03:45:30,820
[SPEAKER_35]: is not receiving that additional round of public feedback.

2516
03:45:30,860 --> 03:45:39,871
[SPEAKER_35]: I actually do really want the round of feedback after the iteration, and I don't know what the legal mechanism is, but I feel like there has to be one.

2517
03:45:39,891 --> 03:45:43,175
[SPEAKER_35]: But August 6th sounds reasonable to me.

2518
03:45:44,760 --> 03:45:54,107
[SPEAKER_25]: I think what you would want to do is to, and this is the point in the process at which I say I am not a lawyer, but I was a planning board member for 10 years.

2519
03:45:54,247 --> 03:46:08,940
[SPEAKER_25]: So just speaking from that experience, but not being a lawyer, I think you want to keep the public comment period open this whole time, but state that you're going to have a working meeting in August where you go through all the public comment that's received.

2520
03:46:10,061 --> 03:46:14,125
[SPEAKER_25]: you then give us some direction where we can come back with the iterations.

2521
03:46:14,745 --> 03:46:19,430
[SPEAKER_25]: You probably have another working meeting to understand the iterations and confirm that's what you expected.

2522
03:46:20,010 --> 03:46:28,938
[SPEAKER_25]: Keep the public hearing open, and then once we're all solid that we've done the iterations that you wanted to have the public comment on,

2523
03:46:29,839 --> 03:46:34,901
[SPEAKER_25]: let the public know that we're now having public comment on that set of iterations.

2524
03:46:34,981 --> 03:46:44,886
[SPEAKER_25]: I think one of the confusing things has been, for yourselves, for the public, frankly for ourselves, is we've been trying to iterate in real time, and I think that's gotten a lot of people confused.

2525
03:46:44,946 --> 03:46:55,230
[SPEAKER_25]: So if we can let people know, this is the iteration period, this is your comment period, this is our iteration for all of us on your comments, this is your comment that would work out very well.

2526
03:46:57,545 --> 03:46:58,706
[SPEAKER_32]: did I understand you?

2527
03:46:59,246 --> 03:47:09,195
[SPEAKER_32]: What I think I heard you saying, but not in so many words, is that you would actually announce that you'll have some working meetings where the board will discuss, but we'll not open it up to public comment.

2528
03:47:09,395 --> 03:47:13,559
[SPEAKER_32]: So residents may watch, but you won't be taking input during those meetings.

2529
03:47:14,660 --> 03:47:17,582
[SPEAKER_32]: But you could come back later and take public comment again.

2530
03:47:17,722 --> 03:47:20,244
[SPEAKER_32]: And we present kind of that first iteration.

2531
03:47:21,045 --> 03:47:24,088
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, my understanding is that

2532
03:47:25,442 --> 03:47:29,525
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll accept public comment on the current iteration through whatever date.

2533
03:47:30,445 --> 03:47:35,829
[SPEAKER_22]: Then we'll have our working meetings where we hash through things and don't accept public comment.

2534
03:47:35,869 --> 03:47:44,375
[SPEAKER_22]: And then we'll have the iterated version on which we will accept public comment again.

2535
03:47:44,395 --> 03:47:48,098
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah, I think I have the same understanding.

2536
03:47:48,958 --> 03:47:51,120
[SPEAKER_37]: Would it be helpful for me to give you dates?

2537
03:47:51,420 --> 03:47:52,981
[SPEAKER_37]: I've been looking at the calendar this whole time.

2538
03:47:53,400 --> 03:47:56,921
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah, I have a couple dates, but I would love to hear from not my voice.

2539
03:47:57,401 --> 03:48:02,282
[SPEAKER_37]: We do have a meeting on the calendar next week, right?

2540
03:48:02,443 --> 03:48:08,284
[SPEAKER_37]: So that's a continued public discussion week, not this one, okay.

2541
03:48:09,605 --> 03:48:13,386
[SPEAKER_37]: So then the next public discussion would be July 9th.

2542
03:48:14,366 --> 03:48:19,447
[SPEAKER_42]: So you're talking about reopening the hearing for verbal public comment?

2543
03:48:19,467 --> 03:48:21,228
[SPEAKER_42]: Because I think what we're talking about is,

2544
03:48:22,571 --> 03:48:25,353
[SPEAKER_37]: Are we saying no more verbal public comment after today?

2545
03:48:27,395 --> 03:48:31,317
[SPEAKER_37]: We had like 30 people who didn't get to speak today and a whole bunch of people who didn't know about it.

2546
03:48:32,418 --> 03:48:32,879
Yeah.

2547
03:48:33,359 --> 03:48:33,699
[SPEAKER_40]: Yeah.

2548
03:48:33,819 --> 03:48:38,703
[SPEAKER_40]: Respectfully, if you have comments, please email them.

2549
03:48:38,763 --> 03:48:41,265
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

2550
03:48:53,108 --> 03:48:55,289
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, we're making billions of dollars a decision.

2551
03:48:55,329 --> 03:48:56,289
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm so sorry.

2552
03:48:58,230 --> 03:49:04,451
[SPEAKER_42]: Public comment is closed for this meeting.

2553
03:49:05,472 --> 03:49:11,634
[SPEAKER_40]: Yeah, I just wanted that in my stash.

2554
03:49:12,554 --> 03:49:12,874
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

2555
03:49:16,200 --> 03:49:18,560
[SPEAKER_42]: you bring up a good point, Ben.

2556
03:49:19,441 --> 03:49:24,382
[SPEAKER_42]: We would be missing a lot of voices because there is this kind of like outreach question.

2557
03:49:25,822 --> 03:49:36,524
[SPEAKER_37]: Should we should we maybe just in the interest of I know not like not losing our minds, losing our minds right now.

2558
03:49:36,904 --> 03:49:41,145
[SPEAKER_37]: Maybe we use next week's meeting to just finalize the logistics.

2559
03:49:42,025 --> 03:49:45,606
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah, I mean, I'm of the opinion that we should probably continue to have

2560
03:49:46,231 --> 03:49:46,771
[SPEAKER_37]: the board wants to see.

2561
03:49:47,111 --> 03:49:57,214
[SPEAKER_37]: We're not, you know, public comment period is technically still open, but we're not going to take it at these next two meetings because the board's going to deliberate.

2562
03:49:57,574 --> 03:49:58,234
[SPEAKER_37]: That's like roughly August.

2563
03:50:14,695 --> 03:50:15,937
[SPEAKER_37]: the sort of final proposal.

2564
03:50:16,538 --> 03:50:16,758
[SPEAKER_43]: Yeah.

2565
03:50:16,938 --> 03:50:21,645
[SPEAKER_37]: And then we vote late September or early October.

2566
03:50:22,206 --> 03:50:23,929
[SPEAKER_42]: Do you have specific dates in front of you?

2567
03:50:24,918 --> 03:50:30,040
[SPEAKER_37]: I mean, I can I can put them out there, but it involves us like reconsidering what we're doing next week.

2568
03:50:30,121 --> 03:50:30,381
[SPEAKER_37]: Right.

2569
03:50:30,421 --> 03:50:35,643
[SPEAKER_37]: So we have we do have the potential to repurpose next week.

2570
03:50:36,083 --> 03:50:36,484
[SPEAKER_37]: Maybe not.

2571
03:50:36,504 --> 03:50:40,606
[SPEAKER_42]: I don't think we can fully repurpose, but I think it could be like a that's fine.

2572
03:50:40,626 --> 03:50:42,206
[SPEAKER_37]: We could say we could say July 9th.

2573
03:50:42,727 --> 03:50:47,629
[SPEAKER_37]: We could say, you know, verbal verbal public dialogue, July 9th.

2574
03:50:48,276 --> 03:50:57,518
[SPEAKER_37]: Meaning we're going to continue to hear comment basically another version of what we did today Maybe a little more sort of pointed or or you know on specific topics.

2575
03:50:57,958 --> 03:51:15,443
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay We could do that again on July 23rd that could be the end of that We could accept written in parallel or we could just do just the ninth Um, just kind of throwing it out there Yeah, and I think um

2576
03:51:15,938 --> 03:51:18,239
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm going to pause on the dialogue at the end of July.

2577
03:51:18,259 --> 03:51:21,501
[SPEAKER_37]: Iterate in August.

2578
03:51:23,121 --> 03:51:28,044
[SPEAKER_37]: One more round of discussion and feedback with the public in early September.

2579
03:51:28,064 --> 03:51:32,406
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah, I think we can also ask members of the public if they have already spoken.

2580
03:51:34,362 --> 03:51:47,209
[SPEAKER_42]: and they do not have new comments to share, to maybe consider another method, maybe sending an email, because we do want to provide opportunity for all voices to be heard.

2581
03:51:47,229 --> 03:51:53,373
[SPEAKER_49]: I sort of lost track of when are we folding in these other

2582
03:51:55,022 --> 03:52:01,705
[SPEAKER_42]: to vote on, like, you know, the so if we so if we go with what board member La Valley is saying, then we have.

2583
03:52:02,605 --> 03:52:03,986
[SPEAKER_42]: Be like one or two more meetings.

2584
03:52:04,586 --> 03:52:09,808
[SPEAKER_42]: Let's say one meeting July 9th where we receive additional verbal comment.

2585
03:52:11,349 --> 03:52:12,829
[SPEAKER_42]: And if you've already shown up tonight.

2586
03:52:14,490 --> 03:52:15,650
[SPEAKER_42]: You didn't get heard.

2587
03:52:15,710 --> 03:52:16,691
[SPEAKER_42]: We have your name circled.

2588
03:52:16,771 --> 03:52:17,071
[SPEAKER_42]: You'll be a

2589
03:52:25,905 --> 03:52:29,646
[SPEAKER_42]: We'll have to figure that out at some point, but we'll do comments.

2590
03:52:29,666 --> 03:52:36,527
[SPEAKER_42]: The 9th, then what did we do?

2591
03:52:36,727 --> 03:52:39,027
[SPEAKER_42]: We close, or no, we.

2592
03:52:39,388 --> 03:52:41,328
[SPEAKER_37]: Except written until the 23rd.

2593
03:52:41,668 --> 03:52:43,008
[SPEAKER_42]: Except written until the 23rd.

2594
03:52:45,389 --> 03:52:45,669
[SPEAKER_37]: Then.

2595
03:52:46,209 --> 03:52:47,689
[SPEAKER_42]: Then we as a board need to deliberate.

2596
03:52:47,709 --> 03:52:48,489
[SPEAKER_37]: Deliberate in August.

2597
03:52:48,509 --> 03:52:51,490
[SPEAKER_42]: So that would be the 6th and prioritize.

2598
03:52:55,335 --> 03:53:02,417
[SPEAKER_42]: And then also, I think you've said this a couple of times, but make very concrete suggestions and recommendations.

2599
03:53:05,418 --> 03:53:05,718
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay.

2600
03:53:06,138 --> 03:53:11,560
[SPEAKER_42]: And then we would want to give Innocent Associates time to iterate.

2601
03:53:11,640 --> 03:53:13,700
[SPEAKER_37]: Give them the rest of August at least.

2602
03:53:13,800 --> 03:53:14,161
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah.

2603
03:53:14,401 --> 03:53:14,681
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah.

2604
03:53:14,721 --> 03:53:19,502
[SPEAKER_42]: So that brings us to, so 8-20 would be kind of a whatever meeting.

2605
03:53:20,262 --> 03:53:22,163
[SPEAKER_37]: And we evangelize the output of that.

2606
03:53:23,053 --> 03:53:24,073
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes.

2607
03:53:24,093 --> 03:53:29,795
[SPEAKER_37]: And potentially do one more round of dialogue with the public in early September.

2608
03:53:30,515 --> 03:53:37,937
[SPEAKER_42]: So 9-3 is our next meeting, and then 9-17.

2609
03:53:41,618 --> 03:53:44,978
[SPEAKER_42]: So maybe we present the first iteration on the 3rd.

2610
03:53:44,998 --> 03:53:49,259
[SPEAKER_37]: Deliberate on the 17th and vote on the 1st.

2611
03:53:55,973 --> 03:53:57,194
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm just throwing it out there.

2612
03:53:57,214 --> 03:54:01,457
[SPEAKER_37]: By all means, people can propose something different.

2613
03:54:01,878 --> 03:54:05,600
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah, and then this all falls under the caveat of man plans, God laughs.

2614
03:54:05,960 --> 03:54:06,581
[SPEAKER_42]: So yeah.

2615
03:54:10,163 --> 03:54:11,344
[SPEAKER_42]: Peter, Ari, Adam.

2616
03:54:14,066 --> 03:54:16,028
[SPEAKER_42]: John, how do you feel?

2617
03:54:16,608 --> 03:54:19,030
[SPEAKER_42]: Should I put this, should I type this up and like share it?

2618
03:54:19,050 --> 03:54:20,351
[SPEAKER_42]: Let me see.

2619
03:54:27,135 --> 03:54:27,395
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

2620
03:54:29,736 --> 03:54:30,056
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

2621
03:54:33,137 --> 03:54:33,357
Yes.

2622
03:54:37,579 --> 03:54:39,920
[SPEAKER_41]: And then I would add the first one there, 10-1.

2623
03:54:41,200 --> 03:54:41,480
[SPEAKER_41]: Yeah.

2624
03:54:44,562 --> 03:54:45,502
[SPEAKER_40]: That's like potential.

2625
03:54:46,022 --> 03:54:46,942
[SPEAKER_40]: Yeah, that would work.

2626
03:54:48,523 --> 03:54:51,704
[SPEAKER_41]: She might want to have public disciplines, I noticed.

2627
03:54:52,404 --> 03:54:53,805
[SPEAKER_41]: They would hear something on the phone.

2628
03:56:57,687 --> 03:57:00,249
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay, so to get us literally all on the same page.

2629
03:57:05,273 --> 03:57:08,056
[SPEAKER_42]: And let me make this bigger, as big as I can make it.

2630
03:57:08,076 --> 03:57:16,563
[SPEAKER_41]: I got it, yeah.

2631
03:57:17,484 --> 03:57:18,665
[SPEAKER_41]: So board members.

2632
03:57:28,497 --> 03:57:41,844
[SPEAKER_35]: I think this is a very sensible timeline and I think it might make sense for me to talk offline with Alicia about logistics of if you guys will be able to make forum without me for some of those, but I think it sounds very reasonable.

2633
03:57:43,085 --> 03:57:44,866
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, I like it.

2634
03:57:44,926 --> 03:57:50,669
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I think this makes the most sense given what we've discussed this evening.

2635
03:57:52,470 --> 03:57:55,792
[SPEAKER_42]: Might be the best decision that we can make given all the information we have today.

2636
03:57:56,888 --> 03:58:03,092
[SPEAKER_42]: Your screen has the dates off to the left.

2637
03:58:03,232 --> 03:58:05,494
[SPEAKER_41]: I don't see August 6th on your screen.

2638
03:58:08,816 --> 03:58:09,776
[SPEAKER_42]: Oh, yeah, okay.

2639
03:58:11,357 --> 03:58:11,778
[SPEAKER_42]: Sorry.

2640
03:58:12,018 --> 03:58:12,618
[SPEAKER_42]: No, you're good.

2641
03:58:12,638 --> 03:58:15,080
[SPEAKER_42]: The joys of formatting.

2642
03:58:16,541 --> 03:58:16,781
Right.

2643
03:58:21,164 --> 03:58:22,645
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay, so yeah, that includes...

2644
03:58:24,027 --> 03:58:24,627
[SPEAKER_42]: That's it, right?

2645
03:58:25,088 --> 03:58:26,888
[SPEAKER_41]: Yeah.

2646
03:58:26,928 --> 03:58:28,629
[SPEAKER_41]: How many bullets are there?

2647
03:58:28,729 --> 03:58:32,491
[SPEAKER_41]: June 25th, July 9th, July 23rd, closed written comment.

2648
03:58:32,832 --> 03:58:33,752
[SPEAKER_41]: Why don't I have that?

2649
03:58:38,154 --> 03:58:39,915
[SPEAKER_41]: Something happened with the format.

2650
03:58:39,935 --> 03:58:40,896
[SPEAKER_41]: Something funky.

2651
03:58:46,139 --> 03:58:50,460
[SPEAKER_41]: make your font go back to a regular size, and then just use your Zoom slider.

2652
03:58:52,000 --> 03:58:55,101
[SPEAKER_41]: Like, make the font small, and then use the Zoom slider.

2653
03:58:55,321 --> 03:58:56,621
[SPEAKER_41]: I think something happened there.

2654
03:58:56,661 --> 03:58:57,202
[SPEAKER_41]: That's weird.

2655
03:58:57,422 --> 03:59:00,562
[SPEAKER_41]: So it is 6 September 3, 2017.

2656
03:59:01,903 --> 03:59:02,803
[SPEAKER_41]: Yeah.

2657
03:59:02,983 --> 03:59:03,303
[SPEAKER_41]: OK.

2658
03:59:03,543 --> 03:59:09,724
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm not hearing any more feedback or objections from the board.

2659
03:59:09,744 --> 03:59:12,205
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm seeing some thumbs up.

2660
03:59:13,763 --> 03:59:21,385
[SPEAKER_42]: So what we'd be looking for at this point is, actually, I think, do we need to do the ADU separately to another different date certain?

2661
03:59:22,045 --> 03:59:24,525
[SPEAKER_41]: It could be the same date certain.

2662
03:59:24,846 --> 03:59:25,426
[SPEAKER_41]: Okay.

2663
03:59:25,866 --> 03:59:28,066
[SPEAKER_41]: I think you need to be clear that you're voting on both.

2664
03:59:28,506 --> 03:59:28,846
[SPEAKER_41]: Yeah.

2665
03:59:29,427 --> 03:59:30,827
[SPEAKER_41]: Or voting separately.

2666
03:59:31,527 --> 03:59:32,507
Okay.

2667
03:59:33,388 --> 03:59:34,488
[SPEAKER_41]: I need a new contract.

2668
03:59:34,608 --> 03:59:36,288
[SPEAKER_41]: Yeah, you do.

2669
03:59:36,748 --> 03:59:37,008
[SPEAKER_41]: Yeah.

2670
03:59:37,168 --> 03:59:37,649
[SPEAKER_41]: It's okay.

2671
03:59:44,158 --> 03:59:45,798
[SPEAKER_41]: Um.

2672
03:59:45,818 --> 03:59:46,439
[SPEAKER_41]: You so good.

2673
03:59:48,499 --> 03:59:48,659
[SPEAKER_41]: Um.

2674
03:59:50,380 --> 03:59:53,560
[SPEAKER_42]: So I'm going to propose that the way we talk about what's next.

2675
03:59:54,201 --> 03:59:56,281
[SPEAKER_42]: Um we're talking about accessory

2676
04:00:04,338 --> 04:00:05,419
[SPEAKER_42]: They're so intertwined.

2677
04:00:05,899 --> 04:00:11,682
[SPEAKER_42]: I don't see a world in which we can decide ADU without deciding neighborhood residential, urban residential.

2678
04:00:12,422 --> 04:00:20,747
[SPEAKER_42]: So the dates that we would consider, that we would continue to, would also be applicable for the ADU topic.

2679
04:00:23,542 --> 04:00:23,762
[SPEAKER_43]: Yeah.

2680
04:00:24,202 --> 04:00:24,382
Okay.

2681
04:00:25,463 --> 04:00:26,883
[SPEAKER_42]: Are there any, what'd you say?

2682
04:00:27,344 --> 04:00:27,824
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes, sir.

2683
04:00:28,424 --> 04:00:31,185
[SPEAKER_42]: Well, I'm sorry then.

2684
04:00:31,685 --> 04:00:32,446
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm so sorry.

2685
04:00:33,826 --> 04:00:34,126
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay.

2686
04:00:34,646 --> 04:00:47,171
[SPEAKER_42]: So what I'm looking for right now is a motion to continue to a date certain, and then which, God, what date would that be?

2687
04:00:47,191 --> 04:00:48,032
[SPEAKER_42]: Would that be the sixth?

2688
04:00:49,252 --> 04:00:50,033
[SPEAKER_42]: No, cause we're not,

2689
04:00:52,070 --> 04:00:53,071
[SPEAKER_42]: So, right.

2690
04:00:53,331 --> 04:00:55,253
[SPEAKER_22]: It would be the 9th.

2691
04:00:55,293 --> 04:00:56,014
[SPEAKER_32]: July 9th.

2692
04:00:56,434 --> 04:00:57,015
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay.

2693
04:00:57,115 --> 04:00:57,996
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes, yes, yes, yes.

2694
04:00:58,036 --> 04:01:04,662
[SPEAKER_32]: Publicize these dates and you should make clear that the September 3rd is verbal public comment.

2695
04:01:05,102 --> 04:01:05,302
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay.

2696
04:01:05,322 --> 04:01:07,444
[SPEAKER_32]: Because people are asking about that.

2697
04:01:07,464 --> 04:01:09,966
[SPEAKER_41]: Okay.

2698
04:01:12,289 --> 04:01:14,010
[SPEAKER_41]: Another line.

2699
04:01:14,951 --> 04:01:16,873
[SPEAKER_32]: So right now you would only

2700
04:01:17,743 --> 04:01:23,308
[SPEAKER_32]: actually continue to July 9th, but we could advertise this whole schedule to the public.

2701
04:01:23,868 --> 04:01:34,837
[SPEAKER_42]: So what we're looking for is a motion to continue to July 9th for both the accessory dwelling units as well as the neighborhood residential urban residential.

2702
04:01:37,579 --> 04:01:38,219
[SPEAKER_49]: So moved.

2703
04:01:38,880 --> 04:01:39,640
[SPEAKER_42]: Do I have a second?

2704
04:01:43,864 --> 04:01:44,244
[SPEAKER_49]: Second.

2705
04:01:44,925 --> 04:01:45,245
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

2706
04:01:46,962 --> 04:01:48,182
[SPEAKER_42]: So I'm going to do a roll call vote.

2707
04:01:48,202 --> 04:01:50,003
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm going to do them as I see them.

2708
04:01:52,943 --> 04:01:53,783
[SPEAKER_42]: John Anderson.

2709
04:01:54,544 --> 04:01:54,884
[SPEAKER_49]: Yes.

2710
04:01:55,664 --> 04:01:56,344
[SPEAKER_42]: Ben LaValle.

2711
04:01:56,984 --> 04:01:57,124

[SPEAKER_42]: Peter Kalbs.

2715
04:02:06,066 --> 04:02:06,186
[SPEAKER_42]: Aye.

2716
04:02:07,626 --> 04:02:08,286
[SPEAKER_42]: Adam Behrens.

2717
04:02:09,587 --> 04:02:09,707
[SPEAKER_36]: Aye.

2718
04:02:10,787 --> 04:02:12,967

[SPEAKER_42]: neighborhood residential urban residential as well as 80 you to July 9th.

2721
04:02:26,520 --> 04:02:29,142
[SPEAKER_42]: Is there anything else I need to say to seal that in?

2722
04:02:29,222 --> 04:02:33,924
[SPEAKER_32]: I mean, I think you should say that the staff are directed to advertise this schedule.

2723
04:02:34,165 --> 04:02:36,426
[SPEAKER_42]: So we will we will advertise this full schedule.

2724
04:02:36,446 --> 04:02:36,486
[SPEAKER_42]: Um,

2725
04:02:42,217 --> 04:02:45,958
[SPEAKER_42]: And then I just, I just appreciate so deeply everyone being here and providing comment.

2726
04:02:46,658 --> 04:02:52,019
[SPEAKER_42]: We will share this, but feel free to like take a picture or, you know, write it down.

2727
04:02:52,640 --> 04:02:57,361
[SPEAKER_42]: These dates won't change, you know, unless, unless they do, unless they do.

2728
04:02:57,381 --> 04:02:57,461
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah.

2729
04:03:01,582 --> 04:03:01,942
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay.

2730
04:03:02,182 --> 04:03:05,563
[SPEAKER_42]: So with that, we're going to move on to our next agenda item.

2731
04:03:08,922 --> 04:03:10,124
[SPEAKER_42]: Um, and then, um, zoning updates.

2732
04:03:10,945 --> 04:03:12,448
[SPEAKER_42]: What's going on zoning guys?

2733
04:03:14,070 --> 04:03:14,551
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm kidding.

2734
04:03:15,452 --> 04:03:19,238
[SPEAKER_42]: Um and then the next item we have is adjournment.

2735
04:03:19,258 --> 04:03:23,665
[SPEAKER_42]: But I did want to kind of make two little announcements about

2736
04:03:24,726 --> 04:03:30,370
[SPEAKER_42]: Um, one, a member of our board and then also somebody that helps us in the city that's been recognized for their work.

2737
04:03:30,970 --> 04:03:37,535
[SPEAKER_42]: Um, so Alicia has received the Mystic Leadership Award for her work on the Clippership Connector.

2738
04:03:37,555 --> 04:03:41,858
[SPEAKER_42]: Um, the Clippership Connector is a shared use path that's opening this July.

2739
04:03:41,878 --> 04:03:44,240
[SPEAKER_42]: This has been in the works for over 10 years.

2740
04:03:45,180 --> 04:03:47,942
[SPEAKER_42]: And we're so thankful to people like Alicia and her colleagues.

2741
04:03:48,643 --> 04:03:50,624
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm so happy that her work is being recognized.

2742
04:03:50,744 --> 04:03:53,206
[SPEAKER_42]: So I just wanted to kind of put that into our meeting.

2743
04:03:58,509 --> 04:04:03,292
[SPEAKER_42]: And then on the board, I saw this on LinkedIn, so sorry, Peter.

2744
04:04:04,072 --> 04:04:12,276
[SPEAKER_42]: Peter just obtained his professional engineer license in the state of Massachusetts, which as a daughter of an engineer is no small feat.

2745
04:04:12,437 --> 04:04:14,718
[SPEAKER_42]: So congratulations, Peter.

2746
04:04:19,285 --> 04:04:26,410
[SPEAKER_42]: And if any other members of the board have things they want called out that are not on LinkedIn, let me know and I'll do it.

2747
04:04:27,851 --> 04:04:30,733
[SPEAKER_42]: So the next item we have on our agenda is adjournment.

2748
04:04:33,174 --> 04:04:33,755
[SPEAKER_42]: Don't all jump.

2749
04:04:34,836 --> 04:04:37,077
[SPEAKER_49]: I move we adjourn.

2750
04:04:37,197 --> 04:04:37,818
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you, John.

2751
04:04:38,338 --> 04:04:39,058
[SPEAKER_42]: Can I have a second?

2752
04:04:39,159 --> 04:04:39,819
[SPEAKER_42]: Second.

2753
04:04:40,720 --> 04:04:41,180
