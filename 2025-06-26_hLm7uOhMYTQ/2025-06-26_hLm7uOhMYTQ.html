    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=262.573s">So</a>  before we begin, I just want to run down the agenda for tonight's meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=267.338s">We're</a>  going to be continuing our public hearing on neighborhood and urban residential zoning districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=272.944s">I</a>  know that's why a lot of you are here and have joined virtually, so thank you for that, as well as opening a new hearing on accessory dwelling units or ADUs. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=282.361s">We're</a>  going to open these public hearings together. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=284.081s">We're</a>  going to hear a presentation from Emily and Paula of Innocent Associates. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=288.543s">We're</a>  going to take board and public comments on both topics at once. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=294.664s">We</a>  do have sign up sheets in the back where you can indicate what topic, it could be both, you want to comment on. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=302.786s">And</a>  we're just going to do this to help manage public comment and make sure that we're providing enough space <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=310.328s">for</a>  all of us to provide comment this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=317.335s">As</a>  you can see, we anticipate a lot of public participation, which is good. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=321.5s">We</a>  want to emphasize this is good for Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=326.932s">I</a>  do plan to take a short recess around 8.15, 8.30, depending on how the evening goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=332.515s">That'll</a>  be about 10, 15 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=335.837s">If</a>  you need to leave for any point, we're all adults. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=339.099s">Please</a>  take care of yourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=341.7s">But</a>  then right around 10 o'clock, we're going to take a step back and reassess, do we have enough time and mental capacity as a group <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=350.905s">to</a>  continue to hear public comment or do we need to continue this to another date? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=356.586s">I</a>  know that's not ideal, but we have so much feedback to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=360.587s">We</a>  don't want anyone to be shortchanged or anybody to not have their voice heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=366.428s">So</a>  just giving everybody a heads up, around 10 o'clock, we're gonna take a beat and kind of reassess what our plan should be moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=375.73s">So</a>  the two options there could be to vote these topics out of the Community Development Board, <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=380.466s">or</a>  continue to a date certain. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=382.369s">So</a>  those are kind of the two options. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=385.493s">And</a>  again, we wanna make sure we're able to listen and digest and respect your feedback, everybody's feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=403.275s">So</a>  what I'm gonna do first is read the public notice for the ADU agenda item into the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=410.419s">Let's</a>  see. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=417.538s">This</a>  is the part that you guys probably usually take a water bathroom break during, but thank you for being here in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=424.823s">So</a>  the next item we're gonna hear first is a combination of the accessory dwelling units presentation, as well as a continuation of public hearing for neighborhood residential, urban residential zoning amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=441.435s">The</a>  ADU is a new public hearing, so I'm gonna read the public hearing notice into the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=446.472s">The</a>  Medford Community Development Board shall conduct a public hearing on June 18th, 2025, after 6.30 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=452.417s">in</a>  the Medford City Council Chambers on the second floor of Medford City Hall, 85 George P. Hassett Drive, Medford Mass, and via Zoom remote video conferencing relative to the following proposed amendments to the City of Medford Zoning Ordinance and Zoning Map. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=468.349s">Amend</a>  section 94-8.2, Accessory Dwelling Units, to comply with MGL <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=476.351s">to</a>  amend and add various definitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=478.032s">The</a>  link to the zoom community <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=506.192s">A</a>  subsequent public hearing on the same matter will be opened and held pending receipt of the Community Development Board recommendation by the Medford City Council on June 24th, 2025 at 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=517.023s">in</a>  the Medford City Council Chamber on the second floor of Medford City Hall, 85 George P. Hazlett Drive, Medford Mass, and via Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=525.251s">A</a>  link to the public hearing will be posted no later than Friday, June 20th, 2025. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=534.832s">So</a>  I would like to ask staff if they have any introductory comments before I hand it off to Innocent Associates. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=540.558s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=540.958s">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=542.7s">Emily</a>  and Paola, would you be able to do the presentation on accessory dwelling units? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=548.025s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=551.239s">So</a>  with your permission, Madam Chair, we would like to have the accessory dwelling units first, and then take you through the rest of the information. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=559.446s">While</a>  palace sharing her screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=562.149s">For</a>  the record, my name is Emily Ennis of Innes Associates and I'm here with my colleague Palo Ramos Martinez, who is our chief resilience officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=570.056s">You</a>  want to go to the next slide please. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=574.319s">It</a>  takes a second or two to for the for the internet elves to run up and back. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=578.922s">So</a>  we're going to go very quickly through the first part the process timelines public comments I think everybody's seen that before. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=585.007s">I</a>  will then turn it over to Paula for the accessory dwelling units and the residential districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=591.671s">The</a>  timeline since March we've been working on this for a little bit over a year now for all of the city zoning updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=599.637s">The</a>  timeline since March has been as you see here, the blue are the meetings with the planning and permitting committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=606.423s">The</a>  black are the Community Development Board meetings and the green meetings are those special meetings that we've had as public listening sessions on the different topics. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=617.533s">While</a>  we will have many more meetings, I am sure over the next few months, the current one that is scheduled is with yourselves next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=626.347s">The</a>  current anticipated topic is the squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=631.141s">All</a>  of this comes out of two main documents, the Medford Massachusetts Comprehensive Plan, which was approved in January 2023, and the Climate Action and Adaptation Plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=642.806s">Both</a>  of those had recommendations for zoning changes in them. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=647.228s">The</a>  city has actually been working on the zoning ordinance since the recodification process began back in to 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=657.112s">And</a>  you can recording in progress map some of the things that we have discussed in the past, this idea of these quarters, squares, neighborhoods, as we're talking about today, and other areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=671.415s">I</a>  do want to point people to an interactive map that we have created online. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=677.017s">All</a>  of the maps that you see today can be created by going online. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=682.078s">There</a>  is at the site that was mentioned earlier the city's own zoning site. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=686.54s">There</a>  is a tutorial that has been shown on there, and you can go to the interactive map by clicking either on this link, and this will also be up on the website, probably on Friday or by clicking or by taking a picture of the QR code. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=704.227s">Before</a>  we get started, I just want to say, or before I turn it over to Paula, I just want to say that actually a lot of the information in this presentation has been presented to the board before. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=714.494s">We</a>  will go fairly quickly over that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=717.496s">We</a>  have a lot of slides. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=718.636s">We</a>  have a lot of people, and congratulations to the city for having so many people come to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=724.821s">We</a>  are thrilled to see this many people both in person and online. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=728.783s">So</a>  we'll go quickly through the pieces that you've seen before. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=731.866s">We</a>  would, of course, at the board's direction or the chair's direction, be happy to return to any of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=737.591s">We</a>  will slow down a little bit on those things that you have not seen before. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=741.835s">And</a>  again, this will be available for people to see at a later date, but much of this is already online. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=746.86s">With</a>  that, I'm going to turn it over to Bella.</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=754.127s">Hello,</a>  everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=755.428s">I</a>  hope you hear me well. <a

href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=765.236s">So</a>  what we're going to show first, and just let me say first that I'm also very glad that we have so many people joining. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=773.764s">This</a>  is really what we wanted from the very beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=777.047s">So</a>  if it's the first time, welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=781.25s">enjoy.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=781.711s">Um,</a>  and so what we're going to start presenting is those maps that we have seen. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=788.721s">First</a>  we want to look into. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=791.585s">We're</a>  going to see two maps. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=792.767s">The</a>  first one is the map that has been recommended <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=797.013s">the</a>  city council to the city board. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=800.356s">Is</a>  the one you see here, and we have five different residential districts that we propose in the in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=812.608s">We</a>  have neighborhood residential one neighborhood residential to neighborhood residential three urban residential one and urban residential to <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=821.476s">Um,</a>  so we will talk about what does that mean in the later, um, slides. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=828.238s">But</a>  just so we know this is the first map. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=831.159s">This</a>  is the map that was referred from the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=834.58s">And</a>  after I think this is the fifth time we're looking into this topic at the city community develop at the community development board. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=844.402s">we</a>  have been working in a different map with the Community Development Board input, sorry, and also the public and public feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=859.024s">Um</a>  so the first topic that we're going to talk is the accessory dwelling units. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=863.127s">This</a>  is a topic that we've already as Emily mentioned, we've already, um, shown, um, to the community <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=876.817s">mentioned</a>  that there is an accessory dwelling unit guidebook that is done by the city of Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=882.658s">It</a>  is very complete and has many different examples. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=886.199s">It</a>  has the definition, what it has to accomplish, what typologies there could be for small lots, medium lots, and bigger lots. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=900.782s">And</a>  so if anyone is interested in this topic, they have many, many examples. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=907.424s">Um</a>  so we are talking about accessory dwelling unit because on February, the state passed a law about a protected use accessory dwelling unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=921.124s">So,</a>  um. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=923.547s">METFOR</a>  already had an ordinance about ADUs, but now it needs to be aligned with that new regulation that the state has published. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=936.256s">And</a>  so there are some prohibited regulations that the municipality cannot really regulate, that comes from the state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=945.143s">And</a>  those are owner occupancy requirement, <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=948.325s">and</a>  occupancy restriction, minimum parking requirement, minimum parking requirement, use and occupancy restriction, unique caps and density and then the relationship to principal dwelling. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=957.171s">Um</a>  so all these regulations that you had some in your current regulation needs to, um, not be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=964.616s">So</a>  what we're doing is looking into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=966.898s">Um</a>  and proposing a new <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=974.403s">Um,</a>  what are the municipality decisions that are there is allowing accessory dwelling units in any residential districts right now is for single residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=984.734s">Um,</a>  what they call single residential districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=988.117s">But</a>  we're also could be allowed that local 80 you not the protected use. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=993.863s">allow</a>  bigger ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=995.324s">I'm</a>  sorry, allow additional ideas more than one by a special permit and also restrictions or prohibitions on short term rental. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1004.146s">So</a>  those are mainly the things that local municipality can decide. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1011.527s">So</a>  for the protected ADUs, we have dimensional standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1017.273s">Those</a>  are not to be larger than 900 square foot or half of the gross floor area of the principal dwelling, whichever is smaller. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1028.586s">Um,</a>  the dimensionally standards, um, cannot be more restrictive than those that are required for principal dwelling, single family residential or accessory structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1041.875s">And</a>  that is the section where you have all those mentioned requirements for accessory structures in your current zoning section 94 dash 4.3. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1051.362s">and</a>  then for off street parking, there shall be one additional for ADUs located outside half mile radius of any transit station, and no additional parking for ADUs located within half a mile radius of any transit station. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1069.213s">These</a>  two can be more permissive, but we cannot require more than what they are having here. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1078.398s">Um,</a>  so these are the, um, the requirements for protected uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1085.783s">Um,</a>  locally to use. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1087.464s">We</a>  have the same requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1089.585s">The</a>  local ladies, um, as we have discussed before, are those 80 years that can be allowed in presidential districts that do not have <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1100.872s">that</a>  we are talking about is a single family, um, unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1105.873s">So,</a>  for example, in the districts that we are talking and we will talk about would be, um you are one and you are two. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1113.715s">And</a>  so for those any single <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1125.219s">So</a>  the requirements are the same as the protected use. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1128.68s">And</a>  then there is also a special permit, local ADU. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1133.822s">So</a>  if anyone wants to add a second ADU, that has to be a special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1140.665s">So</a>  it has to go through the city board and the requirements are the same as the protected ADU and the local by right ADU. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1150.665s">So</a>  what does it mean for all of the, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1154.908s">All</a>  of the desk districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1156.33s">We</a>  have enter one. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1158.131s">The</a>  permitted building types in enter one is single unit dwelling and then the historic conversion. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1164.116s">We</a>  can. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1164.616s">We</a>  will also talk about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1166.138s">What</a>  that is later, but mainly is those big historic houses that can be converted into multi unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1175.685s">or</a>  more than at least one. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1179.786s">We</a>  will see more of these specifics later on. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1182.766s">So</a>  in the NR1, we have single unit dwelling, historic conversion. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1188.067s">Because</a>  we have a single unit dwelling, then we do have a protected use ADU. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1193.409s">So</a>  we have that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1194.609s">That</a>  is allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1196.849s">And</a>  then we could have another one by special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1201.311s">In</a>  NR2, we have single unit, two unit, and then historic conversion. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1207.119s">Here</a>  as well, because we do have the single unit, we can allow a protected ADU, and then a second by a special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1216.894s">and</a>  our three we have single two unit three unit and historic conversion again because we have that single unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1224.519s">We</a>  have protected 80 you and then another one only by a special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1230.462s">And</a>  then you are one. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1231.663s">We</a>  have two unit three unit multiplex. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1235.285s">This</a>  is from 4 to 6 units, townhouse and historic conversion, and we would allow local 80 you <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1243.551s">only</a>  for one, two, and three units. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1247.435s">So</a>  in this district, if there is any single existing, if there is any two or three units, then you could have another unit as ADU, and that is your local ADU, and a second by special permit only. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1264.229s">And</a>  in UR1, <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1266.586s">the</a>  the principal buildings that are allowed is three unit multiplex townhouse and historic conversion. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1274.99s">And</a>  then so any one, two and three, so one that is already existing, two unit that is already existing, and then any existing or new three unit will be allowed a local ADU and the other will be by special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1291.858s">I</a>  know it's a little bit confusing, but we have the table so you can look at it with a little bit more attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1300.806s">So</a>  this is for the ADUs. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1303.568s">I</a>  know that if it's the first time that you're hearing about this, you might have many questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1309.433s">So</a>  you can always ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1312.891s">whatever</a>  you need to know, we are here to answer that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1317.732s">So</a>  lot requirements, this is a new information. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1320.093s">We</a>  haven't shown this information before. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1324.594s">We</a>  have talked about the content, but because we've seen that it's a little bit difficult to understand in a more text way, we have created a lot of visuals. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1336.797s">So</a>  to see if it's, <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1339.118s">a</a>  little bit easier to understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1340.698s">Um,</a>  so what we want to, um, to show is what requirements are there that we need to apply to every lot, and it help us shape, um, the end result. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1357.183s">And</a>  so <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1359.003s">First</a>  of all, we have your normal lot facing the main street. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1365.765s">And</a>  so the first thing that we will look into it is what are the conditions of that lot? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1371.866s">So</a>  what is the minute the lot area? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1374.227s">So,</a>  for example, this lot area is 4000 square foot. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1380.308s">our</a>  requirement for many of this residential district is a minimum lot area of 4,000 square foot. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1387.671s">So</a>  that requirement we can take because it's 4,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1391.892s">The</a>  next one will be the frontage that is the line between our front, the front of our lot and the street, the main street. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1400.716s">So</a>  that line is called the frontage and the requirement is that it needs to be bigger than 35. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1407.918s">This</a>  lot is 40, so then we can take that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1411.42s">Yes,</a>  check. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1412.34s">We</a>  do have this requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1415.062s">The</a>  next one will be the setbacks. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1416.762s">So</a>  this is not really what is there, something that you cannot change as your lot, but something that you can introduce unless it's existing. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1427.347s">But</a>  if it's a new building, then you would have to follow the setback requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1432.99s">You</a>  have a front yard of 10 side yards of five and rear yard of 10, for example. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1439.817s">If</a>  you have that, then we can check as well that requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1443.6s">And</a>  that means that within that area is where you can place your principal building. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1450.962s">Then</a>  we also have a building coverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1453.165s">The</a>  requirement will be 40%, so we cannot go over that requirement of that 40%. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1461.372s">And</a>  then we also have, we introduced the permeable surface. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1465.697s">We</a>  have a minimum permeable surface of 30%. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1470.977s">And</a>  then we have the requirement of open landscape. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1474.019s">And</a>  so the 20% of the land has to be green, has to be vegetation only. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1480.443s">And</a>  finally, the last requirement would be the off-street parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1485.686s">So</a>  there are minimum off-street parking requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1488.608s">We</a>  would need to adhere to those. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1492.15s">There</a>  are many different requirements, but let's say single families, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1497.753s">it's</a>  allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1498.613s">The</a>  residential typologies are 1.5. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1501.114s">Let's</a>  stay with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1502.155s">This</a>  has to so it checks as well this requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1507.056s">So</a>  when we look into number of units and the lot size, and this is usually the question that we get is in a 4000. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1516.039s">It's</a>  allowed six units. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1517.74s">How</a>  that can be possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1524.822s">requirements.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1525.082s">And</a>  then when you follow all the requirements you can have just as a certain number of units. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1531.665s">So</a>  that's something that we wanted to show. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1535.547s">We</a>  also want to show the current zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1537.728s">Um</a>  and what are the lot requirements in your current zoning? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1541.27s">You</a>  do have these three single family duplex and the next one is multi family and <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1554.256s">Um,</a>  so for single family, you have 7,005,000 duplex. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1558.545s">We</a>  have minimum of 6,000 square foot large and multifamily. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1562.193s">Your</a>  minimum is 10,000 square foot. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1566.436s">So</a>  if we go to one unit dwelling, this is how it would look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1570.379s">Your</a>  lot area is 5,000, frontage 35. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1573.822s">You</a>  have a lot width. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1575.703s">That's</a>  something that in the new requirements that is taken out. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1578.906s">Your</a>  lot width is 50. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1580.567s">Setbacks</a>  are 15, side 7 1⁄2, rear 15. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1585.871s">Building</a>  coverage is the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1587.052s">We</a>  are not changing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1588.093s">It's</a>  40. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1589.053s">You</a>  do not have permeable surface, and you do not have an open landscape. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1593.957s">It's</a>  not applicable. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1595.498s">for</a>  the one unit dwelling. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1597.9s">Now</a>  also, the definition in your open landscape accepts all the things that it's not vegetation, it accepts sidewalks or terraces. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1609.006s">So</a>  you do not have any impervious surface limit or pervious surface requirement, and you do not have also green requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1621.26s">for</a>  the duplex is very similar to the other one. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1623.881s">It's</a>  just the lot areas are a little bit bigger. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1626.362s">6,000</a>  frontage, 35 lot with 60. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1630.624s">The</a>  setbacks are the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1631.764s">Building</a>  coverage is a little bit less, 35. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1634.485s">Open</a>  landscape, again, does not apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1636.826s">You</a>  can have all this as impervious surface. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1639.227s">That</a>  is okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1640.868s">Office</a>  street parking is 1.5. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1644.249s">Um</a>  and then for the multifamily lot area is passed from 6,000 to 10,000 frontage 50 lot with 100 and setbacks are 15. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1657.399s">All</a>  of them building coverage 35 and the open landscape requirement again doesn't <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1669.007s">So</a>  this is your existing requirements in your current zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1677.314s">So</a>  just putting one next to the other, on the left you see the current ones, and on the right the new requirements for each of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1688.903s">So</a>  the requirements for lot area for NR1, 2, 3, and 4 <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1694.808s">and</a>  you are to are all 4,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1698.429s">Again,</a>  this is for making sure that we add flexibility, making sure that all your non-conforming enter in this are now conforming, and that we have so many other requirements that will tell us how many units can be in 4,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1717.834s">frontage,</a>  35 and 35 for NR1 and 2. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1721.716s">And</a>  for NR3, UR1 and UR2 is 40. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1727.1s">We</a>  do not have the lot width. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1729.162s">We</a>  have facade build out only for NR3, UR1 and UR2. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1734.666s">And</a>  this is to make sure that the facade, there is some width. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1740.13s">Um.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1741.791s">So</a>  the front the main facade that is, uh, abutting the front street, um, that has a minimum of. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1757.543s">The</a>  heights are similar to what it was before, 2.5 for NR1 and 2. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1761.365s">And</a>  for NR3, your 1 and your 2 is 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1762.946s">We</a>  will have some suggestions and recommendations for your 2. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1772.513s">setbacks,</a>  and our 1, 2, and 3, and your 1 are front setback 10, side setback 5, rear setback 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1781.36s">And</a>  then for your 2, the front setback is 5, side 5, and rear 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1788.405s">Building</a>  coverage is all of them, except for your 2, all of them are 40. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1793.929s">Your</a>  2 is 50%. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1797.291s">Purview</a>  surface, so this is something we add. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1800.473s">Um</a>  all of them are 30% except for your two is 25 landscape. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1806.757s">Um</a>  so only and we, um, adapt new definition so that open scape landscape is only vegetation. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1816.583s">And</a>  so it's. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1819.224s">20%</a>  for all of them, except for your one that is</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1828.983s">I</a>  just like to add very quickly because I think we get a lot of questions as to where the numbers came from so last year about this time we had a meeting with the planning and permitting committee, obviously open as all of those were to the public, and we showed breakdowns of non conforming parcels throughout the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1846.572s">And</a>  so a lot of the recommendations come from those studies of non conformities. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1851.774s">All</a>  of those maps are static maps and they are on the town zoning website could have probably buried back in the history but they are all available for people to review and that analysis is what led to those recommendations.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1865.909s">And</a>  just to confirm, when you did that analysis, it was to align or to remove the nonconformities. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1872.132s">So</a>  to align what we're proposing and zoning with our current conditions?</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1877.414s">As</a>  much as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1878.635s">So</a>  the actual 4,000 square foot lot size, you actually have quite a few lots that are still in the 3,500 up range. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1888.98s">So</a>  we couldn't address all of the nonconformities, but we did try to reduce as many as possible.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1896.224s">you.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1896.324s">Great</a>  Thank you for that.</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1898.826s">Um</a>  so in this map, what we wanted to show and we are going to show this in the in in in other in the following slides as well with different lot areas, and I'm sorry that in the table because of the subtitles, it's covering half of the map. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1916.482s">So</a>  I'm sorry, but you will have <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1923.048s">Um</a>  so we wanted to, uh, address what are the sizes the real sizes of your lots in Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1930.331s">And</a>  so we start with this size between Lot area size between 3500 and 5000. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1936.454s">And</a>  so what do you get? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1938.854s">What</a>  we can see is that a lot of the Medford met for South Medford area. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1945.417s">Um,</a>  I would say 80% 70% of the <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1952.88s">When</a>  we go to the Lawrence State, for example, the big majority are bigger than this 5,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1960.868s">Usually</a>  it's because of the time, what is more historic, what has been densified during the historic times, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1971.898s">So</a>  usually newer neighborhoods have bigger lot sizes. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1979.243s">Um</a>  so in the proposed zoning because we heard a lot of what can you fit in the 4000 square foot lots? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1987.292s">We</a>  wanted to make some tests and try with that 40 by 100. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=1993.458s">Um</a>  what can actually fit in there, taking into account all the record all the requirements that we just mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2002.427s">And</a>  so what we have done here is mentioning the requirements that are there. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2009.428s">And</a>  then what building types can be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2014.029s">So</a>  here, for example, we have the first is a single family, a single family in a 4,000 lot with two parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2022.231s">And</a>  we go to the surface. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2024.051s">We</a>  see that in the round, in the circle that is in the corner, we have <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2033.014s">the</a>  pie chart. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2035.356s">21%</a>  of building covered, so we are way below that 40% requirement, so we are good. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2041.021s">Permable</a>  is 44%, so it's below more than that 30% minimum requirement, so we are good. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2050.489s">And</a>  then the rest is driveway and parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2053.772s">What</a>  districts allow this typology is NR1, NR2, and NR3? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2059.296s">And</a>  then we also have the square footage per unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2063.838s">In</a>  this case, the house, the single family house would be 2,550 square foot. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2073.682s">So</a>  if we continue, what happened? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2075.863s">We</a>  have a two unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2077.583s">Does</a>  it fit? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2078.924s">And</a>  so what are the requirements? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2080.484s">Again,</a>  we have that pie chart again. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2083.486s">So</a>  we have building coverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2084.646s">21</a>  is the same as the other one. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2087.768s">we're</a>  still good with the permability requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2093.213s">Um</a>  and then the units we would have won the ground floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2097.356s">That</a>  is 85 850 and then the upper two floors or that one and a half would be 1700. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2102.06s">What</a>  districts would allow this <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2115.717s">What</a>  happened if we add another unit? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2117.318s">So</a>  now we have a three units and every of this units is 80 150 square foot. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2124.162s">Well,</a>  when we add all the parking requirement that we have, and this is the 1.5 off street parking, then we see that the permeable is 29%. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2132.786s">So</a>  we are below that requirement of 30%. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2140.03s">and</a>  so in that case, this wouldn't be possible unless we do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2145.394s">And</a>  so if we change that parking using permeable paving, then we would be in 49% of permeable and open landscape 29. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2157.842s">So</a>  we are also above that requirement of green being 20%. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2163.186s">And</a>  so in that case, we could have a three unit in a 4,000 square foot lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2168.489s">that</a>  we are within that half a mile of a transit high frequency transit, and so that we only need 0.8 off street <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2199.01s">different</a>  ways that this would work. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2202.011s">Four</a>  units, it's not possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2205.172s">So</a>  this would be that maximum, unless there are other things, unless, again, the requirements of parking is because of high transit or the units are smaller. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2219.936s">Otherwise,</a>  it is to start to get very difficult to fit more than three units. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2226.078s">examples</a>  that you have in Medford of single family buildings in lots that are 4000 square foot or less. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2232.743s">These</a>  are three of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2233.683s">You</a>  have quite a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2235.405s">Medford</a>  has the lots in Medford, as we as we saw before, are quite small. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2241.289s">So</a>  within that 4000 5000, we have quite a lot duplex lots that are in 4000 or less, and then three units that are in 4000 square foot or less. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2255.038s">These</a>  are Medford areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2258.779s">So</a>  we wanted to show, and this map has been using the filter function that we have on the interactive map, where you can also set the range for the lot sizes of the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2273.304s">So</a>  you can also filter and see it by yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2277.586s">If</a>  anyone wants to know how we do that, we are here. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2281.347s">We</a>  can show it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2283.948s">the</a>  meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2285.07s">Um</a>  so this will be 5,006,007,006,007,007,008,000 <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2299.344s">Um.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2300.724s">We</a>  also got the question about what happened with the division when we get into 8000. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2305.385s">That</a>  means two times 4000 so you could subdivide a lot of these lots for 8000 are very difficult shapes or very, very narrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2317.528s">And</a>  so when we also we have another requirement, the frontage <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2331.137s">And</a>  also I want to point that these subdivisions are mainly possible in certain areas, like you can see South Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2340.743s">These</a>  are very, very few lots that you could do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2346.862s">building</a>  type. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2347.583s">So</a>  first we saw what do we what can we fit in a 4000? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2352.267s">Now</a>  we say what type of lot sizes we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2357.031s">What</a>  lot sizes we need to fit other typologies. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2360.874s">And</a>  so what do we need for two dwelling? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2363.316s">But</a>  that is side by side for three townhouse, for example, and for a multiplex of four units. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2369.521s">What</a>  are the sizes that we need with the requirements that we have? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2374.326s">And</a>  so you're going to see them in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2377.449s">The</a>  lot size that we have for this example would be 4,800. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2381.313s">And</a>  the two units, each of these units are at 1,200 square foot. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2392.084s">The</a>  next one for the townhouse would be for three townhouses is 8800. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2398.211s">Each</a>  of this building, each of these units are 1600 square foot. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2407.121s">and</a>  then if we go to a four unit, we would have 6600 square foot lots, and these are 920 square foot per unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2419.448s">Just</a>  this can change depending on the parking requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2425.451s">Again,</a>  if you're in a high transit, that will reduce, and so you could have it less. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2431.655s">The</a>  building type, so if it's a smaller unit, <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2436.397s">that</a>  would also decrease the square footage. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2438.958s">So</a>  there are things to still keep in mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2442.659s">But</a>  it was just to have a better idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2445.28s">These</a>  are duplex, for example, in 5,000 square foot in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2451.002s">Some</a>  townhouses, you do not have a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2454.143s">So</a>  there are just a few examples. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2458.584s">And</a>  they're multiplex. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2461.565s">You</a>  have a four, these are two four units. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2464.927s">The</a>  one on the left were somewhere around 7,000, I think, not even. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2471.873s">Very</a>  good example, by the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2473.814s">And</a>  then this is a six unit multiplex. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2476.757s">And</a>  this was also around 7,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2481.401s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2483.502s">And</a>  I do just want to reiterate for the board that these aren't saying that these houses would absolutely happen this way, but the idea what we heard where people were wanting to understand kind of what was the maximum build on the minimum lot size. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2496.831s">So</a>  these are just examples of where the dimensional restrictions start to restrict what you can actually put on the lot so that you can only get up to three units on a 4,000 square foot lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2510.32s">If</a>  you actually do the permeable surfaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2512.724s">If</a>  you want to do some of those other building types the side by side rather than the stacked, you actually need larger lots just to be able to do those so that was the information we wanted to make sure that we conveyed.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2526.93s">Yeah,</a>  thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2527.751s">And</a>  I do recall the request to have pictures of actual properties in Medford that fit some of these descriptions. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2534.78s">I</a>  think this is very helpful for me and hopefully for everybody else to contextualize some of the information that you're sharing. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2542.49s">So</a>  thank you for that.</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2545.579s">And</a>  then we have the part of private ways that we wanted to explain sometimes with the visuals. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2553.024s">It's</a>  easier to understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2555.066s">So</a>  we have said that for the distribution of the new boundaries for the districts, we wanted to have in mind several criteria, one of them being, for example, near high transit, near service, <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2572.097s">Um,</a>  jobs, uh, production, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2577.999s">Lot</a>  sizes, topography. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2579.979s">One</a>  of them was private ways versus public ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2584.28s">So</a>  this information we already, um, we didn't presented it, but we delivered this. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2590.481s">So</a>  I'm going to go also a little bit fast because we want to hear from all of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2595.523s">Um.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2596.903s">So</a>  there are certain requirements for streets in order to be, in these cases, in your rules and regulations of the Medford Planning Board governing the subdivision of land. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2610.291s">And</a>  so you have these two types of class A and class B. Mainly what I want to say here is that at least you need for class A, it has to be a 60-foot right of way, and a class B is 50 right of way. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2625.54s">If</a>  we look at Medford, you almost don't have any of those roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2630.062s">And</a>  these are the ones that you see in this map are main roads, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2635.164s">Like</a>  you have Mystic, Main. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2638.406s">So</a>  you have a lot of the corridors and so the connectors, right, from place A to B. These are usually those wider than 15. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2654.599s">And</a>  so some of that, sorry, I'm going to go back. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2658.722s">Some</a>  of this we have, the public roads are in blue in this map, and then the orange roads are the private ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2668.089s">And</a>  so you do have some of the private ways.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2670.971s">So</a>  real quick, just to clarify, the legend on this is incorrect?</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2674.514s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2674.834s">Okay,</a>  what does the gray mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2676.335s">Like</a>  state roads?</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2678.216s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2678.457s">Okay,</a>  great.</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2679.277s">That</a>  is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2681.339s">I</a>  just saw that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2682.619s">So</a>  thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2685.061s">So</a>  the public roads are the blue ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2687.442s">The</a>  private roads are the orange. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2689.503s">This</a>  is wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2690.464s">And</a>  then we have these estate mass DOT ownership roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2698.175s">that</a>  are the gray ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2699.776s">So</a>  these are the ones that are in that wider than 50. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2704.938s">And</a>  so we do have some private roads in here, as you can see. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2710.9s">And</a>  then we have those examples with some pictures. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2714.241s">For</a>  example, this is Essex Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2720.103s">We</a>  have a lot of information, but I'm just going to go to the images so that we see what are the conditions of these streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2726.465s">There's</a>  another private road, Whitney, with those 50. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2730.906s">And</a>  then we go into the big majority of the Medford roads, public and private, that are between that 40 and 50, equal 40 and less than 40. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2744.29s">And</a>  so within the National Association of City Transportation Officials, this is the NACTO, they have certain recommendations, and we have used those to also bring into what should have a public road. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2763.841s">What</a>  are those neighborhood streets? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2766.162s">Um,</a>  obviously a lot of this is outside of zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2769.506s">We</a>  only attend, um, the private property. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2773.07s">So</a>  this is a lot of this is public, so we don't want to go there a lot, but just want to show, um, what are the conditions of certain of this private roads? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2783.703s">So</a>  then when we go to the 40 more than 40 less than 50 with that we have an example of what it should be like or what it should look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2795.393s">What</a>  should be the sizes. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2798.175s">And</a>  then we have the map showing what are those streets that are within <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2804.32s">40</a>  and 50. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2805.321s">And</a>  as we can see here, a lot of the public roads are also 40 and 50, are not in those standards or 50 and 60 are actually here. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2815.426s">Again,</a>  public roads, sorry, the orange. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2819.408s">And</a>  so what are those examples between a 40 and a 50? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2822.79s">We</a>  will see here in Blakely Road, Exeter Street, <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2827.892s">And</a>  then for equal to 40, again, we see a little bit that smaller scale. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2836.415s">And</a>  we go to Badger Road, Wheeler Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2840.837s">These</a>  are all private. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2841.757s">The</a>  ones that we show on images are all private roads, private ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2846.563s">Hickory</a>  Avenue, and then one is less than 40. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2852.465s">We</a>  see already now that a lot of those are private and a lot less are public. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2859.268s">And</a>  so we have Whitman Road, Dover Street, Chandler Road, Rural Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2866.291s">The</a>  bigger majority are in this one. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2869.032s">Winthrop,</a>  sorry, Winthrop Place, Winthrop, <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2875.194s">Sorry,</a>  court court. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2878.178s">Then</a>  we have another like usually North Medford because of topography has really. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2889.735s">The</a>  situation is not the best, let's say, like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2893.578s">So</a>  Landry Road, Bailey Street, Taft Street, the topography is also very amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2901.906s">Raymond</a>  Street, Granite Road, Hillsborough Road, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2910.536s">And</a>  I'll just jump in to say that the reason for showing this, Paula spoke to it earlier, but just to confirm, we heard a lot of questions about why we were recommending certain districts for some areas and not for others, question from people of why there was density higher in one place and not others. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2927.902s">This</a>  idea of topography and public versus private was something that we'd talked about in the past, but hadn't shown people. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2934.484s">So</a>  with that, I think we're onto our last section.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2940.017s">Can</a>  I interrupt for one thing? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2941.758s">Could</a>  you send me the slides so I can share them through the Google Drive for people on their own computers to see a little more easily? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2949.181s">And</a>  I just want to share that member Adam Behrens has joined. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2953.463s">He</a>  apologizes for being late, but he's now on Zoom for the record.</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2957.269s">And</a>  thank you, Director Hunt. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2959.03s">Actually,</a>  this is one of the largest slide decks we've ever done. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2962.753s">So</a>  we need to split it into three sets so that people will be able to download it on slower internet speeds. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2970.94s">We</a>  will do that, and we will get it to you as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2975.964s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Orlando]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2976.404s">A</a>  lot of what you're talking about <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2984.347s">These</a>  people have heard about a lot of could you could you could you switch it on? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=2996.712s">I</a>  would like to make a point that we. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3000.075s">I</a>  would like to make a point.</p>

    <p>[Paul Morgan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3001.517s">We've</a>  got 60 or 70 people here and 250 people online. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3005.341s">And</a>  I don't think we want to go through the thousand combinations on the zoning code that we already read and get some people up here to speak.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3012.79s">I</a>  appreciate that feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3016.054s">And</a>  it sounds like you're not alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3020.118s">But</a>  just to clarify, we're not planning to go any further into the zoning than what we've done now. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3026.361s">So</a>  if you could just please take your seat, we're going to be moving into board discussion, which may be brief, and then we're going to move into public comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3033.585s">Thank</a>  you, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3034.325s">Please</a>  take your seat. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3036.066s">Please</a>  take your seat. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3037.046s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3039.579s">Madam</a>  Chair, to that point, these recommendations are ones that you've seen before so we can end our presentation now. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3046.761s">And</a>  when the board is ready to come back to, to this point then we can bring them up again but that's the end of the information that has not been either haven't been presented, or had not been presented had not been presented but had been given to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3062.005s">So,</a>  you've seen this one before.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3072.162s">How</a>  long do you think this will take?</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3074.743s">Another</a>  10 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3076.804s">We</a>  are also eager to hear what people have to say.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3079.265s">All</a>  right, we're gonna keep going with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3082.166s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3087.992s">Okay,</a>  yeah, we're going to keep going with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3089.534s">I</a>  think this will help offer some clarity to the board as well as the public in terms of changes that we're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3097.545s">If</a>  your comments want to address specific changes, this is a really good time to listen or read what's on screen.</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3109.549s">So</a>  the proposed changes from what was presented to the city council, what was referred from the city council, we have some updates in the table of use regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3121.496s">We</a>  have updates to the table of dimensional requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3127.68s">We</a>  are going to go to the, these were already proposed changes from previous community development boards that you've already seen. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3135.624s">So</a>  I'm also going to go faster <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3139.066s">Some</a>  another for the table dimensional requirements, adding the green score section. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3148.093s">We</a>  have some definitions to be defined or adjust about the defining historic conversion. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3156.899s">And</a>  so in this case, we just added the amount of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3161.322s">And</a>  then we have some historic conversion user standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3164.784s">And</a>  these are the new proposed changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3166.485s">So</a>  what we've seen in the previous community development board, we have come to other changes, and these are the ones that you see in blue. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3176.127s">We</a>  have in the table of dimensional requirements, some more for the building coverage, and then previous surface and open landscape, adding some small extra definition in the historic conversion. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3191.872s">and</a>  changing some of the use of standards for the historic conversion. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3196.174s">And</a>  then the urban residential, too, to have the incentive zoning from three to as incentive zoning one more story.</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3208.771s">And</a>  again, these were in the slide deck for May 21. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3212.513s">So</a>  we assume that people have been able to see them. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3215.835s">I</a>  thank everybody for their patience, we know that whenever we do these meetings, there are some people who are joining for the first time, we wanted to make sure that everybody had the same set of information, but thank you all to your patience. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3227.581s">We</a>  are delighted to listen to comments from the board and to the from the community.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3249.048s">Yeah,</a>  so now I'm going to open it up to the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3250.669s">This</a>  is questions from the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3253.091s">We're</a>  not going to really be deliberating because I think we should deliberate after hearing public comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3258.894s">So</a>  John, yeah, if you have any questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3261.856s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[John Anderson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3263.797s">The</a>  term transit station is a bus stop, a transit station.</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3270.612s">can</a>  you confirm? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3272.833s">It</a>  is our understanding that a bus stop is not a transit station. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3277.136s">It</a>  is the point at which the bus embarks from a fixed point and its destination, but it is not the stops in between. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3284.64s">That</a>  is our current understanding.</p>

    <p>[John Anderson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3286.141s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3288.323s">What</a>  is meant by facade build out?</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3290.664s">Um,</a>  yeah, so the facade build out is the <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3299.864s">When</a>  you see the frontage line, the frontage is the line that connects the lot with the main street, that intersection, that is the frontage line. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3315.968s">And</a>  so the build-out facade is the main facade of your building that is looking towards the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3322.989s">There</a>  is at least 60% of that frontage to have that building, that build-up. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3330.412s">Is</a>  that a little clear? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3331.713s">I</a>  can also take a diagram that we have that I can look for you and put it up, if that helps.</p>

    <p>[John Anderson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3339.759s">So</a>  you're saying it's a percentage of the frontage? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3344.062s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3344.682s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3345.463s">And</a>  I'm sure this is kind of complicated, but very briefly, could you say what's involved in the green requirements?</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3355.485s">The</a>  green score, yeah, so we have a menu that they can choose from. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3360.027s">It's</a>  only the green requirements for the green score. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3364.189s">It's</a>  only for the UR2 and our only projects that are going through the site plan review, so bigger impact projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3371.433s">And</a>  so you have a menu of choices that you can get from green roofs, green facades, rain gardens that will give you having trees, maintaining existing trees, <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3384.999s">and</a>  gives you some points towards the minimum of those 25 that you need to get.</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3393.003s">I'm</a>  sorry, the city has already passed the green score. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3396.205s">It</a>  came to the Community Development Board late last year, early this year, and the City Council has passed that one already.</p>

    <p>[John Anderson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3403.649s">Last</a>  question, I noticed on a number of the zones there, you talked about going from two and a half to three stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3414.213s">Excuse</a>  me, you talked about the number of stories and they were still at two and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3422.24s">Are</a>  there zones that still have changed from two and a half to three stories height? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3430.426s">I'm</a>  sorry, maybe I wasn't clear there.</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3433.097s">So</a>  in your current zoning, your single family is 2 1⁄2 maximum, and your duplex is 2 1⁄2. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3440.763s">And</a>  then multifamily, depending on the intensity that is A or B category, you have three or six. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3448.57s">So</a>  what we are proposing now, also because Medford zoning is the dimensional requirements are by use and not by district, so that is a little bit different. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3461.18s">And</a>  so right now we are proposing by district. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3464.421s">So</a>  your inner one and or two that goes 2.5. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3467.342s">So</a>  you're a single family duplex. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3470.503s">And</a>  then when we go to enter three, you are one. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3474.504s">It's</a>  three. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3475.484s">And</a>  also you are two is three. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3477.845s">We're</a>  just in one of the recommendations is that you are to <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3484.328s">it</a>  has also the incentive zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3486.871s">So</a>  if they go through incentive zoning and give something back to the community from that many of choices, they could increase from three to four. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3496.441s">So</a>  those are the changes that we've made.</p>

    <p>[John Anderson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3498.624s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3505.413s">questions.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3505.633s">Ben.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3505.733s">Do</a>  you have any questions?</p>

    <p>[Ben Lavallee]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3506.514s">Yeah</a>  I don't want to jump in front of people that might be on the zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3509.595s">I</a>  have one question. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3510.556s">Um</a>  and the motivation for the question is that the majority of the proposed and our one zoning seems to be where there's a lot of private ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3521.782s">And</a>  so my question is, has any public input been <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3534.196s">A</a>  lot of the private ways in the city are not in great shape. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3537.218s">I</a>  actually, I don't know, I don't live on one, but I would imagine that some residents would welcome the city's participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3544.603s">Some</a>  may not, but I'm wondering if that, if we're going to consider such broad zoning changes, whether that has been part of the calculus or not.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3571.103s">So</a>  converting private ways to public ways is a complicated process. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3578.687s">And</a>  so there has been conversations among people who live on them when issues have come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3584.149s">But</a>  each road that wants to go from being a private way to a public way has to have a deed search to understand what the ownership of the actual road parcels are. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3596.034s">and</a>  then there has to be an understanding and delineation of where the public versus private would be, which involves surveys. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3603.476s">And</a>  then the roads need to be brought up to city standards or they need to have a funding source designated a way, a plan for bringing them up to public standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3615.118s">We</a>  have a lot of information actually on the city's website about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3618.699s">This</a>  has come up in areas in particular where there's already permit parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3623.8s">Um</a>  and people on private ways cannot have city permit parking because we can't enforce that But they do have they can sign them themselves and they can actually have vehicles towed themselves off of private ways And so that information and the details the legal requirements there are on the city's website on the parking page Which I can share to the people on zoom for people in the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3647.381s">It's</a>  a little bit harder for me to provide that link <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3650.563s">Um,</a>  but that's sort of the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3653.164s">I</a>  will tell you that as new roads are being built, um, this board actually is the one who approved subdivisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3660.907s">And</a>  we require that they get built to public way standards, whether or not they're going to be turned over as a public way. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3668.71s">Um,</a>  and there are two examples of that recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3673.77s">Um,</a>  Mary Kenny way by the high school, sometimes fondly known as the gravel pit that was designed to public way standards and will become a public way. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3682.636s">The</a>  newer one that was approved can't become a public way because it only connects to a private way and public ways have to connect to public ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3692.602s">And</a>  so since it only goes to a private way, that new cul-de-sac will be a private way, but will be built to city standards because this board would not approve a new road that was not built to city standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3705.169s">I</a>  don't know if that fully answers your question. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3707.971s">It's</a>  a lot of information.</p>

    <p>[Ben Lavallee]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3709.171s">It</a>  does. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3710.432s">I</a>  just would put out there that if we're looking at such comprehensive changes to our city, it might be a public dialogue that's worth having.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3722.378s">And</a>  if I'll add, that's one of the reasons why there are a number of neighborhoods <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3726.76s">that</a>  are very heavy private ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3729.922s">And</a>  those neighborhoods are being recommended to stay NR1 so that their only increased density would be an ADU. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3737.185s">And</a>  the only optional one would be a special permit ADU, which would be worthy of thinking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3744.429s">So</a>  there are some neighborhoods where people have questioned why are they recommended to stay NR1 or only single family. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3751.533s">And</a>  it's because they're predominantly private way neighborhoods.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3760.53s">John</a>  or Ben, any additional thoughts? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3762.371s">I</a>  do see that Vice Chair Peter Calves has his hand raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3766.833s">Peter?</a> </p>

    <p>[Peter Calves]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3769.315s">Yes,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3770.775s">The</a>  question, and I know some people know that we've spent a lot of time on the lot build outs, but it was very prominent in the city's advertising for this meeting, so I just wanted to get it down pretty <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3789.869s">pretty</a>  clearly immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3791.27s">Looking</a>  at your list of the potential number of units, say, I believe this was for NR3, it looks like the units were three units plus one ADU plus a special permit ADU. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3819.936s">implies</a>  to me that a building could only build up to four units before it would come before this board and need approval that would require a butter notification and public input and stuff like that, whereas I feel like I was seeing information before this meeting that you could get up to six units in that kind of building. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3844.247s">And</a>  I just want to make sure before we move forward where <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3850.153s">Dissonance</a>  comes from if I just read something wrong.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3855.573s">And</a>  please feel free to bring up the tables, the visuals from before.</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3858.996s">Do</a>  you want to bring it up? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3861.998s">It</a>  may have been a misunderstanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3863.479s">We've</a>  heard a couple of other public comments to the process of a misunderstanding of what can go on which lot, which is one of the reasons we've done the table this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3875.208s">So</a>  you are correct in reading it now. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3878.151s">So</a>  in the NR3, you can have a table <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3882.914s">the</a>  single unit, the two unit, the three unit, or the historic conversion, you are allowed a protected ADU because there is a single unit, and that would be an as of right ADU per state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3894.677s">So</a>  say you had a three unit dwelling, as was just brought up now, you could add a protected ADU, which is the one under the state law as of right. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3905.019s">So</a>  now that gives you the three unit, <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3907.52s">plus</a>  the ADU which is size restricted so it doesn't become a four unit under zoning it's a three you plus the ADU. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3915.245s">And</a>  then if you wanted to add one more, it would be a special permit, so that brings it that would with, and that would bring it before the board, as was correctly said so three three unit dwelling, plus an ADU, a second ADU brings it to a special permit which brings it to the community development board. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3934.598s">And</a>  so you can see on here the protected at us in our one, two and three are all as of right those are the state required at us. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3944.104s">You</a>  are one and you are to do not allow single family as a right or by special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3950.147s">So</a>  that means they're not considered single family districts under the law so to keep the single unit to unit and three units consistent with the neighborhood residential <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3961.193s">There</a>  is a local at you as a right for those that means that the multiplex the town and the townhouse building types are not allowed to have a local at you they are also not allowed to have a special permit at you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3977.105s">So</a>  in all of these districts, you can have up to two units as one unit as a right one unit by one at you as a right one at you by special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3988.573s">but</a>  only if you are a one, two, or three unit dwelling.</p>

    <p>[Peter Calves]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3994.636s">Thank</a>  you for that clarification, because like I said, as you said previously, this has been a long process. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=3999.339s">There's</a>  a lot of numbers flying around, and some of them have actually changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4003.261s">So</a>  I just wanted to get that clarification, because I know for a lot of the public discourse around this has been about how <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4011.838s">how</a>  many things can spring up by right without public input. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4015.761s">And</a>  I wanted to make sure that we have that number set. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4019.765s">So</a>  thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4020.445s">You're</a>  welcome.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4026.19s">Adam</a>  or Ari, do you have any questions before we move into the public comment? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4031.935s">Oh,</a>  I see your hand raised.</p>

    <p>[Adam Behrens]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4032.635s">I</a>  did, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4034.077s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4036.477s">I</a>  read through the public comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4039.078s">I</a>  think one of the things that's a little bit hard with zoning in particular is to just understand the timescale at which a lot of these changes will happen, in which a community then evolves from where it is today into the future state that's envisioned by zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4059.743s">And</a>  so I was just curious from Innis and Associates, it sounds like you guys have done a lot of this work for other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4067.571s">Just</a>  whether there was information or a case study on cities that might be similar to Medford, and what kind of timeline and scale in terms of build out. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4081.404s">And</a>  so in a neighborhood, <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4083.206s">You</a>  know, with a lot of concerns, I think, from the West Medford neighborhood about going from single family to urban residential, just like helping better understand how fast does that usually happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4096.333s">How,</a>  you know, what percentage of the lots tend to fill out to the maximum capacity that's allowed? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4103.977s">So</a>  is this like a five-year time frame? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4107.1s">Is</a>  this a 10-year time frame? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4108.461s">Is</a>  this a 20-year time frame? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4110.764s">Would</a>  just be helpful, I think, for me and maybe some people in the community to just intuitively understand this process.</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4123.055s">Madam</a>  Chair? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4125.252s">Yes,</a>  please. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4127.534s">Thank</a>  you for that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4128.634s">I</a>  can understand how my being able to give you a very specific answer would be helpful to a lot of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4136.9s">Unfortunately,</a>  development is <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4141.763s">There's</a>  a lot of factors that go into development beyond the zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4144.765s">So</a>  the neighborhood within a city, the city itself, the economic climate that the development is happening in, so in a high interest rate environment, in an environment where <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4162.136s">There</a>  are fewer subsidies for fewer people wanting to invest, makes it more difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4170.039s">So</a>  I don't know that there is a comparable study that says this exact type of neighborhood would fill out. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4177.503s">It</a>  also very much depends on whether or not a neighborhood already has a lot of buildings in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4182.905s">And</a>  it's also dependent on who owns that property, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4187.287s">Zoning</a>  offers a choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4189.608s">It</a>  doesn't say you property owner own this it's it's it's single family now you can now go up to three units you must go up to three units. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4198.194s">It</a>  is always an option for the property owner and I realized that in some neighborhoods, people know their neighbors well and they know that there hasn't been a lot of change and others are have been changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4211.422s">both</a>  in the city and others. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4213.223s">I</a>  was talking with the community this morning that we have another another city in Massachusetts that we helped with some zoning that would have allowed multifamily. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4221.906s">They</a>  received absolutely no applications. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4224.568s">Other</a>  communities have allowed made zoning changes and they get something a little bit more immediate. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4231.25s">But</a>  there's also the issue of how much housing can be absorbed in one area over a period of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4238.957s">So</a>  I would love to say that there's an easy answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4241.179s">I</a>  hope just by giving you kind of a picture into the different things that people understand that's not an easy answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4249.647s">When</a>  we think of zoning, we think of it as something that will happen over 10, 20, 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4256.512s">But</a>  some of that could happen immediately, and some of it could happen fairly down the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4260.915s">So</a>  it is not an easy answer to give, and I do understand how frustrating that is.</p>

    <p>[Adam Behrens]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4267.98s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4273.103s">Thanks,</a>  Adam. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4274.144s">Mari,</a>  did you have any questions?</p>

    <p>[Ari Fishman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4278.066s">No,</a>  thank you, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4279.987s">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4287.051s">So</a>  the next item on our agenda, which I understand everybody is eagerly anticipating, as am I, is the public comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4298.066s">We</a>  do have a sign-up sheet at the back of the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4300.348s">If</a>  you know you want to comment, we already have two pages up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4304.731s">But,</a>  you know, please add your name to the back or to the sheet in the back. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4309.815s">If</a>  you have joined us via Zoom, please feel free to raise your hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4313.458s">I</a>  think we're going to kind of like alternate, maybe do like a couple in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4318.422s">one</a>  or two on Zoom, depending on how many people we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4322.824s">Looks</a>  like we have, I don't have the latest sign-up sheet, but we have 30 up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4326.525s">We</a>  have a dozen hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4330.846s">So</a>  let me see. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4333.867s">I'm</a>  just going to do some quick math.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4345.331s">Everybody</a>  should see it almost.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4347.532s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4350.222s">So</a>  I'm gonna say we're gonna give each person two minutes, and that's kind of like a plus or minus. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4357.163s">If</a>  you've joined our Zoom meetings before, we want you to finish your thought, finish your question, but please be considerate. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4366.005s">We</a>  do have a lot of people here tonight, and our goal is to try to get as much public comment as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4370.966s">Again,</a>  if we can't get through all the public comment tonight, we do have an option to continue to a date certain. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4376.807s">So</a>  just wanna prepare everyone that that is a potential outcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4384.148s">And</a>  as a reminder, this is the fourth meeting for the continued public hearing that was opened on April 2nd regarding the proposed zoning amendment for the creation of neighborhood and urban residential zoning districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4395.412s">So</a>  we've heard a lot, but we want to keep hearing from you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4401.314s">I</a>  do need to state for the record that Adam Behrens has watched recordings of missed meetings and he has signed the Mullen Affidavit. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4413.798s">So</a>  he is now eligible to vote if we do move this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4423.2s">So</a>  I'm now going to open the public comment period. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4425.801s">This</a>  is a combination for the accessory dwelling units, as well as the neighborhood and urban residential zoning districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4437.808s">Those</a>  who wish to provide comments can either sign up on the form in the back. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4444.291s">We'll</a>  also have a period where you can just walk up to the front, but we're going to try to honor the people that have signed up first, as well as through Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4453.928s">If</a>  you're on Zoom, use the raise hand feature. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4456.431s">You</a>  can also send an email to OCD at MedfordMA.gov. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4460.355s">Before</a>  providing your comments, please state your name and if you're comfortable, your address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4465.621s">A</a>  reminder to all meeting participants on Zoom to please refrain from using the chat function. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4471.868s">as</a>  it's not part of the public record. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4474.392s">If</a>  you do have audio or technical difficulties on Zoom, please message Jack Podolsky, one of our fearless interns, who will do their best to support you in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4493.38s">And</a>  a quick note because I feel like a couple of past meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4496.641s">We've</a>  had a pretty solid back and forth during the public comments, which I truly enjoy, but we want to try to get through as many people as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4507.143s">The</a>  consultants in the city staff might not be responding to every question that is asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4512.664s">I</a>  may highlight some questions that I'd like them to ask board members present. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4518.038s">in</a>  the chambers as well as on zoom may highlight a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4520.861s">I</a>  know I have to say all this. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4524.184s">I</a>  appreciate everyone's patience. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4527.446s">But</a>  if one of your questions is not answered, you will be able to check in with city staff and we'll get to it.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4535.794s">Let's</a>  see.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4538.457s">I</a>  know we said a break around 8 15. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4540.399s">Um,</a>  it doesn't feel like the right time. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4543.181s">Yeah,</a>  let's just get into it, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4546.424s">Okay,</a>  so, uh, the first three public commenters that I have in person, please feel free to line up are Nick Oleg. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4555.771s">Mike</a>  Corbett and Laura Sela Marriott. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4562.176s">And</a>  I apologize for any mispronunciation. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4568.235s">I</a>  was going to do like a group because we have more. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4570.396s">Hi,</a>  Nick.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4576.299s">Hi,</a>  checking the mic.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4578.281s">Alicia</a>  is going to manage the timer and she'll raise hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4584.504s">I'll</a>  have her raise her hand when it's about like 30 seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4587.626s">Again,</a>  you'll be able to finish your thought, but please respect the time.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4591.007s">Okay,</a>  thanks. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4593.441s">I</a>  live at 62 Tainer Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4595.862s">I</a>  just want to state that I'm very strongly in favor of the proposed rezoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4599.663s">I</a>  believe that the huge amount of work that the CDB, the zoning consultants and city council have done has resulted in a plan that largely gets it right. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4607.306s">It</a>  sets Medford up well for future growth while ensuring that the newly allowed densification is spread out across the city and not simply concentrated in a few areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4615.929s">Change</a>  can be difficult, but resistance to change has its own costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4620.05s">Metro</a>  Boston and Massachusetts are currently in the midst of a housing crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4623.755s">Exclusionary</a>  zoning has played a major part in this, and we must move beyond this outdated and ineffective practice if we are truly to meet the moment and address this crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4632.325s">We</a>  don't just have this power, we have this responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4635.819s">change</a>  also comes with positives. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4637.761s">More</a>  allowable density and more mixed use zoning mean more local businesses, more walkability, a broader tax base, more children in neighborhood schools, more friends and neighbors at block parties. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4647.909s">I</a>  live in an area that would be up zoned to NR3 under the current plan, and which is immediately next to the Salem Street Corridor. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4654.394s">And</a>  I'm excited to see what the future holds for my neighborhood as it welcomes new owners, new renters, new businesses over the next few years and the coming decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4664.048s">These</a>  plans have been developed with great care and a considerable amount of public consultation. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4668.031s">It</a>  may not be perfect, no plan is, but it is a good one. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4672.334s">And</a>  this is not the time to slow down or stop such an important and carefully considered policy measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4677.658s">After</a>  years of zoning recodifications, comprehensive climate, housing and production, housing and, excuse me, comprehensive planning, climate plan and housing plan development, <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4689.873s">consultations</a>  and discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4691.937s">We</a>  are ready as a city to take this step forward and we must not falter. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4695.123s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4702.205s">Hi,</a>  Mike.</p>

    <p>[Michael Corbett]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4703.165s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4703.585s">Hi,</a>  everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4704.106s">I'm</a>  Mike Corbett. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4705.106s">I</a>  live at 26 Jackson Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4708.267s">So</a>  first of all, I just want to issue a state of gratefulness and thank you to the Community Development Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4714.809s">I</a>  know this is hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4716.53s">I</a>  know it requires connecting with a lot of people in the city, and I just want to appreciate also the great work that NS has done. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4722.492s">There's</a>  a lot of information and a lot of slide decks. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4725.774s">I</a>  unfortunately only started digging into this less than a week ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4730.438s">So</a>  I wanted to start just introduce myself real quickly because I think it's two relevant things. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4735.383s">Number</a>  one, I'm an engineer, I've been working in engineering and construction for over 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4740.969s">And</a>  number two, I've been working in sustainable technologies for the last 15 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4745.273s">And</a>  I bring this up, number one, because I have a relevant background to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4749.936s">I</a>  think, for example, the graphics that Ennis showed today on the frontage and the lot sizes, that is now in a form that a lot of the public can understand, whereas somebody like myself can read through it and kind of get that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4761.524s">And</a>  so I think we need more of that for the community to understand what these things mean. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4766.867s">The</a>  second point is, I've issued some notes to the City Council and the Community Development Board on the record that I think were received as if I'm a not-in-my-backyard conservative person. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4777.417s">I'm</a>  actually quite progressive. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4779.179s">I</a>  believe in an increase in housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4780.961s">I</a>  believe we need this, but I believe we need to do this thoughtfully and connecting with the community to make sure that people understand what they're signing up for. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4790.95s">So</a>  I just found out about this a week ago, as I said, I was lucky enough to have given myself a Father's Day present of taking Friday and Monday off, which I spent as well as Saturday and Sunday digging into every piece of information on the website, asking for more additional information that I could not find on the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4812.621s">And</a>  even with my relative background, <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4815.042s">and</a>  two days to dig through this, I still need more time. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4818.623s">And</a>  I think the rest of the community feels this way as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4821.404s">The</a>  last thing that I'm going to add, the reason why I'm worried is developers coming in and taking advantage of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4828.006s">I've</a>  been on the other side of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4830.187s">It's</a>  a three-step process. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4831.567s">Step</a>  one is finding out, okay, what's the zoning? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4834.288s">What</a>  can I do? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4835.528s">Step</a>  two is looking at the history of the Zoning Board of Appeals and how quickly do they give out appeals. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4841.437s">City</a>  of Medford's Zoning Board of Appeals has approved 24 of the last 24 variance requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4849.789s">And</a>  step three... <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4852.045s">is</a>  then looking at how lenient the building department is. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4855.706s">And</a>  so unless Medford is looking at this holistically, determining how to staff the Zoning Board of Appeals, how to staff the building department to deal with the influx of most likely variance requests and building approvals, we're not going to be ready for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4871.592s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4871.952s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_44]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4880.314s">Hi,</a>  Laura. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4881.655s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4883.69s">Good</a>  evening, Madam Chair and members of the Medford Community Development Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4888.354s">My</a>  name is Laura Chalamet and I live at 1 Arden Road in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4893.8s">I'm</a>  here to speak in favor of the proposed neighborhood and urban residential zoning changes before the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4901.487s">The</a>  proposed changes ensure that Medford is a welcoming and vibrant city with improved access for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4908.88s">It</a>  puts the right kind of density in the right locations, those being main streets, transit hubs, and city squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4919.027s">The</a>  mixed-use provisions will allow Medford to support local businesses and provide much-needed housing, which together create vibrant neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4931.314s">These</a>  changes will better position Medford to meet goals set forth in the housing production plan by reducing barriers to multifamily and mixed use housing development. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4942.563s">It</a>  will also allow for a diversity of housing types, including the missing middle and affordable rental and affordable homeownership options. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4954.02s">Above</a>  all, the proposed zoning change will allow us to maintain the safety and the character of Medford while providing for economic and population growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4965.108s">Medford</a>  will continue to grow. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4968.01s">This</a>  plan ensures it will continue to thrive. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4971.212s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4977.535s">We're</a>  now going to take three users from Zoom, but for in-person, the next three that we have are Laura Punnett, Trish Schiapelli, and Peter MacDonald. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4990.776s">You</a>  can stay in your seats or you can line up. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4992.077s">It's</a>  up to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4992.657s">You're</a>  going to have at least six minutes before you have to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4996.278s">Just</a>  try to keep things moving. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=4999.6s">And</a>  request for the Zoom participants, if you are able to update your name to a name rather than iPhone or a number or something else, that just helps us kind of keep track of who's spoken and make sure that you know you're being called on.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_30]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5018.015s">you.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5018.115s">Um</a>  Alicia, would you mind? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5019.136s">I'm</a>  meeting people.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5020.517s">I</a>  was just gonna do it right in order. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5023.059s">So</a>  the first zoom commenter that we have is, uh, 17816. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5027.582s">Please</a>  state your name and address if you're comfortable for the record.</p>

    <p>[Jim Doherty]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5041.542s">Can</a>  you hear me?</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5043.623s">All</a>  right, we're unable to hear 17816. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5044.903s">We're</a>  going to mute them and we'll come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5049.365s">The</a>  next zoom commenter we have is Alyssa Dedick.</p>

    <p>[Christopher Dedic]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5056.947s">Yeah,</a>  this is Chris and Alyssa Dedick from 131 Yale Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5063.65s">Can</a>  you guys hear me?</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5066.311s">Yes,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Christopher Dedic]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5067.732s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5068.832s">I'm</a>  here with my wife as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5070.853s">We're</a>  both in, I just wanna say thank you for all your work and we're both in strong support of all of the proposed plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5078.175s">And</a>  we just had a quick question about the building allotment and the building coverage that you guys talked about with the new images earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5091.099s">I</a>  guess just for reference, the 60% is, <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5096.57s">is</a>  basically like FAR and not like ground level coverage, I guess is the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5101.954s">So</a>  an example would be if you had like a 10,000 square foot lot with the 60% coverage, would that be like 6,000 square foot on the lot? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5114.203s">Or</a>  like if it's a three stories, it would be 2,000, 2,000, 2,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5116.925s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5117.785s">Chris,</a>  do you have any additional questions or comments? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5128.212s">Was</a>  that a yes?</p>

    <p>[Christopher Dedic]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5130.201s">No,</a>  no, that no.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5132.072s">Okay,</a>  okay, great. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5133.453s">I</a>  do think that's a good question. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5134.894s">Just</a>  for clarification.</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5138.778s">Through</a>  you, Madam Chair, it is not FAR. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5141.56s">So</a>  FAR is floor area ratio, and it refers to the ratio between the lot area and the square footage, the gross square footage of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5151.708s">This</a>  is just referring to the lot area. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5153.91s">So</a>  the coverage is 60% of the ground plane or the lot area.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5160.862s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5162.343s">The</a>  next zoom commenter we have Claire Mcgorian. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5171.351s">Hello.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5171.771s">Can</a>  you hear me? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5173.473s">Yes,</a>  we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5173.953s">Thank</a>  you, Claire.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5174.894s">Oh,</a>  terrific. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5176.215s">Um,</a>  hi. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5177.276s">Um,</a>  I live at, uh, 82 and 84 Stanley Avenue with my partner, Donna McCormick. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5183.401s">We</a>  have lived here for 25 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5185.303s">It's</a>  our first and only home that we've lived in. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5188.347s">It's</a>  a two family and until just a few years ago when COVID hit, we did have tenants, all of whom are great, I have to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5196.689s">So</a>  that's good news. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5198.889s">It's</a>  an amazing neighborhood, the whole neighborhood, but Stanley Ave in particular and our end of it, which is close to College Ave, we have had the same neighbors, at least the immediate ones, and even other ones that we know down the street for almost that entire time. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5213.352s">It's</a>  zoned, as far as I know, for single family and two family only. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5218.914s">I</a>  think the lots are, you know, they're all on the small side. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5222.457s">I</a>  think ours is under 4,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5224.258s">I</a>  suspect the other ones are too, but I didn't look at my deed. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5227.001s">And</a>  so I'm a little confused about the proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5230.844s">I</a>  have to say, I don't think the notification around this was very good because I get every call from the mayor's office and from all the stuff in Medford, and I just heard about this a few days ago, but I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5244.416s">But</a>  I do fear, you know, what this means. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5247.197s">So</a>  I guess I would one likes, you know, the fear about quality of life, which we have really enjoyed and possibly safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5254.181s">I</a>  don't say that it automatically means anything bad, but this has been such a safe neighborhood for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5259.304s">I</a>  hate to say we've left our keys in the door for longer than I should tell you and never had a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5264.907s">So,</a>  and the other fear is about the value of our home. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5268.409s">I</a>  just don't know how these kinds of changes could affect it possibly adversely. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5273.492s">So</a>  what I want to know on a street like ours is, what is the greatest, I'm sorry, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5279.818s">So</a>  if someone can answer this question for me, what is the greatest change that could happen on this street where it's single family, public street, single family and two family, small lots, again, I think they're under 4,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5294.37s">Am</a>  I understanding correctly that this street, they could convert those to three story buildings or is that incorrect?</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5304.663s">Paola</a>  and Emily, did you get the street name that Claire mentioned? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5308.244s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5313.405s">Are</a>  you able to answer what the updated zoning would be?</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5317.206s">I</a>  turned the mic on, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5323.027s">So</a>  she is in the UR1 district. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5328.368s">Or</a>  in the proposed UR1 district, I should say. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5331.129s">So</a>  that'd be a pretty big change. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5334.352s">It</a>  is. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5334.712s">It</a>  is bigger from she's general residential at the moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5338.656s">That's</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5340.717s">We're</a>  just confirming what she has at the moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5342.439s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5344.16s">For</a>  anybody who wants to follow along, we are using the interactive map. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5349.585s">She's</a>  general residential at the moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5351.466s">And</a>  if you click on her, did we get her property number? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5354.849s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5356.01s">We</a>  can't give you the exact.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5357.671s">It's</a>  82 to 84 Stanley Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5360.313s">You</a>  need that.</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5362.538s">Thank</a>  you, Claire.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5363.078s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5363.739s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5364.039s">So</a>  the current record actually need to turn it so I can see it.</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5382.723s">The</a>  current so her current lot size is 3250. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5386.505s">The</a>  minimum, the new minimum lot size would be 4000 so she would actually still be non conforming, because her lot size is smaller. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5399.432s">Building</a>  height is currently to the allowable zoning so her, her current. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5406.216s">current</a>  zoning is 6000 square foot lot size, it would be under the new one 4000 so she's currently non conforming for both building height is currently to existing her zoning is 2.5, it would be allowed as a three. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5424.686s">There's</a>  changes to building coverage between what she has and what would be allowed but essentially she's not conforming now.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5431.526s">So</a>  I don't want to interrupt and take time, but I'm so sorry, Claire.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5435.388s">We</a>  have a two minute limit. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5437.368s">But</a>  I did want to mention to anybody that has specific questions about their own property, Alicia, Danielle, Emily from Innes Associates, as well as Christian will be at Circle the Square this Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5449.894s">So</a>  that might be a good time to kind of dig into individual kind of property questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5457.617s">and</a>  maybe drive through the interactive zoning map as well.</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5464.559s">Yes,</a>  we will have that with us, just to answer that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5466.76s">So</a>  anybody with individual questions, we'd be happy to go through that with them on Saturday.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5472.601s">OK,</a>  and we're going to go back to Jim, our first Zoom commenter. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5478.623s">Jim,</a>  are you able to chat with us?</p>

    <p>[Jim Doherty]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5481.984s">OK,</a>  can you hear me this time?</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5484.205s">Yes,</a>  we can hear you.</p>

    <p>[Jim Doherty]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5485.475s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5485.816s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5486.176s">I</a>  appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5488.139s">I'm</a>  just a little confused on a name and name and address for the record if you don't mind.</p>

    <p>[Jim Doherty]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5493.528s">Jim</a>  Doherty, Arlington Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5497.506s">I'm</a>  a little confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5499.867s">So</a>  we've had two meetings regarding the West Medford zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5506.349s">They</a>  were both postponed because there wasn't a quorum. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5510.49s">And</a>  the last meeting on the 4th, we were going to discuss it tonight, but it seems like that's kind of fallen by the wayside and we're now having a more globalistic conversation of everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5524.075s">I</a>  like one of the previous speakers who took a lot of time to do the research. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5529.58s">I</a>  raised a concern because to the contrary, I agree with a lot of the previous speakers. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5535.685s">We</a>  do need density and we need to do updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5539.008s">But</a>  the reasoning behind the area between Boston Ave and Mystic River Road <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5548.585s">First,</a>  we were told it wasn't in the quarter mile. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5551.146s">There</a>  wasn't enough transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5552.987s">The</a>  train only came twice on Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5556.989s">I</a>  provided a great deal of information about we have probably more than many parts of Medford, more transportation there. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5567.054s">I</a>  then, at the next meeting, was advised that the staff elected not to <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5574.058s">make</a>  any changes on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5575.94s">And</a>  the decision was based because it's historically quote unquote, a black neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5582.086s">I</a>  raised a major objection with that the Supreme I've done research on that as well as Supreme Court has ruled against that kind of zoning criteria going back to the early 1900s. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5592.096s">I</a>  then I then followed up <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5596.533s">with</a>  another email explaining the difference in the housing stock in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5603.396s">And</a>  so I've spent a lot of time on this as well, but it seems we get no feedback and I'm at a loss. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5612.44s">Why,</a>  where is the information going? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5615.542s">And</a>  why are we not getting any feedback? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5617.523s">I've</a>  never had the courtesy of response to either one of those emails. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5621.065s">And</a>  now I feel like we're being thrown in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5623.886s">And</a>  Wes Medford is not getting a due conversation, whether many parts of it and I agree with some of the speakers, you're making a huge jump from Jim, I'm going to ask you to wrap up your comment, if you don't mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5636.192s">No</a>  problem, I will in one second, within 10 seconds, is you're doing a lot of single-family homes going all the way to UR1. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5645.34s">We</a>  were always a GR district, which allowed for a three-family, and we're basically stagnant, and we're being disproportionately affected in comparison to other areas of the city, and I've pointed that out in my email. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5661.273s">Thank</a>  you for your time, but I think we need to get a little attention, both pro and con of what's taking place over in that area.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5672.458s">Thank</a>  you, Jim. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5672.898s">I</a>  appreciate your comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5675.179s">We're</a>  now going to move to the in-person commenters. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5679.12s">So</a>  that was Laura Punnett, Trish Ciapelli, and Peter MacDonald. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5688.738s">Hi,</a>  Trish. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5689.099s">It's</a>  nice to see you in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5691.642s">I'm</a>  Laura. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5692.643s">Oh,</a>  then Laura Panet. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5694.605s">I'm</a>  sorry, Laura. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5695.726s">It's</a>  nice to see you in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5698.089s">Sorry,</a>  it's been a long day. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5699.07s">As</a>  I can imagine, it has been for a lot of you.</p>

    <p>[8D6g1gdpE1E_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5701.413s">And</a>  it's going to be longer before you're getting to go home. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5704.277s">We're</a>  here for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5706.738s">My</a>  name is Laura Panet. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5708.479s">I</a>  live at 40 Tesla Avenue, and I've been a homeowner in Medford Hillside since 1987. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5716.465s">I'm</a>  here speaking also on behalf of my husband, Rafael Moreirazo. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5722.028s">and</a>  I'm just speaking about the district, the zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5725.691s">I'm</a>  here to express our strong support for the proposal for residential rezoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5732.677s">I'm</a>  in favor of increasing housing potential in my own neighborhood as well as throughout the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5738.141s">I</a>  and other Medford residents who I know want a more walkable city, more diversity, and more neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5747.649s">It's</a>  been my privilege to be a longtime homeowner, and I've really appreciated watching the city evolve over the years, but I can see that this opportunity is being closed to a whole generation of people, because we aren't building enough housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5763.551s">This</a>  shortage, and other speakers have mentioned it, the housing shortage has real impact on people's lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5769.096s">Not</a>  only that it drives up the cost of housing, but also it means that people's quality of life is affected. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5776.103s">People</a>  have to live farther and farther outside <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5780.307s">of</a>  Boston in order to find something affordable. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5784.071s">And</a>  so people have to commute long distances, which affects their time for families and hobbies and home maintenance and getting enough sleep. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5792.838s">This</a>  is actually my professional expertise. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5796.461s">And</a>  I could go on on this topic for quite a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5799.544s">But</a>  the point is we have room for more people right here in Medford, which could reduce some of that stress. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5805.209s">30</a>  seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5805.87s">I</a>  really believe that giving property owners the option to redevelop their property to add more housing is a win-win-win. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5813.4s">It</a>  increases the supply of homes, it gives the property owner more flexibility, and it grows the tax base with new growth so that we don't have to do another override in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5823.833s">I</a>  call on the board to recommend a pro-housing vision for Medford by reducing single family or NR1As, especially in northwest Medford to spread the density around. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5838.84s">And</a>  I also would really appreciate it, I know that you are trying to get input from as many people as possible, but it, <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5848.044s">really</a>  feels to me like it's time for the board to move forward and allow the city council to do their jobs rather than demanding that people show up over and over again to discuss this topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5861.554s">Thank</a>  you so much for your time.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5863.176s">Thank</a>  you, Laura.</p>

    <p>[Trish Schiapelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5870.684s">Good</a>  evening, Trisha Kelly, 53 Garfield Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5875.045s">So</a>  in my opinion, I agree that we do need more housing and we need a facelift in Medford and we do need to get up to date. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5882.449s">I</a>  do not think, however, that we have done enough thought process and strategic thinking on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5889.592s">My</a>  concern is that there's never been any conversation around what the infrastructure can handle with regard to electric. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5896.755s">sewer,</a>  water, all the lead pipes that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5900.236s">So</a>  I feel to add more density without really fixing some of the things that we have first is going to cause brownouts. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5909.59s">sewage</a>  backups during horrible, horrible storms and other issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5915.231s">So</a>  I think that we need to fix what we have and then be thoughtful and in a process and then bring people in. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5923.493s">What</a>  can the police handle? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5924.754s">We've</a>  never had a conversation around that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5926.774s">What</a>  can fire handle? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5928.315s">And</a>  why would you ever <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5930.075s">say</a>  that Medford, the gone are the days of the single family house, like some of the people on city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5936.58s">That</a>  is what Medford was built on. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5938.501s">And</a>  I feel like if the state can push back on the federal government for things they don't want to do, I believe that our city should be able to push back on the state with what the majority of homeowners, property owners, taxpayers and voters would like in the environment that they want to live. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5959.177s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5962.002s">Thank</a>  you, Chris. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5969.504s">Hi,</a>  Peter.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5969.984s">Hi,</a>  my name is Peter McDowell. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5971.545s">I</a>  live at 56 Otter Street, and I was blessed to work for the Medford Fire Department for 29 years.</p>

    <p>[Kaitlin Robinson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5977.73s">Thank</a>  you for your service.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5978.39s">I</a>  believe that I've been on every street in the city doing duties between emergency calls and routine check and hydrants and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5987.016s">My</a>  family's been in Medford for over 150 years, living in single family houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5992.12s">Luckily,</a>  we were blessed to have them. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=5995.033s">One</a>  of my great-great-grandparents, George Davenport, who the Davenport School was named after, was involved with George Wright and Middlesex Fells, preserving three square miles of Method out of eight square miles. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6008.536s">We're</a>  never gonna get more room. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6010.657s">If</a>  people wanna tear down all the woods, we can have another 30,000 people in the Middlesex Fells, but we decided a long time ago we needed some green space in the 1890s and the 1880s. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6024.638s">According</a>  to some of these, the state has passed the ADU. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6030.92s">So</a>  because of that, thousands of single family houses in Method are allowed to build an extra unit, which is increasing housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6040.844s">But</a>  on the call from City Hall that I got on my landline saying that <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6048.501s">4,000</a>  square foot lot could end up having three plus one units, or a family's lot is over 8,000 feet, that if it met all the requirements that there could be split and have three and three and another unit, that you're potentially putting eight units where there was a single family, and how is that fair to the other neighbors with single families that <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6076.438s">We</a>  can convert all these single families that are over 8,000 to eight units, but where's the fairness to the people who were here before? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6085.865s">We're</a>  gonna have the state mandate increasing thousands of units. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6091.069s">We</a>  have certain options that we've had thousands of units added in the past 20 years between River's Edge, <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6100.268s">Locust</a>  Street, and we have room for a lot more between Mystic Ave, the Parkway, this space where 15-story buildings are not imposed upon three-story neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6112.783s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6125.325s">So</a>  we're gonna move back to three Zoom commenters, and then three in-person. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6131.688s">The</a>  three in-person people that are on deck or in the hole, not really a sports person, are Alexander Pancic, Mary Louise O'Brien, and Page Buldini. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6144.233s">Feel</a>  free to stay in your seats, but just heads up that it's coming your way. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6148.975s">The</a>  next commenter we have on Zoom is Jeremy Martin. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6156.149s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Jeremy Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6157.83s">Good</a>  evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6159.17s">Jeremy</a>  Martin. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6159.87s">I</a>  live on Burgett Avenue in the Hillside neighborhood, probably one of the neighborhoods that will see some of the most drastic change from a predominant single family neighborhood to the potential of four and six units. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6172.574s">I'm</a>  very much in favor of this proposal, and I want to commend the city, the staff, the consultants for our process. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6181.557s">I</a>  disagree with some of the notions that this process hasn't been thoughtful, that people haven't been heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6186.641s">I've</a>  personally been to six meetings between the city council and the CDB, and I've both seen comments made and seen changes come out of them, and I appreciate that very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6198.79s">It's</a>  not a perfect process, and I've had my own frustrations, but I think that any sort of planning process of this ambition and this scale is not going to be perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6208.777s">We</a>  should not let <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6213.342s">that's</a>  really good. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6214.703s">Frankly,</a>  the change that people are concerned about too much <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6222.852s">Many</a>  of those things are already here. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6224.234s">The</a>  development is here. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6225.255s">The</a>  change is coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6226.817s">We</a>  need to take the opportunity to take control of that, to put some boundaries around it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6230.981s">And</a>  this is the opportunity to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6233.183s">The</a>  status quo is not working for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6236.847s">Just</a>  a couple of specific comments on the proposal, which I think is really good. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6243.274s">I</a>  would encourage, again, the potential for more development and more density to be located near primary open spaces of the Mystic River and the fells. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6254.945s">30</a>  seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6255.125s">That's</a>  going to give people the opportunity to live closer to those places. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6259.269s">I</a>  don't buy the argument about topography or dead ends or private ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6264.614s">that</a>  we're going to be able to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6265.736s">We're</a>  going to be able to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6267.078s">Precluding</a>  that right across the street from my house is a nearly 300 unit building going up on a very steep site. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6272.546s">The</a>  primary access to that <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6279.896s">And</a>  I hope we will eliminate the small pockets of urban residential 3 that are within NR1 areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6287.282s">Excuse</a>  me, I have it backwards. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6288.863s">Urban</a>  residential NR3 within UR1 areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6293.847s">And</a>  I hope that the staff find a way to apply more of the green score principles to residential development. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6300.312s">We</a>  need to find ways to stop developers from coming in, cutting down trees, and building big houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6305.376s">We</a>  don't have that in this proposal yet, and it's incredibly important.</p>

    <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6324.332s">Hi,</a>  I'm Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street, my neighborhood we zoned as NR3. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6331.214s">The</a>  zoning that is in the current filings folder didn't match the dimensional standards that were presented tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6336.356s">The</a>  building coverage among other things has changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6339.217s">It's</a>  hard for the public to consistently know what is actually on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6343.038s">The</a>  map from the city council is what was presented tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6346.299s">Is</a>  that the map that is now being considered? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6348.48s">Is</a>  all the density near the commuter rail and green line gone and reverted back? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6352.561s">to</a>  less than the density at Glenwood with no rapid transit and only one bus? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6357.765s">All</a>  the discussion of the negatives about density are centered on the least densely zoned areas and none about the more dense areas that already have some of the negatives, the less dense don't want, but we are being pushed further. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6371.796s">Why</a>  are only private roads in NR1 being kept less dense? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6375.499s">There</a>  are around 14 private streets in Glenwood and they all find themselves zoned at NR3 <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6380.763s">with</a>  no special attention paid to the fact they are also private ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6384.965s">If</a>  we are rolling back the areas with transit access, then Glenwood should not remain at or above their level of density. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6391.287s">We</a>  are already dense. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6392.567s">We</a>  already have flippers knocking on our doors to buy our lots that sell for lower prices because we are an EJ neighborhood and are being zoned to turn into a luxury urban neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6402.951s">The</a>  City has already said Glenwood is facing development pressure and that is why Salem Street Corridor was zoned first. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6409.014s">It</a>  will happen more quickly for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6411.314s">There</a>  were no studies on infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6413.735s">Going</a>  from one to two units in my neighborhood to three to five per lot will cause issues that we are not prepared for. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6421.038s">Parking</a>  minimum changes are already being discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6424.96s">So</a>  it is disingenuous for the consultants to suggest that parking is what will keep this zoning from actually happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6431.965s">This</a>  zoning will happen to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6433.846s">People</a>  will own cars, but they won't have parking for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6437.929s">Please</a>  do something about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6439.59s">Please</a>  send some time on Glenwood and not only talk about the NR1 and the NR2 areas, which will be markedly less dense than we will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6448.536s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6448.977s">Thank</a>  you, Cheryl.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6458.143s">And</a>  just to disambiguate, I think I heard a question over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6460.386s">EJ</a>  is environmental justice. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6462.268s">So</a>  she had used that acronym. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6472.06s">The</a>  next Zoom commenter that we have is Zoe.</p>

    <p>[Zoe Moutsos]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6478.077s">Hi,</a>  this is Zoe Moutzas from 33 Johnson Ave in West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6484.421s">This</a>  is my fourth meeting in this process, and I just want to say that the presentations get better every time, so thank you to Innes. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6493.406s">for</a>  continuing to give, give pictures where charts are getting very confusing for those of us who don't have a background in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6501.273s">So</a>  I really appreciate that and also really starting to put together the pieces of how the mixed use commercial zoning is fed by the neighborhood and residential zoning and I'm excited for what can happen in West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6518.168s">changes</a>  really hard, and I'm a little nervous about what might happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6522.109s">I'm</a>  in a zone that the City Council recommended as NR3, but the board has us tagged as UR1. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6532.032s">And</a>  today you shared a chart that really kind of highlighted the differences between that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6539.374s">And</a>  I did have a question, and it came up when Paola was talking about parking and how <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6547.216s">if</a>  you used a permeable surface for parking, you actually could fit a larger number of people or units into a space. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6556.6s">I</a>  had a question about what is permeable parking because is that dirt, pebbles? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6564.103s">What</a>  are we talking about? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6565.143s">Because</a>  I really feel like NR3 is appropriate for the Johnson Tyler Ave area. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6571.426s">We</a>  already have <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6574.607s">Some</a>  some 2 family homes here single family and it's a mix i think you are 1. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6579.59s">It</a>  to me feels a little bit over what i would feel comfortable with and that permeable parking made my ears perk up because i don't understand what that is but it kind of feels like it could. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6593.146s">maybe</a>  cheat at providing green space, which is actually what I'm very concerned about in our little, we live in an urban heat island, and I'm worried about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6604.508s">Overall,</a>  I think that this zoning, I'm excited for it to happen for all the reasons that people have said. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6610.67s">And</a>  I'm excited to get a more walkable, a little bit more dense Medford and to help alleviate some of the housing challenges that folks, you know, up and down the spectrum are having. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6621.092s">So</a>  thanks so much.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6624.059s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6624.439s">Thanks,</a>  Zoe. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6625.579s">Um,</a>  can we clarify what permeable papers are? <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6629.24s">Do</a>  we have a visual for it or just talk about it?</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6633.481s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6633.901s">So</a>  we are happy through the chair to define permeable surfaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6637.882s">It</a>  is not dirt. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6639.443s">Um,</a>  just to make that clear to everybody, it would have to be a structured parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6643.284s">And</a>  so surfaces that would be permeable permeable means that water can infiltrate through the surface. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6649.725s">So</a>  surface that would be permeable and acceptable for parking are defined in the green score but just a couple of them, gravel would be allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6657.396s">There</a>  are pavers that allow for permeability through that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6661.301s">So,</a>  those sorts of pavers, that would be acceptable.</p>

    <p>[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6665.823s">Yeah,</a>  you also have like the type of prefab tiles that go over grass. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6670.889s">Those,</a>  for example, provide enough structure for a car to go over and be permeable enough.</p>

    <p>[Emily Innes]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6676.797s">So</a>  those are what would be required for a permeable parking space for the question that we received. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6683.745s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Emily Hedeman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6690.677s">All</a>  right, we're back to our in-person commenters. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6693.227s">We</a>  have Alexander, Mary Louise, and Paige.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_57]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6698.243s">Hi,</a>  my name is Alexander Panchage. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6700.144s">I</a>  live at 12 Cushing Street, and that's also in the Glenwood area. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6705.346s">And</a>  I'm coming a little late to this, and I don't have prepared comments like so many other people have. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6714.13s">So</a>  I'll try to do my best here. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6715.271s">I'm</a>  concerned about a few things, especially in my area. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6720.713s">From</a>  what I understand, our area is right now basically two family houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6726.536s">and</a>  making it R3 allows someone to come into an existing structure, turn into four units, plus an ADU, plus another ADU, basically six units, without having any change to the parking, because it's already an existing structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6748.879s">I</a>  don't think that this is actually going to do what a lot of people think it's going to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6754.28s">I</a>  don't think that it's going to give more housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6756.801s">I</a>  think what's going to happen is a developer will come in, outbid anyone else who can buy the house because they will convert it into four units, plus one or plus two. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6770.083s">Then</a>  they will turn the ADU, <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6774.735s">into</a>  a B&B so they can rent that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6779.057s">And</a>  you'll basically have just a smaller unit that everyone's going to be paying the same amount of rent for. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6787.041s">So</a>  everyone will wind up just spending more money for less space and be more crowded. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6792.844s">30</a>  seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6798.303s">I</a>  think a lot of people are working from home now, and that does mean that they want a bigger space inside. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6806.688s">And</a>  I also agree that we've put in a thousand or more units already in Medford, and I don't think we should just ignore the fact that we have done that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hLm7uOhMYTQ&t=6816.673s">Thank</a>  you.</p>
