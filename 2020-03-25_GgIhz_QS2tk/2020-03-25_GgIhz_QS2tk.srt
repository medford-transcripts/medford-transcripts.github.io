1
00:00:00,552 --> 00:00:02,394
[SPEAKER_01]: So it looks like we are live.

2
00:00:02,514 --> 00:00:04,336
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say hello to everybody who's watching.

3
00:00:04,356 --> 00:00:14,086
[SPEAKER_01]: I see that Hannah is a little bit frozen, so I'm going to go ahead and switch her over.

4
00:00:14,106 --> 00:00:15,868
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, we've got her.

5
00:00:16,028 --> 00:00:16,689
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.

6
00:00:17,289 --> 00:00:22,095
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm Anna Callahan, and I have with me Hannah Friedman.

7
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:30,407
[SPEAKER_01]: who has been doing just amazing work with mutual aid Medford and Somerville.

8
00:00:30,547 --> 00:00:33,370
[SPEAKER_01]: So fantastic, really great.

9
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:45,242
[SPEAKER_01]: So Hannah, I would love to have you just say a little bit about who you are and how MAMAS, Mutual Aid Medford and Somerville started.

10
00:00:46,948 --> 00:00:47,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, thanks, Anna.

11
00:00:48,029 --> 00:00:48,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, everyone.

12
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:49,551
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Hannah.

13
00:00:49,651 --> 00:00:50,772
[SPEAKER_03]: I use she, her pronouns.

14
00:00:50,972 --> 00:00:53,254
[SPEAKER_03]: I live in Medford, right by Magoon Square.

15
00:00:53,274 --> 00:01:01,042
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I'm been in Medford for, I came here for college and stayed.

16
00:01:01,402 --> 00:01:09,450
[SPEAKER_03]: And mama started right when, about a week and a half ago, two weeks ago, when a lot of the coronavirus

17
00:01:11,624 --> 00:01:16,585
[SPEAKER_03]: precautions were really starting to become like a present reality for everyone.

18
00:01:16,966 --> 00:01:27,289
[SPEAKER_03]: And with two of my housemates and another friend who's local to Somerville, we started MAMAS, which stands for Mutual Aid Medford and Somerville.

19
00:01:27,929 --> 00:01:28,049
[SPEAKER_03]: And

20
00:01:29,413 --> 00:01:36,114
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically a collective and set of resources about how to set up a mutual aid network in your area.

21
00:01:36,194 --> 00:01:38,415
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there are a bunch of different parts.

22
00:01:38,435 --> 00:01:44,536
[SPEAKER_03]: There's ways where folks can provide offerings that they have that other community members can share in.

23
00:01:45,156 --> 00:01:51,777
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a place where people can write about needs that they have and other community members can get in touch with them to fill it.

24
00:01:52,257 --> 00:01:56,078
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there are neighborhood pods, which are basically like

25
00:01:56,541 --> 00:02:09,444
[SPEAKER_03]: folks that take on reaching out to their neighbors and spreading the word in like a certain geographic region and then kind of connecting all of their neighbors with the larger resource bank that we're building with Mamas.

26
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:11,825
[SPEAKER_03]: So things are still pretty new.

27
00:02:11,885 --> 00:02:22,248
[SPEAKER_03]: It's only been about two weeks and we are, you know, just like reflecting and trying to shift and build things out to really be the kind of network that we're going to need to weather this crisis.

28
00:02:23,973 --> 00:02:25,154
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.

29
00:02:25,174 --> 00:02:30,017
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to talk more about mamas in just a second.

30
00:02:31,658 --> 00:02:35,601
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought we might open up with a couple of public service announcements.

31
00:02:37,582 --> 00:02:40,404
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if you've had a chance to read these.

32
00:02:40,444 --> 00:02:46,989
[SPEAKER_01]: There have been some Medium posts that became very popular by a guy named Tomas Pueyo.

33
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,470
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure that I pronounced that correctly.

34
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:50,250
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

35
00:02:52,831 --> 00:03:01,075
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and by the way, if you're watching on YouTube, you can just write a question or a comment and then we can see those and we'll answer people as this goes on live.

36
00:03:03,196 --> 00:03:09,642
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the first Medium post that he made, it's called Coronavirus, Why You Must Act Now.

37
00:03:10,282 --> 00:03:20,070
[SPEAKER_01]: That one is really about how serious this is and the importance of social distancing or what I like to call physical distancing, right?

38
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:22,192
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to be physically distant from each other.

39
00:03:23,533 --> 00:03:27,597
[SPEAKER_01]: Keeping six feet of space, not touching things other people have touched, just the

40
00:03:28,237 --> 00:03:48,914
[SPEAKER_01]: the reality of how incredibly contagious coronavirus is and how important it is that we slow down, we like flatten the curve, as I say, we slow down the number of people who are infected because of the fear of overwhelming our hospitals.

41
00:03:51,336 --> 00:03:53,358
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if you have any thoughts about that.

42
00:03:56,832 --> 00:03:59,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to keep listening to, uh-oh.

43
00:04:01,814 --> 00:04:03,055
[SPEAKER_01]: You seem good, I can hear you.

44
00:04:03,115 --> 00:04:05,956
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so sorry, technical difficulties.

45
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:07,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Technical difficulties, so sorry.

46
00:04:07,496 --> 00:04:08,117
[SPEAKER_03]: That's okay.

47
00:04:08,417 --> 00:04:09,777
[SPEAKER_03]: We can see and hear you great.

48
00:04:11,098 --> 00:04:11,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

49
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that sounds good to me.

50
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:22,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Just trying to keep up with all of the really fast-moving new public health guidelines that are in place.

51
00:04:22,122 --> 00:04:22,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

52
00:04:24,353 --> 00:04:25,374
[SPEAKER_03]: we can to keep each other safe.

53
00:04:25,594 --> 00:04:25,895
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

54
00:04:26,355 --> 00:04:26,555
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

55
00:04:26,775 --> 00:04:44,449
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanted to kind of start this off in case there are people who don't really understand the magnitude of the crisis that we're in and why people are doing all these measures, like why all the schools have been shut down, why all the restaurants have been shut down, you know, why all of this stuff is happening.

56
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:49,952
[SPEAKER_01]: that it really is critical that we not overwhelm our hospitals, basically.

57
00:04:51,033 --> 00:05:01,958
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other one, and he did a second post after he got many millions of views on that first post, and basically it's talking about what does this look like?

58
00:05:01,998 --> 00:05:06,741
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we have to stay indoors, socially isolated from each other for six months or a year?

59
00:05:06,761 --> 00:05:12,063
[SPEAKER_01]: For people who are maybe aware of how bad it is and want to not be

60
00:05:16,067 --> 00:05:16,788
[SPEAKER_01]: need a ray of hope.

61
00:05:17,588 --> 00:05:33,620
[SPEAKER_01]: So the ray of hope is that already in some countries they have flattened the curve and so it's really a question of right now doing everything we can to reduce the number of people who get it at the same time.

62
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:43,227
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know there was a great video of a doctor talking about what's happening in Taiwan and in Taiwan you know they are

63
00:05:45,771 --> 00:05:47,952
[SPEAKER_01]: they are currently kind of going about their daily lives.

64
00:05:48,493 --> 00:05:50,574
[SPEAKER_01]: They have tons of tests.

65
00:05:50,594 --> 00:05:51,974
[SPEAKER_01]: They have testing for everyone.

66
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,316
[SPEAKER_01]: They have plenty of masks.

67
00:05:54,536 --> 00:05:55,636
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone wears masks.

68
00:05:56,477 --> 00:06:02,020
[SPEAKER_01]: As you enter public places like schools or shopping malls, they have little people who have like a little forehead temperature check

69
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:09,903
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you are quarantined, the government actually calls you at national health care.

70
00:06:09,943 --> 00:06:14,005
[SPEAKER_01]: So the national health care system calls you three times a day to ask you about your symptoms.

71
00:06:14,105 --> 00:06:17,766
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you need to go to the hospital, they arrange to have you delivered to the hospital.

72
00:06:18,827 --> 00:06:19,887
[SPEAKER_01]: And they pay people to stay home.

73
00:06:21,768 --> 00:06:27,090
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, there's a lot of hope there that we are not going to have to live like this forever.

74
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:35,533
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we can just, you know, be good for the next few weeks, we'll see.

75
00:06:35,553 --> 00:06:36,713
[SPEAKER_01]: Every country is different.

76
00:06:36,753 --> 00:06:37,513
[SPEAKER_01]: Every region is different.

77
00:06:37,553 --> 00:06:43,175
[SPEAKER_01]: But hopefully we can get it under control and have some hope for more normal lives soon.

78
00:06:50,852 --> 00:06:51,533
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, great.

79
00:06:51,793 --> 00:06:56,656
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I want to ask more questions about Mutually Medford and Somerville.

80
00:06:57,757 --> 00:06:58,777
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so exciting.

81
00:06:58,817 --> 00:07:02,260
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you guys have, you have a lot of email lists.

82
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,443
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you just talk about sort of what you have available to people and how people are communicating through Mamas?

83
00:07:08,284 --> 00:07:10,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so things are still in the works.

84
00:07:10,966 --> 00:07:14,308
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are launching new systems like almost every day, which is pretty cool.

85
00:07:14,966 --> 00:07:28,904
[SPEAKER_03]: But right now, the things that we have available for folks are to connect via the needs and offerings spreadsheets, which can be found on our website, mutualaidmamas.com.

86
00:07:29,745 --> 00:07:33,069
[SPEAKER_03]: And we also have a hotline that's available to folks.

87
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:36,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, I should know the number by heart, but I don't.

88
00:07:37,134 --> 00:07:37,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me pull it up.

89
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:45,845
[SPEAKER_03]: The hotline number, if anybody ever needs anything, wants to get in touch with anyone, connects up with some resources, you can call our hotline at 339-545-1315.

90
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:53,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, that's 339-545-1315.

91
00:07:53,131 --> 00:08:06,094
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have an awesome rotating list of volunteers that are answering those hotline calls every day and connecting people with the resources that they need.

92
00:08:06,674 --> 00:08:17,157
[SPEAKER_03]: So in addition to the hotline and the needs and offerings list, we also have a set of Google groups that folks can join if they're interested in taking on a more active organizing role in the network.

93
00:08:18,178 --> 00:08:30,140
[SPEAKER_03]: And we also have like a WhatsApp group chat of all of the Neighborhood Point people who can get together and just like share best practices and tips and ideas and support each other on that.

94
00:08:30,816 --> 00:08:40,040
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, if you sign up through the offerings form or otherwise give us your email, we will put you on our email list.

95
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,821
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've been sending out a couple of newsletters.

96
00:08:41,881 --> 00:08:50,544
[SPEAKER_03]: We just started this week and hope to continue sending out newsletters with like resource roundups and calls to action and other ways that folks can plug in.

97
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:54,606
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's awesome.

98
00:08:54,626 --> 00:08:58,788
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know that we don't wanna, you know,

99
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:04,982
[SPEAKER_01]: give it any personal information, but what are the needs that you're hearing, right?

100
00:09:05,302 --> 00:09:08,924
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm assuming, like, there are people who've lost their jobs.

101
00:09:10,265 --> 00:09:15,667
[SPEAKER_01]: There are people, there are, you know, college students who have been kicked out of the dorms.

102
00:09:16,947 --> 00:09:22,890
[SPEAKER_01]: So tell me what are some of the things that you're hearing from people in their needs?

103
00:09:26,572 --> 00:09:29,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it really runs the gamut.

104
00:09:29,533 --> 00:09:31,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Folks are in all kinds of different situations.

105
00:09:32,914 --> 00:09:42,058
[SPEAKER_03]: And like you lifted up, there's a lot of college students that were needing, especially right when Tufts was closing, some rapid response support.

106
00:09:42,585 --> 00:09:43,726
[SPEAKER_03]: and some housing support.

107
00:09:44,807 --> 00:10:01,639
[SPEAKER_03]: But we've also just had folks who are either immunocompromised and self-quarantining or folks who might have been exposed and are self-quarantining who need support in getting groceries from the grocery store and picking up their prescriptions.

108
00:10:02,825 --> 00:10:04,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Running errands.

109
00:10:04,726 --> 00:10:12,910
[SPEAKER_03]: We are connected with some different local nonprofits to help run deliveries back and forth.

110
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:20,555
[SPEAKER_03]: We are turning some of the little free libraries on the corners into micro food pantries, which is a pretty cool idea.

111
00:10:20,975 --> 00:10:25,857
[SPEAKER_03]: Taking the books out for now and putting some cans and canned food in.

112
00:10:27,577 --> 00:10:31,419
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, and it's also a lot of just like checking in on older folks.

113
00:10:31,479 --> 00:10:38,062
[SPEAKER_03]: We had someone who used to live here, who now moved out of state, whose mother still lives in Arlington.

114
00:10:38,322 --> 00:10:40,943
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, he called us and he was like, she is all alone.

115
00:10:40,963 --> 00:10:42,243
[SPEAKER_03]: She doesn't have any groceries.

116
00:10:42,784 --> 00:10:43,384
[SPEAKER_03]: How can you help?

117
00:10:43,784 --> 00:10:47,105
[SPEAKER_03]: And someone was going grocery shopping for her in like 15 minutes.

118
00:10:47,986 --> 00:10:50,547
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, stuff like that.

119
00:10:50,587 --> 00:10:52,828
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a pretty funny and really sweet

120
00:10:53,693 --> 00:10:55,095
[SPEAKER_03]: example right on St.

121
00:10:55,115 --> 00:11:14,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Patrick's Day of an older woman who was really disappointed to be missing out on her annual community corned beef dinner and like posted about it on the needs group and somebody responded and went to the grocery store and bought the ingredients and cooked her a corned beef dinner and delivered.

122
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Very Boston.

123
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:18,781
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.

124
00:11:19,982 --> 00:11:21,622
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to go ahead and take this opportunity.

125
00:11:21,642 --> 00:11:33,365
[SPEAKER_01]: There was someone who posted a need, and for the show we kind of reached out to a few people, and she said she's very happy to have her email that she had sent read on the show.

126
00:11:33,745 --> 00:11:36,426
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just going to read the very opening.

127
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:37,126
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is...

128
00:11:39,627 --> 00:11:49,738
[SPEAKER_01]: So my name is Ivy Ryan and I am a Somerville based actor and teaching artist and I just lost three quarters of my income and I'm scrambling to make it through March and April.

129
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:58,939
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there are all sorts of needs that people are posting.

130
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:09,844
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really amazing to sort of see what you're talking about, that there are people posting what's going on in their lives, and then there are all sorts of people who are offering to help.

131
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:19,748
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's very exciting and really what every community needs, what our community needs, what every community needs.

132
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:21,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

133
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:23,964
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, totally.

134
00:12:25,505 --> 00:12:36,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I do just want to speak also, though, to the role that, like, governments could be playing that would certainly make mutual aid work a lot easier.

135
00:12:36,995 --> 00:12:49,705
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I feel pretty nervous for April 1st to roll around and everybody's rent to be due, because we are receiving a lot of donations, but it is not going to be enough to cover all of the needs

136
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:53,941
[SPEAKER_03]: that folks are gonna have with bills and rent due April 1st.

137
00:12:54,601 --> 00:13:08,124
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do think that there are some actions, groups like City Life Vida Urbana that are based in Boston have been calling for rent freezes, a moratorium on evictions, foreclosures, mortgage payments.

138
00:13:09,024 --> 00:13:18,346
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are like real material choices that our state politicians could be making to make this crisis a little easier for everyone to weather.

139
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:24,428
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, you know, so thanks for that great segue because I was gonna, I was gonna run by you.

140
00:13:24,848 --> 00:13:31,091
[SPEAKER_01]: So Ben, you and Kemp and City Councilor was going to be here tonight and then you know how everything is changing like every five minutes.

141
00:13:31,151 --> 00:13:33,672
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like in the last week we've been through like a month.

142
00:13:35,113 --> 00:13:44,138
[SPEAKER_01]: Things are changing so quickly every day, so he's not able to make it tonight, but he sent over some of the things that he and J.T.

143
00:13:44,258 --> 00:13:48,400
[SPEAKER_01]: Scott, two Somerville City Councilors, have requested.

144
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:56,645
[SPEAKER_01]: They did a resolution for things that they say the state and national government should do, and I'll just read a few of these off, and I'd love to get your sense about them.

145
00:13:58,286 --> 00:14:08,277
[SPEAKER_01]: For workers in small business, including universal paid family and medical leave for all, unexpanded unemployment insurance for all workers, including self-employed, hourly, and gig workers.

146
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:18,068
[SPEAKER_01]: Financial assistance, including regular direct cash payments to all people without means testing for the duration of the crisis.

147
00:14:18,835 --> 00:14:27,758
[SPEAKER_01]: a public ownership stake of any large corporation receiving a federal bailout, and a prohibition on stock buybacks for any large corporation receiving a bailout.

148
00:14:29,792 --> 00:14:35,634
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know stock buybacks are this thing that's confusing, not a lot of people understand it.

149
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:37,635
[SPEAKER_01]: They were illegal until 1982.

150
00:14:38,155 --> 00:14:49,439
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is very recently that corporations have been allowed to sort of buy up all of their own stock, which increases the price of their stock, which makes all their shareholders richer, and does nothing for the company except put it in deeper debt.

151
00:14:50,379 --> 00:14:52,920
[SPEAKER_01]: So any thoughts on those before I go on to the next two?

152
00:14:55,957 --> 00:14:56,478
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep going.

153
00:14:56,498 --> 00:14:57,259
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep going.

154
00:14:58,761 --> 00:14:59,582
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.

155
00:15:00,223 --> 00:15:09,775
[SPEAKER_01]: Voting rights, including immediate implementation of vote-by-mail policies in all states and territories in order to assure that our democracy functions during this crisis.

156
00:15:12,604 --> 00:15:25,230
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fourth one is incarcerated people, including taking all steps to avoid COVID-19 infection among incarcerated people, such as releasing all people currently held in pretrial detention.

157
00:15:25,871 --> 00:15:29,873
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of those are people who just don't have the money to pay for cash bail.

158
00:15:30,073 --> 00:15:30,573
[SPEAKER_01]: So sad.

159
00:15:33,274 --> 00:15:37,917
[SPEAKER_01]: Prohibition on detaining people for greater than 48 hours without a court order.

160
00:15:40,528 --> 00:15:47,279
[SPEAKER_01]: without a court order finding a threat to public safety, and immediate clemency and release granted for incarcerated people who do not pose a threat to public safety.

161
00:15:49,642 --> 00:15:49,983
[SPEAKER_01]: Your thoughts?

162
00:15:53,461 --> 00:15:56,404
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean those all sound very important.

163
00:15:57,505 --> 00:16:06,915
[SPEAKER_03]: I hesitate a little to weigh in on your questions about like social distancing, public health policies, like state policies, because I am not an epidemiologist.

164
00:16:06,975 --> 00:16:08,897
[SPEAKER_03]: I am not a politician.

165
00:16:08,957 --> 00:16:09,998
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not write policy.

166
00:16:10,018 --> 00:16:11,640
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just like a regular

167
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:15,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Medford residents, like trying to keep things organized.

168
00:16:15,862 --> 00:16:21,185
[SPEAKER_03]: But from what I know about Ben and JT, those sound awesome.

169
00:16:21,245 --> 00:16:25,167
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm really grateful to have their progressive leadership in this moment.

170
00:16:25,227 --> 00:16:29,229
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that all sounds exactly like what is needed.

171
00:16:29,269 --> 00:16:31,871
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel really excited and blessed to follow their lead.

172
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:32,980
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.

173
00:16:33,761 --> 00:16:44,707
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say, I think we're going to have a criminal justice person on next week to talk about what's happening inside of jails where, you know, there literally isn't soap.

174
00:16:45,648 --> 00:16:48,570
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like people are forced to like eat at the same table.

175
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:49,790
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's just...

176
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:52,093
[SPEAKER_01]: terrifying, terrifying.

177
00:16:52,113 --> 00:16:58,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, on top of like the existing like human rights abuses that are already happening.

178
00:16:58,743 --> 00:16:59,925
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly, exactly.

179
00:16:59,965 --> 00:17:02,730
[SPEAKER_01]: And the number of people who are in jail for like marijuana.

180
00:17:04,467 --> 00:17:06,290
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of crimes, which is not a crime.

181
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:08,993
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like so crazy, so crazy.

182
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:12,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I appreciate you bringing all this up.

183
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:14,000
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

184
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:21,270
[SPEAKER_01]: Any final words before we go on to invite our local doctor in to chat with us?

185
00:17:23,617 --> 00:17:24,518
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

186
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:28,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Just that everyone in Medford and Somerville is welcome to get involved.

187
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:36,847
[SPEAKER_03]: If you are living in like a neighboring town, we can hook you up with other mutual aid networks that are popping off all across the state and the country.

193
00:18:00,597 --> 00:18:01,217
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Anna.

194
00:18:01,257 --> 00:18:05,219
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for all the incredible, incredible work that you guys have done.

195
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:05,859
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing.

196
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:08,420
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

197
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:08,740
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

198
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:09,700
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see you soon.

199
00:18:13,344 --> 00:18:19,109
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.

200
00:18:19,129 --> 00:18:23,974
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am now going to invite in a doctor whose name is Mvanwi Callahan.

201
00:18:24,134 --> 00:18:25,896
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, it is not an accident.

202
00:18:25,936 --> 00:18:28,218
[SPEAKER_01]: She is my sister.

203
00:18:28,238 --> 00:18:30,540
[SPEAKER_01]: And here she is.

204
00:18:31,281 --> 00:18:32,782
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me switch over the name.

205
00:18:32,802 --> 00:18:34,243
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the first time I've done this.

206
00:18:34,684 --> 00:18:35,625
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.

207
00:18:37,146 --> 00:18:37,927
[SPEAKER_01]: Mvanwi, hello.

208
00:18:39,511 --> 00:18:40,071
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi there.

209
00:18:40,091 --> 00:18:43,574
[SPEAKER_01]: I appear to, unfortunately, you are frozen at the moment.

210
00:18:43,594 --> 00:18:46,076
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me just see if I can.

211
00:18:46,596 --> 00:18:47,817
[SPEAKER_01]: You're frozen in Skype.

212
00:18:48,137 --> 00:18:48,698
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, dear.

213
00:18:48,718 --> 00:18:51,119
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no.

214
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,642
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got your photo, but we cannot see you in Skype.

215
00:18:55,722 --> 00:18:59,465
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me, do you mind if I just call you back?

216
00:18:59,485 --> 00:19:00,526
[SPEAKER_01]: That's absolutely fine.

217
00:19:00,546 --> 00:19:01,026
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.

218
00:19:01,146 --> 00:19:01,787
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be right here.

219
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:02,407
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me do that.

220
00:19:04,188 --> 00:19:06,010
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no.

221
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:06,470
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

222
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:08,051
[SPEAKER_01]: I have lost both of them.

223
00:19:08,151 --> 00:19:08,732
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do,

224
00:19:09,906 --> 00:19:12,727
[SPEAKER_01]: A quick dial in.

225
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:23,790
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

226
00:19:27,271 --> 00:19:30,792
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, hey, it's Daphne Boland.

227
00:19:30,852 --> 00:19:31,552
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.

228
00:19:31,572 --> 00:19:33,052
[SPEAKER_01]: Hang on one second.

229
00:19:33,532 --> 00:19:35,573
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to see if I can get my sister in here.

230
00:19:36,512 --> 00:19:38,833
[SPEAKER_01]: Daphne is going to be on with us in just a minute.

231
00:19:39,174 --> 00:19:39,754
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi there.

232
00:19:39,774 --> 00:19:40,955
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully this is working.

233
00:19:41,495 --> 00:19:41,795
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

234
00:19:42,396 --> 00:19:42,916
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me one second.

235
00:19:42,976 --> 00:19:44,277
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to switch over the camera.

236
00:19:44,297 --> 00:19:45,157
[SPEAKER_01]: That looks perfect.

237
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:48,299
[SPEAKER_01]: One second here.

238
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:50,841
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

239
00:19:50,881 --> 00:19:51,201
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.

240
00:19:52,682 --> 00:19:53,082
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.

241
00:19:54,403 --> 00:19:54,943
[SPEAKER_01]: Great to see you.

242
00:19:55,964 --> 00:20:02,468
[SPEAKER_01]: So first, if you don't mind just introducing yourself for the audience.

243
00:20:03,678 --> 00:20:04,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, absolutely.

244
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:06,260
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Madonna Callahan.

245
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,721
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually practice right here in Medford Center.

246
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:18,327
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a primary care internist and I've been working in Medford for about four years and in Somerville, I was a Somerville and just living there for about 15 years.

247
00:20:19,647 --> 00:20:19,867
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

248
00:20:20,328 --> 00:20:20,868
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.

249
00:20:22,322 --> 00:20:36,629
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, can you, first of all, I'm gonna interrupt to say there was a question, I'm just now looking at the comments, so if you're making a comment, said the guest audio is echoing, hopefully we just, hopefully it's not echoing anymore.

250
00:20:36,649 --> 00:20:39,871
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a thumbs up, that looks like that's right.

251
00:20:40,811 --> 00:20:43,112
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone asks, hey everyone, what's for dinner?

252
00:20:44,813 --> 00:20:47,455
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's always good to have fun on these shows.

253
00:20:48,856 --> 00:20:50,657
[SPEAKER_01]: And someone asked, how many people are involved in mamas?

254
00:20:51,138 --> 00:20:52,839
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I meant to ask that question.

255
00:20:52,879 --> 00:20:53,840
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry that I didn't.

256
00:20:55,341 --> 00:20:57,642
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get, well, next time we'll get some updates on that.

257
00:20:57,922 --> 00:20:59,303
[SPEAKER_01]: So move on.

258
00:20:59,724 --> 00:21:03,006
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to ask you just a general question.

259
00:21:03,026 --> 00:21:09,791
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what is it like to be a doctor here in Medford during this craziness?

260
00:21:11,417 --> 00:21:13,918
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to say it's not like anything I've ever seen before.

261
00:21:14,118 --> 00:21:16,139
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think everyone could say that.

262
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,480
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really unprecedented.

263
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:24,703
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think for us, as it has been for people in any profession, it's been different every single day.

264
00:21:25,123 --> 00:21:36,548
[SPEAKER_02]: So we actually have been having meetings every day, sometimes multiple times a day, as the guidelines have changed, as the testing has become available, as the epidemic is expanding.

265
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:40,130
[SPEAKER_02]: And so just trying to keep up with the latest recommendations,

266
00:21:40,573 --> 00:21:45,456
[SPEAKER_02]: has been one of the difficulties as we go along.

267
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:49,519
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you give an example of a recommendation that was yesterday or the other day?

268
00:21:49,539 --> 00:21:53,362
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the big difficulties that we're still struggling with is the lack of enough tests.

269
00:21:53,762 --> 00:21:58,485
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will just frankly say there are not as many tests as I would like to have for coronavirus.

270
00:21:59,566 --> 00:22:00,627
[SPEAKER_02]: At the very beginning,

271
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:10,572
[SPEAKER_02]: only, and this was now two weeks ago, only people who had international travel or knew they were exposed to someone who was positive for coronavirus could even get a test.

272
00:22:11,132 --> 00:22:19,734
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously we knew there were already cases in Washington and California, you know, all over, and we just didn't know who was exposed and who wasn't.

273
00:22:20,234 --> 00:22:24,815
[SPEAKER_02]: So about 10 days ago, they lifted those restrictions and we were able to test domestic cases.

274
00:22:25,436 --> 00:22:27,076
[SPEAKER_02]: But because there are so few tests,

275
00:22:27,837 --> 00:22:31,260
[SPEAKER_02]: there are not nearly enough tests to test even the sick patients.

276
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:34,623
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know that there's some asymptomatic people as well.

277
00:22:35,704 --> 00:22:39,587
[SPEAKER_02]: We're really focusing on those that are high risk for transmitting to others.

278
00:22:39,687 --> 00:22:49,435
[SPEAKER_02]: So people who live in nursing homes, EMTs, firefighters, grocery store workers, who if we don't know if they have coronavirus or not could potentially spread it to dozens of other people.

279
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:56,000
[SPEAKER_02]: So I, every day I have questions from patients and I would love to test everyone

280
00:22:56,582 --> 00:22:59,503
[SPEAKER_02]: that is sick and that I think could very well have coronavirus.

281
00:22:59,984 --> 00:23:02,725
[SPEAKER_02]: And currently we just do not have enough testing in the state.

282
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:03,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

283
00:23:04,265 --> 00:23:06,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Any ideas of when that's going to change?

284
00:23:07,267 --> 00:23:09,228
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do have some good news.

285
00:23:09,288 --> 00:23:11,149
[SPEAKER_02]: And once again, this is changing every day.

286
00:23:11,269 --> 00:23:21,453
[SPEAKER_02]: So on Monday, the Broad Institute reported that they actually developed a rapid test that would take about an hour or possibly even less.

287
00:23:22,073 --> 00:23:23,134
[SPEAKER_02]: That has not been

288
00:23:23,898 --> 00:23:27,541
[SPEAKER_02]: in production and really widely distributed, but I think it should be coming soon.

289
00:23:28,081 --> 00:23:37,509
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is some news, but I still feel that right now we have a test that takes three, four, five days to come back, sometimes even more.

290
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:47,277
[SPEAKER_02]: And people are sheltering in place, not just sheltering, they're quarantining, their family's quarantining, their friends are quarantining, and it has a huge effect.

291
00:23:48,762 --> 00:23:49,102
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

292
00:23:49,863 --> 00:23:54,045
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we only had the testing, then people could get tested and they wouldn't have to.

293
00:23:55,065 --> 00:23:55,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

294
00:23:55,645 --> 00:23:58,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we'd be able to have the people who need to be quarantined stay home.

295
00:23:59,347 --> 00:24:01,568
[SPEAKER_02]: And the people who can go back to work, go back to work.

296
00:24:02,369 --> 00:24:04,730
[SPEAKER_02]: That's been affecting our providers as well.

297
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:08,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Because right now, our biggest effort is to do no harm.

298
00:24:08,932 --> 00:24:18,377
[SPEAKER_02]: So any provider that walks in and has a sniffle, I mean, we really have to take them out until we get them tested so that we know that we're not spreading it to our patients.

299
00:24:19,053 --> 00:24:31,776
[SPEAKER_02]: And so one of the issues we've had is that we have multiple providers who are quarantined, and they're not able to see patients, which means that limited number of providers has to see everyone else.

300
00:24:32,436 --> 00:24:36,117
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

301
00:24:37,257 --> 00:24:46,879
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk a little bit about other ways that clinics that are still open are protecting both the clinicians and the patients?

302
00:24:47,975 --> 00:24:48,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

303
00:24:48,815 --> 00:24:54,277
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the things that we've established, we actually have six centers across the state that do drive-through testing.

304
00:24:54,717 --> 00:25:04,380
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is really key because when we have someone that we think may have coronavirus, we can do the testing, we can get that information to them, and they never walk in the building.

305
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:12,082
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that this is passed through droplets, but also if droplets fall on a surface, a table or a doorknob, it can get passed from person to person.

306
00:25:12,602 --> 00:25:15,083
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're really doing our best to limit the exposure

307
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:18,629
[SPEAKER_02]: of people who might have coronavirus to people who don't.

308
00:25:19,229 --> 00:25:26,092
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing that we've done is we've really switched over a ton of visits to telephone or video visits.

309
00:25:26,793 --> 00:25:41,400
[SPEAKER_02]: So, for example, people who might have had their diabetes visit with their doctor, now they will talk about their blood sugars over the phone, they'll talk about any side effects, but we may not bring them in because we know that diabetics, for example, are at higher risk of complications.

310
00:25:42,156 --> 00:25:46,359
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other piece is that we're actually canceling a lot of elective visits.

311
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:52,884
[SPEAKER_02]: I say elective, what I mean is kind of preventive care, what usually we want to do to keep people healthy.

312
00:25:53,504 --> 00:25:58,408
[SPEAKER_02]: But those physicals, regular check-ins, we're just postponing for now.

313
00:25:59,369 --> 00:26:01,030
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that's true at other hospitals too.

314
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:10,997
[SPEAKER_02]: They're canceling all of the surgeries that don't have to be done right now, knowing that bringing people into the center could help contribute to spread,

315
00:26:11,817 --> 00:26:15,398
[SPEAKER_02]: and that we're going to need that capacity as the numbers keep skyrocketing.

316
00:26:16,179 --> 00:26:16,979
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

317
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:25,702
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one thing I also wanted to ask you about, just because I know we've talked about a little bit, is there's some sort of rotation schedule?

318
00:26:25,822 --> 00:26:33,685
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's specific places where the COVID patients are being sent, and other places where they're not coming in, and then there's a rotation schedule.

319
00:26:33,705 --> 00:26:34,705
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk a little bit about that?

320
00:26:35,465 --> 00:26:38,226
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example, we have those six sites that do the drive-through testing.

321
00:26:41,054 --> 00:26:52,937
[SPEAKER_02]: all the patients that normally would be spread across multiple practices, anyone that we even think could have coronavirus goes to those testing centers, which allows the other testing centers to see other patients that need to be seen.

322
00:26:53,437 --> 00:27:05,339
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, people still sprain their ankle, they still get appendicitis, they still need to come in from time to time, and we just want to protect those patients who have the usual things from getting coronavirus.

323
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:09,540
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and is there a rotation of

324
00:27:11,371 --> 00:27:21,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I mean, for example, basically, we're trying to let every doctor know that we just are going to be as flexible as possible.

325
00:27:21,614 --> 00:27:28,296
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to be working at one of the coronavirus sites where we have a rotation of people who can.

326
00:27:28,336 --> 00:27:34,257
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, some people obviously have medical reasons why they really shouldn't be in those sites.

327
00:27:34,797 --> 00:27:40,719
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're trying to find physicians that can do that and rotate them through.

328
00:27:41,967 --> 00:27:53,291
[SPEAKER_02]: both for relief of the people who are seeing all the coronavirus patients and also just because we know with quarantining with the possibility of getting sick we're going to need extra providers.

329
00:27:54,451 --> 00:28:07,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Healthcare workers are really at very high risk of getting this and we know that and we're willing to do that and be there for people but at the same time we're going to need those second ranks and those third ranks to come in

330
00:28:07,763 --> 00:28:10,284
[SPEAKER_02]: when those providers are out for a couple of weeks.

331
00:28:10,604 --> 00:28:20,909
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really incredible the sort of organization that is happening between these different hospitals and different, you know, different sort of corporate entities, right?

332
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:25,612
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's, you know, various different organizations that own different clinics.

333
00:28:25,712 --> 00:28:29,533
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's really amazing to see that all this coordination happening.

334
00:28:30,694 --> 00:28:36,757
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that some of the hospitals are already outreaching to other centers, community health centers, our centers,

335
00:28:37,197 --> 00:28:43,441
[SPEAKER_02]: to see if there are physicians that could work in the hospitals when that need comes to pass.

336
00:28:44,042 --> 00:28:49,646
[SPEAKER_02]: And as much as that may feel like disaster preparedness, it's exactly what we're doing.

337
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:50,807
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanna be prepared.

338
00:28:50,827 --> 00:28:52,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully it doesn't get to that point.

339
00:28:52,868 --> 00:28:55,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully everyone's work with staying at home means we've really flattened the curve.

340
00:28:56,631 --> 00:29:00,353
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we need to, we wanna make sure that we know who we can call in.

341
00:29:01,134 --> 00:29:03,916
[SPEAKER_02]: And right now, just to talk a little bit about the numbers,

342
00:29:04,578 --> 00:29:06,899
[SPEAKER_02]: We had over 700 cases yesterday.

343
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,460
[SPEAKER_02]: We're at over 1,800 today.

344
00:29:08,901 --> 00:29:11,202
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're really on that steep end of the curve.

345
00:29:12,163 --> 00:29:16,545
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't know exactly where this is going to flatten out, but it's definitely not there yet.

346
00:29:17,186 --> 00:29:24,210
[SPEAKER_01]: And the idea of flattening the curve is that the action you take today will flatten the curve 10 days from now?

347
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:25,271
[SPEAKER_01]: Something like that?

348
00:29:25,611 --> 00:29:26,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

349
00:29:27,712 --> 00:29:35,677
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the key pieces is that if we don't exceed the hospital capacity, then everybody can get the care that they need.

350
00:29:36,217 --> 00:29:42,361
[SPEAKER_02]: The worst case scenario is what we've seen in Italy, where they're really making choices about who gets a ventilator and who doesn't.

351
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:44,742
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just do not want to be in that situation.

352
00:29:45,423 --> 00:29:48,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, we're very lucky in Boston that we have a lot of hospital resources.

353
00:29:49,325 --> 00:29:57,310
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we saw that in the Boston Marathon bombing, where there were a lot of victims, but we had the resources to really take care of everyone who was injured.

354
00:29:57,943 --> 00:30:05,585
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm hoping that we are able to pull through this because of all the resources that we have and the preparations that we're doing.

355
00:30:06,045 --> 00:30:06,185
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

356
00:30:06,545 --> 00:30:16,408
[SPEAKER_01]: And you were mentioning earlier today, I think that we have more hospitals and medical clinics per person than most places or?

357
00:30:16,808 --> 00:30:18,128
[SPEAKER_01]: Than most places.

358
00:30:18,428 --> 00:30:18,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

359
00:30:18,888 --> 00:30:20,209
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Boston is fairly unique.

360
00:30:20,229 --> 00:30:25,850
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a ton of teaching hospitals and just a lot of hospital systems.

361
00:30:26,518 --> 00:30:29,420
[SPEAKER_02]: And for this situation, that's actually a real blessing.

362
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:35,564
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're in a good position, but I do think that everyone is taking this very seriously.

363
00:30:36,484 --> 00:30:39,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Already hospitals are seeing a lot of coronavirus patients.

364
00:30:39,906 --> 00:30:43,809
[SPEAKER_02]: And once again, we don't want to get to that point where we don't have enough beds.

365
00:30:44,489 --> 00:30:44,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

366
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:53,455
[SPEAKER_01]: So all you out there, this person you're seeing on the screen is one of the people that you will save a big nightmare and headache and

367
00:30:53,871 --> 00:31:03,718
[SPEAKER_01]: staying up late and working too hard and maybe getting coronavirus if you stay home, keep your social distance, wash your hands.

368
00:31:03,798 --> 00:31:09,883
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you just say one little thing about why washing your hands is really effective, that that is effective and why it's effective?

369
00:31:11,064 --> 00:31:17,929
[SPEAKER_02]: So we think about droplets and people coughing and sneezing, but the truth is we all touch our face a hundred times a day or more.

370
00:31:18,489 --> 00:31:20,531
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the truth is that when you,

371
00:31:21,497 --> 00:31:25,300
[SPEAKER_02]: just scratch your nose, then you might have coronavirus on your hands.

372
00:31:25,881 --> 00:31:28,303
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you have to wash your hands regularly.

373
00:31:28,683 --> 00:31:37,030
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you go out, if you go grocery shopping, I just really encourage people to wash their hands after they get home to make sure that everything from when they were out is off.

374
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:42,174
[SPEAKER_01]: And the good thing about washing your hands is like the virus itself is encased in like a lipid.

375
00:31:42,194 --> 00:31:43,795
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

376
00:31:43,835 --> 00:31:44,276
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

377
00:31:44,296 --> 00:31:44,516
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

378
00:31:44,556 --> 00:31:49,300
[SPEAKER_02]: So it has a little, it has kind of a coating of fat around the outside.

379
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,741
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you break up that fat,

380
00:31:51,188 --> 00:31:52,229
[SPEAKER_02]: the virus can't survive.

381
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:56,273
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the truth is that just good old regular soap and water works.

382
00:31:57,694 --> 00:31:58,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Use it regularly.

383
00:31:58,455 --> 00:32:00,536
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need to make hand sanitizer.

384
00:32:00,597 --> 00:32:01,758
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just use regular soap.

385
00:32:02,198 --> 00:32:02,839
[SPEAKER_02]: It works just fine.

386
00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:03,940
[SPEAKER_01]: Wonderful.

387
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,161
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.

388
00:32:05,961 --> 00:32:07,743
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, of course, for the work that you're doing.

389
00:32:07,783 --> 00:32:12,187
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are the heroes of the day, the week, the month, the year, probably.

390
00:32:12,207 --> 00:32:14,889
[SPEAKER_01]: And thanks for being on.

391
00:32:16,003 --> 00:32:17,063
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, thank you.

392
00:32:17,263 --> 00:32:17,803
[SPEAKER_01]: Good luck out there.

393
00:32:18,104 --> 00:32:20,624
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, be safe.

394
00:32:21,744 --> 00:32:28,126
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so our next guest is Daphne Ballin.

395
00:32:28,946 --> 00:32:29,586
[SPEAKER_01]: Here she is.

396
00:32:29,606 --> 00:32:31,167
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Daphne, how are you?

397
00:32:31,187 --> 00:32:33,587
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, how are you?

398
00:32:33,607 --> 00:32:40,989
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good, and Daphne is one of our paraprofessional teachers in Somerville Public Schools.

399
00:32:42,394 --> 00:32:50,001
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you wanna give a little, I just gave the intro already, but do you wanna say anything more about sort of who you are and all that?

400
00:32:50,462 --> 00:32:53,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, again, my name is Daphne.

401
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:55,947
[SPEAKER_04]: I am a paraprofessional.

402
00:32:55,987 --> 00:33:01,712
[SPEAKER_04]: I work in the preschool, pre-K-8 style program.

403
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:03,874
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's about it.

404
00:33:03,954 --> 00:33:04,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

405
00:33:05,412 --> 00:33:07,733
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been in the education field for years.

406
00:33:07,833 --> 00:33:08,293
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, great.

407
00:33:09,453 --> 00:33:09,974
[SPEAKER_01]: You can tell.

408
00:33:12,795 --> 00:33:15,756
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really have two questions for you.

409
00:33:16,176 --> 00:33:20,597
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one is what it's like to be a teacher during the whole coronavirus craziness.

410
00:33:20,717 --> 00:33:25,219
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the second one is going to be about the paras and the current contract fight that you're in.

411
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:28,380
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you could talk first about what is it like?

412
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:31,281
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a teacher, and then all the schools are closed.

413
00:33:34,564 --> 00:33:35,405
[SPEAKER_04]: unprecedented.

414
00:33:35,725 --> 00:33:37,306
[SPEAKER_04]: It's completely different.

415
00:33:37,346 --> 00:33:41,409
[SPEAKER_04]: It's almost like your life has been flipped upside down.

416
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:56,599
[SPEAKER_04]: The thing about us teachers is that we, you know, as much as they say, leave your work at home, work at work, we take our work at home with us because these are vulnerable children.

417
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:59,541
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we care about

418
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:07,793
[SPEAKER_04]: what they've done, how they get, how their accomplishments go.

419
00:34:09,094 --> 00:34:10,894
[SPEAKER_04]: We care about their daily lives.

420
00:34:11,014 --> 00:34:13,316
[SPEAKER_04]: And you deal with different types of children.

421
00:34:13,936 --> 00:34:23,621
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have children that don't necessarily have, you don't necessarily have a concern for them in terms of their home and what they're dealing with.

422
00:34:24,061 --> 00:34:26,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you also have children that do have concerns.

423
00:34:28,819 --> 00:34:36,726
[SPEAKER_04]: You have the classroom every day, shifts and changes, and we always have to be prepared for that.

424
00:34:36,746 --> 00:34:48,856
[SPEAKER_04]: If something happens that day in the classroom, we kind of go home and try to process and try to figure out what can we do next and for the next day to kind of have a successful day for these children.

425
00:34:49,176 --> 00:34:57,363
[SPEAKER_04]: So we don't go to bed and forget about our problems or our daily issues.

426
00:34:58,233 --> 00:35:08,635
[SPEAKER_04]: And this has been very, very, very emotional to us because it's different.

427
00:35:08,655 --> 00:35:10,876
[SPEAKER_04]: And everything has shifted for us.

428
00:35:12,196 --> 00:35:20,518
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're not just concerned about what our lesson plans are or how these children are going to learn.

429
00:35:20,578 --> 00:35:26,179
[SPEAKER_04]: We're concerned about how they're feeling and how this change is affecting them.

430
00:35:26,818 --> 00:35:29,459
[SPEAKER_04]: and how that's going to affect them moving forward.

431
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:45,746
[SPEAKER_04]: And our biggest thing is to try to figure out, you know, communicating with these students, being specific to which students as a teacher that you have the most connection with and trying to figure out, can you help?

432
00:35:46,327 --> 00:35:49,528
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a huge need for translation.

433
00:35:50,568 --> 00:35:54,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Many of parents speak different languages and they have no idea what's going on.

434
00:35:55,267 --> 00:35:56,268
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't understand it.

435
00:35:56,288 --> 00:36:03,115
[SPEAKER_04]: This whole, you know, having the virtual learning thing is difficult.

436
00:36:03,775 --> 00:36:04,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Parents have to go to work.

437
00:36:05,077 --> 00:36:06,518
[SPEAKER_04]: There are parents that have to go to work.

438
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,181
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what happens to these children?

439
00:36:09,201 --> 00:36:11,563
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's been hard.

440
00:36:13,005 --> 00:36:13,766
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a process.

441
00:36:15,387 --> 00:36:16,669
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're dealing with it.

442
00:36:16,729 --> 00:36:17,910
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going head first.

443
00:36:18,795 --> 00:36:20,616
[SPEAKER_04]: with it, but it is different.

444
00:36:20,996 --> 00:36:21,556
[SPEAKER_04]: It is different.

445
00:36:21,816 --> 00:36:22,156
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

446
00:36:22,537 --> 00:36:29,780
[SPEAKER_01]: And what is your, is, are you, so are you doing things during the day through the public school system that they have?

447
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:30,920
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you doing training?

448
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:35,002
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you doing, you know, are you interacting within Zoom calls with the kids?

449
00:36:35,022 --> 00:36:37,663
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what's, what's, what's happening day to day?

450
00:36:38,483 --> 00:36:39,103
[SPEAKER_04]: We do.

451
00:36:39,263 --> 00:36:45,906
[SPEAKER_04]: So my class in particular, we do once a week where we meet with the children on Zoom.

452
00:36:46,723 --> 00:36:52,745
[SPEAKER_04]: There are other classes depending upon the age and what's best for the individual teachers.

453
00:36:53,766 --> 00:36:56,567
[SPEAKER_04]: They may have Zoom every day.

454
00:36:56,587 --> 00:37:01,128
[SPEAKER_04]: There are school classes that have a Zoom meeting every day.

455
00:37:01,649 --> 00:37:04,570
[SPEAKER_04]: There are others that have twice a day or things of that sort.

456
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:13,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Within our classrooms, not in our classrooms, within our actual school, we have two

457
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:31,419
[SPEAKER_04]: conference meetings a week, just to keep connected with each other and bounce off ideas as to what would work best in certain situations, and just try to figure out how do we keep ourselves afloat during these times.

458
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:43,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, we still have the pantries, we're giving out diapers and Chromebooks to students in need.

459
00:37:44,445 --> 00:37:56,612
[SPEAKER_04]: We're still working behind the scenes and trying to do our best to just provide for these children and help these families as they go through this time.

460
00:37:56,652 --> 00:38:01,435
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we have a comment from one of the viewers that says, thanks, Daphne.

461
00:38:01,455 --> 00:38:08,759
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Welcome Project is offering translation services for free to help communicate resources, et cetera.

462
00:38:08,779 --> 00:38:10,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

463
00:38:12,085 --> 00:38:17,110
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something that I could definitely go ahead and convey that message to anyone.

464
00:38:20,741 --> 00:38:21,961
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, good.

465
00:38:22,361 --> 00:38:28,403
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I would love to hear from you a little bit more about the paras.

466
00:38:28,863 --> 00:38:33,944
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you guys are in a contract fight with the city of Somerville for a living wage.

467
00:38:34,304 --> 00:38:41,766
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can give us a brief sort of rundown of what it is and then sort of what's the state of it now.

468
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:43,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

469
00:38:44,687 --> 00:38:48,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, one of our biggest fights is that paraprofessionals

470
00:38:51,883 --> 00:39:01,208
[SPEAKER_04]: without whether they have a degree, whether they don't have a degree, whether they have experience, to not make more than $25,000 a year.

471
00:39:01,348 --> 00:39:03,349
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's so insane.

472
00:39:03,369 --> 00:39:05,410
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, that's like so horrible.

473
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:07,731
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like I can't even believe it.

474
00:39:08,411 --> 00:39:09,112
[SPEAKER_04]: It's insane.

475
00:39:09,272 --> 00:39:19,497
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of paraprofessional teachers are making $20,000 a year, forcing them to have to work two, three jobs.

476
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:25,109
[SPEAKER_04]: to be able to make ends meet.

477
00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:34,096
[SPEAKER_04]: All of the paraprofessionals have to wait every year at the end of the school year to know if they're going to have their job the next year.

478
00:39:34,116 --> 00:39:42,862
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is from someone that's brand new that's just been working a year to people that's been working 25, 30 years.

479
00:39:42,902 --> 00:39:46,305
[SPEAKER_04]: So our fight right now is to

480
00:39:50,565 --> 00:40:00,272
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of flip what's been wrong with this system and kind of start to get in for a change.

481
00:40:00,632 --> 00:40:02,834
[SPEAKER_04]: And this isn't going to happen overnight.

482
00:40:02,974 --> 00:40:08,477
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why we've come up with this plan where we're asking for $25,000, because $25,000 is nothing.

483
00:40:08,577 --> 00:40:09,458
[SPEAKER_04]: It really is too low.

484
00:40:09,558 --> 00:40:10,018
[SPEAKER_04]: It is too low.

485
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:10,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

486
00:40:10,399 --> 00:40:12,380
[SPEAKER_04]: But what will happen is, if we start there,

487
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:34,847
[SPEAKER_04]: then we could move on, move into something that is fair and just for these people that are working with the most vulnerable children, people in our world, in our city, in our district.

488
00:40:36,107 --> 00:40:48,693
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have been working really hard with the help of our union, of course, and so many community members that have just been standing

489
00:40:49,685 --> 00:40:51,526
[SPEAKER_04]: with us in this site.

490
00:40:52,386 --> 00:41:00,768
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to continue to call it a site because that's what it is, because we have been dealing with a lot of pushback.

491
00:41:01,708 --> 00:41:14,072
[SPEAKER_04]: And so here we are, we were in the, we were going to have our first negotiation meeting with members of the school committee.

492
00:41:15,192 --> 00:41:16,733
[SPEAKER_04]: And that happened after we,

493
00:41:20,105 --> 00:41:25,206
[SPEAKER_04]: came in as a school committee meeting, and they finally made a decision to meet with us.

494
00:41:26,307 --> 00:41:33,028
[SPEAKER_04]: But unfortunately, everything, coronavirus came in, and we weren't able to have that meeting.

495
00:41:33,108 --> 00:41:36,469
[SPEAKER_04]: It was canceled as schools were closed that day.

496
00:41:37,189 --> 00:41:41,770
[SPEAKER_04]: But we are planning to have a meeting next week sometime.

497
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:43,090
[SPEAKER_04]: The date has not been set.

498
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:44,510
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I can imagine.

499
00:41:48,017 --> 00:41:58,764
[SPEAKER_04]: We said next week, but that was before Governor Baker said that we have to have, school doesn't probably start until May 4th.

500
00:41:58,804 --> 00:42:00,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, that just happened today, right?

501
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:02,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, exactly.

502
00:42:02,667 --> 00:42:04,688
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just, you know, it's a lot.

503
00:42:04,728 --> 00:42:08,650
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot for a school committee and for our superintendent to deal with.

504
00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:13,474
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and their plan was to show up this time.

505
00:42:15,512 --> 00:42:16,093
[SPEAKER_04]: We will see.

506
00:42:16,273 --> 00:42:21,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully we can have a meeting next week, but if not, we continue to persevere.

507
00:42:22,216 --> 00:42:25,017
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll see what happens next.

508
00:42:26,358 --> 00:42:27,139
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

509
00:42:27,799 --> 00:42:28,339
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

510
00:42:28,499 --> 00:42:32,021
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to have the update on what's going on with that.

511
00:42:33,002 --> 00:42:35,403
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, of course.

512
00:42:35,583 --> 00:42:36,103
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

513
00:42:36,123 --> 00:42:40,225
[SPEAKER_01]: There's lots and lots of us who are on your side.

514
00:42:40,245 --> 00:42:42,567
[SPEAKER_01]: We appreciate that.

515
00:42:42,587 --> 00:42:43,107
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.

516
00:42:43,447 --> 00:42:45,829
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, great to talk to you.

517
00:42:45,949 --> 00:42:46,930
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any final thoughts?

518
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:50,093
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, if anybody has questions, we can always throw your questions up here.

519
00:42:50,113 --> 00:42:55,678
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just put them in the comments in the YouTube comments section.

520
00:42:56,358 --> 00:43:03,885
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, if you have any final thoughts you want to about just about how can we weather this?

521
00:43:03,945 --> 00:43:04,646
[SPEAKER_01]: How can parents

522
00:43:05,326 --> 00:43:08,107
[SPEAKER_01]: get through this time without child care.

523
00:43:08,787 --> 00:43:09,827
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we do that?

524
00:43:09,887 --> 00:43:12,208
[SPEAKER_04]: I need your help.

525
00:43:12,308 --> 00:43:13,788
[SPEAKER_04]: It's crazy.

526
00:43:14,328 --> 00:43:21,710
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, the biggest thing that they need right now is to feel as though they have a strong support system.

527
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:24,951
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know that we're going to have work for them.

528
00:43:25,031 --> 00:43:28,332
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to, you know, have ideas

529
00:43:30,958 --> 00:43:34,941
[SPEAKER_04]: as to how to make the structure of the day go well for you.

530
00:43:35,041 --> 00:43:49,809
[SPEAKER_04]: So try your best to fit in a structure that's going to work best for you and your home and your children or child because you don't want them to be overwhelmed.

531
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:51,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Let them have fun.

532
00:43:53,611 --> 00:43:57,373
[SPEAKER_04]: This is different for them and they miss their teachers.

533
00:43:57,594 --> 00:43:58,334
[SPEAKER_04]: They miss their

534
00:43:58,892 --> 00:44:00,592
[SPEAKER_04]: they miss their classmates.

535
00:44:00,812 --> 00:44:06,654
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I have my daughter with me and she tells me every single day, I miss school, I miss school.

536
00:44:06,714 --> 00:44:14,115
[SPEAKER_04]: We just had a Zoom meeting with her classmates and all of them were just so happy to see each other.

537
00:44:14,215 --> 00:44:18,876
[SPEAKER_04]: And they, you know, they just expressed how much they miss their class.

538
00:44:19,417 --> 00:44:20,357
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's different.

539
00:44:20,637 --> 00:44:25,878
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, think of those things and find things that they

540
00:44:26,448 --> 00:44:28,308
[SPEAKER_04]: enjoy, keep them entertained.

541
00:44:29,469 --> 00:44:31,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Entertainment is learning.

542
00:44:31,849 --> 00:44:40,150
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people think that, you know, a notebook and paper is part of the learning process, but there's so much more in daily interactions.

543
00:44:40,211 --> 00:44:49,552
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so much a child can get with a walk outside with you and the dog or just an adult in the conversation.

544
00:44:49,572 --> 00:44:51,633
[SPEAKER_04]: They are learning their sponges.

545
00:44:51,813 --> 00:44:53,793
[SPEAKER_04]: So take advantage of that.

546
00:44:55,182 --> 00:44:56,343
[SPEAKER_04]: And go from there.

547
00:44:56,483 --> 00:44:57,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

548
00:44:57,844 --> 00:45:00,706
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the way, being outdoors, A-OK, right?

549
00:45:00,766 --> 00:45:01,046
[SPEAKER_01]: A-OK.

550
00:45:01,846 --> 00:45:04,168
[SPEAKER_01]: A-OK.

551
00:45:04,228 --> 00:45:10,512
[SPEAKER_01]: This whole stay at home thing doesn't mean you can't go for a walk, go for a bike ride, go to a park, and stay six feet away from the other people.

552
00:45:10,992 --> 00:45:11,252
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

553
00:45:11,572 --> 00:45:11,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

554
00:45:12,012 --> 00:45:13,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

555
00:45:14,274 --> 00:45:17,196
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the best time for them because they need it.

556
00:45:17,456 --> 00:45:17,616
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

557
00:45:18,325 --> 00:45:18,705
[SPEAKER_01]: They do.

558
00:45:20,006 --> 00:45:20,387
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

559
00:45:20,487 --> 00:45:21,828
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.

560
00:45:22,148 --> 00:45:23,109
[SPEAKER_01]: Lovely to see you.

561
00:45:23,129 --> 00:45:23,649
[SPEAKER_01]: You're welcome.

562
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:24,970
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me.

563
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:25,771
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to see you too.

564
00:45:25,851 --> 00:45:26,512
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

565
00:45:26,532 --> 00:45:31,956
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll keep in touch and we'll keep people updated on how the Paris fight is going as well.

566
00:45:32,576 --> 00:45:33,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds good.

567
00:45:33,277 --> 00:45:35,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much for your help with this as well.

568
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:35,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good night.

569
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:36,980
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

570
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care of you too.

571
00:45:39,682 --> 00:45:41,544
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's it.

572
00:45:41,744 --> 00:45:45,827
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to go ahead and I will close up just with a reiteration that

573
00:45:47,559 --> 00:45:48,499
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one.

574
00:45:48,699 --> 00:45:51,560
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I have a lot of comments coming in.

575
00:45:52,681 --> 00:45:53,121
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

576
00:45:53,141 --> 00:45:59,623
[SPEAKER_01]: This is funny.

577
00:46:00,503 --> 00:46:03,264
[SPEAKER_01]: Living in a roommate situation can be tricky in easy times.

578
00:46:03,404 --> 00:46:07,425
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you convince roommates who won't agree to stop having guests over to agree?

579
00:46:09,946 --> 00:46:13,367
[SPEAKER_01]: Is having one guest in your personal quarters over okay?

580
00:46:15,665 --> 00:46:17,686
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, that's a very interesting question.

581
00:46:20,167 --> 00:46:22,508
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows who is the best person to answer that question?

582
00:46:22,668 --> 00:46:25,709
[SPEAKER_01]: I have lived with roommates for pretty much my entire adult life.

583
00:46:25,869 --> 00:46:30,510
[SPEAKER_01]: I live in co-ops and my family now lives in co-op and we love our housemates.

584
00:46:31,791 --> 00:46:36,292
[SPEAKER_01]: But we all sat down and we had the conversation about

585
00:46:37,048 --> 00:46:38,610
[SPEAKER_01]: Who is going to be invited over?

586
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:39,791
[SPEAKER_01]: Who is not going to be invited over?

587
00:46:41,213 --> 00:46:43,715
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is it okay for us to go out of the house?

588
00:46:48,131 --> 00:46:55,096
[SPEAKER_01]: real conversations about the sort of danger, the actual danger of what it could be like.

589
00:46:55,716 --> 00:47:06,023
[SPEAKER_01]: And not, like I know a lot of people, because it's more dangerous for people who are older, maybe younger folks are thinking like, oh well, even if I get it, it's like a flu, it's not a big deal.

590
00:47:06,063 --> 00:47:12,467
[SPEAKER_01]: Like even if you are okay, and even if it is like a regular flu for you, or even if you do not show symptoms,

591
00:47:14,768 --> 00:47:26,297
[SPEAKER_01]: So the reason this thing, you know, my sister who was just on was saying that there were 700 and something cases yesterday in Massachusetts and like 1,700 cases today.

592
00:47:26,318 --> 00:47:30,581
[SPEAKER_01]: So more than doubled the number of cases that we saw come in.

593
00:47:31,081 --> 00:47:38,567
[SPEAKER_01]: That's because you transmit the disease to anyone that you interact with before you even have any symptoms at all, before you know that you have it.

594
00:47:39,688 --> 00:47:49,719
[SPEAKER_01]: For other people, it is really important that you guys have that conversation and talk about like, hey, you know, who is going to come over?

595
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:53,182
[SPEAKER_01]: And where are those people going?

596
00:47:53,202 --> 00:47:53,983
[SPEAKER_01]: And what are those people doing?

597
00:47:54,003 --> 00:47:56,426
[SPEAKER_01]: And washing your hands and all those things.

598
00:47:58,626 --> 00:48:01,027
[SPEAKER_01]: I do feel for you.

599
00:48:01,948 --> 00:48:04,849
[SPEAKER_01]: Having roommates can be a big blessing, makes you less lonely.

600
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:10,793
[SPEAKER_01]: But it also, you know, these things to discuss and agree upon are pretty important.

601
00:48:10,833 --> 00:48:13,054
[SPEAKER_01]: So good luck with that discussion.

602
00:48:14,074 --> 00:48:22,639
[SPEAKER_01]: And oh, and we have a comment from someone saying, I would have a conversation with your roommates about not having guests over.

603
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:29,280
[SPEAKER_01]: The more closed loop, you could have the better chance of not spreading, less interaction, less spreading.

604
00:48:29,801 --> 00:48:32,182
[SPEAKER_01]: So great.

605
00:48:32,722 --> 00:48:37,204
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally, I will put, I don't know how to do it right now.

606
00:48:37,244 --> 00:48:46,107
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still new to this thing of broadcasting at the same time as having other people, other speakers on, so using some new software.

607
00:48:46,427 --> 00:48:52,430
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm going to put some links to the Tomas Pueyo articles, the Medium articles,

608
00:48:56,060 --> 00:49:01,142
[SPEAKER_01]: about why you must act now, so the importance that might be helpful with the roommate discussion.

609
00:49:01,882 --> 00:49:09,583
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the hammer and the dance, which is a lovely, a really good article that gives you hope that we're not going to be here social distancing forever.

610
00:49:09,603 --> 00:49:20,026
[SPEAKER_01]: I also have someone commenting, saying that if it's multiple roommates and having a group conversation and getting everyone on the same page is really important.

611
00:49:20,526 --> 00:49:21,886
[SPEAKER_01]: And I totally agree with that.

612
00:49:23,217 --> 00:49:23,978
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, everyone.

613
00:49:24,418 --> 00:49:25,539
[SPEAKER_01]: It has been great.

614
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:30,384
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say one of the big goals of doing this, we're going to try and do it every week with different folks.

615
00:49:30,945 --> 00:49:36,050
[SPEAKER_01]: We have city councilors from several and Medford that we'll have on the show, and lots of other people.

616
00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:43,238
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the big goals is to hear stories of what's happening in our community.

617
00:49:43,698 --> 00:49:48,859
[SPEAKER_01]: and to have others in our community be aware of what's happening to the sort of more vulnerable people.

618
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:53,761
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know that there are folks here who have lost their housing because they were at Tufts.

619
00:49:53,821 --> 00:49:59,082
[SPEAKER_01]: We know there are folks here who have lost their jobs.

620
00:50:00,262 --> 00:50:06,084
[SPEAKER_01]: And so finding ways that we can support each other is what this is all about.

621
00:50:06,564 --> 00:50:07,365
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, everyone.

622
00:50:07,385 --> 00:50:08,947
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to sign off for now.

623
00:50:09,748 --> 00:50:18,560
[SPEAKER_01]: You can always go to AnnaCallahan.com slash getupdates to sign up there to make sure that you hear about future shows that we're going to have.

624
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:19,521
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll try and have them once a week.

625
00:50:19,902 --> 00:50:20,182
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

626
00:50:20,563 --> 00:50:20,863
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye bye.

627
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:21,464
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay safe.
