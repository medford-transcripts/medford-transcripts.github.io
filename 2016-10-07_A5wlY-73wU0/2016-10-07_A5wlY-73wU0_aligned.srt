1
00:00:15,342 --> 00:00:15,844
We fall into

2
00:01:04,802 --> 00:01:08,885
In what year did Medford High football team win their only Super Bowl?

3
00:01:08,905 --> 00:01:19,591
I'm Amber Harbisson with the Mustang Report and I'm here with Mr. Nas, the leader of the Stang Gang and the football team.

4
00:01:20,112 --> 00:01:22,073
So can you tell us a little bit about the Stang Gang?

5
00:01:22,113 --> 00:01:23,274
I know it's a new club this year.

6
00:01:24,696 --> 00:01:28,479
Yeah, so the stand gang is going to be great this year.

7
00:01:28,919 --> 00:01:31,882
We're really excited to have it rolling for this season.

8
00:01:32,242 --> 00:01:36,786
It's a pep squad, but it's basically like if you ever saw a college student section.

9
00:01:37,286 --> 00:01:39,468
And we have organized cheers and chants.

10
00:01:39,568 --> 00:01:43,991
And I think one big thing that we need as a school is much more school spirit.

11
00:01:44,091 --> 00:01:52,138
But I think if we can really hone in on the entire school population and try to bring everything together, it'll really be an awesome experience for everyone.

12
00:01:52,558 --> 00:01:54,599
And, you know, anyone can join the Stang Gang.

13
00:01:54,619 --> 00:01:57,619
You know, as long as you continue to show up, you're officially a part of the club.

14
00:01:57,779 --> 00:02:02,521
And we usually try to go to at least one or two, if we can squeeze it in, two big home games a week.

15
00:02:02,861 --> 00:02:06,242
So how do you think this is going to promote energy through your football team?

16
00:02:06,282 --> 00:02:11,723
And how do you think they're going to feel about the Stang Gang being there supporting them at their home games?

17
00:02:12,063 --> 00:02:14,084
I think this is going to bring it to the next level.

18
00:02:14,284 --> 00:02:18,185
This thing has the potential to really bring everyone together.

19
00:02:55,094 --> 00:03:13,840
You can tell them that I've been from hell and back When the heat is on, I fire back In this cold world, where your light is at Let's burn it down, I fire back You can tell them that I've been from hell and back

20
00:03:14,603 --> 00:03:21,093
In this cold world, where your lighters at?

21
00:03:21,274 --> 00:03:24,379
Let's burn it down, before I buy it back

22
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:49,983
let's take it to the ground don't too many make it coming through our town looking for a detour nowhere to be found when the pressure's on seems nobody's around uh but i won't let them see me sweat yeah it took a little time but can't really be upset long way to the top i could barely see the steps yeah they sleeping on

23
00:03:52,575 --> 00:03:54,136
At 400 yards, we have the winning structure.

24
00:03:54,337 --> 00:03:56,519
It's a little inaccurate, but 800 is good.

25
00:03:56,539 --> 00:03:58,320
This is the message to the world.

26
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:58,901
Take the 6.

27
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,022
Hi, I'm Amber, and I'm here with Coach Rugg.

28
00:04:24,162 --> 00:04:26,243
They just finished up the GBL meet.

29
00:04:26,544 --> 00:04:28,885
How do you guys think your team did?

30
00:04:28,945 --> 00:04:30,607
For the first time out, I'd say excellent.

31
00:04:31,747 --> 00:04:32,248
Very young.

32
00:04:32,628 --> 00:04:34,469
Most of our runners are first-year runners.

33
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:39,193
Most have never run anything like we've ran today, so very pleased with it today.

34
00:04:39,353 --> 00:04:45,458
And you guys have run cross-country all four years, and how is this year different from last year or your years before?

35
00:04:46,268 --> 00:04:50,110
Well, last year, we had a couple of really good seniors.

36
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,591
And it was sad to see them go.

37
00:04:52,711 --> 00:04:55,792
But this year, we also got a lot of new freshmen.

38
00:04:56,352 --> 00:05:01,674
So it's nice to see new talent and just people excited for the sport.

39
00:05:03,975 --> 00:05:06,176
Yeah, we have a lot of new people this year.

40
00:05:06,236 --> 00:05:08,497
So hopefully, we can build the team up for years to come.

41
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:38,313
You think back to last October when the shovels went into the dirt here, the snowflakes were flying, it was a little chilly, and who would think less than a year later, with the wind blowing just a little bit, that we would be celebrating this beautiful park that has so perfectly achieved its vision on a fall day that is nothing short of perfection.

42
00:05:44,774 --> 00:06:00,785
Oh, say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave?

43
00:06:03,867 --> 00:06:12,713
As today we gaze upon this beautiful new garden, let us pray for Crystal and for Martin, Lingzi and Sean,

44
00:06:14,659 --> 00:06:24,329
We pray for all those injured, for all that responded, somehow running towards the scene rather than away from it.

45
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:32,818
And it will mean not just for those who were lucky enough to know Crystal and Martin and Lindsay,

46
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:34,759
and Sean that they won't be forgotten.

47
00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:49,346
But it means those of us who never were lucky enough to know them will also have a place and a way to learn about them, to remember them, to honor not only the manner of their deaths, but the manner of their lives.

48
00:06:50,086 --> 00:06:55,829
I asked Patty Campbell the other day if it was really important that the word peace be in the name of the garden.

49
00:06:56,789 --> 00:07:05,891
She said, yes, because it's the reason people move to this country, because they want their families to be safe, and because that's what we believe.

50
00:07:06,451 --> 00:07:12,192
This morning, I ran the entire marathon course in memory of Crystal.

51
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:14,633
I had to.

52
00:07:16,173 --> 00:07:17,073
I had to reflect.

53
00:07:19,334 --> 00:07:25,875
I never met Crystal personally, but I felt she was with me every step of the way this morning.

54
00:07:27,838 --> 00:07:30,540
as were Martin and Lindsay and Shawn.

55
00:07:31,981 --> 00:07:47,592
This garden is a fitting tribute to Crystal, Sunflower, Martin, Baseball Glove, Lindsay, Books, and Shawn, Badge.

56
00:07:49,173 --> 00:07:55,678
And I don't have a lot to give, but what I do have that I want to give to the Crystal family

57
00:07:56,739 --> 00:08:00,020
is my Boston Marathon medal from 2013.

58
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:13,384
It symbolizes friendship, resolve, and most importantly, peace.

59
00:08:13,805 --> 00:08:17,686
On April 15, 2013 was a devastating and tragic day.

60
00:08:21,913 --> 00:08:31,740
but also a time when people came together to support one another with a renewed commitment for a better quality of life for all.

61
00:08:32,841 --> 00:08:36,184
That spirit is what this Peace Garden represents.

62
00:08:37,962 --> 00:08:39,483
We celebrate Crystal's life.

63
00:08:40,404 --> 00:08:45,769
She was a Medford Mustang class of 2001, an alumnus of UMass Boston.

64
00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:51,073
Crystal was a member of the Medford High School band and the girls' softball team.

65
00:08:52,054 --> 00:08:57,179
We celebrate her ongoing, fun-loving, deeply passionate and energetic life.

66
00:08:57,199 --> 00:09:00,742
Crystal lived life to the fullest.

67
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:08,938
She touched the hearts and souls of not only family and friends, but hearts and souls throughout the world.

68
00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:25,585
When this project began, Bill Campbell, Fiskel's dad, said he could not wait until it was finished, so he could bring his grandson, Billy III, and enjoy his company in the beauty of this park.

69
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:29,087
Bill, the word is out.

70
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,489
You are going to have a lot of company.

71
00:09:54,818 --> 00:09:57,342
As a community, we share in your sorrow.

72
00:09:58,203 --> 00:10:00,466
As a community, we share in your healing.

73
00:10:01,287 --> 00:10:03,009
And as a community, we are hopeful.

74
00:10:04,263 --> 00:10:20,474
We are hopeful that this special place in our city, a living memorial that countless individuals, entities contributed to, to bring to fruition, is a testament to the longing we all have for a peaceful, reflective space.

75
00:10:20,894 --> 00:10:31,822
In the days, weeks, and years following the horrific events, these families, first responders, and survivors have demonstrated pure strength by their actions and words,

76
00:10:32,542 --> 00:10:34,287
seen and heard around the world.
