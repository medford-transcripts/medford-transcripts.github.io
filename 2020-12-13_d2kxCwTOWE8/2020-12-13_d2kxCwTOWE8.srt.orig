00:00:02,119 --> 00:00:07,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, I am here with Joyce McKenzie, who owns Nelly's Wildflowers in Somerville.

2
00:00:08,582 --> 00:00:09,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Joyce, for being here.

3
00:00:09,603 --> 00:00:10,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

4
00:00:10,623 --> 00:00:12,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

5
00:00:13,044 --> 00:00:13,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, of course.

6
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:18,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you tell me a little bit about Nelly's, when it started and how you started?

7
00:00:19,511 --> 00:00:21,793
[SPEAKER_00]: We opened in 1990, April of 1990.

8
00:00:22,653 --> 00:00:27,197
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were going to be having our big 30th anniversary in April of this year.

9
00:00:27,217 --> 00:00:28,798
[SPEAKER_00]: That didn't happen.

10
00:00:28,878 --> 00:00:36,064
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we still, we have been here 30 plus years and I named it after my grandmother, Nellie.

11
00:00:37,005 --> 00:00:37,785
[SPEAKER_00]: Nellie is not my name.

12
00:00:38,946 --> 00:00:40,528
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone calls me Nellie and that's fine.

13
00:00:41,949 --> 00:00:45,772
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just specialize in wildflowers and unique things.

14
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:53,364
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been here in the neighborhood, and I live in the neighborhood, so I know a lot of people, which is great.

15
00:00:53,764 --> 00:00:58,069
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of my friends and neighbors come in all the time, a lot of the students from Tufts.

16
00:00:59,051 --> 00:01:01,153
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a great, great street.

17
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:02,294
[SPEAKER_00]: We just love it here.

18
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:11,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I have to say, you know this, but the viewers and listeners don't, but Nellie's well-forested my wedding.

19
00:01:11,355 --> 00:01:14,117
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have such a warm place in my heart for you guys.

20
00:01:14,137 --> 00:01:14,878
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

21
00:01:15,538 --> 00:01:16,419
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, thank you.

22
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:24,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so, you know, you obviously, COVID I'm sure affected your business.

23
00:01:24,305 --> 00:01:27,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you tell us a little bit about what it's been like and what it's like now?

24
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:37,947
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, um, you know, along with everybody else, I mean, we were just completely nervous and thrown and thought we were going to be closing, you know, we really thought this was it.

25
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:41,690
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought, okay, 30 years is a good, that's a good round number.

26
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,671
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll, we'll call it a day.

27
00:01:44,412 --> 00:01:51,998
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, my partner and I decided to just go on and we've been open ever since we actually never closed.

28
00:01:52,839 --> 00:01:58,141
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been just doing online ordering and we do free delivery here in the city.

29
00:01:58,161 --> 00:01:59,482
[SPEAKER_00]: Any amount.

30
00:02:00,322 --> 00:02:05,524
[SPEAKER_00]: We just felt like we wanted to do whatever would make people happy and keep us afloat.

31
00:02:05,784 --> 00:02:07,425
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been working.

32
00:02:08,905 --> 00:02:10,106
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I work a lot.

33
00:02:10,466 --> 00:02:11,286
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really tired.

34
00:02:13,087 --> 00:02:14,908
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really been working out.

35
00:02:15,148 --> 00:02:15,628
[SPEAKER_00]: So I

36
00:02:17,326 --> 00:02:27,448
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, COVID has been kind of a mixed blessing in a way, because it's just shown like who our true friends and followers are and supporters.

37
00:02:27,628 --> 00:02:31,729
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, people have just been so unbelievably generous and kind.

38
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:35,390
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just immeasurable for me.

39
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:36,990
[SPEAKER_00]: So.

40
00:02:38,371 --> 00:02:38,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

41
00:02:39,311 --> 00:02:39,511
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

42
00:02:41,066 --> 00:02:47,320
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure people would love to have flowers for the holidays, to get flowers for their loved ones for the holidays.

43
00:02:47,721 --> 00:02:49,425
[SPEAKER_02]: How can people shop with you?

44
00:02:50,191 --> 00:02:52,553
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're pretty accessible.

45
00:02:52,633 --> 00:02:56,136
[SPEAKER_00]: We have online ordering, as I said, and we are open.

46
00:02:56,156 --> 00:02:58,798

[SPEAKER_00]: We are open 9 to 5, Monday through Saturday.

48

49
00:03:06,304 --> 00:03:09,026
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are open to the public, so you can come into the store.

50
00:03:11,529 --> 00:03:23,429
[SPEAKER_00]: And we like I said we have free delivery in Somerville, but we have a wide delivery area to that we do have different delivery charges and things and minimums, but we'll go as far as Wellesley or.

51
00:03:24,933 --> 00:03:26,735
[SPEAKER_00]: up north to Wilmington.

52
00:03:26,755 --> 00:03:29,578
