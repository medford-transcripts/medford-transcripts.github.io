[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't mind just introducing yourself name pronouns and a bit about who you are.

11
00:00:50,121 --> 00:00:50,401
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

12
00:00:50,581 --> 00:00:51,803
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for having me.

13
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:52,605
[SPEAKER_01]: It's such an honor.

14
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:54,969
[SPEAKER_01]: I am Page Buldini she her.

15
00:00:55,871 --> 00:01:01,794
[SPEAKER_01]: I have lived in Medford, Massachusetts for over 15 years now, and I'm very excited to be running for city council.

16
00:01:02,315 --> 00:01:03,275
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me.

17
00:01:04,096 --> 00:01:05,236
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, things about me.

18
00:01:06,117 --> 00:01:10,839
[SPEAKER_01]: I own a small business, a skincare salon up in the Hillside by Tufts called page aesthetics.

19
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,841
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been here for over six years.

20
00:01:13,681 --> 00:01:20,625
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a proud mom of a seven-year-old rising second grader at Mississippi elementary school.

21
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:36,978
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love that I am on the board of the Chamber of Commerce, which has been such a really cool way for me to use my small business experience, specifically while I was running it opening during the pandemic, and then being a public school parent.

22
00:01:37,158 --> 00:01:41,521
[SPEAKER_01]: And then my husband also is from Medford, and we get to raise our daughter in the house that he grew up in.

23
00:01:41,721 --> 00:01:43,842
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just love all these ties to Medford, which are great.

24
00:01:44,826 --> 00:01:48,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, seems like you have, you know, you're in a lot of different areas in Medford.

25
00:01:48,129 --> 00:01:52,292
[SPEAKER_02]: So I hope that'll hopefully, hopefully inform our the rest of our conversation.

26
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:53,273
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.

27
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:59,097
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the first question I want to ask you that I ask everybody is just what is your favorite place to eat in Medford?

28
00:01:59,137 --> 00:02:00,238
[SPEAKER_02]: And what do you like to eat there?

29
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:07,122
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is so hard and I feel like out of this whole prep that because I love to prep before I get to speak with anyone.

30
00:02:07,142 --> 00:02:15,565
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's as a proud board member of the chamber and a member obviously with my business think there's something like over 130 different

31
00:02:17,506 --> 00:02:21,948
[SPEAKER_01]: food, restaurant, cafe, pizza shops in Medford.

32
00:02:21,968 --> 00:02:26,690
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, Oh, well, maybe I can just like go through every neighborhood and shout out my favorite ones.

33
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:31,952
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kept going and going, going, and then we would have like an hour of a podcast and we'll do that another day.

34
00:02:31,972 --> 00:02:41,095
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think to just save time, um, I would have to say Goldilocks bagels, which is my neighbor down right down the hill on the hillside.

35
00:02:41,755 --> 00:02:44,056
[SPEAKER_01]: And our true love story actually happened.

36
00:02:44,076 --> 00:02:45,137
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so funny.

37
00:02:45,697 --> 00:02:48,499
[SPEAKER_01]: They opened a few months after I did.

38
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:55,222
[SPEAKER_01]: And Lindsey, who we love, Lindsey and Ed, had posted on Instagram that they were short cash.

39
00:02:55,883 --> 00:03:03,887
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is, I mean, our businesses in customer service are a little different now, but, you know, a lot of credit cards are used now, but cash sometimes is too.

40
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:10,368
[SPEAKER_01]: So she just posted this story and I happen to have some cash at the moment, small bills and my husband sells beer at Fenway.

41
00:03:10,448 --> 00:03:11,268
[SPEAKER_01]: So he did too.

42
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:18,690
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just ran down the street and I brought like a bag of ones, like in a Ziploc and she was like, where do you get all this cash?

43
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:19,930
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, it's not that much.

44
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,470
[SPEAKER_01]: It just is our business.

45
00:03:21,931 --> 00:03:24,511
[SPEAKER_01]: And from there, she has beat Lindsay specifically.

46
00:03:24,551 --> 00:03:27,032
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love it to have become my small business besties.

47
00:03:27,812 --> 00:03:28,732
[SPEAKER_01]: I own a small business.

48
00:03:28,872 --> 00:03:30,632
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to run a small business solo.

49
00:03:30,792 --> 00:03:33,833
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also really rewarding when you find a friend.

50
00:03:34,273 --> 00:03:35,954
[SPEAKER_01]: who's navigating similar things.

51
00:03:36,314 --> 00:03:37,734
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to Goldilocks.

52
00:03:38,034 --> 00:03:40,235
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd have to say their breakfast sandwiches are phenomenal.

53
00:03:40,675 --> 00:03:46,777
[SPEAKER_01]: But my order, if you want to know, is an onion bagel with chive cream cheese, tomato and bacon.

54
00:03:46,817 --> 00:03:47,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Tomato and bacon.

55
00:03:47,597 --> 00:03:47,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Yum.

56
00:03:48,177 --> 00:03:48,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

57
00:03:48,537 --> 00:03:51,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Goldilocks is like probably the most mentioned.

58
00:03:51,258 --> 00:03:52,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

59
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:53,319
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they're just good.

60
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:55,639
[SPEAKER_01]: They're good humans and it's good food.

61
00:03:55,859 --> 00:03:56,120
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

62
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:56,960
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so easy.

63
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:57,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

64
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,200
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've been on the podcast there.

65
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,201
[SPEAKER_02]: They're very nice people.

66
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:00,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

67
00:04:01,471 --> 00:04:02,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy to promote them anytime.

68
00:04:03,714 --> 00:04:04,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, yeah.

69
00:04:06,678 --> 00:04:11,485
[SPEAKER_02]: So I invited you on to talk about your campaign for city council.

70
00:04:11,525 --> 00:04:18,614
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm wondering if you could share with us a little bit about kind of how you arrived at this moment, how you decided to run for city council.

71
00:04:19,136 --> 00:04:19,436
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

72
00:04:19,796 --> 00:04:20,637
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you for asking.

73
00:04:21,257 --> 00:04:24,818
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, honestly, a couple of years ago, this would never have been a thought in my mind.

74
00:04:24,918 --> 00:04:28,560
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like that's the best thing about really growing up.

75
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,881
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm 41 and I feel like I'm still just stepping into who I am.

76
00:04:31,901 --> 00:04:40,444
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think once my daughter went into public school, I was able to then realize I love owning my skincare salon.

77
00:04:40,684 --> 00:04:42,185
[SPEAKER_01]: I love being a parent.

78
00:04:42,609 --> 00:04:43,810
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was just something more.

79
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:46,252
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got the opportunity to be on the board for the chamber.

80
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:53,259
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got to be in the room with a lot of really cool business owners and decision makers in the city.

81
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,582
[SPEAKER_01]: And they kind of started listening to some of my ideas.

82
00:04:57,002 --> 00:05:03,949
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got to do some really cool collaborations, which one is coming up with Ron Medford and the Citywide PTOs.

83
00:05:04,468 --> 00:05:09,394
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of these fun ideas that are bouncing around in my head, I get to actually connect the people.

84
00:05:09,414 --> 00:05:16,882
[SPEAKER_01]: And also because I own a skate care salon, I get to have all walks of life come into my salon.

85
00:05:17,733 --> 00:05:21,976
[SPEAKER_01]: and they are vulnerable, they are real, and they share, and I get to listen.

86
00:05:22,496 --> 00:05:30,701
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have become a proud, active listener, and I feel like that's a really important attribute of any government, but any person.

87
00:05:30,901 --> 00:05:46,231
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like once it all kind of happened, somebody had mentioned it, it kind of got tossed around, and so I did a little bit more research, and I just felt like I have some really great experience through professional, my professional experience, and my family experience, and my life experience.

88
00:05:46,811 --> 00:05:47,572
[SPEAKER_01]: want to give it a whirl.

89
00:05:47,592 --> 00:05:49,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's great.

90
00:05:49,213 --> 00:05:49,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, I am.

91
00:05:50,935 --> 00:06:06,147
[SPEAKER_02]: My training, my work, I work as a therapist and I feel like it's always remarkable to me like going to different like going to the hair salon or like going to like different places where that like you probably have no training as a therapist, but I do it just as well of a job like listening.

92
00:06:06,187 --> 00:06:07,748
[SPEAKER_02]: So and I do appreciate that.

93
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:08,229
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's

94
00:06:09,429 --> 00:06:24,734
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of people come to local politics because they have some kind of ambition for themselves or they have some kind of priorities already, but being able to listen and hear what it is that the community wants and needs is an important thing.

95
00:06:24,754 --> 00:06:27,735
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for what you do, because that is very important.

96
00:06:27,775 --> 00:06:36,298
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have, ironically, have a degree in psychology from a million years ago at a manual college where I graduated in 06 in philosophy.

97
00:06:37,162 --> 00:06:40,344
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I would never ever say that I'm trained.

98
00:06:40,364 --> 00:06:43,327
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I just through my life experiences like to listen.

99
00:06:44,707 --> 00:06:47,289
[SPEAKER_01]: So the fact that you can do that and help people is awesome.

100
00:06:47,309 --> 00:06:50,371
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.

101
00:06:50,431 --> 00:06:58,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I also think like, you know, when people decide to run for these offices, like they maybe have some idea of

102
00:06:58,617 --> 00:06:59,698
[SPEAKER_02]: what they would do.

103
00:06:59,798 --> 00:07:04,362
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like you have an idea of what you appreciate about Medford.

104
00:07:04,402 --> 00:07:18,534
[SPEAKER_02]: You've kind of connected with some of these bigger kind of community groups and probably have already heard from people kind of what they are thinking about, what they're maybe proud of about Medford, what we think what's going well, but also things that they want to see change.

105
00:07:18,594 --> 00:07:26,180
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm wondering if elected, what your priorities would be there in terms of what you'd like to work for in terms of changing things in the city?

106
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,821
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question.

107
00:07:28,061 --> 00:07:31,085
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think a really wonderful thing that I have.

108
00:07:31,947 --> 00:07:47,918
[SPEAKER_01]: via my husband being from here and me not originally being from here is, I think Medford has such deep roots and such great history, but I think we're also on this cusp of like welcoming so many new people in and so many good new businesses.

109
00:07:48,359 --> 00:07:53,162
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like as a business owner, I really love making that easier.

110
00:07:54,063 --> 00:07:58,146
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the easiest way to do that would just make Medford open for business, right?

111
00:07:58,166 --> 00:07:59,767
[SPEAKER_01]: Like make City Hall,

112
00:08:00,307 --> 00:08:07,250
[SPEAKER_01]: a place where we can expedite, you know, like business, like it's hard to open a small business I guess I could say.

113
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:12,792
[SPEAKER_01]: So just making sure that the building department is prepared for that permitting is prepared for that.

114
00:08:13,132 --> 00:08:16,353
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also creating that good connection with the chamber so we can nourish that.

115
00:08:17,145 --> 00:08:19,567
[SPEAKER_01]: I think having strong communication is great.

116
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:29,494
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the way that I get to talk to my clients, whether it's through social media, through newsletters, so continuing to strengthen that, making our website easily accessible.

117
00:08:30,074 --> 00:08:31,315
[SPEAKER_01]: I talk about it all the time.

118
00:08:31,335 --> 00:08:34,437
[SPEAKER_01]: I promote the caches calendar.

119
00:08:35,032 --> 00:08:40,416
[SPEAKER_01]: to like 80% of my clients if they need to figure out something to do, cause it's so great.

120
00:08:40,857 --> 00:08:44,299
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love that it's on the Medford city's calendar.

121
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:50,024
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find it there too, but just making sure that residents can find the information they need very easily.

122
00:08:50,044 --> 00:09:01,293
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I think specifically with when I decided to run for city council, I kind of just literally Googled or chat to BT, what does the city councilor do?

123
00:09:02,316 --> 00:09:13,885
[SPEAKER_01]: And the three main reoccurring things are that the most not most important, but their main jobs are zoning ordinances and then like the general way that the community in the city government works.

124
00:09:14,486 --> 00:09:19,650
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel very lucky that I'm stepping into the midst of a big zoning conversation.

125
00:09:20,432 --> 00:09:30,215
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm learning so much and I love to learn so that's great and I feel like having the opportunity to have my clients and my neighbors ask me questions.

126
00:09:30,976 --> 00:09:34,897
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a person that really believes in getting as much information as possible.

127
00:09:35,986 --> 00:09:41,192
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't mean if it's aligned with myself or not, because I will always find something that I can learn.

128
00:09:41,212 --> 00:09:50,965
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that the zoning reform right now is something that is really important for everybody to just really fully understand and also have an opportunity to have a say.

129
00:09:51,637 --> 00:10:04,680
[SPEAKER_01]: Another cool thing that I learned about, because again, I'm learning from everywhere, is it isn't necessarily a typical way to have as many public meetings or have as many public opportunities for the community when it comes to zoning.

130
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,080
[SPEAKER_01]: So we actually have a lot.

131
00:10:07,921 --> 00:10:10,621
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have to say, though, it's really confusing to me.

132
00:10:11,101 --> 00:10:15,442
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you're following along, and you might be, and this is not to even ask that of you.

133
00:10:16,002 --> 00:10:18,203
[SPEAKER_01]: So to find a way, I've been advocating for like

134
00:10:18,843 --> 00:10:30,351
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, pictures of what this real life pictures of or simple zoning, not critiques, but like abbreviations and just really being able to ask those questions.

135
00:10:30,411 --> 00:10:35,455
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just engaged with Medford fire, Medford police and Medford schools.

136
00:10:35,495 --> 00:10:41,219
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's including like chiefs down to the union reps and just ask what, how they feel about it.

137
00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:46,943
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I feel like including every person that I possibly can to get a good informed

138
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:51,927
[SPEAKER_01]: just information is the best that I can do and then by sharing that.

139
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:54,748
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are kind of my big three.

140
00:10:55,749 --> 00:11:09,716
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty much honoring who we are, engaging who we're becoming, smart and transparent growth, small business support, obviously, and then communication are like my four big pillars that I'm actively trying to learn more about and get feedback from.

141
00:11:10,717 --> 00:11:17,040
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think the zoning issue is a good example of how like this, I think this like common problem in Medford that I've been hearing about

142
00:11:18,105 --> 00:11:22,688
[SPEAKER_02]: For 10 years is like, how do people get their information about what's going on?

143
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:26,891
[SPEAKER_02]: And this also the opposite issue of how do we understand what people want?

144
00:11:27,331 --> 00:11:30,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we know only certain people go to those meetings.

145
00:11:30,153 --> 00:11:34,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Only certain people are tuned into city council meetings and school committee meetings.

146
00:11:35,717 --> 00:11:43,860
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was working on the charter review, it was a big push to get input from community members, and it's a very complex issue.

147
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:48,182
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, you're like, how many people actually care about this?

148
00:11:48,282 --> 00:11:50,923
[SPEAKER_02]: And how do we find them and educate them about it?

149
00:11:50,983 --> 00:11:53,324
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that zoning is a really

150
00:11:54,324 --> 00:12:04,951
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really important issue I think one of the things that we've been hearing about too is like revenue in the city and our budget and how to like, we have all these new people coming in and how do we also welcome businesses.

151
00:12:05,351 --> 00:12:06,572
[SPEAKER_02]: And so sometimes I think that.

152
00:12:08,618 --> 00:12:21,022
[SPEAKER_02]: The way that I hear about zoning is that there can be some conflict between zoning for what business owners want versus what people who own homes in Medford want, and people who want to have affordable housing in Medford want.

153
00:12:21,042 --> 00:12:23,162
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think it's a very complex issue.

154
00:12:23,402 --> 00:12:25,083
[SPEAKER_02]: And I kind of wonder what you're hearing.

155
00:12:25,103 --> 00:12:28,784
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a great question.

156
00:12:28,904 --> 00:12:32,325
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like no matter what,

157
00:12:33,236 --> 00:12:35,838
[SPEAKER_01]: there's gonna be opinions that differ.

158
00:12:36,138 --> 00:12:38,180
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's really important.

159
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:46,066
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that's the only way that we can get as much opinion and also like enough people that feel like they're a part of it.

160
00:12:47,788 --> 00:12:56,095
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've heard all, I feel like I have really great friends that are excellent affordable housing advocates.

161
00:12:57,135 --> 00:12:59,117
[SPEAKER_01]: and architects and that's their world.

162
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:08,723
[SPEAKER_01]: I also have residents that don't feel that this is something for them, or feel that their neighborhood character will change.

163
00:13:09,687 --> 00:13:21,597
[SPEAKER_01]: As a business owner, so funny, I've newly been speaking at some of these meetings and I have heard public comment, negative and positive, which is fine because I'm putting myself out there and that's what happens, right?

164
00:13:22,498 --> 00:13:34,768
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like even if it feels negative coming at me, it's feedback and it's something, even if the delivery doesn't feel kind, there's something I can learn from there and that's been helpful.

165
00:13:35,428 --> 00:13:52,824
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I'm listening and speaking, I use my business where I'm currently right now, 319 Boston Ave, right on the Boston Ave corridor, which is a business district, as the perfect example of an area that should be rezoned for mixed use.

166
00:13:53,244 --> 00:13:55,746
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm literally putting my business

167
00:13:56,757 --> 00:13:58,178
[SPEAKER_01]: out there, also my neighbors.

168
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:01,119
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one level of nine units.

169
00:14:01,359 --> 00:14:03,920
[SPEAKER_01]: There should be housing and it should be affordable.

170
00:14:04,181 --> 00:14:06,582
[SPEAKER_01]: We're right near the green line, like we're right in 93 and 16.

171
00:14:07,862 --> 00:14:19,428
[SPEAKER_01]: However, as a business owner selfishly, I just was asking questions of, okay, so what were to happen if this building was incentivized to be redeveloped?

172
00:14:19,828 --> 00:14:21,989
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, how would we support the small businesses?

173
00:14:22,449 --> 00:14:24,270
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have gotten some information.

174
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:33,353
[SPEAKER_01]: But also another really cool plug that you didn't ask for, but it's so helpful, is the Medver public library, you can rent a librarian.

175
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:34,533
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you knew this.

176
00:14:35,113 --> 00:14:35,434
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

177
00:14:36,014 --> 00:14:36,274
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

178
00:14:36,874 --> 00:14:37,334
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I've done it.

179
00:14:37,374 --> 00:14:41,556
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done it once with Sam, who's awesome for some campaign assistance, and she was great.

180
00:14:41,896 --> 00:14:45,077
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I'm going to do it again with Jenna Barry, who is in the Resource Center.

181
00:14:45,905 --> 00:15:06,624
[SPEAKER_01]: and you can ask them a question and they will find every resource possible and it could be to like build a like a model airplane or learn how to run a campaign independently or it could be how do we create a business plan and they're saying we're not experts but we will find every resource we can so

182
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:13,965
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying to find that so essentially like my hope with this is, again, I don't think everybody will be happy.

183
00:15:14,946 --> 00:15:19,829
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally do feel like I need more information as I keep asking some people.

184
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,712
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think it would be wonderful.

185
00:15:22,792 --> 00:15:26,795
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some zoning of the districts has already gone through like I know.

186
00:15:28,376 --> 00:15:32,138
[SPEAKER_01]: over the Glenwood, like Salem Street has already gone through that district.

187
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:34,459
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Misty Gap Corridor has already gone through.

188
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:38,441
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are things that I don't know what they can do to kind of quote unquote go back.

189
00:15:38,581 --> 00:15:46,285
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do feel like if there was a way to separate them a little bit and have strong business district zoning,

190
00:15:46,985 --> 00:15:48,687
[SPEAKER_01]: figure it out, make sure we really do it.

191
00:15:48,767 --> 00:15:50,769
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to lose affordable housing here.

192
00:15:50,809 --> 00:15:51,970
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that's so important.

193
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:54,352
[SPEAKER_01]: And then really evaluate the residents.

194
00:15:54,652 --> 00:15:56,794
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that could be a potential compromise.

195
00:15:56,854 --> 00:16:00,458
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, I know that there's some people that feel like, I want it, let's do it.

196
00:16:00,538 --> 00:16:01,959
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people are like, I don't.

197
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,703
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of this funny place where I'm towing the line.

198
00:16:06,023 --> 00:16:09,086
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do I have publicly asked to slow it down a bit.

199
00:16:10,107 --> 00:16:11,608
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, that's fair to share.

200
00:16:12,169 --> 00:16:12,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

201
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:23,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it is definitely a complex issue and I feel like if you're following a lot of this on social media, it's really hard to know what's true.

202
00:16:23,768 --> 00:16:28,251
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually recently got this text message that was like a survey and maybe you've seen this.

203
00:16:28,691 --> 00:16:30,513
[SPEAKER_02]: It's full of misinformation.

204
00:16:33,815 --> 00:16:41,640
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, they were kind of conflating this with saying that the zoning reform would mean that nobody could build a single family home anymore, which is, like, I know not true.

205
00:16:43,081 --> 00:16:50,786
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, I mean, I think it's hard to, even at those meetings sometimes, like, the loudest people are saying things that maybe aren't necessarily true.

206
00:16:50,866 --> 00:16:52,868
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it can be hard to kind of sift through that.

207
00:16:53,548 --> 00:16:56,710
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I'm not envious of you for trying to figure that out.

208
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,292
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I think it's certainly a complex issue.

209
00:16:59,312 --> 00:17:01,173
[SPEAKER_02]: So I appreciate the time you're spending on it.

210
00:17:02,974 --> 00:17:24,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah and so I guess I'm curious too like so the theme of this podcast initially was just to sort of examine Medford from a place of like inclusivity and think about how like what things were doing well in the city but also maybe if you had any hopes for Medford in the future around things we could improve around like equity and inclusivity in our city.

211
00:17:24,931 --> 00:17:26,112
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm curious what you think.

212
00:17:26,614 --> 00:17:37,542
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so it's, it's so wonderful and timely I had, I can't quote unquote I don't know if I received it or not and I'm thinking positive, but I had a second interview with the Massachusetts women's political caucus.

213
00:17:38,423 --> 00:17:48,250
[SPEAKER_01]: And we spoke specifically about my views on certain things, but one thing that was really wonderful that I could share is as a skincare provider as I shared before I have

214
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:54,864
[SPEAKER_01]: all walks of life, every person, whoever they are, can come in here and feel themselves.

215
00:17:55,304 --> 00:18:07,373
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like coming at this campaign in the way that we could run the city to find a way, we don't all have to agree, but to find specific ways that we can make people feel valued and seen, I feel like that's great.

216
00:18:07,413 --> 00:18:10,235
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like our arts community does a really great job.

217
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:17,080
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I shouted out with Cashay before, I feel like really engaging in ways that people can feel creative,

218
00:18:17,673 --> 00:18:18,494
[SPEAKER_01]: can feel themselves.

219
00:18:18,874 --> 00:18:21,036
[SPEAKER_01]: It also supports like within our businesses.

220
00:18:21,136 --> 00:18:26,240
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that's a great way to amplify maybe you know bringing in different types of businesses.

221
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:41,312
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't necessarily all have to look the same and I feel like that would be a great opportunity to diversify but also be way more inclusive and I love that we have that opportunity with specifically even with some zoning changes and stuff that's going to allow some growth.

222
00:18:42,232 --> 00:18:44,674
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like within our schools it's been really cool.

223
00:18:45,434 --> 00:18:56,861
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure because obviously you know as well, just seeing my daughter within a member public school and the nexus program, and how it shows you know how to be a good friend and how to be a good advocate, and I just think.

224
00:18:57,721 --> 00:18:59,922
[SPEAKER_01]: she's in first will finish first grade.

225
00:19:00,062 --> 00:19:02,424
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are skills that she's learning.

226
00:19:02,444 --> 00:19:06,726
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, it could it doesn't have to be a big broad thing.

227
00:19:07,047 --> 00:19:10,629
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's coming back and making people feel valued and seen and heard.

228
00:19:10,689 --> 00:19:20,315
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like the more that we can kind of show that within the way that we're transparent with our communication, or we're open to show businesses are welcome here.

229
00:19:20,335 --> 00:19:20,995
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like

230
00:19:21,468 --> 00:19:25,551
[SPEAKER_01]: or we can continue to incorporate our arts, our music, our sports.

231
00:19:25,772 --> 00:19:27,953
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like those are just great ways that we can start.

232
00:19:27,973 --> 00:19:40,364
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't necessarily know what Mefford is doing, not even that you asked wrong, but I feel like there's a great opportunity for any of the quote unquote old and new or

233
00:19:41,392 --> 00:19:43,555
[SPEAKER_01]: different mindsets to actually start.

234
00:19:43,735 --> 00:19:51,625
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully either they don't have to look at each other, but we have some, we have a, Medford is on the cusp of something really wonderful.

235
00:19:52,106 --> 00:19:59,515
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like if we can continue to honor that, you know, the historic Med we have, but also be welcoming, I think that's a great opportunity.

236
00:20:00,707 --> 00:20:06,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's always interesting to me hearing from those two sides if we want to think about it like that.

237
00:20:06,991 --> 00:20:11,854
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do think that they have a lot more in common and they want to give each other credit for it.

238
00:20:11,874 --> 00:20:17,838
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think everybody that I talk to, even if I agree with them about nothing, can hear that they really care about Medford.

239
00:20:17,878 --> 00:20:24,202
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it comes across in a different way, but I think that it's a community where lots of people are really invested in.

240
00:20:25,042 --> 00:20:26,323
[SPEAKER_02]: making the best of our community.

241
00:20:26,363 --> 00:20:31,026
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I think breaking through some of the noise is helpful sometimes.

242
00:20:31,346 --> 00:20:38,491
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I do, I have been told that people don't necessarily want to come together and that is fair.

243
00:20:38,591 --> 00:20:43,514
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like that is not any of our jobs that ever change somebody.

244
00:20:43,554 --> 00:20:48,477
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like whoever you are, you should feel good about that and be true to your values.

245
00:20:49,377 --> 00:20:53,680
[SPEAKER_01]: But I feel like, and I think like Run Medford is a really great example where

246
00:20:54,200 --> 00:21:09,427
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple groups can come together to literally raise money for my for public schools, you know, and I feel like there's more of those like Oktoberfest, you know, for the chamber, we had that whole street filled with all different types of businesses.

247
00:21:09,507 --> 00:21:19,531
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, like Medford youth sports, and we had your awesome podcast, and it was just cool to see, again, they might not be politically aligned, they might not be

248
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:25,994
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, whatever type of their moral compass aligned, but we all had a blast.

249
00:21:26,514 --> 00:21:33,517
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like more of those opportunities, again, we don't have to get along, we don't have to be together, but I feel like that's kind of my hope.

250
00:21:33,718 --> 00:21:34,958
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I'm good at.

251
00:21:35,078 --> 00:21:38,960
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no idea how it started, but I think maybe it's the active listener role.

252
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:45,183
[SPEAKER_01]: I just pick up on these things and I'm like, oh, right, like that would make sense for that and refer it out and go.

253
00:21:46,058 --> 00:21:47,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and having the energy for it.

254
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:56,582
[SPEAKER_02]: I think like, you know, hearing from all the different sides of the, or like, different corners of the community and being able to connect the dots a little bit is definitely valuable.

255
00:21:57,762 --> 00:22:04,385
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious if you have any, like, upcoming, like, campaign events or anything that, anywhere we can find more information about your campaign that you want to put.

256
00:22:05,262 --> 00:22:05,802
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.

257
00:22:06,043 --> 00:22:08,524
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have my website, electpagefoldini.com.

258
00:22:08,684 --> 00:22:10,566
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also quite active on Facebook.

259
00:22:10,766 --> 00:22:13,047
[SPEAKER_01]: I have pagefoldini for my third city council.

260
00:22:13,688 --> 00:22:16,410
[SPEAKER_01]: I have an Instagram page, pagefoldini, simple.

261
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:23,715
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I will be, I have three upcoming barbecues that I will be posting on my newsletter.

262
00:22:23,735 --> 00:22:25,556
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, my website, I apologize.

263
00:22:26,056 --> 00:22:32,541
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm hoping to connect for a night at Colleen's and then my friends at Four Pizza have offered toast too.

264
00:22:32,701 --> 00:22:34,462
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will have that all up on my website

265
00:22:34,862 --> 00:22:36,323
[SPEAKER_01]: hopefully within the next couple weeks.

266
00:22:36,543 --> 00:22:39,725
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're just going to start walking around Medford.

267
00:22:40,045 --> 00:22:41,146
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very excited.

268
00:22:41,266 --> 00:22:46,989
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a little army of my neighborhood kids that are so fired up, which is really, really cool.

269
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:52,292
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so they want to have like bike parades, but I have told them that they're not allowed to put stuff in people's mailboxes.

270
00:22:52,452 --> 00:22:59,817
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you get something from me in your mailbox, it was probably from a seven year old and we apologize, but we're going to do our best.

271
00:23:00,117 --> 00:23:01,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, I think like, um,

272
00:23:02,963 --> 00:23:10,425
[SPEAKER_02]: when kids can connect with, that's the thing that's very cool about Medford is that city councilors are people that we all know, right?

273
00:23:10,485 --> 00:23:17,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Emily Lazzaro is like Evan and Sally's mom, that's how my kids know her, right?

274
00:23:17,227 --> 00:23:22,288
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, I think it's really cool when people can feel so connected to city officials.

275
00:23:22,348 --> 00:23:29,550
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know there's been a lot of back and forth about changing the way that we do our representation in city council, but I do think it's,

276
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:39,916
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, for me, I'm sure there are people that feel differently, but it's easy to access the city council, which means like if we have something that we're concerned about, we know who to bring it to.

277
00:23:39,996 --> 00:23:45,679
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think just feeling, and so it's really cool, like the kids in your neighborhood are behind your campaign.

278
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:52,542
[SPEAKER_01]: So, their vote for Page Buldini, we actually for my kickoff made temporary tattoos, which was a trip.

279
00:23:52,662 --> 00:23:56,424
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had like half of the Miss Tuck school had temporary tattoos, which I was like, sorry.

280
00:23:57,224 --> 00:23:58,945
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, their parents said yes.

281
00:23:59,065 --> 00:24:00,285
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're having fun.

282
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:03,046
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess it's a really cool way to be a role model.

283
00:24:04,227 --> 00:24:09,228
[SPEAKER_01]: Because no matter what, and I'm going to mess up 100%, and I'm going to ask for help.

284
00:24:10,309 --> 00:24:14,110
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm going to hopefully show my daughter that we can do those things.

285
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:15,331
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have to be perfect.

286
00:24:16,732 --> 00:24:27,681
[SPEAKER_01]: We can work really, really hard, but if it's coming from a space of I'm going to be as kind as I can be, I'm going to work as hard as I can be, and I'm going to try to listen.

287
00:24:27,701 --> 00:24:30,964
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that's the best I could do, and I'm excited for it.

288
00:24:31,624 --> 00:24:32,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, that's great.

289
00:24:32,665 --> 00:24:33,586
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a good model.

290
00:24:33,606 --> 00:24:38,330
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also a good model of like caring about your community and, you know, wanting to take care of each other.

291
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:39,511
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.

292
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:42,253
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm wondering if there's anything else that you want to mention before we wrap up.

293
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:51,025
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I was trying to think of what I was, so have, I guess I'm just going to keep plugging in the library, but have you been to the Medford room in the library, the little glass room?

294
00:24:51,525 --> 00:24:52,846
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never been inside, no.

295
00:24:53,607 --> 00:24:53,987
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody?

296
00:24:54,067 --> 00:25:00,191
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so Medford Public Library, if you're listening, endorse me, I'm just joking, but that room is really cool.

297
00:25:00,731 --> 00:25:03,073
[SPEAKER_01]: Open it up and it's really cool.

298
00:25:03,213 --> 00:25:12,279
[SPEAKER_01]: It's books that you can't, or items that you can't take out of the library because they're very old, but they have these drawers with files and they have all old press.

299
00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:13,560
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really cool.

300
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:18,945
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're making it all digital right now, so a lot of it is open, but I was looking at the maps.

301
00:25:19,085 --> 00:25:35,381
[SPEAKER_01]: They have the ward maps, and it's just really cool because I was trying to really envision what Medford in the past looked like, and now thinking about zoning and thinking about spots, and it's a really great way, I feel like, to stay grounded specifically with a lot that's going on.

302
00:25:35,817 --> 00:25:37,197
[SPEAKER_01]: to see like how far we come.

303
00:25:37,217 --> 00:25:42,438
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like with some true collaboration, I feel like there's some good stuff that can happen.

304
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:45,439
[SPEAKER_01]: So, no, I'm just so honored to have been a part of this.

305
00:25:45,479 --> 00:25:46,499
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for having me.

308
