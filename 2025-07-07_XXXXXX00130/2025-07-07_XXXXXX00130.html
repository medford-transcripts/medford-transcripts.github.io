    <p>[Page Buldini]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=120.94">So</a>  this is so hard and I feel like out of this whole prep that because I love to prep before I get to speak with anyone. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=127.142">Because</a>  there's as a proud board member of the chamber and a member obviously with my business think there's something like over 130 different <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=137.506">food,</a>  restaurant, cafe, pizza shops in Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=141.968">And</a>  I was like, Oh, well, maybe I can just like go through every neighborhood and shout out my favorite ones. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=146.99">And</a>  I kept going and going, going, and then we would have like an hour of a podcast and we'll do that another day. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=151.972">So</a>  I think to just save time, um, I would have to say Goldilocks bagels, which is my neighbor down right down the hill on the hillside. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=161.755">And</a>  our true love story actually happened. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=164.076">It</a>  was so funny. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=165.697">They</a>  opened a few months after I did. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=169.159">And</a>  Lindsey, who we love, Lindsey and Ed, had posted on Instagram that they were short cash. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=175.883">And</a>  this is, I mean, our businesses in customer service are a little different now, but, you know, a lot of credit cards are used now, but cash sometimes is too. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=184.267">So</a>  she just posted this story and I happen to have some cash at the moment, small bills and my husband sells beer at Fenway. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=190.448">So</a>  he did too. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=191.709">So</a>  I just ran down the street and I brought like a bag of ones, like in a Ziploc and she was like, where do you get all this cash? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=198.71">And</a>  I'm like, it's not that much. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=200.13">It</a>  just is our business. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=201.931">And</a>  from there, she has beat Lindsay specifically. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=204.551">And</a>  I love it to have become my small business besties. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=207.812">I</a>  own a small business. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=208.872">It's</a>  hard to run a small business solo. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=210.792">And</a>  it's also really rewarding when you find a friend. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=214.273">who's</a>  navigating similar things. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=216.314">So</a>  shout out to Goldilocks. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=218.034">I'd</a>  have to say their breakfast sandwiches are phenomenal. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=220.675">But</a>  my order, if you want to know, is an onion bagel with chive cream cheese, tomato and bacon.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=226.817">Tomato</a>  and bacon. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=227.597">Yum.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=228.177">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=228.537">Goldilocks</a>  is like probably the most mentioned. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=231.258">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Page Buldini]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=232.498">Well,</a>  they're just good. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=233.719">They're</a>  good humans and it's good food. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=235.859">Right.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=236.14">It's</a>  so easy.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=237.38">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=237.96">And</a>  they've been on the podcast there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=239.22">They're</a>  very nice people. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=240.221">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=241.471">Happy</a>  to promote them anytime. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=243.714">Great,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=246.678">So</a>  I invited you on to talk about your campaign for city council. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=251.525">So</a>  I'm wondering if you could share with us a little bit about kind of how you arrived at this moment, how you decided to run for city council.</p>

    <p>[Page Buldini]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=259.136">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=259.796">And</a>  thank you for asking. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=261.257">Um,</a>  honestly, a couple of years ago, this would never have been a thought in my mind. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=264.918">And</a>  I feel like that's the best thing about really growing up. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=268.82">I</a>  mean, I'm 41 and I feel like I'm still just stepping into who I am. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=271.901">And</a>  I think once my daughter went into public school, I was able to then realize I love owning my skincare salon. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=280.684">I</a>  love being a parent. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=282.609">And</a>  there was just something more. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=283.97">And</a>  I got the opportunity to be on the board for the chamber. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=287.053">And</a>  I got to be in the room with a lot of really cool business owners and decision makers in the city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=294.22">And</a>  they kind of started listening to some of my ideas. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=297.002">And</a>  we got to do some really cool collaborations, which one is coming up with Ron Medford and the Citywide PTOs. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=304.468">So</a>  some of these fun ideas that are bouncing around in my head, I get to actually connect the people. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=309.414">And</a>  also because I own a skate care salon, I get to have all walks of life come into my salon. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=317.733">and</a>  they are vulnerable, they are real, and they share, and I get to listen. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=322.496">So</a>  I have become a proud, active listener, and I feel like that's a really important attribute of any government, but any person. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=330.901">So</a>  I feel like once it all kind of happened, somebody had mentioned it, it kind of got tossed around, and so I did a little bit more research, and I just felt like I have some really great experience through professional, my professional experience, and my family experience, and my life experience. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=346.811">want</a>  to give it a whirl.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=347.592">Yeah,</a>  that's great. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=349.213">Yeah,</a>  no, I am. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=350.935">My</a>  training, my work, I work as a therapist and I feel like it's always remarkable to me like going to different like going to the hair salon or like going to like different places where that like you probably have no training as a therapist, but I do it just as well of a job like listening. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=366.187">So</a>  and I do appreciate that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=367.768">I</a>  think that's <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=369.429">I</a>  think a lot of people come to local politics because they have some kind of ambition for themselves or they have some kind of priorities already, but being able to listen and hear what it is that the community wants and needs is an important thing.</p>

    <p>[Page Buldini]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=384.754">Thank</a>  you for what you do, because that is very important. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=387.775">And</a>  I have, ironically, have a degree in psychology from a million years ago at a manual college where I graduated in 06 in philosophy. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=397.162">However,</a>  I would never ever say that I'm trained. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=400.364">I</a>  think I just through my life experiences like to listen. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=404.707">So</a>  the fact that you can do that and help people is awesome. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=407.309">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=410.431">Yeah,</a>  so I also think like, you know, when people decide to run for these offices, like they maybe have some idea of <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=418.617">what</a>  they would do. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=419.798">It</a>  sounds like you have an idea of what you appreciate about Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=424.402">You've</a>  kind of connected with some of these bigger kind of community groups and probably have already heard from people kind of what they are thinking about, what they're maybe proud of about Medford, what we think what's going well, but also things that they want to see change. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=438.594">And</a>  so I'm wondering if elected, what your priorities would be there in terms of what you'd like to work for in terms of changing things in the city?</p>

    <p>[Page Buldini]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=446.8">That's</a>  a great question. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=448.061">So</a>  I think a really wonderful thing that I have. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=451.947">via</a>  my husband being from here and me not originally being from here is, I think Medford has such deep roots and such great history, but I think we're also on this cusp of like welcoming so many new people in and so many good new businesses. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=468.359">So</a>  I feel like as a business owner, I really love making that easier. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=474.063">So</a>  I think the easiest way to do that would just make Medford open for business, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=478.166">Like</a>  make City Hall, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=480.307">a</a>  place where we can expedite, you know, like business, like it's hard to open a small business I guess I could say. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=487.73">So</a>  just making sure that the building department is prepared for that permitting is prepared for that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=493.132">And</a>  then also creating that good connection with the chamber so we can nourish that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=497.145">I</a>  think having strong communication is great. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=499.867">I</a>  love the way that I get to talk to my clients, whether it's through social media, through newsletters, so continuing to strengthen that, making our website easily accessible. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=510.074">I</a>  talk about it all the time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=511.335">I</a>  promote the caches calendar. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=515.032">to</a>  like 80% of my clients if they need to figure out something to do, cause it's so great. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=520.857">And</a>  I love that it's on the Medford city's calendar. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=524.78">You</a>  can find it there too, but just making sure that residents can find the information they need very easily. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=530.044">And</a>  then I think specifically with when I decided to run for city council, I kind of just literally Googled or chat to BT, what does the city councilor do? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=542.316">And</a>  the three main reoccurring things are that the most not most important, but their main jobs are zoning ordinances and then like the general way that the community in the city government works. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=554.486">So</a>  I feel very lucky that I'm stepping into the midst of a big zoning conversation. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=560.432">And</a>  I'm learning so much and I love to learn so that's great and I feel like having the opportunity to have my clients and my neighbors ask me questions. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=570.976">I</a>  am a person that really believes in getting as much information as possible. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=575.986">And</a>  it doesn't mean if it's aligned with myself or not, because I will always find something that I can learn. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=581.212">So</a>  I think that the zoning reform right now is something that is really important for everybody to just really fully understand and also have an opportunity to have a say. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=591.637">Another</a>  cool thing that I learned about, because again, I'm learning from everywhere, is it isn't necessarily a typical way to have as many public meetings or have as many public opportunities for the community when it comes to zoning. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=605.64">So</a>  we actually have a lot. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=607.921">I</a>  do have to say, though, it's really confusing to me. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=611.101">I</a>  don't know if you're following along, and you might be, and this is not to even ask that of you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=616.002">So</a>  to find a way, I've been advocating for like <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=618.843">you</a>  know, pictures of what this real life pictures of or simple zoning, not critiques, but like abbreviations and just really being able to ask those questions. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=630.411">And</a>  I just engaged with Medford fire, Medford police and Medford schools. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=635.495">And</a>  that's including like chiefs down to the union reps and just ask what, how they feel about it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=641.259">Cause</a>  I feel like including every person that I possibly can to get a good informed <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=648.105">just</a>  information is the best that I can do and then by sharing that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=652.287">So</a>  those are kind of my big three. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=655.749">It's</a>  pretty much honoring who we are, engaging who we're becoming, smart and transparent growth, small business support, obviously, and then communication are like my four big pillars that I'm actively trying to learn more about and get feedback from.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=670.717">Yeah,</a>  I think the zoning issue is a good example of how like this, I think this like common problem in Medford that I've been hearing about <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=678.105">For</a>  10 years is like, how do people get their information about what's going on? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=682.948">And</a>  this also the opposite issue of how do we understand what people want? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=687.331">Because</a>  we know only certain people go to those meetings. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=690.153">Only</a>  certain people are tuned into city council meetings and school committee meetings. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=695.717">When</a>  I was working on the charter review, it was a big push to get input from community members, and it's a very complex issue. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=703.88">First</a>  of all, you're like, how many people actually care about this? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=708.282">And</a>  how do we find them and educate them about it? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=710.983">But</a>  I think that zoning is a really <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=714.324">It's</a>  a really important issue I think one of the things that we've been hearing about too is like revenue in the city and our budget and how to like, we have all these new people coming in and how do we also welcome businesses. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=725.351">And</a>  so sometimes I think that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=728.618">The</a>  way that I hear about zoning is that there can be some conflict between zoning for what business owners want versus what people who own homes in Medford want, and people who want to have affordable housing in Medford want. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=741.042">And</a>  so I think it's a very complex issue. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=743.402">And</a>  I kind of wonder what you're hearing.</p>

    <p>[Page Buldini]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=745.103">Yeah,</a>  that's a great question. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=748.904">And</a>  I feel like no matter what, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=753.236">there's</a>  gonna be opinions that differ. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=756.138">And</a>  I think that's really important. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=758.74">I</a>  feel like that's the only way that we can get as much opinion and also like enough people that feel like they're a part of it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=767.788">So</a>  I've heard all, I feel like I have really great friends that are excellent affordable housing advocates. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=777.135">and</a>  architects and that's their world. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=779.237">I</a>  also have residents that don't feel that this is something for them, or feel that their neighborhood character will change. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=789.687">As</a>  a business owner, so funny, I've newly been speaking at some of these meetings and I have heard public comment, negative and positive, which is fine because I'm putting myself out there and that's what happens, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=802.498">And</a>  I feel like even if it feels negative coming at me, it's feedback and it's something, even if the delivery doesn't feel kind, there's something I can learn from there and that's been helpful. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=815.428">And</a>  when I'm listening and speaking, I use my business where I'm currently right now, 319 Boston Ave, right on the Boston Ave corridor, which is a business district, as the perfect example of an area that should be rezoned for mixed use. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=833.244">And</a>  I'm literally putting my business <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=836.757">out</a>  there, also my neighbors. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=838.938">It's</a>  one level of nine units. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=841.359">There</a>  should be housing and it should be affordable. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=844.181">We're</a>  right near the green line, like we're right in 93 and 16. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=847.862">However,</a>  as a business owner selfishly, I just was asking questions of, okay, so what were to happen if this building was incentivized to be redeveloped? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=859.828">you</a>  know, how would we support the small businesses? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=862.449">And</a>  I have gotten some information. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=865.07">But</a>  also another really cool plug that you didn't ask for, but it's so helpful, is the Medver public library, you can rent a librarian. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=873.373">I</a>  don't know if you knew this. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=875.113">No.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=876.014">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=876.874">Now</a>  I've done it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=877.374">I've</a>  done it once with Sam, who's awesome for some campaign assistance, and she was great. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=881.896">And</a>  now I'm going to do it again with Jenna Barry, who is in the Resource Center. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=885.905">and</a>  you can ask them a question and they will find every resource possible and it could be to like build a like a model airplane or learn how to run a campaign independently or it could be how do we create a business plan and they're saying we're not experts but we will find every resource we can so <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=908.1">Trying</a>  to find that so essentially like my hope with this is, again, I don't think everybody will be happy. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=914.946">I</a>  personally do feel like I need more information as I keep asking some people. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=920.67">I</a>  do think it would be wonderful. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=922.792">I</a>  know some zoning of the districts has already gone through like I know. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=928.376">over</a>  the Glenwood, like Salem Street has already gone through that district. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=932.298">I</a>  know Misty Gap Corridor has already gone through. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=934.799">So</a>  those are things that I don't know what they can do to kind of quote unquote go back. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=938.581">But</a>  I do feel like if there was a way to separate them a little bit and have strong business district zoning, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=946.985">figure</a>  it out, make sure we really do it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=948.767">I</a>  don't want to lose affordable housing here. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=950.809">I</a>  feel like that's so important. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=952.49">And</a>  then really evaluate the residents. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=954.652">I</a>  feel like that could be a potential compromise. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=956.854">But</a>  again, I know that there's some people that feel like, I want it, let's do it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=960.538">And</a>  some people are like, I don't. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=962.64">So</a>  it's kind of this funny place where I'm towing the line. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=966.023">But</a>  I do I have publicly asked to slow it down a bit. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=970.107">So</a>  that's, that's fair to share.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=972.169">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=973.12">Yeah,</a>  it is definitely a complex issue and I feel like if you're following a lot of this on social media, it's really hard to know what's true. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=983.768">I</a>  actually recently got this text message that was like a survey and maybe you've seen this. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=988.691">It's</a>  full of misinformation. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=993.815">Like,</a>  they were kind of conflating this with saying that the zoning reform would mean that nobody could build a single family home anymore, which is, like, I know not true. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1003.081">And</a>  so, yeah, I mean, I think it's hard to, even at those meetings sometimes, like, the loudest people are saying things that maybe aren't necessarily true. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1010.866">And</a>  so it can be hard to kind of sift through that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1013.548">So,</a>  you know, I'm not envious of you for trying to figure that out. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1016.85">But</a>  yeah, I think it's certainly a complex issue. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1019.312">So</a>  I appreciate the time you're spending on it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1022.974">Yeah</a>  and so I guess I'm curious too like so the theme of this podcast initially was just to sort of examine Medford from a place of like inclusivity and think about how like what things were doing well in the city but also maybe if you had any hopes for Medford in the future around things we could improve around like equity and inclusivity in our city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1044.931">So</a>  I'm curious what you think.</p>

    <p>[Page Buldini]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1046.614">Yeah,</a>  so it's, it's so wonderful and timely I had, I can't quote unquote I don't know if I received it or not and I'm thinking positive, but I had a second interview with the Massachusetts women's political caucus. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1058.423">And</a>  we spoke specifically about my views on certain things, but one thing that was really wonderful that I could share is as a skincare provider as I shared before I have <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1069.24">all</a>  walks of life, every person, whoever they are, can come in here and feel themselves. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1075.304">And</a>  I feel like coming at this campaign in the way that we could run the city to find a way, we don't all have to agree, but to find specific ways that we can make people feel valued and seen, I feel like that's great. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1087.413">And</a>  I feel like our arts community does a really great job. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1090.375">And</a>  as I shouted out with Cashay before, I feel like really engaging in ways that people can feel creative, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1097.673">can</a>  feel themselves. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1098.874">It</a>  also supports like within our businesses. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1101.136">I</a>  feel like that's a great way to amplify maybe you know bringing in different types of businesses. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1106.28">They</a>  don't necessarily all have to look the same and I feel like that would be a great opportunity to diversify but also be way more inclusive and I love that we have that opportunity with specifically even with some zoning changes and stuff that's going to allow some growth. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1122.232">I</a>  feel like within our schools it's been really cool. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1125.434">I'm</a>  sure because obviously you know as well, just seeing my daughter within a member public school and the nexus program, and how it shows you know how to be a good friend and how to be a good advocate, and I just think. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1137.721">she's</a>  in first will finish first grade. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1140.062">And</a>  these are skills that she's learning. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1142.444">And</a>  again, it could it doesn't have to be a big broad thing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1147.047">But</a>  it's coming back and making people feel valued and seen and heard. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1150.689">And</a>  I feel like the more that we can kind of show that within the way that we're transparent with our communication, or we're open to show businesses are welcome here. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1160.335">I</a>  feel like <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1161.468">or</a>  we can continue to incorporate our arts, our music, our sports. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1165.772">I</a>  feel like those are just great ways that we can start. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1167.973">I</a>  don't necessarily know what Mefford is doing, not even that you asked wrong, but I feel like there's a great opportunity for any of the quote unquote old and new or <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1181.392">different</a>  mindsets to actually start. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1183.735">Hopefully</a>  either they don't have to look at each other, but we have some, we have a, Medford is on the cusp of something really wonderful. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1192.106">And</a>  I feel like if we can continue to honor that, you know, the historic Med we have, but also be welcoming, I think that's a great opportunity.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1200.707">Yeah,</a>  it's always interesting to me hearing from those two sides if we want to think about it like that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1206.991">And</a>  I do think that they have a lot more in common and they want to give each other credit for it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1211.874">But</a>  I think everybody that I talk to, even if I agree with them about nothing, can hear that they really care about Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1217.878">I</a>  think it comes across in a different way, but I think that it's a community where lots of people are really invested in. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1225.042">making</a>  the best of our community. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1226.363">So,</a>  you know, I think breaking through some of the noise is helpful sometimes.</p>

    <p>[Page Buldini]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1231.346">Yeah,</a>  and I do, I have been told that people don't necessarily want to come together and that is fair. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1238.591">And</a>  I feel like that is not any of our jobs that ever change somebody. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1243.554">I</a>  feel like whoever you are, you should feel good about that and be true to your values. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1249.377">But</a>  I feel like, and I think like Run Medford is a really great example where <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1254.2">multiple</a>  groups can come together to literally raise money for my for public schools, you know, and I feel like there's more of those like Oktoberfest, you know, for the chamber, we had that whole street filled with all different types of businesses. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1269.507">And,</a>  you know, like Medford youth sports, and we had your awesome podcast, and it was just cool to see, again, they might not be politically aligned, they might not be <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1279.911">you</a>  know, whatever type of their moral compass aligned, but we all had a blast. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1286.514">And</a>  I feel like more of those opportunities, again, we don't have to get along, we don't have to be together, but I feel like that's kind of my hope. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1293.718">And</a>  that's what I'm good at. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1295.078">I</a>  have no idea how it started, but I think maybe it's the active listener role. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1299.38">I</a>  just pick up on these things and I'm like, oh, right, like that would make sense for that and refer it out and go.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1306.058">Yeah,</a>  and having the energy for it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1307.919">I</a>  think like, you know, hearing from all the different sides of the, or like, different corners of the community and being able to connect the dots a little bit is definitely valuable. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1317.762">I'm</a>  curious if you have any, like, upcoming, like, campaign events or anything that, anywhere we can find more information about your campaign that you want to put.</p>

    <p>[Page Buldini]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1325.262">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1326.043">So</a>  I have my website, electpagefoldini.com. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1328.684">I'm</a>  also quite active on Facebook. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1330.766">I</a>  have pagefoldini for my third city council. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1333.688">I</a>  have an Instagram page, pagefoldini, simple. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1337.15">And</a>  then I will be, I have three upcoming barbecues that I will be posting on my newsletter. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1343.735">I</a>  mean, my website, I apologize. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1346.056">And</a>  then I'm hoping to connect for a night at Colleen's and then my friends at Four Pizza have offered toast too. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1352.701">So</a>  I will have that all up on my website <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1354.862">hopefully</a>  within the next couple weeks. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1356.543">And</a>  then we're just going to start walking around Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1360.045">I'm</a>  very excited. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1361.266">I</a>  have a little army of my neighborhood kids that are so fired up, which is really, really cool. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1367.49">Um,</a>  so they want to have like bike parades, but I have told them that they're not allowed to put stuff in people's mailboxes. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1372.452">So</a>  if you get something from me in your mailbox, it was probably from a seven year old and we apologize, but we're going to do our best.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1380.117">Yeah,</a>  no, I think like, um, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1382.963">when</a>  kids can connect with, that's the thing that's very cool about Medford is that city councilors are people that we all know, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1390.485">Like</a>  Emily Lazzaro is like Evan and Sally's mom, that's how my kids know her, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1397.227">So</a>  it's like, I think it's really cool when people can feel so connected to city officials. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1402.348">And</a>  I know there's been a lot of back and forth about changing the way that we do our representation in city council, but I do think it's, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1410.57">I</a>  mean, for me, I'm sure there are people that feel differently, but it's easy to access the city council, which means like if we have something that we're concerned about, we know who to bring it to. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1419.996">And</a>  I think just feeling, and so it's really cool, like the kids in your neighborhood are behind your campaign.</p>
