    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=0.089s">elect</a>  to do something different anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=4.252s">And</a>  I think that's an important question. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=6.253s">The</a>  answer to what really is the, you know, what really is the perspective and opinion of those impacted is something that's sort of on my mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=14.899s">And</a>  then I think along the way, we hear lots of questions about like, <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=21.078s">the</a>  policies around how far we will bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=26.461s">I</a>  drive by the high school somewhat regularly at about the time kids are already supposed to be in class and there's still like an endless stream of cars dropping kids off. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=35.626s">And</a>  I do wonder how anybody gets to school on time because the number of cars going in and out, you know, clearly dropping people off is pretty staggering. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=46.472s">which</a>  suggests that we're not providing transportation in some capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=50.494s">So</a>  I think the goal is just for us to think about what kind of survey we could provide that would help us start to get some answers grounded in the people who use the services. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=63.963s">to</a>  really think about what are the problems, whether they're solved by a new contract or they're more immediately solvable, and how do we have some facts to move forward with? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=75.872s">So</a>  that was the goal of this whole effort to begin with. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=80.196s">But</a>  I did see earlier today that the district launched a Smart Routes to School survey, and I was curious if anybody could tell us about that and <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=91.105s">what</a>  it's what the questions are and who gets the data and what the goals are because I think that does complicate anything we're going to do here like we can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=101.957s">put</a>  out to transportation surveys in hot succession and expect that people are not going to be confused by that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=108.802s">So</a>  when we ultimately get to talking about what goes in the survey and timing, I think that'll be important. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=114.585s">So</a>  I didn't know if anybody could tell us a little bit about what that survey is even all about that went out today.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=120.649s">Dr.</a>  Cushing, are you able to respond to member Graham's question? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=126.613s">He</a>  has been involved with <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=129.315s">safe</a>  routes to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=130.836s">So</a>  let me just try calling him to jump back on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=135.398s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=138.08s">And</a>  if he can't, my wife has been involved with this group, so I can speak to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=142.682s">And</a>  I spoke with Ellery as well, but I'd love to hear where the district is coming from on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=147.724s">But</a>  it is a three question survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=149.805s">I</a>  can pull it up, actually.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=151.066s">Oh,</a>  OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=152.367s">I</a>  literally just saw it as I was signing in and I was like, yeah, I</p>

    <p>[Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=157.089s">I</a>  had reached out to the Safe Routes to Schools people to say, hey, is there anything you'd want us to keep in mind? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=163.574s">And</a>  they said, oh, actually, this thing that has been kind of chugging along slowly is set to launch tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=169.219s">So</a>  it was, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=171.641s">So</a>  the <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=174.025s">The</a>  survey itself is run by Safe Routes to Schools, which is a statewide group that does local advocacy and assessments. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=183.351s">And</a>  it is a very basic survey, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=187.313s">So</a>  if you click on where you live, whoops, and then you answer questions about your child. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=197.919s">How</a>  do you get to school? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=198.94s">How</a>  do you get from school? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=200.901s">And</a>  this is it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=203.174s">So</a>  it's not comprehensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=204.635s">I</a>  know this group is interested in getting more data about what stops people from active transportation, walking, biking, rolling this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=216.201s">But</a>  this survey is just this assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=218.483s">I</a>  believe it goes to the state organization of Safe Routes to Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=224.146s">They</a>  do the data and provide a report. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=232.748s">I</a>  have the report from the Roberts from 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=234.95s">It</a>  used to be done by school, and I think they're pretty excited. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=239.454s">Hi,</a>  Kitty, about having a comprehensive approach from the district on this, but it's really focusing on alternative transportation.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=250.103s">Okay,</a>  that is super helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=252.705s">Thank</a>  you, Member Reinfeld. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=254.687s">So</a>  I thought what we could do today is use the time that we have to start to <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=261.94s">brainstorm</a>  and think about, like, sort of the questions that we have that we would want to have vetted by this survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=270.222s">And</a>  to the extent that we can, you know, craft any questions that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=273.923s">And</a>  then perhaps Megan and I can work offline to sort of flesh out a draft to bring back to this group at a future meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=284.405s">And</a>  so I have a literal blank piece of paper here that I'm happy to share and we can walk through and just do some brainstorming until it can sort of evolve into something a little bit more formalized, if that works for the group, yeah? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=302.356s">Okay,</a>  I'm gonna share my screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=311.002s">Okay,</a>  you all see my screen?</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=314.059s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=315.319s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=319.3s">Okay,</a>  so I think, you know, sort of one thing that we probably want to be clear about is our questions to answer via the survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=332.103s">And</a>  then the other thing is, you know, what survey questions are we thinking we'll ask? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=342.354s">My</a>  typing always goes downhill when I'm sharing my screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=352.402s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=354.564s">So</a>  I would be happy to hear from any of you if you, I have some thoughts, but I will yield my thoughts to the group if anybody has anything they want to throw out there.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=372.628s">So</a>  I did just Google for some examples of transportation surveys for school districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=381.035s">This</a>  one has 21 questions, which I am just reading right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=386.259s">There</a>  are questions about the bell schedule, which is interesting to have as part of that survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=395.767s">I</a>  can't see the answers because the dropdowns have <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=400.99s">presumably</a>  lots of options, but it is a survey that is closed, so they won't let you drop down and see what's behind there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=409.353s">You</a>  know, there's questions about the, you know, transportation experience, positives, surprising, that kind of stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=420.898s">I</a>  also put into the chat the safe routes to schools <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=425.388s">I</a>  believe this is a sample of what their actual report looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=433.154s">And</a>  it does have, as Member Reinfeld pointed out, it's very basic. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=439.899s">You</a>  know, when people are using it is sort of what I'm getting at, getting is how do people get to school, percentages, days of the week, the morning and the afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=456.307s">Interestingly,</a>  they have a thing about weather conditions, which is good. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=461.573s">If</a>  we plan everything around, everybody bikes and the entire system falls apart because it isn't always biking weather, for instance, that could be a problem.</p>

    <p>[Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=478.114s">question.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=478.314s">I</a>  think I'm right, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=479.254s">Yes</a>  one meta question I have is whether we're looking to have an assessment and understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=485.656s">The</a>  what are the obstacles to participating in district provided transportation or alternative methods versus what could the district do differently? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=495.078s">That</a>  would shift your transportation behavior because those are kind of two different approaches to</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=504.978s">good</a>  question. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=505.678s">And</a>  I think the other thing on my mind is we need to, I think in terms of like how we get responses, we need to know like at baseline, each person who's answering the survey, how did they get to school today? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=524.662s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=528.001s">does</a>  that meet their needs? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=530.202s">And</a>  if it doesn't, what is it that they would identify as the thing that would meet their needs? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=536.745s">So</a>  as an example, my ninth grader walks to school and that meets my needs because we live less than a half a mile from the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=549.002s">I</a>  might feel differently if my ninth grader walked to school, but we live two miles from the high school, which technically means she's supposed to walk to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=559.087s">And</a>  I might say in that case, like I, my kid walks to school, but it does not meet my needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=564.329s">And</a>  I would like the district to provide transportation so that she doesn't have to walk two miles to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=570.011s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=570.632s">So</a>  I think like understanding sort of how, how it works today for the respondents and <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=578.928s">whether</a>  that meets their needs or not, and if it doesn't, like what would, I think is an important way to think about how we want to drive out these questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=592.536s">And</a>  I think it maybe is both of those things, member Reinfeld, like maybe it is like, is it that I need the district to do something different or I need to do something different, like what, you know, is it that, <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=609.312s">there's</a>  some barrier that's not allowing me to do the thing that I want to do, or is it simply like, I need a yellow bus to come pick up my kid in order for me to say that this meets my needs? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=619.982s">And</a>  I think we're going to get a whole bunch of different answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=622.704s">But</a>  when it relates to students, the high school students in particular, I think one question I would want to dial in on is, if they are <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=634.202s">using</a>  a bus to get to school today, what kind of bus are they using? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=637.423s">And</a>  like, does that meet their needs? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=639.603s">And</a>  if it doesn't, what would? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=641.984s">Which</a>  might help us understand like the MBTA question around like, what are the preferences of the students riding and their families for that matter? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=658.067s">So</a>  that we can <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=662.999s">respond</a>  accordingly, you know, and consider like what that means for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=670.085s">I'm</a>  going to share this document.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=672.287s">So</a>  is this being created in your personal Gmail or in school? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=676.27s">Okay,</a>  just check. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=677.591s">Nope.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=680.993s">I</a>  hate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=684.977s">I</a>  also, I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=687.305s">As</a>  you were just speaking, I was wondering about whether or not, you know, looking at the survey, Safe Routes to School survey, this appears to be a survey to parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=700.289s">And</a>  I think that's an important group to ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=706.19s">We</a>  have questions for parents, caregivers, but I feel like there needs to be questions <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=715.859s">to</a>  the users, the students, as well, especially for the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=721.723s">And</a>  I feel like they're very different kinds of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=728.688s">Oh,</a>  it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=729.248s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=729.688s">And</a>  high school students. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=730.689s">Thank</a>  you, Tom. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=733.071s">Good.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=737.313s">You</a>  know, looking at their data, though, I'm frankly nervous. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=741.756s">Like</a>  they have <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=743.675s">Each</a>  day, the morning and the afternoon, transportation, the data broken up by each of those, which is 10 different things, which of course makes sense to want that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=756.182s">It's</a>  a lot of data and I'm hopeful we don't have to replicate anything that we have coming out of Safe Routes to School survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=765.428s">Hopefully</a>  we can scratch it off the list instead of asking those questions again.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=773.576s">Well,</a>  I'm not convinced. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=774.757s">Well,</a>  first of all, I'm not convinced that we would even have access to that data in a raw form, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=781.103s">Like</a>  this is, I mean, I suppose we could ask for it, but more than likely we're going to get a report, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=789.051s">That</a>  provides, I think we're going to have to ask some, maybe some questions more than, you know, again, because I think we would want to be able to attribute them <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=800.137s">within</a>  our own data set, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=806.841s">And</a>  Megan, I'm so glad that you're able to join us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=809.002s">I</a>  know that you and I have talked about this a few times like over the course of time, but I'm curious, you know, based on what your office feels in terms of questions about transportation, like what's on your mind as we think about like what people, what information we need to get from people? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=834.073s">Oh,</a>  you can't unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=836.176s">Hold</a>  on.</p>

    <p>[Megan Fidler-Carey]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=837.057s">Oh,</a>  there we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=839.099s">Yeah,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=840.461s">Okay,</a>  there we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=841.982s">Um,</a>  so I mean we certainly <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=845.868s">So</a>  I am right in the middle of it because I know what can be done with the resources as they exist and then what the policies say. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=853.736s">So</a>  if we were to change some of the policies to meet some of the unmet demands of the families, we wouldn't be able to meet those policy demands now because we don't have the infrastructure for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=866.268s">So</a>  this bus driver shortage thing is so real. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=869.511s">However,</a>  I'm with you, Jenny, that like, the hardest part was we cracked down a little bit on the policy distances. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=877.753s">And</a>  we got rid of some bus stops that were, especially at the elementary school level, we got rid of some bus stops that were inside the one mile mark. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=884.715s">So</a>  we weren't obligated by policy to bus those students. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=888.356s">And</a>  then the families just, you know, they got savvy, and they just walked up to the next bus stop, and it was like, 30 kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=895.458s">And</a>  so, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=897.116s">I</a>  was preparing myself to crack down on those 30 kids, but I was thinking specifically about which families they were, what neighborhood they come from, and what the sort of PR fallout of having such a huge group all at once would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=911.667s">So,</a>  I mean, I know that that's a lot of kind of anecdotal parts of the details, but it's an important part for this group to be thinking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=922.394s">But</a>  I think that what I would see a lot of is to rethink those, <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=926.547s">policies</a>  because they are too far. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=930.26s">And</a>  we as a district, and I'm committed to doing this this summer, need to also commit to kind of rebuilding community to talk to them about how to not be super scared of walking to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=943.55s">So</a>  luckily, the new manager at Eastern Bus and I, we have just a sort of plan in place for this summer that we're going to, she's going to, we're going to drive all the routes together and she's going to make them more efficient and we're going to make them <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=957.62s">to</a>  policy so that we're not, you know, taking too many kids that are not eligible. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=963.944s">And</a>  I'm going to reach out and talk to families in the in the neighborhoods that have historically been kind of like getting on the bus, but they're not eligible to and offer meetups. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=974.449s">I'm</a>  going to work with the Met Family Network where it's appropriate to offer meetups to be like, let's all walk to school together. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=980.753s">And</a>  this is where <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=982.974s">I'd</a>  like to, you know, work with Ellery. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=984.976s">Ellery</a>  reached out to me and I haven't had a chance to get back to her about Safe Routes to School, to find out what resources we have to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=991.282s">It's</a>  sort of a teaching people how to walk to school, which sounds funny that we need to be so explicit about it, but we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=998.829s">And,</a>  you know, sort of introducing people like this is who you would walk with, and it's okay, you can trust your kids with these people to walk to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1008.908s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1009.488s">Those</a>  are a lot of anecdotal stories, but that's what I'm constantly working between. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1015.889s">The</a>  push of families saying, it's too far for my kids to walk, so I need a seat on the bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1022.491s">And</a>  the bus is all being overcrowded because there's a driver shortage. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1025.451s">So</a>  even students that are eligible, there aren't enough seats, and so the bus has become unsafe. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1031.433s">And</a>  the pushback that I want to give to say, we need to build some independence in the kids and start walking with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1039.096s">So</a>  that's where we are with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1040.897s">But</a>  as far as at the high school level, adding yellow buses at the high school, I've just done informal surveys with those students. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1048.66s">I</a>  would love to see a formal survey with actual student voice to find out how they feel about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1054.302s">Because</a>  I think that if we went to the expense of adding the yellow buses for all of the high school students that are eligible for them, we would have a lot of empty buses. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1066.367s">Hi,</a>  Lucy, I'm sorry, I'm on a Zoom call. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1070.316s">Um,</a>  we would have a lot of yellow buses that were, you know, barely full, and it would be very expensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1077.022s">In</a>  fact, I did the math once and said that it would be cheaper for us to give to pay for all of the MBTA M cards for every student in the high school than it would be to have the 14 required yellow buses to take bus every kid. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1095.218s">Now,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1097.563s">Again,</a>  I don't know how many of the kids would use those so that would be a waste. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1100.865s">The</a>  other part about this is what a waste of money it feels like because when we were paying for MBTA buses for students, we could tell that a lot of them weren't even using them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1109.749s">So</a>  we were spending $30 on a month for students for the just in case one day a week that they might use it but otherwise they were getting a ride from their friends or they're driving themselves or they were getting it from their parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1121.789s">So</a>  that didn't, that was just painful to watch all that money kind of fly out the window. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1125.99s">So</a>  I think that the high school survey would be very valuable, very interesting to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1131.131s">And</a>  their parents, you know, because we just got an email today from a parent saying that she's very uncomfortable with her student driving in cars with friends and that he does take the yellow bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1139.193s">And</a>  so I think the parent's voice needs to be in that survey as well.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1143.154s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1145.214s">And</a>  then Megan, I know the, <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1149.141s">the</a>  questions or the concerns probably are different at different levels, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1153.404s">Like</a>  at elementary, I would expect to see lots of different kinds of feedback than at middle school and at high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1167.153s">So</a>  I'm curious if there are other questions, like what else do we want to know about in terms of our bus <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1179.807s">ridership,</a>  I guess I'll say, or transportation that we haven't talked about so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1185.909s">And</a>  one thing that comes to mind is like some explicit questions about late busing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1190.711s">And</a>  so I know, you know, over the years, that's even been a question at the elementary school level, like there have been a handful of instances where we've provided <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1200.383s">yellow</a>  late buses to programs at the elementary school, although it always struck me as like a one-off thing that was sort of happening.</p>

    <p>[Megan Fidler-Carey]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1209.532s">Yeah,</a>  the only one I know about that was when we had ESSER funding and we were doing sort of tutoring, like ESSER, the catch-up <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1219.673s">catch</a>  up tutoring for elementary school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1221.634s">And</a>  so we provided transportation for that.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1223.554s">Right,</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1224.995s">And</a>  so, but I think late busing in general is a question that we should probably try to get the answer to. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1232.518s">I</a>  know I've heard like, and I sort of wondered about this for forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1237.379s">My</a>  middle schooler does afterschool sports. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1241.921s">They're</a>  very scheduled. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1243.141s">They're</a>  totally predictable. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1244.462s">They</a>  start after the late bus leaves the middle school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1247.891s">Like,</a>  it feels a little bit insane that we would have a school sponsored activity and we would intentionally started after transportation options exist for the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1261.903s">So</a>  that's, you know, I think when I think of the late bus, I think of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1266.447s">Like</a>  my kids, because when they're in middle school, they ride past the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1271.048s">They</a>  report about overcrowding on days where there's middle school athletes going from the middle school to the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1279.21s">I</a>  hear the same thing about the library, which is a hot spot for middle school dating, which always makes me giggle. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1287.893s">So</a>  there's like sort of hot spots around the city that, you know, sort of flare up at different times of the day that I think are worth sort of pursuing as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1298.028s">And</a>  this, I see somebody from, is that Peter? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1301.833s">Is</a>  that you with your hand in the air?</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1305.18s">It</a>  is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1306.761s">I</a>  was thinking that one question might be specifically around what you were saying, the late bus tier. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1312.485s">Some</a>  districts do have two tiers of late buses, now realizing that's an additional cost, but they have a say like a 3.30 late bus and then maybe a 6.30 or a 6 o'clock late bus once activities after school, things of that nature are done. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1328.375s">So</a>  that might be an additional question to ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1330.717s">I</a>  think another thing that needs to be very clearly articulated <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1334.259s">is</a>  that the survey needs to be filled out for each individual student, not each individual family, especially if they have multiple at various schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1343.762s">I</a>  don't know if that was stated. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1345.403s">I</a>  also just spoke with our rep from Safe Routes to School. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1349.945s">She</a>  is going to ask if we can't have access to the raw data. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1355.667s">It</a>  is normally a report shared with the principal, but she will ask if we can have access to the raw data.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1364.386s">be</a>  great.</p>

    <p>[Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1366.447s">Member</a>  Reinfeld? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1368.708s">So</a>  I will note that Member Ruseau and several other members sat in on the Student Advisory Committee or Student Advisory Council meeting last week, and they raised some challenges with the busing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1381.652s">Some</a>  of it was around how it is implemented at the schools in terms of stopping points and lines and crowding, and some of it was around timing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1390.336s">Was</a>  this? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1394.127s">The</a>  high school high school.</p>

    <p>[Megan Fidler-Carey]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1395.328s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1396.329s">Yeah,</a>  so I would echo what member Ruseau said earlier that getting student feedback certainly at the high school level and I think the middle school level as well I think my question is, to what extent is this survey about the quality of the experiences of the services being provided versus the. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1415.896s">the,</a>  the, which services should be provided and are going to be used because, you know, the things that we keep hearing about, about overcrowding on the buses or lack of bus monitor or vaping on the middle school bus, those sorts of questions, as you say, distinguishing fact from fiction, how prevalent are these issues? <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1434.448s">I</a>  saw Megan's hand go up.</p>

    <p>[Megan Fidler-Carey]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1435.909s">So</a>  yeah, just because my, my only fear about asking for an evaluation of the, you know, the quality of the service would just be opening up a ramp. <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1446.021s">cave</a>  you know so that's that would be my worry and and and especially because we know why we have a explanation for why some of the things are not working well it's it's partly this driver shortage um you know and so if we didn't know and everything was working the way it was we were fully staffed everything was great and then people told us like no it's not exactly what we want i think that would be more valuable but like right now to say that the <a href="https://youtu.be/ICamVjB-gmE&t=1475.066s">the</a>  buses are overcrowded or the bus drivers are grumpy when we're in a position where we can't really address, we can't afford to fire anybody.</p>
