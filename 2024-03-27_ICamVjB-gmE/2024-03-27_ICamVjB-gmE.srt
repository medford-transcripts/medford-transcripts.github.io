1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:02,371
[SPEAKER_06]: elect to do something different anyway.

2
00:00:04,252 --> 00:00:06,233
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's an important question.

3
00:00:06,253 --> 00:00:14,219
[SPEAKER_06]: The answer to what really is the, you know, what really is the perspective and opinion of those impacted is something that's sort of on my mind.

4
00:00:14,899 --> 00:00:19,303
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I think along the way, we hear lots of questions about like,

5
00:00:21,078 --> 00:00:25,620
[SPEAKER_06]: the policies around how far we will bus.

6
00:00:26,461 --> 00:00:35,546
[SPEAKER_06]: I drive by the high school somewhat regularly at about the time kids are already supposed to be in class and there's still like an endless stream of cars dropping kids off.

7
00:00:35,626 --> 00:00:44,731
[SPEAKER_06]: And I do wonder how anybody gets to school on time because the number of cars going in and out, you know, clearly dropping people off is pretty staggering.

8
00:00:46,472 --> 00:00:49,673
[SPEAKER_06]: which suggests that we're not providing transportation in some capacity.

9
00:00:50,494 --> 00:01:02,138
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think the goal is just for us to think about what kind of survey we could provide that would help us start to get some answers grounded in the people who use the services.

10
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:15,812
[SPEAKER_06]: to really think about what are the problems, whether they're solved by a new contract or they're more immediately solvable, and how do we have some facts to move forward with?

11
00:01:15,872 --> 00:01:20,056
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was the goal of this whole effort to begin with.

12
00:01:20,196 --> 00:01:30,325
[SPEAKER_06]: But I did see earlier today that the district launched a Smart Routes to School survey, and I was curious if anybody could tell us about that and

13
00:01:31,105 --> 00:01:40,890
[SPEAKER_06]: what it's what the questions are and who gets the data and what the goals are because I think that does complicate anything we're going to do here like we can't.

14
00:01:41,957 --> 00:01:48,742
[SPEAKER_06]: put out to transportation surveys in hot succession and expect that people are not going to be confused by that.

15
00:01:48,802 --> 00:01:54,565
[SPEAKER_06]: So when we ultimately get to talking about what goes in the survey and timing, I think that'll be important.

16
00:01:54,585 --> 00:02:00,449
[SPEAKER_06]: So I didn't know if anybody could tell us a little bit about what that survey is even all about that went out today.

17
00:02:00,649 --> 00:02:05,653
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Cushing, are you able to respond to member Graham's question?

18
00:02:06,613 --> 00:02:07,874
[SPEAKER_02]: He has been involved with

19
00:02:09,315 --> 00:02:10,256
[SPEAKER_02]: safe routes to school.

20
00:02:10,836 --> 00:02:15,298
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me just try calling him to jump back on.

21
00:02:15,398 --> 00:02:15,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

22
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,642
[SPEAKER_05]: And if he can't, my wife has been involved with this group, so I can speak to it.

23
00:02:22,682 --> 00:02:27,584
[SPEAKER_05]: And I spoke with Ellery as well, but I'd love to hear where the district is coming from on this.

24
00:02:27,724 --> 00:02:29,645
[SPEAKER_05]: But it is a three question survey.

25
00:02:29,805 --> 00:02:31,046
[SPEAKER_05]: I can pull it up, actually.

26
00:02:31,066 --> 00:02:31,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, OK.

27
00:02:32,367 --> 00:02:35,708
[SPEAKER_06]: I literally just saw it as I was signing in and I was like, yeah, I

28
00:02:37,089 --> 00:02:43,554
[SPEAKER_05]: I had reached out to the Safe Routes to Schools people to say, hey, is there anything you'd want us to keep in mind?

29
00:02:43,574 --> 00:02:48,638
[SPEAKER_05]: And they said, oh, actually, this thing that has been kind of chugging along slowly is set to launch tomorrow.

30
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:51,441
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was, yeah.

31
00:02:51,641 --> 00:02:52,481
[SPEAKER_05]: So the

32
00:02:54,025 --> 00:03:02,370
[SPEAKER_05]: The survey itself is run by Safe Routes to Schools, which is a statewide group that does local advocacy and assessments.

33
00:03:03,351 --> 00:03:07,173
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is a very basic survey, right?

34
00:03:07,313 --> 00:03:17,819
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you click on where you live, whoops, and then you answer questions about your child.

35
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:18,920
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you get to school?

36
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,020
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you get from school?

37
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:21,661
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is it.

38
00:03:23,174 --> 00:03:24,575
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not comprehensive.

39
00:03:24,635 --> 00:03:36,121
[SPEAKER_05]: I know this group is interested in getting more data about what stops people from active transportation, walking, biking, rolling this.

40
00:03:36,201 --> 00:03:38,423
[SPEAKER_05]: But this survey is just this assessment.

41
00:03:38,483 --> 00:03:44,106
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe it goes to the state organization of Safe Routes to Schools.

42
00:03:44,146 --> 00:03:48,548
[SPEAKER_05]: They do the data and provide a report.

43
00:03:52,748 --> 00:03:54,850
[SPEAKER_05]: I have the report from the Roberts from 2018.

44
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:59,434
[SPEAKER_05]: It used to be done by school, and I think they're pretty excited.

45
00:03:59,454 --> 00:04:10,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, Kitty, about having a comprehensive approach from the district on this, but it's really focusing on alternative transportation.

46
00:04:10,103 --> 00:04:12,685
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, that is super helpful.

47
00:04:12,705 --> 00:04:14,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Member Reinfeld.

48
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:19,811
[SPEAKER_06]: So I thought what we could do today is use the time that we have to start to

49
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:29,342
[SPEAKER_06]: brainstorm and think about, like, sort of the questions that we have that we would want to have vetted by this survey.

50
00:04:30,222 --> 00:04:33,883
[SPEAKER_06]: And to the extent that we can, you know, craft any questions that we have.

51
00:04:33,923 --> 00:04:42,645
[SPEAKER_06]: And then perhaps Megan and I can work offline to sort of flesh out a draft to bring back to this group at a future meeting.

52
00:04:44,405 --> 00:05:00,675
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I have a literal blank piece of paper here that I'm happy to share and we can walk through and just do some brainstorming until it can sort of evolve into something a little bit more formalized, if that works for the group, yeah?

53
00:05:02,356 --> 00:05:05,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I'm gonna share my screen.

54
00:05:11,002 --> 00:05:12,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, you all see my screen?

55
00:05:14,059 --> 00:05:14,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

56
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:18,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

57
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:30,163
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so I think, you know, sort of one thing that we probably want to be clear about is our questions to answer via the survey.

58
00:05:32,103 --> 00:05:39,425
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the other thing is, you know, what survey questions are we thinking we'll ask?

59
00:05:42,354 --> 00:05:44,736
[SPEAKER_06]: My typing always goes downhill when I'm sharing my screen.

60
00:05:52,402 --> 00:05:52,562
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

61
00:05:54,564 --> 00:06:06,413
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would be happy to hear from any of you if you, I have some thoughts, but I will yield my thoughts to the group if anybody has anything they want to throw out there.

62
00:06:12,628 --> 00:06:18,833
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did just Google for some examples of transportation surveys for school districts.

63
00:06:21,035 --> 00:06:25,018
[SPEAKER_00]: This one has 21 questions, which I am just reading right now.

64
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:35,747
[SPEAKER_00]: There are questions about the bell schedule, which is interesting to have as part of that survey.

65
00:06:35,767 --> 00:06:39,350
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't see the answers because the dropdowns have

66
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:47,252
[SPEAKER_00]: presumably lots of options, but it is a survey that is closed, so they won't let you drop down and see what's behind there.

67
00:06:49,353 --> 00:06:58,437
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's questions about the, you know, transportation experience, positives, surprising, that kind of stuff.

68
00:07:00,898 --> 00:07:03,559
[SPEAKER_00]: I also put into the chat the safe routes to schools

69
00:07:05,388 --> 00:07:10,172
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe this is a sample of what their actual report looks like.

70
00:07:13,154 --> 00:07:19,178
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does have, as Member Reinfeld pointed out, it's very basic.

71
00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:31,408
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when people are using it is sort of what I'm getting at, getting is how do people get to school, percentages, days of the week, the morning and the afternoon.

72
00:07:36,307 --> 00:07:40,652
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, they have a thing about weather conditions, which is good.

73
00:07:41,573 --> 00:07:50,503
[SPEAKER_00]: If we plan everything around, everybody bikes and the entire system falls apart because it isn't always biking weather, for instance, that could be a problem.

74
00:07:58,114 --> 00:07:58,294
[SPEAKER_05]: question.

75
00:07:58,314 --> 00:07:58,934
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I'm right, though.

76
00:07:59,254 --> 00:08:04,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes one meta question I have is whether we're looking to have an assessment and understand.

77
00:08:05,656 --> 00:08:15,038
[SPEAKER_05]: The what are the obstacles to participating in district provided transportation or alternative methods versus what could the district do differently?

78
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:20,120
[SPEAKER_05]: That would shift your transportation behavior because those are kind of two different approaches to

79
00:08:24,978 --> 00:08:25,618
[SPEAKER_06]: good question.

80
00:08:25,678 --> 00:08:44,642
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think the other thing on my mind is we need to, I think in terms of like how we get responses, we need to know like at baseline, each person who's answering the survey, how did they get to school today?

81
00:08:44,662 --> 00:08:44,723
[SPEAKER_06]: And

82
00:08:48,001 --> 00:08:50,062
[SPEAKER_06]: does that meet their needs?

83
00:08:50,202 --> 00:08:56,665
[SPEAKER_06]: And if it doesn't, what is it that they would identify as the thing that would meet their needs?

84
00:08:56,745 --> 00:09:07,771
[SPEAKER_06]: So as an example, my ninth grader walks to school and that meets my needs because we live less than a half a mile from the high school.

85
00:09:09,002 --> 00:09:18,406
[SPEAKER_06]: I might feel differently if my ninth grader walked to school, but we live two miles from the high school, which technically means she's supposed to walk to school.

86
00:09:19,087 --> 00:09:24,049
[SPEAKER_06]: And I might say in that case, like I, my kid walks to school, but it does not meet my needs.

87
00:09:24,329 --> 00:09:29,811
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would like the district to provide transportation so that she doesn't have to walk two miles to school.

88
00:09:30,011 --> 00:09:30,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

89
00:09:30,632 --> 00:09:37,555
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think like understanding sort of how, how it works today for the respondents and

90
00:09:38,928 --> 00:09:50,035
[SPEAKER_06]: whether that meets their needs or not, and if it doesn't, like what would, I think is an important way to think about how we want to drive out these questions.

91
00:09:52,536 --> 00:10:08,066
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it maybe is both of those things, member Reinfeld, like maybe it is like, is it that I need the district to do something different or I need to do something different, like what, you know, is it that,

92
00:10:09,312 --> 00:10:18,520
[SPEAKER_06]: there's some barrier that's not allowing me to do the thing that I want to do, or is it simply like, I need a yellow bus to come pick up my kid in order for me to say that this meets my needs?

93
00:10:19,982 --> 00:10:22,644
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think we're going to get a whole bunch of different answers.

94
00:10:22,704 --> 00:10:32,533
[SPEAKER_06]: But when it relates to students, the high school students in particular, I think one question I would want to dial in on is, if they are

95
00:10:34,202 --> 00:10:37,043
[SPEAKER_06]: using a bus to get to school today, what kind of bus are they using?

96
00:10:37,423 --> 00:10:39,483
[SPEAKER_06]: And like, does that meet their needs?

97
00:10:39,603 --> 00:10:41,003
[SPEAKER_06]: And if it doesn't, what would?

98
00:10:41,984 --> 00:10:53,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Which might help us understand like the MBTA question around like, what are the preferences of the students riding and their families for that matter?

99
00:10:58,067 --> 00:10:58,787
[SPEAKER_06]: So that we can

100
00:11:02,999 --> 00:11:06,182
[SPEAKER_06]: respond accordingly, you know, and consider like what that means for us.

101
00:11:10,085 --> 00:11:12,186
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to share this document.

102
00:11:12,287 --> 00:11:16,190
[SPEAKER_00]: So is this being created in your personal Gmail or in school?

103
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,130
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, just check.

104
00:11:17,591 --> 00:11:17,811
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.

105
00:11:20,993 --> 00:11:21,514
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate that.

106
00:11:24,977 --> 00:11:26,478
[SPEAKER_00]: I also, I think that

107
00:11:27,305 --> 00:11:36,548
[SPEAKER_00]: As you were just speaking, I was wondering about whether or not, you know, looking at the survey, Safe Routes to School survey, this appears to be a survey to parents.

108
00:11:40,289 --> 00:11:45,250
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's an important group to ask.

109
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:55,053
[SPEAKER_00]: We have questions for parents, caregivers, but I feel like there needs to be questions

110
00:11:55,859 --> 00:12:00,702
[SPEAKER_00]: to the users, the students, as well, especially for the high school.

111
00:12:01,723 --> 00:12:06,466
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like they're very different kinds of questions.

112
00:12:08,688 --> 00:12:08,988
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it is.

113
00:12:09,248 --> 00:12:09,548
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

114
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:10,549
[SPEAKER_00]: And high school students.

115
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:11,470
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Tom.

116
00:12:13,071 --> 00:12:13,351
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.

117
00:12:17,313 --> 00:12:21,456
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, looking at their data, though, I'm frankly nervous.

118
00:12:21,756 --> 00:12:22,537
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they have

119
00:12:23,675 --> 00:12:34,842
[SPEAKER_00]: Each day, the morning and the afternoon, transportation, the data broken up by each of those, which is 10 different things, which of course makes sense to want that.

120
00:12:36,182 --> 00:12:45,408
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of data and I'm hopeful we don't have to replicate anything that we have coming out of Safe Routes to School survey.

121
00:12:45,428 --> 00:12:52,192
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we can scratch it off the list instead of asking those questions again.

122
00:12:53,576 --> 00:12:54,737
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm not convinced.

123
00:12:54,757 --> 00:13:01,023
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, first of all, I'm not convinced that we would even have access to that data in a raw form, right?

124
00:13:01,103 --> 00:13:08,971
[SPEAKER_06]: Like this is, I mean, I suppose we could ask for it, but more than likely we're going to get a report, right?

125
00:13:09,051 --> 00:13:17,920
[SPEAKER_06]: That provides, I think we're going to have to ask some, maybe some questions more than, you know, again, because I think we would want to be able to attribute them

126
00:13:20,137 --> 00:13:25,860
[SPEAKER_06]: within our own data set, right?

127
00:13:26,841 --> 00:13:28,842
[SPEAKER_06]: And Megan, I'm so glad that you're able to join us.

128
00:13:29,002 --> 00:13:47,292
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that you and I have talked about this a few times like over the course of time, but I'm curious, you know, based on what your office feels in terms of questions about transportation, like what's on your mind as we think about like what people, what information we need to get from people?

129
00:13:54,073 --> 00:13:54,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you can't unmute.

130
00:13:56,176 --> 00:13:56,496
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on.

131
00:13:57,057 --> 00:13:58,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there we go.

132
00:13:59,099 --> 00:14:00,040
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.

133
00:14:00,461 --> 00:14:01,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, there we go.

134
00:14:01,982 --> 00:14:04,245
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so I mean we certainly

135
00:14:05,868 --> 00:14:13,656
[SPEAKER_03]: So I am right in the middle of it because I know what can be done with the resources as they exist and then what the policies say.

136
00:14:13,736 --> 00:14:26,228
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we were to change some of the policies to meet some of the unmet demands of the families, we wouldn't be able to meet those policy demands now because we don't have the infrastructure for it.

137
00:14:26,268 --> 00:14:28,850
[SPEAKER_03]: So this bus driver shortage thing is so real.

138
00:14:29,511 --> 00:14:37,053
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I'm with you, Jenny, that like, the hardest part was we cracked down a little bit on the policy distances.

139
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:44,375
[SPEAKER_03]: And we got rid of some bus stops that were, especially at the elementary school level, we got rid of some bus stops that were inside the one mile mark.

140
00:14:44,715 --> 00:14:47,816
[SPEAKER_03]: So we weren't obligated by policy to bus those students.

141
00:14:48,356 --> 00:14:54,737
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the families just, you know, they got savvy, and they just walked up to the next bus stop, and it was like, 30 kids.

142
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:56,598
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know,

143
00:14:57,116 --> 00:15:10,826
[SPEAKER_03]: I was preparing myself to crack down on those 30 kids, but I was thinking specifically about which families they were, what neighborhood they come from, and what the sort of PR fallout of having such a huge group all at once would be.

144
00:15:11,667 --> 00:15:21,373
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, I know that that's a lot of kind of anecdotal parts of the details, but it's an important part for this group to be thinking about.

145
00:15:22,394 --> 00:15:26,037
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that what I would see a lot of is to rethink those,

146
00:15:26,547 --> 00:15:28,763
[SPEAKER_03]: policies because they are too far.

147
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:42,909
[SPEAKER_03]: And we as a district, and I'm committed to doing this this summer, need to also commit to kind of rebuilding community to talk to them about how to not be super scared of walking to school.

148
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:57,000
[SPEAKER_03]: So luckily, the new manager at Eastern Bus and I, we have just a sort of plan in place for this summer that we're going to, she's going to, we're going to drive all the routes together and she's going to make them more efficient and we're going to make them

149
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:03,103
[SPEAKER_03]: to policy so that we're not, you know, taking too many kids that are not eligible.

150
00:16:03,944 --> 00:16:14,249
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to reach out and talk to families in the in the neighborhoods that have historically been kind of like getting on the bus, but they're not eligible to and offer meetups.

151
00:16:14,449 --> 00:16:20,673
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to work with the Met Family Network where it's appropriate to offer meetups to be like, let's all walk to school together.

152
00:16:20,753 --> 00:16:21,453
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is where

153
00:16:22,974 --> 00:16:24,896
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to, you know, work with Ellery.

154
00:16:24,976 --> 00:16:31,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Ellery reached out to me and I haven't had a chance to get back to her about Safe Routes to School, to find out what resources we have to do this.

155
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:37,948
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sort of a teaching people how to walk to school, which sounds funny that we need to be so explicit about it, but we do.

156
00:16:38,829 --> 00:16:45,975
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, sort of introducing people like this is who you would walk with, and it's okay, you can trust your kids with these people to walk to school.

157
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:49,468
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

158
00:16:49,488 --> 00:16:55,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are a lot of anecdotal stories, but that's what I'm constantly working between.

159
00:16:55,889 --> 00:17:01,711
[SPEAKER_03]: The push of families saying, it's too far for my kids to walk, so I need a seat on the bus.

160
00:17:02,491 --> 00:17:05,411
[SPEAKER_03]: And the bus is all being overcrowded because there's a driver shortage.

161
00:17:05,451 --> 00:17:10,152
[SPEAKER_03]: So even students that are eligible, there aren't enough seats, and so the bus has become unsafe.

162
00:17:11,433 --> 00:17:16,754
[SPEAKER_03]: And the pushback that I want to give to say, we need to build some independence in the kids and start walking with them.

163
00:17:19,096 --> 00:17:20,357
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's where we are with that.

164
00:17:20,897 --> 00:17:28,540
[SPEAKER_03]: But as far as at the high school level, adding yellow buses at the high school, I've just done informal surveys with those students.

165
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:34,222
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to see a formal survey with actual student voice to find out how they feel about that.

166
00:17:34,302 --> 00:17:45,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think that if we went to the expense of adding the yellow buses for all of the high school students that are eligible for them, we would have a lot of empty buses.

167
00:17:46,367 --> 00:17:48,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Lucy, I'm sorry, I'm on a Zoom call.

168
00:17:50,316 --> 00:17:56,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we would have a lot of yellow buses that were, you know, barely full, and it would be very expensive.

169
00:17:57,022 --> 00:18:12,335
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, I did the math once and said that it would be cheaper for us to give to pay for all of the MBTA M cards for every student in the high school than it would be to have the 14 required yellow buses to take bus every kid.

170
00:18:15,218 --> 00:18:15,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Now,

171
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:20,485
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I don't know how many of the kids would use those so that would be a waste.

172
00:18:20,865 --> 00:18:29,709
[SPEAKER_03]: The other part about this is what a waste of money it feels like because when we were paying for MBTA buses for students, we could tell that a lot of them weren't even using them.

173
00:18:29,749 --> 00:18:39,473
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were spending $30 on a month for students for the just in case one day a week that they might use it but otherwise they were getting a ride from their friends or they're driving themselves or they were getting it from their parents.

174
00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:45,770
[SPEAKER_03]: So that didn't, that was just painful to watch all that money kind of fly out the window.

175
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:50,171
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that the high school survey would be very valuable, very interesting to see.

176
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:59,133
[SPEAKER_03]: And their parents, you know, because we just got an email today from a parent saying that she's very uncomfortable with her student driving in cars with friends and that he does take the yellow bus.

177
00:18:59,193 --> 00:19:02,614
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think the parent's voice needs to be in that survey as well.

178
00:19:03,154 --> 00:19:04,614
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

179
00:19:05,214 --> 00:19:07,575
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Megan, I know the,

180
00:19:09,141 --> 00:19:13,364
[SPEAKER_06]: the questions or the concerns probably are different at different levels, right?

181
00:19:13,404 --> 00:19:22,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Like at elementary, I would expect to see lots of different kinds of feedback than at middle school and at high school.

182
00:19:27,153 --> 00:19:36,719
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm curious if there are other questions, like what else do we want to know about in terms of our bus

183
00:19:39,807 --> 00:19:45,229
[SPEAKER_06]: ridership, I guess I'll say, or transportation that we haven't talked about so far.

184
00:19:45,909 --> 00:19:49,711
[SPEAKER_06]: And one thing that comes to mind is like some explicit questions about late busing.

185
00:19:50,711 --> 00:19:58,554
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I know, you know, over the years, that's even been a question at the elementary school level, like there have been a handful of instances where we've provided

186
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:09,512
[SPEAKER_06]: yellow late buses to programs at the elementary school, although it always struck me as like a one-off thing that was sort of happening.

187
00:20:09,532 --> 00:20:19,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the only one I know about that was when we had ESSER funding and we were doing sort of tutoring, like ESSER, the catch-up

188
00:20:19,673 --> 00:20:21,574
[SPEAKER_03]: catch up tutoring for elementary school.

189
00:20:21,634 --> 00:20:23,474
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we provided transportation for that.

190
00:20:23,554 --> 00:20:24,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, right.

191
00:20:24,995 --> 00:20:32,338
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, but I think late busing in general is a question that we should probably try to get the answer to.

192
00:20:32,518 --> 00:20:37,039
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I've heard like, and I sort of wondered about this for forever.

193
00:20:37,379 --> 00:20:41,481
[SPEAKER_06]: My middle schooler does afterschool sports.

194
00:20:41,921 --> 00:20:42,941
[SPEAKER_06]: They're very scheduled.

195
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:44,262
[SPEAKER_06]: They're totally predictable.

196
00:20:44,462 --> 00:20:46,843
[SPEAKER_06]: They start after the late bus leaves the middle school.

197
00:20:47,891 --> 00:21:01,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, it feels a little bit insane that we would have a school sponsored activity and we would intentionally started after transportation options exist for the kids.

198
00:21:01,903 --> 00:21:05,326
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's, you know, I think when I think of the late bus, I think of that.

199
00:21:06,447 --> 00:21:10,388
[SPEAKER_06]: Like my kids, because when they're in middle school, they ride past the high school.

200
00:21:11,048 --> 00:21:18,350
[SPEAKER_06]: They report about overcrowding on days where there's middle school athletes going from the middle school to the high school.

201
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:25,051
[SPEAKER_06]: I hear the same thing about the library, which is a hot spot for middle school dating, which always makes me giggle.

202
00:21:27,893 --> 00:21:36,766
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's like sort of hot spots around the city that, you know, sort of flare up at different times of the day that I think are worth sort of pursuing as well.

203
00:21:38,028 --> 00:21:41,793
[SPEAKER_06]: And this, I see somebody from, is that Peter?

204
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:42,815
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that you with your hand in the air?

205
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:45,480
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.

206
00:21:46,761 --> 00:21:52,265
[SPEAKER_01]: I was thinking that one question might be specifically around what you were saying, the late bus tier.

207
00:21:52,485 --> 00:22:07,115
[SPEAKER_01]: Some districts do have two tiers of late buses, now realizing that's an additional cost, but they have a say like a 3.30 late bus and then maybe a 6.30 or a 6 o'clock late bus once activities after school, things of that nature are done.

208
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:10,537
[SPEAKER_01]: So that might be an additional question to ask.

209
00:22:10,717 --> 00:22:13,619
[SPEAKER_01]: I think another thing that needs to be very clearly articulated

210
00:22:14,259 --> 00:22:23,742
[SPEAKER_01]: is that the survey needs to be filled out for each individual student, not each individual family, especially if they have multiple at various schools.

211
00:22:23,762 --> 00:22:24,903
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if that was stated.

212
00:22:25,403 --> 00:22:29,064
[SPEAKER_01]: I also just spoke with our rep from Safe Routes to School.

213
00:22:29,945 --> 00:22:35,587
[SPEAKER_01]: She is going to ask if we can't have access to the raw data.

214
00:22:35,667 --> 00:22:41,209
[SPEAKER_01]: It is normally a report shared with the principal, but she will ask if we can have access to the raw data.

215
00:22:44,386 --> 00:22:44,826
[SPEAKER_00]: be great.

216
00:22:46,447 --> 00:22:48,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Reinfeld?

217
00:22:48,708 --> 00:23:01,612
[SPEAKER_05]: So I will note that Member Ruseau and several other members sat in on the Student Advisory Committee or Student Advisory Council meeting last week, and they raised some challenges with the busing.

218
00:23:01,652 --> 00:23:10,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of it was around how it is implemented at the schools in terms of stopping points and lines and crowding, and some of it was around timing.

219
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:12,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Was this?

220
00:23:14,127 --> 00:23:15,308
[SPEAKER_05]: The high school high school.

221
00:23:15,328 --> 00:23:15,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

222
00:23:16,329 --> 00:23:33,566
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so I would echo what member Ruseau said earlier that getting student feedback certainly at the high school level and I think the middle school level as well I think my question is, to what extent is this survey about the quality of the experiences of the services being provided versus the.

223
00:23:35,896 --> 00:23:53,648
[SPEAKER_05]: the, the, which services should be provided and are going to be used because, you know, the things that we keep hearing about, about overcrowding on the buses or lack of bus monitor or vaping on the middle school bus, those sorts of questions, as you say, distinguishing fact from fiction, how prevalent are these issues?

224
00:23:54,448 --> 00:23:55,769
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw Megan's hand go up.

225
00:23:55,909 --> 00:24:04,435
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, just because my, my only fear about asking for an evaluation of the, you know, the quality of the service would just be opening up a ramp.

226
00:24:06,021 --> 00:24:34,217
[SPEAKER_03]: cave you know so that's that would be my worry and and and especially because we know why we have a explanation for why some of the things are not working well it's it's partly this driver shortage um you know and so if we didn't know and everything was working the way it was we were fully staffed everything was great and then people told us like no it's not exactly what we want i think that would be more valuable but like right now to say that the

227
00:24:35,066 --> 00:24:44,628
[SPEAKER_03]: the buses are overcrowded or the bus drivers are grumpy when we're in a position where we can't really address, we can't afford to fire anybody.

228
00:24:44,648 --> 00:24:54,869
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean- I think my question there is to, is it, can we phrase those things in terms of obstacles?

229
00:24:54,949 --> 00:25:01,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Are people not putting their kids on the bus because of X, Y, or Z reasons?

230
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:04,091
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that phrasing is useful.

231
00:25:05,026 --> 00:25:05,566
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Ruseau?

232
00:25:06,487 --> 00:25:10,108
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I think, I certainly understand Megan's concern.

233
00:25:10,628 --> 00:25:13,370
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody really wants a report that says, my God, everything's terrible.

234
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:24,714
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially when we, first of all, I'm not saying everything is terrible, but when we know there are problems and we know what they are and we know the solution, and right now that is not solvable.

235
00:25:25,875 --> 00:25:32,798
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think there's value, however, in understanding it because it provides us with a priority list.

236
00:25:33,814 --> 00:25:54,420
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when we decide how to spend money, which we don't have enough of, I think knowing, you know, if 92% of all students who ride our transportation think it's the worst thing that they've ever experienced in their lives, that's different than 20% complaining.

237
00:25:55,140 --> 00:26:01,462
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll help us understand in the context of other services in the district that we don't provide or can't provide

238
00:26:02,924 --> 00:26:05,486
[SPEAKER_00]: might be cutting or whatever else.

239
00:26:06,807 --> 00:26:27,905
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think one thing about the survey in general that worries me is, like other surveys we have done, such as our superintendent search, which is the one that is most prevalent in my mind, because I did the survey, not alone, but

240
00:26:29,787 --> 00:26:33,251
[SPEAKER_00]: is we really struggle with outreach is an understatement.

241
00:26:33,852 --> 00:26:44,745
[SPEAKER_00]: The people that responded to the superintendent's search to say they were not a slice of Medford, a representative slice of Medford is the biggest understatement I could possibly ever say.

242
00:26:45,506 --> 00:26:49,891
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, I mean, I appreciated all of their feedback and we got a very good number.

243
00:26:50,492 --> 00:26:54,474
[SPEAKER_00]: but like the number one income level for people that responded was over $250,000.

244
00:26:54,695 --> 00:26:58,597
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is not the average of Medford.

245
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:15,627
[SPEAKER_00]: So I worry about how we can get a meaningful set of responses so that we are, first of all, not skewing the data so much into just people with a grudge, which is always a concern.

246
00:27:18,317 --> 00:27:26,783
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also, you know, the late school bus stuff that was just brought up, you know, I don't know how many times I can tell my story, but some of the faces on the screen changed.

247
00:27:26,843 --> 00:27:30,325
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but, you know, I lived in a rural district.

248
00:27:30,806 --> 00:27:35,709
[SPEAKER_00]: I was the furthest student from the school, the furthest student.

249
00:27:36,189 --> 00:27:42,074
[SPEAKER_00]: And to say it was well over an hour each way every day was no exaggeration.

250
00:27:42,354 --> 00:27:43,535
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were no late buses.

251
00:27:44,352 --> 00:27:53,097
[SPEAKER_00]: at all, and I participated in exactly zero after-school activities my entire 7 through 12 education, because it was a 7 through 12 high school.

252
00:27:53,717 --> 00:28:06,885
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think, you know, certainly my strong preference is that we prioritize stuff like that, because now, granted, this is not rural New Hampshire with 13 towns going to one school far, far away.

253
00:28:06,905 --> 00:28:12,188
[SPEAKER_00]: It is definitely a different situation, and there might be alternatives.

254
00:28:14,324 --> 00:28:20,487
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm just very sensitive to our students not participating in activities because transportation is the reason they can't.

255
00:28:21,427 --> 00:28:29,230
[SPEAKER_00]: And how we get at those students and get those answers, I don't know.

256
00:28:30,091 --> 00:28:40,235
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that should definitely be a priority because they're the people who are not necessarily getting served at all.

257
00:28:41,877 --> 00:28:44,779
[SPEAKER_05]: May I share a map of our school radiuses?

258
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:46,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

259
00:28:47,021 --> 00:28:49,162
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

260
00:28:50,563 --> 00:28:52,144
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are our schools.

261
00:28:54,226 --> 00:28:55,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my toolbar's in the way.

262
00:28:55,947 --> 00:28:56,407
[SPEAKER_05]: There it goes.

263
00:28:57,228 --> 00:28:57,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

264
00:28:57,568 --> 00:29:00,670
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this is within half a mile.

265
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:04,493
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the lighter shading is one mile.

266
00:29:06,007 --> 00:29:08,530
[SPEAKER_05]: And then these dotted lines are the three miles.

267
00:29:09,031 --> 00:29:20,464
[SPEAKER_05]: So, particularly when we're looking right Fulton Heights I know we do a bus at the high school here, but we've also got a lot of outside the radius for the high school and a lot of these neighborhoods.

268
00:29:22,126 --> 00:29:37,541
[SPEAKER_05]: are a particular demographic and so there's a there's a huge equity issue and understanding I love Megan's idea of reaching out specifically to families right the elementary schools have this have these radii but even some of that is not being

269
00:29:38,618 --> 00:29:40,160
[SPEAKER_05]: captured in this.

270
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:45,806
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's also, I think, the stigma issue that needs to be talked about, right?

271
00:29:45,886 --> 00:29:49,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Riding a bus, the kids who are able to park.

272
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:51,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Is parking free for high school students?

273
00:29:52,353 --> 00:29:52,553
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

274
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:57,933
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, but that, of course, requires owning a car or having access to a car.

275
00:29:58,874 --> 00:30:02,417
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I don't know to what extent stigma is informing.

276
00:30:02,517 --> 00:30:07,001
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we can ask about how would your behavior change if we made these changes?

277
00:30:07,782 --> 00:30:09,063
[SPEAKER_05]: But some of it is not.

278
00:30:09,584 --> 00:30:14,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of it is really rooted in, you know what, even if you give me these buses, I wouldn't take them.

279
00:30:16,204 --> 00:30:27,627
[SPEAKER_05]: or even if I knew how to walk to school, I wouldn't, or my family, my parent drives past the school every day, and so they drop me off, and I'm never gonna switch to something else.

280
00:30:28,607 --> 00:30:37,889
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we're hoping to accomplish, is there an ideal situation that we want to achieve here, or is it just, you know,

281
00:30:38,989 --> 00:30:50,079
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think in my mind, if we can craft the questions correctly, like we can ask people about what they do today and is it.

282
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:52,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it their preference?

283
00:30:52,497 --> 00:30:54,459
[SPEAKER_06]: And if it's not, why not?

284
00:30:55,239 --> 00:31:07,808
[SPEAKER_06]: So that we can acknowledge that not everybody has the same, my mom drives by the high school every day and she's gonna drop me off and that's my preferred way to get there, right?

285
00:31:08,108 --> 00:31:17,055
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm fine with that and if you sent a yellow bus to my driveway, I wouldn't take it because I'm gonna get in my mom's car and she's gonna drop me off, right?

286
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:18,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Versus like,

287
00:31:20,049 --> 00:31:22,571
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have a parent that can drop me off.

288
00:31:22,772 --> 00:31:24,373
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I walk a mile to school every day.

289
00:31:24,433 --> 00:31:25,994
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I think those are different things.

290
00:31:26,875 --> 00:31:45,272
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think individually, like, right, it's impossible to make everybody happy, but I think if you can get enough response to the survey, so back to outreach, if you can get enough response to the survey, you can see trend and you can see like sort of global preferences, right?

291
00:31:47,952 --> 00:31:52,443
[SPEAKER_06]: and that data might be useful in order for us to be able to say.

292
00:31:54,468 --> 00:32:00,452
[SPEAKER_06]: you know what, like the high school kids have no issues at all with the MBTA buses bringing them to and from school.

293
00:32:00,572 --> 00:32:01,933
[SPEAKER_06]: What they care about is that they're late.

294
00:32:02,313 --> 00:32:08,477
[SPEAKER_06]: For example, like maybe they care, maybe they don't care what the bus looks like, but they care that they can get to school on time, right?

295
00:32:08,857 --> 00:32:13,660
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I'm fine with the, I'm fine with the MBTA, but it makes me late every day.

296
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:17,583
[SPEAKER_05]: And that- And that was, that was actually their complaint that there are two buses and they're crowded.

297
00:32:18,246 --> 00:32:18,486
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

298
00:32:19,027 --> 00:32:28,915
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think there's like a lot of different like, you know, when you talk about like what works for people, like what works for people works for them and not necessarily for anybody else.

299
00:32:29,015 --> 00:32:37,702
[SPEAKER_06]: But I mean, there is a finite number of versions of what exists versus what we would like it to be.

300
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:42,806
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think we could see if we can get enough participation, like I think we could see

301
00:32:44,691 --> 00:32:53,813
[SPEAKER_06]: something that informs like, are we trying to expand the number of buses we have and by how many, for example, or by none?

302
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:56,673
[SPEAKER_06]: Like maybe the survey says like none is the right answer.

303
00:32:56,693 --> 00:32:57,853
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

304
00:32:58,493 --> 00:32:59,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Peter, did you have your hand in the air?

305
00:33:01,694 --> 00:33:02,274
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I do.

306
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:03,214
[SPEAKER_01]: Quick question.

307
00:33:03,254 --> 00:33:09,375
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Reinfeld, what year, I wasn't able to see, what year was that data from on those radii?

308
00:33:10,115 --> 00:33:12,096
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a great question.

309
00:33:12,136 --> 00:33:13,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me find it again.

310
00:33:14,829 --> 00:33:20,614
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only reason I ask is we are actually working with the city and safe routes to update those.

311
00:33:21,194 --> 00:33:24,136
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can provide as soon as we have it, I can provide them.

312
00:33:25,077 --> 00:33:30,701
[SPEAKER_01]: We've sent the addresses in with no identifying information to do that.

313
00:33:30,841 --> 00:33:32,563
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are working on that right now.

314
00:33:33,563 --> 00:33:43,251
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing too, just to consider when it comes to parking is, there may be a project, there will be a project in the next few years that may significantly limit

315
00:33:44,131 --> 00:33:54,896
[SPEAKER_01]: High school parking, and so it's just something as we're considering transportation moving forward, you know, the, the effects of reduced student parking, potentially in the future.

316
00:33:57,858 --> 00:34:01,380
[SPEAKER_00]: I was actually going to bring that up.

317
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:07,663
[SPEAKER_00]: Peter in a slightly different way, but, you know, aside from the.

318
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:16,763
[SPEAKER_00]: the probable need to have less parking available, assuming that the high school is done where it is now.

319
00:34:18,123 --> 00:34:25,987
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also the need to understand, if we are building a whole new high school, how much parking lot are we building?

320
00:34:26,627 --> 00:34:31,909
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't suspect the MSBA actually will have an answer for that in some formula.

321
00:34:32,309 --> 00:34:34,871
[SPEAKER_00]: But they may have a formula for minimums or something.

322
00:34:36,258 --> 00:34:42,723
[SPEAKER_00]: we probably have more than is normal just because of the lot we have right now.

323
00:34:42,843 --> 00:34:54,532
[SPEAKER_00]: So understanding if we end up having to have less parking, how much less can we have before it becomes a real problem?

324
00:34:58,234 --> 00:35:01,116
[SPEAKER_00]: Also the parking is for me is about the,

325
00:35:02,529 --> 00:35:10,493
[SPEAKER_00]: the ins and outs of the high school, getting your kid in and out for parents and for buses and for students that are driving.

326
00:35:13,174 --> 00:35:16,976
[SPEAKER_00]: The current setup is, of course, everybody can agree is terrible.

327
00:35:18,977 --> 00:35:26,040
[SPEAKER_00]: And whether or how much we think about and care about that in a new design,

328
00:35:27,794 --> 00:35:28,915
[SPEAKER_00]: it kind of matters.

329
00:35:29,155 --> 00:35:37,919
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if we were to change the pattern and make it work beautifully, would we suddenly have far more people driving their kids to school?

330
00:35:37,959 --> 00:35:40,060
[SPEAKER_00]: Would we have far more students trying to park?

331
00:35:42,061 --> 00:35:50,605
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, those, that kind of a change, if it was not so painful, I think there might be more people who are like, I'll just drop you off at school.

332
00:35:51,845 --> 00:35:55,767
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know that they're like on Wildwood across from the high school,

333
00:35:56,414 --> 00:35:59,197
[SPEAKER_00]: like people are lined up there early.

334
00:35:59,497 --> 00:36:01,019
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sometimes one of them.

335
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:05,963
[SPEAKER_00]: And we won't even go up to the high school because it's so awful.

336
00:36:07,405 --> 00:36:13,150
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, no understanding what people might want to do.

337
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:19,897
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I feel like there is two things here, the evaluation of what they have, but then there's sort of the blue sky

338
00:36:21,334 --> 00:36:29,057
[SPEAKER_00]: If let's pretend we were building a Medford High from scratch and we didn't have students and we were just creating a high school from the beginning, what would people want?

339
00:36:29,477 --> 00:36:34,879
[SPEAKER_00]: Which isn't necessarily what they would do, but I don't feel like we know that at all.

340
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,981
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the other thing that I hear about

341
00:36:44,605 --> 00:36:56,820
[SPEAKER_06]: often well and usually like at the beginning of the year is that there are times where our reliance on MBTA buses is like misaligned with what service they're going to provide right so like when we.

342
00:36:59,323 --> 00:37:02,968
[SPEAKER_06]: When we start school in August right like.

343
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,882
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, oh, we don't have service those days.

344
00:37:05,982 --> 00:37:08,163
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, guys, get yourselves to school some other way.

345
00:37:09,704 --> 00:37:23,434
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think the other sort of thing I'm interested, I think my other interest in doing the survey is to be able to present like a really full picture of transportation in the district and

346
00:37:25,399 --> 00:37:33,122
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, like dispel the fiction, right, wherever it exists and describe like what we do and why.

347
00:37:33,222 --> 00:37:47,307
[SPEAKER_06]: So for example, like I'm under the impression, I could be totally wrong, that we don't have, we don't have late start snow days because the MBTA buses aren't gonna get our kids to school if we put a two hour delay on.

348
00:37:47,667 --> 00:37:48,948
[SPEAKER_06]: I could be completely wrong about that.

349
00:37:48,968 --> 00:37:50,088
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no idea.

350
00:37:52,129 --> 00:37:53,090
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I've always heard.

351
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:59,354
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I tell people if they ask me, but we also like I think need to be able to.

352
00:38:03,526 --> 00:38:11,434
[SPEAKER_06]: sort of like lay out like, here's what we do transportation-wise and why, so that we own our story.

353
00:38:11,454 --> 00:38:22,343
[SPEAKER_06]: So like Megan, my sort of immediate reaction to you saying like, we know what the problems are, was my thought was like, I don't think anybody knows that you know what the problems are.

354
00:38:23,044 --> 00:38:26,367
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I don't think the community thinks that at all.

355
00:38:26,407 --> 00:38:29,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I don't think they think we have a handle on it at all.

356
00:38:31,191 --> 00:38:35,675
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is like, you know, Medford dies hard around being disorganized.

357
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:44,027
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think if we have answers to these questions, this is also an opportunity for us to say, here's what the data tells us about this survey.

358
00:38:44,327 --> 00:38:49,491
[SPEAKER_06]: And like, here's like a level set of what we do and why and like what we're already working on.

359
00:38:49,551 --> 00:38:53,075
[SPEAKER_06]: So like, I think you're working on lots of great things.

360
00:38:53,495 --> 00:38:55,117
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't think anybody knows about it.

361
00:38:55,977 --> 00:38:57,938
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's always a timing issue, right?

362
00:38:57,978 --> 00:39:01,359
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, when do you tell people that you're working on something?

363
00:39:01,379 --> 00:39:10,423
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think we have a lot of history around, like, misfiring on that timing question, you know, in all kinds of ways.

364
00:39:11,043 --> 00:39:15,545
[SPEAKER_06]: But this could be an opportunity for us to say, like, as we go forward, here's what we're looking at.

365
00:39:16,105 --> 00:39:20,147
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have a set of recommendations based on the data and our current practice.

366
00:39:20,267 --> 00:39:23,108
[SPEAKER_06]: And the recommendation is we're going to change the

367
00:39:24,088 --> 00:39:49,361
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, the one mile radius to one and a half miles, or we're going to change the two mile radius to one mile, like whatever those things are that we're going to decide out of this, like this is an opportunity for us to strategically say, like, this is the need, this is what we have, and this is where, this is like, this is what we think we should do over the next X years, and that's how we're going to go forward with a plan around, you know, all things transportation.

368
00:39:50,848 --> 00:40:06,297
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the other question I have is like how do we wrap in all the transportation like the individualized transportation that the district provides because I think that's an important aspect to all of this is to make sure we understand that piece of it too.

369
00:40:09,319 --> 00:40:29,205
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, what the set of questions are around that individualized transportation, whether it's to schools within our district or schools that are out of district, like what, you know, we have to sort of craft some questions about that as well for the impacted individuals who, who take that kind of transportation from the district.

370
00:40:30,525 --> 00:40:32,386
[SPEAKER_06]: Megan, did you have a question or a hand up?

371
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

372
00:40:40,421 --> 00:40:40,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, there we go.

373
00:40:41,001 --> 00:40:41,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

374
00:40:41,442 --> 00:40:46,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, no, I was, uh, let me go back and think if I can remember it.

375
00:40:47,385 --> 00:40:58,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, I, I would love to have the sort of place to sort of, I don't know if it's airing dirty laundry, but sort of give our reasons our stories.

376
00:41:00,933 --> 00:41:02,494
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, but like,

377
00:41:03,387 --> 00:41:07,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Because nobody likes to hear the answer of, well, there's a driver shortage.

378
00:41:07,868 --> 00:41:08,649
[SPEAKER_03]: It's unbelievable.

379
00:41:08,849 --> 00:41:10,189
[SPEAKER_03]: People are like, so what?

380
00:41:10,249 --> 00:41:10,929
[SPEAKER_03]: That's your problem.

381
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:11,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Make it happen.

382
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:13,750
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell the company that they've got to figure it out.

383
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:17,252
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, the company is working with us so closely.

384
00:41:17,672 --> 00:41:20,493
[SPEAKER_03]: And she calls me every time she's got a new person that they're training.

385
00:41:21,073 --> 00:41:24,134
[SPEAKER_03]: And she calls me every time that there's somebody that they had to let go for, like,

386
00:41:24,734 --> 00:41:26,494
[SPEAKER_03]: safety reasons that we all support.

387
00:41:27,535 --> 00:41:29,595
[SPEAKER_03]: But for strategic planning, I agree with you.

388
00:41:29,635 --> 00:41:33,596
[SPEAKER_03]: And we should be planning it, not like assuming it's going to get better.

389
00:41:34,756 --> 00:41:36,797
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do like the ideas of the survey.

390
00:41:36,817 --> 00:41:42,218
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to walk back my thoughts on not evaluating it, because I do hear what you're saying.

391
00:41:42,238 --> 00:41:44,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you guys need me to close this door?

392
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:45,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it too noisy?

393
00:41:45,238 --> 00:41:46,219
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we can't hear it at all.

394
00:41:46,619 --> 00:41:46,939
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, good.

395
00:41:48,470 --> 00:42:01,177
[SPEAKER_03]: to walk back because I do hear, see the value in knowing whether the reason people aren't using it is because they've heard of these bad things about it, because that would be important, or they've heard, or there's a discomfort about it.

396
00:42:01,277 --> 00:42:04,458
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that that would be valuable information to know that more people would be using it.

397
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:08,660
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wanted to say that part too.

398
00:42:09,641 --> 00:42:12,402
[SPEAKER_03]: There was something else, but I, I'm sorry, I got distracted by the- No, it's okay.

399
00:42:12,843 --> 00:42:13,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

400
00:42:13,403 --> 00:42:14,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye, Jerry.

401
00:42:19,484 --> 00:42:27,368
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, yesterday, I believe, Framingham Public Schools voted to take all transportation in-house.

402
00:42:28,289 --> 00:42:39,434
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of, apparently they need 77 drivers, but they have 54, which to say that creates problems, I just can't even fathom.

403
00:42:39,694 --> 00:42:41,195
[SPEAKER_00]: How does anybody even get to school at all?

404
00:42:42,656 --> 00:42:44,576
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that Jerry's not on the call,

405
00:42:48,451 --> 00:42:49,312
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kidding.

406
00:42:49,372 --> 00:42:51,092
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I would have said it if he was on the call still.

407
00:42:51,172 --> 00:42:56,335
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, when we talk about driver shortages, we really are also not talking about driver shortages.

408
00:42:56,375 --> 00:43:07,300
[SPEAKER_00]: There are enough human beings to drive buses and enough human beings that would be willing to drive buses, but not for the wages that bus companies pay.

409
00:43:08,841 --> 00:43:14,544
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I think about what they're doing over in Framingham, these are probably going to be a unionized group.

410
00:43:14,844 --> 00:43:17,505
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to have benefits and retirement and they're going to get paid

411
00:43:18,623 --> 00:43:22,005
[SPEAKER_00]: a boatload more than any bus company was ever going to pay them.

412
00:43:23,246 --> 00:43:26,667
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll bet they won't have as much trouble finding any bus drivers.

413
00:43:26,988 --> 00:43:36,693
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I realize this particular fiscal year is probably not the year to have that conversation, but the bus driver shortage is not a real thing.

414
00:43:37,433 --> 00:43:41,235
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a made up thing because we refuse to pay people a reasonable wage.

415
00:43:43,116 --> 00:43:47,178
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a bus driver shortage when McDonald's has to shut down because they can't get workers.

416
00:43:48,567 --> 00:43:49,528
[SPEAKER_00]: But they don't shut down.

417
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:51,730
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are workers.

418
00:43:52,491 --> 00:43:57,355
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not trying to, this is not an attack on you, Megan, or anything.

419
00:43:57,576 --> 00:44:00,138
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that's how this is talked about.

420
00:44:00,438 --> 00:44:05,984
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's just really important to talk about it as it really is.

421
00:44:07,465 --> 00:44:10,608
[SPEAKER_00]: We somehow want people, it's the same with the after school conversation.

422
00:44:11,702 --> 00:44:17,924
[SPEAKER_00]: there are people who could work those jobs if we were willing to actually provide the benefits and retirement and enough pay.

423
00:44:18,384 --> 00:44:19,104
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a reality.

424
00:44:19,264 --> 00:44:21,885
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, come on, we all know that.

425
00:44:22,725 --> 00:44:27,566
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Framinghams doing this, it'll be very interesting to see how it works.

426
00:44:27,807 --> 00:44:30,307
[SPEAKER_00]: And I realize financially, they're a very different district.

427
00:44:30,387 --> 00:44:33,008
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the Student Opportunity Act has been kind to them.

428
00:44:34,308 --> 00:44:40,190
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they may well, in fact, be flushed with cash to be able to do something like this that we couldn't do right now.

429
00:44:42,751 --> 00:44:50,877
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing though is, you know, I signed the warrants and I see what we pay to transport our students out of district.

430
00:44:53,278 --> 00:44:58,562
[SPEAKER_00]: We pay per student more than we pay assistant superintendents.

431
00:45:01,664 --> 00:45:04,306
[SPEAKER_00]: Like $6,000, $8,000 per student to go to school 20 days a month.

432
00:45:09,232 --> 00:45:13,776
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and actually, I don't know if that works out to being what I have to pretend to make, assistance to pretend to make.

433
00:45:13,856 --> 00:45:30,289
[SPEAKER_00]: But my point is just that's far more than we would ever pay a unionized retirement eligible and benefits eligible person to do that work, far more.

434
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:35,253
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, I get that there's not a lot of time,

435
00:45:36,903 --> 00:45:42,886
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of energy and it takes a lot of energy and money to talk about getting ahead of it.

436
00:45:43,026 --> 00:45:47,108
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you're always a day behind on this kind of thing.

437
00:45:47,408 --> 00:45:48,828
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we have a student we gotta transport.

438
00:45:49,129 --> 00:45:53,271
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you're not gonna like, okay, let's post a job for a new person to come and become our driver.

439
00:45:53,291 --> 00:45:57,993
[SPEAKER_00]: Like no, the student has to be transported tomorrow morning, starting tomorrow.

440
00:45:59,153 --> 00:46:01,394
[SPEAKER_00]: And so how do we get ahead of that?

441
00:46:01,474 --> 00:46:02,455
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I don't,

442
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:32,425
[SPEAKER_00]: know the exact numbers but we spend a shocking amount of money on out-of-district transportation that and there is just I mean without a spreadsheet in front of me there's like no way we cannot do that for less if we just hire people ourselves take the hit put them in the you know pension and salary and all that other stuff there's just no way that it's cheaper and it also is a huge amount of effort for our staff to be on the constant

443
00:46:34,306 --> 00:46:40,530
[SPEAKER_00]: treadmill of trying to find a new person to, you know, find a company that's willing to transport a student.

444
00:46:42,011 --> 00:46:43,933
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of that stuff doesn't make a lot of sense to me.

445
00:46:46,334 --> 00:46:50,718
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, some of this is, this isn't really about the survey, though, I don't think.

446
00:46:51,658 --> 00:46:55,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Because a lot of this- I think it's about sort of what do you do with the survey afterwards, right?

447
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:56,081
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is okay.

448
00:46:56,101 --> 00:46:56,301
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

449
00:46:56,341 --> 00:46:56,942
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's fine.

450
00:46:57,799 --> 00:46:58,920
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that's a good point.

451
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:08,169
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you know, we're going to get data from students, we're going to get data from parents, but we already have a lot of data of our own that is very relevant to this.

452
00:47:08,389 --> 00:47:12,353
[SPEAKER_00]: And I appreciate that electrification of fleet was just put there, because then I don't have to say it.

453
00:47:14,875 --> 00:47:21,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Did the students at the Student Advisory Council meeting have other transportation related things to talk about?

454
00:47:22,731 --> 00:47:27,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so they raised five concerns, and I just need to find that tab that has it.

455
00:47:28,935 --> 00:47:31,617
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are five concerns.

456
00:47:31,697 --> 00:47:32,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Where did it go?

457
00:47:32,578 --> 00:47:33,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, nope, that's your document.

458
00:47:34,039 --> 00:47:35,079
[SPEAKER_05]: This one's my document.

459
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:36,120
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

460
00:47:37,641 --> 00:47:38,242
[SPEAKER_05]: Was.

461
00:47:38,262 --> 00:47:38,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

462
00:47:47,975 --> 00:47:48,616
[SPEAKER_00]: I have it right here.

463
00:47:48,956 --> 00:48:00,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was the student safety in the bus lines, the setting designated arrival and departure position positions to reduce crowding more buses for North Medford and other underserved areas.

464
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:12,593
[SPEAKER_05]: five and 10 minutes, and it wasn't consistent as to when the arrival time was, and it wasn't time to accommodate people staying late, so that's your late bus question.

465
00:48:13,193 --> 00:48:21,115
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the 95, either comes very early, very late, the early bus is very crowded, the late bus doesn't get people to their jobs on time.

466
00:48:22,716 --> 00:48:24,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Ruseau, did I miss anything?

467
00:48:25,537 --> 00:48:30,278
[SPEAKER_00]: You did not.

468
00:48:30,798 --> 00:48:33,199
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so I think we have a lot of

469
00:48:34,605 --> 00:48:39,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I think we have a lot of questions to answer in the context of the survey.

470
00:48:40,527 --> 00:48:44,628
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think a potential setup is just the baseline.

471
00:48:44,789 --> 00:48:45,749
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you do now?

472
00:48:47,289 --> 00:48:49,670
[SPEAKER_05]: What would you like to do?

473
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:58,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Or do we have questions about getting fewer people taking buses, more bike pool, more walk pools?

474
00:48:58,553 --> 00:49:00,174
[SPEAKER_05]: But what do you do now?

475
00:49:01,502 --> 00:49:04,623
[SPEAKER_05]: What would you do if the options were there for you?

476
00:49:05,263 --> 00:49:18,228
[SPEAKER_05]: And what are the obstacles to getting to those ideals, whether it's walking, biking, buses, carpools, parking?

477
00:49:18,628 --> 00:49:23,710
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that is how this is shaking out for me in assessing what you do.

478
00:49:25,948 --> 00:49:27,870
[SPEAKER_05]: What would you anticipate doing?

479
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:31,653
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want to recognize Megan's point that there's some education around that.

480
00:49:32,033 --> 00:49:37,457
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we could absolutely aim to have fewer cars in the school drop-offs and pickup lines.

481
00:49:38,338 --> 00:49:39,559
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be some education.

482
00:49:39,759 --> 00:49:41,620
[SPEAKER_05]: There's going to be some resistance in the community.

483
00:49:42,141 --> 00:49:48,286
[SPEAKER_05]: But understanding what the barriers are for walking, biking, carpools, busing.

484
00:49:50,008 --> 00:49:59,511
[SPEAKER_05]: is important, so where you're going, and that's specifically what the obstacles are, or as I asked in the beginning of the call, what could we do to facilitate your ideal situation?

485
00:49:59,631 --> 00:50:03,412
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think obstacles is probably the way to go on that.

486
00:50:04,653 --> 00:50:11,875
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what people are experiencing, is they're saying, oh, I'm not doing this because X, Y, or Z. Okay.

487
00:50:11,915 --> 00:50:12,375
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Ruseau?

488
00:50:13,315 --> 00:50:18,297
[SPEAKER_00]: We also did hear, actually, I didn't write it in my notes, but I remember it now from the meeting,

489
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:33,262
[SPEAKER_00]: Students, I don't know how many, but some students are not biking to school because the city made the decision to not do the safe.

490
00:50:33,342 --> 00:50:34,442
[SPEAKER_00]: Protected bike lanes.

491
00:50:34,862 --> 00:50:36,163
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, protected bike lanes.

492
00:50:36,383 --> 00:50:41,404
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a decision the city made to allow for some parking spots.

493
00:50:43,565 --> 00:50:45,726
[SPEAKER_00]: And the consequences are that there are more people

494
00:50:48,325 --> 00:50:49,486
[SPEAKER_00]: getting other ways.

495
00:50:50,486 --> 00:50:54,789
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't sense that the people who would have been biking to school are instead getting on the bus.

496
00:50:54,869 --> 00:50:57,670
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably have a parent dropping them off.

497
00:50:58,831 --> 00:51:02,353
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when the city makes decisions like that, there are consequences.

498
00:51:03,734 --> 00:51:09,157
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that we have to remember that, again, getting back to the project

499
00:51:10,204 --> 00:51:12,385
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the big project that's happening.

500
00:51:14,445 --> 00:51:22,628
[SPEAKER_00]: There are intersections between the city's decisions and our goals, because I think having many kids biking to school would be great.

501
00:51:23,068 --> 00:51:31,371
[SPEAKER_00]: I frankly don't want to have many kids biking to school if we once a year have to go to a funeral.

502
00:51:31,531 --> 00:51:34,912
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the blunt reality of not having protected lanes.

503
00:51:36,592 --> 00:51:38,313
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't let my kids ride a bike to school.

504
00:51:41,838 --> 00:51:59,186
[SPEAKER_05]: For whatever it's worth, the city, I spoke to Todd Blake, city engineer, and they're saying they're in the process of mapping the school addresses of students who take the bus and kind of looking at which roads are getting the traffic and what kind of shape they're in.

505
00:52:00,026 --> 00:52:05,128
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's some coordination with the city once we have these results as well.

506
00:52:06,169 --> 00:52:09,250
[SPEAKER_05]: But they're interested in understanding that.

507
00:52:10,054 --> 00:52:17,476
[SPEAKER_05]: especially since I will note that a lot of these neighborhoods have changed since I imagine the last time we did any kind of transportation assessment.

508
00:52:18,056 --> 00:52:20,617
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, yeah.

509
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:23,498
[SPEAKER_06]: We only have a few minutes left and I wanna be mindful of the time.

510
00:52:23,538 --> 00:52:31,500
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this was like a really, really good discussion and Megan and I can take some work on to craft some questions and things like that.

511
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:37,922
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think the other question, to your point about outreach, I think we do need to think about,

512
00:52:39,682 --> 00:52:40,965
[SPEAKER_06]: How do we get participation?

513
00:52:40,985 --> 00:52:44,294
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we certainly.

514
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:50,383
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, we could think about like the timing of the survey and when it goes out.

515
00:52:50,423 --> 00:52:58,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, are we interested in this going out like in September when we can like send it with like all the other paperwork that goes home and ask people to do it?

516
00:52:59,069 --> 00:53:00,470
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that a terrible time of year?

517
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:11,918
[SPEAKER_06]: So really interested in like what the right timing of this is that would allow us to collect good data and still position us to

518
00:53:13,159 --> 00:53:18,562
[SPEAKER_06]: use the data to inform any sort of RFP we need to do for our yellow bus service next year.

519
00:53:18,582 --> 00:53:30,769
[SPEAKER_06]: But also think about like, what are the mechanisms where people are the most like, where we are the most likely to be able to convince people to do this?

520
00:53:33,050 --> 00:53:42,075
[SPEAKER_06]: And how do we, you know, how do we sort of capitalize on high participation kinds of like,

521
00:53:43,999 --> 00:53:46,080
[SPEAKER_06]: moments to like get people to engage.

522
00:53:46,120 --> 00:54:01,789
[SPEAKER_06]: I think students like we have some we have options like you know using their advisory blocks and we can even have like a drawing of some kind right like we could do something that incentives people to reply from a student perspective.

523
00:54:02,229 --> 00:54:06,712
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's less less what's the right word less

524
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:16,966
[SPEAKER_06]: motivating maybe to parents who are like, I get 100 emails a day, I'm not going to take the time to do this right for a $5 gift card.

525
00:54:17,026 --> 00:54:25,892
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, are there other reasons why I think there's a swath of families that will be highly motivated to do this, but I am equally concerned that

526
00:54:26,733 --> 00:54:35,175
[SPEAKER_06]: we want to hear maybe more from the families who don't fill it out, or at least as much.

527
00:54:35,255 --> 00:54:39,575
[SPEAKER_06]: So how do we create a way to get to them too?

528
00:54:39,595 --> 00:54:41,456
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Ruseau?

529
00:54:42,036 --> 00:54:42,336
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

530
00:54:42,676 --> 00:54:52,838
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when I was looking at the state schools survey results, you know, while they have this like morning, afternoon, a beach day thing, which I think is great, and you see some fascinating variability,

531
00:54:54,526 --> 00:55:21,714
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of, I'm struck that there's, and believe me, nobody wants to put out a survey with 350 questions, but I am struck by the fact that there seems to be no recognition that what you do in January versus what you do in May and September, if you're a hardcore biker, you may be like, all right, we have two feet of snow this entire February.

532
00:55:22,222 --> 00:55:24,463
[SPEAKER_00]: every Monday, and maybe I won't bike.

533
00:55:25,323 --> 00:55:26,943
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no seasonality, that's the word.

534
00:55:27,223 --> 00:55:31,444
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm hoping that Safe Schools is always like, this is the date.

535
00:55:32,525 --> 00:55:35,085
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, that data seems like that would be a little questionable.

536
00:55:35,125 --> 00:55:44,228
[SPEAKER_00]: But it seems important also, because if we put the survey out in September, it's beautiful out.

537
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:47,121
[SPEAKER_00]: People who want to bike are biking.

538
00:55:48,862 --> 00:55:58,148
[SPEAKER_00]: We may get a false sense of how much traffic there's going to be if we did some change, how much actual use of busing is there going to be.

539
00:55:58,168 --> 00:56:02,130
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I just feel like that seasonality stuff.

540
00:56:02,391 --> 00:56:03,631
[SPEAKER_00]: And it isn't just seasonality.

541
00:56:03,651 --> 00:56:04,372
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's weather.

542
00:56:04,932 --> 00:56:12,437
[SPEAKER_00]: I would put a slash weather on that, because I mean, I'm assuming that when the oyster comes through,

543
00:56:13,939 --> 00:56:18,081
[SPEAKER_00]: there might be fewer people biking, possibly.

544
00:56:18,821 --> 00:56:20,402
[SPEAKER_00]: Erica, remember Ryfeld, I know.

545
00:56:21,042 --> 00:56:24,824
[SPEAKER_00]: Those things don't put her off, but for the less hearty of us.

546
00:56:26,565 --> 00:56:26,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

547
00:56:29,106 --> 00:56:29,546
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

548
00:56:30,027 --> 00:56:33,328
[SPEAKER_06]: It's 531, so we'll wrap this up here.

549
00:56:34,589 --> 00:56:39,991
[SPEAKER_06]: If there is anything else that you all are thinking about, just go ahead and shoot me a note.

550
00:56:40,031 --> 00:56:42,673
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Megan, I will connect with you, and we can find some time to.

551
00:56:43,915 --> 00:56:44,095
[SPEAKER_06]: Um.

552
00:56:44,996 --> 00:56:46,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Get through the next steps here and.

553
00:56:48,117 --> 00:56:55,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, then once we have that, I will be back in touch to schedule another meeting for us to review because the next the thing after that, um.

554
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:01,082
[SPEAKER_06]: Will be to bring this to the full committee, which I think we said we would do by June so.

555
00:57:03,953 --> 00:57:05,214
[SPEAKER_00]: Motion to adjourn.

556
00:57:05,414 --> 00:57:10,598
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm noting Megan's comment in the chat here about asking families to sign up for the bus in May this year.

557
00:57:10,958 --> 00:57:21,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that mean there's content you'd like to have ready with that sign up to say, you're not asking for a preliminary survey response or we shouldn't try to push things to meet that?

558
00:57:21,886 --> 00:57:24,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

559
00:57:26,509 --> 00:57:33,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if this is the moment when everyone's ready to talk about their transportation needs, I don't want to miss an opportunity.

560
00:57:34,394 --> 00:57:34,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.

561
00:57:36,637 --> 00:57:38,318
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't think that we should rush it.

562
00:57:38,678 --> 00:57:49,946
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that this is, especially because we're talking about the end of next year being when our contract is up, I think we should be thoughtful about this survey and take time and not try and squeeze it into this May.

563
00:57:50,266 --> 00:58:03,195
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just asking for the signups in May so that we can better get a handle on who's signing up that's not eligible and if there's any rerouting that we need to do and notifying families ahead with plenty of time.

564
00:58:03,555 --> 00:58:04,976
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just to buy myself more time.

565
00:58:05,816 --> 00:58:07,797
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that makes a lot of sense.

566
00:58:08,157 --> 00:58:26,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think rushing the survey would be too much, but if we happen to have it ready to go, we might give it at the same time, saying nothing's changing yet, but we're just, you know, everything's in place for next year with some, you know, we reserved the right to make a couple of changes, but we just wanted to ask this survey for strategic planning for the future.

567
00:58:27,306 --> 00:58:28,066
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I would recommend.

568
00:58:30,035 --> 00:58:37,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham, do you know if this kind of assessment for a new high school, would this be a separate effort to understand the needs there?

569
00:58:40,523 --> 00:58:41,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Good question.

570
00:58:41,363 --> 00:58:52,088
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it can be, but I think if there's data that we can like use and leverage, we can certainly provide that to, it would really be to the folks doing the feasibility study.

571
00:58:52,188 --> 00:58:58,651
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think they would be interested in like sizing sort of what those needs are from a feasibility perspective.

572
00:58:58,691 --> 00:59:05,674
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think if we have input that we can provide them, that will be useful, but I assume that they also will have their own

573
00:59:06,414 --> 00:59:10,516
[SPEAKER_06]: ways that they recommend sort of getting answers to those questions, so.

574
00:59:10,836 --> 00:59:14,878
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I know building and grounds are separate, separate entities for people.

575
00:59:15,299 --> 00:59:17,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

576
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:21,782
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, I think probably both is the short answer.

577
00:59:22,382 --> 00:59:22,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.

578
00:59:23,683 --> 00:59:24,603
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

579
00:59:24,663 --> 00:59:26,524
[SPEAKER_06]: I heard a motion to adjourn by Member Ruseau.

580
00:59:26,544 --> 00:59:28,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I can second that.

581
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:31,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Seconded by Member Reinfeld.

582
00:59:31,307 --> 00:59:32,227
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll do a roll call.

583
00:59:32,768 --> 00:59:33,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Reinfeld?

584
00:59:33,828 --> 00:59:34,068
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

585
00:59:34,769 --> 00:59:35,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Ruseau?

586
00:59:36,004 --> 00:59:36,245
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

587
00:59:36,746 --> 00:59:37,548
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham, yes.

588
00:59:38,610 --> 00:59:40,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Three in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

589
00:59:40,454 --> 00:59:41,256
[SPEAKER_06]: The meeting is adjourned.

590
00:59:41,476 --> 00:59:42,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, everyone.

591
00:59:42,439 --> 00:59:43,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Good night, everyone.
