1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:03,093
and welcome to this special meeting of the Medford Zoning Board of Appeals.

2
00:00:03,113 --> 00:00:06,975
We're gonna take a quick roll call and then we'll get started.

3
00:00:06,995 --> 00:00:10,617
Amy Thompson.

4
00:00:10,637 --> 00:00:12,158
Present.

5
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:13,659
Gerani.

6
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:14,740
Present.

7
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,421
Andre LaRue.

8
00:00:17,141 --> 00:00:17,501
Present.

9
00:00:19,422 --> 00:00:24,045
I believe that Velez is absent.

10
00:00:25,626 --> 00:00:26,867
Recording in progress.

11
00:00:27,407 --> 00:00:28,808
Leigh, also absent.

12
00:00:30,011 --> 00:00:30,732
Christie better.

13
00:00:32,513 --> 00:00:36,075
Presence and then Mike held their present.

14
00:00:37,076 --> 00:00:37,456
All right.

15
00:00:37,876 --> 00:00:40,578
We have a quorum and it's you please kick us off.

16
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:51,405
On March 29 2023 governor he was under the law supplemental budget bill which among other things extends the temporary provisions between the opening of March 31st 2025.

17
00:00:53,217 --> 00:01:01,525
specifically this further extension allows public bodies to be holding meetings remotely without a quorum of the public body physically present at any location and provide adequate alternative access to remote meetings.

18
00:01:02,026 --> 00:01:09,233
Bland's substantive change to the open meeting allows an extending the expiration date of the temporary provisions regarding remote meetings from March 31st, 2023 to March 31st, 2025.

19
00:01:09,293 --> 00:01:09,733
Great, thank you.

20
00:01:09,753 --> 00:01:11,375
Before we get into our first item, I just want to

21
00:01:17,733 --> 00:01:23,777
say out loud, the Medford Zoning Board of Appeals annually elects a chair from its membership.

22
00:01:24,297 --> 00:01:41,209
At our last regular meeting, Jamie Thompson was elected as our chair for the next year, but this is a long-running hearing, and so for the sake of consistency, I will be continuing on as acting chair for the duration of this hearing.

23
00:01:41,389 --> 00:01:42,670
So I just wanted to make sure

24
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,951
That was said out loud and understood.

25
00:01:46,672 --> 00:01:49,673
With that being said, Dennis, can you please read the first item?

26
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:56,537
970 Felsway case number 40B-2023-01, continued from April 23rd.

27
00:01:57,037 --> 00:02:10,764
The resumption of consideration of petition of DIV Felsway LLC, the Davis Company, for a comprehensive permit pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 40B for multifamily six-story apartment development located in approximately 3.4 acres of land in 970 Felsway, property ID 7-02-10.

28
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:19,846
This proposal will be developed as approximately 289 units, 228 units, multi family housing and 11 pounds.

29
00:02:19,887 --> 00:02:24,571
The 7325% of the total units are being designated as affordable housing to low moderate income households.

30
00:02:26,084 --> 00:02:26,404
Thank you.

31
00:02:27,045 --> 00:02:27,605
All right, folks.

32
00:02:27,645 --> 00:02:29,327
So this is a long-running hearing.

33
00:02:29,727 --> 00:02:34,210
The board has been hearing this since last November.

34
00:02:34,991 --> 00:02:49,963
And so in this session, the intention is there was a peer review conducted by the beta group of both the civil engineering and the traffic considerations for this project.

35
00:02:50,523 --> 00:02:51,564
The board has received

36
00:02:52,765 --> 00:02:54,847
It is peer review letters on both topics.

37
00:02:55,327 --> 00:03:01,712
My understanding is that the proponent has also had time to review those letters and to formulate responses.

38
00:03:02,553 --> 00:03:10,939
And my intention, having heard indirectly from all involved, is that my understanding is that

39
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:19,544
The proponent intends to make a presentation, which will include civil and traffic, as well as details on some of the responses.

40
00:03:19,684 --> 00:03:30,310
And then we have two representatives from Beta Group on the line, who we will consult with as needed if the board or the public has any clarifying questions.

41
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:34,992
So with that being said, I see we have Pat Noon for the applicant.

42
00:03:35,612 --> 00:03:36,053
Good evening.

43
00:03:36,373 --> 00:03:36,833
Please go ahead.

44
00:03:39,483 --> 00:03:42,606
Yes, thank you, Mr. Chair, members of the board.

45
00:03:43,867 --> 00:03:46,269
Everyone, thank you for having us again here this evening.

46
00:03:47,029 --> 00:03:48,651
And thank you for the summary.

47
00:03:49,311 --> 00:03:52,774
So you have made my job a bit easier.

48
00:03:52,894 --> 00:03:56,017
I will make my introduction and summary brief.

49
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:11,573
We are here this evening with just a bit of an update from the last time that we presented at the previous hearing, which was focused primarily on architecture and design.

50
00:04:13,174 --> 00:04:17,459
Since that time, we have been able to, as you said,

51
00:04:20,062 --> 00:04:33,822
digest, study, and provide responses to the peer review comments provided by the beta team on traffic and as well as civil and site.

52
00:04:35,244 --> 00:04:59,961
those response to comments were submitted and this week we re-engaged with the beta team on traffic and civil in a peer review session to discuss the responses to comments and try to answer any additional questions or just confirm that our responses were clear

53
00:05:00,961 --> 00:05:02,824
and that there weren't subsequent questions.

54
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:11,433
The beta team, not to speak for them, is still digesting the responses that we submitted to them.

55
00:05:12,434 --> 00:05:21,644
Our intention this evening is to provide, as you said, a bit of a formal presentation on the responses that we provided.

56
00:05:22,945 --> 00:05:40,637
and with the goal of really trying to highlight some of the outstanding questions that have been asked at previous hearings or questions that we felt required a formal public response as a part of the beta comments.

57
00:05:41,998 --> 00:05:50,603
For example, the traffic peer review that was given to us by BETA included 80 comments.

58
00:05:50,763 --> 00:06:02,951
So this evening, we will not be responding to all 80, but a collection of those that we felt like were the most important to address and make sure were clear for the board and for BETA and for members of the public.

59
00:06:03,771 --> 00:06:06,113
So just generally summarizing,

60
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:25,914
Our intention for this evening is to present and with our goal being we are trying to answer questions as thoroughly as possible and make sure that everything is clear and leave everyone feeling like we have answered the questions that have been asked.

61
00:06:26,495 --> 00:06:34,940
With that, I will turn it over to Steve Matarano from Bowler, who will start and manage the presentation.

62
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:45,565
We will run through civil and then turn it over to Scott Thornton from Van Ness, who will address the traffic-related items.

63
00:06:45,845 --> 00:06:48,767
So with that, I'll turn it over to you, Steve.

64
00:06:48,827 --> 00:06:49,127
Thank you.

65
00:06:49,607 --> 00:06:49,828
Great.

66
00:06:50,068 --> 00:06:50,408
Thank you.

67
00:06:50,428 --> 00:06:53,489
So again, Steve Matarano from Bowler.

68
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:57,171
civil engineers and landscape architects on the project.

69
00:06:57,271 --> 00:07:05,532
We'll be pretty brief, but appreciate the time that Beta's put in, and obviously this board and the public.

70
00:07:05,632 --> 00:07:11,594
And we think the comments have been great and helpful in shaping some of the infrastructure.

71
00:07:12,894 --> 00:07:21,236
And a lot of our changes are underground, so the site plan itself might not look a lot different, but we'll run you through the presentation here.

72
00:07:23,256 --> 00:07:47,803
Just the agenda, we'll hit the civil site, peer review comments, and then however the board wants to handle it, if I do see the beta team on the call, if you want to run through the civil engineering portion and then get their comments there, I'll pause at the end of our civil presentation, if that makes sense, or we can get through our whole presentation and then hear all the beta comments at once.

73
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,411
Yeah, I'm torn on it.

74
00:07:51,811 --> 00:08:04,778
I think in the absence of a suggestion one way or the other, I think doing civil check-in with beta and then traffic check-in again makes the most sense to me.

75
00:08:04,878 --> 00:08:05,138
Sure.

76
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:05,919
Great.

77
00:08:07,544 --> 00:08:09,185
So we'll get started here.

78
00:08:11,147 --> 00:08:18,311
As I mentioned, the surface updates are not much.

79
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:20,573
Really, we'll have some detail.

80
00:08:20,713 --> 00:08:27,317
We have some in the next slides, we'll show you some of the details we've added to address the surface conditions.

81
00:08:28,318 --> 00:08:31,820
Really, some traffic patterns, we've looked at some parking conditions.

82
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,862
But the overall site plan is what we've seen at previous hearings.

83
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:47,430
One of the details we heard very clearly was we were showing exterior spaces and we were committing to a number of interior spaces.

84
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:51,232
Now we're showing what that looks like on this slide.

85
00:08:51,252 --> 00:08:56,055
So we have combined between exterior and interior, we have 66

86
00:08:59,077 --> 00:09:01,377
EV spaces that would be delivered day one.

87
00:09:02,158 --> 00:09:08,259
And as we discussed in previous hearings, there's an opportunity to grow that number inside the garage.

88
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:17,161
As demand grows over the years, it's a little easier to expand that internally, a little more challenging to do the external expansion.

89
00:09:17,221 --> 00:09:23,022
So just showing what that looks like and how that compares to the overall parking field.

90
00:09:26,596 --> 00:09:40,433
This one here we talked about a lot, which is, again, this is the same slide we've seen previously that shows the in and out movements and how if somebody comes in Myrtle Street, they would maneuver around this.

91
00:09:41,374 --> 00:09:50,224
this entry point, which is one way in the entrance, the pink line, and then they could proceed out to the Felsway or proceed into the garage.

92
00:09:50,645 --> 00:09:57,112
That's probably the movement we looked at the most to make sure we're being sensitive to some of the comments we heard about

93
00:09:58,153 --> 00:10:08,396
Are we making sure that our residents are more directly, it's more convenient to use some of the other access points?

94
00:10:08,556 --> 00:10:14,438
Would there be some risk of folks trying to use Myrtle Street?

95
00:10:15,538 --> 00:10:20,144
as a pathway into the garages as it was sort of a daily flow pattern?

96
00:10:20,164 --> 00:10:28,273
Does that, does having this sort of ceremonial drop-off area drive additional traffic to Myrtle Street?

97
00:10:28,413 --> 00:10:31,336
And I've got some slides in a moment that will show

98
00:10:32,918 --> 00:10:40,300
what those routes look like for people coming from either direction, whether they're coming up Merrill Street towards Amaranth or whether they're on the Fellsway.

99
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:49,742
And what we've done here is we already think it's a circuitous route to come in that way to get into the garage.

100
00:10:50,642 --> 00:10:56,984
But here we've added some speed limit signs, a stop line and stop bar here.

101
00:10:57,524 --> 00:11:00,985
Again, a few additional nuanced measures.

102
00:11:03,085 --> 00:11:09,089
to make this really what it is, a low-use,

103
00:11:10,358 --> 00:11:25,689
rental, you know, future tenants coming to look at the building, they're going to be directed to this main entrance, a drop-off condition, you know, somebody coming here for the first time, punching in an address, they're going to get to this point.

104
00:11:26,689 --> 00:11:28,971
We allow them to come in the site.

105
00:11:29,571 --> 00:11:38,418
We don't anticipate and we purposely slow people down with the stop sign, with the stop sign here and the speed limit sign as you come in to show

106
00:11:39,438 --> 00:11:51,183
This is a slow zone, there'll be some cobblestone paving or something of that nature that makes it a very low volume, low speed area, really to make it what it is.

107
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:53,564
We want this to be a low volume entrance.

108
00:11:54,104 --> 00:11:56,805
And the residents will find that very, very quickly of

109
00:11:57,585 --> 00:12:09,011
wow, that's a little, it's slow, it's circuitous, it's not by any means, not my fastest way to get into the garage and get into my parking space to get to my home, right?

110
00:12:09,951 --> 00:12:21,637
And I'll show you some slides, but those are the physical improvements or some signage and some physical stop signs that slow folks down and make that not the most convenient route.

111
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,761
Why do we need that route?

112
00:12:25,342 --> 00:12:31,767
It's critical to being able to get this full 360 degree circulation around the building.

113
00:12:31,787 --> 00:12:35,450
So this is the city of Medford fire truck and what that looks like.

114
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:41,174
And we're trying to accommodate their desire to have the full 360 degree access around the building.

115
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:52,624
So we're trying to work with what works for public safety, fire safety, and the fire department, and how do we also drive this to be the lowest volume entrance.

116
00:12:54,279 --> 00:13:02,470
So we did some distance studies here that shows, you know, somebody coming down the Felsway to get in the garage.

117
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:10,321
If they come in the main entrance, which is what we anticipate into the garage, it's a pretty straightforward shot and it's 522 feet.

118
00:13:12,415 --> 00:13:22,379
If they turn down Myrtle Street and come in through the drop-off area, stop at the stop sign and come around into the garage, it's 802 feet.

119
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,261
So it's quite a bit longer distance and obviously many more turning movements and stopping.

120
00:13:27,341 --> 00:13:32,883
That's the inconvenience factor we add in to drive people to the entrances.

121
00:13:32,923 --> 00:13:36,185
We want them to be coming in and out of on a routine basis.

122
00:13:37,465 --> 00:13:42,551
And we did a similar look in Amaranth, it's even a longer, you know, difference.

123
00:13:43,311 --> 00:13:55,724
Somebody coming up Myrtle Street, turning down Amaranth, they come right into the garage, pretty straight shot, not a lot of turning, no stop controls, so it's a pretty fast entrance, a little under 400 feet there.

124
00:13:57,005 --> 00:14:07,679
And again, to come through and around and utilize that for in and out, it's not quite double the distance, but it's pretty close in the inconvenience factor.

125
00:14:07,739 --> 00:14:11,063
So we just wanted to, we have studied it.

126
00:14:11,544 --> 00:14:12,084
We think

127
00:14:12,905 --> 00:14:29,157
it's better to not restrict this lane again, but we wanted to take another look at it because we think if we restrict this lane in some manner, it's going to drive people back out onto Myrtle Street to come around and get in the garage.

128
00:14:29,397 --> 00:14:37,083
So, we think it's actually more of a detriment to restrict that than to keep it as an all-way maneuver.

129
00:14:39,964 --> 00:14:46,630
This graphic here, again, this is the same graphic just demonstrating the on-street parking.

130
00:14:47,051 --> 00:14:56,680
We have laid in some conservative vehicles along here to show that we do have that replicating at least 20, and these are

131
00:14:57,441 --> 00:15:09,148
These are full-size vehicles parked with good separation, which anybody who's lived in the city knows that people don't always leave a big separation and not everybody has a full-size vehicle.

132
00:15:09,228 --> 00:15:13,470
It could be a smart car and you could end up getting five cars in here or something more.

133
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:21,495
But conservatively, we've laid out 20 full-size vehicles between Amaranth and Myrtle, just to show what that looks like and to show that we have

134
00:15:22,435 --> 00:15:29,657
Again, we factored in the existing utility poles and the electric infrastructure all remains where it is.

135
00:15:29,917 --> 00:15:33,658
And these have all been designed around it and sort of fit in between.

136
00:15:33,678 --> 00:15:39,380
So we took a look at Amaranth and the same look here on Myrtle Street.

137
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:47,822
So all of these zones that have electric equipment have been, they'll just be curved out and grassed areas.

138
00:15:50,835 --> 00:15:54,479
And then this slide's got a lot of information on it.

139
00:15:54,679 --> 00:16:05,892
You don't have to read all the words, but this was really where I said most of the comments from the civil side were drainage-related, and we

140
00:16:06,292 --> 00:16:07,814
We appreciated Beta's comments.

141
00:16:08,254 --> 00:16:13,680
I think it's added some redundancy in the system and made it a better system.

142
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:16,543
But the changes are relatively minor.

143
00:16:16,623 --> 00:16:20,647
The infiltration systems remain as originally designed.

144
00:16:21,108 --> 00:16:22,930
We've moved some pipes around.

145
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:23,810
We've created

146
00:16:25,412 --> 00:16:32,281
down in the bottom right-hand corner, there's already an existing pipe that takes mostly the self-storage building.

147
00:16:32,681 --> 00:16:38,509
We've incorporated a high storm overflow, so 10-year storm.

148
00:16:38,529 --> 00:16:39,970
We're talking five or six inches.

149
00:16:40,811 --> 00:16:43,114
If we get to that level of flooding, this provides

150
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:55,848
a little bit of relief out of the system and we'll make the system operate a little better, make sure we're not overtopping catch basins in those rare extreme events.

151
00:16:55,928 --> 00:16:59,351
But we think it was a good ad and a great comment.

152
00:17:00,393 --> 00:17:11,685
And the rest are really just, this slide was really designed to show beta, really the detailed technical changes that we're making.

153
00:17:12,426 --> 00:17:14,528
I'm happy to go into that level of detail.

154
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:20,194
It's a little nerdy, so I'll leave that if there's questions on the details, but really,

155
00:17:21,055 --> 00:17:23,197
The overarching system is unchanged.

156
00:17:24,097 --> 00:17:30,041
Some of the overflow conditions and some of the treatment units have been upgraded and modified slightly.

157
00:17:30,421 --> 00:17:35,784
So with that, that is the end of our civil presentation.

158
00:17:36,985 --> 00:17:44,230
So Chairman Caldera, if you wanna ask questions or turn it over to the peer reviewer, happy to turn it back.

159
00:17:45,089 --> 00:17:49,231
Yeah, I'll turn it over to Bill McGrath from Beta.

160
00:17:49,531 --> 00:18:01,836
Bill, if you could just kind of share your general, your original concerns with the project and just your reaction to some of the proposed changes here.

161
00:18:02,877 --> 00:18:03,597
Sure.

162
00:18:03,657 --> 00:18:05,338
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

163
00:18:05,838 --> 00:18:07,639
Bill McGrath with Beta Group.

164
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:10,620
We did the civil site peer review.

165
00:18:12,457 --> 00:18:15,261
We provided a letter to the board dated May 3rd.

166
00:18:15,281 --> 00:18:18,365
I won't go through every individual comment.

167
00:18:18,565 --> 00:18:21,810
Some of them are just minor details to adjust.

168
00:18:22,952 --> 00:18:26,116
So I'll just go through some of the more significant ones.

169
00:18:27,718 --> 00:18:31,061
I would say in general that the site layout is appropriate.

170
00:18:32,022 --> 00:18:35,305
Site circulation layout is good.

171
00:18:36,706 --> 00:18:52,621
One thing we will suggest, you know, if the project continues to advance and gets into the construction stage, that the applicant prepare a construction management plan for the board.

172
00:18:53,883 --> 00:19:09,370
for the neighbors that would lay out things like hours of operation, days of operation, truck routes to and from the site, noise control, dust control, those types of construction issues.

173
00:19:13,648 --> 00:19:21,834
As Stephen had mentioned, we also looked at the stormwater drainage system and reviewed the analysis that was done.

174
00:19:21,854 --> 00:19:26,477
And again, the analysis was done appropriately.

175
00:19:26,497 --> 00:19:40,267
Our concerns were that in larger storms, it appeared that the system would surcharge and there'd be a potential for water ponding in the parking lot and impacting some of the parking spaces.

176
00:19:42,809 --> 00:19:47,011
I think the overflow system that was presented makes sense.

177
00:19:47,391 --> 00:19:55,854
We just received the revised analysis, so we haven't gone through the numbers yet, but I think the concept makes a lot of sense.

178
00:19:58,535 --> 00:19:59,275
Excuse me.

179
00:20:00,336 --> 00:20:04,737
A couple of comments just on the site.

180
00:20:05,758 --> 00:20:09,799
There is a mass electric easement that runs along the south side of the site.

181
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:17,917
An electrical duct bank that's buried underground through that section?

182
00:20:18,358 --> 00:20:19,139
Yeah, exactly.

183
00:20:20,881 --> 00:20:23,964
Again, not likely an issue.

184
00:20:23,984 --> 00:20:33,253
We just want to confirm that there's no restrictions contained within that easement that would prevent the applicant from doing certain things.

185
00:20:34,868 --> 00:20:45,972
So they've committed to researching that and getting back to the board just to confirm that what they're proposing is allowed within the easement.

186
00:20:46,132 --> 00:20:52,774
The second piece is the subdivision of the two parcels, parcel A and parcel B.

187
00:20:55,843 --> 00:21:11,768
Yeah, along that line, that subdivision is going to require that part of the driveway circulation for the driveway and the parking occurs on lot A, the existing self-storage building.

188
00:21:12,768 --> 00:21:23,472
So our comment was simply to provide the board with assurances that there'll be some kind of easement agreement between the two lots

189
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:38,215
so that there's rights in perpetuity for the development and the residents of the development to be able to use that driveway, and also for emergency vehicles as well.

190
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:48,439
We had a few comments related to off-site, excuse me.

191
00:21:51,545 --> 00:21:57,489
The two crosswalks, one across Myrtle Street and the second across Amaranth Ave.

192
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:08,837
There's new curb ramps, pedestrian curb ramps proposed as part of the development on the developer side.

193
00:22:09,938 --> 00:22:18,904
We've suggested evaluating the existing ramps on Myrtle Street and on the other side of Amaranth.

194
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:21,986
to confirm that they're ADA compliant.

195
00:22:23,466 --> 00:22:31,088
If they have to be reconstructed as part of the project, they should be, so that the entire crossing is compliant.

196
00:22:33,109 --> 00:22:39,630
They've committed to doing that, but doing that as part of further advancing the design.

197
00:22:43,251 --> 00:22:45,672
We've also suggested that looking at the

198
00:22:47,517 --> 00:22:55,324
The pedestrian curb ramps at the Myrtle Street Felsway intersection, since that's likely to be a major pedestrian route for the development.

199
00:22:56,184 --> 00:23:03,410
And if those need to be upgraded to conform to ADA, that that be included as part of the project as well.

200
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:24,489
And that the limits of resurfacing and milling and resurfacing Myrtle Street be reviewed as the project advances so that it's not left with any kind of trench patching or patching along the curb where the curb line's changing for the on-street parking.

201
00:23:25,909 --> 00:23:29,572
Again, they've committed to looking at all that, but

202
00:23:30,493 --> 00:23:35,220
I think it's more appropriate to look at that as the design advances.

203
00:23:36,983 --> 00:23:40,789
Again, this is still preliminary design phase.

204
00:23:45,140 --> 00:24:00,429
if it does move through an approval that anything that's not addressed as part of the preliminary plan be included as conditions of approval so that it's documented and on the record as the project advances.

205
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:04,771
Those were really our main comments.

206
00:24:05,651 --> 00:24:08,173
The other comments pertain to

207
00:24:09,765 --> 00:24:28,414
certain details on the plans, adding details of things like the underground infiltration system, checking to make sure that the cover conditions over proposed drainage pipe, that that's appropriate.

208
00:24:31,196 --> 00:24:35,638
So again, I would say overall, from a civil site perspective,

209
00:24:37,626 --> 00:24:40,787
the project seems headed in the right direction.

210
00:24:41,708 --> 00:24:47,731
And I think circulation layout is all appropriate, both vehicular and pedestrian.

211
00:24:51,252 --> 00:24:51,492
Great.

212
00:24:51,572 --> 00:24:52,153
Thank you, Bill.

213
00:24:54,013 --> 00:25:03,878
With that, I will open it up to the board for questions, either to Bill with the beta group or to the proponent on this presentation.

214
00:25:09,652 --> 00:25:11,774
Andre, please go ahead.

215
00:25:11,814 --> 00:25:12,654
Thanks, Mike.

216
00:25:13,655 --> 00:25:23,462
Bill, I'm wondering if you had any recommendations for the intersection of Myrtle, Amaranth, and Lawrence.

217
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:29,045
There's a lot of pavement there and strange navigating of

218
00:25:30,126 --> 00:25:44,729
of vehicular traffic and while this might not be exactly all the responsibility of the project proponent, I'm just wondering what should be done there and if you had thoughts about that.

219
00:25:46,145 --> 00:25:53,329
So we did look at that, and I think that was addressed more in the transportation review that was done.

220
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:54,370
Yeah, sorry.

221
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:56,051
My apologies.

222
00:25:56,491 --> 00:25:57,812
Yeah, no, no.

223
00:25:58,592 --> 00:26:00,893
So I think there are some improvements.

224
00:26:00,953 --> 00:26:06,036
There's some challenges as well that it doesn't become too restrictive for turning movements.

225
00:26:08,757 --> 00:26:08,897
So.

226
00:26:10,358 --> 00:26:15,921
I think maybe it's better addressed when we go through the transportation traffic review.

227
00:26:17,322 --> 00:26:19,423
Yeah, sorry about that, my fault.

228
00:26:19,823 --> 00:26:34,771
What I would say, any improvements that might be made, we need to, again, look at pedestrian movements, because as curb lines may change, the location of crosswalks may want to change as well.

229
00:26:39,605 --> 00:26:43,670
I think that's probably as deep as I can go into that subject at the moment.

230
00:26:48,035 --> 00:26:48,355
All right.

231
00:26:48,495 --> 00:26:51,098
Other questions or comments from the board?

232
00:27:00,481 --> 00:27:14,614
So, Bill, I didn't see specific reference in the peer review letter to this whole one way versus two way flow at the Myrtle Street entrance.

233
00:27:15,395 --> 00:27:22,882
So in the presentation, we got some details on the thought process behind keeping it two way.

234
00:27:23,022 --> 00:27:24,543
I just wanted to check in with you.

235
00:27:24,624 --> 00:27:24,844
Are you

236
00:27:25,818 --> 00:27:30,444
Aligned to way is the right approach for that entrance.

237
00:27:31,666 --> 00:27:33,748
Yeah, I think we are, um.

238
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:39,155
We did look at it and again, I think it's partly shared with the, the, um.

239
00:27:39,956 --> 00:27:42,559
Traffic transportation peer review as well.

240
00:27:43,735 --> 00:27:52,963
And we had a meeting as Pat Noon had referenced yesterday afternoon, where we walked through that circulation study.

241
00:27:53,563 --> 00:27:55,985
So I think it does make sense to leave it as two-way.

242
00:27:57,627 --> 00:28:10,737
We had talked about possibly some wayfinding signs, particularly for Amaranth Ave to encourage drivers to use Amaranth if they're coming from that direction to get into the garage.

243
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:17,071
But it may be overly restrictive to try to make it one way.

244
00:28:17,611 --> 00:28:23,032
So yes, I think we're in agreement that two-way circulation makes sense.

245
00:28:25,132 --> 00:28:25,452
OK.

246
00:28:25,732 --> 00:28:28,153
And then what about snow removal?

247
00:28:28,493 --> 00:28:41,455
It's a little hard for me to tell whether the site already has adequate capacity to absorb snow, or if that's something that would need to be considered and conditioned.

248
00:28:42,226 --> 00:28:44,907
Yeah, so that's a good point.

249
00:28:45,007 --> 00:28:50,668
And I think that's something, as the design advances, those areas be designated.

250
00:28:51,928 --> 00:28:56,629
The way the site is laid out, I think there's adequate space to store snow on site.

251
00:28:57,389 --> 00:29:01,130
Some of the landscaped islands certainly are appropriate.

252
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:04,971
So I think it's certainly manageable.

253
00:29:05,651 --> 00:29:10,012
But as the design advances, I think those areas need to be designated.

254
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:11,844
OK.

255
00:29:12,245 --> 00:29:22,513
And then the designated locations on the south side for at least for move-ins, maybe for loading as well, that's a little I don't remember.

256
00:29:22,753 --> 00:29:29,859
But that's an adequate capacity from your perspective and a good location?

257
00:29:29,879 --> 00:29:30,940
Yeah.

258
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:34,062
And again, being a short-term operation,

259
00:29:37,292 --> 00:29:46,920
Probably some signing will be appropriate in the final condition, just to make it clear where those areas are and how they're designated.

260
00:29:48,962 --> 00:29:54,046
But from an operational circulation standpoint, I think what's being proposed makes sense.

261
00:29:56,508 --> 00:29:57,329
OK, thank you.

262
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:01,793
Other questions or comments from the board?

263
00:30:04,966 --> 00:30:07,429
Sorry, I'm going to try again.

264
00:30:07,469 --> 00:30:09,412
I mean, this may actually be the, you know.

265
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:17,402
You're the right person or not on this, but this may be more kind of overlap with the architecture as well.

266
00:30:17,442 --> 00:30:18,984
But I'm curious about the lighting.

267
00:30:19,004 --> 00:30:23,349
1 of the concerns the neighbors had was that this was going to just really kind of.

268
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:28,694
light up and shine a lot into their homes.

269
00:30:28,714 --> 00:30:38,202
I'm just curious whether you guys have looked at the lighting or made lighting recommendations.

270
00:30:39,523 --> 00:30:43,567
It's a little bit outside of the scope that we had.

271
00:30:43,947 --> 00:30:44,187
Yeah.

272
00:30:44,488 --> 00:30:45,909
We haven't seen the lighting layout.

273
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:48,811
We certainly can take a look at that.

274
00:30:52,335 --> 00:30:54,616
Mr. Chair, if I may on that question.

275
00:30:55,016 --> 00:30:56,657
Sure, please go ahead.

276
00:30:56,737 --> 00:30:59,419
And just for the record, Pat Gallagher with Goulston and Stores.

277
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:06,783
I think I did see Mr. Bomer on actually, but that is something that we did cover.

278
00:31:06,903 --> 00:31:19,449
And I think, and Pat, you can confirm this, but I think the plan that we showed at the previous hearing shows that no light will extend onto any other properties.

279
00:31:21,592 --> 00:31:22,613
off of our property.

280
00:31:23,394 --> 00:31:30,903
But I think that's something that, and would ask Pat and Mr. Bomer to confirm that for me as well.

281
00:31:33,576 --> 00:31:42,625
I can jump in just briefly and we are passing the ball around here a little bit, but I will actually just try to stop the buck with the bowler team.

282
00:31:42,645 --> 00:31:49,853
I can confirm a photometrics plan was included as a part of the civil design submission.

283
00:31:50,514 --> 00:31:50,894
So I, my

284
00:31:53,977 --> 00:32:01,525
My expectation and understanding was that that was the design scope that it was contained within.

285
00:32:01,565 --> 00:32:06,470
It was not, saying that to say, it was not performed by Cube 3, the architect of record.

286
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:10,534
It was performed within the landscape and civil design scope.

287
00:32:10,654 --> 00:32:14,759
So within the plan set that was submitted of a site photometrics,

288
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:41,181
plan was a part of that and I am not an expert in reading those plans but as I understand it and my takeaway from that plan was as Pat said that the light generated by the site lighting and the photometrics plan that was studied shows that the lighting does not extend to the adjacent

289
00:32:42,662 --> 00:32:44,144
residences in the neighborhood.

290
00:32:45,105 --> 00:32:46,186
So I will stop there.

291
00:32:46,666 --> 00:32:54,053
Steve, if you want to just also confirm what I'm saying, but that is my understanding of what was provided and what the takeaway was.

292
00:32:54,374 --> 00:32:56,095
Yeah, just two quick additional thoughts.

293
00:32:56,135 --> 00:32:57,357
What Pat said is correct.

294
00:32:58,217 --> 00:33:02,622
The lights are all dark sky compliance and they're downward facing with cutoffs.

295
00:33:03,802 --> 00:33:08,244
So that's how you achieve that no spillover onto the abutting property.

296
00:33:08,264 --> 00:33:15,667
So that's an exterior that took into parking lot lighting, pathway, bollard lights, things of that nature around the site.

297
00:33:15,707 --> 00:33:17,748
So those are all factored into that study.

298
00:33:17,768 --> 00:33:19,329
So they're all downward facing lights.

299
00:33:21,023 --> 00:33:27,886
If I, my chair, I apologize if if that was in the set, I don't recall seeing it in the set that was provided to us.

300
00:33:30,327 --> 00:33:33,688
You can confirm that and we'll certainly review it.

301
00:33:34,508 --> 00:33:36,209
And provide any comments if there are any.

302
00:33:38,237 --> 00:33:39,417
and see if we can coordinate.

303
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:46,839
Like I said, I don't recall seeing it in the set that was provided, but if you can certainly get us a copy, we'll review it.

304
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:47,959
Absolutely.

305
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,240
Yeah, it sounds like a plan.

306
00:33:50,300 --> 00:34:04,443
Yeah, if you could just take a look at it from the description, it doesn't sound like a particularly big risk area with the mitigation measures in place, but I think the board and the public would feel more comfortable

307
00:34:05,574 --> 00:34:08,616
you know, just there was an additional expert set of eyes on it.

308
00:34:08,756 --> 00:34:15,819
And so, yeah, if you could, Dennis can coordinate to make sure you have those plans.

309
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:28,365
And then if you could just review that and provide an update to the board if you do have additional concerns based on the, was it photometric plan?

310
00:34:28,385 --> 00:34:29,066
Was that the term?

311
00:34:29,426 --> 00:34:29,646
Yeah.

312
00:34:29,866 --> 00:34:31,227
Yeah, photometric plan, yeah.

313
00:34:31,973 --> 00:34:32,454
Absolutely.

314
00:34:33,455 --> 00:34:33,656
Great.

315
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:35,318
Thank you on both sides.

316
00:34:37,121 --> 00:34:45,233
And Mr. Chair, if I may, I will just say that, you know, to be clear, this certainly was reviewed.

317
00:34:46,893 --> 00:34:52,254
I know that this was something that Mr. Bowmer had looked at and we had discussed in peer review sessions.

318
00:34:53,314 --> 00:35:02,356
I just don't want to create the impression that the photometric plan was not reviewed and has not had those expert eyes on it.

319
00:35:03,756 --> 00:35:11,358
I also just want to be cognizant of trying to close out questions to the degree that we can at this point in the proceedings.

320
00:35:12,498 --> 00:35:12,938
Understood.

321
00:35:12,978 --> 00:35:13,218
Yeah.

322
00:35:15,054 --> 00:35:18,717
My position as chair is I'm not an expert in many of these areas.

323
00:35:18,797 --> 00:35:32,868
And so I'll just generally look to if it was in the scope of one domain, I just want to make sure that the peer reviewer in that domain has seen it and has an opportunity to respond.

324
00:35:32,908 --> 00:35:39,393
But point taken, I am also aware that Cliff Boehmer did review that.

325
00:35:39,473 --> 00:35:43,035
So yeah, it's, I think,

326
00:35:44,403 --> 00:35:55,605
It's a small enough scope that, um, in the event that there's a, a call out, I think it would be something we could time box discuss in our next meeting.

327
00:35:55,906 --> 00:35:59,866
Um, but maybe, you know, it, it, it sounds appropriate.

328
00:36:00,026 --> 00:36:06,728
And, and so, um, yeah, I just want to make sure that beta has a chance to review it.

329
00:36:07,648 --> 00:36:11,909
Um, in case they do have feedback and I don't really see any way around that.

330
00:36:14,036 --> 00:36:14,376
Understood.

331
00:36:14,557 --> 00:36:15,217
Thank you, Mr. Chair.

332
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,140
All right.

333
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:21,423
Other questions or comments from the board?

334
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:34,436
Seeing none, my thought is we'll open public comment twice.

335
00:36:38,293 --> 00:36:40,773
Yeah, we'll open public comment twice.

336
00:36:41,554 --> 00:36:46,034
So we'll do it on the civil portion only.

337
00:36:46,494 --> 00:36:49,235
So if you have a traffic concern, we'll reopen.

338
00:36:53,196 --> 00:37:04,077
And yeah, so chair awaits a motion to open public comment on the civil peer review letter and responses.

339
00:37:05,618 --> 00:37:07,218
Do I have a second?

340
00:37:10,638 --> 00:37:14,039
All right, we're going to take a roll call.

341
00:37:14,759 --> 00:37:15,279
Jamie?

342
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,020
Aye.

343
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:17,440
Andre?

344
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:18,160
Aye.

345
00:37:19,141 --> 00:37:19,621
Jim?

346
00:37:20,341 --> 00:37:20,461
Aye.

347
00:37:21,261 --> 00:37:21,721
Chris?

348
00:37:22,742 --> 00:37:22,922
Aye.

349
00:37:24,042 --> 00:37:24,322
Mike?

350
00:37:24,702 --> 00:37:24,882
Aye.

351
00:37:26,783 --> 00:37:33,685
All right, members of the public, if you would like to speak on anything related to the

352
00:37:34,762 --> 00:37:42,530
civil peer review letter or the responses to it, now is the time to do so.

353
00:37:42,751 --> 00:37:45,073
You can raise your hand on Zoom.

354
00:37:45,113 --> 00:37:47,255
You can turn on your camera and raise your hand.

355
00:37:47,936 --> 00:37:49,157
You can type in chat.

356
00:37:50,058 --> 00:37:53,382
You can email Dennis dmcdougall at medford-ma.gov.

357
00:38:04,982 --> 00:38:09,444
All right, I see a Christina Kach who would like to speak on the matter.

358
00:38:09,564 --> 00:38:11,565
Please state your name and address for the record.

359
00:38:12,385 --> 00:38:14,546
Christina Kach, 130 Myrtle Street.

360
00:38:16,907 --> 00:38:24,570
There continues to be a real emphasis throughout these conversations about the signage we're going to put up.

361
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:25,811
We're going to put up a stop sign.

362
00:38:25,831 --> 00:38:28,352
We're going to put up a you can or can't park here.

363
00:38:29,211 --> 00:38:29,732
et cetera.

364
00:38:31,373 --> 00:38:35,176
I've already mentioned the human factor studies that show that signs are ignored.

365
00:38:36,998 --> 00:38:44,664
Just want to get that on the record again that I've brought up that signs are not the best way to do this.

366
00:38:45,284 --> 00:38:58,155
But what security and public safety measures are you going to put in place for the residents on Myrtle and Amaranth as well as your own tenants in the unit

367
00:38:59,081 --> 00:39:04,243
for the speed limit as well as the stop signs.

368
00:39:05,064 --> 00:39:25,752
And I ask because in closed off areas like this, what is going to stop your tenants from not blowing by that stop sign, from not going however fast they want around the property, from not bombing over those speed bumps to get somewhere faster?

369
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:49,137
So again, what are the security and safety measures you're going to be taking to ensure your residents, your tenants are safely coming in and out of the curb cuts and that they are safely transversing the property and pulling out onto Myrtle Street correctly, especially because it's two ways.

370
00:39:50,377 --> 00:39:53,658
So yes, that's what I'm curious about is the safety measures of

371
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:58,222
the adherence to the speed limits, the speed bumps, and the stop signs.

372
00:39:59,883 --> 00:40:07,266
Just so I'm correctly understanding, so you're specifically interested in details on traffic calming measures?

373
00:40:07,566 --> 00:40:08,047
Is that right?

374
00:40:08,767 --> 00:40:09,287
Well, no.

375
00:40:09,367 --> 00:40:20,693
In the civil layout, they were talking about how by adding the impediments of stop signs and speed bumps around the property to ensure that tenants are

376
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:35,183
They're trying to dissuade people from using Myrtle Street, giving people a little, I mean, the fact that they think people are going to figure out it's slower and it takes longer by mere feet, I mean, come on, guys.

377
00:40:36,863 --> 00:40:46,845
So I'm really, I am concerned about the human nature of once they've entered the property that these speed bumps and stop signs and speed limits

378
00:40:48,258 --> 00:40:50,699
How are you going to ensure that they're working?

379
00:40:50,879 --> 00:40:59,320
Are you going to put cameras up to capture the license plates so you can fine the residents for not stopping at the stop sign?

380
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:02,101
Are you going to fine them for not going the speed limit?

381
00:41:02,121 --> 00:41:05,741
I mean, that's a pretty good straightaway that people can still fly over.

382
00:41:05,761 --> 00:41:13,883
And we're talking about pedestrians as part of this conversation, of the civil engineering layout, and

383
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:18,570
Are there crosswalks there in the property for people to go?

384
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:25,074
I mean, I'm concerned about safety as part of that, the speed bumps and the stop signs and the speed limit and the adherence.

385
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:26,576
I see.

386
00:41:26,676 --> 00:41:26,936
Okay.

387
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:43,448
So basically what I'm hearing is you have general concerns about the adequacy of some of the traffic calming measures and that you'd like additional details whether there are other traffic calming measures that

388
00:41:44,898 --> 00:42:00,871
are being considered to avoid this and whether there's any planned additional safety equipment and or procedures to enforce the safe use of that space.

389
00:42:01,092 --> 00:42:08,978
And then also you want clarification on any locations for internal crosswalks.

390
00:42:09,419 --> 00:42:10,039
Did I get that right?

391
00:42:12,621 --> 00:42:12,801
Yes.

392
00:42:14,325 --> 00:42:16,311
Great, thank you.

393
00:42:16,893 --> 00:42:19,862
Would anyone like to speak to that for the proponent?

394
00:42:21,908 --> 00:42:27,432
Sure, I can talk to her and Pat, if you have anything additional, feel free to jump in.

395
00:42:27,852 --> 00:42:48,507
So to the question, we think the primary reason folks would be dissuaded, and by all means, we heard this comment before, and that's why we've been studying it so closely, but we think the primary is just the longer route and the more circuitous route.

396
00:42:49,527 --> 00:42:59,094
We did add those enhancements, which is cobblestones or some type of bumpier pavements through the turnaround area.

397
00:43:01,899 --> 00:43:05,061
that's pretty effective in slowing folks down.

398
00:43:05,121 --> 00:43:09,625
You notice when your tires hit something that's not smooth asphalt.

399
00:43:09,766 --> 00:43:13,549
So that's a physical improvement that we find is very effective.

400
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:16,572
Stop signs are pretty effective.

401
00:43:16,612 --> 00:43:22,357
I think most people stop at those, whether it's in a parking lot or on a public way, for good reason.

402
00:43:22,397 --> 00:43:25,680
They're there to make sure for that driver's safety.

403
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:27,561
So I think people do respect that.

404
00:43:28,462 --> 00:43:36,246
maybe the speed limit is one that some folks, most folks we think will pay attention to it and drive slower.

405
00:43:37,066 --> 00:43:37,586
Do they drive 10?

406
00:43:38,607 --> 00:43:39,047
Maybe not.

407
00:43:39,167 --> 00:43:45,090
Maybe they're going 15, but they're not doing 30 generally when you put those signs up.

408
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:52,354
So it's really, we don't think any one is the key to reducing the traffic there.

409
00:43:52,874 --> 00:43:54,895
It's the combination of all these things.

410
00:43:54,935 --> 00:43:56,616
So maybe they ignore

411
00:43:57,356 --> 00:44:01,780
a speed limit sign, but they won't ignore the bumpiness of the tires driving through there.

412
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:09,747
They won't ignore the stop sign and they won't ignore the fact that it's just longer and more curvy route.

413
00:44:10,607 --> 00:44:20,476
We think that physical piece of the curviness and the length is the primary, but we've layered on some additional measures that we think are pretty effective for most people.

414
00:44:20,696 --> 00:44:22,777
We get some people ignore

415
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,202
you know, advisory signs.

416
00:44:26,763 --> 00:44:28,866
But we find them pretty effective.

417
00:44:28,946 --> 00:44:41,399
And then on the pedestrian side, we have shown slides in the past, we really are driving the pedestrians out to Myrtle Street onto the sidewalk, which is a very typical crossing of any driveway.

418
00:44:43,261 --> 00:44:49,969
which will be up at sidewalk grade, which really, again, slows people coming in and out down and gives the priority to the pedestrians.

419
00:44:50,569 --> 00:44:52,552
So we have looked at pedestrian crossings.

420
00:44:52,612 --> 00:44:59,860
We've tried to put them in smart places, in places that drivers look for pedestrians crossing.

421
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:01,141
We don't have them crossing

422
00:45:02,443 --> 00:45:13,490
In the middle of a straightaway, we put them at intersections, at highly visible spots, at places where vehicles traditionally slow down.

423
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:15,251
You slow down if you're making the turn in.

424
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:17,913
You slow down if you're coming to a T-intersection.

425
00:45:19,534 --> 00:45:21,235
that's pretty natural habits.

426
00:45:22,015 --> 00:45:28,918
And that's DOT's guidance and any roadway guidance is to put them at those key locations.

427
00:45:28,958 --> 00:45:30,899
So we're not taking that lightly.

428
00:45:31,139 --> 00:45:34,900
Safety is, obviously I'm a professional engineer in the state of Massachusetts.

429
00:45:35,301 --> 00:45:39,482
If I take safety risks, that's a risk to my license.

430
00:45:39,502 --> 00:45:45,405
So I'm very personally focused on that as well as we've heard the comments on this project.

431
00:45:46,225 --> 00:45:55,791
I don't know if Pat has anything to add to that, but it's a great comment, and it's directly led to this additional study and layering of measures.

432
00:45:57,592 --> 00:46:04,856
Well, as another flight engineer in Massachusetts, then you understand that I am also coming from a place of doing my due diligence.

433
00:46:06,397 --> 00:46:09,399
I'm just going to ask that we try to limit crosstalk.

434
00:46:09,819 --> 00:46:11,400
I'll try to make sure everyone gets called on.

435
00:46:12,737 --> 00:46:14,839
Um, uh, Pat, please go ahead.

436
00:46:15,679 --> 00:46:16,240
Sure.

437
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:21,763
Um, I will just try to close out and maybe respond to another element of your question.

438
00:46:22,204 --> 00:46:28,068
Um, uh, specific to just the site, uh, site safety and monitoring.

439
00:46:28,568 --> 00:46:36,974
So the building will have, um, a security system that includes, uh, that includes cameras throughout the exterior of the building.

440
00:46:37,715 --> 00:46:37,795
Um,

441
00:46:38,636 --> 00:46:41,858
as well as the interior for common areas.

442
00:46:42,779 --> 00:46:48,665
That security system is not monitored 24-7.

443
00:46:48,825 --> 00:46:51,467
It's a security system for the property management team.

444
00:46:51,888 --> 00:46:57,113
There are cameras that can be referred to, there are cameras that can be viewed on an as-needed basis.

445
00:46:58,393 --> 00:47:17,779
The way that leases are typically done for these buildings leaves the property manager the ability to terminate leases if residents are habitually violating the rules of the property.

446
00:47:19,439 --> 00:47:25,801
In the instance that I think you are describing where a resident of the building is

447
00:47:26,741 --> 00:47:42,752
deliberately and intentionally operating their vehicle in a manner that it violates public safety measures and puts neighbors and residents at risk.

448
00:47:43,453 --> 00:47:49,077
Those would be instances where there would be grounds for termination of leases if that is something that is happening.

449
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:52,860
something that is observed and something that is happening on a regular basis.

450
00:47:54,302 --> 00:48:01,328
Will there be someone specifically monitoring the camera to know every time someone rolls through a stop sign or violates the speed limit?

451
00:48:01,708 --> 00:48:07,634
The answer to that question would be no, but to the extent that the property management team is made aware of

452
00:48:08,174 --> 00:48:13,176
issues that you are describing to the severity where people are put in danger and at risk.

453
00:48:13,596 --> 00:48:28,001
If there are complaints filed or things like that tend to be, there tends to be a notification process, then that would be the type of situation where a property management team would be allowed to step in and address that with the residents.

454
00:48:28,021 --> 00:48:29,602
So understanding

455
00:48:30,162 --> 00:48:38,968
to the point that you made at the outset of your comment, there are significant human factors when considering things like this.

456
00:48:39,588 --> 00:48:42,110
You can't necessarily control for those.

457
00:48:42,891 --> 00:48:47,194
That goes the same way for public roadways as well.

458
00:48:47,434 --> 00:48:54,939
I think guaranteeing that people stop at stop signs and observe the speed limit anywhere is a questionable assumption to make.

459
00:48:55,339 --> 00:48:59,702
But it would be the intention of our property management team to make sure that

460
00:49:00,102 --> 00:49:13,990
the residents of the neighborhood and the people that occupy the building do so in a safe manner and respect the rules and regulations of the site, which would include the traffic measures that are implemented on the site to observe them as they have been implemented.

461
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:21,435
So hopefully that helps answer that question from a site safety and management perspective.

462
00:49:24,316 --> 00:49:25,157
Great, thank you.

463
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:30,788
Do we have other members of the public that would like to speak on this matter?

464
00:49:40,632 --> 00:49:52,536
Seeing none, Chair awaits a motion to close public comment on the site civil peer review letter and responses.

465
00:49:53,296 --> 00:49:53,616
So moved.

466
00:49:53,636 --> 00:49:55,177
Do we have a second?

467
00:49:55,757 --> 00:49:56,077
Second.

468
00:49:57,131 --> 00:49:58,672
All right, we're going to take a roll call.

469
00:49:59,392 --> 00:49:59,952
Jamie?

470
00:50:00,572 --> 00:50:00,672
Aye.

471
00:50:01,493 --> 00:50:01,973
Andre?

472
00:50:01,993 --> 00:50:02,813
Aye.

473
00:50:03,553 --> 00:50:03,974
Jim?

474
00:50:04,774 --> 00:50:04,914
Aye.

475
00:50:05,554 --> 00:50:05,974
Chris?

476
00:50:07,135 --> 00:50:07,275
Aye.

477
00:50:07,975 --> 00:50:08,275
Mike?

478
00:50:08,975 --> 00:50:09,156
Aye.

479
00:50:10,196 --> 00:50:10,576
All right.

480
00:50:12,437 --> 00:50:20,320
So that's, I guess I'll just, I'll double check with the board if there are additional questions on the civil before we move on to traffic.

481
00:50:22,461 --> 00:50:23,541
Any additional questions?

482
00:50:27,547 --> 00:50:29,788
All right, let's move on to traffic then.

483
00:50:35,932 --> 00:50:37,753
Mr. Chairman, members of the board, thank you.

484
00:50:38,433 --> 00:50:46,158
Scott Thornton with Van Essen Associates here to present our update on the transportation review for the project.

485
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:51,601
Steve, I assume you're going to continue to flip slides, so that's great.

486
00:50:51,641 --> 00:50:52,002
Thank you.

487
00:50:52,542 --> 00:50:53,242
Happy to do so.

488
00:50:57,007 --> 00:51:15,006
So the format for this presentation really is intended to respond to Beta's presentation at the last CBA meeting, rather than respond, as Pat had indicated,

489
00:51:16,447 --> 00:51:29,939
rather than respond to all 80 comments that were contained in that peer review, we've provided responses to the items that were mentioned in Beta's presentation.

490
00:51:30,779 --> 00:51:42,649
And these include discussions of the study area, traffic volume, safety, trip generation, traffic increases, parking, intersection, capacity and operations.

491
00:51:43,390 --> 00:51:51,315
TDM plan, mitigations, and other comments that were provided by members of the ZBA.

492
00:51:52,817 --> 00:51:57,560
So moving into the study area on this slide.

493
00:51:59,621 --> 00:52:11,704
What we've what we noted in the review was that beta generally agreed with the study area, but still requested discussion of the intersection of 4th street with fells way.

494
00:52:12,704 --> 00:52:19,706
And our response to that is that the traffic study area was mapped out in discussions with.

495
00:52:20,526 --> 00:52:27,708
uh, the City of Medford Traffic and Transportation Director, uh, in the Office of Community Development.

496
00:52:28,328 --> 00:52:41,411
And, uh, so we feel confident that this study area is comprehensive and addresses the concerns of city staff in identifying traffic impacts for the project.

497
00:52:42,271 --> 00:52:48,373
Uh, in terms of 4th Street, uh, where it intersects Felsway, uh, it's one way, um,

498
00:52:50,473 --> 00:52:55,214
into the intersection or into Fells Way on both the eastbound and the westbound side.

499
00:52:55,834 --> 00:53:06,337
There is a median at the Fells Way at this location, so traffic is not able to cross the Fells Way here.

500
00:53:07,957 --> 00:53:13,819
We don't really anticipate any traffic using 4th Street for the development.

501
00:53:14,719 --> 00:53:18,520
All the traffic would be on Fells Way at this location.

502
00:53:20,081 --> 00:53:29,730
So, basically due to minimal project impact at this location, the intersection was not included in the study area.

503
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:34,783
I think the next slide we go into is traffic volumes.

504
00:53:36,024 --> 00:53:46,111
Beta had requested that we verify if the counts that were conducted on January 11th of this year were influenced by the holiday on January 15th.

505
00:53:46,292 --> 00:53:52,857
And also there were some other comments about a snow emergency that occurred earlier in the week.

506
00:53:54,799 --> 00:54:02,628
So, we looked at some continuous count station data, both on 93 and on route 1.

507
00:54:03,169 --> 00:54:11,198
And what we determined was that the traffic levels in this area during the count week were higher than those of a typical.

508
00:54:11,879 --> 00:54:23,817
non-holiday week in January, and we have the charts of the daily traffic on the Thursdays that the counts were conducted, and you can see that they're pretty

509
00:54:28,323 --> 00:54:33,727
representative of a typical Thursday during that time period.

510
00:54:34,287 --> 00:54:44,654
The January counts were also adjusted by 1% to bring them up to average month conditions in keeping with standard DOT methodology.

511
00:54:46,454 --> 00:55:00,159
And although there was, I think we might have made some reference to this, that although there was a snow emergency earlier in the week, that snow was generally gone by Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.

512
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:09,182
And the image that's shown in the upper left corner is from the count camera looking at Fells Way.

513
00:55:10,182 --> 00:55:16,864
And you can see there's no evidence of any snow or ice accumulation or anything.

514
00:55:18,305 --> 00:55:27,468
So, based on this data, we feel that the January 11th traffic volumes are reliable and represent typical traffic conditions for the area.

515
00:55:29,767 --> 00:55:45,275
So this slide looks at a response to the comment related to trucks and trip generation of trucks that may have been recorded in the counts of the existing site.

516
00:55:46,836 --> 00:55:58,002
As had been indicated, I think, during earlier traffic presentations and also discussions with Beta, you know, there were trucks that were observed on site.

517
00:56:00,763 --> 00:56:01,463
multiple times.

518
00:56:02,724 --> 00:56:16,131
There were, however, there were no trucks, no truck trips that were recorded in the peak period traffic counts from seven to nine in the morning and four to six in the evening.

519
00:56:20,933 --> 00:56:28,576
Beta had taken some photos of trucks that were parked on site during their field visit.

520
00:56:29,276 --> 00:56:40,040
Those trucks were confirmed by the management company to be associated with a tenant that provides meeting event

521
00:56:42,481 --> 00:56:47,823
services and setup, and those were not associated with the storage facility.

522
00:56:48,363 --> 00:57:04,528
So the other information is related specifically to the trip generation from the driveway counts that was observed, and of the four driveways that were counted, two were assumed to be

523
00:57:06,228 --> 00:57:17,211
directing traffic for the extra space storage site, and the other two were assumed to be generating traffic for the existing industrial building.

524
00:57:17,852 --> 00:57:27,134
So the values that are in the peak hours in the shaded rows represent actual counts, but the data that's

525
00:57:29,435 --> 00:57:39,662
for the daily time period was estimated using ITE and a proportion of what was observed to what would be calculated using ITE.

526
00:57:41,850 --> 00:57:53,814
The next slide we go into safety and Beta had requested that information be provided on pedestrian and bicycle involvement in the crash data.

527
00:57:54,854 --> 00:57:59,155
And this is for the period from 2016 through 2020.

528
00:57:59,955 --> 00:58:05,157
That was the data that was available at the time that the traffic study was prepared.

529
00:58:05,737 --> 00:58:17,364
I think last month, the state released the 2021 data for use, so that could now be used, but it was not available at the time of the study preparation.

530
00:58:19,365 --> 00:58:30,512
And as far as crashes involving pedestrians and bicyclists, there were two crashes involving pedestrians at the Felsway-Central Avenue-Metford Street intersection.

531
00:58:31,572 --> 00:58:42,100
and two crashes involving bicycles, one at the Central Ave and Spring Street intersection and the other at the Riverside Ave and Spring Street intersection.

532
00:58:43,261 --> 00:58:54,170
So in terms of pedestrian and bicycle involvement within the total database, it's a relatively small

533
00:58:54,850 --> 00:59:03,336
component of crashes, but it you know the fact is that those those crashes did occur and they were reported in the database.

534
00:59:04,176 --> 00:59:13,863
No pedestrians or cyclists crashes were involved or were identified at at the other the other 11 locations in the study area.

535
00:59:14,523 --> 00:59:29,612
And then we also looked at crashes along the road sections, specifically along Riverside Avenue and along Fells way, because that was that was another area that beta was concerned with.

536
00:59:29,993 --> 00:59:30,193
And.

537
00:59:32,014 --> 00:59:33,134
In those cases.

538
00:59:34,422 --> 00:59:43,206
Along Riverside Avenue between Felsway and commercial street, there was 1 crash that involved the bicycle on Felsway between Riverside and 2nd streets.

539
00:59:43,826 --> 00:59:46,687
There was and that's that's in both directions.

540
00:59:46,747 --> 00:59:48,948
There was 1 crash involving a bicycle.

541
00:59:48,968 --> 00:59:51,549
4 crashes involving pedestrians.

542
00:59:52,469 --> 00:59:56,191
On Felsway from 2nd street up to Myrtle street.

543
00:59:56,711 --> 01:00:10,440
There was one crash involving a bicyclist and two crashes involving pedestrians, and that's the limit of the crashes on the road sections that showed up in the database.

544
01:00:13,265 --> 01:00:17,749
There was also a question about the trip generation.

545
01:00:18,510 --> 01:00:29,039
Had we used a less aggressive bicycle mode, future bicycle mode for the project?

546
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:30,140
We had

547
01:00:31,952 --> 01:00:42,906
Estimated, I think the census data had indicated a 1% bicycle mode share for existing residents in the area.

548
01:00:44,769 --> 01:00:48,694
As was owing to the bike lanes that are

549
01:00:49,515 --> 01:01:04,765
Present on fells way, and the potential Wellington connector road or multi use path adjacent to the site and the blue bike station and the provision of bike parking on site.

550
01:01:05,205 --> 01:01:08,947
We had expected or anticipated a higher.

551
01:01:10,188 --> 01:01:11,569
Bicycle mode share of 5%.

552
01:01:14,131 --> 01:01:27,177
Beta requested a review of the trip generation to see what would happen if something more like a 2% bicycle mode share was used.

553
01:01:27,538 --> 01:01:37,503
So basically, the 77% vehicle trip mode share that was used in the study would change to 80%, basically moving 3% of

554
01:01:39,964 --> 01:01:44,205
of the trips from the bicycle mode to the vehicle mode.

555
01:01:45,745 --> 01:02:03,269
In terms of the net results in trip generation, it works out to be 40 trips over the course of a day, but two trips during the morning period and two trips during the evening peak hours.

556
01:02:03,569 --> 01:02:06,670
So really a minimal effect from that.

557
01:02:09,050 --> 01:02:13,655
from that change to the in the reduction of the bicycle mode.

558
01:02:13,856 --> 01:02:28,412
And I think the other thing that's important to note is that that 77 percent assumes or really neglects a number of or a portion of the census data for

559
01:02:30,273 --> 01:02:36,479
people that were, or commuters that work from home and walked.

560
01:02:37,059 --> 01:02:47,348
So that's 77% is actually including 12% of people that would not even be commuting using vehicles.

561
01:02:47,789 --> 01:02:54,475
But that's just the nature of providing a conservative analysis in this case.

562
01:02:56,095 --> 01:03:00,658
So the next slide goes into project traffic increases.

563
01:03:01,958 --> 01:03:22,990
We had, you know, as is typical in a standard traffic analysis, we, you know, it's assumed or implied that higher traffic increases are within the study area, but we typically report on traffic increases external to the study area.

564
01:03:24,330 --> 01:03:33,773
But in this case, Beta had requested that we identify the traffic increases due to the project on neighborhood streets closest to the site.

565
01:03:34,373 --> 01:03:50,317
So the numbers that are shown are the volume increases during the morning peak hour, which, again, based on the traffic counts, is generally between 7.30 and 8.30 in the morning, and the evening peak hour,

566
01:03:54,502 --> 01:04:06,339
And, you know, you can see that in some cases where we're looking at 6 to 17 vehicles, for instance, on Lawrence Street, on Myrtle Street.

567
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:11,861
East of Spring Street, we're looking at 4 to 27 vehicles.

568
01:04:12,422 --> 01:04:16,823
The highest increases are realized or expected on Felsway.

569
01:04:16,863 --> 01:04:23,405
That's where we have the 20 to 53 vehicles during the morning and the evening time periods.

570
01:04:24,025 --> 01:04:30,587
And then south of Myrtle Street on Felsway, we're expecting more like 47 or 38 to 47 vehicles during those respective

571
01:04:36,008 --> 01:04:39,750
evening and morning time periods.

572
01:04:40,150 --> 01:04:56,999
So the thing with the traffic analysis is that it's not just the volume increases, it's also the fact that the operation is really dictated by the delays that occur at the intersections.

573
01:04:57,879 --> 01:05:22,860
And the traffic analysis indicated really that there was only one location where the level of service was dropping from, I think, from B to C. And at the other locations, level of service was generally preserved, which indicated that these intersections and the streets, therefore, would have the capacity to accommodate the increases from the project.

574
01:05:24,656 --> 01:05:40,963
The next slide, we looked at the project parking situation and Beta had requested that we provide information on the adequacy of the proposed parking for the project.

575
01:05:41,583 --> 01:05:47,026
And we had reached out to a property manager,

576
01:05:47,926 --> 01:05:54,648
In Malden, looking for some specific utilization data, and that data was not available.

577
01:05:55,368 --> 01:06:06,711
So we did look at the perfect fit parking report that's been released by Metropolitan Area Planning Commission, and we looked at a total of 10 sites.

578
01:06:08,571 --> 01:06:10,692
in the vicinity of the project site.

579
01:06:11,393 --> 01:06:22,899
And these sites were generally chosen because they were similar, they were in a similar situation or a similar setting as the proposed project.

580
01:06:23,019 --> 01:06:32,664
So they were near transit, but in some cases on a bus line, but not always on a bus line.

581
01:06:33,785 --> 01:06:36,587
They weren't adjacent to the orange line.

582
01:06:38,308 --> 01:06:53,520
And we also wanted to include a couple of the sites for Medford because they would be somewhat suitable comps because they're in the same city.

583
01:06:54,821 --> 01:06:57,724
There were only three sites that were in the perfect fit parking

584
01:07:00,606 --> 01:07:04,270
report that were in Medford.

585
01:07:05,791 --> 01:07:12,017
One of those sites is the station landing, which is right at Wellington Station, so he didn't think that was appropriate.

586
01:07:13,098 --> 01:07:19,764
But the other sites, you know, there's one just barely over the border in Everett, most of them are in Malden,

587
01:07:21,105 --> 01:07:32,072
And then the 2 sites in Medford, what this what this data indicated is that there's a parking demand of about 0.89 spaces per unit based on that report.

588
01:07:33,493 --> 01:07:39,618
In that case, the parking ratio of 1.12 spaces per unit that's proposed with the site.

589
01:07:40,458 --> 01:07:54,669
Generally aligns with the demand rates at some of these other other facilities and and we feel that sufficient on site parking will exist to accommodate both the residents and the visitors.

590
01:07:56,090 --> 01:07:57,970
on-site at any given time.

591
01:07:58,210 --> 01:08:11,753
Spaces aren't being dedicated or allocated, so they're not being reserved for use, with the exception of some of the accessible spaces.

592
01:08:12,293 --> 01:08:20,075
But in general, we feel that there's sufficient parking that'll be provided for the residents and visitors with this project.

593
01:08:21,897 --> 01:08:26,340
The next slide goes into capacity analysis.

594
01:08:28,021 --> 01:08:37,166
Beta had indicated intersection delay increases at the intersection of Felsway with Central Ave and Medford Street as a result of the project.

595
01:08:38,227 --> 01:08:45,051
The intersection is actually operating with level of service F delays under existing conditions.

596
01:08:46,232 --> 01:08:49,254
Again, that's not a condition that's caused by the project.

597
01:08:51,595 --> 01:08:59,440
And given the project's permitting status under 40B, it's not responsible to address existing deficiencies.

598
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:05,764
That said, in terms of the increases, really there's an increase in

599
01:09:06,524 --> 01:09:13,490
Primarily on one approach to the intersection, but, you know, and that approach the project is generally adding.

600
01:09:13,510 --> 01:09:18,794
1 to 3 vehicles to the maximum vehicle queue during the either the.

601
01:09:20,015 --> 01:09:28,662
Or the PM peak hour, so it's, it's not really a significant impact due to the project.

602
01:09:29,425 --> 01:09:34,208
But that leads us into the discussion of mitigation.

603
01:09:35,809 --> 01:09:49,758
And, you know, the project is proposing a TDM plan, and Beta requested some clarification on some of the items proposed in the TDM plan.

604
01:09:51,099 --> 01:09:56,463
There will be a separate additional fee for parking spaces.

605
01:09:57,623 --> 01:09:59,545
So, parking will be bundled.

606
01:10:00,305 --> 01:10:10,191
There's secure parking for 100 bicycles with outlets for charging electric bicycles in that bicycle room.

607
01:10:11,172 --> 01:10:23,180
As part of the project, a blue bike station with 10 docks is proposed at the site entrance on Felsway, and the project team has been in discussion with Blue Bikes

608
01:10:23,780 --> 01:10:27,582
and lift on setting up that facility.

609
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:38,929
In terms of other improvements, the MBTA bus shelter will be upgraded, the existing one at the intersection of Felsway and Myrtle Street.

610
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:52,217
The existing shelter will be removed and a new modern shelter will be installed located just south of the proposed Felsway driveway to the site.

611
01:10:53,657 --> 01:10:59,280
there is still ongoing coordination with the MBTA by the project applicant.

612
01:11:00,121 --> 01:11:21,092
As has been discussed previously, the applicant will submit a construction management plan following all state and federal and local guidelines and will be developed in coordination with DPW Transportation Division and also emergency response personnel for the City of Medford.

613
01:11:22,632 --> 01:11:30,496
And as has also been discussed, a wayfinding signage plan will be developed as part of the project.

614
01:11:32,256 --> 01:11:40,260
It's something that has actually been requested by CBA members.

615
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:48,763
I think Steve had identified some of the tenets or measures of the wayfinding plan.

616
01:11:50,891 --> 01:11:56,193
But those items will be proposed as part of the project.

617
01:11:57,134 --> 01:12:00,375
Some additional mitigation that has been discussed.

618
01:12:01,576 --> 01:12:04,697
With regard to local roads jurisdiction,

619
01:12:07,361 --> 01:12:23,069
With respect to any recommended improvements that address pre-existing conditions and are not a result of the proposed project, the applicant is committed to discussions with the City regarding future off-site improvements in the area.

620
01:12:23,650 --> 01:12:24,650
With regard to DCR

621
01:12:27,191 --> 01:12:36,576
jurisdiction, jurisdictional locations, specifically Felsway at Riverside and Felsway at Central Ave and Medford Street.

622
01:12:37,116 --> 01:12:50,462
In terms of the signal optimization there, that's something that Beta had indicated may be something to consider and an optimization of the timing is considered feasible.

623
01:12:52,143 --> 01:13:09,661
In general, the way DCR and MassDOT for that matter consider changes to or prioritization on signal timing is to prioritize the state road facility and

624
01:13:13,757 --> 01:13:34,678
And if we were to move time, move some, say, green time away from the state facility to the side streets that are under town jurisdiction, it's just something that would need to be approved and considered with DCR, because it could conflict with our standard policy.

625
01:13:35,599 --> 01:13:52,091
As far as the fells way at myrtle street of installation of a rectangular rapid flash beacon are FB that's a push button flashing system in order to which which works pedestrian operated.

626
01:13:52,711 --> 01:14:00,093
works to encourage yielding behavior for vehicles when approaching crosswalk.

627
01:14:00,733 --> 01:14:14,277
Project applicant plans to discuss the addition of an RFB at this crosswalk with DCR and they are prepared to collaborate on implementing the RFB.

628
01:14:16,137 --> 01:14:16,958
In terms of the

629
01:14:19,613 --> 01:14:25,763
The question regarding a potential break in the median at Myrtle Street.

630
01:14:28,233 --> 01:14:48,647
We looked at this from a number of different perspectives, from a vehicle, from a safety perspective for vehicles, for pedestrians, for a potential increase in cut-through traffic moving through the area.

631
01:14:50,608 --> 01:15:10,989
What we had identified was cutting into the median to create or providing a break in the median and then cutting into the median to provide a left turn lane for storage for vehicles making the left turn into Myrtle Street.

632
01:15:13,031 --> 01:15:41,278
would have the negative side effects of eliminating a pedestrian refuge at the crosswalk, where now pedestrians, or without that break, pedestrians are able to cross in a two-stage condition, where they cross the northbound side of Fells Way and then cross the southbound side.

633
01:15:43,298 --> 01:15:49,163
This type of break would eliminate that refuge because that.

634
01:15:50,004 --> 01:15:53,386
Area of the media would be taken up by cars queued up to turn left.

635
01:15:54,908 --> 01:15:57,370
This would also increase conflict points for.

636
01:15:58,090 --> 01:16:04,432
Vehicle to vehicle interaction as you'd be adding another conflict point.

637
01:16:05,153 --> 01:16:15,716
Another few conflict points with vehicles turning left, crossing 2 lanes of traffic at an uncivilized location and all also crossing a.

638
01:16:17,637 --> 01:16:21,421
Crossing a bike lane, so there's that issue.

639
01:16:21,761 --> 01:16:35,552
And then any traffic that might consider or might try to make a U-turn maneuver that with the new bump out that's there on the West side of the Fells Way, it's really

640
01:16:36,874 --> 01:16:46,228
It's really a dicey proposition, and it's not the same width as is that available at the Central Lab intersection or the Riverside intersection.

641
01:16:47,591 --> 01:16:50,936
And we're showing vehicles, we did run some

642
01:16:51,937 --> 01:17:03,739
some turning template checks and the vehicles would pass over the curb line and over the pedestrian bump out.

643
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:06,960
And that's just a regular passenger car.

644
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:14,182
If any trucks were trying to make that maneuver, they physically could not make that without driving up on the bump out.

645
01:17:16,622 --> 01:17:39,416
And then probably the 1, at least 1 of the, if not the biggest issue, at least 1 of the bigger issues is the potential rise and cut through traffic along Myrtle Street and Lawrence Street as as people would be likely trying to avoid any queuing or congestion that exists at the central lab intersection.

646
01:17:39,456 --> 01:17:41,197
We think that if there's a.

647
01:17:42,197 --> 01:17:53,341
If the break is open for traffic to make the left in to Myrtle Street, that's one potential issue.

648
01:17:53,381 --> 01:18:04,405
But then it would become difficult to prevent traffic from making a left turn out from Myrtle into the Fellsway.

649
01:18:06,366 --> 01:18:23,777
But I'm sure that if that break was there, there would be an increase in traffic on Myrtle Street for people both trying to make those types of movements and just trying to avoid central or the congestion at the Felsway and Central intersection.

650
01:18:25,638 --> 01:18:31,462
So for those reasons, we're advising against a break in the median.

651
01:18:33,903 --> 01:18:46,719
And just to further close out the issue with the DCR, we have to have these discussions with them as part of our MEPA review for the project.

652
01:18:48,221 --> 01:18:50,303
The next slide is just a few

653
01:18:51,750 --> 01:19:09,302
close out issues related to comments from the ZBA that had to do with confirming space exists on the bus stopping at Myrtle Street, both inbound and outbound.

654
01:19:11,950 --> 01:19:22,459
So, again, from the ridership data and from observations that we made, it seems like there's plenty of seats available.

655
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:33,348
At the inbound direction, Felsway at Myrtle Street, there were 12 persons on the bus when 3 persons were observed to

656
01:19:40,133 --> 01:19:49,342
To get on the bus that left a total of 15 with a capacity of 53 for the bus.

657
01:19:49,422 --> 01:19:54,507
There's there's plenty of plenty of capacity available.

658
01:19:55,527 --> 01:20:00,272
And then in the outbound directions, a similar story coming into coming into the.

659
01:20:05,451 --> 01:20:11,076
The second street bus stop, there were four riders.

660
01:20:12,758 --> 01:20:26,772
At the Myrtle Street stop, there were 11 riders, so there's still plenty of seats available, both inbound and outbound, on the 100 bus going past the site.

661
01:20:27,673 --> 01:20:48,624
In terms of the neighborhood peak hour, there was some question about the overall traffic volumes, how the peaks were either earlier or I think the anecdotal or the anecdotes indicated that people thought that the peak hours were not between 7 to 9 or 4 to 6.

662
01:20:51,786 --> 01:21:05,942
And this is data from the Felsway that indicates that the hours between 7 and 8 and 4 and 6 are clearly the peak hours of consideration.

663
01:21:06,243 --> 01:21:09,506
And I'm not sure which is which, but one of these is the

664
01:21:10,908 --> 01:21:21,191
Probably the blue lines are the southbound volumes on Felsway and the red lines are the northbound volumes, which would match up with the time periods.

665
01:21:23,101 --> 01:21:33,289
The next slide, really just a few other comments had to do with where the trip generation data comes from based on ITE.

666
01:21:33,449 --> 01:21:35,831
It's recognized as the industry standard.

667
01:21:36,231 --> 01:21:45,679
It's required use for traffic studies that are under review by state agencies like MassDOT and DCR.

668
01:21:47,441 --> 01:21:48,622
The land use code,

669
01:21:49,882 --> 01:21:55,907
For for its land use code 221 for the residential development mid rise.

670
01:21:58,268 --> 01:22:07,735
For which is appropriate for for this site consists of 31 data points and that data goes includes.

671
01:22:09,235 --> 01:22:20,678
counts of actual facilities collected during the 1990s, 2000s, 2010s, and 2020s at the states shown, including Massachusetts.

672
01:22:20,998 --> 01:22:30,780
And this data is continually reviewed by ITE to confirm that it's still appropriate for use.

673
01:22:33,901 --> 01:22:44,624
And any data that is determined to not be appropriate or to have aged out is removed from the database.

674
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:54,687
The information for land use code 215, which is for the townhouses, those sites were surveyed in the 80s, 90s, 2000, 2010s.

675
01:22:57,088 --> 01:23:06,295
Between 46 and 51 data points, the numbers change based on whether we're looking at the, depending on what time period, if it's a daily or the morning or the evening time period.

676
01:23:06,595 --> 01:23:11,980
But you can see Massachusetts is represented in this data set as well.

677
01:23:12,820 --> 01:23:15,783
And then there were some questions about people.

678
01:23:16,183 --> 01:23:17,804
People will move in and out constantly.

679
01:23:17,864 --> 01:23:19,105
How many delivery vehicles?

680
01:23:21,567 --> 01:23:28,650
You know, the data that ITE collects, again, is based on counts of actual facilities.

681
01:23:29,270 --> 01:23:40,995
So, particularly for residential, for multifamily buildings, they observe counts, you know, the counts that are conducted include

682
01:23:41,975 --> 01:23:58,447
things like delivery vehicles and moving vehicles and trash trucks, in addition to the drop-offs of pizza or whatever else is coming in, as well as the resident traffic.

683
01:23:58,907 --> 01:24:06,332
So those types of behaviors are captured in the data and it's all included.

684
01:24:07,833 --> 01:24:11,578
So it's a pretty comprehensive data source.

685
01:24:12,540 --> 01:24:15,303
And I think that's it for traffic.

686
01:24:15,684 --> 01:24:17,186
And I'll be happy to answer any questions.

687
01:24:17,446 --> 01:24:17,707
Thank you.

688
01:24:19,922 --> 01:24:23,885
Mister chairs, if I can just jump in, sorry to close out quickly.

689
01:24:23,905 --> 01:24:39,658
Um, as we, as we obviously cross design disciplines, um, uh, we, there are elements from, from several that, um, uh, it's my responsibility, frankly, to make sure that we are tying together.

690
01:24:39,879 --> 01:24:42,821
There's one mitigation, um,

691
01:24:45,883 --> 01:24:48,184
Or not mitigation, there's 1 public improvement.

692
01:24:48,244 --> 01:24:55,287
I should say that that we are proposing in addition to what was included on the slides that Scott.

693
01:24:57,427 --> 01:24:58,728
Discussed, and I just.

694
01:24:59,168 --> 01:25:03,690
felt compelled and was relevant for me to bring up as well.

695
01:25:04,550 --> 01:25:25,078
With the adjustment of the curbs on Amaranth and Myrtle Street, the slides that Mr. Martirano had presented earlier to clarify quantities of vehicles that could park in the newly dedicated street parking spaces, we are also considering that to be an improvement to the existing conditions.

696
01:25:25,118 --> 01:25:25,218
So

697
01:25:25,558 --> 01:25:51,260
just making sure i just wanted to point that out for the board's reference and consideration as we are outlining elements of the projects that we are currently proposing that are public improvements and then in consideration for future conditions of the project that will improve the public in the neighborhood so just wanting to make sure that that was added for everyone's awareness that

698
01:25:51,840 --> 01:26:06,945
Um, the curb realignment and the dedicated sidewalk space, uh, being on private property is something that, you know, we feel, um, is improving the neighborhood and, um, just wanted to make that, uh, uh, on the record.

699
01:26:06,965 --> 01:26:08,586
All right.

700
01:26:08,666 --> 01:26:09,006
Thank you.

701
01:26:09,026 --> 01:26:14,168
Um, so next I want to check in with Jeff Max-Tutis from Beta Group.

702
01:26:14,808 --> 01:26:19,770
Um, Jeff, I'd love to get your overall take on, um,

703
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:29,830
you know, the what has been presented here, the responses, some of the proposed improvements and so on, and especially any lingering risks you see.

704
01:26:29,850 --> 01:26:31,212
Yeah.

705
01:26:33,298 --> 01:26:35,539
Good evening, Mr. Chair, members of the board.

706
01:26:35,559 --> 01:26:38,980
I want to thank Scott and his team.

707
01:26:39,140 --> 01:26:44,801
I think they provided a lot of information that we asked for in a thorough manner.

708
01:26:46,662 --> 01:26:55,244
We haven't reviewed their letter yet and all the comments that we had, so I'm just responding tonight.

709
01:26:57,405 --> 01:27:02,772
Kind of their, their presentation, and we did, we did speak yesterday and went through this.

710
01:27:02,852 --> 01:27:03,073
So.

711
01:27:03,093 --> 01:27:11,043
Yeah, I'll just go through some of the kind of the high level points or issues.

712
01:27:11,283 --> 01:27:13,746
I think the board still needs to consider.

713
01:27:14,859 --> 01:27:19,067
Um, as far as the intersections, like Scott mentioned.

714
01:27:19,087 --> 01:27:24,017
You know, we have intersections that are under jurisdiction of.

715
01:27:24,377 --> 01:27:27,022
You know, mass mass that or DC.

716
01:27:41,529 --> 01:27:45,892
Um, Jeff, sorry, uh, your connection dropped out.

717
01:27:46,012 --> 01:27:49,514
So you said DCR and then you cut out.

718
01:27:51,475 --> 01:27:52,676
Oh, uh, I'm sorry.

719
01:27:52,696 --> 01:27:53,256
Can you hear me?

720
01:27:53,947 --> 01:27:54,947
Yes, we can hear you now.

721
01:27:54,967 --> 01:27:56,348
Yeah, sorry about that.

722
01:27:57,788 --> 01:28:05,651
Yeah, so there's intersections under DCR, state jurisdiction, and local jurisdiction under the city.

723
01:28:05,771 --> 01:28:09,592
So Felsway is DCR.

724
01:28:10,372 --> 01:28:20,116
The intersections with potential issues are Felsway and Riverside, which is a recognized high crash location.

725
01:28:20,136 --> 01:28:23,177
It's identified as a high crash cluster.

726
01:28:24,017 --> 01:28:38,827
Under MassDOT there have been improvements identified as previous road safety audit for signal optimization at that intersection to help improve safety again under DCR jurisdiction.

727
01:28:39,768 --> 01:28:51,437
Felsway and Central, as Scott had mentioned, operates at level service F, which is a failure in the AM and PM peak hour.

728
01:28:51,817 --> 01:28:55,179
Optimization should be looked at at that intersection.

729
01:28:56,420 --> 01:29:08,649
When the signal is operating at capacity, there's only so much you can do with signal timing, adjusting it from one approach to another, but it should be looked at.

730
01:29:09,630 --> 01:29:22,823
One of the things we also asked was, can the northbound left turn lane on Felsway approaching Central Ave, can that be extended in the future?

731
01:29:22,903 --> 01:29:29,909
Because that lane does get blocked by the queue of the through traffic extending southbound.

732
01:29:31,035 --> 01:29:40,783
If that can be extended, then it would reduce delay for those people wishing to make a left turn or U-turn going back to the project site.

733
01:29:40,943 --> 01:29:44,807
So that's something I think we still want to hear about.

734
01:29:46,100 --> 01:30:02,428
And then at Felsway and Myrtle, as Scott mentioned about the rectangular rapid flashing beacon, we think that's a good idea and should be implemented for safety considerations.

735
01:30:03,489 --> 01:30:09,692
And we agree that the break is probably not beneficial

736
01:30:11,032 --> 01:30:16,074
For both traffic operations and safety at that location.

737
01:30:17,274 --> 01:30:21,795
So, going to intersections under local control.

738
01:30:22,856 --> 01:30:25,876
Central and spring street has a high crash rate.

739
01:30:27,477 --> 01:30:30,398
And also doesn't have any pedestrian signal.

740
01:30:30,458 --> 01:30:30,918
So that's.

741
01:30:32,195 --> 01:30:34,336
That's not a, it's not a capacity issue there.

742
01:30:34,436 --> 01:30:37,098
It's a safety issue at that intersection.

743
01:30:37,118 --> 01:30:43,241
So it's a high crash rate and doesn't have any pedestrian signal facilities, which is something to consider.

744
01:30:43,261 --> 01:30:51,005
And then lastly, and this is the intersection I think Andre asked about Myrtle, Lambeth and Lawrence.

745
01:30:52,057 --> 01:30:54,218
You know, it's an awkward intersection.

746
01:30:54,278 --> 01:30:58,320
It's confusing for motorists and pedestrians.

747
01:30:59,460 --> 01:31:00,661
It's a wide intersection.

748
01:31:02,521 --> 01:31:14,907
So we were, you know, suggesting that that intersection be looked at for improvements to really improve awareness and safety of pedestrians, slow vehicles down.

749
01:31:15,927 --> 01:31:23,390
Things like additional curb extensions to tighten up that intersection, possibly raising the intersection.

750
01:31:23,410 --> 01:31:28,873
It is a wide expanse of pavement with a lot of movements in a close area.

751
01:31:29,883 --> 01:31:54,533
So we think that being located basically right at the project site would benefit not only residents in the neighborhood, but also residents of the proposed project and make that more of a safer condition and make motorists slow down and more aware of pedestrians crossing in that area.

752
01:31:56,681 --> 01:32:00,127
A couple other things, just on parking.

753
01:32:01,270 --> 01:32:07,732
And I know there's not been a parking plan operations or management plan been developed.

754
01:32:08,212 --> 01:32:14,513
And I know that can probably be conditioned if the project moves forward.

755
01:32:15,854 --> 01:32:21,015
But I think the overall parking ratio seems okay.

756
01:32:21,695 --> 01:32:25,696
We just want to make sure that there's enough visitor parking on site.

757
01:32:26,016 --> 01:32:29,437
I think before, I think there was a low number

758
01:32:30,497 --> 01:32:36,144
actual spaces for visitors either short term or long term.

759
01:32:36,184 --> 01:32:41,129
So we want to make sure that that's adequately addressed if the project moves forward.

760
01:32:42,591 --> 01:32:46,115
And then on the transportation demand management, the TDM measures,

761
01:32:47,823 --> 01:32:53,008
We had asked about consideration be given to providing transit.

762
01:32:53,909 --> 01:32:59,073
Passes or subsidies for people using bus or subway.

763
01:32:59,093 --> 01:33:04,238
As a, as a benefit to the residents, so.

764
01:33:04,258 --> 01:33:09,882
I think that's those are kind of the high level.

765
01:33:11,564 --> 01:33:24,572
remaining questions or issues we have, and we may have additional ones to review the entire response to comments document, but that's what I have right now based on the presentation.

766
01:33:24,592 --> 01:33:26,833
All right.

767
01:33:26,973 --> 01:33:28,694
Thank you, Jeff.

768
01:33:28,734 --> 01:33:35,658
With that, I will open it up to questions and comments from the board, whether that's to Jeff or to the proponent.

769
01:33:35,678 --> 01:33:38,820
Who would like to start?

770
01:33:41,733 --> 01:33:43,294
I saw Andre's hand first.

771
01:33:43,654 --> 01:33:44,134
Please go ahead.

772
01:33:45,375 --> 01:33:46,315
Thanks, Jeff.

773
01:33:46,335 --> 01:33:54,439
I appreciate you addressing the, you know, the Lawrence Myrtle Amaranth intersection that I had brought up earlier.

774
01:33:55,379 --> 01:33:56,340
But I just wanted to

775
01:33:57,502 --> 01:34:03,986
try to understand what you're saying because it wasn't clear to me the specific interventions that you were proposing.

776
01:34:05,027 --> 01:34:11,492
It sounded like signage or awareness, but could you elaborate on that a little bit?

777
01:34:12,132 --> 01:34:14,314
Yeah, sure.

778
01:34:15,514 --> 01:34:22,919
Curb extensions or bump-outs is something that can be considered, so they do a few different things.

779
01:34:24,088 --> 01:34:46,295
One is they reduce the crossing distance for pedestrians, and they also make pedestrians more visible to motorists because the curb is extending further out into the roadway where vehicles have better visibility of pedestrians when they want to cross the roadway.

780
01:34:47,283 --> 01:34:53,788
tends to slow traffic down because you're narrowing the lane width in the pavement area.

781
01:34:55,130 --> 01:35:05,058
You know, you have to be concerned when you design those with turning radius and, you know, drainage issues, you know, at the corners.

782
01:35:05,278 --> 01:35:09,101
But, you know, generally those are well-recognized.

783
01:35:09,462 --> 01:35:12,744
I call them horizontal traffic calming measures.

784
01:35:14,954 --> 01:35:18,375
And then we thought, well, can you do a raised intersection?

785
01:35:18,415 --> 01:35:29,201
Raised intersection would be a vertical traffic calming measure where the vehicles actually ramp up for the entire intersection at a reduced speed and travel.

786
01:35:29,381 --> 01:35:32,143
Sometimes you call them speed tables or raised intersections.

787
01:35:33,423 --> 01:35:48,051
So, it reduce the speed in that area, which is a safety benefit for not only pedestrians, but motorists and an intersection that's fairly confusing.

788
01:35:50,193 --> 01:35:50,713
Great, thank you.

789
01:35:53,194 --> 01:36:01,371
I also add to actually just one thing that's a another alternative to that just given that curb extensions and kind of rebuilding the sidewalks.

790
01:36:04,165 --> 01:36:10,652
If that's not feasible in this circumstance, but I'd love to see the city and the developer talk about that to see if they could do it.

791
01:36:11,553 --> 01:36:17,921
If it's not, there are other ways of kind of visually at lower costs doing achieving some of the same results.

792
01:36:18,021 --> 01:36:22,366
A project I was involved with down in in New Bedford was in a.

793
01:36:25,125 --> 01:36:48,150
In a low income area where there was a significant park divided by a busy street from the neighborhood, we worked with artists to create a ground mural around the crossing area that the folks used and provided an opportunity to engage local artists and residents in creating that street mural.

794
01:36:48,250 --> 01:36:49,190
And it was designed

795
01:36:49,890 --> 01:36:54,952
like Portuguese tiles, blue and white, which kind of reinforce the cultural heritage of the area.

796
01:36:55,072 --> 01:36:59,733
So just another thing to take into consideration.

797
01:37:02,214 --> 01:37:13,058
Yeah, if you can have those discussions with DPW department and if they've used those, sometimes we call them tactical urbanism or things like that.

798
01:37:14,158 --> 01:37:19,500
If they've used those type of devices or techniques, that's another option to consider.

799
01:37:23,877 --> 01:37:24,817
All right, thank you.

800
01:37:25,177 --> 01:37:26,078
Jamie, please go ahead.

801
01:37:26,098 --> 01:37:28,098
Thank you, Mike.

802
01:37:29,639 --> 01:37:51,386
On the Lawrence-Myrtle-Gamranth, Jeff, on the bump out, would you see that corner at Lawrence and Myrtle, the rounded corner, as something that would bump out, extending that into the intersection to make it more of a, make each lane section more of a normal width rather, because that seems to be the,

803
01:37:52,324 --> 01:37:56,487
pivot point there where the expansion, why width is the problem?

804
01:37:58,108 --> 01:37:59,829
Yeah, that's right.

805
01:37:59,869 --> 01:38:16,841
We're trying to reduce the width, particularly for pedestrians to make it more comfortable and safe for them to cross and reducing the amount of pavement and width so motorists tend to slow down in that area.

806
01:38:16,861 --> 01:38:21,884
Definitely agree on Spring Street and Central,

807
01:38:22,254 --> 01:38:25,075
that intersection has been a challenge for years.

808
01:38:26,496 --> 01:38:35,799
Anything that the applicant or the city is willing to discuss on that, I would love to see some improvement there.

809
01:38:36,619 --> 01:38:39,881
Additional question on the bus capacity.

810
01:38:40,461 --> 01:38:44,582
Was that measured at the bus stop at the property?

811
01:38:45,142 --> 01:38:51,785
I'm not too concerned about increased capacity, but my thought is downstream as the bus goes to the station,

812
01:38:52,865 --> 01:38:54,967
What's the final capacity at drop-off?

813
01:38:55,567 --> 01:39:05,914
Is there any impact that capacity from this development would delay people downstream from getting to the station?

814
01:39:06,695 --> 01:39:14,721
And from the same aspect, coming back from the station, the capacity of the bus as it leaves the station versus when it arrives at the building.

815
01:39:16,068 --> 01:39:26,167
Yeah, my sense is there aren't any, but I think Scott can probably answer that better than I can.

816
01:39:29,521 --> 01:39:34,446
Yeah, I think we would have to take another look at the data.

817
01:39:34,867 --> 01:39:49,742
I don't believe that, certainly at the next stop down, there were no issues, but we can take another look at it to confirm that that's the case, that there's plenty of capacity.

818
01:39:50,863 --> 01:40:01,393
It does seem like there's just based on observation seems like there's, there's a lot of seats available, but we can, we can check those numbers from the MBTA ridership results.

819
01:40:06,498 --> 01:40:08,440
Other questions or comments from the board.

820
01:40:19,252 --> 01:40:20,753
All right, I'll go next then.

821
01:40:22,434 --> 01:40:29,700
So Jeff, my questions focused on Felsway and Central.

822
01:40:30,660 --> 01:40:45,351
So as you mentioned, it's level of service F. I think Scott was mentioning at the peak hour, it's adding, I think it was up to three cars to that turn lane.

823
01:40:48,088 --> 01:40:54,693
My understanding, correct me if I'm wrong, is you can't do any worse than F in this categorization system.

824
01:40:54,733 --> 01:41:16,989
So what I'm trying to get to an understanding of is, is adding three cars to that F intersection in the peak scenario an impact that's kind of going beyond just the existing condition that needs mitigation?

825
01:41:18,814 --> 01:41:22,476
Yeah, I think that I think that's pretty cars was referring to the queue length.

826
01:41:23,116 --> 01:41:25,577
Yeah, I believe so.

827
01:41:25,617 --> 01:41:26,198
But, um.

828
01:41:27,879 --> 01:41:32,841
Yeah, when an intersections that efforts, it becomes tricky because.

829
01:41:35,395 --> 01:41:40,198
you know, the results become sort of unstable because you're going over capacity.

830
01:41:41,078 --> 01:41:47,262
So you can add a couple cars and see huge increases in delay or queuing at some times.

831
01:41:47,282 --> 01:41:58,369
You know, I believe the increase here is more on Central Avenue because, you know, I think it adds 100 seconds in the a.m.

832
01:41:58,429 --> 01:42:00,270
and 28 seconds in the p.m.

833
01:42:00,330 --> 01:42:01,171
to the intersection.

834
01:42:01,311 --> 01:42:04,713
So, you know, again,

835
01:42:05,662 --> 01:42:10,064
You're adding a relatively moderate amount of increase on that left turn.

836
01:42:10,384 --> 01:42:14,085
It's not a high number, but it will increase delay.

837
01:42:14,105 --> 01:42:20,208
It's not proportional, generally, when that intersection's at capacity.

838
01:42:21,522 --> 01:42:40,213
You know, if it's at F, you're at failure, no matter what you add to an F, it's true, you can't have beyond an F, you can't have a G, but you can have worse delay, you can have worse queuing, can give a volume to capacity ratio over one.

839
01:42:40,453 --> 01:42:47,778
So, you know, the project's gonna have an impact to that intersection, that's gonna have a U-turn, you know,

840
01:42:51,025 --> 01:42:58,249
We'd like the traffic to stay on fells way, because it's the main arterial instead of trying to sequel alternate roads on local streets.

841
01:42:58,309 --> 01:43:00,151
So, you know, to the.

842
01:43:00,731 --> 01:43:12,718
You know, if we can, if we can provide improvements and delay and queuing at that intersection to the extent possible, it's just going to it's going to benefit the project and keep traffic out of the neighborhood.

843
01:43:14,423 --> 01:43:18,806
Okay, and then I just want to make sure I'm more of a visual person.

844
01:43:18,846 --> 01:43:37,879
So apologies if this would be obvious to me, but this whole observation that during the PM peak period, Bellsway northbound through movement at central and Medford Street block vehicles from entering the northbound left turn lane.

845
01:43:40,300 --> 01:43:42,602
So that's

846
01:43:44,797 --> 01:43:52,523
But this is not, yeah, like, could you maybe clarify what exactly is happening there?

847
01:43:54,024 --> 01:43:54,344
Yeah.

848
01:43:54,824 --> 01:43:55,104
Yeah.

849
01:43:55,164 --> 01:44:00,448
So if you have a left turn pocket at an intersection, I don't know the length of it.

850
01:44:00,548 --> 01:44:01,749
It's not that long, right?

851
01:44:01,789 --> 01:44:09,014
But the queue length is fairly long in particularly afternoon, you know, PM, peak period.

852
01:44:09,933 --> 01:44:16,764
And that, that queue going north bound will extend upstream right to.

853
01:44:17,565 --> 01:44:23,535
So, vehicles wanting to make get into that left turn pocket can't can't enter that pocket till the through vehicles clear.

854
01:44:23,555 --> 01:44:24,516
I see.

855
01:44:24,716 --> 01:44:24,917
Okay.

856
01:44:25,725 --> 01:44:30,508
And that happens a lot, you know, in urban areas.

857
01:44:31,148 --> 01:44:39,393
But to the extent if that pocket can be extended, you know, could get them in that pocket earlier.

858
01:44:39,493 --> 01:44:43,656
So, you know, possibly they don't have to wait another cycle to make that left turn.

859
01:44:44,256 --> 01:44:54,262
You know, there may be constraints there with DCR, you know, vegetation or trees or whatnot or physical constraints of the median.

860
01:44:55,082 --> 01:45:00,526
I thought it's at least worth taking a look at to see if it's feasible.

861
01:45:01,187 --> 01:45:01,447
Got it.

862
01:45:01,527 --> 01:45:01,807
Okay.

863
01:45:01,827 --> 01:45:09,392
So extending that left turn pocket is a proposed mitigation to explore for this observation.

864
01:45:10,633 --> 01:45:11,894
We think it should be considered.

865
01:45:11,914 --> 01:45:12,775
Yeah.

866
01:45:12,835 --> 01:45:13,055
Okay.

867
01:45:14,376 --> 01:45:14,596
Okay.

868
01:45:14,636 --> 01:45:15,036
Thank you.

869
01:45:17,158 --> 01:45:20,000
Other questions or comments from the board?

870
01:45:27,555 --> 01:45:33,620
Since we're on traffic, and I know we talked about it earlier about the civil on the long stretch.

871
01:45:34,941 --> 01:45:39,765
On the property, I think where there was a comment made that there would be there are going to be speed bumps.

872
01:45:40,726 --> 01:45:42,748
On property and on long straight stretches.

873
01:45:45,270 --> 01:45:48,172
I'll defer to the applicant for that.

874
01:45:52,699 --> 01:45:54,501
I'll respond if you'd like.

875
01:45:56,903 --> 01:46:00,447
At the time, we don't have speed bumps along that stretch.

876
01:46:00,507 --> 01:46:04,991
We think the head-end parking is the traffic calming along there.

877
01:46:05,912 --> 01:46:08,875
That said, as Pat mentioned earlier, if

878
01:46:12,138 --> 01:46:16,780
They've got maintenance, they've got security staff, they've got cameras.

879
01:46:17,440 --> 01:46:36,047
If they observe that as a common issue they're seeing along that stretch, and it is presenting a problem, there's always the opportunity to bring in speed bumps or some other measures, a raised table that Jeff had mentioned as a potential for the roadway, that that could be a potential along that stretch as well.

880
01:46:36,967 --> 01:46:40,529
At the time, we think the head in parking is the traffic calming measure.

881
01:46:40,609 --> 01:46:43,131
People generally go slower through parking lots.

882
01:46:43,191 --> 01:46:49,735
If it was curved on both sides, straight shot, I think it would be a faster speedway.

883
01:46:51,056 --> 01:46:55,678
But it's definitely something that they'll watch and address if it becomes an issue.

884
01:46:57,219 --> 01:46:57,540
Thank you.

885
01:47:00,902 --> 01:47:03,183
Other questions, comments from the board?

886
01:47:09,193 --> 01:47:17,035
Mister chair would I be able to respond to a couple of the comments that were raised if if there aren't any further questions at this moment.

887
01:47:17,315 --> 01:47:25,157
Before we get too far and and you know don't want to lose focus on a couple of points that I thought it would be important.

888
01:47:27,117 --> 01:47:28,818
To bring this back a little bit.

889
01:47:31,158 --> 01:47:38,300
Particularly on a couple of the intersections that were discussed where the existing condition is challenging.

890
01:47:39,473 --> 01:47:51,739
Um, I, I just, and I'm, I'm using challenging as not a legal or engineering term of art, but I think, I think you all understand, um, that, you know, I, I think.

891
01:47:52,919 --> 01:47:56,941
These are all areas that we have looked at in the course of our analysis.

892
01:47:58,001 --> 01:48:01,823
Um, I think we're going to be willing to continue looking at them.

893
01:48:03,104 --> 01:48:05,925
Um, but I think these are also areas that.

894
01:48:07,476 --> 01:48:20,285
due to the existing condition and the challenges posed today, if there are to be improvements of a certain level, I think they would need to be in partnership with the city.

895
01:48:21,205 --> 01:48:32,173
And I think we're absolutely going to be having those conversations and focusing, for example, on the intersection of Lawrence, Amaranth, and Myrtle.

896
01:48:33,991 --> 01:48:43,883
I think that's an area that already is being improved significantly by the closing off of the curb cut that's on the corner of Amaranth and Myrtle.

897
01:48:44,864 --> 01:48:49,570
And we'll readily acknowledge that that remains a challenging intersection.

898
01:48:50,638 --> 01:48:54,443
Um, and again, I think we're open to having those conversations.

899
01:48:55,304 --> 01:48:58,568
With the city on if there's a solution.

900
01:48:59,409 --> 01:49:03,433
And I appreciate Mr. liver's comments as well on on being open to.

901
01:49:03,453 --> 01:49:09,781
Um, creative solutions and and, um, you know, ways that we can try to.

902
01:49:10,862 --> 01:49:16,265
create a safer intersection that might be a little outside of the box.

903
01:49:16,325 --> 01:49:26,710
I think that's all on the table, but just want to emphasize that I think the city has to be a partner in any of those improvements and in the conversation over that.

904
01:49:26,730 --> 01:49:29,052
I think the city has to be clear.

905
01:49:30,212 --> 01:49:39,377
Attorney Gallagher, just to be clear, I'm not sure I understand from a technical perspective what

906
01:49:40,399 --> 01:49:41,600
partnership looks like?

907
01:49:41,620 --> 01:49:49,449
Like, is it just being willing to meet and discuss or does it mean something more specific than that?

908
01:49:50,650 --> 01:50:02,923
I think it means that depending on the cost of certain improvements, they may be costs that we can't carry on our own because they would make the project not feasible.

909
01:50:03,930 --> 01:50:07,493
So, I think that's the, that's the question and I think.

910
01:50:07,813 --> 01:50:11,997
You know, our whole team is very focused on trying to create a safe.

911
01:50:14,619 --> 01:50:18,262
Roadway network around the project site, but.

912
01:50:19,183 --> 01:50:23,527
We do need to be cognizant of the costs and particularly when we're talking about.

913
01:50:24,388 --> 01:50:25,769
Areas that are today.

914
01:50:27,848 --> 01:50:35,292
you know, in a poor condition as far as intersection, you know, traffic and quality is concerned.

915
01:50:35,912 --> 01:50:36,152
Got it.

916
01:50:36,232 --> 01:50:37,533
Okay, thanks for clarifying.

917
01:50:37,693 --> 01:50:40,354
So here's what my recommendation will be.

918
01:50:41,955 --> 01:50:48,758
City staff, I believe, has already been discussing some of these ideas with you.

919
01:50:48,778 --> 01:50:52,400
I would like to keep things tangible for this hearing.

920
01:50:52,500 --> 01:50:56,061
So, you know, Medford is not a city that is,

921
01:50:58,251 --> 01:51:05,875
flush in its cash coffers for making infrastructure improvements to roads.

922
01:51:06,196 --> 01:51:20,084
And so rather than leave it fuzzy, maybe there could be some discussions now about things like feasibility and appetite for various sorts of improvements.

923
01:51:20,184 --> 01:51:25,687
And then for the purposes of the board's consideration, we can just get clarity from you on

924
01:51:27,528 --> 01:51:36,751
any improvements to intersections that are most strongly being considered as possibilities to include within the scope of the project.

925
01:51:36,791 --> 01:51:40,453
I just want to avoid a situation where it's like, yeah, great.

926
01:51:41,693 --> 01:51:46,235
We both think this should happen, and then it's just completely up in the air.

927
01:51:48,804 --> 01:51:50,327
how that becomes a reality.

928
01:51:50,347 --> 01:51:57,282
I think it'll be hard for the board to assess if that's what we're presented with.

929
01:52:00,797 --> 01:52:03,838
Does that seem like something we could do?

930
01:52:04,118 --> 01:52:14,640
I understand the language surrounding conditions and so on, especially as it pertains to things that are not on the site itself is somewhat complicated.

931
01:52:15,480 --> 01:52:28,303
But could we at least try to make it a little bit more tangible than just a commitment to talk about it and like a presumption of some cost sharing arrangement to be worked out later?

932
01:52:30,057 --> 01:52:31,959
I think we can make it more tangible.

933
01:52:33,661 --> 01:52:35,844
I don't know if we can tonight, and I would defer to Scott.

934
01:52:36,064 --> 01:52:40,990
Yeah, I don't expect tonight, but by the end of the hearing, ideally, yeah, would be great.

935
01:52:43,014 --> 01:52:45,015
Yes, yeah, I can chime in.

936
01:52:45,315 --> 01:52:46,035
Yeah, we can.

937
01:52:46,555 --> 01:52:53,397
I think at the outset of this hearing, as we just to reset the table, I think the purpose of this hearing was.

938
01:52:54,177 --> 01:53:05,141
This evening that is was for us to provide responses to beta's response to the TIA included considerations for mitigation.

939
01:53:05,501 --> 01:53:09,602
There is a summary by by Scott as to how some of those have been.

940
01:53:10,582 --> 01:53:12,584
received and how some of those have been studied.

941
01:53:12,604 --> 01:53:33,200
So I think from here to your point, Mr. Chair, some of the next steps would be to get in and have some specific conversations about what we think is feasible, what we think isn't, and that would also likely include a closeout from Jeff from the beta team.

942
01:53:33,220 --> 01:53:35,062
I think we submitted our comments

943
01:53:36,863 --> 01:53:40,164
our response to Beta's comments on May 2nd.

944
01:53:40,204 --> 01:54:03,269
So, you know, if we are able to get the Beta team's sort of final response and close out to our comments, then I think we can certainly start to have the productive conversations that you're discussing, that you're mentioning, and move towards a common goal of making improvements for the neighborhood and for the project that makes sense.

945
01:54:05,202 --> 01:54:06,543
Okay, great, thank you.

946
01:54:06,863 --> 01:54:11,506
Attorney Gallagher, I think there was something else you wanted to say as well, so sorry I interjected.

947
01:54:12,626 --> 01:54:18,910
No, Mr. Chair, I think that covered it and I think I agree with you.

948
01:54:18,930 --> 01:54:30,597
I think it's getting into some of those details will be important so that we're not leaving this to kind of an up in the air unknown.

949
01:54:32,668 --> 01:54:47,539
But again, I think just to emphasize that there are certain things we're not going to be able to do, not because we don't want to, but because it's just not feasible relative to the project and the scope.

950
01:54:48,439 --> 01:54:48,860
Understood.

951
01:54:49,120 --> 01:54:51,521
Thank you.

952
01:54:51,702 --> 01:54:52,522
Jim, please go ahead.

953
01:54:53,143 --> 01:54:55,344
Just some clarification.

954
01:54:56,025 --> 01:55:00,508
Are we assuming that all the traffic is coming from Boston?

955
01:55:01,963 --> 01:55:13,866
And the reason why I ask the question is because I know if I'm on Salem Street, I can go down Riverside Ave onto Central Ave and take a right onto the Fellsway.

956
01:55:14,806 --> 01:55:31,170
And there are other areas too, if I'm traveling Fellsway further down, or if I'm coming out of Boston, I can stay on Middlesex Ave and get on the Fellsway that way as well.

957
01:55:31,703 --> 01:55:38,090
and go down to Riverside Ave, Spring Street, to Central Ave, and around.

958
01:55:38,911 --> 01:55:53,006
I mean, are we assuming that most of the traffic will be coming from Boston down the Fellsway over to that intersection where Central Ave is in the Fellsway?

959
01:55:54,804 --> 01:56:06,368
Yeah, so the majority of the traffic is destined to the south, and that's just based on the census data.

960
01:56:06,548 --> 01:56:22,995
But we have assumed that some of the traffic would be coming from Salem Street, and some would go out to Riverside, and then some would stay on the Fellsway or come in on the Fellsway to get to the site.

961
01:56:25,017 --> 01:56:27,238
Right, okay.

962
01:56:28,098 --> 01:56:30,519
I mean, there's just so many ways to get there.

963
01:56:30,539 --> 01:56:34,880
I've been, you know, from 93.

964
01:56:35,681 --> 01:56:49,005
If somebody's trying to avoid that intersection, because I travel that a lot, and you see that that intersection is congested during rush hour.

965
01:56:50,166 --> 01:56:54,287
So you did mention that they would try to extend

966
01:56:55,203 --> 01:57:03,876
That area, because they only let so many cars in, only so many cars can fit, because you can't get over.

967
01:57:03,896 --> 01:57:07,601
There's just not enough room to get over.

968
01:57:08,102 --> 01:57:11,086
So would they be trying to extend that further back?

969
01:57:11,805 --> 01:57:18,855
Yeah, I think that's what that that's what Jeff and beta were were asking us to investigate.

970
01:57:19,236 --> 01:57:26,787
And, you know, if that if that left turn lane pocket would be, you know, if it if it carry if it.

971
01:57:27,508 --> 01:57:32,970
If you can fit four cars in there now, maybe it could be extended.

972
01:57:33,010 --> 01:57:38,773
You could take out some of the median and maybe it could be extended to fit another four cars.

973
01:57:40,593 --> 01:57:52,819
We took a quick look at it and as Jeff indicated, it seemed like the main issue would be removal of some mature trees that are there.

974
01:57:53,539 --> 01:57:55,660
The width is not,

975
01:57:58,642 --> 01:58:10,191
But, you know, again, it's, you know, I mean, it's, it's something that, you know, it would, it would need to be worked out with DCR and they, you know, they have, you know, they have, you know, they have, you know,

976
01:58:11,295 --> 01:58:25,338
it's amazing, well, trees are, especially lively trees along roadways that are in good condition are viewed with a pretty, in pretty high regard these days.

977
01:58:26,599 --> 01:58:28,319
So that may be a consideration as well.

978
01:58:29,999 --> 01:58:30,360
Thank you.

979
01:58:30,380 --> 01:58:36,201
All right, other questions or comments from the board?

980
01:58:41,844 --> 01:58:56,375
Seeing none, chair awaits a motion to open public comment on the traffic peer review and responses.

981
01:58:57,476 --> 01:58:57,796
I move.

982
01:58:58,577 --> 01:58:58,997
Second.

983
01:58:59,818 --> 01:59:00,198
OK.

984
01:59:00,558 --> 01:59:01,559
We'll take a roll call.

985
01:59:01,639 --> 01:59:02,099
Jamie?

986
01:59:02,119 --> 01:59:02,880
Aye.

987
01:59:03,560 --> 01:59:04,041
Andre?

988
01:59:04,581 --> 01:59:04,781
Aye.

989
01:59:05,382 --> 01:59:05,782
Jim?

990
01:59:06,603 --> 01:59:06,723
Aye.

991
01:59:07,303 --> 01:59:07,644
Chris?

992
01:59:08,864 --> 01:59:09,105
Aye.

993
01:59:09,745 --> 01:59:09,945
Mike?

994
01:59:10,526 --> 01:59:10,666
Aye.

995
01:59:11,851 --> 01:59:15,133
All right, members of the public, we are now open for public comment.

996
01:59:15,334 --> 01:59:24,320
If you'd like to speak on the traffic peer review or the responses to it, you may do so now.

997
01:59:24,340 --> 01:59:33,427
You can raise your hand on Zoom, raise your hand on the camera, type in chat, or email Dennis at dmcdougall at medford-ma.gov.

998
01:59:53,566 --> 01:59:55,627
Motion to close the public comment.

999
01:59:56,528 --> 01:59:57,108
Do I have a second?

1000
01:59:57,648 --> 01:59:57,969
Second.

1001
01:59:59,029 --> 02:00:01,090
All right, we're going to take another roll call.

1002
02:00:01,471 --> 02:00:01,951
Jamie?

1003
02:00:01,971 --> 02:00:02,851
Aye.

1004
02:00:03,592 --> 02:00:04,032
Andre?

1005
02:00:04,052 --> 02:00:04,112
Aye.

1006
02:00:05,473 --> 02:00:05,793
Jim?

1007
02:00:06,454 --> 02:00:06,594
Aye.

1008
02:00:07,394 --> 02:00:07,754
Chris?

1009
02:00:08,715 --> 02:00:08,895
Aye.

1010
02:00:09,815 --> 02:00:10,096
Mike?

1011
02:00:10,516 --> 02:00:10,616
Aye.

1012
02:00:10,636 --> 02:00:13,938
All right, public comment is now closed on this portion.

1013
02:00:16,043 --> 02:00:24,527
All right, I believe that takes us to the end of our planned agenda, or at least for this hearing tonight.

1014
02:00:26,288 --> 02:00:40,916
And so in terms of the hearing schedule, the next topic is review of the waiver list, as well as proposed conditions.

1015
02:00:41,616 --> 02:00:42,437
So we have a

1016
02:00:44,886 --> 02:00:48,749
meeting scheduled for Thursday, May 16th.

1017
02:00:50,551 --> 02:00:52,613
And that's the intention on that date.

1018
02:00:54,174 --> 02:00:57,377
I know that the board did receive an updated waiver list.

1019
02:00:57,757 --> 02:01:02,181
There have been updates to the site plan since then.

1020
02:01:02,201 --> 02:01:12,410
I haven't checked whether this has resulted in additional modifications to that list, but I just want to check in before we close.

1021
02:01:14,676 --> 02:01:16,317
So, Mr chair, I can respond to that.

1022
02:01:16,737 --> 02:01:18,798
Um, I, I think that.

1023
02:01:20,359 --> 02:01:22,360
It's possible there may be a few.

1024
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:27,022
Changes or additional waivers we were hoping and, and I, I guess.

1025
02:01:27,622 --> 02:01:32,925
Waiting to get through, um, the comments on the civil portion in particular.

1026
02:01:33,905 --> 02:01:36,006
Um, so I, I, I think would defer.

1027
02:01:36,726 --> 02:01:41,248
To, uh, Steve Matarano at bowler and, and to the beta team.

1028
02:01:44,191 --> 02:01:52,813
And to the extent that there were any additional comments or changes to the plans, that could obviously have an effect on any waiver requests that we would need to add.

1029
02:01:52,833 --> 02:01:57,753
I believe that otherwise the list should be close to final.

1030
02:01:57,873 --> 02:02:12,016
So we can certainly work to make any final updates to that between now and the next hearing and give the board and attorney have any time to review those updates.

1031
02:02:13,550 --> 02:02:23,376
And it would be just pending any final comments on our written responses for the civil plan set.

1032
02:02:24,937 --> 02:02:27,519
All right, thank you.

1033
02:02:27,619 --> 02:02:38,946
And then one other thing I do just want to spread awareness about, so this is on the published schedule, but essentially we have

1034
02:02:40,575 --> 02:02:43,978
Two meetings left, so we have the Thursday.

1035
02:02:45,639 --> 02:02:47,021
May 16th meeting.

1036
02:02:47,041 --> 02:02:49,723
Where the focus is going to be on.

1037
02:02:52,674 --> 02:02:54,275
the waiver list and the proposed conditions.

1038
02:02:54,295 --> 02:03:06,182
I understand we have some not quite final elements elsewhere in the project, so we'll carve out some time for kind of housekeeping items and updates.

1039
02:03:07,563 --> 02:03:14,588
And then the following Tuesday, May 21st, that is our last scheduled meeting.

1040
02:03:15,988 --> 02:03:16,988
session of this hearing.

1041
02:03:17,128 --> 02:03:43,053
And so that is the date that the board intends to hear any additional feedback from the proponent on the proposed conditions, if it required additional research, and then to vote on the outcome of this hearing itself and any proposed conditions.

1042
02:03:43,153 --> 02:03:45,053
So I just want to

1043
02:03:46,590 --> 02:03:59,365
say that out loud so that there's an opportunity now, if anyone wants to alert me of something that we also are going to need to do in those two meetings or any updates, now would be a good time to let me know.

1044
02:03:59,525 --> 02:04:03,730
Otherwise, that is the plan for how we're going to close this one out.

1045
02:04:09,795 --> 02:04:12,517
Mister chair that that schedule makes sense to me.

1046
02:04:13,739 --> 02:04:20,126
I think you know just to echo what I was saying earlier in the evening when I think the photometric plan came up.

1047
02:04:21,527 --> 02:04:27,073
I think to the extent that there are questions that can be addressed in the form of a comment.

1048
02:04:27,874 --> 02:04:28,635
Rather a condition.

1049
02:04:31,139 --> 02:04:34,141
Um, that would require additional information to be.

1050
02:04:34,801 --> 02:04:42,004
Provided satisfactory to the board, for example, um, I, I think that if there are ways that we can craft conditions in a way.

1051
02:04:42,024 --> 02:04:44,885
That would get us to closure on the 21st.

1052
02:04:45,866 --> 02:04:48,507
Um, just so that we're not losing time.

1053
02:04:49,147 --> 02:04:54,770
You know, chasing down answers, um, that are not necessarily immediately available.

1054
02:04:55,690 --> 02:04:57,951
Um, I, I would also just add that.

1055
02:04:58,651 --> 02:04:59,272
You know, the.

1056
02:05:00,255 --> 02:05:02,857
This project will be going through review as well.

1057
02:05:02,937 --> 02:05:06,799
So, particularly on questions that relate to jurisdiction.

1058
02:05:08,500 --> 02:05:11,221
And looking at the DCR controlled intersections.

1059
02:05:11,922 --> 02:05:15,384
I think that's all review that's going to be ongoing.

1060
02:05:16,524 --> 02:05:18,846
And that will continue to take a deeper look at.

1061
02:05:19,826 --> 02:05:23,388
So, to the extent that that provides some comfort to the board as well, that.

1062
02:05:24,649 --> 02:05:29,912
You know, there, there will be, for example, additional alternatives analysis.

1063
02:05:30,583 --> 02:05:34,684
specific to those DCR intersections as part of MAPR review, I expect.

1064
02:05:37,444 --> 02:05:56,408
There's more time to be thinking about the best solution out there, not necessarily in the context of what would be in a final comprehensive permit, but certainly what would be required in connection with the construction of the project.

1065
02:05:56,428 --> 02:05:58,368
Understood.

1066
02:05:58,468 --> 02:05:58,808
Thank you.

1067
02:06:00,083 --> 02:06:03,004
Other comments?

1068
02:06:03,364 --> 02:06:03,664
Yes.

1069
02:06:04,324 --> 02:06:06,864
Cliff Boehner, please go ahead.

1070
02:06:07,024 --> 02:06:07,425
Thanks.

1071
02:06:08,305 --> 02:06:28,949
I just wanted to say that if there is going to be a kind of record stat that is submitted that captures a lot of the comments we've heard and changes that could be made, I'm just wondering when that might be

1072
02:06:29,908 --> 02:06:30,548
available.

1073
02:06:31,548 --> 02:06:42,351
I think we all know, as was stated earlier tonight, that there may be things that are reasonably now developed at this point, but could end up as conditions.

1074
02:06:43,391 --> 02:06:50,753
And I would like to know if there's going to be a point when there's a set that is submitted

1075
02:06:51,940 --> 02:07:02,147
so that I can review it and draft any conditions that are related to architecture or some of the interrelated issues that include civil.

1076
02:07:04,949 --> 02:07:05,389
Thank you.

1077
02:07:05,409 --> 02:07:08,231
Mr. Chair, can I address that?

1078
02:07:08,611 --> 02:07:09,292
Yeah, please go ahead.

1079
02:07:10,470 --> 02:07:11,050
Thank you.

1080
02:07:11,150 --> 02:07:20,995
Cliff, I will be working on drafting a draft decision that I hope to have to the board prior to the meeting on the 16th.

1081
02:07:21,756 --> 02:07:33,441
It would be very helpful if all of the peer review consultants can get to me a list of conditions that they believe should be imposed as part of the decision within their areas.

1082
02:07:33,501 --> 02:07:34,482
So give me a list of

1083
02:07:35,082 --> 02:07:41,645
your architectural conditions, peer-to-civil peer review consultants, give me a list of your suggested conditions.

1084
02:07:41,926 --> 02:07:45,287
This makes drafting that decision much, much easier for me.

1085
02:07:46,668 --> 02:07:48,409
That makes total sense.

1086
02:07:48,709 --> 02:08:04,237
I think maybe more specifically, I'm thinking about the last hearing when we were looking at some images that had been discussed in a working session prior to the last hearing, and we were still kind of toggling between

1087
02:08:05,558 --> 02:08:10,122
some options on building elevations, for example.

1088
02:08:11,182 --> 02:08:28,955
It isn't totally clear to me where we landed or where the developer landed on what they'd like to do, and some of my conditions kind of depend upon what their most current commitment is, as demonstrated through the drawings.

1089
02:08:31,337 --> 02:08:32,198
Does that make sense?

1090
02:08:34,639 --> 02:08:43,625
I can try to interject or respond, I guess, not to be confrontational in any way, but I am a bit surprised to hear that, Cliff.

1091
02:08:44,506 --> 02:08:53,412
My recollection at the outset of the hearing on the 11th of April, we presented an elevation.

1092
02:08:57,328 --> 02:09:03,411
That was from us what we recommended and believed to be the best design for the project.

1093
02:09:04,612 --> 02:09:12,135
We did get some comments that that session that we took back and are able to take into account, but they were not

1094
02:09:13,920 --> 02:09:27,004
I would not call them, this isn't a scientific term, but significant to the point that the design needed to be significantly modified in any way to achieve a status that would allow you to provide comments.

1095
02:09:29,705 --> 02:09:42,751
It was my recollection at the outset, Cliff, that there was a commitment to provide comments based on the end of that session.

1096
02:09:44,172 --> 02:09:55,257
We, as a team, will be providing a comprehensive design package for final submission and for record at the outset of the comprehensive permit process, but that

1097
02:09:55,577 --> 02:10:01,119
is inclusive of the civil design as well that we are now wrapping up the peer review process for.

1098
02:10:01,219 --> 02:10:11,241
So we were not aware that the expectation on your part was that you needed another submission from us to provide comments.

1099
02:10:11,501 --> 02:10:14,462
That wasn't conveyed to us or discussed.

1100
02:10:14,602 --> 02:10:24,525
And frankly, in my opinion, it wasn't really required based on the way that things were left at the last hearing on the 11th.

1101
02:10:26,078 --> 02:10:35,460
So just to insert myself here for a moment, I may have misunderstood Cliff's comment, but that wasn't my reading of it.

1102
02:10:36,181 --> 02:10:54,005
So I think what I would like to ensure is the case is that any peer reviewer being asked to provide feedback on conditions has zero ambiguity as to the plans that they're

1103
02:10:56,143 --> 02:10:56,963
doing that for.

1104
02:10:57,244 --> 02:11:09,950
And so I was hearing that Cliff was just uncertain about whether what was presented in that meeting was what you intend to submit or whether there's a modification to that.

1105
02:11:10,090 --> 02:11:24,898
So yeah, maybe in addition to the final packet for record keeping purposes, if there's some way to very quickly just bottom out,

1106
02:11:26,608 --> 02:11:33,794
this is the set of exhibits that should be used for the proposal of conditions.

1107
02:11:34,075 --> 02:11:38,438
I think that would help everyone involved in the drafting of the decision.

1108
02:11:39,199 --> 02:11:40,860
Cliff, let me know if I misunderstood.

1109
02:11:40,921 --> 02:11:43,363
No, that's exactly right.

1110
02:11:45,585 --> 02:11:49,328
I'm sorry if that came across as confrontational.

1111
02:11:49,388 --> 02:11:50,048
It's not.

1112
02:11:50,128 --> 02:11:51,870
I think it's been a very cooperative

1113
02:11:53,094 --> 02:11:55,936
advancement that we've all worked together for.

1114
02:11:55,996 --> 02:12:09,963
So I just want to make sure that we're at a point where we all agree, all of us are commenting on what you consider to be the last submission of documents prior to the decision.

1115
02:12:09,983 --> 02:12:11,884
Got it.

1116
02:12:12,024 --> 02:12:12,384
Understood.

1117
02:12:12,404 --> 02:12:15,006
Yeah, we can certainly confirm that for you.

1118
02:12:15,026 --> 02:12:17,367
Sorry if I misinterpreted what you were saying.

1119
02:12:19,567 --> 02:12:28,050
we will ensure that you understand exactly what our final submission package was that you would be preparing your comments for.

1120
02:12:28,070 --> 02:12:30,011
Terrific, thank you.

1121
02:12:30,531 --> 02:12:42,495
And I would go as far to say, Pat, I think, so CUBE 3 is not on tonight, but I think we can have them confirm early in the day tomorrow or as early as possible.

1122
02:12:43,377 --> 02:13:02,004
will confirm that the last set of documents that they had provided to you, Cliff, and I'm not sure exactly what the date was that they provided, but we'll confirm that whatever the last set of documents was is indeed the final set that you should be relying on for the purpose of generating any comments.

1123
02:13:03,004 --> 02:13:03,544
Terrific.

1124
02:13:03,844 --> 02:13:04,345
Thank you.

1125
02:13:05,885 --> 02:13:06,265
Wonderful.

1126
02:13:06,345 --> 02:13:06,806
Thank you all.

1127
02:13:07,886 --> 02:13:08,106
All right.

1128
02:13:08,226 --> 02:13:10,527
Other housekeeping items?

1129
02:13:18,769 --> 02:13:19,409
All right.

1130
02:13:19,550 --> 02:13:31,357
Seeing none, Chair awaits a motion to continue this matter to Thursday, May 16th at 6.30 PM.

1131
02:13:32,277 --> 02:13:32,577
So moved.

1132
02:13:32,617 --> 02:13:34,078
Do I have a second?

1133
02:13:34,819 --> 02:13:34,979
Second.

1134
02:13:34,999 --> 02:13:37,560
All right, we're going to take a roll call.

1135
02:13:37,620 --> 02:13:38,121
Jamie?

1136
02:13:38,141 --> 02:13:38,821
Aye.

1137
02:13:39,662 --> 02:13:40,102
Andre?

1138
02:13:40,122 --> 02:13:40,802
Aye.

1139
02:13:41,603 --> 02:13:42,003
Jim?

1140
02:13:42,844 --> 02:13:42,984
Aye.

1141
02:13:43,564 --> 02:13:43,964
Chris?

1142
02:13:45,025 --> 02:13:45,145
Aye.

1143
02:13:45,906 --> 02:13:46,666
Mike, aye.

1144
02:13:47,238 --> 02:13:50,320
All right, this matter is continued to next week.

1145
02:13:50,740 --> 02:13:51,621
We will see you all then.

1146
02:13:51,841 --> 02:13:52,421
Thanks, folks.

1147
02:13:53,181 --> 02:13:53,542
Good night.

1148
02:13:54,422 --> 02:13:54,962
Thank you very much.

1149
02:13:55,002 --> 02:13:55,303
Thank you.

1150
02:13:55,383 --> 02:14:01,766
All right, and Dennis, we have a couple of administrative items on the agenda.

1151
02:14:01,846 --> 02:14:04,488
So why don't we just go through those as well?

1152
02:14:05,348 --> 02:14:06,629
Oh, we might have lost.

1153
02:14:06,809 --> 02:14:07,149
No, no.

1154
02:14:07,890 --> 02:14:09,151
Some people dropped off camera.

1155
02:14:09,211 --> 02:14:10,331
I hope we didn't lose members.

1156
02:14:13,413 --> 02:14:14,454
I think we just lost quorum.

1157
02:14:16,038 --> 02:14:17,319
Okay, Andre is coming back.

1158
02:14:27,428 --> 02:14:27,908
You're back.

1159
02:14:27,968 --> 02:14:28,669
Thanks, Andre.

1160
02:14:28,689 --> 02:14:31,091
You saved us from an awkward administrative.

1161
02:14:32,292 --> 02:14:33,273
Sorry, I jumped the gun.

1162
02:14:33,313 --> 02:14:34,454
Yeah, you're good.

1163
02:14:34,514 --> 02:14:34,835
You're good.

1164
02:14:35,575 --> 02:14:37,697
All right, Dennis, what's the next item, please?

1165
02:14:39,959 --> 02:14:40,480
You're on mute.

1166
02:14:45,170 --> 02:14:45,870
You're still on mute.

1167
02:14:47,511 --> 02:14:47,751
Sorry.

1168
02:14:48,672 --> 02:14:51,273
Um, nothing really administratively.

1169
02:14:51,613 --> 02:15:10,123
Um, there have been, we've got a few, um, meeting minutes that we can, if we want to go that are in the, uh, in the Google drive, we have meeting minutes from March 26th and April 11th and April 23rd just got on.

1170
02:15:10,223 --> 02:15:13,905
So I don't know if people had a chance to review that one yet, but the 26th and the 11th there.

1171
02:15:15,542 --> 02:15:16,342
have been appropriate.

1172
02:15:17,163 --> 02:15:28,427
Since we're missing Jim, Mary, and Yvette, and we're meeting again in a week, my suggestion would be we just wait until next week.

1173
02:15:28,507 --> 02:15:29,948
Is that OK with everyone?

1174
02:15:29,968 --> 02:15:31,088
Yeah.

1175
02:15:33,249 --> 02:15:33,489
OK.

1176
02:15:34,950 --> 02:15:35,250
Cool.

1177
02:15:35,670 --> 02:15:37,071
All right.

1178
02:15:37,271 --> 02:15:40,792
And then is there an administrative update?

1179
02:15:43,850 --> 02:15:45,191
Regarding this, no, I don't think so.

1180
02:15:45,211 --> 02:15:53,640
I think, you know, there was the puckle buck that I gave you guys about a potential meeting that no longer exists.

1181
02:15:53,820 --> 02:15:58,404
So I think, you know, we can move past that, and I will discuss that in another forum.

1182
02:15:58,564 --> 02:16:02,688
But I think I don't want Felicia at something.

1183
02:16:02,748 --> 02:16:03,629
I just saw her pop in.

1184
02:16:03,649 --> 02:16:05,131
So, but no, she's struggling.

1185
02:16:05,171 --> 02:16:06,552
So I think we're good.

1186
02:16:07,213 --> 02:16:08,354
I've been here the whole time.

1187
02:16:10,615 --> 02:16:13,536
Yeah, we almost had a weird one for you guys, but they withdrew.

1188
02:16:13,556 --> 02:16:17,317
We consulted legal.

1189
02:16:18,017 --> 02:16:20,758
Maybe, Mike, were you on with us with legal?

1190
02:16:21,358 --> 02:16:22,519
No, I wasn't.

1191
02:16:22,859 --> 02:16:26,420
So Dennis sent the scheduling email, but that's it.

1192
02:16:28,769 --> 02:16:29,510
Yeah, so anyway.

1193
02:16:29,530 --> 02:16:37,502
I didn't want to go into too much detail about the specifics because there were lawyers involved and I wasn't sure exactly how much detail I wanted to get into.

1194
02:16:39,164 --> 02:16:40,366
I'm always wary of lawyers.

1195
02:16:41,508 --> 02:16:42,329
Happy to tell you later.

1196
02:16:43,851 --> 02:16:56,715
