[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you all so much for coming.

20
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:06,498
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the follow-up on the resolution.

21
00:01:06,518 --> 00:01:25,970
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't actually have the resolution number in front of me, but be it resolved that the Subcommittee for Curriculum Instruction Assessment and Accountability meet with the Assistant Superintendent of Academics and Instruction and other relevant staff to discuss the development of a process to review and assess recently adopted curricula and assessment tools across the district

22
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:37,471
[SPEAKER_03]: and to identify the key stakeholders, timelines, and protocols to be involved in these reviews consistent with the policies described in Section I of the Medford School Committee Online Policy Manual.

23
00:01:39,515 --> 00:01:53,140
[SPEAKER_03]: So by way of context, we've called this meeting because in recent years, the Medford Public Schools have adopted a number of new curricular materials through a robust process of review and input and stakeholder input.

24
00:01:53,801 --> 00:02:04,025
[SPEAKER_03]: And we would like to have the ability to assess whether our goals for adopting those materials are being achieved and what that looks like in terms of

25
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:18,837
[SPEAKER_03]: The materials themselves as well as the instruction and the student and by way of further context in the Medford public schools strategic plan item a one is to establish an ongoing process of curriculum review.

26
00:02:19,738 --> 00:02:28,325
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm happy to pull up that document with the details of that, but I've asked Dr Lucy to give us an update on where we are because phase one.

27
00:02:29,446 --> 00:02:37,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Is slated for 2021 through 2024 and here we are in 2024 and we'd like to get ahead of the process so.

28
00:02:38,632 --> 00:02:47,517
[SPEAKER_03]: I think if we start with an update on phase 1 and then discuss what phase 2 looks like, is it useful to say who's in the room here from the schools?

29
00:02:48,397 --> 00:02:49,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we do that.

30
00:02:50,021 --> 00:02:50,601
[SPEAKER_08]: I would agree.

31
00:02:50,861 --> 00:02:57,804
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you, um, would it be okay if everybody just kind of went around and introduced themselves and what their role is within the district?

32
00:02:58,764 --> 00:02:59,524
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, that would be great.

33
00:02:59,544 --> 00:03:05,546
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I mean, you already introduced me, but, um, Suzanne Galussi, assistant superintendent for curriculum and instruction.

34
00:03:05,786 --> 00:03:06,606
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much.

35
00:03:08,707 --> 00:03:10,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Marice Edouard-Vincent, superintendent of schools.

36
00:03:15,309 --> 00:03:17,310
[SPEAKER_09]: Joan Bowen, director of student services.

37
00:03:22,417 --> 00:03:24,218
[SPEAKER_05]: Nicole Key is the Director of Humanities.

38
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:28,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Isaac Han, Director of Mathematics.

39
00:03:32,121 --> 00:03:35,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Bernadette Riccadeli, Director of Professional Learning and Student Assessment.

40
00:03:38,784 --> 00:03:41,406
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Shannon Demos, Principal of the Brooks Elementary School.

41
00:03:46,068 --> 00:03:48,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi there, Jennifer Skane, Principal of Andrews Middle School.

42
00:03:52,507 --> 00:03:54,648
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, everyone, I'm Nick Tucci, principal of the McGlynn Middle School.

43
00:03:57,729 --> 00:04:02,051
[SPEAKER_08]: And we definitely also have Michelle Kroll on the call.

44
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:07,213
[SPEAKER_08]: She's the principal of the Roberts, but I know she's just finishing up something in the building.

45
00:04:08,194 --> 00:04:12,396
[SPEAKER_08]: But I want to make sure that she was recognized.

46
00:04:12,976 --> 00:04:19,279
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know somewhere Dr. Cushing was on this call as well, but I think he's just in listening mode right now.

47
00:04:22,642 --> 00:04:29,991
[SPEAKER_08]: So I mean, I think the best, just maybe the best way to handle some of this, we have some wonderful expertise on the call.

48
00:04:30,552 --> 00:04:39,062
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, oh, and I see Paul Texera is coming in to the call right now, the director of English Learner Department.

49
00:04:41,997 --> 00:04:52,109
[SPEAKER_08]: But with all the expertise on the, Paul, Paul, I'm so sorry to put you on the spot the minute you come in the room, but you mind introducing yourselves before we get going?

50
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,271
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, I'm Baltic Sarah.

51
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:58,616
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm the director of the English Learner Education Program for the Medford Public Schools.

52
00:04:59,697 --> 00:05:00,058
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

53
00:05:03,602 --> 00:05:09,766
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Reinfeld, I would agree to start with, I had made a copy if you would like I can share my screen.

54
00:05:09,786 --> 00:05:26,314
[SPEAKER_08]: I had made a copy of the A1 curriculum document that's linked to the strategic plan and I just added a column so that we have like a starting point to provide an update for the work that's been done throughout the life of the strategic plan.

55
00:05:26,334 --> 00:05:28,475
[SPEAKER_08]: Does that sound okay?

56
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,414
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, can everyone see my screen?

57
00:05:46,464 --> 00:05:50,948
[SPEAKER_08]: So I've lost sight of all of you, so I just need a verbal.

58
00:05:51,088 --> 00:05:52,049
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we can see you.

59
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:53,290
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

60
00:05:54,071 --> 00:05:54,492
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

61
00:05:55,032 --> 00:05:59,777
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so this is the A1 curriculum tab from the strategic plan.

62
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:07,764
[SPEAKER_08]: And this outlined the work that the district did between the years of 2021 and 2024, so currently.

63
00:06:11,107 --> 00:06:15,608
[SPEAKER_08]: So for each action item, we just provided an update.

64
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:22,530
[SPEAKER_08]: So the first one said, deliver professional development activities related to the revisions of the Massachusetts curriculum frameworks.

65
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:35,433
[SPEAKER_08]: So internally, we have a spreadsheet that Dr. Riccadeli started and that we've been updating, which speaks to the current curriculum per each department.

66
00:06:37,717 --> 00:06:46,242
[SPEAKER_08]: And it kind of lets us know where we are within the curriculum cycle per department, per grade level.

67
00:06:47,163 --> 00:06:51,646
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not quite sure if you'd like me to just also open that up.

68
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:56,348
[SPEAKER_08]: And just briefly, I don't know if we need to necessarily hit every tab.

69
00:06:56,729 --> 00:06:59,510
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think we should dive deep, but just to get a sense of what that looks like.

70
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:00,111
[SPEAKER_08]: Just to get a sense.

71
00:07:00,131 --> 00:07:02,052
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is the English Language Arts one.

72
00:07:02,072 --> 00:07:03,253
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can see it goes from K to 12.

73
00:07:08,307 --> 00:07:21,696
[SPEAKER_08]: lists the program that's being used, when the implementation year was, the criteria and the components of the program, and a little baseline as to when it would be up for the next review cycle.

74
00:07:22,957 --> 00:07:33,164
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have that for all of our departments, just to get an understanding of how we're tracking things internally.

75
00:07:38,018 --> 00:07:43,182
[SPEAKER_08]: So the second action item was use a protocol for assessing instructional materials for bias.

76
00:07:43,843 --> 00:07:57,155
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is part of the core review process we go through when we're looking at reviewing curriculum updates, as well as brand new programs and part of that cycle per the Department of Education

77
00:07:57,955 --> 00:08:09,180
[SPEAKER_08]: includes a review of ed reports and the curate system so that part of that review is done when we are updating the curriculum within each department.

78
00:08:10,581 --> 00:08:19,185
[SPEAKER_08]: Please just like interrupt with any questions or if there's administrators on the call that want to add to anything I'm saying, just chime in please.

79
00:08:20,412 --> 00:08:32,795
[SPEAKER_08]: The next action item is to create a master list of adoption cycle curriculum offerings, which we have done as I showed in the updated curriculum catalog.

80
00:08:33,435 --> 00:08:46,219
[SPEAKER_08]: And then one of the things that we've been working on is a draft process to finalize that curriculum review process from Medford Public Schools.

81
00:08:47,222 --> 00:08:55,343
[SPEAKER_08]: which I think we can maybe highlight once I get through the action items, just so that we can provide first a base review of the work we've done.

82
00:08:55,363 --> 00:08:55,824
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

83
00:08:56,859 --> 00:08:58,820
[SPEAKER_08]: So the next one just says update curriculum.

84
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:03,523
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is something as in that spreadsheet that's ongoing.

85
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:11,208
[SPEAKER_08]: So sometimes it's that we've been with a curriculum for a long time and we're seeing that we need something new because it's not maybe hitting student needs.

86
00:09:11,828 --> 00:09:20,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes it's the Massachusetts Department of Education has updated the frameworks and the standards that teachers use when they're teaching.

87
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:24,716
[SPEAKER_08]: And so there are many reasons why we initiate curriculum reviews.

88
00:09:26,297 --> 00:09:40,324
[SPEAKER_08]: When the strategic plan was written in 2020 for a launch in 2021, this column here highlighted some of the work that had begun and or ongoing or maybe nearly completed.

89
00:09:41,744 --> 00:09:46,246
[SPEAKER_08]: And so over here, the updates per department are all listed here.

90
00:09:46,346 --> 00:09:48,407
[SPEAKER_08]: So for the humanities,

91
00:09:50,365 --> 00:09:58,525
[SPEAKER_08]: Text lists were provided texts like lists of the texts that grade 6 through 8 and 11 were using the elementary.

92
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:04,880
[SPEAKER_08]: started the core review process for a new curriculum last year.

93
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,521
[SPEAKER_08]: And last year was like the review process.

94
00:10:08,621 --> 00:10:13,802
[SPEAKER_08]: This year was the full implementation of the Houghton Mifflin Program.

95
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:30,346
[SPEAKER_08]: PD has been sustained and embedded all year long, both through Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, who's the publisher of the program, as well as through a partnership we have with HILFA Literacy, which is a literacy consulting firm of expert

96
00:10:32,508 --> 00:10:33,889
[SPEAKER_08]: reading specialists in the field.

97
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:39,094
[SPEAKER_08]: Physical education and health is quite long because they've been doing a lot of work.

98
00:10:39,234 --> 00:10:44,099
[SPEAKER_08]: So their health curriculum updated per the Department of Education in 2023.

99
00:10:46,204 --> 00:10:54,010
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I know that director Rachel Perry, along with assistant superintendent Dr. Cushing, they both sat on the HECAC committee.

100
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:59,154
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe member Reinfeld, member Rousseau also sat on that committee.

101
00:10:59,174 --> 00:11:06,099
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm apologizing if anyone else on this meeting also sat on that committee and I failed to acknowledge you, I apologize.

102
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,922
[SPEAKER_08]: But I know they've done a lot of work.

103
00:11:10,482 --> 00:11:12,584
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is the.

104
00:11:13,905 --> 00:11:16,887
[SPEAKER_08]: In a snapshot, I know the biggest implementations.

105
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:18,889
[SPEAKER_08]: That work is ongoing.

106
00:11:18,989 --> 00:11:20,951
[SPEAKER_08]: So, this year, the 5th grade.

107
00:11:22,847 --> 00:11:29,433
[SPEAKER_08]: Puberty has shifted the curriculum that we're using and the approach and the format that we're using.

108
00:11:30,093 --> 00:11:32,055
[SPEAKER_08]: Those lessons have started this year.

109
00:11:32,075 --> 00:11:47,069
[SPEAKER_08]: And so some of the work is still continuous as they're looking to update per the frameworks, but I know that they began with the health curriculum and then she's looking to move next to the physical education curriculum.

110
00:11:47,729 --> 00:11:57,472
[SPEAKER_08]: So implemented this year, as I have said, was the fifth grade puberty lessons, along with making sure that that work aligned.

111
00:11:57,932 --> 00:12:06,595
[SPEAKER_08]: We've updated Nexus at the elementary level so that Nexus is handling the health curriculum, which is Michigan model.

112
00:12:06,895 --> 00:12:07,835
[SPEAKER_08]: And Ms.

113
00:12:07,915 --> 00:12:12,817
[SPEAKER_08]: Perry has been working directly with the Nexus teachers in that department.

114
00:12:15,013 --> 00:12:22,157
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know that the work to finish the new sex ed curriculum will be finished next year.

115
00:12:22,837 --> 00:12:25,038
[SPEAKER_08]: She has listed here recommendations.

116
00:12:26,699 --> 00:12:36,383
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, the work with the PE department that will begin next year, as you see here, to develop a physical education committee.

117
00:12:39,303 --> 00:12:52,815
[SPEAKER_08]: World Language also had frameworks somewhat recently updated, and so Dr. Vilma Bobo has started working with her staff to review the updated standards.

118
00:12:54,356 --> 00:13:02,143
[SPEAKER_08]: She's provided numerous opportunities for professional development and professional affiliations within her department.

119
00:13:04,635 --> 00:13:12,626
[SPEAKER_08]: Lesson plans and curricula will be aligned next year based on the work that she's been doing within her department to update to the frameworks.

120
00:13:14,589 --> 00:13:35,437
[SPEAKER_08]: Math, as we all know, and Faiza can speak to this much more closely than I can, but she's been in a constant state of alignment and adjustment within the math department, both at the middle school and the high school level to align to the integrated math pathways.

121
00:13:36,417 --> 00:13:40,979
[SPEAKER_08]: And elementary last year went through their full implementation year.

122
00:13:41,599 --> 00:13:44,703
[SPEAKER_08]: of the investigations three curriculum.

123
00:13:44,963 --> 00:13:48,086
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is year two for that curriculum.

124
00:13:49,067 --> 00:13:53,672
[SPEAKER_08]: Science FOSS was implemented, I believe, in 2018.

125
00:13:54,192 --> 00:13:58,957
[SPEAKER_08]: So next year we'll be looking to kind of review FOSS.

126
00:14:00,224 --> 00:14:02,245
[SPEAKER_08]: and see where we go from there.

127
00:14:02,265 --> 00:14:12,687
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the rest is pretty much, some of it is reiterating the things that I have just said in terms of the departments.

128
00:14:14,048 --> 00:14:21,570
[SPEAKER_08]: Additional information for science would be that at middle school, the STEM scopes curriculum was implemented in school year 2021.

129
00:14:25,134 --> 00:14:30,877
[SPEAKER_08]: High school ranges, which is reflective in the spreadsheet, but it ranges depending on the course.

130
00:14:31,977 --> 00:14:40,801
[SPEAKER_08]: So some of the curriculum began in 2019 where others were just updated last school year or this school year.

131
00:14:41,761 --> 00:14:43,402
[SPEAKER_08]: We spoke about health and world language.

132
00:14:47,003 --> 00:14:49,584
[SPEAKER_08]: And the only other piece right now would be technology.

133
00:14:52,472 --> 00:15:03,335
[SPEAKER_08]: Molly Layden, Director Molly Layden has worked to update the technology curriculum that is offered through the schools.

134
00:15:04,055 --> 00:15:13,538
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the things that she will begin, the work that will begin next year is updating the library curriculum to align with the library media.

135
00:15:15,172 --> 00:15:32,001
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the last piece of an update, the last action item here, speaks of review of new research-based comprehensive elementary literacy programs, rubrics to select elementary literacy programs and then implement elementary literacy programs.

136
00:15:34,487 --> 00:15:40,592
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a mouthful, but basically this has kind of two levels to it.

137
00:15:40,853 --> 00:15:51,602
[SPEAKER_08]: One was the work we did to become compliant with the Massachusetts literacy screener regulations under the dyslexia regulation.

138
00:15:52,203 --> 00:15:56,266
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that was the, we've had like a tiered approach to that, and that was,

139
00:15:57,667 --> 00:16:09,839
[SPEAKER_08]: This bottom piece here, which is the pilot of the DIBLS program, which fully meets, it's like full compliance per the Department of Education for meeting the literacy screener regulation.

140
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,161
[SPEAKER_08]: That pilot was done last year.

141
00:16:13,342 --> 00:16:34,258
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was fully implemented this year, elementary K-5, so all K-5 students received the benchmark DIBELS, and grades six through eight intervention students received DIBELS, either in a benchmark or progress monitoring situation.

142
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:41,687
[SPEAKER_08]: When it comes to, oh, also we implemented ECRI, which is Enhanced Core Reading Instruction.

143
00:16:42,707 --> 00:16:51,014
[SPEAKER_08]: This was to also comply to make sure that our reading instruction is structured and explicit.

144
00:16:51,694 --> 00:16:58,179
[SPEAKER_08]: And so all of our K-2 staff use ECRI when they're teaching reading to their students.

145
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:11,169
[SPEAKER_08]: In terms of the core review process, the Department of Education, as I stated, is very particular about the process that's used when districts are selecting new curriculum.

146
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:24,339
[SPEAKER_08]: And so this core review process, as aligned by Ed Reports and the curate system, we used HILFA literacy to help us engage in that work for the ELA reading program.

147
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:33,668
[SPEAKER_08]: This folder that's linked here also kind of explains the core review process, which was quite extensive.

148
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:49,403
[SPEAKER_08]: It included teachers, administrators, and caregivers to narrow down ELA programs and to finally select the one into reading that was implemented this year.

149
00:17:53,165 --> 00:17:58,609
[SPEAKER_08]: Any questions before I maybe stop the screen share?

150
00:18:09,496 --> 00:18:10,216
[SPEAKER_08]: I do apologize.

151
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,078
[SPEAKER_08]: I've lost the ability to see people.

152
00:18:14,547 --> 00:18:16,248
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm not quite sure if there are hands in the air.

153
00:18:16,828 --> 00:18:17,048
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I okay?

154
00:18:17,068 --> 00:18:18,209
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see any.

155
00:18:18,229 --> 00:18:20,850
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a quick question.

156
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:23,352
[SPEAKER_10]: So just, it's Nicole Branley.

157
00:18:23,392 --> 00:18:24,912
[SPEAKER_10]: I know if you can see me, I'm sure you know this voice.

158
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:39,220
[SPEAKER_10]: My question, I guess, this just makes me think as I'm seeing some of these names and some of these positions, how do we go about these strategies if some of these positions are cut?

159
00:18:40,881 --> 00:18:43,002
[SPEAKER_10]: Who does this fall on?

160
00:18:44,692 --> 00:18:52,859
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think, I mean, with all due respect, I think that that's maybe a conversation for a different meeting.

161
00:18:54,521 --> 00:19:09,434
[SPEAKER_08]: I think today, right now, we're kind of charged with talking about how we're going to create a process to show that our curriculum is effectively working for students.

162
00:19:11,543 --> 00:19:28,434
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that having all of these lovely experts here, I would really love to be able to have that conversation and tap into the school and department leaders that are on the call today, but I welcome that conversation at another point.

163
00:19:30,275 --> 00:19:32,076
[SPEAKER_10]: I will not forget my question, Mrs. Galusi.

164
00:19:32,096 --> 00:19:32,557
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't worry.

165
00:19:32,637 --> 00:19:33,037
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

166
00:19:33,537 --> 00:19:35,619
[SPEAKER_10]: I welcome that.

167
00:19:35,739 --> 00:19:36,119
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

168
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:37,720
[SPEAKER_10]: I know you always do.

169
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,381
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate it.

170
00:19:38,421 --> 00:19:38,721
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

171
00:19:39,586 --> 00:19:45,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Ruseau, did you have any questions, particularly as someone who's seen a lot of these curricula come in?

172
00:19:47,505 --> 00:19:47,645
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

173
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:48,667
[SPEAKER_03]: No, okay.

174
00:19:50,676 --> 00:19:57,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so I think what we want to do is so this is this gives us a really good foundation for what's been done, what's in progress.

175
00:19:57,742 --> 00:20:09,692
[SPEAKER_03]: I think one of the goals in calling this subcommittee at this point in time is to say when are so some of these things are due to be evaluated regularly and that's that process is in place.

176
00:20:11,714 --> 00:20:14,877
[SPEAKER_03]: But one of the things I want to be really thoughtful about is.

177
00:20:17,018 --> 00:20:19,679
[SPEAKER_03]: that there are a few different stages of assessing these.

178
00:20:19,739 --> 00:20:39,623
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know this is ridiculous for me to say with this many educators on the call, but one of the things that I've been thinking about in regards to this is that didactic triangle where the content is one piece of a triangle and the students and the teachers are the other points and assessing the content.

179
00:20:40,463 --> 00:20:46,231
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't just about the content itself, but it's about the relationship that that content has to the teachers and the students.

180
00:20:47,172 --> 00:20:54,822
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the review process isn't necessarily a conversation about the teacher student relationship, but it is to the content and the.

181
00:20:55,663 --> 00:21:05,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Into the teachers and the students and so some of that looks like the for the content and the teachers that looks like the implementation and is this doing is this working?

182
00:21:06,694 --> 00:21:18,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Are these things being implemented with fidelity and in a way that the teachers feel are adequately trained to teach this and then that seems to me something that needs to come earlier than the process of.

183
00:21:19,907 --> 00:21:34,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Assessing whether the students have mastery of the content or whether they're in well, hopefully the engagement with the content is coming sooner and to be able to assess that through observations through test scores, whatever it is and what that process looks like.

184
00:21:34,438 --> 00:21:36,780
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not just we're looking at everything altogether.

185
00:21:37,801 --> 00:21:38,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Once we hit.

186
00:21:39,462 --> 00:21:42,104
[SPEAKER_03]: the six years or the curriculum expires in 2029.

187
00:21:42,144 --> 00:21:45,407
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're just deciding if we're going to renew it.

188
00:21:45,868 --> 00:21:53,975
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to make sure that we have a process in place to review that in a strategic, targeted way at selected points.

189
00:21:54,175 --> 00:22:04,544
[SPEAKER_03]: And you all on the call know far better than I do what is feasible, because as we all know, you know, the more time you spend talking to people about what they're doing, that's less time that they're actually doing it.

190
00:22:05,024 --> 00:22:17,154
[SPEAKER_03]: So figuring out what that balance is, is something that I'd like to kind of lay out in terms of the timeline, who the stakeholders are, and the role that different people are going to be playing in a review process.

191
00:22:19,135 --> 00:22:19,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for that.

192
00:22:21,377 --> 00:22:22,178
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate that.

193
00:22:22,778 --> 00:22:31,425
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that is one of the main reasons why the district moved to bring in NWEA map growth.

194
00:22:33,126 --> 00:22:33,586
[SPEAKER_08]: Because

195
00:22:35,075 --> 00:22:54,868
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we all know, so we have multiple measures of assessment, and some are ongoing, and some are kind of like a snapshot, and MCAS is an end-of-year benchmark through the Department of Education, but it's a one-time test.

196
00:23:00,033 --> 00:23:00,954
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not a system.

197
00:23:01,134 --> 00:23:11,099
[SPEAKER_08]: And so NWEA map growth checked some of those boxes for us in that it is aligned to Common Core standards.

198
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,162
[SPEAKER_08]: It did include science and a lot of these

199
00:23:18,203 --> 00:23:26,852
[SPEAKER_08]: district-wide assessment measures only started with, like I-Ready, for example, were just math and reading or ELA.

200
00:23:27,332 --> 00:23:41,627
[SPEAKER_08]: And so one of the things that intrigued us about MAP was that it also included the science components so that we had these set benchmarks to see how our students are faring on common core standards.

201
00:23:42,267 --> 00:23:46,208
[SPEAKER_08]: outside of the curricula itself.

202
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:51,489
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I think that is definitely a component that we rely on.

203
00:23:53,170 --> 00:24:04,692
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think engaging in the conversation around the validity and the timeline is important because some programs are probably in the just right spot.

204
00:24:06,133 --> 00:24:10,294
[SPEAKER_08]: While it's difficult to look at some of those scores and call it

205
00:24:11,435 --> 00:24:14,018
[SPEAKER_08]: a reliable measure in like the first year of implementation.

206
00:24:14,859 --> 00:24:17,302
[SPEAKER_08]: So I know that Ms.

207
00:24:17,342 --> 00:24:23,289
[SPEAKER_08]: Khan, I don't know if not to put her on the spot, but I know she has seen some tremendous progress.

208
00:24:24,585 --> 00:24:41,189
[SPEAKER_08]: per MAP score is at the end of the year here in math, which is we're in like year two of the curriculum implementation, but we're not going to see that growth yet, you know, for reading because this is at least at the elementary level, this is like year one of the program.

209
00:24:41,849 --> 00:24:50,431
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think, and then there is the piece of, to your point, like the observational and the instruction and the fidelity to the program.

210
00:24:50,451 --> 00:24:52,832
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think it's important to,

211
00:24:54,980 --> 00:25:07,847
[SPEAKER_08]: continue this conversation so that it is in a more formalized manner, but I would offer other people to kind of chime in if they feel.

212
00:25:07,907 --> 00:25:08,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

213
00:25:08,628 --> 00:25:08,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

214
00:25:08,748 --> 00:25:18,333
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would love to hear from the folks on the ground there as, you know, is, is MAP testing giving you the information you need and what other information do you need?

215
00:25:18,373 --> 00:25:19,974
[SPEAKER_03]: What are, what are the ways to get that?

216
00:25:21,481 --> 00:25:27,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think as we all know, we don't want to just make test scores the measure of success.

217
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:29,447
[SPEAKER_03]: What are the metrics we need here?

218
00:25:29,467 --> 00:25:33,991
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you hear me?

219
00:25:35,358 --> 00:25:35,678
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

220
00:25:36,038 --> 00:25:36,319
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

221
00:25:37,099 --> 00:25:41,021
[SPEAKER_11]: Just may I answer a piece of that that you were asking, right?

222
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:41,962
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

223
00:25:42,182 --> 00:25:53,188
[SPEAKER_11]: I do think one of the things we've been really successful with is triangulating the map data with other data points that we have within the classroom.

224
00:25:53,308 --> 00:25:55,389
[SPEAKER_11]: So we've done some really good work.

225
00:25:56,509 --> 00:25:59,291
[SPEAKER_11]: Many people on this call who, and beyond,

226
00:25:59,831 --> 00:26:15,341
[SPEAKER_11]: where we look at how are they performing on map in terms of their growth from fall to winter to spring, but not just looking at that data point, triangulating that for literacy, the dibbles, and then taking it a step further and cross referencing back to MCAS.

227
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:18,503
[SPEAKER_11]: Those are some data points as well as performance within the classroom.

228
00:26:18,523 --> 00:26:23,146
[SPEAKER_11]: Those are some data points that are gonna kind of give us an indicator of where do we need tier two support?

229
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:27,469
[SPEAKER_11]: Where are we, you know, what components are we thriving in?

230
00:26:27,489 --> 00:26:28,810
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's been very interesting

231
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:32,631
[SPEAKER_11]: when we've been able to look at those data points together.

232
00:26:33,252 --> 00:26:45,217
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm not sure if that answers your question, but I have found it very useful to see where we have some students that may be at risk, that maybe we weren't aware of.

233
00:26:45,577 --> 00:26:57,502
[SPEAKER_11]: And then when we go back with the team, we can mention in the programs themselves, go from there.

234
00:27:00,972 --> 00:27:14,759
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I could piggyback on what Nicole just started sharing, to say that as I think about the NWEA map, the other assessments, in particular the MCAS,

235
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:21,422
[SPEAKER_04]: The common complaint about the MCAS is that it's only given once a year at the end of the year.

236
00:27:21,882 --> 00:27:32,347
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you're not able to really target the areas that were identified as areas of weakness because the students change grades, the standards continue to evolve.

237
00:27:33,047 --> 00:27:41,738
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's kind of like you're working backwards, but you're not working really strategically because every year there can be a shift.

238
00:27:42,459 --> 00:27:50,889
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think in the absence of not having had a consistent assessment tool across the district at all,

239
00:27:52,551 --> 00:28:06,124
[SPEAKER_04]: To finally have NWEA MAP as a tool that you can use as one measure, but a measure that you can use multiple times in a given year to get that beginning, middle, and end.

240
00:28:06,905 --> 00:28:30,340
[SPEAKER_04]: and you can still do the mid-checkpoints and there are a lot of other assessments and different ways that the data can be sliced, that you can really use it to inform your instruction and make real-time changes instead of waiting until you get the MCAS results the following year and you're looking at different students that are sitting right in front of you.

241
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:43,066
[SPEAKER_04]: So as we're looking at data and the data is being triangulated, it's critically important to say we now have data, how can we make it actionable?

242
00:28:43,826 --> 00:28:56,432
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that as we're looking at curriculum and different programs, the programs can always shift, but if everything is aligned to the standards and we are actually able to measure growth,

243
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:01,202
[SPEAKER_04]: those are the conversations that will happen with data teams.

244
00:29:01,242 --> 00:29:06,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are the conversations that are going to give us improved outcomes for our students.

245
00:29:07,486 --> 00:29:13,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Because with the absence of data, you don't know, are your students really making adequate growth?

246
00:29:14,491 --> 00:29:19,314
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I will continue to champion NWEA MAP.

247
00:29:20,915 --> 00:29:23,557
[SPEAKER_04]: And if the district were to choose a different

248
00:29:24,645 --> 00:29:35,067
[SPEAKER_04]: assessment tool, it would need to be something that you could use to get multiple points of data so you could measure your progress and your growth.

249
00:29:35,428 --> 00:29:41,429
[SPEAKER_04]: And I feel like the work that's happening now is the work that we needed to be doing.

250
00:29:41,609 --> 00:29:54,012
[SPEAKER_04]: And now that we have it and people know what to expect with these assessments, you're really going to be able to be targeted, specific, laser-like focus in terms of

251
00:29:54,872 --> 00:29:58,616
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, my students did not get this particular standard.

252
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,777
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to reteach it.

253
00:30:00,438 --> 00:30:14,953
[SPEAKER_04]: And those are like the really rich conversations that happen either in grade level teams or if you're looking at it from a school level to be able to say, are there trends that our students are not making progress with or

254
00:30:15,473 --> 00:30:25,217
[SPEAKER_04]: look at everyone is hitting these particular standards and we're doing very well in these areas, let's keep up the good work here and make the necessary shifts.

255
00:30:25,737 --> 00:30:38,362
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know we're talking specifically about NWEA map, which again is norm referenced and it's a national assessment, but even if it was an NWEA map, we would still need to have

256
00:30:39,423 --> 00:30:46,218
[SPEAKER_04]: something that we could measure more than once a year while the students are still in front of their educators.

257
00:30:47,445 --> 00:30:49,906
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's yeah, and I just don't want to lose sight of.

258
00:30:50,427 --> 00:30:55,189
[SPEAKER_03]: So the scope of this meeting is about assessing the curricula, not necessarily student gains.

259
00:30:55,289 --> 00:31:07,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, part of the goal of these curricula is to reflect student gains, but to make sure that we're measuring something that tells us whether the goals of adopting a given curriculum are being met.

260
00:31:07,395 --> 00:31:09,516
[SPEAKER_03]: But I see hands in the air, so I think Ms.

261
00:31:09,536 --> 00:31:10,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Demos was first.

262
00:31:16,152 --> 00:31:16,993
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, did we lose her?

263
00:31:17,233 --> 00:31:17,653
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you're up.

264
00:31:18,274 --> 00:31:19,075
[SPEAKER_08]: You're on mute Shannon.

265
00:31:19,535 --> 00:31:20,616
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I thought I clicked it.

266
00:31:21,817 --> 00:31:23,699
[SPEAKER_09]: So, thank you for the opportunity.

267
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:30,746
[SPEAKER_09]: Dr. Vincent actually took a little bit of what I was going to say, but what I wanted to say, so it echoes the fact that.

268
00:31:31,947 --> 00:31:42,900
[SPEAKER_09]: The scores really drive a lot of our instruction in differentiation and groupings here, and I'm sure for my colleagues across the district as well.

269
00:31:43,741 --> 00:31:51,230
[SPEAKER_09]: It allows us to have conversations during our and our CPTs with the staff, and it really kind of drives.

270
00:31:51,710 --> 00:32:02,620
[SPEAKER_09]: along the discussions of okay what is this new program covering that our old curriculum didn't but then where are the gaps that we need to put in some tiered support across the grade levels.

271
00:32:03,081 --> 00:32:10,208
[SPEAKER_09]: It allows me as the instructional leader of the school to see are these trends something that is across the grade level

272
00:32:10,748 --> 00:32:20,234
[SPEAKER_09]: or is it something that I need to go and have some support conversations with my individual staffs that maybe a little bit needs a little bit more guidance versus somebody else.

273
00:32:20,254 --> 00:32:25,817
[SPEAKER_09]: So I really encourage us to continue with this because that beginning, middle, and end data

274
00:32:26,457 --> 00:32:34,340
[SPEAKER_09]: is a big point for us as far as our groupings for next year, for our next week's centers.

275
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,301
[SPEAKER_09]: We get so much data from it.

276
00:32:37,281 --> 00:32:42,483
[SPEAKER_09]: I really do appreciate the fact that we were given this resource and I hope to see it continue.

277
00:32:43,763 --> 00:32:44,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

278
00:32:44,604 --> 00:32:45,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Texera.

279
00:32:48,003 --> 00:32:48,403
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

280
00:32:48,824 --> 00:32:51,285
[SPEAKER_06]: So we use the map data a little bit differently.

281
00:32:51,885 --> 00:33:01,411
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll have all of our students, whether they're newcomers or Yale pullout students, they take the math map test because that's informing us.

282
00:33:01,551 --> 00:33:08,716
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, fifth grade looks different in Brazil than it does in China, than it does in the U.S.

283
00:33:09,236 --> 00:33:15,220
[SPEAKER_06]: So because it is based on the standards, we can target what our students are missing, not due to

284
00:33:16,307 --> 00:33:23,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Lack of instruction here, but what they didn't get in their countries prior to coming in because we place them by grade level.

285
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:31,013
[SPEAKER_06]: So if they're in seventh grade and they missed seven fifth grade skills, we can hone in on that using the map data.

286
00:33:31,887 --> 00:33:42,190
[SPEAKER_06]: And then for the ELA map, only our pull-out students who are level 3-4 EL or higher will take the map ELA test.

287
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:45,990
[SPEAKER_06]: And we use that data to make our placement decisions.

288
00:33:46,811 --> 00:33:55,733
[SPEAKER_06]: If they're ready to exit from the EL program, it's another piece of data in addition to the access test, if we can place them in mainstream classrooms.

289
00:33:56,593 --> 00:34:00,518
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we also just, we use the science in a similar way.

290
00:34:01,179 --> 00:34:12,752
[SPEAKER_06]: MCAS is just fifth and eighth grade there, but it helps us kind of hone in on what skills that they may be missing because of cultural differences with educational systems in different countries.

291
00:34:18,365 --> 00:34:28,610
[SPEAKER_03]: And sorry, Mr. Tixera, the list that we just saw from Dr. Galussi of the curricula, how many of those have the built-in ELA support?

292
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:32,411
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it was included versus a separate curriculum.

293
00:34:32,912 --> 00:34:37,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so we do have a separate ELD curriculum, English language development curriculum.

294
00:34:38,054 --> 00:34:47,218
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not sure, I have a different list that I added and I may have missed this, Suzanne, as you were going through it, I didn't add my stuff.

295
00:34:47,845 --> 00:34:54,069
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have English language development curriculum based on students' grade level and their English language proficiency level.

296
00:34:54,489 --> 00:35:17,143
[SPEAKER_06]: And so currently right now, what's happening in the elementary, because we now have a new program into reading, the HMH program, our EL curriculum hasn't changed, but we're updating the curriculum to support the new materials being used to deliver that curriculum.

297
00:35:24,025 --> 00:35:24,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

298
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:24,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Khan.

299
00:35:26,626 --> 00:35:27,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Real quick.

300
00:35:28,087 --> 00:35:28,687
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you hear me?

301
00:35:29,167 --> 00:35:29,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

302
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:30,568
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

303
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,208
[SPEAKER_05]: So good.

304
00:35:31,268 --> 00:35:35,190
[SPEAKER_05]: So I want to bring another perspective to map testing.

305
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:50,537
[SPEAKER_05]: I use it very often also to see how I can support the teachers because every teacher's classroom is different and all the teacher, every classroom, because by the nature of it, have different set of students.

306
00:35:51,097 --> 00:36:04,060
[SPEAKER_05]: And that gives me a look into how I can support a particular teacher when I look at two similar classrooms and see, all right, this is where my PD needs are.

307
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,060
[SPEAKER_05]: This is how I need to coach.

308
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:10,061
[SPEAKER_05]: So I use it in that capacity as well.

309
00:36:11,842 --> 00:36:12,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

310
00:36:13,342 --> 00:36:13,922
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Tucci.

311
00:36:15,458 --> 00:36:29,881
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, hi, just from a secondary school leader perspective, I'll just chime in to almost echo what Dr. Kayser was saying, but expand upon it too as well, and that we use a lot of the triangulation data in order to inform our approach as to how to utilize our wind block over the course of the school year.

312
00:36:30,401 --> 00:36:40,563
[SPEAKER_01]: So oftentimes what you'll see is that teachers will work with separate different groups of students, and we'll have different intervention kind of groups within a team-based wind block opportunity for our students.

313
00:36:41,303 --> 00:36:42,724
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was one thing that hadn't been mentioned.

314
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:51,051
[SPEAKER_01]: And also one other thing that hadn't been mentioned by my colleagues is how I feel like the map growth data can be very useful as a great resource for families too as well.

315
00:36:51,392 --> 00:36:53,053
[SPEAKER_01]: Oftentimes we're having family meetings.

316
00:36:53,954 --> 00:37:02,361
[SPEAKER_01]: We love to be able to present the map growth data in the family report and be able to share that information to work in partnership with our families in the work that we do.

317
00:37:02,661 --> 00:37:02,922
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

318
00:37:04,378 --> 00:37:04,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

319
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:17,149
[SPEAKER_03]: That actually, if anyone else has comments, I welcome them, but that seems like a reasonable transition to identify Oh, Dr. Sorry, I just I wanted to add because I know I broke up before so hopefully you can hear me better now.

320
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:40,941
[SPEAKER_02]: We have an example of how we related the data to the curriculum, which I believe is kind of one of your questions, was when we saw a deficit, NWEA, when we first began it, and we saw a deficit in the foundational reading skills, we did pull in ECRI, our Enhanced Core Reading Instruction, as more of a foundational program, and we did see

321
00:37:42,182 --> 00:37:51,308
[SPEAKER_02]: success in the student scores, which then told us that ECRI, you know, was one of the tools that was successful in that.

322
00:37:51,708 --> 00:37:58,152
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that, you know, Dr. Gluzzi has done a lot of work with, along with myself, on continuing that as it seemed protective.

323
00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:05,857
[SPEAKER_02]: But that is an example of how the assessment helped not just speak to the student, but also to the curriculum, if that's what you were referencing.

324
00:38:06,657 --> 00:38:07,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that is.

325
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:18,916
[SPEAKER_03]: And that speaks to the other kind of takeaway I wanted to get from this, which is the timeline of when that, it sounds like map provides a lot of flexibility for doing a lot of that in real time.

326
00:38:19,496 --> 00:38:24,760
[SPEAKER_03]: And if that is embedded in the process, I don't know how much more explicit it needs to be.

327
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:32,645
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm interested in identifying who are the stakeholders in making those decisions and getting that input.

328
00:38:32,705 --> 00:38:37,308
[SPEAKER_03]: I know when curricula is chosen, it's done with community input from families.

329
00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:47,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, most of the folks in families are not educators or curriculum developers, but they can speak to the experiential component of things.

330
00:38:49,455 --> 00:38:55,818
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, the teachers who are teaching it saying this is working, this is not working, anecdotally, qualitatively.

331
00:38:56,818 --> 00:39:08,843
[SPEAKER_03]: So identifying who those parties are and when they come into the review process, I think would be a useful exercise for this call.

332
00:39:10,738 --> 00:39:26,214
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we agree, and I know that when we've engaged in the curriculum review cycle for, let's just say, a new program, new curriculum, following that core review process has always included

333
00:39:29,057 --> 00:39:40,081
[SPEAKER_08]: varied stakeholders, so it has always included administration as well as teachers and caregivers, but we haven't really had anything necessarily formalized.

334
00:39:42,662 --> 00:40:05,336
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that just taking that process, we have a slight draft of what that process looks like, but I think what you're speaking about is that final part of the process where you're in the implementation phase, but then that implementation phase also leads into the monitoring phase.

335
00:40:07,306 --> 00:40:14,088
[SPEAKER_08]: What does that look like as we're monitoring the curriculum to see how it's meeting the needs of our students?

336
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:25,972
[SPEAKER_08]: And when that varied use of stakeholders kind of enters that monitoring phase, I do think is worthy of discussion.

337
00:40:26,413 --> 00:40:32,775
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think it's going to look different at each level and at each department.

338
00:40:34,158 --> 00:40:37,822
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think you use data to kind of guide those discussions.

339
00:40:37,882 --> 00:40:51,895
[SPEAKER_08]: So right now we're seeing some positive, like just for example, not to always kind of like say something to FISA, but like we're seeing some like positive data around the math.

340
00:40:53,196 --> 00:40:56,099
[SPEAKER_08]: But in terms of, you know,

341
00:40:56,683 --> 00:41:03,647
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, so that math piece is in the monitoring phase that will stay in the monitoring phase for a couple more years.

342
00:41:05,768 --> 00:41:13,252
[SPEAKER_08]: But if we see a dip in that student data, then it's going to warrant a closer eye.

343
00:41:13,272 --> 00:41:25,038
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think the other piece, like to my point, is that some of that other data around like triangulation, especially maybe just for FISA's piece, but for all the departments,

344
00:41:26,445 --> 00:41:42,775
[SPEAKER_08]: is I would also welcome a conversation around trajectory data, because I think that part of the push for math was because FISA was seeing some data about the preparedness of students in advanced opportunities.

345
00:41:43,695 --> 00:41:55,321
[SPEAKER_08]: in like grades, you know, I guess 9, 10 and on, as well as what the enrollment looks like in some of our advanced placement classes, honors and AP.

346
00:41:55,802 --> 00:42:01,385
[SPEAKER_08]: FISA and curriculum directors are also monitoring the

347
00:42:02,345 --> 00:42:05,087
[SPEAKER_08]: scores that our students are receiving on AP exams.

348
00:42:05,567 --> 00:42:19,997
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I think even just having a conversation around the kind of data that's important to make some of these decisions beyond map data also would be a worthwhile discussion.

349
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:27,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there thoughts from the group on that?

350
00:42:29,887 --> 00:42:39,660
[SPEAKER_03]: And also giving some attention to those to non-MCAS subjects as well, I think is, I know we've been talking about NWEA MAP, but.

351
00:42:40,903 --> 00:42:46,984
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, a lot of the math and the literacy is baked into things where there's a little more.

352
00:42:47,004 --> 00:43:02,508
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to say leeway in other programs, because it is they're absolutely rigorous and to standards, but how can we make sure that's being included in this process, and that those programs are getting what they need.

353
00:43:11,818 --> 00:43:20,185
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that also varies from department to department, like world language, Dr. Bebeau, there's like the seal of biliteracy.

354
00:43:20,205 --> 00:43:27,451
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, there are AP courses as well, but there's also the seal of biliteracy.

355
00:43:27,551 --> 00:43:32,355
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there's also just, there's enrollment.

356
00:43:33,545 --> 00:43:59,118
[SPEAKER_08]: And so at least at the high school level where students have a choice, starting in grade 10 with really like what they're taking as both like electives and just enrollment in course selection is also useful data for us to kind of track, you know, the interest in students as well as the persistence.

357
00:44:04,937 --> 00:44:07,498
[SPEAKER_08]: but I do defer to my experts on the call.

358
00:44:08,378 --> 00:44:16,942
[SPEAKER_02]: I would agree just from the social studies perspective, which we do have an eighth grade MCAS pilot this year, but not, you know, anything set in stone.

359
00:44:17,422 --> 00:44:19,523
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we see it with the civics project.

360
00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:24,826
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a civics learning project that's mandatory for our eighth graders and our 11th graders.

361
00:44:25,326 --> 00:44:29,828
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we look at the quality of those projects and then the engagement after, you know, for me,

362
00:44:30,808 --> 00:44:36,032
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, of course, beyond numbers of how well somebody did on an assessment, but are they engaged?

363
00:44:36,232 --> 00:44:41,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they, you know, moving on to more civics-oriented projects once they hit eighth grade?

364
00:44:41,655 --> 00:44:52,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are valuable pieces of data that we look at as a department as well, along with, of course, you know, the civics project and what they're doing within the classroom.

365
00:44:57,722 --> 00:44:58,122
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

366
00:44:58,162 --> 00:45:07,008
[SPEAKER_03]: And that speaks to another question I had for this group, which is the cross-departmental influence, right?

367
00:45:07,168 --> 00:45:09,250
[SPEAKER_03]: I see Mr. Cieri is on the call.

368
00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:16,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Do our students taking advanced science classes have the advanced math skills that they need to do that?

369
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:18,977
[SPEAKER_03]: And what room in reviewing curricula of saying,

370
00:45:19,976 --> 00:45:36,943
[SPEAKER_03]: The next grade is getting students are coming in with the knowledge that they need to succeed at this grade and with this curriculum or looking at across you know do a piece does the statistics department have the statistics students have these math skills or these critical thinking skills that come from a humanities program.

371
00:45:38,243 --> 00:45:55,933
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm wondering what cross-curricular opportunities there are to say this is a program that speaks to multiple needs and certainly at the elementary school level, foundational math, foundational reading, but being able to make those connections across areas.

372
00:45:55,953 --> 00:46:00,775
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Rocco and Fiza could speak to that.

373
00:46:00,815 --> 00:46:03,817
[SPEAKER_08]: They work very closely on that.

374
00:46:05,748 --> 00:46:06,569
[SPEAKER_03]: do either of you wanna?

375
00:46:07,450 --> 00:46:14,096
[SPEAKER_03]: And particularly in terms of being able to review curricula with that in mind, not just are the students getting these things, but.

376
00:46:16,358 --> 00:46:18,840
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Ms.

377
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:22,223
[SPEAKER_00]: Renfield, your question is, it's twofold.

378
00:46:22,323 --> 00:46:24,245
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what the

379
00:46:26,588 --> 00:46:31,471
[SPEAKER_00]: what the curriculum offers and what it expects as a baseline.

380
00:46:34,453 --> 00:46:49,704
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, if you are choosing something in science, you have to make sure that the reading level of the material is appropriate, that the math reasoning skills are appropriate, and is there crossover within those documents about

381
00:46:51,784 --> 00:46:55,806
[SPEAKER_00]: what can be done with the curriculum that's in place.

382
00:46:56,506 --> 00:47:03,088
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is absolutely something that we're aware of when we do our reviews.

383
00:47:05,629 --> 00:47:08,330
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked at the document very briefly.

384
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:15,912
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't recall if that point is embedded in the curriculum review process as

385
00:47:17,633 --> 00:47:27,053
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in the newest document that you have, but it would be really valuable to put in there as a point of reference that, you know, looking at.

386
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:38,742
[SPEAKER_00]: know the range of Lexile levels of the materials would be good to know before a curriculum is purchased or implemented.

387
00:47:39,722 --> 00:47:44,563
[SPEAKER_00]: The same for the math skills when you're looking at a science program.

388
00:47:44,943 --> 00:47:50,625
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking more in particular as K to 8 rather than the high school because at the

389
00:47:52,986 --> 00:48:06,841
[SPEAKER_00]: At the elective level, after chemistry, the expectation is that students have a particular level of mathematical or at least computational skill that sometimes may

390
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:20,465
[SPEAKER_00]: may say that this particular alternative that they're choosing may not match, may not be well aligned to what their skill set is.

391
00:48:20,565 --> 00:48:23,207
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's certainly in the mix.

392
00:48:23,787 --> 00:48:31,652
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm thinking at the more advanced classes, the AP class in physics, for example, where you need to have

393
00:48:32,512 --> 00:48:36,533
[SPEAKER_00]: simultaneous instruction in calculus.

394
00:48:37,113 --> 00:48:47,736
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have to have simultaneous instruction in calculus and the book has calculus in it, and it's a physics course, then how do students reach that level?

395
00:48:48,436 --> 00:48:50,436
[SPEAKER_00]: The text has to be that particular level.

396
00:48:52,257 --> 00:48:55,998
[SPEAKER_00]: Which groups of students are qualified to reach that particular level?

397
00:48:56,978 --> 00:49:01,661
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a big range and there's a lot that probably has to be considered.

398
00:49:02,442 --> 00:49:24,155
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would certainly put in there that when a curriculum is reviewed, are we looking for the alignment grade level or at least grade band level for the students in their ELA or their linguistic background and in their mathematical understanding.

399
00:49:25,793 --> 00:49:30,437
[SPEAKER_03]: And that taps into a question that we had brought up earlier of, is it the material?

400
00:49:30,637 --> 00:49:31,818
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it the implementation?

401
00:49:31,838 --> 00:49:33,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it the instruction?

402
00:49:33,099 --> 00:49:43,506
[SPEAKER_03]: And really being able to assess it out, because we don't want to throw out a curriculum that has a lot of potential and would be doing well if there were more training.

403
00:49:44,567 --> 00:49:48,570
[SPEAKER_03]: But we also don't want to keep hammering away at a curriculum that isn't working.

404
00:49:50,652 --> 00:49:53,494
[SPEAKER_03]: So I saw two hands go up, although one of them, I think, just went down.

405
00:49:56,106 --> 00:49:56,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Pfizer.

406
00:49:58,451 --> 00:50:06,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I wanted to add that there are certain standards in mathematics.

407
00:50:08,353 --> 00:50:13,178
[SPEAKER_05]: in which we can work cross-content.

408
00:50:13,198 --> 00:50:24,549
[SPEAKER_05]: So for example, in geometry, this is something that connects very well with certain shops that we have at Medford Vocational Technical High School.

409
00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:31,316
[SPEAKER_05]: So just recently, the mathematics department has been working on

410
00:50:32,127 --> 00:50:40,076
[SPEAKER_05]: creating more projects at least once a quarter in every subject that

411
00:50:41,578 --> 00:50:47,022
[SPEAKER_05]: is going to involve some kind of cross-content partnership.

412
00:50:47,523 --> 00:50:50,085
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been encouraging teachers to do that.

413
00:50:50,205 --> 00:50:51,566
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a work in progress.

414
00:50:52,026 --> 00:50:55,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Some courses have one done, others have a couple done.

415
00:50:56,730 --> 00:51:03,375
[SPEAKER_05]: We just kicked it off after COVID, so it's taking time, but we are getting there.

416
00:51:04,196 --> 00:51:09,400
[SPEAKER_05]: The other thing that has been mentioned is the curriculum.

417
00:51:10,350 --> 00:51:19,854
[SPEAKER_05]: The three curriculums that we have, one is a pathway and the other two are the curriculums, illustrative mathematics and investigations.

418
00:51:20,955 --> 00:51:32,740
[SPEAKER_05]: We ensured that it's not just emphasizing on procedural stuff, because if it's just emphasizing on students' procedural understanding,

419
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:41,264
[SPEAKER_05]: then that doesn't leave any room for any kind of thinking and problem solving that comes in through these projects.

420
00:51:41,284 --> 00:51:57,353
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are working towards getting our students ready from very early age to be able to handle these cross-content projects that will come their way, maybe as early as middle school, but definitely at the high school level.

421
00:51:58,722 --> 00:52:12,926
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a potential, you know, we are always thinking of ways teachers are, I mean, we have a personal finance course, a consumer math course that involves, you know, some civics and some economics.

422
00:52:13,526 --> 00:52:19,448
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I'm very proud of those particular courses and teachers have worked hard to develop those curriculums.

423
00:52:19,968 --> 00:52:22,869
[SPEAKER_05]: So, as I said, it is potential, we are working on it.

424
00:52:23,109 --> 00:52:24,330
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a work in progress.

425
00:52:27,484 --> 00:52:42,760
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that's that's another great point that I think is not quite this meeting, but when a teacher brings a curriculum to the district and how that gets adopted, but and assessing that So that's a great point as well.

426
00:52:44,382 --> 00:52:44,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Nicole.

427
00:52:48,426 --> 00:53:00,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, you know, I just wanted to add, like, when we think about literacy across the content areas, we think about reading, as Mr. Cieri just said, and the levels and the ability to access.

428
00:53:01,541 --> 00:53:05,824
[SPEAKER_02]: informational texts versus fictional texts, but we also think about writing.

429
00:53:06,024 --> 00:53:17,070
[SPEAKER_02]: So looking at how our writing is crossing over curriculum is something that is really critical for social studies and English, but certainly

430
00:53:18,571 --> 00:53:18,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

431
00:53:18,791 --> 00:53:23,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Khan and Mr. Seary and I work closely to kind of think about those expectations.

432
00:53:23,873 --> 00:53:31,035
[SPEAKER_02]: At the middle school level, we can have team cross-curricular activities, which we certainly do with social studies and English.

433
00:53:31,995 --> 00:53:43,358
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the high school, we have some courses that are ones called humanities that's actually English and social studies, because the US history and the American lit lines up together.

434
00:53:43,478 --> 00:53:45,179
[SPEAKER_02]: So the class is combined.

435
00:53:45,959 --> 00:53:51,247
[SPEAKER_02]: But also with arts, we've seen a lot with social studies through the arts.

436
00:53:51,267 --> 00:53:53,009
[SPEAKER_02]: So working with

437
00:53:54,252 --> 00:53:59,376
[SPEAKER_02]: The arts coordinators, we have a class called Art and Ideas, looking at historical art.

438
00:53:59,416 --> 00:54:07,302
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have students that are doing like docent trainers at Museum of Fine Arts, which is kind of getting beyond those walls of the classroom and having that crossover.

439
00:54:07,962 --> 00:54:12,366
[SPEAKER_02]: But certainly getting back to the curriculum itself, that writing component is essential.

440
00:54:13,026 --> 00:54:16,349
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's something that I think we're constantly assessing.

441
00:54:16,949 --> 00:54:35,837
[SPEAKER_02]: because MAP isn't gonna tell us much about that, DIBLS isn't gonna tell us anything about that, but looking at student work and progress across the four areas and having something set up to do that regularly, I think is something that we've started on and need to continue with, if that makes sense.

442
00:54:37,097 --> 00:54:48,884
[SPEAKER_03]: It does and I think that was kind of the goal of this of getting this group together to have this conversation is to say what does that process look like and what is the timeline for that.

443
00:54:50,345 --> 00:54:58,030
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know if that becomes a question with with the strategic plan for the district as we said the the phase one is coming to

444
00:54:59,967 --> 00:55:05,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Coming to an end this year and knowing what that phase 2 is is something that.

445
00:55:07,173 --> 00:55:08,414
[SPEAKER_03]: I can speak for myself.

446
00:55:08,654 --> 00:55:10,816
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope the rest of the subcommittee agrees.

447
00:55:10,856 --> 00:55:11,797
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd like to know what.

448
00:55:13,178 --> 00:55:15,680
[SPEAKER_03]: As we approach the end of phase 1, what does phase 2 look like?

449
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:18,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's involved and what's the timeline?

450
00:55:22,762 --> 00:55:26,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I don't think there's like a definite answer for that right now.

451
00:55:26,924 --> 00:55:38,748
[SPEAKER_08]: I definitely welcome the continued conversation in a future meeting, but I know, I don't know if you want to end, I can kind of show like the draft for what that process looks like.

452
00:55:39,188 --> 00:55:39,769
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think

453
00:55:40,769 --> 00:55:51,762
[SPEAKER_08]: Following that process, as well as taking a deeper dive on the catalog of curricula that we have internally,

454
00:55:55,177 --> 00:56:06,025
[SPEAKER_08]: And in mind with your kind of like didactic structure right because it's that's the key we we've already well established that we have map growth and how it's used.

455
00:56:06,746 --> 00:56:11,509
[SPEAKER_08]: And the importance of the instruction and fidelity to the program, but then there is the importance of that.

456
00:56:12,350 --> 00:56:23,178
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, that third kind of piece of data, too, around the grade level performance, some of those internal factors that we're looking at, and observations that we conduct.

457
00:56:23,998 --> 00:56:28,021
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think the like the observational rounds, which have been

458
00:56:29,142 --> 00:56:31,543
[SPEAKER_08]: very effective in pockets.

459
00:56:33,204 --> 00:56:36,565
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Teixeira, Mr. Tucci, and Ms.

460
00:56:36,605 --> 00:56:38,206
[SPEAKER_08]: Khan, as well as others.

461
00:56:38,266 --> 00:56:40,947
[SPEAKER_08]: But they really took a deep dive on that.

462
00:56:41,087 --> 00:56:52,812
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's work that we can also build, as well as, I think, aligning to the ed reports and the curate process.

463
00:56:54,174 --> 00:57:01,281
[SPEAKER_08]: is the Department of Education pushes high quality grade level curriculum right across the board.

464
00:57:01,881 --> 00:57:18,696
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's very easy to kind of, I shouldn't say it's easy, but assessing grade level material when it's from a published program is one thing, but reviewing and assessing curriculum that is

465
00:57:19,834 --> 00:57:22,935
[SPEAKER_08]: created in-house is a different process.

466
00:57:23,035 --> 00:57:45,543
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's the process or some of the work that we could, that the district needs to like maybe look at too, because it's very clear the process from the Department of Education when you're assessing high quality materials that have already been created by a publisher, which we have many.

467
00:57:46,650 --> 00:58:04,478
[SPEAKER_08]: but assessing the high quality, I don't wanna say high quality NESS, but the high quality grade level piece of internally created curricula is a different structure.

468
00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:12,202
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that that's one that we could also discuss.

469
00:58:13,398 --> 00:58:16,740
[SPEAKER_08]: what that looks like will be different than what the other process looks like.

470
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:17,701
[SPEAKER_03]: And that makes sense.

471
00:58:17,941 --> 00:58:19,021
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm noting that it's six.

472
00:58:19,081 --> 00:58:21,683
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to see this draft.

473
00:58:22,504 --> 00:58:23,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, yeah.

474
00:58:23,304 --> 00:58:25,445
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do notice it is the time.

475
00:58:26,046 --> 00:58:39,534
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think, especially in those instances where we're looking at, I don't wanna call them Frankenstein curriculum, but to say there's a gap in this published material that we need to supplement with either something homegrown or some other published material, so.

476
00:58:40,908 --> 00:58:53,255
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I just I wanted to also just note that it's not going to look the same depending on the department or the grade level because, you know, there are some guiding questions.

477
00:58:53,355 --> 00:59:04,361
[SPEAKER_08]: But to Mr. Cieri's point, I loved his question about, you know, the difference between what a curriculum offers and what a curriculum expects.

478
00:59:06,442 --> 00:59:10,724
[SPEAKER_08]: I think since this is a draft, I would love to add that into our guiding questions somewhere.

479
00:59:11,244 --> 00:59:21,749
[SPEAKER_08]: But this basically just kind of takes into account the four phases when we're looking at assessing curriculum, which is what happens in the planning and the review.

480
00:59:22,829 --> 00:59:38,564
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have to read all of it, but this first box kind of gives the snapshot of what happens during this process, which is establishing the team of stakeholders that you spoke about, Member Reinfeld, and doing some of that preliminary work to know

481
00:59:40,181 --> 00:59:51,246
[SPEAKER_08]: what is the research saying about the current content so that the people on this team and all stakeholders kind of understand.

482
00:59:51,587 --> 01:00:04,353
[SPEAKER_08]: So to like Dr. Keyes' point earlier, if we were doing this on like early literacy screeners, we would really want to inform this group of stakeholders what is current research saying about the science of reading.

483
01:00:06,099 --> 01:00:16,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Then the second phase is like the analysis where we're looking at our internal data around all those triangulation pieces.

484
01:00:17,047 --> 01:00:27,274
[SPEAKER_08]: There are some links in here of things that we would be pulling in right away from student assessments to DESE guidance and of course alignment to our strategic plan.

485
01:00:28,327 --> 01:00:34,188
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the next phase is like making a determination about is the curriculum meeting the needs of students?

486
01:00:34,268 --> 01:00:35,288
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we need to move on?

487
01:00:35,328 --> 01:00:36,269
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we need to enhance?

488
01:00:36,889 --> 01:00:38,729
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it time to look for a new program?

489
01:00:38,749 --> 01:00:45,490
[SPEAKER_08]: And the team would be making those decisions to chart a path forward.

490
01:00:46,051 --> 01:00:53,812
[SPEAKER_08]: And then this is the very long part here because it's not only the implementation, but it's the monitoring.

491
01:00:54,552 --> 01:00:58,053
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is where we can live for like

492
01:00:58,933 --> 01:01:08,879
[SPEAKER_08]: three to four years as we're kind of implementing a program and continuously kind of like progress monitoring it.

493
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:22,187
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think this is where a lot of the work, per how you've kind of phrased this, you would like to live in kind of like this section of the work.

494
01:01:23,225 --> 01:01:26,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, although I will say I love the reasons for initiation.

495
01:01:26,066 --> 01:01:30,927
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's really important to make explicit that some of it is scheduled.

496
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:33,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of it is emerging, right?

497
01:01:34,268 --> 01:01:35,849
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of it is external.

498
01:01:36,909 --> 01:01:39,290
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, yes, beyond our control, yeah.

499
01:01:41,310 --> 01:01:46,152
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you have a target timeline for this process from adoption to?

500
01:01:48,692 --> 01:01:50,293
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you talking about for this draft?

501
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:56,527
[SPEAKER_03]: For these stages, you said we could spend a few years in implementation and monitoring.

502
01:01:57,588 --> 01:01:57,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there?

503
01:01:58,490 --> 01:02:04,198
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I think this is like the crosswalk of this to this.

504
01:02:05,737 --> 01:02:08,018
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I almost view this a little bit, right?

505
01:02:08,578 --> 01:02:13,579
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's going to look different at each level within each department.

506
01:02:14,019 --> 01:02:20,681
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that's part of the work that we're all doing internally.

507
01:02:22,161 --> 01:02:32,884
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think that I would like to work on firming this up with the administration, the school and department leaders, as well as

508
01:02:34,377 --> 01:02:50,396
[SPEAKER_08]: kind of narrowing in a little bit more on this so that we can see what the... Eventually, I think we need to also have something posted so that it's very clear on our website year by year.

509
01:02:52,685 --> 01:02:53,385
[SPEAKER_08]: where we are.

510
01:02:53,465 --> 01:03:00,328
[SPEAKER_08]: So like 2024, if it was up on our website, we could see that this is year two at the elementary level.

511
01:03:00,368 --> 01:03:01,428
[SPEAKER_08]: It's year two for math.

512
01:03:02,689 --> 01:03:05,029
[SPEAKER_08]: It's year four for FOSS.

513
01:03:05,410 --> 01:03:07,070
[SPEAKER_08]: I think, Rocco, four or five?

514
01:03:07,130 --> 01:03:07,390
[SPEAKER_08]: Four.

515
01:03:07,410 --> 01:03:09,731
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's five.

516
01:03:09,891 --> 01:03:13,232
[SPEAKER_03]: My daughter was in second grade and my other one's in third now, so.

517
01:03:13,652 --> 01:03:15,253
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

518
01:03:16,393 --> 01:03:18,814
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's year one for interreading, right?

519
01:03:18,954 --> 01:03:20,055
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

520
01:03:20,435 --> 01:03:20,875
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think,

521
01:03:22,403 --> 01:03:27,874
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to be able to build that so that there is a clear understanding of where we are.

522
01:03:27,894 --> 01:03:33,786
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, there is, you know, you can't go on the Department of Education, but they only list

523
01:03:35,369 --> 01:03:36,629
[SPEAKER_08]: reading, math, and science.

524
01:03:37,089 --> 01:03:40,210
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think it's fully up to date because it's not your uses.

525
01:03:40,810 --> 01:03:41,291
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

526
01:03:41,811 --> 01:03:42,651
[SPEAKER_08]: We have to update it.

527
01:03:44,271 --> 01:03:46,772
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think there should be something on our website as well.

528
01:03:47,152 --> 01:03:47,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

529
01:03:47,432 --> 01:03:47,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

530
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:56,315
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's useful for this, if not the subcommittee or even the entire school committee to know when is it reasonable to say, all right, into readings been in place now.

531
01:03:57,035 --> 01:03:57,795
[SPEAKER_03]: We need this up.

532
01:03:57,835 --> 01:04:00,616
[SPEAKER_03]: We need an update on whether it's achieved its goals.

533
01:04:01,596 --> 01:04:04,217
[SPEAKER_03]: or not, because I know school committee approves.

534
01:04:04,337 --> 01:04:09,660
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't teach, we don't tell teachers how to teach, but we do approve major investments in curricula.

535
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:18,624
[SPEAKER_03]: And so knowing when it's reasonable to see those updates, that data, those data, I know people argue about.

536
01:04:19,004 --> 01:04:21,105
[SPEAKER_08]: Best practices of five to six years.

537
01:04:21,145 --> 01:04:21,345
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

538
01:04:23,146 --> 01:04:27,908
[SPEAKER_03]: And so mapping out where those are for the various curricula that

539
01:04:29,427 --> 01:04:34,771
[SPEAKER_08]: So to that point, we should be looking at FOS.

540
01:04:34,951 --> 01:04:40,776
[SPEAKER_08]: That should be one of the next focus areas for elementary.

541
01:04:43,998 --> 01:04:48,982
[SPEAKER_08]: But I want to be able to create that cycle so that we can see on a yearly basis where we are.

542
01:04:49,002 --> 01:04:54,586
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that would be very helpful.

543
01:04:57,631 --> 01:05:00,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Did anyone else have anything to add?

544
01:05:00,553 --> 01:05:13,220
[SPEAKER_03]: I know this was kind of a preliminary meeting and it was for many of you laying out some of the things that you've been already working on for a couple of new school committee members, but it is very much appreciated, especially after hours.

545
01:05:14,661 --> 01:05:17,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Branley or Member Ruseau, did you have any other questions that you

546
01:05:20,227 --> 01:05:20,908
[SPEAKER_03]: wanted to bring.

547
01:05:21,068 --> 01:05:24,090
[SPEAKER_10]: I can just add that I'm definitely not an expert in curriculum.

548
01:05:24,130 --> 01:05:24,751
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you.

549
01:05:26,112 --> 01:05:26,852
[SPEAKER_10]: I took my notes.

550
01:05:27,833 --> 01:05:28,714
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys are rock stars.

551
01:05:28,734 --> 01:05:29,735
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you.

552
01:05:31,316 --> 01:05:31,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

553
01:05:32,617 --> 01:05:34,018
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think I am Oh, go ahead.

554
01:05:38,622 --> 01:05:39,362
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm excited.

555
01:05:39,402 --> 01:05:46,768
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited to see this this next stage of the process laid out and to understand where we are with the various curricula so that we can

556
01:05:48,717 --> 01:05:57,819
[SPEAKER_03]: We can come to you when it when it is appropriate and not make extra work asking questions and when we when they're not when the answer is forthcoming.

557
01:05:57,839 --> 01:06:00,699
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.

558
01:06:08,521 --> 01:06:08,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

559
01:06:10,561 --> 01:06:11,801
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Branley member.

560
01:06:18,599 --> 01:06:20,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to adjourn, is there a second?

561
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:21,261
[SPEAKER_07]: Second.

562
01:06:22,381 --> 01:06:24,122
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, roll call.

[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

567
01:06:30,305 --> 01:06:31,025
