[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, yes, that's not something that the petitioners asked the table this so moved.

10
00:00:48,477 --> 00:00:51,998
[SPEAKER_13]: Who is the vice chairman of licensing?

11
00:00:54,019 --> 00:00:56,740
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there anyone from the licensing committee here?

[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry, what are the proposed hours of operation?

[SPEAKER_13]: Five to 11, okay.

31

[SPEAKER_16]: So we should expect to see an extended hours request sometime in the future.

32
00:02:14,559 --> 00:02:19,963
[SPEAKER_15]: Will there be any alcohol served on the premises, or is there an application for a license to serve any alcohol?

33
00:02:20,683 --> 00:02:21,104
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry?

34
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,384
[SPEAKER_15]: A license to serve any alcohol?

[SPEAKER_02]: No alcohol.

36
00:02:24,826 --> 00:02:27,128
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a dining option, or is this exclusively takeout?

37
00:02:31,476 --> 00:02:38,297
[SPEAKER_20]: people will be eating in the restaurant and so it's going to be mostly takeout delivery.

38
00:02:38,938 --> 00:02:39,678
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, thank you.

39
00:02:41,218 --> 00:02:43,658
[SPEAKER_13]: Any further questions for the petitioners for the restaurants.

40
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:45,419
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

41
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:52,800
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, on the motion by Vice President night for approval, second and by second, second by Council of bears.

42
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,140
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor.

43
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:54,920
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

44
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,101
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed.

45
00:02:56,761 --> 00:02:57,481
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

46
00:02:57,521 --> 00:02:58,321
[SPEAKER_13]: Congratulations.

47
00:02:59,059 --> 00:03:00,380
[SPEAKER_13]: hope to hope to come by and see you soon.

48
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

49
00:03:02,802 --> 00:03:05,604
[SPEAKER_15]: One last item, Mr. President.

50
00:03:05,624 --> 00:03:10,368
[SPEAKER_15]: 21561 on the suspension item offered by President Caraviello relative to Vernon Street construction.

51
00:03:10,388 --> 00:03:12,049
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

52
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:14,031
[SPEAKER_13]: You want to change?

53
00:03:14,051 --> 00:03:14,771
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

54
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:15,672
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

55
00:03:15,692 --> 00:03:19,575
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a matter that's come to my attention.

56
00:03:29,814 --> 00:03:33,177
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of residents and I live in that neighborhood.

57
00:03:33,538 --> 00:03:46,169
[SPEAKER_13]: If anyone is driven by Vernon Street, you'll see that they're in the process of currently putting in a new sidewalks, some new curbing and the paving the street.

58
00:03:47,991 --> 00:03:52,115
[SPEAKER_13]: So, for those of you aren't familiar, Vernon Street is kind of cut in half.

59
00:03:53,824 --> 00:03:56,525
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd say it goes on the Mystic Street end versus the All Street end.

60
00:03:56,845 --> 00:04:00,586
[SPEAKER_13]: So one half of the street has granite curbing.

61
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:14,871
[SPEAKER_13]: The other half of the street, from what I'm told, was supposed to have granite curbing, and either the contractor wasn't able to get it, so they've decided to put in a concrete curb.

62
00:04:15,751 --> 00:04:17,772
[SPEAKER_13]: And anyone knows how good a concrete curb is.

63
00:04:18,936 --> 00:04:20,437
[SPEAKER_13]: One plow hits it, it's pretty much done.

64
00:04:20,857 --> 00:04:24,378
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's not so much the issue of the concrete curb.

65
00:04:24,438 --> 00:04:32,581
[SPEAKER_13]: The issue is you have historic homes there, and this is not the type of curbing that belongs in front of historic homes.

66
00:04:32,861 --> 00:04:34,642
[SPEAKER_13]: Everyone else in the city has granite curbs.

67
00:04:35,462 --> 00:04:38,323
[SPEAKER_13]: These residents deserve the same curbing as everybody else.

68
00:04:38,343 --> 00:04:44,025
[SPEAKER_13]: So I would motion that we have the city engineer

69
00:04:44,807 --> 00:04:47,089
[SPEAKER_13]: give us a report on why they don't have curbing.

70
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:51,072
[SPEAKER_13]: I know he said they couldn't get it.

71
00:04:51,913 --> 00:04:53,634
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know why they can't get it.

72
00:04:53,654 --> 00:04:54,975
[SPEAKER_13]: Everyone else seems to have curbing.

73
00:04:55,656 --> 00:05:13,811
[SPEAKER_13]: But it would be my motion to not pave that section of Vernon Street until a decision is made whether to put granite curbs in, because these people deserve it and their house, everyone else has it, versus the concrete curbing that is in the neighborhood now.

74
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,749
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you can run them in.

75
00:05:16,909 --> 00:05:17,789
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

76
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:20,931
[SPEAKER_15]: Chair recognizes Councilor Farquhar.

77
00:05:24,293 --> 00:05:27,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President, and I want to thank Councilor Caraviello for bringing this forward.

78
00:05:29,312 --> 00:05:40,735
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's anything I think that we have learned from the building of the schools down at the McGlynn complex the McGlynn in Andrew schools is that we should never use concrete curbing.

79
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:47,217
[SPEAKER_05]: If you take a look in the winter they get hit by the plows and they automatically just break up into a million pieces.

80
00:05:47,859 --> 00:05:49,840
[SPEAKER_05]: So it should be granted, it should always be granted.

81
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:59,423
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we live in New England, there's salt, there's plows every winter, and it's just a fact that concrete curbing is not going to last long at all.

82
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:01,984
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we're gonna do it, we should make sure we're doing it right.

83
00:06:02,504 --> 00:06:03,645
[SPEAKER_05]: It should be granted curbing.

84
00:06:03,705 --> 00:06:09,827
[SPEAKER_05]: I thank you for bringing this forward, and I eagerly await a response from the engineer's office.

85
00:06:09,867 --> 00:06:10,187
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

86
00:06:10,667 --> 00:06:13,688
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, I think we have some people in the audience who are in the neighborhood that may wanna speak.

87
00:06:13,908 --> 00:06:15,769
[SPEAKER_13]: Excellent, Mr. Chair, I recognize Councilor Morell.

88
00:06:16,124 --> 00:06:16,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

89
00:06:17,445 --> 00:06:23,669
[SPEAKER_08]: If I could also add to that request to the city engineer, I'm curious how often materials are switched out.

90
00:06:23,769 --> 00:06:32,195
[SPEAKER_08]: So if materials are approved in a contract, how often are we seeing them switched out without notice really other than residents alerting us or us seeing it ourselves?

91
00:06:35,498 --> 00:06:38,660
[SPEAKER_15]: You're offering that in the form of a motion, Councilor?

92
00:06:39,381 --> 00:06:39,581
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

93
00:06:40,061 --> 00:06:41,142
[SPEAKER_08]: If you'll allow an amendment.

94
00:06:41,562 --> 00:06:44,044
[SPEAKER_15]: Amendment, please.

95
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,901
[SPEAKER_17]: do you recognize this Councilor Marks?

96
00:06:50,261 --> 00:06:51,122
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

97
00:06:51,883 --> 00:06:54,525
[SPEAKER_17]: And I want to thank President Caraviello for bringing this issue up.

98
00:06:55,285 --> 00:06:59,389
[SPEAKER_17]: My line of questioning is similar to what Councilor Morell just offered.

99
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:06,515
[SPEAKER_17]: What was the job specification on this if it called for granted curbing, which I believe it did.

100
00:07:07,195 --> 00:07:09,297
[SPEAKER_17]: And according to the contractor,

101
00:07:09,687 --> 00:07:18,396
[SPEAKER_17]: They weren't able to get granted curbing, then to me, you would put in a temporary maybe concrete curbing until you're able to get the granted.

102
00:07:19,197 --> 00:07:21,280
[SPEAKER_17]: One does not take the place of the other.

103
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:29,528
[SPEAKER_17]: We were told recently that the structural integrity and in the building material, a similar nature.

104
00:07:32,415 --> 00:07:41,982
[SPEAKER_17]: concrete and granite curbing are not similar in nature, and I'm not a building expert, but I don't think you need to be a building expert to figure that out, Mr. President.

105
00:07:42,582 --> 00:07:54,130
[SPEAKER_17]: And if it's gonna stay this way, which I hope it's not, Mr. President, what is the difference in the contractual price that went out for bid with this particular company?

106
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:58,874
[SPEAKER_17]: And did the city approve the changing of materials?

107
00:07:59,818 --> 00:08:17,208
[SPEAKER_17]: That's key, because if you're a homeowner and they're going to do work on your home and decided to do you something of less of value and less equality, you would raise an issue right and say as a homeowner say, I didn't pay for that I paid for this, and the city should do the same as the President, and if it's a matter of waiting some time.

108
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:20,530
[SPEAKER_17]: until granite is available, then so be it.

109
00:08:21,011 --> 00:08:22,412
[SPEAKER_17]: But the job needs to be done right.

110
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:34,001
[SPEAKER_17]: As Councilor Falco mentioned, at the McGlynn Andrews School, we've had countless concerns regarding crumbling concrete curbing around that whole infrastructure.

111
00:08:34,402 --> 00:08:37,544
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's been a nightmare for public safety, Mr. President.

112
00:08:37,564 --> 00:08:40,427
[SPEAKER_17]: So I would just pose that question as well.

113
00:08:41,528 --> 00:08:45,311
[SPEAKER_17]: If the city did approve them to move forward and gave it the A-OK,

114
00:08:46,031 --> 00:08:54,516
[SPEAKER_17]: in that we as a community wait till granite is available in order to have that installed in place of the concrete curbing.

115
00:08:54,836 --> 00:08:55,677
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

116
00:08:55,837 --> 00:08:56,257
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor.

117
00:08:56,277 --> 00:08:58,158
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there anybody from the public that would like to speak on this issue?

118
00:09:00,319 --> 00:09:01,420
[SPEAKER_15]: Come right up, please.

119
00:09:03,241 --> 00:09:04,442
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address for the record, please, sir.

120
00:09:05,382 --> 00:09:07,083
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi, my name is Thomas Knackle.

121
00:09:07,263 --> 00:09:13,107
[SPEAKER_22]: I live at 1 Verne Street, where I've owned a home for over 40 years, and

122
00:09:14,048 --> 00:09:19,993
[SPEAKER_22]: I formerly lived at 56 Vernon Street where I lived for 15 or 20 years.

123
00:09:20,153 --> 00:09:23,515
[SPEAKER_22]: So I patrolled this neighborhood for a long time.

124
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:33,443
[SPEAKER_22]: And I don't think the issue is how well the granite stands up to concrete.

125
00:09:33,723 --> 00:09:36,045
[SPEAKER_22]: I think the issue is aesthetics.

126
00:09:36,866 --> 00:09:39,087
[SPEAKER_22]: These are beautiful historic homes.

127
00:09:40,448 --> 00:09:43,671
[SPEAKER_22]: Concrete just plain looks cheap.

128
00:09:44,508 --> 00:10:01,597
[SPEAKER_22]: in front of say the majestic McGill House or in front of Hastings Heights Park, where there is a beautiful rock retaining wall all around the park.

129
00:10:02,418 --> 00:10:13,104
[SPEAKER_22]: And then they put concrete barrier wall that looks like a drainage ditch on the Mystic Street side of the park.

130
00:10:15,728 --> 00:10:20,070
[SPEAKER_22]: You would never find that in the flats of Winchester.

131
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:21,930
[SPEAKER_22]: They just would not do that.

132
00:10:22,651 --> 00:10:24,692
[SPEAKER_22]: They would not do that in Lexington.

133
00:10:25,212 --> 00:10:27,573
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's not have that in Medford.

134
00:10:28,853 --> 00:10:30,934
[SPEAKER_22]: It's not about durability.

135
00:10:31,474 --> 00:10:33,255
[SPEAKER_22]: It's about aesthetics.

136
00:10:35,696 --> 00:10:37,897
[SPEAKER_22]: I've lived in that neighborhood all my life.

137
00:10:38,217 --> 00:10:43,499
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't wanna walk down the street and see something that looks cheap.

138
00:10:44,884 --> 00:10:46,325
[SPEAKER_22]: I have a beautiful home.

139
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:54,711
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't want my property values to go down because I have concrete in front of it.

140
00:10:57,693 --> 00:10:58,974
[SPEAKER_22]: I love this neighborhood.

141
00:10:59,274 --> 00:11:00,255
[SPEAKER_22]: I love Medford.

142
00:11:01,215 --> 00:11:05,238
[SPEAKER_22]: I very much appreciate the city repaving my street.

143
00:11:06,259 --> 00:11:13,884
[SPEAKER_22]: I appreciate the council taking up this issue here tonight, but I have to insist

144
00:11:14,735 --> 00:11:21,660
[SPEAKER_22]: Please stop this project until we can find out if we can find some granite.

145
00:11:22,981 --> 00:11:24,823
[SPEAKER_22]: That was in the original bid.

146
00:11:26,404 --> 00:11:29,827
[SPEAKER_22]: Find out why they made the switch.

147
00:11:32,849 --> 00:11:44,038
[SPEAKER_22]: Please try to find in your budget if we can purchase new granite, dig up this concrete, get rid of it,

148
00:11:44,926 --> 00:11:48,328
[SPEAKER_22]: put in granite, which is appropriate for this neighborhood.

149
00:11:49,989 --> 00:11:51,550
[SPEAKER_22]: You did it for the library.

150
00:11:53,191 --> 00:11:54,472
[SPEAKER_22]: Why can't we do it here?

151
00:11:55,993 --> 00:11:56,954
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you for your time.

152
00:11:57,794 --> 00:11:58,235
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, sir.

153
00:12:00,176 --> 00:12:01,577
[SPEAKER_15]: Chair recognizes Chancellor Caraviello.

154
00:12:04,499 --> 00:12:08,061
[SPEAKER_15]: Chair recognizes Sharon Kennedy on Zoom.

155
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:11,863
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

156
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,624
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you hear me now?

157
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,821
[SPEAKER_15]: Resident storyteller sharing.

158
00:12:17,341 --> 00:12:19,582
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm going to only tell a very true story.

159
00:12:19,622 --> 00:12:20,502
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you hear me okay.

160
00:12:21,242 --> 00:12:21,462
[SPEAKER_15]: You can.

161
00:12:21,982 --> 00:12:22,322
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, good.

162
00:12:23,183 --> 00:12:31,285
[SPEAKER_00]: So I live on Brooke Street, and I can tell you that the park that this very ugly concrete is now beginning to surround.

163
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,421
[SPEAKER_00]: is used by so many people.

164
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:40,504
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's people up and down Woburn and Winthrop Street and coming up from High Street.

165
00:12:40,944 --> 00:12:46,967
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the most popular place in the whole world to do dog walking, whether you live in that neighborhood or not.

166
00:12:47,527 --> 00:12:50,948
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's incredible numbers of children who go sledding in the winter.

167
00:12:50,968 --> 00:12:53,189
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've had musical events there.

168
00:12:53,209 --> 00:12:55,710
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've even had plays there a couple of times.

169
00:12:56,231 --> 00:12:57,711
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all walk there.

170
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:01,213
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is like a neighborhood treasure, this park.

171
00:13:01,793 --> 00:13:09,896
[SPEAKER_00]: This park has an incredible stone tower that you'd be risking your life if you wanted to climb to the top of it.

172
00:13:10,317 --> 00:13:12,137
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a beautiful stone tower.

173
00:13:12,637 --> 00:13:14,258
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is stone around it.

174
00:13:14,658 --> 00:13:20,941
[SPEAKER_00]: Two whole huge sections have three to five foot beautiful stone walls.

175
00:13:21,381 --> 00:13:26,003
[SPEAKER_00]: This part didn't have anything like that, but we definitely need something.

176
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:30,721
[SPEAKER_00]: that fits in with everything else that looks right with the houses.

177
00:13:30,781 --> 00:13:33,883
[SPEAKER_00]: The houses are from 1900, most of them.

178
00:13:33,923 --> 00:13:35,424
[SPEAKER_00]: This is definitely historic.

179
00:13:35,764 --> 00:13:44,468
[SPEAKER_00]: We all love it so much and none of us want to hold our noses while we go by this part of it that just doesn't look right at all.

180
00:13:44,548 --> 00:13:53,253
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that you all sound as if you already understand that this needs granite or it needs some beautiful stone.

181
00:13:53,683 --> 00:14:00,668
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't need concrete, the concrete won't last anyway, but it's completely out of character with the neighborhood.

182
00:14:01,169 --> 00:14:03,010
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for letting me speak.

183
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,291
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Sharon.

184
00:14:05,632 --> 00:14:06,113
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President.

185
00:14:06,373 --> 00:14:07,674
[SPEAKER_13]: Chair recognizes Councilor Caraviello.

186
00:14:09,175 --> 00:14:12,618
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, again, there's still a lot of work to do there.

187
00:14:12,638 --> 00:14:15,440
[SPEAKER_13]: The sidewalks have to be put down all over the place.

188
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:19,123
[SPEAKER_13]: And so again, I don't think the work can't continue.

189
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:30,423
[SPEAKER_13]: They can pave some of, they can pave the Austin Street, I mean, excuse me, the Brooks part of, Brooks Street section of Austin, of Vernon Street, plenty of things there.

190
00:14:30,884 --> 00:14:43,586
[SPEAKER_13]: And they say, there's other work to do until they get an answer, but I would make a motion that the Mystic Street side of Vernon Street not be paved until a decision is made on the granite, putting granite cribs in there.

191
00:14:43,927 --> 00:14:45,507
[SPEAKER_13]: So the motion from Mystic to Austin?

192
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:51,255
[SPEAKER_13]: from mystic yes on the mystic strike the mystic street side of Vernon Street.

193
00:14:53,719 --> 00:14:56,082
[SPEAKER_17]: Someone that has their hand up.

194
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:58,065
[SPEAKER_17]: Who has their hand up?

195
00:14:58,145 --> 00:14:58,806
[SPEAKER_17]: Christopher Leary.

196
00:14:58,846 --> 00:15:00,489
[SPEAKER_15]: Chair recognizes Christopher Leary on Zoom.

197
00:15:04,973 --> 00:15:05,353
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, good.

198
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:07,514
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for having this meeting.

199
00:15:08,055 --> 00:15:11,737
[SPEAKER_14]: My neighbors were instrumental in getting it set up.

200
00:15:11,857 --> 00:15:13,218
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate that effort.

201
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:25,026
[SPEAKER_14]: The councils that have spoken have said everything that I could say, and I'm just here to reiterate the correctness of doing this and getting granted in there.

202
00:15:25,847 --> 00:15:26,968
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we can be patient.

203
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:34,610
[SPEAKER_14]: and be safe at the same time and get the proper material at the right place.

204
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:35,391
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you very much.

205
00:15:36,851 --> 00:15:40,352
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Leary, if I may, can I just ask that you leave your address for the record with the clerk, please?

206
00:15:41,193 --> 00:15:41,853
[SPEAKER_14]: I sure will.

207
00:15:43,293 --> 00:15:43,653
[SPEAKER_14]: Glad to.

208
00:15:44,594 --> 00:15:44,834
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

209
00:15:47,015 --> 00:15:48,815
[SPEAKER_15]: He didn't give his address, I'm sure.

210
00:15:48,935 --> 00:15:49,996
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I'm 40 Vernon Street.

211
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:50,876
[SPEAKER_14]: 40 Vernon.

212

[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, 40 Vernon.

[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President.

[SPEAKER_15]: Chair recognizes Councilor Bears.

215
00:15:58,642 --> 00:15:59,442
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

216
00:15:59,962 --> 00:16:06,145
[SPEAKER_20]: I haven't spoken yet because my fellow councilors said everything that needed to be said, but I just want to add that I'm fully in support of this.

217
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:06,585
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

218
00:16:09,206 --> 00:16:10,427
[SPEAKER_15]: Chair recognizes Councilor Caraviello.

219
00:16:10,607 --> 00:16:12,648
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm good, Mr- You're good?

220
00:16:12,688 --> 00:16:13,188
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm good.

221
00:16:13,748 --> 00:16:17,350
[SPEAKER_15]: I think Chair and Kennedy gave a good explanation of what goes on at that park.

222
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,551
[SPEAKER_15]: Not only kids go sledding up there, right?

223
00:16:19,831 --> 00:16:23,733
[SPEAKER_15]: Might be guilty of sledding up there in the last snowstorm as well with my children.

224
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:38,724
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion by Council car below as amended by Councilor morale asking how often they switch out design specifications in the contract further amended by Council Mac marks asking for the job specifications versus the final product.

225
00:16:39,664 --> 00:16:49,408
[SPEAKER_15]: And whether or not this grant will be temporary this concrete will be temporary until granted is installed and what's the difference in price regarding the approved work order versus the current construction materials.

226
00:16:50,851 --> 00:17:06,000
[SPEAKER_15]: And we have a motion by Councilor Caraviello to ask that the construction stop until these questions be answered in granite curbing be acquired and installed, not to start to start but on the domestic street at the street, and Vernon not be paid.

227
00:17:09,508 --> 00:17:15,032
[SPEAKER_13]: until the concrete is removed as our decision is made.

228
00:17:15,512 --> 00:17:18,775
[SPEAKER_13]: There's plenty of work that needs to be done on the sidewalks and other things that need to be done.

229
00:17:18,835 --> 00:17:21,497
[SPEAKER_15]: So you're asking the reservicing aspects of the project.

230
00:17:21,537 --> 00:17:22,818
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, just the reservicing aspects.

231
00:17:22,878 --> 00:17:25,860
[SPEAKER_15]: Once we service, you're not going to be able to take those curbs out.

232
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:38,372
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, it's important to note too, for the edification of the viewing audience that the council's vote tonight is a recommendation to the city administration.

233
00:17:39,133 --> 00:17:41,715
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't have the authority to stop a project in the community.

234
00:17:42,115 --> 00:17:46,398
[SPEAKER_17]: However, the city administration does, and this is a recommendation to the city administration.

235
00:17:47,218 --> 00:17:47,858
[SPEAKER_15]: Well put councilor.

236
00:17:51,281 --> 00:17:54,943
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, the chair recognizes John Anderson on zoom.

237
00:17:58,834 --> 00:17:59,714
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you very much.

238
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:01,995
[SPEAKER_21]: And can you hear me?

239
00:18:02,795 --> 00:18:03,695
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, John, sounds great.

240
00:18:03,775 --> 00:18:04,215
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, great.

241
00:18:05,055 --> 00:18:07,235
[SPEAKER_21]: This is John Anderson, 102 Brooks Street.

242
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:13,997
[SPEAKER_21]: And I want to thank my neighbors for bringing this to your attention.

243
00:18:14,277 --> 00:18:15,957
[SPEAKER_21]: And of course, I share their sentiments.

244
00:18:17,217 --> 00:18:18,737
[SPEAKER_21]: I won't repeat all their arguments.

245
00:18:18,817 --> 00:18:20,158
[SPEAKER_21]: I know your time is valuable.

246
00:18:20,898 --> 00:18:26,679
[SPEAKER_21]: Just one other thing that we might want to think about is what's the process for getting

247
00:18:28,564 --> 00:18:31,485
[SPEAKER_21]: neighbor involvement in projects like this.

248
00:18:32,685 --> 00:18:39,046
[SPEAKER_21]: I can think of some other projects that have gone on in the city where, you know, if I lived there, I'd be very upset.

249
00:18:39,627 --> 00:18:43,407
[SPEAKER_21]: And I don't know if there's any system change that could be made.

250
00:18:43,808 --> 00:18:54,250
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, I don't want to make projects go on forever, make approval processes too cumbersome, but it seems like if

251
00:18:55,365 --> 00:18:59,187
[SPEAKER_21]: Neighbors had been given the chance to provide a little input on this.

252
00:18:59,687 --> 00:19:01,348
[SPEAKER_21]: This wouldn't have gotten where we are now.

253
00:19:01,888 --> 00:19:02,868
[SPEAKER_21]: That's all I have to say.

254
00:19:02,928 --> 00:19:03,669
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you very much.

255
00:19:03,689 --> 00:19:04,969
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, John.

256
00:19:05,189 --> 00:19:05,790
[SPEAKER_15]: Appreciate it.

00:20:32,512 --> 00:20:33,412
[SPEAKER_13]: 5-2-9 was also tabled.

297
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:35,034
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's it.

298
00:20:35,054 --> 00:20:37,435
[SPEAKER_13]: So, on the motion by Councilor Bears, the table.

299
00:20:46,314 --> 00:20:48,115
[SPEAKER_13]: seconded by second.

300
00:20:48,435 --> 00:20:49,496
[SPEAKER_13]: Seconded by Council Marks.

301
00:20:49,536 --> 00:20:50,216
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

302
00:20:50,436 --> 00:20:51,016
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

303
00:20:51,097 --> 00:20:51,497
[SPEAKER_13]: Opposed?

304
00:20:51,877 --> 00:20:52,617
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

305
00:20:52,637 --> 00:21:01,702
[SPEAKER_13]: 2-1-5-5-3 offered by Vice President Knight, be it resolved that the administration reinstate Michael Durham post haste.

306
00:21:02,242 --> 00:21:08,566
[SPEAKER_13]: A, Council Marks offered an amendment requesting an update on what's going on with the original allegations.

307
00:21:08,686 --> 00:21:14,509
[SPEAKER_13]: Further requested that Mr. Durham be reinstated and further called for a special meeting of the City Council for the purpose of

308
00:21:15,069 --> 00:21:26,538
[SPEAKER_13]: reviewing staffing in the Office of Veterans Services with the city solicitor, a representative of the administration, and Mrs. Darlene White from the Office of Veterans Services to attend.

309
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:28,240
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice President Knight.

310
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,901
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

311
00:21:30,121 --> 00:21:31,742
[SPEAKER_15]: This was a topic at last week's meeting.

312
00:21:32,223 --> 00:21:33,804
[SPEAKER_15]: We certainly discussed it at length.

313
00:21:35,822 --> 00:21:43,487
[SPEAKER_15]: resulting in this Council calling for a special emergency meeting on Saturday to discuss the staffing levels in our veteran service office and what's going on down there.

314
00:21:44,167 --> 00:21:48,189
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we're all well aware of the circumstances and the situation that gave rise to this resolution.

315
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:51,451
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think we need to recreate history or beat a dead horse, Mr. President.

316
00:21:51,491 --> 00:21:53,132
[SPEAKER_15]: What we need to do is get Mike Durham back to work.

317
00:21:53,713 --> 00:21:56,054
[SPEAKER_15]: So with that being said, I offer this resolution this evening.

318
00:21:56,074 --> 00:22:00,317
[SPEAKER_15]: I ask my Council colleagues to support it, to reinstate Mike Durham to the position of veteran service officer.

319
00:22:01,017 --> 00:22:01,397
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

320
00:22:02,418 --> 00:22:04,940
[SPEAKER_15]: That's my Council colleagues to support the measure and I move for approval.

321
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:05,500
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

322
00:22:06,276 --> 00:22:06,657
[SPEAKER_15]: Questions?

323
00:22:08,338 --> 00:22:10,059
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, I'm sorry to speak.

324
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,641
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening, name and address of the record, please.

325
00:22:14,062 --> 00:22:17,505
[SPEAKER_11]: You're good.

326
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:25,971
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, Edward Lundy here in 64 Forest Street, United States Navy veteran.

327
00:22:27,592 --> 00:22:28,753
[SPEAKER_11]: Yesterday was Monday.

328
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:32,343
[SPEAKER_11]: I went into the veteran's office at 10 a.m.

329
00:22:32,483 --> 00:22:36,507
[SPEAKER_11]: to hopefully greet the new veteran's officer of replacement.

330
00:22:37,529 --> 00:22:38,249
[SPEAKER_11]: He was not there.

331
00:22:38,269 --> 00:22:41,212
[SPEAKER_11]: I was told he'd be, he was at the mayor's office.

332
00:22:42,193 --> 00:22:46,318
[SPEAKER_11]: So I waited around for a little bit, a while.

333
00:22:46,338 --> 00:22:47,519
[SPEAKER_11]: I did an errand.

334
00:22:47,879 --> 00:22:49,861
[SPEAKER_11]: I came back at approximately 11.15.

335
00:22:52,352 --> 00:22:56,175
[SPEAKER_11]: I was told he was gone home for the day, off to Wilmington.

336
00:22:56,995 --> 00:23:01,418
[SPEAKER_11]: Prior to that, before I left, I left my name and my number.

337
00:23:01,899 --> 00:23:05,561
[SPEAKER_11]: And I said, I have some questions, if you could give me a call.

338
00:23:06,782 --> 00:23:09,164
[SPEAKER_11]: Here it is, Tuesday, no call.

339
00:23:10,905 --> 00:23:13,607
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if you guys are aware of this.

340
00:23:14,367 --> 00:23:19,331
[SPEAKER_11]: Adam Knight brought this up at Saturday's meeting, I believe, with regional offices.

341
00:23:20,259 --> 00:23:33,404
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a Massachusetts general law stating that the size of the city that has 58,000 people, Massachusetts general law requires you to have at least one veterans officer in the building.

342
00:23:35,065 --> 00:23:40,587
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so we don't have any right now.

343
00:23:41,108 --> 00:23:43,729
[SPEAKER_11]: She sent an email out, I don't know if you guys got it.

344
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:52,966
[SPEAKER_11]: I just got text about 15 minutes before the meeting that she requested all veterans go to Wilmington.

345
00:23:52,986 --> 00:23:59,171
[SPEAKER_11]: So what's going on?

346
00:23:59,491 --> 00:24:05,055
[SPEAKER_11]: Hopefully tomorrow I'll be able to see, oh, he said Friday, he'll be back Friday.

347
00:24:05,075 --> 00:24:11,020
[SPEAKER_11]: Hopefully when I come back Friday, he'll be in the office to attend to business.

348
00:24:14,326 --> 00:24:14,786
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

349
00:24:14,806 --> 00:24:18,229
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

350
00:24:24,073 --> 00:24:25,073
[SPEAKER_16]: Betsy Lister.

351
00:24:26,134 --> 00:24:27,935
[SPEAKER_07]: Betsy Lister, 12 Ross St.

352
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:33,879
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for having this meeting, all of you.

353
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:40,404
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm distressed at what I just heard from Ed Linehan.

354
00:24:41,264 --> 00:24:42,785
[SPEAKER_07]: This is just an outrage.

355
00:24:44,173 --> 00:24:51,900
[SPEAKER_07]: And is there a representative from the mayor's office here this evening?

356
00:24:52,441 --> 00:24:54,743
[SPEAKER_13]: I do not see one on the call.

357
00:24:55,304 --> 00:24:56,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

358
00:24:59,227 --> 00:25:02,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Residents are extremely upset.

359
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,053
[SPEAKER_07]: We feel that

360
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:32,361
[SPEAKER_07]: all of our efforts, all of our words, all of our distress, the infrastructure is crumbling, the city's falling apart, and it appears that the person who is in charge of the city and oversees all has a different agenda, which doesn't involve the rest of the residents.

361
00:25:34,222 --> 00:25:35,283
[SPEAKER_07]: I implore you,

362
00:25:36,755 --> 00:25:43,117
[SPEAKER_07]: to please reinstate Michael Durham to his rightful office as so deserved.

363
00:25:43,157 --> 00:25:44,758
[SPEAKER_07]: He passed the psych exam.

364
00:25:44,778 --> 00:25:46,419
[SPEAKER_07]: There's nothing wrong with that man.

365
00:25:47,019 --> 00:25:50,620
[SPEAKER_07]: What's wrong is what's being done to him.

366
00:25:51,581 --> 00:26:00,124
[SPEAKER_07]: So I ask that you consider him favorably for a reinstatement and that we address this properly.

367
00:26:00,404 --> 00:26:00,864
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

368
00:26:00,884 --> 00:26:02,465
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

369
00:26:06,127 --> 00:26:14,493
[SPEAKER_13]: I came in on Monday, and I did have an opportunity to meet Mr. Chamalia and introduce myself and told him I'd be here to assist.

370
00:26:15,093 --> 00:26:19,436
[SPEAKER_13]: And left, and I didn't know how long, I don't know how long he was in the building.

371
00:26:20,517 --> 00:26:28,443
[SPEAKER_13]: We did have an emergency situation this morning, which a family reached out to me because City Hall hadn't been open.

372
00:26:29,346 --> 00:26:34,729
[SPEAKER_13]: And I did reach out to Mr. Somalia with the people's number to help them out.

373
00:26:37,551 --> 00:26:40,653
[SPEAKER_13]: And when I reached out, reached back up to the family, he had helped them.

374
00:26:41,553 --> 00:26:46,056
[SPEAKER_13]: But it doesn't constitute us not having somebody in the building.

375
00:26:47,417 --> 00:26:50,639
[SPEAKER_13]: So this woman, this family could have came in here, we didn't have to do this on the phone.

376
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,341
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a very traumatic thing.

377
00:26:54,221 --> 00:26:57,103
[SPEAKER_13]: And let's say, though I do appreciate him helping out,

378
00:26:57,918 --> 00:27:05,499
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that was something that should have been done in person because of the seriousness of the nature of what happened to the family.

379
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:05,659
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

380
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:09,540
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President.

381
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:11,420
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Belco.

382
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,401
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

383
00:27:14,501 --> 00:27:19,842
[SPEAKER_05]: So we had a meeting on Saturday and no one showed up from the mayor's office to address the issues.

384
00:27:21,262 --> 00:27:25,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we are once again, Tuesday night, a full week later,

385
00:27:27,085 --> 00:27:31,148
[SPEAKER_05]: still no one at the podium from the administration to address the issue.

386
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:34,711
[SPEAKER_05]: An email was sent.

387
00:27:36,813 --> 00:27:40,976
[SPEAKER_05]: We still have no clarification on what kind of coverage is being offered down in the veteran's office.

388
00:27:42,757 --> 00:27:43,838
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone came from Wilmington.

389
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,602
[SPEAKER_05]: That helps, I guess, in some sort of way.

390
00:27:49,462 --> 00:27:54,086
[SPEAKER_05]: But we have no idea how many days a week, how many hours a day,

391
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,441
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, issues come up that might not be timely.

392
00:27:58,461 --> 00:28:00,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone might be here in the morning if there's no coverage.

393
00:28:01,142 --> 00:28:04,983
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's no, we have no idea when that office is being covered.

394
00:28:06,803 --> 00:28:11,425
[SPEAKER_05]: I came in on Friday, the office was in darkness, not even a note on the door.

395
00:28:11,445 --> 00:28:20,147
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I know Michael Durham dealt with some pretty heavy issues down there when veterans came in and they had questions or they needed help.

396
00:28:23,208 --> 00:28:24,789
[SPEAKER_05]: This issue needs to be addressed.

397
00:28:26,843 --> 00:28:27,943
[SPEAKER_05]: And it needs to be addressed now.

398
00:28:28,003 --> 00:28:32,545
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel that by doing this here, the administration is kicking a can down the road.

399
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:34,045
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no coverage for that office.

400
00:28:34,085 --> 00:28:35,546
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no coverage for the veterans.

401
00:28:38,106 --> 00:28:39,187
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no plan here.

402
00:28:39,287 --> 00:28:40,127
[SPEAKER_05]: This is not a plan.

403
00:28:42,748 --> 00:28:44,648
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no one here to answer any questions tonight.

404
00:28:45,309 --> 00:28:49,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Once again, this needs to be addressed.

405
00:28:51,633 --> 00:28:58,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you had any conversations with the mayor that can shed any light on the type of coverage you're going to be getting?

406
00:28:59,175 --> 00:29:03,977
[SPEAKER_13]: I talked to the chief of staff on Monday, along when I met the gentleman who was working here.

407
00:29:05,057 --> 00:29:07,158
[SPEAKER_13]: I expressed my concerns to her.

408
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:17,421
[SPEAKER_13]: And I also sent her and the mayor an email with several questions that I thought should be answered.

409
00:29:19,241 --> 00:29:26,963
[SPEAKER_13]: A couple of them were somewhat answered, but some of the ones I asked, I didn't see answered yet.

410
00:29:27,083 --> 00:29:27,643
[SPEAKER_05]: So here we are.

411
00:29:27,663 --> 00:29:29,324
[SPEAKER_05]: There's still no long-term solution.

412
00:29:30,424 --> 00:29:32,125
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know when Michael's coming back.

413
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:35,586
[SPEAKER_05]: He went on his own to get an evaluation.

414
00:29:36,526 --> 00:29:40,867
[SPEAKER_05]: That wasn't good enough for the administration, but they're still not telling him when he needs to get an evaluation.

415
00:29:43,962 --> 00:29:46,772
[SPEAKER_05]: They're doing just, the city is doing such a disservice.

416
00:29:46,833 --> 00:29:50,425
[SPEAKER_05]: I should say the administration is doing such a disservice to the veterans of this community.

417
00:29:51,596 --> 00:29:53,076
[SPEAKER_05]: It's absolutely unacceptable.

418
00:29:53,436 --> 00:30:06,038
[SPEAKER_15]: One information, Vice President Knight, on that point, not only are they doing a disservice to the veterans in this community, they're doing a disservice to Mike Durham, the human being, a husband, a father, someone who served this country.

419
00:30:06,298 --> 00:30:13,620
[SPEAKER_15]: They're doing a disservice to him too, leaving him hanging out there like this, using him as a political pawn because they don't like the pressure he's putting on him.

420
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,740
[SPEAKER_15]: Enough's enough with this, Mr. President.

421
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:16,880
[SPEAKER_15]: It's time he gets back to work.

422
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:18,841
[SPEAKER_15]: They're playing with a man's life.

423
00:30:20,041 --> 00:30:20,321
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

424
00:30:22,056 --> 00:30:25,518
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, and I thank Councilor Knight for his words, but I agree 100%.

425
00:30:25,578 --> 00:30:27,158
[SPEAKER_05]: This needs to be dealt with.

426
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:29,400
[SPEAKER_05]: The administration is not dealing with the issue.

427
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,860
[SPEAKER_05]: There is no plan to move forward.

428
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,721
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no plans for coverage in that office.

429
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:39,585
[SPEAKER_05]: I support the resolution, but the administration needs to get on the ball and get a solution to this issue.

430
00:30:39,625 --> 00:30:41,285
[SPEAKER_05]: This is absolutely unacceptable.

431
00:30:42,346 --> 00:30:45,888
[SPEAKER_05]: The residents of this city, the veterans of this city deserve more than they're getting.

432
00:30:47,288 --> 00:30:47,608
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

433
00:30:53,496 --> 00:30:54,557
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address of the record, please.

434
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:00,762
[SPEAKER_07]: For these comments, this just hit me.

435
00:31:02,584 --> 00:31:10,070
[SPEAKER_07]: What happens when a veteran in crisis comes here for help and is told, oh, you know what?

436
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:12,092
[SPEAKER_07]: You gotta go 20 minutes up the road.

437
00:31:12,532 --> 00:31:13,693
[SPEAKER_13]: Can I make, can I say something?

438
00:31:16,435 --> 00:31:18,077
[SPEAKER_13]: No one said to go to Wilmington.

439
00:31:19,498 --> 00:31:20,759
[SPEAKER_13]: It says if you have,

440
00:31:21,502 --> 00:31:25,465
[SPEAKER_13]: a problem, call Wilmington or email, but they didn't say to drive there.

441
00:31:25,765 --> 00:31:26,285
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

442
00:31:26,466 --> 00:31:30,208
[SPEAKER_07]: So call Wilmington, maybe the guy's there, maybe he isn't.

443
00:31:30,949 --> 00:31:31,549
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we know?

444
00:31:31,689 --> 00:31:32,790
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't know where he is.

445
00:31:33,571 --> 00:31:44,839
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just saying, as the wife of a 100% service-related disabled veteran who has dealt with these crises,

446
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:52,427
[SPEAKER_07]: I need help, he needs help, and we don't need it on a phone call 20 minutes up the road.

447
00:31:53,207 --> 00:31:54,527
[SPEAKER_07]: I've dealt with Michael Durham.

448
00:31:54,808 --> 00:32:08,012
[SPEAKER_07]: I find him to be quite professional, to be a gentle giant, and his expertise in knowing what to do and who to contact and how to react and calm a veteran and make him feel at ease.

449
00:32:08,392 --> 00:32:15,874
[SPEAKER_07]: The rapport, the whole thing, you're missing the boat, and this administration is laughing at us.

450
00:32:17,697 --> 00:32:19,579
[SPEAKER_07]: and using him as a political pawn.

451
00:32:19,719 --> 00:32:30,087
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just a shamble and shame that nobody is here to represent the administration while he hangs out on a clothesline in the breeze.

452
00:32:30,187 --> 00:32:31,709
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just not right.

453
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:32,429
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

454
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:34,951
[SPEAKER_07]: And the residents are really fed up.

455
00:32:35,472 --> 00:32:35,912
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

456
00:32:35,932 --> 00:32:42,578
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

457
00:32:45,504 --> 00:32:45,944
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President.

458
00:32:46,665 --> 00:32:47,225
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Lachs.

459
00:32:48,126 --> 00:32:49,087
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

460
00:32:49,527 --> 00:33:02,636
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'll be brief because this resolution that's on tonight was a result of the resolution that was offered by this council unanimously last Tuesday that came under suspension.

461
00:33:03,397 --> 00:33:13,864
[SPEAKER_17]: And the reason why we could not give it a formal vote, Mr. President, is the fact that it appeared on the agenda under suspension and the open meeting rules require that the

462
00:33:14,583 --> 00:33:16,825
[SPEAKER_17]: item that we vote on appear on the agenda.

463
00:33:17,205 --> 00:33:23,570
[SPEAKER_17]: So we requested that it appear on tonight's agenda agenda so we could take a formal vote for reinstatement.

464
00:33:24,291 --> 00:33:27,093
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, it's a little troubling to me, Mr. President.

465
00:33:27,153 --> 00:33:36,240
[SPEAKER_17]: It's now 12 days since Mike Durham, a veterans officer, was walked out of City Hall.

466
00:33:37,341 --> 00:33:38,082
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, and

467
00:33:39,773 --> 00:33:51,419
[SPEAKER_17]: According to the letter that was written by the administration, there is no corrective action being taken against Mike Durham.

468
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,040
[SPEAKER_17]: That was part of the letter.

469
00:33:54,541 --> 00:33:57,883
[SPEAKER_17]: So the city is not putting Mike Durham on corrective action.

470
00:33:58,463 --> 00:34:05,747
[SPEAKER_17]: What they did state to Mike Durham is that they will handpick a physician

471
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:15,453
[SPEAKER_17]: a psychiatrist that Mike needs to go to to submit to a psychological exam.

472
00:34:17,294 --> 00:34:19,395
[SPEAKER_17]: That was 12 days ago.

473
00:34:21,136 --> 00:34:34,501
[SPEAKER_17]: If anyone felt that there was need for Mike Durham to submit to a psychological exam, that should have been done immediately, immediately.

474
00:34:36,377 --> 00:34:41,218
[SPEAKER_17]: The urgency of a psychological exam should take place immediately.

475
00:34:42,378 --> 00:34:43,438
[SPEAKER_17]: It's 12 days now.

476
00:34:44,379 --> 00:34:48,600
[SPEAKER_17]: Mike Durham went on his own to the VA hospital in Bedford.

477
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:56,541
[SPEAKER_17]: He met with a nurse for 45 minutes and they conducted an evaluation.

478
00:34:56,821 --> 00:35:05,203
[SPEAKER_17]: He met with a board registered psychiatrist for 45 minutes that came out with a multi-page document

479
00:35:06,897 --> 00:35:14,739
[SPEAKER_17]: stating that more or less, and I'm not gonna quote, because I don't have the report in front of me, that Mike was fit to go back to work.

480
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,501
[SPEAKER_17]: No underlying issues, he was fit to come back to work.

481
00:35:21,201 --> 00:35:33,304
[SPEAKER_17]: Here we are 12 days later, that report was sent to the administration, and the administration still sticks by, they wanna have their own person evaluate Mike.

482
00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:57,996
[SPEAKER_17]: To me, Mr. President, I think we're getting into a very slippery slope when you have someone that's a whistleblower, that brought up potential fraud, potential wage theft that's going on in this community, and brought it to his superiors, which he should have done.

483
00:35:59,858 --> 00:36:05,101
[SPEAKER_17]: And then to have this type of action taken against this employee

484
00:36:07,264 --> 00:36:11,945
[SPEAKER_17]: to me, is not acceptable, Mr. President.

485
00:36:14,106 --> 00:36:15,966
[SPEAKER_17]: It reeks of retaliation.

486
00:36:17,746 --> 00:36:28,329
[SPEAKER_17]: Leaving someone out of work for almost two weeks now, not knowing when he's gonna get this call to go see this particular doctor is unacceptable.

487
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:35,524
[SPEAKER_17]: In particular, it's unacceptable when there's no corrective action against this particular employee.

488
00:36:36,404 --> 00:36:40,667
[SPEAKER_17]: The employee has unblemished record in this community.

489
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:43,789
[SPEAKER_17]: Check out his personnel file.

490
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:47,951
[SPEAKER_17]: It speaks volumes when you look at it.

491
00:36:48,792 --> 00:36:55,696
[SPEAKER_17]: A gentleman that's gone over and above the call of duty, not just in the city, but the call of duty to this nation.

492
00:36:59,144 --> 00:37:11,494
[SPEAKER_17]: So, Mr. President, I am really troubled that this is going on for so long, that we can't get back to the business at hand of running and operating our community.

493
00:37:11,974 --> 00:37:16,137
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're focusing on an issue, in my opinion, that we shouldn't be focusing on.

494
00:37:16,437 --> 00:37:19,780
[SPEAKER_17]: We should be looking at the wage theft and potential fraud.

495
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,541
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what we should be looking at.

496
00:37:24,964 --> 00:37:26,225
[SPEAKER_17]: As I stated last week,

497
00:37:27,756 --> 00:37:32,357
[SPEAKER_17]: In the federal government, a whistleblower gets congratulated.

498
00:37:33,357 --> 00:37:36,018
[SPEAKER_17]: They get compensated in certain circumstances.

499
00:37:36,998 --> 00:37:43,160
[SPEAKER_17]: In the city of Method, they ask you to take a psychological exam and they kick you out of work.

500
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,680
[SPEAKER_17]: And they tell you, you can't go in a municipal building.

501
00:37:49,841 --> 00:37:53,102
[SPEAKER_17]: What does he say when he has to go have a parent-teacher meeting?

502
00:37:55,316 --> 00:37:57,517
[SPEAKER_17]: You can't talk to other city employees.

503
00:37:58,998 --> 00:38:02,460
[SPEAKER_17]: That sounds like a corrective action to me, Mr. President.

504
00:38:05,101 --> 00:38:07,182
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, I'm very disturbed about this.

505
00:38:07,843 --> 00:38:23,671
[SPEAKER_17]: I would hope the city administration that talks about transparency all the time will be transparent and come up and discuss the issue with the other legislative body, the elected body in this community,

506
00:38:25,731 --> 00:38:29,152
[SPEAKER_17]: and put this behind us, and that is yet to happen.

507
00:38:31,832 --> 00:38:47,816
[SPEAKER_17]: So my vote tonight, Mr. President, will be the vote I took last week to respectfully ask the mayor, who's the only one that can reinstate Mike Durham in this community, to respectfully ask the mayor to reinstate Mike Durham.

508
00:38:49,016 --> 00:38:55,198
[SPEAKER_17]: And let's not continue to play out personnel matters, as the mayor always refers to it,

509
00:38:56,311 --> 00:38:58,112
[SPEAKER_17]: I can't discuss it, personnel matter.

510
00:38:58,312 --> 00:38:59,953
[SPEAKER_17]: Can't discuss it, personnel matter.

511
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:00,953
[SPEAKER_17]: Personnel matter.

512
00:39:01,113 --> 00:39:06,736
[SPEAKER_17]: The council can't meet in emergency meeting or executive session, that's a personnel matter.

513
00:39:08,457 --> 00:39:15,200
[SPEAKER_17]: However, these personnel matters are finding their way into social media.

514
00:39:16,481 --> 00:39:17,481
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know how they're getting there.

515
00:39:18,662 --> 00:39:22,504
[SPEAKER_17]: Some even say confidential at the top.

516
00:39:26,584 --> 00:39:37,470
[SPEAKER_17]: The private investigator, Mr. President, that was hired by this administration, hand selected, is not so independent.

517
00:39:38,431 --> 00:39:41,432
[SPEAKER_17]: The private investigator that was hired, Mr. President.

518
00:39:42,553 --> 00:39:43,994
[SPEAKER_17]: And the record should reflect that.

519
00:39:44,354 --> 00:39:46,415
[SPEAKER_17]: And it was stated here before the council.

520
00:39:46,855 --> 00:39:48,216
[SPEAKER_17]: If need be, we can pull the tapes.

521
00:39:49,297 --> 00:39:51,258
[SPEAKER_17]: It was handpicked by the administration.

522
00:39:52,859 --> 00:39:54,400
[SPEAKER_17]: So from now on, Mr. President,

523
00:39:55,563 --> 00:40:06,232
[SPEAKER_17]: If you can handpick the judge you go before or the investigator that's investigating you, that's a society I don't want to live in.

524
00:40:07,173 --> 00:40:11,736
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a report I don't put any trust or confidence or faith in, Mr. President.

525
00:40:12,497 --> 00:40:18,942
[SPEAKER_17]: This council asked, right, if we could hire our own investigator to look into it.

526
00:40:19,242 --> 00:40:23,406
[SPEAKER_17]: It takes it off the mayor's table so it doesn't look like the fix is in.

527
00:40:25,182 --> 00:40:34,892
[SPEAKER_17]: The mayor would not fund that, refused to give us one red nickel, Mr. President, to hire our own investigator.

528
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:36,814
[SPEAKER_17]: We all know it came back.

529
00:40:37,115 --> 00:40:42,681
[SPEAKER_17]: The report came back, and the report found that there was no wrongdoing here at City Hall.

530
00:40:43,956 --> 00:40:50,120
[SPEAKER_17]: I would have had more respect if they said, you know what, we did find a little something and maybe this could improve or that could improve.

531
00:40:50,761 --> 00:40:52,662
[SPEAKER_17]: Nothing at all, Mr. President.

532
00:40:53,223 --> 00:40:56,445
[SPEAKER_17]: And it sends a message to everyone else in this community.

533
00:40:56,885 --> 00:40:59,827
[SPEAKER_17]: If you know something's going wrong, don't stand up.

534
00:41:00,528 --> 00:41:01,749
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't be a whistleblower.

535
00:41:02,589 --> 00:41:06,792
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't put your neck on the line like Mike Durham did because they'll go after you.

536
00:41:07,053 --> 00:41:10,015
[SPEAKER_17]: They'll go after your family and they'll make sure they hurt you.

537
00:41:11,155 --> 00:41:12,336
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's what's happening right now.

538
00:41:12,596 --> 00:41:14,857
[SPEAKER_17]: They're hurting a good man and his family.

539
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:22,121
[SPEAKER_17]: And I want to thank this council for standing up.

540
00:41:22,582 --> 00:41:29,506
[SPEAKER_17]: I also have to go on record, Mr. President, because Saturday, when we asked the administration to appear,

541
00:41:31,223 --> 00:41:40,064
[SPEAKER_17]: The administration supposedly sent an email on the Friday to members of the council stating that they could not attend.

542
00:41:40,445 --> 00:41:45,305
[SPEAKER_17]: No one from the administration was going to come to our planned meeting on Saturday.

543
00:41:47,306 --> 00:41:53,847
[SPEAKER_17]: All I can tell you, Mr. President, is as one member of the council, I did not receive that email.

544
00:41:57,647 --> 00:41:58,128
[SPEAKER_17]: Excuse me.

545
00:41:58,448 --> 00:42:00,628
[SPEAKER_17]: I did not receive that email from the administration.

546
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:06,524
[SPEAKER_17]: I've been using the same email in this community for 26 years.

547
00:42:09,286 --> 00:42:17,133
[SPEAKER_17]: And the administration knows there's members of this council that opted not to use the city email and have been using their own email.

548
00:42:17,613 --> 00:42:18,754
[SPEAKER_17]: And they know how to communicate.

549
00:42:19,154 --> 00:42:20,175
[SPEAKER_17]: I get lots of email.

550
00:42:20,375 --> 00:42:24,819
[SPEAKER_17]: I got two today from the administration on my correct email.

551
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:30,864
[SPEAKER_17]: But Friday, I got it on a different email that I don't use, Mr. President.

552
00:42:32,045 --> 00:42:44,198
[SPEAKER_17]: And it happened to go out that this letter that was sent was now leaked on social media, stating that the council lied on Saturday.

553
00:42:44,719 --> 00:42:54,209
[SPEAKER_17]: The council stated that they weren't notified that the administrations weren't showing up, that the administration wasn't showing up.

554
00:42:56,038 --> 00:42:58,740
[SPEAKER_17]: And indeed, Mr. President, we didn't receive it.

555
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:03,724
[SPEAKER_17]: I can say four members of the seven did not receive the email, Mr. President.

556
00:43:04,044 --> 00:43:05,185
[SPEAKER_17]: That was not a lie.

557
00:43:05,545 --> 00:43:07,046
[SPEAKER_17]: I haven't lied in 26 years.

558
00:43:07,286 --> 00:43:09,728
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not gonna start now on my way out, Mr. President.

559
00:43:09,748 --> 00:43:11,089
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not gonna start now.

560
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:13,371
[SPEAKER_17]: We did not receive that.

561
00:43:13,751 --> 00:43:17,994
[SPEAKER_17]: So to play this out in the media and go back and forth is a complete disgrace.

562
00:43:19,315 --> 00:43:24,379
[SPEAKER_17]: And I would hope that this administration comes to their senses, Mr. President.

563
00:43:25,882 --> 00:43:29,585
[SPEAKER_17]: and resolves this issue before it goes any further.

564
00:43:29,765 --> 00:43:30,666
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

565
00:43:31,406 --> 00:43:32,187
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Dr. Marks.

566
00:43:32,247 --> 00:43:41,554
[SPEAKER_13]: And I did express my displeasure to the chief of staff that a city hall email was out on social media.

567
00:43:43,696 --> 00:43:45,617
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know how it got out there, but somehow,

568
00:43:48,356 --> 00:43:54,438
[SPEAKER_13]: things that should be kept between us and now being put out on social media.

569
00:43:54,538 --> 00:43:58,879
[SPEAKER_13]: I wasn't too happy about that and I did let the chief of staff understand that.

570
00:43:59,779 --> 00:44:03,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, thank you Mr. President, do we ever get an answer as to

571
00:44:06,488 --> 00:44:09,969
[SPEAKER_05]: If Michael's voicemail has been checked or his email has been checked.

572
00:44:10,009 --> 00:44:12,409
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we asked questions about that during the Saturday session.

573
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:16,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Trying to make sure if there's any urgent issues that they get addressed.

574
00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:18,091
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't answer that Constable.

575
00:44:18,171 --> 00:44:21,251
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't, I don't see that in the, in the email that I got today.

576
00:44:21,832 --> 00:44:23,632
[SPEAKER_13]: But let's say, you know, um, I was fortunate.

577
00:44:23,652 --> 00:44:25,913
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a, we did have an emergency situation this morning.

578
00:44:26,393 --> 00:44:27,653
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm glad the person reached out to me.

579
00:44:28,448 --> 00:44:32,610
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think it's something that should have been dealt with in person.

580
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:36,672
[SPEAKER_13]: And I do appreciate Mr. Chimaya handling it very professionally.

581
00:44:36,692 --> 00:44:40,133
[SPEAKER_13]: He's done it today, but the family needed to be talked to in person.

582
00:44:40,634 --> 00:44:43,615
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a very grave situation that happened.

583
00:44:43,655 --> 00:44:46,036
[SPEAKER_13]: It wasn't something that should have been done over the telephone.

584
00:44:46,476 --> 00:44:51,659
[SPEAKER_15]: Has the administration answered the question as to how Mr. Chimaya is getting paid?

585
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:55,040
[SPEAKER_13]: According to the email I have, it does not say how he's getting paid.

586
00:44:58,503 --> 00:45:00,984
[SPEAKER_16]: And Mr. Durham does continue to get paid those, it's my understanding.

587
00:45:01,004 --> 00:45:04,686
[SPEAKER_16]: He's not being disciplined, he's on a paid administrative leave, so he is receiving a salary.

588
00:45:04,706 --> 00:45:05,186
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, thank you.

589
00:45:05,206 --> 00:45:05,647
[SPEAKER_16]: That's correct.

590
00:45:07,988 --> 00:45:13,030
[SPEAKER_13]: So on the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco.

591

00:45:59,195 --> 00:46:03,556
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President, and I want to thank you for co-sponsoring this resolution.

610

[SPEAKER_17]: Dr. Edward Butler has been a staple in this community for four decades.

611
00:46:11,438 --> 00:46:19,200
[SPEAKER_17]: In particular, Mr. President, serving as an internal medicine doctor and infectious disease doctor at Lawrence Memorial Hospital.

612
00:46:20,581 --> 00:46:25,442
[SPEAKER_17]: Dr. Butler served on the Method Board of Health for a number of years, Mr. President.

613
00:46:25,982 --> 00:46:49,028
[SPEAKER_17]: and was always available, according to the brave men and women of our police and fire department, to be available for the departments of police and fire for communicable diseases and exposure, Mr. President, which many in law enforcement and our fire department come in contact with on a daily basis.

614
00:46:50,648 --> 00:46:54,409
[SPEAKER_17]: Dr. Butler was a professor of community health at Tufts University.

615
00:46:55,089 --> 00:47:08,974
[SPEAKER_17]: He also served at many roles at LMH as the Director of Medical Affairs, Chief of Staff, Senior Vice President of Medical Affairs, and Chief Academic Officer of Hallmark Health Systems.

616
00:47:10,195 --> 00:47:15,957
[SPEAKER_17]: He received a number of distinguished awards over the years.

617
00:47:16,097 --> 00:47:22,500
[SPEAKER_17]: In 2012, he won the Ken Kaplan MD Award of the Massachusetts Infectious Disease Society,

618
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:28,063
[SPEAKER_17]: 2001, he won the Middlesex Medical Society Physician of the Year Award.

619
00:47:28,604 --> 00:47:33,607
[SPEAKER_17]: Dr. Buck was named three times to Boston Magazine Best Doctors.

620
00:47:34,548 --> 00:47:52,860
[SPEAKER_17]: He was a recipient of the Hallmark Health Hero Award and was in a number of publications, which I won't mention them at all, but the New England Journal of Medicine and the American Society for Microbiology, to name a few, Mr. President.

621
00:47:53,921 --> 00:48:01,667
[SPEAKER_17]: Here's a gentleman that when you met him, honestly, you would never know he was a physician.

622
00:48:03,148 --> 00:48:05,390
[SPEAKER_17]: He was a down-to-earth person.

623
00:48:06,451 --> 00:48:15,278
[SPEAKER_17]: He was one that cared about his community, cared about his patients, Mr. President, and he will sorely be missed.

624
00:48:16,968 --> 00:48:21,071
[SPEAKER_17]: He had a tremendous office in there that assisted him.

625
00:48:21,471 --> 00:48:25,814
[SPEAKER_17]: He would be the first to tell you that he didn't do this alone for four decades.

626
00:48:26,675 --> 00:48:30,758
[SPEAKER_17]: His team consisted of Maureen Hayes that was with him for 36 years.

627
00:48:32,239 --> 00:48:36,383
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that says a lot when someone stays with you for 36 years, Mr. President.

628
00:48:36,743 --> 00:48:47,733
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it speaks volumes on his character, how he treated his staff, how he treated his patients, and the type of man Dr. Butler is, Mr. President.

629
00:48:48,894 --> 00:48:50,035
[SPEAKER_17]: Nancy Mahoney, 20 years.

630
00:48:52,037 --> 00:48:59,763

631
00:49:01,384 --> 00:49:05,507
[SPEAKER_17]: I know they're having a retirement party for Dr. Butler tomorrow.

632
00:49:05,967 --> 00:49:08,109
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to make sure that we get a resolution.

633
00:49:08,169 --> 00:49:12,712
[SPEAKER_17]: I know, Mr. President, I think you forwarded a resolution to thank Dr. Butler

634
00:49:13,032 --> 00:49:13,953
[SPEAKER_17]: I already have it.

635
00:49:13,973 --> 00:49:14,873
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

636
00:49:15,173 --> 00:49:27,019
[SPEAKER_17]: For all his years and commitment to the residents of this community, he did a great job in protecting us during the past two years of COVID, being an infectious disease doctor.

637
00:49:27,419 --> 00:49:30,341
[SPEAKER_17]: He was the resident expert in this community.

638
00:49:31,101 --> 00:49:36,043
[SPEAKER_17]: And many agencies, businesses look to Dr. Butler for his advice.

639
00:49:36,404 --> 00:49:40,626
[SPEAKER_17]: And that included city departments, as I mentioned earlier, Mr. President.

640
00:49:41,306 --> 00:49:45,908
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, I want to thank him and let him know and his staff that they will be sorely missed.

641
00:49:46,169 --> 00:49:47,089
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

642
00:49:47,569 --> 00:49:47,869
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

643
00:49:47,889 --> 00:49:49,290
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

644
00:49:50,351 --> 00:49:52,932
[SPEAKER_13]: I've gotten to know Dr. Butler both as a friend and a doctor.

645
00:49:54,013 --> 00:49:55,713
[SPEAKER_13]: He's helped me on many occasions.

646
00:49:56,134 --> 00:50:00,296
[SPEAKER_13]: How many doctors give you their home cell phone number until you call me anytime you need something?

647
00:50:01,016 --> 00:50:01,837
[SPEAKER_13]: That's Dr. Butler.

648
00:50:02,517 --> 00:50:06,459
[SPEAKER_13]: I've called him on a Sunday, be in my office at six o'clock in the morning.

649
00:50:06,659 --> 00:50:07,720
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll make sure you get seen.

650
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,061
[SPEAKER_13]: He's that kind of, you know,

651
00:50:11,459 --> 00:50:12,980
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't find those kinds of doctors anymore.

652
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,061
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, now you call the doctor, I'm sick.

653
00:50:15,141 --> 00:50:16,601
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, you know, can you come in like four weeks?

654
00:50:18,882 --> 00:50:21,243
[SPEAKER_13]: Dr. Bartlett say, come in now.

655
00:50:21,283 --> 00:50:21,884
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll wait for you.

656
00:50:21,944 --> 00:50:22,524
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll wait for you.

657
00:50:22,584 --> 00:50:23,324
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll stay for you.

658
00:50:23,905 --> 00:50:31,548
[SPEAKER_13]: He was that, he was that guy that, that old fashioned doctor that we're missing in our whole medical profession in general.

659
00:50:32,509 --> 00:50:34,009
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna be proud tomorrow.

660

[SPEAKER_13]: I'm gonna be presented with a citation with Councilor Marx.

661
00:50:37,511 --> 00:50:39,412
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, again,

662
00:50:40,242 --> 00:50:41,422
[SPEAKER_13]: lost a moral hallmark.

663
00:50:42,363 --> 00:50:45,523
[SPEAKER_13]: The knowledge of doctor Butler is going to be best for.

664
00:50:48,004 --> 00:50:49,784

00:51:30,081 --> 00:51:33,444
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, thank you very much, and I appreciate you co-sponsoring this resolution with me.

670
00:51:34,184 --> 00:51:34,865
[SPEAKER_15]: Paul McGillivray.

671
00:51:35,609 --> 00:51:52,181
[SPEAKER_15]: born and raised on Marion Street in South Medford, son of Harold McGilvery senior, a very, very, very recognized cop that served in the city of Medford on the NBC was injured in the line of duty and actually passed away very recently from the injuries that he sustained on that fateful night.

672
00:51:53,141 --> 00:51:57,604
[SPEAKER_15]: Following in his father's footsteps, Paul became a Metro Police Officer some 25 years ago, Mr. President.

673
00:51:58,124 --> 00:52:05,308
[SPEAKER_15]: And during that 25 years, Paul was so happy to say when I spoke to him the other day with a smile on his face that he had an unblemished record.

674
00:52:05,428 --> 00:52:09,830
[SPEAKER_15]: In 25 years of service as a Metro Police Officer, he had a perfect record, an unblemished record.

675
00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:12,111
[SPEAKER_15]: And for 25 years, he served his community.

676
00:52:12,592 --> 00:52:18,555
[SPEAKER_15]: But a number of years ago, he moved up to the town of Wilmington, where he and his wife, Andrea, began to raise their wonderful family.

677
00:52:19,295 --> 00:52:20,796
[SPEAKER_15]: And Paul had a great opportunity.

678
00:52:21,158 --> 00:52:23,700
[SPEAKER_15]: to transfer departments and to now work in the town that he lives in.

679
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:28,964
[SPEAKER_15]: So born and raised in Medford, he had the opportunity to do 25 years here in the city of Medford, protecting the residents.

680
00:52:29,585 --> 00:52:32,467
[SPEAKER_15]: And now he's gonna have the opportunity to do that up in Wilmington, the town that he lives in.

681
00:52:32,887 --> 00:52:42,855
[SPEAKER_15]: So I wish Paul the best of luck to his health, to his safety, and most importantly, to his happiness, to have the opportunity to be close to his family, to be in his neighborhood and to work in his hometown is something that's great.

682
00:52:43,175 --> 00:52:44,256
[SPEAKER_15]: It's something that we all relish.

683
00:52:44,616 --> 00:52:47,499
[SPEAKER_15]: So I congratulate him and I wish him the best of luck moving forward.

684
00:52:47,819 --> 00:52:50,121
[SPEAKER_15]: He's a great individual, just a great person to be around.

685
00:52:50,481 --> 00:52:51,822
[SPEAKER_15]: A lot of fun, a lot of knowledge.

686
00:52:52,342 --> 00:52:54,544
[SPEAKER_15]: A cop's cop, as they like to say.

687
00:52:55,685 --> 00:52:57,726
[SPEAKER_15]: He gets out of the car, he does his job, he does the work.

688
00:52:58,366 --> 00:53:02,649
[SPEAKER_15]: He's someone that's gonna be sadly missed, and they're gonna have a big pair of boots to fill down there at Medford Police Department.

689
00:53:03,069 --> 00:53:04,490
[SPEAKER_15]: With Paul McGilvray leaving, Mr. President.

690
00:53:04,891 --> 00:53:05,271
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

691
00:53:06,352 --> 00:53:11,935
[SPEAKER_13]: And for myself, you know, Paul has become a good friend over the years to me.

692
00:53:13,016 --> 00:53:16,398
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, you know, he's 25 years of dedicated service as a policeman.

693
00:53:16,719 --> 00:53:17,719
[SPEAKER_13]: He was a policeman's policeman.

694
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:20,881
[SPEAKER_13]: He did his job seriously.

695
00:53:20,901 --> 00:53:23,302
[SPEAKER_13]: He was compassionate and cared about people.

696
00:53:24,142 --> 00:53:25,763
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's the kind of person he is.

697
00:53:27,463 --> 00:53:28,884
[SPEAKER_13]: Our loss is Wilmington's gain.

698
00:53:28,904 --> 00:53:32,826
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to be honest, I'm going to miss my discussions with him.

699
00:53:32,846 --> 00:53:36,487
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I had a problem at my house.

700
00:53:37,087 --> 00:53:41,369
[SPEAKER_13]: I was sick and Paul was the first one to come in and help me with the fire departments.

701
00:53:42,350 --> 00:53:43,230
[SPEAKER_13]: He jokes about it now.

702
00:53:44,635 --> 00:53:56,864
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, he's a good person, and I say it's a shame that we're losing a good quality police officer like that, especially now when our department is down with the amount of retirements.

703
00:53:56,924 --> 00:53:59,966
[SPEAKER_13]: He's someone that shouldn't have left.

704
00:54:01,047 --> 00:54:04,749
[SPEAKER_13]: And I say, I wish he could have stayed, but Paul, if you're watching, good luck.

705
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:08,372
[SPEAKER_13]: Good luck on your new position in Wilmington.

[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to thank Paul McGill for his 25 years of service to our community.

709
00:54:15,405 --> 00:54:16,206
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a long time.

710

[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

718
00:54:48,743 --> 00:54:55,526
[SPEAKER_20]: So, you know, I found out relatively recently, we had an art installation that was to open our parks.

719
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:59,882
[SPEAKER_20]: funded by a Medford resident, funded by the Medford Arts Council.

720
00:55:00,842 --> 00:55:12,529
[SPEAKER_20]: And the idea was to have, you know, discussion-provoking and thought-provoking art installation around the issues of racism and white supremacy.

721
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:18,053
[SPEAKER_20]: And I was disappointed to learn that

722
00:55:18,803 --> 00:55:20,084
[SPEAKER_20]: That installation had gone up.

723
00:55:20,164 --> 00:55:24,606
[SPEAKER_20]: Again, this was funded with city money approved by our parks commission on multiple occasions.

724
00:55:25,307 --> 00:55:29,909
[SPEAKER_20]: It was installed at a local city park and within a few days it had been torn down.

725
00:55:31,450 --> 00:55:37,774
[SPEAKER_20]: And then it was, I think, crowdfunded again to find the money to print it, install it, put it up again.

726
00:55:37,794 --> 00:55:40,355
[SPEAKER_20]: And once again, it was torn down.

727
00:55:41,456 --> 00:55:46,839
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think, you know, we should thank the artist, a Medford resident here,

728
00:55:47,421 --> 00:56:05,531
[SPEAKER_20]: for the effort to go through this but I also think it's important that we hear from from her and you know what went into this and maybe have some discussions about why this happened multiple times in our community and you know

729
00:56:06,107 --> 00:56:07,308
[SPEAKER_20]: The idea was to have discussions.

730
00:56:07,488 --> 00:56:10,690
[SPEAKER_20]: I think the art installations weren't up long enough for us to have those discussions.

731
00:56:11,290 --> 00:56:12,951
[SPEAKER_20]: So maybe we can have some of them here today.

732
00:56:13,171 --> 00:56:20,715
[SPEAKER_20]: And I know that we do have the artist here to speak on this matter, if we want to hear from her as well.

733
00:56:20,896 --> 00:56:21,256
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

734
00:56:21,476 --> 00:56:24,318
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

735
00:56:24,938 --> 00:56:28,420
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Councilor Bears, seconded by Vice-President Aik.

736
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:29,300
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening.

737
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:30,361
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address of the record, please.

738
00:56:31,842 --> 00:56:32,562
[SPEAKER_10]: Julianne Otis, 35 Brookings.

739
00:56:35,131 --> 00:56:38,233
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much to the President and the Council for this recognition.

740
00:56:38,994 --> 00:56:47,080
[SPEAKER_10]: I was funded by the City of Medford through the Medford Arts Council to install my artwork, Textbook Behavior, in multiple parks in the city for 10 weeks.

741
00:56:47,981 --> 00:56:59,169
[SPEAKER_10]: This visual artwork combines 1950s textbook illustrations with humorous and earnest captions, as well as poetry, I'm a poet, that highlights the impact of racial inequity.

742
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:08,094
[SPEAKER_10]: The council, the Medford Arts Council, commissioned this work as a way to creatively and compassionately confront racism in Medford.

743
00:57:08,775 --> 00:57:15,098
[SPEAKER_10]: And the artwork used poetic and provocative wordplay to challenge racist narratives and paint portraits of healing.

744
00:57:16,479 --> 00:57:25,844
[SPEAKER_10]: I proposed textbook behavior to the Arts Council because I have seen a deep divide continuing in Medford and wanted to invite a dialogue about systemic racism in our city.

745
00:57:26,966 --> 00:57:33,367
[SPEAKER_10]: Luckily, this is one of the funding priorities of the Medford Arts Council, which is a rarity in our current city government.

746
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:40,749
[SPEAKER_10]: I installed the artwork in three parks in Medford, Morrison Park, Duggar Park, and Tufts Park.

747
00:57:41,789 --> 00:57:44,170
[SPEAKER_10]: It subsequently was vandalized and ripped down.

748
00:57:45,470 --> 00:57:50,831
[SPEAKER_10]: Medford residents came together and fundraised so that the artwork could be reprinted and reinstalled.

749
00:57:51,891 --> 00:57:55,232
[SPEAKER_10]: The second time I installed it in Morrison Park, it was ripped down within 45 minutes.

750
00:57:57,335 --> 00:58:04,659
[SPEAKER_10]: Bear in mind, my contact information and the website for the project were clearly invisible on every single pieces of this art.

751
00:58:05,759 --> 00:58:12,823
[SPEAKER_10]: At this point, I called Medford PD, sorry, Medford Police Department and began chatting with the neighbors about the work and about the vandalism.

752
00:58:14,195 --> 00:58:21,058
[SPEAKER_10]: Shortly thereafter, Officer Calnan and very wisely had us leave the neighborhood before continuing our conversation.

753
00:58:21,078 --> 00:58:36,125
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to pause here and say that his handling of this case has been exceptional, and he displayed amazing sensitivity in understanding what the neighborhood needed, what the neighbors who lived in that area needed, and what would best support the city in this conversation.

754
00:58:37,358 --> 00:58:45,365
[SPEAKER_10]: Officer Calinan indicated that he knew exactly who had vandalized and stolen the work, and I'm very grateful for his handling of the case, which will be going to court soon.

755
00:58:46,967 --> 00:58:55,835
[SPEAKER_10]: It's deeply concerning to me that artwork that provokes dialogue about dismantling racism in our community is met with defacement and theft instead of open dialogue.

756
00:58:56,795 --> 00:59:01,620
[SPEAKER_10]: It's even more concerning to me that we can see these same type of systems playing out in city government.

757
00:59:02,875 --> 00:59:18,423
[SPEAKER_10]: When the second incident occurred, one of the neighbors I spoke to in Morrison Park contacted someone at the Parks Commission who denied that I had permission to install this artwork, despite the fact that I had presented the project personally at two Parks Commission meetings.

758
00:59:19,484 --> 00:59:32,491
[SPEAKER_10]: These presentations included a description of the project, already funded by the city, a sample of the artwork, the website to see all the works that had been commissioned, and my contact information.

759
00:59:33,479 --> 00:59:43,628
[SPEAKER_10]: In my second meeting with the Parks Commission, I submitted the specific locations where the work would be installed, and permission was approved, and again invited everyone to come participate with the work.

760
00:59:45,270 --> 00:59:55,058
[SPEAKER_10]: After the second incident of vandalism and theft, the Parks Commission asked me to not reinstall the work, but to attend another meeting so that they could approve the artwork.

761
00:59:56,144 --> 01:00:06,867
[SPEAKER_10]: They also said that there had been complaints about the artwork, but declined to tell me who or to put me in touch with anyone to be able to continue dialogue with those members of the community.

762
01:00:08,223 --> 01:00:11,465
[SPEAKER_10]: Logistically, all of this communication was beside the point.

763
01:00:11,825 --> 01:00:22,031
[SPEAKER_10]: Since I'm a contractor who had already been commissioned and paid $6,000 by the city, and as far as I was concerned, the work was complete, save for the online public event that I'm hosting at the end of October.

764
01:00:22,572 --> 01:00:26,034
[SPEAKER_10]: This event is about having compassion in conversations about racism.

765
01:00:27,182 --> 01:00:33,747
[SPEAKER_10]: The only reason I reinstalled the first time is because Medford came together to fund the reinstallation.

766
01:00:34,447 --> 01:00:41,893
[SPEAKER_10]: After it was ripped down a second time, I moved on and began preparing for its next contracted installation in the next city where I'm presenting.

767
01:00:43,614 --> 01:00:46,356
[SPEAKER_10]: As a contractor, the communication was irrelevant.

768
01:00:46,496 --> 01:00:47,216
[SPEAKER_10]: The work was done.

769
01:00:47,637 --> 01:00:50,559
[SPEAKER_10]: But as a Medford citizen, I was disgusted.

770
01:00:51,584 --> 01:00:59,210
[SPEAKER_10]: The Parks Commission wanted to act as censors and arbiters of anti-racism artwork, which is disturbing on many levels.

771
01:01:00,191 --> 01:01:03,513
[SPEAKER_10]: It was clearly the anti-racism major- What information, Mr. President, if I could?

772
01:01:03,533 --> 01:01:04,774
[SPEAKER_17]: What information, Councilor Marks?

773
01:01:05,034 --> 01:01:19,766
[SPEAKER_17]: Just so I understand, because when you say the artwork, you're saying they originally approved and went on a website and saw all your artwork and then approved the artwork as well as giving you approval to use the parks.

774
01:01:20,464 --> 01:01:25,807
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I'll answer that question, and another one which is the first time I came on and presented the artwork.

775
01:01:26,488 --> 01:01:32,131
[SPEAKER_10]: I presented my past work, I presented a full description which is the same as what I just described for you.

776
01:01:32,691 --> 01:01:34,792
[SPEAKER_10]: I presented a sample from the commission works.

777
01:01:35,293 --> 01:01:41,757
[SPEAKER_10]: I presented a website where they could see all eight of the works that were going to be put in that had already been approved by the city.

778
01:01:42,617 --> 01:01:44,818
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I also provided my contact information.

779
01:01:45,078 --> 01:01:56,343
[SPEAKER_10]: Before I presented, there was another artist who was told not to present her artwork because they did not have time to see the artwork and it wasn't their job to approve the artwork.

780
01:01:56,723 --> 01:01:59,364
[SPEAKER_10]: They said that to her before I presented.

781
01:02:00,965 --> 01:02:02,286
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to make sure we're talking.

782
01:02:02,607 --> 01:02:05,429
[SPEAKER_17]: You're saying by the park board or some other entity?

783
01:02:05,689 --> 01:02:10,073
[SPEAKER_10]: The Medford Arts Council commissioned and selected my work and paid me $6,000.

784
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:12,095
[SPEAKER_10]: The Medford Arts Council.

785
01:02:12,115 --> 01:02:14,757
[SPEAKER_17]: They can't approve to put something up in a public park.

786
01:02:14,797 --> 01:02:17,359
[SPEAKER_17]: That has to be done by the Parks Commission.

787
01:02:17,619 --> 01:02:19,021
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, the Parks Commission.

788
01:02:19,041 --> 01:02:21,923
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to make sure we're on the same page.

789
01:02:22,624 --> 01:02:25,987
[SPEAKER_17]: So you're saying the Park Commission was the one that approved

790
01:02:26,647 --> 01:02:30,229
[SPEAKER_10]: whatever eight, eight, they approved it being accessible.

791
01:02:30,509 --> 01:02:32,891
[SPEAKER_10]: They approved, they approved the locations.

792
01:02:32,991 --> 01:02:40,935
[SPEAKER_10]: They proved the number of works, the size of the work, the materials it was printed upon the length of duration for which it would be in there.

793
01:02:40,955 --> 01:02:43,977
[SPEAKER_17]: So you're saying that was all in a making sure it was yes.

794
01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:45,098
[SPEAKER_10]: The parks commission.

795
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:47,279
[SPEAKER_10]: I wonder that boat happened just so we have that.

796
01:02:47,439 --> 01:02:51,501
[SPEAKER_10]: So I met with them in March, 2021 and may 2021.

797
01:02:52,162 --> 01:02:54,943
[SPEAKER_10]: And I also corresponded with them in April of 2021.

798
01:02:57,230 --> 01:03:03,474
[SPEAKER_10]: but they asked me to come back to that third meeting to present about the specific locations at that May meeting.

799
01:03:03,494 --> 01:03:08,217
[SPEAKER_17]: So when was the actual vote, if you could, just, I know you just- May 2021.

800
01:03:08,418 --> 01:03:08,538
[SPEAKER_17]: May 2021.

801
01:03:08,918 --> 01:03:15,802
[SPEAKER_17]: And that encompassed the approval to be in the PACS and the approval- For this specific project.

802
01:03:15,842 --> 01:03:16,043
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

803
01:03:16,303 --> 01:03:16,423
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

804
01:03:16,443 --> 01:03:17,263
[SPEAKER_17]: So that was May 2021.

805
01:03:17,664 --> 01:03:18,644
[SPEAKER_10]: That was May 2021.

806
01:03:18,704 --> 01:03:20,145
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you have a date?

807
01:03:22,067 --> 01:03:23,027
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I could provide it.

808
01:03:23,327 --> 01:03:23,568
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

809
01:03:23,988 --> 01:03:25,369
[SPEAKER_17]: I think they meet, when do they meet?

810
01:03:26,667 --> 01:03:28,069
[SPEAKER_17]: First Monday, okay, so we could find out.

811
01:03:28,310 --> 01:03:31,235
[SPEAKER_10]: Kevin Bailey surely would have the Zoom meeting and reporting.

812
01:03:31,255 --> 01:03:32,056
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

813
01:03:32,457 --> 01:03:32,657
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

814
01:03:33,393 --> 01:03:41,934
[SPEAKER_10]: So in my first meeting with the commission, another artist on the agenda before me was told not to show a presentation of her work and just give a summary since there was very little time available.

815
01:03:42,655 --> 01:03:53,536
[SPEAKER_10]: So I do wanna also mention though that there are some members of the Parks Department who reached out to me after finding out about that email that was sent to me, and they let me know that they were not consulted on that action.

816
01:03:53,937 --> 01:04:01,758
[SPEAKER_10]: So that email to me asking me to come back in and have the artwork reviewed, that was not a communication that came from the entire Parks Commission.

817
01:04:02,898 --> 01:04:21,808
[SPEAKER_10]: This person who reached out to me and said that they were not informed about this email sent to me said that they would have dissented if it had been brought to a vote, that they vehemently opposed the request to attempt to censure the artwork, and that, and she said that I had made very clear the nature of the content of the project.

818
01:04:22,549 --> 01:04:25,130
[SPEAKER_10]: So you can see this in the Zoom recordings both March 2021 and May 2021.

819
01:04:27,264 --> 01:04:33,946
[SPEAKER_10]: because I did the entire presentation at both of those meetings and invited a conversation about the content at both of those meetings.

820
01:04:34,747 --> 01:04:38,088
[SPEAKER_10]: In addition, I want to mention that the mayor's response was milquetoast at best.

821
01:04:38,628 --> 01:04:46,991
[SPEAKER_10]: She did not condemn the vandalism or theft, nor did she make any statements that her administration would support anti-racism public programs.

822
01:04:47,911 --> 01:04:56,297
[SPEAKER_10]: Her response to the first incident of vandalism was to help me report it to the police chief, which I found out later from Officer Calman was never recorded in a police report.

823
01:04:56,317 --> 01:05:03,862
[SPEAKER_10]: Her response to the second incident of vandalism was an email that read, Julianne, I will look into this, Brianna.

824
01:05:04,562 --> 01:05:05,003
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

825
01:05:05,343 --> 01:05:09,266
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the entirety of the communication that I received from the mayor's office on this work.

826
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:11,541
[SPEAKER_10]: In closing, I'll try to be brief.

827
01:05:12,341 --> 01:05:12,961
[SPEAKER_10]: Two more things.

828
01:05:13,521 --> 01:05:24,506
[SPEAKER_10]: This artwork was commissioned by the city to promote dialogue about systemic racism and I'm glad that I at least was able to talk with a few neighbors who had never had conversations before about white privilege and white fragility.

829
01:05:25,146 --> 01:05:28,668
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are the conversations that are the most important to have.

830
01:05:29,195 --> 01:05:36,837
[SPEAKER_10]: And they take skill, they take training, they take funding, they take staff hours, and they take really well-designed programming.

831
01:05:37,497 --> 01:05:47,140
[SPEAKER_10]: Compassionate and creative conversations that don't put people on the defensive and that invite them to talk about race in a safe way are desperately needed in our town.

832
01:05:47,681 --> 01:05:52,002
[SPEAKER_10]: And I wanna know what the city council and what the current administration is doing to make that happen.

833
01:05:52,882 --> 01:06:03,110
[SPEAKER_10]: I also want to know what specific resources our mayoral candidates will put towards anti-racism public programs that will dismantle white supremacy and racial inequity.

834
01:06:03,651 --> 01:06:07,294
[SPEAKER_10]: This is not just about diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility.

835
01:06:07,394 --> 01:06:20,744
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm talking about hiring consultants who are well-trained in community anti-racism work to offer citywide programs that address the deep divide that I see out there every day.

836
01:06:21,980 --> 01:06:28,883
[SPEAKER_10]: I want the dialogue about race, white privilege, white fragility to be a safe one and even an inviting one.

837
01:06:29,564 --> 01:06:37,387
[SPEAKER_10]: And this radio silence on race and this nonspecific commitment to social justice roadmap has run out of ramp, in my opinion.

838
01:06:37,928 --> 01:06:42,210
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's time to put dollars and hours and heart commitment into this kind of programming.

839
01:06:43,007 --> 01:06:48,569
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you very much to the city, to the Medford Arts Council for commissioning me to do this work.

840
01:06:49,149 --> 01:06:53,750
[SPEAKER_10]: And I thank the city council very much for your time and for your response to these requests.

841
01:06:54,851 --> 01:06:58,992
[SPEAKER_10]: I also brought examples of the work, and I'm wondering if you might have additional examples.

842
01:07:00,052 --> 01:07:00,393
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

843
01:07:00,933 --> 01:07:01,533
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Julianne.

844
01:07:02,013 --> 01:07:02,393
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

845
01:07:08,335 --> 01:07:09,075
[SPEAKER_13]: Questions of Julianne.

846
01:07:10,776 --> 01:07:11,196
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Morell.

847
01:07:12,383 --> 01:07:13,545
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President Julian.

848
01:07:13,565 --> 01:07:22,296
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much for being here for taking the time to explain the process for for presenting this so many times I was able to see some of the artwork was on.

849
01:07:22,696 --> 01:07:24,959
[SPEAKER_08]: It was still up during open studios.

850
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:29,986
[SPEAKER_08]: So I really appreciate your work and your efforts as a resident and an artist to

851
01:07:31,207 --> 01:07:35,791
[SPEAKER_08]: foster these conversations in a way that is passive and invites people to engage in them.

852
01:07:36,231 --> 01:07:41,795
[SPEAKER_08]: And perhaps some people may feel uncomfortable, but this invites conversation in a different way, which, you know, was your intention.

853
01:07:41,935 --> 01:07:47,760
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to talk too long on this, because Councilor Beresford, the point, you know, this is exactly as you said, this is to foster conversation.

854
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:50,782
[SPEAKER_08]: And if we can't even get to that point.

855
01:07:51,623 --> 01:07:57,529
[SPEAKER_08]: Clearly there's a lot more work we have to do it's always been apparent what there's a lot of work we have to do there's a lot of work, every city has to do.

856
01:07:58,169 --> 01:08:05,977
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of investment needed in this area but the consistent vandalism and the the hard stop of these potential conversations is very concerning.

857
01:08:07,118 --> 01:08:13,247
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'd love to see more action by the administration and by the city council and our power to foster this kind of work.

858
01:08:13,307 --> 01:08:19,856
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, I thank you as a resident and an artist for taking this upon yourself and going through the channels to bring this forward.

859
01:08:20,097 --> 01:08:20,637
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you.

860
01:08:21,018 --> 01:08:21,298
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

861
01:08:23,695 --> 01:08:26,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President, and Julian, thank you very much for your artwork.

862
01:08:27,358 --> 01:08:31,322
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm absolutely horrified that this was not only pulled down once, but twice.

863
01:08:31,342 --> 01:08:34,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Just completely unacceptable.

864
01:08:35,405 --> 01:08:40,269
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like I'm using that word a lot tonight, but it's completely unacceptable that that was torn down.

865
01:08:41,210 --> 01:08:47,392
[SPEAKER_05]: And it shows you that there is still a long way we need to go as a community.

866
01:08:48,132 --> 01:08:54,914
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you talked about promoting dialogue and conversation, and that's what it's all about.

867
01:08:55,274 --> 01:08:56,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it easy conversation?

868
01:08:56,595 --> 01:08:58,515
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but we need to have that conversation.

869
01:08:58,955 --> 01:09:00,576
[SPEAKER_05]: And that outwork, I think, is part of that.

870
01:09:01,796 --> 01:09:03,777
[SPEAKER_05]: It's unfortunate that it was pulled down.

871
01:09:04,917 --> 01:09:10,399
[SPEAKER_05]: If I may ask you, and I was trying to take a note while you were speaking, so I apologize if I missed this piece.

872
01:09:11,414 --> 01:09:12,620
[SPEAKER_05]: It was taken out twice.

873
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:16,058
[SPEAKER_05]: And the third time was when you.

874
01:09:17,594 --> 01:09:19,575
[SPEAKER_05]: told not to put it up or sure.

875
01:09:19,735 --> 01:09:33,222
[SPEAKER_10]: So as a contractor, I was paid for this work to be installed once the it was vandalized and ripped down it from Morrison Park, and then it was vandalized, ripped down but not stolen at Duggar Park.

876
01:09:33,802 --> 01:09:37,103
[SPEAKER_10]: The installation at Tufts Park remained intact the entire 10 weeks.

877
01:09:37,764 --> 01:09:41,886
[SPEAKER_10]: So after the first incident of vandalism and theft, I thought, you know,

878
01:09:42,970 --> 01:09:56,222
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, okay, I'll crowd source and crowd fund and see if we can get enough met for residents and luckily we got enough going on that we got enough to be able to to pay me for my time as an artist to install and also to be able to reprint the artworks.

879
01:09:56,302 --> 01:10:00,105
[SPEAKER_10]: These are giant vinyl banners like six foot giant vinyl banners.

880
01:10:01,556 --> 01:10:05,117
[SPEAKER_10]: and reinstalled them in Duggar Park and in Morrison Park.

881
01:10:05,917 --> 01:10:19,380
[SPEAKER_10]: I had printed out little notices to hand out to all the neighbors in both of those areas, just to clarify, here's my phone number, and also here's the number of Medford Police Department, in case you have any information about the first theft and vandalism.

882
01:10:20,321 --> 01:10:27,262
[SPEAKER_10]: I forgot them at home, so I went home, got them, came back, it was 45 minutes later and somebody had taken box cutters and ripped them down.

883
01:10:27,862 --> 01:10:29,663
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're not talking like, you know,

884
01:10:31,244 --> 01:10:35,087
[SPEAKER_10]: So Officer Calnan indicated that he knew the individual who did this.

885
01:10:35,407 --> 01:10:41,593
[SPEAKER_10]: There were three to four individuals total who actually took box cutters and did this, but that's a court matter that is going to court.

886
01:10:41,913 --> 01:10:42,914
[SPEAKER_10]: He's been outstanding.

887
01:10:42,954 --> 01:10:48,819
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, I can't say enough about the sensitivity that he displayed and really understanding how best to go about this.

888
01:10:49,820 --> 01:10:55,184
[SPEAKER_10]: But after the second time, it was ripped down and stolen and vandalized.

889
01:10:55,985 --> 01:10:57,827
[SPEAKER_10]: I, you know, I was done.

890
01:10:57,847 --> 01:10:59,768
[SPEAKER_10]: I was already paid as a contractor.

891
01:10:59,869 --> 01:11:00,549
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm complete.

892
01:11:00,629 --> 01:11:05,754
[SPEAKER_10]: I did one round of crowdfunding because I do care, but I didn't really want to do it a second time.

893
01:11:06,194 --> 01:11:10,037
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was already prepping for the artwork to be done in the next city over anyway.

894
01:11:10,178 --> 01:11:13,701
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just, you know, I got a lot of heart, but not that much heart.

895
01:11:15,870 --> 01:11:18,213
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just it's just listening to the story.

896
01:11:18,273 --> 01:11:19,434
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just it's horrifying.

897
01:11:20,115 --> 01:11:21,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Because here you are trying to do a good thing.

898
01:11:21,937 --> 01:11:24,119
[SPEAKER_05]: You went through the process of getting it approved.

899
01:11:25,721 --> 01:11:30,546
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds like the park commission knew completely what they were approving.

900
01:11:31,887 --> 01:11:33,669
[SPEAKER_05]: So you went through that process, which is unfortunate.

901
01:11:33,689 --> 01:11:37,013
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's really, you know, you know,

902
01:11:37,648 --> 01:12:00,211
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like if the administration was truly committed to this, you would have your artwork or to see protection especially not once but having a pulled out twice but you should have as an artist as well receive some sort of support from from I think the administration from the community or that, you know, I mean, I'm glad that you had a pleasant experience with the police department, but it sounds also like there wasn't it you said there wasn't a police reported.

903
01:12:02,013 --> 01:12:03,755
[SPEAKER_10]: Not the first one, not the first one.

904
01:12:04,176 --> 01:12:05,958
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, there's a lot of layers here.

905
01:12:05,978 --> 01:12:18,355
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a lot of layers here we're not going to deconstruct all of them tonight, but I hope that in my sharing of the story of the creation installation vandalism and recreation of the work.

906
01:12:18,775 --> 01:12:29,002
[SPEAKER_10]: I can at least point to the importance that we have this conversation in the city now, you know, that this be funded in a real way, that staff hours go to this in a real way.

907
01:12:29,462 --> 01:12:32,985
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, we're not going to tease apart, you know, because we're going to constantly have this.

908
01:12:33,525 --> 01:12:39,349
[SPEAKER_10]: The right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing, or it was this department's fault, or it was that department's fault, or it was the mayor's fault.

909
01:12:39,369 --> 01:12:40,970
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I'm not interested in that.

910
01:12:41,130 --> 01:12:48,575
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm interested in actually creating community wide programming that reaches all Medford residents, no matter what generation they are.

911
01:12:48,875 --> 01:13:00,520
[SPEAKER_17]: no matter where they came from, if they were born here, if they weren't born here, Mr. President, what information Council about when you mentioned community wide programming, how is this publicized?

912
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:01,820
[SPEAKER_17]: How is it advertised?

913
01:13:02,540 --> 01:13:09,583
[SPEAKER_17]: You may be aware, you're the contractor, the park board may be aware, the mayor's office may be aware, but how is this advertised?

914
01:13:09,603 --> 01:13:10,944
[SPEAKER_17]: Because you said the thing was,

915
01:13:11,724 --> 01:13:14,706
[SPEAKER_17]: partly to bring up conversations and dialogue.

916
01:13:15,486 --> 01:13:19,148
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm just wondering, do these just appear in a park?

917
01:13:19,989 --> 01:13:28,654
[SPEAKER_17]: And how are you going to gather dialogue and conversation when no one knows what's going on, something just apparently appears and people reacted?

918
01:13:28,854 --> 01:13:36,879
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, so, so I think part of it, we have to realize maybe, you know, some of the blame pie was how is this sent out to the community?

919
01:13:37,099 --> 01:13:38,000
[SPEAKER_17]: I couldn't agree more.

920
01:13:38,020 --> 01:13:39,081
[SPEAKER_17]: To notify, right?

921
01:13:39,161 --> 01:13:40,121
[SPEAKER_10]: I couldn't agree more.

922
01:13:40,321 --> 01:13:46,226
[SPEAKER_10]: Where was the conversation and statement about this artwork coming in that invited dialogue amongst all city residents?

923
01:13:46,246 --> 01:13:48,067
[SPEAKER_17]: So why wasn't that part of this grant?

924
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:49,869
[SPEAKER_17]: Why wasn't this, right?

925
01:13:49,969 --> 01:13:53,511
[SPEAKER_17]: Why wasn't this part of the total picture?

926
01:13:54,132 --> 01:13:56,473
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think what we see right now is you're right.

927
01:13:56,854 --> 01:13:58,575
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a lot of division in this community.

928
01:13:59,135 --> 01:14:03,599
[SPEAKER_17]: And to me, one way to head that off is to have open dialogue.

929
01:14:04,299 --> 01:14:08,081
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, it would have been nice maybe to promote this like every other event.

930
01:14:08,381 --> 01:14:12,963
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I'm going to an event Oktoberfest and and the may has been promoting that up and down.

931
01:14:13,243 --> 01:14:15,704
[SPEAKER_17]: It would have been nice to have some promotion.

932
01:14:16,544 --> 01:14:19,785
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, maybe you would have got people out saying, Hey, geez, what is this?

933
01:14:19,865 --> 01:14:20,826
[SPEAKER_17]: What does this stand for?

934
01:14:21,066 --> 01:14:21,626
[SPEAKER_17]: Why is this?

935
01:14:21,686 --> 01:14:21,906
[SPEAKER_17]: Why?

936
01:14:22,126 --> 01:14:22,566
[SPEAKER_17]: Who knows?

937
01:14:23,046 --> 01:14:24,307
[SPEAKER_17]: But maybe we would have had that.

938
01:14:24,327 --> 01:14:26,528
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't think we allow that to take place.

939
01:14:27,289 --> 01:14:34,000
[SPEAKER_10]: I would love to have had this event and this art installation promoted in the same way as other festivals and arts events in our community.

940
01:14:34,481 --> 01:14:35,342
[SPEAKER_10]: That would have been lovely.

941
01:14:35,362 --> 01:14:37,406
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. President, if I may.

942
01:14:39,755 --> 01:14:40,695
[SPEAKER_20]: You good with custom marks?

943
01:14:40,875 --> 01:14:41,536
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm good.

944
01:14:42,056 --> 01:14:47,858
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think you know what, how it was publicized and the way a trend, you know, transpired.

945
01:14:48,439 --> 01:14:55,182
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think was enough notification really to alert residents that first of all, there's something going on, right?

946
01:14:55,542 --> 01:14:56,562
[SPEAKER_17]: Love to go down and check it out.

947
01:14:56,582 --> 01:14:59,743
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't know about it until I heard, you know, someone else saying it was ripped down.

948
01:14:59,764 --> 01:15:01,004
[SPEAKER_17]: I would have loved to went by.

949
01:15:01,024 --> 01:15:03,125
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm very active with the Methodist council.

950
01:15:03,585 --> 01:15:03,766
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

951
01:15:03,806 --> 01:15:06,228
[SPEAKER_17]: So, first of all, I would have loved to hear it.

952
01:15:06,549 --> 01:15:17,040
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think, secondly, I think it would have head off, maybe some of this supposed intention or whatever existed, it would have headed it off so I just think that that's the way I would have handled it.

953
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:21,165
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, and that that's exactly the question I was going to have is.

954
01:15:22,438 --> 01:15:40,173
[SPEAKER_20]: Why, why wasn't this put out there we get a lot of press releases we have a city newsletter we have things coming out from different departments, you know, pretty much all the time we have social media, you know, this wasn't advertised and I think two things here really speak to me one the fact that it initially wasn't even really talked about initially it wasn't put out.

955
01:15:40,854 --> 01:15:52,898
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, it's a city funded initiative comes from the Arts Council going into our parks, and it's addressing what this council has said is a major priority what the city administration is that is a major priority, and it got no play no advertisement.

956
01:15:53,319 --> 01:15:55,940
[SPEAKER_20]: I didn't know about it if people on this council didn't know about it.

957
01:15:56,820 --> 01:16:02,042
[SPEAKER_20]: And we represent the city we're in City Hall more than more than most other folks than most people didn't know about it.

958
01:16:02,782 --> 01:16:04,523
[SPEAKER_20]: And then the second piece is.

959
01:16:05,703 --> 01:16:09,765
[SPEAKER_20]: we didn't hear about what happened to the installation either.

960
01:16:09,825 --> 01:16:14,928
[SPEAKER_20]: There was no statement, there was no discussion, there was a few sentences of an email.

961
01:16:15,529 --> 01:16:32,959
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's the question I think when you look at both of those, it reads to me as part of the larger problem, which is we say we wanna do something, we say we wanna talk about it, and I think you made this point actually about a year and a half ago, which is we can talk about it, but what are we doing?

962
01:16:33,359 --> 01:16:34,940
[SPEAKER_20]: And the doing piece was never done.

963
01:16:36,105 --> 01:16:38,046
[SPEAKER_20]: And so, I have another resolution on here tonight.

964
01:16:38,066 --> 01:16:41,387
[SPEAKER_20]: We're gonna talk about it in a minute, which is to ask, what have we been doing?

965
01:16:41,927 --> 01:16:46,949
[SPEAKER_20]: But I think what we're hearing here tonight and what we probably knew already is we're clearly not doing enough.

966
01:16:47,369 --> 01:16:49,850
[SPEAKER_20]: And in some cases, we're not doing anything at all.

967
01:16:50,690 --> 01:16:55,912
[SPEAKER_20]: And that is a shame to say the very least, but I think it also means we're not gonna move forward.

968
01:16:56,192 --> 01:16:58,233
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'm just glad that this is out there.

969
01:16:58,253 --> 01:17:00,034
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm glad that we're having a discussion tonight.

970
01:17:00,494 --> 01:17:03,735
[SPEAKER_20]: I hope that other folks are hearing this as well.

971
01:17:04,695 --> 01:17:10,098
[SPEAKER_20]: And I hope, you know, to be to be honest that that we hear more about this in the in the days and weeks to come.

972
01:17:10,938 --> 01:17:11,298
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

973
01:17:11,459 --> 01:17:28,867
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President, I think Councilor Marks and Council bears bring up a really good point in that the intention of this art was to drive conversation that didn't happen in the way envisioned because of the vandalism, but there was multiple other opportunities there was a missed opportunity as far as promoting there was a missed opportunity.

974
01:17:29,407 --> 01:17:30,768
[SPEAKER_08]: as far as sharing what happened.

975
01:17:31,189 --> 01:17:34,612
[SPEAKER_08]: These are opportunities for conversation and for dialogue and to do better.

976
01:17:35,152 --> 01:17:38,715
[SPEAKER_08]: And if it weren't for a receptive council, how would we hear about this?

977
01:17:39,436 --> 01:17:41,637
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think Councilor Bears brings up a really good point.

978
01:17:41,677 --> 01:17:50,064
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Marks brings up a really good point and we're having this conversation now, but the conversation was intended to be had by the public, by the residents.

979
01:17:50,204 --> 01:17:51,766
[SPEAKER_08]: We get the pulpit every Tuesday.

980
01:17:52,306 --> 01:17:57,991
[SPEAKER_08]: We want that opportunity to have more people have this type of dialogue and that was missed on multiple accounts.

981
01:17:59,548 --> 01:17:59,888
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

982
01:18:00,689 --> 01:18:06,936
[SPEAKER_13]: Julian was, was, was, was the actual one done at Bopax?

983
01:18:07,017 --> 01:18:09,399
[SPEAKER_10]: The first incident happened in June.

984
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:14,245
[SPEAKER_10]: It was torn down and stolen from Morrison Park, all three pieces there.

985
01:18:14,966 --> 01:18:20,212
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the two pieces in Duggar Park were torn down, but left there.

986
01:18:20,856 --> 01:18:22,377
[SPEAKER_10]: So then I cut those off and took them.

987
01:18:22,477 --> 01:18:25,939
[SPEAKER_10]: Once they're torn and the grommets are toast, you have to reorder.

988
01:18:26,799 --> 01:18:28,060
[SPEAKER_10]: So that was the first incident.

989
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:31,882
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the second incident, the ones in Duggar Park stayed up.

990
01:18:32,322 --> 01:18:35,624
[SPEAKER_10]: The ones that had originally been installed in Tufts Park were continuing up.

991
01:18:36,024 --> 01:18:40,687
[SPEAKER_10]: And the ones in Morrison Park were torn down with box cutters within half an hour.

992
01:18:42,488 --> 01:18:45,729
[SPEAKER_13]: You said the police arrested somebody for this?

993
01:18:45,769 --> 01:18:46,250
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, they did.

994
01:18:46,290 --> 01:18:47,870
[SPEAKER_13]: Were they juveniles or were they adults?

995
01:18:48,171 --> 01:18:48,611
[SPEAKER_10]: I do not know.

996
01:18:50,350 --> 01:18:51,231
[SPEAKER_13]: where they met the residents.

997
01:18:53,432 --> 01:18:54,153
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe so.

998
01:18:55,434 --> 01:18:55,734
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

999
01:18:55,834 --> 01:18:57,515
[SPEAKER_13]: And I am sorry for what's what's happened to you.

1000
01:18:57,696 --> 01:18:58,096
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1001
01:18:59,397 --> 01:19:02,839
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1002
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:04,881
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1003
01:19:05,962 --> 01:19:06,922
[SPEAKER_13]: Who's who is it?

1004
01:19:06,963 --> 01:19:07,503
[SPEAKER_13]: Where we've been?

1005
01:19:07,643 --> 01:19:08,123
[SPEAKER_13]: That's correct.

1006
01:19:09,985 --> 01:19:10,205
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1007
01:19:10,265 --> 01:19:10,605
[SPEAKER_13]: Meredith.

1008
01:19:10,805 --> 01:19:11,966
[SPEAKER_13]: Where uh where is Meredith?

1009
01:19:12,547 --> 01:19:12,787
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.

1010
01:19:14,133 --> 01:19:14,914
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, there you are, okay.

1011
01:19:14,934 --> 01:19:16,935
[SPEAKER_13]: Meredith, name and address of the record, please.

1012
01:19:17,136 --> 01:19:20,378
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Meredith McKelvey, 105 Andrew Street.

1013
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:24,802
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm one of the co-chairs from the Medford Arts Council.

1014
01:19:24,822 --> 01:19:31,828
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanted to speak a little bit to what Councilor Marks was saying about the advertising on our end.

1015
01:19:32,788 --> 01:19:38,833
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally wasn't on the council when we advertised for textbook behavior, but I have to assume that we

1016
01:19:39,594 --> 01:19:43,437
[SPEAKER_01]: We definitely did through our Facebook page as well as our Instagram page.

1017
01:19:44,478 --> 01:19:54,025
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also reposted Julianne's Instagram stories to keep people posted about what had gone on with the tearing down of the posters.

1018
01:19:55,784 --> 01:20:12,194
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we could have maybe done a better job about keeping people in the loop and advertising for it initially, but I just want to remind people that we are a volunteer council and most of us do have full-time jobs, but we try to do the best we can.

1019
01:20:12,274 --> 01:20:14,756
[SPEAKER_01]: And so thank you for that feedback, it's noted.

1020
01:20:15,777 --> 01:20:22,121
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also wanted to say that I think what happened not once, but only twice to her important artwork

1021
01:20:23,041 --> 01:20:28,505
[SPEAKER_01]: has made a very clear statement and reflects the mindset of some of the members of this community.

1022
01:20:28,585 --> 01:20:30,847
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really sad and disheartening.

1023
01:20:32,008 --> 01:20:36,171
[SPEAKER_01]: Julianne spoke about the divide in Medford, and this is obviously a massive issue.

1024
01:20:39,093 --> 01:20:41,175
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't know who tore him down, Mr. President.

1025
01:20:41,875 --> 01:20:44,637
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm not sure it's fair to say members of this community.

1026
01:20:45,117 --> 01:20:50,241
[SPEAKER_17]: So I would just caution the speaker that we don't know who tore him down, Mr. President.

1027
01:20:51,710 --> 01:20:53,652
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to put that out there.

1028
01:20:53,672 --> 01:20:53,772
Okay.

1029
01:20:54,212 --> 01:20:54,612
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fair.

1030
01:20:55,493 --> 01:20:58,355
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but anyway, it's disheartening no matter who tore it down.

1031
01:20:58,876 --> 01:21:05,261
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and this is obviously an issue for not just Medford, but, um, the entire United States.

1032
01:21:06,062 --> 01:21:12,887
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and you know, this type of our artwork is very important, um, to spark these conversations like Julian was saying.

1033
01:21:13,788 --> 01:21:20,113
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I think Councilor bears is about to speak more about some programming, but, um, I think anything the city can do.

1034
01:21:20,751 --> 01:21:28,939
[SPEAKER_01]: to help promote anti-racism education and programming is incredibly imperative and hopefully can be implemented soon.

1035
01:21:28,959 --> 01:21:40,750
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanted to thank Julianne for her powerful artwork and I'm sad that this happened, but it has presented a good opportunity for us to discuss it.

1036
01:21:41,971 --> 01:21:43,973
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you Councilors for your time.

1037
01:21:44,892 --> 01:21:46,274
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Meredith.

1038
01:21:46,574 --> 01:21:47,055
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Bears.

1039
01:21:47,556 --> 01:21:48,697
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1040
01:21:49,418 --> 01:21:54,084
[SPEAKER_20]: I just wanted to say to Meredith, by the way, you know, I think the Arts Council, we know you're a volunteer body.

1041
01:21:54,245 --> 01:21:55,366
[SPEAKER_20]: You're doing what you can.

1042
01:21:55,867 --> 01:21:57,329
[SPEAKER_20]: You have the followers that you have.

1043
01:21:57,975 --> 01:22:01,857
[SPEAKER_20]: It would be, I think when we were talking about outreach, it's how is the city boosting that?

1044
01:22:01,917 --> 01:22:04,678
[SPEAKER_20]: How are we using the resources of the city to get that out there?

1045
01:22:05,518 --> 01:22:09,640
[SPEAKER_20]: So I know it maybe came off a little bit as on the arts council.

1046
01:22:09,980 --> 01:22:18,503
[SPEAKER_20]: You, we know that you do amazing work and you know, the support for that, I think would have been really additive in this situation.

1047
01:22:19,364 --> 01:22:19,684
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1048
01:22:20,244 --> 01:22:20,564
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1049
01:22:21,685 --> 01:22:22,545
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe just to the record, sir.

1050
01:22:23,707 --> 01:22:26,808
[SPEAKER_19]: William Navarre, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

1051
01:22:27,548 --> 01:22:40,973
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm rather alarmed to learn that somebody inside or outside of our community, but coming into our community, decided to sort of censor themselves this important artwork.

1052
01:22:41,774 --> 01:22:45,155
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's a little frustrating, because I wasn't really aware of this artwork before.

1053
01:22:45,195 --> 01:22:47,056
[SPEAKER_19]: So it took me a while to find it on the computer.

1054
01:22:47,436 --> 01:22:49,497
[SPEAKER_19]: And maybe some people at home are also

1055
01:22:51,081 --> 01:22:53,702
[SPEAKER_19]: still unable to like really know what this, what this artwork is.

1056
01:22:53,742 --> 01:22:55,103
[SPEAKER_19]: I was able to find one myself.

1057
01:22:56,664 --> 01:23:03,888
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, it's a drawing sort of in the style of a, uh, of an old, old school comic strip or political cartoon.

1058
01:23:04,308 --> 01:23:11,532
[SPEAKER_19]: And then, and then, uh, shows the family moving in and it says, and that's why everyone in our neighborhood looks like us, you know?

1059
01:23:13,272 --> 01:23:15,794
[SPEAKER_19]: And, uh, so that's, that's one of the ones I found on the computer.

1060
01:23:15,814 --> 01:23:20,016
[SPEAKER_19]: I know there are more and, uh, I know there's a lot of the council can't do,

1061
01:23:21,129 --> 01:23:35,193
[SPEAKER_19]: But one thing they could do, I think, is to look at some of the ones we have prints of here in the chamber and tell the constituents or hold them up to the camera, the viewers at home, to see the artwork that's been censored and shouldn't have been.

1062
01:23:35,353 --> 01:23:37,974
[SPEAKER_19]: And that was supposed to spark a dialogue.

1063
01:23:38,614 --> 01:23:43,176
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think that'd be a good opportunity if somebody wants to do that.

1064
01:23:43,496 --> 01:23:45,276
[SPEAKER_19]: And I shared one that I found myself.

1065
01:23:46,097 --> 01:23:46,377
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks.

1066
01:23:47,197 --> 01:23:47,457
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1067
01:23:50,484 --> 01:23:51,244
[SPEAKER_10]: can just provide that now.

1068
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:52,224
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that'd be great.

1069
01:23:52,304 --> 01:23:53,124
[SPEAKER_10]: I can just provide that now.

1070
01:23:53,605 --> 01:24:03,646
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh Julieannotice.com which is J U L I E A N N O T I S slash textbook behavior.

1071
01:24:04,066 --> 01:24:11,768
[SPEAKER_10]: So, Julieannotice.com slash textbook behavior or if my SEO is up, then you can just Google my name and the name of the installation.

1072
01:24:12,868 --> 01:24:13,228
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1073
01:24:14,828 --> 01:24:16,288
[SPEAKER_13]: So, on the motion by

1074
01:24:20,219 --> 01:24:20,799
[SPEAKER_17]: want to speak?

1075
01:24:20,819 --> 01:24:21,680
[SPEAKER_17]: I think you want to speak.

1076
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:26,683
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening.

1077
01:24:26,723 --> 01:24:27,724
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address of the record, please.

1078
01:24:28,004 --> 01:24:28,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

1079
01:24:28,464 --> 01:24:30,325
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm Jen Lewis, 20 Russell Street.

1080
01:24:31,886 --> 01:24:36,529
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a resident, longtime resident, mom, artist, and educator.

1081
01:24:36,549 --> 01:24:36,569
[SPEAKER_09]: I

1082
01:24:39,810 --> 01:24:46,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Recently, recently a year ago now finished grad school and becoming an educator I'm now teaching at the college level.

1083
01:24:47,062 --> 01:24:48,524
[SPEAKER_09]: And through some of that training.

1084
01:24:48,544 --> 01:24:52,271
[SPEAKER_09]: I learned a lot about the experiences of people who weren't like me.

1085
01:24:53,542 --> 01:24:56,583
[SPEAKER_09]: I learned a lot about how to facilitate conversations about that.

1086
01:24:57,964 --> 01:25:04,687
[SPEAKER_09]: I think a lot of our residents, a lot of people have not had that education.

1087
01:25:05,807 --> 01:25:17,612
[SPEAKER_09]: Just today, thankfully, I'm glad to hear my kids in the public schools are getting a little bit more history of people who are not, who don't look like us, who are not white, who are BIPOC and other.

1088
01:25:18,372 --> 01:25:27,537
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want to make sure that all of our residents, everyone gets an opportunity to learn a little bit more about people's experiences that don't look like them.

1089
01:25:28,277 --> 01:25:31,139
[SPEAKER_09]: It gives us an opportunity to really put ourselves in other people's shoes.

1090
01:25:31,879 --> 01:25:39,623
[SPEAKER_09]: I am so grateful that Julie created this artwork to start some conversation in Medford, but it shouldn't just be the job of the artists.

1091
01:25:40,123 --> 01:25:43,745
[SPEAKER_09]: This should be we declared racism as a public health issue in Medford.

1092
01:25:44,166 --> 01:25:45,126
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a health issue.

1093
01:25:45,266 --> 01:25:46,827
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a equality issue.

1094
01:25:47,308 --> 01:25:51,770
[SPEAKER_09]: It serves impacts so many different areas of everyone's life.

1095
01:25:52,751 --> 01:25:55,032
[SPEAKER_09]: We're all stronger when we're working together.

1096
01:25:55,933 --> 01:26:00,296
[SPEAKER_09]: And I really believe that many of the white members of our community.

1097
01:26:03,154 --> 01:26:22,490
[SPEAKER_09]: would benefit from being able to have some compassionate, open dialogue about racism and about white supremacy and how our current policies today have created some of those, sorry, our policies over time have created so many systems of injustice that exist today.

1098
01:26:23,210 --> 01:26:26,233
[SPEAKER_09]: So having more of these opportunities throughout Medford

1099
01:26:26,633 --> 01:26:43,230
[SPEAKER_09]: Not just through the arts, although the arts are always a powerful way to facilitate conversations, but not just in our schools but with adults, with all of our community members with trained facilitators who are not going to alienate everyone but actually engage people in conversation.

1100
01:26:43,971 --> 01:26:46,633
[SPEAKER_09]: It takes time, it takes money, it takes effort.

1101
01:26:46,754 --> 01:26:48,135
[SPEAKER_09]: Most of all, it takes commitment.

1102
01:26:48,935 --> 01:26:51,678
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's not a commitment I'm seeing from the city overall.

1103
01:26:51,798 --> 01:26:59,585
[SPEAKER_09]: I've heard some lip service all around, and I've heard an awful lot of division.

1104
01:27:00,205 --> 01:27:11,375
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'd really like to hear a lot more plans to move forward and really bring this work to the community to work with the members of our community to understand each other better.

1105
01:27:12,691 --> 01:27:13,071
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1106
01:27:13,572 --> 01:27:14,872
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1107
01:27:16,013 --> 01:27:17,474
[SPEAKER_17]: I agree with that, Mr. President.

1108
01:27:17,934 --> 01:27:24,558
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, if I could, because when we're talking about division, I think that's an important topic.

1109
01:27:25,498 --> 01:27:31,922
[SPEAKER_17]: And I also think it's important, Mr. President, when we say create dialogue, it's not helpful when

1110
01:27:32,663 --> 01:27:38,209
[SPEAKER_17]: people create anonymous websites listing the 10 most racist people in Medford.

1111
01:27:39,111 --> 01:27:40,813
[SPEAKER_17]: That's not helpful either, Mr. President.

1112
01:27:41,193 --> 01:27:47,921
[SPEAKER_17]: So I believe strongly that, you know, if we want to have dialogue and move together as one,

1113
01:27:48,782 --> 01:27:51,104
[SPEAKER_17]: We can't have this back and forth, Mr. President.

1114
01:27:51,504 --> 01:28:10,296
[SPEAKER_17]: And I would hope the same attention to this website, Mr. President, that's currently still out there that names, I believe it's over 10 Method residents as the top racist in the city, some pretty prominent business owners and activists and people in this community.

1115
01:28:10,717 --> 01:28:16,821
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that equally needs to be brought up as well, Mr. President, because in my opinion, that is unacceptable as well.

1116
01:28:17,581 --> 01:28:25,084
[SPEAKER_17]: And that deserves the very same nature, uh, Mr. President of attention, uh, by, uh, the, the authorities as well.

1117
01:28:25,544 --> 01:28:34,287
[SPEAKER_17]: And, uh, I'm under the impression that is being looked at Mr. President, but I want to make sure we, you know, we put all the cards on the table and, and that to be is healthy.

1118
01:28:34,327 --> 01:28:35,147
[SPEAKER_17]: That's dialogue.

1119
01:28:35,368 --> 01:28:36,228
[SPEAKER_17]: That's discussion.

1120
01:28:36,768 --> 01:28:38,529
[SPEAKER_17]: And it can't be one way discussion.

1121
01:28:38,869 --> 01:28:41,810
[SPEAKER_17]: It has to be, uh, throughout the entire community, Mr. President.

1122
01:28:42,170 --> 01:28:42,530
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1123
01:28:42,610 --> 01:28:42,930
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1124
01:28:43,250 --> 01:28:44,811
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm told on the police thing, uh,

1125
01:28:46,023 --> 01:28:55,808
[SPEAKER_13]: what you mentioned that the chief and the detective, they, I think they know who's been paying for the site and who put the site up.

1126
01:28:56,388 --> 01:28:58,569
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's currently with the district attorney's office.

1127
01:28:59,169 --> 01:29:06,693
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think that'll be coming to an end soon, but they have located who owns the site and who's paying for it from what I've been told.

1128
01:29:06,773 --> 01:29:10,955
[SPEAKER_13]: So again, on the motion by Councilor Behr, seconded by Councilor Falco.

1129
01:29:11,856 --> 01:29:12,596
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

1130
01:29:12,616 --> 01:29:13,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

1131
01:29:13,676 --> 01:29:14,277
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

1132
01:29:15,063 --> 01:29:15,904
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

1133
01:29:15,924 --> 01:29:34,504
[SPEAKER_13]: 21557 offered by Council of Mayors being resolved by the Medford City Council that the City Administration report to the Council on anti-racism efforts and trainings conducted under the Mayor's Social Justice Roadmap.

1134
01:29:36,046 --> 01:29:37,007
[SPEAKER_13]: Be it further resolved

1135
01:29:38,234 --> 01:29:53,263
[SPEAKER_13]: that the city administration provide an update on future plans for funding and anti-racist programs and public programming to involve all Medford residents in dismantling systems and structures that perpetuate white supremacy and racial inequality.

1136
01:29:53,563 --> 01:29:54,084
[SPEAKER_13]: Council member Betz.

1137
01:29:54,724 --> 01:29:55,665
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1138
01:29:56,926 --> 01:30:04,870
[SPEAKER_20]: I did put this resolution on the agenda to further the conversation we had and also to do what we can as a council, I think,

1139
01:30:06,209 --> 01:30:10,731
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, as we know, we've had a lot of discussions about the power of the mayor and the administration recently.

1140
01:30:11,891 --> 01:30:17,853
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's our job to ask what's going on, what's happening, are the commitments that are being made being followed?

1141
01:30:18,154 --> 01:30:19,594
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's the intent of this resolution.

1142
01:30:20,494 --> 01:30:26,217
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think just if I may for a moment, you know, one piece of this is conversations and dialogue.

1143
01:30:26,477 --> 01:30:27,577
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think that's important.

1144
01:30:27,777 --> 01:30:29,418
[SPEAKER_20]: It's important for bringing people together.

1145
01:30:29,838 --> 01:30:31,921
[SPEAKER_20]: It's important for changing hearts and minds.

1146
01:30:32,341 --> 01:30:35,645
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's important for meeting across differences.

1147
01:30:35,725 --> 01:30:37,207
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think there's a lot of value there.

1148
01:30:37,628 --> 01:30:40,251
[SPEAKER_20]: And I do want to know what the administration is doing on that front.

1149
01:30:40,972 --> 01:30:43,174
[SPEAKER_20]: The other piece of this is policy and change.

1150
01:30:44,616 --> 01:30:49,359
[SPEAKER_20]: What are we doing to review city policies to make sure that they don't have disparate impact?

1151
01:30:49,659 --> 01:30:58,664
[SPEAKER_20]: What are we doing to review city ordinances and our city budget to see that we're funding, our funding priorities are meeting the stated verbal priorities that we're putting out there.

1152
01:30:59,105 --> 01:31:08,670
[SPEAKER_20]: What are we doing when it comes to zoning and housing production and environmental justice and climate change to address racial inequities that cross all of those intersections?

1153
01:31:09,311 --> 01:31:13,273
[SPEAKER_20]: So, you know, a piece of this is dialogue and conversation that I think is very, very important.

1154
01:31:13,817 --> 01:31:15,478
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think the other piece is the work of government.

1155
01:31:16,539 --> 01:31:17,439
[SPEAKER_20]: What are our policies?

1156
01:31:17,780 --> 01:31:18,760
[SPEAKER_20]: How are they being reviewed?

1157
01:31:19,341 --> 01:31:23,864
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think some of it as well, we've had some meetings as a council in subcommittee.

1158
01:31:23,904 --> 01:31:26,606
[SPEAKER_20]: We've had discussions in full council.

1159
01:31:27,727 --> 01:31:34,931
[SPEAKER_20]: The mayor's administration facilitated some conversations last year, and that was a good starting point, I think.

1160
01:31:35,252 --> 01:31:36,793
[SPEAKER_20]: But again, it was volunteers.

1161
01:31:36,873 --> 01:31:42,036
[SPEAKER_20]: It was people scrambling to get people to facilitate breakout rooms.

1162
01:31:42,136 --> 01:31:42,757
[SPEAKER_20]: It wasn't like,

1163
01:31:43,297 --> 01:31:46,959
[SPEAKER_20]: we were putting together a full plan and saying, here's how we're going to fund it.

1164
01:31:47,159 --> 01:31:48,720
[SPEAKER_20]: This is the purpose that it's going to seek.

1165
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:51,821
[SPEAKER_20]: So, you know, I think concreteness is important.

1166
01:31:52,261 --> 01:31:54,862
[SPEAKER_20]: I think understanding the outcomes we're trying to achieve is important.

1167
01:31:55,283 --> 01:32:11,090
[SPEAKER_20]: And I especially think that paired with good conversation and dialogue must be the real work of looking into, you know, and I think we all know this as well on many fronts, we have many old policies and old forms and old ways that we do things.

1168
01:32:12,355 --> 01:32:19,827
[SPEAKER_20]: Maybe we need to take a look at some of those I'm not going to lay out any specifics, I want to hear what what's happening I want the administration to report back on what they've been doing.

1169
01:32:20,809 --> 01:32:23,493
[SPEAKER_20]: And I just hope that the answer isn't insufficient.

1170
01:32:23,834 --> 01:32:25,517
[SPEAKER_20]: Maybe it will be maybe it won't be.

1171
01:32:27,461 --> 01:32:31,123
[SPEAKER_20]: We need to know what the administration is doing on policy.

1172
01:32:31,143 --> 01:32:35,445
[SPEAKER_20]: And then I also hope that we as a council will continue to raise these efforts.

1173
01:32:35,505 --> 01:32:40,888
[SPEAKER_20]: And to be honest, I think we have brought this up when it comes to zoning recodification, we've had some good discussions.

1174
01:32:40,928 --> 01:32:46,171
[SPEAKER_20]: When it comes to the marijuana zoning ordinance, we had some good discussions and put some strong equity provisions in there.

1175
01:32:47,071 --> 01:32:49,812
[SPEAKER_20]: We have made some declarations as well.

1176
01:32:50,413 --> 01:32:50,933
[SPEAKER_20]: Is it enough?

1177
01:32:51,593 --> 01:32:54,495
[SPEAKER_20]: I think maybe we need to do more, but you know,

1178
01:32:55,888 --> 01:32:56,769
[SPEAKER_20]: We've taken some steps.

1179
01:32:56,809 --> 01:32:58,712
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to hear what the administration steps are.

1180
01:32:59,313 --> 01:33:09,826
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm very hopeful that in the next round of budget discussions, we will have that more clearly outlined in, in both staffing and programming.

1181
01:33:10,227 --> 01:33:10,567
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1182
01:33:10,748 --> 01:33:11,008
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1183
01:33:12,381 --> 01:33:23,869
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President, I want to thank Councilor Bears for bringing this forward I brought forward a similar resolution, a number of months ago, asking similar questions about the social justice roadmap as I pointed out then and I'd like to point out again.

1184
01:33:23,889 --> 01:33:31,075
[SPEAKER_08]: This roadmap was essentially a retrospective, you know, I appreciate the work that has been done and it was outlined but there was no.

1185
01:33:32,075 --> 01:33:33,776
[SPEAKER_08]: concrete plans for moving forward.

1186
01:33:34,436 --> 01:33:40,919
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think similar to the conversation we were just having, there's a missed opportunity for communication with our community.

1187
01:33:40,939 --> 01:33:50,023
[SPEAKER_08]: I was speaking with a resident recently who asked about the declaration from both the mayor and the council declaring systemic racism, public health crisis.

1188
01:33:50,083 --> 01:33:51,203
[SPEAKER_08]: And they said, what does that do?

1189
01:33:51,764 --> 01:33:54,005
[SPEAKER_08]: And as it was explained to us by the administration,

1190
01:33:55,265 --> 01:34:03,491
[SPEAKER_08]: Having that declaration can unlock certain grant funding to address social determinants of health, and we haven't had an update on that since.

1191
01:34:04,512 --> 01:34:15,160
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure some of the work is going on, but it feels like a real missed opportunity to communicate to our community what this declaration means, what happens as a result of it, what work is going on.

1192
01:34:15,900 --> 01:34:24,082
[SPEAKER_08]: And despairingly, I had a conversation with a resident on Sunday that shared, you know, their father-in-law had a racial slur shouted at them in Medford Square.

1193
01:34:24,462 --> 01:34:28,003
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's, our residents are dealing with this.

1194
01:34:28,603 --> 01:34:42,225
[SPEAKER_08]: They're facing these issues and the least we can get is an update and talk about where we go from here because promises have been made, declarations have been made, and their residents and this council deserve an update about where we go from here.

1195
01:34:42,405 --> 01:34:43,386
[SPEAKER_08]: What work is being done?

1196
01:34:43,586 --> 01:34:44,566
[SPEAKER_08]: How is this being funded?

1197
01:34:45,306 --> 01:34:46,588
[SPEAKER_08]: who's being engaged around this.

1198
01:34:46,808 --> 01:34:52,673
[SPEAKER_08]: So I thank Councilor Beres for bringing this forward and keeping this top of mind and hopefully getting those answers soon.

1199
01:34:53,314 --> 01:34:53,614
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1200
01:34:54,495 --> 01:34:55,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Tocco.

1201
01:34:56,377 --> 01:34:57,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1202
01:34:57,117 --> 01:35:01,862
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to thank Councilor Beres as well and Councilor Morell for her words as well on this topic.

1203
01:35:02,883 --> 01:35:11,690
[SPEAKER_05]: I read through this plan and it actually says this page will be updated regularly as we welcome community feedback and questions.

1204
01:35:11,790 --> 01:35:16,214
[SPEAKER_05]: But when I've gone through, I haven't seen, I haven't noticed any updates.

1205
01:35:17,014 --> 01:35:19,336
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it's important that we do receive an update.

1206
01:35:19,356 --> 01:35:20,717
[SPEAKER_05]: This needs to be a priority.

1207
01:35:20,777 --> 01:35:23,660
[SPEAKER_05]: It's obvious that this needs to be a priority throughout our community.

1208
01:35:24,761 --> 01:35:26,582
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the questions I have is who owns this?

1209
01:35:28,243 --> 01:35:28,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Who owns this plan?

1210
01:35:30,188 --> 01:35:30,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it the mayor's plan?

1211
01:35:30,968 --> 01:35:32,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it diversity and inclusion?

1212
01:35:32,189 --> 01:35:32,729
[SPEAKER_05]: Who owns this?

1213
01:35:32,789 --> 01:35:34,430
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone needs to own this at city hall.

1214
01:35:35,150 --> 01:35:36,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone needs to drive this.

1215
01:35:37,191 --> 01:35:43,873
[SPEAKER_05]: From what I can tell when I read through this, it doesn't look like there's one particular person that owns this.

1216
01:35:44,753 --> 01:35:45,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone needs to own this plan.

1217
01:35:46,034 --> 01:35:47,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone needs to move this forward.

1218
01:35:47,354 --> 01:35:50,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone needs to drive the dialogue and there needs to be dialogue.

1219
01:35:50,956 --> 01:35:51,976
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's lacking.

1220
01:35:53,837 --> 01:35:57,698
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we've had a number of community forums, not nearly enough.

1221
01:35:58,852 --> 01:36:01,874
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we had a handful over the past 12 months.

1222
01:36:01,914 --> 01:36:05,996
[SPEAKER_05]: This came out, I believe a year ago, this coming Thursday.

1223
01:36:06,016 --> 01:36:10,178
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's only been a handful of community forums.

1224
01:36:12,459 --> 01:36:13,719
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to be serious about this.

1225
01:36:14,220 --> 01:36:15,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Money's going to have to go into it.

1226
01:36:16,061 --> 01:36:17,901
[SPEAKER_05]: Dialogue is going, needs to happen.

1227
01:36:17,961 --> 01:36:19,382
[SPEAKER_05]: It needs to happen sooner than later.

1228
01:36:21,683 --> 01:36:23,904
[SPEAKER_05]: I thank Councilor Fierce for bringing this up tonight.

1229
01:36:24,925 --> 01:36:26,025
[SPEAKER_05]: We need, we need an update.

1230
01:36:26,045 --> 01:36:27,326
[SPEAKER_05]: The community needs an update.

1231
01:36:28,439 --> 01:36:33,883
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a roadmap, but we need to do better.

1232
01:36:34,744 --> 01:36:39,447
[SPEAKER_05]: The administration needs to do better on this or else it's a road to nowhere.

1233
01:36:39,507 --> 01:36:46,293
[SPEAKER_05]: So we really need to make sure that this is being discussed on a regular basis and that there is programming built around this on a regular basis.

1234
01:36:47,073 --> 01:36:47,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1235
01:36:48,602 --> 01:36:51,844
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues.

1236
01:36:52,204 --> 01:36:54,706
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to thank councilor beers for putting this on.

1237
01:36:55,566 --> 01:36:58,668
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, you know, we, we voted a while back.

1238
01:36:58,708 --> 01:37:02,830
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's been over a year now to declare racism, a public health crisis in the city.

1239
01:37:03,755 --> 01:37:13,621
[SPEAKER_17]: And I must say, Mr. President, in this past year, I haven't heard from the diversity director at all regarding racism as a public health crisis.

1240
01:37:14,402 --> 01:37:17,564
[SPEAKER_17]: I haven't heard from our Human Rights Commission at all.

1241
01:37:17,784 --> 01:37:18,404
[SPEAKER_17]: I know they meet.

1242
01:37:18,705 --> 01:37:19,945
[SPEAKER_17]: I know they discuss these issues.

1243
01:37:20,526 --> 01:37:22,327
[SPEAKER_17]: They haven't presented before the council.

1244
01:37:22,367 --> 01:37:26,269
[SPEAKER_17]: They haven't raised any concerns to this council, Mr. President.

1245
01:37:26,990 --> 01:37:29,952
[SPEAKER_17]: And secondly, as Councilor Falco mentioned,

1246
01:37:30,532 --> 01:37:38,817
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, it was this council that stood up not too long ago when the mayor said, you know what, we're going to take our diversity director.

1247
01:37:39,678 --> 01:37:43,681
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to make the diversity director, the human resource director as well.

1248
01:37:44,622 --> 01:37:48,204
[SPEAKER_17]: So you had a full-time diversity director.

1249
01:37:48,504 --> 01:37:52,567
[SPEAKER_17]: Now we're going to combine the positions for one person to take on both roles.

1250
01:37:53,047 --> 01:38:01,573
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're also going to ask that diversity director and human resource officer in the community, chief people officer, now, Mr. President,

1251
01:38:02,423 --> 01:38:10,449
[SPEAKER_17]: to also look at all the parking herring violations in the community and be the arbitrator of the parking violations.

1252
01:38:10,849 --> 01:38:12,391
[SPEAKER_17]: This person would have three jobs.

1253
01:38:12,731 --> 01:38:15,913
[SPEAKER_17]: And then you wonder why, when Councilor Falco said, who's leading this?

1254
01:38:16,174 --> 01:38:17,314
[SPEAKER_17]: Who's leading the charge?

1255
01:38:17,675 --> 01:38:18,535
[SPEAKER_17]: You know who's leading it?

1256
01:38:19,056 --> 01:38:20,477
[SPEAKER_17]: Nobody, Mr. President.

1257
01:38:21,854 --> 01:38:24,816
[SPEAKER_17]: because they're taking positions and they're watering them down.

1258
01:38:25,057 --> 01:38:35,325
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's why this council stood up and said the diversity director is far too important of a position to combine the roles and then give other ad hoc responsibilities.

1259
01:38:36,166 --> 01:38:42,271
[SPEAKER_17]: Because we knew, the members of the council knew, if you did that, you'd water down the position.

1260
01:38:43,530 --> 01:38:48,311
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's far too important of an issue, Mr. President, to water down the issue.

1261
01:38:48,631 --> 01:38:49,931
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's what's happening right now.

1262
01:38:50,291 --> 01:38:52,632
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's why we don't have any correspondence.

1263
01:38:52,872 --> 01:38:54,272
[SPEAKER_17]: That's why there's no follow-up.

1264
01:38:54,892 --> 01:38:59,773
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, the buck stops with the mayor, but there's also others in this community, Mr. President.

1265
01:39:00,053 --> 01:39:08,435
[SPEAKER_17]: A commission on human rights, a diversity director, and others, Mr. President, that should be equally as involved pushing the envelope.

1266
01:39:10,179 --> 01:39:13,240
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, we talk about having dialogue in the parks and so forth.

1267
01:39:13,640 --> 01:39:20,541
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what should be happening by the director of diversity, which I haven't heard from in over a year regarding any diversity issues.

1268
01:39:20,921 --> 01:39:21,821
[SPEAKER_17]: Correct me if I'm wrong.

1269
01:39:22,481 --> 01:39:23,081
[SPEAKER_17]: Correct me if I'm wrong.

1270
01:39:23,101 --> 01:39:24,642
[SPEAKER_17]: I haven't heard anything, Mr. President.

1271
01:39:25,222 --> 01:39:29,082
[SPEAKER_17]: And we haven't had any dialogue with the human rights commission.

1272
01:39:29,782 --> 01:39:35,303
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know they mean I've watched their meetings of what I know they're discussing these issues, but guess what?

1273
01:39:35,603 --> 01:39:38,204
[SPEAKER_17]: It's in a vacuum and that's where it stays.

1274
01:39:40,083 --> 01:39:54,215
[SPEAKER_17]: So to have meaningful dialogue, it's great to have these roadmaps and so forth, and you have these round table discussions, and then after that, it kind of dies off, it peters off.

1275
01:39:54,515 --> 01:39:58,599
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's face it, after that, there's no centralized focus on this.

1276
01:39:59,741 --> 01:40:02,642
[SPEAKER_17]: And if we're going to get serious, that's what we need, Mr. President.

1277
01:40:02,943 --> 01:40:07,785
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't need to water down positions and make one person the chief of everything.

1278
01:40:08,405 --> 01:40:11,387
[SPEAKER_17]: And meanwhile, nothing gets done because they're the chief of everything.

1279
01:40:12,427 --> 01:40:13,248
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's what's happening.

1280
01:40:13,628 --> 01:40:14,608
[SPEAKER_17]: It's exactly what's happening.

1281
01:40:14,809 --> 01:40:20,331
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm glad my college stood up and fought not to combine those positions, Mr. President.

1282
01:40:20,731 --> 01:40:21,512
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a tough vote.

1283
01:40:22,759 --> 01:40:23,879
[SPEAKER_17]: because they were trying to sell it.

1284
01:40:24,180 --> 01:40:25,840
[SPEAKER_17]: Geez, look at this.

1285
01:40:25,940 --> 01:40:32,063
[SPEAKER_17]: It's excellent to have the head of diversity as the director of human resources.

1286
01:40:33,183 --> 01:40:40,326
[SPEAKER_17]: It may be a good idea, Mr. President, but we all knew one person that was far too big of a role for one person in this community.

1287
01:40:41,146 --> 01:40:43,687
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm glad we took the stance, to be quite frank with you.

1288
01:40:43,867 --> 01:40:44,748
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1289
01:40:44,788 --> 01:40:45,108
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1290
01:40:47,409 --> 01:40:47,789
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening.

1291
01:40:47,809 --> 01:40:48,829
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address on the record, please.

1292
01:40:49,429 --> 01:40:50,810
[SPEAKER_09]: Jen Lewis, 20 Russell Street.

1293
01:40:52,255 --> 01:41:00,479
[SPEAKER_09]: In response to Councilor Falco's question about whose job is this and whose responsibility, I just need to put out there that it's all about responsibility.

1294
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:02,741
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand, John.

1295
01:41:03,061 --> 01:41:11,365
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to say that it's not, and it's most especially not the responsibility of the people of color in our community to inform us about what's going on.

1296
01:41:12,846 --> 01:41:21,130
[SPEAKER_09]: If you look around, as far as I can tell, there's not a person of color in this room, and there are very few people of color in City Hall.

1297
01:41:21,980 --> 01:41:36,801
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the white people that have primarily power in Medford, and it's us that need to make a difference and need to take the step up and make sure that we are addressing these issues within the white community of Medford, as well.

1298
01:41:38,283 --> 01:41:49,551
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd be very interested to hear from the diversity director to hear if he feels that this, what he thinks is needed to enhance his department.

1299
01:41:50,391 --> 01:42:07,783
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think actually that it is pretty common these days and recommended by diversity directors that that sort of combination of human resources and diversity actually is recommended by a lot of consultants these days in the work that I've done with my nonprofit.

1300
01:42:08,689 --> 01:42:09,614
[SPEAKER_17]: One person doing the job?

1301
01:42:10,686 --> 01:42:12,487
[SPEAKER_09]: it is recommended that it's always fully staffed.

1302
01:42:12,667 --> 01:42:17,631
[SPEAKER_09]: However, if you look around City Hall, there is a lot of places not staffed in City Hall.

1303
01:42:17,671 --> 01:42:19,532
[SPEAKER_17]: We've been in a pandemic, things change.

1304
01:42:19,552 --> 01:42:26,937
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's a big difference, Jen, having it fully staffed and having one role combined, which we know is going to limit that person in that capacity.

1305
01:42:27,537 --> 01:42:28,358
[SPEAKER_17]: That goes without saying.

1306
01:42:28,498 --> 01:42:34,502
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe that there actually is still an opening in that department for that person to not have to do all of the above.

1307
01:42:34,602 --> 01:42:37,103
[SPEAKER_09]: That doesn't mean we can find the right person immediately.

1308
01:42:37,624 --> 01:42:38,484
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks to this council.

1309
01:42:38,504 --> 01:42:39,205
[SPEAKER_17]: You're absolutely right.

1310
01:42:39,676 --> 01:42:45,061
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, if I may, if I may get us back straight quick point of information.

1311
01:42:45,521 --> 01:42:45,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1312
01:42:46,622 --> 01:42:50,626
[SPEAKER_05]: If, if I may just quickly, I just wanted to say, I, Jen, I completely agree.

1313
01:42:50,686 --> 01:42:53,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone needs to own this, but I'm just saying.

1314
01:42:54,963 --> 01:42:56,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody's part of this, yes.

1315
01:42:56,924 --> 01:43:00,907
[SPEAKER_05]: But one person at City Hall needs to own this document.

1316
01:43:01,328 --> 01:43:02,589
[SPEAKER_05]: This needs to be a priority.

1317
01:43:02,689 --> 01:43:16,739
[SPEAKER_05]: We're a city of, I always go back to the metrics and about making sure that these departments are separate because, I go back to the metrics, 59,000 residents, 4,000 kids in the Medford Public Schools, 1,000 municipal employees.

1318
01:43:18,060 --> 01:43:21,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Diversity, inclusion, and equity need to be a priority.

1319
01:43:22,083 --> 01:43:23,644
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why it should be a standalone

1320
01:43:24,380 --> 01:43:24,861
[SPEAKER_05]: department.

1321
01:43:25,001 --> 01:43:26,662
[SPEAKER_05]: We've always had a standalone department.

1322
01:43:28,705 --> 01:43:30,767
[SPEAKER_05]: In my eyes, merging it is going backwards.

1323
01:43:31,087 --> 01:43:33,149
[SPEAKER_05]: You look at other cities and towns.

1324
01:43:33,189 --> 01:43:37,374
[SPEAKER_05]: The city of Lynn just got their first diversity, equity, inclusion office.

1325
01:43:38,315 --> 01:43:39,136
[SPEAKER_05]: They've been waiting forever.

1326
01:43:40,117 --> 01:43:42,900
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had a standalone office for the longest time.

1327
01:43:44,827 --> 01:43:48,129
[SPEAKER_05]: We voted to keep it separate because it needs to be a priority.

1328
01:43:48,790 --> 01:43:57,075
[SPEAKER_05]: And someone at City Hall needs to own this to make sure that we are, you know, the City Hall is accountable for all the deliverables.

1329
01:43:57,115 --> 01:43:57,996
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot in here.

1330
01:43:58,116 --> 01:43:58,996
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 36 pages.

1331
01:43:59,917 --> 01:44:01,378
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's some good stuff in here.

1332
01:44:01,798 --> 01:44:03,539
[SPEAKER_05]: But someone needs to make sure it's getting done.

1333
01:44:03,919 --> 01:44:05,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone needs to make sure there's follow-up.

1334
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:12,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone needs to make sure that there is, you know, programming here on a regular basis and not just, you know, three times a year.

1335
01:44:13,123 --> 01:44:18,970
[SPEAKER_05]: It needs to be a priority, not just a check the box where we have a policy or a roadmap.

1336
01:44:19,731 --> 01:44:21,993
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why I was saying, someone needs to own it.

1337
01:44:22,033 --> 01:44:26,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, everybody needs to own it, but someone needs to be responsible for the document, making sure everything's getting done.

1338
01:44:27,480 --> 01:44:28,060
[SPEAKER_05]: So I agree with you.

1339
01:44:29,272 --> 01:44:35,133
[SPEAKER_09]: as I understand it, the position was originally funded because of a lawsuit against the city for racism issues.

1340
01:44:36,513 --> 01:44:38,854
[SPEAKER_09]: I might be wrong on that, I was told that when I moved to Medford.

1341
01:44:39,574 --> 01:44:51,436
[SPEAKER_09]: And I do believe based on what I've seen in Medford in the 18 years that I've lived here, that that position has never had much authority or much weight in the city.

1342
01:44:51,996 --> 01:44:56,437
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think promoting that person to a higher role in the city can only help.

1343
01:44:56,957 --> 01:45:06,466
[SPEAKER_15]: because it's obviously I certainly disagree with that, but Diane McLeod did yeoman's work on this when it came to diversity and disability issues, especially.

1344
01:45:07,047 --> 01:45:13,053
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, I mean, she would, she'd be in her office with blueprints on restaurants being made and making sure that there were accessible pathways for individuals.

1345
01:45:13,473 --> 01:45:15,215
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, and it was a diversity and disability office.

1346
01:45:15,675 --> 01:45:17,457
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, we've seen the focus of the office change.

1347
01:45:17,978 --> 01:45:21,441
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, we've seen the office actually be proposed to be eliminated.

1348
01:45:22,225 --> 01:45:27,970
[SPEAKER_15]: And that was the priority that this council made, to keep the diversity office alive, because that office was going to be gone entirely.

1349
01:45:28,511 --> 01:45:28,931
[SPEAKER_15]: Entirely.

1350
01:45:28,951 --> 01:45:31,293
[SPEAKER_15]: It was just going to be the office of human resources.

1351
01:45:31,553 --> 01:45:33,795
[SPEAKER_15]: There was not going to be an office of diversity inclusion anymore.

1352
01:45:34,096 --> 01:45:34,756
[SPEAKER_15]: It was going to be gone.

1353
01:45:34,776 --> 01:45:36,538
[SPEAKER_15]: And that was the stand this council took.

1354
01:45:36,998 --> 01:45:48,809
[SPEAKER_15]: We said, there's going to be a circumstance or a situation that comes up where the director of human resources is sitting on an interview panel, say, and an individual that's interviewed feels as though

1355
01:45:49,994 --> 01:46:00,346
[SPEAKER_15]: There was some miss miss malfeasance or what we're giving a fair shake the civil rights of violate whatever it was, who do they go to the human resource officer to just sat on the panel just told them they don't get the job.

1356
01:46:01,297 --> 01:46:02,798
[SPEAKER_15]: That was the conflict that we were talking about.

1357
01:46:02,838 --> 01:46:08,042
[SPEAKER_15]: That was the first sign that we really saw that we need to make a commitment to this.

1358
01:46:08,082 --> 01:46:09,243
[SPEAKER_15]: We can talk all we want to talk.

1359
01:46:09,683 --> 01:46:11,364
[SPEAKER_15]: But at the end of the day, where do we put the money?

1360
01:46:11,444 --> 01:46:12,865
[SPEAKER_15]: We put the money into the diversity office.

1361
01:46:12,885 --> 01:46:15,347
[SPEAKER_15]: We made it a council priority to keep that diversity office alive.

1362
01:46:15,767 --> 01:46:16,488
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's what happened.

1363
01:46:16,848 --> 01:46:22,312
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I think when we look at the steps the administration's taken, we're seeing a lot of press releases.

1364
01:46:22,452 --> 01:46:23,533
[SPEAKER_15]: We're seeing a lot of press releases.

1365
01:46:23,553 --> 01:46:24,674
[SPEAKER_15]: We're seeing a lot of Facebook posts.

1366
01:46:24,694 --> 01:46:26,275
[SPEAKER_15]: But we're seeing a lack of communication.

1367
01:46:26,775 --> 01:46:27,796
[SPEAKER_15]: We're seeing a lack of communication.

1368
01:46:27,816 --> 01:46:29,657
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a communications director that does a great job.

1369
01:46:30,017 --> 01:46:30,798
[SPEAKER_15]: She has a great job.

1370
01:46:30,818 --> 01:46:31,778
[SPEAKER_15]: She puts a great press.

1371
01:46:32,539 --> 01:46:34,980
[SPEAKER_15]: But we need to get in the same room and sit down and talk about some of these things.

1372
01:46:35,901 --> 01:46:38,182
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's not just related to issues of race and equity.

1373
01:46:39,103 --> 01:46:40,764
[SPEAKER_15]: It's related to fiscal responsibility.

1374
01:46:40,784 --> 01:46:42,045
[SPEAKER_15]: It's related to service delivery.

1375
01:46:42,305 --> 01:46:43,986
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a real breakdown in communication.

1376
01:46:45,947 --> 01:46:47,028
[SPEAKER_15]: My father was a great athlete.

1377
01:46:47,068 --> 01:46:50,951
[SPEAKER_15]: He was the athletic director over at the city of Somerville for, I can't tell you, 25 years.

1378
01:46:51,651 --> 01:46:52,932
[SPEAKER_15]: He always talked about athletes.

1379
01:46:53,012 --> 01:46:56,174
[SPEAKER_15]: And he said that an athlete's number one ability is their availability.

1380
01:46:56,556 --> 01:47:08,808
[SPEAKER_15]: If they're not available they can't play, right, if the mayor is not available to take these conversations with us and to come to our meetings when we ask her to be here to address issues of inequity, then how are we supposed to move forward.

1381
01:47:12,401 --> 01:47:13,342
[SPEAKER_15]: How are we supposed to move forward?

1382
01:47:13,362 --> 01:47:18,606
[SPEAKER_15]: We can all stand behind the rail, and we can bang the table, and we can give the good speeches, and we can talk for 20 and 30 and 40 minutes at a time.

1383
01:47:18,646 --> 01:47:22,769
[SPEAKER_15]: Listen, everybody behind this rail can talk, and we can talk the dog off a meat wagon, every single one of us.

1384
01:47:22,789 --> 01:47:24,991
[SPEAKER_15]: You've seen it before, and you'll see it again, right?

1385
01:47:25,031 --> 01:47:26,952
[SPEAKER_15]: But at the end of the day, it's all smoke.

1386
01:47:27,593 --> 01:47:31,796
[SPEAKER_15]: It's all smoke, unless, like Councilor Falco says, someone takes that document.

1387
01:47:32,356 --> 01:47:33,497
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the mayor's roadmap.

1388
01:47:34,118 --> 01:47:35,279
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what it says right on the top of it.

1389
01:47:35,599 --> 01:47:37,000
[SPEAKER_15]: That's who's in charge of that document.

1390
01:47:37,040 --> 01:47:38,201
[SPEAKER_15]: The mayor's in charge of that document.

1391
01:47:38,221 --> 01:47:39,222
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the mayor's roadmap.

1392
01:47:40,117 --> 01:47:44,179
[SPEAKER_15]: The mayor's roadmap, not the council's, not Neil Osborne's, not anybody else's.

1393
01:47:44,199 --> 01:47:45,220
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the mayor's roadmap.

1394
01:47:45,260 --> 01:47:46,300
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's who should be owning this.

1395
01:47:48,822 --> 01:47:49,282
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. President.

1396
01:47:49,542 --> 01:47:53,364
[SPEAKER_15]: In terms of the implementation of public policy and implementation of public policy.

1397
01:47:54,005 --> 01:47:54,785
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1398
01:47:56,266 --> 01:47:58,707
[SPEAKER_20]: My intention with this resolution certainly wasn't to have this argument again.

1399
01:48:00,108 --> 01:48:08,813
[SPEAKER_20]: But, you know, I think regardless, you know, I do want to amend this resolution to ask when

1400
01:48:09,622 --> 01:48:26,498
[SPEAKER_20]: The, if, if it already has been, or when will the diversity director position be posted because I do believe we can have an argument one office two offices we all agree to positions, we certainly agree with that, a full time diversity position and the HR position.

1401
01:48:27,353 --> 01:48:33,356
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, so then where we ended up with two offices and two positions and, you know, that's fine because we have the two positions, right?

1402
01:48:33,796 --> 01:48:40,599
[SPEAKER_20]: So I wasn't to relitigate that specific question, but I haven't seen whether that has been posted.

1403
01:48:40,659 --> 01:48:49,923
[SPEAKER_20]: So my, my amendment is just to request to ask if, or if it has been posted or when it will be posted for the diversity position, I haven't seen it in the list of open city jobs.

1404
01:48:50,283 --> 01:48:55,185
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, so that means we still have, well, I guess now we have nobody doing that job.

1405
01:48:56,365 --> 01:48:59,626
[SPEAKER_20]: Right, because for a while it was, right.

1406
01:48:59,986 --> 01:49:07,488
[SPEAKER_20]: And well, I, you know, at least since the last budget was passed, because, you know, there was a budget that eliminated the position, which I voted against.

1407
01:49:07,528 --> 01:49:09,849
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a budget that restored the position, which I voted for.

1408
01:49:09,889 --> 01:49:14,830
[SPEAKER_20]: But in any case, I would like to just know that answer to that question.

1409
01:49:16,711 --> 01:49:17,611
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'll leave it at that.

1410
01:49:17,671 --> 01:49:23,593
[SPEAKER_20]: But yeah, I think we should look forward at what we can do, not what has happened necessarily.

1411
01:49:24,434 --> 01:49:26,656
[SPEAKER_20]: in the past few months with city budget discussions.

1412
01:49:28,197 --> 01:49:29,778
[SPEAKER_10]: Julianne Otis, 35 Brookings.

1413
01:49:30,999 --> 01:49:42,547
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a long history of being in like evangelical for justice and rights, veterans rights, disabled people's rights, voting rights, LGBTQ, like you name it, I've marched for it.

1414
01:49:43,427 --> 01:49:52,894
[SPEAKER_10]: And what I have discovered in my work in anti-racism in the last few years is that if I can only invite somebody in as far as I've already gone,

1415
01:49:54,326 --> 01:50:10,249
[SPEAKER_10]: So I appreciate that the role and the job and the admirable work of this city council is to both provide support for and ask questions of and put the spurs to this administration.

1416
01:50:11,410 --> 01:50:15,651
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'd like to invite you in to come a little further in your own journey.

1417
01:50:16,431 --> 01:50:18,431
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't say this in a way that's naive.

1418
01:50:18,571 --> 01:50:22,252
[SPEAKER_10]: I say this in a way that I want to point to the efficacy of this kind of work.

1419
01:50:23,032 --> 01:50:40,008
[SPEAKER_10]: because we can talk about dialogue and talk about dialogue and talk about dialogue, but there's something really available that happens when you face your own history and you face your own cultural identity, and you start having conversations about race in your own life with other people.

1420
01:50:40,849 --> 01:50:43,111
[SPEAKER_10]: That looks a lot of different ways for a lot of different people.

1421
01:50:43,391 --> 01:50:48,336
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, just because I've had some formal training, other people just start a conversation over the dinner table.

1422
01:50:49,102 --> 01:50:59,089
[SPEAKER_10]: But I just, I would be remiss if I didn't recommend checking out Born on Third Base, Waking Up White, My Grandmother's Hands.

1423
01:51:01,191 --> 01:51:09,497
[SPEAKER_10]: Lastly, I just want to share that the turning point really happened for me when I was reading Born on Third Base, and I realized how many friends I'd been robbed of.

1424
01:51:10,748 --> 01:51:13,631
[SPEAKER_10]: I grew up in Nebraska, very segregated.

1425
01:51:13,971 --> 01:51:18,335
[SPEAKER_10]: We talk like we're not, but we are.

1426
01:51:18,915 --> 01:51:21,258
[SPEAKER_10]: And I get flashbacks around Medford.

1427
01:51:21,998 --> 01:51:29,605
[SPEAKER_10]: And Shavetta Brown taught me how to blow bubbles with bubble gum when I was six years old.

1428
01:51:29,625 --> 01:51:31,247
[SPEAKER_10]: I used to go to her house all the time.

1429
01:51:32,635 --> 01:51:39,037
[SPEAKER_10]: And around about second grade, third grade, suddenly it was like, oh, no, no, no, no.

1430
01:51:39,137 --> 01:51:43,638
[SPEAKER_10]: All the white kids go over to the other white kids' houses, and all the black kids hang out at the other black kids' houses.

1431
01:51:43,658 --> 01:51:47,899
[SPEAKER_10]: There was never any conversation about it, or this is what you do, or this is what you don't do.

1432
01:51:48,359 --> 01:51:49,199
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just social.

1433
01:51:49,260 --> 01:51:50,380
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just in the water.

1434
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:53,481
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like the fish in the water, and they don't know what they're in.

1435
01:51:54,981 --> 01:51:58,685
[SPEAKER_10]: And I had this moment of realizing that we could have been friends.

1436
01:51:59,465 --> 01:52:01,407
[SPEAKER_10]: She was amazing.

1437
01:52:01,447 --> 01:52:02,848
[SPEAKER_10]: She was my best friend when I was six.

1438
01:52:03,917 --> 01:52:09,901
[SPEAKER_10]: So everybody has their own moment and their own realization about when it actually impacted their own lives.

1439
01:52:10,482 --> 01:52:15,965
[SPEAKER_10]: But until you go there, you can't invite somebody that deep into that dialogue yourself.

1440
01:52:16,326 --> 01:52:30,995
[SPEAKER_10]: So I appreciate that none of what I'm inviting you to is your job, but I'm inviting you in because it's a chance to have a deeper conversation such that you won't feel that this is a chore, that this actually would benefit you personally.

1441
01:52:31,456 --> 01:52:32,216
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you.

1442
01:52:32,376 --> 01:52:32,637
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1443
01:52:33,439 --> 01:52:33,859
[SPEAKER_13]: Sheila.

1444
01:52:34,840 --> 01:52:35,120
[SPEAKER_13]: Sheila.

1445
01:52:35,220 --> 01:52:35,501
[SPEAKER_13]: Sheila.

1446
01:52:35,521 --> 01:52:35,861
[SPEAKER_13]: Sheila.

1447
01:52:36,622 --> 01:52:36,942
[SPEAKER_13]: Sheila.

1448
01:52:36,962 --> 01:52:37,302
[SPEAKER_13]: Sheila.

1449
01:52:37,322 --> 01:52:37,542
[SPEAKER_13]: Sheila.

1450
01:52:37,602 --> 01:52:37,762
[SPEAKER_13]: Sheila.

1451
01:52:37,782 --> 01:52:38,223
[SPEAKER_13]: Sheila.

1452
01:52:38,243 --> 01:52:40,324
[SPEAKER_13]: Sheila.

1453
01:52:40,344 --> 01:52:40,525
[SPEAKER_13]: Sheila.

1454
01:52:40,545 --> 01:52:40,685
[SPEAKER_13]: Sheila.

1455
01:52:40,865 --> 01:52:41,185
[SPEAKER_13]: Sheila.

1456
01:52:41,205 --> 01:52:41,325
[SPEAKER_13]: Sheila.

1457
01:52:41,345 --> 01:52:41,485
[SPEAKER_13]: Sheila.

1458
01:52:41,505 --> 01:52:41,666
[SPEAKER_13]: Sheila.

1459
01:53:01,738 --> 01:53:17,649
[SPEAKER_13]: Sheila, you have to unmute yourself on your side.

1460
01:53:18,750 --> 01:53:19,690
[SPEAKER_12]: Got it, sorry.

1461
01:53:20,571 --> 01:53:21,391
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry about that.

1462
01:53:22,532 --> 01:53:24,113
[SPEAKER_12]: So 19 Sagamore Park.

1463
01:53:25,134 --> 01:53:27,676
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wanted to make a couple of comments.

1464
01:53:28,516 --> 01:53:30,438
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not really sure that

1465
01:53:31,528 --> 01:53:38,091
[SPEAKER_12]: advertising this art installation would have really changed anything with the vandalism.

1466
01:53:38,252 --> 01:53:42,314
[SPEAKER_12]: I truly believe in my heart that it still would have been vandalized.

1467
01:53:46,336 --> 01:54:00,443
[SPEAKER_12]: And I find it very hard to believe that the person that tore, or folks that tore this down didn't live in the neighborhood because as Julianne mentioned, 45 minutes later after she put it up,

1468
01:54:01,055 --> 01:54:04,156
[SPEAKER_12]: they came with box cutters and cut it down.

1469
01:54:04,796 --> 01:54:16,800
[SPEAKER_12]: So to me, I doubt they lived in Somerville or any other adjoining community where they knew 45 minutes later that this was put up.

1470
01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:20,321
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think it's someone who lives very close to the park.

1471
01:54:21,902 --> 01:54:30,485
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it would be, I think going to conversations about racism, you're usually speaking to the choir

1472
01:54:31,617 --> 01:54:34,179
[SPEAKER_12]: having been part of conversation project.

1473
01:54:35,660 --> 01:54:41,164
[SPEAKER_12]: It's usually the people that are the choir that go to these events and these conversations.

1474
01:54:41,945 --> 01:54:59,578
[SPEAKER_12]: I would love to see the young person who got identified to do this, that they would sit down with, you know, a half a dozen people of color, both men and women or boys and girls,

1475
01:55:00,359 --> 01:55:27,963
[SPEAKER_12]: and have a dialogue with them about what their experiences are and how this sort of thing hurts them or racist things being said to them or just general being ignored, whatever is happening that has racist implications because I don't think anything is gonna change in our world no matter what it is

1476
01:55:28,553 --> 01:55:34,937
[SPEAKER_12]: unless people can have empathy for what that other person is experiencing.

1477
01:55:36,198 --> 01:55:43,002
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's what I think would be one of the great things that could come out of this.

1478
01:55:43,122 --> 01:55:49,906
[SPEAKER_12]: And obviously that somehow this kid or kids should pay for the damage that was done.

1479
01:55:49,926 --> 01:55:57,491
[SPEAKER_12]: And maybe it could go into some sort of fund since Julianne was already paid the second time through the crowdsourcing

1480
01:55:58,129 --> 01:56:06,556
[SPEAKER_12]: into some sort of fund that would, I don't know, but anyway, that maybe it could be used for, you know, a positive good.

1481
01:56:07,236 --> 01:56:09,138
[SPEAKER_12]: So those are just my thoughts about it.

1482
01:56:09,218 --> 01:56:18,025
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just obviously incredibly upsetting and I lived on Monument Street and people that know that neighborhood know

1483
01:56:18,678 --> 01:56:21,899
[SPEAKER_12]: It's diverse, used to be much more diverse than it is now.

1484
01:56:22,399 --> 01:56:31,063
[SPEAKER_12]: And one of my neighbors was with her husband crossing High Street in West Medford Square and someone yelled a racial epitaph at them.

1485
01:56:31,763 --> 01:56:40,066
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think it happens every day that we're not aware of it and there is issues in this community.

1486
01:56:41,249 --> 01:56:48,495
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure, I know it happens everywhere, but I know that there's issues in this community because I heard it from one of my neighbors.

1487
01:56:49,416 --> 01:56:51,197
[SPEAKER_12]: So anyway, that's all I have to say.

1488
01:56:51,257 --> 01:56:52,959
[SPEAKER_12]: It's, you know, very disturbing.

1489
01:56:53,579 --> 01:56:59,844
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, there was just a big article about something at UMass Amherst.

1490
01:56:59,924 --> 01:57:08,411
[SPEAKER_12]: And it just, every day you hear something happening that is really, really disturbing in this country, so.

1491
01:57:10,208 --> 01:57:11,669
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, that's all I have to say.

1492
01:57:11,729 --> 01:57:12,209
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1493
01:57:13,029 --> 01:57:13,630
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Sheila.

1494
01:57:14,630 --> 01:57:17,352
[SPEAKER_13]: Kit Collins, name and address of the record, please.

1495
01:57:22,794 --> 01:57:24,455
[SPEAKER_13]: Kit Collins, name and address of the record, please.

1496
01:57:25,436 --> 01:57:25,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1497
01:57:26,096 --> 01:57:28,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, 11 Strathmore Road, number two.

1498
01:57:28,898 --> 01:57:29,798
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Kit Collins.

1499
01:57:29,818 --> 01:57:31,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for the opportunity to speak.

1500
01:57:31,939 --> 01:57:35,401
[SPEAKER_03]: So really grateful that this resolution has been brought up tonight.

1501
01:57:35,521 --> 01:57:37,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for creating the opportunity for

1502
01:57:37,915 --> 01:57:40,256
[SPEAKER_04]: residents and Councilors to speak about it.

1503
01:57:41,677 --> 01:57:54,302
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to echo some of what's already been said before by Councilors and other community members and say that I really feel strongly that conversations are so important.

1504
01:57:54,343 --> 01:58:06,248
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that we need a really discreet programming and funding and concrete channels to continue conversations about race and racism in Medford and white privilege and white supremacy in Medford and how to

1505
01:58:07,183 --> 01:58:10,906
[SPEAKER_04]: systemically unweave those realities.

1506
01:58:11,086 --> 01:58:25,537
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that also, you know, it's so important that we not allow these conversations to get derailed from the focus on addressing structural inequity as it exists in Medford, as it does, you know, in in almost every community across the nation.

1507
01:58:26,418 --> 01:58:33,603
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that we've had some really great outlines of things that we can do to begin to, to address those and to think in those directions.

1508
01:58:33,663 --> 01:58:35,625
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of that some of that thought is already underway.

1509
01:58:36,785 --> 01:58:39,607
[SPEAKER_04]: which, you know, is good, is encouraging.

1510
01:58:40,027 --> 01:58:41,387
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be overdue, but it's good.

1511
01:58:42,668 --> 01:58:55,374
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I think that to say, you know, we've reached the end of our road here because, you know, the buck has stopped somewhere else, you know, just means that we're wasting time.

1512
01:58:55,554 --> 01:58:59,776
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that, like, we must be reflecting on

1513
01:59:01,400 --> 01:59:15,924
[SPEAKER_04]: the spaces that we occupy, especially for people who already hold power in city government, for those who have plenty of spaces in the city where they already feel comfortable and feel comfortable talking about race, which certainly doesn't apply to everybody and doesn't affect people of every race equally.

1514
01:59:17,205 --> 01:59:28,548
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that we have to do the work of looking inward and saying, if there does seem to be a communication breakdown, if we feel like we're not hearing these stories, let's first look at the environment that we're perpetuating and creating.

1515
01:59:28,588 --> 01:59:29,368
[SPEAKER_04]: What can we be doing?

1516
01:59:29,952 --> 01:59:33,054
[SPEAKER_04]: so that we can be receiving this communication?

1517
01:59:33,154 --> 01:59:46,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there things that we could do to make these spaces ones in which everybody can feel comfortable talking about these uncomfortable and sometimes outright dangerous topics?

1518
01:59:47,304 --> 01:59:54,629
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that there's a role for the city council to have in being a really full-throated proponent of anti-racism measures.

1519
01:59:54,729 --> 01:59:59,192
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think lots of constituents would be really eager to see the city council take on

1520
02:00:00,171 --> 02:00:11,881
[SPEAKER_04]: a more bullish approach to advocating for anti-racist dialogue, as well as, you know, as Councilors have said, policies that address structural inequities.

1521
02:00:13,042 --> 02:00:18,647
[SPEAKER_04]: So just to sum up, you know, I agree, we all have the responsibility to start these conversations.

1522
02:00:18,687 --> 02:00:26,894
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that, you know, we need to be creating spaces where people feel, everybody can feel comfortable

1523
02:00:27,912 --> 02:00:28,912
[SPEAKER_04]: talking about these issues.

1524
02:00:29,072 --> 02:00:40,475
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we're observing the fact that we don't yet have perfect communication about these issues, I think that we also have to consider that the fact of white supremacy and racial divide is a reason for that.

1525
02:00:41,075 --> 02:00:42,495
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you for the opportunity.

1526
02:00:43,476 --> 02:00:43,776
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1527
02:00:44,816 --> 02:00:45,756
[SPEAKER_13]: Reverend Wendy Miller.

1528
02:00:46,956 --> 02:00:48,397
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening, Reverend Wendy.

1529
02:00:48,417 --> 02:00:49,617
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address of the record, please.

1530
02:00:53,718 --> 02:00:54,618
[SPEAKER_13]: Hold on, Wendy, one second.

1531
02:00:58,052 --> 02:00:58,772
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1532
02:00:58,792 --> 02:00:59,433
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1533
02:01:00,013 --> 02:01:04,055
[SPEAKER_25]: Wendy Miller will apply day 105 Brooks Street in Medford.

1534
02:01:05,336 --> 02:01:06,937
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you for a moment.

1535
02:01:06,977 --> 02:01:20,465
[SPEAKER_25]: I just want to take one moment to say that I am in strong support of not only inviting the administration to report on progress and action and, you know, improve communication, but

1536
02:01:21,645 --> 02:01:24,787
[SPEAKER_25]: really, you know, all that has already been said.

1537
02:01:25,888 --> 02:01:38,635
[SPEAKER_25]: And that includes a personal plea to each and every one of the members of city council and the school committee and our administrative organization to do their own work.

1538
02:01:38,735 --> 02:01:40,336
[SPEAKER_25]: I think you've been invited into that.

1539
02:01:40,976 --> 02:01:44,018
[SPEAKER_25]: There are models, we don't have to recreate the wheel,

1540
02:01:45,062 --> 02:01:49,765
[SPEAKER_25]: As has already been observed, there are models that we can lean into.

1541
02:01:49,785 --> 02:02:05,834
[SPEAKER_25]: There are community organizations, including Medford Health Matters, that is seeking to both do their own work to understand how the structure, even our bylaws, reflect the kind of white supremacy that we're talking about here.

1542
02:02:07,675 --> 02:02:10,276
[SPEAKER_25]: as are all of our organizations in the city.

1543
02:02:10,617 --> 02:02:25,746
[SPEAKER_25]: So doing our own work individually, organizationally, whether it is in our city government or in nonprofits or in corporate America, the work is being done and the models are already out there.

1544
02:02:25,826 --> 02:02:29,608
[SPEAKER_25]: So all we need to do, my friends, is resource it.

1545
02:02:29,668 --> 02:02:31,049
[SPEAKER_25]: We need to come up with some money

1546
02:02:31,656 --> 02:02:33,056
[SPEAKER_25]: to make these things happen.

1547
02:02:33,796 --> 02:02:41,358
[SPEAKER_25]: I have a model and ready and willing to lead our community through from one perspective.

1548
02:02:41,578 --> 02:02:44,959
[SPEAKER_25]: All I need is about, oh, $25,000 for the next couple of years.

1549
02:02:45,379 --> 02:02:56,081
[SPEAKER_25]: That's the kind of resource we're talking about in order to get the kind of leadership that others have already observed is needed to facilitate the kind of dialogue across difference

1550
02:02:56,701 --> 02:03:18,597
[SPEAKER_25]: that will allow us to create a community where there is no longer hierarchy of human value being celebrated, that we will celebrate all human beings, whether they identify as a particular race, whether they identify as a particular religion or as a particular gender.

1551
02:03:18,637 --> 02:03:20,478
[SPEAKER_25]: We've seen this getting played out.

1552
02:03:20,798 --> 02:03:24,361
[SPEAKER_25]: Now we have a sign in Medford Square that's anti-immigrant.

1553
02:03:25,502 --> 02:03:28,644
[SPEAKER_25]: It is so prevalent in our city.

1554
02:03:28,864 --> 02:03:42,795
[SPEAKER_25]: We all have to take responsibility for fixing this and being a part of shifting, transforming how we express community, how we care for each other, and how we operate as a city.

1555
02:03:42,875 --> 02:03:44,336
[SPEAKER_25]: So thank you for your attention.

1556
02:03:45,277 --> 02:03:48,299
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm signed on to help in whatever ways that I can.

1557
02:03:48,319 --> 02:03:49,360
[SPEAKER_25]: Thanks.

1558
02:03:49,921 --> 02:03:51,822
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Reverend Wendy.

1559
02:03:52,983 --> 02:03:54,004
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address of the record, please.

1560
02:03:57,196 --> 02:03:59,638
[SPEAKER_19]: William Navarre, 108 Medford Street, number 1B.

1561
02:04:00,198 --> 02:04:04,522
[SPEAKER_19]: I just wanted to thank the city council for putting this forward and keeping up on this issue.

1562
02:04:05,062 --> 02:04:05,823
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a tough issue.

1563
02:04:05,883 --> 02:04:10,187
[SPEAKER_19]: Some days you put it on the city council agenda and you get a lot of people very angry at you.

1564
02:04:10,807 --> 02:04:13,169
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's one difficulty you have.

1565
02:04:13,569 --> 02:04:19,074
[SPEAKER_19]: And other times you do this and you feel like you're just banging your head against the wall.

1566
02:04:19,094 --> 02:04:20,095
[SPEAKER_19]: You're not making any progress.

1567
02:04:22,747 --> 02:04:25,729
[SPEAKER_19]: drags on and on, and you got to just keep up on it.

1568
02:04:25,769 --> 02:04:31,174
[SPEAKER_19]: It's very easy for somebody to pass a resolution and then forget about it.

1569
02:04:31,194 --> 02:04:36,298
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's really tough to remember to keep coming back to it, put up with people who are very angry about that.

1570
02:04:36,959 --> 02:04:38,200
[SPEAKER_19]: And it just causes a lot of trouble.

1571
02:04:38,520 --> 02:04:41,443
[SPEAKER_19]: And so I really thank you guys for keeping up on this important issue.

1572
02:04:41,463 --> 02:04:41,763
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1573
02:04:42,123 --> 02:04:42,624
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1574
02:04:42,864 --> 02:04:47,348
[SPEAKER_13]: So on the motion by Councilor Bears, as amended by Councilor Bears, seconded by?

1575
02:04:47,548 --> 02:04:47,808
[SPEAKER_13]: Second.

1576
02:04:48,309 --> 02:04:49,530
[SPEAKER_13]: Seconded by Councilor Falco.

1577
02:04:51,912 --> 02:04:52,692
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

1578
02:04:53,552 --> 02:04:53,652
Aye.

1579
02:04:55,013 --> 02:04:56,953
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Bears has requested a roll call vote.

1580
02:04:56,973 --> 02:05:00,133
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Clerk, can you read the full motion, please?

1581
02:05:02,434 --> 02:05:04,314
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Clerk, can you read that back?

1582
02:05:04,394 --> 02:05:04,854
[SPEAKER_13]: One second.

1583
02:05:12,716 --> 02:05:17,576
[SPEAKER_13]: If I understood it, Councilor Bears has requested... That's the clerk reading it.

1584
02:05:18,497 --> 02:05:20,617
[SPEAKER_18]: You want the full resolution plus the amendment, right?

1585
02:05:22,639 --> 02:05:32,021
[SPEAKER_18]: Be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the city administration report to the council on anti-racism efforts and trainings conducted under the mayor's social justice roadmap.

1586
02:05:32,621 --> 02:05:47,165
[SPEAKER_18]: Be it further resolved that the city administration provide an update on future plans for funding anti-racism programs and public programming to involve all Medford residents in dismantling systems and structures to perpetuate white supremacy and racial inequity.

1587
02:05:47,565 --> 02:05:51,026
[SPEAKER_18]: And that council mayors offer an amendment requesting if and when will be

1588
02:05:51,719 --> 02:05:53,781
[SPEAKER_18]: diversity director position be posted.

1589
02:05:55,342 --> 02:05:55,562
[SPEAKER_13]: 100% correct.

1590
02:05:55,582 --> 02:05:56,943
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for your accuracy.

1591
02:05:57,003 --> 02:05:58,004
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1592
02:05:58,064 --> 02:05:58,324
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1593
02:05:58,344 --> 02:05:58,404
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1594
02:05:58,424 --> 02:05:58,564
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1595
02:05:58,584 --> 02:05:58,644
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1596
02:06:14,124 --> 02:06:18,188
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, six affirmative, one absent, motion passes.

1597
02:06:18,208 --> 02:06:19,789
[SPEAKER_13]: 21558, offered by Councilor Falco.

1598
02:06:20,309 --> 02:06:30,899
[SPEAKER_13]: Be it resolved that the city administration provide Medford City Council with an update as to the future of the city-owned property at 15 Maple Park Avenue.

1599
02:06:31,039 --> 02:06:31,799
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Falco.

1600
02:06:32,120 --> 02:06:33,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1601
02:06:34,001 --> 02:06:39,166
[SPEAKER_05]: This here is the property at 15 Maple Park Avenue, the former Bridgewell

1602
02:06:39,656 --> 02:06:42,400
[SPEAKER_05]: building and the heckner center going back years ago.

1603
02:06:42,420 --> 02:06:45,065
[SPEAKER_05]: It's city owns a property.

1604
02:06:45,846 --> 02:06:46,407
[SPEAKER_05]: The property

1605
02:06:49,262 --> 02:06:53,885
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll say it hasn't really been maintained that well.

1606
02:06:54,265 --> 02:06:58,927
[SPEAKER_05]: During the summer, the weeds are five, six feet tall.

1607
02:06:59,528 --> 02:07:03,590
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks from the outside like it's in some sort of maybe disrepair.

1608
02:07:03,610 --> 02:07:04,710
[SPEAKER_05]: I have not been inside.

1609
02:07:04,731 --> 02:07:07,892
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe the police may be using it for training occasionally.

1610
02:07:08,432 --> 02:07:11,354
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that there's been vehicles parked inside.

1611
02:07:11,374 --> 02:07:15,736
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they are maybe former police vehicles, but

1612
02:07:18,767 --> 02:07:22,168
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an enablement and the city needs to keep up the property.

1613
02:07:22,188 --> 02:07:28,690
[SPEAKER_05]: I've also been hearing from residents that there's rodents around the area as well.

1614
02:07:29,151 --> 02:07:30,651
[SPEAKER_05]: And this year needs to be addressed.

1615
02:07:31,611 --> 02:07:38,774
[SPEAKER_05]: And the city really hasn't made a statement about what's going to happen with this property, what's the future of this property.

1616
02:07:39,134 --> 02:07:42,755
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a vacant for a number of years now and it really needs to be addressed.

1617
02:07:43,195 --> 02:07:52,959
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm bringing the resolution forward to just get an update from the administration as to what the plans are for the property and to also just make sure that it's maintained on a regular basis.

1618
02:07:53,299 --> 02:07:54,440
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, it's in a neighborhood.

1619
02:07:55,240 --> 02:07:59,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Neighbors should not have to look at something that is overgrown every few weeks.

1620
02:07:59,142 --> 02:08:00,502
[SPEAKER_05]: It should be on a maintenance schedule.

1621
02:08:01,303 --> 02:08:05,945
[SPEAKER_05]: In a previous resolution I had regarding this, I asked for the maintenance schedule with regard to this property.

1622
02:08:06,585 --> 02:08:07,846
[SPEAKER_05]: I have not received one yet.

1623
02:08:07,886 --> 02:08:15,409
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm hoping that I'll receive one at some point, but I just want to, tonight, this resolution is just basically to find out what are the plans for this building?

1624
02:08:15,750 --> 02:08:22,293
[SPEAKER_05]: And at one point in time, I think it was maybe being considered as an art center, but I'm not sure if any progress has been made in that area.

1625
02:08:22,653 --> 02:08:27,696
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that there is one resident, I believe, that wants to speak on this tonight, but thank you.

1626
02:08:28,696 --> 02:08:29,416
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening, Cindy.

1627
02:08:29,436 --> 02:08:30,477
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address of the record, please.

1628
02:08:31,017 --> 02:08:31,658
[SPEAKER_24]: Hello there, Rick.

1629
02:08:32,278 --> 02:08:34,159
[SPEAKER_24]: Cindy Watson, 65 Valley Street.

1630
02:08:36,164 --> 02:08:46,250
[SPEAKER_24]: John, you were being more than polite in bringing this up, but to say that it is in somewhat of a disrepair is, it couldn't be further from the truth.

1631
02:08:47,711 --> 02:08:50,373
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, they're doing an Adams family rerun.

1632
02:08:50,813 --> 02:08:54,115
[SPEAKER_24]: They should have filmed it here, okay?

1633
02:08:54,375 --> 02:08:55,316
[SPEAKER_24]: It is atrocious.

1634
02:08:55,756 --> 02:09:02,401
[SPEAKER_24]: Several years ago, Mark Rumley, of his own volition, former city solicitor, came and spoke for about an hour

1635
02:09:03,041 --> 02:09:04,403
[SPEAKER_24]: to the folks at Maple Park.

1636
02:09:04,924 --> 02:09:05,785
[SPEAKER_24]: I live at Maple Park.

1637
02:09:05,825 --> 02:09:07,708
[SPEAKER_24]: There are 44 unit owners in there.

1638
02:09:07,848 --> 02:09:11,072
[SPEAKER_24]: We all have a beneficial interest in what goes on in this city.

1639
02:09:12,074 --> 02:09:19,424
[SPEAKER_24]: 22 face the Felsway, 22 face Boston, which overlooks this property, which is horrific.

1640
02:09:21,522 --> 02:09:27,944
[SPEAKER_24]: One of the women who just died was a catalyst in trying to get that converted into an art center.

1641
02:09:28,424 --> 02:09:39,247
[SPEAKER_24]: I can tell you that Michael Marx spent months and months and months trying to pursue that as an opportunity to house artisans within Medford.

1642
02:09:40,527 --> 02:09:42,148
[SPEAKER_24]: It was no longer a viable option.

1643
02:09:42,828 --> 02:09:44,749
[SPEAKER_24]: Again, it's a disgrace.

1644
02:09:46,824 --> 02:09:54,238
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't wanna minimize the former gentleman that came forward to say that granite versus concrete, it's terrible for the property values.

1645
02:09:54,959 --> 02:09:57,964
[SPEAKER_24]: People paying a half a million dollars now to be in Maple Park.

1646
02:09:59,383 --> 02:10:00,283
[SPEAKER_24]: We overlooked that.

1647
02:10:00,743 --> 02:10:02,084
[SPEAKER_24]: I have to see it every single day.

1648
02:10:02,644 --> 02:10:16,267
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a little bit sort of hits home to me because I spent my career providing services at various facilities in Massachusetts as well as going across the country.

1649
02:10:16,567 --> 02:10:18,968
[SPEAKER_24]: We were the counterpart of JCO, which evaluates

1650
02:10:19,488 --> 02:10:24,892
[SPEAKER_24]: hospital administrations to make sure facilities that served people with disabilities were in compliance.

1651
02:10:25,312 --> 02:10:29,775
[SPEAKER_24]: I can tell you right now, if a cough survey came out, that place would be shut down.

1652
02:10:30,856 --> 02:10:38,441
[SPEAKER_24]: And it's a terrible, terrible blemish on the city that that building continues to be in the shape that it's in.

1653
02:10:38,682 --> 02:10:40,483
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know why the Bridgewell sign is still up.

1654
02:10:41,083 --> 02:10:43,165
[SPEAKER_24]: The roof looks like it's ready to collapse any minute.

1655
02:10:43,945 --> 02:10:45,346
[SPEAKER_24]: There's rodents coming in and out.

1656
02:10:45,927 --> 02:10:47,468
[SPEAKER_24]: The weeds are as tall as I am.

1657
02:10:47,828 --> 02:10:49,049
[SPEAKER_24]: You can't even see the building.

1658
02:10:50,534 --> 02:10:52,875
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a lawsuit waiting to happen.

1659
02:10:54,435 --> 02:11:02,058
[SPEAKER_24]: Oftentimes I'll sit there and kids will jump over the fence, try to go into the unmarked police cars to break in.

1660
02:11:02,878 --> 02:11:05,539
[SPEAKER_24]: And not only that, they go in and try to get into the building.

1661
02:11:06,279 --> 02:11:08,800
[SPEAKER_24]: So this has been going on far, far too long.

1662
02:11:10,060 --> 02:11:15,022
[SPEAKER_24]: So when is the city going to do something about the state of affairs in this building?

1663
02:11:22,451 --> 02:11:28,395
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is a great question and that's part of the purpose of this resolution to find out what are the plans, are there any plans?

1664
02:11:28,896 --> 02:11:37,682
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, as I said earlier, Councilor Marks had led the effort for years on an art studio there, but we haven't really received an update in quite some time.

1665
02:11:37,762 --> 02:11:47,249
[SPEAKER_05]: So really the purpose of the resolution is to receive an update to find out what the plans are because we haven't received any updates in quite some time.

1666
02:11:49,164 --> 02:11:50,125
[SPEAKER_24]: It's been going on for years.

1667
02:11:50,605 --> 02:11:53,047
[SPEAKER_24]: I guess the best solution right now, Halloween's coming around.

1668
02:11:53,207 --> 02:11:57,349
[SPEAKER_24]: Maybe we could charge admission for people to come and look at a haunted house.

1669
02:11:58,170 --> 02:11:58,630
[SPEAKER_24]: It's bad.

1670
02:11:59,351 --> 02:12:00,411
[SPEAKER_24]: It's, it's beyond bad.

1671
02:12:01,332 --> 02:12:02,833
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President.

1672
02:12:04,054 --> 02:12:05,034
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1673
02:12:05,054 --> 02:12:07,636
[SPEAKER_17]: And I want to thank Cindy Watson for coming up.

1674
02:12:08,036 --> 02:12:10,898
[SPEAKER_17]: It's been a long time resident of this community and

1675
02:12:11,437 --> 02:12:21,941
[SPEAKER_17]: an advocate on a lot of issues, including Chevalier Auditorium, and I thank you for the friends of Chevalier and all you've done, your efforts, and I appreciate that.

1676
02:12:22,621 --> 02:12:29,643
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, it was back probably now close to three years ago that I was approached by a number of artists in the community.

1677
02:12:30,383 --> 02:12:31,464
[SPEAKER_17]: They knew back some

1678
02:12:32,544 --> 02:12:40,908
[SPEAKER_17]: 10, 12 years ago, I sat on the vision committee to make the Swan School an art center.

1679
02:12:41,648 --> 02:12:47,010
[SPEAKER_17]: And as you probably remember, Cindy, back then, it lost the vote of this council by one vote.

1680
02:12:47,490 --> 02:12:52,953
[SPEAKER_17]: We almost had an art center coupled with local public access at the Swan School.

1681
02:12:53,693 --> 02:13:01,856
[SPEAKER_17]: And that was very traumatic for many of the artists that put countless hours and time into that, making that building an art center, which we all know is needed.

1682
02:13:02,256 --> 02:13:04,617
[SPEAKER_17]: So about three years ago, I was approached by some of the artists.

1683
02:13:05,018 --> 02:13:06,478
[SPEAKER_17]: I formed a group, Mr. President.

1684
02:13:06,818 --> 02:13:13,981
[SPEAKER_17]: We actually met on a rather monthly, every couple of months basis at Maple Park Condominiums.

1685
02:13:14,641 --> 02:13:16,842
[SPEAKER_17]: It was comprised of a number of artists in the community.

1686
02:13:17,583 --> 02:13:18,583
[SPEAKER_17]: We did look at

1687
02:13:19,784 --> 02:13:23,367
[SPEAKER_17]: the old Hegner Center as a potential art center.

1688
02:13:23,868 --> 02:13:29,694
[SPEAKER_17]: We had architects come in to look at the building and what the cost would be to refurbish that into an art center.

1689
02:13:30,054 --> 02:13:37,942
[SPEAKER_17]: We were talking about having public art classes at no cost for Meffitt residents, small art studios there, and have a full-fledged art center.

1690
02:13:39,203 --> 02:13:48,488
[SPEAKER_17]: And over the past three years, Mayor Burke was, I'd say, on board and committed to leaving that building open for us.

1691
02:13:49,348 --> 02:13:54,771
[SPEAKER_17]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn was committed to leaving that building open to us over the years.

1692
02:13:54,811 --> 02:13:57,653
[SPEAKER_17]: We've asked for it to be trimmed, which they have.

1693
02:13:58,093 --> 02:14:00,075
[SPEAKER_17]: I know personally, I dealt with Paul Moki.

1694
02:14:00,475 --> 02:14:05,679
[SPEAKER_17]: We had the roof showed up because it was raining inside the building, to be quite honest with you.

1695
02:14:06,199 --> 02:14:13,904
[SPEAKER_17]: And we were concerned that we would get a building for the art center that was in such deplorable condition that it was going to be cost prohibitive for the artist.

1696
02:14:14,365 --> 02:14:16,206
[SPEAKER_17]: So we asked that the roof be showed up.

1697
02:14:17,847 --> 02:14:21,370
[SPEAKER_17]: And over time, Mr. President, I think there's been countless resolutions by each member

1698
02:14:21,850 --> 02:14:25,473
[SPEAKER_17]: of this council to make sure that that building is at least kept up.

1699
02:14:26,955 --> 02:14:29,377
[SPEAKER_17]: There is a group that uses that building.

1700
02:14:29,737 --> 02:14:35,262
[SPEAKER_17]: We've all got calls regarding the organization.

1701
02:14:35,422 --> 02:14:35,922
[SPEAKER_17]: What is it?

1702
02:14:37,675 --> 02:14:45,903
[SPEAKER_17]: the middle six, that uses that building, the city allows them to use the building for training purposes.

1703
02:14:46,343 --> 02:14:52,109
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's police officers from all these surrounding communities go in there and use that building for training services.

1704
02:14:53,450 --> 02:15:00,936
[SPEAKER_17]: because a number of residents in your building saw police going in there all the time and thought something was happening, but they're using it for training purpose.

1705
02:15:01,177 --> 02:15:17,231
[SPEAKER_17]: But needless to say, to make this story short, because it's getting late, the group that I formed back some couple of years ago, we now have the possibility of another building in the community that may be rent-free,

1706
02:15:18,672 --> 02:15:25,375
[SPEAKER_17]: more parking, larger space, and a real suit for the art community for an art center.

1707
02:15:25,815 --> 02:15:33,299
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's been our focus for the last probably close to a year, and it's been taken away from the Hegner Center.

1708
02:15:33,339 --> 02:15:40,963
[SPEAKER_17]: So I would, it's fair to say that whatever's being done in that building right now is not involved with looking at a new art center.

1709
02:15:41,583 --> 02:15:42,364
[SPEAKER_17]: for the time being.

1710
02:15:43,084 --> 02:15:46,826
[SPEAKER_17]: And I would agree that that building something needs to happen.

1711
02:15:47,506 --> 02:15:49,567
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, we saved the building.

1712
02:15:49,927 --> 02:15:53,909
[SPEAKER_17]: If members of this council remember the mayor, Mayor Burke, try to sell that building off.

1713
02:15:54,129 --> 02:15:57,371
[SPEAKER_13]: It was my motion that they would try to sell for a dollar.

1714
02:15:57,611 --> 02:15:59,214
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, they were trying to get rid of that building.

1715
02:15:59,234 --> 02:16:12,374
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, this council saved the building, the deeds at the registry deed stated if there was no longer being used for that purpose of providing social services for the impaired, Mr. President, that

1716
02:16:12,994 --> 02:16:14,295
[SPEAKER_17]: it would revert back to the city.

1717
02:16:14,315 --> 02:16:15,696
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a little-known document.

1718
02:16:15,956 --> 02:16:17,937
[SPEAKER_17]: The building ended up being reverted back to us.

1719
02:16:18,357 --> 02:16:22,000
[SPEAKER_17]: It's worth $600,000 or $700,000, I believe the assessed value is.

1720
02:16:22,700 --> 02:16:27,543
[SPEAKER_17]: And indeed, it's a building that we should take care of, even if we don't have plans for it.

1721
02:16:28,003 --> 02:16:37,249
[SPEAKER_17]: As Cindy stated, it's across, it's in a neighborhood, it's across from the condominiums over there that keep excellent care of their property.

1722
02:16:38,139 --> 02:16:39,259
[SPEAKER_17]: in their property values.

1723
02:16:39,879 --> 02:16:53,603
[SPEAKER_17]: And I would go along with Councilor Falco that we ask immediately that whatever roof repairs, temporary roof repairs need to be done and work around the building be done immediately in the interest of public safety.

1724
02:16:54,023 --> 02:16:54,783
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1725
02:16:55,203 --> 02:17:04,385
[SPEAKER_13]: So on the motion, on the motion by Councilor, oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Cassinetti, name and address of the record, please.

1726
02:17:10,040 --> 02:17:12,502
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello.

1727
02:17:13,863 --> 02:17:14,283
[SPEAKER_23]: Hello.

1728
02:17:15,224 --> 02:17:23,069
[SPEAKER_23]: Hello, have my hands up for about 510 minutes I was going to say something about this last resolution about the race.

1729
02:17:25,531 --> 02:17:29,994
[SPEAKER_13]: We're talking about the, the old head of the Senate Andrew.

1730
02:17:30,547 --> 02:17:43,593
[SPEAKER_23]: Right, so I simply wanted to say before, I believe there's good and bad in every race, creed, and religion, and I believe Martin Luther King had the right idea, we should judge man or woman by their character.

1731
02:17:43,933 --> 02:17:46,134
[SPEAKER_23]: Now, onto the subject at hand.

1732
02:17:46,554 --> 02:17:50,396
[SPEAKER_23]: Councilor Marks is right on, as usual.

1733
02:17:51,256 --> 02:17:57,479
[SPEAKER_23]: I remember when the previous mayor was gonna sell her for a song, a cheap song at that,

1734
02:17:58,234 --> 02:18:02,937
[SPEAKER_23]: and I think believe Council Marks and Caraviello was saving it for the people.

1735
02:18:03,978 --> 02:18:19,810
[SPEAKER_23]: And Council Marks is always also right about when the three to three vote for the Swan School was the deciding dagger in the table was by Councilor Muccini-Burke at that time.

1736
02:18:20,270 --> 02:18:27,075
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's why we lost the vote four to three to get the Swan School for the TB3 and methadoxinitis and the,

1737
02:18:28,922 --> 02:18:30,123
[SPEAKER_23]: Method Arts Council.

1738
02:18:30,563 --> 02:18:33,585
[SPEAKER_23]: Council March has been right on for over two decades.

1739
02:18:34,425 --> 02:18:42,250
[SPEAKER_23]: Anyways, maybe this opportunity for the artists might come somewhere else, it seems to me in my gut feeling.

1740
02:18:42,950 --> 02:18:45,912
[SPEAKER_23]: So maybe this would, it is cost prohibitive

1741
02:18:46,548 --> 02:18:58,034
[SPEAKER_23]: and maybe you people should just sell it our city building to a developer dependent on the square footage and just demolish it and make more hopefully affordable housing.

1742
02:18:58,394 --> 02:18:59,495
[SPEAKER_23]: I have no further comments.

1743
02:19:00,715 --> 02:19:01,556
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. Castagnetti.

1744
02:19:02,416 --> 02:19:06,718
[SPEAKER_13]: So on the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Locks.

1745
02:19:07,719 --> 02:19:08,419
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

[SPEAKER_13]: 21562 offered by Vice President Knight.

1757
02:19:37,652 --> 02:19:37,712
[SPEAKER_13]: 75th.

1758
02:19:48,936 --> 02:19:49,816
[SPEAKER_13]: Congratulations, Larry.

1759
02:19:53,037 --> 02:19:57,558
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Vice President Naif, seconded by Councilor Falco.

1760
02:19:57,578 --> 02:20:07,741
[SPEAKER_15]: We're not going to talk about all the service to the community, the housing authority, the city council, United States of America as a veteran, 75 years in this wonderful city, a West Medford guy over here.

1761
02:20:07,761 --> 02:20:08,161
[SPEAKER_15]: Come on.

1762
02:20:08,441 --> 02:20:10,922
[SPEAKER_15]: We got to give him a little bit of kudos on his birthday, Mr. President.

1763
02:20:10,942 --> 02:20:11,962
[SPEAKER_20]: The king of Paris Street.

1764
02:20:14,943 --> 02:20:16,003
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Larry, for your service.

1765
02:20:16,023 --> 02:20:16,663
[SPEAKER_13]: Happy birthday, brother.

1766
02:20:17,625 --> 02:20:21,688
[SPEAKER_13]: Now on the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco, all those in favor?

1767
02:20:22,089 --> 02:20:22,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1768
02:20:22,269 --> 02:20:23,310
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

1769
02:20:23,770 --> 02:20:24,731
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

1770
02:20:27,495 --> 02:20:52,603
[SPEAKER_13]: 21563 offered by Vice President Knight being so resolved that the Medford City Council thank Board Members General Richard Lasky and Judith Murray for their service as members of the Board of Registrar Voters in the elections in the City of Medford and be it further resolved that the Medford City Council present these individuals each with a council citation recognizing their service to the residents of the City of Medford.

1771
02:20:53,305 --> 02:20:54,506
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice President Knight.

1772
02:20:54,546 --> 02:20:55,626
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1773
02:20:55,887 --> 02:20:57,147
[SPEAKER_15]: Both Ms.

1774
02:20:57,367 --> 02:20:58,908
[SPEAKER_15]: General Lasky and Ms.

1775
02:20:58,928 --> 02:21:03,691
[SPEAKER_15]: Murray have served on the Board of Registrars for an extended period of time, as long as I can remember.

1776
02:21:04,212 --> 02:21:05,893
[SPEAKER_15]: They've both served this city diligently.

1777
02:21:06,253 --> 02:21:16,359
[SPEAKER_15]: They've done a great job working with our election staff to ensure that our elections roll out smoothly, to ensure that our elections policy is fair and equitable, and to be sure that

1778
02:21:16,940 --> 02:21:24,906
[SPEAKER_15]: We get the job done when it comes down to one of the most important functions of city government, which is conducting municipal and state elections.

1779
02:21:25,807 --> 02:21:30,551
[SPEAKER_15]: So both members of the board have sought retirement after this recent primary election.

1780
02:21:31,252 --> 02:21:36,616
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that it's only warranted.

1781
02:21:37,096 --> 02:21:44,382
[SPEAKER_15]: So I bring forward this resolution, Mr. President, congratulating them for their service and dedication to the community and ask them to council colleagues support the resolve.

1782
02:21:46,164 --> 02:21:46,484
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1783
02:21:47,574 --> 02:21:48,215
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Talco.

1784
02:21:49,416 --> 02:21:54,139
[SPEAKER_05]: And I thank Councilor Knight for bringing this forward and share his sentiments as well.

1785
02:21:54,159 --> 02:22:06,550
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to congratulate and thank General Lasky and Judith Murray for their many years of service to our community and wish them well.

1786
02:22:06,770 --> 02:22:07,150
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1787
02:22:07,330 --> 02:22:07,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1788
02:22:08,390 --> 02:22:09,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks.

1789
02:22:09,711 --> 02:22:10,511
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1790
02:22:10,531 --> 02:22:14,433
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to thank Vice President Knight for putting this on.

1791
02:22:15,174 --> 02:22:26,180
[SPEAKER_17]: In all the years that I've had in this committee, Mr. President, you never heard anyone once say that all the elections are not fair, or the elections are this, or the elections are that.

1792
02:22:26,880 --> 02:22:40,426
[SPEAKER_17]: General Lasky, Judith Murray have run the elections in this community, along with the staff, Mr. President, in a way that gives us the trust and confidence that we're running elections, Mr. President, in the manner that they should be.

1793
02:22:41,086 --> 02:22:44,028
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just want to thank them both for their many, many years of service.

1794
02:22:44,468 --> 02:22:51,591
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a thankless job, Mr. President, especially on election day, as the clerk can attest to, Mr. President.

1795
02:22:52,091 --> 02:22:56,213
[SPEAKER_17]: And I want to thank them both for their many years of dedicated service.

1796
02:22:56,886 --> 02:22:57,146
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1797
02:22:58,608 --> 02:23:02,151
[SPEAKER_13]: So on the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Marks.

1798
02:23:03,332 --> 02:23:04,012
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

1799
02:23:04,353 --> 02:23:04,453
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

1800
02:23:04,873 --> 02:23:05,394
[SPEAKER_13]: All opposed?

1801
02:23:05,474 --> 02:23:06,294
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

1802
02:23:06,535 --> 02:23:08,296
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. President, point of personal privilege, if I may.

1803
02:23:08,556 --> 02:23:09,397
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, Councilman.

1804
02:23:09,537 --> 02:23:12,500
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sorry to do this to everyone at the end of the meeting, but I'm a little sorry.

1805
02:23:14,121 --> 02:23:16,984
[SPEAKER_20]: I just want to make a quick statement, if you'll indulge me.

1806
02:23:17,344 --> 02:23:19,707
[SPEAKER_20]: This is just on reference to something I said last week.

1807
02:23:21,684 --> 02:23:26,207
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, the word totalitarianism was brought up to describe our form of government.

1808
02:23:26,647 --> 02:23:31,850
[SPEAKER_20]: And I made a comment that this is democracy.

1809
02:23:32,511 --> 02:23:38,715
[SPEAKER_20]: And I just would like to clarify, because there's been some commentary and speculation about what I was saying, that I was talking about the election.

1810
02:23:38,735 --> 02:23:41,577
[SPEAKER_20]: I was talking about who I'm supporting in the local election.

1811
02:23:41,597 --> 02:23:42,957
[SPEAKER_20]: And I just want to make a quick point.

1812
02:23:42,997 --> 02:23:50,102
[SPEAKER_20]: It actually relates exactly to what General Elasky and Judy Murray have been doing for several decades in this community, which is

1813
02:23:51,192 --> 02:23:58,060
[SPEAKER_20]: about democracy and the fact that we're blessed in our country and in our city to have a government of, for, and by the people.

1814
02:23:58,912 --> 02:24:00,893
[SPEAKER_20]: that we elect our leaders by majority vote.

1815
02:24:01,213 --> 02:24:02,674
[SPEAKER_20]: And if we like them, we can keep them.

1816
02:24:03,155 --> 02:24:05,096
[SPEAKER_20]: And if we don't, we can elect somebody else.

1817
02:24:06,176 --> 02:24:13,821
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, we've seen a lot of people on television and online making statements and lying to undermine our democratic process.

1818
02:24:14,822 --> 02:24:17,763
[SPEAKER_20]: And, you know, occasionally people bring those lies into this room.

1819
02:24:18,464 --> 02:24:22,606
[SPEAKER_20]: They throw around words like totalitarianism to describe our democratic process.

1820
02:24:23,347 --> 02:24:25,048
[SPEAKER_20]: And it more than frustrates me.

1821
02:24:25,708 --> 02:24:27,209
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know what that beeping is, but

1822
02:24:40,711 --> 02:24:43,492
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, I'm gonna wait, or if you take it out of the room, thank you.

1823
02:24:43,512 --> 02:24:51,055
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you want you to answer for him?

1824
02:24:51,495 --> 02:24:52,276
[SPEAKER_17]: Press stop.

1825
02:25:06,922 --> 02:25:09,062
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there a button on it?

1826
02:25:09,142 --> 02:25:10,543
[SPEAKER_18]: I think somebody realized that he

1827
02:25:19,421 --> 02:25:22,164
[SPEAKER_18]: put it in the icebox please Wow thank you sorry my

1828
02:25:32,452 --> 02:25:33,873
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't have to start over.

1829
02:25:33,933 --> 02:25:34,373
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I won't.

1830
02:25:34,393 --> 02:25:35,194
[SPEAKER_20]: I won't start over.

1831
02:25:35,614 --> 02:25:42,878
[SPEAKER_20]: But I'll just continue to say that it more than frustrates me when people come in here and throw around words like that when we have a democratic system of government.

1832
02:25:43,658 --> 02:25:48,341
[SPEAKER_20]: Everyone behind this rail, our school committee, and the mayor was elected democratically by the people.

1833
02:25:48,921 --> 02:25:49,942
[SPEAKER_20]: None of us are perfect.

1834
02:25:50,402 --> 02:25:51,543
[SPEAKER_20]: We're all going to make mistakes.

1835
02:25:51,823 --> 02:25:56,266
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think I know better than most that I'm not always going to get my way.

1836
02:25:57,026 --> 02:25:58,427
[SPEAKER_20]: Nobody's always going to get their way.

1837
02:25:58,627 --> 02:26:00,047
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's what democracy is about.

1838
02:26:00,388 --> 02:26:11,033
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a blessing and a gift handed down to us by the people who came before us that many people have fought for died for on battlefields and in streets across this country.

1839
02:26:11,653 --> 02:26:13,734
[SPEAKER_20]: It's our job to preserve that to improve that.

1840
02:26:14,212 --> 02:26:15,813
[SPEAKER_20]: and not to decry and undermine that.

1841
02:26:15,953 --> 02:26:23,877
[SPEAKER_20]: So when I said last week that this is not totalitarianism and it's an election season, I wasn't speaking in a small and parochial way.

1842
02:26:24,357 --> 02:26:28,560
[SPEAKER_20]: I was speaking in a way that's bigger than every one of us and any one of us.

1843
02:26:29,440 --> 02:26:35,283
[SPEAKER_20]: We are blessed that every two years at every level of government, we get a peaceful revolution.

1844
02:26:35,543 --> 02:26:40,766
[SPEAKER_20]: We get to decide our future and we get to preserve, protect and improve democracy.

1845
02:26:40,946 --> 02:26:42,027
[SPEAKER_20]: That's what we all are here to do.

1846
02:26:42,807 --> 02:26:46,371
[SPEAKER_20]: That's what I will continue to do as long as the people of Medford allow me to do it.

1847
02:26:47,011 --> 02:26:54,899
[SPEAKER_20]: And I just wanted to make that clear to folks online who thought I was making a snide comment when I was actually talking about something much more important than that.

1848
02:26:55,079 --> 02:26:55,400
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1849
02:27:01,547 --> 02:27:04,189
[SPEAKER_13]: If I may, quickly.

1850
02:27:04,930 --> 02:27:06,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, I just have a question.

1851
02:27:06,832 --> 02:27:10,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I have a question for the clerk.

1852
02:27:11,515 --> 02:27:20,463
[SPEAKER_05]: So with General Lasky and Judith moving on, what are the plans or how does that work with regard to the replacements?

1853
02:27:26,331 --> 02:27:30,293
[SPEAKER_05]: And those will have to be, those people have to be sworn in before the next.

1854
02:27:30,333 --> 02:27:33,055
[SPEAKER_18]: They will have to come before the council for confirmation.

1855
02:27:34,175 --> 02:27:35,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct, before the election.

1856
02:27:35,916 --> 02:27:36,096
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1857
02:27:36,456 --> 02:27:37,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you.

1858
02:27:37,537 --> 02:27:37,877

1860

[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Marks, how did you find those records?

1861
02:27:48,923 --> 02:27:52,845
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, I read the records, find them to be in order and move approval.
