File containing the emails from community members on the topic of the renaming will be made available to the advisory committee members so that all advisory committee members are aware of the opinions and concerns expressed by our community. The advisory committee will develop criteria for evaluating the names. The advisory committee will determine the process for vetting the names, narrowing the field and submitting

00:05:26,562 --> 00:05:52,853
no more than three finalists to the school committee. Press relations will be directed through the advisory committee chair and members of the advisory committee are urged to send press contacts to the chair. Advisory committee meetings are public meetings and must follow all requirements of the open meeting law. Superintendent will provide a note taker and create minutes. It is expected that the advisory committee will need to meet three to five times and a majority of voting members will be required to reach a quorum for the meeting.

14
00:05:53,444 --> 00:06:18,183

Signed very truly yours, Dr. Maurice Edwin-Vinson, superintendent of schools. Member McLaughlin, if you could take the roll, please. Sorry, hold on. Member Graham.

18
00:07:47,722 --> 00:08:15,515
Here. Member Kretz. Here. Member McLaughlin here. Member McStone. Here. Member Russo. Here. Member Van de Kloet. She's, okay, let me, there you go. There we go, here, sorry, I was muted. Member Lungocorn, I mean Mayor Lungocorn.

19
00:08:16,173 --> 00:08:24,931
present seven, present zero, absent. We can get right to it. I don't know if Dr. Edwin-Vincent, if you want to just announce how the process will go or if you want me to.

20
00:08:29,302 --> 00:08:58,732
I was going to say, if we would start with you, Mayor, we'd like to start with you selecting the chair before we proceed to the next section, which would be the random number generator. OK, so we're going to start with the chair, and then we're going to pick three out of the 68 applicants randomly by lottery. And then each one will pick one person.

21
00:08:59,322 --> 00:09:26,558
and then we'll go for a second round. And then after that we can announce Principal Kathy Kay, what her decision was on her portion. I'm choosing the chair from the applicants, Mr. Jim Lister, who believes on and has accepted verbally and is ready to take this role of chairing a committee of 23.

22
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:56,258
So we will have that recorded. Susie and Ms. Weiss will be recording on the actual spreadsheet. And Dr. Cushing is going to start screen share the random number generators so that we are able to select the first three candidates that will be added.

23
00:10:02,013 --> 00:10:31,780
Good evening, everyone. I just wanted to quickly show everybody the lottery numbers for this evening. We will cut and paste these into the chat momentarily so that everybody can see them. I'll just finish the scroll up now for the recording. Okay. And then the random number generator is at random.org.

24
00:10:32,793 --> 00:11:01,345
The minimum number is set to number one. The maximum number is 68. And so I will now generate the first number. So the first number is 35. I will now generate the second number. Next number is 63. And I will now generate the final number. That number is 46.

25
00:11:04,754 --> 00:11:27,586
I will now put that in the chat and stop the screen share. Well, at this time what I'll do, 35, 63 and 46, I am going to announce who those three people are. Number 35,

26
00:11:28,615 --> 00:11:54,215
is Kim Nicolosi. And please forgive me if I do pronounce your name incorrectly. I'm sorry, not Kim. No, I'm sorry. Random number generator. If you can screen share it, I'm sorry. Kim Nicolosi is 34. Number 35 is Laura Rotolo. Laura Rotolo.

27
00:11:58,687 --> 00:12:27,509
Number 63 is Ronald Giovino. Ronald Giovino is number 63. And number 46 is Maria Rocha. Maria Rocha. Those three individuals, number 35, I was looking in the wrong column, but number 35 is,

28
00:12:28,117 --> 00:12:51,843
Laura Rotolo. So those are the first three individuals that have been selected. I am going to ask member McLaughlin if she would please use the roll call and as she calls each school committee member, each school committee member will give

29
00:12:52,535 --> 00:13:20,834
a name and that name, your selected choice will be identified on the spreadsheet. Member Russo? I believe you were gonna actually name your second person before we continued. We're gonna try to do the seven through the roll call and have the mayor, since she just gave us the chair, have the mayor be the last person.

30
00:13:21,205 --> 00:13:50,669
and do it in ABC order, like we're in a regular meeting. Member McLaughlin? Actually, I was gonna ask if we could, well, there's no rule that says we have to do it in ABC order for the roll call. So I was gonna ask if we could do it that way on the first and then on the second choice, if we can go in recurrence alphabetical, so then folks that are last aren't feeling left out, or is that an issue for people? I'd rather do it the other way. Just do it. I would say do it. Okay, okay. That's fine.

31
00:13:50,804 --> 00:14:18,378
Whatever you guys want. Hold on one sec. Member Graham. Grace Caldera. Member Kratz. Nicole Donato Jr. Member McLaughlin. Brianna Brothers. Member McStone. Ken Mallon. Member Russo.

32
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:39,185
Aaron Genia. Member Van de Kloot. Beth Fuller. OK, and then we do want to Mayor Wango Karn. Melissa Miguel. OK.

33
00:14:40,619 --> 00:15:05,797
Thank you, I'm gonna just check to make sure we have all people selected. I won't say it in reverse order, but for a member McLaughlin, you selected, is it Brie Brothers? Yes. Member Rousseau selected Erin Genia, member Vander Kloot selected

34
00:15:06,286 --> 00:15:33,438
Beth Fuller, Member Graham selected Grace Caldara, and Member McStone selected Kenneth Mallon, and Mayor selected Melissa Miguel. In Superintendent, you didn't make my announcement. I'm sorry, I'm still scrolling down, sorry. Okay. Member Kratz selected

35
00:15:33,792 --> 00:16:02,547
Paul Donato Jr. And yes, that's everyone's first vote. And I just wanna let you know, Superintendent and Mayor, I am also doing the tally like we normally do. So I'll send that to Susie and those folks as well. So we have that too. Thank you, Member McLaughlin. Would you mind doing it one more time for us?

36
00:16:05,618 --> 00:16:34,103
Not hold on one second. OK. I have to. I'm sorry I have to look at my list too because we have to if others choose them. So I'm trying to multitask here. Bear with me. OK member Graham. Seth Hill. Excuse me, member Kratz.

37
00:16:34,795 --> 00:16:57,847
Lou in Tapa. Member McLaughlin, Henrik Gideon. Member Restone. Pat McCabe. Member Rousseau. A moment, please.

38
00:17:11,482 --> 00:17:33,436
Leroy LaFleur. Sorry, can you say that again? Leroy LaFleur. Thank you. Member Van de Kloet. Kristen Scalise. Marilonga Kern. Dan Puccio.

39
00:17:38,819 --> 00:18:01,415
Do you need me to read those back, Superintendent, or are you? Yes, could you please say them one more time back to me? And I just want to make sure they're marked on the spreadsheet. Okay. Member Graham chose Seth Hill. Okay. Member Kretz chose Lou Intapa. Melanie McLaughlin chose Henrik Gideons.

40
00:18:11,573 --> 00:18:39,738
Tell me when you're ready. I'm ready. Okay, Member McStone chose Pat McCabe. Okay. Member Russo chose Leroy LaFleur. Okay. Member Vanderclue chose Kristen Scalise. Okay. Mayor Lungo-Kern chose Dan Puccio. Okay.

41
00:18:43,366 --> 00:19:12,644
Thank you, member McLaughlin. We have all of those choices documented at this point in time. I would like us to select three alternates using the random number generator just in case. And so we will have our three alternates and we'll identify them as alternate one, alternate two and alternate three.

42
00:19:13,015 --> 00:19:39,273
Mayor? Yes, Member Graham. I believe that our motion, as it was being reread, really explicitly says there'll be no fill-ins or late additions. So I'm not sure that having alternates is in the spirit of what we outlined. So I just want to be clear about that before we randomly pick individuals.

43
00:19:40,808 --> 00:20:07,792
Mayor. Let's say something about one. Let me just reread. Member Russo? I also am not comfortable with additional alternates. We were very clear in the language that we will not be backfilling. And I don't know where that's coming from. Dr. Edward-Vinson.

44
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:30,775
I'm, I'm comfortable with that. And what I can do is just announce then all the 22, uh, 23 members. Um, I will go to the other sheet and say who was identified, um, for the Columbus school by principal Kathy Kaye. Um, and then I will read all of the, um,

45
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:54,653
all of the members that will be part of the advisory committee. So assigned representation will be Principal Kathy Kaye, Dr. Kaye. For the Columbus School representatives, we will have Matthew Havistraw, Kaitlin Shaughnessy, and Janelle Gollin-McKenzie.

46
00:20:55,193 --> 00:21:18,835
And our high school representative who would have been a student who attended the Columbus school is Josie DeFore. So I will go through and list all of the members that have been selected to be part of the advisory committee. Mayor.

47
00:21:19,477 --> 00:21:37,128
Member Vindiclude? I'd like to make a comment, if you would. First, I want to thank everybody who put their name in, and I want to tell you it was very, very difficult to decide. Part of what I was looking at in my, you know, just quickly, was also determining number of men and number of women, and was it

48
00:21:37,128 --> 00:21:58,255
you know, did what sort of names to be seen. But it was very difficult to decide because there was people wrote passionately, people brought different skills. I wanted to include them all. And I really wanted just to thank the members of the public who took the step and put their names in for our consideration.

49
00:21:58,255 --> 00:22:25,373
We really appreciate it. And just because you weren't selected, doesn't mean that you didn't have an awful lot of value to bring. Because there were a lot of people left on my list who I would have loved to have included. Thank you, Member van de Kloet. I feel the same way. We had 68 people interested in a matter of a couple of weeks, and that's pretty remarkable. So you'll be a good committee of 23, and I wish you all the best of luck. I know you'll do a great job.

50
00:22:25,947 --> 00:22:54,382
Thank you to Mr. Lister, who will chair the committee. Yes. Thank you. So I would just like to record all of the participants, just for the record. Member McLaughlin, Brie Brothers, Mayor Longo Kern, Daniel Puccio, Member Rousseau, Erin Genia, Member Vander Kloot, Beth Fuller,

54
00:24:21,322 --> 00:24:50,515
We will have all of the selected candidates, their names compiled in one place so everyone can see who they are. Wonderful, thank you. Thank you. And each committee member will be provided, how are we gonna get all the entries for new names to the committee? Will that just go to the chair? Is that gonna go to all the committee members by email, that list?

55
00:24:52,760 --> 00:25:15,845
Yes, we will. Tomorrow we'll send out a letter of communication to all the members that were officially selected. And then we will work. Now that we know who the chair is, we can work collaboratively with Mr. Lister and with the school committee to keep you abreast of what's happening. Great. Great.

56
00:25:19,422 --> 00:25:48,515
Is there a motion to adjourn? I know we have a six o'clock regularly scheduled meeting. Motion to adjourn. By member Graham, seconded by member McLaughlin, roll call. Member Graham. Yes. Member Kretz. Yes. Member McLaughlin, yes. Member McStone. Yes. Member Rousseau. Yes. Mayor Longo Kern. Yes, 70 affirmative, zero negative. Oh, I'm sorry, member Van de Kloot.
