91
00:08:54,911 --> 00:08:58,452
[SPEAKER_01]: And then each one will pick one person.

92

00:09:37,571 --> 00:09:56,118
[SPEAKER_02]: And Dr. Cushing is going to start screen share the random number generators so that we are able to select the first three candidates that will be added.

99
00:10:02,573 --> 00:10:03,353
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening, everyone.

100
00:10:03,633 --> 00:10:07,774
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to quickly show everybody the lottery numbers for this evening.

101
00:10:08,735 --> 00:10:13,256
[SPEAKER_00]: We will cut and paste these into the chat momentarily so that everybody can see them.

102

103
00:10:18,277 --> 00:10:23,518
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

104
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:31,200
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the random number generator is at random.org.

105
00:10:33,453 --> 00:10:35,174
[SPEAKER_00]: The minimum number is set to number one.

106
00:10:35,214 --> 00:10:36,575
[SPEAKER_00]: The maximum number is 68.

107
00:10:37,535 --> 00:10:39,796
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I will now generate the first number.

108
00:10:44,058 --> 00:10:45,118
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first number is 35.

109
00:10:45,798 --> 00:10:49,320
[SPEAKER_00]: I will now generate the second number.

110
00:10:52,281 --> 00:10:53,802
[SPEAKER_00]: Next number is 63.

111
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:57,904
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will now generate the final number.

112
00:10:59,664 --> 00:11:00,285
[SPEAKER_00]: That number is 46.

113
00:11:04,774 --> 00:11:08,016
[SPEAKER_00]: I will now put that in the chat and stop the screen share.

114
00:11:12,098 --> 00:11:23,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, at this time what I'll do, 35, 63 and 46, I am going to announce who those three people are.

00:12:28,257 --> 00:12:29,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Laura Rotolo.

131

00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:50,943
[SPEAKER_02]: I am going to ask member McLaughlin if she would please use the roll call and as she calls each school committee member, each school committee member will give

136
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:20,654

137
00:13:21,305 --> 00:13:25,509
[SPEAKER_02]: and do it in ABC order, like we're in a regular meeting.

138
00:13:26,409 --> 00:13:27,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Member McLaughlin?

139
00:13:28,011 --> 00:13:33,955
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I was gonna ask if we could, well, there's no rule that says we have to do it in ABC order for the roll call.

140
00:13:33,975 --> 00:13:43,563
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was gonna ask if we could do it that way on the first and then on the second choice, if we can go in recurrence alphabetical, so then folks that are last aren't feeling left out, or is that an issue for people?

141
00:13:44,364 --> 00:13:45,445
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd rather do it the other way.

142
00:13:46,886 --> 00:13:47,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Just do it.

143
00:13:47,546 --> 00:13:48,207
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say do it.

144
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:48,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, okay.

145
00:13:50,189 --> 00:13:50,529
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fine.

146
00:13:50,804 --> 00:13:51,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever you guys want.

147
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:53,245

OK.

[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, I'm gonna just check to make sure we have all people selected.

164
00:14:45,983 --> 00:14:58,051
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't say it in reverse order, but for a member McLaughlin, you selected, is it Brie Brothers?

165
00:14:58,432 --> 00:15:00,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

00:15:00,493 --> 00:15:05,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Rousseau selected Erin Genia, member Vander Kloot selected

167
00:15:06,326 --> 00:15:24,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Beth Fuller, Member Graham selected Grace Caldara, and Member McStone selected Kenneth Mallon, and Mayor selected Melissa Miguel.

168
00:15:26,415 --> 00:15:28,556
[SPEAKER_07]: In Superintendent, you didn't make my announcement.

169
00:15:29,016 --> 00:15:30,677
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, I'm still scrolling down, sorry.

170
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:30,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

171
00:15:31,277 --> 00:15:32,718

[SPEAKER_02]: Paul Donato Jr.

173
00:15:36,774 --> 00:15:42,697
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, that's everyone's first vote.

174
00:15:43,857 --> 00:15:48,960
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just wanna let you know, Superintendent and Mayor, I am also doing the tally like we normally do.

175
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:53,162
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll send that to Susie and those folks as well.

176
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,203
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have that too.

177
00:15:57,504 --> 00:15:59,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Member McLaughlin.

178
00:16:00,186 --> 00:16:02,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you mind doing it one more time for us?

179
00:16:05,838 --> 00:16:07,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Not hold on one second.

180
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:12,799
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

181
00:16:12,819 --> 00:16:15,900
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to.

182
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:20,301
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry I have to look at my list too because we have to if others choose them.

183
00:16:20,341 --> 00:16:21,601
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm trying to multitask here.

184
00:16:21,661 --> 00:16:22,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Bear with me.

185
00:16:23,281 --> 00:16:24,581
[SPEAKER_05]: OK member Graham.

186
00:16:30,002 --> 00:16:30,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Seth Hill.

187
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:33,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Excuse me, member Kratz.

188
00:16:34,895 --> 00:16:35,856

[SPEAKER_03]: Leroy LaFleur.

195
00:17:12,443 --> 00:17:15,144

[SPEAKER_01]: Dan Puccio.

202
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:41,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you need me to read those back, Superintendent, or are you?

203
00:17:41,941 --> 00:17:44,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, could you please say them one more time back to me?

204
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,725
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just want to make sure they're marked on the spreadsheet.

205
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:47,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

206
00:17:47,585 --> 00:17:49,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham chose Seth Hill.

207
00:17:50,888 --> 00:17:51,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

208
00:17:52,088 --> 00:17:54,710
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Kretz chose Lou Intapa.

209
00:17:57,692 --> 00:18:01,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Melanie McLaughlin chose Henrik Gideons.

210
00:18:11,573 --> 00:18:12,213
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell me when you're ready.

211
00:18:12,233 --> 00:18:13,093
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm ready.

212
00:18:13,113 --> 00:18:15,634
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, Member McStone chose Pat McCabe.

213
00:18:15,654 --> 00:18:19,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

214
00:18:19,514 --> 00:18:21,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Russo chose Leroy LaFleur.

215
00:18:21,915 --> 00:18:26,156
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

216
00:18:26,936 --> 00:18:29,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Vanderclue chose Kristen Scalise.

217
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:33,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

218
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:36,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor Lungo-Kern chose Dan Puccio.

219
00:18:36,557 --> 00:18:39,518
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

220
00:18:43,366 --> 00:18:45,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, member McLaughlin.

221
00:18:45,407 --> 00:18:51,871
[SPEAKER_02]: We have all of those choices documented at this point in time.

222
00:18:53,152 --> 00:19:02,838
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like us to select three alternates using the random number generator just in case.

223
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:12,444
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we will have our three alternates and we'll identify them as alternate one, alternate two and alternate three.

224
00:19:13,075 --> 00:19:13,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Mayor?

225
00:19:14,956 --> 00:19:16,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Member Graham.

226
00:19:16,557 --> 00:19:26,024
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe that our motion, as it was being reread, really explicitly says there'll be no fill-ins or late additions.

227
00:19:26,204 --> 00:19:34,810
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm not sure that having alternates is in the spirit of what we outlined.

228
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:39,113
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just want to be clear about that before we randomly pick individuals.

229
00:19:40,848 --> 00:19:41,088
[SPEAKER_01]: Mayor.

230
00:19:41,228 --> 00:19:42,409
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say something about one.

231
00:19:42,429 --> 00:19:43,490
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me just reread.

232
00:19:43,731 --> 00:19:44,391
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Russo?

233
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:47,654
[SPEAKER_04]: I also am not comfortable with additional alternates.

234
00:19:47,734 --> 00:19:50,497
[SPEAKER_04]: We were very clear in the language that we will not be backfilling.

235
00:19:51,397 --> 00:19:55,141
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know where that's coming from.

236
00:20:06,131 --> 00:20:07,131
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Edward-Vinson.

237
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:09,770
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm, I'm comfortable with that.

238
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:15,932
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I can do is just announce then all the 22, uh, 23 members.

239
00:20:16,812 --> 00:20:25,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I will go to the other sheet and say who was identified, um, for the Columbus school by principal Kathy Kaye.

240
00:20:27,054 --> 00:20:30,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then I will read all of the, um,

241
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:36,935
[SPEAKER_02]: all of the members that will be part of the advisory committee.

242
00:20:37,635 --> 00:20:42,681
[SPEAKER_02]: So assigned representation will be Principal Kathy Kaye, Dr. Kaye.

243
00:20:44,122 --> 00:20:54,132
[SPEAKER_02]: For the Columbus School representatives, we will have Matthew Havistraw, Kaitlin Shaughnessy, and Janelle Gollin-McKenzie.

244
00:20:55,253 --> 00:21:03,861
[SPEAKER_02]: And our high school representative who would have been a student who attended the Columbus school is Josie DeFore.

245
00:21:05,282 --> 00:21:15,972
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will go through and list all of the members that have been selected to be part of the advisory committee.

246
00:21:18,495 --> 00:21:18,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Mayor.

247
00:21:19,517 --> 00:21:20,157
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Vindiclude?

248
00:21:20,658 --> 00:21:22,219
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to make a comment, if you would.

249
00:21:22,939 --> 00:21:28,523
[SPEAKER_07]: First, I want to thank everybody who put their name in, and I want to tell you it was very, very difficult to decide.

250
00:21:29,263 --> 00:21:36,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Part of what I was looking at in my, you know, just quickly, was also determining number of men and number of women, and was it

251
00:21:37,268 --> 00:21:39,969
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, did what sort of names to be seen.

252
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:47,752
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was very difficult to decide because there was people wrote passionately, people brought different skills.

253
00:21:48,172 --> 00:21:49,512
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to include them all.

254
00:21:50,132 --> 00:21:57,955
[SPEAKER_07]: And I really wanted just to thank the members of the public who took the step and put their names in for our consideration.

255
00:21:58,795 --> 00:21:59,976
[SPEAKER_07]: We really appreciate it.

256
00:22:00,336 --> 00:22:05,019
[SPEAKER_07]: And just because you weren't selected, doesn't mean that you didn't have an awful lot of value to bring.

257
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:09,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Because there were a lot of people left on my list who I would have loved to have included.

258
00:22:09,082 --> 00:22:12,084
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Member van de Kloet.

259
00:22:12,124 --> 00:22:12,945
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel the same way.

260
00:22:13,105 --> 00:22:17,548
[SPEAKER_01]: We had 68 people interested in a matter of a couple of weeks, and that's pretty remarkable.

261
00:22:17,688 --> 00:22:21,891
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll be a good committee of 23, and I wish you all the best of luck.

262
00:22:23,292 --> 00:22:24,172
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you'll do a great job.

263
00:22:26,047 --> 00:22:28,348
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you to Mr. Lister, who will chair the committee.

264
00:22:29,129 --> 00:22:29,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

265
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:31,710
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

266
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:37,853
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would just like to record all of the participants, just for the record.

[SPEAKER_02]: We will have all of the selected candidates, their names compiled in one place so everyone can see who they are.

283
00:24:33,607 --> 00:24:34,348
[SPEAKER_01]: Wonderful, thank you.

284
00:24:34,928 --> 00:24:35,368
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

285
00:24:35,748 --> 00:24:44,913
[SPEAKER_01]: And each committee member will be provided, how are we gonna get all the entries for new names to the committee?

286
00:24:44,953 --> 00:24:46,113
[SPEAKER_01]: Will that just go to the chair?

287
00:24:46,173 --> 00:24:50,275
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that gonna go to all the committee members by email, that list?

288
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we will.

289
00:24:54,760 --> 00:25:00,702
