1
00:00:00,385 --> 00:00:01,646
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01,666 --> 00:00:13,993
This is the 2024 to 2025 cycle of the Commission for Persons with Disabilities meeting, and this is October 23rd, 2024.

3
00:00:14,773 --> 00:00:27,201
I'm Frances Mwaje, I'm the DEI Director for the City of Medford, ADA Coordinator for the City, and also Liaison for the Commission.

4
00:00:28,602 --> 00:00:35,167
I will hand it over to other commissioners that are currently in attendance.

5
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:38,350
Over to you, Sue.

6
00:00:39,744 --> 00:00:43,006
Hi, I am Susan Bibbins.

7
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:54,755
I live in South Medford, and I've been a commissioner for a number of years.

8
00:00:54,775 --> 00:00:56,336
I forget how many.

9
00:00:56,356 --> 00:01:01,320
And I am happy to be here.

10
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,261
I hand it over to you, Kim.

11
00:01:05,692 --> 00:01:06,253
Thanks Sue.

12
00:01:06,673 --> 00:01:08,615
I am Cam Nav here.

13
00:01:09,656 --> 00:01:19,305
I live in Medford in the Heights and I'm approaching my first full year on the commission.

14
00:01:27,112 --> 00:01:29,315
Thank you Sue and thank you Cam.

15
00:01:31,139 --> 00:01:39,323
I wanted to announce that there is an intern finally working out of the Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.

16
00:01:40,604 --> 00:01:56,491
His name is Nicholas Karenge and he is the disability specialist intern that has been supporting the work of this office with a primary focus on all things disability related.

17
00:01:57,931 --> 00:02:03,855
Nick brings to us his lived experience.

18
00:02:04,315 --> 00:02:13,940
Nick was one of the first students to go through all three different schools in MedFed.

19
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,604
He was the first student to go through and graduate from the McGlynn.

20
00:02:21,384 --> 00:02:35,276
The only reason that Nick is not with us today is because he attended the National Disability Employment Awareness Month celebratory event at the State House.

21
00:02:36,236 --> 00:02:42,401
But you've probably noticed his name on correspondence that I have sent out.

22
00:02:42,582 --> 00:02:43,282
He is a

23
00:02:44,503 --> 00:02:54,767
wealth of knowledge and very supportive and really helps me with troubleshooting and problem solving.

24
00:02:54,787 --> 00:03:01,910
It would also be a support to us on the commission as well.

25
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:04,150
So I just wanted to share that.

26
00:03:06,111 --> 00:03:07,812
And Joe, welcome.

27
00:03:07,872 --> 00:03:10,673
Would you like to introduce yourself?

28
00:03:10,693 --> 00:03:12,934
Hi, I'm Joe.

29
00:03:16,148 --> 00:03:19,310
I felt like last year I was a rookie commissioner.

30
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,250
I learned a lot.

31
00:03:21,591 --> 00:03:23,452
Just very nice people involved.

32
00:03:24,313 --> 00:03:25,994
Lifelong resident of Medford.

33
00:03:26,174 --> 00:03:28,595
Went to Medford schools.

34
00:03:29,856 --> 00:03:32,258
I taught two years at the vocational school.

35
00:03:33,623 --> 00:03:38,725
I just retired 25 years, Department of Corrections as a supervisor.

36
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:40,886
Got my real estate license.

37
00:03:41,227 --> 00:03:44,788
I have also a contractor's license.

38
00:03:45,909 --> 00:03:53,172
I do have a disabled child that's 32, and I'm here to help out in any way I can.

39
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:59,575
And my pet peeve is people parking in handicapped spots that don't belong there.

40
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:05,206
Thank you so much, Joe.

41
00:04:05,886 --> 00:04:29,376
Yes, and when I do get those calls, I make sure I have some boots and ground days, and I go out to the locations where people like to park in the accessible parking spots, and I ensure that if the cars don't have a placard, that law enforcement, who is the one who actually issues those tickets out, are contacted right then and there.

42
00:04:30,456 --> 00:04:34,038
As we know, everything, all the thresholds are low, right?

43
00:04:34,558 --> 00:04:38,739
The ADA is a very, very low threshold for accessibility.

44
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:43,281
If we don't strive to meet that, then what exactly are we doing, right?

45
00:04:43,381 --> 00:04:52,304
The state regulations and federal regulations of the number of accessible parking spots to the non-accessible parking spots.

46
00:04:52,344 --> 00:04:54,745
I mean, these are just, these are very low thresholds.

47
00:04:54,865 --> 00:04:58,807
So it is definitely not something that the,

48
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:03,749
city is going to take lightly.

49
00:05:04,409 --> 00:05:07,210
So, all right.

50
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,171
Could you hold on one second?

51
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,232
It seems like somebody is at my door.

52
00:05:12,452 --> 00:05:13,052
I don't know what

53
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:30,759
It was a cookie delivery, but I declined.

54
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,041
It was a cookie offer, but I declined.

55
00:05:36,322 --> 00:05:36,942
I was good.

56
00:05:38,023 --> 00:05:50,469
So there were some applicants that I had reached out to to see if they wanted to join us today in speaking and on the phone with the applicants.

57
00:05:55,431 --> 00:05:57,353
They said that they were interested.

58
00:05:57,373 --> 00:05:59,875
I did, and I forwarded the link.

59
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:07,082
I do know that one applicant is actually out of town right now for work-related purposes.

60
00:06:07,563 --> 00:06:15,330
So that applicant did say that they would try to get on, but they are out of town for work-related purposes.

61
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:20,174
Another applicant emailed me and said, they're not able to do it at this time.

62
00:06:20,995 --> 00:06:34,260
And I, you know, I think that for the sake of people's time, because you are here and you are committed to this, I'm not going to keep going back to say to issue reminders.

63
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,102
I just don't think that that is fair to the commissioners that show up on a.

64
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:43,555
Regular regular basis, right?

65
00:06:43,675 --> 00:06:44,036
So.

66
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:49,720
The meeting date doesn't change, so I didn't issue any reminders today to say, hey.

67
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:54,423
You know, don't forget we have a meeting only because we spoke yesterday.

68
00:06:55,944 --> 00:07:04,070
If that makes sense, so I don't have any new commissioners to introduce to you, but hopefully next next cycle.

69
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:08,053
Will will be available to make that introduction.

70
00:07:09,604 --> 00:07:15,470
The 1 thing on our schedule, because this this always happens at our September meeting.

71
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:17,812
It's our November meeting.

72
00:07:19,153 --> 00:07:26,540
We need to look at our November meeting because it actually falls on Thanksgiving.

73
00:07:27,301 --> 00:07:31,024
Eve, which has historically been a.

74
00:07:32,503 --> 00:07:39,106
You know, being a date that we change on behalf of many commissioners.

75
00:07:40,547 --> 00:07:52,513
We have more than enough time to do what we've done in the past, which is either bring that meeting of November 27th up to the previous week of November 20th.

76
00:07:53,233 --> 00:07:55,374
Or drop that meeting down.

77
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:14,589
to the week of December 4th, but I have to make sure that also pay attention to Wednesday, December 25th, which is not just Christmas, but also Hanukkah begins.

78
00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:25,012
So I open the floor to suggestions on what to do for our November meeting.

79
00:08:30,837 --> 00:08:44,993
I vote that we do it in December only because I am trying to schedule an early Thanksgiving with my parents.

80
00:08:45,514 --> 00:08:47,616
So I'm going to possibly be out of town.

81
00:08:48,842 --> 00:08:51,624
Okay, and we've done that before.

82
00:08:51,684 --> 00:08:55,886
We have moved the meeting to the first week of December.

83
00:08:56,687 --> 00:09:03,711
Joe, would that pose any issues for you if we moved the November meeting to December 4th?

84
00:09:03,851 --> 00:09:04,972
No problem at all.

85
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:06,112
I don't have a problem with that.

86
00:09:06,773 --> 00:09:08,494
Okay, and how about you, Kim?

87
00:09:12,396 --> 00:09:13,056
No problem.

88
00:09:13,237 --> 00:09:13,897
That works great.

89
00:09:14,731 --> 00:09:27,280
Okay, and then maybe what we'll do then is we'll call that a combined meeting because nobody's meeting Christmas Day or Hanukkah Day and nobody is meeting New Year's Day either.

90
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:33,924
So we'll call that our combined November and December meeting.

91
00:09:33,944 --> 00:09:39,088
Sounds great to me.

92
00:09:40,568 --> 00:09:41,489
Thank you.

93
00:09:42,069 --> 00:09:55,261
And I think for now, I think we're typically good until we get to around the Christian Easter period where there might be some shutdowns.

94
00:09:55,281 --> 00:09:59,705
But I know that our usual issue is the November and December meeting.

95
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:03,528
So thankful that we have that sorted out.

96
00:10:05,975 --> 00:10:08,976
Cam, I don't mean to put you on the spot.

97
00:10:10,297 --> 00:10:14,418
Commissioners, I took a week off and I went to Nashville.

98
00:10:14,878 --> 00:10:20,920
And because I was with friends and visiting friends for the first time, I really didn't do anything on my week off.

99
00:10:21,701 --> 00:10:28,223
So my brain is still trying to settle down here.

100
00:10:29,203 --> 00:10:33,525
But Cam, did we select a date for the disability fair?

101
00:10:35,752 --> 00:10:39,193
Do we recall or did we select just the season?

102
00:10:42,354 --> 00:10:47,075
Yeah, we had only selected the season.

103
00:10:47,155 --> 00:10:52,316
We knew we wanted to do it after the Inclusive Playground launched.

104
00:10:53,356 --> 00:10:54,417
And then, I think,

105
00:10:58,143 --> 00:11:06,067
We checked in with the school and it was a little bit hard for them to let us know what dates they had open before the principal gave his input.

106
00:11:06,908 --> 00:11:16,974
But, you know, it seems to me like at the beginning of a new school year, maybe now is a good time to see what the school calendar looks like.

107
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:23,578
And we were looking, if I'm not mistaken, were we looking at like March or April?

108
00:11:23,618 --> 00:11:26,500
Because our hope was that the weather would be better.

109
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:29,302
I think April, yes.

110
00:11:29,902 --> 00:11:30,383
April, okay.

111
00:11:33,605 --> 00:11:35,747
Would you like me, oh, I'm sorry, Sue.

112
00:11:35,767 --> 00:11:40,991
We've gotta be careful because I think that's when, maybe when MCAS.

113
00:11:42,372 --> 00:11:42,852
Okay.

114
00:11:44,853 --> 00:11:49,417
Or around when MCAS is scheduled.

115
00:11:54,987 --> 00:11:58,871
And I know that the school has a transition there.

116
00:11:59,711 --> 00:12:07,258
Is it and I want to say that I think it is in March.

117
00:12:08,237 --> 00:12:16,884
If you give me some time, I can look into that for you and just respond to all of you via email.

118
00:12:18,965 --> 00:12:28,433
But I can also look at the calendar and book space if you think that any, are we looking at any weekend in April?

119
00:12:29,013 --> 00:12:32,116
Like, are we looking at like a Saturday, a Sunday?

120
00:12:32,176 --> 00:12:34,357
Do you have preferences at this time?

121
00:12:36,379 --> 00:12:37,340
Not Passover.

122
00:12:38,423 --> 00:12:40,685
Not the beginning of Passover.

123
00:12:41,486 --> 00:12:42,467
Okay.

124
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:45,570
Just the beginning.

125
00:12:46,071 --> 00:12:51,717
The first two, three days of Passover are the big ones.

126
00:12:52,778 --> 00:12:53,338
Okay.

127
00:13:00,526 --> 00:13:01,427
So April,

128
00:13:03,233 --> 00:13:09,681
And I don't know whether Passover is April or May or March.

129
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:14,828
Let me go on mute so that I don't hurt people.

130
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:52,246
Okay, Google University says that Passover starts the evening of Saturday, April 12th, and it goes on to Sunday, April 20th in 2025.

131
00:13:53,947 --> 00:14:04,493
The first three days are, well, the first two days, but the first two evenings of Passover are the holy ones.

132
00:14:05,073 --> 00:14:07,455
Like they're going to be your savers.

133
00:14:08,756 --> 00:14:09,076
Okay.

134
00:14:11,177 --> 00:14:17,960
So I would not schedule it, try not to schedule it on the first three days.

135
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:26,363
Okay, so nothing Saturday the 12th, nothing Sunday the 13th, and nothing Monday the 14th.

136
00:14:26,383 --> 00:14:26,823
Right.

137
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:56,519
Kim and Joe, if I were to work with the school on looking for a Saturday or a Sunday that doesn't interfere with Passover, do you have a preference for the beginning?

138
00:14:56,539 --> 00:15:01,223
Oh no, because we're thinking May, okay, April, May.

139
00:15:01,863 --> 00:15:03,805
So more towards the end of the month then.

140
00:15:03,965 --> 00:15:05,426
Sorry, that was a silly question.

141
00:15:05,867 --> 00:15:07,608
All right, what about a timeframe?

142
00:15:13,049 --> 00:15:13,909
I'll speak for a minute.

143
00:15:14,109 --> 00:15:16,830
Are we talking indoors or outdoors?

144
00:15:17,851 --> 00:15:25,273
We're talking outdoors at the new universal playground and we might, you know, we might use indoors too.

145
00:15:26,173 --> 00:15:30,535
If people, you know, the weather or the restrooms or whatever.

146
00:15:31,235 --> 00:15:36,637
I made a suggestion last year and I got some good support about it.

147
00:15:39,835 --> 00:15:46,522
small celebration in a way of, I can find donors and have an ice cream celebration.

148
00:15:47,983 --> 00:15:57,872
And if somebody wanted to make their own ice cream, I mean, I'm willing to kick it around, but I'm offering to do most of the work as far as

149
00:15:59,226 --> 00:16:02,428
you know, paper plates, napkins, ice cream, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.

150
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:11,632
And I thought that would be an incentive for people to come out, come down, have an ice cream, hang out.

151
00:16:12,233 --> 00:16:16,395
And that way it would draw people like, hey, what's in it for me?

152
00:16:19,076 --> 00:16:22,499
It's not expensive when you buy ice cream in large volume.

153
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:29,064
It was just an idea and I'm just looking for feedback and it's just a suggestion.

154
00:16:31,466 --> 00:16:33,148
I think that that sounds great.

155
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:38,492
That means all the more reason for us to have outdoor and indoor space as well.

156
00:16:40,446 --> 00:16:45,307
because some folks might need more of the stability of a table.

157
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:51,949
I think that you can continue to work with the commissioners on a variety of different ideas.

158
00:16:52,669 --> 00:17:03,232
For now, I really wanna narrow down a timeframe and a date for you guys before you get given the run again and we can't get on the schedule.

159
00:17:03,292 --> 00:17:08,573
I mean, Cam tried really hard last year and I think there was like two or three months

160
00:17:09,233 --> 00:17:12,374
before he could get some, you know, responses.

161
00:17:12,394 --> 00:17:15,255
So I'm just looking at like timeframe.

162
00:17:15,315 --> 00:17:19,937
Are we looking at like 10 to 2, 10 to 1, 11 to 2?

163
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:21,557
Like what works?

164
00:17:24,659 --> 00:17:24,999
11 to 2?

165
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:29,000
Does that work for your ice cream thing?

166
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,661
I think, I think that's great.

167
00:17:33,402 --> 00:17:33,642
Yeah.

168
00:17:34,461 --> 00:17:37,602
I think 11 to 2 is a great time as well.

169
00:17:37,622 --> 00:17:46,204
It allows parents who are caring for more physically challenged children to at least not have to rush.

170
00:17:48,284 --> 00:17:49,025
Okay, 11 to 2.

171
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:54,066
All right.

172
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:58,892
So that will be my homework, and I might report.

173
00:17:59,932 --> 00:18:14,158
I'm hoping I can report via email instead of having to wait till the next meeting, because I think that once we have a date narrowed down, then you can really start to build out the event.

174
00:18:14,838 --> 00:18:21,601
Joe, thank you so much for the offer to bring one of my favorite treats there.

175
00:18:21,641 --> 00:18:24,562
You'll all have to remind me that the ice cream is not

176
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:28,993
Really appreciate that.

177
00:18:31,594 --> 00:18:35,475
Sue, can I turn it over to you so that you can ask your question?

178
00:18:35,756 --> 00:18:36,816
Yes.

179
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:38,737
Yes.

180
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:48,180
In my experience for voting, I vote early by mail.

181
00:18:49,081 --> 00:18:54,422
But every time I've gone and the early voting and

182
00:18:56,348 --> 00:19:09,824
I've asked the powers that be, the monitor that sits there, how is, you know, is the accessible voting all set?

183
00:19:10,425 --> 00:19:14,129
Meaning is the accessible voting ready for

184
00:19:16,765 --> 00:19:25,213
someone who needs it, I've gotten the answer, yes, yes, it's all set, all ready to go, etc, etc.

185
00:19:25,773 --> 00:19:29,557
And then I've had the experience that friends have

186
00:19:33,264 --> 00:19:36,265
said to me, oh, it wasn't set up.

187
00:19:37,065 --> 00:19:41,127
Nobody knows and nobody knew what they were doing.

188
00:19:41,207 --> 00:19:45,389
Nobody had the key to unlock it, et cetera, et cetera.

189
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:53,813
To my feeling is that maybe we ought to check at our polling places.

190
00:19:55,133 --> 00:20:03,717
or just, you know, make a schedule and check at every polling places, that it's actually true.

191
00:20:06,098 --> 00:20:16,983
That the accessible polling places and accessible polling machines are up and ready to go.

192
00:20:17,323 --> 00:20:20,545
So if somebody needs them, they don't have to go through this

193
00:20:22,517 --> 00:20:37,361
waiting for a key, waiting for somebody who knows how to run the machine because that's a block to voting and that's pretty serious.

194
00:20:37,741 --> 00:20:42,963
I was just asking, wanting to bring that up in the meeting.

195
00:20:42,983 --> 00:20:47,004
Thank you so much, Sue.

196
00:20:47,104 --> 00:20:47,424
Joe?

197
00:20:47,444 --> 00:20:51,185
I was going to bring up the same subject but

198
00:20:54,030 --> 00:21:13,397
I think it's great on the City Hall website, right on the first page, you can still sign up for a mail-in ballot now, and also you can, early voting, and I think it's great.

199
00:21:13,557 --> 00:21:20,220
It pops right out, and then, because I really think it's gonna be a big turnout this year,

200
00:21:22,205 --> 00:21:24,766
I think the city did a great job posting it.

201
00:21:25,847 --> 00:21:39,734
And so if you know somebody with some type of disability, they still get a week or so to apply for the other methods also of voting instead of going that particular day.

202
00:21:40,334 --> 00:21:45,037
But I think no matter what, I think they're going to be overwhelmed.

203
00:21:46,632 --> 00:22:00,457
So I, you know, I like the fact that there are different options, but I also recognize that there are people, you know, the importance of being able to vote on actual voting day without barriers, despite the options.

204
00:22:02,097 --> 00:22:05,579
If you can, do you have anything to add to this?

205
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:08,860
No, I.

206
00:22:12,351 --> 00:22:22,974
If you give me a minute to, I think what I heard you say is like finding a schedule or like the location of the accessible polling stations.

207
00:22:22,994 --> 00:22:24,495
Is that correct?

208
00:22:24,515 --> 00:22:24,615
Right.

209
00:22:24,895 --> 00:22:39,859
I mean, I don't even know if early voting, the accessible voting station at early voting is up and running or you have to, you know, nobody knows what they're doing and stuff like that.

210
00:22:41,661 --> 00:22:48,425
So what I can do, because my friends, the election commission's office is actually right next door to mine.

211
00:22:48,445 --> 00:22:51,127
It is up to you guys.

212
00:22:51,327 --> 00:22:58,572
I can either take a brief hiatus and step away, see if the elections manager is available.

213
00:22:58,592 --> 00:23:05,276
Danielle may or may not be, depending on what's happening, because right now early voting is going on.

214
00:23:06,016 --> 00:23:19,528
or I can get a meeting together to figure out where the locations are, who's responsible for the training, and then share that if commissioners do want to go out and test.

215
00:23:20,229 --> 00:23:24,673
I do see that very much as being a part of the work.

216
00:23:26,843 --> 00:23:37,048
There are people who, you know, one of our abatement greeters said to me yesterday, Frances, I feel bad.

217
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:42,811
I keep telling people that they can put their ballots in the blue box, but they don't want to do that.

218
00:23:42,871 --> 00:23:46,032
They want to give the ballots over to a person.

219
00:23:46,533 --> 00:23:48,994
So there are still people who, you know,

220
00:23:49,554 --> 00:24:00,802
have a pride, a joy, and a sense of connection on actually voting in what I would say is the typical or traditional sense of how voting is done.

221
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:11,329
And I would want to make sure that if they choose to exercise that right, there is as little barrier as to the extent possible.

222
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:13,110
Right.

223
00:24:13,331 --> 00:24:15,112
And I just

224
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:22,121
I don't know if we have the authority to go in and test.

225
00:24:23,042 --> 00:24:26,605
I actually believe that you do from looking at the ordinance.

226
00:24:27,125 --> 00:24:33,130
But if you give me another 2.2 seconds, let me pull up the ordinance.

227
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:41,097
I think it's one of the things that the ordinance does point out.

228
00:24:42,782 --> 00:24:47,063
If I can find the ordinance all of a sudden I don't know how to operate my computer anymore.

229
00:24:55,186 --> 00:25:02,248
What happens when you think you're cool and fancy and you're working with multiple screens?

230
00:25:02,348 --> 00:25:04,149
You don't know what screen you're looking at.

231
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:11,511
It's ordinance.

232
00:25:25,686 --> 00:25:30,730
Because if that is, if that is not in the ordinance.

233
00:25:32,131 --> 00:25:38,475
I would highly encourage the commission to make that request.

234
00:25:39,356 --> 00:25:42,398
Of city council, because it's just, I mean.

235
00:25:42,418 --> 00:25:45,440
It's just so important.

236
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:46,201
Yeah.

237
00:25:53,731 --> 00:26:07,323
Just to cut in real quick, when I vote at my polling location at the Robert Schooney Heights, a brand new building, but I noticed that most people vote standing up.

238
00:26:08,164 --> 00:26:17,031
And the desktop, if you want to call it that, with the dividers, it's about four and a half, maybe

239
00:26:18,095 --> 00:26:19,556
It's about four and a half feet high.

240
00:26:19,576 --> 00:26:25,419
And I don't know what they do if somebody's in a wheelchair, if they have like a low desk.

241
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,001
They're supposed to.

242
00:26:28,802 --> 00:26:31,103
They're supposed to have that already set up.

243
00:26:31,843 --> 00:26:32,484
Oh, OK.

244
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:34,365
Maybe I didn't notice it in the past.

245
00:26:35,626 --> 00:26:41,189
I have encountered at my polling place that they use it as a work desk.

246
00:26:44,428 --> 00:26:51,572
I said to whoever would listen, that's not supposed to happen, that's supposed to be left open.

247
00:26:55,515 --> 00:27:06,841
I don't know what they did because I didn't check, but I think they cleared it off and the person worked elsewhere.

248
00:27:08,782 --> 00:27:09,863
But it's supposed to be,

249
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:17,455
left open and a designated space.

250
00:27:17,955 --> 00:27:19,416
Yeah.

251
00:27:19,556 --> 00:27:20,417
It doesn't move.

252
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:30,224
The space has to be wide enough in case somebody is in some mobility device to be able to come in and still have their privacy.

253
00:27:31,225 --> 00:27:34,788
Because at City Hall, the designated space is

254
00:27:36,142 --> 00:27:39,804
if you're looking at the staircase, it's to the right.

255
00:27:40,865 --> 00:27:45,188
Because what we do is we move all the jewelry cases out.

256
00:27:45,428 --> 00:27:51,171
That was what we did when the elevator was down and we had to put everything on the first floor.

257
00:27:52,032 --> 00:27:55,154
But it is not an extra work desk.

258
00:27:57,435 --> 00:28:01,258
I've just pulled up the ordinance very quickly.

259
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:06,423
Let me do a screen share.

260
00:28:06,443 --> 00:28:07,584
Okay.

261
00:28:09,386 --> 00:28:11,048
Where is the share screen?

262
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:19,497
Are you able to see?

263
00:28:19,517 --> 00:28:19,878
Yes.

264
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:25,071
So I'm going to scroll down.

265
00:28:25,151 --> 00:28:28,752
My cursor says powers and duties.

266
00:28:29,433 --> 00:28:32,634
So I am going to scroll right down to that.

267
00:28:32,654 --> 00:28:35,695
Okay.

268
00:28:36,556 --> 00:28:48,541
First one, Sue, to ensure the equal status of a disabled person in education, economic, political, health, and local spheres.

269
00:29:00,465 --> 00:29:06,628
I'm thinking that that is, again, it says shall include but not limited to.

270
00:29:06,788 --> 00:29:09,730
I think that that is well within the scope of the commission.

271
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:11,190
Yeah.

272
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:15,372
You know what I might do?

273
00:29:16,553 --> 00:29:22,036
I might just visit two or three polling places and just check it out maybe someday for the future.

274
00:29:22,881 --> 00:29:44,057
Well, why don't because because we're already getting ready to vote, why don't you if it's if it's all right with you, let me find out from Daniel when we're done with this meeting so that I can send you all the same email or the same information.

275
00:29:45,253 --> 00:29:50,037
And maybe if time permits, we can all tag team.

276
00:29:50,898 --> 00:29:55,942
I really don't want November 5th, you know, is it even the 5th now?

277
00:29:56,022 --> 00:29:57,002
Even I'm confused.

278
00:29:57,583 --> 00:30:02,587
I just don't want voting day to get here and we've got an issue somewhere.

279
00:30:03,127 --> 00:30:03,448
Right.

280
00:30:04,909 --> 00:30:08,872
And Nick would be more than happy to help with that as well.

281
00:30:15,465 --> 00:30:20,367
So, I'm trying to see if this.

282
00:30:21,808 --> 00:30:28,911
So, and just it looks like the, it looks like our ordinance was updated on October 2nd of this year.

283
00:30:29,792 --> 00:30:31,212
So, maybe, you know.

284
00:30:31,232 --> 00:30:33,593
No, they changed laws.

285
00:30:34,134 --> 00:30:39,196
Yeah, I don't I think that anytime somebody makes a change to the ordinance.

286
00:30:41,377 --> 00:30:42,637
It automatically.

287
00:30:46,225 --> 00:30:47,805
shows up with a new date.

288
00:30:48,486 --> 00:31:02,510
So it'd be a good idea for me to send this link out to everyone so that folks can see the most recent ordinance and have the best understanding.

289
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:04,050
Yes.

290
00:31:25,087 --> 00:31:28,134
If you need me to scroll up for anything, let me know.

291
00:31:28,154 --> 00:31:31,061
We'll scroll down.

292
00:31:31,081 --> 00:31:34,067
These are the functions.

293
00:32:13,453 --> 00:32:13,853
Yeah.

294
00:32:19,598 --> 00:32:24,482
Anyone have any updates or anything that they'd like to share?

295
00:32:24,502 --> 00:32:31,148
Or any correspondence?

296
00:32:40,072 --> 00:32:46,967
Has there been a notice like on a city website that there's openings for volunteers for the Disability Commission?

297
00:32:48,101 --> 00:32:51,263
Yes, there has I mean, the, um.

298
00:32:51,984 --> 00:32:59,469
The communications department on the website itself, it does indicate the openings and the community.

299
00:32:59,969 --> 00:33:04,733
Look, the communications department has done press releases.

300
00:33:05,253 --> 00:33:06,074
Okay.

301
00:33:06,634 --> 00:33:07,074
Yeah.

302
00:33:07,094 --> 00:33:09,116
So open positions.

303
00:33:11,577 --> 00:33:12,539
I think it's hard.

304
00:33:12,639 --> 00:33:18,130
I think sometimes people apply and then different things happen in their lives.

305
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,282
That caused them to step back.

306
00:33:22,402 --> 00:33:22,822
I think.

307
00:33:23,603 --> 00:33:26,886
A lot of folks that I have spoken to are interested.

308
00:33:27,626 --> 00:33:32,971
But more in a ad hoc basis, and the commission can't move forward.

309
00:33:33,071 --> 00:33:41,419
Like, if I don't know if we're going to have a meeting, because we can't meet quorum, then how do we move forward in in the work that needs to be done?

310
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:57,400
And whilst I want to be as supportive to everyone who applies, it's a labor of love for the applicants.

311
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:05,025
My due diligence is getting the meeting posted in accordance with open meeting law and that kind of stuff.

312
00:34:05,386 --> 00:34:11,350
But it's not calling to remind that we have a meeting coming up.

313
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:13,512
That becomes an additional task.

314
00:34:18,393 --> 00:34:24,338
But I do think that we can, you know, I don't think it's necessary to not meet.

315
00:34:24,458 --> 00:34:26,200
I do think that we can continue.

316
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:41,033
I really want to see the commission's vision of an event at the inclusive playground, you know, take place, even if it's the, you know, if it's the 1st, 1 of its kind there, I think it just makes it more meaningful.

317
00:34:43,571 --> 00:34:50,366
And if we end up being a really small team, then do we partner with

318
00:34:52,230 --> 00:35:01,635
you know, the SPED department and the, you know, and the, for the air transition fair, just so that the work can be shared.

319
00:35:01,655 --> 00:35:06,938
Do we make it like a weekend thing where they do something on one day and we do something on the other day?

320
00:35:06,958 --> 00:35:13,741
I mean, these are just thoughts that I have, but obviously the three of you are passionate about this and which is why you're here.

321
00:35:13,821 --> 00:35:16,483
So I feel like we should still meet anyway.

322
00:35:23,355 --> 00:35:30,417
I would ask for public participation, but we have no members of the public that I can see at this time.

323
00:35:30,857 --> 00:35:33,858
I should probably figure out how to stop sharing my screen too.

324
00:35:35,098 --> 00:35:35,539
There we go.

325
00:35:37,139 --> 00:35:37,839
All right.

326
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:42,441
So does anybody else have anything to add?

327
00:35:47,142 --> 00:35:47,402
Nope.

328
00:35:49,758 --> 00:35:58,601
Just to recap, our next meeting will be a combined meeting for November and December, and it will be on December 4th.

329
00:35:59,861 --> 00:36:12,486
I'm going to check in with the Elections Commission about our polling locations and accessible polling locations and testing of the machines.

330
00:36:14,503 --> 00:36:19,848
I'm also going to check in with the school, avoiding the 1st, 3 days.

331
00:36:24,504 --> 00:36:27,106
of April 12, April 13, April 14.

332
00:36:27,166 --> 00:36:34,030
So looking more towards the very end of April, May-ish time for an 11 a.m.

333
00:36:34,331 --> 00:36:35,251
to 2 p.m.

334
00:36:35,732 --> 00:36:43,537
time slot for having a combined indoor-outdoor event at the accessible playground.

335
00:36:45,998 --> 00:36:48,500
And I think those are my tasks.

336
00:36:52,342 --> 00:36:55,685
All right, everyone, I will be in contact via email.

337
00:36:55,825 --> 00:37:01,689
If you think of something that I should be doing in the meantime, let me know.

338
00:37:01,709 --> 00:37:07,654
Feel free to reach out to either myself or to Nicholas.

339
00:37:07,774 --> 00:37:13,559
As soon as I get a date locked in, I will make sure that I get back to all of you ASAP.

340
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:14,840
Okay.

341
00:37:15,482 --> 00:37:16,688
Thanks, Frances.

342
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:18,155
Thank you all.

343
00:37:18,255 --> 00:37:19,963
It was lovely to see you.

344
00:37:20,385 --> 00:37:21,510
All right, take care.

345
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:21,591
Bye.

346
00:37:21,611 --> 00:37:22,595
Okay, bye-bye.
