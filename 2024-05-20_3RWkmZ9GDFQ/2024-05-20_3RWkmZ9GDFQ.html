    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=570.286s">It's</a>  on the agenda and it's quite long. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=572.486s">I'm</a>  happy to talk about it too, but if you wanna read it, you're welcome to.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=579.402s">Second.</a> </p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=581.023s">Just</a>  to waive the reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=583.345s">Motion</a>  for approval by Member Ruseau, seconded by Member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=588.468s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=589.368s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=590.129s">Okay,</a>  meeting is waived. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=591.549s">If</a>  you could give a synopsis.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=593.411s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=594.331s">So</a>  the, sorry, as I have to take the minutes at the same time, give me just a moment.</p>

    <p>[Robbins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=599.034s">Here</a>  we go.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=604.977s">So</a>  on <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=606.704s">When</a>  did we actually meet on May 8 to discuss the process for doing school handbooks the school committee is required annually by law to approve school handbooks, and we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=619.073s">done</a>  that some years and not done that some or many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=622.516s">So</a>  we worked up a process we reviewed I reviewed, I took some example policy from other districts, notably Cambridge, and worked up a timeline policy that we, the rest of the committee members. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=638.792s">fleshed</a>  out the synopsis is that there's three phases of the handbook process that we would like to see implemented. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=648.956s">The</a>  first phase is the initiation of the handbook update process, which the superintendent's office will manage. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=655.619s">And</a>  there's quite a long date range of August 1st to September 30th for them to accomplish that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=661.801s">Then</a>  those go over to the school council the site camp, school councils excuse me at each of the buildings, and those individual councils one of their required, but one of their tasks as a school council is to draft changes to the handbook, and they get a pretty big. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=679.844s">October</a>  1 to January 31 is the expected time when they would do that work. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=685.008s">And</a>  then finally, this comes back to the school committee for approval sometime between February 1 and April 30. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=690.072s">There's</a>  a whole, there's a lot of language, but those are the most important things, is that there's dates and there's expectations. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=699.28s">And</a>  I think that the big improvement here, aside from having dates, the big improvement is that <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=705.965s">there's</a>  these two memorandums that will accompany these changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=709.606s">So</a>  the laws change every year, court cases, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=715.427s">And</a>  so we often have to update our school handbooks because we don't have a choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=720.567s">But</a>  when the school councils, and I've heard this from school councils, they make these changes and they don't have any idea why. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=728.609s">So</a>  there'll be a memorandum that goes to them explaining exactly why these are changes that you don't really have a choice on. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=736.07s">And</a>  then if the school council wishes to make further changes to the handbooks, you know, things like school pickup at elementary schools, they would also write that up so that when we get the actual handbooks for approval, we're not reading them like <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=751.337s">just</a>  this gigantic set of documents with no idea what changed from last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=756.281s">So</a>  hopefully that will improve the process and make it so that we actually do the approvals. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=762.326s">Because</a>  I mean, all the school handbooks stacked together is quite a thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=766.81s">And</a>  having no clue what changed year to year is, is sort of a monumental task. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=771.174s">So</a>  that's the policy proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=774.596s">The</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=777.138s">We</a>  didn't have administration in the meeting, and that was on purpose, because we wanted to just focus on what the school committee wanted. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=782.74s">So</a>  if the dates do not work for the administration or the school councils, we're certainly happy to hear feedback on that, and adjust those dates. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=793.383s">So</a>  that is the synopsis.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=799.065s">Is</a>  there a motion to approve? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=802.966s">Or</a>  do you want to?</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=806.032s">Motion</a>  to approve first reading.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=808.232s">Motion</a>  to approve first reading by member Rousseau, seconded by?</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=823.295s">Can</a>  I motion to waive the second reading?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=828.056s">Of</a>  the handbook review and schedule, motion to waive the second reading by member Graham.</p>

    <p>[Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=833.992s">Yeah,</a>  we would like to give the administration and school councils a chance to confirm that this works for them.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=841.738s">Oh,</a>  okay, fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=842.859s">Withdrawn.</a> </p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=844.46s">Behavioral</a>  health and special education subcommittee meeting was held on May 15, 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=852.846s">Recommendation</a>  to co-localize Curtis Tufts and the main high school campus. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=858.71s">Would</a>  anybody like to give an update on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=860.512s">Member</a>  Ruseau?</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=861.553s">Certainly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=864.798s">So</a>  the last school committee meeting was the last one, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=867.883s">Actually,</a>  it's in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=871.328s">On</a>  April 29th, not the last school committee meeting, there was a resolution to have the subcommittee discuss the possibility of co-locating the Curtis Tufts with the Medford High School when we are actually re-imagining slash rebuilding Medford High. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=892.146s">And</a>  there were a lot of reasons for that, such as some of the more obvious ones is that <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=897.346s">The</a>  Medford High students not at Curtis Tufts would be in a beautiful facility and the Curtis Tufts is if you've seen it is not exactly that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=905.473s">But</a>  facilities aside, they were all these opportunities that Curtis Tufts students cannot actually participate in or it's very, very difficult to get across town between classes and club participation is low. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=921.489s">At</a>  the last meeting there was also the director of the program in Somerville, and they used to have a separate program like Medford does, and they co located when they built a new Somerville High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=932.541s">And</a>  the reviews were amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=935.943s">You</a>  know, students, their therapeutic learning program are captains of sports teams, participating in all of the clubs. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=944.648s">So</a>  the quality of educational experience for those students went very much through the roof. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=951.912s">So</a>  we listened to, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=955.635s">I</a>  believe it was a survey or just maybe just gathered information from current students, staff were in the meeting of the Curtis Tufts, and the, in my opinion, the unanimous opinion of everyone who participated was that this made sense to make this recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=972.328s">So,</a>  this is the recommendation of the subcommittee that we <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=977.092s">co</a>  locate the Curtis Tufts, at some point, probably when we do the high school over with the main campus.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=987.174s">Great,</a>  thank you for the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=989.074s">Motion</a>  for approval by members so seconded by member of the party. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=993.155s">All</a>  those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=993.915s">I</a>  was opposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=995.875s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=996.235s">We'll</a>  send that to the MSP a subcommittee report of superintendent, Dr. Marice Edouard-Vincent updates and comments.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1007.346s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1016.249s">having</a>  several presentations to recognize some of our student accomplishments. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1020.83s">But</a>  later, after we get through our first additional four reports, we will be presenting the budget update. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1028.812s">During</a>  this presentation, we hope that we are able to answer many of the questions that have come in to the district through email or through direct conversations, specifically regarding the arts and <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1043.855s">change</a>  in programming that is going to be recommended for the arts. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1048.676s">So</a>  I am asking all of you who are here this evening to please let us get through the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1055.779s">And</a>  once we're done with that we'll have a budget update and presentation in time for questions and for us to be able to explain the rationale <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1067.722s">work</a>  that went behind the decisions that did have to be made. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1071.845s">I</a>  can say, just for the purposes of the audience that is here, there have been a lot of questions about no longer having a marching band or anything related to the performing arts, and that is complete misinformation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1088.255s">The</a>  student experience in the Medford Public Schools will be an identical student experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1095.78s">The</a>  one arts related position that was cut was due to a resignation that we received, and that resignation has taken place already. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1108.771s">The</a>  individual has resigned from the district and is no longer employed with Medford public schools, and that was a theater arts position. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1120.2s">cut</a>  without a face or a name. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1123.083s">So</a>  I do want to call that out because there have been many communications about arts programming, ending in midfield, and I deeply, deeply support the arts and so does the entire method public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1138.58s">So</a>  I wanted to just put that information out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1141.963s">and</a>  try to correct some of the misinformation that was spread. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1147.009s">I</a>  do recognize today we have our CCSR update. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1152.815s">Mr.</a>  Trotter will be here with our students and recognize two of our Brooke students, Savannah McLaughlin <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1159.762s">and</a>  Adam Costello who will talk about their special project that they did this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1165.489s">We're</a>  very excited and happy to hear about you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1169.353s">I</a>  want to recognize Dr. Nicole Hughes, our Director of Humanities, who will be recognizing many of our students that have <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1178.504s">performed</a>  a wonderful outstanding achievements over the course of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1182.989s">And</a>  then we will have a high school update from Mr. Brown, the principal of the high school and Mr. Chad found principal director of the vocational school, and Mr. Brown will be discussing the high school survey results. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1198.524s">And</a>  then following those presentations, Mr. Chairman, the director of finance will be presenting a finance update to provide context and additional background, followed by a vote of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1216.747s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Siegel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1398.732s">Hello,</a>  my name is Jonah Siegel. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1401.072s">I'm</a>  part of the executive team of the CCSR at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1405.673s">I</a>  joined the CCSR as a freshman. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1408.474s">And</a>  since then I began a project of river cleanups with my friend Maggie, and we've partnered with the Missick River Watershed Association and held many successful cleanups. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1423.136s">And</a>  we were the youngest ever winners of a Tufts Community Grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1428.117s">for</a>  our effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1429.798s">And</a>  I wanted to talk about how CCSR, what I think is really special about it is how it changes your mindset on leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1438.405s">I</a>  can remember when I was a freshman, and I just joined the CCSR. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1442.508s">When</a>  I looked around and I saw things around me that needed improving, I <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1448.834s">Before</a>  I would just walk and continue about my day, but now I would think about it and I would say, how could I make a CCSR project about this? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1456.637s">How</a>  could I change this? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1458.557s">And</a>  I think that's what's great about the CCSR is it gives you a platform. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1463.319s">It</a>  gives you a resources, not only financial resources and in terms of mentors, but it also gives you a community that really encourages the mindset of just go out and do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1475.463s">Like</a>  be the change you wanna see in the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1478.772s">And</a>  I think that's really special for children to develop, which is why I think it's great that we have this program all throughout the district and the elementary schools and the middle schools and the high schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1490.235s">And</a>  I hope it can continue to expand and be a part of more children's lives, because it's really just a great place for them to learn that they can make a change.</p>

    <p>[Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1790.037s">I</a>  also just wanted to take a second and just recognize how important this program is to our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1795.8s">I</a>  actually, unfortunately, only got a chance to be a part of it my senior year in high school, but that was the cohort that witnessed it go to the elementary and middle school level. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1804.985s">And</a>  just seeing how much it's grown in only what I like to say two years, but it's been like five or six now, is absolutely amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1813.349s">And</a>  I'm so proud of you guys and everyone who's involved to get up here and speak and do what you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1818.872s">This</a>  program really takes you know when you take a moment and look at students special interests and you look at what they want to do to give back to the community and you fund that and you encourage them to do it, you see such an increase in their overall academic success and their participation in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1836.881s">the</a>  social emotional learning skills that you get. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1839.802s">And</a>  I just, I really, you know, seeing what happened and seeing the unfortunate incident that happened and just immediately coming to action and then doing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1847.885s">I</a>  just, I can't commend you guys enough and I can't wait to see what you guys do next. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1852.187s">I</a>  really can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1852.887s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1853.987s">Thank</a>  you so much.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1864.976s">Yes,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1865.656s">I</a>  just want to comment that I feel like I see Jonah more than some of my own children. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1871.819s">Everywhere</a>  I go I see Jonah whether it's in a play or at the State House on May 10 or the ninth. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1878.487s">sixth,</a>  whatever, he seems to always be everywhere, which is sort of what you'd expect from our students who are, and not just Jonah, there are several other students who are also at the Statehouse, and I don't think that's a CCSR project, but you know, they're <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1896.895s">participation</a>  doesn't just start and end with the club times. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1901.541s">And</a>  I think that's really impressive. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1903.303s">I</a>  do wonder how anybody manages that much in their schedule, but thank you for all of your efforts.</p>

    <p>[Haley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1912.668s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1914.089s">I</a>  just want to say thank you again to all of you, you did a wonderful job. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1918.451s">Savannah,</a>  Adam and thank you Jonah as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1921.352s">I</a>  want to thank Mr. Trotter, I know we wouldn't have this program without the generous support of Cummings Foundation and our other partners but the Cummings Foundation truly <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1935.519s">keeps</a>  getting back to Medford, and this is a worthwhile program to continue investing in and so I just want to send another special thank you to them for their continued support of our school programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1947.809s">Thank</a>  you again.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1950.831s">Member</a>  Graham.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1952.752s">I</a>  just wanted to say thank you Adam and Savannah. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1956.471s">Savannah</a>  and I live in the same neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1958.053s">So</a>  and I happen to be home when when attacked place and I happen to be driving by as the police were responding. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1966.02s">So</a>  it was sort of hard to understand what was happening at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1969.363s">But</a>  I sure I'm glad the news media didn't ruin Halloween for us in the neighborhood because that would have been terrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1975.429s">But</a>  thank you both for taking care of our mail carriers. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1977.831s">It's</a>  really important work. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1979.213s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Trotter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1991.207s">Just</a>  before we finish, I just want to mention the fact that the advisor, Michael Coates, couldn't be here because of a family issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1996.791s">And</a>  he does a fantastic job with the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1999.854s">This</a>  is not the first time that he's done an outstanding project with the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2003.977s">And</a>  finally, I'm very proud of the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2007.52s">I'm</a>  very proud of these students. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2009.662s">It</a>  makes me happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2010.783s">I'm</a>  sure it makes you happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2012.104s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2013.685s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2021.072s">We</a>  have number three humanities student recognition, Dr. Nicole Chiesa, Director of Humanities. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2026.355s">Welcome.</a> </p>

    <p>[Chiesa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2038.2s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2040.261s">Thank</a>  you for the opportunity tonight to honor several of our students who have <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2045.953s">really</a>  accomplished so many amazing achievements throughout the year, so we won't bring them all up because we know that would take too much time but we're happy for those that were able to attend tonight we know there are games going on and other things happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2059.82s">And</a>  as I go through the names will ask people to stand so that we can honor them. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2065.376s">slide</a>  by slides. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2067.017s">But</a>  first, I do want to take a moment on the next slide to thank the school committee, to thank Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2073.66s">Cabral,</a>  Mr. Fallon, Mr. Tucci, and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2076.941s">Skane</a>  for supporting these endeavors because we could not do it alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2081.183s">Certainly</a>  for thanking you for funding and supporting us throughout the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2084.945s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2088.413s">So</a>  I'm going to be reading a lot of names. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2090.694s">You</a>  do have the report that you were provided with that explains several of these different endeavors. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2096.717s">But</a>  if there's any questions, I am more than happy to explain anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2102.32s">We</a>  are going to start with the writing achievements, some of the writing achievements. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2106.583s">Certainly</a>  this is not encompassing every achievement of the year, but some of the ones that we haven't had a chance to honor. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2113.536s">And</a>  so we do have the Boston Playwrights Theater's Young Playwrights Project. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2117.905s">Why</a>  don't I read the names and then people could stand after, would that work for the group, the committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2123.399s">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2124.6s">So</a>  for the Boston Playwrights Theater's Young Playwrights Project, we have Michaela Callahan, Mandy Chow, Julia Hanratty, Kian Liu, Jonah Segal, Bethea Pierce, Kira Tramble, Stanley Sunwoo, Becky Wang, and Maria Zara. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2142.037s">And</a>  we wanna thank Mr. Bowen Flynn for supporting the students throughout that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2147.402s">We</a>  were also able to have the Shakespearean monologue competition. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2151.765s">We</a>  had one of our students who's here tonight, Jonah Siegel, who spoke so eloquently, really advanced quite far and Mr. Bowen Flynn and all of us were just so proud of the efforts. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2164.733s">For</a>  Boston Globe Scholastic Writing Award, we have our student here tonight, Christine Dehotel, who received both an honorable mention and a silver key. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2175.536s">She</a>  is a student of Mr. Ambrose, who shared with me today that she has a whole collection of writings. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2180.598s">So</a>  we're very excited to see future works down the line, hopefully. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2185.58s">And</a>  finally, we have the Immigration Learning Center Teen Perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2189.921s">We</a>  had three students from Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2191.222s">Sanford's</a>  class. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2193.021s">receive</a>  awards, Mosamed Habiba, Michael Pak, Madgulat Takele. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2198.204s">So</a>  if we could have the students that were able to come tonight stand and honor them, thank you so much and congratulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2219.895s">And</a>  of course, thank you to their teachers as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2222.813s">The</a>  next slide is our students in action. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2225.136s">So</a>  every year we have the opportunity to have some students go and actually go to different activities where they can engage in government actions. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2236.825s">We</a>  had the MASC Day on the Hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2240.046s">We</a>  had four students attend with Mr. Bowen Flynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2244.027s">And</a>  we also wanted to give a special thank you to the school committee members who took, who were able to attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2249.429s">Committee</a>  member Graham, Reinfeld, and Rousseau, as well as Senator Jalen for supporting the students at the event. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2256.191s">The</a>  students that were chosen for that were Mandy Chow, Ann Dupes, Sierra Isbell, and Jonah Segal. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2262.333s">Segal,</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2264.554s">In</a>  addition to that, and I'm sorry, I know I'm talking fast, I'll slow down. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2268.036s">I</a>  just want to make sure I get through the names. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2271.418s">We</a>  also had students participate in Student Government Day, and we do have pictures up there showing them in action as they attended Government Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2281.464s">That</a>  was Helen Lucas and Noah Urosofsky. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2285.126s">Oh,</a>  sorry, you're Osco, I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2288.17s">And</a>  Mr. Bowen Flynn, who's our English teacher, was able to accompany them, said what a wonderful day it was for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2294.918s">And</a>  we were appreciative of their time as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2297.83s">We</a>  also had the geography be at our middle school, and we had finalists come and attend, and we had some really strong winners come out of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2309.957s">We</a>  shared with you in the narrative some of the questions that they had to answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2314.039s">They</a>  were superb. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2316.66s">So</a>  we did want to take a minute to recognize Joe Hogan, Richard Mongol, <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2322.105s">Stanley</a>  Tong, and Stefano Lazzaro, who achieved first place, Elliot Traber-Hill, who achieved second place, and Emmett Berryman, who achieved third place. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2333.933s">We</a>  are really, really proud of them, really proud of Mr. McCarthy, Mr. Villard, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2339.296s">O'Donohue,</a>  and Mr. Zizzo for supporting them through this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2343.519s">So</a>  all the students who I just named, if they could take a moment, if they're here, and we could maybe congratulate them for such an excellent job well done, that would be wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2368.635s">I</a>  should also mention that they will be receiving certificates within their buildings, just not tonight in the interest of just a lot of wonderful success stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2380.27s">The</a>  next event that we wanted to make sure we recognized were our simulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2385.996s">So</a>  we have a few different groups that engage in various simulations through clubs or through classroom activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2394.906s">And</a>  we begin with our model United Nations. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2397.809s">This</a>  year model United Nations was run by Mr. Matthew Brophy. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2402.093s">And</a>  he did it as more of an after school activity and he accomplished so many wonderful things that I did share with you in the narratives, but we were really proud of him to be able to do this after school as opposed to in class, and he you approved the Dartmouth overnight field trip they had a wonderful time and did quite well. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2423.206s">They</a>  have an amazing team. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2425.187s">I've</a>  put a picture in the background for you, and I'll just read the names through, and hopefully those who are here can be honored. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2433.613s">So</a>  we have Emma Ben-Wi, Man Chow, Shahan Qadri, who did receive an Honorable Mention recipient at one of the simulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2443.199s">Brian</a>  DiPlazido, who received a People's Choice Award. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2447.561s">Jack</a>  Dodd, <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2448.815s">And</a>  oops, Yamilee Etienne, Sierra Godley, Bridget Inman, Sierra Isbell, Mohammed Jamaldeen, Sean Johnson, Margaret Carroll, Leanne Lam, Evan Russell, Kira Tremble, Kiana Tran, Darren Truong, <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2466.943s">who</a>  also received both a Model United Nations Outstanding Delegate and Best Orator recipient, both two awards. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2475.727s">Daviana</a>  Vega, Jaden Ville, Noah Urasco, and Maria Zasra, I'm having trouble tonight, sorry, Zasra, I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2486.332s">They</a>  did an amazing job, love the energy, and a huge thank you to Mr. Brophy as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2490.914s">If</a>  anyone's here tonight, if they'd like to stand to be honored, we would love to congratulate you for all of your efforts. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2511.764s">Okay,</a>  and last but not least, we have our mock trial and our ethics bowl. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2519.053s">Our</a>  mock trial, as you read in the narrative, engaged in multiple trials throughout the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2526.441s">They</a>  were led by our advisor, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2529.305s">Dineu,</a>  and they, <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2532.489s">both</a>  worked in the classroom to prepare for these mock trials, as well as after school, and then were able to really go in, get different points based on their arguments, and achieve some very strong success. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2546.835s">Participants</a>  in mock trial were Michelle Began, Genevieve Blatt, Eric Brown, Michael Koday, Clay Canavan, Nathan Chevalier, Sophia DeMillo, Brian DiPlacido, Gavin Gain, <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2562.932s">DeFord</a>  Guerra, Nathaniel Hopper, Maria Lima Costa, Helen Lucas, Anna Sophia Marrera, Madeline Morris, Theodore Norton, Mark Parr, Tenzin Richen, and Christopher Rothermel. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2581.28s">And</a>  then we had our EPICS Bowl, which I've already presented on before. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2584.962s">And</a>  thanks to your generosity, they did go to nationals. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2588.823s">They</a>  had a wonderful time. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2590.814s">They</a>  performed exceptionally well, as you read. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2595.356s">And</a>  we just wanted to take, again, I know I already thanked you, but we are very appreciative of your support for that trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2602.52s">And</a>  I wanted to read the names of the students who attended. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2605.022s">So</a>  we have Sonia Benapal, Anne Dupes, Andre Duriti, Claire Gingo, Amira Laflam, Carmen Morgante, <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2615.097s">Bahaba</a>  Sahil, and we also have our wonderful advisor, Mr. Esner. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2621.422s">I</a>  also failed to mention in the slide previous to that, for Model UN, the other advisor in addition to Mr. Brophy is Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2628.967s">Gates.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2630.248s">If</a>  you could stand, if you were able to attend, and we could honor you and thank you for all of your hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2655.131s">Thank</a>  you again for your time, for supporting these students, and a huge congratulations to the students, the teachers, and everybody else. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2662.496s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2663.376s">I'm</a>  happy to answer any questions, but yeah, I'm happy to answer any questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2668.459s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2668.76s">Great</a>  presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2670.061s">Congratulations.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2671.001s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Chiesa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2671.601s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2676.565s">I</a>  noticed a few people stood up more than once too, so we'll get some. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2681.069s">Great</a>  students, well-rounded. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2682.51s">We</a>  have our Medford High School update and survey results. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2687.033s">Our</a>  principal, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2688.014s">Manta</a>  Cabral, welcome.</p>

    <p>[Cabral]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2689.194s">Am</a>  I on? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2706.406s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2708.925s">Good</a>  evening, Mayor, members of the School Committee, and Superintendent, Dr. Eduardo Vinson. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2714.07s">It</a>  is hard to believe that in less than two weeks, we'll be wishing our seniors well as they cross the stage to graduate and continue on with post-secondary in our careers. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2723.459s">The</a>  end of the school year is a busy time with exams, events, and celebrations, but it's also a time to reflect on the accomplishments and growth of the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2738.973s">Tonight,</a>  we'll review and highlight the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2741.576s">Specifically,</a>  we'll review the culture and climate survey, share new core values and community norms, highlight the accomplishments of our CTE programs, along with what is next for MHS. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2754.158s">The</a>  Culture and Climate Survey was administered in May of 2023, 2024, sorry, was administered in May of 2023 and again most recently in late April of 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2766.593s">A</a>  total of 711 MHS students in grades 9 through 12 participated in the survey during advisory block. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2774.722s">The</a>  survey is composed of eight categories, cultural awareness and action, diversity and inclusion, school belonging, school climate, school engagement, school safety, student teacher relationships, and valuing of school. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2792.642s">When</a>  presented with the 2022-2023 school year data, MHS identified and shared at a previous school committee member three categories. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2803.313s">The</a>  categories included areas of strength, areas with varied results, and areas for growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2811.283s">In</a>  slides six through eight, I've provided statistical comparison between the two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2816.669s">It's</a>  important to note that Panorama, the survey platform, identifies increases of more than two percentage points as statistically significant, meaning it could have not happened by chance based on our survey size. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2833.587s">I've</a>  identified questions from the survey to share with you tonight and represent areas of strength and continued areas of growth for Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2841.972s">As</a>  shown on slide six, school belonging is how much students feel they're valued members of the school community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2849.437s">In</a>  all three questions, students showed 5% or more increase from the 2022-2023 school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2857.362s">School</a>  engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2858.863s">Students'</a>  attentiveness and investment in school remain stable at 91%. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2862.584s">And</a>  lastly, valuing of school. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2866.465s">How</a>  much students feel that school is interesting, important, and useful showed an increase of between 7 to 9%. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2874.795s">And</a>  slide seven, student-teacher relationships. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2878.157s">Strength</a>  of the social connections between students and teachers within and beyond school. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2885.28s">This</a>  year, I would identify student-teacher relationships as a strength at MHS, with an eight to 10% increase in the five questions shared. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2894.725s">This</a>  is a testament to the dedication of our valued faculty. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2898.988s">School</a>  safety demonstrated a 9-15% shift in the questions identified. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2905.49s">Students</a>  at school feel safe, students at this school get along with each other, students at school threaten to hurt other students, and students at this school fight a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2917.235s">I</a>  consider school safety to remain in the varied results category. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2922.395s">On</a>  slide eight, school climate, overall social and learning climate of the school, this category showed significant growth from the 2022-2023 school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2934.343s">The</a>  questions with the greatest change are, adults at this school reward students for positive behavior, students at this school try to work out their disagreements with other students by talking to them, and school rules and discipline are applied equally and fairly. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2950.819s">Lastly,</a>  cultural awareness and action, along with diversity inclusion, show that they are trending in a positive direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2959.722s">Medford</a>  High School has focused on creating environments where students feel welcomed, supported, and safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2965.724s">We've</a>  made an assertive effort and commitment to hear students and staff voices, and have not only listened, but made changes at MHS to incorporate feedback and suggestions. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2976.488s">We</a>  held more community gatherings to build school spirit and pride. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2980.15s">We</a>  worked together on core values and have continuously incorporated restorative practices into our work with students, along with providing professional development on restorative and tiered model intervention strategies in the classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2994.978s">We</a>  understand that culture and climate shifts at Medford High School will take time, but we're committed to providing an inclusive, safe, and academically rigorous learning environment that our students and staff deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3008.15s">I'm</a>  pleased to see the positive shifts are being made and that growth is noted over an 11th month span between surveys. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3015.616s">Consensus</a>  among educational researchers note a three to five year period for change. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3024.867s">Shifting</a>  to some of the work done this year, together as students and staff, we developed our new core values. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3030.952s">After</a>  conversations and advisory and small group panels, students selected the three core values of respect, responsibility, and empathy and kindness. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3040.659s">For</a>  staff, we held a workshop along with discussion and house meetings and surveys to identify the three shared core values. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3048.945s">Community</a>  norms were developed in January and discussed as a community and advisory. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3053.251s">We</a>  started working on a shared vision, along with a portrait of a graduate. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3059.219s">At</a>  this time, I'm going to pause and I'm going to hand it over to Mr. Fallon to highlight our CTE programs and students.</p>

    <p>[Fallon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3071.237s">Good</a>  evening, Madam Superintendent, Madam Mayor, members of the School Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3074.598s">I'm</a>  going to provide a brief update on career and technical education for this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3079.019s">We</a>  did have 304 students, which was our highest number ever, participate in Freshman Exploratory. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3084.221s">Of</a>  those students, 185 were placed in CTE programs, and 72 students chose a traditional high school pathway. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3091.363s">At</a>  this time, we have 47 students on a wait list. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3094.602s">For</a>  cooperative education, we had 58 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3097.143s">Some</a>  of our stellar juniors who are ready ahead of time are out working and making money. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3102.945s">Over</a>  50 employee partners make up our partnerships now. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3106.807s">Many</a>  of our seniors will continue employment after their graduation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3110.248s">And</a>  two companies that I know of as of this week have offered complete college tuition for these two students that are working. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3116.651s">So</a>  that's exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3119.213s">Some</a>  more updates, if you could click the link. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3121.614s">I've</a>  been talking about the sheds the few times I've been in front of you, and I think that's another good time to highlight what our students can do in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3132.198s">So</a>  we started pretty basic, and as you'll see, the pictures, as they increase, they've become a little bit better each time, because practice makes perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3140.302s">So</a>  that's what we call a man cave at this point, or woman cave. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3145.885s">That</a>  was a shed that they just did recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3147.647s">That's</a>  at the Andrew School. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3148.969s">So</a>  just to give you an idea of our carpentry students, it's our version of a house building project, but a little bit smaller. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3156.42s">In</a>  health assisting, we had seven of our students pass their CNA exam. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3160.182s">We</a>  have one certified dental assistant now. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3163.304s">We</a>  are finding success with the Bunker Hill Community College dual enrollment program, and we're exploring a new partnership for clinical rotations with Winchester Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3171.69s">Our</a>  construction and craft laborer students, the picture on the right, received their hoisting apprenticeship license this past week, and 15 students were inducted into the National Technical Honor Society. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3182.725s">For</a>  our electrical students, two students have been chosen to join the IBEW electrical union. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3188.15s">Nine</a>  students will be entering the workforce as apprentices immediately after graduation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3192.775s">Pictured</a>  in the lower right is a picture of our graphic design program that made the Mustang pride t-shirt for some new swag that can be sold in the Mustang mall. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3203.439s">Two</a>  more things to share with you tonight, one being the biodiesel project that was a collaborative effort between multiple CTE programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3209.521s">So</a>  this all started by collecting waste vegetable oil from culinary. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3213.122s">Biotech</a>  students began the process of converting and using the cooking oil into clean burning fuel. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3218.304s">Then</a>  the students proceeded to learn and master the techniques to how to successfully produce several gallons of refined biodiesel, which burns cleaner than regular diesel fuel. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3227.307s">They</a>  also received a $2,000 grant from the Medford Educational Foundation to help pay for supplies. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3233.01s">Metal</a>  Fab and Auto Tech completed an engine swap of a go-kart, and Business Marketing explored the feasibility of starting a biodiesel production business. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3240.874s">They</a>  also took a field trip to the biodiesel factory, Northeast Biodiesel, which is out in Greenfield, to observe it on a much larger scale. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3249.336s">Coral</a>  Chavez will present our biodiesel project at the MAVA Connecting for Success conference in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3255.021s">Along</a>  with that, if you're in the neighborhood, Friday, we're having an open house of sorts to showcase some of our students' accomplishments this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3261.005s">We</a>  will be highlighting the biodiesel project. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3264.888s">The</a>  last thing I'd like to share, and if members of the team are here, if you could come up and join me, is to honor our robotics team, who has once again, are they here? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3280.461s">So</a>  this is the third year in a row that our students have competed. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3286.984s">Let</a>  me get my notes here. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3288.844s">And</a>  I wanna honor the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3290.025s">So</a>  I'm thrilled to announce that Medford's MVTHS Mate Robotics team has again won the Mate Rove New England Regional Championship. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3296.908s">This</a>  year, they narrowly edged out Phillips Exeter Academy by a score of 445 to 437. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3302.93s">Now</a>  they'll be representing New England at the competition in Tennessee, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3309.793s">I'd</a>  like to honor Tim Hunt, Ben Santana, Miles Hilliard, Scott Campbell, Jonas Wurz, Matt Harris, Aaron Van Daniel, Zach Bertocchi, Franklin Soto-Ortiz, Noah Reed, and Ben Wertz. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3322.993s">Congratulations.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3337.116s">I</a>  never even try to explain anything in engineering and robotics. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3340.557s">I</a>  leave it for the students, so please tell us what you did.</p>

    <p>[Harris]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3343.937s">Hey</a>  there, I'm Matty Harris, member of SecRobotics, obviously, our MVTHS robotics team. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3352.079s">As</a>  we mentioned, we compete in the MATE ROV competition, and so we design underwater robots that are designed to compete in a competition where we perform tasks that mimic real world environmental tasks like <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3365.862s">like</a>  cleaning up, say, trash from the ocean, or finding data on marine life, improving habitats, and stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3379.89s">It's</a>  a really amazing experience, combination of a lot of different disciplines in engineering, hardware, electrical, software. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3389.776s">I</a>  found it to be a really awesome learning experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3393.797s">And</a>  we also like to acknowledge that we couldn't do this without the support of our vocational teachers, Mr. Christie, he spent countless hours with us and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3403.821s">Miller</a>  as well, our programming teacher, and say it's a really great opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3408.942s">I'm</a>  very thankful. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3409.783s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fallon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3420.512s">Also,</a>  I just wanna thank Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3422.054s">Rachel</a>  Perry, who was really good in helping us find some lanes in the pool to test our robots. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3427.4s">So</a>  thank you, Rachel, for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3429.862s">Okay,</a>  back to you, Marta.</p>

    <p>[Cabral]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3433.006s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3435.188s">So</a>  I believe we're on slide 14. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3440.433s">So</a>  alongside school site council for Medford High School and aligned with the district strategic plan we identified this year for strategic priorities for MHS. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3452.381s">and</a>  they're included in the school improvement plan for Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3456.243s">This</a>  plan will span over three years and the four priorities are as followed that we want to improve or to improve student academic and technical achievement. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3466.769s">The</a>  second is to implement practices to ensure a safe, inclusive and supportive school climate and culture for all community members. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3473.873s">Number</a>  three is to improve community engagement and collaboration and routine regular <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3478.915s">and</a>  transparent communications with all stakeholders in Medford, and to create a strategic list of facility needs in order to provide students and staff with clean, safe, and academically conducive learning environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3492.492s">So</a>  those can be found in the school improvement plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3497.307s">On</a>  slide 15, I would like to update on the status of the Welsh report recommendations that were provided last year and that were reviewed at the beginning of this school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3511.701s">For</a>  the first recommendation, a creation of MHS committees were recommended. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3516.924s">There</a>  were a total of four that were recommended to the school and to the committee, them being safety and security team. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3525.369s">We</a>  have implemented this by weekly meetings with our SRO, administration and director of school counseling. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3531.393s">Monthly</a>  meetings are also held with the district attorney's office to discuss support for youth in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3538.584s">Diversity,</a>  equity, and inclusion committee was recommended. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3542.726s">We've</a>  not formalized a committee yet, but we'll have one implemented for the 24-25 school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3548.229s">We</a>  recognize and believe that inclusion, diversity, and equity need to be at the center of our work. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3554.278s">Community</a>  on norms for student behavior, shared values. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3557.66s">This</a>  is something that we decided to do as a whole school and to develop shared norms and shared core values along with as a whole school have a shared vision for next year along with a portrait of a graduate. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3572.509s">And</a>  lastly, the schedule committee, a consultant was hired by MPS and we're continuing to review their recommendations for implementation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3581.328s">The</a>  second recommendation was to provide more opportunities for teachers input and decision making and build relationships between teachers and administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3589.618s">Feedback</a>  is continuously incorporated into all staff meetings, along with processes on how to collect feedback and suggestions throughout the year virtually. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3601.147s">Number</a>  three, parent caregiver surveys about culture and climate and MHS during the 2023 2024 school year, we're currently working on creating this survey and distributing it at the end of the school year to our caregivers and parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3616.249s">Number</a>  four, MHS associate or assistant principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3620.473s">We</a>  did shift administration and we did hire a assistant principal for operations and school and student engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3631.402s">Sorry,</a>  operations and student engagement, who is now part of the administrative team at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3639.008s">Mentoring</a>  for new administrators, new assistant principals attended this year the regional AP conference, and mentoring is continuously provided to APs through both Chad and myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3651.172s">They</a>  also attended workshops and other professional development opportunities offered to APs in our region. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3657.454s">MPS</a>  has also provided me with a coach this year, which has been wonderful through the School Administrator Association. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3668.582s">Lastly,</a>  the last slide is thoughts for the horizon. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3675.606s">Medford</a>  High School, and this is a program proposal that we would like to pilot at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3681.509s">Medford</a>  High School has identified a need for an alternative program for at-risk students who do not qualify for special education at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3689.554s">Currently,</a>  we have the therapeutic learning program, but we're looking at <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3694.056s">piloting</a>  a alternative program within the high school for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3699.5s">These</a>  students are currently not making adequate academic progress and they've been identified, are repeating a grade for the first and or second time, so they're overage, undercredited, and are at risk of dropping out due to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3712.068s">Their</a>  struggles consist of student-related, family-related, school-related, or community-related barriers that we have identified that are hindering their academic progress towards graduation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3722.857s">By</a>  creating an alternative setting, we're able to individualize education, provide supports towards graduation and graduating with their cohort, and we're able to be more flexible in understanding student barriers that are preventing them from making the academic progress that they need in order to graduate on time. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3743.419s">At</a>  this time, we have concluded our presentation, but most importantly, and probably the most exciting part of this time in May is the commencement ceremony that is quickly approaching as our seniors, the class of 2024 are about to graduate. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3761.263s">So</a>  we would like to formally invite you to June 5th at Formel Stadium for the graduation of the class of 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3770.748s">I</a>  thank you for your continued support and if you have any questions or comments, or we could take them offline.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3778.212s">Thank</a>  you for the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3781.674s">The</a>  headliner for me was actually the survey, and while there's lots of good stuff in there, but in the survey data, everything went in the right direction, everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3792.04s">And</a>  I think that's really awesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3801.972s">This</a>  is your first principal ship right first, so I think there's, you should be very proud. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3808.115s">I</a>  mean, one, not even a full school year, and it's, I'm impressed so I just, there's a lot in here that's, we could talk all night about but the survey data I've been waiting with bated breath, and thank you for the great work you've been doing, and I look forward to what you can do in the future.</p>

    <p>[Cabral]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3824.98s">Thank</a>  you, I couldn't do it without the staff and with students this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3828.341s">They've</a>  been extremely supportive and they've really rolled their sleeves up. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3832.242s">The</a>  staff at MHS and and really taking this on with me because it's for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3837.123s">So</a>  I thank them. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3838.283s">I</a>  know there's several in the room, but I really do thank them because I couldn't have done it on my own. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3842.604s">Neither</a>  could chat or the admin team. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3847.385s">Member</a>  Graham and member Bramley.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3850.1s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3850.56s">I</a>  just had a couple of questions about the alternative program proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3855.362s">This</a>  actually came up when we were having some discussions to start to feed some of the work that we have to do for MSBA to describe the kind of programming that happens currently in the building, and then also start to think about what programming would we want to have happen in the building, and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3875.15s">Cabral</a>  brought this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3876.994s">and</a>  I asked her to share her thoughts with all of us so that we could understand sort of the goals here. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3883.341s">So</a>  can you talk a little bit about this, when you think you can do this and the staffing that you think you need in order to do it and any other like barriers that are in your way of helping these students right now?</p>

    <p>[Cabral]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3899.383s">Yes,</a>  so I did propose two models of how it could work. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3903.409s">One</a>  is to have a humanities, to have less staff and have a humanities and a STEM teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3910.498s">And</a>  then the other one is to have four core academics in the classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3916.761s">We</a>  have identified students like I had mentioned that are over age undercredited and there's an urgency to get them through the 10th grade, we know that once we get students through the 10th grade their graduation rate is much higher than if they were to repeat ninth grade or repeat. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3933.351s">twice</a>  ninth grade, which we do have students on track to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3937.014s">So</a>  when it comes to barriers that I have currently, it would definitely be staffing and strategically looking at how that staffing may work in order to best support the students because I don't want to create a program that is not fully supportive of the needs that they they currently need each day. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3955.507s">And</a>  then also space, we would need to look at the space and where that would be best placed within the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3962.873s">I</a>  have lots of ideas for when we reimagine the high school, but there is an urgency right now based off the data that we're presented with, with some of our students that are at risk for dropping out.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3974.402s">And</a>  so do you think that you can start this program next year and <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3982.685s">Is</a>  that reflected in your current scheduling dynamic?</p>

    <p>[Cabral]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3987.347s">So</a>  we're currently still doing the schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3989.969s">I</a>  hope to identify if we can and propose to central office if we do have staffing that would allow for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3998.033s">We</a>  are also at the moment identifying teachers that can provide interventions to all MHS students. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4005.497s">So</a>  it's a little bit of a puzzle piece right now as to if we have the current staffing needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4011.44s">If</a>  we do have the current staffing needed, I would like to take a very small cohort of students and be able to do something and pilot it within this school year, within the coming school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4023.67s">But</a>  it really, I will not know until probably the next two weeks when it comes to that, because I do wanna provide interventions for math and ELA support for all students.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4034.479s">I</a>  just wanna say that this is the kind of strategic <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4039.11s">project</a>  and initiative that the committee has sort of been begging to be put forward from the high school campus. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4045.552s">And</a>  I'm just so happy to hear that we are looking at the data, we are identifying students that are at risk, and we know how specifically to help them and where and when to intervene. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4058.476s">that's</a>  since I have been on the school committee, I have like literally been waiting for this presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4063.479s">So</a>  I'm so happy that it's finally here. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4065.74s">And</a>  it's only been four and a half years, and it's not been a decade. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4069.042s">But</a>  I do want to sort of like we're all here, but this room is full, because we're having a budget presentation soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4075.285s">So</a>  I would like to make a motion that Miss Cabral gets the staffing that she needs to pilot this program next year, no matter what happens with the budget.</p>

    <p>[Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4084.77s">I'll</a>  second that.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4089.901s">Motion</a>  by Member Graham, seconded by Member Bramley. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4093.067s">All</a>  those in favor?</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4094.45s">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4095.933s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4097.696s">Motion</a>  passes.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4099.36s">Thank</a>  you, that's it.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4100.682s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4101.163s">Member</a>  Bramley?</p>

    <p>[Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4104.158s">I</a>  think I may be one of your biggest fans. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4106.801s">I've</a>  said from day one that I thought you were unicorn, I was on the committee to hire you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4110.885s">Remember</a>  Graham was there also there was there was maybe 10 to 15 of us that were in that room when you came into interview, and you walked out and there was this silence. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4122.216s">And</a>  I remember just saying, if all of you don't wanna give her a hug right now, I'm moving. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4127.859s">And</a>  luckily you are still the unicorn and I just can, I don't wanna become emotional. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4132.601s">I</a>  promise I would never cry here. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4133.882s">And</a>  every time, every week I say, I'm not gonna cry. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4137.744s">But</a>  these are happy, happy, this makes me very, very happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4141.066s">I</a>  have really, really pushed for accountability in this district. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4144.707s">I</a>  have really begged for safety, accountability, yes, more than anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4152.096s">I'm</a>  proud of you, I thank you so much, I really do. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4154.778s">You</a>  and Chad are rock stars in my book, so thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4158.4s">I'm</a>  still not gonna cry. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4160.542s">But</a>  I think that there's always still work to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4165.004s">The</a>  amount of emails that we get about day-to-day basis things that are happening in the building still concern me. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4170.788s">I'm</a>  not trying to be a Debbie Downer by any means because I am really Medford's cheerleader here. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4176.552s">But</a>  I just wanna make sure that we don't lose sight of the day-to-day <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4181.215s">things</a>  that are going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4183.556s">The</a>  Welch page was not in our packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4187.098s">Can</a>  we have a copy?</p>

    <p>[Cabral]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4188.459s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4188.919s">Okay,</a>  we'll reshare that that was asked to be added yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4192.601s">So</a>  we added it this morning.</p>

    <p>[Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4194.282s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4195.423s">Awesome.</a> </p>

    <p>[Cabral]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4196.023s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4196.643s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4197.364s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4198.584s">Keep</a>  up the great work.</p>

    <p>[Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4200.421s">Member</a>  Rheintald? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4201.381s">Yeah,</a>  I have a question about the survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4203.902s">So</a>  I was also incredibly encouraged by the numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4207.303s">I</a>  am wondering if there's gonna be any effort to break down particularly cultural awareness and action and diversity inclusion, those questions by some of the more vulnerable populations to see whether the average across the student population may not be representative of those people who are often targeted by some of these challenges. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4225.77s">So</a>  I'm wondering if we can look a little more closely to see <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4230.877s">what</a>  that sub data looks like there.</p>

    <p>[Cabral]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4233.379s">Yes,</a>  I can't agree more. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4234.539s">We</a>  had a very quick turnaround for the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4236.881s">We</a>  really just did like an overall brief summary. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4240.483s">We</a>  really do need to break it down in order to continue making shifts and progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4245.206s">So</a>  yes, that will be done over the summer months to really focus in and hone in on to the work that we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4252.53s">I</a>  agree.</p>

    <p>[Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4253.351s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4253.991s">And</a>  then this might be a question for the superintendent so the Welch report had a lot of focus on the high school on there was also some of this mentoring for other schools in the district and looking at climate, kind of, more broadly across the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4266.68s">And</a>  so I'm wondering what's happening on that front.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4272.987s">So</a>  we are definitely primary focus this year really was the high school to get it up and running and have it be a different experience for and staff within the building which this current survey reflects. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4290.965s">The</a>  broad feedback from the Welsh report, we did not do panorama surveys in the other schools to be able to say this is concrete data, but we do have support for some of the new administrators who did come on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4309.376s">global</a>  context, there has been support and implementation, but the real focus this year for us was the high school to really see this data shift and start to move in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4322.846s">And</a>  we're all very, very pleased that that's what is happening right now.</p>

    <p>[Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4327.369s">Yeah,</a>  absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4328.209s">I</a>  agree completely. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4329.69s">And</a>  I just want to make on record the comment that our, you know, our middle school students are the next high schoolers and elementary. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4336.052s">So</a>  this all this work really has to be district wide. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4339.193s">And</a>  I'm so encouraged by this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4341.154s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4341.834s">And</a>  thanks to everyone who made it possible.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4344.275s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4347.496s">Yes,</a>  our student rep, come on up. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4350.637s">We</a>  have somebody online.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_50]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4357.185s">Yes,</a>  absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4367.658s">Should</a>  be on.</p>

    <p>[Noah]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4371.307s">Well,</a>  I'd just like to say when it comes to the slide on student engagement, especially when it comes to student voice, in my experience, and Darren can certainly speak to it too, the administration's, MHS administration's <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4388.135s">Support</a>  for student voice has definitely, discernibly increased over the past year. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4392.757s">It's</a>  definitely been a big help as we've tried to flesh out our role on the student advisory committee and how we can work to get kids more involved at school. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4400.461s">That</a>  has definitely been, especially thanks to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4403.803s">Cabral</a>  and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4404.423s">Freitas-Haley,</a>  who have worked closely with us to try to get, implement very meaningful changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4409.446s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Darren]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4411.927s">And</a>  just sort of to add off of what Noah said, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4418.567s">When</a>  starting with core values. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4420.649s">I</a>  believe these core values really represent Medford High School as a whole, and just speaking with students and being out in the general student body and I think we've noticed a general positive trends at the high school with student involvement, as well as a student. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4436.897s">students'</a>  well-being and their kind of like will to be in the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4441.399s">We've</a>  worked carefully with Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4442.519s">Cabral</a>  on numerous occasions for some of the events that she mentioned, such as like the pep rally or student risk staff basketball games or other games, as well as on policy making as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4453.903s">She</a>  has really stepped up and allowed us to give her input when it comes to important things that affect students, such as the homework policy, as well as other policies that we are currently working with her.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4468.336s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4469.056s">You</a>  two are involved in everything, just like some of our students that stood up. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4472.318s">So</a>  we appreciate all your involvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4475.699s">And</a>  we do have somebody, one person on. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4478.02s">Chris,</a>  if you could just name your name and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4480.602s">I'm</a>  gonna unmute you right now.</p>

    <p>[Bennett]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4482.623s">Hello?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4492.067s">Yes,</a>  name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4493.227s">My</a>  name is Christine Bennett. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4497.927s">from</a>  19 Martin Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4500.268s">I</a>  just had one quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4501.748s">I'm</a>  hearing about this program that will begin at Metro High that we're aiming for. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4505.689s">Would</a>  that be in place of Curtis Tufts? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4510.49s">The</a>  one we just took a vote on would not. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4512.891s">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4513.931s">You're</a>  welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4517.332s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4518.472s">Thank</a>  you to both of our principals for being here tonight for the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4521.513s">If</a>  there's no further questions, we'll move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4530.666s">I'm</a>  going to read number six and seven we have the budget update by Mr. Gerry McCue director of finance. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4538.292s">Number</a>  five. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4543.69s">career</a>  technical education CTE update Mr. Chad Fallon principal director of medical vocational technical high school and Dr. Peter Cushing assistant superintendent, my apologies.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4555.984s">Can</a>  I just interrupt. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4558.727s">Just</a>  so that the committee knows why these folks are here. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4562.631s">As</a>  we have been planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4565.915s">For</a>  the MSBA work, one of the things that we have to do because we have such a huge vocational school is fill out some documentation around what programs we have, how big they are, and how big we want them to be as we look forward to a new building of some kind. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4582.894s">And</a>  the other thing that this form asks us to do is lay out, if you need programming space for programs that don't exist today, what are those and how much enrollment are you anticipating in these programs that are yet to exist? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4597.338s">And</a>  MSBA goes on to describe a set of requirements around what constitutes something they will entertain. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4603.76s">So</a>  Mr. Fallon and Dr. Cushing have been working hard to articulate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4608.941s">My</a>  hope is that when they are done, we will take a vote here to direct them to continue to explore these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4617.587s">because</a>  that will be needed to send to the MSBA with our chapter 70 or viability plan documentation so that they can sort of consider all of this as part of our sort of input to what ultimately will become a feasibility study. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4633.251s">So</a>  I will turn it over to Mr. Fallon and Dr. Cushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4635.871s">I</a>  just wanted to set that sort of groundwork for everybody else.</p>
