    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=579.402s">Second.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=581.023s">Just</a>  to waive the reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=583.345s">Motion</a>  for approval by Member Ruseau, seconded by Member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=588.468s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=589.368s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=590.129s">Okay,</a>  meeting is waived. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=591.549s">If</a>  you could give a synopsis.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=593.411s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=594.331s">So</a>  the, sorry, as I have to take the minutes at the same time, give me just a moment.</p>

    <p>[Robbins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=599.034s">Here</a>  we go.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=604.977s">So</a>  on <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=606.704s">When</a>  did we actually meet on May 8 to discuss the process for doing school handbooks the school committee is required annually by law to approve school handbooks, and we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=619.073s">done</a>  that some years and not done that some or many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=622.516s">So</a>  we worked up a process we reviewed I reviewed, I took some example policy from other districts, notably Cambridge, and worked up a timeline policy that we, the rest of the committee members. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=638.792s">fleshed</a>  out the synopsis is that there's three phases of the handbook process that we would like to see implemented. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=648.956s">The</a>  first phase is the initiation of the handbook update process, which the superintendent's office will manage. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=655.619s">And</a>  there's quite a long date range of August 1st to September 30th for them to accomplish that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=661.801s">Then</a>  those go over to the school council the site camp, school councils excuse me at each of the buildings, and those individual councils one of their required, but one of their tasks as a school council is to draft changes to the handbook, and they get a pretty big. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=679.844s">October</a>  1 to January 31 is the expected time when they would do that work. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=685.008s">And</a>  then finally, this comes back to the school committee for approval sometime between February 1 and April 30. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=690.072s">There's</a>  a whole, there's a lot of language, but those are the most important things, is that there's dates and there's expectations. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=699.28s">And</a>  I think that the big improvement here, aside from having dates, the big improvement is that <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=705.965s">there's</a>  these two memorandums that will accompany these changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=709.606s">So</a>  the laws change every year, court cases, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=715.427s">And</a>  so we often have to update our school handbooks because we don't have a choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=720.567s">But</a>  when the school councils, and I've heard this from school councils, they make these changes and they don't have any idea why. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=728.609s">So</a>  there'll be a memorandum that goes to them explaining exactly why these are changes that you don't really have a choice on. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=736.07s">And</a>  then if the school council wishes to make further changes to the handbooks, you know, things like school pickup at elementary schools, they would also write that up so that when we get the actual handbooks for approval, we're not reading them like <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=751.337s">just</a>  this gigantic set of documents with no idea what changed from last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=756.281s">So</a>  hopefully that will improve the process and make it so that we actually do the approvals. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=762.326s">Because</a>  I mean, all the school handbooks stacked together is quite a thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=766.81s">And</a>  having no clue what changed year to year is, is sort of a monumental task. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=771.174s">So</a>  that's the policy proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=774.596s">The</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=777.138s">We</a>  didn't have administration in the meeting, and that was on purpose, because we wanted to just focus on what the school committee wanted. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=782.74s">So</a>  if the dates do not work for the administration or the school councils, we're certainly happy to hear feedback on that, and adjust those dates. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=793.383s">So</a>  that is the synopsis.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=799.065s">Is</a>  there a motion to approve? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=802.966s">Or</a>  do you want to?</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=806.032s">Motion</a>  to approve first reading.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=823.295s">Can</a>  I motion to waive the second reading?</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=833.992s">Yeah,</a>  we would like to give the administration and school councils a chance to confirm that this works for them.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=841.738s">Oh,</a>  okay, fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=842.859s">Withdrawn.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=844.46s">Behavioral</a>  health and special education subcommittee meeting was held on May 15, 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=852.846s">Recommendation</a>  to co-localize Curtis Tufts and the main high school campus. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=858.71s">Would</a>  anybody like to give an update on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=860.512s">Member</a>  Ruseau?</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=861.553s">Certainly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=864.798s">So</a>  the last school committee meeting was the last one, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=867.883s">Actually,</a>  it's in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=871.328s">On</a>  April 29th, not the last school committee meeting, there was a resolution to have the subcommittee discuss the possibility of co-locating the Curtis Tufts with the Medford High School when we are actually re-imagining slash rebuilding Medford High. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=892.146s">And</a>  there were a lot of reasons for that, such as some of the more obvious ones is that <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=897.346s">The</a>  Medford High students not at Curtis Tufts would be in a beautiful facility and the Curtis Tufts is if you've seen it is not exactly that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=905.473s">But</a>  facilities aside, they were all these opportunities that Curtis Tufts students cannot actually participate in or it's very, very difficult to get across town between classes and club participation is low. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=921.489s">At</a>  the last meeting there was also the director of the program in Somerville, and they used to have a separate program like Medford does, and they co located when they built a new Somerville High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=932.541s">And</a>  the reviews were amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=935.943s">You</a>  know, students, their therapeutic learning program are captains of sports teams, participating in all of the clubs. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=944.648s">So</a>  the quality of educational experience for those students went very much through the roof. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=951.912s">So</a>  we listened to, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=955.635s">I</a>  believe it was a survey or just maybe just gathered information from current students, staff were in the meeting of the Curtis Tufts, and the, in my opinion, the unanimous opinion of everyone who participated was that this made sense to make this recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=972.328s">So,</a>  this is the recommendation of the subcommittee that we <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=977.092s">co</a>  locate the Curtis Tufts, at some point, probably when we do the high school over with the main campus.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=987.174s">Great,</a>  thank you for the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=989.074s">Motion</a>  for approval by members so seconded by member of the party. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=993.155s">All</a>  those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=993.915s">I</a>  was opposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=995.875s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=996.235s">We'll</a>  send that to the MSP a subcommittee report of superintendent, Dr. Marice Edouard-Vincent updates and comments.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1007.346s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1016.249s">having</a>  several presentations to recognize some of our student accomplishments. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1020.83s">But</a>  later, after we get through our first additional four reports, we will be presenting the budget update. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1028.812s">During</a>  this presentation, we hope that we are able to answer many of the questions that have come in to the district through email or through direct conversations, specifically regarding the arts and <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1043.855s">change</a>  in programming that is going to be recommended for the arts. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1048.676s">So</a>  I am asking all of you who are here this evening to please let us get through the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1055.779s">And</a>  once we're done with that we'll have a budget update and presentation in time for questions and for us to be able to explain the rationale <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1067.722s">work</a>  that went behind the decisions that did have to be made. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1071.845s">I</a>  can say, just for the purposes of the audience that is here, there have been a lot of questions about no longer having a marching band or anything related to the performing arts, and that is complete misinformation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1088.255s">The</a>  student experience in the Medford Public Schools will be an identical student experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1095.78s">The</a>  one arts related position that was cut was due to a resignation that we received, and that resignation has taken place already. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1108.771s">The</a>  individual has resigned from the district and is no longer employed with Medford public schools, and that was a theater arts position. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1120.2s">cut</a>  without a face or a name. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1123.083s">So</a>  I do want to call that out because there have been many communications about arts programming, ending in midfield, and I deeply, deeply support the arts and so does the entire method public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1138.58s">So</a>  I wanted to just put that information out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1141.963s">and</a>  try to correct some of the misinformation that was spread. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1147.009s">I</a>  do recognize today we have our CCSR update. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1152.815s">Mr.</a>  Trotter will be here with our students and recognize two of our Brooke students, Savannah McLaughlin <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1159.762s">and</a>  Adam Costello who will talk about their special project that they did this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1165.489s">We're</a>  very excited and happy to hear about you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1169.353s">I</a>  want to recognize Dr. Nicole Hughes, our Director of Humanities, who will be recognizing many of our students that have <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1178.504s">performed</a>  a wonderful outstanding achievements over the course of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1182.989s">And</a>  then we will have a high school update from Mr. Brown, the principal of the high school and Mr. Chad found principal director of the vocational school, and Mr. Brown will be discussing the high school survey results. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1198.524s">And</a>  then following those presentations, Mr. Chairman, the director of finance will be presenting a finance update to provide context and additional background, followed by a vote of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1216.747s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1790.037s">I</a>  also just wanted to take a second and just recognize how important this program is to our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1795.8s">I</a>  actually, unfortunately, only got a chance to be a part of it my senior year in high school, but that was the cohort that witnessed it go to the elementary and middle school level. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1804.985s">And</a>  just seeing how much it's grown in only what I like to say two years, but it's been like five or six now, is absolutely amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1813.349s">And</a>  I'm so proud of you guys and everyone who's involved to get up here and speak and do what you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1818.872s">This</a>  program really takes you know when you take a moment and look at students special interests and you look at what they want to do to give back to the community and you fund that and you encourage them to do it, you see such an increase in their overall academic success and their participation in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1836.881s">the</a>  social emotional learning skills that you get. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1839.802s">And</a>  I just, I really, you know, seeing what happened and seeing the unfortunate incident that happened and just immediately coming to action and then doing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1847.885s">I</a>  just, I can't commend you guys enough and I can't wait to see what you guys do next. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1852.187s">I</a>  really can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1852.887s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1853.987s">Thank</a>  you so much.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1864.976s">Yes,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1865.656s">I</a>  just want to comment that I feel like I see Jonah more than some of my own children. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1871.819s">Everywhere</a>  I go I see Jonah whether it's in a play or at the State House on May 10 or the ninth. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1878.487s">sixth,</a>  whatever, he seems to always be everywhere, which is sort of what you'd expect from our students who are, and not just Jonah, there are several other students who are also at the Statehouse, and I don't think that's a CCSR project, but you know, they're <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1896.895s">participation</a>  doesn't just start and end with the club times. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1901.541s">And</a>  I think that's really impressive. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1903.303s">I</a>  do wonder how anybody manages that much in their schedule, but thank you for all of your efforts.</p>

    <p>[Jessica Healey]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1912.668s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1914.089s">I</a>  just want to say thank you again to all of you, you did a wonderful job. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1918.451s">Savannah,</a>  Adam and thank you Jonah as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1921.352s">I</a>  want to thank Mr. Trotter, I know we wouldn't have this program without the generous support of Cummings Foundation and our other partners but the Cummings Foundation truly <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1935.519s">keeps</a>  getting back to Medford, and this is a worthwhile program to continue investing in and so I just want to send another special thank you to them for their continued support of our school programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1947.809s">Thank</a>  you again.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1950.831s">Member</a>  Graham.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1952.752s">I</a>  just wanted to say thank you Adam and Savannah. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1956.471s">Savannah</a>  and I live in the same neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1958.053s">So</a>  and I happen to be home when when attacked place and I happen to be driving by as the police were responding. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1966.02s">So</a>  it was sort of hard to understand what was happening at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1969.363s">But</a>  I sure I'm glad the news media didn't ruin Halloween for us in the neighborhood because that would have been terrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1975.429s">But</a>  thank you both for taking care of our mail carriers. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1977.831s">It's</a>  really important work. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1979.213s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Trotta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1991.207s">Just</a>  before we finish, I just want to mention the fact that the advisor, Michael Coates, couldn't be here because of a family issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1996.791s">And</a>  he does a fantastic job with the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1999.854s">This</a>  is not the first time that he's done an outstanding project with the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2003.977s">And</a>  finally, I'm very proud of the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2007.52s">I'm</a>  very proud of these students. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2009.662s">It</a>  makes me happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2010.783s">I'm</a>  sure it makes you happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2012.104s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2013.685s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2021.072s">We</a>  have number three humanities student recognition, Dr. Nicole Chiesa, Director of Humanities. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2026.355s">Welcome.</a> </p>

    <p>[Chiesa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2038.2s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2040.261s">Thank</a>  you for the opportunity tonight to honor several of our students who have <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2045.953s">really</a>  accomplished so many amazing achievements throughout the year, so we won't bring them all up because we know that would take too much time but we're happy for those that were able to attend tonight we know there are games going on and other things happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2059.82s">And</a>  as I go through the names will ask people to stand so that we can honor them. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2065.376s">slide</a>  by slides. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2067.017s">But</a>  first, I do want to take a moment on the next slide to thank the school committee, to thank Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2073.66s">Cabral,</a>  Mr. Fallon, Mr. Tucci, and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2076.941s">Skane</a>  for supporting these endeavors because we could not do it alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2081.183s">Certainly</a>  for thanking you for funding and supporting us throughout the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2084.945s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2088.413s">So</a>  I'm going to be reading a lot of names. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2090.694s">You</a>  do have the report that you were provided with that explains several of these different endeavors. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2096.717s">But</a>  if there's any questions, I am more than happy to explain anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2102.32s">We</a>  are going to start with the writing achievements, some of the writing achievements. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2106.583s">Certainly</a>  this is not encompassing every achievement of the year, but some of the ones that we haven't had a chance to honor. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2113.536s">And</a>  so we do have the Boston Playwrights Theater's Young Playwrights Project. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2117.905s">Why</a>  don't I read the names and then people could stand after, would that work for the group, the committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2123.399s">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2124.6s">So</a>  for the Boston Playwrights Theater's Young Playwrights Project, we have Michaela Callahan, Mandy Chow, Julia Hanratty, Kian Liu, Jonah Segal, Bethea Pierce, Kira Tramble, Stanley Sunwoo, Becky Wang, and Maria Zara. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2142.037s">And</a>  we wanna thank Mr. Bowen Flynn for supporting the students throughout that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2147.402s">We</a>  were also able to have the Shakespearean monologue competition. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2151.765s">We</a>  had one of our students who's here tonight, Jonah Siegel, who spoke so eloquently, really advanced quite far and Mr. Bowen Flynn and all of us were just so proud of the efforts. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2164.733s">For</a>  Boston Globe Scholastic Writing Award, we have our student here tonight, Christine Dehotel, who received both an honorable mention and a silver key. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2175.536s">She</a>  is a student of Mr. Ambrose, who shared with me today that she has a whole collection of writings. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2180.598s">So</a>  we're very excited to see future works down the line, hopefully. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2185.58s">And</a>  finally, we have the Immigration Learning Center Teen Perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2189.921s">We</a>  had three students from Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2191.222s">Sanford's</a>  class. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2193.021s">receive</a>  awards, Mosamed Habiba, Michael Pak, Madgulat Takele. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2198.204s">So</a>  if we could have the students that were able to come tonight stand and honor them, thank you so much and congratulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2219.895s">And</a>  of course, thank you to their teachers as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2222.813s">The</a>  next slide is our students in action. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2225.136s">So</a>  every year we have the opportunity to have some students go and actually go to different activities where they can engage in government actions. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2236.825s">We</a>  had the MASC Day on the Hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2240.046s">We</a>  had four students attend with Mr. Bowen Flynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2244.027s">And</a>  we also wanted to give a special thank you to the school committee members who took, who were able to attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2249.429s">Committee</a>  member Graham, Reinfeld, and Rousseau, as well as Senator Jalen for supporting the students at the event. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2256.191s">The</a>  students that were chosen for that were Mandy Chow, Ann Dupes, Sierra Isbell, and Jonah Segal. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2262.333s">Segal,</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2264.554s">In</a>  addition to that, and I'm sorry, I know I'm talking fast, I'll slow down. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2268.036s">I</a>  just want to make sure I get through the names. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2271.418s">We</a>  also had students participate in Student Government Day, and we do have pictures up there showing them in action as they attended Government Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2281.464s">That</a>  was Helen Lucas and Noah Urosofsky. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2285.126s">Oh,</a>  sorry, you're Osco, I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2288.17s">And</a>  Mr. Bowen Flynn, who's our English teacher, was able to accompany them, said what a wonderful day it was for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2294.918s">And</a>  we were appreciative of their time as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2297.83s">We</a>  also had the geography be at our middle school, and we had finalists come and attend, and we had some really strong winners come out of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2309.957s">We</a>  shared with you in the narrative some of the questions that they had to answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2314.039s">They</a>  were superb. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2316.66s">So</a>  we did want to take a minute to recognize Joe Hogan, Richard Mongol, <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2322.105s">Stanley</a>  Tong, and Stefano Lazzaro, who achieved first place, Elliot Traber-Hill, who achieved second place, and Emmett Berryman, who achieved third place. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2333.933s">We</a>  are really, really proud of them, really proud of Mr. McCarthy, Mr. Villard, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2339.296s">O'Donohue,</a>  and Mr. Zizzo for supporting them through this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2343.519s">So</a>  all the students who I just named, if they could take a moment, if they're here, and we could maybe congratulate them for such an excellent job well done, that would be wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2368.635s">I</a>  should also mention that they will be receiving certificates within their buildings, just not tonight in the interest of just a lot of wonderful success stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2380.27s">The</a>  next event that we wanted to make sure we recognized were our simulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2385.996s">So</a>  we have a few different groups that engage in various simulations through clubs or through classroom activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2394.906s">And</a>  we begin with our model United Nations. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2397.809s">This</a>  year model United Nations was run by Mr. Matthew Brophy. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2402.093s">And</a>  he did it as more of an after school activity and he accomplished so many wonderful things that I did share with you in the narratives, but we were really proud of him to be able to do this after school as opposed to in class, and he you approved the Dartmouth overnight field trip they had a wonderful time and did quite well. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2423.206s">They</a>  have an amazing team. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2425.187s">I've</a>  put a picture in the background for you, and I'll just read the names through, and hopefully those who are here can be honored. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2433.613s">So</a>  we have Emma Ben-Wi, Man Chow, Shahan Qadri, who did receive an Honorable Mention recipient at one of the simulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2443.199s">Brian</a>  DiPlazido, who received a People's Choice Award. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2447.561s">Jack</a>  Dodd, <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2448.815s">And</a>  oops, Yamilee Etienne, Sierra Godley, Bridget Inman, Sierra Isbell, Mohammed Jamaldeen, Sean Johnson, Margaret Carroll, Leanne Lam, Evan Russell, Kira Tremble, Kiana Tran, Darren Truong, <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2466.943s">who</a>  also received both a Model United Nations Outstanding Delegate and Best Orator recipient, both two awards. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2475.727s">Daviana</a>  Vega, Jaden Ville, Noah Urasco, and Maria Zasra, I'm having trouble tonight, sorry, Zasra, I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2486.332s">They</a>  did an amazing job, love the energy, and a huge thank you to Mr. Brophy as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2490.914s">If</a>  anyone's here tonight, if they'd like to stand to be honored, we would love to congratulate you for all of your efforts. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2511.764s">Okay,</a>  and last but not least, we have our mock trial and our ethics bowl. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2519.053s">Our</a>  mock trial, as you read in the narrative, engaged in multiple trials throughout the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2526.441s">They</a>  were led by our advisor, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2529.305s">Dineu,</a>  and they, <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2532.489s">both</a>  worked in the classroom to prepare for these mock trials, as well as after school, and then were able to really go in, get different points based on their arguments, and achieve some very strong success. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2546.835s">Participants</a>  in mock trial were Michelle Began, Genevieve Blatt, Eric Brown, Michael Koday, Clay Canavan, Nathan Chevalier, Sophia DeMillo, Brian DiPlacido, Gavin Gain, <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2562.932s">DeFord</a>  Guerra, Nathaniel Hopper, Maria Lima Costa, Helen Lucas, Anna Sophia Marrera, Madeline Morris, Theodore Norton, Mark Parr, Tenzin Richen, and Christopher Rothermel. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2581.28s">And</a>  then we had our EPICS Bowl, which I've already presented on before. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2584.962s">And</a>  thanks to your generosity, they did go to nationals. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2588.823s">They</a>  had a wonderful time. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2590.814s">They</a>  performed exceptionally well, as you read. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2595.356s">And</a>  we just wanted to take, again, I know I already thanked you, but we are very appreciative of your support for that trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2602.52s">And</a>  I wanted to read the names of the students who attended. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2605.022s">So</a>  we have Sonia Benapal, Anne Dupes, Andre Duriti, Claire Gingo, Amira Laflam, Carmen Morgante, <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2615.097s">Bahaba</a>  Sahil, and we also have our wonderful advisor, Mr. Esner. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2621.422s">I</a>  also failed to mention in the slide previous to that, for Model UN, the other advisor in addition to Mr. Brophy is Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2628.967s">Gates.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2630.248s">If</a>  you could stand, if you were able to attend, and we could honor you and thank you for all of your hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2655.131s">Thank</a>  you again for your time, for supporting these students, and a huge congratulations to the students, the teachers, and everybody else. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2662.496s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2663.376s">I'm</a>  happy to answer any questions, but yeah, I'm happy to answer any questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2668.459s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2668.76s">Great</a>  presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2670.061s">Congratulations.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2671.001s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Chiesa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2671.601s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2676.565s">I</a>  noticed a few people stood up more than once too, so we'll get some. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2681.069s">Great</a>  students, well-rounded. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2682.51s">We</a>  have our Medford High School update and survey results. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2687.033s">Our</a>  principal, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2688.014s">Manta</a>  Cabral, welcome.</p>

    <p>[Cabral]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2689.194s">Am</a>  I on? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2706.406s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2708.925s">Good</a>  evening, Mayor, members of the School Committee, and Superintendent, Dr. Eduardo Vinson. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2714.07s">It</a>  is hard to believe that in less than two weeks, we'll be wishing our seniors well as they cross the stage to graduate and continue on with post-secondary in our careers. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2723.459s">The</a>  end of the school year is a busy time with exams, events, and celebrations, but it's also a time to reflect on the accomplishments and growth of the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2738.973s">Tonight,</a>  we'll review and highlight the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2741.576s">Specifically,</a>  we'll review the culture and climate survey, share new core values and community norms, highlight the accomplishments of our CTE programs, along with what is next for MHS. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2754.158s">The</a>  Culture and Climate Survey was administered in May of 2023, 2024, sorry, was administered in May of 2023 and again most recently in late April of 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2766.593s">A</a>  total of 711 MHS students in grades 9 through 12 participated in the survey during advisory block. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2774.722s">The</a>  survey is composed of eight categories, cultural awareness and action, diversity and inclusion, school belonging, school climate, school engagement, school safety, student teacher relationships, and valuing of school. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2792.642s">When</a>  presented with the 2022-2023 school year data, MHS identified and shared at a previous school committee member three categories. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2803.313s">The</a>  categories included areas of strength, areas with varied results, and areas for growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2811.283s">In</a>  slides six through eight, I've provided statistical comparison between the two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2816.669s">It's</a>  important to note that Panorama, the survey platform, identifies increases of more than two percentage points as statistically significant, meaning it could have not happened by chance based on our survey size. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2833.587s">I've</a>  identified questions from the survey to share with you tonight and represent areas of strength and continued areas of growth for Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2841.972s">As</a>  shown on slide six, school belonging is how much students feel they're valued members of the school community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2849.437s">In</a>  all three questions, students showed 5% or more increase from the 2022-2023 school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2857.362s">School</a>  engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2858.863s">Students'</a>  attentiveness and investment in school remain stable at 91%. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2862.584s">And</a>  lastly, valuing of school. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2866.465s">How</a>  much students feel that school is interesting, important, and useful showed an increase of between 7 to 9%. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2874.795s">And</a>  slide seven, student-teacher relationships. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2878.157s">Strength</a>  of the social connections between students and teachers within and beyond school. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2885.28s">This</a>  year, I would identify student-teacher relationships as a strength at MHS, with an eight to 10% increase in the five questions shared. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2894.725s">This</a>  is a testament to the dedication of our valued faculty. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2898.988s">School</a>  safety demonstrated a 9-15% shift in the questions identified. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2905.49s">Students</a>  at school feel safe, students at this school get along with each other, students at school threaten to hurt other students, and students at this school fight a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2917.235s">I</a>  consider school safety to remain in the varied results category. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2922.395s">On</a>  slide eight, school climate, overall social and learning climate of the school, this category showed significant growth from the 2022-2023 school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2934.343s">The</a>  questions with the greatest change are, adults at this school reward students for positive behavior, students at this school try to work out their disagreements with other students by talking to them, and school rules and discipline are applied equally and fairly. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2950.819s">Lastly,</a>  cultural awareness and action, along with diversity inclusion, show that they are trending in a positive direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2959.722s">Medford</a>  High School has focused on creating environments where students feel welcomed, supported, and safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2965.724s">We've</a>  made an assertive effort and commitment to hear students and staff voices, and have not only listened, but made changes at MHS to incorporate feedback and suggestions. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2976.488s">We</a>  held more community gatherings to build school spirit and pride. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2980.15s">We</a>  worked together on core values and have continuously incorporated restorative practices into our work with students, along with providing professional development on restorative and tiered model intervention strategies in the classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=2994.978s">We</a>  understand that culture and climate shifts at Medford High School will take time, but we're committed to providing an inclusive, safe, and academically rigorous learning environment that our students and staff deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3008.15s">I'm</a>  pleased to see the positive shifts are being made and that growth is noted over an 11th month span between surveys. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3015.616s">Consensus</a>  among educational researchers note a three to five year period for change. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3024.867s">Shifting</a>  to some of the work done this year, together as students and staff, we developed our new core values. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3030.952s">After</a>  conversations and advisory and small group panels, students selected the three core values of respect, responsibility, and empathy and kindness. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3040.659s">For</a>  staff, we held a workshop along with discussion and house meetings and surveys to identify the three shared core values. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3048.945s">Community</a>  norms were developed in January and discussed as a community and advisory. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3053.251s">We</a>  started working on a shared vision, along with a portrait of a graduate. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3059.219s">At</a>  this time, I'm going to pause and I'm going to hand it over to Mr. Fallon to highlight our CTE programs and students.</p>

    <p>[Chad Fallon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3071.237s">Good</a>  evening, Madam Superintendent, Madam Mayor, members of the School Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3074.598s">I'm</a>  going to provide a brief update on career and technical education for this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3079.019s">We</a>  did have 304 students, which was our highest number ever, participate in Freshman Exploratory. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3084.221s">Of</a>  those students, 185 were placed in CTE programs, and 72 students chose a traditional high school pathway. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3091.363s">At</a>  this time, we have 47 students on a wait list. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3094.602s">For</a>  cooperative education, we had 58 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3097.143s">Some</a>  of our stellar juniors who are ready ahead of time are out working and making money. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3102.945s">Over</a>  50 employee partners make up our partnerships now. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3106.807s">Many</a>  of our seniors will continue employment after their graduation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3110.248s">And</a>  two companies that I know of as of this week have offered complete college tuition for these two students that are working. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3116.651s">So</a>  that's exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3119.213s">Some</a>  more updates, if you could click the link. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3121.614s">I've</a>  been talking about the sheds the few times I've been in front of you, and I think that's another good time to highlight what our students can do in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3132.198s">So</a>  we started pretty basic, and as you'll see, the pictures, as they increase, they've become a little bit better each time, because practice makes perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3140.302s">So</a>  that's what we call a man cave at this point, or woman cave. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3145.885s">That</a>  was a shed that they just did recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3147.647s">That's</a>  at the Andrew School. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3148.969s">So</a>  just to give you an idea of our carpentry students, it's our version of a house building project, but a little bit smaller. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3156.42s">In</a>  health assisting, we had seven of our students pass their CNA exam. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3160.182s">We</a>  have one certified dental assistant now. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3163.304s">We</a>  are finding success with the Bunker Hill Community College dual enrollment program, and we're exploring a new partnership for clinical rotations with Winchester Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3171.69s">Our</a>  construction and craft laborer students, the picture on the right, received their hoisting apprenticeship license this past week, and 15 students were inducted into the National Technical Honor Society. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3182.725s">For</a>  our electrical students, two students have been chosen to join the IBEW electrical union. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3188.15s">Nine</a>  students will be entering the workforce as apprentices immediately after graduation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3192.775s">Pictured</a>  in the lower right is a picture of our graphic design program that made the Mustang pride t-shirt for some new swag that can be sold in the Mustang mall. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3203.439s">Two</a>  more things to share with you tonight, one being the biodiesel project that was a collaborative effort between multiple CTE programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3209.521s">So</a>  this all started by collecting waste vegetable oil from culinary. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3213.122s">Biotech</a>  students began the process of converting and using the cooking oil into clean burning fuel. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3218.304s">Then</a>  the students proceeded to learn and master the techniques to how to successfully produce several gallons of refined biodiesel, which burns cleaner than regular diesel fuel. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3227.307s">They</a>  also received a $2,000 grant from the Medford Educational Foundation to help pay for supplies. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3233.01s">Metal</a>  Fab and Auto Tech completed an engine swap of a go-kart, and Business Marketing explored the feasibility of starting a biodiesel production business. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3240.874s">They</a>  also took a field trip to the biodiesel factory, Northeast Biodiesel, which is out in Greenfield, to observe it on a much larger scale. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3249.336s">Coral</a>  Chavez will present our biodiesel project at the MAVA Connecting for Success conference in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3255.021s">Along</a>  with that, if you're in the neighborhood, Friday, we're having an open house of sorts to showcase some of our students' accomplishments this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3261.005s">We</a>  will be highlighting the biodiesel project. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3264.888s">The</a>  last thing I'd like to share, and if members of the team are here, if you could come up and join me, is to honor our robotics team, who has once again, are they here? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3280.461s">So</a>  this is the third year in a row that our students have competed. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3286.984s">Let</a>  me get my notes here. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3288.844s">And</a>  I wanna honor the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3290.025s">So</a>  I'm thrilled to announce that Medford's MVTHS Mate Robotics team has again won the Mate Rove New England Regional Championship. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3296.908s">This</a>  year, they narrowly edged out Phillips Exeter Academy by a score of 445 to 437. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3302.93s">Now</a>  they'll be representing New England at the competition in Tennessee, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3309.793s">I'd</a>  like to honor Tim Hunt, Ben Santana, Miles Hilliard, Scott Campbell, Jonas Wurz, Matt Harris, Aaron Van Daniel, Zach Bertocchi, Franklin Soto-Ortiz, Noah Reed, and Ben Wertz. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3322.993s">Congratulations.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3337.116s">I</a>  never even try to explain anything in engineering and robotics. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3340.557s">I</a>  leave it for the students, so please tell us what you did.</p>

    <p>[Harris]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3343.937s">Hey</a>  there, I'm Matty Harris, member of SecRobotics, obviously, our MVTHS robotics team. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3352.079s">As</a>  we mentioned, we compete in the MATE ROV competition, and so we design underwater robots that are designed to compete in a competition where we perform tasks that mimic real world environmental tasks like <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3365.862s">like</a>  cleaning up, say, trash from the ocean, or finding data on marine life, improving habitats, and stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3379.89s">It's</a>  a really amazing experience, combination of a lot of different disciplines in engineering, hardware, electrical, software. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3389.776s">I</a>  found it to be a really awesome learning experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3393.797s">And</a>  we also like to acknowledge that we couldn't do this without the support of our vocational teachers, Mr. Christie, he spent countless hours with us and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3403.821s">Miller</a>  as well, our programming teacher, and say it's a really great opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3408.942s">I'm</a>  very thankful. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3409.783s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Chad Fallon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3420.512s">Also,</a>  I just wanna thank Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3422.054s">Rachel</a>  Perry, who was really good in helping us find some lanes in the pool to test our robots. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3427.4s">So</a>  thank you, Rachel, for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3429.862s">Okay,</a>  back to you, Marta.</p>

    <p>[Cabral]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3433.006s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3435.188s">So</a>  I believe we're on slide 14. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3440.433s">So</a>  alongside school site council for Medford High School and aligned with the district strategic plan we identified this year for strategic priorities for MHS. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3452.381s">and</a>  they're included in the school improvement plan for Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3456.243s">This</a>  plan will span over three years and the four priorities are as followed that we want to improve or to improve student academic and technical achievement. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3466.769s">The</a>  second is to implement practices to ensure a safe, inclusive and supportive school climate and culture for all community members. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3473.873s">Number</a>  three is to improve community engagement and collaboration and routine regular <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3478.915s">and</a>  transparent communications with all stakeholders in Medford, and to create a strategic list of facility needs in order to provide students and staff with clean, safe, and academically conducive learning environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3492.492s">So</a>  those can be found in the school improvement plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3497.307s">On</a>  slide 15, I would like to update on the status of the Welsh report recommendations that were provided last year and that were reviewed at the beginning of this school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3511.701s">For</a>  the first recommendation, a creation of MHS committees were recommended. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3516.924s">There</a>  were a total of four that were recommended to the school and to the committee, them being safety and security team. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3525.369s">We</a>  have implemented this by weekly meetings with our SRO, administration and director of school counseling. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3531.393s">Monthly</a>  meetings are also held with the district attorney's office to discuss support for youth in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3538.584s">Diversity,</a>  equity, and inclusion committee was recommended. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3542.726s">We've</a>  not formalized a committee yet, but we'll have one implemented for the 24-25 school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3548.229s">We</a>  recognize and believe that inclusion, diversity, and equity need to be at the center of our work. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3554.278s">Community</a>  on norms for student behavior, shared values. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3557.66s">This</a>  is something that we decided to do as a whole school and to develop shared norms and shared core values along with as a whole school have a shared vision for next year along with a portrait of a graduate. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3572.509s">And</a>  lastly, the schedule committee, a consultant was hired by MPS and we're continuing to review their recommendations for implementation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3581.328s">The</a>  second recommendation was to provide more opportunities for teachers input and decision making and build relationships between teachers and administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3589.618s">Feedback</a>  is continuously incorporated into all staff meetings, along with processes on how to collect feedback and suggestions throughout the year virtually. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3601.147s">Number</a>  three, parent caregiver surveys about culture and climate and MHS during the 2023 2024 school year, we're currently working on creating this survey and distributing it at the end of the school year to our caregivers and parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3616.249s">Number</a>  four, MHS associate or assistant principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3620.473s">We</a>  did shift administration and we did hire a assistant principal for operations and school and student engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3631.402s">Sorry,</a>  operations and student engagement, who is now part of the administrative team at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3639.008s">Mentoring</a>  for new administrators, new assistant principals attended this year the regional AP conference, and mentoring is continuously provided to APs through both Chad and myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3651.172s">They</a>  also attended workshops and other professional development opportunities offered to APs in our region. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3657.454s">MPS</a>  has also provided me with a coach this year, which has been wonderful through the School Administrator Association. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3668.582s">Lastly,</a>  the last slide is thoughts for the horizon. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3675.606s">Medford</a>  High School, and this is a program proposal that we would like to pilot at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3681.509s">Medford</a>  High School has identified a need for an alternative program for at-risk students who do not qualify for special education at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3689.554s">Currently,</a>  we have the therapeutic learning program, but we're looking at <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3694.056s">piloting</a>  a alternative program within the high school for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3699.5s">These</a>  students are currently not making adequate academic progress and they've been identified, are repeating a grade for the first and or second time, so they're overage, undercredited, and are at risk of dropping out due to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3712.068s">Their</a>  struggles consist of student-related, family-related, school-related, or community-related barriers that we have identified that are hindering their academic progress towards graduation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3722.857s">By</a>  creating an alternative setting, we're able to individualize education, provide supports towards graduation and graduating with their cohort, and we're able to be more flexible in understanding student barriers that are preventing them from making the academic progress that they need in order to graduate on time. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3743.419s">At</a>  this time, we have concluded our presentation, but most importantly, and probably the most exciting part of this time in May is the commencement ceremony that is quickly approaching as our seniors, the class of 2024 are about to graduate. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3761.263s">So</a>  we would like to formally invite you to June 5th at Formel Stadium for the graduation of the class of 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3770.748s">I</a>  thank you for your continued support and if you have any questions or comments, or we could take them offline.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3778.212s">Thank</a>  you for the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3781.674s">The</a>  headliner for me was actually the survey, and while there's lots of good stuff in there, but in the survey data, everything went in the right direction, everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3792.04s">And</a>  I think that's really awesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3801.972s">This</a>  is your first principal ship right first, so I think there's, you should be very proud. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3808.115s">I</a>  mean, one, not even a full school year, and it's, I'm impressed so I just, there's a lot in here that's, we could talk all night about but the survey data I've been waiting with bated breath, and thank you for the great work you've been doing, and I look forward to what you can do in the future.</p>

    <p>[Cabral]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3824.98s">Thank</a>  you, I couldn't do it without the staff and with students this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3828.341s">They've</a>  been extremely supportive and they've really rolled their sleeves up. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3832.242s">The</a>  staff at MHS and and really taking this on with me because it's for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3837.123s">So</a>  I thank them. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3838.283s">I</a>  know there's several in the room, but I really do thank them because I couldn't have done it on my own. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3842.604s">Neither</a>  could chat or the admin team. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3847.385s">Member</a>  Graham and member Bramley.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3850.1s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3850.56s">I</a>  just had a couple of questions about the alternative program proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3855.362s">This</a>  actually came up when we were having some discussions to start to feed some of the work that we have to do for MSBA to describe the kind of programming that happens currently in the building, and then also start to think about what programming would we want to have happen in the building, and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3875.15s">Cabral</a>  brought this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3876.994s">and</a>  I asked her to share her thoughts with all of us so that we could understand sort of the goals here. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3883.341s">So</a>  can you talk a little bit about this, when you think you can do this and the staffing that you think you need in order to do it and any other like barriers that are in your way of helping these students right now?</p>

    <p>[Cabral]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3899.383s">Yes,</a>  so I did propose two models of how it could work. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3903.409s">One</a>  is to have a humanities, to have less staff and have a humanities and a STEM teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3910.498s">And</a>  then the other one is to have four core academics in the classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3916.761s">We</a>  have identified students like I had mentioned that are over age undercredited and there's an urgency to get them through the 10th grade, we know that once we get students through the 10th grade their graduation rate is much higher than if they were to repeat ninth grade or repeat. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3933.351s">twice</a>  ninth grade, which we do have students on track to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3937.014s">So</a>  when it comes to barriers that I have currently, it would definitely be staffing and strategically looking at how that staffing may work in order to best support the students because I don't want to create a program that is not fully supportive of the needs that they they currently need each day. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3955.507s">And</a>  then also space, we would need to look at the space and where that would be best placed within the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3962.873s">I</a>  have lots of ideas for when we reimagine the high school, but there is an urgency right now based off the data that we're presented with, with some of our students that are at risk for dropping out.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3974.402s">And</a>  so do you think that you can start this program next year and <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3982.685s">Is</a>  that reflected in your current scheduling dynamic?</p>

    <p>[Cabral]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3987.347s">So</a>  we're currently still doing the schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3989.969s">I</a>  hope to identify if we can and propose to central office if we do have staffing that would allow for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3998.033s">We</a>  are also at the moment identifying teachers that can provide interventions to all MHS students. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4005.497s">So</a>  it's a little bit of a puzzle piece right now as to if we have the current staffing needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4011.44s">If</a>  we do have the current staffing needed, I would like to take a very small cohort of students and be able to do something and pilot it within this school year, within the coming school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4023.67s">But</a>  it really, I will not know until probably the next two weeks when it comes to that, because I do wanna provide interventions for math and ELA support for all students.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4034.479s">I</a>  just wanna say that this is the kind of strategic <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4039.11s">project</a>  and initiative that the committee has sort of been begging to be put forward from the high school campus. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4045.552s">And</a>  I'm just so happy to hear that we are looking at the data, we are identifying students that are at risk, and we know how specifically to help them and where and when to intervene. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4058.476s">that's</a>  since I have been on the school committee, I have like literally been waiting for this presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4063.479s">So</a>  I'm so happy that it's finally here. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4065.74s">And</a>  it's only been four and a half years, and it's not been a decade. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4069.042s">But</a>  I do want to sort of like we're all here, but this room is full, because we're having a budget presentation soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4075.285s">So</a>  I would like to make a motion that Miss Cabral gets the staffing that she needs to pilot this program next year, no matter what happens with the budget.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4084.77s">I'll</a>  second that.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4089.901s">Motion</a>  by Member Graham, seconded by Member Bramley. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4093.067s">All</a>  those in favor?</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4094.45s">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4095.933s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4097.696s">Motion</a>  passes.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4099.36s">Thank</a>  you, that's it.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4100.682s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4101.163s">Member</a>  Bramley?</p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4104.158s">I</a>  think I may be one of your biggest fans. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4106.801s">I've</a>  said from day one that I thought you were unicorn, I was on the committee to hire you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4110.885s">Remember</a>  Graham was there also there was there was maybe 10 to 15 of us that were in that room when you came into interview, and you walked out and there was this silence. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4122.216s">And</a>  I remember just saying, if all of you don't wanna give her a hug right now, I'm moving. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4127.859s">And</a>  luckily you are still the unicorn and I just can, I don't wanna become emotional. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4132.601s">I</a>  promise I would never cry here. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4133.882s">And</a>  every time, every week I say, I'm not gonna cry. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4137.744s">But</a>  these are happy, happy, this makes me very, very happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4141.066s">I</a>  have really, really pushed for accountability in this district. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4144.707s">I</a>  have really begged for safety, accountability, yes, more than anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4152.096s">I'm</a>  proud of you, I thank you so much, I really do. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4154.778s">You</a>  and Chad are rock stars in my book, so thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4158.4s">I'm</a>  still not gonna cry. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4160.542s">But</a>  I think that there's always still work to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4165.004s">The</a>  amount of emails that we get about day-to-day basis things that are happening in the building still concern me. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4170.788s">I'm</a>  not trying to be a Debbie Downer by any means because I am really Medford's cheerleader here. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4176.552s">But</a>  I just wanna make sure that we don't lose sight of the day-to-day <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4181.215s">things</a>  that are going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4183.556s">The</a>  Welch page was not in our packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4187.098s">Can</a>  we have a copy?</p>

    <p>[Cabral]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4188.459s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4188.919s">Okay,</a>  we'll reshare that that was asked to be added yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4192.601s">So</a>  we added it this morning.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4194.282s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4195.423s">Awesome.</a> </p>

    <p>[Cabral]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4196.023s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4196.643s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4197.364s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4198.584s">Keep</a>  up the great work.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4200.421s">Member</a>  Rheintald? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4201.381s">Yeah,</a>  I have a question about the survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4203.902s">So</a>  I was also incredibly encouraged by the numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4207.303s">I</a>  am wondering if there's gonna be any effort to break down particularly cultural awareness and action and diversity inclusion, those questions by some of the more vulnerable populations to see whether the average across the student population may not be representative of those people who are often targeted by some of these challenges. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4225.77s">So</a>  I'm wondering if we can look a little more closely to see <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4230.877s">what</a>  that sub data looks like there.</p>

    <p>[Cabral]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4233.379s">Yes,</a>  I can't agree more. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4234.539s">We</a>  had a very quick turnaround for the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4236.881s">We</a>  really just did like an overall brief summary. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4240.483s">We</a>  really do need to break it down in order to continue making shifts and progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4245.206s">So</a>  yes, that will be done over the summer months to really focus in and hone in on to the work that we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4252.53s">I</a>  agree.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4253.351s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4253.991s">And</a>  then this might be a question for the superintendent so the Welch report had a lot of focus on the high school on there was also some of this mentoring for other schools in the district and looking at climate, kind of, more broadly across the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4266.68s">And</a>  so I'm wondering what's happening on that front.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4272.987s">So</a>  we are definitely primary focus this year really was the high school to get it up and running and have it be a different experience for and staff within the building which this current survey reflects. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4290.965s">The</a>  broad feedback from the Welsh report, we did not do panorama surveys in the other schools to be able to say this is concrete data, but we do have support for some of the new administrators who did come on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4309.376s">global</a>  context, there has been support and implementation, but the real focus this year for us was the high school to really see this data shift and start to move in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4322.846s">And</a>  we're all very, very pleased that that's what is happening right now.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4327.369s">Yeah,</a>  absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4328.209s">I</a>  agree completely. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4329.69s">And</a>  I just want to make on record the comment that our, you know, our middle school students are the next high schoolers and elementary. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4336.052s">So</a>  this all this work really has to be district wide. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4339.193s">And</a>  I'm so encouraged by this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4341.154s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4341.834s">And</a>  thanks to everyone who made it possible.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4344.275s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4347.496s">Yes,</a>  our student rep, come on up. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4350.637s">We</a>  have somebody online.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_50]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4357.185s">Yes,</a>  absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4367.658s">Should</a>  be on.</p>

    <p>[Noah]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4371.307s">Well,</a>  I'd just like to say when it comes to the slide on student engagement, especially when it comes to student voice, in my experience, and Darren can certainly speak to it too, the administration's, MHS administration's <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4388.135s">Support</a>  for student voice has definitely, discernibly increased over the past year. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4392.757s">It's</a>  definitely been a big help as we've tried to flesh out our role on the student advisory committee and how we can work to get kids more involved at school. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4400.461s">That</a>  has definitely been, especially thanks to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4403.803s">Cabral</a>  and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4404.423s">Freitas-Haley,</a>  who have worked closely with us to try to get, implement very meaningful changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4409.446s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Darren Truong]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4411.927s">And</a>  just sort of to add off of what Noah said, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4418.567s">When</a>  starting with core values. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4420.649s">I</a>  believe these core values really represent Medford High School as a whole, and just speaking with students and being out in the general student body and I think we've noticed a general positive trends at the high school with student involvement, as well as a student. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4436.897s">students'</a>  well-being and their kind of like will to be in the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4441.399s">We've</a>  worked carefully with Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4442.519s">Cabral</a>  on numerous occasions for some of the events that she mentioned, such as like the pep rally or student risk staff basketball games or other games, as well as on policy making as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4453.903s">She</a>  has really stepped up and allowed us to give her input when it comes to important things that affect students, such as the homework policy, as well as other policies that we are currently working with her.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4468.336s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4469.056s">You</a>  two are involved in everything, just like some of our students that stood up. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4472.318s">So</a>  we appreciate all your involvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4475.699s">And</a>  we do have somebody, one person on. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4478.02s">Chris,</a>  if you could just name your name and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4480.602s">I'm</a>  gonna unmute you right now.</p>

    <p>[Bennett]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4482.623s">Hello?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4492.067s">Yes,</a>  name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4493.227s">My</a>  name is Christine Bennett. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4497.927s">from</a>  19 Martin Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4500.268s">I</a>  just had one quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4501.748s">I'm</a>  hearing about this program that will begin at Metro High that we're aiming for. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4505.689s">Would</a>  that be in place of Curtis Tufts? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4510.49s">The</a>  one we just took a vote on would not. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4512.891s">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4513.931s">You're</a>  welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4517.332s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4518.472s">Thank</a>  you to both of our principals for being here tonight for the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4521.513s">If</a>  there's no further questions, we'll move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4530.666s">I'm</a>  going to read number six and seven we have the budget update by Mr. Gerry McCue director of finance. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4538.292s">Number</a>  five. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4543.69s">career</a>  technical education CTE update Mr. Chad Fallon principal director of medical vocational technical high school and Dr. Peter Cushing assistant superintendent, my apologies.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4555.984s">Can</a>  I just interrupt. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4558.727s">Just</a>  so that the committee knows why these folks are here. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4562.631s">As</a>  we have been planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4565.915s">For</a>  the MSBA work, one of the things that we have to do because we have such a huge vocational school is fill out some documentation around what programs we have, how big they are, and how big we want them to be as we look forward to a new building of some kind. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4582.894s">And</a>  the other thing that this form asks us to do is lay out, if you need programming space for programs that don't exist today, what are those and how much enrollment are you anticipating in these programs that are yet to exist? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4597.338s">And</a>  MSBA goes on to describe a set of requirements around what constitutes something they will entertain. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4603.76s">So</a>  Mr. Fallon and Dr. Cushing have been working hard to articulate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4608.941s">My</a>  hope is that when they are done, we will take a vote here to direct them to continue to explore these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4617.587s">because</a>  that will be needed to send to the MSBA with our chapter 70 or viability plan documentation so that they can sort of consider all of this as part of our sort of input to what ultimately will become a feasibility study. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4633.251s">So</a>  I will turn it over to Mr. Fallon and Dr. Cushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4635.871s">I</a>  just wanted to set that sort of groundwork for everybody else.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4639.295s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4639.655s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4640.435s">Good</a>  evening, Madam Mayor, members of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4642.216s">First,</a>  I want to thank Mr. Fallon and all the CTE teachers for the amazing work that they do every day, giving our kids real world experiences and the work that Mr. Fallon and staff have done over the last several years to really bolster and expand the programs in an amazing manner up to this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4661.381s">So</a>  we'll share our presentation and then just jump right in. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4668.901s">So</a>  DESE approves Chapter 74 programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4673.805s">Right</a>  now, Medford High School has 15 of them, and we've seen an increase in demand and enrollment with several programs requiring a wait list. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4683.691s">Mr.</a>  Fallon mentioned, how many students are on a wait list right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4687.854s">47</a>  students, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4689.315s">We</a>  are not accepting students from outside of Medford anymore, which I think is really something that the citizens of Medford should know. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4698.086s">More</a>  than 50% of MHS students are selecting a CTE pathway and a new master schedule will hopefully align academic and vocational technical opportunities as we move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4713.467s">You</a>  wanna talk about survey demand?</p>

    <p>[Chad Fallon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4717.378s">So,</a>  as part of the documents we have to provide to MSBA, they want to see what our waitlist data looks like for the last three or four years so this just gives a snapshot and I highlighted in bold of the programs that every year we do see students on a list that most likely never make it in because in order to come off a waitlist somebody has to leave and that doesn't typically happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4736.909s">So,</a>  you know, in our research with looking past in past years and also what industry trends are telling us auto technology cosmetology electrical and health assisting our areas that we would want to seek expansion and in our new building as we reimagine. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4753.923s">This</a>  next slide shows some data of students participating in CTE. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4759.228s">So</a>  beginning in 21-22, we had just about 195 students in Exploratory, you placed 163, and it had a wait list of 14. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4767.514s">So</a>  you can see between 21 and 22 in this current year, the wait list is at or about the same, a little bit less than last year, but there was also other pathways that could have taken this year with the expansion of our arts electives. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4781.986s">So</a>  this year we had 72 choose a high school path. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4785.51s">So</a>  when we surveyed the Andrews and the McGlynn Middle School, we provided some context in a survey, which was a brief presentation from myself explaining about the survey, and then we provided the programs we currently have, and then we gave them some ideas of programs we're thinking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4802.33s">Criminal</a>  Justice and Protective Services, we had about 83% of the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4806.293s">By</a>  the way, this was based on 344 student responses. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4809.656s">As</a>  of today, though, there was 357. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4811.317s">So</a>  I think the little guys and gals are still hacking away at the survey, which is pretty funny. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4816.101s">Wait</a>  till you see some of the results. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4817.943s">Who</a>  knew they want sewing? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4821.215s">More</a>  than five people want sewing, we'll get to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4824.558s">We</a>  also looked at dental assistance. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4825.939s">This</a>  one, we had about half of them that thought that this would be something cool to have a dental assisting program. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4831.783s">We're</a>  also looking at things that other vocational schools in the state have had success with, so we're also taking that into consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4840.831s">Criminal</a>  justice, we talked about IT and networking. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4844.373s">We</a>  had close to 86%, is that 86? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4849.167s">see.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4850.689s">And</a>  then plumbers 66.9 was for it plumbing I had less than I thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4861.738s">The</a>  vet science program yielded about 63% of students thought that that would be cool. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4866.079s">And</a>  these are just some of the survey responses when I said, well, is there something that you have in mind that you would like us to think about? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4873.021s">And</a>  a lot of these were repetitive. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4875.662s">Meteorology,</a>  I thought that was cool, but sewing, that came up a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4879.282s">So</a>  it reminded me of kind of that need for that home economics. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4883.143s">So</a>  those are some of the survey results we used from that.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4888.177s">So</a>  some proposed new programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4890.859s">When</a>  we're considering proposing new programs for the CT, there are multiple factors to take into consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4897.383s">One</a>  is the survey data you just saw, but then we also want to look at what the workforce is telling us, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4903.948s">And</a>  what are the types of jobs that are being posted? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4907.55s">And</a>  so when we talk about criminal justice to open up, you can see the number of jobs that are there, but there are also jobs that a criminal justice path may lead to, such as being an attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4918.897s">working</a>  in the courthouse, anything within the criminal justice realm, but you can see the typical entry level education correlating across the table for security guards, detective and criminal investigators, police officers, EMTs, so on and so forth down through firefighters. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4936.387s">This</a>  type of program would not really require much for the school to start up, other than a classroom and perhaps, you know, not perhaps but a specific dedicated teacher to work with students in this, whereas dental assisting. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4953.058s">Um,</a>  for demand looks at 525 unique job opportunities within our catchment area on 70 with 70% of those for dental assistance, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4964.925s">And</a>  you can see in our catchment area where those jobs have posted in relation to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4975.623s">IT</a>  networking, a unique 1,482 jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4977.966s">All</a>  right, computer user support specialist for 1,389 and network, computer network support specialist for 93. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4990.964s">plumbing</a>  and HVAC, a total of 191 unique job postings for plumbers, pipefitters, and seamfitters. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=4997.067s">This</a>  data definitely surprised Mr. Fallon and myself because plumbing has been one of those shops, when you look at Medford High School right now, where we have CCL, electrical, automotive, carpentry, this is a more traditional <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5010.935s">CTE</a>  path shop that we thought would have more interest and more support, but we definitely think it is still something for the committee and for Medford to consider as we move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5024.344s">And</a>  veterinary science, a total of 266 unique job openings for veterinary technologists and technicians and veterinary assistants, laboratory animals, caretakers with 73% of that category. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5036.213s">This</a>  is the type of track that could lead students to becoming not only vet techs, vet assistants, but being veterinary doctors themselves.</p>

    <p>[Chad Fallon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5048.361s">Peter</a>  and I like to joke with Maurice that there'll be cows and horses running around the new Medford campus <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5054.537s">that</a>  tech program. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5056.859s">So</a>  when we talk about the four programs we're thinking about expanding, this doesn't mean that we couldn't seek to expand before the new building is in place, but just to give the committee a breakdown, we're looking at seven years of student waitlist data. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5070.311s">We</a>  know that there's demand, but there's also costs associated with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5074.154s">So</a>  as you saw in your packet, we've labeled kind of estimated as best we could, which it comes down to additional teaching staff and some equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5082.461s">You</a>  know, you're looking at an investment of just under 400,000 to expand these programs, whether it be now, or within the new building, but if we take build out and furnishings and the cost of a structure out of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5095.511s">This</a>  is what we're looking at to expand the current program so the idea tonight was to provide you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5100.737s">information</a>  about the new programs and then the jobs that we're expanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5103.882s">The</a>  last two slides really just show about the auto tech and cosmetology expansion. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5108.63s">There</a>  certainly are jobs in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5110.894s">So</a>  this would not be something that was a wasted endeavor. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5115.862s">The</a>  last thing to mention is that based on the greater Boston regional blueprint, by the way, all the data that we shared tonight came from the mass hire, which their job is really to scout the area and find out where the highest demand is and then they work with people to help them get jobs or get into job programs, even though healthcare and professional and technical services won't listed weren't listed in one of the <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5136.071s">reports,</a>  it's important to note that they're still listed as critical to the region. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5140.014s">So</a>  we may not have posted about culinary jobs, but it's still something that's very needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5143.816s">So</a>  I thought it was important to mention tonight that although certain things aren't mentioned in the regional blueprint, which by the way is out of date, it's from 2018, and there's a supplemental piece from 2020, we should just be thinking as we look for new programs, what things are critical to the region, and that's hospitality, construction, finance, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5161.248s">Any</a>  questions at this point?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5165.598s">Member</a>  Graham.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5166.92s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5168.202s">Um,</a>  in terms of the expansion of auto tech cosmetology, electrical and health assisting, can those expansions happen in the current space? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5178.856s">Or</a>  are you space constrained?</p>

    <p>[Chad Fallon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5180.97s">Yes,</a>  auto tech would require a third teacher cosmetology would require a third teacher and electrical would be another teacher elect electrical, we would need more space, health assisting you could do with a third teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5194.726s">So,</a>  at this point it comes down to teaching stuff.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5201.75s">None</a>  of those are currently budgeted for FY25, is that correct?</p>

    <p>[Chad Fallon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5205.513s">We've</a>  had an auto tech position, but for the past two years, we remove it for many reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5212.138s">We</a>  can function without three right now, so we usually end up foregoing that position, but it's been talked about for sure.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5220.223s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5221.785s">In</a>  terms of the expansion of those programs, I would love to see a report at some point early next year about sort of a proposal from you all to implement those expansions like over the course of the next <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5238.129s">number</a>  of years where space is not a constraint. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5240.631s">So</a>  obviously electrical would be a sort of a separate issue, but for the three shops where we could expand, what would you recommend that timeline be? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5248.958s">And</a>  do they all go at the same time? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5250.559s">Does</a>  one come first or second? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5252.701s">But</a>  I would like to see that, you know, it does not have to be now, it does not have to be before the end of the year, but as we think about like next fall, really having you come to us with a sort of a proposal of like what we should be planning for and expecting in the coming years, if that's possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5267.625s">very</a>  much so, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5268.566s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5269.787s">And</a>  then I'm gonna make a motion that the school committee request that the MSBA explore the program expansions and new programs outlined in this presentation as part of the feasibility study. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5284.82s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5285.14s">Did</a>  you get all of that?</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5919.698s">So</a>  just so that everyone knows, thank you all for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5922.421s">I</a>  know it's very hot in here and that's not on purpose, I promise. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5927.465s">But</a>  I'm afraid to consider opening the windows because I don't think that'll work. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5931.047s">So</a>  hopefully we can just bear with the heat. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5935.631s">Item</a>  number six is a budget update from Mr. Gerry McCue, our Director of Finance. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5940.175s">He's</a>  gonna provide his presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5942.116s">I'm</a>  gonna let the committee ask some questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5946.099s">And</a>  get their questions answered and then we will be happy to take public comment from all of you I assume many of you are here to speak, just to set your expectations. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5955.531s">We</a>  do ask that folks speaking at public comment limit their comments to three minutes and one time. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5962.959s">So</a>  please bear with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5966.773s">Please</a>  feel free to speak from the heart or whatever it is that you need to speak from, but also just remember to do it briefly so that we can all have a chance to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5978.242s">So,</a>  Mr. McHugh, it's all yours.</p>

    <p>[Gerry McCue]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5985.907s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5987.108s">Tonight,</a>  I wanted to just give a brief follow up. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5991.772s">We</a>  had a lot of <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5994.497s">comments</a>  and suggestions at the public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5999.982s">Some</a>  of those comments I'd like to address tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6005.247s">And</a>  of course at the end, we'll have time to answer any other questions that you might have. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6012.634s">So</a>  just to recap, <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6016.243s">We</a>  did have, this is an extremely difficult budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6022.768s">And</a>  at the public hearing, we talked about just a lot of needs to get this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6029.232s">I</a>  like to use the metaphor of a house where we wanna do some renovations, we'd like to add on, create a family room, <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6044.022s">this</a>  is a year that we have to fix the foundation because the foundation is cracking. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6049.104s">We</a>  don't want it to crumble for the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6053.265s">So</a>  we did propose reductions in our administrative assistant ranks and our administrators to try to gain some efficiencies in administration to achieve some budget savings. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6067.149s">We</a>  have had three, <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6070.518s">Administrative</a>  assistance take advantage of early retirement incentive. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6075.532s">and</a>  we'll be working with their union representatives to see how we can best meet the needs of the membership with these reductions. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6087.558s">We</a>  also looked at class size and looked at scheduling. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6094.001s">We</a>  had to propose a net reduction of five teachers at the elementary level, one at the middle grades, and six at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6106.843s">And</a>  then there was this notion brought up at the, at the public hearing that, you know, what's going on with performing arts, you know, we've, I've been on email chains and several members of the community are very concerned about, you know, we're trying to eliminate the band or the, <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6128.871s">The</a>  Color Guard, are we eliminating drama programs? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6133.555s">One</a>  email suggested that we were trying to eliminate all the performing arts programs, and that certainly is not the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6141.823s">The</a>  budget does provide for over $1.7 million for performing arts and fine arts programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6153.018s">What</a>  we did propose was to return the management of that program to one coordinator. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6161.105s">It</a>  had recently expanded to two coordinators, but in light of our budget situation, we brought that back to one. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6169.812s">And</a>  then we did discuss this theater teacher position that had, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6178.334s">resignation,</a>  actually, there were two teachers in this position over the course of the year, and the students weren't really selecting the courses that that position was teaching. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6196.985s">So</a>  that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6198.166s">Everything</a>  else in this program is funded, and that includes <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6204.864s">The</a>  marching band stipends, the guard stipends, drama programs are fully funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6213.194s">We</a>  will seek to offer certain theater sections within the teaching assignment of an existing teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6222.967s">that</a>  would better align with student interests. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6225.791s">And</a>  you could see with the exception of the theater teacher, all the current teachers funded in the performing and visual arts programs are funded in FY25. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6245.612s">The</a>  other another concern was with the health services program, you know, how did we come up with these recommended cuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6255.363s">We</a>  looked at the Massachusetts Department of Public Health recommended. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6263.547s">teaches</a>  nurses per student, which is between 250 and 500 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6269.61s">The</a>  National School Nurses Association recommends one nurse for every 750 students, but we're really focused on the Mass Department of Public Health for our criteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6288.092s">So</a>  currently, we have 15.6 teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6293.016s">I</a>  went back and I looked at the FY 2019-2020 budget, which was the budget before COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6306.457s">At</a>  that point in time, we had 12.6 nurses for roughly the same total enrollment. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6314.884s">Of</a>  course, it makes complete sense that we wanted to expand these ranks during COVID and return to school protocols. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6324.431s">But</a>  you can see that we are, <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6329.187s">in</a>  decent shape in terms of per-student staffing in FY24. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6335.835s">And</a>  across the board, we have one nurse for every 268 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6340.099s">So</a>  in FY25, with the reductions that we proposed, in FY25, <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6350.717s">We</a>  still achieve a cross-board staffing of 361 nurses per student. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6359.806s">We</a>  will have a staff of 11.6. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6365.131s">Myself,</a>  I'm a little bit concerned about the Brooks that's on the high end, but I believe that the, <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6374.246s">the</a>  incoming director can recommend staffing adjustments to kind of even that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6382.189s">But</a>  that's essentially how we arrived at those reductions. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6388.812s">And</a>  the next area was guidance Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6394.134s">Very</a>  similar to the nurses, we looked at recommended staffing levels, <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6405.144s">250</a>  students per guidance Councilor is recommended. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6411.072s">DESE</a>  published a study in 2019 to take a look at how we were doing against those averages, and on average in Massachusetts, there were 404 students per guidance Councilor, and then the national average was between 600 and almost 800 for middle school, and then 200 to 243 for high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6438.021s">So</a>  in FY24, we had two Councilors at each of the middle schools and then we had, slide please, and then we had six Councilors at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6458.014s">So</a>  we had a very, our staffing was even, <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6466.687s">better</a>  than the recommended average. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6471.668s">And</a>  then in FY25, with those reductions, we will have a higher average at the two middle schools, and we kind of maintain our staffing level at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6484.764s">So</a>  even with those reductions, there's on average is one guidance Councilor per 258 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6500.313s">And</a>  then kind of another comment was, you know, are we, these nurses and guidance Councilors are important in social emotional learning programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6516.587s">And</a>  that is absolutely true, but we have a number of other staff that support students' social emotional wellbeing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6526.595s">We</a>  have adjustment Councilors, <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6530.528s">BCBAs</a>  and Nexus specialists and those all are fully funded in FY25. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6538.713s">And</a>  just to take a look at the staffing loads for the adjustment Councilors, you'll see that they are pretty reasonable. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6550.399s">On</a>  average, we have 246 students per adjustment Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6557.993s">So</a>  we feel pretty good about that staffing and as to address SEL priorities next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6571.203s">We</a>  did talk about at the public hearing the possibility that our Chapter 70 state aid would increase from $135,000 over FY24 to $470,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6578.089s">There</a>  was an initiative in the House budget which raised the minimum student aid from $30 per student to $104,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6595.113s">The</a>  good news is that this $104 per student was included in the Senate Ways and Means budget, and that budget is currently being debated in the Senate. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6606.546s">So</a>  while there's no absolute guarantee that we'll get that money until the governor signs the budget, it is <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6616.895s">very</a>  good news that both the House and the Senate are recommending the same number. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6621.339s">So</a>  when they go to conference committee to work out the differences, there will be no difference in this line item. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6631.549s">So</a>  just to kind of recap where we left off, our current budget is $71.2 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6642.25s">We</a>  went through and we talked about the need. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6645.372s">We</a>  have collective bargaining agreements and other school staff that are in line for salary increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6654.637s">Some</a>  of these collective bargaining agreements are already agreed to, so they're binding obligation of the school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6663.702s">Approximately</a>  $4 million of this $8.2 million budget increase is <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6670.385s">strictly</a>  to salary increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6674.006s">And</a>  then we identified three other areas that make up the other half of that increase, which include a number of accounts that have been historically underfunded, a number of positions that are currently funded on ESSA that really need to be in the general fund next year because they represent core programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6699.269s">And</a>  then some new spending initiatives, special ed tuition is going up, a Chromebook and tablet refresh was $477,000 and other increases as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6720.407s">which</a>  would mean that we would need a budget of $79.4 million to meet all those needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6725.334s">We</a>  felt like that was <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6734.666s">unrealistic</a>  ask to make to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6739.589s">And</a>  we developed a plan to identify savings, which got our budget, which totaled just under $2.3 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6751.757s">And</a>  we identified some new funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6758.621s">We</a>  have an initiative that we would <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6763.652s">charge</a>  back programs that charge fees in our school system to recoup some administrative and facilities costs involved in supporting those programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6776.595s">We</a>  identified $200,000 in revolving funds in addition to what's already being charged to revolving funds to <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6787.199s">to</a>  also supplement the budget and came in at the public hearing with a budget of $76,684,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6792.844s">So</a>  I'm happy to answer any questions about this presentation or anything else that you might wanna talk about from the public hearing.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6818.766s">questions</a>  from the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6819.667s">Member</a>  Ruseau.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6823.289s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6823.729s">I</a>  greatly appreciate the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6827.251s">The</a>  additional clarity is always welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6830.152s">As</a>  I said in the last meeting, I am deeply grateful that you have removed some of the <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6842.099s">removed</a>  the veil of solvency that we have lived with in Medford for a generation or more. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6851.741s">When</a>  we have an expense of $2 million, we have a line item of $200,000 to pay for it, and we pay the $2 million, it is reasonable for the public to conclude that we didn't need that money. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6865.624s">But</a>  we got that other $1.8 million by scraping it out of this leftover grant for, <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6871.963s">know,</a>  reading or whatever we you know we scraped it up from all of these other places, and so that when you look at our budget, you think we spent $200,000 on an item that actually costs $2 million, and that is the opposite of transparency in any and every sense of the word no matter what you think transparency means. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6892.051s">And</a>  believe me, everyone in this room has a different definition of transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6896.476s">We</a>  all do agree probably that if something costs $2 million, we will tell you it costs $2 million, and we'll put a $2 million item in the budget to pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6906.025s">And</a>  that has not existed in Medford public schools for as long as I've been here for seven and a half years and my understanding is for long before that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6915.13s">And</a>  it's an incredible disservice to the community to continue thinking that something that costs $2 million is only going to cost us $200,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6922.818s">And</a>  that is the, you know, as horrible as this budget is that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6932.506s">frankly,</a>  I can never thank you enough for that, because it is something for my seven and a half years I have been asking for, and it has not been something that I've been able to get. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6946.854s">So</a>  in light of that, and in light of the fact, you did say one other thing that, you mentioned whether it was a reasonable request, the $79 million, and we can, <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6963.085s">Your</a>  job is your job. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6965.226s">But</a>  in my opinion, the request is the school committee's request and we sort of decide what's reasonable. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6972.027s">And,</a>  you know, in light of that, I'm going to make a motion that the Medford school committee budget request in the amount of $79,399,774 for the responsible operations of the Metro public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6986.311s">In</a>  2024 2025 be submitted in writing to the member city council and the mayor of Medford within 48 hours of this motion.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7000.489s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. so before we continue talking about Mr. so his motion is on the floor if there is a second it can stay on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7011.537s">Second,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7013.419s">But</a>  we're not going to take a vote on that until we have heard the questions of the rest of the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7017.622s">And</a>  we have heard from all of you so. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7022.185s">Everyone</a>  can just take a breath, exhale, we're going to get to all of you before we get to any sort of voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7028.533s">Mr.</a>  so can you please sort of explain those numbers one more time just so that everybody understands what you just said.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7034.915s">Certainly,</a>  so I'll read the language and then explain it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7039.618s">Zoom</a>  keeps coming in and out for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7042.04s">The</a>  Medford School Committee budget request in the amount of $79,399,774 for the responsible operations of the Medford Public Schools in 2024-2025 be submitted in writing to the Medford City Council and the Mayor of Medford within 48 hours of this motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7059.813s">So</a>  that is the number that was calculated and displayed at the last meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7064.736s">It</a>  is the number that was on one of these slides. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7067.178s">And</a>  I do have a spreadsheet that I've shared with Dr. Cushing, if he could put it up, which actually explains that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7078.067s">Did</a>  you get it? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7080.71s">That's</a>  because my Zoom is in and out. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7082.351s">Sorry,</a>  one second.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7084.933s">So</a>  before we take any vote, we'll make sure that we can look at that spreadsheet. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7088.156s">So</a>  take your time, Dr. Cushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7090.798s">Are</a>  there questions from the rest of the committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7094.093s">Member</a>  Bradley.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7100.26s">My</a>  voice is so loud. <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7102.662s">Can</a>  we specify the elementary positions by building that are being cut? <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7107.868s">Yes.</a> </p>
