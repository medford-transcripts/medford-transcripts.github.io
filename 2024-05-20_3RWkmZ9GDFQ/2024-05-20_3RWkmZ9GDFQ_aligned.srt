00:06:38,484 --> 00:06:39,345
You're asking us also, Mayor.

25
00:06:39,645 --> 00:06:39,885

26
00:06:40,005 --> 00:06:40,645
Thank you for being here.

27
00:06:41,065 --> 00:06:42,986
If you all may rise to salute the flag, please.

28
00:06:44,787 --> 00:06:49,909
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands,

29
00:06:53,206 --> 00:06:54,787
with liberty and justice for all.

30
00:06:56,008 --> 00:06:56,408
Thank you.

31
00:06:58,349 --> 00:07:17,922
We have our consent agenda, bills and payrolls, approval of capital purchases, public budget hearing meeting minutes from May 6, 2024, regular school committee meeting minutes from May 6, 2024, ad hoc subcommittee on handbook process minutes from May 8, 2024, behavioral health and special education subcommittee minutes May 15, 2024,

32
00:07:19,841 --> 00:07:26,063
and a recommendation to approve a $3,000 grant from the Massachusetts Cultural Council to fund summer arts workshops.

33
00:07:26,303 --> 00:07:27,324
Is there a motion?

34
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:32,946
Motion to sever the public hearing minutes and the behavioral and special ed.

35
00:07:34,707 --> 00:07:39,409
Motion to sever by Member Reinfeldt, seconded by Member Rousseau.

36
00:07:39,489 --> 00:07:40,269
All those in favor?

37
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:43,239
Motion to sever has been approved.

38
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:59,363
I'd like to amend the minutes to the Special Education and Behavioral Health Subcommittee to include a link to the meeting recording, because I believe that the feedback provided by the representatives from Curtis-Tufts should be easily accessible with the record of the votes.

39
00:08:00,684 --> 00:08:06,446
Motion to include a link on those meeting minutes by Member Reinfeldt, seconded by?

40
00:08:06,866 --> 00:08:07,166
Second.

41
00:08:08,066 --> 00:08:10,167
Member Ntukpa, all those in favor?

42
00:08:11,232 --> 00:08:12,012
All those opposed?

43
00:08:13,413 --> 00:08:21,014
And I'd also like to strike from the public hearing minutes the home address of the students who provided public comment for privacy reasons.

44
00:08:22,555 --> 00:08:26,956
Strike the home address from the meeting minutes from May 6th, 2024 public budget hearing.

45
00:08:26,976 --> 00:08:32,497
And just put the- Just put their names that they spoke.

46
00:08:32,557 --> 00:08:37,098
I don't think their home address should be on public record for students.

47
00:08:38,203 --> 00:08:46,905
Motion to amend the public hearing meeting minutes from May 6, 2024 regarding the budget by member Reinfeld, is there a second?

48
00:08:47,065 --> 00:08:47,345

00:08:49,346 --> 00:08:50,026
Aye.

51
00:08:50,206 --> 00:08:50,946
All those opposed?

52
00:08:52,107 --> 00:08:54,087
Meetings are passed as amended.

53
00:08:54,107 --> 00:08:57,948
And motion to approve the rest of the consent agenda.

00:08:58,268 --> 00:09:01,329
Motion to approve the rest of the consent agenda by member Reinfeld, seconded by?

55
00:09:01,549 --> 00:09:01,849
Second.

56
00:09:02,129 --> 00:09:03,550
Member Ntapa, all those in favor?

57
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:03,630
Aye.

58
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:05,310
All those opposed?

59
00:09:06,211 --> 00:09:07,451
Consent agenda is approved.

60
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:15,002
We have reports of subcommittees, ad hoc, subcommittee on handbook process, May 8th, 2024.

61
00:09:18,903 --> 00:09:23,584
CHCB AB, handbook review and schedule, the school committee's report.

62
00:09:24,204 --> 00:09:24,824
Member Russo?

63
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:25,824
Motion to waive the reading.

64
00:09:26,044 --> 00:09:28,905
Motion to waive the reading with an explanation.

65
00:09:30,286 --> 00:09:32,466
It's on the agenda and it's quite long.

66
00:09:32,486 --> 00:09:35,987
I'm happy to talk about it too, but if you wanna read it, you're welcome to.

67
00:09:37,441 --> 00:09:39,022
what is the committee, would they like me to read it?

68
00:09:39,402 --> 00:09:39,722
Second.

69
00:09:41,023 --> 00:09:42,224
Just to waive the reading.

70
00:09:43,345 --> 00:09:48,247
Motion for approval by Member Rousseau, seconded by Member Graham.

71
00:09:48,468 --> 00:09:49,348
All those in favor?

72
00:09:49,368 --> 00:09:50,109
Aye.

73
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:51,509
Okay, meeting is waived.

74
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,010
If you could give a synopsis.

75
00:09:53,411 --> 00:09:53,931
Absolutely.

76
00:09:54,331 --> 00:09:59,014
So the, sorry, as I have to take the minutes at the same time, give me just a moment.

77
00:09:59,034 --> 00:10:02,476
Here we go.

78
00:10:04,977 --> 00:10:05,638
So on

79
00:10:06,704 --> 00:10:17,605
When did we actually meet on May 8 to discuss the process for doing school handbooks the school committee is required annually by law to approve school handbooks, and we have.

80
00:10:19,073 --> 00:10:22,016
done that some years and not done that some or many years.

81
00:10:22,516 --> 00:10:36,970
So we worked up a process we reviewed I reviewed, I took some example policy from other districts, notably Cambridge, and worked up a timeline policy that we, the rest of the committee members.

82
00:10:38,792 --> 00:10:48,396
fleshed out the synopsis is that there's three phases of the handbook process that we would like to see implemented.

83
00:10:48,956 --> 00:10:54,318
The first phase is the initiation of the handbook update process, which the superintendent's office will manage.

84
00:10:55,619 --> 00:11:00,961
And there's quite a long date range of August 1st to September 30th for them to accomplish that.

85
00:11:01,801 --> 00:11:19,223
Then those go over to the school council the site camp, school councils excuse me at each of the buildings, and those individual councils one of their required, but one of their tasks as a school council is to draft changes to the handbook, and they get a pretty big.

86
00:11:19,844 --> 00:11:23,927
October 1 to January 31 is the expected time when they would do that work.

87
00:11:25,008 --> 00:11:30,012
And then finally, this comes back to the school committee for approval sometime between February 1 and April 30.

88
00:11:30,072 --> 00:11:39,140
There's a whole, there's a lot of language, but those are the most important things, is that there's dates and there's expectations.

89
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:44,524
And I think that the big improvement here, aside from having dates, the big improvement is that

90
00:11:45,965 --> 00:11:49,386
there's these two memorandums that will accompany these changes.

91
00:11:49,606 --> 00:11:55,027
So the laws change every year, court cases, et cetera.

92
00:11:55,427 --> 00:11:59,707
And so we often have to update our school handbooks because we don't have a choice.

93
00:12:00,567 --> 00:12:08,089
But when the school councils, and I've heard this from school councils, they make these changes and they don't have any idea why.

94
00:12:08,609 --> 00:12:15,030
So there'll be a memorandum that goes to them explaining exactly why these are changes that you don't really have a choice on.

95
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:30,877
And then if the school council wishes to make further changes to the handbooks, you know, things like school pickup at elementary schools, they would also write that up so that when we get the actual handbooks for approval, we're not reading them like

96
00:12:31,337 --> 00:12:35,380
just this gigantic set of documents with no idea what changed from last year.

97
00:12:36,281 --> 00:12:41,465
So hopefully that will improve the process and make it so that we actually do the approvals.

98
00:12:42,326 --> 00:12:45,769
Because I mean, all the school handbooks stacked together is quite a thing.

99
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:51,073
And having no clue what changed year to year is, is sort of a monumental task.

100
00:12:51,174 --> 00:12:54,576
So that's the policy proposal.

101
00:12:54,596 --> 00:12:54,897
The

102
00:12:57,138 --> 00:13:02,680
We didn't have administration in the meeting, and that was on purpose, because we wanted to just focus on what the school committee wanted.

103
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:12,883
So if the dates do not work for the administration or the school councils, we're certainly happy to hear feedback on that, and adjust those dates.

104
00:13:13,383 --> 00:13:15,784
So that is the synopsis.

105
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:21,926
Is there a motion to approve?

106
00:13:22,966 --> 00:13:24,667
Or do you want to?

107
00:13:26,032 --> 00:13:27,712
Motion to approve first reading.

108
00:13:28,232 --> 00:13:30,793
Motion to approve first reading by member Rousseau, seconded by?

109
00:13:30,813 --> 00:13:31,373
Second.

110
00:13:32,033 --> 00:13:33,373
Member Ntopper, all those in favor?

111
00:13:33,673 --> 00:13:33,973
Aye.

112
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:34,934
All those opposed?

113
00:13:35,934 --> 00:13:37,014
First reading is passed.

114
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:43,075
We have behavioral health and special education subcommittee then meeting with member Graham.

115
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,995
Can I motion to waive the second reading?

116
00:13:48,056 --> 00:13:53,037
Of the handbook review and schedule, motion to waive the second reading by member Graham.

117
00:13:53,992 --> 00:14:01,258
Yeah, we would like to give the administration and school councils a chance to confirm that this works for them.

118
00:14:01,738 --> 00:14:02,478
Oh, okay, fine.

119
00:14:02,859 --> 00:14:03,259
Withdrawn.

120
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:04,440
Withdrawn.

121
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:12,666
Behavioral health and special education subcommittee meeting was held on May 15, 2024.

122
00:14:12,846 --> 00:14:17,349
Recommendation to co-localize Curtis Tufts and the main high school campus.

123
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:20,412
Would anybody like to give an update on this?

124
00:14:20,512 --> 00:14:21,052
Member Roussell?

125
00:14:21,553 --> 00:14:21,973
Certainly.

126
00:14:24,798 --> 00:14:27,863
So the last school committee meeting was the last one, I believe.

127
00:14:27,883 --> 00:14:30,548
Actually, it's in here.

128
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:51,525
On April 29th, not the last school committee meeting, there was a resolution to have the subcommittee discuss the possibility of co-locating the Curtis Tufts with the Medford High School when we are actually re-imagining slash rebuilding Medford High.

129
00:14:52,146 --> 00:14:56,530
And there were a lot of reasons for that, such as some of the more obvious ones is that

130
00:14:57,346 --> 00:15:04,733
The Medford High students not at Curtis Tufts would be in a beautiful facility and the Curtis Tufts is if you've seen it is not exactly that.

131
00:15:05,473 --> 00:15:19,106
But facilities aside, they were all these opportunities that Curtis Tufts students cannot actually participate in or it's very, very difficult to get across town between classes and club participation is low.

132
00:15:21,489 --> 00:15:31,809
At the last meeting there was also the director of the program in Somerville, and they used to have a separate program like Medford does, and they co located when they built a new Somerville High School.

133
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:35,263
And the reviews were amazing.

134
00:15:35,943 --> 00:15:44,128
You know, students, their therapeutic learning program are captains of sports teams, participating in all of the clubs.

135
00:15:44,648 --> 00:15:51,432
So the quality of educational experience for those students went very much through the roof.

136
00:15:51,912 --> 00:15:53,613
So we listened to, you know,

137
00:15:55,635 --> 00:16:11,708
I believe it was a survey or just maybe just gathered information from current students, staff were in the meeting of the Curtis Tufts, and the, in my opinion, the unanimous opinion of everyone who participated was that this made sense to make this recommendation.

138
00:16:12,328 --> 00:16:16,432
So, this is the recommendation of the subcommittee that we

139
00:16:17,092 --> 00:16:25,654
co locate the Curtis Tufts, at some point, probably when we do the high school over with the main campus.

140
00:16:27,174 --> 00:16:28,374
Great, thank you for the work.

141
00:16:29,074 --> 00:16:33,095
Motion for approval by members so seconded by member of the party.

142
00:16:33,155 --> 00:16:33,895
All those in favor.

143
00:16:33,915 --> 00:16:35,595
I was opposed.

144
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:36,195
Thank you.

145
00:16:36,235 --> 00:16:44,657
We'll send that to the MSP a subcommittee report of superintendent, Dr. Maurice Edward Vincent updates and comments.

146
00:16:47,346 --> 00:16:48,969
Thank you.

147
00:16:56,249 --> 00:17:00,090
having several presentations to recognize some of our student accomplishments.

148
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:07,531
But later, after we get through our first additional four reports, we will be presenting the budget update.

149
00:17:08,812 --> 00:17:22,595
During this presentation, we hope that we are able to answer many of the questions that have come in to the district through email or through direct conversations, specifically regarding the arts and

150
00:17:23,855 --> 00:17:27,896
change in programming that is going to be recommended for the arts.

151
00:17:28,676 --> 00:17:35,258
So I am asking all of you who are here this evening to please let us get through the agenda.

152
00:17:35,779 --> 00:17:46,442
And once we're done with that we'll have a budget update and presentation in time for questions and for us to be able to explain the rationale

153
00:17:47,722 --> 00:17:51,184
work that went behind the decisions that did have to be made.

154
00:17:51,845 --> 00:18:08,235
I can say, just for the purposes of the audience that is here, there have been a lot of questions about no longer having a marching band or anything related to the performing arts, and that is complete misinformation.

155
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:14,980
The student experience in the Medford Public Schools will be an identical student experience.

156
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:28,751
The one arts related position that was cut was due to a resignation that we received, and that resignation has taken place already.

157
00:18:28,771 --> 00:18:37,958
The individual has resigned from the district and is no longer employed with Medford public schools, and that was a theater arts position.

158
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,703
cut without a face or a name.

159
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:57,919
So I do want to call that out because there have been many communications about arts programming, ending in midfield, and I deeply, deeply support the arts and so does the entire method public schools.

160
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:01,483
So I wanted to just put that information out there.

161
00:19:01,963 --> 00:19:06,989
and try to correct some of the misinformation that was spread.

162
00:19:07,009 --> 00:19:12,034
I do recognize today we have our CCSR update.

163
00:19:12,815 --> 00:19:19,422
Mr. Trotter will be here with our students and recognize two of our Brooke students, Savannah McLaughlin

164
00:19:19,762 --> 00:19:25,469
and Adam Costello who will talk about their special project that they did this year.

165
00:19:25,489 --> 00:19:28,653
We're very excited and happy to hear about you.

166
00:19:29,353 --> 00:19:37,443
I want to recognize Dr. Nicole Hughes, our Director of Humanities, who will be recognizing many of our students that have

167
00:19:38,504 --> 00:19:42,308
performed a wonderful outstanding achievements over the course of this year.

168
00:19:42,989 --> 00:19:57,863
And then we will have a high school update from Mr. Brown, the principal of the high school and Mr. Chad found principal director of the vocational school, and Mr. Brown will be discussing the high school survey results.

169
00:19:58,524 --> 00:20:15,927
And then following those presentations, Mr. Chairman, the director of finance will be presenting a finance update to provide context and additional background, followed by a vote of the school committee.

170
00:20:16,747 --> 00:20:17,127
Thank you.

171
00:20:20,188 --> 00:20:21,408
Thank you, Dr. Edwardson.

172
00:20:26,383 --> 00:20:30,925
Like I said, next up is CCSR update and student recognition.

173
00:20:31,765 --> 00:20:38,147
Mr. Richard Trotter, director of CCSR, accompanied by Brooks Elementary School students Savannah McLaughlin and Adam Costello.

174
00:20:38,508 --> 00:20:39,348
Welcome to our meeting.

175
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,210
Okay, good.

176
00:20:50,571 --> 00:20:50,811
Okay.

177
00:20:51,351 --> 00:20:53,453
I should know that I used to run the media tech department.

178
00:20:54,614 --> 00:20:58,417
My name is Richard trial and director of the CCSR and happy to be here.

179
00:20:58,437 --> 00:21:06,084
I want to thank the school committee the mayor and superintendent for supporting the program.

180
00:21:06,104 --> 00:21:09,847
I also want to thank the advisors you have the list in your report.

181
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:18,094
The executive team of the high school have been very active and supportive of the program, doing a lot of work.

182
00:21:18,674 --> 00:21:26,379
Oprah and Anna Narika, who just got accepted to Harvard University, I think that was in the news.

183
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:31,062
Sophia Suho and Jonah Siegel.

184
00:21:31,182 --> 00:21:37,366
Those four students were very instrumental in getting the whole high school programs accomplished in the last two years.

185
00:21:38,747 --> 00:21:43,489
And mostly I want to thank the students of the CCSR for all their fine work.

186
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:48,632
And then I also want to thank the benefactors.

187
00:21:48,912 --> 00:21:53,695
We have three benefactors that have provided $700,000 in funds for the program.

188
00:21:54,355 --> 00:22:00,938
The Cummings Foundation, Crystal Campbell Community Fund, and Bloomberg Foundation making this possible.

189
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:05,981
And we're funded through the next six years under the Cummings Foundation grant.

190
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:14,732
As you know, the mission of the program is to develop leaders, social entrepreneurs who work to make the world a better place.

191
00:22:14,912 --> 00:22:15,513
It's that simple.

192
00:22:16,193 --> 00:22:21,276
And we've had, this year, 400 students, approximately 70 projects.

193
00:22:22,356 --> 00:22:29,220
In my full report, which you have, I think it's 80 pages long, you will find all those projects.

194
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:33,202
And so we're very proud of the work the students did and advisors did this year.

195
00:22:37,483 --> 00:22:39,525
I just want to mention one more thing before I bring the students up.

196
00:22:39,905 --> 00:22:52,115
We have a summer art studio program that's going to be run through from Cummings Foundation funds and that will be publicized once we get the schedule set and it will take place in the month of July.

197
00:22:52,135 --> 00:22:59,541
And so I look forward to that and we'll be putting out there to the public and hopefully we'll get some good response this year.

198
00:23:03,001 --> 00:23:06,105
I'd like to have Jonas Segal over here, just short.

199
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:07,487
I'd like to have Jonas say a few words.

200
00:23:07,547 --> 00:23:08,729
He represents the high school.

201
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:10,932
He's one of the executive team leaders.

202
00:23:11,092 --> 00:23:13,355
And then we're gonna bring up Adam and Savannah.

203
00:23:14,536 --> 00:23:14,777
Thank you.

204
00:23:18,732 --> 00:23:20,992
Hello, my name is Jonah Siegel.

205
00:23:21,072 --> 00:23:24,293
I'm part of the executive team of the CCSR at the high school.

206
00:23:25,673 --> 00:23:27,894
I joined the CCSR as a freshman.

207
00:23:28,474 --> 00:23:42,536
And since then I began a project of river cleanups with my friend Maggie, and we've partnered with the Missick River Watershed Association and held many successful cleanups.

208
00:23:43,136 --> 00:23:47,577
And we were the youngest ever winners of a Tufts Community Grant.

209
00:23:48,117 --> 00:23:48,717
for our effort.

210
00:23:49,798 --> 00:23:57,604
And I wanted to talk about how CCSR, what I think is really special about it is how it changes your mindset on leadership.

211
00:23:58,405 --> 00:24:01,928
I can remember when I was a freshman, and I just joined the CCSR.

212
00:24:02,508 --> 00:24:07,052
When I looked around and I saw things around me that needed improving, I

213
00:24:08,834 --> 00:24:16,517
Before I would just walk and continue about my day, but now I would think about it and I would say, how could I make a CCSR project about this?

214
00:24:16,637 --> 00:24:17,997
How could I change this?

215
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:22,379
And I think that's what's great about the CCSR is it gives you a platform.

216
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:35,343
It gives you a resources, not only financial resources and in terms of mentors, but it also gives you a community that really encourages the mindset of just go out and do it.

217
00:24:35,463 --> 00:24:37,404
Like be the change you wanna see in the world.

218
00:24:38,772 --> 00:24:49,775
And I think that's really special for children to develop, which is why I think it's great that we have this program all throughout the district and the elementary schools and the middle schools and the high schools.

219
00:24:50,235 --> 00:25:01,278
And I hope it can continue to expand and be a part of more children's lives, because it's really just a great place for them to learn that they can make a change.

220
00:25:14,531 --> 00:25:20,857
I want to recognize two former CCR members, Aaron O'Roddy and John Van Topper.

221
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:22,518
Good morning, guys.

222
00:25:22,538 --> 00:25:33,107
Now I'll introduce the two students from the Brooks School who did the excellent report, a project on the postal safety, and they are Savannah and Adam.

223
00:25:33,308 --> 00:25:33,648
Come on up.

224
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:43,671
Hello.

225
00:25:45,236 --> 00:25:46,280
I'm going to read the letter.

226
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:54,841
My name is Savannah McLaughlin, along with my classmate Adam Costello.

227
00:25:55,321 --> 00:25:59,464
We are fifth grade students from the Brooks Elementary School on High Street.

228
00:26:00,145 --> 00:26:05,248
We both learned about the terrible attack on one of your co-workers this past Halloween.

229
00:26:05,768 --> 00:26:08,150
I live in the neighborhood where the assault took place.

230
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:14,795
I saw all the news trucks and reporters at the end of my street while my friends and me were trick-or-treating.

231
00:26:15,595 --> 00:26:22,078
I didn't know why they weren't there, but I remember being excited to have a chance to be seen on TV.

232
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:25,840
It wasn't until the next day I was told what happened.

233
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:32,223
Adam heard the news by overhearing some students talking about it in school.

234
00:26:32,483 --> 00:26:38,626
We both felt so sad for the victim and so angry about the cowardly attackers.

235
00:26:38,986 --> 00:26:41,047
They had no way to put a finger on him.

236
00:26:41,527 --> 00:26:43,488
Male carriers are very important.

237
00:26:44,168 --> 00:26:48,172
and deserve to be treated with the highest degree of respect.

238
00:26:48,533 --> 00:26:49,894
He was just doing his job.

239
00:26:49,974 --> 00:26:56,541
We've been told there has been a rise of attacks on postal workers.

240
00:26:57,021 --> 00:26:58,383
We want this to stop.

241
00:27:02,106 --> 00:27:06,648
centers for citizenship and social responsibility.

242
00:27:06,968 --> 00:27:16,233
It is a district wide after school program that's dedicated to making the community and the world a better place to live.

243
00:27:16,733 --> 00:27:20,175
Each year students are asked to think of a project that will help

244
00:27:22,665 --> 00:27:29,609
make a positive impact, we decided on track, and we'll help my friends weather carriers to feel safe.

245
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:39,135
We were first thinking of supplying you with pepper spray or tasers but after some teacher guidance, we thought it was best to build safety whistles.

246
00:27:39,615 --> 00:27:43,638
First, we co-hosted a school fundraiser at the Brooks to raise enough money.

247
00:27:44,358 --> 00:27:47,540
to provide all seven of you a neon orange whistle.

248
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:55,165
The emergency whistles have an adjustable reflective liner and can emit high and low frequency sounds.

249
00:27:55,305 --> 00:27:58,648
If you ever feel unsafe on the job, roll on this whistle.

250
00:27:58,668 --> 00:28:02,550
Hopefully, help will come quickly or the danger will leave quickly.

251
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:06,773
We hope you find this gift useful.

252
00:28:07,193 --> 00:28:09,715
Please always know we appreciate and care about you.

253
00:28:10,135 --> 00:28:11,576
Thank you for serving MET through.

254
00:28:11,977 --> 00:28:13,738
Sincerely, Adam and Savannah.

255
00:28:28,961 --> 00:28:35,563
I just want to thank everybody that is part of the CCSR it is.

256
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,681
a huge, a huge undertaking.

257
00:28:44,381 --> 00:28:50,942
And I think it's a huge, amazing, it's really amazing that this was happening in our city.

258
00:28:51,162 --> 00:28:54,703
I love that Jonas said that this is making him be, you know, a better person.

259
00:28:54,743 --> 00:29:02,465
He's not walking by something and what more do we want in our community than someone to say, hey, this needs to be fixed or this isn't right.

260
00:29:02,925 --> 00:29:04,965
I think that it's one of the most important things that you can do.

261
00:29:05,525 --> 00:29:08,506
It is so hard to get up to that podium and speak.

262
00:29:09,486 --> 00:29:12,048
Jonah you did it without any writing.

263
00:29:12,708 --> 00:29:16,231
I stood at that podium many times I couldn't do without writing something ahead of time.

264
00:29:16,551 --> 00:29:21,334
You're very well spoken, I've watched you grow at the Brooks, and I'm so grateful that you're here so thank you so much.

265
00:29:22,234 --> 00:29:22,775
Savannah.

266
00:29:23,575 --> 00:29:27,077
I'm a huge fan of your mama but you might have moved ahead.

267
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:29,959
in the McLaughlin chain for me tonight.

268
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:31,039
That was awesome.

269
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,300
You and Adam are amazing.

270
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:37,122
I've loved watching all these Brooks bees come up here, especially once a bee, always a bee, right?

271
00:29:37,743 --> 00:29:39,143
So my heart is always there.

272
00:29:39,183 --> 00:29:41,384
So thank you guys so much for making a difference.

273
00:29:41,444 --> 00:29:45,686
And thanks for switching on the taser and the pepper spray.

274
00:29:46,046 --> 00:29:46,587
Good job.

275
00:29:48,528 --> 00:29:49,128
Membrane topper.

276
00:29:50,037 --> 00:29:55,780
I also just wanted to take a second and just recognize how important this program is to our students.

277
00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:04,785
I actually, unfortunately, only got a chance to be a part of it my senior year in high school, but that was the cohort that witnessed it go to the elementary and middle school level.

278
00:30:04,985 --> 00:30:13,289
And just seeing how much it's grown in only what I like to say two years, but it's been like five or six now, is absolutely amazing.

279
00:30:13,349 --> 00:30:18,412
And I'm so proud of you guys and everyone who's involved to get up here and speak and do what you do.

280
00:30:18,872 --> 00:30:36,321
This program really takes you know when you take a moment and look at students special interests and you look at what they want to do to give back to the community and you fund that and you encourage them to do it, you see such an increase in their overall academic success and their participation in our community.

281
00:30:36,881 --> 00:30:39,282
the social emotional learning skills that you get.

282
00:30:39,802 --> 00:30:47,785
And I just, I really, you know, seeing what happened and seeing the unfortunate incident that happened and just immediately coming to action and then doing this.

283
00:30:47,885 --> 00:30:52,127
I just, I can't commend you guys enough and I can't wait to see what you guys do next.

284
00:30:52,187 --> 00:30:52,847
I really can't.

285
00:30:52,887 --> 00:30:53,727
So thank you.

286
00:30:53,987 --> 00:30:54,688
Thank you so much.

287
00:31:04,976 --> 00:31:05,516
Yes, thank you.

288
00:31:05,656 --> 00:31:10,599
I just want to comment that I feel like I see Jonah more than some of my own children.

289
00:31:11,819 --> 00:31:17,723
Everywhere I go I see Jonah whether it's in a play or at the State House on May 10 or the ninth.

290
00:31:18,487 --> 00:31:35,974
sixth, whatever, he seems to always be everywhere, which is sort of what you'd expect from our students who are, and not just Jonah, there are several other students who are also at the Statehouse, and I don't think that's a CCSR project, but you know, they're

291
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:40,600
participation doesn't just start and end with the club times.

292
00:31:41,541 --> 00:31:43,103
And I think that's really impressive.

293
00:31:43,303 --> 00:31:49,311
I do wonder how anybody manages that much in their schedule, but thank you for all of your efforts.

294
00:31:52,668 --> 00:31:52,968
Yes.

295
00:31:54,089 --> 00:31:57,851
I just want to say thank you again to all of you, you did a wonderful job.

296
00:31:58,451 --> 00:32:01,132
Savannah, Adam and thank you Jonah as well.

297
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:13,818
I want to thank Mr. Trotter, I know we wouldn't have this program without the generous support of Cummings Foundation and our other partners but the Cummings Foundation truly

298
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:27,328
keeps getting back to Medford, and this is a worthwhile program to continue investing in and so I just want to send another special thank you to them for their continued support of our school programming.

299
00:32:27,809 --> 00:32:28,449
Thank you again.

300
00:32:30,831 --> 00:32:31,311
Member Graham.

301
00:32:32,752 --> 00:32:34,814
I just wanted to say thank you Adam and Savannah.

302
00:32:36,471 --> 00:32:37,952
Savannah and I live in the same neighborhood.

303
00:32:38,053 --> 00:32:45,940
So and I happen to be home when when attacked place and I happen to be driving by as the police were responding.

304
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:48,923
So it was sort of hard to understand what was happening at the time.

305
00:32:49,363 --> 00:32:55,369
But I sure I'm glad the news media didn't ruin Halloween for us in the neighborhood because that would have been terrible.

306
00:32:55,429 --> 00:32:57,751
But thank you both for taking care of our mail carriers.

307
00:32:57,831 --> 00:32:58,952
It's really important work.

308
00:32:59,213 --> 00:32:59,493
Thank you.

309
00:33:11,207 --> 00:33:16,251
Just before we finish, I just want to mention the fact that the advisor, Michael Coates, couldn't be here because of a family issue.

310
00:33:16,791 --> 00:33:19,554
And he does a fantastic job with the students.

311
00:33:19,854 --> 00:33:23,537
This is not the first time that he's done an outstanding project with the students.

312
00:33:23,977 --> 00:33:27,500
And finally, I'm very proud of the program.

313
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,642
I'm very proud of these students.

314
00:33:29,662 --> 00:33:30,683
It makes me happy.

315
00:33:30,783 --> 00:33:31,684
I'm sure it makes you happy.

316
00:33:32,104 --> 00:33:32,585
So thank you.

317
00:33:33,685 --> 00:33:34,006
Thank you.

318
00:33:41,072 --> 00:33:46,014
We have number three humanities student recognition, Dr. Nicole Chiesa, Director of Humanities.

319
00:33:46,355 --> 00:33:46,715
Welcome.

320
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:58,821
Good evening.

321
00:34:00,261 --> 00:34:05,284
Thank you for the opportunity tonight to honor several of our students who have

322
00:34:05,953 --> 00:34:19,200
really accomplished so many amazing achievements throughout the year, so we won't bring them all up because we know that would take too much time but we're happy for those that were able to attend tonight we know there are games going on and other things happening.

323
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:24,943
And as I go through the names will ask people to stand so that we can honor them.

324
00:34:25,376 --> 00:34:26,296
slide by slides.

325
00:34:27,017 --> 00:34:33,620
But first, I do want to take a moment on the next slide to thank the school committee, to thank Ms.

326
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:36,901
Cabral, Mr. Fallon, Mr. Tucci, and Ms.

327
00:34:36,941 --> 00:34:40,783
Skane for supporting these endeavors because we could not do it alone.

328
00:34:41,183 --> 00:34:44,885
Certainly for thanking you for funding and supporting us throughout the school year.

329
00:34:44,945 --> 00:34:45,505
So thank you.

330
00:34:48,413 --> 00:34:50,234
So I'm going to be reading a lot of names.

331
00:34:50,694 --> 00:34:56,637
You do have the report that you were provided with that explains several of these different endeavors.

332
00:34:56,717 --> 00:35:01,600
But if there's any questions, I am more than happy to explain anything.

333
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,523
We are going to start with the writing achievements, some of the writing achievements.

334
00:35:06,583 --> 00:35:13,046
Certainly this is not encompassing every achievement of the year, but some of the ones that we haven't had a chance to honor.

335
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:17,484
And so we do have the Boston Playwrights Theater's Young Playwrights Project.

336
00:35:17,905 --> 00:35:22,855
Why don't I read the names and then people could stand after, would that work for the group, the committee?

337
00:35:23,399 --> 00:35:23,840
Okay, great.

338
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:42,017
So for the Boston Playwrights Theater's Young Playwrights Project, we have Michaela Callahan, Mandy Chow, Julia Hanratty, Kian Liu, Jonah Segal, Bethea Pierce, Kira Tramble, Stanley Sunwoo, Becky Wang, and Maria Zara.

339
00:35:42,037 --> 00:35:46,902
And we wanna thank Mr. Bowen Flynn for supporting the students throughout that.

340
00:35:47,402 --> 00:35:51,405
We were also able to have the Shakespearean monologue competition.

341
00:35:51,765 --> 00:36:04,073
We had one of our students who's here tonight, Jonah Siegel, who spoke so eloquently, really advanced quite far and Mr. Bowen Flynn and all of us were just so proud of the efforts.

342
00:36:04,733 --> 00:36:15,016
For Boston Globe Scholastic Writing Award, we have our student here tonight, Christine Dehotel, who received both an honorable mention and a silver key.

343
00:36:15,536 --> 00:36:20,518
She is a student of Mr. Ambrose, who shared with me today that she has a whole collection of writings.

344
00:36:20,598 --> 00:36:24,859
So we're very excited to see future works down the line, hopefully.

345
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:29,581
And finally, we have the Immigration Learning Center Teen Perspective.

346
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:31,202
We had three students from Ms.

347
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:32,102
Sanford's class.

348
00:36:33,021 --> 00:36:37,964
receive awards, Mosamed Habiba, Michael Pak, Madgulat Takele.

349
00:36:38,204 --> 00:36:43,406
So if we could have the students that were able to come tonight stand and honor them, thank you so much and congratulations.

350
00:36:59,895 --> 00:37:01,936
And of course, thank you to their teachers as well.

351
00:37:02,813 --> 00:37:04,916
The next slide is our students in action.

352
00:37:05,136 --> 00:37:15,872
So every year we have the opportunity to have some students go and actually go to different activities where they can engage in government actions.

353
00:37:16,825 --> 00:37:19,286
We had the MASC Day on the Hill.

354
00:37:20,046 --> 00:37:23,387
We had four students attend with Mr. Bowen Flynn.

355
00:37:24,027 --> 00:37:28,749
And we also wanted to give a special thank you to the school committee members who took, who were able to attend.

356
00:37:29,429 --> 00:37:35,371
Committee member Graham, Reinfeld, and Rousseau, as well as Senator Jalen for supporting the students at the event.

357
00:37:36,191 --> 00:37:41,493
The students that were chosen for that were Mandy Chow, Ann Dupes, Sierra Isbell, and Jonah Segal.

358
00:37:42,333 --> 00:37:43,014
Segal, sorry.

359
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:48,016
In addition to that, and I'm sorry, I know I'm talking fast, I'll slow down.

360
00:37:48,036 --> 00:37:50,818
I just want to make sure I get through the names.

361
00:37:51,418 --> 00:38:01,004
We also had students participate in Student Government Day, and we do have pictures up there showing them in action as they attended Government Day.

362
00:38:01,464 --> 00:38:04,165
That was Helen Lucas and Noah Urosofsky.

363
00:38:05,126 --> 00:38:07,749
Oh, sorry, you're Osco, I apologize.

364
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:14,337
And Mr. Bowen Flynn, who's our English teacher, was able to accompany them, said what a wonderful day it was for them.

365
00:38:14,918 --> 00:38:16,941
And we were appreciative of their time as well.

366
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:29,576
We also had the geography be at our middle school, and we had finalists come and attend, and we had some really strong winners come out of that.

367
00:38:29,957 --> 00:38:34,019
We shared with you in the narrative some of the questions that they had to answer.

368
00:38:34,039 --> 00:38:36,320
They were superb.

369
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:41,483
So we did want to take a minute to recognize Joe Hogan, Richard Mongol,

370
00:38:42,105 --> 00:38:53,432
Stanley Tong, and Stefano Lozaro, who achieved first place, Elliot Traber-Hill, who achieved second place, and Emmett Berryman, who achieved third place.

371
00:38:53,933 --> 00:38:59,236
We are really, really proud of them, really proud of Mr. McCarthy, Mr. Villard, Ms.

372
00:38:59,296 --> 00:39:02,939
O'Donohue, and Mr. Zizzo for supporting them through this.

373
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:12,276
So all the students who I just named, if they could take a moment, if they're here, and we could maybe congratulate them for such an excellent job well done, that would be wonderful.

374
00:39:28,635 --> 00:39:38,977
I should also mention that they will be receiving certificates within their buildings, just not tonight in the interest of just a lot of wonderful success stories.

375
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:45,696
The next event that we wanted to make sure we recognized were our simulations.

376
00:39:45,996 --> 00:39:54,165
So we have a few different groups that engage in various simulations through clubs or through classroom activities.

377
00:39:54,906 --> 00:39:57,288
And we begin with our model United Nations.

378
00:39:57,809 --> 00:40:01,173
This year model United Nations was run by Mr. Matthew Brophy.

379
00:40:02,093 --> 00:40:22,519
And he did it as more of an after school activity and he accomplished so many wonderful things that I did share with you in the narratives, but we were really proud of him to be able to do this after school as opposed to in class, and he you approved the Dartmouth overnight field trip they had a wonderful time and did quite well.

380
00:40:23,206 --> 00:40:25,007
They have an amazing team.

381
00:40:25,187 --> 00:40:33,192
I've put a picture in the background for you, and I'll just read the names through, and hopefully those who are here can be honored.

382
00:40:33,613 --> 00:40:42,638
So we have Emma Ben-Wi, Man Chow, Shahan Qadri, who did receive an Honorable Mention recipient at one of the simulations.

383
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:46,601
Brian DiPlazido, who received a People's Choice Award.

384
00:40:47,561 --> 00:40:48,322
Jack Dodd,

385
00:40:48,815 --> 00:41:06,384
And oops, Yamilee Etienne, Sierra Godley, Bridget Inman, Sierra Isbell, Mohammed Jamaldeen, Sean Johnson, Margaret Carroll, Leanne Lam, Evan Russell, Kira Tremble, Kiana Tran, Darren Truong,

386
00:41:06,943 --> 00:41:14,606
who also received both a Model United Nations Outstanding Delegate and Best Orator recipient, both two awards.

387
00:41:15,727 --> 00:41:25,331
Daviana Vega, Jaden Ville, Noah Urasco, and Maria Zasra, I'm having trouble tonight, sorry, Zasra, I apologize.

388
00:41:26,332 --> 00:41:30,694
They did an amazing job, love the energy, and a huge thank you to Mr. Brophy as well.

389
00:41:30,914 --> 00:41:35,636
If anyone's here tonight, if they'd like to stand to be honored, we would love to congratulate you for all of your efforts.

390
00:41:51,764 --> 00:41:58,332
Okay, and last but not least, we have our mock trial and our ethics bowl.

391
00:41:59,053 --> 00:42:05,921
Our mock trial, as you read in the narrative, engaged in multiple trials throughout the school year.

392
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:09,265
They were led by our advisor, Ms.

393
00:42:09,305 --> 00:42:09,825
Dineu, and they,

394
00:42:12,489 --> 00:42:25,355
both worked in the classroom to prepare for these mock trials, as well as after school, and then were able to really go in, get different points based on their arguments, and achieve some very strong success.

395
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:41,922
Participants in mock trial were Michelle Began, Genevieve Blatt, Eric Brown, Michael Koday, Clay Canavan, Nathan Chevalier, Sophia DeMillo, Brian DiPlacido, Gavin Gain,

396
00:42:42,932 --> 00:42:59,279
DeFord Guerra, Nathaniel Hopper, Maria Lima Costa, Helen Lucas, Anna Sophia Marrera, Madeline Morris, Theodore Norton, Mark Parr, Tenzin Richen, and Christopher Rothermel.

397
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,541
And then we had our EPICS Bowl, which I've already presented on before.

398
00:43:04,962 --> 00:43:08,583
And thanks to your generosity, they did go to nationals.

399
00:43:08,823 --> 00:43:10,264
They had a wonderful time.

400
00:43:10,814 --> 00:43:14,256
They performed exceptionally well, as you read.

401
00:43:15,356 --> 00:43:21,880
And we just wanted to take, again, I know I already thanked you, but we are very appreciative of your support for that trip.

402
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:25,002
And I wanted to read the names of the students who attended.

403
00:43:25,022 --> 00:43:34,567
So we have Sonia Benapal, Anne Dupes, Andre Duriti, Claire Gingo, Amira Laflam, Carmen Morgante,

404
00:43:35,097 --> 00:43:40,961
Bahaba Sahil, and we also have our wonderful advisor, Mr. Esner.

405
00:43:41,422 --> 00:43:48,927
I also failed to mention in the slide previous to that, for Model UN, the other advisor in addition to Mr. Brophy is Ms.

406
00:43:48,967 --> 00:43:50,088
Gates.

407
00:43:50,248 --> 00:43:56,153
If you could stand, if you were able to attend, and we could honor you and thank you for all of your hard work.

408
00:44:15,131 --> 00:44:22,356
Thank you again for your time, for supporting these students, and a huge congratulations to the students, the teachers, and everybody else.

409
00:44:22,496 --> 00:44:23,256
Thank you so much.

410
00:44:23,376 --> 00:44:28,279
I'm happy to answer any questions, but yeah, I'm happy to answer any questions.

411
00:44:28,459 --> 00:44:28,740
Thank you.

412
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,000
Great presentation.

413
00:44:30,061 --> 00:44:30,801
Congratulations.

414
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:31,321
Thank you.

415
00:44:31,601 --> 00:44:32,302
Thank you very much.

416
00:44:36,565 --> 00:44:39,667
I noticed a few people stood up more than once too, so we'll get some.

417
00:44:41,069 --> 00:44:42,490
Great students, well-rounded.

418
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:46,813
We have our Medford High School update and survey results.

419
00:44:47,033 --> 00:44:47,974
Our principal, Ms.

420
00:44:48,014 --> 00:44:49,174
Manta Cabral, welcome.

421
00:44:49,194 --> 00:45:05,985
Am I on?

422
00:45:06,406 --> 00:45:06,546
Yes.

423
00:45:08,925 --> 00:45:13,750
Good evening, Mayor, members of the School Committee, and Superintendent, Dr. Eduardo Vinson.

424
00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:22,839
It is hard to believe that in less than two weeks, we'll be wishing our seniors well as they cross the stage to graduate and continue on with post-secondary in our careers.

425
00:45:23,459 --> 00:45:32,188
The end of the school year is a busy time with exams, events, and celebrations, but it's also a time to reflect on the accomplishments and growth of the school.

426
00:45:38,973 --> 00:45:41,356
Tonight, we'll review and highlight the school year.

427
00:45:41,576 --> 00:45:52,550
Specifically, we'll review the culture and climate survey, share new core values and community norms, highlight the accomplishments of our CTE programs, along with what is next for MHS.

428
00:45:54,158 --> 00:46:06,012
The Culture and Climate Survey was administered in May of 2023, 2024, sorry, was administered in May of 2023 and again most recently in late April of 2024.

429
00:46:06,593 --> 00:46:13,861
A total of 711 MHS students in grades 9 through 12 participated in the survey during advisory block.

430
00:46:14,722 --> 00:46:31,520
The survey is composed of eight categories, cultural awareness and action, diversity and inclusion, school belonging, school climate, school engagement, school safety, student teacher relationships, and valuing of school.

431
00:46:32,642 --> 00:46:42,633
When presented with the 2022-2023 school year data, MHS identified and shared at a previous school committee member three categories.

432
00:46:43,313 --> 00:46:49,961
The categories included areas of strength, areas with varied results, and areas for growth.

433
00:46:51,283 --> 00:46:56,108
In slides six through eight, I've provided statistical comparison between the two years.

434
00:46:56,669 --> 00:47:12,325
It's important to note that Panorama, the survey platform, identifies increases of more than two percentage points as statistically significant, meaning it could have not happened by chance based on our survey size.

435
00:47:13,587 --> 00:47:20,992
I've identified questions from the survey to share with you tonight and represent areas of strength and continued areas of growth for Medford High School.

436
00:47:21,972 --> 00:47:28,817
As shown on slide six, school belonging is how much students feel they're valued members of the school community.

437
00:47:29,437 --> 00:47:32,699
In all three questions, students showed 5% or more increase from the 2022-2023 school year.

438
00:47:37,362 --> 00:47:38,282
School engagement.

439
00:47:38,863 --> 00:47:42,444
Students' attentiveness and investment in school remain stable at 91%.

440
00:47:42,584 --> 00:47:46,125
And lastly, valuing of school.

441
00:47:46,465 --> 00:47:51,907
How much students feel that school is interesting, important, and useful showed an increase of between 7 to 9%.

442
00:47:54,795 --> 00:47:57,396
And slide seven, student-teacher relationships.

443
00:47:58,157 --> 00:48:04,380
Strength of the social connections between students and teachers within and beyond school.

444
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:14,265
This year, I would identify student-teacher relationships as a strength at MHS, with an eight to 10% increase in the five questions shared.

445
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:17,927
This is a testament to the dedication of our valued faculty.

446
00:48:18,988 --> 00:48:24,750
School safety demonstrated a 9-15% shift in the questions identified.

447
00:48:25,490 --> 00:48:36,554
Students at school feel safe, students at this school get along with each other, students at school threaten to hurt other students, and students at this school fight a lot.

448
00:48:37,235 --> 00:48:40,996
I consider school safety to remain in the varied results category.

449
00:48:42,395 --> 00:48:53,843
On slide eight, school climate, overall social and learning climate of the school, this category showed significant growth from the 2022-2023 school year.

450
00:48:54,343 --> 00:49:09,494
The questions with the greatest change are, adults at this school reward students for positive behavior, students at this school try to work out their disagreements with other students by talking to them, and school rules and discipline are applied equally and fairly.

451
00:49:10,819 --> 00:49:18,442
Lastly, cultural awareness and action, along with diversity inclusion, show that they are trending in a positive direction.

452
00:49:19,722 --> 00:49:25,084
Medford High School has focused on creating environments where students feel welcomed, supported, and safe.

453
00:49:25,724 --> 00:49:35,768
We've made an assertive effort and commitment to hear students and staff voices, and have not only listened, but made changes at MHS to incorporate feedback and suggestions.

454
00:49:36,488 --> 00:49:39,630
We held more community gatherings to build school spirit and pride.

455
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:53,998
We worked together on core values and have continuously incorporated restorative practices into our work with students, along with providing professional development on restorative and tiered model intervention strategies in the classroom.

456
00:49:54,978 --> 00:50:07,509
We understand that culture and climate shifts at Medford High School will take time, but we're committed to providing an inclusive, safe, and academically rigorous learning environment that our students and staff deserve.

457
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:15,036
I'm pleased to see the positive shifts are being made and that growth is noted over an 11th month span between surveys.

458
00:50:15,616 --> 00:50:20,861
Consensus among educational researchers note a three to five year period for change.

459
00:50:24,867 --> 00:50:30,611
Shifting to some of the work done this year, together as students and staff, we developed our new core values.

460
00:50:30,952 --> 00:50:40,038
After conversations and advisory and small group panels, students selected the three core values of respect, responsibility, and empathy and kindness.

461
00:50:40,659 --> 00:50:48,245
For staff, we held a workshop along with discussion and house meetings and surveys to identify the three shared core values.

462
00:50:48,945 --> 00:50:53,231
Community norms were developed in January and discussed as a community and advisory.

463
00:50:53,251 --> 00:50:57,657
We started working on a shared vision, along with a portrait of a graduate.

464
00:50:59,219 --> 00:51:06,208
At this time, I'm going to pause and I'm going to hand it over to Mr. Fallon to highlight our CTE programs and students.

465
00:51:11,237 --> 00:51:14,578
Good evening, Madam Superintendent, Madam Mayor, members of the School Committee.

466
00:51:14,598 --> 00:51:17,919
I'm going to provide a brief update on career and technical education for this year.

467
00:51:19,019 --> 00:51:23,561
We did have 304 students, which was our highest number ever, participate in Freshman Exploratory.

468
00:51:24,221 --> 00:51:30,483
Of those students, 185 were placed in CTE programs, and 72 students chose a traditional high school pathway.

469
00:51:31,363 --> 00:51:33,704
At this time, we have 47 students on a wait list.

470
00:51:34,602 --> 00:51:36,863
For cooperative education, we had 58 students.

471
00:51:37,143 --> 00:51:42,405
Some of our stellar juniors who are ready ahead of time are out working and making money.

472
00:51:42,945 --> 00:51:46,247
Over 50 employee partners make up our partnerships now.

473
00:51:46,807 --> 00:51:49,848
Many of our seniors will continue employment after their graduation.

474
00:51:50,248 --> 00:51:56,631
And two companies that I know of as of this week have offered complete college tuition for these two students that are working.

475
00:51:56,651 --> 00:51:57,311
So that's exciting.

476
00:51:59,213 --> 00:52:01,014
Some more updates, if you could click the link.

477
00:52:01,614 --> 00:52:08,657
I've been talking about the sheds the few times I've been in front of you, and I think that's another good time to highlight what our students can do in the community.

478
00:52:12,198 --> 00:52:20,282
So we started pretty basic, and as you'll see, the pictures, as they increase, they've become a little bit better each time, because practice makes perfect.

479
00:52:20,302 --> 00:52:22,903
So that's what we call a man cave at this point, or woman cave.

480
00:52:25,885 --> 00:52:27,607
That was a shed that they just did recently.

481
00:52:27,647 --> 00:52:28,868
That's at the Andrew School.

482
00:52:28,969 --> 00:52:34,555
So just to give you an idea of our carpentry students, it's our version of a house building project, but a little bit smaller.

483
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:39,802
In health assisting, we had seven of our students pass their CNA exam.

484
00:52:40,182 --> 00:52:42,364
We have one certified dental assistant now.

485
00:52:43,304 --> 00:52:50,869
We are finding success with the Bunker Hill Community College dual enrollment program, and we're exploring a new partnership for clinical rotations with Winchester Hospital.

486
00:52:51,690 --> 00:53:01,716
Our construction and craft laborer students, the picture on the right, received their hoisting apprenticeship license this past week, and 15 students were inducted into the National Technical Honor Society.

487
00:53:02,725 --> 00:53:07,530
For our electrical students, two students have been chosen to join the IBEW electrical union.

488
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:12,094
Nine students will be entering the workforce as apprentices immediately after graduation.

489
00:53:12,775 --> 00:53:20,363
Pictured in the lower right is a picture of our graphic design program that made the Mustang pride t-shirt for some new swag that can be sold in the Mustang mall.

490
00:53:23,439 --> 00:53:29,501
Two more things to share with you tonight, one being the biodiesel project that was a collaborative effort between multiple CTE programs.

491
00:53:29,521 --> 00:53:32,622
So this all started by collecting waste vegetable oil from culinary.

492
00:53:33,122 --> 00:53:37,624
Biotech students began the process of converting and using the cooking oil into clean burning fuel.

493
00:53:38,304 --> 00:53:46,587
Then the students proceeded to learn and master the techniques to how to successfully produce several gallons of refined biodiesel, which burns cleaner than regular diesel fuel.

494
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:52,250
They also received a $2,000 grant from the Medford Educational Foundation to help pay for supplies.

495
00:53:53,010 --> 00:54:00,334
Metal Fab and Auto Tech completed an engine swap of a go-kart, and Business Marketing explored the feasibility of starting a biodiesel production business.

496
00:54:00,874 --> 00:54:08,118
They also took a field trip to the biodiesel factory, Northeast Biodiesel, which is out in Greenfield, to observe it on a much larger scale.

497
00:54:09,336 --> 00:54:14,260
Coral Chavez will present our biodiesel project at the MAVA Connecting for Success conference in June.

498
00:54:15,021 --> 00:54:20,765
Along with that, if you're in the neighborhood, Friday, we're having an open house of sorts to showcase some of our students' accomplishments this year.

499
00:54:21,005 --> 00:54:22,927
We will be highlighting the biodiesel project.

500
00:54:24,888 --> 00:54:34,556
The last thing I'd like to share, and if members of the team are here, if you could come up and join me, is to honor our robotics team, who has once again, are they here?

501
00:54:40,461 --> 00:54:46,944
So this is the third year in a row that our students have competed.

502
00:54:46,984 --> 00:54:47,984
Let me get my notes here.

503
00:54:48,844 --> 00:54:50,005
And I wanna honor the students.

504
00:54:50,025 --> 00:54:56,348
So I'm thrilled to announce that Medford's MVTHS Mate Robotics team has again won the Mate Rove New England Regional Championship.

505
00:54:56,908 --> 00:55:02,150
This year, they narrowly edged out Phillips Exeter Academy by a score of 445 to 437.

506
00:55:02,930 --> 00:55:08,593
Now they'll be representing New England at the competition in Tennessee, correct?

507
00:55:09,793 --> 00:55:22,873
I'd like to honor Tim Hunt, Ben Santana, Miles Hilliard, Scott Campbell, Jonas Wurz, Matt Harris, Aaron Van Daniel, Zach Bertocchi, Franklin Soto-Ortiz, Noah Reed, and Ben Wertz.

508
00:55:22,993 --> 00:55:23,574
Congratulations.

509
00:55:37,116 --> 00:55:40,437
I never even try to explain anything in engineering and robotics.

510
00:55:40,557 --> 00:55:43,917
I leave it for the students, so please tell us what you did.

511
00:55:43,937 --> 00:55:51,699
Hey there, I'm Matty Harris, member of SecRobotics, obviously, our MVTHS robotics team.

512
00:55:52,079 --> 00:56:05,062
As we mentioned, we compete in the MATE ROV competition, and so we design underwater robots that are designed to compete in a competition where we perform tasks that mimic real world environmental tasks like

513
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:18,830
like cleaning up, say, trash from the ocean, or finding data on marine life, improving habitats, and stuff like that.

514
00:56:19,890 --> 00:56:28,836
It's a really amazing experience, combination of a lot of different disciplines in engineering, hardware, electrical, software.

515
00:56:29,776 --> 00:56:32,597
I found it to be a really awesome learning experience.

516
00:56:33,797 --> 00:56:43,801
And we also like to acknowledge that we couldn't do this without the support of our vocational teachers, Mr. Christie, he spent countless hours with us and Ms.

517
00:56:43,821 --> 00:56:48,922
Miller as well, our programming teacher, and say it's a really great opportunity.

518
00:56:48,942 --> 00:56:49,763
I'm very thankful.

519
00:56:49,783 --> 00:56:50,343
Thank you.

520
00:57:00,512 --> 00:57:02,014
Also, I just wanna thank Ms.

521
00:57:02,054 --> 00:57:07,339
Rachel Perry, who was really good in helping us find some lanes in the pool to test our robots.

522
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,081
So thank you, Rachel, for that.

523
00:57:09,862 --> 00:57:10,983
Okay, back to you, Marta.

524
00:57:13,006 --> 00:57:13,606
All right.

525
00:57:15,188 --> 00:57:16,109
So I believe we're on slide 14.

526
00:57:20,433 --> 00:57:30,521
So alongside school site council for Medford High School and aligned with the district strategic plan we identified this year for strategic priorities for MHS.

527
00:57:32,381 --> 00:57:35,663
and they're included in the school improvement plan for Medford High School.

528
00:57:36,243 --> 00:57:46,189
This plan will span over three years and the four priorities are as followed that we want to improve or to improve student academic and technical achievement.

529
00:57:46,769 --> 00:57:53,312
The second is to implement practices to ensure a safe, inclusive and supportive school climate and culture for all community members.

530
00:57:53,873 --> 00:57:58,395
Number three is to improve community engagement and collaboration and routine regular

531
00:57:58,915 --> 00:58:12,171
and transparent communications with all stakeholders in Medford, and to create a strategic list of facility needs in order to provide students and staff with clean, safe, and academically conducive learning environment.

532
00:58:12,492 --> 00:58:14,995
So those can be found in the school improvement plan.

533
00:58:17,307 --> 00:58:28,565
On slide 15, I would like to update on the status of the Welsh report recommendations that were provided last year and that were reviewed at the beginning of this school year.

534
00:58:31,701 --> 00:58:36,544
For the first recommendation, a creation of MHS committees were recommended.

535
00:58:36,924 --> 00:58:44,969
There were a total of four that were recommended to the school and to the committee, them being safety and security team.

536
00:58:45,369 --> 00:58:50,933
We have implemented this by weekly meetings with our SRO, administration and director of school counseling.

537
00:58:51,393 --> 00:58:57,497
Monthly meetings are also held with the district attorney's office to discuss support for youth in Medford.

538
00:58:58,584 --> 00:59:02,306
Diversity, equity, and inclusion committee was recommended.

539
00:59:02,726 --> 00:59:07,928
We've not formalized a committee yet, but we'll have one implemented for the 24-25 school year.

540
00:59:08,229 --> 00:59:12,911
We recognize and believe that inclusion, diversity, and equity need to be at the center of our work.

541
00:59:14,278 --> 00:59:17,560
Community on norms for student behavior, shared values.

542
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:31,609
This is something that we decided to do as a whole school and to develop shared norms and shared core values along with as a whole school have a shared vision for next year along with a portrait of a graduate.

543
00:59:32,509 --> 00:59:39,594
And lastly, the schedule committee, a consultant was hired by MPS and we're continuing to review their recommendations for implementation.

544
00:59:41,328 --> 00:59:48,717
The second recommendation was to provide more opportunities for teachers input and decision making and build relationships between teachers and administration.

545
00:59:49,618 --> 01:00:00,010
Feedback is continuously incorporated into all staff meetings, along with processes on how to collect feedback and suggestions throughout the year virtually.

546
01:00:01,147 --> 01:00:15,276
Number three, parent caregiver surveys about culture and climate and MHS during the 2023 2024 school year, we're currently working on creating this survey and distributing it at the end of the school year to our caregivers and parents.

547
01:00:16,249 --> 01:00:19,912
Number four, MHS associate or assistant principal.

548
01:00:20,473 --> 01:00:31,001
We did shift administration and we did hire a assistant principal for operations and school and student engagement.

549
01:00:31,402 --> 01:00:38,308
Sorry, operations and student engagement, who is now part of the administrative team at Medford High School.

550
01:00:39,008 --> 01:00:50,352
Mentoring for new administrators, new assistant principals attended this year the regional AP conference, and mentoring is continuously provided to APs through both Chad and myself.

551
01:00:51,172 --> 01:00:57,434
They also attended workshops and other professional development opportunities offered to APs in our region.

552
01:00:57,454 --> 01:01:06,257
MPS has also provided me with a coach this year, which has been wonderful through the School Administrator Association.

553
01:01:08,582 --> 01:01:14,926
Lastly, the last slide is thoughts for the horizon.

554
01:01:15,606 --> 01:01:20,669
Medford High School, and this is a program proposal that we would like to pilot at the high school.

555
01:01:21,509 --> 01:01:29,474
Medford High School has identified a need for an alternative program for at-risk students who do not qualify for special education at the high school.

556
01:01:29,554 --> 01:01:33,176
Currently, we have the therapeutic learning program, but we're looking at

557
01:01:34,056 --> 01:01:38,959
piloting a alternative program within the high school for our students.

558
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:51,428
These students are currently not making adequate academic progress and they've been identified, are repeating a grade for the first and or second time, so they're overage, undercredited, and are at risk of dropping out due to that.

559
01:01:52,068 --> 01:02:02,216
Their struggles consist of student-related, family-related, school-related, or community-related barriers that we have identified that are hindering their academic progress towards graduation.

560
01:02:02,857 --> 01:02:21,472
By creating an alternative setting, we're able to individualize education, provide supports towards graduation and graduating with their cohort, and we're able to be more flexible in understanding student barriers that are preventing them from making the academic progress that they need in order to graduate on time.

561
01:02:23,419 --> 01:02:40,863
At this time, we have concluded our presentation, but most importantly, and probably the most exciting part of this time in May is the commencement ceremony that is quickly approaching as our seniors, the class of 2024 are about to graduate.

562
01:02:41,263 --> 01:02:48,265
So we would like to formally invite you to June 5th at Formel Stadium for the graduation of the class of 2024.

563
01:02:50,748 --> 01:02:57,832
I thank you for your continued support and if you have any questions or comments, or we could take them offline.

564
01:02:58,212 --> 01:02:59,213
Thank you for the report.

565
01:03:01,674 --> 01:03:11,260
The headliner for me was actually the survey, and while there's lots of good stuff in there, but in the survey data, everything went in the right direction, everything.

566
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:14,221
And I think that's really awesome.

567
01:03:21,972 --> 01:03:27,975
This is your first principal ship right first, so I think there's, you should be very proud.

568
01:03:28,115 --> 01:03:44,604
I mean, one, not even a full school year, and it's, I'm impressed so I just, there's a lot in here that's, we could talk all night about but the survey data I've been waiting with bated breath, and thank you for the great work you've been doing, and I look forward to what you can do in the future.

569
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:48,321
Thank you, I couldn't do it without the staff and with students this year.

570
01:03:48,341 --> 01:03:51,961
They've been extremely supportive and they've really rolled their sleeves up.

571
01:03:52,242 --> 01:03:57,043
The staff at MHS and and really taking this on with me because it's for our students.

572
01:03:57,123 --> 01:03:58,243
So I thank them.

573
01:03:58,283 --> 01:04:02,564
I know there's several in the room, but I really do thank them because I couldn't have done it on my own.

574
01:04:02,604 --> 01:04:04,184
Neither could chat or the admin team.

575
01:04:07,385 --> 01:04:08,685
Member Graham and member Bramley.

576
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:10,540
Thank you.

577
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:15,342
I just had a couple of questions about the alternative program proposal.

578
01:04:15,362 --> 01:04:35,110
This actually came up when we were having some discussions to start to feed some of the work that we have to do for MSBA to describe the kind of programming that happens currently in the building, and then also start to think about what programming would we want to have happen in the building, and Ms.

579
01:04:35,150 --> 01:04:36,291
Cabral brought this forward.

580
01:04:36,994 --> 01:04:43,261
and I asked her to share her thoughts with all of us so that we could understand sort of the goals here.

581
01:04:43,341 --> 01:04:57,738
So can you talk a little bit about this, when you think you can do this and the staffing that you think you need in order to do it and any other like barriers that are in your way of helping these students right now?

582
01:04:59,383 --> 01:05:03,228
Yes, so I did propose two models of how it could work.

583
01:05:03,409 --> 01:05:09,898
One is to have a humanities, to have less staff and have a humanities and a STEM teacher.

584
01:05:10,498 --> 01:05:13,963
And then the other one is to have four core academics in the classroom.

585
01:05:16,761 --> 01:05:33,031
We have identified students like I had mentioned that are over age undercredited and there's an urgency to get them through the 10th grade, we know that once we get students through the 10th grade their graduation rate is much higher than if they were to repeat ninth grade or repeat.

586
01:05:33,351 --> 01:05:36,513
twice ninth grade, which we do have students on track to do that.

587
01:05:37,014 --> 01:05:54,026
So when it comes to barriers that I have currently, it would definitely be staffing and strategically looking at how that staffing may work in order to best support the students because I don't want to create a program that is not fully supportive of the needs that they they currently need each day.

588
01:05:55,507 --> 01:06:02,513
And then also space, we would need to look at the space and where that would be best placed within the high school.

589
01:06:02,873 --> 01:06:13,081
I have lots of ideas for when we reimagine the high school, but there is an urgency right now based off the data that we're presented with, with some of our students that are at risk for dropping out.

590
01:06:14,402 --> 01:06:20,046
And so do you think that you can start this program next year and

591
01:06:22,685 --> 01:06:27,027
Is that reflected in your current scheduling dynamic?

592
01:06:27,347 --> 01:06:29,789
So we're currently still doing the schedule.

593
01:06:29,969 --> 01:06:36,932
I hope to identify if we can and propose to central office if we do have staffing that would allow for it.

594
01:06:38,033 --> 01:06:45,157
We are also at the moment identifying teachers that can provide interventions to all MHS students.

595
01:06:45,497 --> 01:06:50,880
So it's a little bit of a puzzle piece right now as to if we have the current staffing needed.

596
01:06:51,440 --> 01:07:01,849
If we do have the current staffing needed, I would like to take a very small cohort of students and be able to do something and pilot it within this school year, within the coming school year.

597
01:07:03,670 --> 01:07:12,418
But it really, I will not know until probably the next two weeks when it comes to that, because I do wanna provide interventions for math and ELA support for all students.

598
01:07:14,479 --> 01:07:17,362
I just wanna say that this is the kind of strategic

599
01:07:19,110 --> 01:07:25,292
project and initiative that the committee has sort of been begging to be put forward from the high school campus.

600
01:07:25,552 --> 01:07:36,795
And I'm just so happy to hear that we are looking at the data, we are identifying students that are at risk, and we know how specifically to help them and where and when to intervene.

601
01:07:38,476 --> 01:07:43,439
that's since I have been on the school committee, I have like literally been waiting for this presentation.

602
01:07:43,479 --> 01:07:45,700
So I'm so happy that it's finally here.

603
01:07:45,740 --> 01:07:48,522
And it's only been four and a half years, and it's not been a decade.

604
01:07:49,042 --> 01:07:55,205
But I do want to sort of like we're all here, but this room is full, because we're having a budget presentation soon.

605
01:07:55,285 --> 01:08:04,750
So I would like to make a motion that Miss Cabral gets the staffing that she needs to pilot this program next year, no matter what happens with the budget.

606
01:08:04,770 --> 01:08:07,672
I'll second that.

607
01:08:09,901 --> 01:08:13,047
Motion by Member Graham, seconded by Member Bramley.

608
01:08:13,067 --> 01:08:14,430
All those in favor?

609
01:08:14,450 --> 01:08:15,111
Aye.

610
01:08:15,933 --> 01:08:16,594
All those opposed?

611
01:08:17,696 --> 01:08:18,378
Motion passes.

612
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:20,061
Thank you, that's it.

613
01:08:20,682 --> 01:08:20,943
Thank you.

614
01:08:21,163 --> 01:08:21,704
Member Bramley?

615
01:08:24,158 --> 01:08:26,360
I think I may be one of your biggest fans.

616
01:08:26,801 --> 01:08:30,865
I've said from day one that I thought you were unicorn, I was on the committee to hire you.

617
01:08:30,885 --> 01:08:40,775
Remember Graham was there also there was there was maybe 10 to 15 of us that were in that room when you came into interview, and you walked out and there was this silence.

618
01:08:42,216 --> 01:08:46,498
And I remember just saying, if all of you don't wanna give her a hug right now, I'm moving.

619
01:08:47,859 --> 01:08:52,581
And luckily you are still the unicorn and I just can, I don't wanna become emotional.

620
01:08:52,601 --> 01:08:53,802
I promise I would never cry here.

621
01:08:53,882 --> 01:08:57,023
And every time, every week I say, I'm not gonna cry.

622
01:08:57,744 --> 01:09:01,005
But these are happy, happy, this makes me very, very happy.

623
01:09:01,066 --> 01:09:03,667
I have really, really pushed for accountability in this district.

624
01:09:04,707 --> 01:09:10,670
I have really begged for safety, accountability, yes, more than anything.

625
01:09:12,096 --> 01:09:14,718
I'm proud of you, I thank you so much, I really do.

626
01:09:14,778 --> 01:09:18,380
You and Chad are rock stars in my book, so thank you very much.

627
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:19,081
I'm still not gonna cry.

628
01:09:20,542 --> 01:09:24,964
But I think that there's always still work to be done.

629
01:09:25,004 --> 01:09:30,648
The amount of emails that we get about day-to-day basis things that are happening in the building still concern me.

630
01:09:30,788 --> 01:09:35,972
I'm not trying to be a Debbie Downer by any means because I am really Medford's cheerleader here.

631
01:09:36,552 --> 01:09:40,515
But I just wanna make sure that we don't lose sight of the day-to-day

632
01:09:41,215 --> 01:09:42,096
things that are going on.

633
01:09:43,556 --> 01:09:46,318
The Welch page was not in our packet.

634
01:09:47,098 --> 01:09:48,179
Can we have a copy?

635
01:09:48,459 --> 01:09:48,739
Yes.

636
01:09:48,919 --> 01:09:52,501
Okay, we'll reshare that that was asked to be added yesterday.

637
01:09:52,601 --> 01:09:53,822
So we added it this morning.

638
01:09:54,282 --> 01:09:55,023
Yeah.

639
01:09:55,423 --> 01:09:55,743
Awesome.

640
01:09:56,023 --> 01:09:56,443
Thank you.

641
01:09:56,643 --> 01:09:57,344
Thank you.

642
01:09:57,364 --> 01:09:57,744
Thank you.

643
01:09:58,584 --> 01:09:59,305
Keep up the great work.

644
01:10:00,421 --> 01:10:01,021
Member Rheintald?

645
01:10:01,381 --> 01:10:03,662
Yeah, I have a question about the survey.

646
01:10:03,902 --> 01:10:07,083
So I was also incredibly encouraged by the numbers.

647
01:10:07,303 --> 01:10:25,750
I am wondering if there's gonna be any effort to break down particularly cultural awareness and action and diversity inclusion, those questions by some of the more vulnerable populations to see whether the average across the student population may not be representative of those people who are often targeted by some of these challenges.

648
01:10:25,770 --> 01:10:29,391
So I'm wondering if we can look a little more closely to see

649
01:10:30,877 --> 01:10:33,098
what that sub data looks like there.

650
01:10:33,379 --> 01:10:34,459
Yes, I can't agree more.

651
01:10:34,539 --> 01:10:36,821
We had a very quick turnaround for the presentation.

652
01:10:36,881 --> 01:10:40,443
We really just did like an overall brief summary.

653
01:10:40,483 --> 01:10:45,146
We really do need to break it down in order to continue making shifts and progress.

654
01:10:45,206 --> 01:10:51,990
So yes, that will be done over the summer months to really focus in and hone in on to the work that we need to do.

655
01:10:52,530 --> 01:10:52,870
I agree.

656
01:10:53,351 --> 01:10:53,791
Thank you.

657
01:10:53,991 --> 01:11:06,400
And then this might be a question for the superintendent so the Welch report had a lot of focus on the high school on there was also some of this mentoring for other schools in the district and looking at climate, kind of, more broadly across the district.

658
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:09,262
And so I'm wondering what's happening on that front.

659
01:11:12,987 --> 01:11:29,744
So we are definitely primary focus this year really was the high school to get it up and running and have it be a different experience for and staff within the building which this current survey reflects.

660
01:11:30,965 --> 01:11:47,075
The broad feedback from the Welsh report, we did not do panorama surveys in the other schools to be able to say this is concrete data, but we do have support for some of the new administrators who did come on board.

661
01:11:49,376 --> 01:12:02,606
global context, there has been support and implementation, but the real focus this year for us was the high school to really see this data shift and start to move in the right direction.

662
01:12:02,846 --> 01:12:07,109
And we're all very, very pleased that that's what is happening right now.

663
01:12:07,369 --> 01:12:08,149
Yeah, absolutely.

664
01:12:08,209 --> 01:12:09,490
I agree completely.

665
01:12:09,690 --> 01:12:16,032
And I just want to make on record the comment that our, you know, our middle school students are the next high schoolers and elementary.

666
01:12:16,052 --> 01:12:19,053
So this all this work really has to be district wide.

667
01:12:19,193 --> 01:12:20,793
And I'm so encouraged by this.

668
01:12:21,154 --> 01:12:21,694
So thank you.

669
01:12:21,834 --> 01:12:23,474
And thanks to everyone who made it possible.

670
01:12:24,275 --> 01:12:24,675
Thank you.

671
01:12:27,496 --> 01:12:28,976
Yes, our student rep, come on up.

672
01:12:30,637 --> 01:12:31,677
We have somebody online.

673
01:12:37,185 --> 01:12:38,046
Yes, absolutely.

674
01:12:47,658 --> 01:12:48,119
Should be on.

675
01:12:51,307 --> 01:13:07,435
Well, I'd just like to say when it comes to the slide on student engagement, especially when it comes to student voice, in my experience, and Darren can certainly speak to it too, the administration's, MHS administration's

676
01:13:08,135 --> 01:13:12,697
Support for student voice has definitely, discernibly increased over the past year.

677
01:13:12,757 --> 01:13:19,981
It's definitely been a big help as we've tried to flesh out our role on the student advisory committee and how we can work to get kids more involved at school.

678
01:13:20,461 --> 01:13:23,783
That has definitely been, especially thanks to Ms.

679
01:13:23,803 --> 01:13:24,403
Cabral and Ms.

680
01:13:24,423 --> 01:13:29,426
Freitas-Haley, who have worked closely with us to try to get, implement very meaningful changes.

681
01:13:29,446 --> 01:13:31,907
Thank you.

682
01:13:31,927 --> 01:13:37,710
And just sort of to add off of what Noah said, sorry.

683
01:13:38,567 --> 01:13:39,968
When starting with core values.

684
01:13:40,649 --> 01:13:54,922
I believe these core values really represent Medford High School as a whole, and just speaking with students and being out in the general student body and I think we've noticed a general positive trends at the high school with student involvement, as well as a student.

685
01:13:56,897 --> 01:14:00,618
students' well-being and their kind of like will to be in the schools.

686
01:14:01,399 --> 01:14:02,479
We've worked carefully with Ms.

687
01:14:02,519 --> 01:14:13,783
Cabral on numerous occasions for some of the events that she mentioned, such as like the pep rally or student risk staff basketball games or other games, as well as on policy making as well.

688
01:14:13,903 --> 01:14:23,286
She has really stepped up and allowed us to give her input when it comes to important things that affect students, such as the homework policy, as well as other policies that we are currently working with her.

689
01:14:28,336 --> 01:14:28,716
Thank you.

690
01:14:29,056 --> 01:14:32,238
You two are involved in everything, just like some of our students that stood up.

691
01:14:32,318 --> 01:14:34,119
So we appreciate all your involvement.

692
01:14:35,699 --> 01:14:37,520
And we do have somebody, one person on.

693
01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:40,582
Chris, if you could just name your name and address for the record, please.

694
01:14:40,602 --> 01:14:42,603
I'm gonna unmute you right now.

695
01:14:42,623 --> 01:14:50,866
Hello?

696
01:14:52,067 --> 01:14:53,207
Yes, name and address for the record.

697
01:14:53,227 --> 01:14:56,569
My name is Christine Bennett.

698
01:14:57,927 --> 01:14:59,487
from 19 Martin Street in Medford.

699
01:15:00,268 --> 01:15:01,608
I just had one quick question.

700
01:15:01,748 --> 01:15:05,009
I'm hearing about this program that will begin at Metro High that we're aiming for.

701
01:15:05,689 --> 01:15:07,369
Would that be in place of Curtis Tufts?

702
01:15:10,490 --> 01:15:12,431
The one we just took a vote on would not.

703
01:15:12,891 --> 01:15:13,911
Okay, thank you.

704
01:15:13,931 --> 01:15:16,412
You're welcome.

705
01:15:17,332 --> 01:15:18,192
Thank you.

706
01:15:18,472 --> 01:15:21,493
Thank you to both of our principals for being here tonight for the presentation.

707
01:15:21,513 --> 01:15:24,154
If there's no further questions, we'll move on.

708
01:15:30,666 --> 01:15:36,210
I'm going to read number six and seven we have the budget update by Mr Jerry McHugh director of finance.

709
01:15:38,292 --> 01:15:38,772
Number five.

710
01:15:43,690 --> 01:15:54,683
career technical education CTE update Mr. Chad Fallon principal director of medical vocational technical high school and Dr. Peter Cushing assistant superintendent, my apologies.

711
01:15:55,984 --> 01:15:57,145
Can I just interrupt.

712
01:15:58,727 --> 01:16:02,611
Just so that the committee knows why these folks are here.

713
01:16:02,631 --> 01:16:04,513
As we have been planning.

714
01:16:05,915 --> 01:16:22,118
For the MSBA work, one of the things that we have to do because we have such a huge vocational school is fill out some documentation around what programs we have, how big they are, and how big we want them to be as we look forward to a new building of some kind.

715
01:16:22,894 --> 01:16:36,674
And the other thing that this form asks us to do is lay out, if you need programming space for programs that don't exist today, what are those and how much enrollment are you anticipating in these programs that are yet to exist?

716
01:16:37,338 --> 01:16:43,260
And MSBA goes on to describe a set of requirements around what constitutes something they will entertain.

717
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:47,821
So Mr. Fallon and Dr. Cushing have been working hard to articulate that.

718
01:16:48,941 --> 01:16:56,243
My hope is that when they are done, we will take a vote here to direct them to continue to explore these things.

719
01:16:57,587 --> 01:17:13,231
because that will be needed to send to the MSBA with our chapter 70 or viability plan documentation so that they can sort of consider all of this as part of our sort of input to what ultimately will become a feasibility study.

720
01:17:13,251 --> 01:17:15,851
So I will turn it over to Mr. Fallon and Dr. Cushing.

721
01:17:15,871 --> 01:17:18,812
I just wanted to set that sort of groundwork for everybody else.

722
01:17:19,295 --> 01:17:19,615
Thank you.

723
01:17:19,655 --> 01:17:19,855
Yes.

724
01:17:20,435 --> 01:17:22,156
Good evening, Madam Mayor, members of the school committee.

725
01:17:22,216 --> 01:17:40,941
First, I want to thank Mr. Fallon and all the CTE teachers for the amazing work that they do every day, giving our kids real world experiences and the work that Mr. Fallon and staff have done over the last several years to really bolster and expand the programs in an amazing manner up to this point.

726
01:17:41,381 --> 01:17:45,202
So we'll share our presentation and then just jump right in.

727
01:17:48,901 --> 01:17:53,064
So DESE approves Chapter 74 programs.

728
01:17:53,805 --> 01:18:03,331
Right now, Medford High School has 15 of them, and we've seen an increase in demand and enrollment with several programs requiring a wait list.

729
01:18:03,691 --> 01:18:07,374
Mr. Fallon mentioned, how many students are on a wait list right now?

730
01:18:07,854 --> 01:18:08,895
47 students, right?

731
01:18:09,315 --> 01:18:16,240
We are not accepting students from outside of Medford anymore, which I think is really something that the citizens of Medford should know.

732
01:18:18,086 --> 01:18:30,362
More than 50% of MHS students are selecting a CTE pathway and a new master schedule will hopefully align academic and vocational technical opportunities as we move forward.

733
01:18:33,467 --> 01:18:34,428
You wanna talk about survey demand?

734
01:18:37,378 --> 01:18:56,289
So, as part of the documents we have to provide to MSBA, they want to see what our waitlist data looks like for the last three or four years so this just gives a snapshot and I highlighted in bold of the programs that every year we do see students on a list that most likely never make it in because in order to come off a waitlist somebody has to leave and that doesn't typically happen.

735
01:18:56,909 --> 01:19:11,180
So, you know, in our research with looking past in past years and also what industry trends are telling us auto technology cosmetology electrical and health assisting our areas that we would want to seek expansion and in our new building as we reimagine.

736
01:19:13,923 --> 01:19:19,188
This next slide shows some data of students participating in CTE.

737
01:19:19,228 --> 01:19:27,094
So beginning in 21-22, we had just about 195 students in Exploratory, you placed 163, and it had a wait list of 14.

738
01:19:27,514 --> 01:19:41,386
So you can see between 21 and 22 in this current year, the wait list is at or about the same, a little bit less than last year, but there was also other pathways that could have taken this year with the expansion of our arts electives.

739
01:19:41,986 --> 01:19:44,389
So this year we had 72 choose a high school path.

740
01:19:45,510 --> 01:20:01,729
So when we surveyed the Andrews and the McGlynn Middle School, we provided some context in a survey, which was a brief presentation from myself explaining about the survey, and then we provided the programs we currently have, and then we gave them some ideas of programs we're thinking about.

741
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:05,933
Criminal Justice and Protective Services, we had about 83% of the students.

742
01:20:06,293 --> 01:20:09,536
By the way, this was based on 344 student responses.

743
01:20:09,656 --> 01:20:10,577
As of today, though, there was 357.

744
01:20:11,317 --> 01:20:16,061
So I think the little guys and gals are still hacking away at the survey, which is pretty funny.

745
01:20:16,101 --> 01:20:17,362
Wait till you see some of the results.

746
01:20:17,943 --> 01:20:19,324
Who knew they want sewing?

747
01:20:21,215 --> 01:20:23,357
More than five people want sewing, we'll get to that.

748
01:20:24,558 --> 01:20:25,899
We also looked at dental assistance.

749
01:20:25,939 --> 01:20:31,463
This one, we had about half of them that thought that this would be something cool to have a dental assisting program.

750
01:20:31,783 --> 01:20:39,209
We're also looking at things that other vocational schools in the state have had success with, so we're also taking that into consideration.

751
01:20:40,831 --> 01:20:44,313
Criminal justice, we talked about IT and networking.

752
01:20:44,373 --> 01:20:46,635
We had close to 86%, is that 86?

753
01:20:49,167 --> 01:20:49,387
see.

754
01:20:50,689 --> 01:20:59,302
And then plumbers 66.9 was for it plumbing I had less than I thought.

755
01:21:01,738 --> 01:21:05,999
The vet science program yielded about 63% of students thought that that would be cool.

756
01:21:06,079 --> 01:21:12,381
And these are just some of the survey responses when I said, well, is there something that you have in mind that you would like us to think about?

757
01:21:13,021 --> 01:21:14,361
And a lot of these were repetitive.

758
01:21:15,662 --> 01:21:19,262
Meteorology, I thought that was cool, but sewing, that came up a lot.

759
01:21:19,282 --> 01:21:22,483
So it reminded me of kind of that need for that home economics.

760
01:21:23,143 --> 01:21:25,084
So those are some of the survey results we used from that.

761
01:21:28,177 --> 01:21:29,978
So some proposed new programs.

762
01:21:30,859 --> 01:21:36,563
When we're considering proposing new programs for the CT, there are multiple factors to take into consideration.

763
01:21:37,383 --> 01:21:43,367
One is the survey data you just saw, but then we also want to look at what the workforce is telling us, all right?

764
01:21:43,948 --> 01:21:46,970
And what are the types of jobs that are being posted?

765
01:21:47,550 --> 01:21:58,037
And so when we talk about criminal justice to open up, you can see the number of jobs that are there, but there are also jobs that a criminal justice path may lead to, such as being an attorney.

766
01:21:58,897 --> 01:22:15,527
working in the courthouse, anything within the criminal justice realm, but you can see the typical entry level education correlating across the table for security guards, detective and criminal investigators, police officers, EMTs, so on and so forth down through firefighters.

767
01:22:16,387 --> 01:22:31,500
This type of program would not really require much for the school to start up, other than a classroom and perhaps, you know, not perhaps but a specific dedicated teacher to work with students in this, whereas dental assisting.

768
01:22:33,058 --> 01:22:44,885
Um, for demand looks at 525 unique job opportunities within our catchment area on 70 with 70% of those for dental assistance, right?

769
01:22:44,925 --> 01:22:51,769
And you can see in our catchment area where those jobs have posted in relation to Medford.

770
01:22:55,623 --> 01:22:57,786
IT networking, a unique 1,482 jobs.

771
01:22:57,966 --> 01:23:03,394
All right, computer user support specialist for 1,389 and network, computer network support specialist for 93.

772
01:23:10,964 --> 01:23:16,527
plumbing and HVAC, a total of 191 unique job postings for plumbers, pipefitters, and seamfitters.

773
01:23:17,067 --> 01:23:29,955
This data definitely surprised Mr. Fallon and myself because plumbing has been one of those shops, when you look at Medford High School right now, where we have CCL, electrical, automotive, carpentry, this is a more traditional

774
01:23:30,935 --> 01:23:41,163
CTE path shop that we thought would have more interest and more support, but we definitely think it is still something for the committee and for Medford to consider as we move forward.

775
01:23:44,344 --> 01:23:55,712
And veterinary science, a total of 266 unique job openings for veterinary technologists and technicians and veterinary assistants, laboratory animals, caretakers with 73% of that category.

776
01:23:56,213 --> 01:24:03,578
This is the type of track that could lead students to becoming not only vet techs, vet assistants, but being veterinary doctors themselves.

777
01:24:08,361 --> 01:24:12,725
Peter and I like to joke with Maurice that there'll be cows and horses running around the new Medford campus

778
01:24:14,537 --> 01:24:15,258
that tech program.

779
01:24:16,859 --> 01:24:30,271
So when we talk about the four programs we're thinking about expanding, this doesn't mean that we couldn't seek to expand before the new building is in place, but just to give the committee a breakdown, we're looking at seven years of student waitlist data.

780
01:24:30,311 --> 01:24:34,094
We know that there's demand, but there's also costs associated with this.

781
01:24:34,154 --> 01:24:41,720
So as you saw in your packet, we've labeled kind of estimated as best we could, which it comes down to additional teaching staff and some equipment.

782
01:24:42,461 --> 01:24:54,730
You know, you're looking at an investment of just under 400,000 to expand these programs, whether it be now, or within the new building, but if we take build out and furnishings and the cost of a structure out of it.

783
01:24:55,511 --> 01:24:59,153
This is what we're looking at to expand the current program so the idea tonight was to provide you.

784
01:25:00,737 --> 01:25:03,301
information about the new programs and then the jobs that we're expanding.

785
01:25:03,882 --> 01:25:08,610
The last two slides really just show about the auto tech and cosmetology expansion.

786
01:25:08,630 --> 01:25:10,413
There certainly are jobs in the community.

787
01:25:10,894 --> 01:25:14,080
So this would not be something that was a wasted endeavor.

788
01:25:15,862 --> 01:25:35,131
The last thing to mention is that based on the greater Boston regional blueprint, by the way, all the data that we shared tonight came from the mass hire, which their job is really to scout the area and find out where the highest demand is and then they work with people to help them get jobs or get into job programs, even though healthcare and professional and technical services won't listed weren't listed in one of the

789
01:25:36,071 --> 01:25:39,994
reports, it's important to note that they're still listed as critical to the region.

790
01:25:40,014 --> 01:25:43,776
So we may not have posted about culinary jobs, but it's still something that's very needed.

791
01:25:43,816 --> 01:25:59,587
So I thought it was important to mention tonight that although certain things aren't mentioned in the regional blueprint, which by the way is out of date, it's from 2018, and there's a supplemental piece from 2020, we should just be thinking as we look for new programs, what things are critical to the region, and that's hospitality, construction, finance, et cetera.

792
01:26:01,248 --> 01:26:02,269
Any questions at this point?

793
01:26:05,598 --> 01:26:06,099
Member Graham.

794
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:07,320
Thank you.

795
01:26:08,202 --> 01:26:18,736
Um, in terms of the expansion of auto tech cosmetology, electrical and health assisting, can those expansions happen in the current space?

796
01:26:18,856 --> 01:26:20,298
Or are you space constrained?

797
01:26:20,970 --> 01:26:34,565
Yes, auto tech would require a third teacher cosmetology would require a third teacher and electrical would be another teacher elect electrical, we would need more space, health assisting you could do with a third teacher.

798
01:26:34,726 --> 01:26:36,688
So, at this point it comes down to teaching stuff.

799
01:26:41,750 --> 01:26:45,153
None of those are currently budgeted for FY25, is that correct?

800
01:26:45,513 --> 01:26:51,697
We've had an auto tech position, but for the past two years, we remove it for many reasons.

801
01:26:52,138 --> 01:26:58,062
We can function without three right now, so we usually end up foregoing that position, but it's been talked about for sure.

802
01:27:00,223 --> 01:27:01,064
Okay.

803
01:27:01,785 --> 01:27:17,382
In terms of the expansion of those programs, I would love to see a report at some point early next year about sort of a proposal from you all to implement those expansions like over the course of the next

804
01:27:18,129 --> 01:27:20,591
number of years where space is not a constraint.

805
01:27:20,631 --> 01:27:28,778
So obviously electrical would be a sort of a separate issue, but for the three shops where we could expand, what would you recommend that timeline be?

806
01:27:28,958 --> 01:27:30,519
And do they all go at the same time?

807
01:27:30,559 --> 01:27:31,940
Does one come first or second?

808
01:27:32,701 --> 01:27:47,073
But I would like to see that, you know, it does not have to be now, it does not have to be before the end of the year, but as we think about like next fall, really having you come to us with a sort of a proposal of like what we should be planning for and expecting in the coming years, if that's possible.

809
01:27:47,625 --> 01:27:48,486
very much so, yes.

810
01:27:48,566 --> 01:27:49,707
Okay.

811
01:27:49,787 --> 01:28:03,539
And then I'm gonna make a motion that the school committee request that the MSBA explore the program expansions and new programs outlined in this presentation as part of the feasibility study.

812
01:28:04,820 --> 01:28:05,100
Second.

813
01:28:05,140 --> 01:28:05,800
Did you get all of that?

814
01:28:11,786 --> 01:28:12,106
What's that?

815
01:28:12,674 --> 01:28:18,838
the MSBA explore all the expansion requests in this proposal.

816
01:28:20,819 --> 01:28:23,661
Motion by Member Graham, seconded by Member Reinfeld.

817
01:28:23,761 --> 01:28:24,481
All those in favor?

818
01:28:24,501 --> 01:28:25,181
Aye.

819
01:28:26,342 --> 01:28:27,243
Actually, can we roll call?

820
01:28:27,723 --> 01:28:32,866
Roll call, please.

821
01:28:32,966 --> 01:28:33,787
Sorry, quick question.

822
01:28:34,307 --> 01:28:37,048
Member Graham, do you mean MSBA or school building committee?

823
01:28:38,189 --> 01:28:41,111
Sorry, school building committee to feed the MSBA.

824
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:42,240
application.

825
01:28:42,541 --> 01:28:42,821
Thank you.

826
01:28:43,822 --> 01:28:45,704
MSK school school building committee.

827
01:28:46,004 --> 01:28:46,905
Thank you.

828
01:28:47,606 --> 01:28:48,207
Number Brantley.

829
01:28:48,367 --> 01:28:48,587
Yes.

830
01:28:49,588 --> 01:28:50,009
Remember Graham.

831
01:28:50,169 --> 01:28:50,389
Yes.

832
01:28:50,950 --> 01:28:51,610
Remember on top.

833
01:28:51,710 --> 01:28:51,971
Yes.

834
01:28:52,491 --> 01:28:53,212
Remember all about it.

835
01:28:53,292 --> 01:28:53,572
Yes.

836
01:28:54,233 --> 01:28:55,014
Remember rental.

837
01:28:55,134 --> 01:28:55,334
Yes.

838
01:28:55,915 --> 01:28:56,175
Remember.

839
01:28:56,275 --> 01:28:57,216
So yes, Marilyn go.

840
01:28:57,496 --> 01:28:59,979
Yes, seven affirmative zero negative motion passes.

841
01:29:01,661 --> 01:29:02,982
Were you finished with your presentation?

842
01:29:03,002 --> 01:29:03,383
Thank you.

843
01:29:03,403 --> 01:29:03,843
Great job.

844
01:29:04,143 --> 01:29:04,424
Thank you.

845
01:29:15,171 --> 01:29:24,337
We have budget update Mr. Jerry McHugh finance director estimated start time right on schedule 50 seconds, I don't know if we should wait.

846
01:29:24,997 --> 01:29:28,600
And then right after that we'll have our budget vote of the Medford school committee.

847
01:29:28,620 --> 01:29:39,387
And for disclosure my sister is back to Medford be she is a teacher at the McGlynn, so I'm going to abstain from the vote, and I'm going to ask member Graham to come up and share the meeting, please.

848
01:29:43,507 --> 01:29:51,371
Are we going to need a break in the middle do we need to take our, like, two minute break now or if you want a motion to recess for five minutes, that's fine.

849
01:29:52,492 --> 01:29:58,095
I think motion to recess for five minutes by member Ryan tells by member Bramley all those in favor.

850
01:29:58,775 --> 01:29:59,535
I was opposed.

851
01:29:59,735 --> 01:30:00,736
We are in recess until 635.

852
01:38:39,698 --> 01:38:42,401
So just so that everyone knows, thank you all for being here.

853
01:38:42,421 --> 01:38:46,464
I know it's very hot in here and that's not on purpose, I promise.

854
01:38:47,465 --> 01:38:50,627
But I'm afraid to consider opening the windows because I don't think that'll work.

855
01:38:51,047 --> 01:38:54,470
So hopefully we can just bear with the heat.

856
01:38:55,631 --> 01:38:59,634
Item number six is a budget update from Mr. Jerry McHugh, our Director of Finance.

857
01:39:00,175 --> 01:39:02,096
He's gonna provide his presentation.

858
01:39:02,116 --> 01:39:05,179
I'm gonna let the committee ask some questions.

859
01:39:06,099 --> 01:39:15,150
And get their questions answered and then we will be happy to take public comment from all of you I assume many of you are here to speak, just to set your expectations.

860
01:39:15,531 --> 01:39:22,339
We do ask that folks speaking at public comment limit their comments to three minutes and one time.

861
01:39:22,959 --> 01:39:24,762
So please bear with us.

862
01:39:26,773 --> 01:39:37,561
Please feel free to speak from the heart or whatever it is that you need to speak from, but also just remember to do it briefly so that we can all have a chance to speak.

863
01:39:38,242 --> 01:39:45,687
So, Mr. McHugh, it's all yours.

864
01:39:45,907 --> 01:39:46,468
Good evening.

865
01:39:47,108 --> 01:39:51,692
Tonight, I wanted to just give a brief follow up.

866
01:39:51,772 --> 01:39:52,592
We had a lot of

867
01:39:54,497 --> 01:39:56,939
comments and suggestions at the public hearing.

868
01:39:59,982 --> 01:40:04,326
Some of those comments I'd like to address tonight.

869
01:40:05,247 --> 01:40:10,331
And of course at the end, we'll have time to answer any other questions that you might have.

870
01:40:12,634 --> 01:40:14,936
So just to recap,

871
01:40:16,243 --> 01:40:21,567
We did have, this is an extremely difficult budget.

872
01:40:22,768 --> 01:40:29,092
And at the public hearing, we talked about just a lot of needs to get this.

873
01:40:29,232 --> 01:40:42,681
I like to use the metaphor of a house where we wanna do some renovations, we'd like to add on, create a family room,

874
01:40:44,022 --> 01:40:48,603
this is a year that we have to fix the foundation because the foundation is cracking.

875
01:40:49,104 --> 01:40:52,185
We don't want it to crumble for the future.

876
01:40:53,265 --> 01:41:06,589
So we did propose reductions in our administrative assistant ranks and our administrators to try to gain some efficiencies in administration to achieve some budget savings.

877
01:41:07,149 --> 01:41:08,149
We have had three,

878
01:41:10,518 --> 01:41:14,316
Administrative assistance take advantage of early retirement incentive.

879
01:41:15,532 --> 01:41:26,858
and we'll be working with their union representatives to see how we can best meet the needs of the membership with these reductions.

880
01:41:27,558 --> 01:41:32,221
We also looked at class size and looked at scheduling.

881
01:41:34,001 --> 01:41:43,126
We had to propose a net reduction of five teachers at the elementary level, one at the middle grades, and six at the high school.

882
01:41:46,843 --> 01:42:07,863
And then there was this notion brought up at the, at the public hearing that, you know, what's going on with performing arts, you know, we've, I've been on email chains and several members of the community are very concerned about, you know, we're trying to eliminate the band or the,

883
01:42:08,871 --> 01:42:12,895
The Color Guard, are we eliminating drama programs?

884
01:42:13,555 --> 01:42:21,102
One email suggested that we were trying to eliminate all the performing arts programs, and that certainly is not the case.

885
01:42:21,823 --> 01:42:30,431
The budget does provide for over $1.7 million for performing arts and fine arts programs.

886
01:42:33,018 --> 01:42:40,044
What we did propose was to return the management of that program to one coordinator.

887
01:42:41,105 --> 01:42:49,671
It had recently expanded to two coordinators, but in light of our budget situation, we brought that back to one.

888
01:42:49,812 --> 01:42:56,217
And then we did discuss this theater teacher position that had, you know,

889
01:42:58,334 --> 01:43:14,684
resignation, actually, there were two teachers in this position over the course of the year, and the students weren't really selecting the courses that that position was teaching.

890
01:43:16,985 --> 01:43:17,986
So that's it.

891
01:43:18,166 --> 01:43:23,269
Everything else in this program is funded, and that includes

892
01:43:24,864 --> 01:43:31,492
The marching band stipends, the guard stipends, drama programs are fully funded.

893
01:43:33,194 --> 01:43:41,104
We will seek to offer certain theater sections within the teaching assignment of an existing teacher.

894
01:43:42,967 --> 01:43:45,050
that would better align with student interests.

895
01:43:45,791 --> 01:43:59,670
And you could see with the exception of the theater teacher, all the current teachers funded in the performing and visual arts programs are funded in FY25.

896
01:44:05,612 --> 01:44:12,740
The other another concern was with the health services program, you know, how did we come up with these recommended cuts.

897
01:44:15,363 --> 01:44:21,110
We looked at the Massachusetts Department of Public Health recommended.

898
01:44:23,547 --> 01:44:28,470
teaches nurses per student, which is between 250 and 500 students.

899
01:44:29,610 --> 01:44:44,478
The National School Nurses Association recommends one nurse for every 750 students, but we're really focused on the Mass Department of Public Health for our criteria.

900
01:44:48,092 --> 01:44:52,215
So currently, we have 15.6 teachers.

901
01:44:53,016 --> 01:44:58,400
I went back and I looked at the FY 2019-2020 budget, which was the budget before COVID.

902
01:45:06,457 --> 01:45:13,603
At that point in time, we had 12.6 nurses for roughly the same total enrollment.

903
01:45:14,884 --> 01:45:22,590
Of course, it makes complete sense that we wanted to expand these ranks during COVID and return to school protocols.

904
01:45:24,431 --> 01:45:27,333
But you can see that we are,

905
01:45:29,187 --> 01:45:35,134
in decent shape in terms of per-student staffing in FY24.

906
01:45:35,835 --> 01:45:40,079
And across the board, we have one nurse for every 268 students.

907
01:45:40,099 --> 01:45:44,564
So in FY25, with the reductions that we proposed, in FY25,

908
01:45:50,717 --> 01:45:58,165
We still achieve a cross-board staffing of 361 nurses per student.

909
01:45:59,806 --> 01:46:01,067
We will have a staff of 11.6.

910
01:46:05,131 --> 01:46:11,938
Myself, I'm a little bit concerned about the Brooks that's on the high end, but I believe that the,

911
01:46:14,246 --> 01:46:21,149
the incoming director can recommend staffing adjustments to kind of even that out.

912
01:46:22,189 --> 01:46:26,651
But that's essentially how we arrived at those reductions.

913
01:46:28,812 --> 01:46:33,694
And the next area was guidance counselors.

914
01:46:34,134 --> 01:46:41,657
Very similar to the nurses, we looked at recommended staffing levels,

915
01:46:45,144 --> 01:46:49,150
250 students per guidance counselor is recommended.

916
01:46:51,072 --> 01:47:13,865
DESE published a study in 2019 to take a look at how we were doing against those averages, and on average in Massachusetts, there were 404 students per guidance counselor, and then the national average was between 600 and almost 800 for middle school, and then 200 to 243 for high school.

917
01:47:18,021 --> 01:47:36,253
So in FY24, we had two counselors at each of the middle schools and then we had, slide please, and then we had six counselors at the high school.

918
01:47:38,014 --> 01:47:44,859
So we had a very, our staffing was even,

919
01:47:46,687 --> 01:47:48,327
better than the recommended average.

920
01:47:51,668 --> 01:48:03,352
And then in FY25, with those reductions, we will have a higher average at the two middle schools, and we kind of maintain our staffing level at the high school.

921
01:48:04,764 --> 01:48:13,952
So even with those reductions, there's on average is one guidance counselor per 258 students.

922
01:48:20,313 --> 01:48:36,307
And then kind of another comment was, you know, are we, these nurses and guidance counselors are important in social emotional learning programs.

923
01:48:36,587 --> 01:48:46,515
And that is absolutely true, but we have a number of other staff that support students' social emotional wellbeing.

924
01:48:46,595 --> 01:48:48,116
We have adjustment counselors,

925
01:48:50,528 --> 01:48:57,232
BCBAs and Nexus specialists and those all are fully funded in FY25.

926
01:48:58,713 --> 01:49:07,158
And just to take a look at the staffing loads for the adjustment counselors, you'll see that they are pretty reasonable.

927
01:49:10,399 --> 01:49:13,841
On average, we have 246 students per adjustment counselor.

928
01:49:17,993 --> 01:49:28,406
So we feel pretty good about that staffing and as to address SEL priorities next year.

929
01:49:31,203 --> 01:49:38,009
We did talk about at the public hearing the possibility that our Chapter 70 state aid would increase from $135,000 over FY24 to $470,000.

930
01:49:38,089 --> 01:49:42,153
There was an initiative in the House budget which raised the minimum student aid from $30 per student to $104,000.

931
01:49:55,113 --> 01:50:05,865
The good news is that this $104 per student was included in the Senate Ways and Means budget, and that budget is currently being debated in the Senate.

932
01:50:06,546 --> 01:50:14,635
So while there's no absolute guarantee that we'll get that money until the governor signs the budget, it is

933
01:50:16,895 --> 01:50:21,299
very good news that both the House and the Senate are recommending the same number.

934
01:50:21,339 --> 01:50:27,525
So when they go to conference committee to work out the differences, there will be no difference in this line item.

935
01:50:31,549 --> 01:50:38,336
So just to kind of recap where we left off, our current budget is $71.2 million.

936
01:50:42,250 --> 01:50:45,292
We went through and we talked about the need.

937
01:50:45,372 --> 01:50:54,557
We have collective bargaining agreements and other school staff that are in line for salary increases.

938
01:50:54,637 --> 01:51:02,021
Some of these collective bargaining agreements are already agreed to, so they're binding obligation of the school department.

939
01:51:03,702 --> 01:51:09,245
Approximately $4 million of this $8.2 million budget increase is

940
01:51:10,385 --> 01:51:12,446
strictly to salary increases.

941
01:51:14,006 --> 01:51:37,334
And then we identified three other areas that make up the other half of that increase, which include a number of accounts that have been historically underfunded, a number of positions that are currently funded on ESSA that really need to be in the general fund next year because they represent core programming.

942
01:51:39,269 --> 01:51:53,918
And then some new spending initiatives, special ed tuition is going up, a Chromebook and tablet refresh was $477,000 and other increases as well.

943
01:52:00,407 --> 01:52:05,314
which would mean that we would need a budget of $79.4 million to meet all those needs.

944
01:52:05,334 --> 01:52:06,175
We felt like that was

945
01:52:14,666 --> 01:52:18,569
unrealistic ask to make to the city.

946
01:52:19,589 --> 01:52:31,396
And we developed a plan to identify savings, which got our budget, which totaled just under $2.3 million.

947
01:52:31,757 --> 01:52:37,360
And we identified some new funding.

948
01:52:38,621 --> 01:52:41,703
We have an initiative that we would

949
01:52:43,652 --> 01:52:55,815
charge back programs that charge fees in our school system to recoup some administrative and facilities costs involved in supporting those programs.

950
01:52:56,595 --> 01:53:05,578
We identified $200,000 in revolving funds in addition to what's already being charged to revolving funds to

951
01:53:07,199 --> 01:53:12,704
to also supplement the budget and came in at the public hearing with a budget of $76,684,000.

952
01:53:12,844 --> 01:53:25,715
So I'm happy to answer any questions about this presentation or anything else that you might wanna talk about from the public hearing.

953
01:53:38,766 --> 01:53:39,647
questions from the committee.

954
01:53:39,667 --> 01:53:41,968
Member Rousseau.

955
01:53:43,289 --> 01:53:43,709
Thank you.

956
01:53:43,729 --> 01:53:46,610
I greatly appreciate the presentation.

957
01:53:47,251 --> 01:53:49,392
The additional clarity is always welcome.

958
01:53:50,152 --> 01:53:58,657
As I said in the last meeting, I am deeply grateful that you have removed some of the

959
01:54:02,099 --> 01:54:10,341
removed the veil of solvency that we have lived with in Medford for a generation or more.

960
01:54:11,741 --> 01:54:25,264
When we have an expense of $2 million, we have a line item of $200,000 to pay for it, and we pay the $2 million, it is reasonable for the public to conclude that we didn't need that money.

961
01:54:25,624 --> 01:54:30,645
But we got that other $1.8 million by scraping it out of this leftover grant for,

962
01:54:31,963 --> 01:54:51,481
know, reading or whatever we you know we scraped it up from all of these other places, and so that when you look at our budget, you think we spent $200,000 on an item that actually costs $2 million, and that is the opposite of transparency in any and every sense of the word no matter what you think transparency means.

963
01:54:52,051 --> 01:54:55,995
And believe me, everyone in this room has a different definition of transparency.

964
01:54:56,476 --> 01:55:05,224
We all do agree probably that if something costs $2 million, we will tell you it costs $2 million, and we'll put a $2 million item in the budget to pay for it.

965
01:55:06,025 --> 01:55:13,533
And that has not existed in Medford public schools for as long as I've been here for seven and a half years and my understanding is for long before that.

966
01:55:15,130 --> 01:55:22,538
And it's an incredible disservice to the community to continue thinking that something that costs $2 million is only going to cost us $200,000.

967
01:55:22,818 --> 01:55:29,765
And that is the, you know, as horrible as this budget is that is.

968
01:55:32,506 --> 01:55:45,713
frankly, I can never thank you enough for that, because it is something for my seven and a half years I have been asking for, and it has not been something that I've been able to get.

969
01:55:46,854 --> 01:55:58,720
So in light of that, and in light of the fact, you did say one other thing that, you mentioned whether it was a reasonable request, the $79 million, and we can,

970
01:56:03,085 --> 01:56:04,485
Your job is your job.

971
01:56:05,226 --> 01:56:10,727
But in my opinion, the request is the school committee's request and we sort of decide what's reasonable.

972
01:56:12,027 --> 01:56:20,789
And, you know, in light of that, I'm going to make a motion that the Medford school committee budget request in the amount of $79,399,774 for the responsible operations of the Metro public schools.

973
01:56:26,311 --> 01:56:34,063
In 2024 2025 be submitted in writing to the member city council and the mayor of Medford within 48 hours of this motion.

974
01:56:40,489 --> 01:56:50,897
Thank you, Mr so before we continue talking about Mr so his motion is on the floor if there is a second it can stay on the floor.

975
01:56:51,537 --> 01:56:52,438
Second, thank you.

976
01:56:53,419 --> 01:56:57,602
But we're not going to take a vote on that until we have heard the questions of the rest of the committee.

977
01:56:57,622 --> 01:57:00,884
And we have heard from all of you so.

978
01:57:02,185 --> 01:57:07,532
Everyone can just take a breath, exhale, we're going to get to all of you before we get to any sort of voting.

979
01:57:08,533 --> 01:57:14,100
Mr so can you please sort of explain those numbers one more time just so that everybody understands what you just said.

980
01:57:14,915 --> 01:57:18,297
Certainly, so I'll read the language and then explain it.

981
01:57:19,618 --> 01:57:21,420
Zoom keeps coming in and out for me.

982
01:57:22,040 --> 01:57:39,632
The Medford School Committee budget request in the amount of $79,399,774 for the responsible operations of the Medford Public Schools in 2024-2025 be submitted in writing to the Medford City Council and the Mayor of Medford within 48 hours of this motion.

983
01:57:39,813 --> 01:57:44,256
So that is the number that was calculated and displayed at the last meeting.

984
01:57:44,736 --> 01:57:46,798
It is the number that was on one of these slides.

985
01:57:47,178 --> 01:57:54,785
And I do have a spreadsheet that I've shared with Dr. Cushing, if he could put it up, which actually explains that.

986
01:57:58,067 --> 01:57:58,528
Did you get it?

987
01:58:00,710 --> 01:58:02,231
That's because my Zoom is in and out.

988
01:58:02,351 --> 01:58:03,172
Sorry, one second.

989
01:58:04,933 --> 01:58:08,136
So before we take any vote, we'll make sure that we can look at that spreadsheet.

990
01:58:08,156 --> 01:58:09,377
So take your time, Dr. Cushing.

991
01:58:10,798 --> 01:58:12,780
Are there questions from the rest of the committee?

992
01:58:14,093 --> 01:58:20,240
Member Bradley.

993
01:58:20,260 --> 01:58:21,080
My voice is so loud.

994
01:58:22,662 --> 01:58:25,505
Can we specify the elementary positions by building that are being cut?

995
01:58:27,868 --> 01:58:28,068
Yes.

996
01:58:57,784 --> 01:59:22,980
two at McGlynn Elementary, five at Missituck, one at Roberts, two at McGlynn Elementary, five at Missituck, one at Roberts for total of eight,

997
01:59:26,750 --> 01:59:45,099
We're adding three teachers, one at McLennan Elementary for the newcomers program, and two at the Roberts for special education, one classroom teacher, one inclusion for a net production of five.

998
01:59:53,362 --> 01:59:56,443
I think seeing five at the Missittuck is devastating.

999
01:59:58,323 --> 02:00:04,365
And as someone who has worked at the Brooks, I know that the staff is short, but can I ask why there are no staff at the Brooks being cut?

1000
02:00:06,246 --> 02:00:09,506
Not that I want to see anybody cut, I'm just curious where the discrepancies are.

1001
02:00:09,967 --> 02:00:18,009
Well, it's based on class size, you know, so if the class size at the Missittuck was

1002
02:00:19,227 --> 02:00:21,488
low compared to the other schools.

1003
02:00:22,789 --> 02:00:26,270
With the Brooks, I think there's just a switch.

1004
02:00:27,831 --> 02:00:46,819
My memory is maybe the second grade, which happens to be a low cohort in the elementary, that there was one less teacher needed in the second grade, but there was an additional teacher needed in the third grade, so that was a wash.

1005
02:00:49,409 --> 02:00:50,210
Other question.

1006
02:00:50,230 --> 02:00:52,071
Member Brantley, do you want the exact numbers?

1007
02:00:52,131 --> 02:00:54,152
I have the proposal from last week in front of me.

1008
02:00:54,212 --> 02:00:54,653
I have it too.

1009
02:00:54,813 --> 02:00:55,013
Okay.

1010
02:00:55,113 --> 02:00:56,474
I just wanted to make sure we're on the same page.

1011
02:00:58,575 --> 02:01:07,080
With the reduction of the administrative assistance, are we still suggesting six are being cut even though three are taking the early retirement?

1012
02:01:07,480 --> 02:01:07,641
No.

1013
02:01:09,902 --> 02:01:10,722
So there's only three?

1014
02:01:12,223 --> 02:01:13,684
There's only three now, yeah.

1015
02:01:14,204 --> 02:01:16,366
So only three administrative assistance will be cut?

1016
02:01:17,587 --> 02:01:17,987
Not six?

1017
02:01:19,465 --> 02:01:19,845
Correct.

1018
02:01:20,186 --> 02:01:24,469
Well, the positions, three positions.

1019
02:01:24,509 --> 02:01:25,730
I don't like that word, Jerry.

1020
02:01:25,750 --> 02:01:28,952
We talked about that last week because three positions are three people at the end of the day.

1021
02:01:28,972 --> 02:01:29,353
Yeah.

1022
02:01:30,093 --> 02:01:31,875
Well, three of those positions have retired.

1023
02:01:34,537 --> 02:01:44,985
And then that leaves, there's three other positions that we would want to find, you know, other work for if we can.

1024
02:01:46,187 --> 02:01:49,329
So is the elementary position at the McGlynn being cut?

1025
02:01:51,070 --> 02:01:51,310
Yes.

1026
02:01:55,493 --> 02:01:56,773
I don't understand how a

1027
02:01:58,237 --> 02:02:10,227
building secretary is cut if she was six miles away, would she be cut, I don't, I don't understand how that is equivalent is an equivalent, I really, this one I cannot wrap my brain around.

1028
02:02:10,807 --> 02:02:12,549
I really cannot wrap my brain around this.

1029
02:02:13,249 --> 02:02:16,372
How can you go a whole school without the school secretary.

1030
02:02:17,073 --> 02:02:18,574
I don't understand how this is going to be possible.

1031
02:02:20,675 --> 02:02:26,320
If, if, if someone else is going to do her job so does that mean we're paying the other person double, where are we, where are we saving.

1032
02:02:28,066 --> 02:02:30,087
because someone else is gonna have to do her whole job.

1033
02:02:31,028 --> 02:02:34,450
It's not, well, someone will pick up the slack.

1034
02:02:34,570 --> 02:02:36,271
This is a whole position.

1035
02:02:36,291 --> 02:02:38,933
Has anybody shadowed a school secretary?

1036
02:02:40,414 --> 02:02:42,475
Superintendent, have you shadowed a school secretary?

1037
02:02:43,115 --> 02:02:45,877
Member Brantley, would you like the superintendent to weigh in here?

1038
02:02:45,897 --> 02:02:46,858
Yeah, that would be great.

1039
02:02:46,918 --> 02:02:47,138
Great.

1040
02:02:48,379 --> 02:02:48,699
Thank you.

1041
02:02:50,219 --> 02:02:56,383
We still have an additional flavor position that will be part of the ranks.

1042
02:02:57,243 --> 02:03:04,868
And so that is one of the other positions that we plan on using to support the McGlynn complex.

1043
02:03:04,888 --> 02:03:12,793
So if she's there every day, how are we saving money?

1044
02:03:14,134 --> 02:03:14,834
Does she get paid less?

1045
02:03:14,874 --> 02:03:15,615
Is she not in the union?

1046
02:03:15,975 --> 02:03:16,475
What happens?

1047
02:03:16,775 --> 02:03:17,356
I don't understand.

1048
02:03:17,376 --> 02:03:19,137
I really do not understand.

1049
02:03:19,540 --> 02:03:20,702
I don't understand the question.

1050
02:03:20,722 --> 02:03:22,165
Can you restate that question, please?

1051
02:03:22,185 --> 02:03:27,876
So if we have a floater who needs to be in a building all the time... Yes, but they can have... Saving money.

1052
02:03:31,013 --> 02:03:34,376
That person would be allowed to move to other buildings.

1053
02:03:34,396 --> 02:03:44,204
So case in point, if one of the secretaries were to be absent today, there would be one secretary in the office.

1054
02:03:44,984 --> 02:03:51,149
And then if there was the opportunity to assign a floater there, the floater would be the second person assigned.

1055
02:03:51,970 --> 02:03:53,911
So one of the things that we're

1056
02:03:55,112 --> 02:04:01,515
still working on is having that floater based out of the McGlynn complex.

1057
02:04:02,516 --> 02:04:19,525
And as we prepare to negotiate with the administrative assistant union, in the McGlynn complex, there is also an additional administrative assistant that falls under the special education umbrella.

1058
02:04:20,655 --> 02:04:23,458
but is an administrative assistant.

1059
02:04:24,299 --> 02:04:31,106
And so if needed, that individual could be deployed to support the McGlynn complex.

1060
02:04:32,968 --> 02:04:41,677
Okay, so if you need a floater when someone's absent for one day, why wouldn't we need the position filled for the 180 days?

1061
02:04:52,625 --> 02:04:57,371
I'm sorry, it just that that just seems like such a disservice to the McGlynn elementary community.

1062
02:04:57,391 --> 02:05:11,968
I just, I think that we're really want to see our district thrive, and I feel like we survive every day because I know everybody here is working their butt off.

1063
02:05:12,797 --> 02:05:26,068
And I'm listening, you know, I watched a mom nurse her baby out here who's been at school all day, you know, and, and another one that has her toddler on the floor is the people who are doing other people's jobs all the time is when you work in a school you're pitching in.

1064
02:05:26,629 --> 02:05:28,911
It's not as easy just to close the door and walk away.

1065
02:05:28,931 --> 02:05:30,372
It's not how it works.

1066
02:05:30,712 --> 02:05:32,674
When you walk in that building you are 100 people to 100 different

1067
02:05:35,598 --> 02:05:36,398
different avenues.

1068
02:05:36,819 --> 02:05:42,161
And I really, I think that we're, we're, we're giving the McGlynn elementary, such a huge disservice.

1069
02:05:42,722 --> 02:05:46,604
Great we have a floater, but if Mrs Hardy is absent at the Brooks and she's at the Brooks.

1070
02:05:47,421 --> 02:05:50,164
Then now the McGlynn doesn't have a secretary.

1071
02:05:50,184 --> 02:06:01,777
And why is Mrs. Hardy's position, no offense, Mrs. Hardy, but why is her position for one day so important that she gets covered, but the 180 days of the McGlynn doesn't get covered?

1072
02:06:02,017 --> 02:06:06,462
So if I may, through the chair, I appreciate your feedback, Ms.

1073
02:06:06,502 --> 02:06:07,002
Bradley.

1074
02:06:09,890 --> 02:06:33,726
In situations which have happened this past year as well, when both administrative assistants are not available, we still have a fairly significant administrative assistant pool, and we tapped into administrative assistants that were located at the high school campus.

1075
02:06:34,506 --> 02:06:39,367
And they, too, went down to support schools on an as-needed basis.

1076
02:06:39,908 --> 02:06:45,409
It was not something that was temporary, a permanent fix, but on an as-needed basis.

1077
02:06:45,869 --> 02:06:49,891
So I agree, and I'm not denying and saying that people are not working hard.

1078
02:06:50,351 --> 02:06:59,914
But at the same time, if there is a problem and we need to redeploy an administrative assistant from the high school, which had nearly 20

1079
02:07:01,574 --> 02:07:14,058
individuals located on that one campus, we should be able to deploy them so they can go and support one of the other buildings or another department within the district.

1080
02:07:14,798 --> 02:07:18,059
We are one district, we need to work together as one team.

1081
02:07:18,539 --> 02:07:23,241
This is not an easy situation for anyone involved.

1082
02:07:23,822 --> 02:07:31,958
And I don't want you or anyone in the audience to think that we're not trying to think this through properly.

1083
02:07:34,141 --> 02:07:53,649
spoken with one another, we've looked at the numbers, we had to make some tough decisions, but we, in comparison to districts that are of comparable size, we still have a significantly larger administrative assistant pool than Medford Public Schools.

1084
02:07:53,669 --> 02:07:57,350
Okay, well I guess we remain to be seen.

1085
02:07:58,850 --> 02:08:01,491
Under nursing, four nurses still being cut?

1086
02:08:02,572 --> 02:08:02,732
Yes.

1087
02:08:06,189 --> 02:08:13,413
You know, as a parent whose child needed emergency services at our school, this is such a disservice to every single child.

1088
02:08:13,794 --> 02:08:17,296
And it's such a disservice to these nurses who are working overtime.

1089
02:08:17,856 --> 02:08:24,340
Some in my own family, you know, some from my own family, they helped save my daughter's life one day.

1090
02:08:24,740 --> 02:08:32,725
So to think that we could go four less or we could go one less assistant, it's such a disservice to our school.

1091
02:08:32,825 --> 02:08:34,246
We are barely surviving.

1092
02:08:34,835 --> 02:08:42,199
And this is really devastating, in my opinion, that this is going to happen, that we've got to this point.

1093
02:08:44,761 --> 02:08:47,702
I'm concerned about the Brooks, the staffing there.

1094
02:08:47,822 --> 02:08:52,245
You said, you know, you're concerned about the Brooks with the health services.

1095
02:08:54,356 --> 02:09:03,285
Well, I said that that per student enrollment was higher than the rest of the district.

1096
02:09:03,886 --> 02:09:05,368
So we would want to look at that.

1097
02:09:06,028 --> 02:09:09,432
And, you know, I wish I didn't have to.

1098
02:09:10,762 --> 02:09:12,504
prepare a plan that included cuts.

1099
02:09:12,704 --> 02:09:21,992
I mean, yeah, but it's, it's a lot of difficult choices.

1100
02:09:22,392 --> 02:09:24,654
So we are going to be hiring an incoming director.

1101
02:09:25,074 --> 02:09:26,696
Someone's going to take every Heinz place.

1102
02:09:26,976 --> 02:09:27,196
Yes.

1103
02:09:27,696 --> 02:09:29,218
So that position is going to be filled.

1104
02:09:29,558 --> 02:09:32,401
That's already been posted for how long now?

1105
02:09:33,464 --> 02:09:48,620
The position has been posted since February, when the director, previous director went to the Department of Public Health, and I have one applicant who has applied, and that applicant is.

1106
02:09:49,921 --> 02:09:51,341
part of Metro Public Schools.

1107
02:09:52,002 --> 02:10:07,147
We have an interview scheduled for next week to interview the one candidate who has applied and we will include members of the nursing team who expressed interest at the time of Ms.

1108
02:10:07,167 --> 02:10:08,227
Hines' departure.

1109
02:10:08,888 --> 02:10:19,225
So, the nursing director position still exists, it's part of the administrative unit, and that position will be filled for July 1.

1110
02:10:21,648 --> 02:10:47,049
And the comment that you were making earlier, I just want it to be stated for the record that Medford High School will still have 3.0 nurses, and that the McGlynn Complex will have three nurses at the McGlynn Complex, but the FTE is equal to 2.6 FTE, but it's three individuals assigned to the McGlynn Complex.

1111
02:10:47,649 --> 02:10:52,371
and three also assigned to the Medford High School complex.

1112
02:10:53,371 --> 02:10:54,691
How many are assigned to the high school now?

1113
02:10:55,252 --> 02:10:55,632
Three.

1114
02:10:56,432 --> 02:10:57,152
So that won't change?

1115
02:10:57,732 --> 02:10:58,713
That will not change.

1116
02:10:58,733 --> 02:10:59,373
Okay.

1117
02:11:00,373 --> 02:11:06,715
For guidance, I believe last week we discussed, or two weeks ago, we discussed that they also teach a class.

1118
02:11:08,036 --> 02:11:11,717
So if we're cutting them by half, who's teaching the class?

1119
02:11:14,418 --> 02:11:15,298
The remaining staff.

1120
02:11:21,920 --> 02:11:22,560
Do you want me to repeat that?

1121
02:11:23,721 --> 02:11:31,763
So the guidance counselors at the middle school, I believe last week we talked about, or two weeks ago, I'm sorry, that we talked about that they also teach classes.

1122
02:11:33,144 --> 02:11:38,225
So I'm curious, who's gonna teach those classes now that there's one less person?

1123
02:11:38,885 --> 02:11:43,847
How are we managing them to teach the class plus service the students?

1124
02:11:45,796 --> 02:11:48,959
Well, that's a scheduling issue for the principal.

1125
02:11:49,099 --> 02:11:54,844
And so, you know, there still be one counselor assigned to each school.

1126
02:11:55,685 --> 02:12:00,950
So one counselor, and how many students are at the middle schools?

1127
02:12:01,030 --> 02:12:04,593
Projected for next year, I think it's 440 for the Glenn Middle and 442 for Andrews.

1128
02:12:04,613 --> 02:12:04,833
So in 180 days,

1129
02:12:12,756 --> 02:12:16,438
they are gonna service 440 students plus teach classes.

1130
02:12:18,339 --> 02:12:28,045
And then at the Andrews, one person is gonna take care of 442 students plus teach classes to 442 students?

1131
02:12:29,966 --> 02:12:30,867
I'm just trying to figure out the math.

1132
02:12:30,907 --> 02:12:32,248
I'm not too good at division in my head.

1133
02:12:32,268 --> 02:12:36,070
I'm not suggesting that everything is gonna happen exactly the same next year.

1134
02:12:36,110 --> 02:12:36,951
It's not gonna happen.

1135
02:12:36,971 --> 02:12:37,591
This is what I'm afraid of.

1136
02:12:37,611 --> 02:12:38,552
We're gonna have different staff.

1137
02:12:38,892 --> 02:12:41,073
I'm afraid it's not gonna happen, and this is what scares me.

1138
02:12:41,593 --> 02:12:42,434
This is what scares me.

1139
02:12:43,354 --> 02:12:43,954
Superintendent.

1140
02:12:44,234 --> 02:12:45,075
Yes.

1141
02:12:45,815 --> 02:13:00,462
Member Bradley in addition to the positions that were stated in Mr. McHugh's presentation we do carry 17 FTEs as adjustment counselors, we do have BCBAs,

1142
02:13:00,982 --> 02:13:07,330
We do have nexus specialists we don't even have school psychologists listed.

1143
02:13:07,891 --> 02:13:17,062
So, under the leadership of Stacy Sherman, our director of behavioral health and school counseling, there are approximately 45

1144
02:13:19,885 --> 02:13:26,628
individuals, it could even be as high as 48 right now, that provide counseling supports to students.

1145
02:13:27,129 --> 02:13:34,293
So if it's not in the person of an adjustment counselor, it may be a guidance counselor, it could be a school psychologist.

1146
02:13:35,473 --> 02:13:43,377
We as a district actually have very robust offering in terms of cell supports for our students.

1147
02:13:44,158 --> 02:13:47,019
So I know that there is a cut that was

1148
02:13:49,733 --> 02:13:50,914
slated to take place.

1149
02:13:51,734 --> 02:14:03,261
And if you look really closely at the numbers we truly tried our best to stay away from the teaching core and not impact the teaching core.

1150
02:14:05,122 --> 02:14:07,684
Because the teaching core is the closest to the students.

1151
02:14:08,304 --> 02:14:13,267
So I just want to say for the record that although there is one cut that has been identified.

1152
02:14:15,672 --> 02:14:19,233
we still have the other support services that are in place.

1153
02:14:20,033 --> 02:14:30,315
And through grant writing, we actually still have partnerships with outside agencies that are supporting some of our school programs as well.

1154
02:14:31,195 --> 02:14:32,816
Do adjustment counselors teach classes?

1155
02:14:35,076 --> 02:14:35,476
No, right?

1156
02:14:37,096 --> 02:14:41,037
Okay, and then do you need to have an IEP to see an adjustment counselor?

1157
02:14:48,462 --> 02:14:49,783
Yep.

1158
02:14:49,983 --> 02:14:51,384
Adjustment counselor.

1159
02:14:51,525 --> 02:14:52,465
I think Ms.

1160
02:14:52,525 --> 02:14:55,348
Bowen is saying no, you do not need to have an IEP.

1161
02:14:58,711 --> 02:14:59,832
What about a school psychologist?

1162
02:15:02,214 --> 02:15:03,455
Okay, I'm just asking.

1163
02:15:03,675 --> 02:15:08,379
So the answer, just so that people that are on the phone can understand the questions and answers.

1164
02:15:09,119 --> 02:15:13,723
The question was, do you need to have an IEP to see an adjustment counselor or school psychologist?

1165
02:15:13,763 --> 02:15:14,844
And the answer to both is no.

1166
02:15:15,385 --> 02:15:15,585
Okay.

1167
02:15:18,510 --> 02:15:22,111
For staffing adjustment councils, you said it was reasonable.

1168
02:15:22,131 --> 02:15:27,592
That's a scary word to me that we're just reasonable.

1169
02:15:29,852 --> 02:15:30,672
I think that's it for me.

1170
02:15:30,852 --> 02:15:31,412
Thank you, Jerry.

1171
02:15:31,452 --> 02:15:32,293
I appreciate your help.

1172
02:15:32,773 --> 02:15:33,813
I appreciate these numbers.

1173
02:15:34,193 --> 02:15:34,773
I don't like them.

1174
02:15:35,553 --> 02:15:37,954
I can't help but be cranky about it because it's devastating.

1175
02:15:38,334 --> 02:15:42,194
Like I said before, there's nothing more I want than to see us thrive, not to survive.

1176
02:15:43,675 --> 02:15:45,635
My children are in this district, you know,

1177
02:15:48,002 --> 02:15:48,842
This is our family.

1178
02:15:48,922 --> 02:15:50,723
To me, this is what community is all about.

1179
02:15:51,023 --> 02:15:52,684
We need to fight for these students.

1180
02:15:52,884 --> 02:15:53,904
We need to fight for these teachers.

1181
02:15:53,924 --> 02:16:02,367
We need to fight for these administrators that are in the building that are on the ground every single day, program directors.

1182
02:16:02,547 --> 02:16:04,047
I mean, the whole marching band is here.

1183
02:16:04,787 --> 02:16:06,328
It's not just cutting a position.

1184
02:16:06,368 --> 02:16:07,888
It's cutting the heart of a program.

1185
02:16:09,009 --> 02:16:10,889
I can't agree with that.

1186
02:16:10,909 --> 02:16:13,090
I haven't slept in two weeks.

1187
02:16:19,072 --> 02:16:19,493
Thank you.

1188
02:16:19,973 --> 02:16:20,333
Thank you.

1189
02:16:20,353 --> 02:16:21,734
Thank you, superintendent for your comments.

1190
02:16:21,894 --> 02:16:23,214
I appreciate you answering the questions.

1191
02:16:23,254 --> 02:16:23,594
Thank you.

1192
02:16:25,095 --> 02:16:25,935
Thank you, member Bramley.

1193
02:16:26,076 --> 02:16:26,616
Member Rousseau.

1194
02:16:27,056 --> 02:16:27,436
Thank you.

1195
02:16:27,796 --> 02:16:30,357
I just want to clarify, ask a question.

1196
02:16:30,638 --> 02:16:35,180
So as the finance, technically the finance director right now, right?

1197
02:16:35,280 --> 02:16:35,920
Yes.

1198
02:16:36,300 --> 02:16:37,981
You made none of these decisions, correct?

1199
02:16:38,461 --> 02:16:38,761
Pardon?

1200
02:16:38,901 --> 02:16:40,382
Did you make any of these decisions?

1201
02:16:41,394 --> 02:16:53,954
Well, we, I did as part of a team, you know I came up with some recommendations I mean not, not all the recommendations were accepted, and some, you know, turned out to be non workable but

1202
02:16:55,711 --> 02:17:06,400
The, the first task was, you know, to figure out what, how much does it cost to provide a level service budget to Medford public schools.

1203
02:17:07,140 --> 02:17:08,702
And then from there.

1204
02:17:13,168 --> 02:17:26,925
prevent to present the school committee with a plan, I think, you know, it's very reasonable to to bring up issues where some folks might not think that that plan is working but

1205
02:17:30,808 --> 02:17:40,075
We were a part, it was a group decision, program directors would talk to see if things were workable.

1206
02:17:40,615 --> 02:17:58,729
And again, when you get into those discussions, I mean, nobody, people would prefer to have the exact same staff they had last year because they kind of know what that program is like, but then they, it's up to them to kind of see how they would make it work with less staff.

1207
02:18:00,388 --> 02:18:00,748
Thank you.

1208
02:18:01,369 --> 02:18:05,732
I think that, you know, all of us here have received many emails.

1209
02:18:06,673 --> 02:18:12,138
And some of us here have discussed disliking, well, we all dislike the cuts.

1210
02:18:13,019 --> 02:18:21,346
I think that, you know, if in fact, we do not get more money from the mayor, from the city budget, this is nowhere near enough cuts.

1211
02:18:22,087 --> 02:18:26,291
And even if we got enough to avoid additional cuts,

1212
02:18:27,262 --> 02:18:35,569
any additional, if we decide to keep any position, it is a different position that must be cut, well, equivalent amounts of money.

1213
02:18:35,729 --> 02:18:45,838
So I think it's important to remember that, and that group of people, just to clarify, Mr. McHugh, did not include school committee members, correct?

1214
02:18:46,219 --> 02:18:46,599
Did not.

1215
02:18:46,919 --> 02:18:47,240
That's right.

1216
02:18:47,800 --> 02:18:50,062
I think that's important because, you know, there's,

1217
02:18:51,550 --> 02:18:58,613
not to be defensive, but as the senior member, which Paulette used to do that, I guess it's on me now.

1218
02:18:58,713 --> 02:19:07,536
It's really important to note that we're not in the rooms making these decisions, that we hire the superintendent and it is the superintendent's job to present a budget.

1219
02:19:09,136 --> 02:19:15,419
And we can vehemently disagree and we can vote or not vote for the budget.

1220
02:19:16,239 --> 02:19:17,680
In the last budget hearing,

1221
02:19:19,535 --> 02:19:25,477
I made a statement that in Massachusetts, no school committee has refused to pass a budget.

1222
02:19:25,697 --> 02:19:30,459
So there was no understanding of what happens on July 1 if we refuse.

1223
02:19:31,019 --> 02:19:37,141
In that intervening two weeks, Uxbridge actually did not pass a school budget.

1224
02:19:37,581 --> 02:19:41,502
They are sending out layoff notices to all their staff.

1225
02:19:42,123 --> 02:19:46,404
And the state has said on July 1, they have $0 and will not have a school district.

1226
02:19:48,453 --> 02:19:55,519
So let's really hope for Uxbridge that somebody passes a special law to find a way around this for them.

1227
02:19:56,200 --> 02:19:57,421
I do not envy them.

1228
02:19:57,961 --> 02:20:13,094
But unfortunately, the answer we now have from their disaster they're going through is that if we do not approve any budget on July 1, the Medford Public Schools closes every employee, HR by the way included.

1229
02:20:13,194 --> 02:20:15,636
So if you have a question about your benefits, too bad.

1230
02:20:16,428 --> 02:20:22,393
the superintendent, everybody goes home until we figure out how to pass a budget.

1231
02:20:22,893 --> 02:20:37,004
So we are not in a situation where we can grandstand, and I don't mean that in any way, but sometimes, well, I mean, frankly, all of us grandstand at different times, but we can disagree with this all we want.

1232
02:20:37,144 --> 02:20:42,248
But if we do not pass a budget by July 1, there will be no public school system.

1233
02:20:42,788 --> 02:20:45,110
And that's kind of hard to wrap your head around because you're like,

1234
02:20:46,181 --> 02:20:54,769
It's the law, there has to be one, but the state just clarified in the last two weeks to Uxbridge that no, there actually, you will have zero dollars to spend.

1235
02:20:55,249 --> 02:20:56,410
Nobody will get a paycheck.

1236
02:20:57,031 --> 02:21:00,374
There will be no HR person when you have a change in benefits.

1237
02:21:00,954 --> 02:21:10,363
It's kind of a catastrophic level of anarchy almost that is hard to comprehend, but, you know,

1238
02:21:11,095 --> 02:21:13,276
And I'm sort of glad it's not us that's going through it.

1239
02:21:13,716 --> 02:21:16,557
But, you know, we're going to try and get more money.

1240
02:21:16,737 --> 02:21:23,619
That's what my motion is for, is to do that level service budget, so that we have dramatically fewer layoffs.

1241
02:21:27,241 --> 02:21:34,043
But at the end of the day, if that number is how we are given, we either pass a budget that we dislike immensely,

1242
02:21:35,546 --> 02:21:37,588
or there's no map for public schools on July one.

1243
02:21:37,849 --> 02:21:39,070
Those are the two options.

1244
02:21:40,291 --> 02:21:45,978
And so I have a spreadsheet I shared with Dr. Cushing if he wouldn't mind sharing it.

1245
02:21:48,604 --> 02:22:01,709
And if I can interrupt from the chair, for those of you who may be joining us for the first time, lucky you, because we do this every year and it is five years and counting of being pretty bad.

1246
02:22:02,289 --> 02:22:11,892
So what we have tried to do in the last couple of years is do two things when we are talking about the budget.

1247
02:22:12,072 --> 02:22:14,193
The first is to request

1248
02:22:15,293 --> 02:22:17,835
what we need from the municipal government.

1249
02:22:18,196 --> 02:22:21,799
So that is the motion that Member Rousseau put on the floor.

1250
02:22:23,260 --> 02:22:24,622
Then we need to

1251
02:22:25,612 --> 02:22:34,255
wait patiently or impatiently, as it may be for the mayor to finish her work citywide, and for the council to pass their budget.

1252
02:22:34,415 --> 02:22:43,698
And once those two things happen, the preliminary number that was provided by the mayor under the budget ordinance by the city council was preliminary.

1253
02:22:43,718 --> 02:22:45,579
That means it's not final.

1254
02:22:46,019 --> 02:22:55,102
So we will get a number through a past budget via the mayor and the city council at some point between now and the end of June,

1255
02:22:55,859 --> 02:23:05,304
And at that time, we typically will pass a second request or a second motion that actually spends the money appropriated.

1256
02:23:05,824 --> 02:23:13,467
So what Mr. Russo put on the floor tonight, just for you all to be clear, is our request to the municipal government.

1257
02:23:14,208 --> 02:23:15,969
I don't think it outlines any cuts.

1258
02:23:16,049 --> 02:23:17,710
You said level service, is that correct?

1259
02:23:19,110 --> 02:23:20,091
Correct, level service.

1260
02:23:21,011 --> 02:23:21,091
Okay.

1261
02:23:21,131 --> 02:23:22,172
And it also adds,

1262
02:23:24,308 --> 02:23:33,796
Well, some of these things were things that were savings like for literacy interventionists we don't actually have any right now, even though we had budgeted for them so this adds them back in.

1263
02:23:34,417 --> 02:23:37,559
And then for professional behavioral specialists as well.

1264
02:23:38,851 --> 02:23:39,211
Thank you.

1265
02:23:39,952 --> 02:23:50,717
And you can see that on the screen now so that request will go to the mayor, obviously she's here tonight but that will go to the mayor, it will go to the finance team at the city, it'll be considered by the city council.

1266
02:23:57,165 --> 02:24:05,410
to the city council, they then we all have to let them do their work and wait patiently or impatiently depending on who you are.

1267
02:24:06,071 --> 02:24:12,575
And when they finish their work, they'll come back around to us and say here's your number, and then

1268
02:24:13,135 --> 02:24:18,500
We will be back here if the number is not what we requested it never is.

1269
02:24:19,441 --> 02:24:23,284
And we will talk about like the brass tacks of exactly what happens.

1270
02:24:23,805 --> 02:24:29,810
So that's the process I just want to make sure everybody knows what that is, where we are right now is we're making a request.

1271
02:24:31,131 --> 02:24:39,733
What Jerry has laid out is sort of something in the middle of like what we might request and what is responsive to that preliminary number.

1272
02:24:39,813 --> 02:24:47,994
So I just wanna make sure everybody is clear on that before we take public comment, but there are no other comments from the school committee.

1273
02:24:48,014 --> 02:24:50,715
Member Russo, did you have another comment?

1274
02:24:51,015 --> 02:24:51,475
Oh, I did not.

1275
02:24:51,615 --> 02:24:54,055
I just turned my mic off.

1276
02:24:55,015 --> 02:24:55,636
Member Ntapa.

1277
02:24:56,916 --> 02:24:57,676
Thank you very much.

1278
02:24:58,755 --> 02:25:20,241
I again, want to just say that my comments are more comments than questions, maybe a little bit of both, but wanted to take the opportunity to sort of give my concerns to also let people know that they are heard because a lot of them are from the many, many emails that we have gotten over the last two to three weeks, I believe.

1279
02:25:21,161 --> 02:25:24,262
And I just want to take a moment and apologize to those who I wasn't able to get to.

1280
02:25:24,662 --> 02:25:32,798
immediately right away but really appreciate you reaching out with your personal experience and things that are going on and your concerns.

1281
02:25:34,491 --> 02:25:44,477
Again, some of the things, I'm really concerned about us bouncing back and sort of, not bouncing back, really relying on the staffing recommendations.

1282
02:25:44,677 --> 02:25:50,321
I feel like, you know, May is mental health awareness month and we are in a mental health epidemic in crisis.

1283
02:25:50,941 --> 02:25:57,805
And I'm really, really concerned about the amount of nursing, the health cuts, as well as the guidance counselor cuts.

1284
02:25:57,865 --> 02:25:59,046
I know there are adjustment counselors.

1285
02:25:59,086 --> 02:26:01,888
I know we still have 17 of those in this proposed budget.

1286
02:26:02,248 --> 02:26:02,608
However,

1287
02:26:03,749 --> 02:26:25,304
The ease of access to students are the nurses, those are the people who if you are having a panic attack, you go right to the nurses, I have done that numerous times at the high school, it is someone where if you don't know where to go, that is a safe haven, and I know the high school still has three, but that's just an example of, you know, later on, however, I worry about the ones that you know the one full time I know there's some sharing going on.

1288
02:26:26,104 --> 02:26:46,995
I made the comment at the last meeting and we'll make it again about how one can be a little dangerous, especially when it comes to medication at all levels, you know, you can't be administered education, I mean, you can't be administered medication without a nurse present you can't not give it to yourself, whether you are seven or you are 19 that is just not a possibility.

1289
02:26:49,065 --> 02:26:51,108
And so I wanted to really push back on that.

1290
02:26:52,069 --> 02:26:56,574
You know, I'm, you know, seeing go from six to four but still really concerned about that.

1291
02:26:57,295 --> 02:26:59,498
A lot of my other concerns have already been echoed.

1292
02:27:00,679 --> 02:27:04,984
When it comes to the performing arts I'm really happy to hear that you know there's going to be a stipend position.

1293
02:27:05,905 --> 02:27:13,727
I'm really concerned about a stipend position to fund the marching band and color guard because that is such an intensive program in our education system.

1294
02:27:13,847 --> 02:27:18,568
I was an orchestra kid, so I got to witness firsthand how much, you know, work they put in.

1295
02:27:18,708 --> 02:27:33,431
And I also want to make a comment that I didn't make earlier, but, you know, we made a comment about how many people were repeating and repeatedly standing up with our students, but I want to notice how many of our humanity success stories had a performing arts marching band and color guard garments on.

1296
02:27:51,977 --> 02:28:03,863
It's a lot, it's a lot of work, and I've seen it and I worry that when we start to stipend or we start to do that the work may not be, I don't want to say appealing to someone but it's not enough.

1297
02:28:04,783 --> 02:28:12,126
And oftentimes what that happens is it creates a work environment that is too tiring and then people leave and then we don't want people you know that we've had here for 14 years that

1298
02:28:13,467 --> 02:28:23,017
really love the work, but then can't afford to do the work anymore, so they make that tough decision to leave, and then we can't find someone to replace them because no one wants to do that work for however much money that is.

1299
02:28:24,398 --> 02:28:25,479
So those are some of the big concerns.

1300
02:28:25,499 --> 02:28:30,864
That was a lot of the concerns we had gotten in emails was about the performing arts position directly in the state of that.

1301
02:28:30,904 --> 02:28:32,166
I know there was a lot of misinformation.

1302
02:28:32,206 --> 02:28:33,407
I know there was a lot of talk about

1303
02:28:33,807 --> 02:28:36,488
the performing arts program being slashed or cut entirely.

1304
02:28:37,608 --> 02:28:47,570
But that's one of the main concerns I have as someone who sees that sort of on a day-to-day about, you know, people being underpaid, people wanting to have these ambitions and not being able to fulfill them because of that.

1305
02:28:48,570 --> 02:28:59,673
The performing arts, there's a huge, you know, it was actually said in an email that reminded me of the term social-emotional learning and, you know, how the academic access, again, what we just showed, the academic success that our

1306
02:29:01,073 --> 02:29:02,734
our students have when they are in that.

1307
02:29:04,575 --> 02:29:08,997
So that's sort of where my now new concern is with the stipend positions.

1308
02:29:09,037 --> 02:29:11,879
I appreciate there's money being put there, however, that condition.

1309
02:29:12,900 --> 02:29:14,300
That also translates to the Missituck.

1310
02:29:14,440 --> 02:29:20,704
I was talking to some of my former teachers, which is crazy to think that, you know, seeing them here today.

1311
02:29:20,724 --> 02:29:26,407
I was reminded by one of my teachers that was pregnant when I had them, and they showed me a photo of their 16-year-old son.

1312
02:29:27,187 --> 02:29:46,998
And it made me just really, really think back to the time that I was there, and it was the Missittuc, really concerned at the number of positions that's being cut there, especially, you know, a lot of people had said that the class sizes aren't what are as advertised, that we have a lot of staff members really doing the part of their job description that's other duties is assigned, covering for each other.

1313
02:29:47,018 --> 02:29:51,221
And how many of our, you know, language learning students

1314
02:29:52,021 --> 02:29:57,885
are there and how we are cutting down at a school where we send a lot of people who need maybe extra aid there.

1315
02:29:58,285 --> 02:30:05,609
And so that's a huge concern of mine, and one that I wanted to echo from the thousands of comments and people who are here today to talk about that.

1316
02:30:07,630 --> 02:30:14,274
I feel like there's definitely some more comments that have definitely been reshared, so I won't go through some of that, but I just want to, again, thank everyone who's here today.

1317
02:30:14,913 --> 02:30:17,515
And thank you, Jerry, for, again, being transparent.

1318
02:30:17,575 --> 02:30:22,359
I know this isn't easy to do, and I appreciate being able to look at the numbers and see them.

1319
02:30:23,700 --> 02:30:27,243
But those are sort of some of my high-level concerns, so thank you.

1320
02:30:30,472 --> 02:30:30,932
Thank you.

1321
02:30:31,493 --> 02:30:35,355
Thank you member on top of for summarizing some of those emails because we all got them.

1322
02:30:36,456 --> 02:30:39,938
So, these numbers didn't change since the last meeting.

1323
02:30:41,299 --> 02:30:47,922
So I will also repeat myself from the last meeting, which is to say there are no good solutions here there's only least bad.

1324
02:30:48,903 --> 02:30:53,066
But what I want to know is what are the other options here, we you know we.

1325
02:30:53,866 --> 02:30:54,847
This looks terrible.

1326
02:30:55,467 --> 02:30:58,070
Having no money and shutting down the schools is also terrible.

1327
02:30:58,710 --> 02:31:09,239
What other things were considered what can we, what can we expect here what if this is the best what, what did we not do to make this happen.

1328
02:31:10,220 --> 02:31:23,836
And then, particularly in terms of the extenuating circumstances numbers I think we've done a great job of presenting the big picture and how much money is here, but we got a lot of information about what those on the ground numbers are how many appointments are happening how many.

1329
02:31:25,698 --> 02:31:30,240
IEP is how many particular needs are happening at the Mississauga across health services.

1330
02:31:30,480 --> 02:31:36,982
And I don't see any of that here to understand what makes this the least bad solution.

1331
02:31:37,062 --> 02:31:39,823
So we're going to have to figure out with the money.

1332
02:31:39,843 --> 02:31:44,365
And I know it is the role of the district to do that.

1333
02:31:45,425 --> 02:31:47,306
Jerry, thank you for absorbing these comments.

1334
02:31:47,486 --> 02:31:50,647
You did the numbers, but that's not where

1335
02:31:52,298 --> 02:32:11,389
You took the data that was given, but I feel like I just don't have any of that information about other than hearsay what people have sent me and knowing that this was sat down and said this was the possible course of action, and it wasn't feasible because of this, but this is feasible and I want to know that it really is I need to know.

1336
02:32:11,969 --> 02:32:26,447
that there's a plan, you can say this, this person is going away again I'm going to repeat myself because this is the same presentation, the work isn't going away and so who's going to be doing it right if you're cutting the person who's leading the effort to roll out our new health curriculum.

1337
02:32:27,288 --> 02:32:28,428
Where is that happening now?

1338
02:32:28,568 --> 02:32:30,989
What will this look like in practice?

1339
02:32:31,109 --> 02:32:32,130
Because these are the numbers.

1340
02:32:32,630 --> 02:32:46,674
So I don't know that we have time to get into those nitty gritties, but I would really like to see some information, not just on numbers, but the on the ground numbers, the qualitative reasons that this is the least bad plan.

1341
02:32:50,226 --> 02:32:52,287
I think we have a question from our student reps too.

1342
02:32:52,307 --> 02:32:54,748
So Jerry, do you have an answer?

1343
02:32:54,768 --> 02:32:56,309
I think that's perfectly reasonable.

1344
02:32:56,389 --> 02:33:09,976
And I think the member Graham pointed out that we're still kind of in the middle of a process, but we need to see how much money we'll actually have to spend.

1345
02:33:10,376 --> 02:33:18,581
And then we can put some of that information in terms of plans going forward with some of the

1346
02:33:19,861 --> 02:33:21,582
programs that are affected by cuts.

1347
02:33:26,886 --> 02:33:28,186
Noah and Darren, do you want to speak?

1348
02:33:34,962 --> 02:33:41,844
just responding to something member Reinfeldt said in terms of like other alternatives, other options, sort of like least bad options.

1349
02:33:42,964 --> 02:33:57,448
Me and Darren had heard, I don't know how feasible it is, but the idea of a prop 2.5% override from the city, if in the event the city doesn't grant the full level budget that we would be asking for.

1350
02:33:57,468 --> 02:34:00,288
I'm not sure, again, how feasible it is.

1351
02:34:00,328 --> 02:34:01,929
I'm not a finance guy, but I feel like if,

1352
02:34:02,833 --> 02:34:08,803
It sounds like that's not going to be what's happening, even if we ask for that budget, even if we ask for that money, it doesn't sound like the city is really going to give it.

1353
02:34:09,344 --> 02:34:17,016
So my thought is like, if that doesn't happen, is that a possibility to ask the city to ask the people for more money if we can't get more money from the city?

1354
02:34:18,018 --> 02:34:19,239
Okay, I can take a shot at that.

1355
02:34:19,279 --> 02:34:19,779
How's that sound?

1356
02:34:20,339 --> 02:34:21,119
All right.

1357
02:34:22,280 --> 02:34:30,184
So, so, in order to put forward a proposition two and a half override to the city, the mayor and the council need to agree to that.

1358
02:34:31,364 --> 02:34:41,189
I sit on the city's finance task force and I know that that is very much part of the discussion happening right now so I believe that we will see a request from both the council and the

1359
02:34:42,029 --> 02:34:44,231
to do a proposition two and a half override.

1360
02:34:44,831 --> 02:34:49,594
There is, there are still a lot of questions to be sort of asked and answered.

1361
02:34:49,634 --> 02:34:58,861
We've never even tried this in Medford before in history, we are one of like three communities in the entire state that hasn't even tried so we have a lot of questions.

1362
02:34:59,341 --> 02:35:00,602
We're trying to collect answers.

1363
02:35:01,082 --> 02:35:10,386
And those answers might include or could include if we do a proposition two and a half override, and it passes how quickly can that money flow to the schools.

1364
02:35:11,307 --> 02:35:11,887
That is going to.

1365
02:35:12,347 --> 02:35:22,512
And that's why I say we have to let the mayor and the council do their work, because they have a lot of questions to ask and answer to figure out like what is that path forward.

1366
02:35:22,952 --> 02:35:28,395
There's all kinds of other stuff that goes on in budgeting that the mayor is still working on as she puts her budget out so

1367
02:35:28,955 --> 02:35:41,165
She may find that, you know, for example, local receipts from local receipts were higher than expected and so the revenue forecast can change so there's a lot of variables still happening but I think to answer your question.

1368
02:35:41,605 --> 02:35:53,275
Yes, a proposition to have override is very much on the table and that would allow us and the first time in history to ask the community to tell us how much they value our schools and.

1369
02:35:54,465 --> 02:35:56,726
I've said it a million times I've campaigned three times.

1370
02:35:57,147 --> 02:36:13,515
I'm a supporter, I will knock on your door and I will convince you when we get there but yeah it's a good question and I think that's where what we're going to do tonight is we're going to make a request so that everybody in the city knows what we need to help Medford thrive, not survive.

1371
02:36:14,295 --> 02:36:28,346
What Jerry has presented is like that sort of middle of the road response that includes both like what do we want to thrive, and then what do we think we might actually have at our disposal and how do we sort of close that gap.

1372
02:36:29,867 --> 02:36:42,252
If that number that comes back from the city is something less than what we have asked for, then this committee will have to make the choices about what is funded and what is not so, but to answer your question, absolutely.

1373
02:36:43,452 --> 02:36:47,694
Raising revenue is one way that you balance the scales.

1374
02:36:48,534 --> 02:36:50,195
So, you're right on target.

1375
02:36:51,116 --> 02:36:54,377
It's just not something this group has the authority to do or I would do it tonight.

1376
02:37:01,096 --> 02:37:04,979
There are a lot of things I want to touch on.

1377
02:37:05,760 --> 02:37:07,301
So first, I just want to address the cuts.

1378
02:37:07,321 --> 02:37:17,048
So I was discussing with Noah as well, and we strongly believe that any sort of cuts

1379
02:37:27,990 --> 02:37:42,343
whether directly to teaching staff or to the supporting staff that support the students or the faculty or the administration, will affect the so-called teaching core of students and cause irreversible damage.

1380
02:37:44,367 --> 02:37:57,700
And furthermore, I just had some questions regarding additional proposed spending since we're talking about cuts, yet there seems to be, in my opinion, some questionable spending so I just had some questions regarding that.

1381
02:37:59,361 --> 02:38:11,432
So on page 14 of the presentation, there's proposed 20% of our Apple and Chromebook inventory technologies be refreshed, and that will cost roughly $477,000.

1382
02:38:11,492 --> 02:38:24,364
So just wondering roughly how much of that needs to be immediately replaced versus how much can be delayed until further funding is available.

1383
02:38:25,785 --> 02:38:30,451
So, that represents a 20% of the inventory.

1384
02:38:30,792 --> 02:38:41,686
So, our approach was to have a five year plan to five year cycle to have a complete refresh.

1385
02:38:43,792 --> 02:38:54,550
The problem that we have is that many of these Chromebooks were purchased during COVID and of course that was absolutely necessary because of remote learning.

1386
02:38:56,092 --> 02:38:57,895
So now we are faced with the problem of

1387
02:38:58,908 --> 02:39:02,310
you know, all these Chromebooks are like aging out at the same time.

1388
02:39:03,110 --> 02:39:21,579
So we really, it's gonna be still a couple of rocky years, I think, because the need will be greater in the beginning of the year, but if we can get on 1 5th refresh, I think that will put us on a good path.

1389
02:39:23,300 --> 02:39:30,914
The staff actually wanted something shorter, and I just didn't think that this was a year that we could entertain that.

1390
02:39:33,720 --> 02:39:44,124
Jerry, can I just also say from the chair that when you look at the depreciation life cycle of laptops that are frankly like more powerful and sophisticated than a Chromebook.

1391
02:39:45,105 --> 02:39:49,707
The typical depreciation life cycle is like two or three years in any corporation.

1392
02:39:50,187 --> 02:39:57,510
So when we talk about a five year life cycle we're actually talking about a pretty extended life cycle for our equipment for our students so

1393
02:39:58,010 --> 02:39:59,972
Luckily, Chromebooks have fewer moving parts.

1394
02:40:00,052 --> 02:40:04,195
And so that's a little bit more feasible than in a laptop situation.

1395
02:40:04,575 --> 02:40:08,078
But this depreciation cycle is very long already in today's time.

1396
02:40:09,419 --> 02:40:13,282
And it includes tablets too, which I used in the lower grades.

1397
02:40:17,702 --> 02:40:18,923
And I just had another question.

1398
02:40:19,864 --> 02:40:21,825
Can I just add to that?

1399
02:40:21,925 --> 02:40:36,716
The Chromebooks have a designated lifecycle, not because only of the durability of the device itself, but the license, the Chromebooks are licensed and the license expires at a set date, and they cannot be extended.

1400
02:40:37,457 --> 02:40:45,343
So the Chromebooks not only is it the device, it's the device license that comes with it, that once that terminates, that's it for the Chromebook.

1401
02:40:50,814 --> 02:40:55,275
Thank you.

1402
02:40:55,315 --> 02:40:57,895
And this is another question regarding buses on page 15.

1403
02:40:58,015 --> 02:41:07,477
I just had a question on this proposed that there'd be two additional buses costing roughly $165,000.

1404
02:41:08,398 --> 02:41:19,520
I was just wondering where those buses would be going and based on what sort of studies or data would back up the need for two additional buses?

1405
02:41:20,310 --> 02:41:26,135
Well, that was in speaking with the person in charge of transportation.

1406
02:41:26,155 --> 02:41:34,423
There was a lot of concern in the community about overcrowded buses at the beginning of the school year.

1407
02:41:35,564 --> 02:41:39,968
So two buses would alleviate some of that overcrowding.

1408
02:41:40,228 --> 02:41:43,210
And if that funding was ultimately provided,

1409
02:41:43,891 --> 02:41:58,224
then we would work with the bus company to redesign the routes in order to spread out the riders through an increased number of buses.

1410
02:42:01,559 --> 02:42:15,791
Yes, I just wanted to comment that the Brooks and Roberts schools, both schools which had high ridership on the buses, the elementary buses were really packed.

1411
02:42:16,752 --> 02:42:20,615
And there was a lot of, we were trying to switch routes around.

1412
02:42:21,115 --> 02:42:29,322
So we do need at least two additional buses in order to alleviate overcrowding on those bus routes.

1413
02:42:30,814 --> 02:42:31,216
Thank you.

1414
02:42:33,584 --> 02:42:34,668
Darren did you have more questions.

1415
02:42:34,688 --> 02:42:35,792
Yeah, one more.

1416
02:42:37,890 --> 02:42:45,154
And then my last question is regarding the payrolls as HR new positions, capacity and supervision to FTEs costing roughly $150,000.

1417
02:42:45,314 --> 02:43:00,804
I'm just wondering if there's any possibility that instead of adding those new positions, if those can be kind of rolled into the existing positions that we have and have those positions fill it out based on doing like cross trainings or any other.

1418
02:43:01,925 --> 02:43:06,217
position so that we don't have to add two more while we're cutting the positions.

1419
02:43:11,061 --> 02:43:31,086
I did not like the idea of trying to ask for these two positions at the same time we're making all these cuts, but I felt like I would be given, I would be providing a disservice to the school committee if I didn't identify this particular need.

1420
02:43:31,766 --> 02:43:33,867
There's the,

1421
02:43:35,762 --> 02:43:47,974
There was a maternity leave in payroll this year, which resulted in a 50% cut to the staff, because there's only two payroll people for the entire district.

1422
02:43:49,074 --> 02:43:56,778
Um, they, um, there's a lot of demands with M. T. R. S. Reporting now.

1423
02:43:57,338 --> 02:44:00,940
Um, and that has been behind and we're trying to get that current.

1424
02:44:01,901 --> 02:44:07,224
Um, many employees participate in benefit programs and

1425
02:44:07,884 --> 02:44:21,911
tax deferred programs that require weekly maintenance when when those when changes when employees want to make changes to those programs and

1426
02:44:24,167 --> 02:44:28,591
So somebody has to be there to answer questions and direct the work.

1427
02:44:28,651 --> 02:44:41,302
So my vision for that, the business office is we have two people in accounts payable that could be supervised by the assistant director.

1428
02:44:42,022 --> 02:44:46,106
We have two people in payroll that could be supervised by this new position.

1429
02:44:46,126 --> 02:44:51,471
There's a grants manager and of course the director.

1430
02:44:52,625 --> 02:44:57,689
That to me is kind of a better organization of the office.

1431
02:44:59,791 --> 02:45:05,416
When I worked for Chelsea Public Schools, there was 14 positions in the business office.

1432
02:45:06,717 --> 02:45:10,960
And granted, they get a lot more money in Chapter 70, so they have

1433
02:45:11,992 --> 02:45:19,918
kind of the bandwidth to to provide that staffing and the, the enrollment is is also larger than Medford.

1434
02:45:21,320 --> 02:45:23,541
But it's just, it's too low.

1435
02:45:25,083 --> 02:45:30,907
The same thing with with HR there's three people in HR, including the HR director.

1436
02:45:32,671 --> 02:45:40,157
There's one staff assigned to our absence management application, which has to be maintained.

1437
02:45:40,177 --> 02:45:45,961
It takes up most of that person's time just maintaining that to make sure it's accurate.

1438
02:45:46,482 --> 02:45:47,923
It feeds the payroll system.

1439
02:45:49,084 --> 02:45:53,027
It provides information to school principals about their staffing.

1440
02:45:54,107 --> 02:46:00,492
There's another position that deals with fringe benefits as well within HR.

1441
02:46:04,349 --> 02:46:18,956
The amount of onboarding that has to be done, getting back to individuals who would like to be substitute teachers, the beginning of the year, it's very difficult to keep up with that.

1442
02:46:21,117 --> 02:46:28,120
There's no off-boarding protocol right now that really should be implemented when somebody leaves.

1443
02:46:28,180 --> 02:46:30,621
There's a lot of things that have to be buttoned up.

1444
02:46:32,737 --> 02:46:37,342
So again, it's just too lean.

1445
02:46:38,183 --> 02:46:45,332
There was at one time, I was told that there was additional staff in the payroll and additional staff in HR and then

1446
02:46:46,334 --> 02:46:58,823
over the course of trying to deal with competing needs and not sufficient resources to address those needs that those positions have kind of gone away.

1447
02:46:58,903 --> 02:47:02,826
So I'm recommending that they be restored.

1448
02:47:02,846 --> 02:47:07,529
I just had a question for the chair.

1449
02:47:07,930 --> 02:47:08,370
Sure.

1450
02:47:08,430 --> 02:47:13,634
When would be a good time to introduce like a petition to the school committee?

1451
02:47:14,290 --> 02:47:16,251
You can describe it right now if you want.

1452
02:47:18,951 --> 02:47:21,072
Point of clarification before we move on.

1453
02:47:21,692 --> 02:47:23,173
Can you put your microphone on so we can hear you?

1454
02:47:23,493 --> 02:47:24,433
Point of clarification.

1455
02:47:24,453 --> 02:47:25,373
Yeah.

1456
02:47:25,734 --> 02:47:39,358
I just wanted to not to stir the pot, but in reference to student members' wrongs with the payroll managerial positions, I think there was some also concern from the union about those usually being administrative assistant roles and then them being non-union.

1457
02:47:39,538 --> 02:47:39,918
Is that?

1458
02:47:40,718 --> 02:47:42,841
still a proposed effort?

1459
02:47:42,901 --> 02:47:44,904
I just want to get clarification if that's changed.

1460
02:47:45,565 --> 02:47:55,037
No, we're not trying to take work away from the administrative assistance, but we do believe that the work that the

1461
02:47:56,178 --> 02:48:12,451
administrative assistants have should be supervised and kind of somebody that can lead what work will be done, you know, particularly at the beginning of the school year, at the end of the school year, and then at different times.

1462
02:48:12,551 --> 02:48:16,914
There's just, there's not enough time to get all the work done.

1463
02:48:16,974 --> 02:48:21,678
It's just too much coming in and somebody has to be able to

1464
02:48:22,844 --> 02:48:27,866
Yeah, act as a traffic controller to see what needs to be done immediately and what kind of put off.

1465
02:48:28,866 --> 02:48:29,126
Thank you.

1466
02:48:38,211 --> 02:48:42,453
We've been asking for additional payroll and business staff for years now.

1467
02:48:43,934 --> 02:48:52,518
And we are the ones that hear that we pass a union, we get a ratified union contract and it can take months before people get their check.

1468
02:48:53,258 --> 02:48:58,001
And maybe in 1950, that was 100% reasonable.

1469
02:48:58,761 --> 02:49:03,083
In this day and age, if it's less than a week, something's really, really wrong.

1470
02:49:04,517 --> 02:49:10,907
You type the numbers into a computer system, it does the calculations, but we don't have that in Medford.

1471
02:49:12,369 --> 02:49:15,655
And so, considering how manual it is at the moment,

1472
02:49:17,505 --> 02:49:33,133
We need more staff because so folks should not have to wait weeks or months, get a partial for the retroactive stuff and then another month goes by and they get their longevity from three years ago, and it's like nobody can figure it out if you're especially on the receiving end.

1473
02:49:36,515 --> 02:49:40,018
Last, I believe it was last year, we had a presentation.

1474
02:49:41,819 --> 02:49:54,489
I forget who gave it to us, but we had asked for a, what would it cost for Medford public schools to become modernized computer systems, munis is the is pretty much what everybody buys.

1475
02:49:56,130 --> 02:49:56,991
And it was.

1476
02:49:58,171 --> 02:50:23,199
18 months and like 1.7 million I think if my memory is correct to buy the software to train all of the staff to have the consultants helping all of the staff because you know like the payroll will have to happen the day after we have Munis and with all the training in the world you can't just like walk in and just make it happen so we definitely you know and if we had Munis we might

1477
02:50:23,319 --> 02:50:34,256
We may be able to reasonably have conversations about adding staff, but when I look at other districts, Malden I believe has 20 people in their business office, they're not much bigger than us.

1478
02:50:38,049 --> 02:50:38,449
Is that right?

1479
02:50:39,150 --> 02:50:39,410
Six.

1480
02:50:39,590 --> 02:50:39,871
Six.

1481
02:50:41,572 --> 02:50:42,793
There's not less work here.

1482
02:50:42,813 --> 02:50:45,936
There's more work here because we don't have the systems.

1483
02:50:46,616 --> 02:51:00,808
So I know that choosing between nurses, administrative assistants, administrators, teachers, and the business office is a pretty ugly choice to have to make.

1484
02:51:01,348 --> 02:51:03,891
But when people are,

1485
02:51:04,639 --> 02:51:10,582
become employed here, it'd be nice if they could start getting a paycheck within a reasonable number of weeks of actually being an employee.

1486
02:51:11,143 --> 02:51:16,526
Or when you retire, it'd be nice if you can find out, hey, can I retire now?

1487
02:51:17,066 --> 02:51:23,029
And we can help you instead of by the time you get an answer, you've already decided, well, I guess I'm not retiring this year.

1488
02:51:24,310 --> 02:51:29,453
So it is an ugly choice, but it is one we have been pushing for for several years.

1489
02:51:30,213 --> 02:51:33,435
And I hope we can keep that in the budget because

1490
02:51:34,299 --> 02:51:40,821
In addition to everything I just described, the school committee has asked for reports that are not possible with the staffing levels we have.

1491
02:51:41,321 --> 02:51:45,762
Some of them are possible because of the systems and the software can't just push them out.

1492
02:51:47,862 --> 02:51:51,543
And these reports are not just another report to throw in the recycling bin.

1493
02:51:51,603 --> 02:51:57,264
They're reports to help us guide the district and understand where we want Medford Public Schools to go.

1494
02:51:57,284 --> 02:51:59,245
And without that information,

1495
02:52:00,885 --> 02:52:06,369
You know, it's you're steering without a map and it's just not a good situation.

1496
02:52:06,449 --> 02:52:07,970
So I appreciate that they're in there.

1497
02:52:08,370 --> 02:52:09,551
I hope we can keep them in there.

1498
02:52:09,651 --> 02:52:14,274
But I also just hope we can get the 79 million and stop being all worried.

1499
02:52:14,854 --> 02:52:15,174
Thank you.

1500
02:52:18,096 --> 02:52:20,838
Darren, did you want to tell us about your petition?

1501
02:52:28,109 --> 02:52:47,912
So on behalf of the students of Medford High School, Technical Vocational High School, along with faculty members, with over 200 student signatures and over a dozen faculty member signatures, including the Medford Teachers Association Union President, Mr. Guillen, we'd like to introduce this petition to the school committee.

1502
02:52:50,523 --> 02:53:07,476
The students of Medford Public Schools are formally writing this petition to Madam Mayor, Brianna Lungo Kern, Medford City Council and Medford School Committee to ask that the rainy day fund be utilized to fully reconcile the Medford Public Schools funding deficit for the Medford Public Schools 2024 to 2025 school year.

1503
02:53:08,017 --> 02:53:17,765
We believe this action is not only possible, but necessary to preserve the quality of education and wellbeing of students and faculty attending educational facilities throughout the district.

1504
02:53:18,345 --> 02:53:24,696
We believe that the budget cuts proposed constitutes an immediate emergency to the students of Medford Public Schools.

1505
02:53:25,916 --> 02:53:30,678
The stakeholders petitioning the city acknowledge that the city of Medford is presently experiencing a budget deficit.

1506
02:53:31,139 --> 02:53:46,106
If approved, however, the school committee's proposed cuts of 2024-2025 budget will have a detrimental effect on the quality of education and wellbeing of students and faculty, and may further drive away families from considering enrollment in our city's public schools.

1507
02:53:46,826 --> 02:53:53,510
In particular, cuts proposed to the numerous school nurse positions, administrative assistants, guidance counselors, teachers,

1508
02:53:54,110 --> 02:54:02,678
coordinator of music, et cetera, put Medford public school students at an educational, emotional, and social disadvantage compared to the surrounding public and private schools.

1509
02:54:03,359 --> 02:54:12,268
While surrounding school districts will be investing more resources to improve quality of education and address student wellbeing, Medford will be stripping away the already limited systems in place.

1510
02:54:13,675 --> 02:54:25,383
If the aforementioned positions are cut, student athletic enrollment, arts involvement, academic self-efficacy, and the ability to seek medical examination will be severely reduced and slash or delayed.

1511
02:54:25,843 --> 02:54:28,765
Students with medical conditions may not be able to receive treatment.

1512
02:54:29,065 --> 02:54:34,769
within an adequate time frame, engage in extracurricular activities, or enjoy field trips due to shortage of staffing.

1513
02:54:35,229 --> 02:54:44,736
Necessary forms and paperwork will take significantly longer to process, and students will meet with their guidance counselors less frequently and may miss many educational opportunities.

1514
02:54:45,236 --> 02:54:53,562
Furthermore, teachers will have larger class sizes, putting more strain on our already overburdened faculty, irrevocably harming our school committee.

1515
02:54:54,850 --> 02:55:02,017
One specific area that will be systematically quote gutted as a result of the proposed budget cuts is our beloved music and fine arts department.

1516
02:55:02,438 --> 02:55:09,145
The current position of coordinator of fine arts plays a vital role in the daily operations of the music and fine arts department.

1517
02:55:09,605 --> 02:55:10,186
This position.

1518
02:55:12,312 --> 02:55:25,741
It coordinates numerous activities, including but not limited to scheduling all fine arts concerts and performances, band classes, marching band, color guard, drama club, and any music and fine art field trips.

1519
02:55:26,201 --> 02:55:32,546
We are especially concerned that this action will set a dangerous precedent, and it will become a larger issue if ignored slash sidelined.

1520
02:55:33,306 --> 02:55:42,049
Students deserve an exceptional learning environment with well-paid teachers and faculty, as well as a safe and operable facilities in order to thrive in a fast-paced learning environment.

1521
02:55:42,469 --> 02:55:56,193
It is for all the reasons highlighted in this petition and many more that we request just $5 million of the $25 million currently stored in the rainy day fund be used to fill the operational deficit for the 2024-2025 Medford public school budget.

1522
02:55:56,514 --> 02:55:59,434
This action will give the Medford City Government time to propose a 2.5% override

1523
02:56:01,195 --> 02:56:07,384
tax measure for property taxes, and provide the Medford community crucial time to vote on said tax measures.

1524
02:56:07,804 --> 02:56:13,793
Again, this is not only possible, but necessary in order to ensure that students get the education they deserve.

1525
02:56:48,288 --> 02:56:48,869
Thank you, Darren.

1526
02:56:48,889 --> 02:56:49,529
Thank you, Noah.

1527
02:56:49,549 --> 02:56:52,412
There's many, many pages of signatures here, so thank you.

1528
02:56:53,113 --> 02:56:58,399
And I think, you know, sorry, I'm gonna maybe step away.

1529
02:56:58,459 --> 02:57:00,781
Oh, is it, can you turn your mic off?

1530
02:57:00,801 --> 02:57:02,243
I don't think that's causing the feedback.

1531
02:57:03,666 --> 02:57:04,967
Okay, I think that's better.

1532
02:57:05,167 --> 02:57:05,987
I'll stand back.

1533
02:57:09,008 --> 02:57:11,950
I know that this has been particularly hard on students.

1534
02:57:12,410 --> 02:57:14,211
Thank you all for being here tonight.

1535
02:57:14,231 --> 02:57:20,934
I long for a day where our students can just be kids, and they don't have to worry about budget cuts.

1536
02:57:21,835 --> 02:57:26,680
And we're not there yet, obviously, judging by how many students are in the audience.

1537
02:57:27,581 --> 02:57:31,405
But you're, you've all been heard, you've all been heard by all of us.

1538
02:57:31,866 --> 02:57:37,452
I don't think there's a single person in this room that wants to make the kinds of cuts that we are talking about having to make.

1539
02:57:38,193 --> 02:57:40,676
And we will get to a vote that

1540
02:57:41,056 --> 02:57:43,057
sort of solidifies that in just a little bit.

1541
02:57:43,177 --> 02:57:49,380
But before we do that, I do want to hear from the community if there are folks who would like to speak.

1542
02:57:50,321 --> 02:57:53,402
So as a reminder, three minutes, please be brief.

1543
02:57:54,002 --> 02:57:56,504
And if you come to, oh, sorry, member of the potty, go ahead.

1544
02:57:57,324 --> 02:57:57,724
Thank you.

1545
02:57:57,744 --> 02:58:02,367
I think I just want to echo what our student representatives are saying.

1546
02:58:02,387 --> 02:58:06,228
And I think what we're hearing from the community and email and other communications and just passing.

1547
02:58:08,823 --> 02:58:21,210
I said something about this in the previous meeting where how do we weigh the costs of education to student preferences student interests and how we support our students in every aspect of their experience in the classroom and outside the classroom.

1548
02:58:21,790 --> 02:58:26,533
And I think that what's happening here is that we are all noticing and recognizing that this can't happen.

1549
02:58:26,553 --> 02:58:27,573
We can't do it this way.

1550
02:58:27,593 --> 02:58:28,894
Our students deserve more.

1551
02:58:28,914 --> 02:58:30,795
And I hope that we continue to

1552
02:58:31,315 --> 02:58:44,030
advocate for that and work towards finding some way that we can avoid these cuts or in ways when if we do have to have these cuts how we can consolidate properly so that student experience inside out to the classroom is not being affected in any direct way.

1553
02:58:46,332 --> 02:59:04,829
I think what's most important to recognize is that our students here are speaking not only from their personal experience from the experiences of those they are part of their kinship, the people that they're recognizing people that they're seeing as being ones who need to speak for what they believe in, and I can't thank you enough for being here and speaking for your experience.

1554
02:59:05,730 --> 02:59:07,911
I wanted to speak to Jerry if he's still here.

1555
02:59:10,236 --> 02:59:10,616
Thank you.

1556
02:59:10,636 --> 02:59:24,781
I said two quick questions on the slideshow so on slide five, and I just mentioned before from the previous meeting on May 6, you know, the the bullet points some theater sections will be offered as part of a teaching assignment to align with student interest.

1557
02:59:25,601 --> 02:59:39,365
How are we clarifying or how do we determine student interest because evidently students want these types of programs I understand that this particular point suggests that students are not as interested in the in school, you know theater program necessarily but out of school of course that's the case.

1558
02:59:39,685 --> 02:59:40,405
Yes, yeah.

1559
02:59:40,805 --> 02:59:44,166
So the out of school, you know, I think we've covered that that's.

1560
02:59:45,208 --> 02:59:45,748
in the budget.

1561
02:59:47,549 --> 02:59:58,571
This particular position, I think students fill out their scheduled preferences that just went through a process on that.

1562
02:59:59,192 --> 03:00:08,094
I think for this particular position, there were only 11 students over three sections that chose.

1563
03:00:11,269 --> 03:00:19,418
It could be a section for those 11 students, but it doesn't necessarily command a full teaching position.

1564
03:00:21,000 --> 03:00:31,031
And then on slide 11, with the guidance counselor for the FY 25 staffing, according to this, that you're not going to reduce the MHS staffing in any way, but for the McGlynn and the Andrews,

1565
03:00:32,014 --> 03:00:46,870
If we just, you know, just do the basic math if you were to reduce the MHS from six to four and then move to those counselors to the ones that make land one of the interest to maintain those staffing numbers from FY 24 at the middle school levels, I mean at the elementary, you would have a, you know, to 220.

1566
03:00:48,391 --> 03:00:56,156
students to one counselor, and then you would have a 295 to one counselor at the MHS, which is more consistent with the national averages you're suggesting.

1567
03:00:56,176 --> 03:00:58,398
I don't love using national averages.

1568
03:00:58,718 --> 03:01:04,982
I'm sure most of us would not like to, and I understand that we might have to in this unfortunate case, but that seems to be more consistent with that.

1569
03:01:05,342 --> 03:01:22,461
Yeah, well I think the, the main point, like, my, I am not the last word on this, you know, and this is the feedback from school committee, and then we have a program director so I think the bottom line for guidance counselors is.

1570
03:01:24,059 --> 03:01:24,559
very good.

1571
03:01:26,180 --> 03:01:27,280
Was it better this year?

1572
03:01:27,360 --> 03:01:27,640
Yes.

1573
03:01:29,341 --> 03:01:41,406
But, you know, the directors now can weigh in and kind of smooth out those, make those staffing decisions to make sure there's as much equity as possible.

1574
03:01:42,903 --> 03:01:58,871
And then I think the last comment is kind of piggyback off what I said previously, I think that when we are receiving emails and communications from people in the public and we're seeing parents and students, most primarily saying, how do we advocate for our students when we're not seeing that from our government.

1575
03:01:59,331 --> 03:02:04,894
We're not noticing how they're being supported and that's their responsibility and I think it's our responsibility to find ways that we're actually doing that.

1576
03:02:05,354 --> 03:02:05,995
And I think that.

1577
03:02:06,855 --> 03:02:22,124
At what point does it stop, because I think that member Graham mentioned that if we continue this, the previous meeting when we, if we continue the system of not making decisions that are going to financially support our students, people are going to come here and people are going to stay here and we're seeing that trend, the middle school and high school level.

1578
03:02:22,564 --> 03:02:23,205
And I think that

1579
03:02:24,265 --> 03:02:30,673
I don't know how to make the immediate fix and I'm not sure we necessarily have one direct fix and I think cuts is not the way, especially at this level.

1580
03:02:31,394 --> 03:02:36,800
And then we have the other amount of money that isn't really being discussed that could be even more cuts potentially and so I think that.

1581
03:02:38,570 --> 03:02:44,512
I just don't know what we do if cuts is the only fix, because at what point do we then start cutting programs?

1582
03:02:45,012 --> 03:02:50,534
Because that's not on the table now, but that will become a problem if we continue down this path.

1583
03:02:50,554 --> 03:02:58,297
And I understand that you're not the one that created the system that we currently live in financially, but I think that we need to continue figuring out ways to avoid cuts.

1584
03:02:58,917 --> 03:03:05,039
I know that our student representative suggested a prop two and a half, and other ways that we can improve our financial situation here at Medford.

1585
03:03:06,179 --> 03:03:08,400
I mean, we will continue to look for resources.

1586
03:03:09,121 --> 03:03:25,929
We've corresponded by email, but the interim health director is interested in Medicaid reimbursement, which we received some, but we could actually improve our reimbursement potential.

1587
03:03:26,109 --> 03:03:29,411
That might provide some resources for extra staff.

1588
03:03:30,251 --> 03:03:30,711
as well.

1589
03:03:31,592 --> 03:03:39,718
But I completely agree with you that, you know, this is a trajectory that we don't want to be on.

1590
03:03:40,599 --> 03:03:52,047
And, you know, the the school committee is right to kind of advocate with city representatives and our

1591
03:03:54,931 --> 03:04:03,454
Department of Education, Governor, field reps, you know, you should continue your advocacy to get the adequate funding that we need.

1592
03:04:03,474 --> 03:04:05,255
Thank you.

1593
03:04:06,636 --> 03:04:07,156
Member Rousseau.

1594
03:04:07,516 --> 03:04:07,776
Thank you.

1595
03:04:07,796 --> 03:04:15,299
I'll just be quick because Darren actually said something really important about time.

1596
03:04:15,319 --> 03:04:21,141
And Jerry, have you already begun projections for next year?

1597
03:04:23,859 --> 03:04:34,489
for FY26 on, you know, I mean, some of those things you can just stick them in a spreadsheet, find out here's what the teacher contract says, here's what the custodial contract says, here's how much it's going up.

1598
03:04:35,010 --> 03:04:35,971
Have you started that already?

1599
03:04:36,712 --> 03:04:37,693
Yes, yes.

1600
03:04:37,753 --> 03:04:45,180
So the salary increase of $4 million was based on projections for FY25.

1601
03:04:46,582 --> 03:04:50,866
I mean, for FY26, you can see into the future on some things.

1602
03:04:51,106 --> 03:04:53,868
Open contracts, you can't necessarily, but you can make a guess.

1603
03:04:55,109 --> 03:05:04,156
Am I correct that we will have a very similar nightmare next year if we do not dramatically increase revenue?

1604
03:05:06,418 --> 03:05:07,099
You are correct.

1605
03:05:07,659 --> 03:05:07,959
Thank you.

1606
03:05:08,119 --> 03:05:14,304
I think that's important for anybody who might be on the fence about an override, because if we

1607
03:05:15,529 --> 03:05:27,879
don't, then what we're doing right now is gonna seem like the good old days, because once we've, if we have to go through with these cuts next year, like, all those things are gone already.

1608
03:05:28,299 --> 03:05:29,600
What else is it we're cutting.

1609
03:05:30,421 --> 03:05:37,086
And, you know, I said in the last meeting, arts, and I don't mean all of arts this year, obviously, so $1.75 million.

1610
03:05:39,608 --> 03:05:47,474
But if we are multiple millions of dollars short next year, we're not cutting math, we're not cutting science, we're not cutting English, and we're not cutting history.

1611
03:05:48,094 --> 03:05:48,895
Can I get all of those?

1612
03:05:50,456 --> 03:05:52,057
Those aren't really, those are not options.

1613
03:05:52,277 --> 03:05:54,899
We're not getting rid of elementary schools or middle schools.

1614
03:05:55,359 --> 03:06:04,385
So when you look at what we will not be in trouble with with the state, if we cut, we all know what programs those are.

1615
03:06:05,083 --> 03:06:07,366
And there's a lot of people here from those programs.

1616
03:06:08,067 --> 03:06:18,600
And so we have this nightmare to get through right now, but the moment we finish and pass some budget, we are, it's like.

1617
03:06:20,031 --> 03:06:20,772
Rinse and repeat.

1618
03:06:21,052 --> 03:06:26,218
If we do not find dramatically more revenue for the city and the state is not going to come and save us at all.

1619
03:06:26,738 --> 03:06:27,499
They are really aren't.

1620
03:06:28,520 --> 03:06:38,051
And I think, you know, I certainly advocate with my, my state senator and state rep, and, you know, there's some improvement, but as I said in the last meeting.

1621
03:06:39,161 --> 03:06:53,057
The, there's no formula to fix Medford, because our property taxes and everybody wants to say their property taxes are too high because nobody likes taxes, but our property taxes are the seventh lowest in the state.

1622
03:06:57,604 --> 03:07:05,926
You may not feel it, I may not feel it and I certainly don't look forward to paying more in taxes, but the facts are the facts, so the state will not fix this problem.

1623
03:07:06,246 --> 03:07:14,669
So if we do want to have a public school system we'd be willing to send our kids to, we have to pay more in property taxes is the only actual option.

1624
03:07:15,269 --> 03:07:16,109
The only option.

1625
03:07:16,653 --> 03:07:20,356
Because we don't wanna say to the teachers, oh, you're gonna get 0% for the next three years.

1626
03:07:21,196 --> 03:07:23,838
Everybody's like, you get 2 1⁄2 every year, that's too much.

1627
03:07:23,938 --> 03:07:26,981
And then in the same breath, we're gonna give teachers 3% a year.

1628
03:07:27,281 --> 03:07:28,482
And I'm not saying they don't deserve it.

1629
03:07:29,603 --> 03:07:34,846
But second grade math says, you get 2 1⁄2% more, you're gonna give out 3% more.

1630
03:07:34,866 --> 03:07:38,969
Where's this supposed to come from?

1631
03:07:39,270 --> 03:07:43,293
The answer is, it's supposed to come from increasing property taxes going up more than 2 1⁄2.

1632
03:07:46,840 --> 03:07:51,102
That's not a school committee problem to solve, although we can scream about it till the end of days.

1633
03:07:52,002 --> 03:07:53,603
That's a city problem.

1634
03:07:54,583 --> 03:08:02,226
You know, Mayor and City Council problem and then the voters, and hopefully lots of you all will join in the drive to get people to vote.

1635
03:08:05,475 --> 03:08:17,263
Next year we're going to have this conversation again, and we're not going to be cutting a coordinator or a non filled theater teacher, if we have to cut many millions of dollars next year.

1636
03:08:17,283 --> 03:08:26,669
I mean I don't I don't want to say those words out loud, but we all know it is not math it's not science it's not English and it's not history it's arts.

1637
03:08:30,785 --> 03:08:31,406
That's what it is.

1638
03:08:31,426 --> 03:08:40,039
So I hope we can get past just tonight and this budget and recognize this is your engagement has got to continue.

1639
03:08:41,661 --> 03:08:44,846
Because showing up once a year isn't gonna fix it.

1640
03:08:45,988 --> 03:08:46,248
Thank you.

1641
03:08:56,400 --> 03:09:08,442
Member Brandling, so just to follow up, Jerry, you had mentioned that when things are cut, we would then talk to the directors about how that would happen, but didn't we cut the directors?

1642
03:09:08,462 --> 03:09:17,724
It says six, right?

1643
03:09:17,784 --> 03:09:20,764
Departments affected, administrators, is that the same thing?

1644
03:09:21,945 --> 03:09:23,425
Yep, but that's not all.

1645
03:09:24,465 --> 03:09:28,506
But I think the point is they're still employed at Memphis Public Schools through the end of this year.

1646
03:09:28,606 --> 03:09:32,847
So that work would have to happen in the right now in order to be ready for next year.

1647
03:09:32,967 --> 03:09:40,089
So if the contract ends June 30th and we get the numbers on June 30th, and you mentioned that date, how do we ask somebody who's no longer in the position?

1648
03:09:40,949 --> 03:09:43,710
I think the hope is that we would have those numbers long before June 30th.

1649
03:09:43,870 --> 03:09:45,250
Well, I have a lot of hopes tonight.

1650
03:09:46,630 --> 03:09:48,031
And I'm not sure that they're all gonna happen.

1651
03:09:48,071 --> 03:09:50,051
So we can hope that that's the case.

1652
03:09:50,811 --> 03:09:53,852
But is that really the reality if we've got those positions?

1653
03:09:55,411 --> 03:10:03,154
There are still a number of directors and coordinators employed to make those decisions.

1654
03:10:03,174 --> 03:10:03,954
But in different departments?

1655
03:10:04,855 --> 03:10:05,055
Yes.

1656
03:10:06,075 --> 03:10:09,496
But why would I want someone in a different department to answer the question about a different department?

1657
03:10:11,317 --> 03:10:12,417
Am I missing something?

1658
03:10:17,439 --> 03:10:18,940
The superintendent can answer if she'd like.

1659
03:10:21,939 --> 03:10:33,303
I'm asking for clarification, you are asking if the directors and administrators have been informed about the potential cuts.

1660
03:10:34,123 --> 03:10:44,706
Yeah, so I know that they've been informed in Jerry said that he doesn't have the final answers that he would consult with the directors and they would they would, you know, figure things out then but if we've cut the directors, how do we ask them.

1661
03:10:45,166 --> 03:10:51,311
So we have had, I have had direct conversations with all of the impacted individuals.

1662
03:10:52,472 --> 03:11:07,764
And what would happen is once we have the final numbers that we're working with at that point in time we will impact bargain with the union representatives and look at where the work would be redistributed.

1663
03:11:08,564 --> 03:11:14,606
So, I've been in ongoing communication with their representatives as well.

1664
03:11:14,886 --> 03:11:26,649
And so we're just kind of in a holding pattern right now, but there has been communication, and it has been clearly communicated.

1665
03:11:26,669 --> 03:11:28,269
Okay.

1666
03:11:28,389 --> 03:11:29,749
On the payroll positions.

1667
03:11:30,790 --> 03:11:35,131
It says that there are times people are waiting weeks or months, and that it would be nice.

1668
03:11:36,517 --> 03:11:43,903
that we could if we could get some of these reports that we've been asking for that some some of the things we asked for is a system issue, but some is a person issue.

1669
03:11:44,643 --> 03:11:53,530
So if it's a system issue, and we hire two people, we still have the system that we have to deal with that we're not getting a new one.

1670
03:11:54,331 --> 03:11:59,515
So if we have two people that still can't get those numbers out of the system, is it really worth hiring the two people?

1671
03:12:01,934 --> 03:12:06,518
Well, for payroll, we're suggesting going from two people to three people.

1672
03:12:06,538 --> 03:12:08,920
Okay.

1673
03:12:09,040 --> 03:12:11,683
And then for the retirement, does retirement not go through City Hall?

1674
03:12:14,105 --> 03:12:29,638
Yeah, the city administers the local retirement system and we have school staff that are members of the local retirement system and then the teachers and certified administrators belong to the mass teachers retirement system.

1675
03:12:30,120 --> 03:12:36,243
So that comes from that office you're talking about in payroll, both, I mean, they both have needs.

1676
03:12:37,263 --> 03:12:41,425
So do we know if the if the hold up is city side or school side.

1677
03:12:42,176 --> 03:12:48,719
No, there's a lot of requests for information.

1678
03:12:48,799 --> 03:12:56,221
So if people gonna retire, that's gonna trigger requests from information from MTRS.

1679
03:12:57,182 --> 03:12:59,843
Some people might be planning their retirement.

1680
03:13:00,003 --> 03:13:03,424
So they ask MTRS, what are my options?

1681
03:13:03,584 --> 03:13:04,705
When can I retire?

1682
03:13:04,765 --> 03:13:09,706
And so they have to come and request information from us to try to figure that out.

1683
03:13:09,867 --> 03:13:10,407
And then there's,

1684
03:13:11,167 --> 03:13:18,435
Every time we run a payroll, we have a need to do reporting to MTRS as well.

1685
03:13:18,735 --> 03:13:19,836
Okay.

1686
03:13:19,916 --> 03:13:29,146
And then just in the sake of education, I just want to get the definition of grandstanding.

1687
03:13:30,447 --> 03:13:32,328
It's a noun and it's derogatory.

1688
03:13:33,209 --> 03:13:39,294
And it says, it's the action of behaving in a showy manner in an attempt to attract favorable attention from spectators or the media.

1689
03:13:39,874 --> 03:13:43,217
So I in no way ever want to be grandstanding.

1690
03:13:43,577 --> 03:13:47,140
If I seem grandstanding to you, this is just who I am.

1691
03:13:47,680 --> 03:13:51,903
And I show my heart on my sleeve and I have passion for things that I care about.

1692
03:13:52,364 --> 03:13:53,985
And this is what I care about.

1693
03:13:54,145 --> 03:13:55,206
This is why I'm in this seat.

1694
03:14:04,679 --> 03:14:06,981
Are there members of the public that would like to speak?

1695
03:14:19,591 --> 03:14:22,993
Can you state your name and address for the record?

1696
03:14:23,033 --> 03:14:24,435
Benjamin Rhodes, 17 Palmer.

1697
03:14:31,700 --> 03:14:33,262
Benjamin Rhodes, 17 Palmer Street.

1698
03:14:35,267 --> 03:14:36,748
Ken Liao, 9L Avenue.

1699
03:14:39,090 --> 03:14:40,031
Members of the school committee.

1700
03:14:40,551 --> 03:14:41,532
My name is Benjamin Vertz.

1701
03:14:41,672 --> 03:14:45,475
I'm a junior at Medford High School and one of the drum majors for the Medford High School Marching Band.

1702
03:14:46,095 --> 03:14:49,858
I've been part of the band program in Medford since fifth grade.

1703
03:14:50,839 --> 03:14:51,739
My name is Ken Liao.

1704
03:14:51,920 --> 03:14:57,964
I'm also a drum major and also a junior at Medford High School, and I've also been a part of the band program since fifth grade.

1705
03:14:58,525 --> 03:15:04,069
And we just would like to share, I guess, our perspective on this and how it affects us.

1706
03:15:05,489 --> 03:15:18,902
We stand before you today to advocate for the position of the coordinator of performing arts within the Metro public schools, the coordinator of performing arts plays a pivotal role in creating and growing a vibrant and successful arts community in Medford.

1707
03:15:21,192 --> 03:15:36,111
They provide invaluable support to many performing groups, including marching band high school, the marching band high school concert band and middle school concert band, as well as elementary band color guard theater program, and the jumpstart music camp.

1708
03:15:36,832 --> 03:15:41,295
We are sure you already understand the numerous benefits of performing arts for us as students.

1709
03:15:41,835 --> 03:15:44,577
It's a valuable extracurricular activity.

1710
03:15:45,037 --> 03:15:51,461
It provides avenues for self-expression, connection, and it creates a sense of self-belonging and camaraderie.

1711
03:15:52,001 --> 03:15:53,462
And it also fosters school spirit.

1712
03:15:54,203 --> 03:16:00,747
We would also like to make it very clear that we understand that you do not intend to get rid of these programs.

1713
03:16:02,179 --> 03:16:09,203
However, by removing the coordinator of performing arts, you risk dismantling the infrastructure that sustains these programs.

1714
03:16:09,984 --> 03:16:17,988
Without adequate guidance and support, these groups will struggle to operate efficiently, leading to a decline in participation and quality.

1715
03:16:18,689 --> 03:16:27,674
So the marching band was hit especially hard by the pandemic, and we dropped from about 80 students every year to this year, only 14 wind players.

1716
03:16:29,151 --> 03:16:32,456
And evidently, the past few years have been rebuilding years for us.

1717
03:16:33,076 --> 03:16:37,162
And you can see this if you look at our elementary bands and our middle school bands today.

1718
03:16:38,584 --> 03:16:46,834
Just two weeks ago, at our annual spring band concert, we had an elementary band of 125 students perform for hundreds at Chevalier Theater.

1719
03:16:48,018 --> 03:16:59,972
And in just a few more years, with the continued support of this position, this director, the high school marching band will grow back to and possibly even surpass its former state.

1720
03:17:00,513 --> 03:17:04,678
And enrollment in the band class at the high school level tells a similar story.

1721
03:17:06,018 --> 03:17:09,420
Removing this position risks halting all the momentum that we've gained.

1722
03:17:10,120 --> 03:17:15,523
When momentum is lost, it is easy for a program to decline until it disappears altogether.

1723
03:17:16,183 --> 03:17:17,764
This by no means is a new story.

1724
03:17:18,404 --> 03:17:26,408
Other programs and clubs, like the Dance Department, or more recently, Interact Club, have disappeared because of a loss of vital leadership and support.

1725
03:17:27,649 --> 03:17:32,391
Again, we understand that you don't want to do these cuts, but

1726
03:17:35,402 --> 03:17:41,326
However, we also urge you to understand that the performing arts cannot succeed without this position.

1727
03:17:42,207 --> 03:17:42,447
Thank you.

1728
03:17:55,686 --> 03:18:03,068
Okay, so I'm a junior at Medford high and I'm the captain of the color guard team and I've been in color guard for almost five years now.

1729
03:18:03,809 --> 03:18:14,692
color guard has taught me the importance of leadership commitment and dedication and it has taught me to deal with my anxieties and just perform in front of large crowds.

1730
03:18:17,386 --> 03:18:31,765
The next two seasons of marching band and winter guard are going to be my very last seasons and I am beyond excited because I know that we will be able to bring home even more trophies and medals to add to our undefeated status.

1731
03:18:32,426 --> 03:18:41,750
During our competitions, parents and students from other schools will come to us and tell us about how excited they are to see our shows and how much they love us.

1732
03:18:42,430 --> 03:18:51,334
But this reputation that we have built as the Medford Mustang Marching Band and Color Guard will crash and fall without the support of Miss Rello.

1733
03:18:51,954 --> 03:18:59,477
Miss Rello has had many obstacles in her time in Medford High, and she has persevered through all of them for her students.

1734
03:19:00,197 --> 03:19:08,302
Whenever we lacked proper funding, she single-handedly started fundraisers or even paid out of her own pocket to help us win season after season.

1735
03:19:09,223 --> 03:19:19,229
Whenever we had nowhere to practice and prepare for our competitions, she fought relentlessly to get us at least an elementary school cafeteria to practice in.

1736
03:19:19,629 --> 03:19:20,990
It was certainly better than nothing.

1737
03:19:22,051 --> 03:19:30,414
In her position, as you've heard, she is not only responsible for Marching Band and Color Guard, but also the Drama Club and Jumpstart Music Camp.

1738
03:19:30,594 --> 03:19:36,335
And all of these have had the most successful productions and seasons in this year than ever before.

1739
03:19:37,056 --> 03:19:38,956
So I urge you not to make this decision.

1740
03:19:39,736 --> 03:19:44,758
You will struggle to find someone else qualified enough to fill such an involved position.

1741
03:19:45,358 --> 03:19:51,600
Everything we have built will mean nothing because we may never be able to reach the same amount of success

1742
03:19:52,168 --> 03:19:53,652
without her persistent efforts.

1743
03:19:55,149 --> 03:19:56,850
And I want to bring up one more thing.

1744
03:19:57,411 --> 03:20:13,201
The reason why we have such a small amount of students taking band classes is because of our poor scheduling in our school currently, like CTE exploration and the fact that there are not enough classes offered throughout the day.

1745
03:20:13,862 --> 03:20:22,888
And because of these poor scheduling problems, we have to make up for the time lost after school with added practice days.

1746
03:20:23,188 --> 03:20:25,009
So I just wanted to add that on.

1747
03:20:25,455 --> 03:20:26,055
Thank you.

1748
03:20:31,017 --> 03:20:33,838
Name and address for the record.

1749
03:20:34,018 --> 03:20:35,339
Chow, 65 Fountain Street.

1750
03:20:36,319 --> 03:20:41,381
So I'm one of the captains of the Color Guard, and I've been part of the marching band for three years.

1751
03:20:42,081 --> 03:20:53,146
And next year is my last and final year, and I can't wait to perform the last final show, wear my last final costume, and look at the last final props that I'll be seeing.

1752
03:20:53,846 --> 03:21:04,135
For the past 14 years, Mrs. Rello and our coach Jackie Gaffney started a marching band and color guard from nothing and organized each show for their students, for us.

1753
03:21:04,876 --> 03:21:16,345
And they have worked tirelessly so that we can have a show every season and even a better show every year and inspired us to continue our passion every single time.

1754
03:21:16,365 --> 03:21:20,329
And along the way, they faced a series of challenges

1755
03:21:20,769 --> 03:21:27,935
such as losing our winter guard floor and chasing after it, and dealing with understaffed positions dependent on stipends.

1756
03:21:28,715 --> 03:21:36,321
And the school only provides three marching band stipends, yet we have 11 marching band staff members during the fall.

1757
03:21:37,222 --> 03:21:51,577
And to support us, Mrs. Rello started a band parent organization to fund competition fees, buses, uniforms, flags, and instruments, ensuring that we can have a show, or even the thought of having a show.

1758
03:21:52,598 --> 03:22:07,526
And in my time with the band, I have never seen one moment where Miss Brello is not thinking about us, or working on the marching banjo, or even organizing concerts for the high school, middle school, and elementary school.

1759
03:22:08,227 --> 03:22:12,629
The marching band is a place of musical enrichment and belonging.

1760
03:22:13,029 --> 03:22:19,213
And the fine arts program may be identical without her, but the experience will not be the same.

1761
03:22:19,953 --> 03:22:25,356
And this place is our family, and it's become my family as well.

1762
03:22:26,116 --> 03:22:29,137
And taking this experience away from us would change everything.

1763
03:22:29,217 --> 03:22:33,099
So I ask you, please reconsider Mrs. Rello's position on the budget, please.

1764
03:22:33,779 --> 03:22:34,079
Thank you.

1765
03:22:34,099 --> 03:22:34,840
Thank you, Mandy.

1766
03:22:39,202 --> 03:22:42,503
Name and address for the record.

1767
03:22:44,284 --> 03:22:44,764
Good evening.

1768
03:22:44,844 --> 03:22:46,945
I'm here to represent the Banned Parent Organization.

1769
03:22:47,776 --> 03:22:51,499
I've been volunteering for the past 13 years and some of you may have seen me around.

1770
03:22:51,519 --> 03:22:57,124
I've also volunteered and events take place throughout the school, such as arts and drama.

1771
03:22:58,285 --> 03:23:04,950
And the main reason we're still around after all these kids, my kids have graduated, for the kids in the school.

1772
03:23:05,270 --> 03:23:06,071
I could go all night.

1773
03:23:07,310 --> 03:23:11,292
on why this is so important to the school and the band, Color Guard and drama.

1774
03:23:11,973 --> 03:23:16,175
The changes to so many of these kids' lives, friendships, bonds have been made.

1775
03:23:16,415 --> 03:23:22,859
I believe it's time that she puts into place to take.

1776
03:23:23,079 --> 03:23:27,141
I'm not sure if everyone knows how much time that she puts into this.

1777
03:23:27,722 --> 03:23:29,763
I'm pretty positive that no one does.

1778
03:23:30,864 --> 03:23:34,726
I'm talking about Mrs. Rallo, the endless hours that she puts in, above and beyond us.

1779
03:23:35,788 --> 03:23:38,269
in the stipends of payout in these positions.

1780
03:23:38,489 --> 03:23:39,730
Let me run through them.

1781
03:23:40,871 --> 03:23:48,355
Spring band camp, 15 hours equals five days, excuse me, five days per, three hours per day.

1782
03:23:49,595 --> 03:23:51,896
August band camp, 70 hours, 10 days, seven days.

1783
03:23:55,179 --> 03:24:04,047
We got weekly practices, 72 hours, 10 weeks, Tuesdays and Wednesdays practices, three hours each, three Saturday practices, four hours each.

1784
03:24:04,608 --> 03:24:11,835
NESBA competitions, 72 hours equals six competitions with practice in the morning, 12 hour days.

1785
03:24:12,536 --> 03:24:13,296
There are long days.

1786
03:24:14,217 --> 03:24:17,360
Football games, 16 hours, four games, four hours each.

1787
03:24:18,154 --> 03:24:21,576
game to set up and break down parades for fundraising.

1788
03:24:22,176 --> 03:24:24,657
Two parades, four hours each, and that's on her own time.

1789
03:24:25,317 --> 03:24:26,278
That's a total of 283 hours.

1790
03:24:26,298 --> 03:24:32,380
So if you break that wage down of what she gets for stipends of $3,700, it breaks down to about $13 an hour.

1791
03:24:36,155 --> 03:24:46,677
That's not including the trips that we go on, such as the Marching Down Main Street in Disney and Six Flags competitions, Hershey Park, NESPA meetings that take place 30, 35 hours a year.

1792
03:24:47,378 --> 03:24:51,038
We have a couple of trophies, which you've probably seen in the audience with us.

1793
03:24:51,438 --> 03:24:53,619
Over 100 plus have been won because of her.

1794
03:24:54,219 --> 03:24:58,120
She's always been trying to make Medford, the schools to where everyone wants to be.

1795
03:24:59,340 --> 03:25:00,600
There is no stipends for that.

1796
03:25:01,441 --> 03:25:02,481
So who can we,

1797
03:25:03,871 --> 03:25:09,633
get to do all that with the heart of what she has to put into it for less than $13 an hour.

1798
03:25:11,173 --> 03:25:15,074
I hope this will give you some information towards what she does in the city.

1799
03:25:15,295 --> 03:25:18,235
And she's so proud of us in the city that she provides.

1800
03:25:19,476 --> 03:25:25,938
So I keep hearing that she has, that we're not getting rid of Machu Picchu.

1801
03:25:27,098 --> 03:25:29,359
So she's the backbone of all this.

1802
03:25:29,899 --> 03:25:32,000
So is she walking out?

1803
03:25:32,080 --> 03:25:33,040
Who's taking the position?

1804
03:25:34,718 --> 03:25:37,322
I mean, it sounds like we're not keeping her position.

1805
03:25:38,464 --> 03:25:48,700
So I'd just like to know who's gonna fulfill all these drama, color guard, marching band, and all these other programs that she provides.

1806
03:26:03,624 --> 03:26:08,026
I'm going to ask the superintendent to answer your question once we get through some of this public comment.

1807
03:26:08,826 --> 03:26:09,186
Thank you.

1808
03:26:09,626 --> 03:26:11,687
Point of clarification, vice chair.

1809
03:26:11,707 --> 03:26:13,468
Point of clarification.

1810
03:26:13,948 --> 03:26:19,410
I know that we made a motion earlier to strike the addresses of our student members in the minutes.

1811
03:26:19,510 --> 03:26:27,553
Would it make sense to suspend the rules or make a motion to strike the students who have to speak further to give their address when they speak at the podium for minutes or?

1812
03:26:29,255 --> 03:26:32,097
I mean, most people aren't giving it anyway, or it can't be heard.

1813
03:26:32,137 --> 03:26:33,158
So I think we're okay.

1814
03:26:33,178 --> 03:26:35,399
If you just want to tell us your name, that's fine.

1815
03:26:35,459 --> 03:26:38,962
I just want to clarify and make that note to the students that they don't have to.

1816
03:26:39,582 --> 03:26:39,902
Sure.

1817
03:26:40,043 --> 03:26:40,363
Thank you.

1818
03:26:40,603 --> 03:26:42,104
They have your name and address for the record.

1819
03:26:42,484 --> 03:26:44,125
Brendan Crow, we tend to stick in the road.

1820
03:26:44,145 --> 03:26:45,867
I'm 19 years old.

1821
03:26:45,887 --> 03:26:48,809
I graduated from Metro vocational technical high school last year.

1822
03:26:49,369 --> 03:26:53,632
I've been a part of the marching band for a total of 11 years, four years helping my dad

1823
03:26:54,264 --> 03:26:57,748
load and unload the trailer while my brother was playing the drums.

1824
03:26:58,389 --> 03:27:03,955
Six years playing bass drum and one year coming back as staff to help march band after I graduated.

1825
03:27:05,417 --> 03:27:06,538
Now, was I good at the drums?

1826
03:27:06,879 --> 03:27:07,079
No.

1827
03:27:07,679 --> 03:27:08,580
But did I enjoy it?

1828
03:27:08,781 --> 03:27:09,281
Yes, I did.

1829
03:27:13,353 --> 03:27:29,766
When I first joined the fifth grade band class at the Roberts, Mrs. Rallo taught us how to play our choice of instruments and was already talking about students that they're able to join marching band when they get to middle school, trying to recruit them early.

1830
03:27:30,987 --> 03:27:38,733
Just a second.

1831
03:27:39,941 --> 03:27:43,583
As you have probably already heard multiple times, this is not a full-time job.

1832
03:27:43,603 --> 03:27:44,984
I mean, it's not a part-time job.

1833
03:27:45,004 --> 03:27:45,905
It's a full-time job.

1834
03:27:46,505 --> 03:27:52,629
It requires a lot of lost hours of sleep and preparation just for marching and what.

1835
03:27:53,509 --> 03:28:04,136
Adding on the hours to plan for the concerts, field trips, events around the city, winter guard and school musical adds a lot more hours of work and late nights at school getting ready for these events.

1836
03:28:05,000 --> 03:28:14,211
Without Mrs row the band will fall apart and without the band, and the other fine arts, we lose creative outlets for children who really thank you.

1837
03:28:14,571 --> 03:28:14,932
Thank you.

1838
03:28:22,781 --> 03:28:24,203
Is there somebody else who would like to speak.

1839
03:28:28,036 --> 03:28:28,978
address for the record, please.

1840
03:28:29,238 --> 03:28:34,806
Hi, my name is Jovia Maramba, I live at 50 Hicks Avenue, Medford, Mass.

1841
03:28:35,748 --> 03:28:42,818
Honestly, to clear up most of the confusion, which I'm sure you've heard, is there's not a concern of

1842
03:28:45,111 --> 03:28:47,852
removing performing arts, it's the concern of Ms.

1843
03:28:47,932 --> 03:28:50,334
Rello, because she is the performing arts.

1844
03:28:50,954 --> 03:28:55,577
And if her position is eliminated, the question is, where does she stand?

1845
03:28:55,998 --> 03:29:00,180
Because without her, she is, and I love all the teachers here.

1846
03:29:00,200 --> 03:29:02,702
I grew up in Medford, I've gone to school.

1847
03:29:03,222 --> 03:29:04,163
I love all these teachers.

1848
03:29:04,203 --> 03:29:07,725
I see some of my elementary school teachers here, and I'm so happy they're here.

1849
03:29:08,485 --> 03:29:10,647
And the one thing that I can say is Ms.

1850
03:29:10,687 --> 03:29:11,787
Rello, hands down,

1851
03:29:12,868 --> 03:29:15,489
is the heart of Medford.

1852
03:29:15,809 --> 03:29:19,451
She is one of the most hardworking teachers I have ever met in my life.

1853
03:29:19,851 --> 03:29:27,554
When I was auditioning for Drum Corps in 2020 before COVID, she would stay with me up until 8 p.m.

1854
03:29:28,214 --> 03:29:30,855
some nights just to help me rehearse.

1855
03:29:31,355 --> 03:29:37,057
The concern about her position is, yes, we understand that

1856
03:29:39,658 --> 03:29:45,901
that her job could, her position can be removed or replaced with more cost-effective solutions.

1857
03:29:46,481 --> 03:29:52,703
But there are hours, countless hours that go into such a position that you do not even see.

1858
03:29:53,224 --> 03:29:56,005
There are many hours that are unpaid that go behind.

1859
03:29:56,165 --> 03:30:06,709
And if taking away her position and finding more cost-effective ways to solve the problem are put into place, the integrity of our programs,

1860
03:30:07,729 --> 03:30:22,259
drama club of the marching band, even just other musical arts in the school, the integrity of them falls short because they're, as you see, there's not a lot of performing arts educators in the Medford public school system.

1861
03:30:22,600 --> 03:30:28,744
And there is an understanding that, of course, the major subjects, math, history, they're important, yes.

1862
03:30:29,464 --> 03:30:31,206
And there's an understanding of that.

1863
03:30:31,246 --> 03:30:34,048
But I, as an educator, I teach the Medford band.

1864
03:30:34,088 --> 03:30:35,428
I'm an alum and I,

1865
03:30:36,369 --> 03:30:59,512
most of my hours are unpaid honestly like I received a very little check this year and that wasn't even a concern of mine because there's nothing more rewarding than seeing children who have such a love for something you don't find that love a lot of places but you see kids who are marginalized every day if you hear some of these stories of these kids who struggle in school

1866
03:31:00,112 --> 03:31:05,935
and they have a lot of, children have mental health disorders and they're really struggling.

1867
03:31:05,955 --> 03:31:12,578
A lot of these places that they find healing, that they find connection is in these performing arts, is in arts in general.

1868
03:31:13,058 --> 03:31:26,565
And honestly, if we say that you guys are here for the schools, you're here for the children, why is there not a concern for what these children need to be able to thrive emotionally, mentally, physically?

1869
03:31:26,965 --> 03:31:28,446
Because this is why they're all here.

1870
03:31:29,346 --> 03:31:34,408
This is why they're all standing right here, because they feel like this is the only place they have.

1871
03:31:35,009 --> 03:31:38,110
And so, Miss Relo, she'll sit with you at lunch.

1872
03:31:39,070 --> 03:31:39,931
She'll talk with you.

1873
03:31:40,011 --> 03:31:44,593
She's someone, she's some of the only people that she helps kids get into college.

1874
03:31:44,613 --> 03:31:46,133
She helped me with my college applications.

1875
03:31:46,153 --> 03:31:49,395
Those are hours that can't be paid, that can't be made up.

1876
03:31:50,737 --> 03:31:55,440
So I urge you, the school committee, I don't care about the positions, I care about Ms.

1877
03:31:55,480 --> 03:31:57,362
Rello and who she is to this community.

1878
03:31:57,782 --> 03:32:00,864
And if you take her away, where do the rest of us stand?

1879
03:32:01,725 --> 03:32:02,145
Thank you.

1880
03:32:02,585 --> 03:32:15,414
Thank you.

1881
03:32:15,454 --> 03:32:17,535
Can you name her directly?

1882
03:32:19,660 --> 03:32:46,784
I'm a senior at Medford High School and I've been in the band for like six years and this is really hard for me to talk about but I deal with mental health struggles and stuff and a lot of my friends are in band and I want to see them thrive next year when I come back from college and I'm gonna join

1883
03:32:48,632 --> 03:32:49,952
college band and stuff.

1884
03:32:51,053 --> 03:32:52,833
And that's all because of the band here.

1885
03:32:52,853 --> 03:32:57,535
And it's really important to me that, like, I see them thrive.

1886
03:32:58,855 --> 03:33:04,257
And it's such a family.

1887
03:33:06,073 --> 03:33:10,497
I feel like we all look out for each other and we all help each other.

1888
03:33:10,977 --> 03:33:21,406
Like Jovia helped me with my college applications, like during finals, during finals, during a band competition, she helped me with my college applications.

1889
03:33:22,626 --> 03:33:28,271
And that's like, I feel like that's something you won't find anywhere else.

1890
03:33:29,372 --> 03:33:35,317
That's like a community you won't find anywhere else other than like the arts and with band.

1891
03:33:36,980 --> 03:33:39,681
And Ms.

1892
03:33:39,701 --> 03:33:41,201
Rello runs it all.

1893
03:33:45,163 --> 03:33:45,623
That's all.

1894
03:33:46,303 --> 03:33:46,703
Thank you.

1895
03:33:46,743 --> 03:33:57,287
Are there other participants who would like to talk?

1896
03:33:59,287 --> 03:33:59,487
No?

1897
03:34:00,207 --> 03:34:00,408
Okay.

1898
03:34:00,428 --> 03:34:04,689
Superintendent, can you respond to the question that was posed earlier before we continue?

1899
03:34:06,297 --> 03:34:13,322
I hope I'm responding to the question appropriately, but I have met with her.

1900
03:34:13,342 --> 03:34:20,768
We have spoken about other positions within the district that would be available where she would be able to have.

1901
03:34:22,428 --> 03:34:30,191
some flexibility, basically some of the work looking very similar to what was happening like two years ago.

1902
03:34:30,211 --> 03:34:32,971
So we have had discussions.

1903
03:34:33,452 --> 03:34:48,056
We have not fully identified what that could potentially look like, but the idea would be that if she was in some type of a teaching capacity, whether it could be at the high school level or working with elementary band,

1904
03:34:48,556 --> 03:34:59,022
she would still be involved in the arts, and we would work collaboratively to figure out the additional band responsibilities.

1905
03:35:00,323 --> 03:35:16,371
There is impact bargaining, which I said earlier needs to happen because she is part of a unit, but prior to two years ago, we had one administrative role which covered the arts, and so

1906
03:35:17,984 --> 03:35:31,230
We're going back to one administrative role working with the arts, but seeing how we could be creative to still allow our students to have an identical arts experience.

1907
03:35:31,750 --> 03:35:42,736
And so based on all of the work that we've been doing and looking at from a student perspective, the students would still be having access to all of the arts.

1908
03:35:43,556 --> 03:35:59,071
The one position that was reduced, we talked about at the high school level, that was one theater position where 11 students signed up out of 1200 students for three sections and that's just not financially sustainable.

1909
03:36:00,438 --> 03:36:10,150
But aside from that, that is the only official position that had been reduced, but it was reduced due to enrollment.

1910
03:36:10,750 --> 03:36:16,798
So even if we weren't in this predicament, there would have been a reduction there because it just wasn't sustainable.

1911
03:36:19,040 --> 03:36:19,381
Thank you.

1912
03:36:21,923 --> 03:36:22,984
Your name and address for the record.

1913
03:36:23,264 --> 03:36:35,573
Good evening, my name is Kristen Turner 38 a deadly street Arlington I'm currently a teacher in the public schools, the finance department performing arts specifically, I've worked with Mrs

1914
03:36:37,655 --> 03:36:38,035
14 years.

1915
03:36:38,616 --> 03:36:53,770
I have also been instrumental, no pun intended, in developing the elementary music and the middle school program, as well as currently the last three years as an instructor in the Jump Start music program.

1916
03:36:54,571 --> 03:37:00,695
And so I just want to stand with our students and advocate for the clarification.

1917
03:37:00,735 --> 03:37:17,645
Thank you, Dr. Vincent, for that clarification and what may take place going forward and advocating for our students at the high school level, because I'm most concerned about a comprehensive music program for general music,

1918
03:37:18,385 --> 03:37:21,946
band, strings, grades K to 12.

1919
03:37:22,766 --> 03:37:30,547
And yes, this does vitally impact our marching band, but it also impacts all our programs K to 12.

1920
03:37:31,548 --> 03:37:38,409
And for 15 years, I advocated and was the instructor for the district at the elementary level.

1921
03:37:38,789 --> 03:37:46,491
And in three years now, I heard the numbers for the Jump Start and the program going forward, we have over 120 students

1922
03:37:48,171 --> 03:37:58,395
performing at the elementary and middle school level, there needs to be an opportunity at the high school level to have that comprehensive arts program.

1923
03:37:58,695 --> 03:37:59,496
Thank you very much.

1924
03:37:59,516 --> 03:37:59,856
Thank you.

1925
03:38:06,089 --> 03:38:07,190
Your name and address, please.

1926
03:38:07,450 --> 03:38:09,811
Jennifer Silva, 49 Winthrop Street.

1927
03:38:10,731 --> 03:38:12,592
Hello, school committee superintendent and mayor.

1928
03:38:13,713 --> 03:38:14,473
I am a school nurse.

1929
03:38:14,673 --> 03:38:18,155
I am also the chairperson of the Mefford chapter of the Massachusetts School Nurse Association.

1930
03:38:18,515 --> 03:38:20,296
I'm the parent with children in the Mefford Public Schools.

1931
03:38:21,056 --> 03:38:23,537
Students were always a tough act to follow, but they did an awesome job.

1932
03:38:23,577 --> 03:38:30,120
And I want to echo, as a parent who has a student in the elementary band, that Haley Vallow is the heart and soul of our band program.

1933
03:38:30,160 --> 03:38:31,221
So she is really amazing.

1934
03:38:31,901 --> 03:38:33,942
And so kudos to all these kids back here.

1935
03:38:38,720 --> 03:38:42,021
I also wanna speak a little bit about the proposed staff cuts of the MISA TUC.

1936
03:38:42,241 --> 03:38:46,783
I am a MISA TUC parent, but I know there's tons of educators and parents behind me, so they will speak to that some more.

1937
03:38:47,923 --> 03:38:55,506
Just to sort of clarify some things that were said during the presentation, I wanna remind everybody that we do not currently have a director of health services.

1938
03:38:56,707 --> 03:39:04,049
Our outgoing director did give recommendations prior to her departure, but those do not match what's in the proposed budget that's been presented, okay?

1939
03:39:05,070 --> 03:39:07,531
Nurse staffing really needs to be based on acuity, not numbers.

1940
03:39:08,351 --> 03:39:11,882
The numbers that were brought up earlier, the Massachusetts recommendation of 1 to 250, 500 students, that data is from 1998.

1941
03:39:15,885 --> 03:39:23,691
The information from NASN, National Association of School Nurses, of one nurse to 750 is from 2011, so I think there have been a lot of changes since then.

1942
03:39:25,093 --> 03:39:29,837
Currently, the NASN position statement was reviewed and revised in June 2020, and I'd like to read it.

1943
03:39:30,617 --> 03:39:39,284
It says, this is the position of the National Association of School Nurses that access to a registered professional nurse all day, every day, can improve students' health, safety, and educational achievement.

1944
03:39:40,125 --> 03:39:44,388
Student acuity and school community indicators should be assessed to determine appropriate staffing levels.

1945
03:39:45,169 --> 03:39:50,030
Access to a school nurse may mean that more than one school nurse is necessary to meet the needs of the school population.

1946
03:39:50,051 --> 03:39:56,052
A couple of things that I just wanna give some real life scenarios of what these proposed cuts mean for nursing.

1947
03:39:56,953 --> 03:39:59,393
So it's been mentioned many times that the high school is not being cut.

1948
03:40:00,274 --> 03:40:03,154
Who do you think is gonna go to the other schools when nurses are out?

1949
03:40:04,015 --> 03:40:05,055
The nurses from the high school.

1950
03:40:05,135 --> 03:40:11,497
So we will be cut essentially because we'll probably have two nurses on most days if we have to go cover other schools without subs.

1951
03:40:12,623 --> 03:40:14,885
I'm currently based on seniority.

1952
03:40:15,726 --> 03:40:18,568
One of the nurses that sort of on the proposed cuts is a high school nurse.

1953
03:40:18,928 --> 03:40:26,974
We also have a high school nurse will be on maternity leave in the fall, which means one experienced high school nurse in that office, and having to bring people up from other offices and move people around.

1954
03:40:27,154 --> 03:40:31,738
So when we talk about a one nurse at the box or 1.5 here, those people are going to get shifted.

1955
03:40:33,959 --> 03:40:38,641
The Brooks, one school nurse proposed, sees almost 90 visits a day.

1956
03:40:39,682 --> 03:40:43,284
I don't know how one school nurse could see 90 visits in one day.

1957
03:40:43,344 --> 03:40:43,984
That's impossible.

1958
03:40:45,583 --> 03:40:56,129
Quick story, last week we had a situation in one of our buildings where one student was exhibiting signs of a seizure, while at the same time another student with diabetes was having a hypoglycemic episode, which means they were having really low blood sugar.

1959
03:40:57,089 --> 03:41:03,272
Both of these could have resulted in two medical emergencies, but luckily there were two nurses in the building who could manage both emergencies while they were happening.

1960
03:41:04,253 --> 03:41:08,475
If there was only one nurse available, that nurse would have to decide which student to care for.

1961
03:41:08,495 --> 03:41:11,436
I don't think any parent wants us to make that decision.

1962
03:41:14,457 --> 03:41:19,638
If there had been one nurse, one of those would have truly resulted in a medical emergency that honestly could have resulted in death.

1963
03:41:19,978 --> 03:41:22,959
Seizures, hypoglycemia, those are medical emergencies.

1964
03:41:22,979 --> 03:41:25,100
We need nurses on staff to manage those emergencies.

1965
03:41:26,340 --> 03:41:31,802
So I urge you not to pass this budget as is, find a way to keep appropriate nursing staffing, and remember that safe staffing, safe lives.

1966
03:41:32,942 --> 03:41:38,883
Thank you.

1967
03:41:38,903 --> 03:41:40,824
Can you name and address for the record?

1968
03:41:42,316 --> 03:41:43,238
Hi, I'm Theodore Norton.

1969
03:41:43,558 --> 03:41:45,501
I live at 9th Avenue Street.

1970
03:41:45,581 --> 03:41:51,289
Superintendent Edward Vincent, at the start of this meeting you said that the student experience at Medford High would not be affected by the budget cuts.

1971
03:41:51,970 --> 03:41:54,013
Anyone with a brain can tell you that is a blatant lie.

1972
03:41:55,117 --> 03:42:00,160
With the help of the performing arts director, the Drama Club put on its best show in recent, in my memories, history with Mamma Mia.

1973
03:42:00,861 --> 03:42:06,785
The band, with their trophies, has won a myriad of awards across the last, you know, four years of me being here, with the help of Mizrella.

1974
03:42:07,605 --> 03:42:11,488
The loss of this position, along with every other position being cut, will set Medford back years.

1975
03:42:12,208 --> 03:42:16,712
Classes are already overcrowded, and at every level of schooling, teachers and faculty are ridiculously overworked.

1976
03:42:17,232 --> 03:42:24,098
I'm an AP student, a class that thrives on individual attention from teachers and small class size for discussion and growth of individual students.

1977
03:42:24,719 --> 03:42:29,142
One of the AP English classes in my year has 29 students, one less than the required maximum.

1978
03:42:29,563 --> 03:42:32,385
That is not a safe place to foster a good learning environment.

1979
03:42:32,886 --> 03:42:37,149
Cutting these members will only ruin these classes more and take away from individual student attention.

1980
03:42:37,670 --> 03:42:39,971
To quote Nicole Branley, we are barely surviving.

1981
03:42:40,652 --> 03:42:43,214
These budget cuts will rip the heart and soul of Medford out.

1982
03:42:43,915 --> 03:42:51,701
Furthermore, in my four years at Medford High, I have never seen you once sit in on a class, talk to a teacher or faculty member, or talk to a student.

1983
03:42:52,101 --> 03:42:55,504
If you want to make these cuts, please know who you're talking to.

1984
03:42:55,904 --> 03:42:56,624
Make a connection.

1985
03:42:56,865 --> 03:42:57,925
Speak to anyone.

1986
03:42:58,206 --> 03:42:58,746
I beg of you.

1987
03:42:59,647 --> 03:42:59,947
Thank you.

1988
03:42:59,967 --> 03:43:01,949
Thank you.

1989
03:43:05,051 --> 03:43:06,292
your name and address for the record.

1990
03:43:06,312 --> 03:43:10,615
Hi, Stephanie Lomansky, 37, McSaven, Massachusetts.

1991
03:43:11,255 --> 03:43:11,795
Good evening.

1992
03:43:12,296 --> 03:43:15,858
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak tonight on the proposed school budget.

1993
03:43:16,979 --> 03:43:17,879
We are the Mississippi.

1994
03:43:18,580 --> 03:43:25,384
We are here tonight to talk to you about how cutting five teaching positions will impact our school and our students.

1995
03:43:26,045 --> 03:43:27,105
We love our students.

1996
03:43:27,766 --> 03:43:29,067
Our students are the future.

1997
03:43:29,847 --> 03:43:31,028
Our students are priceless.

1998
03:43:32,199 --> 03:43:53,071
While we understand the complexities around the school budget deficit, cutting five teaching positions from one elementary school, an elementary school that is currently in search of a new principal, with all of these changes on the horizon for our student population, we're asking you to rethink this very unwise decision.

1999
03:43:54,631 --> 03:43:58,694
Let's strive to do what is right for the Missituck Elementary students.

2000
03:43:59,354 --> 03:43:59,734
Thank you.

2001
03:44:00,315 --> 03:44:00,655
Thank you.

2002
03:44:06,104 --> 03:44:07,485
Your name and address for the record.

2003
03:44:07,685 --> 03:44:09,946
Yes, Barbara Burke 37 Hicks Avenue Medford.

2004
03:44:10,766 --> 03:44:17,289
Good evening, Superintendent, Chair and Mayor, thank you for giving us this opportunity to speak this evening.

2005
03:44:19,960 --> 03:44:25,585
I'm speaking on behalf of the teachers, the families, and the students of Medford, I actually grew up in Medford.

2006
03:44:26,086 --> 03:44:32,772
I'm a former graduate of Medford High School, and currently I'm a first grade teacher with over 24 years of service to our city.

2007
03:44:32,792 --> 03:44:35,194
And they'll always be a budget to balance.

2008
03:44:35,535 --> 03:44:40,920
Above all, it takes knowledge and good judgment, the original proposed budget, if it's passed.

2009
03:44:42,661 --> 03:44:48,443
that proposes these cuts to our school department, especially the Miss Tech school will affect us in the following ways.

2010
03:44:49,364 --> 03:44:54,446
We'll have bigger class sizes that will affect our social and emotional needs of our most needy children.

2011
03:44:55,026 --> 03:45:02,909
Since the pandemic method made it a priority to support all students with enough educators and programs in the schools to address their needs.

2012
03:45:03,689 --> 03:45:15,099
These cuts will not allow for these programs and teachers to continue to provide this support, the message tech school will be impacted the most by these cuts which also includes the therapeutic learning program as well as the newcomers.

2013
03:45:16,219 --> 03:45:24,907
We can all agree that the early elementary years are very important years that as we are building these necessary foundational skills for learning in life.

2014
03:45:25,507 --> 03:45:41,175
Research shows that having large class sizes impacts the students in many ways, including less individualized support for students overpopulated classrooms can cause more anxiety and children, and is a challenge to provide consistent communication with families.

2015
03:45:41,975 --> 03:45:49,579
Please put yourself in these little shoes of our youngest population and make a decision to put them first when making important decisions with our school budget.

2016
03:45:49,679 --> 03:45:50,339
Thank you so much.

2017
03:45:50,740 --> 03:45:51,060
Thank you.

2018
03:45:59,427 --> 03:46:05,892
I'm also a teacher at the computer technology teacher here to represent the specialist.

2019
03:46:06,933 --> 03:46:21,364
If this proposed budget doesn't pass and class sizes are adjusted to 22 plus, most classes will be even larger with the push in of the TLP and the EL newcomers, making our classes maxed out for individualized teacher support.

2020
03:46:21,986 --> 03:46:30,496
student engagement, access to all, all the materials, and not to mention the physical space, which for some classrooms is already at capacity.

2021
03:46:31,537 --> 03:46:41,608
Currently, we are able to provide that individualized support and attention to those that need as well as engage with students on a one-to-one basis at some point during

2022
03:46:42,452 --> 03:46:47,295
The class, as specialists, we service the whole school for only 45 minutes each week.

2023
03:46:47,855 --> 03:46:57,440
Having smaller class sizes enables us to cultivate engaging, interactive lessons and meet all student needs, each of them, at the Mesothoque.

2024
03:46:57,800 --> 03:46:58,160
Thank you.

2025
03:46:58,441 --> 03:46:58,781
Thank you.

2026
03:47:05,054 --> 03:47:07,015
I'm here to speak on behalf of the therapeutic team.

2027
03:47:07,315 --> 03:47:12,017
We believe our students will be negatively impacted by the proposed teacher position cuts to the building.

2028
03:47:27,242 --> 03:47:33,506
This year, over 25% of the Mississippi Tech student population has been individually supported by one of the therapeutic staff members.

2029
03:47:34,247 --> 03:47:45,395
On top of our 25% identified caseload, we also provide many more with in-the-moment counseling, crisis response, and or social-emotional regulation, and teacher consultation.

2030
03:47:46,716 --> 03:47:52,480
The students we serve require social-emotional accommodations and supports to be implemented in the classroom by those teachers.

2031
03:47:53,649 --> 03:48:03,571
These accommodations can vary and may include reinforcement systems, break schedules, specific communication plans for families, specific engagement strategies with each student.

2032
03:48:04,332 --> 03:48:07,932
Our success hinges on the hard work of the teachers to implement these for our students.

2033
03:48:08,633 --> 03:48:10,893
We have an extremely strong teaching team at Missittuck.

2034
03:48:11,333 --> 03:48:14,594
They are relentless in their willingness to support all aspects of our students.

2035
03:48:15,194 --> 03:48:22,656
They are constantly seeking our insight, our ideas, our expertise to make sure every single Missittuck student is given everything they need to succeed.

2036
03:48:23,416 --> 03:48:34,723
The current plan to cut positions will directly impact the ability of our amazing teachers to do the exceptional work they do, ultimately impacting the socio-emotional well-being and learning for our students.

2037
03:48:35,964 --> 03:48:36,364
Thank you.

2038
03:48:36,384 --> 03:48:40,147
Thank you.

2039
03:48:40,207 --> 03:48:43,669
I'm Julia Murphy, 37 Hicks Ave.

2040
03:48:44,950 --> 03:48:50,634
I am a special educator in the therapeutic learning program at the Missittuck School in my fourth year.

2041
03:48:51,653 --> 03:49:04,139
With all the challenges our students and our staff face throughout the school day, one of the most rewarding experiences for the TLP staff is seeing our students flourish and thrive in general education inclusion.

2042
03:49:05,480 --> 03:49:13,503
Many of our students use the skills they gain in the TLP to rejoin their general education peers.

2043
03:49:13,523 --> 03:49:18,866
30% of our program currently includes in general education classes and are not on those rosters.

2044
03:49:20,131 --> 03:49:24,253
When there's more students, including in your room, there are more challenges.

2045
03:49:24,693 --> 03:49:31,235
There are more voices that need to be heard, more accommodations that needed to be provided and consults that need to be attended.

2046
03:49:32,836 --> 03:49:40,199
What I've found working at the Mesitech Elementary School, when I go to a grade level meeting, is that our students are welcomed with open arms.

2047
03:49:40,959 --> 03:49:46,522
Teachers work with our staff to learn what our students need and how they can work collaboratively as a team.

2048
03:49:48,456 --> 03:49:57,380
When we choose classrooms for our students to include in, we look at things like class sizes, student need already in the classroom and best fit.

2049
03:49:58,281 --> 03:50:04,263
The best fit is smaller class sizes where teachers can give the students the time and energy they need.

2050
03:50:05,164 --> 03:50:12,867
When a student in the TLP is in a classroom for one hour or two, the attention from the teacher that they receive is vital.

2051
03:50:14,028 --> 03:50:18,310
During these times, teachers are providing accommodations not only academically,

2052
03:50:18,663 --> 03:50:19,964
but behaviorally as well.

2053
03:50:21,284 --> 03:50:29,748
With increased class sizes, we're not considering the students who are not on those rosters, like our newcomer and therapeutic students.

2054
03:50:30,668 --> 03:50:36,771
Our gen ed teachers treat all of the students in their building as their own and welcome everyone as they walk through the door.

2055
03:50:38,092 --> 03:50:43,094
Teachers meet these needs when they have the time and the ability and the resources to do so.

2056
03:50:43,888 --> 03:50:49,049
we are taking away resources from our district's most vulnerable students.

2057
03:50:50,990 --> 03:51:00,452
I was recently asked what the most important piece of the Missittuck school is, and that is the fierceness of our teachers and how we fight for our students.

2058
03:51:00,932 --> 03:51:02,393
And that's what we're doing right now.

2059
03:51:09,115 --> 03:51:10,095
I urge you

2060
03:51:10,785 --> 03:51:17,309
to consider how these cuts will affect our most vulnerable students in every piece of their day.

2061
03:51:17,529 --> 03:51:17,849
Thank you.

2062
03:51:28,823 --> 03:51:33,305
And I'm here tonight before you, thank you for listening to us and hearing our thoughts and ideas.

2063
03:51:33,826 --> 03:51:37,388
But I'm basically here to support the staff because they are wonderful.

2064
03:51:37,588 --> 03:51:43,391
They really are truly, truly, and I think anything I'm gonna say right now, they've said better than I have.

2065
03:51:44,091 --> 03:51:50,294
And I'm not surprised because that's how wonderful they are, collectively, individually, as educators.

2066
03:51:50,995 --> 03:51:54,797
And I've seen them for 12 years and I've watched them grow.

2067
03:51:54,937 --> 03:51:57,238
I've watched them come together and collaboratively

2068
03:51:57,698 --> 03:51:59,320
It's really a great place to work.

2069
03:51:59,360 --> 03:52:01,822
The Mississauga really is Medford's hidden gem.

2070
03:52:02,363 --> 03:52:05,806
And I've been here for 12 years, so I think I have the right to say that.

2071
03:52:06,046 --> 03:52:09,369
Maybe I don't, but it's my bias, but I feel that.

2072
03:52:09,469 --> 03:52:19,739
But I think what's important is, first of all, our adjustment counselors do sometimes teach classes, because that was brought up before, and I think it was said that they don't, but they do at the Mississauga.

2073
03:52:20,544 --> 03:52:23,546
The other thing is, I just wanted to give some numbers.

2074
03:52:24,127 --> 03:52:29,671
And I know that the McGlynn also has the EL newcomer group, but they don't have the TLP.

2075
03:52:30,291 --> 03:52:32,092
And that's the therapeutic learning program.

2076
03:52:32,173 --> 03:52:34,334
And they do, they're lovely children.

2077
03:52:34,414 --> 03:52:39,398
And as the teacher said, they're welcomed with open arms, but they do require a little bit more manpower.

2078
03:52:40,058 --> 03:52:49,045
And so looking at some of the proposals, if we go down to two, pretty much except for kindergarten, because we don't know who the EL newcomers will be, and they're all new.

2079
03:52:50,532 --> 03:53:10,637
Every class what I've done with the numbers that I have is once they go to their specialists, there's going to be at least 27 to 28 kids in that specialist class, many of whom do not speak English at all as their first language, and also one or two of those TLP kids because on some of the grade levels is only going to be two classes.

2080
03:53:11,317 --> 03:53:24,611
And as you all know, when you do placements and we try like Julia I believe had said that we want to do the best balance we can for the kids, so that they're getting the best education, and the teachers are able to give that to them.

2081
03:53:25,392 --> 03:53:33,400
And when you add children into these classes that that don't speak English, they want to be part of the group, but sometimes when there's not enough teacher.

2082
03:53:34,461 --> 03:53:37,462
ability to help them, then they kind of hang by themselves.

2083
03:53:37,862 --> 03:53:41,243
And they don't really get fully what they need in those specialist classes.

2084
03:53:42,003 --> 03:53:45,084
Now you add the TLP that bring their own challenges.

2085
03:53:45,544 --> 03:53:47,405
And like I said, they're welcome with open arms.

2086
03:53:47,765 --> 03:53:53,146
But I just do worry with the larger class sizes, that there will be something lost for those kids.

2087
03:53:53,406 --> 03:53:55,067
So I just want to thank you for your time.

2088
03:53:55,107 --> 03:53:56,967
And thank you for my 12 year share.

2089
03:53:56,987 --> 03:53:57,428
Thank you.

2090
03:54:12,835 --> 03:54:14,097
Can you name and address for the record please?

2091
03:54:14,117 --> 03:54:16,540
Hi, I'm Tara Hennessy, 59 Bowdoin Street.

2092
03:54:16,640 --> 03:54:21,065
I think you all received my nice long email I sent earlier this week.

2093
03:54:23,098 --> 03:54:30,466
Obviously my children go to the mistletoe, so I have one in fourth grade in the shrimp with his class when in kindergarten and miss Penta's class.

2094
03:54:30,887 --> 03:54:31,828
Sorry about my voice.

2095
03:54:32,308 --> 03:54:40,537
I'm also the PTO president, and have luckily served on the piece on the PTO for the past four years now.

2096
03:54:41,540 --> 03:54:50,989
And one of the things and I think all of these teachers have said it so much better than I could have about the welcoming and about the community.

2097
03:54:51,490 --> 03:54:57,996
That's one word that I think they didn't say, but is so important about the message talk, and that's community.

2098
03:54:58,476 --> 03:55:04,620
I think each one of them, I knew something about their personal lives, and they knew something about mine and my children's as well.

2099
03:55:05,341 --> 03:55:07,982
One thing I wanted to point out is that, you know, Ms.

2100
03:55:08,022 --> 03:55:16,868
Penta, she has 16 kids in her class, of which some are EL students, but we wouldn't know and identify them in the kindergarten yet.

2101
03:55:17,629 --> 03:55:23,573
My son already knew how to read, how to write, how to add, how to subtract when we came into kindergarten.

2102
03:55:24,173 --> 03:55:25,174
And so what did she do?

2103
03:55:25,274 --> 03:55:28,036
She quickly noticed that, and she noticed

2104
03:55:28,716 --> 03:55:29,277
He can help.

2105
03:55:30,257 --> 03:55:33,319
He can turn around and he can help some of these other students.

2106
03:55:35,080 --> 03:55:37,462
If there was more 22, 23, 24 in their class, would he have been identified?

2107
03:55:37,482 --> 03:55:37,682
Maybe?

2108
03:55:43,547 --> 03:55:44,027
I don't know.

2109
03:55:44,747 --> 03:55:47,848
That also happened to my younger son when he was in kindergarten.

2110
03:55:48,048 --> 03:55:52,430
That happened to be the COVID year where they got cut short, but that's okay.

2111
03:55:53,330 --> 03:56:01,152
Some of the other things I wanted to bring up, which I did bring up in my email as well, is how many of our students are on IEPs and 504s.

2112
03:56:01,852 --> 03:56:08,254
They're in our classrooms, they're being assisted with our teachers, but they're being pulled out for special services.

2113
03:56:09,234 --> 03:56:10,675
They're included in those numbers.

2114
03:56:11,837 --> 03:56:18,500
But now you're going from a class of 16 to a class of 25.

2115
03:56:19,480 --> 03:56:24,223
In fourth and fifth grade, you'll go from a class of 20 to a class of 30.

2116
03:56:25,423 --> 03:56:33,847
And then when you add in those EL students for our specialty classes or TLP students into our core curriculum, now you're jumping to 35, 36, 38.

2117
03:56:37,173 --> 03:56:38,714
in those other courses?

2118
03:56:39,734 --> 03:56:51,000
How is a specialist going to be able to notice that my child loves coding so much and is giving him extra work in her computer class because he's already done it?

2119
03:56:51,541 --> 03:56:58,464
And instead of him just sitting there twiddling his thumbs, is being given coding in third grade, now fourth grade.

2120
03:57:00,305 --> 03:57:05,228
So those are the things I want you to think about when you're thinking about cutting five teachers

2121
03:57:06,240 --> 03:57:13,926
from the Mississippi as well as thinking about, we don't have anyone that helps out when someone is missing.

2122
03:57:15,007 --> 03:57:15,968
So someone's sick.

2123
03:57:16,889 --> 03:57:21,552
Now that specialist, instead of having that specialist class is now in the classroom.

2124
03:57:22,713 --> 03:57:27,818
So what happens then to that 36 students that are supposed to be going to that specialist.

2125
03:57:28,418 --> 03:57:29,519
Now they're still with the teacher.

2126
03:57:31,263 --> 03:57:36,004
So please think about this when you're thinking about cutting those five people from the Mississauga.

2127
03:57:36,424 --> 03:57:36,804
Thank you.

2128
03:57:37,284 --> 03:57:37,684
Thank you.

2129
03:57:40,825 --> 03:57:42,285
Your name and address for the record?

2130
03:57:42,945 --> 03:57:45,026
Jessica White, 138 Mitchell Ave.

2131
03:57:45,986 --> 03:58:00,969
I am a speech pathologist at the Brooks and I'm here representing the related services department because I haven't really heard anyone here talking about the fact that the head of related services position has been proposed to be cut.

2132
03:58:01,618 --> 03:58:03,197
So I'm going to read a letter that we wrote.

2133
03:58:04,824 --> 03:58:15,891
As presented at the May 6, 2024 initial budget proposal meeting, we as a department were disheartened to learn that a special education administrator position has been eliminated.

2134
03:58:16,412 --> 03:58:21,355
It is our understanding that specifically this administrator is the coordinator of related services.

2135
03:58:22,116 --> 03:58:27,539
This is a decision that directly impacts the most vulnerable members of our school community.

2136
03:58:28,000 --> 03:58:31,702
And we strongly urge this position be reinstated in the 2024-2025 budget update.

2137
03:58:34,904 --> 03:58:42,327
As was discussed in the May 6th meeting, our district leadership and staff are already stretched in their responsibilities.

2138
03:58:43,027 --> 03:58:58,052
Like member Brandley pointed out in that preliminary budget hearing, without administrators who are experts in the fields they are overseeing, we risk burnout of the already overextended leadership and over-reliance on senior staff members.

2139
03:58:58,872 --> 03:59:03,554
As coordinator of related services, Catherine Cook works tirelessly behind the scenes

2140
03:59:03,914 --> 03:59:17,168
to make sure our special education students have access to the assistive technology they need, as well as ensuring they are getting the support they need for their speech therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy, vision, and hearing services.

2141
03:59:17,889 --> 03:59:20,652
We simply could not do our job without this position.

2142
03:59:21,272 --> 03:59:26,278
Whether it is making sure a nonverbal student has timely access to a working iPad,

2143
03:59:26,678 --> 03:59:39,364
with a highly specialized communication app, which is no easy technological feat in this district, or ensuring our vision impaired students have access to high quality orientation and mobility and vision specialists.

2144
03:59:40,565 --> 03:59:44,687
Catherine is behind the scenes, making sure that our students are getting what they need.

2145
03:59:45,962 --> 03:59:51,004
As a certified speech language pathologist, Catherine is a related service provider herself.

2146
03:59:51,505 --> 03:59:55,727
Having a coordinator with a background in the related service field is essential.

2147
03:59:56,187 --> 03:59:59,569
This is a highly specialized field, different from teachers.

2148
03:59:59,969 --> 04:00:03,611
We are evaluated on a different DESE evaluation rubric from teachers.

2149
04:00:04,091 --> 04:00:10,114
There are no other members of the administration that have the background to effectively evaluate related service providers.

2150
04:00:10,754 --> 04:00:19,321
Having a coordinator who is an expert in the field overseeing our department ensures we can continue to deliver high quality services to the students of Medford.

2151
04:00:20,001 --> 04:00:30,910
Catherine stays on top of the issues facing our disciplines when providing services in the school and supports us in implementing evidence based treatment across the district, while upholding IDA.

2152
04:00:31,650 --> 04:00:41,439
She understands what to look for in the quality of our therapies, and what professional development we need, and is a resource for us in both ethical and clinical issues.

2153
04:00:41,999 --> 04:00:47,664
We are deeply concerned about the trickle down effects of not being overseen by an expert in our field.

2154
04:00:48,425 --> 04:01:09,066
As a speech-language pathologist, speech-language pathology assistants, occupational therapist, occupational therapy assistants, physical therapist, physical therapy assistants, teacher of the deaf, teacher of the visually impaired, and orientation and mobility specialist of the Medford Public Schools, we simply could not do our jobs effectively without a dedicated administrator.

2155
04:01:09,827 --> 04:01:21,032
In line with the district's mission of providing equity to all students, the coordinator of related services ensures that our city's most vulnerable students get that equitable access.

2156
04:01:21,572 --> 04:01:25,713
Please reconsider reinstating the special education administrator position.

2157
04:01:26,214 --> 04:01:33,276
And I just want to add that I've already stated this, but we really serve a unique role in the school.

2158
04:01:33,296 --> 04:01:39,399
And I don't think that other people really understand what our licensing requirements are.

2159
04:01:40,152 --> 04:01:43,985
Um, and it's really important that we have someone who can help us with

2160
04:01:45,744 --> 04:01:51,287
not only following DESI regulations, but the regulations of our state and federal guidelines.

2161
04:01:52,507 --> 04:02:08,234
Additionally, Catherine makes sure that we have people from Perkins contracted to the school district to make sure that our visually impaired students have services with the TBI and the orientation and mobility specialists.

2162
04:02:08,594 --> 04:02:11,955
So I think it's really important that we have someone here who can help with that.

2163
04:02:12,075 --> 04:02:13,596
I know it was mentioned earlier that

2164
04:02:14,734 --> 04:02:22,159
We're considering looking at Medicaid reimbursement in terms of having more resources for the school.

2165
04:02:22,819 --> 04:02:29,343
Related service providers are able to bill for Medicaid services, and it's quite complicated.

2166
04:02:29,403 --> 04:02:31,344
We've been trying to figure it out for a while.

2167
04:02:31,485 --> 04:02:38,169
I think it would be helpful if we had somebody who understood our roles and responsibilities who could help us with that.

2168
04:02:39,009 --> 04:02:39,409
Thank you.

2169
04:02:39,630 --> 04:02:39,950
Thank you.

2170
04:02:48,924 --> 04:02:50,866
Hi there.

2171
04:02:50,906 --> 04:02:52,768
Hello, my name is Simon.

2172
04:02:54,449 --> 04:03:00,475
I live on 38 Corey Street and I'm a third grade student at the Missittuck Elementary School.

2173
04:03:00,896 --> 04:03:05,220
I think cutting the teachers is a bad idea because

2174
04:03:07,800 --> 04:03:17,031
I think having more students would make it harder to learn and because I would miss my teachers who helped me throughout the years.

2175
04:03:18,893 --> 04:03:19,734
Thank you, Simon.

2176
04:03:31,907 --> 04:03:36,869
I'm very proud of this time and that was amazing.

2177
04:03:37,290 --> 04:03:40,631
I'm Christina McGordy 24 North Street.

2178
04:03:40,731 --> 04:03:46,054
I wasn't going to say anything because I feel like the principal and the teachers and the specialists that spoke up.

2179
04:03:47,705 --> 04:04:09,758
On behalf of advocating against the cuts at the Mississippi really covered all the, you know, a lot of important points, but I wanted to speak just because since I'm here I want to urge the mayor to please please advocate or allocate more money to the school budget, and please please move forward with that prop two and a half, I remember sitting here last year.

2180
04:04:10,558 --> 04:04:20,384
And, you know, other years, and last year we were talking about it was going to come to, you know, the 2024 budget, and it was going to be worse.

2181
04:04:21,085 --> 04:04:24,847
And the only way we can, like, break the cycle is to get more money.

2182
04:04:25,367 --> 04:04:30,030
I don't want to see any of these things cuts, but I do want to talk about the MSATUC.

2183
04:04:30,751 --> 04:04:37,455
I think, you know, cutting five, really six full-time educators when you include the kindergarten, it's not feasible.

2184
04:04:38,135 --> 04:04:49,569
Um, I was pulled into subbing at the Mississippi Tech, because over the years, being in the PTO and working in the after school clubs and getting to show the kids.

2185
04:04:50,089 --> 04:04:54,655
I fell in love with the kids at the Mississippi Tech, and it's a great community.

2186
04:04:56,416 --> 04:05:03,081
I can say that when I have been subbing, like I did two long term possessions positions this year.

2187
04:05:03,642 --> 04:05:06,544
One was a class of 20, and one was a class of 14.

2188
04:05:07,145 --> 04:05:08,285
And in that class of 20.

2189
04:05:08,325 --> 04:05:10,707
It was the hardest 12 weeks of my life.

2190
04:05:13,329 --> 04:05:15,432
And it's not even funny.

2191
04:05:16,293 --> 04:05:29,530
It was really just, you know, there, there is not enough in Medford just to really service the needs of these kids you have kids who need social emotional health, and you know they're not enough people to, to,

2192
04:05:30,120 --> 04:05:33,042
like serve them because they're tied up in crisis.

2193
04:05:33,663 --> 04:05:43,229
But just having, you know, when you look at the numbers and you're like, oh, okay, these all come out looking around the same, but you really have to think about, you know, equity and not equality.

2194
04:05:43,269 --> 04:05:48,933
Like looking at the data from all the different schools, you know, we have 60% high needs.

2195
04:05:48,953 --> 04:05:56,639
So 22 students in your class where you have a school with a higher percentage of high needs, you have more high needs kids in your class.

2196
04:05:56,679 --> 04:05:57,740
And like they talked about,

2197
04:05:58,240 --> 04:06:02,463
We have, you know, more kids pulled in so that 22 isn't really accurate.

2198
04:06:03,524 --> 04:06:11,269
So, we, you know, we need more funds, we need to keep all our teachers, we need more than what we currently have.

2199
04:06:11,870 --> 04:06:21,336
We need to pay subs like I said I got I went to sub because I was, you know, so sad, hearing so many teachers losing their preps and so many.

2200
04:06:23,603 --> 04:06:26,844
like specialists having to do other jobs and not serve their kids.

2201
04:06:26,884 --> 04:06:33,765
So we need more if we really want to get to where we're thriving and not just scraping by.

2202
04:06:34,145 --> 04:06:37,866
We're scraping by now with these cuts, it's worse.

2203
04:06:38,366 --> 04:06:42,427
And yes, like come in, shadow people, like see what the reality is.

2204
04:06:42,467 --> 04:06:49,609
Like I'm speaking to like, you know, the superintendent and the people who look at, you know, like what cuts can be made, like come see.

2205
04:06:50,529 --> 04:06:53,931
And I'm not saying that in trying to be defensive.

2206
04:06:53,991 --> 04:06:54,491
It's true.

2207
04:06:54,691 --> 04:07:00,134
I think there's a big disconnect when you don't spend every day in the school.

2208
04:07:00,294 --> 04:07:01,094
But that's all.

2209
04:07:01,154 --> 04:07:01,594
Thank you.

2210
04:07:01,614 --> 04:07:08,698
Thank you, Christina.

2211
04:07:11,220 --> 04:07:17,393
All right, I am Anthony again at 45 Elm Hill Avenue in Lemonston, Massachusetts, and I'm the president of the Medford Teachers Association.

2212
04:07:18,255 --> 04:07:20,680
I tried to bribe Simon to let me go first, but he wouldn't take it.

2213
04:07:23,473 --> 04:07:33,555
Quick indulgence, I wanna say that this time of the year is really hard to teach in between the weather getting nicer, budget season, closing finals, MCAS, all that.

2214
04:07:33,615 --> 04:07:41,316
So I just wanna say to see so many of my students here, a few of my students behind this back, and all the members who came out to do this, this reinvigorates me.

2215
04:07:41,816 --> 04:07:49,978
So I'd just like to say thank you and I'm proud of all of you.

2216
04:07:52,248 --> 04:08:03,060
to be directed like just put my full support behind the budget that's currently on the floor of the level budget and to push this is not a radical budget, this is not a progressive budget, this is what we have now.

2217
04:08:03,100 --> 04:08:06,063
This is not to change things, this is to keep things as they are.

2218
04:08:07,639 --> 04:08:12,121
The changes that were recommended before would leave us in shambles.

2219
04:08:13,782 --> 04:08:16,003
Guidance counselors at the middle schools come to mind first.

2220
04:08:16,423 --> 04:08:20,845
The guidance counselors have a special set of skills, and we can have adjustment counselors.

2221
04:08:20,865 --> 04:08:25,467
The adjustment counselors are extremely important, but guidance counselors help with class placement.

2222
04:08:25,507 --> 04:08:27,287
They help with social emotional.

2223
04:08:27,948 --> 04:08:30,709
And if you only have one guidance counselor per school, sickness happens.

2224
04:08:31,529 --> 04:08:35,071
One gets sick, you're all of a sudden getting another position to cover the guidance counselor's position.

2225
04:08:35,839 --> 04:08:37,700
So it's not feasible.

2226
04:08:41,303 --> 04:08:44,245
We had a presentation today that basically said, MHS is trending in the right direction.

2227
04:08:44,605 --> 04:08:47,227
And I've been in MHS for seven years now.

2228
04:08:48,048 --> 04:08:57,174
And while I am impressed with it, what Principal Cabral has done is she has implemented the staff we have to make it run better.

2229
04:08:57,834 --> 04:09:02,518
And to say, you're doing well, now do better with less isn't reasonable.

2230
04:09:03,672 --> 04:09:09,697
So to congratulate the high school and then to cut six positions from it doesn't seem to make much sense.

2231
04:09:12,899 --> 04:09:16,061
We had the last meeting, we had it said that.

2232
04:09:18,615 --> 04:09:22,318
The administrative assistant said when she goes to lunch, she has to close the office.

2233
04:09:23,018 --> 04:09:27,141
So all of this talk of like, we need information, we need the school to run smoothly, we need this.

2234
04:09:27,942 --> 04:09:31,484
If you cut staff, eventually there's not gonna be somebody in that office to answer the phone.

2235
04:09:31,644 --> 04:09:33,946
And if that phone calls an emergency, we're gonna be out of luck.

2236
04:09:35,831 --> 04:09:40,392
There's a lot of numbers being thrown around about what is the ratio of counselors to students.

2237
04:09:41,272 --> 04:09:46,693
I'm gonna trust the American School Counselor Association, which is made of school counselors, run by school counselors.

2238
04:09:46,733 --> 04:09:50,114
They recommend a ratio of 250 students per school counselor.

2239
04:09:52,615 --> 04:10:00,356
As far as the Voodoo program and as far as it having well numbers, there are restrictions on the way things are scheduled as the schedule currently stands.

2240
04:10:00,436 --> 04:10:02,657
We also ran this for a year, right?

2241
04:10:03,735 --> 04:10:07,417
Yes, students pick classes based off of their interests.

2242
04:10:07,457 --> 04:10:09,918
They also pick classes based off of the recommendation of their friends.

2243
04:10:10,599 --> 04:10:11,919
So we basically ran this for one year.

2244
04:10:11,939 --> 04:10:15,041
We had two teachers in the position, so we had no stability.

2245
04:10:15,761 --> 04:10:18,023
And now we're saying, well, nobody wants to take it this year.

2246
04:10:18,043 --> 04:10:26,567
But again, if you run anything for a year and you don't have the stability of a singular teacher to sort of make that recommendation, you're not gonna get student interest.

2247
04:10:26,607 --> 04:10:27,808
You do have to run it for a while.

2248
04:10:28,948 --> 04:10:37,738
And the idea that we have the drum club in the budget ignores the fact we don't have somebody assigned to that it is a stipend that somebody has to.

2249
04:10:39,669 --> 04:10:40,329
volunteer into.

2250
04:10:41,030 --> 04:10:48,298
And I've had a lot of experience talking to teachers who have done the drama club and talk about the labor that they put into it and how labor intensive it is.

2251
04:10:49,199 --> 04:10:58,789
So if we want someone to run the drama club, but we also want to cut down on staff and make the job harder, no one's going to take that position because they're going to have to focus on what they contractually have to do.

2252
04:11:01,667 --> 04:11:09,532
I'd like to end by saying almost every award and congratulations given tonight before the budget talk is based off of a stipend or volunteer position that one of my members takes.

2253
04:11:10,692 --> 04:11:17,116
And there is a limited amount of time, a limited amount of energy that a member has to do this.

2254
04:11:17,336 --> 04:11:18,717
They want to do it, they love it.

2255
04:11:19,237 --> 04:11:23,420
I ran a club for four years before I had to stop because of budgetary reasons.

2256
04:11:24,474 --> 04:11:31,496
So I just want to say that like for all the awards are given out and for all the thanks for giving and for all the celebration of these students.

2257
04:11:32,057 --> 04:11:35,838
It's really based off of teachers who are willing to take it on.

2258
04:11:36,078 --> 04:11:41,240
And if we increase their load now, they're not going to take it on later, but we're going to lose these things.

2259
04:11:41,520 --> 04:11:47,642
So again, I support the level budget and I asked the mayor and city council, I'll be there tomorrow.

2260
04:11:48,122 --> 04:11:50,743
And I ask that this be funded fully.

2261
04:11:51,043 --> 04:11:51,363
Thank you.

2262
04:11:51,624 --> 04:11:52,244
Thank you, Anthony.

2263
04:11:57,195 --> 04:12:01,577
Good evening, Lily Scott 30 College Avenue.

2264
04:12:03,118 --> 04:12:09,960
I wasn't planning on getting up to speak tonight, but hearing that the most attack could lose five teachers was a real punch to the gut.

2265
04:12:11,281 --> 04:12:15,743
I'm the mother of a current first grade student at them as a tech and an incoming kindergartner.

2266
04:12:16,743 --> 04:12:20,545
Our experience at the message tech has been incredible over the last two years.

2267
04:12:21,789 --> 04:12:32,312
The community that the teachers, many of whom are here today, the admins also present, the parents and the students has been amazingly impressive.

2268
04:12:33,769 --> 04:12:40,276
I know everyone here wants what is best for our students, and those are really tough conversations that no one wants to have.

2269
04:12:41,197 --> 04:12:45,641
I personally agree with you, committee member, also about needing to raise taxes.

2270
04:12:47,002 --> 04:12:52,027
It's embarrassing that we've grown so much as a city but haven't seemed to be able to harness the commensurate revenue.

2271
04:12:53,529 --> 04:12:59,615
However, I don't think it's possible to understand the full picture by looking solely at student-teacher ratios.

2272
04:13:01,217 --> 04:13:15,249
As someone who accompanied the first-grade class on their field trip last week, I bore witness to the incredible challenges that our teachers in Paris deal with every day, including having to physically restrain a student.

2273
04:13:16,948 --> 04:13:20,271
The Missitech supports populations of students that needs lots of extra help.

2274
04:13:20,971 --> 04:13:24,774
And we know what happens when there's less individualized support for these students.

2275
04:13:25,214 --> 04:13:26,175
Everyone loses.

2276
04:13:27,176 --> 04:13:32,279
Our elementary schools set the path for academic success for our students' careers for the rest of their lives.

2277
04:13:32,920 --> 04:13:35,662
And let's not cut them down before they even get a chance to start.

2278
04:13:36,382 --> 04:13:36,802
Thank you.

2279
04:13:36,822 --> 04:13:44,008
We need an address for the record.

2280
04:13:46,462 --> 04:13:49,985
President of the Medford Marching Band Parent Association Organization.

2281
04:13:50,746 --> 04:13:52,107
Oh, wait a minute, I need these.

2282
04:13:53,208 --> 04:13:58,232
Okay, like you, Member Brimley, I can't read without having it written down either.

2283
04:13:58,832 --> 04:14:13,785
So as members of the Medford Band Parent Organization, both past and present in the room here tonight, we'd like to address the assumption that the extracurricular activities of Marching Band Color Guard and Winter Guard will continue with the operate,

2284
04:14:15,080 --> 04:14:17,782
with the enthusiastic support of the district.

2285
04:14:18,762 --> 04:14:28,969
The Medford Band Parent Organization has and will always continue to fully fund the programs that these kids put on every single year.

2286
04:14:29,009 --> 04:14:29,690
You all know it.

2287
04:14:29,770 --> 04:14:31,391
We come out to you for fundraising.

2288
04:14:31,671 --> 04:14:34,173
We ask you to place ads in our program books.

2289
04:14:35,694 --> 04:14:36,434
It's not easy.

2290
04:14:36,454 --> 04:14:39,777
I would not be able to do your job.

2291
04:14:40,157 --> 04:14:44,600
However, our kids are the ones that are losing here.

2292
04:14:46,528 --> 04:14:53,734
If Mrs. Rowe's position of coordinator of performing arts is completely eliminated, that's exactly what you're doing.

2293
04:14:53,994 --> 04:14:55,976
You're taking away the pride and power of these kids.

2294
04:14:57,237 --> 04:14:58,938
There's nothing left for them.

2295
04:15:00,360 --> 04:15:05,704
To have it as an extracurricular activity, it's funded by a stipend, that's right.

2296
04:15:05,964 --> 04:15:07,425
Mr. Crowley brought that up earlier.

2297
04:15:07,445 --> 04:15:12,850
283 volunteer hours is done by that stipend position.

2298
04:15:13,826 --> 04:15:20,110
So I ask you, if we don't have that coordinator of performing arts position, who are we gonna have?

2299
04:15:21,130 --> 04:15:22,211
Do you have somebody in place?

2300
04:15:22,691 --> 04:15:24,873
These kids have spring band camp in one month from today.

2301
04:15:26,314 --> 04:15:28,115
Do you know who is going to take on that role?

2302
04:15:29,195 --> 04:15:30,256
I don't think anybody is.

2303
04:15:31,817 --> 04:15:37,660
I'll continue with, this is hard.

2304
04:15:38,361 --> 04:15:40,122
I am a band parent for a wife.

2305
04:15:41,229 --> 04:15:44,131
My oldest child joined in 2012 when the band first started.

2306
04:15:44,711 --> 04:15:47,733
My 13-year-old now has been a member for three years.

2307
04:15:48,334 --> 04:15:56,539
And just to think that the possibility of that extracurricular activity is not gonna be available to him, that's disheartening.

2308
04:15:58,521 --> 04:16:09,288
I would like to bring up, I think we'd like to know how the current

2309
04:16:09,798 --> 04:16:13,202
two coordinator positions were absorbed into one.

2310
04:16:14,123 --> 04:16:17,727
How was that decision made and what was the process?

2311
04:16:18,408 --> 04:16:27,778
Did these two coordinators of arts have a application process or was it just deemed that one was better than the other?

2312
04:16:33,081 --> 04:16:50,765
If I may, what I would be at liberty to say on the floor, not getting into specifics, both candidates that are currently in the room are highly qualified artists in different venues, or in different domains, I should say.

2313
04:16:50,785 --> 04:17:01,587
In the past, when we had an arts role, it was one position, and that person oversaw,

2314
04:17:07,170 --> 04:17:21,059
When we had the abundance of funding back to the arts programming and added to position so we essentially took the arts divided the arts into two sections.

2315
04:17:22,385 --> 04:17:25,028
And brought on two coordinators.

2316
04:17:25,269 --> 04:17:31,195
So what we're doing is going back to one administrator overseeing the arts.

2317
04:17:32,417 --> 04:17:38,103
What I can say is that Miss fellow has been a public schools for 14 years.

2318
04:17:39,765 --> 04:17:45,070
And this fee has been public schools for 21 years.

2319
04:17:45,911 --> 04:17:49,014
So, they are both wonderful Mustangs.

2320
04:17:50,034 --> 04:17:55,619
So we have been looking at just other pieces of data.

2321
04:17:57,561 --> 04:18:03,085
We had to make a decision, and the decisions were really, really difficult decisions that had to be made.

2322
04:18:04,446 --> 04:18:07,068
And they both have strengths in different areas.

2323
04:18:08,529 --> 04:18:11,431
And they both value and support the arts.

2324
04:18:11,731 --> 04:18:14,713
So a decision was made.

2325
04:18:15,594 --> 04:18:18,956
But we are not impacting arts programming.

2326
04:18:19,056 --> 04:18:24,700
I'm going to continue to say that we're not impacting it or stopping it, because we're not cutting programs.

2327
04:18:25,581 --> 04:18:54,189
okay the offerings will still be the same for students if if someone were to choose to not do something then we would have to open it up to the other 20 staff members that are part of the or 19 members that are part of the arts programming to see if they would be interested in doing that so essentially you're saying that there is a possibility that there will be no competitive marching band season next year

2328
04:18:55,672 --> 04:18:59,073
I'm not saying that, actually, I think that is not what I'm saying.

2329
04:18:59,493 --> 04:19:02,813
So let me bring up to history.

2330
04:19:03,953 --> 04:19:05,854
I just want to remind you that you have three minutes.

2331
04:19:09,174 --> 04:19:13,775
Okay, that's still a lot of people that need to speak and I just want to be respectful of everyone's time.

2332
04:19:13,815 --> 04:19:22,637
Let me just end it with this that the history of the Medford public schools director of arts has always been somebody in the music, not the visual arts.

2333
04:19:25,316 --> 04:19:36,826
It doesn't make any sense that you're going to give a director of arts position for somebody that's going to cover the performing arts, who has no experience, education, or knowledge.

2334
04:19:37,366 --> 04:19:37,706
Thank you.

2335
04:19:38,026 --> 04:19:38,507
Thank you.

2336
04:19:46,854 --> 04:19:47,814
Your name for the record?

2337
04:19:48,435 --> 04:19:50,277
Megan Smith, 7 Arden Road.

2338
04:19:50,777 --> 04:19:51,998
Faylu Hadgimbis, 31 Lylav.

2339
04:19:53,786 --> 04:19:58,993
We are here to address an issue that is not only close to our hearts, but vital to the fabric of our community.

2340
04:19:59,654 --> 04:20:05,081
The proposed budget cuts that jeopardize the continuity of the band program and the performing arts at our schools.

2341
04:20:06,038 --> 04:20:07,499
Bailu and I are both alumni.

2342
04:20:07,779 --> 04:20:11,021
I graduated in 2019 and Bailu in 2021.

2343
04:20:11,842 --> 04:20:17,025
I first joined band in fifth grade, inspired by my mom who had been a part of it and encouraged me to give it a try.

2344
04:20:17,845 --> 04:20:24,409
My passion for band grew over the years, leading me to join the marching band in high school, where I served as drum major and treasurer.

2345
04:20:25,530 --> 04:20:35,576
Band has always been a way for me to connect with my mom and has become an integral part of my life, bringing me some of my closest friends and has been instrumental in forming connections throughout my adult life.

2346
04:20:37,489 --> 04:20:44,615
When I first joined the marching band in seventh grade, I was excited but nervous and wondered how I would be perceived as I was one of the youngest members that year.

2347
04:20:45,276 --> 04:20:50,761
But after the first day at band camp, despite the scorching sun, I instantly felt like I found my group of people.

2348
04:20:51,261 --> 04:20:54,784
For example, I met Megan there and now we've been friends for 10 years.

2349
04:20:55,485 --> 04:21:02,131
As my passion deepened over the years, I took on more leadership roles, ultimately serving as president during both my junior and senior years.

2350
04:21:05,154 --> 04:21:08,656
Our band director, Haley Rello, has been the cornerstone of this program.

2351
04:21:09,276 --> 04:21:16,561
Her dedication, passion, and relentless effort over the past decade have elevated the band and its accomplishments to a national level.

2352
04:21:17,321 --> 04:21:24,906
She has not only taught us how to read notes and play our instruments, but also instilled in us the values of discipline, teamwork, and perseverance.

2353
04:21:25,666 --> 04:21:32,030
Under her guidance, we learned that our success depends not just on individual talent, but on our collective effort and harmony.

2354
04:21:34,508 --> 04:21:41,014
Now faced with the possibility of budget cuts, we are at risk of losing this irreplaceable mentor and the program she has built.

2355
04:21:41,674 --> 04:21:50,482
This decision would not only impact current students, but also deprive future generations of the opportunity to experience the transformative power of the performing arts.

2356
04:21:51,202 --> 04:21:54,085
The ripple effect of this loss would be felt throughout our community.

2357
04:21:54,645 --> 04:22:00,610
Parents, families, alumni, and local supporters who have all marched alongside the band throughout the years.

2358
04:22:01,351 --> 04:22:03,754
The performing arts are more than just entertainment.

2359
04:22:04,214 --> 04:22:11,102
The arts foster creativity, critical thinking, and emotional expression, skills that are essential in every aspect of life.

2360
04:22:12,148 --> 04:22:16,890
Moreover, band and drama are often safe havens for students who may not find their place elsewhere.

2361
04:22:17,390 --> 04:22:21,512
They provide a sense of belonging and purpose, a chance to shine and to be heard.

2362
04:22:22,173 --> 04:22:26,434
Band was not merely an extracurricular activity for us, it was a safe space.

2363
04:22:26,975 --> 04:22:32,017
It was a place where we felt welcomed, valued, and truly a part of something larger than ourselves.

2364
04:22:32,777 --> 04:22:38,420
Removing these programs would strip away these safe spaces and the opportunities they provide for self-discovery and growth.

2365
04:22:40,694 --> 04:22:47,057
We stand before you today, not just as former band members, but as a testament to the profound impact this program has had.

2366
04:22:47,827 --> 04:22:51,350
We implore you to consider the far-reaching consequences of these budget cuts.

2367
04:22:51,930 --> 04:22:57,655
We must invest in our students' futures by preserving the programs that nurture their talents, their spirits, and their hearts.

2368
04:22:58,416 --> 04:23:00,378
Let us not take away the heartbeat of Medford.

2369
04:23:00,818 --> 04:23:05,142
Let us fight to keep our band director, our band, and our performing arts programs alive.

2370
04:23:05,722 --> 04:23:13,268
For the sake of our students, our community, and the legacy we leave behind, we must stand together and ensure that these vital programs continue to flourish.

2371
04:23:13,789 --> 04:23:14,169
Thank you.

2372
04:23:14,509 --> 04:23:14,850
Thank you.

2373
04:23:22,335 --> 04:23:23,556
Can you name and address for the record?

2374
04:23:24,237 --> 04:23:26,278
Rick McLaughlin, 87 West Street.

2375
04:23:26,859 --> 04:23:29,781
I'm compelled to speak with you today for three reasons.

2376
04:23:30,402 --> 04:23:38,248
The first is as the father of an alumna who was in the marching band, I've seen other things, the same things that the students have already spoken about and what other parents have spoken about.

2377
04:23:38,268 --> 04:23:42,271
So I'm not gonna, I'll just say yes to what they've said.

2378
04:23:42,691 --> 04:23:48,436
The second reason is I'm the son of a career music educator, taught music in public schools for 40 years.

2379
04:23:49,457 --> 04:23:51,819
And he told me in the 1970s that this would happen.

2380
04:23:52,259 --> 04:23:53,540
I'm going to tell you about that in a second.

2381
04:23:53,600 --> 04:24:04,346
The third reason is because as a professional musician myself and professor at the most influential school of music in the world, I've seen the power of music on four continents, both as a performer and as a clinician.

2382
04:24:05,227 --> 04:24:09,709
So my dad, he taught music in public schools for 40 years.

2383
04:24:09,729 --> 04:24:20,896
I remember in the 1970s, he told me that one day what would happen is the school committee or principals or whoever was actually managing money would cut the music program enough

2384
04:24:21,656 --> 04:24:29,203
that it just, it wouldn't cut it completely, just enough to let it die, which is what is happening.

2385
04:24:29,383 --> 04:24:32,606
You say that you're going to still support the arts, that's not true.

2386
04:24:33,727 --> 04:24:40,293
The impact that other people have already discussed, you should take to heart because it's very important.

2387
04:24:40,313 --> 04:24:50,223
But there's another element that's very important, which is the mission of the Medford Public Schools is to provide a supportive and effective educational environment that helps students successfully meet their individualized goals.

2388
04:24:50,283 --> 04:24:53,005
This will no longer be true when you cut Ms.

2389
04:24:53,025 --> 04:24:53,806
Ferrello's position.

2390
04:24:54,467 --> 04:24:57,269
By cutting her position, you will make it so that

2391
04:24:58,030 --> 04:25:00,292
Future students do not sign up for music.

2392
04:25:00,732 --> 04:25:08,479
A previous student spoke about how it's virtually impossible to do it anyway because of the ways that the scheduling conflicts prevent them from actually taking these courses.

2393
04:25:10,171 --> 04:25:13,454
M-Y-E-L-I-N, myelin.

2394
04:25:13,954 --> 04:25:24,382
That is the aspect of the brain, the neurological neuron wrapping that actually makes your brain process information more effectively and more quickly.

2395
04:25:25,063 --> 04:25:38,093
None of the things that you teach in school, none of the things Mr. Rousseau referred to earlier, English, math, science, history, I can't remember what the rest was on his list, none of those things actually improve or increase brain processing speed

2396
04:25:38,813 --> 04:25:41,394
The only thing that does is music.

2397
04:25:41,974 --> 04:25:47,256
By cutting Miss Rello's position, you no longer support the arts.

2398
04:25:47,716 --> 04:25:54,778
You also no longer support the mission of the school because you no longer support the brain health of the students who go here.

2399
04:25:55,438 --> 04:25:55,758
Thank you.

2400
04:25:56,239 --> 04:25:56,699
Thank you.

2401
04:25:56,719 --> 04:26:03,441
Do you need an address for the record?

2402
04:26:04,980 --> 04:26:05,180
Nice.

2403
04:26:05,480 --> 04:26:06,580
My name is Jerry Herskowitz.

2404
04:26:06,760 --> 04:26:08,281
I live at 72 Wareham Street.

2405
04:26:09,901 --> 04:26:11,081
I have, let's see.

2406
04:26:11,262 --> 04:26:14,322
So I have a child in fourth grade at the Missituck School.

2407
04:26:14,342 --> 04:26:18,403
I also happen to be the PTO treasurer of the Missituck School.

2408
04:26:18,443 --> 04:26:21,764
So I understand some of these challenges with trying to balance the budget.

2409
04:26:24,085 --> 04:26:32,387
I want to mention one of the practical things of potentially larger class sizes with fewer teachers at the Missituck next year.

2410
04:26:34,631 --> 04:26:42,372
So in my child's class this year, a class of 20, as I understand it, there are disciplinary problems in the class.

2411
04:26:43,662 --> 04:26:45,323
Teachers haven't told me about them.

2412
04:26:45,363 --> 04:26:46,644
I hear it from my child.

2413
04:26:46,944 --> 04:26:51,587
So I don't think my child is the cause of them, but there are problems in the class.

2414
04:26:51,827 --> 04:26:55,769
And with a class of 20, as I understand it, it's close to overbearing.

2415
04:26:56,049 --> 04:27:05,654
And I can't imagine what the mix of kids would be with even larger class sizes and how the teacher would have to deal with those disciplinary problems.

2416
04:27:06,115 --> 04:27:11,658
So think about that as we're thinking about how we manage things for next year.

2417
04:27:12,526 --> 04:27:19,089
Thank you.

2418
04:27:20,050 --> 04:27:24,032
Sharon Hayes 69 Ripley Road think I'm more nervous on this side.

2419
04:27:26,813 --> 04:27:39,079
I'm not here to advocate for any particular position or program, because as a parent I realized that every single one of these cuts will affect my children.

2420
04:27:40,199 --> 04:27:44,742
directly or indirectly, immediately or in the future as a long-term impact.

2421
04:27:45,203 --> 04:27:47,224
And that's true for all of our students.

2422
04:27:49,806 --> 04:28:08,440
As a parent of an elementary school student who's at the largest school with the currently largest class size, I can echo the worries that the Missittook has about what larger class size, what the impact is on students.

2423
04:28:09,646 --> 04:28:28,483
We similarly, at the Roberts, in our class sizes of 20 or more, there are a bunch of classes that have some significant emotional behavioral needs, ones that don't qualify for special education supports, but who need supports.

2424
04:28:29,023 --> 04:28:34,048
And as a school district, we have been lean for a very long time, and so,

2425
04:28:35,310 --> 04:28:42,852
We also don't have those extra supports that a lot of other schools, other school districts might have.

2426
04:28:43,272 --> 04:28:45,693
We don't have a lot of reading specialists.

2427
04:28:45,713 --> 04:28:47,754
We don't have math specialists.

2428
04:28:49,194 --> 04:28:55,296
We don't have probably as many adjustment counselors as we need, given the needs of our students.

2429
04:28:55,936 --> 04:29:01,978
So when you then increase class sizes, and even if it's only by one, two, three students,

2430
04:29:03,041 --> 04:29:07,782
The impact on the students, the impact on the teachers is huge.

2431
04:29:08,162 --> 04:29:13,783
And we know that across the country and certainly in our district, teachers are burned out.

2432
04:29:14,543 --> 04:29:19,624
And if you then add to that by increasing the class sizes, you know.

2433
04:29:21,084 --> 04:29:29,846
I'm also the parent of a marching band student, orchestra student, a regular band student.

2434
04:29:31,673 --> 04:29:44,100
I know the impact that that will have if we cut anywhere in the performing arts, any position that's going to necessarily have a ripple effect.

2435
04:29:46,182 --> 04:29:47,642
Again, I could go through any of these.

2436
04:29:47,662 --> 04:29:49,303
One more, just I took some notes.

2437
04:29:49,784 --> 04:29:51,224
When I think of the nursing staff,

2438
04:29:53,035 --> 04:29:55,917
I can say from personal experience where my kids were very little.

2439
04:29:56,897 --> 04:30:00,059
Both of them had some real school anxiety.

2440
04:30:00,599 --> 04:30:13,007
And when they needed a break from the classroom where they had somatic responses to their anxiety, where did the teacher send them to the nurse's office, not because they were sick, but because that was a place they could have a break.

2441
04:30:14,755 --> 04:30:16,596
Maybe they could lie down on one of the little beds.

2442
04:30:16,997 --> 04:30:24,662
They got a little TLC from the nurses who were absolutely amazing, who would call me and say, you know, your child's here, but he's fine.

2443
04:30:25,302 --> 04:30:27,023
Just want you to know that he's here.

2444
04:30:29,085 --> 04:30:43,014
So it kind of, as I was sitting back there, you know, my stomach started to twist just hearing people come up and, you know, everybody's fighting for the pennies and the nickels and the dimes.

2445
04:30:46,061 --> 04:31:09,113
I think we as a community and I know I think member Graham said this earlier, and I think every school can remember said this at some point, we need to come together and decide how much do we value our educational system, how much do we value our public schools, and what are we willing to do to fund them to a level that meets that value that we get from them.

2446
04:31:09,693 --> 04:31:12,775
And so I hope people will take away from this not just

2447
04:31:14,755 --> 04:31:35,578
You know my, my program may be cut that my child's in or, you know, something in particular my child needs is being cut, but as a whole, our school system is being decimated, which might be a little strong but we're being cut after cut year after year there are positions that the school committee, I can say having been on the school

2448
04:31:36,565 --> 04:31:44,651
wanted, not just wanted, but felt were really necessary to really have a high quality education for our students.

2449
04:31:44,972 --> 04:31:51,176
And they would get cut, those positions like literacy specialists would get cut very early in the budget season.

2450
04:31:51,236 --> 04:31:58,982
So the people who walk away from this just thinking about what do we do to make sure we have more money in the future?

2451
04:31:59,002 --> 04:32:02,465
I hope people will walk away with that because

2452
04:32:03,277 --> 04:32:08,141
This isn't gonna get solved by one program being reinstated or one teacher being reinstated.

2453
04:32:08,601 --> 04:32:19,809
This is going to, I think, as member Rousseau asked and as Jerry McHugh answered, this is gonna happen again next year if we don't do something about it.

2454
04:32:19,969 --> 04:32:27,935
We're gonna be back in these meetings talking about what positions are we gonna cut now and what impact is that gonna have on our kids and our teachers.

2455
04:32:28,015 --> 04:32:32,459
So I hope people think a lot about that and think about what we need

2456
04:32:38,951 --> 04:32:40,892
Thank you.

2457
04:32:41,352 --> 04:32:43,454
I'm the vice president of the secretaries union.

2458
04:32:43,854 --> 04:32:45,495
Yes I say secretaries I'm old school.

2459
04:32:46,315 --> 04:32:55,540
So, first I'd like to, again this week, I'd like you to reconsider the McGlynn school position for the secretaries.

2460
04:32:57,261 --> 04:32:57,741
Let's see.

2461
04:32:58,102 --> 04:32:58,902
So they only have 192.

2462
04:33:01,292 --> 04:33:03,433
students less than the high school in Vogue.

2463
04:33:04,714 --> 04:33:14,038
And the high school has the vocational secretary, the main office, and next year we'll be cutting one for the Vogue.

2464
04:33:14,178 --> 04:33:21,341
So it will be two assistant principals also, because we're downgrading them too.

2465
04:33:22,942 --> 04:33:25,703
So I'd like you to reconsider that.

2466
04:33:26,383 --> 04:33:28,084
And we already have a floater.

2467
04:33:28,484 --> 04:33:30,585
So who would the first floater

2468
04:33:31,132 --> 04:33:35,274
Would the McGlynn School be pulled first, or would the other floor be pulled first?

2469
04:33:36,195 --> 04:33:37,055
That's one question.

2470
04:33:38,236 --> 04:33:58,366
And then, regarding the HR and payroll position, we already have the grants manager, Kate Moscos, I'm probably killing her name, but I'm sorry, the finance director, Mr. McHugh, accounting manager, Mr. Valles, and then HR, Mrs. Camuso.

2471
04:33:59,898 --> 04:34:22,773
Any payroll work has to fall under our union, unless you're hiring two more administrators, which is kind of over the top but I don't understand why we can't try to hide to save one of our secretaries, who makes 20,000 less than this $70,000 salary you want to give to two people.

2472
04:34:23,534 --> 04:34:27,116
So just by saving one secretary, you'd be saving 90,000.

2473
04:34:31,255 --> 04:34:36,678
Or, okay, HR, you would have HR, I understand that one, for underneath Jeanine.

2474
04:34:37,699 --> 04:34:53,247
But I'd really like you to take that into consideration, too, so we can save at least one more secretary, and we're already losing three, and then three are retiring, which wasn't really their choice to retire now, but had no choice.

2475
04:34:55,293 --> 04:34:58,896
I'm Mary Jo Petroni I'm the president of the administrative assistance union.

2476
04:34:59,476 --> 04:35:16,508
And as Michelle stated, we're very concerned, again, on the safety, and I'm even more concerned about the safety at Bedford High School eliminating an assistant principal administrative assistant, because I'm very fortunate I have a radio in my office, and on a daily basis.

2477
04:35:17,168 --> 04:35:24,011
They're calling, the assistant principals are calling their assistants and saying, I'm sending students to you, they need a break.

2478
04:35:24,331 --> 04:35:25,251
We're having an issue.

2479
04:35:25,291 --> 04:35:27,752
We had a fight at the high school on Friday.

2480
04:35:28,052 --> 04:35:29,593
We had to separate some students.

2481
04:35:30,033 --> 04:35:34,835
We need to make sure that the students know they have a safe place to go.

2482
04:35:35,375 --> 04:35:38,676
If you have nobody on the second floor as an administrative assistant,

2483
04:35:41,537 --> 04:36:04,249
only the third and the first one person is out now you have one administrative assistant covering the entire high school that's a scary thing to me and and students are very smart they recognize when there are people missing if there's an assistant principal out if there's a teacher out we have a lot of roamers and they're going to be much more roaming at that point

2484
04:36:05,287 --> 04:36:15,153
The McGlynn School is the big concern because that's younger students, much younger students, lot of parent concerns, and that's a big issue.

2485
04:36:15,553 --> 04:36:20,696
With regards to the payroll, I have to say this because I did work in payroll.

2486
04:36:20,856 --> 04:36:27,220
I was deployed to another department because they needed help in another department when we had the 2009, 10, 11 changes re-organization.

2487
04:36:31,386 --> 04:36:41,919
I did the MTRS report, and it was perfection until a person who we don't speak about anymore decided it shouldn't be done by me but he couldn't figure out who should do it.

2488
04:36:42,340 --> 04:36:43,421
So he dropped the ball.

2489
04:36:43,982 --> 04:36:46,885
I was fine doing the report until he said that.

2490
04:36:47,958 --> 04:36:53,843
I also feel like there's been a huge amount of changes in the way the finances are done.

2491
04:36:53,883 --> 04:36:56,506
We've had numerous finance directors.

2492
04:36:56,566 --> 04:37:06,475
So I'm hoping, and I think Mr. Rousseau does, that we finally get one way to do finances, because it's been done multiple different ways.

2493
04:37:06,695 --> 04:37:09,958
And it seems like Jerry has a much better handle on

2494
04:37:10,638 --> 04:37:18,964
finding the hidden monies and helping on buildings and grounds is a perfect example of a department that has to buy, it has to fix things no matter what.

2495
04:37:19,604 --> 04:37:30,452
So we just, he is able to approve our over budget POs with our request and allow us to keep the students in the safe positions that they are.

2496
04:37:30,892 --> 04:37:32,633
or repair the problems that we have.

2497
04:37:33,113 --> 04:37:43,597
So I do appreciate Jerry's, but I mean, I think a lot of our problem is the number of finance operators we've had in this district over the last 24 years that I've been here.

2498
04:37:44,457 --> 04:37:47,478
And the last thing is I did make a decision to retire.

2499
04:37:47,558 --> 04:37:57,042
They changed my job and for my own family, it makes more sense for me to leave, but I'm walking out the door with knowledge in my head, as are the other two people.

2500
04:37:57,762 --> 04:38:00,864
And also the administrators that are going to be walking out the door.

2501
04:38:01,464 --> 04:38:13,692
I hope you understand what you're losing with knowledge that these people are given, and a bad taste in their mouth, because it was not a very nice way that any of it was done.

2502
04:38:14,292 --> 04:38:17,935
So that being said, I'm just sharing that information on my end.

2503
04:38:18,575 --> 04:38:19,596
And with regards to Ms.

2504
04:38:19,636 --> 04:38:26,620
Rallo, today I was counting $12,000 she raised on the Mamma Mia play, because I also do student activities.

2505
04:38:27,161 --> 04:38:27,381
Ms.

2506
04:38:27,421 --> 04:38:31,103
Rallo has done an incredible job in the time that I've worked with her.

2507
04:38:31,504 --> 04:38:32,084
But Ms.

2508
04:38:32,164 --> 04:38:34,586
Fee is bringing in grant money like you wouldn't believe.

2509
04:38:34,646 --> 04:38:42,771
And if she's going to have a lot more work to do running a whole department, you're going to lose the ability to write those grants, to run those programs that she's running.

2510
04:38:42,811 --> 04:38:43,812
So please remember,

2511
04:38:44,452 --> 04:38:50,254
When you combine a job, you lose the ability to do extra things that they are both doing right now.

2512
04:38:50,734 --> 04:38:51,634
So I do thank you.

2513
04:38:51,694 --> 04:38:59,597
I appreciate what you're going through, but honestly, I think you're losing a lot more than staff, and that's a big problem.

2514
04:39:00,017 --> 04:39:00,577
Thank you.

2515
04:39:09,676 --> 04:39:11,998
My name is Enoch Liao, I live at 9 Earl Avenue.

2516
04:39:12,879 --> 04:39:16,902
Madam Mayor, Madam Superintendent, and the committee, thank you for being here.

2517
04:39:16,962 --> 04:39:19,104
Also, thanks for listening to us.

2518
04:39:19,284 --> 04:39:20,025
It's not easy.

2519
04:39:20,345 --> 04:39:22,747
These are not glamorous positions you plug your way into.

2520
04:39:22,767 --> 04:39:28,351
Medford is a wonderful city to live in, but it's a challenging district to attract and retain great talent.

2521
04:39:28,412 --> 04:39:30,834
And I think no one knows that better than you, Superintendent.

2522
04:39:31,514 --> 04:39:34,415
My wife and I moved from Los Angeles to come to serve.

2523
04:39:34,495 --> 04:39:38,416
I'm a pastor in this church, of a church that's in Boston in the city of Newton.

2524
04:39:38,836 --> 04:39:43,798
So I'm familiar with the Boston Public Schools and the Newton Public Schools, but all my three boys have grown up in Medford.

2525
04:39:44,558 --> 04:39:49,720
Three in the Roberts, two in McGlynn, one in Andrews, and two have gone through the high school.

2526
04:39:49,780 --> 04:39:51,160
One just graduated yesterday from Tufts.

2527
04:39:51,280 --> 04:39:52,401
The other one is also in Tufts.

2528
04:39:52,781 --> 04:39:56,762
And my other son is the one that's one of the two drum majors who's hoping for a season next year.

2529
04:39:57,884 --> 04:40:01,205
In terms of what we can say, I know you're making a lot of hard decisions.

2530
04:40:01,645 --> 04:40:12,869
So as I understand the situation, you've got lots of other folks that can tell you in greater detail, the emotions and the impact, and I know you weigh up each one, each person's story.

2531
04:40:13,349 --> 04:40:20,011
So what I can share a little differently would be to just, I can't advocate for the other groups either, because I don't have the privilege of being a parent of every

2532
04:40:20,796 --> 04:40:31,402
I feel like my kid does a lot, but in all those sports and teams and clubs and nurses, so I know you're making hard decisions and I do believe this committee and all the administration has poured over the budget to really try to figure out how we can make it work.

2533
04:40:31,962 --> 04:40:33,463
So I'm going to come with just a few angles.

2534
04:40:34,203 --> 04:40:38,706
Superintendent, I think respectfully, some folks may have a different perspective of the impact.

2535
04:40:39,346 --> 04:40:40,106
of losing Israel.

2536
04:40:40,586 --> 04:40:43,647
So I understand you're doing your best and so I appreciate that.

2537
04:40:44,007 --> 04:40:50,649
But I think if there's time to dialogue that's appropriate be happy to connect with that about those things but I do think there's a pretty big disconnect.

2538
04:40:51,289 --> 04:41:02,032
I know at the last committee meeting talked about like, you know, superintendent and committee members showing up I understand there's laws about that there's a lot of good reasons why superintendent committee members can't just walk all over the buildings they want so I appreciate that but

2539
04:41:02,652 --> 04:41:05,673
Oh, actually she can she can she can that's awesome.

2540
04:41:05,693 --> 04:41:29,001
But but all that's to say that I recognize it's a lot of people to take care of a lot of a lot of shoes to try to understand so I appreciate that but that being said, what I do know and my work as a pastor and in different agencies and cities, is you try to keep essential personnel, and there's two kinds of essential personnel, there's the high performers and, you know, we want that stays in your room as you discuss the, the realities of performance reviews.

2541
04:41:29,932 --> 04:41:36,376
And what they can bring to the city, making the best use of every city dollar to the best education of our city and our kids I understand that.

2542
04:41:36,716 --> 04:41:39,978
But then there's also an essential personnel that this without that person.

2543
04:41:40,818 --> 04:41:48,342
It really is a critical linchpin to the functioning of that program at the quality and level that we really want to see.

2544
04:41:48,963 --> 04:41:50,443
So that's the thing I would say appealing for.

2545
04:41:51,704 --> 04:42:05,547
Really, the creativity appreciate that to make it work I guess I'm just another voice to say, I actually think it'd be incredibly hard to hire someone to do the kind of commitment and work them Israel has I know school districts right now, that would salivate at the thought that she would be on the market.

2546
04:42:06,487 --> 04:42:13,589
So I know you know that but I guess, as you go back to make the hard decisions I am pleading with you to consider that to make those hard decisions with creativity.

2547
04:42:13,989 --> 04:42:41,867
Secondly, and just trying to add two things that haven't been said tonight, not because I need to be original but, and I didn't want it to get spicy but when I first came to the city hall for as a parent is probably in the middle school my oldest was orchestra, and the funny thing was the wonderful community members of which at that point we're all white had a hard time pronouncing all the names of the vastly diverse orchestra at that point, and I realized oh all the kids are not white kind of coalesce into some of these programs.

2548
04:42:43,058 --> 04:42:47,544
I haven't gone to every football game every basketball game every cheerleader competition.

2549
04:42:47,785 --> 04:42:53,813
I've done all those things but it seems to me that there's a potentially high concentration of people of color.

2550
04:42:54,861 --> 04:42:59,245
And I don't know for a fact, but LGBTQIA plus are in some of these programs.

2551
04:42:59,825 --> 04:43:10,334
And I, you know, we could do a study, you guys could commission it, but you might be inadvertently disproportionately impacting some of the few programs that actually, that's what I think they mean by the safe spaces.

2552
04:43:10,754 --> 04:43:19,582
So I guess whether that's a study you conduct or whether that's just another assessment, as you're making those hard choices to reprioritize that, I think these are one of the places where

2553
04:43:20,598 --> 04:43:25,559
My wife and I were the only, you know, our son was one of the only East Asians in the member schools when he was a kid.

2554
04:43:26,219 --> 04:43:28,880
You know, they said, like, look at all his friends, all diverse.

2555
04:43:28,960 --> 04:43:32,281
It's like a, I said, it's like a WB TV show sitcom cast.

2556
04:43:32,821 --> 04:43:34,061
But I said, they're not diverse.

2557
04:43:34,181 --> 04:43:37,622
And like, actually some of the parents of the class of 20, they disagree with me.

2558
04:43:37,662 --> 04:43:38,442
They look so diverse.

2559
04:43:38,462 --> 04:43:41,063
No, these are the non-white kids in their class.

2560
04:43:41,363 --> 04:43:43,824
They all hang out together, because at the time there are so few.

2561
04:43:44,764 --> 04:43:48,585
So I think whether there's so many great programs, so many great things, but in terms of the,

2562
04:43:49,645 --> 04:43:53,508
really trying to make Medford a welcoming city for all, that's something to consider.

2563
04:43:53,849 --> 04:43:59,213
The third and final thing is I want you to know that we do pray for you regularly and pray for you and your decisions.

2564
04:43:59,253 --> 04:44:02,095
So thank you for all that you're doing and just appreciate the work.

2565
04:44:02,596 --> 04:44:04,838
And we've only lived in Medford our entire time at St.

2566
04:44:04,858 --> 04:44:06,859
Jude's and we're really grateful the Lord brought us here.

2567
04:44:07,200 --> 04:44:07,740
Thank you for your time.

2568
04:44:07,980 --> 04:44:08,461
Thank you.

2569
04:44:08,481 --> 04:44:14,165
Can you name and address for the record?

2570
04:44:16,181 --> 04:44:20,702
I'm Maggie Fowler, 28 Wedgemere Road, and I am a junior at Medford High School.

2571
04:44:21,182 --> 04:44:33,586
So I know that so many points have been brought up tonight, and I don't want to run over anything that's already been said, but I feel like there is an aspect of this whole entire situation that we've been sort of missing.

2572
04:44:34,779 --> 04:44:51,523
And as a member of eight years of the Medford Performing Arts Department, I've been part of the marching band, I've been part of the Medford High School Orchestra, as well as the middle school orchestra, string ensemble, and elementary school orchestras.

2573
04:44:51,643 --> 04:44:56,125
And I've also been part of the drama club for every year that I've been in high school.

2574
04:44:57,105 --> 04:44:57,265
And

2575
04:44:58,075 --> 04:45:11,705
I would like to vouch for the fact that the removal of this performing arts coordinator position would trickle down into every single organization that falls under the performing arts umbrella.

2576
04:45:11,785 --> 04:45:27,437
And this includes the marching band, but as well as the drama club and the orchestra and the percussion groups that are a part of these and the winter guard and every single elementary and middle school group that reflects these organizations from the high school.

2577
04:45:27,967 --> 04:45:31,790
every single one of these organizations would be impacted by this removal.

2578
04:45:32,390 --> 04:45:48,881
And I've seen a lot of mention of the band, and I've seen a lot of mention of the drama club, but all of our organizations rely on Miss Rello's transportation management, her organization, and her communication between just the people of these organizations.

2579
04:45:49,682 --> 04:45:53,945
And these activities without her would be nearly impossible to run.

2580
04:45:55,236 --> 04:46:01,698
Because of this, I strongly advise a reconsideration of these position cuts.

2581
04:46:02,038 --> 04:46:03,559
Thank you.

2582
04:46:11,908 --> 04:46:17,271
So me personally, I started out as a kid who went to another school in another city.

2583
04:46:17,451 --> 04:46:23,013
I had no idea what band was until I got a little older and then realized my sisters are in this.

2584
04:46:23,633 --> 04:46:26,395
My sisters are creating a legacy and they left behind for me.

2585
04:46:27,175 --> 04:46:30,276
And when I came into band, I've been here for two years.

2586
04:46:31,057 --> 04:46:36,199
And then I was like, I don't want to be known as my sister's brother.

2587
04:46:36,479 --> 04:46:38,220
I want to make my own legacy.

2588
04:46:39,040 --> 04:46:40,121
I want to leave a mark here.

2589
04:46:42,452 --> 04:46:46,373
Like, I wanna be here for everybody.

2590
04:46:47,053 --> 04:46:47,693
I wanna help.

2591
04:46:48,574 --> 04:46:59,296
Like, division is like, when you take away the arts, when you break it up, or like, when you give it to one person.

2592
04:46:59,716 --> 04:47:00,236
Think of Ms.

2593
04:47:00,276 --> 04:47:00,557
Fee.

2594
04:47:00,717 --> 04:47:00,977
Ms.

2595
04:47:01,057 --> 04:47:02,417
Fee is like,

2596
04:47:02,813 --> 04:47:07,455
Think of her, she has to do so much more if you're giving all that to her or that whoever's next.

2597
04:47:08,016 --> 04:47:10,677
It's not gonna be one person with all that stress.

2598
04:47:11,237 --> 04:47:14,619
And then you have like, think of it like a train.

2599
04:47:14,939 --> 04:47:17,340
Miss Rella's the couplers that hold the train carts together.

2600
04:47:17,800 --> 04:47:26,685
If you take the couplers out, you take Miss Rella out, the train, which is the band or the entire department, it falls apart and then it could crash.

2601
04:47:27,505 --> 04:47:28,686
Crash and like,

2602
04:47:29,687 --> 04:47:33,930
pray for everything to burn.

2603
04:47:35,190 --> 04:47:41,174
If you take the most important component, nothing will work properly.

2604
04:47:43,035 --> 04:47:43,396
Thank you.

2605
04:47:43,776 --> 04:47:44,236
Thank you.

2606
04:47:44,256 --> 04:47:52,161
Is your name and address for the record?

2607
04:47:52,702 --> 04:47:56,324
My name is Gavin Gagne, often mispronounced as Gagne.

2608
04:47:59,196 --> 04:47:59,856
I never did.

2609
04:48:01,957 --> 04:48:05,279
Unfortunately, I really don't have much to say.

2610
04:48:05,299 --> 04:48:10,862
I kind of only joined two friends here for the ride, as I usually do, really.

2611
04:48:13,403 --> 04:48:15,864
But since I'm up here, I might as well have something to say.

2612
04:48:16,945 --> 04:48:24,388
So I have this quote from a guitarist that I look up to, which is ironic since I myself am a drummer.

2613
04:48:25,549 --> 04:48:26,529
I'm a bit more than that.

2614
04:48:29,039 --> 04:48:31,841
The quote is, music is our friend.

2615
04:48:33,042 --> 04:48:42,089
And that was said by Robert Fripp, who's a member of a band that I really admire called King Crimson.

2616
04:48:42,889 --> 04:48:48,073
Not like that information is relevant or anything, but I particularly like that quote.

2617
04:48:51,516 --> 04:48:58,741
because I feel like we all can agree in the band on the fact that music is our friend.

2618
04:48:59,802 --> 04:49:06,546
And for most of us, it's all that we have really.

2619
04:49:06,566 --> 04:49:13,030
And if you take that, if you take away that position, what was it again?

2620
04:49:13,491 --> 04:49:18,054
The Director of, Coordinator of Performing Arts.

2621
04:49:18,094 --> 04:49:18,954
If you take that away,

2622
04:49:20,063 --> 04:49:27,325
you're probably going to be taking away what is pretty much all we have.

2623
04:49:27,505 --> 04:49:41,187
I mean, sure, we can connect with music some other way, but it won't be the same as with a group of people, which is what I personally am grateful for.

2624
04:49:43,688 --> 04:49:47,149
I do not know where else to go with this, so I'm just gonna leave it here.

2625
04:49:47,169 --> 04:49:47,829
Thank you.

2626
04:49:53,414 --> 04:49:58,077
My name and address for the record.

2627
04:49:58,117 --> 04:50:00,018
Colby Robbins, 37 Hicks Ave.

2628
04:50:00,358 --> 04:50:02,940
I'm the librarian at the Missituck.

2629
04:50:03,760 --> 04:50:07,482
I just wanna quickly echo what my colleagues have said about cutting the Missituck positions.

2630
04:50:07,682 --> 04:50:18,469
I do think it would be a great disservice, but I would also remiss if I didn't talk about another position that is being cut, and that is the director of technology and libraries.

2631
04:50:19,369 --> 04:50:22,752
Molly does an incredible job at what she does.

2632
04:50:23,333 --> 04:50:27,377
She has cultivated devotion within her staff.

2633
04:50:28,378 --> 04:50:30,740
I can speak of nothing but good things about Molly.

2634
04:50:32,662 --> 04:50:40,530
She has advocated for the library in a way that I have not seen anyone else do in this administration.

2635
04:50:42,895 --> 04:50:54,387
The library provides such an amazing resource and safe space for our kids that to get rid of that position and just lump it somewhere else takes away all of that.

2636
04:50:55,588 --> 04:51:00,733
So I really hope that you take that into consideration when you look at these cuts.

2637
04:51:01,991 --> 04:51:04,452
You know, it's not just a position.

2638
04:51:05,192 --> 04:51:12,853
You know, she's an advocator for not just her staff, but all of these students from kindergarten all the way up to 12th grade.

2639
04:51:14,834 --> 04:51:27,176
And we also mentioned on the technology side, all of our Chromebooks that were bought in COVID are getting to the end of their life cycle, which means somebody needs to focus on repurchasing, replacing,

2640
04:51:28,345 --> 04:51:35,950
all of that, and heading up tech support, which provides vital, vital support to our students.

2641
04:51:36,190 --> 04:51:42,914
I can't count how many times a day I have students coming into the library going, Mr. Robbins, my Chromebook's broken, can you fix it?

2642
04:51:42,934 --> 04:51:44,615
And they go, I am teaching a class.

2643
04:51:45,335 --> 04:51:48,357
I will try to get to it when I can, but I don't have the time right now.

2644
04:51:49,758 --> 04:51:54,121
So we really need somebody in that position to guide that.

2645
04:51:55,001 --> 04:51:56,102
That's really all I have to say.

2646
04:51:56,582 --> 04:51:56,782
Thank you.

2647
04:52:03,094 --> 04:52:05,916
Good evening, Jessica Bruno, Saunders Street.

2648
04:52:07,157 --> 04:52:12,061
I'm here tonight to advocate for the performing arts and specifically for Mrs. Swallow.

2649
04:52:12,181 --> 04:52:17,265
I emailed several of you and did not receive responses from most of you.

2650
04:52:17,705 --> 04:52:28,773
So I'm going to not bore you with my long, lengthy address, but I'm gonna just read one excerpt because I only heard one other parent mention this group, but just please bear with me.

2651
04:52:28,793 --> 04:52:31,516
Another point that I wanna bring to your attention is,

2652
04:52:32,797 --> 04:52:37,901
Two is the educational exclusion this cut will have on a subset of the student body.

2653
04:52:38,361 --> 04:52:41,123
Let's be honest, not all students are athletes.

2654
04:52:41,764 --> 04:52:50,771
Some students can't participate in sports due to disabilities and have physical limitations, and others who may be neurodivergent can't do to do.

2655
04:52:52,072 --> 04:52:54,535
to cognitive and developmental limitations.

2656
04:52:54,796 --> 04:52:59,461
So eliminating a program accessible to all abilities is discriminatory.

2657
04:52:59,782 --> 04:53:09,294
Research shows that neurodivergent people excel creatively and inclusive programs such as those overseen by Mrs. Rallo positively affect peer relationships

2658
04:53:09,694 --> 04:53:13,016
social, emotional health, and incentivize good behavior.

2659
04:53:13,517 --> 04:53:26,906
In addition to the disabled and neurodivergent populations, research also shows more LGBTQ students participate in sports at a much lower rate than their non-LGBTQ peers.

2660
04:53:27,386 --> 04:53:33,931
And of those LGBTQ students, performing arts have proven to be a safe haven for those youth.

2661
04:53:34,471 --> 04:53:46,756
Robust performing arts programs like the current NPS performing arts program led by Mrs well have been shown to empower youth improve mental health and well being and create a sense of belonging and inclusiveness.

2662
04:53:47,076 --> 04:53:51,718
So I please urge you to find the funding reallocate fundings.

2663
04:53:56,120 --> 04:54:04,345
look into the override and just support the Medford youth and continue on with this program because these stipends are not gonna cut it.

2664
04:54:05,006 --> 04:54:25,039
Let's be real, we saw how many hours go into a program like this, how many elementary and middle school students are rising up and have taken on orchestra band and are promoting into the high school without these programs in place, it's not gonna empower our youth for the next generation.

2665
04:54:25,519 --> 04:54:25,939
Thank you.

2666
04:54:26,120 --> 04:54:26,560
Thank you.

2667
04:54:26,580 --> 04:54:36,726
We do have a couple of folks who've been waiting very patiently on zoom so is it Chris Bennett.

2668
04:54:41,069 --> 04:54:41,309
Yes.

2669
04:54:42,965 --> 04:54:45,026
Good evening and thank you for being patient.

2670
04:54:46,067 --> 04:54:47,948
I have a couple of concerns.

2671
04:54:48,249 --> 04:55:01,217
One of my, the biggest issue that I'm finding is that we're defining cuts from the number of students rather than the raw data from DOE, which breaks down diversity, special needs in an identified therapeutic school.

2672
04:55:02,310 --> 04:55:07,214
So by eliminating that type of information, it's just blowing my mind.

2673
04:55:07,694 --> 04:55:15,139
I'm looking at the data from DOE, and I'm looking at the McGlynn specifically right now, which is the most diverse.

2674
04:55:16,220 --> 04:55:21,123
It's got the most high needs, 71.34%, most ELL.

2675
04:55:21,664 --> 04:55:27,408
You have 64 incoming kindergarten students, and you have students with disabilities that are 15%.

2676
04:55:28,649 --> 04:55:31,050
Now, although the MSITUC is considered

2677
04:55:32,668 --> 04:55:49,836
less amount of students, we have, we're at 33.24% of non-English or English not as their first language, 22% of students with disabilities and 57% with high needs.

2678
04:55:50,776 --> 04:55:54,878
They have the lowest MCAS scores in our city.

2679
04:55:56,479 --> 04:56:00,841
Now the Brooks, although they have a high percentage of students,

2680
04:56:02,011 --> 04:56:04,154
They have the highest MCAS scores.

2681
04:56:04,714 --> 04:56:07,858
They are the least diverse of all of the schools.

2682
04:56:08,559 --> 04:56:11,122
We came from 11 elementary schools.

2683
04:56:11,362 --> 04:56:11,843
I'm old.

2684
04:56:13,084 --> 04:56:16,128
I have four children who went through Medford Public Schools.

2685
04:56:16,969 --> 04:56:18,631
I have four grandchildren.

2686
04:56:19,864 --> 04:56:27,428
I'm seeing that Medford that had 11 elementary schools, we watched maintenance get cut, cut, cut.

2687
04:56:27,508 --> 04:56:30,610
So the schools weren't even able to be replenished.

2688
04:56:31,050 --> 04:56:34,131
We've gone down to a total of four.

2689
04:56:34,932 --> 04:56:36,993
We have two middle schools and one high school.

2690
04:56:39,562 --> 04:56:49,127
Okay, so now we're looking at cuts on specifics on how many students per school, which is what's giving them the ability to break down.

2691
04:56:49,548 --> 04:56:52,289
I'm also an advocate for children with special needs.

2692
04:56:53,010 --> 04:56:54,951
I've placed a lot of children

2693
04:56:56,218 --> 04:57:05,120
with the school system to the Missittuck School because they were the most able to handle the therapeutic needs of a lot of these kids.

2694
04:57:05,200 --> 04:57:15,141
Some of them had autism, some of them had other areas that had concerns, and all of the school worked together, which is why it's a therapeutic school.

2695
04:57:15,601 --> 04:57:18,302
Everybody worked together to work with all of these children.

2696
04:57:19,402 --> 04:57:24,663
Now, if we have to think out of the box, maybe we need to make it that all schools

2697
04:57:25,894 --> 04:57:34,398
are thrown together and the kids get to go whatever school that they were assigned instead of everybody going to one particular school.

2698
04:57:35,459 --> 04:57:38,880
So everybody wants to get into the Brooks because they have great MCAS scores.

2699
04:57:39,601 --> 04:57:41,361
What about all the kids that have special needs?

2700
04:57:41,401 --> 04:57:42,282
They don't make it there.

2701
04:57:42,902 --> 04:57:43,502
You know why?

2702
04:57:43,642 --> 04:57:46,204
Because the class sizes are kind of big.

2703
04:57:46,684 --> 04:57:48,645
It's not really tolerated as easily over there.

2704
04:57:49,767 --> 04:57:51,770
All of the kids are tolerated at the Mississippi.

2705
04:57:52,031 --> 04:57:55,816
We have a lot of kids that don't speak English or they're English language learners.

2706
04:57:56,778 --> 04:57:59,101
And all of a sudden, we're going to start cutting.

2707
04:57:59,822 --> 04:58:02,126
So how are we going to implement those students?

2708
04:58:02,842 --> 04:58:05,224
going into the regular education classes.

2709
04:58:05,704 --> 04:58:08,046
They're supposed to be in the least restrictive environment.

2710
04:58:08,626 --> 04:58:16,611
If a child shows the ability to be able to access the standard curriculum with support, they should be allowed to be doing that.

2711
04:58:17,112 --> 04:58:22,315
If you have 22 kids in there, or 23 or 24, we're going backwards.

2712
04:58:22,816 --> 04:58:25,317
That's the kind of stuff that went on in the 80s and 90s.

2713
04:58:27,398 --> 04:58:29,699
If we are talking about doing fair.

2714
04:58:30,440 --> 04:58:33,802
Watch, but I just wanted to remind you that you have three minutes.

2715
04:58:33,982 --> 04:58:38,264
Okay, if we're gonna be fair, then we need to make sure that we are equitable.

2716
04:58:38,804 --> 04:58:41,586
Right now, we are not.

2717
04:58:42,366 --> 04:58:43,947
We're not equitable at all.

2718
04:58:44,607 --> 04:58:47,789
I'm looking at the numbers that are from the Department of Education.

2719
04:58:47,929 --> 04:58:52,872
I encourage all of the school committee members to really, really pull that apart to see that.

2720
04:58:54,132 --> 04:58:55,133
We're in trouble.

2721
04:58:56,343 --> 04:58:59,625
We need to make sure legally they're in the least restrictive environment.

2722
04:59:00,225 --> 04:59:03,187
We need to legally make sure that they have an appropriate supports.

2723
04:59:03,787 --> 04:59:12,852
We legally have to make sure that those students who were supposed to be receiving services are getting the services and those service providers are not taking care of another class.

2724
04:59:13,653 --> 04:59:20,417
So I'm looking at the legal issues of this and how difficult this is going to be if we don't resolve this.

2725
04:59:21,417 --> 04:59:30,883
Maybe we need to start from scratch and put all of the schools together in a big jumping pot, because a lot of people that are in walking distance to the Brooks School have to go to the Mississippi.

2726
04:59:31,903 --> 04:59:33,524
So we got to figure that out.

2727
04:59:33,784 --> 04:59:35,585
It's just wrong what's happening right now.

2728
04:59:35,905 --> 04:59:39,327
We are not diverse in our schools at all.

2729
04:59:48,996 --> 04:59:51,118
Hi, Jessica Haley full off road method.

2730
04:59:52,158 --> 04:59:55,641
Um, so I just have a few things, few questions, few statements.

2731
04:59:56,762 --> 05:00:03,047
Um, when we're talking about the budget, two things come to mind.

2732
05:00:03,067 --> 05:00:11,393
Um, I know the school committee got their raise, not sure how much is being taken out of the budget for that.

2733
05:00:12,392 --> 05:00:16,313
And also we are now paying three doctorate salaries.

2734
05:00:16,913 --> 05:00:21,834
Our superintendent and two superintendents are now both doctorate salaries.

2735
05:00:22,274 --> 05:00:32,096
So I'm wondering how much with the school committee raise and now three doctorates in the administration, how much is coming out of just those salaries?

2736
05:00:33,817 --> 05:00:39,898
Also cutting nurses, cutting secretaries, adjustment counselors,

2737
05:00:40,950 --> 05:00:43,571
Those are the three people that my son goes to.

2738
05:00:44,972 --> 05:00:48,034
He's on an IEP, suffers from anxiety.

2739
05:00:49,234 --> 05:00:57,239
And when he's having an issue, which happens not too often, but he definitely needs it sometimes, they send him to the nurse.

2740
05:00:58,279 --> 05:01:00,000
They send him to the adjustment counselor.

2741
05:01:00,360 --> 05:01:03,202
So they'll send him to the office to sit with the secretary.

2742
05:01:04,463 --> 05:01:06,864
And those are the people that we think we can get rid of.

2743
05:01:08,208 --> 05:01:15,533
My son's going to the middle school, the McLean, and you're telling me that we're gonna have one adjustment counselor for all those kids?

2744
05:01:17,954 --> 05:01:20,296
Hardly any secretaries, nurses.

2745
05:01:20,976 --> 05:01:22,897
So where's my son gonna go when he needs the help?

2746
05:01:23,898 --> 05:01:24,638
Because he'll need it.

2747
05:01:24,658 --> 05:01:26,760
It's not middle school.

2748
05:01:30,842 --> 05:01:34,785
Also, we're using Nexus as a form of mental health.

2749
05:01:35,748 --> 05:01:40,609
I want to know, does any of these Nexus teachers have mental health credentials?

2750
05:01:42,589 --> 05:01:53,671
Or are we just saying that Nexus is helping kids with mental health, but all these adjustment counselors are, what kind of degrees do they have in mental health?

2751
05:01:58,692 --> 05:02:02,993
Also with the arts, I think my son will kind of thrive in the arts as he gets older.

2752
05:02:06,004 --> 05:02:10,748
with him having different disabilities, I think that would be a good place for him to go.

2753
05:02:11,909 --> 05:02:28,462
Granted, I don't know much about it yet, as he's only hitting sixth grade, he hasn't been really into it yet, but I think that getting rid of the arts directors, obviously you're hearing all the children, they need that lady and they rely on her.

2754
05:02:30,604 --> 05:02:35,568
So I would like to say to the mayor, we have,

2755
05:02:36,243 --> 05:02:39,525
the money in the extra cash, which is technically our money.

2756
05:02:40,825 --> 05:02:43,006
And I think we should have a say of where it goes.

2757
05:02:44,727 --> 05:02:47,268
I know everyone's talking about the 2.5 override.

2758
05:02:47,589 --> 05:02:49,029
Well, right now we don't have that.

2759
05:02:49,970 --> 05:02:51,791
But what we do have is the extra cash.

2760
05:02:52,831 --> 05:03:01,796
And what we need to do is keep our secretaries, keep our nurses, keep our guidance counselors, keep the arts program.

2761
05:03:03,116 --> 05:03:04,437
We need this for our children.

2762
05:03:06,172 --> 05:03:12,657
They are not someone that can come in second and let's just figure out the money because you know what?

2763
05:03:13,257 --> 05:03:16,860
All the administrators, the school committee, everyone's getting their money.

2764
05:03:18,141 --> 05:03:24,426
But the people who are really working with these kids day in and day out, those are the people you want to help.

2765
05:03:25,106 --> 05:03:27,368
I hope you finished my time.

2766
05:03:28,538 --> 05:03:36,903
Okay, so I, I'll email to get some of these responses because I know I said a lot, you're not going to remember it all.

2767
05:03:37,964 --> 05:03:38,604
Thank you, Jessica.

2768
05:03:38,885 --> 05:03:40,526
Thank you for taking it into consideration.

2769
05:03:40,746 --> 05:03:41,146
Thank you.

2770
05:03:48,051 --> 05:03:51,354
Hi, I know you guys are all very tired and probably want to go home.

2771
05:03:51,755 --> 05:03:53,636
Um, I'm Amanda gas.

2772
05:03:53,716 --> 05:03:56,119
I teach at the Roberts elementary school.

2773
05:03:56,579 --> 05:03:58,441
This is my 14th year teaching.

2774
05:03:58,841 --> 05:04:13,054
Um, and I wanted to commend everyone who's spoken tonight because, um, it's, I feel like people have been very eloquent and really stood up for, um, the things that they believe in.

2775
05:04:14,475 --> 05:04:30,264
I am a kindergarten teacher, so I wanted to call attention to the additional kindergarten classrooms that are not being provided with teachers for next year.

2776
05:04:30,284 --> 05:04:39,069
And I know that that's based on enrollment, but I wanted to call your attention to it so that you can keep an eye on it.

2777
05:04:39,129 --> 05:04:42,250
Because what happened last year was that we

2778
05:04:43,531 --> 05:04:57,971
Um, lost a good teacher and ended up having to scramble to hire new teachers at all the elementary schools for additional kindergarten classrooms because of enrollment and especially at the Roberts.

2779
05:04:58,172 --> 05:04:59,634
I know it's true at other schools as.

2780
05:05:01,636 --> 05:05:08,683
But we have students who enroll way past now, right?

2781
05:05:08,743 --> 05:05:13,407
They're enrolling in August, even in September, but definitely throughout the summer.

2782
05:05:14,648 --> 05:05:20,374
And I just think that we should look at the trends in enrollment in the different schools.

2783
05:05:20,954 --> 05:05:37,089
and make sure that we're prepared because we have an excellent new teacher teaching at the Robertson Kindergarten, and I would hate to lose her and be scrambling to hire someone again in the fall.

2784
05:05:37,550 --> 05:05:38,290
Kindergarten is

2785
05:05:39,111 --> 05:05:54,400
anyone who has stepped foot in a kindergarten classroom knows that we really need good teachers, that these kids need the support, and that if you are talking about having four classrooms, if you're talking about having

2786
05:06:11,209 --> 05:06:12,029
Thank you miss gas.

2787
05:06:12,049 --> 05:06:12,330
Hello.

2788
05:06:13,070 --> 05:06:15,831
Can you hear me.

2789
05:06:30,842 --> 05:06:31,302
Yes, we can.

2790
05:06:31,322 --> 05:06:33,204
Can you name and address for the record, please?

2791
05:06:33,644 --> 05:06:36,987
Lucille Mello, East Border Circle in Medford.

2792
05:06:37,468 --> 05:06:52,660
I've just been watching this all night, and I normally don't say too much, but as a former educator in Medford and whose child has gone to Medford, I'm a little disappointed about a lot of these cuts.

2793
05:06:52,720 --> 05:06:58,725
And I just think right now that we should keep these cuts, use that rainy day fund,

2794
05:06:59,471 --> 05:07:06,013
then work on the prop two and a half, because the only people who are losing out are our schools and our students.

2795
05:07:06,633 --> 05:07:17,736
And just to add, my daughter did all her band and music in elementary school and in Medford High School, and the band was good, but it's even been better now.

2796
05:07:18,096 --> 05:07:21,217
And she used that to get into college, okay?

2797
05:07:21,497 --> 05:07:26,718
And she was in one of the largest well-known marching bands in this country.

2798
05:07:27,118 --> 05:07:28,959
And it all started in Medford High School.

2799
05:07:29,392 --> 05:07:35,436
And some people, as a prior speaker said, was some kids are not into sports and athletics.

2800
05:07:35,756 --> 05:07:38,558
My daughter did do sports, but she wasn't the best.

2801
05:07:38,978 --> 05:07:40,499
Music was where she thrived.

2802
05:07:40,819 --> 05:07:53,167
And I just think that so many kids, and as a former special ed teacher, I've had students who music was their thing, be it violin, be it flute, be it whatever, and they found their place in their home.

2803
05:07:53,547 --> 05:07:58,270
So I'm just giving my two cents that we just need to right now, that rainy day fund,

2804
05:07:58,928 --> 05:08:00,009
is there for a purpose.

2805
05:08:00,349 --> 05:08:16,964
Yes, we don't wanna use it all the time, but use it this year and then work on that two and a half thing because there are also places in this city where money is also mismanaged and spent and not at the expense of our school and our students and our community.

2806
05:08:17,224 --> 05:08:18,505
And that's where it needs to go.

2807
05:08:18,886 --> 05:08:19,947
So thank you very much.

2808
05:08:20,027 --> 05:08:22,789
And I appreciate all your time and effort for everybody there.

2809
05:08:23,189 --> 05:08:23,550
Thank you.

2810
05:08:23,570 --> 05:08:25,351
Thank you, Lucille.

2811
05:08:29,695 --> 05:08:33,538
Could you please put the spreadsheet back up on the screen.

2812
05:08:34,139 --> 05:08:36,420
And so could you please repeat your motion.

2813
05:08:38,462 --> 05:08:41,124
Remember it.

2814
05:08:45,047 --> 05:08:49,390
The motion was the member school committee budget request in the amount of $79,399,774 for the

2815
05:08:53,826 --> 05:09:05,176
responsible operations of the member public schools in 2024 2025 be submitted in writing to the member city council and the mayor of Medford within 48 hours of this motion, it was.

2816
05:09:06,117 --> 05:09:08,399
I made the motion of a second if I remember all the party.

2817
05:09:12,759 --> 05:09:18,083
point of clarification, is this number with all the cuts or without the cuts?

2818
05:09:18,264 --> 05:09:20,445
There are no cuts in this number.

2819
05:09:20,465 --> 05:09:26,851
So this number that we're putting forward is a request to the municipal government.

2820
05:09:27,031 --> 05:09:28,332
Yes, it's just a request.

2821
05:09:28,372 --> 05:09:29,713
That's all it is right now, guys.

2822
05:09:29,773 --> 05:09:31,715
It's a request, but it is the first step.

2823
05:09:33,516 --> 05:09:41,061
What I should clarify in my clarification is, is this number, because I'm getting confused with the language again, I'm on the job.

2824
05:09:42,362 --> 05:09:49,306
Is this number one that reflects the cuts in our packet or is this one that is the level one that is?

2825
05:09:49,526 --> 05:09:50,767
This is level service.

2826
05:09:50,847 --> 05:09:51,768
This is level service.

2827
05:09:51,788 --> 05:09:55,671
If we do not, so this does not include the cutting of the director of performing arts.

2828
05:09:55,751 --> 05:09:56,471
Correct.

2829
05:09:56,751 --> 05:09:57,692
That's all I would.

2830
05:09:58,012 --> 05:09:58,872
Yes, thank you very much.

2831
05:09:58,932 --> 05:10:00,293
Okay.

2832
05:10:01,213 --> 05:10:05,674
It's very important to know what we vote on.

2833
05:10:05,754 --> 05:10:07,734
Everyone else understands what we're voting.

2834
05:10:07,854 --> 05:10:08,054
Yes.

2835
05:10:08,134 --> 05:10:11,075
I do not feel comfortable voting on a budget that has this many cuts.

2836
05:10:11,115 --> 05:10:16,116
But if this number that we are putting forward, then yes, the bottom number, not the top number.

2837
05:10:16,156 --> 05:10:16,356
Yes.

2838
05:10:16,976 --> 05:10:18,276
Voting on the bottom involved.

2839
05:10:18,336 --> 05:10:18,597
Correct.

2840
05:10:19,457 --> 05:10:20,077
Member Brantley.

2841
05:10:20,157 --> 05:10:20,337
Yes.

2842
05:10:23,803 --> 05:10:23,883
Yes.

2843
05:10:23,903 --> 05:10:23,963
Yes.

2844
05:10:24,043 --> 05:10:24,223
Yes.

2845
05:10:24,344 --> 05:10:24,604
Yes.

2846
05:10:25,365 --> 05:10:25,465
Yes.

2847
05:10:25,485 --> 05:10:25,565
Yes.

2848
05:10:25,585 --> 05:10:25,665
Yes.

2849
05:10:25,765 --> 05:10:26,005
Yes.

2850
05:10:26,045 --> 05:10:26,266
Yes.

2851
05:10:46,212 --> 05:10:49,493
I'm sorry six in the affirmative, one abstention.

2852
05:10:49,513 --> 05:11:00,876
I requested the municipal government is a level service budget, which also includes for literacy interventionist for parabehavior specialists for a grand total of $79,399,774 motion passes.

2853
05:11:17,030 --> 05:11:19,280
And we're going to move on here.

2854
05:11:19,300 --> 05:11:19,702
It is.

2855
05:11:21,449 --> 05:11:22,149
11 past 10.

2856
05:11:23,710 --> 05:11:25,930
We don't have any presentations of the public tonight.

2857
05:11:25,950 --> 05:11:31,672
Item number, I can't count the number of emails anymore, seven, thank you.

2858
05:11:33,012 --> 05:11:37,234
Continued businesses and MSBA update, and is there a motion to table that?

2859
05:11:37,734 --> 05:11:38,774
Oh, motion to table.

2860
05:11:38,994 --> 05:11:44,135
Motion to table by member Rousseau, seconded by member Lopate, and everybody, all those in favor?

2861
05:11:44,155 --> 05:11:44,236
Aye.

2862
05:11:44,256 --> 05:11:44,856
All those opposed?

2863
05:11:44,876 --> 05:11:46,736
Good afternoon, thank you for taking the time.

2864
05:11:53,874 --> 05:11:54,675
Can you turn on your mic?

2865
05:11:54,935 --> 05:11:56,016
Yes, thank you so much.

2866
05:11:56,897 --> 05:12:04,063
So point of clarification for the fifth time, recommendation on the consent agenda, we did not vote to recommend to approve the $3,000 grant.

2867
05:12:04,743 --> 05:12:06,085
It was in the consent agenda.

2868
05:12:06,165 --> 05:12:09,488
We motioned to approve the consent agenda and it was unanimously approved.

2869
05:12:10,148 --> 05:12:10,829
So we're all set there.

2870
05:12:13,669 --> 05:12:16,190
There is no new business and no reports requested.

2871
05:12:16,210 --> 05:12:18,672
We do have a number of condolences.

2872
05:12:19,652 --> 05:12:30,899
Members of the Medford School Committee express their sincerest condolences to the family of Danny DiGiacomo, Jr., father of Denise Greco, McGlynn paraprofessional and afterschool program assistant.

2873
05:12:31,519 --> 05:12:38,924
Members of the Medford School Committee express their sincerest condolences to the family of Robert J. Brophy, brother of Medford High School history teacher Matthew Brophy.

2874
05:12:39,824 --> 05:12:50,556
The members of the Medford School Committee express their sincerest condolences to the family of Paul Arnold Polini, father of Emily Polini, an EO assessment specialist and lead teacher.

2875
05:12:50,877 --> 05:12:52,459
If we could all rise for a moment of silence.

2876
05:13:07,924 --> 05:13:14,966
Our next regular meeting is on June 3 2024 here in Alden Memorial Chambers Medford City Hall in addition to zoom.

2877
05:13:14,986 --> 05:13:18,987
I hope you all join us again soon for happier times.

2878
05:13:19,707 --> 05:13:25,209
And I want to say a special thank you to all the students that we celebrated at the beginning of tonight.

2879
05:13:26,890 --> 05:13:34,252
I was really worried about asking people to come to this meeting to be celebrated because it wasn't going to be a fun meeting but honestly it was what I needed.

2880
05:13:35,692 --> 05:13:38,057
to make it to 10pm so thank you.
