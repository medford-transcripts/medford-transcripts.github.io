[SPEAKER_04]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

20

[SPEAKER_07]: Chair recognizes Councilor Camuso.

21
00:00:52,701 --> 00:00:53,541
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

22
00:00:53,561 --> 00:00:56,623
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd like to make a motion to take paper

23
00:01:00,148 --> 00:01:04,351
[SPEAKER_15]: 15-460 off the table and refer it to Committee of the Whole.

[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Councilor Camuso to take Chapter 15-460 off the table.

00:01:11,717 --> 00:01:12,418

[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Councilor Camuso to send it to the Committee of the Whole.

29
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:16,981

30
00:01:17,001 --> 00:01:17,682

[SPEAKER_07]: It was sent to Committee of the Whole.

32
00:01:20,964 --> 00:01:24,127
[SPEAKER_07]: While we're under suspension, Councilor, Vice President, Lungo-Koehn.

33
00:01:24,887 --> 00:01:25,728
[SPEAKER_09]: If we can take

34
00:01:27,649 --> 00:01:31,030
[SPEAKER_09]: Paper one, under motions, orders, and resolutions, paper 15-497.

35
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:35,111
[SPEAKER_09]: Out of order, please.

36
00:01:35,811 --> 00:01:41,132
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Vice President Logan Kern to take 15-497 out of order.

00:01:41,172 --> 00:01:42,133
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

38
00:01:42,233 --> 00:01:43,313
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

39
00:01:43,793 --> 00:01:44,813
[SPEAKER_07]: The motion carries.

40
00:01:45,353 --> 00:01:48,894
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk, please mark Councilor Knight as present.

41
00:01:48,914 --> 00:01:49,735
[SPEAKER_07]: Not as president.

42
00:01:51,457 --> 00:01:51,777
[SPEAKER_07]: present.

43
00:01:52,758 --> 00:01:57,840
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, 15 for 97 offered by vice president Longo current and Councilor Marks.

44
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:18,630
[SPEAKER_07]: Be it resolved that the Medford city council request that the city administration report back to the council with regards to what, if anything has been done regarding the flight patterns from Logan airport, be it further resolved that Massport representative, uh, with Medford's appointment to the Massport community advisory board appeared before the Medford city council.

45
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:24,982
[SPEAKER_07]: Madam Vice President, is any of this related to the buzzing of method we've had from the Blue Angels today?

46
00:02:25,162 --> 00:02:26,102
[SPEAKER_09]: No, not today.

47
00:02:27,323 --> 00:02:28,784
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

48
00:02:29,685 --> 00:02:42,953
[SPEAKER_09]: Myself and actually Council Marks put this on the agenda because the entire council, I believe, has been getting a number of complaints from residents who are hearing the airplanes coming from Logan Airport.

49
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:46,260
[SPEAKER_09]: above their heads, whether their windows are open or not.

50
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,941
[SPEAKER_09]: It's disturbing sleep.

51
00:02:48,021 --> 00:02:49,922
[SPEAKER_09]: It's disturbing quality of life.

52
00:02:49,942 --> 00:02:52,023
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of it's going on.

53
00:02:52,063 --> 00:02:55,804
[SPEAKER_09]: I hear complaints from West Medford and from the Medford Heights.

54
00:02:56,645 --> 00:02:59,466
[SPEAKER_09]: And we actually have a resident here to speak tonight.

55
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:05,869
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would like her to come up and explain what's going on in her neighborhood, which is actually close to my neighborhood.

56
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:08,310
[SPEAKER_09]: I also wanted to bring it up.

57
00:03:09,338 --> 00:03:12,019
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it is hard to get answers from Massport.

58
00:03:12,179 --> 00:03:17,301
[SPEAKER_09]: It's hard to know exactly what our administration is doing with regards to these complaints.

59
00:03:17,761 --> 00:03:33,607
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the people need answers, and I think we need, whether it's a number of studies that can be done, analysis, analyzing the situation to make sure that we try to get some resolve for our residents.

60
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,520
[SPEAKER_09]: brought up the issue recently.

61
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:44,462
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, May 7th is the article that I read from Somerville, actually forwarded to me by somebody else who was complaining in the West Medford area.

62
00:03:45,102 --> 00:03:50,363
[SPEAKER_09]: So the Board of Aldermen sought answers to aircraft noise issues.

63
00:03:52,303 --> 00:04:03,725
[SPEAKER_09]: They actually are researching flight patterns, or asking that it be researched, flight patterns and the number of residents affected be analyzed and be compared with other runways and communities.

64
00:04:04,343 --> 00:04:05,203
[SPEAKER_09]: I read it further.

65
00:04:05,283 --> 00:04:06,563
[SPEAKER_09]: I did some research online.

66
00:04:06,604 --> 00:04:15,825
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that an article was in the Medford Patch last year, 2014, at which time Massport stated they were going to do a one-year study.

67
00:04:16,346 --> 00:04:22,247
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd like to, you know, further amend my resolve and ask that we get any results from that Massport study.

68
00:04:28,928 --> 00:04:32,049
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if Council Member Marx has anything else to add, but it seems like the

69
00:04:33,513 --> 00:04:38,195
[SPEAKER_09]: Flight patterns have doubled, and there's also an issue with the lane.

70
00:04:38,395 --> 00:04:46,339
[SPEAKER_09]: It's hard to understand, but the lane that was opened, which is Logan's runway 33 left, or R33L.

71
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:52,282
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the airport's last major runway to receive RNAV.

72
00:04:52,482 --> 00:04:59,526
[SPEAKER_09]: And planes that take off are using this new runway to fly over areas such as East Boston, Chelsea, Everett, Cambridge, Somerville, and Medford.

73
00:05:00,156 --> 00:05:06,099
[SPEAKER_09]: That opened June 2013, and I think that's the beginning of when the complaints started here.

74
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:10,702
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know last year, around this time, is when we started to get the complaints.

75
00:05:10,762 --> 00:05:11,662
[SPEAKER_09]: They kind of die off.

76
00:05:11,722 --> 00:05:15,644
[SPEAKER_09]: When all the windows close, people start going inside their homes.

77
00:05:15,724 --> 00:05:18,366
[SPEAKER_09]: So for November, December, they start dying off.

78
00:05:18,426 --> 00:05:20,827
[SPEAKER_09]: And now, all of a sudden, we're getting the complaints again.

79
00:05:20,847 --> 00:05:28,711
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're getting people who can't enjoy their backyards, or they can't even watch TV with their windows open, because these flights are every two minutes.

80
00:05:29,173 --> 00:05:32,255
[SPEAKER_09]: at least you're seeing an airplane fly over.

81
00:05:33,776 --> 00:05:37,919
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would, I would like to join in on what the city of Somerville is trying to do.

82
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:51,447
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no reason why Medford can't analyze and strategize and draft their own recommendations to Massport or ask for answers so that we can, you know, figure out if there's a way that we can lessen the inconvenience to our residents.

83
00:05:53,128 --> 00:05:53,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good.

84
00:05:53,529 --> 00:05:55,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

85
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:55,630
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Marks.

86
00:05:56,661 --> 00:05:57,602
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

87
00:05:57,622 --> 00:06:04,105
[SPEAKER_11]: And I want to thank Councilwoman Wango Kern for her resolution and her comments she just made.

88
00:06:04,766 --> 00:06:07,627
[SPEAKER_11]: This has been an ongoing issue for a number of years in the community.

89
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:24,717
[SPEAKER_11]: I know there's been several resolutions before this council asking the administration to look into why the increase of air traffic over our community, what can be done on behalf of the many residents and the many different neighborhoods

90
00:06:25,463 --> 00:06:33,965
[SPEAKER_11]: You would think that it only impacts certain areas of the city, but the complaints I'm receiving go from South Method to North Method to Wellington to West Method.

91
00:06:34,325 --> 00:06:40,487
[SPEAKER_11]: It really covers the entire city, and the disturbance is citywide.

92
00:06:41,207 --> 00:06:51,369
[SPEAKER_11]: I had the opportunity to go onto the Massport website, and they list noise disturbance by community for each year.

93
00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:54,570
[SPEAKER_11]: And this year, which is year to date,

94
00:06:55,078 --> 00:07:04,381
[SPEAKER_11]: January to April, there was 71 complaints from Method residents and 29 callers that called up.

95
00:07:04,482 --> 00:07:23,068
[SPEAKER_11]: So the numbers, you know, I think speak volume to having someone go find the number to call, first of all, because it's such a concern and impacting their daily life that we really, as a community, need to act upon this, Mr. President.

96
00:07:25,327 --> 00:07:48,352
[SPEAKER_11]: also took the liberty because the Community Advisory Committee, which is a committee that was created some years back, it's not under the auspice of Massport, but it's a separate body comprised of a resident from each of the impacted areas in a certain radius from Logan Airport.

97
00:07:49,152 --> 00:07:52,273
[SPEAKER_11]: And our representative that was appointed by the mayor,

98
00:07:53,553 --> 00:07:54,854
[SPEAKER_11]: She's been on a number of years.

99
00:07:54,914 --> 00:07:58,417
[SPEAKER_11]: Her name is Yelena, and I'll spell the last name.

100
00:07:58,977 --> 00:08:01,439
[SPEAKER_11]: It's S-H-U-L-K-I-N-A.

101
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:02,640
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's Shokina.

102
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:09,184
[SPEAKER_11]: And she is the Method CAC, Community Advisory Committee member.

103
00:08:09,965 --> 00:08:21,253
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'd like to give out her email address, Mr. President, because I think residents that have concerns should know who they can talk to, who is the representative from our community

104
00:08:21,748 --> 00:08:27,830
[SPEAKER_11]: that is representing every resident in this community when these board meetings take place.

105
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:41,275
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're the ones that have impact, that sit down with Massport and sit down with the FAA and are able to affect change on flight patents, on noise from planes, and a host of issues.

106
00:08:41,935 --> 00:08:45,496
[SPEAKER_11]: And her email address is LZLAT.

107
00:08:48,431 --> 00:08:51,813
[SPEAKER_11]: sman at yahoo.com.

108
00:08:53,314 --> 00:09:02,261
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you don't have access to email, a phone number is 781-395-1471.

109
00:09:02,961 --> 00:09:08,945
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, Yelena is our community person on the Community Advisory Committee.

110
00:09:09,766 --> 00:09:17,731
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it's only appropriate that residents that have concern, I think it was a couple years ago, Mr. President, I offered a resolution

111
00:09:18,265 --> 00:09:26,306
[SPEAKER_11]: requesting that Yelena appear before the council and update us on anything that was taking place within the advisory board.

112
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:31,727
[SPEAKER_11]: And I didn't get any response, nor did Yelena ever appear before this council.

113
00:09:32,308 --> 00:09:38,169
[SPEAKER_11]: The president of CAC, the Community Advisory Committee, is a woman by the name of Ms.

114
00:09:38,229 --> 00:09:41,169
[SPEAKER_11]: Sandra Kuntz, K-U-N-Z.

115
00:09:41,929 --> 00:09:46,210
[SPEAKER_11]: And she's the president of this, I believe, 30-member board that makes recommendations

116
00:09:46,804 --> 00:09:53,649
[SPEAKER_11]: And her email address is skunz at verizon.net.

117
00:09:54,230 --> 00:10:05,018
[SPEAKER_11]: And she is the president of the board and I guess was instrumental in putting together this citizen advisory board back some years ago because of the issues she had in her home community.

118
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:15,767
[SPEAKER_11]: Just to touch upon what Councilor Lungo-Koehn mentioned about what's taking place with the Boston Logan Airport noise study.

119
00:10:16,373 --> 00:10:18,814
[SPEAKER_11]: They refer to it as BLANS, B-L-A-N-S.

120
00:10:19,575 --> 00:10:29,219
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was supposedly a three-phase approach to addressing some of the concerns that have been mentioned by area communities.

121
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:37,423
[SPEAKER_11]: And if I could, off the website, it says, this is the largest FAA-funded noise study in the nation.

122
00:10:37,963 --> 00:10:40,704
[SPEAKER_11]: The total dollar value for the study is approximately $8.3 million.

123
00:10:42,816 --> 00:10:47,437
[SPEAKER_11]: 80%, 6.6 million, is funded by airport improvement program grants.

124
00:10:48,677 --> 00:10:55,759
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the remaining is 1.7 million, which is funded by Massport.

125
00:10:56,239 --> 00:11:10,622
[SPEAKER_11]: And the first phase of the project was culminated in October 2007 with an environmental report done and given to FAA with recommendations.

126
00:11:11,142 --> 00:11:12,142
[SPEAKER_11]: The second phase

127
00:11:12,712 --> 00:11:15,093
[SPEAKER_11]: was called the Boston Logan Airport Noise Study.

128
00:11:15,814 --> 00:11:22,498
[SPEAKER_11]: It began in 2007 and was completed in December 2012 with final results documented.

129
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:26,320
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that's what Councilor Lungo-Koehn just mentioned, that she'd like to get a copy.

130
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,981
[SPEAKER_11]: And I went on the website.

131
00:11:28,001 --> 00:11:28,581
[SPEAKER_11]: I couldn't find it.

132
00:11:28,601 --> 00:11:29,261
[SPEAKER_09]: I couldn't find it either.

133
00:11:29,301 --> 00:11:32,283
[SPEAKER_11]: I couldn't find it anywhere, the final recommendations.

134
00:11:32,703 --> 00:11:40,688
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'd also like to make as part of the report, Mr. President, that we can find out what input our community representative had or what

135
00:11:41,293 --> 00:11:46,757
[SPEAKER_11]: offerings our community representative had, if any, towards this particular report.

136
00:11:47,437 --> 00:12:00,806
[SPEAKER_11]: And the third phase, which began in July 2013, will identify and evaluate potential runway use measures to be included in a runway use program to replace the preferential runway advisory system.

137
00:12:02,007 --> 00:12:05,690
[SPEAKER_11]: The vote CAC took was in 2012, and this was to abate

138
00:12:10,127 --> 00:12:11,128
[SPEAKER_11]: uh, runway noise.

139
00:12:11,768 --> 00:12:18,532
[SPEAKER_11]: So, um, I think if we can get some feedback from the advisory committee member, it would be very helpful.

140
00:12:18,952 --> 00:12:31,680
[SPEAKER_11]: We've also, I believe a couple of years back, us representatives from Massport to appear before the council, uh, maybe because we're not in the immediate vicinity, uh, like we've Aaron Winthrop, uh, they pay no attention to us.

141
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:37,183
[SPEAKER_11]: But this is, uh, an issue that, uh, this council has been behind from day one,

142
00:12:37,995 --> 00:12:43,940
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'd like to see the administration take a more active role in this issue because it does impact.

143
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:51,967
[SPEAKER_11]: When I know in Wellington, when I'm standing in my driveway and I can read the numbers on the bottom of the belly of the airplane, you know they're low.

144
00:12:52,167 --> 00:12:52,988
[SPEAKER_11]: You have good eyes.

145
00:12:53,968 --> 00:12:55,189
[SPEAKER_11]: No, these planes are low.

146
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,090
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not my eyes.

147
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:56,891
[SPEAKER_11]: They're low.

148
00:12:57,531 --> 00:13:06,579
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, when your home shakes, when they go over, you tend to say to yourself, what are the requirements that would put us in an issue where

149
00:13:06,969 --> 00:13:08,450
[SPEAKER_11]: maybe we could get some mitigation.

150
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:09,430
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you need?

151
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:12,712
[SPEAKER_11]: When my home shakes, is that enough?

152
00:13:13,812 --> 00:13:25,118
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I'm not sure, but I was told that they have noise detectors throughout our community and that we don't reach the FAA requirements to have mitigation.

153
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:28,059
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe those standards could be lowered.

154
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:35,123
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe it's about time we look at other areas that are being impacted and seeing where these particular devices are located.

155
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:38,499
[SPEAKER_11]: In my opinion, Mr. President, something needs to be done.

156
00:13:39,239 --> 00:13:48,128
[SPEAKER_07]: And- I know Massport did a mitigation project several years ago, maybe within the past four years, of window replacement in Chelsea and East Boston.

157
00:13:48,468 --> 00:13:48,629
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

158
00:13:48,829 --> 00:14:00,120
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, we may not be at that level, but we were close to a level where I was told also that they were looking at other routes to go over the Mystic and

159
00:14:00,904 --> 00:14:04,385
[SPEAKER_11]: and take the planes in a different area rather than over our neighborhoods.

160
00:14:05,065 --> 00:14:16,789
[SPEAKER_11]: And I believe that that was taking place, but I haven't seen much in regards to that because I still, on Sunday mornings, you can almost set your watch by it.

161
00:14:17,169 --> 00:14:21,370
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, when they're coming overhead at 6.30 in the morning, you know, it's going to last three hours.

162
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:25,371
[SPEAKER_11]: Then certain nights, you'll hear them, you know, at 6, 7 o'clock at night.

163
00:14:25,871 --> 00:14:29,132
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's, like I said, it's throughout the community.

164
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:32,850
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, I want to thank Councilor Lungo for bringing this up.

165
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:35,351
[SPEAKER_11]: And the residents, I know there's a resident that wants to speak.

166
00:14:35,771 --> 00:14:45,876
[SPEAKER_11]: The number of residents that have been sending emails to this council and to this administration to help resolve this important quality of life issue, Mr. President.

167
00:14:46,196 --> 00:14:47,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

168
00:14:47,117 --> 00:14:55,981
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the motion of Councilors Lungo and Marks, as amended by both Councilors Lungo and Marks,

169
00:14:56,373 --> 00:14:57,213
[SPEAKER_07]: Madam Vice President.

170
00:14:57,273 --> 00:14:57,594
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

171
00:14:57,834 --> 00:15:06,457
[SPEAKER_09]: Briefly, if we could, if we could actually ask the Medford's rep to come again, I know maybe send her an email or a letter in the mail.

172
00:15:07,178 --> 00:15:13,860
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's probably somebody getting somebody from the board is going to, we're going to learn a lot more that way than trying to do our research and ask the administration.

173
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:17,342
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we could ask again, that would be helpful.

174
00:15:17,742 --> 00:15:24,925
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know it back in 2013, Logan airport adopted a straight line, a way of approaching the airport, which was,

175
00:15:25,355 --> 00:15:30,278
[SPEAKER_09]: They used to do a roundabout way, which is one of the reasons why planes are flying lower.

176
00:15:30,298 --> 00:15:43,465
[SPEAKER_09]: The Federal Aviation Administration, which uses radar approach points, allow planes to fly, within the last two years, shorter distances, which reduce fuel usage and carbon emissions.

177
00:15:43,545 --> 00:15:45,347
[SPEAKER_09]: So there is a reason why.

178
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:46,947
[SPEAKER_09]: Planes are definitely flying low.

179
00:15:47,268 --> 00:15:49,129
[SPEAKER_09]: There is a reason why we're getting these complaints.

180
00:15:49,289 --> 00:15:52,230
[SPEAKER_09]: And therefore, there's a reason for the study and the money being spent.

181
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:56,972
[SPEAKER_09]: to make sure the decibels are within normal ranges.

182
00:15:57,092 --> 00:16:10,041
[SPEAKER_09]: Because if you're researching online, too, a lot of things that I found today and yesterday that were popping up were health risks and detrimental effects that this noise level can have on a human being.

183
00:16:10,141 --> 00:16:20,667
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would like to obviously get that report on that one-year study and definitely see if we can get any report on any other studies that are having to do with any of the noise levels.

184
00:16:21,288 --> 00:16:21,548
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

185
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,661
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

186
00:16:23,681 --> 00:16:24,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight.

187
00:16:25,102 --> 00:16:26,423
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

188
00:16:26,603 --> 00:16:29,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Madam Vice President, Councilor Marks, thank you very much for your remarks on this topic as well.

189
00:16:30,726 --> 00:16:42,554
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's all well and good that we can bring a member of the CAC in here to discuss the flight patents, but Massport also has an Office of Community Relations, and they also have an Office of Government Affairs.

190
00:16:43,134 --> 00:16:51,440
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd like to amend the resolution to ask that Jose Maceo, who would be the Community Relations Director, and Nancy Donahue, the Assistant Director of Government Affairs, also be invited.

191
00:16:52,207 --> 00:16:53,849
[SPEAKER_05]: to a meeting to discuss the flight patents.

192
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:56,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I think it would be very productive to have all parties involved.

193
00:16:56,972 --> 00:16:57,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

194
00:16:57,812 --> 00:17:04,699
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the motion of Vice President Lombo-Kern and Councilor Marks, as amended by both, and Councilor Knight.

195
00:17:05,239 --> 00:17:06,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Sir, you wish to speak on this matter.

196
00:17:06,941 --> 00:17:08,402
[SPEAKER_07]: Please state your name and address for the record.

197
00:17:08,422 --> 00:17:08,943
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening.

198
00:17:09,303 --> 00:17:09,563
[SPEAKER_14]: I do.

199
00:17:09,623 --> 00:17:10,624
[SPEAKER_14]: My name is Michael Ruggiero.

200
00:17:10,644 --> 00:17:12,206
[SPEAKER_14]: I live on 18 Pembroke Street.

201
00:17:13,107 --> 00:17:16,149
[SPEAKER_14]: As Councilor Lombo-Kern mentioned,

202
00:17:17,228 --> 00:17:26,630
[SPEAKER_14]: With the installation of the virtual runway, 33L, when there is a northwest-heading wind in Logan, we can receive up to two flights every minute.

203
00:17:27,151 --> 00:17:31,232
[SPEAKER_14]: The flights are heaviest often at night when there is a northwest wind into Boston.

204
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:34,472
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a number of different groups that are involved.

205
00:17:35,553 --> 00:17:40,454
[SPEAKER_14]: One of the information that I'm reading right now, just to give people a heads up that are listening at home,

206
00:17:41,648 --> 00:17:54,577
[SPEAKER_14]: If you go to bostonwestfairskies.com, there's a number of listing of information about the flight paths.

207
00:17:55,698 --> 00:18:00,842
[SPEAKER_14]: As a father of a nine-month-old baby, I can tell you it can be pretty extreme living.

208
00:18:01,062 --> 00:18:02,503
[SPEAKER_14]: And we live at the convergence.

209
00:18:02,543 --> 00:18:05,605
[SPEAKER_14]: Medford is the convergence of five different paths.

210
00:18:06,265 --> 00:18:10,008
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's not that there are just so many more people flying into Boston.

211
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:15,708
[SPEAKER_14]: It's that the people that are flying to Boston are going on fewer and fewer paths, and they're all converging onto Medford.

212
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:16,688
[SPEAKER_14]: So, thank you.

213
00:18:18,089 --> 00:18:18,449
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

214
00:18:18,929 --> 00:18:19,849
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, Councilor Camuso.

215
00:18:21,409 --> 00:18:21,749
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

216
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:24,610
[SPEAKER_15]: And, um, I can certainly understand the frustrations.

217
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:35,252
[SPEAKER_15]: My home is right, uh, right underneath one of the paths and it seems like every weekend it's, uh, it's, it's coming from like the Winchester line right over, uh, the large Memorial hospital and, uh, into Logan.

218
00:18:35,813 --> 00:18:37,573
[SPEAKER_15]: And, uh, it is, it is, um,

219
00:18:39,245 --> 00:18:40,567
[SPEAKER_15]: It's louder some days than others.

220
00:18:40,587 --> 00:18:49,514
[SPEAKER_15]: When the bigger planes, the 747s, are either taking off or landing, it's a lot louder than some of the smaller A320s and some of them double-engine planes.

221
00:18:51,395 --> 00:18:55,098
[SPEAKER_15]: I certainly agree with the resolve in looking in to see if there's some mitigation money out there.

222
00:18:55,459 --> 00:19:03,926
[SPEAKER_15]: But I also am very cognizant of the fact that Massport's first and most top priority is for the safety of the flights in and out of Logan Airport.

223
00:19:04,546 --> 00:19:06,688
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm sure they'll work with us any way they can.

224
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:09,853
[SPEAKER_15]: But this is a catch-22, this situation.

225
00:19:10,214 --> 00:19:19,699
[SPEAKER_15]: For the same reason people are paying a large amount of money for their homes here in our community, it's because of its proximity to Boston, to the airport, to the financial district, and everything else.

226
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,102
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's sort of a catch-22, shall we say.

227
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:28,263
[SPEAKER_15]: I know Councilor Marks championed this issue many years ago.

228
00:19:28,303 --> 00:19:30,305
[SPEAKER_15]: He was on the front page of the Boston Herald.

229
00:19:30,325 --> 00:19:32,086
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it was the Herald, was it, Councilor?

230
00:19:33,286 --> 00:19:34,727
[SPEAKER_15]: With this very particular matter.

231
00:19:35,165 --> 00:19:46,670
[SPEAKER_15]: And as I said in my conversations with Massport officials at the time, and that was about three or four years ago, I believe, more than that, as Councilor Mark says, they understand the frustrations.

232
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:57,195
[SPEAKER_15]: And if we do meet a threshold in certain areas of the community, then there is sometimes funding out there to do mitigation within the homes.

233
00:19:57,575 --> 00:20:03,898
[SPEAKER_15]: I know Winthrop receives a lot of money for the homes right in Winthrop, East Boston.

234
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:17,417
[SPEAKER_15]: But like I said, unfortunately, this is, and I don't want to underestimate the severity of the noise, believe me, because I understand it wholeheartedly.

235
00:20:17,437 --> 00:20:27,503
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a five-year-old, but I also am very cognizant of the fact that it is seven miles from Boston.

236
00:20:27,883 --> 00:20:31,425
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is one thing that we have to expect, maybe not with the volume,

237
00:20:31,892 --> 00:20:35,073
[SPEAKER_15]: But Boston, it's an international airport.

238
00:20:35,513 --> 00:20:39,754
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not like Lawrence or Hyannis Airport, where you get flights every so often.

239
00:20:40,095 --> 00:20:41,475
[SPEAKER_15]: We're an international airport.

240
00:20:41,515 --> 00:20:43,015
[SPEAKER_15]: You look at these planes, and they are low.

241
00:20:43,256 --> 00:20:47,517
[SPEAKER_15]: You can read them, Lufthansa, Alitalia, and things of that nature.

242
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:50,598
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm more concerned about the safety.

243
00:20:51,098 --> 00:21:00,541
[SPEAKER_15]: Like I said, quite frankly, right after September 11th in the year 2001, there was an airline accident that happened right in New York.

244
00:21:01,146 --> 00:21:15,695
[SPEAKER_15]: and it wasn't terrorist, it was mechanical failure or something of that nature, but it was, it landed under mechanical distress or whatever it was in a very populated area that was homes and things of that nature.

245
00:21:17,256 --> 00:21:27,001
[SPEAKER_15]: So as I understand it, and the other thing is too, as the gentleman that comes up here weekly with his little tablet looking up webpages said so eloquently,

246
00:21:28,598 --> 00:21:30,860
[SPEAKER_15]: He alluded to the fact of the winds.

247
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:35,723
[SPEAKER_15]: The planes have to take off into the wind in order to get off the ground.

248
00:21:37,064 --> 00:21:45,410
[SPEAKER_15]: So with that being said, a lot of the takeoffs are predicated upon the wind and the weather and all that too.

249
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:52,015
[SPEAKER_15]: But I certainly do agree with the studies that Councilor Marks brought up years ago and Councilor Lungo-Koehn again this evening.

250
00:21:52,456 --> 00:21:53,937
[SPEAKER_15]: So I do support this.

251
00:21:54,297 --> 00:21:58,000
[SPEAKER_15]: But I just, as I stated, I'm not going to repeat the will,

252
00:21:59,387 --> 00:22:04,169
[SPEAKER_15]: And I've heard that many people in the community this weekend at the coffee shop stated, because they read the council agenda.

253
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:15,334
[SPEAKER_15]: And they were a little bit like, hey, when I moved to Medford from Salem, Mass., I knew I was paying $575,000 for my home to get closer to Boston.

254
00:22:15,374 --> 00:22:17,675
[SPEAKER_15]: And this was one of the setbacks.

255
00:22:18,576 --> 00:22:20,536
[SPEAKER_15]: But I certainly understand all the frustrations out there.

256
00:22:21,177 --> 00:22:22,217
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

257
00:22:22,337 --> 00:22:23,198
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Karafiello.

258
00:22:23,578 --> 00:22:24,498
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

259
00:22:25,078 --> 00:22:28,500
[SPEAKER_10]: Now that the nice weather's out, and everyone's out, and the yards and the windows are open,

260
00:22:29,035 --> 00:22:30,916
[SPEAKER_10]: You're hearing the noise a lot more than you did over the winter.

261
00:22:30,936 --> 00:22:38,982
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know how many people know, but over the next two to three years, there's going to be 11 more international airlines flying into Logan Airport.

262
00:22:40,262 --> 00:22:42,124
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're flying in with those bigger planes.

263
00:22:42,144 --> 00:22:44,385
[SPEAKER_10]: So the problem is only going to get worse.

264
00:22:44,445 --> 00:22:45,326
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not going to get better.

265
00:22:45,686 --> 00:22:50,629
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think it's time that we do get the study out there and get somebody in there.

266
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:53,531
[SPEAKER_10]: Because as I said, the problem is just going to continue to grow.

267
00:22:54,992 --> 00:22:56,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

268
00:22:56,565 --> 00:22:59,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Ma'am, please state your name and address for the record.

269
00:22:59,768 --> 00:23:01,910
[SPEAKER_12]: Ann Donati, 29 Gaston Street.

270
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:02,571
[SPEAKER_12]: D-O-N-A-T-I.

271
00:23:10,023 --> 00:23:10,343
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.

272
00:23:10,824 --> 00:23:18,050
[SPEAKER_12]: So last summer, I thought all the airplane noise was in my head, that I was just imagining all the noise.

273
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:22,133
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I saw the front page of the transcript, residents hear the roar.

274
00:23:22,714 --> 00:23:23,314
[SPEAKER_12]: I read that.

275
00:23:23,714 --> 00:23:32,061
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I saw a few news segments on Channel 5 and some of the news stations about the airplane noise.

276
00:23:32,101 --> 00:23:33,222
[SPEAKER_12]: So I said, it's not in my head.

277
00:23:33,342 --> 00:23:36,525
[SPEAKER_12]: So I started to file complaints with Massport.

278
00:23:37,245 --> 00:23:38,947
[SPEAKER_12]: And then they send you these little notices.

279
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:49,656
[SPEAKER_12]: which basically are useless and say, yes, you are affected by the noise, which I don't think is very helpful, as opposed to saying, we'll try to do this, we'll try to do that.

280
00:23:49,896 --> 00:24:06,707
[SPEAKER_12]: So anyway, when it started up this, the beginning of May, that's when I started emailing the city council, filing more complaints with Massport, and I've been keeping a log of all the noise, and it started on April 30th,

281
00:24:07,848 --> 00:24:08,709
[SPEAKER_12]: and it's 10 p.m.

282
00:24:08,769 --> 00:24:09,329
[SPEAKER_12]: to midnight.

283
00:24:09,789 --> 00:24:11,110
[SPEAKER_12]: It's 5.30 a.m.

284
00:24:12,411 --> 00:24:14,353
[SPEAKER_12]: May 19th, it was 12.30 a.m.

285
00:24:14,433 --> 00:24:15,634
[SPEAKER_12]: to 1.30 a.m.

286
00:24:17,415 --> 00:24:21,578
[SPEAKER_12]: This noise has to stop, especially at these hours.

287
00:24:21,818 --> 00:24:32,906
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, people have to get up to go to work, and I cannot have these jetliners literally right over my house,

288
00:24:33,981 --> 00:24:35,122
[SPEAKER_12]: This is how close they are.

289
00:24:35,202 --> 00:24:39,445
[SPEAKER_12]: They are right over my house at all these hours at night.

290
00:24:39,525 --> 00:24:42,867
[SPEAKER_12]: And I feel like the bomb's going to drop.

291
00:24:43,327 --> 00:24:44,408
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a night picture.

292
00:24:44,888 --> 00:24:47,510
[SPEAKER_12]: But I'm beside myself.

293
00:24:49,711 --> 00:24:51,552
[SPEAKER_12]: I have new windows in my house.

294
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:53,974
[SPEAKER_12]: I would like to have my windows open.

295
00:24:55,275 --> 00:24:59,738
[SPEAKER_12]: I understand that when we had winter storms,

296
00:25:00,805 --> 00:25:03,808
[SPEAKER_12]: used to come fly over the houses, you know, to avoid the ocean.

297
00:25:04,188 --> 00:25:08,812
[SPEAKER_12]: I understand all that, but this on a regular basis has to stop.

298
00:25:10,374 --> 00:25:11,074
[SPEAKER_12]: It's insane.

299
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:14,517
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't know what else to do.

300
00:25:15,238 --> 00:25:16,559
[SPEAKER_12]: But I'm glad that everybody is

301
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:21,704
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, paying attention to it, trying to nip it in the bud.

302
00:25:22,624 --> 00:25:32,047
[SPEAKER_12]: But I don't think the resolution to give people new windows is going to help because, like you said, it's just going to get worse.

303
00:25:32,347 --> 00:25:34,008
[SPEAKER_12]: So we need to nip this in the bud.

304
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:43,475
[SPEAKER_12]: And if anybody wants to hear, I have recordings of these jetliners over our houses.

305
00:25:43,555 --> 00:25:44,656
[SPEAKER_12]: One of my neighbors is here.

306
00:25:45,897 --> 00:25:47,918
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just crazy.

307
00:25:48,999 --> 00:25:50,840
[SPEAKER_12]: And like you said, you hear it too.

308
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,282
[SPEAKER_12]: And you can read the names of the planes.

309
00:25:54,823 --> 00:25:55,924
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just crazy.

310
00:25:57,164 --> 00:25:58,866
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm very upset.

311
00:25:59,866 --> 00:26:01,647
[SPEAKER_12]: And I've been a resident.

312
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:04,701
[SPEAKER_12]: in Medford since 1998.

313
00:26:05,802 --> 00:26:08,023
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, I'm used to the plane noise.

314
00:26:08,183 --> 00:26:13,467
[SPEAKER_12]: But last summer and this summer, I can't live like this.

315
00:26:13,767 --> 00:26:23,453
[SPEAKER_12]: And if I ever put my house on the market because of this noise, and a prospective buyer wanted to come in and look at it, and this noise is going over, they'd run like the wind.

316
00:26:23,573 --> 00:26:24,834
[SPEAKER_12]: Who would want to move here?

317
00:26:25,855 --> 00:26:30,218
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm very nervous.

318
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:32,239
[SPEAKER_12]: But thanks for listening.

319
00:26:33,037 --> 00:26:34,458
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much for coming.

320
00:26:36,719 --> 00:26:40,881
[SPEAKER_12]: Nobody wants to hear my recordings, but all right, I'll do one.

321
00:26:44,522 --> 00:26:44,862
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.

322
00:26:47,824 --> 00:26:48,064
[SPEAKER_12]: May 7.

323
00:26:59,929 --> 00:27:00,950
[SPEAKER_12]: That was the beginning of May.

324
00:27:06,008 --> 00:27:07,048
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is a cheapie.

325
00:27:07,549 --> 00:27:10,390
[SPEAKER_12]: This is not, uh, that's yes.

326
00:27:11,831 --> 00:27:12,571
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, let's see.

327
00:27:12,671 --> 00:27:13,891
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a whole bunch of them.

328
00:27:13,951 --> 00:27:16,933
[SPEAKER_12]: This one I think was during, what did it say?

329
00:27:17,113 --> 00:27:17,873
[SPEAKER_12]: April 30th.

330
00:27:17,933 --> 00:27:19,574
[SPEAKER_12]: This was 10 PM to midnight.

331
00:27:20,534 --> 00:27:21,935
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a whole slew of them.

332
00:27:22,955 --> 00:27:26,717
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, this is a cheapie, but I think, did you hear it a little bit?

333
00:27:27,997 --> 00:27:33,760
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, you know, all right, I'll do one more and then I'll let my neighbor speak.

334
00:27:34,732 --> 00:27:37,072
[SPEAKER_12]: This one is the one at 1230.

335
00:27:37,132 --> 00:27:37,833
[SPEAKER_12]: Tuesday, 1230 AM, May 19.

336
00:27:37,873 --> 00:27:40,613
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is at 1230 AM.

337
00:27:40,633 --> 00:27:40,993
[SPEAKER_12]: It's insane.

338
00:28:05,959 --> 00:28:06,219
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry.

339
00:28:06,859 --> 00:28:08,460
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know how else to describe this.

340
00:28:13,801 --> 00:28:15,761
[SPEAKER_12]: So, thank you.

341
00:28:16,341 --> 00:28:17,581
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much for coming.

342
00:28:17,601 --> 00:28:24,303
[SPEAKER_12]: And you all have my email, so please feel free to contact me if you need me to support our cause.

343
00:28:26,263 --> 00:28:26,683
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

344
00:28:27,003 --> 00:28:27,423
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

345
00:28:28,064 --> 00:28:28,384
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

346
00:28:29,364 --> 00:28:29,804
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening.

347
00:28:29,884 --> 00:28:31,584
[SPEAKER_17]: Please state your name and address for the record.

348
00:28:31,904 --> 00:28:32,765
[SPEAKER_17]: Chris Omlet, 35 Gaston Street.

349
00:28:37,194 --> 00:28:50,383
[SPEAKER_17]: I was born in this city, and I've been a resident for 43 years, and I bought my house based on the quiet of the neighborhood.

350
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:56,787
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I could literally throw a rock from my backyard to the house I grew up in.

351
00:28:58,748 --> 00:29:04,152
[SPEAKER_17]: That's where I wanted to raise my children, because it was a nice place to live.

352
00:29:06,714 --> 00:29:14,198
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, now I can't sleep at night, and it's ridiculous.

353
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:24,504
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't know why they can't, at nighttime at least, come out, come over the ocean.

354
00:29:25,065 --> 00:29:26,185
[SPEAKER_17]: Nobody's living out there.

355
00:29:29,988 --> 00:29:33,310
[SPEAKER_17]: For real, I mean, I pay more and more taxes.

356
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:37,001
[SPEAKER_17]: And my quality of life is going down and down and down.

357
00:29:39,342 --> 00:29:39,702
[SPEAKER_17]: You know?

358
00:29:42,044 --> 00:29:49,348
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I can't even sit out in the backyard and have a conversation with my brothers and sisters with one of these things coming over.

359
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:51,429
[SPEAKER_17]: You know?

360
00:29:52,169 --> 00:29:53,210
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just ridiculous.

361
00:29:54,010 --> 00:30:01,655
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I don't know what you guys can do, if anything, but

362
00:30:02,877 --> 00:30:17,046
[SPEAKER_17]: Any help you can give us would be very much appreciated, very, very much appreciated, because this is really, really getting tough.

363
00:30:18,147 --> 00:30:19,127
[SPEAKER_17]: So I thank you all.

364
00:30:20,588 --> 00:30:21,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for coming down tonight.

365
00:30:22,189 --> 00:30:30,755
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the motion of Vice President Lungo-Koehn and Councilor Marks, as amended by the same and Councilor Knight, all those in favor?

366
00:30:32,055 --> 00:30:34,456
[SPEAKER_07]: A roll call vote has been requested, Mr. Clerk.

367
00:30:35,217 --> 00:30:36,317
[SPEAKER_07]: Could you please call the roll?

368
00:30:44,441 --> 00:30:45,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Camuso?

369
00:30:45,661 --> 00:30:45,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

370
00:30:46,662 --> 00:30:47,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Caraviello?

371
00:30:47,682 --> 00:30:47,882
Yes.

372
00:30:48,303 --> 00:30:48,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight?

373
00:30:48,963 --> 00:30:49,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

374
00:30:49,623 --> 00:30:50,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Lungo-Koehn?

375
00:30:50,824 --> 00:30:50,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

376
00:30:51,244 --> 00:30:51,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks?

377
00:30:52,024 --> 00:30:52,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

378
00:30:52,345 --> 00:30:52,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Penta?

379
00:30:52,865 --> 00:30:52,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

380
00:30:53,705 --> 00:30:54,526
[SPEAKER_07]: President Dello Russo?

381
00:30:54,626 --> 00:30:54,906
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

382
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:57,007
[SPEAKER_07]: And the vote is seven in the affirmative, none negative.

383
00:30:57,027 --> 00:30:59,128
[SPEAKER_07]: The motion is passed and so ordered.

384
00:31:02,562 --> 00:31:23,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Penta while we're still in the suspension of the rules, can we take 15 for 95 please on the motion of council of Penta to take people out of order 15 for 95 all those in favor of those opposed carries a 15 or four 95 offered by Councilor Penta be resolved that the problem of a Medford business woman, uh, be addressed.

385
00:31:23,167 --> 00:31:23,908
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Penta.

386
00:31:24,548 --> 00:31:27,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, members of the council, there was a lady out in the audience.

387
00:31:27,709 --> 00:31:29,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I believe she's going to address the council.

388
00:31:30,401 --> 00:31:53,117
[SPEAKER_02]: It's another ongoing saga of what Republic, the parking company, has been doing in the city, the consternation it's been causing to business merchants within the community, and the fact that, if you can come up, the fact that this business is, and she'll be able to tell you herself, it's becoming less and less, it's almost to the point it's going to put her out of business, but I'll let her speak for herself.

389
00:31:54,127 --> 00:31:57,008
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I think you all know why I'm here.

390
00:31:58,448 --> 00:32:07,810
[SPEAKER_16]: This is just 337 people that do not want the kiosk in the square, or any part of Medford for that fact.

391
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:13,011
[SPEAKER_16]: I see people out there every day, they don't even know what to do.

392
00:32:13,491 --> 00:32:18,752
[SPEAKER_16]: The sun's shining and they can't see, you know, what to do there.

393
00:32:19,252 --> 00:32:20,432
[SPEAKER_16]: And they're standing out there.

394
00:32:22,033 --> 00:32:23,053
[SPEAKER_16]: It's very frustrating.

395
00:32:23,878 --> 00:32:27,479
[SPEAKER_16]: And of course, I'm working three days a week now.

396
00:32:27,939 --> 00:32:28,779
[SPEAKER_16]: It's down to that.

397
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:34,361
[SPEAKER_16]: And I don't feel like I'm going to be staying in business much longer.

398
00:32:34,921 --> 00:32:35,861
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm not the only one.

399
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:42,142
[SPEAKER_16]: Everybody I spoke to in Medford Square, they're all unhappy, very unhappy.

400
00:32:42,662 --> 00:32:46,783
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think there should have been another way.

401
00:32:47,404 --> 00:32:49,124
[SPEAKER_16]: Why didn't they put cops on the beach?

402
00:32:49,957 --> 00:32:53,879
[SPEAKER_16]: And for the ones that are there all day and park their cars to go into Boston.

403
00:32:54,479 --> 00:32:55,880
[SPEAKER_16]: Those are the ones they should have went after.

404
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,041
[SPEAKER_16]: Now I hear this, oh, there's plenty of parking.

405
00:32:59,481 --> 00:32:59,982
[SPEAKER_16]: You know why?

406
00:33:00,002 --> 00:33:01,823
[SPEAKER_16]: They're boycotting.

407
00:33:01,983 --> 00:33:03,543
[SPEAKER_16]: Everybody's boycotting.

408
00:33:03,563 --> 00:33:04,784
[SPEAKER_16]: They don't want to pay.

409
00:33:04,864 --> 00:33:05,925
[SPEAKER_16]: It's the principle of it.

410
00:33:06,405 --> 00:33:07,165
[SPEAKER_16]: And I don't blame them.

411
00:33:08,806 --> 00:33:10,487
[SPEAKER_16]: What have you got in Medford Square?

412
00:33:10,907 --> 00:33:13,048
[SPEAKER_16]: Salons and restaurants.

413
00:33:14,108 --> 00:33:15,149
[SPEAKER_16]: What else are they going to come for?

414
00:33:18,243 --> 00:33:21,124
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm afraid Medford Square is just going to die right out.

415
00:33:23,924 --> 00:33:25,005
[SPEAKER_16]: That's all I have to say.

416
00:33:25,285 --> 00:33:28,846
[SPEAKER_16]: But this is just 337 people, and it's still going in my shop.

417
00:33:29,426 --> 00:33:29,906
[SPEAKER_16]: OK?

418
00:33:30,126 --> 00:33:32,066
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to add that to the record.

419
00:33:32,626 --> 00:33:44,569
[SPEAKER_07]: If you would give that to the city messenger, and he'll present it to the clerk to be affixed to the permanent record of the city of Medford.

420
00:33:44,629 --> 00:33:47,270
[SPEAKER_07]: Did Councilor Panto want to address?

421
00:33:47,751 --> 00:33:49,993
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Penta's going to have the floor.

422
00:33:52,975 --> 00:33:54,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Chris, could you come to that?

423
00:33:56,678 --> 00:33:58,520
[SPEAKER_02]: How long have you been doing business in Medford Square?

424
00:33:58,540 --> 00:33:58,900
[SPEAKER_16]: 30 years.

425
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,661
[SPEAKER_02]: 30 years.

426
00:33:59,921 --> 00:34:02,603
[SPEAKER_16]: And I still want to continue working, because I love it.

427
00:34:03,604 --> 00:34:08,348
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thank you for coming forward and presenting the signatures of individuals.

428
00:34:08,448 --> 00:34:14,733
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the complaints that you just talked about is something that Councilor Caraviello mentioned way back when, that nobody can read the screen.

429
00:34:14,833 --> 00:34:16,214
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the blur of the sun.

430
00:34:16,708 --> 00:34:17,568
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever it might be.

431
00:34:17,948 --> 00:34:25,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, this past week, over and beyond your situation, two more people, one in particular, and I have pictures right here.

432
00:34:26,131 --> 00:34:32,293
[SPEAKER_02]: They still have kiosks in High Street in front of residential homes that were supposed to have been taken out months ago.

433
00:34:32,753 --> 00:34:35,174
[SPEAKER_02]: The snow has been gone for a long period of time.

434
00:34:35,474 --> 00:34:41,836
[SPEAKER_02]: They're still there, and people crazily are trying to put money into a machine in front of a two-filming house that they shouldn't have to.

435
00:34:42,416 --> 00:34:43,817
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at the same time,

436
00:34:45,163 --> 00:34:53,188
[SPEAKER_02]: co-worker, a co-business friend of yours in the West Method area, a girl had to get off the chair with her co-rollers in her hair to go and put money in the meter.

437
00:34:53,488 --> 00:34:55,589
[SPEAKER_02]: And she couldn't even put the money in the same meter.

438
00:34:55,609 --> 00:34:56,830
[SPEAKER_02]: She had to find another spot.

439
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:58,411
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how crazy this whole system is.

440
00:34:59,131 --> 00:35:01,132
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think it's Mr. Ruggieri.

441
00:35:01,172 --> 00:35:01,973
[SPEAKER_02]: He's still out there.

442
00:35:02,313 --> 00:35:06,875
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been very helpful on this, on dissecting and getting into the contract, as well as myself.

443
00:35:07,416 --> 00:35:11,438
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe there's approximately nine infractions that they have committed.

444
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:13,571
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, the city has an active opponent.

445
00:35:13,651 --> 00:35:14,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Why, I don't know.

446
00:35:14,431 --> 00:35:16,792
[SPEAKER_02]: But all I can tell you is this.

447
00:35:18,313 --> 00:35:21,514
[SPEAKER_02]: As a candidate for mayor, that's going to be the first thing I am going to address.

448
00:35:21,834 --> 00:35:27,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Those kiosks and the damage that it's doing here to the merchants and the entire city of Medford.

449
00:35:27,497 --> 00:35:28,557
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thank you for bringing that forward.

450
00:35:28,577 --> 00:35:30,218
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it'll be much appreciated.

451
00:35:30,618 --> 00:35:31,018
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

452
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:34,980
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight.

453
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:36,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President.

454
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:46,925
[SPEAKER_05]: woman's gone through extensive lengths to get these signatures, and to take them and place them on file with the city clerk might not be the best approach.

455
00:35:46,945 --> 00:35:55,109
[SPEAKER_05]: I think maybe we should send these signatures over to the Traffic Commission to let the Traffic Commission know how much opposition there is out there in the community where they're the governing body.

456
00:35:55,870 --> 00:36:05,015
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the motion of Councilor Knight, can we take that as a resolution that this petition be forwarded

457
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:08,131
[SPEAKER_07]: to the Medford Traffic Commission.

458
00:36:08,771 --> 00:36:13,514
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the motion of Councilor Knight, all those in favor?

459
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:19,657
[SPEAKER_05]: What was the original motion?

460
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:20,357
[SPEAKER_05]: There was no motion.

461
00:36:20,557 --> 00:36:25,519
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just discussed.

462
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,401
[SPEAKER_05]: The signatures, right, yeah.

463
00:36:29,901 --> 00:36:31,242
[SPEAKER_07]: On that, all those in favor?

464

[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

473
00:36:56,586 --> 00:36:57,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks?

474
00:36:57,446 --> 00:36:57,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

483
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:16,213

520
00:41:16,908 --> 00:41:18,329

542
00:44:00,473 --> 00:44:06,795
[SPEAKER_07]: Please have the mayor's office provide a detailed explanation of where the previously allocated funds were spent.

543
00:44:06,875 --> 00:44:07,795
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Caraviello.

544
00:44:08,035 --> 00:44:08,835
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

545
00:44:10,392 --> 00:44:12,792
[SPEAKER_10]: Last year, Councilor Marks brought this forward.

546
00:44:13,713 --> 00:44:16,173
[SPEAKER_10]: We had a lengthy discussion over fixing the bathrooms.

547
00:44:16,933 --> 00:44:21,814
[SPEAKER_10]: And, if I'm not mistaken, $10,000 was allocated to fix the bathrooms.

548
00:44:22,214 --> 00:44:27,415
[SPEAKER_10]: And all we ever got was a couple of faucets changed over there.

549
00:44:27,435 --> 00:44:30,275
[SPEAKER_10]: And over the weekend, I was home doing some yard work.

550
00:44:33,156 --> 00:44:39,117
[SPEAKER_10]: I was home doing some yard work and outside and a neighbor came by and says, I went to the library last week.

551
00:44:39,548 --> 00:44:44,231
[SPEAKER_10]: with my grandson, he said the library was so bad, the bathroom was so bad, he says I wouldn't let him go to the bathroom in there.

552
00:44:45,172 --> 00:44:49,835
[SPEAKER_10]: He said, what happened to the money that you guys allocated for the repairing of it?

553
00:44:50,235 --> 00:45:01,363
[SPEAKER_10]: So at this point, Mr. President, I'd like to have the mayor's office provide an explanation of where the $10,000 that we authorized for the bathrooms have gone.

554
00:45:02,223 --> 00:45:06,146
[SPEAKER_10]: And this guy was a plumber, he says, if you want, he says, I'll do the work in there.

555
00:45:07,147 --> 00:45:08,728
[SPEAKER_10]: Some licensed plumber, he says, just buy the stock.

556
00:45:09,548 --> 00:45:12,850
[SPEAKER_10]: He said, I'm sure we can get other volunteers to do the work.

557
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:18,915
[SPEAKER_10]: But at this point, the library is going down and down every year.

558
00:45:21,257 --> 00:45:29,763
[SPEAKER_10]: There's less funds being allocated to it, but at least we could have some clean, decent bathroom facilities for the children to use there.

559
00:45:30,043 --> 00:45:34,767
[SPEAKER_10]: Because with the new children's librarian, you're seeing an upturn in kids going there.

560
00:45:35,407 --> 00:45:39,889
[SPEAKER_10]: And if they've gone in the bathrooms there, they're council members ready when they're deplorable.

561
00:45:41,209 --> 00:45:41,789
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

562
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:43,490
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

563
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:45,671
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the motion of Councilor Caraviello, Councilor Knight.

564
00:45:47,232 --> 00:45:48,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

565
00:45:49,172 --> 00:46:00,256
[SPEAKER_05]: I do believe this council has on multiple occasions requested the capital needs of all the buildings that are underneath the control and jurisdiction of the city government, but also specifically the library.

566
00:46:00,677 --> 00:46:04,278
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that this information will be very helpful, Mr. President, as we begin our

567
00:46:04,668 --> 00:46:06,069
[SPEAKER_05]: preparations for the budget debates.

568
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:23,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Presently, if you take a look at the Medford transcript, you'll see a great article by Mr. Ruppenthal that speaks about the funding shortages at the library and the risk that the city has been in, in losing its certification from the state.

569
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:27,803
[SPEAKER_05]: So it looks right now that based upon the figures that I read,

570
00:46:28,463 --> 00:46:40,325
[SPEAKER_05]: We're about a quarter of a million dollars short in fully funding the library to make ourselves in a position where we would not require a state waiver and enable the ability to maintain certification, Mr. President.

571
00:46:40,345 --> 00:46:47,767
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think there's a lot of stuff that's going on at the library right now that really needs to be looked at or else we're going to be in a position where we might actually lose this asset.

572
00:46:48,467 --> 00:46:49,467
[SPEAKER_05]: The building's in rough shape.

573
00:46:49,507 --> 00:46:53,348
[SPEAKER_05]: I know over the winter there was a significant amount of snow buildup that resulted in

574
00:46:54,148 --> 00:46:57,869
[SPEAKER_05]: some leaks and some ice dams that have damaged some books in the children's section.

575
00:46:58,369 --> 00:47:01,050
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the issue with the bathroom as well.

576
00:47:01,590 --> 00:47:07,992
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, the discussions that we've had in the past about expanding and making a media center on the second floor of the library and building up the library.

577
00:47:08,012 --> 00:47:19,675
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think now is an important time to take a look at what's going on there in terms of the capital side of things, Mr. President, and as we begin our debates for the budget, determine whether or not the library is being funded at a level that's appropriate.

578
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:21,556
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

579
00:47:21,776 --> 00:47:22,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Penta.

580
00:47:22,732 --> 00:47:31,998
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the issues that are equally of a concerning matter is the fact that the locality of the Method Public Library is the only public library in the city.

581
00:47:32,018 --> 00:47:35,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Many, many years ago, you had community-based area libraries.

582
00:47:36,141 --> 00:47:41,984
[SPEAKER_02]: The high school library is closed on the weekends and nighttime, so the only library that you really have left is the Method Public Library.

583
00:47:42,765 --> 00:47:49,129
[SPEAKER_02]: And for years, they had cut back hours on their employees, which cut back the hours of operations, if I think a few folks remember.

584
00:47:49,837 --> 00:47:53,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the days and the hours at night and on the weekends were cut back.

585
00:47:54,821 --> 00:48:07,191
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things I forgot to mention when the last lady was up here speaking, I did get a complaint from a lady who went to the Method Public Library to return a book, to run in and to run out, and she got a $25 ticket to bring her book.

586
00:48:07,771 --> 00:48:19,200
[SPEAKER_02]: And this takes us right back to what you had addressed a long time ago, Councilor Marks, I mean, where is this 30-minute supposedly free time you have when you pull up and getting ready to use these meters and what have you?

587
00:48:19,655 --> 00:48:26,997
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why it's taken the Traffic Commission so long, but again, it was just as bad as putting it in front of the church when they first started this thing and they had to take them out.

588
00:48:27,517 --> 00:48:31,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would you put something in front of a public library, an educational building, a community building?

589
00:48:32,698 --> 00:48:33,738
[SPEAKER_02]: It just doesn't make any sense.

590
00:48:33,798 --> 00:48:39,380
[SPEAKER_02]: But on the topic itself, it just makes... Report of information, Councilor Camuso.

591
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:49,262
[SPEAKER_15]: The library has a parking lot directly adjacent to the building, and I drive through that street quite frequently, and it butts it directly.

592
00:48:49,767 --> 00:48:51,368
[SPEAKER_15]: There's always available spots in there.

593
00:48:52,408 --> 00:48:53,449
[SPEAKER_15]: Just a point of information.

594
00:48:54,229 --> 00:48:54,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor.

595
00:48:55,290 --> 00:49:02,353
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact of the matter is this lady just pulled up in the front of the house to go in and just drop off a book, and she didn't need to get a $25 ticket.

596
00:49:03,093 --> 00:49:06,395
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we all remember a few months ago, when there was a funeral going on at St.

597
00:49:06,415 --> 00:49:10,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Joseph's Church, quite a few people got tickets there, and they had to be retaken back.

598
00:49:10,497 --> 00:49:16,500
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, it's just part of the whole program that really needs to be revisited, if not completely dumped.

599
00:49:18,711 --> 00:49:20,431
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor, Madam Vice President.

600
00:49:20,671 --> 00:49:22,112
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

601
00:49:22,132 --> 00:49:32,974
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to go on the record in support of Councilor Caraviello's resolve, along with your amendment, to get a list, a breakdown of what was spent on the bathrooms last year.

602
00:49:33,594 --> 00:49:40,235
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's something we don't know, and I think that's something we all would challenge, that $10,000 was actually put into the bathrooms.

603
00:49:41,175 --> 00:49:44,376
[SPEAKER_09]: It's upsetting because it's a public building where your children are going to

604
00:49:44,817 --> 00:49:50,799
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, read and take out books from the library, they should at least be able to have a place to go to the bathroom.

605
00:49:51,399 --> 00:50:04,884
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it correlates with a resolution you had on the agenda last week or the week before, Councilor Penta, with regards to jobs just being, $90,000 jobs being created and people getting raises of $20,000.

606
00:50:04,924 --> 00:50:07,245
[SPEAKER_09]: We heard recently of a 5% raise that, you know, took place and it just,

607
00:50:14,124 --> 00:50:22,166
[SPEAKER_09]: makes you stop and think, like, maybe we should take care and maintain the buildings we have before we go hire additional personnel to work in them.

608
00:50:24,107 --> 00:50:30,169
[SPEAKER_09]: We, in the council, fight year after year, project after project for maintenance accounts, maintenance fees.

609
00:50:30,649 --> 00:50:38,151
[SPEAKER_09]: And we, Councilor Marks, you know, fought hard, you know, with our help, obviously, to get $10,000 for the bathrooms to be replaced.

610
00:50:38,591 --> 00:50:40,331
[SPEAKER_09]: And we spoke about it last year.

611
00:50:40,351 --> 00:50:41,972
[SPEAKER_09]: There are people that would volunteer.

612
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:43,801
[SPEAKER_09]: So I mean, it is upsetting.

613
00:50:43,841 --> 00:50:50,084
[SPEAKER_09]: It's hard to handle how the city is operated and how the city spends money.

614
00:50:50,584 --> 00:50:56,007
[SPEAKER_09]: Because something like that, whether or not to do the library over, obviously, is a huge decision.

615
00:50:56,087 --> 00:50:59,008
[SPEAKER_09]: And the police department has to come into account.

616
00:50:59,168 --> 00:51:08,513
[SPEAKER_09]: But to get facilities and to be able to fight for $10,000 and then nothing changed, nothing happened, it's almost like, what are we doing week after week?

617
00:51:08,803 --> 00:51:10,083
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, voice in our opinions.

618
00:51:10,103 --> 00:51:14,224
[SPEAKER_09]: We talked about the library bathroom six times, seven times.

619
00:51:14,904 --> 00:51:16,624
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's just completely unfortunate.

620
00:51:16,744 --> 00:51:22,225
[SPEAKER_09]: And I, you know, that's one of the many things, obviously, that upset me with regards to how money's spent.

621
00:51:22,425 --> 00:51:26,826
[SPEAKER_09]: But I would, I agree, we need, I would love to see an accounting and where the money went.

622
00:51:28,446 --> 00:51:29,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

623
00:51:30,447 --> 00:51:31,107
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Marks.

624
00:51:32,027 --> 00:51:32,967
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

625
00:51:32,987 --> 00:51:38,428
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to thank Councilor Caraviello for offering this resolve tonight and my colleagues for their comments.

626
00:51:39,884 --> 00:52:03,161
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, the article I read in the paper, you know, mentioned the library director, Brian Boutelier, and I remember the last several budgets when we sat in, like we do with all the department heads, and when we asked the question of the director of the library, what are your needs for the library, he said, at this time, I don't have any.

627
00:52:04,761 --> 00:52:07,182
[SPEAKER_11]: pointed the question about the restrooms.

628
00:52:07,883 --> 00:52:12,206
[SPEAKER_11]: And I likened them to prison bathrooms.

629
00:52:12,746 --> 00:52:16,748
[SPEAKER_11]: And he said he doesn't see anything wrong with the bathrooms at the public library.

630
00:52:17,449 --> 00:52:32,398
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that's part of the problem we're seeing is the attitude, to be quite honest with you, from the director himself on the condition of the building and the inability to stand up on behalf of the library, which is his job.

631
00:52:34,989 --> 00:52:37,111
[SPEAKER_11]: fight for what's needed within that library.

632
00:52:37,391 --> 00:52:40,615
[SPEAKER_11]: We were told last week they're down a children's position.

633
00:52:40,655 --> 00:52:42,917
[SPEAKER_11]: We were told they're down a reference librarian.

634
00:52:43,257 --> 00:52:47,762
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight just mentioned about the fact that we may lose certification.

635
00:52:47,802 --> 00:52:51,265
[SPEAKER_11]: We're about a quarter of a million dollars away from certification.

636
00:52:51,866 --> 00:52:58,472
[SPEAKER_11]: The last, the Mass Board of Library Commissioners, Mr. President, without their certification,

637
00:52:58,902 --> 00:53:05,128
[SPEAKER_11]: We could lose network subscriptions, database, and interlibrary loans.

638
00:53:05,549 --> 00:53:13,958
[SPEAKER_11]: We could lose the ability for Method residents to use their Minuteman card and go to any other library in the Minuteman network.

639
00:53:14,919 --> 00:53:18,022
[SPEAKER_11]: I hear a lot of people say, well, I go to Lexington or I go to Arlington.

640
00:53:18,562 --> 00:53:21,065
[SPEAKER_11]: And the fact that we may be on an island

641
00:53:21,512 --> 00:53:27,937
[SPEAKER_11]: because we refuse to put in the necessary funds to fund our library.

642
00:53:28,377 --> 00:53:34,101
[SPEAKER_11]: I would say you go to that library at any given time, Mr. President, you'll see people in all the different sections.

643
00:53:34,522 --> 00:53:36,743
[SPEAKER_11]: The library is highly utilized.

644
00:53:37,384 --> 00:53:42,688
[SPEAKER_11]: And even based on the current offerings it has, it's still an attraction in this community.

645
00:53:43,348 --> 00:53:47,231
[SPEAKER_11]: And yes, things are changing and things are going more electronic and so forth.

646
00:53:47,291 --> 00:53:48,032
[SPEAKER_11]: I understand that.

647
00:53:48,907 --> 00:54:00,653
[SPEAKER_11]: There's ways, like the town of Watertown, who just built a library a few years ago, state of the art library, is attracting people back to the library, different offerings back in the library.

648
00:54:00,934 --> 00:54:08,297
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a community room in the library, in my opinion, that's underutilized and could be a much larger asset.

649
00:54:08,618 --> 00:54:13,080
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Caraviello mentioned on many occasions about adding a second floor onto the library.

650
00:54:13,453 --> 00:54:17,737
[SPEAKER_11]: and creating some type of community room or function room up there.

651
00:54:18,738 --> 00:54:29,987
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, there's a host of things we can do with this library, but one thing we can no longer do is to underfund the library, keep on getting a waiver from the state.

652
00:54:30,568 --> 00:54:35,632
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, from what I was told by a state representative, that waiver is supposed to be a one-time thing.

653
00:54:36,153 --> 00:54:40,076
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, Method, you couldn't reach the funding this year for whatever circumstance.

654
00:54:40,436 --> 00:54:41,177
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's a waiver.

655
00:54:41,715 --> 00:54:43,836
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll keep you in the network.

656
00:54:44,136 --> 00:54:45,337
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll keep the funding coming.

657
00:54:45,597 --> 00:54:46,477
[SPEAKER_11]: But here's your waiver."

658
00:54:46,758 --> 00:54:51,820
[SPEAKER_11]: But to get a waiver year after year after year is an injustice, Mr. President.

659
00:54:52,100 --> 00:55:07,749
[SPEAKER_11]: And the state legislature should have never allowed that within their legislation, to allow a community to use that as a crutch to say, you know what, we're no longer going to fund our library and we don't care because we got a waiver from the state saying we can do so.

660
00:55:08,329 --> 00:55:10,350
[SPEAKER_11]: That wasn't the intent of the legislature.

661
00:55:11,363 --> 00:55:13,485
[SPEAKER_11]: the legislation that was filed by the legislature.

662
00:55:14,045 --> 00:55:24,933
[SPEAKER_11]: And Method, from what I read in the article, was one of just a few communities that has received a waiver, or multiple waivers, in the last several years.

663
00:55:25,654 --> 00:55:32,459
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, we're falling short of the mark here, and it's quite disturbing, because I wish I could tell residents, you know what?

664
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:37,022
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not putting the money into the library, but we're putting it into our police station.

665
00:55:37,757 --> 00:55:39,199
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not the case, Mr. President.

666
00:55:39,639 --> 00:55:41,261
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not putting the money into the library.

667
00:55:41,281 --> 00:55:42,442
[SPEAKER_11]: We're putting it into City Hall.

668
00:55:42,823 --> 00:55:44,545
[SPEAKER_11]: Go into any one of these restrooms up here.

669
00:55:44,765 --> 00:55:46,047
[SPEAKER_11]: They're in deplorable condition.

670
00:55:46,327 --> 00:55:50,051
[SPEAKER_11]: There's yellow crime tape around the urinals that you can't use.

671
00:55:50,492 --> 00:55:52,274
[SPEAKER_11]: The sinks don't work, Mr. President.

672
00:55:52,653 --> 00:55:53,573
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a disgrace.

673
00:55:54,133 --> 00:56:01,315
[SPEAKER_11]: The hand sanitizers, the minute they put the hand sanitizer dispensers around the building, within three weeks, they were gone.

674
00:56:01,355 --> 00:56:04,756
[SPEAKER_11]: There was nothing left in them, and they haven't been replaced, Mr. President.

675
00:56:05,577 --> 00:56:07,837
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just, you know, it's amazing.

676
00:56:07,897 --> 00:56:13,859
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I wish I could tell people we're taking our money and utilizing it somewhere else, but that's not the case.

677
00:56:14,619 --> 00:56:17,300
[SPEAKER_11]: And the taxes, as people mentioned, keep on going up.

678
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:22,101
[SPEAKER_11]: The buildings, the infrastructure is crumbling, and we really have very little to show.

679
00:56:22,791 --> 00:56:34,256
[SPEAKER_11]: And I agree with Councilor Caraviello that, you know, I think we did receive an itemized listing a while back.

680
00:56:34,316 --> 00:56:39,499
[SPEAKER_11]: Because what originally happened was this whole council voted unanimously for $10,000 in the budget.

681
00:56:39,519 --> 00:56:42,020
[SPEAKER_11]: And the administration was kind enough to put it in there.

682
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:45,861
[SPEAKER_11]: The air conditioning went within the public library.

683
00:56:46,722 --> 00:56:49,143
[SPEAKER_11]: And they used the $10,000 towards the air conditioning.

684
00:56:50,168 --> 00:56:54,930
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, I'm not going to dispute that if they thought that was more of a priority than fixing the restrooms.

685
00:56:55,451 --> 00:56:58,872
[SPEAKER_11]: They did find more funding in the budget to do the restrooms.

686
00:56:59,673 --> 00:57:10,138
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, Mr. President, I'm not going to want to speak out, but let me tell you, Mr. President, I don't know if anyone watched the movie, The Jerk, with Steve Mott.

687
00:57:11,759 --> 00:57:12,899
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a movie from years ago.

688
00:57:13,659 --> 00:57:18,142
[SPEAKER_11]: He ran into millions of dollars, the jerk, and he lived in a little shack.

689
00:57:19,112 --> 00:57:21,134
[SPEAKER_11]: And with that millions of dollars, you know what he did?

690
00:57:21,474 --> 00:57:22,556
[SPEAKER_11]: He built a bigger shack.

691
00:57:24,117 --> 00:57:27,200
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's what we did in the library bathrooms.

692
00:57:27,881 --> 00:57:41,655
[SPEAKER_11]: We went from a deplorable bathroom with deplorable tiles and fixtures and everything else, to now a deplorable bathroom with a new sink, the same old tiles, dirty tiles, the same old crummy doors.

693
00:57:42,692 --> 00:57:45,653
[SPEAKER_11]: The same old prison style, Mr. President.

694
00:57:45,993 --> 00:57:47,273
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's going to be the showcase.

695
00:57:47,473 --> 00:57:52,874
[SPEAKER_11]: When people from other communities come to our library, they walk in the restroom, they must be saying, where am I?

696
00:57:53,514 --> 00:57:56,375
[SPEAKER_11]: My seat adjunction, where am I?

697
00:57:57,655 --> 00:57:59,396
[SPEAKER_11]: What's going on, Mr. President?

698
00:58:00,876 --> 00:58:04,637
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I just don't know what's happening, Mr. President.

699
00:58:04,657 --> 00:58:08,958
[SPEAKER_11]: But again, in this year's budget, I hope we all sit down and we have our deliberations.

700
00:58:09,385 --> 00:58:13,206
[SPEAKER_11]: And when the director comes before us and say, you know what, I'm fine.

701
00:58:13,246 --> 00:58:14,666
[SPEAKER_11]: Everything's running fine in here.

702
00:58:14,986 --> 00:58:17,847
[SPEAKER_11]: I have half the staff, but you know, we make ends meet.

703
00:58:18,607 --> 00:58:21,428
[SPEAKER_11]: My budget for maintenance has gone down, but we make ends meet.

704
00:58:22,748 --> 00:58:26,949
[SPEAKER_11]: And we should all in one voice say, Mr. Boutelier, you're not making ends meet.

705
00:58:27,409 --> 00:58:28,989
[SPEAKER_11]: Your library is falling apart.

706
00:58:29,289 --> 00:58:30,910
[SPEAKER_11]: Open your eyes, Mr. Boutelier.

707
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:32,250
[SPEAKER_11]: Open your eyes.

708
00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:35,571
[SPEAKER_07]: If I could just from the chair,

709
00:58:36,554 --> 00:58:42,896
[SPEAKER_07]: In defense of someone who's not here to speak for himself, my experience with the librarian is that he's very much concerned.

710
00:58:43,397 --> 00:58:51,560
[SPEAKER_07]: Medford's at a crossroads now that we have the opportunity to elect new leadership, and we'll do that, and I think we'll see some adjustments.

711
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:56,341
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, just if I could, a department head is not here just to collect a $110,000 salary.

712
00:58:58,464 --> 00:59:16,200
[SPEAKER_11]: A department head is there to do the people's business and to make sure whatever they're in charge of is kept up, Mr. President, and that they're the biggest advocate, the biggest advocate, and not playing second fiddle, saying, well, politically, I don't want to say anything because I don't want to jeopardize my job.

713
00:59:16,741 --> 00:59:20,024
[SPEAKER_11]: That is not what a department head should be, Mr. President.

714
00:59:21,305 --> 00:59:24,808
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't think I'm throwing anyone under the bus, Mr. President, because I feel strongly

715
00:59:25,208 --> 00:59:33,470
[SPEAKER_11]: meeting with this particular department head over the last several years and hearing his answers year after year after year to our questions, that everything is fine.

716
00:59:34,010 --> 00:59:43,672
[SPEAKER_11]: So I, I, I, I don't feel like I'm speaking out of turn here and I look forward to this budget session, Mr. President, and maybe we'll get a different outcome from the department head.

717
00:59:44,292 --> 00:59:44,592
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

718
00:59:44,612 --> 00:59:45,232
[SPEAKER_10]: Counsel Max.

719
00:59:45,292 --> 00:59:46,092
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Carfiello.

720
00:59:46,332 --> 00:59:47,052
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

721
00:59:47,533 --> 00:59:49,533
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, you know, if you go on the state website,

722
00:59:50,955 --> 00:59:57,539
[SPEAKER_10]: There's been a grant system there for rebuilding of the libraries and renovating the libraries for the last two to three years.

723
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:01,001
[SPEAKER_10]: And I called up and asked, and we've never applied for the funds.

724
01:00:01,541 --> 01:00:05,824
[SPEAKER_10]: So there was funds out there available, but if you don't ask, you can never get them.

725
01:00:07,825 --> 01:00:12,848
[SPEAKER_10]: We finally hired a top flight children's librarian.

726
01:00:13,670 --> 01:00:20,134
[SPEAKER_10]: And the kids are assigned to go back there, and we have nothing to offer them when they go back there.

727
01:00:20,674 --> 01:00:22,375
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to update that.

728
01:00:22,855 --> 01:00:27,138
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, again, even some minor improvements would be a help there.

729
01:00:27,418 --> 01:00:34,802
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, on the last two budgets, I asked the librarian, I says, you know, where do you see the library in five years?

730
01:00:34,882 --> 01:00:38,004
[SPEAKER_10]: And didn't get an answer on either time.

731
01:00:39,286 --> 01:00:40,666
[SPEAKER_10]: No, there's no five-year plan.

732
01:00:40,706 --> 01:00:43,307
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why we're not getting any money, because we don't have a plan.

733
01:00:44,888 --> 01:00:46,788
[SPEAKER_10]: People aren't going to just throw money at you anymore.

734
01:00:46,828 --> 01:00:47,549
[SPEAKER_10]: Those days are over.

735
01:00:48,589 --> 01:00:49,369
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to get out there.

736
01:00:49,389 --> 01:00:50,189
[SPEAKER_10]: You've got to do some work.

737
01:00:50,209 --> 01:00:51,310
[SPEAKER_10]: You've got to be creative.

738
01:00:51,330 --> 01:00:53,170
[SPEAKER_10]: You've got to go out there and find your money.

739
01:00:53,471 --> 01:00:54,891
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's been money out there available.

740
01:00:55,791 --> 01:01:00,093
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of dried up now, but you let it sit there for three or four years, and you never went after it.

741
01:01:01,193 --> 01:01:02,974
[SPEAKER_10]: So again, I agree with Councilor Marks.

742
01:01:03,754 --> 01:01:07,215
[SPEAKER_10]: This year, when the budget time comes, and he says everything is hunky-dory.

743
01:01:08,669 --> 01:01:12,510
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we all better sit there and question him a lot harder than we did last time.

744
01:01:13,371 --> 01:01:13,691
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

745
01:01:13,731 --> 01:01:16,732
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the motion of Councilor Caraviello as amended.

746
01:01:17,752 --> 01:01:19,773
[SPEAKER_07]: Sir, please state your name and address for the record.

747
01:01:20,053 --> 01:01:20,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening.

748
01:01:20,913 --> 01:01:32,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Anthony D'Antonio, 12 Yale street Medford through the chair for Councilor Caraviello, uh, February 11th, 2014, we issued a check for $9,694 for fixtures.

749
01:01:33,057 --> 01:01:34,618
[SPEAKER_03]: And who do we buy these from Liberace?

750
01:01:34,978 --> 01:01:35,478
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, really?

751
01:01:36,310 --> 01:01:37,110
[SPEAKER_03]: What do we have?

752
01:01:38,051 --> 01:01:38,691
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a disgrace.

753
01:01:38,811 --> 01:01:39,391
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with you.

754
01:01:39,491 --> 01:01:39,951
[SPEAKER_03]: I was there.

755
01:01:40,011 --> 01:01:41,012
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw it.

756
01:01:41,052 --> 01:01:42,252
[SPEAKER_03]: The library is a disgrace.

757
01:01:44,593 --> 01:01:46,514
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a suggestion, though, because not all is lost.

758
01:01:48,734 --> 01:01:56,117
[SPEAKER_03]: In the budget, when you go and look at the budget this year, we have two assistant superintendents making $112,000 each.

759
01:01:58,018 --> 01:02:01,839
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to see it just justify one assistant superintendent, let alone two.

760
01:02:02,379 --> 01:02:04,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's take that money and reallocate it somewhere.

761
01:02:05,832 --> 01:02:12,477
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got to get some people in there that know what to do with the numbers, because this city needs to get back up on top.

762
01:02:12,857 --> 01:02:15,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Tired of watching it go one rung below, another rung, another rung.

763
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:17,621
[SPEAKER_03]: So do the best you can on that, please.

764
01:02:17,641 --> 01:02:18,301
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate it.

765
01:02:18,341 --> 01:02:18,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

766
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:20,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

767
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:24,446
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the motion of Councilor Caraviello, as amended, all those in favor?

768
01:02:24,466 --> 01:02:25,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

769
01:02:26,267 --> 01:02:26,988
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

770
01:02:27,008 --> 01:02:28,669
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion carries.

771
01:02:28,849 --> 01:02:29,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

772
01:02:29,930 --> 01:02:35,034
[SPEAKER_07]: When I made my public service announcement earlier in the meeting, I may have misspoken.

773
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:38,141
[SPEAKER_07]: So on Friday, May 29th at 9 a.m.

774
01:02:38,181 --> 01:02:43,162
[SPEAKER_07]: at the Immaculate Conception Church, the Medford Police Memorial Mass will be offered.

775
01:02:43,862 --> 01:02:44,262
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

776
01:02:44,282 --> 01:02:48,823
[SPEAKER_07]: 15-494 offered by Councilor Penta.

777
01:02:49,763 --> 01:02:58,005
[SPEAKER_07]: Be it resolved that the lack of important information not provided to this council regarding the Craddock Bridge be discussed.

778
01:02:58,566 --> 01:02:59,226
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Penta.

779
01:02:59,586 --> 01:03:04,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, but more importantly, anybody who might be watching and Medford Square business folks,

780
01:03:05,254 --> 01:03:09,016
[SPEAKER_02]: The situation regarding the Karatek Bridge is just an ongoing tale.

781
01:03:09,396 --> 01:03:16,580
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's time to maybe have a little bit of a history lesson here as it relates to how did we get to the position we're in right now.

782
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:23,243
[SPEAKER_02]: We can go back to 2002, 02-2002-526, offered by Council Longo.

783
01:03:23,423 --> 01:03:27,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Be it resolved that the Karatek Bridge be discussed in regards to public safety.

784
01:03:28,545 --> 01:03:30,786
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was a whole host of amendments as it related to that.

785
01:03:30,826 --> 01:03:31,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that was in 2002, 13 years ago.

786
01:03:34,935 --> 01:03:37,056
[SPEAKER_02]: First response from the state came back in 2006.

787
01:03:37,116 --> 01:03:46,682
[SPEAKER_02]: They first sent a note back that basically says that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts will be taking a look and to review it.

788
01:03:47,763 --> 01:03:48,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we go to 2011.

789
01:03:49,364 --> 01:03:55,848
[SPEAKER_02]: From 2006 to 2011, there was absolutely nothing that took place that revolved around that particular bridge.

790
01:03:56,628 --> 01:04:00,651
[SPEAKER_02]: At that point in time in 2011, they said the cost of the bridge was going to be $2.5 million.

791
01:04:00,671 --> 01:04:01,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Then in August of 2012,

792
01:04:05,144 --> 01:04:06,664
[SPEAKER_02]: it jumped to $8.5 million.

793
01:04:06,925 --> 01:04:12,846
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in April of 2013, it jumped up to $12.7 million.

794
01:04:13,147 --> 01:04:23,650
[SPEAKER_02]: And at that meeting on April 13, on April, excuse me, of 2013, I had asked the question as it relates to mitigation for our downtown Medford business folks.

795
01:04:24,310 --> 01:04:26,011
[SPEAKER_02]: The council voted seven to nothing on that.

796
01:04:26,291 --> 01:04:30,432
[SPEAKER_02]: As a matter of fact, we got a letter of support from the Medford Chamber of Commerce on that particular issue.

797
01:04:31,692 --> 01:04:36,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Sent the letter to the mayor and to the state, and to this date, still, absolutely nothing has come back.

798
01:04:37,095 --> 01:04:39,316
[SPEAKER_02]: From April, we sent it again in May of 2013.

799
01:04:41,077 --> 01:04:46,959
[SPEAKER_02]: June of 2013, the cost then went down to $10.7 million.

800
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:55,503
[SPEAKER_02]: And now, again, on February of 2014, the question of mitigation came up, it was presented, and we still have no answer to that.

801
01:04:56,344 --> 01:04:58,485
[SPEAKER_02]: All we know right now that we're getting a bridge

802
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:03,797
[SPEAKER_02]: that supposedly are going to be starting at this point in time, sometime this summer.

803
01:05:05,037 --> 01:05:12,680
[SPEAKER_02]: And what doesn't make sense now, they're saying that on November 4th of 2018, the bridge will be completed.

804
01:05:14,121 --> 01:05:20,063
[SPEAKER_02]: But during the summer of 2018, the bridge will be open for use.

805
01:05:21,023 --> 01:05:27,746
[SPEAKER_02]: So how can you have something not completed and open for use or be completed in November of 2018?

806
01:05:29,187 --> 01:05:38,610
[SPEAKER_02]: And that cost now is projected at $10.78 million for this particular bridge.

807
01:05:39,350 --> 01:05:51,394
[SPEAKER_02]: We've seen all kinds of correspondence from representatives in our city who are saying this is a wonderful thing, dating back to 2006, to 2012, to 2013.

808
01:05:52,654 --> 01:05:58,596
[SPEAKER_02]: We've received press releases from the mayor, from the senator in this community, that this bridge is such a wonderful thing.

809
01:05:58,878 --> 01:06:05,343
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they built the tunnel from France to England, which was, I believe, 21 miles in less than nine years.

810
01:06:06,244 --> 01:06:15,190
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have a bridge here starting in 2015 to be included by 2018, that's three years, to go 121 feet.

811
01:06:17,712 --> 01:06:23,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Think about it, 121 feet when you built the tunnel, which was 21 miles, and it was underwater.

812
01:06:24,457 --> 01:06:28,020
[SPEAKER_02]: This whole thing, as far as I'm concerned, is the biggest slap in the face

813
01:06:28,356 --> 01:06:29,616
[SPEAKER_02]: to the Medford business community.

814
01:06:30,197 --> 01:06:33,718
[SPEAKER_02]: And the sad part about it, one of the gentlemen who's in charge of this project lives in the city of Medford.

815
01:06:34,958 --> 01:06:44,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Councilor Dello Russo, I'm calling you on the carpet tonight because you indicated that you'd never received the letter dated February 24th, for which your name is on here.

816
01:06:44,582 --> 01:06:52,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Every single one of our reps, our senators, our state, Paul Geer, Cassandra upstairs in the engineer's office.

817
01:06:53,225 --> 01:06:57,086
[SPEAKER_02]: And I accepted you for your comment saying that you couldn't find it in your file.

818
01:06:59,203 --> 01:07:05,345
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was convenient for you last week to get Eversource here just like that, when the conditions of the streets might be taking place.

819
01:07:06,785 --> 01:07:13,227
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, this council has been asking, asking for you to go forward and call for this meeting.

820
01:07:14,428 --> 01:07:15,568
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is no meeting here.

821
01:07:16,248 --> 01:07:21,750
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are public notices out there, and there are stanchions out there indicating that the bridge is going to start this summer.

822
01:07:23,253 --> 01:07:25,154
[SPEAKER_02]: So what clout you have, I don't know.

823
01:07:25,574 --> 01:07:27,255
[SPEAKER_02]: What clout this city has, I don't know.

824
01:07:28,075 --> 01:07:41,500
[SPEAKER_02]: But the more important part of where the clout all lies is this city council should be holding somebody to be accountable for the mitigation process that needs to take place on this, because businesses are going to be hurt, and some people might even go out of business.

825
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:51,164
[SPEAKER_02]: It's absolutely unfair that this project is going to start in the summer of 2015 and not be completed until November of 2018.

826
01:07:54,470 --> 01:08:02,953
[SPEAKER_15]: On my first point is you had Eversource here as a result of Councilor Marks bringing the issue forward.

827
01:08:03,753 --> 01:08:05,074
[SPEAKER_15]: So I applaud you for that.

828
01:08:06,835 --> 01:08:14,237
[SPEAKER_15]: And my second point of information is we did have representatives from the bridge here about a year ago, I believe.

829
01:08:14,257 --> 01:08:15,978
[SPEAKER_15]: Twice in six months.

830
01:08:16,778 --> 01:08:17,118
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct.

831
01:08:17,418 --> 01:08:22,940
[SPEAKER_15]: And at that point they stated that there won't be any mitigation to businesses.

832
01:08:24,728 --> 01:08:27,869
[SPEAKER_15]: even though this council did ask for it, they clearly stated that.

833
01:08:28,449 --> 01:08:30,549
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I don't want businesses to think otherwise.

834
01:08:31,250 --> 01:08:38,051
[SPEAKER_02]: With all due respect to my council colleague, that may be your interpretation, but nothing was ever definitively signed or put in writing.

835
01:08:38,071 --> 01:08:41,052
[SPEAKER_02]: This council asked to have that put in the RFP that went out there.

836
01:08:41,392 --> 01:08:45,193
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are four people, there are four components to the people who are bidding on that bridge, number one.

837
01:08:45,433 --> 01:08:54,435
[SPEAKER_02]: This council asked that they come here and they apprise the city, the council, and the business community, and the Office of Community Development as it relates to the progress of that bridge.

838
01:08:54,898 --> 01:08:55,579
[SPEAKER_02]: and they never did it.

839
01:08:56,079 --> 01:09:08,112
[SPEAKER_02]: The only meeting that they ever had was, I believe, some three weeks ago at 10 o'clock on a Wednesday morning, for which certain councils couldn't go, a lot of people couldn't go, and it was just their staff meeting, if you want to come and see what it's all about.

840
01:09:08,793 --> 01:09:14,358
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they send you a press release, for which is put in the paper, that basically tells you that this is not going to be completed until 2018.

841
01:09:16,822 --> 01:09:26,250
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you forget all the gibberish that gets around to 2018, and then they acknowledge that the footings of the bridge, which have been there for 100 plus years, all they're going to do is reshore them up.

842
01:09:26,490 --> 01:09:27,932
[SPEAKER_02]: That bridge is not sunk at all.

843
01:09:28,632 --> 01:09:31,074
[SPEAKER_02]: And what they think they're building, the Taj Mahal, I don't know.

844
01:09:31,835 --> 01:09:35,318
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't need to build the Longfellow Bridge like they're building in Washington.

845
01:09:35,578 --> 01:09:38,481
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a very simple bridge of 121 feet.

846
01:09:39,442 --> 01:09:43,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, you want to make it adaptable for people, sidewalks and bikes, go right ahead.

847
01:09:43,667 --> 01:09:53,870
[SPEAKER_02]: But with the art of technology that's out there today, and for them to tell you it's going to take you a well over a year just to figure out what's underneath the bridge and move the lines and this and that, that is absolutely absurd.

848
01:09:54,450 --> 01:09:55,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely absurd.

849
01:09:55,490 --> 01:10:01,832
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably the biggest snow job that this council and this city has gotten from the State Department of Public Transportation.

850
01:10:02,452 --> 01:10:09,734
[SPEAKER_02]: And we haven't even gotten to the issue of the bus routes and the changing of the bus routes and what's going to happen after that and once this bridge goes into construction.

851
01:10:10,597 --> 01:10:14,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, I'm asking once again, I'm asking you to call the Mass.

852
01:10:14,178 --> 01:10:22,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Department of Transportation, have them come before this council, and have them explain if what Councilor Camuso was saying is correct, that they are not going to give us mitigation.

853
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:23,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Point of information?

854
01:10:24,261 --> 01:10:27,682
[SPEAKER_02]: Point of information, Councilor Camuso.

855
01:10:27,882 --> 01:10:33,723
[SPEAKER_15]: That was the Department of Transportation representatives that were here meeting with this city council.

856
01:10:33,783 --> 01:10:40,265
[SPEAKER_15]: Clearly stated that the state does not pay mitigation on projects, but what they do do

857
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:47,264
[SPEAKER_15]: is pay for any damages to any public or private entities that are damaged as a result.

858
01:10:48,125 --> 01:10:48,946
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a big difference.

859
01:10:49,406 --> 01:10:51,828
[SPEAKER_15]: Mitigation and physical damage.

860
01:10:52,508 --> 01:10:57,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm going to respectfully disagree with my colleague because state agencies and state departments do pay mitigation.

861
01:10:57,611 --> 01:10:59,213
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they're asked to do it, they do do it.

862
01:10:59,713 --> 01:11:01,734
[SPEAKER_02]: The biggest one out there right now is the MWRA.

863
01:11:02,014 --> 01:11:06,998
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll give you mitigation before they even start a project because they have to realize the length and the strength of their pipes.

864
01:11:09,376 --> 01:11:13,798
[SPEAKER_15]: We can throw out the red herring, say an MWRA or any other agency he wants to.

865
01:11:14,399 --> 01:11:17,040
[SPEAKER_15]: They are not a state agency.

866
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:19,862
[SPEAKER_15]: The MWRA is a separate and distinct authority.

867
01:11:20,402 --> 01:11:21,743
[SPEAKER_15]: It's an authority like Massport.

868
01:11:21,803 --> 01:11:23,383
[SPEAKER_15]: It's an authority like the MBTA.

869
01:11:23,844 --> 01:11:26,005
[SPEAKER_15]: Their rules, their laws are different.

870
01:11:26,838 --> 01:11:29,279
[SPEAKER_15]: The Department of Transportation clearly stated this to us.

871
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:30,840
[SPEAKER_15]: They said it right here.

872
01:11:30,860 --> 01:11:34,142
[SPEAKER_15]: If we have to go back, rewind the tape, maybe the council forgot what they said.

873
01:11:34,542 --> 01:11:37,923
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not responsible for what he remembers, but I'm responsible for what happened here.

874
01:11:38,284 --> 01:11:39,564
[SPEAKER_15]: And that is clearly what was said.

875
01:11:39,884 --> 01:11:43,286
[SPEAKER_15]: The state does not pay mitigation on public projects.

876
01:11:44,267 --> 01:11:45,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm responsible for what I know.

877
01:11:45,707 --> 01:11:55,452
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I know is this, that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts does and can, if the city of Medford is going to be impacted to such a degree and businesses are going to be displaced for a period of time such as that,

878
01:11:55,791 --> 01:12:08,186
[SPEAKER_02]: When you have your own Chamber of Commerce, and when you have an entire city council, and when you've been talking about this since 2013, and went out since 2015, and there is nothing, no acknowledgement, no public hearing, no public meeting,

879
01:12:08,536 --> 01:12:09,156
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a disgrace.

880
01:12:09,556 --> 01:12:17,077
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you think they're doing a good job by taking this bridge over and cutting down the amount of time that it's going to take, or not to take, it's wrong.

881
01:12:17,138 --> 01:12:17,638
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not right.

882
01:12:17,998 --> 01:12:18,658
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not right.

883
01:12:19,198 --> 01:12:23,319
[SPEAKER_02]: This does not speak well for a governmental project and a governmental agency.

884
01:12:23,359 --> 01:12:30,700
[SPEAKER_02]: And more importantly, how can you go and start with $2 million, go as high as $12 million, bring it back to $10 million?

885
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:33,200
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't even figure out what the actual cost is going to be.

886
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:36,741
[SPEAKER_02]: And the total disruption is going to be when they put that ramp in Medford Square,

887
01:12:37,672 --> 01:12:42,816
[SPEAKER_02]: and shutting off one of the ramps coming off Route 93, there's going to be a complete fiasco.

888
01:12:43,016 --> 01:12:44,938
[SPEAKER_02]: We still haven't seen the final product.

889
01:12:45,378 --> 01:12:50,162
[SPEAKER_02]: It still hasn't been presented to the business people, the Chamber of Commerce, or this council.

890
01:12:51,463 --> 01:12:55,507
[SPEAKER_02]: And that, to me, is what this whole system, this whole project is all about.

891
01:12:56,407 --> 01:12:58,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely no transparency at all.

892
01:13:00,511 --> 01:13:02,272
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, Councilor Camuso.

893
01:13:02,332 --> 01:13:02,632
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

894
01:13:03,822 --> 01:13:06,404
[SPEAKER_15]: to say that there was no public meetings, it's fiction.

895
01:13:06,845 --> 01:13:07,905
[SPEAKER_15]: It's fiction, once again.

896
01:13:08,246 --> 01:13:14,271
[SPEAKER_15]: We had a meeting here with the representatives from the Massachusetts Department of Transportation.

897
01:13:14,691 --> 01:13:18,354
[SPEAKER_15]: One of them's name was Donald Daly, and I don't remember the other gentleman's name.

898
01:13:20,036 --> 01:13:20,416
[SPEAKER_15]: What was it?

899
01:13:20,596 --> 01:13:21,016
[SPEAKER_15]: Paul King.

900
01:13:21,297 --> 01:13:21,797
[SPEAKER_15]: Paul King.

901
01:13:22,197 --> 01:13:25,540
[SPEAKER_15]: They were here at a 7 PM meeting of the Medford City Council.

902
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:26,241
[SPEAKER_15]: Twice.

903
01:13:26,261 --> 01:13:26,621
[SPEAKER_15]: Twice.

904
01:13:27,162 --> 01:13:27,462
[SPEAKER_15]: Twice.

905
01:13:27,742 --> 01:13:29,684
[SPEAKER_15]: So to sit here and say that there hasn't been public

906
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:41,022
[SPEAKER_02]: The meeting took place on the 18th of July, 2013, and it took place at the Century Bank and Trust on Mystic Avenue.

907
01:13:41,442 --> 01:13:43,963
[SPEAKER_02]: The time that came over here, his name was Billy something.

908
01:13:44,003 --> 01:13:46,924
[SPEAKER_02]: He appeared here from Medford and his other person.

909
01:13:47,924 --> 01:13:48,804
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what took place.

910
01:13:49,164 --> 01:13:51,545
[SPEAKER_02]: And that meeting, we were told, as a matter of fact,

911
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:58,743
[SPEAKER_02]: I have Mr. Davey's private personal number because at that particular night, in that particular meeting, they were trying to shut me off.

912
01:13:58,803 --> 01:14:06,967
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm asking him a very important question as to why this meeting was not being held here in Medford and where is the mitigation as it relates to the concern that we have.

913
01:14:07,027 --> 01:14:10,468
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not going to give us mitigation, what are you going to give for the business community?

914
01:14:10,689 --> 01:14:13,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't tell me you're going to pay for the disruption or the destruction to their product.

915
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:15,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course they would have to do that.

916
01:14:15,304 --> 01:14:16,545
[SPEAKER_02]: That's common sense tells you that.

917
01:14:16,985 --> 01:14:21,368
[SPEAKER_02]: But don't come in here and do a project and totally disrupt the entire community, the downtown area.

918
01:14:21,568 --> 01:14:24,129
[SPEAKER_02]: You have bus routes, you can have people completely confused.

919
01:14:24,630 --> 01:14:27,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Can anyone in this council turn around and explain what's going to go on?

920
01:14:27,932 --> 01:14:29,393
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you tell me where the bus routes are going to go?

921
01:14:29,413 --> 01:14:30,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Pardon me?

922
01:14:30,674 --> 01:14:31,574
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, yes.

923
01:14:32,055 --> 01:14:35,577
[SPEAKER_15]: The bus routes are going to go, the main bus route.

924
01:14:36,177 --> 01:14:40,320
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if the councillor took the time to reach out to the correct officials as I did,

925
01:14:40,653 --> 01:14:41,954
[SPEAKER_15]: but the bus route is going to be moved.

926
01:14:41,974 --> 01:14:43,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Point of clarification, point of clarification.

927
01:14:43,836 --> 01:14:45,057
[SPEAKER_02]: He wants to make representative to me.

928
01:14:45,437 --> 01:14:47,619
[SPEAKER_02]: My point is they belong before the public.

929
01:14:47,899 --> 01:14:50,961
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to do something and the public belongs to hear what's going on.

930
01:14:51,201 --> 01:14:52,482
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what the council called for.

931
01:14:52,643 --> 01:14:54,244
[SPEAKER_02]: If he wants to go on his own, good luck to him.

932
01:14:54,484 --> 01:14:55,705
[SPEAKER_02]: I want him to come before here.

933
01:14:55,945 --> 01:14:57,867
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a city of Medford project.

934
01:14:59,122 --> 01:15:16,125
[SPEAKER_15]: As I stated, if the councillor doesn't want to go over and above, as I have over my 16 years of public service, reaching out to the particular people that can make, rather than yelling and screaming in hot air, can actually make the bus stop moved, they are moving it across the river over near the bridge.

935
01:15:16,685 --> 01:15:24,846
[SPEAKER_15]: And hopefully it will be a permanent home even after the construction project with a nice greenery and maybe a bus shelter that Councilor Marks brought up before.

936
01:15:25,266 --> 01:15:28,647
[SPEAKER_15]: So I am doing some talks with the appropriate people.

937
01:15:29,114 --> 01:15:29,734
[SPEAKER_15]: That's number one.

938
01:15:30,035 --> 01:15:39,580
[SPEAKER_15]: Number two, I'm going to revert to a conversation I had with the councillor just a week ago, who was adamant about a former member of this council not bringing up the beer and wine.

939
01:15:40,581 --> 01:15:42,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Point of information, Mr. President.

940
01:15:42,882 --> 01:15:44,463
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got absolutely nothing to do with it.

941
01:15:44,483 --> 01:15:45,884
[SPEAKER_02]: He's talking about apples and oranges.

942
01:15:45,944 --> 01:15:47,685
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got nothing to do with this particular issue.

943
01:15:47,725 --> 01:15:49,606
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a pattern of your fictitious mind.

944
01:15:49,886 --> 01:15:50,847
[SPEAKER_02]: It's your fictitious mind.

945
01:15:51,667 --> 01:15:54,750
[SPEAKER_02]: This has nothing to do with this issue.

946
01:15:54,971 --> 01:15:56,713
[SPEAKER_15]: There's nothing to do with the issue.

947
01:15:56,733 --> 01:15:59,896
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to shoot for her, do it in the public.

948
01:16:00,076 --> 01:16:05,622
[SPEAKER_15]: As I started to say, Mr. President, earlier in his dissertation this evening, he said there was no public meetings.

949
01:16:05,923 --> 01:16:07,404
[SPEAKER_15]: In fact, there were two public meetings.

950
01:16:08,406 --> 01:16:09,947
[SPEAKER_15]: And the public meetings were in 2013.

951
01:16:09,987 --> 01:16:10,168
[SPEAKER_15]: This is 2015.

952
01:16:12,470 --> 01:16:31,141
[SPEAKER_15]: and we had one here at the Medford City Council, not in 2013, I will get you the exact date, but it was right here, the gentlemen were here, it was the first meeting, the first item agenda, I believe, and it was a very, very good meeting, and they emphatically stated, I mean, if you wanna make up the rules as you go along, like you've done a long time.

953
01:16:31,421 --> 01:16:33,603
[SPEAKER_02]: It's right here, Councilor, and it's right here.

954
01:16:33,623 --> 01:16:40,567
[SPEAKER_15]: As I said, Mr. President, if he wants to let people believe there's mitigation available and set people up for failure, that's his responsibility.

955
01:16:40,827 --> 01:16:43,368
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of information, Vice President Lundell-Curran.

956
01:16:44,128 --> 01:16:50,771
[SPEAKER_09]: I just, I believe one councilor's talking about a public meeting and one councilor's talking about a public hearing.

957
01:16:50,831 --> 01:16:56,934
[SPEAKER_09]: There was plenty of meetings, but I don't believe the state has had any public hearings.

958
01:16:56,994 --> 01:16:58,854
[SPEAKER_09]: They haven't declared any meetings.

959
01:16:58,874 --> 01:17:00,235
[SPEAKER_09]: They haven't notified neighbors.

960
01:17:00,275 --> 01:17:05,697
[SPEAKER_09]: They haven't notified businesses of a meeting where citizens and business owners can give their... There was one here today in this building.

961
01:17:05,737 --> 01:17:07,598
[SPEAKER_15]: There was one today that he didn't go to.

962
01:17:07,898 --> 01:17:09,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I didn't know about that one.

963
01:17:09,379 --> 01:17:10,219
[SPEAKER_15]: But, I mean...

964
01:17:10,924 --> 01:17:14,026
[SPEAKER_09]: A year ago, we had public hearings before the city council.

965
01:17:14,906 --> 01:17:20,410
[SPEAKER_09]: I never have known about one where the community has been notified to give their input of this project.

966
01:17:20,490 --> 01:17:32,997
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, because I agree, three years is going to detrimentally affect our Medford Square businesses to the point where maybe there'll be no mitigation, but there'll be claims in court against the state.

967
01:17:33,497 --> 01:17:37,179
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, and that's a given if you see a business go out

968
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:43,061
[SPEAKER_09]: go out of business and due to loss of income from, you know, the project that's going to take place.

969
01:17:43,161 --> 01:17:49,723
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um, I think both Councilors are making their points and have a right in their own different ways.

970
01:17:50,303 --> 01:17:51,844
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for your point of information.

971
01:17:51,984 --> 01:17:55,685
[SPEAKER_15]: So Mr. President, if I just can finish council, and I'll wrap it up.

972
01:17:55,765 --> 01:17:59,286
[SPEAKER_15]: I just, um, in council Lungo-Koehn is a hundred percent correct.

973
01:17:59,706 --> 01:18:07,168
[SPEAKER_15]: There can be lawsuits and there probably will be lawsuits, but the fact of the matter is the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on this particular matter is the department of transportation.

974
01:18:07,487 --> 01:18:14,772
[SPEAKER_15]: does not pay mitigation for two businesses as a result of public works projects.

975
01:18:15,472 --> 01:18:28,380
[SPEAKER_15]: If that was the case when they did the central artery and took down all the green space in there and did the Rose Kennedy Garden, the disruption, Mr. President, the disruption is lousy.

976
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:31,342
[SPEAKER_15]: And I understand that completely, completely.

977
01:18:36,537 --> 01:18:38,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Camuso just referred to the Rose Kennedy Garden.

978
01:18:38,798 --> 01:18:40,519
[SPEAKER_02]: The Rose Kennedy Garden was an afterthought.

979
01:18:40,839 --> 01:18:42,220
[SPEAKER_02]: It was going to be a greenway.

980
01:18:42,540 --> 01:18:44,581
[SPEAKER_02]: The Rose Kennedy Garden came in after the fact.

981
01:18:44,621 --> 01:18:52,345
[SPEAKER_02]: That was part of the mitigation and the rehabilitation because of the damage and the construction that took place in the artery.

982
01:18:52,645 --> 01:19:05,072
[SPEAKER_15]: And Mr. President, precisely, it was a public works mitigation that went to the city of Boston, not to the businesses that were directly affected in that area, like Faneuil Hall Marketplace and

983
01:19:07,461 --> 01:19:09,572
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, businesses property get taken care of.

984
01:19:10,667 --> 01:19:15,488
[SPEAKER_15]: But like I said, the city, I'm sorry, the state, they said that at this meeting.

985
01:19:16,488 --> 01:19:17,248
[SPEAKER_15]: This isn't fiction.

986
01:19:17,548 --> 01:19:20,529
[SPEAKER_15]: This is factual, what the state said to us.

987
01:19:20,569 --> 01:19:22,689
[SPEAKER_15]: Now if the law changes, I hope it changes.

988
01:19:23,209 --> 01:19:23,969
[SPEAKER_15]: I hope it changes.

989
01:19:24,309 --> 01:19:38,212
[SPEAKER_15]: But like I said, I think our biggest thing right now is doing everything in our power to help the businesses, as I've been doing with other members of this council, talking to the MBTA about moving a bus stop that is gonna be detrimental to the passengers,

990
01:19:38,972 --> 01:19:46,195
[SPEAKER_15]: in the current state of placement of it, as well as for the businesses that are already going to be dealing with.

991
01:19:46,215 --> 01:19:49,776
[SPEAKER_15]: So let's work on the stuff that we do have some input and control over.

992
01:19:50,637 --> 01:20:03,942
[SPEAKER_15]: The DOT is overseeing this project, the Department of Transportation, and City Clerk Finn, at what point have they notified you about the public hearings coming up regarding posting it on the board and everything, or not yet?

993
01:20:07,775 --> 01:20:08,395
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you turn him on?

994
01:20:08,415 --> 01:20:12,877
[SPEAKER_04]: What they tend to do is either fax over a notice or email a notice.

995
01:20:12,977 --> 01:20:16,119
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's sporadic the way some of these notices come in.

996
01:20:16,739 --> 01:20:18,980
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not quite sure on the one today.

997
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,101
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't checked the postings.

998
01:20:20,421 --> 01:20:24,282
[SPEAKER_15]: Because this Saturday, too, the bid went out for the Crystal Campbell Peace Garden.

999
01:20:24,803 --> 01:20:27,124
[SPEAKER_15]: The bid went out this Saturday, two days ago.

1000
01:20:27,724 --> 01:20:33,106
[SPEAKER_04]: So the bids are posted mostly at, when you have bids, that's posted at procurement.

1001
01:20:33,667 --> 01:20:35,167
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a big wall, posting things.

1002
01:20:35,267 --> 01:20:36,588
[SPEAKER_15]: And the DOT does notify?

1003
01:20:37,792 --> 01:21:03,677
[SPEAKER_15]: city though where it is in the city correct normally okay so so like I said it just public meetings are meetings to get the information public hearings are more legality it's a legality in certain instances you need a public hearing correct me if I'm wrong clerk Finn is that correct public hearing is a legality if it calls for you if it calls for you but they're not gonna have public hearings unless it calls for it correct

1004
01:21:04,030 --> 01:21:05,872
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, there's a difference between public hearing and public meeting.

1005
01:21:05,992 --> 01:21:06,492
[SPEAKER_15]: Exactly.

1006
01:21:07,453 --> 01:21:20,345
[SPEAKER_15]: And given the public hearings that may be called for this might be because of the river underneath it and the river being affected by it and that environmental public hearing, things of that nature.

1007
01:21:20,385 --> 01:21:20,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that correct?

1008
01:21:21,086 --> 01:21:22,007
[SPEAKER_15]: Conservation things.

1009
01:21:22,127 --> 01:21:27,032
[SPEAKER_15]: But typically there's not public hearings for doing a bridge over within a community.

1010
01:21:27,472 --> 01:21:28,533
[SPEAKER_15]: There doesn't need to be.

1011
01:21:28,837 --> 01:21:29,818
[SPEAKER_15]: because it doesn't need to be.

1012
01:21:29,838 --> 01:21:30,158
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1013
01:21:30,178 --> 01:21:34,521
[SPEAKER_15]: I just, I think that's important to, um, cause Councilor Lungo-Koehn brought up a very valid point.

1014
01:21:35,381 --> 01:21:43,906
[SPEAKER_15]: But, uh, if there is going to be public hearings, number one, they will hold them at an open, open place where people can participate.

1015
01:21:43,926 --> 01:21:45,107
[SPEAKER_15]: It will be duly advertised.

1016
01:21:45,688 --> 01:21:49,390
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, and it also will be on the bulletin boards here at city hall, but unless it calls for it,

1017
01:21:50,420 --> 01:22:04,786
[SPEAKER_15]: unless it calls for it for a specific legality, and that's because maybe they're building so close to the water and this and that, but they just don't have public hearings, as you said, Mr. Clerk, for the sake of just having public hearings.

1018
01:22:05,686 --> 01:22:10,268
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a legal authority behind a public hearing and not so much a public meeting.

1019
01:22:13,750 --> 01:22:15,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Camuso.

1020
01:22:16,050 --> 01:22:17,551
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight has the floor next.

1021
01:22:17,591 --> 01:22:18,932
[SPEAKER_07]: You have two points of information.

1022
01:22:19,012 --> 01:22:19,652
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Panto.

1023
01:22:20,767 --> 01:22:37,619
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, as it relates to the bus stop, whether it's being moved over the bridge or, as some of us were led to believe, it might be moved to Medford Square, we were supposed to be getting a report back from the T that would indicate where that bus stop was going to be moved.

1024
01:22:37,939 --> 01:22:38,600
[SPEAKER_02]: That's number one.

1025
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:42,883
[SPEAKER_02]: The other gentleman who came here that night, his name was Paul King, and he was the project manager.

1026
01:22:43,964 --> 01:22:49,127
[SPEAKER_02]: He also indicated, for which they have now changed their times from the days and the night shifts as to when

1027
01:22:50,693 --> 01:23:03,156
[SPEAKER_02]: working hours are going to take place, which is a change from what was written on January 21st, 2015, as compared to the most recent one on May 20th of this year.

1028
01:23:03,196 --> 01:23:05,797
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, once again, none of the businesses are aware of this.

1029
01:23:06,397 --> 01:23:10,258
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is a, and the request by the council was to have them here.

1030
01:23:10,638 --> 01:23:14,559
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm not going to get hung up on the legality of a hearing or a meeting.

1031
01:23:15,020 --> 01:23:15,880
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a request.

1032
01:23:16,780 --> 01:23:20,061
[SPEAKER_02]: And if the request to have a state agency or somebody come here,

1033
01:23:20,420 --> 01:23:25,762
[SPEAKER_02]: to explain what their project is about, then they should honor the request, either in writing or what have you.

1034
01:23:26,782 --> 01:23:32,925
[SPEAKER_02]: You said, Councilor Dello Russo, when I gave you the letter that you said you couldn't find and you never got, you went to the city clerk.

1035
01:23:33,005 --> 01:23:35,145
[SPEAKER_02]: The city clerk supposedly called them up.

1036
01:23:36,146 --> 01:23:37,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Never got a response, did you, Mr. Clerk?

1037
01:23:38,447 --> 01:23:41,688
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a great way to have, and he called not once, but he called twice.

1038
01:23:41,988 --> 01:23:47,610
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great way for a state agency to act on behalf of a community that has a major project going through it,

1039
01:23:48,450 --> 01:23:53,678
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're worried about allegedly a legality from a hearing to a request to be here.

1040
01:23:54,018 --> 01:23:56,141
[SPEAKER_02]: That's absolutely nonsense.

1041
01:23:56,281 --> 01:23:56,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Knight.

1042
01:23:58,645 --> 01:24:00,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1043
01:24:02,132 --> 01:24:03,393
[SPEAKER_05]: I have concerns about the bridge.

1044
01:24:03,534 --> 01:24:04,655
[SPEAKER_05]: I've raised them last week.

1045
01:24:04,675 --> 01:24:11,680
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a resolution asking the harbormaster to meet with the project manager to determine what restrictions were going to be on the roadway for boaters up river.

1046
01:24:12,921 --> 01:24:17,085
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that we've all scratched our heads and wondered what's going to happen with the buses.

1047
01:24:17,125 --> 01:24:24,631
[SPEAKER_05]: We've all scratched our heads and wondered how this off-ramp is going to work, where cars can take lefts and rights around the backside of Medford Auto to get through Medford Square.

1048
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:32,625
[SPEAKER_05]: With that being said, Mr. President, you know, I wholeheartedly feel as though another meeting would be beneficial to get some of our questions answered.

1049
01:24:32,685 --> 01:24:36,288
[SPEAKER_05]: However, it appears to me that the DOT is not willing to have this meeting.

1050
01:24:36,328 --> 01:24:45,395
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that being said, I'm wondering if it would be a beneficial exercise for us to maybe put some questions in writing as to what we want answered and send them over to the project manager and have the project manager get back to us.

1051
01:24:45,814 --> 01:24:49,755
[SPEAKER_05]: If, in fact, the project manager doesn't get back to us in a timely fashion, then we can take action.

1052
01:24:49,815 --> 01:24:55,657
[SPEAKER_05]: But at this point in time, Mr. President, let's try to get the questions answered so that we can provide the information to those people that are going to be most affected by it.

1053
01:24:57,778 --> 01:24:58,558
[SPEAKER_05]: And we can go from there.

1054
01:24:58,598 --> 01:25:01,619
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think what we really need to focus on is solutions, Mr. President.

1055
01:25:01,879 --> 01:25:06,040
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, we need to focus on how we're going to help these businesses through this tough time.

1056
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:07,381
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be three years of construction.

1057
01:25:07,821 --> 01:25:12,723
[SPEAKER_05]: How we're going to improve traffic flow during this three-year period of time as construction is going on.

1058
01:25:14,620 --> 01:25:20,282
[SPEAKER_05]: figure out what best practices work so that when we have another construction project at this scale, we're prepared to deal with it, Mr. President.

1059
01:25:21,042 --> 01:25:25,804
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I'd like to see maybe a listing of the questions that we have that we need answered.

1060
01:25:26,784 --> 01:25:40,489
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we can get those together maybe as a group in committee of the whole and then vote on it to come out of the committee and then vote on that to have those questions sent to the DOT for an answer, I think that we might be on the right track, Mr. President, to actually getting solutions.

1061
01:25:48,512 --> 01:25:49,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we have a motion?

1062
01:25:55,155 --> 01:26:01,679
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Councilor Camuso that the representatives of the project present themselves before the City Council for a meeting.

1063
01:26:02,259 --> 01:26:03,060
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

1064
01:26:05,961 --> 01:26:06,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Marks?

1065
01:26:08,122 --> 01:26:09,783
[SPEAKER_11]: I should mention a timeframe on that.

1066
01:26:14,267 --> 01:26:18,249
[SPEAKER_11]: maybe before the summer session, but I agree with the comments that were made.

1067
01:26:18,289 --> 01:26:24,653
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we all agree that a meeting or a public hearing, whatever it may be, is necessary and would be beneficial.

1068
01:26:25,673 --> 01:26:33,237
[SPEAKER_11]: I know what Councilor Knight's going after, but I think you also need, you know, I may have a bunch of questions, but there may be a hundred residents that have different questions.

1069
01:26:33,693 --> 01:26:36,335
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think a hearing or a meeting is imperative.

1070
01:26:36,735 --> 01:26:39,077
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we need to hear from the community.

1071
01:26:39,818 --> 01:26:48,365
[SPEAKER_11]: And from what I remember with the FAST-14 project, which the state was involved with, you're right, the state didn't give us any mitigation, but J.F.

1072
01:26:48,445 --> 01:26:50,566
[SPEAKER_11]: White most certainly gave us mitigation money.

1073
01:26:51,087 --> 01:26:54,890
[SPEAKER_11]: So whoever the contractor is, is the one that doles out the mitigation.

1074
01:26:55,330 --> 01:27:02,696
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's why we've asked, even with Eversource, we've asked the administration to use some leverage in order to get some mitigation.

1075
01:27:03,015 --> 01:27:04,355
[SPEAKER_11]: for tearing up all our streets.

1076
01:27:04,735 --> 01:27:21,318
[SPEAKER_11]: And we should be asking the same, whoever the contractor is of this credit bridge, for mitigation on what's going to take place, the impact of the business owners, the impact of the drive time in the morning, the commute.

1077
01:27:22,078 --> 01:27:25,219
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a host of impacts that are going to take place, Mr. President.

1078
01:27:25,259 --> 01:27:30,980
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, I hope that they don't turn a cheek at us, Mr. President.

1079
01:27:31,380 --> 01:27:32,460
[SPEAKER_11]: And if I'm not mistaken,

1080
01:27:32,904 --> 01:27:40,210
[SPEAKER_11]: Myself, Councilor Penta, I think Councilor Caraviello, we attended a meeting that was had right across the street.

1081
01:27:40,230 --> 01:27:46,896
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if it was about a year ago, I think Councilor Lungo was there too, early in the morning with the state.

1082
01:27:47,497 --> 01:27:58,265
[SPEAKER_11]: And our community development director, Lauren DiLorenzo, I'll never forget this, she stood up and pointed at the developer, I mean the state, and said, we have been left out of this process.

1083
01:27:58,726 --> 01:28:01,408
[SPEAKER_11]: You have not given us ample opportunity to speak on this.

1084
01:28:01,888 --> 01:28:05,010
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's coming from our own director of office of community development.

1085
01:28:05,531 --> 01:28:09,894
[SPEAKER_11]: So you can imagine when a member of the council gets up and says, we'd like to get more information on this.

1086
01:28:10,214 --> 01:28:16,679
[SPEAKER_11]: If our own community development office can't get it, then how are we as council supposed to get this on behalf of the residents of this community?

1087
01:28:17,130 --> 01:28:23,213
[SPEAKER_11]: And that spoke volumes that morning, Mr. President, when she spoke up, saying that they haven't been involved in the process.

1088
01:28:23,553 --> 01:28:24,713
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, that was some time back.

1089
01:28:24,753 --> 01:28:25,914
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure if it's changed.

1090
01:28:26,314 --> 01:28:34,077
[SPEAKER_11]: But I can only tell you, the only information I get is through just piecemeal and whatever I happen to read in the newspaper, Mr. President.

1091
01:28:34,097 --> 01:28:35,838
[SPEAKER_11]: So, that's a sad commentary.

1092
01:28:36,118 --> 01:28:36,498
[SPEAKER_07]: The President.

1093
01:28:36,979 --> 01:28:37,259
[SPEAKER_07]: It is.

1094
01:28:37,279 --> 01:28:37,599
[SPEAKER_07]: It is.

1095
01:28:37,659 --> 01:28:40,380
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight has the floor, and then Councilor Camuso.

1096
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:46,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I know that mitigation is going to be very important to the businesses down in the Medford Square area, and whether or not we're able to

1097
01:28:47,768 --> 01:28:55,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Triumph, that is a whole other question, but I think that there are some things that we can control here at the local level in terms of mitigation, and maybe that's something that we need to look at.

1098
01:28:55,696 --> 01:29:02,743
[SPEAKER_05]: But one of the first things that pops to mind is the biggest complaint that we're hearing out there right now from shop owners is the kiosks in Medford Square.

1099
01:29:03,043 --> 01:29:09,269
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe if the state's not willing to help us out with mitigation, then maybe we can go a step further and we as a city can help mitigate by maybe

1100
01:29:10,207 --> 01:29:11,928
[SPEAKER_05]: changing the hours of operation of the kiosk.

1101
01:29:11,948 --> 01:29:19,333
[SPEAKER_05]: So closing the kiosk down for certain days or certain periods of time in that business district while construction is going on to provide some relief to the business owners.

1102
01:29:19,933 --> 01:29:24,135
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that the construction alone, well, the traffic patents alone right now in Medford square scare people away.

1103
01:29:24,776 --> 01:29:28,938
[SPEAKER_05]: With the construction coming in the kiosk, I think this is really going to have a detrimental effect, Mr. President.

1104
01:29:29,499 --> 01:29:29,819
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1105
01:29:30,279 --> 01:29:32,140
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1106
01:29:32,180 --> 01:29:33,281
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Camuso.

1107
01:29:33,561 --> 01:29:34,121
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, thank you.

1108
01:29:34,261 --> 01:29:38,664
[SPEAKER_15]: And the city administration up to this point, this has been front and center.

1109
01:29:39,458 --> 01:29:53,443
[SPEAKER_15]: This afternoon, I believe 1 or 1.30, there was a meeting with all the department heads, the Department of Transportation, the Chamber of Commerce, and so everyone was at the table, and maybe they're working out specifics right now.

1110
01:29:54,070 --> 01:29:57,291
[SPEAKER_15]: and then they'll be bringing it forward at another level.

1111
01:29:57,832 --> 01:30:00,133
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, at another meeting, I do not know.

1112
01:30:00,533 --> 01:30:02,554
[SPEAKER_15]: But there is ongoing dialogue.

1113
01:30:03,114 --> 01:30:08,316
[SPEAKER_15]: And as Councilor Knight said, there may be something we can do internally, whether it's a tax break.

1114
01:30:08,756 --> 01:30:15,059
[SPEAKER_15]: But most of that's not going to help the businesses either, because it's the building owners, the owners of the building, and then it's businesses that are paying rent.

1115
01:30:15,459 --> 01:30:20,301
[SPEAKER_15]: But there's stuff that we might be able to do, I'm thinking, outside the box in our community, like Councilor Knight said.

1116
01:30:20,925 --> 01:30:26,167
[SPEAKER_15]: But I just, when the word mitigation came up, I heard loud and clear what they said that evening.

1117
01:30:26,407 --> 01:30:35,011
[SPEAKER_15]: And I just don't want to mislead businesses in the community that may think they're going to get a big check from the Department of Transportation as a result of this project.

1118
01:30:35,491 --> 01:30:45,296
[SPEAKER_15]: And I just think, I think we have to be fair to them and not give them false hopes that they're going to get a golden bar at the end of this project.

1119
01:30:45,336 --> 01:30:48,517
[SPEAKER_15]: When the state clearly said when they were here, they're not in the business of paying mitigation.

1120
01:30:48,955 --> 01:30:55,038
[SPEAKER_15]: But they will be willing to work with the city on maybe smaller projects in the immediate area.

1121
01:30:55,378 --> 01:31:04,882
[SPEAKER_15]: If they're parking on a park to park their trucks during the thing, they'll do the park over maybe, or something like that, similar to the other projects that have taken place here within our community.

1122
01:31:06,543 --> 01:31:10,705
[SPEAKER_15]: So I look forward to the future dialogue on this particular matter, Mr. President.

1123
01:31:18,271 --> 01:31:23,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, there are subcontractors, as Council Marks has alluded to, that are going to be responsible.

1124
01:31:24,295 --> 01:31:28,577
[SPEAKER_02]: The main contractor here, the signer of the contract is the Massachusetts Department of Transportation.

1125
01:31:28,657 --> 01:31:30,198
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the main contractor for the bridge.

1126
01:31:30,758 --> 01:31:32,239
[SPEAKER_02]: But you've got Spectra Energy.

1127
01:31:32,259 --> 01:31:33,279
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got National Grid.

1128
01:31:33,439 --> 01:31:34,960
[SPEAKER_02]: You also even have the city of Medford involved.

1129
01:31:34,980 --> 01:31:36,521
[SPEAKER_02]: You have the Massachusetts State Police.

1130
01:31:36,541 --> 01:31:39,283
[SPEAKER_02]: You have the State Department of Conservation and Recreation.

1131
01:31:39,703 --> 01:31:42,204
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are other little subcontractors involved in here.

1132
01:31:42,744 --> 01:31:47,367
[SPEAKER_02]: So I am not going to turn around and say mitigation is not a possibility when, in fact,

1133
01:31:47,703 --> 01:31:49,004
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be a possibility.

1134
01:31:49,304 --> 01:32:01,815
[SPEAKER_02]: And as far as the meeting goes today, it's another clear-cut example of this council being shut out on any types of meetings such as that, especially when they had a personal interest in this, especially on behalf of the Metro business folks.

1135
01:32:01,875 --> 01:32:09,162
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've been discussing this for months upon months upon months, and not to be even notified about a meeting to go to.

1136
01:32:09,602 --> 01:32:10,383
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just wrong.

1137
01:32:10,743 --> 01:32:15,227
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where the whole sense of frustration comes about, a complete lack of transparency.

1138
01:32:15,473 --> 01:32:20,575
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how mixed messages get sent around, not only to this building, but to the businesses within this community.

1139
01:32:21,695 --> 01:32:24,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully, pretty soon, there'll be a major change in this community.

1140
01:32:24,717 --> 01:32:25,837
[SPEAKER_02]: And this will not go on.

1141
01:32:25,877 --> 01:32:26,998
[SPEAKER_02]: This will not be tolerated.

1142
01:32:29,619 --> 01:32:32,660
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, can we take?

1143
01:32:48,112 --> 01:32:52,641
[SPEAKER_07]: to address the City Council on the police building.

1144
01:32:53,102 --> 01:32:53,262
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

1145
01:32:53,282 --> 01:32:55,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Martin, please state your name and address for the record.

1146
01:32:55,306 --> 01:32:55,526
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome.

1147
01:33:01,270 --> 01:33:02,151
[SPEAKER_00]: spirited debate.

1148
01:33:02,972 --> 01:33:06,555
[SPEAKER_00]: This council, in the last two years, has actually accomplished something.

1149
01:33:07,095 --> 01:33:09,698
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking to people and they always say, well, what did they accomplish?

1150
01:33:09,778 --> 01:33:11,499
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was actually able to tell them something.

1151
01:33:11,880 --> 01:33:13,601
[SPEAKER_00]: I told them about the DPW yard.

1152
01:33:13,641 --> 01:33:16,344
[SPEAKER_00]: I told them about getting rid of TV3.

1153
01:33:16,664 --> 01:33:17,865
[SPEAKER_00]: You've actually made progress.

1154
01:33:18,005 --> 01:33:20,968
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, in spite of arguing today,

1155
01:33:21,980 --> 01:33:26,764
[SPEAKER_00]: This committee has done a lot better in communicating.

1156
01:33:26,804 --> 01:33:37,992
[SPEAKER_00]: I know every once in a while you get heated, but it's doing a lot better, and I would ask that you continue to keep the tempers down and the conversation flowing, because you've been doing a great job.

1157
01:33:38,613 --> 01:33:43,156
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, when I drive by on Route 16 and I see the Pompeo Garage, it looks fantastic.

1158
01:33:43,596 --> 01:33:45,238
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys made that happen.

1159
01:33:45,438 --> 01:33:47,259
[SPEAKER_00]: So in spite of it all, I just wanted to thank you for that.

1160
01:33:49,801 --> 01:33:50,862
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish there was a sticker.

1161
01:33:51,424 --> 01:33:53,885
[SPEAKER_00]: that I could put on my truck that said, Blue Lives Matter.

1162
01:33:54,526 --> 01:33:58,888
[SPEAKER_00]: The police department in this city is often overlooked or taken for granted.

1163
01:33:59,408 --> 01:34:04,111
[SPEAKER_00]: We ask them to work in an environment not worthy of the sacrifice they make for us.

1164
01:34:05,271 --> 01:34:12,135
[SPEAKER_00]: The policemen and women of Medford commit to work 24 hours a day, seven days a week, including weekends and holidays.

1165
01:34:13,215 --> 01:34:14,096
[SPEAKER_00]: Give that some thought.

1166
01:34:15,096 --> 01:34:15,997
[SPEAKER_00]: Like its officers,

1167
01:34:16,554 --> 01:34:25,618
[SPEAKER_00]: the police headquarters is a building that is also open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and used even on weekends and holidays.

1168
01:34:26,739 --> 01:34:31,261
[SPEAKER_00]: I can lecture you, the public, on how an ounce of prevention beats a pound of cure.

1169
01:34:32,742 --> 01:34:39,185
[SPEAKER_00]: But unless you, the people, realize your obligation to stand behind the importance of a new building, it will never come to fruition.

1170
01:34:41,006 --> 01:34:43,127
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you how our police headquarters

1171
01:34:43,611 --> 01:34:47,833
[SPEAKER_00]: is the second most important building in this city, second only to City Hall.

1172
01:34:48,493 --> 01:34:53,935
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you, the people, do not value the role of the police department, this new structure will not be built.

1173
01:34:55,896 --> 01:35:05,179
[SPEAKER_00]: For everyone has their own wish list of projects, be it an art center or a garage, an old house renovation, or a school improvement.

1174
01:35:06,140 --> 01:35:11,562
[SPEAKER_00]: While everyone in this city gives lip service and verbalizes the need for a new police station,

1175
01:35:11,992 --> 01:35:13,973
[SPEAKER_00]: and thanks the police for being there for them.

1176
01:35:14,713 --> 01:35:21,855
[SPEAKER_00]: When push comes to shove, they choose the project that they value more over the need for a new police station.

1177
01:35:22,956 --> 01:35:24,296
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no horse in this race.

1178
01:35:24,516 --> 01:35:27,057
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no family member or friend on the police department.

1179
01:35:28,378 --> 01:35:33,920
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do know that without civil order, your other projects do not have a long shelf life.

1180
01:35:35,380 --> 01:35:40,362
[SPEAKER_00]: My fear is that by the time we pay off enough old bonds, in quotes,

1181
01:35:42,612 --> 01:35:54,034
[SPEAKER_00]: As has been stated by our politicians and administrators, the cry for new school funding will overshadow the police department once again, as the political will for schools usually do.

1182
01:35:55,534 --> 01:36:02,735
[SPEAKER_00]: Seven years is a long time, and a lot of these other new buildings are going to need a lot of major repair, and I fear that to happen.

1183
01:36:02,775 --> 01:36:03,836
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not done, though.

1184
01:36:04,996 --> 01:36:11,937
[SPEAKER_00]: Our police station was built in the early 1960s and is very outdated and has been unable to stand the test of time.

1185
01:36:12,539 --> 01:36:15,960
[SPEAKER_00]: I repeat, has been unable to stand the test of time.

1186
01:36:17,701 --> 01:36:21,262
[SPEAKER_00]: The role of the police building is not just to house the police and arrestees.

1187
01:36:21,842 --> 01:36:27,544
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a place where policy and policing can be discussed by and with the community.

1188
01:36:28,164 --> 01:36:29,845
[SPEAKER_00]: It should have a room for that purpose.

1189
01:36:30,465 --> 01:36:32,526
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be safe for officers and prisoners.

1190
01:36:33,306 --> 01:36:39,348
[SPEAKER_00]: The building needs to be larger for detective work, technology updates, and technology I also include

1191
01:36:39,857 --> 01:36:47,323
[SPEAKER_00]: The fire department, which the chief came here, or one of their representatives came here and talked about how they don't have email, that needs to be addressed.

1192
01:36:47,363 --> 01:36:50,685
[SPEAKER_00]: These are basic issues that need to be addressed.

1193
01:36:51,086 --> 01:36:55,109
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I talk about a police headquarters, I mean a police slash fire headquarters.

1194
01:36:57,351 --> 01:36:59,893
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to have secure witness-proof privacy.

1195
01:37:02,094 --> 01:37:06,278
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, somebody comes in, they witnessed a crime.

1196
01:37:07,198 --> 01:37:07,759
[SPEAKER_00]: I want it to be

1197
01:37:08,598 --> 01:37:14,341
[SPEAKER_00]: a nice little quiet place for them to meet, to talk to the officers, so that they feel comfortable coming forward.

1198
01:37:16,041 --> 01:37:17,802
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to have evidence-proof lockers.

1199
01:37:18,202 --> 01:37:20,624
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to have firearm safety and accessibility.

1200
01:37:21,104 --> 01:37:24,705
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to be located in a prominent position in the square accessible to all.

1201
01:37:26,026 --> 01:37:28,207
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally have decided that I want it right where it is.

1202
01:37:28,867 --> 01:37:29,828
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the location.

1203
01:37:29,888 --> 01:37:30,908
[SPEAKER_00]: I want it bigger than it is.

1204
01:37:31,449 --> 01:37:33,850
[SPEAKER_00]: And if things have to happen, then things have to happen.

1205
01:37:34,750 --> 01:37:36,431
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it also deters crime

1206
01:37:37,265 --> 01:37:42,767
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as when I see a police officer car and I'm driving down the street, I slow down.

1207
01:37:43,547 --> 01:37:47,969
[SPEAKER_00]: If I see the police department, I'm going to say, oh, there, and it's going to remind me.

1208
01:37:48,529 --> 01:37:54,051
[SPEAKER_00]: It is also a place where people feel comfortable that they should go to if they're lost, if they need help.

1209
01:37:54,451 --> 01:37:58,072
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be visible so that if you want it, you know where it is.

1210
01:37:59,373 --> 01:38:02,654
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone agrees with this assessment from parents to the arts community.

1211
01:38:03,114 --> 01:38:04,875
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is no one wants to pay for it.

1212
01:38:06,118 --> 01:38:08,639
[SPEAKER_00]: The political will stops at the funding trough.

1213
01:38:10,519 --> 01:38:14,681
[SPEAKER_00]: Allocating the money is where the city stops short of contracting this project out.

1214
01:38:15,701 --> 01:38:15,981
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?

1215
01:38:16,241 --> 01:38:28,785
[SPEAKER_00]: Because everyone has their agenda, that they value more than the police building, including employees who sometimes would rather see a personal raise in their take-home pay than committing millions to a police building.

1216
01:38:29,805 --> 01:38:31,046
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone has their agenda.

1217
01:38:31,186 --> 01:38:32,386
[SPEAKER_00]: Parents want more teachers.

1218
01:38:33,087 --> 01:38:34,507
[SPEAKER_00]: Arts Council wants Springstep.

1219
01:38:35,211 --> 01:38:36,793
[SPEAKER_00]: Politicians want to be reelected.

1220
01:38:38,075 --> 01:38:48,068
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone has a stake in not committing the millions of dollars required to have a full, real, state-of-the-art police building that the police could work out of.

1221
01:38:48,545 --> 01:38:50,886
[SPEAKER_00]: that you, the people, can own and feel proud of.

1222
01:38:51,787 --> 01:38:57,049
[SPEAKER_00]: The location of the police station should be right where it is, visible and accessible to everyone.

1223
01:38:57,670 --> 01:39:01,592
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that means taking some of the buildings out for eminent domain, so be it.

1224
01:39:02,132 --> 01:39:06,474
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone should know where the station is and it should be built large and welcoming.

1225
01:39:08,615 --> 01:39:09,476
[SPEAKER_00]: I repeat, welcoming.

1226
01:39:12,025 --> 01:39:17,909
[SPEAKER_00]: It should incorporate the drug education personnel to the judgment area for parking tickets.

1227
01:39:18,810 --> 01:39:21,492
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be viewed as everyone's building.

1228
01:39:23,313 --> 01:39:26,716
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no immediate gratification in this build-out.

1229
01:39:27,476 --> 01:39:33,781
[SPEAKER_00]: Citizens of Medford, all, have their priorities and most do not have the police station at the top of their list.

1230
01:39:34,381 --> 01:39:37,624
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet this building is open 24 hours a day and used by everyone.

1231
01:39:38,745 --> 01:39:40,446
[SPEAKER_00]: If you choose to ignore my advice,

1232
01:39:40,976 --> 01:39:47,758
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't come crying to me when the police morale is down and time on a call lags, because you didn't care about taking care of them.

1233
01:39:49,739 --> 01:39:51,279
[SPEAKER_00]: You want the best police department.

1234
01:39:51,980 --> 01:39:53,500
[SPEAKER_00]: You want an engaged citizenry.

1235
01:39:54,420 --> 01:39:56,461
[SPEAKER_00]: You want crime and drug issues to be handled.

1236
01:39:56,821 --> 01:39:57,541
[SPEAKER_00]: This takes money.

1237
01:39:58,962 --> 01:40:03,883
[SPEAKER_00]: Money you will not see the immediate benefits of, but in the long run will pay off.

1238
01:40:04,664 --> 01:40:07,345
[SPEAKER_00]: No other building project should even be discussed, i.e.

1239
01:40:07,385 --> 01:40:08,545
[SPEAKER_00]: the garage or art centers,

1240
01:40:09,056 --> 01:40:11,117
[SPEAKER_00]: until a police building is in the works.

1241
01:40:11,778 --> 01:40:22,603
[SPEAKER_00]: And if a small amount of businesses need to be taken by eminent domain to make enough room for the police structure, that's a hit they will have to take, and we will have to compensate them for.

1242
01:40:23,684 --> 01:40:25,205
[SPEAKER_00]: Public safety comes first.

1243
01:40:25,785 --> 01:40:26,085
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1244
01:40:27,366 --> 01:40:28,367
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much, Ms.

1245
01:40:28,407 --> 01:40:28,667
[SPEAKER_07]: Martin.

1246
01:40:29,167 --> 01:40:30,027
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Caraviello.

1247
01:40:30,868 --> 01:40:31,808
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1248
01:40:32,049 --> 01:40:34,890
[SPEAKER_10]: I think, Gene, you brought up a lot of good points there.

1249
01:40:35,330 --> 01:40:38,252
[SPEAKER_10]: And I will say this, this whole council

1250
01:40:38,955 --> 01:40:43,037
[SPEAKER_10]: His uniform was standing behind the police station and warning one.

1251
01:40:43,297 --> 01:40:49,579
[SPEAKER_10]: If you can recall, during last year's election, that was number one on everybody's list, including the mayor.

1252
01:40:51,560 --> 01:40:53,200
[SPEAKER_10]: What was needed was a police station.

1253
01:40:54,081 --> 01:40:56,202
[SPEAKER_10]: And, yeah, okay.

1254
01:40:56,242 --> 01:40:57,422
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, may I respond to that?

1255
01:40:57,462 --> 01:41:00,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor will finish his remarks.

1256
01:41:00,403 --> 01:41:01,644
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.

1257
01:41:01,924 --> 01:41:04,104
[SPEAKER_10]: That was the number one request of everybody, including the mayor.

1258
01:41:04,485 --> 01:41:08,006
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, now we're, two years have gone, a new election's coming up,

1259
01:41:09,688 --> 01:41:11,889
[SPEAKER_10]: And everyone's going to ask, what's the number one priority again?

1260
01:41:11,909 --> 01:41:13,690
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're all going to say the police station again.

1261
01:41:14,530 --> 01:41:18,712
[SPEAKER_10]: And now we have a chance where there's going to be a new mayor.

1262
01:41:19,952 --> 01:41:27,175
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see where the new mayor stands on, or the new potential mayor stands on this police station project.

1263
01:41:27,255 --> 01:41:38,160
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, the one that's running currently, as said when she was the budget director, that she didn't think it would be possible for seven years.

1264
01:41:39,630 --> 01:41:43,812
[SPEAKER_10]: seven years, so it means we have to wait seven, it's gonna take three to build, that's 10 years.

1265
01:41:44,892 --> 01:41:48,034
[SPEAKER_10]: The city can't wait 10 years to build another police station.

1266
01:41:48,334 --> 01:41:48,894
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree with you.

1267
01:41:49,194 --> 01:42:00,019
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you're right, it's a 24 hour building, it's just as important as city hall is, because they don't, this building closes and the holidays and the weekends, they're open, they never stop working.

1268
01:42:00,059 --> 01:42:06,342
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not fair to our policemen and the men and women who work in there, that they work in those conditions.

1269
01:42:06,382 --> 01:42:07,203
[SPEAKER_10]: They're jammed in there.

1270
01:42:08,847 --> 01:42:15,773
[SPEAKER_10]: Now they've branched over into the former training facility that's not used anymore as a training facility.

1271
01:42:17,093 --> 01:42:28,021
[SPEAKER_10]: It's high time that this becomes a main point of the new election coming up over how that is going to get built and funded.

1272
01:42:28,902 --> 01:42:32,104
[SPEAKER_10]: I do agree with you.

1273
01:42:32,124 --> 01:42:35,587
[SPEAKER_10]: It should be one of the biggest points asked of the new mayor.

1274
01:42:37,303 --> 01:42:38,224
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

1275
01:42:38,544 --> 01:42:38,804
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1276
01:42:38,824 --> 01:42:39,004
[SPEAKER_00]: Please.

1277
01:42:39,605 --> 01:42:44,909
[SPEAKER_00]: With all due respect, the budget director did say it would take seven years, and that's my problem.

1278
01:42:46,191 --> 01:42:46,851
[SPEAKER_00]: That's too long.

1279
01:42:47,311 --> 01:42:51,715
[SPEAKER_10]: That's absolutely... Or seven before we could even start talking about it.

1280
01:42:51,735 --> 01:42:52,396
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is ridiculous.

1281
01:42:52,896 --> 01:42:54,017
[SPEAKER_00]: No offense to anybody.

1282
01:42:54,037 --> 01:42:56,199
[SPEAKER_10]: So seven and then three years, the bill means 10 years.

1283
01:42:57,020 --> 01:42:57,680
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ridiculous.

1284
01:42:57,720 --> 01:42:57,880
[SPEAKER_00]: It is?

1285
01:42:57,900 --> 01:42:58,241
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with you.

1286
01:42:58,261 --> 01:42:59,642
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to happen and it needs to start now.

1287
01:42:59,662 --> 01:43:02,184
[SPEAKER_10]: This whole group of seven, I think, agrees with you there.

1288
01:43:02,733 --> 01:43:05,254
[SPEAKER_00]: With all due respect to the administration, it's too late.

1289
01:43:06,114 --> 01:43:07,695
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to happen.

1290
01:43:08,235 --> 01:43:09,155
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be now.

1291
01:43:09,536 --> 01:43:12,417
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in seven years, there's going to be more buildings.

1292
01:43:12,437 --> 01:43:14,017
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be more holes in this ceiling.

1293
01:43:14,057 --> 01:43:15,738
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be more issues that are going to come up.

1294
01:43:15,778 --> 01:43:17,659
[SPEAKER_00]: And schools will come in.

1295
01:43:17,979 --> 01:43:20,020
[SPEAKER_00]: And the parents have a very large voice in the city.

1296
01:43:20,160 --> 01:43:22,861
[SPEAKER_00]: No offense to the parents, but they have a very large voice.

1297
01:43:23,001 --> 01:43:28,063
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the school kids come in and you see the fourth graders, you're going to cry for them.

1298
01:43:28,543 --> 01:43:31,284
[SPEAKER_00]: And they always lose to the police, always lose out.

1299
01:43:31,482 --> 01:43:33,124
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of information, Councilor Caraviello.

1300
01:43:33,384 --> 01:43:38,929
[SPEAKER_10]: You are correct, because you're already starting to see a little bit of a groundswell of people talking about a new high school.

1301
01:43:40,030 --> 01:43:45,915
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, as I'm out around, I hear that, how about a new high school, when we're going to build a new high school?

1302
01:43:48,221 --> 01:43:48,601
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

1303
01:43:48,641 --> 01:43:49,582
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm in agreement with you.

1304
01:43:50,022 --> 01:43:53,085
[SPEAKER_00]: This whole committee said that they want a new police department.

1305
01:43:53,125 --> 01:43:55,166
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single one of them said that's at the top of their list.

1306
01:43:55,186 --> 01:43:56,107
[SPEAKER_00]: And I commend you for that.

1307
01:43:56,727 --> 01:43:58,929
[SPEAKER_00]: But the people, I'm not talking to you so much.

1308
01:43:59,429 --> 01:44:04,073
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking to those folks out there because they're the ones that have to put the pressure to get the police station.

1309
01:44:04,113 --> 01:44:11,879
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have to realize that there is going to be, have to be a sacrifice on their part because it's not going to happen unless they sacrifice.

1310
01:44:11,899 --> 01:44:17,403
[SPEAKER_10]: If you recall at one of the meetings, uh, I was the one that brought up a possibility of a two and a half override.

1311
01:44:18,063 --> 01:44:19,946
[SPEAKER_10]: which got shot down in a matter of like three seconds.

1312
01:44:21,528 --> 01:44:25,434
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I know we've never had one, but maybe that might be the end.

1313
01:44:25,454 --> 01:44:27,116
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to be bonded, and it needs to be bonded now.

1314
01:44:27,136 --> 01:44:28,939
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe that's the avenue that we may have to go.

1315
01:44:29,379 --> 01:44:30,181
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be bonded.

1316
01:44:30,201 --> 01:44:33,145
[SPEAKER_10]: But I was told that that will not happen in this administration.

1317
01:44:33,622 --> 01:44:38,587
[SPEAKER_00]: With all due respect, if we needed to bond for a new high school, there would be parents right here.

1318
01:44:39,448 --> 01:44:42,051
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not the same as when you see a bunch of police officers.

1319
01:44:42,091 --> 01:44:44,253
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 100 police officers in their families.

1320
01:44:44,753 --> 01:44:51,680
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't compare in the voice, the political voice, compared to the school department, school committee, and all those parents and all those kids.

1321
01:44:53,082 --> 01:44:53,642
[SPEAKER_00]: God bless them.

1322
01:44:54,513 --> 01:45:00,015
[SPEAKER_00]: But it will happen, and the police will get pushed to the back of the line once again.

1323
01:45:00,375 --> 01:45:02,656
[SPEAKER_00]: So when that happens, don't come crying to me.

1324
01:45:03,096 --> 01:45:03,776
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I'm saying.

1325
01:45:04,196 --> 01:45:04,496
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1326
01:45:05,256 --> 01:45:06,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight has the floor next.

1327
01:45:07,517 --> 01:45:08,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1328
01:45:08,838 --> 01:45:09,038
[SPEAKER_05]: And Ms.

1329
01:45:09,078 --> 01:45:11,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Martin, thank you very much for that thorough analysis.

1330
01:45:12,759 --> 01:45:20,581
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things that you said really stuck out to me, and that was the fact that seven years is too long, because in seven years, we're going to look at our school buildings that are going to be deteriorating.

1331
01:45:21,462 --> 01:45:22,882
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's a major problem.

1332
01:45:23,281 --> 01:45:26,582
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have a brand new DPW yard, just built, just built.

1333
01:45:26,722 --> 01:45:27,742
[SPEAKER_05]: The paint's not even dry yet.

1334
01:45:28,563 --> 01:45:30,743
[SPEAKER_05]: What's our capital maintenance plan at the DPW yard?

1335
01:45:30,943 --> 01:45:32,404
[SPEAKER_05]: This is our city's number one asset.

1336
01:45:32,444 --> 01:45:34,624
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the largest investment we've made in quite some time.

1337
01:45:34,745 --> 01:45:35,505
[SPEAKER_05]: What's our plan?

1338
01:45:35,805 --> 01:45:43,687
[SPEAKER_05]: What are we going to do to be sure that this stays a state-of-the-art facility, so that 10 years down the line, we're not looking to borne money to fix something we've already fixed, Ms.

1339
01:45:43,707 --> 01:45:43,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Martin.

1340
01:45:43,947 --> 01:45:46,548
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that that's a great assessment.

1341
01:45:46,608 --> 01:45:48,269
[SPEAKER_05]: And that leads me into my point.

1342
01:45:48,669 --> 01:45:52,690
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to have a capital improvement fund in the city of Medford for our buildings.

1343
01:45:53,107 --> 01:45:56,768
[SPEAKER_05]: And without that, we're going to be behind the eight ball all the time.

1344
01:45:57,088 --> 01:46:05,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Until we actually take care of the facilities that we own, and perpetual maintenance care isn't a bad idea, a perpetual fund.

1345
01:46:05,892 --> 01:46:15,435
[SPEAKER_05]: That's something that I support, a capital maintenance and trust fund, where we dedicate a certain portion of our city's budget to a trust fund, just for the purpose of maintaining and upkeeping the current buildings that we have, Mr. President.

1346
01:46:16,015 --> 01:46:16,356
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Ms.

1347
01:46:16,396 --> 01:46:20,197
[SPEAKER_05]: Martin, I think that that was a very good point that you made, because there are going to be competing interests.

1348
01:46:20,590 --> 01:46:30,132
[SPEAKER_05]: the more time that goes on if, in fact, we don't have a capital maintenance plan to keep the buildings and the existing assets that we have up to par to be livable, to be workable, to be usable.

1349
01:46:30,432 --> 01:46:34,293
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you very much for taking the time to come up here and provide us with that thoughtful analysis.

1350
01:46:34,493 --> 01:46:34,833
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1351
01:46:34,873 --> 01:46:35,953
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do agree also.

1352
01:46:36,113 --> 01:46:36,534
[SPEAKER_00]: One second.

1353
01:46:36,594 --> 01:46:36,814
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

1354
01:46:37,794 --> 01:46:38,334
[SPEAKER_00]: I do agree.

1355
01:46:38,414 --> 01:46:44,455
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm totally for a 5%, whatever that number is, for a maintenance plan for every single city building.

1356
01:46:44,675 --> 01:46:47,136
[SPEAKER_00]: I am totally on board with that before we do anything else.

1357
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:52,361
[SPEAKER_07]: and I believe that was part of the new school construction that was never followed through on.

1358
01:46:52,401 --> 01:46:53,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight, you're all set?

1359
01:46:54,102 --> 01:46:54,962
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, I rest.

1360
01:46:55,502 --> 01:46:56,382
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1361
01:46:56,422 --> 01:46:57,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Panto.

1362
01:46:57,202 --> 01:47:00,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Just on that point, I'm glad you just brought that up because I was alluding to that.

1363
01:47:00,603 --> 01:47:08,825
[SPEAKER_02]: When we built our new school buildings, they've gone on 13 years now, if not more, the 5% on an annual basis was supposed to be each school budget.

1364
01:47:09,725 --> 01:47:13,326
[SPEAKER_02]: The state never came in here to monitor that, to see if it was.

1365
01:47:13,686 --> 01:47:16,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Councilor Caraviello, on the second year of his term, in year two,

1366
01:47:17,610 --> 01:47:20,073
[SPEAKER_02]: brought up a report that had $1,200,000 of repairs for the schools.

1367
01:47:20,093 --> 01:47:20,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that correct, sir?

1368
01:47:20,994 --> 01:47:21,454
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1369
01:47:21,474 --> 01:47:24,818
[SPEAKER_02]: $1,200,000 for schools were no more, at that point in time, maybe 12 years old, 10, 11, 12 years old.

1370
01:47:24,838 --> 01:47:25,519
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're worried about

1371
01:47:32,666 --> 01:47:35,628
[SPEAKER_02]: a new police station and making sure that it's going to be rehabbed.

1372
01:47:35,889 --> 01:47:36,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Look up at the ceiling there.

1373
01:47:36,850 --> 01:47:37,890
[SPEAKER_02]: You see that ceiling right there?

1374
01:47:38,151 --> 01:47:38,391
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.

1375
01:47:38,411 --> 01:47:39,231
[SPEAKER_02]: That's been like that.

1376
01:47:39,272 --> 01:47:39,812
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how long?

1377
01:47:40,553 --> 01:47:41,954
[SPEAKER_02]: That's been going on almost three years.

1378
01:47:42,754 --> 01:47:48,299
[SPEAKER_02]: And the superintendent of the schools is sitting exactly where the gentleman is sitting there when that ceiling came down, and he's lucky he didn't get killed.

1379
01:47:48,980 --> 01:47:51,882
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what the city's idea of maintenance is right there.

1380
01:47:52,322 --> 01:47:55,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Cover the hole up, patch it up, and maybe nothing will be said.

1381
01:47:55,465 --> 01:47:56,166
[SPEAKER_02]: You heard it tonight.

1382
01:47:56,186 --> 01:47:57,126
[SPEAKER_02]: You heard about the library.

1383
01:47:57,146 --> 01:47:58,988
[SPEAKER_02]: You heard about the bathrooms, okay?

1384
01:47:59,248 --> 01:48:01,510
[SPEAKER_02]: You go through the infrastructure of our city.

1385
01:48:01,853 --> 01:48:09,519
[SPEAKER_02]: There were just so many things that for the past many years have been ignored, completely and totally ignored, whitewashed over.

1386
01:48:09,639 --> 01:48:09,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

1387
01:48:10,559 --> 01:48:11,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you know why?

1388
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:17,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Because at all these bonds that the city has outstanding there, they're all going to be paid on a back end.

1389
01:48:17,685 --> 01:48:20,567
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's interest only for the first five or six years.

1390
01:48:21,167 --> 01:48:23,469
[SPEAKER_02]: God bless whoever the next mayor is going to be.

1391
01:48:23,529 --> 01:48:28,913
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope I have a chance to do this because I want to revitalize that whole situation on how

1392
01:48:29,582 --> 01:48:32,163
[SPEAKER_02]: this city is going to pay for those bonds in the future.

1393
01:48:32,723 --> 01:48:37,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you realize on the fifth and the sixth year what the cost is going to be in this particular budget to pay for those bonds?

1394
01:48:38,165 --> 01:48:39,545
[SPEAKER_02]: You won't see any new buildings in here.

1395
01:48:39,745 --> 01:48:43,367
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll just be paying off for the bonds that you have here right now.

1396
01:48:44,327 --> 01:48:52,830
[SPEAKER_02]: So what needs to take place here is a thorough and an exhaustive review of how these buildings are going to be reviewed, how these buildings are going to take place.

1397
01:48:53,983 --> 01:48:59,946
[SPEAKER_02]: This past year, the school department budget passed $2 million additional dollars from last year to this year.

1398
01:49:00,626 --> 01:49:02,066
[SPEAKER_02]: God knows what they have in it for this year.

1399
01:49:02,827 --> 01:49:06,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Salaries increased, as the councilor to my right, Councilor Lungo-Koehn and current.

1400
01:49:06,368 --> 01:49:16,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people got $20,000 salary increases, and I believe there was almost $32 million in transfers from last year's budget before the end of the year took place.

1401
01:49:17,013 --> 01:49:21,235
[SPEAKER_02]: So how are we talking about that being a legitimate budget when you pass it in the beginning of the year?

1402
01:49:21,315 --> 01:49:21,735
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1403
01:49:22,266 --> 01:49:24,987
[SPEAKER_02]: These are all tricks of the trade, apparently, that have been going on for years.

1404
01:49:25,947 --> 01:49:44,732
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you have, all of a sudden, $2 million in additional dollars, and you start hiring extra people at $90,000 and $100,000 a year, and you take it away from the classroom, you take it away from the teachers, you take it away from the supplies, and you take it away from the front entrance of that high school, it looks like it's bombed out, like a war zone, because the bricks and everything are shattered.

1405
01:49:44,972 --> 01:49:47,813
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm surprised there are enough kids that have not broken their ankles or their legs.

1406
01:49:48,493 --> 01:49:50,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Handles still off the front door to come in.

1407
01:49:51,154 --> 01:49:51,694
[SPEAKER_02]: That's wrong.

1408
01:49:52,320 --> 01:49:56,222
[SPEAKER_02]: And when the parent goes up there and looks at it and says, is that where I'm going to send my kid?

1409
01:49:56,242 --> 01:49:57,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I really want my kid to go there?

1410
01:49:58,484 --> 01:50:04,567
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why they get forced to go to these private schools, because appearance, as you know, is the name of the game.

1411
01:50:06,108 --> 01:50:09,991
[SPEAKER_02]: They spent $500,000 to redo this building over, just this council chamber.

1412
01:50:10,591 --> 01:50:13,232
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it cost $497,000 to build the entire building, PWA days.

1413
01:50:13,252 --> 01:50:14,493
[SPEAKER_02]: But $500,000 to do this over.

1414
01:50:18,139 --> 01:50:19,420
[SPEAKER_02]: That's been like that for three years.

1415
01:50:19,460 --> 01:50:24,004
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the molding, if you look at the molding, that's ready to go and that's coming down and nothing's been done.

1416
01:50:24,064 --> 01:50:26,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing in the budget, no repair work, no nothing.

1417
01:50:26,446 --> 01:50:30,069
[SPEAKER_02]: And y'all worried about a police station and they can't even figure out how to do this.

1418
01:50:32,271 --> 01:50:37,335
[SPEAKER_02]: The next administration hopefully will be a work in composite between the council and the mayor.

1419
01:50:38,276 --> 01:50:39,657
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's going to be a meeting of the minds.

1420
01:50:40,363 --> 01:50:48,386
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that way there, when the money is going to be spent, it's going to be spent, and everybody's going to be on board to understand how it's going to be spent, when it's going to be spent, and where it's going to be spent for.

1421
01:50:49,267 --> 01:50:51,227
[SPEAKER_02]: That hasn't taken place here in 28 years.

1422
01:50:51,808 --> 01:50:53,949
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can assure you, it will take place.

1423
01:50:55,489 --> 01:50:55,729
Thank you.

1424
01:50:56,450 --> 01:51:05,893
Mr. President, can we take 15479, please?

1425
01:51:10,272 --> 01:51:11,933
[SPEAKER_07]: we laid on the table last week to this week.

1426
01:51:13,855 --> 01:51:18,818
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of a council paper to take a couple of Penta to take a paper off the table.

1427
01:51:19,478 --> 01:51:26,844
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor of those opposed 15 for 79, the future of Lawrence Memorial hospitals to be discussed.

1428
01:51:27,224 --> 01:51:28,024
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Penta.

1429
01:51:28,225 --> 01:51:38,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, as a result of, unfortunately the merger that did not take place between partners and Lawrence Memorial hospital and the Melrose Wakefield on January 29th of this past year,

1430
01:51:39,415 --> 01:51:53,404
[SPEAKER_02]: when the judge, Judge Sanders, issued her 48-page decision not agreeing to this because she did not believe that what Martha Coakley had put together was going to work in the best interests of the hospitals mentioned in as well as offshore.

1431
01:51:54,084 --> 01:52:07,412
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on top of that, Martha Healy, Maura Healy, the new attorney general coming in and likewise not only supporting the judge, but nixing the whole deal and was willing and is willing to go to court.

1432
01:52:08,471 --> 01:52:12,154
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe we have a council resolution asking her and both parties to be here.

1433
01:52:13,034 --> 01:52:18,798
[SPEAKER_02]: I've taken the time to speak to some doctors and some employees up at the Lawrence Memorial Hospital.

1434
01:52:20,199 --> 01:52:31,868
[SPEAKER_02]: And since at the present time, the third and the fourth floor of the hospital is not being used to any type of its potential, never mind its maximum, I'd like to make an offering and throw this back out.

1435
01:52:31,928 --> 01:52:34,870
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully it gets back to not only the Lawrence Memorial, but to partners,

1436
01:52:36,210 --> 01:53:00,751
[SPEAKER_02]: If we take a look at the doctors that are operating here in the city of Medford that are Hallmark Hospital doctors and at the same time private practitioners, and offer them room and space on the third and fourth floor of the hospital, and leaving the first and second floors available for emergency, for prompt care, emergency services, and what's presently in there right now, it would be a way not only to utilize the hospital

1437
01:53:01,222 --> 01:53:06,466
[SPEAKER_02]: with a complete medical density of doctors, no matter what their professions might be.

1438
01:53:06,966 --> 01:53:16,832
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the same time, make the offering to partners, rather than have the Lawrence be part of a consortium, which included the South Shore, which included Melrose-Wakefield.

1439
01:53:17,333 --> 01:53:31,002
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be an independent, isolated medical facility that the partners, Mass General, would be willing to entertain, which would not have to go through any type of a consortium, or a review, or to go through a

1440
01:53:31,896 --> 01:53:33,257
[SPEAKER_02]: 48-page review.

1441
01:53:33,857 --> 01:53:41,482
[SPEAKER_02]: People don't realize that the Lawrence Memorial Hospital was in a profit-making position before this whole idea of this merger took place.

1442
01:53:42,263 --> 01:53:48,466
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the last few years, a lot of its finances and a lot of its profits have been carried over to the Melrose-Wakefield.

1443
01:53:49,347 --> 01:53:58,913
[SPEAKER_02]: And unfortunately for the Lawrence Memorial, they did not receive the same benefits that the Melrose-Wakefield Hospital has received most recently over the past two to three years.

1444
01:53:59,738 --> 01:54:13,044
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's maybe because the former president, who's no longer the president, who left the day after the deal didn't go through, did not have the same feeling to the Lawrence Memorial as he had as being president over at the Melrose-Wakefield.

1445
01:54:13,664 --> 01:54:16,225
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think this would really bode well for our community.

1446
01:54:16,285 --> 01:54:26,730
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it would bode well for our citizens, seniors, mothers with babies, emergency room, prompt care locations, and for any other doctor that might be having a situation where

1447
01:54:27,362 --> 01:54:52,346
[SPEAKER_02]: either parking presents itself with a problem, location presents itself with a problem, but if they were all centrally located, because everybody knows where the Lawrence Memorial Hospital is, and if they were centrally located there, and they worked their offices out of that building, and even if they looked at the positioning that the doctors, to some degree, are not part of the nonprofit, and there is a way to legally separate the buildings or the floors or what have you, because anything is possible.

1448
01:54:53,027 --> 01:54:55,667
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why I'm throwing this out there as a possibility

1449
01:54:56,124 --> 01:55:02,689
[SPEAKER_02]: to keep as many doctors as we can here, but also the greater possibility to bring Mass General partners here into the city of Medford.

1450
01:55:03,450 --> 01:55:05,732
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a great interest in Mr. Cardiology.

1451
01:55:06,092 --> 01:55:08,334
[SPEAKER_02]: They think it's a great team of doctors that are there.

1452
01:55:08,894 --> 01:55:16,020
[SPEAKER_02]: They were one of the first, if not the first group of doctors that partners, I believe, entertain for the purposes of hopefully being part of this consortium.

1453
01:55:16,721 --> 01:55:24,267
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, unfortunately on January 29th when the deal did not go through and Judge Sanders didn't approve it because she felt that for which Martha Coakley

1454
01:55:24,775 --> 01:55:33,277
[SPEAKER_02]: had put in her request for the merger that the cost would not be contained, as they said it would be for a six-year period of time.

1455
01:55:33,837 --> 01:55:45,821
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a result of that, I believe there were 50 independent doctors and medical professionals and presidents of other hospitals, local area hospitals, who did not want it, did not believe it would serve in the best interest of the community.

1456
01:55:46,241 --> 01:55:47,421
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe that's the reason why.

1457
01:55:47,461 --> 01:55:49,982
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what the 48-page decision says.

1458
01:55:51,275 --> 01:56:21,045
[SPEAKER_02]: So, with that being said, Mr. President, I move, Mr. Clerk, and I don't know if the words are going to be very probably general right now, that the Lawrence Memorial Hospital look at entertaining the utilization of their third and fourth floor locations for the purposes of offering to all Medford doctors an opportunity to house their private practices there.

1459
01:56:22,986 --> 01:56:38,614
[SPEAKER_02]: in concert with the first and second, with the emergency and prompt care, the other medical facilities that the Lawrence Memorial offers now, and present that to the Partners Mass General Board, our president.

1460
01:56:40,675 --> 01:56:47,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Just for the point of clarity, Councilor, that the Hallmark Health presented to the Partners Board.

1461
01:56:47,998 --> 01:56:48,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1462
01:56:48,778 --> 01:56:48,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1463
01:56:49,799 --> 01:56:51,940
[SPEAKER_02]: For the purposes of presenting to the Hallmark Health,

1464
01:56:54,373 --> 01:57:08,676
[SPEAKER_02]: in essence, and may present that to partners, Mass General, for the purposes of being an independent affiliate of the Mass General and not part of the original consortium.

1465
01:57:09,476 --> 01:57:10,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have it, Eddie?

1466
01:57:10,756 --> 01:57:12,137
[SPEAKER_02]: You may have to go back and watch the video.

1467
01:57:13,957 --> 01:57:18,698
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that was one more point of clarification, Councilor, for the point of voting on this resolution.

1468
01:57:19,258 --> 01:57:24,079
[SPEAKER_07]: Was anything of what you said done in consultation with an official from Hallmark Health?

1469
01:57:24,962 --> 01:57:30,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Not with homelike help, but speaking with their doctors, nurses, and as well as patients who thought it was a good idea.

1470
01:57:30,323 --> 01:57:31,544
[SPEAKER_02]: But doctors and nurses, yes.

1471
01:57:33,104 --> 01:57:33,964
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a negative.

1472
01:57:36,565 --> 01:57:37,985
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Councilor Penta.

1473
01:57:42,447 --> 01:57:43,347
[SPEAKER_07]: Madam Vice President.

1474
01:57:43,487 --> 01:57:45,007
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a point of clarification.

1475
01:57:45,027 --> 01:57:45,607
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I wanted to.

1476
01:57:45,647 --> 01:57:47,248
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a third and fourth floor.

1477
01:57:47,268 --> 01:57:48,528
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a third and fourth floor, so to house.

1478
01:57:48,668 --> 01:57:48,768
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

1479
01:57:48,808 --> 01:57:51,809
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're just asking the question, have them discuss it.

1480
01:57:54,597 --> 01:57:55,217
[SPEAKER_02]: On that motion.

1481
01:57:55,437 --> 01:57:55,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Roll call vote.

1482
01:57:55,998 --> 01:58:05,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President and have that forwarded to the hallmark board of directors to be forwarded to home, uh, to be forwarded to a partners mass general.

1483
01:58:07,101 --> 01:58:08,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1484
01:58:09,842 --> 01:58:16,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Camuso, Councilor Caraviello, Councilor Knight, vice-president Long and Kern.

1485
01:58:16,865 --> 01:58:17,085
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1486
01:58:17,865 --> 01:58:18,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks.

1487
01:58:18,785 --> 01:58:19,085
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1488
01:58:19,506 --> 01:58:20,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Penta.

1489
01:58:20,166 --> 01:58:20,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1490
01:58:20,896 --> 01:58:21,717
[SPEAKER_07]: President Dello Russo?

1491
01:58:21,757 --> 01:58:21,997
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1492
01:58:22,497 --> 01:58:27,621
[SPEAKER_07]: On the vote of one absent, two in the negative, four in the affirmative, the motion passes.

1493
01:58:31,745 --> 01:58:37,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Papers in the hands of the clerk, offered under suspension by President Dello Russo and Councilor Knight.

1494
01:58:38,470 --> 01:58:48,418
[SPEAKER_07]: Be it resolved that the City Solicitor advise and render an opinion to the Council as to the process and parameters for the Council to establish a Charter Review Committee.

1495
01:58:49,415 --> 01:58:54,959
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty self-explanatory, and we can discuss it when we get a response back to us.

1496
01:58:55,160 --> 01:58:55,960
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion, Mr. President.

1497
01:58:55,980 --> 01:58:57,241
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion, Councilor Penta.

1498
01:58:58,182 --> 01:58:59,243
[SPEAKER_02]: I am absolutely perplexed.

1499
01:59:00,064 --> 01:59:15,516
[SPEAKER_02]: You and Councilor Knight are both offering these resolutions, but when this was presented over here for the purposes of possibly entertaining it by Mr. Stirello, the both of you were opposed to it, and now all of a sudden you're for it, and the people who had an opportunity to speak on it aren't even here.

1500
01:59:15,536 --> 01:59:17,958
[SPEAKER_02]: I respectfully request that I lay on the table

1501
01:59:18,345 --> 01:59:21,207
[SPEAKER_02]: And anyone interested who might be watching can come next week to discuss this.

1502
01:59:21,608 --> 01:59:32,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think this is way too important of an issue to not have the public either be advised of it, but I'm just dumbfounded that people who are against it now want to get an opinion when you didn't want to do it back then.

1503
01:59:34,297 --> 01:59:37,160
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just asking for an opinion.

1504
01:59:37,400 --> 01:59:39,421
[SPEAKER_02]: But you refused the gentleman when he came before, though.

1505
01:59:40,542 --> 01:59:41,363
[SPEAKER_02]: So what changed your mind?

1506
01:59:43,532 --> 01:59:47,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I signed on to this resolution because I want to know what the process is.

1507
01:59:47,074 --> 01:59:48,115
[SPEAKER_05]: There are multiple processes.

1508
01:59:48,155 --> 01:59:48,995
[SPEAKER_05]: This council can do it.

1509
01:59:49,215 --> 01:59:51,317
[SPEAKER_05]: There can be a citizen-driven petition as well.

1510
01:59:51,717 --> 02:00:00,482
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's important for the city clerk to come out and provide us with the perimeters, which venue we can recommend people take, which direction people may want to go or may not want to go.

1511
02:00:00,502 --> 02:00:04,265
[SPEAKER_05]: If there aren't enough votes for it here in the council, at least people know what direction to go, Mr. President.

1512
02:00:04,705 --> 02:00:06,986
[SPEAKER_05]: So I see no problem bringing the resolution forward.

1513
02:00:07,186 --> 02:00:09,627
[SPEAKER_05]: There were citizens that came here and then asked this council to make a decision.

1514
02:00:09,927 --> 02:00:11,687
[SPEAKER_05]: At that point in time, I wasn't ready to support that.

1515
02:00:11,767 --> 02:00:12,808
[SPEAKER_05]: At this point in time, I am.

1516
02:00:12,988 --> 02:00:13,908
[SPEAKER_05]: I've done a little bit of homework.

1517
02:00:13,948 --> 02:00:15,988
[SPEAKER_05]: I've done a little bit of research on the matter, Mr. President.

1518
02:00:16,449 --> 02:00:19,309
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't think that it's that outlandish.

1519
02:00:19,410 --> 02:00:20,490
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it's crazy.

1520
02:00:20,910 --> 02:00:24,571
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it's insane to bring this conversation topic forward.

1521
02:00:24,591 --> 02:00:30,713
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it's insane, crazy, or outlandish to ask for the question, to be answered by a clerk, Mr. President.

1522
02:00:31,005 --> 02:00:32,686
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of information, Councilor Marks.

1523
02:00:33,647 --> 02:00:39,110
[SPEAKER_11]: I know Councilor Knight is new to the council, but this question has been brought up on several occasions.

1524
02:00:39,871 --> 02:00:49,697
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think some of the surprise is that there's been members of this council adamantly opposed to even looking at the city charter, let alone review it.

1525
02:00:50,197 --> 02:00:51,738
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that's some of the surprise.

1526
02:00:51,758 --> 02:00:53,359
[SPEAKER_11]: I know you're relatively new to the council.

1527
02:00:53,760 --> 02:00:59,063
[SPEAKER_11]: Myself and other members of the council have supported this type of initiative and type of review.

1528
02:00:59,497 --> 02:01:05,223
[SPEAKER_11]: and feel that it should be built into the city charter that calls for a periodical review of the city charter.

1529
02:01:05,263 --> 02:01:07,845
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that's where some of the surprise comes in.

1530
02:01:09,007 --> 02:01:19,377
[SPEAKER_11]: And I offered a resolution, I think it was a year and a half, two years ago, and I won't speak out of turn, but the president at the time, Councilor Dello Russo said,

1531
02:01:19,974 --> 02:01:24,937
[SPEAKER_11]: He has never had anyone approach him regarding the city charter and didn't see a need to even look at it.

1532
02:01:25,698 --> 02:01:28,880
[SPEAKER_11]: And that was, you know, pretty close to a quote that he said.

1533
02:01:28,960 --> 02:01:42,069
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think some of us are concerned now because, you know, when the mayor was in office, there wasn't the feeling by some members of the council to review the charter when the mayor was in power.

1534
02:01:43,029 --> 02:01:46,772
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, and now all of a sudden the mayor is going by the wayside.

1535
02:01:47,393 --> 02:01:51,914
[SPEAKER_11]: And now, all of a sudden, these same members want to take a look at the city charter.

1536
02:01:52,354 --> 02:01:53,875
[SPEAKER_11]: So maybe they had an epiphany.

1537
02:01:53,915 --> 02:01:54,275
[SPEAKER_11]: Who knows?

1538
02:01:55,075 --> 02:01:55,635
[SPEAKER_11]: You know?

1539
02:01:55,675 --> 02:01:57,416
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe you did a good job debating.

1540
02:01:57,516 --> 02:01:58,256
[SPEAKER_11]: And good luck to them.

1541
02:01:58,476 --> 02:02:02,177
[SPEAKER_11]: But I've always been supportive of a charter review for years.

1542
02:02:02,537 --> 02:02:07,218
[SPEAKER_11]: And my record has always been one for looking at the city charter.

1543
02:02:07,258 --> 02:02:09,198
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the way the city government operates.

1544
02:02:09,639 --> 02:02:15,540
[SPEAKER_11]: Any paper that was developed 28 years ago, like any business plan, you wouldn't be in business too long if you had

1545
02:02:15,900 --> 02:02:17,602
[SPEAKER_11]: the business plan from 28 years ago.

1546
02:02:17,922 --> 02:02:19,183
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to change with the times.

1547
02:02:19,784 --> 02:02:27,210
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I welcome this, and I welcome to see how my colleagues that were once opposed to this move forward with this.

1548
02:02:28,031 --> 02:02:35,798
[SPEAKER_05]: And I, too, think that, you know, figuring out what the process is and figuring out what direction we need to go in if we feel as though there are changes necessary is important.

1549
02:02:35,858 --> 02:02:36,679
[SPEAKER_05]: It's important for us to know.

1550
02:02:36,719 --> 02:02:37,640
[SPEAKER_05]: It's important for the people to know.

1551
02:02:37,660 --> 02:02:37,920
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm on board.

1552
02:02:37,940 --> 02:02:41,944
[SPEAKER_05]: And more importantly, I think, with the change in administration, there is a certain

1553
02:02:43,163 --> 02:02:48,207
[SPEAKER_05]: sense of insecurity or a sense of maybe uncertainty and instability right now.

1554
02:02:48,367 --> 02:02:50,548
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that if we're going to make the change, now's the time to do it.

1555
02:02:50,568 --> 02:02:53,691
[SPEAKER_05]: If things are changing, let's really take a long hard look at what's going on.

1556
02:02:53,731 --> 02:02:54,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Point of clarification.

1557
02:02:54,731 --> 02:02:56,513
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of clarification, Councilor Penta.

1558
02:02:56,833 --> 02:03:04,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the Council's sense saying that there is a — when the — at present administration, there was a security sense here, but now there is a sense of insecurity?

1559
02:03:04,879 --> 02:03:05,519
[SPEAKER_05]: I misspoke.

1560
02:03:05,779 --> 02:03:06,400
[SPEAKER_05]: I misspoke.

1561
02:03:06,560 --> 02:03:09,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Instability versus insecurity was the term that I meant to use, Councilor.

1562
02:03:10,182 --> 02:03:11,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's even worse.

1563
02:03:11,813 --> 02:03:18,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you don't think that there's a sense of instability here in the community of Medford right now with the 28-year mayor that's resigning and going, not resigning, I'm sorry, retiring.

1564
02:03:20,959 --> 02:03:25,502
[SPEAKER_05]: There are two good candidates that are going to be in the race over here and hopefully maybe the best woman will win, a man will win.

1565
02:03:26,723 --> 02:03:41,433
[SPEAKER_02]: I really think the people of this community are smart enough to understand and to realize that when this issue has been brought up, as it has been brought up, and I really am going to respectfully ask my colleagues to lay it on the table so that way the people who are watching it can come next week and discuss it,

1566
02:03:41,693 --> 02:03:48,799
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, Councilor De La Rosa, you owe it to the public to come down from the chair and explain why you're putting this resolution on when you were wholeheartedly against it before.

1567
02:03:48,819 --> 02:03:50,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Because this doesn't make any sense.

1568
02:03:51,001 --> 02:03:53,023
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to stand behind that for what you're proffering.

1569
02:03:53,623 --> 02:03:56,985
[SPEAKER_02]: You just can't turn around and put a resolution on and not tell the people why.

1570
02:03:57,266 --> 02:03:59,567
[SPEAKER_02]: This is such a huge, huge issue.

1571
02:03:59,968 --> 02:04:04,991
[SPEAKER_02]: You're talking about the community's charter that you were diabolically opposed to before.

1572
02:04:05,291 --> 02:04:12,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Now all of a sudden, out of the clear blue sky, and I don't know who put this bug in your ear, to have this resolution come before the council.

1573
02:04:14,012 --> 02:04:22,877
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're that much for it, well, then why don't you just have the city solicitor come forward and just tell him, Mr. Solicitor, there seems to be a feeling in the community.

1574
02:04:23,197 --> 02:04:24,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you just come here and explain it?

1575
02:04:25,778 --> 02:04:26,179
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1576
02:04:26,459 --> 02:04:30,041
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think you thought this up on your own, because that would be just too good to be true.

1577
02:04:30,561 --> 02:04:35,824
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact of the matter is, you sat there, and you were against it, same as he was, and same as Councilor Camuso.

1578
02:04:36,084 --> 02:04:37,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, most are to withdraw.

1579
02:04:39,726 --> 02:04:40,026
[SPEAKER_02]: God.

1580
02:04:42,068 --> 02:04:48,573
[SPEAKER_02]: He moved that the paper lay on the table and allow the people to come next week who have an interest on this particular subject matter.

1581
02:04:48,753 --> 02:04:51,656
[SPEAKER_02]: You had an 80 year old gentleman who was walking the streets.

1582
02:04:52,817 --> 02:04:55,619
[SPEAKER_02]: It basically embarrassed them and insulted them at the podium.

1583
02:04:58,501 --> 02:05:00,443
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.

1584
02:05:00,503 --> 02:05:02,865
[SPEAKER_02]: He said things were all right the way they were to me.

1585
02:05:02,885 --> 02:05:05,487
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like saying I'm not going to have you characterize my words.

1586
02:05:05,547 --> 02:05:09,330
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight withdraws his name from the petition.

1587
02:05:09,883 --> 02:05:10,463
[SPEAKER_07]: I leave my name on it.

1588
02:05:10,483 --> 02:05:11,783
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought this was a good thing, Mr. President.

1589
02:05:11,803 --> 02:05:12,664
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought this was a good thing.

1590
02:05:12,724 --> 02:05:14,784
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought this was something that, you know what I mean?

1591
02:05:14,924 --> 02:05:16,685
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a good thing, but I just want to know why.

1592
02:05:16,745 --> 02:05:17,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Why the change?

1593
02:05:17,205 --> 02:05:18,005
[SPEAKER_05]: We can work together.

1594
02:05:18,145 --> 02:05:21,626
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that the future is what we should be focused on as opposed to the past.

1595
02:05:21,666 --> 02:05:28,767
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the motion to table should be withdrawn and that we should send a solicitor and then we can discuss it when it comes back to us.

1596
02:05:28,847 --> 02:05:31,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are you afraid to let people come and talk on it?

1597
02:05:31,268 --> 02:05:32,048
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not at all.

1598
02:05:32,108 --> 02:05:34,469
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll have an answer and we'll discuss it then.

1599
02:05:37,313 --> 02:05:38,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you withdrawing the motion to table?

1600
02:05:38,514 --> 02:05:39,654
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there's people who want to talk.

1601
02:05:39,674 --> 02:05:40,194
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to talk.

1602
02:05:40,214 --> 02:05:42,435
[SPEAKER_07]: You, you.

1603
02:05:42,756 --> 02:05:46,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a motion if the table, if it's, if there's a motion to table.

1604
02:05:46,317 --> 02:05:46,778
[SPEAKER_07]: What is wrong?

1605
02:05:47,938 --> 02:05:49,859
[SPEAKER_07]: Is the motion to table withdrawn, councillor?

1606
02:05:50,299 --> 02:05:53,621
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not, no, I'm not withdrawing it because I. The motion is tabled.

1607
02:05:53,841 --> 02:05:55,602
[SPEAKER_02]: Undebatable motion is tabled.

1608
02:06:05,206 --> 02:06:06,467
[SPEAKER_07]: We will address the records.

1609
02:06:07,240 --> 02:06:09,461
[SPEAKER_07]: But first, I have a update.

1610
02:06:10,001 --> 02:06:16,724
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to, in one moment.

1611
02:06:22,867 --> 02:06:23,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion for approval.

1612
02:06:24,087 --> 02:06:24,868
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

1613
02:06:24,888 --> 02:06:25,748
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

1614
02:06:25,808 --> 02:06:26,629
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

1615
02:06:26,869 --> 02:06:27,589
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion's tabled.

1616
02:06:28,927 --> 02:06:37,551
[SPEAKER_07]: The announcement for the budget hearings next week, I had hoped to receive the printed schedule from the mayor's office this evening.

1617
02:06:37,591 --> 02:06:40,352
[SPEAKER_07]: We just worked it out with Louise Miller this morning.

1618
02:06:40,792 --> 02:06:43,193
[SPEAKER_07]: However, that hasn't come to us yet.

1619
02:06:44,194 --> 02:06:50,777
[SPEAKER_07]: The plan is to begin next Tuesday, the 2nd of June at 5.30.

1620
02:06:52,677 --> 02:06:58,720
[SPEAKER_07]: In my note taking, I failed to take down which departments we're going to take then.

1621
02:06:59,710 --> 02:07:01,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Then Wednesday the 3rd at 6 p.m.

1622
02:07:02,713 --> 02:07:03,794
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I take that back.

1623
02:07:04,554 --> 02:07:07,156
[SPEAKER_07]: Then Tuesday the 9th at 5.30.

1624
02:07:07,256 --> 02:07:15,523
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to have library, health department, and some of the related pieces with that, and bonds and interest.

1625
02:07:16,364 --> 02:07:17,645
[SPEAKER_07]: On Wednesday the 10th at 5.30.

1626
02:07:18,085 --> 02:07:22,949
[SPEAKER_07]: I do not have a note on that.

1627
02:07:23,750 --> 02:07:26,112
[SPEAKER_07]: On the 16th, Tuesday, 5.30, police and fire.

1628
02:07:29,562 --> 02:07:44,548
[SPEAKER_07]: Wednesday the 17th DPW 530 hopefully Thursday the 18th at 6 PM we'll be prepared to take the school department.

1629
02:07:47,309 --> 02:07:53,252
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, then, uh, as it comes out, uh, we'll be able to begin discussion on the council floor, the 23rd.

1630
02:07:54,312 --> 02:07:57,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, and if things need to be continued, we have up till the 30th.

1631
02:07:57,873 --> 02:07:59,214
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the first dates again, please.

1632
02:07:59,555 --> 02:08:02,917
[SPEAKER_07]: I apologize, the first date is Tuesday, June 2nd at 5.30.

1633
02:08:03,237 --> 02:08:12,543
[SPEAKER_07]: The 9th at 5.30, the 10th at 5.30, 16th, 5.30, 17th, 5.30, 18th, 6 p.m.

1634
02:08:14,564 --> 02:08:15,164
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Marks?

1635
02:08:15,184 --> 02:08:18,346
[SPEAKER_11]: I move for reconsideration on the vote that we just took.

1636
02:08:20,407 --> 02:08:21,007
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President?

1637
02:08:21,688 --> 02:08:25,210
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to take, move reconsideration.

1638
02:08:25,230 --> 02:08:26,210
[SPEAKER_07]: The paper that was tabled.

1639
02:08:26,971 --> 02:08:28,752
[SPEAKER_07]: On the charter issue.

1640
02:08:29,355 --> 02:08:33,959
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a few residents that would like to speak on it, and then we can make a motion after that.

1641
02:08:34,679 --> 02:08:37,781
[SPEAKER_07]: So motion for reconsideration to reintroduce it back to the floor.

1642
02:08:38,182 --> 02:08:38,982
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

1643
02:08:39,102 --> 02:08:39,303
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1644
02:08:39,463 --> 02:08:39,983
[SPEAKER_07]: Opposed?

1645
02:08:42,145 --> 02:08:44,727
[SPEAKER_07]: Did members of the public wish to speak on that matter?

1646
02:08:48,213 --> 02:08:48,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening, again.

1647
02:08:49,254 --> 02:08:51,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Anthony D'Antonio, 12 Yale Street in Medford.

1648
02:08:51,876 --> 02:08:59,261
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember how many months ago it was, but I started a committee, just a grassroots committee.

1649
02:09:00,502 --> 02:09:06,307
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have 57 members on it right now of people that were very much interested in reviewing the charter.

1650
02:09:06,327 --> 02:09:09,309
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very important because it's a very old document.

1651
02:09:11,030 --> 02:09:13,372
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that Councilor Penta was on it.

1652
02:09:14,008 --> 02:09:21,830
[SPEAKER_03]: At the initial change from plan E to plan A, there were a lot of amendments left out of it.

1653
02:09:22,730 --> 02:09:29,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Amendments that hurt the citizens of Medford because they weren't getting fair representation for their tax dollars, among other things.

1654
02:09:29,772 --> 02:09:36,273
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do recall when I came before, I had a discussion with Solicitor Rumley, and we had a miscommunication.

1655
02:09:37,168 --> 02:09:39,249
[SPEAKER_03]: And I tried to get to him before he went on vacation.

1656
02:09:39,269 --> 02:09:40,350
[SPEAKER_03]: He took a long weekend.

1657
02:09:40,550 --> 02:09:57,941
[SPEAKER_03]: And I came before the council somewhat unprepared, but the emotion that I was trying to get across was to get a feel from the councillors, would you be amenable to having a commission set up where I believe each one of your councillors can pick somebody to go on the, on the committee or the commission.

1658
02:09:58,942 --> 02:10:00,663
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was shot down four to three.

1659
02:10:02,064 --> 02:10:06,807
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think councillor Marchant voted for it, Penta and Biannalonga.

1660
02:10:08,117 --> 02:10:09,098
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's very important.

1661
02:10:09,218 --> 02:10:12,820
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I know it's an election year and I know, you know, this is the right thing to do.

1662
02:10:12,840 --> 02:10:15,141
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the right thing to do 10 years ago, 15 years ago.

1663
02:10:15,181 --> 02:10:21,185
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, charter should review, be reviewed at least a minimum every five years because things change all the time.

1664
02:10:21,765 --> 02:10:23,546
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wanted to get that straight.

1665
02:10:24,507 --> 02:10:27,489
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are a lot of people from that committee that I started.

1666
02:10:28,309 --> 02:10:32,752
[SPEAKER_03]: There were hundreds that want to see a review of the charter because they don't understand.

1667
02:10:32,852 --> 02:10:36,354
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't understand why what happens here on Tuesday nights happens.

1668
02:10:37,459 --> 02:10:39,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't you have authority to do this?

1669
02:10:39,420 --> 02:10:40,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do we spend this?

1670
02:10:40,240 --> 02:10:42,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do we need to be some changes?

1671
02:10:42,120 --> 02:10:43,341
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to have a balance of power.

1672
02:10:43,621 --> 02:10:45,361
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was a vote taken.

1673
02:10:45,521 --> 02:10:47,462
[SPEAKER_03]: And as I said, it got stuffed four to three.

1674
02:10:47,962 --> 02:10:49,742
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, that's all I wanted to say.

1675
02:10:52,463 --> 02:10:54,144
[SPEAKER_07]: And please state your name and address for the record.

1676
02:10:54,584 --> 02:10:56,484
[SPEAKER_01]: Mario Martin of 18 Benton Road.

1677
02:10:58,085 --> 02:11:01,466
[SPEAKER_01]: A review of the charge is absolutely necessary.

1678
02:11:01,506 --> 02:11:05,307
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that if you use the analogy of an old, outdated computer,

1679
02:11:06,285 --> 02:11:15,272
[SPEAKER_01]: You can start to see that after the computer gets really slow, it's not working, you have to reboot it.

1680
02:11:15,312 --> 02:11:16,232
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to add to it.

1681
02:11:16,272 --> 02:11:17,733
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to upgrade it and update it.

1682
02:11:17,753 --> 02:11:30,123
[SPEAKER_01]: In a fast-evolving, fast-changing society, it's absolutely necessary to change this charter, to see the rules of government, to see how

1683
02:11:32,323 --> 02:11:34,165
[SPEAKER_01]: the charter in general can help society.

1684
02:11:34,265 --> 02:11:36,066
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's absolutely necessary.

1685
02:11:36,086 --> 02:11:49,318
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's time that we start looking at changing the language in it and making sure that we can address issues for the city where this charter isn't really addressing.

1686
02:11:49,398 --> 02:11:50,359
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's all.

1687
02:11:50,599 --> 02:11:50,859
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1688
02:11:50,879 --> 02:11:55,363
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

1689
02:11:55,383 --> 02:11:57,065
[SPEAKER_14]: Could this state name and address for the record?

1690
02:11:57,425 --> 02:11:58,086
[SPEAKER_14]: Michael Agiro.

1691
02:11:58,146 --> 02:11:59,547
[SPEAKER_14]: I live on 18 Pembroke Street.

1692
02:12:00,245 --> 02:12:08,169
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's absolutely essential that we review the charter, but we need to do it in a public forum where people have the opportunity to speak about the pros and cons of different systems.

1693
02:12:09,349 --> 02:12:14,452
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a little disconcerting to me because I review the agenda every night, and I didn't see this item on the agenda.

1694
02:12:14,472 --> 02:12:15,573
[SPEAKER_14]: It kind of surprised me.

1695
02:12:16,353 --> 02:12:23,877
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm all for a charter review, but let's do it in a kind of environment that allows for a diversity of voices from the community to participate.

1696
02:12:24,177 --> 02:12:24,457
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1697
02:12:29,815 --> 02:12:32,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a motion, Councilor Knight?

1698
02:12:32,617 --> 02:12:38,320
[SPEAKER_05]: If I could ask the folks involved with this Chatter Review Commission that's been put together when the next meeting is.

1699
02:12:38,340 --> 02:12:49,386
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm meeting with City Solicitor Romley on Thursday.

1700
02:12:49,406 --> 02:12:53,349
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm talking about Mr. D'Antonio, actually, and to the committee that he was speaking about.

1701
02:12:53,789 --> 02:12:56,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Anthony D'Antonio, Yale Street.

1702
02:12:56,971 --> 02:12:58,111
[SPEAKER_03]: This was an ad hoc committee.

1703
02:13:00,444 --> 02:13:02,965
[SPEAKER_03]: which came about because of the frustration of many citizens.

1704
02:13:03,345 --> 02:13:06,967
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not a, uh, you know, you don't have a charter.

1705
02:13:07,787 --> 02:13:09,888
[SPEAKER_03]: We just was a group of people to met.

1706
02:13:09,948 --> 02:13:12,209
[SPEAKER_05]: I just didn't know if you were meeting again in the near future.

1707
02:13:12,349 --> 02:13:17,472
[SPEAKER_03]: No, because what I, uh, what's happening now is because it's an election year and a lot of people busy with different things.

1708
02:13:18,292 --> 02:13:23,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and I have a couple of other avenues I've been, you know, going down.

1709
02:13:24,995 --> 02:13:29,197
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hoping that the, um, the next administrator, the next mayor in the city of Medford,

1710
02:13:30,382 --> 02:13:32,924
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll understand that this needs to be done, and we'll go along with that.

1711
02:13:33,385 --> 02:13:37,148
[SPEAKER_03]: It's quite an operation to get this thing going.

1712
02:13:37,168 --> 02:13:40,591
[SPEAKER_03]: I think to go the signature way is 5,500 signatures.

1713
02:13:41,131 --> 02:13:43,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Then there's a process with this, that, and the other, and it takes a while.

1714
02:13:43,833 --> 02:13:52,620
[SPEAKER_03]: But as I said, councilors can vote a commission, I believe, if I'm not mistaken, can vote a commission to work on the charter, and it needs a lot of work.

1715
02:13:52,661 --> 02:13:55,623
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of weak spots in the charter.

1716
02:13:55,905 --> 02:14:03,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. D'Antoni, we've put some effort in and done some work on this and, um, you know, having dealt with you, I know that it's going to be good work and it's going to be thorough.

1717
02:14:03,512 --> 02:14:13,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, would you be willing to share that information with the council once we get our response back from the solicitor as to what your notes reflected minute, minute, meeting minutes and stuff like that from the ad hoc committee?

1718
02:14:13,180 --> 02:14:14,381
[SPEAKER_03]: We have some minutes of what we've done.

1719
02:14:14,842 --> 02:14:16,283
[SPEAKER_05]: If you could share that with us, that might be helpful.

1720
02:14:16,303 --> 02:14:16,984
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not in the conversation.

1721
02:14:17,004 --> 02:14:21,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much what we did, what we discussed was the need for the change in the charter or the review of the charter.

1722
02:14:22,704 --> 02:14:35,473
[SPEAKER_03]: And not so much to besmirch the mayor or anything like that, because it's a very fine line when you're trying to work with somebody who's been mayor for 28 years in a charter that's been in existence from the year before he became mayor.

1723
02:14:35,934 --> 02:14:40,657
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a fine line, because there's a lot of different opinions of everything and everybody out there.

1724
02:14:41,518 --> 02:14:45,420
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was difficult, because we shook out the people that just wanted to come in and lambaste the mayor.

1725
02:14:45,480 --> 02:14:46,021
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't do that.

1726
02:14:46,938 --> 02:14:50,019
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, so it's important.

1727
02:14:50,079 --> 02:14:56,062
[SPEAKER_03]: The goal was to get this city back in the, back in the green and the black and everything.

1728
02:14:56,282 --> 02:14:58,463
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think anybody behind this rail is questioning your motives, sir.

1729
02:14:59,063 --> 02:15:04,845
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to clarify some information.

1730
02:15:05,486 --> 02:15:06,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Madam Vice President.

1731
02:15:06,306 --> 02:15:16,330
[SPEAKER_09]: If I can recall too, when it was before the council a number of times and the committee, your committee was started and Mr. Starello was a big advocate, Capucci,

1732
02:15:17,244 --> 02:15:24,970
[SPEAKER_09]: was a big advocate, and I think you had a lot of meetings, and you did a lot of work, and then the council took that vote of three to four, and everything kind of died down after that.

1733
02:15:25,070 --> 02:15:36,999
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe now, if we can uniformly say we need to review the charter, we can move, you know, your committee and the city can move forward with, you know, reviewing the charter and seeing what needs to be changed in the future.

1734
02:15:37,360 --> 02:15:42,464
[SPEAKER_03]: And as I said, it is a committee, ad hoc, and not a commission, not a duly registered commission.

1735
02:15:43,364 --> 02:15:44,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. D'Antonio.

1736
02:15:46,226 --> 02:15:46,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a point.

1737
02:15:47,307 --> 02:15:48,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a motion on the floor?

1738
02:15:48,787 --> 02:16:08,814
[SPEAKER_02]: Point of clarification to those meetings, uh, um, Tony, um, when we were at those meetings, one of the things that were brought up, that was pretty much not clear because a lot of people didn't go back to 30 years when this whole change of government took place way back when it wasn't just a one option issue.

1739
02:16:09,134 --> 02:16:10,114
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a double option.

1740
02:16:10,234 --> 02:16:15,836
[SPEAKER_02]: You could retain the council manager, former government, or you could go forward with the strong AMIA and,

1741
02:16:17,085 --> 02:16:19,647
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people seem to think that that wasn't the way it was.

1742
02:16:19,687 --> 02:16:24,711
[SPEAKER_02]: We had 32 meetings, 32 meetings, open to the public, open and notorious.

1743
02:16:25,551 --> 02:16:32,657
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we had, I believe there was a Charter Review Committee, and then there became a Charter Commission, was elected citywide throughout the community.

1744
02:16:33,418 --> 02:16:38,002
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, I believe it's some year after that, it's a four to five year process.

1745
02:16:38,402 --> 02:16:41,504
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't an overnight thing, and people think it's gonna change overnight.

1746
02:16:42,105 --> 02:16:43,506
[SPEAKER_02]: This is open and notorious.

1747
02:16:43,546 --> 02:16:44,607
[SPEAKER_02]: There were many, many meetings,

1748
02:16:45,270 --> 02:16:51,372
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you digest each and every part of the segments of the charter, that's what this thing was all about, and that's where it was going.

1749
02:16:51,592 --> 02:16:58,134
[SPEAKER_02]: The unfortunate part, even though the vote was four to three, the unfortunate part about many good things were starting to come about.

1750
02:16:58,174 --> 02:17:09,879
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think all we were looking for, all that I guess you guys were looking for at the time, and I was willing to support, was having each council become involved with a citizen, with a committee, and going over it.

1751
02:17:10,919 --> 02:17:13,920
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when the time came to make a presentation, you make a presentation.

1752
02:17:14,559 --> 02:17:15,459
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all that it was.

1753
02:17:15,540 --> 02:17:17,380
[SPEAKER_02]: This wasn't trying to upstage anybody.

1754
02:17:17,981 --> 02:17:18,401
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're right.

1755
02:17:18,801 --> 02:17:21,682
[SPEAKER_02]: This wasn't out there to smash anybody or anything like that.

1756
02:17:21,702 --> 02:17:25,164
[SPEAKER_02]: It was run very logically and very, very courteously.

1757
02:17:25,504 --> 02:17:27,885
[SPEAKER_02]: People expressed their opinions as what they wanted to see.

1758
02:17:28,885 --> 02:17:34,808
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, I just, you know, I still think there are other people out there who would like to come and speak on it.

1759
02:17:35,328 --> 02:17:39,630
[SPEAKER_02]: And just all due respect to my colleagues, I just ask that it lay on the table until next week.

1760
02:17:39,670 --> 02:17:42,091
[SPEAKER_02]: And at least that way, there are people, if they want to come, they come.

1761
02:17:43,005 --> 02:17:44,686
[SPEAKER_02]: At least they had an opportunity to know it's there.

1762
02:17:45,126 --> 02:17:52,248
[SPEAKER_03]: Through the chair to Councilor Penta, I do know the work that you did on the charter, because I read it and re-read it and read it again.

1763
02:17:52,968 --> 02:18:09,334
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do know that they omitted some very important revisions, amendments, clauses in there that sort of shot a whole lot of holes for that charter back then, Plan A. And one of the things people have to know, there were nine members on the commission.

1764
02:18:10,234 --> 02:18:12,455
[SPEAKER_02]: And just like the US Constitution when it was passed,

1765
02:18:13,003 --> 02:18:15,385
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very marginal on each one of them.

1766
02:18:15,465 --> 02:18:17,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Many of them were 5 to 4, 6 to 3.

1767
02:18:17,687 --> 02:18:19,468
[SPEAKER_02]: There weren't many that were really overwhelming.

1768
02:18:20,068 --> 02:18:22,310
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're going to probably find this on this particular issue, too.

1769
02:18:22,550 --> 02:18:23,211
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know something?

1770
02:18:23,791 --> 02:18:30,676
[SPEAKER_02]: This charter to be looked at today is going to be for the benefit of the citizens of tomorrow, for the people who are 20, 30, and 40 years old.

1771
02:18:30,696 --> 02:18:34,299
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're at an age right now, you know, we're living within something that's already there.

1772
02:18:34,619 --> 02:18:35,520
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been established.

1773
02:18:36,405 --> 02:18:43,347
[SPEAKER_02]: But whoever the administrator, and whoever the new council's gonna be, your job isn't for today, your job is how, where this city's gonna be going for tomorrow.

1774
02:18:43,648 --> 02:18:52,110
[SPEAKER_02]: It's direction, and how are we gonna enhance the vitality and rejuvenate this city to a point that's saying, hey, our government is working with us and it's moving forward with us.

1775
02:18:52,711 --> 02:18:57,932
[SPEAKER_02]: And Jeannie, whether it's a brand new police station or not, how we're gonna get there, that's what you need to know.

1776
02:18:58,193 --> 02:19:00,453
[SPEAKER_02]: How it's gonna be financed, that's what you need to know.

1777
02:19:00,833 --> 02:19:02,274
[SPEAKER_02]: You just can't say you want something.

1778
02:19:02,614 --> 02:19:05,255
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how we're gonna do it, and it's gonna be collective, it'll be a collective

1779
02:19:05,562 --> 02:19:11,025
[SPEAKER_02]: that it'll be a cleft of thought process to get to that point, something that's been sort of like missing for a long period of time.

1780
02:19:11,785 --> 02:19:25,191
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully the new council, whoever those Councilors might be, will realize that you do have an important role to play in this city and you're not going to be ostracized and you should be a game player for the future, just like the mayor is going to be a game player for the future.

1781
02:19:25,931 --> 02:19:27,812
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're elected to do the people's business.

1782
02:19:27,832 --> 02:19:30,153
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not elected here to be for ourselves.

1783
02:19:31,034 --> 02:19:32,514
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no personal gain in here for me.

1784
02:19:32,995 --> 02:19:33,835
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll speak for myself.

1785
02:19:34,509 --> 02:19:35,169
[SPEAKER_02]: I love this city.

1786
02:19:35,189 --> 02:19:36,670
[SPEAKER_02]: I've spent a lot of time in this city.

1787
02:19:37,050 --> 02:19:42,273
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been elected for a lot of years, and I'm very thankful to the taxpayers for that and the rate payers and the citizens.

1788
02:19:43,033 --> 02:19:43,714
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know something?

1789
02:19:43,934 --> 02:19:45,014
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a new day dawn.

1790
02:19:45,335 --> 02:19:46,135
[SPEAKER_02]: We're moving forward.

1791
02:19:46,235 --> 02:19:47,456
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going into a new direction.

1792
02:19:48,036 --> 02:19:50,817
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's hopefully, I hope the taxpayers buy into that.

1793
02:19:50,917 --> 02:19:52,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Collaboration breeds success.

1794
02:19:52,378 --> 02:19:53,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it's collaboration.

1795
02:19:53,299 --> 02:19:53,599
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right.

1796
02:19:53,679 --> 02:19:53,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1797
02:19:56,620 --> 02:19:57,161
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Motz.

1798
02:19:57,601 --> 02:20:01,063
[SPEAKER_11]: If I could, just briefly, Mr. President, just because we're talking about the charter.

1799
02:20:03,323 --> 02:20:04,764
[SPEAKER_11]: I had some paperwork at my desk.

1800
02:20:04,804 --> 02:20:07,426
[SPEAKER_11]: It says the two main charter change routes.

1801
02:20:08,527 --> 02:20:11,428
[SPEAKER_11]: Option one, electing a home rule charter commission.

1802
02:20:12,049 --> 02:20:18,893
[SPEAKER_11]: It says option one is an election of a home rule charter commission, which leads to what is often referred to as a home rule charter.

1803
02:20:19,473 --> 02:20:24,436
[SPEAKER_11]: A commission of nine members may be elected to frame a charter or revise its present charter.

1804
02:20:24,937 --> 02:20:30,300
[SPEAKER_11]: For a city or a town upon a petition of 15% of the municipality's voters,

1805
02:20:30,942 --> 02:20:38,783
[SPEAKER_11]: Chapter 43B of the general laws provides a specific framework, timeline, and set of responsibilities for the charter commission to fulfill.

1806
02:20:39,324 --> 02:20:46,865
[SPEAKER_11]: The commission has a maximum of 16 months to produce a preliminary report and a maximum of 18 months to produce a final report.

1807
02:20:47,465 --> 02:20:50,566
[SPEAKER_11]: The statute requires that two public hearings be held.

1808
02:20:50,966 --> 02:20:55,606
[SPEAKER_11]: Both the preliminary and the final reports must be printed and distributed.

1809
02:20:56,887 --> 02:20:58,767
[SPEAKER_11]: Option two is a home rule petition.

1810
02:20:59,532 --> 02:21:03,573
[SPEAKER_11]: route, which leads to what is often referred to as a special act charter.

1811
02:21:04,133 --> 02:21:11,015
[SPEAKER_11]: Section eight of the home rule petition amendment provides that cities and towns may use a home rule petition to achieve change in the structure.

1812
02:21:11,515 --> 02:21:18,237
[SPEAKER_11]: The petition route was the only route available for cities and towns to make structural change prior to the passage of the amendment.

1813
02:21:18,817 --> 02:21:24,059
[SPEAKER_11]: Section eight does not provide detailed instructions regarding the preparation of a home rule petition charter.

1814
02:21:24,559 --> 02:21:27,800
[SPEAKER_11]: A mayor or board of selectmen may appoint a study committee

1815
02:21:28,253 --> 02:21:32,816
[SPEAKER_11]: or such committees may be created by a city council or by a vote of a town meeting.

1816
02:21:33,456 --> 02:21:42,842
[SPEAKER_11]: Such actions may set a timeline for such committees to report back to the appointing a body, but there is no statement requirement for a specific timeline.

1817
02:21:43,162 --> 02:21:46,504
[SPEAKER_11]: There's also no requirement for printing and distribution of any proposal.

1818
02:21:46,944 --> 02:21:54,228
[SPEAKER_11]: There are no public hearing requirements per se, although some study committees do provide a public forum for discussion of its recommendations.

1819
02:21:54,729 --> 02:21:56,690
[SPEAKER_11]: In a town meeting or city council meetings,

1820
02:21:57,201 --> 02:21:59,903
[SPEAKER_11]: which such changes would be considered public meetings.

1821
02:22:00,283 --> 02:22:06,306
[SPEAKER_11]: In recent years, however, some study committees have used the CityTown website as publicized their recommendations.

1822
02:22:07,247 --> 02:22:09,968
[SPEAKER_11]: And then it goes on to say after completing their work and so forth.

1823
02:22:10,389 --> 02:22:21,595
[SPEAKER_11]: Then it also, Mr. President, just if I could, and I assume we're going to get this back from the city solicitor, it says periodic review of a charter by a charter review committee.

1824
02:22:22,315 --> 02:22:25,057
[SPEAKER_11]: Once a community has a charter, there's often a provision

1825
02:22:25,463 --> 02:22:27,925
[SPEAKER_11]: for the periodic appointment of a charter review committee.

1826
02:22:28,425 --> 02:22:33,089
[SPEAKER_11]: The committee undertakes an examination to determine the charter's ongoing utility and accuracy.

1827
02:22:33,629 --> 02:22:39,014
[SPEAKER_11]: Such committees do not have the powers, duties, and responsibilities of an elected charter commission.

1828
02:22:39,574 --> 02:22:53,585
[SPEAKER_11]: Such committees are formed to review the charter and to make recommendations to its appointing body, example, Selectman City Council, regarding the need for additions, deletions, clarifications, or other amendments that would improve the charter.

1829
02:22:54,036 --> 02:22:56,578
[SPEAKER_11]: The term of such an advisory committee is usually one year.

1830
02:22:57,098 --> 02:23:02,902
[SPEAKER_11]: Recommendations of the committee may take the form of a proposal, special act, or proposed charter amendment.

1831
02:23:03,422 --> 02:23:08,285
[SPEAKER_11]: But the local legislative body must act upon the recommendations before they take effect.

1832
02:23:09,006 --> 02:23:16,831
[SPEAKER_11]: The committee may also find, for example, that the charter's intent is clear, but related bylaws or ordinances may need clarification.

1833
02:23:17,311 --> 02:23:22,154
[SPEAKER_11]: The role of such committees can be important in ensuring that the charter is working as intended

1834
02:23:22,622 --> 02:23:28,725
[SPEAKER_11]: but the charter review committee has no assigned role in achieving any change beyond recommendation to the appointing body.

1835
02:23:29,326 --> 02:23:51,258
[SPEAKER_11]: And if I recall, uh, the discussion we had, um, the periodic review of the city charter by this creation, Mr. President of this charter review committee was the most expedient way of getting a community body to make recommendations to the council and the council having a public hearing and discussing and debating all the issues.

1836
02:23:52,128 --> 02:23:58,052
[SPEAKER_11]: And we could discuss this further, but I think that outlines the process that we, as a body, have.

1837
02:23:58,613 --> 02:24:02,015
[SPEAKER_11]: And we do have, you know, this information at our fingertips.

1838
02:24:02,715 --> 02:24:07,058
[SPEAKER_11]: And I look forward to more dialogue and discussion on this, Mr. President.

1839
02:24:10,060 --> 02:24:11,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor, do you happen to have a site on that?

1840
02:24:12,722 --> 02:24:13,843
[SPEAKER_05]: For which one?

1841
02:24:14,143 --> 02:24:15,924
[SPEAKER_05]: The document you just read off of.

1842
02:24:15,984 --> 02:24:18,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a website or some certain?

1843
02:24:21,662 --> 02:24:25,024
[SPEAKER_11]: The first option refers to Chapter 43B of the Mass General Laws.

1844
02:24:26,465 --> 02:24:35,970
[SPEAKER_11]: The second one refers to Section 8, which I assume is part of that 43B.

1845
02:24:37,511 --> 02:24:39,232
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't give a chapter, but it gives a section.

1846
02:24:39,993 --> 02:24:42,274
[SPEAKER_11]: And the periodic review is somewhere mixed in there.

1847
02:24:42,314 --> 02:24:43,454
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no site to that.

1848
02:24:43,715 --> 02:24:43,895
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

1849
02:24:44,055 --> 02:24:44,535
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor.

1850
02:24:44,555 --> 02:24:44,975
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate it.

1851
02:24:47,817 --> 02:24:48,657
[SPEAKER_07]: All set, Councilor Marks?

1852
02:24:48,757 --> 02:24:49,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1853
02:24:49,158 --> 02:24:49,658
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, thank you.

1854
02:24:50,673 --> 02:24:51,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Penta.

1855
02:24:52,514 --> 02:24:59,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, um, I'm going to apologize to you because, um, I think we've seen it and heard enough here tonight.

1856
02:25:00,739 --> 02:25:07,763
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand when you come out, you know what I'm going to ask you to do if you don't mind, would you just withdraw your motion and put it legitimately on the agenda for next week?

1857
02:25:07,903 --> 02:25:14,127
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that way there it's open and notorious and then everybody can discuss it because I think it can accomplish the same thing.

1858
02:25:14,147 --> 02:25:17,809
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the same time, it's just such an important issue.

1859
02:25:18,317 --> 02:25:19,958
[SPEAKER_02]: to have it come under suspension of the rules.

1860
02:25:19,978 --> 02:25:23,560
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think, can I, can I explain why I did what I did?

1861
02:25:26,161 --> 02:25:31,204
[SPEAKER_07]: I put it in so we can get an opinion back from the solicitor.

1862
02:25:32,045 --> 02:25:35,267
[SPEAKER_07]: So therefore we could have a point of discussion.

1863
02:25:36,027 --> 02:25:38,288
[SPEAKER_07]: That's an authoritative document before us.

1864
02:25:39,069 --> 02:25:39,869
[SPEAKER_02]: And I appreciate that.

1865
02:25:39,949 --> 02:25:46,313
[SPEAKER_07]: Never my intention Councilor to, uh, eliminate limit,

1866
02:25:47,445 --> 02:25:52,308
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, prevent or obstruct or obscure discussion on this.

1867
02:25:53,208 --> 02:26:01,772
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a beginning to get an opinion on how we go about this from the legal advisor to this council so we can begin the next steps.

1868
02:26:02,373 --> 02:26:03,253
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can appreciate that.

1869
02:26:03,293 --> 02:26:07,155
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, it's such, it's, it's, it's the thing that makes this city run.

1870
02:26:07,475 --> 02:26:12,037
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's charter and you know, and if it was on the agenda, there'd be no, I'd have no problem with it.

1871
02:26:12,057 --> 02:26:15,579
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just, you know, it just reflects me back to the 43 vote.

1872
02:26:16,280 --> 02:26:17,020
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to understand,

1873
02:26:17,639 --> 02:26:19,200
[SPEAKER_02]: You're in one position and I'm in another.

1874
02:26:19,520 --> 02:26:22,441
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think we're on the same page as far as getting an opinion.

1875
02:26:22,501 --> 02:26:23,321
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what I'm saying.

1876
02:26:24,001 --> 02:26:28,223
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't mind withdrawing it and just putting it on the agenda for next week, I would be more than happy with that.

1877
02:26:28,243 --> 02:26:28,963
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be OK.

1878
02:26:31,985 --> 02:26:37,507
[SPEAKER_06]: I see no reason why I'm asking for an opinion and still having a discussion once we get there.

1879
02:26:37,527 --> 02:26:41,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, because there are other people who were actively involved that might want to come and speak.

1880
02:26:41,488 --> 02:26:43,369
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want them to have an opportunity.

1881
02:26:43,389 --> 02:26:45,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Under suspension.

1882
02:26:45,530 --> 02:26:46,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Under suspension.

1883
02:26:47,204 --> 02:26:48,485
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not on the agenda, you know?

1884
02:26:48,505 --> 02:26:49,746
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand that.

1885
02:26:49,766 --> 02:26:53,549
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand that because it came to mind over the long weekend.

1886
02:26:54,349 --> 02:26:55,990
[SPEAKER_07]: And I wanted to just get a legal opinion.

1887
02:26:56,911 --> 02:27:02,135
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, but at the same time, Freddy, if I lay it on the table and it wins, it sits there for another week.

1888
02:27:02,175 --> 02:27:05,517
[SPEAKER_02]: But if it's on the agenda next week, it doesn't make any difference.

1889
02:27:05,557 --> 02:27:06,458
[SPEAKER_02]: At least it's open.

1890
02:27:06,498 --> 02:27:07,278
[SPEAKER_02]: People can see it.

1891
02:27:07,298 --> 02:27:09,660
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll withdraw it and place it on the agenda.

1892
02:27:09,840 --> 02:27:10,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

1893
02:27:11,001 --> 02:27:11,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1894
02:27:11,601 --> 02:27:12,322
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that.

1895
02:27:12,602 --> 02:27:13,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion is withdrawn.

1896
02:27:19,173 --> 02:27:19,973
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a question for you all.

1897
02:27:20,013 --> 02:27:26,236
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you're aware of this, but I was driving down commercial street the other day and I noticed the catch basin contractor dumping the contents of their truck

1898
02:27:40,633 --> 02:27:45,494
[SPEAKER_03]: in one of the bays at the dpw yard where we formally leased the building over there.

1899
02:27:45,994 --> 02:27:50,895
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if we're still under the regulations, the rules and regulations of the lease, have we bought it out?

1900
02:27:51,435 --> 02:27:55,656
[SPEAKER_03]: And if so, if that's listed as hazardous material, are we going to be responsible for that?

1901
02:27:56,356 --> 02:28:02,217
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't know what the catchphrases of dirt and rocks and all kinds of garbage.

1902
02:28:02,257 --> 02:28:02,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Over the weekend.

1903
02:28:05,398 --> 02:28:06,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, good.

1904
02:28:08,477 --> 02:28:08,757
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1905
02:28:09,097 --> 02:28:12,318
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I was just concerned because it's very unsightly.

1906
02:28:12,498 --> 02:28:13,358
[SPEAKER_03]: So, okay.

1907
02:28:13,378 --> 02:28:13,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1908
02:28:15,158 --> 02:28:16,159
[SPEAKER_03]: It does smell bad.

1909
02:28:16,459 --> 02:28:18,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we still, are we still indebted to that?

1910
02:28:19,019 --> 02:28:22,600
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1911
02:28:22,740 --> 02:28:23,080
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1912
02:28:23,940 --> 02:28:26,741
[SPEAKER_07]: The records of the May 19th meeting were passed to Councilor Marks.

1913
02:28:26,781 --> 02:28:27,881
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor, how did you find them?

1914
02:28:28,501 --> 02:28:30,462
[SPEAKER_07]: Through the records, Mr. President, I find them to be in order.

1915
02:28:30,502 --> 02:28:31,102
[SPEAKER_07]: Move approve.

1916
02:28:31,442 --> 02:28:33,722
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Councilor Marks for approval of the records.

1917
02:28:33,762 --> 02:28:34,462
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

1918
02:28:34,482 --> 02:28:34,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

1919
02:28:35,122 --> 02:28:35,923
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

1920
02:28:35,963 --> 02:28:37,603
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion the records.

1921
02:28:38,369 --> 02:28:39,049
[SPEAKER_07]: are approved.

1922
02:28:39,290 --> 02:28:40,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to adjourn.

1923
02:28:40,430 --> 02:28:41,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

1924
02:28:43,512 --> 02:28:45,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, they remain on the table.

1925
02:28:46,034 --> 02:28:47,315
[SPEAKER_02]: One last thing, in all seriousness.

1926
02:28:48,335 --> 02:28:56,340
[SPEAKER_02]: I want my council colleagues to call me, because I am really impassioned about this issue regarding achata.

1927
02:28:56,360 --> 02:29:04,145
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to apologize to you, because I just was looking at you as being probably a naysayer back then.

1928
02:29:04,695 --> 02:29:06,396
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can understand where you're coming from now.

1929
02:29:06,616 --> 02:29:07,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing with Councilor Camuso.

1930
02:29:07,816 --> 02:29:09,697
[SPEAKER_02]: He was dead set against it, but that's beside the point.

1931
02:29:10,198 --> 02:29:12,959
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact of the matter is, um, you're the one that's standing up there.

1932
02:29:12,979 --> 02:29:15,460
[SPEAKER_02]: So I apologize, but I thank you for withdrawing.

1933
02:29:15,480 --> 02:29:17,581
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thank you for putting it on the agenda next week.

1934
02:29:17,741 --> 02:29:20,662
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, it's probably the most important thing that makes the city run.

1935
02:29:20,742 --> 02:29:21,283
[SPEAKER_02]: It's charter.

1936
02:29:22,863 --> 02:29:23,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1937
02:29:23,204 --> 02:29:23,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor.

1938
02:29:23,724 --> 02:29:24,504
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome.

1939
02:29:24,964 --> 02:29:32,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, Mr. President, I asked her when we adjourned, we adjourned in the memory of, uh, deceased brothers and sisters from the Medford police department, Robert B Corrado, Kenneth J Hickey,

1940
02:29:33,513 --> 02:29:39,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Adrian L. Jean, Peter W. McGaffigan Jr., Christopher Risano, Thomas J. Walsh, and Sheila Richard.

1941
02:29:39,404 --> 02:29:42,230
[SPEAKER_07]: And they will be remembered at Mass when, Councilor?

1942
02:29:42,550 --> 02:29:44,013
[SPEAKER_05]: Friday the 29th at 9 a.m.

1943
02:29:44,073 --> 02:29:45,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Immaculate Conception Church, Malden.

1944
02:29:46,057 --> 02:29:46,798
