    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6.096s">The</a>  19th regular meeting of the Medford City Council will come to order. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=9.798s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=47.458s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Camuso.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=52.701s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=53.561s">I'd</a>  like to make a motion to take paper <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=60.148s">15-460</a>  off the table and refer it to Committee of the Whole.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=64.732s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Camuso to take Chapter 15-460 off the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=70.456s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=71.717s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=73.018s">Carries.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=73.398s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Camuso to send it to the Committee of the Whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=76.201s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=77.001s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=78.222s">It</a>  was sent to Committee of the Whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=80.964s">While</a>  we're under suspension, Councilor, Vice President, Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=84.887s">If</a>  we can take <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=87.649s">Paper</a>  one, under motions, orders, and resolutions, paper 15-497. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=91.15s">Out</a>  of order, please.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=95.811s">On</a>  the motion of Vice President Logan Kern to take 15-497 out of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=101.172s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=102.233s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=103.793s">The</a>  motion carries. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=105.353s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please mark Councilor Knight as present. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=108.914s">Not</a>  as president. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=111.457s">present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=112.758s">Uh,</a>  15 for 97 offered by vice president Longo current and Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=117.94s">Be</a>  it resolved that the Medford city council request that the city administration report back to the council with regards to what, if anything has been done regarding the flight patterns from Logan airport, be it further resolved that Massport representative, uh, with Medford's appointment to the Massport community advisory board appeared before the Medford city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=139.318s">Madam</a>  Vice President, is any of this related to the buzzing of method we've had from the Blue Angels today?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=145.162s">No,</a>  not today. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=147.323s">Thank</a>  you, President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=149.685s">Myself</a>  and actually Council Marks put this on the agenda because the entire council, I believe, has been getting a number of complaints from residents who are hearing the airplanes coming from Logan Airport. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=163.579s">above</a>  their heads, whether their windows are open or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=166.72s">It's</a>  disturbing sleep. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=168.021s">It's</a>  disturbing quality of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=169.942s">A</a>  lot of it's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=172.063s">I</a>  hear complaints from West Medford and from the Medford Heights. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=176.645s">And</a>  we actually have a resident here to speak tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=179.546s">So</a>  I would like her to come up and explain what's going on in her neighborhood, which is actually close to my neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=187.389s">I</a>  also wanted to bring it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=189.338s">Because</a>  it is hard to get answers from Massport. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=192.179s">It's</a>  hard to know exactly what our administration is doing with regards to these complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=197.761s">I</a>  think the people need answers, and I think we need, whether it's a number of studies that can be done, analysis, analyzing the situation to make sure that we try to get some resolve for our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=215.16s">brought</a>  up the issue recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=216.64s">Actually,</a>  May 7th is the article that I read from Somerville, actually forwarded to me by somebody else who was complaining in the West Medford area. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=225.102s">So</a>  the Board of Aldermen sought answers to aircraft noise issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=232.303s">They</a>  actually are researching flight patterns, or asking that it be researched, flight patterns and the number of residents affected be analyzed and be compared with other runways and communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=244.343s">I</a>  read it further. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=245.283s">I</a>  did some research online. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=246.604s">I</a>  know that an article was in the Medford Patch last year, 2014, at which time Massport stated they were going to do a one-year study. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=256.346s">So</a>  I'd like to, you know, further amend my resolve and ask that we get any results from that Massport study. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=268.928s">I</a>  don't know if Council Member Marx has anything else to add, but it seems like the <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=273.513s">Flight</a>  patterns have doubled, and there's also an issue with the lane. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=278.395s">It's</a>  hard to understand, but the lane that was opened, which is Logan's runway 33 left, or R33L. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=287.22s">It's</a>  the airport's last major runway to receive RNAV. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=292.482s">And</a>  planes that take off are using this new runway to fly over areas such as East Boston, Chelsea, Everett, Cambridge, Somerville, and Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=300.156s">That</a>  opened June 2013, and I think that's the beginning of when the complaints started here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=306.539s">And</a>  I know last year, around this time, is when we started to get the complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=310.762s">They</a>  kind of die off. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=311.722s">When</a>  all the windows close, people start going inside their homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=315.724s">So</a>  for November, December, they start dying off. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=318.426s">And</a>  now, all of a sudden, we're getting the complaints again. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=320.847s">And</a>  we're getting people who can't enjoy their backyards, or they can't even watch TV with their windows open, because these flights are every two minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=329.173s">at</a>  least you're seeing an airplane fly over. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=333.776s">So</a>  I would, I would like to join in on what the city of Somerville is trying to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=338.399s">There's</a>  no reason why Medford can't analyze and strategize and draft their own recommendations to Massport or ask for answers so that we can, you know, figure out if there's a way that we can lessen the inconvenience to our residents.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=353.128s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=353.529s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=355.05s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=356.661s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=357.622s">And</a>  I want to thank Councilwoman Wango Kern for her resolution and her comments she just made. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=364.766s">This</a>  has been an ongoing issue for a number of years in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=368.368s">I</a>  know there's been several resolutions before this council asking the administration to look into why the increase of air traffic over our community, what can be done on behalf of the many residents and the many different neighborhoods <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=385.463s">You</a>  would think that it only impacts certain areas of the city, but the complaints I'm receiving go from South Method to North Method to Wellington to West Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=394.325s">It</a>  really covers the entire city, and the disturbance is citywide. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=401.207s">I</a>  had the opportunity to go onto the Massport website, and they list noise disturbance by community for each year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=412.169s">And</a>  this year, which is year to date, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=415.078s">January</a>  to April, there was 71 complaints from Method residents and 29 callers that called up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=424.482s">So</a>  the numbers, you know, I think speak volume to having someone go find the number to call, first of all, because it's such a concern and impacting their daily life that we really, as a community, need to act upon this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=445.327s">also</a>  took the liberty because the Community Advisory Committee, which is a committee that was created some years back, it's not under the auspice of Massport, but it's a separate body comprised of a resident from each of the impacted areas in a certain radius from Logan Airport. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=469.152s">And</a>  our representative that was appointed by the mayor, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=473.553s">She's</a>  been on a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=474.914s">Her</a>  name is Yelena, and I'll spell the last name. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=478.977s">It's</a>  S-H-U-L-K-I-N-A. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=481.479s">I</a>  think it's Shokina. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=483.74s">And</a>  she is the Method CAC, Community Advisory Committee member. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=489.965s">And</a>  I'd like to give out her email address, Mr. President, because I think residents that have concerns should know who they can talk to, who is the representative from our community <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=501.748s">that</a>  is representing every resident in this community when these board meetings take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=508.27s">And</a>  they're the ones that have impact, that sit down with Massport and sit down with the FAA and are able to affect change on flight patents, on noise from planes, and a host of issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=521.935s">And</a>  her email address is LZLAT. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=528.431s">sman</a>  at yahoo.com. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=533.314s">And</a>  if you don't have access to email, a phone number is 781-395-1471. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=542.961s">And</a>  again, Yelena is our community person on the Community Advisory Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=549.766s">And</a>  I think it's only appropriate that residents that have concern, I think it was a couple years ago, Mr. President, I offered a resolution <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=558.265s">requesting</a>  that Yelena appear before the council and update us on anything that was taking place within the advisory board. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=566.967s">And</a>  I didn't get any response, nor did Yelena ever appear before this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=572.308s">The</a>  president of CAC, the Community Advisory Committee, is a woman by the name of Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=578.229s">Sandra</a>  Kuntz, K-U-N-Z. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=581.929s">And</a>  she's the president of this, I believe, 30-member board that makes recommendations <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=586.804s">And</a>  her email address is skunz at verizon.net. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=594.23s">And</a>  she is the president of the board and I guess was instrumental in putting together this citizen advisory board back some years ago because of the issues she had in her home community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=606.38s">Just</a>  to touch upon what Councilor Lungo-Koehn mentioned about what's taking place with the Boston Logan Airport noise study. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=616.373s">They</a>  refer to it as BLANS, B-L-A-N-S. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=619.575s">And</a>  it was supposedly a three-phase approach to addressing some of the concerns that have been mentioned by area communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=630.079s">And</a>  if I could, off the website, it says, this is the largest FAA-funded noise study in the nation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=637.963s">The</a>  total dollar value for the study is approximately $8.3 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=642.816s">80%,</a>  6.6 million, is funded by airport improvement program grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=648.677s">And</a>  then the remaining is 1.7 million, which is funded by Massport. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=656.239s">And</a>  the first phase of the project was culminated in October 2007 with an environmental report done and given to FAA with recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=671.142s">The</a>  second phase <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=672.712s">was</a>  called the Boston Logan Airport Noise Study. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=675.814s">It</a>  began in 2007 and was completed in December 2012 with final results documented. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=682.958s">And</a>  I think that's what Councilor Lungo-Koehn just mentioned, that she'd like to get a copy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=686.68s">And</a>  I went on the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=688.001s">I</a>  couldn't find it.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=688.601s">I</a>  couldn't find it either.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=689.301s">I</a>  couldn't find it anywhere, the final recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=692.703s">And</a>  I'd also like to make as part of the report, Mr. President, that we can find out what input our community representative had or what <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=701.293s">offerings</a>  our community representative had, if any, towards this particular report. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=707.437s">And</a>  the third phase, which began in July 2013, will identify and evaluate potential runway use measures to be included in a runway use program to replace the preferential runway advisory system. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=722.007s">The</a>  vote CAC took was in 2012, and this was to abate <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=730.127s">uh,</a>  runway noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=731.768s">So,</a>  um, I think if we can get some feedback from the advisory committee member, it would be very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=738.952s">We've</a>  also, I believe a couple of years back, us representatives from Massport to appear before the council, uh, maybe because we're not in the immediate vicinity, uh, like we've Aaron Winthrop, uh, they pay no attention to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=751.74s">But</a>  this is, uh, an issue that, uh, this council has been behind from day one, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=757.995s">And</a>  I'd like to see the administration take a more active role in this issue because it does impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=764.0s">When</a>  I know in Wellington, when I'm standing in my driveway and I can read the numbers on the bottom of the belly of the airplane, you know they're low. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=772.167s">You</a>  have good eyes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=773.968s">No,</a>  these planes are low. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=775.25s">It's</a>  not my eyes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=776.13s">They're</a>  low. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=777.531s">And,</a>  you know, when your home shakes, when they go over, you tend to say to yourself, what are the requirements that would put us in an issue where <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=786.969s">maybe</a>  we could get some mitigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=788.87s">What</a>  do you need? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=789.49s">When</a>  my home shakes, is that enough? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=793.812s">You</a>  know, I'm not sure, but I was told that they have noise detectors throughout our community and that we don't reach the FAA requirements to have mitigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=806.559s">Maybe</a>  those standards could be lowered. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=808.099s">Maybe</a>  it's about time we look at other areas that are being impacted and seeing where these particular devices are located. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=816.116s">In</a>  my opinion, Mr. President, something needs to be done.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=819.239s">And-</a>  I know Massport did a mitigation project several years ago, maybe within the past four years, of window replacement in Chelsea and East Boston.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=828.468s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=828.829s">And,</a>  you know, we may not be at that level, but we were close to a level where I was told also that they were looking at other routes to go over the Mystic and <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=840.904s">and</a>  take the planes in a different area rather than over our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=845.065s">And</a>  I believe that that was taking place, but I haven't seen much in regards to that because I still, on Sunday mornings, you can almost set your watch by it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=857.169s">You</a>  know, when they're coming overhead at 6.30 in the morning, you know, it's going to last three hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=861.69s">Then</a>  certain nights, you'll hear them, you know, at 6, 7 o'clock at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=865.871s">So</a>  it's, like I said, it's throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=869.468s">And</a>  again, I want to thank Councilor Lungo for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=873.13s">And</a>  the residents, I know there's a resident that wants to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=875.771s">The</a>  number of residents that have been sending emails to this council and to this administration to help resolve this important quality of life issue, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=886.196s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=887.117s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilors Lungo and Marks, as amended by both Councilors Lungo and Marks, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=896.373s">Madam</a>  Vice President.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=897.273s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=897.834s">Briefly,</a>  if we could, if we could actually ask the Medford's rep to come again, I know maybe send her an email or a letter in the mail. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=907.178s">I</a>  think that's probably somebody getting somebody from the board is going to, we're going to learn a lot more that way than trying to do our research and ask the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=913.9s">So</a>  if we could ask again, that would be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=917.742s">And</a>  I know it back in 2013, Logan airport adopted a straight line, a way of approaching the airport, which was, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=925.355s">They</a>  used to do a roundabout way, which is one of the reasons why planes are flying lower. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=930.298s">The</a>  Federal Aviation Administration, which uses radar approach points, allow planes to fly, within the last two years, shorter distances, which reduce fuel usage and carbon emissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=943.545s">So</a>  there is a reason why. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=945.527s">Planes</a>  are definitely flying low. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=947.268s">There</a>  is a reason why we're getting these complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=949.289s">And</a>  therefore, there's a reason for the study and the money being spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=953.39s">to</a>  make sure the decibels are within normal ranges. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=957.092s">Because</a>  if you're researching online, too, a lot of things that I found today and yesterday that were popping up were health risks and detrimental effects that this noise level can have on a human being. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=970.141s">So</a>  I would like to obviously get that report on that one-year study and definitely see if we can get any report on any other studies that are having to do with any of the noise levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=981.288s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=982.26s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Vice President.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=983.681s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=985.102s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=986.603s">Madam</a>  Vice President, Councilor Marks, thank you very much for your remarks on this topic as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=990.726s">I</a>  think it's all well and good that we can bring a member of the CAC in here to discuss the flight patents, but Massport also has an Office of Community Relations, and they also have an Office of Government Affairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1003.134s">And</a>  I'd like to amend the resolution to ask that Jose Maceo, who would be the Community Relations Director, and Nancy Donahue, the Assistant Director of Government Affairs, also be invited. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1012.207s">to</a>  a meeting to discuss the flight patents. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1013.889s">Mr.</a>  President, I think it would be very productive to have all parties involved.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1016.972s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1017.812s">So</a>  on the motion of Vice President Lombo-Kern and Councilor Marks, as amended by both, and Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1025.239s">Sir,</a>  you wish to speak on this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1026.941s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1028.422s">Good</a>  evening.</p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1029.303s">I</a>  do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1029.623s">My</a>  name is Michael Ruggiero. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1030.644s">I</a>  live on 18 Pembroke Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1033.107s">As</a>  Councilor Lombo-Kern mentioned, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1037.228s">With</a>  the installation of the virtual runway, 33L, when there is a northwest-heading wind in Logan, we can receive up to two flights every minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1047.151s">The</a>  flights are heaviest often at night when there is a northwest wind into Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1052.452s">There's</a>  a number of different groups that are involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1055.553s">One</a>  of the information that I'm reading right now, just to give people a heads up that are listening at home, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1061.648s">If</a>  you go to bostonwestfairskies.com, there's a number of listing of information about the flight paths. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1075.698s">As</a>  a father of a nine-month-old baby, I can tell you it can be pretty extreme living. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1081.062s">And</a>  we live at the convergence. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1082.543s">Medford</a>  is the convergence of five different paths. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1086.265s">So</a>  it's not that there are just so many more people flying into Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1090.567s">It's</a>  that the people that are flying to Boston are going on fewer and fewer paths, and they're all converging onto Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1096.128s">So,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1098.089s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1098.929s">Uh,</a>  Councilor Camuso.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1101.409s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1101.89s">And,</a>  um, I can certainly understand the frustrations. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1104.65s">My</a>  home is right, uh, right underneath one of the paths and it seems like every weekend it's, uh, it's, it's coming from like the Winchester line right over, uh, the large Memorial hospital and, uh, into Logan. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1115.813s">And,</a>  uh, it is, it is, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1119.245s">It's</a>  louder some days than others. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1120.587s">When</a>  the bigger planes, the 747s, are either taking off or landing, it's a lot louder than some of the smaller A320s and some of them double-engine planes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1131.395s">I</a>  certainly agree with the resolve in looking in to see if there's some mitigation money out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1135.459s">But</a>  I also am very cognizant of the fact that Massport's first and most top priority is for the safety of the flights in and out of Logan Airport. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1144.546s">And</a>  I'm sure they'll work with us any way they can. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1147.112s">But</a>  this is a catch-22, this situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1150.214s">For</a>  the same reason people are paying a large amount of money for their homes here in our community, it's because of its proximity to Boston, to the airport, to the financial district, and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1162.72s">So</a>  it's sort of a catch-22, shall we say. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1165.122s">I</a>  know Councilor Marks championed this issue many years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1168.303s">He</a>  was on the front page of the Boston Herald. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1170.325s">I</a>  think it was the Herald, was it, Councilor? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1173.286s">With</a>  this very particular matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1175.165s">And</a>  as I said in my conversations with Massport officials at the time, and that was about three or four years ago, I believe, more than that, as Councilor Mark says, they understand the frustrations. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1187.03s">And</a>  if we do meet a threshold in certain areas of the community, then there is sometimes funding out there to do mitigation within the homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1197.575s">I</a>  know Winthrop receives a lot of money for the homes right in Winthrop, East Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1204.369s">But</a>  like I said, unfortunately, this is, and I don't want to underestimate the severity of the noise, believe me, because I understand it wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1217.437s">I</a>  have a five-year-old, but I also am very cognizant of the fact that it is seven miles from Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1227.883s">And</a>  this is one thing that we have to expect, maybe not with the volume, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1231.892s">But</a>  Boston, it's an international airport. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1235.513s">It's</a>  not like Lawrence or Hyannis Airport, where you get flights every so often. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1240.095s">We're</a>  an international airport. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1241.515s">You</a>  look at these planes, and they are low. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1243.256s">You</a>  can read them, Lufthansa, Alitalia, and things of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1247.997s">So</a>  I'm more concerned about the safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1251.098s">Like</a>  I said, quite frankly, right after September 11th in the year 2001, there was an airline accident that happened right in New York. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1261.146s">and</a>  it wasn't terrorist, it was mechanical failure or something of that nature, but it was, it landed under mechanical distress or whatever it was in a very populated area that was homes and things of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1277.256s">So</a>  as I understand it, and the other thing is too, as the gentleman that comes up here weekly with his little tablet looking up webpages said so eloquently, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1288.598s">He</a>  alluded to the fact of the winds. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1292.041s">The</a>  planes have to take off into the wind in order to get off the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1297.064s">So</a>  with that being said, a lot of the takeoffs are predicated upon the wind and the weather and all that too. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1305.971s">But</a>  I certainly do agree with the studies that Councilor Marks brought up years ago and Councilor Lungo-Koehn again this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1312.456s">So</a>  I do support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1314.297s">But</a>  I just, as I stated, I'm not going to repeat the will, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1319.387s">And</a>  I've heard that many people in the community this weekend at the coffee shop stated, because they read the council agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1324.83s">And</a>  they were a little bit like, hey, when I moved to Medford from Salem, Mass., I knew I was paying $575,000 for my home to get closer to Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1335.374s">And</a>  this was one of the setbacks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1338.576s">But</a>  I certainly understand all the frustrations out there.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1341.177s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1342.337s">Councilor</a>  Karafiello. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1343.578s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1345.078s">Now</a>  that the nice weather's out, and everyone's out, and the yards and the windows are open, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1349.035s">You're</a>  hearing the noise a lot more than you did over the winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1350.936s">I</a>  don't know how many people know, but over the next two to three years, there's going to be 11 more international airlines flying into Logan Airport. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1360.262s">And</a>  they're flying in with those bigger planes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1362.144s">So</a>  the problem is only going to get worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1364.445s">It's</a>  not going to get better. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1365.686s">So</a>  I think it's time that we do get the study out there and get somebody in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1370.93s">Because</a>  as I said, the problem is just going to continue to grow.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1374.992s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1376.565s">Ma'am,</a>  please state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[50f-AMbGHtg_SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1379.768s">Ann</a>  Donati, 29 Gaston Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1381.97s">D-O-N-A-T-I.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1390.023s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1390.824s">So</a>  last summer, I thought all the airplane noise was in my head, that I was just imagining all the noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1398.57s">And</a>  then I saw the front page of the transcript, residents hear the roar. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1402.714s">I</a>  read that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1403.714s">And</a>  then I saw a few news segments on Channel 5 and some of the news stations about the airplane noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1412.101s">So</a>  I said, it's not in my head. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1413.342s">So</a>  I started to file complaints with Massport. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1417.245s">And</a>  then they send you these little notices. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1419.39s">which</a>  basically are useless and say, yes, you are affected by the noise, which I don't think is very helpful, as opposed to saying, we'll try to do this, we'll try to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1429.896s">So</a>  anyway, when it started up this, the beginning of May, that's when I started emailing the city council, filing more complaints with Massport, and I've been keeping a log of all the noise, and it started on April 30th, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1447.848s">and</a>  it's 10 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1448.769s">to</a>  midnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1449.789s">It's</a>  5.30 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1452.411s">May</a>  19th, it was 12.30 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1454.433s">to</a>  1.30 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1457.415s">This</a>  noise has to stop, especially at these hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1461.818s">I</a>  mean, people have to get up to go to work, and I cannot have these jetliners literally right over my house, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1473.981s">This</a>  is how close they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1475.202s">They</a>  are right over my house at all these hours at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1479.525s">And</a>  I feel like the bomb's going to drop. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1483.327s">This</a>  is a night picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1484.888s">But</a>  I'm beside myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1489.711s">I</a>  have new windows in my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1492.533s">I</a>  would like to have my windows open. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1495.275s">I</a>  understand that when we had winter storms, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1500.805s">used</a>  to come fly over the houses, you know, to avoid the ocean. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1504.188s">I</a>  understand all that, but this on a regular basis has to stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1510.374s">It's</a>  insane. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1512.135s">And</a>  I don't know what else to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1515.238s">But</a>  I'm glad that everybody is <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1517.983s">you</a>  know, paying attention to it, trying to nip it in the bud. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1522.624s">But</a>  I don't think the resolution to give people new windows is going to help because, like you said, it's just going to get worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1532.347s">So</a>  we need to nip this in the bud. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1535.67s">And</a>  if anybody wants to hear, I have recordings of these jetliners over our houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1543.555s">One</a>  of my neighbors is here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1545.897s">It's</a>  just crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1548.999s">And</a>  like you said, you hear it too. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1551.24s">And</a>  you can read the names of the planes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1554.823s">It's</a>  just crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1557.164s">So</a>  I'm very upset. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1559.866s">And</a>  I've been a resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1563.58s">in</a>  Medford since 1998. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1565.802s">And</a>  again, I'm used to the plane noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1568.183s">But</a>  last summer and this summer, I can't live like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1573.767s">And</a>  if I ever put my house on the market because of this noise, and a prospective buyer wanted to come in and look at it, and this noise is going over, they'd run like the wind. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1583.573s">Who</a>  would want to move here? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1585.855s">So</a>  I'm very nervous. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1591.278s">But</a>  thanks for listening.</p>

    <p>[Q7cD9OP2TNA_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1914.127s">Well,</a>  I think you all know why I'm here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1918.448s">This</a>  is just 337 people that do not want the kiosk in the square, or any part of Medford for that fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1930.05s">I</a>  see people out there every day, they don't even know what to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1933.491s">The</a>  sun's shining and they can't see, you know, what to do there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1939.252s">And</a>  they're standing out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1942.033s">It's</a>  very frustrating. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1943.878s">And</a>  of course, I'm working three days a week now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1947.939s">It's</a>  down to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1949.799s">And</a>  I don't feel like I'm going to be staying in business much longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1954.921s">And</a>  I'm not the only one. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1956.621s">Everybody</a>  I spoke to in Medford Square, they're all unhappy, very unhappy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1962.662s">So</a>  I think there should have been another way. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1967.404s">Why</a>  didn't they put cops on the beach? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1969.957s">And</a>  for the ones that are there all day and park their cars to go into Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1974.479s">Those</a>  are the ones they should have went after. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1976.92s">Now</a>  I hear this, oh, there's plenty of parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1979.481s">You</a>  know why? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1980.002s">They're</a>  boycotting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1981.983s">Everybody's</a>  boycotting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1983.563s">They</a>  don't want to pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1984.864s">It's</a>  the principle of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1986.405s">And</a>  I don't blame them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1988.806s">What</a>  have you got in Medford Square? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1990.907s">Salons</a>  and restaurants. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1994.108s">What</a>  else are they going to come for? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=1998.243s">I'm</a>  afraid Medford Square is just going to die right out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2003.924s">That's</a>  all I have to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2005.285s">But</a>  this is just 337 people, and it's still going in my shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2009.426s">OK?</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2010.126s">We</a>  want to add that to the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2012.626s">If</a>  you would give that to the city messenger, and he'll present it to the clerk to be affixed to the permanent record of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2024.629s">Did</a>  Councilor Panto want to address? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2027.751s">Councilor</a>  Penta's going to have the floor.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2032.975s">Chris,</a>  could you come to that? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2036.678s">How</a>  long have you been doing business in Medford Square?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2043.604s">And</a>  I thank you for coming forward and presenting the signatures of individuals. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2048.448s">And</a>  one of the complaints that you just talked about is something that Councilor Caraviello mentioned way back when, that nobody can read the screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2054.833s">It's</a>  the blur of the sun. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2056.708s">whatever</a>  it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2057.948s">Again,</a>  this past week, over and beyond your situation, two more people, one in particular, and I have pictures right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2066.131s">They</a>  still have kiosks in High Street in front of residential homes that were supposed to have been taken out months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2072.753s">The</a>  snow has been gone for a long period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2075.474s">They're</a>  still there, and people crazily are trying to put money into a machine in front of a two-filming house that they shouldn't have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2082.416s">And</a>  then at the same time, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2085.163s">co-worker,</a>  a co-business friend of yours in the West Method area, a girl had to get off the chair with her co-rollers in her hair to go and put money in the meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2093.488s">And</a>  she couldn't even put the money in the same meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2095.609s">She</a>  had to find another spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2096.85s">That's</a>  how crazy this whole system is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2099.131s">You</a>  know, I think it's Mr. Ruggieri. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2101.172s">He's</a>  still out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2102.313s">He's</a>  been very helpful on this, on dissecting and getting into the contract, as well as myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2107.416s">I</a>  believe there's approximately nine infractions that they have committed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2111.97s">And</a>  of course, the city has an active opponent. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2113.651s">Why,</a>  I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2114.431s">But</a>  all I can tell you is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2118.313s">As</a>  a candidate for mayor, that's going to be the first thing I am going to address. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2121.834s">Those</a>  kiosks and the damage that it's doing here to the merchants and the entire city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2127.497s">So</a>  I thank you for bringing that forward.</p>

    <p>[Q7cD9OP2TNA_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2128.577s">I</a>  think it'll be much appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2130.618s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2155.87s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Knight, can we take that as a resolution that this petition be forwarded <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2165.97s">to</a>  the Medford Traffic Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2168.771s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Knight, all those in favor?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2177.676s">What</a>  was the original motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2179.677s">There</a>  was no motion.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2180.557s">It</a>  was just discussed.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2648.035s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2650.392s">Last</a>  year, Councilor Marks brought this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2653.713s">We</a>  had a lengthy discussion over fixing the bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2656.933s">And,</a>  if I'm not mistaken, $10,000 was allocated to fix the bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2662.214s">And</a>  all we ever got was a couple of faucets changed over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2667.435s">And</a>  over the weekend, I was home doing some yard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2673.156s">I</a>  was home doing some yard work and outside and a neighbor came by and says, I went to the library last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2679.548s">with</a>  my grandson, he said the library was so bad, the bathroom was so bad, he says I wouldn't let him go to the bathroom in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2685.172s">He</a>  said, what happened to the money that you guys allocated for the repairing of it? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2690.235s">So</a>  at this point, Mr. President, I'd like to have the mayor's office provide an explanation of where the $10,000 that we authorized for the bathrooms have gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2702.223s">And</a>  this guy was a plumber, he says, if you want, he says, I'll do the work in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2707.147s">Some</a>  licensed plumber, he says, just buy the stock. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2709.548s">He</a>  said, I'm sure we can get other volunteers to do the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2712.87s">But</a>  at this point, the library is going down and down every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2721.257s">There's</a>  less funds being allocated to it, but at least we could have some clean, decent bathroom facilities for the children to use there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2730.043s">Because</a>  with the new children's librarian, you're seeing an upturn in kids going there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2735.407s">And</a>  if they've gone in the bathrooms there, they're council members ready when they're deplorable. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2741.209s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2742.29s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2743.51s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Caraviello, Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2747.232s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2749.172s">I</a>  do believe this council has on multiple occasions requested the capital needs of all the buildings that are underneath the control and jurisdiction of the city government, but also specifically the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2760.677s">And</a>  I think that this information will be very helpful, Mr. President, as we begin our <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2764.668s">preparations</a>  for the budget debates. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2766.99s">Presently,</a>  if you take a look at the Medford transcript, you'll see a great article by Mr. Ruppenthal that speaks about the funding shortages at the library and the risk that the city has been in, in losing its certification from the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2783.54s">So</a>  it looks right now that based upon the figures that I read, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2788.463s">We're</a>  about a quarter of a million dollars short in fully funding the library to make ourselves in a position where we would not require a state waiver and enable the ability to maintain certification, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2800.345s">So</a>  I think there's a lot of stuff that's going on at the library right now that really needs to be looked at or else we're going to be in a position where we might actually lose this asset. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2808.467s">The</a>  building's in rough shape. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2809.507s">I</a>  know over the winter there was a significant amount of snow buildup that resulted in <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2814.148s">some</a>  leaks and some ice dams that have damaged some books in the children's section. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2818.369s">We</a>  have the issue with the bathroom as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2821.59s">And</a>  then, you know, the discussions that we've had in the past about expanding and making a media center on the second floor of the library and building up the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2828.012s">So</a>  I think now is an important time to take a look at what's going on there in terms of the capital side of things, Mr. President, and as we begin our debates for the budget, determine whether or not the library is being funded at a level that's appropriate.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2840.575s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2841.776s">Councilor</a>  Penta.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2842.732s">One</a>  of the issues that are equally of a concerning matter is the fact that the locality of the Method Public Library is the only public library in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2852.018s">Many,</a>  many years ago, you had community-based area libraries. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2856.141s">The</a>  high school library is closed on the weekends and nighttime, so the only library that you really have left is the Method Public Library. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2862.765s">And</a>  for years, they had cut back hours on their employees, which cut back the hours of operations, if I think a few folks remember. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2869.837s">Some</a>  of the days and the hours at night and on the weekends were cut back. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2874.821s">One</a>  of the things I forgot to mention when the last lady was up here speaking, I did get a complaint from a lady who went to the Method Public Library to return a book, to run in and to run out, and she got a $25 ticket to bring her book. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2887.771s">And</a>  this takes us right back to what you had addressed a long time ago, Councilor Marks, I mean, where is this 30-minute supposedly free time you have when you pull up and getting ready to use these meters and what have you? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2899.655s">I</a>  don't know why it's taken the Traffic Commission so long, but again, it was just as bad as putting it in front of the church when they first started this thing and they had to take them out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2907.517s">Why</a>  would you put something in front of a public library, an educational building, a community building? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2912.698s">It</a>  just doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2913.798s">But</a>  on the topic itself, it just makes... Report of information, Councilor Camuso.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2920.14s">The</a>  library has a parking lot directly adjacent to the building, and I drive through that street quite frequently, and it butts it directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2929.767s">There's</a>  always available spots in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2932.408s">Just</a>  a point of information.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2934.229s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2935.29s">The</a>  fact of the matter is this lady just pulled up in the front of the house to go in and just drop off a book, and she didn't need to get a $25 ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2943.093s">And</a>  if we all remember a few months ago, when there was a funeral going on at St. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2946.415s">Joseph's</a>  Church, quite a few people got tickets there, and they had to be retaken back. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2950.497s">So</a>  again, it's just part of the whole program that really needs to be revisited, if not completely dumped.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2958.711s">Councilor,</a>  Madam Vice President.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2960.671s">Thank</a>  you, President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2962.132s">I</a>  just want to go on the record in support of Councilor Caraviello's resolve, along with your amendment, to get a list, a breakdown of what was spent on the bathrooms last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2973.594s">I</a>  think that's something we don't know, and I think that's something we all would challenge, that $10,000 was actually put into the bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2981.175s">It's</a>  upsetting because it's a public building where your children are going to <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2984.817s">you</a>  know, read and take out books from the library, they should at least be able to have a place to go to the bathroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=2991.399s">I</a>  think it correlates with a resolution you had on the agenda last week or the week before, Councilor Penta, with regards to jobs just being, $90,000 jobs being created and people getting raises of $20,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3004.924s">We</a>  heard recently of a 5% raise that, you know, took place and it just, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3014.124s">makes</a>  you stop and think, like, maybe we should take care and maintain the buildings we have before we go hire additional personnel to work in them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3024.107s">We,</a>  in the council, fight year after year, project after project for maintenance accounts, maintenance fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3030.649s">And</a>  we, Councilor Marks, you know, fought hard, you know, with our help, obviously, to get $10,000 for the bathrooms to be replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3038.591s">And</a>  we spoke about it last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3040.351s">There</a>  are people that would volunteer. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3042.64s">So</a>  I mean, it is upsetting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3043.841s">It's</a>  hard to handle how the city is operated and how the city spends money. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3050.584s">Because</a>  something like that, whether or not to do the library over, obviously, is a huge decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3056.087s">And</a>  the police department has to come into account. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3059.168s">But</a>  to get facilities and to be able to fight for $10,000 and then nothing changed, nothing happened, it's almost like, what are we doing week after week? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3068.803s">you</a>  know, voice in our opinions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3070.103s">We</a>  talked about the library bathroom six times, seven times. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3074.904s">And</a>  that's just completely unfortunate. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3076.744s">And</a>  I, you know, that's one of the many things, obviously, that upset me with regards to how money's spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3082.425s">But</a>  I would, I agree, we need, I would love to see an accounting and where the money went.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3088.446s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3090.447s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3092.027s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3092.987s">I</a>  want to thank Councilor Caraviello for offering this resolve tonight and my colleagues for their comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3099.884s">You</a>  know, the article I read in the paper, you know, mentioned the library director, Brian Boutelier, and I remember the last several budgets when we sat in, like we do with all the department heads, and when we asked the question of the director of the library, what are your needs for the library, he said, at this time, I don't have any. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3124.761s">pointed</a>  the question about the restrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3127.883s">And</a>  I likened them to prison bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3132.746s">And</a>  he said he doesn't see anything wrong with the bathrooms at the public library. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3137.449s">And</a>  I think that's part of the problem we're seeing is the attitude, to be quite honest with you, from the director himself on the condition of the building and the inability to stand up on behalf of the library, which is his job. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3154.989s">fight</a>  for what's needed within that library. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3157.391s">We</a>  were told last week they're down a children's position. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3160.655s">We</a>  were told they're down a reference librarian. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3163.257s">Councilor</a>  Knight just mentioned about the fact that we may lose certification. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3167.802s">We're</a>  about a quarter of a million dollars away from certification. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3171.866s">The</a>  last, the Mass Board of Library Commissioners, Mr. President, without their certification, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3178.902s">We</a>  could lose network subscriptions, database, and interlibrary loans. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3185.549s">We</a>  could lose the ability for Method residents to use their Minuteman card and go to any other library in the Minuteman network. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3194.919s">I</a>  hear a lot of people say, well, I go to Lexington or I go to Arlington. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3198.562s">And</a>  the fact that we may be on an island <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3201.512s">because</a>  we refuse to put in the necessary funds to fund our library. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3208.377s">I</a>  would say you go to that library at any given time, Mr. President, you'll see people in all the different sections. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3214.522s">The</a>  library is highly utilized. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3217.384s">And</a>  even based on the current offerings it has, it's still an attraction in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3223.348s">And</a>  yes, things are changing and things are going more electronic and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3227.291s">I</a>  understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3228.907s">There's</a>  ways, like the town of Watertown, who just built a library a few years ago, state of the art library, is attracting people back to the library, different offerings back in the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3240.934s">We</a>  have a community room in the library, in my opinion, that's underutilized and could be a much larger asset. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3248.618s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello mentioned on many occasions about adding a second floor onto the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3253.453s">and</a>  creating some type of community room or function room up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3258.738s">And,</a>  you know, there's a host of things we can do with this library, but one thing we can no longer do is to underfund the library, keep on getting a waiver from the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3270.568s">Now,</a>  from what I was told by a state representative, that waiver is supposed to be a one-time thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3276.153s">Okay,</a>  Method, you couldn't reach the funding this year for whatever circumstance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3280.436s">Here's</a>  a waiver. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3281.715s">We'll</a>  keep you in the network. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3284.136s">We'll</a>  keep the funding coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3285.597s">But</a>  here's your waiver." <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3286.758s">But</a>  to get a waiver year after year after year is an injustice, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3292.1s">And</a>  the state legislature should have never allowed that within their legislation, to allow a community to use that as a crutch to say, you know what, we're no longer going to fund our library and we don't care because we got a waiver from the state saying we can do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3308.329s">That</a>  wasn't the intent of the legislature. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3311.363s">the</a>  legislation that was filed by the legislature. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3314.045s">And</a>  Method, from what I read in the article, was one of just a few communities that has received a waiver, or multiple waivers, in the last several years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3325.654s">So,</a>  you know, we're falling short of the mark here, and it's quite disturbing, because I wish I could tell residents, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3333.359s">We're</a>  not putting the money into the library, but we're putting it into our police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3337.757s">That's</a>  not the case, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3339.639s">We're</a>  not putting the money into the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3341.281s">We're</a>  putting it into City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3342.823s">Go</a>  into any one of these restrooms up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3344.765s">They're</a>  in deplorable condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3346.327s">There's</a>  yellow crime tape around the urinals that you can't use. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3350.492s">The</a>  sinks don't work, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3352.653s">It's</a>  a disgrace. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3354.133s">The</a>  hand sanitizers, the minute they put the hand sanitizer dispensers around the building, within three weeks, they were gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3361.355s">There</a>  was nothing left in them, and they haven't been replaced, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3365.577s">It's</a>  just, you know, it's amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3367.897s">So,</a>  I wish I could tell people we're taking our money and utilizing it somewhere else, but that's not the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3374.619s">And</a>  the taxes, as people mentioned, keep on going up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3377.72s">The</a>  buildings, the infrastructure is crumbling, and we really have very little to show. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3382.791s">And</a>  I agree with Councilor Caraviello that, you know, I think we did receive an itemized listing a while back. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3394.316s">Because</a>  what originally happened was this whole council voted unanimously for $10,000 in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3399.519s">And</a>  the administration was kind enough to put it in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3402.68s">The</a>  air conditioning went within the public library. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3406.722s">And</a>  they used the $10,000 towards the air conditioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3410.168s">Now,</a>  I'm not going to dispute that if they thought that was more of a priority than fixing the restrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3415.451s">They</a>  did find more funding in the budget to do the restrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3419.673s">Now,</a>  Mr. President, I'm not going to want to speak out, but let me tell you, Mr. President, I don't know if anyone watched the movie, The Jerk, with Steve Mott. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3431.759s">It's</a>  a movie from years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3433.659s">He</a>  ran into millions of dollars, the jerk, and he lived in a little shack. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3439.112s">And</a>  with that millions of dollars, you know what he did? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3441.474s">He</a>  built a bigger shack. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3444.117s">And</a>  that's what we did in the library bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3447.881s">We</a>  went from a deplorable bathroom with deplorable tiles and fixtures and everything else, to now a deplorable bathroom with a new sink, the same old tiles, dirty tiles, the same old crummy doors. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3462.692s">The</a>  same old prison style, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3465.993s">And</a>  that's going to be the showcase. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3467.473s">When</a>  people from other communities come to our library, they walk in the restroom, they must be saying, where am I? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3473.514s">My</a>  seat adjunction, where am I? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3477.655s">What's</a>  going on, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3480.876s">You</a>  know, I just don't know what's happening, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3484.657s">But</a>  again, in this year's budget, I hope we all sit down and we have our deliberations. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3489.385s">And</a>  when the director comes before us and say, you know what, I'm fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3493.246s">Everything's</a>  running fine in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3494.986s">I</a>  have half the staff, but you know, we make ends meet. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3498.607s">My</a>  budget for maintenance has gone down, but we make ends meet. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3502.748s">And</a>  we should all in one voice say, Mr. Boutelier, you're not making ends meet. <a

href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3511.55s">Open</a>  your eyes.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3513.67s">If</a>  I could just from the chair, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3516.554s">In</a>  defense of someone who's not here to speak for himself, my experience with the librarian is that he's very much concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3523.397s">Medford's</a>  at a crossroads now that we have the opportunity to elect new leadership, and we'll do that, and I think we'll see some adjustments.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3531.58s">Mr.</a>  President, just if I could, a department head is not here just to collect a $110,000 salary. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3538.464s">A</a>  department head is there to do the people's business and to make sure whatever they're in charge of is kept up, Mr. President, and that they're the biggest advocate, the biggest advocate, and not playing second fiddle, saying, well, politically, I don't want to say anything because I don't want to jeopardize my job. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3556.741s">That</a>  is not what a department head should be, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3561.305s">And</a>  I don't think I'm throwing anyone under the bus, Mr. President, because I feel strongly <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3565.208s">meeting</a>  with this particular department head over the last several years and hearing his answers year after year after year to our questions, that everything is fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3574.01s">So</a>  I, I, I, I don't feel like I'm speaking out of turn here and I look forward to this budget session, Mr. President, and maybe we'll get a different outcome from the department head.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3584.292s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3584.612s">Counsel</a>  Max. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3585.292s">Councilor</a>  Carfiello. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3586.332s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3587.533s">Uh,</a>  you know, if you go on the state website, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3590.955s">There's</a>  been a grant system there for rebuilding of the libraries and renovating the libraries for the last two to three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3597.599s">And</a>  I called up and asked, and we've never applied for the funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3601.541s">So</a>  there was funds out there available, but if you don't ask, you can never get them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3607.825s">We</a>  finally hired a top flight children's librarian. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3613.67s">And</a>  the kids are assigned to go back there, and we have nothing to offer them when they go back there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3620.674s">We</a>  need to update that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3622.855s">I</a>  mean, again, even some minor improvements would be a help there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3627.418s">You</a>  know, on the last two budgets, I asked the librarian, I says, you know, where do you see the library in five years? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3634.882s">And</a>  didn't get an answer on either time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3639.286s">No,</a>  there's no five-year plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3640.706s">That's</a>  why we're not getting any money, because we don't have a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3644.888s">People</a>  aren't going to just throw money at you anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3646.828s">Those</a>  days are over. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3648.589s">You</a>  have to get out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3649.389s">You've</a>  got to do some work. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3650.209s">You've</a>  got to be creative. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3651.33s">You've</a>  got to go out there and find your money. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3653.471s">And</a>  there's been money out there available. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3655.791s">It's</a>  kind of dried up now, but you let it sit there for three or four years, and you never went after it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3661.193s">So</a>  again, I agree with Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3663.754s">This</a>  year, when the budget time comes, and he says everything is hunky-dory. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3668.669s">I</a>  think we all better sit there and question him a lot harder than we did last time.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3673.371s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3673.731s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Caraviello as amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3677.752s">Sir,</a>  please state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3680.053s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3680.913s">Anthony</a>  D'Antonio, 12 Yale street Medford through the chair for Councilor Caraviello, uh, February 11th, 2014, we issued a check for $9,694 for fixtures. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3693.057s">And</a>  who do we buy these from Liberace? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3694.978s">I</a>  mean, really? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3696.31s">What</a>  do we have? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3698.051s">It's</a>  a disgrace. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3698.811s">I</a>  agree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3699.491s">I</a>  was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3700.011s">I</a>  saw it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3701.052s">The</a>  library is a disgrace. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3704.593s">I</a>  have a suggestion, though, because not all is lost. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3708.734s">In</a>  the budget, when you go and look at the budget this year, we have two assistant superintendents making $112,000 each. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3718.018s">I</a>  would like to see it just justify one assistant superintendent, let alone two. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3722.379s">Let's</a>  take that money and reallocate it somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3725.832s">We've</a>  got to get some people in there that know what to do with the numbers, because this city needs to get back up on top. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3732.857s">Tired</a>  of watching it go one rung below, another rung, another rung. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3736.14s">So</a>  do the best you can on that, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3737.641s">I</a>  appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3738.341s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3739.903s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3740.903s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Caraviello, as amended, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3744.466s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3746.267s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3747.008s">Motion</a>  carries. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3748.849s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3749.93s">When</a>  I made my public service announcement earlier in the meeting, I may have misspoken. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3755.42s">So</a>  on Friday, May 29th at 9 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3758.181s">at</a>  the Immaculate Conception Church, the Medford Police Memorial Mass will be offered. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3763.862s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3764.282s">15-494</a>  offered by Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3769.763s">Be</a>  it resolved that the lack of important information not provided to this council regarding the Craddock Bridge be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3778.566s">Councilor</a>  Penta.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3779.586s">Mr.</a>  President, but more importantly, anybody who might be watching and Medford Square business folks, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3785.254s">The</a>  situation regarding the Karatek Bridge is just an ongoing tale. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3789.396s">So</a>  I think it's time to maybe have a little bit of a history lesson here as it relates to how did we get to the position we're in right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3797.36s">We</a>  can go back to 2002, 02-2002-526, offered by Council Longo. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3803.423s">Be</a>  it resolved that the Karatek Bridge be discussed in regards to public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3808.545s">And</a>  there was a whole host of amendments as it related to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3810.826s">Now</a>  that was in 2002, 13 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3814.935s">First</a>  response from the state came back in 2006. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3817.116s">They</a>  first sent a note back that basically says that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts will be taking a look and to review it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3827.763s">Then</a>  we go to 2011. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3829.364s">From</a>  2006 to 2011, there was absolutely nothing that took place that revolved around that particular bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3836.628s">At</a>  that point in time in 2011, they said the cost of the bridge was going to be $2.5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3840.671s">Then</a>  in August of 2012, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3845.144s">it</a>  jumped to $8.5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3846.925s">And</a>  then in April of 2013, it jumped up to $12.7 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3853.147s">And</a>  at that meeting on April 13, on April, excuse me, of 2013, I had asked the question as it relates to mitigation for our downtown Medford business folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3864.31s">The</a>  council voted seven to nothing on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3866.291s">As</a>  a matter of fact, we got a letter of support from the Medford Chamber of Commerce on that particular issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3871.692s">Sent</a>  the letter to the mayor and to the state, and to this date, still, absolutely nothing has come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3877.095s">From</a>  April, we sent it again in May of 2013. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3881.077s">June</a>  of 2013, the cost then went down to $10.7 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3888.28s">And</a>  now, again, on February of 2014, the question of mitigation came up, it was presented, and we still have no answer to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3896.344s">All</a>  we know right now that we're getting a bridge <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3899.135s">that</a>  supposedly are going to be starting at this point in time, sometime this summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3905.037s">And</a>  what doesn't make sense now, they're saying that on November 4th of 2018, the bridge will be completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3914.121s">But</a>  during the summer of 2018, the bridge will be open for use. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3921.023s">So</a>  how can you have something not completed and open for use or be completed in November of 2018? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3929.187s">And</a>  that cost now is projected at $10.78 million for this particular bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3939.35s">We've</a>  seen all kinds of correspondence from representatives in our city who are saying this is a wonderful thing, dating back to 2006, to 2012, to 2013. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3952.654s">We've</a>  received press releases from the mayor, from the senator in this community, that this bridge is such a wonderful thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3958.878s">You</a>  know, they built the tunnel from France to England, which was, I believe, 21 miles in less than nine years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3966.244s">And</a>  we have a bridge here starting in 2015 to be included by 2018, that's three years, to go 121 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3977.712s">Think</a>  about it, 121 feet when you built the tunnel, which was 21 miles, and it was underwater. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3984.457s">This</a>  whole thing, as far as I'm concerned, is the biggest slap in the face <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3988.356s">to</a>  the Medford business community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3990.197s">And</a>  the sad part about it, one of the gentlemen who's in charge of this project lives in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=3994.958s">Now,</a>  Councilor Dello Russo, I'm calling you on the carpet tonight because you indicated that you'd never received the letter dated February 24th, for which your name is on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4004.582s">Every</a>  single one of our reps, our senators, our state, Paul Geer, Cassandra upstairs in the engineer's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4013.225s">And</a>  I accepted you for your comment saying that you couldn't find it in your file. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4019.203s">But</a>  it was convenient for you last week to get Eversource here just like that, when the conditions of the streets might be taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4026.785s">But</a>  at the same time, this council has been asking, asking for you to go forward and call for this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4034.428s">And</a>  there is no meeting here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4036.248s">But</a>  there are public notices out there, and there are stanchions out there indicating that the bridge is going to start this summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4043.253s">So</a>  what clout you have, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4045.574s">What</a>  clout this city has, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4048.075s">But</a>  the more important part of where the clout all lies is this city council should be holding somebody to be accountable for the mitigation process that needs to take place on this, because businesses are going to be hurt, and some people might even go out of business. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4063.02s">It's</a>  absolutely unfair that this project is going to start in the summer of 2015 and not be completed until November of 2018.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4074.47s">On</a>  my first point is you had Eversource here as a result of Councilor Marks bringing the issue forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4083.753s">So</a>  I applaud you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4086.835s">And</a>  my second point of information is we did have representatives from the bridge here about a year ago, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4094.257s">Twice</a>  in six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4096.778s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4097.418s">And</a>  at that point they stated that there won't be any mitigation to businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4104.728s">even</a>  though this council did ask for it, they clearly stated that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4108.449s">So,</a>  I don't want businesses to think otherwise.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4111.25s">With</a>  all due respect to my council colleague, that may be your interpretation, but nothing was ever definitively signed or put in writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4118.071s">This</a>  council asked to have that put in the RFP that went out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4121.392s">And</a>  there are four people, there are four components to the people who are bidding on that bridge, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4125.433s">This</a>  council asked that they come here and they apprise the city, the council, and the business community, and the Office of Community Development as it relates to the progress of that bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4134.898s">and</a>  they never did it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4136.079s">The</a>  only meeting that they ever had was, I believe, some three weeks ago at 10 o'clock on a Wednesday morning, for which certain councils couldn't go, a lot of people couldn't go, and it was just their staff meeting, if you want to come and see what it's all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4148.793s">And</a>  then they send you a press release, for which is put in the paper, that basically tells you that this is not going to be completed until 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4156.822s">So</a>  if you forget all the gibberish that gets around to 2018, and then they acknowledge that the footings of the bridge, which have been there for 100 plus years, all they're going to do is reshore them up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4166.49s">That</a>  bridge is not sunk at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4168.632s">And</a>  what they think they're building, the Taj Mahal, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4171.835s">They</a>  don't need to build the Longfellow Bridge like they're building in Washington. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4175.578s">This</a>  is a very simple bridge of 121 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4179.442s">Sure,</a>  you want to make it adaptable for people, sidewalks and bikes, go right ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4183.667s">But</a>  with the art of technology that's out there today, and for them to tell you it's going to take you a well over a year just to figure out what's underneath the bridge and move the lines and this and that, that is absolutely absurd. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4194.45s">Absolutely</a>  absurd. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4195.49s">It's</a>  probably the biggest snow job that this council and this city has gotten from the State Department of Public Transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4202.452s">And</a>  we haven't even gotten to the issue of the bus routes and the changing of the bus routes and what's going to happen after that and once this bridge goes into construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4210.597s">Mr.</a>  President, I'm asking once again, I'm asking you to call the Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4214.178s">Department</a>  of Transportation, have them come before this council, and have them explain if what Councilor Camuso was saying is correct, that they are not going to give us mitigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4222.7s">Point</a>  of information? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4224.261s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Camuso.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4227.882s">That</a>  was the Department of Transportation representatives that were here meeting with this city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4233.783s">Clearly</a>  stated that the state does not pay mitigation on projects, but what they do do <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4240.88s">is</a>  pay for any damages to any public or private entities that are damaged as a result. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4248.125s">That's</a>  a big difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4249.406s">Mitigation</a>  and physical damage.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4252.508s">Well,</a>  I'm going to respectfully disagree with my colleague because state agencies and state departments do pay mitigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4257.611s">And</a>  if they're asked to do it, they do do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4259.713s">The</a>  biggest one out there right now is the MWRA. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4262.014s">They'll</a>  give you mitigation before they even start a project because they have to realize the length and the strength of their pipes.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4269.376s">We</a>  can throw out the red herring, say an MWRA or any other agency he wants to. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4274.399s">They</a>  are not a state agency. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4277.08s">The</a>  MWRA is a separate and distinct authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4280.402s">It's</a>  an authority like Massport. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4281.803s">It's</a>  an authority like the MBTA. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4283.844s">Their</a>  rules, their laws are different. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4286.838s">The</a>  Department of Transportation clearly stated this to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4290.0s">They</a>  said it right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4290.86s">If</a>  we have to go back, rewind the tape, maybe the council forgot what they said. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4294.542s">I'm</a>  not responsible for what he remembers, but I'm responsible for what happened here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4298.284s">And</a>  that is clearly what was said. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4299.884s">The</a>  state does not pay mitigation on public projects.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4304.267s">Well,</a>  I'm responsible for what I know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4305.707s">And</a>  what I know is this, that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts does and can, if the city of Medford is going to be impacted to such a degree and businesses are going to be displaced for a period of time such as that, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4315.791s">When</a>  you have your own Chamber of Commerce, and when you have an entire city council, and when you've been talking about this since 2013, and went out since 2015, and there is nothing, no acknowledgement, no public hearing, no public meeting, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4328.536s">It's</a>  a disgrace. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4329.556s">And</a>  if you think they're doing a good job by taking this bridge over and cutting down the amount of time that it's going to take, or not to take, it's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4337.138s">It's</a>  not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4337.998s">This</a>  is not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4339.198s">This</a>  does not speak well for a governmental project and a governmental agency. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4343.359s">And</a>  more importantly, how can you go and start with $2 million, go as high as $12 million, bring it back to $10 million? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4351.04s">They</a>  can't even figure out what the actual cost is going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4353.78s">And</a>  the total disruption is going to be when they put that ramp in Medford Square, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4357.672s">and</a>  shutting off one of the ramps coming off Route 93, there's going to be a complete fiasco. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4363.016s">We</a>  still haven't seen the final product. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4365.378s">It</a>  still hasn't been presented to the business people, the Chamber of Commerce, or this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4371.463s">And</a>  that, to me, is what this whole system, this whole project is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4376.407s">Absolutely</a>  no transparency at all.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4380.511s">Mr.</a>  President, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4382.332s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4383.822s">to</a>  say that there was no public meetings, it's fiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4386.845s">It's</a>  fiction, once again. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4388.246s">We</a>  had a meeting here with the representatives from the Massachusetts Department of Transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4394.691s">One</a>  of them's name was Donald Daly, and I don't remember the other gentleman's name. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4400.036s">What</a>  was it? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4400.596s">Paul</a>  King. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4401.297s">Paul</a>  King. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4402.197s">They</a>  were here at a 7 PM meeting of the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4405.56s">Twice.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4406.261s">Twice.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4407.162s">Twice.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4407.742s">So</a>  to sit here and say that there hasn't been public</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4412.88s">The</a>  meeting took place on the 18th of July, 2013, and it took place at the Century Bank and Trust on Mystic Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4421.442s">The</a>  time that came over here, his name was Billy something. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4424.003s">He</a>  appeared here from Medford and his other person. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4427.924s">That's</a>  what took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4429.164s">And</a>  that meeting, we were told, as a matter of fact, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4432.06s">I</a>  have Mr. Davey's private personal number because at that particular night, in that particular meeting, they were trying to shut me off. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4438.803s">I'm</a>  asking him a very important question as to why this meeting was not being held here in Medford and where is the mitigation as it relates to the concern that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4447.027s">If</a>  you're not going to give us mitigation, what are you going to give for the business community? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4450.689s">Don't</a>  tell me you're going to pay for the disruption or the destruction to their product. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4454.143s">Of</a>  course they would have to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4455.304s">That's</a>  common sense tells you that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4456.985s">But</a>  don't come in here and do a project and totally disrupt the entire community, the downtown area. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4461.568s">You</a>  have bus routes, you can have people completely confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4464.63s">Can</a>  anyone in this council turn around and explain what's going to go on? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4467.932s">Can</a>  you tell me where the bus routes are going to go? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4469.413s">Pardon</a>  me?</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4470.674s">Yes,</a>  yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4472.055s">The</a>  bus routes are going to go, the main bus route. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4476.177s">I</a>  don't know if the councillor took the time to reach out to the correct officials as I did, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4480.653s">but</a>  the bus route is going to be moved.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4481.974s">Point</a>  of clarification, point of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4483.836s">He</a>  wants to make representative to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4485.437s">My</a>  point is they belong before the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4487.899s">I</a>  don't want to do something and the public belongs to hear what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4491.201s">And</a>  that's what the council called for. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4492.643s">If</a>  he wants to go on his own, good luck to him. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4494.484s">I</a>  want him to come before here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4495.945s">This</a>  is a city of Medford project.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4499.122s">As</a>  I stated, if the councillor doesn't want to go over and above, as I have over my 16 years of public service, reaching out to the particular people that can make, rather than yelling and screaming in hot air, can actually make the bus stop moved, they are moving it across the river over near the bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4516.685s">And</a>  hopefully it will be a permanent home even after the construction project with a nice greenery and maybe a bus shelter that Councilor Marks brought up before. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4525.266s">So</a>  I am doing some talks with the appropriate people. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4529.114s">That's</a>  number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4530.035s">Number</a>  two, I'm going to revert to a conversation I had with the councillor just a week ago, who was adamant about a former member of this council not bringing up the beer and wine.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4540.581s">Point</a>  of information, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4542.882s">It's</a>  got absolutely nothing to do with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4544.483s">He's</a>  talking about apples and oranges. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4545.944s">It's</a>  got nothing to do with this particular issue.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4547.725s">It's</a>  a pattern of your fictitious mind.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4549.886s">It's</a>  your fictitious mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4551.667s">This</a>  has nothing to do with this issue.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4554.971s">There's</a>  nothing to do with the issue.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4556.733s">You</a>  want to shoot for her, do it in the public.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4560.076s">As</a>  I started to say, Mr. President, earlier in his dissertation this evening, he said there was no public meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4565.923s">In</a>  fact, there were two public meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4568.406s">And</a>  the public meetings were in 2013. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4569.987s">This</a>  is 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4572.47s">and</a>  we had one here at the Medford City Council, not in 2013, I will get you the exact date, but it was right here, the gentlemen were here, it was the first meeting, the first item agenda, I believe, and it was a very, very good meeting, and they emphatically stated, I mean, if you wanna make up the rules as you go along, like you've done a long time.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4591.421s">It's</a>  right here, Councilor, and it's right here.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4593.623s">As</a>  I said, Mr. President, if he wants to let people believe there's mitigation available and set people up for failure, that's his responsibility.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4600.827s">Point</a>  of information, Vice President Lundell-Curran.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4604.128s">I</a>  just, I believe one councilor's talking about a public meeting and one councilor's talking about a public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4610.831s">There</a>  was plenty of meetings, but I don't believe the state has had any public hearings. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4616.994s">They</a>  haven't declared any meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4618.874s">They</a>  haven't notified neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4620.275s">They</a>  haven't notified businesses of a meeting where citizens and business owners can give their... There was one here today in this building.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4625.737s">There</a>  was one today that he didn't go to.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4627.898s">Oh,</a>  I didn't know about that one.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4629.379s">But,</a>  I mean...</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4630.924s">A</a>  year ago, we had public hearings before the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4634.906s">I</a>  never have known about one where the community has been notified to give their input of this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4640.49s">I</a>  mean, because I agree, three years is going to detrimentally affect our Medford Square businesses to the point where maybe there'll be no mitigation, but there'll be claims in court against the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4653.497s">I</a>  mean, and that's a given if you see a business go out <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4658.6s">go</a>  out of business and due to loss of income from, you know, the project that's going to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4663.161s">So,</a>  um, I think both Councilors are making their points and have a right in their own different ways.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4670.303s">Thank</a>  you for your point of information.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4671.984s">So</a>  Mr. President, if I just can finish council, and I'll wrap it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4675.765s">I</a>  just, um, in council Lungo-Koehn is a hundred percent correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4679.706s">There</a>  can be lawsuits and there probably will be lawsuits, but the fact of the matter is the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on this particular matter is the department of transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4687.487s">does</a>  not pay mitigation for two businesses as a result of public works projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4695.472s">If</a>  that was the case when they did the central artery and took down all the green space in there and did the Rose Kennedy Garden, the disruption, Mr. President, the disruption is lousy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4708.62s">And</a>  I understand that completely, completely.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4716.537s">Councilor</a>  Camuso just referred to the Rose Kennedy Garden. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4718.798s">The</a>  Rose Kennedy Garden was an afterthought. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4720.839s">It</a>  was going to be a greenway. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4722.54s">The</a>  Rose Kennedy Garden came in after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4724.621s">That</a>  was part of the mitigation and the rehabilitation because of the damage and the construction that took place in the artery.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4732.645s">And</a>  Mr. President, precisely, it was a public works mitigation that went to the city of Boston, not to the businesses that were directly affected in that area, like Faneuil Hall Marketplace and <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4747.461s">Well,</a>  businesses property get taken care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4750.667s">But</a>  like I said, the city, I'm sorry, the state, they said that at this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4756.488s">This</a>  isn't fiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4757.548s">This</a>  is factual, what the state said to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4760.569s">Now</a>  if the law changes, I hope it changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4763.209s">I</a>  hope it changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4764.309s">But</a>  like I said, I think our biggest thing right now is doing everything in our power to help the businesses, as I've been doing with other members of this council, talking to the MBTA about moving a bus stop that is gonna be detrimental to the passengers, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4778.972s">in</a>  the current state of placement of it, as well as for the businesses that are already going to be dealing with. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4786.215s">So</a>  let's work on the stuff that we do have some input and control over. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4790.637s">The</a>  DOT is overseeing this project, the Department of Transportation, and City Clerk Finn, at what point have they notified you about the public hearings coming up regarding posting it on the board and everything, or not yet? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4807.775s">Can</a>  you turn him on?</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4808.415s">What</a>  they tend to do is either fax over a notice or email a notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4812.977s">So</a>  it's sporadic the way some of these notices come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4816.739s">So</a>  I'm not quite sure on the one today. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4819.0s">I</a>  haven't checked the postings.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4820.421s">Because</a>  this Saturday, too, the bid went out for the Crystal Campbell Peace Garden. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4824.803s">The</a>  bid went out this Saturday, two days ago.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4827.724s">So</a>  the bids are posted mostly at, when you have bids, that's posted at procurement. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4833.667s">That's</a>  a big wall, posting things.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4835.267s">And</a>  the DOT does notify? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4837.792s">city</a>  though where it is in the city correct normally okay so so like I said it just public meetings are meetings to get the information public hearings are more legality it's a legality in certain instances you need a public hearing correct me if I'm wrong clerk Finn is that correct public hearing is a legality if it calls for you if it calls for you but they're not gonna have public hearings unless it calls for it correct <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4864.03s">I</a>  mean, there's a difference between public hearing and public meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4865.992s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4867.453s">And</a>  given the public hearings that may be called for this might be because of the river underneath it and the river being affected by it and that environmental public hearing, things of that nature.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4880.385s">Is</a>  that correct?</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4881.086s">Conservation</a>  things. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4882.127s">But</a>  typically there's not public hearings for doing a bridge over within a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4887.472s">There</a>  doesn't need to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4888.837s">because</a>  it doesn't need to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4889.838s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4890.178s">I</a>  just, I think that's important to, um, cause Councilor Lungo-Koehn brought up a very valid point. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4895.381s">But,</a>  uh, if there is going to be public hearings, number one, they will hold them at an open, open place where people can participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4903.926s">It</a>  will be duly advertised. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4905.688s">Uh,</a>  and it also will be on the bulletin boards here at city hall, but unless it calls for it, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4910.42s">unless</a>  it calls for it for a specific legality, and that's because maybe they're building so close to the water and this and that, but they just don't have public hearings, as you said, Mr. Clerk, for the sake of just having public hearings. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4925.686s">There's</a>  a legal authority behind a public hearing and not so much a public meeting.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4933.75s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4936.05s">Councilor</a>  Knight has the floor next. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4937.591s">You</a>  have two points of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4939.012s">Councilor</a>  Panto.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4940.767s">First</a>  of all, as it relates to the bus stop, whether it's being moved over the bridge or, as some of us were led to believe, it might be moved to Medford Square, we were supposed to be getting a report back from the T that would indicate where that bus stop was going to be moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4957.939s">That's</a>  number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4958.62s">The</a>  other gentleman who came here that night, his name was Paul King, and he was the project manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4963.964s">He</a>  also indicated, for which they have now changed their times from the days and the night shifts as to when <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4970.693s">working</a>  hours are going to take place, which is a change from what was written on January 21st, 2015, as compared to the most recent one on May 20th of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4983.196s">And</a>  again, once again, none of the businesses are aware of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4986.397s">So</a>  there is a, and the request by the council was to have them here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4990.638s">You</a>  know, I'm not going to get hung up on the legality of a hearing or a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4995.02s">It's</a>  a request. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=4996.78s">And</a>  if the request to have a state agency or somebody come here, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5000.42s">to</a>  explain what their project is about, then they should honor the request, either in writing or what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5006.782s">You</a>  said, Councilor Dello Russo, when I gave you the letter that you said you couldn't find and you never got, you went to the city clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5013.005s">The</a>  city clerk supposedly called them up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5016.146s">Never</a>  got a response, did you, Mr. Clerk? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5018.447s">So</a>  that's a great way to have, and he called not once, but he called twice. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5021.988s">It's</a>  a great way for a state agency to act on behalf of a community that has a major project going through it, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5028.45s">And</a>  we're worried about allegedly a legality from a hearing to a request to be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5034.018s">That's</a>  absolutely nonsense. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5036.281s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5038.645s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5042.132s">I</a>  have concerns about the bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5043.534s">I've</a>  raised them last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5044.675s">I</a>  had a resolution asking the harbormaster to meet with the project manager to determine what restrictions were going to be on the roadway for boaters up river. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5052.921s">I</a>  think that we've all scratched our heads and wondered what's going to happen with the buses. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5057.125s">We've</a>  all scratched our heads and wondered how this off-ramp is going to work, where cars can take lefts and rights around the backside of Medford Auto to get through Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5065.679s">With</a>  that being said, Mr. President, you know, I wholeheartedly feel as though another meeting would be beneficial to get some of our questions answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5072.685s">However,</a>  it appears to me that the DOT is not willing to have this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5076.328s">So</a>  with that being said, I'm wondering if it would be a beneficial exercise for us to maybe put some questions in writing as to what we want answered and send them over to the project manager and have the project manager get back to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5085.814s">If,</a>  in fact, the project manager doesn't get back to us in a timely fashion, then we can take action. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5089.815s">But</a>  at this point in time, Mr. President, let's try to get the questions answered so that we can provide the information to those people that are going to be most affected by it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5097.778s">And</a>  we can go from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5098.598s">But</a>  I think what we really need to focus on is solutions, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5101.879s">And,</a>  you know, we need to focus on how we're going to help these businesses through this tough time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5106.08s">It's</a>  going to be three years of construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5107.821s">How</a>  we're going to improve traffic flow during this three-year period of time as construction is going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5114.62s">figure</a>  out what best practices work so that when we have another construction project at this scale, we're prepared to deal with it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5121.042s">So,</a>  you know, I'd like to see maybe a listing of the questions that we have that we need answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5126.784s">And</a>  if we can get those together maybe as a group in committee of the whole and then vote on it to come out of the committee and then vote on that to have those questions sent to the DOT for an answer, I think that we might be on the right track, Mr. President, to actually getting solutions.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5148.512s">Do</a>  we have a motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5155.155s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Camuso that the representatives of the project present themselves before the City Council for a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5162.259s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5165.961s">Councilor</a>  Marks?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5168.122s">I</a>  should mention a timeframe on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5174.267s">maybe</a>  before the summer session, but I agree with the comments that were made. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5178.289s">I</a>  think we all agree that a meeting or a public hearing, whatever it may be, is necessary and would be beneficial. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5185.673s">I</a>  know what Councilor Knight's going after, but I think you also need, you know, I may have a bunch of questions, but there may be a hundred residents that have different questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5193.693s">So</a>  I think a hearing or a meeting is imperative. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5196.735s">I</a>  think we need to hear from the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5199.818s">And</a>  from what I remember with the FAST-14 project, which the state was involved with, you're right, the state didn't give us any mitigation, but J.F. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5208.445s">White</a>  most certainly gave us mitigation money. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5211.087s">So</a>  whoever the contractor is, is the one that doles out the mitigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5215.33s">And</a>  that's why we've asked, even with Eversource, we've asked the administration to use some leverage in order to get some mitigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5223.015s">for</a>  tearing up all our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5224.735s">And</a>  we should be asking the same, whoever the contractor is of this credit bridge, for mitigation on what's going to take place, the impact of the business owners, the impact of the drive time in the morning, the commute. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5242.078s">There's</a>  a host of impacts that are going to take place, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5245.259s">So,</a>  you know, I hope that they don't turn a cheek at us, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5251.38s">And</a>  if I'm not mistaken, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5252.904s">Myself,</a>  Councilor Penta, I think Councilor Caraviello, we attended a meeting that was had right across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5260.23s">I</a>  don't know if it was about a year ago, I think Councilor Lungo was there too, early in the morning with the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5267.497s">And</a>  our community development director, Lauren DiLorenzo, I'll never forget this, she stood up and pointed at the developer, I mean the state, and said, we have been left out of this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5278.726s">You</a>  have not given us ample opportunity to speak on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5281.888s">And</a>  that's coming from our own director of office of community development. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5285.531s">So</a>  you can imagine when a member of the council gets up and says, we'd like to get more information on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5290.214s">If</a>  our own community development office can't get it, then how are we as council supposed to get this on behalf of the residents of this community? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5297.13s">And</a>  that spoke volumes that morning, Mr. President, when she spoke up, saying that they haven't been involved in the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5303.553s">Now,</a>  that was some time back. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5304.753s">I'm</a>  not sure if it's changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5306.314s">But</a>  I can only tell you, the only information I get is through just piecemeal and whatever I happen to read in the newspaper, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5314.097s">So,</a>  that's a sad commentary.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5316.118s">The</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5316.979s">It</a>  is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5317.279s">It</a>  is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5317.659s">Councilor</a>  Knight has the floor, and then Councilor Camuso.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5320.44s">Mr.</a>  President, I know that mitigation is going to be very important to the businesses down in the Medford Square area, and whether or not we're able to <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5327.768s">Triumph,</a>  that is a whole other question, but I think that there are some things that we can control here at the local level in terms of mitigation, and maybe that's something that we need to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5335.696s">But</a>  one of the first things that pops to mind is the biggest complaint that we're hearing out there right now from shop owners is the kiosks in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5343.043s">So</a>  maybe if the state's not willing to help us out with mitigation, then maybe we can go a step further and we as a city can help mitigate by maybe <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5350.207s">changing</a>  the hours of operation of the kiosk. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5351.948s">So</a>  closing the kiosk down for certain days or certain periods of time in that business district while construction is going on to provide some relief to the business owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5359.933s">I</a>  think that the construction alone, well, the traffic patents alone right now in Medford square scare people away. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5364.776s">With</a>  the construction coming in the kiosk, I think this is really going to have a detrimental effect, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5369.499s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5370.279s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5372.18s">Councilor</a>  Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5373.561s">Yes,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5374.261s">And</a>  the city administration up to this point, this has been front and center. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5379.458s">This</a>  afternoon, I believe 1 or 1.30, there was a meeting with all the department heads, the Department of Transportation, the Chamber of Commerce, and so everyone was at the table, and maybe they're working out specifics right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5394.07s">and</a>  then they'll be bringing it forward at another level. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5397.832s">I</a>  mean, at another meeting, I do not know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5400.533s">But</a>  there is ongoing dialogue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5403.114s">And</a>  as Councilor Knight said, there may be something we can do internally, whether it's a tax break. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5408.756s">But</a>  most of that's not going to help the businesses either, because it's the building owners, the owners of the building, and then it's businesses that are paying rent. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5415.459s">But</a>  there's stuff that we might be able to do, I'm thinking, outside the box in our community, like Councilor Knight said. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5420.925s">But</a>  I just, when the word mitigation came up, I heard loud and clear what they said that evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5426.407s">And</a>  I just don't want to mislead businesses in the community that may think they're going to get a big check from the Department of Transportation as a result of this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5435.491s">And</a>  I just think, I think we have to be fair to them and not give them false hopes that they're going to get a golden bar at the end of this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5445.336s">When</a>  the state clearly said when they were here, they're not in the business of paying mitigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5448.955s">But</a>  they will be willing to work with the city on maybe smaller projects in the immediate area. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5455.378s">If</a>  they're parking on a park to park their trucks during the thing, they'll do the park over maybe, or something like that, similar to the other projects that have taken place here within our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5466.543s">So</a>  I look forward to the future dialogue on this particular matter, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5478.271s">Again,</a>  there are subcontractors, as Council Marks has alluded to, that are going to be responsible. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5484.295s">The</a>  main contractor here, the signer of the contract is the Massachusetts Department of Transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5488.657s">That's</a>  the main contractor for the bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5490.758s">But</a>  you've got Spectra Energy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5492.259s">You've</a>  got National Grid. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5493.439s">You</a>  also even have the city of Medford involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5494.98s">You</a>  have the Massachusetts State Police. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5496.541s">You</a>  have the State Department of Conservation and Recreation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5499.703s">And</a>  there are other little subcontractors involved in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5502.744s">So</a>  I am not going to turn around and say mitigation is not a possibility when, in fact, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5507.703s">It</a>  could be a possibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5509.304s">And</a>  as far as the meeting goes today, it's another clear-cut example of this council being shut out on any types of meetings such as that, especially when they had a personal interest in this, especially on behalf of the Metro business folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5521.875s">And</a>  we've been discussing this for months upon months upon months, and not to be even notified about a meeting to go to. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5529.602s">It's</a>  just wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5530.743s">And</a>  that's where the whole sense of frustration comes about, a complete lack of transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5535.473s">And</a>  that's how mixed messages get sent around, not only to this building, but to the businesses within this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5541.695s">Hopefully,</a>  pretty soon, there'll be a major change in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5544.717s">And</a>  this will not go on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5545.877s">This</a>  will not be tolerated.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5549.619s">Mr.</a>  President, can we take? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5568.112s">to</a>  address the City Council on the police building. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5573.102s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5573.282s">Martin,</a>  please state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5575.306s">Welcome.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5581.27s">spirited</a>  debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5582.972s">This</a>  council, in the last two years, has actually accomplished something. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5587.095s">I</a>  was talking to people and they always say, well, what did they accomplish? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5589.778s">And</a>  I was actually able to tell them something. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5591.88s">I</a>  told them about the DPW yard. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5593.641s">I</a>  told them about getting rid of TV3. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5596.664s">You've</a>  actually made progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5598.005s">Not</a>  only that, in spite of arguing today, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5601.98s">This</a>  committee has done a lot better in communicating. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5606.804s">I</a>  know every once in a while you get heated, but it's doing a lot better, and I would ask that you continue to keep the tempers down and the conversation flowing, because you've been doing a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5618.613s">Also,</a>  when I drive by on Route 16 and I see the Pompeo Garage, it looks fantastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5623.596s">And</a>  you guys made that happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5625.438s">So</a>  in spite of it all, I just wanted to thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5629.801s">I</a>  wish there was a sticker. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5631.424s">that</a>  I could put on my truck that said, Blue Lives Matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5634.526s">The</a>  police department in this city is often overlooked or taken for granted. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5639.408s">We</a>  ask them to work in an environment not worthy of the sacrifice they make for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5645.271s">The</a>  policemen and women of Medford commit to work 24 hours a day, seven days a week, including weekends and holidays. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5653.215s">Give</a>  that some thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5655.096s">Like</a>  its officers, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5656.554s">the</a>  police headquarters is a building that is also open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and used even on weekends and holidays. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5666.739s">I</a>  can lecture you, the public, on how an ounce of prevention beats a pound of cure. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5672.742s">But</a>  unless you, the people, realize your obligation to stand behind the importance of a new building, it will never come to fruition. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5681.006s">I</a>  can tell you how our police headquarters <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5683.611s">is</a>  the second most important building in this city, second only to City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5688.493s">But</a>  if you, the people, do not value the role of the police department, this new structure will not be built. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5695.896s">For</a>  everyone has their own wish list of projects, be it an art center or a garage, an old house renovation, or a school improvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5706.14s">While</a>  everyone in this city gives lip service and verbalizes the need for a new police station, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5711.992s">and</a>  thanks the police for being there for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5714.713s">When</a>  push comes to shove, they choose the project that they value more over the need for a new police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5722.956s">I</a>  have no horse in this race. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5724.516s">I</a>  have no family member or friend on the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5728.378s">But</a>  I do know that without civil order, your other projects do not have a long shelf life. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5735.38s">My</a>  fear is that by the time we pay off enough old bonds, in quotes, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5742.612s">As</a>  has been stated by our politicians and administrators, the cry for new school funding will overshadow the police department once again, as the political will for schools usually do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5755.534s">Seven</a>  years is a long time, and a lot of these other new buildings are going to need a lot of major repair, and I fear that to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5762.775s">I'm</a>  not done, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5764.996s">Our</a>  police station was built in the early 1960s and is very outdated and has been unable to stand the test of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5772.539s">I</a>  repeat, has been unable to stand the test of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5777.701s">The</a>  role of the police building is not just to house the police and arrestees. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5781.842s">It</a>  is a place where policy and policing can be discussed by and with the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5788.164s">It</a>  should have a room for that purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5790.465s">It</a>  should be safe for officers and prisoners. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5793.306s">The</a>  building needs to be larger for detective work, technology updates, and technology I also include <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5799.857s">The</a>  fire department, which the chief came here, or one of their representatives came here and talked about how they don't have email, that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5807.363s">These</a>  are basic issues that need to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5811.086s">And</a>  when I talk about a police headquarters, I mean a police slash fire headquarters. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5817.351s">It</a>  needs to have secure witness-proof privacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5822.094s">In</a>  other words, somebody comes in, they witnessed a crime. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5827.198s">I</a>  want it to be <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5828.598s">a</a>  nice little quiet place for them to meet, to talk to the officers, so that they feel comfortable coming forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5836.041s">It</a>  needs to have evidence-proof lockers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5838.202s">It</a>  needs to have firearm safety and accessibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5841.104s">It</a>  needs to be located in a prominent position in the square accessible to all. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5846.026s">I</a>  personally have decided that I want it right where it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5848.867s">I</a>  like the location. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5849.888s">I</a>  want it bigger than it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5851.449s">And</a>  if things have to happen, then things have to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5854.75s">Because</a>  it also deters crime <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5857.265s">Just</a>  as when I see a police officer car and I'm driving down the street, I slow down. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5863.547s">If</a>  I see the police department, I'm going to say, oh, there, and it's going to remind me. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5868.529s">It</a>  is also a place where people feel comfortable that they should go to if they're lost, if they need help. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5874.451s">It</a>  should be visible so that if you want it, you know where it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5879.373s">Everyone</a>  agrees with this assessment from parents to the arts community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5883.114s">The</a>  problem is no one wants to pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5886.118s">The</a>  political will stops at the funding trough. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5890.519s">Allocating</a>  the money is where the city stops short of contracting this project out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5895.701s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5896.241s">Because</a>  everyone has their agenda, that they value more than the police building, including employees who sometimes would rather see a personal raise in their take-home pay than committing millions to a police building. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5909.805s">Everyone</a>  has their agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5911.186s">Parents</a>  want more teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5913.087s">Arts</a>  Council wants Springstep. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5915.211s">Politicians</a>  want to be reelected. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5918.075s">Everyone</a>  has a stake in not committing the millions of dollars required to have a full, real, state-of-the-art police building that the police could work out of. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5928.545s">that</a>  you, the people, can own and feel proud of. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5931.787s">The</a>  location of the police station should be right where it is, visible and accessible to everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5937.67s">And</a>  if that means taking some of the buildings out for eminent domain, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5942.132s">Everyone</a>  should know where the station is and it should be built large and welcoming. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5948.615s">I</a>  repeat, welcoming. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5952.025s">It</a>  should incorporate the drug education personnel to the judgment area for parking tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5958.81s">It</a>  should be viewed as everyone's building. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5963.313s">There</a>  is no immediate gratification in this build-out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5967.476s">Citizens</a>  of Medford, all, have their priorities and most do not have the police station at the top of their list. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5974.381s">Yet</a>  this building is open 24 hours a day and used by everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5978.745s">If</a>  you choose to ignore my advice, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5980.976s">Don't</a>  come crying to me when the police morale is down and time on a call lags, because you didn't care about taking care of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5989.739s">You</a>  want the best police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5991.98s">You</a>  want an engaged citizenry. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5994.42s">You</a>  want crime and drug issues to be handled. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5996.821s">This</a>  takes money. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=5998.962s">Money</a>  you will not see the immediate benefits of, but in the long run will pay off. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6004.664s">No</a>  other building project should even be discussed, i.e. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6007.385s">the</a>  garage or art centers, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6009.056s">until</a>  a police building is in the works. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6011.778s">And</a>  if a small amount of businesses need to be taken by eminent domain to make enough room for the police structure, that's a hit they will have to take, and we will have to compensate them for. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6023.684s">Public</a>  safety comes first. <a

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6027.366s">Thank</a>  you very much, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6028.407s">Martin.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6029.167s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6030.868s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6032.049s">I</a>  think, Gene, you brought up a lot of good points there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6035.33s">And</a>  I will say this, this whole council <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6038.955s">His</a>  uniform was standing behind the police station and warning one. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6043.297s">If</a>  you can recall, during last year's election, that was number one on everybody's list, including the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6051.56s">What</a>  was needed was a police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6054.081s">And,</a>  yeah, okay.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6056.242s">Oh,</a>  may I respond to that? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6057.462s">Councilor</a>  will finish his remarks.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6060.403s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6061.924s">That</a>  was the number one request of everybody, including the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6064.485s">Again,</a>  now we're, two years have gone, a new election's coming up, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6069.688s">And</a>  everyone's going to ask, what's the number one priority again? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6071.909s">And</a>  we're all going to say the police station again. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6074.53s">And</a>  now we have a chance where there's going to be a new mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6079.952s">Let's</a>  see where the new mayor stands on, or the new potential mayor stands on this police station project. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6087.255s">I</a>  mean, the one that's running currently, as said when she was the budget director, that she didn't think it would be possible for seven years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6099.63s">seven</a>  years, so it means we have to wait seven, it's gonna take three to build, that's 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6104.892s">The</a>  city can't wait 10 years to build another police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6108.334s">I</a>  agree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6109.194s">I</a>  mean, you're right, it's a 24 hour building, it's just as important as city hall is, because they don't, this building closes and the holidays and the weekends, they're open, they never stop working. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6120.059s">It's</a>  not fair to our policemen and the men and women who work in there, that they work in those conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6126.382s">They're</a>  jammed in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6128.847s">Now</a>  they've branched over into the former training facility that's not used anymore as a training facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6137.093s">It's</a>  high time that this becomes a main point of the new election coming up over how that is going to get built and funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6148.902s">I</a>  do agree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6152.124s">It</a>  should be one of the biggest points asked of the new mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6157.303s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6158.544s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6158.824s">Please.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6159.605s">With</a>  all due respect, the budget director did say it would take seven years, and that's my problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6166.191s">That's</a>  too long.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6167.311s">That's</a>  absolutely... Or seven before we could even start talking about it.</p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6171.735s">Which</a>  is ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6172.896s">No</a>  offense to anybody.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6174.037s">So</a>  seven and then three years, the bill means 10 years.</p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6177.02s">It's</a>  ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6177.72s">It</a>  is? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6177.9s">I</a>  agree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6178.261s">It</a>  needs to happen and it needs to start now.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6179.662s">This</a>  whole group of seven, I think, agrees with you there.</p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6182.733s">With</a>  all due respect to the administration, it's too late. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6186.114s">It</a>  has to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6188.235s">It</a>  has to be now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6189.536s">Because</a>  in seven years, there's going to be more buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6192.437s">There's</a>  going to be more holes in this ceiling. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6194.057s">There's</a>  going to be more issues that are going to come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6195.778s">And</a>  schools will come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6197.979s">And</a>  the parents have a very large voice in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6200.16s">No</a>  offense to the parents, but they have a very large voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6203.001s">And</a>  when the school kids come in and you see the fourth graders, you're going to cry for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6208.543s">And</a>  they always lose to the police, always lose out.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6211.482s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6213.384s">You</a>  are correct, because you're already starting to see a little bit of a groundswell of people talking about a new high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6220.03s">And</a>  again, as I'm out around, I hear that, how about a new high school, when we're going to build a new high school?</p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6228.221s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6228.641s">And</a>  I'm in agreement with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6230.022s">This</a>  whole committee said that they want a new police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6233.125s">Every</a>  single one of them said that's at the top of their list. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6235.186s">And</a>  I commend you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6236.727s">But</a>  the people, I'm not talking to you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6239.429s">I'm</a>  talking to those folks out there because they're the ones that have to put the pressure to get the police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6244.113s">And</a>  they have to realize that there is going to be, have to be a sacrifice on their part because it's not going to happen unless they sacrifice.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6251.899s">If</a>  you recall at one of the meetings, uh, I was the one that brought up a possibility of a two and a half override. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6258.063s">which</a>  got shot down in a matter of like three seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6261.528s">I</a>  mean, I know we've never had one, but maybe that might be the end.</p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6265.454s">It</a>  needs to be bonded, and it needs to be bonded now.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6267.136s">Maybe</a>  that's the avenue that we may have to go.</p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6269.379s">It</a>  has to be bonded.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6270.201s">But</a>  I was told that that will not happen in this administration.</p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6273.622s">With</a>  all due respect, if we needed to bond for a new high school, there would be parents right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6279.448s">And</a>  it's not the same as when you see a bunch of police officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6282.091s">We</a>  have 100 police officers in their families. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6284.753s">They</a>  don't compare in the voice, the political voice, compared to the school department, school committee, and all those parents and all those kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6293.082s">God</a>  bless them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6294.513s">But</a>  it will happen, and the police will get pushed to the back of the line once again. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6300.375s">So</a>  when that happens, don't come crying to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6303.096s">That's</a>  all I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6304.196s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6305.256s">Councilor</a>  Knight has the floor next. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6307.517s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6308.838s">And</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6309.078s">Martin,</a>  thank you very much for that thorough analysis. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6312.759s">One</a>  of the things that you said really stuck out to me, and that was the fact that seven years is too long, because in seven years, we're going to look at our school buildings that are going to be deteriorating. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6321.462s">And</a>  I think that's a major problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6323.281s">And</a>  we have a brand new DPW yard, just built, just built. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6326.722s">The</a>  paint's not even dry yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6328.563s">What's</a>  our capital maintenance plan at the DPW yard? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6330.943s">This</a>  is our city's number one asset. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6332.444s">This</a>  is the largest investment we've made in quite some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6334.745s">What's</a>  our plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6335.805s">What</a>  are we going to do to be sure that this stays a state-of-the-art facility, so that 10 years down the line, we're not looking to borne money to fix something we've already fixed, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6343.707s">Martin.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6343.947s">So</a>  I think that that's a great assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6346.608s">And</a>  that leads me into my point. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6348.669s">We</a>  need to have a capital improvement fund in the city of Medford for our buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6353.107s">And</a>  without that, we're going to be behind the eight ball all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6357.088s">Until</a>  we actually take care of the facilities that we own, and perpetual maintenance care isn't a bad idea, a perpetual fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6365.892s">That's</a>  something that I support, a capital maintenance and trust fund, where we dedicate a certain portion of our city's budget to a trust fund, just for the purpose of maintaining and upkeeping the current buildings that we have, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6376.015s">So,</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6376.396s">Martin,</a>  I think that that was a very good point that you made, because there are going to be competing interests. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6380.59s">the</a>  more time that goes on if, in fact, we don't have a capital maintenance plan to keep the buildings and the existing assets that we have up to par to be livable, to be workable, to be usable. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6390.432s">So</a>  thank you very much for taking the time to come up here and provide us with that thoughtful analysis.</p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6394.493s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6394.873s">And</a>  I do agree also. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6396.113s">One</a>  second. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6396.594s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6397.794s">I</a>  do agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6398.414s">I'm</a>  totally for a 5%, whatever that number is, for a maintenance plan for every single city building. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6404.675s">I</a>  am totally on board with that before we do anything else.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6407.68s">and</a>  I believe that was part of the new school construction that was never followed through on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6412.401s">Councilor</a>  Knight, you're all set? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6414.102s">Mr.</a>  President, I rest. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6415.502s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6416.422s">Councilor</a>  Panto. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6417.202s">Just</a>  on that point, I'm glad you just brought that up because I was alluding to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6420.603s">When</a>  we built our new school buildings, they've gone on 13 years now, if not more, the 5% on an annual basis was supposed to be each school budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6429.725s">The</a>  state never came in here to monitor that, to see if it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6433.686s">Now,</a>  Councilor Caraviello, on the second year of his term, in year two, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6437.61s">brought</a>  up a report that had $1,200,000 of repairs for the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6440.093s">Isn't</a>  that correct, sir? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6440.994s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6441.474s">$1,200,000</a>  for schools were no more, at that point in time, maybe 12 years old, 10, 11, 12 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6444.838s">And</a>  we're worried about <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6452.666s">a</a>  new police station and making sure that it's going to be rehabbed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6455.889s">Look</a>  up at the ceiling there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6456.85s">You</a>  see that ceiling right there? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6458.151s">I</a>  do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6458.411s">That's</a>  been like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6459.272s">You</a>  know how long? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6460.553s">That's</a>  been going on almost three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6462.754s">And</a>  the superintendent of the schools is sitting exactly where the gentleman is sitting there when that ceiling came down, and he's lucky he didn't get killed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6468.98s">This</a>  is what the city's idea of maintenance is right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6472.322s">Cover</a>  the hole up, patch it up, and maybe nothing will be said. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6475.465s">You</a>  heard it tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6476.186s">You</a>  heard about the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6477.146s">You</a>  heard about the bathrooms, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6479.248s">You</a>  go through the infrastructure of our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6481.853s">There</a>  were just so many things that for the past many years have been ignored, completely and totally ignored, whitewashed over. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6489.639s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6490.559s">Because</a>  you know why? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6491.6s">Because</a>  at all these bonds that the city has outstanding there, they're all going to be paid on a back end. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6497.685s">So</a>  it's interest only for the first five or six years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6501.167s">God</a>  bless whoever the next mayor is going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6503.529s">And</a>  I hope I have a chance to do this because I want to revitalize that whole situation on how <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6509.582s">this</a>  city is going to pay for those bonds in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6512.723s">Do</a>  you realize on the fifth and the sixth year what the cost is going to be in this particular budget to pay for those bonds? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6518.165s">You</a>  won't see any new buildings in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6519.745s">You'll</a>  just be paying off for the bonds that you have here right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6524.327s">So</a>  what needs to take place here is a thorough and an exhaustive review of how these buildings are going to be reviewed, how these buildings are going to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6533.983s">This</a>  past year, the school department budget passed $2 million additional dollars from last year to this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6540.626s">God</a>  knows what they have in it for this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6542.827s">Salaries</a>  increased, as the councilor to my right, Councilor Lungo-Koehn and current. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6546.368s">Some</a>  people got $20,000 salary increases, and I believe there was almost $32 million in transfers from last year's budget before the end of the year took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6557.013s">So</a>  how are we talking about that being a legitimate budget when you pass it in the beginning of the year? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6561.315s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6562.266s">These</a>  are all tricks of the trade, apparently, that have been going on for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6565.947s">But</a>  if you have, all of a sudden, $2 million in additional dollars, and you start hiring extra people at $90,000 and $100,000 a year, and you take it away from the classroom, you take it away from the teachers, you take it away from the supplies, and you take it away from the front entrance of that high school, it looks like it's bombed out, like a war zone, because the bricks and everything are shattered. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6584.972s">I'm</a>  surprised there are enough kids that have not broken their ankles or their legs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6588.493s">Handles</a>  still off the front door to come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6591.154s">That's</a>  wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6592.32s">And</a>  when the parent goes up there and looks at it and says, is that where I'm going to send my kid? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6596.242s">Do</a>  I really want my kid to go there? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6598.484s">That's</a>  why they get forced to go to these private schools, because appearance, as you know, is the name of the game. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6606.108s">They</a>  spent $500,000 to redo this building over, just this council chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6610.591s">I</a>  think it cost $497,000 to build the entire building, PWA days. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6613.252s">But</a>  $500,000 to do this over. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6618.139s">That's</a>  been like that for three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6619.46s">And</a>  then the molding, if you look at the molding, that's ready to go and that's coming down and nothing's been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6624.064s">Nothing</a>  in the budget, no repair work, no nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6626.446s">And</a>  y'all worried about a police station and they can't even figure out how to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6632.271s">The</a>  next administration hopefully will be a work in composite between the council and the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6638.276s">And</a>  there's going to be a meeting of the minds. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6640.363s">And</a>  so that way there, when the money is going to be spent, it's going to be spent, and everybody's going to be on board to understand how it's going to be spent, when it's going to be spent, and where it's going to be spent for. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6649.267s">That</a>  hasn't taken place here in 28 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6651.808s">But</a>  I can assure you, it will take place.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6670.272s">we</a>  laid on the table last week to this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6673.855s">On</a>  the motion of a council paper to take a couple of Penta to take a paper off the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6679.478s">All</a>  those in favor of those opposed 15 for 79, the future of Lawrence Memorial hospitals to be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6687.224s">Councilor</a>  Penta.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6688.225s">Mr.</a>  President, as a result of, unfortunately the merger that did not take place between partners and Lawrence Memorial hospital and the Melrose Wakefield on January 29th of this past year, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6699.415s">when</a>  the judge, Judge Sanders, issued her 48-page decision not agreeing to this because she did not believe that what Martha Coakley had put together was going to work in the best interests of the hospitals mentioned in as well as offshore. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6714.084s">And</a>  then on top of that, Martha Healy, Maura Healy, the new attorney general coming in and likewise not only supporting the judge, but nixing the whole deal and was willing and is willing to go to court. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6728.471s">I</a>  believe we have a council resolution asking her and both parties to be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6733.034s">I've</a>  taken the time to speak to some doctors and some employees up at the Lawrence Memorial Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6740.199s">And</a>  since at the present time, the third and the fourth floor of the hospital is not being used to any type of its potential, never mind its maximum, I'd like to make an offering and throw this back out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6751.928s">And</a>  hopefully it gets back to not only the Lawrence Memorial, but to partners, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6756.21s">If</a>  we take a look at the doctors that are operating here in the city of Medford that are Hallmark Hospital doctors and at the same time private practitioners, and offer them room and space on the third and fourth floor of the hospital, and leaving the first and second floors available for emergency, for prompt care, emergency services, and what's presently in there right now, it would be a way not only to utilize the hospital <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6781.222s">with</a>  a complete medical density of doctors, no matter what their professions might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6786.966s">And</a>  at the same time, make the offering to partners, rather than have the Lawrence be part of a consortium, which included the South Shore, which included Melrose-Wakefield. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6797.333s">It</a>  could be an independent, isolated medical facility that the partners, Mass General, would be willing to entertain, which would not have to go through any type of a consortium, or a review, or to go through a <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6811.896s">48-page</a>  review. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6813.857s">People</a>  don't realize that the Lawrence Memorial Hospital was in a profit-making position before this whole idea of this merger took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6822.263s">And</a>  for the last few years, a lot of its finances and a lot of its profits have been carried over to the Melrose-Wakefield. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6829.347s">And</a>  unfortunately for the Lawrence Memorial, they did not receive the same benefits that the Melrose-Wakefield Hospital has received most recently over the past two to three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6839.738s">And</a>  that's maybe because the former president, who's no longer the president, who left the day after the deal didn't go through, did not have the same feeling to the Lawrence Memorial as he had as being president over at the Melrose-Wakefield. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6853.664s">But</a>  I think this would really bode well for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6856.285s">I</a>  think it would bode well for our citizens, seniors, mothers with babies, emergency room, prompt care locations, and for any other doctor that might be having a situation where <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6867.362s">either</a>  parking presents itself with a problem, location presents itself with a problem, but if they were all centrally located, because everybody knows where the Lawrence Memorial Hospital is, and if they were centrally located there, and they worked their offices out of that building, and even if they looked at the positioning that the doctors, to some degree, are not part of the nonprofit, and there is a way to legally separate the buildings or the floors or what have you, because anything is possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6893.027s">So</a>  that's why I'm throwing this out there as a possibility <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6896.124s">to</a>  keep as many doctors as we can here, but also the greater possibility to bring Mass General partners here into the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6903.45s">They</a>  have a great interest in Mr. Cardiology. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6906.092s">They</a>  think it's a great team of doctors that are there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6908.894s">They</a>  were one of the first, if not the first group of doctors that partners, I believe, entertain for the purposes of hopefully being part of this consortium. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6916.721s">But</a>  again, unfortunately on January 29th when the deal did not go through and Judge Sanders didn't approve it because she felt that for which Martha Coakley <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6924.775s">had</a>  put in her request for the merger that the cost would not be contained, as they said it would be for a six-year period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6933.837s">And</a>  as a result of that, I believe there were 50 independent doctors and medical professionals and presidents of other hospitals, local area hospitals, who did not want it, did not believe it would serve in the best interest of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6946.241s">And</a>  I believe that's the reason why. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6947.461s">That's</a>  what the 48-page decision says. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6951.275s">So,</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I move, Mr. Clerk, and I don't know if the words are going to be very probably general right now, that the Lawrence Memorial Hospital look at entertaining the utilization of their third and fourth floor locations for the purposes of offering to all Medford doctors an opportunity to house their private practices there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=6982.986s">in</a>  concert with the first and second, with the emergency and prompt care, the other medical facilities that the Lawrence Memorial offers now, and present that to the Partners Mass General Board, our president.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7000.675s">Just</a>  for the point of clarity, Councilor, that the Hallmark Health presented to the Partners Board.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7007.998s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7008.778s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7009.799s">For</a>  the purposes of presenting to the Hallmark Health, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7014.373s">in</a>  essence, and may present that to partners, Mass General, for the purposes of being an independent affiliate of the Mass General and not part of the original consortium. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7029.476s">Do</a>  you have it, Eddie? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7030.756s">You</a>  may have to go back and watch the video.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7033.957s">I</a>  think that was one more point of clarification, Councilor, for the point of voting on this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7039.258s">Was</a>  anything of what you said done in consultation with an official from Hallmark Health?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7044.962s">Not</a>  with homelike help, but speaking with their doctors, nurses, and as well as patients who thought it was a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7050.323s">But</a>  doctors and nurses, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7053.104s">So</a>  that's a negative.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7056.565s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7062.447s">Madam</a>  Vice President.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7063.487s">Just</a>  a point of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7065.027s">Sorry,</a>  I wanted to. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7065.647s">There's</a>  a third and fourth floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7067.268s">There's</a>  a third and fourth floor, so to house. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7068.668s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7068.808s">So</a>  we're just asking the question, have them discuss it.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7074.597s">On</a>  that motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7075.437s">Roll</a>  call vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7075.998s">Mr.</a>  President and have that forwarded to the hallmark board of directors to be forwarded to home, uh, to be forwarded to a partners mass general.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7087.101s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7089.842s">Councilor</a>  Camuso, Councilor Caraviello, Councilor Knight, vice-president Long and Kern.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7096.865s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7098.785s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7099.506s">Councilor</a>  Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7100.166s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7100.896s">President</a>  Dello Russo? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7101.757s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7102.497s">On</a>  the vote of one absent, two in the negative, four in the affirmative, the motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7111.745s">Papers</a>  in the hands of the clerk, offered under suspension by President Dello Russo and Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7118.47s">Be</a>  it resolved that the City Solicitor advise and render an opinion to the Council as to the process and parameters for the Council to establish a Charter Review Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7129.415s">It's</a>  pretty self-explanatory, and we can discuss it when we get a response back to us.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7135.16s">On</a>  the motion, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7135.98s">On</a>  the motion, Councilor Penta.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7138.182s">I</a>  am absolutely perplexed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7140.064s">You</a>  and Councilor Knight are both offering these resolutions, but when this was presented over here for the purposes of possibly entertaining it by Mr. Stirello, the both of you were opposed to it, and now all of a sudden you're for it, and the people who had an opportunity to speak on it aren't even here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7155.536s">I</a>  respectfully request that I lay on the table <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7158.345s">And</a>  anyone interested who might be watching can come next week to discuss this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7161.608s">Because</a>  I think this is way too important of an issue to not have the public either be advised of it, but I'm just dumbfounded that people who are against it now want to get an opinion when you didn't want to do it back then.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7174.297s">We're</a>  just asking for an opinion.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7177.4s">But</a>  you refused the gentleman when he came before, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7180.542s">So</a>  what changed your mind?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7183.532s">Mr.</a>  President, I signed on to this resolution because I want to know what the process is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7187.074s">There</a>  are multiple processes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7188.155s">This</a>  council can do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7189.215s">There</a>  can be a citizen-driven petition as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7191.717s">I</a>  think it's important for the city clerk to come out and provide us with the perimeters, which venue we can recommend people take, which direction people may want to go or may not want to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7200.502s">If</a>  there aren't enough votes for it here in the council, at least people know what direction to go, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7204.705s">So</a>  I see no problem bringing the resolution forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7207.186s">There</a>  were citizens that came here and then asked this council to make a decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7209.927s">At</a>  that point in time, I wasn't ready to support that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7211.767s">At</a>  this point in time, I am. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7212.988s">I've</a>  done a little bit of homework. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7213.948s">I've</a>  done a little bit of research on the matter, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7216.449s">So</a>  I don't think that it's that outlandish. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7219.41s">I</a>  don't think it's crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7220.91s">I</a>  don't think it's insane to bring this conversation topic forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7224.591s">I</a>  don't think it's insane, crazy, or outlandish to ask for the question, to be answered by a clerk, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7231.005s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7233.647s">I</a>  know Councilor Knight is new to the council, but this question has been brought up on several occasions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7239.871s">And</a>  I think some of the surprise is that there's been members of this council adamantly opposed to even looking at the city charter, let alone review it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7250.197s">So</a>  I think that's some of the surprise. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7251.758s">I</a>  know you're relatively new to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7253.76s">Myself</a>  and other members of the council have supported this type of initiative and type of review. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7259.497s">and</a>  feel that it should be built into the city charter that calls for a periodical review of the city charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7265.263s">So</a>  I think that's where some of the surprise comes in. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7269.007s">And</a>  I offered a resolution, I think it was a year and a half, two years ago, and I won't speak out of turn, but the president at the time, Councilor Dello Russo said, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7279.974s">He</a>  has never had anyone approach him regarding the city charter and didn't see a need to even look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7285.698s">And</a>  that was, you know, pretty close to a quote that he said. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7288.96s">So</a>  I think some of us are concerned now because, you know, when the mayor was in office, there wasn't the feeling by some members of the council to review the charter when the mayor was in power. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7303.029s">You</a>  know, and now all of a sudden the mayor is going by the wayside. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7307.393s">And</a>  now, all of a sudden, these same members want to take a look at the city charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7312.354s">So</a>  maybe they had an epiphany. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7313.915s">Who</a>  knows? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7315.075s">You</a>  know? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7315.675s">Maybe</a>  you did a good job debating. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7317.516s">And</a>  good luck to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7318.476s">But</a>  I've always been supportive of a charter review for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7322.537s">And</a>  my record has always been one for looking at the city charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7327.258s">It's</a>  the way the city government operates. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7329.639s">Any</a>  paper that was developed 28 years ago, like any business plan, you wouldn't be in business too long if you had <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7335.9s">the</a>  business plan from 28 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7337.922s">You</a>  have to change with the times. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7339.784s">And</a>  so I welcome this, and I welcome to see how my colleagues that were once opposed to this move forward with this.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7348.031s">And</a>  I, too, think that, you know, figuring out what the process is and figuring out what direction we need to go in if we feel as though there are changes necessary is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7355.858s">It's</a>  important for us to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7356.719s">It's</a>  important for the people to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7357.66s">I'm</a>  on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7357.94s">And</a>  more importantly, I think, with the change in administration, there is a certain <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7363.163s">sense</a>  of insecurity or a sense of maybe uncertainty and instability right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7368.367s">And</a>  I think that if we're going to make the change, now's the time to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7370.568s">If</a>  things are changing, let's really take a long hard look at what's going on.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7373.731s">Point</a>  of clarification.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7374.731s">Point</a>  of clarification, Councilor Penta.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7376.833s">Is</a>  the Council's sense saying that there is a — when the — at present administration, there was a security sense here, but now there is a sense of insecurity?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7384.879s">I</a>  misspoke. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7385.779s">I</a>  misspoke. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7386.56s">Instability</a>  versus insecurity was the term that I meant to use, Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7390.182s">Well,</a>  that's even worse.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7391.813s">Well,</a>  you don't think that there's a sense of instability here in the community of Medford right now with the 28-year mayor that's resigning and going, not resigning, I'm sorry, retiring. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7400.959s">There</a>  are two good candidates that are going to be in the race over here and hopefully maybe the best woman will win, a man will win.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7406.723s">I</a>  really think the people of this community are smart enough to understand and to realize that when this issue has been brought up, as it has been brought up, and I really am going to respectfully ask my colleagues to lay it on the table so that way the people who are watching it can come next week and discuss it, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7421.693s">And</a>  I think, Councilor De La Rosa, you owe it to the public to come down from the chair and explain why you're putting this resolution on when you were wholeheartedly against it before. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7428.819s">Because</a>  this doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7431.001s">You</a>  have to stand behind that for what you're proffering. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7433.623s">You</a>  just can't turn around and put a resolution on and not tell the people why. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7437.266s">This</a>  is such a huge, huge issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7439.968s">You're</a>  talking about the community's charter that you were diabolically opposed to before. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7445.291s">Now</a>  all of a sudden, out of the clear blue sky, and I don't know who put this bug in your ear, to have this resolution come before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7454.012s">If</a>  you're that much for it, well, then why don't you just have the city solicitor come forward and just tell him, Mr. Solicitor, there seems to be a feeling in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7463.197s">Could</a>  you just come here and explain it? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7465.778s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7466.459s">I</a>  don't think you thought this up on your own, because that would be just too good to be true. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7470.561s">The</a>  fact of the matter is, you sat there, and you were against it, same as he was, and same as Councilor Camuso.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7476.084s">Mr.</a>  President, most are to withdraw.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7479.726s">God.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7482.068s">He</a>  moved that the paper lay on the table and allow the people to come next week who have an interest on this particular subject matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7488.753s">You</a>  had an 80 year old gentleman who was walking the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7492.817s">It</a>  basically embarrassed them and insulted them at the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7498.501s">No,</a>  no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7500.503s">He</a>  said things were all right the way they were to me.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7502.885s">That's</a>  like saying I'm not going to have you characterize my words. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7505.547s">Councilor</a>  Knight withdraws his name from the petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7509.883s">I</a>  leave my name on it.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7510.483s">I</a>  thought this was a good thing, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7511.803s">I</a>  thought this was a good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7512.724s">I</a>  thought this was something that, you know what I mean?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7514.924s">It</a>  is a good thing, but I just want to know why. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7516.745s">Why</a>  the change?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7517.205s">We</a>  can work together. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7518.145s">I</a>  think that the future is what we should be focused on as opposed to the past.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7521.666s">I</a>  think the motion to table should be withdrawn and that we should send a solicitor and then we can discuss it when it comes back to us.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7528.847s">Why</a>  are you afraid to let people come and talk on it?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7531.268s">I'm</a>  not at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7532.108s">We'll</a>  have an answer and we'll discuss it then.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7537.313s">Are</a>  you withdrawing the motion to table? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7538.514s">No,</a>  there's people who want to talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7539.674s">I</a>  don't want to talk.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7540.214s">You,</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7542.756s">Is</a>  there a motion if the table, if it's, if there's a motion to table. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7546.317s">What</a>  is wrong? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7547.938s">Is</a>  the motion to table withdrawn, councillor? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7550.299s">I'm</a>  not, no, I'm not withdrawing it because I. The motion is tabled.</p>

    <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7728.213s">Good</a>  evening, again. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7729.254s">Anthony</a>  D'Antonio, 12 Yale Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7731.876s">I</a>  can't remember how many months ago it was, but I started a committee, just a grassroots committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7740.502s">And</a>  I have 57 members on it right now of people that were very much interested in reviewing the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7746.327s">It's</a>  very important because it's a very old document. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7751.03s">I</a>  know that Councilor Penta was on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7754.008s">At</a>  the initial change from plan E to plan A, there were a lot of amendments left out of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7762.73s">Amendments</a>  that hurt the citizens of Medford because they weren't getting fair representation for their tax dollars, among other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7769.772s">But</a>  I do recall when I came before, I had a discussion with Solicitor Rumley, and we had a miscommunication. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7777.168s">And</a>  I tried to get to him before he went on vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7779.269s">He</a>  took a long weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7780.55s">And</a>  I came before the council somewhat unprepared, but the emotion that I was trying to get across was to get a feel from the councillors, would you be amenable to having a commission set up where I believe each one of your councillors can pick somebody to go on the, on the committee or the commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7798.942s">And</a>  it was shot down four to three. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7802.064s">And</a>  I think councillor Marchant voted for it, Penta and Biannalonga. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7808.117s">And</a>  it's very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7809.218s">I</a>  mean, I know it's an election year and I know, you know, this is the right thing to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7812.84s">It</a>  was the right thing to do 10 years ago, 15 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7815.181s">I</a>  mean, charter should review, be reviewed at least a minimum every five years because things change all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7821.765s">So</a>  I just wanted to get that straight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7824.507s">And</a>  there are a lot of people from that committee that I started. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7828.309s">There</a>  were hundreds that want to see a review of the charter because they don't understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7832.852s">They</a>  don't understand why what happens here on Tuesday nights happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7837.459s">Why</a>  don't you have authority to do this? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7839.42s">Why</a>  do we spend this? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7840.24s">Why</a>  do we need to be some changes? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7842.12s">We</a>  need to have a balance of power. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7843.621s">So</a>  there was a vote taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7845.521s">And</a>  as I said, it got stuffed four to three. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7847.962s">So</a>  anyway, that's all I wanted to say.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7852.463s">And</a>  please state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[acqgxK4yhEM_SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7854.584s">Mario</a>  Martin of 18 Benton Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7858.085s">A</a>  review of the charge is absolutely necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7861.506s">I</a>  think that if you use the analogy of an old, outdated computer, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7866.285s">You</a>  can start to see that after the computer gets really slow, it's not working, you have to reboot it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7875.312s">You</a>  have to add to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7876.272s">You</a>  have to upgrade it and update it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7877.753s">In</a>  a fast-evolving, fast-changing society, it's absolutely necessary to change this charter, to see the rules of government, to see how <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7892.323s">the</a>  charter in general can help society. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7894.265s">So</a>  I think it's absolutely necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7896.086s">I</a>  think it's time that we start looking at changing the language in it and making sure that we can address issues for the city where this charter isn't really addressing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7909.398s">So</a>  that's all. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7910.599s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7910.879s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7915.383s">Could</a>  this state name and address for the record? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7917.425s">Michael</a>  Agiro. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7918.146s">I</a>  live on 18 Pembroke Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7920.245s">I</a>  think it's absolutely essential that we review the charter, but we need to do it in a public forum where people have the opportunity to speak about the pros and cons of different systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7929.349s">It's</a>  a little disconcerting to me because I review the agenda every night, and I didn't see this item on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7934.472s">It</a>  kind of surprised me. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7936.353s">I'm</a>  all for a charter review, but let's do it in a kind of environment that allows for a diversity of voices from the community to participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7944.177s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7949.815s">Is</a>  there a motion, Councilor Knight? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7952.617s">If</a>  I could ask the folks involved with this Chatter Review Commission that's been put together when the next meeting is.</p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7958.34s">I'm</a>  meeting with City Solicitor Romley on Thursday.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7969.406s">No,</a>  I'm talking about Mr. D'Antonio, actually, and to the committee that he was speaking about.</p>

    <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7973.789s">Anthony</a>  D'Antonio, Yale Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7976.971s">This</a>  was an ad hoc committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7980.444s">which</a>  came about because of the frustration of many citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7983.345s">This</a>  is not a, uh, you know, you don't have a charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7987.787s">We</a>  just was a group of people to met.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7989.948s">I</a>  just didn't know if you were meeting again in the near future.</p>

    <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7992.349s">No,</a>  because what I, uh, what's happening now is because it's an election year and a lot of people busy with different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7998.292s">Um,</a>  and I have a couple of other avenues I've been, you know, going down. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8004.995s">I'm</a>  hoping that the, um, the next administrator, the next mayor in the city of Medford, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8010.382s">We'll</a>  understand that this needs to be done, and we'll go along with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8013.385s">It's</a>  quite an operation to get this thing going. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8017.168s">I</a>  think to go the signature way is 5,500 signatures. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8021.131s">Then</a>  there's a process with this, that, and the other, and it takes a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8023.833s">But</a>  as I said, councilors can vote a commission, I believe, if I'm not mistaken, can vote a commission to work on the charter, and it needs a lot of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8032.661s">There's</a>  a lot of weak spots in the charter.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8035.905s">Mr.</a>  D'Antoni, we've put some effort in and done some work on this and, um, you know, having dealt with you, I know that it's going to be good work and it's going to be thorough. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8043.512s">Um,</a>  would you be willing to share that information with the council once we get our response back from the solicitor as to what your notes reflected minute, minute, meeting minutes and stuff like that from the ad hoc committee?</p>

    <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8053.18s">We</a>  have some minutes of what we've done.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8054.842s">If</a>  you could share that with us, that might be helpful.</p>

    <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8056.303s">It's</a>  not in the conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8057.004s">Pretty</a>  much what we did, what we discussed was the need for the change in the charter or the review of the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8062.704s">And</a>  not so much to besmirch the mayor or anything like that, because it's a very fine line when you're trying to work with somebody who's been mayor for 28 years in a charter that's been in existence from the year before he became mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8075.934s">So</a>  it's a fine line, because there's a lot of different opinions of everything and everybody out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8081.518s">And</a>  that was difficult, because we shook out the people that just wanted to come in and lambaste the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8085.48s">We</a>  didn't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8086.938s">And</a>  then, you know, so it's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8090.079s">The</a>  goal was to get this city back in the, back in the green and the black and everything.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8096.282s">I</a>  don't think anybody behind this rail is questioning your motives, sir.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8099.063s">I'm</a>  going to clarify some information.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8105.486s">Madam</a>  Vice President.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8106.306s">If</a>  I can recall too, when it was before the council a number of times and the committee, your committee was started and Mr. Starello was a big advocate, Capucci, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8117.244s">was</a>  a big advocate, and I think you had a lot of meetings, and you did a lot of work, and then the council took that vote of three to four, and everything kind of died down after that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8125.07s">So</a>  maybe now, if we can uniformly say we need to review the charter, we can move, you know, your committee and the city can move forward with, you know, reviewing the charter and seeing what needs to be changed in the future.</p>

    <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8137.36s">And</a>  as I said, it is a committee, ad hoc, and not a commission, not a duly registered commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8143.364s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. D'Antonio.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8146.226s">Just</a>  a point. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8147.307s">Is</a>  there a motion on the floor? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8148.787s">Point</a>  of clarification to those meetings, uh, um, Tony, um, when we were at those meetings, one of the things that were brought up, that was pretty much not clear because a lot of people didn't go back to 30 years when this whole change of government took place way back when it wasn't just a one option issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8169.134s">It</a>  was a double option. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8170.234s">You</a>  could retain the council manager, former government, or you could go forward with the strong AMIA and, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8177.085s">A</a>  lot of people seem to think that that wasn't the way it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8179.687s">We</a>  had 32 meetings, 32 meetings, open to the public, open and notorious. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8185.551s">And</a>  then we had, I believe there was a Charter Review Committee, and then there became a Charter Commission, was elected citywide throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8193.418s">And</a>  then, I believe it's some year after that, it's a four to five year process. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8198.402s">This</a>  isn't an overnight thing, and people think it's gonna change overnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8202.105s">This</a>  is open and notorious. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8203.546s">There</a>  were many, many meetings, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8205.27s">And</a>  if you digest each and every part of the segments of the charter, that's what this thing was all about, and that's where it was going. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8211.592s">The</a>  unfortunate part, even though the vote was four to three, the unfortunate part about many good things were starting to come about. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8218.174s">And</a>  I think all we were looking for, all that I guess you guys were looking for at the time, and I was willing to support, was having each council become involved with a citizen, with a committee, and going over it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8230.919s">And</a>  then when the time came to make a presentation, you make a presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8234.559s">That's</a>  all that it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8235.54s">This</a>  wasn't trying to upstage anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8237.981s">And</a>  you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8238.801s">This</a>  wasn't out there to smash anybody or anything like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8241.702s">It</a>  was run very logically and very, very courteously. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8245.504s">People</a>  expressed their opinions as what they wanted to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8248.885s">And</a>  again, I just, you know, I still think there are other people out there who would like to come and speak on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8255.328s">And</a>  just all due respect to my colleagues, I just ask that it lay on the table until next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8259.67s">And</a>  at least that way, there are people, if they want to come, they come. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8263.005s">At</a>  least they had an opportunity to know it's there.</p>

    <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8265.126s">Through</a>  the chair to Councilor Penta, I do know the work that you did on the charter, because I read it and re-read it and read it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8272.968s">And</a>  I do know that they omitted some very important revisions, amendments, clauses in there that sort of shot a whole lot of holes for that charter back then, Plan A. And one of the things people have to know, there were nine members on the commission.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8290.234s">And</a>  just like the US Constitution when it was passed, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8293.003s">It</a>  was very marginal on each one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8295.465s">Many</a>  of them were 5 to 4, 6 to 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8297.687s">There</a>  weren't many that were really overwhelming. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8300.068s">And</a>  you're going to probably find this on this particular issue, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8302.55s">But</a>  you know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8303.791s">This</a>  charter to be looked at today is going to be for the benefit of the citizens of tomorrow, for the people who are 20, 30, and 40 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8310.696s">I</a>  mean, we're at an age right now, you know, we're living within something that's already there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8314.619s">It's</a>  been established. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8316.405s">But</a>  whoever the administrator, and whoever the new council's gonna be, your job isn't for today, your job is how, where this city's gonna be going for tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8323.648s">It's</a>  direction, and how are we gonna enhance the vitality and rejuvenate this city to a point that's saying, hey, our government is working with us and it's moving forward with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8332.711s">And</a>  Jeannie, whether it's a brand new police station or not, how we're gonna get there, that's what you need to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8338.193s">How</a>  it's gonna be financed, that's what you need to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8340.833s">You</a>  just can't say you want something. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8342.614s">This</a>  is how we're gonna do it, and it's gonna be collective, it'll be a collective <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8345.562s">that</a>  it'll be a cleft of thought process to get to that point, something that's been sort of like missing for a long period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8351.785s">And</a>  hopefully the new council, whoever those Councilors might be, will realize that you do have an important role to play in this city and you're not going to be ostracized and you should be a game player for the future, just like the mayor is going to be a game player for the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8365.931s">You</a>  know, we're elected to do the people's business. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8367.832s">We're</a>  not elected here to be for ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8371.034s">There's</a>  no personal gain in here for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8372.995s">I'll</a>  speak for myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8374.509s">I</a>  love this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8375.189s">I've</a>  spent a lot of time in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8377.05s">I've</a>  been elected for a lot of years, and I'm very thankful to the taxpayers for that and the rate payers and the citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8383.033s">But</a>  you know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8383.934s">This</a>  is a new day dawn. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8385.335s">We're</a>  moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8386.235s">We're</a>  going into a new direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8388.036s">And</a>  that's hopefully, I hope the taxpayers buy into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8390.917s">Collaboration</a>  breeds success. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8392.378s">Yes,</a>  it's collaboration. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8393.299s">You're</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8393.679s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8396.62s">Councilor</a>  Motz. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8397.601s">If</a>  I could, just briefly, Mr. President, just because we're talking about the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8403.323s">I</a>  had some paperwork at my desk. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8404.804s">It</a>  says the two main charter change routes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8408.527s">Option</a>  one, electing a home rule charter commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8412.049s">It</a>  says option one is an election of a home rule charter commission, which leads to what is often referred to as a home rule charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8419.473s">A</a>  commission of nine members may be elected to frame a charter or revise its present charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8424.937s">For</a>  a city or a town upon a petition of 15% of the municipality's voters, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8430.942s">Chapter</a>  43B of the general laws provides a specific framework, timeline, and set of responsibilities for the charter commission to fulfill. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8439.324s">The</a>  commission has a maximum of 16 months to produce a preliminary report and a maximum of 18 months to produce a final report. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8447.465s">The</a>  statute requires that two public hearings be held. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8450.966s">Both</a>  the preliminary and the final reports must be printed and distributed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8456.887s">Option</a>  two is a home rule petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8459.532s">route,</a>  which leads to what is often referred to as a special act charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8464.133s">Section</a>  eight of the home rule petition amendment provides that cities and towns may use a home rule petition to achieve change in the structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8471.515s">The</a>  petition route was the only route available for cities and towns to make structural change prior to the passage of the amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8478.817s">Section</a>  eight does not provide detailed instructions regarding the preparation of a home rule petition charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8484.559s">A</a>  mayor or board of selectmen may appoint a study committee <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8488.253s">or</a>  such committees may be created by a city council or by a vote of a town meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8493.456s">Such</a>  actions may set a timeline for such committees to report back to the appointing a body, but there is no statement requirement for a specific timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8503.162s">There's</a>  also no requirement for printing and distribution of any proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8506.944s">There</a>  are no public hearing requirements per se, although some study committees do provide a public forum for discussion of its recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8514.729s">In</a>  a town meeting or city council meetings, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8517.201s">which</a>  such changes would be considered public meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8520.283s">In</a>  recent years, however, some study committees have used the CityTown website as publicized their recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8527.247s">And</a>  then it goes on to say after completing their work and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8530.389s">Then</a>  it also, Mr. President, just if I could, and I assume we're going to get this back from the city solicitor, it says periodic review of a charter by a charter review committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8542.315s">Once</a>  a community has a charter, there's often a provision <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8545.463s">for</a>  the periodic appointment of a charter review committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8548.425s">The</a>  committee undertakes an examination to determine the charter's ongoing utility and accuracy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8553.629s">Such</a>  committees do not have the powers, duties, and responsibilities of an elected charter commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8559.574s">Such</a>  committees are formed to review the charter and to make recommendations to its appointing body, example, Selectman City Council, regarding the need for additions, deletions, clarifications, or other amendments that would improve the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8574.036s">The</a>  term of such an advisory committee is usually one year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8577.098s">Recommendations</a>  of the committee may take the form of a proposal, special act, or proposed charter amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8583.422s">But</a>  the local legislative body must act upon the recommendations before they take effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8589.006s">The</a>  committee may also find, for example, that the charter's intent is clear, but related bylaws or ordinances may need clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8597.311s">The</a>  role of such committees can be important in ensuring that the charter is working as intended <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8602.622s">but</a>  the charter review committee has no assigned role in achieving any change beyond recommendation to the appointing body. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8609.326s">And</a>  if I recall, uh, the discussion we had, um, the periodic review of the city charter by this creation, Mr. President of this charter review committee was the most expedient way of getting a community body to make recommendations to the council and the council having a public hearing and discussing and debating all the issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8632.128s">And</a>  we could discuss this further, but I think that outlines the process that we, as a body, have. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8638.613s">And</a>  we do have, you know, this information at our fingertips. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8642.715s">And</a>  I look forward to more dialogue and discussion on this, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8650.06s">Councilor,</a>  do you happen to have a site on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8652.722s">For</a>  which one? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8654.143s">The</a>  document you just read off of. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8655.984s">Is</a>  there a website or some certain?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8661.662s">The</a>  first option refers to Chapter 43B of the Mass General Laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8666.465s">The</a>  second one refers to Section 8, which I assume is part of that 43B. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8677.511s">It</a>  doesn't give a chapter, but it gives a section. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8679.993s">And</a>  the periodic review is somewhere mixed in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8682.314s">There's</a>  no site to that.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8683.715s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8684.055s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8684.555s">I</a>  appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8687.817s">All</a>  set, Councilor Marks? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8688.757s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8689.158s">Yes,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8690.673s">Councilor</a>  Penta.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8692.514s">Mr.</a>  President, um, I'm going to apologize to you because, um, I think we've seen it and heard enough here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8700.739s">I</a>  understand when you come out, you know what I'm going to ask you to do if you don't mind, would you just withdraw your motion and put it legitimately on the agenda for next week? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8707.903s">And</a>  then that way there it's open and notorious and then everybody can discuss it because I think it can accomplish the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8714.147s">And</a>  at the same time, it's just such an important issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8718.317s">to</a>  have it come under suspension of the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8719.978s">I</a>  just think, can I, can I explain why I did what I did?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8726.161s">I</a>  put it in so we can get an opinion back from the solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8732.045s">So</a>  therefore we could have a point of discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8736.027s">That's</a>  an authoritative document before us.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8739.069s">And</a>  I appreciate that.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8739.949s">Never</a>  my intention Councilor to, uh, eliminate limit, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8747.445s">uh,</a>  prevent or obstruct or obscure discussion on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8753.208s">It</a>  was a beginning to get an opinion on how we go about this from the legal advisor to this council so we can begin the next steps.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8762.373s">And</a>  I can appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8763.293s">But</a>  at the same time, it's such, it's, it's, it's the thing that makes this city run. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8767.475s">It's,</a>  it's charter and you know, and if it was on the agenda, there'd be no, I'd have no problem with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8772.057s">I'm</a>  just, you know, it just reflects me back to the 43 vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8776.28s">You</a>  have to understand, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8777.639s">You're</a>  in one position and I'm in another. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8779.52s">But</a>  I think we're on the same page as far as getting an opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8782.501s">So</a>  that's what I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8784.001s">If</a>  you don't mind withdrawing it and just putting it on the agenda for next week, I would be more than happy with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8788.243s">That</a>  would be OK.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8791.985s">I</a>  see no reason why I'm asking for an opinion and still having a discussion once we get there.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8797.527s">Well,</a>  because there are other people who were actively involved that might want to come and speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8801.488s">And</a>  I want them to have an opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8803.389s">Under</a>  suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8805.53s">Under</a>  suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8807.204s">It's</a>  not on the agenda, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8808.505s">I</a>  understand that.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8809.766s">I</a>  understand that because it came to mind over the long weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8814.349s">And</a>  I wanted to just get a legal opinion.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8816.911s">But</a>  at the same time, but at the same time, Freddy, if I lay it on the table and it wins, it sits there for another week. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8822.175s">But</a>  if it's on the agenda next week, it doesn't make any difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8825.557s">At</a>  least it's open. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8826.498s">People</a>  can see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8827.298s">I'll</a>  withdraw it and place it on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8829.84s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8831.001s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8831.601s">I</a>  appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8832.602s">Motion</a>  is withdrawn.</p>
