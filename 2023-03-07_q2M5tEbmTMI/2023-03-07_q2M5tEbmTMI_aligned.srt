1
00:00:01,113 --> 00:00:03,574
It was one of the biggest crimes committed in the century.

2
00:00:04,714 --> 00:00:08,595
A crooked cop pulls off a bank job worth over $10 million.

3
00:00:09,635 --> 00:00:14,396
He was talented, well-organized, and incredibly intelligent.

4
00:00:14,776 --> 00:00:18,357
He committed the perfect crime, then mocked authorities.

5
00:00:18,937 --> 00:00:20,597
It's hard to describe the arrogance.

6
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:23,138
He just figured he was untouchable.

7
00:00:23,678 --> 00:00:27,119
Find out how he did it, next on Masterminds.

8
00:00:46,107 --> 00:00:47,488
Nobody should die that way.

9
00:00:47,528 --> 00:00:49,090
I've never seen anything that horrific.

10
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,634
One of the duties of a pathologist is to determine the cause of death.

11
00:01:07,142 --> 00:01:08,543
Medford, Massachusetts.

12
00:01:09,404 --> 00:01:12,987
In the early 80s, this quiet suburb of Boston was booming.

13
00:01:13,447 --> 00:01:17,230
People had jobs, people had money, people were spending money, people were making money.

14
00:01:20,192 --> 00:01:23,054
There was a lot of money around, and there was a lot of money in the bank.

15
00:01:23,835 --> 00:01:26,917
And the richest bank in Medford was Depositors Trust.

16
00:01:27,718 --> 00:01:30,080
Its security system was state-of-the-art.

17
00:01:31,497 --> 00:01:34,759
The alarm is wired into both the alarm company and the police station.

18
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,822
The vault has 18 inches of reinforced concrete.

19
00:01:39,462 --> 00:01:41,723
There were massive time-locked steel doors.

20
00:01:42,424 --> 00:01:46,366
Inside was a safe and a thousand double-key deposit boxes.

21
00:01:47,227 --> 00:01:49,068
The vault seemed impregnable.

22
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:54,291
But on Memorial Day weekend, 1980, the unthinkable happened.

23
00:01:54,932 --> 00:01:59,835
Depositors' Trust became the scene of the largest bank burglary in New England's history.

24
00:02:00,336 --> 00:02:09,061
Come that Tuesday morning, the bank opened, and they opened up and said, oh my God, what happened here?

25
00:02:09,081 --> 00:02:11,222
10 million in cash and jewels was gone.

26
00:02:11,242 --> 00:02:15,504
1,000 armor-plated deposit boxes had been smashed open.

27
00:02:16,305 --> 00:02:20,027
The highly sophisticated silent alarm hadn't gone off.

28
00:02:20,867 --> 00:02:24,670
And the reinforced concrete ceiling had a hole blown through it.

29
00:02:26,839 --> 00:02:28,340
It was incredibly bizarre.

30
00:02:29,161 --> 00:02:31,323
This is the type of job you see in Hollywood.

31
00:02:31,703 --> 00:02:33,345
That's the type of crime this was.

32
00:02:34,346 --> 00:02:37,929
The FBI was immediately notified and had jurisdiction over the crime scene.

33
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:40,291
They did an extensive investigation.

34
00:02:41,152 --> 00:02:45,296
There were no witnesses, no fingerprints, and no burglary tools.

35
00:02:46,497 --> 00:02:50,080
Well, there was no evidence because they had been so careful about covering their tracks.

36
00:02:51,578 --> 00:02:55,161
They had made sure that anything that went into the bank came out with them.

37
00:02:55,822 --> 00:02:57,363
In that sense, it was the perfect crime.

38
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,306
It's an immediate big story.

39
00:03:00,506 --> 00:03:02,468
And it's not just a big story at the Medford level.

40
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:06,051
It's a big story at the state level and at the federal level.

41
00:03:07,373 --> 00:03:10,956
The question then arose as to who were the suspects and who could have possibly

42
00:03:11,704 --> 00:03:19,026
perpetrated a job of this magnitude, but there was really no prime suspects at that point, other than the fact that it had to be a bunch of professionals.

43
00:03:19,586 --> 00:03:32,310
The gang was led by a professional, a professional police officer, Captain Jerry Clemente, a career cop obsessed with money and power, had pulled off a multi-million dollar heist.

44
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,751
The question is, how did he do it?

45
00:03:45,248 --> 00:03:53,832
Police Captain Jerry Clemente is the mastermind behind a $10 million heist at the Medford, Massachusetts Depositors Trust.

46
00:03:55,593 --> 00:04:04,938
The burglary is the climax of years of corruption that started with his first night on the force when he was partnered with a veteran cop named Crusher.

47
00:04:05,358 --> 00:04:09,180
They were going through Medford and they saw this guy running down the street holding a stolen lawn chair.

48
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:13,392
To Jerry's surprise, Crusher knows the thief.

49
00:04:14,452 --> 00:04:15,513
He turned out to be another cop.

50
00:04:16,693 --> 00:04:18,574
Guy picks up the lawn chair, goes away.

51
00:04:18,914 --> 00:04:20,675
Crusher says to Jerry, two things, Jerry.

52
00:04:20,955 --> 00:04:26,538
Number one, if you see a cop with a television, a piece of furniture, anything at all, mind your own business.

53
00:04:26,978 --> 00:04:28,399
Whatever he's doing is his business.

54
00:04:28,899 --> 00:04:30,740
Number two, don't play high and mighty.

55
00:04:31,341 --> 00:04:33,282
The lesson he learned was corruption was accepted.

56
00:04:34,002 --> 00:04:39,665
It was easy to move beyond that almost imperceptibly to a point where you were doing wholesale corrupt activities.

57
00:04:40,265 --> 00:04:44,708
Jerry quickly discovers he has a talent for planning and executing burglaries.

58
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:48,310
He furnishes his entire house with stolen goods.

59
00:04:49,591 --> 00:04:51,232
But he's also a brave cop.

60
00:04:52,012 --> 00:04:58,556
Early in his career, Clemente is awarded a Medal of Valor for his role in the takedown of an armed gangster.

61
00:05:00,017 --> 00:05:02,939
He had a good reputation in law enforcement circles.

62
00:05:03,059 --> 00:05:07,602
You know, he was a good guy, solid guy, you know, a go-to guy.

63
00:05:08,732 --> 00:05:13,816
But his double life as criminal and crime fighter soon spills over into his personal affairs.

64
00:05:15,297 --> 00:05:24,663
Here's a married man with a family living, you know, a happily married life in a community on the surface, who at the same time is having a clandestine sexual affair.

65
00:05:25,604 --> 00:05:31,048
So it certainly must have been part of Jerry's makeup to want to lead a double life.

66
00:05:31,809 --> 00:05:37,535
As Clemente moves up through the ranks of law enforcement, he's drawn to more ambitious crimes.

67
00:05:38,116 --> 00:05:40,358
He partners with Sergeant Tom Doherty.

68
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:42,100
Tom Doherty was always a rogue.

69
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:48,086
He was arrogant, out of control, and basically abused his badge.

70
00:05:49,107 --> 00:05:51,590
from probably the first day you wore it.

71
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:55,293
In 1978, Clemente and Doherty pulled their first big job.

72
00:05:55,653 --> 00:05:56,234
The target?

73
00:05:56,594 --> 00:05:57,655
The police department.

74
00:05:57,975 --> 00:06:07,104
They would steal the police promotional exam before it was given, make copies of it, sell it for $5,000 to somebody who wanted to be a police chief someplace.

75
00:06:08,044 --> 00:06:13,810
They manipulated and controlled who they wanted in command positions in the city and town police departments.

76
00:06:15,047 --> 00:06:18,069
They were very powerful back at that time, very powerful.

77
00:06:18,609 --> 00:06:21,591
And Jerry Clemente was at the top of it.

78
00:06:21,871 --> 00:06:26,854
Then in 1980, Clemente and Doherty see an opportunity to become multi-millionaires.

79
00:06:27,515 --> 00:06:30,156
They decide to hit depositors' trust.

80
00:06:30,717 --> 00:06:33,718
They both knew in the back of their minds that this was the big score.

81
00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:39,102
This was, of all the planned criminal activities that they were involved in, this was the one that was going to set them up for life.

82
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:47,216
Because Tommy had his own safety deposit box in the bank, he was able to go in and case the place.

83
00:06:47,956 --> 00:06:55,322
While he was in there, he mentally paced off the dimensions of the vault, noted where the safes were, where the deposit boxes were.

84
00:06:56,296 --> 00:07:01,497
Based on this information, Clemente knows he needs a specialized team to pull off the job.

85
00:07:02,138 --> 00:07:07,239
He recruits fellow crooked cop Joe Banks and a gangster known as Brother O'Leary.

86
00:07:07,799 --> 00:07:11,960
They're going to have to bypass the alarm, so they need an alarm guy, and that was Bucky Barrett.

87
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:18,322
Bucky Barrett was, by all accounts, an expert at alarms and was, by all accounts, a professional burglar.

88
00:07:19,846 --> 00:07:26,575
The alarm was a major obstacle that the gang had to get over because it was wired in to both the Medford police station and to the alarm company.

89
00:07:26,815 --> 00:07:27,837
And it was a silent alarm.

90
00:07:28,257 --> 00:07:31,661
So if you triggered it at the bank, you wouldn't know that it had gone off.

91
00:07:32,507 --> 00:07:37,070
Bucky realizes he'll have to bypass the alarm using sophisticated electronics.

92
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:40,512
He assembles a device to block the outgoing signal.

93
00:07:40,952 --> 00:07:46,736
For two months, Clemente and Bucky Barrett return to the bank each night to test every wire.

94
00:07:47,016 --> 00:07:53,160
He had to test each wire individually to figure out which was the alarm wire so he could set up the bypass box and disable the alarm.

95
00:07:54,521 --> 00:07:56,843
Jerry also makes reconnaissance patrols.

96
00:07:57,836 --> 00:08:04,782
They made dry runs, staked out the bank, much the way police officers would stake out an alleged scene of a crime.

97
00:08:04,882 --> 00:08:07,985
I mean, they staked out their scene of the crime.

98
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:15,612
Confident it's a go, Clemente now sets a date for the heist, the Memorial Day weekend.

99
00:08:17,253 --> 00:08:22,378
During Memorial Day weekend in 1980, there were a number of public events going on, including a carnival.

100
00:08:23,118 --> 00:08:26,261
A lot of noise, a lot of commotion into the late night hours.

101
00:08:26,581 --> 00:08:29,704
That really worked very well for the conspirators.

102
00:08:30,304 --> 00:08:32,566
The team now makes final preparations.

103
00:08:33,594 --> 00:08:42,041
They had acetylene torches, they had dynamite, they had special magnesium burning rods, carbide core bits for the drills.

104
00:08:42,661 --> 00:08:47,605
Everything that they needed for any eventuality, they had prepared carefully ahead of time.

105
00:08:48,306 --> 00:08:51,008
The night of the burglary, the gang moves into position.

106
00:08:51,629 --> 00:09:00,516
Clemente is confident he won't be discovered because his lookout man is the senior cop on duty for the entire city of Medford, Tommy Doherty.

107
00:09:01,258 --> 00:09:05,060
If anybody did come along, he'd be able to make sure they moved on.

108
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:10,262
Or if they came too close, he could tell them to go away because he was, after all, a police officer.

109
00:09:11,042 --> 00:09:14,664
With everything in place, Clemente sets his plan in motion.

110
00:09:15,584 --> 00:09:20,967
The steps of the burglary began with them bypassing the alarm system at the rear of the building.

111
00:09:22,247 --> 00:09:26,409
After that was accomplished, Jerry Clemente picked the lock to the shop next door.

112
00:09:27,824 --> 00:09:31,128
which gave them access to the upper loft area.

113
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:36,555
Inside the shop's attic, they break through the wall leading to the bank.

114
00:09:37,196 --> 00:09:38,618
That wall was made of cinder blocks.

115
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:42,511
So in a matter of minutes, they had smashed through there.

116
00:09:42,731 --> 00:09:45,631
They were able to crawl into the crawl space above the vault.

117
00:09:46,811 --> 00:09:50,112
So they then could start the tunnels through the actual ceiling of the vault.

118
00:09:50,712 --> 00:09:54,853
Using power from a nearby fuse box, they start to drill through the vault ceiling.

119
00:09:55,113 --> 00:09:59,874
And they knew exactly where to drill in order to create the hole, from Tommy having mentally cased the place.

120
00:10:01,054 --> 00:10:03,895
You know, the old story, plan your work, work your plan.

121
00:10:04,945 --> 00:10:09,528
Everything was done exact to a T. They knew what they had to do.

122
00:10:10,148 --> 00:10:11,609
They were all disciplined guys.

123
00:10:12,269 --> 00:10:16,311
At each step of the way, they would pause and wait, report back to Tommy.

124
00:10:17,272 --> 00:10:20,954
Tommy would make sure that nobody had heard anything, that nothing was being reported.

125
00:10:21,174 --> 00:10:22,214
He'd have a good look around.

126
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:25,336
Then he'd give them the okay to go on to the next stage of the operation.

127
00:10:27,657 --> 00:10:30,159
But an hour into the job, there's a big problem.

128
00:10:31,003 --> 00:10:34,745
Doherty radios Clemente to shut everything down and keep quiet.

129
00:10:35,545 --> 00:10:39,547
The owners of Brigham's restaurant next to the bank have come to take inventory.

130
00:10:40,087 --> 00:10:42,428
Clemente has Doherty spring into action.

131
00:10:43,029 --> 00:10:48,311
Tommy went in, told these people, I'm sorry, we've had some criminal activity around here lately.

132
00:10:48,491 --> 00:10:52,233
We really can't have you doing inventory in the middle of the night, and got them to leave and go home.

133
00:10:52,953 --> 00:10:56,975
And they were quite impressed that, geez, great police response here.

134
00:10:57,756 --> 00:11:00,197
Doherty gives Clemente the all clear.

135
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:07,691
Above the vault, the men resume working on the 18 inches of steel-reinforced concrete.

136
00:11:08,371 --> 00:11:12,272
Clemente has brought dynamite, but he knows he's taking a risk.

137
00:11:13,452 --> 00:11:19,874
The risk obviously being they're in the middle of a downtown area in Medford, that that would be heard by the neighbors and that they would be discovered.

138
00:11:21,274 --> 00:11:26,695
They pile sandbags on the dynamite to direct the blast downward and muffle the sound.

139
00:11:32,843 --> 00:11:35,285
As it happens, nobody reported any sound.

140
00:11:35,685 --> 00:11:39,988
It's possible that people heard a loud bang, but maybe they thought it was revelry from the carnival.

141
00:11:40,588 --> 00:11:46,853
The explosives were able to dislodge the concrete, but it still left the wire mesh that had to be cut with an acetylene torch.

142
00:11:49,074 --> 00:11:52,617
It's hot, time-consuming work, but by 3 a.m.

143
00:11:52,677 --> 00:11:54,278
they break through the vault ceiling.

144
00:11:56,833 --> 00:12:02,015
So when they dropped down into the vault, they had all of this debris all over the place and all of this dust floating in the air.

145
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:04,375
Their main target is the safe.

146
00:12:04,915 --> 00:12:09,637
At the rear of the vault was a larger safe, which the bank used for their cash for their customers.

147
00:12:10,417 --> 00:12:12,838
Bucky sets to work with an acetylene torch.

148
00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:18,620
O'Leary and Bang start prying open the safety deposit boxes.

149
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,941
It takes an hour to cut through the safe's hinges.

150
00:12:25,142 --> 00:12:26,062
Bucky opens the safe.

151
00:12:28,606 --> 00:12:29,766
There's only 60 grand.

152
00:12:30,086 --> 00:12:31,507
They're all incredibly disappointed.

153
00:12:31,987 --> 00:12:39,050
Months of preparation, careful planning, high risk, incredible expectations, and they're sitting there with $60,000.

154
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:49,233
Unfortunately, they found a very small amount of cash, principally because it was Memorial Day weekend and most of the cash had already been removed by the bank employees and sent to the Federal Reserve for the weekend.

155
00:12:50,927 --> 00:12:52,647
There's nothing more Jerry can do.

156
00:12:53,308 --> 00:12:54,308
They've run out of time.

157
00:12:55,248 --> 00:12:59,529
It's in May, so there's an early dawn, and they got to be out of there before it gets light.

158
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:04,670
It's not turning out exactly the way that they thought it would, so they'll go back to Joe's house.

159
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:12,092
So Jerry says, well, we've got two more nights to come back in and to go through and break open as many of these safety deposit boxes as we can.

160
00:13:13,635 --> 00:13:18,242
Had this been your typical burglars, they would never have risked going back the second or third night.

161
00:13:18,643 --> 00:13:29,059
But Jerry Clemente knew that with three active police officers involved in this conspiracy, they had an absolute control over preventing anyone from law enforcement ever detecting that they were inside that vault.

162
00:13:29,807 --> 00:13:33,028
Back in the vault, they set to work on the safety deposit boxes.

163
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:37,850
But the problem is, it's taking 15 minutes to open each one.

164
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:47,214
Initially, they were breaking through these cylinder locks by manually using a screwdriver and breaking out these cylinder locks.

165
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,135
They found that took an annoying amount of time.

166
00:13:50,304 --> 00:13:56,647
So then he discovered this new method, which was basically to use the chisel and hammer to break off the hinges.

167
00:13:56,667 --> 00:14:01,389
It was much faster and enabled him to open more doors in a quicker way.

168
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:08,953
Over the next two nights, the gang uses this new method to break into 1,000 deposit boxes and empty the vault.

169
00:14:09,313 --> 00:14:18,598
So there was close to $2 million in cash, but there was also pink diamonds, rare jewels, ordinary diamonds, expensive watches.

170
00:14:19,923 --> 00:14:27,569
They were lugging so much stuff out of there, they were exhausted, and they were doing it under the protection of the police.

171
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:29,871
It's frightening.

172
00:14:32,853 --> 00:14:37,096
They were the police.

173
00:14:37,116 --> 00:14:44,162
72 hours after breaking into the vault, Clemente and his crew escape with $10 million in cash and jewels.

174
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,773
Well, the first thing they did is they split the cash six ways.

175
00:14:49,173 --> 00:14:53,078
So they all got their take of the cash, which was about 200 grand apiece.

176
00:14:53,757 --> 00:14:56,879
But dividing the jewelry is much more difficult.

177
00:14:57,379 --> 00:15:03,523
Problem was is then jewelry is identifiable, and they had a problem of how could they get rid of it and convert that into cash.

178
00:15:03,864 --> 00:15:06,245
Clemente decides to leave it with Joe Banks.

179
00:15:06,645 --> 00:15:10,728
Now all he has to do is wait, and he and his crew will be very rich.

180
00:15:11,148 --> 00:15:16,452
But this treasure will set one gang member against another and threatens to destroy them all.

181
00:15:28,216 --> 00:15:30,761
Jerry Clemente and his crew of crooked cops.

182
00:15:33,576 --> 00:15:39,782
have pulled off a brilliantly planned bank burglary, netting more than 10 million in cash and jewels.

183
00:15:40,202 --> 00:15:51,293
When the bank manager came in on Tuesday morning, he found, on the floor of the vault, papers in empty boxes between knee-deep and four feet high.

184
00:15:52,114 --> 00:15:57,920
One of the people who came to protect the scene until the FBI arrived was Sergeant Thomas Dougherty.

185
00:15:59,047 --> 00:16:03,070
The robberies lookout man is now a spy inside the investigation.

186
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:06,733
Daugherty keeps Clemente informed of FBI progress.

187
00:16:07,213 --> 00:16:09,935
The speculation was there had to be an insider involved.

188
00:16:09,955 --> 00:16:11,796
There had to be someone with local knowledge.

189
00:16:12,217 --> 00:16:15,499
A number of people were interviewed, including Tom Daugherty, Jerry Clemente.

190
00:16:15,719 --> 00:16:17,801
Both of them were on duty during part of that weekend.

191
00:16:18,801 --> 00:16:27,508
But while there was a lot of speculation and rumor that Jerry Clemente was, in fact, a mastermind, there was no physical evidence connecting him to the burglary.

192
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:34,143
When investigators try to shake Clemente's alibi, his mistress, Barbara Hickey, backs him up.

193
00:16:35,084 --> 00:16:42,611
He instructed her that if she were asked where he was on those nights, that she was to say that he was with her for the entire night.

194
00:16:43,701 --> 00:16:45,963
Knowing authorities have nothing concrete.

195
00:16:46,363 --> 00:16:47,805
Clemente Stonewalls.

196
00:16:48,505 --> 00:16:53,510
The fact that Jerry is a captain in the police department means that he understands police procedure.

197
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:56,132
He understands the rules of evidence.

198
00:16:56,472 --> 00:17:00,276
He knows what it is that they need in order to prove that he did it.

199
00:17:00,616 --> 00:17:02,858
He also knows that they can't put it together.

200
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:10,625
So he feels that even though they have strong suspicions, and even though they can make life difficult for him, that he's in the clear.

201
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,201
The FBI continues to investigate.

202
00:17:14,721 --> 00:17:20,404
They put Clemente under 24-hour surveillance, but Clemente knows he's being watched.

203
00:17:22,085 --> 00:17:24,806
Without knowing the guy, it's hard to describe the arrogance.

204
00:17:25,206 --> 00:17:28,508
He just figured he was untouchable.

205
00:17:28,528 --> 00:17:31,929
They had thrown everything they had at him, and he walked away.

206
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:40,113
As the case against him grows cold, Clemente lies low, waiting for the statute of limitations to run out.

207
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:47,858
Jerry's very conscious that at this stage, they have less than a year to go, and they're home and dry in the depositors' trust heist.

208
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:49,300
The clock was ticking.

209
00:17:50,461 --> 00:17:56,468
And honestly, unless something happened, this was going to be an unsolved crime.

210
00:17:57,050 --> 00:18:02,693
But just as police are about to abandon the investigation, Clemente is hit with a crisis.

211
00:18:03,393 --> 00:18:06,774
Tommy Doherty and Joe Bang start spinning out of control.

212
00:18:07,054 --> 00:18:08,695
They're both using cocaine heavily.

213
00:18:08,935 --> 00:18:10,496
They're both incredibly paranoid.

214
00:18:11,016 --> 00:18:18,800
And soon, the friction between them with the free base and being paranoid, and they also started to think one of them might be dropping a dime on the other.

215
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,281
And that's when the whole ball started rolling down the hill.

216
00:18:24,442 --> 00:18:25,643
All of a sudden, guns are out.

217
00:18:26,925 --> 00:18:27,946
Joe Bangs gets shot.

218
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:32,952
It's the worst thing that could have happened.

219
00:18:33,352 --> 00:18:34,534
One, that Tommy shot him.

220
00:18:34,574 --> 00:18:39,119
Two, that he didn't kill him, because it just brought total chaos to their whole operation.

221
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:43,083
The state cops arrive to investigate the shooting.

222
00:18:43,604 --> 00:18:46,166
They find drugs and jewelry in Joe Bangs' car.

223
00:18:47,324 --> 00:18:52,886
That jewelry allowed a clear link to be made between Joe and the depositors' trust heist.

224
00:18:53,306 --> 00:18:56,247
And it allowed the police to put pressure on Joe.

225
00:18:56,807 --> 00:19:04,729
With police leaning on one gang member and another in jail, Jerry Clemente is facing the greatest threat of his criminal career.

226
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,150
So his life is basically turned upside down.

227
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:12,452
But he knew that if he just kept his cool, and that if the others kept their cool, that they couldn't be broken.

228
00:19:13,677 --> 00:19:19,341
With the discovery of the stolen jewelry, police are determined to bring down Clemente and his gang.

229
00:19:20,902 --> 00:19:22,824
Adrenaline gets fired up a little more.

230
00:19:23,324 --> 00:19:25,786
It's one of the biggest crimes committed in the century.

231
00:19:25,886 --> 00:19:27,127
I mean, these are bad cops.

232
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:28,728
If you're a bad cop, you want to get them.

233
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:35,913
While authorities build their case against Clemente, Tommy Doherty goes on trial for the shooting of Joe Bangs.

234
00:19:36,734 --> 00:19:40,357
Doherty's lawyer presses Bangs about the jewelry found in his car.

235
00:19:41,352 --> 00:19:45,494
Isn't it true, Mr. Bangs, that you had a kilo of cocaine in the trunk of your car?

236
00:19:46,655 --> 00:19:47,115
Yes, it is.

237
00:19:48,055 --> 00:19:51,757
And isn't it true that you had some jewelry in the trunk of your car?

238
00:19:52,878 --> 00:19:53,358
Yes, it is.

239
00:19:53,378 --> 00:19:56,280
And I suppose that jewelry was stolen, too.

240
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,601
Bangs responded.

241
00:19:58,741 --> 00:19:59,821
He finally had had it.

242
00:19:59,981 --> 00:20:03,883
He goes, yes, sir, it was stolen jewelry.

243
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:08,025
I stole it with your defendant on Memorial Day weekend, 1980.

244
00:20:09,502 --> 00:20:11,804
and the whole court went into an uproar.

245
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:14,347
It was the biggest break that came along on it.

246
00:20:14,927 --> 00:20:20,933
Doherty is found guilty, and Joe Bangs tells prosecutors everything about the depositors' trust heist.

247
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:22,815
But police need more.

248
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:26,438
Joe Bangs carried a lot of baggage and had very low credibility.

249
00:20:26,578 --> 00:20:32,304
The problem we faced was that a jury would say, you're only saying this and implicating others because you want to save your own skin.

250
00:20:33,356 --> 00:20:38,739
Investigators then get a break when they learn Clemente has left his mistress, Barbara Hickey.

251
00:20:39,859 --> 00:20:44,341
They were working with her and working with her and working with her, and they were getting nowhere with her, none at all.

252
00:20:45,021 --> 00:20:56,667
And so they were kind of throwing up their hands and going, turning to leave when she said to him, well, I don't know if this helps, but would it make any difference that he came home one night that weekend loaded with dust and dirt all over him?

253
00:20:56,687 --> 00:21:01,349
Does that make cement powder and that type of thing, would that be helpful to you?

254
00:21:02,439 --> 00:21:08,563
For Jerry Clemente, Barbara Hickey's turning on the gang is the worst thing that could possibly happen.

255
00:21:08,923 --> 00:21:10,965
It brings down the whole gang.

256
00:21:12,446 --> 00:21:13,227
house of cards.

257
00:21:13,887 --> 00:21:20,033
Jerry Clemente is arrested and charged with four counts of breaking and entering with intent to commit a felony.

258
00:21:20,574 --> 00:21:27,460
Although the evidence against him is strong, he's unconcerned, continuing to believe he's pulled off the perfect heist.

259
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,942
Jerry was always super confident.

260
00:21:30,843 --> 00:21:35,748
He always had faith in his ability to get out of any situation that he might find himself in.

261
00:21:39,098 --> 00:21:46,761
He knew how to cover his tracks, he knew how to make sure that the right people were involved, and he knew how to make sure that when it came down to it, the odds were stacked in his favor.

262
00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:49,102
He was an intelligent, articulate guy.

263
00:21:49,623 --> 00:21:59,787
He had spent a lot of time planning and preparing for this burglary, and yet, I think, to the end, never believed that the government would be able to prove and have a jury believe and convict him of the crime.

264
00:22:00,607 --> 00:22:06,470
But at his trial, his former mistress, Barbara Hickey, is the prosecution's star witness.

265
00:22:06,995 --> 00:22:16,599
Out of a clear blue sky, he said that he was going to have a lot of money, and he would never have to work a day in his life again.

266
00:22:17,219 --> 00:22:20,981
Her testimony finally puts the corrupt cop behind bars.

267
00:22:21,521 --> 00:22:26,163
Jarrett got 30 to 40 years, so it was the maximum sentence, and they nailed it.

268
00:22:26,503 --> 00:22:35,307
It's particularly satisfying when it's a police officer, and you realize that this is someone who had corrupted the system, who had breached his trust, and who should be brought to justice.

269
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:39,583
After 10 years in jail, Jerry Clemente is paroled.

270
00:22:40,544 --> 00:22:44,908
He is currently without a job and is fighting for his police pension.

271
00:22:47,397 --> 00:22:51,138
One man masterminds the largest gold mining scam in history.

272
00:22:51,878 --> 00:22:55,059
Surely one of the biggest frauds in the history of the world.

273
00:22:55,339 --> 00:22:57,719
Probably the biggest mining fraud of all time.

274
00:22:58,199 --> 00:23:02,660
He outwitted scientists, analysts, and the world's leading investors.

275
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:06,401
There was always some science backing up this fraud.

276
00:23:06,681 --> 00:23:12,102
He turned a penny stock into a billion dollar scam and made himself millions.

277
00:23:12,982 --> 00:23:15,963
Find out how, next on Masterminds.

278
00:23:37,955 --> 00:23:48,523
On December 13th, 1993, a lone prospector entered the darkest jungles of Borneo and discovered the biggest gold strike of the 20th century.

279
00:23:50,064 --> 00:23:57,390
These series of jungle hills in Indonesia, which all have been formed by a volcano, were lying on top of a pool of gold.

280
00:23:59,551 --> 00:24:04,575
The prospector staked a claim on behalf of a small mining company named Briax.

281
00:24:05,637 --> 00:24:08,418
He ordered rock samples drilled and sent for testing.

282
00:24:09,098 --> 00:24:14,741
There was some interesting core results, and it seemed like this could be one of those junior plays that made people a lot of money.

283
00:24:15,481 --> 00:24:20,403
Independent auditors assessed the size of the gold deposit as astronomical.

284
00:24:20,924 --> 00:24:26,106
And they started to realize that they had what they thought was an elephant deposit, a great big puddle of gold.

285
00:24:27,126 --> 00:24:29,207
Breac stock took off like a rocket.

286
00:24:30,067 --> 00:24:33,109
The prospector used the money to expand his operation.

287
00:24:33,909 --> 00:24:39,138
He cleared hundreds of acres of jungle and brought in sophisticated excavation machinery.

288
00:24:40,987 --> 00:24:44,409
The analysts on Bay Street and Wall Street got caught up in the excitement.

289
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:51,994
And every time they published more details about this gold find in Indonesia, the market capitalization of the company, the size of the company would jump.

290
00:24:52,374 --> 00:24:55,556
This company went from $1 or $2 to $286.

291
00:24:55,776 --> 00:24:59,358
This was the largest gold deposit in the world.

292
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:05,282
Back in Indonesia, the prospector kept uncovering more and more gold.

293
00:25:05,842 --> 00:25:06,963
Gold was trading at $350 US an ounce.

294
00:25:07,043 --> 00:25:08,104
If you multiply it out,

295
00:25:10,657 --> 00:25:13,019
It's about 70 billion dollars U.S.

296
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:21,325
Fueled by greed, everyone from boardroom executives to middle class suburbanites wanted in on the action.

297
00:25:22,026 --> 00:25:25,949
Everybody wanted to be the suitor to walk down the aisle with reacts.

298
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:29,752
Even the corrupt Indonesian government tried to muscle in.

299
00:25:30,913 --> 00:25:35,677
But what no one knew was there was no gold, not one ounce.

300
00:25:37,164 --> 00:25:44,969
The lone prospector cashed in his company's stock options and made off with millions, leaving investors devastated.

301
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:49,873
People who have basically put a lot of their life savings into Brex lose everything.

302
00:25:50,493 --> 00:25:53,255
And I know of several individuals who committed suicide.

303
00:25:54,816 --> 00:26:01,921
The prospector had engineered an unparalleled gold rush, outsmarting scientists, analysts, and investors.

304
00:26:02,821 --> 00:26:04,623
His name was Michael de Guzman.

305
00:26:05,365 --> 00:26:07,888
The question is, how did he do it?

306
00:26:10,911 --> 00:26:22,204
Michael de Guzman has convinced the world to invest in a gold mine that isn't there, turning a penny stock into a billion-dollar venture and lining his pockets with millions.

307
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:31,420
Michael de Guzman was a Filipino geologist who worked in Indonesia.

308
00:26:32,621 --> 00:26:39,123
For years, de Guzman struggles for recognition in an industry dominated by large American mining companies.

309
00:26:40,044 --> 00:26:41,304
Mike de Guzman knew he was smart.

310
00:26:41,324 --> 00:26:42,425
He had fabulous marks.

311
00:26:42,465 --> 00:26:45,466
He had an engineering degree, but he never got a great job.

312
00:26:45,486 --> 00:26:47,007
He never got a crack at a great job.

313
00:26:47,067 --> 00:26:54,050
It's very difficult for the Filipinos, even with extremely good engineering training, to get senior jobs with the big mining companies.

314
00:26:55,268 --> 00:27:00,712
While exploring the jungles of Borneo, de Guzman devises a plan to make himself rich.

315
00:27:01,573 --> 00:27:06,576
Unable to get the support he needs to find a gold mine, he decides to invent one.

316
00:27:07,477 --> 00:27:10,840
Michael de Guzman was going to get the wealth that he could never aspire to otherwise.

317
00:27:11,411 --> 00:27:18,777
de Guzman reasons that the most convincing site for the world's largest gold mine is on the Indonesian island of Borneo.

318
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:23,320
In the area around Indonesia is an area which is quite unusually rich in gold.

319
00:27:23,721 --> 00:27:28,044
Gold mines are associated with volcanic activity quite a bit.

320
00:27:28,084 --> 00:27:30,646
So areas where you get volcanoes, people find gold mines.

321
00:27:32,728 --> 00:27:38,292
De Guzman concocts a geological theory to capitalize on what the experts already believe.

322
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:50,325
And the theory essentially was where there are extinct volcanoes, you're going to kind of have a plug of minerals like gold that are fairly close to the surface.

323
00:27:51,566 --> 00:27:56,208
Now de Guzman must find someone with credibility to sell his idea to the world.

324
00:27:56,908 --> 00:27:59,610
He targets geologist John Felderhoff.

325
00:28:01,238 --> 00:28:11,364
John Felderhoff is the very sort of person you would imagine that would be crazy enough to go through the jungles of Kalimantan or Borneo, wearing hip waders and looking for gold.

326
00:28:12,405 --> 00:28:17,388
He had actually a well-established reputation of having discovered a gold mine in Indonesia.

327
00:28:18,909 --> 00:28:25,373
De Guzman convinces Felderhoff to find a foreign investor who's willing to take risks and not ask questions.

328
00:28:26,214 --> 00:28:29,316
Felderhoff recommends a businessman from Western Canada.

329
00:28:31,075 --> 00:28:32,376
David Walsh was this promoter.

330
00:28:32,416 --> 00:28:33,276
He'd been bankrupt.

331
00:28:33,316 --> 00:28:35,017
He'd been sort of living out of the trunk of his car.

332
00:28:35,377 --> 00:28:37,678
He was the kind of guy who was always talking up a story.

333
00:28:38,979 --> 00:28:44,681
Walsh has flown to Indonesia, where he's wined and dined in the finest hotel in Jakarta.

334
00:28:45,422 --> 00:28:52,105
Walsh was at a point where he was looking for some promising properties, and he spent basically his last few bucks to take a trip to Indonesia.

335
00:28:54,295 --> 00:29:04,801
With nothing more than a few rocks, maps, and some questionable data, de Guzman sells Walsh on investing 80 grand on a property in Borneo that he's never even seen.

336
00:29:05,622 --> 00:29:07,283
It's called Busang.

337
00:29:09,044 --> 00:29:19,570
The thing that made the Briex fraud credible in everybody's eyes was that one of the largest gold mines in the world is in the Indonesian islands, about 70 miles away from what became Busang.

338
00:29:21,982 --> 00:29:28,565
In exchange for their work exploring Busan, de Guzman demands stock options for himself and Felderhoff.

339
00:29:30,426 --> 00:29:36,149
Now de Guzman sets out to turn this penny stock company into a corporation worth billions.

340
00:29:41,391 --> 00:29:46,414
He starts by hiring a young Filipino staff, over which he has total control.

341
00:29:49,591 --> 00:29:53,834
So the person really in charge on site in Busan was Michael de Guzman.

342
00:29:57,416 --> 00:30:00,178
De Guzman orders his team to drill core samples.

343
00:30:00,979 --> 00:30:04,041
Once extracted, the core sample is split in two.

344
00:30:04,801 --> 00:30:06,883
Typically, half is stored on site.

345
00:30:07,463 --> 00:30:13,447
The other half is then crushed and sent to a lab to be tested, determining how much gold is present.

346
00:30:17,262 --> 00:30:24,127
But because de Guzman knows the property has no gold, he employs an age-old mining trick called salting.

347
00:30:25,688 --> 00:30:27,929
Salting refers to adding gold to the ore.

348
00:30:28,509 --> 00:30:35,274
Usually what would happen is you'd have a gold mine and you'd go there and you'd take gold nuggets, sprinkle it around the way you'd sprinkle salt around.

349
00:30:36,327 --> 00:30:42,672
De Guzman orders the crushed rock moved to a locked shed where he's sure to have absolute privacy.

350
00:30:43,593 --> 00:30:52,941
Inside, he devises an ingenious method of salting the samples with gold filed from his wedding ring.

351
00:30:52,961 --> 00:30:57,685
Adding it to the ground up rock, as far as I know, that's not been done before.

352
00:30:57,705 --> 00:31:00,748
That was quite a, that was a novel twist.

353
00:31:02,092 --> 00:31:08,937
The challenge to Michael is then taking 40 pounds of rock, figuring out exactly how many gold flakes should go in there.

354
00:31:08,957 --> 00:31:12,099
In other words, there's three ounces of gold per ton of rock.

355
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:15,482
So he's got to do a fair amount of division, and he's got to carefully weigh out his gold.

356
00:31:16,002 --> 00:31:25,289
If he'd grabbed a teaspoonful and chucked it in, the gold gray would have been phenomenal, and he would have gone, and it would have attracted attention.

357
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,692
De Guzman's calculations are perfect.

358
00:31:29,784 --> 00:31:34,067
The lab results suggest high levels of gold without raising suspicion.

359
00:31:36,249 --> 00:31:43,455
De Guzman has his front man, John Felderhoff, call David Walsh at his home in Western Canada and tell him the good news.

360
00:31:44,335 --> 00:31:47,278
The lab results are the equivalent of a hot tip.

361
00:31:48,863 --> 00:31:50,865
The market came to really look forward to these results.

362
00:31:50,925 --> 00:31:52,146
You know, there'd be a big excitement.

363
00:31:53,106 --> 00:31:56,829
Walsh would say, on Tuesday, we should have core results for you.

364
00:31:57,229 --> 00:31:59,611
Tuesday would come, sure enough, there'd be 10 or 12 new holes.

365
00:32:00,272 --> 00:32:06,677
As each consecutive lab result is posted, it appears that more and more gold is being found in Busan.

366
00:32:09,699 --> 00:32:14,763
Investors rush to buy Bre-X shares listed on the Alberta Stock Exchange in Canada.

367
00:32:17,186 --> 00:32:24,768
There's so much drilling at Busang that de Guzman needs a larger supply of gold in order to keep salting the thousands of samples.

368
00:32:25,908 --> 00:32:32,790
There's a lot of local Indonesian natives who make their living, or at least a part of their living, by panning for gold in the rivers.

369
00:32:33,711 --> 00:32:37,092
Michael befriended this fellow and started buying gold off him.

370
00:32:37,132 --> 00:32:40,412
So over a period of about two years, Michael bought about $61,000 worth of gold off this guy.

371
00:32:44,249 --> 00:32:51,757
Meanwhile, investors anxious to get in on the deal send over an independent auditor to review all de Guzman's records.

372
00:32:52,697 --> 00:32:55,560
The auditor demands to see de Guzman's core samples.

373
00:32:57,863 --> 00:33:00,425
But de Guzman hasn't saved half the samples.

374
00:33:00,946 --> 00:33:06,851
They did split their core all right, but they only kept 10 centimeters out of every meter.

375
00:33:07,032 --> 00:33:08,313
That's very unusual.

376
00:33:11,608 --> 00:33:16,570
To prevent the auditor from becoming suspicious, de Guzman is ready with an explanation.

377
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:22,951
He cites a phenomenon called the nugget effect, in which the gold is distributed unevenly.

378
00:33:23,612 --> 00:33:27,993
De Guzman insists he must crush all of the sample in order to get an accurate reading.

379
00:33:29,974 --> 00:33:32,394
The key was crushing up all the coal.

380
00:33:33,175 --> 00:33:33,895
Nobody could check.

381
00:33:33,915 --> 00:33:37,656
Having crushed up all the coal, basically they destroyed the evidence.

382
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:45,334
But when the auditor takes a closer look at the samples, he's suspicious about the river gold purchased by de Guzman.

383
00:33:45,895 --> 00:33:51,977
The gold you get from penning in a river looks quite different from the gold that you find at the bottom of a gold mine.

384
00:33:52,317 --> 00:33:54,238
River gold gets rounded around the edges.

385
00:33:54,258 --> 00:33:57,919
The flakes of gold are shaped by the forces of the water and the weather.

386
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:07,943
De Guzman uses his theory of volcanic pools to explain why this kind of gold is precisely what you would expect at Busan.

387
00:34:09,962 --> 00:34:16,284
Within hours, the Bre-X website announces the successful audit, and the stock rises dramatically.

388
00:34:16,744 --> 00:34:18,724
You could watch this stock move.

389
00:34:18,864 --> 00:34:21,085
It would go from $20 to $30 in the space of three weeks.

390
00:34:22,005 --> 00:34:27,627
Building on his success with the auditor, de Guzman now moves to drive the stock price even higher.

391
00:34:29,627 --> 00:34:33,508
They looked at their maps, and they said, OK, well, if there's gold here, maybe there'll be gold over here as well.

392
00:34:33,548 --> 00:34:34,749
And that's when they got into Boozang II.

393
00:34:38,045 --> 00:34:46,228
De Guzman finds enough surface gold to convince David Walsh to finance drilling for what he claims is a second massive gold deposit.

394
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:54,191
Once again, De Guzman has Felderhoff fire off a message to David Walsh.

395
00:34:54,771 --> 00:34:56,392
We've got a monster by the tail.

396
00:34:56,992 --> 00:34:58,052
Walsh pounces on it.

397
00:34:58,552 --> 00:35:03,014
He applies for Bre-X to be listed on the Nasdaq and the Toronto Stock Exchange.

398
00:35:06,277 --> 00:35:17,881
Wall Street and investors elsewhere, and analysts elsewhere, were totally on side, were totally enthusiastic, were totally hypnotized by the rising stock price, by the rising claims of Bre-X.

399
00:35:19,922 --> 00:35:22,302
Now de Guzman makes his boldest claim.

400
00:35:23,023 --> 00:35:29,925
Based on drilling results from Busan-2, he declares that Bre-X has the largest gold deposit in the world.

401
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:37,651
The investors just looked at the rising stock price and said, this must be real.

402
00:35:41,152 --> 00:35:51,875
Having built Bre-X into a company worth $6 billion, and with its stock price at nearly $300 a share, it's time for de Guzman to start cashing in.

403
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:56,616
He and his team sell enough shares to be rewarded with over $100 million.

404
00:36:00,709 --> 00:36:09,976
When Felderhoff and when Walsh and when de Guzman started selling a part of their holdings, but not all of it, people just figured, well, that's just guys who've had a tough run all their lives and they're just taking out some insurance.

405
00:36:12,138 --> 00:36:21,446
De Guzman is now worth millions, but what he doesn't know is the Indonesian government is about to make a move that threatens to reveal his scam.

406
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:29,486
Michael de Guzman has pulled off the biggest fraud in mining history.

407
00:36:30,127 --> 00:36:38,333
He's fooled the world's leading investors, turned a penny stock into a billion-dollar venture, and lined his pockets with millions.

408
00:36:39,214 --> 00:36:41,536
But he's now facing a real crisis.

409
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:47,361
The beginning of the end for Briex was a problem in Indonesia.

410
00:36:47,781 --> 00:36:54,306
The Indonesian government, which is hideously corrupt, decides to challenge Briex's claim to this fabulous deposit.

411
00:36:55,605 --> 00:37:04,730
In August of 1996, the Indonesian government revokes Briex's exploration permit and opens the property to other mining companies.

412
00:37:06,825 --> 00:37:11,589
The government itself was going to get very much involved in the ownership of the deposit.

413
00:37:12,089 --> 00:37:16,793
And they were going to invite who they wanted to see to develop the deposit.

414
00:37:17,233 --> 00:37:31,945
So what you saw unfold in rather ugly fashion between the summer of 1996 and the spring of 1997 was this fight amongst major companies for a piece of the action.

415
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:41,932
Michael de Guzman knows his drilling records will soon come under scrutiny from the other mining companies, a move that's sure to reveal the Breach's fraud.

416
00:37:46,692 --> 00:37:52,133
Desperate, he destroys all his records at Busan, claiming it was an accidental fire.

417
00:37:54,674 --> 00:38:00,075
What went up in smoke that day would ultimately help cover the trail of the conspirators that did this fraud.

418
00:38:01,048 --> 00:38:06,691
The Indonesian government forces Briex to accept a new mining partner, Freeport McMoran.

419
00:38:08,852 --> 00:38:13,295
From now on, Briex owns only 45% of Busan.

420
00:38:15,016 --> 00:38:19,258
When news gets out, Briex stock drops $1 billion.

421
00:38:19,979 --> 00:38:21,299
But de Guzman counters.

422
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:27,823
He releases new drilling results that dramatically increase the estimated gold reserves underground.

423
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:35,907
They had previously said that they had 57 million reserves, and they increased that to slightly over 70 million reserves.

424
00:38:36,227 --> 00:38:43,195
Given that the ownership that they had in percentage went down to make the value be the same, they had to increase the reserves.

425
00:38:44,336 --> 00:38:46,138
Bre-X stock rises again.

426
00:38:46,898 --> 00:38:48,200
Shareholders are thrilled.

427
00:38:50,315 --> 00:38:59,100
In the spring of 1997, de Guzman and his team are invited to be guests of honor at Bre-X's annual shareholder meeting in Toronto, Canada.

428
00:39:00,923 --> 00:39:10,190
Michael de Guzman made a presentation as part of the REACT's annual meeting to talk about what he'd found and to talk about what the different drill results had proven that was underneath the ground.

429
00:39:10,611 --> 00:39:18,897
He was able to stand before shareholders with this fabulously expensive stock, a company that's worth $5 billion, and said, look, we did the best deal we could under the circumstances.

430
00:39:19,178 --> 00:39:19,778
We're all rich.

431
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:20,479
Isn't this great?

432
00:39:20,839 --> 00:39:23,221
He was wildly applauded, considered a hero.

433
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:28,005
His theories of mining, even though they were slightly unusual,

434
00:39:29,218 --> 00:39:32,562
seem to be validated by the results.

435
00:39:33,843 --> 00:39:42,413
But on the other side of the world, Bre-X's new partner is anxiously drilling for gold, only yards away from where de Guzman had drilled.

436
00:39:43,534 --> 00:39:45,196
And their samples came up empty.

437
00:39:45,276 --> 00:39:48,100
They weren't finding the gold that Michael de Guzman had said was there.

438
00:39:49,503 --> 00:39:54,225
When de Guzman got the phone call, we don't seem to find any of the gold you say is there.

439
00:39:54,906 --> 00:39:59,808
Get your story behind, back to Indonesia pronto, pal, and explain this to us.

440
00:40:00,488 --> 00:40:08,212
After three years and billions of dollars, time is running out for the mastermind behind the world's largest fraud.

441
00:40:10,973 --> 00:40:18,177
When Briex's powerful new partner doesn't find gold at Busan, Michael de Guzman is forced back to Indonesia.

442
00:40:19,453 --> 00:40:26,938
The next morning, he climbs into the back of a helicopter driven by a Indonesian Air Force officer, takes off over the jungle.

443
00:40:27,058 --> 00:40:32,822
He's about 400 or 500 feet in the air over some of the deepest rainforest in all of Indonesia.

444
00:40:33,483 --> 00:40:36,785
And the pilot looked into the back seat, and de Guzman was gone.

445
00:40:37,525 --> 00:40:39,947
Guzman had jumped out of the helicopter apparently.

446
00:40:42,129 --> 00:40:46,572
Three days later, the Indonesian army claims to find de Guzman's body.

447
00:40:47,367 --> 00:40:50,510
It's badly decomposed and partially eaten by animals.

448
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:55,173
It's so gruesome, the authorities won't let his family view the remains.

449
00:40:56,314 --> 00:41:11,326
It was very difficult to believe that they took two, three days, I recall, to find the body when, in fact, the pilot said he did set the GPS recorder, so they should have been able to find the spot.

450
00:41:12,231 --> 00:41:14,531
Rumors swirl about de Guzman's death.

451
00:41:15,072 --> 00:41:19,872
Was it suicide, murder, or yet another perfectly planned deception?

452
00:41:20,953 --> 00:41:26,154
If you wanted to disappear anywhere on this planet, Indonesia would be one of the easier places to do it.

453
00:41:26,514 --> 00:41:30,494
That you could, for a few hundred dollars, purchase a recently deceased body.

454
00:41:31,514 --> 00:41:36,595
Independent drilling takes place directly beside where de Guzman took thousands of samples.

455
00:41:37,436 --> 00:41:39,816
And not a single ounce of gold is found.

456
00:41:41,483 --> 00:41:46,825
They go and they drill their own core samples, and the security they have around that is unmatched.

457
00:41:46,985 --> 00:41:50,606
They are drilling two or three feet away from where Briexus sets up tons of gold.

458
00:41:51,086 --> 00:41:52,447
All they find is rock flake.

459
00:41:52,687 --> 00:41:53,867
There is no gold there.

460
00:41:54,208 --> 00:41:55,128
It looked so good.

461
00:41:55,148 --> 00:41:56,148
It couldn't be real.

462
00:41:56,208 --> 00:41:57,909
I mean, it was too good to be real.

463
00:41:58,689 --> 00:42:00,070
It's an unbelievable revelation.

464
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:04,751
They just can't believe that this fabulous deposit, in fact, never existed.

465
00:42:05,071 --> 00:42:09,273
Investors around the world suddenly realize they've been had.

466
00:42:10,806 --> 00:42:12,347
Walsh is just flabbergasted.

467
00:42:12,367 --> 00:42:13,948
He cannot believe that this is happening.

468
00:42:14,489 --> 00:42:24,095
And it's at that point that the Breach team in Toronto realizes that they've got nothing to go on, that their stock is going to zero because this was a massive fraud.

469
00:42:24,555 --> 00:42:26,556
Shares themselves are only useful as wallpaper.

470
00:42:27,517 --> 00:42:31,159
David Walsh adamantly denies any knowledge of the fraud.

471
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:33,581
He moves to the Bahamas with his wife.

472
00:42:34,702 --> 00:42:37,964
Two years later, he dies of a massive heart attack.

473
00:42:39,401 --> 00:42:49,125
John Felderhoff continues to live in a gorgeous home right next to the Yacht Club in the Cayman Islands where there's no tax and there's also no extradition treaty with Canada for white collar crimes.

474
00:42:50,445 --> 00:42:57,268
Michael de Guzman, the mastermind behind the greatest mining scam of all time, is supposedly laid to rest.

475
00:42:58,523 --> 00:42:59,784
I compare him to Rumpelstiltskin.

476
00:42:59,844 --> 00:43:03,565
He was able to turn a very small amount of gold into a huge amount.

477
00:43:03,585 --> 00:43:06,007
He spun a story into a huge amount of gold.

478
00:43:06,487 --> 00:43:11,369
No criminal charges have arisen out of the Briac scandal.

479
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:15,231
No one has ever spent a day in jail as a result of it.

480
00:43:15,591 --> 00:43:19,753
The fraud itself has changed the way that Canadian regulators look at the mining industry.

481
00:43:20,033 --> 00:43:25,776
It would be somewhat more difficult to pull off a similar type of scam, but it isn't impossible.

482
00:43:25,856 --> 00:43:27,677
It probably still could be done again.

483
00:43:27,917 --> 00:43:30,418
The adage, caveat emptor, is indeed true.

484
00:43:30,538 --> 00:43:31,359
Buyer beware.

485
00:43:32,499 --> 00:43:37,742
In spite of class action lawsuits, not one investor has ever been compensated.

486
00:43:37,762 --> 00:43:46,807
A harsh reality for thousands of ordinary people who invested their life savings in Bre-X and were left penniless.

487
00:43:47,627 --> 00:43:49,948
I actually believe that Michael de Guzman is alive.

488
00:43:50,248 --> 00:43:52,850
I don't think that he did fall out of that helicopter.

489
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:56,872
I believe that he faked his own death and that he's enjoying the money that he scammed at Bre-X.
