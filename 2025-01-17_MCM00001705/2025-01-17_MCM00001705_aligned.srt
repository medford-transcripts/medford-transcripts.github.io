1
00:00:07,692 --> 00:00:08,553
Good evening, everybody.

2
00:00:09,154 --> 00:00:10,776
This is the Medford Historical Commission.

3
00:00:10,856 --> 00:00:13,019
Today is Monday, January 13th.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:24,133
We have a full agenda tonight, so I will read our statement here that we are required to read for a Zoom meeting, and then we will get started.

5
00:00:24,914 --> 00:00:32,096
Pursuant to the Chapter 20 of the Acts of 2021, this meeting of the City of Medford Historical Commission will be conducted via remote means.

6
00:00:32,536 --> 00:00:37,577
Members of the public who wish to access the meeting may do so by using the Zoom link provided for in the agenda.

7
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:46,520
No in-person attendance of members of the public will be permitted and public participation in any public hearing during this meeting shall be by remote means only.

8
00:00:48,562 --> 00:00:50,703
Okay, so we're going to get started tonight.

9
00:00:50,783 --> 00:00:58,605
We have several cases that we're going to accept applications on and a few that we're going to determine significance on.

10
00:00:59,065 --> 00:01:02,406
These are for the demolition ordinance.

11
00:01:02,866 --> 00:01:06,567
So I'd just like to remind everybody what we're doing tonight.

12
00:01:07,287 --> 00:01:12,469
We're going to accept applications for either partial or total demolition of properties.

13
00:01:13,129 --> 00:01:19,471
And then for a few that we had a heads up on, we will actually go ahead and determine historical significance tonight as well.

14
00:01:19,851 --> 00:01:31,095
And to remind folks that are watching what that means as it pertains to historical significance, that means that the property is either associated, importantly associated with one or more

15
00:01:32,073 --> 00:01:53,902
historic persons or events, or with the broad architectural, cultural, political, economic, or social history of the city or the Commonwealth, or that it is historically or architecturally important in terms of period, style, method of building construction, or association with an important architect or builder, either by itself or in a context of buildings.

16
00:01:54,782 --> 00:02:09,729
And as a reminder, I like to let everybody to remind folks that we do not and will not consider the building's condition or any safety issues when it comes to determine whether anything is significant or future steps would be preferably preserved.

17
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:15,672
Only the building commissioner can determine and properly address any safety issues in that respect.

18
00:02:16,592 --> 00:02:20,114
So for tonight, we're going to start off with 140 Summer Street.

19
00:02:21,355 --> 00:02:23,697
Commissioners, there's a small typo on our agenda.

20
00:02:23,717 --> 00:02:32,723
We're actually going to accept or, you know, review the application and accept the application first and assuming that we are okay to accept that application.

21
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:38,526
We do have a form B on file for this property, so we will go ahead and determine significance.

22
00:02:38,767 --> 00:02:43,430
So if somebody would like to make a motion for the application, we will start with that.

23
00:02:45,409 --> 00:02:46,790
I'll move to accept the application.

24
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,872
I will move to second as to form.

25
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:52,313
OK, Kit and Ed, thank you so much.

26
00:02:53,054 --> 00:03:00,219
So we have a motion on the table to accept the application for demolition for 140 Summit Street that has been seconded.

27
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:04,281
I will go around for a roll call vote as I see folks on my screen.

28
00:03:04,862 --> 00:03:05,302
Ryan.

29
00:03:05,622 --> 00:03:05,862
Yes.

30
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:06,863
Kit.

31
00:03:07,783 --> 00:03:08,024
Yes.

32
00:03:08,644 --> 00:03:09,024
Peter.

33
00:03:09,485 --> 00:03:09,785
Yes.

34
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:10,825
Ed.

35
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:14,448
Yes, as to form.

36
00:03:15,388 --> 00:03:15,828
And Doug.

37
00:03:16,409 --> 00:03:16,669
Yes.

38
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:17,770
Okay.

39
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,351
So the motion is accepted.

40
00:03:19,371 --> 00:03:22,113
Five zero five.

41
00:03:22,173 --> 00:03:24,675
Are we six one, two, three, four, five.

42
00:03:24,735 --> 00:03:25,175
Thank you.

43
00:03:25,195 --> 00:03:28,698
Okay.

44
00:03:29,498 --> 00:03:29,858
Okay.

45
00:03:29,898 --> 00:03:35,182
So now let's move on to the significance discussion for one 40 summer street.

46
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:40,366
If somebody would like to make, to make a motion and open the conversation, I am ready.

47
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:46,455
move to find 140 Summer Street historically significant.

48
00:03:47,856 --> 00:03:48,216
Okay.

49
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,180
Is there a second?

50
00:04:00,124 --> 00:04:02,185
I'll take it.

51
00:04:02,805 --> 00:04:03,826
Yeah, Peter, I'll take you.

52
00:04:03,846 --> 00:04:04,366
Thank you.

53
00:04:06,568 --> 00:04:09,950
Okay, Ryan, if you'd like to jump off the discussions, that would be great.

54
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:10,825
Sure.

55
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:13,106
This is a pre-1875 building.

56
00:04:13,206 --> 00:04:19,470
And as we know, there's probably less than 3,000 pre-1900 buildings, and there's probably half of that are pre-1875.

57
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,591
It's a rare and diminishing type of building.

58
00:04:30,015 --> 00:04:33,216
It seems to be in a fair condition.

59
00:04:34,176 --> 00:04:41,319
Fair to good condition, I guess John put good, but I would more estimate this to be a fair condition house in terms of its integrity.

60
00:04:42,339 --> 00:04:51,482
But I think it's important in terms of its architectural style, its method of building construction, and its period.

61
00:04:51,502 --> 00:04:56,123
Okay, thank you so much.

62
00:04:56,483 --> 00:04:57,704
Peter, I'll come to you next.

63
00:04:59,685 --> 00:05:18,997
Agreed, and I think it's association with the shipbuilding industry that it was owned, the property was probably owned by Curtis and shipbuilders turned carpenters.

64
00:05:20,679 --> 00:05:23,220
most likely built it.

65
00:05:24,001 --> 00:05:30,745
It does seem to have some of its details still in existence, although it's also been changed.

66
00:05:31,705 --> 00:05:38,369
So I think it's worth a second look or a look, just a pause to

67
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:41,023
make sure.

68
00:05:41,143 --> 00:05:48,265
Also, I think it does kind of fit in with the fabric of this part of the street.

69
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:57,006
And some of the other properties have been adapted for new uses.

70
00:06:00,067 --> 00:06:04,868
And I think this one could be as well rather than total demolition.

71
00:06:04,928 --> 00:06:06,768
So I think it's worth a pause.

72
00:06:09,943 --> 00:06:11,303
Okay, thank you so much.

73
00:06:12,404 --> 00:06:13,644
Kit, I'll come to you next.

74
00:06:15,865 --> 00:06:17,766
Yeah.

75
00:06:18,526 --> 00:06:26,168
In reading the application, there were some questions, which I think maybe at this stage are not determinative, I think you have to consider.

76
00:06:27,469 --> 00:06:31,830
One is, again, that if the interior ceilings are that low,

77
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:38,956
whether or not you have preservation, you're going to have major work done.

78
00:06:38,996 --> 00:06:40,477
We're beyond the demolition phase.

79
00:06:40,497 --> 00:06:42,438
The only question is, can we do a restoration?

80
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:52,124
The other question I have, and I just didn't get a clear answer to that, is looking at the plan and the proposed subdivision.

81
00:06:53,565 --> 00:06:55,827
Is this the one with the garage in back?

82
00:06:58,051 --> 00:07:02,876
It does have a garage in the back, from my understanding.

83
00:07:04,217 --> 00:07:10,183
And yes, I believe the main driver for this is the low ceiling.

84
00:07:11,924 --> 00:07:13,306
They're lower than seven feet.

85
00:07:14,587 --> 00:07:21,394
And I will like to point out that the two houses to the right of this one, if you're staring at the front door,

86
00:07:21,914 --> 00:07:30,397
the one immediately to the right and then two doors down, both of those have been significantly rehabbed.

87
00:07:30,557 --> 00:07:42,321
They were under, well, the farther one came before us, and if I remember correctly, the one immediately to the right was not significant, but if I remember correctly,

88
00:07:44,101 --> 00:07:52,089
And I think, you know, if you look at both of those, in my opinion, the builder did a nice job to kind of honor the buildings that were there and the streetscape.

89
00:07:52,149 --> 00:07:55,192
But obviously, you know, we're looking at this case tonight.

90
00:07:56,233 --> 00:07:59,136
But Ryan, there is a garage in the back of this one, correct?

91
00:07:59,597 --> 00:07:59,757
Yep.

92
00:08:00,237 --> 00:08:00,478
Yeah.

93
00:08:00,658 --> 00:08:02,660
But is it a garage or is it a carriage house?

94
00:08:03,868 --> 00:08:09,472
I think it's sort of a late 19th century barn.

95
00:08:09,492 --> 00:08:17,759
I don't think it's a full-blown carriage house, but I do think it was some sort of accessory use building, could have been a workshop.

96
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,742
It's definitely there by 1903, so it's right on the cusp.

97
00:08:28,197 --> 00:08:35,460
It seems to have been labeled as like a three stall auto barn in the 1936 Sanborn.

98
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:40,282
So, you know, it had mixed use.

99
00:08:43,403 --> 00:08:46,024
And do we know what the plan is for that structure?

100
00:08:47,205 --> 00:08:49,486
I think the plan for the site is total demo.

101
00:08:50,706 --> 00:08:52,527
But if you scroll down in the

102
00:08:55,653 --> 00:08:58,954
the demolition application, there is a plan.

103
00:08:59,374 --> 00:09:01,175
Yeah, there are some plans there.

104
00:09:02,755 --> 00:09:03,916
You have to scroll all the way down.

105
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,400
Kate, did you have anything you wanted to add?

106
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:22,002
Yeah, I mean, I would just add that I was really struck by the ties with the shipbuilding history of Medford as well.

107
00:09:22,719 --> 00:09:33,803
And actually the demolition application kind of made me smile because pretty much every house, every building in Medford that's over 75 years old does not meet code.

108
00:09:34,743 --> 00:09:44,466
So I understand if that was the reason why everything, we approved every demolition permit in Medford, there'd be nothing left.

109
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:51,192
Yeah, I'm kind of curious as to why the ceilings are so low on this.

110
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:59,236
On the outside, it's a narrow, tall house, which is typical of the Italian style, but the low ceilings are something else.

111
00:09:59,276 --> 00:10:02,637
So maybe there's just some sort of infill there.

112
00:10:02,717 --> 00:10:03,378
I don't know.

113
00:10:03,718 --> 00:10:13,002
Or it just could be an earlier building that's had its roofline raised, and that what we're looking at is something a little bit earlier.

114
00:10:16,274 --> 00:10:17,055
though.

115
00:10:17,095 --> 00:10:18,717
Doug, do you have anything you want to add?

116
00:10:18,737 --> 00:10:24,883
Yeah, I just, I'm shocked that they could have existing ceilings below seven feet.

117
00:10:24,923 --> 00:10:37,476
I mean, that's obviously barely, I mean, it's supposed to be seven six for modern day code, but that's not even, let's forget about the technicalities, just the comfort of living there is a very big challenge, obviously, for something that low.

118
00:10:38,418 --> 00:10:42,940
You can literally bang your head if you just stand up and raise your hands.

119
00:10:43,641 --> 00:10:44,681
It's just crazy.

120
00:10:44,701 --> 00:10:53,766
I'm okay with a pause, but I'm skeptical about this, because I just don't see it as being part of any kind of district of any kind.

121
00:10:54,866 --> 00:11:00,870
And the building, I think it has a decent integrity, but it's obviously got some big challenges.

122
00:11:02,452 --> 00:11:08,475
I'd have to think about it some more and really look at the plans that they're proposing now too, which you said is a complete demo, right?

123
00:11:08,495 --> 00:11:11,036
Yeah, it is.

124
00:11:11,116 --> 00:11:23,543
Also, I'd just like to say, if they're saying that these ceilings are seven feet, I have to view that statement with a little bit of skepticism because

125
00:11:25,135 --> 00:11:34,570
As an architect who's renovated a lot of houses like this, and I look at this facade, and I see the distance of the number of clabbards from floor to floor,

126
00:11:36,248 --> 00:11:39,770
Maybe on the third floor, there isn't much headroom.

127
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:45,232
But when I look at this, I find it hard to believe that the ceilings are only seven feet.

128
00:11:45,652 --> 00:11:50,514
It's possible that there are multiple layers of drop ceilings or something.

129
00:11:50,854 --> 00:12:00,838
But when I look at this, I mean, you can see that there's quite a distance between the head of the first story windows and the sill of the second story windows.

130
00:12:00,898 --> 00:12:02,378
It looks pretty standard to me.

131
00:12:02,518 --> 00:12:04,319
So I don't know.

132
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:10,803
I'm skeptical, but anyway.

133
00:12:11,444 --> 00:12:16,168
Well, another reason to pause.

134
00:12:16,728 --> 00:12:31,620
One thing which strikes me, and I don't mean, I'm not suggesting there's an integrity problem, is it seems that this house has fallen into absentee family ownership so that

135
00:12:32,466 --> 00:12:38,675
I'm not sure necessarily that what we're hearing from the owner of record is necessarily anything he's actually familiar with.

136
00:12:40,748 --> 00:12:41,909
Yeah, that I don't know.

137
00:12:42,049 --> 00:12:54,378
I mean, I know we don't typically kind of talk about, you know, who's there and family and, you know, what, what they're, you know, what's going on, whether it's rented or not, but yeah.

138
00:12:54,838 --> 00:12:55,298
Yeah.

139
00:12:55,539 --> 00:12:56,259
Yeah.

140
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:59,121
Based on the Form B, this came into family hands.

141
00:12:59,481 --> 00:13:00,702
He's a family at this point.

142
00:13:05,391 --> 00:13:06,572
Okay.

143
00:13:07,572 --> 00:13:12,134
Does anybody else have any comments about this one before we take a vote for significance?

144
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:13,914
Anything else to discuss?

145
00:13:16,335 --> 00:13:25,299
I guess depending on the outcome of the vote, something we could potentially request is a walkthrough if it goes to the next step.

146
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:33,682
So you could, I don't know that they'll agree, but we could certainly request it if that's something that would be important to the board.

147
00:13:35,355 --> 00:13:36,336
So just keep that in mind.

148
00:13:42,439 --> 00:13:42,719
Okay.

149
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:43,360
All right.

150
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:50,123
So for 140 Summer Street, unless anybody else has any further comments, I'm not seeing anything.

151
00:13:50,684 --> 00:13:50,964
Okay.

152
00:13:51,084 --> 00:13:56,547
At 140 Summer Street, we have a motion on the table to find for significance that has been seconded.

153
00:13:56,567 --> 00:14:00,529
I will go around for a roll call vote as I see people on my screen.

154
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:01,790
Ryan.

155
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:02,610
Yes.

156
00:14:03,511 --> 00:14:03,791
Peter.

157
00:14:04,462 --> 00:14:04,782
Yes.

158
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,104
Kit.

159
00:14:06,124 --> 00:14:09,787
Sorry, yes.

160
00:14:11,128 --> 00:14:11,329
Ed.

161
00:14:14,131 --> 00:14:14,472
Yes.

162
00:14:15,973 --> 00:14:16,353
And Doug.

163
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:18,375
Yes for now.

164
00:14:19,056 --> 00:14:19,276
OK.

165
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:21,999
OK.

166
00:14:24,381 --> 00:14:28,603
Okay, so for 140 Summer Street, next month we will hold a preferably preserved hearing.

167
00:14:29,143 --> 00:14:37,106
We will work with the property owner to get the proper notices out in advance of our meeting, which will be on February 10th.

168
00:14:39,027 --> 00:14:42,468
Okay, moving on to our next item agenda.

169
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:45,730
We have 31 Wilson Street.

170
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:53,393
This one is also receiving a demolition application and then assuming we're okay with the application submitted.

171
00:14:54,536 --> 00:14:56,418
we will determine significance as well.

172
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:01,624
If someone would like to make a motion for the application on this one.

173
00:15:04,788 --> 00:15:07,491
Move to accept the application as to form.

174
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:08,452
Thank you, Ed.

175
00:15:08,472 --> 00:15:11,876
Second.

176
00:15:14,136 --> 00:15:14,916
Thank you, Ryan.

177
00:15:15,656 --> 00:15:22,958
Okay, motion to accept the application for demolition for 31 Wilson Street has been made and seconded.

178
00:15:23,478 --> 00:15:23,898
Ryan?

179
00:15:24,378 --> 00:15:24,618
Yes.

180
00:15:25,418 --> 00:15:25,798
Peter?

181
00:15:26,239 --> 00:15:26,539
Yes.

182
00:15:27,239 --> 00:15:27,499
Kit?

183
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,239
Yes.

184
00:15:29,059 --> 00:15:29,239
Ed?

185
00:15:38,221 --> 00:15:38,381
Ed?

186
00:15:39,121 --> 00:15:39,461
Yes.

187
00:15:40,001 --> 00:15:40,442
Thank you.

188
00:15:40,782 --> 00:15:41,162
And Doug?

189
00:15:41,182 --> 00:15:41,242
Yes.

190
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:43,699
Thank you.

191
00:15:43,719 --> 00:15:47,123
OK, so the application is accepted 5-0.

192
00:15:48,144 --> 00:15:54,791
And again, we'll determine significance on this one since we had a heads up and we have a form B ready.

193
00:15:54,811 --> 00:15:59,735
So I'll take a motion for significance or not when someone is ready.

194
00:15:59,755 --> 00:16:03,319
Motion for significance for 31 Wilson Street.

195
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,081
OK, thank you, Ryan.

196
00:16:12,827 --> 00:16:13,508
Is there a second?

197
00:16:13,528 --> 00:16:16,531
I'll second.

198
00:16:18,373 --> 00:16:18,613
Okay.

199
00:16:20,005 --> 00:16:24,968
All right, Ryan, if you want, I'd like to jump off the discussion again on this one for 31 Wilson Street.

200
00:16:25,408 --> 00:16:25,648
Sure.

201
00:16:26,408 --> 00:16:35,253
Fulton Heights is filled with these, a fair number of these little tiny one, one and a half story buildings.

202
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:39,735
And they're often put on postage stamp style lots.

203
00:16:39,815 --> 00:16:44,737
And in the case of this building, it's actually three lots, which the house is located to one side.

204
00:16:46,198 --> 00:17:00,644
And there's a large garage in the back, which is typical because most of the development that happened during this time period, the early 20th century, was the time where autos were making their appearance for virtually everybody, not just the wealthy.

205
00:17:01,544 --> 00:17:08,087
What I was particularly fascinated by was the fact that this house virtually maintains

206
00:17:09,447 --> 00:17:25,235
A fair amount of its integrity, both inside and out, you know, there are some changes like there's cement fiber board siding, but as we've seen for projects that remove that oftentimes the original materials are underneath and just can easily be restored.

207
00:17:26,435 --> 00:17:38,545
you know, the windows are all there with the trim, and then if you look at real estate photos on the inside, the house actually maintains a lot of its original character in there as well.

208
00:17:39,706 --> 00:17:51,235
And even though there's a plan for demolition, I think this particular project can warrant a pause because there is a possibility that maybe we can convince

209
00:17:52,415 --> 00:17:56,557
and influence new construction while allowing the existing house maybe to maintain.

210
00:17:57,338 --> 00:18:05,422
Because we are losing these houses in vast numbers because they are often on larger lots or can be combined with other lots.

211
00:18:05,702 --> 00:18:12,165
And perhaps it might be wise to save a few, especially those that are in fairly good condition.

212
00:18:19,789 --> 00:18:20,129
Great.

213
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:21,130
Thank you, Ryan.

214
00:18:23,325 --> 00:18:24,766
Okay, I'll go to you next.

215
00:18:26,227 --> 00:18:28,549
Yeah, I was really struck with the.

216
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:43,882
Well, first of all, I think the Fulton Heights neighborhood is just a sort of a fascinating rabbit Warren, and, and it seems to me that in terms of keeping intact, kind of a community of houses.

217
00:18:46,048 --> 00:18:46,989
I don't know.

218
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:49,069
I haven't been by this particular one.

219
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:55,752
But it's still a very cohesive streetscape.

220
00:18:57,573 --> 00:18:58,334
So that's the first thing.

221
00:18:58,354 --> 00:19:05,437
And the second thing is, with this particular house, I was really struck with the history of the schoolhouse.

222
00:19:06,377 --> 00:19:11,399
And I was sort of thinking, how many of those are there around in Medford?

223
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,301
Small schoolhouses, and I can't think of any.

224
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:20,200
Now, I realize that this is a bit of its history that needs to be verified.

225
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:24,742
But Ryan, are there any sort of smaller existing schoolhouses?

226
00:19:25,502 --> 00:19:32,026
Well, the one on Summer Street that got developed a couple of years ago, we predicted that might have been a schoolhouse.

227
00:19:33,190 --> 00:20:01,825
yeah where uh... we're not sure and i just uh... there's like a disconnect i still need to go back to city hall and uh... check the older financial records to see who the city who paid for that building and that will tell us so somewhere on summer street i don't john and i were pretty confident after we saw the interior demolition of summer street that it wasn't well that wasn't the schoolhouse in action wasn't there but somewhere on summer street is a there is an earlier

228
00:20:02,966 --> 00:20:06,069
1820s, 1830s wooden schoolhouse building.

229
00:20:06,129 --> 00:20:21,186
And this particular building, if it were a schoolhouse, it would have been removed from another community, but it also would be extremely, extremely rare to have some sort of wooden frame schoolhouse building even standing from an earlier period.

230
00:20:22,607 --> 00:20:28,769
I mean, it has the has the right window arrangements on the outside as like a one or two room schoolhouse.

231
00:20:28,849 --> 00:20:33,030
But, you know, the interior floor plan based on the photos is a little bit different than that.

232
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:38,771
So but I mean, we can always if we do a walkthrough, get a sense based on looking at it.

233
00:20:43,252 --> 00:20:43,572
Great.

234
00:20:44,973 --> 00:20:45,993
Peter, anything to add?

235
00:20:48,097 --> 00:20:50,438
Oh, no, I think it's a it's an interesting little house.

236
00:20:50,578 --> 00:20:57,101
And I will I too was struck by the the chain of ownership, I guess.

237
00:20:58,762 --> 00:21:17,010
And, you know, being the consistent chain of ownership and the schoolhouse thing, although I guess that's speculation, but on the part of the owner, but I also think like due to the large lot, maybe

238
00:21:18,254 --> 00:21:29,263
if the lot was developed creatively, this is sort of echoing what Ryan said that maybe it could be incorporated.

239
00:21:29,283 --> 00:21:37,430
I mean, you could add dormers to it or whatever, but as part of a larger build out, that's it.

240
00:21:39,752 --> 00:21:41,093
Ed, anything to add on this one?

241
00:21:42,674 --> 00:21:47,398
Again, it's just looking at clearly the plan seems to be

242
00:21:49,045 --> 00:21:50,787
to cut it back into two lots again.

243
00:21:50,827 --> 00:21:54,012
And what happens to the garage?

244
00:21:54,032 --> 00:22:02,923
Again, what looks like a probably not particularly significant garage, but they got the garage over the lot line.

245
00:22:02,983 --> 00:22:03,824
Is that going with it?

246
00:22:04,105 --> 00:22:06,548
I mean, is that planned to be demolished with it?

247
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,681
Do we have confirmation of that Ryan?

248
00:22:11,701 --> 00:22:13,583
I would imagine it's everything.

249
00:22:13,603 --> 00:22:18,987
Yeah, it's it's the notice of intent says it's everything, but let me just look real quick at the proposed plans.

250
00:22:19,067 --> 00:22:21,269
I'm pretty certain that the house is not.

251
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,971
They're going to like center the house.

252
00:22:25,786 --> 00:22:29,089
I'm sure they have to with this setbacks and zoning now.

253
00:22:29,529 --> 00:22:29,949
Yeah.

254
00:22:29,969 --> 00:22:33,232
So they're going to read a portion of the property?

255
00:22:33,992 --> 00:22:34,993
Yeah.

256
00:22:35,033 --> 00:22:36,474
Three lots side by side.

257
00:22:36,514 --> 00:22:41,918
So I would imagine whatever they put there new, they're going to have to center and make a driveway and a garage.

258
00:22:42,058 --> 00:22:42,318
Yeah.

259
00:22:42,358 --> 00:22:46,661
So they have, it's three lots, but they're going to subdivide it into two lots.

260
00:22:47,122 --> 00:22:53,086
So they'll have two houses, one next to the other on both the garage and the houses to be raised.

261
00:22:53,126 --> 00:22:53,987
But maybe we can,

262
00:22:54,667 --> 00:23:01,912
convince them just to build, you know, if they raise a garage, maybe convince them to build just one house and leave the other house alone, you know.

263
00:23:04,815 --> 00:23:06,336
Doug, anything to add on this one?

264
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:11,881
I guess I'm kind of highly skeptical that this site can be saved.

265
00:23:11,921 --> 00:23:16,764
I'm willing to pause here and vote to kind of just take a fresh look at it.

266
00:23:16,804 --> 00:23:27,091
But this house just doesn't, I mean, it doesn't look like if you did what you need to make it the size space of living that you would want for.

267
00:23:28,592 --> 00:23:34,435
a property of this scale, I don't think there'd be much left of the house when we're done, whether you raise the roof.

268
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:38,938
It's just an odd little property.

269
00:23:38,998 --> 00:23:40,359
I don't know how else to say it.

270
00:23:41,659 --> 00:23:47,022
But I'm willing to take a look at it because I haven't spent any time obviously with the site plan and I don't know if the owner is willing to engage us.

271
00:23:47,082 --> 00:23:53,025
But if they're not, I'd hesitate to take it much further because I just don't see it.

272
00:23:53,045 --> 00:23:55,087
It seems like there's a lot to do here.

273
00:23:55,507 --> 00:23:57,468
It's almost like starting over no matter what you do.

274
00:23:58,634 --> 00:24:08,320
I mean, there is something to be said about the very real possibility that Medford won't have any, I guess, starter homes, for lack of a better term.

275
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:19,927
I mean, not every building needs to be built out to the maximum, in my opinion, especially given that if they're subdividing the lot and they're able to build a whole second

276
00:24:20,507 --> 00:24:24,808
home, a new construction home, you've done both.

277
00:24:24,828 --> 00:24:29,809
You've kept both the starter home and you've gotten a new construction home on the site.

278
00:24:30,289 --> 00:24:37,290
Now, whether or not that meets the owner's ability to make a profit or not is something that he's going to have to tell us.

279
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:42,251
But, you know, just something to toy around with.

280
00:24:43,072 --> 00:24:49,673
Not every building, in my opinion, needs to be built because not everybody's going to be able to afford that large

281
00:24:50,919 --> 00:25:12,272
luxurious home i guess well i think on this one too kind of coming back to what kit said about the neighborhood um and i think ryan even what you said about you know it's this little bungalow up at the top of the hill and you know i think on this one i i don't want to say more so than others but i think just given the

282
00:25:12,912 --> 00:25:24,176
the character of the Fulton Heights neighborhood, I personally would be curious to hear from the neighbors, which would come with, you know, preferably preserved hearing and public notice.

283
00:25:24,996 --> 00:25:25,196
Yeah.

284
00:25:25,316 --> 00:25:33,839
And also after February, ADUs, I mean, we can already build ADUs here in Medford, but ADUs will become infinitely easier by right.

285
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:40,442
So, and they could put a small up to 900 square feet dwelling unit on,

286
00:25:41,595 --> 00:25:43,336
on both of the houses, right?

287
00:25:43,356 --> 00:25:44,477
So even the new construction.

288
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:50,981
No, well, it can't be more than it's up to 900 square feet, but 50% of the main house.

289
00:25:51,881 --> 00:25:56,484
So if this existing house stays, it can't be bigger than 50% of that house.

290
00:25:58,666 --> 00:26:01,687
So I'm actually getting, I'm having a class next month.

291
00:26:01,988 --> 00:26:04,429
So I'll have all kinds of information to share on that.

292
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:06,130
Okay.

293
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:09,672
The state's supposed to come out with the new details on February 1st.

294
00:26:10,473 --> 00:26:10,713
Sweet.

295
00:26:12,716 --> 00:26:17,117
Okay, anything else to discuss on this one before we vote for significance?

296
00:26:20,058 --> 00:26:25,959
Okay, so for 31 Wilson Street, we have a motion that's been seconded to find for historical significance.

297
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:27,419
Roll call vote.

298
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:28,039
Ryan.

299
00:26:28,399 --> 00:26:28,659
Yes.

300
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,060
Peter.

301
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,100
Yes.

302
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:32,320
Kit.

303
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,461
Yes.

304
00:26:34,481 --> 00:26:34,521
Ed.

305
00:26:37,421 --> 00:26:38,081
Yes, again.

306
00:26:38,101 --> 00:26:40,102
Doug.

307
00:26:41,302 --> 00:26:41,522
Yes.

308
00:26:42,358 --> 00:26:51,486
Okay, so this one is significant, so we will have a preferably preserved hearing for that one next month as well.

309
00:26:54,068 --> 00:26:58,451
Jen, do you think the owners will engage us in the time period between this meeting and the next?

310
00:26:59,893 --> 00:27:00,593
For a walkthrough?

311
00:27:01,754 --> 00:27:04,837
Just to look at the site, to pause the process.

312
00:27:06,267 --> 00:27:07,188
I love the walkthrough too.

313
00:27:07,628 --> 00:27:08,268
Yeah, I'm not sure.

314
00:27:08,348 --> 00:27:18,854
I mean, I'll certainly, I'm certainly happy to reach out to the owners of Wilson and Summer Street to see if they would allow us to do a walkthrough and then I can circle back with everybody on a date and time.

315
00:27:18,874 --> 00:27:19,934
Okay.

316
00:27:21,555 --> 00:27:35,262
And then if you have specific questions on either property, send them to me and I'll be happy to, you know, ask the commissioner, ask the property owners those questions in advance of the next hearing as well.

317
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:42,123
And certainly, I'm sure they'll be there as well.

318
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:42,523
Okay.

319
00:27:44,404 --> 00:27:50,147
We have two applications that are on the agenda that we have to accept next, plus a third.

320
00:27:50,247 --> 00:27:52,027
I'm not sure if you guys all saw my email.

321
00:27:52,328 --> 00:27:56,590
We did get a late arrival application that is on here officially.

322
00:27:57,831 --> 00:28:03,737
Let's just see if we can take all three and then we can get the process started for these folks.

323
00:28:03,877 --> 00:28:09,404
And we did not have enough heads up on these three to determine significance tonight.

324
00:28:09,444 --> 00:28:13,508
We have to still have our form Bs ordered and delivered.

325
00:28:13,528 --> 00:28:13,908
So, yes.

326
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:20,971
Oh my God, I can't believe I skipped right over that.

327
00:28:21,051 --> 00:28:21,732
I'm so sorry.

328
00:28:22,172 --> 00:28:23,653
Apologies, apologies.

329
00:28:24,394 --> 00:28:26,375
Okay, next up for Grove Street.

330
00:28:28,016 --> 00:28:30,898
We will be receiving a demolition application on this one.

331
00:28:30,918 --> 00:28:35,442
And then assuming that's accepted, determining significance.

332
00:28:35,882 --> 00:28:37,723
Just a little background on this one.

333
00:28:38,844 --> 00:28:41,006
They have been rehabbing this property.

334
00:28:42,348 --> 00:28:48,453
Um, we, uh, you know, permit came through, we approved, they were doing some small dormers up on the third floor.

335
00:28:48,473 --> 00:28:56,700
Um, and then right after Thanksgiving, uh, the porches got ripped off without approval.

336
00:28:57,481 --> 00:29:04,006
Um, so this project has been stopped and they are coming before us now for demolition review.

337
00:29:05,087 --> 00:29:10,892
Um, so commissioners, if somebody would like to make a motion on this one, we can get started.

338
00:29:13,602 --> 00:29:16,964
I will move to accept the application as to form.

339
00:29:17,305 --> 00:29:17,925
Thank you, Ed.

340
00:29:25,991 --> 00:29:26,832
Is there a second?

341
00:29:28,653 --> 00:29:29,213
I'll second.

342
00:29:30,314 --> 00:29:31,215
I'll take hit.

343
00:29:31,795 --> 00:29:32,295
Thank you.

344
00:29:33,276 --> 00:29:37,779
Okay, motion to accept the application for demolition for 4 Grove Street.

345
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:38,700
Ryan?

346
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:39,280
Yes.

347
00:29:40,041 --> 00:29:40,361
Peter?

348
00:29:40,381 --> 00:29:40,441
Yes.

349
00:29:42,023 --> 00:29:42,283
Kit?

350
00:29:42,723 --> 00:29:42,963
Yes.

351
00:29:43,723 --> 00:29:43,923
Ed?

352
00:29:46,124 --> 00:29:46,924
Yes, as to form.

353
00:29:47,404 --> 00:29:47,844
And Doug?

354
00:29:48,364 --> 00:29:48,664
Yes.

355
00:29:49,304 --> 00:29:50,124
Okay, thank you.

356
00:29:51,325 --> 00:29:57,826
Okay, so now for significance for Grove Street, if somebody would like to make a motion on that one.

357
00:29:57,846 --> 00:30:04,027
Move for significance.

358
00:30:05,467 --> 00:30:06,127
Thank you, Ryan.

359
00:30:06,627 --> 00:30:07,307
Is there a second?

360
00:30:07,327 --> 00:30:11,388
I'll second.

361
00:30:12,055 --> 00:30:12,615
Thank you, Ed.

362
00:30:14,755 --> 00:30:15,396
Okay, Ryan.

363
00:30:17,176 --> 00:30:23,317
I think it's similar to the property that we had at 28 Grove Street.

364
00:30:24,317 --> 00:30:28,918
It's associated with George Woodland, developer from Melrose.

365
00:30:29,138 --> 00:30:32,619
He was also a prolific builder of most of these houses.

366
00:30:32,659 --> 00:30:39,800
They all share, in this immediate vicinity, they all share sort of the same form and style and plan.

367
00:30:40,507 --> 00:30:45,350
It's all related to this little organization called the West Medford Real Estate Trust.

368
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:52,113
It's all laid out on Brooks family land over the early 20th century.

369
00:30:52,454 --> 00:30:57,996
And I think both the immediate neighborhood and the larger development are still coherent.

370
00:30:58,077 --> 00:31:01,819
So I think it's important to preserve as much of that as possible.

371
00:31:01,999 --> 00:31:03,639
So I am for significance.

372
00:31:06,021 --> 00:31:06,701
Thank you, Ryan.

373
00:31:08,782 --> 00:31:09,883
Ed, anything to add on this?

374
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:14,519
No.

375
00:31:14,779 --> 00:31:17,140
Did you say that we had voted on this one before?

376
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:17,200
No.

377
00:31:18,121 --> 00:31:19,661
We didn't vote on it.

378
00:31:20,261 --> 00:31:29,245
It came through the permitting and we approved it based on the plans that they had submitted, which did not include any porch alterations.

379
00:31:31,426 --> 00:31:31,766
All right.

380
00:31:31,826 --> 00:31:34,667
So there has not been a significance vote yet?

381
00:31:35,347 --> 00:31:35,767
Correct.

382
00:31:36,108 --> 00:31:36,748
At any point?

383
00:31:37,288 --> 00:31:37,668
Correct.

384
00:31:37,808 --> 00:31:37,928
OK.

385
00:31:37,948 --> 00:31:38,088
Yeah.

386
00:31:38,569 --> 00:31:40,709
So we're finding the entire building

387
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:44,674
Significant or the porch, the entire building?

388
00:31:45,035 --> 00:31:46,059
The whole house.

389
00:31:48,169 --> 00:31:54,431
Yeah, this is at the corner of Grove and High Street, kind of like a cornerstone property.

390
00:31:54,831 --> 00:32:00,593
Even more so now they've taken out all the shrubs that were along the corner and trimmed up the tree.

391
00:32:00,673 --> 00:32:06,354
So before it was really difficult to see the house and now you can really see it.

392
00:32:07,355 --> 00:32:09,916
I drive by it multiple times a day on my way home.

393
00:32:10,916 --> 00:32:14,357
And yeah, right now the porch is,

394
00:32:14,957 --> 00:32:16,038
Looking pretty sad.

395
00:32:16,218 --> 00:32:24,346
All the columns are gone and the stone foundation is gone and there's some terrible plastic lattice around the bottom.

396
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:27,730
point of clarification?

397
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:28,430
Yes.

398
00:32:29,431 --> 00:32:51,255
I think just it's important to point out for the benefit of anybody watching and the applicants that when we review these projects for when they have been or when we deal with unauthorized demolitions, we review the pre-construction condition for significance and then we take into account the

399
00:32:52,315 --> 00:32:53,496
if it is a significant building.

400
00:32:53,536 --> 00:33:10,688
We take into account its current condition a little bit more closely when we deal with integrity, but we oftentimes know what buildings look like and we'll certainly take that into consideration when it's been removed.

401
00:33:13,062 --> 00:33:16,804
And just for this one, it's hard to see it on Google Earth.

402
00:33:17,564 --> 00:33:22,827
And even when the property was sold, because the trees and the shrubs were all kind of in front of it.

403
00:33:22,867 --> 00:33:31,071
So it was really hard to see kind of that beautiful detail on the porch as it was before it was all ripped down.

404
00:33:31,091 --> 00:33:31,131
So.

405
00:33:35,765 --> 00:33:45,772
I will say the Form B has some good side-by-side photos of it, you know, in its original, quote-unquote, original state.

406
00:33:47,533 --> 00:33:56,399
And after the reconstruction of the new porches, I didn't realize that it had those current photos, but I'm looking at them now.

407
00:33:56,419 --> 00:33:58,380
They do tell a tale.

408
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:04,765
Yeah, and the dormers on the side, that little shed dormer,

409
00:34:06,268 --> 00:34:09,251
You know, they've changed some of the windows and things in the front one.

410
00:34:09,271 --> 00:34:20,162
And on the dormers themselves, like the whole house is stucco, and the dormers have this kind of that vertical siding that everybody's using these days.

411
00:34:21,183 --> 00:34:30,332
So it doesn't really match, but they put the little shed dormers on both sides of the property.

412
00:34:37,567 --> 00:34:39,449
Peter, did you have anything else to add on this one?

413
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:41,670
No, not really.

414
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:43,312
Kit?

415
00:34:46,414 --> 00:34:46,634
Nope.

416
00:34:47,535 --> 00:34:47,875
Doug?

417
00:34:50,257 --> 00:34:52,279
No, it's an unfortunate situation, obviously.

418
00:34:55,081 --> 00:34:55,361
Okay.

419
00:34:55,922 --> 00:35:02,447
All right, then we have a motion for significance on the table for 4 Grove Street that has been seconded.

420
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:04,288
I will go around for a roll call vote.

421
00:35:05,109 --> 00:35:05,529
Ryan?

422
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:06,190
Yes.

423
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:07,423
Peter.

424
00:35:08,084 --> 00:35:08,344
Yes.

425
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:09,304
Kit.

426
00:35:09,705 --> 00:35:09,925
Yes.

427
00:35:10,825 --> 00:35:11,026
Ed.

428
00:35:13,267 --> 00:35:13,627
Yes.

429
00:35:14,548 --> 00:35:14,928
And Doug.

430
00:35:16,129 --> 00:35:16,429
Yes.

431
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:17,690
Okay.

432
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:19,951
So significance on this one, five zero.

433
00:35:20,492 --> 00:35:24,254
So we will have a preferably preserved hearing for this one next month as well.

434
00:35:27,424 --> 00:35:37,311
Okay, so now we will move on to the applications that we are accepting for 26 Rockwell and 76 Court Street.

435
00:35:37,712 --> 00:35:45,678
And then as I mentioned in my email that I sent out about 640, we did receive an application for 115 Emerald Street.

436
00:35:46,618 --> 00:35:49,661
So let's start with 26 Rockwell.

437
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:56,626
If somebody would like to make a motion on this one or not, or pass on review.

438
00:35:59,759 --> 00:36:02,461
I motion that the application is complete and we accept it.

439
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:04,462
OK, thank you, Ryan.

440
00:36:06,823 --> 00:36:07,203
Second.

441
00:36:09,684 --> 00:36:10,004
OK.

442
00:36:11,265 --> 00:36:17,288
OK, motion to accept the application for 26 Rockwell Ave has been seconded.

443
00:36:17,548 --> 00:36:18,669
Ryan, yes.

444
00:36:19,409 --> 00:36:20,810
Peter, yes.

445
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:22,571
Kit, yes.

446
00:36:23,391 --> 00:36:23,571
Ed.

447
00:36:26,033 --> 00:36:26,813
Yes, as before.

448
00:36:27,313 --> 00:36:28,454
And Doug, yes.

449
00:36:29,527 --> 00:36:30,267
Okay, great.

450
00:36:30,968 --> 00:36:38,750
So that one, we will order a form B on and do significance, have significance discussion on that next month.

451
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:42,611
Next up, we have 76 Court Street, same.

452
00:36:42,631 --> 00:36:45,652
We are accepting the application.

453
00:36:45,712 --> 00:36:49,934
Again, this was another one that had unauthorized demolition.

454
00:36:50,578 --> 00:36:54,779
The project was stopped right before Christmas.

455
00:36:55,059 --> 00:36:57,400
There's a good chunk of this house gone.

456
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:03,501
I don't know, Ryan, you put those pictures in the folder as well as the ones we got from the applicant.

457
00:37:08,042 --> 00:37:08,942
If not, we have them.

458
00:37:08,962 --> 00:37:11,103
I did not.

459
00:37:11,743 --> 00:37:12,763
OK, well, we have them.

460
00:37:13,863 --> 00:37:20,405
But I will take a motion on this one as well when someone's ready.

461
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:26,012
Motion to accept the application.

462
00:37:27,893 --> 00:37:29,754
Okay, pointed question.

463
00:37:30,274 --> 00:37:31,455
Yes, Peter.

464
00:37:32,716 --> 00:37:36,879
I noticed on the intent to demolish form.

465
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:45,685
They don't have partial or total circled, but it says see addendum a and b and plans attached.

466
00:37:47,456 --> 00:37:51,121
I didn't really have time to know what that meant.

467
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:53,224
Is it for total demo?

468
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:55,207
No, it's partial.

469
00:37:55,427 --> 00:37:59,453
It's the rear half of the house.

470
00:38:01,175 --> 00:38:03,138
I think they're trying to make two units there.

471
00:38:03,765 --> 00:38:20,854
Yeah, there's a small addition that they removed, but the real reason why this project is being reviewed is because they have gone beyond the scope of their permit and removed far more than was approved to do work, basically.

472
00:38:23,516 --> 00:38:23,756
So.

473
00:38:23,816 --> 00:38:30,159
Yeah, the upper story of the upper rear of the roof is completely gone.

474
00:38:30,179 --> 00:38:31,540
Okay, thank you.

475
00:38:32,688 --> 00:38:42,131
Well, I'll drop the photos in the folder that we have so you guys can see it in its current state or take a drive by if you get a chance.

476
00:38:43,591 --> 00:38:50,013
Okay, so there's a motion that was submitted by Ryan to accept the application for 76 court.

477
00:38:50,113 --> 00:38:50,893
Is there a second?

478
00:38:55,634 --> 00:38:56,715
Yes, it is to form.

479
00:38:56,935 --> 00:38:57,615
Okay, thank you, Ed.

480
00:38:59,148 --> 00:39:02,970
Okay, motion to accept the application for 76 Court Street.

481
00:39:04,171 --> 00:39:04,511
Ryan?

482
00:39:04,932 --> 00:39:05,212
Yes.

483
00:39:05,832 --> 00:39:06,192
Peter?

484
00:39:06,613 --> 00:39:06,853
Yes.

485
00:39:07,493 --> 00:39:07,733
Kit?

486
00:39:08,174 --> 00:39:08,414
Yes.

487
00:39:09,194 --> 00:39:09,375
Ed?

488
00:39:11,536 --> 00:39:12,256
Yes as to former.

489
00:39:12,957 --> 00:39:13,357
And Doug?

490
00:39:13,697 --> 00:39:14,037
Yes.

491
00:39:14,678 --> 00:39:15,358
Okay, thank you.

492
00:39:16,839 --> 00:39:22,243
Okay, and then last up to receive the application for demolition is 115 Emerald Street.

493
00:39:23,183 --> 00:39:27,366
And I will take a motion from somebody when you're ready.

494
00:39:32,325 --> 00:39:33,906
move to accept the application.

495
00:39:34,967 --> 00:39:35,748
Okay, thanks, Ryan.

496
00:39:35,768 --> 00:39:38,350
I'll second.

497
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:39,451
Thanks, Kit.

498
00:39:41,652 --> 00:39:45,896
Okay, motion to accept the application for 115 Emerald Street.

499
00:39:46,436 --> 00:39:46,857
Ryan?

500
00:39:47,297 --> 00:39:47,517
Yes.

501
00:39:48,758 --> 00:39:49,058
Peter?

502
00:39:50,219 --> 00:39:50,540
Yes.

503
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:51,600
Kit?

504
00:39:52,201 --> 00:39:52,361
Yes.

505
00:39:53,262 --> 00:39:53,422
Ed?

506
00:39:57,805 --> 00:40:00,908
I'm almost inclined to question whether it's complete, but I'll say yes.

507
00:40:02,267 --> 00:40:03,228
Okay, and Doug.

508
00:40:03,628 --> 00:40:03,928
Yes.

509
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:14,516
It should, I think it really was Ed, so that we have photos of all four sides, the site plan, the application and plans.

510
00:40:15,536 --> 00:40:15,836
Okay.

511
00:40:17,618 --> 00:40:20,119
Who moved and seconded on that one?

512
00:40:20,139 --> 00:40:23,302
It was Ryan made the motion and Kit seconded it.

513
00:40:23,882 --> 00:40:24,222
Okay.

514
00:40:25,163 --> 00:40:26,464
And it was a five zero.

515
00:40:26,484 --> 00:40:29,286
Okay.

516
00:40:29,666 --> 00:40:30,607
Pass, okay.

517
00:40:32,127 --> 00:40:39,492
Okay, I think, unless there's something else that I don't know about, that is all of our casework for tonight.

518
00:40:39,992 --> 00:40:53,400
So next month we will have three preferably preserved hearings and three significance hearings, and then any new applications that come in.

519
00:40:55,081 --> 00:40:57,303
So pack a cooler, it might be a long night.

520
00:41:01,261 --> 00:41:03,005
Um, okay.

521
00:41:07,303 --> 00:41:10,686
Ryan, do you have anything else before we move on to the cemetery?

522
00:41:10,706 --> 00:41:16,651
Yeah, just so folks know, we're preemptively ordering an MHC Form B for 38 Spring Street.

523
00:41:16,691 --> 00:41:18,432
That's why it's on the agenda.

524
00:41:18,953 --> 00:41:20,694
Received a bunch of inquiries on it.

525
00:41:20,714 --> 00:41:21,715
It's not a large lot.

526
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:29,321
It's fairly good condition in terms of integrity, but most people probably think it needs work.

527
00:41:29,902 --> 00:41:36,207
So check out the real estate photos if you want to take a gander at it.

528
00:41:36,878 --> 00:41:45,707
And then there was another building on 19 Curtis Street 19th century building that we're is being eyed for review.

529
00:41:45,827 --> 00:41:53,014
So I had john do forms, but he's not going to be able to get to them until that and Spring Street until March meeting.

530
00:41:53,075 --> 00:41:56,438
So we're prioritizing those that are coming up for demo first.

531
00:41:57,499 --> 00:41:59,501
So but in terms of our budget will be pretty good.

532
00:41:59,541 --> 00:42:00,142
So even if we

533
00:42:01,492 --> 00:42:07,226
spend four forms a month until June, then we'll be good in terms of our spending our budget down.

534
00:42:07,286 --> 00:42:08,249
So great.

535
00:42:09,684 --> 00:42:23,535
Yeah, and I think we had a heads up on some of these tonight, so we were able to do significance in addition to taking the application, which I think is obviously a great time saver for folks.

536
00:42:23,575 --> 00:42:32,702
So anytime we can get things ordered and kind of shave some time off of the timeline, we are happy to do that, as long as we have the Form B.

537
00:42:33,478 --> 00:42:44,107
Yeah, and I do think that we, we, it's further down the list but if we do need to discuss 27 Almond Street, just to see if there's anything we want to do there too as well.

538
00:42:44,127 --> 00:42:48,291
Okay, but I'll, I'll save that for after the cemetery.

539
00:42:48,311 --> 00:42:50,413
All right, go for it.

540
00:42:52,007 --> 00:42:52,207
Okay.

541
00:42:53,068 --> 00:43:06,865
I've been working with the cemetery trustees and Fannin Lehner, who is the consultant that we hired collectively to do the cemetery headstone assessment for the relocated Cross Street Cemetery at

542
00:43:07,405 --> 00:43:08,386
Oak Grove.

543
00:43:09,267 --> 00:43:21,559
So Fan and Lehner came back with a pretty detailed report, a wonderful set of documents that's going to be very easy to convert over to scope for bidding.

544
00:43:22,019 --> 00:43:29,046
And their number, bottom line, was about $70,000 for the 100 or so stones that need work in that cemetery.

545
00:43:29,807 --> 00:43:40,031
It complicates the way that the cemetery was moved and the headstones set, complicates that work and accounts for a bit of its costs.

546
00:43:40,091 --> 00:43:50,634
Normally it's actually probably cheaper to restore stones, but all of the headstones, except for the biggest monuments, are all set in a concrete base.

547
00:43:51,335 --> 00:43:56,336
And so we have to re-anchor the existing stones in and there's no way to pull them out.

548
00:43:58,517 --> 00:43:59,438
You know, it is what it is.

549
00:44:00,939 --> 00:44:05,243
I'm also working with a mason to get a cost estimate for the wall.

550
00:44:06,244 --> 00:44:08,106
He didn't believe that it was in bad condition.

551
00:44:08,126 --> 00:44:15,813
He thought that it just needed some very minor repointing and a lot of organic growth removed, because that is a very wet area.

552
00:44:15,913 --> 00:44:18,916
But once that's done, it should be in relatively good condition.

553
00:44:21,785 --> 00:44:30,832
he was talking with his metal fabricator to reproduce the other gate that's missing from the cemetery.

554
00:44:30,892 --> 00:44:36,917
So we'll have two gates and it'll be all painted and the cemetery will be back in

555
00:44:37,818 --> 00:44:55,873
a nice condition at the end of the project we are right is this cpc yeah i think it will be cpc funding uh that will be necessary but um in the interim between now and then i am trying to reach out to veronica shaw from the uh

556
00:44:56,854 --> 00:45:01,800
veterans group to try to get some veterans funding to restore the veteran stones first.

557
00:45:02,622 --> 00:45:12,654
And I was going to try to partner that with some CPC small grant funding and perhaps a grant from freedoms way who funded the part of the assessment.

558
00:45:13,275 --> 00:45:31,259
So we're trying to do that as both a pilot project to see how the restoration work will progress and how tough it's going to be, but also to tie us over for the duration until we can apply for CPC funding next fall.

559
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:42,662
Unless Doug thinks that the CPC might entertain an off-season application, but I don't

560
00:45:43,562 --> 00:45:49,006
I don't think so because there's no pressing need for it other than maybe just getting the work done.

561
00:45:49,026 --> 00:45:52,709
No, I think it really has to be an emergency.

562
00:45:53,597 --> 00:45:54,978
I don't know if this would qualify.

563
00:45:54,998 --> 00:45:58,259
How much is it, Ryan?

564
00:45:58,279 --> 00:46:02,241
It's $70,000 for the stones, but it'd probably be around $100,000 all told.

565
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:07,983
If we do it in one shot, $100,000, we could phase it out over two years.

566
00:46:08,023 --> 00:46:11,885
The consultants can only do so much work themselves, too.

567
00:46:12,585 --> 00:46:16,327
It's weather dependent, and some of the stuff takes two, three

568
00:46:17,367 --> 00:46:21,672
Applications before it's ready for final, like, you know, to put the stone actually back together.

569
00:46:21,833 --> 00:46:23,815
So, uh, you know.

570
00:46:25,557 --> 00:46:28,580
Sort of that to me is I mean, how.

571
00:46:29,221 --> 00:46:34,347
How long will, you know, once we get approval and funding, how long does this work really take?

572
00:46:34,407 --> 00:46:36,690
Because it looks like it's a fair amount.

573
00:46:37,676 --> 00:46:41,461
Yeah, I think I mean it's it's probably two phases.

574
00:46:41,481 --> 00:46:44,765
I mean, we could probably stretch it out for three, but I think two is realistic.

575
00:46:45,867 --> 00:46:55,038
We are meeting the city is trying to tie this into a request for funding for another project that we're working on.

576
00:46:56,119 --> 00:47:04,626
And we're hopeful that if the city, we're hopeful that the state or other entities might pitch in, and that might expedite work.

577
00:47:04,866 --> 00:47:21,798
And the consultants, meaning Finn and Lehner, are mulling over the idea that they might be able to express this work by working with some of the people that are in their field together as a collaborative venture.

578
00:47:23,487 --> 00:47:26,888
a handful of people that do this work, but they might be willing to partner.

579
00:47:28,869 --> 00:47:37,333
They all share the same methodologies and the same methods, so they might be willing to partner to get this project done all at once.

580
00:47:40,954 --> 00:47:48,437
And it may be timely, we don't know, but we definitely want to get it done over the next year or two.

581
00:47:50,208 --> 00:48:01,096
So it just, you know, it's, it's a little bit disappointing because it took the city nearly six or eight months once we had the grants to set up the proper accounting so that we could get going.

582
00:48:01,536 --> 00:48:08,121
So I probably could have gotten CPC funding, but I just, uh, I think, you know, it's fine.

583
00:48:08,301 --> 00:48:12,404
It'll just, this project will move right along with the other project that it's related to.

584
00:48:12,424 --> 00:48:15,886
So, so, so we're talking 25 and 26 in all likelihood.

585
00:48:15,927 --> 00:48:15,987
Yep.

586
00:48:23,856 --> 00:48:25,717
And we have the cemetery trustees to help us.

587
00:48:25,797 --> 00:48:36,122
I think there's a three-person trustee board plus Steve Brogan, who's the caretaker on site and the, I forget his proper term.

588
00:48:36,142 --> 00:48:42,665
I guess he's the cemetery custodian is not the right word.

589
00:48:45,570 --> 00:48:48,553
Oh, it escapes me, but he's he's the boots on the ground guy.

590
00:48:48,573 --> 00:48:53,537
So, um, you know, I, I think they're called a curator for this purpose.

591
00:48:54,077 --> 00:48:54,558
Yeah.

592
00:48:54,738 --> 00:48:54,938
Yeah.

593
00:48:54,958 --> 00:48:58,541
I mean, they're very, they're, they're pleased that we have this scope of work.

594
00:48:58,581 --> 00:49:00,743
So now we just need to keep moving forward.

595
00:49:06,048 --> 00:49:08,570
Um, so yeah, if you guys want to review the report, it's in there.

596
00:49:08,590 --> 00:49:11,272
Um, you know, it's, uh, it's.

597
00:49:12,693 --> 00:49:19,076
just so you guys know, the people that do the restoration work will take photos of every stone that they work on both before and after.

598
00:49:19,116 --> 00:49:22,158
So that's why they didn't document, photo document every stone.

599
00:49:22,178 --> 00:49:25,759
I do have photo documentation for every stone.

600
00:49:25,779 --> 00:49:32,163
So I kind of did that work ahead of time, but that's why it's lacking in photographs.

601
00:49:32,223 --> 00:49:36,305
It's just representatives just for the people's understanding of the scope of work.

602
00:49:36,325 --> 00:49:38,886
Again, this is,

603
00:49:42,875 --> 00:49:46,977
not intended to be anything other than, again, a point of information.

604
00:49:47,437 --> 00:49:52,158
How many of the stones there have families which are still traceable or known?

605
00:49:53,899 --> 00:49:55,060
That are living here?

606
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:01,642
At least that they saw the picture, at least they'd have somebody to send the picture to.

607
00:50:02,491 --> 00:50:04,553
I mean, I don't know.

608
00:50:04,573 --> 00:50:06,114
I don't know the answer to that.

609
00:50:06,194 --> 00:50:07,775
I know people do visit the stones.

610
00:50:09,296 --> 00:50:18,443
I've seen, I know directly that there are at least two people whose, it's a husband and wife team who have relatives buried in the cemetery.

611
00:50:19,723 --> 00:50:25,888
Other people have visited the stones because they leave little pebbles on top of the stone, which is a surefire indicator that people have been there.

612
00:50:27,445 --> 00:50:29,125
I have living descendants.

613
00:50:29,686 --> 00:50:32,627
I am a living descendant of some of those people that are in that cemetery.

614
00:50:32,767 --> 00:50:36,490
So it's one of the reasons why I started the project.

615
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:42,193
So, you know, there are people who are interested on reading through Reddit.

616
00:50:42,713 --> 00:50:49,357
Not that Reddit's a credible source, but reading through Reddit, at least one person said that they were related to people buried in Cross Street Cemetery.

617
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:52,100
I don't know.

618
00:50:52,601 --> 00:50:56,624
They certainly don't know how recent, but there are definitely descendants around.

619
00:50:56,644 --> 00:51:05,130
Any other questions?

620
00:51:07,612 --> 00:51:08,713
OK, so that's that.

621
00:51:11,755 --> 00:51:12,215
I guess I'll.

622
00:51:12,556 --> 00:51:13,096
Jen, you're muted.

623
00:51:13,116 --> 00:51:18,340
And move on to Cross Street.

624
00:51:19,286 --> 00:51:19,946
Yeah, the other one.

625
00:51:20,206 --> 00:51:23,408
Yeah, so we had the other one session just so everybody's aware.

626
00:51:23,428 --> 00:51:26,709
Just in case there's any confusion on that, because we don't need to.

627
00:51:26,729 --> 00:51:34,493
The mayor sent out a press release on Thursday, letting the general public know that we, um,

628
00:51:35,971 --> 00:51:51,139
we meaning the public archaeological laboratory, the archaeologists, conducted an archaeological dig on a 150-foot trench in the former Cross Street Cemetery parcel opposite City Hall.

629
00:51:51,920 --> 00:52:04,947
And we, I think it's pretty clear that there were items that were found there, both artifacts and skeletal remains, and that the whole parcel will need to be checked.

630
00:52:09,274 --> 00:52:10,374
for additional burials.

631
00:52:11,435 --> 00:52:24,702
I think what was the specifics, I can't really talk much about the specifics, but it was pretty intense to see that site open.

632
00:52:25,062 --> 00:52:31,365
And so based on what we found in the ground there is probably a,

633
00:52:34,662 --> 00:52:41,824
On a realistic schedule, probably that project will probably occupy the next three years of our time.

634
00:52:43,085 --> 00:52:55,209
We have the city's complete attention and the city will hopefully take the charge and take designate staff support to keep that project moving right along.

635
00:52:56,329 --> 00:53:00,611
But there's gonna be a really intense project there.

636
00:53:00,631 --> 00:53:03,112
And I think there's,

637
00:53:05,362 --> 00:53:06,683
that we're going to learn some things.

638
00:53:07,824 --> 00:53:15,190
And I think the community's going to have to sort of reckon with its past a little bit there, so.

639
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:24,997
Ryan, I don't know if you can answer this, but will they just take it in sections as they clear the site?

640
00:53:25,098 --> 00:53:26,519
If you can't answer that, that's OK.

641
00:53:27,063 --> 00:53:38,381
Yeah, I think it really depends on the methodology for recovery, but I think he the I think they'll probably end up given the so the the site is covered with.

642
00:53:39,913 --> 00:53:50,281
you have the historic grade, and then there's two layers of 12 inches of sand, and then there's the parking lot asphalt that's on top of it, another six inches or so.

643
00:53:51,082 --> 00:53:57,026
And there's a ton of clearing that needs to take place in order to conduct an archaeological dig there.

644
00:53:57,146 --> 00:54:08,415
So I think that it probably would be the most prudent use of funding to just clear the whole site down to historic grade and then just

645
00:54:09,656 --> 00:54:13,040
check what needs to be checked in a section at a time.

646
00:54:15,342 --> 00:54:21,930
The actual work on site will probably take up to four months, depending on how well weather is and cooperates.

647
00:54:22,851 --> 00:54:25,374
But then there's a lot of testing.

648
00:54:26,155 --> 00:54:29,638
Once stuff comes out of the ground, there's laboratory work.

649
00:54:30,395 --> 00:54:42,199
there may be anthropological investigation, and then there is the procedure on what happens to what we pull out of the ground and where it goes after the fact.

650
00:54:43,419 --> 00:54:45,040
And that has not been determined yet.

651
00:54:46,343 --> 00:54:47,364
It hasn't, but it will.

652
00:54:48,005 --> 00:54:53,289
So the PAL will be finishing their report based on the one trench that we dug.

653
00:54:54,189 --> 00:54:58,092
And they will take that information and send it to the state.

654
00:54:58,573 --> 00:55:03,276
The state will lay out parameters for what needs to happen to that site.

655
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:09,801
And the city will have to work with a series of stakeholders to bring them all to the table.

656
00:55:09,861 --> 00:55:14,625
And we'll all have to collectively discuss the next steps and go from there.

657
00:55:15,496 --> 00:55:24,918
There'll be a lot of discussion going on because there's both the city, the state, MassDOT.

658
00:55:26,859 --> 00:55:35,561
And for all intents and purposes, just so everybody's aware, state funding may be at play here to help with this project.

659
00:55:35,621 --> 00:55:40,642
But also, there are environmental reviews and environmental permitting that would be necessary.

660
00:55:43,092 --> 00:55:52,276
MHC, meaning the Massachusetts Historical Commission would have review over impacts to historic resources at that time as part of the section 106 reviews.

661
00:55:53,176 --> 00:55:57,078
And this information would have come to light then.

662
00:55:57,098 --> 00:56:06,242
So we are just saving ourselves and the city almost a year of time by working on this project ahead of that review, potential review, right?

663
00:56:06,282 --> 00:56:09,263
So it'll all be handled with the project that's planned for there.

664
00:56:09,283 --> 00:56:09,343
So-

665
00:56:13,152 --> 00:56:16,354
It seems there are two pieces, which I would be somewhat concerned about.

666
00:56:16,454 --> 00:56:22,377
One is bluntly money, because this is not going to be cheap.

667
00:56:22,417 --> 00:56:23,498
This is not going to be cheap.

668
00:56:24,379 --> 00:56:41,388
And two, it's the context of the RFPs for the redevelopment of that area, which if it's city property, again, becomes at least a short, both short and long term money, a money issue of when is development going to, how much,

669
00:56:41,908 --> 00:56:48,372
How much will this delay perspective development of what looks like a parking lot to those who didn't live in the city before 1980?

670
00:56:48,712 --> 00:57:09,926
Yeah, and I can't speak for the timeline for development, but I mean, I know that's most likely a ways off, but you know, I think it's important that the, you know, the site be checked and that we

671
00:57:11,647 --> 00:57:14,708
acknowledge what happened, happened and correct it.

672
00:57:14,948 --> 00:57:20,230
I think it's, you know, we can, we can, I, I have no, no, I, I, I have no qualms with that.

673
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:21,691
I'm not the guy who's going to have the qualms.

674
00:57:23,391 --> 00:57:26,292
I do believe that money, uh, you know, money will be an issue.

675
00:57:26,312 --> 00:57:32,695
Uh, hopefully the, the, there'll be a multitude of funding sources that might help with this project.

676
00:57:34,535 --> 00:57:39,557
So Ryan, just, um, can you refresh us on,

677
00:57:40,245 --> 00:57:48,188
I mean, there's the area of the cemetery that's located where this city hall, that parking lot is now.

678
00:57:49,469 --> 00:57:53,751
But how far did the Cross Street Cemetery extend under what is now 93?

679
00:57:54,431 --> 00:58:05,676
So the property line extends over to the northbound side Route 60 exit ramp on the opposite side of the highway.

680
00:58:06,156 --> 00:58:07,977
So it's under the entire embankment.

681
00:58:12,338 --> 00:58:16,662
So that could be really complicated.

682
00:58:16,722 --> 00:58:17,642
I have the map.

683
00:58:17,662 --> 00:58:18,924
Can I share my screen?

684
00:58:18,964 --> 00:58:20,064
Am I allowed to share my screen?

685
00:58:20,605 --> 00:58:22,026
Yeah, I think it's fair.

686
00:58:22,066 --> 00:58:23,868
Let me show it.

687
00:58:24,028 --> 00:58:28,371
There's no proprietary information that's not available to the general public there.

688
00:58:30,133 --> 00:58:31,574
Can you guys see that?

689
00:58:33,416 --> 00:58:36,538
And then, so this is the spot right now that we can access.

690
00:58:39,544 --> 00:58:45,346
So they're only gonna go as far, they're not going past this area, right?

691
00:58:45,866 --> 00:58:50,068
Yeah, there's gonna be some discussion with MassDOT because- To go a little farther.

692
00:58:50,088 --> 00:58:54,429
Yeah, invariably there'll be things that cross the line there.

693
00:58:54,489 --> 00:59:01,311
So I, there'll need to be some cooperation, but how much is up in the air?

694
00:59:02,812 --> 00:59:06,193
So, yeah, so just, you know,

695
00:59:08,178 --> 00:59:11,079
So, can you scroll up and show the history?

696
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:15,882
Yeah, hold on.

697
00:59:16,062 --> 00:59:17,283
Let me share my screen.

698
00:59:17,583 --> 00:59:25,747
I do just think it's important that people understand that the site around City Hall is virtually unrecognizable to what it was in the.

699
00:59:26,662 --> 00:59:28,883
in the early 20th century.

700
00:59:29,024 --> 00:59:39,570
So this is a view of the site, and the railroad is to the right, and the City Hall, the corners of City Hall are where they are.

701
00:59:39,831 --> 00:59:44,574
And that, no, that's actually the Washington School on Cross Street.

702
00:59:44,694 --> 00:59:48,956
It's down below where the two men are standing, those are the corners of City Hall.

703
00:59:49,096 --> 00:59:53,019
They're actually, they're staking out the corners of City Hall on that site.

704
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:55,981
And so then this is the parking lot right here.

705
01:00:00,446 --> 01:00:03,807
So yeah.

706
01:00:04,387 --> 01:00:04,927
Fascinating.

707
01:00:05,648 --> 01:00:05,908
Yeah.

708
01:00:05,948 --> 01:00:08,228
Well, thank you for all your hard work on that, Ryan.

709
01:00:08,749 --> 01:00:09,029
Thanks.

710
01:00:09,429 --> 01:00:14,150
The city's, I think, going to keep moving on it.

711
01:00:14,170 --> 01:00:17,471
They're dedicated to moving the project forward.

712
01:00:17,491 --> 01:00:19,192
So we will see.

713
01:00:20,481 --> 01:00:24,784
Brian, is it worth mentioning that this is not the city of Medford's error?

714
01:00:24,804 --> 01:00:27,005
I mean, it was the state, right?

715
01:00:27,065 --> 01:00:30,688
I mean, I think the state should pay for the mistake even if it's 70 years later.

716
01:00:30,708 --> 01:00:37,012
I don't know why the city of Medford should have to spend a whole lot of money uncovering this.

717
01:00:37,372 --> 01:00:41,194
Once we figure out the scope of the cost of this, it's gonna go on forever.

718
01:00:41,234 --> 01:00:42,795
It's gonna cost a fortune to do this.

719
01:00:43,836 --> 01:00:47,558
So I am of the opinion rather than

720
01:00:49,438 --> 01:01:10,528
In looking back, I think the correct thing to say is that the methodologies that were conducted in the middle of the 19th, middle of the 20th century, even even You know, even for cemetery removals are vastly different than what they are today.

721
01:01:10,548 --> 01:01:11,188
They there's no

722
01:01:14,613 --> 01:01:18,815
There were no major environmental reviews.

723
01:01:18,855 --> 01:01:25,099
There's no reviews for historic resources during that time period of highway construction.

724
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:34,865
And I think things have changed quite a bit in the 70 or so years that we have been

725
01:01:35,753 --> 01:01:42,375
you know, working on historic preservation and making it an important part of both state and federal projects.

726
01:01:42,635 --> 01:01:47,236
So I don't think it's fair to say or blame the state.

727
01:01:47,476 --> 01:01:55,258
I think the important thing here is to acknowledge that what's there is there and that we just need to move forward.

728
01:01:55,758 --> 01:02:05,620
And I would, you know, I would hope that maybe the state would contribute given that they did work on it, but there's no guarantee that they will.

729
01:02:12,404 --> 01:02:24,050
But I mean, when the time comes and the formal request is made, it would be great to call your local politicians and put in a good word that we need this funding.

730
01:02:24,090 --> 01:02:29,414
There will need to be state approval for additional work, so it will hit the legislature.

731
01:02:29,494 --> 01:02:31,715
So that will be the time to advocate.

732
01:02:36,682 --> 01:02:38,443
All right, anything else on this topic?

733
01:02:38,523 --> 01:02:39,464
Otherwise, we'll move on.

734
01:02:39,484 --> 01:02:46,929
Okay, moving on to old business, unless anybody else has anything that's new that I'm not aware of.

735
01:02:50,271 --> 01:02:53,133
Okay, moving on to old business.

736
01:02:53,573 --> 01:02:55,995
Preservation ordinance discussion, Ryan?

737
01:02:57,030 --> 01:03:00,032
I would like to pull together a list.

738
01:03:00,092 --> 01:03:02,092
So I'd like to table this for next month.

739
01:03:02,152 --> 01:03:09,015
I did send out a little thing saying Jen Doherty from Mass Historical sent me a bunch of bylaws.

740
01:03:09,075 --> 01:03:14,878
I just want to take the time tonight to read through them, summarize them for the commission and go from there.

741
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:24,442
And then I didn't hear back from the Reddings yet on meeting to review how well their ordinances are working, but there may be other communities that we want to reach out to.

742
01:03:25,583 --> 01:03:37,622
We might wanna think about tabling this to March just because next month is gonna be chock full, but we can see if any, you know, what else comes in and then make a decision when we do the agenda.

743
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:38,848
Yeah, that sounds good.

744
01:03:38,908 --> 01:03:45,412
I think I'll send out between now and then just like a summary and we can really have a discussion.

745
01:03:45,452 --> 01:03:56,539
And actually, does it make sense to have, and this is just for like the whole commission poising, does it make sense to have like a separate meeting just to review the ordinances and then maybe review the ADU information?

746
01:03:57,640 --> 01:03:59,021
Because it should be out by then.

747
01:03:59,141 --> 01:04:04,825
So, and Jen, you should have something and maybe the guidelines.

748
01:04:05,431 --> 01:04:12,537
Yeah, let's regroup on this when we are putting the agenda in and then we'll make the call when to do that and if to do it separately.

749
01:04:12,557 --> 01:04:15,239
Okay.

750
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:18,362
Cool.

751
01:04:18,502 --> 01:04:18,902
Okay.

752
01:04:19,042 --> 01:04:23,166
Okay, so 27 Allmont is the only thing under demo delay right now.

753
01:04:24,747 --> 01:04:34,035
They have indicated that they want to wait out the delay unless anybody wants to try to reengage them between now and November.

754
01:04:35,346 --> 01:04:39,768
I wonder if we want to maybe put some money into documentation.

755
01:04:39,788 --> 01:04:42,649
I don't know who would be doing documentation.

756
01:04:42,709 --> 01:04:47,631
Myron, when I last spoke with him back at the end of the year, he was quite busy.

757
01:04:48,491 --> 01:04:49,532
So maybe we can find

758
01:04:50,650 --> 01:04:56,033
maybe we can partner up with PAL or somebody else to do this type of work.

759
01:04:56,073 --> 01:04:59,834
Maybe sometimes John and Claire will find time for it.

760
01:04:59,954 --> 01:05:09,679
But I was just curious if we think that we should put some money into this project just to document it if we know it's coming down.

761
01:05:13,086 --> 01:05:17,310
Or do folks want to try to re-approach him about moving forward in some way?

762
01:05:17,410 --> 01:05:21,153
I'm assuming that he just doesn't want to save the building at all, so.

763
01:05:21,934 --> 01:05:26,318
Ryan, could you put a form B or something on the screen so we can get an image of what we're talking about?

764
01:05:26,358 --> 01:05:28,259
It's been a while since I thought about this one.

765
01:05:30,261 --> 01:05:34,084
It's the blue house, right?

766
01:05:34,104 --> 01:05:34,505
Yeah.

767
01:05:34,625 --> 01:05:36,086
Hold on.

768
01:05:37,487 --> 01:05:40,530
I don't think he had, from talking to him, I don't think he had any,

769
01:05:43,373 --> 01:05:45,455
desire to engage with us at all.

770
01:05:46,696 --> 01:05:47,937
That was my feeling.

771
01:05:48,057 --> 01:05:53,281
Although he sort of hinted that he would, but kind of felt like he was just saying that to get out of the meeting.

772
01:05:54,582 --> 01:05:56,824
I know this is coming back to me.

773
01:05:56,864 --> 01:05:58,045
This is the one we had.

774
01:05:58,745 --> 01:05:59,086
Yeah.

775
01:05:59,526 --> 01:06:00,347
Yeah.

776
01:06:01,288 --> 01:06:11,356
And he didn't, you know, I just didn't think he, he didn't really understand where we were coming from.

777
01:06:11,436 --> 01:06:12,397
I don't think so.

778
01:06:12,497 --> 01:06:12,797
I don't know.

779
01:06:13,478 --> 01:06:18,202
It's an early building, so I would like to see some documentation, especially if it's vacant.

780
01:06:18,562 --> 01:06:19,463
I'm assuming it's vacant.

781
01:06:19,883 --> 01:06:25,507
And especially if we can do some digging into this building.

782
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:42,521
So why don't I maybe come up with, he's in it until November, so why don't I come up with a cost to spend and see if we can't get some documentation for this building, maybe started in April sometime, April, May.

783
01:06:44,390 --> 01:06:57,218
Yeah, I think it would be good if we could, it's unfortunate that they won't engage with us because I think there is a way to blend old and new here.

784
01:06:57,238 --> 01:07:04,322
I mean, Sid seems to have figured out a way to blend old and new.

785
01:07:05,803 --> 01:07:10,426
And even like Nelson has, we've done some recent projects and

786
01:07:12,058 --> 01:07:20,041
It's just unfortunate that there is no, you know, they don't want to, but I guess that's their right, obviously, so.

787
01:07:23,261 --> 01:07:33,385
It does feel like, though, I mean, for something like this, where it seems like it's just going to be leveled and there's no interest in trying to preserve any of it.

788
01:07:34,085 --> 01:07:41,547
I mean, we should have documentation and some sort of a, you know, a dictionary of the buildings that

789
01:07:41,954 --> 01:07:42,654
are just gone.

790
01:07:44,175 --> 01:07:48,537
I mean, there's, you know, 10 months, right?

791
01:07:48,617 --> 01:07:51,278
So do, I mean, do we want to try for a historic district?

792
01:07:51,358 --> 01:07:53,339
I don't, I mean, they passed cell street.

793
01:07:53,919 --> 01:07:55,760
So that meaning city council passed cell street.

794
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:58,181
So they've already got a precedent, but I don't know.

795
01:07:58,201 --> 01:08:01,802
I don't know whether this one would pass.

796
01:08:02,083 --> 01:08:03,803
It's a little bit of a harder sell.

797
01:08:03,863 --> 01:08:05,444
It's not, you know, it's by itself.

798
01:08:06,344 --> 01:08:10,046
I mean, it isn't really good condition, but it's also still by itself though.

799
01:08:12,484 --> 01:08:15,345
But I mean, I can start with documentation and see where we can go.

800
01:08:15,385 --> 01:08:17,426
Who is running the district commission these days?

801
01:08:17,446 --> 01:08:21,868
Is it even possible to get this done?

802
01:08:21,888 --> 01:08:30,492
I think it would be if they hire a consultant to just do the report, because we already have the form B. They just have to justify the boundaries, which is simply it's under delay.

803
01:08:30,532 --> 01:08:32,132
The owner's not willing to engage.

804
01:08:32,553 --> 01:08:37,555
And then it's up to the city council to see if they'll take it.

805
01:08:42,023 --> 01:08:49,346
I mean, I feel like we should pass it along to the district commission and then they should look at it themselves and see if.

806
01:08:49,966 --> 01:08:50,606
Yeah, I guess I can.

807
01:08:50,706 --> 01:08:54,888
I guess we can see if I can get on the agenda and say here's this building.

808
01:08:55,288 --> 01:08:58,709
If you want to proceed with a single house historic district, here's a good opportunity.

809
01:08:59,289 --> 01:09:06,672
We're going to move forward with documentation of the building as if it's coming down, but you can use that to justify further to save it.

810
01:09:08,352 --> 01:09:09,553
If it becomes important, OK.

811
01:09:10,358 --> 01:09:16,182
Yeah, I mean, I feel like that's their that it's almost that that's their purview, not ours.

812
01:09:16,282 --> 01:09:16,502
And yeah.

813
01:09:17,202 --> 01:09:29,530
I would say that I think we could probably sorry, Kit, we probably are on consensus that we would we would not we would support a historic district there if they want to move forward with it.

814
01:09:29,590 --> 01:09:31,792
But, you know, it is their it is their purview.

815
01:09:31,832 --> 01:09:33,253
So it kind of give them the

816
01:09:34,992 --> 01:09:44,322
I mean, do we have, like, under the 18-month demo delay, I know one of the steps is, like, documentation and whatever.

817
01:09:45,784 --> 01:09:56,655
Is there an automatic, like, we're going to refer this to the district commission for a single house historic or a district to be created if something's under demo delay and the property owner is not willing to work with us?

818
01:09:57,575 --> 01:09:58,576
I don't think it well.

819
01:09:59,336 --> 01:10:00,537
I think it depends on the case.

820
01:10:00,717 --> 01:10:01,858
I don't think it's automatic.

821
01:10:01,998 --> 01:10:10,684
If the property owner is not willing to work with us, I think we should make a conscious decision to advocate and say the moment that you say you're not going to, you're just going to sit on your hands.

822
01:10:10,724 --> 01:10:24,453
We're going to advocate for a local historic district to further, you know, slow this for the buildings that we, you know, if you, if it's preferably preserved and it's significant, then obviously we should probably advocate for that.

823
01:10:24,654 --> 01:10:26,535
But, uh, you know,

824
01:10:27,257 --> 01:10:31,318
I don't know, it really is on a case by case basis.

825
01:10:33,579 --> 01:10:41,562
In this case, I think that the house could be saved even, you know, and get the unit there and then some, so.

826
01:10:43,403 --> 01:10:53,046
I guess I disagree with the idea that if somebody, that every time somebody refuses to work with us, we try to impose a,

827
01:10:54,214 --> 01:10:55,415
to our district on the house.

828
01:10:55,736 --> 01:10:58,599
I don't feel that's the right approach.

829
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:07,229
That makes that a tool, not really a strategic way of thinking about that in the city.

830
01:11:07,289 --> 01:11:08,891
I just don't think that's the right approach.

831
01:11:10,413 --> 01:11:10,653
Right.

832
01:11:10,713 --> 01:11:13,576
And to build off of what Doug is saying, I think it's more important

833
01:11:14,642 --> 01:11:25,601
rather than to force somebody to work with us, to actually work on giving ourselves the tools necessary to help

834
01:11:27,447 --> 01:11:33,192
know basically give ourselves more tools so that we can work with the zoning board to give zoning relief for historic preservation projects.

835
01:11:33,232 --> 01:11:44,602
That's why that those changes are so important because we basically say okay yeah it's not feasible right now but now we we have this new ordinance that we passed that will help give the

836
01:11:45,583 --> 01:11:51,445
zoning relief to you so you can get the project on here and keep the existing house, provided you're willing to keep the existing house.

837
01:11:51,865 --> 01:12:03,129
You know, not every building is worthy of saving, you know, not every building can be saved, but we can try to do our best to kind of save enough of them that the Metro doesn't lose its historic charm.

838
01:12:03,149 --> 01:12:08,831
I mean, I think just from, I mean, I agree with Doug and

839
01:12:10,740 --> 01:12:17,404
I also think there is, you know, the fact of the matter is we're the only ones who are having this conversation about this house.

840
01:12:18,265 --> 01:12:27,931
And insofar as the historic district commission is another body to have to have the conversation about the house feels like the right thing.

841
01:12:27,971 --> 01:12:28,571
I mean, it's like

842
01:12:33,525 --> 01:12:43,867
if there are such limited tools that we have in terms of preservation of these kinds of buildings, it seems like we should at least open the conversation to a broader constituency.

843
01:12:43,887 --> 01:12:50,649
I mean, whether the Historic District Commission decides to do anything or not, I mean, I doubt they would, but.

844
01:12:50,669 --> 01:12:57,790
I feel like we should at least refer it to them and then, because, you know,

845
01:12:59,146 --> 01:13:01,747
Nobody from their commission comes to our meetings.

846
01:13:02,287 --> 01:13:05,829
I don't know how much they're paying attention to our agendas.

847
01:13:05,909 --> 01:13:19,154
So unless we share with them what's kind of happening, what we're seeing, I don't know how they're tackling their agendas, what their goals are every year, anything.

848
01:13:19,194 --> 01:13:23,376
I mean, I know that board's been in a little bit of a disarray for a while.

849
01:13:24,757 --> 01:13:27,678
So I would love, maybe this is an opportunity to

850
01:13:28,658 --> 01:13:30,859
have a working relationship with that board.

851
01:13:31,079 --> 01:13:36,241
And I mean, I'd love to see somebody kind of check in with us monthly, say, hey, what's going on?

852
01:13:36,261 --> 01:13:37,581
What do we need to be aware of?

853
01:13:37,741 --> 01:13:43,903
Where can we, is there anything that is of particular importance that we should start looking at?

854
01:13:45,486 --> 01:13:54,548
Yeah, I think Jess from the same department as Dennis staffs their board.

855
01:13:54,568 --> 01:13:58,249
I would like to think there's some communication inter-office.

856
01:13:58,309 --> 01:14:03,430
So there should be a way to get information on the ins and outs of the board.

857
01:14:03,470 --> 01:14:09,011
But yes, I think it's good to have collaborative conversations and have them come talk to us, et cetera.

858
01:14:09,031 --> 01:14:12,372
Yeah.

859
01:14:12,968 --> 01:14:19,972
Actually, Ryan, just to jump in, Jess moved back to California, so Teresa is now staffing Historic District.

860
01:14:20,472 --> 01:14:20,652
Nope.

861
01:14:20,893 --> 01:14:21,193
Awesome.

862
01:14:21,313 --> 01:14:21,573
All right.

863
01:14:21,653 --> 01:14:28,777
Well, then tomorrow I will reach out to Teresa and see if I can get on their agenda.

864
01:14:29,538 --> 01:14:32,819
Do you know, Dennis, if they're having a meeting this month?

865
01:14:35,941 --> 01:14:37,222
Honestly, I don't know.

866
01:14:38,163 --> 01:14:38,803
OK.

867
01:14:38,843 --> 01:14:41,585
I know she was talking to the new chair, so.

868
01:14:43,036 --> 01:14:43,937
Who is the chair?

869
01:14:46,358 --> 01:14:46,698
Do you know?

870
01:14:46,718 --> 01:14:53,783
Honestly, I'm not 100% sure.

871
01:14:53,803 --> 01:14:55,184
She just said the new chair.

872
01:14:55,324 --> 01:14:56,004
We'll follow up.

873
01:14:59,867 --> 01:15:00,387
No problem.

874
01:15:00,487 --> 01:15:01,568
We'll follow up on our end.

875
01:15:02,108 --> 01:15:02,568
Thank you.

876
01:15:05,990 --> 01:15:08,092
All right, Ryan, you can check in with Teresa on that one.

877
01:15:08,732 --> 01:15:08,992
I will.

878
01:15:09,493 --> 01:15:09,753
Thank you.

879
01:15:11,899 --> 01:15:12,559
Hi, Doug.

880
01:15:12,619 --> 01:15:13,320
Nice to see you.

881
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:15,601
Glad you got your Zoom working.

882
01:15:17,081 --> 01:15:18,002
It's my new laptop.

883
01:15:20,063 --> 01:15:21,443
Zoom didn't exist.

884
01:15:21,463 --> 01:15:25,125
I had to recreate Zoom from scratch.

885
01:15:25,645 --> 01:15:28,606
Ryan, are there any more Form Bs we need to order?

886
01:15:28,666 --> 01:15:29,246
Do we need to?

887
01:15:29,306 --> 01:15:29,686
We're good?

888
01:15:29,787 --> 01:15:30,067
Okay.

889
01:15:30,507 --> 01:15:31,267
No, I think we're good.

890
01:15:31,367 --> 01:15:32,027
I think I'll

891
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:42,465
spend like a budget of like $2,000 to $5,000 for the documentation effort and see where I get for that.

892
01:15:43,345 --> 01:15:43,646
Okay.

893
01:15:45,947 --> 01:15:52,451
Maybe, does it make sense to put it out on like the preservation boards and see maybe there's somebody new out there that can help us?

894
01:15:53,011 --> 01:15:56,994
Well, I'll reach out to... Maybe Eleni knows somebody too?

895
01:15:57,974 --> 01:15:58,635
Yeah.

896
01:15:58,775 --> 01:15:59,876
Oh yeah, yeah, it's possible.

897
01:15:59,996 --> 01:16:00,696
I mean, I will...

898
01:16:03,206 --> 01:16:18,913
I will reach out and see about forms and other stuff, but there's always so many people that do the really in-depth stuff, like looking at nails and whatnot, and do it well.

899
01:16:19,333 --> 01:16:22,955
So we'll see about availability too as well.

900
01:16:24,095 --> 01:16:24,375
Okay.

901
01:16:26,236 --> 01:16:30,098
I don't see any meetings on the city calendar for this month or next month.

902
01:16:31,998 --> 01:16:33,319
historic district commission.

903
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,721
That doesn't necessarily mean that there isn't one, but.

904
01:16:38,102 --> 01:16:41,083
I don't know that they pre-populate a calendar like we do.

905
01:16:42,164 --> 01:16:43,465
I've seen them on there before.

906
01:16:43,685 --> 01:16:47,347
I've seen their meetings on the calendars before in previous years, but.

907
01:16:48,728 --> 01:16:50,088
I mean, they might not show up till 48 hours before.

908
01:16:52,669 --> 01:16:54,792
No, usually they do a pretty good job.

909
01:16:54,812 --> 01:17:03,706
But yes, I think maybe one of the things that Teresa can work with them on is actually pre-populating their URLs so that they can meet on a monthly basis.

910
01:17:04,146 --> 01:17:04,307
Yeah.

911
01:17:05,218 --> 01:17:10,279
Yeah, maybe it's just because they haven't had that scheduling meeting yet.

912
01:17:11,339 --> 01:17:12,719
Yeah.

913
01:17:12,779 --> 01:17:17,000
We send our dates to Dennis so that it's on the calendar.

914
01:17:17,020 --> 01:17:19,041
Then they just have to link the agenda when they get it.

915
01:17:19,681 --> 01:17:20,801
But it's already there.

916
01:17:21,661 --> 01:17:21,881
Right.

917
01:17:21,941 --> 01:17:23,902
I don't know that every board and commission does that.

918
01:17:25,522 --> 01:17:28,022
Yeah, they do have four new members.

919
01:17:30,163 --> 01:17:31,363
You may not know what's going on.

920
01:17:32,232 --> 01:17:34,883
Well, yeah, I mean, it's just that it's a new year for them, that's all.

921
01:17:37,169 --> 01:17:42,491
Okay, permitting is moving along.

922
01:17:42,511 --> 01:17:49,094
I have a bunch of things on hold right now in our queue, just asking for elevations and confirmation of work.

923
01:17:49,834 --> 01:17:57,057
I'm sending those around to Peter, Doug, and Eleni as I get things that need kind of a cohesive discussion on.

924
01:18:00,899 --> 01:18:03,660
So that is kind of moving along there, nothing,

925
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:06,180
really, nothing really new to report.

926
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:12,982
Although, I guess my report is that, you know, there's a lot in our queue.

927
01:18:13,022 --> 01:18:16,203
So projects are definitely ramping up.

928
01:18:16,503 --> 01:18:30,306
So I'm taking that as a good sign for, you know, this year in terms of, you know, housing and renovations and people are just moving on with their lives and their projects.

929
01:18:34,226 --> 01:18:39,089
CPA, Thomas Brooks, Ryan, your note said we're getting a new archaeologist?

930
01:18:39,530 --> 01:18:51,657
Yeah, we have SWCA was the low qualified bidder for Thomas Brooks Park phase two archaeology work, so we will be working with them.

931
01:18:52,598 --> 01:18:58,461
Folks might remember Sue Anna Crowley from the Historical Commission years ago.

932
01:19:00,258 --> 01:19:02,920
I think more than a decade ago, if you can imagine.

933
01:19:04,021 --> 01:19:16,148
So she's now working with them, and that's how they got involved with that project and saw that we were issuing bids, and they're the low-qualified bidder.

934
01:19:16,188 --> 01:19:22,532
So we'll be working with them over the summer, hopefully, to do another community-oriented

935
01:19:23,897 --> 01:19:25,758
um sort of quasi-public dig.

936
01:19:26,738 --> 01:19:44,502
This time it's focused on the house site and a little learning a little bit more about the house but um you know the people can still contribute so and I think it will be longer it'll be a little bit longer of a dig so there'll be more opportunity for people to contribute we just I think we can find a way maybe to uh

937
01:19:45,868 --> 01:19:59,413
you know, once we have a volunteer list to get people to basically create a list of dates and let them sign up for it and then, you know, do the lottery at the very end and say, okay, if there's too many people on a specific day, you're going to get called at a lottery, you know?

938
01:20:01,414 --> 01:20:02,174
So exciting.

939
01:20:02,614 --> 01:20:02,894
Yeah.

940
01:20:03,014 --> 01:20:04,275
All this digging in Medford.

941
01:20:05,723 --> 01:20:14,008
Well, just so folks know, too, SWCA is the lead archaeologist monitoring the upcoming demolition of Walkling Court.

942
01:20:14,829 --> 01:20:17,691
So when that happens, they'll be here in Medford, too, as well.

943
01:20:17,851 --> 01:20:20,613
So they are not coming out of the blue.

944
01:20:20,673 --> 01:20:22,954
They do have and work locally.

945
01:20:22,974 --> 01:20:25,236
Great.

946
01:20:27,918 --> 01:20:29,979
Any update on surveys, Ryan?

947
01:20:31,855 --> 01:20:37,317
We got the purchase order for Sagamore Vale all squared away.

948
01:20:37,477 --> 01:20:40,159
We hired John and Claire to do that project.

949
01:20:41,940 --> 01:20:43,280
They were the low qualified bidder.

950
01:20:43,781 --> 01:20:44,741
We did have another bidder.

951
01:20:45,221 --> 01:20:55,727
He was not qualified to do the work, so we just moved forward with John and Claire, and they are looking forward to documenting that neighborhood.

952
01:20:55,747 --> 01:20:59,309
I am going to work on

953
01:20:59,979 --> 01:21:01,280
I was working on it a little bit earlier.

954
01:21:01,801 --> 01:21:06,805
The next survey and planning application for Hastings Heights.

955
01:21:07,505 --> 01:21:09,487
So we were invited back.

956
01:21:10,308 --> 01:21:13,490
Mass Historical apparently didn't have enough applications for their

957
01:21:16,406 --> 01:21:20,049
their annual pass through to certified local governments of which we are one.

958
01:21:20,549 --> 01:21:23,992
So they invited us back along with all the other CLGs.

959
01:21:24,072 --> 01:21:31,318
So it'll be a little bit more competitive than it has been in years past, but MHC has to pass that funding through.

960
01:21:31,378 --> 01:21:36,522
So I'm hoping that we might apply for a little bit more than we normally would.

961
01:21:38,102 --> 01:21:47,266
And added bonus is that it's a 60-40 match where Mass Historical will give 60 for every 40 that we contribute.

962
01:21:47,846 --> 01:21:53,468
So that's an up from our normal 50-50 match in recent years, which is great.

963
01:21:54,168 --> 01:21:56,209
So get a little bit more out of it.

964
01:21:59,470 --> 01:22:01,250
So that application's due in February.

965
01:22:01,290 --> 01:22:05,052
We usually know by April-ish if we're going to get that project.

966
01:22:06,942 --> 01:22:11,966
I will acknowledge that this will be my or that particular work.

967
01:22:12,567 --> 01:22:14,728
This will be my last survey and planning project.

968
01:22:15,529 --> 01:22:19,732
I would like to wrap that up and then we've gone through the city.

969
01:22:19,772 --> 01:22:21,854
We've spent more than a decade doing this work.

970
01:22:21,974 --> 01:22:23,975
So I would like to pass it on to

971
01:22:24,836 --> 01:22:28,017
some people to ideally continue that work.

972
01:22:28,077 --> 01:22:32,378
I think the city will continue to, as long as we have the budget for it, the city will continue.

973
01:22:32,418 --> 01:22:36,839
But I'm going to start wrapping up projects and that is among the first.

974
01:22:38,460 --> 01:22:51,263
Plus I think we also can maybe work on diversifying our consultants too over time just because people can only do work for so long.

975
01:22:51,283 --> 01:22:51,943
So

976
01:22:52,577 --> 01:22:54,217
people only want to work for so long.

977
01:22:54,377 --> 01:23:06,540
So, you know, we might try to intersprinkle some new folks to, not that we're not pleased with their work, just, you know, to get people used to working at Medford and having fun digging into the history here.

978
01:23:09,121 --> 01:23:09,461
Excellent.

979
01:23:11,242 --> 01:23:11,522
Okay.

980
01:23:11,902 --> 01:23:17,283
Does anybody have anything else for tonight before we move on to meeting minutes and wrapping up?

981
01:23:18,733 --> 01:23:28,577
Just one thing, Jenna, you and I talked about the whole, the tough storm that's currently becoming quite a scene in Medford, at least in the hillside.

982
01:23:29,417 --> 01:23:37,640
It's just, I think I was away when this came before, I think I was on vacation, I might've missed a meeting.

983
01:23:37,660 --> 01:23:43,862
And we're allowed to comment on any project that comes before the city, whether it's historic or not.

984
01:23:44,002 --> 01:23:47,544
And I think we should try to take every opportunity we can for

985
01:23:48,884 --> 01:23:50,945
to do that, especially for the larger projects.

986
01:23:50,965 --> 01:24:07,309
And if anyone's interested at the end of this meeting, when we're done, I can show people what Tufts is proposing, which is a 10 story building on Boston Avenue, pretty tight against the streets, which is infuriating the Hillside neighborhood right now.

987
01:24:07,389 --> 01:24:16,192
And it's becoming a major political battle right now with Tufts, which I don't like that, because it's not good for the city, not good for Tufts, it's not good for anyone.

988
01:24:17,332 --> 01:24:23,674
So we're trying to figure out a compromise, but this group can have a voice in that.

989
01:24:23,834 --> 01:24:29,416
And the more we do, I think the better we connect to the rest of the city, just as going forward, that's all.

990
01:24:30,116 --> 01:24:37,018
It's not a critique of anyone or myself or like we just, we didn't come to the game and now the game's kind of gotten out of hand a little bit.

991
01:24:37,878 --> 01:24:41,179
And I think if we'd intervened earlier, it may have been better.

992
01:24:45,312 --> 01:24:45,554
OK.

993
01:24:46,642 --> 01:24:47,489
Thank you for that comment.

994
01:24:50,347 --> 01:24:52,067
Okay, does anybody have anything else?

995
01:24:53,008 --> 01:24:54,148
Brian, did you want to say something?

996
01:24:54,488 --> 01:25:10,452
Yeah, do we want to... City's undertaking all of these, apparently a series of zoning changes that are getting some attention to like along the Mystic Ave corridor and Salem Street.

997
01:25:10,573 --> 01:25:15,074
Do we want to request that the planning department just keep us

998
01:25:16,557 --> 01:25:34,232
in the loop because I think they're missing the opportunity to have input from the historical commission for both input on the existing landscape and input to the proposed changes that they're thinking about making.

999
01:25:34,392 --> 01:25:37,595
And some of these proposals are more advanced than others.

1000
01:25:37,655 --> 01:25:39,877
Apparently the one on Salem Street, which I had

1001
01:25:40,557 --> 01:25:51,184
no idea was working its way through the approval process until fairly recently when some community members have become active in raising an awareness of it.

1002
01:25:52,324 --> 01:26:06,633
Some of the changes are rather drastic and it would result maybe in the obliteration of the existing landscape by significantly upzoning the area where you could almost double or triple the intensity of

1003
01:26:08,156 --> 01:26:08,877
number of units.

1004
01:26:09,197 --> 01:26:24,586
So I wonder if we just want to maybe reach out to the planning department and just say, hey, can you just, you know, CC us on some of these major meetings, we're happy to come, we're happy to provide comments, you know, on proposed plans.

1005
01:26:25,047 --> 01:26:32,571
And, you know, just so we don't, you know, we're not blindsided, so we don't blindside them, everybody's on a collaborative nature.

1006
01:26:32,611 --> 01:26:33,812
I think that's sort of important.

1007
01:26:35,121 --> 01:26:38,684
But it also, we'll circle back.

1008
01:26:39,305 --> 01:26:47,491
We really do need a city preservation planner, a full-time staff person who's just advocating for preservation in all aspects.

1009
01:26:47,531 --> 01:26:54,357
And that'd be one of the, I guess that's one of the major roles that's missing from the department.

1010
01:26:54,417 --> 01:26:58,321
And that one person can't staff all the boards, but it'd be great if they,

1011
01:27:00,383 --> 01:27:03,584
you know, we're not stretching people in a million different directions.

1012
01:27:04,524 --> 01:27:06,285
I think those are all good ideas, Ryan.

1013
01:27:06,305 --> 01:27:14,768
I think the city's zoning process is something that I haven't seen a lot of where they're basically entertaining.

1014
01:27:14,968 --> 01:27:18,970
Like, if you have an idea, I mean, I've been I've talked to the planning department because

1015
01:27:21,051 --> 01:27:34,840
I was curious where we were in the zoning process and it seems like if you have a plan for an area of the city and they think it's a good plan, they will kind of work with you to build the zoning around that.

1016
01:27:35,121 --> 01:27:37,722
Sometimes it's proactive, sometimes it's a little bit reactive.

1017
01:27:40,584 --> 01:27:50,147
There's pluses and minuses with both approaches, but your larger point about more transparency, more public eyes, more eyes on everything earlier is a good one.

1018
01:27:50,207 --> 01:28:03,932
And I 100% endorse, and we should obviously talk to Dennis and Teresa, everyone in the planning department is to see if we can be made aware, copied us on all the draft proposals

1019
01:28:04,712 --> 01:28:19,142
schedules and dates maps of the city what's done what's not done this is a multi-year process but it's not going to go on for 10 years it's going to go on for one or two more as my understanding recording stopped recording in progress sorry that was my bad

1020
01:28:21,808 --> 01:28:30,399
Yeah, I think yeah I do think, you know, I like I think of a neighboring Somerville right the very before they even changed it before they even entertained.

1021
01:28:31,881 --> 01:28:36,547
You know, changing the zoning they basically reached out to the community and started with a series of meetings saying.

1022
01:28:37,328 --> 01:28:41,151
you know, who, what, where, when, you know, like, what do you want to see?

1023
01:28:41,171 --> 01:28:42,773
You know, what's working, what's not working?

1024
01:28:43,013 --> 01:28:46,396
Just tell us even from a neighborhood by neighborhood basis.

1025
01:28:46,976 --> 01:28:51,900
And then they laid out a plan and then they brought that plan to the various communities again.

1026
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:54,422
And there was a lot of tightening up.

1027
01:28:54,502 --> 01:28:56,424
And then they came up with their master.

1028
01:28:56,884 --> 01:28:57,685
Here's our zoning.

1029
01:28:58,145 --> 01:28:59,146
It's the entire city.

1030
01:28:59,747 --> 01:29:00,547
We reworked it.

1031
01:29:01,028 --> 01:29:03,129
It was collaborative and out it went.

1032
01:29:03,950 --> 01:29:07,573
So, you know, Medford's a little bit more divided.

1033
01:29:07,993 --> 01:29:14,897
So I think, you know, I think it'd be a little bit tougher to do that, but it definitely should have that level of engagement.

1034
01:29:14,958 --> 01:29:24,784
Like, you know, I should not have to find out, you know, from a council meeting that approves the zoning, that the zoning change is going to happen.

1035
01:29:24,844 --> 01:29:30,288
Like it should have been months ago when, you know, when these community feedbacks are.

1036
01:29:30,428 --> 01:29:30,888
And, you know,

1037
01:29:33,560 --> 01:29:37,523
These are not six month projects from notification to approval.

1038
01:29:37,583 --> 01:29:42,346
This is, these are year long, not need to rush through type of things.

1039
01:29:45,508 --> 01:29:54,434
It also sort of brings to my mind, like we're doing all of these survey projects that should actually be part, should inform the zoning.

1040
01:29:54,890 --> 01:29:57,312
you know, any rejiggering of the zoning?

1041
01:29:57,832 --> 01:30:21,452
Yeah, most of the Salem Street Corridor, including Haines Square, is documented and that, you know, that should be something that the consultants doing the documentation looked at and said, yeah, these are historic buildings or they're not historic buildings, you know, some can change, some should be, say, the same, you know, and

1042
01:30:22,773 --> 01:30:29,157
I know they can't answer the question, is it economical to just demolish every three-decker and put up something that's six stories?

1043
01:30:29,257 --> 01:30:33,839
But I think that needs to be taken into account.

1044
01:30:36,441 --> 01:30:39,282
I mean, I think the bottom line is, yes, we want to be informed.

1045
01:30:40,263 --> 01:30:47,747
So if planning can keep us in the loop and we can comment, I think that would be a necessary step.

1046
01:30:48,424 --> 01:30:58,610
Yeah, maybe I think not to throw more on Dennis's plate, but Dennis, maybe we can start that conversation with Alicia and just see how we can just make sure that we stay in the loop there.

1047
01:31:02,232 --> 01:31:03,473
If he's there, he's probably there.

1048
01:31:03,553 --> 01:31:04,113
He can hear me.

1049
01:31:04,773 --> 01:31:06,975
No, I can hear you.

1050
01:31:07,335 --> 01:31:09,996
It's like all that stuff sort of goes through CD board and not really me.

1051
01:31:10,096 --> 01:31:17,841
So, but yeah, you can talk to Alicia and Danielle too since she staffs CD board since I think that's probably the best strategy.

1052
01:31:18,357 --> 01:31:46,428
yeah yeah okay does anybody have anything else before we go to meeting minutes how's the brooks estate doing it's before nine o'clock so i'm still hopefully not keeping anybody but i'm just curious as to what the how the brooks estate admin's doing and how you guys are doing um yeah i mean well we only have money to pay our admin

1053
01:31:47,737 --> 01:31:49,960
I can't remember if it's through the end of February or the end.

1054
01:31:49,980 --> 01:31:50,400
Five months.

1055
01:31:51,341 --> 01:31:51,562
Yeah.

1056
01:31:51,602 --> 01:31:52,923
Did she start October 1?

1057
01:31:53,784 --> 01:31:54,305
I'm not sure.

1058
01:31:55,326 --> 01:31:55,726
Yeah.

1059
01:31:55,827 --> 01:31:59,551
So we're not going to have her too much longer, unfortunately.

1060
01:32:02,314 --> 01:32:03,556
But things are moving along.

1061
01:32:07,980 --> 01:32:10,462
I'm like so brain dead right now about Brooks Estate.

1062
01:32:10,522 --> 01:32:13,645
We're, let's see, we've sent out three newsletters.

1063
01:32:14,766 --> 01:32:19,690
We have some, trying to get some volunteers to help us.

1064
01:32:21,371 --> 01:32:22,692
What else are we working on, Doug?

1065
01:32:22,712 --> 01:32:24,654
Well, the new president is fantastic.

1066
01:32:25,115 --> 01:32:26,576
Yeah, the repairs of the manor.

1067
01:32:29,955 --> 01:32:46,066
Well, the CPC was trying to get the, call it a temporary parking lot, although it may not be temporary, built this calendar year with some funds that were different from CPC, although it was partially funded by CPC.

1068
01:32:46,086 --> 01:32:58,275
We got some other money from the state and the architects, sorry, the civil engineer, Banesh, who did the design of the entire building, it rode for access drive from Grove Street to the parking lot.

1069
01:32:59,035 --> 01:33:05,139
is working on just this focused, like, mini plan, phase one, if you will, to get something that's functional.

1070
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:23,112
It's not the full, you know, multi-million dollar, rebuild the entire road, all the utilities, you know, but it's something that would give us a functional parking lot adjacent to the Carriage House this year, you know, and there's value in that to get people up there, to get increased accessibility.

1071
01:33:24,213 --> 01:33:27,315
So we're, they're starting in like a couple days to redo that.

1072
01:33:28,815 --> 01:33:34,357
piece and we're going to get it priced and put it out and hopefully build it as soon as we can.

1073
01:33:34,937 --> 01:33:36,837
Yeah, we got to spend that money by June 30th.

1074
01:33:36,897 --> 01:33:39,678
Yes, we do.

1075
01:33:39,858 --> 01:33:47,801
And we're working on revamping the membership tiers and hopefully roll that out before the end of Q1.

1076
01:33:50,361 --> 01:33:55,743
So, so, yeah, there's a lot happening up at the Brooks Estate, I mean, with the board.

1077
01:33:57,266 --> 01:34:04,251
Not much happening at the Brooks Estate, but hopefully we'll be in for a good year, especially if we can get that parking lot done.

1078
01:34:04,371 --> 01:34:05,112
That'll be huge.

1079
01:34:06,453 --> 01:34:06,693
Great.

1080
01:34:08,234 --> 01:34:21,385
While you guys are doing that stuff, Doug, it might make sense to maybe ping the cemetery department to see where they're at with the design of their seven acre parcel at the bottom of the hill.

1081
01:34:21,905 --> 01:34:23,907
So maybe tie some of that work.

1082
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,981
So they are poking around with it.

1083
01:34:27,241 --> 01:34:31,103
So they've hired a consultant to do some design work for some ideas.

1084
01:34:31,323 --> 01:34:41,068
So, um, well, we designed the access drive with a little path that leads to them and it just stops about 20 feet from the road and say, this continues here.

1085
01:34:41,588 --> 01:34:43,909
That's as far as we can take it legally.

1086
01:34:44,469 --> 01:34:45,690
We'd love to be consulted though.

1087
01:34:46,290 --> 01:34:46,490
Yeah.

1088
01:34:46,550 --> 01:34:49,352
I think there's a, there's an opportunity to collaborate there.

1089
01:34:49,372 --> 01:34:52,773
I mean, and this is the, you know, this is the other side of the road.

1090
01:34:52,793 --> 01:34:52,853
Yep.

1091
01:34:53,834 --> 01:34:54,074
Okay.

1092
01:34:54,094 --> 01:34:54,194
Yeah.

1093
01:34:54,742 --> 01:34:56,643
No, yeah, no, I'm aware of where it is.

1094
01:34:57,803 --> 01:35:09,889
Yeah, I was told that it was the Oak Grove, we finished by 2001, no more grades available and they were only off by 20 years, but now it's actually becoming true from what I can tell.

1095
01:35:09,909 --> 01:35:11,670
Yeah, I was driving around there.

1096
01:35:11,710 --> 01:35:22,995
I wonder if there's some additional space we can muster up around like the mausoleums on the other sides, but I'm sure they've maybe looked at every available location, but you just never know.

1097
01:35:23,395 --> 01:35:23,555
So.

1098
01:35:24,321 --> 01:35:24,521
Yep.

1099
01:35:24,761 --> 01:35:26,262
No, I'd love to talk to them.

1100
01:35:26,322 --> 01:35:28,044
Who do you recommend I reach out to?

1101
01:35:28,064 --> 01:35:33,448
I think Steve Brogan would probably be the best bet.

1102
01:35:34,468 --> 01:35:40,253
And to start there, I mean, he's probably dealing with a consultant and just providing an update.

1103
01:35:40,673 --> 01:35:40,953
So.

1104
01:35:40,973 --> 01:35:41,854
Okay.

1105
01:35:43,155 --> 01:35:44,135
I've talked to him before.

1106
01:35:44,195 --> 01:35:44,796
I'll reach out to him.

1107
01:35:45,256 --> 01:35:45,436
Yep.

1108
01:35:46,237 --> 01:35:47,958
So just be good to collaborate.

1109
01:35:47,978 --> 01:35:48,899
You know, the Brooks Estate is,

1110
01:35:50,618 --> 01:35:56,963
important to, you know, Medford and, you know, the historical commission has a, an active stake and a seat on that board.

1111
01:35:57,043 --> 01:35:59,925
So I think we have a role to play.

1112
01:35:59,965 --> 01:36:08,471
And of course with us, that's me with us, uh, with us collaborating with them on the heads, you know, the headstone restoration project.

1113
01:36:08,531 --> 01:36:18,818
I think that it's, uh, you know, we're all, we're all going to be able to bring stuff together and, you know, come up with something good for the cemetery and you guys and other projects moving forward.

1114
01:36:19,691 --> 01:36:20,651
Yep, 100%.

1115
01:36:24,392 --> 01:36:24,973
Okay, great.

1116
01:36:27,593 --> 01:36:28,274
Meeting minutes.

1117
01:36:29,754 --> 01:36:32,875
Peter, I found a little typo.

1118
01:36:33,515 --> 01:36:35,216
Okay.

1119
01:36:35,776 --> 01:36:44,759
Under historical commission officers and committee members, the third sentence all the way to the right, it should just be two and not two with two O's.

1120
01:36:44,779 --> 01:36:44,859
Okay.

1121
01:36:49,077 --> 01:36:51,879
Sorry, it just stuck out like a sore thumb.

1122
01:36:51,959 --> 01:36:53,721
I was like, whoa, that's a typo.

1123
01:36:55,302 --> 01:36:57,524
Otherwise, I'll take a motion to approve.

1124
01:36:58,665 --> 01:37:00,246
Move to approve with correction.

1125
01:37:00,266 --> 01:37:01,788
Thanks, Ryan.

1126
01:37:05,170 --> 01:37:05,691
Second.

1127
01:37:07,012 --> 01:37:07,552
Thank you, Ed.

1128
01:37:08,733 --> 01:37:11,776
OK, motion to approve our meeting minutes from December 2024.

1129
01:37:11,816 --> 01:37:11,996
Ryan?

1130
01:37:12,036 --> 01:37:12,096
Yes.

1131
01:37:12,136 --> 01:37:12,296
Peter?

1132
01:37:12,336 --> 01:37:12,396
Yes.

1133
01:37:17,339 --> 01:37:17,599
Kit.

1134
01:37:18,499 --> 01:37:19,820
I'll abstain because I wasn't here.

1135
01:37:20,740 --> 01:37:21,200
Thank you.

1136
01:37:22,200 --> 01:37:22,380
Ed.

1137
01:37:24,301 --> 01:37:24,561
Yep.

1138
01:37:25,361 --> 01:37:25,881
And Doug.

1139
01:37:26,462 --> 01:37:26,722
Yes.

1140
01:37:28,122 --> 01:37:31,903
OK, so four and one abstention.

1141
01:37:35,264 --> 01:37:35,784
OK, great.

1142
01:37:37,785 --> 01:37:38,805
I think that'll do it.

1143
01:37:38,965 --> 01:37:40,346
Motion to dismiss.

1144
01:37:41,646 --> 01:37:41,966
I move.

1145
01:37:44,207 --> 01:37:44,667
Second.

1146
01:37:45,574 --> 01:37:49,356
Okay, motion to close our meeting, 8.41 p.m.

1147
01:37:49,416 --> 01:37:49,876
Ryan?

1148
01:37:49,896 --> 01:37:50,396
Yes.

1149
01:37:51,057 --> 01:37:51,457
Peter?

1150
01:37:51,917 --> 01:37:52,137
Yes.

1151
01:37:52,778 --> 01:37:53,138
Kitts?

1152
01:37:53,598 --> 01:37:53,838
Yes.

1153
01:37:54,639 --> 01:37:54,799
Ed?

1154
01:37:54,819 --> 01:37:56,980
Yep.

1155
01:37:57,780 --> 01:37:58,080
Doug?

1156
01:37:59,161 --> 01:38:04,604
And yes, and when we're closed, if anyone wants to hang on and see the Tufts thing, I'm happy to answer any questions.

1157
01:38:07,245 --> 01:38:08,966
All right, thank you all.

1158
01:38:11,367 --> 01:38:11,667
Thanks.

1159
01:38:13,108 --> 01:38:13,568
Adios.

1160
01:38:14,248 --> 01:38:15,169
Stop that recording.

1161
01:38:16,208 --> 01:38:18,829
Doug, why don't I, you want me to set up a meeting?

1162
01:38:20,309 --> 01:38:22,590
Yeah, I can do that if you want.

1163
01:38:23,310 --> 01:38:28,092
It's not really a commission item, so we can, let me set up another meeting and then.

1164
01:38:28,632 --> 01:38:32,493
Okay, it'll take about five minutes for me to walk you through it if anyone's interested.

1165
01:38:32,513 --> 01:38:34,934
Okay, yeah, let me set up a meeting.

1166
01:38:34,994 --> 01:38:39,375
I'll look for your emails in about five, two minutes, two minutes.

1167
01:38:39,395 --> 01:38:40,135
Okay.

1168
01:38:40,155 --> 01:38:41,436
All right, see you in a few, thank you.
