1
00:00:00,131 --> 00:00:02,252
I think that we can call the meeting to order now.

2
00:00:02,272 --> 00:00:04,512
It is about 634.

3
00:00:04,552 --> 00:00:12,554
This is the meeting of the Community Preservation Committee at the Medford High School Media Center.

4
00:00:12,994 --> 00:00:23,617
This is the first evening of presentations for the second round of Community Preservation Act projects for this year.

5
00:00:24,878 --> 00:00:31,908
Before we get started, I wanted to remind everyone that there are materials outside the door.

6
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:38,959
We welcome public comment on the projects that are presented both this week and next week.

7
00:00:39,859 --> 00:00:46,943
And those comments can be submitted on index cards that are provided outside the door.

8
00:00:47,123 --> 00:00:52,867
We have posters that you can write on, as well, to sign your name or write some comments.

9
00:00:53,747 --> 00:01:03,473
And if people are watching this recorded from home, we welcome emails to be sent to our coordinator, Danielle Evans.

10
00:01:04,713 --> 00:01:18,100
The community preservation coordinator, you can find her information on the community preservation committee's website, either the city website or preservemedford.org.

11
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,822
I think that is it for the reminders for this evening.

12
00:01:24,783 --> 00:01:36,606
The first item in our agenda is to review and accept the minutes from July 10 and August 14 meetings.

13
00:01:37,527 --> 00:01:40,227
Is there a motion to accept the minutes?

14
00:01:41,088 --> 00:01:44,909
I just want to note that I did send Danielle an email about a typo.

15
00:01:45,489 --> 00:01:47,909
I'll make a motion to approve both minutes.

16
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:48,590
Second.

17
00:01:51,547 --> 00:01:52,087
All in favor?

18
00:01:52,107 --> 00:01:52,788
Aye.

19
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,370
The minutes are approved.

20
00:01:57,551 --> 00:02:15,864
And so next on the agenda is to invite our first applicant to come up and you can stand at the podium and we will have some images so that we can see your project as you're presenting.

21
00:02:15,904 --> 00:02:19,007
The first applicant is the Mystic River Watershed Association.

22
00:02:20,568 --> 00:02:20,868
Thank you.

23
00:02:22,754 --> 00:02:25,276
Can you clarify what the people at home are seeing?

24
00:02:25,796 --> 00:02:26,897
Are they seeing what's on the screen?

25
00:02:27,797 --> 00:02:31,139
I believe that they are seeing what's on the screen.

26
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:38,864
I think that that's at the discretion of the recording, but they should be able to see what's on the screen.

27
00:02:39,865 --> 00:02:40,806
Sorry, just one moment.

28
00:02:42,026 --> 00:02:51,733
Our format will be to give you about five to ten minutes to present, explain your project, and then committee members

29
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:58,219
We'll ask questions, and then we can entertain questions from the members of the public as well.

30
00:02:59,140 --> 00:02:59,460
Thank you.

31
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,962
So, introduce yourself, please.

32
00:03:00,982 --> 00:03:01,202
Okay.

33
00:03:02,003 --> 00:03:02,563
Hi, everyone.

34
00:03:02,603 --> 00:03:04,225
My name is Amber Christopherson.

35
00:03:04,265 --> 00:03:07,468
I'm the Greenways Director at the Mystic River Watershed Association.

36
00:03:07,488 --> 00:03:12,313
I'm not sure I'm supposed to address you guys or the audience, but I'll try to kind of do both.

37
00:03:14,395 --> 00:03:16,796
Great, so thanks for getting me first on the agenda.

38
00:03:16,816 --> 00:03:17,596
I appreciate that.

39
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:21,677
And we'll kick off the presentations for the next two days, I guess.

40
00:03:22,997 --> 00:03:25,418
So a little bit about our organization.

41
00:03:25,478 --> 00:03:29,079
The Mystic River Watershed Association has been around since 1972.

42
00:03:29,539 --> 00:03:40,602
We work to protect, enhance, and restore the Mystic River, the tributaries, and the watershed lands within the Mystic River Watershed, which is 21 cities and towns, about 600,000 people.

43
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:45,004
And so we work with thousands of volunteers a year.

44
00:03:45,245 --> 00:03:53,412
I myself am a landscape architect, and I lead our participatory design and public outreach components at MIRA related to the Greenways Initiative.

45
00:03:53,452 --> 00:04:03,000
So this map summarizes the scope of our work and our vision, which is for 25 miles of connected linear parks from the Mystic Lakes down to Boston Harbor.

46
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:10,547
And that's what I'm here to talk about today, is an effort to improve the shoreline linear park for the Mystic Lakes.

47
00:04:11,267 --> 00:04:13,429
So how many folks here have been to the Mystic Lakes?

48
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:18,094
I assume most folks, if you live in Medford, I hope you've experienced them.

49
00:04:18,154 --> 00:04:21,977
And we do a lot of work there related to the herring migration every year.

50
00:04:21,998 --> 00:04:23,699
We do a lot of activity at the dam.

51
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,703
And so maybe we'll go to the next slide.

52
00:04:27,883 --> 00:04:28,243
There we go.

53
00:04:28,623 --> 00:04:36,547
So this kind of shows the scope of our work, which on the map on the left is showing a one mile segment along Mystic Valley Parkway.

54
00:04:37,367 --> 00:04:40,529
That right now is a series of kind of desire lines.

55
00:04:40,689 --> 00:04:43,370
So it's dirt paths where you can see people have

56
00:04:44,097 --> 00:04:47,700
run, walk, maybe bike on the dirt part, I'm not sure.

57
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:54,825
I think most bikers tend to use the shoulder there to move up and down that length of road.

58
00:04:54,985 --> 00:05:08,095
And so our proposal is to create or take on a feasibility and concept design for the shared use path, looking at how to make it a more accessible path for people walking, biking, anything on wheels.

59
00:05:09,797 --> 00:05:17,023
along this one mile road, and also to look at potential overlooks and vistas so people can interact with the lakes a little bit better.

60
00:05:17,043 --> 00:05:21,367
The map I'm showing on the right is relevant in the sense, if you look up here,

61
00:05:24,752 --> 00:05:30,958
Actually three years now, DCR took on something called the Urban Path and Parkways Study, which the scope is shown there.

62
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:38,745
And it was looking at parkways that DCR owns that lack the appropriate biking and pedestrian accommodation.

63
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:43,249
So this segment is actually part of that study, which is being released later this fall.

64
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:48,834
So it's good timing in the sense that DCR has looked at very high-level recommendations for how these parkways

65
00:05:49,454 --> 00:05:55,595
can better accommodate walking and biking, and this would be a follow-up to those recommendations to move towards implementation.

66
00:05:58,112 --> 00:06:00,093
So let me see what I have in my notes here.

67
00:06:00,113 --> 00:06:03,614
A little bit about the community process.

68
00:06:03,714 --> 00:06:10,816
One thing that our organization has been doing is utilizing CPA and other communities to move our Greenways vision forward.

69
00:06:10,896 --> 00:06:19,118
So to date we've received $450,000 between Arlington and Somerville CPA to do very similar work where we're taking

70
00:06:19,818 --> 00:06:30,428
Kind of what's been studied very high level in some sort of master plan that the state or city has taken on and say, let's take this idea and recommendation to study this area more and move it forward.

71
00:06:31,048 --> 00:06:37,694
And so we're using a similar model here where we're proposing a $60,000 proposal to kind of take the first chunk.

72
00:06:38,495 --> 00:06:48,244
of this longer-term capital project and start to build a vision, do community outreach, and that's really what we lead with in all communities.

73
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:59,174
So this will be built on robust engagement with the community that includes site walks, public workshops, online surveys, kind of a range of different

74
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:09,702
community outreach that reaches, you know, in some ways we target at Butters, the people that live right there, and then also just broadly the Medford community.

75
00:07:11,123 --> 00:07:15,386
And then just for a side note, I'll show a couple images, then I'll talk about DCR.

76
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:19,031
There's just an image of people running in the road.

77
00:07:19,911 --> 00:07:23,974
I think some people like to run on dirt, but not everyone does.

78
00:07:24,655 --> 00:07:31,780
And that's one thing that this first phase of design will take on is, what will the surface be?

79
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,921
Will it be stone dust?

80
00:07:32,941 --> 00:07:36,403
You have to think about erosion, slopes, things like that.

81
00:07:38,005 --> 00:07:41,070
and what can accommodate the wheel components.

82
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:46,579
I think that's really what's lacking here is it's hard to get strollers, wheelchairs, bikes close to the lakes.

83
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,425
And then the next slide shows just, oh.

84
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:52,228
Oh, you did?

85
00:07:52,288 --> 00:07:52,848
Oh, that's okay.

86
00:07:53,048 --> 00:08:04,150
There was just one other image of sort of what could be further leverage, which was a tiny view through the trees of the sailboats, and not exactly a place where you can physically get to the water's edge.

87
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:10,071
So I think that's something that this would look at, hence why we're calling it a linear park, because it's more than just a walking and biking trail.

88
00:08:10,111 --> 00:08:13,772
It also includes that open space component.

89
00:08:15,032 --> 00:08:18,953
So as far as working with DCR, this is something that we've been building a relationship for

90
00:08:20,193 --> 00:08:28,897
I've been at Myra doing this work for two and a half years, and so typically what we do is say, hey, DCR, we have a chance to get some local funding.

91
00:08:29,197 --> 00:08:30,158
We'll take this on.

92
00:08:30,238 --> 00:08:31,058
We work with DCR.

93
00:08:31,078 --> 00:08:32,579
We include them on the steering committee.

94
00:08:32,999 --> 00:08:38,522
We help them draft the RFP to select the consultant and kind of push them that way and add

95
00:08:38,902 --> 00:08:40,623
to their capacity of what they're able to do.

96
00:08:41,644 --> 00:08:45,526
I know that there were some questions sent to me earlier about, like, are there matching funds?

97
00:08:45,586 --> 00:08:47,368
How are we going to handle construction in the future?

98
00:08:47,408 --> 00:08:51,050
Because it is a longer-term process, a project like this.

99
00:08:52,411 --> 00:08:56,634
And typically what has kicked it off in other communities is always the CPA funding.

100
00:08:56,874 --> 00:09:06,560
And it's that seed funding that really allows us to understand the technical issues, understand the community needs and ideas and potentially roadblocks, and then move it forward.

101
00:09:08,001 --> 00:09:14,885
What we've been doing with DCR is laying out, OK, for the next three to five years, where can we fit this project in the capital, your capital plan?

102
00:09:16,525 --> 00:09:23,369
And the other thing that's recently happened that's really great is Governor Baker has committed to the recreational trails program.

103
00:09:23,449 --> 00:09:26,471
And the funding for that has doubled in the last few years.

104
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:31,093
And so kind of getting in on that state funding could be huge.

105
00:09:31,213 --> 00:09:32,214
And what we found is

106
00:09:34,034 --> 00:09:53,879
For example, in Arlington, we have CPA funding to do a linear park and park redesign process that we were at schematic design in the spring and then the state MVP funding came out and we jumped on that and we got $400,000 to build a part of the park because there were flooding issues, so we tied it in with climate resiliency.

107
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:57,682
You kind of never know where the funding might come from.

108
00:09:57,742 --> 00:10:03,088
I think the city kind of has to be a key player in saying we're committed to this and trying to get the state to come along.

109
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:11,296
The fact that it is part of the state's priority in some way, in this case related to the parkway, is a good thing.

110
00:10:12,938 --> 00:10:16,442
DCR has also committed to this Mystic Greenways effort.

111
00:10:17,403 --> 00:10:20,107
I don't know if you guys have heard of the Clipper Ship Connector, I hope you have.

112
00:10:20,707 --> 00:10:29,818
We've been working with the city and the state on that project to build a gap in the network right near Medford Square so that people can stay along the river and continuously run, walk, bike.

113
00:10:30,859 --> 00:10:34,725
the Mystic, Alewife, Mystic Lakes, all the way to the Malden River.

114
00:10:34,765 --> 00:10:37,909
So that's what that regional map was showing that this is a part of.

115
00:10:37,989 --> 00:10:40,713
So I think that's it in a nutshell.

116
00:10:41,494 --> 00:10:44,278
There was a question maybe about DEP stormwater requirements.

117
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:46,300
I don't know if I should just jump into that.

118
00:10:47,481 --> 00:11:01,669
So in this case, there's no specific outfalls that we'll be addressing, but there are inherent stormwater issues, and because this is likely in, well, it's in the floodplain, it'll be subject to the Wetlands and Riverfront Act.

119
00:11:02,349 --> 00:11:07,791
And we'll be working closely with the Conservation Commission in Medford to look at what requirements we need to meet for that.

120
00:11:08,111 --> 00:11:13,713
There are existing erosion issues that we hope this path can solve, actually, as far as stormwater is concerned.

121
00:11:14,234 --> 00:11:22,157
And we will be looking at, again, surface treatments around what's better for runoff, but what can withstand the sort of use levels that we anticipate.

122
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:31,020
And what will come out of this first phase is identifying all the permitting that will be necessary in future.

123
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,261
as the project moves through the design phase.

124
00:11:37,002 --> 00:11:38,462
So, I think that's it.

125
00:11:38,502 --> 00:11:41,123
Hopefully I didn't go too far over my time.

126
00:11:41,143 --> 00:11:43,403
That's fine, thank you.

127
00:11:43,524 --> 00:11:44,444
Yeah.

128
00:11:44,564 --> 00:11:46,785
Are there questions from the committee?

129
00:11:47,605 --> 00:11:47,865
Sure.

130
00:11:48,425 --> 00:11:51,286
Since you just spoke to stormwater, I'll just jump right in there.

131
00:11:51,746 --> 00:11:54,747
Are you planning to have impervious or pervious pavement?

132
00:11:55,078 --> 00:11:55,959
Well, that's what I was just saying.

133
00:11:55,979 --> 00:11:58,140
I think we haven't decided what the surface would be.

134
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:17,054
I got a couple estimates from engineering firms who have done similar types of projects, and they basically walked the site once, and were like, I could see stone dust being a nice alternative, because what DCR is doing a lot of now is the paths that are closest to the river are a little bit more natural, so there's stone dust, they're slightly pervious.

135
00:12:17,614 --> 00:12:21,437
You just have to be wary of where rutting out might happen.

136
00:12:21,837 --> 00:12:22,357
But there is a...

137
00:12:23,898 --> 00:12:25,960
There is something between stone dust and pavement.

138
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:26,700
There is porous pavement.

139
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,662
Yeah, and then there's also porous pavement.

140
00:12:28,682 --> 00:12:35,667
So there's a spectrum, which I would also say every year there's new technologies that DCR has been employing.

141
00:12:37,188 --> 00:12:42,051
In fact, one of the engineering firms, Hatch, that gave us an estimate is working on

142
00:12:42,912 --> 00:12:49,898
the path that's on top of the MBTA seawall on the Mystic River, like the lower Mystic River connecting Boston and Somerville.

143
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:59,245
And that's using a porous pavement, also because there might be some shifting with the seawall, so they're working on the latest technologies related to that.

144
00:12:59,286 --> 00:13:00,386
So I think that's something that

145
00:13:01,227 --> 00:13:14,112
this phase would kind of look at and say you know in some ways the the desire lines that people have carved out are showing where the path should probably go but you know it's still worth looking at what's the best alignment.

146
00:13:14,552 --> 00:13:19,934
So it's not just new outfalls that need to meet stormwater standards it's any new impervious surfaces.

147
00:13:20,014 --> 00:13:20,194
Right.

148
00:13:20,874 --> 00:13:23,295
Though I think for pedestrian pathways there's

149
00:13:23,935 --> 00:13:25,216
There's some kind of exemption.

150
00:13:25,256 --> 00:13:26,016
I can't remember the width.

151
00:13:26,076 --> 00:13:27,097
It might be a six-foot width.

152
00:13:27,777 --> 00:13:28,597
Yeah.

153
00:13:29,238 --> 00:13:34,621
And I was working on this with another project with niche along the river, and there was a long list of the different permitting.

154
00:13:35,621 --> 00:13:38,383
And in that case, it was more about, is it Chapter 91 DEP?

155
00:13:38,483 --> 00:13:39,823
But here, it's not titled.

156
00:13:39,843 --> 00:13:41,544
This would clearly need to go before the commission.

157
00:13:41,584 --> 00:13:41,744
Yeah.

158
00:13:41,924 --> 00:13:44,566
And it's really laying out, what are all the permitting issues?

159
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:45,907
Is there any kind of Army Corps?

160
00:13:45,927 --> 00:13:47,167
Because it's in navigable waters.

161
00:13:47,447 --> 00:13:48,108
I don't think so here.

162
00:13:49,925 --> 00:13:51,966
just laying that out and knowing what's ahead of us.

163
00:13:51,986 --> 00:13:57,409
And that's also the reason, we've had the question, why not just apply for all the design mending you might need now?

164
00:13:58,309 --> 00:14:05,733
But we found it's helpful to take it in chunks and then understand where you are to get to the next phase.

165
00:14:06,733 --> 00:14:07,594
So, thank you.

166
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,021
Yes, Doug?

167
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:11,023
A couple of quick questions.

168
00:14:12,164 --> 00:14:20,132
You mentioned the path between Whole Foods and Winthrop Street, recently constructed, has been, I think, extremely popular and well used.

169
00:14:20,212 --> 00:14:22,054
I actually walked it this morning to Meffitt Square.

170
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:28,902
I passed through 200 Canadian geese on the way, which has been, I felt like I was going through Jurassic Park when I did it.

171
00:14:30,463 --> 00:14:37,768
I don't know if that informs the surface, but it's kind of a... That's about the vegetation around the path, the plantings.

172
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:40,189
That's a lot of lawn there.

173
00:14:40,229 --> 00:14:41,870
It's a lawn and path at the very edge of the river.

174
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:42,330
It is mostly lawn.

175
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:42,750
That's right.

176
00:14:43,011 --> 00:14:44,572
It's very popular with the geese.

177
00:14:45,392 --> 00:14:50,035
But you mentioned about a three to five year potential cycle for construction as a ballpark.

178
00:14:50,215 --> 00:14:51,976
Towards implementation, yeah.

179
00:14:51,996 --> 00:14:58,440
So again, it's informed by how we're working with DCR and CPA projects now, and it seems like it's

180
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:12,593
Taking, you know, two to three years to design and that includes getting through permitting and during that time It's continuing to look for capital funding and for the projects like this Are they typically funded with a mix of city and state funds?

181
00:15:12,613 --> 00:15:12,953
Yeah.

182
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:25,084
Okay, so your sometimes we'll find private funders if they exist in that area what would you expect Medford to put up as their percentage if you will if you had to just give an estimate based on experience and

183
00:15:26,393 --> 00:15:36,490
Frankly we're trying to get the state to pay for more Particularly because we can say look how much the city's already committed from CPA funding, right?

184
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:40,376
My guess is and I feel like you just never know what these projects with

185
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:49,603
what the soil comes up with and other challenges, but this will probably be like a million, a million and a half capital funding.

186
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:57,547
And the goal would be to try to get that in the state, the state's capital plan.

187
00:15:58,788 --> 00:16:02,831
I don't think this land was ever built on in Medford's history.

188
00:16:02,911 --> 00:16:12,079
I believe originally the original 50 acres were actually donated by the Brooks Estate family, which is why it was undeveloped for more than 100 years, I think, at the time.

189
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:15,903
So I guess I'm not expecting what you might find in a lot of urban sites.

190
00:16:15,923 --> 00:16:16,804
Yeah, I don't think so.

191
00:16:16,824 --> 00:16:20,427
Any issues with soil or mitigation or anything like that, I don't believe.

192
00:16:20,727 --> 00:16:20,987
Right.

193
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:25,733
And the state typically doesn't do soil testing for contamination.

194
00:16:25,753 --> 00:16:28,095
They just pay over parts of it.

195
00:16:28,135 --> 00:16:28,416
Okay.

196
00:16:29,157 --> 00:16:30,318
So they're very wary of that.

197
00:16:30,338 --> 00:16:31,760
Good to know.

198
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,180
Okay.

199
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,501
Thank you.

200
00:16:36,414 --> 00:16:38,175
Other questions from the committee?

201
00:16:40,957 --> 00:16:41,957
I have a question for you.

202
00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:49,682
So I think that there's a very clear case that this is actually a linear park and not a sidewalk.

203
00:16:50,603 --> 00:16:58,188
That's something that we're cognizant that CPA has gotten in trouble in the past for communities that claim that sidewalks are

204
00:16:59,329 --> 00:17:01,072
or a recreation feature.

205
00:17:01,713 --> 00:17:13,911
So I just wonder if you can elaborate a little bit more on what is the separation from the roadway and what is the distinction between this project and a sidewalk?

206
00:17:14,311 --> 00:17:23,233
Right, well I think a very obvious one would be the land ownership there and it being part of the Mystic River Reservation and actually designated as DCR publicly owned land.

207
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:25,673
And even the roadway is owned by DCR.

208
00:17:25,774 --> 00:17:33,495
So if you consider the cross section all the way from the existing sidewalk in Medford, which I, along those communities there, I would assume is owned by the city of Medford.

209
00:17:34,635 --> 00:17:40,457
And then as soon as you hit the road, which is the parkway, it's owned by DCR and all the way through to the resource area.

210
00:17:42,682 --> 00:17:43,522
is public land.

211
00:17:43,683 --> 00:17:56,009
I mean, you could also get into, I mean, I think that might be more compelling than the fact that it's recreation and walking and biking and a path with benches, because a sidewalk could have that, I guess, as well.

212
00:17:56,189 --> 00:18:01,011
But I think it's a pretty clear-cut situation.

213
00:18:01,352 --> 00:18:01,632
OK.

214
00:18:03,573 --> 00:18:03,893
Thank you.

215
00:18:05,149 --> 00:18:12,836
And the other thing I'll say, not to open up a can of worms, but I do know that crosswalks also get, you can't really include crosswalks.

216
00:18:12,876 --> 00:18:22,325
I think we can't ignore crosswalks that need to happen because of this path, particularly at High Street and some other, I was gonna say mid-block, mid-lake crossings.

217
00:18:23,246 --> 00:18:29,692
But I think we could throw out recommendations for that and not have any issues with is it eligible for CPA funding.

218
00:18:30,132 --> 00:18:36,654
Yeah, I imagine that their inclusion in the design is a different level than actually construction.

219
00:18:36,754 --> 00:18:38,294
Yeah, the same thing's happening in Somerville.

220
00:18:38,314 --> 00:18:57,740
We're redesigning Blessing of the Bay Park where the boathouse is in Somerville, and that shore drive, well, was owned by DCR, now it's kind of owned by the city of Somerville, so there's a lot of ownership discussions, but it's a similar thing where we're not looking at the crosswalks there, but we did include crosswalks in our design to think about how the community connects to the park.

221
00:18:59,558 --> 00:18:59,818
Okay.

222
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,340
Thank you.

223
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,361
Any other questions?

224
00:19:04,044 --> 00:19:04,284
Yes.

225
00:19:04,845 --> 00:19:05,305
Hold on one second.

226
00:19:05,325 --> 00:19:06,366
Your name for the record?

227
00:19:06,386 --> 00:19:06,507
Okay.

228
00:19:06,527 --> 00:19:06,687
Yeah.

229
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:27,176
Yeah, and it's really the town boundary the city boundary as I understand you can't go outside city boundary for this funding however I

230
00:19:35,644 --> 00:19:39,749
There is, albeit old, but there is paving that starts in Winchester.

231
00:19:40,409 --> 00:19:44,193
You can tell where the line is.

232
00:19:45,254 --> 00:19:55,725
What we've also found is once we start initiating this project and we're looking at ... It would be great if we could connect up to Shannon Beach and say, Shannon Beach to High Street.

233
00:19:57,386 --> 00:20:00,548
But bringing Winchester on board, like this is what we're doing right here.

234
00:20:00,848 --> 00:20:05,109
And once we improve this path, now your path is gonna be old and outdated.

235
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:09,751
So we're hoping that it'll kind of spark connections beyond that.

236
00:20:10,492 --> 00:20:12,072
But that's really the line.

237
00:20:12,092 --> 00:20:13,293
So it's right above the dam.

238
00:20:15,554 --> 00:20:16,334
To High Street.

239
00:20:16,894 --> 00:20:17,114
To 60, yeah.

240
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:25,671
And again, there's some improvements that need to happen on that other part of the river coming up to that.

241
00:20:26,212 --> 00:20:28,152
But then it's also in Arlington on the other side.

242
00:20:28,212 --> 00:20:34,234
So dealing with the municipal boundaries can be difficult.

243
00:20:36,095 --> 00:20:36,195
OK.

244
00:20:36,555 --> 00:20:36,695
Yeah.

245
00:20:36,915 --> 00:20:37,295
Thank you.

246
00:20:38,215 --> 00:20:38,636
All right.

247
00:20:38,856 --> 00:20:40,156
Thanks.

248
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:45,378
I also did bring a card and some maps if anybody wants one.

249
00:20:45,738 --> 00:20:45,958
Anyone?

250
00:20:49,113 --> 00:20:50,794
Here, you can take one and pass if you want.

251
00:20:51,435 --> 00:20:54,318
But that's like the same map that was shown on the first screen.

252
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:55,219
Thank you.

253
00:20:55,339 --> 00:20:58,303
And I do have to head to another meeting in Arlington for CPAP.

254
00:20:59,043 --> 00:21:01,306
So I'm sorry to leave early.

255
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:01,886
Thank you.

256
00:21:01,906 --> 00:21:02,167
Good luck.

257
00:21:02,187 --> 00:21:03,048
Thank you very much.

258
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:18,834
All right, so we'll invite the Medford Historical Commission to take the podium next.

259
00:21:44,848 --> 00:21:45,848
Hi, everybody.

260
00:21:45,868 --> 00:21:47,069
I'm Jennifer Keenan.

261
00:21:47,649 --> 00:21:50,109
I'm the co-chair of the Medford Historical Commission.

262
00:21:50,549 --> 00:21:56,491
And, you know, our job at the commission is to, you know, help preserve and protect our history here in Medford.

263
00:21:57,471 --> 00:22:04,732
And, you know, when we were thinking about an application for CPA, we tossed around a few ideas.

264
00:22:04,792 --> 00:22:11,574
And one of the projects that had been on our wish list for some time was the slave wall, which is on Grove Street.

265
00:22:12,554 --> 00:22:20,476
And, you know, the project kind of evolved from just looking at the wall to looking at the entire park in and of itself.

266
00:22:21,176 --> 00:22:28,378
So, I think we can start with the wall kind of as the problem child, for some lack of a better way to describe it.

267
00:22:28,918 --> 00:22:30,638
You know, it's a beautiful site here.

268
00:22:31,499 --> 00:22:34,019
The wall was part of Thomas Brooks' house.

269
00:22:34,539 --> 00:22:35,760
It was built by his slave.

270
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:43,203
The clay for the bricks was used from the shore of the lake there.

271
00:22:44,343 --> 00:22:54,788
The worst thing about the wall is that you have to stand in the middle of Grove Street to admire the wall and actually read the marker.

272
00:22:55,628 --> 00:23:00,532
And anybody who knows Grove Street, I live on Grove Street, so I walk by this every day.

273
00:23:00,552 --> 00:23:12,500
And you're trying to stand there to read it, and there's an incline up there, so if you're trying to get close to the marker, if you have bad eyesight like me, you're kind of on this hilly terrain.

274
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:37,831
there's no sidewalk there and there are cars whizzing by you behind you coming up Grove Street and so you know I just think as a resident of Grove Street as somebody who lives in the neighborhood that the wall just gets lost amongst you know it just looks like a big brushy piece of woods there and you know if you're on the sidewalk across the street you may or may not pay a lot of attention to it you might think it's part of the

275
00:23:38,331 --> 00:23:42,374
commuter rail fence and whatnot.

276
00:23:42,494 --> 00:23:58,386
So when I started to dig into the application and the project and I did some more research on the wall itself and really discovered that there's a six acre park here that was all of the land that Thomas Brooks owned himself.

277
00:23:59,007 --> 00:24:06,633
And the park is part of, it's one of the 15 sites of the Brooks estate and all of their influences here in Medford.

278
00:24:07,313 --> 00:24:15,875
And so as the project evolved, it just made more sense to look at the park in its entirety and not just the wall itself and the marker.

279
00:24:15,995 --> 00:24:19,596
I'll be, I think we can agree that these are probably the most important parts of it.

280
00:24:20,816 --> 00:24:24,737
But there is a larger, I don't know if you have a picture of the site.

281
00:24:27,597 --> 00:24:28,437
Okay, yeah.

282
00:24:28,897 --> 00:24:29,918
There is actually,

283
00:24:32,147 --> 00:24:33,949
I don't know if you can see it in your packet.

284
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:36,413
Towards the end, I included some photos.

285
00:24:37,634 --> 00:24:47,867
You can see there's a, you know, kind of a really nice wedge of green space here that, again, just gets lost amongst Grove Street as

286
00:24:49,232 --> 00:24:49,613
Nothing.

287
00:24:50,274 --> 00:25:04,774
And there's some makeshift foot trails in there, and there's this beautiful kind of open field that, you know, when you take a step back and kind of look at the whole site, it just made more sense to come up with a master plan to actually develop the entire site.

288
00:25:05,555 --> 00:25:07,796
And what could this park be?

289
00:25:07,876 --> 00:25:10,617
It could have some beautiful seating arrangements.

290
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:12,298
It could have a water element.

291
00:25:12,718 --> 00:25:18,700
Certainly an interpretive panel on Mr. Brooks and his family and his contributions to the city of Medford.

292
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:29,424
And one of the main goals of the park itself would be to turn the marker around so that you're accessing it from the inside and not on the road.

293
00:25:30,184 --> 00:25:34,366
Be able to get up close to the wall, really investigate it, move some of the brush away,

294
00:25:35,026 --> 00:25:36,867
and just get in there and enjoy it.

295
00:25:38,067 --> 00:25:45,751
And so again, when we're looking at the whole park in and of itself, it just made more sense to come up with perhaps a parking area.

296
00:25:46,311 --> 00:26:00,678
And so really the application evolved from there and now we're looking at it as an entire master plan for the park and having a design concept created for the park and how could this space be used.

297
00:26:03,537 --> 00:26:04,377
Thank you.

298
00:26:04,457 --> 00:26:05,518
Sorry, I feel like I rambled.

299
00:26:06,018 --> 00:26:06,498
Not at all.

300
00:26:06,739 --> 00:26:07,439
That's perfect.

301
00:26:08,479 --> 00:26:09,480
Questions from the committee?

302
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,181
This is a really stupid question.

303
00:26:11,821 --> 00:26:14,082
Which one is the wall, the brick or the stones?

304
00:26:14,202 --> 00:26:15,543
Yes, this side.

305
00:26:15,603 --> 00:26:17,784
So this is the actual slave wall itself.

306
00:26:18,404 --> 00:26:25,968
And then the marker on the left is a piece of granite with a bronze placard on it, which is the marker explaining what the wall is.

307
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:49,009
It's funny they just put a speed bump on Grove Street kind of down a little bit so it you know now the cars don't come whizzing by quite as fast but literally the day I was there taking photos you know I'm like kind of standing on the wall

308
00:26:49,469 --> 00:27:02,993
trying to take photos and there's cars coming behind me and you know it's just kind of one of those moments where you think to yourself who put this here and why did nobody think to turn it around so that you're not standing in the middle of the road to be able to read it.

309
00:27:04,594 --> 00:27:04,874
Yes.

310
00:27:05,234 --> 00:27:08,355
Could you talk a little bit about how the property will be

311
00:27:09,395 --> 00:27:15,581
Could you talk a little bit about how the property could be accessed or would be accessed?

312
00:27:15,601 --> 00:27:29,693
Yeah Sure, so there's actually kind of a makeshift area now that Because the they do go in and there's a kind of a big grassy area and the city I assume it's the city goes in and they mow the grass every once in a while.

313
00:27:30,014 --> 00:27:33,497
So there's a makeshift kind of like road that goes in there and

314
00:27:33,897 --> 00:27:47,210
And so one of the things that I talked to the landscape architect about, I had a representative from Shadley and Associates out of Lexington, they had done some projects around Medford and other communities, kind of some of these larger park concepts.

315
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:52,375
So I had Pam Shadley come out with me, we walked the site, and we do envision some sort of

316
00:27:52,895 --> 00:28:07,378
maybe a little mini driveway and a couple of parking spots there so that if somebody wants to come from a different part of town to enjoy the park, especially any residents or any visitors to the main Shepherds Brooks Manor.

317
00:28:07,438 --> 00:28:19,421
And I think it's important to try to tie the two sites together because our goal, I'm also on the Brooks Estate Committee, I am the liaison from the Historical Commission to the Brooks Estate Committee,

318
00:28:20,261 --> 00:28:27,743
And, you know, our goal is to get more visitors up to the manor and to make that a functioning space and, you know, generating revenue for the city.

319
00:28:28,183 --> 00:28:45,807
And this is such a short walk away, you know, it would be great to be able to let people realize that, you know, they're tied together and that they could, you know, not only go to the main manor, but go down the street just a little bit to, you know, another family members and read about them and learn about them as well.

320
00:28:46,367 --> 00:28:54,917
So, whether it's somebody coming from out of town who parks and, you know, visits the manor and they want to drive down and park at the Thomas Brooks Park.

321
00:28:54,977 --> 00:29:00,703
So, we do envision, you know, perhaps a couple of parking spots there at some point and a little area to pull in.

322
00:29:04,202 --> 00:29:08,905
Yeah, I think the access would be, you know, it makes more sense to come in that way.

323
00:29:08,925 --> 00:29:13,929
You know, I don't know if it's ultimately going to be, you know, probably towards the lower end of the park.

324
00:29:14,789 --> 00:29:21,653
I think probably right by where the little speed bump is now or at the other end where there's almost a little makeshift driveway right now.

325
00:29:22,214 --> 00:29:23,595
There isn't a curb cut there.

326
00:29:23,755 --> 00:29:27,337
So, you know, I think we'd have to work with the city to figure that that out.

327
00:29:27,497 --> 00:29:47,454
Yeah, there'd be some sightline issues there because that's again that road it's very tough there it curves It's not straight and I think when you're coming over the bridge I don't know that necessarily having the the entryway right there would be feasible because Someone's gonna fly over the bridge and not realize someone stopped I suspect it's further south as you said, but that's again That's part of the study right is to figure out where could it go?

328
00:29:47,514 --> 00:29:48,195
Where should it go?

329
00:29:48,215 --> 00:29:53,139
It probably wants to align without the streets that you create an intersection obviously not offset right and we also

330
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:58,789
The landscape architect and myself, we were talking about access from the neighborhoods across.

331
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:01,274
There's beautiful residential neighborhood across.

332
00:30:01,938 --> 00:30:09,743
And, you know, a couple of crosswalks there, perhaps some lighting there at some point too could be amenable to get foot traffic there.

333
00:30:09,863 --> 00:30:14,405
Because I think right now, again, like I mentioned, the space just gets lost.

334
00:30:14,445 --> 00:30:19,208
And I don't even know that the residents who live almost across the street even realize what's there.

335
00:30:19,628 --> 00:30:30,335
And so I think if there's an obvious way to access it and, you know, some nice ways to pull in and say, oh, this is actually something we should pay attention to, would make a lot of sense.

336
00:30:32,487 --> 00:30:37,654
Apologies for not knowing the answer to this, but is there an invasive species management portion of the project?

337
00:30:38,475 --> 00:30:39,316
Not at this time.

338
00:30:39,376 --> 00:30:44,122
I don't think that we at this point realize kind of what's in there.

339
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:46,505
I know we've just done some invasive

340
00:30:47,606 --> 00:30:55,913
species management up at the manor itself, that we did some CPA for the Brooks Estates last round.

341
00:30:56,733 --> 00:31:01,917
But we haven't quite figured out what's in here yet, so I think that's something that we could definitely look into.

342
00:31:01,937 --> 00:31:04,880
I used to ride my bike through there, but there's so much poison ivy.

343
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:09,942
Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if there's some naughty stuff in there.

344
00:31:09,962 --> 00:31:13,083
A lot of Norway maple and a lot of frozen ivy.

345
00:31:13,283 --> 00:31:13,543
Yes.

346
00:31:13,883 --> 00:31:28,329
And I guess at one point, and I'll be looking to my fellow commissioners and the folks at the Brooks Estate to research this a little bit more, there was a bank of elm trees that was quite beautiful and very visible from that park.

347
00:31:28,809 --> 00:31:50,146
which clearly have all been grown in, and so I think if there's a way to make those elms visible again, and you know, it could be quite beautiful if we could bring those back to life and make them purposeful there, that they were purposely planted and meant as kind of an access way and a, you know, eye point of contact for visitors.

348
00:31:52,935 --> 00:31:57,298
Is part of the thought to restore the slave or just preserve what's there?

349
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:58,879
I think just preserve what's there.

350
00:31:58,899 --> 00:32:05,583
I think we would also make sure that if there is any deterioration, perhaps we need to look at that in the future.

351
00:32:06,563 --> 00:32:11,566
Right now, you can't even get to it, so I think it would be hard to answer that fully.

352
00:32:11,626 --> 00:32:16,629
But once we clear the brush all away, if there is any repointing that needs to happen or

353
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:26,375
The wall, if you look at it from kind of, you know, the end and you're looking, it definitely kind of canters a little bit, but that could be purposeful.

354
00:32:26,415 --> 00:32:28,997
I'm not 100% sure that it wasn't always that way.

355
00:32:29,017 --> 00:32:34,540
I'm sure it wasn't, you know, they didn't have a level when it was built.

356
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,561
I do worry about it tumbling into Grove Street.

357
00:32:37,581 --> 00:32:42,783
That's what I fear when I drive by that thing every time because it's clearly No one's really taking care of it, right?

358
00:32:42,903 --> 00:32:49,765
I mean, I haven't seen anybody working that on that that wall in at least 20 years that I can remember

359
00:32:50,753 --> 00:33:00,218
And I think it can't be emphasized enough, because I know you mentioned at the beginning, but this and the Royal House are the two most prominent pieces talking about slavery in Medford.

360
00:33:00,238 --> 00:33:07,502
And this is absolutely critical that people know what this is, understand it, along with the Royal House.

361
00:33:07,522 --> 00:33:12,064
The Royal House has reinvented itself, obviously, in the last 20 years to refocus their whole mission.

362
00:33:12,085 --> 00:33:18,008
And I think a similar thing can start to happen here to make this site and the story behind it

363
00:33:18,668 --> 00:33:20,369
which we really don't know a lot about.

364
00:33:20,389 --> 00:33:21,590
I know some of it.

365
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,070
You've done some research as well.

366
00:33:23,871 --> 00:33:24,891
But there's definitely more out there.

367
00:33:26,052 --> 00:33:29,694
The history of slavery in Medford is just not well documented.

368
00:33:29,994 --> 00:33:36,938
And this is an opportunity to re-engage that whole issue on a beautiful piece of property that is wildly underutilized right now.

369
00:33:37,318 --> 00:33:37,558
Right.

370
00:33:37,698 --> 00:33:45,825
And you know, and it is, I would think my personal opinion is that it's, it's in really good shape, considering it hasn't been taken care of.

371
00:33:45,905 --> 00:33:49,188
But I, you know, we want to maintain it, we don't want it to crumble into the street.

372
00:33:49,989 --> 00:33:59,256
And I and again, I think just the opportunity to make the space all around a beautiful and a welcoming place would be, you know, a great use of CPA funds.

373
00:34:01,338 --> 00:34:03,440
And I'm sorry, if I should know this, but the

374
00:34:04,845 --> 00:34:05,985
The city owns the property?

375
00:34:06,466 --> 00:34:06,706
Yes.

376
00:34:07,426 --> 00:34:11,547
And will be, the idea is that it would be maintained by the city?

377
00:34:11,607 --> 00:34:24,851
Yeah, I think once it's a fully functioning park, I would imagine that it would fall under DPW purview and whatever their rounds of maintenance are and grass cutting and whatnot, it would fall under them.

378
00:34:25,211 --> 00:34:27,572
Are there any other archeological resources on the site?

379
00:34:28,386 --> 00:34:29,386
You know, that's a good question.

380
00:34:29,447 --> 00:34:49,396
I think that that, when we, if we're able to clear it away and, you know, certainly if there's any digging that's gonna be happening, if we decide to do some other elements of the park and, you know, grading has to happen and digging that, you know, certainly if there's anything there that we can find and preserve, we would include that in the proposal.

381
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:54,092
You had a question?

382
00:34:54,473 --> 00:34:57,141
My question was about maintenance and who owns the property.

383
00:34:57,242 --> 00:34:57,462
Yeah.

384
00:34:57,623 --> 00:34:57,843
Okay.

385
00:34:58,044 --> 00:34:59,448
Yeah, the city owns it for sure.

386
00:35:02,224 --> 00:35:08,106
What do you see as the next step after this master plan is completed, then what happens?

387
00:35:09,947 --> 00:35:23,471
So my envision is, my thought is that, you know, well, it'll be, this is almost a phased approach, so the first part is the actual, you know, some sort of master plan, and then, you know,

388
00:35:24,491 --> 00:35:37,435
I think working with the Historical Commission and MBELT, does the rendering of whatever the landscape architect provided, does that work with our vision and what we want to do and how we see it?

389
00:35:38,095 --> 00:35:40,036
Does any tweaking need to take place?

390
00:35:40,076 --> 00:35:44,097
Do we need to go broader, wider, bring in other vendors?

391
00:35:45,117 --> 00:35:49,880
And then I think it would be a phased approach to actually implementation.

392
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,841
And what does that look like?

393
00:35:52,001 --> 00:35:55,203
Is it focusing on the wall and the marker first?

394
00:35:55,383 --> 00:35:57,044
Is it a larger green space?

395
00:35:57,164 --> 00:35:59,845
Is it an access point for parking?

396
00:35:59,865 --> 00:36:06,209
I think depending on what it turns out to be or what some of the ideas are,

397
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:18,398
Then we can start to look at at phases and certainly we would want to bring the community into it as well You know the the butters and the neighbors what do the folks in that could access it by foot?

398
00:36:18,458 --> 00:36:19,399
What would they want to see?

399
00:36:19,439 --> 00:36:20,800
How would they like to use the space?

400
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:23,862
Are they looking for green space to go sit and read a book?

401
00:36:24,122 --> 00:36:26,504
Are they looking for a place for their kids to play?

402
00:36:27,305 --> 00:36:32,449
I think it could be a myriad of things, you know, we have a really beautiful jungle gym over at play said Park, which is not a

403
00:36:32,869 --> 00:36:34,892
that far behind, you know, down Bustle.

404
00:36:34,932 --> 00:36:38,177
It's a little bit of an easy walk from all of us over there.

405
00:36:38,257 --> 00:36:41,742
So maybe the park, maybe the Brooks Park is something different, you know.

406
00:36:41,862 --> 00:36:46,788
Maybe it's just a nice quiet place to sit, have a picnic, read a little bit, learn some history.

407
00:36:46,808 --> 00:36:49,893
So I think we need to figure some of those things out.

408
00:36:50,935 --> 00:36:55,659
Actually, that was gonna be my next question was what do you envision for public input in the process?

409
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:06,608
Yeah, we would definitely want the neighbors involved for sure And then I and anybody really, you know, this is a green space in Medford It could be my hope is that it's accessed by the whole town.

410
00:37:06,728 --> 00:37:10,672
You know, there's part there's parking there And people would come and enjoy it.

411
00:37:10,732 --> 00:37:12,693
So what do you know?

412
00:37:12,873 --> 00:37:16,877
We have a lot of beautiful parks in Medford and I think thinking of

413
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:23,615
what needs are being addressed in certain parks and what are the holes and can we fill in some of those holes here.

414
00:37:24,997 --> 00:37:43,990
I think it's probably comparable to the road design at the Brooks Estate in terms of its process that we looked at in phase one, I'm sorry, round one of the CPA because there's clearly dozens of stakeholders who would need to be involved, engineering, even historical society, the abutters, OCD, engineering.

415
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:49,634
I mean, there's so many people who need to be part of this discussion about what that park becomes.

416
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:52,656
It's quite a shopping list of people from what I gather.

417
00:37:53,397 --> 00:37:56,178
Because we're just starting to think that through right now on the road.

418
00:37:56,238 --> 00:37:56,959
On the road, right.

419
00:37:57,039 --> 00:37:58,399
And it's comparable.

420
00:37:58,539 --> 00:37:59,860
It's almost the same size.

421
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,560
The driveway.

422
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,341
That's right.

423
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:04,262
Thank you for correcting.

424
00:38:04,642 --> 00:38:05,302
The driveway.

425
00:38:05,322 --> 00:38:16,067
Yeah, and I think, you know, there could be some elements there that once, for example, once the driveway is designed and we know what's going to be happening up at the manor,

426
00:38:16,687 --> 00:38:20,970
then perhaps some ideas for the park fall out of that.

427
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:27,535
If X, Y, and Z is happening over here, a mile down the road can be X, Y, and Z over here.

428
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:41,806
So I think that the timing of this while we're kind of thinking of both sites and actively pursuing money and projects for both sites, the timing is good where we can all work together to make them work together.

429
00:38:41,826 --> 00:38:42,947
Thank you.

430
00:38:46,463 --> 00:38:49,206
How involved is the Community Development Office with this?

431
00:38:49,406 --> 00:38:56,755
I mean, besides the obvious preservation of the wall, it seems a little bit beyond the scope of the Historical Commission on its own.

432
00:38:57,774 --> 00:39:01,697
Yeah, I mean, to my knowledge, they haven't been involved in this at all.

433
00:39:01,877 --> 00:39:06,281
And, you know, when creating the proposal, I did not reach out to them.

434
00:39:07,202 --> 00:39:13,187
You know, our thought at the Historical Commission is that, you know, this is something that we wanted to implement and start.

435
00:39:13,767 --> 00:39:18,291
And I think, you know, us and EMBELT working together, I think, is a really good place to start.

436
00:39:18,371 --> 00:39:22,775
And then, you know, as Doug mentioned, we'll pull in other folks as needed.

437
00:39:23,495 --> 00:39:25,755
You know, we have seven members on the Historical Commission.

438
00:39:25,775 --> 00:39:33,077
I think we're a really great body, and we all come from all walks of life and professional backgrounds.

439
00:39:33,117 --> 00:39:47,079
And I think, you know, when we were discussing this and kind of reviewing our final application, we all thought that this is something that, as a group, we could manage together and at least, you know, get the ball rolling as far down the road as possible.

440
00:39:48,799 --> 00:39:51,060
And, you know, we can just do it on our end.

441
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:52,560
Thank you.

442
00:39:56,212 --> 00:39:56,552
All right.

443
00:39:56,873 --> 00:39:57,253
Thank you.

444
00:39:57,273 --> 00:39:57,974
Thank you guys.

445
00:39:58,054 --> 00:39:58,594
Thank you.

446
00:40:00,776 --> 00:40:06,101
The next project is Oak Grove Cemetery historic landscape rehabilitation.

447
00:40:08,543 --> 00:40:08,843
Hi there.

448
00:40:09,564 --> 00:40:10,985
Introduce yourself please.

449
00:40:11,105 --> 00:40:12,066
I'm Abigail Salerno.

450
00:40:12,086 --> 00:40:13,667
I'm also from the Historical Commission.

451
00:40:15,208 --> 00:40:22,655
And this application comes from the Historical Commission working with the cemetery trustees and the Medford tree warden.

452
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:27,102
Were you able to include pictures from this afternoon?

453
00:40:27,182 --> 00:40:27,302
No.

454
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:29,286
Okay, I have some recent pictures.

455
00:40:31,272 --> 00:40:33,113
Three sets of trees.

456
00:40:35,994 --> 00:40:38,635
A stump, a tree that's already been removed.

457
00:40:39,595 --> 00:40:46,558
Some trees that are clearly sort of truncated and dead in front of a mausoleum.

458
00:40:46,958 --> 00:40:50,619
They are obviously marked to be removed and partially removed.

459
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:51,980
Their limbs are missing.

460
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,021
And then the third photo is

461
00:40:56,242 --> 00:41:01,606
trees marked to be removed that still have their limbs but are clearly unhealthy and dying.

462
00:41:05,649 --> 00:41:11,613
The trees in the photos and the trees in the application are all located over here in the

463
00:41:13,466 --> 00:41:16,848
in the rock garden portion of the cemetery.

464
00:41:16,908 --> 00:41:21,091
That's the original land that was set aside.

465
00:41:21,131 --> 00:41:37,041
It was designed by a landscape architect in the Victorian period to be a public park, to be a place where people walked, where people enjoyed outdoor space in a very sort of manicured, a relatively manicured

466
00:41:37,721 --> 00:41:38,502
type landscape.

467
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:51,129
It's not the fells, it's not a ball field, it's not a playground, it's a quiet and somewhat formal space.

468
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:58,554
And right now there are 20 trees in there that are sort of in various states as shown in the photographs.

469
00:41:59,254 --> 00:42:07,337
either they've recently been removed, they're slated for removal, or they're obviously unhealthy.

470
00:42:07,737 --> 00:42:23,122
So the application is applying for money to replace those trees and also to install in the cemetery an informational kiosk that can focus and capitalize on what the Historical Commission thinks is sort of significant community interest in using this space.

471
00:42:24,202 --> 00:42:35,349
Obviously, local historians, genealogists visit the cemetery, people visiting, graves of family members visit the cemetery, but the cemetery also hosts joggers, people with strollers.

472
00:42:36,009 --> 00:42:40,872
It is plowed all winter, so people enjoy using it in the winter.

473
00:42:41,712 --> 00:42:44,434
people learn to drive in the Elk Grove Cemetery.

474
00:42:44,494 --> 00:42:48,476
Or at least they remember fondly having learned to drive or having learned to ride their bicycles.

475
00:42:48,496 --> 00:42:52,978
So there's a really strong sentimental attachment to the cemetery as a whole.

476
00:42:54,859 --> 00:42:55,939
People learn to ride their bikes.

477
00:42:56,039 --> 00:43:00,782
Seniors take prom pictures there because it's one of Medford's only formal gardens.

478
00:43:01,842 --> 00:43:02,422
in some ways.

479
00:43:02,542 --> 00:43:14,906
It has flowering plants and then it has trees that are intentionally placed in a designed landscape that creates beautiful views and vistas as you walk the paths in the rock garden section.

480
00:43:16,027 --> 00:43:23,509
Boulders, sort of these picturesque points of interest that were designed by the original planners.

481
00:43:24,389 --> 00:43:26,450
It's a space a lot like

482
00:43:28,696 --> 00:43:29,938
Mount Auburn or Forest Hills.

483
00:43:30,038 --> 00:43:31,780
It has that feel.

484
00:43:32,201 --> 00:43:37,869
And it could have some of the same uses and some of the same popularity that those places have.

485
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:40,953
So the informational kiosk is pulled together.

486
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:42,375
It would have a guest book.

487
00:43:42,435 --> 00:43:44,317
Hopefully it would set out some of the

488
00:43:45,058 --> 00:43:52,985
guidelines for using the space, make people feel welcome, let them know that by being there and using the space, they were following the rules.

489
00:43:53,106 --> 00:43:56,589
People often feel like they're trespassing if they go in the cemetery.

490
00:43:56,609 --> 00:44:00,973
We want to dispel that while at the same time telling them, yeah, don't leave a mess.

491
00:44:02,774 --> 00:44:03,375
Stuff like that.

492
00:44:03,475 --> 00:44:04,696
So two parts.

493
00:44:06,873 --> 00:44:12,279
replacing about 20 trees, and then erecting an informational kiosk.

494
00:44:16,544 --> 00:44:16,705
Yeah.

495
00:44:19,288 --> 00:44:19,688
Thank you.

496
00:44:19,928 --> 00:44:21,230
Any questions from the committee?

497
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:26,196
So is it all in that area on the Winchester line down here?

498
00:44:27,457 --> 00:44:33,239
There are 20 trees in that area that are in the process of being removed.

499
00:44:34,019 --> 00:44:43,783
There are same type of trees throughout the rest of the cemetery that are in trouble, but there are much far fewer trees in the rest of the cemetery.

500
00:44:43,863 --> 00:44:49,905
It's sunnier, it's more open, so there might be like five or six in the cemetery as a whole.

501
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:52,210
on the larger part of the cemetery.

502
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:56,432
It's sort of disproportionately over here that the trees exist.

503
00:44:56,592 --> 00:44:56,692
Right.

504
00:44:56,712 --> 00:44:57,872
Does that fountain work?

505
00:44:58,332 --> 00:44:58,532
What?

506
00:44:58,652 --> 00:44:59,572
Does the fountain work?

507
00:45:00,353 --> 00:45:01,493
Does the fountain work?

508
00:45:01,553 --> 00:45:04,814
I see a fountain, or maybe it's just Fountain Road around us.

509
00:45:05,114 --> 00:45:05,994
There is a fountain.

510
00:45:06,014 --> 00:45:09,855
There's beautiful sculptures in the cemetery.

511
00:45:10,195 --> 00:45:10,975
There's a fountain.

512
00:45:11,235 --> 00:45:15,236
There's a beautiful set of stone steps that lead down to Winthrop Street.

513
00:45:15,256 --> 00:45:16,357
These are huge projects.

514
00:45:17,437 --> 00:45:29,993
Cemetery, if it developed friends of the cemetery group, or if it continued to engage the public, should and could work on, that is not where we are starting.

515
00:45:31,014 --> 00:45:34,138
We are starting with replacing some stumps.

516
00:45:36,814 --> 00:45:38,655
It's such a beautiful place.

517
00:45:38,855 --> 00:45:40,376
I've never been to that area.

518
00:45:42,938 --> 00:45:46,260
And it does, at this point, take knowing about it and intentionally going to it.

519
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:58,287
You can drive into the cemetery and immediately head to the more contemporary area on the left without noticing that we have this historic landscape over in the corner.

520
00:45:59,247 --> 00:46:06,630
And I think, as Jen was saying, it really is a kind of space that we don't have a lot of in Medford.

521
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:20,915
We have beautiful parks and playgrounds, and we have the fells, but this is historic and it's formal in a way that isn't something you'd find in other parts of Medford's sort of greenscape map.

522
00:46:23,827 --> 00:46:29,850
And who does the maintenance now and who will do this project?

523
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:36,192
DPW is happy to replant the trees that we can fund.

524
00:46:36,772 --> 00:46:41,074
They currently do the raking and the maintenance of what's there.

525
00:46:43,875 --> 00:46:48,676
They were the ones that gave us the price for replacing the trees.

526
00:46:49,976 --> 00:47:01,838
I do think that they could be helped and supported by, again, an ongoing friends group, especially if we wanted them to do more in terms of maintaining the historic quality.

527
00:47:01,979 --> 00:47:03,399
And there's no friends group right now?

528
00:47:03,499 --> 00:47:03,659
Nope.

529
00:47:06,039 --> 00:47:07,200
And in fact, I think they

530
00:47:10,933 --> 00:47:13,015
They have a trustees group of three.

531
00:47:13,215 --> 00:47:14,756
They would like to have more trustees.

532
00:47:15,197 --> 00:47:17,479
They lost a trustee.

533
00:47:17,499 --> 00:47:18,280
They gained a trustee.

534
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:19,521
There's still a trustee short.

535
00:47:20,001 --> 00:47:27,148
I think that there's a lot of work to be done in getting people to understand that the cemetery is something that if we value, we can contribute.

536
00:47:31,452 --> 00:47:32,733
Other questions?

537
00:47:35,361 --> 00:47:36,441
I had a couple of questions.

538
00:47:36,542 --> 00:47:38,483
One of them was the kiosks.

539
00:47:39,224 --> 00:47:54,435
The kiosks, I understand, are kind of a capital investment in building the structures themselves, but they will be populated with materials that are more transient in nature.

540
00:47:54,855 --> 00:48:08,165
Can the cost of the materials be another source of funding be used for those transient materials so that the CPA funds are focused on the capital improvements?

541
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:10,507
Do you understand what I'm asking?

542
00:48:10,527 --> 00:48:11,368
Yeah, I do understand what you're asking.

543
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:17,152
It's going to be a kind of maintenance of the kiosk, just in terms of keeping it up to date and stocked.

544
00:48:17,172 --> 00:48:21,375
Who can take charge of ensuring that the materials are kept up to date?

545
00:48:23,197 --> 00:48:40,074
Well, the Historical Commission is making this application and is willing to consider either investing that kind of work and funds to it or, again, finding a group of friends to raise that money and keep it viable.

546
00:48:46,354 --> 00:49:03,504
And I was also, in reading the application, I'm trying to make sure that I understand the relationship between the Historical Commission, the tree warden, the DPW, of who's managing the project and who's, you know, actually carrying it out.

547
00:49:04,685 --> 00:49:06,626
The Historical Commission would be managing the project.

548
00:49:06,666 --> 00:49:07,266
It would be me.

549
00:49:08,667 --> 00:49:15,030
So far, Dee Morris, the cemetery trustee, has been the person who's given me sort of the most guidance in terms of

550
00:49:17,702 --> 00:49:27,407
what she thinks is needed in the cemetery and who she thinks we can work with to get the work done.

551
00:49:29,908 --> 00:49:41,794
So it would probably be me and her and Aggie Toon, the tree warden, researching what kind of trees should replace these trees because there's, I think, a case to be made for the same trees.

552
00:49:41,834 --> 00:49:43,175
That's what was historically there.

553
00:49:43,615 --> 00:49:44,876
Or maybe something that isn't.

554
00:49:46,397 --> 00:50:02,736
quite as susceptible to disease because the trees are really unhealthy so making those decisions it would be the three of us and working with the cemetery superintendent who is a DPW employee once we've made those decisions to have them carry out the replanting which

555
00:50:04,631 --> 00:50:05,812
Okay, what are the trees now?

556
00:50:05,913 --> 00:50:07,354
What type of trees are they right now?

557
00:50:07,454 --> 00:50:08,055
The ones that didn't?

558
00:50:08,075 --> 00:50:11,519
I don't know.

559
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:16,805
The tree warden needs to take a trip out and help me make a definitive decision.

560
00:50:16,885 --> 00:50:20,129
It's an oak tree, but I don't know like, sure, what kind.

561
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:24,875
And I don't know whether it's something we would want to use as a replacement or not.

562
00:50:25,315 --> 00:50:28,537
Right, I guess part of that is why did they fail?

563
00:50:28,697 --> 00:50:30,398
I guess, you know, it's the obvious counter question.

564
00:50:30,558 --> 00:50:36,602
No, I think that working on that is something that me and the trustee and the tree warden will be.

565
00:50:38,007 --> 00:50:46,529
I think your comparison to Mount Auburn is interesting because obviously they're of the same vintage when that oldest part of the cemetery was designed and built.

566
00:50:48,230 --> 00:50:58,232
Obviously Mount Auburn has a lot more marquee famous people buried there, but if you go there on a fall weekend there are hundreds if not more people.

567
00:50:58,352 --> 00:50:59,852
It's like a destination.

568
00:51:02,333 --> 00:51:11,363
It's because there's maps and there's information and I know Dee has done tours of the cemetery and they've been really well received.

569
00:51:11,843 --> 00:51:17,088
Just to show some of the hidden gems that she knows about, I'm sure there's more to be uncovered.

570
00:51:17,729 --> 00:51:33,296
I mean, obviously, the sort of civic ancestors that she's invested in and that people are interested in are one of the reasons people go, but I mean, you have, I would say, maybe 70% of the people who go aren't there to find a specific historic gravesite.

571
00:51:33,316 --> 00:51:34,777
They're there because it's a beautiful place.

572
00:51:35,837 --> 00:52:03,862
And I was sort of hoping that was sort of the second thing that I wanted the photographs to show, not just sort of state of the trees, but also each of those photographs should sort of give you a sense of how intentional the landscape is, that the missing trees contribute to a very sort of specific view that you get when you're standing like at a particular crossroad of paths or when you're standing looking at a hillside and you can sort of see these arches

573
00:52:04,422 --> 00:52:05,663
running through the photographs.

574
00:52:06,944 --> 00:52:16,391
You can see in this one, right, this missing tree is part of a line of trees that lines this particular drive.

575
00:52:17,292 --> 00:52:26,398
And then here, the drive arches this way, and then there should be an arch of trees going this way, but they're missing their leaves.

576
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:31,142
And then on this one, again, there's sort of an arch

577
00:52:31,885 --> 00:52:35,806
of the path going this way, and I'm not sure which is going this way.

578
00:52:36,686 --> 00:52:49,269
And yeah, the chair of the historical commission is convinced that the same landscape architect designed Mount Auburn, Forest Hills, and the rock garden part of the cemetery.

579
00:52:50,729 --> 00:52:56,611
The historical research that I included in the application doesn't quite make that claim.

580
00:52:57,451 --> 00:52:58,531
They're of the same vintage.

581
00:52:58,911 --> 00:53:00,332
They're from the same school of thought.

582
00:53:02,332 --> 00:53:11,380
They're part of a related movement, but the research from the Historical Society doesn't quite make the claim that it's the same exact individual who designed them.

583
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:19,546
But again, I mean, you look at those photos and they could have come from any really beautiful Victorian garden cemetery of the period.

584
00:53:23,027 --> 00:53:23,547
Great.

585
00:53:23,567 --> 00:53:24,388
Thank you very much.

586
00:53:24,828 --> 00:53:25,869
Great presentations.

587
00:53:27,991 --> 00:53:37,438
And so we'll invite you to present on the Hickey Park improvement.

588
00:53:38,259 --> 00:53:39,320
I'm Cheryl Rodriguez.

589
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:44,464
I'm here to present the small grant application for the Hickey Park canopy project.

590
00:53:46,941 --> 00:53:53,488
I submitted this application through our PTO in cooperation with Brian Kearns, the head of the Medford DPW.

591
00:53:54,229 --> 00:53:58,874
I've been a resident about four houses away from this park for more than a decade.

592
00:53:59,014 --> 00:54:01,838
I walk there every day with my dog.

593
00:54:01,898 --> 00:54:05,141
I bring my daughter there to play and I look at this canopy and I say this is a

594
00:54:06,062 --> 00:54:07,923
This is an opportunity to be something.

595
00:54:08,663 --> 00:54:11,824
It's like a promise that wasn't quite fulfilled.

596
00:54:13,884 --> 00:54:19,846
And pretty much as soon as I moved in there, I started trying to find out a way to make this something.

597
00:54:20,006 --> 00:54:26,207
Why is there a canopy over a holy hard mound of dirt and nothing else?

598
00:54:27,308 --> 00:54:27,728
And so

599
00:54:29,602 --> 00:54:32,445
I found that this canopy was actually donated to the city.

600
00:54:33,205 --> 00:54:37,069
This structure is solid and will last us for decades to come.

601
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:51,283
So what we really need to make this a community gathering space, this park is so well loved and used, we could put the canopy right on top of there, put a couple of picnic tables underneath, and we have a community gathering space.

602
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:54,106
We have so many people using this park.

603
00:54:54,146 --> 00:54:56,829
We have the Roberts Elementary uses this.

604
00:54:57,169 --> 00:54:59,252
The PTO uses it for kindergarten playdates.

605
00:54:59,792 --> 00:55:01,194
The MFN is down there.

606
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:06,540
There's at least two daycares that I see walking with the little tow lines down to this park almost daily.

607
00:55:08,002 --> 00:55:18,808
We had a pickleball league of seniors this summer that was there that had brought their own folding chairs to sit under the canopy, and they could have sat at a couple of picnic tables and chatted and had a light lunch.

608
00:55:19,928 --> 00:55:27,172
The baseball field, the softball field, the tennis court, almost every day there's people there, the basketball courts.

609
00:55:27,192 --> 00:55:35,137
This is a well-loved park, and what it's lacking is a place to gather in the shade and just be in your community.

610
00:55:37,698 --> 00:55:44,127
a small change that would make such a huge difference in this park and it would be amazing for us.

611
00:55:44,827 --> 00:55:53,338
I did check in with the city, Lauren DiLorenzo and community development, the mayor's office and Brian Kearns and the DPW.

612
00:55:53,499 --> 00:55:54,880
There are no current projects to

613
00:55:56,642 --> 00:55:59,204
on line to change this park.

614
00:56:00,184 --> 00:56:14,074
But Brian stressed that if there were suddenly to be some grand plan that he would, this is such a strong canopy structure, that this is something they would uninstall and reinstall either here or somewhere else because this

615
00:56:14,634 --> 00:56:16,316
It's just an amazing structure.

616
00:56:16,436 --> 00:56:17,418
It's very large.

617
00:56:18,439 --> 00:56:24,746
If we put two picnic tables under here, there would still be room for someone to lay out a blanket or for kids to run around.

618
00:56:24,766 --> 00:56:31,034
This is just such a huge area that I would love to see more people enjoy.

619
00:56:35,003 --> 00:56:39,546
It's kind of a small project, so I don't really know any other questions that you have.

620
00:56:39,586 --> 00:56:41,627
The DPW would be installing this.

621
00:56:42,548 --> 00:56:47,451
They would be purchasing the materials just through a catalog that we purchased.

622
00:56:47,471 --> 00:56:48,451
They would be installed.

623
00:56:48,511 --> 00:56:50,853
They would be loved and used by the community.

624
00:56:52,385 --> 00:56:52,585
Yes.

625
00:56:53,005 --> 00:57:00,988
Would they be, so would they be like regrading or putting any new soil in or doing anything to the surface?

626
00:57:01,408 --> 00:57:06,370
Yes, the DPW would be making that a better area.

627
00:57:06,450 --> 00:57:10,031
And what would be under there, still grass or?

628
00:57:10,051 --> 00:57:13,252
I know they have to cement in the

629
00:57:15,102 --> 00:57:18,125
The tables, but there's not a plan to cement the whole area.

630
00:57:18,565 --> 00:57:22,469
But they do realize that they'll have to break that up.

631
00:57:22,549 --> 00:57:28,836
And would they have to uninstall it and reinstall it, or can they do the work around?

632
00:57:30,517 --> 00:57:33,160
There was no indications that they would uninstall it to do this work.

633
00:57:36,158 --> 00:57:37,799
Does the canopy need to be replaced?

634
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:40,299
The canopy's got some significant holes.

635
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:46,762
The amazing thing about it is if it's had some holes for 10 years and it's still retained this much.

636
00:57:46,822 --> 00:57:50,883
So this is a canvas that pretty much the warranty is about 10 years.

637
00:57:53,004 --> 00:57:58,785
But if it's kept well, the DPW thinks it'll last much longer.

638
00:57:58,905 --> 00:57:59,366
This one...

639
00:58:00,626 --> 00:58:02,310
Had holes in it a decade ago.

640
00:58:02,430 --> 00:58:05,095
So it's probably 15 or more years old.

641
00:58:05,736 --> 00:58:10,766
So it holds up pretty well It's a durable, you know heavy canvas

642
00:58:15,844 --> 00:58:16,845
I have a question.

643
00:58:17,125 --> 00:58:32,719
This is something that I'm not really entirely sure myself how the process works here in Medford, but in selecting the picnic table or whatever the furniture is that you put under the canopy,

644
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:49,053
Will the Commission on Disabilities be consulted or is there a process to ensure that handicap accessibility is taken into consideration in the selection of the furniture?

645
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:53,681
I can't answer that question.

646
00:58:53,901 --> 00:58:59,205
I know that this park underwent some updates to make it more ADA compliant.

647
00:59:00,126 --> 00:59:04,189
Actually, behind that area is where the handicap crosswalk is.

648
00:59:04,649 --> 00:59:12,875
They redid some of the pathways, extended them because you couldn't get from Park Street right into the park.

649
00:59:12,915 --> 00:59:14,717
You couldn't cross from Brogan

650
00:59:16,146 --> 00:59:17,767
to get to the other side for the park.

651
00:59:17,987 --> 00:59:21,709
It was harder to access the baseball field.

652
00:59:21,749 --> 00:59:23,910
So they did do some changes there already.

653
00:59:24,370 --> 00:59:27,252
There is right in front of this is pavement.

654
00:59:27,292 --> 00:59:34,176
So I imagine if they had if they needed to put a short jaunt, that could be something that they would achieve.

655
00:59:35,036 --> 00:59:38,078
They hadn't really thought that far just

656
00:59:38,722 --> 00:59:41,105
What can we put here to make this usable space?

657
00:59:41,145 --> 00:59:44,428
Because I wouldn't want to sit under there now.

658
00:59:44,688 --> 00:59:48,592
I've seen people put folding tables there and try to jockey them because it's not flat.

659
00:59:49,233 --> 00:59:51,375
But right now, it's pretty much unusable.

660
00:59:54,418 --> 00:59:54,799
Thank you.

661
00:59:56,140 --> 00:59:56,420
Thank you.

662
00:59:56,441 --> 00:59:57,321
Thank you, Renee.

663
00:59:57,562 --> 00:59:57,802
Thank you.

664
01:00:03,964 --> 01:00:07,827
All right, that concludes our presentations for this evening.

665
01:00:08,547 --> 01:00:17,353
We had one more presentation originally scheduled, but that's been rescheduled for next week, October 2nd.

666
01:00:17,453 --> 01:00:23,997
We'll have the second evening of candidate presentations.

667
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:37,372
So we have a couple of other items left on our agenda this evening, mainly to talk about the wrap-up and the next steps for the committee.

668
01:00:37,852 --> 01:00:40,115
Is there any comment before we move on?

669
01:00:43,396 --> 01:00:43,596
All right.

670
01:00:44,577 --> 01:00:46,457
Thank you.

671
01:00:46,798 --> 01:00:47,898
You can be excused if you want.

672
01:00:47,918 --> 01:00:48,478
You can stay.

673
01:00:48,498 --> 01:00:49,859
You're welcome to stay if you wish.

674
01:00:54,461 --> 01:00:55,802
Yeah, go celebrate your birthday.

675
01:00:59,944 --> 01:01:00,384
Thank you.

676
01:01:03,805 --> 01:01:08,147
So I'll give a moment to clear, and then I'll resume.

677
01:01:08,448 --> 01:01:08,828
Good night.

678
01:01:09,348 --> 01:01:09,808
Thank you.

679
01:01:09,988 --> 01:01:10,488
Thank you all.

680
01:01:14,782 --> 01:01:23,189
So I wanted to actually just talk about the next steps for now, because we have a little bit of time this evening.

681
01:01:23,969 --> 01:01:27,252
We have a shorter set of presentations.

682
01:01:28,393 --> 01:01:34,478
So this evening, we could take advantage of that to make sure that we have scheduled the meetings.

683
01:01:34,598 --> 01:01:38,041
And I think it would be a good idea to schedule meetings through the rest of the year.

684
01:01:40,963 --> 01:01:42,804
I just want to pull out my calendar for a moment.

685
01:01:44,125 --> 01:01:49,229
So I have listed what I think are the meetings that we need for the rest of the year.

686
01:01:49,749 --> 01:01:52,631
It's not as easy as one meeting per month, unfortunately.

687
01:01:53,632 --> 01:02:00,316
We need to have two meetings for deliberation after the presentations are completed.

688
01:02:01,657 --> 01:02:15,863
And then I see at least two meetings after that, one of which will be a preliminary discussion about the application process and priorities and criteria review.

689
01:02:17,803 --> 01:02:24,446
And then the other meeting is a hearing, public hearing to collect public input on those things.

690
01:02:27,427 --> 01:02:29,648
Then we'll also, I think,

691
01:02:32,921 --> 01:02:49,432
need a second meeting to finalize to accept our final revision of the priorities and criteria and application process, but that can go into January if we need to.

692
01:02:50,262 --> 01:02:58,086
So I'd like to schedule the four meetings, minimum of four meetings, or possibly five through the end of the year.

693
01:02:58,547 --> 01:03:05,030
Do we want to meet twice in October, or do we want to have a meeting in October?

694
01:03:05,070 --> 01:03:06,971
Do we want to continue with Tuesday evenings?

695
01:03:08,932 --> 01:03:14,177
I put some meetings on my calendar, but I don't know whether we had actually talked about those meetings.

696
01:03:14,297 --> 01:03:24,687
I have on my calendar October 9th and October 23rd, but I can't find in our minutes that we've talked about that together, so I might have made that up.

697
01:03:24,907 --> 01:03:25,507
I have the 9th.

698
01:03:25,848 --> 01:03:26,388
You have the 9th?

699
01:03:26,408 --> 01:03:28,530
I have the 23rd as a placeholder to be confirmed tonight.

700
01:03:28,931 --> 01:03:29,251
Okay.

701
01:03:30,192 --> 01:03:31,833
I can do the 9th, but not the 23rd.

702
01:03:32,414 --> 01:03:32,714
Okay.

703
01:03:33,214 --> 01:03:33,735
I can do both.

704
01:03:35,197 --> 01:03:35,437
Andre?

705
01:03:36,097 --> 01:03:37,178
I think I can't do that.

706
01:03:37,198 --> 01:03:38,638
I'll just double check.

707
01:03:39,318 --> 01:03:40,999
And are we meeting on the 2nd also?

708
01:03:41,399 --> 01:03:42,279
The 2nd, yes.

709
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:44,340
So that'll be three meetings in October.

710
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:45,480
That would be.

711
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:46,701
Yeah, it is a five.

712
01:03:47,381 --> 01:03:50,742
There are five Tuesdays in October.

713
01:03:50,762 --> 01:03:52,042
So it's three and five.

714
01:03:52,442 --> 01:03:54,423
Mom really wants to see us in October.

715
01:03:56,064 --> 01:04:02,050
I'm flexible.

716
01:04:04,492 --> 01:04:06,894
Because if we go to the 30th, we're still in October.

717
01:04:09,316 --> 01:04:10,157
Can we confirm the 9th?

718
01:04:10,197 --> 01:04:10,637
The 9th?

719
01:04:11,578 --> 01:04:12,259
Yeah, the 9th.

720
01:04:12,299 --> 01:04:14,721
So the second is obviously the presentations.

721
01:04:14,801 --> 01:04:17,824
The 9th we're going to discuss all the presentations.

722
01:04:18,195 --> 01:04:25,600
Yes, we're going to discuss them and take a preliminary vote on whether to recommend them.

723
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:34,426
And then the second meeting is going to be to finalize the language and the recommendations before we send it to City Council.

724
01:04:35,627 --> 01:04:36,868
I might not be able to do the 23rd.

725
01:04:37,570 --> 01:04:41,191
Okay, so ninth, we can confirm a yes.

726
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:45,413
But the 23rd looks like it doesn't work for a few people.

727
01:04:45,453 --> 01:04:46,713
And we're missing a few people.

728
01:04:46,813 --> 01:04:49,734
So we don't know whether they would be able to make that or not.

729
01:04:51,235 --> 01:04:51,835
How about the 30th?

730
01:04:51,915 --> 01:04:52,215
30th?

731
01:04:52,575 --> 01:04:56,076
Okay, good here.

732
01:04:56,116 --> 01:05:00,398
Alright, so let's cross out the 23rd and put the 30th for the second meeting.

733
01:05:07,318 --> 01:05:10,620
and that's for crafting recommendations to the city council?

734
01:05:10,881 --> 01:05:11,141
Yes.

735
01:05:16,044 --> 01:05:20,428
Just to be clear, we have October 2nd, 9th, and 30th, is that right?

736
01:05:20,448 --> 01:05:20,708
Yes.

737
01:05:21,268 --> 01:05:22,069
Because there's five.

738
01:05:22,589 --> 01:05:25,511
I know.

739
01:05:25,671 --> 01:05:29,114
And the 9th and 30th will be at the DPW, not here.

740
01:05:29,374 --> 01:05:29,814
Yes.

741
01:05:31,736 --> 01:05:33,297
Assuming we get that room right.

742
01:05:36,174 --> 01:05:38,376
We evicted him one time.

743
01:05:38,396 --> 01:05:42,098
We were the first ones to have the idea.

744
01:05:42,138 --> 01:05:44,860
Danielle, you have the inside track.

745
01:05:52,806 --> 01:06:18,206
City Hall do Then the following meeting or meetings can be in November December we could do one meeting in November and one in December if we wanted Probably preferable to have our preliminary meeting first and then have the public hearing and for the public hearing

746
01:06:20,167 --> 01:06:37,113
We need a quorum, but it's something that you can probably watch a video or read the minutes and We can have discussion about it afterward if everyone's not able to attend the hearing It's really a chance to at the City Council

747
01:06:37,974 --> 01:06:45,964
No, this is, we're required under the CPA legislation to have a hearing once a year.

748
01:06:46,725 --> 01:06:54,855
And I think that, they don't spell it out exactly, but I think that the purpose of that hearing is to let the public tell us what the priorities are.

749
01:06:55,642 --> 01:06:56,363
After the round?

750
01:06:56,963 --> 01:07:10,834
After the round is completed, before the next application process, we'll collect public input so that we can tell the applicants what the criteria are for, that we're looking for, for the following round.

751
01:07:11,775 --> 01:07:13,556
So then we will be able to

752
01:07:16,963 --> 01:07:19,925
launch the next round of funding in January.

753
01:07:20,645 --> 01:07:35,414
So we need to meet one more time after the, to approve the final application process and update of our criteria before we launch the round.

754
01:07:35,694 --> 01:07:42,978
So we could make that approval in early to mid-January and then launch the funding round in later January.

755
01:07:44,968 --> 01:07:55,192
Another thing to keep in mind is I reached out to the Chevalier Theater folks, and they intend to submit an off-cycle application in November, probably.

756
01:07:56,413 --> 01:07:56,553
OK.

757
01:07:56,613 --> 01:07:56,853
So.

758
01:07:57,213 --> 01:08:01,855
And they still anticipate a mid-January deadline with Mass Cultural Council.

759
01:08:02,775 --> 01:08:04,216
So we would have to build in.

760
01:08:04,576 --> 01:08:07,457
So if we plan a meeting in December sometime, then that would.

761
01:08:07,477 --> 01:08:08,738
It looks like it would have to be December.

762
01:08:09,058 --> 01:08:09,198
Yeah.

763
01:08:09,218 --> 01:08:09,978
So we would.

764
01:08:10,178 --> 01:08:14,020
So I don't know if we have to schedule another meeting, or if you could just include that.

765
01:08:14,853 --> 01:08:15,654
in the hearing?

766
01:08:15,694 --> 01:08:17,776
We can include it.

767
01:08:17,836 --> 01:08:21,539
I think we could include it if we do a December date, as long as, you know, it's on the agenda.

768
01:08:21,559 --> 01:08:22,340
I think we're okay.

769
01:08:23,581 --> 01:08:25,643
But that's one more item of business.

770
01:08:26,404 --> 01:08:31,668
Do we want to have that item of business at the same time as the hearing, or do we want the hearing to be?

771
01:08:31,768 --> 01:08:39,455
Although I'm just wondering, I mean, I don't think, I'm not expecting there to be a lot of feedback at the hearing right now that we've done this a couple of times.

772
01:08:39,475 --> 01:08:41,137
It's not like we're creating a new plan.

773
01:08:41,197 --> 01:08:42,018
It's really just,

774
01:08:43,908 --> 01:08:44,128
Right.

775
01:08:44,148 --> 01:08:46,010
You know, any course corrections.

776
01:08:46,470 --> 01:08:49,172
I can't imagine that's going to be super interesting to a lot of people.

777
01:08:50,733 --> 01:09:07,765
Actually, where I expect to get more input is we also would like to have a meeting during the daytime that city staff can come to and invite the staff people to provide feedback on the process.

778
01:09:07,986 --> 01:09:12,229
And I think that the people who have been involved particularly in

779
01:09:12,909 --> 01:09:22,779
So, managing the projects and helping to get the applications across the table to us will have a lot to say.

780
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:32,168
So, I think we'll probably get more feedback on the application process than necessarily the criteria and priorities.

781
01:09:34,342 --> 01:09:48,593
So there's one thing that we need to also be mindful of is that after we have crafted our recommendations we need to set up a Coordinated committee of the whole meeting to discuss remember like we did last year before the City Council meeting.

782
01:09:48,793 --> 01:09:59,642
Yes so That's a separate so our timeline is what we've just laid out for what meetings we need to have coming up but in addition to that

783
01:10:01,183 --> 01:10:23,377
We will, once we have approved the final language of our recommendations, we will immediately submit those to city council and the city council will want to have a committee of the whole meeting where they'll probably invite the applicants to present again for the city council's benefit.

784
01:10:24,277 --> 01:10:28,080
And so there will be,

785
01:10:28,980 --> 01:10:32,924
meeting with the Committee of the Whole and then a City Council meeting to approve.

786
01:10:33,024 --> 01:10:43,554
So there are two City Council meetings that committee members would be invited to attend, although it's not necessary if you aren't able to make it.

787
01:10:46,757 --> 01:10:48,939
And so those will likely take place in November.

788
01:10:49,805 --> 01:10:52,950
and captain because our recommendation meeting is on the 30th of October.

789
01:10:53,331 --> 01:10:53,611
Yes.

790
01:10:54,132 --> 01:10:59,961
If we stick to Tuesdays, there aren't a lot of Tuesdays in November that there's election day, which is a bad day to do anything.

791
01:10:59,981 --> 01:11:01,042
We wouldn't do election day.

792
01:11:01,062 --> 01:11:02,505
There's a week right after there are meetings.

793
01:11:02,545 --> 01:11:04,648
You have one week and then it's Thanksgiving week.

794
01:11:05,448 --> 01:11:10,691
So, November 13 is probably the date that we need to aim for our November meeting.

795
01:11:10,731 --> 01:11:11,572
I would agree with that.

796
01:11:11,832 --> 01:11:30,303
I was also going to ask, we had talked in previous meetings about revising our application process, incorporating that feedback into, after a few rounds, what were the questions raised, clarifications we know about, refining our process, not just what our goals are.

797
01:11:31,083 --> 01:11:35,266
are procedural things that would make it better and more understandable for candidates.

798
01:11:35,286 --> 01:11:35,366
Yeah.

799
01:11:35,546 --> 01:11:40,609
About what's in, what's out, you know, kind of FAQs, that kind of thing that would help the next round.

800
01:11:40,629 --> 01:11:41,210
Eligibility corner.

801
01:11:41,610 --> 01:11:41,910
What's that?

802
01:11:42,150 --> 01:11:43,371
The eligibility corner.

803
01:11:43,651 --> 01:11:43,871
Yes.

804
01:11:44,352 --> 01:11:47,854
Yeah, so that's what we'll be talking about in November.

805
01:11:48,294 --> 01:12:12,982
So, we have our discussion about what we'd like to update, and then we'll have the public hearing, and also a meeting, a stakeholder meeting, and then Danielle and I will work on drafting the revisions, and the committee will approve the final revisions likely in January.

806
01:12:14,162 --> 01:12:15,723
So, is there a December meeting or not?

807
01:12:16,192 --> 01:12:28,768
Yes, well the December meeting then will be the hearing and that will also likely be when we would be asked to approve or make a recommendation for the off-cycle application for the Chevalier Theatre.

808
01:12:28,788 --> 01:12:30,149
Okay.

809
01:12:33,934 --> 01:12:34,354
December 11.

810
01:12:35,377 --> 01:12:37,098
December 11th.

811
01:12:37,158 --> 01:12:38,219
It's second Tuesday.

812
01:12:38,259 --> 01:12:39,380
It's about four weeks.

813
01:12:39,701 --> 01:12:48,728
You know, yeah, it's not too crazy to December 11th is for which one for the hearing and the annual Chevalier.

814
01:12:49,228 --> 01:12:51,390
Yeah, the annual hearing and the Chevalier theater.

815
01:13:01,729 --> 01:13:05,606
So are we thinking will we hold that here or do we hold that at the DPW?

816
01:13:07,114 --> 01:13:10,795
The hearing here might be a good idea.

817
01:13:10,815 --> 01:13:15,175
What about the fire station?

818
01:13:16,336 --> 01:13:20,756
Well, here is beneficial if we want to have it recorded.

819
01:13:20,796 --> 01:13:24,657
This is the easiest place for us to have a meeting recorded.

820
01:13:26,317 --> 01:13:36,259
And I feel as though it's good to use our cable media when we have something that is explicitly for the public's benefit.

821
01:13:37,728 --> 01:13:37,909
Mm-hmm.

822
01:13:40,393 --> 01:14:05,319
And we may be able to at that point, since we will have already had a discussion about what we see as potential revisions to the application process and criteria, we might be able to give a little bit of a presentation about what we did this year, what changes we're talking about, and then invite people to provide some input.

823
01:14:05,419 --> 01:14:10,020
So we'll give them information as well as asking them for input.

824
01:14:13,153 --> 01:14:24,357
um all right great i think that that so we've got i think that over to october 9 october 30

825
01:14:30,743 --> 01:14:44,791
November 13 possible committee the whole meeting and then they'll have to schedule us We'll have to go to some their council meeting their next council meeting likely which may be the 20th may not Yes week of Thanksgiving.

826
01:14:44,811 --> 01:14:47,612
I don't have anything scheduled on the 27th of November

827
01:14:50,866 --> 01:14:59,832
So none of the projects right now are in a hurry to get going.

828
01:14:59,933 --> 01:15:07,358
So if the city council needs to take their time because the holidays get in the way,

829
01:15:10,278 --> 01:15:12,979
We can, you know, it may not happen right away.

830
01:15:12,999 --> 01:15:13,359
Right.

831
01:15:13,499 --> 01:15:19,301
I'm trying to remember also, didn't Ann Marie say there was a sweet spot time of the year for us to be granting stuff?

832
01:15:19,341 --> 01:15:23,442
Was it November after the CPA funding was?

833
01:15:24,583 --> 01:15:25,083
Oh, yeah.

834
01:15:26,063 --> 01:15:29,604
Like late October, early November is when DOR certifies the funds.

835
01:15:30,044 --> 01:15:33,445
So best to make the awards after that.

836
01:15:33,545 --> 01:15:37,767
So we're using known numbers instead of estimates.

837
01:15:39,222 --> 01:15:40,283
What was the date, after what date?

838
01:15:41,503 --> 01:15:42,444
It was approximate.

839
01:15:42,464 --> 01:15:44,304
It's approximate, November something.

840
01:15:44,805 --> 01:15:57,711
However, since our requests for this round are so far below the available funding, I think that the margin of error is probably well within what we can do.

841
01:15:57,731 --> 01:15:58,931
Right.

842
01:15:59,111 --> 01:16:06,915
Which leads me to my question, which is, on October 9th and 30th, do we think we need two meetings to do this?

843
01:16:08,308 --> 01:16:11,732
I think we could make decisions and then finalize the language on the same meeting.

844
01:16:13,234 --> 01:16:18,259
Because there are fewer and simpler summaries?

845
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:19,601
Well, we can try.

846
01:16:19,641 --> 01:16:21,883
And if we can't, then we'll just keep the other meeting.

847
01:16:22,824 --> 01:16:23,605
That's a good point.

848
01:16:24,246 --> 01:16:25,648
We can try and see what we do.

849
01:16:29,082 --> 01:16:33,088
If Andre makes his magic motion in the first 30 seconds, we'll be out of there in seven minutes.

850
01:16:33,148 --> 01:16:34,089
I'm going to have an omnibus.

851
01:16:34,109 --> 01:16:35,331
A proposed language, look at this.

852
01:16:46,486 --> 01:16:47,968
shortest meeting in history.

853
01:16:48,088 --> 01:17:06,928
It was helpful the last time even though we had the second meeting because of the error that we made in the approvals, but it was also helpful to actually have written out what the language was going to be so that we

854
01:17:08,110 --> 01:17:22,440
Because in writing it out, Danielle and I remembered some of the discussion and made sure that we incorporated the discussion about what were the important things that we wanted the projects to include.

855
01:17:24,242 --> 01:17:24,943
in that agreement.

856
01:17:25,284 --> 01:17:35,517
So we might be able to do it, but we might be able to have two short meetings instead of one long meeting where we try to perfect it, possibly.

857
01:17:36,979 --> 01:17:38,321
But we'll see what we can do.

858
01:17:42,385 --> 01:17:55,010
Perhaps you might be able to use a doodle poll to confirm everyone's availability, since not everyone is here this evening, to make sure that we can have a quorum for each of the nights that we've spelled out.

859
01:17:56,790 --> 01:18:02,893
For now, we'll just include the nights that we've already discussed in that poll.

860
01:18:04,415 --> 01:18:07,960
So I think that concludes what we needed to cover this evening.

861
01:18:10,082 --> 01:18:11,624
Is there a motion to close the meeting?

862
01:18:11,945 --> 01:18:12,966
Motion to close the meeting?

863
01:18:13,527 --> 01:18:13,947
Second.

864
01:18:14,889 --> 01:18:15,509
All in favor?

865
01:18:15,930 --> 01:18:16,330
Aye.

866
01:18:17,011 --> 01:18:17,732
Meeting is adjourned.
